The first time I saw you... [didn't like you. They say you're nothing... but a severe headache. When the Americans came and the Spaniards left... Fiizal's sister took his remains here in Paco Park... and transferred them to Luneta. Finally, she can get the letter he said he left inside his shoe. But it's too late. When she checked his shoe... there was nothing to be found. It has decayed. What did he write in that letter? He looked at me! Go girl! Okay class, that's H for today. H! see you all on Monday. You're dismissed. - Sir! - Ginny! Go and woo him! Sir! Wait. - This will be quick, promise! - Ms. Gonzales... Wait! But I'm going home... Just wait... Here... Oh! Move here... There... Yes, Ms. Gonzales? I don't want this to decay like Rizal's letter... because I believe that you should say what you want to say. Yes, Ms. Gonzales? What do you want to say? I love you, Sir... Today, February 14, 2004 will mark the history of our romance. Happy Valentine's Day, Sir. Next year, it's gonna be "Happy Anniversary," okay? Always the playful one, Ms. Gonzales. Thank you. We been in love with you for almost four years, Sir. Ever since the first day of our history class. Someday, I hope you realize that I also deserve this kind of love. How will he realize it if you don't send him that? Send what? Our silly friend is writing again at LetterLatencom. What's that? Just like FutureMe.com. You can email yourself or another person. And you can specify the date you want to receive it... or when you want the other person to receive it. What date? It depends. Could be weeks, months, years... from the day you wrote the email. The problem with Ginny is that... she's been writing Sir Marco for a hundred times now... but she has no guts to send it. Hey! Of course I'm gonna send it. Then let's do it now! No!!! Ouch! Ouch! I'm really going to send this! This is our vision of what the architectural building... will look like in the future. Oh, how nice! - It's something different. - It looks great. Ginny, I hope I live long enough to see this. Yes, Sir. I hope so, too. Congratulations again. Let's go over there ma'am. But I also have to admit... that even then... I knew that you had... something special in you. You had that spirit. Ginny, congratulations. Oh, thank you. Congratulations to you too! My grandma owns that house. I know, Sir. That's why I'm asking you if I can use her house... as the subject matter of my thesis next year. Come on... Marco! There you are! You know... I've been to three bookstores now but no... I still can't find that book! Too bad. I need it for reference. Sir! As I was saying... for my thesis next year... your grandma's house... I got you fried bananas. Bananas! - Thank you, Gi... Gi... - Ginny. Ginny. Bye! Thank you! Bye... Ms. Lala Lioness ate you alive again. Aren't they together? Of course not! This is a [ail booth! Not a marriage booth! I'll just borrow this! There are no more handcuffs in the marriage booth! I'll return it to you right away! No! Your money's not enough. This is 150 pesos. You only gave me fifty pesos. - I don't have money anymore! - That's my last money. I'm broke. We already gave up our ieepney fare... so you can follow Sir Marco in the horror booth. There are ants all over you! Wait! Wait! Si" Sir! Girls what's this? Sir, will you marry me? Si" She's not yet fully paid! You can't get married! She's a cheater! Sir, we're fully paid. So you have to marry Ms. Lala. Sir, please... you belong to me... Hake thee, Lala Flores... to be my lawfully wedded wife... to have and to hold... from this day forward... for richer or for poorer... in sickness and in health... in sickness and in health... Till death do us pan. You've been ignoring him for so long. You said he has one year to enjoy himself. It hasn't been a year! Sir Marco! Ms. Torres! Are you done enrolling? Not yet, Sir. The queue is still long. Ah... Sir! Ginny... Ouch. Ms. Gonzales! Do you still want to use our house for your thesis? Yes. This house was built by my father in 1935 Four generaons of our family have lived here. My father put a lot of value in education... that's why almost of all of us became teachers. A lot of things have happened in this house. In World War II... Ma... What took you so long? We got stuck in traffic. Did you bring pudding? Yes, it's with Marco. Ginny, my parents. This is Ginny. Ginny. You want some pudding? No, Sir. I'm still full. You were saying? You see the Pasig River? Papa used to tell us before... Santa Ana was the Tagaytay of that era. A real vacation area where you can rest, spend time with your family... Growing up... for us, this has been our refuge. We love this house. But sadly, I think it's time for us to let it go. We're actually looking for a buyer. Too bad... - Only few of its kind had... - Wait, let me find it. survived through the years. Don't sell it. Well, most of the family are either abroad or in Pampanga. We're also there most of the time because we're building a school there. Anyway, ifs only Marco who stays here. Are you okay? Yes. It's ten 0' clock. Public transport is three blocks away. And every block, there are men drinking. I'll bring you home. Well, Sir Marco... If you insist, how can I resist? Where's your dorm? Oh, no. I go home during weekends to my father. Where does he live? In Batangas. In Batangas? You can't take it back anymore. You said you'll drive me home. Just remember this... That one with the open gate. - My love for you won't change - Thank you. You know your way home? - Even if we're apart. - Oh'. Pa'. Pa'.! Even through the storm-- This is the theme song of my Mama and Papa. My Papa plays this song when A) He's happy or B) He's sad. Oh! No! No! No! No need. I'm okay. Papa and I have a routine. Pa! Come on! In one, two, three! Okay, let's go. You made me admire you more... when you let me see your world. There you go again, Pa. I thought we've moved on already? Mama's already happy in Spain. Stop hoping already. We've already talked about this. You're by far... the bravest girl We ever met. Days, weeks, months passed. I don? know if ifs because... you opened your heart to me. Actually, Ginny acts better. I don? know what worked more for you... your persistence or your prayers? But Ma'am Elsa, does she look like Mama Mary? Rose, I think you got a point. I think ifs because... you prayed so hard. Ginny! That's why I'm giving myself a deadline. And that's on my last Christmas in this university. I'm sending this letter on this day, November 25. That's today. So I have an ultimatum? Actually, until December 25, Sir. Here. This is my favorite part of your letter. They say... "Give love on Christmas Day." So give me love, Sir. But if you feel nothing for me... just tell me, how do I unlove you? Sir, if you're going to reject me, can you not do it today? Because this is going to be my second rejection. It's too painful already. You got rejected? They said... I don't look like Mama Mary so I didn't get the role in the play. Is that so? Well, that's what they think. But for me... you don't need to look like Mama Mary for me to fall in love with you. I don't want you to unlove me, Ms. Gonzales. What? Because I love you. You love me? Yes. You're my boyfriend now? Yes. I'm your girlfriend now? Yes. Oh sheesh! Thank you! Merry Christmas! I love you! I love you! I love you, Sir! If you only knew! Can I kiss you now? Yes. Thank you, Lord! Merry Christmas! More than three years and I thought we were good. More than three years going on forever... or so I thought. I don? know why... or how.. or when H started. What happened to the two of us? Why did we break up? Why did you leave me? But today, I resolve to stop bothering you. I have decided 10 lei you be and give you the space that you asked for. That's why I'm sending this email, four years from this day. You'll be 30 years old by then. You would've been to places. You would've met a lot of people. You would've accomplished things. I hope you have done everything you wanted. I hope four years is enough for you to be sure... that I'm the one you want to be with for the rest of your life. H! wait for you, Ginny. H! wait knowing that one day... H! be back in your life. And I will do everything it takes to win you back. I will never lose hope... that we will eventually have our second chance. I won? ever lose hope. Happy bi... Hi, Aunt Ginny! Are you okay? This email was sent 2009, so four years ago? Is there really a website like that? There. LetterLatencom. FuiureMacom. OnThisDay.com. We been searching for him for so long! In Facebook... I even googled Marco Villanueva to no avail! Now see, he made his way back 10 Ginny, in a very romantic way. But is this still true now? Not anymore. How come? So he was just emotional when he wrote it in the past? Yes! Past. That's the operative word! This was the past and that's the end of the story. What if their love story is "to be continued?" Come on. Stop romanticizing things. This isn't a soap opera. Wait, so what really happened to them? The point is, this isn't helping Ginny move on. So let's stop this. We have to delete this. No! Not now. Who knows, there might be another chance. You two are crazy. Baba, please help me here. Thais why I never liked the idea of you going back there. Too many things are holding you down. Here in Barcelona, you had a nice job. You're on your way up. Then you left everything. For what? Ma, I came back here because I need to take care of Papa. Sometimes, I think you're just using him as your excuse. Truth is, you just want to see Marco. Happy birthday, big sister! Thank you! Tell me, Ma. Didn't you regret leaving Papa? Is H Throwback Thursday today? I don't think so. You never thought of coming back to him? Pa, why don'! you just live here in Manila? If it's getting inconvenient for you to go home to Batangas-- That's not what I meant, Pa. Come on. Haven't you forgiven me until now? That I left you? I'm used to being left behind. Pa! Pa, I was talking to Mama... She said there was a time that... she almost came back to us. But she was afraid that we might not take her back. If she came back, would you have forgiven her? Would you have taken her back? How can I answer that? She never said that. What if she did? It never happened. But what if? Yes. Oh! This is huge. He also has a restaurant in Parafiaque. That was the first. His family is also into trading. Ah... Milo? Migo. Migo Mafiego. They are there, Sir. No problem. Oh okay. Thank you. Ginny. - Hey, how are you? - Hey! Ali! - I'm okay, bro. - Ginny! It's been like what? Four years? How are you? I'm okay! I have two kids now. You? You're looking great! By the way, this is Migo Mafiego. He is the owner of the restaurant. Hi. Hi. We'll be meeting with him today, and Marco. Marco? Marco. Yes. Marco Villanueva. He's our executive chef. You know him, of course. I know him... Of course. Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! He's here... We're in one building together. We're breathing the same air. Why is this happening to me? We can say no and just leave! But I just want to see him again. I want to know why. What? Why do we have to see each other again? Marco, Ginny's here. How are you? Hi. Gosh, I can'! believe you're starting a restaurant! We also can'! believe that you're married! He was very persistent. He followed me to Dubai. - Wow... - You know... True love... I didn't know you worked in Paris? After I studied in New York, yes. You also went to Spain? Madrid. Then I went back to New York. Then last year, I came home here. Ah, Ginny... As we discussed earlier... we're planning to open a new restaurant. It's gonna be Marco's second. My first with Ali. We've gone through a lot of architects but nobody suits Marco's taste. Then I saw you in a mall. So I joked Marco about hiring you as our architect... and he agreed. I'm glad you agreed. Why not? Ah... well. You made the right decision. As you can see, we're a one-stop shop. We have architects and a contractor. I don't want to brag, but Ginny has a Master's degree. She went abroad, and studied for two years in Barcelona. Uhm, what property of yours are we converting into a restaurant? Oh. The old house in Sta. Ana. Yeah. So you're finally making the dream come true. Well, that's why I called for you guys, because we want to know if you can do it. I want the restaurant operational in six months. That's too soon. We're following a timetable. I'm proposing in six months. And I want it to happen in that restaurant. Proposing? We forgot to tell you that... the restaurant is not just owned by the four of us. There's another part-owner. Patricia De Guia. Marco's girlfriend. Patty is a pastry chef. She's just in the US right now finalizing a contract. But when she gets back, she'll be very much involved in the renovation... because that's really her and Marco's idea. You? What's your secret? You want the truth? Maybe it's that... even if I love Papa so much... I sometimes wish I had a different father. Someone... who has a strong heart... who wouldn't go home after two years from Saudi, just because he misses his family. Someone who wouldn't give up when he loses in business. Maybe Mama wouldn't leave to work abroad. Maybe... Maybe until now, our family is still whole. Because you will teach the world to pray... I give you frankincense... Because you will save the world from suffering, I give you myrrh... Each of the three wise men gave Jesus a precious gift. And they went home even wiser men... Because they know that precious things... What are you doing there? Promise you'll think of me? Promise. Every second? Every minute. Of every day'? Promise. Hey, Sir. Is everything okay, sir? A cat! Go away! There's a cat. A noisy cat. A flirty cat. Me, I just want to be a chef! Why don't you study culinary arts? Try it! Come on. You can be an Iron Chef. You think? Yes! You're good! And you'll make a lot of people happy. That's precisely what my Grandpa said. Taste it. It's delicious. What do you remember? What? What thoughts come to mind with what you just tasted? Uhm, happy thoughts! Just like... a celebration, a feast! Like that. Isn't it amazing? I've always loved how food can preserve memory. A feeling. Even food has history? How about me? What taste will make you remember me? Oh, well. I have to taste you first. Really? Of course. So I'd remember. Salty... appetizing. Sour... The taste of romance. Sweet... The taste of love. Delicious. The taste of forever. Ouch! Sorry. Sorry. What's that noise? I love you, Ginny! We're legal now! We're legal now! Hold your knives properly. Concentrate on the accuracy and consistency and not speed. Learn how to cut your ingredients in uniform sizes. Slice the cucumbers. Chop the garlic. Uniformity is the key to cook the ingredients fairly. Right? Instead of your Grandma selling this house, turn it into a restaurant. This will be our future, babe. I can see it. The two of us. My wife is really talented! Why? Don't you want to be Mrs. Villanueva? Why? Why Ginny? Because... You're stupid!!! You're so stupid!!! You're already the girlfriend and you let go of him! You did nothing for four years! You didn't write him! You didn't call him! You're full of pride! Pride! Pride! You courted him for so long! You're too proud of yourself... You think you're so beautiful? Look at your jaw! Maybe you were just afraid? That's not an excuse! It's still the same! Maybe you were afraid to get rejected? You're too slow! Somebody got to him first! There's a new woman! A new one! A new one! I'm so tired of crying... Beb is right. I have to move on. This email isn't true. I have to delete you. I have to delete you from my life. Come on... No!!! I'll delete it... Don't delete it!!! Come on! Ginny... Gin"!!! Come on!!! Hi love! Hi love! What are you doing? I'm just checking my investments. Looks like I have enough for the business. That's good. So, did Ginny accept H? Yes, she did. Really ? I was hoping she wouldn't. Pats... Love... If you're not comfortable, just tell me. I'll take back the project. Why? Do I have anything to worry about? Nothing. Are you jealous? A bit. Well, she is your ex. But that's it, fight? She's just your ex. Of course, love. I wish you were here. I wish your contract there is done. Love, two more months, okay? I love you. I love you. I miss you. Why? Why are you staring at me like that? I miss you. I miss kissing you. I miss hugging you. Love, I have 10 go. My break time is over. I miss making love to you. You know, Mr. Villanueva... If you don? stop this... Later... Well! surely have a sex video. - Game! - Joke! So our homecoming is this October. Ginny, H! stay at your place, okay? Let's focus on me, first. Okay? Babe, hurry up! We're running late! Okay, read! One day... I will be back in your life and I will do whatever it takes to win you back. I will never lose that hope that we will have our second chance. Beb... Baba... How old am I now? 30, check! Did he come back? Check! Beb, I just need to know. What? Why he came back. Ginny, what you don't know won't hurt you. That's just pride, Beb. I don't want to end up like my parents... who missed their chance because of their pride. Hurry up! There's heavy traffic in the expressway! I'm coming'. What a huge house! Three storeys... Good morning. Let's go. Oh, you're here. - I hope you didn't get lost coming here. - Hi! Oh! Sorry! Are you okay? Good morning. How are you? I'm okay. Follow me? - Here. - Okay... You have a big house, chef. This is owned by the family. Here. Please. Come. Let's taste this. Okay... Beb... Thank you... There. How does it taste? Tastes like what? Weird... Tastes like sour pork stew but, why is there no soup? That's exactly my point! It's a modernized version of the classic sour pork stew. What? Your family cooks sour pork stew so well! Why did you change it? Because the concept of this restaurant is Filipino with a twist. So I want the restaurant's design to match the concept of our food. Wait, what you're saying is you want to renovate the house? But Ginny's specialization is restoration. Right, Ginny? Really? So we're not talking about any project here, right? Oh! Oh! Oh! No! Wait, wait, wait. I'm an architect. I can also do that. I just didn't expect that the changes will be this drastic. Anyway, out of curiosity, what did your Grandma say? Is this okay with her? She's no longer here to tell me if I'm right or wrong. She passed away? She died a year after you left. Babe! Hey! Guess what? The team who'll be doing our restaurant is here! Babe, I want you to meet... Beb... Baba... - and Ginny. - Hi. Guys, this is my girlfriend Patty. Hi guys! Sony, Fm just not feeling well. Hi, Ginny. It's nice to finally meet you. Thank you... We'll go ahead. What's wrong? She looks like Mama Mary. What? Mama Mary? She has a deep-seated issue with Mama Mary. Why does she look like Mama Mary? Why? Lord? Is there a problem? I'm just looking for my contact lens. She's looking for Mama Mary. What Mama Mary are you talking about? My contact lens is missing! - It fell somewhere here. - Yes! Contact lens! Where could it be? You left the blueprint. Oh! Thank you. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Let's go. We'll just buy a new lens. You're going to work with your ex! And with your ex's present girlfriend! It's complicated! It's a recipe for disaster! Beb, everything is clear to me now, as clear as Mama Mary's apparition... that it's over between me and Marco Villanueva. So it's settled. But, we're professional here. I can be professional. But... Baba said our company needs this project, right? Oh yes, but... No worries, my friend. From now on... PSP. PSP? Past iS Past. He's about to go down, Ma'am. Really? Herman! Is this beam a new addition? Isn't it there in the plan? No. Can you check if this can cover the whole area until outside? Okay, later. No. Now. Do it now. Check it now. What about this? I'll take care of that. Give that to me. - Now? - Yes, now. Come on... Come on... Look for Mang Jojo. Ask for his help. Quick! Check the measurement outside. - Okay. - What? Okay. Good morning. Oh. Hi! Good morning. Oh... Sorry. I'm measuring something. Are you okay? Yes. Thank you. Okay. Genina... Behave. Behave. Closer, baby. It just needs one touch. Then it'll come out of the TV. - See! Isn't it great? - Oh, hello? Marco! Oh, Ali... We already studied what you sent. But Marco didn't approve it. He said it no longer looks like a Filipino restaurant. Is he there? Can I talk to him? Oh, no, no, no. It's our service time. Chef, it might get too salty again. Customers were complaining that the pork blood stew was salty. What? Marco's pork blood stew was salty? Is he sick? No. No. Uhm... Peewee is the one who's salty. Okay, okay. No, no, no, no. This is not H. It's still lacking some details. Look, Ginny. If this is becoming difficult... No, no, no, no, no. No. It's okay. Uhm, here's what I'll do. I'll revise the layout. Then H! show you some pegs. Dude! She still wants you, man. Stop pestering Marco. No. I really saw it. So what, Marco? Should Ginny keep her hopes up? No, she shouldn't! Wanna bet? Me? I'll bet on Marco and Ginny. What? Okay! Go! - Cheers! - To our bet! Cheers! Hi, Marco! We're here in your house. Too bad I didn't catch you. I wanted to personally hand you the revised plan. It's so hard to catch up with your time lately. Oh no, Ginny. I left the house early. I didn't know you're coming. Fm on my way 10 Ortigas. I'm running late for a meeting. I can give it to you there! No hassle at all. I wanted to give it to you personally so I can get your feedback right away. Okay. See you! Oh. Ginny! You can just leave the plan with the househelp, right? This is going to be quick, I promise! Hello, Ginny. Sorry! Sorry! Traffic is so bad! Yeah. I couldn't wait for you. I had to pick up something at Roxas Boulevard. You know what... Just leave it at the restaurant. No! No! No! It's okay. Roxas Boulevard is just nearby. I can give it to you there. I'll see you! Marco is giving us the runaround! Don't you think he got you just so he can get back at you? Whatever. You guys take care of Mr. Aguinaldo. I'll just take a cab. Ginny! Taxi!!! Wait! Hey! Oh! Wait! Wait! Wait! Hey! That's mine! That's-- That's mine! Wait! Hey!!! Wait! I was here first! Hey, I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry! Hey, don't ignore me! Hey! Open this! Hey! I was here first! Hey! That's rude! How crass! Such an asshole! You have no respect! You're shameless! Okay... There... Went past me. Hey! Miss! - Wait! - Sir! Sir! - I was here first! - Ouch! This is my cab! Get your own cab! Whatever! You want a fight? I told you this is mine! I'm going to be late for school! There goes the taxi again... It's your fault. Don't touch me! Oh... hello? Hello, Ginny? I'm really sorry. I'm on my way to Alabang. I have to catch a meeting there. What? Alabang? Okay. In 15 minutes. Okay. Bye. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Ouch. Sir! Sir! What's the fastest way to Alabang? Don't call me Sir! Is that what happened? No! I told him... Hello, Marco? Marco? Hello? Hello? Hello, Marco? I'm here. Sorry, sorry... I'm here in Alabang. I'm here at the restaurant. Ali called me. We had to fix some problems for our catering. Is that so? Will that take long? Do you still have other errands to attend to? I don? know yet. I still have a meeting at Tagaytay later. Who are you meeting with at Tagaytay? Wow, Tagavlav! Ah, Ginny. I gotta go. Okay, We- Marco! Ma'am Ginny wanted to give this to you. Give me the laundry. [Marco's Restaurant. Second proposal. I wasn't able to catch you.] [Just let me if this is a go or a no. Ginny.] [Marco: Just saw your revision. Still not working. Sorry.] - Is chef there? - Good morning, Ma'am. He's inside. Here he is. At last, I was able to catch you! Hi. It's not yet six. I was calling but you weren't picking up. I called your house and your househelp said you left already. So I thought, I'd just go straight here. I haven't slept revising this. Show it to Ali first. Can you check it first? So we can save time. Besides, you're the final say, right? You know what, next time, you can just email me so you'll save yourself the hassle of coming here. It's okay. We haven't seen each other for so long. It's time that we catch up on each other. You've changed so much. Well, I hope it's a better Marco. It's the Marco I've always wanted you to be. The Marco you've always wanted me to be? That's interesting. Am I still interesting? To you? Just asking. Do I still affect you? Again, just asking. No. Oh, so that's why you've been avoiding me? It's too early for you to be here. Why? You also couldn't sleep? Look at that. That isn't your job but you're doing it. And you tell me you're not affected? Look, Ginny. Why did you get me as your architect? Because you said you can do the job. There are other architects out there. Don't flatter yourself. I'm a businessman. I needed someone who can get the job done. Why didn't you follow me to Barcelona? Are you serious? That's what you asked for, right? If you really loved me, you should have followed me. If you really loved me, you shouldn't have left me. And I regret that everyday. Are you flirting with me? Do you want me to? L... have a girlfriend. And you intend to propose to her in six months. So I'm asking you... Do you want me to? No. You sent me an email four years ago at LetterLatencom. I received that on my birthday. I can't remember. "I'm sending this email four years from now. I hope that's enough for you to know that I'm the one you love. I hope you have done everything you wanted. I hope you'll be ready to accept the love I have to offer by the time you get this email. One day, I'll be back in your life again and I'll do everything it takes to win you back. I will never lose hope that eventually... we will have our second chance. No matter what happens, no matter how long... I will never lose hope." Is that still right, Marco? Is that still true? Is that why you got me as your architect? Do you still want us to have our second chance? Marco? Marco... Shit... What happened? We're locked in! Guard! We're locked in? We're locked in! Guard! So what now? Guard!!! We're locked in! I can't die yet. I can't die. I still want to do a lot of things. Guard!!! You need to open this. Open this! We're locked in! We're going to die here! It's so cold... Guard! Sir! Sir? You're locked in? Yes! Get the key! Where? I don't know! Do something! Get anything! Break this door! Okay, just stay there! Ginny? Hang on. Hang on. Marco... If we die now... Can you answer my question, please? Does the email still hold true? Do we still have a second chance? Do you also believe that our love story deserves a better ending? Marco! Ginny! Hang on! Well! get you out of there! This house was built in 1935 Sta. Ana was the Tagaytay of that era. That's why if you'll notice the architecture of the house... H resembles that of a villa. Big doors... Big windows... Sprawling garden... Verandas... Big and wide spaces... Its very simplicity is what makes homey. Warm. And as what Marco's grandma used to say... Wait. What's this? I thought you understood that I wanted it modern? Don't force restoration just because it's your specialization. Oh no, Marco. No, not because of that. Marco, why don't we give Ginny a chance? I mean, everything she seems to be saying right now is quite interesting. Besides... Old houses being turned into restaurants is the trend right now. The last one was in San Juan, right? The one owned by Chef Laudico. Marco, please? If you still don't like the idea after this presentation... you can replace us. I've already presented a lot of ideas but you haven't chosen anything. I even thought... Maybe you've already chosen one. But you just don't want to admit it. Because you don't want to look back. Remember this? It all started here, right? We threw in a lot of ideas for months. The plan was made for countless nights. Because you said... This restaurant is going to be special. This will be our future, babe. My wife is really talented. Don? you want to be Mrs. Vianueva? And as your customers eat... they will not only experience your family's legac y... but they will also have a chance to add to the many memories that this house holds. So for every mouthful... remember... that my heart beats only for you. Remember? It's your dream? It will honor your grandfather's philosophy that cooking is generosity. Cooking is your way of giving love... And love... And love... And love... And love... Ginny? Babe? Will you marry me? I'm sorry... Ginny! Ginny wait! What did I do wrong? How did it come to this? You're making me look like a fool. You're so unfair. If you want, I'll just go with you to Barcelona. But you don? like H there. I'm okay. I'm okay to go with you. I don't think that's possible... Mama got mad already. Don't make me run around in circles, Wella! Have pity on me! Tell me, is Ginny leaving today for Barcelona? I really don't know, Marco. I came from Batangas. He! father is not there. They said he went to Manila, to bring Ginny to the airport. Is that true? Her father is not here. I don't know, Marco. Sorry. Damn! Damn it! Don't fool me! Wait! Wait! Stop! Stop this! Open the door! Ginny! Ginny, open the door! Don't leave me! Marco, stop itmplease! Let's talk! Open the door! Ginny! Ginny, open the door! Wait, Ginny! Ginny! Ginny, open the door! Ginny, talk to me, babe! Uncle Ben, please... Uncle Ben, open the door. Babe... Babe, don't do this to me... Babe, have pity on me. Don't do it! Let's go. Ginny! Straight to the airport! Come on! Hey! Babe, wait! Hey! Don't leave me, Ginny! Ginny! Damn it, Ginny! Ginny! Ginny! Ginny! Ginny! Ginny! Wait! You really didn't like the design? You're the ones who said that if I don't-- You really didn't like it? In what way do you want me to tell it to you so you'd get it? In a way that is true! I didn't like it. Okay? I don't believe you. You know what, Ginny? I don't care. You can leave. There's nothing else to talk about. Beb was right. You really have no plans of pushing through with this project. You just accepted this to get back at me. What made you think of that? Either that or you really liked the plan... - but you just don't want to accept... - You're still the same Ginny. - That I'm part of it. - You won't stop until you get what you want. Or maybe you just don't want to admit that I'm still the one you want-- Wow! Really? So why? Tell me why you didn't like it! I deserve an explanation! What? What did you say? I need an acceptable reason. Why? Because I worked on it. I worked hard for it. I invested my time and my effort. That's why you need to know what's wrong? Yes! Because if there's a problem, then I'll fix it. Because it's not just your time and effort that you invested, right? But your heart and soul. Right? Because you did it... for that person whom you thought still trusts you and believes in you. Right? That if you make mistakes... You think she'd give you a chance to correct them. Because she made you believe she loves you. That you're important to her. That you share the same dream. That you have the vision of the same future, right? You need to know... why one day when you woke up, everything suddenly changed. Why is she gone? Why are you alone? You need a reason, right? You need something to hold on to. Or understand why you were made to look like a fool. That you looked like shit to everyone. Even to yourself. Because you don't know how. You don't know when. You don't know what happened. What's wrong with you? Why did she leave you? Marco... How dare you ask for something you refused to give? Marco... Marco... I deserved an explanation. I deserved an acceptable reason! Marco, I'm sorry. So why? Why didn't you tell me the truth? I was afraid. And you expect me to believe that? With that courage of yours? I didn't want to hurt you, Marco. I almost died. And everyday... I Wished I did. Tell me! I was beginning to see my father in you. A loser... With small dreams. Marco... How can I tell you that? That my respect for you is slowly fading... That I didn't look up to you anymore... That I was afraid that we'd end up like my parents. Even if it hurts, you should've told me. You know what died in me, Ginny? Trust. I can't trust you anymore. Marco... Marco wait... I'm sorry. I will tell you again and again that I'm immature. Please forgive me, Marco. I'm sorry. - Marco. - You're four years too late, Ginny. But we met again, Marco. If you didn't receive that email, if Ali didn't call you, we wouldn't have met. But we met again. And I've been asking, what for? Or why? There's a reason, right? Marco. - Please leave! - No! We still have a second chance. Marco please... I moved on with my life, Ginny. No... - Come on, please... - No... Marco, please... Is this what you want? Is this what you want? You should've finished your last year. What a waste. It's different when you have a diploma. When you have a diploma, you're not just a cook. You're a chef. I just want to put up a restaurant. Uncle Ben, I don't need a diploma for that, right? "Ism! Just pay me your tuition. It's cheaper that way. Come on, babe... I don't want to let go of Mama's offer to pay for my Master's Degree in Spain. Tempting, right? She said she's going to find you a job there. You can apply in restaurants. There are a lot of Filipinos there. At least we're together. What about our restaurant? I gave it at 60 pesos. 60 pesos per head? But they want a lot of dishes. Babe. We're losing money again. So what's your plan now? I still don't know. Well... maybe I'll try again. I'm sorry. What did I do wrong? If you want, I'll go with you to Barcelona. I thought you don't like it there? I've been asking you before but you said you don't like it there. I'm okay. I'm okay to go with you. I don't think that's possible. Mama got mad already. Hello, Ma. We're on our way to the airport. You'll be late for your ight. You better leave now cause the rain is pouring so hard. Wait! Wait! Stop this. Stop! Who's that? Marco again? - Marco, stop it. - You go now! Get away! Ginny! Don'! mind him! He's not good for you. Didn't I tell you? He's going to end up like your father. - Be brave. - I can't do this anymore... You have to leave. - This is where your future is. - I can't do it, Ma. You have to leave now! - I can't leave Marco. - You'll end up nowhere with that man! Ginny! Ginny! I was just busy. We have a lot of clients for our catering. Yeah, Ali mentioned that. Anyway, that's good, right? So We seen your email and I saw Ginny's proposed design. You're right, Marco. She's good. Actually, even Migo and Peewee really liked the plan. Did you like it? Honestly... Yes. Because, it's how I've always seen it. It's like looking at my dream restaurant. So you mean this is really how you want it? Yes, because she preserved the beauty of your ancestral home... and Fm sure your Grandma would have found it beautiful. Wake up! No... You've been like that for four days! You stink! You're harsh, Beb. Can't you see she's broken-hearted? You're not helping. I just got here yesterday. So that's why you guys got drunk? Ginny, you have to eat. Come on! You have to eat so you can work. Yes, Ginny. I don't know what to tell our clients anymore. Our projects with them are so delayed. Let's forget about Marco. They're making us go in circles. As far as I'm concerned, that is a dead project. Something happened between them. What happened? What happened? Something happened?! It's... It's Marco. What? Who? Give that to me! Hello? Marco? Hi Ginny! This is Patty. Patty? Marco's girlfriend. I just got in yesterday. Yes and I was hoping that maybe we could meet? Meet? Yes, about the design. Yes, because Marco finally approved it. "'5 approved? Yes. Is that okay with you? Are you free tonight? Sure. I'm free tonight. Okay, great! 9:30 P. M. ? Meet you at Migds? Maybe we could have late dinner? Okay. I'll be there. Bye. Bye. You're my friend. And I refuse to watch you kill yourself. Beb, please try understand... You're the one who can? understand! You're the reason why Patty exists. Because when you left Marco, you gave him the right to love someone else! If you won't shape up then let's just close this company. Are you sure that's all you're having? Ah, yes. My tummy is aching. Anyway, if you don't have any more questions... Actually, I do have a question. I studied the plan very well. And Ginny, it's good. The plan is good but it seems like you forgot something. Where am I in the plan? I mean... I will need my own space for baking and... Hon, ifs not yet final. I know. I know. I'm sure Ginny will give me my space. Right, Ginny? Ginny! What happened between us... That's nothing. Forget about it. Come on. Let's bring this inside. Snacks! From our boss! Come on, let's eat! Let's have some snacks. Come on. Here are some noodles. Good afternoon, Ma'am. What are you doing here? I thought you're with your child? He's well now. He got discharged from the hospital. - He's recovering at home. - Really? That's good. Come, let's eat. Let's eat. Let's all eat. Sir! Let's eat. Thank you. You like it? What's that smell? What's that? That's my surprise for you. - What surprise? - Wait... Ready? What happened? I'm sure I did everything that was needed. Why didn't it rise? Baking powder. Baking powder, right Love? Yes. I added baking powder. I followed all the measurements. And I was constantly checking it while I was baking. I almost used up all the toothpicks out of checking. I checked on it too much. Didn't I? Love, you worked hard on this, right? Yes. And were you trying to make me smile? Yes. Okay. So that means that you baked this with love. All for you. That's all that matters, Love. Love... I want to tell you something. Thank you. Come, let's share this. Hi, Ginny! You want some snacks? No, it's okay. I already ate. Are you sure? Yeah. Thank you. I'll just garnish this. Okay. Nothing beats your foolishness over Washington! I was so stupid, right? Now I have three children. Three times, I was stupid! I'm so tired of childbirth! Why is it like that, Wella? We're so stupid. - Right? - Yes. Every morning... I slap myself again and again saying... "Ginny... you're educated. You even have a Master's Degree in Barcelona. Your parents didn't pay for your education so you can go crazy over a guy." I understand everything that Beb says. I know what's right. But why is it like that? When I'm faced with him... I can't do it. You know why? Because you're still hoping. That hope is a poison. It's like drugs. It's addictive. Without hope... It's so painful... So painful... Hey, be strong. Accept it until it heals and disappears. He was so mad. What's happening? Ma'am, Chef Peewee and his two assistants got sick. Manang is on leave because her son just arrived from Dubai. I don't know how to cook so I've been messing it up. Oh, sorry, sorry. Jessie, Chef is calling you at the kitchen. Not in the mood? You bet. He and Patty fought. Where's the pork belly? It's almost four and we aren't even halfway through! We still have to do catering later! Here you go. What are you doing here? Let's talk about that later. But now, I'll be your assistant. But... Stop acting up. Jessie, give that to me. Okay. Go! Thanks again. Don't mention it. So can you look at this now? There's no need for that anymore. Why? Patty asked me to move with her to New York. So what will happen to this and the other one you're building? I didn't agree. Sorry. I'm hungry- Is it good? Tastes like something I missed. Are you going to the homecoming later? Dean Dimalanta is waiting for me. Let's go together. Okay. Hey Beb, are you okay? - I'm hungry. - There's a lot of food here. Ginny! I just hitched with Beb. Hi, Wella. - Beb... - I'm going to eat. - Chef! - Sir Marco is here! Marco! Ginny! Lala! - Marco! - What's up? Wella and I have been waiting for you. How are you? So the rumor isn't true that you guys broke up? Did you end up together? What? - Of course not! - Wait. Babe, come here! Come! I'll introduce you to some people. Come on! This is my husband Steve. Hi. Nice to meet you. Marco. Genina Gonzales! Dean! Excuse me. Just the person I'm looking for. Dean! - Hello, Marco. - Sir. Finally, she's here. Hi! Hey! Hi! Good evening. Dean, tell Ginny now! I have good news for you. The university board wants to use your design... for the future new building of the College of Architecture. What? Your winning design. Do you still remember? Is this a joke, Dean? No! We're just waiting for you to agree. And as soon as you say yes, the project is a go. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I hope I can hear from you, Architect Gonzales. - Thank you. Thank you, Dean. - Congratulations, dear. They just fought. They didn't break up. No. No, Wella. This is different. This is serious. Come on, you're addicted to hope again. Why don't you try facing reality instead? No, Wella. In reality, isn't Patty the only problem between me and Marco? Now isn't she the one who started the problem? Can't you see, Wella? Even the universe is finding ways for me and Marco to have a second chance. This is it. I can feel it. Yeah! I'm good to go. You're riding with Beb, right? Yes... Bye, Marco. Bye, Wella. You have an early flight tomorrow. Have a safe flight. Don't forget your medicine. You're sick? No, no. Wella was just being her crazy self. So... College of Architecture Building! Wow. Your dream is coming true. It's just going to take up most of my time. What? You won't accept it? Imagine... A building in the university. You're now in the same league as the national artists. That's history. These things don't need too much thinking. You should say yes. I should say yes. Yes. But you need someone who will help you in your new restaurant. I auditioned earlier, right? What if... what if I said yes to you before? Maybe we're so happy right now. Marco, there are three words I've been wanting to say to you for five years now. I am sorry. I'm sorry because I didn't tell you the truth. I'm sorry that I left you. I'm sorry that I hurt you. I'm sorry because I was scared. And sorry for giving up on us. I'm sorry, too. Because I didn't see your fears. And your needs. Marco, what if... I'm ready for that life you've always wanted? I'm ready, Marco. I'm ready for you. You know the solution to your problem? Decision. I know it's hard. Because if you compare them, one will always be better... one will always be lacking. But if you're going to delay your decision... you're making it even harder for yourself. Besides, it's unfair to the two women. I already have a decision. I already know who. Ginny was right. There's a reason why we had to meet again. Give my gifts to them. Just kiss my godson for me. I'm here. Okay, We- Ginny! We're going to eat. Want to join? No, I'm okay. I'm still full. Sure? I'll take care of this. Okay. Let's go. - I'm really growing old. I'm sorry Patty. - It's okay Manang. Then the vendors and I had a chitchat... You're really one of a kind, Manang Suping. Fm going to leave now. Okay, don? forget my chorizo. Be safe, Manang. Hi, Ginny! Have you eaten? Do you want me to prepare something for you? No, it's okay. I thought you're in Bacolod? Yes, actually, I just got back this morning. You've seen Marco? Not yet. Actually, I wanted to surprise him because it's our anniversary. Oh... Sorry... It's boiling. I'll just lessen the fire. You know, Ginny... I just remembered that Marco once told me that you also like to cook. I'm sure you'll also enjoy baking. Oh, I might get bored. The measurements there have to be exact, right? Oh yes. Baking is like that. Unlike cooking, you can still add salt, or sugar, or acidity... if you still haven't achieved your desired taste. But with baking, you have to be certain. Because if you put too much of something... it can change the taste... the consistency... even the texture of the cake. So when you put it in the oven, that's it. Is that Central Park? Yes! That's where we met. Fall of 2011 . You know, some people say that it's the saddest season. But for me, I think it's just nature's way of teaching us to let go of old things... so that we can bring life to something new. That's why ifs my favorite season. And Marco? Marco is my autumn. How sure are you that your cake will convince Marco to move to New York? Did he tell you that? He must really believe me then. So it's not true? No. I would never make him do anything that he doesn't want to do. So why did you tell him that? Because I needed to keep him away from me, so I can prepare this. Patty, how sure are you that Marco wants to be with you. I'm sorry, Ginny. What did you say? Ginny? Because you said in baking... you have to be committed... You have to be sure of your next step... How sure are you with Marco? I don't mean to offend you. I hope you don't mind. I'm just being realistic here. In fact, if you think about it... I may be helping the two of you if you're not really sure about each other. Are you okay, Ginny? You need to face the truth, Patty. It's just logic. If there's even a slightest ounce of doubt in you, shouldn't you let him go? Let him be with the woman he loves and wants. Just think, Patty. If you end it now... you can actually save both of you from having a miserable future. Are you sick, Ginny? Come on, Patty! Don't patronize me! Stop being nice! We both know we can't be nice to each other! - And why is that-- - Because I am his ex! I am the love of his life. I am his past. I own a big part of him that you will never ever get. So what, Patty? Are you just going to leave it like this? Do you know that one of the reasons why men commit adultery... is because they just choose to settle? Is that what you want? Don't tell me that you were never threatened by me, Patty. You were never jealous of me? What if you were just a rebound? Patty, I loved him first. And you let go of your chance. But I still love him! And he still loves me. So please, Patty. Just let him go. Just set him free. Please. Shouldn't he be the one telling me that? Oh come on, Patty! We both know Marco! We know he's not capable of hurting anyone intentionally. Okay. So how sure are you that he loves you more? Because I saw it in his eyes. I felt it when he touched me... When he held me... I felt it when he kissed me... Slowly... Passionately... A kiss that pierces through your soul... A kiss that tells you he likes it too. Do you mean--. Yes, Patty. More than what you think I mean. Your life must be so sad. You know, Ginny... Marco and I... We don't have that... big romantic... kind of love story. In fact... Ours began in the most unexciting way. As friends. Now... Our love may be quiet... and boring... but it's sure. With the right amount of... respect... and trust... And even an allowance for mistakes. I love him, Ginny. And in love... there is no fear. I hope one day, you'll be able to find that kind of love. I'm sorry, Patty. I'm sorry, Patty. Patty, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Patty. Patty, I'm sorry. After this, you can go home. I'll just text you what we'll need. Okay. Ask the foreman to go back to the site. okay- Are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Love, I'm sorry. Love, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, love. My love is greater than your failures, Marco. But don't play with my feelings. Be fair. Be straight with me. Because I can accept whatever your choice will be. If you choose me... then it's me. If you choose her... then it's her. But you have to make a choice. Uncle Ben. How are you? I'm okay. I'll be outside. How is she? She's okay. I'm really sorry. Do you still remember this? That's where it all started, right? Are you going to reject me now? I've had enough rejections in my lifetime. You know... I loved you so much. So when you left me... It was so painful. It was so sad. I can still remember... I would force myself to sleep just so I wouldn't feel the pain. And everytime I wake up... I don't want to open my eyes because I know... it's going to be another day of unbearable pain. When... I wrote that email... I meant every word. I was willing to wait, Ginny. I stopped myself from following you in Barcelona... because that's what you asked for. But I got tired. My heart got tired of waiting... of asking... of getting angry. So when my grandmother died, I said... Grandma, take this. Take all the pain and anger in my heart with you. You won't believe this... but the pain really went away. I became numb. And that was how I was able to move on. And when I met Patty... that's howl picked myself up. So when... When Ali hired you, I said yes right away... because I was so sure that I can handle it. I was surprised when... I started feeling that I couldn't. It's like everything came back. The pain... The anger... And my love for you. The more I stop myself, the more I avoid you... the more it grows. But Patty is already here. I hope... I hope I can tell you that it will still be us... that nothing has changed. Bu! we're no longer the same people, Ginny. Every time I think of you... I think of Patty. Every time I feel something for you... what I feel for her follows. It was so confusing. So if... I did something wrong... I'm sorry. So what's the clincher? Every time I imagine... that Patty will be gone in my life... I feel like I'm going to die the second time. That's when I knew that I really love her. And I can't imagine another day without her. So now... Now I understand... why we had to meet again... why all of this had to happen. Closure. So we can be whole again. So... we can give the people we love, the love that they deserve. Patty deserves you. I hope she'll be able to forgive me. You, Marco? Have you forgiven me? Now, yes. How can I not forgive the person who pushed me... to become a better version of myself? Thank you. You're welcome. Now it's your turn to help me. Tell me... How do I unlove you? I don't know. Honestly, I don't. Because for me... I can never unlove you, Ginny. I just love you in a different way now. You'll be okay. That is probably the best gift Marco gave you. An ending? A chance for you to start again, without any questions left in your heart and mind. Not everyone gets that. This one, you remember this? Your gift on my birthday? Don't be like me. I wasted that. Time. Enough time for you to forgive yourself. Time to grow up, too. And that's the best gift you can ever give yourself. You're a mommy now! I know! I'm a daddy now! Hi baby! I'm your godmother! Hi baby! I love my baby! Okay! Okay! Cheers! Cheers! I'm going to be a godmother! Ginny. To a new life! To new beginnings! And happy endings! Cheers! Cheers! Will you marry me? Yes. Yeah! Kiss! Finally! She's mine! Beb! I'm on my way there! But wait! I got a flat tire! Wait, I'm just going to pull over. I'll take a cab. I'm going there. Taxi! Wait! You know... Next time... Wear a red lipstick. So fab for you! Bye, sis! Where is your partner? She's coming. She took a cab. Cab? Or a horse-drawn carriage? Hi! Thank God. Finally, she's here! The late Ginny Gonzales! That doesn't sound right, Dean! Sorry... Sorry... Sorry. I'm so sorry. That's okay. I'd like you to meet Engr. Ariza. Raffy Ariza. Hi. Fm really sorry... It's okay. Actually, there are two of us working with you guys... But... Hey! He's here! Architect Gonzales, I would like you to meet... Engr. Martin Coiuangco. I'm really sorry. I'm late. It's okay. The timing is just... perfect.
