My Dad totally has that. Hey. - Hey. - Glad you came. I'm... I don't mean to be rude but... what is this?.. I will explain... Because the sign on the door says 'Geography club'... - I know.... - And I don't see any maps... - Russell? I knew it. - Hey... - He knew what? - This is not a geography club. - That's obvious. - Oh... We are a group... - Like a band?.. - Like a secret support group. For what? For gay teens. You have no right. - Russell, stop. - Why do you do that? - Russell, just listen... - No. - I treat me and now they know that I'm... - Gay? I don't know... ok?.. I don't know what I am... ...and it's not your business anyway. You're right. And whatever you decide to do I would not say anything. About either of you. You do know it just because you saw what happened. It doesn't mean you get to say. I'm really sorry, Russell. But, please, just come inside, check it out... You stay out of my shit, alright? - It was nothing. - Yeah? She just wanted to say that we've got nothing to worry about. - For real? - Does it matter? You're right... You're right! Ah... Dude, I was almost hallucinating. That day at the park... Was that you? 'Cause it just... some coincidence? No, I... I recognized you from school. - I was gonna say something... you know... I just a... - Freaked down. - Exactly. - And then you made me feel like a complete idiot. Ok, then. Russell... you know... I'm sorry. I am. I'm just... Wait a second! Wait... Wait a second. What's this? I want to hang out with you. In school and stuff. Ok. But I don't... but I don't want people gain suspicious. You know, like, "What are they doing together outside?", you know. - So... you got me a jersey? - No. I got you joined team. - Good morning. - Morning. So I thought to ride to school together today. Ah... cool. Ah... what's that? - Ah... That is Florence Carsi. - Ah... You named it Flo? Yeah, after my grandmother Florence. So lame. It's not lame! Air is crisp, my friend! Crisp. Why are you so happy this morning? No, nothing. You know, just Kimberly said she goin' on date with me. So what made you to finally change her mind? No, no. It's just she came out with her senses. It's awesome, man! Oh, and... Kimberly also said that I ought to come along with her friend Trish or canceling it. - No way! - Oh, come on, Russell! I do not wanna to do that! Why? Because she wears a promise ring? Who cares? Trish is hot! I don't care! The answer is 'No'. - What the hell are you doing? - Russell... You have to do this for me. - Friend, it's all that ever matters! - Well, I do not wanna... Please... Please, I'm begging you as a friend! If I go on date with Kimberly... For the first time in my life I will have a girlfriend. How, do you know, important is that for me? Ok. - Oh, dude, thank you very much! - No problem. Thank you so much! Feeling dizzy, itching crazy, having ceases... ...feeling lazy, cold and clammy skin... - Oxicom! - Yeah! - Hey, how was the test? - Know that, babe. What are these? They are my Mom's pills in replace with other medicines. Those are just the empty bottles. - She's going freak. - I know. Hi. - I just wanna observe. - Ok. I don't wanna say anything. Noway and anyways. It's cool. Whatever it makes you feel comfortable. Therese sing was a side effects on the fill bottles... ...and she try to guess that drug is based on the effects. Cool. The vomiting looks like coffee grains... ...sweating and weakening all around... Nausea, chest pains breaking bloody stools... Ciprocin, my grandmother takes that. Too cool, sexy. Ok, girl. Your braids are in dying need of... No. She looks beautiful. Stop. Ok, so... let's a buzz set. Feel I aged Arina last night good? So my Mom finds me in my room... and tells me she's gonna give me $100. Nice! But says I'm only allowed to buy a dress with it. That girl as pretty as me shouldn't be wearing jeans all the time. Ok, or maybe she's just trying to be nice? Or maybe she's just trying to be a bitch. - Do you think that's bad? Listen to this. - What?... Ah... - Upsi... Yeah... - Upsi... So, after weeks of talking this boy online, we finally met up. Hmm. So what I think: let's see how far I can take this. Then I'm all. I mean to put my hands down his pants and see what happens. - And here's a surprise! - Big package? - Try no package. - What? - He was totally a 'she'. - Look, ok... I don't get it. He's this girl. Her name is Samanta. She is a les. When she told her parents, they hit the road. She came back a day later and told them that she was just confused... ...and approved to them she'd go out and promised to find a boyfriend. I know, tragic, right? She said she did not want a straight dude... ...said she felt safe with a gay guy instead. I mean, I did tell her that I was 80-20, but she didn't mind. 80-20? 80% straight, 20% gay. - Ok. - So what happened? We went and got coffee. Talked for hours. Beach is fierce. So I'm gonna be her fake boyfriend until she figures it's just a wish now. - It's awesome, dude! - It's really cool. Well, I have an exam which to prepare. - Ah... I can help a little. - Thanks. Hey... I'm... just curious. What made you decide to come back? I don't know... You're like not telling anyone, are you? You know about us, too. It's tideous. 5 minutes late! - Hi, Russell. - Hi, Trish. I bet you are great at bowling. I'm ok. Yeah! Thought that we gained cheese? - They ran out of cheese... So... - That's ok, Gunnar. It is? Well, I can go and... slice a pizza that's got cheese on it. No, no, forget it! I'm not even... hungry... anymore... - They're actually pretty good. - Give me. Oh... oh, so... delicious. - I love the burn. - Apple tea? - Ah-ha... Pure vodka. - Hot. - That's a while and I gain a car. - When? Well... it's not official... but... my birthday's coming up... ...and I told my Daddy he should give me a car... so... here you are. I mean, you'd better. It's my 17-th birthday. I think I've earned that. - Don't you think I've earned it? - I think I'm totally on you. Oh... I know... Alright... - Am I paraphrasing? - Totally. Ah... Is that a good thing?.. Do you take me to Tommy? Do you know what I mean, do you? Kinda. Excuse me, I'm going to girls room. - Dude, she's perfect. - Yeah, totally... - Ah... Can we borrow your car? - Yeah, yeah. You can...

I don't know. That's such out of question. - If you had to choose... - "The Case of Door Mansion"! Where everyday play detectives and resolve every crime by dinner time. What about you? - "Dirty Harry." - Sounds great. I love "dirty". - I can hear your heart beating. - You can? You're nervous, I can tell. - What? - Relax. Ah... I'm confused... Ah, that... That was a promise ring. Ups... What happens in Vegas... We are not even in Vegas... Bullshit! - Who are that? - The homeless dude. - Let him watch. - What? - What's wrong? - I don't know... Ah... Nothing, I just... - I do not think that we should... - What? - You know. - Why not? Well... ah... we don't have any condoms... so... Well, I didn't say I want to have sex with you, no deny? Ah... But if you do want, I have one in my purse. - No, I can't. - You can't? Right. Oh, like you can't erect up? - What? No! - I'm confused. Ah... I'm just a... I'm... I'm a virgin. So I... I wanna my first time to be special. You're great, but... you... just don't... feel right... I mean... by me it doesn't feel right. You are... You are perfectly fine. I get it. I wanna my first time to be special too. Russell Middlebrook, you're a romantic. What am I doing? So it's what happen. I'm standing there and thinking, "What the hell am I doing here?" You know, I've tryed play football before, but this is a whole other thing. Coach, is he likes what he seeing. He's gonna take a chance. He's gonna start me. - Say why. - I know, right? So the game starts. I'm freaking out. Oh, you ready? I can not believe you grabbed me on the team. Well, you gonna be the best player I know. - Come on! - That's where I got confused. I thought that Kevin got me on the team so just he can make me excuse to hangout... Anything... that's part of it, but... ...at that moment... I realized I actually thought like a player. He believed in me as a football player. And... I don't know why... but it got me pumped. Anyways, before I knew it we were in fourth quart... ...and... at this point I'm feeling it... should I... I'm desperate away. And just why I thought about the game in the bag. They scored. We needed a touchdown to win. And we hadn't any time in fact, we only had one thing left. Middlebrook, you think you do it? I can do it. Good. All I wanna a won, ready? We won. - Well done! - I was saying it! I know, I know... I was going crazy... and everyone was cheering for me and... ...I just keeped to thinking, this night can not be getting better. But I was wrong... It did. - That was incredible. - Thanks. You made it, Russell. School football thing is bringing us closer. I mean... Sometimes you can be such an ass... like... ...sort of thing... I'm coming over him... but... ...it all gets sweet and... I might arose before. I'd like to join the Geography club. - Dude! - Hey, guys. Well done, bro! Seriously, I can't believe you brought it up. - Thanks. - Madness skills for real. Come on, the game was days ago. - Besides, a team effort... - Not that. Dude, Trish. Yeah, we heard you nailed her. - Who told you that? - No embarrassment. How's whore going to be?.. - She's not a whore. - What a shit? Can just degrade another kids female like that! It's not cool. Sorry, man. She's not a whore. I am. - Thanks. - Middlebrook? - Hey. - Everybody in town is talking you about it. - Everyone knows? - They were there. - What? - The game. - Right, yeah. - What else, mate? All of them will never forget a play like that. - Yeah, of course. - Not even my parents. - They wanna meet the new star. - Yeah? Dinner at my place on Friday night, you alright? Kev's mom's a doc cook... I mean room is place as a kitchen, am I right? - You're retarded. - What? Yes, sounds good. Come in. Cool. And at the end you buy a cake, right? Kevin was only in 3 at the time... Oh, no, wait, he was 4. Oh, wait, no, no, he was 3, right? Anyway, the pressure point is that he never would have noticed... that it was overflowered - it is birthday cake, - but the guests certainly would have. The party is only as good as its host... ...and the host is only as good as your cake. Yeah, I've entirely did it. Nobody likes a stale treat. That's what happens... We use too much flowers and kids are all tough. But they're not that. Oh, that's why I use mixers now. I make room for it. That's the truth. Baking from scratch... It's just not worth it. - I agree. - Hey, have some more. Oh, thank you. - Russell. - Yes, sir. Where you've been hiding, son? Ah... Excuse me? Where you've been hiding?.. All these years... I'd never seen you at any football team before. I've not been hiding... I've just didn't think I could do it. He didn't think he could do it. We got a nickname for you, son. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Flash. - Flash? After that Flash, comin' to famous for its running. Well... that's... that's really cool nickname. - Kevin told it me. - You did? - Hmm. - Hey, Flash? - Yes, sir? I like you, son. Thank you, sir. Hey, maybe you should come to church with us this weekend. Meet the whole family. What do you mean 'the whole family'? Your uncle Glenn comes to the town. - Yeah? - Yeah. He's introducing us to his new boyfriend, Eddie... Your uncle says he may be the one. Says he's be sure for the actually. - So you coming, Flash? - Ah... yeah... yes, sir. I'd love to go. Well, fella boy. - Why is he doing this? - Doing what? You cause it overreactive. If Brian comes back to you, what's one we can not join. No club is allowed to turn anyone away. We are obliged to take him. Thought noone wanted to join. So why you guys named it Geography club? Know, we chose it because it's boring. We didn't think anyone actually come. Anyways, I don't see why you guys are so scared of... ...and maybe we should open this club... or... make it known. - No, no way! - Why not? I do not want the whole school know about me. For real, I already got messed up with 170% straight. We got to be ourselfs here. Should we mind other kids looking of the same thing? Oh, shit. I don't really care about the Geography. I already have a 10 in Geography so... ...thought about joining this club for a while just to make friends but... ...I was scared. Little people laugh of me, I'm not stupid. Thing is... I don't wanna go home after school. I'm scared of it, actually. So I play the cello... I play it when I'm nervous. It's what I do all night... playing the cello. When I'm nervous, little much my fingers twist. Oh... I just don't wanna go home after school also... ...nor I can force you be my friend or... so... Don't worry about your secret. I'm not gonna tell anybody. So be honest... do you think I'm a good football player, do you? Yeah, absolutely. Wait... do you think maybe one day I can win the Heimen? - Whats? - It's called the Husman, you shit tard. - Shut it, alright? - Hey. - Hey. - Have you seen Ike? He left his phone in my car. - Ah... No. - Oh... Ok. - Sorry. - Are you coming today? I don't know. Maybe... See you later. Let me guess. One drunken night and suddenly she thinks you two are dating. - Exactly. - Ah-ha... What a thing... Now be careful 'cause it's all muddy. - Would you just relax? - Be a magic. - Why just paint it black? - Stay... Stay still. - I'm not moving. - Stay still! - Hey, did you guys read this? - The school newspaper?.. Eu... Ah... Eeverybody is reading today. Mrs.Toles gave a controversial interview. - The health teacher? - Yeah. - What did she say? It talked about feelings and sex education and how she was for a condom machine in school bathrooms. It also talked about the time she put condoms on cucumbers in class. Today we can be working with wide variety of vegetables. We got 2 cucumbers and of cause we have squash and cukini. They now appear to represent the genetically unlucky. It's well as those in probably other areas. It would bring about ravishes to put in the background. But listen to this... Wait... where is Russell? - He's not answering his phone. - What an ass... Ah... anyway. "No one student complained to me about my condom exercises," said Mrs. Toles. "In fact three students came up to thank me." So what is this have to do with us? "As a health educator, it's my job to teach all the students," Toles said. According to Toles, that even includes gay students. "There are gay and lesbian students at every high school in the town, including ours." "Just last week I talked to one of them about support group for gay teens." "The world is changing every day and I think it's a phenomenal idea to estate it." "When the school board found that she gave this interview, Mrs. Toles was... suspended." Now I'm guessing not an interview would have gonna up to Ms. Toles to suggest a gay support group. Guys, there are others like us at this school and they're looking a place to go. I'm not ready to be an outcast. For real, there is no acceptance for a 50-50 guy in this school. You're whether being so selfish very now? I mean, I never know I can date girl who only cares about yourself. Ba... I can't believe you just burried that. Gently... grab the ankles of the child with one hand... and raise its both... out of the diaper. - Dude, this is retarded. - Just do it. - Why me? - Because you're the Mom. - I am the Mom? - Yeah... - And that so... means you are the Dad? - Exactly. - Oh... How am I end up the Mom? - Ah... 'cause your man boobs, Gunnar... - An obvious. - You're such an asshole. Ok... let us see... take a... take a wipe and clean with the baby's oil. - Hey, not be cool? - What's that? Kimberly's parents have this really cool lake house and... she thought it we would be totally cool if we gotta this weekend. Trish will be there too... so... won't it just be the coolest? Yeah... just... just keep the baby's bottom up while you wipe... - Russell, please. - ... near 3... 4... wipes... - You! - What's?... - Why don't you wanna go? - I just don't. - Trish is so hot and she's into you... Yeah, I know but... she's too cleany... and everyone at school thinks that we had sex. Yeah, I don't see what's wrong with that. I'm not going... so... whatever... Ah... as we used to take up dirty and put it on the bed... so... You know this is so unfair! Now on the one second we're best buds, and on the next-- you're Mr. Popular Football Guy.

Russell, don't screw this up for me. - Who's ready to start drinking? - Me! - Yes. - And do you like weights? I rather not be, because... I don't make like drinks bitches. - Hey, Trish? - Yeah. Isn't Mr. Donaldson like totally veinable? No, it's not. Oh, come on, he's such a lookable muffin. Muffin is a something you leak, Kimberly. Yeah. That's rude. My hands are cold. May I can have frozed by?... - Yes. - Shut up, dick. - Let us take some shots. - I love shots. I don't want one. - Seriously? - Can you make me something else?

Fag! Hey, you around? - Thanks for coming to keep me. - Of course. What's up, kid? I slug. What are you talking about? Everything...
