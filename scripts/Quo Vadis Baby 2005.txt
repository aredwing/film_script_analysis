Weather in Italy this weekend will be characterized by partly cloudy skies, intervals of sun and above average temperatures... "Dear Giorgia, it's been a while, I hope you are well. In this package there are video tapes that Ada sent me from Rome. I found them while moving for the millionth time. It's a miracle they weren't lost. I haven't seen them in a while, it's best if you keep them. Hugs, Aldo." She was in Rome for two years and only came to visit twice. Whenever I called she'd say she was busy, she never had time. I kept asking if I could visit her, but never... What should I do? Watch the tapes with a bowl of popcorn after 16 years? - Say something. - I can't, boss. That's the first rule I learned here, never mention your sister. Once I accidentally... It was a huge... It's the first time you've talked to me about her. Lattice. Alberto Lattice, in there... He seems edgy. What the fuck does this mean? Who are all these guys? You whore, one wasn't enough? How many are there? One, two, three... four, five! She had a basketball team? I'll show her, whore, hussy. Just like her mother, that slut! Yes? Sorry I didn't come to the meeting. I did everything for her. I worked like a horse, I even went into debt for furs, jewelry, a convertible! While I was scrounging up money she was "working out" in broad daylight. She should have been paid at least! Listen, signorina... I love her. Damn, I can't get divorced. I can't live without her. Now what do I do? Signor Lattice, I'll leave you to ponder it, here's the payment info. You're all alike. Money, that's all you talk about. You ruined me, you left me on the train tracks, you sent me to hell with a one-way ticket and now you want your money. - Hello? - Aldo, it's Giorgia. It's been ages! - I got the video tapes. - My battery's dying and I'm leaving. - I can't hear you. - My battery is dying. Why did you send them to me? - Hello? - It's dying. Is there something I need to see? Hello? Does she say why the fuck she killed herself? Too slutty? It'll be different in Rome. Giulio found us a great place. I can study acting, go to auditions. - Don't leave me, Ada. - We'll keep in touch. Giorgia, this is my dream. - Me, all alone with the Captain? - You get along with Dad. Look at me. Giorgia, look at me. You're the person I love most in this world. - I don't believe you. - It's true. - More than Giulio? - Of course. I live for you, little sister. What do you think? It's the best I could do. Who knows what they want? Hot babe, normal gal, worldly... This is my portfolio. Giulio's affectionate with me, overly. He's kind and protective, reminds me of my father. Rome's not so bad. This city's like a whore, it makes promises but gives nothing. But it's beautiful. you can walk on it, explore it, smell it... It puts you in a good mood. What more could you want from a whore? A director said I'm perfect for the part. I can't stand professional actors. Affected voices, relying on the memorized text. Remember It's The Singer, Not The Song by the Stones? The singer counts, not the song. I had an audition yesterday at Teatro Stabile. Over 300 actors for one part! I wanted to yell, "We are screwed. ladies!" We found out the part had already been handed out. it was all an act, just to get state funding. Giulio called the doctor two nights in a row. He shows up, gives me an injection, then I sleep soundly. Morning's a bitch though. But one morning at an audition I met A. I'd rather not tell you his name, he should remain an entity. We've been meeting for over a week. Giulio doesn't suspect a thing. Don't tell Giorgia... Hold on a second. It was her. Don't tell her, she likes Giulio, she thinks I'm living it up here. This affair with A won't last, he's eager to get his fill and run. We see lots of films together then we discuss them. His favorite is Last Tango in Paris, we know every line by heart. I like A's enthusiasm. He's writing a film, he's full of ideas. He lives life... like a child. sweet and reckless. You asked about A in your letter. I like when he grabs me without foreplay, my body feels free, my head detached from the rest. It's like dancing the tango. It's like... dancing the tango. Giulio was away for work yesterday. I waited all night for A. You know that film Querelle? With Jeanne Moreau? She says, "Why did you make me wait so long? Do you want to hurt me? My desire for you is so intense!" He says, "Why did you desire me? Do you know who you desired?" I need him, his enthusiasm, his dreams full of movies. I eat four oranges a day to buy a fringe-theatre ticket. The director says I can be Ophelia if I'm nice to him. The worst is going home to Giulio after having made love with A. I see the others. Who hid real time from me? My father said I won't go far with my personality. But I see pure cinema inside of me. I'll become it. Ada, wait for me! Mum! Let go of me! Good morning. Giorgia! Your dad's here, don't forget about my salary. Captain! Where is Commander Bonetti's file? Don't ask me, I never touch your things. - What happened to you? - I slept with a ghost. I don't care who you sleep with, come to work presentable. You need to sign some documents. Signor Cantini, I found Bonetti's file. Good. - Can I speak to you... - Later. When pain overwhelms you, your face withers, you want to hide before realizing nobody's looking at you any more. Sign, so I can file it. I want to ask you something. What did Ada look like before they sealed her coffin? You and auntie wouldn't let me see her, what did she look like? Was her hair shorter? Was she thinner? Anything else? Does Comolli have a stiff neck? Bitch! We basically ruin people's lives. They're in love and we... I don't care what happens after. I watch, take pictures, and collect the money. Hold on. It's Aldo, leave a message. Aldo, Giorgia again. It's impossible to talk to you... In the tapes Ada talks about a guy called "A". Does he really exist? Do you know anything? Bye, answer me! Fuck! Hello? Sure thing. I'm in the middle of a job... If it goes well... I'll buy the Joy Division box set. - Hi, Cantini. - Commissioner. - Is that Afghani hash? - Excuse me? Afghani, it's good. Smoking this early? Do what I do, a nice joint at bedtime. - Don't you agree? - It's still a drug. We found the body of Alberto Lattice's wife, seems he was your client. Do you think he did it? He was just here yesterday. I didn't even show him all the pictures. The motive is rather... What do you think? I spent the night with A, he was imitating Brando in Last Tango In Paris. - Bruni, can I ask you a favor? - Sure. I have a sister, Ada. I had a sister, she killed herself 16 years ago. - I didn't know, sorry. - I never announced it. Can you check if there's anything odd in her file? - Where did it happen? - Rome, May 14, 1988. I'll write it down. It won't be easy. - You think she didn't kill herself? - I'm not so sure. - What's her name? - Ada. We'll see... I'll keep this. - Thanks. - I'll let you know. My regards to the Captain. Nice, isn't he? Ada! Are you here? Are you here? Are you here? Mum! - Giorgia, did you call me? - No, auntie. Careful, it's dusty down there. Don't worry. Here is the candy Giorgia likes. This is for our little artist's drawings. Seems she was hanging out laundry on the terrace. She must have had a dizzy spell. Poor Cantini, what a tragedy. How are you, darlings? I'll always be with you, we'll pull through it. Mum will look after us from above. I say it'll be a cracking party. The cinema professor is pretty cool. He's got good music, good stuff. I've got exams next month, so I'll be all smiley... - What's up with you? - Nothing. I don't know who A is but I know he wanted to be a director. I shouldn't have sent you the tapes, Aldo The light that falls on a mirrored surface will have an angle that reflects the incident light which renders the visible corner very important. Perception is the sum of elementary sensations... - Professor. - Hello. - Remember me? - Yes. Congratulations, really... Can I ask you a few questions if you have time? Certainly. Andrea Berti, I'm responsible for this delirium. - You must be Lucio's friend. - Pleasure, Giorgia. He said I absolutely had to meet you but he didn't say why. You've got three minutes to figure it out. Not much time, where do I start? Anywhere, but hurry, time's ticking. You're serious! - What do you do for work? - Something nobody wants to do. - You pave highways? - Worse, I work with my father. Small investigation agency, I get paid to be nosy. Interesting, there are great films about lady investigators and some have personalities like yours. One more reason not to go to the movies. You don't like movies? Last film I saw was 20.000 Leagues Under The Sea. I was six. I've hated Bach, submarines, and squid ever since. You could give it another try with something more... Did you see 101 Dalmatians? I'm up, this is my least favorite moment. Come along. See you. I hope, I have a minute and a half left. Sometimes A scares me. I don't know who he really is. But when we're together it's like wearing an evening gown instead of the usual jeans. I bought a pregnancy test. You'd have to be insensitive to bring a baby into the world. I'm sure A sees other women. But I feel good with him. We drink, fuck, he always has some stuff. I know Giorgia complains because I never write but I'd have to tell her lies and I don't want to. Giulio's always away for work. He asks so many questions. Maybe he's suspicious. - I didn't know a thing. - Try to remember. Unbelievable, she had an affair! I didn't know anything. It's insane! This is all new to me. It hurts me, Giorgia. Did she say she used coke? - She said she wasn't happy. - She wasn't happy? That was 16 years ago. We're physically different. We move and think differently. That was another life time and luckily it's over, period. Bye, Giulio. You really are a bitch! You showed me tapes of my woman... - My sister! - My woman! Saying she fucked another man, she thought she was pregnant. What am I supposed to do? Ada killed herself. It took me so long to... Does she ever mention Anna? Anna and I are going to a Zeffirelli audition. Who is Anna? A friend, an aspiring actress. They were inseparable toward the end. What did they do? We should just let the past be. I didn't get her pregnant, we hadn't touched each other in five months. - Hi, Cantini. - Hello, Commissioner. I'm calling about that favor you asked, your sister's file. There is an anomaly. There's no autopsy report attached. Don't jump to any conclusions. The cop who did the investigation had no doubt she killed herself. I'll read it... There are a few secondary testimonies, a neighbor who heard fighting, another who heard doors slamming. There must have been some action that night. That's it. Thank you. Any news on Lattice? I think he's following me, as long as he keeps his distance... Don't push him, he's dangerous. Call me if you need anything. At any time. Thanks, bye. Signora Cantini. They asked me if I knew my wife's lovers. Did you do it? Why do people change? Why did my wife suddenly become a stranger to me? Ada, get away from the window! Are you nuts? He's watching us. Get away from there. Lattice, fuck you! - I don't want to hear your whining! - Right. Geez, this someone must be pretty clingy! - Who is this? - Andrea Berti. Hope I'm not bothering you. No, not at all... No problem. I'll get to the point, dinner tomorrow night? You know, sit around a table. Order food, eat, and nothing more. Tomorrow night? Like tonight but in 24 hours. Why did I accept? Why? Let me see. Why did I accept? You've become a bore! Girls, go in the other room. Nice job, Cantini. - Making some progress. - Commissioner. - Come to warm up your muscles? - Nope. To use the sauna and to give you good news. I could use some. Lattice turned himself in this morning. He killed his wife. Now you can rest easy. He was at my door last night. He told me. You should have called me. He says it's your fault. You shouldn't have shown him the photos. Crazy! He won't bug you any more. What are you doing tonight? Life is strange. out of a can with my cat and tonight everyone wants to ask me to dinner. I'll mark it on my calendar. You underestimate yourself. Some other time then, take care. - Quo vadis, baby? - You scared me stiff! Sorry, I parked far away. Been waiting long? Can we have some red wine? - Would you like to see the menu? - No, I need some right away. The house wine will do. A Cabernet. - They have great raw fish. - Raw? - The vegetables are good too. - I don't eat them. - No vegetables. - No fruit either. No potatoes or tomatoes? - Peaches, apricots, apples... - The texture grosses me out. I don't want to pry but what do you eat? Lots of pudding, cream cheese, alternated with cottage cheese, plain pasta, tortellini soup, a ton of nicotine. - Lots of childhood traumas? - Why? You don't like the best things in life, movies and food. But I like to drink. The other glass is for... Same difference. Ready to order? It won't be easy. Great chocolate pudding. See, there's always something good to eat. Why don't you have a girlfriend? Can I ask you that first? With older men I don't know what to talk about, with younger men I do, but they can't fuck. - Never mind 40-year-olds. - Do tell, I'm interested. They're adolescents trapped in ageing bodies. Every birthday is a crisis, they console themselves with big cars. The portrait of me. And I don't even have a car. You didn't answer my question. Things happen to you in life that... - Is that an answer? - No. My female students like me a lot but I only like women who are my age. Will you give me a ride home? I'm not trying to hit on you. I'LL CALL YOU KISSES, GIORGIA This is all I can do. Say bye to him for me. Here's the return ticket, this is the hotel. I don't know how to explain it, Dad, acting's like tight-rope walking, people watch but don't have the guts to do what you do. It's fantastic, you feel their eyes on you and their support. They want you to walk up high. - You know? - Put on your seatbelt, honey. Andrea Berti's answering machine, leave a message. - You're just like I pictured you. - What do you mean? Your sister spoke of you often, she showed me a photo. Odd. Not a single letter during her two years in Rome. She didn't want to lie to you, or tell you the truth. Meaning? She wasn't happy, she couldn't find work, things were bad with Giulio. - Do you know who A is? - No. She wouldn't tell me, it hurt me because your sister and I told each other everything, we had a deep relationship. We weren't just friends, get it? I'm not so sure. I loved your sister and I think she cared for me, too. Come in. Honey, did you have a good time? A killer time. This is my son, Gabriele. I was in Florence for a class, I never forgave myself. Absence is always the cause of everything. See this? It was hers. Gabriele, where are you going? I asked if I could keep some of her things. Your dad said to throw everything away. After the investigation, I was able to take some of her things but I had to get authorization. Do you know the Italian state considers suicide a crime? And you? You have nothing of Ada's? This was hers, too. I don't believe she killed herself over work. I'm sure she thought long and hard about it. It wasn't the act of someone who lost control. It was something she had inside for a while. Like she was running from something. I'd like to see her again. I don't think there's a place where the dead go, but I do think they watch us as we live. They observe us, laugh at us, at our crises, and the fact that we cry for them. Maybe years from now, when I'm not as pretty as today... Don't laugh, Christine. When Thorwald no longer considers me, or enjoys me dressing up for him, dancing for him, declaiming... Don't laugh, Christine. When Thorwald no longer considers me... I'm Cantini, a surveyor, there's a water leak, may I take a look? Go ahead. We have to get ready, we're late. I'll be quick. What time is the audition? What I like about this house is Giulio pays the rent. I'll show you around. This is the bathroom. It's small, but has everything. I'd like to make some minor changes, colored curtains, a comfy sofa... I won't show you the bedroom, it's a disaster area. This is where I'll be living. Probably not for long... - It won't collapse, right? - Don't worry, it's solid. - Boss! - Hi, Lucio. - Are you at home? - Almost. - Everything OK? - More or less. Professor Berti's bombarding me with questions about you. What should I do? - You struck him. - I don't want to strike anyone. Hold on! You devil! See you at work tomorrow? See you, boss! Bye. My father said I won't go far with my personality. Is there a limit to all this? I need to leave this house, it's full of ghosts. They're all around me, watching me. It's hard to admit it, but they're right. I'm just one of the many, a beggar, I need air. What the fuck are you doing here? - Why didn't you tell me? - I thought they'd upset you. - How long have you had them? - A few days. - Who sent them to you? - The guy Ada sent them to. Why did you go to Rome? Is this an interrogation? I went to see Ada's house, to meet her friends. I want to know why she killed herself. Good. Be careful, you can't play with the past, especially if it's not only yours. Sorry, I didn't want you to see them. Well, I saw them all, from beginning to end. I thought I'd live my last years serenely, but pain always seems to find its way back home. Do you know Mum had a boyfriend? He was sitting there, all hunched over. I just realized he's grown old, he's no longer the Captain. I felt sorry for him. He's right, so much time has gone by, where will I find A? If he actually exists. It's time for me to let go, and think about myself. A Chinese proverb says: "A flower only sprouts if the seed is buried." Do you like Chinese food? You don't call, you just show up. I guess you preferred pizza. Chinese is perfect. - I'm not used to this. - Is that a compliment? - Maybe I'm deluding myself. - Why? This is real. We're here, we know each other... It feels like something normal. It is. Normality is not all that bad. It's nice. - Want some? - I can't. Let's forget about doubts and fears tonight... It's snowing. What are you thinking about? they say she killed herself. They say? - Do you believe in God? - Let's say I admire him. When you lose a loved one, you believe in the afterlife. Which doesn't exist. This is it, with a precise expiration date that we don't know. We're worse off than the clones in Blade Runner. I read your book, professor. I didn't really get it. Maybe we can read it together, you can explain it. JUST LIGHT THE FIRE BE BACK SOON LAST TANGO IN PARIS Try to remember, the man from the fourth floor! He hasn't lived here long. I don't know the neighbors. They come and go, the one from the fourth floor, from the first. I don't know. Forgive me, I don't know why you did it. I'd do it too, if I knew why you did it, but I don't understand. I don't know. You're all alone, you won't rid yourself of this loneliness until you see the face of death. Not even. This is just romantic bullshit. I'll never come back. You'll never see me again. Quo vadis, baby? I forgot to tell you something. We drink, fuck, he always has some stuff. Want some? Sometimes A scares me. I don't know who he really is. But when we're together it's like wearing an evening gown instead of the usual jeans. He said I absolutely had to meet you. He drinks too much. - Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't know who you were. - But then you figured it out. - And it became harder to tell you. I tried to avoid you but you dropped by yesterday... I just wanted to be with you. You were there that night. What the fuck happened? Don't touch me, you make me sick! Let go of me! I know you were there. We had whisky and plenty of stuff. Giulio was away for work. It was the first summery night and we went overboard. But that was normal for us, we were used to it. We made love and watched a film. Then we started fighting. For no reason, we just wanted to massacre each other. The only way out was for me to leave, so I did. I walked around, I was out for an hour and then I went back to Ada's. I rang the bell, but nobody answered. So I pushed open the door, it was open. I stepped on something on the floor. I picked it up and when I looked up, I saw her. I opened and closed my eyes, it was a nightmare. I just wanted to leave. I grabbed my stuff and left. I was with Ada for six months, but I wasn't her boyfriend. We liked each other, we dreamt of cinema, but we were anxious to live too fast, all extraordinary. Maybe this is why I never understood your sister. - She just wanted to be an actress. - She wanted you, too. No, she was willing to sleep with directors, producers... But you were there that night and you left. If I were in that same situation today... What would you do? - Wait. - Fuck you! I'm distant, detached, I look at myself... Sometimes I even fake it. Making love is like going out to sea with someone, but then I want to go back alone. You know what? It's time you invited me to dinner. You cook. It's nobody's fault. For Berti, my sister was one of the many who puts out to get famous. - Have you ever been in love? - Yes, once. But after an intense weekend I found out this person was getting married. You guys love women who screw you over. His name was Mario, he was an engineer. I like men. - Are you kidding? - You never noticed? You live side by side with a person but you don't really know them. Do you really think Ada minds that you met her Andrea Berti? He's not the same, he's Andrea Berti 20 years later... That's a superficial analysis. You're full of rage, don't you see? You can't stand that this guy, who played artist, saw your sister swaying. - She wasn't a swing. - Let me finish! Then use other words. I'm saying it's hard, but they were both out of it. - Ada was out of control... - He didn't stop her. - Whose side are you on? - Yours. - You can't punish a person... - Women and elephants never forgive. I don't know about women but you seem to always need an enemy. - First your father... - Leave him out of it. He's the one who suffers most in the situation. Don't you see how he suffers, how he drinks? Give me a break. Know what the problem is? You act like you're all you need. That's what you want people to think. Who says we need to be strong? Where is it written? - Commissioner. - Hi, Cantini. Well? It's a little early for a dinner invite. I called you because I wanted to tell you something kind of private. Go ahead, Mel's like a brother. - Beer? - Thanks. - I don't know where to begin. - Anywhere. It's about your sister. We found the autopsy report, I won't tell you how or where... And? The report shows your sister had a wild life. I know, go on. Your sister was pregnant. The report shows traces of coke and alcohol and she had bruises on her face and back. - Anything else? - No. - If I can... - Thanks. At least you say things like they are. The objective corresponds with the eye. You sicken me, you're full of shit. What the fuck do you want? We'll take a break. Come outside. - Come on. - Let go of me, asshole! You bullshitted me, you didn't tell me you hit her. Did you? I didn't hear it! - Can I help you? - I'm here for your class. Listen! - I didn't do it. - All I can say is you make me sick. - I swear! - Don't touch me. There was someone else that night. I didn't want to tell you, you may think I'm a coward, but I didn't touch your sister. Who was there? Who? - Your father. - I don't believe you. - Why didn't you tell me right away? - What was I meant to say? You really want to know what happened? Then talk to your father. By the way... Ada was pregnant. What a coincidence. The only one who could recognize me ends up in your arms. I saw you leave the restaurant with him. See, Giorgia... you dream of Ada at night, but I... I can't sleep, that's why I followed you. Why didn't you tell me you went to Ada's? I wanted to bring your sister home. I went to Rome, I walked around then got up the courage. I went to her place, she opened the door in a black slip with whisky in hand. Who the fuck are you? It's 2am. Your professor, I sent him away, then I looked at your sister... She laughed in my face. She was drunk, I told her to pack her stuff and come home. She fell. I didn't want to hurt her. She stared at me. I realized she hated me. I left, I left her alone. Maybe I wasn't a good father, but everything I did, I did for you two. Now I need you, your understanding. If you can... I need to be alone to think it over. I'll call you. - Who's it from? - Anna Loy from Rome. Cantini Agency. Good evening. She's right here. The package lady. I'll take it in the office. - Guess what it is? - I have no idea. It's the video camera Ada used to use. You don't have anything of hers so keep it. I wouldn't know what to do with it. It works, you can use it at work, but maybe it's too old. Inside the camera there's a tape, a film by Fritz Lang. I don't like movies. Too bad. Send it back to me, it's a great film. Actually, bring it back so we can see each other. I'll call you if I come to Rome. - Promise? - Yes. Kisses. ... if the bogeyman doesn't come, with his long knife... I said stop singing that damn nursery rhyme! How many times must I say it? 10.000 MARK REWARD WHO'S THE ASSASSIN? What a nice ball. What's your name? Elsie Beckmann. Special edition. The monster of Dsseldorf's new victim. Girl found dead in the park. CONTINUE SEARCHING SOON YOU'LL FIND THE PROOF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR I'm peeling an onion... prompt me. You're an onion, dear Peer Gynt, and I'll peel you. So many layers, when will I get to the heart? No way, dear God. Before reaching the heart there are lots of thin layers. Nature is toying with us. How was that? - Who's the assassin? - He killed another girl. - The police must act now. - No more posters. You're right, time to act. Each day the investigation expands. People no longer recall certain details which could give us a lead. - He's walking with her. - Run after him. Why? The day little Elsie Beckmann was killed, a man bought a toy from me. He had a girl with him. - Do you like oranges? - Yes. Careful, don't throw the peels on the ground. It's Bruni, how are you doing? Surviving, thanks for the call. - Am I interrupting? - No. I was wondering if I could... invite you to dinner again. - Now? - I know, it's late... I just got off now. - Some other time then. - I have nothing to eat at home. Come and pick me up? Actually I'm at your door, I walked. Give me two minutes. This man must be eliminated like a dangerous cancer. He must be exterminated, he must die. No man has the right to punish a person who is not responsible for his actions, not even the state, and especially not you. Ask a mother. I demand that this man be handed over to the police. Hands up, police! In the name of the law... In the name of the people... This won't bring our poor children back to life. We must keep better watch over our children. 2 o'clock in the morning... Guess what? It's best if we don't see each other any more. So you can make decisions. Negative decisions, but it's better than nothing. - Are you expecting someone? - No. - Giulio? - He's in Milan. Hold on. Who is it? Who is it? - Who are you? It's 2am. - Step aside, arsehole! Who the fuck is he? I'm her father, now piss off. Grab your things, we're going home. No Captain, this is my home. You can't give orders here. You could do it with Mum, not with me. I gave your mother everything she wanted. She had a lover. I guess everything wasn't enough. You make me sick, I hate you. I pity you. Pack your bags, we're going home. That's what you did to her, right? You and I both know. I saw you. What are you talking about? With Mum, you hit her hard... She banged her head and fell. - Your mother and I... - Don't touch me! You were playing with your sister, don't you remember? Relax, I never told anyone. Not for your sake, but for Giorgia. She's so attached to you. Can't you tell she lives to make you happy? Nothing but the imagination of a girl who wants to be an actress. You're just a hysterical... ... drugged-up girl. - Pack your bags. - Leave! You're nuts.
