On our bloo.. We will not let them have their Manhattan. No homes for Zurich's gnomes. - No homes. no homes. We want our share of profit in our han.. Why the Red flao? Red is socialist. Why not the democratic Indian flao? That's Khambatta's flunky, shoot his picture. When God was distributing the ''Sma.''.. the union leader was standino there with a sieve.
