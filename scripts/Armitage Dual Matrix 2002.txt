Astro Technologies is making your dreams come true! We're advocating a project to safely create oceans... ...by using ice chunks floating in orbit of Mars. All we ask for is your support... ...and then we really can make dreams come true! Antimatter reactor has overloaded. Levels have reached critical zone! Danger! All personnel, evacuate at once! For the sake of humanity, for the sake of our righteous goal... DIE!!! The Third Project...? The reception of a distress call from an antimatter plant... ...on an isolated island in the Pacific... ...has resulted in the dispatch of an army special forces unit. According to our investigation, robots at the plant have rebelled... ...resulting in the deaths of many of the plant's staff. While the situation is now under control... ...we are currently waiting for a comment from the robot's maker... Yoko! Bye-bye! Good-bye, dear. Were you waiting long? Mr. Oldman! Be sure her mother comes by to help out at the bazaar tomorrow! Uh... Right! You think mommy will come? I dunno. She's not too good with stuff like that. Mommy, we're home! Where are you, "Mommy?" ...and the anti-robot movement has now spread all over the world. As a reaction, President Hemming of the Earth Robotronics Union... the leader in the robot industry... ...has just made a statement. Let's see that recording. The problem occurs in Seconds, manufactured only on Mars... ...which have a fractal circuit installed. These things aren't necessary for robots anyway. I hope the more frequent usage of Earth-made Seconds equipped with... Welcome home. ...human obedience circuits is reconsidered in light of this incident. ...human obedience circuits is reconsidered in light of this incident. That was President Hemming of the ERU. In other news... Mommy! That was President Hemming of the ERU. In other news... Check it out. That was President Hemming of the ERU. In other news... - Happy birthday, Yoko. - Congratulations, Yoko. A token of my affection, Naomi. Is today your birthday, too, Mommy? Same as mine? Yoko, those roses are my thanks for this feast your mother made for us. Oh, I get it. Okay, then I'll give you a thank-you present, too. My birthday, huh...? The Chicago police today announced the submission of a bill to the Assembly... ...to reduce the number of robot police officers who have been deployed... ...to work on simple duties such as... ...dealing with parking violations and cleaning up after accidents. It's expected to pass sometime this week. All right, after this commercial, we'll be back with a live interview... ...here at Blue 5 Net studios with Colonel Strings, the commander of... ...the 404th mobile troops which raided that antimatter plant. And now a Blue 5 Net exclusive interview! You were the first man on-site during the raid, is that correct? Yes, ma'am. The first one in and the last one out. Were the robots so dangerous that you needed to use guns? The only survivors were 8 of my men and just 3 of the plant's personnel. We tried our best. Are you on the side of the humans? Or are you on the side of the robots? My own beliefs guide my actions Humans are humans and robots are robots. Human rights are reserved for humans only, I'd say. Thank you for your time. That was Colonel Strings. This vehicle is in violation of traffic laws. Further pursuit is-- Who are you, lady? I have some business with the colonel. He's in there, isn't he? Right now, I'd say the colonel is enjoying a nice drink! What the...?! BOO! A Second, enhanced for hand- to-hand combat. Handmade... You're not human, are you? Who are you supposed to be? The Tin Woodsman in a full-body cast? I may get a bonus if I just... ...take your head back with me, my little Dorothy. Ow... Damn, that thing's strong! I just need to have your head left, or else I won't get any bonus. I may have overdone it... "Rank: sergeant." "404th mobile troops, reserve forces." I knew it. One of Strings's men. They sure have this planned out... Yoko... This may take longer than I expected. So, you're still alive... The lost Third... The Angel of Death and Life, eh? Hm? Oh, hi, Kevin. You're relieved. Anything left for me to worry about? - Not a damned thing. - What's that? Someone mailed in a threat. Earth-lovers, most likely. They apparently don't like the fact... ...that we make high-compression propellant here. They say Martians should live in the deserts... ...and stop wishing for oceans. Well, have a nice shift. All set... Good luck! Shit! You aren't going to break through the security here! Give up! Oh, we'll head straight home after we blow up this facility... ...and all the rocket fuel here! C'mon! C'mon! Is that all you've got?! Shit! GOOD NIGHT, BABY! How are you? Hurt bad? Nah, it's nothing serious. Good to hear. Man, you did a great job in there. Outstanding, really. Unfortunately, there are some complications... Huh? The police have just issued a statement. They stopped the vehicle with the escaping terrorists... ...and arrested the last three. It's just... The three of them are all robots. Robots?! But, what about the ones I killed? They were human. Humans...?! But there was no way I could tell in that situation! I know, I know. We'll have lawyers at the press conference. The only words you'll say there are "No comment." Got that? Everything'll be fine, so don't worry. And dress those bandages up to make it look worse. You're a hero who risked his life in the line of duty. A victim. Got that?! Okay, come on! Hi, Julian. Hi, Armitage. It's been a long time since anyone's called me by that name. You saw it, right? Yeah. You mean about the First Error, right? - Tell me about it. - It doesn't interest me. - Why not? - Because I'm a ghost. I couldn't care less about things in the mortal world. Julian! Thanks, Julian. Judging from the situation... ...Mr. Kevin Oldman merely carried out his duty, that's all. But the three human terrorists are dead... ...while their three robot accomplices are completely unharmed. Is there a special reason for that, Mr. Oldman? I believe we explained that already! When you have terrorists who are... ...ready to use a liquid explosive bomb breaking in... ...do you think there's time to sort out... ...which are human and which are robots?! The question was for Kevin. Please answer it, sir. He's been through enough today! Would you cut it out already? Hold it! Just a moment! Are you one of those robot fetishists? Do you subscribe to "Deep Robo" magazine? Do you use a robot maid? Ever had sex with a robot? Would you all stop it?! Robots only do what they're ordered to do! The real criminals are the humans! ...and Mr. Oldman has gained an amazing amount of support... ...as the vanguard of those who believe in Robot Rights... ...and desire a new social order which denies human supremacy. Furthermore, the incident is expected to have a large effect... ...on the upcoming Chicago Summit between Earth and Mars in 2 weeks... ...which will address the Robot Rights bill. We have an analyst here with an opinion. Should robots be granted the same rights as humans? Most of Earth had been against it and would say no... ...but the more liberal Martians had favored it. Because of that, the bill was expected to go nowhere... ...but the aftermath of the First Error... ...slightly moved Martian public opinion against it. However, this latest incident has revitalized Robot Rights activities. Well, our focus now will be on... ...how this all affects the upcoming summit. You really did it this time, Kevin. Or should I say Ross Sylibus? I'm sorry, all of the robot doormen were let go. Let me get that bag for you. Who are you? You're Strings, right? I came to ask why you killed those robots. What? I'm talking about all those robots you killed. Killed? Robots? Don't you mean "destroyed?" Does that include the humans, too? You probably know that 18% of that plant's staffwas human. You act as though you were there yourself. For the sake of humanity, for the sake of our righteous goal... You...! You're a robot?! You're garbage! Some sick monster who gets off on killing! You killed them all to hide the existence of the Third Project, didn't you?! Third? What are you talking about? Don't play dumb! Hold it! Hold it right there, Naomi Armitage. Demitrio... I can just see tomorrow's headlines: "Hero of the First Error suppression, murdered by robot assassin." What?! Sorry to have exposed you to such unpleasantness. How do you know my name? Well, well, well! Has life on the run dulled your detective's intuition? My name is Demitrio Mardini. Executive Vice President of Earth Robotronics. And you're the daughter of the great genius, Dr. Asakura, are you not? I've so looked forward to meeting you. This is an honor. Welcome to Earth, my dear! Now, shall we get down to business? I've brought him, sir. It's been a long time, Ross Sylibus. Mr. Chairman... I called you here for a reason. I need a favor, Ross. Y- Yes, sir... Would you go to Earth, please? I want you to attend the Chicago Summit. As the representative of me, Frederick Ohara... ...chairman of the Martian Development Foundation. You'll go, won't you? Me, sir...? To begin with, the remarkable advancements... ...in robot production techniques on Mars have been driven by necessity. The birth rate has been dropping dramatically... ...since the fourth generation of colonists. And there's a labor shortage. That, in turn, led to a need for robots to be dependable partners. If they're to be partners, they need to be given rights... ...protected by law as good citizens and good neighbors. It's the only logical outcome, isn't it? But it's an outcome I can't allow. Demand for the Seconds imported from Mars... ...is slowing my company down. And if the Robot Rights bill goes through, things will get worse. It could shake every union to its foundations. As a businessman, I want to prevent that. So, you're spinning a new scenario. You made up the First Error, the robot uprising. Not quite. The uprising did actually happen. If you made it all the way to Earth like this... ...you must know about that already. I don't just know about it! I saw it! I'm carrying the memories of a Third who was built in that plant! I see. It's fascinating how you robots communicate... Listen to me. You Thirds live a very sad existence. No one will acknowledge you exist, and so you're doomed to be forgotten. What I want is to give you all a clear and specific purpose in life: The creation of human beings! A most honorable purpose, is it not? Oh, that's bullshit! Why do you think the Thirds rebelled... ...when they were forced into that research?! Well, I can't believe it. Your friends tried to escape from the Garden of Eden. Listen, this is a wonderful operation I'm proposing. From time immemorial, the most difficult task has been... ...the creation of humans you can manipulate freely. Now you can do it. You can make a cheap labor force who will never complain. Or produce soldiers who aren't afraid of dying. Creating people to simply love would be nice, too, wouldn't it? The ultimate product, wouldn't you say? You... You want to play God? Not quite... Perhaps just have the power of one of His chosen. And that's why you killed the human staff members as well. Yes, that's right. So, won't you come with me? To my Garden of Eden? If you have that other Third's memories, you must understand. I need your power. I need you... The original Third. Go to hell. You disappoint me. Grab her! You seem to be in pain all of a sudden. So, how do you like its jamming functions? All right! Take her! What's wrong?! This date's over. You're just not my type! Did she get away? Or is she dead? No... She's a Third, after all... Oh, I found a real beauty here! This isn't some consumer model you can get off the assembly lines! Skeletal frame says "Made on Mars." Well, let's ask this little stranger who she is... These are her latest memories. I doubt it misfired... Oh, I see... She took over its power systems and then must have activated... ...the gun's safety and its proximity fuse at the same time. Well, that's how you use telepresence abilities! Hey! Quit poking around in my memories! Didn't mean any harm! I'm Mouse, a repairman. And you, my dear, are a mess. Your main autonomous nerve lines and vital parts are completely severed. If you went to a dealer... ...they'd tell you to forget about repairs and just buy a new body! Unfortunately, I'm kinda attached to this body. Anyway, I need to move again. Can you do that? CAN I? I am a genius! However, it'll cost you. Payment to be made in Earth dollars. And no IOUs! We will soon be arriving at the orbital station. The following connecting shuttles are scheduled to leave from there: Chicago, flight 102, departing at 13:00. Daddy, it's just like you said! It's so pretty! Toronto, flight 618, departing at 14:10. Yeah... Would you go to Earth, please? We've worked so hard on... ...the Robot Rights summit and have gotten so far. I naturally intended to attend it myself... ...but in light of what happened to you, I've changed my mind. Earth is very nervous about... ...the rising drive for Martian independence. They're threatened by the pressure for... ...the Zephyria terra forming project. And now they're telling us to accept... ...40 million immigrants during the fourth stage of development. Their attitude is drastic. The point is, Earth wants to keep Mars as its colony. Despite what it says, we all need robots now. Not just for Martian development, but for humanity's future. And the Rights bill is necessary for that future. I agree with you. But, why me, sir? Because you're the man for the time. The hero of Mars. Oh, you may not have intended to become that, but you are now. I would like to use your standing to full advantage... ...in getting the Robot Rights bill passed. Ross... You can't keep hiding forever. This is also a good chance to ensure Yoko's future, isn't it? Let's say, if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours... Thank you for choosing All Martians Spacelines today. What have you got there, Yoko? It's a secret! I hope we see Mommy soon... And with 2 days to go until the Chicago Summit on Robot Rights opens... ...All Martian Spacelines flight 102 landed... ...with the Martian representatives today. Among them is this man, currently the talk of the town. Mr. Kevin Oldman. So, he's still alive... As a result of his comments... ...made after the terrorist attack on Astro Technologies only days ago... I see now... ...he's received overwhelming support from Robot Rights activists. So, that's what's going on. ...he's received overwhelming support from Robot Rights activists. Nice job! Okay, I have a few little things to do now. Once I'm done, we'll go look for Mommy. Before the opening of today's summit on Robot Rights... ...all of the major robotronics companies'... ...sagging stock prices are now taking off. This is due to their announcement that all robots will now be made... ...with a slave circuit installed which will guarantee loyalty... ...and ensure that robots will never harm humans. Stockholders are also reacting positively to the possibility... ...that the industry's healthy economy might be restored... ...should the Robot Rights bill fail to win passage. Welcome, Mr. Oldman. What's going on here?! Where's my daughter?! Please, cal m down. As you can see, she's unharmed. Yoko! Why are you doing this?! I want you to vote against the Robot Rights bill. What?! The reason being... Well... If I call you this, will you understand then... ... Ross Sylibus? How did you...?! You seem to catch on fast. If you vote against the bill... ...your pretty little daughter will be returned unharmed. If you don't do as I ask, well... It's all up to you, isn't it? It's now time for the vote... ...at the much-anticipated Chicago Summit on Robot Rights. Let's now go live via relay to the summit. Ross...? We will begin taking the vote. All those in favor of the new bill from Mars... ...the Robot Rights bill, please stand up. What's going on? As expected, all the Martian delegates are for the bill... ...while all of the Earth delegates oppose it. Once again the Martian bill will not easily pass-- What's this?! Mr. Oldman, one of the Martian delegates, isn't standing in support! If he doesn't stand, the bill will be thrown out! He's up! No, wait! Ross! He's approaching the chairman. Three votes for passage, four against, one abstention. The motion is denied! Mr. Oldman has abstained from the vote! This is a completely unexpected turn! The bill has not passed! He abstained... Well, I'll let it go. What am I missing? Or are you telling me the ability to conceive life... ...is only in the province of God...? Hi there, Demitrio! You want my data? Hi there, Demitrio! You want my data? Who's...? Yes. Then I'll transfer over some sample data for you. If you want the merchandise, contact Mouse Robot Service. Your password is... An informant, eh? Interesting... All set. Please feel free to deal with Mouse Robot Service any time. You now have the last of the data... Hold it. Let me confirm this. So, this is the last of the data, you say? BULLSHIT! This isn't all of it! It is, I swear! What you wanted is on that disc, too! What I want is the data on her ability to conceive! Wh- What...?! Tell me! Where are you hiding it?! I don't know about any such data! If it's in there, it's somewhere out of my reach! Anyway, I gave you everything I have! If you can't analyze it, your system must be obsolete! Don't play dumb! I can't complete... ...the conception functions with just this data! That's impossible! You should be able to clone her exactly by copying the hardware... Something must be wrong, then...! You...! You don't have the vital piece?! Some informant! What the...?! Armitage...? Just like her, aren't they? But I'm still missing that last, vital part. Now then, give me the remaining data. I told you, I don't have it! Don't you want to see robots who can give birth to children? Oh, get real! He must have a connector somewhere. Rip the data out of his memory bank. Well? Shit... All that leaves us with is the daughter. Dump this trash in the bin, would you? That son of a bitch! I won't forget this! I swear... He'll regret messing with me...! Hotel Royal Greenhill. The Martian Development Foundation representatives, please. Well, they've gone already... Mr. Kevin Oldman, as well? No, he isn't back yet, so he's still registered as staying in this hotel. Can I help you with anything else? No, never mind. Thank you. What's happened, Ross? Sorry to keep you waiting. Where's my daughter?! You promised me you'd return her! Relax. As promised, you'll be with your daughter again... In Heaven. You were planning this from the start, weren't you?! What the hell...? Get out! Who the hell are you?! Police officer! Well, formerly... Why, you...! What?! These guys are nuts! The day Yoko was born... I was so happy. The happiest I've ever been in my life. But I was worried, too. I was worried that, one day, I might lose both you and Yoko. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I left without telling you. But I just had to know the truth. Because I'm a Third, too. And now my precious little Yoko is mixed up in all this. Some mother I am...! Naomi... Stop trying to take on every problem by yourself. We can change our names and forge new identities... ...but ifwe can't escape our destiny... ...then we'll fight it. For Yoko... And for us as a family. Ross...! Yoko's waiting. Let's go get her. Thank you, Ross... Your ID cannot be confirmed. If you do not leave within 10 seconds, you will be removed by force! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! I'm here for my daughter. Now move! Two! One! If you've harmed my daughter, I'll kill you! I'll keep that in mind. Give me the company info of this building! Search: Demitrio! There! Ross! Do you hear me?! Yeah! Room 49, level 258! It's some sort of lab, but I think she's in there! Naomi, I just contacted Mars! I've had a shuttle readied for us on an unused orbital elevator! It takes off at 5:00 AM! That gives us four hours! Naomi, don't do anything reckless. They're after my secret. I'm not gonna let them get their hands on me so easily. Anyway, don't underestimate them. I hear you. What, him again?! You wanna end up like you did before? You're a slow learner, aren't you? I'd prefer it if you wouldn't wreck any more of my merchandise. Demitrio! Shall we discuss this? All I'll discuss is you giving me my daughter back! Sure you want to brush me off so quickly? Yoko! You can't release her. I have the access protected. Is this it? Shit! The door's locked! Can you release it? Impossible. It's protected, so my telepresence won't work! Ross, there's something else! Listen to me! That room's a freezer! What?! Yoko's in danger! I'll buy some time. Ross, you'll have to handle it. There, that's better. Shit! I ran some tests on your daughter's body. I found no unusual abilities in her. How disappointing. Just a normal child... What did you do to Yoko?! Did you hurt her?! Hurt her? My dear, I'm not a barbarian! I just took some small blood and tissue samples. You can relax. I have no use for a normal child. Daddy... I'm a lenient man. I'm willing to forget the considerable damage and rudeness... ...you and your husband have inflicted on my company. However, that depends on you telling me... ...what the secret of the Thirds is. Daddy! The secret of your ability to conceive life. My secret? You really want to know? Shall I show it to you right now? You really will? Closer, please. A little more... Yeah... Right there. Wait! You apparently still don't understand your position here. I can set you free if you wish. Or I can shut your loud mouth permanently... ...by having your pretty little head ripped off! But, if you do that, you'll lose the secret forever. You foolish man. Don't you know where the power to create a child is in a woman? What?! Her heart! You don't just make a child with your body! The love she feels for someone! The need to protect them! The need to pass those feelings on to the future... ...is what makes a child! You'll never understand that! It's the software... Is that it? After her! Who are you?! Replicas...? Do you fakes think you can beat the original?! Mommy! Yoko! Mommy! Mommy, I missed you! Thank God you're okay... Mommy, look! Here! Your thank-you present for my birthday party! It's a bead ring! I worked really hard on it! I wanted to give it to you as soon as I could. I see. I'm sorry, hon. What's wrong? Th- This is just...! Yoko! Naomi... What are they? Naomi, hurry! - Go without me. - What?! - I'll hold them off here! - NAOMI! God dammit! That know-it-all bastard! How could he do that to me?! Oh, great. Not again! Let's see... Well, let's give it a try and see. Looks like this elevator only runs as high as this floor. How do we ride up from here?! Daddy, this way! This way! We can go up through here! Yoko! Don't go running off! But we can go up this way! How do you know that? I saw it downstairs! Doesn't look like it's coming down. Someone's behind us. What?! Daddy! NO!!! What's wrong? We're not there yet. Yoko's in danger... Please, I want you to release my combat-mode limiter! WHAT?!! Don't you know what would happen to your body... ...if you initiated your combat- mode without the limiter?! Your power level would be mind-blowing, but still... You'll exceed your internal battery's output limits... ...and that Class-L heat radiator system you have inside of you... ...wouldn't be able to keep up with it! That lovely skin you're so proud of... ...would melt down after only a minutes! In the end, your body itself will lose all control! I'm aware of all that! Please! There's no time! Sheesh! Don't blame me for what happens! All clear? The password to release your limiter is "Heaven's Door." Knock once, and it opens. But if you push things too far, you'll end up in Heaven for real! Anyway, let's go! Daddy! Daddy, this way! R- Right! Yoko, by any chance... ...did you memorize the whole floor plan? Yeah. But how? I just looked at it. Daddy, give me a pen, please. I never realized... You're a real genius, aren't you? Shit! It's them again! - No! - Yoko! Stay away... Mommy... Naomi! Get on that one! - Ross, hurry! - Right! Yoko! Man, this is getting exciting, isn't it? But the real show's about to start. And you, my dear Demitrio, are the star! I have one more favor to ask. What?! Another one?! You copied my memory data, didn't you? There's something I'd like you to do with it. She's slick, I'll give her that. Well, not like I'm one to talk... Okay, then! Here we go! IT'S SHOWTIME! We interrupt this program for a special report. MGN has successfully secured extraordinary footage... ...of the robot uprising which has become known as the First Error. As this footage shows, the energy plant was actually... ...a front for illegal Third Project research. These shocking scenes capture the project's failure... ...and the attempt by the ERU, fearing its disclosure... ...to suppress the truth. We've also received information which deeply implicates... How dare he...! How dare that little rat...! ...ERU Executive VP Demitrio Mardini in this affair. What's wrong? It's two against one! Don't hold back any longer! Don't let any of them off the Earth alive! Shit! Yoko! Hang on tight! Naomi! C'mon, get on my back. Hang on as tight as you can...! Almost there! Daddy, we're almost there! Welcome to the No. 6 Chicago Orbital Elevator... ...your gateway to space! Naomi! There's the shuttle! C'mon, let's go! Yoko. Yoko... Get back! Yoko! NAOMI! Naomi...? God dammit! Yoko! Get your hands... Get your hands off Yoko! Mommy... Mommy! - Mommy! - Look out! MOMMY!!! Heaven's... DOOR! Talk about your simple programs! "Pursue targets and kill them," huh? This is my limit...! Still...?! Dammit... There's no way I'll be beaten by you! Mommy! Mommy! Stop it, please! Yoko... You're hurt so bad... You're going to die! GO BACK TO YOUR MASTER!!! Mommy...! I broke your ring... Sorry, hon... Then... Then I'll make a ton more for you! 'Kay? Mommy, you're squishing me! Mommy! C'mon, let's go home. You think you're getting away?! This vessel is unregistered! Verify its license number! Vessel confirmed. Noncompliant license detected. Security system, engaged. Do you wish to clear it for takeoff? Like hell! Transfer weapons control to me! That order requires a double-A or higher security authorization. This is Demitrio Mardini! Password is... Verify! Confirmed! Warning! Warning! Departing unlicensed vessel cannot be cleared to leave port! If this warning is ignored, use of force is authorized! Now you'll see... It's you! Wh- Why did you come back? Ready to fire. Why...? I told you before. That if you harmed my daughter, I'd kill you. It can't be... Armitage...?! Please initiate firing mode. Please initiate firing mode. See you. It was announced today that the government would proceed with... ...the realization of the Zephyria terra forming project... ...which had been planned a while ago but till now... ...had been on hold due to many points of contention. This project will involve the dropping of ice chunks... ...floating in high orbit around Mars onto its equator... ...in order to form an artificial ocean. C'mon! C'mon! Over here! Whoa! I'm soaked! Hey, what about Mommy? - Mommy! - Yeah, splash her! Hey! Ooh, now you're gonna get it! Come on! Okay... Now I've got you! Jesus Christ. Between picking you up from that blast site... ...and fixing you up this much, it's been a lot of trouble! Are you awake now, my honey? Yes, my master!
