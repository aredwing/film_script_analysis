Running a little late. Tell Jimmy to meet us at the house. - Over. - Copy. Here we are. Home sweet home. Enjoy the fresh air. Last time you'll get to. - Now, let's go. - I'm goin'. Let's go. Hasn't changed much, has it? Hey! - You're late. - Yeah, traffic. - Hi. I'm Jimmy. - Hi. - Let's get started. - All right. Yeah, it's a bit bulky. Actually, I keep requesting the smaller ones, but the department won't spend the money, so... Just put the fucking thing on her. I'm gonna need your leg, please. Is that too tight? - What, is this a date? - No, it's fine. There you go. Now, it stays on your ankle all the time. It never comes off, even when you shower. Key stays with me. You're now under house arrest, and you'll remain on these premises for the duration of your entire sentence. - Understand? - Yes. Good. Jimmy, show her how this thing works. You're free to move anywhere within 100 foot radius. If you go past the 100 foot perimeter, an alarm activates. If the alarm continues for more than 3 minutes, a signal will automatically be sent, and the cops will be dispatched to the scene immediately. That would be me. Break house arrest, you go back to jail. Any violation automatically adds 10 years to your sentence. You get it? - Do you get it?! - Yeah, I get it! Also, if you attempt to remove the electronic ankle bracelet, or otherwise tamper with the base unit, again, an alarm will automatically alert the police. Just try. Okay. I wanna make sure that you have maximum mobility within this restricted area. - Thanks, Jimmy. - You're welcome. Now, the base unit comes with its own power source, so even if we get a blackout or something, it's live. Ms. Watson, go to the front door, please. Good. Good. What do you think you're doing? I got to get the mail, don't I? Any questions? None on my end. How about you, Lou? Goodbye. You got it. Have a nice day, Lou. You'd think you guys would have cleaned that up. You made the mess, you clean it up. Here you got the next year to sit in this house and think about what you did. I hope it doesn't give you a minute's peace. You, son of a bitch! If you'd have answered just one of my 9-1-1 calls, or taken any of my police reports seriously, Mike would be alive today. You didn't have to kill my partner. Better him than me. Carol! What do you mean you got no one in the area to turn the power on? I called Con Ed twice today. The guy said he'd be here between 1 and 4. Not until Monday? Oh, man! I got to go a whole weekend with no electricity? That's just great. No. No, that's it. Thank you. Hello. Honey, your fine ass better be in front of a color TV watching American Idol, with a Hagen-Daz in one hand and a bottle of Johnnie Walker in the other. What's up, girlfriend?! Same bitches different day, you know. How's everything on the outside, baby? Well, I'm home, Chandra. But, you know, they gave me one of those electronic bracelet thingies, you know? So it's like I'm sort of still in jail. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Go get laid. Oh, I don't know how much action I'm gonna see stuck in this house. Use the phone. Make a booty call. You don't know how lucky you are. You make damn sure you never come back here. Rosey and Johnson are still in solitary for that shit they did to you. I could never go back inside. I'd die first. Listen, my time is up. I gotta go, but I'm glad you're home. The girls in Cell Block "C" say hi. - Call me. - Come visit. Who's there? Oh, shit. Oh, no... Oh, no, no, God! Please don't be a rat. Oh, God! Oh, my God, you scared the shit out of me! Come here. Hey. Come on. It's okay. Come here. Come on. Hi... It's okay. I ain't gonna hurt you! Get back. Get back or I'll use this! Back off! - How did you get in? - Don't cut me! - How did you get in? - There is an open window in the basement. - The basement. That's where you've been staying? - Yes. In the basement. - Get out. Get out. - I'm going. - Get out! - I'm going! Hi, is this Gristedes? Do you deliver? - Who's there? - Gristedes delivery. Hang on a sec. - Hi. - Hi. It's a long story. Oh, come in. Where do you want these? Kitchen. Just down the hall. Anywhere. - You just moved in? - Yeah. Well, not exactly. It's my house. I was away for awhile. I live just up the street. This place was closed up for the longest tome. I thought... the cops had... I don't know. - It's a nice place. - Oh, thanks. - I'm Marnie. - I'm Joey. Hi. Hi, Joey. I'm gonna need you to bring me groceries regularly. Is that okay with you? The market is right around the corner. Yeah. I know. I'm kind of the stay-at-home type. That's cool. I can use the tips. Right. - How's five? - Yeah, thanks, that'll be cool. So, um, what do you do? Oh, I... I work out of the house. Right. Well, cool. Okay, well... Yeah, well, I guess I should be getting back. - I'll see you around, Ms. Watson. - Marnie. Right. Nice to meet you, Marnie. Robbing the cradle. What happened? I fell down. No. What happened, Marnie? - I don't remember. - You remember prison? How did you get a bruise on the side of your face? I don't know. I guess it happened when I... - I fell down and hit my head. - Oh, really? No. You don't get a bruise on the side of your face when you fall on your head. It looks like a person did that. It wasn't a person. Marnie, was there somebody in this house with you last night? No. - You covering for somebody? - I don't understand what you're talking about. I'm asking you. Is somebody beating on you and for some reason you're covering for them? No! Why would I do that? - All right. - Thanks. I guess living in a house where you killed your husband must be tough on anyone, huh? I thought you would have cleaned that up. There's no such thing as ghosts. I think I found one, cat. Is this Magnum Sales? Yeah, I'm calling about your ad saying you're looking for phone sales people. It says here you can work out of your own home. Who's there? Who the fuck is there?! Thank you, Con Ed. That's what's wrong with me. Caffeine withdrawal. You had it coming! You hear me?! You had it coming! You beat the shit out of me for years! And when you were on the juice it was worse. It's your fault you're dead. You, bastard! You were gonna kill me. This is my house. And I'm not leaving, you hear me?! This is my house! You'll have to kill me first! Hi. Well, I see you haven't lost your flair for the dramatic. Oh, I cut myself shaving. I can't believe you came. Well, I left a message. I told you I was coming by with the papers. I know, but, I thought maybe you'd send your assistant or something. - Well, where you want to do it? Here, or inside? - Oh, no, sure. Come in. Sit down. So I see you're still biting your nails. Yeah. Thanks for noticing. I'm glad you're out, and doing well. Well, it's not a penthouse overlooking Central Park, but it's home. And now it's your home. I'm gonna make some coffee. Want some coffee? No, thanks. Look, I have no idea why it was mom's dying wish... that you should have this place when you got out, but, I couldn't talk her out of it. I don't understand why you're so angry at me. Just sign the goddamned papers, Marnie. No. Not until you tell me. Tell you what? That mom drained her life savings to defend you? That I had to watch as the stress killed her? And then to top it all off, she used her life insurance to pay for this dump for you? Is that what this is about? Money? You really don't get it, do you? This is about you. It's always been about you. - Precious little Marnie. - I thought you worked this stuff out in therapy. You know, that's exactly what I would expect from you. You create all kinds of problems and then, you just assume everyone else is gonna clean them up for you. This is the end of the line for me. So, what are you gonna do now? Go back to your fabulous life of book publishing and tell all your socialite pals you're an only child? And to think I never thought you caught on that quickly. It's ironic, isn't it? After all these years you're the one who got all the attention. And now you'll spend the next year in this hole, with no one but the rats to fall for your shit. Trick or treat! Hey. Thanks. - Marnie, you okay? - Yeah. Never better. Come in. - What happened? - Well, I fell down the stairs. My Pop had to wear one of those for 6 months. I don't know who it was harder on, him or my Mom, but... she said things were a lot easier when he wasn't hanging around the house all the time. - How long you got to wear it for? - Longer than 6 months. - Yeah. I know. - You do? Talk around the neighborhood was some cop got killed by his wife. This place was empty for years. You moved back. Two and two, you know? So, people been talking about me, huh? Yeah, I guess. - Bad stuff? - Those people are idiots. Those people used to be my friends, Joey. Carol next door, the Romeros down the block. We used to have 'em over for barbecues. I mean, I used to watch their kids, for Chrissakes. Now they don't want anything to do with me. Hey, screw those jack-asses. - You want a cup of coffee? - Yeah. Sure. So... what's the deal? I mean, what happened? I don't know if I should talk about it. That's cool if you don't want to talk, but if you do, it's okay. We married right out of high school. And we were really in love. But, as soon as Mike joined the force, he changed. He hated his job, hated it. And he brought it home with him. That's when the beatings started. People didn't see the bruises? He knew how not to leave marks. - You must have reported it to the police, right? - Yeah. I filed 6 police reports, Joey. His buddies investigated it. Mike denied it all. And then he beat the crap out of me again. I had nobody to turn to, nothing I could do. So I saw a lawyer and I filed for divorce. I was gonna move back to my Mom's, but... papers got shuffled and then he got served a day early. - He came at me with a knife. - It's okay. - I got so scared. - It's okay. Somehow something came out of me, you know, I... I... I got the knife away from him and just, I, I went at him... I stabbed him three times. Side. Neck. Chest. He died over there in the corner. I know I committed a terrible crime. A terrible, terrible crime. But I'm not a murderer, I'm not. Look. I wanna be your friend, all right? I figure you can need some, though. I don't give a crap what anybody says. - I'd like that. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Good. All right. Well... this... is... my house number. And... this... is my cell. - Okay? - Okay. You call me if you need anything, all right? This means a lot. Like I said, anything you need. Oh, yeah, actually, there is something. Name it. Could you go to the library and get me some books? Sure. What kind of books? Ones about ghosts. In order to cleanse an area of an unhealthy spirit, it is first required that said area be thoroughly... eradicated of all the decedent's earthly possessions, belongings and reminders. What do you think? You got 9 lives, what do you care? The easiest way to get rid of a ghost is to simply ask it to leave. Okay. Use a firm voice and tell the ghost exactly what you want and why. This is the traditional practice of smudging a home. To get rid of an unwanted entity, crack a window in each room of your home, take a dried bundle of sage and smudge your home, clearing out any negative or stagnant energies. Smudging is simply lighting the sage bundle and walking around your entire home... allowing the smoke to circulate and cleanse the energy and space. The main thing is your intent, which is your faith. Your intentions are to rid the home of negative energies and spirits. They will know this, if they are there... Oh, fuck! All right... Okay. Okay. Everything... Oh, shit! Prick! Marnie, open the door. It's Shanks! Marnie! What the fuck is going on here? - Nothing. - Bullshit. I heard screaming. - Now what happened to you? - I fell out of bed. - It looks like somebody's been beating on you. - Oh, yeah? Like who? It's just me here, Shanks. You should know that. You've been staking out the place day and night like a stalker. Well, there's been people coming in and out of this house. Is there somebody in this house right now with you, Marnie? - Define somebody. - Meaning what? Look around. Let me know what you find. This is the police! Anybody in this house, step out with your hands on your head! Come out with your hands up! He must have slipped out the back before I got here, huh? What the hell do you want? You're not telling me something. Marnie... Marnie, did somebody else kill Mickey? - What are you talking about? - I'm asking you. Did somebody kill him and forced you to take the rap? No. Has that person come back here to make sure that you keep your mouth shut? Is that what's going on here? No, that's not it. I think that is it. I think that is it 'cause you're not even back in this house for a day... before somebody starts smacking you around. I think they're back. I think they're here, I think they're threatening you again. That's it, isn't it? - Isn't it?! - I wish. Marnie, who killed Mickey? Who killed Mike, Marnie? - I did. - Bullshit! Who really killed Mickey? It's that kid, isn't it? Yeah, the one who's delivering your groceries. You don't think I do my fucking job, Marnie? Joseph DiCenzo, did six in Juvi for grand theft auto. That little mother fucker killed my partner, I swear to God I'll kill him myself! You leave him alone, okay? You leave him alone, Lou, he's just a kid, okay? He's my friend! He hangs out and he talks to me is all! Why are you covering for Mike's killer?! Let me help you, Marnie! Let me help you. You don't have to be afraid. Just tell me who the fuck killed Mike?! Just tell me who did it. We'll put him down together. We'll put his ass in jail, and you can go wherever the fuck you want! Let me help you! Let me protect you! You can't protect me! Marnie, I went back and I looked... I looked in Mike's files. I saw all the assault reports you filed on him. It was just like you said. I should have done something. But, Marnie, he was my partner. And now I gotta live with that. But I will protect you now, Marnie. I give you my word. But you gotta talk to me. You wouldn't believe me. Try me. Mike did this to me. Marnie, Mike's dead. Yeah. Well, he's taking the news badly. What? He's a ghost. - A ghost? - Yeah, That's right. You know that line "Til death do us part. "? Well, that's a crock of shit. You're crazy. You're fucking nuts, I can see it in your eyes. And now you're here, you're back under Mike's roof... and you're going nuts. Wow! Lady, lady, lady, lady! You can't pack your trash like that! You gotta wrap it properly or I just can't take it! Come on, Mister, please, just this one time, okay? - I promise next time I'll do it. - I told everybody on my route... Lady! Lady! Oh, fuck! I can't get rid of you if you left something here. Prick! Where is it, huh? Where the fuck is it? Fuck! Come on, huh? Where is it?! Goddammit! Oh, my God! Oh, Mike... you were one dirty cop. Thank your coming, Father. I wanted to give you this. A donation I wanna make to the church. It was my husband's. It's been a long time since you've been to confession, Marnie. I'm here now if there is anything you wanna tell me. Perhaps you could unburden yourself of any guilt. I understand this isn't the ideal confessional, but whatever you say will be strictly between us. Oh, please, help me, Father. I don't know what to do. Help me. Did you kill your husband with murder in your heart, Marnie? Search your soul. No. No. I was defending myself. Then I pray you find peace. Thank you, Father. One last thing, Father. Could you bless this house for me? No. I don't think I can do that. The money's gone, Mike. I gave it to the church. The last thing in this house that belonged to you is gone. There's nothing keeping you here. This is my house now. I want you to leave and be at peace. I want you to leave my house, Mike. It's time for you to go. I hope you can forgive me. I bear you no ill will. I want you to leave my house, Mike. It's time for you to leave. Oh, no! What do you want? I can't take this shit anymore. Alright. Alright, Mike. Huh? Do it. Come on, huh? What are you waiting for?! Come on, do it! Come on, Mike! Yeah? - Joey, it's me, Marnie. - Marnie? Oh, hey. - You said I could call. - Yeah. What's goin' on? - Did I wake you? - Nah. I'm just chilling. I didn't mean to bother you. You're not. It's good to hear your voice. Is everything okay? Look... Can I come over? - No! That's not a good idea. - Why? It just isn't, okay, You have to trust me on this one. I'm getting my shoes on. No, no, no. Joey, no. Not tonight. - Some other night, huh? - I promise. Well, sweet dreams. Hey, Marnie! - What the hell are you doing here? - I was in the neighborhood. Yeah, right. Look, I'm gonna camp out on your doorstep unless you let me in. - Joey, you can't come in. - I'm getting soaked out here. - Joey, you gotta go home, okay? - Please, come on. Let me in. No! I'm gonna stand out here all night in the rain unless you let me in, so, come on... Fine. Catch. Watch it! Hey. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. Damn. I'm fine. That was funny. I'm sorry... - Hey. - Good morning. - I slept really good. - Me too. - I can't believe it. - What? It's a beautiful day. Nooo! No! No. Mike, noooo! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No! No! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No! - I'm going in. - Copy. Marnie! Marnie! - What do you want? - I got a warrant for Joseph DiCenzo's arrest. - I know he's in there. - Nobody's here but me, and the ghost! Marnie, I've been outside of your house all night. Now, cut the shit. - I know he's in there. - Well, let's see the warrant. - Come downstairs and I'll show you the warrant. - You can show it to me right here. Now quit fucking around with me and open this door. - I'm in the shower. - Put some clothes on and open the door! Just give me a few minutes, okay? - We are at the back door. - Hold on. - Marnie! - Joey isn't here. Just hold your freaking horses I'm... - Shanks! ... getting dressed! - Check the basement. - Alright. - Check the basement! - Okay. - Marnie?! - I'm coming! - Where is he? - Easy. Where is he? I told you, he's not here. He's not here. What do you want from me? Let's go. Go by his house. Check by that market he works at, he's gonna show up. Alright. Come on. - So you admit he was here last night. - Yeah. - And when did he leave? - I don't know. Around one. - And what were you doing? - Screwing each other's brains out. - In your husband's house. - In his bed. This isn't over. - You know the way out, detective. - I don't know where you stashed this kid, or I don't know where he's hiding, but I'm gonna be out in that car all day every day... until he comes back, because I know he's coming back. Marnie. You bought yourself maybe 2 or 3 days. I want you out of my house, Shanks. Okay. What the fuck?! You? What the fuck?! Get out! Put your fucking hands up! On your head! You, fucking bitch! Get your fucking hands up! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of fucking law. Go ahead, arrest me. I'll never be free anyway. I got you. Alright. This is Shanks. I got the DiCenzo kid dead. In the woman's apartment. I got her cuffed. I got it under control. I'm bringing her in now. Over. Let's go. You win, Mike! What the f? Mickey? Mickey, it's me. It's Lou. Mickey... what happened to you? You stay away from her. Mike, you stay away from her! You stay away from her, Mike! Stay fucking away from her! Stay away from her, Mike! Mike, you stay away! Shanks... Shanks. Shanks, wake up! Come on. Wake up. Shanks! Shanks! Come on! Wake up! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Come on! Shanks, wake up. Oh, shit! Oh, Come on! Marnie! Shanks! Shanks! Shanks, can you hear me? Marnie? Where are you? Answer me! Marnie! Hang on! Marnie! Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on. It's over! Marnie... Come on. Shanks... Are you okay? Come on. You should go. You should go.
