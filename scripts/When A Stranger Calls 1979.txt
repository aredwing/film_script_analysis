Doyou thinkyou're gonna be talking to him sometime tonight? - Who? - Bobby. Probably. You know... Bobbyaskedme to go out with him this weekend. And I was reallytempted... 'cause I like Bobby a lot. As much asyou do. But I told him I couldn't... 'cause I didn't think it was right because you were my friend. You are my friend. Yeah, I guess so. Listen, do me a favor. J ust give Bobby the number here. Okay? Don't tell him I told you to. Okay. I gotta go now. Bye, Nance. Thankyou. Yeah. Bye. Hello? Haveyou checkedthe children? What? - Hello? - Haveyou checkedthe children? Dr. Mandrakis? Oh, yeah, sure. Dr. Mandrakis. Hello? Haveyou checkedthe children? Robert, I don't think this is veryfunny. Bobby? Who is this? - Golden Bull. - Hello. Is Dr. Mandrakis there? This is his baby-sitter. Holdon a minute. - Hello. - Yes. Dr. Mandrakis left the restaurant about 40 minutes ago. - Forty minutes ago. - That's right. - Operator. - Could you get me the police? - Is this an emergency? - Yes. Well, no. Not really. The numberis 555-9431. Wouldyou like me to connectyou? Yes. - Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker. - Hello. I've been getting phone calls about every 1 5 minutes. It's a man. I think he's trying to scare me. An anonymous caller, ma'am? - That's right. - Has he threatenedyou? Has he been using obscene language? Sometimes he doesn't say anything. He just keeps calling. Well, there's reallynothing we can do about it down here. - Is the phone listedinyourname? - No, I'm just a baby-sitter. It's probablyjustsome weirdo. The city's full ofthem. Believe it or not, we get reports like this everynight. It's nothing to worry about. - Oh. - Have you tried whistling? What? Ifyou can find a good loud whistle in the house... blow it into the phone, hard, the next time he calls. Probably break his eardrum. He won't botheryou after that. No, I-- You're probably right. It's nothing to worry about. Hello? Whyhaven'tyou checked the children? Seventh Precinct, Sergeant Sacker. I called you before about the man who keeps calling me. - Oh,yeah. - He called me again. Didyou try whistling? No. He's out there. Out where? In the neighborhood. He's watching me through thewindows. Didyousee him? No, but I know he's there. - Is the house lockedup? - Yes. Well, thenyou'resafe. Ifhe wantedto break in, he wouldn't be callingyou. Please, can't you help me? I'm all alone here. Okay. Take it easy. I'll tellyou what. Ifthis guy calls again-- He will call again. I know he will. All right. Now, calm down. Look, I can alert the phone company so ifhe calls again... we can try to trace the call. What'syour number? And the address? Oh,yeah. I know where that is. Okay, now. Ifthe guy calls again... uou try to keep him on the line for at least a minute so we can trace the call. I can't do that. He doesn't stay on for more than a couple of seconds. Well, that's the only way we can helpyou. By the way, what'syourname? Jill Johnson. Jill, the important thing is foryou to relax. You're safe whereyou are. We've got patrolmen cruising that area all night. Just stay calm. Willyou do that for me? Yes. In the meantime, we'll be watchingyour line. All right,Jill? - Yes. - You call again ifthere's anyproblem. Good night. 'Night. Hello. It's me. I know. Who are you? I'm not gonna be here much longer. Dr. Mandrakis and his wife are coming home. I know. Can you see me? Yes. I'm sorry I turned the lights down. I'll turn them back up ifyou like. No. Don't. Don't? You've really scared me... ifthat's whatyou wanted. Is that whatyou wanted? No. What doyou want? Yourblood. All overme. You don't know who I am. Orwhere I live. And Dr. Mandrakis will take me home, or maybe even the police. You've calledthepolice? I wanna talk toyou. - Leave me alone! - This is Sergeant Sacker. Listen to me. We've tracedthe call. It's coming from inside the house. A squad car's on the wayright now. Just get outta that house. Are the parents here yet? Yeah, they arrived about ten minutes ago. Christ. What a homecoming. What happened, Charlie? Wewere less than a block away when the call came through. When we got here, the guywas still upstairs in the kids' bedroom. Hewas covered with blood. - Blood? - Not his own. The children have been dead for several hours. Oh,Jesus. He'd been using some old phone the parents never had disconnected. Who is he? Well, we found this merchant seaman's card on him. He's English. Entered this country less than a week ago. How about the baby-sitter? She'll be all right. I'm Lieutenant Clifford. I'm very sorry. I'll tryto be brief. Sit down. Thankyou. Soyou're in business foryourselfnow. Yes, sir. For the past three and a halfyears. That's good. And you'd heard about Curt Duncan's escape? Oh, yes. Doyou think the police will find him? I know they haven't assigned anyone to it specifically. - It's an old case. - An old case. - Can you find him? - Yes. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this week, but I'll find him. - He could be anywhere by now. - I don't think so. Because he's a foreigner, he'll come back to the city. After sixyears in confinement, that's the only place that's familiarto him. That's important. A man murders two children in cold blood. Ajury declares him insane. How could such a person not be? He's sent to a state mental institution... where the security is less than perfect. And he escapes. It isn't fair. A thing like that... should never be allowed to happen again. I couldn't agreewith you more. Go ahead, then. My accountantwill contactyou. Thankyou. Thankyou. State Hospital. Curt Duncan isn't going to run right out andkillmore children. I'm not worriedabout that. We hadhim in here forsixyears under continuous therapy-- some ofit rather forceful. And drugs, tranquilizers, depressants, lithium-- Eventually anyone will respond to the treatment here. You gave him electric shock? Yes, some. It says here thirty-eight. Thirty-eight times? It's a fairly standard procedure. Well, whatwill happen to him now... without the drugs hewas on? Oh, there'll be some deterioration. That's inevitable. We can't say how much. During the time thatyou had him here, did you discover... any particular habits ofhis-- peculiarities, quirks? - Anything that might help me find him? -Yes, of course. It's all in the folder, Mr. Clifford. Any mail from people back in England? Family? That, too, is in the folder. Let's get something straight here, Doctor. I've been 33 years in the business of tracking people and putting them away. Spent almost a year on Curt Duncan alone with the trial and the testimonies... and the background investigations. Now, I didn't come here todayto look in your goddamn folders. In fact, I wouldn't be here at all ifyou'd doneyourjob right. This is a hospital, Mr. Clifford, not a penitentiary. Everything appertaining to one ofour patients is meticulously recorded... in that patient's folder, whetheryou can make sense ofit... or not. Doyou want to know how much we really understand ofthe human mind? Listen. This is Curt Duncan... shortly after hewas admitted here sixyears ago. ...to giveyoumedication that will calmyou down. We're notputting anything inyourfood, either. No? I've got to eat the food? It doesn't taste right! That's Duncan. Curt, why areyou fidgeting? Can'tyou get comfortable? No! I'm not comfortable! Don'tyou look at me. Don'tyou talk to me. Don'tyou touch me. Stay away. - Curt, I'm only trying to helpyou. - Stay away. Guard! Guard! Grab him! Help! Hello. What you been up to? My own business. Look. Thanks for the light. Next round's on me. Look. I've got my own money. So ifyou don't mind. Afterwhat I've been through, I don't mind anything. See, that's thewhole point. My mind. Your mind. Where do theyfit in? Doyou seewhat I mean? Okay, pal. Doyou live around here? Get offofme! Oh, listen. I didn't mean anything. I-- You see-- - I don't live around-- - Hey! I thinkthe ladywants to be left alone. I thinkan apology is in order. Is that the best you can do? I thinkyou better move along, pal. Bill, it's okay, really. He's-- No! I want him out ofhere, man! Areyou deaf? Go on! Beat it! I'm not gonna say it again, mister. This is Torchy's. I want to report a fight. Whoyou callin'? I don't knowwhy I keep coming back to this dump. Charlie? Hey, Cliff. Let me fixyou a drink, man. - Let me talk toyou. - You want some ofthis? - No. Thankyou. - What's goin' on? I wanna talktoyou in private. Sorry. - You know these people here. -Yes, I do. - What's going on here? - I wanna talk toyou privately. Huh? Come on. I can't take any more surprises tonight. You did this, you dirty dog. Yeah, you did. Let's go upstairs for a minute. All right. Now, what's going on? Come on. Tell Papa. - You getting married? - No. I got a job this week, tracking someone. Fantastic. I knewyou could do it. - Yeah. Keep up the good work. - It's Curt Duncan. - What? - You didn't know he escaped? I need your cooperation on this one. Yeah, sure. Anything you want. Anything. Oh, it's you. What doyou want? I came to apologize. Listen, I'm the one who should be sorry. I didn't mean forthat to happen. I'm new in town. I don't know anybody. Where areyou from? Excuse me. Hello? No, I just got in. I don't know ifl can. Listen, I can't talk right now. Can I call you back? All right. Bye. I-- I'm from New York, actually. Look, you can't come in here. Well, I thought perhaps we might get some coffee. No, I don't think so. - Somewhere nearby? - Not tonight. You'd better go. I got no place to go. Well, you can't stay here. Just a coffee? Please? Well, maybe tomorrow. Okay. Tomorrow. When? I said maybe. I don't know. Look, I'm sorry about what happened this afternoon. I really am. All right? Thatwas my boyfriend on the phone. He's coming over. So please leave. Now. - I likeyou. - Look! Doyou want me to call the cops? It's okay. I'll seeyou sometime. Later. I still want to buyyou that drink. Howlong willyoube here? Depends on howluckyl get. I wanna look through the oldfiles on him. Check everyrecent report ofassault, vagrancy, things like that. J ust wanna askyou a question, Mr. Trumble. - All right. What doyou wanna know? - What was stolen? Wake up! Godbless it! Get outta here. Out! All right! Damn it. All right! What doya say, partner? Hey, looky here. I'm dry as a bone, man. You got any money? Well, keep the picture. Ifyou think you see him, I'd appreciate a call. - About four blocks. - Yeah? Down bythe park? - A foreigner. Has a British accent. - No, I haven't. He's about my height. Light complexion. I wasjust with that guy. Lookedbad. - Where? - Hell, I can't remember. Probably see him again, though. I'll tell you what. You leave that moneywith me, and I'll see that he gets it... as a favortoyou. I gotta talk to him. What's the matter? Don'tyou trust me? We can work together. Yeah. Sure. You keep the bottle, huh? I'll be back. - Bar downtown? - I got the address ifyou want it. Appreciate it. Shit. Who is it? My name is John Clifford. I'm a private investigator. You're a what? A private detective. What doyou wantwith me? I thought maybewe could talk. Ask a few questions. I don't know nothing about anything or anybody. Shit. Listen, lady. I can be back in 30 minutes... with a search warrant and a handful of cops. I could probably haveyou arrested, whether or not the charges would stick. Now, you wanna let me in and talk? Haveyou got a badge? I'll showyou a badge when you open the goddamn door! I don't have a badge. I'm issued a license, a piece ofpaper. And I left it at home. You Tracy Fuller? Can we sit down? You recognize this man? Why? He's escaped from the insane asylum. Seven years ago, he murdered two children. Broke into the house and found them asleep in bed. Itwas a little boy, four and a half, and his little three-year-old sister. Afterthe coroner's investigation, the bodies were taken to the mortuary... where the undertaker took one look at them... and said their bodies couldn't be reconstructed for the burial... without six days ofsteadywork. Then he asked what had been the murder weapon, because looking at the mess... he couldn't imagine what had been used. The coronertold him there had been no murderweapon. The killer had used only his hands. He's been here. Think he'll tryto seeyou again? I don't know. He-- He said he had no place to go. Let's play it safe. Let's assume hewill. Will you workwith me? You found him. You found him. I thinkso. Where? From here on, I go it alone. Whytake a chance on it, Cliff? - We'll letyou have the credit. - No. I'm gonna kill him, Charlie. The closer I get to this guy, the more-- He gets to me. I don't know. Look, you better go on home. You're falling in. Not this time. This is the case that makes up for a whole career. Ifyou don't understand that now, you will in a fewyears. Who hired you to do this? So nowyou're a hit man. Jesus Christ. He killed two kids in cold blood! You were there too. What areyou gonna use? Lock needles. You are straining ourfriendship. Ifyou blow this thing at all-- You'll never hearfrom me again. All right. Takeyourtime. And do it good. You okay? All right. Keep it, honey. Mytreat. No luck. Did you see him? He still could be out there, though. - Oh, God. - Areyou okay? I'm gonna hang around outside for a while. I'll be back, on and offagain, all night. - You sureyou're all right? - I'm fine. Boltyour door, and don't let anybody in, no matterwhat. I'll be seein'ya. Listen. Thanks. Sure. I must talktoyou.
