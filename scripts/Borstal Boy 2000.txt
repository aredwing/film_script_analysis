You're the Irish bloke they were talking about. IRA, Fucking hell I'm Charlie Milwall. I don't like fucking sailors. I love your Irish accent, china. Who were you bringing the stuff to? I'm no informer. Do you know what happens when we hang you? You swing there at the end of a rope with the biggest hardon you ever had, only it's too late. You're dead. You've never had any. Ever been with a girl, Brendan? You do like girls, don't you, Brendan? Maybe he doesn't like girls. No? What's he doing with this then, eh? That's not mine. We need to know your contact in this murder gang. The IRA is not a murder gang. Then why are they being hanged for murder? They're dying for the country. Condemned men on the way. Up the republic. We'll teach you how to behave. You Irish shit house. Paddy bastard. Brendan? Brendan? You're all right mate? They were - putting a rope around my neck. It's just a dream mate. Is all it is. It's just a dream. I could feel it . Just a bad dream, is all it is.. Just a bad dream, Brendan. Your're gonna be allright china. You will be allright. You stay away from me! Do you hear?

Next! Three sodding years. Bastards. Listen. Apologize to the judge, agree to cooperate, and you could be back home in Dublin by the end of the week. Calling Brendan Behan. You stand accused of the most heinous and vile conspiracy. It would give me nothing but pleasure to don my black cap and pronounce the severest sentence under the law. I came here to fight for the Irish workers and small farmers republic. I will not allow political speeches in my court! Up the republic! All right. All right. All right. What did you get? Are they going to hang you Irish or what? I'm under age. I got four years borstal. All right you boys. Come on, step lively. ? Safe journey? Yes, sir. We have three civilians, for detention. Excellent. All right, boys. . Hands out of your pockets. Come on. Lock him up. Bet he's in for a rather unplesant time. Gentlemen, there is not much point in escape. There you go, Jock. In the first place, it's so easy, there is no glory to it. Second, the army are laying mine fields, so it's jolly dangerous to be wandering about. And third, the military is just up the road. So, having caused everyone a great deal of bother, You will be brought back. So, don't sneak off without telling me. I trust we shall have no further use of chains. You are borstal boys now. Are you the IRA boy? Yes, sir. Yes, I understand you had a rather rough time in Walton. Well, that's all behind you now, so, keep your nose clean and you will do fine. Carry on chief! Right you lads. Attention! Attention! Quick march! Jesus! Do you feel like a kiddo boy? You got that right. Fellows, we got some new recruits. Right chaps. Just get your stuff organized beside the bed that you want. Right? I will have this one. No, sir. That's my bed. Was. Sorry? Sorry? I'm in charge now. All right? Hey, what's his story? Polish Jew. Caught stowed away in a British ship. Why aren't you wearing shorts? Head boy in each hut wears longs. # We are the peat bog soldiers # marching with their spades # na . Hey, Brendan. How comes a Yid knows an Irish song? No, it's a German song. My granny taught it to me. Was your granny from Germany? No. She's Irish, but she's a communist. And she knows every song from here to China and back. Wish I had a granny like that. Oi, you. What's your name? Milwall, sir. Put your back into it, Milwall. This is not an old ladies' camp. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. How long are you in for? If the Germans come, I am dead. I must get to Palestine. There I am safe. You'd be safer in a neutral country. Like Ireland. Neutral? What is neutral? It is not in the war. That's our way out. Come on, lads. You escape? Vhen? Not for a while. There is someone I have to talk to first. Come on. We've not got all day. Hey, guys. Where the hell is my tobacco? Who's the thief? Look, I had a whole pack, and it's gone. Maybe the pigs took it, ? Jock. How far did you get when you escaped? Are you thinking on escaping? I am the expert escaper round here. How far did you get? About five miles. The whole area has been cleared of civilians in case there's an invasion. 'Course, only bastard has got a shotgun and a bloodhound. Can't believe it. Where we head if we ... Train station. I need to get to Glasgow. Nobody will find me, never. What? They found you easy enough the first time, didn't they? Hey, nobody has escaped from here but me. Right? I have a reputation to protect. This is my escape. I decide who goes. What makes you so especial? I'm a POW. It's my duty to escape. Eww. What's a POW? Prisioner of war. Well, if we are going to do it, we need do it right. You know, I mean, get rid of these rags, get proper cloths and all. The first thing we need is a map. We need to know where we are going, Jock. A map! Where do we gonna get a map? It is a rather unusual request. These things are very hard to come by in war time, but... we'll do our best. Thank you, sir. It doesn't matter if it's a second-hand ball, sir. Once it's a ball. Any type of real ball, sir. Once it bounces, sir. I do not see what this war has got to do with you. You're Canadian. What about Hitler? We've all got to fight Hitler. Excuse me, miss. You dropped something. - Oh, thank you. Charlie Milwall, at your service, miss. Thank you, Charlie. Isn't she a bastard? Just thinking about her is enough to have your prick cut off. See, what you buggers don't understand, is that women are gagging for it. Not from the likes of you, you big scottish poof. Hey. There's no poofters up north. Can't say the same for in here. I've got in love with that Scot waiting from me in Glasgow. That's why I'm going to escape. I've got to. I bet she is not as juicy as the one I did. You what? He's in for rape, isn't he? Good, was she? Better than you lot could ever imagine. Bobby Emmell on our corner got married at sixteen. He gets it every night. Married? What a mug. You see, the best part is taking it when it is not being offered. I wouldn't mind having a go at the governor's daughter. Hello, Dad. Elizabeth. I'm home. As you insisted. Well, you can't stay in London in the middle of the blitz. I'd be in Paris if it wasn't for this stupid war. You can't blame me for the Germans being in Paris. I blame all men for war. Don't talk nonsense, Elizabeth. I'm an artist. How am I expected to paint here? Well, if you are really serious about it, well, surely you can paint anywhere. You're hopeless. Elizabeth... Look, dad, don't treat me like one of your prisoners. What are you looking for? You know, a map book. What kind of book would that be? A book of pictures of... just pictures. Comic books are over there. Brilliant! Great, thanks. And you're our Irish rebel, am I right? Only one, as far as I know. I've got the very thing for you. by Frank Harrison. The life of Oscar Wilde... I'm not interested in Oscar Wilde. Blasphemy! Fellow Irishman, fellow jailbird and rebel... You know what he was done for, don't you? I know there aren't any songs about him. Which is odd, for a rebel. He was put in jail for buggering the son of the marquis of Queensbury. Shocking, what? He was no Irishman if he was up to that caper. No, local history. What have you got on local history? Let's see. Must be good. You'll get blind, china. Here, have this light here, take it, it's yours. I - I don't mind. I'm fine as I am. Why being such a brick? You took care of me when we were in jail, I took care of you. We're meant to look out for each other. That's what friends are for, ain't it? You're not my friend. What did you do, then? Shut your mouth. Right then. Time for the final. All right lads, get together. I expect a fair contest, no biting, no kicking. Play! I only want to talk to you. Save your breath. I don't know how much longer I'm going to be here, but as long as I'm here, we're going to respect each other. Understand? What do you think of them, John? They're both rather good. Give it to him, Charlie. Just friends? Yeah. Do you submit? No. Don't make me hurt you, china. Yes. Submission! Yes! And the winner by submission is Milwall, in the red corner. Well done. Hard luck, lad. Well done, Milwall. Congratulations on a splendid wrestling final. Milwall, we have a small prize for you, which I know will come in useful. Go on, open it. Show us, Charlie. Someone must have sat on it. Friends. That's all. I don't want to hear that "china" stuff, right? China plate - mate. Just rhyming slang. See, if you mean "friend", you can call me "china" any time I like. You understand that? It's like ice, Brendan. It's freezing. Looks like you're having a circle in here. I'm not queer. I like girls. I knew that from the beginning. How did you know? By your hair. My hair? How can you tell by my hair? Your split's the wrong side. Us queers, we split it the other way. That's how we know one another. I'm sorry, I... You want some? Aw, come on, we just finished All right, all right. Will you take me with you? What? When you escape, you'll take me along. I don't believe it. That's sacrilege, what they're doing. Hey you boys, don't do that in front of a Welshman. That ball is meant for throwing, not kicking. Here, I'll show you. Come on, come on. Give me the ball. Right boys, get in line. Right across the field. You hold the ball firmly, and pass like that. Boys, that's what you call rugby. It's good. It's kind of like American football. You want to give it a shot? I leave English games to the English. I'm on it. Good throw, Mac. Break apart. Break apart. We're going to get cheek to cheek, and I don't mean ballroom dancing. I'm talking about your cheek against the other man's backside. Right boys, down with you now. That's it. Push. Hold it, here's the ball. Hold on there, lads. I need some voluntiers with experience in painting and decorating. No sex offenders. Proper decent criminals only. Come on then! Irish. Milwall. One more than. Jock. Right. Follow me, then. OK, lads. In here. It's a dump, sir. No way! No way! There you go, miss. Thank you chief. My father insists I can make this a studio. What do you think? Yeah. Yeah. A coating of paint, you won't know this place. Aye. Obviously, these ... going to need to replace them, but... Maybe a plastering over there. Light's a problem. Talking about "light's a problem". There's plenty of light. It's facing East. Which makes it bright in the morning, but dark in the afternoon. See, an artist needs an even light. Is he right, Miss? So, you know what you are talking about. I always know what I'm talking about. And where did you learn about light? My people are all painters. Really? Anyone I would heard of? House painters. My mother had a picture painted once, it's hanging in the National Gallery of Ireland. M-Maybe you've seen it? No, I never been to Ireland. At least you had a mother. I never knew mine. No mother, so terrible. Yeah. I was grown up in an orphanage. I just hope some day I'll have a girl of me own. I am sure you will Charlie. Just get out of there, Milwall. You were never an orphan. All right. I didn't know my mother. I used to dream of being an orphan. Anyway, she seemed to like it, didn't she? Well, tell you, there's no way I am slaving for that upper class bitch! I'm no scabbie, nah. What those every escape operation need? Don't know. A headquarters. Hey Brendan. Look here. Hey. What you think you are playing up, brown eyes? Hello Brendan. Hello. This is Lieutenant Kidd, from the army base. This is Brendan. He is building my studio. My father served in Ireland. So did mine. Really? What regiment? First battalion, Dublin brigade, Irish Republic Army. Aw, IRA. David, why don't you challenge Brendan and the boys to a game of rugby? Wow. Are you up to it? Of course. Hey. What are you tackling? Leave him, damm. Useless jewboy! Come on back. Yeah. Army bet me a bottle of whisky if you don't score in the second half. Come on! There is more than honor in stake. All right. Let's go. The luck of the Irish. Looks like he's got it. Elizabeth. Bye. "Reviewing the momentous events of this great period of history" His Majesty the King, accompanied by Mr Churchill, toured the devastated streets of Coventry that has suffered the most indiscriminate and vicious attacks of Hitler's Luftwaffe. This was Coventry Cathedral. The cathedral spire and the front remain, the rest is rubble. The King accompanied some of the men who have lost their homes in the German bombing. God, that's the stuff. Mac's going to help with the... with the escape. The people's spirit is magnificent, and everything possible has been done to relieve their suffering. The plucky people of Coventry assured the Prime Minister the industrial... We work in the laundry. So we're going to nick some civilian clothes. We're on our way, china. We're on our way. All right, everyone. Only a mile to go. Come on, lads, no slacking! What's the matter with you, Jock? Sick, sir. He's had a little bit too much cake, sir. # We are the peat bog soldiers # marching with our spades # to the moor. This was the best day ever! So, when do we go? We've got to be very early on Saturday morning. 'Cause there's no head count Saturday, so no one'll raise the alarm 'til Sunday. Yep. If we get to the rear line, we have a chance. Yeah. If we have , it's got to work. Well, well, well. Hey. Look who's here. Hello, boys. Planning a little trip, are we? This is nothing to do with you, Dale. I'm taking over. I'm going instead of the Jew. Piss off, Dale. You shouldn't be siding with foreigners against your own. James is going instead of you. So are you? All right. All right. This is my escape! No Jew's. And no queer's. - Bastard. So Brendan-- have we got a deal? It's not fair, Brendan. Life's not fair, Charlie. When do we go? Next Saturday night. - Good. , arsehole. - Aye. Thanks a lot, china. It's time to go. You got the map? I gave you the bleedin' map! I thought you had the map! Aw, come on, bastard. Let's go. - All right, let's go. Here. This way. Come on! Jump. Show your guts. yourself. Come on. It's too high. - Come on! You're the best bleedin' china I ever had. Yeah. You too. This is not on the map, it ain't. Come on, lads. This'll do. That poxy Irish bastard! I should've known! I should've known he was a traitor! How many, Chief? There are five boys not accounted for, sir. All right, lads. No. - We're heading in the right direction. It must be So basically, we have no idea where we are. Whooo! - Oh yes! It's the Dead Sea! - [[ kaddish ]] So, you're with the Prince of Wales? Yes, sir. She's had . Wouldn't you rather be with her? Absolutely, sir. Well, you request transfer back, I'll see what I can do. Thank you, sir. Very much, sir. Well. What's all that about? me ship set in for action. Oh. You going? Difficult choice, Brendan. As a prisoner of war, it was my duty to escape. Oh, I see. So now two boys are dead? Yes, sir. You have nothing to save yourself, Milwall? I was just sticking for my china, sir. So if he jumped off a bridge, you'd follow? Yes, sir. You boys are going to have to live with this for the rest of your lives. But you do have a choice. You can carry on as before, skulking about like thieves and liars, in which case you will spend the rest of your lives in prison. Or you can take a good, long, hard look at yourselves and take responsibility for your actions and their consequences. So make your choice. Three months detention or your word that you'll make a new start. What'll it be? I bet you thought it was really clever that you could jump the escape, didn't you? Aye? Can't hear you? Get off him, you bastard! Get off me! Get off me! What's going on here? Nothing, sir, nothing. Just having a bad dream, that's all. You all right, Behan? I'm fine. It's coming on. Here. Just a sketch. , china. Will make a good "Wanted" poster. You must feel terrible about your friends. About killing them, you mean? It wasn't your fault, Brendan. Your father thinks it was. "Each man kills the thing he loves." Wh-What do you mean? " The coward does it with a kiss, " The brave man with a sword." What's that? It's Oscar Wilde, the Ballad of Reading Gaol. You should read it. Here, miss. Here's your picture. You keep it, Charlie. fancies What are you reading then, Irish? Oscar Wilde. Oh, the poofter, that one. Wasn't he a jailbird, like myself. You have an answer for everything, haven't you, Irish? Who is it from? It's from me granny. She misses me. I was always her favourite. She gave me this. It's Brendan the Navigator. He is a patron saint of sailors. I should have it then. I'm the bleeding sailor. So you should. No. Come on. Take it. No, I can't take that. I can't. Of course you can. Now the Navigator will keep you safe. It's wonderful! It's not done yet. I don't know what to say. How can I ever pay you? Some booze, cigarettes,... what do you reckon, Brendan? some food? I'ld love to put on a play. Play? What? Yeah. A play. Do you think your father would let us? What, Christmas pantomime? What, Cinderella? What do you mean? That's a great idea. No. I was thinking of something by Oscar Wilde. And you want me to ask. Is that the idea? Yeah! "I hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane." "It... ne-ver... it never is, sir." "Lane, you're a perfect pessimist." That's you. "I-I doh... I do my best... "to-to gay... give "sa-sa-sa-sati... Huh? Satisfaction. Satisfaction. "I do my best to give satisfaction, sir!" That's great, Jock. Yeah, good stuff. - Who am I going to get to play the girls? Well, frankly, I have always felt I was born to play a great lady, so... perhaps I could be your Lady Bracknell? Yeah! Then the only question is, who is to play Gwendolen and Cecily? It's so hard to tell someone that you like them, don't you find? I mean-- it's so hard to find the right words. Do I know this person? Yes. You have to tell him. What if he doesn't feel the same? There's only one way to find out. Tell him. OK. Come on. Quickly. I've got me breasts Quickly How do I look? I think you look like a proper little Madam. Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax, sir. Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well. I'm fine, Aunt Augusta, thank you. Go away. Break a leg. - Thank you. I have some questions for you. Do you smoke? Well, yes, I must admit I smoke. I am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some kind. How old are you? I'm twenty-nine, Lady Bracknell. A very good age to be married at. Just preparing tea, sir. Do you think we should marry them? Yes. I mean no. Your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier. That is all! Our Christian names! Is that all? But we are going to be christened this afternoon. For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing? I am. To please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal? I am. Darling. Darling. Gwendolen! What does this mean? Merely that I am engaged to be married. It seems you are displaying signs of triviality. On the contrary, Aunt Augusta. For the first time in my life, Ive finally realised the vital Importance of Being Earnest. No, no! Come back! No! Don't you worry! I'm not... Bravo! Congratulations to all of you. Thank you. Your was splendid! The Scottish accent really worked! Ah, it's nothing. It's not that exciting. That was quite a performance. We're all going to celebrate. Do you want to come? I can't go to the dorms. Of course you can. No, really, I can't. Aw, come on. I'll look after you. I'd like to. But I can't. Do it again! Do it again. - All right. He cracks me up every time. Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr Charles Milwall! Now, get your lips round that . What is it? What is it though? Cider. Where'd you get it? Nicked the keys to the stores. Oh yeah, I forgot you're a thief. # The bells of hell go ding-a-ling-a-ling # for you but not for me. You know how my old dad used to make the ? From apple When he had the apple juice all cast, before he put the lid on, he'd throw in a quart of brandy. And a dead rat. It's disgusting! Do we skin the ? # O Death, where is thy sting-a-ling-ling # O Grave, thy victoree? The next person to get this is the first one that brings me Milwall's kit box. Me faster! Me me me! - What do you want that for? Here's to Life. To Life. It was strange wh-when I kissed you during the play. Felt all right. Because it was someone else. - Yeah. Does that make sense? - Yeah. Well, well. You don't have to pretend to be anyone. You just be yourself. Can I? Yeah. Wouldn't like to be in his shoes. Who's that? Someone's coming. Brendan. Hello, Charlie. wants you up at the dorm. What does he want me for? Hello, Charles. All right? I wonder where these had got to. Nothing to do with me. How about this then, Charlie? I quite like this. I might steal it for myself. Yeah, take that. You really don't take the piss, though. So where'd you get it? None of your business. So fuck off. I know what I'd quite like to fuck. Well, come on then. Why don't you? You little bastard? What's up now? You're not man enough, aye? You dirty little... Bend him over. No! No! That's not right! Stay out of this, Jock. little queer! - Fuck off! Get off me! Charlie? Liz! Liz, go out! What--? Open the door! - It's all right. No, no, it's all right. Let me out! I want to go out! Open the door! Let me go! , eh? You bastard! Let her go, Dale! Dale! Stop! Brendan, stop it! Get off of me! Brendan-- Brendan-- Don't leave me, Brendan. Please. You all right? - Yes. Yes. Charlie-- What's the matter? . Brendan tried to save me! And he assaulted another boy. I have no choice. You devoted your whole life to saving these wretched boys, and now you have one worth saving, and you're going to throw him away? Because rules are rules! Your precious rules always mattered more to you than I did. That's simply not true, Elisabeth. No? Well, prove it. Bend your precious rules for me. I'm out. I'm joining my ship. I see that. Wh-Where are you headed for? - Singapore. Singapore? - Yeah. Can't get much further away from the Germans than that. - No. Oi, when you're done , we do have a war to fight, you know. Aye, aye, sir. Well, then... I'll see you. - Yeah. Yeah. It's all right, china. - Yeah. See you, chaps. Brendan, do you know what I've just realized? What's that? The importance of being earnest. So... - Get on the bus. Take it easy, Brendan mate. - Good luck, Albert. . That's right. Take her away. Just saying goodbye, sir. You're hopeless. See you. Try the next line. "O lad... that... that I love... l..." "Loved." - "Loved." "Of a lad that I loved"? How a man can love another man? Not just... you know, but love? Do you love your father? I hate the bastard. I love my wee brother You love a man then, don't you? That's not the same thing. It is, you know. Look that way. That's not fair. I won't show you your portrait unless you show your writing with me. But I'm in your painting. And I'm not in your writing? You wouldn't understand it. Try me. " Blas smara dubh' " tris bsteach " ar bharr an tslibhe. " I dtost an phriosin " feadail fhuar na traenach. " Cogar gire beirt leannn " don aonacn. " That's it. Give it to me in English. No. Teach me some Gaelic then. No. Well, at least tell me what it means. It's called "Uaigneas". It means, "Loneliness". " The tang of blackberries wet with rain on the hilltop " In the silence of the prison " the clear whistle of the train " the happy whispering of lovers " The lonely one " It's not bad. It's much better in Gaelic. It's wonderful, Brendan. It is. It's wonderful. Teach me some more, then. Yeah. Uaigneas. - Uaigneas. Cluas. - Cluas. Cluas eile. - Cluas eile. Aon, d. - Aon, d. Sil. - Sil. Sil eile. - Sil eile. Aon, d. - Aon, d. Srn. - Srn. Bal. - Bal. You're supposed to say stop. - I don't want to. Details of the devastation wrought by Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbour are still being released by the United States Government. America was not at war, and no danger was thought to be within 1,000 miles of Hawaii. - Aye, aye, news shite. - Japanese bombs did tremendous damage to American sea power, which was based upon Pearl Harbour. The result, of course, has been disastrous. "First films of the havoc inflicted on that fateful Sunday Dec 7th 1941" Meanwhile, Britain faces the shocking news that she too has been the victim of Oriental deceit. Attacks have taken place at Hong Kong and Malaya. Most shocking of all, the loss of the pride of the Royal Navy, HMS Prince of Wales. Caught in the waters of Singapore, the gallant ship put up an heroic defence before succumbing to the overpowering air attack. First reports point to the tragic loss of the entire ship's company, 2,000 men and boys. 39,000 tons, ten 40-inch guns. Lies on her side, capsized under the rubble. Brendan. Brendan-- are you OK? Stay away from me. It's all right. It's all right. It's OK. It's-it's all my fault. No, it's not your fault. Listen to me. It's not your fault. It's not. It's OK. Charlie said to give it to you. He said it'll keep you safe. No. No. Right. We're prepared to grant you an early release. But to do that, we need you to denounce the IRA. I've-- tried betrayal. It doesn't suit me. You see, Brendan-- we need an undertaking that you've stopped fighting us. I'll promise not to take up arms against England until you've finished this bastard Hitler. Beyond that, I reserve my options. We'll need that in writing. I can't do that. A borstal boy's word is good enough for me. Thank you, sir. Is that how you see me? You're not a laughing boy. I was brought op to hate the English. I had to come here to learn about love. And what did you learn about love? It's much stronger than hate. I learned that from you and Charlie. I had it both ways. Just like Oscar Wilde. You will write? What's the point? Not to me. Write. For everyone. Sln. Sln. Expulsion order? Are you Brendan Behan? - I am. . - . Must be wonderful to be free. Must.
