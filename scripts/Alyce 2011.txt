Have you been with her on the roof? - No, she wanted to be alone. She said she wanted to be alone. And you said she was upset. She crying? Violent? And yet, only her go on the roof? I did not know she was so upset. - But she was crying profusely. Carroll often cried. As Vince said or did something which she was hurt then they came to me. Then I tried to help her. But last night I was very tired and I did not know what to do for her. Is Vince her boyfriend? He Hit her? - No, that was not it. He's a good kid. - Except that he is cheating. Please. Thank you. I can not believe that Carroll has committed suicide. She is not dead, but is quite in the creases. This information is very useful in its identification. She can not talk. A visual identification is unlikely, given her condition. Her teeth are shattered and we can only take later fingerprints. Who knows how long that will take. I'm sorry. I do not feel so good. I think I need to lie down. Understandable. They will contact you if we need more information . Thank you. Dispatch, Inspector Warner. Possible victim identification. Jesus, what's wrong with you? These numbers have to do over again. That change them anyway. -. I do not know Is called estimated earnings. - Then again, the figures should be accurate. If you put it. - And I want them at 17.00. Not later. So I'm going to watch it with you. My best friend last night fallen from a building. I'll come back later. How is she? The good news is that they are of the intensive care. They have brain scans, MRIs . We're still waiting for the results. They do not tell us much. They want to do more tests. We'll see how that goes and have to hope for the best. Die hacked into it: there hope for the best. What should you hope else? Did she say anything? - No, her jaw was shattered. She has bitten her tongue through the fall. Why did she do it? I do not know. - Did she say anything before she went up the roof? She said she wanted to be alone. I wish I had gone with her. Carroll? Treasure? My god, sister? Carroll, please. Hold on. Are you coming? Here it is. Is Mouse out again? - As usual. Yes? You have recently sold our 'E'. - 'E'? What the hell is that? Ecstasy, the drug. Ecstasy. - The drug. Sorry, what do you say? - I want to buy ecstasy. Do you wear a wire? - What? Listening devices. By law I have to ask. You know what? I want to check out. Absolutely. Okay? - No, undressing. With him? I get those balls now? - No, honey. Your pants. A little decency, please. Pull your pants up. Sorry, boss. - And take off your shoes. Roll up your pipe, so I can see your ankles. That's what I meant with your pants. Do you get a kick out of? - I do. Can I buy drugs now? - Oh, you want drugs? Why did not you say so? Then you had this can all be avoided. I did not mind at all. Beautiful. - Want a beer? I did not come for beer. - I just wanted to be social. Taste this. This is not a courtesy visit. - Guys, they do not know who we are, huh? We are members of the glitterati, very extreme. You are drug dealers. - We are more than that. We are lords of the new church. We are travelers of neo-primitive. We are anti-establishement, anything. I have anti-fucked. We're communicators, errand boys of the old gods. We have found the enemy. - And that's us. Who's there? - Mouse, who are we? Drug dealers? Never mind. Gentlemen... ... I have to do business with this lady. - Oh, business. Mouse, get up, man. I imagine vulnerable... ... And assume that I can help in this sordid world of drugs you only. What I'm trying a new customer is, how do you say? No confidence grow, that would be ridiculous in this work. But professionalism. 'Cause I'm risking my health by fumbling for your pleasure... with you ... So I want something from you when I do this, you know? Let me guess. -. Please, do not do that well Not yet judge me. What is that? What do you think thus to buy? Give me now but a few. Okay, give me one. Come. Carroll... I'm talking about a relationship with a client. I deal in sin. I have to have something in return. You do not have enough money, but something that is priceless. Something that opens doors for you, opens the floodgates. We get the money out of the system. - You're corny. I'm guilty. You came to me, I have not forced. You come here, you do not even know me. We have not even introduced. Yet you into my house offering me money, too little money. It plays something that goes beyond drugs. Have you ever dreamed of someone while you were awake? Did you ever close your eyes and all that was really, really real? Close your eyes, take risks. I want to meet all your needs. From me you can demons in your eyes watch and they swallow. You'll be back. You are a lover. I go out like a candle. I wonder how it will be? What are the flame of a candle out after they are burned? I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Whoever calls the shots, bitch? No, do not. - What you got? Not showing up is automatic dismissal. - Why not show up? Where were you yesterday? - Here. That was not you. - Yes. Jackie ? Again, lady, and you're fired. I know you're cute, but even Clark can not save you now. Thanks Danielle, that you mention my mistakes... ... And warns me for my very predicament. I said 'not in my mouth.' - Come on, that's a crime or something? Listen, I'll give you something extra. I promise. Are we friends? Friends for life? - You're a pig. What a... Oink, oink. What a dramatic broad. Give the girl something stronger to curb its anger and carnal desires. You do not know me. - Let me guess: apathetic? Or indifferent? No, I get it: dreams of oblivion. Agree. I only wear the curse of immunity. What is that? - This is my brother. That's really him, I killed him. Really, I shot him. You're full of shit from your neck. - No, really. I was 12 and he was 15. We played with the arms of my father. I shot off half his head. Boom. My mother heard it and ran into the room. She slipped and fell on his brain with a rotsmak down... ... And breaks her hip. That sound I do not. Forget my whole life Since then, she could not bend over... ... So they had her on a stretcher drive to the funeral. That thing was huge, and her head was in a bracket. She was tied up and could not move. Just something antebellum expressionist, mixed with Hellraiser . Actually, it was pretty cool. That's him, that's the weapon. Save your gun? - That's all I have of my brother. Except himself then. Shall I tell you even really something funny? Do you see this gun? I'm 15 years old and what I do? I grab the gun and kill somebody. I ask my partner to pick me up. Imagine: I want to commit premeditated murder ... ... But can not drive because I do not have a driver's license. Word so you do not blow by society? The screwed us. What is it? Do it. Do it, man. Do it. - Yeah, we'll do it. Do it, damn it. Come on, hurry up. Come on, do it. Go ahead, do it. No, look. You should see. No, honey, go ahead. Do you want to suck here? I'll give you some extras, anyway. Come on. This is a joke, a trick. I knew where the ball is, you see? What did you do today? The last time you were so accommodating. And today you do not like it. She gegorgeld your seed? - Maybe she's nice though. Fuck. It is the monthly period. Go ahead, do it. Go ahead. Go ahead. Do it. Good morning, Alyce. Guess what. I tell you officially that you're fired. So, that being said. I need something stronger. It's going to cost something. Wait, wait. Calm down. What? Come on. - What? Listen, I want to talk. My God, that I find perverse. - I'm serious. Hey, I'm serious. What have you used? - Nothing, it's weird. Nothing at all. Something stronger for madam. I'll tell you something. This I have not just blocked. This movie... ... Is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Sit down. - No, thank you. Whatever. You know, you're just as criminal as me. I mean, who's worse? The victim or the one that comes after it? Are you hurt because I do not sit next to you? I feel that you judge me. Damn. See this? Did you know this was during Prohibition illegal? I can go to jail for drinking a beer. So who should pay whom if society does not know it? Let me guess: It's the fault of society . In a way though. As long as you can justify what you're doing so you can sleep at night. And that's what you say. You buy, I do not. - But I do not do out of generosity. The noblest men have ever worn criminals. Come on. Who do you have? Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Gandhi. Compare yourself with Gandhi? - You know, you're right. I'm a petty criminal. I'm the bad guy. I'll tell you something. I am nothing compared to those bastards in Washington, or Enron... ... Or bankers on Wall Street who have cheated us. And then war, the oil companies. Halliburton, the tobacco industry. This is much more extreme and men are totally legal? How can this be? What is worse? The culprits, the pushers, the Mack Anchor Burger... ... Or petty criminal who enters with a gun and the cash gets empty? The whole system is a house of cards collapses, and that currently in. I'll tell you what. If this country like which Mad-Max film, the soil... ... Then we have a lead. Some of us have buried their natural habitat. Some want the dirt between life... ... Because it seems more to life than that clean, mediocre mess there. From nine to five. Mopping? Watching a computer screen? "A large portion of fries? Anything else ' I want to ask you something. As an individual, as a human being... ... With something vaguely resembling standards. Do you... ... Right now anything in your hand? Wake up. It's me or you, kill or be slain. Here or there, does not matter. Survive the gross services. The healthiest? No. Relentlessly. And necessary. "If you do not kill me, we go outside and I'll kill you. You know what I mean? Who controls you? Here, thank you for the interview. That's new. Alyce, I'm so sorry. God. When I saw you, I was expecting that she arrived behind you. I usually walked behind her. - Did she leave anything behind you? Her purse is still there. Can I have that? - Of course, Vince. What you most remember from her? She was afraid of bats. I remember her eyes. She could look at you as if she knew something you did not know. I always teased her and said she was like an aquarium. So much was happening there. I loved, but I also know she was too good for me. I would never be good enough. What I was stupid anyway. I did stupid things to avoid she would destroy me. Honey, it's okay. Terrible. Sad that there is no one for her when she needed it. Do you mean me? - It was not your responsibility. You went through, she knew. I mean friends. Someone had to be there for her. As... Then she might still be alive. You look like shit. What have they done to you? You do not seem real... ... But you really are. You're so soft. You feel so good. Oh, Carroll. - What's she doing? I'm sorry. Do not touch her. - Stop her. What are you doing? Hold on. Release. What are you doing? Get out. Do you use drugs? - Harold, stop. What wrong with you? Disgusting. I hold you responsible. In my opinion you killed that girl. Leave her alone. You're right. I killed her. I first pushed her off the roof, but when she was not dead yet... ... So I grabbed a pillow and pushed and pushed... ... The life out of your precious daughter. My best friend, my only friend. Alyce, what the hell is this? Alyce, what are you doing? What are you doing? - Calm down everyone. You have to put a lot of. And I want you to leave. I want you to leave. - Harold, stop. Alyce, no. Alyce, you gotta go. I? Should I leave? Really? - Sorry. You did this. Lesbian necrophiliac. Crazy idiot. In the gym I have a spell. When I train, they know that I give them along it. So I always say: "You pull the kurtste end." Kurtste because I called Kurt. Yes, I know him. - It's a classic sense of Bugs Bunny You should come.. You can trapeziusspieren firmer. Working on the deltoids, not too much. Then stay there to look feminine, only hornier. To the extent that is possible. You need come. I'll take care of you. What you need, you name it. You do not say much, do you? Let's get outta here. Willingly, I like that. Nice house. I had a very wrong impression of you. I thought you were crazy. I get you anything? Do not. - Yes, this is getting better. I have to tell you something and I say against all the girls I fuck. You pull the kurtste end... ... Because now you will get the post of Kurt. - Would you stop talking. Fine. You're so... You're so awesome. Wait. - Why? This is good. Yeah, right there. - Tasty pimples on your back. I really do not use steroids. Go fuck me or not? - Good. Bitch. That's better. - No, that's not it. This is better. Okay, fine. - Jesus Christ, that hurt. No idea what you're talking about. If you do not use steroids, you hear on your back to have. No pustules You really are crazy. Easy, big guy. There is no cut. Just relax and let me do the work. My nipple bleeding, damn. My damn nipple bleeding. My nipple bleeding. Poor baby. Relax. I will not hurt you anymore, I promise. Come on, now. Calm down. - Kiss Me. Come on, now. Wanna taste my blood? Come on. You're crazy. - You fall into repetitions, Kurt. Enough with that perverted stuff. Enough? - Yes? Relax. You're kidding. - Hey, are you home? Can I come and get her purse so? - Sure, come on. You're kidding. I found that very delicious. And you? - Are you crazy? Thank you for letting shake stud. My world Now get out. Close the door behind you. My God, what happened to you? - Oh, that. I have been struck upon a pole. That does not look good. - It's all right. How are you? I keep at it and try to deal with it. I know. It's okay. You did not ask how it is with me. How are you? - I miss you. I miss her so much. I miss you. Alyce, what are you doing? It's good. Wait. What is that? Is that your blood? - Nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry about. I can make you feel better. Wait, do not. Can I please just get Carroll's purse? Hi, sweetheart. It's not convenient now. I love you. No knife. - What did you say? I have no makeshift knife. - What? What have you done? Get help. Call someone, please. I do not wanna die, please. - You make me quite sad. She wondered how it would be. - Please help me. Pitiful, it's pitiful. - Help me, please. And always the same. They would have been disappointed. Hi. - How are you? Can I borrow it? - Of course. Do you need help? I have a method of working. - What? How to rid you of a corpse. But if you need help... Can I borrow this too? - Of course. Thanks. Off that head. Any idea what time it is? - No, but I can look at my phone. I do not ask what time it is. I get upset, you know, about the noise. It's late. - Sorry, I'll finish this tomorrow. Finish what? - A corpse elimination. I grind it finely, that cuts easier. That's not funny. - I know. Who is this? - Old news. Why do you take Vince's phone? Come along, then you'll find out. Vince? You do not have to shout. - Is he here? Describe 'here.' - Is he here? He's here, but he's not. Not you respond to me. You have her suffocate, perhaps pushed. You have problems, Renee. - I? I have problems? Girl, you are the figurehead of the 'foundation problems. Calm but. - Do not tell me to calm down. Control yourself, Renee, otherwise I do. Come on, bitch. What you gonna do? Well? The knife is in Vince, so you strike with the baseball bat, head, I think. What are you doing here? - What loose ends meet. Your boyfriend Clark makes life difficult for me because I fired you. He's not my friend. - Anyway. It was not my fault, it is the policy of this company. I'm just doing my job. Clark did not even look at me. They always look at you, Alyce. They laugh at you. Why no one is looking at me? Why no one is looking at me? Jesus, what time is it? Is that light? It's too early. Wake me when the sun goes down. , Where is the bat for? To get control. Who controls you, Rex? Disturbed bitch. What the hell is going on? Are you crazy? Is that it? My brother. Bitch, that was my drug. Are you crazy? Stay down, I mean it. You're my bitch. You know, this is even better. You're my toy. Yeah, you're my toy. Let basically even. You are a prisoner. I am because you are and Russia, what's her name? You are... How is it possible. What?
