Stop, stop, stop, you haven't sent your family to mine yet. - My father's coming today. - Well, let him come first then. You know what, from now on I'm the son of the Director of Customs. - Son of what? - The Director of Customs. - What's that? - Something like a cop. He's in charge. - Something big, eh? - Very big. - Bigger than... the gendarmerie? - Bigger. - Than Yaar the Hood? - Bigger. Sort of like the state. On top of everything. Mehdi, Azamet is your fourth sister-in-law. So our sister is the village teacher? Congratulations. Couldn't come to your wedding but didn't forget your present. Oh, how could you know that I play the violin? - ahane wrote me about it. - Why go into all that trouble? Unload it. Quick, quick. Unload it now. - And this is your present, Mehdi. - What's his name? It has no name. You name him. - Napoleon. - My dear brother. You yourself are a Napoleon, too. - The train will arrive any time now! - The train never arrives on time. - What's this, Rahim? - A weapon. - You carry a weapon? - It's a gift from your late father. Let me take a look. It seems great! I'm firing it for you, Mehdi. - Where s my oldest? Where's Adem? - He was here a moment ago. - Where's my oldest? Where's Filiz? - She'll be here in a jiffy. - Welcome Uncle Mehdi. - Thank you. - Where've you been, Filiz? - I put the fire out, father. - Welcome, father... Uncle Rahim. - Where've you been, son? I put the fire out, father. - What do you see here, Mr. Rahim? - A hole. A hole... - So what's this, Uncle Rahim? - It's written, isn't it? State Directorate of Customs... Hey, let me look. Barbed wire. So, what's the story? Ankara, Ankara, Ankara oh so lovely All without luck dream to see you 1867 reels of barbed wire have been taken over... ...by the Directorate of Customs of Hislihisar. - Exactly 1867. - Exactly, we've counted them. - I'm signing. - Sign it. - Melek, bring the sugar. - O.K. - I'm so glad that you've come back. - Thanks a lot. There's no one here village you can chat with. I almost went crazy... ...when you were away. After all those years of friendship, 18 month... - never seemed to end. - Same here. We've been friends... ...since the years of the War of Independence. I was wounded... ...and you extracted the bullet. If it weren't for you... - none of this would have come to be. - Every medic would have done it. I was bus y with my appointment. Couldn't come to my father's funeral. - Was he cross with me? - Not cross, but sad because... ...he loved you so much. Even when giving the gun, his eyes watered. - May he rest in peace. - So he gave it to you, ha? That he did. And he said, "Rahim, my son, when Mehdi was away... in Ankara, you have done a lot for us. My most precious treasure is... ...this gun. This" he said, "I'm giving to you." His eyes watered. He praised God's Oneness, and Mohammed, His Prophet. He fought for breath and was gone. May he rest in peace. Official, did we measure the border correctly? I mean... ...some houses were le ft out. - Measurements come from Ankara. So. Well, the old stones also indicate this border. The great big Capital, they wouldn't err now, would they? - What's up, Mehdi? - I better take care of this border business my self. They won't be able to manage it. Wait, I'll see you off. - Mahmut, what is this? - The border, Director. What sort of a border is this? Have you looked at the measurements? I did. Border measurements are in line with the position of the old stones. - They are, eh? - Yes. - In line? - I have measured three times. Mahmut, there should be a mistake somewhere. Just take a look. - Well, Director, this is the border. - How come? The medic, the teacher and the whore of the town are all - le ft on the other side. - We cannot change the position... ...for just a couple of houses, Director. Oh god, now what! - Close your eyes. Did you? - Come out. - Shall we open them? - Don't. Do. How beautiful you are, Filiz. It becomes you so. Come. - What's wrong with her? - They killed her husband at Nazmiye's wedding. They shot him eight times in front of our eyes. He had just arrived from lzmir. Since that day, she can't talk. In front of her, you say? I would also cry... ...if they had killed my Adem. You should've seen Filiz's wedding gown. There were no such... ...wedding gowns in our day. Am I talking to the wall, Mehdi? - Don't you act in a hurry, eh? - Why? She waited two years... ...for Adem to finish his military service. Then 1,5 years for you. - What else should we wait for? - Just wait a little more. Till the barbed wire and Customs is ready. See what happens. - I m cooking you some chickpeas. - Put plenty of meat. Is Adem asleep? - He is. Came late last night. - adiye, watch your mathematics. - Make Cemil study, too. Come on. - Have a good day father. - Thank you. - We also have some rice dish. - Good day, Mahmut, my man. - And a good day to you. What a good thing this border is. Our entering and leaving... ...gained a significance. - II will be more significant... ...when you realize its importance. - Isn't it so? Mehdi, how are you? - Thanks, fine. And yourself? - I'm going to the circumcision... of Ramazan's son. What about Cemil's, now? - Shall we do it this week? - Hope so, if nothing comes up. What can come up? Or isn't a medic... good enough for the circumcision, now that you're a Director? - Will you have the doctor cut it? - It ain't a matter of a doctor cutting. When the customs officially opens, you should have a pass... How can I tell you? Anything can happen in this world. Look, I've brought you some Turkish delight. From this side. - Go over, woman. Best wishes. - Same to you. When Customs starts to operate this will be considered bribery. - You don't mean it? - Well, we better be care ful. ...and not without a leading light. This is noone's colony. We are a free country full with heroes and no masters. Where greed reigns and not the heart, there is no progress. There fore take your hand ladies, make music and dance. Shake your hips and fling your hair. We're calling Mr. Mehdi to the platform. My very esteemed district governor, esteemed pre fect... ...worthy commanders. Dear colleagues. Very dear citizens. There's an important reason for our gathering here today. - He thinks he's the President. - This reason is the establishment... ...of the Directorate of Customs. Here we'll open the Directorate. We will establish it and let it prosper. What is customs? Is it clear or do I have to explain it? - Do! Do! - So I will. Well, if there is Customs, we have to preserve it. If we don't preserve it... then in God's name who ever will? O.K. What's Customs then? Clearly something valuable, since it has to be preserved. Barbed wire is the ornamental rim of the country. Take ornamental rim... ...seriously. What is it for? When you look at the map you see... ...your country. You are both sensitive and intelligent. You understand what I'm say ing, don't you? Well, that's it. I now ask our district governor to open the Customs. Follow me. May it prove bene ficial for the country and the people. - Thank you. - May it be for the good of all of us. - Rahim? - What's up? - Come. - Yes, my dear Mehdi? - Come, let me kiss you once. - My friend. - Did you feel like it? - I felt like it. Thank you. - I brought cookies for you. - Thanks teacher, madam. - And how delicious they are. - Well, who should we feed but you? Heroic Turkish soldiers protecting us from the enemy. Open it so I will pass. This gate is a good thing... ...but it will be hard to open and close it all the time. I'll pass my self. - Forbidden! - What do you think you're doing? - I'll just pass! - Forbidden. - What now? - I'm the one asking that. What's this. Cookies! How can you eat that cookie? - Turkish soldiers aren't to be bribed. - I'll go to my school. - So I've brought you breakfast. - You can't pass over the border. - What? - Do you have a passport? - I don't. - Then you can't pass. But passports are for foreigners. This is my village. On your way home, now. No passport, no passage. Why haven't you told us be fore? - What does it mean? - Come on now, come on. - They don't let the teacher pass. - She was no good... ...for the children any way. - That serves her right. What's that... ...young bride doing with that old man? Maybe she has... ...eyes for that adopted boy, Adnan. - Don t exaggerate. Adem, you wouldn't know what secret services we offer. - He's the Customs Director's son. - Who cares if he's the Director... ...or the Sultan himself? Mind your step, or else I'll fix you. Thanks my lovely girl. - What's up, why are you back? - I couldn't get to school. - Why? - They wouldn't let me pass. - Who wouldn't let you pass? - That man, what's his name? Mahmut, he didn't let me pass. There's the border now. - We can't pass over. - Was Mehdi there? I saw no Mehdi. - What's it, father? - I'll talk to Mehdi. Hey Selami, my nutty boy, did the state put a border for you, too? - Mehdi, my brother, how are you? - Thanks, I'm fine, and you? Praise be to the Lord. I haven't seen you only one day and I've missed you. - Let me pass, so we'll meet. - Stop Rahim! Forbidden. Now why would you say such a thing. Kader, make two teas, I'm coming. - I said it's forbidden. - But why? Because now there's a border. Mehdi, what a beautiful Customs building it is that you've built. And what a beautiful borderline it is that you drew. So straight. - Take your leg in. - What a beautiful barbed wire... ...you have put up. - What's that? And we won't be able to pass, is that so? - No. Just take that foot in. - You mean we won't be able... ...to visit each other? - That's it, but you may pass... ...if conditions prove favorable. - Look, there's Uncle Musta fa coming. - Won't he be able to pass? - What's this? - Tube of the water pipe. - In it goes. And what if you want to visit me? - Stop there, Daddy. Your passport! - What's happening? No passport. Have never known it. I'm taking bread to the children. As far as I understand, the conditions are not favorable for Uncle Musta fa. You understand so well. - Passport, Daddy. - I know no passport. Never seen it. Is this a new law? - Forbidden. - Forbidden? This is my path. I'm 70, been passing through here ever since I was a child. Are you... blocking my way? Say something. What's he say ing, any way? - Uncle Musta fa, it's forbidden. - I'll pass through. What are you doing? Are you blocking my way or what? - You need a passport. - Never heard about a passport. Uncle Musta fa you come with me, We'll go to my house, we'll have a talk, a friendly chat, so that's it. Adem! - Stop! It's forbidden. - What? - Passport. - Move over, bro', I'll pass. - It's forbidden. - Father! Father! - What did you want? - Call Mr. Mehdi, will you? - He's bus y. What did you want? - I'll pass, bro', that's all. - Did you perhaps have a passport? - Have a what? - What was your name, again? - Mahmut. That's my house over there. I'll go to my village. - No passport, no passage. - How do we get one? Ask your father. Move! - Forbidden, man. - Fucker, I'll push my foot into here. - Forbidden! - I'll put my ass, fucker. - Adem! - Why didn't you come? - Can't you see the wires, Adem? - There's the Customs gate. - Why haven't you passed from that? - Port, they said. Passport. Come with me, come. Mehdi, look, have you seen it? I'll put my foot through. - Take you feet back or else. - My foot is both here and there. Filiz. I'll talk with my father, Filiz, wait. - He doesn't let Filiz enter the village. - Does she have a passport? She doesn't. But Filiz is your daughter too, father. But the state is father to us all. That's why it has the last say. Filiz, my girl, move aside. Mehdi, look, I've put my back foot through the border. Do you see that, Mr. Director? They take us for naught. You're right. Even that nut case makes fun of us. - Forbidden bro. - I'll put my whole foot! We must act so as to be a warning to all the villagers. - What can we do? - We'll shoot him. - You don't mean it! - Yes, we'll do. Selami, be care ful or this won't turn out any good. - Take your foot back! - They're watching. My leg goes over the border duty-free. They're all watching... Take care, son, or I'll shoot! It's my fault no more, take aim. - Will your father have him shot? - He won't, of course. - Put your leg in over there. - Now here, now there. Take aim. Director, shall I fire Director? - What's it that he doesn't have? - A passport. Shoot him now, shoot! - Do they shoot if you don't have it? - But of course not. - Shoot now. - Fire!! - My foot!! - They do, it seems. Father... I'll marry Adem. Director, a truck is coming towards the border, Director. Run away, it's coming toward us. Will this border pass from here exactly, Mehdi? - Yes. - Then could I never pass... ...as Turkish citizen? - You can't. - But who can hinder it? - Me. And who are you, Mehdi? You are my friend. I'm a civil servant putting Ankara's decisions into practice. Let's say my daughter is pregnant, can't she pass to the other side, ...to the health center? - Why don't you understand? I'm say ing The Capital, you're talking of health center. Congratulations to you then. You'll have an illegal grandchild... in a foreign country. My grandchild, in a foreign country and illegal, I swear they'll banish me. One, two, three, four... You came and put a wire in this ancient Hislihisar of ours. - I didn't t, the state did. - So why didn't you... ...resist? - Somebody else would have done it. We put it to protect the borders of the country. And how well you protect it! From poor Selami the Nut, from Rahim. I can't see my friends. - Make chickpeas with plenty of meat. - As if there was meat. - adiye, how's math? - As if there was a teacher. Draw a border, leave the sheep at the other side and then ask for meat. - Mr. Director, what are they say ing? - Just you wait, I'll get it. - What the hell is he say ing? - Couldn't get a thing. Could he perhaps be say ing something bad, about the state, our father? Could be. Will everyone come just like that and pass through? Goods will go in... ...go out, eh? Who are we then, what's Customs for? You can't... circulate freely. Customs is very important. It protects... ...international economy. What's freedom any way? We won't let you free, man. Cut it out. Move on. Muza ffer, come, we couldn't cheat the guy. I'll fuck... ...your Customs. Here. Say something, don't be a fraid. We won't pass from here anymore, we'll pass from over there. God willing. All right. It's over and done with. Filiz, this ring belonged to my mother's mother. I asked if I'll give it to you, she said yeah. Give me your hand. - Did you like it? - It's beautiful. - It becomes you very much. - Yes, very much. - I want you so. - Me, too. The thorns hurt. They really hurt. It hurts. - The gendarme! - Filiz. - What's wrong? - What are you doing here? - We were making love. - Forbidden. - Is making love also forbidden? - There's violation of the border. - What? - Your hand goes through... ...as well as something else. Adem. - Look, Hamdi, I'll tell my father... ...mind you. - It's your father's orders any way. Go away! - What s up? - Open it up, I'll pass. - With what? - Here's the passport. - Is this a passport? - Yes, my Director. Yes, passport. What a beautiful passport you have. Here, take it. - Open up, I'll pass. - Open up, son. Look how nice he passes. Close it, sonny. - Just a moment, Mehdi. - What s up? - I'll pass through again. - Do you think this a freeway? - I have a passport and I'll pass. - Open up son. He keeps going back and forth every minute, what'll we do? - Mehdi. - What? - I'll pass once more. - Mahmut, what time is it? - Five o clock Director, sir. - Working hours are over... ...you can't pass. - What shall I do in a foreign country? As if I care. Mehdi, congratulations, you have another border now. - Where? - Here. - You can't pass from there to here. - Why not, I have a passport. - Our marriage certificate. - It's not valid. Go to Ankara. Solve the problem or else forget about me. What's up, Director sir, why are you here at this hour? - Or have we been at fault somehow? - Nothing of the sort. Had a little... ...argument with the missus. - I'm sorry, it's private... ...except my apologies. - Mahmut, can't we give a permit... for this Rahim and his family? But you know, Director, It's against the regulations. Rahim is my oldest friend. My friend since childhood. If I knew that fate would thus separate us, I wouldn't have... ...accepted this post. I'm thinking of resigning. You are a great big Customs Director! You don't leave such a post! I took two people as examples in life. One is my father, the other is you. We were born civil servants, and will die as civil servants, Director Sir. - Rahim! - Yes? - Rahim? - Who's there? It's me, Mehdi. Come here for a moment. - Come. - Why should I? - Let's talk. - About what? Rahim, let's bring the two families together, find a way. - Is that so? - Yeah. - I'll come and we'll talk. - No. Shall we come to you, or will you come to us? - Neither. - Then how do we talk? What's up, Mehdi? We came here to sit and reach an agreement. - And how, I wonder. - Rahim don't be stubborn. - Go and take this passport. - Of course, why not... ...they're distributing them right here. I have something for you! Hey, Adem. adiye, Cemil. How many times need I tell you? Hey, catch that sheep. Stop! Where's your pass? You cannot run around without an official permit. Take it to the Customs Depot and fill out the forms. Yes, sir. He's coming, he's coming. Cut off the barter. Don't commit violation of the border, son. Rahim let's not sit here... ...if we'll trample down the customs border, or shall we? Congratulations Mehdi, if it weren't for you who would've caught these... ...creatures? Thank God you're here to put states on peace ful terms. I'm the state, Rahim. Will you tell on me to me? Humans may err, you are the State, so God will accept. God's merciful, - God will forgive you, hope fully. - Just think now. What would have... - happened if there were no state? - What would have, now? What? What? Am I not right. You're a big director, just look what you're doing. What do these couple of barbed wires serve, except puncturing us? Did you need to go to Ankara and get trained for this? For God's sake! My father sent you to school, you couldn't finish it... ...I did. You're jealous, of course, and ignorant. - You can't understand what state is. - Why shouldn't I, am I you? You idiot. The state protects a person's belongings... ...his life, his chastity and honor. I mean, it's something like me. But your state has not protected my chastity and honor. Your son's sperms have passed through the borders of my daughter. What? What do you mean? Hood, hey you Hood, you did have a passport, didn't t you? Yeah. Pass over this evening, I'll be your host. - What's up Rahim, bro? - Something good is up, Hood. O.K., I will. Since I'm coming, is there anything you want from this side? Yes, there is. I'm looking for a fine young man... ...to make my daughter s husband. Is that so? So you will give your daughter to me, Rahim? - Yes, it's you I've chosen. - So what happened to Adem? Adem is Mehdi's son, I won't give my daughter to his son. So you won't give her to the son of a great big director, but to me. That great big director of yours can't go to pee... ...be fore asking the Ministry of Customs first. O.K. Then, I'll come this evening. Mr. Mehdi! I know you're in there, you've heard what I've said. Why don't you come out? You've shut yourself in that building like a woman and can't come up to say a couple of words, you coward. Rahim. Yes, what's it? Since we're friends no more, take Napoleon. Give him his horse. We wrote Napoleon in the inventory. Napoleon is now the state's horse. - You can't give him. - Is that so? That's so. Take the horse back. Napoleon belongs to the state, I don't belong to my self. I also belong to the state. What's le ft, then? Nothing. Son, why don t you eat? - Father, I'll abduct Filiz. - Where to? - We'll go to Colorado together. - Where's Colorado? - In America. - So, what'll you do there? There are motor factories, I'll get a good job. You can't take two steps without a passport... ...how will you go to Colorado? - You need a passport every where? - Every where. - Mr. Rahim. - Welcome, Hood. - I came on time, didn't t I? - I'll have a couple of words with you. Filiz, so you decided to marry me! Good for you. And whom would you marry but the friend of great big Ismet Pasha? Don't fly high, Hood, come over here. You know what? You've done a good job, giving your daughter to me. - I haven't yet, we'll talk. - You know, I have... ...influential friends in Ankara. - Yes, that's a fact. As for Hislihisar, we're well off here, thanks to God. Then who but me... ...can satis fy your daughter? - Yes, yes, be patient, bro. Rahim, from now on I'll call you father. Well, thanks a lot, you can alway s call me father, but let's talk first. - What else shall we talk about? - Wait, will you. Rahim, it's such a famous song, New York, New York. - Yes, from the suburbs of New York. - Will you dance with me, please? Woman, get off, now's no time to dance. Sonny bring some raki to us, let's drink and eat something. Filiz, girlie, what have you done? Why did you run away? Did the gendarmerie see you? Come here. Damn, everything is destroyed. I was going to abduct you any way. I've talked to my father today. I have to go to Ankara. No other passage. I have to get a passport. Why did you run away just now? Would the child wait for Ankara's orders to be born? Lt'll get bigger, I'll be the laughing stock of the town. Yaar came to ask for my hand. I've passed through the wires. The gendarmerie were a fter me. Come on. Isn't this the house of Mr. Mehdi, the Customs Director? - Yes, it is. - Then she can't be here. - Just do your duty. - All right then, you come with me. Upstairs, upstairs, go through the roof. Look at the woodshed. The criminal is here, find her. Yes, Mr. Adem, now we'll get you. Mr. Mehdi, Director. Mr. Mehdi, traces of the runaway were found on the wires. What runaway? You to the right. - What the hell? - They say there's a runaway. Father! You bastard! - It's over with my service register. - What happened, Mehdi? - What do I say to Ankara? - Whatever has happened? - Filiz is with Adem. - What? Don't say anything to the gendarmerie. We couldn't find her. There's only this room le ft. - She's not here, either, Commissar. - Where can I find her? How do I know? It's not good that my father saw us. We have to leave immediately. - Mahmut is outside. - Shit! - Director, the runaway is here. - Get her! - Adem! - Stop, what are you doing? Father! Father, do something! Father, say something! Adem, Adem! Let me go! Adem, you can't help her. Leave that to me. You'll learn the rules of Customs organization. My favorite flower is the thorn in the mountains, my favorite animal... ...is the camel in the desert. - But why? I would be as strong as they are. I have an upset stomach. - And no hope le ft. - Don't worry Filiz. They can't hold you here, can they? You're no murderer... no thie f. You'll see, our child will also be born, please don't be anxious. Look, just you look at me, smile. I miss you. Everything will be fine. Filiz! Filiz., I'll tell you something. I wasn't going to give you to Yaar, child. - I know. - I did that just to... I know, I know, I know. Father, I m not angry with you. Open sesame. Oh, hello, citizens of the sister country! How are you, are you well? Father, please don't ever! Filiz don't you worry a bit. Neither you, father. I'll go to Ismet Pasha, maybe he'll come here himself? And Mehdi will get blue in the face. Don't you be a fraid. Yaar is your support. Now I'll go and have a couple of words with Mehdi. - B ye bye. - May you go, but never come back! So long, I'm going to my own country. In God s name, there's nothing like one s own country. The very esteemed Director of Customs, Mr. Mehdi, you've made... ...an grievous mistake. You are unaware and... ...led astray. - What's that? Well, you have arrested the fiance of Yaar Mertolu... ...the extraordinary figure of Hislihisar. - Buzz off be fore I arrest you, too. - Send Filiz to her country... ...be fore Ismet Pasha hears of this. I swear no one else will know. - Soldiers, take him away. - I forgive you. I'll take Filiz... ...to her country and marry her. Filiz, girlie, why did they throw you in here? Because I've violated the border. I've committed a crime, Adem, my love. Just wait, I have an idea. - Father, arrest me too. - Why's that? I have committed an ideological crime. - What's that? - I'm thinking bad things about the... ...state and Customs. - Look what we've brought you. Don't be a fraid. Osman, take these to Filiz. Mr. Director, they're violating the border. Just now there was something in their hands, now there's nothing. - Don't let them smuggle things. - Could be. Go in and take a look. Take this, child, and give it to her. - Mr. Director, just as I thought. - You don't say. It's like state provisions office. We have to shoot anyone getting close. - Then do what you have to do. - Soldiers. Aren't you going to arrest me? What's that, move over, move, you geezers. Mr. Rahim, take those and move away from the border. - What if we don't go? - I'll order them to shoot you. - Do, then. - Attention! Take aim! - Father, don't worry. I'm fine. - Pull this away, will you? Let's go. We've only a life le ft to us, let them take that too. Father, let's go. You are Turkish soldiers. You can't point your guns at Turkish citizens. This is wrong, Turkish soldiers can't shoot Turks. It's written in no law, what the hell is this? This is your country. Do you think what you're doing is right. You two, don't go any where. Move. - My mother has le ft the house. - Le ft for where? - For Sarkam, for my aunt's. - Where did she run to, I said? Mehdi, take a look at Customs Law, see what civil servants do when - their wives run away. - Turks don't carry propaganda... ...against Turks. This is our country, we have saved it and now... ...you don't let us pass through here. You are making propaganda against us. Shit. Why have you let her, you idiot, why have you? Come, mother. Father is nuts. Maybe this will bring him to his senses. He deserves it all. Don't be sad. You wouldn't have lived through these if you had a passport. But they don't give passports to everybody. You must know some people in Ankara. People of high position... ...isn't that so? - But of course. They don't give the state's documents to anybody. What happened, Mr. Adem? You're not answering me. Well, whatever, the bird has flown from the nest. Didn't Rahim come... ...to me and say, please save me from this sluggish Adem. Didn't he come right here and cry "Come and take Filiz?" Why don't you give up running a fter Filiz and worry about your mother? Since she has le ft Mehdi, she should have found... ...someone better, hasn't she? Never talk about my parents, or Filiz again. - Do you understand? - Hey, hey, let go! Help! ahane. Wait here, Napoleon. ahane, get off. You've made a laughing stock out of me. Get off that train. Why are you looking? Don't look at her, either. She's my wife. Don't look at me either, look in front. I was his wife, be fore he pre ferred customs to me. He forgot about all of us. Go to Ankara and take away this... - wire in the middle of the village. - Ankara, Ankara... ...Ankara, oh so lovely Get off the train for the children's sake. We're getting late because of you. - Adem, are you hurt? - It's forbidden to shout. It's forbidden to talk with the prisoner. - Hamdi. - It's forbidden to talk. Filiz, sis, you look like my fiance in my village. We used to swim in streams. I miss her very much. - She just looks like you. - Then take this to your fiance. A Turkish soldier can't be bribed. I'm giving it to your fiance. She isn't a soldier, is she? Yes, to my fiance, isn't it? Hey, this is much too valuable. I owe you for this. But I don't have money. Money isn't everything. You do me a favor and that's that. - What sort of favor? - I want to talk to Adem. Just give him that message. I love you. I love you. I want to touch you. I want to kiss you. I love you. O.K. But don't shout it from here. - What s up Hamdi? - She say s, well done for beating... ...that brute, the Hood. I miss you. I want to embrace you, to touch you. I'm not a fraid at all. I love you. I love you. I love you... - Say it again. - I love you. I love you. I love you... I know you're not a fraid. I love you, too. Those were the loveliest words I've heard, Hamdi. Say them again. Adem, I want to kiss you. I want to nuzzle you. I want to caress you. - What? - Well, Adem, haven't I told you? - I love you. I love you... - You've said something else, too. I want to caress you. I want to nuzzle you. I want to kiss you. Wonderful. Thanks, Hamdi. We're coming nearer to the town, don't make a laughing stock of me. ahane, someone's violated the border here. ahane, don t even think of it. ahane, stop, stop I say. Where are we going? There's only Rahim's house. Don t violate the border. Right now you have passed through the border. You re violating the law. You have kidnapped... ...my children. See if Rahim will accept you! I'll stay at Azamet's house. Either you include their house in here... ...or you write me off the book. I've waited 1 year for your appointment. I'll wait again. Go to Ankara and solve this problem. You have drawn this wire here, divided the village, become an enemy... ...of your friends, separated lovers. You have fucked everything up. Muharrem, you geezer! What shall we do? We've been... whiling away our time. You still haven't paid the rent. Come and I'll give you the money. - Lf I come there... - Come and get your money. When I come, I'll make you eat these words. You imagine through what. - What's up, Mr. Rahim? - Mahmut, my boy, please... help Mahmut, look, this man does not pay my rent. - You know I own the property. - It doesn't mean a thing. What should I own then for it to mean a thing? I'm getting angry. We're getting near the coffee house. Don't remind me of my official duty, ahane, or else! Even if he brought the money, he can't give it to you. - Why can't he? - Money is also subject to customs. - That, too? - Yes. - Mr. Rahim. - Hey, ahane, sis, Melek, adiye! How could you pass? Do you have a passport? You have passed the border, you have committed... ...a crime, but still I forgive you. Come to this side. Don't pass over the border. - What's that to you? - Passport. - Hey, girl, come over here. - You can't pass without a passport. - Don't violate the border. - What's that to you, any way? - Mahmut, what's he say ing? - You get yourself a passport, come... ...and I'll make you coffee. ahane passes over only when she wishes. She's my guest, you can't take her by force. We have both violated the borders of state! Don't lie to me! You have le ft your heard, and me my Adem. Did you hear me? ahane, ahane! Melek, adiye, come here. Melek, I'm calling your mother, why doesn't she come? - She doesn't. - How's your mother? - She's fine. - How are you, child? - Fine. - I've written to Ankara, I'll solve this problem. Tell your mother, will you... ...l've written a letter. adiye, how are you my girl? I'm fine, but my mother cries every morning. She cries? Tell her not to, I'll solve this problem. Come and... ...l'll kiss you, adiye, my beautiful daughter, come on. Go away now. Your father gave me this gun because you did not deserve it. I know you want it. I decided to give it to you be fore I leave. - Where are you going? - I'll find another country since... ...I can't enter mine. - You're going without your daughter? You'll give me my daughter in return for the gun. - I'm not authorized for that. - Yes, I know. But I have a right... ...to use this. Your father told me to use it in time of need. What are you doing, Rahim? Are you going to kill me? - Aren't we friends? - We were. But you put... ...a border between us. - I'm just doing my duty. And I'm doing my duty as a father. Now order them to bring the girl. If not, I'll use a gun once I take it out and you know it. - You can't do that, Rahim. - I will. In there is a girl... ...carry ing the baby of your son. She's my daughter. I'll take her and go far, far away. Now order them to bring the girl. Mahmut, bring the girl. - What's going on here? - Mahmut, bring Filiz. - But Director, sir. - Can't you see that I'm under... ...the threat of a gun? I've given the order, Rahim. But not because... ...l'm a fraid of you or death. It's because I really want it. Yes, that I know. - Filiz, what happened? - I don't know my self. - Your father has a gun. - Father? - It's all right. - Open the gate. Pass over. To the house. Do what I say. Pick your things! Now you can take this gun, Mehdi. And your dear father can rest... in peace in his grave. We've honored his will. - Filiz, you're free. Now what? - I don't know. Why did my father... tell me to pick my things up? And they've supposedly set me free. I think your father will go away from here. Filiz, listen to this. I've nothing le ft here. So what, father, I'll go! It's not possible to live here anymore. My mother... ...my sisters are all over there. Soon all the village will move. You haven't been a father to me. What have you done for me? Adem, shut up! - You don't scare me. - Don't leave me, Adem. Why should I stay here when all my loved ones are over there? - I don't love you, father. - Mehdi, don't. I've never been happ y since you came. Did you treat me like a father? - Pull yourself together. - All my loved ones are over there. I don't love you, father. Son, does it hurt? Call a doctor! There s no doctor on this side. Rahim then, call Rahim. He's on the other side. - We have to prepare a document. - What document? Pass permit. He can't pass without that. Then what would... ...your shooting your son mean? Son, I've shot you so you won't leave me, too. I wouldn't have le ft you any way, father. Open the gate, I'll treat the boy's wound. Get out of my way son. - Forbidden, without a passport. - Mehdi!! Write down. Rahim, he's writing. He's preparing the document. "A fter being shot, as the wound..." I'll take care of it. So you've brought it? - What's the situation? - He's still writing. Necessitated urgent intervention, it has been thus decided... ...to permit intervention. - It's O.K., child. I'm waiting for the pass. As the only medic in town is out of bounds. Mahmut, write quick, you geezer. When is this permit coming? The boy will go to waste in there. Director, sir, I haven't yet finished writing and this man has violated... ...our border! I'm sorry but I have to let Ankara know. - I couldn't stop him, Director, sir. - O.K., get out. Don't look at me like that, bring a bowl of hot water. Does it hurt, son? Take your hand away. Take your hand. Poor boy. - Thanks, father. - Not at all, son. Be brave, try to endure it, Adem. It's not too deep. I'm getting it, child. Thank God. I don't understand you. Your son is bleeding here, and you're having... ...a document written. This civil servant business has driven you crazy. Not service, but love of duty. And look, I've let you in be fore... the document was finished. And without a passport, too. Here's passport for you. Mother, get up and let's go to Uncle Rahim's. I'm not going be fore I see my boy coming sa fe and sound out of there. We'll come in the morning. I celebrate you for the success ful work of the Hislihisar Customs ...Directorate of the Turkish Republic. And I'm presenting you with this ...title in the name of my Ministry. Are you all right, Mr. Mehdi? Mr. Mehdi? Cemil! - How are you? - I'm fine. And you? Pass over to his side and let's play. - Won't my father get angry? Of course, it's forbidden to pass over. Father, can Cemil pass over here? I missed play ing. - adiye, when will you pass over? - When my father allows. - Why doesn't he? - He has written to Ankara ...and will allow when the reply comes. Why? I wish father let us pass, then we'd play. - That would've been great. - My teacher is over there, too. I will flunk this year. What happened to your hand? - It s scratched. - Right here? Well, since father has put up these wires. I wish the reply came, then we'll all be saved! - Come son. - Father, are you all right? Come. But Director, sir, even though he's your son, he's guilty of ...passing the border without a pass. - So what? I mean, if you're thinking of letting him go, it's a big crime. You're right. Come sonny. Bring the key of that storehouse. Open the door! But Director, sir, what about register of service? My son is more important to me than any register. Open, son. Son, open it! - What are they doing? - They're going. - Where to? - Where's he going, now? Rahim, stop! Rahim, where are you going? Soldiers! Open this door. Where are you going without me? Just look at me. I came to you naked. I'm over with civil service, and the directorate. We're... ...old friends. We'll win this war together. - We were in the War together. - Where are you going without me? Weren't we going away together, whereto without me? Colorado. America, have you forgotten? I can't leave my father like this. What about me? Can you leave me? I'm not someone as skilful as you. I can't circumcise... ...children. I can't even drive, can't do anything. I can't type. I had nothing else to do and decided to become a civil servant. My father was one, his father was one, so I became a civil servant. Ankara was our only hope. I went to Ankara to become... ...a civil servant. But now I'm no longer one. Look at me. I've been le ft alone with no state, no government, no superior... ...and no clerk. What shall I do now, Rahim? Show me a way. Dear Rahim, stop, Rahim. Take me with you. You'll catch cold like this. - Cemil! - Adem, just jump on if you want. Hamdi, I can see you. Open the door. Hey, look at him, he walks slowly. Be quick, come and open this door! I'm a civil servant with a future. I'll inform all of you to Ankara. I'll burn all of you to ashes! It's not locked, it's not locked. Pull from the bolt. You have acted slowly in doing your duty. I'll ask you all, you geezers. I'll ask you all. The truck is coming back. Soldiers, attention! Take aim standing! Fire! Fire! Isn't that our Uncle Rahim? Look, the truck is about to violate our border. Fire! Mr. Mehdi is coming toward us with a flag in hand. If you don't fire, you've legally committed a crime. Ramazan, Hamdi, shall we shoot? I'm telling you for the last time: You'll answer Ankara. Look here Hamdi, I can't shoot my own citizens. How can we fire at Mr. Mehdi? Then I'll apply the laws my self. Stop the order to fire! - I'm doing my duty. - A Turkish soldier doesn't fire... ...at the Turkish flag. - That truck cannot pass the border. You can't make us shoot our own citizens. Tell Ankara to stuff those papers! Stop Uncle Rahim! Mr. Mehdi! Don't come, Uncle Rahim!
