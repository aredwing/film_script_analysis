I use to laugh and have fun but within me it's completely empty- -except a black lump which just grows and grows. PONTUS: Don't bite! Are you angry with each other? No. Why do you ask that? Well... Now I will interview the foreign minister. Bye bye. Bye, dad. You begin early nowadays. -Dad! -Yes? You can have this at work... Thanks. Aren't you glad? -Of course I am. -I mean happy! Sweetheart... Hey... Yes? I thought we could... Perhaps we could... What? Nothing. -Tell me... -No, it's nothing. -Dad, when do you go off today? -Late. I forgot to tell mom. -We must go training today. -Not tonight. -But the game...? -What game? At the festival with the neighbours, tomorrow. Tomorrow? We agreed on buying new football shoes today. -Did you forget that also? -No, I didn't. Come to my work place after school, then we can go, and train tonight also. Bye bye. Stop reading now! Here are your clothes. Pontus, listen! Here are your... Come on! Pull yourself together now. Otherwise you'll be late to school. -I think dad is a bit overstrained. -Yes, he is always busy. -Bye bye, Alice! -Bye bye. Can you arrange a trip for christmas? To Turkey? Or the Canary Islands... We'll see. Don't forget to return this bag back home. Kiss. -God, how cute Anton is. -Look, look, look! Wow! -Such a little willy he has. -No, he hasn't. -Look! -And what are you doing? (TALKING IN A LOW VOICE) Alice, hi. Take this. What are you doing here? Aren't you in school? We have fun working together. She is nuts about her camera. -Why are you here? -We were going to buy football shoes. Damn, I forgot. And we were just going. Damn! I will fetch you at home at 5.30. Go home now, I'll come later. OK. OK? Bye. SCHOOL WELFARE OFFICER: Who's fault is it that you feel this way? Anna's. -Who is Anna? -A damn bitch. Is she a relative of yours? No, there is a guy in my class called Patrik. He is a bit strange. It's his mom, Anna. She is a photographer. She use to work with dad. -What has she done? -She has cheated him. -Cheated him out of money or what? -No, made him fall in love with her. LOTTA: Open your mouth, say something! Shout! Just don't be so quiet. I hate silence! What did he say then? He just shook his head, shut up and walked away. I go crazy. I receive no response. Perhaps I'm just imagining, do you remember last midsummer... Anna, the photographer, the neighbour. -Sometimes I imagine they... -Have you talked to Johan about it? Not since midsummer. I'm afraid of what he might say. They are working together and yet he becomes very strange when we meet all three of us. I guess I have become boring. What do you think? Have I? Yes... no. How about one more child? Johan has always wanted three. A little brother or sister to Pontus and Alice... -Yippie! We'll have a baby. -Alice, we were just talking... I would prefer a little sister but a little brother is fine too. -Get both! -We have to talk to dad. -You haven't said hello to Tina. -Hi. Tell me you will live with us. Please. I'm here to sell a horse and to visit your grandmom. I will leave tonight. I will make coffee. Alice, promise to bring mom and dad and visit me soon in Norway. -Promise? -Yes. I've got many new horses. I think you are going to like one of them very much. Alice... I saw you were standing there and heard much more than what mom knows about. But I know your parents... They are two very nice people who have experienced many good things together. Most of all, they have you and Pontus. So I think it will turn out just fine. Take care! -Say hello from me. -Promise to visit me soon. Say hello to the horses! Yes, and say hello to your dad. Damn! Hi, dad! (KNOCKING) Santa Claus... -Good afternoon. -Hello, Santa Claus. Let's see... Hi, dad! Come! Here you can take the boat all the way to Lido. Alice, there is the Realto bridge. There... Hello. -Hi. -Sorry I'm late. I tried to call but the damn mobile phone discharges itself. Nice isn't it...? -Are we celebrating something? -No. But what...? What's this? Nothing. What's the matter? Come on, what's the matter? Alice, pass the ball! Alice, pass the ball! Pass the ball! Can I...? Dad, pass the ball! Pass the ball, damn it! Professional! What a pro! -Stop, this is embarrassing. -But I'm so proud of you. -What a girl, eh? -Which one of them? -Do you want sausage? Mustard or ketchup? -Yes, both. -Did you see my goals? -Yes, you were better than the boys. -Weren't you? -Mmm, you're the best. Go and help dad with the sausages. -I think she... -Doesn't everyone believe that here? My god! The ball! Johan, very clumsy! It's perhaps for the best. We can't go on like this anymore. -It's not really the right situation... -It never is. But I don't want it like this anymore. I'm so terribly ashamed! You must choose now. Today you must choose...tonight... -No, tonight? Yes, it's either this or that, no more "both". Bye. Patrik! I don't want to be here anymore. Do you understand? I'm not taking this anymore. -Here, dad! -No, I'm tired. -Here are dad's... -There is no room for them. Dad, dad... May I? Of course you may. Yes, go at it. And the back too. It gets in my eyes. Do you love mom? We are married... mom and I. And we love our children. Can't we have a baby then? Dad, please... 'Who has been in my bed', papa Ruff said- -'when he saw that neither the pillow or the quilt lied where they used to.' 'Who has been in my bed', mama Muff said, who found her bed in disorder. In little Tusse's bed Goldlock slept. She heard the voices of the bears and dreamt that Ruff's voice was the thunder. And mama Muff's voice made her dream about murmuring brooks. But suddenly she heard a high squeaky voice... -Mom... -Not now. I'll sit here a little while. Go out and close the door. May I have a piece of cake? Do you also want? Please... -What are you doing? -I thought we could have a cosy evening. -Cosy evening? -I said it's alright. -You said "cosy evening"? -No, I said she could have a piece of cake. I don't need any. I thought you also wanted some. Good night, dear mom. Good night, dear dad. How long has this been going on? Answer me! How long? Stop! LOTTA: Don't run away! Answer me! Tell me! (A DOOR CLOSES) Answer me damn it! I'm asking you how long this has been going on. It's not only since midsummer, but since spring, isn't it?. So that's why we couldn't go on vacation this summer- -because you wanted to be close to her so that you could fuck her all summer! How are the children going to find out? Look, dad fiddles on other women in front of the neighbours! -If you won't tell, I will! -We agreed to be careful with the children. Have you been careful with them when you've been fucking that hore? Pig! You fucking pig! If you don't tell them tomorrow... -Shall you or me? -I will. Everything then! Everything! You will tell them everything. If you forget something, I will tell them. They will know exactly what kind of father they have! JOHAN: I can't stand this shit anymore. (THE FRONT DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS) (WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT THEY ARE SAYING) JOHAN: What the hell, Lotta? Are you crazy? Are you crazy!? ANNA: Johan, she could have killed us. I can't live here anymore. What the hell is she doing to my home? -Are you OK? -No! Mom. How are you? Mom... -Are you awake? -Why are you crying? It was such a horrible dream. Go to bed now. -What did you dream? -If I tell you, you can't sleep either. Tomorrow. Good night. -Dear mom! I love you. -Yes, you do, don't you? Yes, a hundred million thousand times. -What are you doing up this late? -I just woke up. -Can I sleep with you? -Not tonight. Go to bed. -Please, just like when I was little. -To me you may. Dad, please! You are the world's greatest dad if I may. -No! -Don't shout! What the hell are you doing? Don't you understand what you could have done? It's a pity I missed, but there will be more chances. -What are you talking about? -Ask dad. What are you talking about? Alice, come and lie next to me. Let's lie here together. -Won't you undress? -No, it's so cold here. Come, let's warm up each other. -Hi. -I will not come today. Are you sick? No, mom asked me to stay home today. Bye. Alice, sit here. Dad has something to tell. -So, go ahead! -Thanks. As you surely have noticed, mom and I... ...we have... Damn! Do you want to think it over? I get some coffee so we can talk... No! OK, then. What are you waiting for? I want to talk to them individually. I want to talk to you, Alice, and... -...you, Pontus. -Then I will tell them. -Dad has met someone... -No, stop it! As you...well, mom and I have quarrelled a lot lately. As you have noticed. And we don't know how to solve this. We become sad about this, we can't stand to have it like this... You become sad too. So I believe that the only thing we can do now- -because we have tried to solve this... I think we should live in separate places. So you will take turns to be with us. It's dad who wants to divorce. It's he who wants to move out. But I want to be here, to live here with you, but it's not working how things are now. Tell them where you are going to live. I think it's better if mom lives here with you. Then I will live nearby so that you can be with me- -and be with mom and then you can run between us. Such a little idyll! Tell them who you are going to live with. -It's perhaps not the right moment... -What's her name? When I was... When I was very sad- -then I met someone who... Because mom and I can't talk and comfort each other anymore. We can't. Then...I met a woman who I like, and feel good to be with- -and she also liked being with me. And we have met for a while now and you also know who it is. She has been here eating and I... She lives just here nearby... Anna, in the green house. Who is mother to Patrik. You know... Patrik. -What are you doing? -Dad will be a father to Patrik. Stop, damn it! I will not be a father to Patrik. -Dad will get a new family. -Stop it. -Alice... -Yes? Are we also going to divorce? I don't know, but dad will probably soon find out what a damn bitch she is. SCHOOL WELFARE OFFICER: But what does mom say about this? That's what bothersome about it. She just cries every night. Does you dad live with you now...? No, he has moved out. ALL: Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! ANTON: Stop! Damn, stop it! -Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! -Is it that hard? Stop! Alice and Hanna, stop it! Can't you hear what I'm saying? Enough! That was the third time this week. What the hell are you doing? -Grown-ups shouldn't teach children to swear. -Should children do whatever they like? You both have always been best friends. What happened? Alice, we are going to solve this now. -Hanna lies about me in front of the others. -No, I don't. -What are you saying then, Hanna? -Alice's dad has moved out. -No! -Yes! -Hanna, where does your dad live? -In Gothenburg with his new wife. OK, that's the way it is then because you should know. -And Alice, where does your dad live? -At home, but right now he is travelling. OK, that's the way it is then because you should know. Do you understand, Hanna? (THE BELL RINGS) -All for today. -Alice... -Mmm... If you have something on your mind... If you have problems, you can talk to me. -Is there anything you want to tell me? -No thanks. Bye. Alice, do you know if Patrik is still at school? -What's the time? -3.30. I must go and look if Patrik is at school. I take the bike. Alice...may we be at your place today? I brought my brother's new demo. I don't know. Mom and dad are not here. You have your own key, don't you? (WHISPERING) You are not allowed to be there. Newly cleaned! You can only be in my room. Can't we visit the bathroom...? Of course. Come here, I want to talk to you alone. Moa, hurry up! Hanna! You fucking bastard! You bloody damn mean pussy! Let me out! Let me out! -Why are your dad's desk empty? -Because... we will re-paint. -Why are all the clothes gone? -He is wearing them when travelling. -Your dad doesn't live here anymore. -Yes he does! -They have divorced. -No! You're lying, lying! PATRlK: Look! This is the other one. ANNA: We only have the car today. We must do it now. Because we will leave in an hour. Alice! - Patrik, bicycle home before me. I must... -Alice! Alice, wait for me! Perhaps I can help you. Alice, listen! Come on, Alice! Listen to me! Alice! Hello! I will kill you. Everything is your fault! Everything! Damn bitch! -I understand. Listen, Alice. -It's your fault! My dear... -I hate you. -Yes, I understand that. Let me talk a little. Let me help you a little. I must tell you some things. Oh, dear. This is difficult. It's not what you think. Or, well... oh my dear child. -Alice! -Lotta, look! Yes, but your dad hasn't choosed between you and me, Alice. He loves me, and you, very much. Not me. Yes, he does. He talks about you all the time. He misses you and your little brother so much it hurts. -It serves him right. -Why are you saying that? Because it serves him right. He is full of shit. -You don't mean that. -You don't know what I mean. No, that's true... I don't know you that well yet. But I have seen you and your dad. It's obvious how close you are together. Hey... -''Full of shit.'' Who said that to you? -Not mom, if you think so. -I don't think of anything about your mom. -Yes, you do! But mom never talks shit about dad, as dad does about mom. -I have never heard him do that. -Then you apparently have a bad hearing. Yes, perhaps I have. I know only that your dad tries to do everything to make this work. -So does mom. -Good, then there is no need to make a fuss. I have met your mom and she seems to me a very good mom. Alice! Down! -Alice, why are you doing this? -She will kill you if she sees you. No, don't worry. She will not do that. -Alice! -Alice! Mom! Alice, where have you been? Where have you been? Do you have to run into the woods like that? I become so worried when you disappear. Call your parents and ask if you may. The phone is there to the left. -Why don't you ask me first? -Because you would have said no. -I know what's best for you. -They have been very mean. You haven't told the truth. Dad should be ashamed, not you. Let's do something fun now. (MUSlC IN HIGH VOLUME) Then you may have them. Take the cucumber as well. (THE PHONE IS RINGING) I take it. -Yes, this is Alice. -Hi honey, it's me. -How are you? -Fine. Where are you? -Can you lower down a bit? -We are having a girls dinner. What are you doing? I'm down here at Anna's. I'm helping her moving out. She called and told me you are sad. She was worried about you. Are you worried? -Alice... -I long for you so much. I can see you. Do you see me? I'm waving... Hi. Yes, I see you. Can't we meet quickly? I have to see you. It's mom's days But we can ask for five minutes... -It's dad. Can we meet? -We are having guests. He has to call later. -Mom says you have to call... -I hear, tell her I want to talk for a minute. -He only wants to talk for a minute. -I'm cooking. -Mom says she is cooking. -God damn it! Sorry. Sorry, Alice. Tell her that I want to talk to her for 30 seconds, just one thing. -Just one question, mom! -After the dinner. -Mom says... -I have to... ...see you, just for a minute. Tell her that you are going to the toilet, anything. -Can't we do that? -Time to eat. Say goodbye. -OK, dad! Call tomorrow. -Finally! I have to go to the toilet. It will go quickly. Dad... -I think of y ou and Pontus all the time. -And I think of you, dad. But... couldn't I have an old t-shirt? -What for? -Put it on me when thinking of you. -Thanks. -You are welcome. Please, can't you and mom be together again? I have to go now. -Bye bye. -Bye. Let's go out and talk a little. Let's sit here. I notice that you are not feeling well. If you want to talk about it then we can do it. Or we could just sit here in silence and think. Then I guess I should be heading back to the others. I lied to you. Mom and dad have divorced. I know. I understand why you couldn't say how it was. You do? When I was just as old as you are now, I experienced the same thing. I had so many questions but nobody to talk to. Tell me how you feel. THE SCHOOL WELFARE OFFICE: Do you sympathize more with mom than with dad? No, but dad seems more happy with that... Anna. But mom, she has nobody. She is completely alone. -Perhaps she has met someone. -No, never! -But when you are in school... -No. -Maybe. -No! -She may find someone to marry. -She won't. Mom is not like dad. But wouldn't it be good if mom becomes happy that way? Yes, but she only becomes glad if dad comes to her. She loves dad so much... she doesn't know what to do. And dad will understand. He will leave that Anna and come back. I'm sure. -Alice! -Hi. -Was it a good conversation? -It's only between me and her. I'm not asking what you were talking about. I just wonder how you feel now. -Oh, sorry. -Don't worry. It feels like... easier to breathe. Let's ignore that repulsive school food. How about a hamburger? Yes! Pasta, tomatoes... -Celery... -Yes, that's it. (WE CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING) No, mom, we forgot the onion. Over here... -I will just take a melon first. -No, I can take... But mom... Are you finished, mom? -No, wait! -I will... Stay here. Lotta, calm down now. There is one thing I want you to understand. But hey, do you understand? Haven't you? Stop it! Run, Patrik! What's she doing? Why is she doing that? Is she always like this? ...and then we hit a nail there. Then there is Titanic. OK? -I know... the Eiffel tower! -We can do that one also. Find a warmer jacket, Alice. Please, can you wait further away? A bit further away... No, but do you think that it's necessary to become enemies? -It's now you are needed as grandmother. -That's right! But you have abandoned them. You can't just tramp in here, as if the house was still yours. What are you saying? It's mine. I pay all the bills! It's Lotta I have divorced, not the children! Yeah right, you want everything I can tell! To eat the cookie and keep it. -Aren't you happy with your new family? -Yes, damn happy! Can't you be satisfied with that then? What the hell are you saying? What should I do with the children? -Leave them alone. -Is this a grandmother who says so? Drudge them with you each second weekend then, because you have the legal rights. -You should be ashamed, Johan Lindberg! -Who the hell should be ashamed? -Henry was in a similar situation. -Yes, but he left the children alone. -Life is what it is! -He left the children alone. -That you were damn glad of. -No. I wasn't. -How are those children? -They have good contact now as grown-ups. I have talked to them. I know what kind of contact they have with you two. -I'm not discussing my private life. -But it obviously is alright discussing mine! -I don't want to talk about mine. -Please, Sonya! SONYA: Alice, don't bring such a thin jacket. You must have a thicker jacket. -Wasn't you too harsch? -I know, I just became so furious. We have been good friends for many years now. Thanks, mom. -Do you have an Alvedone? -Yes, in my bag over there. Say goodbye to grandma and grandpa. -Bye, Alice, take care. -Bye bye, grandma. -Bye bye, grandpa. -Say hello to dad from me! I will. Remember dad promised you to be alone. Call if there is anything. Then I will come. -Do you hate dad? -No, I love him. It's he who doesn't want us. Come. You should stay home on the holiday, but go with dad, otherwise there will be trouble. -Will you be with grandma and grandpa? -No, they are invited out. Bye bye. -I'll call tonight. -Do that, call as much as you want. -Have you checked him? -Wait, dad! -I must give mom a hug. -But you just... I just must hug mom! But, Alice, what's the matter? -Bye bye. -Bye bye. Call when you arrive. I'm here all the time. JOHAN: OK? You have promised us to be alone. If she will be there then mom will fetch me immediately. Let's go now. Now we are really in a hurry. Come on! -Faster, dad. -Soon there. Voil, willkommen, bienvenue... -Welcome home. -This is not my home. Yes, it's mine and then it's yours. - And yours. It's ours. -My home is with mom. -But, Alice, give me a break now. Come and look, it's very nice. We rent it all autumn, then we'll see what... what we will do. This works. Let's light a fire, grill sausages and... -I don't eat sausages. -You don't eat sausages? Why? I'm a vegetarian. But you love sausages! Since when are you a vegetarian? Since last week, when we saw how they how thay feed pigs, in school... It's perhaps not nice to look at, but vegetarian... it... Don't jump on the sofa! Take off your shoes! You can't be a vegetarian now. You are only 12 years old and growing up... -Mom has already said yes. -She has? This is a thing that parents decide together. But now I'm a vegetarian or will you force me to eat meet? Dad, what's this? I have quit. Almost. -I don't want you to die. -I will not die for a long time. I think I want to die before you, Pontus and mom. You don't have to say things like that. None of us will die for a long time. We live together all the time, we just... live in different places. Everything is just the same, Alice. -No, some more. -But I have finished. -A little more. -I have finished. -Brush a little more! -No! But dad... Open! ''The little fisherman didn't care to listen to the one who lied to him.'' ''Soon the men could on the beach neither see him nor the white stallion.'' ''They swam a long time.''- -''and the white stallion who had inexhaustible powers''- -''took Folco with him to a wonderful island''- -''where children and horses always are friends.'' Dad! (FAINT SOUND IN THE NEXT ROOM) Hello and good morning. Have you slept well? -When did you arrive? -Just now, with the morning ferry. Newbaked buns! What the hell are you doing here? I live here. What do you think about my pictures? I will have them on an exhibition now. It's dad who lives here. Yes, and me and Patrik. And you and Pontus, as often as you like. We live with my mom. -Where is dad? -He is... -Here I am, up with the rooster. -I want to talk to you, alone... Haven't you told that I will come here? No, I... I was just going to. -Where is Patrik? -In the cabin in the woods. Take it easy now. Sorry, Alice. -You... -You damn liar! I didn't know what to do, because I was afraid that- -mom would be angry if I told her that Anna will be here. I was afraid that she wouldn't allow you to come here. And that's why I didn't say anything, but I was just going to tell when Anna came. -But I understand... -Not a fucking thing! You only care about yourself. You give a damn about me! I don't know what to do. I just want everyone to be happy. I don't want to be here. I want to go home to mom. But you just came here. Can't we be here a couple of days now, then, and... -Only a couple of days and then... -Don't touch me! -But my dear... -Don't touch me! Then I think we will take this walk after all. Honey... Everything will be alright. It will be fine. We just have to give her time. One gets completely shocked. To see such a bitch like me! I go out. I do it. Look now! Well, now it must happen... I go out with the boots and the stuff to her. Then you can dress Pontus and we will leave. Damn, it shouldn't be like this. LOTTA: Hi, neither Johan, Lotta, Alice or Pontus can pick up the phone right now. Say anything you like and then we will call back as soon as possible. Bye. Why aren't you answering, mom? Where are you? I don't want to be here. Hurry, come here! Dad promised us to be alone, but the bitch is here. She is calling us bad words and dad just stands and watches. Call me! Alice, you will catch cold. Mom will not be glad if you come home sick. Come! OK, let's do this then. Yes! Wait... Yes! Goal! I put the boots here with a banana. Alice... We are going on an expedition. It would be fun if you join us. Patrik, come! -I will cut you when you are asleep. -No, it has to be this way. Show Pontus your hut in the woods. -Do you want to see it? Add to it a bit? You go ahead. ANNA: Careful! You see the ladder over there is a bit broken. Dad, let Patrik spin also. -Now I will chase Patrik. -No, I don't want to. -Don't you want? -No, let go! No, not me! Stop it! Stop it, Johan! Do you have to do this all the time. It's embarrassing! Why are you doing this? That was damn unnecessary. Sorry. But why are you doing this? -So many leaves... -What kind of man is this? Do you have to show everything? The children can't handle this. -I'm showing that I love you. -It's too early. -But it isn't forbidden? -Patrik, wait for me! True love in the woods... Let's go! - Patrik! Where did you come from? -From the sky I suppose. -Yes, it seems so. -Are we friends then? -Yes... -Sorry I yelled a bit. -Let's go on expedition. -Shall we go on expedition? -Ourselves. Aren't we going with them? Ourselves. We can go down to the beach ourselves. You and me? Can he also join? Yes. But...yes... Two! There is no speed... -We must do like this. -Well done, dad! -What? That is three. Did you see? -Yes. You can also do this. Higher, dad, higher! Higher! Higher! -I won! -That was the limit. -What's the matter? -Pee. -Don't forget to pull down the trousers. -Yes... How do you think he is handling everything with your mom and me and... He doesn't understand... Well, as you and me do. Alice... Have you called mom and told her that you... want to leave? -May I? -Of course you may. I want you to be here. Pontus and you. But you have to do as you like. Call mom. (THE TELEPHONE RINGS) -Yes, this is Alice. -You have one new message. LOTTA: How can you seduce the children to that slut? You promised to be alone. This is child abuse. The slut shall not infect my children. Alice calls and cries and screams. The children must come home now, otherwise I will report you! They must come home now! Otherwise you'll see what I can do! The message was received at 13:59. -Wow, that went fast. -Yes. And what decisions have we made? I stay. Thank you. -Will there be any food here? -No, there will be no food. -Yes, we will eat in 15 minutes. -You can taste my pancakes. Mother's are very delicious. -Don't pay attention to her. -I will make so delicious pancakes. -What have you done with the crispbread? -Puzzle! Hi. We will have pancakes you see. So, let's see... Damn! This is not a good frying pan, you see. I will just do this... I use to turn them in the air but now it doesn't work. This is how to show things. Then it usually doesn't work as well. Damn pancake! It gets stuck in the frying pan! It's that damn teflon surface! It becomes like this sometimes. Now you'll see... Those damn fucking pancakes! -Lie in your dad's bed. -That's my mom's. -No, it's actually my dad's. -Nothing here is his. Everything is mom's. -It's my dad's house. -Just as much my mom's! Hello there! What are you doing? One at a time! -What's the matter, Patrik? -I lied here first but must go. -Is this true, Alice? Yes, I actually want to rest a while and this is my dad's bed. -Come. -What is it? -I want to be alone. -Go out on the veranda then. If Patrik lies here then Alice must respect that. They must both respect that this is our bedroom. Period. -If you can't agree, then go out. -Shall Alice be allowed to throw Patrik out? -Be sensible regarding the sitation. -We are five who feel different. -I give a damn about this bed. -Me too! -Well, I'll be damned... -Yes, damn it! Can you be so kind and stop that! What? Creak, creak, creak... No. Time to eat! Come! -He thinks he desides over me. -She thinks she decides over me. -Only my dad decides over me. -But you don't have any. Are you stupid or what...? He is a woodcutter in Canada. He cuts so big trees that you can't find here. Look! Oh... They think they can decide over us, as we were little children. But we are actually 12 years old. Do you want them to be together? No. -What do you want then? -Everything to be as before. What do you want? I also want everything to be as before. Are you deaf? Come now, I said! -Incredibly delicious pancakes! -Thank you. -Aren't they, Alice? -Mmm... -What? I didn't hear. -Enormously delicious! Enormous! What the hell are you doing? She becomes sorry. She has been cooking this for you. Aren't the pancakes to your taste? What's wrong? What? Are you behaving like this at home? -Alice, are you doing this to your mother? -No, but she isn't my mother. Now, damn it... Don't you believe... -Don't believe, damn it... -What are you saying? I don't get it. Not me either. (MUSIC AND SINGING) (THE MUSIC CEASES) You just can't go away like this. Then you give up, then the children win. Do you mean that we must conquer them? Our own children? As a damn boxing match? I'm just saying that we must give them more time. You said it yourself. -Time and patience. -If someone has patience, then it's me. But how much shit do I have to take from your daughter? -Only Alice who is the problem? -No, Patrik also. But Alice is so loaded with bullshit from your damn ex wife. I get no chance. Can't you see how she studies every move you do? -You are a little sensitive now, aren't you? -You are blind, Johan. She hates me. -Then I'll say the same about Patrik. -Not a single bad word about my son! -You spit out shit about my daughter. -Damn you! -Damn yourself and your discontent. -Go home to your wife. You are still married. Then you can relax! Without any problems at all! Go home to her! Run out to the woods then, damn it! As all the others! Out! (THE FRONT DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS) -Are you sitting here by yourself? -I cannot go on any longer. -Go on what? -Pancake. But you don't have to eat any more pancakes. -I'm tired, I want to rest. -Go ahead then. Damn! Shit! Sleep well! He is watching you. -Good night. -Good night. Sleep well. Shall we do something funny tomorrow? Perhaps we should talk, you and me. Sleep well now. -Can't you sleep here with me? -No, I'll sleep in there. -Please... -No. You will sleep like a log. I know that. Alice, sorry I flared up before today. I'm just like that. If I become angry, then I become angry. But lots of goodies also. If I become glad, then I become glad also. I just want to say that I think you are such a nice girl. I will tell you a secret. Something not even Johan knows about yet. Before I got Patrik, I expected another child, a girl. The first time I felt her kicking inside my stomach- -then I knew immediately that this was a little Alice. I don't know why, i just knew. 'Her name will be Alice.' But when I was going to give birth then there was something wrong, so... she died. I still don't know what was the cause. Then I meet a wonderful man and she has a girl called Alice! Isn't it strange? That woodcutter... Was he her father also? Oh, Patrik... Does he lie? Never. It's just that... What is the truth for Patrik perhaps not always is the truth for others. His father and I had a rock band called Wood Machine. We had strange names back then. But his father didn't want to admit that Patrik is his son. He doesn't even want to talk to him. Patrik dreams about him all the time. Good night then, Alice. Sleep well. See you tomorrow. ANNA: Ouch! My God, how will this end? (GROANINGS) Pontus... There is a ghost in there. -I'm afraid, I want to sleep with daddy. -Come, I'll go with you. -Is the ghost here? -Maybe. We must be quiet. ANNA: God! -What are they doing? -They are dreaming. Go in and tell. Daddy, there is giant ghost in there with giant claws and giant teeth! -What? -A ghost... -A ghost? -Yes. -Why do you think it's a ghost? -Alice told me. I want to sleep here. -Here? -Yes. -Alice says... -Hmm... JOHAN: Well, we must go in and look for the little ghost then. (KNOCKING) (THUNDER) Daddy, daddy, daddy! There is someone out there. I get it! Scaring your little brother... There is someone out there. It's true. It's scarey. (KNOCKING) (KNOCKING) JOHAN: Yes, yes... -Hello, Johan. -Hello. -What are you doing here? -We came to collect the children. -In an easy manner, for the sake of the children.. -Collect? What are you saying? -Don't take it personal. -Are you making fun of me? -Grandma! -My dear. Now everything is okay. Don't be afraid anymore. -You must explain... -Put on your clothes, Alice. And help Pontus. We wait here. Now, tell your wife that she must tell me what the hell is going on. -Sonya, we can't just... -Henry, tell them now. -Johan... -Yes? Don't take it personal, but when your own daughter asks for help... Lotta was in despair when she heard Alice's cries for help. 'Cries for help?' Here is Lottas's phone. You can hear what Alice is saying. Johan, perhaps you should ask grandpa and grandma to walk in. -No. -Yes.-Welcome to our cottage. Hello, my name is Anna Solberg and I am Johan's wife. So far, isn't Lotta Johan's wife? Anna Solberg, Johans wife, that is. Welcome to the cottage. I'm Henry. -That was kind... -My husband is very polite. I like that in a man. In women as well. Patrik, my son. You were lucky who managed to avoid the rain. Yes, perhaps we can offer you a warming brandy?? -A small one. -Are you sure? -Nej, rather a big. -Yes, I have. Johan, now you hear yourself how Alice is with you. Sorry, dad, sorry. I didn't mean all that. I was just so sad and angru. You don't have to aplogize. You feel what you feel. -Where isr Lotta? -Does it matter? I want to talk to Lotta. Do you really have to answer in that way?! Absurd! You come in the middle of the night and pull up the kids who are sleeping. By consideration, if you recognize that word. Sonya lversen, and you talk about consideration? You don't know what consideration is, damn it. -Johan... -Damn! -Where is she? -Down at the bridge. Here...? Yes, we came by taxi boat. They are waiting to tack us back. Okay then... Perhaps it's better that we let Henry collect Lotta. Dad, I want to talk to you. Alone! Come! Well, perhaps we should also have a glass of brandy. -Only a little, thank you. -Woops. Sorry, a little too much perhaps. Cheers, then. For Alice! I don't want you to be sad. You are my dad. You must not cry. I'm not crying. Don't worry. Everything is my fault. No. Alice, nothing that happened is your fault. Yes, because I said what I said in the phone and now mom has come here for me. But... dad, look what I'm wearing. They are waiting for you now. What to say? Yes... No, let's go. You may go home this time. Yes, nothing more to it. but I want you to go too. -Shall really me and Patrik...? -I'm not going to stand on the quay for myself. They are coming now. Goodbye. Don't you want me to go there? No, you know...mom... Well, you get it. We'll not meet this weekend but the weeken after that, honey. -I call you tomorrow. -Yes. -Bye bye, Anna and Patrik. -Bye bye. Oh, my dear child! How I have longed for you. -How I have longed! -I have longed for you too! -Anything particular you are angry with? -That they are not listening. I love both mom and dad and want to be with both of them. But they always argue over the phone about where I should be and not be. What are you trying to say which they don't listen to? I don't want to feel myself as a letter which is thrown between two places. I want to feel secure wherever I am. LOTTA:Look! Do you remember we were fishing there last year? How nice! Hello! Welcome! Welcome! Oh, my God, so great to see you! -Have you been driving in a cab? Are you crazy? -The folding top broke down by the wind. Aren't you freezing? LOTTA: It's bigger. TlNA: Yes, I have added to it. LOTTA: And the stable, it smells so good. I can smell the horses. TlNA: No, Alice, here! LOTTA: Have you enlarged? TlNA: No... TlNA: There you see. I told you it was a long time ago you were here. Come in! Livingroom, bedroom and a small kitchen. Not fancy but clean and warm. LOTTA: Very nice! We will like it here. - Won't we, Alice? -I long for dad. -What? Isn't it beautiful? Come! Yes, very nice! All these horses came by sea from Iceland when they were 5-6 years old. -When can they return back home then? -This is their home. But to their parents. No, those who have travelled from Iceland can not go back. -Sometimes maybe. -No, those are the regulations. This is a mom. Her name is Fina. And her name is Stierna. -But the dads then? -No, they cannot see their dads again. No, Alice! No... damn. I didn't think about that. -Alice! The news. How can I help you? -Hi, I'm Alice Lindberg. -Hi there, Alice. Hi, I want to talk to dad. He is reporting in USA. -But I can't reach him. -He came back today. One moment.. Foreign editorial department, Johan Lindberg. Hello? Who is this? -Dad... -Is it Alice? My dear little girl, I have called and called both to the house and- -left lots of messages on mom's mobile phone. Where have you been? -Where are you? -In Norway. ln Norway?! What the hell are you doing in Norway? -Perhaps we will live here. -Tina wants to show you something. Come. Live in Norway? What are you saing? Mom and Tina will perhaps open a business together. And we will check if the school is good here. The children are hungry and tired. Alice can call you tonight. If you want something you can write a letter. -Why haven't you told me? -Dad has been away. -He has called lots of times. -I haven't talked to him. Let me see your mobile phone! -Why? -The incoming messages. Okay, he has called. He has called lots of times. But I can't take all the calls. I don't have the strength to talk to him. He has left us, Alice. He has a new family. We must build something new without him. How are we supposed to do it if he is interrupting us all the time? -Don't you want me to meet dad? -Of course, and Pontus too. But... he has hurt us so much, that we need to be alone for a while. When he calls like that he is only thinking of his own good, thinking of himself. If he was thinking about you, then he would leave you alone. He has bad conscience just because he left us. If he would think about your own good then he wouldn't force you- -to meet that woman and her son. Lotta... Perhaps the children should rest a little. You and me can cook something. -I'll just finish... -I want us to talk now. Let's go then. -Alice, help Pontus finding Dino. He is lying in there, Alice will help you. Tina and I will cook something first. We'll fetch you when the food is ready. - Will you help Pontus? Good. Bye then. I forgot my sweater in the car. I'll come back soon. LOTTA: You don't know how I have been. TlNA: I'm just saying 'take it easy'. LOTTA: 'Take it easy?' TlNA: Don't use the children as weapons. -I'm not. -Yes, you are, dear Lotta. I know that he has hurt you, but your behaviour is not hurting Johan- -but Alice... I hve to tell you how it is. She is old enough for the truth. Yes, she is old enough but still a child. Which truth by the way? -She is your daughter, not your friend. -Not you either in that case. Lotta, this is what I'm trying to be. It's not that damn easy for me! You called and told me that you and Johan had agreed. -Have you talked to Johan? -No. But if I had? You are my friends, both of you. Besides, I can't stand watching how you force me to choose side. -You already have. -Perhaps. But not your side and not Johan's, but the children's. I can't stand watching how you tare apart the relation that Alice have to her father. You really take care of him. Have you been together or something? Damn it all! Haven't you always looked at him? Perhaps you were fucking already back then. Did you? Is this the way you talk to everyone who has a different opinion regarding the children? Don't you talk to me about children. You stick to your damn horses! Listen to me! I'm sick and tired driving. I want to know where we are heading. If you don't answer I will scream! Shut up now! Understand? Do as I say! -Period, nothing more to it. -But that's no answer. Yes, a very good answer! If I say we are going, then we are. -But you don't know where to go. -Yes, I do. Okay, then. I don't know. But how am I supposed to know everything all the time? (SCREAMING) If it's okay that children may have an opinion, then Pontus wants to say something. I don't want to live in Norway. I want to go home. Oh, come... -I'm sorry for all the mess. -No problem! We continue... -Aren't we, Alice? -Mmm... Bye. -Hi! -Hi! Welcome. -Hi there! -Hi. -Hi, Alice! -Hi. -How did it feel coming back? -It went well. And... Patrik and I have come closer. And Anton...? And Anton and I have looked at eachother, but I don't know if he likes me. -Of course he does. -I hope so. PUPILS: Come on!, reds! Come on! OTHER PUPILS: Yellow, yellow, yellow! (WHISTLE) -My god, so handsome! -What did he say? -Did he kiss you? -Stop... Alice! -I know this is mom's week. -When did you see Patrik recently? Yesterday. What's the matter? Anna and Patrik quarrelled. He has been out here all night. Do you know where he can be? When they lived in the green housde he was often in cabins in the wood. Which wood? (EVERYBODY SCREAM 'PATRlK') Oh, my God, forgive me, Patrik, forgive me! What did I say? Patrik, forgive me. ...26, 27, 28, 29, 30. I know what you are thinking now, but perhaps nothing has happened. He can be somewhere else. But now let the professionals take over. Go diretly back home, all of you, so that not your parents will be worried too. -Dad... -Mom is over there.- Yes? -I will absolutely not... -Yes, absolutely! Let's go home. No more kids in the wood! I'll call as soon as we know more. -I can accompany Alilce back home. -Yes, that will be fine. Thank you. It's okay. Just one thing... I saw Anna said something to herself. 'Forgive me, Patrik, forgive me.' -What happened yesterday evening? -That's something between Patrik and her. Go home now. Hello. Go home... Can you wait a moment? Anna... Yes? -I think that Patrik will come back. -Do you? I hope so. I shouted that his father never would like to see him. Now hurry up to mom, and we will search. Hurry home. Thank you. Hello. -Tina! -Oh, dear... Hello, my big little favourite! -Is mom at home? -Yes. Do you think I may cmoe in? Yes, I may.- Hello, by the way. -Hello. Anton. -Tina. -Shall we try again then? -Yes. No... Lotta sat on the beach with Costas, and then Costas said to Lotta... He said Do you want some grass, he said to Lotta. -What did he say? -Do you want some grass? No, thank you, Lotta said. ln Sweden we do not eat grass I didn't say that. You have altered that. They sat on the lawn. On the lawn, yes... Thank you for the food. But will you... now, alredy? Okay. Sorry. I'm just thinking of Patrik. -Have you...? I wonder one thing. -Yes? Have you been with him on your island? Are you mad? Patrik is my half-brother. But...I think it's best if you leave now. I will call dad. But we will meet tomorrow. Bye. Where have you been? Patrik, where have you been? -When mom told that they were getting married... -Getting married? When? On new years eve. I said that I didn't want to participate on the wedding. Then she was sorry and then angry and told me that I'm always nasty. Then I said that I didn't want to live with her and Johan. Do you know what she did then? Then she said: 'Don't you get it, child, that you will never see your real father.' Then I left. I have lots of huts out in the woods. I saw you when you searched today. How long will you be gone? A week, until they miss me properly. But it's so damn cold. I have done something wrong. I called mom a moment ago and said- -that your mom had locked herself in a refuse container. Why did you do that? I wanted mom to become worried but no afterwards, I... Can you say tell mom that I regret this a lot and apologize? (CAR BREAKS) -No! -Damn... No, but, Patrik! Stop! It's too late. They will be pissed! Stop! ANNA: Where is the container, you bitch? I'm no longer afraid of you! -Just tell me where the container is! -What are you talking about? (EVERYONE SHOUTS) Enough now, damn it. Can you stop thinking about yourselves a couple of seconds? Shut up! -Alice has something to tell us. Patrik was in my room just now, but he went out in the woods again. -He is very afraid of you, all of you. -Oh my god, Alice... I won't do it! I will not go back to school until Patrick is back. Lotta, of course she is worried. If he is allowed to run like that... Bullshit! It's my family too! -Your family is here, Alice. -And dad and Anna will get married. -Will they get married? -Yes! Patrik is my halv-brother. Come in now! Now listen. What are you doing? This is enough, damn it! Stop! Come back! Come back! -Leave him alone! -Come! Let's talk. Damn kid! -You are so mean! -How much more will he destroy things for us? In the nights, in school, at work! Damn, I'll be too late! You can't chase a child back home! But what shall I do then? What do you think I should do, damn it? (PLOP) Mom! He has fallen in! What shall we do? -But he can swim, can't he? He is twelve! -But it's ice cold in the water! Do you want him to die or what? Run back home, call dad and Anna. Show them the way. -What will you do? -Go and get them! Hurry! ANNA: Oh my God, there she is. -Alice! Quickly, quickly! Alice, do you remember exactly where it was? JOHAN: Is this the right way? ANNA: Is it where the boats are? ALlCE: At the beach. ANNA: Where are they? -There! -Where? ANNA: Patrik! -Oh, my God! -Mom swims well. -Patrik! -Mom! Mom! Patrik... Oh, Patrik! My little darling... Forgive me. Thank you. I know that his dad doesn't want to hear of him. So it may be rather good for him, even though he doesn't feel that way. That my dad can join in as extra dad to him. Because he has never had any dad. -You agree well with Patrik. -Agree... well... but... We do have similar opions about things. We both want things as they were before. But we are not best friends. We are half-brother and half-sister. So we have some family traits! Dad! (FAINT SOUND IN THE NEXT ROOM) Hello and good morning. Have you slept well? -When did you arrive? -Just now, with the morning ferry. Newbaked buns! What the hell are you doing here? I live here. What do you think about my pictures? I will have them on an exhibition now. It's dad who lives here. Yes, and me and Patrik. And you and Pontus, as often as you like. We live with my mom. -Where is dad? -He is... -Here I am, up with the rooster. -I want to talk to you, alone... Haven't you told that I will come here? No, I... I was just going to. -Where is Patrik? -In the cabin in the woods. Take it easy now. Sorry, Alice. -You... -You damn liar! I didn't know what to do, because I was afraid that- -mom would be angry if I told her that Anna will be here. I was afraid that she wouldn't allow you to come here. And that's why I didn't say anything, but I was just going to tell when Anna came. -But I understand... -Not a fucking thing! You only care about yourself. You give a damn about me! I don't know what to do. I just want everyone to be happy. I don't want to be here. I want to go home to mom. But you just came here. Can't we be here a couple of days now, then, and... -Only a couple of days and then... -Don't touch me! -But my dear... -Don't touch me! Then I think we will take this walk after all. Honey... Everything will be alright. It will be fine. We just have to give her time. One gets completely shocked. To see such a bitch like me! I go out. I do it. Look now! Well, now it must happen... I go out with the boots and the stuff to her. Then you can dress Pontus and we will leave. Damn, it shouldn't be like this. LOTTA: Hi, neither Johan, Lotta, Alice or Pontus can pick up the phone right now. Say anything you like and then we will call back as soon as possible. Bye. Why aren't you answering, mom? Where are you? I don't want to be here. Hurry, come here! Dad promised us to be alone, but the bitch is here. She is calling us bad words and dad just stands and watches. Call me! Alice, you will catch cold. Mom will not be glad if you come home sick. Come! OK, let's do this then. Yes! Wait... Yes! Goal! I put the boots here with a banana. Alice... We are going on an expedition. It would be fun if you join us. Patrik, come! -I will cut you when you are asleep. -No, it has to be this way. Show Pontus your hut in the woods. -Do you want to see it? Add to it a bit? You go ahead. ANNA: Careful! You see the ladder over there is a bit broken. Dad, let Patrik spin also. -Now I will chase Patrik. -No, I don't want to. -Don't you want? -No, let go! No, not me! Stop it! Stop it, Johan! Do you have to do this all the time. It's embarrassing! Why are you doing this? That was damn unnecessary. Sorry. But why are you doing this? -So many leaves... -What kind of man is this? Do you have to show everything? The children can't handle this. -I'm showing that I love you. -It's too early. -But it isn't forbidden? -Patrik, wait for me! True love in the woods... Let's go! - Patrik! Where did you come from? -From the sky I suppose. -Yes, it seems so. -Are we friends then? -Yes... -Sorry I yelled a bit. -Let's go on expedition. -Shall we go on expedition? -Ourselves. Aren't we going with them? Ourselves. We can go down to the beach ourselves. You and me? Can he also join? Yes. But...yes... Two! There is no speed... -We must do like this. -Well done, dad! -What? That is three. Did you see? -Yes. You can also do this. Higher, dad, higher! Higher! Higher! -I won! -That was the limit. -What's the matter? -Pee. -Don't forget to pull down the trousers. -Yes... How do you think he is handling everything with your mom and me and... He doesn't understand... Well, as you and me do. Alice... Have you called mom and told her that you... want to leave? -May I? -Of course you may. I want you to be here. Pontus and you. But you have to do as you like. Call mom. (THE TELEPHONE RINGS) -Yes, this is Alice. -You have one new message. LOTTA: How can you seduce the children to that slut? You promised to be alone. This is child abuse. The slut shall not infect my children. Alice calls and cries and screams. The children must come home now, otherwise I will report you! They must come home now! Otherwise you'll see what I can do! The message was received at 13:59. -Wow, that went fast. -Yes. And what decisions have we made? I stay. Thank you. -Will there be any food here? -No, there will be no food. -Yes, we will eat in 15 minutes. -You can taste my pancakes. Mother's are very delicious. -Don't pay attention to her. -I will make so delicious pancakes. -What have you done with the crispbread? -Puzzle! Hi. We will have pancakes you see. So, let's see... Damn! This is not a good frying pan, you see. I will just do this... I use to turn them in the air but now it doesn't work. This is how to show things. Then it usually doesn't work as well. Damn pancake! It gets stuck in the frying pan! It's that damn teflon surface! It becomes like this sometimes. Now you'll see... Those damn fucking pancakes! -Lie in your dad's bed. -That's my mom's. -No, it's actually my dad's. -Nothing here is his. Everything is mom's. -It's my dad's house. -Just as much my mom's! Hello there! What are you doing? One at a time! -What's the matter, Patrik? -I lied here first but must go. -Is this true, Alice? Yes, I actually want to rest a while and this is my dad's bed. -Come. -What is it? -I want to be alone. -Go out on the veranda then. If Patrik lies here then Alice must respect that. They must both respect that this is our bedroom. Period. -If you can't agree, then go out. -Shall Alice be allowed to throw Patrik out? -Be sensible regarding the sitation. -We are five who feel different. -I give a damn about this bed. -Me too! -Well, I'll be damned... -Yes, damn it! Can you be so kind and stop that! What? Creak, creak, creak... No. Time to eat! Come! -He thinks he desides over me. -She thinks she decides over me. -Only my dad decides over me. -But you don't have any. Are you stupid or what...? He is a woodcutter in Canada. He cuts so big trees that you can't find here. Look! Oh... They think they can decide over us, as we were little children. But we are actually 12 years old. Do you want them to be together? No. -What do you want then? -Everything to be as before. What do you want? I also want everything to be as before. Are you deaf? Come now, I said! -Incredibly delicious pancakes! -Thank you. -Aren't they, Alice? -Mmm... -What? I didn't hear. -Enormously delicious! Enormous! What the hell are you doing? She becomes sorry. She has been cooking this for you. Aren't the pancakes to your taste? What's wrong? What? Are you behaving like this at home? -Alice, are you doing this to your mother? -No, but she isn't my mother. Now, damn it... Don't you believe... -Don't believe, damn it... -What are you saying? I don't get it. Not me either. (MUSIC AND SINGING) (THE MUSIC CEASES) You just can't go away like this. Then you give up, then the children win. Do you mean that we must conquer them? Our own children? As a damn boxing match? I'm just saying that we must give them more time. You said it yourself. -Time and patience. -If someone has patience, then it's me. But how much shit do I have to take from your daughter? -Only Alice who is the problem? -No, Patrik also. But Alice is so loaded with bullshit from your damn ex wife. I get no chance. Can't you see how she studies every move you do? -You are a little sensitive now, aren't you? -You are blind, Johan. She hates me. -Then I'll say the same about Patrik. -Not a single bad word about my son! -You spit out shit about my daughter. -Damn you! -Damn yourself and your discontent. -Go home to your wife. You are still married. Then you can relax! Without any problems at all! Go home to her! Run out to the woods then, damn it! As all the others! Out! (THE FRONT DOOR OPENS AND SLAMS) -Are you sitting here by yourself? -I cannot go on any longer. -Go on what? -Pancake. But you don't have to eat any more pancakes. -I'm tired, I want to rest. -Go ahead then. Damn! Shit! Sleep well! He is watching you. -Good night. -Good night. Sleep well. Shall we do something funny tomorrow? Perhaps we should talk, you and me. Sleep well now. -Can't you sleep here with me? -No, I'll sleep in there. -Please... -No. You will sleep like a log. I know that. Alice, sorry I flared up before today. I'm just like that. If I become angry, then I become angry. But lots of goodies also. If I become glad, then I become glad also. I just want to say that I think you are such a nice girl. I will tell you a secret. Something not even Johan knows about yet. Before I got Patrik, I expected another child, a girl. The first time I felt her kicking inside my stomach- -then I knew immediately that this was a little Alice. I don't know why, i just knew. 'Her name will be Alice.' But when I was going to give birth then there was something wrong, so... she died. I still don't know what was the cause. Then I meet a wonderful man and she has a girl called Alice! Isn't it strange? That woodcutter... Was he her father also? Oh, Patrik... Does he lie? Never. It's just that... What is the truth for Patrik perhaps not always is the truth for others. His father and I had a rock band called Wood Machine. We had strange names back then. But his father didn't want to admit that Patrik is his son. He doesn't even want to talk to him. Patrik dreams about him all the time. Good night then, Alice. Sleep well. See you tomorrow. ANNA: Ouch! My God, how will this end? (GROANINGS) Pontus... There is a ghost in there. -I'm afraid, I want to sleep with daddy. -Come, I'll go with you. -Is the ghost here? -Maybe. We must be quiet. ANNA: God! -What are they doing? -They are dreaming. Go in and tell. Daddy, there is giant ghost in there with giant claws and giant teeth! -What? -A ghost... -A ghost? -Yes. -Why do you think it's a ghost? -Alice told me. I want to sleep here. -Here? -Yes. -Alice says... -Hmm... JOHAN: Well, we must go in and look for the little ghost then. (KNOCKING) (THUNDER) Daddy, daddy, daddy! There is someone out there. I get it! Scaring your little brother... There is someone out there. It's true. It's scarey. (KNOCKING) (KNOCKING) JOHAN: Yes, yes... -Hello, Johan. -Hello. -What are you doing here? -We came to collect the children. -In an easy manner, for the sake of the children.. -Collect? What are you saying? -Don't take it personal. -Are you making fun of me? -Grandma! -My dear. Now everything is okay. Don't be afraid anymore. -You must explain... -Put on your clothes, Alice. And help Pontus. We wait here. Now, tell your wife that she must tell me what the hell is going on. -Sonya, we can't just... -Henry, tell them now. -Johan... -Yes? Don't take it personal, but when your own daughter asks for help... Lotta was in despair when she heard Alice's cries for help. 'Cries for help?' Here is Lottas's phone. You can hear what Alice is saying. Johan, perhaps you should ask grandpa and grandma to walk in. -No. -Yes.-Welcome to our cottage. Hello, my name is Anna Solberg and I am Johan's wife. So far, isn't Lotta Johan's wife? Anna Solberg, Johans wife, that is. Welcome to the cottage. I'm Henry. -That was kind... -My husband is very polite. I like that in a man. In women as well. Patrik, my son. You were lucky who managed to avoid the rain. Yes, perhaps we can offer you a warming brandy?? -A small one. -Are you sure? -Nej, rather a big. -Yes, I have. Johan, now you hear yourself how Alice is with you. Sorry, dad, sorry. I didn't mean all that. I was just so sad and angru. You don't have to aplogize. You feel what you feel. -Where isr Lotta? -Does it matter? I want to talk to Lotta. Do you really have to answer in that way?! Absurd! You come in the middle of the night and pull up the kids who are sleeping. By consideration, if you recognize that word. Sonya lversen, and you talk about consideration? You don't know what consideration is, damn it. -Johan... -Damn! -Where is she? -Down at the bridge. Here...? Yes, we came by taxi boat. They are waiting to tack us back. Okay then... Perhaps it's better that we let Henry collect Lotta. Dad, I want to talk to you. Alone! Come! Well, perhaps we should also have a glass of brandy. -Only a little, thank you. -Woops. Sorry, a little too much perhaps. Cheers, then. For Alice! I don't want you to be sad. You are my dad. You must not cry. I'm not crying. Don't worry. Everything is my fault. No. Alice, nothing that happened is your fault. Yes, because I said what I said in the phone and now mom has come here for me. But... dad, look what I'm wearing. They are waiting for you now. What to say? Yes... No, let's go. You may go home this time. Yes, nothing more to it. but I want you to go too. -Shall really me and Patrik...? -I'm not going to stand on the quay for myself. They are coming now. Goodbye. Don't you want me to go there? No, you know...mom... Well, you get it. We'll not meet this weekend but the weeken after that, honey. -I call you tomorrow. -Yes. -Bye bye, Anna and Patrik. -Bye bye. Oh, my dear child! How I have longed for you. -How I have longed! -I have longed for you too! -Anything particular you are angry with? -That they are not listening. I love both mom and dad and want to be with both of them. But they always argue over the phone about where I should be and not be. What are you trying to say which they don't listen to? I don't want to feel myself as a letter which is thrown between two places. I want to feel secure wherever I am. LOTTA:Look! Do you remember we were fishing there last year? How nice! Hello! Welcome! Welcome! Oh, my God, so great to see you! -Have you been driving in a cab? Are you crazy? -The folding top broke down by the wind. Aren't you freezing? LOTTA: It's bigger. TlNA: Yes, I have added to it. LOTTA: And the stable, it smells so good. I can smell the horses. TlNA: No, Alice, here! LOTTA: Have you enlarged? TlNA: No... TlNA: There you see. I told you it was a long time ago you were here. Come in! Livingroom, bedroom and a small kitchen. Not fancy but clean and warm. LOTTA: Very nice! We will like it here. - Won't we, Alice? -I long for dad. -What? Isn't it beautiful? Come! Yes, very nice! All these horses came by sea from Iceland when they were 5-6 years old. -When can they return back home then? -This is their home. But to their parents. No, those who have travelled from Iceland can not go back. -Sometimes maybe. -No, those are the regulations. This is a mom. Her name is Fina. And her name is Stierna. -But the dads then? -No, they cannot see their dads again. No, Alice! No... damn. I didn't think about that. -Alice! The news. How can I help you? -Hi, I'm Alice Lindberg. -Hi there, Alice. Hi, I want to talk to dad. He is reporting in USA. -But I can't reach him. -He came back today. One moment.. Foreign editorial department, Johan Lindberg. Hello? Who is this? -Dad... -Is it Alice? My dear little girl, I have called and called both to the house and- -left lots of messages on mom's mobile phone. Where have you been? -Where are you? -In Norway. ln Norway?! What the hell are you doing in Norway? -Perhaps we will live here. -Tina wants to show you something. Come. Live in Norway? What are you saing? Mom and Tina will perhaps open a business together. And we will check if the school is good here. The children are hungry and tired. Alice can call you tonight. If you want something you can write a letter. -Why haven't you told me? -Dad has been away. -He has called lots of times. -I haven't talked to him. Let me see your mobile phone! -Why? -The incoming messages. Okay, he has called. He has called lots of times. But I can't take all the calls. I don't have the strength to talk to him. He has left us, Alice. He has a new family. We must build something new without him. How are we supposed to do it if he is interrupting us all the time? -Don't you want me to meet dad? -Of course, and Pontus too. But... he has hurt us so much, that we need to be alone for a while. When he calls like that he is only thinking of his own good, thinking of himself. If he was thinking about you, then he would leave you alone. He has bad conscience just because he left us. If he would think about your own good then he wouldn't force you- -to meet that woman and her son. Lotta... Perhaps the children should rest a little. You and me can cook something. -I'll just finish... -I want us to talk now. Let's go then. -Alice, help Pontus finding Dino. He is lying in there, Alice will help you. Tina and I will cook something first. We'll fetch you when the food is ready. - Will you help Pontus? Good. Bye then. I forgot my sweater in the car. I'll come back soon. LOTTA: You don't know how I have been. TlNA: I'm just saying 'take it easy'. LOTTA: 'Take it easy?' TlNA: Don't use the children as weapons. -I'm not. -Yes, you are, dear Lotta. I know that he has hurt you, but your behaviour is not hurting Johan- -but Alice... I hve to tell you how it is. She is old enough for the truth. Yes, she is old enough but still a child. Which truth by the way? -She is your daughter, not your friend. -Not you either in that case. Lotta, this is what I'm trying to be. It's not that damn easy for me! You called and told me that you and Johan had agreed. -Have you talked to Johan? -No. But if I had? You are my friends, both of you. Besides, I can't stand watching how you force me to choose side. -You already have. -Perhaps. But not your side and not Johan's, but the children's. I can't stand watching how you tare apart the relation that Alice have to her father. You really take care of him. Have you been together or something? Damn it all! Haven't you always looked at him? Perhaps you were fucking already back then. Did you? Is this the way you talk to everyone who has a different opinion regarding the children? Don't you talk to me about children. You stick to your damn horses! Listen to me! I'm sick and tired driving. I want to know where we are heading. If you don't answer I will scream! Shut up now! Understand? Do as I say! -Period, nothing more to it. -But that's no answer. Yes, a very good answer! If I say we are going, then we are. -But you don't know where to go. -Yes, I do. Okay, then. I don't know. But how am I supposed to know everything all the time? (SCREAMING) If it's okay that children may have an opinion, then Pontus wants to say something. I don't want to live in Norway. I want to go home. Oh, come... -I'm sorry for all the mess. -No problem! We continue... -Aren't we, Alice? -Mmm... Bye. -Hi! -Hi! Welcome. -Hi there! -Hi. -Hi, Alice! -Hi. -How did it feel coming back? -It went well. And... Patrik and I have come closer. And Anton...? And Anton and I have looked at eachother, but I don't know if he likes me. -Of course he does. -I hope so. PUPILS: Come on!, reds! Come on! OTHER PUPILS: Yellow, yellow, yellow! (WHISTLE) -My god, so handsome! -What did he say? -Did he kiss you? -Stop... Alice! -I know this is mom's week. -When did you see Patrik recently? Yesterday. What's the matter? Anna and Patrik quarrelled. He has been out here all night. Do you know where he can be? When they lived in the green housde he was often in cabins in the wood. Which wood? (EVERYBODY SCREAM 'PATRlK') Oh, my God, forgive me, Patrik, forgive me! What did I say? Patrik, forgive me. ...26, 27, 28, 29, 30. I know what you are thinking now, but perhaps nothing has happened. He can be somewhere else. But now let the professionals take over. Go diretly back home, all of you, so that not your parents will be worried too. -Dad... -Mom is over there.- Yes? -I will absolutely not... -Yes, absolutely! Let's go home. No more kids in the wood! I'll call as soon as we know more. -I can accompany Alilce back home. -Yes, that will be fine. Thank you. It's okay. Just one thing... I saw Anna said something to herself. 'Forgive me, Patrik, forgive me.' -What happened yesterday evening? -That's something between Patrik and her. Go home now. Hello. Go home... Can you wait a moment? Anna... Yes? -I think that Patrik will come back. -Do you? I hope so. I shouted that his father never would like to see him. Now hurry up to mom, and we will search. Hurry home. Thank you. Hello. -Tina! -Oh, dear... Hello, my big little favourite! -Is mom at home? -Yes. Do you think I may cmoe in? Yes, I may.- Hello, by the way. -Hello. Anton. -Tina. -Shall we try again then? -Yes. No... Lotta sat on the beach with Costas, and then Costas said to Lotta... He said Do you want some grass, he said to Lotta. -What did he say? -Do you want some grass? No, thank you, Lotta said. ln Sweden we do not eat grass I didn't say that. You have altered that. They sat on the lawn. On the lawn, yes... Thank you for the food. But will you... now, alredy? Okay. Sorry. I'm just thinking of Patrik. -Have you...? I wonder one thing. -Yes? Have you been with him on your island? Are you mad? Patrik is my half-brother. But...I think it's best if you leave now. I will call dad. But we will meet tomorrow. Bye. Where have you been? Patrik, where have you been? -When mom told that they were getting married... -Getting married? When? On new years eve. I said that I didn't want to participate on the wedding. Then she was sorry and then angry and told me that I'm always nasty. Then I said that I didn't want to live with her and Johan. Do you know what she did then? Then she said: 'Don't you get it, child, that you will never see your real father.' Then I left. I have lots of huts out in the woods. I saw you when you searched today. How long will you be gone? A week, until they miss me properly. But it's so damn cold. I have done something wrong. I called mom a moment ago and said- -that your mom had locked herself in a refuse container. Why did you do that? I wanted mom to become worried but no afterwards, I... Can you say tell mom that I regret this a lot and apologize? (CAR BREAKS) -No! -Damn... No, but, Patrik! Stop! It's too late. They will be pissed! Stop! ANNA: Where is the container, you bitch? I'm no longer afraid of you! -Just tell me where the container is! -What are you talking about? (EVERYONE SHOUTS) Enough now, damn it. Can you stop thinking about yourselves a couple of seconds? Shut up! -Alice has something to tell us. Patrik was in my room just now, but he went out in the woods again. -He is very afraid of you, all of you. -Oh my god, Alice... I won't do it! I will not go back to school until Patrick is back. Lotta, of course she is worried. If he is allowed to run like that... Bullshit! It's my family too! -Your family is here, Alice. -And dad and Anna will get married. -Will they get married? -Yes! Patrik is my halv-brother. Come in now! Now listen. What are you doing? This is enough, damn it! Stop! Come back! Come back! -Leave him alone! -Come! Let's talk. Damn kid! -You are so mean! -How much more will he destroy things for us? In the nights, in school, at work! Damn, I'll be too late! You can't chase a child back home! But what shall I do then? What do you think I should do, damn it? (PLOP) Mom! He has fallen in! What shall we do? -But he can swim, can't he? He is twelve! -But it's ice cold in the water! Do you want him to die or what? Run back home, call dad and Anna. Show them the way. -What will you do? -Go and get them! Hurry! ANNA: Oh my God, there she is. -Alice! Quickly, quickly! Alice, do you remember exactly where it was? JOHAN: Is this the right way? ANNA: Is it where the boats are? ALlCE: At the beach. ANNA: Where are they? -There! -Where? ANNA: Patrik! -Oh, my God! -Mom swims well. -Patrik! -Mom! Mom! Patrik... Oh, Patrik! My little darling... Forgive me. Thank you. I know that his dad doesn't want to hear of him. So it may be rather good for him, even though he doesn't feel that way. That my dad can join in as extra dad to him. Because he has never had any dad. -You agree well with Patrik. -Agree... well... but... We do have similar opions about things. We both want things as they were before. But we are not best friends. We are half-brother and half-sister. So we have some family traits!
