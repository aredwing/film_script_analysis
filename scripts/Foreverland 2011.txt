But first, allow me to show you Some of our newer models. Here we have a 20 gauge steel shell. Locking and fully casketed. It also comes in a dark hunter green finish with Gold tone maple leaf design hardware. Moving on. My heart's set on Angelica. Ahh. The Rolls Royce of basketry. We're planning a sale In late October featuring some stunning new Bavarian design. Keep me posted, Mr. Steadman. You mind if I close the hatch? Just for a moment. You know William, while I enjoy these visits Of yours, it occurs to me that a young man Such as yourself, should be out shopping for... cars. Not... coffins. They say a coffin holds enough air To keep a man alive for three hours. So when I'm in here... Why does it feel like I can live forever? I've been asked today to talk about Cystic Fibrosis. Now, normally I would perform One to three hours of physio daily. Like Tarzan. Only I'm not showing off for Jane... I'm just trying to breathe. Because my body lacks the proper digestive enzymes To keep my pancreas clear of cysts, And my liver unblocked from bile, I have to pop more pills than Rush Limbaugh. And uh... Other than that, life's peachy. Questions? I really enjoyed your talk. - Thanks. - Penny. Pre-med. Uh, Will. Pre-dead. I was wondering... If it's true that your chances of fertilizing an ovum Are roughly 2.06 million, I mean... Technically wouldn't that make you infertile? Um, like a neutered goat. Well, this... has its advantages. Are we... flirting? You tell me. Sorry. I don't have a lot of room in my life for anything other Than my routine. I've got to do my physio. Take my meds... Puff an hour in the nebulizer. To keep my weight up, I've got to eat 4,000 calories a day. Oh yeah. I go to a lot of funerals, too. At 21 I've probably been to more funerals Than most 80 year olds. Bobby and I were friends back in the ward. We'd always joke that only one of us would make it Past our 21st birthday. I guess he was right. Cough sounds soupy today. Last week it was barky, and the week before It was hydraulic. We ran into Sarah Bennet today. Pancake house. Mom, it was the 6th grade! I held her hand at recess. And then... she cheated on me with Ronald Brinkman. Well she asked about ya. And she has really filled out, son. Jesus, guys! I know you don't like it when we make a big fuss So we settled for just one. Happy 21, Will. Elevated sodium chloride levels Are often an early indicator. That's why you tasted salt on the skin. Of course, with all the recent treatment programs There are many patients living into their late 20's. But when death speaks to us, What does it say? Death does not speak about itself. It does not say "fear me. " It does not say "wonder at me. " It does not say "understand me. " But it says to us, "Think of life. " "Think of the privilege of life. " I've heard so many priests deliver eulogies, I can't help but rate them on their performance. It's like some tragic American Idol in my head. Bobby hated flowers. So what do they do? Toss a hundred roses at his funeral. 65 actually. I guess you knew that. You probably don't recognize me without an IV drip. I remember you, Will. Maybe you can answer a question. Why Del Sol? It's a healing shrine down in Mexico. Some of the kids, we... used to joke about going. He just kept saying it the night he died. "I'm going to Del Sol, Hannah. " "I'm going to Del Sol. " Wanna get out of here? Here's to Angelica. She your girlfriend? Who wants to get involved with someone With an expiry date. Everybody's got an expiry date. The average human body contains enough salt To fill four salt shakers. In ancient Rome, Conscription soldiers were often paid in salt. Hence the expression, "A man worth his salt. " It's also very good on cucumber. There's something you need to see. Estate of Bobby Crane. I should go. Repeat customers are such a rarity In this line of business. You work pretty hard, Mr. Steadman. Maybe you should take a load off. I don't think that would be entirely appropriate. How can you sell these things with any sense of integrity If you don't take them for a test ride? It's a casket, William. Not a Ferrari. Try the Newberry. She's got lumbar support that'll make a Volvo blush. All this craftsmanship... For a few measly minutes in the sun, and then... An eternity in darkness. Doesn't quite seem fair, does it? No William. No it doesn't. And they danced By the light of the moon. The moon, the moon. They danced by the light of the moon. He tastes like salt. Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Rankin. Ron Hodges. Uh, I'm not really sure what this... What I'm doing here, or what this has to do with Bobby. I was retained by Mr. Crane two months prior to his, uh, Unfortunate passing, and... His instructions were specific. You are to be the sole custodian. Custodian of what? Ah. This. This is...? There've been some exciting movements In modern urn design. - This is Bobby? - Well... Pyrotechnically. What the hell was in his grave? Um, a large expensive box. Filled with... My client's pornographic DVD collection, And 14 cases of Apple-berry Mountain flavored Snapple. I'm also... Play you a DVD. Well. I'm only telling you this, because... I like you. And because I'm dead. Um... Back in the ward, Back in the day... You were the funniest kid I ever knew. And then of course, bam, puberty hits and You turn into Ghouly VonMorbid. Um... But here's the plan. You my friend... Are gonna drive 2,000 miles South. To a Mexican church called "El Santuario Del Sol. " And there you're gonna meet a priest... Named Salvador. The two of you are going to scatter my ashes... Over a sacred salt pond that runs under the church. If you don't do this for me Will I swear, to God, I'll haunt you. Everyday. I will haunt you like poltergeist buddy. Alright, I will Jacob Marley your ass, for the rest Of your short, bleak life. Do this for me, Will. You're some kind of prankster, Bobby. I'll give you that. Can't find a better drinking buddy? Relax. I'm only here for the flowers. How long was Bobby planning this? He didn't tell me. Not that I blame him. If our parents knew about this they'd be... Filing injunctions. It's heavy. Hey, wait, wait. Where are you going with that? Bobby had a last request. I'm making sure it's being honored. I never said I wouldn't honor his last request. This means you're taking it? I don't even have a car. I've never left the city... Just... Please just give me some time to figure this out. Yeah, hi. I need to mail a package to Baja, Mexico. It's like a, a metal... Mm-hmmm. Yeah. And I have some instructions that need to be Sent with it also. No, I know. I understand that you have rules About that sort of contraband. Perfectly clear. Alrighty, thanks Trish. You've been... helpful. [Grunts, punches wall[ Give me a deep breath in. I hear crackles. No snaps or pops? Well I see no other option. We're gonna have to run a full course of antibiotics. How long this time? 14 days, then we'll reassess. I knew it sounded soupy. Rise and shine sleepyhead. You've got a big day. Okay, deep breath in. More, and push it out. Keep going. Push, push... Push, push! Push, push, push. Okay, deep breath in... Relax. Same medication as last time? ADEK's twice a day. Creon-20's three to four, with every meal. Two with snacks. Zythromycin, two every second day. And whatever that guy in the alley was selling. If you find another vein, I'll be impressed. Don't worry. Worse to worst honey, we'll poke a bitty hole In that cute little work you got throbbing in your temple. Hm. Whoo. You weren't lying. Last time they found one here. I understand we're having trouble finding A vein again! Like mining for gold in a litter box. See what we got here. Deep breath in. Again. Well perhaps it's time we re-evaluate The idea of a permanent port-a-cath. I told you before, I'm not down for that cyborg shit. And as I said before, Prevention is the best medicine. Just tell me how long. This is not a positive line of questioning. A ballpark. Three years? Is it... five years? I mean... Tell me if I'm hotter or colder. Just show me on a pie chart! Will, you're healthy. And you'll remain healthy if you continue your therapy. Hey. We both know what this is about. It's not about Bobby. It's about me finding some mystical cure that he Wouldn't go find for himself. Maybe Bobby believed in miracles. Maybe... He said his prayers every night. I don't. I'll do this. I'll do everything he asks. But there's one thing I refuse to do. I will not hope. When do we leave? - Mexico? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We um, follow the coast Down to Baja. Figure a four day drive. Mexico. Yeah! Mexico, that place, you know. That place Right below San Diego. I know where Mexico is. I... Do you know what could happen if you get sick Out there in the elements? I would soon just cut your head off, look at you. We're not going to Borneo, Mom. This is... This is tourist country. Okay. Have you talked to Doctor Abisi? Okay. If worst comes to absolute worst... You can always reach out to your Aunt in L.A. Ok. I'm gonna be fine. Carl is there anything you'd like to add? Yeah. Dad, you okay? I wanted to surprise you, for your birthday. But I couldn't get the darn solenoid to fire. No. Yeah. You finished it huh? So uh... Buckle up man. Thanks, guys. Do it! So... Primrose oil for the lungs and diaphragm. And Saint John's Wart should help with the anxiety. Who said I was anxious? Well you should be. Clock's ticking. Alright. So you've really never left the city? Nope. That's what happens when you spend half your life In a hospital. So... Straight down to Mexico? No stops. No sleep? I won't so much as blink. Over 2,000 miles. I'm not here to sight-see. This is a business trip. And what if at some point, I find myself needing to pee. Huh. You think your mom is going to hate me For taking you on this trip? That depends if I get back in one piece or not. You make yourself sound like cheap luggage. You don't know the half of it. When I was a kid, My mother spent so much time coddling me I felt like a designer handbag. Well count your blessings. I broke my arm playing hopscotch once. Took them two weeks to notice I'd been using my wrong hand to eat breakfast. Put this up! Come on. I gotta put this up. Ahh! Stop, stop, stop! Will, there's goats! - Goat? What? - Up on the roof! - Where? - Back up! Back up, back up! There's goats on the roof. I want to go see them. Okay, but not for long. No, no photos. Thank you! Thank you! Woo hoo! You're like a little baby. Woah, woah, woah! Oh God! Do you hear that? That thumping? That's just the radio. No, that's not the radio. Pull over! Stop right here. Stop. Agh! - We have to call your parents. - I can't. My dad will be crushed. He built this thing Out of puppy love and horsepower. Maybe it's some minor fix. It's a sign. I thought you said miracles were just A sucker's bet with God. No, it's... It's an actual sign. Where you taking her? Mexico. Not today you're not. What's the diagnosis? So what I'm proposing is I... Take advance payment for the new... Radiator, mechanical fan you'll be needing. And... Place the parts order forthwith. Say six bills. Six hundred dollars? Well this my friend, is an antique. Requiring unique and unusual innards. How long's it gonna take? Well I suggest in the meantime you bed down For the night. How's that figure? Great. Where'd he say this campsite was? Bobby knew I hated the outdoors. Bobby didn't plan this part, I'm pretty sure. No he planned this. This even a campground? Why would anyone want to sleep here? I can help if you want. With your physio. No, I'm on vacation. I'm fine, really. I've got lungs like a Sherpa. Alright. Suit yourself. It's not like I was offering some rub and tug. No happy endings for me. Bobby was the same, you know. Wouldn't get close to anyone. Couldn't see the point. It's tough to be a long-term thinker When you've got a short-term outlook. You think you're so different. It doesn't matter if you live to be 30, or... Everybody thinks life's too short. It's late. We should be going. Anything? How long do we wait? I don't think he's coming back. I'm beginning to wonder if it's even a functioning garage. He's coming back. He's not coming back. I'm starving. Mm, wine gums. Will! Stop him! - Don't move! No! - Wait! Hey! Stop it! Hey! Stop it! No! Just breathe, Will. Just breathe. Son of a... You've reached the Bellevue County Police Station. Office hours are 9am - 6pm daily. Leave a message at the tone. I'm not calling my parents. So what'd they say? Filed a report. They said check back in 17 days. That's it?! We're on our own. So, we walk. You gave away your life savings for a mechanical fan And radiator. Still got about... Two hundred. You should hang onto it. Why me? Because you're the responsible one. We're in the middle of Washington State, How far is this supposed to get us? What about you? How much did you bring? I'm between semesters. I've got about... A hundred bucks plus one maxed out credit card. Your mother entrusted me with your care. What am I, fine China? Let's hitchhike. Why isn't this working? Needs more thumb. Ha! - Hello! Thank you. - Hi! Thank you. This is silly! We can't hitchhike all the way to Mexico. Then we walk, then. I could be like the next Rick Hansen, er... er... Terry Fox! You know, the great CF hike to Mexico. Yeah, I'm sure you'd be a great poster boy, but... Cystic Fibrosis is just not all that glamorous. Compared to what? AIDS? Cancer? Parkinson's? Genital Herpes gets better press. It's viral marketing. Get a publicist. Then again, maybe it's a good thing Being the underdog disease. I'm like Mountain Dew! I can't believe you like caner better than CF. - I didn't say I liked it. - You said it's way cooler. It's all in the branding, you know? It's the Coca-Cola of killer diseases. Even has it's own zodiac. Think that's a coincidence? Now lupus! There's an illness. Nah. Sounds like a werewolf with acne. There. How you doing? My lungs feel like they're packed with silly puddy. Maybe I should go to the hospital. No. Here. Take this. It's ginger root. To expand your capillaries. Mm. You're not by any chance trying to kill me, are you? No, sweetie. If I was trying to kill you, I would bring you To a hospital. Just ask Bobby. Maybe I'll go quietly too. Just like him. Drown in my sleep, peacefully. It wasn't peaceful. The way you hear people talk. It wasn't like that with Bobby. It was miserable. It wasn't peaceful. Hannah, I'm... When I was a kid, The way my dad explained it to me... He told me I was like Jacques Cousteau. He said "The world is your ocean. " It can be dangerous out there, And sometimes, hard to breathe. "Don't forget your snorkel if you want to go explore. " You smell that? Salt. - Thanks! - See ya later. No more hitchhiking. I'm done. I need a baby wipe. He wasn't so bad. He was friendly. Yeah, well you weren't the one Wresting his hand off your thighs since Malibu. So we catch the next bus to Mexico. We're broke, remember? Barely got enough for coffee. There's always Aunt Vicky. Yeah, well I thought your Mom said She's only in case of emergency. She's family. When's the last time you visited? Never. Uh... She and my mom Had a falling out when I was just a kid. Okay, so we're just popping in to say "Hi, can we borrow some bus fare?!" Yeah, sure. Why not? Well... Maybe she's some hermit who collects her poo In Mayonnaise jars. What if she's a cat lady? Did you know that cats give out pheromones That may you... I don't know what you're selling, but You'll be buying neck braces by the bushel if you don't Go on and scat now! Aunt Vicky?! - Go on, scat I said! - Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, I'm... I'm your nephew! I'm Fran's son, Will. Oh. Would you like some Chai tea? Please pay homage to the poor and worldly. So, you two sweethearts Need a place to stay for the night? Naturally. Yeah, that would... That'd be great. Sure. Skirting those pesky pre-marital taboos, are we? - No, no, no. - No! We're... We promise not to break any taboos. Would you happen to have a fork, Vicky? I don't partake in tines. Um... So Vicky, my mom mentioned something about... You had a falling out? There was no falling to be done. One of us raised ourselves a little higher is what transpired. Hmmm. What happened? Truths were told. Lies exposed. And ego eggs cracked into... into an omelet Of enlightenment. Well that... - That doesn't sound so bad. - And I warned her... That Carl would lead her from the path. Your mom married a non-believer, And she was punished for it. How was my mom punished? - Let's just go, Will. - No, wait. How was she punished? With you. With me? Look Vicky, your head's full of crayons and raccoons. This coming from a slut bodied little... little tart! You have flaps in your jacks, Missy! Uh, thank you very much. We'll see you at the next reunion. Think it's too late to ask for bus fare? We're robbing charities now? Try to think of it as, uh, eliminating the middle man. You sound rough. It's just a tickle. There's no Santuario Del Sol on this map. Excuse me, ma'am? Do you happen to have a local map? I can do much better. I have been to the church of Del Sol. My husband, he took me there may years past. What was it like? I scored a 45. Wow. How long have you been married? This October, 72 years. And what's your secret? Well, when one of you is dead... it's easy! Are you sure this is it? Abuela! I thought Javier was dead. If Javier would be here today, he would be standing... To thank you and to tell you how... How much we appreciate your friendship, and for... Your love! "Long live Javier!" Esperanza, I thought we were going to Del Sol... Oh, you shouldn't have! This isn't... this isn't Del Sol. Have you ever actually been to the Santuario, or...? Ay, my son! Drink your drink, smooth your shirt, Dance with your girlfriend and shut the hell up! I didn't know you were such a good dancer! You okay? Yeah, yeah I'll be fine. I'm just... uh... I'm a little winded. I'm just gonna sit this next one out. Okay. Yeah, yeah! Go ahead. That's not so bad! Aren't we getting a little old for the silent treatment? My pace too slow? I wouldn't want to hold you back. Maybe I should brush up my moonwalk skills. We were just dancing, Will. What, you think I'm jealous of some cardio freak With salsa hips? Well what's wrong then? Why? Hmmm? Just tell me why Hannah. Why are you always following me? What are you getting out of this? What do you want me to... say to that? Redemption? I'm your ticket to a clear conscious? I don't know what that means. You feel guilty about Bobby. I'm your surrogate sick boy. I'm here... Because no one should have to do this alone. This is penance. Do you have any idea what it's like to lie awake At night and listen to the sound of someone you love wheeze? To hate the sound so much, but you hate even more That you might not hear it the next day. You think it's easier being the healthy one? Yes. Bobby loved sneaking in to the hospital cafeteria at night. He'd steal these packs of paper plates and... He'd write these little slogans on them, like: "What you risk reveals what you value. " "Purple is black and blue. " Then he'd sneak the plates back in. He used to get a kick out of imagining some kid reading His words while he ate lunch. Then one day he just... He just stopped. I miss him too, Hannah. For a long time now. Are you sure? Are you? I'm not someone who can dance all night. Just breathe. Well... We made it this far. We won't let some little old gate hold us back. I guess so. This is Salvador's home. Uh, would you know where I could um... Well... he's here in jail, and he's pretty drunk. - We can work it out - - Really. If you come down here to the station. Yeah, yeah. Thank you officer. They're uh, they're holding him for a drunk and disorderly. I think they're fishing for a bribe. Well we got about 400 pesos. What's a miracle worth these days? So uh, you're a priest? Priest... Shaman, Don... Whatever. Look, we just, uh... We just need an hour of your time. No can do. The place closed. Closed? Cause of the weevils. What? They're these little beetle creatures That burrow in the dirt. Yeah, yeah, we know what a weevil is. But... how... How did they close Del Sol? Turf. The turf? The Astroturf. They treat it as a buffet. Weevils ate your Astroturf? It's like cotton candy to the little bastards! They love it. I had to plug all the holes. The mini-putt? What mini-putt? That's not why you're here? Why would I bribe someone out of jail to play mini-putt? I dunno. You was trying to impress the lady? What does this have to do with a healing shrine? Healing? Sick? No, it's... It's for a friend. He has, uh... He has cystic fibrosis. Oh the one, where you gotta crap in a bag? If I had to crap in a bag... I'd go looking for miracles too. No, we're just looking for Del Sol. I'm sorry Salvador, there must have been Some kind of mistake. It's all right. Thanks for the grub, though. Maybe there's another priest. Maybe Bobby is laughing his Jacob Marley ass off. Well, so we... We find someone else That knows about it... You know miracles, they don't tend to keep a low profile. Yeah? You spotted one lately? Hey! This friend of yours, um... Is he really sick? I mean we're not talking some uh... Little flu. Maybe there is something. Maybe. Got some cash? Let's go. I was one of the first to come here back in '76. Doctor gave me half a year. One dip in that pond, I felt consecrated. A bonafide miracle. So I stayed, Helped the priest who ran the place. They one day, the ol' bugger up and dies. Leaves it all to me. This kid, one day, she comes looking hard: All blonde hair and blue eyes and big hopes. She doesn't find her miracle. They blame me. I'm dumb enough to listen. I ended up selling the land. Watched them... turn it into a golf course for the in love And the mentally challenged. Hell, what's the difference? Then what happened? I got drunk. Maybe miracles... They're a bit like weather. Do a little jig, And if the storm comes... You call it a rain dance. If it don't... Well maybe you just keep dancing. Alright! Get out of here! Go! It's called... Santuario Del Sol. Yep. - It's a mini-putt. - For the walking dead. Believe it or not, the Sol church Used to be some sight, Before they turned it into a par five. Now, weevils! Healing time! It's... this way. This is the miraculous healing pond Of El Santuario Del Sol? Uh, don't let the algae fool you. There's still plenty of mojo under all that scum. How deep is this thing? As deep as you need it, boyo. It's like the earth puked. It wants to wake you up! Pass me the salt. And uh... We need four candles. Put them across from each other. Let's... heal... Now... We anoint... The body. So... Get naked. Huh? Look... I know this is not about some friend. You're sick, let's deal with it. Right here. Right now. In purity, we don't wear denim. Actually this... This is about a friend. And her brother. You want me to heal a cookie jar? Well it's an urn, technically. I don't know, guys. Your friend looks pretty far gone. We're not trying to bring him back to life. We're just... we're just doing what he asked us to do. I don't believe this. Oh, what the heck. Alright, let's just do it. We're here, right? Put it over here. Hold it. I hope you had a good trip, Bobby. Goodbye Bobby. Screw it. Will! He's not breathing! - No, no, no. - Salvador! No! Salvador I need your help! Salvador! You're gonna be okay. Okay, we need to, we need to get you dry. Come on. Here! Salvador! Our packs are in your truck! Let's go in, let's go in! We need to get you warm. No, no, no, no! Okay. Slow and steady, okay? In... Out. In... Out. In... Out. In... Out. In... Out. In... Out. Stay awake, Will! I - I can... I can't breathe. Will. Hang on. Let's go. Let's go! Let's take him to the clinic. Yeah, we're on our way there now. He's fading in and out. No, I don't know Fran. I don't... I don't know where... I'm gonna call you back from the clinic, okay? I'm gonna call you back from the clinic! I'm right here Will. Yeah, they're moving him now. We're taking him home. "Let it Last"] # Let it last # # this moment in our grasp # # Let the sun Stay right where it is # # Let us bask Let us bask # # in this time that moves so fast # # May you remain just as I see you now # # It's so sad It's so sad # # that the memories that I have # # Are the ones that I don't want back # # But it's alright, It's alright # # It's okay, yeah, It's okay # # Cause today was the day # # That the light hit you in a way # Hey!

Alive and well. I'll check back on you later. Hey. You sound better. I'm okay. Where's Hannah? She's here. We'll give you two a minute. Come on sweetheart. Hey you. El Santuario Del Sol. The land of miracles. Got you a souvenir. For what you did... Thank you. There's something you need to hear. "To Build a Home"] William. It's been a spell, I was starting to think - Epic story, Mr. Steadman. Well, you must be looking For some quality time with Angelica. Actually I just came in to tell you that, um... I think you can take my name off the mailing list. Oh? Have you decided to put a down payment On that Ferrari? No, I um... I'm saving up for something special. 30 seconds, 30 days... Or 30 years. They were all for you, Hannah. The question is not how we die... But how we live. For me that was easier said than done. It was like I spent most of my life Slowly drowning. And when I finally came up for that first breath, It tasted so sweet. It was like the most... Most precious thing in the universe. And now I can hold on to that breath forever.
