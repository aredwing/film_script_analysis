It was a dowry in marriage Panos with your mother. - Was married? - Yes, for a month. This is a copy the marriage license. Congratulations your heritage. This is great. Too bad I would not hold. This currency is the shit proof that my beach... ... And Michael Beach are archaeological sites. Please call the beaches Super Apollo and Apollo. I will appeal. Nobody I get to the beach. You know who I am? I have known the government! Over, Michael. I would say when he finished. Got it? Give your phone. Give the phone, Mori! Greek singer. I do this three times a week.
