If I can belt him solid just once! - What will he be doing in the meantime? - You don't understand! I understand that he's 23, and you're 35, Bill! Thirty-five in this business, you're an old man! Look, Julie, they're building this kid up, feeding him a lot of pushovers! If I get over him tonight, that'll mean a rematch! That's a semi wind-up, 150 guarantee! Maybe a top spot even! Top spot! Yeah, a top spot, and I'm just one punch away! I remember the first time you told me that! You were just one punch away from the title shot then! Don't you see, Bill? You'll always be just one punch away! Oh, Bill, it ain't I wanna hurt you! But what kind of a life is this? Springfield, Middletown, Unionville, Paradise City!

Don't you see what we could do with 500 bucks? I could get a piece of Tony Martinez! Best-looking middleweight I seen since Harry Greb! I'll train him myself! Or we could get a beer joint or maybe that cigar stand I told you about in Union City! I don't care about Martinez or cigar stands or anything else! It makes no difference to me if you go back to the docks or drive a garbage truck! - Or go on relief even! - Julie! It's better than having you with your brains knocked out!

He laid down when I clipped him! He was a sucker for a left! Everybody's a sucker for something! I knew I had him the first time I hit him in the gut! His belly was soft, like mush! I kept hammering the same spot! And every time my mitt sinks deeper and deeper! You should've heard him grunt the last time! I thought I went right through him, like jelly! Shanley, you're on! - What's the matter with him? - Got me! First pro fight! - I'll be right back! - Okay, but make it snappy! - Come on, come on! Let's have that Shanley! - Okay!

Nineteen hundred and twenty-eight! Trenton! Yeah, Trenton, New Jersey! That was 20 years ago! Okay, Tony, let's fix up the eyes! That's it, Gunboat! Give me a hand, will you? I'm in a hurry! - You ought to see the mouse I got outside! - Mouse! - Don't you ever think about anything else? - What else is there? - Ain't that right? - Hold your hand still! Wait till you see this one! - Like a brick battleship! - Mouse! What's the matter with mice? They're all for you as long as you're in the chips! I never seen a dame yet that's still around when you hit the skids! - Cut it out, you guys, will you? - I didn't know you worried about dames! I said, cut it out! - Sell 17, 23, 29, 32! - That's it! I'm out! How much I owe you? Gunboat, get ready! Gunboat! I told you to get ready! All right, hold it! Take a deep breath! Once more! All right! Right there, son! - How you feeling, son? - Feel? Okay, doc! Okay! Just like Frankie Manila! Twenty-one times! It's in the record book, ain't it, Stoke? - What's in the record book? - Twenty one times, that's what Frankie done! Twenty-one times he got licked! Couldn't get a fight! Even here! 21 times! Just a pushover! Remember? Ain't got your gloves on yet, Gunboat! Get up here! Manila never had no chance, no! He got dumped 21 times! You better get your gloves on, Gunboat! Your deal! That makes it $2 you owe me! Take it easy, take it easy! Don't wear yourself out! You got four rounds to do out there! All the fight news and pictures! Get your Knockout! - Hiya, Julie! - Hello, Bat! - Ain't you going in? - No! No, sir! Frankie never had no chance! Just a workout! The champ wasn't even gonna get up a sweat! Twenty-one times, Manila got beat! Yeah, and that's 21 times you told us about it! So what? So what? So he wound up middleweight champion of the world! He sure did, Gunboat! Sure did! Can't you see me, Stoke? First, I win the title! And then the exhibition tour! That's where the easy dough is! I'll be in the movies, Stoke, with a line of dames waiting for me a block long! You need any help with those dames, let me know! Save it for out there, Pop! You'll need it! - Johnson and Joyce, get warmed up! - Attaboy, kid! - Good going! - Thanks! - You got the first one! - Yeah, in the second round! - Third spot, upstairs! - Nice going, kid! - Next bout! - That's you, Gunboat! I'm going! Twenty-one times, and he winds up champion of the world! Right, Stoke? Right! I guess you can only stop so many! Yeah! - Let's go, Luth! - See you, guys! Just a little cocoa butter, Gus!

The way to go to heaven! - You don't think there might be a heaven? - How do you know there is? I don't know about you, Mickey, but me, I'm a gambling man! I play percentages! I say there's a price on everything, even heaven! You're punchy! It's a short-ender, sure! The odds are a million to one! A guy would be a sucker not to take them kind of odds, huh? You kidding? Using the Bible for a scratch sheet? This ain't a scratch sheet, Mickey! This is the future book! How do you like that guy? Making book on the hereafter! Oh, I don't know! Everybody makes book on something! Lonesome? Hey, you like dancing? Want a cigarette? You know, you look like you like dancing! - worn out from throwing those punches. The old man keeps coming back for more. - Bet you do a mean rumba! - Beat it! - Don't...? - I said, beat it! - to the jaw. It nearly tore his head off. He's down. He's out like a light. The referee is counting him out. Four, five... Aw, it's just a formality. He might as well count up to 100. Nine, ten, out. That's it, ladies and gentlemen. He still hasn't moved. The time, one minute and 38 seconds in the second round. By a knockout, Tommy Joyce stops Gunboat Johnson in the second round. Let me tell you exactly what happened in that round. What's the matter, lady? Too rough for you? - last left hook of his had Gunboat groggy at the end of round one. So he just bored in, throwing everything he had... I read you're going East if you beat Bastogne! - That's no if, Gus! - Supposed to be pretty good! He won the intercollegiate a couple years ago? I never seen a college Joe yet take a belt on the kisser without phoning his mother! He's a good man, but I'll take him! I can feel it! Yeah, Gus! The trip's all set!

A fight's only a fight! - I still got that million-to-one shot! - Okay, boys! Main event on! - Get ready, main event! - Luth! Intermission's about over! Hey, Mickey! Give Stoker a hand with his bandages! Main event in the ring! I wish I had the champ in there tonight! I know I'm right, Gus! Tell you, I can feel it! - Okay, boy! Now, let's go! - Good! - Luth, let's go home early! - Why not? It only takes one! I tell you, Tiny, you got to let him in on it! There's no percentage in smartening up a chump! - But what if he gets in a lucky punch? - Stick to your buckets! I'll do the thinking! - You ready, Stoker? - Never felt better! Good! Let's go!
