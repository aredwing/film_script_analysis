I'm coming, I'm coming. Okay. Balloon wrangler. Thank you. Watch her head. Watch her head. I'm watching her head, Laila. Ow! Congratulations. That went well. It's fine, it's fine. All right, Frannie. You're all right, honey. Give me your hand. We're going to get you out of this cab. Come on. We're so close. I got you. We're so close. Oh, hey, look at that. Leaning on the door. Okay, ready? Quick.

Look at that! And look at that. Okay. You should have just come to live with me. Why... We're going to be fine. Really? In a four-story walk-up. A four-story walk-up. I don't know how they can let people just leave on their own without any help. It's crazy. What is she supposed to have? A police escort? Well. Come on. - No. - Yes, you have to. Watch this. I'm going to be right here. Look, it's me. Hi! I got you. Got it? Okay, Laila, lift her. Okay. On three, you guys. Watch your back! One, two, three. Whee! Yay! Attagirl! You are... Okay, okay, okay. This is really the worst thing that has ever happened to me. Let's just take a little break. Here we go. You're doing great. Why don't you put down that frigging plant? Can't just leave it in the hallways. There's no way we can get her up there. No way. You guys, I'm really tired. Oh, let's ask him for help. No... Oh. Is he the one with the...? Yeah, he's an asshole. He looks strong. Oh, my God. I hate him. - You got her? - Yeah. Good. Excuse me. Um, I was just wondering if you could give us a hand for a sec. What? Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know if you noticed. Like, we could really use an extra pair of hands. I'm sorry, I got to get to work. She... She got hit by a car. We just brought her home from the hospital. We could really use an extra pair of hands here. What do you want me to do? Well, I don't know. Uh, okay, what is...? Hi. By the way, you're very loud. Really? Um, what if... What if you, like, leaned back? What if she leaned back, you know, and then... You know, just like leaned back. Hey! No, no, no... And then we could help her hop. Really? Just going to help her hop. Wait, wait, wait. You know what? I know what we're going to do. Okay. Sorry. I got it. Ah! Yeah. Do it like this. Please lord Jesus. Oh, God... Yeah. Got it. Oh... Aah! Aah! Easy, easy, easy. Easy. Okay. Focus. Right here. You're on my ass. There you go. Easy, easy. Ah... Ah... Easy, easy, easy. He got you. All right. Fuck me. What a champ. That was a really great... Okay. Thanks so much. He doesn't look so good. Listen, I filled your whole fridge full of food. Really good stuff. Don't worry about it. It's on me. Henry and I moved everything around, so it's within arm's reach... Wait, where's my didgeridoo? That thing went to Housing Works. Oh, no, thanks. I got to go. I totally told you I had to go. Oh. I told you that. I can show you the email. What... Okay. - We went through this already. - Yeah, but that's totally... Don't fight. Please don't fight, you guys. I'll put the ice in the thing. That needs to be changed every three hours. Yeah, we all got the lesson. We were all there. It's good. Wow. Okay. Well, why don't I just... Okay. ...put the instructions on the fridge so we'll have them, in case anyone forgets. Hey, when is the, um, PT nurse person coming? She's starting tomorrow. Every other day. All right. All right. Everything's okay. I'm going to see you tonight after 6:00, okay? Everything's going to be fine. Just in case you change your mind, my offer still stands. Please come and stay with me. We would love to have you. Thank you. All right? Sweetie? Okay, so you've been really great. And you too. Um, call me later. Thank you. Go. I have so much room. - We're kind of rich. - We're good. - Bye. - Okay. Bye, you guys. Shh, shh. She's the worst! Oh, my God. The worst! Can you imagine? What? Living with your sister. Oh! Trapped, defenceless in New Jersey. I would shoot myself in the face. Oh, my God. Don't worry. You don't need her. We're all going to take care of you. Thanks. Are you hungry? No. No? I'm not going to eat for the next three months. I don't want to get fat. Smart. Thank you. Hey. Yeah, I'm at Frannie's. I told you that. Tell him I said hi. What's the matter? Uh, around 5:00. I can be home at 5:00, right? Mm-hmm. What do you mean you want to talk to me? Well, what do you mean? Why does it have to wait? That's so weird and mysterious. You're freaking me out. What do you mean? Well, why can't you just tell me now? Okay, so it's bad then. You're going to tell me something bad. What, are you going to break up with me or something? I can't believe this is happening! Four fucking years, and this is how you end it?! I thought we were going to get married! I thought... I thought this was it. He wants to be with this girl at his job! Oh, God! You stay here. No! No! I'm here for you. I know. Actually, I kind of can't really concentrate on anything else. I'm not going to eat... I'm just going to take a couple of these for the road. Okay. I'm so sorry! Okay. You call me. I love you so much! I will. I'm so sorry. You let me... I'm sorry, baby. I'll call you later. Okay, you call me. Okay, bye. Are you kidding me? Hey, Jason. It's me again. What's up? I'm just calling to check in. Um... you give me a call? Okay. Love you. Bye. Fallon, come on! Hurry up! I got to take a dump, and there's no way I'm going in that fucking pan. Frannie? Yeah? It's Rachel. I... I work with Fallon. Is it okay if I come...? Yeah. Yeah. Hi. I'm so sorry. Fallon had to run home. A pipe broke in her house. So she sent you? I know. This is so weird, right? I'm so sorry. Why didn't she call me? I'm sorry. She had to run out. I know she felt real bad about it. Um... can I maybe... help you with something? Okey-doke. Okay, um, please... just don't look down. Okay? Oh, yeah. Just... No, I'll look up. I'm going to take my pants down. Oh, my God. I'm taking my pants down. It's okay. I'm not looking... Please. I have to give you my crutch. Okay. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. You stay with me. Okay. Stay with me. You're not staying with me. I am. Okay, you stay with me. You stay with me... Ah! Go. Thank you. Uh, all right. Bye-bye. Thank you very much. Thank you! Just shut the door behind you! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. So, you know that asshole neighbour? Mm-hmm. He's making noise again. It started, like... Like, it's like in... It was in the bathroom... Okay. Is there anything else you need me to do before I go? Oh, hey, how's your pain? Totally hurts all the time. So, uh, be sure and give me a call after the PT nurse gets here, okay? - I got to get off to work. - What? Wait. You... You can't stay? Oh, no, sweetie. I got to go. Okay. Okay, bye. Bye. I... How are you going to buzz her in? I have no idea. I don't know. I guess I'll just get up and do it. I'm going to order you a wheelchair. Right? Right. Because you could wheel yourself to the door. Hey, did I... Did you hear about the devil? Yes. We talked about it. We did? Yeah. Before the accident. Isn't that insane? It was like $6 million. Okay. Frannie, please do not obsess about him. I'm... Please. Please. Sometimes bad things happen to good people. And good things happen to bad people. There's nothing we can do about it. We just try and act a little dignified, okay? Great. I got to go. I love you. Bye. Topped with caramelized pecans. Then the strawberries that we cut up just soaking in that sugar, that natural sweetness, just coming out from the strawberry and the juice. Oh! I can just taste it. You can also use this on pound cakes, cereal, banana splits and... I hate you. I hate you. Ha! Ha! Huh? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Ah, ah. Oh, fuck! Oh! I'm going to kill you! Ow! Okay... Can you please lower your fucking music? Jesus Christ. Hey! And keep it lower, okay? So I don't have to come back here again. It's the middle of the afternoon. It's not like it's 2:00 in the morning. You going to argue with me? Crippled lady in the hallway? Huh? Fine. And you know what else? Hey! You have to come make me a sandwich. So, um, what is up with all the music and the grunting? Are you, like, exercising? None of your business. Well, you don't have to be rude about it. How am I rude? Because I don't want to haul you up five flights of stairs? Or, like, talk about what I do inside my own home? Yeah. For starters. Why? So that then you can call me every day and be like, "I am so sorry, I really am so sorry, but can you buy me some toilet paper?" Or, like, "Oh, hey, do you want to watch TV with me? I'm so lonely." You know what? You're... You're awful. You know what? I have a mom and a crazy sister I have to worry about, all right? I have an old aunt who lives in Connecticut who I never get to visit, all right? And, yeah, when I get home I want to work out like an animal. So why should I care about some injured neighbour who doesn't have anybody to take care of her? I have people to take care of me. Okay? Really. Yeah. Really. I could be living in New Jersey right now if I wanted to, with my sister, but I am choosing to be independent. Yeah, very independent. Knock, knock. "Hey, stranger, make me a sandwich." I was hit by a car! Okay? Jesus Christ, I just... Forgive me for wanting to be in my own home. And my friends said that they would help me. But they don't want to help you. Yes, they... They're just being nice. They want to go to the movies, or they want to go out to eat, or whatever other fun things they do. Just not sitting here with you. Because everyone's just trying to squeeze out a little happiness from life, or just get some boring shit done. And the last thing they want is someone getting in their way. When someone asks me to do them a favour, it feels like they're literally sucking the air out of my lungs. Like they're trying to steal my life. Go. Goodbye. At least I'm honest. Hey. Oh, hey. Um, you know, I've been thinking. Yeah. Yeah. Um... you know, maybe it would be better if I just... You know, if I just came to New Jersey. What, uh... What made you change your mind? Just, um... You know, I realized it was kind of selfish of me to, you know, want to be here... inconveniencing everyone. No, but seriously, you know that, uh, that pipe that burst in the den, right? Yeah. Right, so that's being torn up. So, uh, you'd have to s-stay in the living room. Okay. But it'll be so fun either way, right? The kids are going to be so happy to have you there. So I'll see you tonight. Actually, no. Jason's coming over tonight. So I'm good to go. Okay. See you in the morning. Okay. Bye. You cannot stay with your sister. You can't do it. You need to maintain your own person space. Really? Is it that terrible an idea? Montclair? In her living room. Honey, no. No, I'm going to second him. No. There's no fucking way I'm letting you go to Montclair. That's like the worst idea I've heard this entire year. Absolutely not. Really? I'm sorry, what is your name again? Lawrence. Hi. Hi. Where's your bathroom? Um, it's right there. Thanks. Thank you. You go, girl. Oh, my God. Jase... Oh, no, no, no. Okay, I'm sorry. You knew you were coming. You're supposed to give me a sponge bath. I know. Things happen, and they changed. Did you meet him on Grinder? What? You met him on Grinder. I was online for two minutes, and his headline was "cutie with a booty." It just drew me right in. Jason! Look at me. I can't meet a new gay looking like this. Look, I'm in a garbage bag! So what? Whatever, like we care. Look. Jason, please don't take your pants off. Okay, I won't. I'm sorry. Can I say something? What? He's really cute though, right? : And so nice! He's so fucking nice. So cute, his little eyes. He's so cute I'm going to punch him in the face! I love him. How cute is that? Hi. You're supposed to give me a sponge bath. What? I'm going to give you a sponge bath. I smell like a... I'm so sorry. I could help. I had a grandma, she lived to be 102. You know what? He could help. He had a grandma, 102. He used to give sponge baths to his grandmother. So we'll give you a sponge bath together. It's perfect! You guys, please. I'm good. I can do it myself. I'm good. I love you. I loved meeting you. I am... I'm good. All right. Okay, okay. Okay, fine. You know what? Let's go. We'll go. Oh, my God! What? The devil. Frannie had this boyfriend, okay? Took care of him for two years. Colon cancer. Oh, my God. Through the whole thing. And then you know what? He broke up with her. No. Yeah. He did. Yeah, and now he just sold some kind of like techie thingy. Well, I mean, obviously... I mean, who isn't selling a techie thingy? He's all over the Internet. It's literally multi millions of dollars. It's not really that big. My whole point is... All I'm saying is you're being a little dramatic right now. It's not that big of a deal. You are going through it. Right? Hello? Hey, Devon. Frannie? Yeah. It's me, Frannie. Hi. Um, what are you...? Yeah, I know. I know, it's kind of late. I'm sorry. I just... Um, I wanted to talk. You want to talk now? Uh, no. Um... no. Uh, can... Well, in person. Can I talk to you tomorrow? Um, sure. Okay. I can do it after work. Yeah. Okay. Okay. But you're going to have to come, um, to my place. Is... Is that cool? Okay. I'm not sure... That's okay. You know what? I can... I'll text you the address. Okay? Okay. Are you sure you're okay? Am I okay? Yeah. I mean, no. I mean, yeah. Uh... okay. Um... sorry, so I'll see you around 6:00. Cool. Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. Good night. Okay. Fuck. Okay. Hold on. Go back. Aah! I'll be right there! Hi. Uh, hi. So, the big sale. Congratulations. Oh, thanks. You've been working on that forever. Yeah. And you still have that girlfriend? Yeah. What is her name again? Jodi. Right. Jodi. Ow. Sorry. How long has it been? Two years. Wow. That's awesome. Hey, how great to know she's not with you just for your money. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Um... listen, I'm really sorry about all this. Yeah. I know you must be wondering why I called you, like, just to come stare at me in my bed. No, I mean... No, I'm glad you told me. Yeah. I bet. Uh... gosh. Uh... That's all it was. I just wanted you to know for some reason. Okay. Thank you. I'm glad I know. Well, I should probably be going. Of... Yeah. Yeah. Get out of here. I have dinner plans with Jodi, so... Of course. Of course. This is not fun. Where are you going? Uh, where? Yeah, what restaurant? Oh, Loy. Loy? I've never been to Loy. It's good. I mean, it's for our anniversary. Two years. Wow. Don't be late. Um, so I'll see you soon. Okay. And, you know, call me if you need anything. What? What did you say? What? "Call me if you need anything." Really? That's amazing. What do you mean? What am I supposed to say? That's it? You want money. I knew it. That's what Jodi said it probably was. Is that what she said? That's great. No, I didn't say I wanted money, Devon. No, but what else could it be? You call me up right after my deal is announced. Jesus, Frannie, if you want money... You know what? I want you to take care of me. What? That's what I want, okay? I want you to take care of me the way that I took care of you. Come on. Um, I know you have people in your life that can do that for you. Sure, here and there, if they can fit me in. But I'm not anyone's priority. Okay. Well... some things never change, I guess. And what is that supposed to mean? You've always been a little... You know, you get dramatic sometimes. Oh, really? Yeah, I'm sorry. Was I dramatic ever the entire time I took care of you? Hmm? Did I ever feel sorry for myself? Did I ever make it about me? No, but I just don't understand what you want me to do. Want me to change my entire life around and take care of you? What do I tell Jodi? What do I tell my partners? This is pathetic. I'm not going to beg you to help me. So, uh, go to Loy and just forget me losing two years of my life taking care of you. At your side, every moment in the hospital, at every doctor's visit. I lost a tooth because I didn't go to the dentist. Remember? My bottom second molar? That's gone. Fine. That ship has sailed. Fine! I owe you everything, okay? Everything. What do you want me to do? What do you need? Hi. Hey. Sorry I'm late. I'm I ordered us a bottle of wine. It's a Chteauneuf-du-Pape 1984. That's good, right? Yeah. Oh. It's our anniversary, so... Yeah, that... That was a great choice. Um, just tell me. What... What did she want? Money, right? I knew it. People are so predictable. Well, uh, she is... She was in a car accident. Oh. Bad? Yeah. She broke an arm and her leg. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Jodi. Now I feel so bad. I was getting so jealous. Oh, oh. I know, I know. That is... That's my issue. And I promise I will work on it. But knowing that you were seeing her... you know, the one who took care of you. Oh, that. Yeah. It's... But I wish I was the one who took care of you then. Trust me, you don't. I know, but it must be such a special bond you share. I hate it. Are you going to give her some? I don't know. What do you think? Um... I think you should. Poor thing. Arm and a leg. I mean, not a lot but, you know, why not? So tomorrow after work, we'll come and pick you up and get you packed. And we'll get you down the stairs in a wheelchair. Or the crutches. Doesn't matter. Henry's really strong. Actually, I kind of don't need to do that anymore. What? Why? I spoke to Devon, and he's going to help me. What? Yeah. He agreed to be my primary caregiver. You're off the hook. Devon? Yes. "Devon" Devon? "Yeah" yeah. How'd that happen? I don't know. I guess he heard what happened. Called and offered. Isn't that nice of him? So the devil's going to take care of you. Mm-hmm. Like in the mornings? Yeah. During the day. Lunchtime. Nighttime? Six to ten, Monday through Friday. Won't sleep over. For how long? We agreed to a month, but we'll renegotiate after that. Oh, he's going to take me to my doctor's appointment next week, so I'll have a better idea after that what's up. You know, I didn't have a problem taking care of you. I know, but you don't have to. Okay. You know what? You're not going to be... He's not going to be able to... I already gave him a key. ...make him a key. Like that? Mm-hmm. Okay. Is there anything else? Can I have a Sprite? Sure. In a sippy cup with some ice would have been nice. Okay. Thanks. So, is that it, or...? We agreed that you'd talk to me for 10 minutes. Oh. Right. You could ask me about my pain level. Okay. How is your pain level? Like a 6. Mm-hmm. Is that in your arm or you leg? Both. Uh-huh. Did you take a pain medication? I can't. Not for an hour. Oh, wow. Someone's disciplined. Or someone's got a crazy drunk mother. Right. And how is Patty? Oh, useless. She lives in San Francisco with some guy. Well, at least she's someone else's problem now. Right. God forbid someone's a burden on someone. Yuck. Nope, that's not what I meant at all. No, it's okay. You know, I think I'm pretty good here, so it's okay. Okay? Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Oh, my God. Aah! How does this feel? It doesn't feel good. Yeah, no, dummy. Your ex-boyfriend. Forcing him to take care of you. Oh, that. That feels pretty good. What? Nothing. What? It's just... What? When he was sick, why did you take care of him? Because he was my boyfriend, and... And I... Because I loved him. Okay, so I know we don't love each other anymore. I know that. But still... Look, it's the... It is the right thing to do. Whatever. I... picked up the, uh, pills and, uh... and the prunes. Thank you. Dinner? Yeah. Um, I'll have an apple. An apple? Orange is too complicated. I don't want to get fat, so I'm not eating. Okay. Uh, listen, I have a bunch of interviews I have to do in a half-hour because of everything that's going on, so... Yeah, that's cool. Do what you got to do, man. Okay. Thank you. When it's time, I'll just... Yeah. So... how was, um... How was last night? Last night? Yeah. Dinner with Paul. Were you guys all celebrating? Like cigars, and cognac, and girls all around and stuff? What? Hmm? You said that you were at Soho House with the partners. There's so many Eurotrash sluts there. Listen, um... Hmm. I didn't tell you the truth. What? Oh, my God. My heart is racing. What? You... I didn't know how you'd react, but I realize now it's stupid. It is not a big deal. You will see that it is not a big deal. What? Um... you know Frannie. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I didn't tell you the truth. She didn't want money. What... What did she want? She wants me to take care of her. What? So that's what I did last night. I went over there and I kept her company. I don't even know what... Okay, you lied to me. So that's devastating. Let's start with that. That you're a guy that lies. No, I couldn't lie. That's why I'm telling you the truth now. No, Devon, you could, because you did and I believed you. So, um, just are you a serial killer as well? Because I clearly would have no idea. You said you were getting jealous. I... Oh, you're going to blame me? No, no. Is that...? And then you tell me... No, no. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied. ...you're taking care of her? I don't... Um, for how long? Maybe a month. Maybe more. A month. So you will be spending every moment of your free time with her? It may be more than a month. She does realize you're not her boyfriend anymore, right? Yes. Huh. She sounds crazy. Listen, I don't want to go into how much she helped me. I'm sorry, who does this? Who asks their old boyfriend... She was there for me... ...to disrupt his... She sounds crazy. I'm sorry, is she crazy? No, she's a little needy. Not crazy. I hated that it was her that got you through the cancer. I hate it. Come on. This is weird. I know. This is really weird. I know. I'm freaking out. No, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait, does this mean you won't be able to see Book of Mormon on Tuesday? Oh, goddamn it! I'm amazing. I'm amazing, and chicks dig me. You're healing so nicely, it's bananas. I told you. How's the pain? It's bad. I warned you, right? I know you did. When do you think she'll be able to, you know, walk again? That's hard to say. Hard to say? Got a ballpark? Everyone's different. Right. That's why I said a ballpark. Devon. I think you can rush it and have a setback, erase the brilliant work I've done here. Or you can go one day at a time, which I believe is the healthier course of action and then you're going along as if nothing has happened, and suddenly, boom, the brace is gone and you're done. Right. And when approximately do you think that might be? Devon, obviously Dr. Leonard doesn't feel comfortable making... Well, I'll... I'll tell you. Here's what I'm comfortable saying to you. Anywhere between six weeks and 27 years. Does that work for you? Listen, I know this can be tough on a relationship. Oh, no, no, no. We're... We're not... Yes, this can be tough on a relationship. Well, I should probably go now. We're done. You're doing great. Really great. Thank you, Dr. Leonard. You're a peach. You're like my personal hero right now. Do you realize that? You're the hero of women everywhere. I wish I could take a picture of your face and put it on a T-shirt and wear it around everywhere. You're like a superhero. I mean, if I could get lying, cheating dickweeds to help me. Well, I wouldn't... If I could make them come here and cook me dinner every night. Make me breakfast every morning. Crawl on his hands and knees... Hey, I got to go. Bye. Hello. Hi. What do you need? The bathroom? Uh, no. Carrots and celery? Sure. Thanks. Hey, you know what? Um... Forget it. Excuse me? Just, I... Yeah, you... You don't... You don't have to, um... You don't have to take care of me anymore, okay? Really? Yeah. I get it. So I... understand. It's... It's... It's... It's not appropriate. Yeah. I knew you'd see this is crazy. It was, I mean, I... I... guess I was crazy to think that you would be able to be gracious about this. Okay. Two years, lost my job to help keep you alive. You're in my apartment for two days making phone calls. Whatever. Really? We're gonna go there? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Losing that job was the best thing that ever happened to you. My getting sick was the best thing that ever happened to you. What? Yeah. You were working as a paralegal. You hated it. You didn't know what the hell else you were going to do with your life. I believe it was, um, "I want to open a gym." Then it was, "I want to write about spas." And then it was, "I want to go to law school." When I got sick... You're incredible. ...it's like this entirely different woman emerged. You became organized. You became focussed. You finally had something important and worthwhile to do. So I should be thanking you for giving me the profound experience of taking care of you. Huh! Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'm curious. How long did it take you to spin that one, Devon? You know it's true. Are you kidding me? The thrush, and the infection in the porch, and the blockage, and... And... And that doctor who wouldn't write the script for two weeks. And... And your fucking stinky old uncle and his patchouli, and his fucking crystals, and me telling him off, and that emergency surgery, and every day there was something else. And then you left. Oh, Jesus Christ. Do you know how sick I am of hearing how I'm like Satan because I did that to you? Even my friends are telling me that. Yes, yes. Yes, you were there for me every single day. Every single night you helped me. You never complained. And when I would try to thank you for it, you would say, "If the situation was reversed, you would do the same thing for me." And deep down I didn't know if that was true, because I didn't know if I was that good of a person. Fuck! Please let me help. Shit. Okay. Okay. This whole not-eating thing is fucking crazy. I'm going to make you dinner. You don't have to. I'm going to make you dinner. Hi. How was your night? Good. Boring. Seriously, how can you still watch this? Haven't you seen every episode like 50 times? Yeah. But now I can see the murder in the first minute and remember who did it. So, like, a guy just got thrown out of a moving car shot. Let me think. He is a shock jock. Everybody hates him. Lots of suspects. Joe Piscopo did it. Wow, I am so sad for you. It calms me somehow. Oh. Hey, are you still good at recognizing the voices? Yes. Go. Lili Taylor. No, it's... Oh, my God. It is. Mm-hmm. Yup. I still got it. Oh. Whoa. Wow. Hi. Hi. Ugh. I know. Sorry I'm late. Chicken pad thai? So... what was it like... Mm-hmm? ...when you heard Yahoo wanted to buy your software? Mmm. Well, I had just come out of Barneys. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Okay. Jodi and I were arguing about the suit that she wanted me to buy. I thought it was too expensive. Well, hello? Barneys. Yeah, I know. Um, and then Jodi offered to buy it for me, because she's the one with the... Well, ahem, she has money. And I was like, "No way. Like, let's just go across the street to Men's Wearhouse." And she was like, "Really? Men's Wearhouse?" We were fighting a little bit about it. And when my phone rang, it was my partner Lance. And he told me that Yahoo wanted to make the deal... for $6 million. Holy shit. Please tell me that you walked back in and you bought that suit. Yeah, I did. Ugh! Did you call your mom? Yes. Did she start crying hysterically? Yeah. And did she talk about the cancer and how far you've come since then, how maybe it was all meant to be? Wow, you're good. Oh, well, Teri and I were in the trenches together. Yeah. Do Teri and Jodi... get along? They don't really know each other. Really. Yeah. Why? I don't know. I just, you know, like to keep my mom separate from things these days because she gets, you know, so emotional. Yeah. Listen, people take breaks in between sets. I've seen Pumping Iron. Oh, you've seen Pumping Iron. Yes. Well, then you know in order to keep a great physique, you need to keep on going, Fran. You need to continue to push it. Let's go. Come on, keep working, Frannie. I'm so proud of you. I believe in you. Do it! Do it, or you're going to be a quitter like... What the fuck? I hate his face. All right, um, yeah. Let's shake it out, shake it out. Kiwis, broccoli... Dude, this is my camp shirt. ...strawberries. Why do you have my camp shirt? Brussels sprouts. Excuse me, miss. I've been looking for this. Red bell peppers. This was, like, the most important summer of my life. What? This is like, I fell in love for the first time this summer... What? I can't hear you. Undoubtedly. I'm keeping this. What? Okay, here we go. Mother and daughter. Hit and run. Oh! Cash in the car real estate fraud. January Jones. Only one way to find out if you're right. Want to make a bet? Totally, I'd do it. How much you want? Six million dollars. Hi. Hi. How was your night? Good. Oh, um, I want to meet her. Who? Really? Meet? Yeah. Yeah. I think it makes sense, doesn't it? For us to meet. Someone who you're spending so much time with. Yeah, that totally makes sense. Um, she's in a pretty vulnerable place right now. It might be kind of weird. You know, you standing around, staring at her in her bed. It's kind of weird. Well, I wouldn't be staring at her. Um, but it's okay for it to be weird for me, but not for her? No. You're all protective of her weirdness, but not me. No. No, no, no. You're right. You guys should totally meet. It will be good. It'll be good. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. Good. It'll be fine. Yeah. Don't get nervous. Why? Why? Why do I have to meet her? I know it's weird, but... What? Why? I thought you said she was fine. She is, she is. I mean, what do you mean? She just wants to... Like what? Check me out? Come on. You have to admit... Couldn't you just take a photo? This situation is kind of weird. Fine! Fine. When do I have to meet her? I'm so sorry. Are you kidding me? No, no, no, no. No, it's not funny. Stop laughing. I thought it would be best just to rip the Band-Aid off. You know that I am completely defenceless. And I look like shit. What? Nothing! I cannot be... Hey, Devon! This is not part of the deal. We never talked about this. Okay, the deal... The deal is fucking crazy. We're going to make the deal whatever we want to make it. I hate you. I just want you to know that. Shh! Shut your mouth. Oh, God... Ow! Mother... Ow. Fucking... So stupid. Hi. Okay, it's just straight back here. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Hey! Jodi, this is Frannie. Frannie, this is Jodi. This is a great opportunity for you guys to meet each other. I've heard so much. Yeah, and hey, I'm so sorry that this happened to you. Thank you. It's so horrible. I thank you. I brought cupcakes and ice cream. Why did I do this? Oh! Um, junk food always cheers me up. That's really nice of you. Thank you. Put it in the kitchen. I'll put them in the kitchen. Okay. Wow. Look at him. Okay. Mr. Host. I'm sorry. Please, sit. Okay. Sure. So... Hi. Hi. I know this might be a little weird. No. My God, are you kidding? It totally makes sense. Good. Yeah. I mean, if my boyfriend was suddenly like, "Hey, by the way, I'm going to..." Right? Oh, I'm so glad you understand. Yeah, I totally get it. Really. So Devon didn't tell me, um, what do you do for a living? Or did do...? I-I do... what I do do, um, is I'm a special events coordinator. Really? Yeah, at this PR firm. Oh, wow. So, yeah. They've been really great about holding my job for me. Oh, good. Oh, wow. Yeah. Um, PR sounds great. Yeah. You know, it... It is pretty great. I've been doing it for the past couple years, so it still feels kind of new. What kind of events do you do? Um, fashion shows and benefits and big corporate meetings. Oh, wow. Yeah, stuff like that. Ooh! That's really impressive. Um... So, what do you guys do all night? Um, well, just... we watch TV. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Okay. He doesn't... Well, okay, he doesn't make you watch the History Channel night and day? Or sports? Gosh. I think he knows I'm in enough pain already. Here, take some more pills. Kill myself. Um, so... Should we watch TV? Yes. Yes. Do you want... Are you sure? Yeah. I mean, I love it. I love TV. Totally. Obsessive. Wow. Ooh. You know your way around her TV. It's a remote. Yeah. Just like we have at home. Uh-oh. Careful, Dev. It's Law & Order. You better... What? Devon never lets me watch this. Hates it. Hates it. Really? Yeah. Yes. He does? Look at you watching it. I'm very proud. Oh, well. He says just the sound of their voices makes his brain cells start to die. Is that what... Really? Mm-hmm. Oh, sorry. One sec. Ugh. Billy Crudup. You know, I'm going to go. Really? Yeah. Oh, my God. I know, this is so boring. No, no, no, no. I'm so sorry. Please, this is my... No. It's okay. Yeah, honey, whatever you want. Whatever you want. All right. Are you... Well, it was really... It was so nice to meet you. So nice to meet you. And so nice to meet you. Listen, I hope that you get better really soon. Oh! Oh. I mean, that... That sounded weird. I know what you were thinking. Stop it. It's fine. Okay. Sorry I can't walk you out. Okay. Thanks a lot. Okay, thank you. Bye. It was nice to meet you. Bye, Frannie. Ever want to watch Law & Order, you know where I am. Bye! Bye. Hey... That was good, right? : You did great. Okay. Great. All right. Bye. She's really pretty. Mm-hmm. She is nice. Good. I'm glad you think so. Yeah, that was good to meet her. I'm happy you suggested it. In sickness and in health. Hmm? You never really think about it, but I got to see you... What you would be like. It's nice. I love you so much. I love you too. But don't you agree that that's what is happening? Like, everybody's gluten-free. What happened? All of a sudden there's like some thing where all the wheat in the world has gone bad? I'm going to test your reflexes. You have nothing. You're dead. Good. That's really good. That's progress. Right? That's good. But, um, you... You don't have a... A time frame. Oh, no, no. It's okay. Oh, no, no. I don't have that. Day by day. That's all I can tell you. That's all you should concentrate on. Right? I'll race you down the block. Dr. Leonard! What? The comedy is free. I only charge for this. Okay, well, you guys take no-fault insurance, right? So... Wait, wait, wait. When she bought this from you you took no-fault insurance, and now, weeks later you just... What, you just don't anymore? Okay. Yeah. Uh, you know what? Do you have any idea if there's anybody near you who sells a model like this that does take no-fault insurance that I might be able to call...? Hello? Did you hang up? Mother... Hey, Devon? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? It'll relax you. Pull. Oh! Oh, crap. You win. Okay, let's do it again. Pull. Just lower. That was lower. Oh! How many fingers am I holding up? Here, you want to do it? Come on. Yeah, I mean, I think I could do it. I'm going to get it... I really... Don't... Isn't this fun? Okay, ready? Come on. Aah! So close. Okay, do it again. Yeah. My God, you know what I would do? I would... What? Oh, my God. That was so awesome. So good. Pull. Oh, shit. I need my hair washed. I'll do it. What? Yeah, why not? Wait, wait, wait. Really? For real? Yeah. You can't wear those glasses though. You... It's not... That's... Can we... Oh, God! Jesus! Sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Can I... Can I just have a... Yeah. Thank you. Are you looking at my boobs? No. Yes, you are! Jesus Christ! No. Such a perv. Okay, will you just... Okay, here's what I'm requesting. Will you just, like, scrub a little? Yeah. And massage, if you will. Yeah. Can you scrub a little harder? Harder? Okay. Yeah. Like I'm at the salon. This is so dumb. Holy shit. That feels so good. Good. Hi. Hi. What? I need to talk to you. Oh, my God. What? I hated being sick. Well, yeah. Duh. No. No. There was no life lesson, and I didn't become like this wise person who cherishes life. It was just this hell that I had to live through. And I hated it. It's kind of why I hate my mom. Because it's still with her. But... ...I want her to know you better. That would be great. We can Skype her this weekend. Okay. Okay. Hey, hurry! Come on, it's on! No, I'm cleaning up. You said you wanted to watch it. It seems stupid. You seem stupid. I... I got to go. What? Um... if it's okay. What do you mean? It's been, uh... I'm pretty tired. Oh. I mean, if it's okay. It's been a long week. Sure. You're all set for the weekend? Yeah. No, Mom. Tilt... Tilt the camera down. We can't really see you. She's okay. Okay. If you turn on a light... Ready? This is a little present for you. Look at this. Aah! Yes. Yes! Hello? Hey. How was the weekend? It was great. You know, I got to see some friends, and... How was yours? It was good. Yeah. It was, um... It felt long. Yeah, it was long. And how have you been feeling? Um, I... I mean, my... It's... It's been acting up a little bit, but it's... It's not... It's not terr... It's not bad. Okay. You hungry? Can I make you some eggs? No, I'm... I'm going to make you some eggs. I want to tell you something right now. Please tell me, what do you got? Since you've driven in here... Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm going to start calling you Estelle. Estelle! Estelle Getty? Listen, it's not... It's not my fault that... Where the fuck did this come from? Fallon. Fallon. That was good point. By the way, I want to thank you, because that wheelchair that she first got me was a hot mess. I was like... I ran over my own toe. I'm just... I'm so bad I just don't even have to look anymore. I'm just turning. I'm just looking at you and I'm not even looking at anything else. What are you doing? I'll just cover it back up... You refuse to look at it. I'm not looking, but I can play piano. Shut up! Eat. It's so pretty. That's all right. Don't eat all the broccoli. You're going to dinner. Oh, my God, that's so good. Good, I'm happy. Yeah. It's too hard. It's no good. You know, um... you were right. About what? I am a better person because of you. I'm never saying that again. So lock it up in the old brain. Doesn't matter. I heard it once. Never going to live it down. You're never going to live that down. Now you just got to bend the knee. Slowly. I'm going to help you. Oh. Oh, my God. You're doing it. Oh, my God. Right? Oh, my God. I'm going to cry! That's incredible. Oh, yeah. I just don't understand. What happened? I just... Ah. I went to the... The sink for some food. And I banged it. I don't know why you insist on walking around when I'm not here. I've asked you not to. I was hungry, and I just needed to get out of the bed. And I'm just... I'm going crazy. Okay, okay, all right. We got to go to the emergency room and get this checked out. No, no, no, no. No, you're in pain. Oh, my God. I need to just... Just... To just wait for the... The pills to kick in, okay? Okay, no, you may have actually reinjured yourself. I would really like for somebody to take a look at this. God, you're like my sister. Wow. I'm not going to the emergency room. Low blow. Your sister? Really? Okay, look, I am sorry. I've just... I've been in this... couch... thing... bed for six weeks. I know, I know. But please, don't take that out on me. Oh, my God, like you were all sunshine and lollipops. No, I was horrible to you. I was horrible to you. I don't know how you put up with it. I want to run screaming from this building right now. You don't even have to worry that I might die. No. God know. This is a total cake walk for me. And I can't even handle this. I was so terrible to you. I was so... I was so angry and I was so scared. And I just... I didn't doubt for one minute that you wouldn't be there for me. And I just... I can't explain. How do you even begin to thank someone for doing that for you? I'm really sorry. It wasn't because I didn't love you. I just didn't want anything to remind me. And I'm sorry. Let's take a look at it. Oh! It's really swollen, isn't it? It's swollen. Hold on. All right. Oh, please, no. I can't. No, no, no. I'm... Shh. I'm texting. I'm going to let her know that I'm going to be late. But are you...? No. Hon, you're in pain. It's the least that I can do. Mm-hmm. Yup. Right there. Goddamn it. This guy, really? Yeah. Really?! He doesn't care. I've... Have you talked to him? Well... Yes. You... You hobbled over there and he hasn't stopped? I hobbled. I dragged. Okay. Okay, I'm going to go talk to him. What do you mean you're going to go... Hey, Devon! Devon! Dev? What? Hey. Hey, man. Can you keep it down? We're trying to sleep. Who is? You know what? If you have a problem, call the police. No, I'm not going to call the police. Come on. Just turn down your music, okay? What are you doing... Oh, my God. Is that Zumba? No, shut up. It's the new cross... I don't have to ex... Okay, you know what? I don't know who you are, but I know you don't live next door. And I know you're not her boyfriend, so back off. No, what are you talking about? Listen, she's in a lot of pain. I'm taking care of her. Turn down your fucking music. Like I said, if you have a problem, call the police. I'm not going to call the police. You're going to turn down your Zumba. Will you step out of my doorway, please? No, I'm going to. Yes, you will! You know what...? Douche bag! You're the douche bag. Guys! Devon. What are you...? You guys, stop it! Stop it, you guys! What are you doing? I don't know. What the hell was that? I don't know. It was like... It was like this... This surge of testosterone. It was primal. I... Oh, my God. It was insane. That's what it was. Oh, my God. It was like this instinct to protect. And then, like... And then he made it seem like he knew you, and not just like as a neighbour. And then I got all like... What? I don't know. Like, jealous. Did you sleep with that guy? No. Okay, okay. All right. I didn't, you know... Oh, my God. Jealous. Yeah, shut up. Jelly bag. Do you hear that? Yeah. What is that I hear? Nothing. Wow. : Ow! : Oh, my God. It's okay. It's... It's okay. I didn't. I'm sorry. That was amazing. Wow. I just can't... I mean, I'm like in the mode now. I can't stop hitting. I just have to bash. And I didn't mean to... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, like, kiss and make it better. Did you kiss it? I did. Oh, I didn't... No, you were in pain. It's okay. Thank you. That's why you're not in pain right now. Such a spaz. Yeah. Sorry. More, please. Ow. No, no, it's okay. Okay, okay. It's so annoying. I only have one hand. I know. I know. You're doing great. Okay. I can't really... I think we have to... No, that's not good. It may be caught. Wait. Just, like... Does it come down? No! That's... Ow, ow, ow. Okay. Shh, shh. So maybe... It's okay. Hold on, but now my hand's stuck. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Be really careful. I will. It's okay, it's okay. I'm shy. I know you are. Good morning. Morning. Are you okay? Are you in pain? No. Oh, no, no, no. I'm good. Good. Um... I need to head home. I should change clothes and get ready for work. Of course, of course. Um, can I make you breakfast? No. Um... Um... You should go home. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So...? Did you sleep with her? Jesus Christ. How is that even possible? Oh. That's how hot you were for her. Only, um, two working limbs, I think it was. And she kind of smelled. When I was there she kind of smelled. That's me... But you had to have her. If we could just stay calm about this. No! I get it. You... You were sharing. She was sharing something. Some... Some deep whatever. I'm so sorry I'm not sick and vulnerable, so you can feel so profoundly about me too. Jodi, stop it. I can get sick if you want. Would you like me to get sick, baby? Hmm? Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. One sec. Oh! I'm just going to get food poisoning. Jodi, come on. No, no, no. Jodi. Okay, shh, shh, shh. Give me. Okay. Oh... I tried to get closer to you, but you wouldn't let me. I know, I know, I know. Excuse me. Jodi, no. Jodi. Jodi... Hello? Fall? Hello. Hi. Yeah. That's right, it's me. Oh, you didn't think I'd do this, did you? I could slap your face right now, and you couldn't do anything about it. What are you...? What are you...? Stop it! What are you...? Cut... What are you...? Stop! Where's Devon? Did you kill him or something? I was nice to you! Stop! Oh! I brought you cupcakes. Oh! Devon owes you? Does he owe you? Don't you owe me something? Like, for instance, the courtesy not to try and steal my boyfriend away from me? Don't you at least owe me that? Hello? Uh... Hey, I'm just checking in. See if you need anything. Hey. Yeah, it's no big deal. I am not going to beat her up. I said what I had to say. You have done something bad to me, and I will always hate you. That's very extreme. Um... I will never think anything nice about you, ever. Just know there's a person in this world who thinks you're horrible. Okay, it's time to go, yeah? Well, I'm sorry, who are you? Who is this? Who are you? Someone else she's sleeping with? Jesus Christ. Oh, for a crippled person, you really get around. Okay... Whoa! Stay! Hey, hey. Look... All right. It's time for you to go. You just... Okay. Jodi? Just... Hey, hey, hey! Whoa! Okay! Devon! Devon! Aah! You see? This is why I don't... Because I wasn't even... Bye now. Thank you! Whatever! Okay. Okay, let's go. No. It's fine. It's fine now. I just had to say something to her. Just, I... Okay, I'll wait outside. You guys can talk, say how crazy I am. Oh, by the way, um, it's hard to work on my jealousy issues when you're cheating on me. Um... I'm sorry. I didn't know that she's... No, no. Hey, she's right. Devon, she's right. This was wrong. You're right. What can I do? Nothing. We're good. What does that mean? We're good. Really? Yeah. Consider the debt paid in full. Okay. Dev... You took really good care of me. Thanks. ...Jumped out of the back of a black Lincoln Town Car. A car service? Maybe. But we got no plate number. Do we at least have a name on the victim? You're going to love this: Crystal. Is that the first name or last name? So you're not going to see him again, after all that? I don't think so. And he hasn't called? No. And it's been two weeks? Yes. And you have no idea if he's still with her or... No. And that doesn't piss you off? No. No, no, no. You guys, you're not going to get me to be mad at him. There's nothing to be mad about. I'm fine. But don't you miss him? I mean... Yes, I do. But it's... Can you people shut up? Clearly she's in a really good place right now. And this is gross. Can we move into the kitchen? Like, y'all going to get lint all up in the asparagus. You know what? I'm going to zest your little head. This piece is going to go... Look at you. You're going to be in Louboutins in no time, girl.

After what I did for you? Didn't I scrub your floors for you? I didn't make you do that. Yes. What do I have to do? Um... I'm going to have to scrub your floors? I'll see you later. I thought we were going to go to... Hi. Hi. What's up? Look at you. I know! So excited! So... how did you...? Oh, I called Fallon. Yeah. I knew it was the big day coming up, so I wanted to...
