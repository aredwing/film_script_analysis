He had broken the most depruted taboo and found not guilt, not anxiety or fear, but freedom Every humiliation which stood in his way could be swept aside by this simple act of annihilation: Murder Thanks, John.

The girl was killed with a razor and your books in mout Ah. We found this on the floor of your appart- ment here. It's for you! There was only one answer to the fury that tortured him.

Uhm... - Thank you! Hi I am Maria. Oh Hi! - You had a deeper voice on the phone! That was my father. Is it ok to go into the bathroom? Oh, I don't think it's over there! No, no it's around there, that's fine. Ah, there it is. - Mhhh. I guess the switch must be in the kitchen! - Oh! Oh you wrote Out of Dawn? It was terrific. You read it, hu? Oh, it was good. Look right here. Oh yes, I see! Mhh. The bookstore at the corner has a window. Just your books are in it! Really? You should go in. Carlo would love to say hello! That sounds very nice. Maybe I will some day. Good Morning! - Good Morning You don't waste time, do you? That was jelda my dear. She She was fixing my water! Your personal plumber! I guess I've to wait 2 hours before the water is hot! Do you know what time I woke up this morning? No, what time did you wake up? 5 a.m.? Oh you poor thing. Are your pillows too hard? I'll get you a feather pillow! The pillows are too hard! I'll get you feather pillow. I meant to. Forgot! Sorry. It is near the elevator! Ok, thanx! Today I need the typewriter! It's ordered! Good! When did this come. It wasn't here a minute ago. When? - Just now! "Sic transit Gloria lesbie!" So passes glory of Lesbos What does that mean! It means our killer had most likely studied latin! I don't know, maybe he's he's killed again!? A cut of 14cm diagonal going to the clavicle! Hi Doc. It's always nice to see you. But I like this place less and less. It's cold too. Warmer, and you complain about the smell! How far have we got? It was the same razor than the opening examination on the girl killed 6 weeks ago! The blade has 3 shattered nixoning. Wanna see? No! The girl had intercourse less than 1 hour before she was killed. There was an A negative secretion. Well it doesn't mean the killer was the lover! No, but they often are. Dofbar correctable with courier 72 at your service. Lovely! Where shall I put it? Over there - Hello? Capatain Germani! Yes, Captain? Who's been killed? Hello Mr. Bulmer, would you like a drink? No, thank you. You two go right ahead. I am fine! Thank you, Angelica. Can we sit down? Oh yes, thanx. I'd like to do about half an hour with you... now? Oh no, in the studio as part of the early transmission. I'd like to do something in depth. They let me do it about twice a year. Ok fine! Now, Tenebrae is about human possession and it's effects on society! And I'd like to know how you see it effects the behaviour on our lives? Well first of all it isn't just about that. No... - The killer is... Wait a minute, wait a minute One was gay, so what. I mean his portraits is perfectly happy... The motivation is to el- iminate corruption The killer is insane! What I mean by that is that the only aberrant behaviour... Ahh - what is aberrant behaviour? I was brought up a very strict catholic. Were you? Yeah! - But I believe in ab- ortion, I believe in divorce That makes me aberrant from a strict catholic standpoint I see. I thought this was an afternoon show! You really want us to get this heavy? Well, I guess not. It's just that I'm getting really interessted myself. Well, I really appreciate it That's a real compliment! We're starting in 4 minutes, Christiano. Ok, mh... shall we? It's down here! Hey, hey my hat! I am going to start the show with a resume of your work! They're just starting. It'll Ok. We go ahead... You see, Peter is a really sensitive guy & an interview is a delicate thing. I don't want him disturbed. Isn't that Yes Montand there Yeah, thats him. Anyways, is there anything I can do for you? Peter has go one hell of a schedule & he starts work on his new book! What's your relation? I'm his agent! You get 10% of his conver- sation with police aswell? Careful now, I have feelings like a real human beeing. Somehow other than your client holds the key! Those Killings are like, like a tribute to Peter Neal What'd you do with 10% of a tribute like that? You know something. I read em all, Agatha Christie Mickey Spillane, McBain and I'm a detective right! And you never guess who the murderer is! - Right never. You just remember, any bright ideas, you let me know, ok? You write these things but I turn over real dead bodies! Good bye, Capatain! Well how did it go, ok? Yes it's really. I got his autogrpah! -Whose? Eve Montant! - So what? Could it be somebody I know? Damn. I wish I'd never written that book! You don't mean that! Hi! - Hi! Mr. Bulmer left this down- stairs for you. Wait, I go down with you! Is that a proposal? If you like! Ok, if you need me, I'll be at home! -Go ahead! Jane? Is that Jane? Janne McKerrow? - I could have sworn it was! What's the prefix to New York? But, it's impossible - she is in New York - She never strays 10 miles from her shrink - Here! Jane McKerrow. I am out for the moment. Would you leave your name, number and message after the tone? It was Jane! But she'd call you. If only to scream at you! She wouldn't even be here if it wasn't to try to get you back or apologize. Apologize for what? For what she did to, oh god forget it... My Travel Bag. You think it was Jane? I never said it was I am going home, no more puzzles! Anne, do you think Jane could have done that? Bye - Bye, See you later! No. I told you I don't give a damn! You understand? Why don't you say something? Go fuck yourself! Bastard! Help Me. Is anybody home? Hello there!? Is anybody here? Help me. Isn't anybody here? Please. Oh god, please help me. The door was open and I was attacked by a dog! Spy! Damn litte Spy. No. Leave me alone. What do you want from me? "I grieve for this child." Her death was the only way "to be free to go on!" "I will eliminate those who" "disgust me." The human" perverts soon now the "corruptor himself." Me. Be careful. This killer is also very well informed. He knew you're here! Knows you've an agent here where h can send the letter. And he also knows it's be dangerous to come around to your place coz the girl, I mean Maria, was living in your building! You need me anymore today, Captain? No, No Mr. Neal... But I'd like you to stay in your appartement if possible because this last message threatens you personally. By the way I finished your book. You know what? I knew on Page 30 who the killer was. For the 1st time Oh. I can't do this! Going through your address- book, trying to pick out crazy people it's crazy! Why me, why - because, coz I have corrupted, he says! Or she says! She right! Trying to eliminate the human perverts. Christiano Berti the TV critic called "Tenebrae" a novel about" appartent behaviour and human perversion. He was very weird about it. Hey Gianni, gimme that telephone book. Christiano Berti lives only three blocks from here! Now wait a minute. This is paranoia! Maria's body was found there Tenebrae is a novel about human perversion and it's effect on society. Those were his exact words before we did the interview. Trying to eleminate the human perverts. Two words, that's hardly a case against him! You could mention it to the captain! - No, No way. "Famous writer has funny" "idea?" They would love tha "Peter Neal plays the fool" "to raid the killer"." On the other hand, if Peter Neal got it right, wouldn't that be something? The cops are all over the place. Mhh 10:15, they should be quitting soon! The victim was 17 year old Maria Alboreto. What happened there this morning is still a mystery. Meanwhile we understand our murderer sent another letter to the police in his magesty warns he'll be striking ag.! He says the next victim will be someone he refers to "The Great Corrupter"." Well as a matter of fact this is expected to result i several businessmen and pol- iticians leaving the city! Jane? - Jane! This is Jane McKerrow. I am out for the moment. Leave... Come on! I haven't been in a garden since I was 6 Shut up! This is boring. All detecive work is boring. But if you cut... ...out the boring bits and keep the rest... ...you've got a bestseller! Jesus - He must have been there all the time! He couldn't have seen us! Listen, I go to the back! Peter! Who is it? Who's there? Yes it was me! Peter, Peter! Come on Hurry! Oh... my head! We've gotta get out of here. The Guy has an axe! He must still be in the house. We've gotta go, come on. What happened to you. I don't know. Somebody must've hit me! What did you see, the killer? I couldn't see much. I don't remember! Was he tall, short? What? I don't know. I didn't see anything except the axe! The Killer. Christiano knew the killer. Said it was him He said he was who killed them all. That many murdered. The blood! You've to tell the police What you saw could break it. I didn't see shit. A dead man and his head split open. You know what I saw? My mother putting me in the schoolbus in Rhode Island. That's what I saw. After the knock on the head. Like in the movies You should've a doctor look at this! No, it's ok. Just a little dizzy and very done! Peter, maybe we should, maybe we should both go back to New York. Anne, would you sleep here tonight? Just company. I will make up the bed. Of course I'll stay! Six years, and we've never spent one night together! Four of those six years we had Jane around to disaprove Oh. How does your head feel? My Head? How my head feels? Well that is an interessting question. My head? What head, hm? Peter, in the morning we both forget about this, ok? Nothing's happend, Nothing! Nothing's happened! Peter? Peter? Thanx. Would you like some coffee, Mr. Neal? Well close the deal on that basis-No thank you-come in. I am just broken up over Christiano. Unbelievable. Listen I only came to say well I'm thinking of leaving Rome for a couple of weeks. Maybe going to Paris or some other place! Peter, Peter, you can't let me down now. We are within two days of making a deal! Please, stay until friday! My Life is in danger. There's no deal in world worth risking my life for! You are right! You are right! You know what. I'll book a suite for you over the hills Tell people you are going back to New York just lay lo until the publishers and financers come back. And it's a million dollar deal, you understand? Just you & me'll know where you are. It's safe! Do that for me, will you? What is it? Sir Donald Otley on line 1! Where is he? - In London! Put him on hold! What do you say? - I'll call you this afternoon! Donald, how are you? Hello, hello? Where is that damn drunk? He said he'd call back. No Calls! It's alright Darling! I feel so filthy. Hearing his voice from the other side of the door wondering if he knows about us! No, no it won't be long, I promise you! Jane? Will I see you for lunch today? Yeah. Same place? Piazza Arduini - 1 o'clock! I can't go in that house No way! You don't have to, Gianni! Just stay in the car! The lights went out. Somebody switched them off. Not Christiano. I heard him screaming! Stop right here! I'll walk, you drive and I'll see you later! - Ok! I called you over here coz I didn't want to come to you til we finished doing a complete checkup. Was it the same killer? I think so. Only this time it was done with an axe! You didn't get the yellow envelope yet? Oh No! - You will! You said that you only met With Mr. Berti twice, aeh?? Yes, at an airport press conference and the TV interview. Look here. Peter Neal... Analysis of Obsesssion Peter Neal, Aparrent Behavior - The Novel Peter Neal, Personal Born Rhode I. Pref School in Yale. Strict Catholic. Taller than I expected with lightbrown eyes. He looked at me often but he never spoke to me. Jesus. Somebody was really into your life! Can we go outside? - Sure! Bless you! Oh thank you. I have an allergy to dust What happened to your head? Just feeding my brains out on the case. One thing's for sure. The killer and Christiano Berti were both obsessed by your work! Last time we talked, I think I was a little sarcastic but you know we need all the help we can get. Well I was trying to build the plot the same way you're trying to figure it out but I just have that hunch that something is missing. Tiny piece of jigsaw. Some- body who should be dead is alive, or somebody who should be alive is... already dead. Explain that. You know there is a sentence in a Conan Doyle Book When you have eliminated the imp., whatever remains however inprobable must be the truth! Hound of the Baskervilles? Yes. You know the impossible in this case is that the chain of killings doesn't make sense! In Hound of the Baskervilles the impossible was a giant ghost dog! The improbable in this case again, like the book is almost certainly weird, unbelievable but possible. That's what we have to find. Truth is always possible! Mr. Neal! - I have to go. I'm a very devoted reader, Mr. Neal and I'd like to think that 20 more books of yours to enjoy in future! So I guess what I'm asking is selfish. Tell me, would you leave town? Today? I was going to do just that. Ah ok, let me know where to find you, eh? Good luck! For you, Jane. Passport? - Passport. Passport. Oh Passport. OK. The bank's wired me the money at Raphael in Paris. You are booked for a week. Good. Hello? The Captain? I am afraid he is out to the airport already. Yes? Is there anything I can... Alright! Good bye! He just wanted to make sure you're going. Something happened he said he was only checking to make sure you were safe! Oh, hi! Hi! Ann brings me to the Airport You don't have to drive me! I know there is a piece of the puzzle back at the house If I remember it, see it. Where are you going? Classified! Silly, I know but if no one knows... That's cool. But I'd be glad to see you again! I'm really that you had to get caught up in all this! I won't say it's worth it, but I'm glad we've met! And call me when it's over and you'll be back in Rome! I go down with you! - OK! Yes I killed them. It was me! I killed them, I killed them all! Christiano... But I don't... Killed them all, killed them all... Christiano is the murderer. So who killed him? Hello? Oh Ann, I'm sorry I wanted Peter! He's gone, he's left Italy. I did something so... It's like there are two people in me... ...and sometimes the other one just takes over! Where are you, Jane? Are you in Rome? Yeah. Help me please, don't let me kill myself. Tell me where you are Jane. I'll come around, alright. An appartment, on the Cassia No. 11. I'll be right down. Give me a few minutes! I am so sorry! I didn't mean to. I wanted to explain... ...about... ...everything... ...I have done! Ok, I'm coming. God damn. Who is that lady? She is the housekeeper of Bulmer. She's a Philipino and has a lot of interesting stuff to say say about him. Like Bulmer had a girlfriend A regular grilfriend. What language she speaks? Only Tagalog and Spanish! You question her! The Murderer has killed again I have to go! Ok, I see you later, eh!? Have you got a license to work for Mr. Bulmer? Oh, thank you! Good bye! Ann? Is it you Ann? Ann? I didn't know... I didn't know that... No, don't look! When you have eliminated the impossible, whatevery remains, however improbably must be the truth. And Bulmers maid told Insp. Altieri he had an affair... ...with your fiance Altieri was too headstrong and came over here... ...alone to check. She didn't know that you Neal are mad. Completely mad. And it cost her her life. I don't know if I should hate or feel sorry for you! No, I didn't kill the other women, I didn't kill them! I know. That would have been impossible! But I realized Christiano Berti was the killer. And it didn't take me long to realize that. The rest, Mr. Germani, was like writing a book. A Book! Perfect revenge. The Razor Killer was dead... . but you wanted him to live on... ...long enough to be blamed for the murder of your... . fiance & her lover. The two people you hated most! Come on, get up! - No! Turn around. You know the routine. Come on, get up. Get up! - Come on, move over there. I'll call from the car radio Come on now, lets go. No wait. I don't want to leave him! Lets go now! Ok, it's over! Peter! It's not possible. I couldn't believe it either not until I got the telex from Interpol this evening. When Peter was a teenager in Rhode Island, a girl he knew was killed, brutally! Someone accused him but there wasn't any evidence and it was never brought to trial! But it was Peter Neal. There he committed an act which haunted his life and twisted his mind forever! It was in his last book. Now he realized that any obstactle or humilitation standing in his way could be swept aside by a simple act of annihilation: Murder! Calm down, it's all over now You better stay here. Wait for me
