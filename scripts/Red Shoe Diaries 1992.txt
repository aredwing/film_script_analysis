He restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of|righteousness for his namesake. Yea though I walk through the valley|of the shadow of death I will fear no evil, for you|are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. Your miracles will be performed in|the presence of my enemies, you anoint my head with oil.|My cup runs over. I'm sorry, Jack.|It's terrible. All the day of my life, I was well|in the house of the lord. I'm so sorry, Jake. I'm really sorry about Alex.|We'll all miss her. When you work up the courage|to talk about this, you know where to find me. Got it all cleaned up, Mr. Jack. I'm sorry.|I couldn't take the cemetery. I don't understand. She was so... She was so much to live for. Hi, we're not in right now.|Work, work, work. Leave us a message. Jake? It's Marlene. So, could i take you out to dinner tonight?|And maybe just talk. I just don't think you should be alone. So, call me, alright?|Okay, bye. Friday, July 12. Too excited.|Too much energy, took off from work early, and danced, and danced. And danced. Six months and he's already a part|of my every breath, my every thought. He's everything|i ever dreamed of. A fairy tale Prince. If an hour|goes by without hearing his voice, i'm lost. Adrift.|I've surrendered to his taste, to his place, to his every wish. He knows me inside out,|everything about me. My troubles with my mother, the|abortion i had when i was eighteen, my fear of the dark,|my fascination with fire. No, Jack. There's people there.|No, Jake, the wedding. I don't care.|- No. Yes. No... okay... Maybe. I've given him every memory of the past, every dream of the future. I've thrown all my card on|the table before him. I'm an open book. I want my mystery back.|Something. Anything. One thought, one deed, one tiny|secret that's mine alone. I don't understand. Look at this, Paul.|When the sun rises, it's gonna hit the buildings|and create shadows down on the ground, for the people on the parks|down on the street. It's gorgeus. - Who gives a shit|how the light hits down there? Nobody see it this way. Helicopter|pilots, maybe. - And angels. Jesus Christ, Jake, not that|angel bullshit again. No, look, just unclench.|Enjoy the sunset. Think about how the angels are|gonna love this sunset. Look. July 15th. Another 14-hour day. We are both equally compulsive.|Equally dedicated to our work. The difference is i change the look|of people's living rooms, the fabric of the couches.|- Bye, cutie! Jake changes the skyline. His buildings will affect the way|people live for the next 100 years. Not much of a comparison when|you really think about it. Do you know how lucky you are to|enjoy your work as much as you do? And to be as good as you are.|And to be rewarded for it? I envy that. I really do. I've always had this thought that maybe God put certain people|on this earth to take care of us. Doctors, poets, musicians. People with vision. People like you. Come here. Just stand right here. Take off your sweater.|- Why? I wanna see the outline of your body|through your nightgown. I love the way look. I love the way you smell. I love the way you taste. I love the way you feel. I love the way you smile. I love the way you scratch me. I love the way you moan. I love the way you come. I love everything.|I love it. Don't say that.|- I love you. O... T... A... L... Z... F?|- No, don't move. August 8th.|Got my eyes checked today. Try not to blink. You've got something|imbedded in your iris. Looks like a little chunk of glass. Have you felt any irritation?|No, please. It'd be better for both of us|if you didn't move. If this ruptured, it could cause you|serious trouble. I read that 70 to 80% of all|the people in the world give up, stop growing, stop dreaming, and settle down the time|they are twenty-two, become an eye-doctor and make|your mother happy, nice and safe. Don't move a muscle. I could barely walk straight.|No perspective. I should have called Jake, but i sort of enjoy the adventure. I hope you hit that|son of a bitch back! Amazing. Every passing stranger|assumed I was a victim. That I had been beaten by my man. Don't let'em get away with it.|Get the hell out. You okay? Crazy drivers. You get something in you eye?|- A piece of glass. It happens. Accidents. You put in all this time and energy|planning for your future, and bam! A car runs you down|on the street or bullet hits you by mistake. That sucks.|- Yeah, that sucks. Nothing would piss me off more than that.|I think about it a lot. Goodbye dreams. Lights go out.|- That's all she wrote. You just never know,|know what I mean. I know what you mean. It was just a piece of glass. Take it easy. Perfect teeth, perfect skin, perfect chest, perfect hair, I just fell into his arms. The wind just sort of blew me his way. Perfect. August 12th. Got the bandages|taken off my eye today. Just happened to end up on|the same corner. A little childish, a little|narcissistic maybe. The perfect boy, the perfect ploy, the perfect contender in a battle|that's already been won. Someone so different from Jake,|there's no contest, no conflict, no competition, no confusion. The perfect secret. Lady's Shoe Outlet I know you, don't I?|- I don't think so. You looking for shoes?|- I'm always looking for shoes. Come on in. Have a look. I got something just for you. Have a seat. Aren't you gonna ask me my size?|- Seven and a half B. Yep. Seven and a half B.|Batia La Page. La Page.|- Who is she? A woman in France. Did you buy there?|- Yes. How much?|- I don't remember. Come on, how much? About two hundred dollars.|- Two hundred dollars? These are American.|Kenneth Cole, my main man. And they are much prettier. Stand up, walk around, let me|see what they look like. Beautiful. They make you look like a Princess. You like them?|- Yes. You know, I'm glad to see you|got that bandage off your eye. Can you see better?|- Obviously not well enough. I didn't recognize you in this store.|- I work two jobs. I see. You know when the weather main broke|the other day? - It was funny. It felt good, didn't it?|You like the way this feels? Being close like this.|Answer me. Yes. There's no rational explanation for|the attraction between two people. It just sort of happens,|like accidents. It has to do with magic. Magic.|- Alchemy. Chemistry. Electromagnetic vibratory|transmission forces. The stuff that moved the blocks|for the pyramids. Right now, I could balance one of those blocks|on the front of my pants. Really?|- Yeah, have a look. See what you see. Ladies, I'll be right with you. Six double A, nine B. Am I right?|- Amazing. So... Will this be cash or credit card?|- Credit card. That is where I live.|Meet me tomorrow night. Eight o'clock. Thank you. Step on a crack and break|your mother's back. When I was a kid I dared myself|to do the most outrageous things. I'd get right up to the edge,|and inevitably... inevitably, i'd find an|excuse to tail out. How many hours a day do you|spend in this thing? Never enough.|I lie back. Close my eyes. I feel|nothing but warm darkness. And I float up, up. Free. You're one of those|Victorian mystery boxes. You open one and there's another. And you open that one and|there's another inside that. Just when you think|you've opened the last box, there's another, always another. Always. Jake?|- Yeah, baby, what? Let's take tomorrow off. Let's take a long ride|out to Santa Barbara, stay in some|seedy motel. I can't.|- Why not? I've got to duke it out with Paul|and the big boys over dinner. Do it another night.|- I can't baby. Please. I can't. When the light's just|right like this, it's as if the ship is|actually out on the sea, somwhere in Mediterranean... I can see the passengers, men in their tuxedos and|the women in their gowns. That on there is drunk. You see, see the woman over|there in the feather boa? In the purple hat?|- Yeah, screaming at the captain. Yeah|- It's my mother. He just threw her off.|- As to be so lucky.++++ Come on, sweetheart, talk to me. Stop me from going. Filled with fire,|burning with shame, I kept telling myself|over and over that I'd never go through with it.|No way.. Are you going to a party, Mrs. Alex? A meeting.|- You look gorgeous. Of course you always look gourgeous.|- Thank you. Are you okay? My world was falling apart|with each step, but that didn't stop me. I had to see Jake. I was sure that|he'd rush up to me, hold me, stop me. 24 hours! If the shipment is not here...|- He didn't even see me. I will see your ass in court.|- Will you excuse us for a minute? Be careful, Jake. This guy can|kill us, he will kill us. If you show any weakness they'll|eat you for breakfast. Trust me.|I know what I doing. Okay? Mitch, don't you dare fucking|stonewall me, okay? I'm sick of your excuses|and I'm tired of you. To know what you want and|to go after it and get it, and to actually belive you deserve it, my God, how envy Jake for that. I told myself for|the hundreth time: Run! I don't know what I'm doing here. I told you I could move stone blocks|with my cock. Your curiosity was piqued.|Now here you are. Why don't you take off your clothes? I...|- What? I just suddenly realize|I don't know you. I don't even know your name. You're no stranger to me. I know everything I need to know. You don't know anything about me.|- Sure I do. I know you're beautiful. You wear two hundreatd dollar shoes, and you are with someone who|doesn't make you happy. But he does. He makes me too happy,|that's the problem. Seriously. Have you ever noticed how liars|start each sentence with: "To tell the truth"? You keep saying "No, seriously". It makes me think that you're|just fooling around. Are You? No. Then, seriously, why don't you|take off your dress. and walk over here in|your pretty new shoes? Only a girl with a Gold Card would|leave her dress on the floor. Unbuckle my belt. This started with|me on the my knees. Now it's your turn. Fuck you. My panties, rip them off. Do it. He made love like he|worked on the street. Tender as a jackhammer. Tender as a jackhammer. Jesus. August 20th I told my self over and over, once could be rationalized|as a foolish mistake, temporary insanity,|an act of passion. Twice was irreversible. Who is it? I like that. The minute i saw him, I understood what I wanted. Something I've never had in my life. Something I've always gladly|given up to others. The greatest aphrodisiac of all: control. Hi, we're not in right now.|Work, work, work. Leave us a message. I haven't seen him in two weeks.|He's out of my life like an alcoholic coming off the hooch. One minute, one hour,|one day at the time. And I'll never see him again. This kind of calamander|is more expensive, of course, but it's hundred percent silk.|- Excuse me just a moment. I'm sorry to bother you, there's a|guy who says he's your brother. I'm gonna send you two off|with Michelle. She's gonna show you the other|colours and patterns. Just give me fifteen minutes and we'll|finish everything off. Okay? Right this way please.|- Thanks, Michelle. See what'd tell you?|- What a surprise. I told her I was your brother.|I don't think she belived me. How did you find me? It wasn't hard.|I let my fingers do the walking. I hate your suit. Funny, I thought it|looked good on me. Belonged to my father.|He wore it everyday of his life. Said it brought him luck. Why are you here? I wanted you. I want you all the time now. I don't even know your name.|That's the way I want to keep it. My name is Tom. That's short for|Thomas K. Butler. I don't wanna hear it.|- Same name as my dad. Please. Everybody used to call me Junior. After my dad died, my mother started calling|me Tom for the first time in my life. I didn't even know who|she was talking to. I had to drop out of school to|help support my brothers. Gave up football scholarship|to the University of Illinois. What the hell, right? You gotta do what you gotta do. I'm sorry you|don't like my suit. Pick out another one for me and|I'll go down and buy it. You can pick up my underwear,|my shirts, anything you want.|And I'll wear them. You know why? Because you're the one of|the only really nice things that's ever happened to me. When I'm with you I feel like|I just stepped out of the shower. I feel clean.|Please, look at me. What I'm saying is important. If you don't come to me,|I'm gonna come to you. I'll find out where you live,|I'll camp out on your doorstep. Think your boyfriend will believe|that I'm your brother? I'll see you around. Now he has a name. No place to run.|No place to hide. Trapped. October 21st|my 26th birthday. Now remember, keep a happy face. Shall I make a wish?|- Wish first. Concentrate. I don't wanna kiss you,|I wanna make a toast to lovely, gorgeous, stunning, radiant Alex, whose perfect life I think|matches her perfect beauty and Alex and I've been friends for... How long?|Tell the truth. No, since... Wait.|Since we were seventeen. Seventeen?|Please say you're seventeen. Are you okay? Yes. I might be coming down|with a flu or something. That's what I told your brother when|you didn't show up for work today. My brother?|- He called. He was worried about you. I said you hadn't been feeling well|and you were at home resting. You didn't tell him where I live,|did you? He asked for your telephone number. He's your brother, for Christsake's,|I gave it to him. Hey.|- Okay. Come on, please. Have a good time.|- I'm fine. It's your birthday.|We love you. How does anyone know what|anyone else is feeling? How can I turn to?|Who can I talk to? I hate shrinks. If I told my friends that my problem|was not one man, but two, they'd kick me in the head. Maybe I should run an ad in the paper: "Woman out of control seeks clues|to own dark pain and passion. from other women's experiences.|Willing to pay top dollar Send diaries to|Red shoes, P.O. BOX... Whatever". Come back. Here it comes.|- Did it break? - Not yet. He's a tough little bastard. A candy?|- Beautiful, isn't it? No, no. Unwrap that first. What's that?|- Atmosphere? What's that?|- You'll see. Come on over here. Come on.|- Where are we going? Just come with me. Sit. What's this?|- I want to do this right Okay?|- Okay, go ahead. It is... A velvet box. Marry me, Alex. Is that a yes or a no? I think I had too much to|drink this afternoon. You wanna talk about it? Jake, I know you think you|know everything about me, but there's so much you don't know. Like what?|- Like... When I was a kid I was so screwed up|I listened to myself breathe at night because I thought if I didn't I|wouldn't wake up in the morning. I used to bang my head against|the wall untill it hurt. It was like I just|couldn't stop myself. I just|couldn't stop myself. All kids feel like that|from time to time. No. I'm talking dark. So dark it scared the shit|out of my parents. Who? Not your mother. She took me to all types of|doctors 'cause she... She thought it was my thyroid,|but it wasn't my thyroid, Jake. And it just got worse and|she got really scared. She got so scared because, it's the only thing|she couldn't control. I can remember writing this elaborate|will when I was eleven. And then when I didn't die, I wrote|another one when I was fifteen. I was so fucked up.|- Those days are over, baby. Fuck it! I can't even drive a car. I'm the only person in Los Angeles|who can't drive a car. Any idiot can drive a car, baby. It takes a genius to get her|friends to drive her everywhere. Stop. I don't want to. That's the thing about life. If you look at thing hard enough, long enough, in the harsh|light of the day, you'll eventually see the flaws. That's why everything I make|I design with lots of shadows. The shadows make things beautiful. Special. Your shadows make|you beautiful, Alex, I love you. I want you to marry me. It was like I was Standing|outside myself, watching pieces of a puzzle|fall into place. The whole picture of my life, all the patterns that keep repeating. All the same rotten mistakes. Why when I have a good thing going,|do I always checkmate myself? What's the matter with you, Rita? Your boyfriend keeping you up nights?|You look like shit! And one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and eight. All right, ladies,|that'll be all for today. So tell me. What's his name?|- Jake, mother. - Jake. Exactly what kind of|an architect are you? Hope not one of those conceptual|assholes spending his life therifing the utopian environment. Jake designs skyscrapers.|- Design and build are different things. He builds them to. I despise intimidating men.|- Jake's not intimidating. Is that so? He bamboozled you,|otherwise you wouldn't defend him. I don't know what she told you, but|her father was a real cocksucker. You're not one of those passive|aggressive types, are you? No, I'm just aggressive. And intimidating.|Are you a good lover? Oh god.|- Are you attentive! Patient? Unselfish?|Do you take your time? Shut the door and|you'll find out. Hey, wait a minute! Fuck your mother.|She can piss on my head. I don't care. It doesn't change|what I feel about you. You've said enough about|my fucking mother. Fuck you. Look at me.|What are you afraid of? What? Don't run away.|What are you afraid of? Hi, we're not in right now.|Work, work,work. Leave us a message. I... If you're there, this is me. What's going on?|Your office is closed and I... I miss you. Can't let him intimidate me.|Can't let him frighten me. Got to tell him face to face. If I can't do that, if I can't sit|in a room across from him, and tell him that it's over,|then I'm not worth shit. Not worth a shit. I'm looking for Tom Butler.|- Yeah. What for? A letter.|- Right here. Sign right here for me.|- All right. Here you go. - All yours.|- Thanks a lot. Hey, nice boots.|- Thanks. How you doing? Where's the shoes? Worn out. It's all that running away|you've been doing. I stopped by your office three|times this week. Where were you? I had flu. And you're better now?|Is that what we are celebrating? I'm getting married. I won't be seeing you anymore. Is this a game?|Are you playing with me? I know you have my home number.|Please don't use it. Ever. Say: "Please don't use it Tom."|- It's over between us. It ain't over 'till it's over.|That's just the way it is. I came here to see you.|To feel you. To make love to you. There's no way that I'm gonna|leave here until I do. Not a chance. It ain't over 'till it's over. Make a move.|I'll move faster. Touch me again|and i'll scream. Scream then. Get it over with. Get it over with. I'll have your clothes ripped off. I'll be inside you before they|break down the door. It ain't over 'till it's over. I'll be like one of those dogs|you see in the park. They'll have to turn a firehouse|on me to get me off you. Please don't talk that way. Why? Does it excite you? It make me sick.|- Puke then. But please,|don't leave me. It's tragic, isn't it? I thought that if you didn't know me,|you couldn't control me. Now here I am again. I'm an open book. I want you to let me go, Tom. Say my name again.|I love it when you say my name. Things have a life and that life|comes to an end. Sit down. I won't move|if you don't want me to. I just want to feel you here. No, not like that. Like this. Can you feel how much I want you?|- Yes. Does it feel good?|Do you feel the way it feels? Yes. Do you thing that's something|with no life left in it? Do you think I can|just walk out that door? When I come I'm only gonna|wanna come again. That's the way it is.|It ain't over 'till it's over. I'm gonna kiss you goodbye tonight, then I'm gonna kiss you hello again|next week. Yes, yes, yes. Yes.|- It feels good, doesn't it? From now on, Wednesdays are mine. You're out of control. Hey, you don't answer|my phone calls! If you don't come to the door at|least come to the windows. I need to know what your plans are. I need to know if you'll ever|come back to work. Look, what happened to you is|horrible. Nobody can deny that. But a lot of people put a lot of|money and a lot of faith in us, and when they ask questions,|they deserve answers. I'll cover you. Just|give me a date, a time. A week, a month. Six months,|whatever. I just need to know. Jake, don't be an asshole. Damn! Hey, where'd you come from? What can I do for you? I'm looking for something for|a friend. Very high, very sexy. Maybe red.|- Yeah. What size? Seven, seven and a half.|- Okay, I'll see what I got for you. Everything but red. Blue. Pink. And I have green. I had my heart set on red. It's too bad.|It's a popular colour. Hey, there. What's your name?|What do they call you? Stella. Stella. You know who said that? Stanley Kowalski,|"Streetcar named desire". Yap? Tried out for the role in school,|they gave it to one kid with pimples. That's too bad. Red shoes with high heels?|I hear that. Playoffs. Must be the end|of the half. I love basketball. Thirteen triple E. Nine wide|in eleven and a half double E. Am I right? - Yes, right.|- Alright. What's up, man? Are you following me?|- Hey, the shoe salesman. How you doing?|- Alright. How you doing? A beer? I'd love one. - Reese, two beers.|- Okay, two beers. I'll pay for that.|- That's alright. Beer, man. Thank you.|- My one and only love. Yes! NCAA action, you can't beat it. Basketball, beer,|an occasional woman or two. In a perfect world I'd be black,|6,9 feet and they'd call me Mike. Some of the guys I played against|in the pick up games around here are as good as the ones up there,|they took a wrong turn. Really?|- You know what I mean? - I do. How much money you got on you?|- How much I got on me? Why, do you need some money? I bet you a thousand dollars against|whatever you have in your pocket that I can beat you in a game|of twenty one. What? I bet you a grand against whatever|you have in your pocket that I can spot you ten points|and still kick your ass. What, are you kidding me?|- Don't I look like a ballplayer to you? No.|- Really? Not everybody looks|like who they are. I'd never have thought you were a|guy that sells ladies shoes. It's a just a part-time job. I know. When I was a kid, my|mother used to take me shopping, the guys selling shoes were dignified|with greying hair at the temples, drink Martinis at lunch, kind of guys who would have been|gigolos in Miami beach if they could go there. That's my idea of shoe salesman. But you really never know who|somebody is until you test them. You never realy know?|- You don't know. A grand against whatever|you have in your pocket says I am who I pretend to be and|I can kick your ass on the court. What do you say, Michael?|You ready to be tested? What have you got to lose. I've called dozens of times,|left dozens of messages. I never got a chance...|- Marlene... - Hi. I'm just having a beer.|- I'm sorry. We'll talk about it later. My friend Ingrid, and this is|Ingrid's friend, Heidi and Heidi's friend, Heidi.|- Heidi again. And this is Jake and...|who's your friend? - Tom. Thomas K. Butler Jr.|- Hi. Tom. - Skol. Skol. - Ingrid and I were cheerleaders|together in high school. Red, white, fight, fight. Who fight? Red, white!|Fight, fight! Fight! She was the "Exchange student extraordinaire", I was of course " Miss personality". Now, Ingrid's best friend is Heidi|and Heidi's best friend is Heidi. Heidi one and Heidi two.|- Heidi iho. Heidi one doesn't speak any English|but is just, knocked out by America.|Aren't you, Heidi? - Yes. And... and American men. She says yes to everything.|It's the only word she knows. I think I've died and|I'm gone to heaven. Let's bring them along, we play game,|they can cheerlead, you and me. Allright, make the take. Ten zip. My ball. Twenty-one. Jake, Jake he's our man.|If he can't do it, nobody can. Jake, Jake he's our man.|If he can't do it, nobody can. Hey, what about me?|Isn't anybody going to cheer for me? Huddle up, huddle up! Jake... Three! I'm surprised at you, Tom.|From the way you talked, I figured you'be a lot quicker.|Must be the beer, the latitude. Doctor Jack, my ass. Get off the court,|get off the court now. Just get off the court,|you're gonna get hurt. Tom, Tom, he's our man. Jake, you want some oxygen? You did that when you were a kid, Michael? Make belive you were an announcer|calling big game? Time out! Time out!|Medical time out. Chapagne break. Poor baby.|- You get a cold towel, not too bad. Fuck! Jake, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to fuck up|your beautiful floor. No wait.|- Did you get a towel? Get a towel. Just wipe it up with this. No, no! Shit, you need a...|I have a thing... Contraceptive? Hope and fear rolled into me.|Talk about paranoia. Talk about wishful thinking.|- Come on Michael. Let's go. I'll be back|I'm gonna toss this guy off. No basket, it's my ball You drew blood, you lose, pal.|That was an intentional foul. I'll let it slide this time,|but don't let it happen again. You got that? Oh!|- Excellent. I might have underestimated your|athletic ability there, Jake, but I could tell you lived in such|a place just by looking at you. Just one look and you said I was|living in a renovated glue factory? I could tell by your shoes. You could|tell almost everything from them. Come on, Jake! Chicks in worn heels,|cracked insteps and scuffs. I can see their kitchen sinks,|cigarette butts, plates piled high|with mouldy food. Now, chicks in two hundred|dollar shoes from Paris. I can tell, not a scuff|on the heels of toes. I can take one look at 'em|and know everything I need. Yeah? What do you know? I know what they're gonna smell like.|What they're gonna feel like Is that right, Tom?|Is that why you sell shoes? To pull up the shades|to their souls? Or you're gonna look at their feet|once a while? Maybe to catch a glimpse|up their skirts. I bet you keep a score card of how|many of them don't wear panties. Tell me I'm right. Jake!|- This is crazy! Stop it! That's twice.|- Yeah? Who the fuck cares?|Tell me what she smelled like. Tell you who smelled like?|- The chick in the 200$ shoes. Was it like ivory snow?|Was it like fresh soap? I ain't talking about a chick.|I'm talking about chicks in general. And how many chicks|are chicks in general? Four, eight, ten,|twelve, twenty? This is it! It's over! What do you call them when they're|all clumped together? Gaggle? Phalanx? Choir? Possyy? Stop it, Jack. Someone's gonna|get hurt. I'm serious. What the fuck are you talking about? Tell me what she felt like. Soft as a baby's butt?|Soft as a kidskin glove? You're fucking nuts, man. Am I? Tell me about these chicks. You know what they smell like|and you know what that taste like. Do you know what's inside their|heads? Anything about them? Do you know what makes them laugh?|What makes them scream? All I know is that|they all love shoes. Every single one of them. And they go on buyin'em|until they die. Guys, this is it.|Hey, stop! Fuck, man! You fucking win! Take your fucking goddamn money.|Here it is, take it. Take the fucking money and|shove it up your fucking ass. Where is the bathroom?|- Straight ahead. Don't quit now, Stanley.|We're just getting warmed up. C'mon. I'll double your money|and I'll spot you five more points, and I'll still take you. That's your problem,|you give up too easy. Just think, if you had that part|of Stanley Kowalski in high scool, you could have been a star, you could have been out of the shoe|business into the show business. You could have chicks raining|down on you. Gaggles of them. Litters of them. Covens.|Choirs, Phalanxes. xxxxxxxxxxxx You're a fucking shoe salesman,|you get down on your knees and you look up their skirts,|that's all you do. Get a real job, punk! You mother fucker. Shit, shit, shit! I miss her so much. She would always tell me|that I was okay. And that was pretty tough. No. I'm in love with a lady who|wears two hundred dollar shoes. She was never a chick.
