It's a departure for me in many ways, as you know-- you've really been so loyal and I appreciate that so much. Ms. Lear? What statement are you trying to make with this collection? Well, I think I'd like the work to speak for itself. So, what did you think? Another grand opening. Really? Really. Really and truly. A toast. .su o To us. Dan! What? I'll drive home. Sweetheart, I'm fine. Miss Lear, one more thing. I forgot to ask you this question. Why don't you come by the gallery tomorrow? Okay, great. Dan, stop! You alright? Yeah. Stay with me! We're losing him. He's dead. The man and the baby. Both D.O.A. Ali, are you sure about this? What's the alternative? Some halfway house for the newly impaired? That's not me. I agree. I want to go home. It's not that easy. You're alone now. Just a minute! This is going to be Jeff, the young man I spoke to you about. I don't want help. I understand that you don't want to be a burden on anyone and it's too soon for you to see your old friends. But what am I supposed to do? Kick you to the curb? Come on! You need someone. Come in! Jeff McAuley, Alejandra Lear. The artist, right? Used to be. Ali the blind now. Jeff will help you through the adjustment period. He can be a great help. I don't want any help. I need to do this on my own. I know, I understand, but you need someone to help you start. Jeff can be there at your discretion. He can be there as much or as little as you need. Right? Of course. You're doing the right thing. What do you mean? Dr. Weinette wanted you to stay at the hospital. Did you go to school for this? All my life. My mother's blind. There's a ton of mail and stuff. I'll get it for you later. Thank you. You okay? Yeah. I'm right here. Here. Why don't you come over here to this table. I'll be right back. I'm going to go put the groceries down. I'm going to show you around, okay? Whoa! You just lost your spot. Here. Go back to a spot you know. Now, picture it from here. Just the way you remember. Jenny's room. That's my daughter's room. This staircase-- My bedroom is up there. This is my studio. Please stay out. Sure. What time is it? About 4:00? Yeah, I guess. The doves will be here soon. I spent hours, endless hours, painting, sketching, studying. Just staring at the colours and the light. Watching them come and go. Jenny loved them. Anything else? No, I'm fine. Alright, then. See you tomorrow. Thank you. I'll lock the door on the way out. Goodnight. Goodnight. Ali? You okay? Ali? Is everything okay? Ali. This is my fault. What's your fault? Listen-- do you hear that? I don't hear anything. Exactly. You should hear Jenny laughing and Daniel telling her where her shoes belong and instead you hear nothing. Ali, you can't blame yourself. Maybe I shouldn't have come here. Hey. You had to come back. You know that, right? How about I make some coffee? Smells good. There is a cup waiting for you right here on the counter. Shoot. I got this. This is a tough place to get around. You just have to dance. What? When I was a kid, I asked my mom how she learned to get around. She said, "It's just like dancing". Dancing? Dancing. One, two, three-- green chair. One, two, three-- other green chair. One, two, three-- we're in open space. One, two, three-- Couch! We're at the couch! Yes! You got it! Great job. So, does your mother use a cane or a guide dog? Dog, named Jeff. She was allergic and I looked good in a harness. Hello! Hi. Hi! Listen, I embossed a number one on your debit card, a number two on your credit card. Uh, you have some cash here, so I folded the 20's in half and the 10's in thirds and I didn't fold the singles. Coins are easy because they're different sizes. You're amazing, thank you. Oh, no problem. You'll get used to a cash-free life. It just makes things easier. Right. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. You want to stay a little while off the clock? Oh, I'm sorry. You probably have plans or a girlfriend. I didn't mean to cross any boundaries. No, no, no girlfriend. No place to be. I'm not prying. I know. I'm just-- pretty shy person, I'm sure you've seen that. Yeah. You're really talented. Thanks. You can still-- No, I don't think so. Those days are over. "Jeff" short for-- Jeffrey. Jeffrey, I like that. Can I call you "Jeffrey"? Okay. I don't know what you look like. Do you mind? Sure. Are you blushing, Jeffrey? Yeah, I could feel that. You're handsome. I really should get going. Oh-- right. Yeah, wait, I'll uh-- I'll walk you to the-- to the door. I don't think I'll ever get used to this. Sure you will. It'll take a little time and it won't be easy, but you will. It's open! Jeff? You shouldn't do that. Shouldn't do what? Leave the door unlocked and tell someone to come in. I was expecting you. Besides, you have a key. For emergencies. You're starting to get around pretty well, but you're still blind. You want a cup of coffee? No, I don't want a cup of coffee. I know you're right. But it's just not the way I want to live my life. It's not me. Hello? Hello? Jeffrey? Hello, Ali Lear. Ali, good morning. Dr. Weinette, how are you? I should be asking you that. Well, I'm good. Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that. I was planning on dropping by in a few days and checking in on you in person. You should come by, Doctor. I would love to see you. I will. Okay, looking forward to it. Me too. See you soon. Bye. Just a minute! Ow! Hi. Good morning. Ow. What's the matter? Oh, I just hit my leg on the table. I missed my spot. Bagels? I smelled them before I opened the door. Your senses are increasing. That's good. Is it my turn to make the coffee? Yep. After breakfast, I'm going to go to the market. I want to come! On course. Okay, now you're about-- from the curb. Slow. You can hear the traffic a little bit. A little bit more to your right. That's the cross signal button. Go over and push it. There it is. Now, listen for the signal. AUTOMATED VOICE: Wait. Okay, here goes. Okay, there you go. Oh! That was a huge leap of faith. You did great. We all go once around Mostly up Sometimes down Don't bring me down Beautiful flowers. Oh, flowers! Hello again! Hello. I'm Linda, your new neighbour. Your only neighbour, from the looks of things. Oh, right. The girl we saw the other day. I was just moving in. Well, it's nice to meet you. I'm Ali and this is my aid, Jeffrey. Hi. I'm sorry, I didn't even realize-- Don't apologize, please. It's embarrassing. Well, it's nice to officially meet you both. I was feeling kind of lonely across the street all by myself. Well, come by any time! Really? Yeah. Let me-- let me show you something. They have the best incense over here. Can I-- do you want to go with me? Yeah, sure, sure! How long have you lived here? Oh, a long time. Seven years. Oh, wow! Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to learn the neighbourhood. I'm going to make you dinner. Okay, great. It'll be nice to have a friend nearby. What does she look like? I don't know-- brown hair. I think she liked you. Why would you say that? 'Cause she perked up when she heard you were my aid. I guess she thought we were a couple. The studio door is open. Yeah, I thought I heard something there this morning. It was just my imagination. Want me to close it? Doesn't matter. Well, you asked me not to go in there. Well, that was before I knew you. Go ahead, look around. Your work is really inspiring. Thank you. You know, you could still do those things. No. At least the sculpting. You're always saying you have nothing but time on your hands. I'm not ready yet. Maybe you could teach me? Come on. I don't know. I'll get it. Yes? Hello, I'm looking for Ali Lear. Alejandra. Yes. And you are? Alex Smith, reporter with the Times. No. I'd just like to speak with her. Ms. Lear is in no condition to speak to anyone. You need to leave. And who are you? Who am I? I'm her caretaker. She relies on me for everything. She does not take a step without me. I am her eyes. Now, Ms. Lear wants her privacy. Ms. Lear needs her privacy and you need to leave-- now! Who was it? No one. It was that reporter looking for you. Just relax. It's just that people like that-- they just piss me off. You should be a chef. I learned from my mom. She was a good cook, it was her art. My mother wasn't much of a cook. She wasn't really much of a homemaker at all. I should go. I'll see you tomorrow. I had a good time today. Me, too. Lock the door. Yes, Jeffrey. ALI: Jeffrey, is that you? Yeah. We're having coffee. Linda brought croissants. Just a sec. 'Morning. Hey there. Hey, Jeffrey. It's good to see you. How are you doing? Good, I'm good. What's up? Linda came by on her way to work. She has a great idea. Oh, yeah? What's that? Bob! Linda! Hey! What are you doing here? I thought you graduated. Oh yes, I did. Long ago. I just wanted to show my friends where I grew up. Bob, this is Ali. Hi. And this is Jeff. Hey, Jeff. You got some ID? Alright. Cool, good seeing you! Talk to you later. Linda, what's his problem? No problem. He's doing his job. Why didn't he ask Ali to see her ID? The strangest thing Just happened Can I get a vodka cranberry, please? Hi. Hi. Everything Has changed Oh, God. Thank you for tonight. It was really fun. It was a great idea. Do you mind walking me to my door? I'm the only one in the building right now. It's kind of creepy. I don't want to-- It's okay, I'll be fine. Goodnight. Oh, goodnight! I'll be right back. So, did you have fun tonight? It was okay. I was thinking, um, maybe you and I could go out sometime. No, I don't think so. Are you and Ali-- No. But you like her? Well, I guess she's pretty enough, but-- it's just that I have a girlfriend. Oh. I'm sorry. So? So? Nothing. To be honest, it's empty. I don't have anybody to care about, nobody to love. I tried to warn you. I know you did. You were right about something else, too. Oh? And what is that? Jeff. He's been a big help. Oh, great. You two are getting along? Mm-hmm. Any problems? Don't take this the wrong way-- I don't know what I'd do without him. But? But he's a little... possessive. Possessive? How? Yeah, a friend came by the other day and it was-- I don't know, like, like he was jealous. A male friend? Mm-mm. Actually, a female friend who's just moved in across the street in the neighbourhood. She has a crush on him and it makes him I guess, uncomfortable. And he's just-- I don't think it has anything to do with that and I'm sure it's nothing, but it just was-- you know. He can be an intense young man. Yeah, you think? Jeff, look who's here! Hi, Doc. Hey, Jeff. How are you? Good, I'm good. How are you? I'm well, thank you. So, what brings you by? Oh, I came by to see my patient and you. Oh? To tell the truth, I have to be going, but I was stalling hoping to see you. Well, here I am. I was telling Lisa how good you've been to me. Really helpful. No, honestly, Jeff, she just told me you were a natural caregiver. You should really consider a career in rehab. We should talk about it. I mean, Ali's not going to need you forever. Yeah, the good doctor has just dropped by an application to begin the process to get a guide dog. Really? You never mentioned a dog before. No, I really never thought about it but now that I do, I think it's a great idea. It's just-- it's just not as simple as all that. I know, but I think it's a great idea You're always worrying about me. A dog could protect me. Thank you for coming by. Mm, it was my pleasure. And like I said, you and Jeff fill out those forms and then he can drop it off at my office and when you do, we should talk about your new calling. Helping the blind. Yes, of course. What are you hiding from the blind lady? Play your little game, but you're going to have to tell me after breakfast. Alright. Promise? Promise. Loosen it up. Then you have to figure out what you want to make. I dunno. Uh, how about a rock? You have to make something a little more complicated. How about... a dragon? If you say so. What about you? First to make the body. Oh my gosh, it's something. It's so painful, you just have to laugh through your tears. Jeffrey, look who stopped by! Hey, Jeffrey! Nice dragon, by the way. And your mask is so good. You really are talented. Ha ha. No, seriously! Don't-- you don't give yourself enough credit. Um, look, I need to get going. I have some work I gotta finish. Thanks for-- No, I'll walk you out. It's just so good to get all that out, you know? I'm glad you came by. Yeah, it was-- I'm a very good therapist. I can't figure out my own life but I can help you with yours. Thank you! I'll see you soon. Okay. Bye, Jeffrey! See you later. Bye. What was that about? Hmm? What? Not even a hello? What was she doing here? Every time I turn around, she's here. Are you inviting her? She dropped by after work. Yeah. Maybe she has a crush on you-- whatever. but that doesn't give you the right to be rude to people. I just worry about you and strangers. She's not a stranger. This is my home, you're a guest in it just like Linda is a guest in it, and I expect my guests to be nice to each other. I'm sorry. I'll see you. Linda. Jeff, hi. I want to apologize for the other day. Apologize? I was rude to you. It's okay, I mean, I surprised you and-- after the other night and all. Well, have a nice day. Damn, I've been doing that all day. Can you help me find a vase? You were right. I was rude to Linda yesterday. So, I went over to apologize. That's sweet of you, Jeffrey. I was too hard on you. I upset you, so-- Thanks. Vase, vase-- God, I've been so off today. I put rice in my bowl this morning instead of oatmeal. Thank God I've got you around. Don't know what I'd do without you. Here's one. Oh, thanks. I'll get it. What do you think? Nice. So, what was the delivery? Binoculars, telescope, reading glasses? I don't think you should see it. Oh, don't tease. Seriously, Ali, I don't know. What are you talking about? It's the personal effects from your accident. What do you mean, "personal effects"? What's in it? Some children's shoes. A few purses, a handkerchief, a camera. Oh my God... There's a letter. Who would send this? Who the hell would send this? It's the insurance company's policy to release the items once the-- Give this to me. It's just unbelievable how it hit me. I'm a little stunned, I guess. Thanks, Linda, that's why I called. I just wanted to hear a friendly voice. Yeah, he's here but you know how it is. He's a man, it's just not the... Yeah, you got it. Bye. What are you doing? Just making sure the camera still works. What did I hear? It was some things you had recorded. Here, take it. No, I don't want it. Just promise me you'll erase everything on it. You sure? Ali? Can I get you anything? Ali? Ali? Wake up! Ali, come on. You should go up to bed. Jeffrey? Get ready for bed and I'll go get your pill, okay? Mind if I come up? There you go. I'll see you in the morning. Bye. Ali? Ali? Are you awake? You are so beautiful. What's the matter? Nothing, I'm just restless. Tired of sitting around here all day and doing nothing. Well, why don't we go for a walk when I'm done with this? No. Is Linda home? I don't know. Give her a call. No, I want to surprise her. I could tell her about the dog. Is her car there? Yeah. Oh my God, Ali! Hi! Hi! Uh... Please, what are you doing? Come in! Honey, I'm home! What are you doing? when you were ready to come back. Well, I had to at least try. Besides, Linda was watching me. I'm the one taking care of you. I know that, and you do. I would have never gotten this far without you but I can't lean on you forever. I know, but-- I like doing things for you, I like the way we are. You're one in a million. You know, this just means more freedom for you. I'm not going to need you as much. What do you mean? You'll have more time to yourself. I'm not going to rely on you. What's the matter? Nothing. What can I do? Here, help me finish the salad-- tear these up. Did you know that she's a graphic artist? Who? Linda. No. Well, I invited her to dinner on Sunday. I thought it would be nice. I'm sure it will be. Jeffrey, I'm not trying to set you two up. She's a friend, she's alone like us. You don't have to explain yourself, Ali. Well, then let's shop tomorrow. Would you? Sure. Hi! Hi. How are you? Good, good. How are you? Good! Thank you so much for having me over. I have been looking forward to this all day. Us, too. Hi! Hi! How's it going? Good. Oh, that smells so good! What is it? It is sweet potato casserole. Do you want a glass of wine? Oh, I would love one, thank you. Can I help you? Yeah. What can I do? It's a mess. There's some potatoes. No? Aww. I tease. I do, I do. To friends. To friends. To friends. To friends. Thank you for having me over. Aw, I'm so glad you came. Aren't you, Jeffrey? Thank you for cooking. Yeah, no problem. Anybody want anything more? Oh, my gosh. Can I borrow your restroom? I think I had too much wine. Where is it? Oh, it's right back there. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Wow. Mmm. That was good, wasn't it? Mmm. Are you kidding? It was great. Yeah, it's nice having someone over, isn't it? Of course it is. Yeah. Um, I'd better go. I've had too much wine. Oh, me too. I'm just gonna, um-- goodnight. Oh, let me get your dish! I'll get it tomorrow. Okay. Bye. Thanks for coming. Tired? Don't worry, I'll clean up. I won't argue with that. Your head hurt? Mm-hmm. Alright, well, you just get comfortable and I'll get your pill. Thanks. Want some tea? Mm-hmm. Okay. Here you go. Here's your pill and here's your tea. Hmm. It smells good. Who is it? Jeff. I brought your dish over. You didn't have to do that. I could have gotten it another time. But I want to talk to you, too. About what? About earlier this evening. Look, it's late and I've got work in the morning so, I just don't-- It'll just take a minute. Ah, I just really want to thank you for coming over tonight. Ali's really happy. And I want to thank you for not saying anything about the pictures. What is going on over there? Well, maybe Ali and I are more than friends now. No. No, she would have said something. Why did you have to come around? Couldn't you just leave us alone? Look, I don't know what you're doing to Ali, but I'm going to put an end to it! Now, I want you out of here before I call the police. One-- Leave us alone. Two-- Stay away! Three. Leave-- us-- alone! Hey. You scared the hell out of me. Oh, I shouldn't have taken a pill after having so much wine last night. Is that coffee? Oh, good. Do you remember going to bed last night? Uh, no. I had to wake you up and send you upstairs. Yeah, I don't remember a thing. Would you excuse me for a second? You okay? Yeah, I'm still a little woozy. What did you break? I knocked a picture off the wall. Careful, there's glass. Something feels different about this picture. What do you mean? It just doesn't feel right. Let me see. Here. Uh, looks like the glass cut it. Oh no, which picture is it? It's of, uh, you and your daughter and your husband. Why don't I take it and see what I can do with it and put some new glass in here? Let's get you out of here. I'll come back and clean it up. What are you doing? Uh, just playing around. I thought we could go to the nursery today. Maybe Linda will want to go. Is her car outside? No. Is she back yet? Uh, I don't know. Maybe she went on vacation or something. Hi, it's Linda. You know the drill! Hi, Linda, it's Ali again. Call me when you get in. I wonder where she is. I hope everything's okay. I'm sure it is. I'm just a little worried. It's been days. I'll see you tomorrow. Already? Yeah, I'm tired. Okay. Goodnight. 'Night. Hi, it's Linda. You know the drill! Linda? Linda? Oh my-- Oh, no! Oh, no! I want you to canvass the area three blocks in every direction. Talk to anyone you see. Indigent, homeless-- I don't care. Every neighbour in every building. Check the roofs, do not pollute the crime scene. You know the drill. Ali! What happened? Were you attacked? Linda's dead. What? How? She found the body. What happened? You're Jeffrey McAuley? Yes. Detective Roy Archer. I need to ask Ms. Lear some questions. But she's pretty distraught. She was asking for you, so I just thought we'd wait. Thanks. She lives right over here. If we could just-- Sure. So, the last time you saw the deceased was three nights ago. Yes. She came over for dinner. And neither of you are aware of any enemies the deceased may have had-- ex-boyfriends? No. No enemies or exes that I know of. But we didn't know her very well. Jeff! Ali, we didn't. She moved in, we met her. We hung out a few times, but-- that's all we really know. You say she mentioned being scared. She said that. But I thought she was just talking. For attention, you know. Right. She was like that. So, you don't think she had any reason to be scared? I don't know. Not more than anyone else. The neighbourhood is what it is. Well, there were signs of a burglary, but no forced entry, which means Miss Gamon knew her assailant. Or at least let him in. I don't want to speak badly about anyone but I think you should consider the possibility that she brought someone home. A man, I mean. She-- she was aggressive sexually. Jeff! Ali-- you don't know and I didn't want to say anything, but-- Did you see someone or what? No, no, nothing like that. But she came on to me pretty aggressively one night. I just think that maybe you should consider the possibility. Maybe. Maybe. Tell me, Mr. McAuley, when she came on to you, did you encourage her in any way? No. Well, the murder weapon appears to have been a plate or a dish of some sort. A plate? Well, not really a plate. A heavy dish of some sort. We found small pieces of ceramic in her wounds. A casserole dish? Yeah, maybe. You said Miss Gamon brought something over for dinner? Yes. Did she take it when she left? No. No, she left it here. May I see it? It might be part of a set. Sure. Is that the dish? She brought some sweet potato stuff in it. Let's have a look. Alright. That's it for now. If you remember anything else, please give me a call. We will, thanks. Good. Poor Linda. I just want to take a shower. Me, too. When I get home. Jeffrey, can you stay here tonight? I don't want to be alone. I'll be right back. I just need to change my clothes. Thank you. My name's Alex Smith, I'm a reporter with the Times. I just want to find out what's going on here. Can you tell me what happened? Ali, it's Dr. Weinette. I hate to leave a message like this but I was doing some digging into Jeffrey's past and, well, I have-- I have some serious concerns. Please call me on my cell as soon as you can. It's urgent. Will help you through the adjustment period. He can be a great help. Something feels different about this picture. What do you mean? It just doesn't feel right. Just making sure the camera still works. This is mine. I'm sorry, Ali. I knew it was wrong but I just couldn't help it. I couldn't help myself. I just wanted to be close to you like they were. Please don't say that. It's so much better when I'm here with you. Better than what? Than my life ever was. This is my life, Jeffrey. You can't just take it like that. I'm not taking it. I just want to be a part of it. I want to help you. Don't be scared of me. Ali... I love you. You have no idea what it was like coming here every day, seeing you, not being able to tell you how I feel. I found this. Give me that! I'll give it to you, you son of a bitch. You shouldn't have done that! You gave that to me! That was mine! Oh my God. Jeff? Jeffrey? Jeffrey? Jeffrey? I know where you are. What are you doing? I am protecting us from them-- from all of them! Why did you kill Linda? What? Why did you kill Linda? Because she was trying to force us apart. She was trying to-- Damn it! I can't see! Where are you? Where are you?! Ugh, damn it! Where are you?! Ali! Where are you?! Where are you?! You think you can get away from me? You want me? Good. Come here. I'm right here. Find the blind lady. Come on. He always talked about her in the past tense, so how was I to know? You thought she was dead? Yes, I thought his mother was dead. But she had met someone, a man, and when she did, Jeffrey became very paranoid, abusive. So much so that she had to actually leave town. No one knew. Not even Dr. Weinette. Dr. Weinette? Dr. Weinette. Every time I speak to her, I hear remorse in her voice. She feels responsible. In a way, she-- No, there was no way to see. No way to know what was going to happen. I just have to make the best out of an awful situation. I-- I never thought that I would make another piece of art or have the privilege to teach a single student.
