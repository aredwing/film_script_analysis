Mother do not think it is a good idea. Maybe it's not so bad to go to boarding school. I had hoped, that we would fit. But it feels like, the circus has come to town. He is a real little cricket star and has received a scholarship. And he sings like an angel. Is not that right, honey? - Choirmaster. - I like choirboys. Look here! That's fine, what? My new home. It smells like foot odor and floor polish. Calm down! I'll never fit. I am after all not the only one. There are many blacks here. Quiet, please. Good morning, boys and your parents. I am president ... - Rector. Nicknames "Glock". - My name is mr. Glockenspheel. - It is not something to laugh at. - I love you so much! Lie never be anything. Even the Queen must damn once a day. Goodbye, darling! I will miss you. Tomorrow it begins. Perhaps I die during the night, and get rid of it. Turn off the light! Mother? What have we here? It looks like one silkworms with eating disorder. It looks like a potato, a small spud! Everybody has a nickname. My is Spud. My dick is small, and my nuts are not dropped. If I have to survive here, I have become friends with the other. Especially with Robert Black - "Rambo", dormitory self-proclaimed king. He gangs in every sentence- - and demands to be respected and honored. I have become friends with Rambos gang, for example, Charlie Hooper ... ... "The mad dog". His hobby is destruction and death. Or should I be sports star as Simon Brown - "Simon Brown". Or I can get my hands on a lot prohibited girlie- - as Al Greenstein - "barrel". He is a sexgalning, which I think is a good thing. Or should I beat school farting record. held by Sidney Sibeko-Scott - "Cool". Thanks for Henry Barker - "Gekko". Vern Blackadder - "Rain Man". Otherwise, they bullied me. My new home is like a war zone. I'd been an uncomfortable feeling that soon it's my turn. - All calls us "The crazy eight". - What's going on here?! Who started it? - What's your name? - John Milton. - John Milton, sir! - John Milton, sir. U d with language. I really do not know. As you will ... From now on, all your privileges revoked. Next time I'm not so indulgent. Go with him to the doctor. It was not your fault. It was not good to be seen with Gekko, the school's most stupid guy. It's a madhouse. There is always someone who is after you or mock you. Do not you think Milton? This better be serious. Thank you, Milton. DIE NOT HERE IT SHOULD I DO IN HOLIDAY Check them right there! I do not recall, to have invited you, Spud. He could not tear it off for so he had tweezers and magnifying glass. - Even if he had a map. - Balls feel lonely. It is not fair. Even Gekko has got hair on. I wonder when I can begin to tear it off? - I wonder how suicide feels? - This is my seven tenders: - Mr. Wilson, our teacher. - 1 I must obey the authorities. - "rib." - 2 You must not behave indecently. Rambo told that a lion bed half of his shoulder by. doctors had to use a ribs to make it. 5th I do not play with yourself or with each other. - 6 I can not play darts. - There is no dart boards. 7th Consider not even To do this ...

Dad would have reconsidered, the wallet was still there. Good God. Oh horror, oh horror! The heart can not understand it ... you are quite dumb ... Let the trumpets speak! These vocal messengers- - Of blood and death! With me, study the literature. Not the anemic nonsense- - A self-absorbed literary gay. Example 1: Henry James. Example 2: Virginia Woolf and Agatha Christie. Frustrated and sex-mad lesbians with underarm hair. Not get me wrong, boys. I have nothing against lesbians. I would personally give them a swing. Mr. Edly - "Head". He is as mad as my family, maybe more. Either way, I get to teach you smelly suri cat - How to become men. You will learn about women and sex. If I do it well, you become the kind of men that you envy- - And the kind of men that women can not resist. Literature is my favorite. Just Head teaches me to score girls as mrs. Wilson, rib wife. nickname "Eve" since Eve came from Adam's rib. I got almost goosebumps. I was about to pee in my pants! - Yes, Robert? - You lost your pencil. Thursday is movie night. Today, "Pretty Woman" with Julia Roberts. She plays a sexy prostitute. After school, I would drive around and look for prostitutes. You can watch the movie later. President F. W. de Klerk opened parliament- - with what is described , an epoch-making speech. Among other things, increased ban against African National Congress. Father says that the ANC's communists.

Spud, do you want all at school must think you're a sissy? It did not expect to. And therefore I with a mission. It becomes dangerous. It gets crazy. We can be kicked out of school. We may even die. Who is on a prohibited completely mad dip? I will not. But Gekko, there must be no witnesses. One for all, all for one. - Spud? - No witnesses. Spud! Wait! We did it! Guys! Where's Cool? Guys ... Try to get him free. Good grief! We get kicked out. Shut up! We will not be thrown out. Do not be such a sissy. Rambo saved the day. He said that Fede was stuck because he would visit the Holy Spirit. It's a miracle! - Well done. - Establishing! I know exactly what I had last night. What do you think? We were sleeping. Ask anyone of us. Okay? Is it true Milton? A boy was close to death! Train in a dip, or did not you? Six strokes for each of you, when I come back after the weekend. Take care, I will think of you. Super ... Thank you, Spud. The 158 km long trip home felt infinite - and fattened breath smelled of fish. did nothing, I was on my way home. Get into the car. Your father is gone mad. I kill him. Mother not exaggerating. Dad has built our house into a bunker. Open the gate! What is this all about?! Marge and Denise from book club will by! How do they come in? - Remove barbed wire! - So are we vulnerable to attack! - From who?! - Communists! Maybe the school is not so bad. Dad was mad. He says that we will live in poverty. He fired Innocence. He thinks she is a terrorist. Is it really to live in poverty? And then I saw her. - There for a lightning bolt through my body. - This is Marge's daughter, Debbie. She said a single word, which almost knocked me over with its beauty. I promised Debs, that she could swim in your pool. Jump in, Johnny, it's hot. I'm in love with a mermaid. - I'm really sorry. - Forget it! Next! Think about what you love most, so overcomes you pain. Next! Bend forward. Jacket. It's going to hurt. Kiss me, John.

Come on, Johnny! That's my boy! Do not play smart. Two rim if you gramser, five if you take her on breast- - And ten, if you touch her the most holy place. - It costs five to be with. - I'm with. I save the worst for last ... Stand up, Milton. This young man is a good example on what women crave. He is the only one of you fools- - Who has scored more than 50% of the job. You can sit down. I had to write about influence in modern literature. Is this it best you baboons For the? Dumped. Not one of you came in. the greatest influence of all. If it were not for sex, adultery- - Fornication, korpulering and knalderi- - There would never have been written a single book. - But what about the Bible? - Good question. Milton! Bible ... Clean or sexy? Grandma says that it is full of sodomy and incest, and should be banned for children. Exactly! Well, I puberty monkeys. Auf Wiedersehen! - John ... - Yes, sir? Welcome to Paradise Lost. Your grandmother sounds to be an interesting slut. Yes, sir. She is potty. She calls me David, and we call her Wombat. My whole family is actually quite crazy. So I have the perfect book for you. It is not really a book, it's a play. It's called "The absurd drama". - Thank you, sir. - Do not thank me, just read it! So can you tell us what you think. I think it is fantastic. - Get out now, there is lunch. - Yes, sir. I hoped that the play would act on how scores. But it is about two tramps, living in a ditch. They are waiting for a man, named Godot. But he never arrived. It's creepy strange. SCHOOL game becomes "OLIVER TWIST. "TEST TOMORROW This is it.

Relax, you're stiff as a stick. Drink a little wine. - I have not. - Nonsense. What do you think? - About what? - Drama. I do not know. Oh, Johnno ... I guess I do not have to yell at you? Tell Just. - Nothing happens. - Exactly. It's like life. We are waiting for something to happen, but it does not. And what are we waiting for? God? The meaning of life? Death? Perhaps we are waiting to become adults. But it will never be. Wise words, young man. Let's drink to it. Why is it absurd? The sound normal. We are sitting here surrounded of a kind of fantasy world. The actual absurd is that most not seem to notice it. - The school is the most absurd world. - And I've taught here for 27 years. An absurd vagrant in a ditch ... ... The wayside. My mother believes that God's greatest gift to humanity's freedom of choice. It is not something one should take lightly. This is undoubtedly the best book that is written. It is proof that God indeed exists. These are strong words from a devout atheist. To be or not, this is the case. Is it a nobler mind that withstands the wild fate arrows shot ... John ... You must display home now. Arrows Target ... - What is it, honey? - An end, we sincerely may desire. Pathetic! Next! - Well, Milton, what would you sing? - Amazing Grace. Thank you! Next! Thank you, Milton. I feel just like Hobbit - small and lonely. Just less hairy. HOLIDAY holidays. All that before made me happy does not mean anything anymore. I needed a plan, but could not find anything. Innocence is back. She pulled father in law. - I told you. - Now she sits in power. Ask them there. Wombat to eat lunch with us. Father says she is a part of satan. She is a part of satan! It's eleven. You can not be there all day. Have not you got yourself some friends, you can invite over? I ask Debbie, if she wants to and baths. Hey. Was it really wise to let mermaid meet my family? Get now not busted bitch thick. David is such a pretty boy. Thank God he looks like not his father. I do not understand, why you married him. He looks like scrambled eggs in the face. What are you doing? I was sure that the mermaid would never see us again. What is it that is so funny? I talked about school and the crazy eight. She laughed really very I just had to kiss her. So I could tell the others. Now it's confirmed. Spud Milton has no balls. SECOND SEMESTER must change to.

Last year he had a heart attack in "Pirates of Penzance". chief plays Fagin. But he fills his hip flask with real whiskey. Eva plays the prostitutes Nancy.

Talk about the right for the role. - Are you okay? - I just play. Very convincing. - If you say anything, I'll kill you. - About what? Rugby Season. I wonder if "Oliver Twist" get the same response? Not like the response to my team. But it may be that coach is mr. Lilly, visual arts teacher. He does not believe in tackles. Much better! More pressure from the rear. They have arrived! I'll probably all say hello girls from St. Catherine welcome. Quiet! - Amanda. Amanda plays Beth. - John Milton plays Oliver. Amanda Lawrence, too beautiful to have a nickname. I am totally scared of her. I know your dirty little minds, and I do not accept it. Neither flirting, gramseri, petting, kissing or worse. - It is the best book I have read. - Wonderful! What book!

Does it have anything with a potato to do? - I have to move. - Come on, it's us now. Just vote is not in transition! No one knows what is wrong. I hope it's over with Spud. - Four sneeze is like an orgasm. - Hopefully an orgasm better. Gekko's actually pretty cool. He has had 42 diseases, six of which are completely unknown. And he takes 12 different kinds of medicine. To my beloved spud. Come to recover. I miss you. Love you. Amanda. You ... we can well make it clear she loves you. - Do you believe it? - Imagine if you score Amanda! spud is to Tyr. Spud ... When you sing ... It's as if ... I do not know. It may sound weird ...

He shares the cards out, and we play the hand.
