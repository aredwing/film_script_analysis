This way, please. Please make way for her. This way, please. - Take your time. - Morning. Morning. Not everyone can take this elevator. What do you mean? If you want to take this elevator, come before 7 am or after 10 pm. It takes you directly to 71st floor. If you're in it, it guarantees your future success. Otherwise, you'll lose your job. - Morning. - So early today? Ready. Okay. My name is Lee Xiang. Lee for Ang Lee, Xiang for dream. 24 years old. Nice to meet you! Kat. I'm in the Sales Department. What about you? The boss will decide after my probation. Why can you take the direct elevator? I'm Ben. You are? Kat. Don't be afraid. I don't bite. Lee Xiang, Lee for Ang Lee, Xiang for dream. What's going on? He's Howard. Why they come at our busiest hours? - I'm Lee Xiang... - Follow us. Xiang for dream. Look. This is our office. Everyone is working hard. Look, our colleagues are so efficient. All of us share the same belief in getting off work early. Here is photocopy room. Smoke on the rooftop. Die in the executive office. Loiter in the toilet. Gossip in the pantry. Listen carefully! Remember! Black coffee for CEO Chang, hot milk for Sophie, latte with three spoons of sugar for John, oolong tea for Kevin, Diet Coke for Kar-ling, double expresso for David, and water for everyone. Got it? Got it? Here you have to learn it the first time. CEO Chang likes black coffee, hot milk for Sophie, Kevin likes oolong tea, latte with three spoons of sugar for John, Diet Coke for Kar-ling, double expresso for David, and water for everyone. Here! Here they are! The IPO team is here! Excuse me. Up how many points today? Good. - The other two stocks? - David, please hand in the 2007 account. Chang wants it immediately. They're here? Yes. Bankers have sharp eyes for money, as befits bankers. I foresee the market price of our IPO. Lawyers are dressed lawfully in black and white. Such boring attire in youth creates no delight. Marry one lawyer and we'll never worry about the legal fight. Nice to meet you. When I see you, I see my future bright. We'll help you secure your well-being and avoid plight. We're so professional that we do things with might. Look, we belong to the same team. Look, we're social elites. Fight, going public is difficult. Our strong will leads us to light. We're the accounting team: Miky, Mary, Michael, Martin I'm Sophie. I don't have an English name. We'll do a financial checkup to check if you're sick or not. We'll do an accounting blood test to see if it's clean. With our Midas touch you'll have no problems. All the numbers will become artworks under your cooperation. We're so professional that we do things with might. Morning, Chairman. Morning, Chairman. David, you look fit! Thanks a lot, Chairman. We've been busy going public. Not much time for exercise. Do you know the relationship between Chairman Ho and CEO Chang? Chang used to be Ho's secretary. She's been working for him until he becomes a big shot. She's also his mistress. Stop it. They've been in love for 20 years. Ho's wife is a big shot. Her family is the financial source of our head office. Poor Chang is just a... CEO. Why no one dares to speak louder! Let me introduce Jones & Sunn. It grows from a small agent to the biggest trading company going public today. It's all about guts. What others dare not do, she dares. What others can't think of, she can. Where others are afraid to take accountability, she's not afraid. From fancy food, foreign wines, house appliances, to the indispensable cosmetics for women. Supermarkets, department stores, the most eye-catching shelf space. It is the joint effort of all of you. My elite team is aiming for... ...a more ambitious goal. Listen, the loyal chant is charming. Listen, the money is mellifluous. Look, we'll build a financial empire, with one heart. Raising money, expanding business, reigning over Asia, going international. Look, we belong to the same team. Look, we're social elites. Look, we'll build a financial empire with one heart. All employees will be given pre-emptive rights as bonus. We're one big family with one heart. You two are lucky... ...to learn from me. Can you make it or not? Say it out loud! I dread seeing youngsters, who only shake or nod their heads, or show me silly smiles. You got to talk in our business. It's important to be talkative. We can make it. We can make it. Draft an email for me to the wine factories in France. I'll tell you the address. Tell them: although the government announced wine tax relief months ago, the exchange rate of Euro remains high. Our profits haven't increased in proportion. Besides, we have fierce competitors in Hong Kong and we've built more wine warehouses. In the short term, our profits won't be much higher. For the present price, we would ask for a six-year contract. If they insist on a three-year contract, tell them to lower the price. Can you finish it in half an hour? It's ready. Show me. Where did you graduate from? An economics major at Harvard. Tell me, with your credentials, why you work here as an assistant? Tell the tell able truth. Because I'm inexperienced, I would like to learn more. You went to Harvard. Your family must be rich. What do your parents do? Be brief and vague. They do business. What kind of business? My father owns a siu mei restaurant. Make it more convincing. The landlord's raising the rent and my father's worried. Evade by asking questions. David, do you need any documents for tomorrow's meeting? Maybe Lee Nian and I can help you? Yes! We can prepare something for you. The applicants' CVs normally come through me. But I don't recall seeing yours. Did Chang interview you herself? Or you're hired by the head office? Do you know anyone from the head office? My name is Lee Xiang, Lee for Ang Lee, Xiang for dream. David. Busy? Not really. You're free to o! Someone will come to your rescue if you need help. Sorry. I misremembered your name. I remember now, Lee Xiang. Come over, quick! Marketing is all about efficiency. These products are misplaced. This is too high, that is too low. Look carefully and take notes. How's the sales? Which is the best-seller? Look carefully and take notes. Don't just look at the crowd. How many carry our bags? Look carefully and take notes. Customers' eyes and minds. Look carefully and take notes. David, I'm busy now. Looking at these brands, I feel the urge and the regret. It's like falling in love. I'm dazed by their look. If I don't lose my control, I would be too hypocritical. I don't have enough money to buy. It's sad but maybe I will in the future. Don't say I'm materialistic. Without famous brands, your personality and life are fake. I'll work hard. I can do everything in exchange for my love. No purchase, no happiness. I love this, I love that I want to take them all home. Unless you suffer from personality disorder, you should profess your love. I purchase, therefore I am It's good to show off to earn respect. Told you so many times. Not that I don't want to get married. I got a raise and was promoted. How can I leave? I want to buy a flat. You want to o to Shanghai. And the car loan. And your parents. We'll have children, right? How much it takes to raise a child? Hold on. Hello? It's Sophie. Manager Wu? I've been looking for you. Hold on, please. Got an important call. I'll call you back. I'll call you back. Mom, Mom, you're smiling. Daddy, Mom's smiling. Do you hope that she wakes up? She's in a coma because she's mad at you. It's the obstructed blood flow in her brain. She's not mad at me. She's mad at you. I don't know what you're thinking, or what you've heard. Don't believe in gossip. I don't want to be ordinary. I want to become closer and closer to my dream. I want to talk to my boss about my life, my dream, and my belief. Is it good? It is good. I want to be the pillar of society, to think, to do, and to take responsibility. I want to be enthusiastic, to shine, and to be a model employee. I want to be promoted and successful, but I'm anxious about it. This is the dream that obsesses me. I want to rush to pay the bills for my friends. Let me take the bills. I want everyone to see me doing great. I want to tell everyone that I'm busy but I'll be busier tomorrow. I'm everywhere every day. I'm indispensable, not an egg-laying chicken. I'm Lee Xiang. Morning, Ms. Chang. Hot lemon water, thank you. OK, I see you. I'm in a rush to trade. - Sorry. - Your coffee. Good morning. Thanks. What's new? Lehman Minibonds are sure profitable. This accumulator is hot. HSBC just distributed dividends. Perfect time to buy. Great! OK. Chang told me to sell 005. But I expect it to o higher. Sell it and buy what you just said... - Accumulator? - Accumulator How much? All in. All in? Have you asked Chang? Put them all under my account. It's OK. If it keeps rising, profit will double in less than a month. Double! Cheers! Double! Black coffee for CEO Chang. Sophie... Milk. Hot milk for Sophie. Kevin... Oolong tea. So exciting! It's like going to the battlefield. Can you tell who Kevin and Sophie are? And the rest? Get upstairs first. I don't think those teenage girls have the money to buy cosmetics! We shouldn't neglect the buying power of teenage girls. Lancome wants to open a specialty store this year because the department stores can no longer accommodate the increasing sales of cosmetics and the cutthroat competition between brands. Another issue is the rising cost of samples distributed at department stores. Who said oil price couldn't rise above USD 100? -005 up again! - David. Cosmetics is not my forte but I heard MADAME won't renew their contracts with Fungchoi. Is the image of MADAME too similar to Lancome? More brands we represent, more international we become. It's easier said than done. Who should make it work? John, have you counted how many bottles to sell to teenagers to match one eye cream of MADAME? Have you calculated? MADAM E's eye cream is priced at $880. And we buy it for $150. Why didn't you answer my call? You don't reply to my text and your phone is always off. Chang, I'm taking leave to o back to Hangzhou. Is Fungchoi not renewing contracts with MADAME or the other way around? Of course MADAME is not renewing contracts with Fungchoi. Fungchoi can't break into the Mainland market. It's all rumor. They've been in partnership for over 10 years... Business is just about making money. Ben. Yes! Didn't I say I don't drink decaf? Or you don't know how to train new hires? Sorry, my bad! I made the coffee. I don't know what is decaf or... ..."hi-caf." You're? Lee Xiang! Remember, I only drink regular black coffee. Can you remember such a simple fact? Yes. When can I give you such an expensive gift, like the one given by Chung-ping? Stop dreaming. You two are not in the same league! Sell all the stocks and get the money back. Before going public, we need to have a clean accounting record. We'd better take in one famous brand before going public. You and me. Have you ever been shortchanged? Tell you an inside information: the stock price will be rising. But we need to sell it all by next week. Who told you this? Ho Chung-Ding? Your eyes are shining when it comes to money. Smart guys control money, stupid guys are controlled by money. Is money ever enough? Can you resist the temptation? Hasn't Sophie been chasing you for the money? Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Sorry, I have to o back to finish my work! Bye. Typhoon Signal No. 3 is raised. Signal No. 8 may be raised tomorrow! No need to work. Cheers! Sorry. Where are you going? Sophie, poor Sophie. I've heard her fiance is leaving her. Why? Why? Because she doesn't want to give up work and get married. That's why her fianc is pissed off. Sophie and her fianc had a fight because she wants to stay in the city. No. Sophie wants to stay in the city because she fell in love with someone else. Who is he? David. David? How dare you spell it out! David? How's work going? Hi! How's work going? It's all right. How's work going? I'm surviving. How's work going? Big mouths wait to be fired. Chirping birds take the bullet. Too easy to find new hires. Difficult to pass probation. Too many are after this job. Use your brain, not your age. Bad mouths may well be fired. A well-dressed hen with a high salary has a high risk of being fired. Calm down! Are you fine with being a corporate slave? It's a must. Are you fine with working till you drop? Perhaps. Are you fine with being a corporate slave? We're enjoying it. Are you fine with working till you drop? If you two survive, others will be fired. I work such long hours for my baby who doesn't even know his daddy. I'm turning 40 but without man or money by my side. I'm obliged to my parents in their old age and obliged to the bank until my old age. Let's not compare with one another in jobs or for survival. Even diligent pigs want to live a decent life. Dogs have their worries, just like us. Never intent on fighting, we only want to be fed. Show me the money and I'll bow to you. Are you fine with being fired? As long as it's not me. Cheers! Don't bite your fingers. Such beautiful hands. Why so nervous? You're troubled. Can I help you in any way? I heard that you... I don't need consoling words. I don't need anyone. Sweet talk doesn't work with me. Anyway, thank you for driving me home. Please settle the accounts immediately! I have a lot of works to do. Why you hate me so much? Do you think I have nothing to do so I drive you home in such wind and rain? Morning, Ms. Chang! Morning, Ms. Chang! - This elevator isn't for you. - I'm in a rush. Let him in. Thanks a lot. Why so early? Many cosmetics are bound for shipment so I come earlier today. How long have you been here? Almost a month. Your supervisor is...David? Yes, David. Can you pass the three-month probation? Of course. It's not easy to please David. No problem! I can make it! Chang, do you remember who I am? You are Lee Xiang. You're loyal to your colleagues. I remember you. Thanks a lot. Ms. Chang, may I have a small request? Say it! If I pass the three month probation, can I take the direct elevator with you again? Sure! Let's bet on whether you can make it! Howard. I'm meeting a client at 2 pm in Eastern District. No, you can't. We have to inspect all our Southern District counters by 2:30 pm. Move the afternoon schedule to morning, can you? Ben, - Terry. - Yes! Have you fixed my battle shoes? The heels of your shoes are broken. It takes a few days to repair. My feet will be broken. - Band-Aid. - Kar-ling wants to swap her schedules. Understand? - Go! - Bring the Band-Aid. Band-Aid. Follow me! Oh my! David, something went wrong. What happened? Oh my... - Kevin, Kevin. - Yes. - Please come here. - OK. Gray & Young has finished the first phase of audit. I've handed out everything except for the 2007 account. What happened? Chang, should we consider changing a shipping company? Our goods were stolen again. - Get back to work. - Yes. John, what did the claims adjusters say? Those bastards mainly stole shipments to Mainland. They don't steal much. 10 to 20 containers. Call TGS and ask them to give us a thorough report. This isn't the first theft. Figure out how the goods got stolen. Follow up on this. Also find out how much to ship directly from Europe. Yes. David. Have you read these proposals? I've seen the same proposals for the past half year. What did "Research and Development Department" do? Their ideas are all about endorsement. I don't want an advertising firm. I want unique ideas. The management from MADAME will arrive next week. Which level of executives? Vice President, Mr. Greenberg. I've arranged dinner with him. OK, good. Shall we bring Kar-ling and John? Don't we have other talent? Bring Kat and Lee Xiang. Lee Xiang? Vice CEO Wang, you've been too busy investing in stocks to know your new recruits? Lee Xiang, Lee for Ang Lee, Xiang for dream. He reminds me of a younger you. Auntie. David said it's urgent. Please sign it immediately. Take it to my secretary. I thought you were leaving. I don't sign documents without reading them first. By the way, address me as Ms. Chang. There's no such thing as Uncle or Auntie here. Sorry. And don't ask your driver to drive you to work. Learn to take the subway and bus. Don't wear brand-name clothing. People will suspect your true identity, or think you have part-time jobs. People gossip- No one else will look out for you. Understood. We are very pleased to have the Vice Chairman of MADAME, Mr. Greenberg, and his wonderful team to be here with us tonight. Thank you for coming, welcome! I hope you'll enjoy the champagne we've chosen for you. Ms. Winnie Chang apologizes for her absence, but she did pick the restaurant and the wine herself. Anyway, Mr. Greenberg, Our company takes this meeting seriously. I'd like to introduce you to this elite team that will help you develop M Cosmetics. And please join me to look at this direction. The direction of China! And yes! The whole world is now looking at this direction! I'm sure you know that our head office has been doing business in Mainland for more than 15 years. Translate. Mr. Greenberg, You're now looking at the best team your company can rely on to expand the growth of MADAME cosmetics. Also, I'd like for you to look this direction, which is the direction of China! I told you sooner or later the American system of spending future money would collapse. It takes a formidable amount of money to rescue the "subprime mortgage crisis." It won't affect China! Mr. Ho, is your inside information reliable? - Will it affect your IPO? - Don't worry. But the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy will more or less affect the whole world economically. My company is simple and clean, no records of deficits. Will there be any problems with going public? That's good! That's great! Cheers. Thank you again for coming. To new venture! There won't be any problems. Cheers! Excuse me, Mr. Greenberg. If you're free, what do you say we meet sometime like Tuesday? Tuesday is great. I've got some small gifts for you. Hope you like them. You're too kind. Everyone has one. This is impressive! Since we're enjoying this wonderful wine, I think... A toast to new friends... - ...and working closely together! - Sure. How's the wine? - Which vintage year? 1982? Should be alright. What era is it now? What era? It is an era of financial dominance! Come on, be smart. Working is nothing. Look at me. You don't have to be that hard-working. I make a few phone calls and earn more than my salary. It's gambling. The stake is too high! Life is gambling. Your future depends on how much you put in now! Hubby, look at my bag. Good? Women are happier with bags than with husbands. You know nothing about bags. This is a limited edition. Only ten of them in the world. Your limited edition hubby is one of a kind too! An accumulator allows you to buy in stocks at a 70% discount. You can sign a half-year, 9-month, or one-year contract. Best of all, you only need one third of the principal. If the stock rises by 5%, the contract will be terminated. Profits... ...are in your pockets. - I don't get it. - Never mind! Join the game if you dare! - Come visit us in Shanghai, - Thanks for coming. - Mrs. Ho. - Take care. We can o to Hangzhou together. I love Hangzhou. Come in September and we can have some seasonal crabs. - Thank you! - Yes! Crabs are so tasty! Thank you everyone again. Thank you. Thank you Ms. Chang and Mr. Ho. Is your inside information true? Do you think I would lie? Is it a good time to o public then? It's time to see what we've got and to revamp our company. Some will leave, while others will stay, It's going to be bad but you can thrive in adversity. Don't worry, thriving in adversity is my forte! Good. Ms. Chang, please sign here. A calls me Mrs. Ho. B calls me Mrs. Ho. Where's she from? I don't know. Mrs. Ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho! Such music to my ears makes me glow. Chung-ping, the way they address me as Mrs. Ho is so natural. Hello? A perfect battle. We've defeated the enemies totally. I just sent them back to hotel. Mr. Greenberg is meeting you on Tuesday. Good job! See you on Monday. Wait, I'm coming over. I drank too much. Don't want to drive all the way home. Sorry. Not tonight. Don't drink and drive. Take care. Good night. Do you care at all? It's David. He said everything was OK. Be careful with MADAM E's financial situation. What do you mean? In a recent wine auction, they've sold all their best wine. Really? Short of cash? I don't know. We should be careful. We can negotiate in another way. All depends on you, Mrs. Ho. Good evening, sir. Coffee and a pack of cigarettes. Please place your Octopus Card here. All set. All set. Your coffee is over there. This way, madam. Cash or Octopus Card? Place your card here. Hey! You shouldn't be drinking and driving. Why don't you take a rest on the couch? Leave after you're no longer drunk. Hey! Don't think too much. We're just colleagues. You're drunk for our company. Dong calling Vibration to loud How was the champagne and wine? Steak should've been good too. Have you looked into MADAM E's sales figures in the States? We only have the Hong Kong sales figures. So you don't know? Let me tell you. This brand is famous but it's declining in American, even South Asian market. They're facing fierce competition, but without a sense of direction. The name is its sole valuable asset. So, what do you think? You haven't done your homework but at least you have some thoughts on it? Stock market is looking good, continuing the rising trend for the past two days. The Hang Seng Index hit a top of 20,909 points HSI temporarily reports at 20,803 points. Turnover of 33.4 billion. Have you come up with new ideas? I don't ask you to be ingenious but at least do use your brain. David! Stop looking at the stocks! Dong calling No cellular phone during meeting. Sorry, it's family emergency. Talk outside. Morning. Here. Morning. Morning. You're late! Take it. Go in as if nothing happened. Give me you bag. Go o o! Tell Chang Ms. Yip would like to see her. Ms. Chang... What if MADAME stopped selling cosmetics? They would just o out of business. What are you getting at? I saw on the Internet greeting cards manufacturer Hallmark started selling clothes. I was wondering what kind of clothes they would sell. Ms. Chang, Ms. Yip would like to see you. Wearing their clothes, you would look like a Christmas card. What if MADAME started selling lingerie? What's so funny? Does she want to partner with MADAME or not? What's on her mind? What she says may not be what she thinks. You'd better be careful. We can only guess what she wants. Her mind is fickle with emotion. She may think yes but says no. We'd better watch out. Naive as you are, how can you read her heart? You're also a big shot, as powerful as her art. She seems cool. Isn't she lonely? She's a supermodel. We worship her. We obey her. She's a judge. She dispenses justice. Can she feel nothing? She's a valuable investment, worth buying in and being with. To become her confidant, shall we write her a love letter or concede defeat? I don't want to become her. She seems admirable but deep in her heart Guess! Under her nose, what are we allowed to think? Guess! In her mind, what does she want? What's on her mind? What's on her mind? "Kat Ho" Is this the final version of the stakeholders? Seems to be different from what Mr. Ho has told me. This is the final version from the head office. Should be right and won't be changed. Your name is on the senior executives page. The subway was so crowded today. I almost couldn't get on the train. You don't believe me, either? You could've asked your driver to drive you here. Kat, who are you? Your dad is selling siu mei, but you have a driver. You carry a branded bag to o directly to 71st floor! You speak better English than David. Who are you? If I tell you the truth, will you keep my secret? My dad doesn't sell siu mei. Actually... He drives for the rich people living in the peak. He loves me so much that he secretly drives me to work sometimes. Do you understand now? Too many lies and too little love. Am I blushing? She's mysterious and beautiful. How can she become my close friend? The rich family is kind to us. They gave me the branded bag that they didn't want. The direct elevator to 71st floor was one-off. That security guard is my dad's friend. I was about to be late so he helped me. He almost got fired because of it. My better English comes from hard work. I'm the only child. I want to prove that I'm a good daughter. Do you understand? Yes. We all want to prove ourselves to our families. Do you believe me? I'm not myself. I don't like my real self. Do you believe I like myself only if I'm unlike myself? I do because I love you too much. I believe you. What are you angry at? Told you to sell the stocks. Did you? Dare I not? I hate myself for not being capable nor informed enough for you. Know you place. Don't ask for more. I got what I asked for. I should've known better. Lee Xiang is still green. With me, he'll be bad. With you, he'll become as immoral as me. Give him a chance to live! You pretend to be kind? David, we are the best partners. How can we harm each other? I just said he reminded me of you. What are you afraid of? Don't be afraid Asian stocks plummet. Japan stocks falls 5% to 3-year low. Korean stocks drop over 6%. Taiwan stocks drop almost 5%. The offshore stock market drops so much that The People's Bank of China cuts interest rates, but it doesn't help the Mainland stocks. Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index falls below 2000 points to 21-month low. The U.S. government is likely to take over the biggest two... The U.S. government is considering a bailout plan. Their stocks plunged and the stock market suffered. This account should be in 2006 rather than 2007. No, this account was forwarded to us in 2007 from the head office. What do you mean? This was forwarded to us from the head office. Are we waiting for the head office accounts? It's stated clearly here. OK, if the account belongs to 2007, then 2006 should be all completed. Let's begin looking at 2007. Sorry can we take a break? I'd like to... We can't sell it now. If we sell it now, we're finished. Why? Why does it plunge so rapidly? Didn't your analysis indicate it would rise by 5%? Damn! Aren't you a financial specialist? Are you alright? I have medicine. David, may I smoke with you? You alright? Sorry. I don't smoke. Then why you smoke? People smoke, whether happy or not. What for? Lucky that it's just a cigarette. Where's your hometown, Sophie? Your hometown? My hometown has good feng shui. A good place. Youthful dreams carry me away from the old home. The road in my hometown is not as wide as here. Yet people on the road don't clash with one another. It's a desire-free paradise there. Time is slow and flowing there. - In my hometown, - There are... - we study the colors - meandering brooks - of the heavens. - lush reeds. We read the origins of the universe. - Facing adversity, we fall in love - We grow old here. - with the old home. - It turns into the old home. There's adversity - Everywhere is the same. - everywhere. - There's adversity everywhere. - There's discontent everywhere. The desire-free paradise is to blame because we have too much time to imagine and desire, to imagine and venture. Venture out into the old home that buried our youth. Where to venture? Where to rush? Where to be busy? Where to imagine? Call the factories according to the list Ask in detail about their scale of production, their maximal capacity and minimal order. I'll ask David to visit the factories with you. You will observe the factories and executives. That's the best way to learn. Got you. Don't tell your colleagues about this. Got you. Hello? Is David here? David and Kar-ling are out of the office. Yes. Haven't found David? I think he killed himself! Oh! My feet ache from rubbing. Howard's gone. No one can get my battle shoes back for me. Kat, o get them tomorrow. Awesome! You're a real mimic. Kar-ling's far more capable than we imagine. Her voluptuous figure does a disservice to her. Don't look down upon women with big boobs. I got brain as well as boobs. Kar-ling, you're jealous of wise women like us. We use brain rather than breasts to think. Lee Xiang! Learn from David. Be smart and adventurous. Lee Xiang, don't tell others what I've told you. Understand? What did she tell you? I can't tell you. Not interested at all! Nothing. She... She asked me to visit lingerie factories. MADAME is into the lingerie industry? Have we signed the contract? I don't know. Finally we meet. I've heard so much about you, Madame Winnie Chang. How are you, Mr. Greenberg? Very well, thanks. Only three of you? Don't you think it's enough? You met David, Lee Xiang. We don't really need any unnecessary sit-in staff, do we? As you say. Do you know why she wants us all out? I don't know. Because we can only know what she wants us to know. We only need to know what we're supposed to know. Don't think that a proposal can make you succeed. Not till you drop! Feeling a sense of achievement? Being in the same meeting with us? No. No? You dare not say yes? - I look down upon you. - Yes. You even made me translate your proposal. You want to replace me? Chang said you reminded her of a younger me. I don't quite remember. If you want to destroy someone, give him lots of benefits... ...and then take them all away. Promotion and destruction are two sides of the same coin. Remember my words. Nice meeting you, Mr. Greenberg. The pleasure is all mine. Mr. Greenberg, it's my great pleasure doing business with you. MADAM E's future can't rely on the traditional marketplace. Bygone benefits are bygone. Facing unknown crisis, we need to attack as well as defend. MADAM E's market is threatened. Let's create a new beginning. A new beginning Ho Chung-ping isn't aware of. A brand-new independence. MADAM E's new product: Taking care of you, thinking of you. The body-Warming, heart-warming MADAME lingerie. Morning, Chairman. Morning! Lee Xiang? Have a seat. I came as soon as I received your call. Am I late? People speak highly of you, young, energetic, proactive, and sincere. It was Ms. Chang who gave me the opportunity. She told me you have lots of innovative ideas I want to hear it from you in person. You mean the heart-warming MADAME lingerie? Heart-warming rather than body-warming? Ms. Chang says women love heart-warming lingerie. I have a proposal here. I've been visiting factories and comparing prices. May I have a look? Sure. No wonder MADAME is happy. We have fewer hands in the company and need to open a newline. Are you overworking? No. The team in the company takes care of MADAM E's cosmetics As for the new product, Ms. Chang asked David and I to produce it in small quantities. Our colleagues know nothing about it. Business secret. The meeting between us is business secret, too. Don't tell anyone. Sure. Young man! I knew I could believe you from the instant I saw your eyes. Really? Thank you, Chairman! Thank you. Hello? How was the deal with MADAME? Too early to tell! What did they say? They're tough and demanding. Not necessarily a sure success. Are they? Yes! The market isn't good. There's no hurry. Right. I agree with you. OK, bye. The wind blowing from the north-southwest is invisible. I want to ask which pig is not vulnerable. The League of Lehman Brothers Victims Protests on the Street Look, the big gray wolf goes hunting. Why eat and sleep and hear only the thundering? The wind blowing from the north-southwest is inedible. I hear the big gray wolf fears thundering. It is the heart of the most brilliant pig that is in turmoil. The one who doesn't stop eating ends up in the wolf's entrails. Look, who's the storyteller that fears the wind? Look, who doubts the story after hearing the story? The wind blowing from the north-southwest is changing. The pig grows smarter after hearing the shout of a tiger. Mrs. Ho is awake! What a wonderful day. - Look, who's the one - Hello? who ends up devouring the wolf? Who can tell between predator and prey, between pig and wolf? Early Hong Kong morning, the fourth largest U.S investment bank Lehman Brothers suddenly declares bankruptcy. Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and other major Asian stock markets crashed when market opened this morning. HSI plunge 1,052 points The lowest record of the past 22 months. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Prepare defibrillator 200 joules. 200 joules ready! Charge. 200 joules, clear. 360 joules, charge. Clear. We're late. She had been awake for only 15 minutes. Ten minutes, five minutes, even one minute. I wish I could've made it. She's unwilling to let o because of us. We're family. My love toward you and Mom will never change. You always say so. I can't pretend not to hear the gossip. I can't pretend Chang isn't there. Daddy, do you love Chang? Do you know what's on her mind? What she's doing behind you? What should I know? David's always with her. The naive Lee Xiang is busy with her secret MADAME plan. Do you know it? Do you know it? There are things I don't need to know. There are things I don't want to know. If I want to know, who can stop me? I knew it. I knew you can't stand being lonely. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Is this the love we used to believe in? Imagine you passing through the crowd towards me. Should I look forward to it or fear waiting for you? Love is between "already" and "not yet," between presence and absence. You just stand in the wind imagining where I could've been. I'm looking at you looking at the distance between our gaze. I can't hear what you're hearing. Can I truly love you without really knowing you? I love "my ideal self. " Not that I don't care. I do care about what lies ahead of us. Not that I'm not willing to say I do. But I prefer to remain silent. We're not yet in a relationship but already afraid of ending it. Not that I don't worry. But I prefer to be carefree. When I'm imagining you, your eyes keep me company. When I'm looking at you, your face encounters mine. I don't really know you. I don't know if I've been in love with you for a long time. We love "our ideal selves." We love "our ideal selves" only because you love them too. I've been waiting for you for over half an hour. I missed the previous ferry. Please don't be angry. I am too busy today. Do you know how many lingerie factories I visited today? Look at the camera It's a gift from Chang. If you're busy, don't ask me out. Why didn't you call and tell me that you would be late? Let me take you to a pizza restaurant. No, I'm going home. Let me see you home. No. Why don't you let me see you home? I want to see where you live, what's your daily life like? Is your family going to like me? Lee Xiang, you've changed. Kat, I haven't. I haven't changed. I'm honest with you. I told you everything I knew. Is being honest so difficult? Isn't this the principle we've learned at home and at school? You mean I've changed? Hello? Mr. Lin. Are you out of your mind? I've looking for you in your factory and you were not there! Please show up tomorrow. I'm waiting for your bank slips. Have to submit the "Profit and Loss" of 2007. Let me see. See what? Let me see if the account is right. I broke up with Dong. I decided to break up with Dong. Is the account right? I made the decision and was sad. I really feel sad. The only thing I wanted to do is find you and tell you that I'm not marrying him. Great! - Is it great? - Yes. Is it? We're the perfect match. You're the woman of my life. I won't let you feel lonely anymore. Help me out of this crisis. Fill in the number. Change the total number. I'll find the receipts later. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? About our future! You're the only woman who cares for me. After IPO, Chang will have other plans. As soon as she leaves, I'm the one who can replace her. You'll never see me again if anything goes wrong now. Or you don't want to see me again? I'm so stupid. You've never loved me. I thought you did. OK. Do you have any idea what you're asking is illegal? It's temporary. I'll put the money back soon. What? You're taking advantage of me. Your relationship with Chang is dubious. If we're in a dubious relationship, I would just ask her to solve this. Because of you, I want to keep a distance from her. I want everyone to know I love you. Don't bite your nails. Fix it for me. I'll take full responsibility. Don't bite your nails! - Hit me... - Stop it. That's enough. If I didn't hit you, how could I see who you are? Look at me. Let's see each other clearly... We are in need of each other, Sophie. You need someone who knows you better. I won't leave you. Help me... Help me... Help us. I need your love, just as you need my devotion. Mutual love - means keeping promises - Mutual love - which are priceless. - Is a fair solution. Perhaps - only you know my heart's motion. - Only I know your heart's motion. - Let's face difficulties together - Let's strive together - and start a love revolution. - and start a love revolution. There was a time when we were attracted to dreams. When we were in the mood, we had no worries. Now, we can only rely on each other. Why don't we confide in each other until the sky's cleared up? - Deep as our friendship is, - Merciless as our world is, - we can exchange love. - we can exchange more than sympathy. - Let's sing love songs - The more we sing, - to each other. - the more music to our ears. - We're made for each other. - You have my word. We're made for each other. - We shouldn't waste the beautiful future. - We will win the beautiful future. In the remaining days, we will depend on and believe in each other. Hello? I'm sorry.

David is out. Yes, he's out. Who are you? The bank? Hello? Tell David Wang if he can't return the money by Friday, we'll o look for him in the company. Let him decide whether he wants his left or right hand. Who are you? Why the A.C. is so cold? The A.C. is centralized. Of course I know! Can't you turn it off? Idiot! Have you found Mr. Greenberg? Mr. Greenberg, anybody knows where Mr. Greenberg is? He's been missing for several days. Kar-ling! Kar-ling! Yes! Where is Mr. Greenberg? I don't know. Where did you hide him? In your skirt or underwear? Find him before you get off work today! - Lee Xiang! - Yes. - Got a cigarette? - Yes. Let's o. Quick. You've heard what she said about me. You all heard it, right? I resign now. Kar-ling! Kar-ling, calm down! - It's hard to find a job - What are you doing? - In such bad environment! - Give it back to me! - Calm down. - Give it back. I can't bear it anymore! Kar-ling! Your shoes. Chang's enemies have to leave. I'm not going to be others' obstacles. We want a better job but the outside world is ghastly. After buying all the famous brands, I find my existence not necessary. Why this tolerance if it only leads to subservience? I toil here for my future independence. for my future affluence. for my future success. for a beautiful future in the eyes of others. The up-and-coming Lee Xiang wants to replace the missing David. It's said that David owes an enormous debt. A million...just a million Can I pay you back in one week? And brought Sophie along with him. Listen, the loyal chant is charming. Listen, bonuses are music to my ears. Look, with one heart we'll build a financial empire. We're one big family. Pay you half a million first. The rest comes later. I only got half a million. You get nothing if I die! Ms. Chang, we've received the order from Mr. Ho to call off the IPO. How come? You should ask the accounting firm! I shouldn't comment on this. Why are you taking all our documents? Mr. Ho, please Sorry, Ms. Chang, Mr. Ho went abroad the other day. Where? When will he be back? Sorry, I don't know. What do you want? What's this? My resignation letter. Let me tell you, I can fire anyone, except for you! You're not firing me. I want to resign. I want to leave. Do you remember who hired you? It is Chairman Ho Chung-ping. As a CEO, I can't let you o. If you think you can come and o as you wish, maybe you're too naive! I can decide for myself. I tender the resignation only out of politeness. Tell me when you can decide for yourself. You were arranged to work here! I suggest you work hard rather than be angry with me. Think of it as a way to pay back to your Dad. Go! Everyone is looking at you. Your dad doesn't want people to know you're his daughter. You can tell everyone that I urged you to stay sincerely. And may offer you a better salary. So you decided to stay. Chang calling Sophie calling Sophie. David, where are you? Sophie. Help me transfer five million to the bank. Two more days and we'll be free. How can I have five million? Our company has called off the IPO. Use the company's money to solve this problem for me, help me. Otherwise we'll both be finished. The accountants have taken the accounts away. Where are you? You will incriminate all of us! Give me 5 million! No! 20 million has gone. David, come back! David, you must figure something out! Quick, figure something out! You must... What for? I've been betrayed by my own price. Why has my dream destroyed me before I arise? What for? Hugs and rewards? Where's my love? Contracts and promises? What are the consequences? What for?

Wait on the rooftop. We will solve the problem. I changed my personality to realize my unchangeable dream. Eventually my personality changed my sense of morality. I've built my connections and then kidnapped by them. ls the deal worth it? The borrowed desire is so magnificent that I've forgotten I'm living like shit. What for? The balloon I blow up blows up before it reaches the sky. What for? The tomorrow I've invested in tortures me before I enjoy it. David. What for? Hugs and rewards? Where's my love? Contracts and promises? What are the consequences? What for? I don't want to choose what I'm offered. What for? I didn't expect I would be dying to survive. Told you cleverness would be your undoing.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for your hard work and to clarify our company's future development. Due to the financial crisis and unstable market, the IPO has been temporarily called off. But during the process, our excellent accounting team has found out some incidents that shouldn't have happened. This is absolutely the fault The executive in charge should be held accountable. I feel regret for our colleagues who have left us and those who will be leaving. Come! Let's drink for parting. We toast for the past as well as for the future! I have an important announcement to make. The head office has struck a deal with MADAME Chairman Mr. Cohen to establish MADAME CHINA and open new lines of products besides cosmetics. The first plan is to produce heart-warming lingerie for women. I want to acknowledge Lee Xiang for coming up with such a great idea. We need more young talent. I have a habit that if I encounter new recruits, I always pay attention to their eyes. Because in their eyes, I can see energy and fire! We need younger leader to succeed in fierce competition. Let me introduce you to the new leader of Jones & Sunn and MADAME CHINA. My daughter, Kat Ho. Kat, come here. I think you are all familiar with her. She is your good colleague and my good daughter. It's not easy to get acquainted. It's not easy to work together, either. We should cherish and help each other. We don't have to feel sad if someone is leaving. Don't know if I'm getting senile. I've been feeling sentimental. I feel that we haven't had chance to say goodbye properly. We should seize the present moment and reminisce about the good old days. Nothing is better than the present moment. Carpe diem! Do YOU agree? Help me. I need you. You lied to me. I didn't mean to. - You! - You know Chang will leave because you've betrayed her. I didn't. You didn't mean it. - Winnie. - Stop it. You've taught me everything. I know what I'm supposed to do. Let me enjoy our last dance. I didn't mean it. This is not my intention. I know. We didn't mean it. Right. We didn't mean it. You win. Ms. Chang, I'd like to explain. Goodbye, Ms. Chang. Goodbye, Ms. Chang. Goodbye, Ms. Chang. Goodbye, Ms. Chang. Goodbye, Ms. Chang.
