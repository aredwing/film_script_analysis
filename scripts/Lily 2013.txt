I'm talking to you! Talking to you! That's his name! HA HA! That's not his name. HA HA! Hello, HA HA. You know, man... When you look at it, just really, really look at it... You just look at it really closely... It's just not worth it you know? It's not part of the deal. It's like you just can't really, you know...? It's like tucked away up there in a corner. Just there in a corner, you know? And I'm worried... I'm really worried. I'm really really really really REALLY worried. Don't step on a crack. It'll break your mother's back. HA HA! HA HA! HA HA! Look at me. All the abuse I've taken and I've got a beautiful head of hair! God almighty, it's a glorious day! I'm probably gonna be a doctor. And I have bloody gloves. Oh wow! And what about you, Kyle? Football player. Football player? Which one? Mark Sanchez. Oh, he plays for the Jets. That's pretty cool. Hey, you guys. I'm so sorry I'm late. Not a problem. Not a problem at all. - You guys ready? - Yeah... I'll see you tomorrow boys. Have a good night. Thank you so much. Bye. Alright guys. Let's go! Okay, so let's try it from here. This is closer. Oh! Got it? This is it. We're gonna do it this time! Okay, maybe not. We have to make at least one basket. This is shameful. - Yeahhhh! - Oh my god! - High five, dude! - That was like out of... I don't even know what just happened. Kyle come play with us! My shoelace is untied. So tie it back up! I don't know how. What do you mean? Why are you wearing these shoes? Where are your velcro shoes? If you're gonna wear shoes that have laces, then we need to learn how to tie them, right? Alright. So you're gonna take your shoelaces... You're gonna make an X, alright? Then you take this and you pull it under. And tie it. Now we make a hoop here... So you have two little ears. Now you make an X with those, and then you tuck this under... And you tie it. - You did it! - I did it! Hey, uh-uh, no way, guys. Finish your homework first and then you can play. Hello! Alright, you guys. Do your... Come sit down, do your homework, and then you can play. Gimmie... Can I have that please? Hello! Anybody home? - Where is everybody? - Daddy! I've lost everybody. There's nobody home. There used to be kids running around. I don't see anybody. Where is everybody? Oh, here are the little monsters! What have you been up to? You've been shooting people, haven't you? Yeah? Okay come on. Let's take this little one to Lily, and show her what we have for dinner tonight. Lily! Look what I brought home for dinner tonight. Look! - Okay. - Put him in the bowl! Aaron please, I just got them settled down. They need to do their homework, please. I guess you have no choice. Let's go and do homework. Lily, they've disappeared again. I have no idea where they went! Aaron, please! Alright, they need to finish their homework. Okay, okay... We're not going to win tonight. You're going to have to do your homework. So what's for dinner tonight? Fish and vegetables. - Oh no! - Oh no! - Fish and vegetables! - Fish and vegetables! Ahhhh! I'm exhausted. Have a long day? Thanks for picking the kids up today. You're welcome. Do you know Kyle can't tie his shoes? Really? His mom was supposed to show him. Well, she didn't. I'll show him tomorrow. I already showed him. I was thinking... Now that your treatment is almost over... maybe we could go away next month? Yeah, maybe. Maybe? I just feel like I really need to try finding a job right now. I'm not so sure I should leave. I'll think about it. Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Stop it... Stop... Ask her... Yes? He wants to know if you like your hair like that? - What do you think? - I think it looks funny. I think you look funny! - No I don't! - Yeah you do! C'mon guys, get ready. You're going to be late for school. Yeah, I know, it's tough. You're staying with your mom tonight. Do you have everything you need? - Yeah, we know. - Yeah, we know. - Bye, darling. - Bye. Blech! - Ohhhh, gross! - Come on... - What are you up to today? - Not much. - Not much? - Yeah. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Bye! Bye. Grab your jackets, guys. Angels and devils, everybody except for God. You know, in theory, to keep safe... Chess players are always quick to say and state the theory. But you're on shaky ground when you say theory. Lot of people become geniuses if they ride the wave. A lot of people become mentally defunct. You know what I'm saying? A mental nervous breakdown... 'Cause you have so many things hitting at you. And you're saying everything... Love, business, finance, you know what I'm saying? Travel here, do these things, studying, and what have you. So, I'm gonna know so many things, so many things are hitting at you, you don't have time to figure everything out to its fullest degree. That's why there's so much debate in the world now. A person says, "Oh no. " Her husband says, "No, it's this way. " And other people say, "No, it's this way"... A lot of marriages are breaking up because the woman says, "No, it's this one," and that's because they're not looking at everything right in theory at all. Because after a while, if you don't conquer it, you have a nervous breakdown, so many things... Hello? Hello... What's all this? I thought I'd surprise you and try and cook for you for once. Wow... that was really sweet of you. Which was started under Fidel Castro, and the opening images are Fidel and Che Guevara playing golf at the country club. - At the country club? - They have memberships. They hung out there all the time. That's how I pictured it in my head: cigars, Cuban cigars... But anyway, while they were playing golf in a terrible manner, they were looking at the landscape and Fidel said, "We are going to build here "the most important art school in the world. " I like how it's already Well, everything with Fidel was "the most important. " And within a couple of days they had commissioned somebody to find the architect, an important artist... And they started designing this art school on the golf course. So they planned these buildings, there was a huge building for dance, a building for the visual arts, a building for sculpture, - a building for music... - Oh, speaking of music! I got an awesome record today. Which I think you might just like... - What do you think about that? - Now that's a surprise! - Is that a surprise? - That's a surprise! - Oh, hey Mary! - Hey, Lily. Listen, it's about the noise up here. What the hell are you doing? Oh, I was teaching myself how to tap dance. That's really great for you, but for me, it's really noisy, I'm trying to work towards a deadline, I can't concentrate. Do you think you could kill the noise? Yeah, sure! - I really appreciate it. - Great, okay. Hey listen, how ya doin'? - I'm doin' good. - You feeling alright? Yeah, I feel good. Have you heard about this new research they're doing on nanotechnology? Is it for cancer? Like, yeah. No. You may wanna look into it. It's pretty innovative and I think it could be helpful to you. Okay. Listen... If there's anything you need... If I can help you with anything... I'm your downstairs neighbor, and I'm there for you and happy to help you in any way I can if you need it, so... Okay, that's nice... Just knock on the door, let me know. - I will. - Okay. Anyway, listen, I gotta go. But best to Aaron alright? Okay, take care! - Okay! - Bye. - Lily! - God! - Hi! - Rochelle! - How are you? - How ya doin'? I'm good. I haven't seen you in so long. I know. I haven't been out in forever. So what's been going on? What have you been up to? This, the show. Awesome, and it looks great. It's so cool. Hey, did you happen to ask them if they're hiring? I did, and there's still nothing, but as soon as something comes up, you're the first person I'm gonna let know. Okay, Lily, it looks like you are positive for the BRCA2 gene. So, we generally recommend a prophylactic mastectomy. Okay, that's not really an option. It's totally understandable. It won't prevent the other cancers from developing. But what it does mean is that we need to increase surveillance of the development of breast cancer. And the other cancers. So that you need to do a monthly self-examination, okay? You need to visit your doctor every six months, for them to examine you to look for any lumps or abnormal tissue. You'll need an annual mammogram. And you'll probably need a pelvic ultrasound to screen for ovarian cancer. - Okay. - Okay? The BRCA2 status does not mean that you are destined to develop cancers. It does increase your risk of developing a second cancer quite significantly. So what we do recommend, we want to make sure that all at risk family members are aware of their status or the possibility of their status. So we know that your mother, when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, she got the BRCA testing and she was negative? Right. So this means that you inherited the gene from your father. Okay? So we do recommend that you inform him and other family members of the possibility that they may be BRCA positive. And especially him because we know that he is positive. I don't know... My dad and I don't really talk all that much. Okay, it's totally understandable. We do offer a generic letter notifying family members of the possibility of their BRCA status. The reason why we recommend it strongly in this case is that the risk in men is also significant for developing male breast cancer. Earlier onset prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. And male breast cancer often goes undiagnosed I've been listening to that tape you gave me all the time. Yeah? You like it? Yeah, I love it, it's awesome. - It's cool, right? - Yeah. I feel like it's great. Yeah, I've been spending a lot of time at home labeling all my old tapes and trying to figure out which ones are my favorites. I don't know, I'd like to do something with them. I think they're cool. Well, guess who I ran into the other day? Who? Patrick. He asked about you. He did? Does he know...? Yeah, he does. I think that you should go see him. Yeah, but I kind of screwed him over. Yeah, you did! You're not the first artist ever to fuck up, I don't think. - I'm not? - Chances are! Other people fuck up besides me? What are you doing on Friday? - On Friday? - Yeah, at night. Night? Oh! Night time, no. I'm really busy. Seriously, there's a movie coming on I wanna watch and I bought some new jammies, I really wanna break 'em in. Dylan's having people over and I think you should come. - Aw, Dylan! - Yeah. - I haven't seen him in forever. - I know. And he loves you... He's a great guy. I was trying to get Lily to come to Dylan's party on Friday. - Yeah, you should go. - Are you going? No, but I doubt your boyfriend would have a problem with it, seeing as how he's tucked in about eight every night? John! I'm not supposed to... Don't listen to him! No, he's not that... you're not that far off, yeah. 8:30, it's a Friday night. Give him some credit. That's when "Golden Girls" is finished. - Yeah... - Okay, that's enough! - Okay I'm done! - That's enough. - Leave us alone please! - I'm will. Bye! So great to see you! I'm sorry. - Hey, no... - He has some problems. You know, I like mysteries. I don't know whether you know or not, but these guys know. I really like mysteries and this library down here on the corner... One day I was wondering, why are there so few mysteries here? I have some of my favorites: Simenon, Ruth Rendell, P.D. James, those people... And I realized, I was looking through Literature one day, those same names are showing up in Literature! Why do you have a P.D. James that was published in 1980 in Mystery, and one that was published in 1983 in Literature? It doesn't... she's the same writer. And they don't seem to know anything about it or how it got that way... Now there's a case to be made that some writers wrote better books than... Graham Greene wrote entertainments. And maybe they're a little less than some of his bigger books but... I don't think they deserve a different classification. Yeah... - Frustrating. - Yeah, yeah. I don't know, it's useless to talk to them, they don't... So congratulations are going to be in order soon. Your treatment's almost over, correct? That is correct, sir! Aaron, any big plans for this young lady when she wraps things up? We talked about maybe going away next month. What did you do, Nell when you finished your treatment? Gosh, let's see... I think that we just had a nice quiet evening at home? Neil? I don't remember. Oh Neil, I couldn't help but notice the plants in the corner of the room. Really livens this place up... That was your mother's contribution. I let her have that corner for herself. Oh wow, you got a whole corner! Your mother's very expressive. Yes, I am. I think they just really add so much life to the room. I'm thinking about putting some over in that window area. - Two, I thought... - Wow. I think this is enough for now. Well, we will see about that. Won't we? Would anyone like some more coffee? I'm good. Thank you. - I'll have some, thanks. - Okay. Be right back. Yeah? Let's see whatcha got. We were able to retrieve five eggs during the procedure. As I explained last time, we like to get 15 eggs, but five viable eggs is great. Okay? And they will stay frozen until such time that you are ready to have children at some point in the future. But that's assuming I can have kids? Well, that's a fair question. When a young woman is forced into an early menopause, she can regain her cycle, and yet, still not be able to conceive. Now. You on the other hand, have done all the right things. You've taken the right steps to ensure that, should you be able to have children in the future, you have eggs in storage that can be fertilized. And Lily, that's a good thing. - Lily! Lily! - Woah! Hey, what are you guys doing here? Our mom dropped us off. Oh yeah? What happened? Yeah, Andrea had an emergency. She asked me if I could take care of them. Oh, okay. Sit down, kids. Come on, dinner's ready. Hi, is this Sharon? Hi. Sharon, my name is Lily Graham, I'm trying to make a payment on my account. Right. I'm calling to try and out what the lowest payment I could make every month is... I just need to set up a payment plan or something? Yeah but you guys have put me on hold a lot already today, so can we just... Okay, but I just really don't wanna go on hold... You know what? I just have to call you back. I told you I'd take care of it for you. I know, we had this conversation already and I don't want you to. - Okay... - Thank you. Suit yourself. So, I invited a few friends over for dinner. Who? Mary, Drew, Laura, Casey... Aaron! And who's gonna cook for them? I thought maybe you could cook for them? Yeah? - You love cooking. - Oh I love cooking? I feel like I never have anything to say to your friends. Just jump into the conversation. - Just like that? - Just like that. So I went to Macy's this morning and found the most beautiful burgundy sweater. Oh, I love burgundy on you. Yeah, well good! Because I put it on hold and I'll probably pick it up tomorrow. Why would you put it on hold? Oh, just to run it by Neil. You know... So, honey, you never called to tell me what the doctor had to say. Oh yeah... Turns out that I do have a genetic mutation, so... Sorry. Yeah, it just means that now the odds of me getting ovarian cancer go up, and there's a possibility that it might come back in my other breast. Yes, that's true, but it's not a definite Lily. Just 'cause you're carrying the gene doesn't mean you're going to get breast cancer again honey. I know, Mom. That's exactly what I said. It just means that the odds are greater and I have to be careful. I just don't think it does any good to sit around and focus on it "maybe" coming back. I'm not focusing on it. I didn't even say I was thinking about it. I was just telling you what the counselor told me. Fine. I'd really enjoy a glass of wine. May I have one please? So, what are you fixing for dinner? Pasta. Woah! Honey, do you always use that much olive oil? That's an awful lot. It's fine, Mom. You know they said I should probably tell Dad about the results. Oh. So what are you gonna do? Well, I was thinking about telling him. I don't think that's a good idea, honey. You don't think it's ridiculous that I have a father that doesn't even know I have breast cancer? Of course I do. But you know your father, Lily. He's emotionally unavailable. And that's why I married Neil. But... you do what you want. You'll figure it out. Oh, honey... If you cut the tomato the other way around, it's so much easier. It's fine, Mom. Here... Let me show you how. - See, it's so much easier. - Mom, it's fine. I know, but the pieces are so much nicer and there are no seeds. Mom, it's fine, I got it. Seriously, Mom, it's fine! Alright. I was just trying to be helpful. You know what? I think I'll have a glass of wine too. But I thought you weren't supposed to drink. Well, in that case, I'll have another one myself. Cheers! To your health, darling. Cheers. Hi Nell! What are you doing here? Aaron, bon soir. - So nice to see you! - Lovely to see you too. You're having a drink? That's what I said. Well you can't travel... If you go up to Vermont, you just drive... You're investing in Harlem, is that correct? I did, yeah. How many buildings did you buy? - Put 'em in your pocket... - Four or five buildings... Accumulations... Days... to one's life, to the beginning... A fruit or flower developing and then there's a moment where it starts to die... With the harvest coming, I would imagine you're... Capturing the summit of... whatever life is. The essence! The essence of whatever something is, like, in his case, it's a body... Captured something... A young virgin. He killed her... No, but I refuse to take the subway anymore. It's a shithole. It's terrible. - Trust me... - I have little children... Shows you how much time you have left... Yeah but it's funny because I have little children... My kids... it's 12, 11, 10, 9! And we're counting and we're running! - And it's kind of a game! - ... another 6 seconds... They tell you the next one's in five minutes. - Oh yeah, of course... - Sorry, my bad. I'm trying to figure out if they did it for the other... I was invited... my friend was doing a production at the... he has a gallery in the Maison de Moliere in the bottom. And he asked an actor from Ariane Mnouchkine's team to come and direct this piece about Molire, and then... I actually read about that. Very interesting. - Did you see the film? - I did, I did. And they were all running up the stairs and, anyway... So he invited me to come and I stayed there, and he had a loft, and above his bed, it said "LOVE". Wow! Anyway, and I was very, very happy... It was in the summer months, of course, and I rode my bike often from the Maison de Molire to the Marais to get my tea, or my cheese, or whatever. - Yeah, very cute. - That's so cute! I was really happy, and I felt like... I don't know I felt like Paris was... might be supporting this moment? And that I felt like my body was in tune with Paris... that the architecture fit... How to say that? I know that sounds stupid. It does! - It does sound so stupid! - But love is kind of crazy. But you know, it was a very good beautiful moment in my life and I sometimes replay it. I mean, I don't know if he knew that I was in love with him. How could you not know? Does one ever know? Does one ever know? Anyway... And so then what happened? Well, then a couple of years later, time passed, I left, I came back to New York. And then... I was invited to this castle, everybody in Paris has a castle. Everybody in Paris has a castle! - No, it's true! - No, it is true! I've got a castle! I do! Aaron's got a castle. Mary's got a castle! Mary's got an apartment in New York and a castle! Yeah, it's great... yeah it's true... I fell in love in Paris. The architecture fit my body... Why is that funny to you? Because! "The architecture fit my body!" That makes complete sense to me. I mean you've been to Paris, haven't you? - You have to go. - Seriously? Maybe because you're married I shouldn't bring it up... Hello! I'm sorry? Are you just gonna light up a cigarette without asking if anyone's offended or anything? Oh, I'm sorry, does that bother you? The smoke? No! It doesn't bother me if you smoke! No that's great, be comfortable! Make yourself at home! I'm gonna get comfortable too! I'm gonna get comfortable too! - Lily! - It's great! We're all comfortable now! Everybody kick back and relax. This is great. Kick off your shoes. Have a good time! I think that we should get going. You guys don't have to go. Thank you. We'll do this again another time. - Alright... - Bye, Lily. - See ya, Mary. - Thank you... See you around! I'm so sorry, Lily, I apologize. Thank you... That's a real fun night. Yeah? Ahhhh... I made an ass out of myself last night. Is Aaron upset? I don't know if he's upset so much as disappointed. You know, I embarrassed him in front of his friends. What do you think's going on? I mean, are you okay? Not really. I feel like I should be cause everybody's so happy for me right now. They keep congratulating me that treatments almost over, but I don't feel happy about it. I mean I feel like treatment was kind of the easy part. God, I gotta find a job. I have to start making money. I have to think about if I ever want kids. - Aaron's just getting older! - Okay... I've got eggs stored in a freezer! - I'm hungover! - Okay, that's a lot of stuff! You can't figure all that out at once. That would make me feel crazy too. It'd make anyone feel crazy. Just pick one thing to start with. Did you go and see Patrick yet? No... - Well... - No, no... Well that's one thing that you can do. It's not easy, but you do that one thing, and then that leads to the next thing... Before you know it... you're doin' things. Hi... So they wanted me to go in and fill out papers, I'm not filling out any papers... I just found that kitten in the street just now. It might be yours. It was only a few blocks away from the ASPCA. But they wanted me to go in and then file some papers... File some papers? Get the hell outta here! What? Are they outta their minds? I was thinking about keeping it and taking it to you... What color was it? It had like a tiger stripe, but brown and black. It was a cute kitten, man. Lemme call you back, alright? - Lemme call you back. - I'll talk to you. Hi, I was wondering if Patrick is here? Patrick. Oh, Lily. - Hey! - Hey! - How are you? - Good. How's it goin'? - Good, good. C'mon back. - Okay, thanks. - Nice to see you. - Good to see you too. I actually saw Emily the other day and asked about you. I know! She told me you guys ran into each other. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, come on back. Have a seat please. Thank you. Thank you. Wow! That's really nice! Yeah, so that's the same artist that's out front: Jessica Dickenson. And this work was actually done entirely on the back. So what you're seeing is basically what's bleeding through the surface. That's so cool. She's really doing well in galleries. Thankfully doing well, so... What brings you here? I guess I just wanna know... Are you hiring here? Or do you need help in the gallery? Or an assistant? A job for you? Yeah. Are you still making work? I am actually. I've been working a lot lately. Yeah. Well, I just... Hope you can understand it's kinda awkward that you'd be asking me for a job. I understand that you need to make ends meet and stuff, but I just feel like it's such a misuse of your talent to be working some administrative job here. I feel like I'd be doing you a favor, actually, if I didn't offer you a job. And, I hope you can understand, you know? Hey! Chill out dude! What the fuck is your problem? Where are you going? You scared the shit out of me! - Fuck off, lady! - You fuck off! Good for you! Asshole! You're stuck in traffic now, you look stupid. You believe this? Well, you see on Broadway... This fucking crazy guy honking his horn like a nut! You should go see how they block off. Every day they blockoff. It's fucking crazy! Yeah, you're right! Everybody's crazy! Yeah! Well, I got this asshole honking at me! And now he's stuck in traffic! Schmuck! God! - Hey! - Oh, Lily! - Dylan! - Lily! Oh my God! I can't believe you're here! You made it. You made it. It's so great to see you, it's so great to see you. - It's good to see you too! - How you doing? Good? - Alright. - Awesome. Do you want a drink? - Water? - Water? - Yeah water. - Is that what you drink now? - That's my thing! - Water's my thing too! Water or I drink olive oil too, but tonight I'm drinking water. So I'll join you in the water. Have you seen Emily? Because I don't like to leave the house and so I invite them. But I don't even want to see them! They just come here! And then you come in here! No, then I take what I call "the chosen ones"... Oh wow! And then I invite them into my realm. - But I've always been like... - Private party...? I've always been like this, even when I was a kid. I would lock the door and my parents would bang on the door, and they would try and get in and I'd say, "You can't come in, this is my sacred place!" Finally they'd say, "We don't care about your sacred place, you're grounded! They tried way too hard and they could never get it right. And as a result, we're not even that close. But you must be close to your parents My dad, I haven't even talked to him in years so I feel like... Even now? Like with all this stuff? No! We haven't talked in years. Years! I know but this is like... You can't... Lily, this is some real shit, you know? I know, but what do, you just call somebody you haven't talked to in so long and say, "Oh hey, it's been awhile. I have cancer. " - You haven't called him? - No. You should call him for money! I mean how are you gonna pay your bills? How can you not tell your dad? I've been thinking about telling him cause I feel like it's kind of ridiculous... It is kind of ridiculous that you haven't told him. I know, but... And not to mention it's kind of ridiculous that you continue to wear that wig. Is it ridiculous? Kind of! I know "this" is ridiculous and doesn't look like my hair. No it doesn't. - But it's so... - You. Different from what you guys, no! My hair underneath! So she has hair underneath the wig? Because when you get radiation, it starts to grow back. It's when you're on chemo that it falls out and it's not growing. - Are you a magician...? - Is it anything like this? It can't be worse than this, right? Look! And this is genetic. I didn't have to go to the hospital to get this to happen. - Will you just take it off? - It looks really cute. - Come on. - We should just see it. - It looks sweet. - Take it off... She's gonna do it! She's gonna do it! - Oh my God! - This is so embarrassing! I'm not watching you intently. Yes, I am. Woah! - Look at you! - That looks amazing. - It's so short! - So what? It looks incredible! It used to be so long. But it's not, it used to be so long though! I've been hiding it while it grows back in. I don't have a problem... Look if it makes you feel better, I'll go out like this. You have to go out like that! - Okay. - Oh my god! It looks way better on you! I can't believe that you wear this wig. I'm just not... Never again. Never again. This is so much... You're beautiful. You need to continue wearing that wig, I'm can say that. That looks amazing on you. - That is... - This wig... - Seriously! - I have to say... I love it on him, are you kidding me! Put it back on! Someone is getting laid tonight. Lemme tell you. - On the safe bed... - It could be the wig. In the safety zone! I'm gonna fuck this wig. Oh, you're laughing at that, right? Yeah, I think that's the happiness of it. That's the being alive of it. Being born again every day... Well, you're constantly being born and dying, and born, and dying, and born, and dying and born... I feel like once you lose that way of looking at the world, when you lose that sense of wonderment about the things around you, what do you have left? Well, you've got... You've got stocks, you've got bonds, you got shoes, you got... And you need more and more of it. You know, you ain't got nothin', but you got a lot of shit. Dad! Jeff! Hi... Lily. Hey. How are you? I'm good, how are you? Well, thanks. Good to see you. Thank you. Oh... I made this for you. - You made this? - Yeah. It's not bad. You cut your hair, I almost didn't recognize you. I think you look better with longer hair. Thanks. So it's been awhile. Yeah. It's been three years. Well, you haven't called me. Well, you could try calling me too. Works both ways... When I didn't hear from you, I just assumed you didn't have anything to say. So that's it? Three years and you don't have anything else to say to me? What do you want me to say, Lily? I don't know. How about: "How's your life been? "What's been going on? What have you been up to? "I really wonder what my only child has been up to?" Look, I have a lot of stuff I need to do today. Oh, okay. Was there something you wanted? Why did you come to see me? I came to see you because you're my dad. I'll show myself out. Great seeing you. I'm glad you're well. Thanks. - Hello! - Hi! So? Done! Yeah. And how do you feel about it? I don't know yet... I'm not sure. Lemme take one last look at the radiation burn. I hope we didn't damage you too badly. I don't think you did. I was using the aloe the whole time so... - Okay. - I feel like it did okay. It looks pretty good. Mild erythema but no pustules. That's good. Good. It's gonna heal on its own pretty much, but it's healing well. - Yeah? - Yep. You're young... Well, are your big plans now? I guess just take it one day at a time. Smart answer. So we're going to see you in about six months... Okay. You're gonna go to the front desk and make an appointment. - You'll be well. - Thank you. - See you. - Thanks. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - How much is it again? - Eleven fifty. - Bonjour! - Salut! - How was your day? - Great. - You must be happy it's over. - Yeah. I'll just take my jacket off, I'll be right back. I know you don't want to celebrate, but I thought maybe we could go out for dinner tomorrow? Maybe grab some sushi? Yeah, maybe. I got some good news. I was offered a job for two weeks in Paris next month. It's actually great because I thought we could make it coincide with the trip we were planning. Have you thought more about our trip? Lily, have you thought more about our trip? Lily? - Lily, hey, you're back. - Yeah. I don't have too much time, I have some people in the back. Can I just steal you for a second? Sure. The other day I came in here, I asked you for a job, I have no idea what I was thinking. That's not what I wanted to ask you. I wanted to know if you would come by and take at look at what I've been working on. I don't know, Lily, you know... I know I fucked up. And I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I just want you to come by and take a look. That's it, just take a look at what I've been working on. Alright well, why don't you give me a ring tomorrow and we'll see if we can schedule something for next week. Yeah? Yeah, let's give it a try. - Okay, so, next week? - Next week. Yay! Thank you Patrick! Thank you! Mistral Artist
