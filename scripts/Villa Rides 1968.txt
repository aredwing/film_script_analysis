ONE OF THESE DAYS, THAT MAN'S GONNA OWN THIS COUNTRY. HE DOESN'T WAN TO OWN THE COUNTRY. HE DOESN'T? NO. HE WANTS THE PEOPLE TO OWN IT.

PANCHO, PLEASE DON' MISUNDERSTAND ME. I'M HAPPY YOU'RE HERE, VERY HAPPY, BUT... YOU HAVE JUST CREATED A TERRIBLE PROBLEM. OH? YOU DON' WANT PARRAL? OF COURSE I DO. E, BUT WHEN HUERTA FINDS OU THAT YOU'VE COME DIRECTLY TO M HE WILL THINK THAT YOU AND I ARE PLOTTING BEHIND HIS BACK... AND THAT'S DANGEROUS. WHO THE HELL IS HUERTA, ANYWAY? DID HE WIN PARRAL? NO! HE'S NO GOOD. HE DRINKS. HE'S NOT FOR YOU, JUST FOR HIMSELF. DON'T PUT ME UNDER HIS COMMAND. GENERAL HUERTA IS HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN ARMY. WHAT ELSE COULD I DO? I GAVE HIM MY WORD. WHAT ABOU YOUR WORD TO ME? DON'T YOU OWE ME SOMETHING? I TOOK PARRAL FOR YOU, NOT HUERTA. NO NATION CAN HAVE 2 ARMIES. UNDER HUERTA, ONE ARMY IS ONE TOO MANY. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE AGAINST HUERTA? I DON'T THINK HE'S LOYAL TO YOU. YOU PERSONALLY KNOW THAT GENERAL HUERTA PLANS TO OVERTHROW THE REVOLUTION? NO, MY PRESIDENT. HAS ANYONE INDICATED TO YOU, EVEN BY RUMOR, THAT HE HAS SUCH PLANS? NO, MY PRESIDENT. THEN WHAT? COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. SPEAK UP. GET OUT OF HERE. GET BACK TO YOUR PEOPLE. FACTS. I WANT FACTS. GET OU OF THIS FANCY PALACE. GIVE ME PROOF. I CANNOT GIVE YOU PROOF, BUT I KNOW. I CAN SMELL IT. I KNOW! PANCHO, DO YOU THINK THAT... THAT I AM BETRAYING THE REVOLUTION? NO, BUT... HOW CAN YOU TRUST HUERTA AND NOT ME? YOU'RE MY PRESIDENT. I ASK YOU ONLY ONE THING: DON'T TRUST HIM. EVERYONE IS NOT LIKE YOU. MY FRIEND, IT'S VERY MUCH BETTER THAT I DIE A FOOL, TRUSTING TOO MUCH, THAN LIVE A TYRANT, TRUSTING NO ONE AT ALL. MEXICO'S HAD ENOUGH OF THOSE. OH, PANCHO, THIS IS JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS. ONCE AGAIN, I'M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP. IT'S ESSENTIAL TO ME TO HAVE YOUR PROMISE THAT YOU'LL OBEY GENERAL HUERTA AS YOU OBEY ME. YOU'RE TOO GOOD. THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE. HAVE I YOUR PROMISE? YES, MY PRESIDENT. I PROMISE. AND SO, GENTLEMEN, TOMORROW AT FIRST LIGHT, WE WILL INITIATE OUR ATTACK ON CONEJOS. YOU, COLONEL VILLA, WILL HAVE THE HONOR OF LEADING YOUR FORCES ON THE PRIMARY ASSAULT.
