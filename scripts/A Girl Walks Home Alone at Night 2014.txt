Do you know how many days I worked to buy this car? - Whose cat is that? - It's mine. 2,191 days. Dearest ladies with families... you care for your households, you care for your children, your husbands. And your husband brings home the money. Congratulations. But be prepared. One day, everything changes. Your husband leaves you, finds himself a new wife. A different woman, a younger woman. Or perhaps. Your husband has a stroke and dies. These things happen. What's with you? Open the door. Don't count the things you've lost. Let's count what's still left. Look, Hossein, I help you, don't I? I give, you take. Does that seem right to you? I swear to God... on my mother's grave, I'll pay you. Are you a junkie? Answer me. I'm sick, I'm sick. You're a junkie. Your promises mean nothing. Who made him a junkie? What's your cat's name? Is it a boy or girl? Mr. Cat! Mr. Cat! He's really fun. He's really fun. Look, your father is a normal man. Gambler, enjoys women. Takes medicine for his pain. You see? Completely normal. All right? However, the things your father likes, he can't afford. Right? No. It's my car, not his. Do you even realize how much your father owes me? I gave you money last week. Business is business. Hello? Come up here. I need you. I want to get really wasted. We'll tell Omid to drive. I don't get it. Why do they keep having costume parties? Seriously. So what are you going to wear? Excuse me, Miss Shaydah? I'm sorry, Miss Shaydah? Sorry to bother you, but this is going to take some time to fix. Go ahead. Then do you mind leaving me alone in here to work on this? What for? Your mother and father. I'll call you right back. My mother and father? What if they knew you were alone with a boy in your bedroom? - Are you serious? - It's inappropriate. What a gentleman. My knees are weak. See my car? Well, get in. - How old are you now, Atti? - Give me my cut. Take it easy. Come on, how old are you? - Thirty. - Thirty. You're getting old. Don't you want kids? Women want kids, don't they? Get out. - I want my cut. - You're light. - Give me my cut. - Get out. - I'm not light. - You think I'm joking? Get out! Get out of here! Next time you focus on your job. Understand? And quit your crying. Hag! Now what? Come on. Want a line? Leave a message, hooker. It's Arash, I'm outside. I've got something for you. Look, I want my car. I should die and leave you in peace. Here, drink some water first. You know what would hit the spot? Driving in a convertible. What fun we'd have. For God's sake, let's talk for a minute. You don't talk to me. You don't look at me. How much have I given you? Should I add it up? What do you want, Hossein? Let's talk a little, be close to each other. When you find some money, come find me. All right? Blind cat. Are you a good boy? Answer me. Are you a good boy or not? Yes. Don't lie. Are you a good boy? Yes. I'll ask you one more time. Tell the truth. Are you a good boy? I can take your eyes out of your skull and give them to dogs to eat. Till the end of your life, I'll be watching you. Understand? Yes. Be a good boy. Dad... I brought you soup. What do I want soup for? Don't you see me? Do you see me here? Where's your loyalty? I'm sick. Sick! I need my medicine! His father is lying here like this, and he's only thinking of himself. Arash, look at you. This is Shirin. Hey. Listen, we heard you have X. Our friend told us to find Dracula. It's on me. Really? To your health. Your costume is really fun. - Are you scared? - Very scared. And you? Are you scared? So this is your new job? - Give me another one. - One is enough. - Give it. - One is enough. Open your mouth. Are you scared? This pill is nothing without you. It needs you. Arash! Look how chic he is now. Arash, are you okay? Arash? Arash? I'm lost. Where are we? Bad City. Bad City? I live in Bad City. This doesn't look like Bad City. Does it? It's not familiar. I'm Dracula. Don't worry, I won't hurt you. Can I ask you something? Why are you here? Both of us - Both of us are here. I've never felt like this before. Give me your hand. You're so cold. Let's sit. You can't sit here. My house is near here. You can sit there. I can't, I have to sit. What's with you? You look funny. I'm tired. Yes, I can see that. Where were you in the middle of the night? With a girl. What girl? I don't know her name. You don't know her name. Who's her family? I don't know. I don't know, I don't know." Are you an idiot now? Have you become an idiot? Yep, he's an idiot. Congratulations, handsome. Why are you following me? What do you want? Where did you get this? Girl, where did you get this? Have one. They're sweet. What are you following me around for? Are you religious or something? No. Look who found her tongue. You want to do what I do? It's not easy. If that's why you're following me around, I'm not a teacher. You don't like what you do. You're watching me? At night. So... what did you see all this time watching me? You're sad. You don't remember what you want. You don't remember wanting. It passed long ago. And nothing ever changes. Idiots and rich people are the only ones who think things can change. You're saving your money. For what? Are you a thief? No. So what are you? MEET ME AT THE POWER PLAN TOMORROW AT 10:00 P.M. - DRACULA Are you hungry? I brought you a hamburger. You don't like hamburgers? I never met someone who didn't like hamburgers. I don't know your name. You don't know me. Obviously. We just met. What was the last song you listened to? Hello, " Hello." Lionel Richie. Sad. Sad songs hit the spot, don't they? I know something else about you. Your ears aren't pierced. They're pretty. They're for you. Too bad you can't wear them. Seriously? Are you sure? Did it hurt? - You don't have to. - Do the other one. - Forget it. - Do it. It's done. What lucky earrings. I've done bad things. I'm bad. Obviously. You don't know the things I've done. And you don't know the things I've done. If there was a storm coming right now, a big storm, from behind those mountains, would it matter? Would it change anything? Did you come here to watch me? Are you watching me? What do you want? What? What? What do you want? You're still torturing me? You left me here alone. Now you're back again. What the hell do you want from me? Leave me alone! You ruined me! This is the life you left me! Leave me alone! What the hell do you want from me? What are you doing? Come here, look. Look at its eyes. It's your mother. - Have you lost your mind? - Do you see its eyes? It's your mother. Look, look. Look at this place. Why do you do this? Can you tell me? How much of this am I supposed to take? - What do you want me to do? - You're supposed to be my father! I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. I don't know what I'm doing anymore! You want your medicine? Here. Take it and get out of this house. Take it and leave this house, and don't come back. Take the cat with you. I don't want it anymore. I want you to dance for me... like the old days. I want - I want to watch you. Atti, sweetheart... come here. Let's be together. Sit right here. Let's have a good time. No, I don't want to. I said I don't want to, Hossein. I don't want to. Atti, sit down. I said, Sit down." We're going to have a good time. I said, I don't want to." Do you hear me? Let's have a good time. Do you hear me, Hossein? We're going to have a good time together. Let's go. You have to leave. Take that thing with you. Boy, if you saw something, you have to tell me. Understand? - Did you see something? - No. Did you see someone? No. Did you see someone? - Who was it? - I don't know. Who was it? What do you mean, you don't know? Who was it? I don't know. We have to go. Pack your things. Do you have a bag? Look, I can't stay here. We'll get in my car and go. Let's leave Bad City. Come with me. Don't leave me. Don't leave me alone.
