It's good that there's a mountain in the NE direction. Can you see that? That's the one. Good? What do you think? It's ok. Mr. Zhou. Yes, Mr. Ye? I will buy this house. In fact, the price is pretty good. You can't buy a small unit in downtown with that price. Well. If you want, everything in this house could be yours, ok? I want to renovate myself. Ok. The previous owner has left something. Let me. Thanks... Thanks. I wanna keep the doll. Mrs. Ye, you really have taste. Thanks. You are welcome. Hao and I have our own house finally.

She's quite demanding. I'm afraid I will be busy and I won't have time to take care of you. Maybe get Qing here to stay with you, ok? She's a superstar... Is she pretty in real life?

You scare the hell out of them. I don't want a boyfriend. Boyfriend would only take advantage of you. I belong to myself and no one can take away my bike. Sister. Are you really happy? Of course! Why did you ask that? The old man outside told me to get you moved. Don't you feel weird? Your brother-in-law said that's nonsense. He's nuts, don't bother. Where did you get this? The previous owner left this. Do you like it? You can have it. I don't want it, it's weird. Mike The 3rd bar should be G sharp minor. Wait. The guitar is not tuned right. Fix it. Try again.

Is Mr. Ye Hao here? Sorry, he's not here. Isn't he working on an album? He's staying with Ying Lan at the club house. What are you doing? I want you to know what the feeling of being an intruder is. Honey. This is Ying Lan, my wife Why are you here? You don't remember. You promised to arrange an interview with Miss Ying for me. You did say that though. Yeah. Can we do the interview now? Ok. Miss Ying. What do you think about the relationship between a singer and a song? That depends which song it is. Like "The Intruder? That song is from heaven. A singer can only bring music from heaven to the human world. Composer is the crucial one. What do you think about the relationship between a singer and a composer? They have to be attached to each other. Have you ever met such a composer? I think I've got one. Do you consider yourself a success? I am doing great in my work. But when ii comes to love I'm a failure. Have you considered marriage and having children? I haven't met the right guy. What if you have? I will fight for good music and song, as well as a good boyfriend. What if he's married? I don't mind that. What if his wife does mind though? That would be his choice. Have you ever been in such a situation? No, and I don't hope to be. What about now? I don't know. Dunno? In fact... anything is possible, right? Dunno. Honey. Let me explain. Anything is possible. I haven't met my right guy. She said she's helping me to find the feeling. Feeling? Go to hell! Feeling? You go to hell! You go to hell! Stop that. You dare? Put it down! Let's talk it out. There's nothing to talk about. Stop working with her and stop seeing her. This is my profession. You don't want me to work with her? Yes. No... I...don't know. In fact, besides work, no more contact with her. Can you do that? Don't you trust me? Sister-in-law. Sorry. Got you and your wife into a misunderstanding. You have nothing to do with this. Go back. And explain to her. She won't listen. Lei her calm down for a while. Ye Hao, I am telling you. "The Intruder" will be popular. Don't give up so easily. Why are you so confident? I am confident in you. In fact, success... is not easy to get. Only if you take tricky challenge, then you will have the chance to succeed. And 99% of success is from flesh and blood. While 1% is from inspiration. No wonder you are so successful. "The Intruder" is a big risk, you will be under much pressure. You ready to take up the challenge? I'm ready. Then we should work in unison and push aside all obstacles. Anything is possible. Are you ok? Sister. Qing. How is it? Abdominal pain. I will look for brother-in-law. Qing. Why are you here? I came to apologize to Tian Qing. You can't go in. Breathe deeply... Come on, don't panic... - Honey... - Push... lam here... Push... Don't be afraid... It's coming... Baby's head is coming out. Hold up!.... Push... You will have much to write... Push! For your fans to read. Right? 1! 2! Push! If you write it like this... it will take a long time... Catch it. The second one... Adam is out. - And Jimmy coming. - Push... Keep going! Honey, look. Hubby! Honey... Honey... Mr. Ye, don't worry. Your wife will be fine. She's overstressed. And she's too nervous. Mr. Ye. I am so sorry. We have done our best to save your wife and your elder son. Sorry. Tian Qing. Don't be too sad. I am really sorry about this. Don't say that. I should thank you though. Thank me? For coming to see me. I have 2 kids now. One is called Adam and the other one is called Jimmy. My hubby named them. Are they nice names? Yes. I told you to move, now only one child is left for not moving out. - Adam - Adam Adam, Adam He's tired. Let him sleep. Ok, go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go on sleeping, Adam. Honey. Are you ok? Honey. Jimmy Look how smart Jimmy is. Adam Adam, be good. Don't move. Jimmy sleeps with Adam, ok? Jimmy? Yes, Jimmy. You don't like Jimmy? Of course, I like Jimmy. Come. Jimmy sleeps with Adam Come on, put him here. Be gentle, don't be so rough on Jimmy. My wife thinks she's given birth to twins. She calls our baby Adam, while she calls the doll Jimmy. Is she suffering from mental illness? Her symptom is called Postpartum Depression or Baby Blues. During the month after giving birth, women will experience a drastic physical and psychological change, because her hormone hasn't returned to the normal level. Also, as a new mother, she will start worrying about many things. So, she will become very anxious. It'll be hard to get accustomed to it within a short time. It is a complicated situation for your wife, She expected twins before she produced, in fact she produced only one baby at the end. Therefore, in her mind and her illusion, The memory of twins lives on with her. Don't worry. It's just temporary. She will get back to the normal after treatment. In fact, some guys will suffer from Postpartum Depression too. What will it be? The same, you will have many illusions. Adam, be good. Adam's eyes are so dry. I will give you some eyedrops. Be good, don't move. Don't move. Jimmy's eyes are so dry too. Eyeddrops. What are you doing? Why are you so late? With the singer again? I went out to buy something. Buying things so late in the night? Who would believe that? Today is your sister's birthday, don't you remember? Watch out, be nice to my sister. Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Blow the candles. Baby, go to sleep. Be good. Adam will take care of Jimmy. Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday... - Who are you? - ...to you. Who the hell are you? I am your son who got killed by you. What's up? Nightmare? Why is baby here? Jimmy and Adam want me to sleep with them. Go to sleep. Sister. I am going out to buy something for the baby. Jimmy!

One of us should stay hereto take care of her. What are you guys talking about? Arguing? No. We thought you were sleeping so we didn't wake you up. Qing is about to go out.

About the same year will be fine. You don't mind I'm recording it? That's ok. Who is it? My boss. Jimmy This is house is prodigious. Those who moved in Look for a special feeling. Special feeling? What is it? Feeling of death. Your previous owners are brothers. As they moved in, they were having A game of death. There were 8 people in the game. One of the girl played the judge. While the others played the roles as killer, cops or civilians. The game is now starting. Close your eyes Eyes open for the killer. Killer will start to kill. His acting is good. Very nice. Get up. Stop pretending. The house owner played the killer. He killed the other owner though. That's his younger brother. Brother... He didn't mean to kill his brother. It's an accident. But this game is too exciting. The younger brother died of heart attack. His elder brother felt so guilty. So he sold the house and emigrated to another country. I forgot to tell you. They were twin brothers. Who are you talking to on the phone? Honey. Come here, What is it? I have something to talk to you. What is it? It's about our kids. Our kids are fine. What are you hiding from me? Nothing. I won't get jealous on Jimmy anymore. I will love him more. Is sister sleeping? Mr. Ye. Mr. Zhou. I want to know who the first owner of this house is. I have to check the record first. I want to see him, please arrange it for me. - Please. - Ok, I will try my best, ok? Thanks. What are we gonna do now? Hao. Where are you? At home. Ying Lan. Wants you to come to the studio to record "The Intruder". Ying Lan is waiting for you. Come over quickly. I have to go to the studio. Ok. I promise My next song will be yours. Thanks, hubby. Ok, honey. I gotta go. Take care of your sister. Sorry, I am late. You are the soul of this song. I can't do the recording without you. Coz' I am attached to you. Sorry. Let's start. Once upon a time. In the forest, a jackal and a monster claimed that they are the king of horror. One day, they compete... to see who can kill that mighty granny then the one will be the king of horror. Sister. Why are you telling such a horrible story? You should tell them fairy tales. In the Frog Prince, the prince got killed by the witch. What about Alice in wonderland? The evil queen ordered the executioner to chop off her head. Peter Pan? Captain Hook kept hunting him down. Excuse me, Mr. Ye please. He's not home, he's in the studio. I am Sheng. I found the first owner that you are looking for. But the owner's flying tomorrow. Do you have time to see the owner now? Ok, I coming now. I will let the owner know. Jimmy! Jimmy! What is it? Not feeling well? Sit here. Sit here. Be good. You wanna know my sister's... Love story of Yang Chun? Since my mum introduced "Affair" to me, I love reading her novels. What do you wanna know? She vanished and stopped publishing. Is it because... she's fed up with writing love story and she needs to get some other inspiration? In fact... it's all about this novel. It's about... a story which happened in a strange house. Since my sister moved in to that house, she's writing a love story. Unfortunately... her love life had a problem. Thanks for your gift. It's funny. I like this doll very much. The dull will inspire me to write a new story. Think What title should I give my next novel? Baby. Should Cupid be the name of this novel? Why didn't you call me? You have another woman? Do you have another woman? "Love and Hate Why are you calling so late in the night? Are you trying to say that we are over? You want to break up? Ok. It's been 7 years already. Let's break up then. Good luck. Many people thought that she committed suicide. But I don't think so. I think there's a strange power which took away her life. We are twins. We do think alike very often. In fact, what we have been chasing for is just peripheral. And we can't bring what we chase after when we die. Qiu, come and play ball. Coming. Do you have that novel? It's picture is here. "I miss you" ok? Ok. How's that? The first owner... committed suicide? Because of that doll? That dull is really evil. You go back and take care of your sister I will be right back after recording this song. And throw the doll away. Hubby and Jimmy... only one of them can survive. Adam, be good! Adam, be good! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Ying Lan. You finish the recording on your own. Where are you going? Let's carry on. Honey... Don't be scared... Don't be scared... l am here... Don't be scared... Die! Don't hurt Jimmy. Give it back to me. Put down your knife. You hate him so much and you want to kill him. You want Jimmy? Here. Right here. Stab right here. Do it! Jimmy is mine, give him back to me. Give Jimmy back to me. Give Jimmy back to me. Give me back. Be calm... Honey... Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy... Honey... Jimmy! Hubby... Hubby... Don't die, hubby... Wake up! Hubby... Wake up... Hubby... Hubby... - Where's Jimmy? - Hubby... Hubby... Honey, are you ok? Hubby... ls Jimmy dead? Jimmy at is dead at birth. Honey... Honey... It's ok... I don't know what I am doing. It's ok... Hubby... It's ok... What happened? Are you ok? I am ok. Really? Yes. Adam Where's the doll? I burnt it. I told you to move out long ago. You are moving out now. Take care. Ok. We are moving, it's a new start. My baby blues is getting better. It's lucky that... we have our own baby. I think all mishap is over. It's nice to see water in the SW direction. Hi, Mr. Ye. Mr. Chen. Come here, Mr. Chen. It's as big as a football field here, it's the parking lot actually. Ok, it's nice for my baby. Many things happened lately. Sister is suffering from baby blues. In fact, everything is from your heart. I gotta go. Go ahead. Mr. Chen. It's as big as... In fact, it's a fish tank. You can... keep some koi... lobster... Look here. There are mountain and water. This song is dedicated to a young couple. I have a new start because of them... Everyone wants to get happiness. Nightmare will come after happiness though. But after the nightmare, will only find true happiness.
