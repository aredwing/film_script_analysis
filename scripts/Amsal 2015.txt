A sudden visit from Governor-General Terauchi... "Sontag Hotel Seoul, 1911" Go downstairs. Governor-General Terauchi! Let's eat first! How's your health? Japanese medicine seems to suit me. Is that so? Kang In-guk... A golden business card? Yes, sir. His face tells me it's not going to be free. Your Excellency! Since poor Korea became a colony of Japan, we've become a vibrant industrial economy. If you could grant me the... gold ore mining rights in this country... I'd be most grateful. Operator! Operator! Your Excellency! Are you hurt? I will take you to safety! The Governor-General is in danger! The Governor-General! I'll protect you. You have my word. The Governor-Genera is critically injured! Doctor, that's enough. You should be lying down! How is the Governor-General? The shock has left him a bit loopy. But he remembers me? This is what he said: "Kang In-guk is my friend." "Have my soldiers protect him as they would me." What does that mean, huh? It means I smell some money! That's right! My twins' path to success has been cleared. Clear two paths. Since they're twins! What do you wish to ask? Did you tell anyone about our meeting today? No. Not even your wife? Of course not. Did you say anything? About today's meeting? To whom? The wet nurse, or anyone. Why don't you suspect me? Why you? Today... I was almost killed myself! - Would that be so wrong? - What? Japan conquered us without even a fight. Don't we deserve better? We were just handed over. By someone like you. Go inform on me. I'll say we planned it together. Don't be scared. Tonight I'll take him away. To where? Manchuria. Close the door. Ma'am, where are you going so late at night? To visit my relatives. Darling, won't it be a bit much for the twins? We should raise them strong. Please enjoy yourselves. Follow those two carriages, quietly. And kill all of them. Your wife too? Bring back my two daughters. Go. "Directed by CHOI Dong-hoon" "Written by CHOI Dong-hoon LEE Ki-cheol" Split up! That way! Get down. Throw away your gun! Don't move! Police! I'm sorry, ma'am. Close your eyes. Why should I close my eyes for you? "ASSASSINATION" Attempted murder in 1911 of the Governor-General! But it's not in the paper. Only the jail break of Yem Sek-jin. "1949, Investigation of Anti-National Crimes" They controlled the news, that's why. They captured Yem, and he escaped 10 days later. The first man ever to escape Central Police Station. He was a legend. He had two bullet holes in him, so he plugged them with his fingers and rode to Manchuria. How long were you with Yem? About 15 years? We both served under Kim Koo. Kim made Yem a police chief so Yem punished most of the spies. He was quite driven. But then why did Yem try to kill you in Shanghai? Back then... I was a Japanese spy. "1933 Japanese Concession, Shanghai" The Shanghai Advance, was a sacred war waged to secure peace in Asia. The Imperial Army of Japan crushed foreign forces in only a month. Who the hell are you? Sorry. In Seoul, Kang In-guk donated 10 airplanes to the Army. Korea Garrison Commander Mamoru then gave a rousing speech. Captain. There's a side door! Meanwhile, a massive search for Korean terrorists started in Shanghai. You go that way, and you try over there. A 50,000 yen reward for the head of Korean terrorists Kim Koo, and 80,000 yen for terrorist Kim Won-bong is offered. "Hangzhou, China" Turn back, we're fishing here! They say the Provisional Government of Korea is here. Who the hell are you? Go tell Kim Koo. I'm Kim Won-bong "Kim Koo, Vice-President of Provisional Government of Korea" Long time no see. I couldn't attend your wedding, sorry. Why'd you have it in Beijing? Are you mad at me? Well, I couldn't attend your wife's funeral. We're both in hiding, let's not fret over such things. Quite cozy in here. Things are still a mess after fleeing Shanghai. Still, we have everything we need. The Legislature. The Judiciary. The Executive branch is eating. Then, shall we go in? You two know each other? Of course. Good to see you're still alive. Just barely. But what is all this about, sir? We're planning an operation in Korea. Get this team together. Good work. Let's try to partner on this. Who's the target? Read about it in the papers later. But why use them instead of our men? Because the Japanese don't know their faces. And only the three of us know about this operation? The hunchback knows a bit. Has he been caught? He's on the wanted List. The woman's got the death sentence. Ahn Okyun! Sniper, 3rd Unit, Korean Independence Army. Jailed for shooting her superior officer, but they'll hand her over. Duk-sam! Leared explosives from the Hungarians but was caught and jailed for selling substandard products. This is Chu Sang-ok. Also called Big Gun. A bit lazy, but he trained at the Military School for Independence. They're both in the same jail. Bring all three to Shanghai. 10am, last day of October. Hotel Mirabeau. But have they all agreed? Well, it's your job to convince them. What was that noise? What was that? You don't hear that? I didn't hear anything. - Don't mind me. - Don't move. I've got a cold, don't come in! What the hell? Got me all worked up and sweaty. Bro, can you take me with you? These two months, I've come to respect you. What do you think you're doing? Shut up, you! Why won't this open? - Duk-sam! - Yes? Duk-sam is in one of those cells. Chu Sang-ok. It opens from this side. Is that so? Thank you very much. Damn! Who do they want us to rub out? I don't know, I just follow orders. Go with this guy and meet Kim Won-bong. At Hotel Mirabeau in Shanghai. Kim Won-bong wants to see me? That's quite an honor. I don't understand, why me? Because I've no wife or kids? This independence movement against Japan I've been riled up about it for 3-4 years. But not on an empty stomach. They should pay something. You trained at the Military School for Independence? You signed an oath in blood at graduation? Me? Did I? After ten years, I barely remember. "Before the leaves fall..." I remember! I wrote that line and then had a sudden attack of anemia. "Before the leaves fall, I'll take my gun and cross the border to home." That's an impressive oath. Let's cross that border, okay? Damn, I'll ask Kim Won-bong for the money. "Korean Independence Army Post, Manchuria" Men coming! Greetings. We request a transfer of Corporal Ahn Ok-yun. Where's the General? He's scouting now. An offensive is planned at dawn. This way. But tell me... Why did Ahn Ok-yun shoot that officer? Ah, she shot him by accident. She was wrongly convicted. Order of Special Release Corporal Ahn Okyun to be transferred to Provisional Government of Korea. This is Captain Yem. MY gun. Do you have bad eyesight? A bit. Does that make you nervous? I heard you took part in a few assassinations. I don't remember. Where am I going? SeouL That's good. Always wanted to go there. Thanks. Why do you want to go there? Well... try some coffee... Find a lover. But the work comes first, Captain Yem. - Shall we go? - Yes. Okyun, stay healthy! Be sure to come back alive. You just focus on the battle. I'll be back. - Bye, Okyun! - Bye! Goodbye. Blow out the light! What are you doing? The battle's supposed to start at dawn. I need to warn them. No. The Japanese are starting a surprise attack. We need to leave quietly. I can't leave like this. I'll just get the machine guns. All right. Just the machine guns. Thank you. It's too dark. When the battle starts, we set off flares. It's too far off. 170m? 180m? About that. Come on, the flare... You really shot that officer by accident? Says who? It was on purpose. We picked the right person. Let's go. "Japanese Consulate, Shanghai" Korean clans never work together. But Kim Koo and Kim Won-bong plan a joint assassination in Seoul? Where'd you hear that? I didn't hear it. I'm their messenger. I deliver the money. Kim Koo thinks I skimmed off the top. So did you? A little bit. How much will you pay for this info? What should we do? Who's the target? I don't know that. If it's true, we'll pay. Check the info first. "French Concession, Shanghai" So we part ways here? Yes, unfortunately. Indeed. Take care of yourself. Sure. Let's go! "Hotel Mirabeau" Learn some Japanese! I've reserved a room. Those Japanese gangsters on the wanted list are here. Coffee for me, too. Enjoy. The books say it tastes good. It's bitter. You need to add sugar. Attention everyone! Bonjour! I'm Inspector Melville. Please show me your ID. Everyone take out your ID! Be careful. They've got a price on your head! Identification! I'm French. I'm staying here. All right. What are you doing? Comrades should help each other. Identification. Identificafion? Honey, is our ID in the room? Are you two married? Yes. He's my husband. Do you just let Japanese gangsters come and go here? Of course not. Okay, back to the post. Yes sir. May I ask your name? Why do you want to know? It'd be a shame to leave without learning my wife's name. Follow them. Did they depart safely? I dropped them off at the station. Myung-woo! So what's she like? You should see her shoot. We ran into some Japanese soldiers, she killed four men with four bullets, right? This operation is going to be a success. I need to burn her photo. Now? Should I do it? No, I need to use the toilet. You guys eat. - Hey Myung-woo! - Yes! Order noodles for me. Okay. Duk-sam, Chu Sang-ok and Ahn Okyun. Tomorrow at 10am, they'll meet Kim Won-bong at Hotel Mirabeau. Oh, I'll catch a big fish. We'll catch him together. And get rich together. Can I kill the three in this photo? Everyone dies someday. Very well. Did you do martial arts? Tennis. Tennis... Tennis... That's a martial art? You haven't heard of it. Whack a guy like this, and he'll be shitting blood. But how old are you anyway? I was born in 1900. I'm from the 1800s. Hold on. Mirabeau is this way, so that way is a long life. Hey! Hey! Come back! You scoundrel. Don't you have any dignity? Don't you want your name in the history books? What nonsense. I want to live a long life. You just did Tennis? You're running away? Hey, you! We're being followed. Don't look. One man block the car, one man take the driver. Go! Aw jeez. Why are you following us? Aren't you going to Mirabeau? Duk-sam? Chu Sang-ok. How come everywhere we go, people know our names? Who are you? I'm Kim Won-bong. Who are you? I'm... Not so strong, are you? Comrade Duk-sam is about to lose his testicles. Ah, Wait! I said, wait! This one doesn't look so strong, either. Introduce yourselves. Corporal Ahn Okyun. This is Duk-sam. That's Chu Sang-ok. Weren't we meeting at 10am? You know the saying. A smart rabbit digs three tunnels. Shall we open the bag? Sir, call me Big Gun from now on. So... who do we have to kill? Take out the photos. After General Kim's victory over Japan, Japanese troops took revenge on Koreans living in Manchuria. They killed every man, woman or child they saw. Comrade Ahn... you were there? My mother passed away after being shot. She was fortunate. The others were ripped open with knives, beaten to death with clubs, strangled, burned in fires, buried alive, even boiled in cauldrons. Over 27 days, 3,469 people died. The massacre was led by Kawaguchi Mamoru. He heads the Korea garrison, and leaves soon for Japan. - Let's not send him back alive. - For sure. Kang In-guk, the leading pro-Japanese lapdog, is our second target. Kang In-guk and Kawaguchi will inspect the airplane factory on November 7. That's when you take them out. Any question? If necessary, can we hurt civilians? No. How about Japanese civilians? All civilians are innocent. Act like the bullets have eyes. Then, how about taking a photo? For the historical record. Comrade Ahn, you can change clothes. Okay. We can't fight on an empty stomach Captain Yem said you would cover our compensation. What's with you? He did. Did Captain Yem say that? Comrades. I'm sorry, but do you happen to have any money? Money? This is all I have... 4, 5, 6... You win! I'm broke. I'm outta here. Hawaii Pistol is coming in 5 minutes? Hawaii Pistol? They say he's coming. - Hey, what's going on? - I'm not sure. Get the car ready. Yes, boss. Hey, draw your guns. Help... Come here. Sir! What are you looking at? If you open a window, you'll die! Is that the hit man Hawaii Pistol? He's after the reward for the gang? They say he's Korean. No one's seen his face. He came from Hawaii, and will kill anyone for $300. He's a piece of trash. Let's go get our cash, sir. - Let's take our photo. - Yes. Sir! Thank you for choosing me. - But who is the leader? - Ahn Okyun. Why me? You should find the reason yourself. Anyone uncomfortable with a female captain? I am. Then let me ask. Why were you convicted? - For shooting my superior. - You be captain, then. Leave before sunrise. It's a long way to Seoul. After arriving, connect with the madam at Cafe Anemone Caf Anemone... Caf Anemone... Smile. Look happy. Say, "Long Live Korea!" Long Live Korea! Get me some water. That's hot! Captain! It won't kill you. Did they depart safely? Yes. Let's go, sir. I'll finish this cigarette. - The room is empty. - I think they already left. That can't be! Send this message. Out of the way! "Arrest at Hotel Mirabeau failed." "Request assassination target." Kang In-guk... Commander of the Korea garrison. November 7... Sir! Hello, sir. Hi. Myung-Woo! Yes? Where is Captain Yem? Downstairs. Should I call him? No. Can I borrow your gun? Shall I load it? No need. Captain Yem. Oh, hello sir! You weren't sleeping? I wish I could. The Japanese Consulate raided Mirabeau... a leak? Who could have done that? I like you very much. A born resistance fighter. At times a scholar, and at times a gangster. Why this, all of a sudden? You escaped from the police station 22 years ago, right? Yes. I remember. "1911, Central Police Station" Don't you want to live? What if you didn't escape from the police station but you agreed to become a spy for Japan? If you'd begged Sasaki to spare you? If so? Then I'll die right now. I have truly respected you. - Let's say none of this ever happened. - How can you suspect me? It could be someone at the Hotel! I suppose it could. Sir, should I go tomorrow and interrogate the hotel staff? Go to Shanghai tomorrow, then. Kim Koo suspects me... Did you search Yem's home? We found a wireless telegraph and codebook. Was there money? Yes. We left it there for now. If Yem meets Sasaki in Shanghai tomorrow, he's a spy for sure. If he's a spy, kill him. Passengers on the train from China please cooperate with ID checks and searches at platform exits. "Seoul Station, Korea" Oh, there she is. A new bargirl? No, she's my niece. Thanks for your help. Good to see you! Keep your composure. Thanks you two for delivering the alcohol. This way, right? Take off your hat. This is the 6pm notice. Salute for our country! "Caf Anemone" Thank you for coming all the way to here. It is hard to get weapons here in Seoul. Where does this lead to? There's a sewer tunnel right behind it. So when do we start? Kang In-guk's daughter Mitsuko has returned from Tokyo. The garrison leader's son is also coming to Seoul. In 5 days, the two families will have breakfast at Kang's and visit his airplane factory We need to hit the targets on their way to Seoul Station. Traffic slows around here, let's get them then. Will they have a military escort? Yes, soldiers stationed at every corner. So we should wage war in the mouth of the army? What's this? A gasoline store. Are there others on the way to Seoul Station? No. Then if Kawaguchi and Kang need to stop for gasoline? They'd turn left and come in here. The soldiers can't leave their posts, so we'll just need to face their guards. Let's seize the gasoline store and wait. Duk-sam, ride past on a bike and bomb the car. Big Gun and I will shoot the targets and guards. We'll finish in 5 minutes and come back alive. What's our escape plan? That night you take the train to Incheon Then board the Irish ferry for Shanghai at 23:00. What's 23:00? I thought the clock went up to 12? They lengthened it recently. At first, I took you for a person of average intelligence, But that plan's idiotic. Why would they come get gas? Someone will make them come. Who? Us. I should've run when I had the chance. Man, I wanna get drunk. You're in the right place. This is a bar, right? It's been too long since I've heard music. My life is nothing but struggle. Seoul is colder than Shanghai. No, I'm fine. Wow, look at the captain! Have a drink. Madam, I hear Seoul's gone decadent? Let's have a dance! Do you know how to dance? You just have to grab on and shake. Nice dancing! A Japanese bastard? A Japanese bastard named Kimura. I support Korean independence. I've worked for her for 10 years. Damn, we could all die tomorrow. Let's dance! Now, spin! That's right! When will you kill Kim Koo? I need an exit plan before I can kill him. Wait a bit. The information? November 7, two targets. Kawaguchi Mamoru and Kang In-guk. Oh, real bigwigs. How many targets? Three. Nationality? Korean. Korea's off the map. They're all Cubans, Americans, Mexicans and Chinese now. So, how much should I charge for three? I'd rather talk to Hawaii Pistol, not you. I don't look like Hawaii Pistol? Why not? Location? Seoul. Seoul? That's far. But who are you anyway? Independence fighters. Ah, I hate getting mixed up with those beggars here... Hey! Let me hear your voice. Don't hide like a coward. $2000 per person! Another $1000 each at the end. But if you fail... Have you gone mad? If you see his face, you'll die! And if we fail? What then? If you fail, it won't end with you returning the cash. I'll forget your face. Just get it done by November 7th. An independence fighter? Under whose command? Why do you care? You'll get the money anyway. Why do these three Koreans need to die? They're spies for Japan. Why? You know them? A drifter like me doesn't know anybody. See you in 10 days. Something doesn't feel right. Let's not meet for a while. They're blaming me for losing Kim Won-bong. I'll contact Seoul and report this. Captain, give me your gun! Myung-woo! Se-gwang! Give me your gun! Listen to me, will you? Give me your gun, Captain! - Myung-Woo! - Captain! I'll explain everything. Just listen to me! Myung-Woo! Who sent you? Was it Kim Koo? Did he order you to kill me? Myung-woo. Myung-woo... Myung-woo... The KIP, KRP, JRP, KHC, KCP... 30 independence factions, all fighting with each other. All with different cash sources. That's why they can't cooperate. Everyone's a thief. Everyone! And how come Kim Koo tried to kill me? I even told him I respected him! Sir! Mr. Yem. We won't be able to protect you anymore. I'm worthless now, is that it? But there's still one place where I fetch a good price. Where's that? SeouL You know what that pretty bird's name is? "Money Girl." But you're starting to worry me. You keep staring at Money Girl's photo. Time for you to get married? I'm more worried that you can't speak Japanese. Where are you traveling to? Seoul. Is there a problem? Officer, please follow us to the VIP compartment. This way. If you're navy, you're coming from Shanghai? Yes. What were your duties in Shanghai? Killing people. I'm with Kwantung Army, 23rd Division. Lieutenant Kawaguchi. 2nd Lieutenant Tanaka. This is 1st Lieutenant Nakamura. Nakamura? Were you injured while fighting Koreans? Huh? Did you kill many Koreans? Yes, yes. And you sir, did you kill many? What is your business in Seoul? It's a secret operation. I'm going to get married. To a Korean woman. Then it'll be our secret. Just you and me. I'll see you later, Tanaka. - It was a pleasure. - Take care. If I see that bastard again I'll rip out his guts. Buddy, where in this big city shall we start? As usual, the rickshaw company. Hey, what are you doing? What's happening here? Speak Korean, you! People who get off at Seoul Station, they take off with your rickshaws, right? Yes, right. That's why we're here. This guy knows! I don't know the men, But this lady, she arrived in Seoul a few days ago? Yes... Her name is...? Her name... thank you. Her name is Mitsuko. The daughter of Mr. Kang In-guk. Kang In-guk's daughter Mitsuko... Thank you, compatriots! But what unit are...? The motorbike outside, it's yours? Yes. Thanks for lending it to me. Oh... Wait! You know I'm building an airplane factory. Believe me, within 10 years there will be war. Then I'll make money and acquire a rank. What the hell? I'm so sorry. Who the hell did this? I'm sorry. It was our fault. You idiot! My apologies. Let me cover the cost of repairs. Hurry up! - Get it done today. - I will. Buy some new glasses, at the department store. Right now, in the first floor hall, A fashion show is taking place highlighting the newest Tokyo trends. Perfume from Japan... What the hell? It's on sale... Where do they sell glasses? Over there. Thanks. Is that clear? Yes. And not this one? That's correct. It will be ready. Come back tomorrow. You can't do it today? Then write down your address. Why my address? We run a late-night delivery service. It suits you perfectly. We received this one piece from Tokyo yesterday. This is a dilemma. It's twice as expensive as the department store in Tokyo. But I wouldn't want another woman wearing it. Mitsuko, what's wrong? Pay for this. It's a special sale, Sorry! Why? I made you angry just before. Kawaguchi. Let's end our date for today. Goodbye. What happened? Papa? He's not home. Shall I put on some tea? No. Mister! Can I have a word with you? We've got a real complication here. Don't sit like that. You're about to get married. It's a marriage of convenience. I know, it's how the world works. It's a marriage of lavish benefits. A question! When I was little, my twin sister died? After being kidnapped by a robber, right? Yes, that's right. But she didn't die then. Because... I saw her today! Aha. Hm. Aha, hmm? This isn't the first time you've said that. All right, so where was it you saw her? The department store. For now, keep it secret from Papa, okay? Is this the home of Kang In-guk? Yes, it is. Wow, I didn't know American cars could break. We'll replace this, and give the car a look over. Bring me some cold water. - Sure, we'll leave it to you. - Okay. God, look at that. So Money Girl is his daughter? - She didn't look rich. - Huh? Nothing, keep watching. What's this? You asked for water... Oh, water! - Have a good day. - You too. No other problems with the car. Very well. We got lucky, Sir. They fell into our laps. I'll go ahead. I'll pick up my Thompson from the cafe. You follow that car and check the location. I'll start with this guy here. Sure. Hello. Did this girl stop by today? The perfume seller directed me here. Here. We plan to deliver her glasses tonight. Give me two, please. Goodbye. Hey, can I have a light? Sure. Thanks. I guess you're heading there, too? To that famous pork restaurant? Ah, yes. You know why Korean pork tastes so good these days? Not sure. They castrate them all. I learned it in agricultural school. Male pigs are hard to control. But if you cut off their balls, they get real tame. And the meat gets nice and tender, too. Ah, is that so? This way, here. Ah. But you know, I bet the pigs probably want to keep their balls. Most likely. The Japanese, it's like they're cutting off Koreans' balls. What I mean is, there's no pork restaurant down there. If you get my meaning. Who are you? You don't need to know. Bastard! Is that so? I understand! Ali's quiet with the police, so I don't think he's caught. That Scoundrel. What the hell's he doing? Did he really run off? Anyway, here are your boat tickets for tomorrow. What do we do now, Captain? Gotta go through with it. There's no one to pump the gas. I'll pump the gas. This is the final stop, Seoul Station. That was delicious. You're too kind. Mitsuko cooked it herself. Is that so? Let me use your phone. What for? An urgent message for the police. Lieutenant Kawaguchi! The police are requesting you cancel your trip. The police have learned of an assassination plot. Commander, shall we cancel? People will mock us. It's hardly the first plot to kill me. Let's go! How about changing cars? - Hello. - Quiet! - What is it? - Go inside! What are those people doing? The guy I shot yesterday didn't look like a spy. You can't read someone's character in their face. Let's kill the others, get our $9000, and go to Hawaii. Buddy, you take the bicycle. Everyone! Attention! We're out of gas. Fill it quickly, and let's go. Yes, sir. Huh? Welcome! What are you doing? Move! They changed cars. They changed cars! It's that car there! It's a bomb! That car! It's a grenade! Start the car! Let's go! - Step on it! - Hurry! Keep going, quick! He's behind us! Let's go! Mitsuko! Mitsuko! Mitsuko! Take her alive! Who the hell are you? What rotten luck. The Commander? Only minor wounds. Kang is unharmed, too. And the culprits? They're being taken to Central Police Station. Why there? Bring them to the military police. They were foiled, thanks to you. Thank you very much. No, thank you. We're fortunate to have a man such as you. By any chance, Is the woman next to Kang In-guk his daughter? Yes, that's Mitsuko. Who the hell are you? Why'd you wreck our plan? I was hired. To kill you, Mitsuko. Mitsuko? Kang In-guk's daughter Mitsuko has returned from Tokyo. Mitsuko! Mitsuko! Shut up, you two. Don't talk to each other. You must be cold. A shame to kill such a beauty. What should we do? We need to make him come in here. Hands off! Oh, how scary! A kiss would probably do it. Are you insane? I should've killed you back there. You want to stay in here? It's not because I like you. What the hell? What's going on? No key to the handcuffs. Look up! Pass them! Sir! Money Girl! What are you anyway? Korean Independence Army. Sniper, 3rd Unit. Why bring a corpse to a hospital? Just toss her into a lake. So bothersome... Doctor, could you take something out of her shoulder? Go in. Huh? She's not dead yet? When will you kill her? Later. I'm out of bullets. Out of bullets? You should've told me! It seems there's a nail in her shoulder. Send everyone out. Get out! Um, you too. Me too? You just need to sterilize and bandage it. Who were you trying to kill back there? Commander of the Korea Garrison. And national traitor Kang In-guk. Even though he's your father? That trend passed a while back. There were eight men who sold Korea to Japan, getting rank in return. Their sons decided each should kill one of the other's fathers. People called it the Patricidal Club. And then... Do you really think killing those two will bring independence? In Manchuria, if the roof leaked we didn't fix it. Because we believed we'd go home to a free Korea soon. Will killing those two bring independence? Who knows. But we need to let them know. That we're still fighting. One shouldn't live only for money, like you do. Did you kill him? Our comrade, yesterday? Who sent you? I don't know his name. He's missing a finger. Captain Yem? He's the one who sent us here. In life, you know... Every household has their private tragedies You too, sir. I feel your pain. I see your sympathy for her. Let it go, shoot the girl, and let's split. We should go. But Buddy, before I could shoot her, she escaped to Shanghai. Unfortunately we've failed. Isn't that right, Buddy? No. Huh? - Thank you, doctor. - Yes. Can't believe this. There goes our reputation, and a river of cash. Did you see that? The police are everywhere. You want some bullets? Get in line. I said, get in line! What's your company? Who are you? Answer my question! What's going on? Carry on. What the hell? Tanaka! What are you doing there? Idiots. You inspect an imperial soldier who risked his life fighting in Shanghai? What's his name again? Nakamura? Watanabe? Kawa... Kawa... Kawashima? Lieutenant Kawaguchi! We meet again. What happened to your arm? What, this? It's nothing. Did you complete your secret operation? Ah, that... it's finished. Then would you serve as a guard at my wedding? I'm sorry. I'm deeply sorry. Hey! Why did you break from the line? Make everyone turn backward. Turn backward! So that makes four Koreans you've killed? Four? You mean this? I meant 300, not three. Visit me here tomorrow. I'll give you the invitation card. Then see you tomorrow. 23 Ahyeon Street, Ahn Okyun. Isn't this the man who tried to kill me 20 years ago? And saved your life this morning. And now he wants to sell me information? How'd an independence fighter end up here? If you can't bite, you shouldn't bark. I'll need 100,000 won for this information. You damn bastard! Have the nerve to name your price in front of me? Three assassins were sent from Shanghai, and one of those is identical to your daughter. Is this the daughter who was kidnapped by her wet nurse? That woman fired at me and the Commander? Does the Commander know about this? I haven't informed him yet. He must never find out. I have something to tell you. I know where she is staying. I was going to inform you this morning... You stupid ass! Our home is in grave danger and you're just going to watch it happen? Where'd you come from? Why did you shoot at us? I heard that I had a twin sister. You really do look just like me. Why did you try to kill Daddy? I came to kill a traitor. A traitor? That's why you wanted to kill him? Everyone lives that way here. Daddy's a nice man. Do you really believe that? I'm really happy. Meeting you, really. I burned that. Wear that instead. I respect independence fighters, too. But I wish you weren't one. There's a taxi waiting downstairs. Let's take it back home. Daddy will take care of everything, okay? Why should I go there? I'm going back to Manchuria. What's in Manchuria? My friends. And mother's grave. Check if this is Mommy. That's her. On the left. That's the wet nurse. Mommy's on the right. - You sure you came alone? - Yes. Stay in there for a second. I'll take care of this. I'm Kawaguchi's future bride. You're frightening me. First your wife, and now your daughter. I don't know that bitch. Let's say this. This woman made another attempt to kill you, but while apprehending her, she was shot. There you are, Miss. Shall I take you back home? No. Very well. Taxi! Attention! We're here, Miss. Welcome, Miss. You're not going to your room? Ah, please put this in my room. You're acting strange. You don't need to say "please" to me. Take a rest. What's gotten into you? Going to get the invitation? Kawaguchi will die by my hand tomorrow. Are you some kind of independence fighter? What if people hear you killed a Japanese officer for free? Then the Provisional Government will ask you to join them and order you to kill Japanese for free. What will you do then? If you keep farting, sooner or later you'll take a shit. Come on, sir. Sit down here. That's why I like you, Buddy. You know why they castrate pigs? Why should I care about castrating pigs? But I do care about your life. Your mother begged me on her deathbed. Why bring up my mother now? Don't worry. Go to Shanghai and track down Yem. I'll follow tomorrow. News bulletin. Today at 10:07, unknown assailants targeted Commander Kawaguchi, inflicting minor injuries. The upcoming wedding of the Commander's son will take place as scheduled at the department store. Meanwhile the identities of two men killed at the scene are yet to be determined. Now, we return you to the music program. Some guy shot me yesterday. Something's gone wrong. Let me borrow the car. If we leave for the port now, you can take the boat. I'm in this to the end. Forget the operation. Not in your condition. It's not about my condition. I went to the Military School for Independence. Get me my Thompson and the bombs Duk-sam left. And close the cafe tomorrow, you stay out of sight. Miss! What are you doing at this hour? There are only two nights left before your wedding. Get a good night's sleep. I will. Oh, and I found the girl who looks just like you. Her name's Ahn Okyun. She ordered glasses at the department store. Really? Miss? Aren't you curious to hear more? No. Why are you here instead of Mitsuko? You little rat! Operator! Central Police Station. Hello? Miss! Mr. Kawaguchi has arrived. - Ah, Tanaka! - How do you do? Have a seat. Where is the butler? Haven't seen him all morning. A cup of tea? Thank you. I am Mitsuko. Mitsuko... Ah, Mitsuko. You have a guest? Tanaka, from Shanghai. This is my fiance. Nice to meet you. What brings him here today? He'll be a guard at the wedding, postponing his trip to Shanghai. Shanghai? I hear you can get good coffee there. At the Mirabeau? You know the place? Do you speak Korean? A bit. I get a lot of abuse for not speaking Korean. Why didn't you go to Shanghai? To kill that bastard. What about you? And where's the girl who should be here? Dead. Killed by Kang, who thought it was me. Go back to Shanghai, this is my job. What will you do? I can go to the wedding. Since I'm the bride. Aren't you scared? I am. Let's speak Japanese. Here's your invitation. How's my wife-to-be? She's so beautiful... I wish her happiness. Seems like Mr. Tanaka cannot make it tomorrow. That's true, but... since it's an important day for Mitsuko, I'll make time. See you tomorrow. For his esteemed service to Japan, Yem Sek-jin is named Investigator for the Secret Service. November 8, 1933 Chief of Military Police. Did you find out? The Wedding's at the department store, tomorrow at noon. The store will be open but the 2nd floor closed off. Wait. Don't hang up. We haven't opened yet, what is it? So here's the famous Seoul bureau of the Provisional Government. I heard there were three bureaus. Where are the other two? I don't know what you're talking about. Come with us to the police station. Wait... Can I get my overcoat? Good luck. And be careful. It seems this is goodbye. This way, Mitsuko. Congratulations. Thank you. Congratulations, Mr. Kang. I wish the Governor-General could be here. I suppose he's very busy? He had to go to Japan. The Governor-General... Then I could receive my rank! Please leave your gun with us. I've come as Kawaguchi's special guard. 2nd Lt. Tanaka? This way. Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. I'll read a message from Governor-General Ugaki. "Kawaguchi Shunsuke and Mitsuko, My congratulations on your wedding. And congratulations to Commander Kawaguchi and Mr. Kang In-guk. Marriage is a new beginning. May you both rely on each other..." Get my clothes. MY gun! Follow me! Enter the groom! Why are you here? What is an independence fighter doing here? I told you. If you fail, it won't end with you returning the money. Take him to the head office. Are you nervous? What are you thinking, Mitsuko? Why'd you kill my sister from Manchuria? Enter the bride! The couple's fathers will now bow to each other. Close the door! Get that guy! Who are you? What the hell are you doing? That's hot! How many are there? One man with a machine gun. Up the main staircase! Operator! Connect me to the police! What the hell? Comrade Chu Sang-ok! Captain Yem? Big Gun! Headquarters! Send reinforcements! What the hell are you? Captain! Look out! Where's my daughter Mitsuko? You killed her. With those hands. My mother, too. I'm sorry. It was to protect our family. There's no more family now. It was for our people. Huh? Poor Koreans needed Japan's help. Anyway, I'm sorry. Sorry... The Patricidal Club, you know what happened to them? Some were caught. Some committed suicide. And some cowards like me became contractors in Shanghai. I don't want you to live with that burden. Go back. Go back to the Korean Independence Army. Duck. Let's leave first. You're coming with us. Comrade Big Gun! Captain! The operation's a success? Yes. You look pretty in that. Go, I'll see you downstairs. Go on. Are you the woman Mitsuko saw? One more word, and you die. Okay. The Commander is dead! Mr. Kang, too! Kawaguchi, Mitsuko, are you okay? Yes. I'll take them. Hurry to the hospital. Access the 2nd floor. The bride and groom have been kidnapped! There! Don't shoot! There are hostages! Don't shoot, the Commander's son is a hostage. We surrounded them first. Sir! I'm a bit late. Please get in. You really are something. Don't shoot! Stand by! Money Girl, good to see you! Turn the car around. Emergency! Attack on the wedding hall. Soldiers, mobilize! They're fleeing the wedding hall. Search for a black car heading for Myeong-dong. There's no way out. - There's a tunnel in the cafe. - Let's go. Both alleys are blocked. Heading for Caf Anemone. There's a tunnel behind the wall downstairs. Sir, Yem is coming! Hey, wanna talk? - Yem is... - I'll buy us some time. You really think you're something. In the end, you're just like me. - Did somebody pay you more? - No. I'm not a whore like you. If you're gonna sell out, get a high price. Release the hostages first and come out. I'll take care of everything afterwards. One hostage first. 10 minutes later, I'll come outwith the other one. Run, Yem! Life is short. Right. Life is short. Find out if there's another passage from this cafe. Yes, sir. There's no hope. Surrender. Kawaguchi. What did I tell you before? One more word, and you die. Ah, sorry! You go out the front. I'll take the dirty road with him. What...? You're Mitsuko. They think you're a hostage. Alone? I don't think you'll help our business. Right, Buddy? Yeah, right... We can't get involved with independence fighters. What are you doing? Keep hacking. Right, we need to go. Money Girl! Don't forget us! No! Why not? We'll meet in Shanghai. At Mirabeau. Can we meet again? Of course. We're husband and wife there. - Even if I don't know your name. - My name is.. Ahn Okyun. Go out, don't look at Yem, and go straight home. We'll send out the other hostage in 10 minutes. Buddy! I'll do it. Here, get in. Kawaguchi can handle a shot to the leg. - Get in. - Yes, sir! The district office says there's a passage in there leading to Cheonggye stream. Let's go to Cheonggye stream. Break in! Kawaguchi is dead! Can't they wait 10 minutes? We should visit Hawaii before we die, right? Of course. Women walk around there with no clothes on. Really? - Why? - Because it's hot. Because it's hot... Sounds like paradise. Let's definitely go. Sorry, Buddy. I should've listened to you. Actually, I'd like to keep my balls, too. Let's go. Okay. Today Japan declared its formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri. "Provisional Government of Korea, China 1945" The ceremony was held by the head of Japan's army and General MacArthur. Foreign Minister Shigemisu Mamoru has arrived. He was wounded in an assassination attempt by Korean patriot Yun Bong-gil in Shanghai The Japanese war of aggression, which inflicted such ghastly damage to the people of Asia and the world, is finally over. Is that the last donation we received? It's been more than 10 years. Money and info about the Japanese Government-General. I'd like to meet this person. Need to know who it is first. Why so glum? It's liberation. It is liberation. But so many people died. Choi Soo-bong, Na Seok-ju, Duk-sam, Chu Sang-ok... Stop. People will forget them, right? I'm sorry. No, it's me who's sorry. I'm sorry for them. I am sorry. The war is over! We have independence! Let's go home! Let's go home! You damned traitor! "1949, Seoul" The trial regarding crimes against the nation will now open. Prosecutor, you may speak. The defendant is accused under relevant laws of acting as a spy and committing destructive acts while a member of the police. Defendant, state your name, age and position. Age 62, Yem Sek-jin. Currently a Republic of Korea policeman. What is your personal stance on the Law of Anti-National Crimes? For the sake of history and social justice, I think it's right. But I believe it is a mistake that I'm sitting here due to a single anonymous letter. What is your basis for such thoughts? Everything I've ever done was for the sake of liberation. We call a witness to testify that Yem informed Japan of three independence fighters plotting to assassinate Kawaguchi Mamoru and Kang In-guk in 1933. Please bring in the witness. Just a moment. Defendant! Put out your cigarette. Stop smoking, you traitor! - Defendant! Put on your clothes! - Compose yourself! This is a court of law. What do you think you're doing? The public will be barred from further hearings! Six Japanese bullets have entered this body. In 1911 I was shot during my attack on the Governor-General. It left two holes. This is from 1922 in Shanghai, this from 1927 in Khabarovsk. 1932, the Itsumoho Bombing. Next to my heart, 1933! You say I sold three comrades, but I chose them myself! Can you understand what those young people felt? No, you can't! Or how I felt, sending them off! It was a march of resistance in the face of death, your honor! That is all. The witness is dead! Due to a lack of evidence, the charges leveled against defendant Yem Sek-jin are formally dismissed. He gets a 20,000 won fine for contempt of court. Congratulations. Attention, salute! Congratulations, sir! I'll drive you home. No, no. It's a beautiful world. I'd like to walk. Then I'll join you. You'll disturb my solitude! Yes, sir. Let's go. Dissolve the Anti-National Crimes Committee! Push for Unification! Hello. I'll take this. This, too. Mitsuko? Myung-Woo? Ahn Okyun? Why'd you betray your comrades? I didn't know. I didn't know we'd be liberated from Japan. If I'd known, would I have done it? Myung-Woo! My mission from 16 years ago. "If Yem is a Spy, kill him" is now fulfilled. Say "Long Live Korea!" Long Live Korea! Hey, Money Girl! Don't forget us!
