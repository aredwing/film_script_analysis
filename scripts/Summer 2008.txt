You fucking idiot! God! - Shit! Shaun! - Jesus! - Are you OK? - I can't feel my legs. - Very funny. - I told you I could beat them kids. - What a prick. - You've got to have some fun. - I'll fucking leave you next time. - Well, leave me, then. Come on. - For fuck's sake! - Is it hurting you? Good. - Where are you going? - To get the rucksack. And fucking leave me here? Oh, that's better. That's it, we're on a roll. - Do you want one? - No. Alright, Shaun? - You alright? - Aye. How's your dad? Asleep. I've got a test tomorrow. - What about? - English. I need some help. - Spelling, is it? - And other stuff. - What did you get last time? - Seven out of 20. - It's not my fault you can't spell. - I can't spell. You're better off talking to a fucking dog. - Get the kitchen cleaned up. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Come on, you lazy twat. Come on. Come on, Shaun. Come on. Leave him. Shauny. Shaun. Shaun! Shauny! - Shaun? - Shaun? - Shaun? - Come on, Shaun. Shauny? Mum says I've got to be back at nine, Shaun. - Nine? - Revision. - Fuck that, it's a waste of time. - It would be for you. Fuck off. - How's your woodwork? - Making a box. - That's exciting. - It's a fucking waste of time as well. - Everything's a waste of time to you. - That's cos it is. - It's better than nothing. - I suppose. Woody reckons I can pass if I do alright in my coursework. - I'll give you a hand if you want. - What, now? - With your coursework. - If you want. - What do you have to do? - Write a bit about my project. - Doesn't sound too hard. - Then I've got an exam. You'll do alright. Not as good as making babies. - Get off, Shaun! - That's if your ma lets me. - She hopes you fall under a bus. - That's awfully nice of her. - What does she see in him? - She's fucking gagging on it. Don't be rotten. Daz, do you need a hand there, mate? - You coming? - No, too cold for me. - Katy? - Boo! - Fuck! - Go on, then. You'll have to catch me first. - Come on, Katy! - Come on. Hey! Hey! - Right, see you later, then. - See you. Katy. - Get yourself inside now. - Coming. - Night, stud. - Don't fucking encourage him. Now! Afternoon. Sod off and make someone else's life a misery, Shaun. Love you, too. Come on, Daz. Hurry up! - Shaun, wait up. - Shaun, slow down. I can't. Got no brakes. Come on, Daz. Hurry up. - Shaun, slow down! - Katy! - It's your mam. - I can see. - We can do a runner. - Scary. - You were meant to be in an hour ago. - Mrs Biggs. I'm coming. - See you. - See you. Do you think she'll marry me? Even a fucking dog wouldn't marry you. That's not very nice, is it? Whoa, yeah! Come on, Daz! - Do you want one? - No. - Did you bring your sample? - Yeah. - Lift the blanket up. You'll get cold. - Alright. - Keep yourself warm. - I'm alright. Fucking... - Oh, God, smell that nurse. - Behave yourself. I want one for breakfast. - Morning. - Any chance of a bed bath? - Sorry, love. - God, I love this place. - Have you been feeling sick? - Yeah. - Worse than usual? - Yeah, I suppose. - Is there blood in the vomit? - No. - Aye! - Well, just a bit. So am I dead, then? Well, the cirrhosis is very advanced. The liver function is deteriorating and that would account for the jaundice and the vomiting. There's also further kidney damage and we really need to sort out the way you're managing your diabetes, which is a little chaotic. You missed the dandruff. Sorry. - Darren. - Sorry, sorry. You might have between four and eight weeks. Oh. Best book a holiday, eh? - Still a chance of a transplant? - I don't want a transplant. - You don't know what you want. - You're worse than my mam. - Just top yourself now, then. - For fuck's sake. Fucking hell. We need to focus on getting you through the next few weeks. We've got to think about where we can give you the best care. We've been doing alright, though. Darren needs specialist help now. Like what? Well, we could think about a hospice. I want to be at home. - Fancy a drink, then? - You're joking, aren't you? lt'll be my last chance. - I'm not buying you a drink. - I'll buy. - You're skint. - Disability's due. Oi! Daz! - Wake up. - Sod off. I told you, no disco dancing at night. Fuck you. - Should have you put down. - Bollocks. Right, you ready? One, two, three... How's your bag? It's that cheap vodka. It makes me piss. We should have you plumbed into the mains. Fucking very funny. My sides are splitting. - Mr Biggs? - Yeah? - It's Shaun. - Shaun? - Shaun Sedman. - Shaun! - Been a while. - Yeah. - How you doing? - Keeping busy. - It's Shaun, Karen. - I know who it is. - Alright, Mrs Biggs? - What do you want? I were looking for an address for Katy. You're joking? No. I thought she might be interested in what's happening to Darren. - What about him? - He's ill. - III? - Dying. Leave her alone. The last thing she needs is a visit from you. - I heard she's a teacher. - You heard wrong. She's a solicitor in Sheffield. Why don't you give him her bloody phone number? - Karen... - Shut the bloody door. I'm sorry, youth. Right. - No, Shaun, you can't go to the toilet. - I need a pencil. Right, spellings. Country. Country. County. County. Believe. Believe. Because. Because. What the fuck are you laughing at? You, you fucking spastic. Fucking arsehole! Bastard! Bastard! - Go on, hit him! - Kill the bastard! - Fucking bastard! - Get off him! Now! - Fucking... - Get off him. - Sedman! - You fucking bastard! - Who's the spastic now? - Jesus Christ! What have you done? - He fucking started it! - My office! Get off! Fucking leave me! You'd fucking better! Calm down, lad! Fuck off! He assaulted three boys, Janice. He broke Paul Davies's jaw and fractured his skull. - You're lucky he didn't kill him. - He doesn't like it here. He's disruptive and bullies other children. He is not a bully. I've two staff members that won't teach him, let alone complaints I've got from other parents. - He can't keep up in class. - He's not even trying, Janice. He needs help. He's been getting all the extra help we can give. Well, he needs more. Maybe you could help him a bit more at home. So it's my bloody fault he can't read? Of course not. Shaun's got a below-average IQ. But you told me he should still be able to read and write. He's always been on borderline of entry to a special needs school. Special needs? You'll have a fucking special need if he doesn't read by the time he leaves. - He has left, Janice. - No, we've got a whole term... He's going to be expelled. I've got no choice. - Expelled? - I'm sorry. - Janice. - Fuck off! Come on. Alright, love? What we gonna do with you, Shaun? I don't know. Alright? - How's your mam? - She's alright. Tell her I'll see her on Friday. I will do. - Don't forget. - I won't. Give us a chip. - Do you ever stop fucking eating? - Give me the brown sauce. Oh, that is disgusting. How can you eat that? - Do you want one? - You are sick. That's what my mum said last night. She thinks I've got worms cos I'm not eating her vegetables. They're fucking foul though. Come on. - Where are we going, then? - To rob a bank. - Smartarse. - Fanny. Three months? I don't go back till I start secondary. - Lucky bastard. - I should've broke his neck. - Three months off school? - I fractured his skull. - I need to hit someone. - Hit Smithy, he wouldn't notice. - What did your mam say? - She's not bothered. - Really? - Weren't my fault anyway. - You coming? - Fuck it, come on. You fucker! - Fuck! - Shaun! - Fuck! - Fucking hell! Jesus fucking hell! So what I want to try today is a basic job application letter. OK? So off you go. Any problems, just give us a shout. That's very good. Good. Good stuff. Shaun? Are you OK? - Do you want a hand? - Yeah. OK. Let's have a look. Good. Not a bad start. Now, why don't you try the other kind of "would"? Yeah? - Half right, then? - You'll get there. Is that a promise? - Shaun, are you online? - No. Well, aye. - You're meant to be learning. - I know. - It's not porn again, is it? - No, that was an accident. You were printing it out. In colour. Well, it looks crap in black and white. Two minutes and I want that letter finished off. Yes, miss. - Stop it. You'll put the fucker out. - I won't. God, it's freezing. - Get closer to the fire. - Lend us your jumper. Ta. That's it now. You two are gonna have to get married. Shut up. - Swot. - Thicko. - What are you smiling about? - Nowt. Oh. Thanks. Love you. You're meant to say you love me. Are you OK? Aye, apart from this fucking bramble up my hole. Don't! Oi, Shaun. Hey up, they've come up for air. She doesn't look that happy about it. Let's be serious, it's hardly winning the jackpot, mating in a bush with fucking Daz. Shit! Fucking hell, Shaun, leg it. - Come on. - Come on! Come on! What the hell are you doing? Shaun, fucking hurry up! The fucking bastard's got a gun. Come on! Oh, fuck! Fuck. Do you think he was watching us? You know. Dirty bastard. Oh. I'll be late. - Oi. Any of you lot seen Tracy's pants? - Her pants? My mam'll kill me. I only got them last week. Daz'll go back for them. Yeah, and get a shotgun up my arse. Don't be stupid. I'd go back for Katy's. - Katy doesn't wear any. - Daz! Fucking hell! Why didn't you fucking tell me? I'm still your dad, you know! - It's no big deal. - Why didn't you tell me? - You don't fucking care if I go! - I do care! - It's only a warning. - Your fucking last warning, it says. - Where have you been? - Hanging out. Right. I'll have the fucking bus fares back, then. - I've spent it. - On fucking drink, I'll bet. - You want to lecture me on drink? - You fucking cheeky little bastard! - I'll have you! - Yeah, fuck you, Dad. Fuck you too, you little twat! - Fucking bastard! - What's the matter? College has given the little bastard a written warning. - What for? - I thought he'd been fucking going. So did I. Fucking little sod. He'd be better off with his fucking mam! Probably. What's up with you? Oh, nothing. Weren't she pleased to see you? - She's busy. - Busy? Doing what? Doing very well for herself. - I fucking told you, didn't I? - Fuck off, Daz. What? For fuck's sake, what were you expecting? A fucking blow job? Fucking hell. What about me shower? I said what about me shower? Sorry, mate. You want your shower? Fucking hell, steady. Fucking hell! Shaun, what are you fucking doing? You dirty bastard! You fucking twat! - It's freezing, you cunt. - Your fucking soap. Fuck off! You fucking wanker! For fuck's sake. I'm fucking piss-wet through! It's fucking freezing, you twat! I'll fucking get you for this! Go on, fuck off and sulk, you twat! That's it. I'm fucking out of here, me. I'm fucking off with Daniel. You can fucking live on your own, you twat! I'm fucking serious, you know! You fucking bastard. - I'm gonna fucking have you for this. - Fuck. You're on your fucking own now. I'm out of here. - Shaun? What's going on? - Nothing. I just fell over. - What's up with Daz? - Fucking bastard. Wrong kind of shampoo. Come on. You're fucking sulking still? Fucking lover boy. - Blew you out, did she? - Fucking prick. Well, fuck you. If I could get out of this chair, I'd kick your fucking head in. Come back here, you fucking soft twat. Pick on someone your own fucking size. Yeehaw! It loves you, Daz. - Come on, Daz, it loves you, man. - Get off me case. Get off me case! Fuck off. It serves you right. - He could have killed me. - Huh? Shaun. He tried to kill me with that horse. It's a pony. Horses have to be bigger. It looks fucking big enough to me. What are you doing? Shaun's coursework. Right. But that ain't exactly... It's not very... - What? - It's not very neat, is it? It's not meant to be, is it? If it has perfect handwriting, they might think he had help. Oh, yeah, that's true. - You gonna help with mine, then? - No. That's not fair, is it? - You're not doing any exams, are you? - No. You haven't got any coursework, have you? No. Now go away. - He's coming. - Go on. - What, on that? - Aye. Go on. Piece of piss, mate. Watch. - How's it going? - Finished. Am I going to pass? Of course. Just remember to write your name on the exam. That's me fucked then. What's he trying to do to it? - How do I get on him? - Fuck knows. Stay still. I don't even want to know. Shaun. It's OK. It's me. Katy? Shauny. Shaun! Shaun, it's my dad. You alright? Alright, go back to bed. I'll be there in a minute. - Hi. - Hello. I'm looking for Katy Biggs. I'm afraid she's very busy. Right. I came a long way, just on the off chance, you know. I'll see if she's free. He says his name's Shaun Sedman. He says that he knows you. What do you want me to tell him? Erm... Katy, are you OK? Yeah. Sorry. Erm... You just... I can't see him. Can you just tell him I'm with a client? OK. I'll make sure she gets that. Right. Oh, fuck! - Fucking thing! - Sedman! One more noise out of you... - Sit down. - Listen, I can't do it. I can't fucking do it. Get out now! You're gonna be fine. - Mrs Sedman? - Yeah. Can I have a word, please? The bones are badly crushed and he's severed the tendons. He's lucky not to have lost it. Will he still be able to use it? He might have some use. It's difficult to say. - Right. - How did this happen? They said he did it to himself. Why would he do that? - He gets upset at school. - Upset? He's got a learning problem. Has he had psychiatric help? He's not mental, he's just a bit slow. OK. What's up? What are you staring at? Nowt. You're getting fucking worse, you are. Isn't it about time for your happy pills? Oh, yeah. Do you want a couple? Yeah, fuck it. Why not? # Don't you like the way I move when you see me? # Don't you like the things that I say? - Here we are. - Thanks. - I've seen your ma. - Yeah, she said. Aye. Nice blather, cup of tea and a biscuit. It was really nice. Liar. I think she may have mellowed with age. Not really. But then you never were very popular. No. How's your hand? It's alright. I really wish you would have said something to me. Seemed like a good idea at the time. It's really great to see you, Katy. - I should have kept in touch. - So should I. - I did write. - I know. My ma brought them. You could have phoned me. I did try and find you, you know, once I got out. They said you were away. - Yeah. University. - Right. So how bad is Daz? - Not so good. - Well, that tells me everything. Well, he's got a liver problem. Loads of other stuff. Is that because of the accident? That and the drink. But it's treatable? Not really. Not any more. Be with you in a minute. I shouldn't have come, should I? No, Katy, I wanted you to come. - No, I shouldn't have come. - You should have. I wanted you. - No. - Katy. - Do you want the money? - Wait a minute. Will you call me? - You'll have to go back. - Whatever. - It won't heal right. - Good. Ow. Watch! - What's up with you? - Nowt. - Why are you doing this? - Fucking thing never worked anyway. - My mum thinks you're mental. - Fucking bollocks. She's told me not to see you. - She's always saying that. - I mean it, Shaun. She's on about moving so I can go to Chesterfield Girls'. Moving? - She wants me to do A-levels. - I bet she does. She wants to get away. - From what? Me? - Yeah. You're winding me up. She means it. She says you're violent, out of control. I'm not fucking violent. Well, I'm not, am I? - Only when you get angry. - The fuckers shouldn't get me angry. I'll tell Mam that. I'm sure that'll change her mind. You're not really going to go, are you? I don't know. Mam seems pretty serious. We could get a flat. What, with all that cash you've been hiding from me? You could still come and see me, though. Shauny! Shaun! - Shauny! - What is it? It's Daniel. He's at the club. He's pissed. So what else is new? - Fetch him for us. - I'm going to work. Oh, come on, you've got time yet. Won't take you long. Cheers. Have you seen our Daniel? Not since I kicked the silly bugger out. - What did he do? - He tried to glass Dave Elliot's lad. - Oh, fuck! - He's a chip off the old block. Alright, Shaun? Daniel? Dan? You alright, son? Come on, Dan. Come on, Daniel. Jesus Christ. Look at the state of you, eh? Come on, Dan. Wake up, pal. Wake up. Come on. You alright? Come here. Come here, come here. Come here, come here. Come here. You stupid bugger. Aren't you? Come on, son, we'll get you home. Come on. What happened to your shoe? That's it, up you go. That's it, I've got you. It's not gonna work like this, pal. Come here. There we are. You silly bugger. What's all this I hear about you fighting? Hey? Tracy's taking the fucking piss, mate. Well, she's three weeks late. You've not even had her top off yet. It's not the top bit that gets them pregnant. - Did you not use nothing? - No, I ran out. I've got loads. You should have said. You weren't fucking there, were you? - You are a stupid bastard, honestly. - I don't care. What's she doing? She getting rid or what? Don't know. Come on, lads, you know you're not meant to be here. We're just looking. Shaun, you're suspended. In case you were wondering, that means you don't come to school. Daz needs the company. Darren, you don't need to be here. You're not doing any exams. I'm doing girls' netball. We've already called the police, Shaun. I'm asking you reasonably, please go home. - We weren't even doing nothing. - Thank you. - Wanker. - Very clever, Shaun. You're a wanker! ... making it one of our most lucky lottery numbers. And the next ball is number 40. That's come up twice during the last month. Number 37. And the bonus ball, number 29. That's the holiday off, then. Told you we should have gone for 43. The other five numbers were just as fucking wrong. - I've a got a new one. - Oh? Serial number of the chair. And 40. So congratulations to all our winners tonight. - You want some tea? - Yeah, go on, then. Fuck off. It's all fucking shite. Daz, do you want some of this pork roll? Daz, do you want some pork or what? Stop fucking about. Daz? Daz? Hey. Daz, for fuck's sake! Shaun. - How's he doing? - He's not so good. Thanks. You might want to call his mother. I already phoned her. She's in a taxi. OK. - Can I see him? - Of course. Hurry up. Some fucker's gonna see us. Push! Fucking get off my head, you knob! - Daz! - What? Come here. What? Sure that's how you spell "wankers"? For fuck's sake, it starts with a W. What more do you want? You got a light? What are you doing? Mate, I'm burning my file. Watch and observe. Burn, you fucker. Yeah. Come on. It'll burn better than that, though. Give us that. I'll show you a fire. What are you doing? - It's not gonna burn. - Bet you it will. - It's got special paint on it. - So? Yeah, that means it's fireproof. How do you know? # Gilly told me in detention What, fireproof? Doesn't matter what you do, it won't burn. Oh, won't burn? Put it out. - How am I supposed to put it out? - Fucking do something. Fucking twat. Fucking hell, Shaun! - Shaun? - Yes, mate? I've had enough now. I know. Are you gonna stay this time? I'm not going anywhere. - What are you doing? - Split up. - Fuck that! - Just dump the bike and run. I can't just fucking dump my bike, can I? Shaun! Shaun! Daz! Daz! Daz! - Shaun! - Get the fuck off me! - Stop it! - Get the fuck off me! Bastard! - Shaun! - Get the fuck off! - Get off him! - Get off me! Daz! Shaun! Give us a bit of that. What's up? I need to talk to you. He's dead, then? I'm sorry. - You'd best come back. - I'm staying out. - Daniel. - Don't fucking matter now, does it? He was a fucking pisshead, a fucking waster. He's dead. Oh, God! Oh, please, God! Oh, God! Hey, Shaun? Daz? Daz? It's me. What are you doing? Nothing. Are you alright, man? Come on, you miserable fucker, get up, man. Come on, Shaun, seriously. Get up. Shaun. Fucking... You stink, man. You need a wash. I ain't fucking moving till you get up. I'll see you later, then, yeah? - Don't get hammered. - No, Zoe won't let me. Yeah. - How is she? She alright? - Fucking fantastic. Seriously, Shaun, you should see her tits, mate. - Alright, youth? - Alright. Fuck. I forgot the wreath! Come on, come on. Wreath! - Hurry up. - Alright, alright! He's not gonna run off, is he? God so loved the world that gave His only son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. The eye has not seen nor ear heard nor the heart of man conceived what God has prepared for those who love Him. On behalf of the family, can I welcome you all to our service? Thank you for coming and sharing this special occasion as we say farewell to our dear friend Darren. Saying goodbye is always painful, but I hope the pain will be eased by the very special and positive memories we have of him. - It's freezing. - Yeah. - Do kids still swim here? - Too dangerous now, they say. Yeah, well, it probably is. Nobody needs the woods any more. All the kids have got cars to shag in now. Still the romantic, then. - Why do I have to do this? - Shut up moaning. - What are you up to, Shaun? - You'll see. - I really should be getting back. - Katy... Look. I've wanted to say... Yeah? ...that I've missed you. Well, I've missed you, Shaun. I still think about you... ...like we were back then... before. Oh, Shaun. Just cos I'm here now, it doesn't mean... No. I'm not expecting you to rip your gear off or anything like that. I'm sorry. I just wanted you to know... ...back then... ...was the best summer I ever had. Oh, Shaun. It's done. You want to fuck it or float it? Yeah, alright. Bollocks. It's not even that deep. Just go in! Everyone says it's 50 foot deep. Everyone says aliens run the chip shop. There's pikes in here that bite your bollocks off. You're full of shit! Lovely and warm. Look! There's sharks. Fucking sharks! It was big. Shaun! Shaun! Come on! Shaun! Shaun! The bastard's got a gun! Come on. Shaun, come on! Oh, my shoe. Wait! Daniel! - What? - Nothing. I'll have to pay for that now. I bet this is the first thing to go down on you in a while. Cheeky bastard. - Alright. See you. - See you. - Sorry if I pissed you off earlier. - You didn't. I'm quite house-trained these days. Well, most days. - What's going happen to Dan now? - He'll stay with me. You should go. Yeah. You know where I am if you fancy a bit of rough. For old times' sake. You really haven't changed, have you? You can't blame a guy for trying, not now you're driving a car like that. Alright? Bye, then. - Zoe's staying for tea. - Alright. What are you making? Nothing till you clean up your bloody room. Seen that.
