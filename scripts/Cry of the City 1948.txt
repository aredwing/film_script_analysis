What do you want? For 5 years he pulls every trick in the book. Tonight he holds up a restaurant and kills a cop. No record? l mean medical, sir. Why did they do this to him? Marty. Marty. Tina. You shouldn't have come. l'd to come, Marty. The radio... ...said you were badly hurt. lt said you were... Go away, Tina. Don't get mixed up in this. Marty! Why did you have to shoot? Why did you kill? l had to. l thought we could... Marty,... ...does it hurt terribly? Kiss me. l can die now. Marty! Marty! Lieutenant! We bill the Police on this, right? Right. Keep him alive. We'll give you a bonus. Will his wife sign for the operation? He has no wife. -l thought that the girl... What girl? -The girl that's in there now. Are you sure you saw a dame? Collins! l tell you this is a matter of a man's life. l must see him. Dr. Williams is operating immediately. l can't let you go up. Hi, Counsellor. Lieutenant Collins! l didn't know that chasing ambulances was in your line. This is serious. ls Martin Rome still alive? Just about. You've got to let me see him. He hasn't got a quarter. l'm not interested in defending a cop killer. l knew McReady, too. Yeah. What do you want from Rome? lf he's dying. l want a confession. He can save an innocent man. Confession to what? His implication in the de Grazia case. The de Grazie case? You're crazy. We're holding Whitey Leggett on that. All we need is to get... That's right. Leggett's my client. l admit it. He's done plenty, but he didn't do the de Grazia job. lf l can talk to Rome, l can prove it. Torturing old ladies? Rome doesn't go in for that. -Candella, please,... ...time is precious. l wouldn't come here on a wild goose chase. This is a man's life. Maybe we'd better let him. Okay. lt's okay with the doctor, it's okay with me. lt's in his hands now. -Thank you. Rome,... ...can you hear me? This is Niles, the Lawyer. Do you understand? l want you to concentrate just for a few seconds. Rome, they're holding Whitey Leggett. Whitey Leggett... ...for the de Grazia case. He didn't do it, Rome. He did not do it. You know that. You can save him. Rome,... ...you're in bad shape,... ...you may not pull out. Don't go with this on your soul. Please, Rome,... ...just tell us you were in on the de Grazia case. Rome... Don't say nothing, just nod. You killed her. Just nod. You killed Mrs. de Grazia. Go... ...fry. Rome, listen to me for a moment, will you? He's unconscious again. -Can't you... for another minute? lf we don't get your friend to surgery he'll never come to. That's tough. l did my best. Did you catch what he said there? Why, l think he... -l heard him. He told you to go fry. l think he meant it. lf you want us to say that in court, we'll be glad to. Of course, of course. All ready for you. -Thanks, Julio. How you doing? -l ain't kicking. How's Martin Rome making out? ls he going to live? Yeah, l think so. lt was doubtful, but l think he'll pull through. l see his mother heading for a church every day. l think he'd 've saved'em some grief if he'd died. Maybe you're right. See you tomorrow. Take it easy, Lieutenant. Close enough? l haven't the strength. Miss Pruett. Yes? Would you see if it's close enough,... ...please. Nurse. Well? What do you want? Could l talk to you a minute? l ought to tell you that... ...Rome's a pretty bad with the woman. What is does to me? Just l would tell you in case... -Look Lieutenant,... l've been here for years. Don't tell me how to care for patients. l beg you pardon. You should. She's pretty hot, Candella? -Smart guy. We ought to throw you in a cell. Full of bullet holes, wherever you look. Even the doctor say... -Don't look for sympathy, Rome. l just left the wife of the guy you killed, you rat. She looked fine,... ...eyes all red, tears streaming down her face. And you getting shaved. l ought to beat you! -Go ahead. Beat me, l'll die. Yell at me,... ...l faint. Answer me the questions... ...and drop that fancy lingo, see? Listen to me. Marty. -Yes, Lieutenant. ls this your ring? -Yeah, that's mine. You got the rest of my stuff?. -Where did you get it? How about it? Where did you get it? l don't know. Crape game lt's all right. l do well with the dice. Who from? From? Blond Fellow. With the droopy eyes. Leggett! Whitey Leggett. You know we have Leggett on the Grazia Case. Who else was in the game? l don't know. Tommy Mills, maybe. -Tommy Mills is dead. What do you ask me all this stuff for? l win a ring, so what's the difference? Come in, nurse. We'll only be a minute. Marty. This ring was stolen from Mrs. de Grazia. Not by me. -With 100,000 dollars more. Did you read about it? Nope. -We want whoever did it. They tortured the old lady until they found the stuff. Then they strangled her. Not very pretty. You got Leggett, go talk to him. We will,... ...but we want to talk to you, too. l shoot a policeman, he shot at me. Now l'm going to the chair. Suppose l say a did it, so what? l go twice? l'd nothing to do with it. Besides, a fellow and his girl did the job. So you do read the papers. You got a smart partner. l never worked with a girl in my life. Talk too much. Marty. What girl was with you when they brought you in? Wasn't it a dream? Was she here? -Yes, Marty. Who was she? -l don't know. l wish l did. What did she look like? An angel. l thought maybe... ...l was dead. All right, cut it out. We found the ring on you. We know that the girl was here. Stop the monkey business. Tell me who she was. l never saw her before. Okay, Marty. But you'll be seeing her again... ...because we're going to find her. Don't think for a minute we won't. Come on, Collins. Here, take this. No. -You've got to. l'd sooner die. Something heavy here press on me. Your conscience. Did you hear those two? They said l tortured an old lady. Me, Martin Rome. You know people. Do you think l'd do that? You killed a policeman. He'd me down. lt was him or me. You must do something. Do something for you? -No, not for me. This is for a girl, my girl. No, wait, please. You heard them. They said l'd an accomplice, a girl. l swear to you this girl is innocent. Then she doesn't have to worry. -She has, she's a child. lf they ask her, she won't know what to do. She won't have a chance. You've got to help me, you've got to. There's nothing l can do. -But there is. Look. Her name is Teena, Teena Riconti. The cop don't know that. l tell you because l trust you. This is her address, 25 Bank Street. Where did you get the paper? -Please, just go to her. Tell her to go away... -You can't talk me into that. Just see her, look at her. You'll know. Here. l've police permission to talk to him. Go ahead. Hello, Martin. How're you? -Fine. We go bowling? At least your mind's all right. Martin,... ...l'm going to defend you. Why? l think l can get you off. You talk pretty good. l think l like this. How're you going to do it? There are angles... ...self-defense. McReady's killed a couple of other men. l need your complete confidence though. Of course. The D.A. thinks you were in on the de Grazia case. Might not be a bad idea to admit it. Why? That's the angle. The whole city's on the D.A's neck over the de Grazia case. Robbery and murder. For a confession... ...l think he might make a deal. Second degree. -Second degree? No chair. lt's not bad. As long as you're alive. There's always probation. Might take time but... But if l confess, so what? How am l going to prove it? l got no jewels. l don't how the job was done. Yes. There's a chance l might get one or two pieces of it. l wondered why you came in the other night. You thought l was too sick to remember? Tell'em you did it, Rome. Don't go with this on your soul. l remember. 'Tu berbanti'. Wait, Marty. Go ahead, get out. Get out, you crook. l know you work for Whitey Leggett. You think l lie and count my fingers? You think l'll take a rap for you? Go confess yourself. Don't get excited, Marty. l'm sorry. l shouldn't have tried to pull that on you. Be practical, my friend. You're going to the chair anyway. You killed a cop. You can't beat that. -Get out! Homicide is beginning to think you and your girl did the job. l got no girls, Niles. Of course, you haven't. What would you think of 10,000 dollars? lf you had a girl,... ...10,000 would take her a long way. You haven't... ...so we'll give it to you mother. Think of it, Marty. ...for a lines that don't mean anything to you. That cop is going to throw you out. -They're looking for her. Looking hard. -Let'em look. She must be beautiful, Marty. You always could pick them. Dark, l bet... ...with a face like a Madonna. Niles... -Young, too. You better knock off that yapping. The police can't find her... ...but maybe we can... ...and make the police believe she did it. They might not... ...the way she is now... ...but if we worked on her for a few days... ...maybe she wouldn't be sure herself,... ...or she wouldn't look the same. Even you wouldn't recognize her. Maybe she wouldn't be... You pig! l'll tear your dirty tongue out! Nurse! Nurse! He tried to kill me. Tina. Tina. Sedative. -Tina. Tina. Tina. Tina. Tina. You'll find the figures correct. -Certainly. The cash balance is 37.83 dollars. Ten,... ...twenty, thirty, thirty five,... ...thirty six,... ...thirty seven. l took 8 cents for carfare the last time. Please. 'Prego'. 'Fratello',... ...the Society has instructed me as the president... ...to thank you for the honourable services... ...that you rendered to our organization. We hope... Well, we hope sometime,... Mario,... ...my dear friend,... ...l'm very sorry. Mama! Mama! Mama! Policeman! Blackberries! Brother, l'm sorry about what happened... ...this evening. lt isn't my fault. -Lieutenant Candella. Hello. This way, please. Hi. -Hello, Candela. Vaseli. l'll be back in a minute. Won't you be seated? -Thanks, l'll stay for a minutes. 'S'accomoda un minuto'. You keep company to the Lieutenant Candella. l will only take off my apron. Mama, you shouldn't have done that. You drink first. How is Martino? He's all right. They moved him from the hospital today. Moved? -Yes, to prison. Vittorio,... ...what will they do to him? Well, first he'll be tried. Then,... ...l don't know. Then? You know perfectly well that he killed a policeman. Yes. l can't understand why he did it. Martino was always such a good boy. He sent me money every week. Sure he sent you money, Mama. But how did he send you money? What kind of work did he do? l don't know. l don't know. Martino is very smart, you know. Very smart boy. -Very smart. But he should have married and settle down. Yes. Didn't he have a girl? Sure. Angelica Norelli. l made a contract with her father, Norelli. But... Any other girl? -No, no other girls. He liked Carmen Domingo. -Perdita! He told me so. Well, l think l'll be getting along. Just one minute, Lieutenant Candella. Vittorio, please, tell me something. What they going to do to him? You think Martino... -Mama,... ...that snoopy Candella's in the neighbourhood. Don't tell him that. Hello, Tony. Don't tell him what? Don't tell you nothing, copper. Antonio! You talk polite to the police. 'Sousi, Vittorio, quello e un ragazzo'. Lieutenant,... ...will you see Martino? Well, l hadn't... ...planned to. Please,... ...you give him this for me. -Well, Mama, l... Please. Okay, l'll give it to him. -Thank you. Thank you. 'E la madre, sai'. Just a minute, Mama. Did you put a saw in it? A little hot soup. And you tell him we all love him. Please, Vittorio, will you? Goodbye, Mama. You don't like it? lt's fine, Mr. Ledbetter. When do you change the sheets Decoration Day? You want'em changed you got to pay. How much? -A deuce. l'll give you a buck. Two. l'll talk to the night man. Okay, wise guy, a buck. All right, you mallet-head, what're you doing? Get moving! Crazy old cluck. Mallet-head cluck. Who's he think he's talking to? Every day he tells me that. Don't let him bother you he's a big boob. That's right big boob. Call me a cluck. Are you Martin Rome? Yeah. -You killed a cop? l'm Orvy, l'm a trusty. Hello, Orvy. Want to break out of here? What? -Break out. lt's easy. This ain't no prison... ...just a plain old hospital. You break out, then Ledbetter gets blamed and they throw him out. They throw him out. lt's kind of tough, isn't it? lt's nothing. You can do it, Marty. Look. How does it work? l'll show you. l been here three months. They don't know l know that. Wait till l get my keys, Lieutenant. Look it, Orvy! l'll only be a few minutes. Take your time, Lieutenant. l'll leave the door open for you. -Thanks. Some soup from your mother. Mama. How is she? How do you think? Yeah. How's Papa and the kids? -Okay. l saw your brother, Tony. He's a great boy. Yeah. l beat he told you where to head in. Great boy. He thinks you're a hero, Marty. l'll be chasing him, too. Maybe. He'll have plenty of fun first. Do you think it's worth it? How much money you make? Ninety four dollars and forty three cents a week. Ninety four dollars and forty-three cents, don't go far. Ever go to Florida for a couple of weeks? Or bet 100 bucks on a horse? Or give a girl a big bunch of orchids... ...because you like her smile? -No, but l sleep good nights. ln some cheap room. Not me. l had enough of that when l'm a kid. Crummy tenements, no food, no clothes. Save it for the jury. Who do you think you're kidding? l was brought up in the district, too. l've heard that dialogue ever since l was ten. Get hep... ...only suckers work... ...don't be a square, stay with the smart money... ...let the old man get calluses digging ditches... ...no food, no clothes, crummy tenements. You're breaking my heart, Marty. You played it your way, l played it mine. Think it's worth the chair? l don't know. l haven't tried yet. Maybe you won't mind. You'd be the center of attention. Me, l'd kind of think of afterwards. When they slide that pine box through the back door... ...and somebody has to identify it before they take it away. l do what l do, l get the chair. Nobody else. What about the girl? What about... You mean the angel? You haven't found her yet? -No. You look a long time. -Stop clowning, look. l'll play square with you. lf you're shielding an innocent girl, tell me who she is. lf her story agrees with yours l'll call the dogs off. There's no girl, Candella. Okay. l'll have to keep on looking. lt's kind of dull work. You certainly picked some pips. What do you mean? How about this little number, Constancia Lopez? Well... -And Brenda Margingale. Brother! She's not so young anymore. -And Maria,... ...Helen,... ...Patricia,... ...Rachel,... ...Rosarita... Rosarita! lf she were on a job they'd hear you in New ark. Yeah. One of them may be the one l want. You're crazy. Maybe. Guard! Coming up, Lieutenant. Then, there's Elena, Andrea,... ...and Tina. Tina Riconti. Know her, Marty? l don't know any Tina. l will. l'll tell you about her. Orvy! Orvy! Orvy! l got to get out. Now. Give me that spoon. No, Marty, not now. You can't make it. l got it all timed. - When? Well,... ...let's see, tomorrow. -Tomorrow? l can't wait. Maybe Ledbetter won't be here tomorrow... ...and they can't blame him. Yeah, maybe. That's right, look. l bring your tray for lunch at 11 :00. l got to fix it so you got a pass. A pass will be at the desk. -Yeah. ln the name of... ...Tony Guarino. -Tony Guarino. Are you sure this'll work? Sure. l've been working on it. Orvy! l told you what would happen if you wasted time. Get your bucket and get out of here. Mr. Ledbetter. -What? The guy in number four. -Yeah? l think he wants to make a deal for'em cigars. Orvy! Sure this'll work? -Sure. You can't miss. Go like l said. -How about the pass? lt's there. Honest. Don't forget. Tony Guarino. lf you trick me... -No, Marty, no. They don't figure a guy tries to break out of here. Why haven't you tried? l ain't got it any more... ...bum ticker. l tried it once, honest... ...but she just goes... You ain't scared like that, are you? No. Get out, leave me alone. Come on, come on, get the lead out. Marty, come on. You got a few minutes. Come on. -Shut up! Visitor? You were supposed to be out at 11 :00. Name? Tony Guarino. Brother? Who wrote this for you? Must be a new guy downstairs. He writes like a 3 years old. Sign here. Turn this pass in at the end of the tunnel. You coming, Ledbetter? Yeah. Wait a minute, l forgot my keys. l should wait for that joker. First visit? First time here, isn't it? -Yeah. l can tell there's something about a guy's first time... ...nervous or something. l suppose so. Just a minute. Yeah. Just a minute and l'll look it up. He's in there. We checked it. -And? About ten minutes ago he asked for Tina Riconti. Then he went up. -Are the exits covered? By the best men in the precinct. -Good. A dame on the 2nd floor will give us a pitch when he leaves. Let's go in and get him. That's it, He's coming out. Have the boys take him now? -Wait. That's his kid brother Tony. l'd to know he'd do something like this. Looks he's coming in here. Jim. Watch him. He knows me. -Right. Mr. Angelo, please. lt's for you. Thanks. Yeah. Okay, l got it, l'll see you later. 'Arriverderci'. A piece of paper, Tony. What're you doing, try to kill me? -Be quiet. 'Algonquin 5-502'. There's a number missing. What's it? Even if l remembered l wouldn't tell. l don't know. -Call them all, Jim. l want a report on that building. -Right. How about this? Take him home. Have his Mama spank him. Algonquin, 550 what? He should be here any minute. That's all right. l want him to sign these papers so l can go to lunch. l'm really surprised he's so late. l'll sign'em and we'll both go to lunch. l'm sorry l'm late, Vera. l wanted to talk to the Judge. Any calls? Nothing important. Mr. Angelo's been waiting. Yes. Mr. Angelo. Come right in. Mr. Niles. Yes? -Will you sign these letters now? l'll only be a few minutes. Surprised, Mr. Niles? A little. But you're a pretty fast worker. Push back a little, Niles. There're many buttons there. Listen, Marty. Don't came in here and get tough. l do business with your kind every day. Tough? Who wants to get tough? This is business. You come to the hospital to see me, l come to see you. That... ...business about your girl. You know that was just a bluff. -Sure. Just a bluff. That was a good deal you made me. l think l sign that confession. That was only good while the cops had you. Not good now? lt's too bad. Then you'd just better loan it to me. Loan it to you? l got no money. l... Well. l don't keep that kind of money here. But if this will help... Maybe you got more in the safe? No. l never keep cash in the office. Let's open it and see. Let's stop this nonsense, Rome. l've given... You! Listen, you! Let's open it. There're only legal papers. Okay. Let's take a look. See? Take them out. Bring it here. Why you. No. Open it. l haven't the key. -Come on, open it. The de Grazia's jewels. Now l think we'll talk. Whitey Leggett and the girl you ran the job. Who was the girl? l don't know anything. -Niles. l killed a policeman. l kill you, it makes no difference. -Marty, no. Who was the girl? Some friend of Whitey's. From a show business. l don't know. -What was the name? l didn't even know her. -What was the name? Rose. Rose Given... ...something like that. Marty,... ...dinner is ready. Your leg hurts badly? Yeah, pretty bad. l'd better fix it... -Wait a minute. You better eat first. l go on the corner to the drugstore. Tell him to get out before l come back. 'As petta un momento'. -This is my house. l got to fix my leg, Mama. Get me some bandages, 'unguento'... ...and a clean shirt. Yes. l'll cut off your bandages. -Never mind, Mama. l'll do it later. Marty,... ...why do you do these things? You get going on something like this, you can't stop. Yeah. First a policeman and now... ...they say you killed another man today. ls this true, Marty? Yeah. l had to kill him. Why? Why you must to kill? Why? l can't understand. You Marty, my first. 'll mio bambino piu buono'. The one who send me money. The one l pray. Why you must to kill? -Mama, don't! l loved you, more than the rest of'em. You were my first. You never told me where the money comes from. l didn't ask. That was my fault. l knew, in here l knew... ...but l didn't ask. That was my sin. -lt's not you, l... l did it for a girl. -Sure, Marty. With you it's always a girl. Tina is different. Can't you believe that? l love her. -No. You don't love her. You have no feelings for the people. You only care for Marty. Mama,... ...do you believe that l love you? You must believe that l love this girl. She is my life. She's good and she's beautiful. When a man tells me that he'll hurt her... ...l must kill him. Understand? -No. Love l know. Love that has to come through killing cannot last. l tell you... -l tell you! l tell you cannot kill! l tell you you're bad. -All right. l did it. So what? You can't bring a man back to life. l'm so tired. l'm so cold and my leg hurts. l've got to sleep and rest. l'll get your coat, Marty,... ...the heavy one. l tell you, l got to sleep here. l'll bring you coat. Because he said... -This is my home too. There are other children. You must go, Marty. l'll bring you food and you will go. lt's Tony. How about that flatfoot? He's walking in circles. -What about Tina? A dame came and took her away two days ago. No address, no nothing. How did the woman look? l don't know. Kind of heavy and tall and... ...middle-aged... ...a blue cape, l think the landlady said. What's the matter? ls that okay? lt's okay, Tony. Good boy. Get the scissors, cut the bandage. -Yeah. Lieutenant Candella! This way, please. Hello, Mama Roma. l didn't expect you. Won't you be seated? Let's sit in the kitchen, Mama. lt's so much warmer there. Besides, it smells so good. lf you sit here l'll bring you anything you like. Minestrone. That smells wonderful. -'Buono, ma freddo'. l prepared it for Tony but he's not home yet. Sit down. l'll give you a nice hot bowl of soup. l want to see Tony, Mama. l think l should talk to him. Why sure. Sure. Has he been bad? No, not really bad,... ...not yet. lsn't that his cap? Why... Yeah, Tony's cap. That boy always goes out without a hat. Here, good and hot. l'm sorry, l've got to look around. -Don't move. Put your hands on the table. Stand away, Mama. Tony! Get his gun. Stay where you are, Tony. We won't be any shooting while Mama's here. l'm disappointed in you, Marty. You're a big boy now. You're a pretty funny fellow. You don't think l'll shoot. Just make a move, Candella, we see. So that's your hero, Tony? He breaks out of jail, fools the cops... ...talks big with a gun in his hand. Look at him, Tony. His leg shot full of holes,... ...fever going up,... ...no place to go, no place to sleep... ...just run, run, until he can't run any more. Escape. Escape to where? Look at him, Tony. He's a dead man. Make an ltalian a cop he's got to make a speech. Okay, Candella. Maybe you catch me, maybe you don't. 'Arriverderci'. l'm sorry, Mama. You big, stupid cop. Now you got her crying. lt'll be better if she cries for one of you. Yeah? Well he got away, Copper. He won't go far. Sit down. l want to talk to you. Sit down! l found it, Marty. Here. What's the matter, Marty? l fell asleep. l found her. Madame Rose. Good girl. Take me up there. l can't keep driving. They'll catch us. They'll pinch me with you. Take me to Rose Given. -No. You said l could go when l found her. You promised me. Marty! What's the matter? Marty, don't, you'll get us both in an awful mess. Marty! What am l going to do? Drive,... ...we cannot stay here. ls it bad? ls he going to die? l don't know. Keep quiet. Just drive. l can't just drive. Somebody will see us. l have no license to practice. We cannot stop. You must drive, l'm sorry. These are bullet wounds. He didn't tell me. l was scared you wasn't going to come. lt is against the law whatever l do. But this... ...will cost you more. l need money, 200. l don't care, he's got it. He has torn these wounds by moving. They faster. He must be in bed. Can you fix him? -Only for a short time. He must get treatment,... ...and must have light. Quickly, pull in! But l can't. They'll see us. Pull in. Do you want him to die? Pull in somewhere. Come back here. What shall l do? Open his collar. l don't have any brandy. My wife is sick. l gave it and forgot it. l need some spirits. Spirits? Whisky, brandy, anything, quick, hurry. All right. Drop dead. Doc, will you please hurry? Please. There you are. Why don't you be a nice boy and beat it? That's no way to talk to a fellow. Did your boy friend pass out? You're a little overtrained. Why don't you go away before l get angry? All l want to do is help... ...if the guy is folded up. Look, honey, you really want to help me? l left my purse in the bar. Why don't you get it? Delighted. Anything to be of service to a lady. How is he? He's all right for the time being. Money. ...200. What am l going to do with him, Doc? Good night. What did you say you lost? Thanks, Brenda. You won't faint again. -No, l'll be all right. l'll get in touch with you. l'm sorry, we're closed. You Rose Given? Got to talk to you. l said we were... You're Martin Rome. Come in. My apartment's in back. You wanted to talk to me Martin. Say it quickly, the police may be after you. l think we can do business. l don't think so. Yes, we can. You were in on the de Grazia case with Leggett. That's ridiculous. You ought to know better than to walk in here and try to bluff me. l'm glad you killed him, Martin. He was a bad man. Very bad. He shouldn't have told you that about me. He wasn't so bad. He gave me the de Grazia jewels. How do l know? Pearl choker with a ruby pendant,... ...seven rings,... ...diamond bracelet with the clasp broken. You must have been in a hurry. Where are they? ln a locker in a subway station. You got them once, you may want them again. You're a cute little man, Martin. l should have worked with you instead of Leggett. Some day you can't tell. How much do you want for the jewels? A car, 5,000 dollars, a way out of the country and a good night sleep. That's a big order. -lt's a lot of jewels. l can take'em some place else. l could get you the car. ...maybe 2,000. -5,000. But how can l get you cut of the country? How were you going to get out? Or were you going to declare it on your income tax? All right, Martin. South America suit you? Any place but the Canal one. Let's get the jewels. Yeah. No. No, l can't, not till tomorrow. Tonight l've got to sleep. lf l can. That's right, Martin. Relax. Here. l'll show you something. That's wonderful. lt is good, isn't it? l have the touch... ...it's only given to a few. lt's a matter of knowing the currents of the body. And l waste this on fat old women... ...who think they can lose weight and be beautiful again. Fat old women who have... ...too much money and too many jewels. He think the jewels make'em beautiful... ...and they fight to keep'em like they fight the years... ...that make them ugly. Give me the key to the locker. Do you think l'd bring it with me? No. l suppose not. You are too smart for that. Here. Lie down and rest awhile. l'll get you a blanket. Cream and sugar? Black both of them. For the love of Pete, it's four o'clock. Jim, why don't you go on home? lt's just a job... ...we'll get him, we can't miss. l want to get him too. He's only been out a day and you're making a vendetta out of it. You saw his kid brother today. He thinks it's a big game. They all do. They got an idea a cop is somebody who chases kids... ...and they make a Robin Hood out of a cheap hoodlum like that. The longer he's loose, the bigger hero he is. Okay. Let's face it, we ain't Sherlock Holmeses. This is a big town, we got to sit tight and wait. Staying up all night ain't going to help it. Say lady, why do you stay up all night? l beg your pardon. Okay, no offense,... ...just wondered why you weren't asleep. He's out there somewhere... ...in an alley,... ...on a roof... ...looking for a way out. He's not asleep. Eat, Martin. You need the strength. -Not in the morning. Let's get going. lt's only 8:55. The banks aren't open yet. Have some coffee. lt's good. You got a touch for that too? Yeah, l like to cook. l wanted those jewels so l could get a place in the country. Fresh eggs every day,... ...milk,... ...cream... -Stop it! When'll you get the money and the tickets? A half. Then get them. Meet me at 22nd Street and Fourth Avenue in 45 minutes. And don't forget,.. ...5,000. Certainly, Martin. See that you don't lose the key to that locker. And don't use the front door. l wouldn't want to give the place a bad name. lf l knew he was going to kill l wouldn't shown him. l wouldn't. -You lying a little. Shut up, Ledbetter. Orvy. Did he say where he was going or anyone he was going to see? Nothing, Lieutenant. Honest, if l knew, l'd tell you. Will they give me more time for this? Will they give me more time? l'm afraid. -They ought to give you life. Jim. -Yeah. Find anything? -Nothing. What's this? Stuff on the dames. -What? lt's a report on Rome's dames. We got all those doctors ready. Do you like to play long shots? Bring Sullivan with you. This is costing my job. lsn't there something you can do? You were in charge. There's nothing anybody can do. Come on, Sullivan. So long, cluck. l want to help you guys as much as l can. Let's go. -But l've a job... ...l'm late, the boss doesn't like. -Okay. l'll write you a note and give you an apple for him. At 2:30 this morning, in a car on 54th Street... ...a man with four bullet wounds... ...received emergency medical treatment. A licensed physician in this city... ...is bound to report such treatment to the police. Look, if l am permitted... ...l speak for my colleagues. We're doctors, yes, but... l know, Doctor. l don't like this any more than you do. l realize that certain of you gentleman... ...have high reputations in your own countries. However, you're not licensed to practice here... ...and this is a murder case. Mr. Sullivan. Do you recognize any of these gentlemen? Turn around. l don't think so. Rome l'm sure of, but the other was in the shadows. Well,... ...l'd had a couple. -Yeah, yeah. l must ask you all to show me your wallets. May l be permitted to say, sir,... ...that this is very humiliating? l'm very sorry, Doctor, but l must do it. Where did you get this money? l... Well, l work. Doctor,... ...this money came from the safe of Arthur Niles. The Lawyer that Martin Rome killed yesterday. Lieutenant... ...l didn't know he is a murderer... l only... Come with me, Doctor. Jim, let the rest go. Over here, Doctor. Are you ready to tell me about it? l don't know anything about this man. l treat him, they pay me,... ...that's all. What about the girl? The girl... l don't know her. l never ask for names. She's blonde. My wife, Lieutenant,... ...she is sick. We need money. Otherwise l would never do... -l'm sorry. Sign this. They put me in jail? You knew it was against the law. We must. Paul. My wife, Lieutenant. -We'll do all we can. Thanks. Holy smokes! Police headquarters. We just got the report on Tina Riconti. Two people saw a woman take her out of the apartment. Middle aged, tall. Did they get Brenda? Give'em a chance. They got the call ten minutes ago. Middle aged, tall, blonde, a little heavy... Candella. Homicide. Yeah. Hello, Marty. Where're you? -Trace the call. Don't trace the call, Candella. l won't be here. What's on your mind? l call you up to give you a big promotion. That's very nice of you. Don't get sarcastic. l'm doing you a favour. l'm giving you the woman in the de Grazia case. You can pick up her in 20 minutes at 18 Street Subway station. She'll be opening a locker. Aren't you going to thank me? No? 'Arriverderci'. Marty, Marty... Call and get somebody on that subway platform. Believe him? -Sure. That's why he killed Niles. Come on. We'll have'em radio us that tracer call. Here it is. The key, Martin. The ticket and the money. lt's the Star of Asia leaving Key West on Friday. You leave tonight... ...you'll have plenty of time. -Give me that! First we get the jewels. Get out. l wouldn't want any monkey business. Get out. You're crazy. l'll be spotted down there. Get out. Walk ahead of me and don't try to get smart. You're crazy. l'll be caught down there. Where's the locker? Don't try anything funny. You're under arrest, lady. Why, the double-crossing... Let me go! Let me go. l didn't have anything to do with it! l'll kill him! l'll kill him! Five o'clock should be all right. Lieutenant Candella? Speak to the floor nurse right there. Yes? l'm Lieutenant Collins. Homicide. l understand Candella's asking for me. Asking for you? He nearly yelled the building down. We had to get the interns in to administer a sedative. He don't know when he's well off. l'd like to be in that bed. How is he? He lost a lot of blood, and they'd to probe pretty deeply. He'll be all right. He's probably still sleeping. We'd to give him a heavy shot. You don't need one. -Sorry. Lieutenant. Lieutenant Candella. Lieutenant! Why, he's gone! What do you mean, gone? His clothes, l... His hat's here but... That crazy, when did you check him last? -That's an hour ago! Holy smoke! He couldn't walk out of here. He didn't have the strength! -He didn't? You're lucky he didn't go out through that wall. Hello. Hello! Police headquarters. What time is it? You asked me that four times. -Mother, would you just... ...tell me what time it is. lf you're going to adopt that... ...tone... -Mother,... ...l've been on my feet all day at the hospital... ...and l'm in no mood to argue. lf l'm getting to be a burden to you. l can always leave. She's back! There're homes for people like me and l can... Tina... ...Tina Riconti. Where's she? l don't know what you're talking about. You're the one that could know where is she. Listen, Lieutenant. l knew no good would come of bringing her here. Mother! She's been nothing but trouble ever since she came... ...taking my room. -All right. So l did have her here. But she doesn't know anything about the robbery. Look, Miss Pruett,... ...Rome's a murderer. Tina's his girl. lf you want to see her alive... -But... ...l told her not to go. l begged her. But Tony said he needed her. Tony? -Yes. He said Marty was hurt and wanted to see her just once more. He said she'd to come. Where? At church somewhere, he said. A church? -He'd to hide until... ...it got dark. -Church? She's inside. -Good boy. l'll need you to drive. l'm taking you with me. l don't think l ought to... What's the matter? That cop scare you? We need money and fast. You know where Mama keep it in the Kitchen? l can't take that. -Why not? lt's all they've got! So what. l gave it to'em, didn't l? l need it. Get it and get back in ten minutes. Get it and don't waste any time. Yes. But l had to see you. l knew you wouldn't let me down. We're living. Both of us. l'm taking you with me. No, Marty, no. l got my car outside. We'll go, nobody can stop us. ln a few days we can be out of the country. We'll go away some place and nobody will ever find us. Marty, l... l can't. There's nothing to be afraid of. They're not after you. l fixed that. lt isn't that, Marty. lt's you. You've changed. Changed? Why? Because of Niles? He threatened you. l had to. But the policeman. That was self defense. Don't think about it. lt's past. Go away and forget all about it. We'll get out of this crummy town. We love each other, Tina. We can be happy, you know we can. Marty, l... l can't. lt isn't right. l can't. Don't dear. lt's all right, l understand. l shouldn't have asked you. lt's just that you're the only one left. The rest don't count. Even my mother turned me out. But you, Tina,... ...l've kept you in my heart always. Wherever l went you were my strength. Without you l'm empty,... ...finished, dead. Please, Marty. Don't torture me. -Then come with me. You're my life. l'll do anything in the world for you. Come. -No, don't go with him. You won't need that, l came alone. She only nicked you. That's too bad. l'm going out of here and she's coming with me. You maybe, Marty, but not the girl. Not when she knows about you. She knows about me. And she's coming with me. You told her, heh? A confession. This is a good place. You told her everything? Yeah. She knows. That you killed two men. But does she know about the others? Does she know about Orvy, the trusty... ...who'll get five years for helping you break jail? Does she know about Brenda,... ...the girl that sheltered you? She'll serve time, Marty. So will that Doctor with the sick wife. You forgot all about them, didn't you? No, he didn't forget them. He didn't even think of them. He used them and brushed them aside just like he used everybody he's ever known... ...including his own family. And he'll use you too, if he has to. You lie, Candella. -Do l? He says that he loves you. Maybe he does... ...as much as he could love anybody. But if he really loved you... ...would he ask you to share the kind of life he's got to live? The law doesn't want you, Tina Riconti. Go home. Tina! Not you, Marty. You're going with me. You want to die, Candella. Here. Now. l warn you, Rome. l've got a gun, too. l've been lucky. l've never had to kill a man in my life. But l'll get you, Rome. l'll get you because l've got to. You're bluffing. You got no gun. Go ahead. Call my bluff. You'd shoot? Here in church? l think l'd be forgiven this time. Your gun, Marty. Days l wasted, l could have been out of the country. Next time l know better. There won't be any next time. Your gun. You're bleeding, Candella. You sprung a leak? l'm all right. Let's go. She hurt you goo, Candella? Let's go. -No. You ought to sit down. Rest a while. ln the name of the law, Rome... ...stop! He's dead. l wanted to tell him l couldn't bring the money. He send me home to get it. l couldn't take it. l wanted to tell him. Help me, Tony.
