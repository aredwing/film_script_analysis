Have you been keepin' it tight for me? Yo! Hurry up off the phone, nigga! Wait. Hold on a second, B. Did you hear what I just said? What the fuck? I'm talkin' to you, nigga. Oh, shit! Yo! Oh!

Fucked up. You know I'm fucked up over this shit, too, B. I murdered them niggas who did that shit to Mitch, B. I'm trying to find out. I haven't found any of the damn keys in that building with Mitch. Keys? Yeah, I gave Mitch a set of keys to get Sonny back, man. I know he had the fuckin' keys in there with him, man. Now, you know, I got to get the money or the keys, man, To pay this connect back with. Hey, yo, B., why you ain't callin' me on that shit, B.? You know I would have went with that nigga Mitch and made that shit happen for you, ay. I know, I know, man. That's on me. I fucked up. You talk to Mitch yesterday?

I ain't tape that shit last night, B. I kept another set of keys, understand? To sell for when the ransom was paid. Now, look, the way shit is now, man, It's too hot out on the streets for me to be caught with myself trying to go out there and conduct something. I'm gonna need you to do me this. I want you to sell these keys for me. Give me the money, I can pay it to the connect. You know what I'm sayin'? Then I take you in there, introduce you to the connect. So you want me to sell all the keys? Yeah. It's like this. I been talking to these kids from out of town who say, you know, they'd take these keys-- Buy them at a higher price than what's goin'. You understand what I'm sayin'? So, you know, all you got to do is sell them. Then you take the extra cheese off the top. You understand what I'm sayin'? Then I can walk away. We all can walk away set. And you're cool with that? I'm cool. I'm cool with that. I don't believe you, A. I mean, you gonna give up all this shit? About how much? Yeah, nigga. I said I was going.

And I gave him the number of fake-ass dealers who turned out to be the feds. See, I knew Rico's greed would destroy him and set me free. I'm sure that he would say I went out like a punk. But fuck it. It's a price I could live with. I don't like the motherfucker anyway. I did it. 25 to life-- I did that. Rico can't live with that. I ain't snitchin' on nobody from Harlem, man. I'll give you a couple cats down in D.C. doing they thing out of town, doing they thing, but, um, I'm not snitchin' on nobody in Harlem 'cause when I come home, I'm still gonna be the King. Meanwhile, Janet sat by the phone, but no more calls came. Mitch had it right about Ice. His uncle was the one not looking out for family. His bitterness towards his nephew Mitch was taken out on his other nephew Sonny. His own blood. Tommy did Ice's dirty work. When the ransom money didn't come, he killed Sonny. The game was over. All right, you know what I'm sayin'? Now there's a new game. Us old players are gone. But you can see our story on music videos with prop guns and fake champagne. I guess you don't have to be somebody no more. I guess you can just front like you somebody you ain't. I have a family. Lulu's bag of diamonds made a down payment on a new life. As my man Mitch would say, "Life is good." Maybe I will be the George Jefferson of the neighborhood. I'll get back to you on that. Like "what?" looking down here like-- Look at the world like down here like "what? Money, money. Action! Battle physically. Conquer mentally. Battle physically. Conquer mentally. Battle physically. Conquer mentally.
