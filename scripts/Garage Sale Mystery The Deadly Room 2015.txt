[] Asking is $3 million, So that will be A very nice commission. This is great! Mm-hmm. Are you sure you're Not in the market? You sold us The house we just bought! Don't be greedy. This house will make me Number-one agent And, hopefully, a partner. The owner did A ground-up restoration. This place has not been Touched in 40 years. I remember Driving by, thinking, "What a scary Old wreck." Well, fortunately For this old girl, Her bones are Made of redwood, And that lasts forever. Over here. Okay. So, check this out. Now, this room Used to be smaller. There was a wall Right there, And they Knocked it out, And they found Another room behind it. A sealed room? Mm. That's creepy. Why would Someone do that? Actually, it's not uncommon In these big houses. When you reduce The size of the room, It makes it A lot easier to heat. Oh. Well, The place looks great, And the open house Sounds fun. More like a party. We have waiters In period costumes, Food, drink. Jason's coming, right? Mm-hmm. And you should ask Dani. If she has a date, She can bring him, too. Great. What about you? Are you gonna bring a date? Oh, you know me, Jenn. Married to my job. But you never know Who might show up. [] Okay. Why does Somebody bring Something Into the store? Because they want to Sell it? Exactly! And we are here To help them succeed. While making money For the store-- Through the art Of negotiation. Aim high. Expect The best outcome. Now, if You're selling, You ask for more Than you expect to get. Ah, but if You're buying-- Offer less Then you're willing to pay? Ahh! Where did you Learn this stuff? Oh, I have kids. I negotiate Every day of my life. Okay, so Im here alone, And someone brings in A beautiful, Hand-painted jewellery box, And they're asking A hundred bucks for it. You offer? Mm... 10 bucks. Apple doesn't fall Far from the tree. That's my girl! -yay! -whoo! [] "Morp" dance? It's "prom" Spelled backwards. Girl-ask-boy. Oh, that's clever. Yeah. I think he's worried That a girl named Amy Is gonna ask him. Hmm. Funny. In my day, they called it A "Sadie Hawkins." You went to a girl-ask-boy? Mm-hmm. Who'd you ask? Captain of the football team. Really? And where is he now? Not sure. Used to play For the Dallas cowboys. [Game guns blasting In headphones] [Knocks] You've been Talking to dad. Well, I usually talk to dad. The dance sounds like fun. Okay, one, I don't dance. Two, it's a girl-ask-boy, Which is lame, And three-- Not interested. Hmm. Did someone asked you? Nope. Hope it stays that way. This is a tough age. [Adrian]: well, then Don't bring a date. Just come. You're both Coming, right? Oh, yes. Me, Jason and Hannah. Me and me. [Laughs] Oh! Oh...

Well, Im working The nibbles. Wonderful-- This is A nice house. Built 1890s? Very good. 1884. Gustav Carson. He owned the lumber mill. Eventually, They ran out of wood, So they fell on hard times. The current owner Has done a great job With the restoration. It's just beautiful. Mm-hmm. Erica franklin. She flips A lot of properties, But this one, she really Sank a lot of money into.

What do you do That you could afford A place like this? I play on-line poker. See, I log on through A computer in Portugal. The site thinks Im there. I thought that was illegal. As long As you don't get caught. Hmm. Can I show you upstairs? I saw it, but thanks. I've gotta run. You know I wanted to Buy this place and tear it down? Yes, I do.

You're actually gonna Sell the place tonight? Oh, no! No, no. Let the dust settle. Maybe by the end of the week. There were some buyers That couldn't make it tonight, So we need them to feel That they missed out. [] Uh-oh. Troubles arrived. Who is that? That's my sister. Excuse me. Sure. What are you Doing here? Why don't you try And find our daughter, I'll go Get the car? Okay, honey. I'll see you outside. Usually I deal in fixers At a fraction of this price, But I fell in love With this house. It became a passion project. Oh, I can see why. [Chuckles And bonks head] Oh!

Yeah, every now and then. Okay. Thanks. [Bell jingles] [] [Sighs] [Phone rings] Hey, Adrian. What's up? Oh! I am so upset. Go online. Search "deadly room, The Carson house." this is really bad! Why? What's going on? look, I gotta go, but someone is saying the house is cursed! I'm doing damage control. I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay? [Exhales tensely] [Keys clacking] [] Oh, no. [Jennifer]: you saw it. It's an anonymous blog. Well, it worked! Scared me. Well, they did find A sealed room, But that doesn't mean The house is cursed, Or if you sleep there, You'll end up dead. I wouldn't buy The house. Would you? I get it. Someone's trying to Sabotage the sale. All three offers Have pulled. Aeek, People will forget about Some blog on the 'net. Oh, no. Not in real estate. A house gets this kind of rep, It sticks. No. I gotta get to The bottom of this. I am just so ticked off! Well, have there been Any deaths in the house? Is there any truth To the story? Well, it's an old house. I mean, people used to Die at home a hundred years ago. It doesn't mean The house killed them. Good point. So how do you prove that? I've been thinking about it, And I have an idea. I'm gonna spend the night there And, better than that, I'm gonna do a live webcam, So the whole world Can watch me while I sleep, And when Ill wake up In the morning, I'll be just fine. Ooh! You might want to get A new pair of PJs If the whole world's Gonna be watching. What? I'm just saying. [] You really think This is a good idea? [Adrian]: if we don't Squash this right now, Then we will never Get rid of it. Well, Im not sure I'm going to allow it. I think We take it off the market, Then relist it In a couple months, When the dust settles. It's your house, Erica, But let me tell you About a home A few years ago in Madison. The renters left, Claiming that it was haunted. It took four years to sell, At a 40% price drop. Well, good luck With your webcam. It better work. [Erica walks out] I've been shopping. Oh! You know, I don't Know if Id want The whole world watching Me while I sleep. That's because She snores like a horse. That's an exaggeration! Maybe a pony. [All chuckling] So, the live webcast, It's tonight? Yes. The show starts At 11:00 p.m. Sharp. Okay, let's see them. tah-dah! -whoa! -yeah. I think My Grammy has those. She's funny. [Laughing] [Man on TV] : press the button, you press it once. okay, that's 30 times, but-- [Woman on TV] : I think it's only supposed to be pressed twice. It's the big night, Right? Holy cow! Is it almost 11:00? Yeah. Where's my laptop? What did I do with it? -there. On the counter. -thank you. [Clicks television off] [Keys clacking] [Adrian exhales heavily] hi, everybody. if you are seeing this, then you are watching my live webcam from the so-called "deadly room," where you get to watch me sleep all night. how exciting. I have set my alarm for 7:30, and when that goes off, I will wake up, wave to the camera, and that will be the end of this nonsense. so... I will see you then. and I will be in the office shortly after 9:00. any offers on the house can happen after that. okay? Goodnight. [Jenn chuckles] Gripping. -mm. -Im going to bed. See you up there. Goodnight. Hey, dani. Are you watching? [Dani] : yep. Her head moved. did you see it? Very exciting. Call me If she rolls over. [Both chuckling] -alright, sweet dreams. -you too! Hey. Can I see? I think I'm gonna do that. Go on a live webcam? No. Go to sleep. -funny. Goodnight. -goodnight. [Birds singing] OH... Oh. Well... Did the deadly room Strike? Oh. Let's see. Should be waking up any moment. [Adrians alarm clock chiming] [alarm continues] How come she's not moving? The alarm Is right next to her bed. [Alarm chiming] [] [Responder radios crackling, Overlapping chatter] Frank! Frank, what happened? [Sighing] I don't know. First responders Found her unconscious, Unresponsive. Seems she'd been dead A few hours already. How? She had a camera On her all night. I'm not a medical examiner, So don't quote me on this-- There's no sign of trauma, No blood. Appears to be A natural death. A healthy young woman Goes to sleep And she just doesn't wake up? I asked exactly The same thing. Seems it's a lot more common Than you think. Heart attack, And blood clot-- Any number of possibilities. [Sighs] Oh, come on, frank. Do not go there. We're gonna get the autopsy Reports back in a couple days, And then we'll know. May I go inside? Yeah. We're all done here. Go ahead. [Door creaks] Erica. Can you believe this? No. I have the worst luck. I am, of course, Devastated about Adrian. It's shocking! [Phone keys clicking] Erica, do you mind If I go upstairs? I don't care. Go. [Phone keys clicking] [] [Shutter snaps] [Snap] [Snap] [] Did she have? Any family? Her parents Died years ago. Car accident. Her sister, Tina, Was at the open house. Did you see her? No. Was she ever married? Once. It's been over for years. He lives on the coast, No kids. You know, I had a friend-- Young, healthy, Died. It was an aneurysm. Mm. [Exhales] What? What are you thinking? Tch. It's nothing, really. When I saw Tina At the open house-- Uh-huh? She and Adrian Were off in a side room, Having a heated argument. [Sighs] come on, Jenn. Not everything is a mystery. Not every death Is a murder. [Sighs] [Doorbell jingles] [] Welcome To rags to riches. How can I help you? [] [] [Knocks] [Exhales nervously] Tina? I'm Jennifer Shannon. I was friends with your sister. I just wanted to come by And say Im sorry, And see if you're alright. Come on in. Thank you. Isn't that funny, How Adrian died? I mean, we're all gonna Die sometime, right? But on a live webcam? Wow. I don't think That was her intention. [Laughs] I guess not! I'm sorry, but... You seem a little... Untroubled? Not grieving properly? Well... Frankly, yes. Look. It's no secret I didn't like Adrian, And she didn't care much for me. I don't know How I feel. Maybe it'll hit me later. If you don't mind me asking, What happened Between the two of you? Well... A car crash happened. No more mom, no more dad. There was a trust fund. Adrian controlled it. So any time I wanted something, I had to go to her. Not cool. Did Adrian have Any health issues That would've contributed To her sudden death? She had to wear One of those heart halters A couple years ago. Irregular heartbeat, But nothing major. Seemed to go away on its own. I won't presume to understand Your relationship. I know that family Can be difficult Under the best Of circumstance, But at the end of the day, It's still family. I'm sorry for your loss. Thanks. I'm really not an evil person. Just honest. Hey, hon. Oh, hey, Sweetheart. Have you seen this? No. What is it? "Deadly house strikes again. "Curse of The old Carson house. "An internet story Told of the curse. "Real estate agent Adrian Merrill "Vowed to prove it false. "She slept in the house With a live webcam. In the morning, She was dead." This is horrible. You okay? Oh, yeah, I'm okay. None of it makes sense. I know That look in your eyes. Do you really think Someone might've Killed her? I don't know. I really don't know. Autopsy reports Came in this morning. Death by Natural causes. What did you think We'd find? Well, it's just... It's hard to believe, That's all. Listen, I have gone through The entire tape Of her sleeping. She never gets up, And no one Ever comes into the room. You mean, no one ever came Into view on camera. Fine. No one Is ever seen on camera. When they say "natural causes," What does that mean? It means "death not attributed To outside forces." Her heart stopped. This is not a police case. There are no suspects. Leave it be, Jenn. I hear you. Good. Could you do me A favour, though? Would you call the coroner, See if he'll talk to me? [Chuckles] Oh, here we go. [] [Peter]: Hi. Is Jennifer here? Oh, uh, she should be Back in a couple hours. Oh. Okay. I think she loaned something From the store For the open house Last Saturday. If you could please remind her To go by and pick it up. I think I saw you there. -peter Mullin. -Hannah. Hi. I work In the same office As Adrian... ...did. You must all be devastated. We are. It's tough Any time you lose a friend, But this... So... What happens to the house now? Well, the house is still there. It's gonna be a tough sell After this. I don't envy the next agent. Mm, people don't really Believe that "curse" story? You'd be surprised. We actually got a call At the office today. Someone says they remember A woman who died in the house Back in the 1960s. It was This big mystery-- She was young, In her 40s. Hmm. What do you think? I think... I think I'm glad I don't own the house. [] Have a good day. You too. [Chuckles] The perfect murder? In my opinion? No such thing. At least In the real world. The killer always Leaves some evidence, Always makes a mistake. And nothing About Adrian Merrills death Suggested anything But "natural causes"? Ah, yes. The "deadly room"-- Heh, I love that. No signs of trauma, No gunshot wounds, Knife wounds, et cetera, No bruising. Blood panels Negative for poisons. Estimated time of death Between 3:00 and 5:00 a.m., From her core temperature. Her heart just stopped. Why? Well, um, she had A history of mild tachycardia, That's an irregular heartbeat, And, looking at The medical records, Also had sleep apnea. The irregular heartbeat, The apnea, Or a combination of the two Could be linked To sudden cardiac death. Unfortunately, What we have here Is a 35-year-old woman Who died of natural causes. So that's it? That's it. The body is released. Private funeral. End of story. Ooh! Candy? [] Hey! Is this The "deadly room" house, The one that Killed that woman? No, it's not. That house is, um, A couple blocks down the road. Okay. Thanks. [] How long do We have to stay? No disrespect, But if Adrian were here, She'd want to leave. [] Hello. Good to see Someone I know. I have no idea Who most of these people are. We don't, either. I'm sorry to interrupt. Jennifer, Danielle, This is my boss, Patrick white. He owns the real estate firm Where Adrian worked. Nice to meet you. Well, Im so sorry to meet Under these circumstances. Adrian was a friend, As well as the best agent I ever had. This is a... Tragic loss. Can we have a moment? Excuse us. [Hushed conversations, Overlapping] Dani, check that out. Thanks. Thank you so much for coming. [Quietly]: Do I look the part? You look fine. I'd appreciate it If we kept that conversation We had the other day Between the two of us. Yes, of course. Do you guys sell? Used furniture? Yes, we deal mostly with Antiques and unique items. Great. 'Cause all this Is gonna go. I'm gonna be moving in To Adrians house, But I want A whole different vibe. I'll call you. [] Geez. I could Barely stand it! If it wasn't so obvious, I'd think That Tina killed her sister. What do you mean? Well, I think, If she was guilty of anything, She would have acted bereaved The last time I went to see her. She didn't care. Unless it was a double-fake And she thought that, By acting nonchalant, It would make her seem innocent Because on the surface, She'd look guilty. Possible. But... Guilty of what? Jenn, you went to the coroner. Nobody killed Adrian. [] [Gasps] Ive got it! Blow gun. The killer was off-camera With a poison dart, Blew through the long tube. And-- [smack] voila. I don't think so. No. Well, one, The dart would still be there. Or two, if the killer Went to retrieve it, We would see him on camera, Right? Yeah. And the poison would show up In an autopsy. How else could A killer have done this? I'm stumped. So, either she did Die of natural causes, Or... The house has a "deadly room" That kills people. Does it? How much do you really know About the house's history? [] [Gasps] May I help you? [takes a breath, chuckles] That house Has quite the reputation. When I was younger, We wouldn't even Trick-or-treat there. [Scoffs lightly] You certainly don't think The house somehow Kills people, do you? How it happens, I don't know. But there have been deaths. I've been told houses that old Have had deaths. Oh, that's it. Right there. Huh. And now The most recent one, The real estate Agent. You heard about that? [] [Clink] It was a "celebration Of life," It was at Adrian's house, But it really Wasn't a lot of fun. They never are. Tina is walking around Like the bereaved sister, And she isn't. That's harsh. Mm. Logan and I Were at the batting cage today. I brought up The dance, And he seemed A little callous about it. How? I asked him what he would say If Amy invited him. And he said, "Thank you, That sounds like fun, I'd love to"? No. It's was more like, "No way." Hmm. [Video playing] Hey. Whatcha doing? [Clicks video off] English homework And watching an old movie. It's amazing you can do both At the same time. It's called Multi-tasking, mom. What movie Are you watching? the sting. the sting? That's a classic. Hey, can we talk? Yeah, about what? I just want to Share something with you. Long ago, and far away, Your mother Was in high school And there was A girl-ask-boy dance, And there was a boy I really wanted to ask, But I couldn't Work up the courage. What if he didn't think I was Cool enough, or cute enough? Or what if he said no? It was very stressful. Anyway, one day I did Work up the courage to ask him, And to my surprise, He said yes. We didn't date after that, It was never a "thing," But we had a wonderful time, And I will always remember him For that. So I just want to say, If you are lucky enough To be asked, I hope you'll realize That it's not easy for the girl. That's all. [] Oh, no. You are not gonna Spend eight hours Watching Adrian Sleeping in bed. I thought it was A live-feed, anyway. What, did you Tape it? No, Logan helped me out. The live webcam was backed up In the cloud. I'm watching it At four times the normal speed. I should be done In two hours. What are you looking for? I don't know. Anything. A shadow? Something weird. [Sighs] pause it. [Clack] Can you tell me why Everyone else is wrong, And you suspect foul play In the death of Adrian? I went down to the library, To look through the records. There was a woman Who died in the house in 1895. Elizabeth Carson. William Carsons Great-great grandmother? There might be three "greats." Died of typhus. So not a deadly room? No. But the story Mentioned That the house was thought To be cursed. There were other deaths. But Adrian said, back then, It was common for people To die at home. I don't believe In a curse anyway. It's just too convenient. An anonymous article comes out About a "deadly room," And the one night That Adrian sleeps there, She dies? Mm. Well, if you're Thinking murder, You need a suspect And motive. I'm working on that. And a method. I mean... How do you kill someone when The world is watching live, There are No marks on the body, And the autopsy finds Nothing out of the ordinary? I'm working on that, too. Do I think She died of natural causes? Hard to believe. But the alternative is... It's ridiculous. Adrian was A good friend. Few years back, We were a team. One of the top producers. Why did you split? Well, the agency thought We'd be more productive Competing against each other, And we were. But we didn't have As much fun. When something like this Happens, Who profits? Well, not the owner-- Erica franklin. She's put a lot of money Into this project. The price of the house Has taken a big hit. How much? Who knows? But killing someone to get A better price on real estate, That seems a little extreme, Don't you think? I'm just Trying to figure out Who might gain By this situation. Hey, folks! One sec. Look, I have to admit I've had some of The same thoughts myself. I keep on coming up empty. [Sighs] If there's anything I can do to help, Please let me know. Thanks, peter. Hi. Peter Mullin. Pleasure. Nice to meet you. [Doorbell jingles] Oh! Welcome to rags to riches. Hi. I have A vintage silk flapper dress From the 1920s. Oh! Wow. That's stunning. I even have a picture Of my grandmother Wearing the dress. Oh... I love this. Well, I need to Sell it right away. It's really crazy, But little my doggy, He tore his acl, And the operation Is really expensive. Well, this dress would be Great for the store. Um, how much Did you want for it? Well, I don't really Want to sell it, But I feel like If I got $700 for it, That would be fair. Okay, well... Excuse me a second. Okay. [Keys clacking] [Quiet gasp] [Picks up phone] Mom? Why don't you ever Pick up your phone? [] I really like the dress, But I can't buy something That expensive without approval. Could you bring it back later? I-I really do Need to sell it today. I'll try another store. I could give you $300 for the dress. [Exhales] Five is really The lowest I can go. I mean, it is Vintage silk, beaded. Honestly, The most I have is 300, And I probably Shouldn't do that. [Sighing] Deal. [Giggles happily] Thank you so much. You're welcome. Oh, wow. No one wants to get near it. All offers have been pulled. Is it true? That Donald Lennox Had wanted to Tear the place down And build An apartment complex? Well, Donald wanted to buy it For practically nothing. I offered slightly more Than nothing, And I think Donald Was irritated with Adrian For letting me snatch it up. I heard William Carson Was interested in the house. He still is. You know he called me The day after Adrian's passing, Seeing if I wanted to "Unload" it. Offering me even less Than what I paid for it, Before the remodel. I know you consider yourself Some kind of sleuth-- At least that's what I hear. Doesn't really matter. "Deadly room," murder, It's all the same. My investment is wrecked. It may have Mattered to Adrian. Of course. She and I were in A business relationship, And that's what my mind Is on now-- The business. [] I'll be fine. Hey, sweetheart! How did it go? Went great. Do you notice anything new? I took your advice About going for it. Authentic silk flapper dress From the 1920s. How much? Well, I saw one Online for $1,500. The woman was trying to Get $700 out of me, But I drove a hard bargain And I got it for 300! We're gonna do okay! If-- if it's real. It's real! I have a photo Of her grandmother wearing it. [Sighs] Well, sweetheart, How do you know that That's her grandmother? How do you know That it's silk? Well... Feels like silk. The woman needed money To pay for an operation On her dog. Well... Ring? -mm. Real silk-- ...can be Pulled through a ring. Synthetic bunches up. So this dress is... Genuine... Rayon. But good rayon. It's worth about 25 bucks. [Sighs heavily] I'm so sorry. That was all a lie? The picture of her grandmother, The story about her dog? [She sighs] I've been conned. Oh, sweetheart. I'm sorry, mom. That's okay. We've all made The same mistake When we're starting out. Well, sure! That's how you learn! $300 is an expensive lesson. I will earn it back. I swear. It's okay. Okay, you try, mom. First, click The magnifying glass, Then put the cursor Over what You want to enlarge. [Clicking] [Jenn]: why so blurry? From your Cell phone, mom. The less you enlarge, The better it looks. -Oh-- -okay. What-- w-what-- Mm-mm-mm. Absentee-mom intervention. You two have a choice. You can stare at that computer-- ...or you can get your butt Kicked at hearts. [Groans] -boom! -you know you want it. -that's a challenge. -you know you want it! -We cannot turn down-- -we can't turn it down. We've won--we've won Six times in a row! [] Mm. Just go with me here. Seems impossible There was a murder, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. Put that aside. Let's talk suspects. Okay. Let's hear it. And I want motive! Okay, Ive been Working on this. Suspects and motives. [Clack-clack] William Carson, Heir to the Carson family, Who built the house. He wanted to buy the house, But he couldn't afford it. Mm-hmm. Donald Lennox, Real estate developer. He wanted To knock the house down And build An apartment complex. Maybe he still does. Okay! Erica franklin, Present owner of the house, But... Maybe we should rule her out, Because she stands To lose the most From this whole "Deadly room" story. Or we should rule her in, Because she looks innocent. [Click] And then there's Tina, The most obvious suspect, Because she stands To gain the most-- Control of the trust fund, Plus Adrians share of it. Sounds guilty to me. [Phone alert beeps] Ooh! I have an appointment With my astrologist. Oh! The colonial. We still have A statue there. Right. I will Go pick it up. Okay. Bye, honey. Bye. [] [Click] Zip code. [Door creaks open] [] [thud] [] [] [] [Click-creak] [Creaking] [] [] [] [] Ohh... [Grunting] Oh! Oh, no. [Thumping] [] Hey. Have you Heard from your mom? Uh, no. I called her earlier, Got her voicemail. Huh. [Phone buzzes] Hello? oh, hey, dani. it's Jason. Have you heard From my lovely wife? I can't get a hold of her. No, I don't know Where she is, either. I tried calling her, too. I'm getting a little worried. I left her at the shop this afternoon. She may have gone over To the colonial, to pick up a statue we left there! [] Jennifer! Jenn! Let me check upstairs. I'm going to go this way. Jenn! Jennifer? Jason! Her purse and phone are here! -Jennifer! - [muffled]: Jason! - [muffled thumping] Jason! -Jenn! [Jenn]: here! In here! Hold on, honey. I'm gonna get you out. - [click] -I got it! [Jenn gasps with relief] Aww. Oh, Jason. Aw, thank goodness. -ohh-- -you okay? Yeah. Ohh... Isn't this trespassing? Can I press charges? Um... Maybe. [Sighs] probably not. You had a lockbox on the door, She had the code. How did you know the code? Adrian. She told me all the codes To the lock-boxes Are the zip codes. And you came by To retrieve a statue-- The barye stag! Uh, thank you-- which You loaned for the open house? Right. And then I found The hidden stairway That leads To the bedroom. I knew about the stairway. So what? I don't want you Sneaking around this house. And I want you to stop with This nonsense about a murder. Detective. What is the official cause Of death of Adrian Merrill? Natural causes. Well, then who closed The door behind me And trapped me In the stairway? [Door creaks] Just like that? Yes. [Mechanism clicks, door thuds] [] [Erica scoffs] Do you know what this is? Cap to something? I think it's what You put on a syringe To protect the needle. Where'd you find this? The hidden stairway. I think somebody Injected Adrian with something. You don't know how long This has been in the stairway. I mean, Think about it-- You've watched The entire tape Of Adrian sleeping, And nobody injected her, Right? Right. It would be on camera If someone had. And there was nothing In the autopsy report, right? [Sighs] Right. So what do you think now? I think Im gonna Finish my pie. Colonel mustard With the candlestick. I'm thinking Professor plum With the rope. [] Ahh. I knew it! "1,000 times More deadly than cyanide." Tetrodotoxin. "One fish Could kill 30 people." Ooh. [] Hemlock. Okay. Mercury? Well, got that. Watch your tuna. "A medical toxin, Succinylcholine, "Similar to curare, Used during surgery Or emergency intubation." Wolfs bane. Untraceable? "Causes arrhythmic Heart function "Leading to suffocation. "Leaves and stem are toxic "And easily absorbed Through skin. Must be handled With protective gloves." Wolfs bane. [Pen scratching paper] -Wolfs-- what? -"wolfs bane." It's a poisonous flower, Very toxic to the touch. You have to wear gloves If you're handling it. So, not a "deadly room," A deadly massage? [Laughs] that's funny! But what if it had been rubbed On the sheets, for example? Have you been up all night? I think you need more rest. Here, let me Take your temperature. Seriously, dani, This could explain a lot. Oh, hold on. [Ringing] Hello? Hi, Tina. Uh, yes, I can do that. Very good. I'll see you in a bit. That was Tina. She wants me To go over to Adrians. Something about Going through her stuff. Ooh. Hey, you have a friend Who grows exotic flowers? Yeah, angelica. Would you mind calling her? And seeing what you can Find out about wolfs bane? Not at all. -thank you. -mm-hmm. [] And... Go! Nice. Nice. Okay, let's do another one. [Awkwardly]: hey. Hey. Uh, Ill catch up With you guys later. [] [Words catching]: um-- Uh... If you're gonna ask me To the dance, I appreciate You thinking of me. [] And Id like to go. Cool. Yeah. Cool. I mean... Thanks. [] Thanks for coming over. Wow... Hi. Hi... Let's go Out to the garage. You're bluffing! You don't have that ace. So, here's all the stuff. Do I just donate it? There's personal things I don't Really want to go through. If you want anything For your store, You can just have it. Most of the furniture Can go to charity. They'll pick it up, And Ill go through the boxes At the store, And donate what's appropriate. Great! I figured You might know what to do. I didn't know You were involved with William. I met him at the open house. You know he tried to buy it? He's a Carson, Used to be in his family. Yes. I'm a little naive. Can you really make that kind Of money playing on-line poker? Enough to buy A house like that? Willie wanted to buy it Before they sunk All that money into it. He still might, If he can win a big tournament. Hmm. William Carson wants the house Because it's part of His family legacy, Which is crazy. Why's that crazy? Well, he doesn't have The money to buy it. So he's moved in With her? Humph! Oh, yeah. Hey. Check this out. Did you know Peter and Adrian Worked together? Oh, yes. A long time ago. Before we ever met Adrian. Did you ever find anything Out about wolfs bane? Yup. It's not hard to get. Angelica had some In her orchid house. Toxic to the touch? Yeah. Sort of. If you touch it With your bare hands, You'll feel all tingly And weird, But you won't die. It's lethal If you eat it, And it's easy to crush it up With water and make an extract. Well, I wonder if You injected that into someone, If it would it kill them? I asked her that, And it would, But they'd be Violently sick For about four hours. Oh! I guess we can Rule that out. Good. So, what's the connect between William and Tina? I mean-- He was flirty At the open house, So things must have Moved really quickly. Well, William wants to buy A house he can't afford. He hooks up with Tina, Who's the only person Who's profited By Adrians death. -nice. -well... If he wanted to buy the house, It's a lot cheaper now. And if anyone would know About the hidden stairway, It would be him. Thank you very much. So, everyone at the agency Was talking about you Getting trapped in the stairway. And we even had to change The code on the lock-boxes. Normally, I don't panic, But I was getting there. I can only imagine. Erica franklin Called me yesterday. She wants me To take the listing. The colonial? Yeah. But I said no. I just didn't feel comfortable About it. It was Adrians listing, And she'd done such a great job. I know, But if you don't take it, Someone's going to. What would Adrian have wanted? That's exactly What my boss said. He really doesn't Want to lose that property. So Ill see. Erica gave me 24 hours To reconsider. Is there Any interest at all? No. Well, actually, There's one low-ball offer From William Carson. How does a guy like that Even scrape together A low-ball offer? Well, he's got A little family money, And I hear He's some kind of gambler. Mm. So Ive been thinking about Our last conversation, About who would gain From Adrians death-- Now that's motive, right? It all begins with motive. Well, I can think of a couple-- Some of them far-fetched, Like, uh, Carson trying to Knock down the price. But I keep on Coming back to how. If Adrian was murdered, how? [Sighs] I was looking Into deadly plants. Wolfs bane, For example. I thought it might be some kind Of contact transmission, But that would only Make you sick. Try this out. Is there any way Of releasing some kind of gas, Or cutting off the oxygen To the room So she just dies in her sleep? Uh, from An unvented fireplace? -carbon monoxide? -right. Wouldn't that show up In an autopsy? I guess so. I got to get back to work. Is Erica considering The low-ball offer? Not yet, But eventually, She may just have to Take a loss and move on. Thanks for coffee. My pleasure. [] [Bell jingles] Hello. May I help you? Afternoon. Can I ask you a favour? Sure. What do you need? I own a number of properties Around the colonial house, All this talk about it Being cursed And a "deadly room," It's hurting everything. Well, how can I help you With that? Leave it alone. I know you have no intentions Of keeping this rumour alive. So why don't we just accept What the coroner's ruled As a natural death? You're right, I have no intention Of fuelling any rumours Connected with the house. Great. But-- I am sceptical That she just laid down And died. [] Are you a doctor? A police detective? You own a second-hand shop, And suddenly, You're an expert And you know better Than the professionals? You're not serving her memory By doing this. I'll be the judge on How I serve my friend's memory. My advice? Leave things alone That don't concern you. [] So, uh... Amy asked me to the dance. And...? Well, I heard "mom voice" In my ear, So I said "yes." Figure Ill survive. There ya go! I can't wait For the wedding. [Laughs] just kidding. Hey, um-- That movie, "the sting"-- Um, that was about A horse race, right? Yeah. A bunch of gamblers Figured out a way To delay the telegraph results So they would know The winner before anyone else. Pretty cool, huh? [Dress swishing, Heels clacking] Huh. What do you guys think? -wow. -whoa... That is beautiful! Are you buying it? Because I think its $300. Mom! I'm borrowing it. Two of my delta sisters Want to enter a dance contest For Greek week, So we're making duplicates Of the dress And we're doing the Charleston. Oh! I can do the Charleston. You want to see? [Kids]: mm-- Maybe later. Hey, after dinner, Can you show me something On your computer? -yeah. Sure. -thanks. [] Okay, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. Pause. There's Adrian's watch. Can you blow it up So we can see the time? Um, yeah. Can you make it Not so grainy? I can run a program That generates missing pixels. Might help. Yeah, let me see. [Clacking] What if you were to run The pixel program For a three-hour segment, How long would that take? Mm, it's a pretty static image, Might take a couple of hours. Okay. Fast-forward To about 2:30 a.m. And go three hours From there. What exactly Are you looking for, mom? We'll see. the sting gave me an idea. [] Okay, Logan, Let's play it back. Whoa, whoa, but that'll take, Like, three hours. It's almost Midnight now. Well, put it On three-times fast-forward, It'll take Less than an hour. You want to stare At a watch-face for an hour? I'll make you french toast In the morning. Deal. Okay. Thanks. [] [Hypnotically]: You are getting Slee-eepy... Ve-ry slee-eepy. [trance-like]: you will Take out the trash Without being told. Your son should Have a cool car. He needs a cool car. [Chuckling] [Sighs wearily] Please don't ever Tell anyone I did this. They wouldn't understand. There it is! Look at that. Like, three minutes are missing. Rewind it. Play it again. Yeah, yeah. [Keys clacking] Can you go to the wider shot? Yeah. [Clacking] Okay, we're just Seconds before and... Oh! Yeah, there it is. Okay, pause. [Clack] Blow up her hand. [Clacking] Now play it back And watch carefully. [Clack] [] What does that mean? [Exhales] oh... That means the live webcam Was not live. This has been edited. [] Ready? You always tell me To eat slower. Fine. Let's do this! Okay. Yeah. Okay. Um... So, we'll start recording. -um, nothing for a few seconds. -right. Okay, you can step in now. -okay. Off-camera. -yep. Now I am on-camera. Right. -okay. -yeah. Looks good. And a few seconds of you. And that's great. Yeah, yeah. Come on. Cool. And we get a few seconds More now of you out. It's back to nothing. - [beep] -that should be good. Alright. Let's play it back. Let's do it! -check it out. -now I am on-camera. right. -okay. -yeah. Looks good. How's that? Okay, now edit me out. Okay. What I have to do is, uh, Just make a cut here-- Before you enter... Then one over here After you leave... And... Yeah, here we go. [Clack] [] Mom, that's it. The key is to have A static background. If anything's moving, It'll be obvious Something's been cut out. But if nothing moves, You can't tell There's been a cut. Could someone delay A live-webcam for three minutes? Absolutely. I mean, It takes some hacking skills, But you tap into their server, Or high-jack their feed, And then send it out Three minutes later. [] The killer had to be In the house the whole time. -the secret stairway? -yes. He or she had to be able To take control of the server And delay the signal. Then walks out, In full view, Just like when I walked to the chair, And kills her. The killer then Edits out that section, And from then on, The webcam is truly live. You're amazing! Are you going To detective Lynwood with this? No, not yet. I still have to figure out How Adrian was killed. Oh. That. All we know Is that the killer Had a three-minute window To do something To stop her heart That would leave no trace During an autopsy. Air. A couple of syringes of air, Directly into a vein Could do it, But it would have to be i.v. Why? Why not a syringe? You'd need To do it twice To get sufficient air To stop a heart, And you'd need to make sure It was in a vein, And not an artery. What about toxins? Like curare, or wolfs bane? Wolfs bane? Oh, I hate the internet. People are getting All kinds of bad ideas. What about 'em? Or something Like succinylcholine? They could all Stop a heart. Wolfs bane would show up In the post-mortem. Curare, maybe not. Your best bet is... Succinylcholine. It's metabolized So quickly, It's virtually Undetectable. How fast would it act? You're paralyzed in seconds. You die within a few minutes. You would be conscious, But completely unable to move, Swallow, or breathe. You are gonna die... And you know it. There were no needle marks Found on Adrians body, But is it possible To have missed A single injection site During an autopsy? It has happened. Who would have access To succinylcholine? Any hospital, E.R., Any ambulance Would have it. E.M.T.S use it To intubate people. Veterinarians Could have it. If you are thinking That Adrian Merrill May have been murdered By an injection Of succinylcholine, Please remember There was a camera on her The entire night. Right. Thank you. [] Cdt2cdt2 [news reporter] : ...ag to the national weather service, we won't get relief from the-- Hey! Oh, thank you. No. Down payment. For what? We took a solid third In the dance contest! So, that goes towards The 300 that I owe you For my bad purchase Of the flapper dress. Oh, sweetheart, You don't have to. No, no, I said that I would, And I will. Besides, we had a ball. I owe you two, now. Wow. Well, look at that. Our daughter paid me back. She borrowed gas money From me today, So I think 20 of that Belongs to me. Uh... No. [] I think somebody Hacked into Adrians computer, Delayed the live feed By three minutes, Injected her With succinylcholine, Edited out the murder, And has completely Gotten away with it. Who? Well, the killer Would have to have Computer skills, Medical knowledge, And enough familiarity With that house To know about The hidden stairway. And motive. It sounds like William Carson to me. What about Tina? Or could they have Done it together? If I go to Lynwood with this, He's gonna think Im crazy. If only you could get That three minutes Of film that was cut out, You'd have your answer. Wait a sec. Maybe I can. Hey, Logan, it's mom. A quick question. If something was recorded On a computer and then erased, Is there any way To get that back? Okay. Thanks! It's possible. If we can get her computer, And if the hard-drive Hasn't been reformatted. Where's her computer? [Knocks] Hi, Tina. I'm sorry to bother you. Adrian had a laptop. It had some photos on it Of me and Adrian, And some of our friends, I wanted to make copies. Do you think it would be okay If I borrowed it? Come on in. I should only Need it for the day. I don't remember a laptop. I think She had one for work. Probably a company computer. Sorry. [Jenn sighs] [Laughs] hey, look. We did have some fun times. My weirdness after her death... I think that was just A defence thing. I'm not very good at Processing emotion. Hey, Jennifer. It's good to see you. William. I heard you put an offer In on the colonial? I have, yeah. I mean, pretty low compared To what they were asking, But if there's any justice In this world, Erica will just accept my offer. Hi, peter? It's Jennifer. Adrian had a work laptop. Do you know Where that might be? probably here at the office. Why? Well, it had Some pictures on it, Of Adrian, me, Some of our friends. I wanted to borrow the laptop And make copies. Would that be okay? its okay with me. Im meeting some clients out at the colonial. meet me there and you can take it. Ill need it back in a day or so. Okay, Ill see you there. okay. Bye-bye. it's Danielle. leave a message and Ill call you back. Beep. - [beep] -oh, hey, dani. It's me. I just left Tinas. It was a little weird. I'll explain later. Anyway, Adrian had a work laptop, Peter's getting it, Im gonna Meet him at the colonial. I'll talk to you later. [] [] Peter? I'm taping! Come on up. [] These virtual tours are great, I edit them down, And then, uh, People from all over Can check out the house On the 'net. Weren't you meeting Some clients here? Oh, they cancelled. Oh. [] [Peter]: my laptop's in here. I've got it all booted up. I'm pretty good With computers. Used to code and program, Back in school. Peter, this could take a while. I don't want to keep you. I could take the computer And bring it back tomorrow. Actually, no. I could get in trouble If I let you have it. There's some work stuff On there. But have a seat. I've got a flash drive Plugged in. It'll just take me a sec To copy these. I know her pictures Are in here somewhere. [Phone rings] [Reaches in purse] Don't. [Ringing] [Ringing] [Phone ringing] [] You're not really here For the pictures, are you? What did you discover? Three missing minutes From the webcast. something was edited out. [Gasps] oh! You hacked into her server, And you delayed it By three minutes. That's impressive. You had to be In the hidden stairway, Waiting for Adrian To fall asleep. You had a syringe Full of succinylcholine. They say the killer always Leaves evidence at the scene. I found this In the stairway. Love is a strange thing. How it can just... Change. She left me behind. [] When you asked for the laptop, I figured the game was up. How did you know? The minute-hand on her watch Was visible the whole time. Sometime after 3:00 a.m., It suddenly jumped forward Three minutes, And that meant Something was cut out. Would you like to see The missing footage? No. [] There's a program Called "ghoster" That can retrieve Recently deleted And corrupted files. [Hits a key] I took the liberty Of running it. [] Here we go. [Gasps] Look. [] I said, look. [] [Gasps] Let go! No! Oof! Ahh! [] [Hammers cocking] Freeze! [] You okay? Yeah. I'm okay. [] [Jenn]: well, the picture That dani found Of peter as an e.m.t. Was the key clue. The killer had to have Some kind Of medical background To know about that poison. And then I remembered Back to the open house-- it was peter asking the old man with chest pains all the questions before the ambulance arrived. Just... Peter was not on my list. I was so focused On everything else. If I could only Get the hard drive, I might be able to see The killer commit the crime. Why didn't you call me Before you went After that computer? I should have. I wanted to wrap everything up With a nice bow. I had thought of everything, Except the "who" In the "whodunit." But wouldn't the body Be in a different position After the edit? Peter did try To arrange her body In the exact position it was in Before he injected her. He used a freeze frame As a reference. Alright, you may have Figured this one out-- I'll give you that much. Do you understand How close you came this time? Okay, I won't make Promises I can't keep, But I will promise to try And not solve things on my own. Fair enough? What happens To Mullin now? Well, D.A. Is filing "Murder one." I spoke to Some of his co-workers After the arrest. There was a previous Romantic entanglement. In addition, They were competitive At work. He thought he was getting The listing for the colonial. She got it, And as a result, She was gonna make partner. He did say that She "left him behind." Oldest motive there is. But, thanks to Jennifer, We have the visual evidence We need On the laptop's hard drive. Good. Way to go, mom. Thank you. Cheers! [All]: cheers! That's the last time, Jenn. This is becoming a habit. [Jason]: that's my girl! He looks great. He's been Moaning about it. Oh, he's gonna Have fun, trust me. [Doorbell chimes] Logan! Your date is here! Amy! Hi. Hi, Mrs. Shannon. You look Absolutely gorgeous. [Chuckles] thank you. Come in! Come in. I brought this For Logan. Oh, that's so sweet. Hey. Hi. Hi. Let me put this on you. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure. Um... [Camera shutter snaps] Oh, uh, yeah-- This-- This is for you. Thank you. For sure. [Shutter snapping repeatedly] -smile! - [shutter snapping] Okay, uh, we should Probably get going. -yeah. -have a good night. -yeah. -have fun! Alright. -a lot of fun! - [awkwardly]: yeah, for sure. Uh... My dad said You could drive his car. Want to? [] Yeah. Sure. [Laughs] [] Wow! Not too fast! Don't embarrass him. [Shutter snapping] [Snap-snap-snap] Goodnight, son! Oh, I got Some good pictures! Oh, you sure did. [] [Logan speaking downstairs, Muffled] Jason. Jason, I think I hear something. [He groans] [Logan]: right there. Duck around the corner. Don't get hit! That was an innocent victim! He was a collaborator. Good shot. Oh, hey, you two. I didn't hear you come in. Hi, Mrs. Shannon. H-hey, mom. [Amy sighs] Well, Im just gonna... Make myself some warm milk. To help me sleep. [Long sigh] I should go. Yeah. Yeah. Uh... I'll walk you out. Oh, uh... There you go. I had a really great time. Me too. [] [] [Door shuts] [Wistful sigh] So? Did you have a nice time? [He sighs] I had a great time. She's so cool! And look, She even beat my high score, Which is saying something. Well, Im glad you went. Hey, hey! I-I told her You were all into mysteries And she is, too! -really? -yeah, yeah! She's, like, obsessed With this one writer. Who? Um, have you ever heard Of Agatha Christie? []
