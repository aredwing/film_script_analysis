Today she has behaved we/L Don '[ you agree ? Still, one shouldn't be forced to shadow his own wife. We're wretched, we're beggars. Always anxious, always agitated, it can't go on. When one gets here, better shoot himself. And then shadowing her, you could be wrong, couldn't you? Should I stop? What do you think? Give me an advice. I don't know. A pity you're not an officer, you and I get along fine. On the other hand, hierarchy should be respected. Othenrvise, everything would go to ruin. You understand me, don't you?

Go and fuck. And remember, you must always squeeze your buttocks, not open them! - Scram! - Yessir! Listen, fag, you must stop bothering my soldiers! - Calm down. I don't take orders from you, l'm a free citizen, not a soldier! - Give up my soldiers! - What "your soldiers"? Do you own them? l'll denounce you! Denounce who? l'm as in my home here. This is illegal entering. - There's a sentence. - Shut up! If I catch you yet again with one of my soldiers, l'll smash your face!

On the contrary... on the contrary... lt'd be great seeing people change under your eyes. You could put it down on the job... See the soldier putting on weight, taking a healthy colour... .. the shadows under his eyes go away... He learns walking, saluting, having a straight posture! When he arrives, you know, he's dazed, clumsy, a mummy's boy! A/ways leaning on the walls! Have you noticed? - Yes. They change in 12 months... Imagine having a son for life! When small, letting him cry during the night! Then sending him to state schools. Cold water, no heating! And then, after elementary school, all summer abroad, so he'll learn the ropes! And in high-school, whores, l'll take him! So he skips wanking! Go! Why are you running? Why are you running? You're hitting me with the foot! You're dirtying my face! - Go slower! What do you care? - Fuck you! Weren't you the one hating military life? - You'd have cut yourself an arm to go home! - Can't I change my mind? Passeri, come fonrvard! Passeri was the best.

I 've fallen in love with someone else. That's all. When does this fuck begin? - Quiet! - Boys, he's right, it's been 10 minutes! Come on, letis go! Wait] Baio never disappontsl Tell me you love me! Tell me you still love me! - Louded - Yes, I love you! - Say it louded - I love you! - Louded - I love you! - I can'! hear you! Louded - I love you! - Again! - I love you! - Again! - I love you! What are you doing? All alone?! Go awaaay! Go away! With Captain Asciutto, please! Yes. Hello? Listen carefulyl You're a royal deer, a giant elk, an ibex! You're the greatest cuckold in the world! You're the only one that doesn't know that l'm banging your wife 3 days a week! Anytime I want! Who are you? Say you're name! And if you don't believe me, I can send you her hair in an envelope!

Where? - Don't you see it? - They are two like us! - Please, let's go further! - "Please, let's go further" Here. Here it's alright. - Here! - Yes! I got it! What are you doing? You're mad! You're hurting me! Why don't you and Asciutto have children? I heard the other day the dumb things he was telling you. A child fixes so many things. A child doesn't fix anything. He has every right to demand it. l'd abort immediately any Asciutto's child! I don't understand what has he done to you, so you'd hate him so much! Listen. Keep out of all this, it's my business! It doesn't concern you. I don't know, I don't know, whenever you want you spit the venom! What for must you seek vengeance? Explain yourself! My love, stop defending him! You don't know but he has done me only harm! I don't know, Ok, it's not only his fault, l've got my share of responsibility... But, at this point, it doesn't matter knowing who's right, and who's wrong. At first... At first I was afraid he'd throw me out... I took the blows, then sought revenge, he'd make me suffer, l'd make him suffer, and I liked it! Anything's better than living with Asciutto! I can manage on my own, I don't care! l'm tired... but really tired! Two beings that don't respect each other, should live together, do you understand? I... l've talked to Asciutto. And I assure you... He's head over heels in love! I don't care he's in love with me! If he rapes me, if he abuses me, if he strikes me whenever he wants, this isn't love, it's fascism, isn't it? Fascism? What the fuck's got fascism to do with it? What do you know about fascism? What is fascism? You always read that shit... magazines and all that trash! l've never seen you open a book! What the fuck are you talking about?! No, what are you talking about? I? I say... I say, for instance, that you don't do a fucking shit all day long! And he's busting his balls in the barracks, supporting you, and you fuck with everyone, not only with me or him! And, then, always playing the victim, when he's the real victim! For God's sake! Now, l'll kill you. Come here! Come here! Where were you? Where were you? Where were you? Who is he? Who is he? Who is he? Speak! Whore! Whore! Who is he? Come! Answer! Come, speak! Speak! Speak! Speak! Come, speak! Speak! EnoughL . . Enough! Enough!... Enough!

Here it is. - l'm sorry. - Thank you. l'll go right now! No, no, l'm not going back to Asciutto! Maybe we ?e wrong, on at least I am, - after all he's done for me! - What has he done for you? You know very well he has helped me! Has hewed you how? He has given me... self confidence! He was the only one that... He often tells me that if a man wants, he can bring the world to its knees! - I know it's rethoric, but... - Why should you do that? What bullshit! /711 not going back Listen... l've thought about it... I thought that, maybe, we might get along well, you and I, together. You and me? Alone? - Yes, why not? - No... Why not? You hurt me! Alright. Then l'll go away alone. Where are you going? Without a man to help you? Without a job? Shut up! Listen. l'll give you an advice: Stay away from Asciutto, he'll only harm you, do you understand? You won't be able to hide behind him for ever. You can'! stay a boy for even I... I don't understand anything, anymore! Alright. Bring him back the car. Bye. Where are you going, Rosanna, please! Look, what do I know? Be careful, it's dangerous! You can never tell who you're dealing with! Where're you going? Be careful crossinu. Rosanna! Are you leaving me a/one ? "VADE MECUM OF DUTY" Then? It is for good? Passeri, tonight I want to do something extraordinary! I want to set a record! I want to fuck all the sentries! You'll come with me! l'll teach you something new! We'll take them all prisoners! And you'll have a rifle! Agreed? Agreed? Yes. Listen, Guaccio! Please, don't chase me away! I must speak to you! Who's sending you away? - Asciutto, wants me to... - Hey! Go to bed! l'll close the lights in two minutes! Asciutto, wants me to go with him, you know he likes disarming sentries... He says he wants to teach me. He's totally insane! I... - I don't know what the fuck to do! - It's easy: don't go! - It's not at all easy, I... - Look, I won't say anything more. Decide for yourself! From now on you must learn to do on your own. And you? Why are you still dressed? Move! Get in bed! And put the cigarette off! - Are you going out? - Yes. What are you still doing here?! Go away! - Get lost! - We don't want you with us! He's pushing on! Do you stop following us, yes or not? - Fuck off! - You're through with us! - Spy! Go away! l'll bust your balls! Let him be! We threw shit on him, we're even! - Give it up! - The nerve he's got! - Stupid! The coast is clear! Asciutto's patrolling! No! Be careful! Who's there? Who is there ? Friends. Password! Captain, l'll shoot! l'll shoot! Hey, Passeri! What have you seen? You aren't going to rat on me, are you? Don't be afraid. You went by the rules. You've seen I first fired in the air! Yes, you've first fired in the air, haven't you? THE END
