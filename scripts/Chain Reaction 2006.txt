You don't need to send anybody. 3- 2, you can return to Western. Uh, I think about... two or three hours. 71, clear. Over. Excuse me, but I think you're making a terrible mistake. You are not supposed to fucking think. If he doesn't make it, you won't make it. That's it. Well, l... I tried to tell you before. I can't do very much for him here in the woods. The painkillers'll keep the pain at a minimum for a few hours, but what he really needs is professional care. What are you trying to tell me, you're not a fucking professional? Wait. What I want... I'm trying to say is he needs to go to a hospital. Well, I think that the only hospital that will take him is the maximum-security hospital of the Seattle state penitentiary. But hey, why don't we ask the patient? What up, little brother? You wanna go back to Seattle? I think we'll take that as a negative. Now you had better come up with a better solution, or I will blow your ass away. And, Doctor, that is a promise. I don't know too much about this, but maybe we should think about it, huh? I mean, it's pretty insane to head up to the mountains in November. - It's fucking dangerous. - You think I don't fucking know that? I also know that that is the way to the Canadian border. Now, we head north, and that's that. What is it good for if we freeze to death - or starve before we get anywhere? - We will make it! And then the good doctor here is gonna help out Spence. Right, Doc? All right. We got about two fucking hours, so stop your arguing, and let's go. What do you mean we got two fucking hours? The cops think that a tree fell down in front of the interstate. Our driver was cooperative about relaying that message before I blew his fucking head off. They're probably on their way over here now, so let's go. Good. The time. What time is it? Dr. Bates, Dr. Madsen speaking. Uh, unfortunately not. No, they refused to give us a better price on the tomography scanner. No. I think I'm gonna put a bid in on a leasing model. That way, we won't go way over budget. Good. OK. I'll be back in about an hour. Of course. We can discuss that when I'm back in the office. Right. I'll see you at 1:00. Bye. Quite frankly, I don't agree with your diagnosis, Dr. Mengele. If you even try to remove anything from my brother's body, I will fucking tear your limbs off. Arthur, nobody wants to amputate his arm. Basically that's what we all want to avoid, but certainly you can see we've got some serious problems here. It'll take us a few days before we get to the border. Do you think he's gonna make it? 'Cause I don't. Way I see it... your brother's a dead man walking, and you just gotta accept that. All right, you and Vince are gonna go it alone. That is, if you think you can make it, but remember, I'm gonna come looking for you both, and one day, you're gonna pay your dues. If Spence and I hadn't covered your asses in Seattle, why, you'd be fucking dead now. It wasn't like that, and you know it. Oh, fuck that. We are all staying together right up to the end like we promised. And you might want to stop shooting, eh? Oh, yeah? Yeah. Because somebody might hear you! Capisce? All right, seems I've stopped the external bleeding, and that's really all I can do right now. But the artery is still leaking internally. Bones in his lower arm are fractured, and the bullet's still lodged inside, so there's an increased possibility that the cartilage and the muscle will become infected, so what he needs right now are infusions and antibiotics. Otherwise the wound will become septic, and then he'll either lose his arm or, worst-case scenario, his life. Then what do you propose we do? Well, honestly it'd be best if you let him and I go back to the interstate, find some help, and bring him to the hospital. I'm not going back to that shithole. You heard him. We carry on. OK, OK, but Spence needs rest. And I've gotta get that bullet out very soon. That's definitely a priority. So we have to find some shelter, because I can't do anything else for him here in the woods. Oh, really? You can't do anything else more for him? Well, I guess we no longer have any use for you. Kiss your ass goodbye. Arthur, hey! Cool it. What the fuck? Maybe we'll find a shelter somewhere, and then he can help Spence. And for Christ's sake, we might need him later. - He's our only fucking hostage. - Hostage? If you shoot me now... you might as well shoot Spence too. He won't survive if somebody doesn't take care of this in the next few hours. I wanna help. Believe me, I do. Just let me. Put the fucking gun down, man. Hey, you can always kill him later when Spence dies... Oh, fuck. You know what I mean. Ah, God. You fucking asshole, eh? I'm not going to die. We're going to find someplace, and then the doctor will fucking take care of me. God! Promise me, man. Hmm? You have my word. So what the hell we waiting for? Let's get a fucking move on. Arthur, please, just think it over one more time. You may end up killing your brother. It's still not too late to let me take him back to the interstate, flag down... Hey, dude, are you crazy? Now the medicine bag's gone. How is he going to help Spence now? Fuck the bag, man. He's been trying to provoke me sinc... Aw, shit, man! Did he try to provoke you, or did he? He should play by the rules. We should fucking waste this guy. That's exactly what I'm talking about. The rules are Spence is supposed to live. Right? Or am I wrong? The doctor is supposed to be our hostage, remember? - Hostage. - You just don't change the rules at halftime, jackass. Jesus. Are you trying to provoke me now too? Aw, shit, man! Is there anybody apart from Spence who doesn't provoke you? Hey, bro, he said he'd help me. He promise. Stupid motherfucker. What a complete idiot, eh? Why can't he just let us get away and save his own fucking life? Why is he trying to play the hero? Because he's born to be the hero. He's one of the stupid motherfuckers that makes this country so fucking great. Hey, why don't we just go in the goddamn woods? I don't think that hero's dumb enough to follow us in there. No. He'll call the whole fucking police force. If we wanna buy some time, we gotta finish him off. Shit, you're right. Hey, Arthur, I got a great idea. Fine. OK, bro, he's all yours. OK. Just like good old times, huh? We'll provide him with a little friendly fire. I'll flank him from the right, you go on the left, and we'll take him out together, OK? What? No other volunteers, or what? Huh? Wimps! Aw, shit. OK. - OK? - Yeah. OK? Let's go. Come on. Huh? You like that? Want more? Huh? How about right now? Fuck! Fuck! Hey, Vincent, go help Spence! Why me? I have to check out something in the bus! You have to check out what? Don't worry about it, homeboy. Get Spence like I said, goddamn it! I bet you got wife and kids at home, and I know you wanna live. So do me a favor. Make the call. Over. ...they had better forget it. - Fuck. - Holy shit. Fuck. This looks bad. I think he needs a doctor, Art. Who would you suggest, Marcus Welby? We gotta get out of here. Hey, why don't we just wait for a car, man? No way, bro. It can take hours until another car comes by. We are in the middle of East Bumfuck, Nowhere. I mean, if you think about it, it's fucking pazza. I mean, two cars collide at the same time on this godforsaken stretch of road? It's a one-in-a-million probability. The chances are... Thanks for the math, Einstein. Steve, check the car. Hey, wake up. Wake up, man. Are you awake? Are you hurt? Do you think you can walk? L... I don't know. Well, why don't we give it a try? And I want you to walk your punk ass slowly out of this car. And, Doc... don't forget your bag. Madsen... Dr. Douglas Madsen. You had a little accident. My name is Stephen. But you can call me Steve. Now I'd like to introduce you to some of my friends. This is gettin' crazier by the minute. You ain't gonna believe this. We got us a fuckin' doctor now. One in a billion. Steve, get the uniforms off the cops. You got it. By the way, you'll be coming with us. Wh-wh-what? Wait. Wait. Wait. L... Please, l-I've got a bad leg. L... Well, you better hope to hell that you can keep up. Vince. You know, you really should listen to Art. It's extremely simple, really, Dr. One-In-A-million. You do the walkie, or Signora Beretta will do the talkie. What the fuck is this shit? It's called fog. Moisture condenses to... I should've let you die in Seattle. Just trying to help, as always. We seem have to lost our orientation. I doubt very much we're still heading north. Yeah, good point, Dr. Boy Scout. So, wherever we're heading, that's where we'll arrive. Hey, Vince. What do you think, man? Campfire? Don't think so. The smokes raises too straight and too thick for a campfire. This looks like it comes from a chimney. And where there is a chimney, there is bound to be a house. In the middle of fucking nowhere? What kind of people would live out here, man? Hunters? Lumberjacks? Maybe it's the fucking Canadian Mounties. Well, we're gonna find out, that's for sure. Arthur, please, no more violence. Absolutely not, Dr. Gandhi. Just shut the fuck up and get ready for your big chance to take care of Spence. It looks like we found him a cozy little place here. Goddamn. I must be dreamin'. Hey, Vince, pinch me so I can know I'm not dreaming. Look at this house. I mean, who would build a house like this out in the middle of absolutely fuckin' nowhere? You see what she did with that sheep? She took some of its blood. Some African tribes do exactly the same thing, the Masai, for example. No shit? Blood is a sort of food for them. It's a... it's a substitute for salt. That black ointment, that could prove to be very useful to us medically. And that, man, is one good reason why we are going inside. And we're not going to ask for assistance either. We're just gonna take command and help ourselves. OK, let's rock. Thy hallowed Father, what bringeth thee thy children? Steve, check that room. First, you won't be asking any questions, and like all good children you will only answer when you're spoken to. And second, you are going to be very helpful, supportive, and above all, quiet. If we demand anything, you will get it for us immediately without the slightest peep, and when we are ready, and only then, will we leave. Oh, yeah. And third, if you cooperate, no one will get hurt. If you don't cooperate, every one of you is gonna die. Put Spence by the fire. Leaveth thee, in the name of thy Lord. Hey, preacher man, what do you think, huh? Do you really believe thine Lord will be able to stop this bullet when I blow this little girl's head off? Now who do you think's in charge here, thine Lord or my gun? Obeyeth we thee. Saith us thy will. Hmm. Forgotten already. Oh, and by the way, shut the fuck up! So, time to fix him up, huh, Doc? Oh, my God. Spence, can you move your fingers? OK. Listen carefully for just once, please, Arthur. Without the instruments from my bag, I can't get that bullet out. I'd just make the arm even worse. But the artery's gonna continue to leak, which means that his blood pressure's gonna continue to get lower and lower until... There's only one way to save Spence. No way. Never. You listen to me, Spence. I will not let him do that. It's his last chance! We have to amputate the lower arm and seal off that artery. It's the only way he's gonna make it. But how are you going to seal the stump? You don't have any clamps or anything else, eh? The black ointment. We gotta try that black... the black paste she had. It seemed to work on sheep. My brother is not a fuckin' guinea pig! You had better come up with something better than that, or... Or what? Or what? I've really had quite enough. You wanna shoot me, go ahead. Go ahead! Just shoot everybody right here and now. You should start with your brother. At least you'd spare him all this needless suffering. You! What's your name? Alice, sire. You will assist the doctor, and you better be a good little nurse, or I'm gonna waste your entire fucking twisted family. Aye, by your will. All right... so you're Alice. Aye, sire. I'm Douglas. But you can call me Doug. Doug art thou. Yes. Do you understand what we have to do here now? Aye. Understandeth I, but understandeth thee what happen could when thee here stayeth? Heareth thee me. Stayeth here not. Raineth thy God's wrath on thee. That's it, you old fucker! I have had about enough of your bullshit! One more word out of any of you, and you're all dead meat! Hey, Arthur, I have an idea, man. Why don't I lock these crazy bastards up in that room I saw over there? All right, lock the fuckers up. But if any of these morons tries any tricks, then just shoot them straight in the face. - You got it. - You heard what he said! Get up! Let's go! - Come on! Move! Move! - That goes for you, too, big boy! Let's go! You heard what he said! Come on, move it! - Get inside! - Come on! Get in there! Come on! Get in there! Come on, move, move, move. Move. Move. Move! What? You think you can handle this? Haveth I a choice? I'm sorry, but I think not. What shall I doeth, sire? First boil some water. Then bring me some towels, something to soak up the blood. And then I'll need some... some big knives, sharp knives, maybe a hammer, and some cord or rope. Do you have any of that? Aye, haveth I. Now we'll have to stop the bleeding somehow. You have some sort of black paste. Do you think that could help us? Saweth thee I earlier? Yes, we did. Do you think that black ointment'll help Spence? Aye. Stoppeth it blood. Healeth it wounds. Good. Very good. OK, go put the knives in boiling water. Leave 'em there for about two minutes. Haveth we here a clock not. Then slowly count to 100. Do you have any liquor? Booze? Alcohol? Aye, haveth I. Bring it. We need to sedate Spence. You love your brother, don't you, Arthur? He is the only one I've ever been able to trust. Well, you're gonna have to trust me now. And her. But I need to know I can trust you too. Fuck you, Doc. Don't you talk to me like that. I need you to promise me something. You're not in a position to make demands. Who the hell do you think you are? I can't promise you Spence is gonna survive. I simply can't. So if he dies, I know I'm gonna die too. But I need your word that you will not take the lives of the other people here. They don't have anything to do with this. I need you to promise me this, or you can shoot me right now. Because there's no way I'll operate if you don't. So... do I have your word? Yeah. Good. Blessed is our Lord... Blessed is our Lord... Who giveth us thy gifts... Who giveth us thy gifts... Which we receiveth from our bounty... Which we receiveth from our bounty... Through our Lord, Christus. Through our Lord, Christus. Amen. Blessed is our Lord... Blessed is our Lord... Who giveth us thy gifts... Who giveth us thy gifts... Which we receiveth from our bounty... Which we receiveth from our bounty... Through our Lord, Christus. Through our Lord, Christus. Blessed is our Lord... Blessed is our Lord... Who giveth us thy gifts... You're the only person in my heart. You will always be there. OK, Arthur. That's all I can do. Alice... take that away. Burneth thee the arm? Doug, so must it be. And leaveth thee all, thy friend Spence too. Leaveth he, he must. Please, taketh he away. I don't wanna hear a single peep out of you, Little Miss Alice from Nowhere Land. And leave that arm alone, do you hear? Burneth thee the arm, we must. Thou art God's will. Just shut the fuck up! Steve, Vince, get the rest of the folks back up here again. I'm a doctor. Let me through. Careth shall we for she. Taketh we she to her chamber. She could hurt herself in this state. Knoweth we the child. Taketh she will us to her chamber. Arthur. Don't put your hands on her, old man. Let them handle it, please. All right. Just get the screaming bastard to shut the fuck up! Steve, go with 'em, just in case. On your... Get up. Don't you try it. Easy, easy. Of course. You! Move it over there. Come on. Move it! Move it! Move it! Faster! Come on! You, get back to Spence. So... how is he? What do you fucking think? What the fuck went on in there? Something is wrong with these folks. I mean, we brought them in, they gathered around, started praying. Everything was cool, and suddenly that little kid got... Flip out or... like crazy. She was sniffing like a dog. She came towards us, sniffing at the door. She was like an animal. And then that other guy... I think his name is Phillip... he became restless too, and then she started screaming and convulsing like mad. You know the rest. Everything's OK. He tied that bitch to the bed, man. What? You heard what I said, bro. He tied her to the fucking bed. All the beds have ropes on them in there, and the poles are padded. It's like a scene out of the fucking Exorcist. And if that ain't strange enough... the walls have chains on them. Yeah. Yeah! They got chains and shackles on every fucking wall. It's like a sort of... torture chamber. Chamber. Dungeon. Shut the fuck up! Sires... biddeth thee again shall I. Thou shall now leaveth. Biddeth thee farewell, please, or thy Lord, that giveth and taketh, shall punish thee for thy trespasses. Is no one fucking listening to me? I am the only one that fucking giveth and the one that fucking taketh away. Got it? Fear for thee and thy weapons we have not. It is thee... what must amongst us fear hath. Hey, that other guy, he's not here. Well, Vince, don't just fucking stand there. Go find him. Yeah. What's wrong? Crazy man... he just ate Spence arm. What do you mean he ate Spence's arm? He ate Spence's arm. Are you crazy? Forgiveth me thy trespasses. Resist could I not thy fate. No! Knoweth thy never what thou amongst us doeth. Sealed now shall the fate be. Ringeth shall the cries to the firmament of heaven above. Suck on this, you fucking freak! Fucking... Fuck! You're not human! You are monsters! Thee? Betrayeth thee thy own folk? Stop, motherfucker! On your knees and hands up! Hands up! What kind of house was it? Are we talking about a cabin or what? Something like a... a big, old cabin. Did you encounter any people there? Any residents in the house? No. I have to leave you now. I know that you are sad now, and I am sad too. You're the only person in my heart. Always be there. But there is something about me you don't know, and I'm afraid that one day, I might hurt you even more. No people. And that, my friend, leads us to one of the most interesting facts here. Apart from the other samples we found, five other different blood samples were on your clothes and especially your shoes, and we couldn't match them to anybody so far. So tell me more about these other bloodstains. Where do they come from? Whose fucking blood is it? I already told you, l... I don't know. Did you kill them? Who? You tell me. I don't get it. Why are you lying to me? Something happened out there, so why won't you just tell me? I already told you everything. Everything. You better get your fucking story straight, mister. You see, we have 16 problems here... six dead police officers on the interstate, four notorious, dangerous killers still on the run, five more blood samples from five more possible victims, and one fucking house that cannot be found. So you better come up with some answers... soon. You believe in demons? Monsters? The very first version again. OK, let's get this straight. Don't believe you're going to get away with this by pretending you have lost your mind. OK, friend... you have the right to remain silent. That's true. But now let me tell you about our rights. Because we consider you to be a suspect and no longer a witness, we can keep you in jail for 30 days. So tomorrow you'll go to Seattle as a prison inmate. But in the meantime, we are going to find those people, or we'll get the truth out of you some way, so why do you wanna waste any more of our time? We got you collared, Doctor. Could I talk to my attorney now? Hey, what's up, Doc? Aw, he don't wanna talk to Georgie Porgie. Uppity dumb-ass. Hey, doc, we heard about your little trip into the big, bad woods with King Arthur. Pretty impressive. Pay his ignorance no mind, sir. Just take a look at the picturesque setting, the absolute sheer beauty of unbridled nature. We won't be able to enjoy this for quite a long time to come. I try to make the most of these transports, especially these that travel through such exceptional territory. Sure beats an inexplicable view from a putrid jail cell. Don't let him fool you with his extraordinaire vocabulaire. He'd smash your fucking head in in a second, not even needing the slightest reason. In fact, this chap has a reputation of killing other inmates just to get transferred into another prison. Another scenic bus transport through the wilderness. C'est vrai, Paul? Jimmy, I didn't know you could speak French. Extraordinaire, mon cher. My deepest apology. It was not my intent that my plebeian friend deny me the opportunity of introducing myself personally. Paul Anderson. Enchant. Doctor? Madsen. Doug Madsen. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my god. Fuck. Shit! Fuckin' all right, motherfucker! Fuck you! I could use a hand over here! Stay where you are, or I'll shoot! Put your hands up! Put your hands up, I said! Put your hands up! I'm serious! You astonish me sometimes, Jimmy. Sometimes. Not often. You wanna show this lowlife a little commiseration? No. Thought I'd save him for George. Bastard shot him right in the 'nads. Oh, how sad. Don't you think somebody should be looking in on Dr. Madsen? His talents are quite conveniently in our forthcoming predicament. George, would you be so kind and exculpate my hasty actions? Yeah. Thank you. Any idea where we're headed, brainiac? Doesn't matter. Hunt us down like wild game. Jimmy, according to the statistics, our chances remain better if we move into a northerly direction, towards Canada. Yeah, just like Arthur and his knights. My premise is not based, at least, on what Arthur did or why he did it. I simply prefer the beautiful north because it provides us with the most breathtaking wilderness. All right by me. North it is. You are the man with the plan. Am I? Fabulous. Oh. How ecstatic to see you hale and robust. I'm gonna run and get me a gun. What a gratifying surprise. I told you again and again and again. He got shot in the arm at the shoot-up on the interstate. All right, so far, I believe you, that they forced you to come with them and that you helped Spence with his arm. There was a lot of his blood on your clothes. But then we found blood samples of the others too. No. Not again. This can't be. Gentlemen, we're moving out in five minutes. And we need to find the first-aid kit for the doctor. Right. Better 'n fuckin' fireworks. Hell, I ain't no doctor, but at least I know that George needs some fuckin' attention. I don't have enough legs for both of us. Patience, Shawn. We need much more distance between us and the interstate. Can you hang in there, George? I think so. It's all startin' to get numb anyway. Is that good or bad? Six of one, half a dozen of the other. Bit of both. Pretty normal. Ah. About normal, Let's talk about Arthur's normal. You said that he set you free because you helped Spence. That's ironic. The police and the cons are both callin' me a liar. Well, this doesn't resemble the asshole we all know and well respect. You see, he was always very consequent about his no-eyewitnesses concept. And by the way, Doctor, there's no shadow of a doubt that you are lying. But I respect that. "Lying is the art of pleasing each other." Oscar Wilde. - I need a rest, guys. - Me too. Ah, come on. Hang in there, George. You are quite a brilliant man. Great. Brilliant man with a short life expectancy. How do you feel about the leave-no-eyewitnesses philosophy? I wholeheartedly agree with Arthur. But if you are of use to us medically and as long as you stimulate my intellect, you shall live. Is that a promise? Oh, a man like myself doesn't give any promises. For me, a promise is the root of treason. Oh, what a panorama. How beautiful. You don't have to worry about feeling embarrassed. Let's get that suit off. If I didn't want to be embarrassed, I would have chosen... another profession, Doc. OK. Come on, meet... Giant George. But... be careful, Doc. He's a very good friend of mine. That might be a little counterproductive. You're makin' me and my hands very nervous. You're makin' me nervous too. How does it look, Doctor? He's lucky. Bullet went straight through the scrotum, hitting only his left testicle. I just have to scrape away what's left, but I can't do it here. In the interim, all I can do is disinfect the area and pad the wound. He should be able to walk for a few more hours, but sooner or later, I'm gonna have to remove the remains. I took care of the injured arm of the man they called Spence. So you were no longer of use to them. I think so. They... I would have only slowed them down. Spence? That's Mr. Spence Palmer, right? Doctor, I'd like to know where you performed that operation on Spence. Stumbled onto a small lodge. Like the ones hunters use? Correct. Good. Bring us there. Isn't that the first place the police'll search for us? Probably, but they didn't discover you the first time, did they? Then, uh... this way. Wait a minute. That's not north. That'll put us parallel to the interstate. Well, according to the doctor, that's where the other group headed. Yeah, right. My big, red, white ass. Shit. He's tryin' to fuckin' play us. Is that an accurate assumption, Doctor? You know, we don't tolerate treason. Yes. Yes. You are lying. You know, there's a fine line between lying and treason, and I'm afraid you have just crossed it. This scarlet letter marks you as a traitor. There you go. I granted you your life in exchange for George's manhood, had you acted in accordance with the rules we have set down. Your deception now has earned you either an immediate death or a slow, torturous one, the latter being the end the divine Marquis de Sade himself would have enjoyed in elation! Death waits for us anyway if we head north. "It's uncertain where death awaits us. "Therefore let's expect it... everywhere." Come on, Doctor. That argument we had, don't take it too personal. You had a little mishap. You infringed on our trust. Well, maybe my reaction was a little bit extreme, huh? Cheer up! Enjoy the surrounding. And acknowledge you are still breathing. How amazing. How beautiful. Just like a scene out of the Grimm brothers' fairy tale. I can see visions of ghosts and fairies floating through the haze. Trees cast shadows of giants... gazing back at us with yellow, gleaming eyes. So wonderful! This is just like what happened before. The fog. Then we lost our orientation. Dj vu. "The eternal repetition of all the same," as Nietzsche would have put it. Yeah. Don't be so pessimistic. We are following the same path as Arthur, and you survived the last trip. That path'll end, just like my luck, I'm afraid. What do you know about the true nature of luck? You know what Kant said? "Unlucky we are, and unlucky we shall be." Oh, yes. Schopenhauer. Yes. I do get your point, at least your perspective of this. Paul, we're not headin' north anymore. I got the feeling we're walking in circles. Huh. I noticed that too, Jimmy. But wherever we are heading, that's where we will arrive. And where did you do that? I mean, right in the middle of the woods or in a cave? It was a house. Good. Let's talk about the house, then. Where is it? I'm not sure. Can you lead us to it? It's almost impossible. We were completely lost. So, Doctor, is there something else you concealed from us? And don't make me cut the other cheek. Listen to me. We cannot go in there. We have to get as far away from here as fast as we possibly can. Don't test my patience, Doctor. It is not a wise idea. And answer my question. Is this the place where you all arrived? Affirmative! Thanks for the confirmation. Home, sweet home. This is even worse than the white-trash trailer park I grew up in. A fuckin' creepy, hillbilly shithole dream home in the middle of Bumfuck, Nowhere. "In every dream home, a heartache, "and every step I take "takes me further from heaven. "Is there a heaven? "I like to think so." Heaven? Heaven. Roxy Music. The doctor comes to my aid again. One last question. How many monsters live there? Eight or so. Any weapons? No. They don't need any. Any women? Yes. Aw, great. We're gonna have a fuckin' ball. Actually, it's gonna be more like this... He's fuckin' hysterical. Jimmy, I find it difficult to share your sense of humor. But actually, I don't accept the circumstances! Come on. Move on. OIlie ollie oxen free! Come out, come out, you evil breed, and let's have some fun! Yeah! Jimmy, check it in there. Shawn, over there. Get a move on. We gonna catch us some evil breed. We are here to liberate you, my fair damsel. I'll get a knife. She's mine. Me first. Hey! Taketh what thy will. Goeth thou must. Saveth thouselves. Sounds familiar somehow. Let's have a little chat. Listen to us, and then we might goeth. Understood? And you, Doctor, you are skating on very thin ice. Sorry, fair maiden, that we didn't have any time for introductions. I apologize if it seems that I have forgotten my manners. Your name is? Alice. Alice and...? Only Alice. Nice to meet you, Alice. What did they do to you? I mean, I'm no expert, but this is no way to treat a lady. Mine folk. Oh. Interesting. Gets even more interesting, right down to that ridiculous language of yours. In fact, I would really love to meet your family. Liveth we amongst us as family, as folk, but family are we not. I think you're already familiar to our doctor. At least, that's what he said. Aye, knoweth he us. In the past, was he here. Didn't I tell you? And the four gentlemen that were here with him, where are they? Dead art thou. Naught is from them left. Death forgeth thee as well... soon. Alice, where are the others? Hunteth they. Killeth they for blood. Killing? What do they kill? All with blood in it. Really? Oh, yes, the doctor already described them as very, very unpleasant. He was talking about monsters, beasts. Stayeth thee no longer. Believeth and goeth thee. Goeth! Fascinating. You and the doctor seem to be really, really convinced of your troubled fantasies. "Hysteria," as Freud would have called it. But I tend to inquire if it was Freud or fraud this time. Doctor, your services are required. Shawn, how nice to see you again. Cheers, man. Let's do this as quickly as possible and then leave immediately. I'm gonna need an assistant. Alice can help if you permit it. Good. Alice, I'm gonna need boiling water and, this time, a very small knife, but as sharp as possible. - Aye, haveth I. - Fine. Put it in water... Aye, and counteth I to 100. Good girl. Now hurry, please. Don't worry, George. The procedure's fairly routine. You couldn't be in better hands, and Alice is gonna help. Thanks, honey. Maybe later you'd like to meet my good little friend, Giant George. And we gonna get to know each other a little better. - Yeah. - Maybe in your afterlife. Now I have to get those old bandages off. Let's get you out of that. Give me a hand. Easy, easy. Good to the last drop. Ooh-whee, little lady. That doesn't look so bad. Perfect timing. Needeth thee my help, Doug? No, no, I can handle it. Oh, Alice, yes. Do you have any more alcohol, spirits? Alcohol haveth we no more, but haveth I black paste. Bring it, please. Alice. Alice. I'd like you to come back to your seat. Now. All right, I'm gonna apply a little bit of this icing spray. It's gonna dull the pain, and then I'm gonna start to scrape. Just do it, Doc. I'm not crazy about to know what you're really up to. There. That's good. You and Big George are gonna be just fine. May need to recuperate a bit, but you'll be back in action soon. Thank you, Doctor. You just managed to gain a little more time. I would like to continue our previous conversation concerning your fellow... housemates? Left be time not much. Cometh they soon. Goeth thee. Thou must goeth. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just like a scratched record. Could we move on now? Please... just tell us what kind of creatures we are dealing with. Come on, Paul. This is gettin' old. Let's have some fun. When I am satisfied... you get yours. Move! Move! Saith he, he our leader is, Joseph. The bad seed calleth he it. Another word from the Bible. I see you have quite an affinity to the legacy of our Lord. Hope is our Lord. Our comfort is he. You kill through your longing of blood. Are you not all sinners, then? A brief reminder... "thou shalt not kill." Cometh we from our father. Overcometh we our trespasses through our Lord. Overcometh haveth I of this. That's why you were bound to the wall? Nay. Punishment was mine for sins against mine folk. Helpeth I Doug to flee. Forbidden is it. And why did you help him? Enough, trespasser. Mine will is not thine will. Helpeth thee I not. And why are you all banished to this no man's land? Liveth we here to protect our unholy desires amongst men and leadeth us from temptation. Mighty is our longing. But over are times of austerity and fasting. Man's blood again tasteth. Mighty is our thirst. Reapeth we the bad seed. So you're no longer a monster. Sleepeth it in me. Control it must I. From me, learneth will they, learneth to control. Thank you very, very much, Miss Alice. You're the most agreeable and discerning psychopath I ever had the pleasure of meeting, But unfortunately the profane desires of my sociopathic friends outweigh the social obligation and can no longer be avoided. Boys... she's all yours! Wait! Don't do this. We really do have to leave, Paul. Be rational or irrational, if you will. Sure she sounds crazy. Maybe we both do, but there've never been two people with exactly the same hallucinations. One thing I absolutely do know... if we don't leave here soon, - we all die. - Doctor... you are not half as clever as you are melodramatic. I understand exactly what you're attempting to do. You're using the severe mental problem of Alice to protect her and her mental-retarded relatives, or whatever they are, from us, the real monsters. But we have no problem with that. You've failed miserably, like all your earlier attempts. The weaker intellect surrenders to the more superior. And it just happens to be such an incredible disappointment, because of the short, surprisingly short time I had... to realize how insignificant you are. Jimmy... escort the doctor outside. My pleasure. Hey, Jimmy, I don't like that. Leave the man alone. The doc is a good man. - Hey, what the fuck... - I'm fuckin' sick of discussions. Right? Returneth they now. Mercy showeth thee not. Gradually your story's becoming more and more convincing. Blood smelleth they. Death is near. Any suggestion how to handle this? Killeth thyselves. A little bit more constructive, please. All right, Doctor, Alice, you better get ready! This is a good way to die, the way of the warrior! - Trepidation, Doctor? - Oh, yes. "There is no heaven, and there is no hell... and now fear nothing!" No! Please! Get off! No! Fuckin' die, you... "Some miraculous plan born from the chaos of divine spheres." Come on, guys. We're heading north. I have to leave you now. No. Don't be sad. You told me many years ago... that I'd always be in your heart. Remember? Now trust... that you'll always be in mine. But I wanna go with you. Not yet. But I'll wait for you. I have to go now. Till we meet again. Thanks for showing up here, lady. You did us a favor.
