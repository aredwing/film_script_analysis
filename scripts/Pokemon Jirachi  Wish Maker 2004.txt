OTHERS HAVE BECOME THE STUFF OF LEGEND. AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO WERE BORN OF OUR DREAMS. RAHR! LIKE THE POKMON THEMSELVES, THESE TALES HAVE SURVIVED THE TEST OF TIME. [BING] AND WITH EACH PASSING DAY, COUNTLESS ADVENTURES UNFOLD-- FROM THE TOP OF THE WORLD TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. THERE ARE OVER 300 KNOWN SPECIES THAT CONTINUOUSLY ADD TO THE POKMON LORE. BUT THEY DON'T DO IT ALONE. HUMANS AND POKMON OFTEN TEAM UP FOR SPORTING COMPETITIONS. BY COMBINING STRENGTH, COURAGE, WISDOM, AND TRUST, THE PARTNERS HOPE TO EMERGE VICTORIOUS IN WHAT ARE KNOWN AS POKMON BATTLES. TOGETHER, POKMON AND HUMANS SHARE THE WORLD IN FRIENDSHIP, PEACE, AND HARMONY. BUT NOT ALL INTENTIONS ARE PURE. RAHR! THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MOST FEARSOME POKMON TO ACHIEVE GOALS OF CONTROL, DOMINATION, AND POWER. GROUDON, AN ANCIENT POKMON, IS SO COVETED BY THE EVIL TEAM MAGMA. AND THAT IS WHERE OUR STORY BEGINS, WITH A MISGUIDED SEARCH BY A RELENTLESS MAN HOPING TO FULFILL HIS LIFELONG WISH FOR GROUDON. [BOOM] AND WITH PIKACHU BY HIS SIDE, HE'S WELL ON HIS WAY. WHAT HE UNEARTHS INSTEAD IS AN EVEN BIGGER MYSTERY AND AN EVEN GREATER POWER ASH KETCHUM HAS WISHES OF HIS OWN. TOGETHER, THEY TRAVEL ON A POKMON JOURNEY, MEETING ALONG THE WAY FRIENDS WITH HOPES AND DREAMS OF THEIR OWN: TO DISCOVER NEW POKMON, TO EXPLORE THE WORLD, TO BECOME THE VERY BES TRAINER EVER, AND TO MEET LOTS AND LOTS OF GIRLS. WELL, I DIDN'T SAY ALL THEIR WISHES INVOLVED POKMON! THE FUNNY THING ABOUT WISHES-- SOMETIMES THEY REALLY DO COME TRUE. AND THAT IS WHY YOU MUST BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL FOR WHAT YOU WISH... BECAUSE YOU JUST MIGHT GET IT. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] SO, WHERE'S THE MILLENNIUM COMET ANYWAY? IT WON'T APPEAR FOR ANOTHER 23 HOURS AND 42 MINUTES. KNOW-IT-ALL! UH, OH! ARE WE GETTING CLOSE TO WHERE THE FESTIVAL IS SUPPOSED TO BE? IT SHOULD BE IN THA VALLEY UP AHEAD. WELL, THEN I WAN TO GET THE FIRST LOOK. LAST ONE THERE IS A SLOWPOKE! MAX, YOU'RE A SLOW-BRO! VERY FUNNY, SIS. Brock: HEY, I DON'T WAN TO BE THE SLOWPOKE! [BREATHING HARD] PIKA! [EVERYONE BREATHING HARD] [SIGH] NOT MUCH OF A PARTY. ARE YOU SURE THIS IS IT? THIS...IS THE SPOT. WHERE IS EVERYONE? WHAA! BOY, I'M STARVING! ME, TOO. ASH AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE TAKEN A DETOUR FROM THEIR POKMON JOURNEY TO WITNESS WHAT FEW GET TO SEE-- THE MILLENNIUM COMET, WHICH APPEARS FOR ONLY 7 NIGHTS ONCE EVERY THOUSAND YEARS. THEY HAD HOPED TO TAKE PAR IN THE MILLENNIUM FESTIVAL, BUT THEIR TRUE ROLE IN THE LEGEND OF THE COME WILL BE FAR GREATER THAN THEY COULD HAVE EVER DREAMED. [RUMBLING] PI. PIKA. UNH...

I THINK...IT'S SLEEPING RIGHT INSIDE HERE. Brock: IT'S LIKE A COCOON. AWESOME. PIKA. OH, THAT'S AMAZING. SO THE VOICE THAT MAX HEARD-- YES. IT IS SAID THAT IN ORDER TO AWAKEN FROM ITS SLUMBER, JIRACHI NEEDS FOR 2 THINGS TO HAPPEN: THE MILLENNIUM COMET MUST BE VISIBLE IN THE NIGHT SKY, AND JIRACHI MUS FIND ITSELF...A FRIEND. IT NEEDS A FRIEND? IS THAT WHY IT WAS TALKING TO MAX? SO NOW WE JUST NEED THE MILLENNIUM COMET. HMM, AND THAT'S TONIGHT. AWW! HELLO...JIRACHI. FIRST, MAX WAS HEARING THINGS, AND NOW HE'S MADE FRIENDS WITH A BIG ROCK. CUT IT OUT! YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS THAT JIRACHI CHOSE ME TO TALK TO AS HIS FRIEND INSTEAD OF YOU!

HE WAS WORKING ON THE GROUDON PROJECT. May: GROUDON? ISN'T THA THE LEGENDARY POKMON RUMORED TO HAVE INCREDIBLE POWERS? YES. AND TEAM MAGMA WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO GET THEIR HANDS ON GROUDON. BUTLER TRIED TO MAKE THEM A GROUDON, BUT HIS EXPERIMEN FAILED. I DON'T GET WHAT JIRACHI HAS TO DO WITH ALL THIS. WELL, IN ORDER TO POWER HIS MACHINE, BUTLER NEEDED AN ENERGY SOURCE THAT'S AVAILABLE ONCE EVERY THOUSAND YEARS. EVERY THOUSAND YEARS? PI? OHH. May: THE MILLENNIUM COMET. Diane: JIRACHI CAN ABSORB THE COMET'S POWER. BUTLER WOULD USE THIS ENERGY TO MAKE A GROUDON BY DRAINING ALL OF THE COMET'S POWER FROM JIRACHI'S BODY. SOUNDS LIKE THAT COULD REALLY HURT JIRACHI. YES. UH... [MOANS] WHY IS BUTLER DOING THIS? Diane: HE WANTS REVENGE AGAINST TEAM MAGMA. WELL, LET HIM GET REVENGE SOME OTHER WAY. WE CAN'T LET HIM HUR JIRACHI. SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE BEST FRIEND, MAX. PIKA.

Diane: JIRACHI WILL OPEN HIS TRUE EYE AND USE IT TO ABSORB ENERGY FROM THE MILLENNIUM COMET. WHAT DOES IT DO WITH THE ENERGY? WHERE'S IT GO? Diane: THEY SAY THA DURING THE 1,000 YEARS THAT JIRACHI SLEEPS, ALL THE ENERGY HE ABSORBED FROM THE COME IS SLOWLY RELEASED INTO THE EARTH. EVERYTHING THAT GROWS IN FORINA FEEDS OFF THAT ENERGY. SO, THEN JIRACHI HELPED MAKE ALL THIS? WOW. [CLANGING] JIRACHI! [ALL GASP] WHAT'S HAPPENING? IT'S A TRAP. [BOTH GASP] SHOWTIME! AND, LIKE EVERY GREAT MAGICIAN, I SAVED MY BEST TRICK FOR LAST! BUTLER. LET JIRACHI GO! FOR THEIR FINALE, MOST MAGICIANS WOULD PROBABLY END THEIR SHOW WITH SOMETHING VERY OBVIOUS, LIKE MAKING A POKMON DISAPPEAR.
