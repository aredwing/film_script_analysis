Nearly seven months has passed since the last sighting of the infamous self-made superhero known as The Vigilante. Made headlines last year when he allegedly killed a rising Armenian syndicate. (SPEAKING SPANISH) And with his disappearance, the city's crime rates have risen by 40%. Michael Hanover's web videos went viral after being the only person to capture The Vigilante in action. The question is, where is The Vigilante? (CRACKLING) - (SNEAKING SPANISH) - (GRUNTING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (LAUGHS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) La-la la-la la-la la-la la-la la-la la-la la-la la-la la-la La-la la-la la-la na-na na-na na-na Bam! La-la la-la la-la la-la la-la la-la la-la la-la la-la Bam! (LAUGHS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) - (GRUNTING) - (PUNCHES THUDDING) - ls that it? - WOMAN: No. Unfortunately, that's no! it. Handsome. That'll make it fun. I hear they call you The Vigilante. Is that correct? Is that correct? - Fuck you. - Ah. You can take pain. I like that. There's a very pissed off Armenian boss who sent me. You killed his baby brother. And this is when he saw you, Mike Hanover, the filmmaker. And now he wants you to suffer... badly. He will find Mike next. You had no idea you were at war with the Armenian mob, did you? (CHUCKLES) When was the last time you were touched like this, hmm'? Fuck you. (WOMAN CHUCKLES) (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING) (WOMAN CRYING) (WOMAN WAILS) (SCREAMS) Wait. (SINGING ALONG WITH OPERA) (SOBBING) Please! Please, I told you. (COUGHING) I just party with Mike. That's all. I don't know where he goes. I don't know what he does! I'll tell you what he does, this fucking joke. He puts videos on the Internet making this man to be a hero. That fucking psycho that killed my baby brother. But they said The Vigilante's gone, right? That he's dead! That's no! good enough. You know, they sell T-shirts with his face on 'em, and I have to look at that shit in the street. - Ah! - Mike Hanover. Now, tell me where he is. I don't know. I don't know. - I don't know. Please. - Shh. (SNIFFS) You luck like shit. Yeah, you do look like shit. Come on, bitch. That's right, bitch. Motherfucker! Die, motherfucker! Fucker. (YELLS) Fucker! Die! Die! Die already! Fucking dick! Die, mother... (COUGHS) Ew! Gross! Gross, gross! Come on! (GAGS) Shit, man! I don't know where you been! Just... Oh, God. (SPITS) (SCREAMING) That's me, Mike Hanover, and I just killed a man in a taco shop bathroom. Hey, but he started it. I been hiding near the border looking for The Vigilante, and hit men are on my ass. Wait. ls that how I really run'? Anyway, I had cars, chicks, a badass crib, and now I got this piece-of-shit ice cream truck, and we're on the run from the Armenian mob. It all started seven months ago with a documentary I was making. Okay, here's (he backstory, so pay attention. That's The Vigilante, the big dude. The big dude right there mowing down bad guys and shit. You met him as a Special Forces in the prologue. Not anymore. Now he is running the streets and taking out fuckin' drug dealers, gangs, you name it. He has a sidekick, too. They call him The Kid. Look, I got to tag along and document some missions, throw it up on the Web, and that's what made this guy Internet famous. This last video was at a heroin lab where they were using little kids as drug mules. Can you believe that shit'? It was fucked up. So Vigilante was capping dudes left and right. Then he sent me and The Kid to hang back at his safe house while he cleaned up the mess, but this was no ordinary safe house. Oh, no, It had chicks, titties, and it had Jade, his numero uno lady. She was like the Alfred to his Batcave, and they were this crazy, badass couple. She ran shit, but I should have been watching out for Red. That's right. This little hot chick that worked for Jade. I was blinded by that ass. After that, we went back to the heroin spot to pick up The Vigilante, but it was still crawling with bad guys and shit, and he was after these guys something fierce. The Armenian mob and him had beef like a motherfucker, and shit was about to hit the fan. Fuck. (GROANS) Shit. (GUNS COCKING) (SPEAKING ARMENIAN) Don't move! - Get your hands up! - Don't fuckin' move! Mike: Then it all made sense. They wanted him there to get his ass out in the open. It was a setup. No one's seen or heard from The Vigilante since. After all that that, he was just gone, just like that. When The Kid and I came back to find the safe-house girls dead, we knew it. We knew it was a setup. - (TABLET VIBRATING) - Oh, shit, it's Jade right here. This network secure? MIKE: Look, they might be able to hack into my porn, but other than that, we're good. - Good. - You feeling okay? - I'm fine. - Are you sure? - I said I'm fine. - You don't look so hot, all right'? I mean, you're still hot. I'd bang the shit out of you... - Mike, shut up! Listen to me. - Okay, what? Intel over the Mexican cartel feeds have them holding an American captive for the Armenian mob. - Could be him. - Shit! Yeah. No other reason why the Armenians and Mexicans could be working together. The Kardashians could be having a quinceaera. I know a guy that can help. - You know a guy? - Yeah, I know a guy, all right? Gay Barry. He got me out of a few jams in L.A. That's what he does. You know, he's just one of those connected dudes. I didn't know if he was C.I.A. or worked for the Apple Store, but he just knows shit. I guarantee he knows some Call of Duty-type dudes. I'll send someone over now. - Who? - Don't worry about it. - The less you know, the better. - Okay, as long as the dude is cool, he'll be fine, all right? Barry's a little weird. - Weird? - Eccentric. (MUSIC PLAYING) (SINGING IN SPANISH) There's someone here for Barry! Barry! You interrupted my swim lesson. This is Jake. He's my swim coach. Jake, go in the house. Wipe that oil off before you sit on the couch. Okay '. Bro, you know why the fuck I'm here. You gonna help me or not? I would help you if you'd learn some manners. You can't just walk around like you're Baby Blade and break into people's homes. What's up with Generation Me? None of you guys give a shit about anything. - You gonna help me or not? - Okay, I'll help you. But first, Marta, get him a sugar-free Red Bull. Oh, my... (SPEAKS SPANISH) Really? (SPEAKING SPANISH) He's not here to fuck me. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Half of what you said is not in my Rosetta Stone. (SPEAKS SPANISH, LAUGHS) It's kind of... It's almost like an arranged thing. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Let's just go in the house. Marta! I want my fucking burrito after my meeting. So, Vigilante, huh? I like his work. Actually, when Mike called me, I got a boner for it. Didn't say you'd be coming, though. Yeah, Jade likes lo keep us separate. - Safer that way. - Yeah, smart girl. So, how did it work? Were you in the Big Brother program, and Vigilante just walks in and says, "I'll take the black one"? - Fuck you. - Touchy, are we? - What is all this'! - Every tactical op in the state... F.B.I., C.I.A., A.T.F., some-even some chatter from local terrorist cells, loo. I just monitor it, look for patterns. For what? Hey, just because I don't get up at dawn anymore and do pushups doesn't mean I don't love my country. - You ever heard of SEAL Team Six'? - You were a SEAL? Yeah, I was a SEAL. "Don't ask, don't tell," it's fucking bullshit. Besides, I'm still doing my part to keep assholes like you safe. Oh, here it is. Okay, now the last thing we got from Mike has your boy right here just south of the border in Mexico. I know the perfect guys for this. Ex-Blackwater studs, bored and badass. - They'll do this. - How you know they'll do it'? Trust me. They'll do it. - Marta! - What? - Get the car! - Oh, no, no, no. (SPEAKING SPANISH) I can't get a divorce. It's par! of my cover.

Gay Barry! - Wolfman. - Gay Barry, man! - What the fuck, man? - We gotta talk. I got us a gig. It's big. Let's do this, man. Let's talk. It's huge, like 12 inches. (CHUCKLES) Come on, man. Let's go talk, man. You need to... - You look good. You been training? - Don't touch me, man. - Mexico? - Just the border. - You have positive l.D.'! - Enough. - And you can trust the intel? - (SCOFFS) Who's paying? Rich white kid from the B.H. He's got the money, trust me. He'll meet you guys in Tecate, blitz extraction. You'll be back in the U.S. before you know it. It's all good. - What's going on here? - Time to go back to work. Chillax, he's with me. Gentlemen, meet Kid. (CHUCKLES) ls you going black now, Barry? - Once you go black, man... - Hey, fuck you, man. Now, chill out, little toy soldier. A little badass, this one, huh? - (LAUGHS) - This little badass - is Vigilante's sidekick. - Don't call me his fucking sidekick. Look, Barry says you all are who we need to get this done. The Vigilante's being held at the border by the cartels, and I need some more guns. - Simple as that. - What do you think, Geek? If the intel's solid, I'm game. I like paydays.- - It's true. Mexicans like paydays. - (LAUGHTER) Oh, come on. Mucho dinero, right'? Oh, come on. I'm just kidding. So, what's up? Can we do this or what? There's only one thing I like doing more than chicks. It's making money. (MUSIC PLAYING) up! Everyone! (SPEAKING ARMENIAN) (CHUCKLES) What the fuck are you doing? (SIGHS) - What the fuck are you... - Hey. He was our brother. You're ignoring your business, my business. You need to end this. Just kill that motherfucker and get it on with. But we're not done yet. I want the man who made The Vigilante a hero. You bring us down. But I run this family. (ECHOING) Take the shot. Two males. - Cannot confirm l.D. - MAN: Green on both. L-I have names, contacts. I can help you. (SPEAKING KOREAN) What the fuck? He was still alive. That's your fault. You hesitated on your trigger pull. We could have got names out of him. He was the name. What are you doing? They're gonna be coming any minute. - Ain't nobody coming in here. - What are you talking about? You were gonna pull on me there, weren't you'? I saw it in your eyes. Yeah. Your training's far from over, son. Let's face it. (EXHALES SHARPLY) I'm fuckin' hungry. Let's go gel some breakfast. (LAUGHS) (ECHOING) If he's too good at what he does, it can come back lo haunt you. Man's gotta be careful nowadays. If he's too good at what he does, it can come back lo haunt you. Whole world's in an upheaval. Sometimes when you're needed, you gotta take care of business. (CALL TO PRAYER ECHOING) Your identity's gonna be erased from all the databases, foreign and domestic. It'll be like you were never even born, like you never existed. You understand your commitment? And there is no discharge from this service, son. You're never gonna live a normal life again. You're a stone-cold killer... plain and simple. No family, no next of kin. EVERYBODY': gonna want you. C.I.A., Rangers, SEALS... this ain't like that at all. Those fellas get to go home at night, see their families, kiss their wives, and play with their kids, build that little white fence around the house, and, you know, sing hallelujah. Your country needs you, plain and simple. - You follow? - I do. All right. Good luck. Woman: Time to wake up, handsome. You'll like this. (SIZZLING) (GRUNTING) That smells good. What happened to you? What happened to the tough guy that's always in the news, hmm? (SHUDDERS) You are a fucking nobody. You couldn't cut it with the military or the feds. - (CELL PHONE RINGS) - Look who it is. Can that piece of shit hear me? Yes. Hey, Mr. Vigilante, or whatever the fuck your real name is. You're a trophy now, not a person. I want to know something. Was it worth it? No. Except for that stupid look on your brother's face when I put a bullet in it. Please send me videos. Will do. This is going to be fun. - (BUZZING) . (DOG BARKING) (BUZZING) (BEEPING) (MEN SPEAKING SPANISH) (DOG BARKING) I guess it's not your time. Mmm. That's how we say good-bye in London. (GUNFIRE) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Spread out! Find him!

You still owe me ten Gs. You remember that? Now's not the time. We have to go now. (GROANS) - You good'! - All good. (MEN SPEAKING SPANISH) I believe this is yours. I thought it'd be bigger. (TIRES SCREECHING) Yeah! Holy shit! Aw, fuck! Yes! Shit, Jade, they fuckin' did it! They got him! We got him! He's okay! - They did it! - Copy that. Man, you should... It was insane! You should have seen this shit, the action. There was RPGs and there was land mines and fuckin' night vision and fuckin' machine... (MIMICKING MACHINE GUNFIRE) I even saw fuckin' kuh-tai-sin! Kuh-to-sin! It was fucking awesome! - Mike, shut up. - Oh, my God, wait! The Kid! - The Kid was with them! - I know. I know. - Wait. What? You know'? - Of course. I've always known. What did I say? Safer to keep us separate. Anyway, now that he's back, it'll all be okay now. Things will be different. (STATIC) and we can move... move on. Jade! Jade! The hell? Holy shit. Red! - Get out of the ice cream truck. - I thought you were dead. Shut up. Now. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - You really are an idiot. (SLURRING) Why would you go to the... - WOMAN: He's not gonna talk. - (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) (SAW WHIRRING) I have the package. Enough with the military lingo. I'm a civilian now. I'm tired of hearing that shit. Now, you kidnapped the rich kid, right? Now don't say affirmative. Say yes. Yes. I'm bringing him to you. Nah, fuck, no. Your boyfriend, the dude that looks like Dracula, he still wants revenge, right? So bring the rich kid to him. Let him have some fun. The Vigilante's still on the streets. Good. That fucking gorilla draws so much attention. Let the cops and the feds hunt his ass. We can get to him. No, no, no, no. I have plans for him. - Now, is that it? - Yeah. Enjoy your evening. (WHIRRING) About that uranium... I don't... I don't know anything. - I don't know. - You heard him! - Where is it? - (WHIRRING) - (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) - Tell him. Tell him! (SCREAMS) (MAN FADING IN) You made a commitment. (ECHOING) I didn't beg you for that. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. You should get that looked at, you know. Soon, yeah. What the fuck happened over there? - Nothing you need to know about. - It's my life. I'd like to know what the fuck is going on. Your life? It's not your life anymore. You gave that to me. That belongs to me now. You made a commitment. I didn't beg you for that. You don't remember, do you? That was different. It was for my country. Now it's for the world. All you gotta remember is infiltrate, pull the trigger, and get the fuck out. Outside of that, there's nothing more to talk about. And if we've reached an impasse, there's gonna be a conclusion that you're not gonna like one bit. I should've seen this coming. I saw your psyche masts, you know. Propensity for rebellion and challenge of authority and, uh, borderline bipolar and all that, you know. Look, I don't need to hear that fuckin' shit now. Come on. It's been a short time, okay? Get used to it. You haven't been around that long. I don't wanna, you know, put down your worldview, but, uh, it's never been about, uh, good versus the bad. It's about keeping the powerful in power. There's no out for you. There's no out for me. There's only the next mission. (WATER RUNNING) (SIGHS) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (GROANS) This is what you did with that Arab cash. We be diversifying, man. I be flipping cars. Tex be making tamales and selling them. And dude right here, man, he opened up a gym. What's the name of your gym? XPC? DFG? - EPX. - We got a problem. I just got this. What the fuck? How'd they get him? Mike had to open up to communicate with us about the feed. They were watching. They found him. - VIGILANTE: Jesus. - Who's they? The entire Armenian mob. They don't like me. Nobody likes you. Those dudes don't play. Half of 'em ex-military. Your boy's dead. Wolfman, the fucking white guy, The Armenians, all that shit, ain't none of our fuckin' business. We did our job. Here we are, and there he is safe and sound. Just show me the fuckin' money. There is no money if he fuckin' dies! This fuckin' white guy is the one who's paying. I suggest you start planning a rescue operation. - From the Armenian mob? - BARRY: Yeah. That's not a rescue. That's war. Look, I'll take a rain check for saving your ass, but this rich douche bag who own daddy won't pay to save him... that ain't on us, man, that's... that's your shit. It is on me. Just me. I need wheels. Got you. Gear's in the back. - You know where Mike Hanover is. - Of course I know where he's at. Planted a tracker on that dumb-ass the day I met him. The only person I trust is that big motherfucker over there. (CAR STARTS) (TIRES SCREECH) So, what's up? We getting paid? (CHUCKLES) The dude still owe me ten Gs. Nobody get paid around him. (HORN HONKS) What is that? It's close. There's his ass right there, that black BMW. Vigilante: All right, give him space. - He's going in mat garage. - I got him. Hang back. What the fuck is this? It's a setup! Go! Move! (YELLING) (SAGGING) Stop... stop moving. (COUGHING) - (GUN CLATTERS) - You're dead. I'll kill you. (COUGHING) (SAGGING) (MUSIC PLAYING) Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh (METAL GRINDING) Whoa.

She's hot, and she's Asian! Michael, will you shut up? Shut the fuck up! Look, tell that fuckin' Armenian I got his money, and I'm sending it now. This idiot's really your son? Yes, that idiot is really my son. Raven... make our guest feel at home. MIKE: So, anyway, r-really, though, what's your name? Listen, whatever my dad's paying you, I'll pay you double. Now all I... all I want to do is just have a little fun here. This is going to be fun. - It will be fun. - (CHUCKLES) ls that what you're saying? - You're agreeing to my terms? - Oh, yes.

I'm hanging UP- You know, I told you a long time ago, it's not about right or wrong, okay? L... I think, you know, you decided somewhere along the way to use your infinite powers to start a war, to go solo. You wanted a war, well, now you got one, don't you'? But you went too far, went too public, went after the guys who are paying the bills. What's gonna happen (hen? They're gonna call me, right? Good. I'll be looking out for you. Yeah, that's nice, but, uh, you got a lot more to worry about than that, you know, - family and all. - Family? - What the fuck are you talking about'! - (CHUCKLING) Oh, the infamous Vigilante gone soft. Is that it? (' {WOMAN PANTING) - (GUN COCKS) (TIRES SQUEAL) (GUN COCKS) (ENGINE REVS) You said you're comin' after me'! Don't bother. I'm on my way. I'll be right here waiting. (IMITATES GUNSHOT) (TIRES SQUEALING) I think you still have a soft spot for that maniac. That's a very dangerous man, and you just took his fuckin' wife. No, we just took his fuckin' wife. I'm gonna disappear for a while, 'kay? And so should you. (SCOFFS) Man, I'm a businessman. I got work to do. Besides, I'm not worried about your boy right now. I'll keep his attention far away from me for a while, send his ass to Armenia. (SIGHS) Let's remove Mr. Moreau from my contact list. - WOMAN: Copy that. - Make a left over here. (MUSIC PLAYING) You know, agents will flip-flop, and ops will go sideways. Best laid plans can turn into a gigantic clusterfuck. It happens. So I had to improvise and, um, rein things in... without declaring our asset a total loss. I tried everything I could think of to... get him on a leash and... But he's feral, Christ. That's another word for a stray animal. Or a rogue or a ronin or... (CHUCKLES) Whatever the fuck you wanna call him, but, uh... you know, I trained him right, and, uh... once he's dead set... there ain't no stopping him. And that is a fuckin' fact. (FLUTE PLAYING) (SPEAKING ARMENIAN) I need information. All right. You're not gonna drink? You gonna help me or not? Okay '. Let's go. Good. I've been trying to forget that shit. (CLUCKING) (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) MAN: You sent your dogs all the way out here to my home to fuck with me? - When is this game over'! - When I'm done playing. I am done playing. The chess pieces don't get to decide when the game is over, now, do they? No. Somebody has to think it through, be three moves ahead before he moves one piece, and you are a very valuable piece, like my bishop. I need you in the game. What do you want? I have what I want. I'm trusting you with it. What is this? That's my pawn. She'll bring him right to you. - The American? - Yep, your enemy. The man who killed your brothers. I will find him myself. I don't need to kidnap babies to do it. Why are you keeping me here? Because I need you there, that's why. And I need him there, too, alive and drawing fire in his direction. See, the you-versus-him thing, that's just a diversion. The real battle's bigger than both of you, and you're just a soldier, so take your fuckin' orders. Fuckin' Count Chocula-looking motherfucker. - Sir. - Just keep it going. (BIG BEN TOLLING) Woman on P.A.: Welcome to Westminster Station. If you are riding the Piccadilly Line, mind the gap. Next stop, Piccadilly Circus. Well, there she is. Give me a kiss. Come on, that's what you do. We're in Europe. What do you got for me? I have information. Come on. Let's go for a walk. I just-Since getting here, I feel like shit. It's always dark. It always rains. And I know it sounds crazy, I kind of miss my wife. What do you got for me? Here. Come over here. So, I've got good news, and I've got bad news. The good news is I found Jade. The bad news is she's in Yerevan, Armenia. Fuck! Again with the Armenians? That Andreas has a real hard-on for you.
