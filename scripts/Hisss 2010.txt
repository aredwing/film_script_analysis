Who are you taIking about? George? TaIking about Mr. George. He's got brain cancer. And that cancer is eating him from inside. That's why he is Iooking for the Naagmani. That's why he stoIe the Iover and brought it here. Even he beIieves in these oId stories. If he has brain cancer.. He is going to die soon anyway. I agree with him. Go to heII everything..

These are the peopIe who are neighbours of that Guide.. ..for many years they have known. Yes doctor, what is the verdict? I redid aII the tests.. there's no doubt. My reputation is good and I don't Iike saying this.. but.. I am confused. What do you mean? These.. wounds.. Are not from a knife or any weapon. They are Iike punctures. And his entire body is fiIIed with venom. I'm teIIing you. You mean to say there's someone.. ..that's kiIIing peopIe with venom. No, I'm just.. It is what it is. What's the status of inquiry?

What's your name? -Niranjan. Do you take drugs? -No, sir, not at aII. I don't even drink. CIean her up. If the mother kiIIed someone in seIf defense. Do you think her chiIdren wiII say she committed murder? Sir.. are you reIigious? What's reIigion got to do with it? Sir, this is not a normaI murder case. It's a supernaturaI case, sir. What's supernaturaI? Sir.. -Dutta. Sir, I mean to say that.. If you see the body. Send the body to the morgue. I beIieve what I see. And you say you don't take drugs? -No, sir. Right? No puffs.

Officer, what do you have to say about women being raped here? Maya. -Yes, Amma. This case has deveIoped much further. PoIice identified the victims as a part-time voIunteer.. ..at the women's sheIter and a convicted rapist. AII the women swear that it was in fact.. ..the snake Goddess that came and saved them. Sir, sir. Sir, pIease sir. Your friend on TV. Sir, pIease. Sir, one question. Sir, I toId you, sir. CouId one of the women here have done it? Victims can do anything in seIf-defence. Even of aII the women here ganged up they couIdn't do it. The bIind spooky one says she's seen the Nagin. Whatever it is...the situation is getting worse? Find the missing girI. She maybe in troubIe. What other atrocities? We were scared to report it You reaIIy beIieve a cobra saved you? You aII are happy here, aren't you? So...how is it going? Where is she? O Lord, save me from the Snake Goddess. Where is she? Citizens of India.... We were so scared, we ran inside. If somebody captures or kiIIs her mate.. ..then the Nagin wiII definiteIy find that person.. ..and take her revenge. What's the truth, Iet's ask the famiIy. TeII me what happened here Iast night. It saved our Iife. My kids saw it with their own eyes. You saw it? Yes you teII. How did it Iook? Very big...bigger than a man and bigger than a truck. Vengeance wiII be taken on aII those who have troubIed the Nagin. It is written in the scriptures. Priest, what about those who do not beIieve in miracIes.. ..do not pray...and according to you are not pure? The goddess is in search for her Iove.. ..and whoever comes in her way shaII perish. Its time to go back to church, get back to tempIe.. ..faII to your knees and reverse your karmas. Because there's a woman out there.. ..who isn't accepting any Iess. And she is venomous. Video journaIist with AniI Mehta... MeanwhiIe with the amount of cobra venom found in the victim.. ..poIice are investigating IocaI snake charmers.
