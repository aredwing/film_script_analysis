You all cannot go inside. Please do not stop us. We have come to meet the Lord. Wait! Do not rush in like that. This is not the right time. But there is always time to meet the Lord. Not now! - Why not? The Lord Laxminarayan is resting and nobody can go in now. And this is our order. But we were told that there is no objection.. In meeting the Lord at any time. It is a sin to stop us from meeting the Lord. It will be a sin if I let you'll in. What inconsistent speech is this? You are talking wrong. When we do not let men Charithra, Chaturmukh, Sahasracha inside. Do we have to let poor saints like you inside the gate? Now, just go away from here. The Lord does not discriminate between status, affluence and rank. All the beings are one to his perception. The whole mankind needs him and he wants everyone. Did you come here to argue with us? Enough! Walk away from here. We have not come to argue with gatekeepers like you'll. And you cannot stop us from meeting the Lord Shrihari. Your attempt to meet the Lord will be futile. How could a gatekeeper be so pompous? You dare to stop us from meeting the Lord. And even behave impertinently with us. What? DO people like you deserve respect? Will you simply get lost from here? Or should we throw you out? You just try throwing us out. Come! Go away from here. At time of disaster insanity prevails. You stopped us from taking the divine's blessings. And even insulted us. Rude men like you are not fit to serve the Lord. I will curse you for stopping us from meeting the Lord. Narayan! Janardhana! - Laxmiramana! We are blessed after seeing you. Lord Narayan! Please save us, father, save us. We have fallen prey to these holy sages curse. Please save us. Why Jay & Vijay? You are the enlightened one. Do we have to enlighten you, Oh! Lord? Jay and Vijay, like the fire destroys the place it is awakened. Arrogance, pride and imprudence have taken toll in you. In all your previous lives you'll.. Were sworn enemies and destroyed each other. You'll were even born as elephant and tortoise. After lot of penitence and hardship.. You came back to my proximity to serve me. Now, you have offended the sons of the Erudite Lord Brahma. Yes Oh! Father! We have committed a great sin. Then don't you think the sinner make penance for his sin? Then tell me will you take seven lives on the earth as my friends and then come back to my proximity. Or do you want three lives as my enemy on the earth and then come back to me. We cannot be away from you for long, Oh! Father. We do not mind being an enemy. Three lives are enough for us. So be it. His Majesty! The King of Kings, The King of gallantry and valor, Bringing fame to the three worlds, Brave as a lion, Strong as thousand elephants, Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! How can I explicate, Oh! Munificent?

Munificent? How can I explicate, Oh! Munificent? How can I explicate? Brother! There is no one to confront your splendour. There is no limit for your bravery. There is no one to match your affluence. Even after having all these, I am not satisfied. Why? Why Hiranyaksha? All the three worlds should be beneath your feet. Beneath our feet! The three worlds should be in your authority. In our authority! Yes yes. The heaven should fall apart. Yes, the heaven should fall apart! The gatekeepers of heaven should guard our palace gates. Yes, Of course! Our palace gates! Not only that! The lord Vishnu himself should fear you and start worshipping you. Fear and worship me? Fear and worship me! Brother, please grant me your permission. I will give up my life and fulfill these wishes. No! Brother no! Nothing is important to me than your life. Everything else is irrelevant. You are like the three worlds to me. Brother, do you doubt my ability? I have the capability of fighting any great power of this universe. I know that, brother. I know. In rage this Hiranyaksha can even fight the God of death. Brother, please do not try to curb this excitement that.. Is flowing in my body. Do not bind the hands wishing to conquer the universe. Give me your consent, brother. I wish you good luck, brother. Be victorious and come back conquering the three worlds. Hiranyaksha, why is this hilarity? Why is this vengeance in you? The desire to conquer. Lord Varuna, I want to engage in battle with you What? You want to fight with me? Why do you have this foolish desire, Oh! Demon? Because you had fought innumerable battles.. And gained the title of invincible. That is why I have chosen to fight you. All that was in the past. Now I do not have the desire to fight. I do not believe that. Will you fight with me or I will kill you with this mace of mine. Hiranyaksha! What foolishness is this? If you really want to fight. Then fight with someone who can match your valor and strength. Who is that mighty person who can match my strength? Narayan! Narayan. Then I will take care of this Narayan. Soldiers! Take care of this place. Lotus eyed, lotus faced, Lotus eyed, lotus faced, Husband of lotus faced, Goddess Lakshmi, Lord Narayan! Husband of lotus faced, Goddess Lakshmi, Lord Narayan! Lotus eyed, lotus faced, Residing in the minds of the sages, Dancing in hearts of devotees, Giving protection, Whenever called in misery, Giving sympathy, Whenever called in misery, The compassionate father, Lotus eyed, lotus faced, Lotus eyed, lotus faced, You are the creator of the evil and good, You also bring laughter and tears, You are the one to give devotion, You give salvation to the soul, You know the supremacy of your powers, You are the only one, The demons who become insolent, Roar in their arrogance, Bringing victory over evil, Bringing victory over evil, You are the protector, Lotus eyed, lotus faced, Lotus eyed, lotus faced, Husband of lotus faced, Goddess Lakshmi, Lord Narayan! Lotus eyed, lotus faced Who is that? So? Don't you know me? Ah! Oh! It is you, Hiranyaksha. How could I recognize you when you are hurrying so much? That is okay. Tell me where is your journey to? To Vaikunt. Will you come along? Why? To watch the sight of this Hiranyaksha ripping apart that Hari. Oh! No! Why did you even get this stupid idea? Why did you say? Then what else? Didn't you think of taking opinion from Gods like us before contemplating.. ...an inauspicious task like this? Isn't this foolishness? Tell me what is your suggestion? That Shripati is a big perpetrator. We are demons and have more magical power than him. He is the creator of Gods. That is why I am going to destroy him. He is eternal. If I block him down with this mace it will be his end. Hiranyaksha, it is better to listen to your elders for your wellbeing. Who is elder here? - Myself. Ah! Only In years. In strength, I agree you are stronger than me. Tell like that. Look, there is a charm to a battle.. Only when the opponent charges with fury and rage. The serpent God does not have anger in him. This is news to me. Narad, what should I do to get him mad with rage? Now you are listening to me. Oh! Brave warrior, who is very dear to you? Y g! Me? I am happy to hear this. If we leave me out who is dear to you? My mother. - After her? My father. - Then? My Brother. - Then? My wife. So, your wife. Let me ask you one thing. If anybody teases your wife what will you do? Who is he? Where is he? lwill kill him. Is anyone around here, friend? I questioned If your wife is teased. No one teased her. Look! Just the thought annoyed you. Now, what I am telling is. If you go and tease that Vishnu's wife. He will also get furious like you. And then your battle will be worth watching. Narada, even though you are a bachelor.. You have knowledge of many subjects. Narayan! Narayan! Narayan! Narayan! Where is she that Narayan's wife? Tell me. Tell me fast. Have patience. I will have to think. His one wife resides in his navel. She is Shreedevi. That will not help you. The other one is, look! There she is. Goddess earth! Narada, I am impressed by your smartness. Really impressed. Wait! You Goddess of earth! Lord! Narayan! Narayan! Hey! Wait! Are you the Lord Vishnu? So? You came in disguise of a pig? Aren't you ashamed? Hiranyaksha! My son! You set fire the womb that gave you birth. Did you have to face this fatal death? How will I ever survive without you, Son? Have patience, mother. Have patience. Mother, remember who are you? Wife of the great sage Kashyapursha. Having knowledge of virtue and philosophy of life. Why do you shed tears like an ignorant person? Don't you know the law of nature.. ...that man once born will have to face death. Mother, the body perishes but not this soul. My brother was not any ordinary man. Knowing that he could not be defeated in this three world. By any human form, that Hari had to come in disguise of a pig. Why do you torture yourself and.. Shed tears for a gallant man like, Hiranyaksha? Look at me. I am pleased with my brother's death. Happy! Happiness! From brother's death! Happy! Happiness! Great happiness! Immense happiness! Brother Hiranyaksha, at which spur of the moment had you vowed to pledge your life.. ...to attain universal conquest for my sake. Your brave words of facing any obstacles still echo in my ears. Just the thought of a mere pig killing a brave man.. Like you my brother boils the blood in my body. Yeh! Hari! Lord! No! No my lord! I beg of you please do not be impulsive. Do not stop me, Kayalu. Do not stop me. You will not understand my sorrow. You will not know my mother's plight. Till I kill that Hari, enemy of demons. I will not be able to rest in peace. No my Lord. Calm down calm down. With Hiranyaksha's death mother-in-law is already.. ...devastated. You please do not increase her distress and anguish. That Shrihari is not a common threat. No one has survived fighting him. No one survived fighting him? But no one can survive provoking us. My blood is boiling with rage. My body is trembling with hatred. When my body is calling out for revenge. You or even if my Grandfather Brahma comes here cannot stop me. My Lord, look at my condition. Why this hunger for battle thrusting your wife in the ocean of sorrows? What if anything goes wrong? What will happen to me? Tomorrow if my child.. Stop! You coward woman! Who am I? Three faced Lord Brahma's grandson. With a breath this Hiranyakashipu can make the three worlds quake. Being a wife of this man aren't you ashamed to shed tears like a coward? You can tell whatever you want. But I will not agree with you. Hiranyakashipu! Teacher! Teacher! You at least try to make him understand. She is right, Hiranya. Irrational decision and wrath made Hiranyaksha victim of his life. So you doubt my ability? It is of no use. What did you say? Physical strength or weapons will not help at the time of distress. First you try to meditate. Please the Gods and gain miraculous power. The three worlds should be startled by your power. Let victory be yours, my child. Mother Goddess, Let your blessings and.. Mercy be always showered on my husband. Om! Brahmadevaya! Om! Brahmadevaya! Om! Brahmadevaya Danger! Lord Devendra! Danger! Lord Devendra! Danger! Hiranyakashipu is meditating. What? ls Hiranyakashipu meditating? Yes. To get a miraculous power from Lord Brahma. If these demons get the boon from the Lord. They will directly attack the kingdom of Gods. Then Lord Indra will have to be more cautioned. We too have power with us. Lord Indra has weapon of diamond thunderbolt. Everything is there, Agni. But does not possess the will power to culminate the act that is commenced. What did you tell? Do not be impulsive. I meant to say, think before taking any decision. Agni! Lord Devendra! How come you are here? Are you surprised? My Lord is not here at the moment. Knowing that I have come here, Kayalu. You must be aware of the relation between.. ...the Gods and demons. Your husband is meditating there to seek the miraculous power.. ...from Lord Brahma to destroy us. And to destroy our peace in heaven his offspring.. ...is growing here in your womb. To stop his clan from growing any further. I have come here to destroy it at this instant. Shiva! Shiva! Are these the words of a God? What harm has this child.. ...which has still not seen the daylight clone to you, Lord Indra? Not done anything. But it might harm us in the future. Oh! Lord of Clouds, I will see to that my husband and my child will not set their eyes.. ...towards Amaravathi the abode of the Gods in the future. Please show mercy on my child. Do not kill him. Impossible! Lord Indra, I beg of you please do not kill the child that is still growing in my womb. Do not kill the only heir to this clan. Please show mercy. Please show mercy. Till I kill my enemy nothing can prevent my determination. Narayan! Narayan! Marvel! Your vigor and valor is rewarding. Possessing the thunderbolt has become worth. Why is it, honorable one? What should I stop you.. The Lord of Gods from committing a deed of a demon? Come on take the weapon and claim victory over a desolate woman. You do not understand, honorable Narad. The child growing in the Lady's womb.. ...will one day destroy us. Narayan! What can I say for your stupidity, Indra? The son which this chaste woman will give birth.. ...will bring peace and harmony to the demon world. Is it true? It is the truth. Go, first you disappear from here. Try to repent for the sin you committed. Kayalu, Kayalu. Oh Lord Shiva! Did Lord Indra try to commit such a terrifying sin? For the welfare of the Gods. Why should my grandchild who has not even opened the eyes.. ...to this world be sacrificed? Why do these immortal ones have so much.. ...hatred towards my children, Oh! Honorable one? It is not hatred, mother. It is fear. They fear that your children might harm them any time. I do not think it is safe to leave my daughter-in-law alone. Till Hiranyakashipu returns let her stay in our hermitage. No, Mother. It will be safe if she stays in our hermitage. Where there are no feelings of hatred and jealousy. And the atmosphere that is filled with religious.. ...fervor and devotion is suitable and.. Auspicious for the birth of your grandchild. Narad, I am grateful to you. Do not be so humble. We are all his followers. Everything transpires as his desires. Good luck. Mother, the soul that comes out from the cycle.. Of life and death seeks to be one with God. It should first give up worldly desires. Burn this desire of mine, me and I. The goal should be only to attain salvation. Keep faith in The God. Should always think of him and try to communicate with God. Continue, teacher. Why are you looking around? Tell me Oh! Honorable one. Kayalu! Mother is sleeping. I will listen to you. You can continue. Preach me. Narayan! Narayan! Narayan! Shrihari! Shrihari! The streams are singing with glee, Along with the flowing tide, The cool breeze is also singing, The nature has become one, And sings praise of the Lord The nature has become one, And sings praise of the Lord, Sing in praise of Lord Hari, Sway the greatness of his name, Sing in praise of Lord Hari, Sway the greatness of his name, You will get immense contentment, Oh! My child, You will get immense contentment, Oh! My child, Sing in praise of Lord Hari, Sway the greatness of his name, If called with love and devotion, He will hear you from anywhere, Like a child coming to it's mother, He will come to you, He gets defeated by true faith, And cares for his devotees, He gets defeated by true faith, And cares for his devotees, Sing in praise of Lord Hari, Sway the greatness of his name, You will get immense contentment, Oh! My child, Sing in praise of Lord Hari, Sway the greatness of his name, Sway the greatness of his name. Om! Brahmadevaya! Om! Brahmadevaya! Narayan! Narayan! Kayalu, you are very fortunate. This child will bring glory and grace to this clan. But my son has still not come back to be part of this happiness. Do not worry, mother. Your son is not an ordinary man. He is Obstinate! Till he fulfills his wishes he will not come back. This child will bring luck to all. Om! Brahmadevaya! Om! Brahmadevaya! Om! Brahmadevaya! Om! Brahmadevaya Om! Brahmadevaya! Om! Brahmadevaya! Brahmadev! Brahmadev! Today you showed mercy on me, your Grandchild. I am blessed. I am blessed seeing you, Lord! Oh! Goddess Saraswati's husband, Goddess Saraswati's dear one, Lord Brahma! One who blesses devotion, Approaching on the Swan, Oh! Merciful, I bow down to you, Oh! Merciful, I bow down to you, I pray to grant me a boon, I pray to grant me a boon, Please bless me, Please bless me, Om! Brahmadevaya! Om! Brahmadevaya. Hiranyakashipu, what is your wish? Lord, my wish? Day or night, on earth or sky, inside or outside the house, from birds, animals or trees. From insects or creepers, from weapons or words, from angels, gods, demons or other creatures. From any creature you have created, I should not get death. I would like you to grant me this wish. Of being immortal. So be it. Immortal! Immortal! Now who can match me? Where will that brave and mighty soul be in the three.. ...worlds to match a mighty man like me. Who will that be? Hey! Hari! That day you killed my brother and.. Caused misery to my mother.

Looking at my anger and hearing my roar even this poor hermit, Narad bowed down to me. Narad, in future you should sing my praises. I accept your order, my Lord. You should sing praises of my skill and valor in all the three worlds. Okay. Should always think of me. - Understood. Once again if you reminisce Lord Hari. Your skull will fly away from your head. There the story will end. Whose story? The evil's story. Dhanavendra, Hiranyakashipu I have a good news for you. What is it? Your wife Kayalu has given birth to a son in my hermitage. What? Gave birth to a son! Great! Narad, great. In this happy moment you can ask for anything you want. You should come along with me. That is all I want from you. Kalayu! My Lord! You are back! I was just talking to our son about you. He is very cute, very cute. He is just like you. No, he resembles you. Fine. He resembles both of us. Son, your birth is a good omen to me. The three-faced Lord Brahma has granted.. Me such a wonderful wish I desired. No one in the three worlds must have even dared to wish this eons. Not only that, when your son was born.. There was shower of blessings from heaven. What? Shower of flowers? At the time of my birth, the whole constellation had gone awry. The comets started flying, the thunder and lightning striked. The clouds made sacrifice of blood. The sky shook, the oceans overflowed and the earth quaked. Against of this precious ostentation. What is shower of flowers? Shameless! Shameless! Narayan'. Narayan'. - Sage Nat ad'.! Yes yes. Dhanavendra! Dhanavendhra! Next time if you utter my enemy's name. I will throw away your musical instrument. Habits. Habits died hard. Habits die-hard. Kayalu I think we have to invite Guru Shukracharya to christen our son. Narad is like our religious teacher. Why don't you ask him? Narad! Come here. What is this? I do not know whether.. You are respecting me or insulting me. By saying 'Narad, come here'. That is my specialty. Let it be. Let it be. Narad, my wife wishes that you to name should name our son. Choose a good name. Prahalad. Prahalad! A good name. A beautiful name. Narad, sometimes your intelligence shows. It all depends on time and circumstances. Looking at circumstances. ls it? My Lord, let us go back to the palace. Palace? Which palace? Narad, Narad, in the excitement of looking at the child. I did not even notice where I am standing. It's okay, Kayalu. But why did you come to this poor sage's hermitage. In your absence, that evil hearted lndra.. Had come to kill our son with his thunderbolt weapon. That moment I interfered. Sending him away by telling if the lord Hirnyakashipu becomes aware.. ...of his folly. Surely a calamity will take place. Thinking that it was not safe to keep your wife there. I brought her to the hermitage. You Indra! You have so much arrogance? Where is that God Indra? Where is he? Dhanavendra! King of Demons! Welcome! Welcome! Stop welcoming me. Calm down! Calm down! Why this anger? Brother? Shut up! Do not call me, brother. In my absence you entered my palace and tried to attack.. ...my pregnant wife to kill my child. You wicked man! It is a lie.

Now I truely understand why you scamper for the title of Lord Indra. Ramba, Urvashi, Menaka and Tilothame.. I feel our demon women are thousand times better than you. Go away! Commander! Bind all these eight Gods and bring them to my palace. Hari! You hypocrite! Magician! Where are you hiding you coward? Did you disappear looking at me coming? If have the courage in you come out and confront me. Wicked people like you cannot see him. Who told that? You! Poisonous snake! I will kill you. The one filled with venom in every breath. It is you or I? I would have slit you apart with raging that is mounting in me. As I have come here to kill Lord Hari and.. ...l do not want to be disgraced by killing you instead. Go!

From now I am the Lord of the universe. Great news! Great news! Auspicious words! What is this? The Gods from heaven are here. They are defeated and have become my prisoners. This had to occur. It had to occur. But? What is it? If you imprison the Gods of the nature. What will be the plight of the universe? Am I not here? What is the use if you being here, Danavendra? I mean can you bring rain from time to time? Can you be air and bring gentle wind? Can you smolder like fire? True. True. I did not think of this. What will I do now, Narad? As it is the Nature's Gods have been defeated.. ...and have been your prisoners. Enough! Now you release them. Let them work under your command holding their usual position. You are right. Commander, release them. Narad! Come here. Do you have any hidden motive in this? Lord Hat. Lord Hat. No'. No'. Demon Lord'.! How can it be possible? How can it be possible What not?

Yes, my child. He is the Lord of the Universe. And he is also the God to it. Do not hurt his feelings. Agree to this. To keep one's heart. Can one make a lie as truth, mother? Do you think of yourself as great honest person? Have you become big enough to advise your father? Remember, you were born after me. I gave you birth. You are not even big enough to look upto the sky. And you dare to advise this Lord of the Universe. How can I advise you, my father? Then you have to do as I say. Your command, my father. I am father of Universe, I am creator of the Universe and I am the only God. The God is eternal. I have gained victory over death. When we cannot control our own mind. How could we have control over death, father? Kayalu! Kayaly he is not any ordinary boy. He is a sworn enemy born to me. Do you know who his God is? That coward who had slyly killed my brother in disguise of a pig. My great enemy, Hari. Hari is not an enemy. He is not a cheat. He is the father to this universe. I am the father of this Universe. I do not know which evil spirit has entered your heart. It is not demon it is Lord Shrihari. Commander, take him away. And show him the treatment the Lord Hart's devotees get from us. My Lord, this is injustice. I did not punish your son. He should be aware of the consequences.. ...if he goes against my wish. Prahalaad, Our's is Demon kingdom. If any one goes against us they will not survive. You listen to me Prince. Why don't you forget about Lord Hari? Will you agree if I tell you to give up this Lord Hari's world? So?

Narayan! Harinarayan! Narayan! Harinarayan! Narayan! Harinarayan Narayan! Harinarayan. Hari! My Lord, Prahalaad is not an ordinary child. When he started singing Lord Hari's song.. ...the weapons fell off from our hands. And started torturing us, my Lord. Torturing us. Torture! Hari's devotion! Yes father. The only thing I know is devotion to Lord Hari. Drag him away from here. Throw him into the cell and starve him without food and water. Till he realizes that Hari's devotion will not sate.. ...his hunger, keep him there. No my Lord. This is not justice to punish an innocent child like him. Innocent child! Kayalu, the poison must be removed from the roots. If ignored we will be the cause of our own destruction. Calm down. I will talk to him and make him understand. Narayan! Narayan! Child Prahalaad, you are still a kid. You have to live a long life. Do not be a prey to the wrath of your elders. Children should always listen to their father. It is for their wellbeing. Tell mother. I will listen. Did you see? Did you see? Did you hear his words? Whatever you say he will not refuse. Tell. Tell as much as you want. Will you listen to me, my son? Yes father. Tell Om Namaha Hiranyakashipaya. Om Namaha Narayanaya. Kayalu! Kayalu! He is not born as a.. ...son to me but as an enemy to this dynasty. No my Lord! No! Mahendra! Yes Lord. Mahendra, sever him with your thunderbolt. No my Lord. No. He was the one who came to eliminate your dynasty. And now if you ask him to kill Prahalaad. Will he keep quiet? Do not fear that, mother. Time changes everyone and no one remains the same. That imprudent lndra.. ...who tried to commit a sin is different from this man.. ...who is shattered and defeated. Dhanavendra, do not be so cruel to kill your own son. I do not want your advice. Will you kill him or not? No. I cannot do that. Can't do? In my absence you could come to destroy.. ...my child growing in my wife's womb. Today, when I order you to kill my son, you do not obey my command. Dhanavendra, I am paying the price by loosing my identity and serving you.. ...for the sin I tried to commit that day. And if I kill your son I do not what calamity I will have to face. No it is not possible by me. No. You can't? Then get lost from here. Fire! Fire, take this Prahalaad in yours arms and blaze him. Even his ashes should not be seen around. My Lord! - Hiranyakashipu, ...please do not take hasty decision in anger. Then even if you regret you will not get your son back. Not needed. I am giving this order so that he does come back. My Lord! Finished! Everything has come to an end. In my rule the chanting of Lord Hari's name is totally wiped out. Can anyone destroy your disciple, Can the flames burn, Can anyone destroy your disciple, Can the flames burn, The soul that hums Hari! Hari! The soul that hums Hari! Hari!

Dear! Are you alive my child? Yes mother. Didn't the fire burn you? No mother. My dear. Mother, no harm can be caused to the soul.. ...that is absorbed with Lord Narayan. Father, Shrihari is the protector. He is almighty. If you stop your hatred and show faith in him. What? I should show faith in him? Commander! Drag him out of here. It is enough if you bring me the news of his death. Take him away. No, My Lord. I will not let to leave him. What? You will not leave? My Lord! Oh! Mother Goddess, my baby's safety is in your hands. HE is innocent. Unnecessarily he is been target of his father's wrath. For showing his faith in Lord Hari. It is your responsibility to show my husband right path. And save my child.

You? What? Are you the son whom I gave birth to? Are you the boy whom I raised? Do you have any doubt? Your deeds and behaviour puts me in doubt. Why? What sin have I committed? You are not same after you got the boon from Lord Brahma. You behave like the Lord of the universe. So? What is wrong in that? You are filled with arrogance and conceit. Let it. There is no shade of compassion in your eyes. It is filled with brutality. Let it show. Why did you order to kill your own son? He is my enemy. What did you tell? Enemy? ls he not your son? He who does not show respect to the father cannot be a son. He is an enemy. Then? He will also be an enemy who does not regard his mother. What did you tell?

Fire did not burn you, elephant did not crush you.. ...and the snakes did not bite you. No, no. I will not give you my son. It is not his fault. Nobody is guiding him. It is his stars making him do that. My Lord, my heart is breaking looking and hearing the way you are.. ...torturing and putting him in agony. My Lord, you have to kill me first. I cannot see my son die when I am alive. I cannot see. I cannot see my child's death. Who am I? Son of Kashyap Brahma. Grandson of three faced Lord Brahma. A great hero who has fought death. A great conqueror having triumph over the Gods. A brave man taking hold over the three worlds. With my one stride the earth slits open. When I lift my head the sky shivers with fear and.. .With the snap of my fingers the universe trembles. When the Brahma's universe is comply with me. My small child, the son I gave birth to go against me. The son who has to take ahead my lineage. What is this life where there is no happiness from the offspring? What worth is my life? This worthless life. I think I am the almighty. What evil-spirit is causing trouble? That has made my son my enemy. Which strength is making him fight me? What is that which protects him from death? What is it that is making me hang my head down in shame? Yes. It's him. That Hari! My enemy is the cause to all this. Where are you Hari? Hypocrite! Sinner! You possess my son's heart and mind and take revenge. If you are a man enough an eternal man like me. Come! Stand in front of me. If I do not tear open your stomach and wear your intestine as my wreath. My name is not Hiranyakashipu. lam not Hiranyakashipu! Sit down.. Kayalu what were you thinking so intently looking at your son? Have I hurt your feelings? No! No my Lord. I have given you lot of sorrows. No my Lord. Why are you talking like this? I felt like that. Kayalu, do you love me very much? Of course, My Lord. Who else is there for me? You are my life and my happiness. You are my God. I know that. Will you do as I order you? Your command is my wish, my Lord. It is a wife's duty to obey her husband's command. Yes my Lord. It is her duty. Yes, it is her responsibility too. Take this. It is poison. Should I drink this? No. You should give it to the person I tell. With your hands you should feed this to Prahlaad. L'; Yes. With your hands you should feed this to Prahlaad. You should serve it to Prahlaad! Aren't you a pious woman? Don't you know that you should not disobey your husband? Go! Go! Go give him this poison. My Lord, why do you test me like this? I think you must be joking. No mother in this world must have fed poison to her child. That is why I am ordering you to do this. You have to do that work. You have to feed him poison. Why don't you do this? If I could. Why would I order you to do it? Do you know the consequence of this? What will happen? The stigma of murder of the son by a mother will.. ...remain till the sun and moon are in this universe. And the dishonor of going against the husband's.. ...wishes will also come to you, Kayalu. I have borne him, my Lord. I have borne him. Are you the only one with love for your son? Am I heartless? For which mistake of mine you are punishing me? For bearing a son like him. Tell Kayalu, tell Kayalu can't you do this work? Mother! Mother! Mother, why are you like this? Mother, what happened? Why are you crying, Mother? For being born as a woman. For the mistake of bearing a son like you. What wrong have I done? You worshipping Lord Hari is only wrong. Whom should I worship? Worship your father. Is he greater than Lord Narayan? You should not ask all those questions. Your father is The God. And he is the Lord of universe. You mean father does not have birth and death? Prince! Tell mother. Mother, one without birth and death is Lord of universe. One without thirst and hunger is the God. One without beginning and end is eternal. And that Lord Pareshmar is in every living being. The Lord Narayan is only true and everlasting. I do not have as much knowledge like you, my child. This mother's wish is that you should live forever. With your blessings I will surely live, Mother. No my child. Your mother has come as death to you. Your father has ordered me to serve you poison. Is it, mother? How can a hand that fed milk give poison? Can a mother who gave birth to a child give it death? No, whatever you give will be ambrosia. Give mother, I will happily drink. No, child no. Look at me. Don't you have pity for your mother's tears? For my sake, for your father's satisfaction. One time only one time, tell that he is the God. How is that possible, mother? In every drop of my blood, in every cell of my body. And In every breath I take when Lord Hari is residing. How can I forget him, Mother? Will he like if I lie? Instead, I prefer drinking this poison. Prahalaad! Prahalaad! Prahalaad! Didn't the poison harm you? Didn't the poison harm you? It did not do anything. It did not do anything. Whom the fire could not burn him. The snakes could not bite him and the elephants could not trample him. Kayalu, I am a fool to even think.. ...that poison you gave would kill him. Kayalu, in this world there is nothing more important than Mother. Not even God. I thought for your sake for the sake of your tears.. ...your son would stop worshipping Hari. Your tears could not move him. Everything went wrong. He is not an ordinary boy. He is a brute who has come to make his father a murderer. If it is destined for the father to kill his son. No one can stop that. My Lord! - Go away. Prince! Prahalaad! Child, why are you being so stubborn. When the whole heaven and Gods shiver with fright seeing your father. Why do you have faith in that invisible Hari, which you don't show to your who is father visible to you? IS there any other father other than the biological one? Isn't there? No, no. There can be no other Gods. I am the father of this universe. Father, it is true that you gave birth to me. Who gave birth to you? My father, Kashyapa Brahma. His father? Chaturmukh Brahma. His father? Why are you quiet, father? Who was Brahma's father? There should be someone. Who is he? He is Shriman Narayan. Narayan!! You foolish kid, Do not repeat again, Or I will slit the tongue, That says Hari's name, He is my sworn enemy, He is my sworn enemy I promise you, I will kill him Tell me where is he, Show him to me. The sky is his face, The Sun and Moon his eyes, Planets and stars his ornaments, Thunder and lightening his smile, Universe his body, In the netherworld are his feet. In the netherworld are his feet, In front of the ruler of universe, You are telling Hari is the Universe, If he has the spirit let him face me, I will trample his head. I believe in faith, You believe in strength, I will call him with love, You call with hatred, Hari is filled in both of us, If I call out he will surely come. Coward who ran away, Hearing my footsteps, Will he come if you call? He is a woman in man's disguise, Does he have brave heart of a man? Does he have brave heart of a man? Does he have? There is no one like Hari, Enmity with Hari is not good, There is no one above him, Without Hari we will not get salvation, No salvation, No salvation. Enough! Shut up! Are you trying to frighten me with.. ...your empty talks of faith and salvation? Why are you tearing your throat calling Hari! Hari! Tell me where is he? He is all over. In every small things. Living and non -living things. There is no place without him. In every place? In every atom of the universe? Yes, he is there. - On this earth? Yes, he is there also. - In the sky Yes. In fire. Yes he is there. In water? - Yea he is there. In air? Yes he is there In me? - Yes he is there "1 you? Yes he is there Yes yes. He might be in you. He surely might. Is he inside this palace? Yes.

Yes he is. In this pillar? - Yes. IN that pillar? - Yes. In this pillar? Yes he is there. In this pillar - Yes. HE is there also. Great! Prince Prahalaad! Great! You truly are a stubborn boy.
