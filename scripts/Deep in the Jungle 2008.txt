The old enemy turned into a future foe. When the last war arrives, who will win the fight? Who will have love remaining at the end, to be united as one? Ohm... the goddess of the river, and the god of the wind, when will you unite dream and reality? Remember, all folks of the river. The ancestor's cave is the place of birth and death for us... The Nagas. Ohm... The human body is just a vessel. Remember, the last siblings of our tribe, once you reach the age of 19, the day nine planets become aligned in the sky, both of you must unite into one. Cast off the human body and return to the homeland, through the ancestor's cave. DEEP IN THE JUNGLE Every time I open my eyes, I feel like a dead person. The past. The present. The dream. They are not much different. I fight to survive. But I don't know how long it will last. How far is it by walking from here? Walk across a hill 3 clicks, you'll be there. Bravo Bravo 211, this is India Shield Lima 13. We're approaching our destination. Requesting mission confirmation. Over. Bravo 211. Confirming the mission. Over. Copy that. I'm still alive. But what am I living for? Wow! A new model, isn't it? Do you know how to use it? Put the gun down, you sons of bitches! Put it back! Put it back! Sorry, sir. Go get those two freaks from the cage. Hurry up. Come out here. Come. What's going on? Go check over there. There they are. Go and see who the hell they are. You have the mission at Pao's camp, right? They are running over there. Go! Wait. Captain. Bravo 211. Abort the mission. Over Requesting command to abort mission. Over. Repeat. Abort the mission. Over. Shit! Get her out of here. Hurry up! Come on. Move it. Move it! Besiege them! Don't let them cross the Thai border. Sommai, come on. Sommai, come on. Get up. You should leave me here. I won't make it. - We're almost at the border, Sommai. - I can't go any further. Come on. You must go home with me. Hang on. Let's go, Boo. Boo! Boo! Boo! All right. Get the women up here first. Quick! Come on. You fool! Get down. Get down. Quick. - Get down here. Down here. - Go on. Hurry up. Get up there. Go. Get up there. Come on. Up there. - Jai! Go! Jin! Jai! Jin! Jin! Jai! How do you feel? Is it still painful? Let me see your wound. It's a little infected. I'll give you an injection. Give me your arm. I wonder which room is Captain Nawin's. Just a moment, please. We'll change a car at the troop. What happened to the rest of us? All killed. They were all killed. I really want to know what the damn is going on. I think you'd better hide out in Burma. How was the chief? Chief? They got him first. I think we might have stepped on somebody's toes. Brother, you should go across the border and keep a low profile. You go ahead. I've got unfinished business with my old friend. Find me a phone. Well. You can take my satellite phone. If you have any problem, call Sergeant Dang. Samut Sakhon police busted into sweat shop factory, found hundred of alien workers trapped in the cramped cellar. Some of them had severe fever without any treatment. Human trafficking situation in the country is getting worst. Criminal gangs smuggle illicit alien workers, across the border into the territory. Go get a tranquillizer, and bring some help! All right. Hold her to the bed. Hold her down. Any news, Sarge? Thank you. - Hello? - I've found what you are looking for. Are you sure this is it? Sarge. It's me. Could you check it for me, who is the last incoming number to this phone? Catch her! I've checked it out. That recent call in Manus' phone was from the hospital. Give me a lighter. Colonel. What is that damn thing is? Sarge... Shit! Because of her, I am bound to the present, but also drawn back to the past. Who is she? You know. You are the only team that I trust. Yes Sir. And... remember. ...only female. OK. I 'll keep more time. Don't missed it again. Thank you. Here. Who are you? I'm Nawin. And who are you? Jin. What? Jin. Damn Nawin! You die hard bastard. Colonel, your father is on the line. My father died a long time ago. Hello? Well, Manus. Don't you remember your father? What's up, brother? You haven't contacted me for a long time. I thought you'd forgotten me. It looks like I got what you'd dropped. What a shame. You traveled so far just to get it. Hey, wait, wait. Is she with you? What are you talking about? My boss will only accept her alive. Who ordered the front command unit to abort the mission? Who are you working for? Send your damn boss to me, you son of a bitch. Isn't it too much, brother? Everything is about the mission. Remember? Nothing personal about it. Let's make it easy. You bring her back to me. Take the money and forget all of this. Manus. Listen to me carefully, human life is priceless. Besides, don't use the mission as an excuse. Your dirty damn work... is not for our country. My work is more important than yours. Not to mention other works in my head. My boss won't give a damn about an insect like you. We'd better do it this way. Let's talk nicely. I'm willing to pay as much as you want. How is your mother, Manus? I hardly remember the first day you volunteered into the army. Dumb and stupid. But... I really wonder, what makes you come this far? You'd better shut up if you know nothing about it. Tell me, where is that bitch? I want to listen to your pathetic philosophy. So enlighten me. Well, why don't you say something? Colonel, it's me. Damn it! Manus, you bastard! We can talk. Tell me what I want to know. You can't do anything about it anyway. What has the girl got to do with it? It... It's not human. Don't shoot me, man. Don't shoot me. I have something to show you. It's over there. Believe me. Here! See it with your own eyes. This mission has been going on for a long time. I'm not the first commander of this unit. Those Americans are willing to pay a bundle for it. Most importantly, they'd give us everything we want. Tell you what, your secret operation in Burma is also involved. We exchange information all the time. Nawin, it is not human. It looks like us just by appearance. But it is an animal. You'd better send it to me. Then our conflict is over. If you don't want any money, I'll help you with your rank. We can be soldiers together again. I'm a real soldier. But you are not! No! Stop it! Stop. You stop right there. He's really gonna shoot me. Put the gun down. Put it down. I said put the gun down. Fear makes us weak. But what is it that makes us fear? Is it the truth? Jin! Jin. I believe that all the things happening in this world, are not coincidences. Why did we have to meet right here and now? Yeah? I have something to ask you. Have you ever heard of the S21 code? Sarge! Where are you now? This is not your personal business anymore. Can you come and see me? It's Nawin. Stop the vehicle right there and get out. You are not alone. Who is she? She's involved with the S21 code. Can you show me her wrist? Keep walking for 100 meters and you'll see the entrance. Captain Nawin. Army Cadet class '30. Your last record, died during a SEAL training exercise at Kram Island, Sattahip Naval base. Not actually, you are Major Tang-Rai, an officer of the Muang Tai armed forces. The Burmese intelligence unit knows you very well under the code name "Garuda 28" And that's not all. But Por-Sangkia is your other name a boy who strayed across the Thai border with an ill old monk on pilgrimage. Finally, you were adopted by a westerner in Chiang Mai, who sent you to school until you graduated from cadet academy. It seems you know me very well. What about you, Sarge? In fact, Sergeant Dang is my code name. It started in 1969 at Long Jang. As a CIA secret unit for a secret war in Laos, we didn't call each other by our real names. No one remembers us. We don't exist in this world. And you know it. What did they tell you on the day you enrolled in the unit? "You are a dead person." Are you hungry, girl? Yes. Delta Alpha 333, repeat. Delta Alpha 333. I need a back up troop, from your responsible area immediately! Parts of S21 started in the middle of the World War II. There were English soldiers cutting the road to the village in Burma, deep into the Chinese border. They accidentally found an unknown tribe, and recorded their mysterious story. In a deep cave, there were carcass of large-size animals, like snakes. The weird thing was, their skulls were very similar to human's. Villagers believed that was the holy Naga god. The English soldiers' record would have been just nonsense, if there had not been the incident 30 years later. The CIA trainers sent to arm weapons for a minority living along the Chinese-Burmese border found the tribe again. They brought some of them back to Thailand by helicopter. The blood sample was sent to the lab in America. American scientists discovered that their genetic cells, can be mutated for survival. You are good at story telling, Sarge. I happened to be on that helicopter. According to the History of Buddha, there was a group of people asking for ordination. He didn't give His permission though they had deep faith in His teaching. That's because they were animal. With the pity He had for them. The Buddha ordered anyone to call a person who is entering monkhood after their name. Naga. That's right. Naga. They can transform into humans like us. The secret hidden in their genes is what the Americans want. That blood test case was called... ...S21. The tribe later disappeared from the forest. They can't find them, no matter how hard they try. Until they had some clues of the POW captured by the Red Wa tribe. At Pao Yo Sang camp. Right. Whatever the reason is, it might be destiny that brought you there. Have you ever thought that... everything that happens in this world is not a coincidence? Whatever it is, her life is in your hands now. It's up to you whether you want her to live or die. We are not the only species in this world. So we shouldn't assume to be the owner of it. No one has more rights than others. They're here sooner than I expected. Take this and get out of here. It's very important. Jin! Hold on. This way. Thanks a lot, Sarge. Jin. Let's go! You got here very quickly. But it's too late. I'll tell you something. Greenhorns like you fools never catch Nawin up. Hey, Tor. I'll meet you at the Burmese border. It's a long story. I'll tell you tomorrow. Go around and trap them. Hey! I want her alive. Leave no stone unturned. Are you tired? No, sir. I can't hear you! Louder! No, sir. I don't care wherever you're from. But we don't want any violence here. Come on. Let me help. Here. Colonel. We've just got Nawin's phone signal. Pao Yo Sang. We need your support immediately. Hunter Yoi. No... Wait. I haven't had a chance to say thank you for sparing my life. This bitch is damn good. You went through here just because of her. You animal. Sorry, I'm not. But your goddamn girl surely is. This garuda has been with you for too long! What the hell is that thing? It's over there. Holy god of the jungle, please help me. Are there any survivors? It is all my fault. Please find me a car. I might catch them before they come across the Thai border. Soldier... they did not take her away. She went with her people. "Take this and get out of here. It is very important." Get ready to mobilize. Let's go. Come on! Come on! Nawin! Are you okay? It can't possibly work, soldier. We are different species. She must go back with me! You have to choose... My sister's soulless body... ...or let us be on our way. Remember, the human body is just a vessel. Must unite into one. Cast off the human body. They are in the cave. Hurry up! No, you go first. Don't quarrel. Both of you! When will you quit messing with me, you son of a bitch? Do you really think you are so good? I've wasted too much time on you. Let's finish it off today! Please. Please. Don't leave me like this. Everything passed by, leaving behind only the remains of memory. Yes. I'm still alive, only to think of Jin. I know she's still alive and living happily somewhere out there.
