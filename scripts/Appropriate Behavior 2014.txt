Not really. Like when we'd go to parties and there was dancing, we'd start dancing and everyone would make a circle around us and watch us dance. Okay. Okay, why don't you tell me what you need, Shirin? I need my girlfriend back. Dude, I really think you just need to mourn this and move on. I really want to eat my feelings right now. You know what? I think that's an amazing idea. Why don't we order all the fatty, disgusting foods we never let ourselves eat? Okay. Hey, girls. How you doin' today? Hey. Fantastic. And you? Uh, what's your name? Brendan. Brendan. Hey, I'm crystal. Hey, crystal. What can I get you today? Um, let me see. I would love an... Unsweetened glass of iced tea. No problem. Thank you. And can I just have one of those complimentary mints I saw by the entrance and a glass of ice water and a little bit of lemon in there. Okay. Thank you so much. Thanks, Brendan. Mmm, delish. Mmm, can't wait. I'm dead inside. Can you tell just by looking at me that I'm dead inside? I really think you had to end it. I mean, she wasn't even fucking you towards the end. Maybe it was a phase. Thanks, Brendan. How about "Giraffe"? What about "safe word"? Like the word "safe word" as our safe word? Let's cut out the middleman, 'cause what happens if you forget your safe word? Okay, then, the safe word is "safe word." Great. Let's do this. What's the scenario? I'm your tax auditor. Okay. Miss? Yes? Can you please fill out this form? All right. Miss? Yes? I've been a bad small-business owner. What seems to be the problem? I don't have any of my receipts from June until August, and I'm gonna have to be punished. That's actually easily remedied. If you'll just fill in the larger expenses in Section C and cross-check them with Section B. Maxine. What? You are killing the sexy. I'm just-- I'm not into role play. That's-- that's okay. I'm vanilla. Don't say that. It true. I'm not kinky. Hey. Look at me. I like vanilla. I'm not really in the mood. I'm sorry. It's okay. Banal sex shouldn't start until at least a year into a relationship. I moved in too soon. When are you going back to work? I'm not. No! The only reason they hired me in the first place is 'cause they wanted a middle eastern person on staff. Now that Yahveh's in editorial, everyone's gushing over how Syrian she is. I'm not letting you fall into a bottomless pit of despair and unemployment on my couch. Nothing brings me joy. Well... I think this guy I know is hiring. Let me talk to him. And are you gonna go look at that apartment in Bushwick later? I can't. I have to go see my parents. Oh, my God! Can I come? Your dad is so hot. I just want to, like, paint him. Ugh, no. That is exactly why you cannot come. So, uh... So, in the afternoon, I took an appendix, and I rewired it on this kid who had no control of his own urine. Stop. Wow. No, no, no, we made him dry. But now he has to pee out of his belly button. Please stop. This is fascinating. Not while we're eating. Yeah, it can wait until after, right? Okay. Did you see Ali's picture of the sex-reassignment surgery? No, I didn't, 'cause I deleted it the minute I read "intestine vagina" in the subject. They're interesting pictures. Yeah, they are. Show them. Please don't do this. I don't understand why he had to go into urology. It's because he loves the penises so much. Funny, dad. Here you go. Check it out. Ugh! Oh, my God. What? Take a look at it. You're not even looking at it. Please put that away. I don't want to see it. She doesn't want to see it. Put it away. Okay, suit yourself. Layli. Yes? Ali says that you just started your fellowship. That's right. Plastic surgery. Mm-hmm. Isn't it weird, though? Like, he's dealing with life-and-death situations every day, and then you're with these middle-aged housewives with low self-esteem. Layli is a pediatric reconstructive plastic surgeon. I actually-- Uh, I specialize in burn treatment and skin grafting. Cool. I heard you are working at "The Brooklyn Paper." Yeah. Um, I'm actually thinking about transitioning into another field. So, let me get this straight. You got a masters in journalism, and now you're gonna do Jack shit with it? She can still use her degree. She's so talented. Thank you. She was the only freshman in high school who could swim on the varsity team. And she didn't even take lessons. Wow, that's a real resume builder right there. Yeah, this body's made for swimming. Look at these shoulders. That's enough. Thank you. And look at those hands. Please stop. Aren't they stunning? They're beautiful hands. You know, you should get into hand modeling. Ah. But I just don't know how people get started. It's who you know. A masters in journalism, that's how you get started. I would literally like to talk about anything else. Okay, how's your love life? Any boys we should know about? No. No boys at all. Oh, thank God I don't have to get my shotgun ready then. Good one, dad. Oh, God. Ken? Hey. Ginny. Shirin. Shirin. What is that? Libyan? Armenian? Argentinean? Iranian. Oh, Iranian. Wow. Iran. What do you think of that whole situation? It's a mixed bag. A lot of very good-intentioned people dealing with some difficult circumstances. You get over there very often? Yeah. Actually, I go in the summers to visit family. Wow. Okay, so tell me, what is the scene like in Tehran? I just read this big article about the underground hip-hop scene in "Vice." Yeah. So, you're part of that? No. Unfortunately, I spend most of my time in Iran watching Disney videos with my grandmother while she untangles jewelry. Yeah, I got myself some coffee. Do you want something to drink? No, thanks. I am buzzed on skunk right now. Nice. So, crystal tells me you are an artist. Yes. Yeah, I am. You're a video artist. Mm-hmm. Great. So, I don't know what crystal has told you, but I'm looking for someone reliable to take over an afterschool filmmaking class. It's with a bunch of kids, and they're really great and so smart and, uh, just creative. And really, all you have to do is just show them how to hold a camera. I can do that, yeah. So, what is your schedule like? Completely open. Perfect. All right, well, may I say let's do this? Okay. Great. Don't fuck me over. Okay. You told him I was a filmmaker? You said you needed a job. How do you know this guy anyway? He's that investment banker in my parents' building I used to hook up with in high school. Oh, my God. He's that guy. Mm-hmm. Yeah, so he lost his job, became a stay-at-home dad, and got into light drugs. Good for him. So, do you have a lesson plan? What is this, Germany? They're park slope teens. I could lock 'em in a room with a half-eaten apple and a tic tac and come back to the "Mona Lisa." Wh-- why are we stopping? Oh, I have to take care of something. You wait out here. No, no, no, wait. Oh, please don't do this. You said that no amount of wholesale spelt Sushi was worth the emotional toll of being here. She's here all the time. They don't even offer paper bags. It's surprising how, uh, lonely it gets when you're single again, especially when you live with someone. You get so used to their habits and their lifestyle and their smells, but, um, I really joined the co-op to spend time with her, 'cause, let's be honest, it's not the most pleasant place to work in the world. But if I really want Maxine back in my life, I'm gonna have to do whatever it takes, and that means getting back onto her co-op shift, and that's where you come in. It-- it says in your file that you haven't worked a shift in four months. Extenuating circumstances. I've had a very broken heart. Look, all members are entitled to one free pass after a delinquency, but I cannot get you onto her shift. It's all booked. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Jackie. Hi, Jackie. Um... The last time I checked, this is a cooperative. Why don't you go ahead and cooperate with me, and I'll cooperate with you. But how do you get them so curly? Let's go. It was so nice meeting you. Shirin told me you're an artist. Landscaping or portraits? I specialize in experimental installations, and Jacques is currently focusing on sandcastle work integrating found objects. We're done with the boxes. I'm coming. It was so nice meeting you. There's no toilet paper. Hey, you guys can go. I feel like I'm 17 and you're moving me back into college. I wish. That dorm was much nicer. This is what it is to find a place on short notice in Brooklyn. At least you have a sexy roommate. Felicia? I find her a bit terrifying. No, I'm talking about the boy-- Jacques. Your new roommates are freaks. Hey, is this how you say hello? Hi. Can we tell her? Tell me what? I'm proposing to Layli. Why? Hey. Shirin. I'm not saying you shouldn't do it. It's just... He's very young. He's 33. I was only 19 when I married your father. Well, this isn't the Islamic Republic of Iran, mom. Do you see a hijab on my head? What is wrong with you? Nothing. You're acting like a brat. Stop it. You're bringing a lot of negative energy into my new home. Oh, this is not a home. This is a refugee camp. Seriously, what are you doing here? You don't know what a cool Brooklyn loft looks like. I just don't understand why you left your old apartment. The neighborhood was so much better. It got too expensive. We would have helped you. This is my new home, and I love it. Okay. Ali, come. Help me in the kitchen. Okay, but I'm not touching anything. I'm sure the girl who let me in has hep c. Dad? Yeah? I'm worried about Ali. I think he's jumping into marriage because he thinks he has to. He's got classic older child syndrome. He'll do anything to make you and mom happy. She has no goals or aspirations. She takes nothing seriously. She's becoming a loser. Lower your voice. She has this, like, younger child thing. I'm telling you, you need to be on top of that. You don't think I'm doing my best? She's not easy. He's, like, burying his emotions deep beneath the surface, and, like, one day, he could pull a gun on his coworkers. I think she has self-esteem issues. Yeah, no kidding. When was the last time she had a boyfriend? That Virginia tech kid was just trying to please his strict Korean parents. It's not like she's dumb or super unattractive. I mean, she's perfectly capable of being normal. I don't want him to find himself, like, ten years from now, fat, bald, and in a loveless marriage because he was rushing to become the world's best Iranian son. The men in our family don't go bald. Oh, I don't need new reading material. I'm only up to book two of the "Twilight" series. I'm broadening your horizons. This is some pretty serious stuff here. I'm asking you to read some books. You don't need to get your septum pierced. Yet. Oh, hey. Um, excuse me, this is actually the Brooklyn kids movie maker class. I think you have the wrong room. No, this right. I'm a movie director. See you at five. And I'm gonna poop. No! Don't! Kujo, could you please hold-- Put down the truck and hold the camera. Stop throwing. I don't think you can fit it all. Hey, Kujo, the lens is way too close to your butt. Oh, you're on OkCupid. My taxidermist met her husband on that site. I'm just looking for someone to make my girlfriend jealous. We're on a break. Good luck. Felicia? Yes? You're in a long-term, seemingly healthy relationship. Can you tell me, how do people meet, agree they like each other, and then... keep on liking each other? Shared interests? Jacques and I met at occupy Chelsea. I'm gonna lie here and try to forget what it felt like to be loved. Could you please turn off the light? Feel better. Thank you. Hey. Hi. You want a cigarette? I don't smoke. Yeah, me neither. What are you doing out here? Social anxiety. What about you? More or less the same. I'm Shirin. Maxine. It's nice to meet you. I love dykes. Nice. I mean it. You know that-- that word is incredibly offensive. Oh, I'm bisexual, so it's okay if I say it. No, it's still offensive. You know how I meant it. Doesn't matter how you meant it. Tomato, to-mah-to. What are you drinking? I filled this water bottle with Tequila. Classy. I'm drinking with a purpose. Yeah? This guy with whom I recently had an unfortunate sexual encounter showed up, and now I feel uncomfortable. I just hate the way dudes get when they can't maintain an erection. What do they get like? Oh, are you a gold star? No, I've had sex with men, just, um, not the kind who go soft. Touche. It's the worst. They shut down, and they get all mopey and offended when you make jokes. Yeah, it's so weird the way men don't enjoy humor at the expense of their penises. Do you want some? Sure. I think you're hot. Thanks. I know that I don't look like I'm into girls and that I was just talking about being a boner killer, but I am super sexy and super into girls. Really? Yeah. I like girls like you. Like me? You know, like, manly, but also a little bit like a lady. Nice. Thank you. Um... Are you having lady problems? What makes you think I'm having lady problems? Because it's new year's Eve and you're heading out before the countdown. Maybe I'm heading out to meet the person I'm gonna kiss at midnight. You're gonna be hella late 'cause it's like, two minutes away. What's her name? Linda. She sounds like a cunt. We're going out for a couple months, and we decided to move in together. Naturally. And four days after I break my lease and sell everything I own, she tells me she misses her ex, and what the fuck am I supposed to do with that information? That sucks. Just having trouble dealing with, like, Brooklyn parties and everyone talking about their Kickstarter campaigns, and did you see that guy with the waxed Dali mustache? I mean, what the fuck is that guy's problem? Who the fuck does he think he is? I find your anger incredibly sexy. Really? I hate so many things too. Wow. Ken. Hi. Oh! Hey, hi. How are you? I'm good, thank you. Carrington, this is Shayla. I'm Shirin. Hi. Oh... Sorry, man. I'm stoned. Oh, that's okay. Want a j? No, I'm cool. Thanks. Listen, um... I'm a terrible teacher. No. Yes, I am. Uh, the kids hate me. They're a good ten years younger than I thought they'd be, and I can't get them to listen. You can't take it personally, dude. They're five. I don't know what I'm doing. I have three kids. I don't know what I'm doing. It's just fake it 'til you make it. I've lost Carrington, like, what, four times? Right, bro? Just do your best, okay? Okay. Hey. I believe in you, Cher. Thank you. They have no idea you're bisexual? I'm sorry, what country is it that you get stoned to death if you're convicted of being gay? Oh, yeah. Wait, I know. It's Iran, the country that my entire family comes from. You can't keep playing the Persian card every time we have an argument. You need to see for yourself how difficult it is to be the child of immigrants. I would love to. Great. Then you're coming to a Persian new year party this weekend in New Jersey. Am I coming as your date? God, no. You're definitely coming as my white friend. Do you think I have a death wish? You know you're gonna have to wear a dress. No. Good. Now you're gonna send 'em? Yes. It's like we just stepped into Liberace's wet dream. Isn't it spectacular? You know I don't like being in enclosed spaces where I can't detect any visibly gay people. Well, I'm pretty sure Uncle Neema's harboring some bi-curious tendencies. You talk to him about it? Oh, God, no. Persians communicate mostly through gossip. Shirin? Oh, my God! Hi! Hi! Hi! Maxine, this is Mitra, Yassi, Meenu, and Yassi. Guys, this is my friend Maxine. Hey. Hey. Oh, my God, you look amazing. Right. Next to you, I look like a busboy from chili's. Oh, no way. You're practically a model. Yeah, you're right. Like a "before" model for Accutane. Uh, I would kill for your height. And I would sell my firstborn for your skin. Stop it. You stop it. We need to get together more. I haven't seen you since your grandmother's funeral. How's your father? You know, he's okay, but then sometimes he'll cry out of nowhere, and I'll be like, "dad, what's going on with you? You're emasculating yourself." Oh, my God! Roya? What just happened? You were in the middle of a sentence. Yeah, every time I see her, she compliments the way I look, she asks one personal question, and then she walks away while I answer. And who's she talking to now? That's Roya. Her father just made a lot of money importing samovars. Let's get a drink. When are they serving dinner? Midnight. Seriously? God, you know, I should have talked about her dad's cosmetic dental practice. You were being honest. Do you think they want you to be honest at these things? Oh, get a grip. You're a grown woman. You've been to how many parties in your life? I don't know. A lot. And what's the most important part of having a good time at a party? Drinking. And? Dancing. And who's very good at both of those things? I am. That's right. Two vodka tonics, please. That was amazing. I've never had so much fun around Persians before. I'm sorry, I know you're having a breakthrough, but can you first explain to me this fire thing? Yeah. So, the Wednesday before Noruz, you're supposed to jump over fire to exorcise yourself of evil spirits and start the new year fresh. Only we're doing it now 'cause everyone had work and we're half-assed Iranians. God, it's such a beautiful gesture. Ugh, you are totally having one of those "I'm dating an immigrant" moments. Like, "isn't learning about other cultures so fun and enriching? I feel like I'm--" Hi. Hi. So, this is where you've been? Yeah. We just came out here. Where were you? Your father got lost. I took the scenic route. That's not funny. This is Maxine, my friend. Maxine, meet my parents. Hi. Hi, Maxine. Oh. Hi. So, how do you like Noruz? I'm so sorry. I think I left my purse inside. I got to go run and get it. I will see you really soon. Nice to meet you both. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. It says on your profile that you're an artist. Yeah, I do a stand-up/folk music hybrid act. I have never heard of that. Yeah, my art defies labels. Sounds like it. Why does comedy always have to be so mean and at somebody's expense? I want to use my comedy to bring attention to social-justice issues. You're very pretty. Thank you. Why don't you get to work on that drink? Can I get a glass of water? Come here. Closer. You have really nice hair. Thanks. You can be rough with me. Tell me what you want me to do. Lie on the bed. Okay. Fuck! Could you put these on? What? You're-- you're the one who wanted weed. Well, I reek of sex. It's gonna trigger the drug dealer's brain to call in his rapist brain. You're lucky I veer macho. Thank you. You're amazing. Ladies first. I'm not so good at smoking weed around people. Can't hold my thoughts still long enough to think them. I have to chase them. I know what you mean. The other day, I had a really good idea for a children's book while I was smoking weed, and now I have no idea what it was. Keep smoking. You'll get it back. Have you ever seen that episode of "sex and the City" where Carrie has to pitch a book for children and she pitches this idea about a little girl with magic cigarettes? And it's really funny. I hate "Sex and the City." Yeah, but you have to admit it's pretty fucking entertaining. I think it's boring. Who the fuck do you think you are? Oh, my God, are you into "Lord of the Rings"? You know, the older my dad gets, the more he looks like Gollum from "Lord of the Rings." My dad, he's always making the worst jokes, but then this one time he lost his wedding ring, and he was like... "I need my precious." And was literally the funniest thing I'd ever heard. When I went to see the film "Precious," there was a mentally handicapped guy sitting next to me, and he put his hand on my lap during the movie, and it really freaked me out. That's horrible. Don't make fun of me. This is serious. You're right, it's very serious, and I cannot believe that lifetime has not made the movie version of the time some dude felt you up at the movies. You're such a jerk. You love it. Shirin. Yeah? We're the same kind of stoned person. That is so beautiful. No homo. What do you mean, "no homo"? Oh, you don't know what "no homo" is? Okay, so "no homo" is this thing that rappers say to each other to, like, nullify the gayness of their words. They could be like, "those are some really fly jeans, man. No homo." Or "your song touched me. No homo." Like "I like the way your dick tastes in my mouth. No homo." Exactly. I feel really lucky to have met you. No homo? Homo. I love how none of your white shirts get those really annoying pit stains that mine always do. I love that you noticed that. I have something on my mind, but it feels too scary to say out loud. Say it. Do you have anything on your mind? Maybe. What? Don't be a pussy. Okay, let's say it at the same time on the count of three. One... Two... Two... I'm falling in love with you. I'm thinking of transitioning into a man. Of course I'm falling in love with you. Hi, everyone. I'd like to welcome you all to "with justice for some," where we look at the criminal justice system and its bias against the queer community. Now if any of you are here for the dyke knitting circle, it's been moved to Babeland on Rivington. Um, we have some copies of the case study to go around, so please take one if you don't have it already. What are you doing here? Oh, hey. You're not the only one who cares about gay rights. This is my event. I marked it on the calendar. Hey, guys, let's hold the side talk until after the discussion. Sorry. Why don't we start by introducing ourselves, hmm? I am Sasha, and I am a law Professor at NYU. Hi, I'm Morgan. I'm an intern at queer aid. Maxine. What? Is that shirt new? Yes. It looks really good on you. I'm Joseph Henderson, and I'm extremely disappointed with the reading material you've provided. Absolutely no reference to crime against nature laws. It's weird seeing you in something I don't remember. True, um, this reading doesn't refer to-- I was arrested at 18 for having consensual sex with my 16-year-old boyfriend. I spent four years in jail, and afterwards forced to register is a sex offender. What are you doing later? Going home. Remember when that was my home, too? Please don't do this. I'm a sex offender. Every town I move to, every job I apply for-- My life is ruined. Have a drink with me later? No. I just want to talk. No! ...And I thought we were going to be talking about marginalized women here today. Yes. My name is Shirin. I am an Iranian bisexual teacher, and I would like to take you out for a drink. N-- Now? Right after this. I would like to buy you a drink. Um... Each frame is a picture. That's what you call it, a frame. And, uh, when you want to have the candy move, you're gonna take a picture of it where it is, move it very, very slightly, and then to the next place, and then you take a picture and you have it there, and then move it a little bit-- He took it! Do not eat those. Those are for the stop-motion animation. Just one. You just shoved like 40 into your mouth at once. I get 40, too. Me, too! I need to go to the bathroom. Me, too! Are you old enough to go on your own? I don't know. All right, wait here. All right, first shot of the day. We have the flocks of birds swarm into frame, evil-looking ravens and gulls. How's that looking, art department? Excellent. And sound? Is everything set? Hi. Sorry to interrupt. Not a problem. We were just prepping for today's shoot. Gracie, would you mind, uh, briefing our guest on today's project? We're doing a shot-for-shot remake of a scene from "The Birds." I'm Shirin. I teach across the hall. Hi, I'm Tibet. This is the advanced class. I have a real quick question for you. Yes? So, yeah, my kids are real young, like five years old, and one of them needs to use the bathroom. Yes? Well, do I have to go in with him, or is that pervy? Are you serious? Yes. Just stand behind the door and ask if he needs help. Oh. Okay, thanks. Not a problem, my friend. Have we met before? I don't think so. I used to be a hair model, so you might recognize me from that. Yeah, that's probably it. Thank you. All right, second shot of the day. We have, "she is trapped in the phone booth and the birds are flying in to attack her." Hair and makeup for that, how are you doing? Thank you so much for coming all the way out to Brooklyn. It is so nice that you finally got to see the place. Well, the rug looks quite nice in here. Thank you. Why is there only one bed? It's European and thrifty. There's a lot of benefits. And how-- How's that European? I have an Italian friend named Cecilia, and she her best friend, uh, shared one bed for years, and they saved so much money on rent that they were able to afford very big weddings to their boyfriends. Do you have a boyfriend, Maxine? No, I don't. Also, in the movie "Beaches," these two best friends shared a bed, and it was very inexpensive. So, thank you so much for coming. Nice to see you both again. Well, bye, girls. Bye. Let me walk you out. Oh, my God. You... You're an angel. You have to tell them about us. I know. Yes? Hi. Hey. Crystal, did you see my parents? Oh, yeah, we just passed in the hall. Hey, Maxine. Hi. Mmm, don't mind her. She's upset 'cause I'm not out to my parents. Oh, well, you guys live in a one-bedroom apartment. I'm pretty sure they know. Don't ask, don't tell. You know what? It's a process, and I'm working on it. Okay, we should probably leave. Think I'm gonna bow out. Maxine, you promised you'd go. Crystal's a friend who's gonna dress up like a farm animal and touch herself, come. I can't handle an art show right now. Okay. I love you. Bye. Bye. Bye, Maxine. Bye. Thank you so much for accepting my invitation. Well, I couldn't have refused even if I wanted to. All those people. You're right. I will invite them all to our wedding. Um, what are you drinking? It's kind of like an old fashioned. Want to try it? Yeah. You know, I can um, tie a cherry stem into a knot with my tongue. Real-- Um... Yeah, that's a good look. Thank you. I feel very sexy. I'm surprised by how quickly they sprung into action. It's almost as if they expected me to make a huge mess. Oh, it sounds like you have a conspiracy on your hands. Yes, I do. This is not a case of me being a clumsy oaf. I am a victim of a larger force. The bar and alcohol industry. Yes. Out to get you. Yes, 'cause they need a girl like me to, you know, humiliate herself, so that the other patrons can feel more confident. Yeah, 'cause they get to go home with a drink and a show. Yeah. Okay. Are you horrified? Is this like the most embarrassing thing you've ever witnessed? I don't embarrass easily. I like that. It's getting late. Yeah. Do you want to see my place? I live with this woman who may or may not be practicing witchcraft. I'd love to introduce you. Can I take a rain check? Yeah, sure, of course. Um... get the check, please? This is on me, literally and metaphorically. No, don't worry about it. No, I said I got it. I got-- I got this one. Thank you. No, I've-- Look, I got it. I said I got it. I'm not taking this back. I invited you out. Okay. What train you taking home? Actually, I'm gonna stay and use the bathroom. You should just go. No, I'll wait. No, it's okay. Just go. You are stubborn. Yeah. Thanks for coming out with me. Well, thank you for asking me. Okay, bye. Bye. Hi. Um, can I have the cheapest red you've got? Thank you. Can I ask what you're having? The cheapest red they had. How is it? Alcoholic. With an oaky finish. Sounds good. Sorry, I'm not well-versed in wine talk. "Oaky finish" was a nice touch. Thanks. I'm Ted. Shirin. Shirin. Hi. Hi. Um, do you live around here? Hi. Oh, hey, who's your friend? This is Shirin. Shirin, I'm Marie. Hi. Yeah, we uh, live a few blocks from here, actually. Mm-hm. Cool. Hey, do you want to come sit with us? Okay. I'm like one bad romantic encounter away from moving to France and changing my identity. Hmm. Do you want an olive? No, I'm okay. But maybe I should go to, like, a less glamorous place, like Slovenia or something, where my chances of popularity would be greater. Hmm. They're really good. I'm okay. Would you like some wine? Yeah. Why are you giggling? I'm just-- I've been plotting on how to get you eat one of these olives, because they're covered in garlic, and we've already had some. Oh. I guess it's sort of an all or nothing kind of thing. Problem solved. You should show her your latex outfit. You have a latex outfit? Yeah. Yeah, I have to oil up to put it on. Wow. Yeah, please put that on. Oh. Thanks. Drink? Yeah. Um, so in what situation does a person find themselves in need of latex outfit? Burlesque shows, play parties, all kinds of places, really. Ah. Um, okay, but-- But here's my question. Why do the women have to dress up like slutty cupcakes? What about the dudes? Well, I have a latex outfit, too. That's sounds horrible. Oh, it's really cute. I'll have to take your word on that one. Thanks. Cheers. Cheers. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm sorry, I-- I just got a little in my head for a minute. No, it's-- it's okay. It's okay. So this is my first time doing this. Well, we can take it slow. Thank you. I like you. A lot. Thank you. I like you, too. You know what? We don't have to fuck. You know, we can just hang out, play monopoly or something. That actually sounds like a lot of fun. Great. I have the clue version. Oh. Yeah. That's really cool. Yeah. It's awesome. Honey. You two can stay as you are. Um, I should get dressed. No, don't. It's okay. Um, I sh-- I should go. No, no. Ted, Ted, tell her to stay. Thanks. I really don't want this to be the last time that we see each other. Me, neither. How come no one said you had to come dressed as one of your favorite characters from "The Little Rascals"? That's the great thing about pride. People here look like they didn't go to college. Your attitude is really pissing me off. Sorry. Did you see the drag queen? That's my friend. How come the only aspect of gay culture that's okay with you is drag? Hey, what am I good at? I don't know, what? Drinking and dancing, remember? Let's have fun. Fine. Kiss me. Two vodka red bulls, please. Thank you. Thanks. Aah. Can I get another one? You havin' fun? Sure. Look, before you ask, no, I'm not an f to m transsexual. Uh, sorry to disappoint. What are you doing here? My sister and I made a bet. I'm guessing she won? Ah... correct. I'm Maxine. George. Nice to meet you. I can see you. Shirin, stop. Fuck you. I'm sorry. I don't know what happened. What the fuck? He's a man. It was like kissing a baby. What? It's just like lips touching. I hate you so much when you're drinking. I'm so-- Do not touch me. Whoa. Are you okay? You shoved me off, like, really violently. You cheated on me. You hit me. I feel sick. Please don't cry. Don't. I'm sorry. You have to forgive me. Who is he? Just some guy at the bar. We were just drinking. And you were like, "want to kiss a lesbian?" It only lasted a second. I was watching you. It was forever. Hey. I am sorry. You have to forgive me. Who spends $300 on a garter belt? May I help you? Uh, we're just looking. Actually, yes. Um, I'm looking for the grown-up underwear of a woman in charge of her sexuality and not afraid of change. I've got that. This just came in from France. It's a bit pink. Well, why don't you try it on for yourself? Let me know what you need, and I'll get a room ready for you. I actually need to stock up on panties. My ex-girlfriend uh, cut up most of mine, so I'm gonna need more. What about bras? I don't wear those. Why not? Just don't have that much to work with, so it feels a little silly. You know, like when little girls carry purses. What's your name? Shirin. Shirin. You are a woman, and you have breasts, and there's nothing wrong with them. Yeah, I know. You deserve a sexy, supportive bra, just like any other woman. Okay. You were with a woman for how long, and she didn't help you find the right bra? A while. Well, it sounds like your ex-- What's her name? Maxine. Sounds like Maxine was destructive to your panties and your self-esteem. I'm so sorry. Is this really necessary? I'm fine. I ju-- I just need underwear. Just because your breasts are small doesn't mean they're not legitimate. I know. It's okay to be angry. Oh, my God. Let's try that on. You know, it's like I didn't think I deserved a bra, because I don't see myself as a real woman. It's about more than just fabric. Yeah, and I've been wearing bikini bottoms for months. Well, that's basically inviting people who don't respect you into your bedroom. That's exactly what I did, and now I'm like seeing her at a party on Saturday, and how do I expect anyone to take me seriously if I am not wearing a bra? I take you seriously. That doesn't count. Stunning. God, I hate your friends. My friends are my family. You don't know what that's like, to have to choose your own family because the one you were born into-- Oh, come on, enough of this lesbian orphan propaganda. You know, we're all born into shit families. We deal with it. What is your problem? My problem is I haven't been fucked in like three weeks. I am not gonna talk about this on my birthday. On your birthday? What are you, eight? So you happened to be born. Big fucking deal. Oh, I'm sorry, all attention must revolve around you 100% of the time. I forgot. No, that's not true. I'm not like that. I don't know why I get so shocked when you do shit like this. You're a grown woman in a creepy, co-dependent relationship with your parents. It's totally normal, and you have no idea what you're talking about because you completely abandoned your family. It wasn't a choice! Of course, it's a choice! Says the closet case! They know I know they know. I'm waiting for the right time to bring it up, out of respect for them. I think you and I see the world totally differently. We do. You know, you think that I'm a bad person because I'm not coming out on your terms, and I don't agree with that. That is not true. I didn't say that. That's totally true. You're not listening to me. I'm listening to you, and everything you're saying is pissing me off and completely inaccurate. You are ruining my birthday. You're ruining my twenties. I can't-- I don't have the patience to deal with you. That's fine. Let's break up. Fine. Okay. If you're gonna go, just go. You don't get to take things. I got you those panties. Absolutely not. Fuck you. What the fuck is wrong with you? I got these for you. You're a fucking crazy person! You want to play like this? Do you want to do this? Okay. I bought all the booze for this party. Are you happy? Is this what you wanted? You know what-- don't bother telling your parents about us. I know you, and the more that I think about it, this is probably just a phase. God, this was such a waste. Hey. Hi. Nice hair. Thanks. This is Jon Francis. This is Maxine. Jon, show her your chest tattoo. It took them four hours to do it. It's a giant squid biting a sperm whale. Cool. How are you? I'm okay. You? Good. You should meet my date. Where is she? At the bar, getting us drinks. Great. She sounds awesome. She is. God, look how things worked out for both of us. You have your lady who fetches you drinks at a bar, like a maid, and I have my hunky rebel with a cause. Oh, what's the cause? Jon's spearheading a campaign to bridge the gaps of gentrification in Brooklyn through mass Kombucha brewing. That's not a thing. Yeah, we're gonna go dance now. Jon's known all over Bushwick for his vogueing. What a coincidence. T's an amazing dancer. Oh, is she? Yeah. She goes to her west African dance class religiously. Is she black? No. She sounds awesome. She is. Tibet? Hey, Shirin. This is your date? You two know each other? Yeah, we work together. Tibet, this is Jon Francis. Jon, show her your chest tattoo. Uh, Tibet's a former hair model. Yeah, I heard. Maxine and I used to date. Can you imagine? Nope. Why not? I thought you were straight. Fuck you. Whoa, that is uncalled for! Your hair is uncalled for. Baby, let's go get high. I don't want to get high. Whatever. What is up with your passive disinterest in everything? Seriously, what happened at Wesleyan that did this to you? Maxine, maybe we should go. Oh, shut up, Tibet. No one cares what you have to say. You have the sex appeal of a ferret. I'm in here. It's Maxine. Go away. The door was unlocked. I don't know how you could try to replace me with that fetus. I'm not trying to replace you. I hate Jon. I know. Take a cab home. You're gonna be okay. All right, okay, everybody please come sit. I have a film. Everybody stop playing and come watch the movie. Alright, so this is one of the first films that was ever made for audi-- It's not appropriate for our age. Why do you have to be like that? What are you looking at? Kujo, Groucho, why are you not sitting here? I'm screening a film. We're watching a movie. Yes! No, I want you right here. What happened? Okay... Do we gotta clean all that up? There's too much. Hey, guys. Leave it. Just leave it. New plan. I say forget the stop motion. What movie do you guys want to make? I want to make a movie about farts. Alright, great. Let's do it. Farts. Zombies! Zombies? Awesome. Boogers! What else have we got? It's a good start. What else do we have here? I want boogers in my movie. Boogers. There we go. Butts. Butts. You guys are in the zone. Keep it flowing. Naked ninjas! I'm not a zombie. I'm just a boy. But you're making the zombie mask. It doesn't matter if it's your character. You're just making it up. Can it have more eyes than two? Yes. Zombies have as many eyes as you want them to have. Welcome to the "Brooklyn Kidz Moovie Maker, final screening." First we screen the advanced class, and the non-advanced class. Thank you for coming. I wrote that speech. I love farting. I can't fart. Oh, you guys. They're beautiful. Thank you so much. You're welcome. You guys are the best. Thank you. Thank you. Shirin. Hi, Ken. So, that was... Disgusting. I'm so sorry. Actually, I thought it was hilarious. Seriously? Yeah. I was crackin' up. Thank you so much for saying that. Yeah. Let's face it, farts are funny. I agree. Farts are funny. Thank you. Have you seen Carrington? Hey, what are you doing here? Hiding. I'm sorry I've been such a dick about Layli. Aw, come on, forget it. Come on, let's go inside. My old roommate Maxine and I were in a relationship. Ah, so you're a lesbian. I was pretty into all the guys I was with, so I think I'm bisexual. And that's a thing? I'm afraid so. All right. How do you think mom and dad are gonna take it? Oh, you're not gonna tell them now that it's over. Seems like a pretty big thing to not be honest about. Fine. Just uh, wait until after the wedding, alright? You are such a dick. Well, at least I'm not a sexually confused narcissist. Can we please go inside? Hey, can I be your best man? No, absolutely not. I ate before I came. Ow, fuck! Ow! Shit. I'm sorry I ruined your scarf. Mom, I'm a little bit gay. Yes, I am. And I was in love with Maxine. Shh. Shirin, are you okay? I'm okay. Stop breathing so loud. Okay. Has your mom mentioned it? No. Maybe she didn't understand what you meant. No, she knows for sure what's up. I'm gonna bring it up in about a month. I'm proud of you. Thanks. There's a party at the loft on Saturday. You should bring that waiter, Brendan. Um, I would, but I kinda want to see if Jacques and Felicia try to seduce me. It's never gonna happen. I don't know why you think they're swingers. I just get that vibe. You should invite that gay lawyer. Did you guys touch tongues? No, we didn't, and it actually hurt my feelings. No, you know, there are people in this world who go on first dates that are perfectly great, and then they wait a while before they engage in sexual contact. That's disgusting. I know, I think it all happens outside of New York. Maybe you're right. When he texts me, it's like he only texts me using emoticons. Why can't you use your words? Do you know what I mean? I think that he thinks that that is like cute. I and like...
