Our race was saved by the attainment of Kolinahr. Kolinahr: through which all emotion is finally shed. You have labored long, Spock... Now receive from us this symbol of total logic. Your thoughts... give them to me. Our minds, Spock... ...one and together. This consciousness calling to you from space... It touches your human blood, Spock. You have not achieved Kolinahr. His answer lies elsewhere. He will not achieve his goal with us. Live long and prosper, Spock.
