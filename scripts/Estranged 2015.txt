Hello, Mum! -My God. -Whoo! Faster! I love you! I love you too! Whoo! Go faster! Whoo! Faster, Callum! January! Is she going to be okay? Is she going to be all right? Hey. Hey. Hey, Jan. Hey. Stay with me babe, okay? Jan. Someone talk to me! Is she going to be okay? Jan... Mum! Mummy! They're coming! Is this your house? Is this where you grew up? I can't remember. God, you should see my Mum's place. It's a right shit hole. Fuck. Ms. Dunfield, I'm Thomas. Your butler? The family are very excited to see you. You have a butler? -Welcome. -Surprise! January? Your hair looks nice. You told them, didn't you? No one told us about this. You still look beautiful to me. I've missed you so much. Mum. Mum. You can't remember anything before the accident? Nothing. Will it come back? I really don't know. -Did the doctors check you for clots? -Yeah. -Hemorrhages? -Yes. Laurence, stop interrogating her. I'm just checking there's nothing else the matter. She couldn't come back if there were. You trust a Mexican doctor? It's a Brazilian. Rio's in Brazil, not Mexico. I did Geography. Can hold my breath for three minutes. Did you, um, make the banner? It... it's good. It's nothing really. How long was I away for? -Six years. -Six. How did you crash the scooter? -Dad. -Shush, Katherine. I'm curious myself. Were you speeding? Then you could have slowed down. I was there too. It's just as much my fault. One of you can still walk. You should keep your mouth shut. Callum. Hey, hey, come on. So what do I need around here? Wellies? Boots? Cloth cap? Whippet? Jan? Jan? When she hugged me, nothing came back. I didn't ask for this. Well, where else could we have gone? I'm only here because I'm sick. They must think I'm so fucking selfish. No, they don't. Didn't I ever tell you why I left? Well, you wouldn't talk about it. What if I never remember? Well, when you first woke up, you thought I was there to change the bedpans. But you remember me now, don't you? You felt right. So will they. Eventually. Come on. Let's take your drugs. Yeah? I have prepared the guest room for you, sir. It's across in the east wing. No, I'm all right here. Thanks. Only married couples can share beds, sir. House rules, I'm afraid. What century is this? I'll be outside. Now I feel like Mister fucking Darcy. I love you. See you in the morning. I think I prefer the other part of the house. Bet you can play some wicked games of hide-and-seek here though. The family have never been ones for games, sir. How do you know? Well, I've lived here all my life. My father was the butler before me. Can I ask you a question? Of course. Was January happy here? I think so. I'm trying to understand why she left. I just want to help her, that's all. I'm just a butler, sir. Your room. What the fuck? You... ever shot anything before? You want to? My arms are fine. I forgot. You always liked doing things your own way. You can do my makeup for me. Really? Just don't make me look like a slut. Bloody hell! Never mind. Have another go. The recoil takes a bit of getting used to. It's only the gangs back home that have guns. Well, you need them here. Hunting, putting things down, that sort of thing. That's the way it is. I suppose it's... I suppose it's more of a tool than a weapon out here. No, it's a weapon all right. That's the worst mistake you can make, to forget that. We're miles away from the police here. What if somebody broke in? It's always a weapon. There you go. Whoa. Did I get it? How much would it cost... for you to go to London... and not come back? You don't have a job... don't have anywhere to live... If you can't look after yourself... how are you gonna look after her? I'm staying with her. And you can't change that. And besides... I've got the gun. It's not loaded. We... We'll have more luck over the hill. Just be careful going up. It's slippy. Callum's nice, isn't he? He's all right. Do you have a boyfriend? No. All the boys around here look like Dad. You should go to the city. Meet someone who isn't covered in mud. I couldn't do that. Nothing's stopping you. I'm settled here. You'll settle for this? Yes. This is our home. This is how we live. We can't all run away when we feel like it. Some of us have responsibility. You're too skinny. You need to put on some weight. I couldn't eat solids for a month. We'll have you plumped up in no time. So, what do you think? I'm so glad you're home. When did you stop liking beans? I'm fine. -Come on. Just a little cup. -No thanks. Please? For me? Will you stop mollycoddling her? Don't you have a job to go to? It's my day of rest. Animals don't get sick on Sunday? It's the Lord's day. He's got them covered. Play nice, you two. I'm not playing anything. She can't mind her own business. Only because I care. You just have nothing better to do. -Yes, I do. -Like what? Get married? Have babies? -Laurence... -Why don't you all just shut the fuck up?! Don't speak in front of Mum like that. Apologize. Hang these. Apologize. Hey, I actually shot one! Hey. Wow. What you been doing? Face painting? What are they, dear? Morphine. Can I have one? You have your own medicine. Who painted that? Katherine did. She did it for me from an old photograph. You were away so long and you never called. Was I really that bad? You had your moments. What the fuck are you doing? She's having a hard time. Hard times aren't exclusive. Everybody has them. Not everybody disowns their family though. Dude, she can't remember. Dude, I remember. She's always thought she's too good for us. I don't believe that. She's always been difficult. Nothing's changed. She's looking for attention. Yeah, she can be hard work, but crippling herself is a bit much. No, you crippled her. But I think she's making the most of it. That's sick. You don't know what she's really like, do you? Hey, guess what this is? It's a ladder. No? Jan? It's nothing. Are you sick? What is it? When did I stop liking beans? Beans? Way to kill the mood, babe. -Seriously. -What? Seriously? Did I ever like them? No. Something doesn't feel right. Yeah, that just might be the amnesia messing with you. It doesn't explain why I left. It probably could have been an age thing, you know? You might have been difficult. What do you mean? No, don't... don't... Don't worry about it. You think I did something? No, no. I'm just saying that that some families don't always get on. It doesn't mean that you... Babe, you're be... You're being paranoid. Fine. I'm crazy. People do just go crazy for no reason. Well, the brain damage might have something to do with that, yeah. So I'm making it up now. It's all my fault. No, I didn't say that. Look, you... You just need time to adjust. This is all new to you. This has been hard for me too, you know. Hard for you? I'm the one who can hardly fucking walk. I'm the one who can't remember anything. Yeah, and I'm the one who sat by your bedside for four months. Do you know how much shit I've got to deal with? Do you know how much shit I've had to deal with since you crashed the scooter? Fuck you. Shit! I'll find a way. Thomas? Is that you? Yes, sir. Get in here. Callum? Callum? Callum? Callum? Where is he? Who? What did you say to him? I asked him to leave. He did. He wouldn't. I beg to differ. Callum's not like that. I made him an offer. He took it. He obviously didn't love you as much as you thought. Boys can be so mean. I need to call him. Phone's dead. We didn't pay the bill. One of you must have a mobile. What for? This is bullshit. You're liars! Every... That's enough! You don't talk to anyone like that. Not at my table. But I... -You come back here after all these years, we allow your worthless boyfriend... -Don't call him that. -You should be ashamed of yourself. I am tired of you behaving like an outsider. You should never have left. It's changed you. You're not the same girl. You're... you're not our Jan. Your sister was doing your washing the other day. She came across a T-shirt. You know what it said? "Queen slut." Do you know what a slut is? Why advertise yourself as one? From now on, we are going back to the old ways. The way it was before you left. From now on, you will dress as a proper girl. Is that understood? That boy was no good for you. You need time to heal. We are your family. You don't need anyone else. Don't you look pretty. Jan, we were wondering... We all do chores around here... Thomas, bless him, he can't do everything, so we all pitch in. I know you weren't very well, but you can help out now. It'll make you feel like you're part of the family. Might make you feel closer to Mum. Thomas. Come here. Here. Here. What are you doing? Pick it up. Oops-a-daisy. Probably best if you don't stand up. Careful. Careful. God, I'm so jealous of you. I'd love a wheely chair. Can you do tricks yet? If I had a broken leg or something and had one of these, first thing I'd be doing is bunny hops up and down the corridor. When my head stops spinning, I'll give it a go. That bump on the noggin really fucked you up, didn't it? Do you still smoke? Yeah. Laurence? Yeah? Why aren't you and Katherine married? 'Cause we're brother and sister? You know what I mean. Well, to be honest... I don't know. It's not like I'm a virgin or anything. I'm not ugly, am I? You're not ugly. There was a girl. But I tried to make it work. But it didn't happen. How about Katherine? Some birds just don't leave the nest. You're definitely not a virgin. How many? I'm not telling you that. Is it over 20? I can't remember. -I'll tell you how many I've had. -I don't care. Six. I've had six. How many? I'm not saying. -Come on. You can tell me. -No, I can't. -I'm your bro. -Are you? You don't think so? Well, you know how we can prove it? How? Suck my cock. It's not incest if you don't think we're related. And you did just say I'm not ugly. Is this a joke? You tell me. God, you really are sick, aren't you? When you were away, I never stopped thinking about you. I've never been out of the county. You've been all over the world. I used to lie in bed when I couldn't sleep and imagine what you were doing. What you were seeing at that very moment. You saw some beautiful things, didn't you? Tell me about the places. I can't. I have flashes. I can see things... but it doesn't make sense. I can... see beaches... and forests... but there's nothing personal to it. It's... just air. What a shame. Such a waste of a life. Good night. -Mum? -Yes? Will you stay with me for a bit? It's pretty chilly. Best if you stay here. What's that for? -See that field? -Yeah? In it, there's a large bull whose testicles I need to examine. And I'm going to make sure it's bloody unconscious before I do so. Back in a jiffy. Put the radio on if you like. I'm okay. He thinks he's a vet. Come back. Come back to me now. You are doing so well. Good. That's it. You could be a ballet dancer. I'm so proud of you. -Mum? -Yes? What's my favorite color? I thought you ladies might like some refreshment. That's so sweet of you, Thomas. Thank you. Okay. Where's the nearest phone? It's in the village. Can you take me to it? With your father's permission, yes. I don't need his permission. Look, your father is very protective of you in this state. I need to ring Callum. I don't think it's wise to be having this conversation here, Miss. All you have to do is take me there. I can look after myself. Your family love you very much. You shouldn't disappoint them. Now, is there anything else? Jan? January? Jan? Jan, are you in there? I'm getting changed. -Do you need a hand? -No, I'm fine. Are you fucking deaf? Go away! I was only trying to help. You don't have to be a bitch about it. Jan, it's time for breakfast. I'm sorry about calling you a bitch. I didn't mean it. We can go out today if you want. Go to the village. Do some shopping. Jan, this is silly. Fine. Have it your way. January? I'm warning you. Open this door at once. Albert, you're scaring her. Shut up. I swear to God, I will kick this door down if you don't open the door this minute! Daddy... Albert, stop it. Stop it. January, open this door! January... I'm angry with you, darling. Take all the time you want. I love you. January? I'd really like to hear your voice. January, open this door! Door! Door! Door! In the room. You're being very stupid right now. Keys. Get in! How far do you think you're going to get? Come on! In. Close the door. You see what you've done? I should have fucking killed her. You can't. She's mine. She held a knife to your throat. She's not well. You're in so much trouble. January, we're trying to understand your situation. It's very hard for all of us. You're not my dad. He's not my brother. And she is definitely not my fucking sister. Dad! You know you're not right in the head, don't you? I have proof. Proof? I'd like to see that. I think we all would. It's in my pocket. Where did you get this? I won't ask you again. -You! -Albert! It wasn't him. Albert! If it wasn't for your mother, you'd have been dead the minute you walked through the door. My mum killed herself. I know. We were here. Who are you? People you thought didn't matter. Our lives weren't perfect, but we coped until your bastard father came along and changed everything. What did you do to my dad? I made it right. And Callum? Worthless. Just like your dad. One way or another... you're going to be part of this family. Never! Yes. Never. Please! Please don't let him do this. Please don't. Please, please, please! Please. Katherine, please listen. Mum, help me. Please. It's for the best. Just be brave. Please! Please... Please! Please! No! Stop! Please don't! Clean yourself up. He might not show it, but Daddy really does care for you. I don't have to be nice to you. Don't believe me? Dig Callum up and see what I did to him. Now let's try that again. When Katherine was a young girl, I gave her a rabbit. Every day she fed it, played with it. But one winter, it got so cold, all the animals died. We had nothing to eat. So, Father took the rabbit and broke its neck. He had to... so that he could feed us. Katherine cried for weeks. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made. Sometimes you have to do... horrid things to protect the ones you love. There's no point hiding. Come on, girl. You know it's no use. No! No! No! Just one more. You need your strength. Eat. There's two of you now. Good girl. Good girl. A pregnant girl shouldn't be living in a basement. You're really upsetting Mummy. A real mum wouldn't let this happen. We're only taking what's ours. You think this'll make all this yours? It's still my house. No, it's our house. We've had it for ages. No one cares. You know, the villagers don't know that your daddy's dead. To be honest, they wouldn't give a hoot even if they did. He wasn't... gregarious. Do you know what that means? It doesn't have to be like this. You can have your old room back. Be part of a real family. All you have to do is ask. Open the door. Night night. It's a really good way of expressing yourself. Just paint what you feel. Close them. You were always the favorite, even though you were never there. Mum always said you were special. It was an accident. I slipped. I'm sorry. Can I live upstairs again? I promise I'll be good. How did you sleep? Better. We have a surprise for you. Wait till you see this. You're going to love it. It's absolutely beautiful. That's it. Now then, come on. There we are. Here she comes. Here we are. There. And... surprise! Father and Laurence spent all night fixing it. It was yours when you were a baby. What do you say? Thank you. I haven't seen you smile for so long. They told me... that they would kill you if I said anything. See, they were just the staff. They tended the land, they cooked, they cleaned, and this is their revenge. To make you suffer... and to make me serve. What did my dad do? Thomas, drinks. Sweet dreams. -I'm cold... -I knew you couldn't be trusted. You stupid child. Gonna learn? Get up! Will you take this to January? I do love you. Mum made you some milk. January? Why do you think I'm special? Because of this? Just calm down. I don't want my baby to live. Not here. Not with you. Please. Put it down. What'll you do? Shoot me? You're insane. And whose fault is that? I want to leave. I want to leave right now. Why? No one else wants you. Why else am I special? Is it because Daddy never wanted to fuck you? Stop it. And he never will. He'll never love you like he loves me, and neither will Mum. You'll always come second best. Go on. Do it. Kill me. This is not just about you! I won't tell Daddy about this. It'll be our secret. For years, they watched your father's decline, waiting for their chance. And when Callum called about the accident, they took their revenge. See, your father,he forced himself on one of the coal workers. He got her pregnant. Then, when the baby was born, he took it off her and he raised it as his own. And the woman you thought was your mother, she couldn't live with the guilt. All of the staff knew. We just had to watch you grow up and keep everything a secret. And your real mother, she knew everything, so she told you, and that's why you ran away. Who is she? Who's my mum? You already know the truth. We have to go. We have to go now. Please. Please, Miss. Give me the gun. Go on. January, hello. You need to calm down and think about this. I'd never hurt you. I love you... my little sister. So I guess that blow job's out the window. What the fuck is going on? Not in my fucking house! You fucking bitch! Mum. I'm so sorry. I'm going to miss you.
