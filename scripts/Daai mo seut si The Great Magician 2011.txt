But our hard days will soon be over. General Bully Lei loves his soldiers. If you're willing to join Lei's Army. I, Liu Kun-shan, the Chief of Staff promise you... Food, money and fortune! What's that? Buns! Silver! They've gone crazy. Liu Kun-shan. You trick these farmers with magic! Captain Tsai how dare you slander your superior? I'm just speaking the truth. Covert military recruitment is illegal. Put a curse on me if you dare. Execution! Do you know what this is? This is the world's most notorious weapon... Invented during the Ching dynasty. Can behead enemies from miles away... Flying guillotine. It's the flying guillotine! Captain Tsai I'll kill you with this legendary device. Lei's Army value discipline. Will you join us? I will! Me too! Good, Butler Liu. You've recruited 5,000 soldiers in 3 months. You're a genius. General I just used a few tricks. It's your great name that convinced the farmers. By all means necessary when it comes to recruiting. However. Don't let me be a superstition monger. Yes, sir. We've 5,000 more soldiers to feed. Just food alone will cost a lot. Where do I find money to buy guns? General, make up your mind now. All the warlords are fighting. If we don't gather enough forces... We'll be overrun soon I never cared about money. But now I can't do anything without it. Let's ask those merchants for more I've celebrated my lunar, solar birthdays and my wedding anniversaries with my wives. What can I use this time? Sir. There's a general who taxes the farmers. On their livestock. Should we try it? Should I pay tax for you in the name of... dogs"? I'm just teasing you! If we tax the poor we'll be "dogs". General. The ceremony is about to begin. Master... Master. Today's party is a grand solemn event. Behave yourself while you're out there. What a group of noisy women. Stand back, all of you! Move. Honey. You look really handsome heroic in this uniform. It's very impressive! Good. Stand behind me too I refuse! I, your 3rd wife, want to show off that I'm your favorite! Where's Madam 7th? Forget about her. She's being rude as usual! Applause, for the General Daisy and Peach, how are you? Aren't Apricot and Melon Seed here? Ladies and gentlemen I'm pleased to announce. "Taga Culture Group" and General Lei have cofounded... "Kanwa Films." Starting today! It's a collaboration. We'll send a team of advisors... To help General Lei with his venture. Why did he wink at me? He wants you to read inside his words. He's not talking about movies but... Military support. Why Play on words? It's called "diplomacy". What is this thing? A projector I prepared a short film today. SO everyone can experience the magic of film! "Double Agent." You've the lead? "Starring: Liu Kun-shan". "Director: Tarou Mitearai." "Urgent, Lei's army is expanding." He used to be my assistant. But I discovered that he actually is a spy. Trying to expose our recruiting activities. What did you do? I used western hypnotism to control him. Bullshit. Really? If you believe it then it's real. Isn't that Daisy and Peach? They're Taga Group's new "action stars". Wonderful! Film is an illusion! It's not real. Don't be fooled! I know, those money are fake too! No, we used real money! I increased the budget for better effects. Filmmaking is expensive. "To be continued." Bravo! Movie reflects life and vice versa. Fascinating! Bravo! One more announcement. Our company will produce a romance film. Please recommend a female lead to us. Let me do it. Pick me! What? The leading role. Why you? Because I'm your woman. Good answer, it's yours. General. You haven't recovered yet. If you're crippled you may never lead troops again. Cursing me? I dare not. Sir, please take it with you. Enough! My 7th wife. It's me, your babe I've not seen you in weeks I miss you! "The Phoenix's Fly" I used last time. Not only didn't work I even sprained my back I'll attack with my "Crossed Fist" this time. Prepare for your... doomsday tonight. Here I come! You... want to kill your husband? We're not married. Ceremony is not important. My love for you is what counts. You're disgusting. Upset for being the last one? I'll get rid of the rest and make you no.1. What a pig face I am a bull, not a pig. Liu Yin I'm feeling horny. My body is telling me... Time to have a baby. Won't you help me, please? It hurts. Catch it. Smells good! Yin, I've come to ask you. What is this thing... "free love"? You took all your women by force, forget it. Don't believe the rumors. My first wife was arranged marriage. Wives 2 to 6 offered themselves to me! You'd to take them all? It'd have been rude to say no. When will you let me go? I must find my father! Forget him. Once you find him, you'll never come back. How will I ever find you again? Rotten warlord! Yin, just stay here. If you're bored I can take you to magic shows. Or you can try to... fall in love with me. Don't come to me until you find my father! Future father-in-law. Once we find you, I can marry her! Where on earth are you? Liu Wan-yao. You made your name by... performing the "7 Wonders" for Her Majesty. But defied an edict to stop the riots with your magic. You think you could escape by changing your name? Stop wasting my time! Where's the scroll? It's gone. You just used it for the last trick I won't give it up. You know what tortures await you? Severed tendons, broken kneecaps amputated fingers... Castration. Devil, your parlor tricks won't work on me. Let's see when I drill your teeth. Everything is an illusion, a dream. When I wake up everything will be fine. Self-hypnosis? I'll play along! Father I'm your daughter Yin. They're hurting me burning me, cutting me... It hurts! Save me I'm sorry, my dear. Father can't help you. Where's the scroll? I'll kill you. Don't force me! You won't until you get the "7 Wonders". The rhythm of my clappers is slow as people rush to and fro. Warlords fight in endless war. Coins don't have value any more. It costs me eight catties... to buy two noodle patties. Grandpa. Don't bother with these affairs. Just sing and. Ply our arts in a fair. This place has so much to give. Come and see. Storytelling, singing, kung fu fighting. Donkey, and picture show. All kind of entertainment. Illusions are sights to behold. Enchanting both young and old. Behind each performer. A trick with flair. Fish bowls, braziers appear out of thin air. Each performer has talent to spare. To name the best would be unfair. Brother, stop worrying. There are many talents around. If only we could find one. Our business will definitely improve. That's easier said than done. "Lucky Wind" Tavern books all the best acts. We won't survive another week at this rate! Attention everyone. Ladies and gentlemen. Come see the show! If you can replicate our "Magic Walnut" trick. We'll give you 50 silver dollars! Now, please welcome Master Chen for a demonstration of this magic! Thank you. Bravo... Everyone, watch closely I figured it out, I can win this challenge. Don't embarrass yourself, stay here! Who wants to try... give it a try! Don't be afraid. May I? Welcome. Come and show me, sir. Hi. Please. Look, there's water in the bowl! A naughty pigeon. Pigeon droppings! He solved your trick. Pay him now! - Pay up! - Quiet! Be reasonable. He hasn't got the walnut yet, right? That's right! Bring back the walnut make him pay! Right? Be patient! The walnuts... are on Master Chen. Impressive. Pay up. Yes... Here you go. Sorry, a reward is unnecessary. In that case... Who are you? Where did you learn it? I'm Chang Hsien self-taught for fun! Bravo! Driver! Bro, go get him! Right, he can save our business! Boss, why don't we hire him? Wait, Mr. Chang! I've a favor to ask! What's wrong with you. Mr. Chang. Master Chang! Ignore that man. A ghost! A ghost! I saw a ghost! "Closed for renovation." Good shot with the droppings. Now everyone thinks Chang is a freak. Where is he? I nearly suffocate! Put more air holes in the seat I'll fix it right away. Help yourself to fresh buns. Li Yi. So that couple own "Happy Inn"? Yes. They seem honest enough. "Master scholar and strategist." "Chuke Liang was a genius." "He masterminded military campaigns..." Dear Madams Butler Liu, good day! Where is Madam 7th? She's tired of your shows ages ago. Chen Kuo. Got something new? I'm working on it. Once I'm ready, I'll present it to all of you. Madam 7th isn't interested in anything but the magic show. If she isn't pleased, the General will blame us. Master spoils that vixen! Well said! Master is so bias, isn't he? Definitely! That's enough. Let's not discuss this in public. What did you find out? I sent investigators to Hunan. Only to discover that person is a swindler. The 7 Wonders is a fake. Untrustworthy. But it's historically documented. It's real! Yes... Here's your fee. Take it Butler Liu is warning you. Accomplish this mission or suffer the consequence. It's stolen from a tomb. My dear workers I really had no choice... but to close down our shop. Goodbye. Let's go. Please take care. Bro, if we'd hired Chang that day... we wouldn't be in such dire position! Why am I so unlucky? Mr. Li. Mr. Chang what brings you here? I wish to buy half of your shares. So you can keep this place running. What do you think? My bro is always speechless to important matters. He's overwhelmed by your proposition! But... he has already sold out to Chen Kuo and took his downpayment... Give him back. Will this be enough? Yes! More than enough! I'll ask the staff to return! No need I've men. Go! According to our contract I'm paying back 3 times your deposit. But didn't you say you're quitting? Chang Hsien has returned from overseas. The great magician will perform at "Happy Inn". The great magician?! They've arrived. Have question? What exactly are you planning? You must have an ulterior motive? Stop this! Don't tell me I'm not listening! As long as our family business survives... I don't care. Indeed. You better keep it off. You say Warlord Chang will decimate us but I'm more worried about General Li. General Li's army is larger and closer to us. If he decides to ambush us, we're dead. If Li dares to attack I'll deploy 3,000 elite soldiers... Fight with him! I'll send 8,000 men armed with Mauser pistols! Hei, forget your useless Mauser pistols! I'll dispatch 10,000 troops with He'll be dead! Vickers guns are heavy and dumb! Listen, I've just bought When you fire, it goes bang-bang! Such a blast! Fatso, you left a soldier on my territory. Take it back! This land was mine! You want to take it? Don't put on airs, small officer. Everyone knows you used to smuggle salt. Salt-smuggler! Pull back your troops. Or... I'll show you my force! Just retreat from Master's territory! Why cross Master's over a few acres? Have you no shame? Damn! I thought we're on the same side? Don't yell at me! I can turn my guns on you! One last time... will you retreat? What can you do to me? Refuse...? I'll gouge out your other eyeball! Stop it! What's wrong with you two? Go ahead. Kill each other. Then I can take your territories... without any effort. Do you mean it? Bully Lei isn't a backstabber. If I'd wanted your territories I would've challenged you directly. Because I'm not a sneaky sort! If you've a problem just speak out. What's the point of... fighting amongst us? The public sees us as a bunch of amateurs. If we don't stick together. How will we beat them? You're right, bro Bully. Take a look, brothers! I've tanks to blast my enemies into smithereens! You've got all the latest weapons from Japan. What do we fight them with? Fine. Give me a list of what you need I'll give you what I can. Are you mad, Bully? Why so generous! Did you learn it? He's a man worthy of being our leader. Yes, leader! Hurray! Mitearai san, you really giving him our tanks? Yes. Bully Lei is a fool. Why support him? A fool can be easily manipulated. The Northeastern warlords are too smart. We must hedge out bets. But... Don't worry. I've planted someone. No wonder... Friends and neighbors. To celebrate our re-opening. Today's shows are free! Line up for tickets! Don't push... line up for tickets! Make way! Boss, we're here. This way, please. Your ticket? Didn't you say the show was free? Yes, but you still need a ticket. That's right. Give him two dollars. One will do. Can I go now? Please. This is the legendary "carnival mirror"? I must buy one too. Ladies and gentlemen. Famed for his exploits at Lucky Wind Tavern. Master Chang Hsien! Childish stuff. These are just some cheap tricks from western circuses. You're kidding us! Let's go. Master Chen. Please stay! Yes, Master Chang? Fire is a gift from heavens. Fire can cook. Mankind no longer eat raw meat. It can also refine metal from ore for our use. Since we discovered fire... The fate of mankind has changed. Civilization was born. Could this be the legendary "cold fire"? Fire can keep us warm. But it's also fearful. Do you know what happens when fire falls into the hands... of a magician? I can use it to create spectacles. Or use it to show my fury. Bravo! Te-chun. Let's modify it here. Put that away. Lei's aide has brought his soldiers. Here comes the target. Mr. Chang. How did I perform so far? Very good. Then you'll let me be your assistant? Of course. Good. Let's take a walk. Sure. Tickets are all sold out these few days. We'll be busy. Rest up for the show tomorrow. The general wants to see the show. Block all roads tomorrow. Yes! Rehearsal! Excuse me. What is that? Bully Lei! Can dummy react? Get a real man! Yes... who? You! Fine! Come on! The smoke can only last a minute. Then the guards will realize Lei's disappearance. Go! Will you be this gentle to Lei? You... how could you? Move on! Hurry UP! Go! How long did we take? Over 2 minutes. It's not far off the mark. We're kidnapping Lei. We need to be precise! A single mistake will be fatal. Let's practice again. Bro. Why are you sneaking about? Don't run! Don't run. Don't move! Stay. Everyone... You were just practicing your new act, right? Time for us to come clean. Don't say it! Cover your ears now! Don't worry. They won't intervene. Right. He hasn't said it yet. We haven't heard it yet. Let's just pretend nothing has happened. But you saw everything. Grab them! Stop! Stay. Stop. What do you want? You're endangering all of us. You only care about yourself. You're no better than those scums warlords. We think of the greater good! Greater good... It serves them too! If you're going to hurt them I'll quit. If something goes wrong I'll hold you responsible. Actually I've always wanted to join... whatever to overthrow... whatever. Don't worry. My brother will never betray you! You... sigh! We come for a show or an execution? Shoot you first! Tease me all you can. We're only here to make up the number. She has the master wrapped around her fingers. What else can we do but to amuse ourselves? Right... we've no choice I'm going to fight! A female street-juggler is no match for me! Why are you hiding here? It's the orchestra. What is it? Madam. Bully... help me. Your feet are too big for high heels! Get up now. Excuse me. Sir, the President has summoned a war council I'm not going! But President is a powerful man. We can't upset him. Shut up. - Sit - How can you ignore state affairs? If you skip the meeting, I'm leaving. How I miss your smile I'm leaving ok... One smile for me. Adorable! Go now. Get up now. Change the show. They were a happy couple. What went wrong? The scholar was the girl's lover. The old man is her father. The man with the gun is the bully. While the scholar went aboard the bully kidnapped her. The father went missing, too. The girl lives on in sorrow I feel so sorry for them. Come here. She's crying. Where? Let me see. Wow, real tears! She never forgets her lover, so she cries. Madam. Can I borrow your handkerchief? You don't seem to be moved. Don't you... want them to reunite. Can you make it happen? Magic... aims to create miracles I believed in miracles. But after waiting forever, I'm not so sure. Just have faith. Your dreams... will come true. She's smiling! It's a happy ending! "The back hallway." Return to the mansion. The general just celebrated his birthday so what's the occasion today? Today is his dog's birthday! You mean Butler Liu? It's just another excuse to swindle our money! General, congratulations. Please accept our token of appreciation. General. What is this thing? A bulldog. It's a cross between a bull and a dog. - Such a rarity! - Yeah. Bully. Let's dance! May I? Master I'll step on you. Please. Who are you? Master Chang. You don't want to see me? I've waited 3 years. All I get is a note? I return once I heard what happened. It's been 9 months. These walls can't hold you. Why no escape? He's looking for me. You care about him? If you prefer him just tell me. Don't you trust me? He's not your type of man. That's for me to decide. You have no right to judge me. He's ruthless, evil but kind to me ls Lei truly wicked? Other went abroad vanished without trace even forgot about his wedding. You think... he's a good man? After 3 years we meet again. Yet you said nothing nice to me. Are you sure you still love me? I came back to fulfill my promise I don't think... you're on my guest list. Who are you? Chang Hsien? Bully, the magician, Chang Hsien! Master Chang is here! Come greet him! I love to see your show again tomorrow! Mr. Chang, what brings you here? I invited him. You did? You took me to his show last time I was quite impressed. So I asked him to come for our dog's birthday. You could have told me. You've not given me a chance to speak. Mr. Chang our guests are waiting. So beautiful! What about me? I want one, too! Gorgeous! I'm his first wife! I want something better! Wow. Beautiful. What about me? Master Chang. It's my turn. Do one for me. A magician is nothing without props. General, can I borrow your gun? No. What are you afraid of? Take it. There's 1 bullet left. Very observant. The last bullet... is my gift to you. Hold your fire! Stay. General Lei and his 7th wife are truly a perfect couple. Bully. This is what foreigners call "romantic". Master Chang, shoot at us too! You're really special I must go visit you one day I look forward to it. Stop the tank! Don't touch it! It's hot... Careful... Listen, let's go buy some candy. Go that way. Aide. Which end is the front? General, that end! This end looks better. Next time we drive in reverse. - The general is buying candy! - Yes sir! Hands off! Get the money first! Come. Aide! Sir. Tell me what an aide is responsible for? He needs to pay, sir! You're getting smarter. Yes sir! Yes sir? I'm complementing you. Say "thank you sir". Yes sir! Idiot. Do you want to watch a magic show? Yes! Bully Lei is here! Choose a seat and sit down! There he comes. Get ready to capture him! No. Too many children. You want me to give up this opportunity? He still has my woman I've no interest in your love affairs I'm a man with a cause! You never did anything for yourself or your family? I'm warning you no move until I say so. Hurry up! Buy us some time. Standby. We can't wait! Please sit, general. Fat boy, get lost! General, please... Be nice kid. Take a seat! The show is about to start! General, distinguished guests. Today's show will delight both young and old! Hear that? You're all distinguished guests! Quiet! It's show time! Enjoy! I'm scared... My dear, don't cry. It's fake. Oops, not this! Cover your eyes! Okay to look now. It isn't hot. Do you like it? Ready. His guards are at the back. We can't act without the smoke. Ignore him. Wait for my signal. Don't be nervous. Stop in. Look, fire! I'm scared... Ready? So annoying. It's alright, don't be scared. It's ok hit it! Abracadabra! Trap door. What are you looking for? My friend has disappeared. Disappeared? Did you enjoy my magic? Let's perform together, ok? Get out... Now! A trapdoor and tunnel under the seat. That's how you did the trick. The general is very sharp. If I were sitting there. You could've kidnapped me? That's right! Why didn't I think of that? General is worth a fortune I know who you are... A trickster! That day, with just a few tricks. You kept all people amused. Aren't you a trickster? No, I'm a dream maker. Dream maker? A better word for fraudster. It takes study and practice to deceive. Sir... Stay back. General. Tell me what you want. Teach me a few magic tricks. To make my 7th wife smile I see. But it's quite difficult. Why? Madam 7th seems to be troubled. You can read minds, too? A great magician must be observant I just want to make her smile. It shouldn't be too difficult, right? Tell a friendly lie to make her smile. Know what I mean? Friendly lie? Alright. A simple trick first. See if you can please her. Okay. Pay attention! I've shown you the technique. But I can't guarantee love. It all depends on you I'll make it work! General. Where's she? There. Yin, I come in peace. Please enjoy my show. A cigarette. Turn around. The other way I saw this trick when I was a baby I'm not done. Who taught you this? Who else but Master Chang? He's quite charming. What did you talk about? Nothing much... I told him he kept the ladies amused with just a few tricks. So he must be a trickster. He denied it I said, you're still a fraudster. He said it takes study and practice to deceive. And asked if I understood. In fact, I didn't. He asked me why I approached him I said I wanted to learn a trick to make you smile. But he said you looked troubled I said, you can read minds, too? He said, a magician is observant. Then he taught me a trick to see how you react. Give me the ring. Yin. What must I do to make you happy? Hey you! A thief! Who are you? Stop! Come down. Step aside! If you'd wanted to return the ring. You could do it yourself I just wanted you to know I always carry it with me. You should know I come back for you. It's dangerous approaching Bully Lei. You still care for me. What do you want? Come with me I can't leave until I find my father. Master Liu is imprisoned... Along with their comrades. We want to overthrow the warlords. Bully Lei often takes you to magic shows. So we asked Mr. Chang to collaborate. Capture Lei as a hostage to swap prisoners? Yes. What if he refuses? Kill him. That will put my father's life in danger. Ms. Liu. Your father's life can stop Lei from collaborating with foreign powers! I won't help you. Mr. Chang. Which side do you think she's on? Let us talk in private I just wanted to know if I'm wrong to return. If out of jealousy, then you're wrong. Stop her, tie her up! Hold it! Li Yi, give me some time. Ready. Action. Satou-san said... He traveled from Japan to China and fell in love with me... at first sight. Am I truly... that beautiful? Cut! Change scene. Bully. You've come to visit me! How did I do? You're normally a good speaker but why out of breath when delivering lines? This is how leading ladies all act! I must change costumes now. Please sign. Kun-shan, what does it say? "Acknowledgement of Arms Delivery." The weapons were not gifts to me? This is international protocol otherwise Mitea-san can't account for them. This is like a receipt for accounting purposes. For accounting... Then what's this? "Declaration of Loyalty to Ching Dynasty." Didn't we cut off our pigtails long ago? But people miss the good old days. Our country is powerful because we've an emperor. Mitea-san, do I look like an emperor? If I were emperor I'd gather all the red light district beauties as my own harem! Indulging in my own pleasure palace. How nice! May I read your fortune, general. "Dragon with Regrets." It means you've the power to rise. However... there's danger ahead. What is it? Your dragon cannot soar too high. Otherwise, he may fall to death. Therefore, accept your destiny. Yes, the general should support the emperor. Well... Action! Excuse me. A bath! Please, stop it! Son of a gun! What are you doing. How dare you touch my woman! I won't allow my woman show nudity. Change the script. He's not going to cooperate with us! What did he say? The director appears to be saying... the storyline demands that Mrs. Lei bares all I'm paying for this movie do what I said. Let's just kill this jerk! What did he say? He's saying that... even if you're the investor. You can't change the script. Absolutely ridiculous! If you don't change it, I'll kill you! Please calm down, sir! Let's talk it over. It's brand new. How could it misfire? Whose side are you on? Yours of course, general. Remember. A clever dog is still a dog. Yes, sir. Mitea-san I'm sorry that I killed your man. Don't worry, there are many directors. We'll hire a new one tomorrow! Careful, it's hot! Sir, Mr. Chang is here. Please. Sit. Your trick didn't work I don't think "true love" exist in this world. Have you ever seen the wind? You've never seen it yet it exists. Clever. Do you want me to be frank with you or to flatter you? Please speak freely. If I say something wrong, will you shoot me? Are you testing me? A great mind is broad enough for ships. Mine is broad enough for tanks. You think you can make me mad? Alright, let me ask you. Does Madam 7th love you "freely"? Can't say a word... so the rumors are true. What rumors? Rumors say that she has a fianc. But you've locked her up... Did you? Maybe... That's why... She hates you, how could she be nice to you? That's why I never forced her. No matter how... Never? Not even a kiss. You see what I mean? The general is a true gentleman. Of course! I'm much better than her fianc! That man is fat and short old, ugly a whoring gambler and curse all the time. Surely not. Yes! I admit I'm at fault. But he's even worse! Yin loved him. Yet he ran off to Europe. Vanished without trace. He's such a jerk! I'm not talking about you. Why look insulted? I didn't sleep well last night... I heard that her fianc isn't that bad. My foot. He makes my blood boil. You were talking about "free love" just now. How exactly does one love freely? First give her freedom! Let her go? No, I can't! Teach me how to make her love me... without setting her free. Then trick her to fall in love with you. It takes practice to deceive someone. The general has a good memory. Good, there's another trick! Pay attention. What's this? "Look for Love." How profound! Women love the attention of a man. Gaze at Liu Yin like that every day. With desire and hunger for her... She'll be happy. That makes sense! But how did you know her name? You just said it! I did? Really? Yes... Did he? Children don't lie I've an idea, general. Invite me to perform for her privately. Let me befriend her. And figure out what she really wants. Good idea. Good. Come tonight! Ok. Turn this way, right? Relax your muscles or you'll hurt your neck. Holy cow will it break my neck? Rhythm is the key. Yin! Chang just taught me a new trick. Let me show you! - Take a seat. - Okay. Let me help you. Good! Thanks. My neck... my neck! Enough, Chang Hsien! Be careful, general I'm fine... Yin, you do care for me I'm so happy. Come and lets happy together tonight. Let's play. - Eeny meeny. - Miny moe. - Catch the tiger. - By the toe. - If it hollers. - Let it go! You're good! Ok... I drink. Help yourself. The general may have lots of friends. But few are invited to drink with him. So Chang has become your close friend I wish I'd met him earlier. What do you two talk about? Life, philosophy and relationships. He knows everything about magic and even love! Was it a rewarding discussion? Yes! We exchanged views on "free love". But I wasn't convinced... Can general elaborate? Of course! Traditional marriage was arranged by parent. Many couples have grown old together! It's wrong. The man usually gets to choose... Instead of the woman. It's so unfair. No, no... Many women wait until their husband's death in order to resume their freedom. Really? Yes! That's arranged marriage doesn't entail happiness, right? But "free love" also has its downside. Too much freedom. You may love the wrong person. Right! Just like you! You chose your fianc. Was it the right choice? He still ran away. One thing is for certain. If one side is unwilling it won't end well. In fact... Even if both sides are willing, it may not end well! You both appear to have strong opinions. Let me ask some questions. Mr. Chang. Explain different types of love. Love can spring from sympathy gratitude companionship... but nothing can compare to the eternal power of a first love. What is love then? Love is tricky. It can't be calculated like arithmetic nor quantified like physics. It's mystical. There is love borne out of fantasy but unrealistic some borne out of desire but unattainable. Like a jinx. That's why you must remain sober. But I can't help it! Last question. If your mom and I fall in the sea who do you save? Why his mother? Not with "my" mother? Fine, your mother and I who would you save? My mother can swim. Can your mother swim? She's a great swimmer! We're not discussing who can swim. But who would you save? - Save you. - Save you. Why not your mother? Didn't I already say she is a great swimmer. Don't go. Stay a little longer. Madam 7th. A lamp must be lit to shed light. Since we've subject in common today... tell us what's on your mind? Yes, let's settle this! Do you still love your fianc? Or you love the general? How hard is it to say you love me? I know why she is hesitating. You're too emotional. If you can't have love, you steal it. Can't suppress the rebels, put them in jail. Don't talk nonsense to Yin. You didn't kill them? No! I just locked them up! Who would believe you? Would you? No wonder they call you the rotten warlord. Two things I hate the most in life. Being called illiterate and... the rotten warlord! Don't force me! See. You can't control your temper. You must proof it to us I'm warning you, stop it now! I knew you can't accept the truth. Kill me, shoot me in front of them! Officers! Take him away! Yes. Madam 7th, don't go! Sorry, some servant aren't on my side I understand. There're undercovers in this prison. Mind your words. Warden, did you improve the food? Yes sir. Right after you gave the order. Wu and Fan. Remember when you introduced me to Mr. D and Mr. S? I thought they were foreigners. "D" is science, "S" is democracy. Am I right? It's the other way round. Do you really take me as a fool? To accomplish a goal, one must gather strength. Today I ask the Japanese for tanks. Tomorrow, for airplanes and cannon. Once I'm strong enough, I'll kick them out! By then, I'm the boss. If they stage a demonstration. They'll be caught and killed. Don't believe the gossips. Sometimes you can't even trust your own eyes. Just like my magic I'll show you around ls the army camp ahead? Yes, sir! It's restricted. Wait for me here. Follow me! But, sir... Let's go! Go... Master are you ok? Brat you've come at last. Found the cold fire? What happened? I was touring with Yin and the troupe. Liu Kun-shan ambushed us. He wants the 7 Wonders scroll I refused and he had me beaten. What is this 7 Wonders? It's like the cold fire. A combination of 7 elements used to control the mind. Humans are vulnerable. When they're lost, to seek help from spirits. Corrupt men use their skills to deceive people I've seen many becoming swindlers. Liu was my pupil when he was young. Even younger than you. He was smart but obsessed with illusions. Soon he started to swindle people I threw him out. A swindler who ended up fooling himself. Pathetic. The truth depends on your perspective. If people watch us behind the stage. Good act can look fake. Lei wasn't responsible for this. Yin asked him to help me. That's why I'm still alive. Once Yin is safe I'll get you out of here. No rush. Don't alarm our foe now. Liu is desperate for the 7 Wonders. Must be planning something. Use his weakness. Remember. Magic is based on the art of deception. The secret is in the box. There're two kinds of audience. Some want the truth... others revel in the illusion. Which one are you? Illusion is the pleasure. Why ruin it? Yes, truth can often be absurd... Even cruel and ugly. It's better to leave room for imagination. It's the lies that hurt. Looks like you can tell who I am. All magicians are good at keeping secrets. Can you help me find the truth? - Commander Liu - Please. Greetings I long to wear our... Manchurian robes in public. Your Highness, that day will come soon. Your Highness... This is Taga Group's President. Mr. Mitearai. We're honored to work with Your Highness. Wonderful! Thank you! Gentlemen, any request to the mighty spirits? Our restoration. Will the outcome be victorious? Victory will be determined by a single battle. The sign is favorable. When for action? Catch the timing do not delay. Great! Your Majesty how I miss you. We've a new show. Come see the show. Boss, Butler Liu I've found it. It was right under our noses! ...featuring the Golden Touch from the "7 Wonders". "The Scroll of the 7 Wonders." Come back! Who are you? Dare to steal my scroll! Give it to me! Go! Catch. Run? Thief, I've put a curse on you. You'll see by midnight! What was in the bowl? Don't touch it or you'll never get married I've already touched it. Wash your hands with vinegar, not water. "The Golden Touch" "5 Demon Traps." "Invisible Walker." "Magic Labyrinth." "Moving Mountains and Sea." "Almighty Fire." "Magic Bean Army" I've found it... I've finally found it! It's real magic... He's a real sorcerer! Welcome VIP. Mr. Chang, I'm glad that you've come. Madam Hua, he is Peking's greatest magician. Treat him well! If you wish to talk, let's meet in private. Well, leave us alone. You are quite a ladies' man. Cut it out. Give me back the scroll I'll return it once I'm done. It's useless without my guidance. What's your relationship with Liu Wan-yao? He's my master... Just as I thought I've not finished yet! If you smile again I'll make your face... larger than this! He's a rogue pupil of my master. A traitor, too? What do you want? To learn the 7 Wonders I only teach my pupils. You're not one. Make me your pupil. Cut this out, just pay me I'll pay any price. Please sit. Good. One more condition check our karmic connection. How? What's your zodiac? Dog. No. You're a... "turtle" as you never leave your shell behind. Can I borrow it. Here. "Joining forces can break metal." Looks like you've passed the test. Master. Together we can shake the world. You're conspiring with the Japanese behind Lei! How do you know? Your shell is useless I can use mine to predict the day for action! I can help under one condition. Tell me, master I want to be the Imperial Sage. You're one of "us"? My real name is... "Gesaerdu Duoduoshan" I suppose we're on the same side. Yes... I'll definitely recommend my master! Also, you must have figured out... My other motive in approaching Lei. He killed my father and I want vengeance I want to kill that bastard as well... When will you teach me? No rush. You need to fast for 49 days. Wait for a moonless night with northwesterly winds. Your power will be heightened I'll do as you say, Master. You're too important to me I promise to protect you day and night. To keep you safe from Lei. Don't you trust me? I just want you to be safe, Master! Great! Let's have a toast. Bring the wine! Leave now. It'll be too late! Leave me alone. - Let me go! - Listen to me! Let me go. Mr. Chang, Li Yi went to rescue his comrades. You should leave now. Mr. Chang, come with us. We must leave let's go! Remember to come again I will! Sure, see you. How about you? The show must go on right? Yes. Remember... Expect the worse situation. Don't panic when it happens. Just overcome it! From now on I'm relying on you. Madam, the general is here. Both of you, get out! Yes. Yin, did you know? Chang planned to kidnap me! What does he really want? Even Butler Liu is behaving strangely. He became Chang's pupil all of a sudden. He should respect to his master then. Why is he spying on Chang? What the hell is going on? I don't understand it. It's driving me crazy! Chang Hsien is my fianc. He did everything for me. Can you tell Butler Liu not to hurt him? If you save him then I'm yours. You want a baby, don't you? What's the point of having a baby... when his mother... doesn't love me? I've known... from the way you gazed at him at the party if only you would look at me the same way... I'd be satisfied for life I've act a fool my whole life I'm very convincing that I fooled everyone. Someone who plays fool to please you... can't be a bad person, right? Bully I'm sorry if I'd misjudged you. But you can't blame me because I didn't cause any of this. Fine! Will you kill him? Will you? Chang Hsien! Come out now. Where're you? What's the fuss? You little pimp! This one is for Yin! She's the best woman I've ever met. You break her heart! You stole my woman. Don't be so self-righteous! Why didn't say earlier? What makes you think I'll kill you? I won't let you go? You really mean it? What? Don't play dumb. You said if I'd come clean with you. You would let us go. Screw you. Stop playing around with words... Are you giving her back to me? Never! Go to hell. Stop it. What did you find out? Liu conspired with Japanese to restore Ching dynasty. All those filmmakers are spies. Once they succeed, they'll kill you. He doesn't have the nerve... You know he hids something under his hat? Under the hat? I must find out what it is! Help! I'll kill you! Don't run! General. Aren't you suppose to be on set today? Bastard! I thought that you were just a homeless eunuch-turned-street-performer I pitied you and made you a soldier. Now you sleeping with my wife? I can forgive you for keeping your pigtail. But how can you justify that "thing" in your pants! If I don't kill you today I'm not Bully Lei! Don't shoot!! Please don't kill him. We were childhood lovers I sang and he performed magic acts. We planned to get married when the time is right. But the war separated us. When I found him he's already in your army... and I was already your wife I didn't dare to tell the truth. Do us a favor... Kill us both. Take your man and leave. - Kill him! - If I ever see him again I'll castrate him myself! Get out! You let him go? He's already gone. You're really letting him off? Chang Hsien. Why so cold-blooded? Didn't you hear that they were childhood lovers separated by war. Compare to you. Their story is more... heartbreaking and worthy of sympathy. You're suggesting that... he won't repay your kindness with malice that he won't conspire against you that he'll stop restoring the Ching dynasty. Is that so? Remorse? A little. Go after him now! No problem I'll raid Mitearai tonight with the other generals... - and then... - It'll be too late! Act now! My friends enjoys nightlife I bet they are still sleeping. Come. To get a massage? Good idea! The night's still young. Let's go I'll show you a new bathhouse in Peking! Why don't you call your friends first? Tell them to prepare. No hurry! Get a massage first! Taga Samurais Butler Liu has been exposed. Time for us to take charge! Bully has uncovered our plan. The future of the empire is at stake. We can't wait. Take action now. Kill Bully Lei! Long live the empire! Madam 7th! Yin! Let's go! Stay! Don't move! Get me General Kao. Found him yet? No. Maybe they've all gone to the brothel Butler Liu has engineered a coup. He's holding many families hostage! Here they come! Kill! Take these! Daisy, Peach, Apricot, Melon Seed! Lotus seed, Raisin are all here. Attack! Mr. Chang, protect the general I'll fight! Let's go told you to call first but you'd wanted a massage. It was your idea! Stop it! Where are we going? - This way! - That way! Straight ahead! Be careful! Bully! None of our business now. Time to rescue the master. We can't leave him here! Yin! Meet me at the tavern! Chang Hsien. - Bully! - Where's Chang Hsien? He went to the tavern. Lei Bully. You're dead! Yin. What are you doing? Yin, ignore him. You still rage with jealousy. Once you've letdown a woman you can't win her back with any magic. Trust me! Come over now! Go with him! Chang Hsien I hate you! Bully! Be careful! Bully, gel up! I am stuck I want to see their corpses! Douse the fire! Watch out for the grenades! Long live His Majesty! Please be seated! Ladies and gentlemen. This century's greatest miracle is upon us. A divine army will descend. And destroy our enemies. Restoring His Majesty to the throne. Here comes our Imperial Sage. My men are all over this place. If your magic fails to work I'll offer his head to the mighty spirits. Now. Guardians of the spiritual worlds. Rise under my command warriors and horses from the grass and beans. Come forth! In the name of heaven and earth I summon thunderbolts and lightnings. Destroy thy enemy with fire and blaze. Abracadabra! Conjure. Bastard! Why is he throwing beans at us? Idiots! This is fake! This magic is amazing! Commander Liu, what's going on? You'd said he was a real sorcerer. Creating an army by magic? You must be joking. Something wrong! Forget it. Let's go. Wait! If magic really exists in this world I know that everyone must hope for miracles. Just have faith. Your dreams... will come true. It's a movie! "Director by Chang Hsien." "Starring: Bully Lei, Liu Yin." What is it? Movie is fake. Don't be fooled. Don't be serious! Why are they still alive? Hurry up. Don't break it I want to see their corpses. Douse the fire! Watch out for the grenades! Go. Liu Kun-shan let me make your dreams come true. Baby I love you... Are you hungry? My dream has finally come true... Mine too. Where's my dream? - My dream... - My dream? The 7 Wonders create illusions. Only through hard work can dreams be realized I've worked hard all my life! But you took the wrong path. Your dreams will end up nightmares. Liu! The day has come... to eradicate all evil! Kill! Master. The show is almost over. Just open fire! Even without wine, life intoxicates us. Love, hate, fame, fortune. Life is like a play. Magicians can make counterfeits as good as real but they can never alter a woman's heart I'm not being arrogant, but I know my mother best. One angry look my father turns white as a ghost. Grandpa. Let's go watch the last scene. Ok let's go! Bro Bully, don't you abandon your troops even power and fortune? Didn't you used to call me a Rotten Warlord? Now I have nothing. What else can you come up with? I was only joking. Don't be so sensitive. Where do you plan to go? I'm invited to World Magic Championships in England. But... I'd wanted to go to France. People can experience many facets of life on stage. So I want to make films. Hope there's a future in it! I'll go to Prussia to do weapon research. One day I'll build a flying bomb to kill enemies from distance. And you? I'm still undecided. There's no time for jokes. Yin, just pick me! Dad I now know why 7 Wonders do nothing for me. It's because I've no ambition I don't desire either of them. Why regret the past and worry about the future? Why neglect the best things in life in order to feed our ambition? They're just 2 insensitive, rotten scoundrels. - She means you. - You! You don't need me. Better find yourself a nanny! Go find one! Goodbye. No need for farewells. Father, let's go. What're you waiting for? Go after her! You've 6 wives at home. Go back! I got rid of them. Now it's fair game! Bullshit. Yin, here comes your baby, Bully! - Shut up, you're so annoying! - I love you. See a revenge from a beauty! Let's split up and follow them. Till we meet again!
