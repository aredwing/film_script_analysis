Our job here is to shape it. A dog can be dynamic, aggressive, a fighter, coward or affectionate. It requires work, patience, and attention from us. Every dog, your dog is waiting from us to teach him how to behave. You understand? We, we are here to determine what behavior the dog should have. Do you want a pet, or a friend? a companion? Or a keeper that respects its master and obeys our orders? Do you understand? I do. Rex! Rex! What do you mean, you can't? Sorry. It's not for me, but for you that we do this. Sorry.

I clean the carpet to eliminate bacteria. - Do you want my head clamp? - Very much. What will you give me in return? You want this pencil? It has an eraser at the end. No. This measuring tape? You press here and it contracts back . No. Come close and lick me here. Then it's yours. Does it disgusts you? No. - Shall we dance? - I'm not in the mood. And we don't have enough time.

I have one already. This one is phosphorescent. What does that mean? It glitters in the dark. Where did you get it ? I can't tell you. Do our parents know you have it? No. It can become yours, very easily. Where do you want me to lick you? At the shoulder. You'll buy chocolates? Only if there's it's on your way. Any kind. Yes those are good. Me too.

The eldest threw the plane over the wall. Could you get it? - Where is it? - Right outside. I'll try. How did it happened? What did you tell them? Good. I'll tell them, too. It's a good opportunity. Yes. The temperature will rise and the wind will fall. OK. No, it's time to put an end to it. Its exhausting for everyone I agree. You're absolutely right. Yes. Your brother is dead. A creature like the one in the garden tore hip apart. On one hand... he made a huge mistake, venturing out ill prepared.. On the other hand, he was my son and I feel sorry for him The animal that threatens us is a "cat". The most dangerous animal there is He eats meat. Children's flesh in particular. After lacerating it's victims with its claws, It devours them with sharp teeth. The face and whole body of the victim If you stay inside, you are protected We have to be ready. in case it invades the house or the garden. Our dear brother we're sorry you couldn't kill the cat, as I did. We will miss you ... despite the mistakes you did It's a pity that this would happen to you and I wasn't able to use my knowledge to save you. My dear brother, I would have never imagine that things could go so wrong. I hoped that you'd survive on the supplies i secured for you. But there are too many dangers. I'm so sad ... You press three times on the chest. With force. One two three. Then you block the nose, open the mouth and you blow. I am pregnant. A boy and a girl. Twins. How about two boys? No, a girl and boy. - Are you sure? - Yes. How about triplets? It would be too much. You're right. Twins. The same thing on your backs. The same thing facing front. O.K. Dive in. Ready? Soon, your mother will give birth to two children and a dog. I know some of you will resent having to share a room clothes, or even toys. But you must look on the bright: You'll have two more people to care for you. The family will grow bigger And I want us to applaud your mother for this big gift. I don't want to share my room. If you're a good girl, you will not have to. I will be good. I don't want to share either. If your behavior and your performance improves, I may not have to give birth. But if things don't change, I will have no other choice. But I won't hear a thing about the dog. He will be born as soon as possible Great, darling, bravo to you all. Dry yourself and come get your reward. Dry your hands, or it won't stick anymore. One more thing. Your performance was worse than last time I shouldn't say more.. Oh! A plane. It fell in the garden. Not so hard, you're hurting me. Like that? Softer. Like this? Good. You want me to lick you so you'll give me gift? I have nothing to give you. It's okay. here's a nice spot. Good morning, Dad. Good morning. How many hours did you sleep About 9. Be careful of the pinky! Daddy! There are two fish in the pool. What kind? I think they're sargos but I'm not sure. You should catch them. Mom will be so glad if I'm right. I'll be there in a minute. There's three of them. It was just two before. the third probably just swam in. The most creative time for man is ...? Between 30 and 40 years of age. And for women? Between 20 and 30. A child is ready to leave his house when ...? When the right dogtooth falls off. Or the left one, doesn't really matter. At that time, the body is ready to face all dangers. To leave the house in safety one should use the car. When can one learn to drive? When the right dogtooth grows back. Or the left, it doesn't really matter. Mom, what is a "cunt"? Where did you learn that word? On a case on top of the VCR. A cunt is a large lamp. Example: The cunt switched of, and the room got all dark. Do you want to hear your grandfather singing? Yes Dad loves us. Mom loves us. Do we love them? Yes, we love them. I love my brothers and sisters because they love me too. Spring fills my house. Spring floods... my little heart. My parents are proud of me, because I do my best. But I'm always trying to do better. My house, you're beautiful and I love you. And never ... I will never leave you. I dreamed of you the other day. I was in a forest with your father. In the evening we grilled potatoes. Suddenly, we heard noise in a bush. It was you ... you were a zombie. Your father and I, we threw stones at you. - But we couldn't hit you. - What was I? A zombie. - You know what a zombie is? - Yes. - Do you see dreams? - Sure. Tell me a recent one. I saw Mom falling in the pool. And then what? Nothing. Just that. I've brought another gift. Hair gel. You put it in your hair to model it. I don't like it. What do you mean? I do not like this gift. Besides, I don't believe you. You said that the headband sparkled. It was a Lie. It's true! It sparkles. You did something wrong. I don't believe you. Look here. Look at me. Look. If you want me to lick you, you have to offer me something better. I have nothing else. I want these. I can't give them to you. - I want them. - Impossible. Then you must leave. I can't give them to you. Get out. I will never lick youagain! And I'll tell my parents you gave me a headband. And that you asked me to lick you down low, at your keyboard. And all that happened. You know what dad do if he finds out that I lick your keyboard? You should give them back to me next week. Mommy, what's a zombie? Where did you hear this word? Don't remember. Dad probably said it. A zombie is a small yellow flower. What are you doing there? I couldn't sleep. I'm nervous. I'm afraid. If you won't go out in the garden alone nothing will happen to you. I won't let anything happen to you. Dad, I want to learn how to fight. What did you say? I can't hear you. When do I learn to fight? You can shut down your robot? I'll fight, so you won't have to. You need to use your head for something else than a punching bag. Like I do. Your head does not look like a punching bag. No. That's good. Thanks. It looks like a baseball glove. You're a wise guy, ha? Mr. Balboa, Mr. Creed's on the phone. There are all kinds of sharks. Hammerhead, the blue shark, mako, white shark. it's unlikely that those fools got the right one ... This kind of shark does not live here. Highly unlikely. I don't mean that this is not the shark we look for. I think it is, Martin. He's a man-eater. Man-eater! His jaws do not correspond to the bites on the victim. I want to be sure. So do you. We all want to be sure, No? Anyone else seen them? No. Nobody. Bring me the masking tape. I want you to call me Bruce. What is Bruce? A name. When you call me Bruce, I'll respond I also want a name like this. Choose a new one. Whatever you want. I want to be called Backbone. You can't be called that. A backbone is a backbone. Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Your house is very nice. Just as we pictured it. Thank you. Where is the perfume I gave you? In the bathroom. It is a very good perfume My wife insisted that we should buy that perfume as a present for you At first, we were thinking of getting you a vase. but we thought it would not find it's place in your house. You live here alone? Yes. My parents live on the 4th. I wish your children get all the wrong stimuli and grow to be bad. I wish it with all my heart. Let this be the punishment for your wrongdoings to my family. She hit me with a hammer! He's lying, it wasn't me! I just saw a cat with a hammer jumping out the window. She did it. The pain makes you delirious. He needs a plaster and painkillers. It must be broken, Dad. Did you do like we said? You have taken precautions? He didn't have time, dad. From what i saw it was a really fast cat. Very, very fast. You spend less time with children. Don't cry. The children will see you. Have you've combed your hair today? Yes. I had a hard day. We'll have to replace Christina. We can't trust anyone. Nobody should come here anymore. I think about handing the task to our elder daughter. Unless we let him decide for himself. That's maybe better. If you do it again, I'll gut you, you bitch. I swear on my daughter's life that you and your gang will soon flee the neighborhood. Mom! I found two little zombies. Should I bring them? Mom! Mom! Today is our wedding anniversary. To celebrate, we'll eat cake and decorate the house with lights and balloons. Sit up. I think my dogtooth is shaky. I don't think so. It doesn't even move. - Did you sleep well last night? - Great. Dad, I'm tired. Can I stop now? Yes, my darling, if you can't keep on. Enough! Dad, you'll give me the spear gun? I've already said, it is dangerous. I can lick you ear if you want. Bruce! Bruce! I'll go get the dog tomorrow. The 5th stage of training must be completed by now. If you don't drink your orange juice while it's fresh, it's no use.
