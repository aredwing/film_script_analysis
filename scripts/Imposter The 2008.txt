Thank you. Some people are saying you guys aren't really a Christian band. We are what we are. (female) Critics say you only mention Jesus once in your newest album. (Johnny C) Mo, mice. Two times, two times, right? (female) Twice then. You sing about you quite a bit. Well, when l'm talking to James, l don't say James at the beginning of evey sentence, do l? l mean that'd sound pretty silly. (James) It's all right, man. l know exactly who l am and what l'm supposed to say. lf l don't measure up to somebody's expectations or list of rules, l'm okay with that. l plan to live up to one person's rule, and His name is Jesus. (Johnny C) See, mree times. Daddy, hug! Hos my sweety? Want to see some hip hop? Yeah, you got hip hop for me? - Hi, baby. - Hi sweety. Howare you?

Don't you dare make this about me. Hey, Tara. What kind offather does this? l'm a great father. l'm a good father. l can provide for our daughter, l take care ofyou, don't l? All right, Iook, you're right. l was addicted to the oxy. lt was a rough moment for me, but that's gone. l'm clean, l promise. You liar. You stand there and you lie to me! She's gonna hear you. l believed you. Believe this... l'm done. All right, look, Tara, l'm sory. You knowl-- l mean l've stopped this. l mean it's been diicult but l am done: Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. l just want... l have to go. You going to Texas before the sho l'll meet you guys at the church. You can't go like this. You can't--you can't get in the car like this. l need to go. Not with Elizabeth in the car. You cannot go like this. This is not good. lt's risky. Get out of my way. Please don't do this. This isn't fair to me. l've got ministry tonight.

Can you sign this? You're not gonna sell this on the internet, are you? - No way. - Can you sign this? - l can bro. Mine too. Great show tonight. Thanks, Frank. You all ready for us to Texas? Not as big as an auditorium, butwe'll be ready. l thought everything was bigger in Texas. That's the auditorium you married my sister in. Sounds great, Frank. lt's never about the numbers. No, it's always about the numbers. Tara said she and Elizabeth made it in safely. Yeah, l wonderwhy you didn't go with them. Hey, do they know it's an acoustic set? Yup. Go clean the bathroom, John. We're out of here. Clean the bathroom, Johnny boy. Hey, it's good for you. Frontman always cleans the bathroom. (Johnny C) James and Johnny C, ople mink we're bromers butwe're not,just friends from childhood. James took me in. He needed a project, he let me sing, so l dowhatJames says. He's the brains, the music, the lyrics. He writes it, l make it beautil. lfl'm going to do such a diry job, l decided long ago l deserved a lime me 'me. [music] (Eliabem) Uncle Prom Hey, sweety. What does that machine do? Well, that's what uncle Proff cleans the floorwith. Can l drive it? No, no, l think you better Iet uncle Pro do that. l got something for you though. Can l go play? You can go play. So what's wrong? l think Johnny might be using again. And you finally left him? No. Elizabeth needs a father. Well, l hope she gets one. (James) l will follow ~All of Me~ with ~Believe is an Act.~ (Johnny C) Uh-uh, we can't do that. We always do ''Believe'' before ''All of Me.'' That change will mess me up big time. (James) Ah, we've been doing it this way the whole tour long. We have? Tara and Elizabeth gonna be waiting? Johnny? Huh? What? Never seem to find the time to finish beating these rugs. l find that hard to believe. You doing all right? Not sure l can keep holding it all together. l'm not sure you need to. [music] # Is there a code that l can't crack? # # N4 life is slipping right o the tracks. # # Don't even know if l want it back # # so take it away from me. # #And l find your beautiful mind in eveything # # and eveything is all l need. # # l find your beautiful eyes see eveything, # # so show me something beautiful. # # l find your beautiful eyes see right through me, # # so show me what you want me to be. ## # so show me what you want me to be. ## He's doing it right now. He's singing about the love ofJesus and he's up there mentally undressing that woman. Why won't you say anything? How long do you want to keep giving him permission. Look, we both played with the painkillers. l was wrong. All right. Go ahead, give him a pass, again. And when Elizabeth gets into drugs or bad men, go ahead give her a pass too. That's not fair. When you defend behavior like Johnny's, who are you really giving a pass to? All right, John goes out, gets himself wasted, drags himself home again, what do you get out ofthis? Nothing. What do you get out of this Tara, what's the payo? The payoff is a deadbeat drug-strung husband. No. What do you get out ofthis? What did your mother getout of her relationship with your father? She got to be the hero. (ProM Okay, good. What else? She got to be the good one, always putting him down. And what else? She got to be the rescuer. So ifyour dad had cleaned up his act, just like your mother wanted, would she be happy? Hey, great way to finish the tour. What'd you think of worship before you went on? Oh, it was great man, you've always had a good voice. Um, well, you know where to find me if you need a newsinger. You seen Johnny? Yeah, thanks for coming out tonight. No, problem, you were great. Oh, thank you. Yeah, take care you guys. Bye-bye, nice to meet you. Thanks. Thank you. Have a good night. Hey, babe. Just doing the autograph thing. Who was she, Johnny? Oh, you know l'm just doing my lead singer duties, nothing. You were looking at her more than anyone else during that entire concert. (Johnny C) l can't see passed the lights, you know? l start looking atthe lights and l start to stare at somebody, that's just, that's what l do. Come on, don't start on me with that, all right? We've got the whole world here and all you can be is unhappy? My voice, you knowour band, it's eveything you ever wanted and more, you kno No, Johnny, it's given you eveything you've everwanted. (Johnny C) What is that? Look, babe, we sing in front ofthousands and thousands of people. Evey night, we change lives, that's what we do. All right, Mr. Changing Lives, tell me right here right now, have you ever cheated on me? What, l was just thinking, l'm just thinking. Just thinking. Great. Great. Elizabeth and l are staying here. You're staying here? Look, l don't know what you're strung out on. Let me autograph this for you. Leave me alone, man. [music] [music] # There's a place in my heart that's empty # # and l have searched the world to find # # someone or something to fill it, # # but it's harder the longer it's denied. # # It's a hunger and l can't fill it. # # It's a thirst in a dy land, but my heart is starving # # for something but l'm stuck in the sinking sand. # - Thanks forthe pizza. -Alright, no problem. #And l've searched in evey direction # # when l knowyou're calling my name, # # but l choose not to listen # # 'cause l know l'll have to change. # # So this empty still remains. # (Johnny C) Are you coming back home? Please sweey, l miss you, and Eliabeth too. l miss you too. You knowshe wrote another song for you. (Johnny C) She did? for me? Yeah. Oh, babe, it would be so great ifyou could just visit just once, please. Okay. # It shom its face in expectation # # and again when achievement's not enough. # # The more l gain, the more l see it, # # but my heart still cries it's not enough... # [phone ringing] Hello. Oh, l'm sory, l thought this was my phone. # But l choose not to listen, # # cause l knowl'll have to change. # # So this empty still remains. # [music] (male) You think we got what we need? Yeah, it sounds good. Hey, Johnny. Fo-five minutes late, Johnny. Man, you guys are never ready for me. Ready this time. [coughing] What's wrong? Man, there was a dog barking Iast night outside my house and it just wouldn't stop. Johnny! You got anything you want to talk about? Hos Tara, Elizabeth? They're fine. They're back at the house right now and they'rejust sleeping away like babies. Sleep, sleep, beautiful sleep. lt's so beautiful. lt's like they have intestinal worms or something. lntestinal worms, you knowthat's a great lyric. lfyou don't like worms, howabout seepage? l've always liked the word, ''Seepage.'' ln fact seepage rhymes with sleepage. [singing] They, oh, they've got seepage in the sleepage. Whatdo you think, Brian? What's going on with you? Man, you don't even want to know. What is going on? You don't want me to ruin yourworld. How much oxy are you taking? (Johnny C) It's prescription. There's no pharmacy label on this and no doctor. His name's not on there. l never did this. That's my stuff. l'm sory, Brian. (rian) It's okay, but listen, Johnny. The label is voicing concern. lf this gets out, the Christian market will turn on the whole band. lt's not gonna happen this time. You knowwhat? Can you just go get a drink ofwater or something? (Johnny C) Man, you know eveybody wants mis, the money, the fame... ...to make a difference, send a message, me, the James project. l've been drinking for quite some time now. Were you, on stage? What do you think, man? Tara left me and she took Elizabeth with her and they went down to Texas. And you knowwhat? l think it's better for eveybody, including you because there's not gonna be as much tension. There won't be all the crying. l mean good riddance. Why? Because she's never happy. (James) Wm'd she Ieave you? She went home. Why did she Ieave you, Johnny? Because l've been sleeping around, man. ls matwhatyou wanted to hear? Okay, there l've said it. You're done. What do you mean l'm done? Wait a second, what about all those Christian virtues you talk about all the time like forgiveness, compassion and grace? You knowwhat? You're real quick tojudge. Actually l think l've been too slow. You knowwhat? This band is gonna be nothing without me. (rian) John, as you all agreed when you signed me partnership, all monies go to the spouses. You'll have to talk to her bank accounR, eveythi'ng. l knowthis will be hard on you. Let's pray. Dear Lord Jesus, you say when two or more are gathered in your name that you are here with us. We pray today that-- (Johnny C) l was still too strung out to understand, butone thing l knew was mat Chrisianese wasn'tgoing to save my soul. ...Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. [music] (male radio announcer) It's T:O, good morning, Chris and Dawn here with ya. (Dawn) And Chris has got a big stoy to tell ya about. We've got a huge music nem stoy coming out of Nashville this morning. lt looks like Grand Design Iead singer Johnny C has leR the band to pursue a different ministy direction. Dawn, l'm never sure exactly what that means. l think it's short for he wants to have his own solo career. (Chris) Yeah, maybe. Well, so now what? They go out and nd a new front man? Well, l mean they could but James Palmer's always been the main force behind Grand Design anyway. He's got a great voice. l think they should let James sing his own songs. Oh, he doesn't have that unique Johnny C voice though. (Dawn) Nobo6 has thatvoice. Well, we've got the full stoy on the web site at 897powem.com. The question is though, does this mean the end of Grand Design orthe beginning of a newera forthe band. Well, James can do the tourwith us now. (Johnny C) Looking back at self, makes me sick. l asked hr mercy, but mercy can only come aMrjudgment. l asked hr mercy, but mercy can only come aMrjudgment. Dear friends, stop and imagine for a moment that there you are in heaven walking on the streets of gold, singing, shouting, ''Gloy.'' But up in front of you, you see a family that was your next door neighbor on earth. They're sobbing, cying in terror this huge angel drags them to a door marked ''Hell.'' The fatherturns to you and says, ''Neighbor, why did you not witness to me?'' Sobbing he turns to his family and walks into eternal damnation. Then you see the Lord, nail-scarred hands outstretched and He said, ''l did it all for you. Why did you not witness to them?'' Yes, sir, that's right. (male preacher) Ifyou don't tell them, who will? The single most important thing in the Kingdom of God is to save the lost. Amen. lmagine, in that great throne room of God, you're standing there and the Lord says, ''So how many souls did you bring me?'' And behind you are dozens of people standing, shouting, thanking God because you witnessed to them. What if no one stood behind you? Would he say, ''Well done thou good and faithful saint''? l think not. No, l know not. You want prosperity? Save me lost. You want t be happy? Save me lost. You want a good life? Save the lost. Say this prayer in your heart wim me. Lord, l know You want me to be prosrous and happy and have a good life when l save the lost. No loss anyway, devil's music. You can start living your own life, do some real work for the Lord. Yeah, concerning that, l want to-- well, l need some help starting a ministy. l need money. You know l can send out the invitations to speak and sing, and l can talk to the churches, work out some love oerings. You know l can still be an entertainerjust like you. Still have that souped-up car of yours? Still have that Cadillac Landau? Well son, when you have your own nonprofit organization set up, let me know. That's it, l need help to set it up, you know legal fees and what not. Why'd they really let you go? l don't know, musical differences. Don't lie to me, son. l was messing around. They fired you for doing a little hound dogging? Yeah, hound dogging. A rock 'n' roll star girls love rock 'n' roll stars: They fired you forthat? Yeah, dad, could you imagine. lf l was an evangelist like you, well, maybe l could have kept my job. Your mother knows who she married. Does anybody else? Fine. You can live with me. You can sing a hymn before l speak. No, l got work to do down in Tennessee. So if l pick up the phone right now and called James, he's gonna tell me that's the reason you got kicked out? l might have had a drink or two... ...and maybe something else. l don't support no drug addict and l can see it in youreyes. lt's not like that, dad. You're unteachable. l taught you never to get caught. Oh, come on, dad. [music] (Johnny) The next w monms were a blur. l had enough money and friends who liked my mOney t keep me busy.

You know sometimes l hate the day l met you. (ProM Yeah, get that one a lot. Look, he's got a choice to make. lfwe ty to shortcut the process and make it easier for him, then it's gonna be that much harder for him to make the right choice. # l'm gonna chance to choose to follow# #Your heart and believe. # #And l'm gonna lose myself and start again on my knees. # # l found the way to be free. # # l'm falling down on my knees, # # and l'm gonna chance to choose again. ## l can't get a hold ofJerome, okay?

Come on, Oprah, we gotta take this. [music] Hey, Pro. Yeah. Why did you ask me if l was a Christian, you know, a while back? You mean a believer? Why do you think l asked you, John? Romans 10:9 says two things. The first is that you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord. But l confessed evey night all across the county in front ofthousands of people. Yeah, but there's a second part. You believe in your heart that He rose from the dead. Believe. So what does believe Iook like, John? l don't know. Well, l guess you better find out. [music] # Push me overthe edge. # # Push me overthe edge. # # Oh, oh. # Yeah, l don't believe you. l knowyou don't. l've given you plenty of reasons not to. Please forgive me, Frank. [Elizabeth singing in Spanish] (Johnny C) My daughter is so beautiful. l think ifs the rsttime l gaed at her without looking at myself first.

But l don't know. l don't know if l want to get back together. l understand. You can say the words, but l don't know if in another hour, you're gonna be back to the same games. [Eliabeth singing] And even though you're herfather, l can't even trust you to be alone with her. Tara, what can l do to earn back that trust? A long track record... ...of keeping your word. (Johnny C) Part of me is really saddened. l would love to have a quick fix, but she's right. l would love to have a quick fix, but she's right. So you expect eveyone to actually believe that you're a changed man? No, but l was hoping they would. No, man, l can't. lt's all right, John, it's yours ifyou want it. All right. Thanks, man. Yeah. Do you still play? Who says l don't? l mean like recording and touring? Purpose. So it's more noble to be ajanitorthan be a musician? ls that all you see, ajanitor? So you think you'll ever hit the stage again? lf there was purpose. You knowwhat, man? l mean... They don't believe me. l mean what happens if l can't get Tara back? Then Tara doesn't come back to you. You can pull the nails out ofthe board but you still gotta deal with the hole. So whatever happened to walking down the aisle and eveything's always all right? Why did you walk down the aisle, John? lf you start to followJesus, you want to serve Him, be His disciple, just walking down the aisle to get yourselffixed? That's still all about you, isn't it? You have to seek Him first, put Him first, all this other stuff will follow. Yeah, man. Hey, by the way, l spoke to the senior pastor. He said maybe we can use another janitor around here for a while. You interested? You mean l'd be working with you? Yeah. All right. (Johnny C) You're really cray, aren't ya? l knowthat. You got family? Of course, l got family. Thank you vey kindly for asking. That's it? For now. You get back with your wife yet? Not yet. l don't think she wants me back. Oh, man, l know l know exactly what you're talking about that there. N4, my wife's whole family didn't like me. l can't imagine why. l wasn't all just about good Iooks back then, you understand. l had intellect. We're gonna be in the same church so we're gonna be really uncomfortable. Yup, comfort the oppressed, oppress the comfortable. l bet you spend a lot oftime in soup kitchens all overthe place, right? Yeah, yeah, as a matter offact that's true. l mean l knowall ofthem, the whole area. l mean l knowall ofthem, the whole area. The one down in Dallas. That's kind ofthe best one. You knowthe story about the prodigal son? Of course, the prodigal son, l love that stoy. That's a really good one. You knowthe soup panty down in Dallas? That's the one that told that. He told itjust right. That man know how to tell that stoy. You the prodigal son now? (Johnny C) l'm not a Christian rock star anymore. My wife doesn't know if she wants to get back tether. My dad doesn'ttrust me and at some int, l'm gonna have to deal with a mad loan shark missing O grand, but now instead ofwearing the cosmes, l'm learning to take them off. # Masquerading as a man with a reason, # # my charade is the event ofthe season. # #And if l claim to be a wise man, # # it surely means that l don't know. # # On a stormy sea of moving emotion. # # Tossed about l'm like a ship on the ocean. # # l set a course forwinds offortune, # # but l hear the voices say. # # Cary on my wayward son. # # Forthere'll be peace when you are done. # # Lay your weay head to rest, now don't you cy no more. # [music] # Cary on, # # you will always remember. # # Cary on, # # Nothing equals the splendor. # # Nowyour life's no longer empty. # # Surely heaven waits foryou. # # Cary on my wayward son. # # Forthere'll be peace when you are done. # # Lay your weay head to rest. # # Now don't you cy no more. # [music] # Like a note thrills in a song When l play it again, # # it's gone 'cause it was never in the sound # # And it keeps me wanting that mysterious thing. # # Like a night is waiting for a dawn # # Evey prayer l say # # a little closer # # to my resting place. # # a little closer # # Where my final breath is the beginning to never needing # #And l will find my last Amen, my lastAmen # #And while the thrills are fading # # Thejoy is in the waiting # # Somewhere in the grand design # # it's good to be unsatisfied. # # It keeps the faith of hope a little more alive. # #A little closer a little closer. #' # Where my final breath is the beginning to never needing # #And l will find my lastAmen my lastAmen # # Amen, my amen. # # en. # CC by Aberdeen Captioning .abercap.com
