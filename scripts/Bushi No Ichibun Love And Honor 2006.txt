The magnolias are out. Hot water. You're sighing again. 'Again'? Am I sighing so much? Do you have something on your mind? Your color's not good lately, either. I can't hide anything from you. Well, Kayo... I can't stand this duty I'm on now. The poison tasting? It's nothing but empty form. Complete foolishness. It's pointless. But isn't it an honor to sit before His Lordship... and taste his food? Me, sit before His Lordship? Stupid! A 30-koku samurai, sitting before His Lordship? No? We sit in a dark room off the kitchen, and they bring us the food to taste. We taste it, make sure it's all right. Then they take it way, way over to His Lordship's chamber. That's where he dines. So then His Lordship never sees your face? Of course not! Did you think I looked upon him while I tasted his food? Silly girl! You told me not to ask you about your work in the castle. Now you call me stupid! Stupid!

Rape blossom in tofu. How was it? With all respect to His Lordship, a little bland. It's best for you that way. No ill effects, gentlemen? That one's tiny! Whoops! Careful! Sir! You shouldn't play with children! A samurai walks straight ahead. Those were your late father's words. Oh, shut up, you old fart! Kayo... Yes? What if I were to resign my post? Resign your post and do what? Open a kendo dojo and teach children swordfighting. Why not start one in the garden? I've been thinking. I want to change the way fencing masters teach. Every child is different. I'd like to teach a style suited to each child's character and body shape. The same way kimonos are fitted to different bodies. That's my dream. I can see it now... You teaching swordfighting to little children. But... we wouldn't be able to live as well as we do. I don't mind that one bit. Tokuhei... your grandson could learn swordfighting. The one who won't listen. Could peasants' and townsmen's sons study at your dojo, too? Of course. Caste wouldn't matter. Thank you! Smack him good with your wooden sword. I'm saying that it's not good to teach with the rod. The way he's going now, that kid'll never amount to anything! What an old fool! It's raining. Tokuhei, you get on home. Thank you. What was that you had, Mimura? Red tsubugai sashimi, I believe. Red tsubugai? We don't get to taste that very often! I prefer it cooked in its shell. Ah, over charcoal... No ill effects, gentlemen? Squire Higuchi's getting old. Aye. You may withdraw. Mimura, what's wrong? You're sweating! I'm all right. Call Squire Higuchi! One moment, please! Eat nothing, Milord! The food is poisoned! Get a doctor! Remain as you are! Nobody move! I'll kill any man that moves! Close all gates! No one leaves the castle! Nobody move! Close all gates! By order of the Chief Superintendent! Close the gates! Tokuhei? Yes, ma'am. Why are you so early? Something terrible's happened. The master's been poisoned! Someone tried to poison His Lordship. The castle's in an uproar. And the master? How is he?! I haven't the faintest idea. None of us can set foot inside the place. I asked one samurai about the master and got a kick for my pains. I thought I should tell you, Missus. If you could be ready to come at any time... Excuse me. We have finally concluded our investigation. Suspicions of a plot would have rocked the clan. They have been laid to rest. That, at least, we can say. What the poison taster ate was sashimi from this red tsubugai. Apparently it becomes very toxic if eaten out of season. It causes dizziness, vomiting... severe headache, high fever... and sometimes even death. It is like fugu pufferfish. This shellfish apparently demands great care in preparation. Food poisoning can arise through poor preparation. The Chief Superintendent, however, feels it is not the cook who is at fault. The error was in selecting such a dangerous food... at this time of year. You people may thus return to your homes. There await further instructions. Chief Clerk, may I ask something? What? How is Mimura Shinnojo? Is he alive? He is suffering a high fever, but his pulse is strong. It is the doctor's opinion his life can be saved. Squire Higuchi... I wish to see you in my chamber. The crisis has passed. There's no need to fear. Thank you! Keep up the medicine. I will. You know how? Raise him up and transfer it from your mouth. A bit at a time, so he doesn't gag. Then water. Yes... Soak some cotton and moisten his lips. Don't let them dry out. All right. He should wake up in the next couple of days. Tend to him. Hello? The Hatano Missus! How nice of you to come. How's Shinnojo? - Well... - Where is he? In the back room. Shinnojo? Shinnojo! Oh, dear! Can't he hear me? Look at him! He's so thin! More handsome than ever! Hello, Kayo. You've been having a hard time. I would have come earlier. I had to take my mother for treatments at a spa. What does the doctor say? If we keep up the medicine he's sure to wake up. Who's the doctor? Dr Gensai. Well, if he says so, there's nothing to worry about. Take good care of him, Kayo. You mustn't lose hope. I won't. When he was only this big he was deathly sick for three days. He didn't say a word. Then on the fourth day he was fine. And eating rice-balls, three or four of them! He's got a good constitution. He'll get well. Where are you going? - Tea... - No, no, I have to go. Shinnojo... I'm going now. Get well soon. Do you hear me? The poor thing! That's all right, take it! It'll help pay for medicine. Goodbye. I'll come again, Kayo. Take good care of him. Thank you. Tokuhei? Is that you? You've gotten so old! I was sure you were dead by now. So you're alive, are you? Has she gone yet? My aunt never shuts up. I can't stand her. Even if she did come to see me because I was sick. Tokuhei! The master's woken up! I'm so glad! Sir? Sir? Tokuhei? How long was I out? Today's the third day. I'm so happy you've finally woken up! Wonderful! Isn't that something, Missus? After all your nursing! Are you hungry, Husband? Yes. I'd like to eat something. Tokuhei! We have to make some gruel! Yes. This is no time for tears. Tokuhei... Light the oven. Missus... If there's nothing else, I'll be going. Tokuhei... Something's bothering me. The master's always been rather bashful. He hardly ever meets my eyes when he talks to me. But when I was feeding him the gruel, he was looking straight at me. Just staring at me while he talked. Why? Because you're so beautiful. Don't be silly! No, I mean it... Well... Until tomorrow. The frogs have started singing! Here's your medicine. Be careful, it's hot. You're like me. Your tongue can't take heat. Husband... Could it be that you can't see anything? I didn't want you worried... That's right. All I can tell is if it's light or dark. Why?! Why wouldn't you tell me... a thing like that? We're man and wife! You didn't want me worried? Why would you hold back from me? I want to be worried about you! About anything to do with you! You do? You feel that way about me? I'll call Dr Gensai tomorrow. He'll have something. Don't worry. Soon you'll be able to see again. I'll fix you some more medicine right now. A man trained in the martial arts always has a very strong pulse. If you've come this far, there's no more need to fear. Keep on with the same medicine. Doctor... About my eyes... When will I be able to see again? A high fever like that always has after-effects. Do you know 'night blindness'? Yes. You can't see when it gets dark. Your case is similar. There's no need to worry. Nourishment and rest are the main things. Don't be in a rush. I'll make some more medicine. Come for it later. All right. Well, Squire Mimura... Thank you. That's a relief. Take care. About your husband's eyes... Toxin from that shellfish often causes blindness. My medical books describe his case exactly. Missus... Yes? Further treatment is useless. All that's left is to resign yourself. I'm terribly sorry. Now only the Gods can help you. I guess I'm the one who'll have to tell him. You're awake... I was dreaming about you. Me? You were laughing, with a bird on your hand. I tried to tell you it would fly away, but my voice wouldn't come. That woke me up. Next thing I heard your voice in the dark. It's when I wake up the world goes dark. That's how it is now. Your medicine. It'll help your eyes. The best medicine tastes worst, eh? Yes. Kayo... It's firefly season. Yes. Are they out? No, not yet. No? Did you hear about Mimura? That he's gone blind? What a disaster! How's he going to earn a living? It's not like he can become a masseur or a ballad singer... No. He's not a lucky man. What's that you've... Silence! 'Hundred Prayers' Stone Excuse me... Are you not the wife of Squire Mimura Shinnojo? Yes, sir. I am Shimada Toya. Do you remember me? I often used to see you when I was attending the fencing dojo. Yes! You'd have been on your way home from the temple school. You were renowned as the prettiest girl in the castle town. I understand your husband has met with great misfortune. According to Dr Gensai he will never see the light again. Is this true? Yes. He was doing his duty, but still, it is most unfortunate. You have my deepest sympathies. I'm sure you have concerns about how you will get by. I will help. You are welcome to call on me at my home. Please feel free. Excuse me. Thank you. Missus, I've done a terrible thing! What? While you were out, the master called me. In a very severe tone... he said, 'I'm sure Dr Gensai said something about my eyes. 'Tell me what it is, and you'd better not be lying.' Those blind eyes glared at me. He looked just like his late father. I was so scared I went and told him everything. I'm sorry. All right. Where is the master now? On the veranda listening to the birds, like always. I'm back. I brought you something sweet. Not now. Tokuhei told me. I hid the truth from you about your eyes. I'm sure you're unhappy about that. Forgive me. I knew I'd have to tell you sooner or later. You were thinking of me. It was harder on you than on me. No more, please. Leave me. All right. Leave me alone, please. Tokuhei... Tokuhei... Did you fill the bath? I'm doing that now. I need some shopping done... Tokuhei! Something's wrong with the master. Sir? What is it? Where's my sword? My sword. I put it away in the storehouse. Put it away? You put it away without my telling you to? Tokuhei! Husband! I told him to! Bring it here. I will not! What did you say? Are you disobeying me? Yes. I am. I cannot give you your sword. I will not do it! Sir! You mustn't hit the missus! Kayo! Kayo! I'm right here. I want to die. I'm no use to anyone now. I'm better off dead. That's not so! I'm blind! What does that matter?! It simply means you can't see. You're the same man you always were. No! I'm not. Don't you see? I can't live without help any more! I'll never serve in the castle again. I'll lose my status. I'll be like a beggar, dependent on people for the rest of my life! But I'll be with you! You'll come to despise me. You'll leave me and go off somewhere. What a... What a horrible thing to say! All I ever wanted since your family took me in as an orphan... was to be your wife! How could you say that? I can't even imagine life without you! Die if you want. And by that same sword I will die and follow you. So die... if you're going to! Doesn't anyone have any ideas? Shinnojo's become a man of no use to anyone. How are they going to live? Will someone take them in? Kayo... Yes? What do you think? It's because of you two we've all come here in this heat. We have no intention of troubling any of you. If worse comes to worst, I'll work. You'll work? What will you do? Weaving, or sewing... If that's not enough, I could work as a tavern maid. Don't talk nonsense! A lady connected to our family working as maid?! What an awful thought! I'm sorry! Squire Togo... Don't just sit there! Tell us what you think. He became the way he is in the service of His Lordship. Perhaps they could keep him at even half his stipend... Is there someone you could talk to, Elder Brother? I've been trying to think of someone. Senior Counselor Hattori was a friend of Father's. If he were still living, we could ask a favor of him. But he's been dead three years. All the people connected to him have long since left their posts. Kayo, can you think of anyone in a high position you could ask? We have to take any help we can. Yes. Well, I met Lord Shimada the other day... You mean the Chief Duty Officer, Shimada Toya? Yes. How do you know him? He knew me to see me before I was married. He knew about my husband. He kindly invited me to come and talk to him if I wished. Excellent! Yes. Lord Shimada is young, but very capable. Kayo, take him at his word and ask him for help. This is very important for you and your husband. If he can't work in the castle, his stipend could be taken away. You may have to leave your house. If that happened, where would you live? Will you do it, Kayo? All right. I'll call on him and ask. Oh, good. That's a load off our shoulders! Thank you all for coming. There's nothing fancy, but we have a little something in the next room. That's a nice breeze! Welcome back. All's well? Yes. I'm home. Uncle, Squire Togo, and Aunt Ine all send you their best wishes. What did they say? We talked about how your living was to be taken care of. So now I'm a charity case, dependent on pity? Damn me! You must be hungry. Yes. I'm going to simmer some of the dried taro stems you like. I'll do it right now. Tokuhei... Boil some water. It's hot! Here we are... Are you well, Uncle? I am mortified to be causing my relatives so much concern. In the state I have fallen into, I can do nothing to make it up to you. I ask that you dissociate yourselves from me. Wait, wait, wait! Today I'm here with good news. All right, Shinnojo... This morning I was summoned by the Chief Superintendent. He informed me as to how your case is to be handled. Listen carefully. 'The Mimura family name is maintained. 'His 30-koku stipend of rice is continued. 'Make all efforts for his welfare for the rest of his life.' That's it. In the old days you would've had to leave your house. At most you'd get a 'keep' of This is a very generous decision. As your relative, I am delighted. I came straight here from the castle to tell you, hot as it is. Do you understand what I've said? The news is so much better than I expected... I am astonished. Yes. This must be a great relief, Kayo. Yes. Thank you very much. Go up to the castle soon and express your gratitude. Well, I'll be off. But I haven't offered... No, no. I have to call on the Hatanos and tell my chatterbox of a sister. Here... I have to learn at least to move around the house without help. Yes. What are you doing? Getting your clothes ready for when you go to the castle. Uncle said His Lordship might speak to you personally. It's been a while since I dressed up. Is this my sash? That's my kimono sleeve-cord. I'm not looking forward to going up there. Why not? They'll all stare at the blind man, like I was some kind of criminal. They'll... They'll all ask politely after me, and I'll have to answer. It makes me shudder. Eh, Tokuhei? You knew I was here? I know more or less what you're doing in the house. Tokuhei... If you were thinking of killing me, I'd know. Me? Kill you, sir? I'm joking! What an idiot! Well... No. Tokuhei... Oh, the privy... Missus, it's been a while since we've heard the master joking. Yes. Oh, I forgot... You put my sword away, didn't you. Yes. I'm not going to kill myself. Put it back in the alcove. I will. A warrior's sword is his soul. He must have it with him. That's right. Did that hurt? You do want to kill me. No! It's me, Kagayama. Hori. And Noge. I apologize for the trouble I've caused you all. I'm grateful for your expressions of concern. His Lordship will speak to him. That is an honor. Squire Yamazaki... Do you think His Lordship will know why we're waiting here? I doubt it. He's getting old, after all. Bow down! Here he comes. Well done. Bow down! Tokuhei... Tokuhei! You called? Is Kayo back yet? She's gone to the temple. She should be back soon. Still, she's late. Perhaps she went round by Hyakkencho to do some shopping. Or the Chief Priest found her and wants to chat. That man loves to talk. I hate people like that, men or women. So do I! Especially that Hatano missus... Hello! Is anyone here? Speak of the devil! I suppose I should show her in? Come in! This heat just goes on and on! Oh, no! I'll just step in... Kayo's away? No tea for me. I hurried over. I'm perspiring! Hello, Shinnojo. How have your eyes been? No worse, no better. This is probably how they'll stay. You really can't see? No, I can't. What a shame! And you're still as handsome as ever... Shinsuke! Come here and greet your 'uncle'. Shinsuke? Hello. You've grown! How strong are you? Show me. I can't see any more. He won't study at all! These days you'll never get ahead with the sword. You need learning! The boy just hates to study, Shinnojo! Who does he take after? Your mother, maybe? Yep. Go and play with Tokuhei. Ow! Tokuhei! Have at me! En garde! Shinnojo, I've heard something very strange from my husband. What is it? About Kayo. Should I say? Please. My husband says he saw Kayo in Somekawacho. And she wasn't alone. She was with a gentleman. From the look of his clothes, a samurai of rather high position. Do you know who it might be? When was this? The night of the 6th. My husband and his friends went to a teahouse there that night. Lately he's taken up some disgusting pastimes... Did he see the man's face? That's just it! It was too dark to see his face. Of course, he saw Kayo clearly. Is everything all right, Shinnojo? Are you sure you know what's going on now you can't see any more? All this trouble you've gone to... And just to bring me a nasty rumor. How kind! I've come to tell you something important! Kayo... Kayo is not such a slattern as that! My husband saw her, clear as day, in front of... Enough! You're telling tales on someone. I'm sorry, but that only goes to show how vile a person you are. How awful! I am thinking of my dear nephew. It wasn't easy for me to tell you. And yet you sit there and call me 'vile'? Leave, please. I don't want to see you. Oh, now you can see? Tokuhei, the lady is going. Tokuhei! Leaving already, Missus? I yield! My sword! Come along! There. It's pickled eggplant. Salted this morning. How is it? Hot water. You're not having a second bowl of rice today? Here... There! She's praying to the ancestors, just as she should. The master's seeing sins where there are none! How could he doubt a gentle soul like that? Visiting the grave? Haven't you talked enough, you stupid old monk! How amusing! What's the missus doing here? Welcome. She's here. In your regular room. I'm home. Oh, you're home... Uh, kindling... I'll go cut some. Keep working and listen to me. You followed me today, didn't you. The master told you to, didn't he. You'd never do such a thing if he hadn't. I went into a teahouse in Somekawacho. Did you see that, too? That... was a bad dream. I've known you ever since you were a little girl. You're not like that. That couldn't have happened. What I saw there was not the Missus. It was someone else. That's what I'm going to tell the master. I can't keep it hidden forever. The time has come. There's no help for it. I'll tell the master everything. Tokuhei... I've thought again and again of killing myself. But then I think the master would be left all alone. I couldn't bear that. I've been a fool. If only I'd been strong... None of this... would have happened. Say something! I have my limits. Tell me. Who? Who was he?! Tell me his name. Lord Shimada Toya. Shimada? The Chief Duty Officer? Yes. How? Why? I used to see him when I was going to temple school. When I was a girl. I told Uncle that. He told me to ask Shimada for help having your position maintained. He said it didn't matter if nothing came of it, and insisted I go. I had no choice. I took a gift and went to his house. If I'd told you, I'm sure you wouldn't have allowed it. So I kept quiet. Lord Shimada invited me into a back chamber. He listened very kindly. He said he would help. There's no need to be so formal, Missus. All right. I'll speak to the Senior Retainer about your husband's case. I'll make every effort to see that your request is granted. Thank you very much! However, Missus... Then he said his help would not come for free. Suddenly he seized me... I was terrified. I couldn't cry out. I gave myself to him, thinking then I would kill myself. I only meant it to happen once, of course. But then he sent a message. He threatened to tell you if I didn't agree to see him again. So I met him twice more. I've fallen into Hell. I knew eventually you'd find out and kill me. I'm ready for that. Do as you will with me. A man steals my wife for a measly 30-koku. Rice I was so happy to have. I've sunk lower than any dog. Your eyes are so cold! Don't look at me like that! I'm not seeing you. I can see how you feel. You're cold as ice. Please! Just kill me here and now. The Kayo I knew is dead. You are not Kayo. I did it for you. I'd go through anything for you! Please! Don't look at me like that! Tokuhei, are you here? Yes, sir. I have just divorced Kayo. Get her things together and send her away at once. Sir, please! The sun's already down. No more, Tokuhei. At least he was kind enough not to cut off my head. I'll go. I shouldn't have followed her. She has no family, no home. Where will she go this late? You can't make her leave now! This is my fault... Silence! This concerns the two of us. If you don't like it, then leave too! Tokuhei... goodbye. The missus is leaving! The poor thing! Take good care of the master. You'll be his only support now. Thank you for all you've done. But where will you go?! No, Missus, you mustn't! Watch your feet! 'Wind in Pines'... That's enough, sir. I understand how you feel... Be careful, sir! You'll hurt yourself! Sorry? What was that? A bat... Why can it fly around in the dark? If only I were a bat... Your fencing's got life in it. You've done well to come this far. I've been practicing morning and night with my servant. Shall I partner you, then? If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to spar. You can follow my moves? I can sense a person's presence now. What is it? What's happened? Are you after someone? A samurai? It's a cruel thing to say, but you're blind. You'd be mad to take on a good swordsman in a real duel. Don't do it. I beg to differ. I can sense an opponent's movements. An opponent wouldn't know that. He will be off-guard. Once more, then? Yes. Remember, Mimura, a real fight is different from sparring in a dojo. You never know what a man will do. Keep your sword on mine. I could help, depending on what the circumstances are... Who is he? How did it come about? Forgive me. Honor forbids me from saying. There is one way you can win. That is if you are resolved to die, and the other man wants badly to live. That's the only way. I told you something when I licensed you. Do you remember? 'Be resolved you will both die. 'In that lies victory. 'Life lies in resolve for death.' Sensei! Once more, please. So you cook every day? Yes. Poor guy! It's a fact you can never tell about someone's marriage. Still, to divorce a beautiful missus like that! Aye! Squire Yamazaki, about what I asked you... Oh, that? I found out. It was generous of them... to keep your stipend as it was now you've gone blind. The Council had a meeting. The clan's short of money these days. They decided to give you Counselor Nose took that to His Lordship. You know what, Mimura? The old man thought for a minute. 'If Mimura hadn't tasted that poison,' he said... 'It would have been disaster for me and everyone connected with me.' Right then and there he said you would be maintained for life. He overturned their decision! Did he make that decision based on advice from anyone? No. I'm told those were his words exactly. Counselor Nose himself told me. You can believe it. And here I thought His Lordship was senile! That's our Lordship for you! Aye. And the Chief Duty Officer, Lord Shimada... Did he not say anything in my favor? Shimada? You must be joking! All that gentleman ever thinks of is his own advancement. He wouldn't speak up for anybody below him. Aye. So you relax, take care of yourself, and that's that. Does that put your mind at ease? Thank you for your trouble. Goodbye. Take care. I was hoping to see that beautiful wife of his... Aye. Are you leaving? Tokuhei... Are you here? Tokuhei! You called? Go to Chief Duty Officer Shimada's residence. Deliver this message to him. 'Tomorrow at the midday hour I will be at the old river stable.' Say only that. He will understand. Don't let his retainers hear. Go round the back and speak directly to him. What are you waiting for? Get going! One more thing! Tell him not to underestimate me just because I'm blind. All right? Go on. Go! Who are you? Why must you speak only to me? My name is Tokuhei. I serve Mimura Shinnojo. Mimura? Aye. What does he want? Tomorrow at the midday hour he will be at the old river stable. He bids me tell you that. This is a challenge? I cannot say. But do not underestimate him just because he is blind. What?! That's not from me, sir! My master told me to say so. Varlet! Do you know who I am? I trained for three years at the Naganuma dojo. I am Shimada Toya, licensed in the Shinkage school. Go tell your master this: He is very brave for a blind man. Tell him I'll be sure to be at the river stables. Begone! Sir... I beg of you, please don't fight this duel tomorrow! No more. This touches what I am as a warrior. Shimada deceived Kayo. He lied to her about talking to the Senior Retainer. What he did to the poor woman is tantamount to rape. My very insides boil with rage. But Lord Shimada has a license from a famous dojo in Edo! I know that. Just one blow. With every ounce of rancor in me. I am ready for death. Tokuhei... I give you my thanks now. You have served me since I lost my father as a boy. You've humored me in my selfish ways. I apologize for that. Thank you for all you've done these many years. The river's about 20 yards in front. The stable's just to your left. You can smell it. The floods last winter wrecked it. It's only fit for ghosts now. That's fine. Get well away and hide behind something. Watch your feet. There's stones everywhere... Tokuhei... All the best to you. Go. Mimura... It's me. I'm told you've divorced your wife. Did that not put an end to this? Are you still not content? What you have done to my wife is no less than rape. I cannot in honor let you live. You make much of very little. It is because of that you enjoy your stipend now. You lie! With that lie you deceived Kayo... just to have your way with her. Coward! 'Coward'? How dare you address a superior that way?! You are neither superior nor samurai. I was reluctant to fight a duel with a blind man. But since you speak that way, I will show no mercy. Prepare to die. Damn you! Can you see? My servant told you. Don't underestimate me. What?! Watch your feet. 'Be resolved you will both die. 'Life lies in resolve for death.' Have at me, Shimada. My death... will be yours. Sir! Are you hurt? Where's Shimada? Fallen near you, with his arm cut through. Will you deal the final blow? No. Kayo is avenged. Aye. Tokuhei... Let's go. He was carried home all bloody, his one arm cut right off! The castle was in an uproar. They managed to save his life, and they grilled him about the duel. But he said nothing. That night, with his other arm, he cut open his stomach and died. A samurai can't live with one arm cut off. They're all saying how even he had a warrior's honor. Who was the duel against? That's the point. Who could have cut an arm off a top-ranked Shinkage swordsman? No one knows. There were many with a grudge against the Chief Duty Officer. No one has any idea. They've closed the case. Who do you think it was? You wouldn't know. After all, you can't see a thing. Well, winter's on its way... Tea, sir. This is awful! Anyway, Mimura, I'll drop by again. You've come all the way here just for bad tea... Goodbye. I was meaning to tell you... one of your birds is dead. The one left behind'll be lonely. Tokuhei... Tokuhei! You called? The bird's dead? We'll need a grave. I'll bring a hoe. Sir, I was listening to Squire Yamazaki just now. I'm glad to hear they've closed the case. I was terrified you'd be summoned to the castle. It's a big relief. I was resolved to cut open my stomach the moment I was summoned. That might have been better. What are you saying? You have a long life ahead of you. What's the point in my living a long life? Doing nothing day after day but eating your lousy food... Now you mention it, I've been looking for a girl to cook for you. I think I've found a good one. Do you mind if I hire her? As you wish. Could I bring her today, then? You decide. Don't bother me with it. Sir... dinner's ready. I was wrong. I shouldn't have sent you out to follow Kayo. I wouldn't have sent her away, or cut Shimada down. I was wrong to doubt Kayo. Save the difficult thoughts for later and eat your dinner. Would I have been better off knowing nothing? No. Better off as a fool? That's crazy! Tokuhei... Who made this food? Um... The new kitchen girl I was talking about. Simmered dried taro stems... Tokuhei... Did that girl simmer these? Yes, sir. Where is she? In the kitchen... Bring her here. She's just a scullery maid, sir. I couldn't... Bring her here, I said! I can't do that! Do as I tell you! Yes, sir. Girl... Hot water. I was resigned to never eating your cooking again. I've put up with Tokuhei's awful food all this time. What's wrong? Have you lost your tongue while you've been away? You knew it was me? Stupid! I wouldn't forget your cooking. Then... I may stay? I'm glad you've come home, Kayo. Tokuhei... We'll need a new bird-cage. Aye. And a pair of birds. Aye. Directed by Yoji Yamada
