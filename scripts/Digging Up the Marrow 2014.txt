Like they were my Mickey and Goofy. I'm really into monsters, just as an escape, you know? It gives you something to put your fears on. I was in a mental hospital for a few weeks when I was about 14 or 15. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I didn't know why I was sick. What really helped me escape my reality was these things that I was influenced by as a kid which is watching horror movies and drawing these monsters. I have been a monster, I always will be a monster and after I'm dead I will be a dead monster. Somehow I got to see Frankenstein which I looked at many, many, many, many times, and there was a certain humor to Frankenstein and a certain, er, niceness, er... I always wanted the monster to live. I grew up an only child, so they were my friends. I lived with my imaginary friends. It's what, I think, provided the background for what I do in my acting now. I think a lot of it was just as visceral as really ugly things, really frightening things, holding my attention more than beautiful, pretty things. We like the costumes, we like the character designs, we like the underdogs, the misunderstood, antiheroes, because they explore different parts of humanity that aren't often explored. There're all kind of things that, if we hadn't been introduced to them, we'd call them monsters. There are monsters everywhere. You know what the real monsters are? It's frigging insects. They got claws. They got antennas. They got multiple eyes. They got pincers. And they walk sideways at times. That's a creature. People don't walk sideways. That's stupid. I feel kind of strange, but I think that some monsters could be real. I think monsters exist everywhere where we can't see. I think, behind that chair, just because I can't see it, there is something there. If they did exist, they'd exist somewhere where man doesn't live. They couldn't be out in the open, people would shoot them. You would find them buried deep in the world. Tromaville, which is a very small town in New Jersey. It doesn't matter because if you're terrified of them, they exist. When we do find monsters, if these things do come up from the ground or ascend upon us, like, I just wanna be there to be, "I told you so." My name is Adam Green. As a filmmaker who has had some success in the horror genre, I... Can we just do this with graphics? No, just keep going. I've made movies like Frozen, the Hatchet franchise, er, Spiral. I have a TV series called Holliston. With that comes a very loyal and cult fan base. Stop! I feel like a big enough douche and you keep laughing at me. You get to meet some very unique people... Like, er, people will mail stuff. This Victor Crowley maquette that somebody made. This fan's underwear. This bottle of pills that somebody sent. Really cool stuff like artwork that people will make for us. Um, which is awesome. There was this one guy, er, William Dekker. I wish I had thought to be shooting this the moment this stuff first arrived, er, but... Say it! OK, all right. William Dekker claims, in all seriousness, that he's found monsters. And he wants me to tell his story to the world. Is that good enough? I think we should hire an actor to play you. Dick! I'm so excited, she could explode. I could explode. And I have! I love Holliston. I have a tattoo of Holliston. Tell me what's on your arm. I like Frankenstein. Spiral, Frozen. Yeah, I consider myself to be an Adam Green fan. I have a really cool relationship with my fans, and I think that that's because like, when I was first starting out, y'know, when you're making an independent movie, you don't have marketing or advertisements, so you really gotta do it yourself and put yourself out there, so people know about you and know about your movie and after a while though, like, the more movies you make and the more people there are that want a piece of you, it just kinda starts to, I don't know, I guess, takes its toll. Now, the ones who do get through are the ones who actually take the time to write, like, a physical letter to my fan mail address. And that's huge, you know, when someone's gonna take the time and write you a long letter or send you, I don't know, like drawings, art, fan-fiction, sometimes really personal stuff, I mean, it's awesome. So I... Oh, sorry. Hold on. It's the wife. Hello. Hello. Hey, how are you? Oh, good! Where you at? Er, I'm with Will. - Hi, Will. - Hi, Rileah. Do you know when you're gonna be home? Er, ah, I dunno, five or six. I think, um, we're gonna go sit down with the guy now. Seriously? Oh, you guys are idiots. You guys are idiots! Here we are at the residence of Mr. William Dekker. I'm sorry, Detective William Dekker, the monster hunter guy. I've already come here twice before to sit down with him, and the last time I asked him if he would be cool with us putting him on camera. He didn't say no... Now you people know they're not to talk about this to anybody? Oh, no. That's, like, standard on everything we do. Everybody... I didn't realize there were going to be so many here. Well, you want it to look good, right? I mean, it's gotta be professional. Which, actually, guys, can you just... Here, my... Here, my... OK. And is this eye good, or is... No, you're fine. I... you're sure? 'Cause I... Yeah. Fine. You have enough. About to roll! - All right, we're ready. - Take one. My name is William Dekker. I am a retired police detective. I'm 61 years old and I live in Southern California, er, Chatsworth. I have lived here for the last four years. Erm, now, I know you've already told me this but just for the sake of the cameras, basically, what you're saying is that you've discovered a world underneath our own world where monsters live. Every generation, there are born children who are different, And these 'different children' are given cruel labels like 'monsters', 'freaks', 'rejects'. And these children reach a certain age and they disappear and nobody knows where they go. And what's worse, they don't even care that they vanish. But I do. I do. See, these children, they don't die. They're not even far away from us. They're right next to us. But they exist in their own world. I call it "The Marrow". Some 100 yards beneath the surface of the Earth, exists a metropolis that mirrors ours in very many respects. Life goes on down there, there are marriages, and births, and divorces, and deaths, and friendships, and er... creativity. They can be free. OK, so why don't we, kinda start at the beginning? Let's talk about your childhood. Tell me a little bit about growing up. Well, I was born, um, into, I guess you could say, a lower middle-class family in Nashua, New Hampshire. I was a latchkey kid, I didn't have any brothers and sisters and I, uh, I didn't have any real friends to speak of. So I, er, had to occupy myself. There was a special spot that I always went to. And there was an old lumber company, er, you know, that sold board feet, you know, lumber. And it was all closed down and locked up and the buildings there would by my fortress, be my castle, you know? And I used to, er, I used to defend my fortress against the invading barbarian hoards. I had a hell of an imagination. I bet! You bet. Yeah. Um... It was rather late in the evening, as I remember, and I was late for supper, I knew my mom was... she was going to kill me, so I came running out of the main building where I played primarily, and... And as I came out into the yard I... I saw a man standing by an old wood-pile. As I drew closer to him... Where am I? I'm looking at his face, and it doesn't look human. No, he had a, he had a mouth like a serpent's mouth. It was sort of pointed and it had real thin lips and, er, splayed over the bottom lip was, uh, I swear to God, a forked tongue. And then when he blinked, his eyelids closed from the sides, not horizontally up and down, it was like... I'd never seen anything like that before in my life. It terrified me. Did he say anything to you? No, he didn't say a word. He just looked at me, hard, and then he jumped behind a wood-pile, and I, and I ran around the corner of the wood-pile. He was gone. Just, gone? He just vanished? - He's disappeared. - Here one second, gone the next. Gone, vanished.. So, did you ever tell anybody about it? - Like your mom or your dad... - No... And they wouldn't have believed me anyway, they would've thought I was some kind of a nut, you know? The overactive imagination on wha... on their boy, You know? Probably would've thought I was schizophrenic or something. You know? Yeah. Er... And I felt that way sometimes too. Talking to my imaginary, er, friends in the woods. And I, er, never saw him again, I did see others, though. Oh, yeah... Other, serpent, monster men? Not serpent men, I just saw other, different ones, OK? So, like a variety? I-I never got as close to any of them as I did that first one, but, if I hid in one of the buildings 'till it got dark, and I looked into the woods, I'd see their shapes, moving through the woods. And there were big ones, lumbering. And there were little ones that were darting in and out. I saw their shapes. I saw them. Well, anyway, after about three months, er, I shot some footage there. Oh, you got footage of, of the monsters? No, it was daytime. I couldn't get any footage of them. So what did you get? Well, I found what I believe to be the entrance to their hiding place. The Marrow? The Marrow. So, what do you think? It's not a bad first day, right? No, it was good. It gets more comfortable... Hey! Tell him not to touch that. He's not... those aren't... Those are our cords, it's fine. What do you guys think? Ten minutes to get outta here? It took me 30 years to get all this stuff together. I don't want them messing with it. You do it in ten? Ah, yeah, it's a lot of stuff... A lot of stuff. What I really wanted to ask though is, um.. Wait, wait, wait, what's that behind you? Oh, yeah, what you got in there? Er, it's a storage room. Storage room? Can we see what's inside? - I rather you didn't... - Oh, but... - Dude! - It's a mess! OK, all right! Hey! What the fuck? - Adam? - Yes? - Come here... - Coming. All right, looking good! Thank you. Er, that corn's a little burnt though... No, the corn's fine. - Hey, Will. - Hey, Rileah. Why are you filming? It's a documentary. Adam told me I had to film dinner. So, out of everybody in the world, he picked me. And you're not afraid that this guy's some kind of psycho? No! I mean, not... Not really... I wanna go on record as saying that this might be the worst idea that you guys have ever come up with. Er, I think both of us would agree with that. What if it was real? I mean, haven't you always wished that something like this was real? No! No! Er, unicorns, angels, I don't know, hipster ghosts like Beetlejuice... - Beetlejuice! - Yes... - Really? - Yeah... You want Beetlejuice to be real! Why would I want scary monsters to be real? 'Cause, this guy doesn't think monsters are scary. He thinks monsters are misunderstood. - Yes! Yes, and... - Uh-huh? - And... - Yeah... that's what this guy, Dekker, is all about. - Right. - Seriously, this guy is such a character. When you see the stuff we've already shot with him, you're, you're gonna love him. He's gonna be your new best friend in the world. Like you're gonna be friends with him on Facebook. And... No! No! And, you're gonna follow him on Twitter! - No! - He's gonna be in your favorites! No, definitely not. You're gonna play Xbox with him. What? - I mean, basically... - Ah... This corn is awful. You've burnt it, like... It's fine... How do you even... It's fine, just eat it! The whole thing could be awesome, or it could all be bullshit. - But either way... - I would say it's not. We're not gonna know unless we do it. You know, even if the whole story is bullshit, it's gonna be really funny. How are you even... OK, how are you even gonna finish the next season of your TV show? I'll figure it out. - Mm. - Mm-hmm... This is just a side project. And how does Krishna feel about this? Erm, ah, er... She's OK with it. Uh-huh. She's better than OK with it because she's a supportive wife! Please don't get hurt. I don't wanna have to call your mom and have to tell her that, "Adam got, er, stabbed by some crazy fan because he decided that he was gonna go off into the woods and hang out with him all night long." My mom would understand. - OK. You rolling? - Yep! - OK, so... - I'm rolling. You know... You know what I'd really like to do though? Erm. I mean, I'm ready to go so I think it'd be nice if I got a shot of the car pulling up and you guys getting out and making it look like a movie. The car pu... Why, why do we need the car... 'Cause it's cinematic, it's gonna look nice, you know... It's gonna look cinematic! Come on! Come on! Please, just get in the car and go one more time... Just one more time, please? Christ! All right, so, how far in are we actually going here? There's a cemetery right up ahead. Uh-huh. We go about 100 yards past that... That's the entrance to The Marrow. So nobody minds that you come out here? It's a public place! Right, but the sign at the entrance says that the park closes at dusk. - So? - It's a public place! Cause anything off that main road is closed after sundown. No I, I understand that, but we're literally gonna take some pictures at 'Magic Hour', you know, like dusk, and then we're gonna leave right away, so... OK, as long as you're out of here before it gets dark. Can I ask why it's such a problem if we're here once it's dark? 'Cause the park closes at dusk. OK, but like, specifically, is anything like... Have you, like, personally, ever seen anything... The park closes at dusk! Argh! OK, I get it now. Thank you very much. Has that guy given you trouble before? Yeah! Several occasions he's given me trouble. Oh, watch out. Watch your step. OK. It's right up there. What is the... The entrance to The Marrow. While we're here, you have to do as I say. All right? You listen to me and you do as I say. I've never brought anyone else up here before. And it's crucial that we just observe and not try to interact. Come on! I just, er... I can't... Do you understand what I'm trying to say to you? - I do understand, but I can't... - You understand, Will? - Understood. - All right, Come on... You know... The times that I've been this close, they've discovered that I've found out about them and they've moved on. I don't want that to happen here. So just stay with me and you stay quiet. What did I tell you to be? Quiet! You got it, Will? Got it. Yes, sir. All right. Come on... So now what? Now... We wait. So how many nights are we... Do you come out here and like, hang out in creepy cemeteries by yourself? I try to come out every night. Every night, that's a... That's a lot of nights. Yeah. Well I don't sleep all that much so... Why not? I hear ya. I'm actually, I'm not much of a sleeper myself. When we're in production on the TV show, I'll go, I'll do 20 hour days, 22 hour days... - Yeah... - My wife can't stand it. It's just... I'm like a zombie. Hmm. Well, wives are like that. What's your love life like? You've never mentioned, er, is there a Mrs. Dekker out there? Was there? Er, nope. No Mrs. Dekker. But there used to be. A long time ago, but... So what happened? Just not work out? Irreconcilable differences or... So what about you, Will? What's your story, huh? Huh? I'm married. I've been married sixteen years. Yeah? Yeah. And I have two kids. You know? - You had kids? - I have two boys. Yeah. They're a lot of fun. How old is Cole now? - Cole's 12. - Twelve? Sammy's going to be ten. - Wow. - Twelve and ten. Yeah, they tear my house up. I envy you. They're a lot of fun. I love them Yeah. Some nights, I'll see several of them coming to and from that area right there. Going back and forth in the woods. Other nights I'd see just maybe one. And a whole bunch of nights where there's no activity at all. You just never know, never know what you're going to get. Listen, I mean, if I don't get any lights out here, I'm not going to be able to see anything. You can't see anything? Not really. I mean I can see like three feet in front of me but that's it. What about using night vision? Well... We could use night vision, But I think... I hate it. I think it makes everything just kinda look like green crap. OK, I'd rather it look like... - What? - Quiet! Turn off that light. - Silence! - What? All right. Right straight ahead. Look. Where? You see, Will? No, I can't see shit. Let your eyes adjust for a second then you'll see it. It's right there. Right in front of us. What? There's nothing. Look, look. Look, look. One of them just moving very slowly over to the right. See? Will, turn on the camera light. No, don't! Don't you turn on that light! Listen, if I don't turn the light, I don't have a shot. OK, he's gone. Went back down. He went back down, Will. Look, look! One of them just moving very slowly. Over the to right, see? Will, turn on the camera light. No, don't! Don't you turn on that light! Listen, if I don't turn the light, I don't have a shot. OK, he's gone. Make a great radio show. Did you raise the brightness? - Oh, yeah, I raised it. - All the way? - All the way. - This is as bright as it goes? It's as bright as it goes. There is nothing... - Do it again. - All right. One of them just moving very slowly. Over the right. See? Will, turn on the camera light. No, don't! Don't you turn on that light. Awesome. Good work! I know, tell me about it. Now this one here I call Vance. - Vance. - Vance, yes. You see with the sack over his head, his face painted on it. Why Vance? Because that's what I want to call him. Now Vance here, he never ventured more than a few feet outside the cemetery. But the several occasions that I observed him, I saw him lead some other rejects down into The Marrow. So my guess is old Vance is a... Well, he is a kind of a gatekeeper or guardian, you know, and he guides the new citizens down into their new world, and then he guards against any interlopers, you know. Did you... Did you paint that? - No. - Because that's really good. I had another artist do it for me. I commissioned it. How close is that then to what you saw, would you say? It's pretty close, you know. It's a pretty good representation. Umm... I would say probably on a scale from one to ten, about eight and a half, nine. Yeah. So that's, this is Vance. And why the bag? Over the head, do they all do that? - Do they wear costumes? - No, no... Well some of them wear masks, others, like Vance, wear a bag. - Why is that? - I suppose Vance wears it because what's underneath that bag would be a little too much to take, probably. You know. I... I've never seen it under the bag but... er... I'm sure it's a trip, you know. And then others wear masks to disguise, perhaps, certain deformities. So they could just be all around us at any time then, - is what you're saying. - Well, not any time... No. Er, there are certain times of the year that it's more conducive for them to be around. For instance, Halloween. One of the few times they do fit in. Well, I'm hugely into Halloween myself. Spiritually, that's the time of year when the spiritual world is closest to our world and they're around us and... I don't know... I don't know anything about the spiritual world. But it's... it's kind of like it. No, it's not at all like it. This is not a spiritual world. These people are real. They just happen to be different. - OK? - Yup. - Sorry. - Now, this one... This creature here is a conjoined creature. They're like Siamese twins. They're joined. Right up in here, the upper spine and the torso. And does this one have a name? This one is called, I call it, the Frog and Huck. Frog and Huck? Frog and Huck, yeah. And you painted... The same guy painted this one? No, no, my son... I'm sorry? Wait, wait... you never mentioned a family before... Err.. you notice a longer body... No, no. This is really important, though. I'm curious. You can't see any eyes anywhere on their body... You've never mentioned a family. You see it? I totally see it but I would love to know... about your son. My guess is that they see by a kind of audio sensory sight rather like bats, you know like bat sonar. That kind of thing. Wait! Wait, wait... I'm sorry. What is... You hear that? Are you picking it up? Stay concentrated and focused. Will you, please? I'm totally focused. In fact, I really would love to talk to you a little bit more about the whole use of lights, non-use of lights... That's not up for discussion, all right? No lights ever. Lights scare them away. Do you understand? I explained that to you before. Lights scare them away. No lights! I totally get it. However, though, I mean, all of these, these theories, your stories, photographs, pictures, drawings, it doesn't... It's not going to hold up. Do you not, do you not believe me? That's not what I'm asking. Do you believe? Yes. How about this? I really, really want to believe. How about that? Um, I mean... I want to believe so wicked bad in this... Yeah. That's why I'm here following you and doing... I can tell you my wife thinks I'm crazy for doing this. Do you have any children? Uh... No, not yet. That's not... It's... it's not really the priority right now. We've only been married like three years or so. That explains a lot. OK. Um, how about this? Eventually, we're going to need to have some monsters in our monster documentary. Right? How's the night vision working for you? It's, er... It's pretty good. I mean I can... I can see a lot further. But, I mean it still looks like an old green. It's like a sex tape. Kill it. Hell... Shh. What? You see those two trees? What... What trees... Those two trees straight ahead from us. We're in a forest. There's nothing but... The big tree on the right? There's one right behind it. He's not moving. But it's there. - What, uh... - Don't. Stay still. He might be watching us. He may have seen us already. Look, look, you see him moving? - Huh? - You see him? - No. - Yeah. - Wait, I see something. - Yeah. It kind of looks like a tree branch. OK, dude, do you see anything? Oh, God! He's right here in front of us now! I... I don't see anything. Turn, turn it on. The light. - No, no, no, no, no. - Will, turn it on! If it's here, I wanna see it. - Turn off that light! - Turn on the light! Shut it off! Shut it off! Right. What the hell was that? We're done. What do you mean done? We just saw something. We're done! We're done! All right. So, er, camera's rolling, tell me about what we saw today. Well, basically, my boy, Dekker, finally delivered and we got a... what I can only think is a monster on camera. And it's undeniable. It was there. We have the footage, and I am... psyched, because this is... All right, I will be totally honest, for a brief moment I was starting to think the guy is completely crazy and we've wasted our time, which still could have been funny for something, but, but we saw it, and it was real and it was awesome. Don't you, er... Don't you think it's a little scary, though? Why scary? Why are you going to be such a pussy? It's not scary. Just because something doesn't look like us, or look like everybody else, doesn't mean it's scary. In my whole life, I've only wanted to see a real monster. You know, when I was little, I'd look under my bed, I'd look in the closet, not 'cause I was afraid because I wanted it to be real, you know. I mean, it's just, you know, think about Victor Crowley. You know what? Victor Crowley actually kills people. Victor Crowley is not real. Turn, turn, turn it on. Turn the light. - No, no, no, no, no. - Will, turn it on! If it's here, I wanna see it. - Turn off that light! - Turn on the light! Stop it, stop it. If that's a make-up job, it's a damn good make-up job. That's all I'm saying, right? Well... - Right? - I'm just going off the footage. Because I wasn't there. But my gut is telling me that you guys are messing with me. We're not messing with you. I tell your gut to shut up. How about that? You believe this. You're a believer. You believe in William Dekker. Yes, well, OK... how about this. I don't necessarily believe him but I believe this, yes. I've always wanted to believe this. Haven't you always wanted... Look at you... you have a whole sleeve of horror stuff and you're not more excited by this? Haven't you always wanted this to be real? I mean, I don't know about this, like aliens maybe. Aliens, aliens, who cares about aliens? This is monsters... this is monsters. What if... What if this guy's conspiracy theories are all true, right, and he came to us with this and we're the ones who are getting it. Right, then maybe we'll make some of our money back for filming this. It's always money with you. Why is it always about money? I was just saying... Whoa! Oh, that's Kane. - Hey! - Hey, boys. - How are you? - Hi, Kane. - Good. - Thank you for coming over. What's with the camera? - Err... we're just... - It's part of a thing. Yeah, we're just doing a thing... Thank you for coming so late. - Sure. - First, first you have - to see this, OK? - All right. What are you showing me? Wait, wait. We've been shooting this documentary, OK? - This guy contacted me. - Documentary? Yes, it's a documentary and... Very fancy. If you think that's fancy, you should see all the make-up he had on in the interviews. I did... It's a formal sit-down interview. You have some make-up on. OK, will you just play this for us? Just watch this, watch this, watch this. Play the tape. I... I don't see anything. Turn, turn, turn it on. Turn the light. - No, no, no, no, no. - Will, turn it on! If it's here, I wanna see it. - Turn off that light! - Turn on the light! Shut it off... So what am I looking at? What are you look at? The monster, did you not just see that? No, I mean what's it for? It's not for anything, it's... Play it again, play it again. Watch closely. Look at this. Really look at it. Go, go, go. - Turn off that light! - Turn on the light! Shut it off... It does look pretty cool, but you can't really see it that well. - Well, it's the... - Who made it? Nobody made it. That's the whole point. - It's real. - We actually shot this in a cemetery up in Chatsworth. - Yes. - And it wasn't porn? Chatsworth is the mecca of porn. I know that, yes... I'd like to see that part again. There's no more than this. I give... if anybody should be excited by this, it's you. If anyone knows monsters, it's you. Look at that, look at the neck. The thin neck, the huge head, how could you even do that as an appliance on somebody? - Want my real opinion? - Yes. - It looks really good. - Thank you. I mean, no, not thank you because it's not... We didn't do it. It looks really good but it's... you need to light it better, - it's terrible, Will. - Oh, come on! It wasn't lit. That's the whole point. - Yes, it's exactly right. - No, it's actual footage. Actual footage. Found footage. Boy, that hasn't been done before. - No, no, no, no. - That's what I was trying... Will you shut up? No, it's not found footage. It's footage footage. - Damn! - No, it's... I'm so let down right now. Well, what else you got to look at, then? We have tons, we have so much. We've actually got nothing else. What you did... could have destroyed decades of work. Have you been back to our spot since? OK, and... Yes, I have and thank God they haven't gone yet. But they're moving around with a lot more caution. They probably chalked up our little incident to a random sighting and they don't fear for their discovery or that their entrance is in jeopardy in any way. OK, all right, but... Um, I totally hear. I want this to work so badly. I really do. But, by the same token, you brought us into this to shoot stuff. OK? And if we can't shoot stuff, then there's no story, right? There's nothing. So, help me here. Yeah, yeah.. Well, that's why I've brought you over here today. Is there any way that we can shoot and not be so completely intrusive? Yes, er... Will and I have been talking about that a lot. Err... Will, why don't you tell Mr. Dekker our plan? - Good. - Me? - Yeah. - Do it. Um, OK. Well, er... Here's what we talked about. Um, so we set up a fake street light, if you will, out there. A light that's just, maybe could play for a street light. We turn it on during the day. We do all this during the day, so no one is disturbed. We set up a street light out there, turn it on and leave it on. - This is on. - On all the time. Then we take some small cameras and we rig them to the trees. We have a few cameras in the office... They're so small like you wouldn't even... - They're real tiny cameras. - So small. And we rig them to the trees and just let them roll. Let them roll. Nobody goes out there, starts and stops them. Nothing. No lights on the cameras? Nope, there's no lights on the cameras. How bright is that light that you already have on? - It's not... - It's not... It's not bright. It's soft. Yeah, on a scale of one to ten, it's really soft. And nobody turns it on. It's already on. Nobody is going to disturb anybody With this, with what we want to do. - No. - No. - OK. So... We got... - Shh! - We got five cameras now. - Yeah. Pointing here for now, they're pointed there, at the cemetery, and, if you look up there, we'll hang that street light looking thing. It looks almost identical to the ones they have hanging in the front of this place, so completely unobtrusive, but now we have light. Now we can see things. If that cemetery light makes them suspicious? It won't. Honestly, I'd be more worried making that Park Ranger dude suspicious, but hopefully, he thinks that, you know, like maintenance came out and replaced it or something. I don't know. But I'm... honestly, I am kind of surprised that you haven't thought of this before. I have. It didn't work. Fantastic. Actually, I think it would be better if we didn't have the music while we're actually recording the interview because the music makes it hard to edit with. It's my favorite tune. Who, who is this? I don't know. During my decades of research, I've... I have discovered over 40 different species going to and from The Marrow, and that's just from the half dozen or so entrances that I have found. Half dozen or so... Uh-huh. Now are they always out in the woods or near a creepy cemetery? Sometimes in the woods, sometimes in the cemetery and sometimes in other places. The eye hop. Eye hop? Um, why would they have a Marrow entrance where there's an eye hop? They like pancakes. Pancakes? Everybody loves pancakes. Pancakes. Of course. Anyway, that one er, entrance in Arizona I couldn't really identify. I mean I monitored the situation for several months but I couldn't pinpoint where the entrance was. However, the entrance here, in Southern California, is the most defined entrance I've ever seen. I don't want to lose it. Because if you give them enough reason down there to suspect that they've been discovered, then they'll just move on. I don't know if they move underground from one metropolis to another but you'll find the entrance sealed like there was nothing ever there. And I would like to think that the metropolises underneath are connected in some way, you know. Like all the different areas as... 'Cause I mean I'm looking at that map and this... It's all over the country. And so you feel that they're all connected underground? I think that's quite possible. Yes, but I don't have any hard evidence, of course, to substantiate that, so... Most of the subjects are painfully shy. Painfully shy. In fact, one that I had observed in Salem, Massachusetts, that I called Brella... Brella? Brella, short for umbrella. There she is, right there. You notice here the umbrella covers up her head entirely, - as you can't see her face. - Yup. But she does have the body of a normal human female, and a very attractive one I might say, you know. In fact, I saw her interacting with a human. Interacting, how? Like a human saw... saw that? I saw Brella in Salem, Massachusetts, pick up a drunk college boy outside of a bar. - Wait... Do you mean? - In an alley... Pick up like 'flirted with', like 'took him home', like... What do you mean by picked up? What does 'pick up' mean to you? Well, that's... That's what it means but I have... Well, then, that's what I mean. OK, but I would imagine... She picked him up for some sort of sexual escapade, OK? OK, now if I got picked up... They walked away, they disappeared, I tried to follow them... Why wouldn't he say something to somebody though if he... Why... Why... What is wrong with you? Why can't I ever just tell you something and you listen? 'Cause I wanna cut through it. I mean, again, it's another painting. You don't have a picture, you don't photograph. Now you're telling me somebody... I'm telling you what she did. She picked up this drunk college boy. She went off with him. I don't know what happened. I tried to follow them, I lost them. That's it. So then, then what? What happened? Then... after about three weeks, a body washed up by a river in Danvers... Oh. The body of the boy? Well... Nobody really knew... I mean, there wasn't much there to be able to identify. All his entire jaw was gone And no dentition... The hands were gone, the feet were gone. Just a lump of flesh... Not very identifiable. Now the case is still open, you know, it's unsolved but, I bet my pants it was that boy. In every society, there are other deviants. The bad seeds, you know. The ones who are pure evil. You're saying that something from The Marrow killed somebody and these things are dangerous. Not all of them. But some of them. Perhaps. Er... I think we're good. For today. Can we stop? - Yes. - Yeah, it's a cut. Forget the fact this guy is just a complete psycho which is a given. But now he's showing us these like images of these things that may or may not exist, right? And now he's says they're killing people. I don't understand what we're doing. Yeah, I mean you... you were there. You saw it. You can't deny what we saw. Well, I mean I can't say that I saw a real monster. Look at the movies we've done, right. Like think about that. All the make-up effects that we put on the screen, the visual effects... Wait, wait, wait, wait. After all the movies we've done, you mean to tell me that you can't tell the difference between full latex or silicon and what we actually saw right in front of us. I'm just saying it's possible, you know. That's all. It's possible what? That there's monsters? No! That this guy's a total freakazoid! Guys... Listen... I mean... I'm not actually working on this whole monster project, but what I am working on is a little show called Holliston. Um, I am a little concerned, Adam, do you have any scripts? They're almost ready... I uh... they're gonna be done... But we start production in like two months. And I will get it done. I don't want to just, you know, I don't want to say "'Stop what you're doing and write Holliston" but I really need you to stop what you're doing and write Holliston. OK. If... I swear to God, if you had been there and you saw this, you'd be just as fire up as we are and you would be like, "OK, the other stuff can wait." And you don't think it's dangerous. You don't think you could get hurt. Listen, it was fun when it started. You know running around the woods chasing the psycho guy around. It was fun. But now, Sarah's telling us we're putting the show on hold, which means we're putting our careers on hold, and, I mean, I talked to Krishna about it. She's not really happy about this whole thing. Oh, no. You know, not to be a dick but I don't care what your wife thinks. Why doesn't she write the next season of the show? - It'll probably be better. - Adam, stop. Stop it. All I am saying is that an amazing opportunity just dropped right into our laps and now you're saying you want to quit. No, no, no no. I'm not saying that I want to quit. I'm just saying that we need to control it better. We need to get done what we need to get done. Not quit. Adam, like honestly, do you 100 percent believe this guy and his whole monster thing? I... Ninety percent. I 90 percent believe. Well, 90 percent. That's a lot of percent. All right, that's number five... Uh, wait... I'm sorry. Could you please wait? Because we need to shoot you when you analyze the footage. So just wait till we get back, please. So, you're sure that camera two is in this tree? Yeah, I'm sure. And we have one, three, four and five. Definitely, two. Uh, maybe it fell out? No. Uh, what about you, Mr. Dekker? See anything over there? No, I don't see a thing. Nothing. Well, looks like we lost camera two. Come on. We got to get out of here. I will pay you back. I got something. - Huh? - Adam, come here. Now look, look! Will... Come here, come here, come here! - Oh, look. - Dude, dude! Come here, come here, come here! See... didn't I tell you? That is awesome. I've never seen one like that before. - Really? - No... New species. You want to name it? Me? No! You do it. It's... That's your thing. All right, all right. I'm gonna call them Little Big Foot. Little, Little Big Foot, really? He looks like a Big Foot, doesn't he? Yeah, I mean if Big Foot was a real thing and if anyone had seen it. What about, what about something more original? You know what about, um, Deringer. So you wanna name it? No... You... You... All right, then. Little Big Foot. New species. You don't like Deringer? OK, stop it, stop it. OK, so that was, what, four hours. - Four hours - Four hours, and then, whatever that thing is, crawls out of the hole and walks away. So you honestly want to try tell me that Dekker had some dude just wait underground for four hours only to get up and walk away for our cameras. You got me. You got me. Ha! Three, two, one. We've now cut our second monster on camera, and Mr. Dekker seems to think that it's a new kind of species which is all kind of... - Stay. - What? Come to bed. I'm going to in a second. I just... I have to do my recording about the second monster or else it's going to drive me nuts. Then I'll be talking about monsters all night. You're cute. Seriously, though, you need to sleep. I'm going to. In three, two, one... So look at that... I mean the teeth, the eye... it's amazing, right? Yeah, very nice. Who does your creature work? OK, that's the best part. Nobody. It's real. This is real footage that we got. There was this guy who... he wrote me a letter through my fan mail and he had this whole theory that, like, you know when people were born deformed or whatever, like where do they go? You know, you don't just see them walking around, I mean, unless you had a horror convention like this. But, it's, you know... he says that they've all retreated underground and that's where they live. So, we've been making this documentary following him... Whoa... Hold it. You're reminding me of the psycho of a guy, he has a name like Davis Darren? - Dekker? - That's it. Er, Mick, Mick, would you come over here for a second? Adam, Hey, Mick, how are you? Good to see you. Adam is working with Dekker, the monster hunter. Oh, no. No, I'm not. I wouldn't say I'm working with him. You? He's harassing you, now? Well, no. We... I talked to him once about something. "I found The Marrow." That guy? Please. He's been after me, and Tom, and Carpenter and Guillermo, Landis... Every horror director in the business he's been bothering. He's antagonized everybody for years. Trying to get us to buy the movie rights to his stupid story. He's a real basket case. Err... Yeah. No. Totally, I just... Grasshopper here has been working with him, I can tell... No, no, I wouldn't say "working with him". - What are you, stupid? - No! I'm sorry, that was rude. - But are you? - Uh, I guess sort of, I guess... Anyway, your creature work is great regardless of who's doing it. - How's your next movie coming? - Uh, which one? I don't know. It's what you say. I'm trying to be nice. Good luck, guy. Good luck. Have a good signing. And whatever you're shooting, I'm not signing the release. Thank you. All right, so, er... Are we going to talk about it? He said, right up front, that he's tried numerous ways to get this story out there. OK? So... Yeah, it was embarrassing that I didn't know that he had already been to everybody else. OK, like what am I... Is that what you want? Is that what you want me to say, "I am embarrassed"? - that I feel stupid? - No. But, look, when we get back, the next time we talk to him, I'll ask him, point blank, who else have you brought this story to? And, you know, let's see what he says. Yeah, we'll see. You think he's going to be truthful about that? So, one thing that I've been meaning to ask you is why reach out to a genre filmmaker with this? Why go to somebody like me who does what I do? Well, heck, I tried the authorities, I tried the press, I was even on a couple of talk shows. Nobody wanted to hear it. They all treat me like I was a nut, you know? So, I thought, you know, a filmmaker who had a built-in audience... and who can capture and tell the story... convincingly and properly... Properly. That would be the way to go, you know? OK, then why not got to somebody bigger, like an even more established, you know, why... Why me? You work outside the machine. I like that. So, you never reached out to somebody else before me? Never went to anybody, that is was straight to me? Nope. Just you. Just me. So, there were a couple of interesting things that happened when you guys were gone. I think you're going to like this. So, it'll start on camera four here. We're looking right at The Marrow and here comes Dekker, 1:30 in the morning with a bag and flashlight. All right. This is where it gets really weird. He walks over to camera three... looks right at it... and turns it off. Why would he shut...? I don't know. Goes over to camera one. Again, right at it... - And he shut... - Turns it off. All right, what I want to know though is if he shuts off all the cameras, like what is he not... Does he think we're not gonna see that in the footage? He doesn't turn off camera four. So he either doesn't know how to work the cameras, he doesn't know how many are up there... whatever. He's back at the hole signaling something, it looks like... and if we get in close, he starts pulling something out of the bag, and I don't know what's in the bag. Maybe you guys can help me out. What is that? Just an old man talking to a hole in the ground. No, well, what's in his hand? - I know what that is... - What? It's a... it's a spoon. So, what is he doing? He's taking dirt? Was he taking samples out of the...? I mean, he's like... he's digging down there. And then he puts it in his bag? No, no, no, he's taking something out of... What's he feeding, feeding one of them? I can't see... I can't see in. There's no definition. Such low light sensors that... He's feeding something... or he thinks he's feeding something. OK, then, what else? What else? I mean, after that, fast forward a little bit, he packs up his stuff, stands up... Uh huh. Walks back over... Turns the cameras on again. Yup, camera one comes on. Sets it up, clear as day... He has to know we're going to see that. So, is this... Here's a question, Is this on purpose? Did he want us to see that? 'Cause I'm... I'm kind of... and then he's waving and signaling again. OK, awesome. What else? Anything else? This one is a little weird. Um, the very next night, - Mm-hm. - Four o'clock in the morning, - camera one... - Yeah? I'll zoom in so you can see. Here he is sitting on the edge of The Marrow. He's like... And I have no idea what he's doing but he's sitting here for about a minute and a half, 2 minutes. He's touching something in there. What, is he petting one of them? I don't think is petting them. What is it? Oh my God, wait... He's crying. He's crying. I didn't know what to make of it. He's like sobbing. I mean, the only other thing I'm doing is catching up on cemetery footage, just hours of cemetery footage. This guy, it's like he's sick. You know, like, he chooses the weirdest things to lie about. Isn't the lying just enough to stop this whole thing? No, it's not. Why do you have to keep saying that we need to stop it? It's not enough. I don't care about him lying to me. That's irrelevant. Did you tell Josh about the other night? - What happened the other night? - Nothing happened the other... It turns out that this Dekker guy has gone to every single Hollywood director with the story. Who else did he go to? It doesn't matter. It... That's semantics. What matters isn't him, OK, it's 'it'. It's where he can take us because... And I know I sound crazy to everybody but my whole life since I was a little kid I had prayed for this to happen to me. I have prayed for this to be real, and now I have seen it... and for better or for worse, this lunatic is the guy who can bring me to it. And, OK, I know you guys are going to say I'm trying I swear to God I'm not but this is just the theory I have. I think that this is some sort of psychosis, like this whole thing. I think that, like, his kid died or something. And this is why... When we were in the cemetery and you mentioned your kids, he was all over you about your kids, right? That's right. And then when we were doing one of our interviews with him he was showing me paintings of the monsters. And I asked him about them, "Oh, who painted that?" - And he said, uh... - He said my son. Thank you. Yes. - And then, when I try... - "Oh wait, son?" "Oh no", he didn't want to go there anymore. Now he's feeding something in a hole, something that's probably not there. Maybe he's imagining it, or... This is where it gets a little weird. Maybe he thinks his kid is down there. His kid is one of them. Oh, boy. OK, I know... it's crazy. But if we could just find one person, one person to vouch for him, a family member, a neighbor, just somebody who actually knows this guy in real life, not the life that he's presenting to us, I'd feel so much better because then I would know is he crazy? Is he mentally ill? Is it all a hoax? And I'm just a sucker. You know, but you like you Google him and he has no digital imprint on the internet whatsoever. There's literally nothing about... What? Boston. He was a police... He was a police detective. So, what? No, the original package that he sent me, the original letter, it says he was a former Boston police detective. We can go talk to them. We're not going to Boston. We're going to Boston. Awesome. No, we're going to Boston. Awesome. Right now we're going to Boston because I spoke to a guy at the Boston police department but they wouldn't answer any of my questions over the phone but the guy did say he would give us, like, 15 minutes. So, what I want to do is, I want to sit down, I want to find out more about when Dekker worked there, like, maybe there's people there who still know him, and like especially if he's talked about The Marrow and all this stuff before. I think we're to get some really... some cool stuff. Great. - I don't know. - It seems like a waste of time to me. OK, well, you know what? If nothing else, we get to go home to Boston. When was the last time you got to go to Boston? What, like three years ago, four years ago? No, I was in Boston two weeks ago shooting a cable ad. Well, you don't have to shoot a cable ad while you're there so, um... it'll be fun. I've been with the Boston Police Department now for 24 years and I don't ever recall working with this gentleman. No. What department did he say he worked with? Uh... he didn't specify that. Well, I suggest you have him contact us and as you can understand, I can't get into the service records of a former police officer with a third party. No, I, I understand that totally. I just... I guess, to clarify that, now, what you're saying is that, to the best of your knowledge, a William Dekker has never worked here at the Boston Police Department? That I know of? No. Just because the one guy we talked to didn't know him doesn't mean that it's a lie. I mean you heard what the officer said. Even if he did know something, he's not allowed to tell us anyway... so... worked there. I mean... clearly the guy never worked there. You don't know that. That's according to one officer. When we get home, let's go back out there to the spot but just me and you. No Dekker, so that way if this is like a hoax, he's putting stuff on for us. He wouldn't even know that we're there. Just us. Right. Just so we can freak out again and tell us how much we are compromising his work and then quit. Not if he doesn't know. Is this it? Yeah... I know where we are. Just park here. OK, cool. All right, let's do a quick in and out, OK? I don't want to be here all night. No, I just want to see the spot without him here. That's all. Wait, wait. How do you... Just twist the dial on the side - Like that? - Yup, that's it. OK, all right. Got it. All right. Let's wait, wait. Shh. What, what? Do you hear that? Was that your footsteps? No, I stopped. - Right, let's do it... - Great. It's frigging hot tonight. Yeah. It's wicked, flack and... - Whoa, whoa, whoa... - You good, you good? Yeah, yeah, yeah trees. Well, I told you no more uh... no more ski-lifts at night, right? So, this isn't that bad. This is like home. It's the woods. You know what's funny though? - What? - Is that during the day it's like, 'Oh, I am in the forest.' But then at night, it's like "I am in the forest" it's really scary. All right. And there it is... OK, so... all right. Let me do my intro. OK. All right, am I all sweaty? Um, a little shiny, not too bad - All right. OK. - Hold on. OK? - Into camera, right? - Yup. Here we are at the entrance to The Marrow, or at least what Dekker claims to be the entrance to The Marrow. No. OK, hold on... Oh, my God... I thought that was you. Do you smell that? You realize we're in a cemetery, right? And uh... there's dead bodies all around us. Um... I've stuck... I've stuck my head in worse I actually went to Hopster for four years so... All right, hold on. - OK. - Wait a minute. You realize we're in a cemetery and you're sticking your head in a hole? I know that, I know that... but I got to see. Hello? Monsters? Yani? Yeah. Dude. OK, here's one thing I will say, though, is... I don't know if you can see it but when you go down it curves around Oh my God. Dude. It's got me! It's got me! Nothing? Really? No, Jackass. Come on. Can we get out of here? You're no fun. All right, well, good. I'm glad we did that. Now we know we have lots of footage of a crazy guy who should probably be committed, rambling around about nothing. We have a hole in the ground over here. We have lots of old gravestones, and we have a dude, who was probably one of Dekker's friends who jumped out at us wearing nothing but a Halloween mask which is... whoa... Dude... Sorry... Oh! Seriously, seriously help me out please, please, please! I'm not joking, I'm not joking! Someone took my boot. He grabbed me. Well, at least you still have your foot. No, I'm serious, something, something... It took my boot. You mean like a root or something? No, something like it didn't hurt... but it took my boot off of my foot. Bullshit. Fine. You know what? Here. Hey, uh dude, can you do me a favor really quick and just reach in that hole and um... - Aha, yeah. - And grab my boot for me, please? You want me to get your boot? Yeah, yeah... come on... do it. There's nothing in there. - All right, all right... - Do it. It's pretty deep. It's a... You know what? No, it's your boot. You get it. Oh, oh, OK, yeah. Here you go. You know what? Um... I was going to throw these boots out when I got home tonight anyway because they're old and they smell. So I don't even need it. And you're going to walk home in your sock? I'm going to walk home in my sock. But what about the snakes? There's no snakes. What about the spiders? Oh! Spider! What, dude? Oh, you're such a dick. - Fine. - Go get your boot. I'll get my boot. If something happens to me, seriously... Damn it! And don't do that thing where something grabs you again. I would never do the same gag twice. Have you seen Hatchet 2? Go on. Just give me a second. Holy shit! OK. - Go on... - I'm going, I'm going. I can't reach it. I can't reach it. Wait, wait, wait. OK, hold on. Oh, shit! Whoa... Hah!... Got it! What the hell are you two doing? Oh, shit. What have you done? What have you done? Nothing, we were just getting some shots without you out here... potentially orchestrating this shit. What do you mean by orchestrating? I can hear you half a mile down the goddamn road. You have no right to come up here. No... but there, there, honestly something down there just totally took my boot. I told you we needed to be discrete. I warned you. We could scare them away. I warned you some of them are danger... Public place. We have every right to be here if we want to. - Both of you, that was stupid. - It's not stupid. Don't film this now. No, I'm not recording. - You know what was stupid? - You're not? No. Listen to me. What was stupid? Was the other day when we took you out to coffee and I asked you point blank have you said this shtick to anybody else. And what did you say? I said that I took it to a multitude of places before I brought it to you. No. No, no, no, no, no... I asked you point blank. Didn't I? I asked him point blank, I said "Have you said this to other directors in Hollywood?" And you said, "No, just you". "Just you". Just me, that's what you said. And it's not adding up at this point. It's never going to add up. If they move away because of your meddling - Our meddling? - Yes, your meddling. No, we're trying to tell a story here because, you know what, like what if, what if it was real? I want to believe in it. He wants to believe in it. And I've sunk a lot of my time, and a lot of his money into this so far, and honestly, it feels like Linus waiting for the great pumpkin to arrive or something. - No... - For all we know, this is just a bunch of your buddies running around in Halloween costumes for our cameras. Well, maybe I don't need the two of you involved in this anymore, all right? But let's take this conversation over to the road so we don't make the situation any worse than it is. No. We're not taking one more step until you admit that you've been lying. About? About... what haven't you lied about? About everything. Monsters, The Marrow, your name. I don't even know who you really are. My personal life is my business. Do you understand? It's my business. We have been upfront with you since day one. You know exactly who we are... - Get down... - What the hell was that? I don't know what it was but it brushed against my feet. It went over there. They're watching us. What was that? Guys? Come back... come back... Did you get it? Yeah, I got it. I got it. It came right at me. Will, Will... come on... - I'm coming, I'm coming - Let's go. Give me one second. I want to see it, I want to see it. Come on man, let's go, we gotta go now. They're coming, they're coming. I'm coming... - Come on, Adam. - Shut off those lights. Shut it off. Come on, go... What is that? What? Drive around it, drive around it. What the hell? It's got him! It's got him! Let go! Let go! Drive, drive, drive, drive drive! Has that ever happened before? No, never to that extent. I mean, I've been followed once. I been chased a couple of times but an outright attack like that... You see what you've done! What I've done? OK, hold the phone here. First of all, you have not been straight with us since day one. OK, starting with the fact that you never worked for the Boston Police Department. What? - You never... - Yes, I did! We went and met with them and they never even heard of you. I was a private detective. Private, you, imbecile. Don't' you understand English, huh? Do you speak English? I understand it enough to know that you would at least have been affiliated with their division in one way or another. But no, they've never even heard of you. You know, I trusted you Adam. I brought you into one of the greatest discoveries of all ti... - Don't point your finger at me. - ...you go and screw me! - I'm not... - Why are you screwing me? Because I don't know if it's bullshit or not! Why couldn't you listen to me? Because I didn't want to spend five more months running around, looking at sketches, and looking at drawings, and listening to your psycho babble. Well, listen to you, man. You sound like all those other assholes. You're too blind to see what's going on around you. Oh, I saw, I saw something today. I don't know what it was. Do you know what it was, Will? - No. - So, what was it? Back me up here. For once, back me up! I'm going to go, I'm going to go inside. Yeah, OK, you... No, no, no, no... They know we found out about them, Adam. They know we found them. They're going to move. They're going to close up that entrance. And I'm going to lose him, and I'm not going to lose him. Who? Who's "him"? This is my last chance and I'm not going to blow it. Who is "him"? Just tell me the truth about one single thing. OK, how about this, Mr. Dekker? If that's even your name. What about the fact that you went to every director in Hollywood before you came to us with this project, right? What... well... I was like the absolute last choice, and I asked you point blank, when we had coffee, and you lied to me - about that too! - Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. OK, it's 1:30 in the morning. I think the best thing to do right now, we were just attacked, let's call the police. How about that? - No! - Call... No police, no police. No police, if they've moved, then I'll dig. I'll dig down. That tunnel's still there, I'll dig. Then you can call anybody you want. You call the whole goddamn world, I don't care. Just get out of here. Now go on. Do we even have lights in the car if we go down there? I got to plan this. I got to plan it. Well... I... Get out! Go on, get out! If you're going down there I'm going with you and I'm seeing this through. We need lights from the office... - Adam! - We need two more cameras. Listen, listen to me for a second. I'll meet with you here at sunrise, you and Will. All right? Sunrise. Then you can shoot any goddamn thing you want. You can shoot as much as you want, all right, I don't care. Shoot whatever you want. OK. Sunrise here. We've two cameras at the office... Now go, please. You're coming with me. I got to work. I got to plan this. Don't puss out on me on this. Get out... Get out! - I'm going to get out... - Get out, Will! Where do we meet you exactly? Here, here! At sunrise. Right here at sunrise. - Right here at sunrise. - We will be back... Get out of here, goddamn it! I can't think! Maybe we should just go. I find it hard to believe he overslept. Mr. Dekker. Oh, wait a minute... Hold on. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hello. Hello. Sorry. I'm trying to reach the guy that lives there, your neighbor. No one lives there. No, no the guy, uh... the old guy, William Dekker. The guy lives there. No one lives there. That place has been empty for a year. OK, I am sorry, I'm sorry... - So... - What? According to Dekker's neighbor, this place has been empty for a year. Wait, so nobody lives here? No-one is supposed to live here. - No, no, no... - Oh, what do you know. - No, no... - Come on, come one. Mr. Dekker? Are you kidding me? What, he just skipped town? - What? - Look, look, look. Oh, man... You know what? No, we should... We should just go. We shouldn't do this. No, no, come here, come here. Man... Urgh. Urgh... Is that shit? - Urgh. - What he... It smells so bad. What the... What did he have? Urgh... can we go? Yeah, did you get all this? - Did you see all this? - Oh man, let's go. - Please, can we just go? - OK, OK, OK. Dude, where we going? Where do you think? We're going after him. Oh, hell, no. I'm not going down that hole. We're not going in the hole. - Will you just come with me? - No, We're not going back there! Just get into the car. Trust me. Come on... Seriously, can we please just call the police? Mr. Dekker? Oh... No, no, no, no, no... OK. Our final recording... in three, two... So, it's been a little over a month since we last heard from... Dekker and I've tried calling, but like his number just rings and about two weeks ago, it switched over to one of those "This number has been disconnected" messages. But, last week... our missing camera, camera two... was delivered to me... and, er... My name is... My name is William Dekker. If you're seeing this, I need you to understand that I was wrong. There's no such thing as "severo". There are no monsters. Don't follow me. Don't believe my work. Stay away! There's no such thing as monsters. Monsters are not real. Monsters are not real. Monsters are not real!
