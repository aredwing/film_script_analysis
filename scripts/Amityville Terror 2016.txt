Mommy, please. Faith? No! Faith! Faith! No! THE AMITYVILLE TERROR I'm like 100% sure we passed this road already. Are you sure you're not lost? No, I know where I'm going. Feels like we're in the middle of nowhere. That's because we are in the middle of nowhere, Hailey. Even if we were in the middle of nowhere, which we're not by the way, we're in it together, and that's what counts. Dad. Well I for one like the sentiment. It's a big move, but we are in it together. Well yeah, just us and Shae. Hey, your aunt Shae needs us right now. You never know. You might like living with her. Yeah, reformed addicts are the best. Hailey. Listen, I know this is hard, but it's not forever. When the time is right, we'll get our own place, I promise. Great, no service. I am in hell. Give you some perspective. Really, because from my perspective, I see trees. Look, another tree. Look another tree. Toddy Bear! I missed you. I missed you too. You look great! Thanks, so do you. You look amazing. Thank you. Hi Jess. Hi. You made it, I'm so happy. Hi Hailey. How's it goin'? You wearin' your dad's clothes now? That's awesome. Welcome to the not-so-big city, guys. Also known as the smallest town ever. Yeah, we're quite far, far away from pretty much anything. Yeah, at night you're gonna love it. It's super zen underneath the stars with the crickets. I hate crickets. Who hates crickets? I do? Come on, let's go, I wanna show you inside the house. How many times do you think she says zen? Don't start, remember, zen. Home sweet home, ladies. It's really old. It's called Victorian. It's got nice cross-breezes. Let me show you upstairs. Come on. I knew it. All right guys, be really careful with the railing. It's super delicate, and I broke one of them by accident already. Okay, so each bedroom is like painted totally different, like different kind of wallpaper, different colors, it's really cool. This is my room. It's a mess, shocker. And then Hailey, that's your room. Flowers, awesome. Well this is your room now. So pick a color and we'll paint it. Surrounding yourself by flowers is actually really good for your chi. You should consider keepin' it. And this is the master bedroom. This is beautiful. Okay, I'm gonna check out the bathroom. See ya, sport. You did good. This house is just amazing. Yeah this is perfect for us, yes, good job. I knew you guys would like it. I'll leave you to it. I just hope her and Hailey can get along. I can definitely sense something brewing there. No, no, they're gonna get along fine. The problem is they're so much alike. They're both rebels without a cause. Okay I think for Hailey it's called being a teenager. But for Shae, I don't know what that is. You know, Shae's been through a lot with Mom's death. But I think having family nearby is going to be really good for her. I agree. And with this new job, we can finally get back on track. Which I'm very grateful for. Me too. Todd, not now. What? Come on, it's okay. Hailey's outside. Your sister is downstairs. Shae does not care. Well it's weird. No it's not. Todd, no I'm not in the mood. You're never in the mood, Jess. I'm sorry. It was a long drive. I'm gonna go unpack. Hey, so how did you find this place? Just responded to an ad. The neighborhood looked really nice, and the house was really cheap considering the size of the place. So I jumped on it. I'm so surprised that it was even available. This house is fantastic. My real estate agent said something about the local economy being down. People aren't moving. Makes sense. Well, their loss. I think this place is fantastic. And I absolutely love the furniture. When I saw those baroque couches, I was like where do I sign? Baroque. Did the family before here leave their broke couch? I guess so. Nothing really matches. It's called character. Hey, do I have to go to school right away? Hey, yes, you have to go to school right away. Is there a specific reason why you don't want to? Come on Dad, think about it. The semester's almost over. I can start next semester. I'll work extra hard, and then it'll be a nice break. Please? Please? Seriously? You guys are way too easy on her. Seriously Shae? You don't really have a say here. Excuse me Hailey. You do not get to talk to your aunt that way. I'm sorry, I'm not the crazy drunk in the family. Hailey. I'm not gonna be the one that's passed out in the front yard. Now you're just being a little brat! You don't get to act like you're such a good person just because you're finally sober! Or are you? Great! This house sucks! Crickets. Nice shot, sport. What's going on with you? What do you mean? I mean you were very rude to your aunt Shae last night. It's not like you. Yeah, well she's a hypocrite. And I hate that. How is she a hypocrite? She tries to tell everyone else how to live their life. She can't even get her own life right. I get that, but you have to understand. Your aunt Shae, she's been through a lot. We need to be patient with her, help her. Isn't she supposed to be able to help herself? Isn't that what rehab's for? Sweetheart, can you do me a favor? What? Can you be the bigger person here so we can all get along? It'd mean a lot to me. Okay. That's the Hailey I know. I gotta go to work. Bye, Dad. You're good right? Scouts honor. This town sucks. Let's go find some trees. Woo! That's a cool bike. It's a Yamaha 125. Yeah, you ride? No, I'm just a big motorhead. Sorry, who are you exactly? I'm Hailey. Who told you about this place? Nobody, I just heard the music. So you took that as an invitation. Do you like Higher Flux? Yeah, I actually saw them in concert. I'm so jealous. What are you doing here? I just moved here to Amityville. Where in Amityville? On Amity, right where it dead ends. So where'd you see them? See who? Higher Flux. L.A. That's cool. Is that where you're from? No, I moved here from San Francisco. Okay, well welcome. Yeah, I think I'm gonna go. Probably for the best. Nice to meet you. Yeah okay. I guess I'll just see you around. See you around. Miss McCallister. Please, it's Delilah. Delilah. I guess you came for the rest of the rent check. Sorry, I've been painting all day. I'm really spaced out. An artist. It's more of a hobby really. Sorry I planned on dropping this off to you later today. Hi. You must be Jessica. Jessica, this is Delilah. She's the property manager on the house. Hi. Just stopping by to see how you're doing. We love the place. How's the garden? I've actually never had one before. But the moment we moved in, I had the sudden urge to just planting... Roses. Yes, exactly. I saw them outside. They're gorgeous. Thank you. Your husband and your daughter? Where are they, I would love to meet them. Todd is at work, and Hailey, she's probably out exploring or something. Pity. Do take care of the house. We will. Between you and I, it's my favorite property. And don't let the neighbors bother you. Why do they throw a lot of crazy parties? No, they keep to themselves. You're just not gonna make any friends. That's all right. Well we have plenty of drama in this family. Remember it's a small town. People like gossip. Don't you worry. What happens behind these walls stays behind these walls. I'm sure it will. Hey. -Hi. -Can I help you? Yeah I'm Todd Jacobson. I'm here to see Mike. Yeah, we've been expecting you. Cool. Yeah I'm Karen, nice to meet you. Hi Karen. Mike, Mike, hey. I got Todd here for you. What's up Mike? Hey Todd, Mike Arkos. Nice to finally meet you man. Glad to have you on board. Thank you. This is beautiful. What year is it? 1955 Imperial. Fixing up for a friend of mine. She's a beauty, isn't she? Yeah, she's great. How is everything else going? Good man. Happy you're here. Now I can pay full attention to the other shop. Come on, let me show you around. -Jesus you scared me. -What? I'm sorry. Who's your new friend? I found her while I was planting roses. Well she is extremely creepy. -She's not creepy. -No she's creepy. She's just old and dirty. Just like you. You know what, I bet some little girl loved her very, very, very much. No this isn't good. The problem with these old houses, they have a big issue with their plumbing. I'm gonna go check the basement for some drain cleaner. Have fun with your new friend. Hey Dad? Down here. This isn't ominous or anything. All basements are ominous, honey. That's why they're underneath the house, and not in the living room. So much junk down here. Who leaves this much stuff when they move? I don't know, but it's basically all cleaning supplies. Cool. Bingo. Everything's creep about this house. Come on, let's go. Why is it that color? This is industrial strength. It's really potent. Actually stand back a bit there, because if this gets on your skin, it'll burn you. My God! Why does it smell like that? I don't know. What's in this stuff? Shae? Shae? I can't get it open. Shae? Shae? Shae, open the door! My skin is burning! I'm bleeding! Honey, I don't think you're bleeding at all. It's probably just an acid trip. Not now, Hailey! I swear Todd, there is something in the water. And it was burning me. It was burning my skin. The drain cleaner! You didn't check to see if someone was taking a bath? Because that's not how plumbing works, Jess. That's impossible. I couldn't get up. What are you talking about? I couldn't get up. Don't touch me! Get out! I told you, it can't be connected. The drain cleaner, it's impossible. What else was it? I don't know. Maybe Hailey was right. Maybe she took something. Excuse me? Took something? Yeah, like... Great! Some acid or peyote. Great, we're living with a junkie. You said she was past all that, Todd! We're not living with a junkie, Jess. I will keep an eye on her. It's not a problem. Listen, I get it, she's your sister. But I have to make sure that you are not prioritizing your sister over our daughter. Jess, I would never do that. Really, cause you're doing it now. What does that mean? You gotta face it. Your sister's a drug addict. Our mother just died! She had one freak out episode Jessica! Have a little compassion. Yeah, but you know what? The way you handled that episode seems like you've done that before. How I handled it? I did everything I could! What are you talking about? You seem pretty natural with it! What? Is this something that you guys grew up with? Did you do this when you guys were kids? What's going on? You don't know that she's on drugs. She had one... She was on something. I know as much as you. I don't know. Still wear it like a tattoo Feel like magic and voodoo? How's she doin'? She's calmed down. I checked her skin; she's fine. Well that's a relief. Look Jess, I'm s... I'm sorry. Come here, come here, no. Listen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. It's just, you know with all this creepy and craziness. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. This is not the first episode that she has had. Why does it even happen? Honestly, I don't know. It could be stress, trauma, you know Mom's death is a lot for Shae. Morning sunshine. Hi. Have I told you how proud I am of you? Why? Why, because you're brave. You're going to a new school, and that totally sucks. But you're doing it, and I'm proud of you. At this point I'll take any reason to get out of this house. Well, whatever motivates you. It doesn't mean I wanna go to school. Look you don't have to wanna go. You just have to do it, and you are. So I'm proud of you. Fine, I accept your pride. Thank God! I wasn't sure where I was gonna put it today. I'll see you later. Bye. No no no, wait wait wait. Hailey, I made breakfast! Hi. Is this your ball? Yeah. What's your name? Penny. I'm Hailey. I like your bike. I don't get to ride bikes. Yeah? You wanna check it out? I can't cross the line. What line? Did you meet Rachel? Rachel? My friend. She lives in your house. Did she move? No. Well just my family now. Rachel's there too. I haven't seen her. Doesn't mean she's not there. Yeah. Scott Green, please report to the principal's office. Scott, please report to the principal's office. Hey. Hey yourself. You know, you didn't have to disappear before. You could've hung out. Yeah, well your friends weren't exactly inviting. I don't know if I'd exactly call them my friends. Okay, well let me make it up to you. What are you doing after school? I work. My dad owns the tavern in town. I help him out. And after work? It's a bar. I get out kinda late. Okay, then I guess I'll just see you around. Has anyone seen Mia today? I think she has her period, Mrs. Taylor. Thank you Theresa for the update. But I don't think we need to know Mia's personal business. I just didn't wanna be vague, Mrs. Taylor. Moving on. Let's start where we left off yesterday. Exercise seven. Did you hear? Mia fucked Tim Bradley in the back of his car, and he filmed the whole thing. And it went viral. Now she's never leaving her room. I heard Mia went to the Amity house on a dare. But that was weeks ago and no one's seen her since. That's a lie Sally, and you know it. What are you guys talking about? Nothing, new girl. Mind your own business. Yeah, mind your business, Dirt Bike. That's not an insult. Whatever, Failey. Failey, you're doing it wrong. Girls, what's going on over here? I tried to tell her to be careful, Mrs. Taylor. But she wouldn't listen. All right, go get cleaned up. She won't last long. What happened to you? Wet t-shirt contest. Room Eight, you missed it? Apparently. I didn't get the memo. Bummer. Here. It'll be like it never happened. Okay. Hello. Hello? Hey Shae? Shae, I'm out in the garden. So if the phone rings, could you answer it? Hey, how's it goin' over there? Hey Mike, it's goin'. Yeah? Yeah, I'm busy. You okay? You seem a little bit out of it. Long night. Actually, let me ask you somethin'. Have you ever heard of drain cleaner backing up and coming out of another faucet? No. Sounds crazy right? Technically impossible. That's what I said. Why? My sister Shae was taking a bath last night and had this freak out episode. And now my wife is convinced that the drain cleaner I poured into our sink somehow came up through the tub. Wait, Shae Jacobson? Yeah. That's your sister? Yeah. I used to date Shae back in college for about two years. Shit. You're that Mike! Yeah, you must be Toddy Bear? Toddy Bear. Man I haven't heard from Shae in years. How did you guys end up over here? Well she was up here for a while actually, takin' care of our mom. And she passed, and at the time it made sense for my family and her to all move in together. And she actually found a great house in the neighborhood. Where? Amity Way, at the end of the cul-de-sac. So how did you guys come across that place? She answered an ad. Shae is doing all right? Yeah, no she's fine. She's a tough cookie. So she bounced back. Look, I gotta go. I might drop by later on to say hi to Shae. Okay, yeah sounds good man. Hey, I did the inventory, and loaded the beers. Can I go meet the guys? Storage unit locked up? Yeah. Hey, Dad if you need me to stay... No it's all right, I got Jones comin' in at eight. You go on, get outta here. I'll be back later. How much later? Be home by 10. No excuses. Yes sir. Hey. Hey. I was just gonna return your jacket. Right, thank you. How did you know I was here? You said you worked at your dad's bar. There's only two in town. And one of them's a strip club. So I used my instincts. Right, right. Well I was jut about to get outta here. You want a ride? Why not? Well come on. Woo! That was awesome. Man. So you gonna tell me why you feel the need to carry that thing around? My crossbow? Yeah. I mean, this is a pretty safe neighborhood. You can never be too careful. It's a historical fact that small towns are breeding ground for serial killers. Who said that again? History. Right, of course. You ever heard of a gun? Too predictable. You wanna try? No, I'm good. You ever actually shoot anybody with that thing? No, but I wouldn't mind putting an arrow through my aunt Shae's ass. Okay, so you don't like her obviously. Nope, now I have to live with her. That sucks. Yeah. She's gone absolutely crazy. She was in the bathtub last night. She started screaming, crying, the whole nine yards. She thought her sin was burning off. Burning off? Yeah like acid burning her skin off. What? Nothing, nothing. Anyway, she went crazy and it made my parents fight. And so they got in to this huge argument. And it was, seriously what? I shouldn't say anything. Okay. Something bad happened in that house. What happened? A while back, this kid, Jimmy Oberest, he poured acid in the bathtub and drowned his baby sister. And then he killed his parents. Shit. It was a long time ago. Nobody even really talks about it anymore. That's totally creepy. Won't be taking a bath any time soon. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. No no no, I'm glad you did. It's nice to just have someone to talk to. We should probably get going. Okay. Hello, hello, Shae? Yeah boy, did you find a chicken? Hello? Hello. Shae? Shae, it's me Mike. Open up, we need to talk. Shae? Shae open up, it's me. Hey, where's Delilah? Screwin' around in the kitchen. Delilah. Mike. We have to talk. Don't stop. The people you moved into Amity house, Shae is a good friend of mine. Shae I love her. She's an artist. Look, you have to get them out of there. Stop. Just stop. I don't tell you how to run your business. Don't tell me how to run mine. It's not right. You know it. Well the house can't be empty. As long as tenants pay, I don't care who they are. You're a sick bitch. I love it when you talk dirty to me. Hey Mike! It's like Vegas, baby. Never bet against the house. Shae? Shae, Jess is makin' dinner I just, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. What do you want? I don't want anything. Jess is making dinner. I was just wondering if you wanted some. I'm not hungry. Okay. Are you feelin' all right? Do I look all right? You look tired. Well I feel perfect. Wanna see what I'm working on? No, no I'll wait 'til it's finished. Well that was... Yeah it was. I... Keep it. I'll get it the next time. Son, you know what time it is? Dad, I'm sorry. You're sorry, then you know how late you are. Get inside now. What are you doing? Your door was open, so I just... Put that down. Do you like it? Yeah, I mean the colors are amazing. I think you got a keeper. Okay. You know what I think? I think you're just a puppet that says whatever her daddy wants her to say, 'cause she doesn't have a personality of her own. I think you act tough and cool so you can hide who you really are, forgettable, unloveable. Why would you say that? 'Cause the truth is important. I wish you would've died instead of your brother. He only pretends to love you. Think about how happy your father would be if he had a son. Hailey. Hailey, are you okay? Damnit. Have you seen Todd? Todd! Fuck! Shit! Todd! Stop the leak. Todd, stop now! Turn this thing off! Todd, stop that, turn it off! Todd, turn the welder off! Stop, stop Todd! Turn the welder off! Todd! You want a cigarette, Failey? No. You gonna tell on us? Why would I stop you from slowly killing yourselves? Nobody knows when they're gonna die, Failey. I'd treasure this moment if I were you. Yeah, tomorrow could be your last. Maybe not. I saw the way you looked at my boyfriend, btdubs. Sorry who's your boyfriend? I think you know. Watch your back, Failey, or you'll find a knife in it. Ladies? Hailey. What are you doing? She slipped and fell. Classic Hailey. Hailey? Yeah, fine. He lived in my house. I know it because my aunt Shae found his medical kit in her closet. And in the picture, his daughter's holding the same doll that my mom found buried in the garden. Okay, so he lived there. So what? So there's no record of him since 2004. He doesn't exist Brett. He's dead. He died in my house. His family died in my house, I know it. I can't prove it, but I've seen him. And then there's this music box, and it plays at really weird times. Like it knows. Do I sound crazy? No, I don't think so. I can't think about this right now. Yeah that's fine, we'll just chill. I haven't seen you around here before. What's your name? Todd. Todd, you must not live around here. Just drivin' through? No I live here. Lucky for me. I'm married. Didn't ask. What about you, your first concert? I have never been to a concert. No way. Are you serious? Yeah. Not a lot of bands come through Amityville. Right. We should run away, escape to civilization some time. Go see a concert? I actually wanna manage my own band someday. Well, you know more about what you wanna do than I do. My dad gets a lot of credit for that. Taught me everything I know. How to be curious, ride a bike, shoot arrows, play guitar. You play guitar too? You play guitar? Yeah! Yeah, that's awesome! Yeah... We should jam. If I can remember how to play. My mom was teaching me before she died. I didn't know your mom was dead. Yeah. Sorry. It happened when I was 13. I'm just glad that I got the chance to know her. You know? Yeah. I actually had a little brother. But he died when I was really little. He was just a baby. I didn't know him at all. You know it's funny. A lot of time when people find out that I lost my mom, they try to be sympathetic. But I know that for the most part they don't get it. It's just nice to meet somebody who does. Come on, let's go. Where? I think I might know somebody who can help us. Hi Brett, I was expecting you. This is your room? It's cool right? Those are my solar crystals. These ones absorb positive energy, those deflect evil. Deflect evil. Yeah, keep out the bad energy. What about that one around your neck? You told me it was really powerful. Yeah, it's an ancient protection crystal. It's been passed down for several generations in my family. Can't part with it. Well do you have anything like that for Hailey? She just moved to a new place in Amityville, and her aunt is kinda nuts. Yeah, I have lots of stones for new houses. Hailey go into the bathroom and grab the floral bag in the third drawer. Okay, I... It's the second door on the right. What are you doing? What do you mean? That's the new girl that just moved to the Amity house. Yeah, how did you... Word travels fast. Not to mention, Theresa is not a fan of hers. Come on Jenny, she really needs your help. Of course she needs my help. Everyone needs my help. But I can't get involved in this. You have to go. Hey, Jenny, is this it? Exactly. This is bloodstone. It's known for its protective qualities. I think I'm gonna need somethin' a little bigger. It was nice to meet you Hailey. Thanks for coming over. See you later Brett? Hey baby. Why didn't you answer your phone? I was here the whole time, sweetheart. I killed Mike today. What? I killed Mike. What happened? There was an accident. Well accidents happen. Not like this. There was fire and it just happened so quick. And I saw the look in his eyes right before he right before he died. I just wanna make you feel better. Todd, is that you? Jess? I had the strangest day today. None of my roses wanted to live. Nothing wants to live here. Hey. Hey. Hey. If I get involved in this and people find out, you know what's gonna happen. Yeah, I know. And there's no guarantee it's gonna change the outcome. Nobody, I mean nobody can know. I get it. Look Hailey is a good person. She doesn't deserve this. I have an idea. That's the living room. Kitchen's down back through there. And your bedroom? It's upstairs. This is it. So you gonna rid the house of evil spirits or something? Can't get rid of the evil, it's too powerful. The best thing I can do is create a safe place. A safe place? Somewhere you can go if things get bad. What do you mean by bad? I mean bad. What about my parents? You can bring them with you. This can be their safe place too. I'm gonna put these around the room. Whatever you do, don't move them. Can I get some water? Yeah, yeah of course. I'll grab you some. Hey, how's it going? The spell's complete. I think you'll be okay. Jenny! Looks like someone tried to help Failey bite off more than she can chew. You heard the whispers and the rumors When you rolled into town You felt the evil in the air outside swirlin' round and round I'm all emaciated glad you made it through the front door But chances are you might not like what's in store Pay no attention to the voices you hear beyond the walls Those iridescent nasty windbag in your woo And you don't wanna see this other side of me But can you see me from a new point of view See delusions and deja vu Feels all broken and insulting Feel wear it like a tattoo Feel like magic and voodoo? Hello. Hi, I'm looking for David Cranston. Speaking. Awesome, I was actually calling about your brother, Willis Cranston. Who is this? I actually moved into the house I think your brother used to live in. I found some of his surgical supplies, and I wanted to return them to... Well that's very kind of you. But we haven't heard from Willis for over a decade now. Would you mind if I ask what happened? I wish I knew. Once he moved to Amityville, we never heard from him again. I contacted the police who said that the property manager said that they'd handed in the notice and moved on. To be honest it was very strange. He would never just have left without telling me. It doesn't make any sense. Who was the property manager at the time? McCallister, Delilah McCallister. Well well. Honey, you know trespassing is illegal. Put the files down. I will cut out your heart and eat it. How does somebody just fall out of a closed window? I don't know, Jess. And our neighbors just stood around like nothing happened? Hailey? Dad, Dad I just went to Delilah McCallister's house and I found all of this information about past renters. There's been hundreds. Dad, hundreds! Okay Hailey, slow down. What are you talking about? Since the '70s, people have been moving in and out of our house. They never stay longer than three months. I'm willing to bet they're all missing. Okay Hailey, this is crazy. Why don't you just come home and... Dad, you need to get Mom and Shae, and you need to get out of the house. Okay, I'm at the police station. Hailey, Hailey? Lost her. Dad? Dad? I just, I don't think that we should be here anymore Todd. I'm serious. We're gonna wait for Hailey to come home. We will leave first thing in the morning. I'm gonna go talk to Shae okay? I'm gonna start packing. Hey. Brett? Thank God, are you okay? Yeah I'm fine. I heard about Jenny. Look I am so sorry. Brett I think I know what's happening with my house. Hailey hold on. Delilah is moving people in there and killing them. It's not Delilah. I mean it is, kind of. Do you remember what I told you about Jimmy Oberest? Yeah he drowned his sister in a bathtub with acid and killed his family. Hailey, Jimmy and his entire family were into black magic. They believed if they made these human sacrifices that they'd be granted eternal life. They killed people. Lots of people. Whatever they did, it was like they opened a portal to hell or something. What's Delilah's connection? Delilah was Jimmy's baby sister. What? Not the one he drowned. She had pneumonia. She was in a hospital during the time of the murders. My God, I'm at the police station. And they're putting Jenny's body in a trunk. Look there's so much more. I need to tell you in person. Look, I gotta go. I'll meet you at the cabin in an hour okay? Todd? Todd what's wrong? Todd? Todd let me out! Todd I can't open the door! Todd? Todd? Todd? Todd! Bad choice Brett. Bravo, I see you found your family's new home. Do you like it? It's super cozy. Why are you doing this to me? I'm doing you a favor. You were marked for death anyway. And trust me, this stuff is better than the alternative. How was I marked for death? Nobody who lives in the Amity house comes out alive. And if we don't feed the house and keep the spirits happy, it comes for us. No one with a choice wants that. Right girls? Sorry Theresa, but your possessed house is about to get real hungry. Holy shit, T, you know how she felt about her face! You know Hailey, you and I could've been friends. We have a lot in common. No, Theresa, we have absolutely nothing in common! I disagree! We both loved Brett didn't we? Why'd you have to go and steal my boyfriend, Hailey? You have to ruin everything you selfish bitch! Brett was never your boyfriend! Yeah? Well now he'll never be yours! My God, no! No no no no no no no no! Please please please please please. Shae! Hailey. Hailey. Hailey. You can't hide from me. Hailey! It's vacant and available immediately. Thank you so much for showing us your house, Delilah. We're looking for a nice home to raise our family in. I'm gonna have a brother or sister. That's right, we're trying for another. Well that's wonderful because we have three bedrooms. It's exactly what we're lookin' for. Yeah. I think we'll take it. Girl you got that hold on me I say hey you got your hold on me And I find the clouds cooler I can meet you in the stratosphere I'm feelin' warm and fuzzy late at night Expedition back to earth I start to question my self-worth So I start beggin' for one more dose Of course I said hey girl, you got that hold on me I said hey girl, you got your hold on me As we cruise among the stars The sun and moon don't seen that far At hyper speed we blast away yeah But as our rocket fuel was out You say farewell and then breathe while Gravitational pull pulls me, pulls me I said hey girl, yeah
