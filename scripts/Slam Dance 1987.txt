She was unbelievable. She was on the corner of Sunset. So, what is it you need, Cletus? Give me some advice, Blade. l need someone to get me out of here, man. Cletus, you're a lucky man... because l got this friend who plays a mean guitar... and he's studying law, and right now... he's in county jail. So, look for Pete. Cell 47. He can get anyone out. Wait. What's his name? l'm sorry, Cletus. We're out of time. This is my only call, man. Next caller, please. Hello. You're on the air. Hello. l'm not the suspicious type... Hold it, hold it. This isn't me. Did l fool you? This is an answering machine. Pretty nifty, huh? So, if you wait for the tone... l'll be happy to pass it along to Drood... whenever he comes home or wakes up... or whatever he does. Are you ready? Drood, pick up the phone. l know you're there. Pick up the phone, Drood! Shit! Helen-- Look, how many times do l ask you to do me a favor? l'm out the door. No, no. Forget it. Forget it. l took her to school already. Jeez.

And actually, l'd like to see this teeth thing. l lost them in a fight. Your back teeth? Daddy likes to tell stories. Mommy says he tells stories all the time. Blade Line. Let's go to our next call. Hello. You're on the air. You got to help me! l'm calling you from a pit where my house used to be. Um, excuse me. What's your name, sir? My name's Ethan, and you got to help me. This UFO-thing, looked like a big Buick hubcap... come down, sucked up my furniture with-- l don't know, some sort of a hose or something. Sucked up everything. l went to get the bowling trophies... you know, it's important to me... to get my bowling trophies... and, you're not gonna believe it... l come back, my family was gone. What? Bad move, Ethan. Hi, Drood! Oh, my God! Drood! That didn't hurt. Arrest that kid. Would you grow up? Children, please! How do you do it? Do what? Well, you walk in and everything falls apart. Helen, l got hit in the nuts... with a fucking rubber chicken. Right, laugh. l'm sorry. l got to sit down. Oh, come on. What are you doing here, Drood? l just... l, l, l... Helen, what do you think... about you and l getting back together? Yes, l need-- l need a hand here. So, which hand would you like, sir? Listen, don't fool around. l'm trying to make a chicken.

She gave you something. -Who? -Who? Ha, who? Fuck this! Let me get back there! Be just a few minutes, Mr. Drood. Thank you. Anybody tell you to move? l'm not-- Sit over here! Look, l think-- Listen, l am not supposed to be-- No one is. Look, l... You are making a big mistake! l'm going to kill every fuckin' guy in here. You fucked my wife? What's her name? Oh, no. No! No! Hold it! Wait a second! Hey! Hey! Hey, which one of you guys is Charles Drood? l am. So, you never saw either one of these men before? Nope. And if you saw them again... do you think you could identify them? Yeah, maybe. Listen, l don't know. They didn't take anything, right? Nope. Nothing. And you don't know what they were after? That it? Not quite, Mr. Drood. You see, your kidnapping may be connected... to a case that we're investigating here... in which you may be considered a suspect. A suspect for what? Well, l have to advise you that... you have a right to remain silent... and have the services of a lawyer... but if you haven't done anything wrong... you've got nothing to worry about... and l can get you out of here... a hell of a lot sooner. l don't need a lawyer. All right. What can you tell me about a girl named... Yolanda Caldwell? Nothing. Nothing! They just found her body today, Mr. Drood. You're supposed to say you love me now. ''l would characterize the relationship... ''as primarily sexual as l knew-- ''as l never knew very much about her private life... ''outside of our relationship-- ''her marital status, place of birth... friends, et cetera''? Right. Weren't you curious? She wouldn't tell me. ''The last time l saw her... we had agreed to go away together.'' No, l--l--l said that l would meet her there. l... l didn't exactly say that l would go away with her. ''l never went to the station.'' Well, why not? l don't know. l didn't go! l've got a wife. l've got a kid! l just didn't go, OK? OK, OK. Let's go over it again. Frank. ''l met Yolanda Caldwell... ''at a party in a West Hollywood dance club... run by a friend named James Campbell.'' Hello there, darling. Fancy a little dance, do you? Yes. Excuse me. Excuse me! ls that one of those trick lighters? No. ls that a wedding ring? You ask a lot of questions. l never met a woman with a gun before. Were you in love with her, Mr. Drood? You still haven't answered me, Mr. Drood. Did you love her? l don't know. l don't know what that means. Mr. Drood. Yeah, uh... Listen, Mrs. Raines... l'm probably going to be moving from here. What? Where's your hearing aid? What? l'll talk to you later. Oh, Mr. Drood. What? What? Your envelope! l've written a letter of complaint... to the postal service in Washington, D.C. l didn't want to send it locally... because l'm sure that our mailman superior... is a part and parcel of the conspiracy. l can't go back. What conspiracy? Mr. Drood... you look terrible. What conspiracy? To lose our mail. Haven't you noticed anything missing? Come on. OK. Go to the window. Go to the window! Turn around. Close the blinds. Get down on your knees. Come on. You don't have to do this. l promise you-- Shut up. She thought you were so smart. OK. Let's see how smart you are. OK? All right. You got an envelope like this? Yes? OK, go get it. Go get it. Fast! Quick! Come on! Put it down on the table. OK, put that inside. Don't look at it, just put it inside. That's very good. You just forget this. l'm doing you a big favor here. Hey! Hey! What, are you crazy? Give me the lighter. You are nuts. Why can't you say it? Give me the lighter. So damn guarded. Me? What about you? l have to be. Why? What could be so terrible? You'll be there? l said l would. You'll really be there? l'll be there. Daddy. Am l going high? Real high, baby. Come on, let's go play in the sand! Let's go play in the sand. Drood? You all right? Yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah, l... -You're sure? -l'm just off someplace again. Good. l talked to Jim this morning. Yeah? Yeah. He said your place got broken into. l told him not to tell you anything. Come on, he just knew l'd be concerned... that's all. lt was nothing. What do you mean, it's nothing? Somebody breaks into your apartment... and you're gonna try and tell me it's nothing now? What is that? lt was nothing, really. They didn't even take anything. ls that for me? Yes. Ketchup only. Thank you. l've been thinking about, um... what we were talking about the other day. What? About us getting back together. And? l don't think it's such a good idea right now. Yeah. l don't think anything has changed with you. l don't know. Up you go. You don't have to eat all of it. Just what you can. Mr. Drood. l know. That's a new lock. This is a new lock here. ls it? Listen, Mrs. Raines-- l don't have a key for that. l made you a key. lf there should be a fire or something-- Fuck. l made you this key! Do you have one for me? Oh, God. Tequila. What? Shot of tequila. Five bucks. l'm a friend of Jim's. Friend of Jim's? Yeah. Five bucks. Five tequilas, then. What are you doing? l'm not doing anything. l'm doing what you said. Nothin'. ls that what l said? What do you want? Huh? She loved you. Somebody kills her... and you just blow it off. lsn't that what you wanted? You put a fuckin' gun to my head. ls that what's stopping you? The gun? Who do you think you're fooling? lt ain't the gun that stops us. We're just chicken shit. See? The lights are on... but nobody's home. Am l right? Yeah. Mr. Drood? There's just the two. There's this one... and follow-up on page 3. Oh, God. So, what do you think? l think we got a guy with a wife and a kid... and he's been cheating on her. l wanted to be different for a long time... but l was the same. l was always the same. l can't go back. Back to what? Van Gogh's Pizza, Teriyaki Chicken... and Burrito, Too. You want to make an order? Hello. Hold it. This isn't me. Zeta Temporary Office Services. What are you doing here, Mr. Drood? This is a crime scene. You're interfering with a police investigation. What the hell are you doing here? l didn't kill her. Who's there? What's the matter? Jesus. You scared the shit out of me. How did you get in here? Mrs. Raines let me in. Nice. What's all this, then? This is that Yolanda girl, isn't it? Yeah. You've been walking the same cage... for too long, my friend. Listen, Jim... what do you know about her? She's dead. That's what l know about her. Dead and gone. Hey, l heard a terrific joke at the club tonight. Yeah, l met her that night at your club.

Helen, no please-- ...with the death of Yolanda Caldwell... is the murder of Adrienne Schell... who was found shot through the head... in the apartment of newspaper cartoonist... C.C. Drood earlier this morning. Drood, previously questioned in the case... is now the prime suspect in the investigation. Police have issued... an all-points bulletin for his arrest. He is described as a 30-year-old white male... 5 feet, 11 inches, 180 pounds... thought to be driving a 1960-- Scoot over. lt's not just you and me. There's a lot of people involved in this-- big people-- anyone who went to a party. Drood has got to go down on this... or we all go down. Hi, Jim. Have you talked to Drood today at all? No, uh, damn! Drood had a book. lt was a little red appointment book. And he used to write down all of his important things. And l think he kept it in here. Now, have you seen it? Did you find that in here? Oh, he was always such a nice man. We're not open yet, pal. OK, Don, l want this bar ready by 9:30. Oh, Christ. Come on. What are you going to do? You got something to drink? l'm afraid to go in a fuckin' liquor store! Drood, you're making the front page, man. You're on television. Helen's going crazy... and Bean's having trouble at school. Are you going to listen to me or not? No! You're a selfish fuck! l'm calling the police... to tell them you want to turn yourself-- Come on, Drood, stop, now! l need your car. -My car? -Yeah. Forget it. -Give me the keys. -No. Give me the fucking keys! ''Bobby Nye.'' ''Nancy Barron... aide to Bobby Nye.'' -Gee, uh... -Never mind. Never mind. No, no, don't bother yourself. George. Would you get this gentleman another drink? Here, let me introduce you to a few people. Uh, no. This is Councilman Hancock and his wife Dorothy. Supervisor Gleland, Mr. McBragg... and Patricia Menninger. And this is Mr. Drood... isn't it? Mr. Drood is an artist. l'm afraid l'm not familiar with your work, Mr. Drood. Oh, you will be, Pat. Excuse me. Your champagne. May l get you anything else, Miss Nye? Bobby Nye? You're Bobby Nye? Let me show you around. Come on. What do you think, Mr. Drood? l overpaid a bit for that. But l think its value is about to skyrocket. That's what usually happens when an artist dies. You killed her. That depends. l prefer to think that you killed her. She betrayed me. Over what? Some...some... some...pictures? Some photographs? You don't know what love is... do you? What a fuckin' joke. Let me tell you something. She was nice to me. She was very nice to me. But Miss Nye told me to hit her... and l did. And she fell. She hit her fuckin' head on a coffee table. She broke her neck. lsn't that something? The whole thing's a fuckin' accident. Well... Please. Please. l'm sorry, Mr. Drood. No! No. -Hello. -Helen. -Drood. -Are you alone? No, no, not exactly. l need your help. Yes, yes, l know. Do you remember our second honeymoon? Do...what?

What do you want me to do? l need your help. -OK, l'm listening. -l need some money... and a change of clothes. OK. l--l will be there as soon as l can. Jim, will you watch Bean for me, please? You're going, then? Helen, he's off his bloody head. Hello. -Detective Smiley, please. -This is he. Detective, this is Helen Drood. l know where my husband is. Helen, this is completely insane. Where are my keys? -Helen! -Jim, please let me go. What are you doing? What are you doing? Thank you. Thank you. lt's Bean's. l thought you might need a hat. What's wrong? l'm just imagining myself on the run... in this hat. Drood, stop it. Fugitive elf! No, Drood! Drood! Drood! lt's Smiley. What? l called Detective Smiley. You what? All you have to do is talk to him. That's all. Helen, Helen, are you crazy? -No, just talk to him! -No! -Drood, no! -Helen, no! Helen, don't open the door! -Helen! -He's got a gun. Mr. Drood. Can you hear me, Mr. Drood? l just want to talk to you. -Helen, get out of there. -Look, Mr. Drood... l'm going to show you my hands, all right? OK, l'm gonna come into the room now-- No! Drood.

Would you please-- l told him you couldn't kill anybody! l wasn't trying. lf l was trying, l would have missed. Oh, God! Drood, what are we gonna do? Fuck! Now l'm a cop killer. l am dead. l'm... Drood. l'm dead. Drood, you're scaring me. l'm a dead man, Helen! Where's the tool box? l've got it. l got it. -Go! Go! Go! -l'm going, l'm going! What are you doing? Turn up here. No, right! Dear God, Drood! -l'm gonna kill myself. -What? Drood, just say something that makes sense, all right? Tell them that l forced you to drive me up here... that l said that... l had to meet somebody. You picked me up outside the hotel. You weren't in the room, OK? What do l tell Bean? Tell her that l'll be there. OK? OK, OK. Take care of yourself. l love you. Lights are on... but nobody's home. ''...surely goodness and mercy shall follow me... ''all the days of my life... ''and l will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.'' -Helen... -Drop dead.
