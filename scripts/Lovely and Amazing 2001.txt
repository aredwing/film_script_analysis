Put your arm back where it was. Give us a nice look. Does this seem strange to you? No, it's high fashion. It's sophisticated. It's totally hot. But my dress... I feel sort of... I thought you said you liked this designer. I do. I'm just not sure. I just don't feel quite like myself. Who does? - Got your bathing suit? - Yep. - Your book? - Yep. Got your jacket? MC Whitie or Winky Fresh? Winky Fresh. Excuse me... do you know if the buyer's here today? What can I help you with? I was wondering if the store might be interested in these things that I made. - Let's see. - Okay. This one has a bird in a nest. - Oh, delicate. - Yeah. What are these? They're nice. Thanks. Don't you wish we were little enough to sit in them? Woman: Michelle Marks? - Oh my God! - Debbie Waldman? Emerson Junior High. - God, you look great. - Thanks. - What are you doing here? - I made these chairs and I was hoping the store might want to sell them. - Oh, they're so cute! - Thanks. What about you? What are you up to? I'm a pediatrician. Are you kidding me? No... why? Oh, I don't know. It just seems... - it seems too fast. - We're 36. I know, but we're not 36, 36. Store clerk: Ahem... How much would you sell them for? I would need to make about $50 on each one. That's a bargain. Clerk #2: We couldn't buy them from you for that much. Well, I could take 40 maybe. Clerk #1: That's okay. They're not for us anyway. Okay. Clerk #2: We used to have something similar. Remember that guy? He made these little tables - out of string. - Yes, I remember him. Nobody bought them. Bitch! Excuse me? Nothing. (cell phone rings) Dr. Waldman... Yes... - It was great seeing you. - You too. - You were always so creative. - Yeah. No, it was... I just ran into someone... I'll be there in 10 minutes or so. Annie? Hey! How are you doing? How are you doing? Are you ready for our first date? Woman: Pick you up later. I want to stay with you. Honey, if you're having a bad time, call me. I want you to push off. Push off with your feet and reach out for me, okay? Good! Reach out for me... Yes! Good, see? How's you get your hair to do that? - Do what? - Be so straight? I straightened it. I fried it like straw. Feel it. - Ew! - Told you! Okay, now I want you to go for me - to the other side. - Okay. All right, go. Do it! Kick, kick! Tell your mom to wear a bathing cap in there, okay? What did she say? She said you need to wear a bathing cap in the pool. (laughing) You don't understand, Paul. I looked insane. I was wearing this weird see-through designer thing. I felt like an idiot. And I tried, I really did, but the fashion stylist was so intimidating. You should have seen the color they had on my lips. I can't believe I'm going to be in Vogue Magazine - looking like that! - Maybe you shouldn't have done it. How can you say that? It's publicity for the movie. I have to do it. Posing for a fashion magazine has nothing to do with acting. So if some magazine called and said they were doing an article on nature journalists and wanted your picture, you'd say no? - Right. - You're so high and mighty. You don't understand what I'm saying. Everyone wants their picture in a magazine. - They do? - Yes, if they admit it. I just think... if it's going to make you upset, you shouldn't do it. Maybe you think I'm not attractive enough to ever look good having my picture taken? I know you think my arms are flabby. I'm going to the bathroom. Mother: Like it? It costs too much but I think it's so pretty. I don't see why you need it. Because nothing else picks up the dark tones in the chair. There's nowhere to lie down. I take them off if I want to lie down. Maybe I should be making pillows. Any luck at the gift store? No. But I ran into Debbie Waldman. Who? Debbie Waldman. From Emerson. She used to be such a loser. Maybe you should just get a job. You know... a job job. Thanks for your support. Hi, honey. Why are you eating cookies before dinner? They're the fat-free ones. Doesn't make any difference. They're high in calories. Mom! I didn't put them in her hand. - You bought them. - She begged me. (spits) - You're the mother! - Still. Annie: I thought these weren't the bad kind. - Let's go home. Bye. - Bye. - Goodnight, sweetheart. - Goodnight. - Sweet dreams. - You too. I hate my life. You need more of one. Blah, blah! Arturo stole my commission today. Are you serious? Did you tell him to fuck off? Of course not. I have to work with him every day. Well, I would still tell him. - Oh my God! - What? It's my sister's movie. She's in the ad. She doesn't even have a big part. Hey, you're in Jane Magazine. In an ad for your movie. - Really? It must be tiny. - No, it's big. I mean your head is... is half an inch big. But it doesn't really look like you. I don't think it's your hair. Well, whose hair is it? It's a little Phyllis Diller-y. It's frizzy? No, it's not frizzy. It's just... - I don't know. Go buy it. - I think I'll skip it. Why are you panting? Paul's over. We're doing yoga. - (laughs) - What's so funny? You guys do yoga together? - I'm hanging up. - Bye. She wasn't excited? No, she's not even going to get it. She said your hair looked bad? Like Phyllis Diller. Was she jealous? Are you kidding? My sister's jealous of everything. Hey baby, how's it healing? You make $200,000 a year? - Sometimes. - Wow! God! You could get a personal trainer. - I like running with you. - Aw, still. I tried to sell my chairs the other day. Nobody wanted them. What a drag. What does Bill say? Oh, he thinks they're an enormous waste of time. He stepped on one once by accident. - If you can be freelance, do it. - Yeah. I worked so hard last year, I hardly saw Jessie. She spent almost every weekend with her dad. - Was he into it? - He's crazy about her. When we were growing up I saw my father maybe twice a year. And he lived like 10 blocks away. Jessie's lucky. Did your mom ever remarry? Oh no, unfortunately. She hasn't been with anybody in a really long time. I think she's pretty lonely. - How did you get this? - I had a mole removed. I see. We're gonna do a little here. I don't want to do you with the wrong pen. - You're gonna draw on me? - I'm gonna draw on you. - We're gonna do a little here. - That tickles. This is the hard part. Just look forward, okay? You'll have a chance to look at my arts and crafts in a minute. Then we'll do a little on this side so that you're not lopsided. Then we do a bigger chunk right here in front with a happy face on it. I really should exercise more. - (chuckles) - It's not lack of exercise. It's loss of elasticity. Mother Nature. You can expect to lose a little weight through skin loss alone. - Skin loss? - Yes. We're going to tighten your skin here and then down here where it's stretched. What do you do with the skin when you're through with it? We send it to pathology. One option is donating it to a burn center. (whispers) Sorry, I feel a little dizzy. - Oops! - Sorry. Have a seat. Put your head between your knees. Hold your head. That's it. Much better. Come on, Vince. Come on. Vince? Can't you smell it? Are you going to come to the premiere with me? You should take someone you'll have more fun with. I want to take you. Then I'm there. Good doggy, yes you are. Good dog. - Sweetie? - Yeah. How many dogs are you going to have? I don't know. - You're kind. - You think I'm an idiot. I think you spend too much time saving lost dogs. (dog moans) Thanks, Gina. Did you ever cheat on Dad? Mother: No. Why not? I don't know. We did this threesome thing once, but it was more of a joke than anything else. A threesome? Don't look at me that way. Everybody was doing it. You shouldn't tell me shit like that. Maybe you should try it. Loosen up a little. - Ha ha! - What do you think? They're a size eight. Should I buy them as a reward? How do you know you'll be that small? Dr. Crane said so. Can you believe it? I'm finally gonna get rid of my gut! I don't understand. Nobody sees you naked anyway. Will you take care of Annie while I'm in the hospital? - I thought it was out-patient. - It is, but I won't be well enough to do anything for two days. So that's how long she'd stay with you. Is that okay? It's a lot with two kids, Mom. Can't Elizabeth do it? You have no job and Maddy has a ton of play dates. Okay, I'll do it. Don't expect me to do it with joy all over me. I won't. It's a lot, that's all. You mean Annie's a lot. Mom, I'll do it, okay? - What's it for? - The hell of it. - You're so sweet. - No, I'm not. I'm regifting. It has self-esteem and tranquility or something. I'm so happy for it. No, jerk, you burn it and it helps you have self-esteem and tranquility. - Should I be offended? - Hell no. I have them burning all over my house. Listen, I have good news. They want you back on Riot Act. I can't believe it. I didn't think I did that well. Well enough, obviously. They want you to meet with Kevin. - You're kidding me? - No. - Oh my God. - This would be the best break. I'll never get it. They want to see the two of you together. You mean he wants to read with me? Yeah, but mostly to see if you guys are... you know, hot together. It's a chemistry read. Don't look at me. I think he's gross. Maddy: Mom. - What? - Come read with me. Come watch Hickory Dog. - Hi. - Hi. How was work? Where's Maddy? Reading in her room. Come sit with me. - What are you watching? - Hickory Dog. We haven't had sex in so long. It hasn't been that long. Yes it has. Donna says, how often do you guys have sex? I'm too embarrassed to tell her the truth. Why does Donna want to know how often we have sex? Just talking. So you want to have sex so that you could have a good answer for Donna? Why do you have to be such a prick? I don't understand. Are you saying that you want to have sex with me, that you miss it? Or are you accusing me of something? Because that's what it feels like. How could you? - I don't understand. - Paul: Is that him? Yeah. Do you think he's sexy? He's a movie star, everyone thinks he's sexy. I think he's repellent. So does my agent. Don't tickle. - I'm not. - That tickles. (sighs) My meeting with him is on Thursday. I have no idea what I'm gonna wear. - It doesn't matter what you wear. - Of course it matters. I have to be sexy. It's all based on whether or not we have chemistry. Paul: Clothes have nothing to do with chemistry. He'll think you're sexy or he won't. You're being naive. I have to put some energy into what... Oww! You stuck your nails into my back. I'm sorry. I was trying not to tickle. Why are you so against me? What? I said it was an accident. No, what you said about my audition, my clothes. I have a deadline. I have to work. That's all. I'll call you tomorrow. The truth should be known. Mom, what's a "lippen section"? It's a procedure they do to make you look thinner. Why? So I can look better, feel better about myself. It's an improvement. I want to tear my skin off. What? I want it to be the same as yours. You're skin's gorgeous. But I like yours. But mine is wrinkled and old and saggy. Why would you want to have skin like that? Mom, they're clean already. A man flirted with me today. He was at the dry cleaner's. You spend too much on dry cleaning. You should hand-wash. Is that really the point? What is the point? Nobody wants my chairs. - Did you try a lot of places? - Just one. Part of me is relieved. I think deep down I just want to keep them. Why does it make you mad? Because you're not nine. - Oh! - You need to make a living. That's probably why you don't want to sleep with me. First of all, you got that bladder infection. Then you had that yeast infection. Oh, God! You make me sound so appealing. Why don't you just admit you're not attracted to me anymore? I'm still attracted to you. (scoffs) I am. (door squeals) - Hi. - Hi. Annie: Mom's getting cut up now? - In surgery? - Pretty soon. Do you want to know what she did the other day? What? She was taking me to my date with Lorraine. She got into the car and tried to drive but forgot to turn the car on. - She's a mess. - Annie: Like what do you mean? She's totally out of it. Like what do you mean? It's a choice. She goes through life in a daze so she won't have to deal with reality. And what's reality? Reality is what is. It's like the facts of your life. Mom doesn't like the facts of her life so she tunes them out. Annie: What's wrong with her life? Nothing, if you consider that she has one. (chuckles) She's not alive? Never mind. I'll see you in recovery. It'll be a piece of cake. What kind... mocha? (chuckles) God, I can't believe I just said that. He's not interested in me. He's probably married. And no offense, Mom, but this man will be seeing your fat. - Yeah, but you know. - There's no "yeah, but." It's not like he'll be seeing you in a bathing suit. He'll be seeing your yellow, puffy, lumpy fat. (both laugh) Right. He probably dates 20-year-olds. Elizabeth: Yeah, probably. So how are you and Paul doing? I don't know. He won't give me a break. Mom: He's withholding. Why do you say that? He knows what you need. He won't give it to you. He doesn't have the patience for my insecurities. That's so manipulative. It's as if he wants you feeling uneasy. - Doctor: Okay. - Oh, here we go. - See you later. - I hope so. - Good luck on your audition. - Thanks. If Kevin McCabe doesn't like you, he's a fag. Bye, Mom. - Kevin: That was outstanding. - Woman: It's so good to meet. - Kevin: You did a fantastic job. - Woman: You were so funny. Kevin: What a pro! Woman: Thank you for coming. - Kevin: We'll keep in touch. - Woman: We'll be talking to you. You're not leaving town are you? Kevin: No, she's not going anywhere. She's staying right here. - Bye. - Thanks again. Elizabeth, are you ready? - Yes. - Come on in. He was great with actors. Everyone thought he was great. It was a great experience. I heard it was a great movie. - Great. - Great. Did I say "great" a lot? I guess I'm just a little nervous. Nervous is cute. So Elizabeth, what do you think is sexy? Umm... Sunset walks and candlelight dinners. What kind of sex do you have with your boyfriend? You heard me. That's private. Kevin: You're right. Forgive me. I was just just trying to get a feel for what you find sexy. Woman: Why don't we try reading the scene? Let's do this, okay? Okay. Director: What we need here is hot. You two are about to rip each other's clothes off. Okay? Okay. Gotcha. - Ready? - Yeah. How do you know they'll find us? Maybe we'll be hiding here for the rest... No, no... hotter, hotter. Seduce him. How do you know they'll find us? Maybe we'll be hiding here for the rest of our lives. Would that be so bad? - Depends. - Depends on what? On what we'll be doing... while we're hiding. What if we did this? (whispers) Don't be scared of me. Remember, I'm a stock broker, not a movie star and you want to fuck me more than you've ever wanted to fuck anyone in your life. - Okay, thanks. - Director: Okay? Let's take it from "depends on what we'll be doing." It depends on what we'll be doing while we're hiding. What if we did this? Maddy, come here. I want to put sun-screen on you. Jessie, you too. You're gonna burn. Should I put some on? Lucky you, you don't need sun-screen. That's right, you're lucky. Why don't I need sun-screen? 'Cause your skin can't burn, it's already brown. It's so incredible what your mother did. She must be a saint. She did it for herself. She was lonely. Still, it's so much work. I don't know anyone who would adopt a kid at that age. She saved that girl's life. She does do a lot for her. - Okay. - Okay. Maddy: Look, Mommy, look at me. That's nice, honey. That's good. That's so good. Is she all right? She's playing. Oh. She can hold her breath a long time. Yeah, she just wants our attention. Annie? Annie! Stop it. What! That's not funny. You made us nervous. Sorry. It was definitely the hardest thing I've ever done. But I felt like I really accomplished something. I asked for the epidural when I wasn't even dilated. I didn't mind the pain. I felt like a different person when it was over. If I could tolerate that, I could tolerate anything. - Donna: You made it. - Hey, guys. - Hi, sweetie. - Hi, Daddy. I had no idea your brave wife did natural childbirth. - She's phobic about medication. - Donna: (laughs) That's not why. They sell wrapping paper already made, you know? This is handmade wrapping paper. Let's go visit Mom. She's still in recovery. We'll go later. I want to be there first thing. We have to wait for Bill to get back. Where is he? He went to help Donna get a stereo. - I want to go now. - No, later. You're not the boss of me. I am too, when Mom's not here. Fuck you. Fuck you. (phone rings) Hello. Oh, hi. Is she out yet? Hi, Mama. Is it over? Yeah. - How do you feel? - Nauseous. I hurt so much. I never should have done this. How are we doing, Jane? I might throw up. It hurts too much. You're gonna feel better soon. We're gonna have to keep your mom here a couple of days. Because she's nauseous? She needs IV fluids for the dehydration which resulted from fluid shifts that occurred during the surgery. It's not uncommon. I did... I'm happy to tell you... remove 10 pounds of fat. I think you'll be very pleased. You're welcome. I thought it was supposed to be outpatient. Supposedly, it's not that big a deal. Lots of patients have to stay over. It sucks because Mom said the nurses don't want to pay attention to her because she had cosmetic surgery. Her doctor's gorgeous. Mom's lying there and you're looking at her doctor? It's not like I can't do two things at once. Still. There's no still. Thank you. This food looks disgusting. I think it looks good. That's so weird. He should be home by now. I know, yeah... Don't worry, I'm sure everything is fine. He probably just went to do some errands. I'm sure he'll be home soon. That's awful about your mom. Okay, take care. - What's wrong with her mom? - I don't know. Let's go. But I want to stay with Mommy. You can't, Annie. We'll come back tomorrow. Then I want to go home. You can't do that either. We're going over to my house. I want to sleep in my own room. I'll sleep there with you if you want. - You will? - Sure. Can we get ice cream? You just ate an enormous lunch. But I'm still hungry. You're not going to understand this now, but being a fat teenager would not be a fun thing. Elizabeth: God, leave her alone. Just like Mom. Nobody wants to take control. Were you a fat teenager? - She was the Homecoming Queen. - What's that? Don't listen to what she's saying. She doesn't know what she's talking about. I do too. You should see what this kid eats. What are you staring at? She seems so indifferent sometimes. I think if Jessie and Maddy weren't so close I wouldn't hang out with her as much. Did she buy an expensive stereo? Mid-range. Where'd you go after you dropped her off? Had to wash the car. I'm really worried about Mom. I'm sure she'll be fine. How do you know? I don't. I guess it's just what you say. Wow! Bill: Oops! Why don't you just fucking stick a knife in my back? It was an accident. - This is the second time. - It was on the floor. I was working on it. I'm sorry. I'm distracted. I had a horrible day at work. I'm really sorry. Why, what happened at work? Arturo basically stole my commission again. You should tell that guy to fuck off. I can't. Why not? He takes advantage of you. You don't understand. What don't I understand? You don't stick up for yourself. Sometimes, that's not the priority. - What's more important than that? - Keeping my job. - You're the manager. - And Arturo is the boss' nephew. Still. What? You can't just run around telling people to fuck off. Oh yeah? Fuck off. You've got a lot of nerve telling me how to act at work when you haven't had a job since I met you. You were suppose to contribute once Maddy went to school. I'm trying to sell my art, Bill. Fuck your art! You stepped on this on purpose. (gasps) - Hi. - Hi. You can't sleep on that pillow. Why not? She's got 5,000. That's one you can sleep on. I don't think Michelle likes me. Oh, honey... Michelle just doesn't like herself. Elizabeth: Did you have breakfast yet? No. When were they suppose to come? I saw them walking around with trays an hour ago. Excuse me... Hey! - Want me to get you something? - No, I'll wait. You guys should go. It's a nice day. I was gonna take Annie to Lorraine's but maybe we should cancel and stay with you. Yeah, maybe we should stay with you. No way, go have your date. I have an appointment but I'll go another day. Get out of here. I get to watch trash TV. All right. Ouch! Sorry. Bye. Just think, 10 pounds of fat! Hey, so did you get that job? I don't know. My agent hasn't called me back. Bye. Michelle: When I was a kid you sold some of my artwork here. Oh, I didn't work here then. I know. I'm just saying... Anyway, this one has little ducks on it. Oh, look at the little ducks. This one's... What is that one? It looks like a little... it looks like a little turd. It's not a turd. It's a rose. Ah, good. I don't know how to tell you this, but nobody is going to buy handmade wrapping paper. It's too expensive. Well, it's for people who don't really care about money. But that's absurd, isn't it? Listen, mister, this shit is pretty. Then I suggest you try someplace else. - Thank you. - Okay, fine. If you don't like it, it's your loss. Get out of my store. - Asshole. - Freak. That little bitch! (bell rings) Hi, I'd like to apply for the job. No way! Why not? You look like my mom. If I haven't developed pictures before, will somebody train me? - I will. - Don't look at me like that. - You said I look like your mom. - My mom's cute. Can I have this job or not? Whom do I have to talk to? My dad owns this place. Aren't you gonna give me a smile? If I'm gonna give you the job... - You're hired. - Thanks. Are you sure your mom said it was okay to do this? Yeah. My mom didn't let me get my hair straightened until I was 15. Do you know your real mom, Annie? - You mean my birth mom? - Yeah. She couldn't take care of me because she was a crack head. Man... that's a lot to grow up with. Well, my older sisters have it hard too. They didn't know their dad anymore. He's not even a drug addict. And Elizabeth... she's an actress but can't get good parts because she needs better muscles. And my other sister has it hard too because her husband wants her to get a better job and stop making hobbies. Guess what, Annie? You've got it harder. Why, because I'm fat? Because you're Black. But Mom's rich. That doesn't make any difference. Do you know the one about the kid who had the Black mother and the Jewish father? Should you be going around telling Jewish jokes? Why not? I don't know. Because people might get mad. I'm Jewish. You are? I think so. Oh. Well, go ahead. So the kid goes up to his mom and says, "Am I Black or am I Jewish?" And the mom says, "Why do you want to know?" And the kid says, "There's this bike that I want and I don't know whether to bargain them down or steal it." Don't you have a sense of humor? (phone rings) I'll be back. This has to stay on for 20 minutes. Okay, whatever you say. Why didn't you tell me you were coming in? I have a lunch in 10 minutes. - I brought you something. - What's it for? I'm regifting. Just kidding. - This is so cool. - My sister makes them. She wants to sell them so I'm helping her. Plus, you're always buying me things. I love it, thank you. I know I shouldn't just pop in but I hadn't heard from you. It's not going any farther. What did they say? They said you were great but not quite right. I can't believe it. They told me I blew them away. I'm sure they were impressed with you. They just want to keep looking. - I'm shocked. - Don't take it personally. Should I? I just said not to. I wasn't going to until you said that. What did they say about me? I want to know. They said you were great. Come on! They said you weren't quite right. More. They said... you weren't sexy. They said I wasn't sexy? Kevin McCabe is a weasel. Who is it that actually said I wasn't sexy? Did they use those words? - Was it the director or... - Elizabeth? Who the hell knows? Who cares? I can't do this anymore. - I just can't. - Be positive. You're in a movie that just about to open. I play the neighbor. I have two scenes. You're in the poster. You know how many people would kill for that? Paul: I think you're sexy. - Can you get me a job? - I can have sex with you. Don't joke. This is hideous. The profession is hideous. Didn't he go out with Rosie Campbell? She's not pretty. What? I have to work. You don't have a lot of sympathy for me. Since I chose this profession, I shouldn't feel bad when I get rejected? This is so boring. Boring? Elizabeth, it's not personal. Maybe you should date an actor or something. Someone who goes through the same things as you. You don't want to see me anymore? I don't think I can give you what you want. What is it that you think I want? You want a girlfriend. Someone you can talk about your upper arms with. That's so mean. (sighs) - What happened to your hair? - Do you like it? - Lorraine: It's cute, isn't it? - Yeah. - Did you do this? - Her mother said it was okay. No way she said it was okay. She's eight. - Don't look at me. - Who am I suppose to look at? - You were taking care of her. - She said it was okay. I trusted her. Pull it in... and then out and then press in. Hey, Splooge! Splooge! The pictures ready yet? You probably splooged all over them, didn't you? You like the one of Jennifer topless, don't you? Was that before or after her boob job? Real perceptive for "cock boy." Fuck you. One-hour photo boy said fuck you. Some of us have to work, dickwad. Work? Does that include splooging all over pictures of my girlfriend? I didn't look at them. I didn't splooge on them. I hate you. Yeah, sure. Hey, assholes, you forgot to pay me. (laughs) Idiots. I really worry about Annie if I died. You're not gonna die. You're gonna have a flat stomach. No, but one day, if I die before I'm really old. I got two daughters, but I don't know. One of them is really fucked up, and the other one isn't married. I think about the things Annie will have to face in her life... and I just want to cry. She's lucky to have you. She's not lucky. She's entitled. Every child's entitled to a mother. This is coming along fine. I'm gonna send the nurse in to change the dressing. - Thanks. - Okay. Jane, you're gonna be fine. And you're gonna look great. - Hello. - He just flirted with me. You're deluded. I'm not kidding. I think he might like me. What are you, 14? Why couldn't he be interested in me? The guy is your liposuction doctor. Leave it at that. - Don't be so negative. - God, this is depressing me. - (door opens) - I gotta go. - Bye. - Goodbye. Where've you been? - What do you mean? - It's 9:00 and you didn't call. I told you I went to the movies with Jay. You didn't tell me anything. You forgot. You forgot. I got a job. It pays $8 an hour. What is it? I work at a one-hour photo. There were no toll-booths in the area? Hey, I took a job. Happy? Did you take it so you could talk to me like that? I took the job because you wanted me to work. Now I'm working. - Good for you. - Good for you! (groans) Jesus! Nurse! Nurse, I know it's only lipo, but would somebody please come and help me? (sobbing) $10,000 fucking dollars and I'm laying here on the fucking floor. Some nurse came by after about 15 minutes and she was rude. That infuriates me. I wish you'd called me. I couldn't move. Does your doctor know what he's doing? It seems like it. He says I can go home in a few more days. Aw, I'd give anything to take a shit. Is your insurance paying for this? No, I'm going broke. Listen... you will take care of Annie when I die, right? Mom, you already know that. I hope nothing happens to you because Michelle's not really an option. I'll say. What about Paul? How would he feel about it? Why are you smoking? Paul and I broke up. What is his problem? Why do you assume it's his problem? Maybe it's my problem. You don't have any problems. You think I'm perfect? I think you're lovely and amazing. I'm narcissistic. - You are not. - It makes Paul sick. He makes you feel bad about yourself. I felt bad about myself long before I met him. Well, if he loved you he'd make you realize how wonderful you are. Forget it, Mom. I saw an old man with a tube coming out of his throat. I can barely look at you. - Mom, it's an improvement! - Mom: It is not an improvement. I loved your hair. When are you coming home? Soon. Why'd you have to come here in the first place? Elizabeth, take Annie somewhere else. Do something fun. Come on, Annie, let's go. Bye, Mom. And buy her a hat. - How many came out? - All 36. Thanks. Jesus, you'd think they'd send these to a better lab. So... what does your husband do? He's a personal sound engineer. What the hell is that? He installs stereos for rich people. You're kidding. I need a CD player. Could he get me a deal? Why should he get you a deal? Because I'm his wife's boss. Good point. Those guys that came in here the other day... they paid me back. It's cool. - I'm shocked. - They're all right. They were just showing off in front of you. I see... You have a lot of friends? Oh yeah. You could say... you know, kind of a cult thing. Oh yeah. I see. Do you have a lot of friends? No actually, I think people are too self-involved. Don't they know how cute you are? I think I'm too old to be cute. No way, you're pretty cute. (giggles) This girl has it harder than this girl. Why? Look at her hair. She can't get a job with it like this. Of course she can. She has an Afro, that's all. She looks like a clown. No she doesn't. She looks fine. What are you doing, a survey? Oh, hi. Hi. We gotta go. Come on, Annie. Wait a minute. - Hold on. Not so fast. - What? What? It wasn't my fault. The director had final say. - He did? - Yeah, I loved you. Couldn't you tell? I got a boner, for Christ's sake. - Well, it's a style. - What's your name? Annie. Hi Annie, I'm Kevin. I like your hair. Elizabeth: She's my little sister. That is a great organization. Good for you. Listen, that part in the movie... you shouldn't stress about shit like that. - I know. - You want to get a drink? - How about dinner? - I can't. You can take me to Lorraine's. Please? A way of saying I'm sorry you didn't get the part. Who did? Rosie Campbell... it wasn't my decision. Bartender: I need to see some I.D. He's 22, I'll vouch for him. Bartender: When were you born? What do you want? I'll have a scotch on the rocks. I'll have a glass of merlot, please. My first wife had no idea how to handle it. She couldn't understand why I had to go away on location. She hated my whole profession. That's how Paul seemed. He thought it was a waste of time for me to care about how I look. I wish! They don't get it. He acted as if I have a choice. There is no choice. Are you one of those actresses who don't eat? I never eat, ever. In fact, I'm dead. - You're killing me. - Yeah. So... I like to make things and paint things, like... - I paint too. - You do? Wow! But you were saying... Just small things like little plates and bud vases. Stuff like that. Wrapping paper was just a new idea that I'm not going to pursue. Not exactly a can't-live-without item. - I draw. - Oh yeah? I want to do CD covers one day. But I don't think I'm that good. Oh! I love animals. I have a sort of personal animal shelter. Really? Are you kidding me? Because I have this cat and it shits on everything. - I was about to give it to the pound. - I only have dogs. Couldn't you take a cat? She's great. You'll love her. She shits on everything. That's at my house. Maybe he wouldn't do that at your house. She's probably doing it because she's angry. Who cares? Am I supposed to care about my cat's feelings? I do care. I do. I was kidding. I love him. I feel like I'm doing a very bad thing. I've had a drink before. When you have as many zits as I do you're entitled to get hammered once in a while. You don't have that many zits. I bet you had no zits when you were in high school. You're right. I had an excellent complexion. And I bet you were popular. I was the Homecoming Queen. (chuckles) Fuck you, you're kidding, right? No. Cool, I'm out with the Homecoming Queen. Where do you get your dogs? Sometimes I'll find one that someone's abandoned. Or the pound'll call me if they have one that needs a home. That kind of thing. You must have a tremendous amount of pet hair on your furniture. Promise me, never get a boob job. Is that advice? A compliment? Just promise me. Why would you care? Because you're an original. An original what... asshole? - An original beauty. - I am not. You are. Hey, I could be your own personal lint roller. Ouch! - Ouch! - Michelle: What? Oh! - This is gorgeous. - Thanks. I'd buy this from you in a second. Really? (Michelle giggles) (whistle blows) Lorraine: I'm gonna take that class even though I hear the teacher's boring. You already have too many credits. I could never keep up with so many classes. I don't know. I'm used to it. Annie? Annie! You can't do that. You can't play that game. - I was floating. - Didn't you hear me? - No. - You heard me perfectly well. - You were laughing. - It was funny. It was not funny. Come on, out of the pool. Lorraine: No more swimming. Out! Out! What are you looking at? Don't look away, you're the fat girl. - You're the fat girl. - You can't act like that. Feeling guilty about your boyfriend? A little. We broke up. - When? - Two days ago. A long mourning period, I see. (giggles) You didn't have to ditch him so you could sleep with me. He probably wouldn't have minded. How's that? A movie star. Different role. Go on. You don't know how many boyfriends will forgive you for cheating with somebody famous. And when two famous people cheat with each other they cancel each other out. I see. (giggles) Come on, you look good. Do I? Do you... think that I am sexy person? No, I think you're a cow. Let me ask you something, I've been seeing this trainer and I think he doesn't know his shit. Look at my stomach. I told him I want it narrow and hard. Instead, I'm getting wide and pumped. What do you think? No, it's fine. If I asked you to do something weird, would you maybe do it? Oh, absolutely. I'm gonna stand there... and you're gonna tell me everything that's wrong with me. You can also say what's good with me. But I hardly know you. I mean about my looks, my body, my face. Whoa, no way, girlie. Are you kidding? No. You don't understand. You'd be doing me a favor. - No. - I won't be mad at you. - Not a chance. - I want to hear your opinion. I won't get upset. This is some kind of trick. Why do you want me to do this? I just do. Good and bad? Your opinion. Yeah, well, hmm... You got nice hips, nice flat stomach, sexy belly button. You're definitely on the skinny side, kind of bony. Okay, the bush is big. - (giggles) - Big bush. It could use a little trim. You could trim the trim. (chuckles) This is so weird. Okay... I like your breasts. One's a little bigger than the other but they're really pretty. Perfect from the front. Turn to the side. They're a little droopy from the side. Nice nipples though. Good color. You're bowlegged. It seems like your knees are thicker than... Turn around. In a perfect world, your ass would be rounder. But overall, your body is in good proportion. You've got smooth skin, kind of pale. You could use some sun. You have a really sweet smile, very charming. Your teeth are yellow, though. I should give you the number of my dentist. You have pretty eyes... although one of them is bigger than the other. Your hair is flat and thin, but you've got a real nice neck. It's long and smooth, happens to smell good too. What about my arms? - Your arms? - Yes, my arms. I don't know, they seem fine. Oh, yeah, they're a little loose right at the top. They could be a little more toned. - They're kind of flabby. - Is that it? You want more? Is there more? No, I think that's probably about it. Okay. Thank you. - You're not upset? - No. - You sure? - I'm positive. Should I get you something to eat? - No thanks. - Tea? No, I've got to pick up my little sister. Was this some sort of sick fetish thing? No. No. I like your dress too. Thanks. Bye. You sure you're not mad? I'm not mad. Oh good! Because that was sort of refreshing. She pretended she was dead in the pool, which scared the hell out of me and everyone else. Then she teased some poor girl. Honestly, I didn't know how to handle it. She has no sense of humor. I'm sorry. I know she's going through a lot. Her mom's in the hospital and everything. So, shall I bring her by on Friday? I don't think so. I don't think I can take this kind of thing on. This kind of thing? It's not like she doesn't have any real sisters. When I signed up to be a Big Sister I thought I would get somebody poor from a bad family. This is sort of weird. Why is it weird? She needs to have a relationship with somebody who's Black. Well, this Black somebody doesn't want to do it anymore. Did you have dinner with that gross guy? Yeah. - You're wearing a real Baldesaro? - Yeah, who is that? I don't know. I think he's good. Are they giving it to you? No, lending it to me for the premiere. - Who are you taking? - I thought I'd take Annie. Can I come? I don't have to work today. Okay. You'll have to meet us there. - I can do that. - Good. What do you do? You develop pictures? Yeah, it's fun. You went to college. I mean, how much can you make? Eight bucks an hour. And your boss is 17? So? He's probably got a huge crush on you. How are you and Bill? I don't know why he ever married me. You were pregnant. Where's Mom? She's in the hospital. How could she be worse? I don't understand. Is she gonna be all right? Your mother's blood cultures came back positive indicating she's bacteremic. - She's in a coma. - Yeah. She's most definitely not in a coma. The infection is causing confusion and delirium, that's all. I don't believe this. She had liposuction. Doctor: Whenever you do surgery there is a risk. We're giving her strong antibiotics for an infection. This is bullshit. - I'm sorry. - You'd better be. - Elizabeth, stop this. - Stop what? It's probably because the nurses didn't pay attention to her. Elizabeth, your mother is going to recover. Toward that end, the less noise and the less stress, the better. Excuse me. Asshole! Bill: It's not your fault, babe. I did tell her her stomach was flabby. (sobbing) You didn't tell her to have an operation. Everybody has these operations. - No, they don't. - Yes, they do. - That means they should? - I don't give a shit if they should. I just know my mother is really sick. And you're acting like you don't care. You care, Daddy. Of course I care. But the doctor said she'd be fine. Wow! - Where are you going? - I don't know. It looks amazing. It's very flattering. Are you kidding? This looks disgusting. Did he leave me anything else? No, just this. He picked it out especially for you. Are you sure you wouldn't like to try it with this? No, please no. Hi, is Jordan home? Oh, uh, yeah. He just got home from school. Can I help you with something? No, I'm a friend of his. Oh, come on in. Thanks. - (knocking) - # Turn the pain... # Jordan, there's someone here to see you. - What's your name? - Michelle. Bye, Mom. Bye. # When you're just another waiter... # This is so incredibly humiliating. Why? Look at my room. I know how old you are. Is it okay that I came here? Are you depressed? - Is it me? - No, my mom's really sick. Was she old? No, she had a cosmetic surgery operation and her fluid shifted and I don't know... she's got some infection. In her nose? No, it wasn't a nose job. It was her stomach. - My dad is dead. - He is? I thought he owned the one-hour photo. That's my stepdad. My real dad died when I was 10. 10? That's horrible. I miss him a lot. My mom and I don't even talk about him. I don't really have a dad either. I mean he's alive but we have no relationship. Doesn't he want one? I guess not. I don't think he ever really liked us. Or me, I should say, he never liked me. He has to like you. He's your dad. (chuckles) Sometimes I think I used to be nicer. You're so nice. I have a problem with anger. Do you want to stay over for dinner? My mom's cooking Chicken Payard. (giggles) Are you kidding? Did you see the way she looked at me? I have to go somewhere with my sister anyway. Will you meet me later? Spend the night with me? How? We could pick a place, I don't know. - A hotel or... - No. My daughter would freak. I've never spent the night away from her. She's with her dad. That's true. But... Okay. I gotta get my bag. - You were great. - Thanks. - I loved the movie. - I'm so glad. Who are your dates? These are my sisters, Michelle and Annie. Are you proud of your sister? - I didn't have a big part. - Don't tell him that. It's true. You just saw it. - You made it. - Hey. No, this is mine. How did I do? Hey, you guys, this is Cindy, my agent. These are my sisters, Michelle and Annie. Hi, nice to meet you. I didn't know you had two sisters. I've told you a million times. - You did? - Yeah. Are you upset your part was cut down? Yeah, a little, you know. I only had two scenes so... You know how hard I pushed to get you that part? It's better than nothing. Courtney, hi. You should tell her to fuck off. I gave her one of your chairs. She liked it. Really? You think she liked it? Yeah. Woman: Which one of you is older? (in unison) She is. What do you do? You're thin enough to be an actress. I'm an artist. I thought you worked at a one-hour photo. Woman: That's an interesting job. I take my pictures to a one-hour photo. It takes about an hour. Yeah. What are you going to be doing next? I'm not sure really. I'm getting offered some stuff. Annie: I'm bored. We told you you'd be bored. - Annie: I am. - Elizabeth: Want to eat something? The food is weird. I want to go home. All right. - But it's early. - What do you want me to do? Annie, can't you just be patient? I'm tired. I wouldn't mind going home. I'm worried about Mom. - I don't want to go yet. - Well, stay. - Really? - If you want to. You don't think it'd be weird? No, kind of, but... no, stay. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Have fun. - Bye. You're too young to be wearing all that make-up. My butt itches. Look at the poor pup. So dirty. Come on. Annie: You have enough dogs. Come on, puppy. - (dog growls) - Hey, baby. Elizabeth: Aah! (dog growls) Help! Someone please help! Please help! Michelle: It's strange because it's not like me. But I didn't mind the pain. I mean I minded, but it was worth it. I guess you women have a raw deal. Oh no, no. Childbirth is incredible. What I went through made me a stronger person. I'll always feel really proud of that. I didn't scream for the drugs. And that's saying a lot. - So... - Man: Excuse us. Oh, yeah. Cindy, hi, how are you? Do I know you? I'm Michelle. Elizabeth's sister. Oh, right. You know... you're sister is a neurotic mess. My sister is insecure. Is that a crime? Fuck off! # Down to the store tonight # # Can you still see my face # # Next to my eyes? # You're going to have to get a series of rabies injections. What made you go after a strange dog like that? He looked lost. - Hi. - Hi. I've been waiting so long, I didn't think you would come. I'm sorry, I can't go to a motel with you. No, a hotel... someplace nice. I can't. I don't know what we're doing. We're having a relationship. I'm married. I'm old. I've been thinking about you all night. About spending the night with you. It's not gonna happen. Please? Let me be with you. Jordan! - Jordan! - Hmm hmm. - Get out of this car. - Oh. Oh, Mom, you remember Michelle? Hi, I know this looks weird, but it's not what you think. - Michelle's my lover. - Jordan, we're friends. We're not... we're a lot more than friends. Jordan, get out of the car and go to your room. - No. - Now! It's okay. You should go. I can't believe this! What... That's funny, I have that same robe. What? Who cares what kind of robe she's... - Is this some kind of joke to you? - No. I just think you should go inside. (siren blares) God! Officer: License and registration, please. We weren't driving. License and registration, please. Look, my mom... I don't know what she told you but she's crazy, so like... Please step out of the vehicle. Step around to the back of the car. Place your hands on the hood. - You have the right to remain silent. - Are you kidding? - What did she do? - You're handcuffing me? - What did she do? - Statutory rape is illegal. - What? She didn't even rape me. - You have the right... ...to have an attorney present... - We didn't do anything. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand these rights? - Yes. - I wanted to be here. We're in a relationship. Son, please go back into the house. - Michelle: (laughs) - Watch your head. Please don't talk to me like that, Bill. I know what you've been doing. Of course, I know. I'm not an idiot. Don't even threaten me with something like that. It was just a fling. This had nothing to do with Maddy. Did Donna have anything to do with Maddy? You go to hell! (sobs) He wants to take my daughter from me. That's rough. I'd die, you know. She's everything. She's the best thing I ever did. (sobs) Annie, don't forget to brush your teeth. And not just for two seconds, okay? Annie? Annie. Annie! Annie! Annie? My sister's missing. She's only eight. I thought she was in the house with me. (sobbing) No, no, I have no idea where she'd go. You'll be notified by the court if charges are pressed. I think it's broken. Could you let me off here, please? Can I take your order? How many nuggets in a large? 20? How big are they? Umm... Thanks. Annie: I won't finish it all. I just couldn't decide what to order. What are you doing here? I was hungry. Where's Elizabeth? Home. How did you get here? Walked. You walked here by yourself? Yeah. Does Elizabeth know you're here? No. Annie! Hi, it's me. I'm with Annie. No, she's fine, she's fine. McDonald's. Yeah. Okay, okay. All right, bye. Annie, do you have any idea how dangerous this was? Elizabeth is hysterical. Are you going to drink that? No. Don't worry, I'm not gonna finish it. I don't care. Have more. (sighs) I just got arrested. Do you like my straight hair? I do, I really do. I think it looks pretty up like that too. Thanks. Thanks a lot. It's funny, do you ever... wonder what things you might inherit? I mean, you're Mom's kid and everything but you've got different genes. You could inherit all kinds of things that would make you so different from us. No, I mean better. Like your dad, he could be a genius or something. Your mom... who knows what your mom was? My mom was a crack addict. True. But I'm sure she was a lot of other things too. Some of them must be good. Maybe she was a good swimmer. Yeah, exactly. All right, I better call a cab. Maddy. Maddy, come on. I'm gonna take you to Grandma's house, okay? Come on, big girl. Whoa! Michelle: Let's try not to wake up Daddy. Elizabeth: Hey! Dr. Crane. Dr. Crane. Nurse: Jane. Can you see me all right? Yes, I can see you. - Dr. Crane. - How do you feel? Better. You know you've been sleeping for quite some time. What? Who's the president of our country? Dr. Crane. Dr. Crane isn't here. He'll be happy to see you're feeling better. Where is he? I'm sure he's at home. With his wife? I imagine so. Asshole. (phone ringing) (phone continues ringing) - Hello. - Elizabeth, it's Kevin. (yawning) Who? Kevin McCabe. Oh, God. Hi. How did you get this number? From your agent. Not without a fight, though. So what are you doing? Sleeping. Alone? Of course, alone. You're talking funny. I had an accident. What's up? You left your black camisole here. I don't have a black camisole. Oh. Never mind, Elizabeth. I like you. I want to sleep with you again. Thanks. (giggles) So what do you say? How about we get together this weekend? I don't think I can do it this weekend. It's because of what you made me do, isn't it? I knew it was a trick. It's what I said about your teeth. (phone beeps) Kevin, I'm getting another call. I gotta go. Well, all right. - Elizabeth: Thanks for calling. - You're welcome. Hello. Yes. He's paranoid. He's so convinced the tiger's gonna eat him that he can't stop running around. If he'd stay still, the tiger wouldn't know he was there. - It's pathetic. - Yeah. We can go get Mom. This is Annie. She was six here. It was about a year after she came to me. She's adorable. She's gonna be a heartbreaker... or an arm-breaker. God, she loved that jacket. It's so dirty. You know, I have a 10-year-old. She won't even let me shop for her. These are my two older girls. This was taken when we went to the beach. That was a great day, more or less. What's she doing in there? Checkout time is noon. Annie! Michelle: Annie. # You worry on # # Hurting anybody anymore # # You worry on # # Small comfort # # One of us seems not to tremble # # You make a rift inside me # # Every day # # And did he choose to stay? # # I walked the ocean # # Pushing white earth # # You are forgiven # # I open all my doors # # You are forgiven # # What a heart is for # # I am no martyr # # You give me reason # # I try harder # # And wait for a warmer season # # Meanwhile # # You are forgiven # # I hear a soft noise # # Like a sigh # # A singing like a lullaby # # It is my heart # # It is its will # # That blows through # # Where you held me closer # # Where we whispered # # This is # # This is true # # You are forgiven # # I open all my doors # # You are forgiven # # What a heart is for # # I am no martyr but you give me reason # # I try harder # # And wait for a warmer season # # And meanwhile # # You are forgiven # # I open all my doors # # You are forgiven # # What a heart is for # # I am no martyr, you give me reason # # I try harder # # And wait for a warmer season # # And meanwhile # # You are forgiven # # You are # # Forgiven. #
