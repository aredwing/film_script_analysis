Might as well be... a map to Shangri La. Damned if we do...Damned if we don't. I know what you're thinking, Major. It can't be done. Maybe you could. / We've tried everything. Every possible route.Each time we came back fewer. It's impossible...There is no way out of the infection zone. All we can do is survive.Outlive the virus. You'll might as well get used to it, Major.

Now I don't feel so guilty about sleeping with the boss his daughter. No guilt,nothing. Where did you even find that guy? Super Soldier factory? Or what? Are you intimidated? How big is his bike? / Huge. Really? Maybe Duke's wrong. He's keeping us alive this long,we've got to trust him. You don't want to go. You love It,you think your a warrior. I am a warrior. They say a swordsman that never draws his sword..is a true master. They don't know shit about zombies! We had good luck with the SOV Force,So that's where were going. Pick up some more can's.

We can do this easy or hard. Your'e going home, Jude..Home... Yeah. No,Let go! Hey,take your hands of her! I would have come this way too. What's going on? Duke. You're too dangerous, Major. You won't stop.You won't give up! It's been a bind. I know the feeling. You think you're the first? They've been others like you. Plans, weapons. And they all died. You think you're different? You think your better? You didn't listen Major? I won't let any more of them die. I won't let you take any of them. Not one,not any. I can save them. It's not that. What's wrong?
