And Wendy did believe always, even as she left childhood behind and came to have children of her own. There it is, Jane. Second star to the right and straight on to morning. Never Land! The second star to the right Shines in the night for you To tell you that the dream you plan Really can come true The second star to the right Shines with a light that's rare And if it's Never Land you need lts light will lead you there Our story begins in difficult times. England is threatened with war and many men have been asked to leave their families to protect their country. I'll be home before you know it. I promise. Now, now. What's all this? I want to go with you. I need you here to take care of your mom and Danny. Can you do that for me? That's my big girl. - Be safe, Edward. - Look after each other, now. Goodbye, Daddy! I love you! I love you all. Drive off! But the war lasted much longer than anyone could have imagined. Bombs fell from the sky and tore at the very heart of London. Don't cry, son. All aboard! In an effort to protect its children, the government decreed that they all be sent to the countryside for safekeeping. - Goodbye! - Bye-bye! - I love you! - Good luck, sweetie! In times such as these it is no wonder some discard childish things, like Peter Pan and Never Land. What is it, Nanatwo? We don't have time, you silly dog. We have to get this home to Danny. Oh, no! Quick, Nanatwo! Mommy, where's Jane? Don't you worry, Danny. She'll be along. All right, now. Here we go. Into the bomb shelter. Bring the lights up! What is it, girl? Oh, my gosh! Nanatwo, we're not out of the woods yet. We have to get back out there. Look, who's in charge here? Don't be silly. I am! Now, come on! Mommy, I'm scared! I don't like planes and bombs. Is that what it is? For a moment, it sounded like cannons on a pirate ship. You're right! It's Captain Hook! I hear him! He's coming! - Jane! - Jane! Oh, Jane! Where have you been? Why didn't you... - Mother, I'm fine! - Jane, you made it past the pirates! - Daniel, careful! - What's that? What's that? Hey! It's for me, isn't it? Let me see! Let me see! All right! - Happy birthday, Daniel. - Yippee! Socks. Two of 'em. Jane, dear, how very practical. Got them a size large so he can grow into them. Look, Danny. Pan and Hook, see? - Curse you, Peter Pan! - Oh, Mother. I want to hear a Peter Pan story! Nanatwo! All right, then. How about the time Peter and the Lost Boys captured Hook's ship right from under his nose? That's a good one! It was late one misty evening and Hook was sure once again that he'd found Peter's hideout. Hook and his bloodthirsty crew went ashore leaving the Jolly Roger unguarded. That's when Peter Pan arrived! He and the boys slipped aboard and there they found it. Hook's remarkable treasure! Peter told the Lost Boys they'd hide it and Hook would have to hunt them down to get it back. It was all a great game for Peter. And then, from out of the mist, he was there, the evil Captain Hook! A fierce and ferocious sword fight was fast underway. - Give up, boy! - Never! And at that moment, a shimmering magic covered the ship. Tinker Bell! Yes! And the Jolly Roger lifted into the sky as Peter and the boys escaped with the treasure. You've not seen the end of me, Peter Pan! I'll get you for this if it's the last thing I do! So you see, Danny, Hook will never win as long as there's faith, trust and pixie dust. Poppycock! Slow down, you old codfish! Oh, my notebook! - Daniel! - Come on, Jane! We'll beat old Captain Hook together! Daniel, please! I've no time for fun and games. You used to. You got to be the very first Lost Girl ever. That was a long time ago. Yeah. Back when you were fun. Honestly, Mother. I don't know why you fill his head with those silly stories. But they're not silly. They're... Take care of Danny, will you? Go on. I'll be right there. - Yes? - Evacuation, ma'am. Your children are scheduled on the morning train. So soon? But I haven't even told them. The sooner the better, if you ask me. Good night, ma'am. Yes. Good night. Jane, dear. Will you promise me something? Promise you'll watch over Danny, - whatever might happen. - What? You and your brother are going away for a while. Away? But where? All the children are being evacuated to the country. It's so dangerous here. But you'll be safe there, both of you. - I'm not going! I'm staying here! - But, dear, an order has been issued. Every child must go. But Daddy said that I'm supposed to... I know, dear, but you can take care of Danny. Tell him Peter Pan stories. He needs them, Jane, and so do you. Please, dear. Promise me. No! I will not promise! Jane. We'll be together again. - You must have faith. - Faith? Trust? Pixie dust? Those are just words from your stories. They don't mean anything. Yes, they do. Peter Pan says they'll make you fly. Daniel, story time is over! Look! It's a war. Peter Pan isn't real and people don't fly! They do, too! - Oh, come on, Daniel! Grow up! - Jane! It's just a lot of childish nonsense! You're lying! Jane, how could you treat your brother that way? You think you're very grown-up but you have a great deal to learn. I am not a child now I can take care of myself Mustn't let them down now Mustn't let them see me cry I'm fine I'm too tired to listen I'm too old to believe All these childish stories There is no such thing as faith And trust And pixie dust 'Cause I try But it's so hard to believe I try But I can't see what you see I try I don't know if it's going! Is that water pressure up? Peter Pan. Pixie dust. Childish nonsense. Hello, Wendy. My apologies, miss. Curses! Bring her down! Hurry, Smee! Come on, now. Don't fuss. Cast off, ya mangy dogs! Hoist anchor! I'll get you, Peter Pan, if it's the last thing I do. I've got a little surprise for you, Peter Pan. Drop the mainsails! Prepare to drop anchor! This is simply perfect! Yes, Mr Smee, with Wendy as bait we shall lure Peter Pan to his doom! Summon the beast! Yes, sir, Captain. Right away! Oh Yo ho ho, another plan To try to capture Peter Pan Captain Hook's a brilliant man Who else could think of the perfect crime And bumble and fumble it every time Smee! Set the bait! Make no doubt, Smee. That wretched boy will be but a notch in me scabbard. - Only in your dreams, Hook! - Pan! I didn't know a codfish could talk. Did you, Tinker Bell? Blast him! Take your best shot, Captain. Come on! You're gonna have to do better than that, boy! Three strikes and you're out! Come down here, boy. I've a little something for you. A present for me? Aw, you really shouldn't have. Call it a token of me affection. You see, it is a certain friend of yours. Who? Wendy. Wendy? Let her go, Hook, you black hearted scoundrel! You want her? Well, go and get her! I did it. I did it! I can't believe it. I'm free! Free of Peter Pan forever! Mr Smee, who is the most brazen, bold and brilliant buccaneer whoever sailed the briny blue? Blackbeard? Boys? Hook! Hook! Hook! Thank you, thank you. I was good, wasn't I? Did you miss me, Captain? How did you escape the beast? Help... Me! Now, now, stay away! No! No, no, no! No, no! No! Smee! Hang on, Captain. Here I come! Smee! Mr Smee, be a good fellow and fix the plank so I can make you walk it! Aye-aye, Captain! Easy does it, Wendy. You should have seen Hook's face when I... Peter Pan? Well, you're sure not Wendy! Tinker Bell? I get it. I'm dreaming. You're not real. Look out! Pan, you double-crossing pipsqueak! Come back here and fight like a man! Come and get me, you old codfish! Come on. We gotta fly out of here. Wait! What are you doing? If you're not Wendy, who are you? I'm her daughter, Jane! Well, if you're Wendy's daughter, you're gonna love it here! Hey, this is great. You can stay here forever. Help! - She did that on purpose. - Aw, she's just jealous. - All girls get like that around me. - Oh, really? How very nice for you. That was fun, huh? Lost Boys, fall in! Careful! You're going to fall! Sound off! - Slightly! - Nibs! The twins! - Cubby. - And that's Toodles! Boys, this is Jane. She's gonna stay here and be our new mother - and tell us stories. - What do you mean by... - Yay! Stories! - Tell us a story, Jane. Come on! Actually, I'm afraid I'm not very good at telling stories. That's okay. We're not very good at listening to stories. I know. Let's play a game instead. Red rover! Red rover! Nah. Something else. Let's play the "no more hitting Cubby on the head" game. - Hey, how about a treasure hunt? - Good idea! Yeah! A treasure hunt! I hid it really good this time. - You guys will never find it. - Sure we will! - Diamonds and rubies! - Treasure! Treasure! - Diamonds... - Yeah, come on! - Let's go! Let's go! - No! No, no, no, and no! You remind me of someone I know. I have to go home. What's the matter with her? I don't know. She acts kind of like a... Grown-up. I've got to get out of here. Smee! Coming, Captain! Oh, my back! Dear, dear, dear, Captain. A nice massage is just the ticket for you. Now, you just forget about old Peter Pan. Perhaps you're right. All in the past, I say. All in the past. The past. Likes when he stole your treasure. My treasure? And then laughed in your face. Laughed in my face. Or today, for example, tricking that there sea monster into pulling down your pants. Right in front of the crew, too. Right in front of the crew! We've got to find him! Catchy. Smee, listen! Great Scott! No sooner do I rid me self of that cursed crocodile and now this! There, there. He's just a playful little sea urchin is all. I swear, Smee, this is propelling me to delirium. I detest cephalopods. Thank you. Smee! Save me! Oh, you big brute, you! Off with you. Go on, now. Shoo, shoo. And take your arms with you. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. At least the crocodile had manners. Blast that scurvy boy! This is all his fault. Mr Smee, pipe up the crew. We're going ashore to find Peter Pan! Tink, what is she doing? It looks like she's leaving. Half-dozen bananas. Check. Ten coconuts. Check. - Two oars... - Hey, Jane. How come you want to go home so bad? I have to get back to my family. Why? Well, I don't want to talk about it. Why not? If you must know, we had a fight. Why? I told my little brother you weren't real. What? Why? Well, I don't know. But I have to get back and set things right. - Why? - Because! That's why! Well, you know, you can't get home that way. I've got to try. Well, goodbye. It was nice meeting you, Peter Pan. Duty calls. Oh, dear! Oh, no! Whoa! You okay? I just want to go home. Well, you know, the only way out of here is to fly. Come on, I'll show you how. Step softly, you worthless dogs! Set your sights for Peter Pan! Oh, goodness. Haven't we searched the island a thousand times before? I beg your pardon, Mr Smee? I said that searching for Pan is... Fun galore. There'll be no rest until we have that boy in irons. - Hey! - Watch it, Cubby! Oh, no, Peter. I really don't think this will... This is ridiculous. I can't fly! Well, of course you can't, but I can! I guess I'm just smarter than you. I highly doubt that. - Braver. - Right. Stronger! Oh, yeah, that's it. Well, then it must be my good looks. Or maybe you're full of hot air. Hey! Look, anybody can do it. Tink? Yeah! All it takes is faith... Trust. And something else. Pixie dust? That's it! Okay, Tink, let her have it. Tink. Gosh, Tink, if she can't fly home, I guess she'll have to move in with us. Now, that's enough! Odds fish, what's that? - Okay, Jane. - Don't even think about it. Ready or not... - I got her! - I got her! - I got her! - I got her! I got her! I thought you said you got her. How will I ever get back home? So the girl can't fly, yet she wants to go home. Smee, do you know what this means? Six more weeks of winter? No, you imbecile. We'll get me treasure and the boy. - Hey, what's this? - Oh, give that back. It's my list! Things to do, places to be. Important things! That stuff's no fun. - No wonder you can't fly. - Give it back, Peter. Slightly, catch! - Keep away from Jane! - I got it! - I got it! - You boys are horrid! - Come on, over here! - You're ripping it! Come on! Why don't you guys ever throw to me? No, stop it! This isn't funny! I've got it! This is just a game to you, isn't it? Well, I'm tired of playing. Gosh, Jane, we didn't mean to make you mad. Grow up. You did so. You're just a bunch of silly, ridiculous children. No, no, leave me alone! I don't believe in any of this! And I especially don't believe in fairies! Goodbye! Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance! Peter? I think there's something wrong with Tinker Bell. I need you here to take care of your mom and Danny. Can you do that for me? That's my big girl. I love you! Looks kind of bad. Kind of bad? Kind of? Oh, it's hopeless! Poor little Tinker Bell! Hey, put a cork in it! - What? - What did she say, Peter? If we don't get Jane to believe in fairies, Tink's light's gonna go out. Well, let's just go and make her believe! Hang on a minute. You can't just make somebody believe in fairies. - But we believe. - Yeah, it ain't hard for us. That's it! We gotta make Jane one of us! But she's a girl! You want to help Tink, don't ya? We gotta do it! Don't worry, Tink. We'll save you. Stay where you are! Please, go right ahead. Run me through. You'll be doing me a favour. All right. I give up. What's your problem? All I've ever wanted was to get away from this dreadful place and home to my dear, sweet mother. But blast it all! Peter stole my treasure and my men would mutiny if I so much as tried to leave without it. So here I am, stuck in this absurd place. My sources tell me you wish to return home as well. You got that right. I guess we're in the same boat. The same boat! - That's it! - What's it? I'll give you passage home on my ship and you can help me recover my treasure. Don't you see? The treasure's useless to Peter. He's not sensible like you and I. He's just a boy who'll never grow up. Tell me about it. And, really, what other choice do you have? It's not as though you could fly home. Well, I suppose. If it is rightfully yours. And if it's really no use to Peter... Splendid, splendid! Wait! You must swear not to harm Peter. Me? Actually harm Peter Pan? Perish the thought! It's all a game, you see. I shan't harm him. You have my word. "I, Captain James Hook, do hereby swear "not to harm a single hair on Peter Pan's head." You see? Ironclad, unbreakable. Leave the light on, Mommy. Your baby boy's coming home. Now, when you've located the treasure just give this a wee toot. You're doing the right thing, my dear. I'm your only way home. Jane! Jane, come on back! - Jane! - Jane? Jane! - Jane! - Jane! Peter! Peter Pan! There you are! I've been looking all over for... - I... - No, no, no. You. I'm sorry for wrecking your book. We want to make it up to you. We want you to feel like... Well, like you're one of us. We'll do anything for you. Honest. Anything? Anything at all! You just name it. Well, why don't we play a game like maybe treasure hunt! Treasure hunt? That's a great idea! But you'll have to think like a Lost Boy. And have fun like a Lost Boy! Tell me what to do. - Well, to be one of us... - Yes? - There are some things to know. - What's that? We like to dream all day And then at night we play We swing on limbs of trees Till we wake up the bees These are the things we Lost Boys do We swing from rope to rope We have no use for soap With open mouths we chomp On mud pies from the swamp And then we top it off With pudding from a trough These are the things we Lost Boys do We're rolling in dirt And we won't change our shirt We're marching around To see what makes a sound - Dare you to throw that rock! - I'll get a triple skip! Dare you to explore that cave! I'll have an overnight trip! And if you're feeling scared I'll have my friends right there These are the things we Lost Boys do The treasure! I found... Now, when you reach the treasure, just give this a wee toot. Hey, Jane, you did it! Lost Boys! Jane found the treasure in Dead Man's Cave! - Yahoo! - The treasure! Attention! Fall in! In honour of your downright unbelievable skill at finding hidden treasures, I now proclaim you, Jane, a Lost Boy! I mean a Lost Girl. Me? The very first Lost Girl? What's the matter? Don't you want to be? Oh, yes. I'd like that very much, Peter. - Let's hear it for Jane! - Yippee! Now that you're one of us feel free to sing along We are so proud of you that you can do no wrong And we don't even care if you pull on our hair These are the things Lost Boys... These are the things that Lost Girls... These are the things we love to... No, wait! No! The treasure is ours! - Hey! - Let me go! It's time for you to meet your maker, Peter Pan! Stop it! Please! Sorry. No can do. And thank you, milady. I couldn't have done it without you. - Jane? - I never meant... Oh, my. Have we let the kitty out of the bag? No, wait! You said no one would get hurt. You gave your word! And Captain Hook is a man of his word. I promised I wouldn't harm a single hair on his head. And this is the one I won't harm! Here. You keep it. The rest of him is mine! I didn't do it, Peter! I never agreed to this. You're a traitor, Jane. You lied to me! And because you don't believe in fairies, Tink's light is going out! Tinker Bell? No. Peter, I... I'll save you, Peter! I will! My dear, no one can save him now! Tinker Bell! Tink! Tink! Tinker Bell. It's true. I can finally see it Now I have to believe No. This is all my fault. All those precious stories All the world is made of faith And trust I'm so sorry. And pixie dust So I'll try 'Cause I finally believe I'll try 'Cause I can see what you see I'll try To fly Tinker Bell? This is wonderful! Wait until Peter... Oh, my gosh. Peter. - Aye. Keel haul the brats! - He's fish food now! Hey, he's like a piata! Look at him, Smee. He's nothing but a child. And I loathe children. Cut him down. Any last words, boy? - Let the Lost Boys go. - Oh, they'll go. Right after you, one by one, off the end of the plank! Be brave, lads. Don't let 'em see you cry. Say your prayers, Peter Pan. Not so fast, you old codfish, or you'll have to answer to me. - Yippee! - Yay! Jane? Good heavens! Run! Run for your lives! It's... A little girl. Tinker Bell! You're alive! And look, Captain, a fairy, too. Don't just stand there, you fools. Get the girl! Destroy them young tykes! Smee! I got her, Captain. I got her. Watch your head. I've got you now... Gimme! Mine! Mine! Big shiny! Get her off! Get her off me! Captain? I've had just about enough of your childish games! Jane, look out! Give up, girl. Never! Don't you see, Hook? You'll never win. Not as long as there is faith, trust and pixie dust. Odd bodkins! Unbelievable! Mere child's play. Gotcha! Looks like I've got the upper hook now. Game's over, Hook. I win! Hey, Captain, you forgot your anchor. Abandon ship! Help me, please! You know the rules, Hook. A good captain always goes down with his ship. I don't want to be a good captain! Look! Smee! The codfish! The codfish! All right! Let's hear it for Jane! The one and only Lost Girl! Thank you. Thank you. All right! What's wrong, Peter? You can fly now. You can go home. - I can go home. - But... - But... - But... But... - We'll miss you. - Yeah. A lot. And I'll miss you. All of you. But there's someone back home who needs me. And besides, now I've got great stories to tell him and they'll all be about Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. Yeah! All right! Hey, in that case... Mademoiselle, it would be my pleasure to escort you back to London. The pleasure will be all mine, good sir. Hey! Well, it's a long way home. Give me your best shot, Tink. Oh, my gosh! Mother. Mother! Darling, what's wrong? - Mommy! - What is it? You were right. He is most remarkable. - Who, dear? - Oh, Mother, I'm so sorry. If only I'd listened to you. I had a bad dream. Did you, now? Was it Hook again? Were those pirates up to their old tricks again? Hey! What's going on? I know how to take care of that old codfish. - We can do it together, Danny. - We can? - The two of us. - Really? I saw him, you know. Captain Hook kidnapped me. Stuffed me into an old dirty bag, he did. He took me off to Never Land and tried to feed me to a giant octopus. - Wow! - There were pirates everywhere. And Tinker Bell was so beautiful. You saw Tinker Bell? But her light almost went out. You have to be very careful. Wendy? Hello, Peter. You changed. Not really. Not ever. Hello, Tinker Bell. Oh, Tink. Madam. Goodbye, Wendy. Goodbye, Peter. Wow, look at him! It's Peter Pan! I'll always believe in you, Peter Pan. - Here we go, then. - Thanks, mate. I appreciate it. Daddy? - Daddy! - Edward! Daddy's home! Come on, Tink. Let's go home.
