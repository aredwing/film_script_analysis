You have a visitor. Rita. This is your mail Because it's got your name on it, OK? My mail is sometimes addressed to "occupant" Because, Max, I am the fucking occupant of my place. You, on the other hand, Are no longer an occupant. Is this sinking in? Get your shit out of my place! Rita, please don't do this to me here, OK? Excuse me, Max. Um, sorry if I'm disturbing you guys, But...Do I look like a warehouse, huh? Because this guy here, he thinks I do. He won't get his stuff out of my place. You should look at some of the shit he holds onto. Rita. Come here. Give me a break, OK? Just cut me some slack on some storage space. No. You're out of slacks, Max. No more slacks for you. Shh! Shh. Don't you shh! I'm not one of your goddamn buddies. I'm sick of you treating me this way. Gun! Aah! Get down! Get down! Ay, Max! Don't move! Put the gun down or he's dead!

What are you talking about, man? Hey! Motherfucker! That was probably stupid. Yeah, well, somebody had to get the gun out Of the schmuck's ear, didn't they? Come on. Got him? Yeah. So, computer is good for something after all, huh? Ay, dios mio. Ay, dios mio. Ay, Santa Maria... Are you OK, Rita? Don't touch me, Max. I don't need this shit in my life, you know? You know, Max, I think it is really beautiful The way you two have stayed so close. [speaking Spanish] Next time, shoot him. The next detective Who allows an armed bail bondsman in here Does traffic for 2 months! I'm dead serious! Way to go, sly. Now that you're all warmed up, How about room 4? It's, uh... She's a jogger. She caught a stray bullet on ocean drive-- Kathryn McQuean. Ocean drive? Nobody gets shot on ocean drive. Too ritzy. Ah, you caught me. I'm lying because I like to make shit up. Come on. Room 4. She's waiting. No, no, no. Whatever you do, Do not let Hollenbach out of that office. Order him something to eat. He'd stay in a burning building For a free meal. I'll be back in about 30 minutes, OK? I have to go now. Bye. Miss McQuean? Yes. Why don't you take a seat? I'm detective Kirkpatrick, metro Dade homicide. Need to ask you a few questions About this shooting. I'd like to help you, But I can't even tell you If there was a shooting. [telephone rings] [ring ring] [ring ring] Kirkpatrick. Hold on, please. It's for you. Thanks. Hello? Amy? I need my notes on the Juantorena settlement Typed up for my meeting with Hollenbach. You did it already? Thank you. You are a lifesaver. Can you hold on a second? Would you mind not smoking that? Sure. Thanks. Can you just send them over, And I'll proof them here? OK. Bye. So, um...Ahem. Miss McQuean, I'm a little bit confused. My report here Indicates that there were several witnesses-- All I know is a window broke, And I got cut by flying glass. I saw a car zoom away, if that's any help. [telephone rings] Kirkpatrick. [ring] Kirkpatrick. Man: Hey, who's on this line? Who's this? Man: This is the records department. I'm sorry. Sorry. It's the fax machine. Thanks. Sorry for all the interruptions-- Phones ringing, faxes coming in. [chuckles] It's, um... For you... Again. Can I borrow your pen? So, what did you do here, move in? I've been waiting here for over an hour. I can't just put my life on hold For your red tape. My red tape? That's a laugh, Considering your people invented red tape. My people? Yeah. It says right here you're a lawyer, right? Is that a problem? Only if you like seeing criminals put behind bars. You're right. It would be so much easier If we could just lock people up Without a trial, Wouldn't it? Did I say that? You people all say that. Maybe it's because You people work for the bad guys. Actually, I do civil law, not criminal law. But if you're looking for bad guys, We could start right here. What's that supposed to mean? Just that Florida law enforcement Has set a world record In bribery and corruption. A world record, huh? Know what they call a Florida cop In a 3-piece suit? The defendant. Do you know what they call 50 lawyers At the bottom of the ocean? A good start. You know that one. If you're done with your report, Can I go now? You stay here one more minute, I'm going to start charging you rent. [beep] If you keep me another minute, I start billing you for my time. Wouldn't surprise me. [ring ring] [ring ring] Kirkpatrick. Woman: Is Kate McQuean still there? She's not here. Do you know where she went? Why don't you try the bottom of the ocean? Oh, Maria, I'll be with you soon, OK? Oh, OK sure. Good morning, Lisa. How are you? You made some friends today? Yeah. Good. Messages? Hollenbach's waiting in your office. Thanks. Welcome. It's about time. I had to cancel my lunch with Donny Trump. Sorry. I got hung up at police headquarters For almost 2 hours. Why don't you do what I do? Plead the fifth, You're out of there in 5 minutes. Thanks for the tip. No charge. Counselor, why are we confining ourselves To this very stuffy office When we could be at the beach Frolicking in our bikinis, Or in your case, a thong? I believe we wrapped up the Juantorena case A fortnight ago. Well, it just got unwrapped... Last week... When I learned that you helped your client Hide some community property That I can claim for my client. I have no idea what you're referring to. I'm talking about the aspen ski house you hid With your client's brother... And the coral gables condo you hid with his sister... And the plane you hid with his mother. Counselor, there is no ski house, There is no condo, And his mother borrowed the plane. His mother's senile. That's it. She forgot to come back. Counselor, these charges Are scurrilous and baseless, And may I say between us, Tete--tete, That this would take A minimum of 2 years to prove, And he would transfer title To new relatives. As far as this humble counselor's concerned, The most I would receive Is a $200 slap on the wrist. You're right. I'm not going to waste our time Dragging us into family court. Yeah, that's... Ridiculous. But, uh, maritime court? Federal maritime court? That's another story. Maritime court? Doesn't that have something to do With cruise ships, right? Actually, it has to do with all ships... Like this one. Never heard of the Tortuga. I didn't say the name. Lucky guess? Listen, Hollenbach, the law of the sea Is simple--and federal. I don't care if you hid the registry of this vessel In Panama or Podunk. I want the title signed over to my client in 48 hours, Or you're gonna end up in a federal prison so deep That by the time you get out, You're gonna need a walker to chase ambulances. Are we clear? You know, counselor... You're very unattractive when you're threatening. Gotcha. What's our status? We just crossed over the underwater cable line. How long? Hard to say. 36 hours, maybe 48. We have to search For a junction box down there. What about our Miami problem? I'll take care of it myself. Ah, yes. Ilya Kazak, The mighty KGB, Who missed a hit On a lousy divorce lawyer. No wonder your country folded. I'll show you how it's done. Get out of the way. Go. Let someone who doesn't eat borscht Show you how to use a computer. Give me the grid. Take it down. Dade county. Bully and search for target. There. You see? She'll be dead by dinner. Max, um, there's something I really think you should see. Max! What's going on? Make a hole. Let him in. There you go. Take a peek. Is that your stuff? I guess so. I think you pissed her off, Max. Definitely pissed her off. [shouting in Spanish] Max. It amazes me How much shit a man can accumulate. You fucked up. Thanks, Lieutenant. Rub it in, why don't you? Not that. You forgot to get the lawyer lady To sign her statement. She left her pager, too. Come on. I'm off duty. You work my shift, it's like the toilet-- It ain't over till the paperwork's done. I've dealt with enough crazy women for one day. You obviously got me confused With someone who gives a rat's ass. Signed statement on my desk, by tonight. You want to watch headline news with me? [meow] No? It's not going to kill you. Aah! [gasping] Oh, my god. Out of my way! Move! It's OK. I got you. I got you. I want it straight, and I want it now. Hitman: The girl, she's still alive. She's alive? You sure? Idiot. So, Juantorena, Miss McQuean is still alive. I'm getting a little bored With your petty incompetence. Fuck what you think. You tap phones for a living. I tap banks. Without me, You'd still be stuck in Havana Pulling bananas out of your ass. You think you can do this by yourself? What are you going to do, shoot me? Yes. Hey, you. Do you know how to do everything he did? Da. Good. I want the land team ready and armed To move out in 10 minutes. Yes, sir. [sirens] It's Nancy, forensics. What have you got, Nancy? So far, all I got is a blast pattern And a strong smell of marzipan. Marzipan? Jesus. Semtex? Or c-4. The blast was shaped in a military configuration To blow through the apartment And kill anything in its path. These guys are not fooling around, Max. Hey, who'd we draw for detail? You got b and g. Good. Why don't you go back to the station And see what's going on? Boys. Man: Hi, Max. Whoo! You smell like you fell in a sewer. Check it out yet? No. We just got here, too. Top of the stairs on the right. I want you to keep her away from the windows. I'm going to go stash the jeep And check the back door. Be back in a minute. Have you downloaded The background information on the target? I can tell you What size pantyhose she wears. We know more about her than she does. Any food? Pop tarts and beef jerky. It's Max's fault that we got night duty. That's right. I say he springs for the domino's. He's definitely springing. I'm not springing. I got about $10 to my name. Hey, guys, I'll buy the pizza. Call Caffe Romano over on ocean. I have an account there. Yeah, why not? All right, you two guys, I need 2 eyes on the front, You on the back, bean. Lights out on the back porch. Got it. So...How do you feel? Like my life just exploded. What is this place, motel hell? Well, it used to be a crack house Until the county took it over. Now we use it for witness protection. You mean targets? I didn't say that. No. Forensics did, on the radio. What is Semtex, detective? It's a plastic explosive... Used mostly by the military And some... Terrorists. I'll tell you this, Kate, Whoever's after you, They're real pros. I suppose I should take that as a compliment. It would be embarrassing To be killed by an amateur. I got you some dry clothes here. Shower's right behind you If you want to clean up. You get some rest. So what happens in the morning? We figure out who's trying to kill you. 20 minutes, OK? Yeah. All right. To go--pepperonis with everything, Extra cheese, four times! Under Kate McQuean account. How does she eat so much and stay so skinny? Colonel, we've got her. She just used her credit card. It's a delivery going to... [gunfire and explosions on TV] Hey, man, move your car! My pizzas are getting cold. Da, and so are you. [imitating trumpet] Hey, babe, If you were domino's, I'd get a discount. If I were domino's, you'd still be alive. Oh! The door's open. How many in there? There are 3 more targets. One on the ground floor at the back.... One on the second... And one at the end of the hall. Rosa: Where is target one? He's in a small room by the stairs. Now would be a good time to catch him. Ohh... [flushing] Aah...Oh. That's better. What did you do? To the heat sensor? Nothing. Kazak: One of them just disappeared. OK, you mook, you better not be Touching my frigging pizza. Oh, shit! Aah! Fuck! Kazak: Wait. Target 3 is moving. Bean, g, talk to me. G, answer me. Bean, what the hell's going on? Shit. [turns hair dryer on] Farm boy: Where is the target? Kazak: Stand by, I'm scanning. Where is he? Wait. He's in front of you! [sobbing] Shit. Come on. Let's go! Oh, god! Come on, quick. Kazak: Come back. The police will be here any minute. Coo. [honking] They're out of there. They? When did she become a they? She's with a cop, and he's very good. He killed our whole goddamn team. Stop. Those are police cars. We'll be safe with them. That was supposed to be a safe house. Only cops know about it. Are you saying we can't trust the cops? We can only trust the cops that I know. And right now, I don't know how many of them are left alive. [knocking] Kirkpatrick. Line 2. I got it! Tell me you got the woman, Max. What the hell is going on? What's going on? Bean and g are dead. God. Where the hell are you? Not on the phone. What are you saying? Somebody knows every move we make. I ain't saying shit till I know who I can trust. You listen up, Max. I'm not fucking around! You're bringing her in now! You should call the suits. We don't need the goddamn suits, Kirkpatrick! Got it. Kirkpatrick. Nice Irish name for our cop. Let's see what he's made of. Ah, here we go. One life about to end. If there's a chance anybody's dirty, We need to call in the feds. Who said anything about dirty cops? Max, give us an hour. Where? Where I used to go on Friday nights. This is bullshit! If you live through this, Max, you're fucking fired! You just make sure you bring the feds, You understand, Louis? Don't worry, buddy. Watch your 6. How long to police headquarters? 5 minutes. Go south. [honking] [telephone rings] Forensics. Jodi, it's Max. Hey, don fucking Johnson. I need a favor, OK? I never lend money to family. I need a make on a shell. Like I need my beauty sleep. What do you got? Center fire shell, Copper wash with a brass primer And a red surround. Looks like a 12-gauge, but it's marked "33." Ever heard of a "33"? No such number. There's no such zone. You got a phantom cartridge there, cuz. Well, a phantom cartridge blew away 2 of my crew. I-I'm sorry, Max. Uh, look, The arms world's like the jersey shore. It throws up new shit every day. I'll run it right now. Call me in an hour? Yeah. Where are you taking me? My partner used to moonlight here As a security guard. Hey, don't worry. Everything's going to be all right. I wish I could believe that. Lieutenant Meyerson. Baker. FBI. Congratulations. This is detective Aragon. He'll be taking you to the pickup point. [speaking Spanish] [shouting in Spanish] Hey... Come on. The word for tonight is "inconspicuous," All right? [tires screeching] Where the hell are you taking us? I'll tell you when we get there. Just have your guy stay close. You OK? Kirkpatrick: This the guy? Agent baker. Where's the woman? Show me your I.D. Y'all don't have to screw with me, son. Your partner's taken care of all that. Let me see the badge. OK? Now, where is she? Cruise the perimeter. Make sure this is the only way in and out. Howdy, ma'am. Are you OK? I'm with the FBI. You're safe now. It's OK. Detective Aragon, ride in the other car. Louis: I'll be right behind you, Max. [coughing] Why don't you just put that thing out? Seat belts for safety. Right. Hold the wheel, will you? Yeah. [cursing in Russian] Oh, shit! Come on! Let's go! Unh. [groans] Come on, come on! Stay down! If it wasn't for you, I'd remember where I parked my c-- Hey! What the hell just happened back there? I got my best friend killed, that's what. How is it your fault? I'm the one who called in the FBI, And that wasn't the FBI. Who were they, then? I don't know. I did everything I could. I checked their I.D.'s. These guys are perfect. [speaking Russian] Kazak: Fail again, I'll kill you myself. Now get in. You got any cash? I have a credit card. This is a good place to hole up. Looks big and busy, And they won't remember faces. Stay right here. Idiots. They use a credit card again. Typical Americans. You got them? Raleigh Hotel. 1775 Collins avenue. 10 minutes from here, colonel. [ringing] Forensics. It's me. Listen. What if this 33 on the bullet Isn't numbers? What if it's alphabet letters, Like Greek or Hebrew? You're not as stupid as you look. Give me some time. I'll call you back. Great. They gave us the wrong goddamn key! It doesn't need brawn. [beep beep] Finesse. Oh, no, you don't. No time for rest. I need some answers. Come on, did you hear me? Get up. I need your help. We got to figure this out. OK, OK, OK. OK. All right, listen. You're a lawyer, right? Yes. You got a lot of clients? A lot of cases? This has to be connected to one of your cases, right? It's possible. Maybe you sent somebody away who's back for revenge. Max, I don't do criminal law. I do civil law. Small claims, green cards, Mom-and-pop grocery stores. Nobody gets killed over that. Oh, no? 3 of my friends were just killed over "that," Remember? That's 3 families wake up tomorrow Without a goddamn father! And I have to live with that. So do I. So, genius, You ever piss off the KGB? KGB? Look, the Russian letter for "z" looks like a "3," So "33" is "zz," Which means zapedny zahvoet. It means "death to the west." They were based in Cuba to strike western targets-- They being KGB "away" teams. Go on. They were the navy s.E.A.L.S. Of the spy world-- Wet works, black bag jobs, Electronic surveillance. Very versatile. If it was bad, they did it. Fuck "did." they're doing. And they're right on my ass. Avoid leaving any electronic footprints. They can reach into your home and pick your nose for you. Remember the Russian spy ships we used to read about? These guys used to work on them. They are heavy into electronic surveillance. That's why their federal I.D.'s were so perfect. They must've done it with computers. Look, never mind, Max. You got family here. If you need a hand, Most of us are armed and dangerous. Thanks, cuz. You're a lifesaver, Even without the artillery. KGB... Computers... They found the safe house. How the hell did they find the safe house? The phone lines. [ring] [ring] [ring] Quarter of a million... Cash. What? For the girl. Never fucking happen. Half a million. Just walk away. Kate, come on! We got to get moving! These bastards are on the phone lines! Phone lines... Eeny meeny miny moe. Let's see if you have your ears on now, You son of a bitch. He's using the hotel phone. I'll trace it back to the other party. Stop-n-shop. [ring] I know you're out there listening, You motherfucker. Fuck you calling motherfucker? You'll never get the girl, you understand? I already got your girl, earl. I fucked her last night, And she was good! Big fucking mistake, killing my crew. Big fucking mistake. Want to know why? 'cause I'm going to come back And get every last one of you. That's an empty threat, Mr. Kirkpatrick. You have no idea who we are. Why not drop the bullshit American accent then? I...Beg your pardon? Man, fuck you, Fuck whoever else on the line. Bring your ass here. Do svedanya, asshole. Dos for what? Do svedanya, asshole? Dos for-- man, fuck you! Clever bastard! You in? I've isolated the floor security, Not the room. Well, do them all! Come on, let's go. What's going on? Get back. Fuck finesse. 2 more blocks, we're there. He said, "do svedanya, asshole." He knows about the Russian connection. I wonder what else that scumbag knows. Locate that woman. What's that smell? Pig shit. Trailer over there is hauling hogs. Heh. Be right back. [beep] [squeals] [oink oink] [rapid beeping] They've activated their cell phone. Imbeciles! It's like painting a bull's-eye On their ass. I've triangulated their position. They're on route 1, heading north. We'll have them by midnight. Ha ha! Pig shit's sure gonna hit the fan, huh? Ha ha ha ha! OK. I know you've been looking out for me, And somewhere in there I forgot to say thanks. So thank you. All right, gomer, wake up! Hey! Open the truck! Come on, hurry up! Let's go! All right. OK. Don't push! Hello, pigs. Where the hell are they? Where the hell are who? The cop and the girl! [off-the-hook beeping] Good morning. Hi. How'd you sleep? Never better. Hey, listen. Do you have any Russian clients? Why? 'cause this here's a Russian shell. You got any Russian cases? No. Cuban, Hispanic-- Cuban sounds Russian to me. I'd have to get into my office PC And run a list. Forget about that. We're not going back to Miami. Maybe we don't have to. Colonel, we just hit the jackpot. Kirkpatrick is a satisfied customer Of car trac, u.S.A. Car trac? Vehicle tracking system for paranoid consumers. The police locate missing cars with it. Can we access it? It's an encrypted system on a national satellite. It'll take a little while. Then do it. You got 5 minutes, then we're out of here. You'll move the IBMs. Uh, yeah. I thought there was-- You're not paid to think, You're paid to do what I say. Hello! May I help you? Actually, I was in yesterday, and... Adam was helping me. I--I was? OK. Fair enough. I'll be over in the diner, Adam. Hi. Hi. I thought I'd be in better hands with you. Oh, yeah. So, what are you doing over there? Nothing. Just fiddling with my joystick. Fiddling with your joystick? [pencils clatter] Adam... Adam? Do any of these have a communications package? Yes, uh, this unit here Has a hayes-compatible 28-baud fax... Something... Do you--uh, Are you interested in hardware? Or is it more software? Hardware. I was hoping to demo your unit. W-w-well... I'd have to boot up first. Well, why don't you? [radio chatter in Russian] Colonel Kazak, We've just located the junction box. The divers are in the water now. Good. With any luck, By tonight the targets will all be dead, And we'll all be rich. Colonel, she's using a modem To download files from her office machine. If she stays on long enough, I can trace it back to her current location. You're not going to buy anything here, are you? No. I'm sorry. I'm just using you. Th-that's OK. We got to go. I've got one minute. You got anything? No...No... Do you have something or not? No...No... No...No... Wait a minute. This could be it. This guy-- Emilio Juantorena. This thing fax? Yeah, you bet. Jodi can run this guy's name To see if he's got a rap sheet. Come on. We're out of here. Thanks, Adam. You're the best. So who is this Cuban guy? He slammed his wife into a brick wall And kept a dental surgeon busy For a year. He get charged? Yes, but he found a bargaining chip. The s & l he owned ran a major wire fraud. He and his lawyer, Hollenbach, Rolled over and took immunity. What's his beef with you? He didn't buy immunity from divorce Or a fair property settlement. He's got it all in some boat I've-- Wait. What's the boat worth? 200,000. Why? Why, Max? The guy on the phone, back at the hotel? He offered me half a million just to give you up. It was him! Adam! Adam. Aah...Aah... Speak! What the hell is that? Shit! It's the radiator. Great. Well, well. I believe we've found the bastard Who's been helping those idiots Put 2 and 2 together. It's the radiator. I don't know. It blew. It must've overheated. Could you get out here right now? There's an extra 50 in it for you If you can get out here sooner. I'm into the car trac system. Got him!

You guys look like a bunch of juvenile delinquents. We were 17. Kids...In jersey. I tell you, You got that much testosterone... And that little idea what to do with it... Looking like a hood works till you figure it out. So how'd you get from there to being a cop? Well, my father was a cop, Brother-in-law's a cop... My cousin Jodi's a cop. Family business.

You go back there! Stay down! Aah! Max! Uhh! [gasping] Uh! There. I see them now. Move! Move! Let me go! Max! Let's go! Let's go! [man speaking Russian on radio] Kazak to away team. Report in now. We got the girl. The woman? What about the cop? He fell off the train. He's probably dead. Kazak: Whatever you do, don't harm her...For now. We need to interrogate her And find out if anyone else knows our situation. Bring her to me at once. Yes, sir. Where are you, relative to the Tortuga? About 40 minutes due east of Downs Bay. Good. Then you should be back shortly. You're coming with me. [rings] [telephone rings] [ring] Recording of Kazak: Hello. You've reached the workplace Of detective Kirkpatrick's meddling relative. Cousin Jodi cannot come to the phone right now, But if you'd like to leave a message, Contact your nearest psychic. [gunshot] Do svedanya to you, asshole. [Russian radio chatter] Ahh, miss McQuean! We haven't been formally introduced. Welcome to the Tortuga. When I ran the KGB out of Cuba, I helped some very politically incorrect characters Hide billions of dollars In various free-world banks, But I kept the account numbers. Magic numbers. All I had to do Was break the bank codes Used for wire transfers... And help myself! "Downs Bay." Numbers are so beautiful, Don't you think so, miss McQuean?
