One of them lost a front flipper. - Where did they show up? - 10 miles offshore. They were following a shoal of sprats. They were in the water for 20 hours... caught in a net. Poor things. - Can you identify them?? - Yes. - Where are the others? - My son said there were. Where are they? You have something for me, Esteban? Nothing. - Are you sure? - Are you a biologist or a cop? You should come with an apology rather than an attitude. My son was spitting blood. She broke his nose.. My wife wants to report it. She'd better not come round here again. Wait, Alex. Alex. What are you looking at? Enough already. That's it, take her away. Too many endagered species as it is.

To surgery. To see the butchering. He doesn't butcher people he fixes them. He does tits and noses for money but he prefers the other stuff . - Such as? - NI don't know, deformities... Guys born with eleven fingers. - My dad takes off the extra one. - And eats it. I'm serious. It's not a joke. You said he didn't butcher bodies. Never mind. You don't get it.

Don't touch it. What do you know about the species in my house? Stop the car. I'm sure this was the spot. This is where i got pregnant with Alex. We still lived in Buenos Aires. I was afraid somebody would see us. I was worried somebody would drive by and see us. - It's ridiculous. - What is? Being worried about what other people think. They'd ask:, "Is it a boy or a girl". It's the first thing they ask in the clinic. When did she stop the corticoid? Two weeks ago. You know what will happen? - What? - She'll masculinize. Everything will change. Her body, her cycles. She'll stop developing as a woman. That's enough. - Have you thought about what I said? - I'm not having sex with you. - Why notr? - Because you're too young. - So what? - And we've only just met. That's why I'll never fell for somebody like you. Not I for you. You say you're older than me but you repeat every word I say... You're not normal. You're different and you know it. Why do people stare at you? Why? What's wrong with you? Stay. Come here. - I don't have anything. - I like it.

It wont hurt him Drink up Don't drink if you don't want to. - It's not a big deal. - Yes its a big deal. We moved to be away from certain kinds of people. And now we're all sitting round the same table . O yes... Give it to me baby. Take this and this. Again, again. - You've done it already. - How d'you know? I can tell. With my cousin. Five times. I didn't want to at first. I didn't like it. He said we weren't going all the way. Just half way. We ended up going all the way It didn't hurt much. Put this on Alex. I'll put the spare matress here. On the floor. Or Alex goes home. Go to sleep, It's late. Give it to me baby.... I have a special bottle of liquor. I'm going to bed. We're all going to bed. Don't. I'll be right back. - What's the matter - i found them together. - Who? - Alex and lvaro. - What do you mean? - Together. - Doing what? - Don't know, I walked away... On top - What? - She was on top. I don't understand. She was fucking the boy up the ass. Clear enough? It was bound to hapen. That's enough Kraken. We knew this would happen. She can't stay a woman. What do you mean "normal"? - What? - You said normal. I didn't say anything. Don't build your hopes up. She'll never be a woman, even if a surgeon cuts off what she doesn't need. When did you tell them? That's why they're here? I just wanted them to meet her. I'm not crazy. You talk to him. What if seh wants to? Sorry. - What do you want? Are you a doctor. - No. A journalist? I have a daughter. A son... I've seen you before. You've been here before, right? Yes. I don't usually drink but it will do us both good. Your son? Adopted. We're doing the paperwork to adopt a girl. The perfect family. - How old is Alex? - 15. Want to see me at her age? If you don't mind... That's me at 12. keep it. Give it to Alex. - Did you always know? - That I wasn't a woman? I still wonder how my life would've been without the operation. How was your transformation from amn to woman ? When I was 16 I started taking testosterone At 17 I had surgery. That same year I changed my name... I met my wife six months later. The rest of my life is sleeping in that bed. What if I got it all wrong? By letting her choose? Do you know what my earliest memories are? Medical examinations. I rhought I was so horrible when I was born that I had to have five operations before my first birthday. That's what they call "normalization". It's not surgery. It's castration. Making her afraid of her own body... is the worst thing you can do to your child. What are you doing? - You're looking at me differently. - You're older. Then you could've told me why these people came to visit. I didn't know. - Are you coming with me? - No, I want to walk for a while. Alex! Alex. I don't understand. - You're not? - I'm both. But that's impossible. You tell me what is and isn't possible? But do you like boys or girls? I don't know. Sorry about what I did to you. You didn't do anything. I'm not upset... I liked it. - Really? - Yes. - So did I. - You did? - Then let's finish it. - Never with you! - Why? - I want something else. - I want something else too. - Oh, yeah? What do you want What do you want? - Alex, it'll be our secret. - Liar. - I wont tell enybody. - Get off. Go tell everybody I'm a monster! Alex! Where's Alex? What are you doing here? I told you not to come here. - Where is she? - Beat it, Vando. Your father's in real trouble. Motor lancha. Alex! Alex! Wait up Wait, wait . Come on Come on over here. Don't worry. Calm down. We're not going to hurt you. Take it easy. Please! Quiet. We're not gonna hurt you. Calm down Let go of me! Please! Bitch! Take it easy, stay still!

Come here. Let go of me! Stay away from my daughter? - Enough. You'll kill him. - Enough? You say it's enough? You're just like them. Worse! Stay away from my son... Just agree to the surgery. It's not too late. You can't hide her for the rest of her life. Hide her? - You think she's a freak? - No! We came here to stop hearing every idiot's opinion. I've had enough. I've had enough pills... enough operations. I want things to stay the same. She was diagnosed 2 months before being born. They wanted to film the birth. For "medical interest",and to present the case to the ethics council. We said no, to all of it. Alex was born blue... She took 40 seconds to start breathing. Then, they wanted to operate. they said the only after-effect... would be the scar. Suli was scarred. I convinced her not to do anything. She was perfect... From the moment I set eyes on her. Perfect. Forget her. She's too much for you. I can't leave yet. I want to speak to him. We have to leave. Go fetch your son. You'll catch a cold. - May I? - Yes. - I thought you didn't drink? - You told me I have to drink. - Do you like me? - You're my son. Let's cut the crap and talk seriously. kind of. What about me? Do you like me? Do you like what I do? I'd give anything to have your talent. And... me.. am I talented? No. Maybe... Do you think one day? Do you think that I... No, I don't. I don't get it. It wasn't always this way. - What way? - When did I stop interest you? It was a bad idea to come. Your mother is right. We're leaving - When? - Now. At dawn. - No. I can't leave yet. - Why not? Do you like Alex? Finally good news. I was afraid you were a fag. What are you doing? looking after you. You can't look after me for ever. Until you can choose. - What? - Whatever you want. What if there isn't a decision to make? I've finished it. - Did they hurt you? - No. Did you go to the police? No, that's your decision. We'll press charges if you want, but it's your decision. Everybody'll find out. Let them. - Have a good trip. - Thanks. I'll be right back. Will I see you again? I don't think so. Look. I never imagined I'd fall for someone like you. But it happened. - Me too. - No. No? You're after something else. No. What do you regret the most? Not seeing me again or not having seen it? lvaro! Do you want to see? lvaro! Hurry up, we'll miss the boat.
