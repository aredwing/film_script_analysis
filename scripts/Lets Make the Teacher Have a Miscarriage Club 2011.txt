'A teacher told me off for taking a picture on open day.' 'l only wanted a photo of my child.' 'Is that too difficult for a childless teacher to understand?' Fumiho's mother. It was your class? She wanted a face shot of Fumiho, and cut in between me and the students during class. She disrupted your class?! Nothing matters but her child. See all her notes criticizing me? Wow, a real monster of a mom! Felt a kick? The baby is worried about his mommy. Anxious? What if my child grows up to be like my students. He won't. He's got a decent mother. Ready? Aw, they turned over! Fumiho. That baldy teacher? Yeah, he thinks he's hiding his bald head. No way. It's obvious. I know! He's as bald as a cue ball. How can he even think that he's hiding it? But he does. It's too pathetic. You're telling me. On windy days his hair flies up. I guess it would. Hey, no playing. Tucky, are you going to marry Chii-chan? Don't call her that! How do you know anyway? You told us in class. - Yeah. - I did? - You did. - Me? - Yes. - No, I didn't. But you did. Do you mind leaving? Huh? Why do we have to leave? Just leave and figure it out yourself. That'll be your homework. Yes, life is nothing but homework. Ms. Sawako sure does have a good point. Ms. Sawako is really scary. You're a good student, Mizuki. - Mr. Takimoto. - Yeah? You're bothering me. Ouch, that really hurt. Mr. Takimoto. You called? Yes, I'm coming. - What is it? - I don't get this. I never was good in my studies. Let's see. You try solving it first. I'll get that. Oh, thank you. I don't think he'd make a good father. Ms. Sawako. Are you pregnant? Yes, I am. Yah, pregnant! Four months! Let's begin homeroom. Maternity leave in the middle of a semester? This is the first year in junior high for your students! It's totally absurd! Was this a temporary job till you had a child? Oh no, that's not the case. Fumiho is sensitive and worried about not fitting in at school. Guidelines for handling complaints Fumiho is sensitiveand worried about not fitting in at school. Guidelines for handling complaints Guidelines for handling complaints I told you that during consultation, or did you forget? I told you that during consultation, or did you forget? Ms. Sawako. It's time for curriculum meeting. I'm sorry. I have a meeting. You may think she doesn't need looking after But take time with her. Yes, of course, I will. Good-bye. Don't forget. Here. You saved me. She usually goes on for two hours non-stop. You may need this. It covers you against legal costs when sued by unreasonable parents. Is this really necessary? Our hands are tied. We can't fight back against students or their parents. We need legal institutions to help us. 500 yen a month... What's this? Here, Fumiho. I wonder if Sawako had sex. Are you being funny? Of course she did, she's pregnant. Just imagine. Sawako... had sex. Isn't that gross? I know what you mean. It is... ...gross. Let's-Make-the-Teacher Have-a-Miscarriage-Club Hello. This is Sawako at Tachibana junior high school. Is this Mizuki's mother I am talking to? I'm sorry this is the Oda's. You've got the wrong number. No one by that name here. This is Oda. Oh, I see. No one by that name here. This is Oda. Oh, I see. - I'm sorry. - No problem. Who are you trying to call? Mizuki's mother. But, the phone number seems to have changed. Have you tried their home phone number yet? The number you dialed is not available. See? [Solubility Curve for Alum.] We're in class now. Ms. Sawako. About the solubility... The solubility curve. The temperature is shown on the y-axis, right. No, the x-axis. Weren't you listening? Do you have the sheet I handed out? See here. This is the solubility curve. The x-axis shows temperature. The x-axis is the horizontal axis, alright. Meanwhile the y-axis... ...shows the amount that will dissolve in 100 grams of water. See, as the temperature rises... ...so does the solubility. The amount... ...that will dissolve. Then from this point... Ms. Sawako. Your lunch. Thank you. So, in the solubility curve... Is that your favorite actor? What's so attractive? Umm, his face. His face? - He's cool. - Yeah, really. No, no, no. I hate that beard. But his beard is what makes him so cool. You're crazy! But his beard is what makes him so cool. You're crazy! You're crazy! - He's definitely cool. - Whatever. You're wrong. - He's definitely cool. - Whatever. You're wrong. You really like him? I guess... I prefer smooth. What do you mean? You know that new drama on TV? I like the younger brother. The younger one? Definitely not Mr. Beardy there. What's wrong? Ms. Sawako. Are you all right? Gross! Yes? How's Ms. Sawako? Morning sickness? Umm, hard to say. When do they become human beings? After 8 weeks, they're called fetuses. So, it's already a human? Yes. She's in her fourth month. That's when the baby begins to kick. We won't be changing seats in homeroom today. Wasn't that totally gross? I mean, she's not the type to throw up. I can imagine Mr. Takimoto throwing up all day. But Ms. Sawako? That's just not her. It wasn't morning sickness that made me throw up. There was something mixed in the soup that I ate. Why are you telling us this? Why do you think? I understand you wanting to cause trouble for the teacher. I was once a junior high school student. But... ...there are limits as to what you are allowed. If anyone knows anything, write me a note. It's not us. I received a note saying that maybe it was. Who told on us? That's not important. That person may be lying. That's right. True. It's not definite proof. It may not be you. Then let us go. I'm going to ask you a question. Answer, and I'll let you go. If you got pregnant. You have a baby that you dearly love. And you're looking forward to its birth. But then... ...someone plays a prank on you... ...and the baby dies. Now then... ...what would you do? Akina. I would sue. Shion. Is the same answer okay? I'd sue. Mao. Me, too. Fumiho. I don't know. Mizuki. I'd pretend it never existed. It died before it was born. That's the same as not existing. What would you do, Ms. Sawako? I would kill... ...I would kill whoever killed my baby. A teacher isn't supposed to say stuff like that. I'm a woman before a teacher. You're women before students. Prank or not, women never forgive anyone who hurts their children. Mrs. Machimura. Wait! Give me back my child! Wait! How dare you accuse them of being guilty! Shame on you! - Please. - It's just morning sickness! And you blame these girls for it? Unbelievable! How will you take responsibility if Fumiho decides to take her life? Let's go out in the hall. I had the students write me anonymous notes about who did it. Mizuki, Aki, Shion, Mao, Fumiho Fumiho's name is on this. Mizuki, Aki, Shion, Mao, Fumiho Fumiho's name is on this. Fumiho is a kind-hearted child. The problem is, you don't know that! - That one? - No, I think that one. Fumiho's mom is gross, too. And super rude! 'How dare you accuse them of being guilty!' - Are you guilty? - I'm guilty. - You guilty? - Yeah, I'm guilty. - Are you guilty? - Are you? Are you? Are you? Are you? Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Those that laughed are just as guilty! Ms. Sawako is very serious and earnest about teaching. But it seems she stepped over the line, and I am truly sorry. And because of her condition... I mean pregnancy... ...she was perhaps more nervous than usual. And this could have caused this misunderstanding. We apologize for the physical and mental pains the children have received. Our apologies. We apologize for the physical and mental pains the children have received. Our apologies. You're awfully quiet. Apologize! We instruct teachers on a daily basis not to use corporal punishment. We will be more thorough and give clearer instructions... ...so that things like this will never again. Who asked you? They need to see the seriousness of their mistake. Their mistake? The only mistake here is yours! You blamed them for a broken chair and hit them! You're sick! I demand that you resign. Fumiho will not be coming to school until you do! You know, Ms. Sawako... ...it isn't just your problem. What if people think this school allows corporal punishment? One act of one teacher can ruin our reputation. Understand? A written apology. And to think, he was famous for his punishments 20 years ago. Did you know that he once hit a student so hard his eardrums burst? Here. All idiots. Idiots give birth to idiots who give birth to more idiots. All we teachers can do is to let them run loose and flatter them. So, what next? Gas poisoning. It's still on? Our mission isn't over. The other arm. Across your chest. The other arm. Now turn. Now jump. Achilles tendons. Stretch it. Spread out your legs a little more. Feel it stretch? Now, the other foot. Stretch it well. You feel that? Yeah? Now, shake your hands and feet. Your feet, too. Shake your hands loose. Doesn't it feel good? Alright. Now, breathe deeply. Breathe in. Breathe out. That feels good. Again, breathe in. Breathe out. The last one now. Breathe in, in, in. Breathe in. And breathe out. You've got to breathe out or else... Shion, Mao, take her to the sick room. Maybe I should change our P.E. leader. I could let you take her place. But... why? Mr. Takimoto is really cool, huh? There is something I want you to tell me. What are you doing here? [Let's-Make-the-Teacher Have-a-Miscarriage-Club] Akina. Shion. Mizuki. Mao. Fumiho. Never underestimate adults. Quit your game, and I won't tell your parents. And you? Read it. Sulphur. Iron powder. Hydrochloric acid. Would you help us clean the pool? Help us! Help us! If you help, I'll treat everyone to good, cold ice pops! What do you say? We're going. Alright! Hurry now! How about you, Mizuki? We'll get soda-flavored ice pops! Come on! I give in! Hey! Quit that! Clean the pool! I said clean the pool! Get to it! Aw look, my shirt's all wet! She's in bed with a cold. You shouldn't lie. How come your mother didn't come the other day? I don't care what you do to Ms. Sawako. Leave Fumiho out of it. Here. Ms. Sawako! Ms. Sawako! Where are you? Ms. Sawako! Wait. She's coming. Ms. Sawako! Fumiho's gone. It's that miserable wretch! Mizuki Suzukawa lured her out! Ms. Sawako! [Iron Powder] [Sulphur] Fumiho! Why? Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! - Fumiho! - Fumiho. Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Help! Fumiho... Fumiho! I've got you now. Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Fumiho! Oh, thank goodness! Fumiho! Mizuki! Mizuki! Mizuki! You're making a mistake. You just want to feel secure. Why are you doing this? Because it's gross. Why is it gross? Dunno. Women are gross creatures. I'm gross, and you're gross. You know that. You're just trying to escape from the fact. Satisfied? Why!? Get out of my way! Move! Mom, stop it! Fumiho! Fumiho! Miss Taguchi! Is Miss Taguchi here? Come get your paper! Fumiho. Fumiho! Look what I bought today. Isn't it cute? It'll look good on you. Try it on and let me see. Well? I'll buy my own. A fetus is not considered an object of murder. So you won't be charged with murder. I'd say, abortion without consent... ...and the infliction of bodily injury. That's it. [Child Consultation Center] You dig. Why me? A family member can't. We can't pretend it never existed.
