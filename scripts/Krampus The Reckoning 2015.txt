I love it. What am I looking at here? That's Mommy, that's Daddy, that's me, and that's... Santa Claus, I know him when I see him. But where's your sister? Are you angry with her? Sweetheart? There was no more room on the paper. In the bleak mid-winter Long Angel, tell Grandma the truth. She makes Daddy angry, she makes Mommy sad. So sad that she cries. And you, does she make you sad? Sometimes. What are you reading? Oh this is an old story. Older than you? Yes, even older than me. What kind of story is it? It's a Christmas story. Can you read it to me? Oh I don't know, it's late. And this one used to give me nightmares. That looks like Santa. It is, or Saint Nicholas as he used to be called. So how's this a scary story? In the bleak mid-winter Long Who's that? Who's that? That's Krampus. You've never heard of Krampus? Well Krampus is old, very old. Old as time itself. And just as Santa rewards good little girls and boys, Krampus punishes the bad ones. That's not a true story. Don't be so sure child. As with many ancient stories, the Krampus has passed from legend into superstition. But old and forgotten things have a way of ever so slowly creeping back into our world. Snow had fallen, snow on snow Snow on snow In the bleak mid-winter Long Ago I got you! No. Yes Zoe, you're it! Zoe's it, I got her! What are you doing, Zoe? Gross! Don't touch it! Why? You're weird, stay away from me, Zoe. Yes Tristan, it was me. It was me all along. Strong for you, my one true love. Remember, with Christmas around the corner. It's extra important to listen to your parents. So you don't end up on the naughty list. Hey! Turn it back! What, you didn't hear me? My love for you is strong like a tiger. Then kiss me, Tigress. My love for you flows like a river. Like the mighty Amazon. Like the ancient Nile of Egypt. Laundry needs folding, Now, move it! Wow, what are you doing? I'm gonna have my way with you. That's rather fast. Right. What the hell? Bed, now. Ow, you're hurting me. Shut up. Hello? Who's there? Holy shit! Teddy? Dispatch, we have multiple DBs, requesting back-up, detectives and crime scene. Room clear. Room clear. Fremont, we got a locked door. Here you go, sweetheart. We've got a foster child, I'm not sure if she saw or heard anything, though. So far she's not talking. Let a couple of unis take her over to the children's warden. Mercy Immanuel Hospital. Stewart's on her way there now. Hope she can get something out of her. Okay. And... I need to call you back, bye. How can I help you? Dr. Rachel Stewart, I called from the road, I'm here for the Zoe Weaver interview. Right... Sign here. Dr. Stewart. Hey Miles. James, this is Dr. Stewart. She helps us out, from time to time. I try to anyway. My partner Detective Cegan. Doctor. Call me Rachel. Dr. Stewart, Det. O'Connor? Yes, that's us. Tom Jennings, Head of Pediatrics. If you'd like to follow me, please. So is she talking yet? It took us the better part of an hour to get her to tell us her name. Shock? Responsive, just disinterested. That's her. Sitting by herself over there. Let's go say hello. It's your case detective, but, I think we might have more luck if I go talk to her by myself first. Go ahead, it's your show, doc. Zoe, this is Dr. Stewart. Rachel. Dr. Stewart would like to ask you a few questions. Okay? What kind of doctor are you? I'm a child psychologist, so, I'm the kind of doctor that helps kids out when they've been through some scary stuff. What's that? What? That. Oh, I've had that for a really long time. Since I was probably about your age. So is it all right if I ask you a few questions? You want to know about Katie and Teddy. Yes. I'd like to know what happened to them. Why? They were bad, and now they're gone. How are they gone, Zoe? He took them. He took them because they were bad. He always comes for the bad ones. Who's he? Zoe, who hurt your foster parents? I don't wanna talk anymore. Now Zoe, you need to answer the doctor. No, it's okay. It's okay we can talk more later. Do you need anything? What? Anything I can get you, uhm, I don't know, toys or a book? My dolls and my sewing kit. I asked if I could bring them. But they said no. Sure. Are they at the house? In my room, under the bed. I'll find them for you. It was so nice meeting you, Zoe. I'll see you later. Well that was a short interview. You sure you don't wanna push a little harder? Not yet. Whatever she saw, she's clearly traumatized. We'll take it slow. She'll open up when she's ready. Let's hope so. I'm going to need access to the scene. Why? Zoe asked me to pick up a few things. You wanna take evidence from my crime scene? A little girl's dolls are probably not the smoking gun you're looking for. Ah, yeah. Cozy I guess. Well we found narcotics in the master bedroom. You think this could be drug related? I don't know. At this point anything and everything is possible. First responders found the girl in a room down the hall. Well it's cheerful enough. Yeah, seems to all be window dressing though. Turns out the Holezers were always taking in. One after the other. Neighbors said the kids always looked shabby. Dressed in Goodwill clothes. Always two sizes too big or too small. Miss Holezer though. She always dressed to the nines with a new car in the driveway. Could be a murder. Yeah, could be. Anyhow, angry broke parent or juvenile delinquent, giving the revolving door situation, I'm sure we're not gonna have a short list of suspects to sift through. Did you find what you're looking for? What is this? Yeah that's ugly. It's scary. Yeah, scary as well. All right uhm, ready to go? Impatient detective? Actually, bored stiff, doctor. All right. And that is why Santa has nine reindeer. Do you think Santa will remember to come here for us? How can he, there's no chimney in the hospital. Oh that's just not true. What? Remember yesterday when I took you out for a walk? Remember that huge smokestack by the tall building behind the garden? Yeah. Well, that's our chimney. And that is how Santa is gonna come, and bring you all a bunch of presents on Christmas Eve. That's not true. Zoe. What do you mean, Zoe? That's not a chimney. It's a smokestack. The smoke that comes out is from the bodies of the people that they burn after they die here. Zoe uh... You're a smart kid. I can tell. And I know you've been through a lot. But they've been through a lot too. You know, and they. You don't wanna scare 'em or give 'em nightmares, do you? Zoe? Are you okay? Why are you staring at that nice man? You brought my things? I did. Tell me about this little guy. He's the Krampus. That's his name, Krampus? He's kinda scary looking. Zoe are you ready to talk about what happened? What happened? When your parents d... They weren't my parents. They were bad. How were they bad? Zoe is there anything else you can tell me? Anything that you might've seen or heard? Tell me more about your scar. You don't like to talk about it, why? We're not here to talk about me. Hey sweetie. Yeah I'm almost done, I, yes I'll be home soon. I can totally pick up a pizza. I know, no mushrooms. Okay. Love you too, bye. Who was that? That was my son. Your son? His name is Lamar. Does his daddy live with you? His daddy actually passed away. His mommy did too, I'm his... You're his foster mother? Foster mothers are mean! Are you talking about Ms. Holezer? Were she and Mr. Holezer mean to you? And selfish. So Krampus said they needed to be punished. Krampus talks to you? Sometimes. What does he say? He knows who's been bad. And? He punishes them. How does he do that? He burns them. Burns them? Like Mr. and Ms. Holezer were burned? I'm tired. Zoe, it's really important that we... No! Zoe, I really... I said, no more. Okay. Okay you get some rest. I'll be back tomorrow. Lamar, dinner's here. Sweetheart? Hey! Christ you scared me! Oh God, I'll get the alarm. What happened in here? I got hungry so I tried to cook something up. And burn the house down in the process? Sorry. Sweetheart I told you I was bringing pizza home. Look at this. It's a disaster. I guess we'll have to eat our pizza with the fork. I guess so. Can you go open a window and grab us some plates? Hey Miles. Hey we got a positive ID on the vics. No surprise. Holezers are our BBRs. That was fast. Yeah, well, local media caught wind of this, so. I just wanted to make sure you had answers for the cameras in the morning. And? Did you get anything from the girl yet? You want me earning my paycheck? That bad? Yeah, even for a kid who's been through a lot there's something really weird about her. Is that your professional opinion Dr. Stewart? Ha-ha. Ah, she freaks you out, so, maybe we. Maybe I should slap the cuffs on her. See, press conference. Funny. Are you gonna stop by McCaffrey's for a pint? A pint? As in singular? Yeah, and a shot. Maybe two. Any chance you'd join me? Go home to your wife, Miles. There's a thought. I gotta go. Hey,. Well I'll be sure to stop by the church in the morning and. Ha, all right, good night Rachel. Bye. Can I help you? Hi I'm Tammy Miller from 308 and this is Jenny from 424. Hi. We're just letting folks know we're putting together a canned food drive this year to help some of the lower income families. Sorry, I can't help you. - What if you just... - Fuck off! And that is how Santa is gonna come and bring you all a bunch of presents for Christmas Eve. Birth name Zoe Weaver. Picture's over two years old and she hasn't aged a day. Krampus. Krampus, the Christmas devil. Originally found in Alpine folklore he's a horned anthropomorphic figure who punishes wicked children during the holiday season. Contrary to the different variations of Saint Nicholas, or Santa Claus who is said to reward good children, Krampus is sent to punish the evil ones. What the fuck? Ah, fuck! Mom! What sweetheart? There's a drunk cop at the door. What? Really? What? What are you doing here? I was just, I was in the neighborhood and then I... I thought I'd stop by and see what my favorite psychiatrist was up to. Sleeping, at least I was. What are you talking about? It's like 10... Oh, 11:30. Go home Miles. That's a good idea. Oh, Christ Miles, look at you. Come in, I'll call you a cab, you're not driving like this. Watch your step. You have a nice place here. Where's my phone? Elizabeth kicked me out. What? When? Last week. Ah, I don't know, maybe the week before. She's divorcing me. For real this time. Had her lawyer serve me the papers and everything. I'm so sorry, Miles. Where are you staying? Some shitbag motel. Over on Forest. I swear, it feels like I've arrested half the people that hang around that place. You can crash on the couch tonight. Thanks. You are the best. Lamar? Just a second, we're attacking the warlocks in full force. This is what you do right before you have to go to bed? Ah shit! Hey, language. Sorry, it's just that we were so close that time. You can slaughter warlocks later, it's bedtime. Hey, I mean it. I know, I'll just be a few more minutes. All right, good night. Just three months ago. What happened to you, Delores? And the good witch turned Greta back into a princess. I'm tired of this story. I know. Wait, Grandma doesn't like us touching her things. She'll never know unless you tell. Lamar? He better not use all the hot water again. Rachel? Morning. Wondering where you are? This would be my living room. Oh shit... Coffee? Ugh, yeah. Oh shit. You like it black, right? Yeah. Hmm. You have the good stuff. No need to ask how you're feeling. Would it be too much trouble to ask you for some aspirin? Not at all, I got some upstairs. Did you finish your homework for Ms. Maura? All of it? Uhuh. All right, see you downstairs. Oh fuck. Hey. Oh, hey. Sorry. Hang on. O'Connor. No, yeah, yeah, yeah, soon. Yeah, yeah, yeah, kiss my ass, James. Late for work? Nah, seems I got another case. It's crazy, it's like, back in Chicago again. Could this be a murder? Yeah. Possibly. Here's nice to a uh, nice and simple suicide. So, you and my Mom? We work together, sweetheart. Oh thanks. Is that all you're having for breakfast honey? I could make you toast and eggs. No time. A kiss at least? Bye Mom. Have a good day at school. I will. He's a nice kid. He's way too cool for Mom, but, yeah, he's a pretty special guy. Yeah, I remember the Coldman case. It was brutal. He was your first, right? Third. His parents had been dead almost a week when we found him. Seemed to have bounced back pretty good though. Seems that way. A lot of times though with childhood trauma, they bury it so deep inside it's like it never happened. And then one day, all of the sudden, it just all comes rushing back at once. Yeah. I just saw this perfect child in the middle of all the horror and destruction. It really tugged at my heartstrings though, so, I called in a few favors, fast tracked the adoption. That's uh... Really good of you to do that. Everybody said I was crazy, but, I just couldn't see letting him go into foster care. I mean look at poor Zoe. Yeah. There's probably no hot water left, but, if you'd like to take a shower? Oh yeah, no. There's not enough time. James has been calling all morning, it seems we caught the fresh one, so. Okay. Hey uh, last night, we didn't? I mean, I didn't like do anything to? Make a total ass of yourself? Hell I know I did that, but... You're fine Miles. Nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to brag about. All right, good. So uh, I guess it's see you later then. Later. We're sorry, the number you have dialed is not in service at this time. Child Protective Services, this is Sandra. Hi Sandra, this is Dr. Stewart calling for Angie Durant. Hold please. This is Angie. Hey Angie, this is Dr. Stewart, I'm working with Maricopa County Homicide right now on a case involving a minor. One Zoe Weaver, date of birth, 9-6-04. Case number? Uhm, AZ640213. Okay, just one second here. Hmm, nothing's coming up. What was that number again? AZ640213. Let me try again. Nope, no case files matching that number. Really? I have it pulled up right in front of me. It's Zoe Weaver, current legal guardians Catherine and Theodor Holezer. Former guardians, Delores and Henry Kelly. Uh the number I have for them is no good. But the address is 860 North Range Road, looks like it's in a town called Riley. I've just ran a name search as well, and the only Zoe Weaver that comes back is from a case in 1992. This is crazy, I'm gonna send you the link right now. Hang on. Ugh, now the page isn't loading. It could be a server issue, but everything seems to be working fine on my end. Okay, well thanks for your time. Sorry I couldn't be of anymore help. Not a problem. Have a great day, doctor. You too, bye. Well, so much for the simple suicide, huh? What do we got? Same MO as the last one. Small contained burn. No obvious point of origin, no explainable accelerance. Consistent in the fact that I can't give you a single useful answer. James, do you have any idea? Yeah. Get a load of this. Joseph Mooney, RN. Mercy Immanuel. Pediatrics unit. That's Zoe Weaver's unit. Hmm-mm. Hey Rachel, it's Miles, come as soon as you get this, all right? We've gotta get something from the Weaver kid. Any way we can. Hello? Oh my God, please! Who are you? I'm Dr. Rachel Stewart, I'm with Maricopa County Homicide. You a cop? I'm a doctor, I work with the police. What do you want? I'm looking for Delores or Henry Kelly? What for? I need to ask them about their former foster child, Zoe Weaver. Mama? This lady here is from the police. She wants to talk to you about Zoe. Ms. Kelly. My name is Rachel Stewart, I'm with Maricopa County Homicide. Ms. Kelly I'd like to discuss your former ward, Zoe Weaver. He was a good man. Not perfect. But Lord knows he didn't deserve to die... Don't worry. What? I didn't say anything. There's nothing wrong with my coffee. No, of course not. It's very good, thank you. So it's just the two of you here? Why do you wanna know about Zoe? She might have been a witness to something, but, I'm having a hard time getting through to her. I thought maybe... I'm not surprised she grew up to be hell on wheels, shit, she sure was that way 20 years ago, when she came to stay with us. There must be some mix up, I'm talking about Zoe Weaver. The blond-haired devil child. But we must be talking about different people. The girl that I'm talking about... Here it is. This is impossible. I don't even know why I kept it. I only have so few pictures of my Momma happy. When was this taken? Before Daddy died, so uh, what, it had to be '91 or '92. That was more than 20 years ago. Last time this was a happy home. The girl in the picture? Yeah, Zoe. No... No, it can't be. Must've been taken a month, maybe two, before they found my daddy. Rough way to go. I only hope he was dead before the fire got him. He was burned? To a cinder. Mama swears it was Zoe. Crazy as that sounds, that child had the devil in her. Can I get a picture of this? Sure. Did Zoe have any toys, like strange little dolls? You mean the Krampus? She never parted with that ugly little thing. And threw a fit, something awful, if Momma ever tried to take it from her. So no, it don't surprise me she'd still have it. Merry Christmas now. And watch your back with Zoe. Why are you staring at me? I don't stare at you even though your face is ugly. I'm sorry. What happened? What? How did your face get so messed up? It was a fire. You started it? No. How then? Tell me! Why? Because if you tell me I might be able to help you. What do you mean? Fire. It's not your friend, but it's mine. It was your parents? My dad. He burned you? He made you ugly forever! He didn't mean to. I just fell asleep. And now you're ugly. How does that make you feel? I... I... Go on, tell me. I don't want to. Go away then! Zoe? Ashley said that you made her cry. That you called her ugly. Is that true? She is ugly. Zoe! We don't talk to people like that. We don't say things that hurt people's feelings and make them cry. You've been crying too. Crying for Joe. You shouldn't cry for him. He was a bad man. I'll give this back to you, when you learn to speak to people nicely. Hey, where have you been, I've been calling all day! Miles, we need to talk. What I have to tell you seems impossible, but... We found another body. What? Just like the Holezers case. Nothing but ashes left. Oh my God, who? Joseph Mooney. A nurse, at Mercy Immanuel. Children's ward. Rachel? I'm here. What are the odds, huh? There's more. What do you mean? I just paid a visit to Delores Kelly, Zoe Weaver's former foster mother. Yeah, and? This is gonna sound crazy. Hey, it's been two solid days of crazy. Okay, our top priority is getting something from Zoe. Rachel, are you hearing me? , with this kid? You need to get something from her today. And I don't care what you gotta do, if you gotta use a crowbar,. Okay. Mercy Immanuel then. I'll meet you there. Sir, you can't smoke that here. What? This is a hospital sir, there's no smoking on the property or the parking lot. All right, sorry. I thought you quit. Hey James. I uhm, just spoke to the datatechs that State Police sent over. Yeah, those fuckers. Ah, they're all right. I mean we're all supposed to be on the same team or something, right? Yeah, something. Anyway, get this. I had 'em search his computer for any recent web activity. Turns on Mooney, had the largest collection of kiddie porn these guys had ever come across. Sick bastard. Yeah. They say there's a whole underground network of these freaks that trade the stuff like baseball cards. All right, so how does this connect to Zoe and the Holezers case? I don't know if it does. Either way, the captain is gonna be pissed, and now with this whole child porn in the mix, there's no way he's keeping the Feds away. Here she is. Gentlemen. Child porn? Terabytes of the stuff. God... I just can't believe it. How well did you know Mr. Mooney? I mean not well, not socially anyway. But I liked him. I mean we all did. I just can't believe he could be involved in something like that. You're up. Zoe, we need to talk. What are you drawing? This is not gonna work. Do you have any yarn? No, I'm sorry, I don't. It has to be a dolly or it's not gonna work. Who's the man in the drawing? He's stupid! Bring me some yarn and I'll tell you what you wanna know. You know what I wanna ask you? Yes. Okay, how about this? If you agree to answer a few of my questions, I promise I'll bring you some yarn. Okay. I saw Ms. Kelly today, do you remember her? Delores? Yes, I remember her. She was nice, but Henry wasn't. Mr. Kelly? Your foster father? Was, now he's gone. Like Mr. and Ms. Holezer. And Joe. He was bad, now he's gone too. Zoe, you know it's impossible that you could've known Mr. Kelly, he disappeared years before you were born. I don't wanna talk to you anymore. Well, I'm afraid it's not that simple. The police are looking for the person who's been hurting people, and they think you might be able to help them. It's Christmas time. Do you know what happens at Christmas time? Santa Claus comes. Santa Claus isn't real. Okay, what happens? Nothing, if you're good. And what if you're bad? Zoe, what happens to the bad people? Is it Krampus, is he the one that hurts them? Isn't that what you told me yesterday? Yarn first, no more questions! No, Zoe, you have to help... Put me down, let me go! Nurse, please take her to her room. Put me down! Put me down! Stop it, let me go! Put me down! Let me go! Zoe that's quite enough. Now. Are you going to be okay if I let Mr. Travis let you go? I don't know what's got into you. We cannot have anymore outbursts like that, Zoe. You hurt Dr. Stewart. She yelled at me. That's because she has questions for you. Questions concerning what may have happened to your foster parents. But I've already told her. It was Krampus. Krampus. And Krampus always hurts the people you don't like? No, he only hurts bad people. People like Joe, and Katie, and Teddy. Mr. Travis, thank you. If you can wait outside for us. Zoe have a seat. You know lots of children have imaginary friends. And that's okay. But Krampus is more than imaginary to you, isn't he? But it's okay. You don't need to be afraid. Krampus knows you're not one of the bad people. Look, why don't you get some rest? You're probably just overtired. That's just... Crazy, I know. But according to Andrew Kelly, this picture was taken over 20 years ago. You see that? Looks like Zoe. Thanks, Brian. Hey uh, it could be a fake. Maybe this guy is crazy or maybe he's having some fun with you. I don't think so. All right, so what? You're saying our little Zoe is actually a woman in her 30s. With an imaginary friend who kills people by burning them alive? That's a little far-fetched even for me. I know. Another beer? Uh, Patron Silver please. It's not just that. Then what? I can't shake this feeling that I've met her before. Wow. What? That's more like it. Yeah, you're breaking out the big guns here, Doc. Oh, you're one to talk. Oh hey, I'm not criticizing, so. But if you wanna drink with me it's gonna have to be Jameson. Brian, two Jameson. You scared me. What do you want? I'm sorry I made you cry. I made this for you. What is it? You'll see. Let's get one more, Brian. I think that you ought to slow down. Really? Detective O'Connor, did I just hear you tell me to slow down? If I recall correctly, it was you passed out on my couch last night. Fair enough. Ho, where are you going? Ladies room. All right. Man, you got a tight little package there. Excuse me? I don't like those professional types, they know how to play it to keep us guessing, am I right? Yeah, sure. Now, don't, don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. No doubt she's got a tight little body under all of that. And she's just not showing you. It keeps the mystery alive. We're coworkers. Yeah, you just let me know, if you need a hand, coworking her over. What's your name, friend? Clay. Last name. What, are you writing a book? Simple question, is all. Fuck off, that's my name. Elsworth. Yeah... Clayton Elsworth. The drunk bum who fell asleep with a lit cigarette, and burned his house down. Your daughter was lucky to barely escape with her life. You got a mouth on you, mister. Fellas, please. You're that cop asshole. Yeah, that would be me. Miles, what's going on? Nothing to worry your head about, little missy. It's just your boyfriend is the kind of fella who's mouth will get him into trouble. Ah time to go. You have yourself a nice evening, Mr. Elsworth. Just don't go burning anymore little girls now. Another double. We need music. Hey Rachel I really think I should probably go. Ssshht! Oh, I love this one. Dance with me, Miles. Come on, Miles, dance with me. Dancing is not really my thing. Whoo! It's just dancing. So this is dancing? You are a very good dancer. All right... Hmm-mm. Oh, I need a goddamn lighter. Ah. Ah, merry fucking Christmas. What the fuck? Oh God. Ah, ah shit, ah! You feel better? Yeah. Just tired. Yeah that's the thing about Mr. Jameson. If you're not careful, he'll sneak up on you. You never told me how you got this. It's nothing I can remember. Not clearly anyway. I've had it since I was really young. Hmm... It's always bothered me though. What, that you don't remember how you got the scar? I don't remember anything about my childhood before the Stewarts took me in. What like repressed memories or something? Maybe, I mean, we're not supposed to self-diagnose, but... It's all a blur. I get flashes. Dreams sometimes. Bob and Dina were no help. Was that your foster parents? Hmm-mm. Yeah, I asked Mom about it a few times before she died. She always changed the subject very quickly. Dad was even worse. Worse, how? Well he'd never say anything about it, but, the look he would get if I brought it up, he was terrified. Anyway. I know my birth parents died in a fire. I have this scar. Nothing else. No reports, no records. Nothing I've been able to find anyway. Well that's... Weird though, I would think with your access, you would've found something. Nothing. Which is next to impossible unless someone destroyed the records. Yeah but, who's gonna do that? It's like everything from before. Who I was, who my parents were. They're just gone. Hi Mom. I thought you were staying at Jason's? His WiFi is down. Ah... Well... Yeah. Guess I should go. You can stay here if you'd like, there's the couch or... I should probably get back to the motel. If I'm not back soon, the junkies around there will probably, or something. Understood. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Another time. Okay. It's time, Rachel. And for those who have been wicked with the year's end approaching, saw to it that the Krampus prepared to cast them into the fire. What does that mean? What do you think? Krampus killed them. That can't be true. Wait, there's more here. What? Listen to this. But Saint Nicholas grew angry with the Krampus, and to punish him had the chains of civility forged. The chains made the Krampus the servant of the Saint and he could no longer punish at will, but would now only punish those of Nicholas' his choosing. Then what happened? There's a picture here, but the letters make no sense. Chains that bind you, now bind you to me. Rachel. No! Lamar? There's someone in here! It's okay sweetie, it's just... Who was that? Zoe! Who is Zoe? Mom look out! We've gotta get to the police. Police? Police, Miles, just, Lamar I really need to concentrate, I need you to be quiet. You can't go this way! And he punishes all the wicked little boys and girls with the fire, and the fire is what cleanses the world of evil. What are you doing? Go back to bed. Rachel make it stop, please, stop! How is she doing? Stable, it's the kid we're worried about. Lamar? Lamar? Lamar? No... No... Hello Rachel. Zoe! He's gonna die, Rachel. And it's all your fault. What? Damn, he's crashing. Nurse, defibrillator. Three, two, one... Clear! Damn, damn, again. Charging. The Krampus came for you. He came for you because you were bad. What are you talking about? You killed us. Mommy, Daddy and me. I didn't. You don't remember? Just a bad dream you thought? Just a nightmare like all the others? All right, three, two, one. Clear! Damn it! We've got to stabilize him. One, two, three, four, five, six... Stay with me, Lamar. Don't you remember the fire? What are you doing? Don't you remember what you did? And the fire is what cleanses the world of evil. No please, stop! Remember? It was just... You can't remember the Krampus or the story from Grandmother's book? Chains that bind you, now bind you to me. Or how you would make Mommy cry?
