You're totally missing it! It's fucking crazy here, man! Dude! Kev. I've got an idea. I want you to drop what you are doing. I want you to come down here and take a picture of this for the paper! (LAUGHING) Now that, my friend, is front page material. Lateski. Hey, Mom! Gina, Morris and I are gonna leave for Fieldmont right after school today. Honey, I completely forgot about that. Can you do it next weekend? Derek was gonna take me into the city tomorrow night for dinner. - God! It's already 7:00? - KEVIN: We can't. Morris has a scholarship meeting and we're signed up for the campus tour. - Carter. - Hi. What's up Ms. B? Dude, she totally threw off my groove! I was almost at the top level. - Hey, Carter. - What's up, man? What's up, little people? Running a little bit low. Kev! Can I ask you a question? You know that book that Miss Dangle makes everybody read about the mice? - You mean Of Mice and Men? - Bingo! That's the one, yeah. So let me get this straight. These two dudes dream of buying a farm together to raise rabbits? Hmm. And I'm no expert, but doesn't that seem a little... I don't know. Kind of G-A-Y? Dude, I think you're kind of missing the point. - We can spell, Carter. - Yeah, dumb A-S-S. Dude. Satan's children, I swear. Spawn of Satan. (CAR HORN HONKING) Right. Come on, guys! Mrs. Seavers is here. Let's go! Grab your backpacks. Oh, yeah! All right, see you guys! (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) Would you look at this guy? Why do we have to hang out with him? - Hey, Morris. - Hey, guys. Hey, Morris, what's up with all the geek books? I've got a scholarship interview in a day, Carter. And my parents are up my ass about it. Morris, your parents are always up your ass. Besides, don't you want to go to some fancy-shmancy Ivy League school? Guys, come on! Do we really have to start this early? Well, apparently, it's not my choice, Carter. At least Kevin will be there. Right, Kev? Yep. Hey, did you grab your stuff so we can split right after school today? Yeah. It's in my... Yeah, the technique was a little off, but the timing was better. And by the way, she's easy, but not in the, like, I'm-gonna-fuck-Morris kind of way easy. Come on, Kev, I've got to pee. I need you to shake it. Carter. You sure you don't wanna come with us this weekend, man? What? There's no reason for him to come. You know what, Morris? I think, for the first time, you and I are on the same page. I don't know. Campus tours and scholarship interviews, sounds like a real blastie-blast. But I think I'd rather sock myself in the nuts. I mean, seriously, look at this thing. Like, where are all the hotties, you know? Show some skin. - Hey. - Hey! - Hey, Gina. - Hey, Gina. Kevin, really, just... Listen, don't take this the wrong way. But I need to talk to your friend outside, alone. (LAUGHS) Nice! Does that mean you're gonna blow him underneath the bleachers? Yeah. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Awesome! You kids have fun! High five! I got my high five, dude. Does he give you a high five like that? See you... Here's your brochure, though. Have a good weekend. Miami? - When did you apply there? - A couple months ago. KEVIN: What about us? I mean, what about our plans to go to Fieldmont together? And the campus tour this weekend? Just go without me. Look, it's senior year. It's, like, so exciting, and I wanna party, and I wanna have fun. And you're, like, not fun. Like, so what? So I don't drink very much, you know. We still have fun. Like our Friday nights at mini golf. Yeah, they're kind of boring. Our camping trips, the school carnival, studying together? Standing around while you're taking pictures of everything? - Thrilling! - Gina... When we were freshmen, it was one thing. But this is our time to really go crazy! We're supposed to be partying. And you, you're just... You're a loser! Kevin, it's over. College is just around the corner, and I can't let you ruin my senior year. That's mine. CARTER: Okay, so let me get this straight. You didn't get blown under the bleachers? No! Dude, have you been listening to me? She dumped me! I was dumped once. Morris, you're such a fucking liar, dude. - You've never even had a girlfriend. - Shut up, Carter. Yes, I did. Remember, Kev? You introduced me to her. - Right. - MORRIS: She was real. - We went to physics camp together. - Maybe more like fantasy camp. Come on, you guys. Do you mind? I'm having a breakdown here. What am I supposed to do now? It was all set. First, we'd go to college together, and then we'd get married, have a couple kids, one girl, one boy. Dude, is that the kind of shit you would say to Gina? God! No wonder she dumped your ass. You're fucking lame. - What's up, fellows? - What's up, Fletcher? What's up with Negative Nancy over here? Gina dumped him. He's having a breakdown. Cool. So are you guys going on some sort of road trip to Fieldmont this weekend? - I don't think I'm going anymore. - That's too bad. I just went there last weekend to visit my bro. I almost didn't make it back. "Almost didn't make it back"? Dude, it's just college. Yeah, yeah, just college. Yeah, see, that's what I thought, too. And then I went, and I'm telling you guys right now, it is fucking nuts, man. It's retarded. Why? What happened? You guys want to know? Basically, this is how it went down. I didn't sleep for three days, okay? I don't have any money left in my bank account. I maxed out my parents' credit card, which was only supposed to be used in case of an emergency. I lost my cell phone, which is actually my dad's cell phone. So he's pissed about that and the credit card. I tried smoking a tampon, which I thought was a big fat joint. Still got high. Stole a car, got in a bar fight, ate some goldfish. Played naked Frisbee, did some whip-its, wet my brother's bed twice. Shit my pants, once, but please don't tell anyone, 'cause I'm kind of embarrassed about that. Saw two girls make out. With tongue! With tongue! Watched my brother's roommates eat as many cheeseburgers as they could until one of them puked. Found a tattoo on my lower back of a unicorn. Don't remember getting that. Figure I'll just tell people it's some sort of killer unicorn. You know? So it doesn't seem so gay. I laughed. I cried. Fell in love. Yeah, and did I mention earlier that I got laid? Three times. Different girls, yeah. So all in all, I'd say it was pretty much the best weekend of my fucking life. Yeah. Dude, you should go. What if I could have a weekend like that, a weekend like Fletcher's? How? No way. Who knows if he's even telling the truth? Come on, man. What if he was? You heard him. All the craziness, the partying, the sex, the drinking, it sounds incredible. You know, maybe I'll even get a tattoo. Wait, you're joking, right? You got me, Kev. That's a good one. Partying, drinking, sex. Up top. I'm not kidding, Morris. You know, maybe Gina's right, I'm no fun. A weekend like Fletcher's is exactly what I need. Kev, having some crazy weekend to get back at Gina is a really bad idea. Or a really good idea, and I say go for it. Bitch. You know what? I'm gonna go for it. In fact, I'm gonna have a better weekend than Fletcher. Yes! (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) (BLOWING RASPBERRY) Dude, I am so going. MAN: (SINGING) I gotta move While the streets ahead are sunny Fall in love with some honey Oh, mama I gotta move It's time I broke out into the open You know I'll settle down again some day Dude, this is definitely better than the brochure! KEVIN: Yeah, man, I've got a good feeling about this. Good feeling? What kind of good feeling? Like your-boy-Carter's-gonna-get-laid kind of feeling? 'Cause I have that feeling too, and I love it! I don't know, man, just everything. I'm ready to have fun. Yeah, man, good! Positive vibes. Positive vibes. Okay, Kev, it says here that the campus tour is at 12:30 tomorrow afternoon. And there's a pre-frosh reception tonight before dinner in the main... Okay, that's enough! That is enough. No more. That's our schedule for the weekend! Dude, Morris, fuck schedules, man! We're in college now. You know what that means? No parents! No curfew! Free fucking beer! It does not get any better than this! Except for that. Dude, slow down, slow down. Hey, what's up, ladies? You on your way to class? No. We just like carrying all these books around for fun. (LAUGHING) Right! A girl's got to read, huh? Awesome. So, look, we're in town for the weekend, and we were just kind of wondering if you guys could, I mean, I don't know, show us around? New guys, huh? What college are you visiting from? No, no, see, we're not in college. - We're actually still in high school. - CARTER: What the fuck? - I hate you so much! - Stop it! You're crushing my testicles! - What my friend meant to say was... - Fuck off! All righty then. I'll see you guys later. Hey, green shirt, if I give you $5 right now, would you fart in a can and let me just keep it in my bedroom? I'll never open it! I promise. These dorms are whack. Why do we have to stay here? You don't have to, Carter. This is where the admissions board put me and Kevin. Look, I got a cousin who's a legacy in one of the fraternities. I'm sure if we go there, they'll hook us up. - Yeah, my parents would love that. - Yeah. Enough, you guys! Look, I don't see what's so bad about this, Carter. (MAN MOANING) (WHIPPING ON TV) - What? - ALL: God! (WOMAN MOANING ON TV) - Hi. - Hey, there. I'm Morris. I'm Kevin, Kevin Brewer, prospective freshman. We're supposed to be staying in your room this weekend. Right. Look, fellows, I'm gonna need about So just come back later. Probably just working out. Yeah, he's just working out one of these. - Disgusting! - How's that frat house sound, guys? Pretty good? Awesome. KEVIN: Okay, dude, do you actually know where you're going? Dude, relax! It's right up here, I think. All right, dude, I'm not perfect, all right? All these Greek letters look the same to me. Maybe we should go back and try the dorm again. You shut your mouth! Shut your mouth! Or not. That's cool, too. Holy shit. Those chicks definitely weren't in the brochure. - Hey, guys. - Hey. - What's up, college girls? - Ladies. - I'm Morris. - Hi, Morris. - She said my name. - Chicks are smoking hot! Yeah. "Chicks are smoking hot"? Come on, real smooth, Carter. Yeah. Smooth. Whatever! All you got out was your name. Which she repeated back to me, I'd like to note. Shut up. (PELLET GUN FIRES) Jesus! - Nut shot. - Ten points! Get some. Shitty news, dudes. Dean Chandler has denied our petition, and we're still on probation. Shit! I guess he's taking that whole singing thing pretty seriously. Looking good, Goose. Looks like we got another semester without any pledges. This fucking blows, man! What's the point of college if you can't have pledges? Shit! (PELLET GUN FIRING) Fuck! MAN: Fuck! Son of a... That's it. This just might be the year to graduate. - What? - What? - No. - Yeah, I didn't think it'd come so soon. You can't graduate. You're Bearcat. - You're an institution. - I know. I'm scared to graduate. It seems like torturing pledges, that's all I'm good at. That's not true, and you know that. You're good at a lot of things. Cooper, tell him what he's good at. Like... Like the keg toss. And you take the biggest dumps in the house. Right? Yeah. Nobody beats you at that. It's like a real gift. It is, isn't it? Thanks, guys. I feel a lot better. - Hang in there, big guy. - You're all right. Hang in there. We'll figure this whole pledge thing out, I promise. Hey, man, is this the Beta Phi house? What? You can't read Greek? My cousin is a legacy here. - Yeah? Who's your cousin? - Toby Scott. You mean Queef? - What? - Queef. - What's a queef? - A pussy fart. It's his pledge name. - Who'd want that name? - Yeah, he earned it. I'd like to help you guys out, with you being his cousin and everything, but... Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Come on, man. Look, we're in high school, you know? We're just up here to party, you know? Is that too much to ask? You guys are a bunch of high school kids? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, okay? Go try the dorms. - A legacy, dude? - Yeah, he's... I... I can't believe they call Toby "Queef." Toby kicks ass. What did those guys want? A couple of high school kids looking to crash here for the weekend. One of them was Queef's cousin. Remember him? God, that guy could toss a salad. That thing he did with his tongue? Sorry. That guy's a loser. So, they're looking for a place to crash, huh? - Maybe we should let them stay. - COOPER: What, are you serious? What the hell are we gonna do with a bunch of fucking high school kids here all weekend? TEAGUE: Brothers. MAN: Do it, man! - Listen up. - Boner. Goose, shut the fuck up. (MEN LAUGHING) These guys. What's your names? I'm Kevin, and this is Morris and Carter. Okay, whatever. These guys are our guests for the weekend. (ALL CHEERING) Well, see, technically, we're supposed to stay in the dorms, but our roommate's a little... - MAN: Technically, you're a fag! ...preoccupied. Yeah, he's jerking off. Pussy! Fuck hole! Did we say you could talk? Bearcat! Relax, big man. They didn't mean anything by it. Sorry. He's got anger management issues. How about I show you guys where you are staying? Put your stuff away? - Morris, do you like the sound of that? - MAN: Party! - ALL: Party! Party! Party! - Party! Party! Party! - Party! Party! Party! - Party! Party! Party! - Party! Party! Party! - Party! Party! Party! - Party! Party! Party! - Party! Party! Party! What's up, shit face? This is usually where we let our pledges stay. We call this room the dungeon, but don't let the name scare you. You're gonna love it. (CRASHING) COOPER: Watch the step. Yeah, this place fucking sucks. Dude, it beats some guy jerking, all right? Like we said, all of our guest rooms are taken tonight. Yeah. We feel really bad about having to put you guys down here. - Is that a rat? - A rat? No. Probably just a shadow. And don't you guys worry. We're gonna give you the 411 on all the great parties this weekend. In fact, I think that the Lambdas are having a kegger tonight. Keggers? We love keggers. Right, Kev? Keggers, keggers! We are all about keggers. Cool. Well, you guys are gonna love the Lambdas. COOPER: Bearcat! - What the fuck is up with that... - BEARCAT: Are you talking? - No, man. I'm chilling. What? - Yeah. Shut the fuck up. So excited! All right, guys. This is it. Party time. Let's do the rundown. Rubbers? Check. Breath mints? Check. Retainers? (GROANS) I was kidding. That's so fucking gross. Put that away. - So, you guys sure about this? - Relax, man. It's just a frat party. What? What? We're here to learn about college, right? God, I love the new attitude, Kevin. It looks good on you, man. It makes your eyes pop and your hair shine. It makes your shirt look better. Good times. Good times. All right, guys. Hold onto your socks, because this is going to be awesome. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, guys! Come on in! The kegs are full and the Jacuzzi's hot! Yeah! Party! Yeah! What's up? Going on? Ladies? There's a lot of dudes here, right? Yeah. It's a total sausage fest. Check it out! These guys are so drunk they're making out with each other. Morris, I don't think they're drunk. Who wants to play glow-in-the-dark boners now? (CROWD CHEERING) It's boner tag! It's boner tag! (EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST) Why would they send us to an all-gay fraternity? Do we look gay? Maybe they found out how many times you've been laid and just assumed. Real funny, Carter. Look, my cousin's a legacy. I doubt they're gonna do that to us on purpose. Don't worry! That was not full of my piss or anything. Just Bearcat's. MAN: Yeah! Hey, how was the party? Did you guys find any dates? Yeah, real funny, guys. We almost got jumped back there. Watch your step, pre-frosh! This ain't high school! Welcome to college, boys. Enjoy. Crap. MAN: (SINGING) Don't talk about it Oh, boy, don't talk about it If you do, I'll die Holy shit! This is insane! No, man. This is fucking college. (IMPLANTS SQUISHING) God bless America for such a place! Let's rock this bitch. (GLASS SHATTERING) Hey! Hey! Hey! What's up, fellows? Look, we feel like absolute shit for what happened earlier. - Yeah. We think you guys are cool. - Yeah. It was just a joke. We weren't trying to be like assholes or anything. Let us make it up to you. We're gonna go do some body shots. And we would love it if you guys would come with us. Dude, we are so down! Actually, you know what? I just filled up, so I'm cool. Yeah, I think I'm gonna take a pass, too. (SCOFFS) Lame and lamer. Just saying, man, I guess Gina was right. Dude, where's the bathroom? All right. All right, you know what? Fuck it! I'm in. - COOPER: Bottle. - This is awesome. Salt. Limes. And lube. - What the hell is that for? - TEAGUE: Just in case. We probably won't need it. You guys... You guys are gonna love this. Where did the girls go? Unfortunately, (GRUNTS) the girls had to go home early. So who are we doing body shots off of? - Great question, Mike. - Morris. Bearcat was nice enough to take their place. Bearcat? MAN: Yeah! (GROANS) (ROARING) (ALL CHEERING) That's right, motherfuckers! - Okay, we're outta here, let's go. - Yeah. Where are you guys going? Yeah, we thought you guys were cool. We thought you wanted to party. Guess we were wrong. Well, have fun back at the dorm, you fucking pussies. (FRAT BOYS CHANTING) (ALL CHEERING) (FRAT BOYS CHANTING) - ALL: Do it! Do it! Do it! - Do it! Do it! Do it! - Do it! Do it! Do it! - Do it! Do it! Do it! - Do it! Do it! Do it! - Do it! Do it! Do it! - MAN: Do that shot! - Yeah! MAN: Do that shot! Do it! Watch this!

There you go, darling, that one's just for you. - I'm gonna sit. - All right. Hey, here you go. Have a balloon. This balloon's for you! Have a balloon! No, no. You have to inhale it. It makes chicks crazy horny, like her. MORRIS: Wow. (INHALING DEEPLY) Feel the flow. Hey, I saw a laundry room back there. You want to go make out or something? - Oh, my God! Are you serious? - Yeah. I haven't heard a line like that since, like, high school. Later. You've got flat tits! Do you mind? What? Yeah, absolutely. Have a... Have a sip. Or down the whole thing. That's cool. Whatever. (BURPING) I'm so getting laid. Excuse me. Excuse me! Excuse me. Excuse me! What's up? How's it going? Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! You're bigger than me. Excuse me! Excuse me! This is awesome! Wait. What was that? (GIRLS LAUGHING) Shit! I think someone's coming. - No, no, no. The bed, the bed! - What? - I'm not gonna fit under there! - You'll fit! - I will not fit under this bed. - Get under! (DOOR OPENING) Are you sure this room's okay? It's fine. Relax, okay? Everyone's downstairs. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Positive. GIRL 1: I'm just a little nervous, you know? I've never really been with a girl before. GIRL 2: Don't worry. I'll be gentle. I promise. (INAUDIBLE) Morris, maybe it's because I'm really high right now, but I will just go for this. Go for what? You want another... Sorry. Your hand is down my pants. I know. Just relax. Sweet! Oh, God! That feels so good! - Your hands are like butter! - Are like butter. You know, normally, I'd be doing this to myself, but this is way better. Plus, I don't have to worry about my mom walking in, and... Heather? Hello? (SNORING) Damn it! So close! (SIRENS BLARING) Cop! - What's your problem? - Hey, come on. - Run! - Who is that? Party's busted! Everybody run! GIRL: That sucks. (GIRL MOANING) GIRL 1: That feels so good. GIRL 2: I almost forgot. GIRL 1: You carry that with you? GIRL 2: They don't call it a pocket rocket for nothing. (INAUDIBLE) (VIBRATOR BUZZING) GIRL 1: You got it? GIRL 2: Yeah. I got it. Where were we? (GIRL 1 MOANING) GIRL 2: I didn't know you were so kinky. GIRL 1: Yeah! Kiss me. Kiss me now. - GIRL 2: Really? - Kiss me! Do it! - What was that? - GIRL 2: I didn't hear anything. - GIRL 1: Are you sure? - Yeah. Just relax. What the fuck do you know about welfare reform? MAN: Come on down and check it out. (CELL PHONE BEEPS) So, I don't really know what this means, but Amy says that she's under the bed with your friend Carter. (BOTH LAUGHING) - Should I be worried? - Yeah, definitely. Okay. Wait a second. Why aren't they on top of the bed? That's a good question. So what are you guys? Freshmen? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're freshmen. Yep. What's your major? Uh... - Photography. - Really? I love photography. I really suck, but that's cool. I heard they have a really great program here. Yeah. It's supposed to be one of the best in the country. Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime. Yeah, sure. (DOOR CLOSING) That was so hot. Please tell me you're as horny as I am right now. - Hornier. - Good. BEARCAT: What's up, man? Wow, motherfucker, I can't believe we did that shit last night. What the... Christmas came early! (VIBRATOR BUZZING) (BEARCAT MOANING) - Here we are. - Yep. Here we are. You know, you're different than most college guys. Well, you know, I don't even really feel like a college guy. Yeah. I could tell. But it's a good thing. - Maybe I'll see you around. - Yeah. - I hope so. - Okay. Bye. In the night sky In the night sky In the night sky In the night sky It used to be home - Kevin! - Jesus, what? What do you want? Morris. Wake up, sleepy. Holy shit. Did we... Heck, yeah! All night long. (GROWLING) Give it to me again, big boy! This is the greatest day of my life. Hey, Dad. Dad! What are you doing here? You missed your interview, Morris. You blew it, the scholarship, Fieldmont, everything. (SCREAMING) Shit! The interview! Give it up Give it up Give it up Give it up Apparently, Mr. Hooper's a no-show. MORRIS: Thank God! You're still here. I'm sorry I'm late. Now, behind me is the bronze statue of a revolutionary war hero, General W.S. Fieldmont. It has become one of the most sacred landmarks of our time. My life is over. My parents are gonna disown me. - Dude, they probably didn't even notice. - Didn't notice? Did you see my face? (LAUGHING) Yeah, dude, I did. That shit was so funny. Whatever, dude. Just kiss the scholarship bye-bye and move on. And where the hell is Kevin, by the way? You know, he should've been here by now. This is his campus tour. He probably just hooked up last night. At least someone did. You don't think something happened to him, do you? Dude, it's college. What could possibly happen to him? (ALL LAUGHING) Looking good, Kev. A lot hairier than I thought you'd be. - Check it out. - Hey! - Nice diaper! - Looking good, buddy! Okay. This is really embarrassing. Yeah, it's not really the highlight of my day either, Carter. Why would they do this to you? I don't know. Because they can, I guess. There's some clothes in my car. Try... Maybe we should just go home. We're not going anywhere, all right? Not yet. Why not? What are you trying to prove? I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm just trying to have fun. Amen to that! God, I love the new Kevin! You call this having a good time? I'll get back at them. It could have been worse. What could be worse than getting duct-taped naked to a statue all night? Hey, what's up, Gina? It's that boring guy you dumped! Fieldmont rocks! (KEVIN WHOOPING) Dude, maybe the message didn't even send. You know what? Whatever, I'm kind of hoping it did. Really? Well, in that case, let's do like a whole Kevin party series. - We'll post it online... - Yeah, dude, don't push it. Okay. Come on, Morris. Being stuck here isn't the worst thing. You know, I mean, it's probably for the best. How's it for the best? Because if you went home now, you know exactly what would happen. Yeah! Your parents would go ape-shit on your ass for blowing the big interview. And now at least you could probably talk to that Dean Chandler guy. You know, explain what happened. You really think that would work? I think it's worth a shot. What do you have to lose? And you may see that Heather chick again and get more than a half hand job. I think he'll definitely see her again. (CARTER EXCLAIMS) Yeah. (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) By the way, I sort of accidentally told Kendall we were in college last night. Looks like those high school fuckers aren't as stupid as we thought. They got front row seats to nipple city. Motherfuckers! It's part of the whole sorority experience. Fraternities throw parties, and we have charity events. Nice! Are any of them naked? (BLOWING WHISTLE) All right, bitches, you're up! This isn't social hour! So I guess you better go, huh? Yeah, but maybe if you're lucky, we'll let you guys buy us a few beers tonight at Bruno's. - What's that? - A bar. Wait. You guys do go to bars, right? - Bars? Yeah. All the time. - Every day. I'm always at the bar. Just make sure you bring this guy. - This guy? - Me? Yeah, you. Last night was the first frat party I actually enjoyed. Because of me? - Okay. - Well, we'll see you guys tonight then. Hey, I was thinking maybe we could, you know, finish what we started last night. Maybe. Just try not to pass out on me this time. God, that girl fucking rocks. - Kev? - Yeah? On a scale of one to ten, I like boobies at, like, 9,000. Seriously. What's up, fellows? Hey, Kevin! Heard you and the General got a little cozy last night. Jesus Christ! Yeah. Yeah, that was a good one, Teague. Hey, I don't suppose you know what happened to my car, do you? - So that's how it's gonna be, Teague? - That's right, pre-frosh. In fact, we got a job for you three douche bags. What kind of job? Nothing much. We're just gonna need you to clean the house for our party tonight. Maybe wash my car. You know how I like to keep my ride clean. Where did I put them keys? (EXCLAIMING) - Fuck that! No! - Am I sensing some hostility? Wait, are you guys serious? Well, you guys didn't think your room and board were gonna be free here, did you? We're not cleaning your house! No fucking way! Well, maybe your little girlfriends over there would like to find out you guys are still in high school. How do you know we didn't already tell them? Because if you did, they wouldn't be giving you the time of day, you little dicks. Better get to work now, boys! TEAGUE: Pick the keys up. Boom! And Kevin? Kevy? Don't waste your time with Kendall. You don't want my sloppy seconds, do you? Unless you're into that? You fucking sicko! Go inside. Dude, why do we have to clean? Don't they got pledges to do this shit? Dude, I think this weekend we are the pledges. (BEER SONG PLAYING) MAN: (SINGING) Don't let them take it all away I'm down on my luck I'm out on the streets I'm at wit's end I've nearly been beat See they've taken my home They've taken my wife They've taken my job And they've taken my life But there's one thing That they will not take That I will hold till the end Until my dying day 'Cause it's part of me And it's time that we say They will not take it all away! Don't let them take it all away It's getting harder every day Brothers, sisters, hear me say I'm pounding the pavement Through thick and thin Good times and bad I just can't win I've been beat on, kicked on Insulted to my face The whole bleeding world thinks I'm a bleeding disgrace Yeah, they can own my body But they'll never own my mind So they better face the facts 'Cause now is the time Till we all join hands And all of us say They will not take it all away That's really funny. 'Cause I've been cleaning all day, so you think that it'd be funny to come in and throw a cup down. Because I've been working really hard and you want to ruin that for me. I love that! You're just... You're so fucking cool, you bitch. Yeah, get some, you punk-ass bitch! Come here, you steaming fuck! - I don't know if this is a good idea. - You want that scholarship, don't you? Go on. Come on, man! You can do it! I believe in you! You're the coolest, bro! - Yeah, he's totally fucked. Yep. - Yeah, totally. Shit! Run away! Let's just say that this morning was, well, rather shocking. Heck, I didn't even know what some of those words meant. I had to search the Internet for them. But I guess that's what happens when you choose to stay at a frat house, rather than the dorm room we assigned you. I know, sir. It was a bad choice. Christ, if I had my way, I'd kick every fraternity off this campus. Do you know that those animals suck nitrous oxide out of balloons just to get high? Really? That's just awful! (CHUCKLING) Mr. Hooper, there is no doubt that you are academically gifted, but the scholarships we give out here are about much more than just that. Dean Chandler, that's me. My family has a long history at Fieldmont, and I'd like to continue that legacy. Well, you know, son, I guess you're gonna have to prove it to me. For, as of right now, Mr. Hooper, you and your scholarship are hanging by a thread. God! You're so lame! Dude, where have you been? It's go time! Relax! Relax! I just had to run a little errand. All my years of hard work have finally paid off! That's my boy. - Nice. - What's wrong, Morris? What's wrong? I'm having a breakdown, Kevin! Or have you forgotten what that feels like? - I understand, man. - What am I gonna do? Somehow, I have to convince the Dean that I actually want to go here. Well, look, there's nothing you can do about it tonight, all right? - So let's just go get our girls. Here. - This doesn't even look like me. Whatever, Morris. Just tell the bouncer you don't photograph well. Let me see it. Dude, this will totally work! You guys are both just so ugly. You're a little uglier, but it'll be good. Don't worry about it. (LAUGHING) Laquisha? Man, you actually expect me to buy that your name is Laquisha? You know what? I like how you roll, dog. You in. Shit! - Sorry, guys. No dough, no go. - Fuck! Let the ladies through. Let the ladies through. Let the ladies through. - What was that? They didn't pay. - Did you see the size of those racks? - No. - Yeah, you big, big man. You like that when I squeeze them together for you? I said no. I cannot believe those assholes ripped us off. They've done pretty much everything else to us so far this weekend. Why not that? Man, do you think this is what it's going to be like - when we're really in college? - Who knows? Well, we probably won't all be together. I know that. God, Morris, you're such a fucking baby! Would you stop being a girl? - Would you please just shut up? - What? It's true! Think about it, guys. This is it! Senior year. Man, he's right. This is it. You know, all the more of a reason to take advantage of being here. All right, I'm not sitting around. Come on, you guys! Where are you going? What do you think? We've got a frat party to go to. Come on! - What about the girls? - Shut up. (MORRIS GROANING) - It hurts. - Morris, let's go! Come on. - Wait for me! - You're so slow! You're so slow! MAN: (SINGING) I was on my way up She was on her way down And I didn't know I crossed that line Make me sick to my stomach When I think of that woman Sitting in this cell of mine I said, "Goddamn, I'm only a man" Give me 15 years to life Jailbait (JAILBAIT CONTINUES PLAYING) (SLICE OF LIFE PLAYING) GIRL: Come on, cowboy. MAN: Yeah! GIRL: You guys ready to celebrate? All right! Where's my whip? You want to be my bitch, huh? Pass it on. (EXCLAIMS) - Fellows, it's not polite to stare! - What the fuck, man? What's up? Ladies, I want you to meet some very special guests. - Hi, boys. - What's up? - Hi, cutie. - Me? Hi. Wait. You're the Penthouse Pet of the Year. Mmm-hmm. - (STAMMERING) And you're... - On the cover of Penthouse Letters. Fellows! Good for you for staying current. (SIGHS) Where were we? Where were we? Where were... Yeah, that's right. Ladies? These guys were nice enough to pay for all this. Wait a second. That's what you did with our money? You paid for this party? Hey, kegs aren't cheap these days, my man. Neither are the circus animals we got coming later. Wait! You couldn't have paid for this. We didn't even have that much money in our wallets. - Yeah. - Yeah. What's up with that? Luckily, you guys had some plastic. God, my parents gave me that in case of an emergency. Well, good thing they got such a high limit! We almost maxed those puppies out. Especially on this guy. Verne Troyer? - That's Mini-Me. - Verne! - Why do you keep hitting me? Fuck! - Shut up, bitch! Fucking Mini-Me. It was Bearcat's idea. God, I love that guy. Anyhow, we've gotta go be social. You douche bags have fun. Okay? Okay. Babies? That was so weird, but so hot! Dude, she grabbed my nipple! Dude, she twisted my nipple, dude! So, basically, this is our party. - Yeah. In a roundabout way, I guess it is. - Why don't I like where this is going? Come on, Morris! I mean, we paid for it. We may as well enjoy it. - That's my boy! - Come on! Who wants to keg stand? Me! Me! I'm first! I wanna go first! Please. (LET'S GO GET WASTED PLAYING) - Have you ever done one of these before? - No, but it looks like fun, huh, man? Yeah. Real fun. All right, here, make sure you get a good shot. Wait, I thought you didn't want to send Gina any more videos. I changed my mind, all right? Wait till she sees this one. - Nice! - Kev, come on. What's happening? You don't have to do this. Yeah, I do, Morris, all right? And you should lighten up and do one, too. Yeah, fuck nugget. Me? No way. That's a bad idea. - I'm already on thin ice with the Dean. - Whatever! You know what? I think I'm gonna go and find something non-alcoholic to drink. You guys have fun puking on yourselves. Okay. We will, buddy. I love you! Call me later. Be safe. - All right, whatever. Let's do this thing! - All right. Yeah. Be careful with him, guys. He's fragile. Bitches spit, Kev. Bitches spit. - Hey, is there alcohol in there? - In the punch? No, not at all. In fact, this is non-alcoholic for our designated drivers. - Really? - Big old Bearcat wouldn't lie to you. After last night, I feel like we bonded. In fact, if you don't believe me, have a taste. Hey, can I have some punch? Hey, safety first. - Another designated driver. - Thank you. - Wow! It's pretty good. - Drink up, buddy. You look thirsty. Thanks, Bearcat. You're all right. Listen to me. If anybody, and I mean anybody, fucks with you tonight, find me. I got your front. - Don't you mean "back"? - If that's how you want it. If you feel something moving in your pants, don't fight it! Who's fucking on my floor? - Heather! - I know you! GIRL: Hey, Teague, who's the blonde? Hey! Kendall! I'm glad you made it. Let me get you girls some beers. No, thanks, Teague. Not now. If you're looking for who I think you're looking for, don't bother. He's a loser, him and his little friends. Are you really that jealous? You had your chance, Teague, and thank God you blew it. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) - Yeah! - I wanna drink! I wanna drink! - Fuck, yeah! - You are so awesome! - Verne! - Verne! Hey, Verne! - Fuck you, prick! - I love you, too! - Hey, man, did you get that one? - Dude, you fucking drained the thing! - Holy shit. Oh, hey, hey! Look, look! - Ladies! Hey, Kendall! Kendall, hey! What's up, ladies? We were hoping you guys would show up. Yeah, we waited at the bar tonight for, like, two hours. Yeah. Way to blow us off. Amy, girl, you know I'd never blow you off. Especially last night, you know, after the lesbian thing. Hey, hey, look, the bouncer wouldn't let us in, 'cause our IDs sucked. We got in just fine, and we don't even have ID. Yeah, but, see, you guys got tits, and those things are like gold. Hey, but you know what? You know what we're gonna do? Let us make it up to you, okay, 'cause you still need those beers, right? - I think you've had plenty. - Me? Come on! Please! I'm just getting started. All right, well, I'm gonna get you those beers.

He meant that in the nicest way possible. Stop being an asshole, Teague, and give them our beer. So you want some beer for your ladies? All right. You know what? You guys put up with a lot of shit these past couple of days, and you deserve this beer. In fact, hold on. (GROANS) Hey, everybody, listen up! I've got a quick announcement to make! - Lay off, Teague. - Trust me, Kendall. You're gonna love this. See these guys right here? These guys are pre-frosh. (CROWD BOOING) - That's right! They're high school kids! - High school? High school? All right, come on now, once upon a time we were high school kids, too. - No way! - Come on. Grow up! All right, shut up! These guys are cool. They're good guys who want a beer and a good time. Give them one. Here it is. Your beer. What the fuck? Stop peeing on me! What are you doing? Would you fucking stop peeing on me, you little shit? Say what? Nobody talks to my bear kitten like that! What me and him got, you'll never understand. Pick me up, bitch! Stop calling me bitch! This is my frat. You're embarrassing me. And now let's get fucked up! (CROWD CHEERING) - Kendall, wait! - Nice one. - Oh, my word, that was fun. - (LAUGHING) That's not dancing. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) They can't dance. Jim! Look out! - Sweet Jesus! That was close! - Hi! Dean Chandler! Just the guy I wanted to talk to. CHANDLER: Oh, my God! (ALL URINATING) I'm so dead. Yeah, well, at least you didn't get beer poured on you by about 300 people. Yeah, Kendall looked pretty pissed back there, huh? Pissed? Dude, it looked like she was gonna shoot fucking daggers out of her eyeballs. Kev? Kev! Where you going? I'm gonna go apologize. You coming with me? Hey! Shut the fuck up! This is my favorite part! Watch this shit! MAN: Dude. BEARCAT: There's Goose! There's Goose! (LAUGHING) Shit, that's funny! Hey, play that shit again!

Just saying. No way. (KNOCKING ON WINDOW) What? - Can I talk to you alone for a minute? - Why? So you can tell me more lies? - No, thanks. - Hey! Wait! - Come on, I leave tomorrow. - You know, I thought you were different. But you're just like the rest of them. Have a nice drive. College blows! You think I'll ever see Heather again? Probably not, Morris. I pretty much blew it for all of us. So that was my last shot to score with Amy. All I wanna do is bang one college chick this weekend. Is that so much to ask? What the hell? MORRIS: My glasses! My glasses! Get them in the van! Get them in. Get them in. - TEAGUE: You pukes are worthless. - Worthless! Nothing but a bunch of goddamn high school kids! Goddamn high school kids! I can't believe we're even out here wasting our time on you. Wasting our motherfucking time! Dude, what's with the repeating? It's fucking killing me. Sorry! It's stupid. Can I get a hug? Just go stand over there and look fucking mean. Do the growl thing. Come on, man, I'll jeeper creeper these motherfuckers. Hug me. (BARKING) We got beer to drink. So it's been fun, kind of. By the way, have you guys ever seen a pig stampede before? - Fucked up. Pig stampede. - Pig stampede! - ALL: Pig stampede! Pig stampede! - Pig stampede! Pig stampede! - Pig stampede! Pig stampede! - Pig stampede! Pig stampede! - Pig stampede! Pig stampede! - Pig stampede! Pig stampede! (PIGS SQUEALING) BEARCAT: Get out of the front seat, bitch! I called shotgun! (GUN FIRES) Shit! Run! (GROANING) Keep running, you little sicko pig fuckers! (GUN FIRES) This sucks. Yeah, thanks for stating the obvious, Carter. You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I think I actually miss high school. - What, Kevin? - Nothing. Forget it. Don't forget it. If you have something to say, fucking say it! Okay, fine, you want it? Here it is. You're full of shit, Carter! I'm full of shit? Yeah! You're always talking such a big fucking game, man. You know what? Newsflash! He's never even been laid. - So, that's how it's gonna be, huh, Kevin? - No, no, no. Wait. You're still a virgin? - (LAUGHING) Man! This is great. - Yeah, whatever, Morris! Shut up! You know what, Kev? Stop dumping on us 'cause the weekend didn't turn out the way you thought it would! Yeah, probably because I've been listening to you too much. Yeah, 'cause it was my idea to try to prove Gina wrong and lie to Kendall! - That was all you, man! - Guys, come on. Let's not fight. You know what? Stay out of it, Morris! You're not part of this! I'm not part of this? This was supposed to be yours and my weekend here. Dude, whatever. I didn't mean it like that. No, but while we're comparing shitty weekends, here's one for you. My face got written on before my scholarship interview, a pig just snacked on my nuts, and, oh, yeah, I almost forgot about this one, I puked on the Dean's car, which pretty much means that I'm not getting my scholarship! God, Morris! Ever since you got here you whine, whine, whine about your fucking scholarship. You don't even want to go here. It's not about what I want! You know how my parents are! Yeah, well, then grow some fucking balls and stand up to them. It's not that easy. Hey, man, what's next? They're gonna choose what job you take? - What girl you marry? - Dude, lay off, Kev! That's a first. You're sticking up for Morris, man? - You bag on him more than anyone. - That's not true and you fucking know it! Ha! Okay, you know what, Morris? Fuck you! That's the last time I ever have your fucking back! You know what? Fuck you, too, Kevin, for dumping all your bullshit on us. All right, fine, Morris. Yeah, walk away with him. Why don't you hold his hand while you're at it? - Fuck you, Kevin. - Dropping the F-bomb, big man. What is that, the first time you ever used it? I'm telling your parents! Fuck! MAN: (SINGING) We do not know How things work How things work We do not know Where you go In the night Through the door Through the door that holds you Through the door that holds you Out of the blue We do not know The door that holds you Silent as glue We stand under it But we don't understand it The door that holds you Silent as glue And stars fall on Stars fall on Silent as glue - Nice look. - This? Yeah, thanks. So... - Look, about what happened... - Don't even go there. - Just let me explain. - I really don't want to hear it, Kevin. I don't even know who you are. Yeah, to be honest, I'm not even sure I know anymore. Maybe it's time you figure that out. You know, high school, college, it wouldn't have mattered to me. Yeah, I know. It's so stupid. You know, I came down here thinking I needed to change who I was. Lying to you was just part of it. I thought you were pretty great. Why would you want to change that? I don't know. You don't know? Like, I mean, I kind of liked who I was, or I am. You know, a little uptight at times, responsible. God, I really screwed up this weekend. You know, now Morris and Carter are pissed at each other. They're both pissed at me. You just seem like the kind of person who doesn't make mistakes. Ha! A couple weeks ago... Brace yourself. I hooked up with Teague. - Huge mistake. - Yeah, he kinda told me. Why not? He told the whole campus. Why'd you do it? I mean, with a guy like Teague? - He is so... - For all the wrong reasons. He was good-looking. He made me feel special, and since he was a really good liar, he made believe that it was more than just a one-night thing. - Ouch. - Yeah. It was kind of why I freaked out tonight. I found out that you lied and I assumed that you were just like Teague. Oh, God, please, look, I'm nothing like that guy. I'm really sorry about everything. Is this the real Kevin talking? Or is this the new and improved college Kevin talking? No, this is the real me, the uptight, responsible, un-fun high school one. Good. Apology accepted then. All right, well, I gotta go find Carter and Morris. Before you go, can I please give you some clothes? - Morris? Morris, wake up! - Kevin? - What's with the... - Where's Carter? Look, you guys. I've been thinking all night. I just want to say I'm sorry about everything. - You said some harsh things, man. - Yeah, I know. I've realized a lot about myself this weekend, and you guys. I didn't mean what I said. I've just been so hung up on what Gina told me that I haven't even stopped to think that, you know, maybe she was wrong. You guys are my best friends. I'm not gonna let some stupid weekend at college ruin that. Whatever, man. It's cool. I like the boring Kevin more anyway. Thanks, Carter. I think. Morris? We all said some stuff, you know? No biggie. I'm over it. Sorry I, like, freaked out and lost my shit. You guys, that was so gay. That was like the third gayest thing we've done this weekend. - It's getting out of hand. - All right, look. Does this mean we're cool? Yeah, man. For sure. Okay! So now that we're done arguing like a bunch of chicks, - what the hell are we doing out here? - Go ahead and look for yourselves. - Is that all our stuff? - Yeah. - They even threw in all our rubbers. - Those taint-sucking ball junkies. Yep. - Can we go home now? - No. Not yet. - Dude, why the fuck would we stay? - The weekend's over, Kevin. It's pretty clear we're not wanted here anymore. Come on, you guys. We've got to stand up for ourselves. No, we don't. We need to go home. Come on, man. After all the shit we've been through? We can't leave like this, Morris. Besides, I can't stand up to these fraternity assholes on my own. All right, fuck it! If I'm not gonna get laid, I might as well get revenge, right? Come on, Morris. We can't do this without you. Come on, man. Just think about it. Who wrote "hairy balls" on your face? - Fraternity guys. - Yeah. Who made you wash their car, drink out of some dude's belly button and puke all over the Dean's car? CARTER: Who stripped you naked and made you feel like a little bitch all weekend long? - Fraternity guys! - Yeah, that's right, the fraternity guys. Look, man, you want to stand up to your parents? Why don't you start by taking a stand here first? Let's take those motherfuckers down. Fuck! One, two. - Four, five... - Dude, open the door! Get over here! (GROANING) Five, four, three, two... (SHOUTING) - Dude, are you sure this is going to work? - Trust me. It's physics. Fuck. - What the fuck? - Nothing's happening. Maybe the matches blew out. (BEEPING) (ALARM RINGING) What the... Shit! Fuck! What the fuck? Fucking pig! Fucking shit! (PIG SQUEALING) Oh, shit! - What the fuck is happening? - There's pigs everywhere! Fuck me! God damn it! What the fuck? It's beer! It's fucking beer, man! (SIRENS BLARING) Hey, you guys, you got to come outside! I think the Beta Chi House is on fire or something. Fuck you, pig! Nice hair cut, buddy! - Bearcat. - Wait! Wait! Can I flush first, guys? Come on! You boys are in a world of shit now. Disturbing the peace, destruction of property, stealing farm animals! What the hell are you talking about? It wasn't us! - It was those fuckers right there! - Officer, we don't even go here. No. We're just a bunch of high school kids. You know, Officer, frankly, I'm appalled at the behavior on this campus. Motherfuckers! Fuck you! Careful there, buddy. You've got a little cut from a straight razor on your nipple. Wait, wait! Wait! - Where's my car? - MAN: Plastic pussy stole it! Where's my fucking car? This was donated by a group of our alumni. This has made a very welcome addition to our campus. And I'm sure that your child will embrace their studies... Why don't we go ahead, guys? Just follow me. Come on, guys. CARTER: So, wait. You're in high school? AMY: Yeah. I just came here to visit for the weekend, like you guys. - But you even drink like a college girl. - Really? Thanks. - So I guess this is it, huh? - Well, it doesn't have to be. Carter! Spank me, tiger! Yeah! - I guess I better... - Morris. Think you're gonna go here next year? After this weekend, I kind of feel like I already do. Plus, I already have a girlfriend lined up, so... Yeah? And who's that? Someone I met. She plays a mean game of quarters. So I guess that means I'll be getting my photography lessons after all. - So that's everything. - I guess we should get on the road. Wait. You know what? Hang on. All right, guys. Let's go home. Here comes trouble. - Hey, Kevin. - Hey, Gina. So I got your video message. Looks like you guys had a pretty crazy weekend. Hell, yeah! - Yeah! - Breath mint. (GIGGLING) Anyway, well, it kind of made me think a lot about you and me and, you know, us. Why don't we just forget this whole break-up thing ever happened? What do you say? Well... You know, I don't think so. - What? - Yeah, you see, I've moved on. Moved on? We've only been broken up for, like, three days. Yeah, well, a lot can happen in three days. And, Gina, that guy you saw? Yeah, that's not really me. Well, see you around. And get a boob job, Gina. Lift. Kevin! Wait! Seriously! So what do you guys want to do next weekend? Next weekend? Aren't you grounded for, like, the next six months? Fuck that! No problem. I can just sneak out. You know, I've got a cousin that goes to U of I. I'll pay you $5 a sniff, either one of your farts. I just want to cherish your gaseous fumes. It can be a birthday present. My birthday's coming up! Yeah! Lost my shoe. (BOYS LAUGHING) Dude, you gotta see the shots I got from last night's game. I got one where Stoloff is mid-air right over the inset... Insectercide? Whatever the hell... What the... (STAMMERING) Dean Chandler has denied our petition, and we're still on probation. - Shit. - Yeah. WOMAN: Okay, cut! (ALL LAUGHING) Our camping trips? Our... The school... Thing that was awesome that we did together. Remember that? It was you and me. What's the line? Looks like my years of hard work have finally paid off! KEVIN: What's the matter, Morris? - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I've taken some whip-its, you know, the cracker shit. (ALL LAUGHING) Whatever, man. You guys are lightweights. I don't feel shit. - Mom's a lightweight. - Here... Fuck you, dude! Well, it doesn't have to be. (CREW LAUGHING) Is that our stuff? Yeah. They even threw all our rubbers in. Those scrotum-eating baby rapers. Those taint-sucking ball junkies. (ALL LAUGHING) Those jizz-guzzling monkey fuckers. You sucked in Austin Powers. Mike Myers carried you. You didn't even say nothing, bitch. Dude, you're doing it wrong, anyway. You gotta flip it, bitch. Fucking beat you... (CREW CHEERING) Dude, this is so much better than the brochure. I know, man. I've got a good feeling about this. - I'm sorry, K.B. just said he had a boner. - He said he had a boner. WOMAN: Can we cut? Cut. I've got to ask you a favor. You know that book about the mice that Miss Dangle is asking everybody to read? - That's way too much cereal. - MAN: Swallow. Twin powers, activate! Form of a screaming... Screaming manimal! (SCREAMING) Bearcat's gay and he wants to do me I'm gonna punch his face And then he'll sue me I'm going home with pussy on my pee-pee Gonna tell my friends That college is the shitty, yeah Eat that shit WOMAN: And cut! (CREW CHEERING)
