I can't hold back anymore. I'm going inside for a little. Are you ready? You're ready? In. Place your bets. Odd or even? How about you? Even. Place your bets. Odd or even? What'll it be, odd or even? Odd or even? How about you? Will you go odd or even? It's definitely even. Okay. Even it is. Odd. Odd and even. The bets are in. Match is... Odd with one. No! No! Stop! Help me! Don't shoot! I win. What are you? You're dressed so cute. Why is there a blade at the tip of your umbrella? What? I don't understand a word he's saying! What the hell are you saying? That's right! What the hell are you saying? Speak Japanese. Yeah, idiot! Speak Japanese. Do you hear me, you bastard? Don't fuck with me! You brute! Get up! Shut up! This is my gambling den. Don't be causing trouble! Don't be acting fresh, you bitch! Who are you calling bitch? You. I'll crush this stinking den! Just give up! Everyone! My apologies for the disturbance. Continue to have fun! Seems like we have another idiot in the house. Who are you? I'm here to execute you. Whoever you are, I admire your courage. You won't be leaving here alive. Prepare yourself! First Execution Sakie Don't hold back guys! What the hell are you guys doing! Give it your all! Can't believe... I've been defeated. Who the hell are you? I didn't forget about you for a second. I've done many bad things. How am I supposed to remember everything? Then figure it out slowly in Hell. I hand down the verdict in the name of God. Thou art not guilty. Kayako... Dad. Yuki, are you okay? You're not hurt? No. How was the umbrella? Were there any imperfections? No, all went well. That's good. I'm glad. One down. Hey, Dad... You think... Mother is pleased with the fact I killed her? Yes. She must be. Congratulations. Thank you! Congratulations. Okay, where are my gifts? Gifts? Is that a demand? Oh, well. Here you go. Thank you. It's from the both of us. Thank you. - Can I open it? - Of course. I wonder what it is. You'll see. What is it? Ta-dah! Thank you! You've been asking for it. I've been wanting one. It's in style now. How do I look? It looks good. Should I change into it now? Hey, Yuki. Would you always stay the kind girl that you are? Of course I will. That's true. What a weird question. Let's eat. Let's eat. Let's eat! Dad, you cut it. Let's take these off... Dad... Dad! Mother! Let go! Mother! No! No! Yuki! Mother! Yuki! Mother! Yuki! Mother! Yuki! Mother! Yuki! No! Mother! Mother! Today, I'll show you my superpower. Watch carefully. Shut up, shut up! Shut up! If you're all screaming, I can't concentrate. Then hurry up and bend it! You shut up and watch. I'll do it this time. Watch carefully. That's so gross, you pervert! Don't look! I said don't look! Shut up! That's it for today! Don't say what! When I say we're done, we're done! Stop pestering me. Just go home, brush your teeth, and go to sleep. Listen, this is going to be on the test next week. Study it! You girls are the three stooges, so make sure to study. Ouch! That hurts. Stop that! I'm your teacher! Listen up, hurry and go home. Damn school girls. No respect. They don't know how to respect a teacher. Oh crap, oh crap! Superpower my ass! He should die! Did you see his underwear? So gross! What? That was terrible. Kids these days don't know how to clean up. They need to clean up! What the hell is this? Who is it? Stop hiding and come on out. You're confessing your love to me? Just kidding! I know you're here. Come on out. You startled me. Oh man! You're still alive? Since that day, I've lived to get revenge on you. Why did you kill my mother? I see... You don't know. I'll tell you one thing. You'll soon be murdered by me. Second Execution Uri Gelleo Let's do it. Look left then go left. Like that? No way. I hand down the verdict in the name of God. Thou art not guilty. Yuki... Yuki. Yuki. Yuki. Yuki. Where's Mother? Don't look. Don't look! Mother? Mother? Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Yuki. Yuki. Dad. Are you okay? Thanks. Second one down. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for leaving everything to you. If these legs moved... I feel pathetic. No. Because you're here, I can work hard. Yuki. Let's go home. We're gonna beat you! He's penniless! We're gonna beat you! Please stop... You shit! My bike... My bike! It cost me a fortune! My bike! It cost me a fortune! Get lost. Who are you? We'll beat you up! That's right! That's right! That's right! Z! We are... Kamikaze! We'll beat you up! Yeah! We'll beat you up! Bring it on. We'll beat you up! It hurts! Oh, it hurts! Don't underestimate us! It's a fight! It's boton hunting! You okay? Let's get her! It hurts! It hurts... Focus! Stand up! Bite hard. Focus! Bite hard. It hurts. It really hurts... It really hurts... Get lost. We are... Kamikaze! My glasses... My glasses... Where are my glasses? Thank you so much. I don't know who you are. But thank you so much. I've come to execute you. Third Execution Nightwatch I'm okay. I've come this far. I should be okay. Why... Why now? I'm sorry! I'm really sorry! I'm very sorry! I know I've done a terrible thing to you. Even if I apologize I deserve no forgiveness. But... But please listen to me. That day, I had no intentions of helping with murder. It's the truth! I specialized in opening safes. I was just told to unlock the door to your home. That was the only reason why I joined in. Why did you kill my mother? I didn't! I didn't kill her! I was just a hired hand. Don't you remember? I didn't do anything. I didn't kill her! Please believe me. There was nothing I could do. I didn't do it. Please! Please don't kill me! Since that day, I haven't seen any of them. I've washed my hands clean and now I work like everyone else. I have a wife and a son. He's going to turn two. They're my precious family I finally got a hold of. I understand how you must feel. But without me, my son... My family will end up on the street! I'm begging you. Please... If you have any compassion... Please. Please don't kill me. I swear... I swear I'll make up for it for the rest of my life. So please forgive me! I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Please don't kill me. Please. Please don't kill me! I threw away compassion a long time ago. Please. Don't kill me. Don't kill me! Don't. I don't want to die. You guys took my mother away... And I've... I've suffered for a really long time, too. That's so awful! What an enraged outcry. He was apologizing so much. You didn't have to kill him, did you? You are? Ta-dah! I'm Elle! Hey, I'm gonna show you something awesome, so hold up a second! Wonder where I put it... There they are. Fourth Execution Lady Elle I'm going to chop you up good. Hello? Ah, there you are, Miss Gothic Lolita! Die! It's a heart shape just like mine! Elle kick! Bam! Huh? It's not fair to disappear! What am I supposed to do? Oh well... I'm hungry anyway. I wonder if she's embarrassed about her costume. I should have taken a picture! Mother... You're awake. Stay still. I'm okay. Look, you're still hurt. I said I'm okay! Look, you're still hurt. Yuki. I took care of the third one. But... The fourth one attacked me. I see. Meaning they know who we are now... Dad... I... I saw a dream. A dream? Yes. Mother was crucified... And her face looked like... It was just a dream! You're probably seeing scary dreams because your body is tired. You should get some rest now. - But... - Ta-dah! Look out! Dad! Once again, it's me, Elle! Dad! I'm okay. Come on out, Gothic Lolita! I didn't come here to play hide and seek with you! Seriously, where are you? Oh, there you are! Wait up, damn it! Don't you run from me! Oh no, I lost her. Damn it! Where are you? Yuki. Yuki! Gothic Lolita, where are you! C'mon! Where did you go! Use this. What are you doing? Wow! Bitch! I'll kill you! Damn it! It wasn't supposed to take this long! You're so dead! You've got to be kidding! Don't underestimate me, bitch! Die! Die! It's your darling. Bang! Hey, Yuya... You're at karaoke? I want to join you, too! Where, which one? Shibuya? I'm a little busy right now. Don't you interrupt me! Sorry, Yuya. You didn't hear any guy's voice. There's a gothic lolita chick right in front of me. I'll take a picture. Say cheese! There you go. Hello? Hello? Hello, Yuya? Sorry. I did take a picture but I couldn't send it to you. I'll send it to you later. Yeah, that's right. You know the new all you can eat shabu shabu restaurant in Shibuya? Hold on. Shut up! Hello? Sorry about that. I think it was 1,980 yen and all you can eat. Let's go soon. Ew, this bread tastes awful! I think it's gone bad. This tastes awful, too! Trying to kill me? I said shut up! I'm sorry, Yuya. This is the worst bread I've ever had. Okay, I'll be right over. I'll be done soon. How long till I can get there? Maybe three minutes? It may take a little longer. Maybe about five minutes? Although I'm dumb, so I might get lost. Then it'll take longer. Really? I want to see you too, Yuya. I want to see you. I really do. What! Me cheating? No way! I just told you I want to see you! Are you not listening? I told you before. That's the gothic lolita's voice... I hand down the verdict in the name of God. Yuya... Yuya... My cell phone... Hello, Yuya? What? You want to break up? Why? I just got dumped. It's hilarious. Thou art not guilty. You're just like your mother. Of course. You have the same blood running through you. Hey, sorry. I went too far. I'm totally in love with you. Hey, are you listening? Totally head over heels for you. Aren't I awesome? Hey, are you listening to me? I'm totally in eccentric love with... Yuki? Just one more... If we execute just one more person, then it will be over. Let's stop this. It's enough. I lost my wife. I don't want to lose you as well. Dad! Yuki. I can't stand watching you get hurt any longer. We stop now. There's only one of them left. If I can avenge my mother's death, I don't care if I die. Yuki! Yuki! Yuki! Welcome. I'm the last one. Yuki. Fifth Execution Masato When you kill me, you avenge your mother's death. Why did you kill her? Huh? You still don't get it? I will tell you when you kill me. You shall be executed. Poor thing. You still don't know how to use your power. That's no fun for me. Let's play a game. I shall awaken your true self. Yuki. Dad! Look up. Okay... The game starts now! Yuki! Don't worry about me. I don't want to make you suffer any more. Yuki! Yuki! Look. The game has started. Come on, come on! Don't let go of that rope. Come on! You can't defeat me that way. What's the matter? Come on, come on! Yuki! If we keep this up, both of us will die! Let go of the rope Yuki! I said let go of it! Yuki, let go! Forget about me! Yuki! I see. So this is what you use. I'm impressed you killed four of us. Yuki! Let go of the rope! Come on. Let's play! Yuki! Yuki, I said let go! Hey, what's wrong? Let's play more! Stop! I said play with me. Stop! I said play with me. Please stop! Stop! That's enough! Let go! Let go, Yuki! Yuki! Yuki! Let's finish this. Come to think of it, your mother had the same eyes as you. Yuki! Yuki! Yuki! Dad! You're beautiful! This is the form that I wanted to see! Look. This is my reward for killing so many devils. Each one of them holds a memory. Look. Here's your mother's crest. She was a wonderful devil. Come on. You're also going to live inside me. Aren't you honoured? Seems like you still don't get it. Then I get to go first. I almost got you. I'm going to die soon. But your fight isn't over yet. I'll be waiting for you in Hell... Yuki. Yuki... I'm sorry. I will always watch over you. Thank you. Dad. Mother. I hand down the verdict in the name of God. Thou art not guilty.
