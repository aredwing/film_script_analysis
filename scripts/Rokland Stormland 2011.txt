Poet? - Yes, I'm a poet. A school teacher and poet has taken a young woman and a doctor hostage. You have a blog, Stormland on which you said you were going to start a bloody revolution. This society... It is locally anesthetized. You are all so worried about your money. But not that you are spiritually bankrupt. You live in a land the world envied and you let a few Banksters destroy it. All you ask your politicians is not to take your flat-screen TVs from the mansions you couldn't afford in the first place! One year earlier. Saudakrokur pop. 2741 The higher you climb the smaller you are in the eyes of those who envy you. No. The higher you fly the smaller you look in the eyes of the flightless. Yes, Nietzsche. Grettir. He was a great hero. The only thing he feared was Glaimur the ghost. He made mistakes like all of us. He had a few regrets. He was a hot-tempered guy. Misunderstood. Some would call him an anti-hero. Finally he was betrayed by a witch. A woman. That happens. Who ordered a pizza? Did anyone order a pizza? I thought it would arrive during recess. Then I guess we'll wait until recess. Somebody needs to pay for it. Piss off. You wait if you want your money. When Grettir wasn't slaying men or ordering pizza... You're a great teacher, but this obsession needs to stop. And I won't allow this class trip to Drangey. I just want to show them Grettir's cave. Show them how real heroes lived. I'm sorry Boddi. The school board thinks it's unsafe. Hi. - Hi. How's the book going? When's it in stores? My book? Probably around Christmas. Called "Grettir and Nietzsche, At the edge of civilization: Musings from a vagrant - Book one." No, I'm fucking with you. It's a romantic comedy. Ok. Are you a romantic? I'm an incurable romantic. Yeah right. But I'm on this new medication that keeps me stable. Hi. Hello. Are you alone? Come and sit with rni Valur and me. I'm working. I hope dad isn't working you too hard. You'll come tonight? Maybe. You know where we are. The great men of the past were not limited by other people. They sought to uplift the spirits of others. The great men of our times do the complete opposite Instead of helping others fly they keep them down. Universal stupidity is in their interest. We at Iceland Bank want to help protect the environment. When you open a savings account with us, we'll plant 4 trees... Your brother Viddi is always in the commercials. Isn't Viddi divorced? - He is? He never calls. Get rich all day, Barbecue all night. This is Bddi, the Stormlander. His brother is... You know, the TV actor. Viking Group. Oh, Vidar? Exactly. Viddi. Get rich all day, and Barbecue all night. You know what happens when you put a big engine in a small boat? You can't control it. Yes, but it's no better when the engine is too small. The boat just hangs around the pier and never gets out of the harbour. What the fuck do you mean? Then you're just lukewarm, you know? Like your mother used to be except for that one time when you were conceived. - Mother? What the fuck do you know about her? What the hell? Stop it, Manni. Let me go. Keep playing. The dance isn't over. Keep on. - Call an ambulance. What? - Call an ambulance! The total number of fools in this town is 2741. Multiply that with all the other towns in the world and you get millions of fools. Not one of them matters in history. In this town they care more about raising horses than people. A generation of children is hooked on junk culture because schools deny them the education they deserve. Dear blogosphere, from now on I ignore what they want me to do. Starting today I teach my own curriculum, starting with a field trip to Drangey where Grettir was exiled. Here he was murdered by lowlifes, who kicked him when he was down. Grettir didn't call for a rescue helicopter even when he was dying. Even on his knees he killed many men before they got to him. When Grettir wasn't slaying men he performed great acts of courage. He swam to Drangey in the middle of winter carrying a lit torch. - What? B?var, Albert needs to speak to you. Helga Sjfn, I'm teaching. He wants to speak to you now. Great. $25,000? What, was Bono aboard? It's not like it took them the whole day. It was two minutes. Bono costs more than $25,000. The Coast Guard helicopter costs $4000 an hour. Can't I just pay it? Or her dad? Tony Group, I mean, her dad has fleeced the nation. That's the thing. We're not getting the bill. The nation pays. It was a school trip. No. It wasn't a school trip. I'm sorry, but... I have to fire you. Are you exiling me? - You can write your book full time. It's finished. This is the only bloody place I can work. I'm sorry. Oh, Nietzsche. They're all spineless wonders. It's always the same. Always fighting the whorish tendencies of the herd. Nothing like being your own man. You'll see. When the book is published it will all change. Yes, good morning, Sigurjn Saemundsson. B?var Steingrmsson. I've left three messages for him. B?var Halldr Steingrmsson. Regarding the book about Grettir and Nietzsche. Well, he has to call me soon. The nation needs this book. Yes, just tell him that. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. Your choices are limited by the society you're stuck in. Principal Albert on the other hand was merely stuck in his own fat. He was so obese that he couldn't exit his own office. He had a fat wife. They lived in a fat house in the town of Meathook. The trees in their garden were skinny. Mrs Albert wanted fat trees too so she watered them with Coke all day. Hi. - Hi. Biba, I'll have a beer. Is that the band? - Yes. How do you like it? Are they playing here every night? They're the greatest. Sokkat. You don't understand. It's their humor. They've got great humor. - That's a good point. Nothing wrong with some humor on the dancefloor. Exactly. I'm thinking of having a gay ball when it gets darker. I don't want anyone seeing them doing each other. Are you fucking with me? You're thinking of doing Lra Maria? No. Sex is Hitler. Starts with an invasion and ends in a dark bunker. Yes, bunker. Her mom is quite fine. I've always wanted to do her. But there's no way. Lra Maria watches her like a Doberman and gives her Prozac with cream. I can get you a job in the youth program. I've got a job. I'm a poet. Yes, but that doesn't pay the bills. Not now anyway. I'll fix it, no worries. Bddi, get out of there! That's my private bathroom. Relax Keli. Bddi! Get your ass downstairs! I don't want to go with you. Quit your whining. Here's our ride. - Cool. Have you got a light? Come on. Are you kidding? Have you got everything? Down with your trousers. - What? Get undressed. - What? Down with your trousers. - No. Are you a coward? Come on, cowboy. That's a helicopter. - What? Behind us. - A helicopter? Isn't it Tony Group or something? It's all right. I've fucked him. Bend over like you're looking for something. Looking for something? - Yes. Fuck you. That was great. Why are you so pissed off? Well, now you're pregnant. That would be great. I've always dreamt of being a single mother. You're kidding. - No. Give you a ride home? - No, I'll just walk. Thanks for the fuck. See you. Thanks for the show. Welcome to the Dagga Friendship Society. You'll be invited to our yearly feast. It will be held in the Riding Hall. At least I don't have to pay for a fuck. You broke my girl's leg, you bastard. I thought you had all gone bankrupt. No, we're not all losers. We don't all live with our mothers. The country is being sold for peanuts. Know what I'm thinking of doing? - What? Opening a Disneyland in Thingvellir. And you know what? - What? I can. Have you gone crazy? What's wrong with you? What do you mean? - What do I mean? My mom "watered the trees with Coke"? Have you gone nuts? Take it down right away. You can't blog like this about my family. Having just slept with me. It's disgusting. I wrote this before we fucked. After your dad fired me. What's the problem? What's the problem? Please. Find another way to get revenge. Come on. It was just a joke. No, a joke is funny. This is just mean and nothing else. Nobody reads it. Why do you blog if you think no one reads it? This could end up in the papers. It's just a metaphor. - Metaphor my ass. What's that? A metaphor? - Yes. A simile. When things get a different meaning from before. For example, a table leg. Table leg? And what does the word "fat" then mean here? You can interpret it as you like. You can't do this to us. I can't change it. I'm not for sale. Not for money or tears. Maybe I'll metaphor a description of what it's like to sleep with you. On Skagafjrdur.com. What? And describe in detail how you do it. You're trying to censor my blog. Am I not a free man? In a free land on a free Internet? I'll look at it. - You'd better. Do we have to work in this rain? Of course not. Are you mental, Aron Freyr? Grandpa always said it was no use raking wet hay. Your granddad was a nutter and never in the youth program. He was just a lazy farmer. Do you think Grettir thought about the rain when he swam to Drangey? - Grettir who? You're from here, Brimar Sr and you don't know Grettir? Get out. Work. Green with yellow bulbs and multitudes of wild roses the land bows down to a still water. And swimming swans drunk with kisses dip their heads in holy water. Oh, B?var. Did you come to visit me? Or Lra? Just to work in the garden, remember? I need a garden hose. Isn't it raining? - Not anymore. Well. What are you doing here? Watering the garden. - Why are you in here then? Why aren't you out in the garden? I was just... I was going to connect the hose in the laundry. It's good I bumped into you. I want to dedicate a poem I wrote to you. Get the fuck out. What? - Get the fuck out. Bddi. - Fuck off. You're crazy. You going to the concert? - What? In Tallinn. The fucking good times are tempting. But after the mega party you end up spewing in an abortion wishing you'd never been born. Stuck in this fucking hellhole. Forever. He's crazy. Am I only a semen provider? Is that a problem? Do you want anything more? Yes, why not? You're not father material. Not the type. Spend all your days grumbling on the net. I'm writing. I'm a poet. Writing, grumbling. It doesn't matter when you have to change diapers or pay the bills. So you don't want my help. The role of father wouldn't be your strongest suit. You're a great guy. But not quite in touch with reality. And I don't need assistance. Well Dagga, congratulations on your child. It was the year 1022. Grettir smundarson swam from Drangey to Reykjanes after the sun set. He came to a farm and lay in its hot spring as he was quite cold. He baked there the whole night and then went in. It's beautiful, kids. To understand Grettir's Saga you must be bitten by the cold. Then jump in the hot pool after. You boys first. "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger" Nietzsche said. Get in. Okay. - Come on. Fuck, it's cold! I once went much deeper. - Really? I can't now. I've got glasses. Glasses? If you want to impress the girls you have to show them you're a real man. Show them why your name is Brimar Saer. What are you doing? Are you crazy? What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Are you nuts? Are you crazy? What's wrong with you? I'll tell dad. You'll be exiled from the family. I don't care if you fucked Dagga. A youth was in danger near Grettir's pool at four this afternoon. Witnesses say the youth program leader B?var Steingrmsson was showing the boy how Grettir the Strong swam from Drangey to the mainland. These pictures show the severity of B?var 's methods. B?var lost his teaching job after his student broke a leg on a field trip to Drangey last spring. We couldn't get hold of B?var today. The boy has pneumonia. You almost drowned him. He won't be able to go to the Funfest. Maybe he will slim down then. Hey, mate. Open the door, you bastard. Open the door. Has he read the book yet? Is he dyslexic or what? You don't have to change one letter in this book. It's not a bloody crime novel, you know. It's a self-help book for life itself. You have to profit no matter what? It is quite clear. It has to be published before Christmas. Yes, do that. What? Oh, hi. You deliver mail today? What? No. I have to go. Hello there. Did we get mail? - It's December 26th. I met the postman, Lra Maria. Yes, exactly. The mail came. Joke. Hey, I've had a crazy idea. Well? - I was thinking. We should do a film about this place. This town. A movie? - Feature film. You'll write the script. You're great at that stuff. And I'll do the rest. We'll do something that matters. And make some money. Maybe once the book's published. Wasn't it supposed to come out before Christmas? My fucking publisher only understands low culture. He lives on crime novels the bastard. He knows what he's doing. The money has to come from somewhere. If you can't profit from low culture how will you finance the high culture? Put on some pants. What, does this make you uncomfortable? I'm hungry. - Do I threaten you? Always hungry. Silla at the fish factory is going to be a grandmother. Dagga, she's expecting a child. They're not celebrating the paternity. That's a load of crap. I'm the father. Really? - Yes. That's what she said. This can happen. Is she going to let us see it? I would think so. And are you happy about it? I think so. - That's nice. Men are not that into children. I thought you had waterballs. Hello, mate. - Hello. How are you? - Fine. No weight gain over Christmas? No? Cool. When's the book being published? Soon. Dad? - Yes, dear. Thank you. See you tomorrow. OK. Goodbye, mate. Is dad here? He opened his eyes as soon as you came. Isn't he cool? Yes, he's cool. Just great. - Yes, he is. Taking difficult circumstances into account. Don't you think he looks like dad? No, he's much cuter. Viddi, how many kids do you have? Five creatures, man. With four women. I had a family portrait taken the other day. It was spectacular. With all the kids? - Yes. And all the women? - Yes. Together. - Yes. It was brilliant. Took a bit of time but we did it in the end. You have to get something for the payments. I'm always paying something. Why do you think I'm doing those commercials? You have to start behaving like a man. I'm trying, man. It's the bloody women. They won't leave me alone. There is something else. If we're going to work together I have to tell you something. Completely confidential. Yes. I'm a sex addict. No really, it's a disease. I went to a meeting. It was really hard. Loads of hot chicks there. Babes all over. It's like they say, man. One day at a time. I can't do this, Viddi. I have to have a beer. Of course. A new dad. I always go straight to the bar from the maternity ward. Christmas is over. The last day of Christmas. No mercy, boys. Have some. It's quality champagne. Are you still sober, Keli? - Yes, I can't touch it. It ends with mental disease or death. But congratulations. - Cheers. Dagga is great fun. A great girl. I once had a guy from the Faroe Islands here. I think his name was, Jgvan. he had Dagga on the brain. He fucked her mercilessly in every room. I charged him for at least three. I collected screwing tax from him. Congratulations. Biba. Why are you speaking English? - She speaks English. She was raised in the capital, you asshole. Company, I see. Girls. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Hey, it's time. Happy birthday to you. No, stop it. Happy birthday to you. January 7th. Too bad she didn't give birth after midnight. Congratulations, dear brother. So it's his birthday too. Let's have a big party. Cheers. It's no special achievement to make it through one more year. I've gone to rehab once a year since I came here. Apart from one year. Then I went two years in a row. No mercy. Cheers. To women and horses, and the men who ride them! Cheers. Mom. Dear mom. Dear mom. Dear mom. Hey. Biba is very agile. Have you done her? It's like a trip to India. She does this trick with her tongue and it's just... bombs away. What's up? She's just died in the chair. Fucking TV. Mom. Dear mom. Mommy. Bombs away. Viddi. - Yes. You get the award for best acting. Why? - It was very good. I mean, you didn't even know her. Really well done. For the first time in your life. Is everything a fucking joke to you? Are you completely emotionless? Can't you take anything seriously? Fucking get out. Fucking idiot. I want to be alone with mom. Fuck off. I was going to give it to mom before I headed south again. Now it's too late. Nobody knows what he has until it's too late. Win some, lose some. TV killed mom. Since we got a color TV in August 1981 every night and all weekend she saw everything that ever aired on TV. For 28 years she watched all the news, series, soaps, live events, commercials and the lotto. She once had four numbers in the lotto, won $2500 and bought her dream object, the great flat-screen TV. Mom's cause of death was Hollywood pictures with their loose storylines which gradually tightened around her neck, choking her to death. Have a nice trip. Dear mom. Is something wrong? We have to talk. The thing is that Tony, Tta's Tony, he wants to buy the house. Tony Group? - Yes. We have to sell. Everything else is completely illogical. And Tony wants a beautiful summer house. Which is total respect. And... And he wants to pay Get it? For that you can get a great apartment in the capital or go to Germany and live like a king for years. Do you have enough to pay me my share? Aren't we going to christen the child? I'm thinking of Albert Sturla. Albert like my father, he has been so good to us. And Sturla is a promise to an old friend. My love. I was thinking about Grettir. Grettir. No, come on. I've been thinking... thinking about whether we shouldn't, you know... Be together. What? - Be together. You know, be a family. - Family? Yes, that's best for him. - Best for him? We could live together in Stormland. It's such a big house. Those who have a kid together should be together. Don't misunderstand me. I'm not in love with you or anything. -Really? No, don't think that. I mean, we don't even have to sleep together. Just a living arrangement. Two bedrooms. We can sleep together as well. What do you want? Blowjobs in the bathroom? No, I'm just saying I've had enough of bullshit. I want my son to be a part of a family. I want him to have a dad. I thought you were in love. Doesn't Lra Maria want to move from her mom's? She's just some video bitch. Video bitch? You know I only want to be with you. You're nice, funny and... - Funny? You can't just use me to get you pregnant and then just be... free. We have to stay together. That's how it is. No. - Yes. No, I don't want to. Fine. Great. I'll move in here then. I'm here. What's for dinner? Is that it? You're hungry? You're looking for a new mother? No, I'm just thinking about the kid. Do you even know what size diaper he uses? Society is a party you can't leave. You're always there. Stuck in a fucking party. Alone in a corner looking at books while everyone else dances in the living room. I can't dance because the only one I want to dance with is watching her mother. I walk the streets alone as a loveless citizen in the state of love. Yes, yes. Dear friend. Yes, we stand together. Strong together. Bddi and Grettir. The outlaws. Did you see what grandma did for you? Yes, yes. Why don't you answer down there? Are you avoiding me? Has he slept for long? - No, he woke twice. I just fed him and he was all right. Fed him? What did you feed him? Skim milk. - Are you nuts? What, is that not OK? - No. You give him formula if he can't get breastmilk. Milk with nicotine, you mean. Yes, are you watching your grumpy father? He's so cute. Looks a bit like you. Grumpy. Is Tony going to move in? - No. It's some kind of confirmation gift. First he fucks you, then he fucks me. Come on. I paid 400 grand for this. I don't know why. You know. Because I called you. - No. You know why, B?var. Because you can. - That's right. I didn't have to. It's not like I need it. It's a fine playhouse for the kids. And it's a favor. I'm saving you. Thanks. Want me to put the money in something safe? You're not touching it. I'd rather give it to you. Bddi, we'll - You're not saving me. No problem. I'm having a party soon. - Oh? I'll put you on the list. -Great. Do you know what's on the menu? -What? Animals in danger of extinction. No! - Eighteen species. Fuck, man. - See you, Bddi. Nice to see you. You're a good listener and always here to support me. Are you chatting to Grettir? Yes, a bit. Well, dear boy. Welcome home. And Merry Christmas. You'll get room 23. Merry Christmas? It's summer. I'm always celebrating Christmas. Or New Years Eve. Is Sigurjn there? Do you have many? The publisher. B?var Steingrmsson. He's still in a meeting. Who is he meeting? Police detectives? Isn't he always solving some fucking crime puzzle? Isn't that what you do? Hello? Why don't you want to marry me? Oh, come on. Why are we fucking then? It's nice to be fucked every now and then. Then I don't feel like I'm a complete cow, you know? I was thinking. I have to go for some tests in the hospital. It could take a few days. Could you take Albert? What tests? - The plumbing. The plumbing? Yes, of course. No problem. - Great. Well, we have to go to sleep, my boy. I want a woman tonight. I want to fuck tonight. Just do the cook. Yes, put lipstick on him and put him in a dress. Let's get dressed and go out. I know. Yes, it's very boring getting dressed. You've done really well. - You think? Yes. I've had some time to think here. Remember what we talked about the other day, about living together? Yes, we can talk about it when you're done here. Of course. Can you call dad for me? They really want to see little Albert. -Of course. No problem. - Thanks. You know about the operation Dagga is having tomorrow. Operation? - Yes. No. - No? Brimar. Nice to see you. And you. Father and son. Bddi, nobody fucks himself into our family. Just so you know. Hold this please. Social Security Number? Why are you testing my blood? It's a paternity thing. - Paternity? Yes, Albert Sturla. Born January 6th. Aren't you the... - Yes, he is my son. The mother has probably requested it. It often happens in such cases. Such cases? Yes, isn't it a one night stand? One night what? It isn't your fucking concern. Well I'm just trying to explain. You might be a bastard but my Grettir is not one. I'm his dad, this is destiny. I don't know what you are talking about. This is ridiculous. I'm the dad. Albert Sturla is my kid. Isn't he? -Yes. Of course. Believe me, I didn't make you take a blood test. We were going for a walk, us boys. The little one is sick. He's not going out today. Really? Yes, he was feverish this morning. -I see. Can I take a look at him? - No. No way. What? This family is completely nuts. I said no way. Hi. Mail? No, this is from the Sheriff. You have to sign. "By request of Sigurlaug Inglfsdttir... You are not the father of the child. On behalf of the Sheriff of Skagafjordur. Hannes Pll." Bddi, I know it is terrible. I never thought you weren't the father. I never thought... I was completely sure you were the dad. And that was the way it should be. You were supposed to be the dad. It's not quite enough to want it. -I know. I just hoped. - Why? Just... I've always respected you a lot. You are so intelligent. But we can still be together, can't we? "You were supposed to be the dad." Fucking cow. Over all the peaks there is stillness. After the wind, the night is still like a pool in the moss. A bird is silent and soon you see your own stillness. So much trash here. Bullseye. - Hello? Bddi? Bring me the goddamn bank manager. I'll shoot his dick off so his cunt falls out. No mercy. Everything's gone to shit. My hotel's bankrupt. I've lost everything. The small guy. The small devil. Keli. You're lucky having a son. I lost my girl. It's terrible to lose your kid. You have to remember what's important. The kids are important. I have to go into rehab. Like every year. Keli, won't you come upstairs? I've got an eye disease. Karma glaucoma. All I see is a lie. Take the gun. I don't need it. I'll just shoot my own shadow. Yes. Fuck you, Dagga. Fuck you for good, you fucking whore. You knew it all along. This isn't blood. This isn't the true fountain of the heart. This is not the flow of love. This is not the brook. Not the stream. Not the river. Not the ocean which colors our life red. This peat-red waste which runs slowly through our veins, that's not human blood. Not the creative lifeblood of the generations, but tobacco and coffee and alcohol. Do we need a crack of the whip in the face? Do we need our land burnt? Our women raped? Our children thrown on bayonets? So that our blood becomes red and hot? So that our blood becomes alive So our blood will be real human blood? Will our blood first become red and hot and living when we lie wounded in the vale of death and it runs down into the ruins of our lost motherland? I'm from the Newspaper. Do you mind? No. Where are you going? - To Reykjavik. Someone has to fight this disease which is killing us all. Disease? Is this some charity event? It's a charity event for life as it could be lived. Weren't you supposed to let me know? Goes off on some mission impossible... There is no one to film here. What do you mean? This is great. It's in the papers. You're famous. Revolution is coming to town. This is the fucking thing. We have to start it from day one. From the beginning. The revolution doesn't wait for anyone. No, OK. Fair enough. Can I just start filming now? You know I have a camera. Can I just start shooting? If you like. You can shoot an epic with us. Isn't that right, Nietzsche? This is a goal. In off the post. You're like Dirty Harry on that horse. Dirty Harry didn't ride a horse. Whatever. Here... Let him do something too. Let him rear up or... I'll just go down here. When you do the turn, trot or run... do whatever is fastest. This is a goal. In off the post. Can't you roll a cigarette while you're on the horse? Like Lucky Luke? This is crazy cool. No. - What? Nietzsche is a non-smoking horse. What? He is smokefree. We need to get a cowboy element into it. OK. Put the hat on. - No. Here. This is real. Not a fucking joke. Every cowboy has a hat. Ronald Reagan and Jesse Jackson. That "I have a dream" guy. You have to work with me. I can't do this alone. Show some spirit. Pretend like you don't see him. Sorry. This is the thing. People have had enough of greed. This is going to make us fucking rich. We'll have to do it again. I need to film you from the front. A Spielberg-moment. Hi there. Are you in town? - We're on our way. But have you taken enough good shots? Yes. - Something we can use? Yes, I've got quite a lot of good stuff. -Good. Very good takes. So we... -I was thinking... Aren't we going to do this live tomorrow? Tomorrow? Let's just go live with the stuff when you come to town. - Live? Live is life, my man. That sounds good. Got a cigarette? Didn't you stop? All revolutionaries smoke. Che and Castro and Lenin and... Joke. Here you are. - Thank you. When I heard you were gone I thought: "That makes complete sense." It must be a great shock. What? - Dagga. Dagga what? That she's dead. It must have been a shock. What? You didn't know? Oh shit. You didn't know. Dagga died the other night. What are you saying? Is Dagga dead? She got some infection. I don't know... I thought all this was because of that, the revolution and... I'm really sorry. Relax. Jesus Christ. There is no need to be sorry. Sorry, man. I mean, she wasn't anything. I wasn't even the fucking dad. You weren't the dad? What? The fucking whore cow, she... Now she's dead. When did you learn this? - Just... a short while ago. Fuck. What will happen to the kid? It's just nice to get rid of this. Who needs kids? They can be a problem. Complicate things... But still, I mean... I'm just so pissed off at her. Women, man... Fucking crazy. We just don't talk the same language. Us and them. Women. They're just like abstract art. I just don't understand it. I don't understand them. Completely nuts. Especially in our town. I don't know if you believe me but I think I understand you better than the rest. It's like... Let's take Lra Maria... - Lra Maria? It was a stupid mistake but I don't care. I just had to convince her. She got pregnant, just by accident but didn't want an abortion. So I said to her: "This is a mutual decision. What am I going to do with another kid? I don't have the money and I don't have the time." Just, a lot to do. Except she didn't get it. She didn't understand until I went over it again and again. Lra Maria? You and her? The postman. The whole package. Relax. Are you fucking crazy? What are you doing? Are you all right in the head? Put the gun down. Come on. I'm your fucking brother. Hello. Viddi... He's not here. Yes. Nietzsche, go home. You can't let people see you with a murderer. Want a ride? - No. Yes, I want a ride. Dagga is dead. - What? Dagga is dead. - What? Want to talk about it or... The lie killed her. We have to go. - Why? I have to go to a doctor. - Doctor? Why? To remove a birthmark. - A birthmark? Why? Just because. It's growing. Shall I drive you somewhere? I'll just go where you are going. I'm his brother. Yes. I'm just going into the hospital. You can just come here. I can't be bothered with this. My girlfriend was coming in for an operation. I'm a bit late. Her name is Lra Maria Nachtweih. Yes, here she is. 5-F. She's on the fifth floor. Where do I find 5-F? It's down the hallway and up the stairs. No. Bddi. What are you doing here? What are you doing? I'm going to save the life of this mole. I don't want you to. No one else is left. - What are you talking about? Everybody is dead. Are you crazy? Just relax a bit. Relax? - Yes. That's what wrong with this society. Everybody is so relaxed. We are numb with apathy. We have to wake up. Now! Lra. - Yes. Put your panties on. We're going. Guns don't solve anything. Thoroddur? Are you there somewhere? We are coming out. No. I'm coming out. I've got three hostages. And a gun. Viddi is dead. Come on, Lra. Come on. Come on. Just take it easy. Obey him. Don't hurt her. You two as well. Get out. Not in front. Out. Go. - Easy. You can go. Doctor. Come on. To the right. Easy. You're not going anywhere. - No, I'm not going anywhere. Hello, B?var. - Don't come any nearer. A peculiar situation is brewing here. A former school teacher. - Poet! Poet? - Yes, I'm a poet. A school teacher and poet has taken a young woman and a doctor hostage. You have a blog, Stormland on which you said you said you were going to start a bloody revolution. Is this the revolution? And what about your brother? Viddi had to go. He was a symbol of everything terrible in this world, this endless consumerism. And what, will these two be your next victims? No. I'm saving a life. - Saving a life? I took a life, now I'm saving one. This society... It is locally anesthetized. You are all so worried about your money. But not that you are spiritually bankrupt. You live in a land the world envied and you have let a few banksters destroy it. You are weasels. Bloody spineless wonders. Spineless and toothless. What are you thinking? Nothing. You aren't thinking at all. Everything is instant. I can't wait. So the revolution is against abortions. Lra. I've got a gun. You would never shoot me. No, but I'm talking to you. - You are not talking to me. You are spewing your shit on TV. Who are you to tell us that we are disgusting? A former youth program teacher. Don't twist this. You knew I was in love with you. Still you fucked Viddi. -Yes, I did. How could you let him touch you? Because I thought he was cool. -Cool? Yes, cool and fun. I don't want his kid though. This kid is the only significant thing Viddi has given the world and you are just going to throw it in the trash like everything else. - What was I supposed to do? This child is the only thing left of my family. You have to let it live. Viddi has five kids with four women. He has five mutant cockroaches. They are not kids, they are monsters. But Viddi has this kid with you. I have this kid with you. I love you. But what about the woman's right to control her body? What are you talking about, you bastard? We're not talking to you. Lra, I love you. Bddi! What do you want to accomplish with this? Come on. You're in danger of extinction. The higher you fly the smaller you look in the eyes of the flightless.
