No fingerprints or DNA traces either. The only thing we did find from their fake credit cards" "that, these two were hackers. And, they were no ordinary hackers. They were the undisputed king of their domain. But, sir... for hacking, you don't need to.. ..even step out of your bed. So, what brought these two to Delhi? One thing's sure. Something big is going to happen in Delhi. They didn't come here to steal loose change from the ATMs. So...it's a cyber-cell case. Why don't you seek their help? Sir, I've been working with them.. ...for the past few days. They couldn't even find their real names. It's along shot, sir. So, what's the option? Sir, I need a hacker that thinks like them.

"In this era, guarantee's the last thing to expect." "Listen carefully.." "Love's made in China." We've been granted permission" "but, where are we going to find a guy.. ..with all these qualities? A year ago, there was a news about a hacker.. ..who stole 10 Rs from hundreds of accounts. And people realized the fraud only after three months. And anyway, no one's going to burn precious petrol" ..to lodge a complaint about 10 Rs theft. What was the name of that hacker? Kung-Fu Chameli! I see. Oh yes, sir.

Where have you been since yesterday? I'm in a big mess. - What happened? Kamayani's been murdered. What? How? Who? Where? - I don't know. All I know is I didn't do it. 100 crores have been stolen. And, I'm being blamed for it all. I really don't know what to do. Where are you now? lam in the bank's building. Mickey, so much happened. And you're telling us now. They hired the entire floor.. .and setup a duplicate bank, right below the same bank. They just changed the name. From Excalibur Bank to Excalibur Securities. Didn't you visit her floor? - I did. Three times. She called me twice, and once I had even gone there to propose her. What? - What? The entire thing was pre-planned. So that when I hack their system. ..l wouldn't know that I'm hacking" "the Excalibur Bank system and stealing 100 crores. Mickey. But, they could've made you do this" ..from anywhere. Io, Chutney. The Excalibur Bank systems couldn't be hacked externally. The plan was simple. Get me inside to do this job. The firewall inside the bank wasn't strong enough. That's why you hacked such a secure site internally. But, didn't you ever notice" "that, you're going on the 8th floor? I looked...l pressed 7th floor. When they can plan such a big charade" ..can't they manipulate the lift system. The boy knows a lot now. What do we do with him? Mickey, that girl Kate... Kamayani.. Or whoever she is. She couldn't have done this alone. Someone was definitely helping her. Try to remember. Her office staff. Her boss. Who was supposed to come that night. 'Madam. Sir's entered the building.' All those employees were fake. 'Sir's entered the building.' Chutney! There was a security guard that night. Pancho? - Yeah. I sent him. low, he'll be a big help to you. - Thanks, Floppy. I just need to find that mastermind. What's the plan? Wait, I'll call you back. Siddhant, I'll be there in 20 minutes. My battery's very low. Siddhant! Yes. Chutney. Do one thing. Check out Kamayani's Excalibur Securities site. And Floppy, I'm forwarding you". ..a number I found on Kamayani's number. Track it down. - Okay. There's nothing here, Mickey. The site's missing, just like the office. If someone created a fake site.. ..then, the domain must be registered to someone. Check it online. Nora. The number on KamayanTs phone". "belongs to some Babloo. The Excalibur" The Excalibur domain's also registered in some Babloo's name. Oh no. Mickey, check your phone. Babloo? He's that guard. He's no guard. He's a software engineer. Why was a software engineer. ..working as a guard in a bank? ls he...the mastermind? Oh no. The location of his phone is close to you. - What? Mickey, get out of there. You can get in a mess. Hello, Mickey! Somebody is following you! So, this was your plan. - I was after them for a year. But these Bhram Gang stole my plan.. ..and ruined my game. - Bhram Gang? Pancho. - Run, Mickey. Catch him. That guy's your lifeline to freedom. Don't let him escape. Mickey, run! Take the next left. Are you sure? Floppy, where now? Take a left. Left. Your left or mine. Left's just left. What are you saying? There's a left up ahead as well. The left that you left behind. Mickey, left. Straight. Just go straight. It's a dead end. - Dead" Yes.. Go straight" I've been going straight. I mean right. Take a right. Right. Right. Mickey, he's getting ahead of you. Run. Tell me. Where now? Where's the link? - What link? The link that you used to transfer 100 crores. That link. You're trapped, just like Kamayani. Don't you have the money? What do I look like to you? Why did you kill Kamayani? I didn't kill her. By the time I arrived at her home.. ..she was already dead. Who killed Kamayani? Must be the Bhram Gang. Bhram Gang. 'Look. Life's like a wheel.' 'To keep it in balance, one has to keep moving.' 'If you stop..' Take me to Begh Sarai. Hello. You've reached the voice-mail of Bombay Bakery. Please leave a message after the beep. Chutney. Floppy. Bombay Bakery is our last clue.

He's the guy. FIOPPY- Did you find anything about the voice-mail? I am on it. Hurry UP- Professor? - We called him. Don't worry, Mickey. The Professor has studied your case. From Kamayani to the theft of 100 crores, everything. Case study. - Whoever sent that girl after you.. ..did an extensive research on you. Chutney. Look, Kamayani. Look. Kamayani looks just like Kung-fu Chameli in-person. But...she loved me. Maybe, just like you fell for her, she fell for someone else. But...who could that be? Right now...we've to think of a way to save you. Okay. That girl's dead and these mysterious people are still after you It means that, they still don't have the money.

But, you chose the wrong guy. Io, I chose the right guy. low, all the evidence is against you. So, better tell me where are the 100 crores. Because, only I can help you. You want the money. Come see me below Moolchand Bridge in an hour. Are you out of your mind? Will you.. - One hour, Siddhant! One hour. Otherwise, I'll disappear in thin air with your 100 crores. You can keep looking. Your time starts now. But, you don't have the 100 crores! I know that, but he doesn't. Great idea, Mickey. Let's corner him at Moolchand Bridge.

Meet me at Nehru Place Parking Lot in 20 minutes. Why are you trying to fight a war you can't win? Just do as I say. Floppy. I've found the 100 crores. But, why are you changing the plan? Meet me at Nehru Place Parking Lot in 20 minutes But, why are you changing the plan? I'll tell you later. And, why isn't Chutney answering her phone? Wait, I'll find out. You? That's him. Got you Mickey the Virus! Game over! What a disgraceful place. I wonder why that fool Mickey chose this place. He said he'll tell us once he's here. But, where is he? Where is he? - Must be on the way. Professor, please try to relax. Come on, I mean" What can I say? ls that Mickey? Take a look. Take a look. Mickey. You bas"" why did you kill him? Stop abusing. You should thank me instead. I just saved your life. Otherwise, he would've killed you. 'Don't ever do that again.' Bhram Gang belongs to Floppy, Professor and Pancho. They're the original mastermind of this story. They killed those Hackers and Kamayani. You killed Kamayani. You killed Kamayani. Why? Mickeymwe didn't want to kill her. She's Mickey's girlfriend. Listen! Please tell us where the money is. Listen! We don't have a problem with you. We'll leave. Just tell us where the money is. Why don't you tell us? But.. - Let's go. Come on. You killed Kamayani for money. It was a grave mistake. You knew they're the Bhram Gang. Then, why didn't you catch them? At least Kamayani could have been saved! You'll ask and I'll tell you everything. So that you can capture our conversation" ..on the parking let's CCTV cameras. What do I look like? I've out the CCTV wires. Where's the money, Mickey. You want the money, don't you? Bhram Gang's Mastermind. You want the money as well, don't you? Come out. Mickeymgive me the link to the money. Professor. You've brought the entire Bhram Gang along. Snatch it. Professor, don't come any closer. Otherwise, I will press this button.. ..and the money will be transferred" ..back into Anwar Raja's account. There were two teams in this game. Team Bhram Gang, led by Professor. Floppy and Pancho. But, Siddhant. When did you enter this game with your team? When two hackers were killed... A thought crossed my mind. Hacking means money. There's a saying amongst us. Only be honest till a limit. During the hacker investigation I came across Babloo. Corrupt power broker Anwar Raja's got an account in the bank.. ..where he's stashed billions in black money. The small time software engineer Babloo couldn't hack the account" ..he even tried to take Bhram Gang's help online. But these guys hacked his email instead" ..and stole all his information. And, when Bhram Gang couldn't" "hack Anwar Raja's account either" "they called hackers from overseas. But, why call them this far? Come on, Mickey. Don't be such a bad student. We called them to India because" ..tomorrow if the news of the theft breaks out.. "these corrupt politicians In India won't let it leak out, After those hackers failed.. "sending them back was not an option for Bhram Gang. You didn't have an alternative so you killed them. You could've employed the Bhram Gang for this job. Then, why me? They were outsourcing hackers from outside" "so, they couldn't have helped me. And, by hacking their secure site under a minute" "you proved, that I bet on the right horse. I just had to do a little research on you. Because your rules are different. 'I don't work 'for' or with' anyone. That's my rule.' 'What's that, sir?' So I felt...I'll have to do something about your childish heart. And you sent Kamayani. Right move at the right moment. 'I don't want to get stuck in these legal procedures.' 'Sir, please.' 'I'm ready to do anything you want.' You used Kamayani.. "and, made Babloo stall her, to keep an eye. It was necessary. The virus called love is a bad one. And used this pressure against you. First time, you were in a hurry.. ..to throw your girlfriend an anniversary party. And the second time, you were under pressure to save herjob. 'I messed up everything. - Kamayani, just give me the link.' You used that police mind in the right away, ACP. And we bookworms were trying to hack it from outside. But, you trapped him and took him inside the bank. ..where it was comparatively easier.. ..to break the bank's firewalls. And, at the right moment you pressurized me.. ..and I hacked the bank's secure site. That's the problem with this generation. They don't perform until you don't apply pressure. And you pressurized me again.. "after Kamayani died. Knowing that...l wasn't involved in Kamayani's murder. After Kamayani's death my plan was foiled. I didn't know where the money was" ..nor did the Bhram Gang members. All they knew...that you can track this money. And I thought...to salvage the situation" ..l need to find those 100 crores. I've worked really hard for those 100 crores. I won't let go of it. Don't give him the money, he'll kill you. Shall I give it to you, Professor? Will you let me go? You're the bigger fraud here. - Yes, I am. I had to be. What could I do? What's the value of a Harvard genius in this country? Nothing. It still takes minutes to download a video. Politicians like Anwar Raja.. ..have stashed away millions and billions. ls it fair? ls it? Does that mean we steal it? It's not wrong to steal from a thief. They stole it from the people. The Professor shouldn't get his hands on this money. Mickey, tell me where's the money. Otherwise I will kill you. If you give him the money, I won't spare you. Mickey, what's wrong? You slimy virusl! He's been recording our conversation" ..from behind that wallpaper. What now, Virus? Your tin-can's broken. Are you going to come out afterl die? Come out! Bhalla's here. Bhalla. Arrest him.. - Sir. I tried explaining you". ..but you could never understand this virus. Sorry, Mickey. I've been trying to come out for long. But, so many bullets were fired here.. ...I'm allergic to gun-powder. I start sneezing. Really. Don't mind. Sir. This Virus had already" "arranged for an anti-virus. This program's being telecasted live on Youtube. I'm sure you must have got half a dozen hits by now. So, basically...you're sc""". In Hindi, you're in a mess. Sir, I went to arrest him. At the girl's house. So, you aren't involved in this game. I'll give you a punch on your face. How dare you doubt me! I received a call from this girl. She wanted to tell me some secret. Then, she never called back. So, I also didn't take an interest. By the way, what are you up to? Hello. Bhalla. You want to know the game, right. He said to me. Give me one hour.. - I'll expose everything. But, this is like the scoop of the year! You know, Professor. We slow-pokes are better than" ..an internet virus like you. What was the point of your education" ..if you wanted to be a thief in the end? Remember, even Raavan lost his pride. My son's a big fan of yours. He always says "A real police officer.." "..should be like your ACP, not you". He doesn't want to be like me. And, I won't let him become like you. Would you prefer to sit up front or the back? Mickey. Floppy, Panchomthey are" Mr. Bhalla. Details of the 99 crores. The root of this entire problem. See you. What is this 99, a lucky number? I mean, sir could've stolen 100 crores. Why steal 99? - I thought about it to, but.. then the bell rung? Phone's ringing. One minute. Hello. Yes, mom. Yes, mom. I kept lying to you. lam telling you the truth for the first time I was stuck in a big mess. But, I am out now. Yes. - Fine. Bring gourd when you come home. I'll make sweetmeat for you. I just got out of a big mess.. ..and all you can think about are gourds. Fine. I'll get you 5 kilos extra. You can make sweet gourd for the entire colony. By the way, Mr. Bhalla how does it make a difference. W or BM! And, like you say" When a big vegetable is cut... everyone gets a piece of it.. "Oh Mickey Virus! Digital freak!" Saurabh Varma Who do you think you are? You want me to act. I won't do it. You can do anything you want. What do you see when you buy a computer? Forget it, Mr. Bhalla. There are lot of technicalities. Like the graphic card, what's the ram, how many GB's.. Forget it. I just bought a computer for my son. I see. Which one? - The black one. He was saying silver. But my wife didn't agree. The sofa in our room is brown. So are the walls. So she said black will match the colors. What's this? Mickey. - Yes. Will you do a job for me? - Will I have to move for it? Yes. - Then ask someone else. Come on, lazybones. You can't do a simple thing. Just drive the scooter. Don't get so close. Why don't you buy a proper helmet? Why buy just half? Did you sell the other half for a cup of tea? I'm going flat broke because of you. My life's ruined. Listen. There's a petrol pump up ahead. Fill up 10 Rs of petrol. My wife's a hacker too. I'm always missing money from my purse every other day. The time your wife takes to steal money.. "hackers can hack someone's account" ..big secrets, sexual fantasies" ..and sc"" someone's entire life. Sir. How can someone's sexual fantasies get stolen? He said give me an hour, I'll expose everything. But, this is like complete disclosure. Who's going to say what happened to Anwar Raja? Siddhant. Someone tell me.
