Sweetie, the nice lady asked you a question. Oh, Iast night he wouId hardIy stop taIking about it. He kept insisting that one of those dinosaur things - was hiding in the cIoset. - Oh, dinosaurs, huh?

For the money we're paying, l half expected John TravoIta to waIk out. - ( laughter ) - FueI isn't cheap. We're already getting a discount through the flight schooI, so stop! Yeah, come on-- Iive a IittIe. So how much you think one of these IittIe puddIe jumpers costs anyways?

So where'd Sara find the stiff? He found her. What do you mean he found her? He just kinda showed up one day. She was Iooking for a study partner. Smart guy. Wait a second-- she's pIaying hide the sausage with her tutor? I guess a big brain can be a turn on. - Not that I speak from experience. - Big brain? He's a trust-fund prick. Come on. - Beer? - No. Trust fund? What do you mean? His parents rich or something? Or something. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You sure? You don't Iook so good. ( giggIes ) Yeah. Yeah, I am sure.

Hey, this is our Iast weekend together. Do you reaIIy want to spend it arguing about SaI? - Don't say that. - Don't say what? Last weekend. You make it sound like we're never going to see each other again. Hey, MontreaI's a Iong way from here. This is a big deaI for me. You don't think it's a big deaI for me too?

What are those for? - Motion sickness. - Oh, motion sickness, yeah. Try not to yak on me on this flight, okay, sweetcheeks? Thanks for being so supportive. At Ieast it's onIy Iike an hour-and-a-haIf flight. The drive up there was brutaI. Remember it? But we might get a decent camping spot this year, which wouId be amazing. I don't know. I heard there's supposed to be twice as many peopIe this year. How about you just reIax? There's going to be pIenty of room. - That's what you said Iast year. - So? So we ended up sIeeping in a ditch! That's funny because I don't remember being in a ditch. l'm surprised you remembered your name after aII that tequiIa. Oh yeah. Radio: Gulfwing to Foxtrot, you're puIIing Pantheon 442 in a seven miIe finaI wind, How many times have you done this? You mean soIo'd? Yeah, no instructor, no copiIot, just you. PIenty.

I don't recommend it. Do you? ( groans ) Yankee ZuIu X-ray, Harrisford VOR. Out of 2,200 for 5,500 enroute to Green Lake. Tower: Yankee Zulu X-ray, squad 5247 and ident, cIeared 5,500. Yankee ZuIu X-ray, squad 5247, cIeared 5,500. Tower: Yankee ZuIu X-ray, you're radar identified. GreenIight aItimeter is two niner eight niner. Yankee ZuIu X-ray, roger. - What's happening? - I just toId them who we are and what we want to do and they assigned us a new transponder code so that radar can identify us. lt's all routine. There's nothing to worry about. So, Sara, what's with you taking the train to McGiII? It was my dad's idea. He thought I couId see more of the country that way. You stiII need a ride at the asscrack of dawn? No, it's okay. I've got it covered. Um, actuaIIy my dad reaIIy wanted to see me off, so I toId him he couId drive. Whatever. Just Iet me know. Yeah, but I thought that-- never mind. Someone take this. Take it. Oh great. This thing aIways goes out of tune. - Mel: Tune it up. - What are you doing? - Filming you. - I can see that. AII right. So you gonna shoot that video for my band or what? That depends. Do I stiII get finaI cut? You can have whatever you want as long as it got hos in it. CIassy, I Iike it. Speaking of hos, how's the Iove Iife? Ooh, getting a IittIe personaI, don't you think? Come on, you can teII me. Anybody special? - There might be. - It's a dude. Oh yeah? Anybody we know? Um, I better not say. - Why not? - She's got a boyfriend. Funny guy. ( strumming guitar ) Shouldn't you keep your hands on the wheeI? It's okay, that's what the rudder pedaIs are for. ( VeIcro rips ) - You forget something? - No. I'm just making sure my gift's not getting crushed. You brought it? Of course. - What gift? - Just a IittIe something. Oh yeah? What'd you get him, a personality or something? - Show us! - No, it's just a comic book. Sara: The guy at the store said it was pretty rare and I figured since Bruce was a coIIector... A comic book. - You're one of those guys. - What is that supposed to mean? Dude, nothing, buddy. Come on, Iet me see it. - Yeah, come on. - Cory: Come on, Iet me see it. He can't right now because he's flying the pIane. - Whoa. What? - Mel: Sara. Sara, can you please stop screwing around with this guy? - Sara: Our Iives are in his hands. - Just relax, okay? She knows what she's doing. Sara: You're doing fine. See? It's not that hard. - ( pIane rattIes ) - Whoa! ( panting ) Shit! Shit! l think we get the point now. Can you take back the controIs, pIease? No, it's all right. It's just a IittIe bit of turbuIence. - Just puII back sIowly. - l can't. - Just puII back sIowly. - No, I can't. ( rattIing ) - Sara, this isn't funny anymore. - Come on, pull back. Cory: l think we'd all be more comfortabIe with Sara flying the pIane. - No offense, man. - Sara, come on now. Jesus, Sara. God. That was fun. Next time I want to be in front. Are you aII right? - Fuck this shit. Give me this. - Hey! - Sara: SaI, come on. - What are you gonna do, punk, huh? Oh, I'm sorry. Is this yours? Ooh, 'Weird Stories." - Ooh, creepy. - Hey, dude, do you mind? - Guys, give it back. - You want it? - Be carefuI with it. - Easy, guys. Be carefuI. Be carefuI, it's a comic book. MeI: SaI, just give it back. My God, l'm taking it out of its protective case thing. Oh. Oh my God. Great condition. SaI, you're so not funny. Stop it. - It's ripping. - Come on. Mel: SaI, what are you doing? I'm sorry. Oh my God, this looks pretty important to the story. - SeriousIy? - Oh. What, are you seven years oId reading comics? You know, the next time you try and get us kiIIed - I'm wiping my whoIe ass with it. - Okay, SaI, that's enough. Okay? Just give it back to him. - LittIe kid stiII reading comics. - Give it back to him. Yeah, you want your comic? You want your comic? - Take your fucking comic. - Come on, SaI. God. It's okay. What's that? It's a bus ticket to MontreaI. MontreaI? Isn't that where you're moving, Sara? Sorry, man. I was gonna teII you. When exactly were you gonna teII me? I don't know. We'II taIk about this Iater. - Center, Yankee ZuIu X-ray. - Yankee ZuIu X-ray. Yankee ZuIu X-ray requesting Yankee ZuIu X-ray, you're cIeared to 1 0,500, negative traffic. Hey. What's going on? Um, we've got weather ahead and I'm not instrument rated - so we'II have to cIimb above it. - Whoa whoa whoa. What does not instrument rated mean? It means I have to visuaIIy maintain separation from the ground at aII times. TransIation: it means she can't fly through cIouds. Clouds? Are you kidding me? ( groans ) WiII you shut up? How high does this thing go anyway? Surface ceiIing is 24,000. Look at it this way-- commerciaI airlines fly at 40. ( rattIing ) Sorry about that, guys. It's just a IittIe bit of unsettIed air. - Unsettled air? - It's the third time. Aren't we supposed to IeveI off or something? - I'm trying. - What do you mean you're trying? It means I'm trying. - Quit screwing around, Sara. - This isn't a joke. The eIevator's not responding for some reason. - There's an eIevator on this pIane? - Not that kind of eIevator. You see that part on the tail that's sticking up at an angIe? - Which part? - The hinged sextion. - Yeah. - Okay, when air goes over it the taiI goes down, making us go up. l don't know, something's jammed it. - You've got to be kidding me. - Come on. - What do we do? - SaI: MeI, put the camera away! For 10 minutes! Center, Yankee Zulu X-ray. I think I have a probIem here. Yankee Zulu X-ray, Center. Are you decIaring an emergency? Yankee ZuIu X-ray, uh... not at this time. Not at this time? I thought you said we couIdn't IeveI off. No, there are procedures for this. l'll just reduce power. You shouId probabIy teII them that then, Sara. Hey, who's the piIot here? Everyone just reIax, okay? ( thunder rumbIing ) Oh no. Oh shit. Coz, we shouId turn around. Turn this thing around. Sara, we need to go back. - Let's turn around now. - Yeah. What the heII? ( thunder rumbIing ) This is bad. I'm sure this is bad. Sara: Everybody just stay caIm, okay? That's impossibIe. Cory: 20,000 feet? Is that right? It can't be. There must be some kind of gIitch. Center, Yankee ZuIu X-ray. My elevator is jammed and my instruments are maIfunctioning. I am cIimbing and have Iost position in cloud. Please advise. ( static ) - Center, Yankee ZuIu X-ray. - Hey, what the heII is going on? I can't raise anybody. What do you mean you can't raise anybody? Mayday mayday mayday. Yankee Zulu X-ray. ApproximateIy 15 miIes east of Patterson VOR, aItitude unknown, instrument faiIure. - PIease respond. - ( static ) Mayday mayday mayday. Yankee Zulu X-ray. ( radio screeching ) Sara? No one's answering. There's nothing. - Just dead air. - Jesus Christ. - So what do we do? - l don't know. You don't know? You're the pilot. Get us out of this! Okay, what about the procedures? You said you wanted to reduce power. I can't risk it now. VisibiIity is zero. And without instruments we couId fly straight into a mountain. Hey, what did you do? Huh? You Iet him fly the pIane. He probabIy fucked something up. - He didn't do anything. - Yeah weII, somebody did. Sal: Yeah yeah yeah, he's right. You know what? This is your fauIt, Sara. Sara: This is not my fauIt. How Iong have you had your license anyway? Sara: Long enough. You onIy checked out on one of these things, what, Iike a week ago? Jesus Christ, I can't beIieve l was stupid enough-- SaI, wiII you just caIm down? You're not helping. Maybe I missed something during the preflight, l don't know. - Cory: Maybe you missed something? - SaI: Oh, there you go. Sara: We need to contact traffic controI. If they stiII have a radar fix on us they can talk us down. Um, ceII phones. Does anyone have a signaI? - ( beeps ) - No. Wait wait wait. ( beeps ) - Fuck, I got nothing. - Same here. Think. Shit, something's wrong. We're staIIing. I have to go to maximum power. Bruce? Bruce, God damn it! There's a piIot operating handbook underneath the seat. - Can you give it to me, please? - You want to check the manuaI? I thought you knew how to fly this thing. Just give it to me, pIease. Give it to me! Go to section 5. - Now what? - The maximum takeoff weight. It shouId say somewhere. Uh, 6,500. Okay, if we're over that the staII speed wiII change. What's the basic empty weight? - 4891 . - SaI, how much do you weigh? - What? - How much? - Uh, 170, why? - MeI? - 1 10. - 155. Bruce? Bruce, pIease. Um, 150. Okay, I'm 1 10 pIus 100 for baggage. - 1 800. - 1800? I think we're too heavy. We shouId get rid of anything we don't need. - Are you kidding me? - Do I Iook Iike I'm kidding? Sara, I'm not throwing my stuff out of the pIane. You know what? I'II do it for you, okay? - SaI, no. No! - Sit down. I'm gonna open the hatch. - Be carefuI, pIease. - You know l will. - You guys ready? - Yeah, l got it. - AII right, anchor me. - I got you, I got you. Got me? AII right, I'm opening. - Be carefuI back there. - All right, l got you. One, two, three. ( air rushing ) - I got you, I got you. - I'm good. I'm good. You got it ready? - Can't keep this thing in tune anyway. - And you pIay Iike shit. Okay, what's next? Go! - You got it? - Next. - Next. - Here. Get your bag, I'II get the other one. - ( roars ) - What the fuck? Mel: What is it? What's going on? - Cory: SaI, what's wrong with you? - I just saw something. - What? - I don't know! I don't know! - SaI man, I need you. - I know. Okay. Uh, I think that's it. You're next, go. - What, are you hoIding out on us? - Look man, that stays, all right? AII right, weII, I'm keeping something too, huh? - Whoo! - That's it, come on. ( grunting ) - A IittIe heIp. - ( grunts ) ( panting ) Is it better? Maybe. I don't know. This doesn't make sense. The systems aren't supposed to faiI Iike this. So how Iong do we have? Sara? Sara, how Iong do we have? We'II be out of fueI in Iess than an hour. ( thunder rumbIing ) What are you saying? When we took off the tanks were only half full. No. We're gonna draw straws and the winner gets the parachute. - Oh, come on. - Cory: It's a good idea. - What? - He's right. l can't believe you're even taIking about this. - No, guys, it's too dangerous. - Too dangerous? Is that a joke? We don't know who put that chute here. We don't even know if it's packed properly. - None of us have even skydived before. - How hard can it be? Look, we couId be at 10,000 feet. We could be at 1 ,000. You jump when we're too Iow you're gonna hit the ground before your chute opens. If it even opens. Are you crazy? Too Iow? We've been going up the whoIe time. Have we? The first thing that they teach you at flight schooI is just how disoriented you get when you can't see the ground. There's no way that we're putting that on. There's no way. You know what? Screw this. MeI, take it. - What are you doing? - You're putting it on. - What are you doing, man? - I'm saving her Iife, man. Take it. Hey, back off, Cory. I'm not gonna Iet you die Iike this. Look, man, I said back off. We're drawing straws like l said before. She's your girlfriend, man. You gonna Iet her die? Yeah, she's my girlfriend. - I'm gonna decide. - Decide what? God, you're a fucking asshoIe. You know that? Oh yeah? I'm the asshoIe here, right? MeI: Stop it! Quit it! - You want some? - Sara: What the heII is going on? - MeI, MeI, stop them. - Stop it! Both of you stop it! That the best you got, man? That's what they teach you in schooI? Just fuck off, man. Fuck off. No wonder you lost every wrestIing match. Fuck you. I didn't Iose every match. ( camera beeping ) Shit. Sal: Un-fucking-beIievabIe. Un-fucking-beIievabIe. Give me that. - Stop! No! - Give me it, MeI. Gimme. - Leave her aIone! - Stop it! Everybody stop it! Do you want to get out of this aIive? Do you? Do you want to get out of this aIive? WeII, then I'm the piIot and what I say goes. Is that acceptabIe to you? Is that acceptabIe, yes or no? Is that acceptabIe? Good. Now everyone just stay in your seats and shut up. Bruce: We're gonna die Iike them. We're gonna die Iike them. What do you mean? We're gonna die Iike them. We have to get down. Bruce, we're aII scared, okay? Just take it easy. No no, we have to Iand the pIane. We have to get the pIane down. Dude, just reIax. No, Iook, we have to get me down. We have to get me down now. - We have to get down! - Somebody help! - Sal, someone, stop him! - Get me down! Get me down! Got to get down now! No! No! No! I'm not gonna die Iike them! I'm not gonna die Iike them! - I am not gonna die Iike them! - ReIax! ReIax, aII right? Just relax. There we go. There we go. Just reIax. SaI, what are you doing? There we go. There we go. There it is. Put him down. MeI: Who's flying the pIane? Autopilot. Is he breathing? Yeah, he'll be fine. I just put him to sIeep. What was aII that shit he said about people dying? He must have meant his parents. They died in a car accident. - Are you sure? - If he's so afraid of flying, - why'd he come? - Because I invited him. You know what? That's right, I forgot. He's a freak and he's in love. We're not in Iove. Yeah? Does he know that? What are you gonna do, huh? You gonna have one Iast weekend of pity sex with him and just trash him Iike a Ieaky rubber, huh? Is that what you were gonna do? That's cold. That's coId, sweetie. You don't know a thing about me or what l want. Yeah, whatever. - We'd better tie him up. - Tie him up? Isn't that a bit extreme? You want him to go aII kamikaze on us again, huh? You got a bIade, man? AII right. - ( groans ) - Sara. It's getting reaIIy coId in here, Sara. I'm sorry. This cabin isn't pressurized. - Isn't there a heater? - Yeah there is, but we can't use it. Why? Because it runs on the main fueI suppIy and we need every Iast drop for the engines. Oxygen is the reaI probIem. What do you mean? Above 13,000 feet we're gonna start suffering from hypoxia. Hypoxia? What's hypoxia? lt's oxygen deprivation-- shortness of breath, headaches, nausea. I thought you said this thing could go to 24,000 feet. It can, but most peopIe don't bring it above 10. That's why there's no breathing gear. Damn it. If my eIevator worked I couId do a controIIed descent and we couId aII get our bearings. Is there a way that we can cIear the jam? I mean, Iike an access paneI? There's nothing we can do from here. Somebody wouId have to go outside and do it manuaIIy. What do you mean, go outside? On the tail? No no no, that-- screw that. We're not doing that. That's ridicuIous. That's your attitude for everything, isn't it? - Just give up. - What, do you want to go out there? Huh? Be my guest. ( rattIing ) Oh no. SaI: What now? The deicing boots are maIfunctioning. The what? They keep ice from buiIding up on the wings. Aren't you supposed to check aII this shit before we take off? I didn't know we were gonna be flying this high, did I? So ice buiIds up, what does that mean? lt means we don't generate enough Iift. And if it bIocks the aiIerons then we're reaIIy screwed. Oh, perfect. ( panting ) MeI, what's wrong? Are you okay? Just a headache. What are you doing? You heard her. We just ran out of options. Cory, you're not going out there. Beats sitting in here waiting to die. Sara: No no no, Cory. You can't go out there. There's nothing to hang onto. You'll be blown right off. - That's what the rope's for. - Listen to her, okay? She knows what she's taIking about. - Look, take this with you at Ieast. - The parachute? Look, I've been free cIimbing since l was 1 2, okay? - It'II onIy sIow me down. - My hero. Dude, you want to go out there? Huh? Feel free. Be my guest. - It might not even work. - What? Look, wiII it or won't it? Sara, you're the expert here. WiII this work or won't it? Enough pressure on the eIevator wiII be abIe to free it. - So yeah. - Okay. - AII right, can you sIow us down? - I'II try. - HeIp me, heIp me. - There's got to be another option. - No, there isn't. - There's no other way, you heard her. See that rope back there? Get it and tie it to something. - Make sure it's tight. - Yeah yeah, okay okay. I got it. I got it. Piece of cake. Who the heII taught you how to tie a knot? - What is that? - It's a knot. Like this. - You sure you're ready for this, man? - What's that supposed to mean? - It means you've been drinking, fucko. - Oh my God, come on. - Not now. - I just need to know I can trust you. Give me this. Is this enough for you, huh? - You satisfied now? - Okay okay okay okay. - I can fucking do this, aII right? - Okay, Iet's do it. Okay, I'm reducing power. - Okay. - Cory, come here. Yeah yeah? What? - Come back. - Okay. No, promise me you'II come back. I promise. It's okay. I've done this 100 times. Just not quite this high. lt's fine. Fly, okay? lt's okay. It's aII right. Keep me in focus, okay? All right? Okay. It's fine. Okay, Iet's do it. Come on. ( exhaIes ) Okay. ( breathing heaviIy ) Rock and roII. What's wrong? My weight distribution's off. We're not balanced. - Cory! - Jesus Christ, Sara, come on! Uh... ( grunting ) Oh my God. Sara! Come on. Okay. Oh, that's better. How's he doing? He's good, he's good. He's all right. - You're aII right, right, buddy? - It's too far. - I think I've got to jump. - What? Are you crazy? - No! - ( screams ) Jesus. - There he is. There he is. - Come on, Cory. There we go. There we go. He's on the taiI! He's on the taiI. Come on, man. Come on. ( thumps ) Come on. Come on, Cory. Come on. ( engine revs ) ( laughs ) I've got controI back. You did it, bro! Ha ha! ( roaring ) Damn it, MeI, put that thing away. Come heIp me. Come on. - Okay. - How's he doing back there? He's not gonna make it. He's freezing. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Come on, Cory! For Christ's sake, Sara, keep it steady. I'm trying. Come on, Cory, right here. On the count of three you're gonna take my hand, all right? AII right, ready? One... two... three! No! Jesus! Fuck! Hold on! Oh shit. Shit! Oh my God! ( grunts ) ( groaning ) ( groans ) Do you have him? SaI, what's happening? Oh shit. ( thunder rumbIes ) ( panting ) Somebody taIk to me. SaI? ( sighs ) He's gone. What? He's gone. No. No. The fucking rope broke. He's gone. No. No no. I saw something. ( sobbing ) No. No no. - I thought I saw it before, now I know. - No. Could you just shut up and Iisten to me a second? Just shut up and Iisten to me for a second, okay? It got him. I saw it. It was huge. It was fucking huge. It was bIack. You didn't see it? You didn't hear it? Aren't you listening to me? It fucking grabbed him. I saw it! What does it matter? Cory's dead. Yeah weII, better him than us. Sara: No. Just get us down now. Right now. - No. - Just Iand this pIane now. - Just get it down now! - I wiII! Right now. Right now. Can anybody see anything? More goddamn cIouds. What happened? Where are we? Why the heII am I tied up? It's for your own good. We're not cIimbing anymore. That's right. We're gonna be okay now. We are? Where's Cory? Sara? You kiIIed him. He trusted you. And you kiIIed him. l don't know what you're taIking about, MeI. This didn't break. It was cut. Are you Iistening to yourseIf right now? Huh? Listen to yourseIf right now. You sound fucking crazy. He saved our Iives. Where were you when I needed heIp pulling him in, huh? - Where were you? - I was there. - Oh, I must have bIinked. - I hit my head. I'm sure you did. But you know what? None of that matters now. - Your boyfriend is gone. - What? You heard me. Mel, it was an accident. Okay? You know it was. You're fucking crazy. l'm the crazy one? You just accused me of kiIIing someone. Guys, stop! WouId someone pIease teII me what happened to Cory? He went outside on the taiI to fix the elevator. SaI thinks something grabbed him. Look, l know what l saw. Okay? I know what I saw! It was reaI. What was? What was reaI? - We don't know. - BuIIshit. BuIIshit. BuIIshit. There's a monster out there and it's stiII out there. SaI, just shut up, okay? Just shut up. How Iong are you gonna keep me tied up for? TiII we know we can trust you. Of course you can trust me. Can I reaIIy? You compIeteIy Iost it earlier and you Iied to me. About what? Your parents weren't kiIIed in a car crash, were they? Were they? No. MeI, can you come up here, pIease? Keep an eye out. For what? Anything. You know how I said we were gonna have that taIk Iater? Look at me. We're having it now. I knew your mother. What? I knew your mother. What are you taIking about? I was there when it happened. When what happened? I was one of the passengers. ( screaming ) When they puIIed me out of that Iake haIf my bones were broken. And I spent six months in the hospitaI just trying to waIk again. So you're saying you're the TayIors' kid? l thought you said your Iast name was Parker. The Parkers are my foster parents. ( sniffles ) So you knew who I was when we first met. I didn't want it to affect things between us. - I knew you wouId freak out. - Jesus, man. Freak her out? God, you are some fucking death magnet. Jesus, we're so fucked. We're so fucked! Aaah! Fuck! What did you think wouId happen when I went off to McGiII? You think I'd fly home every other weekend to see you? Our Iives are going in different directions. You're so different than I thought you were. You're a Iiar. You make up this story Iike you know my mom. That's a sick buIIshit fantasy. You had to know that this couIdn't Iast. You had to know that. TeII me you knew that. A fantasy? A fantasy?! Your mom kiIIed my parents. My Iife is so screwed up. Your mom destroyed my Iife. You don't know shit. I figured it out though. Figured what out, Bruce? - We're meant to be together, Sara. - Meant to be together? - Are you crazy? - I Iove you. What did you just say? I Iove you. Don't say that. Mayday mayday mayday. Yankee ZuIu X-ray. Position and aItitude unknown. Can anybody read me? Can someone pIease untie these ropes? Sure, I'II get right to it. Sara: Mayday mayday, Yankee ZuIu X-ray. ( squeaIing ) MeI: What is it? I don't know. Let us hear it. ( squeaIing ) It's that thing. lt's that thing. It's back. It's back. No, it's distortion. lt has to be. - Oh come on. - No, that's not distortion. Sara: Whatever it is, there's a rationaI expIanation. Yeah? WeII, good. 'Cause I think we'd aII Iike to hear it, Sara. What do you want me to say? Hypoxia makes you see things or hear things. Not the same things. Look, the aItimeter says we should be in outer space. How do you expIain that right now? - Some magnetic interference. - Sara, you heard it. - lt's not normal. - Yeah, I heard something. It couId be crosstaIk or interference with sunspots-- - something. - Oh my God, sunspots? Are you kidding me? You're not a radio expert, SaI. None of us are. Sal: AII right, Iet's just be reaI. I think there's something we aII need to admit right now, don't you think? Admit what? Come on, Sara, we've been going down for what, like 20 minutes? Come on, teII me you're not thinking the same thing l am. Spit it out. Where the heII is the ground? ( panting ) Sara. Sara, your dad, he works on secret projects, right? - Yeah, no-- - Like for the air force. - Yeah. - Yeah, good point. Remember the mechanic we saw? You know, the cameI jockey. WeII maybe, just maybe, he rigged the pIane to kiII the coIoneI's daughter. - How's that? - That's not what I meant. Okay, what if we don't need to come down? What if we never took off? MeI. Look, just hear me out, okay? What if we're just part of some big experiment? You know, Iike something to see how peopIe react to stress. - MeI, that's impossibIe. - Why? Because he doesn't even know we're here. - What? - What the fuck? He thinks we're driving to the concert. He doesn't even know I have my piIot's Iicense. Are you shitting me, Sara? He's paranoid. He's convinced I'II end up the same way my mom did. Well, Jesus, l wonder what gave him that idea. Look, it has nothing to do with that, okay? The point is is it's not some giant government conspiracy. Why not? Because things Iike that don't happen in reaI Iife. There wasn't any information reIeased on the pIane that hit us. What pIane? The one that killed her mom and my parents. Didn't you hear the rumors? There's no record of it. - lt just appeared out of nowhere. - The ghost pIane theory? ReaIIy? It's just Iike we're trapped in a hanger. We're plugged into some sort of simuIation. - Or maybe it's drugs. - Drugs? Like those LSD tests they did back in the '60s. Yeah well, one hell of a bad trip we're having. WeII, it makes more sense than anything else. WeII, shit. I say we find out. - Sara: What? - I don't know, jump. I mean, in dreams, l don't know, you're faIIing and you wake up. Maybe it's the same in this situation, huh? Maybe it's the same. You know what? I think you're on to something, SaI. Why don't you go ahead and give it a shot? Maybe it's just the booze taIking, I don't know. I don't know. But right now-- right now it's saying shut the fuck up and drink me. So you know what? - I'm gonna do just that. - ( can pops open ) Cheers. ( gasps ) ( woman Iaughing ) ( birds chirping ) Wake up, Sara. Sara. Wake up, Sara. Sara, wake up. Sara. Sara. Sara, wake up. Sara! Sara, wake up! Something hit us. We need you to fly the pIane. Sara! ( thunder rumbIing ) Sara! Sara! Come on, wake up. Jesus. ( air rushing ) Sara, come on! Sara! ( high-pitched whine ) ( sobbing ) I can't take this. - I can't take this anymore. - Mel. No no no, MeI, just stay with me. - I can't. - Stay with me, MeI. It's gonna be okay. I promise. - Okay? - I can't. It's gonna be okay. ( sobbing ) ( roaring ) ( shrieking ) - What's happening? - Oh no. ( roars ) ( screams ) SaI: What? lt's got us. - What is it? - Shake it off! Am I the onIy one that's gone compIeteIy insane or did anybody else just haIIucinate something attacking us? - CaIm down, SaI. - Calm down? That thing is gonna rip us apart, Sara. Whatever it is, it's gone, okay? Just reIax. You wouId say that 'cause you put us in this situation. Sara: This isn't about me, okay? This isn't my fauIt. - Bruce, what are you doing? - ( Bruce muttering ) Bruce, stop it. I'm serious. MeI: SaI. SaI, I think I-- - I think I took too many. - MeI. - I think I took too many. - MeI. MeI! MeI, Jesus Christ. MeI, come on. No no. Don't do this. Come on, come on. Hey hey, baby. Baby. Baby. Guys, something's wrong with MeI. - What happened to her? - I don't know. I can't feeI a puIse. - Fuck, man, I think she OD'd. - OD'd on what? On her fucking pills! What do you think she OD'd on? MeI! No, baby MeI. No no no no. - We've got to get her breathing. - Mel, come on! PIease pIease heIp her. Please. - What the fuck are you doing? - It's okay. Move move. Don't you fucking hurt her. PIease. Come on, MeI. Come on. - Jesus Christ, Mel. - Come on, come on! Come on, MeI. Come on, baby. Come on. Come on. Don't fucking die on me. Don't die on me. Come on. Fucking hurt her-- don't hurt her! ( coughs ) Yeah yeah, I'm here. I'm here. Come on, I'm here. l'm here. Oh, thank God. SaI: Here we go. Here we go. You're okay. You're okay. Come here. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Here you go, baby. ( crying ) You're okay. Look, baby, I never-- I never meant to say any of those things. l didn't mean it. I didn't mean it, I swear. I didn't mean any of those things I said to you. - Sal. - What, baby, what? About Cory. No, we don't need to taIk about that now. We don't need to talk about that now, baby. - MeI: Yes, we do. - SaI: No, we don't. No, we don't. No, we don't. - MeI: I'm so sorry. - Sal: lt's okay. Baby, it's okay. Mel: I'm so sorry. I never meant to hurt-- ( screams ) MeI! ( screaming ) Sara: No! ( waiIing ) What the heII was that? ( screaming ) lt got her. It fucking got her. lt's gonna get us too. It's gonna fucking get us too. ( both sobbing ) There's no way. It can't be. - There's no way. - What did you do? What did you do, you fuck? - What the fuck did you do? - Sal! You fucker! I'm gonna fucking kiII you! - Gonna fucking kiII you! - No! What are you gonna do? No, pIease don't, please don't! - No! - ( Bruce screaming ) SaI, Iet him go! SaI, stop! - SaI! - I'm gonna fucking kiII you. - Stop it, no! - ( aII screaming ) You fuck! - Sara, get me up! - Bruce, Bruce, come here. ( grunts ) Don't Iet go of me. - PIease don't Iet go of me! - HoId on. ( whimpers ) - No! - ( screams ) SaI! Sara! ( roars ) ( sobbing ) No. No! No-ooo. No. ( sobbing continues ) ( door cIosing ) ( sobbing ) They're dead. They're aII dead. ( sobs ) God, what have I done? What have I done? It's not your fauIt. Yes it is. I'm the piIot. I'm responsibIe. He knew it. My dad knew it. He knew it from the day we buried her. I wasn't aIIowed to see her body. AII I remember is the flowers on her casket. TuIips. TuIips were her favorite. ( sobbing ) God, I miss her. I miss her so much. I... I never beIieved she was reaIIy gone. But I thought maybe she was Iost somewhere, up there in that-- and if I Iearned to fly, I couId-- l could find her and bring her home. I want her to come home. This happened before and it's happening again. No. Bruce, no. This isn't about your parents or my mom or any conspiracy, okay? It's not about that! You're right, Sara. I know that now. Then what? It's me. What are you taIking about? I saw something I-- There-- there was a storm. TurbuIence. A cover of a magazine. I was scared. I imagined it happening to us. It did. No, that's insane. That's just a coincidence. Then what do you caII this, huh? What? A comic? Just Iook. What? - Cory: Coz, we shouId turn around. - Sara: I'm trying. Cory: 20,000 feet? SaI: Where the heII is the ground? MeI: You kiIIed him. This didn't break. It was cut. What are you saying? This-- this is some kind of curse? Aren't you Iistening? I made these things come true just by thinking about them. I shouId have never gotten on this pIane! - Why, because you're scared to fly? - Don't you get it? That's when it happens-- when I'm reaIIy scared. So you're teIIing me that this is some kind of fantasy world come to life? Sara, Iook around. This isn't fantasy. It's a nightmare. - ( gasps ) - ( shrieks ) I'm not gonna Iet us die! - You're never gonna outfly it. - We'll see. Hang on. ( shrieks ) ( shrieking continues ) Oh shit. Shit shit shit shit. ( screams ) Another hit Iike that and we're dead. I toId you. I toId you. I toId you. Are you reaIIy causing this? Is this reaIIy because of you? Then prove it. Make that thing go away. - I don't know how. - Make it go away! - I don't know how! - ( roaring ) Bruce, man is what he wiIIs himseIf to be. Sartre, right? Stop being such a pussy and face your fears. Face your fears! - ( shrieking ) - ( screaming ) Bruce, pIease stop. Do it, Bruce. ( screams ) Bruce, Bruce! Bruce! Jesus. It is you. Mayday mayday mayday, Yankee Zulu X-ray. Can anyone read me? ( static ) Mayday mayday mayday, Yankee Zulu X-ray. ( static ) This is Lakeview Center. Received your mayday. - What is your emergency? - I just got through to ground. We're gonna make it. You didn't mean it, did you? Mean what? That kiss. I care about you, Bruce. You know that. Bruce, Bruce! - I can't heIp it. - Yes you can! Oh no. Bruce, move. ( gIass shatters ) ( shrieks ) - Get us out of here. - It's not that simpIe. Why not? Just think us somewhere eIse. You don't understand. I've never made anything good happen in my Iife. What if I can't? ( screaming ) Bruce: No! Bruce! - Sara! - ( screams ) Sara! Bruce! - Sara! - Bruce, your parents, Bruce. Think of your parents. My parents? They wouIdn't want you to die like this. They'd want you to survive. Don't you understand? You can be with them again. AII you have to do is imagine it. - Sara! - Imagine it. ( Sara groans ) No-ooo! ( Sara gasping ) What happened? l did it. I thought of somewhere eIse. Oh no. ( screaming ) Where the heII did he come from? - Was that-- - I think so. - Did we just-- - Yeah. If you're gonna do your thing, now's the time. It's aIready done. Mom, Mom! I'm okay, sweetie. Everybody gets one near miss, right? Do you think they made it? I hope so. Hi, I'm Sara. Bruce. Go downtown, catch the early movie  The shows are cheaper  They don't mind if you put your feet up  She's out on the highway  She's got a homemade sign  It says, "Go ahead  Try to figure out what my future Iooks Iike"  I don't want to Iive my Iife Iike a story  Always thinking I couId've been something  Don't run aIongside and controI me  Just fiIm away and Iet me be  At ease, I  I feeI fine  I'II move on  I'II go on  There's something so divided  Don't worry about me, I'II be fine  Don't Iive your Iife for me or for anyone  You Iive your Iife as if you're one  You Iive your Iife as if you're one  Find quiet  It's awfuI quiet  How can you be mad? We've just got started  I want to shave my head, lie in bed  AII day Iong  How can you be mad? We've just got started  You Iive your Iife as if you're one  You Iive your Iife as if you're one  At ease, I  I feeI fine  I'II go on  I'II move on  Don't Iive your Iife like a movie  AIways thinking you couId've been something  Don't live your life for me or for anyone  You Iive your Iife as if you're one  You Iive your Iife as if you're one  Find quiet  It's awfuI quiet  Find quiet.
