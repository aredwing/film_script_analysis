Do you think I could stay in here with you guys? Outlook hazy. Try again. Please? I really need a place to stay. Signs point to no. Everybody's a comedian. Hello? Hello! Ahhhhhh! Ugh! Whew! Aaaah! Whoa! Oop! Huh? What are you doing in here? Hiding! Why? 'cause I'm scared! It's okay. I'm just a rubber ducky. I'm scared of rubber duckies! But I wouldn't hurt a fly. I'm scared of flies, too! Oop! Look, I just need a place to stay. Go away! Ah! Wait! Stay with me! Let me guess. Scared of thunder. Mm-hmm. Ah! Ooh! You're a jumpy little guy. Well, well being surrounded by bullies in a scary crate Does that to a toy. I had to get out of there! Me, too. That is, the other toys sort of kicked me out, Cause I'm uh... Different. I'm different from all the other tub toys. But how? I can't squeak. Really? That's great! It is? Yeah! I'm scared of squeaks! And I'm different, too. I can't squirt. My name's lucky. Lucky duck. They call me snap. Look, snap, you can't spend your whole life Hiding out in a shell. Why not? It's nice and cozy in here. You should get one! How are you gonna find a kid to take you home if you're hiding? Ahhhh! What are you doing in my cabin? Your cabin? Ugh, that stuffy crate was terrible for my complexion, So I have chosen this as my cabin for the voyage. They said you were a reject, too? Certainly not! Ha! How could anyone consider two different colored eyes To be a flaw, When it's actually a sign of rare beauty? Oop! I merely decided to go on this ocean cruise To um... Get some sun. I've been looking a little pink lately. Ha ha, I see. And then, they kicked you out of the crate for being a re... Heh heh! A really unhappy passenger? Eh, something like that. The name's flo. Flo the hippo. You've probably heard of me. No, not really. Oop! At any rate, if you don't mind finding someplace else... Uh, but we were kind of here first. Weren't we, snap? Snap? Oop! Ahhh! Don't mind him. He's just a little shy. It's okay if you stay here with us. But she's pink, and... You're scared of pink? Exactly. You can always go back into your little shell and hide there. But... boo! Aaah! I suppose this arrangement will do. Arrangement? What arrangement? Boo! Ahhh! I think I could get used to this. What's that? Come on. Let's go check it out! Hey! Give me a hand here! Hey! Hey! There's a storm coming! You better take shelter! Lighten up, will ya? It's time to have some fun! Come on, tub toys! See those waves rollin' and a tumblin' Feel the beat rockin' and a rumblin' Oh, whoa! Slap your fins on the deck now pucker up and make a squeak, it can't be missed it's the tub toy twist and you do it like this the tub toy twist time to party, let's take it overboard Come on monkeys, bang and clang it all night long shimmy, shake it, frogs and tugs let's do the dance we all love and it goes like this it's the tub toy twist Uh, storm's coming. And you shake it like this it's the tub toy twist Look at that wave! It's the tub toy twist the tub toy twist That's what I call makin' a splash! Um, no, that is! Ahhh! Swim to the vent! Get in! Well, you wanted to take a nice ocean cruise. This was not in the brochure! I'm getting seasick! Ahhhhh! Ugh! Awesome! Wahoo! Again! Ahhh! Whoa! Uh-oh! Whoa! Ugh! During this historic storm, No ships or human lives were lost at sea, But a crate of tub toys was swept overboard In the middle of the ocean. With me now is the owner of the terrific tub toy company, Mr. Bob bubbly. We're offering a substantial reward And calling on anyone with a boat To help find our poor lost tub toys. A reward? Dad! Ugh! Dad! Hey, dad! Ow! Sorry, dad, But there's this thing they're talking about on tv! They need boats to help find some tub toys That were lost at sea! Tub toys? Yeah! Everyone's looking for them. There's a reward and everything! Reward? Are you sure? I'll show you. Come on! You guys okay? Uh, I think so. But the service aboard this ship leaves a lot to be desired. Oh, I had an awful dream. There was this big storm and we went overboard and then we... Aaaah! It wasn't a dream! What do you guys think? Not too bad, huh? Hey, out there! Is everyone all right? Yup! What are you doing? What does it look like we're doing? We're floating. That's what tub toys do. Don't you want to get back to the ship? Why? We're finally free! Free to float away on the ocean waves! But... Who knows where the waves are going to take you? Yeah. Who knows? Maybe it'll be a tropical island, With coconuts and palm trees! What's wrong with you guys? Don't you want to find a kid who'll take you home And play with you? Why settle for a kid's bathtub when you can have a whole ocean? They might be right, lucky. Maybe it's better to just sit back And let the ocean waves take us where they will. But... but... Where's my spf 900? I need to work on my tan. Well, I don't want to go anywhere. I just want to stay in here, where it's safe. Look, just because we're reje... I mean, different... Doesn't mean we should give up. We've got to find a kid! Ha! A squeakless duck, A scaredy-cat turtle who can't squirt, And a stuck-up hippo with two different color eyes? Hey! No offense. But what kid's going to want us? I know there's a kid out there for me, And I'm gonna find him! If we follow the ship's trail, we might just catch up to it! And if we can get back to the ship, It'll take us to dry land, Where we can all find a home... Somewhere. What are you gonna paddle with? Your face? Ha ha ha. Well, why not? Hmm. I'm ready! Hmmm, sorry, danny, But it could get rough out there with these storms around. But I really wanna be your first mate! Look, danny. This is an important salvage job. A reward like that could pay for the repairs we need On the finders keepers. But dad, I promise I won't touch anything. Oh, ah, whoa! I'm sorry, son. I know you'll make a fine first mate some day, But today is not that day. Now, head over to your grandmother's house And tell her I'll be back before supper to get you. Ah! My charts! Huh? Hmm. Okay, phew! It won't be long now. Not getting very far, duck! Look, why don't you forget about this "finding a kid" stuff, And just chill like the rest of us? I'm not like the rest of you, Or so you keep telling me. What about you two oddballs huh? Hmph! I suppose you're going along with the silly duck's plan? Do you want to float around with those guys And wait for something to happen? Or do you want to come with me and make it happen? Waiting is not my strong suit. I'm going with the duck! Okay. Let me get this straight. You want me to float away on an ocean full of killer whales, Barracudas, electric eels, manta rays, Hammerheads, octopuses... Octopi. Right, those too. No, thank you. I'll take my chances with the rubber duck. Suit yourselves. Good luck with that! Hmm. Um, what is the plan, anyway? Sinking, by the look of it. What?! We're sinking? Help! I need a floatation device! Get off! You are a floatation device. Oh! Huh? Catch! Maybe we can hitch a ride. Hey! Hey you! Could I just... Hold it!!! Do you wanna do something really fun? What is it? Tell us! Tell us! What is it? Chasing a ship! Oooh! We love chasing ships! They're so... Shippy! If you give us a ride, we'll show you where one is. Yes! Yes! Show us! Show us! Follow that trail and it'll lead you right to it. A ride? On the back of a dolphin? It'll be fine. Just do what I do. Hey! Wow! Neat trick! Whoa! How can I stick to a dolphin? Where's the glue? I don't get it. This makes no sense. Ugh! Ugh! Hey, I'm stuck! Exactly. Relax and enjoy the ride. I'm relaxed. You gotta roll with it! You gotta dive! You gotta roll with it! And take a ride! You gotta roll with it! You gotta dive! What? Whoa! You gotta roll with it! You gotta dive! You gotta roll with it! And take a ride! No roll! Whoa! Cut it out! Ahhh! Yay! You gotta roll with it! And take a ride! Wahoo! I'm king of the duckies! Boo! Aaah! That never gets old. Oh, look! It's the ship! It won't be long now before we find our kid! Uh, why are you stopping? Ooh! What is it? Ooh! Look at that! Shiny! Shiny! Ah, whoa! Wait! Wait! Hold on! I thought we were chasing the ship? Shiny! Oh, that's just a buoy! There's nothing fun about a buoy at all. Oh, buoy. Hmm, what is that? Could be onto something here. Ah... Ah-choo! What in the world... danny? What are you doing here? I'm sorry, dad, I just really wanted to come. So, you went and stowed away? I promise I won't cause any problems. You already have. Whatever that was, I lost it. I didn't mean to be any trouble. I know, son. I'm just worried about you. It can be dangerous out here. And it's too late to turn back. So, does that mean I can stay? It looks like you'll have to. Oh, yes! Can I be first mate? Pay attention, do your job, And you might make first mate, some day. Aye-aye, sir! Help! Anybody! We're gonna be marooned here for the rest of our lives! You know, this might not be such a bad place To spend the rest of our lives. It's got music... And the lighting makes me look gorgeous, don't you think? We can't stay here. We're supposed to find kids who'll play with us. But that ship is long gone by now. Then, we'll just have to get to dry land by ourselves somehow. If we can get to land, there are bound to be kids, And swimming pools, and fountains, and bubble baths. Mmm, bubble baths! Nice thought, But it doesn't change the fact that we're stuck here! We'll get out of here. There's got to be a way. How? Do you think help is just going to fall out of the sky? Oh, sorry 'bout that! Whoa! Didn't see ya down there. Aaah! Hey! Watch it, pal! Aaah! Hmm, looks like this buoy ain't big enough for all of us. Aaah! Leave him alone! Listen, we've already been kicked out of our crate, Blown off our ship by a storm, Stranded in the middle of the ocean, Stuck to the backs of some dippy dolphins, And abandoned on this overcrowded buoy! We've had kind of a rough day, So we'd appreciate it if you'd just... Give us a break!!! All right, okay! Sheesh! Why didn't ya say so? We'd be happy to help, right, boys? Name's wingo, leader of the thunderbeaks! Nice to meet you. Hi. Hello. I'm lucky. You coulda fooled me. So, you wanna fly with the thunderbeaks? Ha ha, well, I'm just a rubber ducky. I don't really have wings. No sweat. Youse can hitch a ride. Oh! Whoa! Hey! Yikes! Thunderbeaks! Let's r-r-r-ride! Not again! Whoa! Ah! Dad! Dad! They're talking about it on the radio! Whoa! Oh, no! I'll get them! Danny! Sorry! I just got excited. They said they found some of the tub toys on a beach. Show me where. Come on! Here, I think. Well, the cargo ship lost the tub toys here. So, the ocean currents must be carrying them south. So, all we have to do is head south, And we should find the rest. Setting course due south. Full speed ahead. Man the fog light! Aye, captain! Danny! How in the world are we supposed to make it through that With no fog light?! I'm sorry, dad. I didn't mean it. It's okay, son, we'll make it through somehow. Come on, let's go. Man, this stuff is thick. Can't see my wing in front of my face! So, where we takin' youse guys, anyways? All we want is to find a kid who'll take us home. So, we need to get to dry land somewhere. No sweat. That is, if we can spot any land in this pea soup. Hey, snap, look at me! Huh? Whoa! Aaah! Hey, I can't see! Get off, will ya! Watch it! Ahhhh! Are you okay? What happened? Argh! A three-bird pile-up! It... it was this fog. Grr! Hey! We're down here! Hey, seagulls! We're down here! Oh, it's no good. They're gone. And we're goners! No, we're not. We'll keep going. But how are we gonna find our way through this fog? If you want to get somewhere bad enough, you find a way. Even through the fog. When you can't see ahead you're lost and afraid gotta believe, be strong and just hold on your heart will light the way through the fog Just can't seem to ever get it right. I'm trying really hard but nothing goes my way. But even when it's feeling dark as night, A quiet voice inside me seems to say. Listen to the sound I know this fear is only make-believe. Beating like a drum Trust that you know what you should do. When you can't see ahead Won't listen to the doubt in me. Let the hope wash over me. You're lost and afraid Won't listen to the doubt in me. Gotta believe, be strong and carry on Let the hope wash over me. Your heart will light the way through the fog If I listen to it carefully, A quiet voice inside of me seems to say. Your heart will light the way through the fog your heart will light the way through the fog Hey! What's that? Huh? Hmm. Could be land! Good eye! Oh! You think so? Which one? The blue one compliments my outfit, But the green one is just so unique. Oh, boy. It's land, all right! Dry land! Yechh! Kind of wet, actually. Looks a little empty. Hmm. I hope there's someplace I can get my nails done. I think we're on an island. I'm scared of islands! What is that? Not sure. Hello? Is there anybody down there? Let me give it a try. He said, "hello, is there anybody down..." Waahh! Help, ahh! Wait a minute. This isn't an island. It's a whale! Ahhh! I wanna get off! Ah! Whoo! Get out of the way! Oh, brother. Doesn't this thing ever sit still? Just hang on. Lucky will get us out of this. Um, un case you haven't noticed, He was swallowed by the whale! I need to get out of here. Ugh! Huh? Now if I could just find something... Hmm? It's no use. Don't know why flo and snap ever went with me in the first place. I was supposed to help them find a kid. It was all just a useless dream... "I'm a lucky duck..." Guess I'm not so lucky after all. Well, I did find some friends, But now I lost them, too. Thanks to this big, dumb whale! Whoa! I think we're stuck out here for good this time. Maybe it's for the best. What do you mean? I mean, what if they were right? What if my "distinctive feature" Makes people think I really am a reject? You're not a reject! You're just different, that's all. It's the same thing. No, it's not. Being different makes you stand out from all the rest. You're beautiful because you're different. Your eyes are amazing, and so are you. I am? Ha ha ha, yes! Of course I am! Now, let's find a way to get lucky out of there! Right! Huh? We just have to get this whale to spit him out. Or better yet, sneeze him out! How? We put something small and irritating right in here. But-but we don't have anything small and irrita... Oh, no. Oh, come on! You want to save lucky, don't you? Of-of course! Of course! But maybe in some way that doesn't involve Jumping into a whale's blowhole! Ah! There is no other way. Are you sure? There's nothing less... Blowhole-y? I can't do it! Yes, you can. But what if something goes wrong? What could go wrong? Ahh! Seriously? Okay, okay. A lot of things could go wrong. But there are times when you have to stop hiding And be brave for your friends. Friends? Me, silly. And lucky, of course. I actually have friends? Best friends! You know the day I met ya, I thought I could forget ya hidin' out in that ol' shell I scared ya and I teased ya, but now I'll never leave ya back then how could we ever tell that we were going to be friends right to the very end so I'll tell you again don't have to be afraid a friend will always see you through it's funny how your feelings grow and suddenly you're my pal so when your feeling down and low just call me 'cause I'm your gal just the two of us friends right to the very end so I'll tell you again don't have to be afraid, 'cause friends will always see you through so you should always know This friend will always see you through ooh ooh Aww! Okay, I'll do it. For my friends. Turtle in the hole! Ahh! Whoa! Let's face it. I'm never getting out of he... Waaah! Lucky! Snap! Flo! Ahhh! What happened? Your best friends got you out of there, that's what! It's funny how your feelings grow and suddenly you're my pal so when you're feeling down and low just call me 'cause I'm your gal yes the three of us friends right to the very end so I'll tell you again and now we really know your friends will always see you through and now we really know your friends will always see you through Ha ha! Where are we? The same place we were the last 12 times you asked. The middle of the ocean. Ugh! You! Yup, it looks like we're right back where we started. So, what have you guys been doing? Oh, pretty much just hanging around by the pool. Hmm, you know, that sounds pretty good to me. After all, I'm tired. And I'm starting to think this whole dream Of finding a kid is just that. A silly dream. What? There's nothing silly about dreams. They give you something to believe in. Don't you get it? It's over. All I ever did was make things harder for us. At least if we stay here, things can't get any worse. Oh, yes, they can! We've been through too much to stop now. And we would never have made it this far if it wasn't for you. We're not rejects, lucky, we're different, remember? I think that makes us special. You taught us that. And that we should never, ever give up on our dreams! Wow. You must've had a pretty rough time out there. Maybe I was wrong about that whole reject thing. Ahhhh! Hey, you seem pretty handy in a pinch. You think you could help us get out of here? Ahhh! This storm looks pretty bad. After the way you treated us? Hmph. Why should we help you? Because we're tub toys. And tub toys stick together. We're getting out of here. Okay, everyone, into the pool! Whoa! Hang on, danny! The mast is pulling the ship down. I've got to cut it loose! Take the wheel! Are you sure? You can do it, son. Steady as she goes. Whoa! Okay. Ahhh! Dad! Danny, no! It's too dangerous! Ugh! Let's get inside, danny. Whew! You were right, dad. It can be really dangerous out here. I should have never stowed away like that. I'm so sorry, dad. No, I'm sorry. I should never have doubted you in the first place. You really came through back there. I'm proud of you, danny. Whoa! Are you sure this was a good idea? No. I'm all out of those! Help! He-e-e-elp! Wingo? Is that you? Yo, duck! I thought I lost ya! I've been flyin' all over lookin' for youse guys, And it kinda got me in a little, uh, trouble here. He needs help!

Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Heave! We did it! We found them! Hey, take care, lucky. I hope ya find your kid! And so, the storm has passed. It's the finders keepers! Hurrah! Woo-hoo-hoo! And they've found the lost tub toys! Oh, welcome home! Oh! Here you go, kids! Enjoy! Captain chase, how did you do it? How did you find them in the storm? Well, I never could have done it without my trusty first mate. Wow! Aye, captain. Oops. Your reward, captain! Well done. Hey, wait. You forgot about these. Thanks! Hmm, oh dear. But it looks like these are rejects. They're no good to me. Hmmm. Can I keep 'em? They're not in great shape. That one doesn't even squeak. Yeah, but there's something special about these three. Aren't you a little old for tub toys? You're never too old for tub toys! A bubble bath! Oh, I've dreamed of this all my life! I guess dreams can come true. Only if you've got a lucky duck to see you through. Was that you? No. You? Uh-uh. It's funny how your feelings grow and suddenly you're my pal so when you're feeling down and low just call me 'cause I'm your gal yes the three of us friends right to the very end so I'll tell you again and now we really know your friends will always see you through and now we really know your friends will always see you through
