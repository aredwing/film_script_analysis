But from the shadows came Crane, warrior of all warriors - - And the bearer of the gods' swords. He liberated man - - And led them to victory. But the price of victory was high. For Crane got an ulcer through the heart, - - Who bled for seven days and seven nights. And a hundred warriors drank his blood. And parades his strength. And Crane looked at them and saw that it was good. And then he died. Thus was created the barbarians, - - Sons of Crane. Oh, yeah. Yes. Listen, folks. Strength! Mod! Fearlessness! This is what there was a wreath gift to our people. For thousands of generations, Generation after generation, - - Has his blood rushing undiluted in our veins. This is what we celebrate every year, before we go on expeditions. But first and foremost is the crown of blood that makes - - That we are barbarians the greatest warriors throughout Metalonien.

A son of Crane draws on expeditions and killing monsters and returning in glory. - It is the essence of being a barbarian. - Uncle, look at me. What should I do to monsters? Buckle muscle suit and hope they die of laughter? What then, Ronal? Have you got a mullet? Fucking funny. Have you got any brain cells? What? Where? If there is one on the back, bother you then press it out? Listen here, kid. When you go on expeditions, is it about big balls - - Than the arms. Heroism.

He is a mighty warlord this prince Volcazar that you are talking about. zakidernes dark force protects him. Now I was so seen nor interested in fighting with him. Volcazar crave power across Metalonien. So far, no been able to stop him. Wow. An impenetrable armor encloses his body. No weapon bites on him. Only one sword has strength to crush him. See. - Oh, sick. - What's so special about it? It should especially you know, barbarians. This is the crown of swords. It's a joke, right? Honestly, it do not exist. Everybody has been looking for the damn sword - - In thousands of years, and nobody has found it. It's a silly story. Wreath sword is not a myth. Only this can damage the princes Volcazar. You can never save your village outside to get at him first. But I can not. Only a great warrior without fear the heart will be able to use it. Without a great warrior You will not defeat Volcazar. And without a great warrior would your tribe be damned! But I can also be indifferent. I'm just a pundit. It's not my fault that the barbarians have been kidnapped, do you? Gu'ra zul! Wizard! Lord, time is fast approaching. zakidernes temple must be awakened soon. Otherwise it becomes impossible to perform the ritual. Is Wreath sons caught? - My mission is complete. - Fantastic. Now nothing can stop us. Mighty zaal. Wreath sons are gathered. Awake from your lethargy! What is happening? Finally. - What? - What now? The mighty Zaal is not satisfied. The absence of one son of Crane. - Impossible. Unless ... - I do not understand ... - We left none alive. - Fool! I need the blood of all living barbarians, and then you let one escape. - I can not explain. - Find him for me. Now! for they are in raid Alibert and Ronal the greatest heroes in Metalonien uh-uh it's going so well and the girls they say Alibert you're so delicious My village has been burned, and I must find Wreath sword. Can not the devil be quiet for five minutes so that I can think of? - I sing a song barbarian instead. - For God's sake, no. Crane and he drew his proud sword and drove with all his force blade deep in Zakidens must skull burst Wait a minute. The song. What was it? "Lays Wreath". There are 2073 verses and I do them all by heart. Crane gets totally much pussy. - Why did not you say something? - That he gets pussy? No, about the song. It's about Crane. You have sung a verse of his sword. Is there one that tells you where it is? from the crown of his chest the blood flowed it was bleeding day and night No no. After he dies. Come on.

Curse! Fabulous, my lord. One hits more and you have beaten your record. But we must find the last Son of Crane before the next full moon. - You destroy my concentration. - I beg your pardon. - Hello? - The target escaped, sir. The task is harder than we thought. He enlists the help of a strong warrior. We will need reinforcement. I tolerate no insults! Bring them to me. Both of them. Do you know where we are? It seems as if we go in circles. The wind speaks to my soul. We are soon in elves' realm. You said that two days ago. We're lost, dammit. We die of thirst. - Ha. - What is it that's so funny? I have heard of barbarians against and strength, but you have neither. You just go and whine and hiss. It's funny when you consider the family you come from. Why are you with if you think I whining? - What is your deal with the barbarians? - It's my own affair. Stop! See. - And that means ...? - We elves can communicate with everything. I unite myself with its soul and causes it to show us the output. Kormamin lindua ka'elja. Kormamin lindua ... Ouch! My beautiful elf lip! There. On the other side. There is no maze on the other side. The entrance to the elven kingdom. I did it. Elves Port, I greet you. Did you not think it was an entrance? - Oh! Wild! - Come on. Stop! First, our souls are weighed the gatekeeper. Only those of the right casting may be allowed to go through. What about those not have the proper casting? Who? Well. They are crushed by the rock wall. - Well, shall we go? - Well it I can not. - What? - I am a miserable barbarian. I have not exactly the right casting. - It is not meant that way. - Forget it. We go around it. When you are on the raid, , follow the directory. The only thing we get out of it is to be killed. But now you call it a raid, remember that it is my cruise. And I decide that we go outside the ridiculous port. Come on! See. No booby traps, no gates, no anything. This expedition-nonsense is so predictable. If just thinking a bit outside ... - Ouch, my tailbone, man. - What the hell was that? We have offended gatekeeper. I sense ... ... great danger! Run! Faster! Ronal! Come! Ouch, man. Fool! Your moronic idea was to beat us all to death. I tried just to steer us out of trouble. You tried? Here the "samples" just not good enough, Ronal. On a mission there will always be problems. Solve them instead of going around it. This is the Elves Temple. The focal point of all wisdom in the world. Wisdom book of lies in the tower's upper chamber - - So the moon can read in the on his journey across the night sky. It is the holiest of holies. - Fair enough. So is it that we have to get up. - Hush! See. No one from outside should get into. The King Archers have eyes like hawks. - Shit. - They kill everything they see. So it must be the hard way. I take the front two. No. - I do it. - What? Alone. Think about it. They kill you, as soon as they see you. I know, - - But they will not see me. There is not much left and I am the least of us. Wait here. This one I could have used in high school. What do l do? Smart, no? - What? - You are missing a spot. Fuck! It is empty. Fuck, it's typical. Relax, Ronal. They are small dumplings Nobody will notice. - Wait here. - Let be, Ronal. You will be killed. Ouch! "I have a headache," "I'm tired" "The kids wake up!" And blah, blah, blah. With such a wife is the bummer, one lives forever. Rvnederen! Ouch! Who's there? Well, there was not a damn thing anyway. - What then? Are you ready for this Saturday? - Are you crazy? I was born ready! - Coolest! - I just have to be psycho-baskelam! There is open. Ouch! Fuck, I'm in bad shape. Oh! Accursed rat! Oh! Wow. There it is. So what is what here? Wreath sword - - Wreath sword how the hell finderjeg Wreath sword? There's that damn. Wreath sword. Well, but it was easy enough. It's like when no one who discovers. - A killer rat! - Kill the rat! Use the poisoned arrows. After it! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! Faster! Shoot it down! - Ow, damn it! - Yes! Pig is down! Well, how much takes you to drink? - Nothing. I'll smoke me on the floor. - Did you get hold of Elrond mother's weed? Av. The card says that Crane was buried in eternity Mountain. My elfin soul feel it is far, far ... Is not it there? ... it is just nearby. Destiny is on our side. Av. Not. - I mistook you. - What? There in the temple. You did it. Yes, almost certainly. You do barbarians honor. Uh. Thank you. Well, but ... I have also an ax to be sanded. I got to thinking ... I've never really been told ... ... thanks for that you took with me. Actually anerjeg not know how would have done it without you. Uh ... okay. Well, we'd better get some sleep. Maybe we crown the sword tomorrow. I keep watch. We elves do no sleep. I can safely sleep. - May I ask you something, Ronal? - Uh, yes, of course. How are the barbarians? - They're not very clever. - I thought more ... How are they here? Well. Uh. A barbarian is always ready to help one when you need it. Regardless of how dangerous and disruptive it is. And they go on raids constant. They are not afraid of anything. Hard to believe I am one of them, huh? - And they are good fighters, right? - Yep. The best in the world. It's just so hard to find a decent fighter. Yes. Uh, what? I come from an ancient lineage of skjoldmer. Far, far away from here. Our religion requires that I only marry the one who can defeat me. Many have tried to win over me - - But I was too strong. And for every duel I won, I was just stronger. Meanwhile, I could only watch as the other found himself a girlfriend. One by one. Eventually I was the only one left. It took longer and longer between that someone dared to challenge me. Then the suitors just up get. The top of the trunk became impatient. They told me to go into world to find a worthy husband. A warrior with the strength to defeat me. If one kills me, I will obey his slightest command. There have been no, who were strong enough. But everywhere I've been, say, Barbarians are the strongest warriors - - So maybe a barbarian from your village meet me. - That's why I went with you. - Uh ... Okay. - Okay, what? - Well, then ... What you just said, what it has to do with love? I would love that conquers me. I've waited so long. Wow. I have never told this to anyone before. It feels so ... nice. You know, Ronal? It is actually nice talking to you. You are also lovely. - Uh, talk to, I think. - Well. And if I had meant it in the otherwise, would we have beaten. - No, it would not be so fortunate. - It would be a little strange. - What was it? - I do not know. Hey, Elric. Elves do not sleep. - What is it that says the sound? - I sense a common voice. No one escapes Prince Volcazars anger! Ronal, beware! Zandra! - Curse! - Ronal, wait for me! Ronal! Oh, fuck! Satan! They are gone. No! Move! Zandra! - No, no, no. - We find her. If we go now so we collect them. Come. - What did you do? - I do not know. The Amazons. - It's stuck. - Congratulations, honey. ... simply so much sun. See my new shoes. Are not they amazing? - It's only women. - I died and gone to heaven. - Hi, girls. What is happening? - What is that? - Oh, totally botched stomach pouch. - Hello. Good to see you. High Queen, we have captured these women in the jungle. We have taken them with them, so they can decide their fate. Stand them up. Let me see them. Maximum remarkable women. I've never seen anything like it. - What is it? - Ow! - One even has hair on his chin. - How clumsy! - High Queen. - Ten, shoddy girl. - Who has asked you to speak? - We are not women. - Well, we are such men then, no? - Men? - Or so nearly so. - Men? Heaven be praised. The gods have heard our prayers and sent us two men. Finally the time has arrived where we can pursue our tribe. Before them the sacred mating cabins. - What? - What! We take the thin first. Him here we save for tomorrow. No, help. No, I will not! Honestly, man. It can not be l you know. I will also be paired with. It's fucking typical it here. No! - Lord. - What's new? We have caught the warrior who has barbarian helped to escape. Looking at it. A skjoldm. - And a very pretty one. - Give me a gun and let me fight. Each thing in its time. No one put a hand on me with impunity. So die then! Impressive. You are a woman of my choice. Sad that I will have to to kill you! What? Foolish woman. I know your rules skjoldm. You must obey me now. It is your destiny. You have defeated me. Bunkering piercing is too fat. Double piercing is the shit. Yes! It was damn time. Is it my turn? The ceremony is over. You will be used tomorrow. - What? Tomorrow? - The queen's order. Come back! I will also be abused! - Did you lock? - Of course. Hey, what are you doing? - We must leave. - What about all the Amazons? Zandra is in danger. We must find Wreath sword and help her. - Can he wait a week. - We can not leave her behind. - Can not we find another warrior? - I want Zandra! Hello, you would not have her help to start with. Fuck you! I will be here and having hot love with hot babes. It's the only reason I was taken with the expedition. Oh, I forgot. You're not on expeditions. You're just fucking boring. Fine. Stay here. You are not to help a damn thing anyway. Oh, I just love the song. Damn! Fucking shit! Oh, what the fuck I walk in, man? Ronal, I come. - My queen? - I just had to see you. Ever since I saw you the first time is my body trembled with longing. I know it's against the rules, But I must have you. - If I may ... - I can not control myself. Take me! Take me! Oh! Yes! Take me! Stop! Unfortunately I can not, Mrs. Queen. My friend needs me. What? Maybe I can be taken prisoner again on the return trip. Alarm! - Pigs! Some men are pigs! - Insanity bitches, man! - L progresses from your responsibility! - And l pissing on board! Men just hung from my balls! Elric? It's all the first barbarians. Wow. Hello.

And then straps you up here, just as my skjoldm said you would. Wreath sword. The only weapon in the world that can harm you. Zandra? Excellent. You have served me well. - As you have commanded me, my lord. - What the hell is happening? Move! The barbarians are here a rendezvous with my mage. I sense that Ronal is in great danger. - Do what you must, sorcerer. - With pleasure, sir. - Ronal? - Gorak? - There you go. - No, no, no! Finally! Mighty Zaal, listen to your humble servant! Blood from the crown of the sons are gathered. Grant us access to your temple! What are you doing? Only once every ten thousand years, it possible for Zaal, Zakidernes god - - Get in touch with our world. I offer the ultimate sacrifice. The sons of the warrior who sent him into exile to the hereafter. And as a reward he will give me His divine power. All will undergo - - Or die! Pis. We can no longer reach without being detected. Ronal! What the hell's wrong with you? Come on! Lift your feet! Come on! Up the stairs with you! Wait here. - Ronal. - Alibert! - What? - Hold up, however. Going forward, you wretch.
