[HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [SIRENS WAILING] [SNARLING ROCK MUSIC] The high hawk knows where the rabbit goes And the buzzard marks the kill But few there be with eyes to see The tall men riding still we hark in vain on the speeding train For an echo of hoof beat thunder And the yellow wheat is a winding sheet For cattle trails plowed under Hoof dust flies at the low moon's rise And the bullbat's lonesome whir s an echoed note from the longhorn throat A steer, as it were Inch by inch, time draws the cinch Till the saddles creak no more And they the lords of the cattle hordes Shall tally a final score Oh, the tall men riding under the phantom moon oh, the tall men riding hoof beats like hammers of doom Oh, the tall men riding under the phantom moon oh, the tall men riding hoof beats like hammers of doom This is the song that the night birds sing As the phantom herds trail by Horn by horn where the long plains throw The flat miles to the sky and this is the song that the night birds wail Where the Texas plains lie wide Over the dust of a ghostly trail Where the phantom tall men ride Oh, the tall men riding under the phantom moon oh, the tall men riding hoof beats like hammers hoof beats like hammers of doom Under the phantom moon Under the phantom moon
