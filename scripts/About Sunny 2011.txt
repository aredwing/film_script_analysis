You don't see too many girls in here. Yeah. No, it's just a close bar for me. It's just... Close place to get a drink, whatever. Shh, shh. Go get dressed, hon. There's no school today. - You don't got school today? - It's Columbus Day. Well, go get dressed and wash your face. Listen. I... I, uh... I had a nice time. Hey, do you, um... Do you think I could get a hundred dollars? You wanna borrow a hundred dollars? Well... You work at that place, don't you? - No. - Yeah. You do. No. It's just... I could really use it. Look, I don't got that kind of money. Well, why not? Aren't you, like, a ballplayer and all that? Look, I'm sor... I had a nice time. You wanna get something to eat? Is he coming? Look at this. You're gonna need some new shoes, huh? Mm-hmm. I'll take the dog out for you. I'm gonna be late. Almost forgot about you, huh? All right, let's... Uh-oh. Come on. Fuck. Sunny! We'll go eat. You know what you want? Go ahead. Read it and tell her what you want. All right, we'll just have two of the 2.99 breakfast specials. That's scrambled? Scrambled. - And coffee comes with that, right? - Yeah. - Do you have your players card? - Oh, yeah. Got ya. This is nice, huh? Well, I'm gonna call a car. And they can take you to Jenny's, if that's what you want. Okay. That'd be nice. You get the day off. Can I go get a pie? They sell pie at breakfast? Well, I mean, it's definitely a flood. I know it's a flood, but it's, you know, not a natural one, and that's... Okay. Okay. Yeah. Well, you're probably fine, but I'm here if you change your mind. Mm-hmm. There's no direct extension, but anybody here can help you start a policy. Yeah. It's a call center. Mm-hmm. - Hi. Sorry. - Hold on a minute, will ya? Max, um, I was hoping that if... if, um, Ted comes walking through here, could you maybe just tell him I'm around? If I'm around, sure. Actually, looks like Ted needs you. Yeah. Mm-hmm. They're gonna use the lot. We can triple the investment. Okay. You wanted to see me? We're getting a new software package, okay? Which means all of us are gonna have to use the computers. I'm just bringing everyone in in person to see if there are any issues with that. - Yeah, that sounds great. - All right. - So you got a big investment coming up? - Yeah, what, on the phone? You know the dirt lot across the street? They're gonna run a gas line through it. I know the guy who's got the lease. He doesn't know anything about that. We take over the lease, we could triple it. I always mean to invest. You know, you always hear about that. "Invest for the future." So... You want in? I mean, we could maybe give you a share for... 2,000. - And I could triple it? - That's what we're talking about. But you gotta come in soon, by the end of the week. We close on Friday. Okay. I will. Good. Give me your cell. We'll work on the details later. You know what? It's new, so I can never remember the number. - Look it up on the phone. - I don't have it with me. It's at home. I don't like to take personal calls at work. Hey, give it to me later. This will be good. - Yeah. - Yeah. Shh. Thought you were going home. Oh. Yeah. I'm just waiting on a car. How far are ya? I can take ya. Well, what about Ted? I mean, don't you gotta work? I'll take you, I'll come back. Come on. What's this? Oh, uh, that's just work. You take pictures? Portraits. Part-time, at the mall. That's really nice. All right. Maybe I can come in for a minute and use the bathroom? Um, yeah, you know, Sunny is kind of shy. - Oh. - Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah. Sunny? That's her name? Uh, yeah. Sunny. Let me see. I don't know. I think these are narrow. Here. All right. What do you say? We go with these, huh? Hmm? Come on. They got the little... pink stripy guys on 'em. What about Keds? What's the difference, Sunny, right? If they had 'em here, I'd get 'em. I want what I had. Well, we're here now, and these are fine. I still gotta get stuff for your party, and I gotta get back to work. Hi. Go get your stuff. I can charge these, right? So which is it? You're gonna wear 'em or not? All right, fine. Fuck it. One cheeseburger meal? Yeah. And a shake. Just with a normal drink, like a coke, and also a number three. What, are you... What, are you... You're not hungry? You don't wanna eat? Are you gonna eat the Happy Meal or what? I'm gonna go get a shake. You know what? No. We're going. Come here. Take your food... so you can eat it at home. Here. Can't look for shoes for you all day and then have you throw a fit. Hi. Can I have a car at the Galleria Mall, please? Yeah, how much is that gonna be? It's gonna be a minute, so... might as well eat. Let's take the bus. - I'm not taking the bus. - I can eat on the bus. We're not taking the fuckin' bus, Sunny, so eat that or I'm gonna take it away! Come on. It's too late to go back to work now too. All right, I'll be back in a bit. I can give you five dollars. Yeah. Leave it on the table there. How's your girl? - Oh, she's good. - Yeah? Yeah. She's growin'. Sonny, right? Uh-huh. Like Sonny and Cher? No, it's not a man's name. It's... It's... S- U-N-N... It's like the sun, you know? Sunny. You still dancing? I never danced there. Mom, these are too hard. What? Oh, God. Don't eat it. It's okay. It's not okay. It's not okay. You gotta eat. - We can order pizza. - Honey, we can't. You want some soup? Just microwave it, and it'll become soft. Let's see. It's good. It's hot. Be careful. This isn't fair. Look, I just wanted to see, uh, maybe what was going on with the money, you know. 'Cause, um, I got this investment coming up. No, it's with work. You can come here. Please. I never said that. No, that is not true. Yeah, well, you know what? I'm not the one... Why don't you stop worrying about me? Why don't you stop worrying about me? Yeah? Well, when? Come on. Yes! I can't take you every day though. You know that, right? - I know. - Good. Yeah, I liked being a waitress. It was great 'cause you got to eat. You know? Be no good for me. I eat enough dog shit as it is. - You like it? - What, the job? I love it. It's the best. But you know what? Every month, this guy gives me five bucks a pop... for some names, their socials, e-mails. What's he do with them? Mm-mm-mm. It's 400 bucks though. Jesus. I could see if he needs some more. Huh? No. Well, I can get you a deal for your little girl. If you want some portraits of her. It iher birthday tomorrow. I gotta get back. Come by tonight. I'm on till 9:00. I'll try. Like... Like, how much would that be? Just come by. So, how are we today, good? Yeah. That is quite a little blouse you got there. Oh, don't forget about our little talk. Hey, you mind if I ask... Wha... You work for a separate company, right? What do they pay? Is that part-time only? After 11:00 or mornings. So, like, who would I talk to if I wanted to, you know... I used to... Hey. Mrs. Harwood? Oh. Jerome. - Angela is fine. - Sorry. Harwood's her dad's name. I'm sorry I'm late. Next time if you, um... You can't leave her here this long. Yeah, no, sometimes, she goes home with friends. But, uh, you know, today I had the car, so I-I... I told her to wait. Do you have a minute? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Uh, have you ever tested Sunny for reading difficulties? No. No. I know. I will. You know? If you think that I should. You know, we're not... we're not always right. And she's young, and dyslexia is tricky. But we just recommend testing. Okay. That's something the school does, right? I often recommend private consultation. It's... Well, it's better. It's faster. And, uh, you must know someone who could help. Why would I know someone? Being a nurse. All right, listen. You know what? I'll, uh... If you have a test or whatever, I'll let her take it, but I don't know anybody. 'Cause I'm not a fuckin' nurse. Sun, come on. Well, I gotta get back to the mall and pick up some shit for my big new nursing job. I'll probably get some pretty nice pills if I was a nurse. I was thinking we'd go get your picture taken. You wanna do that? That way we'll always see what you looked like right before you turned eight. Thank you. Sorry about the mess. So... this is Sunny, huh? Hey there, cutie. Just let me move this. Okay. You wanna have a seat up here? Up. All right. Ah, oh. Ohh! There we go. Okay. Like it? Yeah. Looks great. - You wanna get in there? - Oh, no, it's okay. It's not like I'm gonna charge you, Angela. Ah. All right. Do one, me and you? Think of something that makes you both happy. - You want one of just you? - Oh, God, no. No. Sunny, there's some, uh, toys out there. Do you wanna play outside while we finish up? You know, it's nice, what you got... you two. Yeah. My sister tried to adopt a girl. Turned out it wasn't even the agency's to give. Louise paid $20,000 for her. Jesus. They still never seen the kid. It was all in China, so it was a real mess. Finally just gave up. I'm sorry. So you like it here better? - You like taking pictures? - Oh. It is a dream come true. Hey, Sunny's got a birthday party tomorrow. You... You should come by. Of course, I still gotta get stuff for it. I could bring some coleslaw or something. Yeah. Hey, Sun, you ready to go? Come on. Hey, you know, my sister is visiting. Uh, she's gonna come by if you wanna meet her. Oh, yeah, we should go. It's late for her. Uh, could I keep one of the wallets? I mean, I won't take one of your copies. I'll make a copy. No, I... I don't need them all. You ready to go? Wanna say good-bye to Max? Good-bye, Max. Okay. Thank you. Listen. I gotta run a quick errand. You wait here for me for a sec? - Can I have some gum? - Honey, I don't have any gum. Can I go buy some gum? All right. Here. But just gum, all right? We meet back on this bench. I don't wanna have to go looking for you. So two minutes, okay? Okay. - Can I help you? - Uh, yeah. What's, like, the cheapest I could get in on a cell phone? The pay-as-you-go phone would be the least expensive. This one. Great. - Um, do I get my own number with this? - Of course. The phone plus the first Thank you. Hey. Come on. All right, go get in. I gotta make a call. You got a cell phone? Can I get one? You can see it in a minute. Just go... go get in. I know. Listen. If you get me two grand, I won't come after any of it anymore, okay? I told you already. I'm gonna invest it. Well, I don't got an account, so you gotta wire it. No, I'll pick it up. Well, you can call her then. All right? But don't call this number though. Call... Call us at home. Are we headed to the car wash? Yeah. - It's got games on it! - Yeah, just... Don't... I just got the thing. You can play with it later, all right? It wouldn't have games on it if you weren't supposed to play 'em. Just don't break it, all right? Mm-hmm. - All right, who has the ticket? - Me! All right, what's the number? Four, seven, two...

Um, I mean, doesn't somebody gotta, like, show me around or something first? Uh... Yeah, no... No, I can meet her. No, I actually know that building. Um... Yeah, no, I know it. It's where...

I'll go check. You need a sitter? Oh, I was looking for your sister. She moved out. Oh, okay. I didn't know that. I'll watch your kid. I've watched my cousins. So, you know... - I think I gotta find a girl. - Really, I can do it. Just if Sunny wanted to get at you, and she said... You know, I don't know. Just... You're a boy. I don't think it's gonna work out. I'm sorry. Get under the covers? Good. All right. Good night, sweetheart. Hi. I need a cab at the corner of Trop and Eastern. Listen, can you stop by the check-cashing place up on Trop... and just give me a minute? It's 24 hours. I'll be right out. Hi. I'm-I'm picking up a wire. Jerome. You would like that in money order?

I'm happy to watch her for an afternoon if you need it. Sure. Maybe even tomorrow if you'd like. I mean, we're only here for another day or two. And, uh... You know, I could... I could do more reading exercises with her. Yeah, she usually goes to this after-school thing until I get off work. Well, I could pick her up, or we could do it here. I mean, we're staying at a hotel... You don't have to pick her up. I can't pay you. Oh. No. God, I wouldn't... You wanna do that? Sun? You wanna meet Louise to do some reading? Sure.

Uh, I don't have the time for this right now. I gotta go to work. - You work at night? - It's a new thing. It's not all night. Is someone else in the house? What do you mean? Is there someone else here to watch her while you're away? Yeah, somebody's comin'. When? I had a sitter, and I just put her to bed, all right? She's fine. She's... It's a couple nights a week, all right? We got a big dog. See, I can't leave here knowing you'll be gone. It's endangerment. Look, we can take her. We can take her. There's a children's room down there. I'm not supposed to, but... You can come pick her up when you're finished. She's not gonna get any... She's not gonna get any sleep. Sunny. Hey. Sunny, come on. Wake up, sweetie. You gotta go with these guys for a few minutes. - Okay? - Why? Cause', um... Come on. Sit up. 'Cause I gotta go out, and you can't be here on your own. Let me see... see your foot. Okay? - I've, uh... I know. - The tongue's wrong. Okay. I'll fix it. Here, take your blanket. Let's put your coat on. Okay. Go with this officer. Thank you. You're here kind of early. Hi. Uh, you're here early. I know. I was, um, just trying something out. I was looking for something part-time. Um... We missed you yesterday. You're staying home from work, but you're coming in for this? I know. I meant to call. It was my kid... You should get home. I know. I'm... I'm about to go home soon. - See you soon. - Yeah. Hey, Sun. Where did you go? I was just trying something out. It was really bright in there. Well, we're both gonna sleep soon. I know your father's not around, and... I know you'll never get that back. But I'm just me, and, uh... Good morning. How's the new program coming? It's really a lot easier for me to just use the big book. Yeah. Well, we all gotta be on board on this one, okay? Right? Yeah. Did you, uh... Did you manage to get enough sleep? Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Um, listen. You know, today's the day that... uh... Right. Listen. I, um... I had it wired to me, so I could get you cash. It doesn't have to be cash, Angela. No. Well, my kid had a party, and there were a lot of new people at the house, and, uh... I... Somebody... I don't know. We can't find it. - And, uh, somebody must've stole it. - You don't have it? Well, I'm still trying somethin' else. Why didn't you tell me this sooner? I had it. You know, let's meet in my office in an hour. Don't... Don't you have other people? Come to my office in an hour. - Everything all right? - Did you see my white bag at Sunny's birthday party? - No. - It had all my back child support in it. - It's gone. - You should call the police. I called the fuckin' police. They can't do anything. - What about that kid upstairs? - What about him? I'm sorry, Angela. God. Listen, um, Louise really enjoyed meeting you. Uh... Thanks for letting her teach some today. She misses it. She fell for your little girl. Maybe they could, uh... Maybe Sunny could visit 'em sometime. Looks like Ted wants to see you. Fine. Thanks. I thought you said an hour. You know what? In the end, it is just completely inappropriate... that you're cleaning up this place while you are an employee of the company. I was just trying somethin' out. I don't... I probably... I don't have to do that. It's like a couple nights a week. Don't you think you should get something that pays better? A little more steady, so you're not spread so thin? Especially with your kid. - Yeah. - Yeah. I mean, we all have to be with this program right now. This is a custom database, and it just isn't gonna work if we're not all doing our part. Yeah. So, with you cleaning up while you're working, it's just all too... You know. Yeah. So look, just, you know, finish up your calls today. You can leave early if you want to. And, um, take this. Like a severance. Hello? Max? I gave you this number? No. No, I'm not coming in. That's it. It's 'cause that's the end of my time there. Uh, 'cause, uh... Yeah, I don't know why. Yeah? Like what? No. No, I don't wanna meet Louise for dinner, no. They... They have a good time? Did... Did Louise have a nice time today with Sunny? 'Cause I haven't been home yet. - You can drive, right? - Mmm. You didn't see my white bag at Sunny's party, did you? No. All right, listen. Wanna make a hundred bucks? All I want you to do is take my car out of town. - Just stick it someplace. - Where? Lake Mead, maybe. Just hide it. Do you wanna do it or not? - Your car that tan LeSabre? - Yeah. You gotta pay me now though. All right. Here. You can't tell anybody about this, and you gotta keep it clean... because I'm gonna report it and I'm gonna get some insurance out of this. Whoa, whoa. I'm not gonna steal your car, Angela. I don't want you to steal it. I want you to take it and stick it somewhere. What if you report it and I'm still driving it? Well, I don't know, you know? I'll wait for you, you know? You could call me. Nah, nah. Fuck it. It's too late now anyway. What the fuck is this now? - We didn't feed Casey. - You didn't feed him, you mean. You didn't feed Casey! So what'd you guys do? Couldn't clean all this up? It just happened. We can't keep this dog like this. Are you gonna help out or what? Oh, God. What happened? Uh... Shut it, Case. Jesus. The dog just got to the couch. Oh, I'm sorry. That's terrible. - Hello again, Sunny. - Hi, Louise. - Can I... What? - Hi. Um... Oh, um, Sunny and I had a wonderful afternoon. And I just wanted to make sure that... Um... C- Can we talk outside? I... I would love to see you two again, and I... I wanted to make sure... that you were planning to visit. I mean, I'm inviting you to visit. It-It would be like a long vacation. Um, I have an extra room, and I know a wonderful children's therapist. I, myself, was a schoolteacher, and... Sunny needs something more than she's getting. Uh, okay. I mean, Max knows where you guys are, so, uh, I'll talk to him about it later. Well, if you tell me when, I could send tickets. Okay. I'll talk to Max. And I gotta see what kind of vacation time I got. It's hard for me to get away from work. Well, maybe just Sunny then. And you could come visit later. I could enroll her in this great intensive children's program for reading. She's getting better. And it's really far for her, you know? - Yeah, but... - Okay. I can't talk right now. There's been a robbery or somethin' here. And I mean... Thank you for watching her today. Thank you. I appreciate it. I really enjoyed meeting you and your husband. You seem like nice people. All right? Thank you. Sunny. Turn that off. Honey? Go get Casey's leash and get your shoes on. Yo! Go put Casey in the car. - I still need the car. - When you get back. Look, the best thing you can do is just forget I ever asked. You're a good kid. Where are we going? Just give me a minute, okay? Come on. Go take him out, sweetie. Go ahead. Just go and take him out and tell him to sit, and then come back inside. Honey, look. We're gonna let Casey go to a new home. Where? I don't know where, but somebody will take him. Okay? We can't. I know you don't understand right now, but you will. All right, listen. I know it's hard right now. But... It's just hard right now. That's all. So are you gonna help me or what? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come here. Listen, Casey, sit. Come on. Come here. Come here, buddy. Come here. Sit. Sit. Sit, buddy. Come on. You're a good dog. - Sunny? - Casey! - Sunny, shut the door! - Casey, come here! - Sunny! Close the door. - Casey! - Sunny, shut the goddamn door! - Casey! He's gonna be okay. I need some help too! We're gonna meet Max for some Chinese food. Won't that be good? Huh? He's gonna treat us, so you can get whatever you want. Do you wanna go eat? Come on. Hmm? All right. You can stay in the car alone if that's what you want. Hmm. - Hey, you two. - Hey. I hope it's okay. I ordered you something. I didn't know. - I wasn't sure. - Yeah, yeah. No, that's fine. That's good. Here. What is this? Chicken? Come here, honey. Make yourself a plate. Fuckin' believe this? What the hell happened? Were you sleeping with him? No. No. It was the money. I had... It's not important. - You want me to talk to him? - And say what? I lost my other job. You know, Louise and Adam are going back tomorrow. I mean, she refused to leave before I talked to you. Yeah, yeah. I've seen her. We talked already. No, they, uh... they wanna give you some money. Some real money. Can we, um... Can we talk for a second, you and me? Hey. Hey, Sunny. You wanna go check out the desserts for a minute? Okay? Please? It's their adoption money, Angela. There's $20,000, and it's yours. They wanna help Sunny. What? No, I mean... I don't believe it. I mean, uh... That would really help. Um... What, do they just have a lot of money or something? They wanna help her as a family. They wanna help her with who they know, where they are. Where are they? I mean, you'd still be able to see her and everything. But they'd wanna take care of her, and you're just... you're just you. Now, without a job and... - What? - She wanted me to really talk to you about this. See if we could work something out. It'd have to be clear-cut. They can't go through another mess. That's crazy. Hey, Sunny? Sunny, come on back, honey. It's okay. Think about it. You know what? I'm not gonna think about it. It's not even legal. What's legal? You're gonna pay for all this, right? I don't think you can smoke in here. I could give a shit. - Call me. - Jesus. - I'll call you. - Sweetheart, come on. We gotta go. I didn't even eat anything! Louise is a nice person. All right? I'm just trying to help you both. Hey, can we get a, uh... a to-go thingy over here, please? Come on. Would you be careful, please! Didn't we get you shoes already? You're gonna kill yourself in these. - Do you know a place? - They're all closed. They're not all closed! All right, here. Here's a nice place. We're gonna get you some things here. Hey, honey, you want a little tiger toy? You need undies? Hmm? - All right. What about the sneakers? - They don't have any. - What are you talking about? They got big bins back here. - Not kids. Excuse me. Do you have any sneakers? Kids' sneakers? S. Aqu. Yeah, no, I saw. But I only saw slippers and like big men's shoes. I need kids' sneakers, for a little girl. No se. No, you don't know or no, you don't have any? Lo siento. Her goddamn shoes are falling off her feet. You want her to go barefoot? Can you try a little bit harder maybe with some fucking English! I'm sorry. What do you wanna do? I wanna go find Casey. Honey, I don't even know where to look. I... think it was somewhere here. Casey! Come here, boy! He'll be better off, okay? Sunny. Come on. - Casey! - Get in the car right now. Or I'm gonna leave without you. Come on. Here, honey. Will you go in and get like a travel toothbrush or something? For me, or for you? Uh, why don't you get us both one, okay? I got some toothpaste too. Good. You know, Louise likes you a lot. Just even after meeting you a few times. She knows about how your dad's not really around... and how... you need school help. She's nice. She is nice. How would you feel about letting them help you out for a little while? Up where they live. For me. Okay. Okay. Sunny. You stay in the car a sec, okay? Can I play on the phone? Uh, I need the phone for a minute, but you can play with it after. Hey. Um, why don't we talk more about, uh, helping her? Yeah, I mean, she said she would, but she doesn't know what it means. It's not Canadian money, is it? No, I don't care if they come. I just don't want to see them. I don't know. I'm not going home. That's for sure. Look, I'll go to a motel and I'll call you. Back in a second, okay? Hey, baby, we got a room. You wanna... You wanna go on up? I'll meet you up there in a second? Okay? Here. It's Room 220. Give me the phone back, okay? Yeah, I'm at the Ponderosa. It's past Decatur. It's Room 220. You gotta give me some time though. I don't know. Um... You know what? Just... Just come. What's this, a movie? Did you press something we're gonna have to pay extra for? No. Geez! Why don't you go wash your face? Why? Just go wash up a little while we're here, you know? He's out. It's pretty late, Anna. - He'll be here in a minute. - Will he? Yes, he will. - Where's Louise and them? - You said you didn't want to see her. - I know, but where are they? - They're in the car. You want me to come in? No. They give you the money? Yeah. You gettin' something out of all this? - Listen, I'm not doing it here. - Wait a minute. You said... - You said to meet here. - I know, but I can't do it here. I'm... All right. I'm gonna go get Sunny, and you guys... you guys just pull up. Pull up to the side up a ways. And you follow me, yeah? How do I know you won't just take off? I won't. Whatever you want. Come on, baby. They're here. Let's go. Sunny, come on. Get your coat. Let's go. Hey. Here. So, listen, they, uh... Louise is gonna take you up to Canada for a while. And... that's where you'll be taught better and everything. I've never been, so, uh... What about my clothes? They're gonna have new things for you. Toys. Books and... A little vacation. You know? Come on. Come outta the car, okay? Let's go see Max. Hey there, cutie. She'll be okay. Help me out a little, huh? I'm gonna see you soon. I'll come up and see how you're getting on up there. You can call me whenever you want. Okay? Here. I'll give you the phone, like you wanted. You want that? Go on with Max. Go ahead with Max. Don't be difficult, Sunny. Louise is with him. You guys drivin' up? I don't know. Doesn't she need papers or somethin'? They got all that. All right. Huh? Go on ahead, okay? I'll see you soon! Hey. Think of me. Shit. It's, uh... It's fine. I'll, uh... I'll get it goin'. It just needs a minute. I can call someone. I'll get it started. Just go. Okay. Come on. The car got wet. It got wet. It won't start. Oh, God, come here. Come here.
