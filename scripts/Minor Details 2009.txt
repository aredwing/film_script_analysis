It Is A Bulletin Board, You Know. But Read It. ''Cheerleaders Are Ick, And They're Going To Get Sick. Signed, A Friend.'' What Does It Mean? What Do You Mean, ''What Does It Mean''? It's Just A Dumb Note. So, You Don't Think It's Real? Claire, You Read Too Many Mystery Stories. It's Probably Just Emily. She Loves To Pull Pranks On Everybody. She's Annoying, But She's Completely Harmless. Coach: Nice Job, Girls! Very Nice! Are You Okay, Coach Hallows? Me? I'm Fine. Why? Never Mind. Yeah, Just. . . ''Go Danforth''! Hey, Um, Taylor, I Can Tell You've Been Working On Your Routine. Nice. -Coach: Keep It Up! Keep It Up! -Taylor: Okay, Thanks. I Will. [ Mocking ] ''Okay, Coach Hallo. Whatever You Say, Coach Hallows.'' Coach Really Likes You, Taylor. Really? You Think So? Yeah. I Saw Her Watching You A Lot. How Can You Tell Who She's Watc? She's Half Blind. Anyway, She Always Feels Sorry For The Underdog. -Woof, Woof! -You're Just Jealous. [ Scoffs ] Oh, Please! You Do Know My Father Made A Sizable Donation To The Academy This Year, Don't You?

I'm Sure The Coach Didn't Even Notice When You. . . Fell. Do You Really Think So? Yeah. They Were Much Too Busy Watching Riley's Cradle Catch To See What The Rest Of Us Were Doing. That Was Amazing. I Know. I Saw It. Maybe Riley Won't Make It This Year. You Never Know. Miracles Do Happen. Only In Movies. Are You Okay, Vanessa? Oh, I Don't Feel So Good. I Think I'm Gonna. . . Hey, Wait For Me!

Where Did You Get It? We Found It On The Bulletin Boa. We Thought It Was Some Kind Of Joke. Emily Pulling A Prank Or Something. -Maybe It's A Coincidence. -That's What I Said. Paige: Or Maybe Some Type Of Food Poisoning. Taylor: No. Think About It. We All Ate Dinner In The Cafete, And Only The Cheerleaders Got Sick.

I Knew She Liked Him. Looks Like The Feeling's Mutual. -Same With Brad. -Whatever. Let's Just Get Out Of Here. I Mean, I Have To Go Wash Lab Ds For Professor Plume Anyway. Do You Want To Come Help Me? Do I Have A Choice? Not Really. Ethan: What Are You Guys Doing? Abby, You're Getting Your Clothes All Dirty. That's So Not You. [ Sighs ] You're Going To Need This. Hey.

I'll Eat Them Later. What Looks Healthy? It's A Snack Machine, Paige. I Know. I'm Just Worried That The Food In The Cafeteria Is Contaminated, And I Don't Want To Take That Chance. Y'all Better Clean Up This Trash. But We Didn't Make This Mess. I Don't Care. Pick It Up. It's Not My Job To Clean Up After Y'all. So, What "Is" His Job? [ Both Laugh ] Coach: All Right.

Not After Your Lips Have Been On It. -You Really Should Take It, Abb. -No. Suit Yourself. Paige: That Stuff Really Works. I Don't Feel Sick Anymore. I Officially Call This Meeting To Order. Don't. . . Please. My Head Stil. It's Not A Gavel. Doesn't Matter. Okay, Here's What We Know: We Have Two Notes Targeting Two Different Groups, And Everybody Gets Sick. Tell Us Something We Don't Know. You Know, I Don't Feel So Good. I'm Gonna Go Back To My Room. Why Are You Being So Rude? I'm Not. Yeah, You Are. Okay. Sorry. Don't Tell Us. Tell Paige. [ Clears Throat ] Abby: Paige. . . Look, I'm Really Sorry. You Were Right, And I Was. . . I Was Wrong. Something's Up, And If We Work Together, We Can Figure Out Who's Doing It. Okay. And If You And Ethan Are A Coup, Then I Can Deal With It. What? You And Ethan. Huh? We Saw You And Claire Under The Tree Today With Brad And Ethan. Ethan Was Just Being Friendly. Wait, So You And Ethan And Brad And Claire Aren't. . .? Well. . . No, I'm Just Kidding. Anyways, I Think He Likes You. You Do? Why Do You Think That? Wouldn't You Like To Know! [ Gasps ] Yeah! Tell Me! [ Paige Laughs ] Paige! Come On! Stop! Tell Me! Please? Wait! Paige, You Have To Tell Me! Tell You What? Nothing. So, You Guys Are Good? Yeah. Yeah. [ Sighs ] Okay, Let's Get Back To Business. Somebody's Making Everybody Sick, And We Have To Figure Out Who, Why, And How They're Doing It. Whoever's Doing This Is Doing It For A Reason. They're Getting Something Out Of It. It's Not Just Random. What Does Anybody Have To Gain By Making Everybody Sick? I Don't Know. . . Yet. Let's List The Possible Suspects And Their Motives. You First. [ Sighs ] Okay. Sean. Sean? Our Cute, Nerdy Sean? -Mm-Hmm. -No Way. Come On. Think About It. It Makes Sense. He's Always Getting Sick, And Everyone's Always Making Fun Of Him For It. Maybe He Just Wants To Even The Score, Show Everyone Else How It Feels. Okay, Sean. Motive, Equality. What About Ethan? It's Not Ethan. Taylor: Why Not? It Just Isn't. That's Why. What About Brad? He Didn't Get Sick. -It's Not Brad. -Why Not? It Just Isn't. That's Why. Okay. Not Brad. Emily Littman? Yeah. She's Always Wanting To Be With The Older Kids. And She's The Queen Of Pranks. Sean, Emily. . . Anybody Else? Professor Plume? No Way! That Last Note Was On His Whiteboard. And He Always Freaks Out If We Have To Leave The Class Early For Any Club Activities. Last Year When We Had The State Soccer Finals, He Gave Me A D Because I Turned In My Assignment Late. Was It My Fault That My Team Ned Me To Help Win The Championship? Yeah, You're Right. He Has Motive And Opportunity. He Could Easily Come Up With Some Nasty Potion To Make The Whole School Sick. Uh, Nurse Betty? Are You Kidding? She Was So Tired Last Night, I Had To Program All Of Her Shos On Dvr. It Took Me Hours. Okay. Sean, Emily, Plume. . . Anybody Else? What About Riley Or Mia? They're Nasty Enough To Do Something Like This. No. They Got Sick, Too, And They Barfed All Over Their New Outfits. They Were Devastated. I Would Be, Too. Okay. Let's Start At The Top Of The List. Tomorrow, Sean's Room. [ School Bell Rings ] [ School Bell Rings ] All Right. Where Are The Students? Where Are The Students? [ Coins Clink ] Student: This Is Ridiculous! I've Been Waiting In This Line A Half Hour. There'd Better Be Something Left When We Get To The Machine. Someone Is Making A Lot Of Money Off Of These Machines. I'm Broke. You Want To Loan Me A Dollar? Or Two? Sorry. I Only Have A Dollar, And I'm Starving To Death. I Have A Dollar You Can Use. Thank You. It's A Loan. That Means You Pay It Back With Interest. What Kind Of Interest? I'll Think Of Something. Okay, Here's The Plan. Claire, You Keep Sean Occupied While We Search His Room. Why Me? Because You Two Have So Much In Common. You Love Books, And He Loves Books. You Love. . . Books, And He Loves Books. Okay, Okay, I Get It. I'm A Nerd. No. She Didn't Mean It Like Tha. Really. But Isn't Searching His Room A Violation Of His First Amendment Rights? Making People Puke Their Guts Ot Has To Be A Violation Of Something, So It Has To Be Done. All Right. I'll Text Abby's Phoe Once It's All Clear. Okay? Okay. Hey, Sean, Look What My Mom Sent Me In The Mail Today. Wow! Can I Borrow This When You're Done With It? Well, I Was Thinking, How About We Read It Together, Sort Of Like A Book Club. You Know, You Read The First Ch, And Then Give It To Me, And I Read It And So On, And Then We Can Compare Notes. Really? That Would Be Awesome! When Can We Start? Uh, How About Right Now? I Just Have To Go And Text My Mm And Tell Her Thank You, So You Just Stay Right Here, Don't Move, And I'll Be Back In A Minute. Okay. [ Cell Phone Vibrates ] All Clear. Paige: Ew! Smell These. Pass. Okay, Anything In Here, Besides Socks, That Could Make Somebody Sick? No. These All Look Safe. We're Never Going To Find Anything In Here. [ Noises Outside ] Someone's Coming. Calamine! I Need Calamine! Abby: We've Got To Get Out Of Here. Did You Guys See That Stuff All Over His Face? It Was So Gross. Question. . . Why Are You In My Room? Uh, Answer. . . Room Inspection! -Yeah. -Yeah. Oh, Dust. Dirty Laundry. Pills? Those Are Prescriptions. Taylor: Sure, Sure. All Right. We'll Let It Go This, But You've Been Warned. Random Room Inspections Are Imminent And Increasing Daily. Our Work Here Is Done. [ Whispering ] Breathe, Baby, Breathe! Abby, Taylor, Paige, Detention. I Thought You Said You Were Going To Keep Sean Occupied. He Found Us In His Room. I Am So Sorry. By The Way, What Did You Do To ? He Was Covered In Hives. Claire: Right After I Texted Yo, I Turned Around, And He Was Gone. Maybe He Had A Reaction To Some Plant Or Something. I Ran Inside To Tell You, But Principal Littman Pulled Me In Her Office. Why? She's Freaking Out About All This Sickness. She's Getting Tons Of Phone Cals From Concerned Parents. Some Of Them Are Going To Pull Their Kids Out Of School. Maybe We Should Tell Her About The Notes. No, Not Yet. Let's Try And Solve This On Our Own. What If She Figures Out We Knew Something And Didn't Tell Her? She'd Be Really Mad. Maybe She Would Expel Us. No Way. Our Parents Spend A Fortune On This School. I Mean, We Basically Pay Her Salary. Don't Worry. Let's Wait A Couple Of Days, And If We Don't Find Out Who It, Then We'll Tell Her. So, Did You Guys Find Anything? Just Some Dirty Socks. Oh. Abby: What If We Get Caught? Claire: It's An Emergency. I'm Starving. Abby: I'm Not Eating Anything From The School. Taylor: The Coast Is Clear. Aren't You On A Fresh-Fruit Diet? That Was Then. This Is Now. I'm So Hungry, I Could Eat A Whole Cow. Lucky They Don't Serve A Whole Cow Here. -Come On. I'm Starving. -Me Too. What's That. . .? Guys, Get Down! What's Wrong? I Think Someone's Following Us. Huh? Not So Loud! What Are You Talking About? Claire: Interesting. What? If Someone Is Following Us, We're Going To Find Out Who And Why. Come On. Wait! What If They're Dangerous? Somehow, I Don't Think So. Ethan? Sean? No Way. Claire: Brad? Why Were You Guys Following Us? Because You're Acting All Suspicious. We Just Wanted Some Good Food. What's Wrong With That? You Raided My Room. Why? Room Inspection. You Think I Fell For That? I'm Not A Complete Moron. Maybe We Should Tell Them. Girls: No! Ethan: Tell Us What? Okay, But We Have To Swear You To Secrecy. That Means You Won't Tell Anybody. No, Really? Someone's Trying To Make All The Students Sick. We Found These Notes. No Way. Really? Cool! But It's Not Me. Yeah, We Know That. . . Now. So What Are We Gonna Do? We Are Going To Figure Out Who's Doing This. You Guys Could Help By Not Following Us And Letting Us Do Our Own Thing. Claire: And Not Interfering And By Not Saying A Word About These Notes To Anyone. Got It, Brad? Me? Yeah. Yeah, Whatever. Promise? Yeah. Okay. Let's Eat. Oh, And, Sean, You Might Want To Try Fragrancee Calamine Lotion From Now On. We Could Smell You A Mile Away. Man, I Told You That Stuff Stinks. Do You Think The Boys Will Tell? They Better Not. If Anyone Finds Out That Someons Making Everyone Sick, The Whole School Will Freak Out. [ Sighs ] Are You Sure We Should Be Doing This? If You Don't Want To, It's No Skin Off My Nose. Okay. Dang, This Machine Is Almost Out Of Squiggles, And I Love Squiggles. Me Too. Here, Put These In Your Bag Until After Drama Class. There's No Way I Can Give My Monologue With Those In My Teeth. [ Laughs ] Girl 1 : Check This Out. Girl 2: Oh, My Gosh! Who Do You Think Put It Here? Mia: What Is It? Read It. It's Freaky. ''Don't Want To Barf? Stay Away From The Carf.'' ''Carf'? ''Carf'? Kind Of Sounds Like ''Cafeteria.'' Oh, My Gosh. Do You Really Think Someone's Trying To Poison Our Food? Looks Like It. But Why? Check It Out, Guys. Wasn't A Virus After All. Someone's Deliberately Trying To Poison Our Food. Let Me See That. Hey, What's Going On? Mia: A Note's Been Put By The Drama-Room Door. What'd It Say? Someone's Poisoning The Cafeteria Food. They're Trying To Make Everyone Sick. Who Would Do Something Like That? A Real Jerk, That's Who. You Know, I Bet It Was One Of Emily's Pranks. Yeah. That's It. Why Are You Looking So Guilty, Brad? Me? I'm Not. Riley: Yeah. Hey, Aren't You One Of The Only Students Who Didn't Get Sick? So? I Have A Strong Stomach Lining. I Get It From My Grandpa's Side Of The Family. Are You Trying To Pin The Blame On Me? For All We Know, You Put The Note Up. I Got Sick, Remember? And I Helped Nurse Betty With The Other Sick Kids, And I Helped Her Mop Up Her Office. Yeah, Brad. I Didn't Do It. Honest. [ School Bell Rings ] Excuse Me, Please. I Need To See That Note. Do You Really Think Someone's Trying To Poison Us? I'm Going To Call My Parents. I Want To Go Home. This Is Just Somebody's Idea Of A Little Joke. We Have A Virus Going Around, And That's All. Now, Off To Class, And Get Rid Of That. For Evidence. This Is The Last Time I'm Helping You With The Lab Dishes. It's Really Gross, I Know. I'm Sorry. But I Really Need The Extra Credit. I'm Worried About My Last Homework Assignment, But I'll Make It Up To You, I Promise. Professor Plume: I'm Still Working On It. Just Another Day Or So, And My Mission Will Be Accomplished. The Students? Oh, No. They Don't Suspect A Thing. Why Would They? About Certain Things They Can Be A Bit Clueless. [ Door Squeaks ] Oh! I'll Call You Back! Why Were You Listening To My Conversation? Oh. We Weren't. We Just Came In To Clean Lab Dishes. Professor Plume: Oh. Did You Hear Anything That I Said? Live. Please Live. Taylor: He's Watching Us. Paige: I Know. He Knows We Know. I Know. You Know, I Never Thought I'd Say It, But I'm Actually Getting Reallyk Of Candy Bars. Not Me. I Could Eat Them Forever. It's Professor Plume, Just Like We Thought It Was! Yeah! And He Knows We Know. What? We Heard Him Talking On His Phoe About Some Big Plans And How None Of The Students Knew And How In A Few Days His Mission Would Be Accomplished. What Mission? I Don't Know, But You Should Have Seen The Look On His Face. It Was Evil. So, What Are We Going To Do? There's Only One Thing We Can Do. What's That? We'll Tell Him That The Gig Is Up, And We'll Call The Police If He Doesn't Confess. Yeah, And Then He'll Murder Us And Turn Us Into That Green Glop He Has In His Classroom. What If That Green Glop Is The Juice Of Former Students? Oh, Gross! All Right, We Have Two Choices: We Tell The Principal, Or We Confront Plume. She'll Never Believe Us. Okay, Then, We'll Confront Plume. After Chemistry, Agreed? Agreed. Agreed. But You Guys Are Doing The Talking. Okay. Riley. Yes, Sir. I Am Pleased To Announce That You Are The Only Student Who Received An A On Last Week's Homework Assignment. Thank You, Professor Plume. I Tried Really Hard On That Homework Assignment. Bravo. I'm Dead Meat. How Did You Get An A? I Pulled A Few Strings. What Kind Of Strings? Ew! George? Professor Plume: Put Your Books Away, Please. Please Be Ready For An Announcement, A Very Important Announcement. I Had Hoped To Keep My Plans Secret For A Little While Longer, But I'm Afraid That's Now No Longer Possible. Now, With The Permission Of Principal Littman, I Have Submitted A Number Of Nas From The Students In This Class To Compete In The National Science Fair, And I Am Pleased To Announce Tht Those Students Have Been Accepted. Sean, Ethan, And Vanessa, George, Riley, And Paige. I Thought You Said You Were Doing Bad In This Class. Extra Credit Never Hurts. Nurse Betty, On Intercom: ^Ino! Not Again! Not Again! ^Isomebody! [ Moans ] Girl: I Can't Drink This. It Hurts My Stomach Too Much. I Think I'm Going To Die. You Think You're Going To Die? I Know I Am. Girl: Nurse Betty, I Need More Pepto. We're All Out. But I Need It Bad. I Sent Oscar Out To Get Some. Like That's Going To Help. Yeah, Last Time You Sent Oscar Out, He Didn't Come Back For Days. Then When He Finally Did Come Back, He Had Forgotten What You Had Sent Him Out For. I Want My Mom. Me Too. Me Three. Me. . . Four! [ School Bell Rings ] We've Been In This Line For A Long Time. Did You Hear The News That The Cafeteria's Poisoned? Let's Go. We Are Leaving Right Now. There Is No Way I'm Keeping You In This School. [ Students Hurling ] Please. Ten Students Left Danforth This Morning. Principal Littman Is Freaking Out. My Mom Wants To Pull Me Out, Too. She Can't Do That! I Won't Let Her. How Sweet! If You Leave, I Won't Have Anyone To Pick On! -Take It Back! -Okay! Okay! I Still Think It's Sean. Girls: It's Not Sean. Okay, Okay. It's Not Sean. Who's Next? Both: Emily. Wow. This Is Not What I Expected. You Just Never Really Know A Pen Until You Break Into Their Room. Well, Except For Sean. Yeah, That Was Exactly What We Expected. Let's Do This. Abby: Can't Find Anything. Taylor: Me Neither. I Wish Our Rooms Were This Nice. What Are You Guys Doing? This Is My Room. And You're Looking In My Room. No Way! You Think It's Me? I Can't Believe It! You Actually Think I'd Do Something Like That? Remember The Time You Put Flour And Sugar In My Shoes? And The Ants In My Bed? Paige: And The Molasses In My Conditioner Bottle? That Was You? Yeah. Sorry About That, But I'm Not Trying To Make Anyone Sick! Raise Your Right Hand. Do You Solemnly Promise That You Are Totally Innocent? Uh, Let's Rephrase That. Okay. Do You Solemnly Promise That You Didn't Write That Note? I Solemnly Promise! I Believe Her. You Do? Yeah. For One Thing, I Don't Think You're Smart Enouh To Pull Off Something This Big. Yes, I Am! And Another, I Don't Think Evenu Would Do Something This Low. Yes, I. . . No. I Really Wouldn't. To Say Sorry For Suspecting You, You Can Sit At Our Table For One Week. I Mean, Once We Figure Out Who's Contaminating The Cafeteria Food. Two Weeks. Don't Push It. Deal. ''Fly Fishing, My First Kiss, And Cabbage. Which Is The Most Graceful?'' [ Thud ] Paige: Who Threw It? Can You See Anybody? There's Nobody Out Here. What Does It Say? ''Stop Looking For Clues, Or You'll Be Singing The Blues!'' Let Me See It. That's Freaky. That Means Somebody Knows About Us. But The Only Other People Who Kw About The Notes Besides Us Are-- Ethan, Brad, And Sean. So, You Guys Think It's Them? They're The Ones Putting Up Thes And Making Everybody Sick? Paige: Who Else Could It Be? Everyone Thinks It's Salmonella Or Something. Maybe It's A Copycat Crime. Or It Was Them All Along. And They're Just Trying To Scare Us Off. It Wasn't Ethan! I Won't Believe It! There's Only One Way To Know For Sure. How? We Have To Watch Their Every Moe And Never Let Them Out Of Our Sight. I Can Do That. Why Do We Always Get Water Duty? I Guess We're Not The Coach's Pets. That's Because Paige And Abby Are. Coach: All Right. Good Job, Gir. Come On! Go, Go, Go, Go, Go! Kick The Ball Higher! [ Blows Whistle ] Goal! Nice Shot, Janice! [ Cheering ] Good Job. Good Job. Moving The Ball, Getting It In The Goal. That's Very Nice, Janice. You've Just Accomplished The Purpose Of Soccer. Everyone Knows. Follow Example. Uh, Coach Johnson, I Don't Feel So Good. Can I Go Back To The Dorm? Yes, Yes, Of Course. Paige, Will You Please Go With Her? Can I Go, Too? Uh, Yes. Get Out Of Here. Go. Very Nice Joining Us. Thank You Very Much. So Not Fair. [ Cell Phone Rings ] Hey, Dad! Yeah, The Vending Machines Are Almost Empty. Oh, Me? No, No, No. I'm Feeling Fine. Okay. Then I'll See You Tomorrow. Oh, And Could You Bring Some Exa Bags Of Squiggles For Me And Riley? Okay, Great. Thanks. Bye. -He's Bringing Extra Squiggles! -Yum! [ Tv Program Plays ] [ Snores ] [ Tv Program Continues ] [ Whispering ] What Are They Doing? Shh! [ Slam ] Nurse Betty: Sean, What Are You Doing Here? I, I Was Just. . . I Mean. . . Nurse Betty: Oh, You Poor Boy. Let's Just Give You An Allergy , And You'll Feel Better In No Time. Oh, It's Okay. It's Okay. Really. Uh, I'm Fine. No, Really, Really, Really Fine! [ Giggles ] Uh! Oh! It Was Quivering Just A Little Earlier, So I Thought I Had It. It's Time To Turn In The Lab Notes. Claire, Will You Pick Them Up And Bring Them Back To Me? You All Finished? Are You Sure You Want To Hand It In Like That? Why Not? I Don't Care About The Grades. What About Your Parents? They Don't Either, So Why Should I? Nice Work! I Have No Choice. My Dad Does Care. Ouch. Oh. Sorry. I Didn't Mean It Like That. That's Okay. [ School Bell Rings ] Class Dismissed! I Didn't Get The Jaws To Work This Time, But I'm Gonna -- -Student: Ow! -Sorry. If It Bleeds, See The School Nu. You Know Where She Is. Hey, Um, Can You Help Me For A Minute? Well, Sure. What's Up? It's Just You're Really Good At Science, And I'm Really Not. [ Chuckles ] Hey, Basketball Practice. Be There? -Yeah. -All Right. No, I. . . We Need You, Too. Professor Plume: The Next Time I Hope To Have It Be Able To Work. . . Hey, Guys! Hi, Seanie. [ Door Closes ] Okay, So, What's The Problem? Well, It's Like This. . . We Have A Problem, And Now So Do You. [ Scoffs ] I Don't Have A Problem. Me Neither. Here's Our Problem. We Know You Threw That Pinecone Into Our Room. I Thought You Said They Were Out Of The Room! I Thought They Were! [ Sighs ] Okay, So, It Was Us. Why? This Can Be So Messy At Times. Especially When It's Poured On Someone's Head. So Start Talking. What Were You Doing In Nurse Betty's Office? Claire: Yeah, And Why Did You Throw That Pinecone At Us? You've Got Two Seconds To Start Talking, Otherwise. . . I'm Probably Allergic To That Stuff. Claire: It Sure Will Be Fun To Find Out. Who Should We Glop First? Claire: Ethan. Okay, Okay. I'll Try To Explain. Just. . . Put The Glop Down. After You Guys Showed Us The Notes, We Thought It Might Be Fun To Figure Out Who Sent Them. Before You. Why? It's A Guy Thing. So, You Just Wanted To Beat Us At The Punch. That's It? And You Were Trying To Scare Us Off With That Note To Give You More Time To Solve The Mystery? Pretty Much. Tell Them The Rest Of The Story. There Is No Rest Of The Story. Abb Y: Oh, I Think There Is. And. . . We've Got All Night. I Need My Nighttime Meds Soon. Then You'd Better Start Talking. If I Don't Take Them Before I Go To Bed, I Might. . . [ Sighs ] I'm Sorry, Guys. I Just Can't Take The Chance. It's Too Embarrassing. -Shut Up, Sean. -Brad: I Mean It. If You Let Ethan And Brad Go, Then I Will Tell You Anything And Everything. I Swear! [ Whispering Indistinctly ] Okay. You're Free To Go. Okay, Sean, Spill Your Guts. Okay. So, Ethan And Brad Thought If They Solved The Mystery, Then You Would Be So Grateful To Them That You Might Let Them Take You To The End-Of-The-Term Dance. [ Gasps ] Really? Sean: Yeah. And What Would Sean Get Out Of This? Nothing Now, I Guess. [ Giggles ] I'm So Happy, I Could Cry. Save Your Tears. We Still Haven't Solved The Mystery Yet. And If The Boys Figure It Out Before We Do. . . It Will Be Totally Humiliating. But There's Still Gonna Be Some Fringe Benefits, Right? For You And Taylor, Maybe. Claire: You Guys, Let's Look At These. The Note From The Guys Was In Rhyme, But Some Of The Other Notes Don't Rhyme. So, What Does That Mean? I Wish I Knew. [ Cell Phone Blips ] Whoever's Doing This Is Running Scared. No One's Gotten Sick For A Couple Of Days. They're Just Laying Low. They'll Strike Again. You Wait And. . . What? Oh, My Gosh! I Know Who It Is! Now We Know Who The Rat Is. We Just Have To Set The Trap. [ Chuckles ] This Is Gonna Be Fun. [ Jingles Keys ] Where Did You Get Those? Uh, I Found Them. Isn't That Stealing? Chill Out, Okay? I'll Put Them Back Later. I Promise, Okay? Okay. Paige: How Long Is This Going To Take? Claire: Just Wait For The Signal. Come On. Let's Go! What If She's In There? Her Tv's On. She Never Turns It Off. She Says It Will Give Her 7 Years Of Bad Luck Or Something. Well, What If She Comes Back? She Won't. It's Friday -- Bingo Night. [ Tv Program Plays ] [ Beep ] [ Activates Intercom Microphone ] [ Recording Plays, Amplified ] : ^Iattention! Attention! ^Iwake Up! Wake Up! ^Ithis Is A Fire Drill! ^Iplease Go To The Closest Exit. ^Iplease Do It Now. See? Perfect. Why Didn't We Just Pull The Fire Alarm? Why Didn't I Think Of That? Claire: Operation Rat Trap Has Begun. Student: What's Going On? Is This A Drill? Hurry, We're Supposed To Meet Outside. Claire: The Dorm Should Be Empty. Let's Go. [ Door Squeaks ] If You Were A Rat, Where Would You Hide Something? I Would Hide Stuff Underneath My Bed. No, That's Too Obvious. Bingo! Paige: It's Locked! I Read About Someone Doing This In One Of My Mystery Books. Let's See If It Works. [ Lock Snaps ] It Works. Oh, My Gosh! We Have Our Proof. Well, Let's Tell The Principal. Not Just Yet. Emily: Weave, Girls, Weave! He Said ''Weave,'' Not ''Skip''! There We Go! Pick It Up! I Wish I Were A Teenager. All In Good Time, Emily. They Get To Have So Much Fun. Yes, But They Also Have A Lot More Responsibilities. Being 10 Really Bites! It Gets Worse. Trust Me. But They Get To Stay Up Late! Well, Yes, But They Also Have To Get Up Early. I Wish I Were Grown Up. Trust Me, Kiddo. It's Not All That It's Cracked Up To Be. Here, Let's Call Them In. [ Blows Whistle ] Come On In, Girls! Come, Sit Down. Sitting! Sitting! Sitting! Semicircle!

I've Been Watching You All Closely, And I'm Ready To Announce The Gs That Are Going To Start Next Week. [ Sighs ] Please Let It Be Us. If I Don't Make It, There's Going To Be Big Trouble. My Grandpa Pays A Lot Of Money To This School. Shh! Quiet Girls! You Know, On Second Thought, I've Decided To Wait Until You Are Not So Stinky To Tell You, So, Go, Unstinkify Yourself. [ Grumbling ] -Go On. -Go, Go, Go! I Know. I'm Very Cool Awesome. Oh, That Little Rat! Patience, Patience. Let The Rat Have The Cheese For Now. I'm Gonna Go Dump Those Out. You Guys Fill Up The New Ones, Okay? And Add A Little Surprise To One Of Them. Taylor: Okay, Hurry, Abby. I'm Gonna Get Some Help. Emily: Can I Tell The Girls? Piease? Well, I Usually Look Forward To This Thing Every Year, But, Uh, Let's Make A Deal. I'll Tell Them Who First String Is, And Then You Can Announce The Goalie, Okay? Okay, Deal. Who Is It? -Wow, Really? -Yeah, Yeah. Okay. All Right. Come On In, Girls. Come On In. Please Sit Down. Indian-Style Please. Thank You. Thank You. Very Good Job. Very Good Job. I'm Very Proud Of You. You've All Done Very Well This Week. And Now Our First String Is Tara, Riley, Molly, Claire, Mia, Ashley, Reagan, Bianca, Abby, And Janice. Good Job, Everyone. Good Job. And The Goalie Is. . . Paige! [ Laughs ] Coach, Can I Pass Out The Water Cups? Uh, Yeah, That's A Good Idea. Hydrate, Hydrate, Right? Emily: Hydrate, Hydrate! I'm. . . I'm Okay, Thanks. I Think You Should. Rules, You Know? Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate. No, Really. I Just Had A Drink Before I Took My Shower. Thanks, Though. Coach, Mia Won't Drink The Water, And You Know How Important Proper Hydration Is. It's A Rule, And All. Mia, I'm Very Surprised. Take A Cup Immediately. Abby: Enjoy. I'm Really Not Thirsty. Drink It, Mia. Coach: Okay, Now For The Fun Part. Who Wants Number One, Huh? Me! Okay, Riley, There You Go. All Right, Keep Catching 'Em! Coach: Good Job! -Coach. . . -Yes? I'm Not Feeling Well. Oh, Well, We'll Be Done Here In A Minute, Okay? No, Really. I Can't Wait. What's Wrong, Mia? Stomach Hurt? May I Be Excused, Please? -Mia, I-- -Coach, Mia Really Is Sick. Can We Take Her To The Restroom? I'll Take Her. She's My Best Friend! Maybe We Should All Go. You All Want To? Mia, Wait! [ Vomits ] Um, Are You Okay, Mia? She Will Be. . . In Time. You Guys Put Something In That Water! Is That So? I Bet You're Wondering Why We Didn't Get Sick This Time. I Don't Know What You're Talking About. Don't Play Dumb. You're The One That's Been Making Everyone Sick. She Is Not! Paige: Yes, She Is. Tell Her, Mia. Tell Her How You Made Everybody Sick. -Mia, What Are They Talking Abo? -I Have No Idea. I Would Listen If I Were You, Riley. Let Me Tell You How She Made Everyone Sick, Even You, Her Best Friend. Don't Listen To Them, Riley! I'm Going To Need An Explanation. I Had To Leave A Very Important Staff Meeting For This. Taylor Says She Knows How Everyone Got Sick. It Was Mia. It Was Not Me. Why Would She Do That? Besides, She Got Sick Twice Herself. Explain That, If You Can. She Was Faking. Making Accusations Like That Is Very Serious. I Hope You Girls Have Some Proof. Me Too. Oh, We Do. I'm Listening. The Other Day, I Was Collecting Lab Notes, And Mia's Writing Is So Perfect. She Puts This Little Squiggly On Her Letter A's. We Were Looking At The Notes In Our Room, And I Saw That Squiggle. Prove It! Anyone Could Copy My Squiggle. Not Me. True. Okay, You're Going To Need Some More Proof Than That. I Mean, She's Right, Anyone Could Copy Her Handwriti, Except Riley. What About This For Starters? Abby Said That The Person Who Was Doing This Must Have Been Getting Something From It. So I Remembered Something. Someone Is Making A Lot Of Money Off These Machines. Hey, Dad. So, We Figured Out That The Only Person Who Would Be Able To Gain Anything From This Was The Person Who Owned The Vending Machines, And I Did Some Checking Online, And All The Machines In The Schl Are Owned By Maxwell Enterprises, Your Dad. Everybody Was Eating Out Of The Vending Machines Because They Thought The Food In The Cafeteria Was Making Them Sick. So You And Your Family Were Making Money By Making Everyone Sick. Okay, So She Had A Motive, But How Did She Do It? How Did She Make Everyone Sick? Here's How. . . No Way. Is He All Right? And It Worked. Well, I Got To Go. Bye, Mom. What Happened? Little Brothers. Spare Me! What Did He Do? Yeah, What Did He Do? Is There An Echo In Here? Must Be. [ Sighs ] So What Really Happened? He Ate Some Berries Off A Bush Outside Our House. My Mom Gave Him Ipecac To Make Him Throw Up. Ricky Told Me All About It In Total Detail. Both: Gag! You Look Really Bad. I Know. You Put Ipecac In Everyone's Water To Make Them Think The Food In The Cafeteria Was Contaminated. And Then Your Dad Would Make Moy Off The Vending Machines, And You Would Get To Go To Modeling School This Summer. How Did You Know That? I Heard You And Riley Talking About It In Chemistry. [ Sighs ] Okay, So Even If You Guys Were Right -- Which You're Not -- How Would I Even Get This ''Iff' Or Whatever You Call It? Well, Remember This? Why Are You Looking So Guilty, Brad? For All We Know, You Put The Note Up. I Got Sick, Remember? And I Helped Nurse Betty With The Other Sick Kids. We Found This In Mia's Room. Nurse Betty Checked Her Supplies, And She's Missing A Couple Bottles Of Ipecac. Busted! Principal: Okay, This Is Terrible. -It Makes You Hurl. -Toss Your Cookies. Upchuck. Barfarooney. Okay, You Girls Can All Go Now. I Will Deal With Mia. Principal: You Can Go, Too, Riley. I Don't Believe She Did It. No Matter How Much Proof There Is. Thanks, Riley. You're The Best. [ Vomits ] Emm. . . You Did It! Huh? You're Head Cheerleader! -Me? -Yeah! Are You Serious? But What About Riley? What About Me? [ Scoffs ] [ All Chuckle ] You So Beat Her! Yeah! Let's Go! Eat It Up! Let's Go! Good For You! Eat It! No Fruit Today? No. No Fruit Today. Just A Pile Of Junk. I Mean, Good Stuff. I'm Celebrating. How About A Fat Boy? Thank You. Sergeant: Enjoy. Have You Decided What Dress You're Going To Buy Yet? Well, I Like That One, And I Like That One, So I Just Haven't Decided Yet. I Like That One. [ Sighs ] What's Up, Guys? Isn't He So Cute? Uh-Huh. No Way! This Is Too Good. You Could Start Right Here. I Want These Floors Spotless! -Because A Clean Kitchen-- -Is A Happy Kitchen! I Know! I Know! Taylor: Well, She Got What She Deserved. Yeah, Kitchen Duty Every Day And No Model Camp This Summer. Riley: Hi, Mia. I Can't Believe Riley's Still Friends With Her, After All Mia Did. Me Either. Riley: You Know, You Can Come Sit Down With Us When You're Done. Poor Baby. Well, All's Well That Ends Well. Everyone! Everyone! There's Another Note! It's On The Library Door! [ Indistinct Exclamations ] Student: I Do Not Want To Get Sick Again! I Hated That, Ugh! I Hate It When This Happens! People Are So Gullible. [ Laughs ] [ ''Secret Identity'' Plays ] One, Two, Three! One, Two, Three! One, Two, Three! Come On! Now, Life Was Better When You Were Here. More Trees, More Berries Again. Come Back! Come Back! [ Breathes Heavily ] [ Skunk Sprays ] Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I Did It! It's Back! It Lives! [ Cries ]
