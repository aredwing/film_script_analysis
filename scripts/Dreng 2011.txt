We'll think of you at work as we lie on the beach. Girls, come back to my place for some vodka. Come with me, Christian. I can't. You can go straight on to work. I must be getting home. See you. Take care. Have fun. See you. Do come! No, I need a bit of sleep. You can sleep with me. No... No. Forget I said so. OK. BOY Christian? Christian! Shall we mix the alcohol with some fresh air? - I'm asleep. - It's 8.30. I should've been at work at 8! I thought you had tabs on it. I've got breakfast ready. - No time for that. - You have to eat. - I start at 8. - Why did you take that job? - We could have enjoyed ourselves. - I need the money, right? For what? A flat. And my motorbike license. I'm not going to look after you if you end up in a wheelchair. So you say. - You don't pay rent here. - Mum! - I thought you were in a hurry? - Are you OK? Yes... It's probably just the bright light. Sure? - Phone me if you need me. - Run along. I'm fine. OK. See you later. Hello? - Are you eyeing me up or what? - No. I'm sorry I'm late. - Late for what? - I'm Christian from number 6. Are you John? - Yes? - I'm meant to be helping you. Oh, right, was it today? Get yourself a cup of coffee. Be right with you. - Let's swap places, all right? - Yes, of course. It'll be hard work. I hope they told you. Yes. They did. - Well, since they've hired you... - Thanks. - Coffee? - Please. You can start by sweeping up the broken bottle in the courtyard. Do you like it? It's delicious. That's nice to know. It's from a recipe I found. There should have been a bit of... ...coriander and ginger in it. But they're a bit much, I find. Yes. The janitor... - Isn't he a bit... - No, he's all right. - Can you talk to each other? - What do you mean? You don't have much in common. He spends the day in the yard. Yes. And you spend the day in an office. Not because I want to. If I could, I'd have chosen differently. Oh? I'd have gone to college. Like you. You could have done. - Finished? - Yes. It was too rich. I shouldn't have used cream instead of coconut milk. - Time for Teletubbies. - Teletubbies? Yes. Dipsy and Po. OK. I'll be a bit late in tomorrow. Can you manage? If anyone asks, say I've gone to the dump. Not that they will. - No, thanks. - A little one? Sure? - That's a luxury lunch box. - Mum likes doing them. She sounds like an OK lady. - Are you married? - No, I am not. I am not. Any children? Well... That's how it goes. I think I'll go to bed. I'm coming down with something. I'll go and read for a bit. - Hello? - Yes? - I'm looking for the janitor. - He's gone to the dump. - Do you know when he'll be back? - No. - Can I help you? - Can you install a washing machine? - Maybe. Where do you live? - 18. 9th floor. I just moved in. Hi. Hi. - My name's Sanne. - Christian. Shall we take a look? - What did you say it was? - A washing machine. Oh, yes. I don't think I can do it. We'd better wait till he gets back. Just to be on the safe side. I'll just have to turn my knickers inside out then. What? Oh, right! 'Bye! 'Bye. He's amazingly good at describing the way women's minds work. It got fabulous reviews. You really must read it. Christian? - Is something wrong? - Like what? - You seem so distracted. - I've got a bit of a headache. I think I'll go out for some fresh air. Can I get you anything from the shop? Chocolate? That's very kind of you, but no thanks. - I've got really fat lately. - You're not fat. - Don't you think so? - No. You look great. You don't think I look old and fat? See you soon. You're very early? - Coffee, even! - Thought I'd make a start. We'd better put something in our bellies first. Got to enjoy life, eh? - Custard or jam? - Either. No such thing. Custard or jam? - Custard, then. - OK. Right... "Louise, 20 years old". I don't understand... why they shave them all smooth like that. - 20 years old. You can have her. - Thanks. - Maybe you've already got one? - No. They cause nothing but trouble. Is it hard to install a washing machine? - Washing machines? - Somebody wanted some help. - It's not our job. - It'd only take a minute. - Who was it? - She's just moved into no 18. I'll pop by her later. - I could do it if you like. - Have you tried it before? - Not washing machines. - There's always a first time. Hi. That washing machine... If... - You said you didn't know how. - Maybe I do. Yes. I did it myself. OK. In that case... It's probably on the ground floor. Yes... but now you're here you could look at my toilet. It runs. Yes. Of course. - The toilet. - Yes. - Will you be all right on your own? - Fine. - I'm going to take a quick shower. - Yes. - I'll take care not to splash. - OK. I think I've fixed it. I saw you yesterday. - Oh? - You were watching me. - You mean in the basement? - No. Last night. From outside. You were looking up at me. I just wanted some fresh air. - Did you get any? - Any what? Fresh air? No. There isn't much fresh air in town. You are sweet, did you know that? I never thought about it. Well, you are. Really sweet. Thanks your help. Christian? Come here. Hold this. Not the surface. Like this. Amazing the things people chuck out. You look a bit knackered. I have a lot to get used to. Wiring, switches... Yes, it's not like school. Is it Teletubbies time? - Now? - Yes. Put hair on our chests. You've put your new shirt on. I knew it'd suit you. - Yes, it's good. - They sell some good stuff. Aren't you going to work? Or maybe it's for after work? You could tell be a bit about it, you know. You mustn't take any girl. You need one who's really nice. - Promise. - I promise. - Christian? - Yes? - Someone was asking for you. - Me? Who? The washing machine woman. Sanne. She's a looker. She says call her. OK. Hi. It's Christian. From the janitors. - You said call? - What are you doing? - I'm at work. In the yard. - I can see you. From up here. Hi! - Thanks for coming. - No problem. Do you fancy dropping by tonight? Yes... I suppose. - About 8.30? - Yes. That'd be fine. - See you, then. - OK... bye. - Well? - She asked me to pop up. - For what? - Probably to give her a hand. - When? - 8.30 tonight. OK... take a flower along. OK. - You're early. - Shall I come back later? Of course not! As you've just moved in... Do you like it? Can it be changed? No... Imagine! Bringing me a flower! - I have brought my tools too. - You are lovely. Haven't you ever had a girl before? Of course... I mean... not all the way... A virgin... - How sweet? - Sweet? Not that way. I could tell, though. - How? - It was over pretty quickly. You're ready again? You're a quick learner. You'd better go now. Oh? OK. - Hey... we'll see each other again. - Yes. Hey, Christian? I'm off to bed. - This early? - I've got work tomorrow. It was your choice. But being a janitor? It was all I could get. You could've tried harder. - Good night. - Good night, darling. - Sanne speaking. - It's Christian. How's things? - I've got a sore throat. - Try tea with honey and milk. Only if there's rum in it too. - Have you got any? - No. - Shall I bring you some? - That's be nice. OK. Now? - No, tonight. 9-ish? - I can come earlier than that. - No, 9 is best. OK. See you. Hello? Sanne? Hello? You are so lovely. Hi, darling. We won't be eating till late. Is that OK? - I'll just have a sandwich then. - Oh? - I have to be somewhere at 8.30. - I thought your friends were away. They are. A girl? No, not a girl. - A boy?! - No, don't worry! Oh? Well, you never know. Though it's easiest with a girl. - It is a girl, OK? - She could come for supper too. - Call her. - She wants my help with something. - Oh, OK. Another time, then. - Yes. What's got into you? If you've won the lottery remember your old mate John, OK? - Don't worry, I'm still broke. - Anybody'd think you were in love. - Are you in love?! - I don't know. - Is it that girl... - Sanne. Yes, she's hot. How did a little turd like you get into her pants? Amazing. Enjoy it while you can. Mummy, I'm hungry. Mummy, I'm hungry. Mummy! I am hungry. Sanne? He's hungry. - Hello, darling. - Mummy, I'm hungry. It's the middle of the night. You should be in bed. - Can I have some cornflakes? - A little bowl. With banana on? You little terror! It's the middle of the night! Come on. Hey, are you going? Why didn't you tell me you had a kid? Because... we've been too busy to talk. You could've mentioned it. It was so embarrassing. You can come for supper with us tomorrow. Ouch! Yep, George Best does it again! Whoops! - You call this work? - So this is mum? - Hello, I'm John. - Birgit. - He is really making an effort. - That's nice to hear. I hate that smell. Does he drink in working hours? - No, of course not. - How about asking her for supper? - That's nice of you but... - Phone her and ask. - I don't know... - Do try. I'd love to meet her. - It won't be tonight. - Yeah, yeah. 'Bye. - Does your mum know? - Yes. - Does she know who it is? - No. No need for that. OK. It's fine the way it is. - Hi. - Hi. - Is your mum in? - Yes. OK. May I come in? Mummy? - Why didn't you just come in? - I didn't know if it was OK. Of course it is. I'm full. Two more mouthfuls. Or you'll never be as big and strong as Christian. - He isn't big and strong. - Cheeky bugger! Feel! - I've got muscles too. - Let me feel. You certainly have. - Are you a grown up? - I think so. Are you as grown up as mummy? - Nearly. - How old are you? Eighteen. Mummy is 36. That's a lot more. It's not that much more. And 41 and 32 and 46. - And 91. - And it's goodnight to you! - Put your pyjamas on. - If you read me a story. - Only a short one. - A long one. - A long one. - A medium one. OK. He's cute. Without him I'd go mad. - Hi. - Hi, it's Sanne. I tried to call you. Shall we get together? Not such a good idea. Why not? It's Kasper. It's too confusing for him. I have to think of him too. - Has he said anything? - No, but I can tell. It's no good. - What do you mean? - It's no good. - We cant just stop now. - Yes, we can. I've got to go. Take care, OK? Darling? Christian! Christian! Why are you holding the door closed? Let me in. I just want to talk. Christian! Christian, darling, I want to talk to you. Christian! Sanne! Sanne! I just want to talk to you. Sanne! Sanne! What the hell are you doing? Get up! Get up, I said. Get out! Out! What the hell are you playing at? - It's not over, is it? - I haven't time for this. - Afterwards. I'll wait for you. - I told you it was no good. I just want to see you. And talk to you. Bloody lift! We'll walk. Haven't you got the message? - I can't live without you. - Of course you can. Go home. - I love you. - Don't give me such crap. We had fun. It was just for fun. John. Can I ask you something? It's Sanne. Forget it. Just forget it. Wouldn't it be better to sleep it off? What are you hanging around for? Darling. Who is she? - From high school? - No. Just someone I met. Where? Here. These flats? Do I know her? No. She's only just moved in. Oh. With her mum and dad? No. With her son. With her son? What do you mean, "with her son"? You wouldn't understand. With her son? How old is she? Thirty six. You can't have a girlfriend of thirty six. No. Apparently not. - Why do you have to be like this? - What do you mean? Why can't you have a girlfriend your own age? And be normal? - Normal? - She could be your mother. - It's sick. - Sick? You're the one who's sick. All you have in life is an obsession with me. Let me live my own life. - Move out, then. - I will. As soon as possible. Mum, come here. - No! - Yes, come here. I've had enough. Go away. - No. I have had enough. - Stop it, mum. Mum... Things going better now? Yes, things are fine. - I didn't like to ask. - No, quite. - You've moved on. - Yes, exactly. She said it wasn't good for her little boy. Oh? Well, of course ...maybe she's right. It might not have been good for you either. - No. You're right. - Bon appetit! Hi. - How are you doing? - Fine. I am going to the cinema with a girlfriend tonight. Maybe you could look after Kasper? I suppose... I'll fix some supper for you. Fine. See you then. Bye. 'Bye. What? What? Nothing. Where does your dad live? - I don't know. - Don't you see him? No. Not properly. Is your dad nice? He's dead. - Was he nice before he died? - Yes, but I didn't see much of him. My parents were divorced too. How did he die? He was ill. I was on the phone to him when he died. He said "Right, darling, it seems that it's time to say goodbye". And he dropped the receiver. I never saw him again. Are we going to have ice cream? - I have been missing you. - And me, you. - What happened? - I had to get my head straight. With Kasper and stuff. And another bloke? That as well. What is it? I can't stand the thought of you with somebody else. You don't need to. It's over. Have you seen him recently? I had to say goodbye properly. Did you sleep with him? Did you? Once. Was it good? It was the same as ever. What do you mean? It was OK. He is really buff. Great body. How old is he? - In his mid forties. - How disgusting! Was it better than with me? It is very different. In what way? I don't know. It's hard to say. Try. - Go on! - Chill, will you? I'm sorry. It's just... I don't love him. I don't love him. - Shall we do something nice today? - Sure. Just the three of us. It's the weekend. I need to see my mum today. - Do you really have to? - To talk about a deposit. - For what? - A flat, maybe. - A flat? - A studio flat. - We're going to look at it today. - Why not move in with us? - You've already got a key. - I've never lived on my own. I'm looking forward to it. It might be weird for Kasper, too. - What do you mean? - Suddenly having a stranger here. You're not a stranger. I'll have to talk to my mum about it. Is she the one who wants you to move? - No, it's me. - I expect she'll like having space. - I don't know. Maybe. - I'd like to meet her. I doubt it. - Why not? Do I embarrass you? - No, it's nothing to do with that. We could ask her to supper. I'd better think about it. This lousy knife! Are you nervous? Why should I be nervous? Because your mum's going to meet your new girlfriend? I don't see it like that. - How do you see it? - What do you mean? Aren't I your girlfriend? Is it because I'm older than you? Christian is 18. And you're 36. True, I am a bit older than Christian. Clever boy! That was a difficult one. I'll get it! - Is it a problem? - Is what? - That I am twice your age? - I don't know. - Of course you know. Is it? - Stop it, will you? Mum's here! Am I too old? Eh? - No. - Am I too old for you? Of course not. OK. - Hi, my name is Birgit. What's yours? - Kasper. - That's a fine name. - Thank you. So is yours. Hi, mum. Come in. - Hello, I'm Sanne. - Birgit. Thanks for the invite. Some chocolate for you and Kasper. That looks gorgeous. Christian doesn't eat that kind of thing. You do when you're here. You don't usually... you always say you don't want to get fat. I don't think there is any danger of that. - I don't eat that much, do I? - Oh, yes you do! Yesterday you ate almost a whole tub of icecream. What a lovely view! The flats are really nice. Christian and I have always liked living here. Kasper, a bit of lemon? No, thank you. - A lovely wine. - Three for a tenner. That's cheap. I only buy one bottle at a time. Christian doesn't like wine. It's quite normal at his age. I'm getting a taste for it. You're coping, aren't you? Pass the butter, please. Thank you. Thank you. - What do you do for a living, Sanne? - Nothing at the moment. I worked at a boutique and fell out with the boss. - It was messy. - It's not always easy. It suits me, though. It means I've time to settle in... and spend time with Kasper. And Christian, of course. Yes. He'll be off to university soon so he'll have a lot to attend to. Christian, will you help me in the kitchen? - Why didn't you say? - Say what? - About going to university. - I don't know. It... Why are you going? - To read Danish. - Danish? - There's nothing wrong with it. - Danish is for girls! I know why you've chosen Danish. I know what goes on there! - What are you on about? - You just want to shag the girls. "Christian, I get so horny when we talk books together". Stop it! That's not what it's like. If you go, we're through. You can't just say that. I want to get a degree. You don't care about a degree. You just want girls. You don't know that, OK! That's why people go to university. You have no idea what goes on there. - Oh, yes I do. - Oh? You got shagged there, maybe? Did you? Maybe. - Who by? - I don't remember. - So many that you don't remember? - It was ages ago. And just sex. You are rank. Just a cheap tart who shags around. If your mum could hear her sweet little boy now! Let her. You were the one in such a hurry. - Anything I can do? - I think we're OK, mum. - It smells delicious. - Thanks. How nice that you can make supper together! Your view is much better than ours. - What happened? - Nothing, darling. - Kasper, may I see your room? - Of course. Follow me. I'm sorry. It was jealousy. You don't like young girls who read clever books, do you? No. - I think they're boring. - Sure? Yes. You're only the one I want. Your mum is waiting for us. What? Where did you grow up? A village in the country. You wouldn't know it. - Oh? Do your parents still live there? - Yes. We're looking for a nice flat for Christian. We're talking about Christian moving in here. Here? For the time being. Oh. I see. Kasper, you can take your supper into your room. I know it may seem a bit much. Me having a kid and all. But it's happened so fast and we are so happy together. If it's what Christian wants... - It is, isn't it, Christian? - Yes. We can't control how we feel, after all. I'll get some more wine. She seems very nice. And she is very fond of you. But... She is much older than you. And a child on top. You'd be taking on a huge responsibility. Chill, mum. We're not exactly getting married. Don't you realize that for her this is for real? - Mummy, can I have some more Cola? - Haven't you had enough? - I could drink a drop more. - So could I. I so rarely drink wine. Maybe I should drink it more often. - How about a toast? - What to? - Mothers and sons! - Here's to mothers and sons! Cheers! You've always been a good boy. You've taken good care of me. I am sure it hasn't always been much fun. It's hard being... ...on your own. You've done well, mum. No, I haven't. I loved your father. You do know that, don't you? We... destroyed each other. He was so handsome. All the women had an eye for him. I was so proud that he was my husband. I never figured out how to tell him. If only I had... I feel sick. I must... Sorry. - I can't eat any more either. - That's all right. Sorry. I'm not used to meat. My stomach can't take it. I'll see you home, mum. No, you stay here with your girlfriend and her lovely son. I'll see you home. Come on. Is she all right? - Why did she drink so much? - She was nervous. Also, you moving in here. She doesn't like it. What a weird night! Would you like to be my man? - Your man? - Do you? What do you mean? Am I your woman? - I suppose so. - Am I or aren't I? You are. - Then tie me up. - Tie you up? Are you sure you aren't hungry? You look as if you could do with a sandwich. No, thanks. - Is something wrong? - No, I'm just tired. - Are you going to Sanne's? - I don't think so. I'm going to sit in the living room. Come in if you want. - OK. I'll just phone her first. - Do that. Hi, darling! I have phoned you so many times! - My phone was on silent. - You said you'd come for supper. Why didn't you come? Is something wrong? Is it your mother? I think we should stop. - Are you there? - What did you say? - We should stop seeing each other. - Have you got someone else? - No. That's not it. - What is it, then? I don't know if I can get tied down. Who says you should get tied down? That stuff about moving in... It was only a suggestion. I can't do it. - What can't you do? - Any of it. - You said you loved me. - Yes. And all of a sudden you don't? - I don't know anything right now. - You are such a baby. Mummy's boy. - Don't. - Do you love me or don't you? OK. Fine. Christian. Christian! What's going on? Someone's shouting in the yard. Christian, somebody is calling you. Christian! The poor girl is beside herself. Go downstairs to her. - What have you done? - Nothing. - That can't be true. - I said it was over. - You can't do that. - Stay out of it. Go to her. Sanne! Have you gone mad? There... This is no good. It's no good. Don't you like me at all? Of course I like you. - Do you like lying with me like this? - Yes. So why not get under the duvet? Take off your pants? - I've got to go. - Not yet. Hold me. You mustn't go yet. I'm going now, Sanne. - I want you to have a feel. - No. Not now. Have a feel. I did it for you. Feel how smooth I am. What are you doing there? - I don't know. I fell asleep. - Stay there. I'm just changing. Are you going? - Yes. I've got no choice. - Why not? I have no choice. Yes. It's not for me to interfere. No. As long as she doesn't make a fuss at night again. Can I get you anything? I don't feel like anything. I just need to sleep. OK. Where have you been? - I had to pop home. - You were gone for ages. I fell asleep. You turned your phone off. I thought you weren't coming. I don't like your phone being off. - I'm here now. - You won't go again, will you? Mummy! Come down and play! I'm making lunch, darling. But I've got someone else who will. Hi, Christian! Come down and play! Coming! - I'll be Torres. - OK, I'll be Ronaldo. Cry baby! - Will you take him down a sandwich? - Yes. - Want one? - No, thanks. Hey! You forgot to kiss me. - What is it? - What's that smell? I don't know. What is it? - I knew it. - Knew what? You've been shagging some bird. - What? - You stink of perfume. Stop it! You're the only girl I've screwed. Who uses cheap perfume like that? - It's my mother's, for fuck's sake! - So you shag your mum, do you? Mummy!
