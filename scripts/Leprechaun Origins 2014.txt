Catherine, look! Francois, stop! (RUSTLING) (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (FLESH TEARING) (FRANCOIS SHOUTING) (GROWLING) (SOBBING) (ROARING) (FRANCOIS SHOUTING) (PANTING) (GROWLING) (CATHERINE WHIMPERING) (ROARING) (CATHERINE SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (LAUGHING) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Is this it? Um... (LAUGHING) Okay. DAVID: I guess. Well, I can see why this isn't a tourist destination. DAVID: You wanna go back? JENI: And get inside the truck? No, you? The village is down that road a stretch. The village is down this road? Do you mind driving us another 15 minutes to the village? No, no, no. No, no. I can't do that. (CHUCKLING) Let's just pay him and keep going, babe, okay? It can't be that far. We can just walk. Sure. BEN: Thank you. (CHUCKLING) Okay. Man, this is ridiculous. Awesome. What is that thing? This village is only like 300 years old. But it's said to have housed some of the oldest Celtic artifacts known to man. Whoa. Now that's creepy. Oh, boy. (DAVID GRUMBLING) (CHUCKLING) You got a pretty mouth, girl! (GIGGLING) There must be some mistake. Only mistake was trusting you with our last weekend in Ireland. (IRISH FOLK MUSIC PLAYING INSIDE) Nothing like that old Irish charm, huh? Maybe this place won't be a bust after all. Get you kids somethin'? Oh, um... Four pints would be great. Sounds good. Follow me. Sit yourself down. Thank you. Thanks. (GIGGLING) DAVID: Look at this place. You could do your masters of history thesis just on this place, Soph. (LAUGHING) What do you know about history? DAVID: I know everything about history. I know it's exactly what I'm gonna make of these pints our lovely barmaid has brought us! (GIRLS LAUGHING) DAVID: Thank you. BEN: Cheers. ALL: Cheers. To Ireland. (LAUGHING) Actually, I'm not sure I'm gonna enroll in Berkeley for my master's. What? Yeah. I mean, with Ben going to Harvard and everything, I thought I might just check out the east coast for a while. Really? (CLEARS THROAT) But you've wanted to get your master's in history since you were like two, Soph. It's not like Berkeley's going anywhere, and neither is history. So, uh, is this quaint little village everything our potential historian hoped it would be? I'm not sure yet, okay? We haven't even seen anything. Okay. Excuse me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation, and I hope you don't think me too nosy, but you seem to be a bit of a history buff. Come to see the village's ancient historical sites, have you? Hamish McConville. (LAUGHING) I'm Sophie. Now, if it's real history you want to see you need to see the Clocha de na Deithe. Clock de le what? (GIGGLING) The Clocha de na Deithe? Stones of the... Fathers? That's good, very close. The Stones of the Gods. Sounds terrifying. I'm in! Man, me, too! What exactly are The Stones of the Gods? Well, let me tell you. The Clocha de na Deithe is a collection of enormous stone sculptures found in the middle of a cave in the woods. Now, these sculptures are thought to be the oldest existing historical artifacts in all of Ireland. Quite possibly the cradle of Celtic civilization itself. You're kidding. Why have we never heard of them before? Oh, no, you won't find mention of the Clocha de na Deithe in any guidebooks. No, there's lots of things about our village that people don't know about. A lot of things that we like to keep private from the tourist trade. But you being a history buff yourself, you're not your usual tourist, are you? (LAUGHING) Well, thank you. How do we get there? Now there... It's about a seven hour hike from here. (LAUGHING) Seven hours? Ouch. Well, you could always stay in one of the cabins down the road. Leave first thing in the morning, you'd be back by tomorrow night. That is, if you'd like, of course. A cabin in the woods? What's not to like? I like your attitude. Well, what's not to like is that this was supposed to be a day trip, guys. (CLEARS THROAT) Okay. So it's an overnight. Who cares? Well, let's put it to a vote, then! All in favor? All opposed? What's it gonna be, Soph? Let's do it! Let's do it. Yes. It's gonna be fun. DAVID: (WHISPERING) It's gonna be fun. Too bad, buddy. Are you kidding me? I know, okay? But I just... I think this could be a really cool thing. Like once in a lifetime. And you know how many medical conferences I've sat through for you. All right. Good. Tell you what, I'll call my son, and he'll come and pick us up. Now drink up, all of you. All right? (LAUGHING) Hey, thanks, man. Thank you. Cheers. (VEHICLE APPROACHING) There it is, guys. Hey, there you are, Sean. Look at that. This is Ben, Sophie, David, and Jennifer. Now look at that, it's not pretty, but it does the job, so... Let's go. Oh, boy. Hey. (AMERICAN FOLK MUSIC ON RADIO) SEAN: I thought you said there were only gonna be a couple of 'em. Four is fine, son. Turn that radio up. Don't, Da! Oh, come on. Lighten up, would you? I'm driving here. The poor boy gets cranky in the summer. Who doesn't like the summer? SEAN: What's to love about it, nancy boy? Did he just call me a nancy boy? Yup. Ah, throw us another one, would you? That's the spirit. (SIGHS) So we saw these stones on the outside of the village, and I don't know too much about Celtic symbols... All right, bullshit. What? But do you know by chance what the symbols on the stones mean? I've got no idea, darlin'. Them stones have been there for centuries, long before our village was built. But I tell you, about 15 years ago we discovered gold in an old Celtic cave. Turned it into a mine. Stones were there, too. But eventually the cave collapsed. Well, things ain't been the same round here ever since. Times, they can't be that tough. Ah, this? A guest gave that to me. Oh. It's a Rolex. It's a pretty nice gift. Well, I guess he appreciated my hospitality. (SINGING) Da, you're making my ears bleed. It's not that bad. It's pretty nice. It's kind of run down though, but whatever! That's not where you're staying. That's where we lived before the mine closed. HAMISH: Well, there it is. The trail is right down there. You sure it's safe? It's falling down a little. Ah, no. She's solid. On the inside. Just needs a lick of paint, that's all. Good as new. We have to guard against break-ins when the place isn't being used. You let a lot of people stay here? You said The Stones of the Gods was the village's best kept secret. Yeah. Well, that's why the cabin don't get much use. (RUSTLING) (CREAKING) Do you hear that? Look! There. What is that? Get behind me. I said get behind me! (RUSTLING) Think you got it? Nah, it was too fast. Sorry about all that. What was that? What was that all about? Well, there's a lot of wild boars round these parts. They can get pretty nasty. Anyway... Sorry to give you such a scare. Let's get you settled. Come on. (CHUCKLING) You okay? HAMISH: Right, here we are then. Now there's no power, but no problem. The miracle of modern technology, eh? Can I give you some money for those beers? Oh, no, thanks. I'm good. Oh, good. Because I didn't bring my Rolex. (CHUCKLING) You're a funny boy. But there's lots of other things I could steal from you. (LAUGHING LOUDLY) Gotcha. Let's go, son. Well, I'm sure the rooms are fine. DAVID: Let's check out the rooms. Okay. Oh, we got a queen size! (ENGINE STARTING) Thanks, again, for agreeing to do this. Mmm-hmm. It means a lot to me. And have you thought at all about me coming out your way? Uh, I think it sounds interesting. Okay. Well, I mean... Do you really think you could give all this up? I know I'd miss you. I'd miss you, too. Good night. Good night, babe. (BEER SPILLING ON FLOOR) David? David! (SNORING) (COUGHING) Seriously? What? What's up, baby? You good? (THUMPING) Did you hear that? (THUMPING) (THUMPING) (LOUD THUMPING) (GASPING) David, David, wake up! David, wake up! You guys. Holy fuck. Whoa, whoa, what's going on? There's something out there. What do you mean? (STAMMERING) The window? That's why they call it the woods, babe. Lions and tigers and chickens and shit. Hey. Jesus, what's up? (WHIMPERING) She said she saw something in the woods. (LAUGHING) Okay. (LAUGHING) You okay? I don't see anything. It's probably just a wild boar... No, no. It was not a boar, you guys. Maybe just your overactive imagination? It was not my fucking imagination, David! We cannot stay here. Okay, okay. Hey. Listen, I'll check. I'll check. You're gonna go outside right now? (DOOR RATTLING) It's locked. What? What? DAVID: It's locked from the outside. What do you mean? Do you have a key? JENI: What is going on? (ROARING) That doesn't make any sense. They locked us in here? They locked us in here? No, they didn't lock us in here. That's the only door, right? What? No. What is going on, you guys? You sure he didn't give you a key? BEN: No. DAVID: That doesn't make any sense. All the windows are barred, yeah? (GROWLING) (SHRIEKING) Ow, fuck! Whoa, what was that? What happened? (ROARING) (SOPHIE SCREAMING) What? What the... (ALL SCREAMING) What the fuck was that? Jesus Christ! (SCREAMING) Please stop, please stop! (SOBBING) Please stop. It'll be okay. It'll be okay. (SOBBING) (BANGING ON DOOR) Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it got your ear. What? Oh, God. It's okay, we're safe. We're safe now. You think it's gone? (CRYING) What was that? I don't know. (LOW GRUMBLING) Jesus Christ... I saw... Okay, wait. Shh! Quiet. (BANGING ON DOOR) Let me out, let me out, let me out! Let me out, fuck! Please let me out. (CRASHING) (ALL SCREAMING) DAVID: Shit, let's go! How the hell are we getting out of here? Same way it got in! Climb out! Come on, let's go! (FLESH RIPPING) My leg! Close the fucking door! Okay, okay, I got it. (GIRLS SCREAMING) Fuck! Fucking close the door! Okay, go, go, go, go, go! (GROWLING) BEN: Fuck! Come on, man. Fuck! SOPHIE: They locked us in there so that thing would kill us. They're assuming we're dead. What about the house? Maybe there's a phone or something. Come on! Hey! (GUTTURAL GROWL) Fuck! Guess what. Hey, over here! Come on, over here! What is that... What is that thing, man? It can't get in. (THUMPING) What is that? Were you gonna just fucking leave me out there? Take it easy. Where were you? You okay? Okay. Okay, guys. Come on we gotta find a phone. Sophie. Hey. Sit down. Come on, sit down. It's gotta be done, son. This doesn't feel right, Da. It's never easy. Ah, thanks, Ian. No problem. Not sure my son has the stomach for this, after all. Wouldn't it be easier just to leave this village? You don't abandon your home just because the times get tough. Round these parts you fight for what's yours. By letting innocent people die? No, Sean, not innocent. Outsiders. Now they came here of their own free will. We're just giving 'em a little push in the right direction, that's all. Hey, Dave, this is gonna hurt, man. (WHISPERING) God... Should've been enough time, huh? Seem to have misplaced my watch. There didn't have to be four of them. You knew there would come a time when you'd have to give us a helpin' hand rather than stayin' back where it's safe and letting other people do the dirty work. Yeah, well... Maybe if you all hadn't have been so greedy, and taken all that gold from its cave... Well, maybe if we increase our offerin', we can buy us some lenience the next time! Next time... This is it. Oh, my God, this is the symbol that was on the stone outside of town. That's it. It can't be right. What? It means... Tuatha De Danann. What the fuck does that mean? Leprechaun. Come on! Leprechaun? I'm just telling you what it says. Whatever it is, you think that's what they dug up in that mine? It wasn't a mine originally, it was a cave. But the people in the village took the gold, that's what Hamish said to us. Okay, now we're talking pots of gold? I know. I know it sounds crazy, but... SOPHIE: This is what happens when you take its gold. You have to make amends. Until the debt has been repaid. So they put us in this cabin they locked us in there to sacrifice us to a leprechaun? You guys, my earring was gold. Okay, guys, leprechaun, Tuatha de, whatever the hell, killing machine, whatever the fuck it is. How do we get out of here? Look, these stones are like a boundary, like an ancient warning sign or something. SOPHIE: Maybe the leprechaun won't go past a certain distance from its cave... So? So, if we make it to the stones... Then what, the leprechaun won't go past the stones, Sophie? Really? No, that makes sense. That's why the guy who dropped us off didn't go past them. We have to get back there. Jesus Christ. Where the hell are they? They got out? If they're still alive, that means it hasn't fed! Let's go! HAMISH: In the trucks, now! (TRUCK DOOR CLOSES) HAMISH: Lord, have mercy. They're back. What are we going to do, guys? Everybody grab something! HAMISH: Check downstairs, down the basement! Check the attic! Lord, have mercy... Just drop the gun, man. (COCKS GUN) HAMISH: Atta boy, Sean. Well done. Drop it, guys. I don't think so, boy-o. How the hell did all of you get out of that cabin? Maybe they've earned their freedom, Da. And have that thing, come back to our village? Start preyin' on us again? Or you? Just let us go... You be quiet, missy. (GUNSHOT) It's Ian. It's Ian! Out with me now, come on! I'll deal with you later! (GUNSHOT) You bolt that door. Make sure they don't come out! (BUSHES RUSTLING IN DISTANCE) How we getting out of here? (CHOPPING) That'll work. SOPHIE: Come on. Shit! BEN: Fuck, ah, fuck! No keys! No keys! We gotta get to the stones, come on! (RUSTLING) (CLANGING) Ian. Behind you. (GROWLING) (GUNSHOT) You gotta get up, man. I can't. My leg. Oh, my God! My leg! I can't do this. I can't do this. Yes, you can. Oh, my God, you guys! Hey, hey! Hey! Help! Hey! Stop, stop, stop! What're you kids doing out here this time of night? We need your help! Hamish and his son, they... Did they try to hurt you? Please, we need your help. Hurry, get in the back. Thank you. Let's go. Hey, come on. Come here, baby. Now just stay tight here. We gotta get out. Try your doors. Try your doors! Oh, my God, are we locked in? Good work, Mary. Thank you, Hamish. The doors aren't opening. Get out of the car, all of you! Out of the car. Now! All of you! Step away from the car. Please don't do this. If we don't keep this thing satisfied, there'll be hell to pay. You're so pathetic. This is your fault, not ours. I could shoot you. But we need all of you alive. You can't just leave us out here alone! Oh, we're not leaving you... Alone. (GRUNTING) BEN: (DISTORTED) Sophie, wake up! BEN: You okay? (GROWLING) You guys. Did you hear that? (GROWLING) (YELLING) BEN: Sophie! SOPHIE: Ben! Get away from me! Please! No, no, no, no, no! (SCREAMING) Get away! (DISTORTED) Get away from me! Get away from me! No! Get off me! David! Don't leave us, don't leave us! (BOTH SCREAMING) Help! Come on! He's not going to make it. Sophie! Come on! We've got to keep going back to the cabin! What? Why? Because we're gonna kill it. (ALL PANTING) All right. We just need to find a way to lock it from the outside once it's inside. It's inside? Yeah. One of us is gonna be outside, the other two will be in here waiting. Okay? You don't have to be in here with it, okay? You just need to be outside, bolt the door once it's in here. We'll do everything else, okay? I know you can do this, okay? You can do this. You sure we can do this? (GROWLING) BEN: Okay. He's coming! (SCREAMING) Oh, my God! Oh, God! (SCREAMING) Sophie. Sophie, no! We're not going back to the farmhouse. There's the truck. BEN: Come on. Come on! Hurry! (SCREAMS) (LEPRECHAUN GROWLING) (SCREAMING) Come on! (SCREAMING) Where did he go? Shit! We have to get to the stones! There's no keys. There's no keys. (LEPRECHAUN GROWLING) (BOTH SCREAMING) Where did it go? Why didn't you come back? What? When I fell. Why didn't you come back for me? I came to the truck so we could get the fuck out of here. The keys have to be on him. Oh, shit. We have to get the keys from him. (GROWLING) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You stay here. I'll go get the keys. No. (GROWLING CONTINUES) (BOTH SCREAMING) Take this. We need a distraction. I'll get the keys. No, no, no, no. I'll be fine on my own. Okay. Okay. (SCREAMING) (YELLING) We have to go! Go, go, go, go! (STRUGGLING) Farmhouse! (GROWLING) Oh! (SCREAMING) We've gotta go! Go, get to the attic! (YELLING) (SOBBING) (GROWLING) (CRYING QUIETLY) (CREAKING BELOW) (SOBBING QUIETLY) Please. (GROWLING) (CRYING LOUDLY) (GROWLING) (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOTS) Put your hands up real slow-like. (LEPRECHAUN GROWLING) Jeez, Sean! Sean, you done real good, son. You done real good. Real good. I'm so sorry. Run. What? Run, get out of here! What the hell you doin', boy? You lettin' her escape! Put your gun down now. What? I said, put it down! You've always been a fool. How are you gonna shoot a girl, Da? Is that what you've become, a murderer? Hey, you wanna shoot me? Go ahead, shoot me! The shit you make me do. You're a goddamned fool! (STRUGGLING) (GROANING) (CRASHING) (LOUD GROWLING) (SCREAMING) Sean? The window! Ahhh! (HAMISH SCREAMING) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (SOBBING) (ENGINE STARTING) (WHIMPERING) Get off! Get off! (SHRIEKING) Get off! Get the fuck off me! (GROWLING LOUDLY) (SCREAMING) (THUDDING) (ENGINE SPUTTERING) (GROWLING) (SHRIEKING) (LOUD ROAR) Fuck you, Lucky Charms. (PANTING HEAVILY) (LOUD GROWL) (LOUD GROWL)
