Oh, and can you bring some pencils too when you- Oh, what about Brennan? What about him? Oh, uh, hi. If you play, the teams will be uneven. No, no, dad, he can be on mine and mike's team, right? He can actually just play for me. I don't really feel like playing right now anyway. Oh, don't be scared, mike. I'm even giving you an extra player. Dad, are you really that eager to lose? Last time mom said you cried yourself to sleep. Well... Elise said you had a nightmare and screamed like a little girl. This seems like a family thing.

This always confuses me. Hey, could you scoot over London? Yeah, sorry. Well, it's an American sport. I just meant I don't understand why you play American football on your holidays If baseball is your national pastime. Baseball is our pastime, but football is our sport. There's a difference. Oh! Let the big dog eat! You know, I think some of those guys enjoy that a little too much. - What, the butt slapping? - Yeah. I bet you'd be surprised how many gays there are in The NFL. Mike, watch this kid eat. Howard, leave Brennan alone. It's amusing! Is it? I'm kidding. It's a joke. You got burned, dad. Yeah, that was, that was good, I like that. So, what's so amusing about the way you eat? Oh, I like to eat one thing at a time. You know, it's better for you anyway. It's good for your digestive system. Honey, have you met any nice college girls? Mom, none that you'd like. Any that I'd like? So, anyways, after we're done here, I'm gonna go over to Alex's, if that's okay. I'll come too! That's a great idea. You'll love Alex. Great. Okay. Hey. Hey. How's it going? Yeah, it's good to see you. Uh, this is Brennan. Hey, uh, Alex... Nixon. No relation. To who? Good one What's this? They're, uh, cacti. Cacti? What a fag. Your turn? Oh, no. I'm okay. I'm not really... you ever lifted before? No. Come on, give it a try. No, I'm- Come on, sit down. How much do you weigh? One-Fifty-Ish. Well, this is 155 on here, So a perfectly healthy person Should be able to bench their own body weight. Can you? Yeah, I'm one-Eighty and I can bench two-Sixty-Five. Just straight back. Okay, you ready? Hands out here. Don't tuck your thumbs in. This, uh, feels weird... It's alright. You know who Arnold Schwarzenegger is? Yeah. This is how he lifts. Alright you ready? Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no- - You got it. You got it! - Hold on Mike! Alright. Relax. Pathetic. Why are you forcing Brennan to sleep on the couch? I didn't force him to do shit. Alright, we played rock, paper, scissors for it tonight and he lost. Yeah, well, you forced him to lift weights. Did he come home crying to you? No, Alex called me. Look, he could have hurt himself. You, out of all people, know what can happen if you push yourself too far. I know you don't like anybody staying in your room, There's something off about him, Elise. I mean, did you guys check him out at all? Mike, he's a really nice guy. Oh my god, you like him. Admit it. Mike, good night. Admit it! Do you know what that feels like? To be disrespected? I know. I did it. I'm sorry. And what about the fucking cacti? You like cacti. I know. Okay... I was being an asshole. Yeah, how about a thoughtless and arrogant prick. Okay. I deserve it. But I was just pissed off. Alright, but I'm leaving tomorrow... and I want to be with you tonight. What is your problem with Brennan, anyway? He seems like a nice guy. I just don't like him. That's not like you, mike. You need to relax. I'm gonna be back in a month, alright? I'll make this up to you, I promise. She does this every time mike leaves. It's why we rented out the room. Where are you going? To help. Mike's back in a month, he's counting on you to have this house ready for Christmas. Don't want to disappoint him now, do you? No, of course not. Did Elise put you up to this? What? Trying to make me feel better. No, it was my idea, Mrs. Henderson. You know, I never really knew my mother. She died of cancer when I was very young. You know, you remind me of her. Smell like her. Ah, so sweet. I'm so sorry about your mommy. It's okay. I'll take these clothes up to mike's room for you, Mrs. Henderson. You can call me Candi. How about mum? Of course. Call me what you like. Cheer up, mum. Who's your idol? Schwarzenegger. Him? Yeah, Six time Mr. Olympia, Film icon, governor of California, Stud. And you're obsessed with his pecs. Just admit it. I have pecs. But his are better. I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that Because I definitely have better hair and a better ass. I have a casual ass. What? You have a casual ass? What does Schwarzenegger have? He's got a serious ass, obviously. Name something that grosses you out. Peanut butter. Peanut butter, you poor child. Yeah, I'm allergic to it, asshole. And secondly, I... I don't know, the texture is just like, you know. The texture's what? Okay, who would win in a fair fight: Superman or wolverine? Superman. Is that your final answer? Yeah, it's no contest. Clark Kent is so not cool man. He's only cool when he's superman. No, I get it, but that's what I like about it. You know, it's like... all of his potential is hidden underneath. When the shirt comes open, and the dorky glasses come off, And the hair changes... it's kick ass time. Mike, Don't hide that face. Come on. I've got so much footage of pillows, I don't need anymore. Who's your idol? Schwarzenegger. When the shirt comes open... shirt comes open. - Dorky glasses come off... - Dorky glasses come off. - Hair changes... - Hair changes. - ...it's kick ass time. - It's kick ass time. Hey What happened to your shoes? They were stolen off my feet. Georgia rest stop. Stolen off your feet in a Georgia rest stop? You know, you should be more careful. Take it easy. There you are! Where have you been? Just out for a walk. Well, if you boys get to bed now you can go fishing in the morning. Uh, I don't know, uh, he's a late sleeper. Sounds great! I'll set my alarm. What time? 4:30 I'll set my alarm for 4. I know, I know. Catch and release. You don't have a pole. He can use mike's. He can try. Great. I'll see you in a few hours. - Sweet dreams. - Good night. Oh, I got one! Okay, alright, reel it in. Slow, slow, slow. Been here all day we haven't had one bite. That pole's a bigger tease than any woman on this planet. Mike's the only one who can use it. We'll see. So, I forgot to ask. Why here? Thought I could get some nice pictures. What part of England did you say you were from? London. Family there? I don't have a family. My father died in a plane crash when I was three. Mother worked a lot. One day, she didn't pick me up from school. Spent a lot of years in foster care. Sorry, Brennan. It's alright. You didn't know. Besides... I got you guys now. Isn't he great? How do you know he's a he? Don't be a smart ass! He's ugly. Don't hate! Hermit crabs have a hard enough time as it is. You know, they constantly outgrow their shells because They're never happy with their place in the world. So... my dad got you this morning. I was wondering if you wanted to go out with me tonight. You mean, like a date? Well, no, that's not really- No, no, it doesn't have to be a date. I just, I just didn't think that- Yeah, I'm just playing. Sure. I can't believe you're still up. You and Brennan must have left the house at 4:30 this morning? Hey baby, I still got it. Did you catch anything? Nah. Poor Brennan. Growing up without a mother. Can you imagine? You mean a father. What are you talking about? His father died in a plane crash. His mother died of cancer. I thought she walked out on him. Well, Maybe she left and then she died. That's so sad. Good night, honey. Good night. Hey, I'll race you to jenny's pier. You mad? You can have a head start if you think I'm gonna beat you. Shove off. Yeah? Yeah. Cheater! Come on, I thought you said you could beat me. Ow!

Yeah, something like that. Wanna hear a scary story? Oh. Sure. I... I'm going to blind fold you. Okay... Kay. Can you see? No. Okay. Come on. I do not want to do this anymore. Why did I let you do this again? We're almost there. Watch out, watch out... okay, alright now take a big step up, big step up. - Are you laughing at me? - Yes, I am. Turn around. Are you good? You got your balance? Yeah. Got it. Okay. Now, I want you to imagine A man and a woman Standing on a pier. The man's name is Frederick And the woman's name is jenny. Now, I want you to imagine them kissing. What happened to their clothes? Well, it sounds like they're kissing naked. - That's me, I don't... - Ha, okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, Frederick is wearing a suit And jenny is wearing a white dress. Okay, so they're newlyweds. Okay, jenny is wearing a blue dress. Blue dress, got it. Frederick, jenny, blue dress. Okay. Now I want you to imagine them passionately kissing Like forbidden lovers. But wait! They're not alone. Someone is standing, watching them on the pier. Another man. And suddenly, he charges them And pushes jenny in the ocean! Was that it? That didn't scare you? No. Huh. It's kind of lame, huh? Yeah, but I'll forgive you. Yeah, well, it's actually true. Really? Yeah. Body get sucked out to sea? Sharks ate it. Get off it. No, I'm serious. It's a primary feeding place, 'Cause the shrimp boats come into the current in and out of here. They actually shut off the pier in the summer times for the swimmers. So what's your dad got against you being a fish scientist anyway? Oh, my dad was a football jock. He dislocated his shoulder. Mike was a track star, blew out his knee. And I was the swimmer. And I gave it all up to study fish. At least you know what makes you happy. Yeah. What about you? Are your parents okay with you being a photographer? I don't know. Died when I was eight. Oh, I'm sorry. Got hit by a drunk driver. Car got pushed off a bridge into a lake. Cold? Yeah, give me my scarf back. Hang on, I need to like untie it after your little... your little fantastic trick. It was good. That was good! I had a really nice night. Me too. What Nothing.

Wait. What do these mean? Nothing. Tell me a secret. You first. I asked you first. Yeah, well I'm better looking. Okay. When I was thirteen I shared a room in a foster home with a couple of twins. Child prodigies or something. They read all the time. When one finished a book, They'd give it to the other. One day they started talking about a book I thought sounded cool. So I asked if I could read it. And they said no. Fucking right they said no. They started carrying on about how I was too stupid to read. That I should stick to picture books. Kids can be mean. Yeah. But I got them back. When I left, I gave myself a little going away present. I gathered every book they owned And I burned all of them. Except the one they wouldn't give me. That one I kept. What book was it? Catcher in the rye. Did you read it? Tried to. Every time, I'd just get more angry. Plus... what? It didn't have enough pictures. Is that you, Brennan? Yeah. I was getting a drink and I heard mike talking in his sleep. Really? Yeah. He hasn't talked in his sleep since puberty. It always feels so right when he's home. Sweet dreams, angel. I've always wondered what that's like. What? To be part of a family. Goodnight, Brennan. Goodnight. Get some sleep. - You have a casual ass? - You have a casual ass? He's got a serious ass, obviously. Name something that grosses you out. - Peanut butter. - Peanut butter. Peanut butter. Poor child. - Yeah, I'm allergic to it! - I'm allergic to it! Asshole. Blah. Blah. Okay, who would win in a fair fight: Superman or wolverine? Superman. Yeah, no contest. Clark Kent is so not cool, man. I get it, but that's what I like about him. All this potential underneath. Shirt comes open... glasses come off... hair changes... it's kick ass... that's twister. Charades is just- - That's right, that's right. - Moving around from the waist up. You go first. Okay. Brennan made these cookies especially for you. What? Why? It's a small thank you to you guys for your hospitality, And to you mike, for everything you shared with me. - That's sweet. - I know! I can't. I'm stuffed. Oh, mike. No, really, mom, I ate too much. Thanks. Mike, you can eat one. Honey, you're being rude. What's the matter you? I didn't raise you to be this way. Have a cookie. Mom, I'm not hungry. He's not hungry. Howard! Fine! I'll eat a cookie. Oh, it's not that bad. Mike, here. Oh my god, mike. Son! Oh my god, mike! Thanks, kid, you're the best. Your parents? Died when I was twelve. Tough break. They were shits. What are you keeping it for? Throw it out. They were alright when I was younger. I want to remember them. Kid, I've lived a long time. I've done some things. I've watched people. I don't know shit, I don't know shit, Except this. You can't change what you are. Is he okay? He's fine. What happened? He had an allergic reaction. There was peanut butter in the cookies. Oh my god, it's my fault. You're goddamn right it was! I want you out of here! I didn't know. How would I know? Get out! Fine. Brennan. Nice going, dad. I want that kid out of this house tonight! That's not our problem, and stop making excuses for him! Sorry about my dad. Mike's just his whole world. He's really protective of the family. I understand. You know, when I was a little girl, Dad used to say our family was like a sand castle And that all our problems were like the tides. Even a strong enough castle... can withstand any tide. Don't. What, are you afraid someone's gonna see us? You shouldn't touch me like that. It's not appropriate. You're back. Look, I'm sorry man, I really didn't know you were allergic to peanut butter. Like hell you didn't. Mike. You stole my medal, You took my knife, And you just tried to kill me, asshole. I swear I didn't know. Look, I really don't think he knew mike. It's good to have you back. Bullshit. He tried to kill me, and you're still on his side. I'm not choosing sides. I just think he made a mistake. There's something really wrong with him, Elise. He didn't have a family, cut him some slack. You should really try to rest up. Brennan, thank you for letting mike sleep in his own bed tonight. It's the least I could do. Goodnight. Sleep well. It's mike. Can you meet me by jenny's pier in 15 minutes. It's about Brennan. Who are you talking to? I was just mumbling to myself. What are you doing? Well, you seemed upset the other night so... I'll forgive you. I wanted to come and make it up to you properly. What are you doing? What does it look like? Look, stop, alright. Someone might catch us. Yeah, well, that didn't stop you the other night. Stop! Look, I'm sorry. It was a mistake. What was? Grabbing me or fucking me? Both. Stop following me. Where are you going? What's the rope for? Go home. Goddamn it, Brennan! Don't you care about me? Of course, I care about you. I care about you a lot. I needed someone the other night, and you were there. Then what's the problem. You're like a sister to me. I like it like that. You're the sister I never had... to protect and share secrets with. Yeah, well you don't have sex with your sister. At least not in this country. Not in mine either. That's why it can't happen again. You have to be my sister. I don't have to be your anything. Mike was right about you. I'm sorry you feel that way, But your dad doesn't like fish scientists. How's he gonna feel about having a little slut... for a daughter? You wouldn't. Try me... now go! Like a sister... for once, I'm the punctual one. Sorry. What did you want to talk to me abou- Mike! Mike! Wake up, something's going on! Please... it's Brennan, he's not here. You were right, something's really wrong with him. Stay here. Bad dreams? Get the fuck out of here, you're not welcome. Alex asked me to say goodbye. What did you do to him? Come on, tell me what you did. Here's what you're going to do- No! No! Here's what you're fucking... you fucking touched him, I'll kill you! Go ahead. And then you'll never find him. Like two star-Crossed lovers. So sad. Fuck you. Now here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go inside and tell everybody the truth about you. And if you're still here when I get back I'm going to fucking kill you. Go ahead. Tell them about me and I'll tell them about you. What about me? About you and Alex Being fairies. Where is Alex?

So you drift along the road the sun sets our path and You you follow it till it's gone  oh, but the gypsy said you were wrong the cave is ten miles west and you'll see it there when you go don't go the trip has your weary soul it leaves nothing alone don't go we may never see you whole it wont leave you alone drift on home
