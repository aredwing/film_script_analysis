Wait until next time. =You shouldn't be wasting your money.= =Just think about what to buy Su Jin for her birthday besides a puppy.= =Just think about what to buy Su Jin for her birthday besides a puppy.= Our place is too small for a dog.

I bought the cake. Se Hyeon, I'll be home soon! =Okay.= Yes, Sir. I am Lee Jeong Su with the Hado Agency. I'm driving now, so please go ahead. =I told you that I needed 10 cars.= =But it turns out I'm a little short of funds.= =I've decided to buy 8. Can you include 3 fire extinguishers?= Sir, my life's motto is all about 3 things. Offer more. Deliver more. Discount more. Of course we can. Especially since it affects children's safety. =You're very refreshing. Then I'll buy 8. Let's sign the contract on Monday.= Thank you, Sir. I will continue to work hard. =So, what is the total cost?= I was a liberal arts major, so my math skills aren't very good. I'll stop the car after this tunnel and figure it out.

Hello? =Dialing emergency 119.= =Dialing emergency 119.= =Dialing emergency 119.= Hello? =This is 119. What's your emergency? Yes. The tunnel has collapsed here and I'm trapped inside.

If there's no traffic, they should be there in 5 minutes.= Hello? Mister. =Please wait in a safe place.= Hello? Safe place? What bullshit. If he'd only put in $30 worth of gas, I would have made it through this tunnel. Seriously. -=119 Rescue Team=- =How is the tunnel?= =What?= Dear viewers, there has been another disaster in our country. Dear viewers, there has been another disaster in our country. This time, a tunnel. Just a month after opening, a tunnel has tragically collapsed. Just a month after opening, a tunnel has tragically collapsed. Now just as you all can see, the mountain above the tunnel has completely collapsed. There is a slide at the area of construction above the tunnel. There is a slide at the area of construction above the tunnel. The entrance to the north side of the tunnel is completely blocked. From the south entrance, it looks as if there was an attack. Everything is pitch-black from the dust. Because of the new construction, Because of the new construction, there was almost no traffic through the Hado Tunnel. But the first call made to 119 was made from someone inside the tunnel. Inside the collapsed tunnel, at least one person has been trapped. Consideration is being given as to how to approach the incident. The identity of the person in the tunnel is now confirmed. He is a 38-year-old car salesman from Hado. Once again. The first call from the Hado Tunnel came from a 38-year-old man. The first call from the Hado Tunnel came from a 38-year-old man. He has been identified as Lee Jeong Su. He has been identified as Lee Jeong Su. We have determined the man trapped in the collapsed tunnel is Lee Jeong Su. Hello? =Hello? Is this Lee Jeong Su?= Yes. =You're the Lee Jeong Su who's trapped in the tunnel, right?= =You're the Lee Jeong Su who's trapped in the tunnel, right?= Yes, have you arrived? =Hurry, connect us!= =I am SNC reporter, Jo Yang Cheol.= Lee Jeong Su, =It's okay with you if we broadcast this interview, right?= =Broadcasting this will be helpful in trying to save you.= =Broadcasting this will be helpful in trying to save you.= -=Exclusive phone interview with survivor. News flash.=- The rescue work has already begun, but it may take a long time due to the size of the slide. =Do you have any food in there with you?= You said it may take a long time. What does that mean? =You mean the rescue team hasn't told you the plan?= Just how long a period of time are you talking about? They can't get me out of here immediately? =It seems they haven't explained the situation to you.= =They aren't sure about the Hado side,= =but the Seoul side has completely collapsed.= =The entrance is totally destroyed.= =Lee Jeong Su, what is your mood right now?= Hey! Where the hell is that call from? Hey! Where the hell is that call from? It seems like the staging area. It seems like the staging area. Then you should stop it, Kid! He'll deplete his battery. Hey, hey, hey you! Hurry and hang up the phone! If you keep this up, his phone will go dead! If you keep this up, his phone will go dead! But they're broadcasting live. It will end soon. Very soon. This guy is really pissing me off. Please go ahead. =Yes, Lee Jeong Su.= Hang that up right now! What do you think you're doing? What the hell are you all doing? The victim's phone has now been disconnected. =We will sort out the situation and report again.= Who the hell are you? You just screwed up a live broadcast! Did you not see the story that was just on the air? Reporters, right now is your story more important or is a life more important? What? You can't answer a simple question? If because of you, that person's phone battery goes dead, because of being isolated, he will become anxious with fast heartbeat and breathing difficulty! Because of inadequate oxygen, his blood flow will slow down! Due to long-term lack of energy his heart will stop beating! What then, Mr. Reporter? Will you take responsibility? That's for Lee Jeong Su... This is a lifeline! A lifeline! This is a lifeline! A lifeline! If you call him again, you will be in violation of article 18 of the media responsibility law. Please. Don't call him. Why is this van still parked here? Get it out of here! Right now! Hey! Why are you letting cars come in here? Can't you keep them out of here? Can't you even restrict access here? Our car shouldn't even be here! They didn't stop and just drove right through. Sang Hun. Yes. Charge this. Okay. Good job. It's true that knowledge is power. There was nothing they could say. What was that media law you just mentioned? Just something I threw out. It's not real? Those reporters didn't say anything. It looks like they weren't even sure about it. Kid, go check the rescue regulations. -=1. Definition of collapse.=- There aren't any instructions in here? It's in English and still being translated. Translate this into English and return it to them. Captain, Lee Jeong Su called. Hey, close them. Close them. Hello, Lee Jeong Su. I'm the rescue team captain, Kim Dae Gyeong. =Why do you never answer the phone?= What? =What are you all doing?= =Didn't you just say you would rescue me quickly?= =Is it different than that?= Lee Jeong Su, calm down and listen to me. =How can you tell me to calm down?= Hurry and explain this to me. What's going on out there now? Just tell me the truth! =Lee Jeong Su, if you're like this, I can't talk to you.= Hey, you son of a bitch! Then who can I talk to? =Then give someone else the phone! Let me talk to the person in charge!= Lee Jeong Su, I am the person in charge. You need to listen. Son of a bitch, then hurry up. =Lee Jeong Su, listen to what I say.= =First, Lee Jeong Su, you have to calm down.= I am... right now I'm calm. Just hurry and tell me. Then you need to do this. Lee Jeong Su, take a deep breath. Just follow me and take a deep breath. I'm already breathing so just tell me. =I'm sorry. I am the rescue leader, Kim Dae Gyeong.= Lee Jeong Su, how much charge is left on your phone battery? It's at 78%. Why? Why are you asking that? =Yes. Well, I'm going to tell you the truth now.= =First of all, this situation is not very simple.= =Of course, we will definitely rescue you.= But it's probably going to take some time is what I'm saying. The Minister wants to come. Minister? Lee Jeong Su, do you have any water in the car? Water or drinks, or any food? Hello? Hello? Lee Jeong Su? Come on, come on. Get it together. Lee Jeong Su, do you have any water? Water? Please answer me. Lee Jeong Su? I have 2 bottles of water and a cake. Okay. How many milliliters? They're small, 500 mL and a cream cake. The cake won't last a long time. You should probably eat that quickly. And the water, the water... That's very important. =I think you'll have to make it last about 7 days.= =Mark it. Be sure to drink as much as possible.= =And drink without it touching your lips,= =so the water won't become polluted.= Wait. =You understand, right?= So you mean, I'll have to be here for a week? You will be rescued before you drink all that water. Lee Jeong Su, you understand what I explained to you about the water, right? Don't touch my mouth. Divide it to last for one week. Very good. You remembered it correctly. Lee Jeong Su, do you happen to know your present position? In other words, about how far are you from the tunnel entrance? =This is very important for the rescue.= Oh, yes. I was quite far into it. There's a ventilation fan that fell on top of me. What? Ventilation fan? There's a fan on top of the car? Hey. Hurry and get the plans. Okay. A ventilation fan on the car is very important information. Go over there. Okay. We're looking at the diagrams, so hold on a moment. We have the plans now. You just tore them. =Look, there's no problem.= Could you see the exit when you entered the tunnel? =No. I couldn't see it.= Okay. =There isn't anything else?= I went around the bend. After that, I drove inside. I can't remember. Okay. Fine. Lee Jeong Su. From now on at 12:00, we'll contact you. But for today, turn your phone off immediately. Who did you say you are again? =Yes. Kim Dae Gyeong, rescue team leader.= Please tell me the truth. Can you save me? We have saved many people in this country. You'll be out of there very soon. You and I will meet on that day. Hey. Put it there. Geez. Five ventilation fans and Lee Jeong Su is under one of them. Five ventilation fans and Lee Jeong Su is under one of them. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Honey. Honey. =Honey, are you okay? Are you injured?= I'm okay. I'm really okay. I'll get out. They told me it will be about one week from now. Don't worry. Don't cry. I'll get out of here very soon. You should save your battery. Just talk to me for a minute. Su Jin. Does Su Jin know? I told her you were busy at work and couldn't come home. Do you want to talk to her? Yes. Put her on. Su Jin. Daddy bought your cake and was bringing it home. Su Jin. Daddy bought your cake and was bringing it home. But something happened and I can't come. I'm sorry. Daddy, I'm going to grandma's house. Can you come there? I want to get my cake and my the gift. My puppy. Right. Daddy will buy the puppy and then come. =Really? Mom! Daddy said he'll come after he buys the puppy!= =I'm taking Su Jin to my mom's house and then I'll come there.= No, no, no. Just stay there. =I'm coming.= Okay. The tunnel length is 1.9 km. Lee Jeong Su's position is in one of the 5 areas marked here. The lowest place is more than 100 meters deep and there are many rocks. So going from the south entrance seems the most effective method. After we confirm the situation tomorrow, we will decide whether we begin there. The implementation of rescue efforts should be discussed with experts. Everyone must treat this as if it were their own family, and put in their best effort. Also, there is construction nearby for a second Hado tunnel. That will be suspended for now. There's another tunnel here? Yes. It's currently under construction nearby. They were working on the final section. Will the second tunnel in the area also be affected? Because the opening of the new Hado city is not far away, it must be completed as soon as possible. Consult the experts and then get started. Let's do all that we can. Will that be enough now? Are there enough here now? Yes. Wait, wait, wait! We have to change cards. Just a moment. Such a headache. Here we go! The people in front, crouch down a bit. Get a bit lower. Crouch down a bit lower. You're blocking our view! Okay. Thank you! Let's go. Let's go. Okay. Send them in now! Send them! We don't want the drones to hit anyone! Please don't get too close! What the hell's going on? Okay. What? What happened? They lost the signal. It's not very far from here. They have a range of 5 km. If the signal is weak, then the range will be shorter. There must be a lot of iron ore in there. If wireless doesn't work, can't you use wired ones? This is the only type of device I have. But if you want to get through there, we have some at the factory. Okay. Then call a courier to deliver them quickly. What are you doing? Where's your factory? Ontario. In America. Aigoo. Hey. You stay here. Can you do it alone? Yes. The whole thing is collapsed. Your wife is on the phone! Tell her I'll call her back. And you, don't honk that horn. Got it? I'm sorry! Idiot. Has he gone crazy? What? Sorry, I pressed it by accident. Sorry. Captain! Lee Jeong Su is on the phone! Yes, Lee Jeong Su. Is there someone around here? =What?= I think I just heard a car horn honk twice. =Really?= Oh! I heard it again! Again! That... is me. He can hear that? I just heard the horn honk 5 times again. Yes, yes! Lee Jeong Su. We might see you sooner than we expected. =Really?= =Thank you! Thank you!= Lee Jeong Su, get down in your car immediately! =Protect yourself!= -=Hado Tunnel - Safe and Happy Construction=- -=Hado Tunnel - Safe and Happy Construction=- The phone! Phone! Phone! Captain! Captain! Captain, are you all right? Give me a phone! You can't come in! You can't! Hello? Lee Jeong Su! Can you hear me? Can you hear? I hear you. =Are you okay?= It collapsed a bit more, but I'm okay. There was just another major collapse at the entrance! =I'm sorry.= It says ventilation fan #3. =Number 3. Number 3.= Your wife... What did you say? =It looks like your wife has come here.= =Do you want to talk to her?= Yes. Put her on. Put her on. =Oppa, are you okay?= Did you have breakfast? You're asking me that now? =I'm really fine.= I'll call you again later. Remember to eat breakfast. Yesterday at 8:30 a.m., the rescue team was able to accurately locate Lee Jeong Su's position. From the surface, we plan to drill about 180 meters down, to open a rescue channel towards Lee Jeong Su. We also intend to enter from the south entrance. 1. Top (vertical) excavation. 2-Track method.

A lot of information is emerging regarding shoddy construction. Two-thirds of our 121 tunnels were recently inspected. More than 78 tunnels are not up to standards, which is causing widespread concern. More than 78 tunnels are not up to standards, which is causing widespread concern. During construction of a tunnel, in order to prevent the collapse of the rock, During construction of a tunnel, in order to prevent the collapse of the rock, During construction of a tunnel, in order to prevent the collapse of the rock, each section should have 10 anchor bolts.

That's just tempting fate, isn't that right? Didn't you say you'd rescue me before I drank all the water? =Yes. I'm sorry.= Truthfully, you can't do it, right? No. We will. I will get you out. Just wait a while longer. We will definitely get in there. =You're saving urine in the empty bottles, right?= Urine is sterile, so you can drink it. Did you drink it before? =I'm sorry. I never have.= -=9 days after collapse=- Go away, brat. What is that? Where did this come from? You ate my cake last time. Two for me. One for you. My nose is bigger than yours, so I get four. You get two. Understand? Okay, Tangie. Eat up. Eat. Eat. It's okay. Relax. It's okay. Relax. Your food needs seasoning. Don't look. Don't look. Don't look. Look away. Here it is. I absolutely won't let you open this. Should I take this off? Wow. This is something. Bad dog. Be still. It has a button. Is this nice? You need to learn to bury it like a cat does. Who do you think is going to clean up after you? Who will pick it up? There's no way I could drink your urine. Yes. How is the digging progressing? How is the digging progressing? =Because it's relatively hard, it's been going slowly.= =Within 10 days we should surely be through.= =Plus, we have to shore up the tunnel entrance properly.= =We should start digging today.= 22. 23. 24. 24. 10. Lee Jeong Su, I... drank urine. Why would you drink urine? I had never done it, so I felt bad telling you to do it. Also... don't drink it right away. Let it cool first. That helps. You've given me a lot of encouragement. Thank you. Do you want some? Tangie, this is orange juice. My body can squeeze out orange juice. That's weird, right? Honey, I found water. Drinking water. =It tasted sweet.= =Sweet water?= =Don't be worrying about me.= =You must eat properly, okay?= =Okay. I'll call you later.= Are you doing okay? I heard you drank urine. How much did you drink? Seriously, he shouldn't have told you. It was a paper cup. Not like this one... About the size of that one. Do you want a drink? Drink it yourself. =As our audience friends know,= =the only radio station Lee Jeong Su can receive= =in the tunnel is our station.= =If the rescue team loses contact with him before the rescue,= =we will broadcast at 12:00= =for 5 minutes to pass the rescue news to Lee Jeong Su.= =We hope everyone can understand.= This is the top of the tunnel structure. This is the top of the tunnel structure. It came out this morning. If we keep drilling overnight, It came out this morning. If we keep drilling overnight, we expect to reach the underground tunnel tomorrow. Lee Jeong Su will be out soon! Lee Jeong Su will be out soon! Lee Jeong Su will be out soon! Thank you. Thank you. -=Mom: Mom will be bringing Dad over there soon.=- -=Su Jin: And the puppy?=- Seonbae. We think it will be soon. Let's go. I guess I fell asleep. I'm so tired. Wow. That's too bad. One more day and he'd break the record. The last record was 17 days. Then Mr. Reporter, would you like to try for the record? Everyone move aside! How can you block this area? That guy is really... Why would we need to break the record? Who knows? Who knows? =Keep watching up above.= Okay. =If anything starts to come through,= =just get away quickly.= =just get away quickly.= =It's only 0.6 meter around, so you don't have to move much.= Thank you. Then I'll see you soon. It seems like it will come through here. We'll be out soon. Higher, higher, higher! This is a ventilation fan blade... and this is asphalt. Then we must be in the tunnel, right? That's right. We've reached the bottom. Don't speak too soon. But we found broken pieces of the ventilation fan. Bring over the blueprints. Yes, here we go. They're acting kind of strange. Look and see what's going on. Lee Jeong Su, did you... see the drill come through? I didn't see it. Are the 2 ventilation fans still intact? Yes. Why? After I confirm things, I'll call you back. Wait! What is this? This film was taken when the tunnel was opened. Watch. There are several fans showing. There should be 7. One is missing. How is that possible? There are six. Six. Damn it! This is worthless! Worthless! Check it again. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six... We thought there were 7, so we thought No. 3 was right here. Actually, it's here. Then these blueprints are wrong? Does that make any sense? It doesn't. Captain, the fan installation master said there should be 12. The team installed one for every two, in 6 places. It was the wrong place. Really? Yes. You mean they worked 17 days for nothing? Isn't that Lee Jeong Su's wife? So how far is it from Lee Jeong Su now? About 150 meters. He won't be able to move that far. Then, we're going to have to drill again? When will you get through? =I'm sorry.= What? =We drilled in the wrong place.= What do you mean by that? We got the wrong location and drilled in the wrong place. How can it be wrong? =I'm really sorry.= If that's the case, then what should I do? =First, we will restart the tunnel intersection project.= And then? =We'll start drilling all over again.= Starting over? =We will go as fast as we can.= =Oppa, are you okay?= Oppa. What's wrong? I can't breathe. Try to calm down and I'll find a doctor. I need some help here! He's acting strange. Hurry! No, no, no. My battery is going. Se Hyeon, this is my last call. Se Hyeon, my battery is dead. =Give the phone to Su Jin.= =Give the phone to Su Jin.= Oppa, Su Jin isn't here. Oppa! Oppa, be strong. I can't stay here. I can't stay here. =Oppa!= Se Hyeon, I can't hold on. =You have to stay strong, Oppa!= =Just hold on.= Why do you keep telling me to be strong? I said I can't do it. Honey. Hello? Hello? Tell me. Tell me, Oppa. Take good care of Su Jin and live your life well. What are you saying? Se Hyeon, I'm sorry. I just can't go on. I really can't go on. Is that so? Then just do that. Just go ahead and die. Die! But... if you die, Su Jin and I will die too! Oppa, if you die then all of us will die! Understand? I'm not threatening you. =Otherwise, just keep going.= Don't talk about dying or things like that, okay? You have to keep holding on. You have to live. Please just live, okay? Please! What now? What now? Madam! Hey! Hurry, hurry! Call an ambulance! I'm asking why the snow blowers aren't here yet! =Right now they're cleaning roads in town.= We don't have any extra machines to send there. Shouldn't this place be top priority? There have been more than 50 car accidents in the past 2 days. There was a fatal accident yesterday. We're really too busy to die. I know this isn't good to say, =but isn't it only one person?= That person... that one person... is still alive! Do you know how long he's been waiting? Chief, I'm begging you. Please send us one snow- blowing machine! Is Lee Jeong Su is still alive? The miners in Chile were rescued on the 69th day. =23 days after collapse= The miners in Chile were rescued on the 69th day. =23 days after collapse= But that involved 33 people. =23 days after collapse= Additionally, their food supply was not a problem. Additionally, their food supply was not a problem. In a case like this without any food, the longest record of survival is 19 days. And with the extremely disturbing cold, on top of any injuries, it would be even more difficult, right? I can see that you're pessimistic, right? There are always variables, so we can't jump to conclusions. Yes. Today, is Lee Jeong Su's 23rd day of isolation. Contact was lost one week ago. During this time, we don't know what might have happened to Lee Jeong Su. We should not be too hasty in coming to conclusions, and consider carefully. We are more willing to believe in hope rather than statistics. =This is a letter from Lee Jeong Su's wife.= ="Recently, Su Jin said living is too hard."= ="Why would Su Jin say such a thing at her age?"= ="She doesn't like studying in kindergarten."= ="Learning addition and subtraction is too hard?"= ="It seems she might be good at your major in liberal arts."= ="Today she said her happiest time was when she was inside my tummy."= ="I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when she said she wanted to get back inside..."= ="...but she had gotten too big..."= =Today, we're going to play a song that's not usual for our station.= =Classical music fans may be surprised, but please forgive us.= =Lee Jeong Su, please listen.= From here on, the tunnel intersection rescue work, how is it progressing? We are about 200 meters away from Lee Jeong Su's location. If we go forward 15 meters a day, we will reach him in 15 days. After the failure of vertical drilling at nearly 9 days from the south... Why did they call us here? What are they doing? The 2nd tunnel project has been stalled for nearly 25 days. Every day we're losing about $1.5 million. Our loss to date has exceeded $50 million. Why are you unable to proceed with the 2nd tunnel? We need to do blasting with dynamite, so it's possible Lee Jeong Su's location would be impacted. Then, how much longer do we have to wait? Honestly, I came here today just to look you all in the eyes. Last time, because of a lizard, you must remember how the tunneling was interrupted. Do you know how much damage was done to the national economy? Just because of some lizard? Hey. Excuse me, but Lee Jeong Su is not a lizard. He's a person. Right now, trapped in that tunnel is not a reptile. It's a person. A person. I didn't mean anything by what I said. Yes. Although that's how it is, I feel like you keep forgetting this fact. Right now, a person is trapped in there. A person. Go rest! I'll do it. How must longer are we doing this? I know. What is all this just to dig out a corpse? Hey, how can you say something like that? Everyone keeps saying there's no hope. They all think it but don't say it. Honestly, team leader, that's what you think too, isn't it? No. Quit saying that kind of thing. Go back to work. Yes, yes. Team leader! Team leader! Minister, someone was just killed at the rescue site. See? I knew that would happen. Mom, she's wearing you out, right? I'm sorry. =Just worry about taking care of yourself.= =Have you eaten?= I can still eat. Did Su Jin stay home from school? =Yes.= Why? =Well...= What? The children heard what their mothers have said, and said something to Su Jin. What did they say? =That because of Su Jin's father, other people were suffering.= =I was really speechless.= =So I could only say one word to them.= =Mom, keep Su Jin home from school,= =until I come back.= Because of you, my son has passed away. Because of you, my son is dead! Just to look for your husband's corpse, my healthy son has died! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -=Resumption of 2nd Hado Tunnel project approved by 65%.=- -=Consent to restart 2nd Hado Tunnel project=- We understand it's very difficult. But the longer this drags on, our situation also becomes more difficult. The country also feels it's time to stop. More than 65% do. Everyone is exhausted. If you keep insisting they continue, and someone else gets hurt, what will you do then? It's time that you face reality. But... Please go ahead. If my husband is still alive, then what? Wouldn't you feel sorry to him? Stop work! =Oppa. Oppa, are you listening?= =It's Se Hyeon.= =I don't know if you can still hear me or not.= =It must be very cold.= You must be hungry. I went to sign papers today. There's a second tunnel nearby. I signed the consent for them to start work again. They're going to stop... trying to save you. =Everyone has to leave now.= =The rescue effort is over.= =Stop waiting.= =Nobody will be coming.= =I know I shouldn't say that.= =I'm sorry.= =It's a terrible thing to have to say.= Maybe... Maybe you're not still waiting. I was afraid you might keep waiting for us and not leave. I'm sorry, Oppa. =But are you still alive?= The people here have said you couldn't still be in this world. They say that you're dead. =I'm sorry, Oppa.= But if you're listening to me right now, what will we do? Oppa, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry, Oppa. Oppa. Jeong Su oppa. I'm sorry. What should I do? They can't. I'm still alive. I'm alive. After an interruption of 27 days due to rescue efforts for Lee Jeong Su, After an interruption of 27 days due to rescue efforts for Lee Jeong Su, the second Hado Tunnel project will be restarting today. After completion of the 2nd tunnel, the drive from Hado to Seoul will be less than 40 minutes. Captain, if you take this upon yourself, I'll get fired. The channel has been in there too long. It might be bent or even have a crack. This is very dangerous, Captain. You don't have to do this. I told him to wait. I would be despicable if I just walked away now. Whether he's alive or dead, I have to be sure. Send me down. Stay in contact with us. If anything goes wrong, I'm pulling you up immediately. Okay. =You'll be there soon.= =There may be some vibrations.= =Hold on tightly.= You could have told me sooner. Drilling leader! Who is it? Did they go down? He wanted to make a final confirmation. Pull him back up right now! They're about to start blasting! =Captain. Captain?= Drilling leader, don't talk to me. It's too noisy. =I'm sorry, but you have to come up right now.= Wait! Just give me 5 minutes! =Close the door. I'm pulling you up right now.= Lee Jeong Su! Lee Jeong Su! Lee Jeong Su! Is it all clear now? Do you know how expensive this is? There are only a few of these in the country! That's enough already! You should just care more about the equipment. Wait! Why? Stop! Stop working! Nobody move! Don't you move! Don't move! Don't move! Stop! There's movement! Demolition team! Demolition team! Stop blasting! Stop blasting! Lee Jeong Su is still alive! Lee Jeong Su is still alive! Stop blasting! Lee Jeong Su is still alive! -=35 days after collapse=- Captain, over there. He's coming out! Lee Jeong Su, how are you feeling? Please clear the way! I'm sorry! Please move aside! Clear the way! Move aside! Hey. Why aren't we going? They want us to wait a moment. Who said that? Why? Just a moment. The Minister is coming. Wait a moment longer before you go. Wait a moment longer before you go. Are you out of your mind? Take it up with the Department. She's here right now. Minister, please say something! Wait! It looks like Lee Jeong Su is saying something! What are his first words after coming back into the world? What did he say? Please tell us what he said! We can't hear you! Say it louder! Okay. "Tell those sons of bitches to get lost!" That's what he said. Okay. Take him away. Lift. 1. 2. 3. Who did he mean? Me? Why? After being buried for 35 days, Lee Jeong Su has come back safely. For a person buried alone, this has special significance as the world's record. But before we rejoice, there were some big problems with the rescue efforts.

How can you park your car here? I should not have used profanity, as it undermines the reputation of civil servants. Why should I have to write this? They asked me what he said and I just told them. So why should I have to write a letter of apology? They all deserved it anyway. Shostakovich. =We were just listening to Shostakovich.= =Violin Concerto No. 1.= If I had stayed any longer, I could have written a symphony. =He's finally going home after a long time.= =We hope he can finally eat and make up for everything he missed.= =Su Jin, you must go to bed early tonight.= =Lee Jeong Su, to help your strength today,= =we will play an energizing song for you.= This guy is too funny.
