Why... wants to build more cottages. Wants every cottage he can get for his workmen. Always work. They simply spoil the place. You going to take the same attitude as your people? What attitude? Oh, this high and mighty we've-owned-the-land- forever business. It is rather snobbish, you know. Do you know your mother hasn't even called our clan? Mmm, I know. I'm awfully sorry. I know she ought to call. My brother Charlie and she don't like it, nor does my father, I can tell you. Mr. Hornblower never to have found that land without those works. Oh, that's rather dog in the manger. No. I like you, but I don't like him, and I don't like his works. You might realize that we've been here since elizabeth and rather naturally love the place. And can't bear to see it being spoiled. Well, you call it spoiling; we call it progress. My father's a very clever man, you know. He's just as human as yours. Since mother died, he's been absolutely wrapped up in us. All this getting on is for us. He thinks he's entitled to a little influence here, and you and the girls try to stop him. You ought to be just, Jill. I am just, and I want awfully to be on good terms. And... he's so pushy. You won't let it come between us, will you? I don't know. I hate it, too, but I don't know. Oh, well, I must be getting along. Good-bye. Good-bye. See you soon, I hope. Take them sheep out of the road, will you? Take them away! Come down here, and I'll tell you what I'll do to you in about half... I keep on telling you, it's no good, sir. I'm sorry, but I want the cottages. You'll have to clear out. Mr. Hornblower, I'm sure mr. Hillcrist would never have turned us out. Oh, mr. Hillcrist be damned. Sir, mr. Hillcrist told us when he sold the land to you that it was on condition that we and the others shouldn't be turned out. Yes, well, I didn't think I'd need the cottages then, but now, I must have them for my workmen. I've got important works, you know. Well, look here now. I don't want to be hard on you I'll give you 5 to cover the whole thing. We wouldn't take 50. Why, we've brought up 3 children here, and I've buried 2. We're very attached to it, you see, sir. Yes, I... well, look here, now. I'll give you 10, eh? Here, I'll send a wagon to ship your things. Here, here, if that isn't fair, hmm? Hmm? Well, you better accept. I shan't keep it open. Won't take it. Not a farthing. Why, we come here when we was married. Well, I was going to give you another week, but now you'll go out next saturday. All right? Now, take care you're not late, or your things will be pulled out in the rain. You're no gentleman. Don't put temptation in my way, that's all. Yes, and you can tell your fine friend Hillcrist what's happening anyway, I'll soon let him know. Here's your hat. We'll go right on up and see the squire now. When I sold Longmeadow and the cottages to Hornblower, it was on the distinct understanding that there was to be no disturbance of tenancy. He's no gentleman, sir. He put it so brisk. We've been there 30 years. So now we don't know what to do. I hope you'll excuse us coming round, sir. I should think so, indeed. I certainly would never have sold if I had known he was going to do this. They talk about his having bought the centry, sir, to put up more chimneys there. That's why he want s the cottages. Centry? Impossible. Yes, sir. It's such a pretty spot. It looks beautiful from here. Loveliest spot in all deepwater, I always say. And your father owned it and his father before him. I hope you're going to stop it, sir. It does put us about. I said to Jackie, mr. Hillcrist will stand up for us, I know. You leave it to me, mrs. Jackman, will you? Good morning. Good morning, Jackman. Good morning, then good morning, sir. Good morning, and thank you kindly. Good morning. Fellowes! Is mrs. Hillcrist about, fellowes? She was in the garden with mr. Dawker, sir, but I think she's come in since and gone in to the study. Oh... look, look, what a nice coat he has. Are you very busy for a moment? Is it anything important? All right, we'll leave the question of showing for a moment. I'll see you later don't go, Dawker. This has something to do with you. The Jackmans have been turned out of their cottage by Hornblower. Oh! You remember when I sold, I stipulated they were not to be. They've been there I won't have it! It's a breach of faith. Do you suppose this Hornblower would care 2 straws about that, Jack? He must! When it's put to him if he's any decent feeling. He hadn't. The Jackmans talk about his having bought the centry to put up more chimneys. What? Impossible. It could ruin the place utterly, besides cutting us off from the dukes. Oh, no. Miss Mullins would never sell behind our backs. Well, I must see that he... I must stop his turning these people out. What do you think about it, Dawker? Smart man, Hornblower. Never lets the grass grow. Smart! Don't underrate his ego, sir. Cad, I called him. am. That's right, ma' with all the advantages. But miss Mullins would never sell the centry, would she, Dawker? I heard she wants to, and Hornblower won't stick at the price, sir. What's it worth, Dawker? All depends what you want it for, ma'am he wants it for spite. We want it for sentiment. It's worth what you'd like to get for it, and he's a rich man. You give me your figure, sir. I'll try the old lady before he gets her. Better let Dawker make sure, Jack. Jackman tells me this Hornblower is coming to see me. I'll put it to him. Make him all the keener, sir. Better get in first. Ape his methods? Dawker. Go and see miss Mullins now. We leave it to you to do the best you can. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Hornblower, sir. Good morning. Morning. Morning. A fine morning. Lovely weather. Haven't seen you for a long time, Hillcrist. Not since I sold you Longmeadow and the cottages, I believe. That's just what I've come about. Forgive me, won't you sit down? What have you got, gout? Oh, that's unfortunate I never get it. I have no disposition that way. Had no ancestors, you see. Just me own drinking to answer for. You're lucky. I wonder if mrs. Hillcrist thinks that. Am I lucky to have no past, ma'am, just the future? You're quite sure you have the future, mr. Hornblower? Oh, yes, I've got the future, all right. I've had the Jackmans here, mr. Hornblower. Oh, man with the little spitfire wife? They're very excellent, good people, and they've lived quietly in that cottage for 30 years. Now you wanted me to stir you up a bit. You know, deepwater needs a bit of gold put into it. There's generally some gold where I am. I daresay you wish there's been no... We certainly like people to keep their word, mr. Hornblower. Amy. Never mind, Hillcrist. Takes more than that to upset me. You promised me, you know, not to disturb the tenancies. Yes, well, I've come to tell you that I've got to. I wasn't expecting to have the need when I bought. I thought the duke would sell me a bit down there, but devil if he will. And now I must have those cottages for my workmen. I've got important works, you know. The Jackmans have their importance, too, sir. Their heart's in that cottage. Well, if you think so much of these Jackmans, why not build them a cottage yourselves? You've got the space. That's beside the point. You promised me, and I sold on that understanding. I bought on the understanding I'd get some more land from the dukes. That's nothing to do with me. Ah, you'll find that it has, 'cause I'm going to have those cottages. Well, I call it simply... now, now, look here, Hillcrist. You've not had occasion to understand men like me. I've got the guts, and I've got the money and I don't sit still on it. I'm going ahead becaus e I believe in meself. I've no use for sentiment, that sort of thing. Why, 40 of your Jackmans aren't worth me little finger. Of all the blatant things I ever heard said... well, as we are speaking plainly... I've been thinking you want the village run your old-fashioned way, and I want it run mine. I'll fancy there's not room for the two of us here. When are you going? Oh, never fear. I'm not going. I'm told that you wish to buy the centry and put up some more of your chimneys there, regardless of the fact that you'd utterly ruin a house we've had for generations and all of our pleasure here. Oh ho! Is it true about the centry? Gospel true. Well, if you want to know, my son Charlie is buying it this very minute. Ah, he's with the old lady. She wants to sell. And she'll get her price, whatever it is. If this isn't a skin game, mr. Hornblower, I don't know what is. Oh! Huh! You've got a very nice expression there. Skin game. Well, bad words break no bones, and they're wonderful for hardening the heart. If it wasn't for a lady's presence, I could give you a specimen or two. That needn't stop you, I'm sure, mr. Hornblower. Oh, and I don't know that it need. You're an obstruction, the likes of you. You're in my path. G. And anyone in my path doesn't stay there lon or if he does, he stays there on my terms, and my terms are chimneys in the centry, where I need them. It'll do you a power of good to know that you're not almighty. This is being neighborly? And how have you tried being neighborly to me? Eh? If I haven't a wife, I've got a daughter-in-law have you called on her, ma'am? No. No, I'm new, and you're an old family. You don't like me. You think I'm a pushy man. I go to chapel, and you don't like that. I make things and I sell them. You don't like that. I buy land, and you don't like that. It threatens the view from your windows. Well, I don't like you, and I don't want to put up with your attitude. You've had things your own way too long, and now you're not gonna have them any longer. That's a declaration of war. Oh ho ho! Now, look here, Hillcrist. I don't object to you personally. You seem to me a poor sort of creature that's bound to get left with your gout and your dignity. But of course, you can make yourself pretty disagreeable before you're done. Now I want to be the moving spirit here. I'm full of plans. I'm gonna stand for parliament. I'm gonna make this a prosperous place. I'm a good-natured man if you'll treat me as such. Now, you take me on as a neighbor... and all that, and I'll manage withou t chimneys in the centry. Here, is it a bargain? Not if you'd bought the centry 10 times over. Your ways are not mine. I'll have nothing to do with you. Really? Is that so? Very well. Now you are going to learn some things, and it's time you did. Do you realize that I'm very nearly around you? Eh? I'm at... up hill. The works are here. Here's Longmeadow. Here's the centry, that I've just bought. So my goods will be running right round you. How will you like that for a country place? Eh? That's not a bit sporting of you, mr. Hornblower. Well... you should hear both sides before you say that, missy. There isn't anothe r side to turning out the Jackmans after you promised... oh, dear me, yes. Why, they don't matter a row of gingerbread compared to the schemes I've got for bettering this neighborhood. I had been standing up for you. Now I won't. Oh, dear, dear. What'll become of me, eh? I won't say anything about the other thing, because I think it's beneath dignity to notice it, but to turn poor people out of their cottage is a shame. Hoity me! Jill! Well, what's the good? Life's too short for rows. Now, now, look here. You'll just have to learn that a man who's worked as I have, risen as I have, and who knows the world is the proper judge of what's right and wrong. I'll answer to god for my actions, not to you, young lady. Poor god! You blasphemous young thing. Jill, I wish you'd kindly not talk. Oh. I don't think I want to say anything more to you, Hornblower. Good morning. All right. We'll play what you call a skin game, Hillcrist, without gloves on. We won't spare each other. You look out for yourselves. By god, after this morning, I mean business. Where's my hat? Good-bye. Say that I'm here, will you? Dawker, sir. Well... Dawker? Safe, for the moment. The old lady will put it up to auction. Couldn't get her to budge from that. Said she didn't want to be unneighborly. Ask me, it's money she smells. Can I see you alone for a moment, please, ma'am? It's rather important. In the study, Dawker. I bet Dawker's up to no good. I can tell by his expression. I don't like Dawker, father. He's so common. My dear, we can't all be uncommon. And he's got lots of dough. I bet they've got some scheme on that'll make you do things you don't approve of if you don't look out. Mother's fearfully bitter when she gets her knife in. If old Hornblower' s disgusting, there's no reason why we should be. So you think I'm capable? That's nice, Jill. No, no, darling. But I want to warn you solemnly ir that mother would tell you you're fighting fa no matter what she and Dawker do. Jill, I never saw you so serious. Well... hey! Sorry. I was just beginning to enjoy myself, now everything's going to be bitter and beastly with mother in that mood. That horrible old man. Oh, daddy, I... don't let them make you horrid. You're such a darling. How's your gout, ducky? Better, a lot better. There, you see? That shows. It's going to be half interesting for you, not for us. Look here, Jill, is there anything between you and this young what's-his-name Rolf? No, but... now it's all spoiled. You don't expect me to regret that. I don't mean any tosh about love's young dream, but I do like being friends. I want to enjoy things, and you can't do that when everybody's on the hate. You're going to wallow in it. So shall I. Oh, I know I shall. We shall all wallow and think of nothing but one for his nob. Aren't you fond of your home? Of course. I love it. Well, you won't be abl e to live here unless we stop that ruffian. Imagine it. Chimneys and smoke, all the trees cut down, piles of pots all over the place. You know, I was born here and my father and his and his. They loved those fields and the old trees. Do you know I learned to ride in the centry meadows? Prettiest spring meadows in the world. You may go through life and never find anything so good and beautiful as this old home, and I'm not going to have it spoiled without a fight. I told you! I knew perfectly well what he told me... Well, lad, how are you? Hey, dad! Ah, love. Not much, are they? I'll just get the. I say, do you see old Hornblower and his son Charlie? Oh, look. There's Chloe. You know, Charlie's wife standing with Rolf. I say, Rolf, just leave me alone for a moment, would you? What? All right. What did that woman mean by insulting you like that? I'll make them pay for it. Wonderful improvement we're having in the town, ma'am. I did hear we're having the electric lights soon. Mrs. Hillcrist. I beg your pardon? Mrs. Hillcrist, I... well? I haven't done you any harm. Did I ever say you had? No, but you act as though I had. I'm not aware that I acted at all... as yet. You're nothing to me except as one of your family. It isn't as if I want to spoil your home. Stop them, then. I see your husband out there with his father. I'll try. I suppose such men pay no attention to what women are. I'm fond of my husband I don't quite know why you spoke to me. I only thought you might like to treat me as a human being. Really, I... I'd rather you left me alone just now, if you don't mind. Very well. I'll move further up. Excuse me. Get up, Dawker. In case I don't see the squire, would you ask him when I come to his limit, blow his nose if he wants me to go on. And when he blows the second time, I'll stop for good what limit did you settle? 6,000. That's a fearful price. From the ground... from the ground, you see that chap I told you about come down from town. He's a fellow who can tell us all about young mrs. H. Watch me cross over, you'll see me stand beside him. Hello. Jack, I've just seen Dawker. He says if you want to go about 6,000, blow your nose once. When you blow it the second time, he'll take it as a signal to stop bidding altogether. I see. I say, look. Jack, go and offer her my smelling salts. Thank god for human touch. I say, have a sniff. You look awfully white. No, I'm all right. Thank you. No, no, do. You must. I'll get you some water. Now, you know, I've only one property to sell. That very desirable corn and stock-rearing and parklike residential land known as the, uh, centry, deepwater. Unique property. An a-1 chance to an a-1 audience. Mister... you won't mind listening to the conditions. Mr. Brinker will read them, and they won't worry you, I'm sure. Very short. Speak up! Now, gentlemen, it's not often a piece of land like this comes into the market. No better land in deepwater. No better land in deepwater. That's right, mr. Spicer. I know the village well, and a charming place it is. Perfect locality, to be sure. Well, I'm not gonna waste your time by singing the praises of this property. There it is, well-watered, nicely timbered, no reservation of timber. Gentlemen, no tenancy to hold you up, free to do what you like with it tomorrow. And you've got a jewel of a site there, too. Perfect position for a house. Lies between the dukes and squire Hillcrist's. An emerald isle. No allusion to our ireland gentlemen. Perfect peace in the centry. Nothing like it in the county. Carries the mineral rights, and as you know, perhaps, there's a very valuabl e deepwater clay there. Well, now... What shall I start it at? A gentleman site, a gentlemen site. You don't have that given you every day. I'm not particular. Anything you'd like to give me come on, you've got more time than me, I expect. Come on. grazing and corn land. And a site for a residence unequaled in the county. Now, then. Now, then. What shall I say? Think of all the possibilities. What shall I say? hurt you, mr. Spiza. Why, it's worth that to overlook the duke. For 2,000. for 2,000. Mr. Sammy, don't scratch your head over it. desirable property. Why, you'd think it wasn't desirable. gentlemen. A little spirit. For 3,500. May I say 4? Take hundred? I'm not particular. I'll take hundreds. 3,600. Uh, 700. Come on, gentlemen, I don't want to wait all day. I don't want to wait all day. Now we're beginning. And one, and two. And 3. May I... and 4 and 5, and 6. And 7. 8. 9, may I say? 9. There's more spirit in that, gentlemen. More spirit. 5,000. Dada, why can' t I see the bids? That last was Hornblower. Now, gentlemen, I'm not going to give this property away. And one, and two, and 3. And 5 did you say, sir? Who was that, dada? Hornblower. It's the duke agent in the center. Yes, but... shh. Shh. Now, this chance may never come again. As the poet says, how we regret it if we don't get it. Now, may I say 5,600? Well, we're getting on. But we haven't reached the value yet. For 5,800. now, come on, gentlemen. Come along. We're not beaten. For 6,000. the centry. Finest spot in the county. the low price of 6,000. Come gentlemen, we haven't dried up. A little spirit. For 6,000. Very well. I'm selling. We've got it! And one, sir? Blow your nose, Jack. If it goes over 7,000, I don't know if we can't stand it. And two, thank you. For 6,000... and 3. For 6,300. And 4? For 6,400? This coveted property. For 6,400. Why, it's giving it away, gentlemen. And 6. and 7. and 8. For 6,800. for 6,800. Once, twice. For the last time, this dominating site. Thank you, mr. Hornblower. For 6,900. Don't blow your nose again, Jack. That's the signal for Dawker to give in. Don't do it yet. once, twice... and one. Thank you, sir. What about you, sir? Gentlemen, I have a bid for $7,100 for the centry. I'm instructed to take it if I can't get more. It's a fair price. It's not a big price. Sunken price. Sunken price? Well, you ought to know about sunken, I admit. Now, I suppose someone will offer $7,200. No one? Well, I can't make you, gentlemen. Well, to mr. Hornblower, for 7,100. Once, twice... Two! And two. Thank you, sir. May I have yours, sir? And 3. And 4. And 5 and 6. 7,600. and 3 and 4 and 5. May I have yours sir? 8! Once, twice... for the third and last time... And 500. For 9,500. May I have yours, sir? Was that the duke's agent who made that last bid? Thank god that stopped Hornblower, anyway. For 9,500. once more. The centry, deepwater, for 9,500. Once, twice... for the last time at 9,500. Mr. Smalley. Well, that's that! No more today, gentlemen. I say, do you see Chloe sitting down? She looks awfully queer. I think it's something to do with that man who was with Dawker. Well, we'd better get on. There's someone to look after her. All right. I say, Charles Hornblower doesn't seem very upset. Phew! Well, ha ha. You ran me up a pretty price. That's a bit very good, Hillcrist. But you didn't quite get my million. Ha ha. It's just my 9,000 that you kept. Thank god the centry's gone to a gentleman. Ha! The duke! Nah. The centry's not gone to a gentleman, nor to a fool. It's gone to me. What? I'm sorry for you. You're not fit to manage these things. Well, it's a monstrous price, and I've had to pay it because of your obstinacy. I shan't forget that when I come to bill. You mean to say that last bid was for you? Well, of course I do. I told you I was a bad man to be up against. Perhaps you believe me now. A trick! Trick? You had an agent bid for you. I had an agent bid for me. Only your agent bid at the beginning, and mine bid at the end. What's the trick in that, eh? Hmm. What did you call it? A skin game? Remember, we're playing a skin game. If we were younger men... aw, it wouldn't look pretty for us to be at fisticuffs. We'll leave the fighting for the young ones. And as for you, missy, you leave my boy alone. Dada... may I spit it his eye or something? You won this round, sir, by a foul blow. We'll see who can take advantage of it. I believe the law can stop your ruining my property. Mr. Hornblower? Will you fight foul, so shall we. We will not be foul played towards you and yours. You're outside the pale. Well, as we're speaking out, ma'am, it's your behavior to my daughter-in-law, who's as good as you and better to my way of thinking, that's more than half the reason why I bought this property. You fair got my dander up. It's no use to bandy words. Mr. Hornblower, if you build... you know, it's laughable. You make me pay $9,500 for a bit of land not worth 4, and you think I'm not going to get back on me? Why, I'm going on with as little consideration as if you were a family of black beetles. Good afternoon. All right, drive on. No, stop! There's something on? That man and Dawker know something about Chloe, I'm sure of it. And mother's in the secret, too. What did you ask Dawker, dada? Dawker! What's this mystery about young mrs. Hornblower? No mystery, sir. What is it? Better not ask in front of Jill. Oh, nonsense. It's not for a girl to hear. What load of rot! I read the papers every day. No worse to see in there anyway. Do you want your daughter... you think I was mother at my age. I was not so proud of my knowledge. No, but you had it. Now, what is it? What is it? Come here a minute, Dawker. Well, whatever it is about Chloe, I'm sorry for her. How do you know this? My friend over there is one of the agents, sir. Shocking. I'm sorr y I heard it. I told you not to. Tell your friend to come here. Are you sure of what you said? Perfectly. I remember her quite well. Her name then was... I don't want to know, thank you. It's not to be spoken of. It will not be spoken of that mr. Hornblower is wise. He is not wise? It must be spoken of. I say no, Amy. I won't have it. To use a piece of knowledge about a woman? It's repugnant. I won't do it. If you had a son tricked into marrying such a woman, would you wish to remain ignorant of it? I don't know. I don't know. You realize... that an implication of this kind may be grounds for a criminal libel action. Quite. There's not a shadow of doubt. Not the faintest. You saw her just now. Yes. I did. I don't like it. I don't like it at all. Good day. Chloe! Chloe! Chloe. Oh, mr. Hornblower is looking for you, madam. Shall I tell... I'll tell mr. Hornblow er you're down. How's the head oh, beastly, thanks. I say, let's go in the study for a minute. I've got Dawker waitin g by the garage now. He says he can only stay a few minutes. I say, are you sure it's all right? You don't want this quarrel with Hillcrist to go on, do you, Rolf? No, I hate it. Well, I think perhaps I can stop it. That's why... Hello. What you doing in here, eh? How're you feeling , Chloe? Oh, awful head. Have you? Hey, I'm sorry. Can you tend a moment? I've had a note from that woman. Well, what's the meaning of it, eh? Is it sheer impudence or lunacy or what? I don't know. G, oh, now, Chloe. If there's anythin you better tell me. Forewarned is forearmed, you know. There's nothing... Sorry. Unless it's that my father was a bankrupt. Ha! Well, many a man has been that. You've never told us much about your family. It's just... I wasn't very proud of them. Hmm? What were you going to say, Rolf? Oh, nothing. Oh. Well, you're n ot responsible for your father, hmm? No. No, if that's the one, it's a relief oh, the bitter snobs. I'll remember it in the account I've got with them don't say anything to Charlie. Do not worry him for nothing. Oh, no, no, no. I'll not. Ha! Why, if I went bankrupt, it'd upset Charlie , I'd never doubt. Now, there's nothi ng else before I answer her, hmm? You sure? She might invent things, of course. Ah, but there's a such thing as the laws of slander. If they play pranks, I'll have them up for it. There's dinner. Come on. No, I don't think I'll go in to dinner. My head's terrible. Is it? Aw. I'll just go into the garden for a bit and then have a liedown. Why are you going that way? Oh, I'm all right. Are you? Are you sure? Yeah? Shall we send you something up from dinner? No? All right. Good night, Chloe. Good night, dad. I'll tell Charlie where you are. Well, ma'am, what do want with me? Wait a moment. I'll stop that dog barking. Here, lie down. Lie down. You're making a mistake, you know. No. I have a good memory for faces. If that's all, you needn't have told me to come. Oh, don't go. You are playing a game with me. Aren't you ashamed? What harm have I done you? You call this cricket? No, my girl. Business. What have I to do with this quarrel? I couldn't help their falling out. It's your misfortune. You're a rotter if you can spoil anyone's life who never did you an ounce of harm. Oh, so they don't know about you, eh? Well, that's all right. now, look here, mrs. Chloe. I serve my employer, but I'm flesh and blood, too. And I give as good as I get. I hate this family of yours. There's no name too bad for them to call me this last week, no looks too bad to give me. I tell you frankly, I hate them. There's good in them, same as in you. Ah, there's no good Hornblower but a dead Hornblower. But I'm not one? No, but you'll be the mother of some, I shouldn't wonder. Oh, leave me alone, do? I'm happy here. Be a sport. Oh, be a sport. You can't get round me , so don't try to. Oh, it's such a bad time in the old days. Oh, do. You might. You've been fond of some woman, I suppose. Think of her. Now, look here, mrs. Chloe. You're only a small fry in this game, u. But I've got to use yo look here. Don't you make an enemy of me. I haven't been dragged through hell for nothing. Women like me can fight, I can tell you. Ah, that's better. I'd rather have a woman threaten than whine any day. Go on, threaten away. Look, there's some money. It's all I've got. Take it and drop me out, won't you? Won't you? You mistake your man, missy. Don't you try those games on with me. Oh, you're a beast. A beast. A cruel, cowardly beast. And how dare you bribe my man to spy on me. Oh, yes, you do. You know you do. If you drove me mad, you wouldn't care, you beast. Don't carry on. It won 't get you anywhere. I hope your mother and your sisters if you have any are going through what I've been going through ever since you got on my track. I hope they'll know what fear means. I hope they'll love and find it's hanging on a thread. Oh, you coward. You bastard. You coward. Calling yourself a man. Oh, you're quite pretty like that. You're a handsome woma n when you're aroused. Is there anything you'll take not to mess up my life? Now, look here, mrs. Chloe. I've got to go through with this. I don't want anything you can give me, but I'll let you down as lightly as I can. Chloe! Hello, Chloe. What are you doing here? I've been looking for you all over the place. I thought I heard someone talking. No. I think I'll go to my room now and have a liedown. My head's splitting. Aye, sure. It's damn cold out here. Come on, love. I say, what, uh... what gives you these heads? Hmm? You've been having the m for nearly a month now. I don't know. Except that I am going to have a child, Charlie. What? Are you glad? Of course. I mean, I suppose I am. It seems funny, somehow, you would be having a kid. The governor will be mighty pleased, anyway. Oh, don't tell him yet. All right, poor old girl. I saw you not well. Kiss, kiss. You're like fire. Are you all right? Oh, not so bad. Are you happy with me, Charlie? What do you think? You wouldn't easily believe things against me, would you? Oh, you're thinking of those Hillcrists again. What the hell that woman means by her attitude towards you, I... when I saw her there today, I had all my work out but to give her a bit of my mind. This quarrel's getting on my nerves. Yes, and we won't forget. We'll make them pay for it. Oh! I didn't mean that can't you get your father to stop it, Charlie? Whatever for? Now, look here, Chloe. Here, do this. What's behind all this? What do you mean? You're carrying on as if you were really scared. Here, come sit down. I tell you, we've got these people. Why, they'll have them out of deepwater in 6 months. It's absolute ruination to their beastly old house. We'll put our chimneys on the very edge, not 300 yards off. And our smoke will be drifting right over them. Won't have this confounded, stuck-up woman here much longer. And then we can really go ahead and take our proper place. So long as she's here, we shall never do that. We've only got to drive on now as fast as we can. I see. You know, if you go on like this, I shall begin to think that... Charlie! There. You want a good rest, that's all. You haven't started your dinner yet, have you? You go down and I'll go to bed quite soon. Don't stop loving me, Charlie. Stop? Not much. Seeing you yesterday at the auction did seem rotten. We didn't begin it. No, but you don't understand. If you've made yoursel f as father has... I hope I should be sorry. Now, that's not like you. He can't help thinking he's a public benefactor. And we can't help thinking he's a pig. Oh, sorry. If the survival of the fittest is right... he may be the fitter, but he isn't going to survive. It looks like it though. Is that all you came to say? No. Couldn't... couldn't we join together? Couldn't we stop it? I don't feel like joining. Well, we did shake hands. You can't fight and not grow bitter. I don't feel bitter. Oh, wait. You will soon enough. Why? Oh, Chloe. I do think your mother' s manner to her is... well? Well, snobbish. She may not be in your class, but that's just why it's snobbish. I think you better shut up. What my father said was true. Your mother's rudeness to her yesterday has made both he and Charlie ever so much bitter. Is this a whistling matter? No. I suppose you want me to go. Yes. All right. Aren't we ever going to be friends again? I don't expect so. That's very horrible. Lots of horrible things in this world. It's up to us to make them pure, Jill. And be immoral? That's the last thing I want to be. I only want to be friendly. That would be a real first. Yes, but... but from the big point of view... there isn't any. We're all out for our own. And why not? By jove, you have got... cynical? Each man for himself. That's the winner, hands down. Good-bye. Jill. Jill. ? Should old acquaintance be forgot for the...? Oh. All right, I'll go and tell her. Excuse me, madam. Mr. Dawker's here... now, this may come into court, you know, so if there's a weak point in any way, better administer it at once. You are absolutely sure of the girl? There's no question of it. Here's a cutting of the actual case. Hmm. Come this way. Morning, ma'am. I brought my friend's partner with me. Is mr. Hornblower coming? At 11:00. But only after I had sent up a second note to him. Squire's not in? L... I haven't told him. Well, I think our friends might wait in there, then we can use them when we want to. Will you make yourselves comfortable? I've had this drawn and engrossed. Pretty smart work. It conveys that centry added long meadow to the squire for 4,500. Now, mum, if Hornblower puts his hand to that, he'll have been done in the eye and 6,000 out of pocket. You will have a very nasty neighbor there. But we shall still have the power to disclose that secret at any time? Yeah, but things may happen you can't bring home to him. You can't trust a man like that. He isn't likely to forgive me, I know. But if he signs, we couldn't honor that. No, no, ma'am. You couldn't. I'm sure I don't want to do that girl a hurt. I only mention it because of course, you can't guarantee that it won't get out. Not absolutely, I suppose. That's his car. It always seems to make more noise than any other. But you leave him to us what you want. And uh, I wouldn't mention this. The centry's no mortal good to him if he can't put up works. I reckon he'll be glad to save what he can. Mr. Hornblower to see you, madam, by appointment, he says. I've come to ask you point blank what you mean by writing me these letters. I will discuss it in the presence of nobody, if you please. Mr. Dawker knows just as much as I do, and more. Does he? Very well. Your second note says that my daughter-in-law has lied to me. Well, I've brought her. , and what you've got to say if it's not just a trick to see me again, you will say to her face. Mr. Hornblower, you'd better decide that after hearing what it is. We shall be quite ready to repeat it in her presence, but... we want to do as little harm as possible... oh. You do, do you? Well, what lies have you been hearing, eh? Or what have you made up? You and mr. Dawker. I suppose you know there's such a thing as the law of libel and slander. I'm not the man to stoop at that. Are you familiar with the law of divorce, mr. Hornblower? No, I'm not. Well, in that case... no misconduct is required. I suppose you've heard that cases are arranged. I know it's all very shocking. What about it? Some cases are arranged, mr. Hornblower. The man who is to be divorced often visits an hotel with a strange woman. I'm extremely sorry to have to say that your daughter-in-law, before her marriage, was in the habit of being employed as such a woman. It's all proved up to the hilt. I don't believe a word of it. You're lying to save your skins! How dare you tell me such monstrosities! Dawker, I'll have you in a criminal court! Oh, rats. You saw the gentleman that was with me yesterday? Well, he's employed her. A put up job, sir! A conspiracy! Go and fetch your daughter-in-law. It's a foul shame. A lying slander. And so it's easily disproved. Go and fetch her. I will. Now, then, let's have this impudent story torn to rags. What story? You, my dear. When a woman who... oh, it's too shocking. I don't know how to tell you. Go on. When a woman that went with men to get them their divorce. Who says that? That lady here. And her bull terrier there. That's a charitabl e thing to say, isn't it? Is it true? No! Here, I'll have you both on your knees to her. How do you do, mrs. Vane? I don't know you. You've got a bad memory, ma'am. You knew me well enough yesterday. A day's not a long time, nor 3 years. Who are you? I don't know you, I say. Let me refresh your memory, ma'am just on 3 years ago, "october 3, fee and expenses mrs. Vane with mr. C. "Hotel buli 20. October 10, ditto. 20." If you like to have a look at the book, sir, you'll see the entries are quite genuine. No. It's lies, a lot of lies. Come, ma'am. We wish you no harm. Take me away. I won't be treated like this. Lies! Were you ever called vane? No, never! There. Don't tell Charlie father. I'm all at sea here. Go out and wait for me in the car. What do you want for this... secret? Nothing. Indeed? Wonderful the trouble you've tak en for nothing. If you harm us, we shall harm you... any use whatever of the centry. For which you made me pay 9,500. We'll buy it from you. What price? The centry at the price miss Mullins was willing to take it first. Longmeadow at the price you gave up. $4,500 in all. A fine price! And me 6,000 out of pocket. No, no, I'll keep it. And hold it over you. You daren't tell the secret so long as I've got it. Well, then, you go your own way, and we'll go ours. There's no witness to this conversation. By heaven! You're a clever woman. Will you swear by almighty god that you and your family and that agent of yours won't breathe a word of this shocking thing to a mortal soul? Yes... if you sell. Where's Dawker? Dawker. Mr. Dawker! I suppose you've got your iniquity ready. It's mighty near conspiracy, miss. Have you got a testament? My word will be enough... you will pardon me. I can't make it solemn enough for you. Very well. I'll get the bible. It's a short conveyanc e of the centry and Longmeadow. Site sale by miss Mullins, the first. John Hillcrist, the second. And whereas you agreed for the sale to John Hillcrist the said property for the sum of 4,500, in consideration of said sum... ahem... you hereby acknowledge that you do convey all that and et cetera, et cetera. Sign here. Eyewitness. To that oath, mr. Hornblower, we shall add the words, "so long as the Hornblower family do us no harm." Take it in your hands, both of you. Together. Swear. Swear by almighty god... I swear by almighty god... never to breathe a word of what I know... concerning... Chloe Hornblower... concerning Chloe Hornblower... to any living soul. To any living soul. So long as the Hornblower family do us no harm. Oh, dada, she looked like a lost soul. What has she done? She committed her real crime when she married young Hornblower without telling him she came out of a certain world to do it. Oh. Is it very awful in that world, dada? I don't know, Jill some can stand it, I suppose. Some can't. One thing I'm... I don't know which sort she is. One thing I'm sure of, she's awfully fond of Charlie. D. That's bad. That's very ba and she's frightened horribly. I think she's desperate. Oh, dada. I'm not enjoying her much tonight. I never could hate properly. It's a confounded nuisance. Mother's fearfully bucked, and Dawker's simply oozing triumph. I don't trust him, dodo. He's too... not puglistic, but the other one with a "pug". Pugnacious. Hmm, he is, rather. I'm sure he wouldn't care a tuppence if Chloe committed suicide. Nonsense, nonsense. I wonder if mother would. What's that? I thought I heard... is there anyone out there? Oh! Oh, come in. It's only us. Good evening. Won't you sit down? Yes, do sit down. You're all shaky. Is there anything I can do? I couldn't bear it. He's coming to ask you. Who? My husband. I've got to be quick. He keeps on asking. He knows there's something. Make your mind easy. We shan't tell him oh, that's not enough. Can't you tell him something to put him back to thinking it's all right? I've done him such a wrong I didn't realize it till after. I thought meeting him was such a wonderful piece of good luck After all I'd been through I'm not such a bad lot. Not really. You see, my father went bankrupt, and I was in a shop till... oh, I never gave a man away or did anything I was ashamed of, at least, I mean... I had to make my living in all sorts of ways. And then I met Charlie. He thought I was respectable, and that was such a relief, you can't think. So I let him... well, after I married him, you see, I fell in love. Oh, if I had of before, perhaps I wouldn't have dared. Only I don't know. You don't know, do you? When there's a straw going, you catch it. Yes, of course you do. I've been on hot brick s all these months, ever since the row started and Dawker began to spy on me. I knew it was in the wind. What gets in the wind never gets out. Never. Just blows and then blows home. Well, I paid for being a fool. It isn't fun, that sor t of life, I can tell you. Oh, I'm not ashamed and repentant and all that. If it wasn't for him. I'm afraid he'll never forgive me. It's such a disgrace for him. Being fond of him I feel it worse than anything I ever felt before, and that's saying a good bit. Tears. Look here, dada. He simply mustn't find out. Oh, that's it! But he's bound to go on, because he knows there's something. A man isn't going to be satisfied when there's something he suspects about his wife. Charlie wouldn't never. He's clever, and he's jealous, and he's coming here. Couldn't we say something to put him clean off the scent? Anything in reason. Oh, you will. You see, I don't know what I'll do. I've got soft being looked after. He does love me. And if he throws me off, I shall go under, that's all. Have you any suggestion? The only thing is to tell him something positive, something he'll believe that's not too bad. Like my having been a lady clerk for those people who came here this morning and having been dismissed on suspicion of taking money. I'll get him to believe that that wasn't true. Yes, and it isn't. Oh, that's splendid! You would put just conviction into it. Don't you think so, dada? It's all unspeakably sad. Deceptions horribly against the grain... when I deceived him, I would deceive god himself, I was so miserable! You've never been brought down in the mud. You don't know what I've been through yes, yes, I daresay I should have done the same. I should be the last to judge. There, there, cheer up. There's somebody at the door! I must go. Oh, I forgot. It's locked. Charles Hornblower. Is my wife here? No, sir. Has she been here? This morning, I believe. Jill? Yes, she came this morning. I know that. Now, I mean. Now? Tell me what was said this morning. I wasn't here this morning. Don't try and put me off. I know too much. Shall I go, dad? No, I will. Won't you sit down? No. Well, it appears that my agent, mr. Dawker... that my agent happens to know the firm who in the old days employed your wife. I should greatly prefer not to say anymore, especially as we don't believe the stories. No, we don't. What else? Charlie, if I were you, I should refuse to listen to anything against my wife. Go on, I tell you. If you insist. Well, they say there was some question of the accounts, that your wife left under a cloud. T. So I told you we don't believe I liars! What did you say? We are, you know, dada. What did you tell me that for? When I've just had the truth out of that little rat? My wife has been here. I know she put you up to it, liar that she is. For years, nothing but lies. She hasn't the pluck to come and tell me. I've finished with her. I wouldn't own a child by a woman like that. For god's sake, ma n, think what you're saying. She's in great distress. And what about me? She loves you, you know. Fine love. That scoundrel Dawker told me... told me that... it's horrible. I'm terribly sorry that our quarrel should have brought this about. Yes, you smashed my life. Would you have wished to remain on in ignorance? Oh, I don't know, but you did it. You shouldn't have attacked us. What did we do to you compared with this? All you could. What can we do to help you? Tell me where my wife is. Then she was here. Dada, I'm awfully afraid oughtn't we to look for her? I saw her there listening. One never knows what may happen. You go to the gravel pit, Jill, and I'll go to the pond. No, we'll go together. Oh, fellowes, I want somebody to go down for mr. Dawker. Mr. Dawker's here, madam, waiting to see you. Well, ask him to come in, and fellowes, you can tell the Jackmans that they can go back to that cottage. Very good, madam. What's all this about Charles Hornblower? He came to me, and I told him I knew nothing. He wouldn't take it and went for me, said he knew everything. Then he started to threaten me, and I lost my temper, and I told him. That's very seriou s, Dawker... after our promise. My husband is most upset. It isn't my fault, ma'am. He shouldn't have threatened me and goaded me on like that. Besides, it's got out as a scandal, common talk in the village. Oh, not the facts, of course, but quite enough to cook their goose here. They'll have to go. Better have done with anyway than have enemies at your door. Well, perhaps. Take charge of this, Dawker. These people are desperate, and I'm not sure of my husband when his feelings are aroused. You better wait. He better not give me any of his sauce. I've had enough. Give me that deed. You got it out of me by false pretenses and treachery. You swore that nothing should be heard of this. Why, me own servants know. That's nothing to do with us. Your son wrenched the knowledge from mr. Dawker by abuse and tricks, that's all. You better behave yourself, or I shall ask that you be shown out. Give me that deed... you little ruffian, I see it in your pocket. Rolf! All of you, stop! No! Bring her in! Get the brandy, quick! No! Stand back, young woman. I want no help from any of you. Rolf, help Charlie. Take her to the car. Hillcrist... you've got me beaten. And disgraced hereabouts. You've ruined my son's married life, and you've killed... my grandchild. I'm not staying in this cursed spot, but if ever I can do you or yours a hurt I will. Hornblower, in the presence of what may be death, with all my heart I'm sorry. You... hypocrite! Jackmans, madam. Who? What's this? We're so glad we can go along back, sir. Ma'am... we wanted to thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you kindly. Good night, sir. Good night, ma'am. Good night, sir. I'd forgotten their existence. What is it that gets loose when you start a fight and makes you what you think you're not? Begin as you may, it ends in this skin game. Skin game. When we began this fight, we had clean hands. Are they clean now? What's gentility worth if it can't stand fire?
