Harrison Ford, eh? Behind me is Eva Peron's palace, where she held her famous speech. There. - Oh yes. Hey Rose, when we were here... this statue was already here and I was mad about your father. I really wanted a child and this statue made me so emotional. I thought: I hope I'll soon have a little baby like that and that was you. What's your most beautiful memory? Of us together there? I sure know that. I think it was in the fountain. A huge fountain... in a red dress. Weren't you? I don't have a single red dress. Maybe it was someone else? - Let's stop filming now, Sarah? Take the bag, Sarah. - Yes. Okay. Well, Rose. We're here. It's exactly the same, isn't it? Isn't that amazing? Well done, Rose. Mind the step. Goodness... It's... - It hasn't changed. It's incredible. Tiny kitchen. Bathroom. Yes, we remember this well. Oh yes... Come on. What's this? - I'm going to... carry on filming for Rose. A tiny hallway as you can see. I think the stuffed beaver at the end is really funny. It was here then. We always ate here, three times a day. Basically all the time. There was always a boat. I hope it's still here. It's a shop that sails by and then... - Sorry, Sarah... I really can't cope. What? Sorry. We both think the same, don't we? I just arrived here and... Are we going to pretend there's no problem? We just keep chattering the whole time? We made our dear little Rose here. Remember? No, it's weird. I don't remember. - No? That's a pity. Sarah. Come here, come. Sarah! What do you want?! - To talk. Why are we here? We might as well have stayed at home if we don't talk, eh? Okay, fine. Then we'll talk. You start. You start. Do you still love me? Thanks. Delicious. Hello, darling... I just wanted to say that I think you're really brave. Really. You were quite right. And I'm terribly sorry. And I... I promise to do my very best. What are you doing? - Cooking. Since when do you cook? Well, I felt like it. Shall I help? That's fine. Wine? Yes, please. What shall I do? You do the vegetables. - Fine. Vegetables. They're over there. It's up to you. May I take the lead? You have to take the lead. If you do, I'll follow. You do have to follow. Okay. So your follow? Okay. If you take the lead. Ready. Yes, there we go. Don't stop... It's good. Sarah, don't stop. Let yourself go. I don't think you want to. What? - You don't want me. You want... Darling, what's this? - You only want... You only want... - What's this? Hey! Sarah... Only what? What's this all about? Get lost. Tell me, dammit. What's this all about? Spit it all out. What's up? What?! Are you disappointed in me? Is that it? You thought I was a successful writer but I'm a loser? Don't be hypocritical! - What? Tell me. You want us to be honest. To let it all hang out. Well tell me! Darling, I'm trying to be honest but I don't understand. Sorry. That you... That you've been fucking some Ellen for a year! Jesus Christ. I'm not stupid! You've known for a year? Yes, or is it longer? Why didn't you say anything? Why didn't you ask me anything? - What was I supposed to say? How do I know? Maybe why I was with another woman? Why are you with another woman? Because I miss you. Because I really miss you. You were so fucking warm. You understand that? Tell me. Who is this Ellen? If you don't say anything, this is pointless. It's pointless anyway. Isn't it? All week you won't talk, you won't laugh, you won't fuck. You fuck someone else. You don't need me. Don't need you? Listen to yourself. As if it was a fucking obligation! Maybe it is an obligation for you? Why else would you keep quiet for a year? It's so easy. - You can get down to work. Earning money, compliments from the boss. That's easy!! - Easy? I'm a frigid career bitch, so that you can fuck some other woman?! Yes Indeed, I do love my work. Some people do love their work. But I also fuck. But not with you. Get lost. I don't believe a word. So who is he? - What do you care? You have Ellen, don't you? Who is he? Who is he?! David. No, don't walk away. Since when? - Do you care? You are a real bitch. - Yes, I'm a bitch. Well, Rose. The bus to the airport didn't turn up. So I think we'd better take a taxi. Sarah, stop filming now. What do we say to Rose when we get home? That we're splitting up? Is that what you want? What do you want? I... We should get out of here. What now? Wait. We'll take that bus. I'll flag him down. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Okay. Okay. Together okay? This is bizarre, isn't it? You don't want the cops after you here. That's obvious. Dammit. Look! Fuck, man. What do we do now? We going home. As fast as we can. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Shit, shit! Listen, Sarah. will say nothing, okay? Just sit down. We have nothing to hide. Sit down, Sarah! We have to run, Johan. Run! They to see your passport, Sarah. Run! Run! Johan, this way. It's a dead-end. Come on. Here, Sarah. Fuck! Johan, here! Come on, come on. We have to go to the police. - Sarah, that was the police! We have to get to the airport. Out of here. This isn't our business. Let's just go home. - They have our passport, tickets. Sarah. - Shit! Johan, come on! Inside. Come on! Inside there. Come on, Johan. Come on. What? Wait, wait. We don't have a choice. Come on. Let me look. We have to go to hospital. - No, the airport. To hospital, you're bleeding. - No, the airport. We need a hospital. - There's no point. Really. Don't be stubborn. - They'll keep us there! Shut up. that man has to call an ambulance right now. The airport. We have to get out! Sarah! I'll call an ambulance. - Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Shit. Fuck. Sarah? Sarah, come on! This way. Sarah! Johan! Hi darling Rose. Well... here we are... at the spot where it all started. Last time we were here... when Dad and I were so in love. I can't imagine any other man I would prefer to Dad. I... All I want is for things to work out again. I know I lost myself in my work in recent years and... that's also because... I know... it's really stupid, I know. But if I take a day off, then... In a way I feel shut out. You two... I've been with you so little... And I... My head is so full... of work, that I sometimes find it very difficult to switch it off. I know it's all my fault. I know. And I'm really, really sorry. I'm really, really sorry. Sarah! Sarah, are you okay?! Are you okay? - Yes. Put your foot down! Go on, drive. Faster! Jesus! Sarah, what a smash. Does it hurt? It's okay. Fine. - You're sure. Drive! Faster, faster. Oh, fuck. Keep it up, okay? Where are we going? To the hospital. Okay, to the hospital. Fuck. Come on. Sit down. Your mother is right. I don't dare commit myself. I always leave it... Sometimes I want to say sorry, but then I don't... It's so stupid to want to be right all the time. While, I'm not rights at all. And your mother... she's really fantastic... The most beautiful woman in the world. The first time I saw her... ...your mother was dancing. I don't know. She looked at me and I thought: 'Fuck, what is this?' I was devastated. I felt like a little boy who couldn't say a word. I could only think: 'Oh, I want that woman. I want that woman.' And then... Weird. Where did it all go? Did it disappear? It's gone? It's weird that it's gone. Everything we had has gone. Difficult. Complicated. Fighting all the time. I don't want that. I don't want to fight. I just want... I want us to enjoy each other. I only want to be with her. I don't know. I think it's my fault. I'm such a fucking coward. That's what it is. Are you okay? Yes. It's been stitched and I've had some painkillers... I don't feel bad. - Bastard! I thought you were dying. - I thought so too. Show-off. I have a nose for drama. I don't know what he wants, but gracias seor. Can you manage? - Yes, it's okay. We're going home. We going to see Rose. They have everything. They have our tickets, passports, phones. We have nothing. We'll call the embassy, whatever. I don't care. We have to leave. Can you walk? I limp a little, but... Okay... walk. Okay, here we go. Come on. Let's go, Sarah. Police. Sarah, calm down. Sarah, don't. Let go of him. Let go. Don't respond. Let go of him... - I want to go home. Home. Let go. Let go. Okay. Darling! We'll die here. We'll just die here. Quiet. Quiet. It'll be all right. Really. We'll come out of this. Okay. Really. I promise. Sarah, we'll do this together. Darling, listen. Listen to me. I'll never leave you alone again. Okay? We'll get through this. I have no idea how, but we'll soon be on-board the plane home to see Rose. Yes. Where did you get that. You took it out? Don't let them get the card. We know nothing about it. We didn't see anything. Sarah, don't. Don't and. Say nothing. Shut up. Say nothing, Sarah. Let go. Let go. Okay. Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. Don't, Sarah. It's okay, darling. Don't say anything. Keep your mouth shut. We'll get out of this. You have to keep quiet. Look at me. Look at me. It's okay, Sarah. It's me. Sarah, please. Please Sarah. listen to me. You have to help. Sarah, we have to get out. Come on. Sarah, It's okay. It's me. Come on. Sarah, listen. We have to get out quick. I'll get the passport and tickets and then we'll leave. We'll go to Rose. Put this shirt on. Put it on, please. Quickly. I'll be back in a minute. Stay there. Fuck. Passports. I can do it. Sarah? Sarah! Come on. - You left me alone. What? I'm here, darling. - Bastard. I didn't lose you. I'm here. We have two go to Rose. Quick... Who is Ellen. What? - Who is Ellen? Darling. Do you love her? She's no one. Believe me. No one. It's not important. Let's go. Rose is waiting for us. Please, Sarah! Come with me. Dammit! Sarah, just listen to me. Sarah, listen. The airport is close by. We have to go. But you have to help. Sarah. Sarah, listen. Okay, Sarah Listen. I'll call Rose. You can tell her we're on our way. Okay? That we are coming. Hello. - Hi, dear. This is Dad. Why are you calling? It's the middle of the night. Dad? There's no problem, darling. It's okay. Mum and I are on our way home. Okay? Dad? You sound strange. What's up? Where is Mum? Mum is here. She's here beside me... It'll be all right, okay? - Okay. Listen, Rose. You must do something for me. It's important. Talk to Mum for a moment. Just talk to her. It doesn't matter what about. Just calmly. Don't ask questions. It's Rose. It's Rose. Mum, are you there? Mum, I... We had a school party yesterday. Grandma gave me money for new clothes. I went shopping with Anouk. I brought bright red skinny jeans. Mum? I... - What, darling? You don't have to stay together. Maybe it was a stupid idea, but... No, it was a really good idea. It was? - Yes. Listen, darling. Listen. We're going to the airport. We'll be home in a few hours. By, darling. I love you. - I love you both too. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you. I have a nose for drama. Time we'll go to the nearest Dutch beach. Sarah, let's take that car. Sarah, get in. Come on! Okay Sarah, will make it easily. Okay. Passports? - I have them. Ready? - Yes. Let's check the gate. Come on. Ten more minutes. Fuck. Come on. Gate 54... Sarah. Look at me. There's no problem. Come on. It'll be okay. Sarah. Come back. Johan! Sarah, give me the camera. That card. The bastard won't get away with it. The bus to the airport didn't turn up. So I think we'd better take a taxi. What do we say to Rose when we get home? That we're splitting up? Is that what you want? What do you want? We can go home. What do we say to Rose?
