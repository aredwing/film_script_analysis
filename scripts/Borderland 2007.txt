Except for the mouth. Looks like blood. Let's have it checked out. Find something that connects him with the Vasquez cartel. Good. Ulises! Ulises! I think I found something else. And it looks human! Now can we please get the fuck out of here? Polical Come out now! Looks like they moved out in a hurry. Son of a bitch must have known we were coming. They came out of nowhere, Ulises. Your jails can't hold us. And your bullets can't hurt us. We just want to talk to Santillan. You're too late. He turned into a bird... and flew away. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Ulises. Ulises... Help me. Cowardly sons of bitches. So what do we do with these? Take them up to the farm. Papa wants a cop's eyes for his Nganga. Finish him. Me? Prove yourself, Luis. Prove yourself. Or should I tell Papa you didn't have the balls? Please... Leave him alone... Leave him alone. Leave him alone, you son of a bitch! Leave him alone! Open your eyes. - No! - Open your eyes. No, you sick bastard! Papa wants you to watch... and tell your cop buddies... who did this. Noooo! Poor people are poor because they're lazy. You know what? Fuck the poor. Fuck 'em, all right? What, it's my problem that somebody can't compete in the open market? We're supposed to help the disadvantaged. Boo-fuckin'- hoo. My old man, he was a mechanic, okay? A grease monkey his whole life. Now, in two days, I'm off to the Wharton School. Two years, I got my MBA, and the world is my oyster. You're an inspiration to us all. Can we go now? Some primo sticky for my beautiful lefty friend. Hey, why don't you, uh, stick around? You coming? Bye, Henry. We gotta bail this fuckin' summer camp. Did you find Ed? No. But I did watch some guy nail Courtney Anderson. Oh, yeah? That's practically a rite of passage. Yeah, well, I haven't. Right. That's 'cause your head's been filled with all that wack fire and brimstone shit. It's not wack, Henry. Yo, where the fuck is Eddie? I wanna get to the border by noon. Hey! Ed! Eddie! Dude, where ya been? We've been looking for you all night. Hey, stop worrying. You're doing the right thing. Shit! No way! - You fucking maniac! - Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay! - What the fuck's wrong with you? - Whoo! Fuck! Lmagine a land, if you will, where a man can be a man. A land where he can indulge in all those animal urges, far from the petty judgments of parents and teachers and less-enlightened peers. A land where he can ride the demon! - Yeah! - Behave bad! - Bad! - Whatever he goddamn well pleases, and no one gives a shit, including the cops. Tell it, Brother Henry! - I'm talking real freedom, my friend! - Real freedom! Not this overregulated bullshit that passes for liberty in our country. Hell, no! Let's go to the border! Mexico. We leave right now, we hit Manzanita right about the time the strip joints open. - I'm gonna get laid. - You're kidding. I finally convinced our upstanding minister's son - to get his cherry popped. - Pop! A truly blessed event. Let's pray he doesn't contract an STD. Worrywart. Fellas, say hello to the senoritas for me. Come on, man. You're not gonna hang around here. All right? All the poonsies are hooked up or singing "Kumbaya" with the art fags. Any other time, I'm there, all right? I just have a lot on my mind. You want a Zoloft, man? I think I got one. - I just wanna chill. - Chill when you're dead, man. Come on. You're going off to Stanford. I'm off to Penn. Phil's off to wherever the fuck he's going, right? As your personal physician, I insist you put that big brain of yours to rest and go a little nuts, okay, for once. Rise and shine, faggot. Wharton, motherfucker! Wharton! Whoop-whoop, Wharton! You're gonna be the first dealer on your block with an MBA. Yeah, fuck all that, man. I'm getting out of pharmaceuticals. Human cloning is about to explode, dude. Keep everything offshore, do your marketing on the Internet. Promise me you won't clone yourself. You know, when you get out of Stanford, man, I could use you on my team. What do you say? Feel like being a rich son of a bitch? Is that really the best we can do? What? Get rich? Yeah. We could do worse. For example. What's going on? Well, your mother and I were just discussing how disappointed we were you couldn't get into a decent law school. What's wrong with Austin? It's in the top 100. One hundred what? Oh! Hey! Hot car! Welcome to the happiest place on Earth. Hey, chickie! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, gringo, hello! Welcome to Mexico. I have a surprise for you, you know? Three beers for a buck. Hey, I have three VIP passes for you. - Come on, eh? - All right. What's up? Beautiful broads. Let's go, my friend! Welcome to Mexico. Hey! Juan, I got three. Can you believe this? That chick back there just asked me to go back to her place and grind. Why didn't I come down here years ago? Are you sure this is what you want? What, you mean, uh, sex? Yeah. But it's your first time. Don't you want it to mean something? It does mean something. I mean, you guys are here, right? What a Hallmark moment. I'll be right back. Hold on one minute. Hola. Una ms cerveza, por favor. "Fabor. " Pardon? "Fabor. " The V is pronounced like a B. "Fabor. Cerbeza. " Sorry. My Spanish sucks. At least you can order a beer at a strip club. What else do you need to know? She wants 80 for an hour, and she'll do anal. Anal? Who said I want anal? Well, you got a problem with anal? No, I... You asked her that? She's a professional, okay? If I'm paying for her services, I think I have a right to know what they include. She's barely 17, okay? She's practically a virgin herself. Do not pass this up, okay? I want you to have a good time. I want you to grow up. I want you to be a man. Hey, wait a minute. This is for you. But you already know that. - I'm talking to you! - Let me go! - Now, asshole. - Fucking bitch! Why don't you chill, man? She's no pro. It's okay. I can handle it. It's okay. This dickless faggot more your type, Valeria? Fuck off, Gilberto. You think you have the balls for this girl? I ask you something. You deaf? What the fuck's your problem, man? Ow! Shit! That was pretty stupid. At least now you have a great story to tell your friends. What? That I got my ass kicked? No. How you came to the aid of a poor and defenseless woman. Yeah, right. If it ever gets boring around here, you could bat cleanup for the Astros. You know, my ex-husband, he hated the fact that I could handle myself. Let me guess. That's why he's your ex. I left him, and I moved here to Manzanita. Can I buy you a drink later? So you're not afraid of strong woman? Only if she's not swinging a bat at me. It's okay, don't be afraid. I'm not. I mean... Does that have to be there? You don't like it? I do. It's just... I feel like I'm being watched. You have a kid? Oh, I'm so going to hell. What's her name? Mati. Don't cry. She's beautiful, Amelia. She likes you. I'm working with amateurs, I swear to God. You almost get yourself cold over some bangette. - And you! - What? Falling for a hooker? Come on. Come on, Phil. You're killing me. I like her. She's sweet. So what? I thought you wanted to get laid. - Her kid was right there. - So? I paid 80 bucks so he could change diapers. You want your money back? Here. Just fucking take it. I'm going to the bathroom. Yeah, you do that, putz. You try to raise them right. Hey, isn't that your hot tamale? That's Valeria. Try to act halfway civilized for once. Hola. Hola. Um, this is my cousin, Lupe. Lupe, this is Eduardo. Hola. Hola. What is up with your cousin? She's just, uh, traditional. Tell her that 'shrooms are nature's way of saying hi. What? Not for you? I'm really not big on hallucinogens. He's afraid he'll jump off a building or go Leatherface on somebody. - Oh, there you are. - Come on. - Come on, Ed. - All right. - Yeah, Ed! - All right. I like her. All right. - These are fuckin' nasty. - Don't throw up, okay? You guys wanna get stoned? Fuck, yeah! Hey, dude! You almost done in there? They're gonna start charging you rent! Not a moment too soon. You scored, amigo. You know what you should do? Invite her up to Palo Alto. I'm not going to Palo Alto. What do you mean? I'm bailing on Stanford. I never sent my letter back. Hey, dudes, I'm, uh... I'm getting out of here. I wanna give this to Mati. Dude, you're tripping. No, no, no. I'm fine, really. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. You're not leaving. No, I'm a fifth wheel. I'll just catch a cab and, you know, catch up with you guys later. Gonna beat me. - That's my grandfather. - Oh, sorry, senor. This is amazing. All these flowers. It's not depressing at all. - It should be, but... - Do you think death's sad? Don't you? I think that life, when it's not fully lived... is... much sadder. - Come on. - You're going down. There is no God. Most people are terrified by that thought. I find it very comforting. There is no one God. There are many. I'm sorry. What? I said there is no one god. There are many, and they live among us. It's weird, but ever since we crossed the border, I don't feel like me anymore. Who do you feel like? Myself. I think... you're high. - Really. - Really? Yeah. Hey! Got a light? Fuck! Oh, you scared the shit out of me. Oh, sorry. Thanks. Oh, man, you don't look so good. I'm peaking. What? Look, my friends and I can give you a ride. Yeah? What's your name, anyway? - Phillip. - ndale. Hey. Come in. Hey, come in. Come in. Come in. This is my friend, Phillip. He's an American. You know what? I'm gonna walk anyway. Get up, you shit ball. What time is it? I don't know. Phil didn't make it back last night. Yeah? I thought you wanted to get an early start. Ten more minutes. You rode her bareback? Dude, I cannot believe it. You of all people. That's why I don't 'shroom. So? You nailed her the way that nature intended it. You tapped into the beast. Dude, I'm proud of you. Suppose she gets pregnant or I get AIDS? Would that make you proud? How do you get through life, huh? By using my head. Oh, yeah? Then tell me how the fuck blowing off Stanford is using your head. You wouldn't understand. Try me. Look, he knows we wanted to leave early. What the fuck is wrong with him? Did you try his cell? There's no service. So what are you gonna do? I got a few ideas. Like? Working for this volunteer group. The International Relief Corps. They're building these irrigation canals down in Malawi, and they need some help organizing. You fucking with me? No. That's... That's beautiful, man! What are you gonna do next? Buy a Volvo and join the fucking Democratic party? Jesus, Eddie. I thought I knew you. You turned into a fucking softball. You awake in there? Hey! Phillip, right? I looked at your passport. I'm Randall. It's nice to meet you. You thirsty? Where the fuck am I? The other side of the rainbow. It's a little melted, but chocolate's good for you. Here. Sorry about the smell. You get used to it. Hey! Get out of here! Little shits. Hey... What do you want with me? You're the man of the hour, amigo. You're gonna get to meet Papa real soon. He's an amazing man. Yeah. You just sit tight, relax. You need anything, you just ask me, all right? Food, water, whatever you want. You'll be good. You like to watch television? I think I got an extra television laying around here somewhere. Reception sucks, but it beats thinking about shit. Dude, wait. Hey, hey! Hey, who are you guys? Hey! Who are you guys? What am I doing here? Our amigo is missing. Do you understand? Missing. So what's the problem? Excuse me. Does anybody here speak English? Ingls? - S. - S. Ingls. - You speak a little Ingls? - No. Un momento. Get out of here! Not until I talk to Ramirez. Get the hell out of here! - I'm not leaving until Ramirez leaves. - Rodriguez! - Rodriguez. - Yes, Commander. - Let him pass. - Yes, sir. Get your animals out of here. Just look at the evidence, that's all I'm asking. Look! Welcome to the turd world. S? Uh, yes? - You speak English? - Yes, a little. Oh, man, I'm glad to see you. They robbed a grave last night. They stole a child's body. It's for Santillan's Nganga! They're preparing it for his arrival. You asked me to listen to your story, and I have. Forget about your partner. This isn't Mexico City; this isn't even Mexico. This is the border. The border has no memory. Remembering here... gets you killed. Look, something happened to him, and he's not banging some girl. So what are you gonna do about it? I'm sorry. Until your friend is missing for at least 72 hours, there is nothing we can do. Don't worry. He'll turn up. Fuck! I never should've let him go. We're... We're gonna have to call his parents. What, and tell them we let him wander off high on 'shrooms to find a hooker? Just give it another couple hours, okay? Do I have any messages? Henry's staking out the hotel in case he shows. Other than that, there's not much we can do. I'm fucked, and it's all my fault. Maybe someone in this girl Amelia's neighborhood saw something. You could ask around. With my Spanish? No. With mine. Come on. Lupe. Do you know what this is for? It's for the Disappeared. What did she say? I'm not sure in English. It's, like, those who have vanished. Where are you from? A little shit hole called San Anton. Oh, yeah? Hey, do you know Vinnie's Pizza? On Alvarez? The best pies in Texas. Yeah. It's the one thing I miss being over here. One thing I don't miss: American women. The most stuck-up bitches on Earth. Couldn't get play there to save my life. That's hard to believe. You messing with me? No. There's three bitches in Los Angeles and two in Phoenix that messed with me. They're still looking for the bodies. Know what I mean, jelly bean? Listen, my parents have a little money. If I can just make a phone call. It's not about that, home-style. What is it about? The spirits. Spirits? The whole world is alive with spirits. Before I knew about this place, right? If I fucked somebody up... you know, I killed them or whatever, 'cause they pissed me off, or I just felt the urge that day, you know? Then Papa, he showed me another way. He taught me how to use that urge. You know? How to channel it. Connect with the spirits. I'm talking about Palo. Palo-Mayombe. It's supposed to be some shit from Africa. Yeah, but what does that have to do with me? Papa's gonna use you to talk to him. He needs you. This is big, home-style. Don't you get it? Your life's gonna change. It's gonna mean something. I can feel it. There's something in the air. Something poisonous. I've only been here two months, but this is different. You know, you live in a really screwed-up country. No offense. I guess nobody ever gets kidnapped in the U.S. Hey, we don't know if he's been kidnapped. What, then? What's wrong? Car's just sitting there. Driver's been staring at us. Green piece of shit's been hanging out since I got here. Look, don't get paranoid. Maybe he's waiting for his girlfriend. You got an issue, asshole? - Go home, whitey. - That's Phil's. Hey. Hey! Son of a bitch! Oh, my God! Hey! Is anybody out there? Randall? Hello! What's your problem? I gotta piss. You just went. I mean, I gotta shit. You want me to shit my pants? Got some pretty brave friends. You know that? What do you mean? Poking their nose where they shouldn't be poking it. That's a good way to lose your nose... and plenty more. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You gotta undo my pants, too. Do I look like some kind of homo? Fucking beaners. Always give me the shit jobs just because I'm illegal. It's discrimination. Fuck. Come here, you son of a bitch! Come here! Hey! Hey! Please! Wait! No! Come here! You try that again, I will blow your ass away! Understand? Yes. Yes. You just lost your TV privileges, bitch. Chain him up. The drug runners on the farm, they are followers of Palo-Mayombe. And their priest is a man called Santillan. A week ago, two of his people were in the store. I overheard them talking. They were looking for a gringo. - Yes, ma'am? - Are you open? Yes. I want to buy something. Come in. I'll take care later. If Santillan took your friend, there is nothing you can do. So what are you saying? We should bail on a fellow marine because of some lame-ass Mexican voodoo cult? They tell people that their souls are dead, like they're proud. People like that, they are capable of anything. Stay away from these boys, Valeria. It is dangerous. Excuse me, but don't youhave incense? S, senora. I'll get it. Henry, hold on. Don't fuck with these guys. - I'm tired of being jerked around. - We should go to the police. Fuck the police! They're fucking useless! Would you chill the fuck out? This is not the way to handle it. Maybe we should consult with our allies, and the U.N. You're only gonna make it worse. Worse than it already is? You know what you are, Eddie? Bottom line, you're a chickenshit. That's why you're running off to Africa. You wanna fuck with somebody, huh? How about me, bitch? Me, FBI, CIA, Army Rangers. Get that nasty bitch from Abu Ghraib down here, huh? Looks like he's dead, huh? You'll see, bastard. Please... No! Please, please... Please, please... - Hey! - Go fuck your mother, faggot. Hey! What's going on? Where the fuck are they going? Doctor said I'm lucky. Another inch, and I'd be adios, muchachos. Try one between your fucking eyes. So I tell him about Phil and this Santillan dude. The guy goes white as a sheet, says he doesn't know what I'm talking about. Then he gives me this for my protection. Well, that's all, folks. I'm hasta la vista. Jesus, Henry, come on. You've just been shot. Think for once. I am. But I'm thinking these guys are gonna come back and finish what they started. And even the cops are scared of them. You saw. Look, if we stay here, we're sitting ducks. What about Phil? He's dead. He's dead, man. Do you have a friend who disappear? Dark hair, 20, 21? He is alive. My love. What are you doing here? I wanted to see the gringo. You've seen him. Now go. Who did this to you? Listen to me very carefully. If you touch another hair on his head... I will decorate my bedroom wall with your skin. - Understand? - Yes. I'm sorry, boss. I'm sorry. I do not believe in violence that has no purpose. I've tried to teach that to Randall, but... he's American, so it's hard. What's gonna happen to me? None of your fucking business. It's okay. In the past, I've always used Mejicanos. But the last one, he was very brave, very stubborn. So when the time came, he refused to cooperate, so the magic was bad. The gods were... unmoved. I decided... next time, instead of using a Mejicano, I would use an American. Someone young and... soft. Someone... who will give me what I need. What's that? Screams. Please, I just want to go home! No! Before Santillan smuggles his drugs to the north, he makes his drugs invisible to the border police. To do this, he make... How do you say, "un escudo mgico de sangre"? A magical shield of blood? Human blood. What? In return for the gods' protection, he gives to them a sacrifice. What the fuck? Are you saying Phil's gonna get murdered? Santillan arrived this afternoon. He will perform his ritual tonight. On the full moon. So what do we do? Go to the American FBI. Tell your story. Give to them my evidence of Santillan and his operation. If the Mexican police will do nothing, maybe yours will. You said they were gonna kill him tonight. That's not enough time. I know where is your friend. I go to the farm, do what I can. We meet in your hotel in a half hour. I'll bring the evidence. Maybe we should go with him. You know I love Phil, right? Yeah. Okay, I bust his chops sometimes, but... I thought I was gonna buy it, Eddie. Now, you wanna call me a chickenshit, you go ahead. I got it coming. I'll say it myself, dude. I'm fucking scared. I'm gonna drop Valeria off, then come back. All right. Ed, listen, man. What I said earlier... You wanna dig ditches in Africa for no money, if you ask me, you're fucking crazy, but... takes balls. Oh! Look, maybe you'd better come with us. I can't. It's not safe here, Valeria. Are you going to smuggle me across the border? All right. I'll be back as soon as I know what we're doing. I'll be here. Valeria! Get off me! What's going on? I don't know. I have no idea. Hello! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Help me! Somebody, help! Help me! Help! Open the door, lady! They're gonna kill me! - Open the fucking door, lady! - Ayl Don't fucking open it! Fuck! Help! Help me! Enough. Come on. She didn't want to talk. I made her. I made her talk! She didn't want to talk! Henry. What... What happened? Is it Henry? - Yes. - Where is he? On the roof. Hey, guy, you don't want to see him. - You can't cross the line, lady. - What happened? Okay, you must go, now. I'm coming with you. That was not our deal. I don't care about our deal. He's my friend. What's going on? Showtime, girl. It's all right. Fuck! Okay, okay, okay. So what do we do when we get there? "We"? You want me to help you, right? Ever fired a gun? Yeah. Yeah, I've fired a gun. How about shoot a man? Ever do that? Think you could? Yeah. If I had to. Is everyone here? Everybody. Then let's begin. Now we wake Chango. "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, "I will fear no evil, "for Thou art with me. "Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. "Thou preparest a meal for me "in the presence of my enemy. Thou annointest my head with oil. " - Hear me, Chango. Hear my prayer. - "My cup runneth over. " I bring you flesh that bleeds. A heart that beats in fear. "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life," A soul that cries out in pain. "And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. " If this pleases you, Then grant us the power... "And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. ...to walk in the daylight, yet still be in shadow. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. " Help me, God! Oh, my God! String him up. Stay alive. It's Phil's. Go, go, go! Hola. Remember me? A year ago in Mexico City, you had my partner killed, but you let me live. The cop? Piece of shit, you should have killed me. I did. No, you loser! Where's the boy? His body or his soul? You sick son of a bitch. Papa! Go ahead. Pull the trigger. If you have the will. You bastard. I'm going to feed you to my Nganga. You can keep the gringo company. Get out! Ulises! Get out of here, you bastards, get it? All right? Fuck! Stay down! Drive! Where's the bag? Right here. You see? Already. Hang in there. We're gonna get you some help. Ed, tell them my story. You're gonna tell it. Promise me! Hey! Hey, can you please help us? A man's been shot. Senorl Come on! Stay with me. His hand is cold. No. Oh. Ask him how far the border is. How far away is the border? Go out the front door. Two kilometers, you'll be in the water. He said... He said we walk out there, go two kilometers and we're swimming in it. Okay. We'll pack some food, we'll pack some water, we're gonna swim across. Senorl Senor? They're here. What? You saw them? Shit! Listen up, you sons of bitches! You are seriously fucked! You have no idea! You killed a great man! A god! I got a bunch of weapons out here with nothing to lose! We're gonna die. No, we won't. Right. Run. Ow! Shit! Okay, okay, okay. You stay here. I'm gonna check the back. Okay. Senor? Senor? Son of a... Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. Shit. Ed. Fuck! Come on, put the gun down! I promise I'll make it quick! Run! You like that? You know what I like to see? The look in a cunt's eyes right before I do it. Come on. Open your mouth. There you go. Gracias. See? You like that? I miss something? You're starting to remind me of my ex. No! No! Ow! Shit! Son of a bitch, that hurt! Fucker! Motherfucker! Hey. Hey, listen, man. I don't want to fight, okay? I don't want... Please. I don't want to fight you. I don't want to fight. Hey. Hey, man. Hey, no... Please, ese. No, please! No... No! Please don't... I don't... I don't want... No more. No more. Don't kill me, please. Please don't... No! The good stuff begins now. We're going to lift the spirit because you don't have to think about what we can hit. Just as the sheath raises those who fall. In this city, so full of soul, finding glory where you leave.
