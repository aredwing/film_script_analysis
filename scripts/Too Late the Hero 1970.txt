The old man wants to see you, right away. Oh, God, that's all I need. Good luck. Come in. - Excuse me, sir. - What's happened? That was Admiral Dawes on the radio, sir. - I mean, it was Admiral Dawes personally. - So? I told him what you told me, sir... that you weren't in, and we were still looking for Lt. Lawson. - And? - And that didn't seem to satisfy him, sir. It doesn't satisfy me, either. What about Lawson? - He's nowhere on the base, sir. - Look off the base. Send out the Shore Patrol. Bring him in, I don't care where he is. Yes, sir. We've done that, sir. If you've done that, there's nothing else to tell me, is there? No, sir, nothing else. I just thought you'd like to know what was going on. Lt. Lawson! If you're heading for the P.X., get us some more beer. Anybody seen Lt. Lawson? - Sam, where you going? - I thought I'd have me a little grub. - Wanna come? - No, I ate already. There he is! Lt. Lawson! Capt. Nolan wants to see you right away, sir. - Who, me? - That's right, Lieutenant. Please, sir. Get in. Yeah, I'll get in. - What does he wanna see me about? - I don't know, sir. See you tonight, girls. First come, first served. You can draw straws. Here we are, sir. - Keep the meter running, boys. - Yes, sir. - The old man wanna see me? - Boy, does he wanna see you. - Yes, sir. - Hi, John. What's all the excitement? They said you were looking for me. Is that right? By the way... how'd you make out with that funny broad at the club last night? I was under the impression that the funny broad was with you. Hell, I brought her, but she really liked you. That's why I left. I wouldn't wanna appear ungallant... but I think I'd just as soon do without your assistance in that direction. That's nice. I thought I was doing you a favor. Anyway, what's all the panic? I was just getting ready to eat. I have a job for you. What, before I go on leave? Yes, before you go on leave. All right, as long as I'm on that midday plane tomorrow. Very gracious of you, but it'll take a little longer than that. Can't, John. I got a four-weeks' leave coming. - Later. - Later nothing. High noon tomorrow, I'm on that plane. I'm gonna be in Frisco Sunday night. We're flying you out of here this afternoon. You'll be in the New Hebrides Sunday night. The New Hebrides? I've your orders here. You'll report to a British Combat Unit on one of the islands. They need someone who speaks Japanese. Combat Unit? What's that? What the hell is that? First you talk about postponing my leave, now you're talking about combat? There are three other officers in the radio section. Two of them speak better Japanese than me. - They are all a lot older than you. - That's good, they're mature. But who picked on me? I did. And it's not a question of picking on you. The British are organizing this for us... and it's gonna involve a certain amount of physical hardship. We have to supply the man. In my opinion, you're the man for the job. No, John, negative. Pick Antonelli, he likes all that military crap. Not me, no. I'm sending you, Lieutenant. "Lieutenant"? I'm Sam, don't you remember? Sit down. - Don't be... - Sit down, Lieutenant. I have to comply with an instruction from higher authority. A lot higher. In order to do that, I'm obliged to make do with the best possible personnel I have. I know you're a long way from being right for the job... but only you begin to meet the physical requirements. Fortunately, they don't appear to be concerned about much else. So pack your things and report to the Transportation Officer in 25 minutes. You mentioned a Combat Unit. I guess that means a bunch of limeys running around... playing soldier, getting shot at, right? You may not remember this or you may not be aware of it... but I volunteered for the service because as a language specialist... I was gonna get a bar on my shoulder and be able to sit by a radio... and eavesdrop on those fiendish Orientals. If they're gonna change those rules... I just might have to resign that commission. That's your privilege. And if I do... you'll have to send another officer. Right? The order specifies "Japanese-speaking personnel." If you resign your commission, the Navy would be happy to accept it... and send you out there as a Seaman Second Class. Would you like me to arrange that for you right now? Yes, sir? - I can't win, can I? - No, you can't. Incidentally, this operation is something the British are mounting for our benefit... so it wouldn't hurt to show them courtesy. - Courtesy? - That's right. You'll get along better if you don't call them "limeys." That kind of thing. I don't care whether I get along with them or not. Listen, you miserable bastard, I'm not interested in your problems. We lost two PT boats yesterday not 2 miles from that bay down there. I have to spend the rest of this day writing to folks back in the States. "Dear Mrs. Smith, a funny thing happened to your boy last night. He got burnt up." What shall I tell them? "Too bad your kid couldn't be a bit smarter. "If he spoke Japanese, we coult've gotten him a job sitting on his ass. "When this mission comes along, he'd say, 'Not me, buddy.'" Go on, get out of here. I don't have time for you. From what I hear, the British won't have time for your selfish... I hope they get your goddamn head shot off for you. I'm sure we'll get along just fine, sir. They're gonna love him. Come on, scram! - Toss it up, sir. - You guys aren't in a hurry, are you? You know something? I don't think that clown's happy in the service. Ain't it the living truth. That bum wouldn't be happy anywhere. Let's go. Okay, back it in. That's it. A little to the left. Hi. - Boat's waiting, sir. - What boat? There's your boat, Lieutenant. Thanks a whole lot. Have a nice trip, Lieutenant. Left, left, left, right, left! Makes me a bloody foolish sight. That's what. Right, left! Keep those arms up. Water's hard enough to come by. Wash out those water barrels! Get them off my square! Keep those arms free, keep those heads up! Go and get that man in the rear or I'll keep dragging you all day! Get those water barrels off my square! Okay, bookie's off the course. No more bets. Ready, set, go! Connolly. Your bleeding horse is being left at the post. That's not fair, Tosh! Why not? My jockey's only using his whip, ain't he? If your bloke doesn't wake his bloody ideas up... you're gonna owe me two packets of fags. He's right, Connolly. Even you can run faster than that pig. All the same, it isn't fair. Away and pick your nose, you mooning Mary! But it isn't fair, Campbell. Look at that! Objection! Stewart's inquiry! Gentlemen, objection sustained! This bloody horse has been doped. What the hell do you think you're playing at? Don't argue with the steward, laddie. I've a mind to report you to the Jockey Club. Leave him be. I think his brains have come loose. Yeah, you better watch it, Thornton. All right, let's have you! Cpl. McLean, get those men fell in. Scott, right marker here. One straight line, come on. - Corporal. - Sir. Away and find Pvts. Rogers, Currie, Rafferty, and Pvt. Riddle. What's up then, Sarge? Nothing to worry you. - Good morning, sir! - Howdy. Commanding Officer apologizes. He would have greeted you personally. - It's okay. - He's just come back from a reconnaissance. Col. Thompson is waiting, sir. If you'll come with me. - Lf you'll come with me, sir. - Right. I'm excused duties, Sergeant. Is that right? Listen, laddie, we've had your stripes. You make it necessary, and I will personally crucify you. You're on that list because I put you there myself. If you want a personal interview, you can have it. And you'll likely find yourself facing a court-martial... for self-inflicted wounds. Do you hear me all right, laddie? Yes, Sergeant. Tosh, what's that then? It's a bleeding Yank, isn't it? No, Connolly, that's not a Yank. That's Snow White. And very pretty she is, too. All right! You've got bugger all to laugh about. - You there, Hearne! - Sir. You're supposed to be standing to attention! This way, sir! Col. Thompson will join you in a moment, sir. All right, attention! Fall in! One, two, three, four... Good afternoon, Lieutenant. Welcome to the New Hebrides. Lt. J.G. Sam Lawson reporting... as ordered. I think we can let the Sergeant Major deal with those. Yes, rather an imaginative location for a military headquarters, don't you think? Yeah. I sometimes wonder what kind of an artist Gauguin woult've become... if he'd had the misfortune to choose this place instead of Tahiti. Yes, I think there would have been a certain lack of inspiration. Mind you, I don't know what the natives were like here... but there are none anymore. I'm sure he woult've found the current crop of inhabitants singularly unappealing. This part up here is all Japanese. Not at all jolly. And down here, we have our own group... which I imagine he woult've found only marginally more agreeable. Now, what we really have is the remainder of a Brigade HQ Company... consisting largely of chaps from my regiment... brought up to strength by a rather bizarre variety of odds and sods... who joined us when we scrambled out of Singapore. A lot of them were just as anxious to escape the Army as they were the Japanese. But I've no doubt your chaps have told you about all this. No, sir, my chaps didn't tell me anything. Recently, though, the casualty rates have been alarmingly high. However, I'm afraid this little jaunt we've organized now... is going to change all that because, amongst other things... it's going to make it necessary for us to penetrate all the way to their main base. Sounds great. When do you leave? As soon as we've briefed the men. You'll be leaving in about half an hour or so. I'll be leaving in half an hour? It doesn't do to let the men brood about these things, you know. Come in. I believe you sent for me, sir. Yes, Freddie. I wanted to have a chat with you before I talk to the men. - How are you feeling? - First rate. Good. Freddie's been on the sick list the last few days. I'm so sorry, I don't think you have met yet. This is Lt. Lawson of the United States Navy. Lt. Lawson, this is Capt. Hornsby, who'll be leading this patrol. How do you do? Glad you'll be coming along. That makes one of us. I guess this trip's unavoidable. I shall be briefing the men in a few minutes. Perhaps you'd like to get changed? I take it you did bring some other gear? This is all I got. What kind of gear? It doesn't have to be anything terribly formal. - Sergeant Major! - Sir! Take the Lieutenant down to the stores... and help him sort out something appropriate for the occasion, would you? Sir. I'm afraid our laundry service is a little bit primitive. We've been reduced to using seawater for everything but drinking... so don't be alarmed if the kit you get is a little bit manky. "Manky"? How's the grub? It's a little bit manky, too. See you later. If you'll come with me, sir? - You did say half an hour? - Yes. Yeah, I thought you said that. What an extraordinary fellow. He is an American. Yes, but he does actually speak Japanese, does he? He says so, and I certainly don't feel qualified to put him to the test. You wanted to talk to me, sir? - You said... - Yes, of course. It's nothing really. I wanted to be sure you feel up to it. Good heavens, yes. I mean, if you don't feel entirely fit yet, I can equally send O'Neill. No, sir, I'm fine. Anyway, it seems to me to be a marvelous opportunity... to really hurt them, for a change. Yes. Let's hope they're not entertaining similar ambitions. Stand to! What the hell's that? All guns and crews! All guns stand to! All guns commence fire! Keep the men out of range of the enemy, Captain. You men, keep back. Stay in the safety zone. Keep back in the safety zone. Trevor's patrol? Make sure they don't hit our lads! They'll never make it. Fire! They'll be out of enemy rifle range soon, sir. Are they out of range yet, sir? They're out of range now, sir. Keep your guns at ready. Keep your eyes on that jungle. Bloody mess. Terrible bloody mess. Medical Orderly! Stretcher bearers! A week from today... the American Navy proposes sending a convoy up through these straits. We know that the Japanese have no air reconnaissance in this area... so barring any unfortunate encounters with surface craft... the Americans' presence in these waters should remain undetected. Undetected, that is, until... early on Thursday morning... when they will come within sight of the Japanese coast up here. In the normal course of events... the Japanese would communicate this information... to their air and naval forces up here. And within 24 hours, this convoy would be pretty much at their mercy. Is that clear so far? Yes, sir. Hearne! Tosh. - What? - Him. The movements and major policy decisions of the United States Navy... may be of limited interest to you... but if you will bear with me for just a moment or two... I think you will find that it may be worth your while to pay some attention. - I am, sir. - Good. The object of our own operation is simply to prevent news... of the Americans' presence in these waters from reaching the enemy's main base. The Japanese transmit situation reports... to their bases at Rabaul and Truk on Wednesdays and Sundays. If we were to destroy their radio... before the transmission on Wednesday night... that is to say before the convoy comes within sight... of their coast here... we should know that at least that part of the mission had been successful. This is where Lt. Lawson of the United States Navy comes in. Immediately prior to Wednesday night's transmission... you will destroy the Japanese radio. Lt. Lawson will use our own radio equipment... to transmit the normal, routine situation report in Japanese. - Sir? - Yes, Hearne, what is it? Would the mission have to be abandoned... if Lt. Lawson met with... an unfortunate mishap? Mishap? Yes, I take your point... but I think it's a little premature to talk about abandoning the operation... or of any mishap to the Lieutenant, for that matter. - Yes, sir. - I hope your enthusiasm isn't catching. I hope so, too, sir. However, if it answers your question... Lt. Lawson's part in this operation is not, in fact, essential. It is merely a way of gaining additional time. Lf, for any reason, he should be unable to transmit the message... we shall still be doing a very considerable service by destroying the Japanese radio. Yes, sir. We've never attempted to penetrate this far into Japanese territory... Bloody suicide mission. Campbell. Now's the time to shoot your other arm. Knock it off. Captain, I was wondering how come Trevor didn't come that way or that way... instead of down the middle like that? - Mines, old boy. - Mines? Yeah. If the Japs ever sent a sizeable force against us... that bit of jungle over there would be too close for comfort. So we laid a mine field there... and it worked a treat for a while because it kept them out... and our patrols could come and go as they pleased. Then one night the Japs laid a few mine fields of their own. It cost us seven men before we discovered it. Isn't there any other way out of this target range? Not if you're traveling north, Lieutenant. I don't like to seem unduly cautious, but wouldn't it be better if we left at night? I'm sure the men would be the first to agree with you. - Wouldn't that make more sense? - Indeed. But if we're to reach the enemy camp by Wednesday night... we have what you might call a rather tight schedule. We had intended leaving last night... but unfortunately, your people were somewhat late in delivering the body. You mean the whole operation's been hanging on me? I'm afraid so. I'm sorry about being late, Captain, but I wasn't driving that damn boat. Patrol, attention! - Carry on, please. - Sir. Sgt. Johnstone, stand the men at ease. Stand at ease! Easy. Pay attention. If we can get across that open ground without attracting the enemy fire... we can take it that the patrol encountered by Trevor's men has withdrawn... and we should be reasonably safe until we've penetrated into the jungle. Sgt. Johnstone and I will lead off. The rest of you will break up into three groups of four... which Lt. Lawson here will dispatch at intervals of 25 seconds. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir. Cpl. McLean... you and Signalman Scott will remain in the rear group with the Lieutenant. Hearne, the same applies to you. As Medical Orderly, you will be in the last group. If there are any casualties on the way over... you will not stop to render aid to anyone... unless they are injured within 200 yards of cover. - Is that clear, Hearne? - That's clear, sir. Sgt. Johnstone, prepare to move the men off. Sir! All right, get moving. Over to the weapon pits. - You hear that, Connolly? - Move along. Don't get yourself shot till you get to the other side. Why not? Because Uncle Tosh won't be able to look after you, that's why not. All gun pits, stand to. Come on, let's hurry up. Give me three ranks! Front rank: Riddle, Thornton, Griffiths, Currie! Center rank: Rafferty, Rogers, Connolly, Campbell! Rear rank: Lt. Lawson, Hearne, Cpl. McLean, Scott! Captain, what about the four guys they left out there? If we get across safely... I imagine they'll pick them up now. And if we don't? I suppose they'll pick us all up tonight. - Sergeant. - Sir? - You ready? - Yes, sir. Right. Off we go. Twenty-five, twenty-four... twenty-three, twenty-two... Get yourself out of here... before you go, I've news for you, you're on a charge. A charge for appearing on guard duty with your boot laces undone. ...seven, six, five... You'll be on the Hebrides line-up. ...one, all right, go. If you go out in the woods today You better go in disguise If you go out in the woods today You're in for a big surprise Shut up! Stupid idiot. Thornton, what's the matter with you? My heat's sore. I'm fair daffy. I don't think that guy's playing with a full deck. What do you say, sir? I think he's lost some of his marbles. - What marbles are they, sir? - Cuckoo. - Cuckoo? ...twenty-four, twenty-three... They wouldn't let him in the army if he was cuckoo, would they, sir? No, he's all right, old Thornton. He's seen more soldiering than you've had hot dinners. He's all right. Unless, of course, he goes right off his rocker. ...seven, six... Doesn't happen often. ...five, four... - He's all right. ...three, two, one. Let's go. Twenty-five, twenty-four... twenty-three... Don't walk in a straight line, you clowns. Scatter, move to the left. Come on, spread out. Use your heads. That's great, sir. The Lieutenant's obviously done this before. You don't have to be the Duke of Wellington to know you don't walk in a straight line. That's absolutely right, sir. He's right. ...seven, six, five... four, three, two... He's right, you know. ...one. Come on. All right, you men, back to work. Spotted a relative, Campbell? Up your pipe, you Cockney ponce. Be quiet! It's marvelous, this country living. For pigs. Look at my hands. They look like chopped beef. Excuse me, sir, is there something wrong with your teeth? We call it personal hygiene. You ought to try it sometime. You hear that, lads? He reckons you're all a bunch of pigs. Cheeky bastard. May I have a light, please, Lieutenant? Here. Those two are getting pretty matey, aren't they? Why not? Like you're always saying, it's a matter of class. I don't know about Snow White... but old Hornsby's got about as much class as a syphilitic road sweeper. I really love this time of day. - It always reminds me... - It doesn't do much for me, I'll tell you. I can see you're a confirmed city dweller. My people farm, you know. - We have this little estate in the Cotswolds. - Is that right? - Sgt. Johnstone. - Sir? - It's about time we moved off. - Yes, sir. Let's have Riddle out in front. All right, Riddle, up front. Why me again? I was back marker yesterday. Keep it down, you chaps. Because you're so bloody lovely, that's why. Now don't argue! Get up front! - Connolly, you kick off as back marker. - Who, me, sir? All right, sir. Hang on here until we've been gone a full minute. Jap patrol, sir. Coming right down the path. - Five of them, this way. - Did they see you? I don't think so. Off the path, both sides. Don't fire unless I do! Captain, your field pack! We did it! Rogers, get your bloody head down! Keep down, you bloody fool. Rafferty! Rogers! Kill all those men! Griffiths! Thornton! Pick up the rifles! Come on, don't leave a trace. You heard the orders. Get a move on. Don't leave a trace. I said off the trail. Tosh, over here. Come on, clean it up. That's right. Get it out of the way. - Take him up that way. - Tosh, hurry up! Over in the undergrowth. That's right. You'll be all right, Connolly. Riddle, get off down the trail and keep cover. - Come on, Riddle, double up! - Get them off the trail. - I think Riddle's bought it. - Damn. Campbell, you get on up there. If you see any more coming... fire a warning shot and get back here on the double. - Yes, sir. - Move it, Campbell! Trying to work his ticket. It's what you're doing, ain't you? Trying to work your ticket, son? - Hearne. - What do you want, sir? What about these two? Bloody idiot. Put your hand on there and keep the pressure, all right? This one's got about five minutes. This one will be all right if we get him back to camp. But we're not going in that direction, are we? No, sir. All right, Sergeant... do we have any other casualties? The Yank says Pvt. Riddle's dead, sir. - Is that all? - No, it's not all. Currie and Connolly. - Both dead? - No. What the hell do you mean, idiot? Can't you speak plainly? Currie's dead! Connolly's wounded. Right, Sergeant, get these Japanese bodies off the trail, please. You heard. Get these bodies off the trail. Come on, move! And erase those bloodstains. Never you mind. Hearne's taking good care of you. Come on, Rogers, get a move on. I hear you're something of a footballer, Connolly. Before you know it, you'll be back home... playing for the regiment, perhaps. I don't know whether I ever... You shouldn't have given up smoking, Connolly. You coult've had a drag now. Get those helmets. I got his leg. Take him up that way, towards the right. Scott, give us a hand. - Don't take all day, man. - Yes, sir. The helmet, you damn fool! That pretty well cleans it up, sir. It's been a great day at Hampden Park, folks. Hornsby's Hotspurs: 5... Japanese United: 3. All eight of them scored by Hornsby. What's he mean, all eight of them? He means that Fairy Feet Hornsby... deployed his forces with such a masterly grasp of tactics... half of us got ourselves shot by the other bloody half. No, it can't be. Can't be? Go and dig the bullets out. You won't find "Made in Japan" written on them. All right, Sergeant, let's be on our way. Come on, men. Rafferty. Back marker. Let's have a bloody good cry And always remember Come on, move it. The longer you live The sooner you'll bloody well die Look at the mourners Bloody great hypocrites Isn't it grand, boys Don't you know any other songs? Aye, a few... but at the moment, I happen to be particularly fond of this one. I wish you'd sing us one you hate. Campbell, has it ever occurred to you that if you had the other arm broken... you'd be needing a friend to button your fly? Capt. Hornsby! Over here! Japs! Where are you? We're coming after you, you bloody little ape! Come on, Captain, the bastart's getting away! Get your blinking face here, or we'll all be done for! Hearne! Come on, show yourself! Two of them coming down there, a lieutenant and a corporal. I got the corporal. I winged the other one, too. Could be dead now. - Where did he go? - Disappeared in there. Hearne, see what you can do for him. Corporal, take some men and start combing the area. - Four of you on the double. - He's got to be in the jungle somewhere. Campbell, you and Scott take a look from this tower. See if you can spot anything from up there. Lieutenant, you better come with me. - Come on. - I can't go up there. - You and your bloody arm. - Go on, get on with it. It's a bloody mile high. What's up there, then? Just some things for measuring the weather or something. It's like the stuff we've got back at camp. Damn you, Hearne! Shall I bring them down? No, leave them. If Hornsby sees them, he'll have us lugging them all the way back to base. Don't worry, Thorny. Snakes love Japs. You'll have to go to Woolworth's and buy one, I think. We're never gonna find him in this. Let's get back. It seems your friend is on his way back to Tokyo. - Hearne. - What? How about it? - Can he walk? - No, sir. - But, surely... - No. Right, give him a hand. Come on, now. What's the matter with you? Can't you see that I can't put my foot down? There's hundreds of these trails. How're we ever gonna find him again on our way back? It's easy. We're gonna scatter little white pebbles through the forest... just like bloody Hansel and Gretel. Carry on, Gunga Din. This thing weighs a ton. Ease him down over there. Sorry we couldn't have the Rolls Royce for you. Just thought you might need this. Thank you, sir. Good luck, Sergeant. - Corporal. - Sir? There. Okay? All done. - Here. - What's this, then? - Salt tablets. - I'd rather have a smoke. - You short, then? - Skint. Hearne, we've got to go. I'll see you Saturday, okay? Yeah. Thanks. Not for the cigarettes though. You owe me them. Don't you bloody forget it. I won't. And don't forget to loosen the tourniquet, otherwise your bloody leg will drop off. See you. Enjoy your rest, Sergeant. I reckon that makes you a Sergeant, Jock. - Down there? - Yes, sir. All right. Hearne, Campbell, come with me. Well, move yourself, Campbell. I knew that little Nip had to be in there. What? - Cover me. - All right. They've gone. Let's move on. Did you hear me? There's no one here. Let's move on. Look out! It's not every day you get a chance to kill an officer, is it, Lieutenant? All he had was this knife. What did you want me to do? Wait till he threw it at you? No. No! It's me, Campbell! What the hell do you want? You asked for these, sir. You idiot. You coult've got yourself killed, running up like that. Come on, let's get moving. Let's go. Where are you off to? You're still back marker, remember? Bugger off, you Yank bastard. I hope you bloody crash! - How do you know it's a Yank, kid? - You can smell them. I thought all you limeys could smell was our money. Hearne, Lieutenant, Cpl. McLean, come with me. Keep them here a moment. Rogers. Can you see him? Where the hell is he? You might say he's all around here. As a matter of fact, you might even say he's got us surrounded. That's right, Lieutenant. The bloody Yanks are bombing us with old Army boots. Land mine. The damn fool shoult've known better. Here, look at this. It's a Chinese railway station, crabs and all. Thornton, away in and find out what time is the next train to Glasgow. "Next train to Glasgow." What's going on up there? For Got's sake, keep quiet. Keep moving! Corporal, send in two men to see if there's anyone in there. Thornton, over there on the left. Rafferty, over there on the right. They kind of move sideways. Must be Oriental crabs. Lieutenant, will you join me? They'll ruin your married life, won't they? Here, give them a peck, Campbell. A man ought to be close to his family. Shut your trap. All clear on the ground floor, sir. Rafferty's up top. Keep them things away from me. Campbell, get rid of the crabs. Why me, you dafty queer? - That kid that got it back there... - Rogers? Yeah, Rogers. Do you think he ever had time to get himself laid? Couldn't tell you. Not my department really, is it? I may be screwed up in a lot of ways... but getting killed like one of these poor kids isn't gonna be one of them. That's what you say now. But I'm sure when it comes to the point, you'll be one of the first over the top. Over the top? I mean, you'll turn out to be a real fire-eater. You wanna bet? I'll give you 8-to-5. And loan you the money. You never get rid of those with blue ointment, kids? Time to relieve Griffiths, mate. It's your sentry go. Griffiths, back there. Takes a bloody bomb to wake him up. An earthquake's more like it. Here, Tosh, give us a light. What the hell are you doing? - Where'd you get these cigarettes? - What's that to you? - You stole them from Johnno, didn't you? - Don't be bloody daft! Where'd the blood come from then? You did, you bastard, you stole them! He's got no use for them now. What's the matter? - They're mine, that's what! - Piss off! - Don't "piss off!" me! - Campbell, stop it. Get out, Tosh! That's it. Out! Cut it out, Tosh. What's the meaning of this disgusting exhibition? I'll kill him! He kicked me, sir. It's my arm, sir. He kicked my arm. Kick his arm? I'll jam it down his bloody throat! I gave Sgt. Johnstone these cigarettes. Shut up, Hearne. Nobody's talking to you. - I'm bloody well talking to you, aren't I? - What did you say? I said that he stole these cigarettes... I'm not interested in your grubby little cigarettes. You bloody well should be! Cpl. McLean, put this man on a charge. Let's have no more of this nonsense. Where does he think he is, bloody Aldershot? Hearne, it seems you're not going to be satisfied... until you've talked yourself into some really serious trouble. - Is that what you want? - All I want is to get out of here. If you had any sense, you'd know we shoult've turned back a long time ago. Thank you. Have you anything to add to that? Yes, I have, sir. Your last patrol was a bloody shambles. Getting this one shot up the ass isn't gonna win you any medals. So why don't you go home like a good boy before you get the lot of us killed? I don't know about you, but I have better things to do! Thank you. I shall cherish that bit of advice. Corporal, this man is under open arrest. When you get back to camp, you will prepare charges for a field courts-martial. Are you satisfied, Hearne? Easy. Watch yourself, laddie. That wee man's near daft enough to have you shot. All right, Corporal, prepare to move off in five minutes. Sir. Rafferty, go and get Griffiths. All right, front marker, move out. It seems some of the men have just as little enthusiasm for their duties as you do. Maybe they didn't volunteer for the assignment either. No, they didn't. Since this entire operation was for the benefit of the United States Navy... they probably find the object of the exercise extremely remote. Furthermore, they're just as anxious to get home as you are. Is that what you're gonna do now? Go home? Fact is, it doesn't matter how you feel about something before the event. You may very well feel it's a waste of time. For all I care, you could be a long-haired conscientious objector. In that case, you should have had the guts to say so in the first place. Is that right? The fact remains, that once you're involved... you have a certain responsibility to the people around you. They depend on you. And that's something that none of your sophisticated arguments can get around. Do you understand what I mean? Yeah, I hear you talking. But you still haven't answered my question. Scott! Yes, sir. All right, Corporal, move the men out. ...otherwise you'll wake up Snow White and the Fairy Prince. Don't talk so daft. I just wanna get home like the rest of you. Why don't we do that? Why don't we all just bugger off home? We could always say... that old Fairy Feet and Snow White got lost. Think. In six months' time... the Japs will still be sitting in this part of the jungle... and we will still be sitting in our part of the jungle... and none of this will have made a blind bit of difference. You're joking, ain't you? That's right, Scottie. I'm always joking. All right, this is it. Who gets to stay up? And we'll separate at this fork in the trail here. I shall take Lt. Lawson, Hearne and Scott to deal with the radio shack. Cpl. McLean will lead the rest of you... to the southern section where the barracks are concentrated. Your job will be purely a diversionary one. As far as we can see, there's only one radio operator. Ideally, we would put him out of commission just before midnight... and then keep quiet until the Lieutenant... has sent his message on our own transmitter. If all goes well, we'll destroy their transmitter immediately after midnight... and pull back without calling for any help from your people. All right, let's be on our way. Remember, any disturbance you hear before midnight... will require diversionary action from you. If you hear nothing after the one big explosion... you can pull back without revealing your position. - Right? - Right, sir. Lieutenant, will you lead off, please? Let's go, Scott. Good luck. Let us have you. Come on, we've just got 15 minutes. Get your fingers out! I'm coming. And remember, be quiet. Sir. Tosh! Hearne, you stupid idiot! - How is it? - I'm just looking, sir. Come on. Oh, God, please. No. How about it? It's useless, sir. There's at least three valves smashed. - Valves? - "Tubes" to you. - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. Hearne, you bastard! You did that deliberately. No, I didn't, Mr. Hornsby. You'll address me properly, do you hear? Do you hear? Yes, I hear you, sir... and so will the Japs, if you don't keep your bloody voice down. I'm very sorry, sir, but there was nothing I could do. Dump that thing in the bushes! We're late already. Out of my way. - Any spares? - No. Go on. Down there, under the hut. Hurry. They got a bleeding generator grinding away. Lights on all over the place. Not expecting visitors, are they? Spread out. Take cover. Let's not wake them up. You gonna use grenades, Captain? May not be too easy. Might bounce against those screens. Yeah. I suppose they might. - Scott. - Sir? Do you think, I mean, given a chance... that you could operate the kind of transmitter they've got in there? I'll have to have a look at it, but it's probably basically the same thing. Good. I think we might give it a try. Give what a try? If the three of us could get in there unnoticed... I could dispose of him... and you two could send back our fake message on their transmitter. Rather a nice touch of irony, don't you think? What're you trying to pull, Captain? That wasn't in our orders. No, Lieutenant. It's evident that one of us has to get in there in any case... to make sure of destroying their transmitter. So why not go the whole hog? Our orders were damn plain, Captain. We were to send the message on our transmitter. If that didn't work out, we were to destroy theirs. But nobody said a damn thing... Do be quiet. I'm going over there to deal with the operator. When you see me come back to the window, you and Scott will join me. We'll send our message, destroy their transmitter, and leave. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir. No, sir. I'm having no part of it, Captain. You're disobeying orders and going beyond your authority. You'll do as you're told. What about that sentry, sir? Keep him covered, but don't shoot unless he does. - Not even if he sees me. - Even if he sees you? I'm going to walk straight across there. Even if he does see me, he's quite likely to assume I'm one of his chaps. - Sir. - What is it? You'd look a lot less English without that hat on. Captain! I'm telling you now. You're going against Col. Thompson's orders. If you go in there, I'm not going with you. You hear me? I haven't got time to argue, Lieutenant. You know what you have to do. There he is. What's the matter? You heard me tell him I'm not going in there. We're running out of time. What's the matter with you? I told him. Come on, Scott. Let's go! - Are you ready to transmit yet? - I think so, sir. - Where the devil's the Lieutenant? - I don't know, sir. Lawson! I told him. I know you did. But they're in there now, waiting for you. Go on, get moving! Come on, move! Where's the Lieutenant? How the hell should I know? I haven't seen him. Have you? Of course I haven't. Then let's go. I don't know. You can please yourself, what you do. I'm off. I'm not waiting around for that rubbish sack. Coming in, Hearne. What're you doing? You're supposed to be gone three minutes ago. Yes, sir. I was only waiting for you because I thought you... Blimey. This is a turn-up for the book. Oh, God, looks like the whole Japanese Air Force out there. Look at that. Like the swing shift at Lockheed. I don't believe it. Three rousing, great cheers for American Air Reconnaissance. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on. Get me out of here! What're you stopping for? - Which way? - To the right, go around. - Come on. - Go around. To the right, come on! Give us covering fire, Thornton. - What's that? - Scatter. Good afternoon, gentlemen. This is Major Yamaguchi... who has the pleasure of addressing you. No doubt you are quite amazed to hear my voice. In order to be sure... that you are hearing me... I was obliged to make this speech five times today. But tomorrow, as we close in on you... you will hear only four such speeches. On Saturday... if you have not already been killed or captured... only two. Captured? If you look at your map, you will see... that as you travel south... towards your base... your situation is like that of water... in a funnel. What's he on about? Do you understand? Like water in a funnel. No matter where you may now be, or which route you take... you will eventually wish to emerge at your base. As the funnel narrows... as you get closer to home... we will have less and less area to cover... in our search for you. We have found your abandoned radio transmitter. We know our air power in this area... came as a surprise to you... and you must communicate this information to your base. But this will not happen. Within three days... you will all be killed or captured. There is, however, an alternative. You should consider it carefully. If you will all surrender now... just one week from today, by which time... your plans and ours will be an open secret... you will be released... and allowed to return to your own base. This offer is a reasonable one. Certainly you should consider it carefully. But, remember, it must be all of you. There can be no exceptions. I shall speak to you again tomorrow, by which time... I hope that good sense will have prevailed. If you wish to take advantage of our offer... you will fire a single shot as a signal. Up your khyber. That is all. Good day, gentlemen. And good day to you, you malignant yellow dwarf. They must be right behind us. If that amplification's strong enough, they could be a helluva long way. What do you think, sir? About what? It seems like they're on to us. Do you think they mean what they're saying? Don't be bloody stupid. He did say they'd treat us all right. They'll chop your bloody head off. Since when have you been an expert? What do you know about it, bigmouth? A sight more than you do, pig face. I saw what they did in the hospital in Singapore. You were so busy running you never even saw a Jap... let alone what they did to our lads. They won't take us to a rest camp now that we know where that airstrip is. He's right. - Damn right. Now let's get out of here. - Okay, come on. All right, move out. All right, get some sleep. God, I'm tired. Got to sleep. Got to. Good morning, gentlemen. This is Saturday. And the funnel in which you are trapped is rapidly narrowing. I anticipated that you'd accept my terms. Instead, you evidently marched... throughout the day, and, perhaps, most of the night. A remarkable effort. Your leader must be a man of great determination. You have very little reason to be pleased with him... because his stubborn determination... has inspired me... to alter the terms of our offer. This offer now has a time limit. You have until sundown to surrender. After that, you will be killed on sight. In war, one must take harsh measures. I'm sorry if you do not like these new rules... but the responsibility rests with your leader. Remember, you have only to fire a single shot. But please remember also... that any surrender must include all of you. You understand? All of you. I will give you a few minutes to consider your decision. How about it now, Lieutenant? What? Quit? No way. They're not getting their hands on me. This time tomorrow, I'll be back at that camp. I don't think you know what you're talking about. Even the Jap said it was all your fault. I think we should turn in. - What do you say, Thornton? - Look, mate... I couldn't give a bugger about the Yank's reasons for wanting to carry on... because I happen to know they're half-baked anyway. And if you want to believe that Jap, you can, but they're not gonna get me. I'd sooner shoot you than trust them. As a matter of fact... much sooner. How do you know the Japs are lying? What makes you think they're all that different from us? That's right, kid, they're not. That's why that Jap Major could be lying, just like I would. You remain indecisive. I am sorry. Perhaps when you have rested... you will feel different. But the conditions remain the same. You have until dusk to give yourselves up. That is all. I knew it. He wants to draw our fire and kill us all. How do you know that's what he said? Wanna wait a couple of minutes? They'll be here. - In that case, now's the time to pack it in. - Watch it, darling. They're coming. - Clear that place. - Get down! Knife. Come on, let's get out of here. Get him out of there. Quick, damn it. - Come on, you guys, give us a hand. - Get him out of there. - Griffiths, get my pack. - Yes, sir. - McLean! - Yes, sir? Get behind him. Pick him up and get him up the hill. Come on. Move down. - He can't move. - Come on. Quick, hurry up. Come on, damn it. Move your ass! Come on! - Move! - That's the way. I'll lead them off up here. That's the way. Day and night, service is on hand, sir. Come on, boys. Don't drop him now. Watch out for those man-eating trout. Easy. You weigh a bleeding ton. That's it. Easy, Thorny. Tosh, my old buddy, how does it look back there? It's not so bad. You'll be all right. What kind of nonsense is that, man? I can feel where the scorching thing went in, and I can't feel where it came out. Yeah, you are leaking a bit. Hold up! That makes your eyes water, doesn't it? - Is that tight enough? - Yeah. Right, now put your little pinkie on the knot. That's right. Very pretty. I'm ready for my coming-out ball. You'll get "coming out" in a minute. Take your finger away when I say, "Go." Ready, steady, go. There we are. I shouldn't worry about it. No, you shouldn't, but maybe I should? That bloody Yankee poonagger's not coming back. That's all right. Thornton's not going anywhere, are you, Jock? No, I'm having my change of life. - Can he walk? - Only on the water. Yeah. That's it then. Do you hear that, lads? If anyone's going mad... We've either got to leave him here or turn ourselves in, right? I already told you, nobody's turning it in. What are you gonna do with him? You can't bloody carry him back, can you? You're so bloody clever, Hearne. What are you gonna do with him? Listen, you poxed-up Glaswegian queer! It's bad enough sitting here full of bloody holes... without listening to you open your ugly face! Knock it off. I can hear you halfway down the trail. - What's the matter with you guys, anyway? - It's Thornton, sir. He can't walk. I was just saying we've either gotta leave him here or turn ourselves in. Now, suppose you let me worry about that? Meanwhile, you just rest your toes because we're leaving before dark. - Back in a minute, Thorny. - Thanks, Tosh. That bloot's worth bottling. Look at that pair. I see Snow White's found his first dwarf. A right teddy bear's picnic this has turned out to be. - How long has Thornton got? - I don't know. But he won't be here next week, that's for certain. Where are you going? Where are you off? You know what that Yank's gonna do, don't you? - What? - He's not leaving you here alive. He'd sooner kill you himself. - Kill me? - Why shouldn't he? All he cares about is getting back to the camp. He doesn't give a bugger about you. I heard him say so. Go to hell. The only thing to do to get you out of here safely... to see you're looked after, is to turn ourselves in. I'll go with McLean and Griffiths and talk to the Japs. You try that and I'll shoot you myself. Don't be daft, man. - What else is there? - You cowardly pig. You just want to save your own skin, you hear me? Now look here, Thornton. For Got's sake, man... can't you even leave a fellow in peace? I'm sorry. I really am. I was only thinking of you. Come on, take a wee drop of water. Come on, now. I'll hold it up for you. Come on, drink it now. McLean! Quickly! Wake up! Wake up! Thornton's had it! There's no telling what the Yank will do now. What is it? Come on, wake up. - What's the matter? - Thornton's dead. Come on! - What about Tosh? - Leave him. You can't leave Tosh. Once we get to the Japs, we'll all be all right. Him as well. Wake up! Wake up, you stupid bastard! Where the hell are they? How the bloody hell do I know? You're the one who's supposed to be on guard. Stupid, dirty bastards! - You going after them? - No, it's too late. They're probably closer to the Japs than we are. The only way they'll stay alive is by telling that Jap Major where we are. Come on, let's go. Good afternoon, gentlemen. From what your comrades have told me... I may assume that you are now hearing me. As you must know... your comrades decided to try and save their lives... by surrendering and informing us of your position. But you escaped... and so their fate is still in doubt. Their surrender is of little value unless you choose to join them. If you will surrender before dark... I shall keep my word. You will be well treated... and released in only a few days. The man, Campbell, did not merit such good treatment. He was found to be carrying the personal effects of one of our officers... our Communications Lieutenant... who has been missing since last Tuesday. His body was discovered yesterday. Our Lieutenant was very popular with his men. You would understand that there was little I could do to restrain them... even if I had wanted to. It has been an incident in which none of us can take pride. However, the real problem still remains. You must decide what you want done with the two comrades... who are still our prisoners. It is for you to say if they shall live. If you wish to stay alive... you must persuade your two friends to surrender. Do you understand? Yes, sir. You may talk to them. Lieutenant? Tosh? It's me, McLean. It's right, what the Major was saying. About Campbell, I mean. They showed us the stuff he stole from the officer... and how he chopped his finger off to get the ring. There wasn't anything anyone coult've done to stop them. But we're all right. It is necessary for you to persuade them. I know we shouldn't have gone off with Campbell like we did. And I know we shouldn't have told them where you were hiding... but it was Campbell's idea, and we thought it was for the best. Listen, if you don't give yourselves up now... we'll be the ones who end up paying for it. Your Corporal is giving you excellent advice. There is no longer a choice for any of you. Either you surrender and live... or if you attempt to postpone the inevitable... then I shall withdraw my offer... and your two comrades will die tonight. The decision is yours. You have until nightfall to decide. Please, Lieutenant... do like he says. Tosh, please! I couldn't care less what they do to those two. Whatever that Jap's gonna do, he's gonna do. It's got nothing to do with what we're gonna do. If you mean it ain't gonna make us surrender... I'm with you. But if you think we're gonna try and get back to camp by tomorrow... you must be bloody mad. That's exactly what we're gonna do. We hit that clearing on the edge of that camp... if there are two of us... we're gonna have twice as much a chance of getting through. And, buddy boy... you're going with me every step of the way. Listen, Lieutenant... neither of us wants to get killed, right? I've never believed any of the guff that Jap's been giving us, either. I know once he lays his hands on us... he'll finish us off, no matter what he says. So, up until now... the only way of staying alive was getting back to camp. But now there's another way. Something that nobody else thought of. Nobody except me, that is. - What? - It's very simple. We double back, head north for two or three hours... duck off the trail, sleep for a couple of days... and we'll be laughing. - Laughing? - Yeah, laughing. Because once the Jap dive bombers... get stuck into the Yank ships Monday morning... the Jap Major won't be looking for us anymore. Right? He couldn't care less where we are then. We can just lie low for a couple of days... stroll back into camp... and nobody will say a dickie bird. What's so bad about that? I never asked those idiots to send me out here. But if I ever get back, it'll be: "Well done, Hearne. "Jolly good show. "Now you can piss off home... "back to whatever dirty little hole you came from." And what are they gonna do for you, Lieutenant? Make you the bloody President? No. Getting ourselves killed... isn't going to make any difference to anybody except us. Look, Yank... the last thing that Jap Major is gonna be looking for... is us heading north. So what do you say? You got any idea how many guys will get killed on those ships... if we haven't got the guts to try and stop them? Okay, so a couple of hundred Yanks will get the chop. - They shouldn't have joined, should they? - Hundreds? Thousands. In any case, it's not the bloody Yanks you're worried about... because if their chances depend on us getting back... they've just about had it in the first place. No, what's got you jumping about like a frog with a bullet up its ass... is old Fairy Feet Hornsby... because you reckon you let him down. And that's the one bloody time you've been right. You did. You might just as well have killed him yourself. But getting us killed isn't gonna make up for that. So Hornsby is your problem. And those Yank sailors are your problem. And if you wanna start playing bloody heroes... I've got another problem for you. I'm not bloody well coming with you. You forgot your problem. Me. I told you before... one of us has gotta get back there alive. And if you don't go with me, I'll have to leave you here. Dead. Understood? Understood. Just don't forget. Gentlemen, your time is up! I shall give you 30 seconds. If you do not give yourselves up... I shall be forced to execute your two comrades. Let me talk to him. Listen to me, Lieutenant, please. You've gotta listen to me. They're gonna kill us. Just like they killed Campbell. Please, Lieutenant, don't let them do it. Do you really find it so easy to believe that I would shoot you? Keep going. Get up. There's not much further to go. How the hell would you know? There can't be. No more, thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Get up, you limey son of a bitch, or I'll kick your head in! Get up. Good morning, again. You must be very tired. You have come a long way during the night. A truly remarkable effort. Remarkable, but to very little purpose. Shut up, you slimy yellow nob. You have moved fast... but we have moved faster. You will find that you are now very near the open field... that serves as a perimeter to your base. But some of my men are already on that perimeter. In short, you are now totally surrounded. You are now at the very tip of the funnel I have talked about so often. I can understand your determination... but to give up your lives for an objective... which cannot be won is a foolish waste. You have shown yourselves to be brave soldiers. It shows us that you are intelligent ones also. Give yourselves up and live. I assure you, the medals they give to dead heroes are made of brass. All they do is add weight to your coffin. You bloody idiot! Believe me... your situation is truly hopeless. All trails leading back into the jungle are under guard. This means... that you can no longer hide... you can no longer double back on your tracks. What's that all about? Better get the Sergeant Major. I shall give you three minutes during which time... you will wish to confirm for yourselves... that what I have said is true. At the end of that time... you must either surrender or die. You will fire a single shot to indicate that you have surrendered. Or my men will close in and kill. Stand to! - What is it? - Don't know what it is, Sergeant Major. Get Col. Thompson! Double! - Get the Color Sergeant. - Yes, Sergeant Major. What the hell is it? - What is it, Sergeant Major? - I don't know what it is. I've sent for the old man. - You better man the weapon pits. - Right. Come on, let's have you fast now! What do you think this is, Kensington Gardens? Come on! - Get in with that gun! - Get in there. Make sure the men stay back, Sergeant. You men know the drill! Keep back! Stay out of enemy range! Laid on! - Morning, sir. - Morning, Sergeant Major. - Everything in order? - Yes, sir. - Mortars? - All weapon pits are manned, sir. Sounds like loudspeakers of some kind. Got any more bright suggestions? My patience is growing very short. He must think we've still got a chance. - Who must? - Guchi. Why are they giving us three minutes? Why don't they just come and get us? Yeah. Why? I don't know. Maybe they're spread too thin. Maybe they're afraid to come in, for fear of chasing us out in the open. Yeah, and having to waste all those bullets to shoot us? Maybe. But there's still two of us... and one of us just might make it. You now have only two and a half more minutes. We could sure use some covering fire. - Think your guys will be doing anything? - Yeah. Having breakfast. We could use all the help we can get. Maybe if we fire that shot... - Why waste a bullet? - What do you mean? Fire one shot and maybe we'll confuse the Japs a bit. But if we could kill their Major... they wouldn't have anyone to tell them what to do. They'd be running about all over the place. Might give us a head start. And that little bastart's been asking for it for a long time, hasn't he? This way. Two minutes. You now have only one and a half more minutes, gentlemen. - Stand them to, Sergeant. - All guns stand to! The rest of you keep back! Out of enemy range! It worked. They've gone back. Don't forget to zigzag. You zig, I'll zag. Look there! There they are! Can you make out which ones they are? Lay down covering fire, Sergeant! Hurry! Give those men covering fire! Correct right, Sergeant! Three turns more right! More left! Come on! - He's all right. - He's alive. - He's getting up. - He's alive! Cease fire! All guns cease fire! Machine gunners, stand by to give us covering fire! Take it easy, lad. Were there any other survivors? Was it just the two of you? Who was that with you out there? I said... who was that with you out there? Out there... he was a bloody hero. He killed... fifteen bleeding Japs... single-handed. Killed fifteen? Thirty, if you like.
