Rule number two, don't ever ask a spirit how you're gonna die. Last rule, you never, ever leave the board without saying goodbye. This is a bad idea. Why don't you show yourself? Huh? B D R M. It's short for bedroom. How did we possibly forget to say goodbye? It's the first rule. LyNette, is that you? Get the damn camera out of my face! I don't understand. - It was the board. I don't need no little, weird spirit ghost runnin' around my house. Hey, who in here? Shane, is that you? Some believe that certain spirits remain on our plane and contact the living for the purpose of relaying certain messages. Those messages usually pertain to unresolved conflicts or issues. Oh, my God. All right, all right. Okay wait. One, two, three, go. Where is it? It's right here. Do I just throw it in? - Yes! - Okay! Hey, good-lookin'. How you doin' today? LyNette. Oh, Jesus. Holy sh... What the fuck is goin' on? What's goin' on? No. Well, my name is Ty, I am the theater manager and we have a special surprise for you here at the Ritz Theater. We have some of the cast members here with us. Come up here, guys! So, how is everybody doing? Doing good? Doing good? All right, guys, my name is Justin Armstrong and I played Michael in The Ouija Experiment. Yo, what's up, everybody? My name is Eric Wendell and I played C to the A, to the L, to the V I N, Calvin. Enough of that. Hi, everyone, my name is Swisyzinna and I played LyNette in the movie. Mm-hmm. Right. And I think that I can speak for all of us when I say a big thank you to the historical Ritz Theater for bein' such gracious hosts to us for premiering The Ouija Experiment, and to Ty, you are a great host as well, and to all of you for being amazing fans. Thank you so much. Give yourself a hand. We love you all. Thank you. Anyone have any questions for any of the actors? Yeah. What's your question? I was wondering, uh, if... Zina... Zinna, it's Zinna, sweetie. Sorry, um. I was wondering if Zinna... Can you please speak up? Thanks. Sorry, I was wondering if you were actually scared when you were shooting your scenes? You looked like you were really scared. Was that for real? Yes, I was scared for real. That was not acting, okay? Zinna and LyNette are the same exact person when it comes to that... Thank you, thank you. Anyone else? Yeah? I was wondering if all of the stories about the theater being haunted were true. - What do you mean exactly? - Did she say haunted? This theater really isn't haunted. the story about the family who used to own the theater. They had a baby that was born a monster, and it fed upon humans as food? They say you can still hear its ghost after midnight, wandering around in chains, growling and moaning, looking to feed again upon unsuspecting theater-goers in these very aisles, not having a clue of the horror that could be in store for them. Boo! Oh! Please welcome our monster of the evening, and your horror host for tomorrow night, Danny Gray! Hi, everybody! Welcome to Ouija Ouikend! I'm Danny and this is our lovely assistant, Elena. Okay, so, the scares do not just end tonight. Tomorrow we'll be having a haunted tour of the Ritz Theater. Now, you may wonder, hmm, do we have anything else in store? Yes we do. We placed a flyer- a winning flyer underneath one of your seats. So check now and see if you are a winner! Huh? Anybody? - I got it! - Hey! - What's your name? I'm Michelle. - Congratulations, Michelle. Michelle, you have just won two tickets extra for the overnight fright tour! You are going to be spending that night... ...with the cast from The Ouija Experiment! That night will be filled with chills, creepy noises, thrills, and, of course, bragging rights for you to tell everybody that you are the winner and they are not. All right everybody, there's tickets in the lobby for the haunted tour. I'll see everybody tomorrow. ...and you have a frightful Ouija Ouikend, everyone! Thank you so much for coming! So, you know you're going with me, right? I'd be kind of pissed if I wasn't, but who else are we gonna bring? Uh, I'm not sure yet. Um, who so you think? Um, let's see, we can maybe do Marcus. What about Tyrone? ooh, Israel. Ignacio. Ignacio. No, not another one of your two-day relationships. They're so cute, though. Like, really cute. Like, hella, totes, way cute. Okay, I'm gonna be right back. Hi. You're Margo, right? Uh, yeah. Um, I won the overnight thing tomorrow night, and I'm gonna go with my friend, Drew, and I was wondering if you wanted to come with us. Um, thanks, I'm- I'm all right, though. Thank you. Oh, why not? Uh, just 'cause. I haven't lived here that long and I could really use a new friend. People think that I'm... weird. Well, who cares what they think. I don't think you're weird. Not yet. Sorry, what'd you say? Uh, nothing, uh. I can't go, but thank you. Um, Margo, you asked a really good question inside. Did you invite her? What's with the attitude? Yes, I invited her. She's not coming. You know, that might be for the best. Why do you say that? Uh, because she's weird. I dunno, she's like a total stoner, or something. She has these moments where she, like, completely zones out. I dunno, she's just kind of off. Well, Mr. Only Male in Home Ec class, people think you're weird and I still hang out with you. You know, that is totally different. - Why? - Because I'm totes fab. Ah, okay, let's get a pizza. Michelle. Oh, yeah? I'll go with you guys. Okay, see you tomorrow. See ya. So, you and Justin can be here tomorrow at seven? Yeah, that sounds good. So, we'll be acting but not acting? I mean, we'll be improvising, right? but we're just gonna make it seem like it's really haunted, So, it the same outline and story from the post online? Yes, but hold on a second on that, because Danny's the one who knows all the details, and I think he's added some stuff. Let me check with him very quickly, okay? Okay, thanks. Hell, Danny, you there? There is a story line? I did not get that email. Did you get an email? That's because it's not an actual email, it's on a group web page. There's a web page? Uh, yeah. The one that we were supposed to join so they could send us all the information? You didn't join it? Join it? Uh, Z, I never found it. I looked everywhere. I was on MySpace, I was on Facebook, I Grammed and Tweeted it, I InstaBooked it. I looked everywhere for it, okay? Ouija Weekend Wellington, Texas. I searched for hours. It doesn't exist. Uh, did you spell both words with O U I? Ouija Ouikend? You know, like those ghetto-ass shirts you just bought that say Ouija Ouikend? They're not that ghetto. - It's spray painted. - And? And leaking. Look, the studio gave you $500 to make T-shirts and that's what you did? What'd you do with the money? Okay, you know, what? You're makin' this personal. This is not about me. I need you to just focus and move forward. Get it together. What matters is what do I do now? Uh, smart would tell me uh, that you should come in first thing in the morning and rehearse as much as you can. Look, you have a lot of lines with Eric too. Are you trying to get the studio top fire you? No, no, no. Okay, okay, okay. Do you think Eric would be open to rehearsing with me in the morning, early? I don't know. It's Eric. Speaking of which, where is Eric? Who knows? Sorry, it's me. Oh, my God, you scared me! Um, sorry. Ty told me that you guys wanted to know a little bit about tomorrow. He does. I'm headed home. Oh, and I- I have these props for you for tomorrow. Oh, sweet! Okay. Here. Oh, thank you. Oh, that's awesome. And which way is out? - Um, you know, just follow me. - Okay. Okay, so, the premise of everything is exactly... Wait a second. Both of you are on the home page? The group page? - Yes. - Of course. Okay, so, what's going on is we're changing things up. I don't want the normal, you know, where everybody is like, "Okay, let's go into this room and then... Ha! You know, I don't want that. I don't want that. We're gonna change it up. We're gonna make it even cooler. So, instead of going to the back room, or, no, actually, instead of going to the concession stand, we're gonna go to the back room. - Okay. - Got it. Yeah. No, wait, wait, wait. I have to know this before we go any further. What's your favorite part? Out of what I sent, you know, what's your favorite part? My- You want... My- Of course... - What's your... - Mine? - Justin, your favorite part. - Um... - From what he said. - From the home page? - So, I really liked that, uh- The one part when the guy... - Which part? - I'm tellin'. Um, when the guy, he's with those- those girls, and he scares them. You know what I'm talking' about. You're kidding me. That's my favorite part, too. You're gonna love this, then. - Awesome! this is actually- this is what you just gave me. It's called a ghost box. - Uh huh? You are shitting me. Eric! Excuse me. Where have you been? I was over here talkin' to Selena. Elena. Elena, right, yes, Elena. Elena, meet Zinna, Justin and Danny. Hi, how ya doin'? Nice to meet you, Elena. Hey, listen I'm headed home, okay? I need you guys to know that we have a really big night tomorrow... ...and I want both of you guys to be there on time. Okay, Zinna, we'll be here. You got it. Whatever you need. Unbelievable. If I remember right, this is supposed to be the basement. Okay. Hold on, it's a little... Okay, yeah, watch your step. It's a little funky right there. Watch your step over here, too. All right. Aw, man, this place is filthy! Sorry, I thought you said you wanted it like that. No, leave it this way. Actually, you know what? What's gonna be great is we'll bring people in here, and this is where they have to stay over night. You know, they'll be over there. Heck, they can even sleep on the bed. we're just gonna scare the living bejesus out of 'em. Okay, so, I guess, you know, I'm getting a little hot and sticky in here, so I'm gonna take this off, and, uh... Okay. You're not like the character in the movie, are you? How do you mean? You know, like, a womanizer. A player, and stuff. Elena- see, I know your name. Look, trust me, it's just- it's just acting. I promise, baby. I'm nothing like that in real life. I'm a- I'm a big teddy bear. You know, gentle as a puppy dog. - Yeah? - Yeah. So what's in the bag? Hmm, I dunno. and some things Danny wanted for tomorrow night. Oh my God, is this the board from the movie? Yeah, I think so. No, I don't believe them things work at all. They're so creepy. Well, you know, uh, I believe it do work. Let me see this here. Let me find it. All right. Come here. So, you do know how this work, right? Not really. Okay, before we start, you gotta know the rules, remember? Like in the movie? - Exactly. Okay, the first rule is that you cannot ask the spirit how you're going to die. Okay, 'cause it could subconsciously- it could make it happen, and it could be crazy. And I don't want that to happen to you. Okay, rule number two, you never ask the spirit how it died. Oh, oh, right, because it might make them upset because they relive it, or something, right? Yes, and then the board'll freeze up and it won't work anymore. Now, you remember the last one, right? It's the most important one. Never stop playing without saying goodbye. Yeah, okay, so you were paying attention, huh? Okay, cool. So, can we try it? Why not? Yeah, I mean, you could sit next to me and protect me from all the mean spirits, right? Uuh... Well, since you put it that way, let's do it, but hold on. But, you know... ...I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try. Huh? All right, let's put our hands on it. Okay, I'm gonna put this one on it. Now, we gotta touch hands 'cause that's the only way it's gonna work. I don't remember that part. Well, that's 'cause you wasn't in the movie. Okay? Is anybody there? Is anybody there? Is anybody there? Hello? Oh, my God. Well, see? What'd I tell you? It works. Let me ask the first question. Okay. Spirit, do I really like this lovely lady sittin' on the side of me? I mean, like, honestly. I'd be nothing but a perfect boyfriend, right? See, I told you. Now, why would the spirit lie? You're such a bastard. I know. Elena! You're on theater hours. I know. Nothing was going on. I've been trying to close up for a few minutes now. Let's go. Okay, chill out. I'm coming. Hey, hey, hey. Did I get you in trouble? Oh, no, he likes me. Like you? What do you mean? We went out to dinner one time and I guess he's just kind of bitter that it didn't work out. Oh, that's it? Yeah. Wow, well, you know, an insecure boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend, or friend-friend in the picture with me is not a good mix. I mean, look at him, and then look at me. Shut up. Come on, let's go. He's already mad. Perfect. Oh... shit... Oh, it's a bug. Where am I, Lord? What was that? Okay. Oh, hell, no. Oh, hell, no. Did I just do that? I did that. Dang! Hello? I just dropped my keys down the stairs. Can someone get 'em for me? Hello? Hello, no. Dang! Dang it. Okay. Okay, get it together. You can do this. Really, Zinna? Really? Do you have to be the black girl that dies first in the movie? Ain't nobody got time for this. Hey, um, I'm sorry about earlier. I really wasn't doing anything. Well, Elena, just because we're exes... We're not exes. What are you talking about? I mean, I took you out to a nice restaurant, I bought you decent food, you know. I was having a great time, I mean, weren't you? No, I was just being nice. Elena... ...I think I love you. Well, I don't. Hello? Is anyone up there? The theater is closed! The tour begins tomorrow! Ty? Are you here? I'm ready to go. You're not still mad, are you? Ty? Is that you? Somebody help me! Please! I ain't dyin' tonight. I die first in the movie. I mean, can't a brother survive somethin'? Dang, man, you know what I'm sayin'? I want- I want that ghost- I'm not joking, covered in blood, just, aah, rip me open. No, no, you can have that. What'd you do? Y'all both workin' that horror tour this evening, aren't you? Yes, sir. Well, uh... ...y'all better watch yourselves. Officer... ...I don't know what you're talking about. See... I don't appreciate any big city outsiders trying to bring evil into my peaceful little town here. I told you, I don't know what you're talkin' about. I'm telling' you about that movie, this haunted tour thing you've got here tonight. Yeah, it's just that this theater's haunted. Yeah, it's haunted for real. Now, I might not have believed it when I was a little bit younger... but bein' Sheriff in this town for so many years, I've seen some pretty crazy things go down. Inside that theater... ...there was a monster. And that monster killed people. He killed people, he like... ate 'em up and... he spit out all the bones. Look, now this here is just for fun, man. for the kids and promotin' our movie. Nothing else, Officer. Well, I understand all that, but when it comes to Ouija boards, and you don't know what they're capable of really doin'. I read about it. All right? I saw that movie of y'all's last night, and what was it, it was you that said that they could be used as a passageway between the ghost world and ours. Well, it was me, and with all due respect, sir, I mean, It's just a movie. I know it's a movie. I'm not stupid. I know it's fake, and stuff, but it's based on something that's real. Now these boards, they're not to be toyed around with like you're playin' a game of checkers and all. This is serious. And the fact that you're gonna have one in there you're gonna be playin' it, you're gonna be playin' it overnight in that theater, See, I don't- I don't think that's smart. You know, I just think that's a bad mix. You understand what I'm gettin' at? Look, we'll be... super careful, all right, promise. Scouts honor. I'll be watchin' y'all tonight... ...and if anything gets outta hand, and I mean anything, especially after this meeting we just had, y'all gonna have me to deal with. Thanks, Sheriff. Yes, sir, master. Have a good day, sir. Crazy. That was- no, that was weird. That's what that was. He just wanted to win a pissing contest. I just say we just make him think he won. Whatever works, man. What time is it? It's 10:15. It's locked. We were supposed to meet, uh... that manager from yesterday. What was his name? - I don't know, man. Come on. Playin' around, man. Let us in. You guys like this? Hey, I made you one. - Oh, yeah. - You see the resemblance? And, now here's the thing, yours can be this or... this one right here. Look at... Oh, smile for me, smile. Ah, look, cheese! - That one. Yeah I like that one. Better teeth. You know, I'm sensitive about my teeth. Hey, oh, what was all that about? It was about some cop out there askin' us about tonight. He was being superstitious about something. That's not all he is. Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean? Okay, rumor has it, he, like, he, like, dated, like, his sister, dog, or like, cousin. One of those things. Sibling of some kind. Oh, I feel safer already. That's disgusting. Welcome to small town America. What's the population, anyway? Everybody's related. No, there's about two or three of us that aren't related. - That's cool. - That is nice. Have you seen Ty? No, but, uh, have you seen Susie? Who the hell is Susie? - The girl I was on yesterday. - Elena. Oh, no, Elena was supposed to open the door for me today, and luckily I had the key, you know. So, yeah. - Let's go find her. Dude, they'll show up later. Yeah, she ain't tryin' to find you. You guys wanna- you guys wanna set up? Absolutely not. Hey, where's craft services? I'll find it. It's probably down here, right? Don't worry, I'll help you tomorrow. - But it's today. - I'm just playin'. Hey, where's the girls' dressing room? Oh, the little girls' room is this way. J, J. - Yo! - What's up? - Just chillin'. I got some ladies in the car, about to go get some drinks, man. You wanna roll? - Absolutely. Where we goin'? Some town about, what, 15 miles from here? 15 miles? You wanna go or what? Oh, that's Hollis Oklahoma. Let me fix this. Why you gonna go so far? It's a dry county, man. Like, they're in a drought? - No alcohol. - None? None. I was thinking about getting a bottle of everything. Hey, I can come with. Hey, I can stay behind. That means he's not coming? No, I'm gonna hang out. Just text me when you get back. Okay, yeah, it'll just be one on one time. Together. Okay. - No. Just go, man. - I'm gonna be out in the car. J, I'll get you. See you. Oh, oh, oh, yeah, I made you this mask, it's, oh, scary. Ouija Ouikend. It's not that ghetto. Oh, sweet, video glasses. These are really cool. Are they, like 3D glasses, or...? Don't put 'em back on. These are Danny's. You got me. Danny! It's not even gonna be scary. Yeah, it's gonna be totally lame. Whatever, you're gonna be screaming and hanging onto my shirt before we even get inside. Hi. Whatever. So, I won the thing last night. I'm Michelle. I think there might be tickets. Yeah, sure, thanks. We should have brought Ignacio. Figure. Leave Margo alone. Oh, awesome, thank you. Don't forget the movie! It's better than Paranormal Activity! Don't forget The Ouija Experiment before you leave! That works so well. They're loving it. That's cool, but, how am I supposed to sell the movie if they're running' past me at 100 miles per hour? Oh, uh, okay, here's what we'll do. I'm not gonna scare 'em as bad so, it'll be a slow ghost so they walk by. Oh, great, because I do not wanna be stuck with all these movies at the end of the night. Speaking of slow ghosts, where's Justin? I don't know, I thought he was being a ghost already. No, no I placed everybody everywhere. Uh, he hasn't shown up. I'm so sorry, I mean, that's not like him. I'll text him. - Okay. And, um, have you seen Eric? What?! Yeah, he hasn't shown up either. Big surprise. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Okay, ready to go for round two. Okay. I played Calvin, remember? Yeah, I was that guy. You mean the player guy? The one that makes girls buy him things? Look, come on, now, see, I'm nothing like that. It's just acting. Eric! Eric, get over here! Look, so if you just let me... Eric, get over here! Look, I'm gonna be right back, ladies, all right? What? - Where have you been? I've been over there minglin' with those sexy ladies. - Mingling, huh? - Yeah. then why aren't you in there vein' a ghost like you're supposed to be? Oh, I'm up already? I didn't realize they needed me yet. You need to calm down, 'cause I'm pretty sure Justin got it covered. No, he is not in there... either. Am I the only person here concerned about the level of professionalism that is expected of us? Look, I am professional. No... you're not! Okay, but what you are is working at the lowest level of the oldest profession. Uh, she means you're a prostitute. Well, at least I'm getting paid. Get... in there. Bye, ladies. She thinks she's my mama. It was the wiggle when she walks. The tour is now over. The overnight tour is about to begin for only the winners of last night's contest. You don't have to go home but you can't stay here. Have a great night. Um... Danny? Is this the backstage area place you were telling me to go? Let's see. "Zinna Death Scene. " "Zinna greets guests then exits to backstage for her death scene. " Yeah, just read. Um... What? "Danny leads guests into another haunted room. " Okay. Hmm. Let's see. "Zinna grabs fake blood and pours it on her. Guests should arrive in five minutes. Zinna must hurry to make the death look real. " Fake blood, fake blood. If I were fake blood... ...where would I be? If I was Danny, crazy person, placin' the fake blood, where would I put it? I don't know where this blood is. I'm gonna have to ask Danny. I'm never bona find it down here. This place is creepy. Oh! No, it's just me, Danny. Oh, my God. - Worked pretty good, huh? - Yeah. Shh. They're on their way, okay. They're in the next room. You take the blood, and okay, after this scene, we're gonna head up to the balcony and get your audio on my recorder. Okay, got it. How do I put it on? What do you mean? Just put it all over your body. Especially get some in the mouth. Ew, really? Don't worry, it tastes- it tastes really good. It does? Yeah, it's just a mixture of Karo syrup, food coloring and some chocolate. It looks kind of chunky. That's just the strawberry I put in it. Mmm, it does taste pretty good. Okay. You hurry up. I got this. Okay. All right. This is my favorite room. But, be careful when walking into this one. Because this... Many have died walking on this very floor. Anyone know how? Well, let me tell you. Come on in, all the way in. Get right around this area. Wait. Good. Did you know that when messing with a Ouija board if you forget to say... goodbye... ...hi... ...then what happens is the spirit is let loose. Yes, loose just to go all around. And what that does is it... no smiling... it allows a portal to be opened up into our world. And that... ...is when the spirit, they can grow stronger... ...and stronger... ...to where they are no longer a spirit... ...but something much more... ...like an evil... ...being. It's not moving little things. No. It's moving much more. Did you hear that? It's getting angry. Quickly, we must outrun it! To the basement! You're not moving! To the basement! ...is the only one who's been scared. Why do you keep calling me that? You guys, this is going to be so lame. Stop being a nob. Maybe it gets better. You know what? At least it's free. Okay, yeah, thanks. Something's wrong. Oh no! The ghost has killed Zinna! Quickly, let's run! The ghost is here! Yeah, that's kid of impressive. Come! It was a ghost! Whoo! No. Oh, for God's sake. Be afraid. Yeah. Right this way. All right, now this is a special room. Now, this was actually the first time anyone ever died of gonorrhea. That was a good one. It's just me. You guys recognize him? It's the C to the A, to the L... No, Danny. No. This is Calvin from The Ouija Experiment. Eric. Come on, give him a round of applause. He did good. Well, hello again, Miss British Accent. Hello, Eric. You gonna behave yourself this time? Danny, would you tell her I'm a teddy bear? Not just a teddy bear, he's a grizzly bear! Ah, that's cold, man. That's cold. I'm sorry, I shouldn't be touching you. No, you shouldn't. All right, set down your stuff. You know, we're actually going to stay here tonight. Here? Really? This place? - Yes. - Gross. - Yeah. I thought it was pretty nice, though. Hey, is that a Ouija board? Oh, actually, it's not supposed to be here. Oh, yeah, no one here set it up for you. I have brought an EVP recorder. Electronic Voice Phenomenon. What it does, is it records frequencies and sounds that you do not hear by the human ear. This is a mini cassette recorder. Whats a cassette? Really? you're gonna do this? I said it ironically. Uh, normally it records sounds that you're not supposed to hear, but for some reason you can hear it when you play it back. I don't really get that. Wait, so, is this the Ouija board from the movie? Yes, it is. So, can we play it? Guys, I don't think we should play with this. I have a really bad feeling. I felt it yesterday too. So you are scared. No, it's not that. It's something else. I'm getting a really weird vibe. Especially from this room. As you should, because this room is a paranormal hot spot. If you really wanna know what's going on, let's go to the source. So, you wanna summon a spirit, and record its voice? Exactly. Okay, gather around everybody. Okay, I'm sitting next to you. You know, for protection. Okay, so maybe I need protection from a few things in this room. It's full of thrills. You know, I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try. Oh... Really? Michael Jackson, "Thriller?" That's all you got? - Damn. You're too smart for your own good, girl. But a large intellectual capacity isn't greater than wisdom. Say, what? Alanis Morissette. I can quote music too. Ah ha. That hurt. That hurt. Smart and sexy. I like that. - You guys wanna begin? - All right. - Put your hands over here. It's good if we overlap. Hey, man. I'm sorry, it's just... Just thought I'd help a little bit. Ready? Is anybody there? Is anybody there? Is anybody there? Is anybody there? B. L. C. N. Y. Is that where you are? The balcony? Yes. You're in the balcony. You guys wanna go? Really? Yeah, let's check this out. Come on, let's go. You guys ready? Okay. Michelle - Yeah? I don't have a good feeling about this. It's just all the spirit energy flying around in the air. Don't worry. Come on, let it go. Just have fun. Come on. I didn't give this free ticket to Debbie Downer. I gave it to Margo. I don't know. You wanna fit in more, right? Yeah, well, you gotta get out of your comfort zone. Come on. It's gonna be fun. You gotta open up. Okay. Ready? Come on. Let's go. Come upon the spooky balcony. I am going to do an EVP session. Don't mind the spooky lights. But let us... ...begin. All right? The spirit that haunts this establishment... ...are you here? Can you prove your existence? Yeah, show yourself! Stop, that's not funny. Where are you? Where's Eric? I dunno. Michelle? I don't know where he is. He was with us before. This is just part of the haunted house, right? Let's go find him. Come on. Can't we turn the light on? We can in the control room. Uh, it's all set to automatic right now. But we can do it manually. But, uh, yeah this is all part of the show. So this is just all a part of the show? Okay, um, stay close to me. Eric? Eric, you okay? That thing isn't even doing anything. It says danger and caution. Don't worry, we're safe. Eric! Eric, you okay? We need to get out of here. We gotta call the police. It's downstairs in the basement in my pack. Shit, I'm not getting any reception. I've got a bar. 911? Hello? We're at the Ritz theater. We need some help. Shit. Okay, we need to open the door. We've gotta open the door. If we open it for a second maybe we'll get some reception. No, we can't. We can't be those girls in horror movies that do stupid things. We have to do smart people things. Would a smart person stay in here? Smart people would call the poise. Yeah, we need to open the door. If you hold it from the other side then maybe it'll stop that jangle thing. It won't seeing open. - Okay. Slowly. I've got two bars. Okay. Okay. 911, what is your emergency? Hi, I'm at the Ritz Theater in Wellington, TX, and I'm on the horror tour... No, actually, I heard gunshots. That means you have to come, right? Did you say you're at the horror tour? Shit. Yes, I did. But there are actually people dying. There's a creature and it's trying to attack us. Is this some kind of joke? No, this is not a joke. We're really in danger. Please, you have to send someone. There's something out there. It's hunting us down. It's trying to kill us. Look, ma'am, making prank calls isn't funny. You costs taxpayers lots of money especially if they're based on ghosts and creatures. Please. Please, I'm telling you. There are dead bodies here. You have to send someone. Blame it all on me. My name is Michelle Joy. I'm at the Ritz Theater in Wellington. Please, you have to send someone. You have to help us. Okay, I'll send someone. This better be for real. We have this call recorded. Just send someone, you bitch. This is fucking nuts! Come on! Where are you?! I'm over here! Oh, my God, it's light. Where is it? - How do we get out of here?! Who gives a shit where it is?! Oh, my God, are you okay? Margo! Margo, what's the matter? There's a woman... She cap- she captured the thing and... ...she has it chained up. Margo, it doesn't matter, we've gotta go! Margo, come on! I'm so glad you're here. There's a thing inside trying to kill us. She's not a thing. - Oh. Shit! Get inside! Y'all know where the downstairs basement is? You gotta take the old hallway this way. Let's move. Well, move it! Walk down these stairs right here. I told y'all not to be messin' with those boards. They're real and they can bring back evil. They can, and now you got your proof down here, don't you? You kids are so headstrong. You just think you're so smart. But none of you listened. We didn't do it. It was them. We didn't even touch it. Y'all had something to do with it. You both had something to do with it. You were all part of this ghost and spirit weekend. No. Now, y'all just gonna be rude? Or are you gonna say hello to my baby girl? Let me ask y'all somethin'. Do you know how hard it was for me to let her go the first time? I tell ya... ...it was hell. See, I didn't even want her in the first place. She was a curse from God. See, God cursed me and my wife for lovin' each other. He didn't take it well, you know, kindred folk procreatin'. So He doomed my wife to die giving birth to that girl right there. And if that wasn't bad enough... ...He cursed me again in an unimaginable way. He brought forth to me a foul, vile creature-child. And then he made me feel for it. And even though I tried... ...my heart can't just seem to- to hate or push away somethin' that's a part of it. After all those years... ...I finally- I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't live with the fact that I had my daughter locked downstairs in a basement. It was sheltered from the whole damn world. I was ashamed of her. She's a freak. She was a creature. She wasn't from this earth. She did not belong here. And one day... ...I walked in... ...and I put this very gun to her forehead... ...but I couldn't pull the trigger. I tried but I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it! I didn't I didn't know what else to do. I didn't know what else to do so I stopped feedin' her. I stopped givin' her water. It was like three weeks later... ...I walked in... ...and she was just layin' there... ...still. I reached down to feel for a pulse... That was when I knew she was dead. And the strange thing is, I was relieved, right? I was relieved because... ...I didn't feel like a murderer anymore. I felt this big weight off my back. You know, the curse had finally been lifted. That might sound... awful and cruel. But what would you have done? Huh?! What would you have done? Don't judge me! Yeah, I did unspeakable things. I did. But here you both are right now lookin' at me like I'm crazy! You're the ones that brought her back... ...using that board. I'll tell you right now... ...I can't do it all over again, no. See... ...God has given me a second chance. This is my shot at redemption. I'm gonna take good care of her this time. I'm gonna take good care of her this time. I know that look. I know that look all too well. I always hated that look. I hate it! Do either of you wanna tell me what you think that look means? It means only one thing. It means that she's ready to eat. Please... please, no. No, not you? Either way... ...there's gonna be a lot of bones for me to get rid of. She likes the smell of blood. It makes her hungry. Let her go. Margo, get the gun. Margo, get the gun. We're not just pretty girls in horror movies... ...we make smart choices. Kill it. I don't know if I can. - Do it! Pull the trigger! Let me have that. I'm sorry, I couldn't- I couldn't do it. I felt her... I felt it hurting. The thing... ...I felt it's pain. It doesn't matter what that thing looked like, that thing was human. Human or not, it didn't belong here. There are some things in this world that...
