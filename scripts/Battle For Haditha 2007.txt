And basically, the only thing I'm fighting for that I know that I'm fighting for is to make it home each and every day without getting killed. Because I don't know why we're here. Oh I know why we're here but I don't know-- Yeah, I don't know why we're here. I mean, I've seen a... I'd say about all dressed in black, in a burqa, or whatever they call them dresses. pull out an AK from under her skirt and starts spraying. Needless to say, she got-- I mean, she became a combattant, and that's the truth, you know. Like...men, women, child, if they pick up a gun and start shooting at you they are considered combattants and that's reality. It's also just like hunting. I've hunted deer and coyotes and shit. It's like a person thinks the same, tries to think like another person would. with a weapon. So, it's luck. It's the ultimate style of hunting, is war. Like, this is the planet Earth. The body, right? Body is planet Earth. and Iraq...is the cornhole, the brown hole, the asshole, whatever you wanna call it. with a bunch of dingleberries. Insurgents. A bunch of dingleberries hanging around, just waiting for a shit storm. And we just happen to be the fucking turds... going through the asshole. And all the dingleberries are just surrounding us, trying to kill us. That's what I think about Iraq. Just a giant butthole. Hey Jack! Fuck ya! I love that shit! Look at my fucking ass! Hey! This is why I fucking love the Marine Corps. All right, let's move! Hey Corporal Marquez. Take a fire team across the street. Yeah. Look look look. Hey! What the fuck dawg! I've never seen a dick that small. Hurry up, put your little dick away. Let's go! - You hear that? - Aye Corporal. His dick is so small, he's peeing on his nuts. - Hurry up, get back in formation. - OohRah. - Ey Cuthbert. - Yes, corporal. - You ready to get some? - Hua. Found 119 IEDs, (Improvised explosive device) and these faggots are playing at the side of the road. All the insurgents came from Falludja. They are all here, waiting for us. - You know that, right? - Yes corporal. We're just life bait And you retards stop fucking around. Chickens? Democracy will succeed because every month, more and more Iraqis are fighting for their own country. People we have liberated will not surrender their freedom. Democracy will succeed because the USA will not be intimidated by a bunch of thugs! ? ? ? war. ...corner of Chestnut... (unintelligible chatter on radio) - You got DVDs? - Yeah, sure I got. You want? Yeah. Are these the only DVDs you have? Let me imagine what you're looking for. You're looking for... - Boom boom? - Boom Boom! - That's what I'm talking about. - Yeah. All right.

No man. I mean, it's the murder capital. Who the fuck wants to live there? Let me guess. You wass in a gang. No, actually, Philadelphia doesn't even have gangs, dude. So you left the murder capital of the US to come to Falludja the head of the murder capitals of the world. - These are in one war zone...

Please give his family the strength to move on with their lives. We know he is in a better place with you, Lord. Please give the United States Marine corps the courage and ability to destroy our enemy, who hides like cowards among civilians. We thank you Lord. We have to make some pretty difficult decisions sometimes out here. But we know you understand. Thank you, and OoRah. All right. OoRah Marines. - OoRah! - Outstanding job. - Corporal Ramirez. - Sir. You handled yourself like a true professional out there.

Thank you sir. - All right. Job well done, Marine. - Thank you, sir. -All of you, great job. - OoRah, sir. OoRah! - Good job, Ramirez. - Fucking sergeant. - Ey man. - Wat's up?

Like, last nightmare, I kept hearing like cries and shit, like, I keep seeing these fucking bodies, man. These fucking women laid out fucking dead. Their kids. It's not so much the guys, man. it's more like the women. And then I see pictures of like my fucking mother, laying next to them and, like I just wish I could fucking change a lot of shit, man. What are you talking about? I feel like a lot of those fucking people I killed are fucking persons. and you know me. That I'm fucking living with this guilt for the rest of my life, man. No, I fucking don't understand that either, man. I feel like I'm personally responsible for all those motherfuckers that died underneath me. Every Marine that died under-- underneath me. I feel like I'm personally responsible, like I could've fucking changed this, do you know what I mean? I fucking hate the motherfuckers, the officers that sent us in. Fucking hate 'em! Ramirez, you all right? Fucking hate 'em, man! Everyone of them! I fucking give a fuck about the fucking medals, man! They don't give a fuck about us. They're going subway ? ? ? ? It's the boss. Do not engage the boss. Roger. Squib. Nobody is the ? ? ? Direct Tango, direct Tango. - ? ? ? building is to the boss. - Roger that. Major General, sir. We ran a check on all the Iraqi dead and none matches with insurgents database. Nothing that you say causes me any undue concern... It's a cleanly coordinated attack and standard operating procedures were followed. This is the official press release A U.S. Marine and 15 Iraqi civilians were killed yesterday from the blast of a... roadside bomb in Haditha. Iraqi Army soldiers and Marines returned fire killing eight insurgents and wounding another. The case first came to light when a time magazin reporter received video footage, shot by a local Iraqi journalism student. It showed the gruesome aftermath of the incident. It also has interviews with some of the survivors, Safa Junis, 12 years old, is the only living survivor from her family of 9. She claims that the Marines came into her house and shot her entire family. Hiba Abdoolah and three children were the only survivors of a family of twelve. If it had not been for the Time Magazine report, this case would never have come to light. The Marine high command failed to investigate the events of November 19th for over two months. A blame, they say, must not be allowed to stay at the enlisted level but should be traced to its source, which is the Secretary of Defense and the Commander in Chief. I am troubled by the initial news stories, um... I'm, uh, mindful that there is a thorough investigation going on. If in fact the, uh... you know... laws were broken, there'll be punishment. One of the charged Marines, a Corporal Ramirez, according to his attourney was nominated for a Bronze Star for his heroism on the very day that incident took place. The Marines claim that they were merely following their standard operating procedures, lost ? ? ? in extremely hostile environment... Sir. Corporal Ramirez ? ? ? ? , sir. At ease. CPL Ramirez. You're being investigated for CPL Delacruz, Five counts of murder. CPL Matthews, three counts of murder. and Sgt. Ross. three counts of murder. Now it is my job and your job as Marines to protect the reputation, the honor and the future of this corps, and I will not have a band of reckless Marines ruin that future and that reputation... Holy shit. Ey Matthews, check that fire out. Ramirez! Ramirez. You ok? We've all seen a lot of action at a young age. I'm 20 years old, and this is my third tour of duty. We've all seen things that will haunt us for the rest of our lives. And I guess after a while you just get hardened. You become numb. # We're on a mission to never forget # 3,000 people that I've never met # We want some answers and all that we get # Some kind of shit about a terrorist threat # Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies # Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies # Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies # Surpise surprise # Lies # Lies # We're on a mission to dig up the truth # You think we're stupid and there's no proof # Well let me tell you that the time has come # To pull the trigger on the smoking gun # Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies # Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies # Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies Lies # Surpise surprise # Lies # Lies # Lies # Lies # Don't listen to me listen to your head # Don't listen # Don't listen to anything they've said # Don't listen # Lies # Lies # Lies # Lies # America has been hijacked # Not by Al Qaeda, not by Bin Laden # But by a group of tyrants # That should be of great concern to all Americans
