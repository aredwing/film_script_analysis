Director: Shibata Issei Within these last few days, those with the surname "Satou" have died nationwide. The deceased did not share anything else in common except for the surname, and they all died from... ...various causes, such as suicide, etc. It's become a big mystery. What does this mean? Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Are you all right? Stand up. You're such a pain. Hiroshi, why are you dressed like that? Just like a low-level yakuza, huh? I'm not a little kid anymore. You can call me a kid, but I don't intend on becoming a yakuza. This is my domain. I won't let you make trouble here. I don't want to be under your control. Then you'd better listen to me! Makoto Gouji Run! Hey. Go that way. Let's split up. What? I won't let anyone catch me. Riaru Onigokko aka The Real Monster Game aka The Chasing World Are you all right? You didn't get caught. Tsubasa, you're so fast. Of course he is, he's always been a master fugitive! That guy is a troublemaker. They're just trying to collect some debts. One day, you're gonna get killed. You've always been good friends, ever since we were young. Now we're no longer friends. Both you and Hiroshi share the same last surname - "Satou". What a good name. Don't say it again. Yeah, it seems like "Satou's" are dying off everywhere. I've heard about that. They just suddenly faint. Tsubasa, are you okay? This is the most popular surname in Japan. Surely most of them have died. Almost all of the "Satou's" have died. Do you want to kill me? Okay. Stop, he's hurt! Hey, wait up. Dad, you're gonna get sick. Oh, Tsubasa Oh, it's the alcohol. This is for you. I don't want that. Gotcha! Go to sleep. Ai. I've come to take your temperature. Someone already take your temperature? Okay, it's normal. How are you? Ai, what was our mom like? If mom was still alive, dad would surely stop drinking. As for you, maybe you wouldn't be like this. Oh God! Damn! You brought so many people just for me. You won't escape this time! Hiroshi, that's enough for you! I want you to disappear. Get lost. What? Where'd they go? Hey guys! Hiroshi found me. He's dangerous. Who's that? Who're you? Don't screw around. Why were you holding hands? Are you mistaking us for someone else? Are you Suzuki Makoto and Takahashi Gou? That's right. How do you know us? I'm Satou Tsubasa. Your surname's "Satou". Satou? Let's go. Hang on. We don't associate ourselves with anyone playing The Monster Game. Monster Game? Run. Why? He's crazy. Really, poor thing. What's the matter? Shit! Hey, hey. Stop. Where's the monster? Where's the monster? Where is it? Are you Hiroshi? Who are you? I'm Satou Tsubasa. Have we met before? You better be careful. There's a monster. Let me ask you, what's The Monster Game. - What're you talking about? - I didn't know so I'm asking you. You're Satou, right? Everyone keeps talking about "Satou". What happens to the "Satou's"? Are you serious? Why would I be joking with you? You don't know about The Real Monster Game? "Satou's" are being hunted nationwide. Once caught, they'll be killed. What kind of game is that? Don't you know? Where have you been? I'm right here. The Monster Game has been going on this week. Its an Imperial order. Imperial? Imperial what? - What's "Imperial"? - That's Nippon Mikado. You don't even know about the Imperial. They got caught. Many "Satou's" have gradually disppeared in the last 4 days. A Monster? That's the Monster? Idiot, get over here! Please, save me! Let me go, I don't want to die. I don't want to die, I don't want to die. What are you doing? Let's go! What's happening? That thing just now. That's an iron wire knife. If you're caught, you're killed upon arrest. Those who run away... They're caught and sent to the gas room. They're hunting those with the surname of "Satou". - Yes. - Just "Satou's"? - Yes. - Why? The Imperial won't allow too many people of the same surname. That's illogical. Can't use cell phones; there's no signals. Be quiet. Hey, hey. I said "be quiet". The Monster Game ends on the 5th day. Calling all monsters - please go back to the nearest Game Centre. The 5th day End of The Monster Game. So dangerous. We're lucky it ended before we were killed. If one doesn't follow the rules of the game, they can be killed anytime. The "Monsters" are chosen from a lot of criminals. Depending on the amount of "Satou's" being arrested... ...they'll decide whether to issue a penalty or a release. Nothing happened today. Besides The Monster Game, everything is normal. Attend school, play outside. How do they know that who's a "Satou"? The Monsters use GPS to track us. How did they know that we were "Satou's"? ID. ID? I won't carry any now. That won't help. It's already been filed with the Imperial. At birth, our ID has been entered into the database. Unbelievable! What's this? Impossible, what happened? Dad. Damn! What's going on? My house and sister are both gone. What about The Monster Game's Imperial. Who is it? No one knows the real face of the Imperial. He's only known as "Satou". Live telecast of a report from the Imperial now. Your Highness, please watch over us today! Here is someone who broke the rules of The Game... ...and will be punished for the first time today. He used a car to run away. Save me! Like this! Attention: those who use transportation or weapons to break the rules will get a severe or painful punishment! Let's review the results today. Your Highness, how is it so far? That's the "Satou's" distribution map before The Monster Game started. After The Monster Game began, the 1st and 2nd day ended. That's the 5th day. The amount of Monsters have gradually increased. It'd be much more difficult to escape from this point onward. But to the one who survives on behalf of the fallen, fulfill your wishes and work harder. That's a report from the Imperial, thank you. - Good work. - Good night. - You did well tonight. - You did well, too. It's always a live telecast. - Kaori, watch what you say. - You've warned me before. And asking us to take the photo of that idiot's face. Don't do that again, don't ever make the Imperial angry. He's not human. Yes. The ratings are good. The dictatorship of the Imperial has been going on for 18 years. The citizens have never seen his real face before. I've told you before that you'd be the one to screw it up. Just kidding. If we go against the Imperial, it means taking the road to doom. Am I mischievous? The Hiroshi I know is the brother of a Yakuza. So, you're another Hiroshi. I don't know what's going on... Makoto and Gouji are now gay. They look the same. It seems to be the same, but there's a big difference. We've played together since we were kids, remember? But those guys are bad. They even beat their parents to death. Hiroshi suddenly changed. When did that happen? It was during elementary school. I already said that we're opposites. I blame this game for my blurry memory. I don't think it matters. As far as I know, there's no Imperial in my Japan. Not even any Monster Game. If this happened, it's all right for the masses to rebel. Why should I listen to him? I've heard that the Imperial has supernatural powers. The traitors are killed. This is not an anime. The masses have discussed this. Actually the... ...rebel forces have been shut down. Though I don't know of any other ways out. I keep thinking that there'd be other ways. You're so different. Who're you? - Brother. - What? Are you Satou Tsubasa? You Ai. Are you Ai? I finally found you. The sister that you said was hospitalized. It's impossible. Follow me. Hurry up. I've no time to explain. Hang on, are you really Ai? Impossible. Ai wouldn't call me "brother". She's unemotional and can't talk. Because of the relation, that's why I call you "brother". I've never seen you until now. Look. But you're my brother. What're you saying. Because my substitute is a brother. Substitute? You're from the world of parallel. The parallel world? Though it seems the same, it exist in two different worlds. What's that? Just follow me. How about you? I'll go with you. Nothing to do if I go to school. Your name is also "Satou". Hiroshi. Satou Hiroshi. Glad to meet you. Your sister has come to this side of the world. What? She could talk to me. She told me that she lived near this area, but I searched through it yesterday. She wasn't in the hospital? I know. She was born with a power. So, she confined herself to her own world. Dad, I've got them here. Brother, that's Satou Hiroshi. Dad. Boy, if you call me "dad" again, I'll kill you. As you can see, dad's leg was wounded and he can't run. That's why I hope that you can help. Who asked for his help? Wait, can you both listen to me. That's a good place here. I don't understand. Someone please explain it to me. When'd your mom die? Twenty years ago, she came to this world. It's not a question of time, only a problem of parallel. The parallel world is when 2 worlds are moving forward concurrently. There would be a "substitute" that inter-relates to one another. The birth and death would be at coincidence. Our mom's substitute would be Satou Masumi. But your mom is special... she had the special power to cross over to the parallel world. That's why you were born in this world. It was you who discarded yourself from this world. In the real world, Satou Masumi was non-existent, but she gave birth to you. So Satou Hiroshi would have to survive alone. And link with your newborn self... She went back to her own world again once she gave birth to you and your sister in two separate worlds. That's why mom died after giving birth to me. Concurrently, your mom was also dead. How could this be possible? In short, your birth in this world and your ID number have not been updated. The cause of Mom's death was accidental? I don't have to tell you. Masumi is my wife. Even if she's your mom, that's useless. Dad. I'm sorry. Dad doesn't believe in the parallel world. No matter what, you would recall Ai back to normal. If we die on this side of world your dad and sister will also die in the real world. Although I know you're confused, please listen to me. Your special power is being able to cross over into this world Due to her first time experience Ai. Many "Satou's" are being killed lately. - How are you? - This strange phenomena is a big concern. Investigation done by the police was all in vain until now. The search has come to a dead end now. Pictured are the "Satou's" killed yesterday. Satou Minoru, Satou Masaru, Satou Yui, Satou Sachiko... Monster Game. The 6th day begins. The Monster Game for the 6th day begins. Calling all "Satou's", be highly inspired to escape from the monsters. Look. The once busy streets are now empty. Since the beginning of The Monster Game there were reports of outsiders being hurt. Now the school and almost all companies have been closed. A "Satou" has been caught! Let me go! What's that? Go away! Don't interfere! Damn. How should I face this kind of sin? If the "real" Hiroshi could cross over to this world... ...would the people be free from this disaster? It doesn't matter. Tsubasa was all alone... and the others still got the same substitutes. It's not supposed to be him. What should we do? Hush! We've been discovered. Okay, follow me. Run! Here. It's coming. Dad. Is your leg okay? Where's the monster? He didn't catch up with us. Where's Tsubasa? He should be okay. He could be late on purpose. Tsubasa might've done that to protect Dad, who can't run very quickly. Was he caught? Thank goodness, he's okay. Run! He brought the monsters. Run! Ai. What're we playing today? Kissing. Kiss, yes. Ai, I brought the dim-sum for you. What're you doing? Are you all right, Ai? You bastard! You're a doctor. What're you doing?! - What, what am I doing?! - What're you doing then?! Shit. Jump! - No, no. - What're you doing? I'm scared of heights. Idiot! Get ahold of yourself! Go with him! I'm giving Ai to you. Dad. Let's go. You're not going anywhere. You bastard! Bastard. The 6th day, end of The Monster Game. Dad. Dad. No, no. Let's go. No, no. Dad. Dad, no. The 6th day, end of The Monster Game. He's not my dad. Ai has a father and you're a totally different guy as well! Don't be angry. She lost her dad. In the real world, dad is a crippled man. Nobody else would like to believe those words. What're you saying? You're a hypocrite. The "bad" Hiroshi is so much better. What're you saying? You don't understand. Because you're born in a different world, of course you grew up differently. But the essence won't be changed. Your dad died today. Liar! My dad told me this. Mom and myself could use a substitute to speak out. I also told this to your sister. I said that if I died, "You would die in the real world, I'm sorry. " Then she... She said that if she couldn't go herself, she'd ask Tsubasa to save me. You're bluffing. You're now talking to Ai? I could only speak to her through the special power. Unless the person on the other side wants to talk, there is no connection. Look. This is too unbelievable. That may be true, Tsubasa. You said my parents died when I was in elementary school. It's true that they died when I was in elementary. I know. I'm tired of this. I'll do as I please. Who'll take care of her? I'll protect her, I'm a master fugitive. I could go anywhere if I'm alone. The families who raised us were caught just to save us. Even without parents, don't ever give up in helping others. Don't exaggerate. I would end all human beings. I'm always cute. That's enough! That kind of person doesn't become my brother. I'll protect you. I'll protect you. Both your parents died. They were killed as rebels against the Imperial. I have no relatives. - I appreciate your efforts. - Yes. This tip is for you. The Monster Game Finals, the Last Day of The Monster Game. This is the last day. Ken. Wait, that guy. Excuse me! Your friends were all caught yesterday. We pray for your safety. How are you feeling now? How is that interesting? Would these kind of questions mean anything to you? That's what I mean. Sounds pathetic. Do you really pray for our safety? You didn't pray at all. That's none of your business. Don't pretend to care. Wait a minute, I'm not the one to blame. We have work to do as well. Frankly speaking you're working for the sake of viewer ratings. Sure, so what's wrong then? That's right, do whatever you want. We'd better mind our own business. But I think otherwise. That kind of person doesn't become my brother. Think about it. That's the first time I had heard Ai's voice since birth. In the real world she's still in the hospital. Give me one good reason to justify the deaths of those people yesterday. You used to. I beg of you. The last Monster Game. The Final Day of Monster Game begins. Calling all "Satou's": be highly inspired to escape from the monsters. Terrible. Tsubasa's all right. That kind of person Frankly speaking I'm quite happy because I have a brother. Because it's always just been Dad and myself. The Monster Game ends today. Tsubasa could be alive. All right. Don't touch me! Damn. Got it. That staircase. Bastard. Almost captured them all. There's only a few left. Hmm. It's only a matter of time. When I give you the signal, get out of here. What are you talking about? My leg's hurt. I can draw them away. We'll go together. Well done. On the rooftop. Brother. What are you doing? Run! Brother? Tsubasa. You for me. Surely, I thought that the cutest one would make it to the end. I'm regretting this. Let go. - Don't be stupid. - Don't let go. I'm too much trouble. Shut up! It was great to meet you... Hiroshi! I... Stop it. You're too young. I'm not a little kid anymore. You won't escape this time. It's not right if we don't help each other. I keep thinking that there'd be ways out. Why'd you let him go? Why? Why why why? Ai. The Monster Game Let her go, the siren's ringing. It hurts. Calling all "Satou's" to get back to the nearest Game Center. You rascal! Maybe you understand what I mean. To the "Satou's" that survived, go to the administration office and register. I'm sorry, brother. I couldn't help your dad and sister. I'm sorry! I'll save you! Please wait for me! Bastards! Final Day of The Monster Game ends. How's the delayed telecast of the Imperial? It needs more time to be prepared. You know, the monsters were given special orders. All young "Satou's" would be taken alive. What do you think? Who knows. What do you think of this headline? "Just in - The Imperial prefers gentlemen. " You'd better stop that kind of talk. Just kidding. Hey, you're- I know you from somewhere... Don't try anything. Otherwise I'll cut her head off. - What do you want? - How many "Satou's" have been captured? All of them. But in the original world, nobody died. If that's the case, then they would all die together. Only those that have been captured and killed by that time. What did you say? That means those captives were still alive, yes? I don't know. This type of information can't be disclosed. Everybody is now going through ID confirmation. Once everything's done, they would be punished together. Where? Why are you asking this? I want to save my sister... ...before she's killed. There are many places with such facilities within the city. I think you should give up. Is it that difficult to find? The place is under strict control. You can't get inside. Shut up. I researched it thoroughly. Ken. Get the list. I understand how you feel, but you won't be able to save her. It's better if you give up. Bastards. That's enough. Let me go. I'll call the security guard. No need. Get out of here. Hurry. Before they find you. You need to get ready for the telecast. Telecast? It's too early. It won't be broadcast. It will be only be the TV crews who want to talk directly to you, your Highness. Talk about it later, there's one fellow still free now. That's the guy, on the TV telecast. What? Who're you? I'm Satou Tsubasa, survivor from The Monster Game. You're Satou Tsubasa. If I'm alive, you'll fulfill my wish. Right? What's your wish? I want you to return my sister. Okay. How'd you know that I'm looking for you? Bring her here. Brother. Ai. Ai, why? You said you're looking for me. Why? It's because I'll tell you when I meet you. It's because you're the Imperial's son. Let me see your face. Turn off the TV, quick! No. It'd be better to follow brother's word. He's back from the parallel world. Quickly remove your mask. You! Just an old man. Yes. Where's the video camera? It's recording. Mankind is scared of the indefinite object. If there's a supernatural power, they won't be. But you possess no such power. Although dad told brother otherwise, Masumi met the Imperial upon arriving in this parallel world. You married Masumi and misused this power. When you had a problem with someone, you used her power to cross over to the other world to kill that very same person and then return here. So, the same person died instantly. You killed your enemy without any evidence pointing to you. The saying goes that with supernatural powers, all traitors die. So you hid your face and became the Imperial of Japan. But when Masumi realized that you were using her for her powers... ...she ran away from you. She brought her two newborn babies... ...and fell back to her real world. And she married her saviour. My father. Yes. A substitute of my dad. Thus in both worlds, myself and a substitute were born. During this period, the Imperial searched for the missing Masumi. The Imperial wanted to finally take his revenge... He discovered Masumi's substitute. If the substitute died, with nowhere to flee in real world, she herself would die. Later, my dad and myself... and brother... ...would be discovered easily. Your dad sealed off all data in the palace. To sabotage me. The ID code would match with anyone whose surname was "Satou". In other words, I had to catch all "Satou's". That's the real Monster Game. The Imperial wanted to own Masumi's power. So, he searched for Satou Tsubasa who inherited his parents' lineage and personality... ...and I caught all of them. Even made threats if you didn't come forward. would you get out. Tsubasa, I know that you'd help me. Brother, don't. Do you understand? Without friends, this girl would die. If he didn't find us, he'd killed all the "Satou's". I... ...as well as your sister, was fully aware. I won't leave Ai behind. Stupid Imperial, you wait for me there. I'd killed you right now. The connection's dead. Catch that kid, in that TV station. Hurry. If you don't heed my words, both of you will be sentenced to death. What he just said... The Imperial's just a normal man without supernatural powers. I want to save Ai. No. You get caught before even reaching the palace. I won't let anyone capture me. Oh no, the monsters have entered the TV station. This way. Are you all right? This is the elevator for supplies, it'll be okay. No, that's not what I mean. If you mean when you threatened me, forget about it. I see. The son of the Imperial... Do you think I'm special? The mass media will become a weapon. That's the transport exit. I know. I hope that you'll be all right. I'm serious. Wait for me, Ai. Wait. Impossible. Tsubasa, isn't that Tsubasa? Tsubasa, what're you doing here? Where's the monster? - Where's the monster? - Monster? Are you dreaming? Where've you been lately? I'm back, back in the original world. This is a dream. What kind of dream was that? Oh God. This isn't like you, Tsubasa. Your dad is dead. My dad Impossible. This isn't a dream. How'd he die? I heard that he died in the hospital. Dad... Why'd I come back, Ai? If this happened, both of you will die. Damn. What'd I do? Rumor is that Hiroshi was killed by the Yakuza. Surely it's Satou's fault. He said Tsubasa might be dead. Hiroshi That's the way out. Yes, think of the way to save Ai. Hiroshi is my friend... And you If you're scared, get out of here. You said he disappeared? GPS couldn't trace. Come. He's a good-for-nothing. Maybe he went to the opposite world? If both worlds are interlinked I can save the parallel Ai by protecting the Ai here. - Ready? - Yes, ready. Ask the staff in the palace to hurry back. Yes. But the video camera was there. Got it. It doesn't matter what you do to me, Tsubasa isn't coming back. So, I'd let you regret. Besides you're finished These TV station crews Is there anyone here? Farewell, goodbye. Get down from there. It'll be treated as a suicide case. On the rooftop again. Get down now! You bastard! Maybe if this jerk dies, the Imperial dies as well. But I don't kill people. But I'll protect you. Then the Ai in the opposite world will be all right. What're you doing? Stop broadcasting. What's wrong? Your hypocrite mask fell off. You're not supernatural anymore. We won't listen to you again. Brother saved me. I blame you. Ai, let go. Let's make a sacrifice together, Dad. What'd you say? Ai, say "hi" to the other Ai for me. Stop it! Mom Kaori. Switch to live telecast. That's it, the end of the Imperial. Yes. What saved me? Where is this place? Are you Tsubasa? I heard that from the opposite world Ai. This person is all right. Untie him. Yes. Where is this place? It's Japan. Here we call it Japan. Due to the environmental destruction, the discrimination of class and slavery... we are the liberation army. I heard about this before. The parallel world is boundless. Wait, what's wrong this time... This is a rebellion. I don't want any part of it, no joke! Fight with us. Ai, come here. We caught a spy in the old streets. He'd be alive then. Take me to this person. He's our friend now. Follow me. We want to go to the town. Hiroshi. Please be careful.
