Traumatic head injury... from where you hit the windshield. The doctor says... you might suffer from memory loss. Temporary, they hope. Who are you? Honey... I'm your wife. And I'm gonna make you all better. Did you know the noodle is not an Italian discovery? In spite of its popularity in the West, chicken noodle soup was actually first created by the Chinese. The doctor says we need to keep your brain as rested as possible. Which means not a lot of light. Not a lot to look at. It was a bad accident. I don't remember. How did it happen? You made a mistake, honey. We have plenty of time to answer questions. Now you need your rest. Honey, you shouldn't be out of bed. You need to take it easy. Hmm. Reddecker. All right, well, what's your story? All right, well, people go missing all the time. If I don't find him dead, I'll find him in the next small town... complaining about this small town. What else you got? A ransom note. All right. Well, send it over. I don't give a damn what you write. Let me tell you what I'll do. I'll take clips from your article and I'll put it in my scrapbook. It's about time, sleepyhead. I was starting to get worried I'd never see those beautiful eyes again. How long was I asleep? Two days. Jesus. The doctor says it's natural for a brain in your state to get that much rest. Doctor? Mm-hmm. I heard... I heard voices and... I saw figures in my sleep. It was the doctor? Mmm. See? Getting better already. I'm gonna start cooking dinner. You shouldn't be out of bed, honey. My foot... doesn't feel broken. You're taking a lot of pain medication. You're not gonna be feeling much of anything. I feel lost. Everything is new to me. Like the cats. I keep hearing cats. I don't remember ever having cats. Well, we do. Since you made it all the way down here, do you want to eat like a couple? The way we used to? Yeah. Good, because I made your favorite. My favorite? I'm sorry. Sometimes I forget you forget. Pot roast. You love my pot roast. When did we... move in here? Not long before the accident. So you had to go through all this? You shouldn't have to take care of me. I don't have to. I want to. You're my husband. Now let's eat. Come on, babies. Elephants are dying of coronaries. Excuse me? In the jungle. They're dying of stress about their dwindling food and water supply. It's the stress that really kills them. Do you remember? No. You don't remember about the elephants? I don't... I don't remember. What do you remember? I don't remember where I grew up. You don't remember our senior bowl? Kissing me by the creek? You don't remember? I want to. I'm sorry. Did you know the first can opener, it wasn't even invented... until 50 years after the first tin can was even produced. Wow. I've missed you. Have we been... happy? You have to ask? I think I just reminded you. Do you want me to remind you again? How did we first meet? Love at first sight. Where did we go on our honeymoon? Up north. Where up north? I wish the accident hadn't messed with your brain. How did it happen? Why weren't you hurt? I was thrown from the car. Let's not talk about it just yet, honey. It will only upset you. I just want to think happy thoughts. There was a wreck on Highway 83. No victims were found, but blood samples were taken. Did you run plates? Yes, sir. The car hasn't been registered since the '60s. It's a powder-blue Thunderbird. How many victims? We don't know for sure yet. Judging from the belongings in the car, two adults and a young girl. What was the weather? Fair. So no rain. No rain, sir. Okay. All right. Should I, um... Give me an address? Yes. - Right now? - Now would be good. Okay. Thank you, sir. Mm-hmm. Dad. Dad. What are you doing, honey? I was looking for you. Mmm. You shouldn't be out of bed. Please. I worry about you so much. Especially since the accident. You're right. I'm sorry. Why don't you go upstairs and undress? I'll be up in a minute to draw your bath. No. It's okay. I can do it myself. This is a marriage. We help each other. Okay, well, I'll be waiting upstairs. Yes, isn't it? Mmm. There's a part of my nightmare... that I can't shake. Keeps coming back. There's... a girl, calling "Dad." Ever notice that battery sizes... come in "A," "C" and "D"? Why not "B," you ask? B-size batteries never caught on in products made for consumers, so stores stopped carrying them. You can find them in Europe though, where they're used to power bicycle lamps. Tell me something about yourself. I want to get to know you... again. Do you have other family? Do I? I want to get to know you. The woman that I love. Okay? I hate talking about my past. You knew that once. I just want to focus on our future. This is my film room. It's where I make movies. I don't remember. I can't remember any of this. I don't know what's yours, what's mine, where I can go... and where I can't. I forget sometimes too. That's okay. That's why I have this room. It's full of memories. To help me remember. I know this has been hard for you. Will you help me remember? I will. What's in that room? It's just a room. Another bedroom? Just a room. I thought I saw somebody in there. What do you mean? Behind the door. I thought I saw somebody. I was just curious. You know what they say about curiosity. I'm just trying to get my bearings straight. I know, honey. I know. I'm gonna go to the store and stop by work. I have to go check on my patients. Will you be okay with that? Yeah. What's wrong, honey? I've been in the basement. I saw him. I saw what you did. I told you to never go down there. I've never kept my first husband a secret from you. Who are you? I'm the woman who loves you, who takes care of you, who feeds you, who bathes you... and makes love to you. I'm your wife. You seem a little depressed lately. Honey, do you know anything about electroconvulsive therapy? Also commonly referred to as shock therapy. Dates back to the 16th century in Eastern Europe, but really gained popularity in the United States in the 1930s. Although the therapy is controversial, it is still used today in this country and around the world, primarily to treat severe depression. I think this will help you, honey. I really do. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. See? That wasn't so bad, now, was it? Hmm? No. No. Did you know Conway Twitty had 55 number-one hits? Hmm? That's more than Elvis Presley. Do you understand how important family is? Strong families are the backbone to this society. There's nothing more beautiful... than the foundation of a husband and wife, raising their children in a proud home. I just need you to look to the future, that's all. Forget the past. M-My body. Oh, it hurts. The shocks can leave a little bit of an aftereffect. Please make it stop. Oh, please. Oh, make it stop. Do you love me? Do you? Yes. I love you too. Do you want this to stop? Yes. Well, I want something too. I want a baby. Isn't that what every wife wants from her husband? A baby? I want a baby, a family to call my own. Do you want this to stop? Yes. Yes. Give me a family, and it will. Give and take. That's what a good marriage is about. Memories are wonderful, don't you think? I know you were curious, since you looked at my family album. I always know when you look at my things. You don't put them back properly. Why are there no photos of us? Where are they? That's not you. None of them are you. Hello. How are you, Dave? Always great when I can see you. Oh, aren't you sweet. I have a piece of registered mail. I need your signature for it. Oh. Just a minute. Why don't you come in. Go into the kitchen. I'll be right there. All right. You need to behave when we have guests. That's for good measure. Is everything all right? I found you a pen. Oh, thank you. Let me get that. What are you doing? You want to know more about me? Look at me when I talk to you. You want to know more about my past? Or would you like to know more about your past? What? About what happened the night of the accident. When are you going to tell me? You really don't know? No. How could I? Honey, I put things to sleep for a living... and they don't wake up. Did you know that? I don't fucking care. This is what dreams are made of. One day you'll wish you cared more. Who is she? I keep seeing her... in my dreams. Is she my daughter? Is she our daughter? Please just tell me she's okay. I have work to do. Hey, listen. I'm swamped. I'm gonna work from the office. Swing your squad car by the bird streets, where... Magpie meets Mockingbird. Check that out. What do I think? I think he had a stroke and is dead, lying under a bush with a bag of undelivered mail. All right. Let me know. Help! Help! Help me! Help! Help! Help me! Help! I'm in here! Help! I'm in here! Help! She should have left our family alone. Did you know that the bottle cap is more expensive to produce... than the actual bottle itself? I am up out of my chair. This had better be important. Oh, hell, I don't know. Well, maybe she just ran off with the mailman. Did you call the officer? Did you go by her house? No? Well, here's a theory... She's at home putting her kid to sleep. Oh, and another thing... She is off-duty. All right. I will knock on a few doors on my way home. Now, if I come up missing, you'll know one thing... I will be dead. You wanted to know more about yourself. I hope you're ready. It's okay. Don't cry. Shh. Oh, my God. You don't even remember our own daughter, Audrey? Don't tell me you don't at least remember her. She's been a bad girl. I had to put her in time-out. Don't hurt her. Please. You can't do this. That is up to you. - Let her go. - I will. Once you agree to get me pregnant. I need another child. Audrey has just grown up so quickly. Everything's gonna be fine. Okay? Whatever you want. Please, let her out. That's a good start. Are you gonna be a good girl? Good. Move on. Don't we look beautiful? Don't ruin your makeup. Honey, I have a surprise for you. Now, don't we look like the perfect family? Go on, honey. I think it's finally time to tell Daddy... what happened the night of the accident. Don't! Help me. Help me, please. If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. Thirsty. Family is forever. No matter what. As long as you're alive, counting together other people's happy moments... as if they're your own... Your life, your memories, are what you want them to be. Did you know that Walter Freeman invented... what is called the ice pick lobotomy? Freeman would hammer the pick just above the tear duct... and wiggle it around. From 1936 to 1950, the physician would travel cross-country in a van he called... the lobotomobile... to demonstrate the procedure to medical centers. This was heralded as a great advance in surgery, and was advocated as a general cure to all perceived ills, including misbehavior in children. I have never done an ice pick lobotomy before, and I would never do my first one on Audrey. I know it's a little extreme. I never intended to do this, but I get the feeling that the two of you will never be happy here. At least thank me for having the good sense to try one on you first, instead of Audrey. Hmm. Now, who could be calling at this time of night? Sorry to bother you, ma'am. I'm investigating a missing persons report. I'm sorry to hear that. I-I haven't seen anyone. I'm running a bath. Will you excuse me? Thank you. You ruined my floor. You ruined my floor! Dad? Relax. You're safe now. My daughter... What's wrong with her? Is she... You are lucky to be alive. Where... Is she okay? Wh... What's wrong with her? I'm her father. Where am I? Where... What happened to my daughter? Left with a question. Question? Is she okay? My daughter? Is she okay? Is she here? She is? Is she... Is she okay? What? My daughter. Is my daughter okay? Is sh-she... Now rest. Oh, my God. I need my daughter. My daughter. My daughter, I... I need to see her. I need to see my d... I need to... I'm her father. I'm her father. Dad! I'm the detective assigned to your case. Oh. Well, I need your help, Detective. Oh, I'm sure you do. You know how you got here? No. Shall we hold hands as we walk down memory lane? Let's start with Audrey. My daughter. Why do you think she's your daughter? B-Because she is. How do you know she is your daughter? She... She told me that she was. Who? My wife. What's your wife's name? I don't know. What's your name? I don't know. All I know is I have a daughter... named Audrey. Not your daughter. Audrey Williams, daughter of Mason Williams. A very wealthy individual. When she went missing, a ransom note appeared in the mail. We have to do this. We need the money for my treatments. If you want a baby, let's do this. If I want a baby? If we want a baby. That's what makes us a happy family. Do you care to tell me how your handwriting got on the ransom note? Got this handwriting sample from your house. No, no. No. We know you kidnapped her. Audrey identified you. Hi there, darlin'. We're new to the area. We're a little lost. Would you mind helping us? Thank you. So... Just take the left to, uh... after... Mm-hmm. You're facing a lot of time. To the fact, the three murder victims we found in the basement of the house... That's life. I didn't kill anyone. If you can't remember your name, how do you know you didn't murder these people? She did it. She hasn't been found. Which puts you in the right place at the wrong time. Or the wrong place at the right time. Or the wrong place at the wrong time. That's two wrongs. Right? I didn't do it. Folks do lots of things these days to have kids. I don't wanna do this. - This is a bad idea. I want to take her back. - This was a gift for us. Do you need help remembering? A lot of avenues to choose from. Very expensive roads couples go down to achieve a family. All of your fertility experiments are right here, with each and every one of your bills piling up. Desperate times call for desperate measures. She wanted a baby in the oven at any cost, and you planned this kidnapping to pay for it. So, that's my memory? Yes. Dad. I want my dad. I want my dad. The doctor says we need to keep your brain as rested as possible. Which means not a lot of light. Not a lot to look at. Honey, I put things to sleep for a living, and they don't wake up. Did you know that?
