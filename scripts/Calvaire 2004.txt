Since love is our only hope, and unity's a powerful force. Let's go together, on a dream cruise. Bring your week next to mine, that'll make us a fair two-weeks. We'll face anything with tenderness. A velvet game, that could last for ever. Bring your week next to mine, that'll make us a fair two-weeks. We'll be together as the mind and the body. For all our life, we'll do fifty-fifty. Merry Christmas everybody ! I'm really happy to meet you again. A new year is about to begin, I wish you a year full of joy full of happiness, but above all... full of songs... ...love songs, of course. Yes, come in. Come in, have a seat. I'm just taking this off. Marc, it was such a pleasure again. Thanks Mrs Langolf. May I help you? Your songs are a source of youth for me... a source of memories... You know... next year... I may not be here, when you come back. Don't be silly, you'll be here. May I ask you something? Of course, anything you want... You looked at me during the show. I don't know what happened to me... I'm sorry. I can't believe it, you dirty old bitch... You cunt, look what you've done... you've ruined it all. Where are you going now? South...for a Christmas show. Some producers should be there. I hope you'll come back when you're a star. Of course I'll come back. Excuse me. Everybody loves you here Marc, you know that ? Well, I gotta go... Oh, of course... Thanks a lot. Marc...Marc. May I kiss you before you go ? We will miss you. Oh Marc...we will miss you. Please let me go now. I gotta go. Did you see a dog...a short haired dog? That big...with short hair. Excuse me? I'm looking for my dog. I saw something on the road... couldn't tell if it was a dog. You saw her ? No, I saw something cross the road, but I can't tell if it was her. Where did she go? I don't know... this way I think. There, this way... Hey come back ! Come back young man ! Come back ! Hey young man...come back! My name's Boris. Ok Boris, can you help me ? My van's stuck and I saw a sign for an inn. The inn ? The inn isn't far away. But I gotta find Bella. Just tell me where it is, that's all I need. Can you please tell me where the inn is ? Follow me. But be quiet, so I can hear Bella. Hey wait, I can't live my van here ! I asked you to be quiet. Are you sure I can leave my van there all night ? Are we getting close now ? Sir, I asked you to be quiet, and it means being silent with your mouth. Mister Bartel ! Mister Bartel ! I got someone for you. He's coming down. I got someone for you Mr Bartel. He needs a room. Good evening. Evening. I'm sorry to wake you up, my van broke down and... Allright, come in. The rooms have been empty for quite a while, but don't worry, they're clean. Here you are. Good night. You slept well artist? Very well, thank you. I towed your van, I know a bit of mechanics, if I can help... Thanks, but... Among colleagues, that's natural... Hey, I've read the inscription. Move away please. Singer? I'm an artist too...well I was. A humorist You're an artist for life, but it's not what it used to be... I hope you didn't tow my van with the handbrake on. So we're like...colleagues. I'm going to fix you a breakfast, I'll check your engine afterwards. Can't we call a mechanic? I don't want to disturb you. Bella. There must be a mechanic around here. - We could call... - Shut up Since he lost his dog, he's not the same guy anymore. You got a phone inside? May I? You must have a phone inside. Excuse me? Do you have a phone inside ? Of course I have a phone... what do you think ? Oh...all right...yes... so...when will he be back ? This afternoon ? Maybe ? Are you sure or not ? All right, all right, thanks, good bye. - It was his wife. - So? He's working outside. He's busy for the afternoon, maybe longer. Don't worry... I'm gonna have a look at your engine. - Are you such in a hurry ? - I've got quite a long road. Where are you going? South, for a Christmas show. Christmas! It's in 2 days. An artist like you should rest for a while from times to times.. You must be right. Come on, I'm gonna fix you a good breakfast, then I'll have a look at your machine. Thanks Sir. Bartel. Call me Bartel. No Sir here, only an artist. All right Bartel. Have a seat. Can I help you? No, no...I'm sure you don't know a thing about mechanics, do you ? You're right, I must admit that. That's what I thought. I'm taking care of this, go get some rest. I was going to walk around I should advise you against going to the village. Why ? Because they're not like you and me... They're not artists. So please, don't go there. OK, but tell me why. Because they are...they can.... they...they are... Ok, Bartel, calm down, I won't go to the village. - You promise? - Yeah I promise. See you later. So, have a good walk my friend ! Be careful, paths are slippery at this time of the year... - You're driving me crazy. - - Marc, we love you. - - Marc, come back soon ! - - Oh Marc, if you knew... - - I languish for you - That's a good one, he's fine, he's tender. Go ahead. Come on kid... and what am I supposed to do ? I never said it was your fault. All right, All right. So ! How was your walk ? It's very nice around here. You went to the village ? No, I just walked in the surroundings. Anything new ? I worked hard on your van... The engine's all right, I think it's the battery. I just talked to the mechanic's wife, he could fix it... ...but tomorrow. - Tomorrow ? That's what I told them ! I'm gonna try to start it again. Marc, wait...wait. You can't start it, I've spent the afternoon trying. Trust me. Don't insist. I understand, you're disapointed... I can understand that. I'm gonna fix you a good dinner, you'll taste Bartel's cooking, and I promise you'll leave tomorrow. Here you are. Lard and potatoes au gratin, with cream. It's my specialty. It was... when the inn was still open. A lot of peole used to come here... ...especially artists. Now that Gloria's gone... it's not the same anymore. Gloria. My wife. You're married ? I called her my wife, but she left me. She was a singer, just like you. Very talented. You should have heard her. I'm sorry to bring back bad memories. How could you know... So what's the problem? With the villagers I mean. You should have heard her. It's was marvelous. She was everything for me. I lost everything when she left me. That's why I'm so happy to meet another artist. I'm gonna show you something. You see. It's written on it. First prize. I won it thanks to my sense of humor. When she left, Bartel's sense of humor left too. Bartel's fantasy...gone. While when she was here, when Gloria was here, I was happy all the time, I was crooning all day long... I was kidding, I was always the first one to crack a joke... Listen. A dwarves association... ...decides to create a football club. So... They play games every Sunday. and... they meet in a bar, on the first floor, in a private room. One sunday, there's this guy, standing at the bar, he's quite messed up already, and then he sees 2 dwarves, dressed in blue, coming down the stairs. then 3, then 4, 5, 6, 10, 11 ! He thinks he's having hallucinations, then, he pours himself... he orders another whisky, then he sees dwarves again, dressed in red, coming down the stairs, He orders another whisky, and calls the bartender, and he says... I don't want to worry you, but I think your Foosball's running away ! Your Foosball's running away ! That's a good one, isn't it ? And I'm not telling it right ! Back in the days, People were rolling on the floor laughing. You know why ? Enthusiasm Marc. Enthusiasm I tell you. Enthusiasm is the key to success. When Gloria left, I decided to fill my head with work, I decided to write an essay, "Notions... ...of enthusiasm in the principles of humor. " It was the title. I never finished it. I never finished it, 'cause when a woman leaves you... You become a mess. It was very good. But I got a long road tomorrow. I need to sleep. Already ? You're gonna leave without... ...singing me a song ? I beg your pardon ? You got to sing me a song... show me your talent. I don't know, it's late and I'm tired. Come on, don't make me beg you. We're both artists. I did told you a story. Ok, but I don't know what to sing, I got no music... Improvise. A love song. Love songs are always great. I told you: enthusiasm is the key. Like a rose of May, Youth and beauty were given to you, Me, in the dark, staring at my life, I see too many looks shining with envy, You're too beautiful and too sensual, for a guy like me. I've the simple dream, of a peaceful happiness, you couldn't give me. Here you are. You mean that's all ? I didn't tell you half a story. You have to finish that song. You're too beautiful and flirting wouldn't be enough for me. I'd like to offer you my bed, but for all my life. Even the dove, happy in its nest, sometimes flies away, for ever to infinity. I'm afraid, but am I right or wrong, that some day you fly away, making for new horizons. You're too beautiful and too sensual, for a guy like me. I've the simple dream, of a peaceful happiness, you couldn't give me. You're too beautiful and flirting wouldn't be enough for me. I'd like to offer you my bed, but for all my life. This time it's over. I'm going to bed. Don't forget to wake me up tomorrow. - Marc. - Yes ? Thanks for this wonderful moment. Bartel ? Anybody here ? Bella ! Boris. I'm looking for Bartel. - You hear me ? - Leave me alone. Please answer me. You saw him ? - I'll never find her again. - Who ? Bella, my dog. I'm sorry about your dog but did you see Bartel ? She's alone in the woods. In the cold. Bella...Bella... Boris do you hear me ? I'm looking for Bartel. Lost. - Boris. - She must be so afraid... Can I help you ? I was looking for you. The door was open, I thought... I was ordering a new battery for your van. The mechanic should be here soon. Just wait a little more. You didn't wake me up and I got a problem with my van. You were sleeping so well I didn't want to woke you up... You found it? You left it yesterday night... I was about to give it back to you. What are you doing ? You're crazy ! Stop ! Calm down Bartel, I don't wanna hurt you. That's what you're looking for ? That's what you're looking for ! Why do you leave now you're back, you wanna step on my heart again ? What are you doing ?
