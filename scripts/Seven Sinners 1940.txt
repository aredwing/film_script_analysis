I'm just sitting here, minding my own business. Oh. - Rubio! - Yes, sir? - Another fight and I'll close your dive. - What can I do? They all fight. - Where is this girl Bijou? - She's gone. Bijou had nothing to do with this. - Quiet! Where are you from? - The Navy. - There's nothing American in port. - I uh... I was in the Navy. I see. I gave this girl a whole lot of money. I wanted her to sing. She won't come out. He thinks he buys her so he starts for her dressing room. Liar! - See? - Report to the magistrate at 10:00! - Take him out! - Come on. I warned you about Bijou a month ago. Have her at the magistrate 10:00. Hey, you! You too. Yes, sir. James Clyde, convicted of disorderly conduct and vagrancy. To be deported. Andre Boiler... Stop that smoking back there. Disorderly conduct, vagrancy. Deported. Luigi Coreo, petty larceny, disorderly conduct, vagrancy. Deported. Sasha Menken. Sasha Menken? - Coming. - Disorderly conduct, fraud, vagrancy. Your Honour, the disorderly conduct and fraud, I admit - they're minor offences. But the vagrancy charge is a tissue of lies! A tissue of lies. - You have no visual means of support. - I'm a magician. - You're a pickpocket, a petty thief. - Do I say no? But I am a magician. Look. You impudent pickpocket! How dare? Sticks and stones may break my bones, but... goldfish. May I have my watch now, please? Certainly, sir. And it's perfectly dry. Allow me to put it back. Your Honour, I rest my case. All right, all right, you're a magician. And you're a fair and brilliant official. Deported. Get out. Patrick Edward Finnegan, alias Ned Little. Disorderly conduct, vagabond. Deported. - Hey, Chief, how's chances for a fair trial? - You're getting one. Outside. - Bijou? - Hey, now, wait a minute. It's OK to push us tramps around but that lady is playing a lone hand. She's got to get a square deal, or else I'm gonna start trouble. I'm sorry. I just gotta. - Bijou! - Bijou! - Bijou! - Coming! That's what happened to the farmer's daughter. - Give me a penny. - Don't go so far away. Don't worry, boys. When I settle down, I'll send word to all naval units. - Cable code is "Man overboard". - Bijou. I'm fixed. Good morning... Curlylocks. - Three times I had to call you... - Just a minute. As you were, Big Boy. Take him out to be deported. - You're accused... - Of inciting a riot, being a public nuisance. I make rough seas, I set the jungle on fire. I'm a bad influence. - So I'm to be... I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, too. But we've had half a dozen complaints since you came to that caf. A half-dozen? Why not 50? I'm surprised. You know, handsome, when I stop singing to you and you say, "Mm, darling," then I say, "Mm-mm, goodbye." You don't get drunk and roar and fight. You're nice. - It's the judgment of this court... - The minute Bijou is in trouble, she's out. To be deported, so the court says. - You must realise... - Don't feel sorry for me, Curly. The next island will be wonderful. Bijou will sing again and the caf will be full. And may an angel take my place here. It'll serve you right, Curlylocks. Goodbye, Bijou. Gangway, gangway! Gangway, gangway! Gangway, gangway! When are you coming back, Bijou? When are you coming back, Bijou? Hey, the governor. Oh. That's the man who's deporting us, huh? - Who is that? - Just human backwash, Miss Henderson. Steerage passengers, report to the doctor. You're a very lucky girl I'm along. Everything's gonna be all right. Remember, this belongs to you. Of course. Everything is going to be just dandy. - Turn around. - There's nothing wrong with me. - I know. I just wanna look at the pictures. - Oh. - Cute, ain't she? - Beautiful. Put on your shirt. That's all. Hey, mate. There's a little lady aboard, name of Bijou. I want you to give her a break, see? That's all. I'm uh... kinda looking out for her. We'll be known all over the Thousand Islands as Sasha The Great and Company. With Bijou. I tell you, it's simple mathematics. Look what happens. Little Ned does the work and we collect. There's nothing to the big gorilla. He can fetch water and props and fan us when it's hot. - Where was your brain with the judge? - As you were, Big Boy. He'll think of me every time he wants to know the time. - Remember. - Yes, I know. This belongs to me. Uh-uh. Strip to the waist. You see how it is, Doc, I can't take my clothes... Strip to the waist! Yes, sir. Oh, Susie, Susie! Come on back, honey, come on back to Daddy. I won't let that doctor hurt you. Come on, honey! Oh. I've raised Susie from an egg, Doc. I've seen some queer riffraff. Deposit that stuff outside and come back later. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I bet you Susie's waiting for me out there. Susie! Susie! Break it up! Strip to the waist. - What do you think you're doing? - You said to take off my dress. Well, forget it, never mind. - My head's full of pigeons and rabbits. - Are they pink? Inhale. Where's nice old Dr Kramer? Is he dead? How should I know? Inhale. - Do you examine the goats too? - Inhale, please. Isn't it a bit early in the morning for Cognac and rabbits and things? It's a bit soon for impertinence. Turn around. The funny thing about rudeness - when I say it, it's impertinence. - When you say it, it's importance. - You talk too much. Hold still. Cough. Inhale. Inhale. What's the hurry? The next stop is a week from now. - Right, but you're holding up a lot of people. - We're just human junk to you. But we do come in handy. Turn around. - What's your name? - Bijou. - Bijou what? - Just Bijou. - For my friends. - Hmph, Bijou! Yes, Bijou. Wouldn't you be lonesome if you had no Bijous to kick around? Bijou, Bijou. Bijou, yes, there it is. - "Deported. Health A1..." - All right, I can read. - Aren't you used to being deported? - I am. You can get used to anything. You can get used to the plague but I don't like it. Wait a minute. I'm no plague. Maybe I haven't been cordial... - Cordial? - All right, so I've been rude. I'm sorry. - Here, have a drink. - Oh, no. I've tried that. And when I try, I try hard. Well, I prescribe it, it'll do you good. Better to know what you're doing. Even if it's wrong. So long, Doc. - Health A1? - Sure, health A1. - How did it go? Did he treat you rough? - Just routine. Good evening, Dr Martin. May I present you to Miss Henderson? - How do you do? - Dr Martin. She's going to join her father in Boni-Komba. He's the new governor. Boni-Komba... - Excuse me. - It's my first trip out here. I'm very excited. - I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself. Good night. - Good night. Dream a while, scheme a while And you will find Happiness, and I guess All the things you've always wanted Gee, I like to see you looking swell, baby Diamond bracelets Woolworths doesn't sell, baby Till that lucky day, you know darned well, baby I can't give you anything but love I can't give you anything but love, baby That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby Dream a while, scheme a while And you will find Happiness and I guess... More, please. It's grand! Oh, you want a performance, huh? Genius, perform for the lady. We enjoyed it too. - I didn't mean to hurt her feelings. - Oh, I wouldn't worry. I'll tell her. Oh, please, do, will you? Sumatra, out. Java, out. Boni-Komba, out. - Mapping a campaign? - No, a retreat. I'm running out of islands. This isn't a professional visit. I just wanted to tell you that the young lady up on deck didn't mean to be rude. Oh, yeah? Who is the sweet thing? Her name is Henderson. Her father happens to be the new governor of Boni-Komba. I thought you might like to know. Boni-Komba? Governor Henderson? - The new governor. - She didn't mean to offend you. If she's the governor's daughter, she couldn't offend me. - Cause for rejoicing? - Rejoicing? Doctor, you have lifted the Pacific Ocean right off my neck. Now I can go back to Boni-Komba. How about a celebration? Yes, you come to Tony's caf, Seven Sinners in Boni-Komba. Ho-ho. How frightened Tony will be when he sees me. But then, he'll celebrate! How about my cabin for a snack? A snack is food. So I ran to the end of the world and jumped off and here I am. Mm. So nice and peaceful here. I don't blame you for running away. Are you sure? When the girl married the man with the money, - why didn't you make more money? - For what? So I could buy her back? Good, I'll tell it that way next time. - Let me have the story of your life. - I tell it many different ways. - Which one would you like to hear? - Go right ahead. Well, there's a lovely version about a little girl from a convent in Marseille. Get out your handkerchief because this is awfully sad. And a young, dashing officer from Saigon and wedding bells. Ding dong. He drank like a fish. He's dead. Grape juice? No, thanks. Wait a minute. Come up like this every night, will you? Thanks. You're a good doctor. - I might get to like it. - Then why hurry? Sleep. Last night was bad, very bad. I shall miss you very much. Sure. In the evening. You must have someone to sit around and drink all the grape juice. - I'll be here waiting. - Yes, when they throw me out. When you're tired, I'll still be here. Oh, my smoking career would get in your nostrils. That shouldn't make any difference. Couple of friendly derelicts. - I'm not quite ready for the word "derelict". - I'm sorry. You're the kindest man I've ever met. Got a penny? Bye, Doc. Run aground, miss? I'll give you a hand. - Oh, Lieutenant Brent. - Miss Henderson. Captain. - Shall we go? - Goodbye. - Your father was sorry he couldn't be here. - I'm sure he was. I can tell you this, from your father down to the last guard, the Navy's ready for you. - Uniforms spick and span, parades. - Sounds enchanting. Lieutenant, I shall report you for want of attention. Yeah. Huh? Oh. There'll be no lack of attention. We've been waiting for you too long. Shove off. - Hey, Ned. - Oh. Hello. I got the bags. Rickshaw? I've been saving it for you. - Caf Seven Sinners. - Caf Seven Sinners. Gangway! Gangway, rickshaw! Rickshaw! Rickshaw, gangway! Gangway, gangway, gangway, gangway! Wait here. I want to talk to Tony alone. I'll see him, I can sell anything. Gangway! Take care of him, Big Boy. - I can't give you anything but love, baby... - No. - That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby... - No. No. - Bijou! - Yes, I've come back home again. Bijou is home again. Please, my heart is not so good. But you look new. The place, it looks new and nice. Yes and it's going to stay new and nice. Yes. We won't have any more riots. We're going to keep it that way, huh? We are going to do nothing. Bijou, sit down. No, don't sit down, stand up. Your boat is going to leave in an hour. I'll buy you a drink. Bijou, I love you. I adore you. You're wonderful. But you are too much. Bring the drinks. No, thanks. I'm on the grape-juice wagon. Antro. Did it get too hot for you in Sumatra? Run along, babies, and hurry. Be gone when I come back up here. Ah. An angel from Lotus Street... in Sumatra. Yes, my gorgeous one. But even Sumatra is dull, deadly dull without you. And this dump? For 48 hours, I have tried to rip fun out of this place. Then suddenly, I turn around. Is this Bijou, Tony? Or am I too drunk? Hm? So Bijou is going to sing for you again, Tony? Good. It is not yet arranged. It is now. Whatever became of that big knife? Were the police in Sumatra touchy about returning it afterwards? Or were you shy about claiming it? Ooh. The Navy. See you later, dear Antro. - The Navy? - Well, in there is only a little bit of Navy. What a girl. She incites me to my teeth and I like it. I love it, my friend! I love it! I beg your pardon? - May I have an American cigarette? - Have one of mine. Thank you. Thanks. Bijou Blanche. - Bijou to the Navy. - That's us! Go on with your game. I'll watch you, if you don't mind. - Come on... - There's your cue, Judson. - I got a buck that says he can't make it. - I got a buck that says he does. - Any more takers? - There he goes. That's easy money. Come on. Oh, come on, hit the ball. Not very good. Here he goes, boys. Here he goes. - You wanna make that shot, sailor? - Uh-oh. - I sure do. - All right, I'll help you. Now, you put your hands on mine. - Is that what you mean? - Yes, that's what I mean. - I see what you mean. - What are you shaking about, Judson? - Shut up, will ya? - Come on. Give the man a chance. The one ball is blocked, that's too tough. So we play billiard combination and put the 12 in the right-side pocket. That's a tough shot. Easy, easy. She did it! - Do you really wanna see a tough one? - Come on, show us. All right. - Say, do you know? - Wait a minute. Now, the two will go in that corner. the 14 in there, 15 in that pocket. Now bet. - One dollar. - One dollar. Such easy money. She made it! Let that be a lesson - never gamble with strangers. Hey, they got blackouts here. You discovered America. Here, I work for nothing. Sure. - Remember what Bijou said. - Hey! The flophouse is two doors down below. This is no place for loafers. Come on! Get outta here! Get outta here. Go on! You see, I... You tell me I've got to hire Bijou. Why don't you tell me to set fire to the place? It's the same thing. While the place burns, let's have fun. I don't want any fun. Ten minutes ago, I was the boss. You'll be boss as long as you keep Bijou happy. Here. - Buy her some dresses, lots of them. - Wait a minute, bud. Bijou buys her own dresses. - Didn't I told you to get outta here? - I'm your new bouncer. - I tell you... What? - Bouncer. I'm your magician, waiter, juggler and dancer. Waiter, juggler, dancer, bouncer? Who told you that? - Bijou. - That's enough. That's enough! That's enough! You seem to have whipped the Navy into a furious sense of duty. Mr Judson and Mr Henckel have duty in the morning and wish to say good night. - How splendid. Did I do that? - I'll give you the credit. Uh, we're going to have boxing on board Saturday night. Would you like that? - I'd love it. - Splendid. - Well, how do you like us? - You're wonderful. Oh, by the way, Austin, Wilson, Robbins and uh... oh, yes, Vance, they wanted me to say good night and they had a wonderful time. - Duty first, Father. - Mm, yes, yes. Undoubtedly. Splendid, just splendid. - Will you pardon us? - Yes, of course. - Shall we dance? - Aren't you going to the Seven Sinners? - Here she comes! - Bijou! See those shoulders broad and glorious See that smile, that smile's notorious You can bet your life the man's in the Navy See those nice blue trousers walk about That's that salty walk they talk about Mister, watch your wife The man's in the Navy Now, lots of men stand six foot seven And lots of men have arms like heaven And lots of men have hair all golden and wavy But when 10,000 gorgeous women'll Chase him like some hunted criminal You can bet your life the man's in the Navy See those shoulders broad and glorious See that smile, that smile's notorious You can bet your life the man's in the Navy...

And you're going to be on it! Shh! Just like old times! Oh, Tony, don't let's quarrel tonight, it's too marvellous. You insulted not only the Navy but one of the executive officers. - All right. I'll apologise. - You're not doing anything of the kind. You're going up to your dressing room and you're going to be very quiet. I promise to be on my best behaviour. I'm going to apologise. No, you're not. No, Bijou, please! I... - Are you looking for me? - No, I was going... Come on, sit down. Have a drink. This is your table. Sorry, I'm joining the Navy. You don't want to make a scene here, do you? No, I don't want to make a scene. Not for anything in the world. Oh. Bijou! As you were, as you were. That tall lieutenant didn't think I was so wonderful. - His face is a little red... - He won't be up for air for a month! - What's your ship, sailor? - The good ship Seven Sinners. - Bijou, did anybody ever tell you? - What? - I'm sure they have. - You gotta watch him, Bijou. - Bijou? - What is it? Uh... Antro is sitting there at the table, he wants to spend money. You remember me, I work for a living. And anyway, I'm in the Navy. Maestro, give. - All together, sing. - We sing?

Gangway! Boy, oh, boy, I'm sure happy. - We're sure a sensation in this place. - What do you mean "we"? - Take it back. - Yes, ma'am. - What do you see in that guy? - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? In my great joy, do I know what I'm doing? Beat it, boys. See you at the caf. Good morning, Missy Bijou. Good morning. OK, Charlie, give me the routine over here. - Missy Bijou, like a little potty? - Yes, I could use two or three. Oh, excuse me. Good morning, Miss Henderson. Can I do something for you this morning? - Go ahead, I can wait. - Take care of the lady, Charlie. And keep shirty on. May I say good morning, Lieutenant? Oh... May you say good morning! - I've been looking all over town... - Yes, it's such a big place, isn't it? - But I still sing at the Seven Sinners. - I haven't been in since... I know, I insulted you. Tony told me. He gave me a week to make things straight. I've only two days more. - Tony's wacky. I'll square him. - Do you really mean that? Mean it? Look deep into my honest blue eyes. No, grey. My honest grey eyes. Can you doubt me? Missy Henderson, thank you very much. Thanks an awful lot, Lieutenant. Homeside. Chop chop. Missy Bijou, like to buy little potty? Missy Bijou gotty litty potty. Haven't you got nothing better to do than stand here in the corner? Oh. I was reading. I like to read sometimes, it improves the mind. Don't break your arm, fella. Are you in the Navy? I was once but I missed my ship at Singapore. That's tough going. Hello, Tony. Lieutenant, ah, you come back. I'm so glad you're mad at me. I mean, I'm so mad, I'm mad at you. I'm glad you're mad... I'm... - You know what I'm saying. - Don't tell me, let me guess. Come on. Let's have a drink. - Did I tell her? - Gangway, gangway! Did I bawl her up? Well, you shouldn't have. It was entirely my fault. I know. Sure, Bijou is only a little bitty baby. A baby? Does he laugh by the hour, or is it piecework? You had a good laugh the other night too, didn't you? - Don't you like it? - Don't you go making no passes at a uniform of the United States Navy. I wouldn't for the world have anything happen to that beautiful uniform. Don't you forget it. I'm the bouncer here. Will you go over there and bounce yourself? See you later, Lieutenant. He thinks he's a rubber ball. Greetings, greetings and greetings. - Hi, Dan. - These amateurs giving you a show? - Amateurs? - How do you like that? - I saw Tony. - Oh, thank you. Bijou. Bijou, he thinks he's good. Does anyone think I'm not? - Bijou can take you. - Sure. Oh, gentlemen, huh? Letting her win. - Two bucks says you'll be a gentleman too. - Two bucks says I'm not. - Call it for the break. - Heads. Will you give me six bits against a half-dollar you're not a gent? It's a bet. Your break. Laughing boy is here again. If I bet you are no gentleman, I'm on your side. No? No. 15 points. - All right. - Two to one - for any amount. - I don't want to take your money. - You won't get any. Bijou and I are a tough team to beat. Shanghai, Bali, Sumatra. We were never a team - Shanghai, Bali, Sumatra or any other place. - About this game or anything else. - The blushing, sweet-scented flower. Is that a package you're selling? Look, Pollyanna... - You'll excuse us? - Take your time. After you. With pleasure. You know, you're old enough, there's some things you ought to be told. Uh... Uh, I don't think that climate in there agrees with you. As a matter of fact, I've been worried about your health altogether lately. You don't look well. It's just a little dizzy spell. Every time I look at you, I see eight or nine of you. - I'll be all right when I can only see one. - That can be arranged too. Careful of the uniform, Lieutenant. - Aw. Won't anybody give you a light? - Our hero! We were mighty worried about you, Lieutenant. You took the words right out of my mouth. Go ahead. I usually do my own fighting but thanks anyway. Got a penny? Sure. It's uh... an English penny, but... but it brought me a lot of luck. You took the words right out of my mouth. You've heard songs and singers too But there's nothing really new In the way these singers sing today Now I've a song that cannot miss But you must remember this To sing this song, you must be ooey-scray You've heard folks go boo-boo-be-do, boo-boo-be-dooby-do, boo-boo-be-do But you ain't heard folks go dig-a-dag-a-phut Dig-a-phut-phut, dig-a-dag-a-phut And you've heard folks go vo-do-ee-oh, vo-do-ee-oh-de-oh, vo-do-ee-oh But you ain't heard folks go dig-a-dag-a-phut Dig-a-phut-phut, dig-a-dag-a-phut Now, to sing this song, you must be gifted... Just a minute. And when you get your tongue all twisted, just go Dig-a-dag-a-phut-phut... Come in. - Oh, hello. - Oh, hello. Uh... I went hiking today and... These are wild flowers. - I see. - For you. I uh... You got me picking wild orchids. That's a new low. - Have you never done it before? - No, never. When I saw these and they made me think of you or... Or rather, I was thinking of you. Thinking of what? - Is there something I could do with? - Yes, I'll take them. Now, where were we? - You were thinking. - Oh, yes. What were you thinking of? Well, if you keep looking at me like that, I'm liable to tell you. What? Oh, that admiral's coat. Where did you? Can't you do something about it? - What's that? - Oh, that? Uh, nothing. Uh... look, if I get you something else, will you wear it? Yes. Come in. Hel... Oh, hello. I uh... was just on my way to the ship. The short cut through my dressing room. I uh... went hiking today. Oh, you did? Don't tell me, you were picking wild flowers? Yes. - Not uh... orchids? - Yes. - What was that? - Oh, the blackout. Oh. - You look handsome, Judson. - Gosh, it's dark. The blackout's a success. Heaven help a working girl on a night like this. That admiral's coat fooled me for a minute. Now, don't be frightened, darling, it's not Brent. Don't be nervous, I'm here. I won't. I hope you girls don't think I'm intruding? Hey! Hey! Hey! The lights went out all over town. - Well, it's a blackout. - They ought to notify people about... Find Sasha and bring him here now. - I'm sorry, boys, this is serious. - Well, go on. Gangway! Gangway! Oh. Come on. Take it easy. What's the matter? - Hand it over. - Don't know what you mean. - I do. You got a basket? - A basket? What are you doing? Wait! That ain't fair. Oh! Honestly, I don't know how it happened. I was working away... For once I'm going to make you laugh at each other. I will make horrible examples of careless people. Anyhow, if you have to lose things, why don't you lose something I would like? - Ensign James Scott. - Hey. Stand up. Is this your pocketbook? Gangway! - Why, yes. - How much money is there in it? - Only seven dollars. - The family wealth. That's very careless. Now, this I would know anywhere. Mr Antro. Next time there's a blackout, you'd better get under the table. I'm surprised, such a smart man. Now, who's this? Edward Patrick Finnegan. Edward Patrick Finnegan, speak up, come on! - But it's you. - Edward Pa... Oh. Now, let's see. Who here knows Helen in Singapore? Myrtle in Manila, Honore in Borneo. Oh, it's you. Yeah. Kid Romeo. Agnes in Tokyo and Mabel in Hong Kong. A ladykiller! And Becky in Barcelona. And Ruth in Trinidad. Ruth? Why, you! Lightfingers, you're getting your very last warning. I told you I like it here. It ain't the junk I want. The lights out. One, two, three, the lights on and nobody knows what happened. - I ain't no thief, I'm an artiste. - Ned. His lights will go out and they won't come on quick. He has my permission. Now, good night. - I might resign. - You heard the lady. Good night! Hello. I uh... was just hanging around to say good night. - Good night. - I haven't said it yet. - What? - Good night. Oh... Well? Good night. No. Not yet. Oh, I must. Because at this time of the night, I have no sense. Is that a fact? What? No sense, this time of night? No sense at all. Look me in the eye and swear to that. I swear. Tony is here, sir. - Oh. Come in, Tony. Come in. - Thank you... - Sit down, Tony. - Yes, I... I'm not tired. I... Tony, there's something I want you to do for me. If I can do it. Bijou is on the list of entertainers on board ship for the officers' party. - Yes. Lieutenant Brent, he's the one... - I'm not asking how it happened. I don't want to make official business of this thing. - She's very popular. The boys like her. - Yes, she's all right. But uh... there are some reasons why it might be as well if she didn't appear. Can't you take care of this thing and leave me out of it? Well, when Bijou makes up her mind, you know, it's very hard to change it. - You're her boss, aren't you? - Yes, I'm her boss... Yes, I'm her boss. Don't worry, I'll fix it. Well, I'm very grateful, Tony. It's a little bit awkward. You don't have to worry about awkward because when I tell Bijou who is the boss, she knows that I'm the boss and I'm going... Yes, she could be a little awkward. Well, try to make her understand, Tony, that the Navy has enough destroyers. Yes, I... What's your hurry? Did I tell you to hurry? I want to register a complaint. I think you are making a mistake, devoting so much time to the Navy. I see what you mean. Supposing I were to tell you I'm in love? It would be a pity. I'd have to get rid of that gentleman. Never mind. Run along and have a good time. - Don't let me spoil your fun. - Chop chop. Au revoir. Chop chop. - Admiral! Tell fortune! - Not today. Tell fortune, Admiral! Tell fortune! Wait a minute. Listen, listen, listen. Admiral! Your fortune, sailor? I got my fortune. Got it for a penny, remember? - I'm a little late. - A little late? I've been waiting for nine years. Flowers for Bijou. We're casting a funny shadow. Excuse me. Look, Junior, are you by any chance following me? - No, I ain't. - Fine. Then it's the lady you're following. You'd like to meet her? Is that it? Junior, this is Bijou. Bijou, this is Junior. Scram. - Flowers for Bijou. - Thank you. Flowers for Bijou. Same table? Imagine finding you here. I'm the type of girl you're liable to find anywhere. Flowers for Bijou. Not me. Excuse me. - What's so funny? - The kid gave you the flowers. Junior, you sure see things from a funny angle, don't you? How does it look from there? Oh, Dan, I wish you hadn't done that. I'm scared. You mean Antro? Don't let those professional house-haunters scare you. I've seen Antro haunt before. He never misses. Now, look, I'm going to do something I've never done in my life. I'm going to leave an island before I'm chucked off. Wait a minute. You're running away to save me. - I'm always running. What difference why? - Nothing doing. - I'm sorry. - You've got to stay. Them's orders. I'm not joking, sailor. I've played out my string here. I'd better move on. Then, I mean... I mean, my welfare means that much? Just what a sailor usually means to a girl. Well, you can't go. You know the penalty for desertion. - Desertion? - Yes. You promised to sing aboard ship. And I promised the officers. And a gentleman always keeps his word. And a sailor. And a sailor's girl. Doesn't make any kind of sense... but I'll never desert the Navy. Bijou, what are you doing? Whatever you say, I wouldn't believe it. Antro is screaming, there's crowds there. You're late. Tonight is Navy night, all aboard. Bijou, I forbid you to go on board that ship! That was the day before yesterday. Go to the ship. They'll show you a room where we'll dress. Take the piano player. You don't take no piano player and you leave the dressing rooms... Bijou, Antro is waiting with a crowd of knives. Er... with a bunch of people. I'll take care of Antro. You wouldn't want Bijou to miss this party, would you? I forbid it. I am the boss. Honest to goodness, I'm the boss. Oh. Something must have gone wrong. I'm sorry. See, I bringed you Bijou. - We've been waiting. - If I'd only known before. - But now you'll have to excuse me. - Sit down. I would love to but first, I'll have to tell the Navy that Mr Antro must be entertained. That's a great idea. Tell them in a letter. Champagne. Nikitos! Sasha is wonderful, ain't he? - Sasha is very clever. - Very. Once I heard he turned a streetcar into a side street... You stinking... Look! Straight from the barnyard. Oh. Oh! Who's laughing? I've been in love before It's true Been learning to adore just you Some old romance taught me how to kiss To smile like that And sigh like this I've been in love before You see Oh, darling, what a bore I'd be A heart that's lived a bit Can tell when it beats true I've been in love before Haven't you? - Congratulations, Dan. - Huh? - Oh. - Swell show. And I do like that kind of a band. - Uh... shall we dance? - What can we lose? Beg your pardon. May I cut in? Your song was swell. Wonderful. And so are... are you. It's been a good many years since I've done any dancing. Getting too old for that sort of thing. I getting so I get out of breath playing checkers. But I do like to see the young folks have a good time. Oh. Excuse me a moment. - Thank you, sir. - Excuse me. I beg your pardon. May I cut in? Certainly. Beg your pardon, sir, the captain would like to see you at once. All right. Yes, sir? I want you to see to it that that woman leaves the ship at once. - Orders, sir? - Orders. Aye aye, sir. - Someday, those people will drive me... - Darling, it's all my fault. - Your fault? - Yes. I shouldn't have come up again. But I wanted to dance with you and I don't regret it. - Well, if you don't, I guess... - I'm awfully glad you're mad. - Well, in that case... - No, no, you have to go back to the boat. - But wait a minute. - It's your job. But hurry. Hurry. Oh. - A welcoming committee. - Sure. Antro is waiting. Always, Antro is waiting. Tonight, in Tony's, waiting and drinking. And thinking, "If I stay here much longer, I'll be too drunk to welcome Bijou." Looking for this? It's no good. It's empty. Get out. Imagine Antro too drunk to be nice to Bijou after the Navy kicks her out. Bijou entertains the Navy and they kick her out. If she would entertain Antro... Maybe that's the trouble. I'm too nice to you. You are too beautiful. I should choke you. See that? That's the trouble. You make Antro sentimental. Come in. Uh... it was stuck. It was. Oh, Tony says you gotta come back to work right away or you'll be fired. That's all right, we were leaving anyway. Did you speak to the lieutenant about me? - No, not yet. I will tomorrow. - Oh, good. - I'm sorry, Mr Antro. - That's all right. - You sent for me, sir? - You're making a fool of yourself. - I don't know what you mean, sir. - This Bijou gal. It's developing into something else. - I'll admit nothing of the kind, sir. - Everybody knows. For two weeks... Everybody's a liar. With all due respect, sir, you have no right... - Of course I haven't any right. - Don't condemn her without knowing her. - We're shoving off soon. - Shoving off? Yes. It'll give you a chance to think things over. Well... I've thought things over. I'll be married before we sail. Married? It's a disgrace, you're in the Navy! - It's my own personal, private business. - Brent, I know all about these things. - It doesn't work, it never works. - Is that all, sir? No. I must ask you to remain on board until we shove off. Orders, sir? I wish you would. Thank you, sir. - Miss Bijou, sir. - Come in, please. - Would you be seated? - Thank you. Nice of you to come so promptly. - Cigarette? - Thank you. We've learned from Lieutenant Brent that he intends to marry you. Marry me? Dan said that? You were deported from here, let me see, nearly three years ago. You've been deported from several islands, always for the same reasons. Inciting a riot, questionable character. This is part of our records. And he wants to marry you. - He wants to marry me. - It's preposterous! I know Brent's family well. His father was an admiral. His grandfather was an admiral and they're proud of that. I trust I've made myself clear? You understand? Yes. Oh, yes, I do understand. You're a wonderful governor. Thank you so much. I don't know how to thank you. At exactly 5:43 and a half, I have an announcement to make. The governor just told me I'm going to be married. That's wonderful! That's marvellous! Nothing is too good for you. Nothing is good enough for you! Nothing is half good enough for you. - Hey, you're not going to marry me? - No, Tony. I'll be Mrs Lieutenant Dan Brent. Where's Little Ned? The super-stupid is having a hearing on a battleship. I have an idea and it's hot. The time to strike is when the iron is hot. That's marvellous! That's wonderful! Bijou! Bijou! Look, your first wedding present. Oh. - But they're real. - Would I give you anything phoney? Uh, look, don't wear them right away. Give them a little time to cool off. I'll tell you what you'll do. Return them just as cleverly as you took them. - And I'll never talk about it again. - All right, I'll return them. But I resent the implication. Shoreside. Chop chop. Well, you did it. Why? I was just aboard. What a mess you made out of that ship. Looks like a submarine smacked it. If you want a riot, stay where you belong. - Why, Ned. - The lieutenant's talking of resigning. And for you. He had a great career and you stopped him right in his tracks! Shut up! - What are you trying to make outta him? - Take your hands off me and get out! Shut up, you're off your nut. He'd kill you inside of six months. You've got no right to be an officer's wife! You fool! You don't know what you're talking about! When he thinks of all the years he's been in the Navy and all he's worked for has gone by the board, he's gonna hate your insides. You can't get the Navy out of your heart and your blood, honest you can't. If he didn't kill you, you'd do it yourself. You couldn't take it. And you wouldn't want to hurt anybody, especially a guy like him. It's cuckoo. That's... It's just cuckoo. It's cuckoo. Everything is rosy. I returned the pearls and nobody... The Malacca's in. It sails tomorrow. Get three tickets. Make it two. On board, they said I might get back in the Navy. Make it two. - The lieutenant will come to the caf. - No! I could see him once more. Even the Navy couldn't resent if I saw him once more. I'd better get down to the caf and pack, before he comes. Yes, I'll pack. He mustn't know until after I've gone. Aw, leave the poor dame alone. She's made up her mind. Hold this. Bijou, honeymoons is wonderful but not when business is wonderful. And business is wonderful and you're wonderful. Watch where you're... When somebody sends anybody some flowers, somebody must like anybody. That's why this... Oh... White, just like yours. You go and find Dan. Don't let him come in. Hit him if you have to but stop him. - I can't hit him, I want to be in the Navy. - Do anything but stop him. OK. The Navy song, boys. See those shoulders broad and glorious See that smile, that smile's notorious You can bet your life the man's in the Navy See those nice blue trousers walk about... Lieutenant? Lieutenant. Finnegan? - You can't go in there, Lieutenant. - I what? - You can't go in. She told me. - Why not? - You'll get in trouble. - Trouble? - You will get in trouble, Antro is in there. - Oh, he is? Well, that's for me. Please, Lieutenant. Chase him like some hunted criminal You can bet your life... Look, Antro, no uniform. Uh-oh, I got one of your dizzy spells. Stop the fight! Stop the fight! Gangway! - How do we know who to hit? - Any guy in a white coat. Blue, like yours. Hey, Lieutenant, where are you? Listen, you big bully, you can't do this to me. Lieutenant! Lieutenant, where are you? Over here, sailor! Stick with them, Lieutenant. Here comes baby! - Welcome aboard. - I'm happy to be aboard. - I'm going to get Antro. - Get to getting. Nice one, Lieutenant! - Watch out for the knife. - I'm watching! Look out! Get upstairs! - Thought I told you to stay outta here. - That's right, you did. Ned! In there, kid! Not a bad first round! Not so tough. Bijou, you've got to get out of here. If they catch you, they will deport you. What difference does it make if they deport me? - Bijou, who's the boss? - You're the boss. Sometimes, it's good to be the boss. Now, you lie still. I'll be back. I'm the boss. - Is he all right? - He's all right, just knocked out. Get him out. It's the police. Get him out! OK. - What will I tell 'em? - Anything. The truth, everything. But get him out of here. I should've recognised you before, Antro. - You report to the magistrate... - Yes. To the magistrate tomorrow. For inciting a riot, questionable character. To be deported. Hey, you. You too. Yes, sir. With your mind at rest, are you thoroughly reconciled and ready to go back to work? Yes, sir. By some miracle, you have escaped the consequences. But the Navy can neither countenance nor condone such rowdy behaviour. You will be restricted to the ship until further orders. - That's all. - Yes, sir. - Oh and, Brent. - Yes, sir? It might interest you to know that Mr Antro has two broken ribs, a broken collarbone and can't eat a bite. - Is that all, sir? - Isn't that enough? Oh. Yes, sir. Attention! And salute. To. Well, fellas, I hardly know what to... Well... what are you saving that button for? - Button it up, or cut it off. - Aye aye, sir. - Trim that cap. - Aye aye, sir. What is this? A bunch of Camp Fire Girls? Suck that in! Well, what are you waiting for? - Break it up. - Aye aye, sir. - I beg your pardon, sir. - Yes. Oh, Finnegan. - I have permission to speak to the officer. - You're looking good. It's thanks to you, sir. May I have half-hour's leave, sir? Sure. While you're there, give her my, uh... I'll deliver your message, sir. Steerage passengers, report to the doctor. - The lieutenant got me a year's probation. - I'm awfully glad. He said to say goodbye and everything. I'm going to miss this. Looking for islands, Doc. - Any new governors? - Health A1? Yes, health A1. Hey, wait a minute. She won't be needing you. Give this back to the doctor. Penny, lady? A penny? A penny, mister? Penny, mister? Penny, lady? A penny, lady? A penny, mister? A penny, mister? A penny? A penny? You're a good pal, aren't you, Doc? What do you think? Then how's about buying a pal a drink?
