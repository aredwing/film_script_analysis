So this is 187 and this is Miguel. Do you want me to hug and kiss them too, or shall we get going? Ok, ok. Basically we have a situation... For the past four months a large amount of money... ...has dissapeared from our deposits in the Casino. Now he was stupid enough to get caught on the camera. He used to be like a brother to me and now... Don't worry about that. You are going to meet him before you take good care of him. It is very important that you take out only these two people and no one else. Because will be as well. And want you to kill him in front of my eyes. Meet him, huh? This is getting funnier all the time. Come on Claudio! Don't be such a pussycat! And I want you to kill him in front of my eyes. Ivan! You asked me something. - Patrick, we I... it is so. I have gone through the numbers from the casino. There is something not right. The missing money. There are a lot actually. - Is it money? - Two million! It's out of money. Well, was going to ask you: Have you heard or seen anything? - No, have not seen anything! Ok. It dissolves more secure. It evens itself out. Well, have a friend I want you to meet. This is Claudio Dragonetti, an old friend of mine. We worked together in Kosovo. It was he who taught me the concept, kill first and then talk. He prefers not talk much. Not even swedish. He is more of a man of action. But do not worry. You will meet him at dinner tonight. One could say that he is the world's most dangerous man. Allow me to show. Demonstration! See you tonight at the restaurant. Patrick! I want you to take care of this business. What the hell? Andrea! - It's me. - Hi sweet! You, we have been invited to a restaurant tonight. - Ah, but what fun. - Put on something nice. - But I'm almost finished. - But you. Ivan knows. - Oh, my God, what are you saying! But do not worry about it now. We take it then. I get there as quick as I can. Closing time! - Nice place you've got here. - Mmm, you are not welcome here. - I'm sorry?! - I'm not afraid of you. Stop talking English. What do you want? - I want my money, it's been three days now. And did not get my stuff so then we're even. Price on my head, huh?! You is not fucking worth more. I give you three days and I want my money. Three days or othervise it's goodbye. Pussy! Business as usual. - Yes! - I forgot one thing. - I want you to pick up a package for me. - What package? No big deal. And if they give you any trouble. Just show them who's the boss. Don't worry. Just give me the adress. I will find it some how. Don't worry. See you. Now, let's see this killing machine in action. Yes, that's me. Molle screwed up as usual. Dragonetti! Over here! Over here Dragonetti. We have something for you. Come closer. Come closer Dragonetti.

And what do you do tonight? If you want to live, get out of here. - Do it! - Do what? This wasn't part of the deal Dragonetti. Stay down and I will let you live. Your weapons! At least, I wear protect on. No! Please forgive. Sorry. Knut Mortensen, Danish Radio. We are in Gothenburg. A lot of beautiful tourist town with many fine buildings. And fine restaurants.

I do not want to die. I only want to fuck. I have children at home. - Shhh! It's ok. - Please. Please. Do not kill me. It's ok. It's ok. I hope it was as good for you as it was for me. Peter you are going to shoot me now. But what now? You killed my father. You should get your fucking fafa! I saw nothing. Sorry. Did you get it? Not? What the hell are you doing? You could just shoot me. I explained to you format. Have not you done it? No? When you get home to Copenhagen, you can take and start with fucking children's TV. Turn off the camera. What the hell are you? - Claudio Dragonetti, what a bastard he is. - I told you so. You can not trust him. He has betrayed me. He has betrayed me. I know it. I have warned you of that fucking spaggen. A fucking spagge! Do not understand why you would bring him here from the beginning. He shot my restaurant into pieces and killed innocent people.

There it is. - He has fucked up my restaurant. - Sit down. So we fix this. What a bastard. You are my friend. You can rely on. But Claudio, he was my friend, but now. He has let me down completely. I have an assignment for you. - No problem. - We pick him at the train station. So we drive him out into the room. You get three to four days to do what you want with him. Three to four days? Hehe! You only have one day for me. Mr Dragonetti? Come with us please. Sweet dreams. Et tu Claudio. - Oh, shit. What own me the honour, Ivan? The honour? - This is my place. - Is this your appartment? - This is my city! Oh, yeah? Did you decorate it yourself? - You broke the deal. - I didn't broke it. You broke the fucking deal! - I did my job but you didn't pay. - Headboy! You ordered the job. You didn't pay. It's not the first time, van! It's a very funny thing you've got here. Is this your knife? - It's a little nice knife. - Yeah, do you want it as a souvenir? I'm very sorry Claudio, I hate to say it, but I think this is time to say goodbye. Spiritus Santus Donium. Goobye Claudio! I see you in the next life. Take four hours. Beat him up really good, ok!? Ivan! Next time you want to fuck with me you've got to kiss me first. - There won't be a next time Claudio. - Oh, yeah, there will be. This is the end. This is over. I'm sorry Claudio. Take care. I see you in later... in hell! Are you the fucking sushi chef? I'm fucking talking to you. You've always been a son of a cunt! I say you cut him into small pieces and paint him all over the floor. I want Dragonetti on the ceiling. I want him on the roof. I want him all over the place, I'm fed up with Claudio Dragonetti. Make it happened. Goodbye. Go brush your teeth. You stink. Fuck you! Stand up! What's wrong with you? Do you like music? I love music when I work. Can you stand up? Sorry, hehe. So you want more? Or have you had enough? Dragonetti. Do you want more? Or have you had enough? You know. I like you, but I must do my work. And you still are just a stupid idiot. But you got balls. Do you want me to stick your baseball bat up your asshole now? Fan ta dig Dragonetti! I can not believe how much Dragonetti tolerate. He's not fucking human. - He would have been dead long ago. - I do not care which. - I want him dead! - I go in again. I'll finish this. You understand dead? What the fuck are you doing? This is your last potato. You are my headboy now. Welcome to the family. Take your best shot. You're just getting me bored. What the hell. What, where is he? Where the hell have you done with the Dragonetti? He was here just now. What? Find him. Get the others! - What? Now? - What the hell do you think? Where the hell is he? Where is he? It's a sick joke this. Spread out here to hell! Look for him everywhere. But look for him then! He can not fucking come along way yet. Dragonetti! Go and check out at it! - Mr. 187 I have found traces of blood. - I'm on my way. Yes, I'm looking for Chris. Telephone. Somebody wants you. He has a crappy english. - Hello? - I have a situation here. Come, we have a customer. - Satisfied? - Yes. - The car's outside. - Let's go. You said you got a car. This is a strainer on four wheels. Excuse me. I would like a... Hallo? Please, hello! Excuse me mrs. I would like a fucking room. Please! Thank you. Go change your underwear. Why did you let Claudio escape? I? It was Trent fucking fault. I hit him with the baseball bat in the head several times. Afterwards, while Trent guarded with I went out and called you. And why did you let Trent remain alone in the room with Claudio? Why I thought of that idiot would take care of that. Come with Trent tomorrow to the golf course. Arrived exactly 11:47- Absolutely. Well, we have a party there at room 107. Want to hang out with? Maybe we can have some fun then. I do not want to buy a waccum cleaner. Goodnight. - Tada! - Hmm. Tada! This fucking club slides off. If you have never seen blood before? What? You are here. - I asked you to call me? - Sorry. You asked me to come 11:47. I'm here now. always see you as my friend. Friends. Romans, countrymen. Lend me your ear. We are here today to bury Claudio Dragonetti. What hurts one person will survive. The good will be buried when she dies. It's so with Claudio. This is my city. My Gothenburg! Let's play some golf. - By the way. I have sent for spetsnaz. - What? But can handle it. - You may need some help. They will already tonight. - Tonight? Go home and tidy up. You look like shit. Gentlemen, and a lady. I have a big problem. Money? Money isn't my problem. My problem is bigger than my money. My problem is Claudio Dragonetti. Then you have a big fucking major problem. Now, can you help me? Don't worry about the police. The chief executive is a friend of mine and they won't cause us any trouble. Worry more about Claudio Dragonetti. Now, let's get down to business. I will pay you 1 million euro if you deliver Claudio Dragonetti on a silver plate. But I recommend you to pay caution. Claudio Dragonetti is... He came to my restaurant and killed 30 of my men. Shot the place into pieces. He even killed a pregnant woman. Slicing up her belly. Dragonetti is the kind of guy who only kisses the girl after he stabbs her. I see. Let's go. - Wasn't Dragonetti short and with dark clothes? - Yes, what about it? Then that was our guy. Let's get him. - Mr Wrechik. - Yes. - What's wrong now? - Dragonetti. Chasing Dragonetti, sir. - Is he nearby? - Yes. We blew up his car and wounded him badly. Now, Jurij! Listen to me. I want you take him out. I want to see him dead. Ok, don't fail me. - We are going. Let them handle him. - Let me take care of Dragonetti. - I can handle this. - You had your chance. Shut up and drive the car. Give him a grenade! Elena, go that way. Mikahill, you come with me. Shit! Don't you dare! Don't you leave me here! - Why do you not trust me? - 187, let me say this. You have made a fool of yourself again, Ok! I do not think you can handle him. Think not. If you do not have any confidence in me why do you want to work with me? - Because he is my enemy. - Why do you want to work with me anyway? - He has betrayed me and therefore he deserves death. - Let me get slay him. No worries. You will get a chance. If he comes tomorrow, we must be prepared. I want to take him now! You can't. Won't let you and Jurij into the forsest shooting at each other. It may just be the soup of it all. Someone good order it should be. You need to be so damn narrow-minded? Can not you just trust me? Dragonetti. We will mourn for her later. Let's go find this bastard son of a whore! Fuck! Bloody Dragonetti! Mikahill? Fuck! Your cellphone. Do you want me to call your boyfriend, huh? - Hell of fuckface! Can you hear who this is? - Yes, I can Claudio. Good. Listen to me very carefully. You have fucked me for the last time. I'm going to get you one by one. Just want you know how it sounds when one of your boyfriends dies. Listen carefully and enjoy the show. Put on some ABBA or what the hell. - What a fucking noise. - It's nice with some music. It's relaxing. 187, I think this will fix itself. No problem. What the fuck? All the others are dead. I'm not staying here. Let's go. Shit! What? So you did have the guts to fight me after all? A good russian. Is a dead russian. Dragonetti! Din jve! Dragonetti! You wil die! - Miguel! - Sorry boss. Miguel! I'm going to make soup of you. You know Claudio. Do you remember the good old days? You and me, huh... - The good old days, huh? - We used to be good old friends and... ...no one could stand against us. - Fuck the good old days. Fuck you! - Game on. Any last words?
