He was just an amateur photographer. - They never found his body. - Right. The rescue teams searched the whole area for a week. And nothing. Guy completely vanished. Now, the only thing they found was his camera. Those are his last shots. Let's see. These are some crappy shots. I just want you to focus on the very last picture he took. It's exactly like the drawing in your book. Wow, man. This is a creepy tree. This cannot be a coincidence. And according to my grandfather's manuscript, once we find the tree we will also find the secret burial ground. I just hope it's not a bunch of old skeletons down there. Guys, we're gonna find this tree. All righty. Let's go. Look, I don't mind doing some digging and stuff. Finally get my hands on some cash. Got everything? Yeah. Where's he going? So. This is the river. And this is where the guy was camping. Now, based on the reports, they found his camera a few miles up the river. That means... we're gonna have to cover all this area. And this is where Flipp's gonna build our tent. Right, Flipp? Flipp? Where is he? You hear that? Take your shoes off. Did you grow up in a barn or somethin'? Take your shoes off. Jesus Christ. That's it? Beans? Tell me you're joking. A man can actually live on beans and nothing else. What kind of a man is that? Corned beef? - Flipp, you're a lifesaver. - I don't think so. I'm on a low-carb diet. I thought we agreed to share everything equally. You thought, maybe. Not me. Here you go, Sai. This is for you. Hey! That dog eats better than I do. I'm sorry. Would you like some? - Forget it. - Please. No. I got some doughnuts back in the tent. All right. Flipp, want some beans? No, I'm fine, thanks. Do you want some corned beef? - I'm good, thanks. - All right. Is that your grandfather? Yeah. He had Cherokee blood. He spent his entire life studying the people that lived in these forests. Their secrets, their legends. Rituals. Then, when he passed away, he left me his journal. Who's the girl next to the tree? That's Satinka. She's a ghost. Her fingers are made of little tiny branches. And her soul was cursed by this tree right here. What's funny? Your grandfather was really fucked up, man. I bet he was smokin' some real good shit when he wrote that. You know, there's some really unique stuff in here. That's why I want to get it published. What about the secret burial ground? And your fuckin' treasure? You know what? It's not at all about the money. It's real important to me to honor my grandfather's memory. Cheers to your grandfather. I can't, man. I got a lot of work to do. Sai? Come on, boy. Get out. Please. Sai? Sai. "Once the twig enters the skin, an infection occurs. That's how the spirit marks his victims." Oh, God! What the fuck is that? "The victim will slowly start to get sick... "and will ultimately be paralyzed, as if he were under the effect of a strong venom." Where did you go? This place sucks, man. I want to go home. What happened? Let me see. It's okay, man. It's just a scratch. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Oh, gee. Get on your dancin' shoes You sexy little swine Hey, Flipp! Get your ass out of bed. Go get your dog. Cool shot. Hey, Flipp. Wake up, man. Josh. What? I'm gonna search the left side of the river. And I want you and Flipp to explore the right side. How much digging have we got? According to the legend, the secret burial ground is just below the tree. How deep, I don't know. Why? Got any problems? Me? No. Flipp, yeah. He's my problem. Guy's got a PhD in laziness. Hey, Flipp! Come on, get up. We got work to do. Flipp! Where is he? I don't know. He was down by the river with his dog. All right. I'm gonna go look for him. Flipp! We're not alone. Hey, look what I found. A Datura stramonium. Blooms once in every six years. Let's cut it. Careful. Don't smell it. It causes hallucinations. I know. Back from where I'm from, every kid used to get high on 'shrooms. And then we'd go back to this barn and make out. Come on, let's go. We only have two more to go before we go back. Can I make some tea with this? It's tempting. No. No, thanks. It'll be fun. Easy, girl. That's enough. Here you go. Thank you. Cheers. To a long, hard day. Cheers. That is disgusting. You know, it's a shame we have to leave already. It's so peaceful out here. What? Nothing. Just the tea was a little too hot. That's all. Jennifer? What? There was some girl behind me just now. I even could feel her breathing. Okay, listen. No more tea. Hey, Josh! Just don't fuckin' do that, man. I'm sorry. Any luck? No, man. He's just... Well, he was definitely here this morning. Must have gotten lost on his way back. All right, let's go look for him. Come on. I feel happy. Yeah. Hooray for nature, Jennifer. What's the matter? I saw a girl again. I'm glad you think this is funny. It's not. This is what you get for drinking this shit. Drink some water. You're just dehydrated. We've been out here forever. I think I parked the truck over there. Sit tight, okay? And don't go anywhere. I saw it. Jennifer? I'm gonna go this way. All right. Stop! It's me, Sean! Shit. What the fuck did you bring a gun for? I'm sorry, man. I thought you were that bastard. Look at you, dude. There's some kind of psycho weirdo out there playing a sick game with us, planting traps. They're animal traps. - Must be a hunter. - A hunter? Oh, that's what it is. Nice deduction, Columbo. You want to give me a hand? Fuck. You okay? Kiyomi! Flipp! Come on, we're wasting time. Where the hell are you? Get your ass out here, now! I'm gonna go check this way. Bingo. Hey, I found his dog! Sorry. I guess I was just a little too impulsive. It's my friend. Don't kick him. What happened? You okay? Yeah. I'm sorry. I heard some noises, and he came running through, and... - I just accidentally... - Yeah. This is Jennifer, by the way. - I'm Sean. Hey, I saw you - Hi. And your friend this morning. She can't find her. Lost? Just like we lost our pothead. We'll just go look for them together. - All right? - Let's go. Don't want to lose any more time. Kiyomi! Flipp! It's gonna get dark pretty soon, so... let's just head back to the car. We'll drive to the first village and get some help... get somebody that knows the area. Fuck! Don't look at me. Try now? Nothing. Guys? - Hi. - Hey. Listen, it's starting to get dark. So we decided we're just gonna spend the night in the car. We'll just walk to town in the morning, get some help. Okay. You okay? I'm just a little scared. You think we will find them? We will. Okay. Let's just get some rest. Jennifer? Where's the tree? You. What's in the bag? Conium maculatum. You know, that was actually gonna be my first guess. Right. What is it? Yeah, here. Take a look for yourself. It says here it "contains several alkaloids "that work by depressing the function of the central nervous system, - causing paralysis." - Correct. "Death occurs when the muscles used in breathing become completely immobile." It's a very beautiful and very dangerous flower. Come on, guys. Flowers, death, alkaloids? I'm tryin' to get some sleep here. I thought you were asleep. Just with one eye. I'm gonna take a piss. Hey, man. Careful with our friend out there. Who, Bigfoot? I'm takin' the pit bull. Why don't we just get some rest? Do we know much about it? What exactly is global warming, and what are its precedents? Is global warming today a reality? Is global warming imminent for the future? Jennifer. Where's Josh? I don't know. We should get goin'. I'm gonna go get him, all right? Josh. Kiyomi! Kiyomi, is that you? Fuck! What the fuck? Hey, just relax! What the fuck? It's all right, mate. It's me. Where'd you come from? Up there, man. Thank God you broke my fall. Mind if I ask you what the fuck you were doin' up there? This. Yeah? I finally managed to get some signal. And? And I got through to the park ranger. He's gonna send a chopper, but it's gonna take a few hours. - A chopper? - Yeah, to find Flipp. Thank God. Get back to the car. Sure. Kiyomi! What are you doing down there? You scared the shit out of me. While I was in the car, I thought I saw Kiyomi. So I went down and looked for her, and somebody was chasing me. Where? I don't know. I think he just went down there. - Let me give you a hand. - Okay. Come on, show yourself! Get outta here! Come on, you coward! Feel better now? Yeah. There's a hunter. We actually saw a bunch of animal traps yesterday. He sabotaged the car. Look. She's punishing me for hunting in her woods. I'm sorry. She wants me to prepare you now. If I don't obey her, she's gonna kill me. All right, boys, start the engine. All right, let's go to the nearest town. What are you doing? Wrong way. But we came that way. Trust me. You okay? We have to follow the river down to the valley. Give me the map. She just left her tree. I can feel it. Soon she will come and get you. I saw her once. She whispered something in my ear. She planted her voice inside my head. Stop! One day, her voice told me to stop hunting animals and to start tracking people. She needed my help. People come to the forest. She marks them. I make sure they don't leave... ... until she comes and drags them underground. Out of gas. Nice one, Sean. You knew how much gas we had to get out of here. What the hell's wrong with you, man? Sean? Where are you going? Something's wrong with him. You just noticed? Dj vu. What? I have the strangest feeling I've been here before. I told you we came from the other direction. No, not on this trip. It was another time. You're losin' it, man. Fuck. Shit. It's raided my morning meditation and my yoga... my tent. Josh! About time. Look what I found. Josh, it's the missing tourist's video camera. You gotta see this. - What am I lookin' at? - Hold on. It's me. It's raided my morning meditation and my yoga... my tent. Watch this. What are you showing me? Fuck. Shit. Josh... last night in the car there was somebody else. A girl. Listen. Listen. She touched me, and I felt this pain. And this was in my chest. Right here. Can you hear yourself? Josh, she marked me. It's just like in my grandpa's book. What? You think I'm crazy? No. Okay, somebody tell me what's going on. Be my guest. It's all in here. A Native American legend about a ghost. One in the form of a girl. She's supposed to protect the tree and the forest. And I saw her last night. That's beautiful. Hey! Sean! There's a lake behind that hill. Oh, yeah? Let me guess. Another dj vu? You wouldn't understand. I understand you're not telling me something. Just go east, past the lake. That'll take you out. What, are you staying here? I'm gonna slow you down. What are you talking about? Sean? Let me help you. The spirit marked me. And she's coming back for me. Will you shut up? He's just tryin' to scare you. No, I'm not. Can you pass me my grandfather's journal? "120 years ago... "a Native American girl named Satinka "used to come into the forest... as if gliding on the moonlight." "She was in love with the son of the medicine man. "But their happiness was short-lived. "Pioneers entered the forest that day with the intention of clearing the land for their animals. " We're gonna rush them Injuns out of our land is what we're gonna do. Yeah, we should've done that a long time ago, J.R. We're gonna have ourselves a little Indian barbecue. - Indian barbecue! - What do you think? Mm-hmm, that's right. Let's go, Skinny. - Why don't you start there? - All right. Satinka! Damn! Stay down! Stay still! Don't cry. Oh, yeah. "The spirit of the tree gave protection to Satinka and saved her from the burning forest. " "But it came with a price." "One night, during a rainstorm, "something came out of the trunk. "It was the spirit of the tree that took Satinka's form. It went out to revenge against the enemies of the forest. " People started to get sick and die. And they still do. The spirit brings their bodies down into a secret burial ground. Then he plants 'em like trees. He replaces every burnt tree with a body... the human body. Nice. Romantic, eco-friendly, totally absurd. I believe the real body of Satinka is still inside the tree, controlled by the evil spirit. Come on, you don't really believe this shit, do you? I'm gonna lie down. Now, take a rest. You'll feel better. Josh? I know where the tree is. You're telling me this now? I think my grandfather took me there when I was a kid. Why don't you try forgetting it again? The tree and the rest of this shit. 'Cause come daylight, we're outta here. The trip is over. The tree's waiting for me. Look, I'm gonna go check on Jennifer. Jennifer? Oh, shit. Remember. Where is it? Where is the tree? Where is the tree? A medicine man can go into somebody else's mind to explore his most secret memories. I have to find that tree. We need to get into his mind. You are goin' to help me, and then I'll let you leave. It's all in this book. The witch lives inside of a tree. If I can find that tree, I can cut it down at its roots. Be careful. She marked him. She is already a part of him. The dream catcher will open the door to his dreams. You must sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sean, it's me. You hear me? I need you to tell me where the tree is. Will you take my hand? Talk to me! You have to remember! I'm losing him. I came here before... with my grandfather. We used to come here together, remember? This was our secret place. You loved hiding there next to our tree. Behind the waterfall. In a secret valley. I know where the tree is. Where? It's behind a waterfall. Good. You're going to take me. What about him? It doesn't matter. She's already got him. She's got his mind. You're not like the rest of them. You must go now. I trust you, and you're gonna help me. Remember... we will always be together. Wake up now. Go now. She's gonna tell me what to do. I won't listen to her anymore. I have to stop her voice. No. Go away! Leave the forest! Leave! The spirit of the tree took your mind! Like it took Satinka's! We can stop this! I know how! Go away! Kill... Kill Satinka. Burn the tree. I'm not going to hurt you. I know what you want. The curse is over. You can rest in peace. It's not over. Yes. It was the spirit of the tree that took your soul. And it was using you to avenge the burnt forest. That night I gave my soul to the spirit. I wanted revenge for what they did to us. It was my choice. No. No, that's not true. Yes, my love. I did it for us. Join me, and we will live forever. No. Josh. Oh, God. Sean. Talk to me. Go. Save yourself. Josh. No! Run. My love, I did it for us. ...for us. It's his time now. No. Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA
