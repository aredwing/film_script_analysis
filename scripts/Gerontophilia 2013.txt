Jeanne Manning... Winona Rider, Winona Rider! Those are the real revolutionaries... Oh fuck... -Winona Rider. Shoplifting is always revolutionary. Oh my God... I'd better go. I have to make dinner for Marie. -Okay. -See you tomorrow. -Okay, bye. Did I say Gudrun Ensslin? Marie? Lake? Are you there? Lake? You and your books. Aren't they supposed to be obsolete? What do you want? How was work? Thanks for cleaning up. I xed you something, it's in the fridge, nuke it 3 minutes. Pull him out. This way. I don't want to be a lifeguard. It was my stupid idea in the rst place. -What are you going to do for money? -Everyone is always so worried about money. -I think this is just our gap year anyway. -For me, it's going to be a permanent gap. I'll never be able to afford tuition. -You can always get out of town together. -Are you serious? -Always. Shit... Looking pretty rough, Marie. -Gee, thanks. Hi Desiree! Hi! -How did you get all banged up? -I had a little dispute with a dancer at the club. She wasn't sharing hertips. -What's your degree, I still don't get why you can't nd a better job. -Lake, stop. -It's not that easy, Lake. -Woman in the nigger of the world. What? Yoko Ono. -She's right. Anyway smartie, a gentleman I used to know when I was in college came into the club the other night and offered me a position. -Where? -At an assisted living facility. -You mean an old folks home? Who knows? If things work out, I might even be able to get you a job there. -At an old folks home... Disgusting! You were supposed to be nished bed pans an hour ago. -Sorry, I got involved in a pretty heated game of Chinese checkers. -It's not your job to fraternize with patients. Anyway, your mother wants to see you in the ofce. Now. I have to see Lake and get back to work. -Yeah. -Yeah. Alright... -Hi mom! -Lake, can't you knock rst? -Mom, I didn't know you'd be in a meeting. -I told you not to call me mom at work. Say hello to Mister Nelson. -Hello... -Look, he got me these for the car. Aren't they nice? Hey, how are you getting along at the wrinkle ranch? -The wrinkle ranch, really? -Oh well now son, let's... Let's not get off on the wrong foot. I want all the employees here at Coup de Coeur to feel like part of the family. Can I go now? Who are you? -I'm Lake. I've been asked to give you... To help you clean up. Are you ready for your afternoon medication? Here we go. Oh,that's the way it's going to be. Okay then... open up. You can do this, come on. Come on Mister Peabody, open up. Fine...That's it. Very good. Take the glass of water now. I know... Very good. Very good. Boy, there are bed pans that need to be sterilized. Take your chariot and come with me. Now! -The clarion call of Coup de Coeur. Bed pans... -I'll see you around, M. Peabody. See you where ever you are. What kind of medication is he on? -It's none of your business. -It must be pretty strong, he seems... -M. Peabody is a very sick old man. Are you giving him psychotropic drugs? -Where did you learn that word? In the school yard? Boy, you don't know what you're talking about. Hey! Hey! -You're new. -Yeah. What about you? -I've been here a few months. It's pretty disgusting. Old geezers pissing all over themselves. -It doesn't bother me. Let's be friends. Sure. And then she waved... -Yeah, not bad. -Well I think she's great. -She's alright. So tell me about the old men. -I gave one a sponge bath. -Was it gross? -Not really. Somebody has to do it. -You're amazing. You're always taking care of other people. -What do you mean? -I don't know, you're always picking up after Marie and you like giving old men sponge baths. -I didn't say I liked it. You see what I mean? You're such a saint. -I'm not a saint. Oh my God! That's blood. -What? -The blood of a saint. -I'm not a saint. -But you are. -I'm the revolutionary and you are the saint. -What makes you think you're so revolutionary? You couldn't even make your own list. -Hey, are you okay? -Oh, of course! -Have you heard the show tonight? -Totally! Oh,this is Lake. Hi. -What happened to you? -Oh actually that's nothing. That is just a little bit of stigmata because Lake's an actual saint. -Ah, that's all. -No really, he's like an actual saint. Saint Lake. -Desiree? -Okay I've got to get back to my band. -Okay, see you later. It was nice to meet you. M. Peabody! -M. Peabody! -Come back! M. Peabody! What is he doing? -Oh he's done this before. He says he needs to get to the ocean. He's totally delirious. Tada! -This is denitely better than your Iast job. -No kidding! Naomie Klein is doing a signing here next week and I am in charge of setting it up. -She's on your list? -I cannot believe it. -Are you going to ask Naomie about the cover of No Logo? -What about it? -It's become so iconic, it's like a logo. I wonder how she feels about that. -I don't know, ask her yourself. Desiree, I'd like to show you something. -Okay. -Are you with a customer? -No, actualIy, this gentleman found everything that he was looking for. So... -Excellent. I could really use your help. -Okay, cool. The new Atwood? Get out! She's on my list too. Your list? -Never mind. -It's an advanced copy, I thought you'd like it. -I love it. Um, Desiree, are you busy on Friday night? -Why? Do you want me to pick up a shift? -Um, no I um... I'm asking you over for dinner. Ah yeah. Yeah, I'm free. -Excellent. Great. He's been moved to room 219. His son called and had him upgraded to a private room. -His son? Nobody told me? -Right, next time we'll make sure to consult you rst. What's this game called again? It seems pretty easy. -Beginners always say that. It's called Gin Rummy. -Why is it called that? -Apparently the game's inventor had a preference for gin. And it became known as Movie Star Gin in the 30's, it was the Hollywood elite past time between takes on movies sets with a quick game. -That's really interesting. -When you've been around as long as I have my dear, you learn a thing or two about even the most trivial of pursuits. Gin. -Do you play poker? -I've been known to win a hand or two. We must play sometime. -Are you ready for your afternoon medication? It's time. -We are kind in the middle of something. -If you would just leave them, I promise, I'll take them in a little while. -It's more effective if you take them on schedule. -Like the trains in Germany. -Oh you devil. -Excuse me. Not again M. Abernati! -Don't worry, I'll make sure he takes them. -You're sure? Alright, but don't forget. Give me these pills. We wouldn't want you to have an unfair advantage. -There's a photo in that top drawer, would you hand it to me, please. Look at him. So smooth like the cactus liked off his whiskers. And that's me. I was in rather good shape don't you think? -I guess so. I like the way you look now. When medication are you on? Anas Nin. There's a feminist you don't want to fuck with. She's on my list. -What is this list you're always talking about? -Private joke. Ouh! Alice Monroe. I love Lives of Girls and Women. Margaret Laurence, Jest of God. -What can I say, I love Canadian feminist writers. -So, can I borrow these? -To tell you the truth, I have a thing about lending my books, but you're welcome to come over anytime you want to read. -Seriously. Oh wow! SCUM Manifesto. -First edition. I'm impressed. But... Now, I might have to kill you. -Seriously? -I'm not kidding. Your hair is nice. -Thank you, so is yours. This band sounds like The Pixies. Hut the good part of The Pixies, Kim Deal. Kelley is hotter. -They're both hot. They're on my list. Don't be anal. I have to pee. Don't forget to wash your hands. Hit me. -Not just yet. First we need another tip off. I hope we have enough for Vermouth. -...'muth', dear, 'muth'. Remember just a tad. You don't want to bruise the gin. Old men and gin bruise so easily. M. Peabody, what's going on in there? Are you both out of your minds? -It was his idea. -Great. Pick up your shoes. Let's go. Do you know what your mother would say if she found out about this? -How will she nd out? -What am I going to do with you? Aille, aille, aille get dressed. Let's go. Come on, hurry up. Come on, come on. I really don't know what I'm going to do with you. Sorry, I haven't been around much lately. I've been working a lot. So have I. Are you sure there isn't something else? Lake, tell me. You know that you can talk to me about anything. -Are you sure about that? I think there might be something wrong with me. I think I may have a... A fetish. You mean like leather? -Not that bad. I saw your sketchbook. Is that what you're talking about? Those drawings? Okay, this is like freaking me out a little bit, so um... I have to give the car back to my dad. Do you want me to drop you off? -No, thanks. I think I'll walk. I'm not a saint. What's wrong with you today, boy? l think l broke up with my girlfriend. What was her name again? -Desiree. -Ah yes, Desiree. -Such a poetic name, the desired one. Did I tell you that historically she was the ance... -Of Napolon, yeah, you told me. Would you like to talk about it? -No, that's okay. Melvin, Do you ever think about the future? If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you want to go? -I've always wanted to visit the Pacic ocean again, but maybe that's a little too pie in the sky. At this point, I'd settle for some fresh air. Hey bro. There you go. Okay, that's good. Melvin? I'm going to get you out of here. What did you do to him? Lake, have a drink. What's wrong? -I'm talking about Melvin, Mr. Peabody. You and this old man... ...it's just not right! -I don't know what you're talking about. -You know what I'm talking about. Everybody knows what I'm talking about. It's disgusting. Didn't I raise you right? -Mom, you're drunk, you're imagining things. Don't lie to your mother! Of course I'm drunk. My son is fucking an 80 year old man! -Mom, what's disgusting is how those old men are being treated. It's like Night of the Living Dead in that place. -Don't make excuses about what you're doing. And don't walk away while I'm talking to you. Lake, open the door! Lake, open the door now. -Where are you going? -For a drive. -Not with my car, you're not. Give me the keys. Give me my goddamn keys! -You mean these? Mom! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Forget about those,they're the worst car accessory. You're taking away my dice. I love those dice. -We're not going to have anything from Mr. Nelson in the car. Thanks Desiree. I owe you big time. -Is Marie okay? -She'll live. Okay Melvin. -Lake, this is crazy. -Can you help me? His arm, his arm's on me, okay. -The other arm, Melvin. Come on, the other arm. Okay. I'm going to go and check if we can get through. All clear. This doesn't really feel like breaking out. It's too easy. Shit... Who was that? -That's a saint. Okay Oh... God! Okay. You got him? Where are you taking him? -He said he wants to see the Pacic ocean again and something about a pie in the sky. -In this beater you're taking him. -I just have to get him out of here. It's like horror hospital in there, so... It doesn't matter where we are. -Are you sure that's where you're going? -Why else would I be doing it? -Okay, I've been thinking about this a lot since the last time I saw you. What I wanted to tell you is um... I think that what you are doing and what you are is really brave. And the fact that you're acting on it, you know, like it's revolutionary. All these ideas that people have about like aging and beauty and what makes somebody desirable, you're going against that. You're ghting against nature. And do you see how radical that is? And what I also wanted to tell you is that... If you were a girl, You'd be on my list. -Desiree... -But the fucked up part is that what you are means that we can't be together anymore. You know that right? I don't know what I am. My God, I wish we were the ones escaping. I'll text you. Okay, go. Go. I love you. Hey! Did you have any more roommates after that? -Here and there. I was even married once. If you can believe that. -Married? To a woman? -At the time it was the only option. It was the 70's. Even in the theater world, if you weren't married after the age of 40, there was something wrong with you. Were you in love with her? -It was a kind of love. Miraculously, we even conceived one drunken winter's night. Two years after our son was born, she divorced me and took him away to another city. From that point on, I was a conrmed bachelor. Good afternoon, young lady, I wonder if you could direct me to the notions department. -Notions, what's that? -My apologies, sowing kits, needles, threads, that sort of thing. I'm afraid I've Iost a button on my jacket. -Yeah, it's down isle 4, at the end on the bottom. -Ah, thank you. This is my grandson. We're travelling across the country together. -He's your grandson? -Yes. Although some days, I really wish he weren't. He's quite the locker, isn't he? Well, I'll be right back. You two, stay out of trouble. -Such a cute old man. My own grandpa's mean as a snake. My parents put him into some retirement home, Sunny Valley or something. I don't blame them though, in his case elder abuse would be entirely justied. Um, I need a map of Canada. -Sure thing. It's cute that you're travelling with your grandpa. Where are you guys headed? -We haven't really decided. -Are you staying in Ontario? -Yeah. -Maybe I can help you. When I was a kid, my family and I used to go rent a cottage around here. It's really pretty, there are a lot of lakes. -Are there a lot of people... -Would you mind paying for this dear boy, I left my wallet in the car and don't forget I'll have cigarettes. Any brand. One of the few advantages of being old: invisibility. -You're crazy. Am I? -We have to start planning for the future. Money isn't going to hold out forever. Sun block? -Who knows, we might end up in Palm Springs. -I already told you, I like your wrinkles. I'm going to keep this. If people only knew how you treat me. What did he want? -That boy? He saw the map and he wanted to know if l needed directions. So, we're here and we're trying to get to... Here. To be honest, I'm not sure I'm up for such a long trip so soon after Coup de Coeur. That place really took the vinegar out of me. -What are you saying? -What I'm saying is perhaps we should rest for a few days before pressing on. You haven't been telling anyone about us, have you? -Don't be silly, they would never understand. -What about your son? -I wouldn't worry about my son. He paid for the home, but he hasn't been in touch for many years. He hasn't introduced me to my own grandchildren. He never really got used to the idea of having an old queen like me for a father. It always embarrassed him. What were you talking to that guy about? -What guy? -At the dinner. You seemed to be talking a lot. -I already told you, directions. -And why were you laughing? -I suppose I made a joke, you know how I am. -It must have been pretty funny then I guess. -What are you harping on this? Don't tell me you're jealous. Jealous of an old sack of bones like me? -Because I asked you to be careful about what you say to people. Learn to keep your mouth shut in public and I don't have to be this way. -I'd never thought I'd live to see the day... -I'm going for a walk. Are you coming? You look very nice tonight. -I'll have you know I was quite the snappy dresser in my day. Two gin and tonics, please. -I need to see some ID, love. Oh dear, I may have left my wallet back in my room. -Are you serious? -He's 81. -Not my rule. Everybody has to have ID. -Here it is. Looks like you drinking for free tonight. -What do you mean? -It's his birthday. He's 82 years young. -Let me see that. Why didn't you tell me? -I don't know, I already feel like enough of a fossil. I've never been one much for celebrating birthdays. -What about you? -I love birthdays. -No, man I need to see your ID. -Oh sorry. I must have left it in the car. I'll be right back. Gin and tonic, love, happy birthday. I heard it's your birthday. Cheers. How old are you anyway? This is my seat. Can you hold this for me, please? Fucking hell! -That's enough! That was supposed to be for you. -I gathered that. Happy birthday, Melvin. That time of year thou mayst in me behold, When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang upon those boughs which shake against the cold, bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. In me thou seest the twilight of such day, As after sunset fadeth in the west, which by and by black night doth take away, death's second self, that seals up all in rest. You know, I have been thinking about you said before and it's not just about the sex. I really think I'm in love with you. I know it sounds crazy, but... That's how I feel. Did you hear what I said? Melvin? Melvin? Melvin! Melvin... That was a nice service. -5 people, including the organist. -Yeah,that was sad. It's nice that his son came. -I thought Marie was going to start making out with him in front of the casket. -I love Marie. -You know, if those two get together, that kind of makes Melvin my grandfather. I mean retroactively. So you're okay? -I guess so. Oh, I forgot. Revolutionary... -I got you one too. -What? -Okay. No... Desiree. I love it. -It's perfect. I'll text you, okay? -Okay. Bye. -Bye. Hi! I'm Lake. -Hi young man! -Are you here everyday? -Most week days. -Maybe I'll see you around.
