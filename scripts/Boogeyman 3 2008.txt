The patients are beginning to speak of a presence in the clinic. Something they can feel. Something I can feel. Something I don't dare admit I've felt before. While I continue to explain away the Boogeyman's existence... ...as nothing but the darkness within ourselves... ...I'm left to wonder... ...does that make him anything less than real? Layla, no. It's time for bed. Layla? Layla, are you okay? What's wrong, girl? Did you hurt yourself? And we're back. You're listening to Headspace on WZXB... ...Wolfbridge University radio. I'm Sarah Morris and as always, I'm here with Dr. Roger Kane... ...psychiatrist and head of Wolfbridge's Psychology Department. And we've got Liam on the line. Liam, how can we help you? Yeah, this is a question for Sarah. Fire away, Liam. I listen to your show every night. You have a really sexy voice. Really. What exactly is your question? So, what do you say, Sarah? Can I take you out sometime? Sorry, Liam, my boyfriend is understanding, but not that understanding. So I guess a blowjob's completely out of the question? Not necessarily. Just bend down as far as you can, open up wide... ...and give it your best shot. Our next call is from Eric. Eric, how are you tonight? Okay, I guess. Actually, not so good. My girlfriend broke up with me last week... ...and I've been having a hard time dealing with it. Sounds like you really cared about her. Yeah, I still do. I think it was all my fault. Well, I'm a freshman and I haven't made that many friends. I guess I just need someone to talk to. Well, that's why we're here, Eric. Fire away. Hey, you still here? Hi. Just putting the finishing touches... ...on my ultimate breakup CD. You know, one of the cry-in-your-beer... ...women-are-nothing-but-cray manipulative-bitches variety. For that last caller? I had Brandon get his info before he hung up. - Sarah... - I know. I just... He seemed so sad. You know, he was blaming himself for everything he's going through... ...and I knew what that feels like. I'm proud of you. What you've overcome this past year... It's gonna make you a great psychiatrist one day. I don't need to explain... ...why a psychiatrist should never hand-deliver a sappy mix CD... ...to a broken-hearted patient's bedroom, do I? It's a good thing I'm not a psychiatrist yet. I'm serious. Never underestimate the influence... ...your words and actions have on others. - Okay. - See you. Bye. Thank you very much. This is more than a spoonful. This is like a Mama Jug, huh, right? - Well, hello sweet cheeks. - Don't touch my tits. That's the property of Alpha Sigma Theta. Did you see that guy? I'm telling you, guys, I fucking aced my poetry final this morning. - Poetry? Seriously? - Yeah, man. My professor says I'm the next rock poet in the making. My very own Jim Morrison. Who? What do you got there, Lukas? It looks like... I don't know. Grilled shit on a bun? People actually get paid to make this shit. - Should have went to culinary school. - You're killing in bong hits and games. You might as well stick to that. Did you talk to your dad about winter break yet? Yeah, I told him I was going home with you and he's fine with it. Really? That is so awesome. My family's gonna love you so much. So has anyone heard from Audrey? I left a message on her cell, I just haven't heard back yet. Wow, the murders are all over the news. It's... - I didn't realie her dad was a big deal. - He's huge. He's been published in every major Psych journal. Maybe I should try her cell again. Maybe you should give her some time. She may not wanna talk about it yet. Yeah, I know. I'm just worried about her. Jeremy, Jeremy, little bit of vitamin C? That's my tiggity. I look so stupid without the one. All right, well, ta-ta. - Later, Ben. - Did you see him? I'm never taking a shower again. - You showered in your bikini? - Yeah. Some perv fraternity is making their pledges install webcams... ...in the girls' showers. - Yeah. - Oh, come on. - I hear that story twice a semester. - No. A girl in my theater class told me that it happened to... It happened to, like, one of her friends in another dorm. Hearsay. There's no way that that's true. Well, I'm not taking any chances. I'm not ending up on the Internet like last time. Your dad left another message. Yeah, I got it. He thinks you're coming home for the holidays. I'll call him. Just as soon as this term paper is out of the way. - How's it coming? - Oh, so incredibly slow. - Yeah? - Yeah, at this rate, I'll be up all night. Oh, okay. Well, in that case... ...I am going to Jeremy's room. - I will see you in the morning. - Oh, have some sex for me. Oh, you know I will. Oh, yeah. That's so unfair. Bye. Lindsay? Audrey? What's going on? Oh, my God, are you okay? Hey. He's trying to kill me. Who's trying to kill you? The Boogeyman. He killed my dad and now he's trying to kill me too. I'm sorry, Sarah. I didn't know where else to go. Audrey, the Boogeyman didn't kill your dad. He did. I've seen him. He's everywhere. I thought I got away... ...but he keeps following me. Sarah... ...I don't wanna die. You're not gonna die. Come here. Hey... ...I'm gonna help you through this, I promise. You're gonna sleep here tonight, okay? It doesn't matter where I sleep. He'll still find me. Where are you going? I'm just going to get some water, okay? Lt'll just take a minute. Just try and go back to sleep. I'll be right back. Sarah? Sarah? Are you in here? Help! Somebody open the door! Open this door! Audrey, what's wrong? We have to go. Now. He's in here. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. There's nobody in here. Look. Look, everything is gonna be okay. Stop saying that, Sarah. Everything is not gonna be okay. Wait. Audrey. Audrey, wait. Audrey. He tried to get me. Audrey... Audrey, what happened? Nothing. Just go away. Oh, please open the door and talk to me. Audrey? Ben. Hey, is David here? Hey, morning. - So you finally cut his tongue out? - Yeah. Hell week. He can't talk to anyone but his pledge brothers. Oh, so the Greek system truly does provide community service. Bye. - You look stressed. - Audrey's back. She thinks the Boogeyman killed her dad. - What? - She's convinced he wants to kill her. Will you check in on her and make sure she's okay? - I've got finals and the radio show. - Oh, yeah, no, of course. Thanks. I left a note for Lindsay. Gotta go, I'm late. Well, hey... ...are you okay? Fine. I promise. And we're ready for our next caller. Hi, you're on with Sarah and Dr. Kane. Caller, do you have a question? Hi. I'm being stalked. - It's Audrey. - He won't leave me alone. I don't know what else to do. He just follows me everywhere I go. Is he a friend, a boyfriend? I'm afraid we need to know about your situation fully... ...in order to help you. You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Why wouldn't we believe you? Because you don't believe in the Boogeyman. What exactly do you mean by the Boogeyman? He killed my dad... ...and those other people. I'm next. Your father was one of those killed at the Hillridge Clinic. I'm very sorry. You must be experiencing a great deal of pain. Look, I know you don't believe me... ...but you will. Once I'm dead, you'll know I was right. Call campus security and get someone over to Hammonds Hall. - Which room? - 403. Her name is Audrey Allen. Tell them she may be suicidal. Sarah? Sarah? Hello? Let's begin by clarifying a few things. I understand your father was killed... ...by a man who thought he was the Boogeyman. No. No. Look, it was him. I've tried to tell Sarah but she won't listen. I wouldn't believe me either but it's the truth. He's real. I don't know what to do. You do realize the Boogeyman is a legend? One that a very sick man used as an excuse to hurt your father... ...but a legend nonetheless. I found my dad's journal. Look, he knew the Boogeyman was real. He knew he was gonna die. Look, my dad was trying to help those people before they all... Hello, caller? Are you there? Caller, are you there? Hello? Yeah. I'm still here. Hello, caller? Are you there? Hello? - What's going on? - Someone's attacking Audrey. - What? - He's strangling her. Jesus Christ. Look, stay here. Stay here. I'll call the police. You sure you're gonna be okay? All right, if we need anything else, we'll call you. Did you tell them what you saw? Sarah, are you all right? What happened? I heard someone say that Audrey... That she... It's not true, is it? She hung herself with a belt. Jee. I think I'm getting sick again. You feel fine to me. No, I mean sick. Sick the way I was last year. I saw something in Audrey's room. Something that wasn't really there. What did you see? If you don't wanna talk about it... I saw someone standing over Audrey like they had strangled her. Who was it? I don't know. Sarah, you were in shock. You witnessed one of your best friends die tonight. - It's probably... - It's the same way my mom died. What if it triggered something? Something that I thought wasn't there anymore? No. Sarah, listen to me. After what you've been through tonight... ...you could tell me you saw a herd of pink elephants... ...in Audrey's room and I'd still think you're the sanest girl I know. Hello? Hey. Katie... ...hey. Sorry, I'm a little jumpy this morning. I think we all are. They asked me to pack up Audrey's things. - Already? - Yeah, dorms close in 48 hours. You two were pretty close, huh? Yeah, we were. Hey, where should I send her stuff? The only contact listed was her dad. He was all she had left. Well, if there's anything of hers that you'd like to keep... Yeah, I think there is. Thanks, Katie. He ain't here. - Where is he? - Study group. Sarah, by the way, I'm really sorry about your friend. A bunch of us were listening to your show when she called in. It was pretty freaky shit. If there's anything I can do... - Thanks. Tell David I stopped by. - Yeah, sure. I just can't stop thinking about it, man. She said someone strangled her. Yeah, well, she was confused. I'm just saying it's fucking freaky. So am I helping you pack your clothes... ...or am I simply packing them? - Come in. - Come in. Careful. I got high just walking down the hallway. Everything okay? I found something in Audrey's room. Her dad's private journal. Audrey was right about her dad. He did believe the Boogeyman was real. He thought he was some kind of physical manifestation of our fears. Well, you said he was a respected psychologist. He never told anyone what he wrote in the journal. He was afraid his patients would suffer for it. More like his career. His theory was that his patients were susceptible to the Boogeyman... ...because they believed in him. When you said Audrey was strangled... ...who did you think...? - I mean, you didn't... - Let's change the subject, okay? I just can't believe her nutjob dad was in charge of helping those patients. It's strange. Even though his theories are illogical... ...he doesn't come off like a raving lunatic in the journal. He articulates his thoughts clearly. Come on, Sarah. I mean, if you believe a word of what was in that journal... ...you're as cray as he was. What? That's not what I said. Shit, sorry. - I just meant that... - Don't worry about it. It's cool. You're almost all done packing. I've just been procrastinating. I should probably get started. Right this second? Stick around. That's okay. I'll see you guys later. Hello? Earth to Captain Oblivious? - It came out the wrong way. - Yeah. You have one new message. Sarah, it's your dad. You're probably busy with finals... ...but I was wondering when you were planning on coming home. I haven't seen you since the funeral... ...and well, anyway... ...I can't wait to see you. Bye, sweetie. To delete this message, press seven. Damn it. Hey, what happened? I just had a fight with the window shade. You kick its ass? No, the other way around. That's all right. - Thanks. - Yeah. I thought you guys were packing. Yeah, I was packing. Now we're taking a break... ...and you are coming to grab a bite with us. I'm not feeling so well so I think I'm just gonna go to bed. Bed? There's no bed in finals week. - I didn't get much sleep last night. - Yeah, who did? Hey, come on. You know, it might do us some good to get out of here. You guys go ahead. Seriously. - Come on. - Okay. See you later. Okay, have fun. Lighter, check. Bong, check. Ignite. Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Oh, shit. I gotta stop smoking. I gotta stop smoking. I gotta stop smoking. I gotta go to rehab. I gotta do something. I gotta stop. Hello? Lukas? Lukas. What the hell is going on? Lukas, answer me. What happened to you? Sarah, hey. Whoa, whoa, what happened? We have to find Lukas. He's hurt. Lukas? How did he get hurt? I don't... I saw him in the kitchen. He was bleeding. He had glass in his mouth. Glass? Sarah, are you sure there was glass in his mouth? Yes, but everything was different. - Different? How were things different? - Hey, what are you guys doing? - Have you seen Lukas? - Lukas? No, we've been at dinner. - Why? What's wrong? - Can you help me find him? - Can we look in your room? - Sure. Come on. He's not here. He's probably just out studying somewhere. Yeah, or getting smashed. Why are you so worried about Lukas? I saw him in the kitchen with blood and glass pouring out of his mouth. - Well, are you sure it was Lukas? - Yes, I'm positive. Well, I'll call his mobile. Did he say anything? Tell you what happened? No, he tried to talk but he couldn't. And then somebody grabbed me... Wait. Who grabbed you? Lukas... ...it's Jeremy. Look, man, give me a ring when you get this, yeah? - Voice mail. - Sarah, who grabbed you? It was the same person I saw in Audrey's room last night. You mean... ...the Boogeyman? I know how it sounds. I do. But... Sarah. It sounds like you had a horrible fucking nightmare. I've had dreams like that before. I mean, they're so real, they're freaky. This was different. Sarah, you're probably just exhausted... ...and everything will seem clearer to you in the morning. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. Sarah, wait. - Hey. - Hey. Yeah, I'm gonna stay with her tonight. Yeah, good idea. - Let me know if you hear from Lukas. - Yeah. Okay. Bye. I can only come up with one logical explanation. - It's happening again. - What do you mean? Me seeing things that aren't there. You know... ...maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing... ...if you went home for the holidays. This has nothing to do with where I spend the holidays. Okay, look. Yeah, it's been a fucking rough 24 hours... ...but that's all this means. Two days from now, you're gonna be away... ...from everything that's happened here. Relaxing. I know. Don't worry about this. You're fine. I know you are. Fuck. Jeremy. Hello? Is someone there? Lukas? Is that you? Hey, where are you going, man? Lukas? Lukas? What the fuck? Lukas, mate. Shit. What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Help! Help! That's the worst sound in the world. Lindsay, where's your cell phone? Hey, Jeremy never called. Do you think that means he didn't hear from Lukas? Or it was late when he did. Jeremy? Lukas? Hey, it's me. Leave a word, mate. Well, everyone deals with stress in different ways. Some people completely lose interest in sex, while others... Not my boyfriend. He says sex is the only way he can relieve stress. If it's affecting your studies... ...you need to tell him there are other ways... What if he doesn't understand? Sarah, what do you think I should do? Hello? Hello? Just be open and honest with your boyfriend. And if he disregards your concerns... ...then there's a much larger problem with your relationship. That's what I was afraid of. Okay, well, thanks for the advice. That's what we're here for, right, Sarah? That's right. Finals week is stressful so we're doing extra shows this week to help you out. Great. Thank you for listening. We'll be right back. Sorry. It's okay. It's all right. - Wanna take a breather? - Yeah. Come on. Let's take a break. - Yeah. - They're around somewhere. Yeah, I know. But, Linds, will you just check in on them? Make sure they're okay. I'm just getting worried. - Yeah, of course I will. - Thanks. I gotta go. I'll call you back. I'm sorry. I know I've been distracted. A couple of my friends are missing and I've... I've been seeing things again. What kind of things? The night Audrey died was the first time I saw the Boogeyman. - Sarah... - I know what you're gonna say. This is not about the Boogeyman. Audrey dying the same way my mom died, I know. This is about your guilt. It's always been about the guilt. You blame yourself for not preventing your mother's suicide. You think I blame myself for Audrey too? A lot of those guilty feelings came bubbling back up to the surface. What do you think? I wish I'd taken Audrey more seriously. By believing in the Boogeyman? Validating her fear by making it your own? Sarah, you're not afraid of the Boogeyman. You're afraid of the guilt. Of what it's capable of. Guilt that you've never completely come to terms with. So I'm going cray because I'm afraid of going cray? - That's what you're saying? - You're not cray. Either I'm cray or the Boogeyman is real. And right now, I don't know which one is worse. They're the same fear. Sarah, once you face it... ...you'll find that neither of those things will bother you anymore. This is ridiculous. Oh, my God. I don't believe in you. You don't exist. I don't believe in you. You don't exist. I don't believe in you. You don't exist. I don't believe in you. You don't fucking exist. Great. You really are going cray. Oh, my God. Jeremy? Help me. Help me, please. - Help me. - Tell me what to do. Get me out. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna find some help. I'm gonna get you out, you hear me? No, don't leave me. No. Sarah. Sarah. Are you okay? Hey. Come here. Come here. Come here, Sarah. Are you okay? Come here. My God, what happened? How did...? How did I get...? You were under your bed. I heard you screaming. Oh, Jesus, Sarah, you're bleeding. - That's not my blood. - What? Whose blood is it? - That's Jeremy's blood. - Jeremy? How did...? That's where he grabbed me. That means he's real. David... ...that means the Boogeyman is real. No, no, come here. Come here. - What's up, man? - Hey. See, Sarah? There's no blood. It didn't actually happen. No dead bodies. But I saw them. I recognied their faces. They're the people who live in this dorm. Yeah, it was the Boogeyman. I heard it on the radio. That's why she killed herself. Do you know what else is weird? I heard that Jeremy and Lukas are missing. - Did you hear what they said? - Yeah. Listen, everyone on campus listens to your radio show. People are bound to start talking. It doesn't mean a... Are you okay? It looked like someone was up there watching me. - I don't see anything. - There was something up there. - See? They're starting to believe. - You don't know... Which is what happened to the patients at the Hillridge Clinic. - They started to believe... - What happened at Hillridge... ...won't happen here because everyone is leaving tomorrow. The dorms close tomorrow at noon, right? Oh, my God, the suitcases all over the hallway. It's gonna happen tomorrow when everyone's leaving. Sarah. I think... ...maybe you should just spend winter break with your dad. Are you serious? Yeah. He called earlier and he said he hadn't talked to you in months. Why'd you lie to me? I'm sorry. I was gonna tell him. I just... You don't want me to come home with you? I just don't want you to use me as an excuse. I mean, you haven't been home... ...since your mom died. Maybe it'd be good for you. Good for me? What does that mean? It's disgusting. Ben, what's up? All right, let's go. I'm just saying it's okay if you're not completely over it... ...just as long as you're still trying to deal with it. Is that a blueprint of the women's restroom? It's true? You're gonna put a webcam... ...in the women's restroom for your fraternity? That is so sketchy. Yeah, well, if I don't, I stay a pledge next semester. Have you any idea what I've been through? The humiliation? There is no way I'm going through that shit again. Some guy was supposed to do it, but he never came back. Probably got caught, fucking idiot. I will give you 50 bucks to do it for me. - I hope you're kidding. - No. You can walk into the bathroom. I have to crawl through the fucking heating ducts. I don't think that's a good idea. Me either. That's why you should do it for me. - No, Ben, I'm serious. I saw... - What? I saw blood coming out of those vents. Blood. Oh, man. Is this about the Boogeyman? Because that's what everyone in the cafeteria was talking about. See? That's what I'm talking about. - Everyone's talking about it because... - Because it's fucking creepy. No, it's completely irrational. - I'm just trying to help you, Sarah. - I appreciate your help. Where are you going? Haven't you heard? I'm going cray. I feel really shitty. The patients are beginning to speak of a presence in the clinic. Something they can feel. Something I can feel. Something I don't dare admit I've felt before. While I continue to explain away the Boogeyman's existence... ...as nothing but the darkness within ourselves... ...I'm left to wonder: Does that make him anything less than real? Come on, man, let's find those girls. You missed your Behavioral Genetics final. Dr. Kane, I'm sorry. I had something important I had to take care of. More important than passing my class? "Sociology of Modern Oral Legends. " Thinking about changing your major? I found this article in Dr. Allen's journal. He was trying to find a way to stop the Boogeyman. We've talked about this. The Boogeyman is not real. He is a legend. According to this article... ...a legend lives or dies based on its social relevancy. A legend is a fictional story, Sarah. Not a living, breathing entity. You do realie that? Sarah, indulge me. Why do we create legends, from a psychological point of view? We create legends as parables. Stories to help us understand the world we live in. All right. Okay. This is the most fun I've had in years. So, what does that say about the Boogeyman? It says we're trying to define evil by giving it a face and a name. Yes. And as long as there is evil in this world... ...the Boogeyman remains socially relevant. - That's all it's saying. - No. It's saying that the legend survives... ...because the person retelling the story believes it. But you're taking that completely out of context. Don't you see? The Hillridge Clinic murders... ...they make the legend real. It's as if the legend has a life of its own. Oh, yeah. Oh, hello, baby. Oh, what do you want? Yeah, that's right. Let me introduce you... ...to my one-eyed friend. Did you hear anything? Up there. You guys, you guys, this is creepy. What was that? What was that? There was an incident last year. A man named Tim Jensen... ...blamed his murders on the Boogeyman. - What does that have to do with this? - Both stories are different variations... ...of the same legend. Usually, when a person retells the legend... ...they change it to fit society's needs. But in this case... Wait, wait, wait. Listen to what you're saying. - A legend cannot modify itself. - This one can. To some people, the Boogeyman is Tim Jensen. To other people, it's Henry Porter. But it's the original legend that gains its strength... ...every time it's reborn. So you missed my final... ...because you were trying to stop a legend from perpetuating itself. You understand why that worries me? I'm running out of time. Wait a minute, Sarah. Sarah? What the...? Blood. Oh, fuck. What are you saying? Every time someone buys this crap... ...the Boogeyman gets stronger? - It keeps the legend alive. It keeps him alive. David, it's about to happen here. In this dorm. The legend is about to be reborn. - What did I miss? - Did you talk to Jeremy or Lukas? No. And I've looked everywhere. - See? It's happening. - Well, Jeremy did have finals all day. They probably went out to celebrate after. Without calling you? I'm not saying he won't be punished. I just... I don't think he was killed by some mythological creature. Come on, Lindsay. What was the longest Jeremy's ever gone without calling you? An hour? Sarah... ...you're my best friend and I love you... ...but if you honestly think... ...that everyone in our dorm is gonna die... ...why aren't you leaving? Because I can't do that. I can't just walk away and let everyone... - I have to get them out of here. - Sarah, this is ridiculous. You're not going to convince an entire dorm full of people to just leave. This is DJ Def Jeff... ...and you're listening to WZXB radio. I'll be with you all night long... ...keeping the energy alive... ...so all those can stay awake. Listen to this. What the hell...? Hi. You're not even supposed to be here tonight. What are you doing? Attention. All students living in Hammonds Hall... ...this is Sarah Morris with an emergency announcement. Shit. Campus security has issued an emergency request... ...for all students to evacuate... ...Hammonds Hall immediately. Take your belongings and stay with a friend. Anyone not in Hammonds Hall. I repeat. This is an emergency announcement... ...for students of Hammonds Hall to evacuate immediately. Take your belongings with you. Several students are already missing. - It's dangerous for anyone to remain... - You're listening to WZXB Radio. Up next, DJ Def Jeff and the smooth grooves. - What the hell are you doing? - I'm calling campus security. They haven't made any announcement. Sarah Morris? - Are you Sarah Morris? - Yes, but listen to me. - I can explain. - I'm sure. Please. There is a journal in my room, that will... David. - Hey, back off. - Just tell me where you're taking her. Go back to your dorm, she'll call you when she's done. - Don't go back to the dorm. Promise. - Get in the car. Back off. Please, David. David, don't go back. David. Hey, David. Is Sarah with you? No, they took her to the security office. Security office? Why? - Long story. - Is she okay? Yeah, but they won't let me see her. Did you hear from Jeremy? No, I still haven't heard from Jeremy or Lukas. - I'm starting to wonder if... - What? Maybe Sarah was right. Yeah, I'm packing up my stuff and getting out of here. - Try not to worry. - Okay. Well, just keep me posted. - Bye. - Bye. Help! Somebody help me! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Oh, come on. Is this totally necessary? I mean, it's a little bit extreme keeping her locked in a cell on her own. She's claiming everyone in her dorm is going to die. Dr. Kane. All right. - What are you doing here? - Sarah. You have half the student body in a total panic for nothing. My friends are dead. I saw them. There was blood all over the hallway. - And then... - Sarah. You're relapsing to the time of your mother's death. You have to let go. - Sarah, it is not your fault. - I know it's not my fault. This has nothing to do with how my mother died. Please. I just... I know something horrible is gonna happen. Why hasn't anyone else seen this blood? Because it is in your head. - Campus security. - I just found some girl's body. She's inside the... God, there's blood everywhere. Hey, calm down. Where are you calling from? I'm in the laundry room in Hammonds Hall. Okay, stay where you are. I'm gonna call the police and I'm on my way over there right now. A student's body's been found in Hammonds Hall. I gotta go. Come on. No, it's okay. I'll take care of her. All right. See? I was telling you the truth. - It's him. - That's not what this means. You can't honestly believe that this was a coincidence. Please. If we don't do something they're gonna find more bodies in that dorm. Just... You have to believe me. Oh, my God. You do believe me. That is not what you think it is. No. Wait, Dr. Kane. Don't go in there. See? Absolutely nothing to worry about. Dr. Kane. Sarah, get the keys. Get the keys. There. On the desk, Sarah. Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, God. - I don't know which one it is. - Try them one at a time. Hurry. - Oh, my God. - For God's sake, Sarah, hurry. Oh, my God. Kane! No. I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you... He used me. - Sarah. - David. David, I figured it out. It's all my fault. Sarah, slow down. Where are you? He wanted me to see Audrey die. He wanted me to tell people about it. He used me. He used me to convince everyone he was real. Sarah, you were right. You were right. I'm so sorry I didn't believe you. Tell me where to take the journal and I'll be right there. Wait, where are you? - I'm in your room. - You're still in the dorm. David, you have to get out of there. David. David. David, you have to get out of the dorm now. David. David. David... Go around back. You heard him. Go around back. I'm not kidding, there was someone hiding under my bed. I swear to God there was. Oh, David. David, what's wrong? David, please talk to me. David, come on, let's go. Let's just get out of here. You were right. The Boogeyman is real. No! - Sarah, help me. - No! - You son of a bitch! - Please. Don't let go. Don't let go. - No. - No. No! No! David. Let him go. No! Oh, my God. Sarah, what's going on? What the hell happened here? Sarah, tell them. Tell them about the Boogeyman. He's real, isn't he? Oh, my. It was me. - I killed him. - No. I killed all of them. There's no such thing as the Boogeyman. It was me. Start evacuating the building. Come on. Everybody out of here. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Put your hands behind your back. - Cut the string. - Let's go. So how'd you do it? How'd you get your boyfriend into all those pieces? You don't expect us to believe you actually ripped him apart, do you? It was me. I did it. Okay. We have to get out of here. This is Officer Young. The elevator seems to be stuck between the first and second floors. Requesting immediate assistance. Say again, Officer Young. You're breaking up. We have to get out of here right now. Just calm down. They'll get us in a second. This is Officer Young requesting assistance. The elevator is stuck between the first and the second floors. We need... This is DJ Def Jeff... ...the voice of Woodbridge University's radio WZXB. I hope all of you freshman listeners... ...managed to survive the first week of classes. Here we go. Campus radio sucks. Jennifer, did you hear me? I'm trying to study. Nobody studies the first week of classes. You're cray. So was the last girl who lived here. What are you talking about? That girl. The one who thought the Boogeyman was killing everyone. The RA told me this was her room. - You're so full of shit. - I'm serious. It all happened in our building. Seriously? They just changed the name... ...so no one would be scared to live here. After all, who wants to live in a building... ...where they found bodies in the heating vents? What's wrong, are you scared? I'm annoyed. I'm going to the library. Where it's quiet. Come on, I was just kidding around. I'll be quiet. I will see you in the morning. Seriously, I'll be quiet. You don't wanna be in here alone, do you? Don't be ridiculous. Hey, Amy. Don't let the Boogeyman get you. Whatever. Changed your mind, huh? Too scared to walk to the library alone? Jennifer, you're hilarious. Wait. It's not Jennifer. Who could it be? No. Is it the Boogeyman? All right, I admit it. I was scared, okay?
