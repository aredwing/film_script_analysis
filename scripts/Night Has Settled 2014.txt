SO HE KNEW WHEN HE PASSED THE HARNESS TO THE MAN NEXT TO HIM, THAT HE WOULD DIE. DO YOU WANT TO LIGH A CANDLE FOR AIDA? SO, YOU SEE, THE MOST IMAGINATIVE AC IS TO PUT ANOTHER PERSON BEFORE YOU, TO GIVE LOVE WITHOU EXPECTING TO RECEIVE IT. AND IN THIS SELF-CENTERED WORLD, IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE AND TO SHARE. THAT'S WHA OUR FATHER DID, AND THAT IS OUR DUTY. THAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE. SO, WHEN YOU ALL GO HOME TODAY AND YOU THINK ABOUT THIS STORY, I WANT YOU ALL TO THINK OF EACH OTHER AS A FAMILY, BECAUSE THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT WE ARE.
