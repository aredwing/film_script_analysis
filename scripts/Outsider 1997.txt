Human body consists of skin, of subcutaneous tissue, of muscles and bones on which body is standing. We know two types of muscles. Smooth and striped. Cardiac muscle is a special type of striped muscle and it acts reflexely. Sit. Attention please, comrade principal wants to tell you something important. Pupils... To our school the certain information is being delivered and I, as a principal, feel responsibility to share it with you. Our president, comrade Tito, is being brought tomorrow here in Ljubljana, more precisely to clinical center. You're old enough to understand seriousity of situation. We can expect whole spectrum of provocations, because the enemy never sleeps. Would it be external or internal enemy. That's why if some stranger address you, or even foreign one, and ask you about condition at your home, or what your parents think... Kadunc and this new one, out! Wait me in front of the office. Your duty as a citizen and juvenile is, to report every such example of provocation to police, to your class teacher, or to call me personally. I'm appealing you, that in these difficult times, to prove as a juveniles worth of Titos name. Now we're fucked up. Why? Principal is crazy about the Party, it won't pass so good. Same as my dad. - Your dad is in the Party too? Army officer. - Officer? They're crazy about Marshall anyway. They would still play partisans and Germans in the woods... They won't get me, I'm not going in the Army. I won't serve do military service, I'll act as a fruitcake... or I'll run away abroad. And what are you gonna do there? I will push dope or I'll go to the oil platforms to drill the holes. Abroad is abroad, my friend. What do you know what is abroad? - I know. This is abroad for me, too. Are we going into the action tonight? To write graffitti? I'm seeing with Metka. We're going to the cinema. - Somebody's in love here. Come on, or we'll fucked up for this as well. Oh, there are comedians. Do you understand seriousity of situation in which we are now? No. Because if you'd know, you wouldn't act like that. Kadunc, do you wanna repeat this class for the third time? You know very well that there is no third repeating. Understand that? I can't hear your answer. Understood, comrade principal. My ass you understand! And your mother will come again to beg me to take you back. And do you know what I'm going to tell her? I'll tell her that you're an ordinary bum. And you, Sead Mulahasanovi, you started very well, here I have your characteristics, they're not bad, but if you continue to hang around with this bum Kadunc, you'll finish just like he did. Is that clear? Clear, comrade principal. This way: You both are getting principal's reprimand and after next offense, you'll be expelled. Comrade principal? - Yes? Just not a reprimand. What I'm going to do with you? - I don't know. My father will kill me. Mulahasanovi, remember... It must be a penalty. I believe your going to improve and then we'll talk in a different way. Is that so, my corporal? So, you attack my queen? OK, if you want so... Here - chess. Don't, comrade Warrant officer. What if I move my pawn here? What then? Then, you won't get by very well, my amateur. Warrant officer Mulahasanovi. Yes, I am on duty. A graffitti? What graffitti? Is that some joke? Who? Where? Who is that? Listen, call Rajkovi and alja. Either someone joke with us, either we have a visit. We'll finish this later. Call them! Hold it! What is this? What is says? Are you crazy? Do you know if this is '43, that you'd be shot at once? Oh, my boy. Corporal! Take him to the office. Let the boy have a rest of drawing. I go to check out the guards. Let's go! Graffitti, eh? Fuck your graffitti. Say, what does it mean this A inside O? What is your name? Give him to me. Then, what's your name? Thanks Sead, for taking me home. You don't have to go further with me, I live just behind the corner. I really must go now, it's late. Metka. I... I would just like to... hug you. I must go, it's really late. Have a nice sleep. I will. Sead, take some more. I can't, mom, really. I must take one more plate, dead or alive. Anyway, I've had alot of work last night. Beans like paradise. Say, Sead... What is youth writing on the walls here? I don't understand at all. I don't know what that means. What? - This... Can you imagine, last night some bozo jump over my fence, and in the middle of the barracks he started to write some... foolishness. In English. I don't know what persuaded him to do this, but he won't do it anymore. Marija, beans are... If I'd live 100 years more, I wouldn't know that there's a band named Sexual Pistols. What, Sead? Do you listen those Pistols too? I've heard for them. What was that last night? Nothing. We will interrogate him a bit, and tomorrow we'll give him to the police. Marija, gimme some bread, please. His father is bigtime hoodlum as well. Kadunc. Fucker... How is his name? Who, senior or junior? Junior. Borut. Dad, do you know what you did? - What? That's my... Wait! Come back over here. What is he to you? Nothing. He goes in my class. He goes in your class, eh? What that school teaches you? To write on the walls? Listen Sead, if I hear that you're involved in these bullshit, you'll have some business with me. Clear? - Clear. Wait. - Haris, let him go. What's up again? - Don't speak with me like that! Take your plate to kitchen, fix everything. Then you are free. At ease. How something like that could happen? And why I wasn't informed? I'm here to help you, so I will listen to all of your proposals. Sead, you disappointed me mostly. How come you didn't notice what's happening with Kadunc!? We as a colective, will must prevent this. Because of emergency situation, which occured because of intolerable behavior of Borut Kadunc, a pupil of 4F class, by decision of the school board and board of Youth organization, we are compelled to next measures: A) To Borut Kadunc, right for education and membership in Youth organization is being taken from. B) 4F class is punished by reprimand. Also, its appearance for the School's day is being banned. C) Forbidden is wearing of badges, torn pants and signs on the jackets, as any other ornament which isn't worth of our school's image. Long live The League of Communists of Yugoslavia, headed by comrade Tito! We are punished with the right, but class must continue its way. Let's prove that 4F didn't stumble. Zbanik and the rest, you've heard about the badges. Sead, believe me, nothing more couldn't be done. My dad did everything. Don't be like that, you must think on yourself a bit. Look, month will pass very quickly, he'll get out from the jail, you'll do a record... everything will be as before. Metka, open those beautiful eyes for awhile! What do you see? A month? It must pass at least... Don't play smart, wanna go to jail too? You know, what, call me when you sober up a bit. Metka! Corporal, Happy New Year, be good or bad. Cheers, com. Warrant officer. - Cheers. Sit. Stand up. For your family, corporal. Cheers. What? You didn't get used to home-made, eh? - Not that, but what's much, it's much. Much? We didn't drank one liter yet. But it is strong, in fact. Janez from your department gave me it. His dad is doing it. Then, we can take another one. - We do. Now for your health, comrade Warrant officer. Alright! And for your family. What do you know about my family? - Nothing, just like that. Screw such family. Wife is crying, and my kid went to morons. We were all the same in these age. - It's not like that, my Kvrgi. He's hanging around with those... these graffitti. -Punks? Yes. I don't like that. They paint their hair, wear chains around neck. They look like an idiots. Nonsense. Is it possibly some new party, eh? Com. Warrant officer... - It's not that. I wanted my son to become someone. Like, pilot. Flying above the clouds. And a red star on the tail of the plane. I don't like that, Kvrgi. I'll fix it up everything. I'll kill all of them like Krauts, if need. Don't... - Stand still! Com. Warrant officer... Shut up! Look this. Happy New Year! Hey, Rat, gotta smoke? Here he is! Gimme some wine. Got something hard? -Standard or double? - Gimme double. They fucked you up good, eh? Don't ask. I wouldn't wish this to anyone. Fucked up, man, fucked up. What happened? Cops are cool... who thaught that, but what the army is doing... In the barracks? First, I've had to sing for 2 hours "Hey, brigates!" What was later? Then, some bald officer came, fucked up as hell. He jerked me off about punk, whom I know... what I do... Two thugs were next to him, one beat me from morning to lunch, the other one from lunch to morning. Hey, Sid, where do you go? For a phone call. 'Allo it's Sead, sorry I didn't call you before. Yes, I know... They let Bomb out. They release him for a New Year... ... 8 months conditionally. What do you do now? You do French salad? Metka, let's meet. Why? Who's coming? Come on Metka, I'll wait you at the pole. What I'm going to do now? Nothing. How can you say that? OK, say hello to father and the guests, see you tomorrow and Happy New Year. Rat. - What? What? You think the 'Coma'? OK, but they're strong, don't blame me if you will feel bad. Scared, huh? Hey, it's a New Year, puke for me a bit! I've told you they're strong as hell, but no one is listening to me. You'd poison your own mother! My mother is a lady for you! Sober up already! Where can we get more drinks? Comradess Mulahasanovi, Happy New Year! Happy to you too! Where have you been by now? Don't ask, I freezed myself. Car too. We pushed it all the way to Kolinska. You? - I'm watching it. How is Nori doing? - He's not yet. I have something for you. What did you bring? In this house one will never watch in black and white again. Clear? Look. Filter, Marija. A filter. Is it better? It is. What's that? - Filter. We are going to visit your parents. Five days. How? -Five days, I couldn't get more. It's taken from summer vacation. It is because Marshall is seriously ill. We are going? Where is the kid? - He's sleeping. Is it better? Stand up, army! Happy New Year! Sead my son, happy new year. Wake up, son, we're going to visit grandparents. Come on. -Dad, let me sleep. You go wherever you want to. Come on, Sead, son. You won't? You won't? - I won't. Is there any thing you do want? - I want to sleep. You sleep for the last 18 years, and you still haven't sleep enough. You were sleepin' long enough, and I guarantee you'll wake up this year. Otherwise... - Otherwise what? You know very well. You'll send me to military academy? - Maybe I will. You just send, screw you. What? What did you say!? - I said what you heard. Stand still! Stand still! On the back seat, there is no space. Holy fuck! What are you doing with this car? When did you change the oil? Are you listening to me? I'm talking to you. There's no help with shouting. I only need this. I'm not going anywhere. Woman, don't mumble. Please, don't mumble. Wait a bit. - We are going! Out of the question! I don't wanna hear a single word. Let him do what he like, if he thinks that's the best. But he won't screw with me anymore. Understood? Fucking car. There. Why, Metka? - ''Why?'' Because. I'd be with you gladly. But I can't. We are never together. - How? We are always together. Never. Tell your father you're sick. What is with you? I can't do this to him, he paid and reserved all, we go to vacation every year, I can't. Sead, don't complicate if it doesn't have to. A week will pass very quickly, then we will be together again. Damn, as I fuck the fence! Drunk pig. Easy, Easy, you now. There is enough for everybody. Man, you wanna screw a bit? Chick is so drunk, she'd gave to anyone. Hey, hallo? Do you hear me? What's with you? - Nothing, nothing. Did that broad fucked you up completely? Easy? Easy, Easy! You know what? Wanna jam a bit? Three of us? - Yeah. Come on, let's jam. Hey, we are gonna jam now, OK? Did you tuned up already? -We did. Let's do that song of his.

Sead, do you realize that you have files now and that first offense can led you to juvenile home? You know what that means? No. - Social service sends you to juvenile home, you get in bad company, which teach you much worse things... Like stealing at first, we catch you, lock you up. You get 2 years conditionally at best... When it happens for the 2nd time, it doesn't matter if you've been involved, judge convicts you as you already have files. And a vicious circle is closed. Now, think if this is a worthwhile or not. You can go now. Do you aware of situation? - No. Want me to help you? Want me to help you more? Is it about Tito or what...

You wanna go down to gym? - No, thanks. Well Kadunc, you had nice conditionally sentence, and now you're about to sit in a jail for awhile. Sead. - How come you?

History - B. Single party-system and basis of the Marxism - B. Physics - B. Haris, why's that? - He knows very well. He's got two reprimands. ''Insulting of character and work of comrade Tito.'' Are you out of your mind? How long you'll make me blush in front of people? Do you know what's the situation in the country? External enemy at the borders, internal awaits for every chance and you play the wiseass here. It's not my blame. - Is it mine, then? Why your ex-friend Kadunc didn't think earlier about it? I don't wanna hear any word about this. - So, you won't. I won't. - You won't! So I won't! Little girl was sewing a red star A star red like a blood and she sang this song a song about days of freedom. Little girl was singing a song as young partisan came to her who fought for golden freedom for peasant's and worker's home. You sew your red star, little girl, and then sing cheerfully, to black fascist Gestapo, we gave bloody battle. Sead, I am pregnant. What? - I am pregnant. Really? -Please, let's go somewhere for a talk. Please. Sead and Metka, where are you goin'? Metka is not feeling very well. Alright, but come back until speech of comrade nidari.

When a broad fuck your brains up, that's really a shit, eh? She's not a broad. I bet we'll take him to pumping even today. She's not a broad. - She isn't. She's not. Waiter! Bring two pints over here. It's enough already, man. Two pints here! - You've got enough. For Bomb. I haven't seen him for three months. OK, for Bomb. It could be expected. They've had him at gunpoint long ago. Because of his father. Oh, you don't know... His father was a manager of this... How it calls? Export company. - Of some export company. He had to hand over certain amount of cash somewhere abroad, and then he went and lost without any trace. He do a runner. Bomba was still a kid. Dad left him and the mother, he remembers him only from the photos. That's how it started. They kicked him out from every school. For staying in this gymnasium, he only has to thank to his mother who has connections. - That's right. Redneck! Shut up, redneck. Whom did you tell ''Redneck'', you bum? What, you want something, eh?

Right. -Those are foolishness for you!? We live like Gypsies. One year in every city. Do you think about anything else but your orders and how to carry out them!? Do you think about the fact that my school is here and my graduation is in a 15 days? Mother feels good only here and you promised her that she'll stay. Sead, my son, everything will be alright.
