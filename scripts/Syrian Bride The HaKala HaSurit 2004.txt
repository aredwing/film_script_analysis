Their citizenship is defined by Israel as "Unidentified".

No problem, just wait there. Israeli Police, Northern District HQ Today's a big day for the Druze of the Golan. The pro-Syrian Druze might provoke the demonstrators supporting the new President and cause a riot which could turn violent. Therefore we must be careful today. Questions? OK, let me remind you there's a wedding at the Kuneitra border today at 3pm. No problem, except the bride is the daughter of Hammed Salman who's pro-Syrian, out on parole, and there's a warrant against him going to the border region. Clear? Hammed! When is Marwan arriving? I need someone to help me. He'll be here soon, his plane landed at six. But you can't rely on Marwan with these things. And when is Hattem supposed to arrive? If Amal and my daughters were back, they'd help. Who'll help me? Everyone will be at the demonstration. No one'll help me! Amin, stop complaining! Go and slaughter some more sheep. Ready? Yes. One, two, three! Smile, everybody. Together! Mona, what's wrong? Did something happen? Isn't she a beautiful bride? Yes. We'll never see her again. What do you mean? She'll come visit, won't she? Why won't you see her again? I don't get it at all. I'll miss you. Film me, I want to say something. Tallel, when you see this, Mona will already be your wife. It's the last time I see her. We're giving you our treasure. Protect her like the apple of your eye. Watch over her. Congratulations to the bride. Best wishes, Mona. The village elders are here. Go inside. Hello. Hello. Go to your room. Go upstairs... Listen, Hammed... You know how much we respect you. We've heard your son Hattem's coming to the wedding. As far as we're concerned, he's outcast since he married the Russian. If he shows up, you won't see us here. Dear friends, Hattem hasn't been here for more than 8 years. Today is his sister's wedding. You know that this will be his last chance to see her. Listen, Hammed, you know how much we appreciate you. If it were anyone else, we wouldn't have troubled ourselves to come. We'll never forget what you did for our village nor your years in jail. But this is different! If you prefer him... and go against our religion, you will lose our support and we will cast you out, too. Long time since you've been here? Yes, almost 8 years. Seriously? 8 years? You'll behave yourself at Grandfather's house, promise? Hattem? Let's go over the Arabic you taught me. How do you say "Congratulations"? Hallo? Congrations... How you are? You can speak English. My sisters understand English. Why? Don't I speak well? I won't speak at all then. Try to get some sleep. You worry too much. You'll improve with time. Relax, your parents will love him. UN Headquarters, Golan Heights Huge crowds this morning at the central square of Damascus to pay their respect to the late President and welcome his son, Basher el-Assad That's the way it is. Bless you. May God please you. Greetings! Congratulations! Our beloved president Bashar el-Assad will deliver his speech from the Parliament: The Israeli withdrawal in the 80s and 90s and the retreat from Lebanon this past May proved the importance of our solidarity... He looks even tougher than his father. People of Majdal! Come to the village square! Join the demonstration for our new President, Basher el-Assad I'll be back. Don't worry! Go ahead, I'll join you soon. Don't be late, Hammed. Dad! Are you going to the demonstration? I won't be late. Please don't go. Your parole terms forbid you to do that. Please don't go. For Mona's sake. Why don't you let this day go on peacefully? We don't want to visit you in jail again. I have to go. What will people think? That Hammed is a coward? You haven't slept well since you came out of jail. You're haunted by nightmares. Don't worry about me, Amal. They can't hurt me. Join us, the Syrians are close to our hearts! Join us, the Syrians have sacrificed their blood! Unity, national unity. The Golan belongs to Syria. With spirit, with blood, we'll redeem Bashar! With spirit, with blood, we'll redeem Bashar! Hammed... Hammed! Come here! Come! Aren't you on parole? What are you doing here? Go home. - I'm not leaving. - Don't provoke me. You know what happens to those who provoke me! Remember or should I remind you, 5002? You still remember my number. Even I forgot it. I'm not afraid of you. I was never afraid of you. A country of criminals! For 33 years you are occupying us without shame. Hammed, go home. Your daughter is getting married. With spirit, with blood, we'll redeem the Golan! I'll miss you. I'll be lonely there. I'm afraid. Don't be afraid. Tallel will love you and you'll love him. It won't be like your previous marriage. It's different this time. What makes you so sure? Life with him could turn out to be a lot worse than my life now. Perhaps I'm going from one jail to another one. Stop it. You'll have a much better life there. And what if we don't get along? I won't be able to come back here. Stop being so pessimistic! Stop it! I'm marrying someone I only know from television. At least you knew Amin before you married him. Knew him? I saw him once when he came to fix our roof! A week later we were engaged... A month later married... And then I was pregnant. You're not happy. You were never happy with Amin. How can I leave you here? Wow, what a mess. Do me a favor, take your suitcases and get out. What do you mean "get out"? My house is on the other side of the village! I don't want these Arabs to throw stones at my cab. Mom, who are those people? Come on, get out already! We have to get out. Hold it, hold it... Did you get me the whiskey? I swear I was delayed at the airport. They gave me hell. Why don't you believe me? Calm down, relax. Don't get upset. I promise I'll meet you with the money in 2 hours, OK? Bye. Asshole. Hattem! Marwan? It's my brother! Marwan! Come on, get in! Amal! Mother! Marwan? Welcome home, son. I have a surprise. Amal? Hattem! Darling! Darling! Meet Evelina, my wife. Congrations. And this is our son Hammed. God bless you, son. Hattem! - You look stunning! - My turn now! Majdal hasn't seen such a demonstration for years! Bashar's speech was very good. He's Assad (lion) son of Assad. - Welcome home, son. - Father... God bless you, Father. How are you? Don't you want to welcome your son? Come in. It's been 8 years, and he still won't talk to me. I thought he would soften up over the years. Maybe you were right. We shouldn't have come here. How long can one hide? Enough! I'll try to convince Dad. He'll agree in the end. Mom agrees, Dad is the problem. You have to be patient. I have no problem waiting, but are you sure you'll convince him? Who was it? He must have seen us! Byan, clean out the blood before it dries. Slaughter the remaining sheep. No need to slaughter more. You want people to say my father-in-law feeds his guests like he was fed in the Israeli prison? No way! - Is everything all right? - Yes. - Forget anything? - No. Abu-Salim, we need three more tables. - Where from? - The neighbors. Where's Marwan? Where did that monkey go? Hello, Salach. Hammed! Doesn't Hattem's son look just like his Aunt Mona? No, he looks like the Russian... Want to marry an Israeli collaborator? He's not. His father is. Shut up! Don't say a word. You're not marrying him as long as I live. Clear? OK, let me go back to Granddad. You're not going anywhere! Go to your room! Beat it! I don't want to see you! School of Social Work at Haifa University Marwan, how did you know my favorite perfume? Looks like Tallel, right? Only God knows if he's a good man. If my deal goes through, I'll buy you great gifts. Amal, I'll buy you a car. No... I'll take you and Amin to Italy. - Only without Amin. - OK, without Amin... For you Mona, I'll get... a private jet, so you can come visit us. I'll teach you how to fly it. I'm going to look for Hattem. And I must go help Amin before he murders me. Beat it! Are you spying on me?! Don't be angry with Dad. You know he loves you. His situation here is very sensitive. The elders came today, threatening to cast him out, too. And you know how they are. It makes me mad how much I know, but he shouldn't have given up on me. When has he given up on you? Didn't we grow up in the same house? Dad was never here for us. Have you forgotten? I haven't, Hattem. But this isn't a good time to settle accounts. You know the Israelis won't let him go to the border to send Mona off. Our father is dead inside. Don't make it any worse for him. I'm making it worse!? Try to understand, for me and for Mona's sake. Excuse me. It'll all work out after the wedding. Go to our mailbox and if you see a letter for me, bring it and don't let anyone know. Got it? Mom, I'm going to Kiryat Shmona. Don't go to the police. Your Dad'll be very angry. He doesn't need to know! If he asks, tell him I went to buy something. You know how much it will please Mona. I know, I know... Pray this day ends peacefully. I'll be back soon. She's blond, but she doesn't know how to slice a tomato. Yes, but Hattem's wife is a doctor. She runs a large hospital in Russia. She probably serves him hospital food. All the women wanted Hattem. He could have married the best local girl instead of the Russian. This is how you slice a tomato. Very thin. Hello... We... and tabula... Cousin! Tell the family your uncle passed away. May his soul rest in peace. May his soul rest in peace. And may God strengthen you so you can face this tragedy. Hi, Dad. How are you? How are you, Fahdi? How are things going at university? Thank God, going well. Tell me, son, is the wedding on as scheduled? Sure, Dad. Tallel and his family are on their way from Damascus. When are you coming to the border? I can't come. The Israelis don't allow it. I can't now. I'll call you later. - It'll be OK, Dad. How are you, Marwan? When did you arrive? Don't forget to send with Mona a kilo of coffee from the Golan. Coffee with spices. Is everybody OK? My plane arrives at midnight. Will Mom be at the airport? Is she bringing Ginger? Send my kisses to everyone. See you. A fine cigar from Cuba for my favorite uncle! If you make it stand on your mustache, I'll give you a bottle of whiskey! Marwan, what do you do abroad? Business. But what kind of business? What do you sell? Whatever comes to mind. Games for kids, games for adults. Watches... When'll you get married? We want to see your kids before we die. God willing. God willing we see your children or we die? Marriage isn't for him. He has many women. French, Italian, even Jewish! C'mon, what do you mean? I'll marry a local girl in the end. Nonsense, nonsense... You Druze know how to throw a wedding. Hold my calls. A Druze wedding is the real thing. Not like our weddings with the bad food... Been to one of our weddings? One? Why not a hundred? I have many friends in the Golan. In Majdal too. Most of my friends are Druze. Fine people. So can my father come to the border? - What did you say your name is? Amal? - Yes. How do you like your coffee? I buy only genuine Arab coffee. Rafi, two coffees please. Thanks. I can't approve it. Sorry. It's the last time he'll see his daughter. Don't take that away from him. If not for him, do it for her. It will break her heart. I feel for you, truly. He can't go near the security zone. What harm can he do there? Thank you, Rafi. Drink, it's genuine Arab coffee. I didn't come for coffee, I came to ask you for a favor. You can't stop me going to the border. - You're not going there. - But... No buts, you're not going, end of story. You treat me the same way the Israelis treat you. Your brother annoys me. - Welcome. - Congratulations. Thank you. Hi Uncle, how's it going? Mom, where have you been? - Where's Dad? - He went home. And Mai? She didn't return after the demonstration. OK, get something to eat. Mai isn't allowed out. It's your fault. You're too liberal. Amin, I didn't come here to argue. We need to go back to the wedding. Do you want people to distance themselves from us? Amal, I love you, but I can't stand the gossip. "Your wife wears pants, your daughter loves a collaborator". Isn't the shame of Hattem's marriage enough? - Hattem? - Yes, Hattem! You can't even look him in the eyes. This isn't the time. We must get back to my parents. So what are you waiting for? - And Mai? - She's grounded. Let her say goodbye to Mona. You know how attached they are. Coming? Only with Mai. Amal Safdi has been accepted into the B. A. Social Work Program. Mom, I'm sorry I caused you and Dad to fight. Now he won't let you go to university. Don't worry. It'll be all right. Everything will be fine. And you? What about you? God willing, your fortune will be better than mine. Don't give in the way I do. Don't you dare give up! I've already missed my chance but your entire life is ahead of you. Go wash your face and rest a while, I'll come back soon to take you to the border. But Dad will be furious. Let him. Go... Let me kiss you. Hello, my sweet! How are you? Please, enjoy... How did you find me? You told me. Me? When? "The place became crowded and the air thick. "I feel like I'm choking. "I feel there's no place on earth "which can contain my pain and suffering. "The apple tree is my well of secrets, I sit under it and cry. " I remember every word you sent me. Your letters kept me going in Russia. They made me feel I was still living among you, kept up-to-date with everyone's life. Tell me, how are things with Amin? As usual. What is "as usual"? What did you fight about? Trivial things. About your studies? Amal, listen to me. I'm not saying you should give up, but there are ways to persuade Amin. Amin loves and respects you. I don't know what to say. We haven't had a conversation in years, I'm used to writing you letters. It's easier for me. What's wrong? A tire exploded. People, get off the bus. We have a flat tire. God help us. - Yes? - Haven't you left yet, Joseph? I'm leaving. What's the rush? - Did you take the stamp I gave you? - A hundred times you asked me! - Did you take it? - I did, I did. Check again. Well? - I checked. - Good. Say, won't we have problems with this new stamp? No, these are the new regulations. It's fine. If they're the new regulations... - And don't forget to bring me apples from the Golan. - OK, OK. You've done a good job. - Give this to your men. - Thank you. God bless you. Dad, can I have a word? I went to see the police officer in Kiryat Shmona. Amal, you made a mistake. You humiliated yourself and you humiliated me. I thought it would please you. I went there for you. I know how much you want to see Mona off at the border. It wasn't easy for me to go to him, knowing what he has done to you. Plenty of wishes to the beautiful couple, my heart wishes them well Congratulate them and spread jasmine flowers all around We'll sing them wedding tunes Love will reside in their home at night God bless them with serenity Soon, it'll be everyone's luck, loved ones Let's go. Congratulations. Marwan, I'm off. What's wrong, Dad? Get in. Don't worry about the elders. They won't show up anyway. I know... I know. We'll worry about it after the wedding. Marwan, I'll be right back. Get in, Amal. Go without me. - Where are you going? - I'll follow you. What's going on? We'll be late! It's stuck, I can't undo it, sir! Let me do it. Let's go! What? What's going on? Just a minute. You can't stay here. Drive back. Right now! All of you, go to the parking lot. Wow, what a mess... Congratulations. Wait here! Wait here! Wait here! Don't you speak Hebrew? Wait! OK, congratulations. - Who are you? - I'm her father. Her father? OK... Hi sister, how are you? I hope Dad came with you! Don't worry, he'll show up. How do you know? I just know. Soldier, open the gate, please. Mom, why are you late? Everyone is already inside. - Who are you? - Her family. Her family... IDs please. The car goes to the parking lot. Amal, where have you been? I'm talking to you. Amin, leave me alone, not now! - You can go in. - Thank you. I'm speaking to you. Leave me alone, I said! Mom, wait for me. Mom... They haven't arrived yet? You see? I told you. - What happened to you? - My clothes got dirty... - And why are you late? - We had a flat tire. That's your bride Mona, and that's my sister, Amal. - What are you doing here? - Saying goodbye to my daughter. You're not supposed to be here. Come with me. Where to? I don't want to make a scene here. - Where do you take him? - Butt out. Marwan, wait. Marwan! You raise your child for 25 years and on the most important day of her life, you can't say goodbye? You can't enter a closed military zone. Military zone? Two caravans and your Israeli flag? You have contempt for our flag too? Your Syrian friends treated you better? Go before I arrest you. - You said he could... - I said nothing. - Where do you think you're going? - To say goodbye to my daughter. Stop, my dear! Stop! I'm scared. You be strong and proud. Do only what's right for you. You are Hammed's daughter. That's it? Did you say goodbye? Now get in the car. Everyone step back! - Why are you arresting him? - Back! - You too! - I'm his attorney. His attorney? - Yes. - Do you have a warrant? Show me a warrant. Otherwise, this arrest is illegal. You're off the hook. This time. Tension in the West Bank continues. Shots were fired at an army post near Nablus, no injuries reported... Are you in the Golan already? Don't forget to buy apples! OK, OK... In the Golan, demonstrations in support of the new President... - How are the apples? - Terrific. - Two boxes please. - No problem. What? Son, is something wrong? Where are you? Nablus? They said on the news there's shooting there. Are you sure? I'm worried and so is your mother. Promise me you'll take care. Great. Bye. - My son. - God bless him. - Thank you. - Have a nice day. - Hello, Joseph. - Hello, hello. Hello, have a seat. Thank you. Name: Mona Salman Nationality: Undefined Mother's name is Samiha? Father's name Hammed? Born on November 30th, 1976? Yes. Congratulations. Thank you. Look what I got from the policemen! - Dad! - I'll be right back. Don't worry, Dad, it will be OK. Welcome... welcome... Give her something to drink or she'll dehydrate. Does he want to eat? I'm fine. Two hours, man, two hours. My sister is getting married. What can I do? I'm at the border. I can't now. It will take time. I'll talk to you later, OK? Amal, relax. Let her speak! I'm sorry. It's bad luck not to get married on your wedding day. What's going on? Stay here! - Amin. - Dad? - Amal! Bring water! What's going on? Why the delay? Mona? Aren't the procedures over? I don't know. I'm sorry. It's OK, don't worry. I'm waiting for you. The family is dying to see you. I'm dying to see you, too. So am I. Don't you have something to say? No, I have nothing to say. I know you read the letter. Enough already. You can't stop me from going to university. The girls are grown up now, there are no excuses anymore. What people say is more important than what I want? Do you want people to say I'm not a man? That I can't control my own wife? Understand me, Amal. The Israeli army announced that Nablus is sealed off... Bring some water. OK. Minister's office. They're connecting me. No answer. I was cut off. What shall we do? - Would you like a seat? - Thank you. Worried because you don't know him? There are no rules for stuff like this. Marriage is like a watermelon. You can't tell what's inside till you open it up. It's a matter of fate. Do you believe in fate? Are you married? No, I'm not married. But I believe in fate. Why aren't you married? I'm not sure anyone will want me. I'm fat and I can't stop eating. You know, food is sort of a compensation... Hello? No, I can't make it. Find someone else. Aren't there other photographers in Kiryat Shmona? I'm stuck here with the Syrian bride. I'll find a replacement. What time is the Bar-Mitzva? It'll be OK. Bye. - See you. - Bye. What's new, son? Gun shots? Are you OK? Son, I'll get back to you. Guys, can someone bring me correction fluid? Correction fluid? I understand your pain, I have children too. - Here you are. - Thank you.

I'll take care of the coff... of Mona. What's wrong now? I can't sign something I don't understand. This is unbearable. I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
