I go to Arabic and sport lessons. Sport? Are you trying to beat the record for absences? Soufiane! Leave the dog alone. Mongrel! Calm down, have a drink. Malik, you're a good pal. Move back. My pals! Get up... Go to bed. Always late. Have you seen the time? Good-for-nothing. Have a good day, dear. Goodbye. How are they this morning? Not bad. Ten years and I still can't get it right. I can't get the proportions right. Too much butter, too much sugar, either that, or it's the flour... Why won't that thick head come back to work with me? He's experienced. He loved his father too much, he can't. He's enjoying himself! Introduce us. Allal, Soufiane. They're brothers to me. We share everything. What's wrong? We're not your type? Do you know her? Yes... no... I don't know. Her name's Dounia. She's a whore at the Passarella. Let's go to the Passarella. It's 3000 dirhams for a bottle of whisky. It's a rip-off. The Passarella is the place to be. It used to be, before the dealers moved in. Low-life chicken thieves! Throw them out! Chicken thieves... Chicken thieves... Us... Chicken thieves! You haven't got a scratch. It's us they wanted, not you. I heal fast. That's more like it, you're over her, then. Dounia? She's not a wound. I'm wounded all over because of her. Don't you dare go back! Passarella's not the only place around. True, but there's only one Dounia. Dounia is all there is. Get lost. Will you come back to class? I said, beat it. Stop thief! Catch him! Stop thief! It's a Gucci. Sell it. The perfume, too. Get rid of the rest. Here. And quit school. What good did his school certificate do him? Get up here! None. Work, school, marriage, kids, all that crap just to keep us quiet. They give us just enough to stop us from dying. I don't want to get up at 5 a.m. everyday to clean up their shit. Soufiane, give the bag back. We're through with stealing. We manage to get beer money, that's enough. Speak for yourself! Shut up. I didn't say you could speak. I should leave you 2 days in this hole. I heard you. Stop thief! Stop thief! Me, a thief? What about you? You leave me there like a fool, with a sprained ankle. Did you spare us a thought? Don't let me hear you say that again! I was hung by my ankles two days and didn't rat you out. What? Are you going to spend your life stealing balls? Then what? Stealing soap in toilets to sell it on in Mali? Is that what you want? And being insulted in night clubs? If you want to be a chicken thief, I won't stop you. Each to his own. Hey, guys, want to pop in at the Passarella? Just one drink. No way. A drink with Dounia. With your mother! Son of a bitch. He's talking about Dounia, the son of a bitch. Beat it! Stop it, guys! Mind your own business. Let me go. Guys, a quick visit... ...you only get what God wants for you. A Hadith said: When two people get together, God is their witness. He's always with us. God is unique... And Mohammed is His prophet. Move it! Take your sister to the factory, the buses are on strike. Wake up, dammit! No need to shout. Ask him nicely. He'll go, she's his sister. How's your father? Drinking his beer. He's fine. You were a nice guy. But you turned stupid when you stopped drinking. Don't set foot here again! Lazy idiots, you're useless! Shall we go? You don't have to. It's OK, I'm up now. You'll catch cold. I'm on the dole, you're the one who mustn't catch cold. You're so stubborn. Who? You or me? I'm going to Tangiers on Saturday. Cover for me, so they don't find out. What will you say? That I'm at Sal, with our aunt. She has no mobile, so I can't be reached. Do as you please. Are you sure he'll get divorced? Yes. But when he told his wife, she tried to commit suicide. She was in hospital for a month. And you believed him? I've told you, first chance he gets, he'll leave you for someone younger. Wait! Wait! In orderly fashion, or no one gets in. Come in, madam. One by one, nice and orderly. That's all for now. Come back this evening. Malik! Come on. Aouatif? Is your handsome brother up for marriage? Watch it, you! They mustn't catch you. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. If it exhausts you, stop. Leave her be, she's helping us out. Great. I didn't have the Boss one. Bring the table. Here, sweetheart. Wait. The meeting place has changed. I'll count them and leave them on the table for you. Show us what you've got. Take a look. Here. It's good stuff. Shall we pay? - Yes. Go and see what's going on. I knew it. You hadn't finished him off. He's a weakling. You have to be tougher. Malik! Malik? Thanks. What's with the blood? It takes blood to become a big shot. Power... blood. Dough... blood. Everything is paid in blood. Let's swap. Why won't you go to bed with me? Answer. What did I do wrong? Allal won't pay me if you don't. Don't turn away. Tell me. Tell me... Omar wants to meet you. I'd like to present him to you. He's a boss, I'm on the dole. We've nothing in common. Please, come. It's too complicated, you two... He's parked over there. Come on... Malik! Where's Allal hiding? I don't know him. Yet he's living with you. So? I haven't seen him for ages. Take him away. The clean-up has started. They've got the big shots. With my record, one zealous cop could get me 10 years. They came to the house yesterday. They're after me. They want to up their solve rate. I'll hide in the mountains, at my grandfather's. I'll call you later. What about us? - Don't worry, it's nothing to do with you. Take care. What did you arrange, for the payment? Did they give you a date? A voucher? It's not the post office. Leave me alone. They'll pay you when they sell them. Call them if you don't believe me. You've got their number. Please, leave me alone. Who is it? My sister, Rabiaa. Come in. Welcome. How are you? The children? Welcome. How are you, brother-in-law? Is Aouatif with you? What? What a journey! The train stopped for 2 hours at Ksar Sghir. A news bulletin: There was a raid yesterday against several drug barons... And Aouatif? Where's Aouatif? She told me she was at her aunt's. Maybe she came but I didn't see her. What d'you mean? Is this some joke? They missed each other, that's all. Do you think I'm stupid? I'm the joke of the neighbourhood. Shhh. - Shut up, you! Where is she? ...several drug barons arrested yesterday... She rang to say that she was at her aunt's. The police raid had been well-prepared... Turn it down! What? Your sister is goodness knows where and you sit there glued to the TV? Switch it off! Get out of here! Don't touch the TV! I'm watching the news! Yeah, right! The news! Let go! Get out of here! Do you want me to get mad? I'm the one who'll get mad! Get away, you! Calm down, Hamdane! And you, respect your uncle! You're acting like children. What are you looking at? They've picked up dealers at Tetouan. Dealers! That's all we need. There! Damn you all! We have to free Dounia. From where? The police station. You're out of your mind! You want to attack the police station? I can't leave her there. Wake up. You'd risk your neck for her? Forget her! We need money. Why should we wait for Allal? We got by before. Listen, Nadia has a rich friend. She'll help us. She'll distract her, I'll steal her bag. You just have to follow me. I know the streets. Let go of me! Leave me alone! Get off my back! Beat it! Leave me be! I told you to move! I'm begging you! Aouatif! Malik! Help me. Your uncle's going to kill your sister. Don't worry, they fight all the time. Please, come! Hamdane is always fighting with someone. Let him. It's Aouatif's turn! Please... help me. Listen, aunt... Don't worry, they always make up. Malik! Hello. This is for my cousin... What's her name? - Dounia. Is she a singer? - A singer? Sounds like a singer's name. My uncle loves musicals, that's why. Poor thing! What's in there? Food... Food? You're fond of your cousin. No problem, give it to me. Thanks. Can I come with you? Where is he? He didn't do anything. God called her back to Him. She's gone, we can't bring her back. She hanged herself. Where is he? He did nothing. Where is he? She hanged herself! Calm down, Malik! Stop thief! - Get him! Thief! Son of a bitch! - Move! Filthy thief! - Bastard! Hit him! Here, miss. - Thief! Say you're sorry. I'm sorry. Come on, children... back to class! Listen to me! Go inside, we'll take care of him. Give him what he deserves. God be with you. We'll make a list of thieves, faggots and tramps who hang around school. We'll hang them all, like this asshole. And then? - We'll kill them. Easy! We torture them, then sell them to whoever wants them. They can kill them as they please. Hey, who are these guys? Who are they? What are you doing on my patch? Who taught you to hang people like this? In an Islamic land! He's a thief! A thief has the right to be judged for his own redemption. Who will judge him? He will be judged according to Sharia law. He was a thief. What about you? You sin, you drink alcohol! Cut him down if you want me to pardon you. Never. If you want him, you pay. You're a real hot-head, eh? Want me to cool it for you? If you weren't just kids... Let him go! Get out of here! Are you sure? Go and see inspector Debbaz. First floor. No, the bakery is just a cover. He deals dope. I don't like him selling to kids. He's just small-time. You won't find much at the bakery. Allow me. Shall I put them here? - Yes. Like I said, inspector, I don't like him selling dope to kids. It's not only hashish, other drugs too. How long has he been dealing? Since my father's death. Since he's been running the bakery. My mother doesn't know. You'll get the other half when I see with my own eyes. Keep it, inspector. There's a prisoner here called Dounia. If you could let her go, I'd be grateful. Please... Tell me what's going on! You're ruining my goods! Have mercy! My bread! You haven't seen anything yet! At least tell me what's going on! We found this in a bag of flour. I swear, I don't know where that came from. Take him away. Have mercy... Beat it! Let us do our job! He hasn't done anything! Let my husband go, I beg you! A deal here, a theft there, trafficking, a madman who thinks he's in Tora Bora... You tell me and I'll take care of it. No worries for you. No more thieving for you. All expenses paid by me. You really like me. Yes, I do. You were made for this job. What job? Snitch? Wait, I'll be back. Forgive me for the other day, I didn't do it on purpose. So I'm right for the job? For being a snitch? So what? It's a job like any other. You even denounced your father. He's not my father! He's my uncle. He married my mother to get his hands on the bakery. You should have seen the bakery before! Those were the good times. He even sold the shop window! The window! Forget that now. You'll go far. And remember, I was the one to tell you. You'll go far. If you give me good tips, I'll spoil you. You'll be a cop. By the way... I'm releasing Dounia tomorrow. Do you know the Mirada hotel? Go and see Houcine. He'll give you a room for two. You work by day and go back to her in the evening. Take care of her and she'll respect you. A woman is only a woman, but a man must be a man, a real man. Has he been before the prosecutor? Do you want to see him? I never want him to see the sun again! Son of a bitch! He killed my sister! You can rely on me. - My sister. Have a chip. The son of a bitch killed my sister. Come on, move it! Show some spirit! Sit down. Here. It's a gift from God. CDs and DVDs. Sell them everywhere. At factory exits, in the mosques, in cafs, schools... Every step you take will be a good deed. Don't sell them for too much. 5 or 6 dirhams at most. Keep the money. On one condition. No more stealing, no more sinning. God will help you. Inch'Allah. I'm tired, I want to stay here. I don't have the strength to go to the city. You can go where you like. You'll always come back here. Your roots are strong now. And your branches free. God be with you. About time! Do you never clean the place? Six reds, 32 beers, 2 bottles of Ricard... Looks like you're having a good time. Aren't you going to say hello? That's no way to say hello. How are you, princess? Come and sit down. Aren't you going to ask how I am? Don't you miss your daddy? Come closer. D'you have relatives here? - No. And you? Any family left? Come here. The three of us could be a nice family. Come on, let's go out for a walk. When I was a kid, I loved to see the local youths climb in with the cops and speed away, American-style. We're not playing Starsky and Hutch here. Look only at this mosque. With a bit of effort, you'll get invaluable information out of them. You know that CD seller... No, I don't know that sort of guy. There are a lot around. - Yes. May I leave? I haven't cuffed you, you can go. Come here. Here, take care of yourself. Man mourns the pleasures of life, forgetting that happiness lies in letting them go. Why don't you answer your phone? I've got a plan. You have to answer, so I know what to do. Who is he? Don't you remember? He was with me at the Passarella. What does he want? I can't be with you tomorrow. How come? - I just can't. Where is he taking you? I don't remember him very well. Malik, I don't like it. I have to work. How will we manage otherwise? What about the job for the inspector? Do it. No? What d'you mean? It's a job like any other. I'd rather you worked for the inspector. It's obvious your friend Allal is a bastard and chases girls. Chases girls? And I run after boys, right? Here, 5 dirhams. These are hard times. OK, that's fine. Listen carefully to what I tell you. There's a lot of dope around, but no buyers. They arrested all the big shots. I met with the growers and I understand how things work. They used to grumble that they didn't earn enough. Now, they'll sell at any price. This is our chance. We take it, or live in poverty all our lives. The Spanish are begging to buy. It's a great plan. We must get busy while the big shots are in prison. What d'you think? What about contacts? Money? To pay the boats, the smugglers. We haven't got what it takes. It's all taken care of. I've got a sure contact with the Spanish. The smugglers are in place. The money is in Mehdi Square. Have you got hidden treasure there? The Spanish jeweller, behind the cinema. Know it? I've been casing it. I have a plan. We'll do a hold-up and sell off the jewellery. That'll get us going. That's a great mobile. It's an MP4 player. A different tone for each caller. I immediately know who's calling. Cretin. Get rid of that tone or I'll beat the shit out of you. I don't want that Christian's money. Keep my share. When he's in my sights, take the money and I'll take care of him. What? Take the gems and let me take vengeance. What did he do to you? Lots of things. Palestine, Iraq, Andalusia. Andalusia? What's the fucking connection? What did they tell you? I was an empty bin. Just useless noise. Praise be to God. - What? You've gone all pious? You want to kill an 80 year old? I see you're a man now. Those are my terms. When do we do it? No way! If you want in, you can start by shaving your beard. Kill him? That's bullshit. You want to make the headlines? Take your share. After, do whatever you want. Give it to your Muslim brothers, throw it away... but no killing. Or I'll take care of you myself. Hey, Soufiane! Come back, you rotten kid! Allal! Let's go back. We can't see a thing. We can't just leave him. He'll die of cold. Allal! I can't see a thing! Don't leave me alone! No... I don't believe it. We open the door slowly. Then we draw the shutter. What about the people at the caf? One of us will be at the caf to create a diversion. Nobody will notice us. Where's Malik? This is the second time he hasn't come. He's with his whore. Didn't you know? They're living together. - Dounia? He spent all his money on her. She's one of the few who were released. Maybe she knows someone in power. Just my luck. Him with his whore and you with your beard. Why are you standing in my way? Don't you want me to meet God with a pure heart? Let me do my duty. Why do you defend that Christian? Christian, Jew, Buddist, I don't care. You can't kill him. How much did they pay you? This has no price. Fight those who fight you, in the name of God and do not persecute. For God does not like persecutors. Shit! You're way off track. I thought you'd stopped smoking and started praying. But this is madness. May God forgive you and put you back on the right track. This is bullshit! Get in! Kiss her. Kiss her. - What do you mean? Kiss her. - I just did. Kiss her. Get out! What do you take me for? Who do you think you are? What d'you think I am, a pimp? The hotel, your whore, money. And no info? I'm good to you, but you've given me nothing. No tips. You'll see. Dounia'll go back to jail. Leave her alone. I'm onto something. Wait. How can I be sure? I give you my word. You've got three days. If you bring me nothing, you'll see what happens. Luckily, I'm a kind man. If not, you'd be in a cell by now. Listen... You've got three days to pay the rent or you're out. Get it? If you want to change, your clothes are here. Trust isn't part of our vocabulary. I thought everything would work out. Now we're back to square one. He wants a tip-off or he'll cut off supplies. He's right. If you want to be paid, you have to work. What's the deal? I stalled. I said yes. Being a snitch isn't my thing. I did think about it, though. Allal's plan is a good one. Except that Soufiane wants to screw it up. What should I do? My head's about to explode. You don't know what other people are thinking. Think about us. We must stay together. I've never trusted your friends. You're going to steal again? It's back to square one? You have to stop. Or you'll lose me. Allal has always been there for me. One day, he saw I had a black eye, so he threatened my uncle with a knife. He never hit me again. I hated him even more. A coward. I never wanted to be like him. But I'm a doormat. People walk all over me. Forget the inspector. Don't steal, don't snitch. They've reopened the Passarella. I'll go to work for a day or two. Stop it! I'll take care of everything. Don't worry. I just want to be with you. Do what you must, but I don't want to lose you. Don't leave me. You know where I'd like to live? In your eyes. Kiss me. Piss off! The joint's covered in sand. It's a summer joint. The sand gives it a holiday flavour. Even broke, we're always on holiday. And it'll stay that way. But after the job, we won't be broke. Soufiane... here. I don't smoke anymore. Go on, have a toke. The beard didn't even suit you. See how handsome you are. How did you get involved with them? Aren't we Muslims for you? OK, we steal, we smoke, we drink. But we fast and give alms. One day, we'll start praying. We'll have money, go to Mecca. If we were bad guys, we'd have thrown you out with all your crap. You have to be straight up to deserve this job. At least he comes to meetings. Unlike you. D'you spend all night screwing? Yeah right, you're dating a whore. Allal, don't call her a whore! Don't call her a whore! What did she do to you? It's none of your business! She's making you lose your senses! You'd better not have told her. What do you take me for? Still awake, darling? Your mobile was off again. I wouldn't have heard it. I was in a club. Aren't you going to kiss me? Where were you? I was bored. I met my friends. Your friends? Who are your friends? Whores? You've been out with whores again? Are you doing tricks? You couldn't resist? You're calling me a whore? Faggot! Stop it! What's going on here? Let go of that! What the hell's going on? Any more of this and I'll call the inspector. He'll take care of you! Go to bed, you. It's all right. I gave you everything, Malik. I've never loved anyone the way I love you. I've never been more scared for someone other than myself. I can't take it anymore. I'm exhausted. Go away. Get out. Go back to your friends. I don't want this love anymore. I don't want it anymore. It's 10 a.m. and he's already made at least 40.000 dirhams. Let's do it this afternoon. Why wait two days? Imagine we come in the morning and find nothing. Getting the gold is already pretty good. How's my mother? She cries about you. But she's getting used to it. Do people say I'm a bad son? Damn them all. People get the most pious about other people's sins. I've found some firestairs going up to the terrace. We're lucky, it's an old building. They built well back then. They thought of everything, even an exit for robbers. We park the car out back and get out over the terrace. What car? How else will we get away? You can't even drive and you talk about cars? What did you think your part was? You'll drive. - Where to? The Bahamas. We'll go and visit the tomb of Tony Montana. Go slow. Watch out for cops. Say: The cops! Who else causes chaos in this country? The cops... Enough said. We should have taken his money. What money? He who wants to beg must go to the great mosque. Right? Money for petrol, knives... Knives? What for? Nothing. To be on the safe side. Allal, we've got the car. What? What? What? - Get out. Soufiane, get out. - Malik! Soufiane, get out. Are you deaf? Beat it! You see who you're with? You've become blind and deaf. Wake up and finish it. Hit her if you want to. Then get out. Here are the numbers of the notes I paid her with. Open her bag and check. I'm not the first, nor the last. She'll throw you out like an empty beer can. He knocked. He said you'd sent him. Then he pushed me. And he raped me. He wants to split us up. Everybody does. Let's get out of here. Theft, murder. A Christian might even die. Dounia! That's the best one yet! Just the right ring tone. I want you to charge him. Ah Allal, you dared to do that. I never want to see him again. Answer. And tell me everything. Two tickets for Marrakech, tomorrow at 10 a.m. How much? - 160 dirhams. You're completely crazy. Go on, copy me. Recharge this card. And keep your phone on. If I'm not there at ten, leave without me. Don't wait for me. May God help you. Call this breakfast? Is this orange juice? You call this orange juice? There's nothing decent to eat in this place! Calm down, mister. All I ask is a decent orange juice! You're talking to the boss. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Where's Soufiane? Where's Soufiane? - Let's go! National Police. You are surrounded! Stop! His mobile. The lift! I was scared you'd be gone. I was scared you weren't coming. Did you get it all? - Yes. The coach has left. The next one is in 15 minutes. We can't travel like this. It's too risky. I'll put half in my bag and take half on my person. Hurry, the cops are coming.
