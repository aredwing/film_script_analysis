VACANCY There is in everyone's life choice. A fork in the road. The path of righteousness and a path of sin. For every action is a consequence ... and for each sin is a punishment. You have spurned the punishment and each trial ... and I pass one hand against the other ... and shall discharge the fury do, sir ... for I am His messenger ... and the Lord commanded. The Lord commanded. There is no one there. - What do you mean? - I do not know, is weird. I left the key on the table with some money. You left what we? - Yes, it must cover the expense. - Okay.

The Lord is merciful. The Lord is merciful. Help this woman, God. Tell me something about this woman. When she was fifteen years ... Amen Since then, almost all the years she required surgery. One year she had four. And they gave this medication pain ... but now it has become dependent on the medication. - That's what it takes? - Yes Who takes it? It takes two for nerves ... four sleeping pills and a dose of Demerol ... every night bedtime. I'm enjoying it this trip, Summer. What? I'm just saying I'm enjoying. - You changed the text. - Do not get me wrong ... I'm still not so to tell their parents. I'm just enjoying the journey much more than I thought it would. They will be happy. They stayed with Benny for two weeks ... be more willing to have more grandchildren. I know, but his father still will give me sermon on the responsibility. Clark a baby is not a toy ... the day comes when a man must face its responsibilities. He has good intentions. I know, but it is always the same conversation. Clark a house is not a toy. Clark a dog is not a toy. Clark a woman is not a toy. Well, he is casting his his own image. Ours that scary thought. Honey ... Baby, you okay? I do not know. Okay ...

I put the spare back in LA, darling. Then someone came and stole the spare tire, Clark? - I do not know, maybe. - Who steals a spare? I do not know, Summer, all I know is that I put the spare here. Damn, damn, damn! Please stay well, please, it's okay. Sorry, baby, sorry. Please stay well, please, it's okay. I promise you, I take her to a doctor, okay? I'll take it to be examined. Sure. You can see where we are? Yes, I could see. There is a town about eight, nine kilometers in this direction. As we walk eight, nine kilometers, Clark? Summer, listen ... the motel where we came is more than 80km beyond. The city is eight, nine kilometers in this direction. Well, I think we should be with the car? I mean, what if ... Summer, baby, we saw a car throughout the day. If we start to walk and we walk on this road ... and a car comes, he'll see us ... and will to the next town. - I do not know, Clark. - Baby, it's our only option. Okay? Okay. Okay, what's the name? Show me. Rivers of Blood. Great. Drugs. Okay. So what do we do? Let's walk. It seems to be 1000 C. I'm just saying ... I wanted to say something ... Is it broken? Not any more. Of course not. Of course not. You kidding? We're almost there. I promise you. Okay. That's right. Come on. Raising ... Support your arm on me. This. It is not fun? Clark? Thank God. Is anyone there? Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Nobody. Nobody. Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Hello? Is anyone there? You must be kidding me. All right, baby. Let's find some water. There's nobody here, Clark. Clark. Come here, baby. It's okay. Let's find something, okay? Hello? Where are you going, Clark? Clark? Clark? - It's okay. - No. .. - It's okay. - Not all is well. We will find a little water. Trust me. Trust me. It's okay. Come. Let's find something. Come. Clark. Yes? I worried with our baby. Come here, I am too. I am also, but it will be alright. How do you know? How do I know? Because we resolve this. We'll take her to a doctor and you will be examined. Listen to me. We have a little fighter in there, okay? He must be laughing now ... and wondering why your mother is so upset. God, I hope so. You only have to think positive, okay? I'll take a look around, see if I can find something. You stay here, okay? - Do not go away. - I will not. Okay? I will not take. Come on! Damn! Damn! Keep track, Clark. Keep control. Drugs. Clark. Clark? Clark? Clark? Clark? Clark? Clark? Clark? What happened? See. See. Wow, wait a minute. Are you kidding me? We thought we were alone out here. Sorry to disappoint them. Nice to meet you. You have no idea that it is good to see someone. Well, it's a great "welcome" a stranger. - What are you doing out here? - We had a car accident. We had a burst tire, the worst I've ever seen. And we do not have a spare tire. It is a bold man for driving the desert without a spare tire. - Actually I had ... - What is your name, traveler? Clark Ewald nice to meet you. Ewald, how to spell? As is pronounced ... and you are? Joseph ... how it is pronounced. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Joseph. Wow, look at you, are all injured. Well, we had to walk the car far, then ... Your baby is well? Yes .. I think so ... I hope so. So what is your story, Joseph? The old story running out of petrol. I saw this place on the map and started walking. I thought I would get some help here. Should not have gone to work is a ghost town. I see it now. There are holidays I had planned. No, not for us. We are across the state to visit my parents. Well, that's cool. Yes, if we get there. Well, I have to say ... I would not mind stop in the shade. It's hotter than a stand hot dog in hell, right? Yes, clear, will accompany him. I would offer you a drink or something to eat, but ... Allow me. I always carry a bottle of rum in my purse. You never know when you will encounter lost to Los Angeles. This kind of thing happens to you often? More often than you think. Take my bag, friends. What? Do not worry about me, friends. - Come on, Clark. - I'm going. Is the following ... I serve it for drinking. No, I should not. Accept a little water, if any. A water coming out. - This is good. - Thank you. You want me to take a look arm. I have some material. I'm fine, thanks. Well, if you change your mind. And the baby of you? I see you still worried. Would you mind if I ... Bright. It's okay, just relax. I felt something. You still have a glow about you. The baby is fine. Well, it's good to know. You hear that, Clark? I'm sitting right here. What is your next step, pal? Now know this place dead. It's a good question. I think back to the road and expect a car to pass. I can not believe we walk up here for nothing. Well .. I went up and down this road a few times. You may have to wait a good time. If you have a better idea I'd like to hear it. Well, it's too late now ... the sun will set. It will be dark before you know it. But I think in the morning, can go to his car ... take a little gasoline, bring to my'll take the road. Well, there are cars out there maybe we can check them out first. If gasoline this lot of rust ... then I'm Mary ... and that I'm not. There is a motel with a gas station Yes, I know, is where we came from. Well, this is the best I have. Yes, that sounds like a plan. Okay, then. Meanwhile it is better to light a fire. It's cold in the desert at night. What do you say, buddy? Let me get firewood? Of course, we do. Okay. Everything will be okay, honey? Yes, I will survive. Okay. - This wood is good. - Yes Listen ... be frank with me, what are our chances here? How so? What are our chances out of here? Of being rescued. - You want the truth? - Yes I'd say your chances are not large. Well .. I'll talk to my wife that all is well ... and certainly get out of here. And you do the same, okay? So will two liars, not? Yes, I think so. Do not get me wrong, still want to get out of here ... but until things change ... you and I will twist the truth a little. You do not have to explain to me. But must respond to Jesus. What? I'm just playing with you, dude. Understood. We have to stick together, right? That's right. Can I keep the secret also if you can. So that's what we do. To the grave. There is only one more thing. Say. I do not like people putting hands on my wife. If you do this again you and I have a problem. Yes, sir, you're the boss. I was just being nice. Cool, be nice otherwise okay? I do this. How are you, princess? Well, considering ... Owner not want to talk too much ... but her husband just ask me about our chances to get out of here. Really? Well .. He asked me not to say what I said to him ... but I think we in the same boat ... everyone deserves to know what's going on. Why he does not want you tell me? I do not know, maybe he has found you would panic. Panic? I think we all need to know the true situation. What's going on? Why do not you tell me, Clark? Say what, dear? About his conversation with Joseph just now. I just ... I did not want to worry, that's all. Well, now I wonder All conversations, okay? No secrets. It seems fair. What you say, Clark? No more secrets. Okay. No secrets. Listen ... know I never lie you. Just do not hide anything from me, Clark. Thanks again the food. No need to thank. This will be your first child? No, we have a son. Well, I have a son ... before Clark. His name is Ben. He has five years. Stepfather, that's cool. Five is a good age ... not lost to civilization up to five years ... - I still have some spirit. - What do you mean? - Your child goes to school? - Yes, of course. Learning to be a man. How to get a job, working for the man. Got a problem with that? Got a problem with the authorities? Here, a picture of Ben. It's a smart kid. And to answer your question, You ... there are only two authorities I know of ... I am one and the other, God ... and have no problem with any of them. You just do not think that children should be educated ... Clark. Okay, I'm just trying to understand what you are saying. All right, man. It's okay. Think as a smokescreen. You put the children schools ... so they do not know what is actually happening. They are using their fingers with mathematics and geography ... while the crap is falling over the rest of us. Well .. let me say this, will not always be so ... as long bury our heads in the sand. It's time to light the fire under the back of some people. You're a revolutionary. No, ma'am, I do not. I'm just the messenger. What is the message? Do not say you should never talk about politics? Absolutely. Politics and religion. You're a religious man, Clark? You are right that I can not try it? - No thanks, I'm sure. - This is the right answer. - Here. - Thank you. Well .. is a beautiful night. I swear, was the longest day. Well, I better get some sleep. Staying up is superficial. When you are sleeping you dream ... and is when you are dreaming that is when the truth comes. So where you live, Jo, where are you from? If you're asking where I put my head ... I'll tell where I can ... but if you ask where I live ... I'll say in my mind. A man can be king his own mind. But what is the advantage of being a king in his own mind ... if nobody cares? Clark! My Father cares. I was not talking you specifically. Suppose that, relatively speaking, in the grand scheme of things ... you and I are useless. But in your head you are a king, so what Big deal. What is the problem, Clark? You think you're useless? They do not listen to you? People do not respect him? People respect me. If people do not see me what should ... only means that will be the first to be burned ... when I lift in front of them. You really is a revolutionary. No. See, a revolution involves something that is going around. What I do have a defined beginning and a very definite purpose. And what you do, Joseph? What I want. I'm free as a bird. Anyway, I think the girl want to sleep a little ... and I suggest you do the same thing ... have a walk tomorrow soldier. Yes, you're right. Meanwhile I will "drain my lizard" then I will also rest. Sleep well we see in the morning. Yes, sleep well. Wow. - So, what do you think? - About what? About Joseph, cute. It's a little crazy but it seems a good guy. You think? Think. Do not you think? I do not know. He seems a bit strange. - He is just a free spirit. - Really? Yes, a "crazy beautiful" a hippie. No need to worry ... they are all "peace and love" baby. - Really? - Sure. I know many guys like him college. Of course yes. Not so. Now go to sleep. Good night, Clark. Clark ... What is the problem? You saw my picture of Benny? No, the last time I was Joseph when he showed last night. I returned it! I know. This is strange. I have put in my bag, but ... But what? I do not know, it's weird. I can not find it. Okay, must have lost inside. Let's find. Joseph, what time we leave? We? No, no, dear. You will stay here. What? - It will be very far and it's hot ... - But I do not want to stay here. He's right. You need rest, need to take care the baby she is carrying. I really do not want be left alone. I mean I'll be safe? It makes sense, face, can not leave it here. I need a man to help me. You are a man, right, Clark? She comes with us. It looks like it will anyway. "She" is right here! Darling, your car is in this direction. My car is there are eight, nine kilometers in this direction. It's a long walk for a pregnant lady. Especially someone as beautiful as you. Shall I leave them alone? You will not leave me here, Clark. So what do we do? Now, do not be alarmed, but ... I travel a lot and you can come find very strange types. I do not know I really do not like guns. Not me, ma'am. But if we leave it alone, at least can defend itself. Summer, he's right. Okay. Stand up, lady. Now, spread your legs. Joseph, what are you doing? I'll teach her how to use the piece. - Do you mind? - No. You are about to shoot a man or will make a salad? I'm about to shoot a man. Well, then, act as if shoot a man. Arm straight and strong. That, good. Now, there is no security. So if something happens, what will not, but if this happens ... you gun and pull the trigger, okay? Gun and pulls the trigger. Sure. That's good. Good Now think is not your man ... but it is a bad man truth. Arma ... Do not point that thing me. "Bang." The victim falls, end of the game. Justice was done. I understand. He's crazy. Listen ... Sorry get it to sound like. Okay. I'll be fine. Really? Is. I sit here and my brown ... and shoot anyone try to hurt me. This is my girl. Listen ... we soon we can ... but still be a few hours, so do not worry, okay? Okay. You're ready, cowboy? Absolutely. Just do not delay, okay? Do not linger. I promise. If you're lucky will be driving. It is here, purple pants. It is a good start. I love you. We are just you and me now, Junior. What was that? What do you mean? Do you think it is smart to point a loaded gun at someone? Well, it all depends on who is. Well, you pointed a loaded gun for me, smart guy. What is the problem, Superman? You can not dodge a bullet? Just do not give me another way, okay? This is bad enough ... I need you acting strange like I need a hole in the head. It will be a fun ride. Believe me I'm enjoying more than you. We can at least try ... Once you get to my car and manage the fuel ... which is the distance to yours? Far. Sure. I forgot, Mr. Prince. You have to stop it, dude. Concentrate your mind what we are doing ... and not how long it will take or how difficult it will be. It's very hot here. I should have brought his sandals, dude. Have you noticed how the only people that really sweat ... and I mean really sweat ... are the sons of a bitch who can not stop complaining about the heat? I can not say I've noticed. I mean, you see a drop of sweat on me, cowboy? I'm from the city. I'm not used to it. Everything, and I mean everything, is a state of mind, man. Really? What about death? If you do not tidy up this car, we learn. I know one thing, she comes to us all. There is no point crying about it ... and certainly does not make sense cry about it before. Wow! - What is funny? - You, man. You are like a box of fortune cookies or something. Not believe it. You are very close, is restricted. You need to drop a little. You say that like met me. I know, boy. I know him. You have a job In ... is very well paid ... wears a suit and tie, makes you feel important. But in mid-afternoon on a hot day, you unbutton the top button, right? His concession to society. Your badge of honor. Undid the top button, I have worked hard today. You never had a day working hard in your life ... never worked until blood and the sweat run down into the mud ... - Staining their shoes. - I see a lot of sweat ... The rest of the world is struggling and debating ... fighting, settling and crying ... blood, shit, sperm and tears flying through the air ... knocking on his face. Only you do not see, man. You do not see. Because you sits in his tower ... where their shutters down to protect him from the pain of the world. You see, I know. I know you, pilgrim. Because sometimes, you see much when it is buried in the mud ... than when sitting in his office on the 12th floor. My office actually is on the 12th floor. You see ... I told him. I know him. You define your paths. You, hippies. I will not pretend that I agree with them, but ... Hear what he says, Mr. America. I'm not a hippie. It's the way I see and the things I say ... is a reflection of their society, and ideals. The only truth is here in my mind. I'm not a hippie, man. And you can be sure that in my mind, fire up their cities. About the devil ... you have to know the truth of the scriptures. Our ... How long is with your wife? Why do you ask about my wife? I'm just trying to talk, trying to be friendly. Are married and six months before marriage. It has a good set. A beautiful wife, a baby on the way, a big house ... bet, two cars, not? Yes, I am very lucky. I think some people just do not know how lucky you are. How? Well .. not believe that a real person, Clark. You know nothing about me. I know a little. What are you talking about? I just know its type, is all. Funny ... At first I called him a hippie, remember? And you referred me to his sermon of how the world is unfair. Now you're telling me you know my type? I'm not talking on how to dress ... or the work you have, or people he meets. I'm talking the man inside. His soul. You are totally crazy know that? I could say the same thing about you. The only difference is I looked in his mind. You know nothing about me ... then we cut the crop, okay? Okay ... but the truth appear at the end. You can not hide forever. If you do not deal with it the truth will put you on your knees. Yeah, and he alone, whose heart is pure, I do not know what else ... You are bothering me with this thing. This is probably guilty. This ends with a man. There is a way back ... just have to know when to take it. Thank you. I'll remember that. Hippie ... Hello? Hello? Thousands in the world today are being dominated, influenced, controlled ... and driven by demons, without actually being possessed by them. A person can be so overwhelmed and vexed by demons ... is not really different to be possessed by them. Some people are so connected demonic powers ... Is there anybody there? They are not themselves. Devils may cry or cry with voices ... using their lips and tongue. Demons can torment people ... and may, in turn, be tormented by people. It is a known fact a legion of demons ... may be in a person the same time. How many of you will laugh? I say that demons can preach and they do. Demons can tell lies, and do you believe and tell lies. Demons can make you a thief according to the word of God. They can arise, floor and need rest. All this is founded the scriptures. It is quite possible that at some time in the past ... you had your fortune read by a demon. Once a demon spear a boy on fire to destroy it. It will also launch the water for the same purpose. Demons ... Hello? Hello? Hello? Use in moderation, dude. Thank God we did. Of course we can. Just a walk in the park. I hope Summer is well. She's fine. But it should be more concerned with their own situation. What do you mean? Things are not always what they seem. Shame on you, if someone let the bones out of the closet. What? Everyone has a secret Clark. I wonder what is yours. You want to share with me? You do not know me, man. Okay. You really did a number about it. I open the lid of the tank. You have traveled the path with me this day. You had the opportunity of confession and repentance and you rejected it. His only hope now is telling the truth. But you will not. No, you will not. So be it. His penance awaits. I'm getting tired of ... Hello? Hey. What? Ben? Clark. God! God! Benny! God! What's happening? Where's Clark? He will come. What is this place? That's where the sinner comes to die. You did that? Honey, these people did it to themselves. Do not approach me. How ironic, is not it? Are you afraid of me now. Can not wait her prince ... back to the city and save. But the thought is at odds with the truth. What are you talking about? Man you love ... is much more dangerous than you or me. He sinned. All he likes will be crushed. All that love will be punished. No. I'm afraid so. God! Get away. Stay away. You cried for the weak ... but they chose their own way. They decide their fate when cheat, steal, lie and fornicate. When you take a life or steal a purse ... or look for his friend's wife eyed cobiantes. His actions ... their lies weaknesses ... sins. Clark ... Clark is a good person. No! No! You're a good person. No. But it is weak ... and blind. I promise I'll raise the scales. 'll Shine the light ... the Lord in every crevice. I light every shadow. The light will shine in the darkness. Everyone will know the truth finally. No! Voc .. have faith in God, Summer? Do you believe in God? Yes So if comfort in knowing that everything What happens here is His will. And only Him. Look at you. You are beautiful. Is an angel. Damn! Damn! Drugs, Summer! Summer! Summer! Do not worry, are not for you. This is for you. No, no! Please! No need to do this. No! Yes I do. I'm just the bearer. It is my will. No! The life grows within you. Innocent of the sins of the father. It belongs to me, more than you. It's as if I myself had planted the seed. No, no, no. No! It is my son now. No! No! Can you feel me? You can not do that. No. It's time to leave dad bravo. No, no. No. You've been betrayed. And it will take this brand until the end of his days ... not to forget. Now you can scream. Clark! Clark! Come! Summer! Here he comes. Summer! Summer! Clark? Clark? Summer? Clark! Honey? Summer? God! Darling. It's all right, all right. Bastard! Bastard! What caused it? I'll kill you! Your unborn child ... belongs to me now. This is even necessary, man? As we get out? You know even use it? Shut up. Why? If not I will kill you! You can not kill me. You can not kill me. I am not of this world. You created this monster. You even asked for it. Welcome to the revolution, man. There is no revolution, stupid! We are just you and me now. There is nothing special about you. Like all the other useless and vagabonds out there ... too busy with his poetry gay to get a job ... or take a damn shower! Now ... you will tell me everything I need to know, Joe ... because it is so the world works. Okay. Want to talk? Let's talk. Yes, I would love to talk. Who are you? I'm an angel. Sent to Earth by a just God ... to punish the weak with the flaming sword of vengeance. This is your day. It's your turn to be judged. Judged by what? Really want me to say? Great! - I do not know who is speaking. - You know, yeah, man! Yes, you! I see in your face. You feel it. Every hour of every day every time. When I see your eyes poisoned and no soul, I feel your pain, man! I feel your pain! - Scroll through my veins. - Shut up! It is my curse. It's my curse, man! What are you talking about? "Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing. For they are ravening wolves "! What? - Stay out of it, Summer. - Clark? Stay out. Take care of it! Yeah, you can handle it. Please take good care, is not, buddy? I think not. You do not care about anything. You are about to discover that there are some things that can not control. Really? Really? I think it will be very easy tied with you in that chair! Do not commit more sins, man! It will only bring more disgrace for yourself! So I think I will be a fucking bastard, is not it? Now you tell me everything I need to know. As I go from here? Clark, no. No! - Clark, no. - Let me go! - You can not do that! - Let me go! Here comes the devil. As I go from here? As I go from here? As I go from here? As I go from here? You have no idea who I am. Pilgrim, have no idea who I am! No! No! What did he do to you? I just want to go home. There must be a way out of here. He must have a car or something. Clark, you cut his finger! What happened to you? I have to go further, Summer. No! Look at me. This is our only chance out of here. Okay? Okay. But deliver us from all evil. Hail Mary, Mother of God, pray for us ... - Wake up. - Amen Wake up, asshole. Now there is nothing which does not you to leave. So if you value your life useless tell me what I need to know ... and all this can stop. Why would I want to to stop? All it has a consequence. That's why we're here. Welcome to your hell! As well, is why we are here? The tire blew! It was pretty ugly, right? You did that? No matter who, or how, or when. The only thing that matters is that you are here. Here for what? Do not talk to him, Summer. Do not listen. Your husband is not what it seems. Do not talk to her. Do not say a word for it! He is one of the bad guys! Shut up! Not even Clark? Listen, you and I are talking, you tell me how to get out of here. I have said all I can. Only you can ask for forgiveness. Only you can get repentance. But you will not. With each breath, you add layer upon layer ... sin upon sin. I could not tell the truth even if he tried! He told his wife what he found in the car? Shut up! Damn! What does he mean? Tell her, Clark. Do not hold back. What he is talking about, Clark? I do not know what he's talking about. - Now you have two secrets. - Clark! I do not know! Damn! I will not hesitate this time. You can not kill me, man! You have no idea than I am able! I know exactly what you are capable, but can not kill me ... but will not leave. Where is your car? Where is your car? I'm not joking this time! All right, man ... you got me. I'll take it from here ... but I take it a place before. That's going to be. Take us where? Take us where? I show you everything. At the River. All answers are on river. Then you can kill me. If what you want. If it is what you want. I do not know, do not. Okay, I'm in control. Up! Walk. Why took my picture Benny? - Do not talk to him, Summer. - Ask him. You and I have nothing to say each other, then keep walking. Really. You do not like to talk, like, Clark? - Have you talked to Benny? - Did what? Sorry about that. What he is talking about, Clark? What about Ben? I do not know what he's talking about.
