While covering up all the evidence including things about myself, David Park, the BrindeI developed imperfect vaccine and make a enormous profit through the exclusive sale. Also they developed a drug called Zombie High which made from body fluid of zombies and made more profit by supplying the drug to international terrorists After escaping from the Brindel, I carried out researches on the vaccine conducting numerous experiments on my body. As a result of that, my lung became emitting toxic gas and my body became incurable zombie state. Finally I succeeded to make a right vaccine Now l, myself, will shut down the door of this hell which I had created. It's been a while to talk to you. We found the trace of Dr. Park in the restricted area. It seems that He is meeting with some members of the doctors without borders there.
