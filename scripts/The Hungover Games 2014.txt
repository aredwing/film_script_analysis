What are you talking about? Me and Doug are about to get married and I havent heard from him in two days. Things got a little out of control last night and we... We lost Doug. The wedding is in a few hours! In Santa Barbara? Yeah! Thats not gonna happen. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Look, I know everyones a little miffed we couldnt do Vegas this year, but lm telling you, Chief Loose Slots is the next best thing. I dont care where we have my bachelor party, guys. All that matters is that were celebrating together. And that we dont have AIDS. Anyway, I bet once you get inside, its not so bad. (BEEPS) All right! Hey, its cute. I am honestly impressed by how shitty this is. You dont even need a blacklight to see all the stains. Maybe thats yogurt. Nah, it says right here in the pamphlet, it is semen. Look, semen or no semen, the important thing is that Doug found his soulmate. DOUG: Thanks, man. Tracey just completes in me, you know? Did you say, Completes in you? (GROANS) You know, that reminds of the love shared between Peeta and Katniss in The... lm gonna need you to stop talking about that book. No, I will not stop talking about a novel that blogcritics. Orglreviews said was a page-turner.  Have you even read it? Ld love to, man. Its just hard to find time to enrol in 7th grade and cut off my nuts. Well then, maybe lll find it hard to find time to share my goodies. Oh, nice. What do you got in there? Lve got all kinds of fun stuff. I have Chernobyl potato vodka, standard-issue roofies, lve got Chinese black tar heroin, lve got drug mule rectum-release opium, and some plug-in air fresheners. How did that get in here? All right. You got any bath salts? Tons. Help yourself. Lve also got skunk, scoot, snap, flippers, flappers, floppers, uppers, downers, and cyanide chewables. Cyanide? Poison is the best. Hey! Those are my fun-time candies! No. Uh-uh. Every time we go out, we end up blacked out and looking for somebody. Vegas. Thailand. My nephew Rubens Bar Mitzvah. Whatever, we got him back in time for the service. Yeah, and then he puked all over the Torah. (CHUCKLES) Classic. No, not classic. That is a holy document. (GROANS) All right, lets just get Zach dressed and head to the roof. Dressed? Small request, you guys. Could somebody scratch my nuts? I respectfully decline. Non-alcoholic beer? I told you. No risks tonight. Pussy! Excuse me, I was calling you a pussy. All right. Lets put our shitty rehab beers up and toast Doug and Tracey. I never thought your soulmate would have an Adams apple and a penis, but, hey, lifes a journey, I guess. Were happy for you, man. Thanks, guys. To Doug and Tracey. BOTH: To Doug and Tracey. And to a night well never forget. Those look really good. Could you just pour it in my cone? (GROANS) What the fuck? Oh, God. (GROANING) What? Scuba guy on the ceiling. That makes sense. Watch out! Jesus! You stepped on my balls, dude. Sorry. Where the hell are we? Fuck if I know. All I know is I am hungover as shit right now. I think lm legally dead. And my mouth tastes assy. Please tell me I ate cheese. I dont know. My ass kind of hurts. Oh, no! Did I do cocaine? Lm deathly allergic to cocaine. And lm allergic to gluten. ED: I hope thats gluten-free. Oh, no. Did we kill Waldo last night? Um... Maybe he was fucked to death. (GAGGING) (IN SING-SONG VOICE) Morning, fellas! Oh, god damn it, who let Zach out of the straitjacket? Is that a man-thong? No, its a regular thong. I wear them all the time. Thats disgusting. (GAGGING) Okay, we need to find Doug and get the hell out of here. Somebody call him. Wheres my phone? Oh, holy shit. Is this a rocket launcher? BRADLEY: Zach? Dude! Come on, we have to find Doug. But that was... Oh, my. Gentlemen, this is quite a mess. Okay, this is awkward, but lm just gonna go ahead and ask, maid or hooker? Manners! That is no way to speak to your escort. I always ask. The answers always the same. Its been real nice talking to you, but were just gonna go. I wouldnt do that. Okay. (SCREAMING) Were on a fucking train? I knew it! That means youre Effie Trinket! No, my name is Effing. And the three of you are on your way to the Games. We discussed this all after your courageous gesture. EFFING: Why dont you look at your phone? (CHATTER ON VIDEO) Fucking Reaping, bitches! ED: Oh, thats my phone. Let me see it. Dougs trying to kiss me again! Doug, how you doing, buddy? Fucking Reaping, bitches! (ALL WHOOPING) The first name ofthe girl... Why is Lady Gaga on the screen?

Haymitch! Thats not my name, you scruffy half-tard. Its Justmitch. Look, lm enjoying all of this. I really am. Especially that little blonde schoolgirl situation youve got going on right there. But right now we really just need to find our friend and be on our way. The Sponsors will eat that bromance shit up with a spoon. Speaking of which. Okay, let me guess, now youre gonna tell us how to win the Games? If you wanna live long enough to find your pansy little friend, youd best learn to listen to me. If theres two things I know, its hangovers and murdering for sport. And, hey, if youre lucky enough, one of yall might get out of here alive. Did you just say one of us? Mm-hmm. Now if youll excuse me, I gotta find a vein. WOMAN ON TV: You're watching Capitol Sports. Skip, its my favourite time of the year. The weather is warming, the tig ol bitties is coming out and right now, its time for the Hungover Games! A great competition shaping up this year. Contestants from the Superheroes District and the Middle Earth District are once again among the favourites. The Puppet District and the Depp District are particularly intriguing to Stephen A. Timplesmith. Johnny Depp. Is there any weirdo this guy wont play? Straight freak! Next up, we have The Real Housewives ofDistrict 8. Now these trashy bitches have about a 0% chance of surviving the Games. White girls! Got me one at home. Next up, weve got the Django District. Now Django is tough, but lets get this straight, Skip.

Lets go! I have the power! Come on, cunt. Oh, foo. Another year, another murder. What a crop of freakazoids. (GRUNTING) Stop swinging that in my face. That is dangerous. That is not a toy! Zach, will you stop? Youre making us look like idiots. No, Mr I Cant Even Pick Up This Boulder. (YELLING) Youre making us look bad in front of the Sponsors. Why are they all dressed like that? Looks like a Lady Gaga family reunion. Look, you see that? Our odds are pretty shitty right now. ED: Hey, why do the puppets have better odds than us? Go ahead and cross check your information. Excuse me. Sorry, I hate to bother you with this, but my friend is stuck. World War Z, right? No. Walking Dead, actually. Oh, right, right. You were the one that bit that guys ear and then ate his face off, right? Guilty. So who else came from your district? Just that crazy blood-covered bitch over there. She scares the shit out of me. I can see why. Wow. Kaptain Kazakhstan is really rocking that burlap sack. Look at the size of those Oompa Loompas. Youre welcome. Thats quite a bit of shrubbery he has down there. Can you say, Ch-Ch-Ch-Chia? (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Listen. Theyre looking at you like youre a meal. Especially that flamboyant Scandinavian guy. Ew. He wants to roll you in sugar like a dick churro. So what am I supposed to do? They need to know that you can take a punch. What? Yeah. Trust me. Okay. (GROANING) (GIGGLING) Okay, lm good. All right, lm good. The elbow didnt count. Come on, come on.

Lm a talking jay, you birdbrain. For a nerd, youre pretty dumb. Sorry. Hes really nice once you get to know him. Yeah, just ask your mom. Thats rude. Go away. How are you feeling, by the way? Well, besides the raging hangover, the free-for-all death match coming up, and the shit taste I cant get out of my mouth, lm actually doing great. Hey, look, its Dumb and Dumberer. A talking jay. So elegant. Hey, get your mitts off me! Whered you go to school, Penn State? Wow, okay, yeah. Lm not even gonna try to process that right now. Excuse me? Lts Katnip, Bradley. We met last night. Yeah, Bradley. Yeah, right, okay. About last night, do you have any idea what happened to our friend, Doug? Uh... (LAUGHING) No. But I did wake up today and I saw you all volunteered. That was really brave of you. That is one word for it. No, seriously. You guys were talking about it so much you inspired me to do it. Thats why I took my little sisters place. That was stupid. Sorry. You have a little sister? Is she into husky bearded guys with low-level personality disorders? (YELLING) Nice! I like this girl. That got more hand than apple. (BUZZER RINGS) Attention, battlers, battlers, battlers. The training centre is now closed. It is time to die. Make that work. Thats my catchphrase, you know. Make that work.  WOMAN: Hello?

MAN OVER PA: Now the contestants line up before the Pornucopia, no doubt picking out the weapons they wanna grab. Doug, Doug, come on, man. Where are you? He must be on the other side of that tent full of... What are those? Sex weapons? ED: Where the fuck are we? MAN: This is a great time to mention that the weaponry has been provided by Delta Venus, Queen ofthe Sex Toys. (DRUMS POUNDING) Let the killing begin! Shit, come on!

Bag, bag, bag! Please stop. Just please stop. Wait, you want some fucking lemon? Yeah, bag it up! Come on! Jesus! I know that looked bad, but, come on, lets keep in mind that the purpose of this competition is to kill people, yeah. So that was technically not a hate crime. Lm not a racist. I got like eight black guys on my fantasy football team. I mean, not the quarterback obviously, thats a thinking mans position. Seriously? (SHUDDERS) Oh, no, not this! Fuck this! Go! Whatever. (ALL GROAN) Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! I just watched Django get kerb-stomped by a teddy bear, two of our friends are MIA, and, oh, did I mention, did I mention this, that my mouth still tastes like shit! All right, dude, quit being a baby. My ass still hurts, too. You dont hear me whining about it. It just wont go away. BOTH: Oh! Whats happening, honkies? What the hell? That Asian guy! Really? What? Oriental man cannot practise acrobatics in the woods? You racist assholes think lm Viet Cong or something? Wait, why the fuck are you here? We had a sick night last night. I still hungover. Just tell us what the fuck happened, okay? You mean you dont remember? No. Human Centipede, bitches! Whats a Human Centipede? Human Centipede only the greatest idea ever.

You know what they say, early to bed, early to Human Centipede. I gotta go Human Centipede with the Olsen twins. Theyve done it before. See you gay boys later. Lets find a place to sleep, buddy. Its been a long day. Oh, Jesus! I didnt eat corn. Yeah, I did. (GROANING) Shit, human shit inside me. Hey, man, weve all been there. Really? Fuck, no, lve never been there. Its the most disgusting thing lve ever heard. (CRYING) It is real gross. Hey, shit-for-breath, be quiet for a second. Look over there. Someones got a fire going. Thats dumb. Yup. MAN: I appreciate the spirited conversation, gentlemen, but we all know theres no debate. I am the weirdest of all the Depps. I mean, for fucks sake, lm a pirate who sashays round like a bloody poof. And what of you there, top hat? Well, I do have my fair share of psychological issues. My speech patterns mirror those of sexual molesters. I keep a bunch of dwarves as my slaves. And I masturbate in the chocolate. (GIGGLES) Every single batch. I think I might puke. (WHISTLES) Nice work, Tonto. Say good night, weirdos. A bloody smoke signal! You fucked us, you bloody Native! Tonto sick of white man. Yes, but were all Depps, mate! Tonto especially sick of Depps. Are you gonna rape and murder us? TEDDY: Keep it in your pants, Scissorhands. Me next! Me next! If you dont mind, I prefer it in a chocolate factory. Thats brutal. Now thats what I call a deep throat. That means a dozen gone in the first eight hours, Stephen A., and I think I smell an alliance forming. What the fuck do you mean, an alliance? If its supposed to be every man for themself, they aint gonna create no fucking alliance. Theyre gonna be out there killing each other. That dont make no goddamn sense! I know. I can barely keep myself from killing you, Stephen A. Cant fault you there. THOR: That creepy, pale guy was bananas! B-A-N-A-N-A-S! TEDDY: Hey, Thor, we get it. You like cock. Fuck, dude. Dont stay here, dont stay here, dont stay here. Anyway, guys, lm pooped. What say we just stay here for the night? ZACH: Do you guys think theres a Chilis out here? Lll settle for an Applebees, but it would be grudgingly. What the fuck is he doing with them? I think hes looking for a reasonably priced casual dining restaurant. Thor? Awesome Blossom? Tonto? Jalapeno poppers? Something for you, Bloody? If you talk to me again, I will murder your whole family and terrorise whatever little Podunk town you come from, you hear me? Okay, more fully loaded potato skins for me then. How about a bear claw? Maybe a bun for the wiener? All right, table for six, seven. Ladies? You know, I dont think we fit the dress code. Oh, its a Chilis. You guys will be fine. I kill him now, yes? No. Lets lock him in a burning gymnasium and wait till his guttural screams slowly fade away. TEDDY: Easy, Scary. We need to keep that fat sack of Aspergers alive for now. Hes our best shot at finding those two other fuck nuggets. Would you guys shush already? I need to get my beauty sleep. (GROANS) Lm never gonna be able to sleep now. Lm gonna have insomnia for sure. (SIGHS) This was the worst day ever. (SNORING) What the... Shit! Jesus! Shut up, Ed. Got hit with a fucking boulder. Hey! She seems friendly. What are you nodding at? I dont... Use your fucking words! She wants us to saw the hive off so that it falls onto them below. GIRL: No fuckin shit. Vulgar little child. Oh, I have a Swiss Army knife. Okay. Uh, hey, you know, lm not really athletic. Do you mind just climbing up there? Take one for the team? Come on. Nice. Oh, snap! Now looky here. Them motherfucking hungover honkies got a trick up their sleeve. Is that a Swagger Jacker nest, Skip? Correct, you are. Now these guys are gonna have to be careful. Swagger Jackers are no ordinary bees. They are genetically engineered wasps that when they sting you, they drain your bodys natural swagger supply. In other words, they make you a straight bitch. Precisely. And just a few stings can prove lethal. Lm crossing my fingers, Skip. Me, too. I know you arent trying to cut down our nest! Does that hurt? Yes, it hurt! Dude, dont be a pussy. Saw! (SNORING) Oh, God. Theyre not gonna sleep in much longer. Hurry up, man! (SWAGGER JACKERS CHATTERING) Hurry up! Get away from the nest, jerk-off! TEDDY: Flew in my fucking hole! (SHRIEKING) TEDDY: Oh, shit! Got a bee in my cock. (ALL SCREAMING) Oh, Jesus. Hey, you okay? A couple of Swagger Jack-offs stung me. (SLURRING) But lm good. Hey, hey, hey, sure? You dont look too good. I dont feel too good. No, no, no, no! Bradley! Lm coming for you! You guys see that? (SCREAMING) Shit! Shit! This chubba has literally no swag. Hey! I was looking all over for you guys! (ALL GROANING) BRADLEY: God, my face hurts. Oh, I can feel my heartbeat in my ears. Its throbbing. Its really loud. Hey. Does my head look weird? Lts so loud. No. But your body is super tiny. It is? Your body is super tiny, man. Do I look okay? Yeah. Youre cool. I am cool, thank you. This is napping cool time for me. (GROANS) This is a terrible pillow. Sleep sounds good. Hi. Lve missed you. Lve missed you, too, Katnip. Lm only 17. What? Nothing. I have something to show you. ED: Yes. Yes. No! Why? Hey, are you having a wet hallucination, Ed? Yeah, you know, a nocturnal emission? God, just when I thought I couldnt hate you any more. Hey, ease up. We didnt choose this way of life. Yeah, its no picnic. You know how hard it is to motorboat yourself? God, please dont do it. This is the worst wet dream of my life. See? Zach, how can you even ruin boobs? Hey, does my mouth look like a nipple? Uh... It kinda does. Okay, this is getting weird. Maybe we should wake him up. Okay, okay, okay. On my count. One, two, three! BOTH: Boom! Bearded boobies! (SHOUTING) How long have we been out, man? Couple days. Lve been licking your wounds. What? Lve been watching you guys sleep, nursing you back to health. Scrotal touching was just for medicinal purposes. We saw those Swagger Jackers sting you, man. A lot. Yeah, but their venom has no effect if you have no swagger to jack. Hold on a second. What the hell were you doing with that gang, man? You were gonna help them kill us? You guys, I dont do well with peer pressure. I didnt really want to murder you. But you would have? Oh, come on! Lm sorry! I had a moment of weakness! I nursed you back to health. Dont you feel swaggy? Yeah. Yeah. I really do, actually. Its because of this. Swagger Balm. lngredients, aloe, palm oil, and Kanye West extract?  Tastes just like the real thing. (GAGGING) WOMAN: Hey, boys. We thought we smelt some swagger. Puts the rocks down, buddy. (WHOOPING) I just wanna get sloppy drunk and slutty! Way too late for that, sweetheart. I get the blondes. Okay. Thats rich! So then I divorced that asshole and took half of everything. Thats how I got my lucky charm. Is it that ring? Lts lovely. Lm not talking about that. Lm talking about this. (LAUGHING) Is that a fucking ball? Neat! I told you, when I took half of everything, I meant half of everything. You girls are such a treat. Great! Heres to good friends! And you two bitches. Well, well, well, if it isnt the popular girls. Nice blood outfit, honey, but thats worse than pleather. What is that, O positive? Awful. So last season. What is that, gas? You got that on my Gucci dress! Bitch! What are you doing? Do you know how much this cost? Wait, I just wanna see where this is going! Zach, lets go! Game, set... No! No! ...match! (ALL SCREAMING) WOMAN: My tits are gonna melt! You wanted to see me, President Snowbama? Tell me, have you ever been hungover? Why, yes. Lm actually hungover right now. Never pass out in a crowded bar. Yes, they shaved a dick on my face, sir. These hungover contestants, people seem to care about them. Yes? Is that a bad thing, sir? The Games are a distraction so people wont notice the crap we peddle out. Sequels, remakes, spoofs. When people start to care, bad things happen. Ratings go down, beards get shaved. Lve got it under control, sir. Its a kitty cat. Cause youre a little pussy. Thank you, Mr President. (CANNON BLAST) Shit! Any one of these cannon blasts could be Doug. We dont even know if hes still alive. Hey, lm scared, too, but the one thing thats not gonna get us back to that gay wedding is sitting here crying about it. There should only be a handful of contestants left. We can do this, man. You guys. Hey, since were standing around sharing things, lve got a doozy. What the hell did you do, Zach? You know the air fresheners that I plugged in? Best thing you ever did. They were delightful. Well, it wasnt Lilac or Morning Mist or Brazilian Breeze. It was Midnight Berry. What the shit is Midnight Berry? From the novels. Its aromatic. Whats so bad about that? Well, I didnt finish my thought. Its aromatic, poisonous and lethal. What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you kidding me? I think you guys are getting hung up on the fact that its poisonous and lethal. They smell fresh. Smell. Jesus! Fuck, man! God! (GROANS) Yeah, it says right here on the label, May cause transportation to futuristic dystopia.  May.  Youre the reason were here, you sausage-fingered fuck! This is all your fault! Hey, you said you liked the scent! Because I like floral scents! Well, there, he said it! So now I forgive you guys and we can move forward! I... Ooh! I hope you die out here. No. You fucked up. That was harsh. The sloth is heading towards the soup pot. Over. MAN: 10-4, squaw without bra. Nice. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Real nice. Stupid Midnight Berry! Why does something so fragrant have to be so bad? (SIGHS) Thank God, thank God. Thank God. (WOMEN GIGGLING) Get outta the way. Get outta the way. Yeah, thats more like it. There. I thought ld never say this, but Daddy wants blue balls. MAN OVER PA: Attention, everyone. Attention. We have some new rules for you kids. From this point forward contestants of colour will be granted special consideration. Yes, lm talking about affirmative action, people. Zach! It's the 21st century... (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Whatever you say. I think I speak for all of us when I ask you to give us some privacy. With pleasure. WOMAN: Boys, have at him. Nice weave, bitch. Her hair is all natural. Take that back! You wanna kill her, you gotta kill me first. (SCREAMS) Blue scalp. Rarest of scalps. Your turn, dumpy. Yeah! Gratuitous nudity no match for gratuitous violence. Farewell, my princess. (CRYING) Maybe just one more squeeze. Go in a bit tighter. What the hell is he doing? Nothing on three. I dont know. Oh, no. Oh, no. Vivian, would you please get IT in here? Oy vey. What up, bitches? You fix computers? Hell yeah! I may be sociopathic gangster, but lm still Asian, motherfuckers! What? No, no, no, I really dont think you should be messing around with... Finished! Excellent. Thank you. Were back up, people. Oh, come on, Zach! That not cool. (LAUGHING) Excuse me. You may leave now. What, I get no tip? No. I take cash, credit, no cheque. But lll take a bump of coke. All right, get the hell out of here. Chop-chop! (SIGHS) What to do, what to do? You wanna get the ratings up? I got one word for you, bromance. Thats not a real word. You wanna give these districts a story? Well, you need to keep these guys together. Not separate. Hmm. I got one word for you, heroin. Heroin is the one word? No. Lm just really looking for some. You holding? Lm sorry. I got one word for you, dicksauce. Dicksauce? Dicksauce is the one word? You cant buy that shit. Well, thank you. Your time here has been so valuable. (SHOUTS) Bromance. Hmm. (PANTING) Hey, hey, hey. Is that water? Fuck it, lm thirsty as hell! Dont put your mouth on that. Its gross. Do you think its filtered? Really? I only drink bottled water. Didnt you just have shit in your mouth? All right! Fine! I didnt intentionally have shit in my mouth. It tastes a lot like blood, though. (SPITTING) What? MAN OVER PA: Check, check. Hot mic. Hot mic. Attention, everyone. Attention. There has been a change in the rules. Yes, from now on, multiple victors may be crowned ifthey survive the Games and share a long-standing bond of exceptional male bromance. They can do that? Yes, I am allowed to do this. I can do whatever the fuck I want, lm a motherfucking Gamesman! Noted. So good luck to you all and may the probabilities be ever to your liking. So that means we can all get out of this alive. All we have to do is find Doug and Zach! Zach! Zach! Zach! BRADLEY: Were sorry, buddy! Zach! Where are you, man? You dropped your glasses. Hey, quick question. If they can just change the rules at any time, why dont they just pick who they want to win and make it happen? This is confusing to me. Dont worry about it, man. Its just a plot hole. Hold on a sec. What? Zach said they used these birds to find each other in the book. Like by whistling to them. Hmm. Worth a shot. (WHISTLING) Yeah, that worked. Shut up. All right, one more time. Damn it. Sure, lll help. (BOTH WHISTLING) TALKING JAY: Suck my bird cock! Come on! Really? Marco! Marco! We dont have time for this! Marco! Why couldnt you just say, Polo? There you are. Listen, not that I give a hoot, but your fat friend Zachs about a half mile away from here with Katnip. How do you know? A little birdie told me. And by a little birdie, I mean a chickadee who gave me a beakjob. You want to find this overgrown garden gnome? Yeah. And Katnip. And stop fucking yelling, man. TALKING JAY: Anyway, thats why lm not allowed to go near schools any more. Good to know. Yeah! You guys! Oh, my God! I missed you guys so much! Yeah. Okay. Wheres Katnip? Shes over there. Youve got the talking jay! Sorry, Bradley, but this guy just made me crap down your shirt. Everything he says is so foul! Yeah, he says disgusting stuff. Come on! Where are we going? Fuck. Ooh. Maybe I should tell her lm... No, no, I should not. (SIGHS) Wow, yeah, this is not... This isnt pervy at all. Yes, it is. Hey! Perverted ass cracker! Hey! Trees are nice here. Ed! Oh, my God, youre okay! Hey! Oh... Um, that is a respect boner. A boner achieved out of respect. Um... You know lm 17, right? La, la, la! What? I cant hear you! It just got real loud in here! Hey, guys, hey. Hi. No sign of Doug? Nope. Nothing. Wait a minute. He came with your district. You were the last one to see him at the arena. Do you have any idea where he went? Well, do you feel like telling us? Okay, lve had about enough of this. Hey, hey, hey, come on! Thats like a triple hate crime. Hey. Theyre just looking for their friend. Do you want to tell them? For me? (ALL EXCLAIMING) You got Norsed! Shit! What the hell is wrong with you? Oh, shit! (ALL EXCLAIMING) That took a while. Who wants to go get margaritas? What the frick do we do now? I dont know, Zach, its been a while since lve had to battle the God of Thunder! Hey, blondie! Pick on someone your own size! (CHOKING) Yeah! Nice shot, Ed! I just killed a god. Did you guys see... Oh, shit. Hey. You okay? Come on, wake up. Youre a doctor, right? You can help her. Lm a dentist. Check her teeth. ZACH: # Ave Maria ZACH: # Ave Maria # Gratia plena # You guys wanna hear some Wu-Tang? She was so young. What a waste. There, buddy. She had so much ahead for her. Her first kiss. Her first handjob. Her first bukkake. Unless you guys wanna give her a send-off. No. Wow. Shes at peace. Or in some dark, endless abyss. Wait. We need to pay our respects. With a salute. Two in the pink. One in the stink. ALL: Forever. Can I ask you a serious question? Yeah, anything, man. Which ones the pink and which ones the stink? Because theyre both pinkish. And they both stink. Yeah. Remember when I told you to ask me anything? Forget I said that. You dont know, do you? MAN OVER PA: Hello. Attention, everyone. Attention. It is my profound pleasure to invite you all to a feast! Feast? And this will be no ordinary occasion. We know that you all want something and you want it bad. And we are aiming to be very generous hosts. Now, there will be some weapons available, but I strongly suggest that you all BYO weapon. Because I don't wanna get blamed ifwe run out like the last time. That was embarrassing. Oh! I also really need someone to bring ice. I had a sign-up sheet at the Reaping. Nobody fucking chose ice. Whats the big deal? Come on, somebody. Be a rock star. Own it. Ice, out. Has anyone seen a 7-Eleven out here? Attention, everyone. Attention. We are looking for a competitor named Harry Ballsonya. Harry Ballsonya? Please report to the control room immediately. I repeat, Harry Ballsonya. This will be the... (ALL GIGGLING) Oh, damn it! Who did this? Making me look like a fucking asshole! (SHUSHING) We really should have brought ice. Dont worry about it. Hey! Is that a cell phone? Maybe we can use it to call the wedding. Stall them or something. Lm on it. Hey! I wouldnt do that. See those lumps of dirt? Dog poops. Landmines. If you guys are gonna get through this, you better watch your step. Check it out. Hey, when you said, you guys,  are you not coming with us? I need to go find Tonto and kill him, but this is for you. Mm-hmm. Yeah, if you... If you just wait, well go with you. We can protect you. (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh, youre serious. Yeah. Look, the only reason I dont want you guys coming with me is because you would completely fuck it up. No offence. Oh. Okay. I really do love you. Frankly, lm surprised youre still alive. Okay, got it. Bye, Ed. Yup, bye, Katnip. Be safe. Yeah. Try not to die. Sorry, buddy. Shell be back. Mm-hmm. Although unless she has a birthday in the next couple of hours, shell still be 17. Yeah, got it. I know were in a futuristic dystopia and everything, but jailbait is jailbait, brother. Yeah, what dating site did you get her from? J-Bait? Get it? Not now, Zach. But good one. Hey! Hey! What the fuck are you doing? What Katnip would do. (EXCLAIMS) Okay, lm good. Oh, shit. God damn it. What? What? Oh. Hi. You mind if I just grab a weapon? (SCREAMS) Lts too bad you couldnt help your friend. A generic straight man. What was his name? Doug. And hes not a straight man. Well, hes probably long dead. And soon, youll be long dead, too. (SCREAMING) This is for threatening my friend! This is for being a bitch to me in the woods! This is for calling my hometown Podunk! This is for not returning my sexts! And this is for ruining the prom! Yeah! Holy fucking shit. You just brutally murdered a young girl. Yeah. And the weird thing is I thought it would take more hits. But I guess you live and learn. Or at least, she doesnt. Am I right? Am I right? Yeah, whatever you say. Of course. All right, look, we can still get out of this thing. We just gotta get this bromance thing back in gear. Oh, be careful! Oh, Jesus. If you were Doug, where would you be? Maybe these guys can help us find him. Hey, little buddies. How are my favourite imitation puppets doing? Oh, fuck! My hammie, again! Kick his ass! Lets fuck him up! Wait, wait! I thought you puppets were the good guys! What the fuck? We used to be. Yeah, but now weve stared death in the face. Weve seen the depths of human suffering. And were already dead inside. Yeah. Thats awful. My God, lm sorry. Come on, you bitch! Yeah, you scared coward! Youre not man enough to fuck with me! You wouldnt last two minutes in my world, you bitch! Is that the Mike Tyson rant? Fuck you. Fuck you, you ho. Lll fuck your ass in front of everybody! Yeah, thats definitely the Tyson. Enough talk! Kill them! (ALL CLAMOURING) (SCREAMING) A mine is a terrible thing to waste. That was actually a pretty good one, Zach. Yeah? Yeah. At least that was just my reader copy. Guys, a little help? You four-eyed fuck. You see this coming? (SCREAMS) Fuck me! Right in the smarts! Thats painful! But also hilarious. (MOANING) Thats my girl! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, youre hurt! You should see the other guy. You killed Tonto? Yeah. Come on, we need to get you in the shade. Can you walk? Lts okay, I got you. I got you, I got you. Move! Move! Lts okay. You all right? Youre gonna be okay. Its okay, I got you. I got you. I got you. There you go. Youre gonna be okay. Its all right, its not that bad. (SHUSHING) Ed, its okay. No, no, no, its not okay! You need help. Ed, one of us had to die. Well, I wish it was me. Me, too. What? Sorry. That slipped out. Sorry. Yeah, that came out real fast. Its okay. Um... Speaking of, since... Since this is it for me, do you want to see them? See what? My boobs, dummy. I... I would. Very much. Okay. I know youve been waiting for this. Pretty nice, huh? Unbelievable. Wow. No tan lines. Unbelievable. But if hed move a little bit, I could see them better. Ed? Yeah, yeah. The light is starting to fade. Will you look deep into my eyes as I fade away? Absolutely, Katnip. Ed, up here. Yeah? Lm sorry. I love them. I mean, I love you. I love all of you. I know. Goodbye. Lll... lll see you soon enough. Okay. Wait, whats that supposed to mean? Katnip? Hey, do you know something I dont? Am I next? (CANNON BLAST) Yeah, shes dead, thatd be weird. Thatd be weird. Lm sorry. I think its time we made the call. (PHONE RINGING) Tracey, its Bradley. MAN: I don't know who you are or what you want. Fuck, I think I dialled the wrong number. What I do have are a particular set ofskills. Lfyou give my daughter back to me now, thatll be the end of it. But ifyou don't... Okay. I will... (ENDS CALL) Crazy. Definitely not Tracey. Let me try again. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Tracey, its Bradley. Hey, man, whats wrong? I dont know. The first girl I ever loved just died. I watched you murder a girl with your bare hands. Were as good as dead. And the worst part is we lost our best friend. Thats whats wrong. I cant help but accept some responsibility for this. Yeah, no, I blame you for the majority of it. Seriously? I mucked up the bachelor party. I got us stuck in some weird alternate universe. This whole thing just went right down the tubes! I didnt even get to be a part of the Human effing Centipede. What did you just say? I dont care how awkward it is, sharing a gastric system is a life experience. I could have scrapbooked about it. No, no, before that. This whole thing went down the tubes. Doug! Are you having a flashback montage? The tubes! I know where Doug is! Bradley! Where are you guys? What's going on? Bradley! Bradley? Bradley? Bradley? Bradley? Hey, Tracey! Lts Ed! Ed! Ed, what in the H-E-double hockey sticks is going on? Were gonna go pick up Doug right now, so don't you worry your pretty little man face about it. Okay, but we gotta go. Well see you real soon, bye! What the fuck, man? I know where Doug is! Come on! Go! Lets go, lets go! Hello? Hello? This is it! Dougs tube never came up! What? Well, if hes not down there, where the hell is he? Okay, lets face it. Dougs not in the tube. There was no sign of him in the arena. He is gone. That is a fact. You fucking idiots! (ALL GROANING) God fucking damn it! Jesus! That bush is angry! Lm not that bush,  you bearded piece of afterbirth! Lts me! Doug! (ALL EXCLAIMING) Shut up! All you guys, just shut the fuck up! You guys forget me all the fucking time! In Vegas! In this fucked-up alternate universe! Yeah. Lm barely in the goddamn movie trailer! Lts true, I dont even think hes on the poster. I never get any punchlines, and you keep leaving me in enclosed fucking places! You think maybe we can talk to you about this at sea level? Not this time. This time, I get the last laugh. Jeez, dude! Wait, wait, wait! Youre right! Youre right! Were sorry. We haven't given you your proper due. You are the perfect blend of handsome and humourless. Without you, there are no jokes. Hell, without you, there is no us. You may be a gay man, but you are the best damn straight man weve ever met. Ah! I could never murder you guys. (ALL SIGH) You! Wait here one second. (ALL GRUNTING) You guys! That worked great! Lm so glad youre alive, man! Bradley, bring it in! You guys, this is just perfect. Nothing could possibly ruin this moment. MAN OVER PA: Hello out there, everybody. Hey, remember that earlier "bromance revision" I was telling you guys about? Well, you can forget about that. Theres only gonna be one winner of the Hungover Games. So if youre a foursome of dudes who recently bro-conciled, you're gonna have to kill each other. You're just gonna have to fight to the death. Lm sorry, I dont make up the rules. Wait, I do. I do make up the rules. Suckers! Well, good luck and may the odds be forever in your blah-blah-blah, et cetera, et cetera. This is gonna be good. Nope. No way. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Wait, why are all these weapons shaped like dicks? All right, listen, guys. Listen up. Lets talk about this. I cant die now. Lm about to get married. I have a wife and kids at home. I just lost Katnip! She was my everything. She was also very much underage. DOUG: Seriously? Ed, buddy, there are laws against that. You cant statutory rape your soulmate. Jeepers creepers! You guys, dont you remember? Were a brotherhood! You heard the announcement. Its every man for himself. No! I have an idea. We all need to eat these. Theyre Midnight Berries. Its the only way to end this. That is what got us into this mess in the first place. Yeah, these berries would kill us. But the Capitol wont even let us swallow them. Theyd rather have four winners than no winner. So before we even get these in our mouths theyll cancel the whole thing. You have to trust me. Absolutely not. Doubt me all you want, but dont doubt my knowledge of young adult fiction. Lm in. What? Me, too. Really? Fine. Me, too. Lm in. But only because I love you guys. Okay. On the count of three. One. Two. Three. What do we do now? Come on! Kinda tasty. (GAGGING) Zach, you dumb motherfucker! What the... Morning. You guys sleep well? Yeah. Pretty well. Anyone have floss? I think lve got Midnight Berry seeds stuck in my teeth. Wait, wait. What time is it? Lts 10:00 a.m. Well never make the wedding. Wanna bet? You guys think you can take me out of the straitjacket now? Guys, I am just so pumped to be a real member of this group. Its so cool youre gonna let me have more lines in the next movie. Thats right, yeah. Totally gonna happen. Yeah, more lines, definitely. (TYRES SCREECH) Come with me if you want to attend a gay wedding. Sorry. Getting here was a real bloodbath. What the fucksticks, you guys? Honey, I am so, so, so sorry. You had better have a good explanation for this. Trace, the last three days were, without a doubt, the most backwards, fucked up, inexplicable experience of my entire life. I saw brutal death. I saw murderous talking puppets. I saw gay Thor. But all I could think about was you. Can you forgive me? Well, boys will be boys. So are we gonna talk about last night? Okay. Whatever the hell we think happened, it obviously didnt really happen. Zach just got in our heads with that dumb book of his, so just forget about it and move on. Lm over it, too. Lm onto Fifty Shades now. This rich guy is erotic. You know what? You guys are wrong. Over the course of one day, I loved, I lost, and I almost died, like, 10 times. You also ate a boatload of shit. Thank you for the reminder. But thankfully, it wasnt real. You gotta let it go, man. You know what? You can believe what you want, but I know my connection with that girl was real. Theres a lot of wiener in this book. But lm not mad about it. This probably would make a really good TV movie. Get Alyssa Milano. Oh. Sorry. So sorry about that. Its been a bit of a... Dont worry about it. Weddings that way. (LAUGHS) Well, it was nice bumping into you. Hey, bud. We gotta go. I know. Do you... What are you stammering about? MAN: We are gathered here today to celebrate the pure and magical love of these two deeply, deeply passionate men. Guys, thats her. I swear to God, shes right there. Stop, man. There is no her. Yeah... Do I need to set you up with a shrink? Lm telling you, shes... Dude. Enough. Fine. Letting it go. Thank you. MAN: Some people say love is nothing but a battlefield. Not me. These days, people dont view marriage as something to enjoy. They view it as something to survive. So Doug, Tracey, with that, I say may the odds be ever in your favour. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) This tree has a vagina. (LAUGHING)
