No, Taiko. No. No, Taiko. No. Please, no. - We had an agreement. - I'm begging, please. Do as your told, or I kill your mother and daughter. Do anything you want to me, but, please, please, just leave them out of this. I don't need your permission to do anything I want with you. I own you. - Yes. Please... - Or did you forget that? - If you ever loved me... - This isn't about love. It's about honor. You were taken to be a whore, just like the others, but when I saw you, I said, "No, she's special. She's mine." But you betrayed me, Everly. You... You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

First you abandon your daughter, and now you put our lives in danger? - MAN: Bitch! - I did not abandon her. You have no clue what happened to me. You need to see me so I can give you enough money for you to disappear tonight. You have to start a new life where no one can find you, or else you're dead, and Maisey's doomed to a life of misery.

You don't have any money or even go out of this apartment. He doesn't give you any money. You think you're better than us? Huh? You're just his fucking slave. - (GUN CLICKING) - Listen to me. I can prove it to you. I have enough money for both of us, okay? Bullshit. He doesn't give you any money, bitch. You don't have... Okay. Shit. - Fuck. - That's what I said. Who the fuck did all this? Did you do all this? Is he paying you for each one? Dena? Everly? You're not dead. Sorry, sweetie, but I need that fucking money. Get the fuck out of here. She's mine. Elyse, you greedy bitch, you have that money. I don't need your fucking help. She doesn't even have a gun. - I got here first! - You fucked up. - Fuck you. Fuck you. - You fucked up.

Just put some pressure on here. I'm scared. I don't want to go to hell. Okay. Anna, you have to kill her. I don't want to die alone. I mean, I already know she's going. You're going to be okay. Shh. - What... - Okay. Shh. - Put some of this on. - Okay. Okay. (LIQUOR POURING) Dena. ANNA: Dena. I'm sorry. I have to do this. If I don't, Taiko's going to kill me. Anna, look around you. - I can kill you, too. - No. We don't have to do this right now. I know I'm going to die tonight, but I have a mother and a five-year-old daughter, and I have to do something to make sure they're going to be okay. Why? - You were a mother once. - Stop. Stop. Don't talk. Please help me save my child. After that, I will come back here, and I promise it'll be you who finishes this off. How do I know you're going to come back? Because as long as I'm alive, he will be obsessed with hunting us. But once I'm gone, he'll forget about them in time, and they will be free. I will make sure I die tonight, but I don't want to give any of them the satisfaction. (GUN THUMPS) I want it to be you. Okay. I'm going to give you two hours, Everly, but don't fuck with me. Because if you can do all of this, then I can do it, too. Good luck. - (DOOR CLOSES) - (SIGHS) (YELLS) That's a lot of dead whores. You don't get to call them that. Get up. Now. Can't. (WINCES) How bad is it? It's pretty bad. It's just a flesh wound. It doesn't look fatal. Can't say the same. At least you don't feel anything. (COUGHS) Can I ask you a favor? Seriously? (CHUCKLES) I'm thirsty. (FOOTSTEPS THUMPING) - You're welcome. - (SLURPING) (WAILS) (GAGPS, YELLS) Are you smiling? Changed my mind. (SWALLOWS) (DOG BARKING) We're too high up. Don't even think about it. Best-case scenario, the fall kills you. Worst case, you break your legs, and the dog eats you alive. Come here, Banzai. - I hate that dog. - (BANZAI BARKING) Me, too. You know guns, and you're not a bad shot, but you're not going to make it. Tell Taiko he can lick my balls. (GUNSHOT) - Told you. - MAN: My turn, bitch! I'm nobody's bitch! (GLASS CRASHES) (GLASS CRASHES) (HIGH-PITCHED WHINE) No, please don't. - Finally. - (WHINE FADES) Ralph. - Sorry, - (GROANS) (CELL PHONE RINGING) - Hello. - EDITH: Everly, where are you? I thought you were leaving 20 minutes ago. I was. Just had to wrap some things up first. Of course. Maisey's cold, and I don't like it up here. I'll call you when I'm on my way. Okay. (POLICE SIRENS BLARING) Oh, shit. (GROANS) Great. - (KNOCK ON DOOR) - MAN: Police, ma'am. Ma'am, the building's not safe. Open up. NEIGHBOR: What's going on out there? I'm all alone, and it's the middle of the night. - Get out of here. - Please open up, ma'am. We're evacuating the building. NEIGHBOR: Why don't you get rid of all those whores around here? It's like in the Bible, you know, Sodom and Gomorrah. You have to evacuate the building, ma'am. This way, please. Follow me. I'm not going anywhere until my daughter gets here. That poor woman. Her daughter's been dead for two years. - Okay... - Good night! MAN: You have a video feed of the building? Fancy. You know how much he likes to watch. I suppose it would be too much to ask you to kill me instead of have to face him. I didn't join in. I could have. Oh, how generous of you. Oh, wait. Should I be offended? I was just following orders. (CHUCKLES) And that absolves you of any responsibility? No, but some of these guys actually enjoy this. The rest of us do it out of fear, because if you don't, Taiko will kill you or worse. Taiko has forced me to do so many things so vile, human trafficking, sex slavery. Gang rape. Talk to God. I'm not interested in your confession. Wait. Don't leave the video for him to see. Don't. Trust me. Destroy it. - (EVERLY YELLING) - (MAN GRUNTING) (RECORDING CONTINUES) (MEN LAUGH) (YELLING, GRUNTING CONTINUE) (MAN SPEAKING JAPANESE) - (SPEAKING JAPANESE) - No!

There's no point in squeezing your ass after passing wind. Callate, pendejo. (COUGHS) I told you. There's no way out. What are you going to do? Either you can help me or shut the fuck up. - May I suggest an idea? - No. Something my grandfather would say. I think I had my fill of Buddhist proverbs for the day, Dead Man. A sanctuary sometimes resides in the eye of the storm. (FOOTSTEPS THUMPING OVERHEAD) (SPEED-DIALS) Mom. I'm sorry. I cannot get out of here, so you're going to have to come to me. You need to get rid of your car. It's probably being tracked. EDITH: What? No, no, no, no. I am not giving up the car. Forget about your car. Forget about your house. You must come get the money and vanish. - Isn't that dangerous? - Well, of course it's dangerous here, but it's dangerous everywhere. - I don't know. - Listen. Listen. I have a plan. Come over here. When you're getting closer, call me, and then I'll explain to you exactly what to do. - Where are you? - 157 Hopper Avenue. I am afraid. I'm scared, too. I'll call you when I'm there. So... we are having company. You may want to clean up. Shit.

(GRUNTS) What? I think maybe you should wear something a bit more practical, just in case. (SIGHS) Yeah. Better? Yes. Much better. (COUGHS) Now, what am I going to do with you? Could I ask you for a last favor? Why not? Can you light me a cigarette? You know, smoking will kill you. Arigato. One thing I don't understand, how were you able to get to the police? They got to me. One day, my toilet broke, and a plumber showed up that was not really a plumber. He promised to get me out of here and into the Witness Protection Program if I helped him. Weren't you afraid that he would find out? Every minute of it, but I kept thinking, if they get the motherfucker, I can go back to my family. (CELL PHONE RINGING, BUZZING) Are you guys here? EDITH: We are walking into the lobby now. Tell them that you're coming to see your mother, - Mrs. Haberdash... - Haberdash? That she's been complaining about somebody trying to get her out of her apartment, 7E. Get off on the seventh. Take the stairs to the sixth. I'm at the end of the hall. I'll be waiting for you. Seventh floor. Okay. (SIGHS) Are you ready to meet the family? - Are You? - (SIGHS) This way, Maisey. Stay with me. Mom, say something. - DOORMAN: Can I help you, ma'am? - Say something. Yes, we are coming to visit my mother. Sorry, ma'am. We had an incident earlier. Who exactly are you going to see? Um, Mrs., um... Haberdash. Haberdash. - Haberdash. 7E. - Yes. She's just calling me about these strange people trying to kick her out of her apartment. This used to be a very nice neighborhood. Right, Mrs. Haberdash. Lovely lady. Tell her sorry for the noise. Like I said, we had an incident. It should all be over soon. Thank you. Come, Maisey. Mmm-hmm. Come, come, come. We are in the elevator. Be right up. - Six. - Seventh! - What, Mom? - Siete. Oh, no, seven. My mistake. (LAUGHS) MAN: Seven. You're doing good, Mom. Thank you.

Can we continue this inside, please? No, Mom. There is no time. You have to take the money and go. I'm sorry. Seriously, you have to go. - Cartoons. - Hush. Not right now. Aw, but, Grandma... - Hello. - Hajimemashite. - Who is this? - This is... a long story. (WHEEZING CHUCKLE) Maisey. You don't need to be afraid of me. You know what? I think I have something you might like. It's a Christmas gift. It's for a very special little girl. Would you like to see it? I'm sorry. I didn't have time to wrap it. She's been waiting for you for a very long time. Would you like to hold her? - (BEAR GIGGLING) - You like Pinky Bear, right? - Yeah. - What do you say? Thank you. You're welcome. - (BEAR GIGGLING) - She is very pretty, like you. Well, I would love for both of you to stay, but I understand you need to go. If they ask you about Mrs. Haberdash, just tell them that you need to put this in the car and that you're coming back to get her. Maisey, I need to speak with Everly in private. Stay put right here. Don't move. Don't touch anything or anybody, okay? Mom, we really cannot do this now. I am not going to ask you twice. Where is the bathroom, please? What? Keep an eye on her. OK. Hi. Hi. (COUGHS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Sit down. And now you're going to listen to me. Look at me! Do you have any idea what you've made me go through? Do you have any idea of the nights I've spent, tortured by thoughts that you became a street junkie? Or that you were dead somewhere and I was powerless to help you? Then out of the blue, her highness calls me in the middle of the night... and tells me to come to this royal apartment! Was I such a bad mother? No, Mam. Let's not talk about me, forget about me... But Maisey?! She needs you. What type of mother are you? You never sent her a single birthday card, or a Christmas card... Not even a phone call! Are you listening to me? (SOBS) But... I'm just so happy that you're alive. Honey, I've missed you so much. But now... You need to help me understand what happened. Please. Tell me. I don't know where to begin, Mama. There's so many things I'd like to say to you. But I can't. There's just no time. I can tell you this. I was taken against my will to be someone's slave. I've been locked up in this apartment for four years. I... I don't know if you understand that. I'm so sorry. What are you doing here? Just visiting. (GASPS) What's that? (GASPS) Don't go over there. Why not? Because I need your help with something. What? I wanted to sing a song for you, but I forgot the words. What song? "Itsy Bitsy Spider." I know it. I know it. (COUGHING) Are you sick? I am, but singing always makes me feel better. Itsy bitsy spider Crawled up the waterspout Down came the rain And Flushed the spider out? You're funny. (CHUCKLES) Thank you. I did not want you to get involved in this. I did everything I could to protect you. Who is this man? He's the Devil. What did he do to you? Did he torture you? No. I am luckier than most girls that get sent overseas or stuck in a dungeon where they are raped constantly. They don't even last that long. For me, my worst torture was losing my child. That's it. It's over. I am here, and we are leaving together right now. Let's go. Mama, this is not a telenovela. Who do you think you are? Forget about me. I don't want you to be a part of this world. - (RINGTONE CHIMING) - What's that now? - (MUFFLED YELP) - (CHIMING CONTINUES) EVERLY: That's who he is. That's what he brings, mierda, muerte. You must leave without me so you can protect Maisey. Do you understand now? Hey. Where did you go? (FOOTSTEPS) Is this a Christmas present? Not exactly. (WEAKLY) Everly. - It's wet. - Everly. Can I open it? I don't think that's a good idea. - Everly. - What do you think it is? I couldn't even imagine. Come on. You are not leaving here alive, are you? Sorry, Mommy. MAN: Everly. No! No! Stop. Stop. Don't touch that. Don't touch that. I'm sorry, honey. No. My sweet little... Are you hurt? - Oh, my. - I'm sorry.

(GASPS) And so it ends, not with a bang, but a whimper. You are nothing. You don't exist. This is all a nightmare. If I die, it'll be like waking up. And if I don't... it'll be your nightmare, motherfucker. (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHS) You have been a revelation. But don't kid yourself. You have only gotten so far because I allowed you to. If you're going to do it, just do it, and shut up. After all you've been through tonight, did you really think I would make it that easy? Yeah. Why haven't you killed me? Maybe you can't bear the thought of living without me. Maybe no matter what I do... you just don't want me gone. Hmm? Maybe I go across the hall and get your daughter, make her watch the rest of this. Does little Maisey know that her mother is nothing but a used, discarded whore? Keep my daughter's name out of your mouth! (KICK MISSES) (CHUCKLES) Your bastard child should be honored that I even know its name, that I let it live, in spite of its traitorous mother! (GASPING) (SCREAMING) No! (GASPS) (GASPS) Frankly, death by my sword is an honor you don't deserve. (GASPING) I would take your heart, but your betrayal has shown me that you don't have one. You stole my life. I owe you no loyalty. I fucking hate you! (GASPING) I loved you. Tough shit. It's infinitely more painful to remove a tattoo than it is to receive one. And the same is true for love. (GAGS) You don't have to go through the pain of removing your love for me... so I will take back my tattoo as a souvenir. (CHUCKLES) You branded me like a cow. Take it. - (GASPS) - (YELLS) Turn over. I want to look at your eyes when I kill you. (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (GASPS) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (CRACKLING STOPS) (GROANS) (SPITS) If I die by your hand, you and Maisey will never be safe. (GROANS) Then die with honor. Do it yourself. What happened to honor in love? (SIGHS) You'll never know love like I do. (GRUNTS) (GROANING) (LAUGHS) (YELLS) (GROANS) (GASPS) (SIGHS) (BODY THUMPS) (TAPE RIPS) (ZIPPER ZIPS) MAISEY: What are you doing with Pinky Bear? (BREATHING HEAVILY) Take Pinky Bear. Take Pinky Bear, and she'll protect you. Okay? Yeah? And promise she's going to stay with you and you won't lose her? Promise me. Okay. Now, I'm going to be right back. Don't move.

It's over. I know who you are. You do? You're my mommy. I have your picture in my room. That makes me very happy. You know what? I've always had your picture with me, too. And now I want you to have it, okay? I want you to keep it and think about me, my little girl. Why were you gone so long, Mommy? I miss you. I miss you so, so much too. And... not one minute went by where I didn't think about you. (SNIFFLES) I had a hole in my heart right here every second we were apart.
