There's no hope for me. I'll go out anyway. It works this way because you decided it. You're good. You've done well. The people don't know. They're deceiving themselves. If one's not part of the circle, what does he have to do? Die?! Does he have to give up? He can't do a thing. There's no space. You left everything in the hands of these whores! They do whatever the fuck they want to! You made everybody die, and you don't give a damn! You're doing it on purpose. You studied this thing well. People will go crazy, make mistakes... Mistakes! They're making mistakes, so you're in the right. You can say it: "You see, you made a mistake?" It's easy that way! You're giving an illusion so you can cover your asses! The people don't know. They all believe... ...things. If you get angry, it's your fault. You must be quiet, subdued! You must suffer hoping, waiting. You see them passing by in front of you, arrogantly. They think they're something they're not. They don't have the humility to understand... ...that they're worth nothing. Nothing! They think they're indispensable, doing their important things. They were only lucky enough to be born without a dick! You don't give a damn. You live off of people's ignorance. You know that nothing can be done about it. You create smoke, so people won't know what's right and what's wrong. And you can do whatever the fuck you want! But I'm not afraid of you! I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! You're already studying. - Hi. - Hi, good morning. Is Lisa still sleeping No, she's awake. - The door is shut. - It's because of the light. She keeps it shut because light penetrates inside when it's open. - It's for the photos... - Again? Enough with the photos, ok? I'm going to pick up Queequeg. - Really? - Tell her. Do you have to go out? I took the keys. Not me. - We should pay Amalia... - Shitalia is here?! She'll hear you. She's right underneath. So what, it's affectionate... It's not that... I'll leave the money on the nightstand. Study well. He really had no reason to, on the contrary. Oh, come on... Yes, yes... He went with a little girl! PENAL CODE I had to what?! Look, I don't want to discuss it. The day hasn't even started yet, so... Ok, give me the number. Yes... Yes, yes... Yes, bye. Poor idiot... - Did uoy kool edistuo? - No. Look out the window. Mum went to pick up Queequeg. - Yes. I saw that she... - The brace? You got rid of it? Yes, I can't wear it anymore. - Damn it's cold! - Close it. Cool! We weren't on these terms... So... If he finds a lawyer that can promise him... It means that they're proposing something stupid, because there's... I'm not at all convinced... I'm... Hallo? Hallo? Hallo? What is it? It's the servant... Lisa! What's going on? Mum... I'll go look for mum. Stay calm... Calm. Dad, don't go out. Don't go! Try the cellphone. Shouldn't we pick up... the thing... ...below? No signal... No signal. The radio... Dad... Dad, I'm afraid. What was it? - Nothing, it was... Nothing, she's just afraid. A nightmare? No, she wasn't even sleeping. - What should we do? - I don't know, Tommaso. - We can't stay here. - And where should we go? How can we get out? Haven't you seen the Padovano's? If we get inside the car? We could go to our grandparents. As soon as this... I'm cold. Take a blanket. Give her a blanket. - Go and take... - I'm cold too. Take a sweater. Bring one for me too. It's cold. It's colder. There's no power. There's... In my study... Can you get there? There's an emergency lamp. I turned it off to save power. - Dad, what should we do? - I don't know, Tommaso. - Don't worry. - Lisa is not speaking... She doesn't say a thing. She looked at me and screamed. Tommaso... Don't leave me. Dad! No, no, we're here. We're here. What is this? - I hear a... - Me too. It's the bells. - Do you hear? It's the bells. - Yes, it's those... - The church. - Yes. Saint Patrizio... There's somebody in the church. Of course! It must be the priest. The big guy... What was his name? You know, the one... The one people say is a drunk! Couldn't it be that it's just the wind swinging them? - No. - No... They're too heavy, it's impossible... ...I think. If not... - You think? Elisabetta, I'm not the bell maker... ...or the priest. But there's no wind. If there was it would clear... Why is he ringing? To let people know someone's there? To draw attention... Yes. It's like... ...with the whistle, like shipwreck surivors, to draw... Yes, right. They're calling for someone to pick them up. They must've heard that they organized... They don't see us because of the... Help! Maybe it was just to give a bit of hope to the people. Settled. Now we won't see... And... the servant... - Did you hear a... - No. You? No, everything's the same. Nothing can be heard. And with this noise... Earlier, I thought I heard, from there... like voices. Why doesn't it raise away? What is it? I don't see anything. And if she's still alive? I don't hear anything. There were noises before. I heard the dog again. From the living room? - Yes. - I heard that too. The owners must be... But there are... dogs, birds... cats. It doesn't affect him. I read on the internet that they were trying out a chemical that doesn't dissolve after it makes contact with the air. That it takes a lot of time for it to dissolve. - Where did you read it? - On the internet. I can't remember, it was a military thing. They had to try it out here of all the places. With all the remote villages that there are. Listen, I have to... use the bucket? Yes. Maybe you'll have to... Who used it last? I didn't empty it the last time. - Wait, I'II... - I'll do it. I'll do it. The next time... Remember that the next time... We'll take turns. Have you noticed the insects near the trash bin? Is Queequeg's net preventing them from coming up? Yes, don't worry. This is good! We should remember the brand for... - Finished? - Yes. Samantha! Samantha! There's a dog. That's good for you. Go, because today... What's going on? Who are you? Are you alone? Are there others? No, just us three. Do it... Eat. Aren't you hungry? Are you the rescue team? The rescue team? - Who are you? - How did you manage to get here? - There's no... - The fog? It's always there. It's been a couple of days that it doesn't raise away. How did you manage to get here with the fog? We are immune. - How... - What do you mean? We are immune to fog. It does nothing to us. It's like the fog... like when there's fog. The same effect. That's why we call it that way. Did you find a solution? What does one do? No... sit down. There are girls like me, like her, that have... I was outside when it first came down. - Me too. - She too. I saw people burning. You must've seen them too. If you haven't you don't stay inside the house. - Would... How does it go? - Wouldn't. You saw, didn't you? - Yes. - Outside there's... - Who was it. - The housemaid. - The girl that came... - That's... That's what this fog does to people. Everyone, except us. - We are a group. - About ten of us. Yes, and we are organizing ourselves. How many adults are there among these ten? - No, you don't understand. - There are no adults. The two oldest girls are 19. - Yes. We go from 15... - 13. - Lauretta has 13. - Yes, 13. From 13 to 19. You're all girls? Yes, I said that. Didn't you hear me? - No, I haven't... - Are you the only ones not affected? - The 10 of you? - I don't know that. I didn't even find the others at first. I was alone for several hours before I met... Sara. We meet someone every day. But it has been a while since we last met somebody. But we stayed in the quarter. Yes, we look... We control how people are doing. If there's anybody in need. They're all closed inside, like you. We do it because of this noise. It grows when... Why do you have guns? We had some bad experiences. How did you enter? - We heard... - Yes, it was the kitchen door. Does it go through... from there? No, it's ok if you shut it. A piece of cardboard is enough. You put it... But... your families? - Mum... - Have you seen... we... My wife went out when the fog came down... ...earlier. She's a tall woman, red haired, thin. - Her name is Gloria. - Yes, Gloria Cruciani. Her maiden name on her ID card. I didn't see her. I'm lawyer Cruciani... Attilio. - They... - Tommaso. - Elisabetta. - They are our children. I'm Emma. She's Samantha. Did you... Yes, it will take a while to burn everything. Lisa? I brought you the bug spray. - Thanks. - You can do without the net, if... No, it's best if we leave it there. Listen, I wanted to ask you... Is there... ...where you're staying, is there... ...a power supply, something to recharge the batteries? No. What is it that you wanted to recharge? My digital camera. The... - You make photos? - Yes, but... ...it's completely discharged. I like it very much and... ...I was practising with this. You see, now it's closed, but, when the window is open, the light comes in from behind and hits it. You can also do image composition. You know, for practice purposes. I miss it a lot. It could seem... With all the other things that are missing. Everything I see is confused. When did you start? Recently. It was a passion of mine. It's a positive consequence from the crash. I like to think that... That's the negative one. You didn't have it on when we came in. - I don't remember. - No, I tried... ...to get rid of it, but I still can't... What happened? A terrible crash. Thre were no serious consequences, but I completely destroyed the car. Both me and my dog, Queequeg, got hurt. Our dog. I got away with less injuries because I had my seatbelt on. Incredible, it really works! I never would've thought so! When someone tells you you say: "Alright!". - But no, it's... - And the dog? What's his name? Queequeg. It's a character from a novel. My grandmother chose it. - Is he... - No, no. He's at my grandmother's, in the country. - Is it still... - No, it's... I don't smell it anymore. It was really terrible. Almost worse than having her... I never smelt anything like that in my entire life. Yes, the flesh doesn't burn like... How can you manage? How could you take it outside? I'm used to it. Have you burned many? Were there dog bites, as you were saying? - Yes. - Oh, I see. So... How come? The hunger... They can't find... Put it inside your mouth. It will go away instantly... They take away the smell. - Ah, it's like... - They burn! Yes, that too, but... They work. They work. - You don't... - No, I... I prefer a bit of orange juice. I'll get you a glass. Here. How are things outside? What's the news? There's concern, but less than when it all started. - They're all... We have... - Ah! We wanted to ask you... - The bells... - Ah, yes. We heard... There were the bells that... ...that rang from the church of S. Patrizio. We thought that someone was trying to draw attention... - What was it? - I don't know. I don't even know where this church is. It's down the alley. Have you seen the crossroads? Have you been there yet? I haven't. Surely there's somebody there, because the bells... - Someone must've... - Maybe the others went there. - You see, maybe there are... - Yes. There are 34 houses in these 5 streets. This one and the others. Small ones. There aren't hundreds of us. But you said that the major part is empty... ...the houses. - Yes, but empty doesn't really mean empty. What do you mean? It means that there's nobody alive inside. There was no need, I would've brought it. I'm just... Sorry for the mess. Here. - What does your mother do? - Nothing. That is... ...housekeeping. She was working for my father, but when we were born she quit. And what was her job at your father's? - Assistant. She was... - Assistant? A sort of secretary. No, no. She wasn't a secretary. She... They worked together. She assisted him with things. You must prepare a lot of things when you're a lawyer. It's not just going to the court. This bed is nice. It's soft. Yes, it's... Should we go back down? Yes. Where's Emma? What do you mean "girls that try"? To exit. Those that try to go outside! What do you mean try? You don't know? She told me that she told you and you said no. - That you're not up for it. - Up for what? - You didn't talk about it? - No. We're too few, and we talked about this thing. We're not related. We didn't even know each other before. - I mean the girls. - Yes. We tried to find analogies. Why is it that the fog has no effect on us The only thing that binds us is that we are all females. And the age. We're all between 13 and 19. We have nothing else in common. So if a girl has these two features, she should also be immune. But she might not know it because she wasn't outside when the fog came down... What we're trying to do... ...is go to the girls of that age and talk to them. We split our tasks. You... She should've told you. So, it's not true that you're afraid. Look, we can try it out. You and me, with an open window. We'll do it together. You needn't fear, because in case... ...I will close it straightaway. - No, no. Wait, I'm telling you... Don't worry. They surely had some sort of a setback. They have a lot of things to do. Now they know we're here. They know how much we can last with what they brought us. They know they must come back. There are no motives for not... They won't leave us... They won't leave us. It works this way because you decided it! You left everything in the hands of these whores! They do whatever the fuck they want to! They don't have the humility to understand that they're worth nothing! But I'm not afraid of you! I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! Open the door! Hi... Finally! - What happened? - Nothing. We had to cut down on our visits. We're searching for others that are immune. We're always outside searching. We can only do one thing at a time. I told you that we're too few. We can't... As soon as we make one tour... ...it's already time to do another one. We're doing the deliveries all by ourselves. We must find others that are immune. That way we can be more... How are you doing? - We didn't eat for two days... - Now you'll have food for a while. Is that all? There's nothing else? We're sharing it out. - We're trying to... - How much stuff is left... ...at the supermarket? Enough. Ok. You're already leaving? Yes, we have a lot to do. Are there any problems? Is there something wrong? We saw... mister Fabbri. The one that lives opposite... That lived... I saw him too. He was in front of his house. - Yes, he came out screaming... - It happens. Not everyone can withstand. Now you're the last house of the tour. You're lucky. At least you have company. Yes, I'm always telling them that... And there's this new friend of ours... No? You'll be back soon, won't you? We'll be waiting for you! Let's eat! No. ? deneppah tahW Make it last. Ah, Tommaso! What are you doing? Are you going out? It's late, isn't it? Maybe it would be better for you if you stayed here tonight. It's too late to go back to the supermarket. It's dark. It's dangerous. Era ouy gniraew emufrep? I know that you're an excellent driver now. Perfume? But, you know, when you have many responsibilities, you musn't only worry about yourself, but others too. If something happens to the van, how would you distribute the food? It's a problem. Not only for you. You have to be in perfect shape, perfectly healthy. It's getting colder. You also have to worry about others that are depending on you. They are becoming many and you must be careful. You shouldn't take risks. At this time... Tomorrow morning, with the light... We have a guest room and nobody's using it. And we would be glad if we had some company for the night. We would do something different. It's decided, you're staying. Tommaso will show you the way. Tommaso, show Samantha the way. Let her see where she can settle. What are you doing? Go to sleep! Come. Do you want to sleep here? I'll go over there. Dad, didn't you hear me? Aren't you going to stop them? Ah, you're saying that... Tommaso and... Your brother! He took it all after me. It's a matter of character. He knew it. You two arranged it. - He didn't tell me anything. - I told him not to... I know that you say everything to each other. But it's not a serious thing. He's a boy. It's different because... He's also having a good time by now, and we're talking about it in here. You'll see that things will be better from now on. She'll grow fond of him, and she'll come more often. We'll have more food. What was I supposed to do? What else could I do? I considered everything, even going out. But how could I? There can be no consequences. It's harmless, right? Do you know what was the alternative? You were supposed to try going out. You have the same age as these girls. You're exactly like them. There's not a single reason for you not to try, also because they're looking for more... I'm sorry, I didn't want to say this. I'm tired. I can't think. Don't cry. We'll solve everything, you'll see. Don't worry. Where are the keys? Why do you move them if only I can use them? I'm the only one... Here. - Are you leaving? - No, I'm just going out to take something. - At the supermarket? - Yes. Say hi to Emma. Tell her that I would be glad that she's visiting me. You're not glad for me? Yes, of course! What does that have to do with it? You still didn't get it that she's a piece of shit. She spends all her time with those two idiots. She thinks that they're doing things, making contacts. She convinced herself that she could make a crystal set. Do you know what a crystal set is? - No. - You see, nobody knows. She thought, because she knew things, at least that's what she thinks... ...she only needed to read the books. Conceited piece of shit. Be prepared for a surprise. Ah, here she is! What have you brought us? Useful things - Meat! - You have meat? Magnificent! It's... - What is it? - It's a dog! I wish it was! It's only a paw. You don't know what I had to go through to bring it! Hidden, to avoid being seen. If not, who knows! I catch them all, so... They're stupid. They approach by themselves. You don't even have to chase them. They just stand there, motionless, even when you point your rifle at them. Nobody feeds them anymore, so they think... They eat us and we eat them. This is the difficult part. This is the real challenge. - What's wrong? - It's a dog! We can't eat it! We are hungry, but... Are you kidding? Do you know what I had to go through to bring it here? - If they find out, they'll kill me. - But I'm thankful... You're making a scene about the dog... and what about these? We haven't eaten for days. We'll skin them. They're tasty even raw. At the end of the day, after I go through all the trouble for people like you, I'll eat anything. - Listen, maybe it's better... - No. You still don't get it. If I forget to bring you food, you'll end up like the guy outside. Do you know how many there are asking for help when I'm passing by. Come here. See? It's not difficult. Now we'll sit down and eat this one first, and then those. That way we'll see... You? Princess, while your nausea goes away, could you also empty the bucket. I'll need to use it after eating the meat. No, no. Please don't. Ah, you see? Your father will do it. Sit down. Here. Cut his hair. Come on! - I'm not good at it. - Me neither. They're too long. It's not manly. Men wear short hair. I'm doing it for you. Ok! It's just hair. It'll grow back. Should we cut them like mine? - Short. - No, wait. What do you use for shaving? You're useless! What are you doing? What are you doing? You must put on some clothes. It's too cold. - Why did you open the curtains? - I'm just testing. I know how it works. The fog sees me. No, it doesn't see me. It feels me. How can I put it... It feels that I'm a male. It must be the testosterone, because before the... It was weaker. I thought I could make it this way... Here is... I generate testosterone. If I cut it off, there shouldn't be... What are you saying? No, it's not a... It's not madness! I could make a clean cut. If I go out and get to the hospital, they can sew it back on. There must be somebody at the hospital. It's just a matter of time. Making it in time. Make a good calculation. It's a good idea. It's the only thing stopping me from going out. I have the right age. Like you. You're a girl. You're a girl. - Yaw siht eb t'nod. - No! You can help me avoid all this. You! Why don't you do something? Go away! Go away! Go away! Here. A glass of water and some round biscuits, with chocolate. I'll take this to Tommaso. Tell him that, from tomorrow, if he wants to eat, he'll come down and sit with us. We're not here for... If it does us any good... Is something wrong? Yes, a lot of things. For example, I need a man, not a boy. A true, skilled man, not like your son. He's just good looking. He had... Why am I even saying this to you? - You know, the responsabilities... - Yeah, yeah. You already told me that. The thing that doesn't get to your heads... the people, You just don't get it! There are important things that I must do. Why are you nodding? I'm following... I understand you, because I'm also... ...in my own small way, with them... They grew attached... When the fog came down, I didn't know what to say, what to do to reassure them. Then, slowly together... Because together we can still try to... Even a little bit, you know... It's important. PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC LAW So? Are you ready? Grandma said that... What is it? What happened? I had a very bad dream. It was horrible! A nightmare. We... Mum! Mum! Mum! Dogs... You see... How little it takes. It only stays inside people's heads. It's true, really true. Have you seen that the fog raised away? No, you haven't. You never look outside, never. You don't know what it was. It was a good idea, there were too many shitheads. For cleaning purposes. But they overdid it. You mustn't always keep it on, because people won't come out. They stay inside. Instead, they should raise it, and when everybody's reassured, come down again. That way you catch a lot of them. Not just one here, one there! They made a mistake. They only took girls... ...young ones, because they needed them. But they took some... Are you menstruating? The period, do you still have it? I do. It never went away. It was the thing I wanted most... You thought that I was a whore. Going to bed with your brother, your father, those outside. There were many of them, all useless. The last couple of weeks they were only surviving on medication. They weren't any good, that's the truth. Because a true man gets you pregnant straightaway. You don't need to sleep with him ten times. It was a good idea. Create an immune male. Restart from there. But nothing happened. I can do this later. Have you ever been to the library near the S. Patrizio church? The church? No! REACTION TIME Written, produced and directed by Antonio Micciulli Based on a short story "The king of immunes" by Alessandro Fabbri
