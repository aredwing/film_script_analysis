You know too much maybe... - Miss Four Eyes. - Oh! I can't see! Then keep headlights off me or I put them out for good. Nyet. Nyet. Take that to the Emir. Oh. What the hell is going on? I can't find my glasses. Lowlife imps. Panderers. Persons entering a no-go zone are reminded that there are insufficient law enforcement personnel to maintain public safety. You are entering a no-go zone and do so at your own risk. My name is Sawa. My father was a cop who fought the flesh-cartels, but the Emir killed him, him and my mother. So one by one I kill them back until they lead me to the Emir. That's all I remember. - It's mine! Mine! - It's mine! - No, stop it! - Mine! Numbers! And I want to tell you something else. My son has got an idea to get a suit. Contaminating my crime scene, Prinsloo? Oh, jeez. You're always on my back, Aker. Looks like somebody used a land mine to clear their sinuses. Mikhail Kratsov. Third trafficker put out of work this week. Who's the coffin-dodger? Blind as a mole. She says Kratsov abducted a Pretty Face and they went at it. No Pretty Face did that. So, what you hiding in your hand there, Prinsloo? Exploding nine millimeter shell. Outlawed tactical weapon issued only to security forces. Well, maybe, Lieutenant, someone in law enforcement is getting tired of these flesh merchants buying out the cops and the courts. Like you, Prinsloo? That's called "extrajudicial assassination." Still against the law, last I heard. Now it's all yours... just the way you like it. The Emir... my parents... The Emir... - Got to find him. I have to find him. I can't remember... I need amp. Sawa, honey. Don't forget. What took you? Ever tweezered brains out of ceiling tile? Where's my amp? I need my head cleared. I'm flashing. Your amp. That's all you could find? Two's already too many, you ask me. Look at you, shaking from withdrawal. Listen to me... before this shit kicks in and you forget everything again. It's a nice Bolognese you made of Kratsov. Congratulations. But you left a witness. He was hurting her. Well, now they know it's a girl... with access to police weapons. If the cops know it, sooner or later some rat in that corrupt department they call a security force sells it to the cartels. Kratsov made a call to his partner. There's a meeting in the safe zone with the Thornhills. I wrote it down. He's trolleying for the Thornhills. They're here to buy girls put on a shipment set up by the Emir. This is the Emir, Karl. It's what we've waited for. Look, Sawa, I want to get these deviants as badly as you do, but I'm looking out for you like your father would've wanted. I owe him that. I get to the Thornhills, I get inside the shipment with the other girls, I get the Emir. So, can we do this? It's an addiction, you know. No kidding. Not the amp. The lust for revenge. A Pretty Face is asking for ya. Is she now? Help you, love? You're Vic Thornhill? I don't believe we've had the pleasure. Be a good girl and remind me, who extended this invitation? Kratsov. He said there was work. You could get me transit out of here? Today? Well, isn't that a peculiar anomaly? Last I heard, Kratsov had shuffled off the ol' mortal coil. You all right, Jeppie? Looking fairly pensive, mate. Tell me, this young lady says she was sent here for gainful employment. I'm wondering if perhaps you've made her acquaintance. I've never seen her before. Well, that's moderately perplexing, isn't it? 'Cause she says she knows your partner. You Kratsov's partner? Well, allow me to rephrase that, because unless you're in business with a bloody great pile of meat, former partner would be the proper mot juste in this case, wouldn't it? Kratsov meets lots of girls. He's a trolley. I can't vouch for her. You can't vouch for much, can you? We... we foray here with a great expenditure of time and money, of which the latter you've gladly partaken. And then you tell me someone's cocked Kratsov and you've got no talent to sell, and then this girl shows up bandying my name about. You're useless as a codless wank, aren't you, Jeppie? Well, go on. Search her. Give me her purse. Oh. I like that. Naughty, naughty. Oh, right. You come well equipped, don't you? I'm inclined to say we let this young lady do her dog and pony for me old man. And if he gives her the thumbs up, then we book her. We'll at least have one girl, then, won't we, Jeppie? I mean, one is better than none. I've just come from your competitor. Staggie. Staggie. And that rubbish he's peddling, nothing but Numbers gang skanks straight off the street. So I will expect quality merchandise or a full refund on the advance, Jeppie. I told you, Kratsov trollies the girls. He handles the money. You find our cash or I'll shove this pen up your bloody nasal passage into your frontal lobe. Are you gonna get me on the shipment or not? Oh, don't worry, pet. You'll love me old man, Clive. Much nuts, he is. Right, off to see Staggie. You all right in there, boss? Dead keen. Ooh, I'll do what you want me to You can turn me inside out You make me feel so tied up Oh, like an animal In a cage Like an animal In a cage Like an animal... Like an animal In a cage Like an animal In a cage Like an animal... Clive told me to bring my toys. The shipment for the Emir. When's it go out? Who the hell are you? Where? When? Six-six. Jeppie. Staggie. Cops, stay down. Sawa, I'm not here to fight. Who are you? You know me. Oburi. I don't remember. Amp'll do that to you. Yeah? What would you know about it? Amp? It's used by security forces for PTSD. Erases emotional trauma, makes you feel invincible. No, what would you know about me being on it, is what I'm asking. It's a tad obvious, isn't it? Sawa, it's also a memory cleanser. - It erases your past. - Sounds great. Look, I get wanting to get rid of the bad stuff. What about the good stuff? Remind me what that would be. You even remember your parents' faces? I remember my parents. I remember that the Emir killed them and that's why I'm on the amp... to make sure he never forgets it. Sawa, if you can't remember what your parents looked like, then you've lost them a second time. Killing the Emir's not gonna bring them back. I knew your parents. How? Get off the amp? Come find me at the old cinema. But the old cinema's Numbers territory. I get off the amp and you sell me to the Numbers, is that it? A police action is now underway. All persons within... It erases your past. It's also a memory cleanser. You've lost them a second time. He killed them. Their faces. Don't forget, don't forget, don't forget, don't forget, don't forget. Well, I guess Clive Thornhill won't be shipping any girls out through the Emir. Not with that jack-o'-lantern tracheotomy you cut into his neck. Remember why you went there? To get inside the transport, to get to the Emir. I can't keep my head clear. You are going to get us both killed. I found something. A council parking ticket. That's where Kratsov's partner came from. Jeppie? He saw you, too? I'm going there, Karl. Before Jeppie disappears. He could still lead us to the Emir. I risked everything for you, Sawa. But now things are getting sloppy. Now you've got Vic Thornhill and Jeppie as witnesses. You keep pushing this too far, they're gonna trace you to me. I got into this because your father was my partner. I know. I know. That's why we're doing this. It's for him. For both of them. Jeppie. Before Jeppie disappears. - Visit Jeppie. - Jeppie. Yes? No, wait. Wrong address. Pretty Face get us in here. Thank you, Pretty Face. He say you go easy or he be poking the eyeball out. Layla? Run! Numbers! Mommy, you're hurt! If they find you, then you'll wish they killed you, understand? Understand? - What's your name? - Naima. You have to go. Money girl. We take money girl. Money girl belong to us. We make deal. Picture of the Pillays' daughter. The stun grenade we found on the ground level. - Prinsloo. - Captain. Policeman's Family Day photo. I've got one at home, but the wife and kids in mine did a runner. Well, Missing Persons is not my beat. Yeah, I heard the lieutenant was a cheeky chappie. Always fun to meet a cheeky chappie. Reynhook. Captain Reynhook. Intel. He was my guy, Henrick Pillay. Well, your guy was dirty, going by the name of Jeppie, working for a trolley named Kratsov. My guy was undercover, leading Kratsov around by the custard chucker. The money the Thornhills were wiring for girls? Used it to fund our operation. Well, I guess now you get to keep all the cash. Right, Reynhook? Old model police issue stun grenade. Rare, wouldn't you say? Your report cited a rare police weapon at Kratsov's, too. Correct, sir. And the witness, the old lady stated there was a girl present. Right. A girl who's vanished. Look, I don't know where you're going with that, but this is obviously a Numbers killing. What would you say if I told you that Pillay was undercover at the Thornhill crime scene? And the assailant was a girl? I'd say that would give us, oh, about a thousand girls with motive to kill a slimeball like Thornhill. Your partner was killed by traffickers, too, Aker, so you know how it is. Pillay witnesses the Thornhill hit, now he's dead. I wanna know who's behind it. Find the girl. It's okay. It's my place. There was a kid. Her parents... Numbers screwed everything. That was brief. Little interlude of concern you showed for the girl. What do you want from me? You forgot I told you. I knew your parents. What's wrong with you? I get it. It's too long without the amp, right? Is that it? Need to clear your head? Every time it starts to wear off, you get the flashes, go right back for another dose. So you won't even remember who you are. That'll be a day to look forward to. You make friends fast, Aker. They're easier to make than get rid of. Now, what's with this bullshit about Pillay being dirty? Even I know Intel had a guy on the inside using the name Jeppie. It's good to know you read those Intel memos, Prinsloo. The Emir, he killed them. My parents. ...going to get us both killed. - I need amp. - Your amp. Listen, if you want to help her, I know where to find the girl. Look, I don't need you to do anything, okay? All right. You know, it's ironic, isn't it? You doing what you're doing 'cause someone killed your parents. 'Cause of you, that girl just lost hers. Wait. What did you do? How do we find the girl? I have absolutely no idea. You don't know where we're going? Yeah, I guess I missed the guided tour? What, I would've thought you'd be used to walking around in a bit of a fog by now. - Watch it. - Someone's a bit cranky today, Let's just find the girl so you can hurry home and get amped up. I'm gonna get you out, okay? I'm gonna get you out of there. No, no, no, we're here to help and lead you out of here. We're looking for another little girl. She's 10, 11 years old. Naima. Her name is Naima. Upstairs? Right here. We're gonna be right back. Now, don't you move. We'll be back. You okay? Let's get the girls and get out of here. Naima? - Come on. - Come on. - Yo, chummy. - Take the girls. Get behind me. The littles be promised to Staggie. You want one, you cash with him. - Who is Staggie? - Staggie Steyns. Tell you what? You come back later. They got one eye, he cash you cheap. What do you mean one eye? Just like Staggie. He make them look like he got. Sawa! No more Pretty Face? We're out of time, Sawa. Oh, jeez. Okay, come on. Come on. Sawa! Sawa. Staggie. Where do I find Staggie? Go to Fun Huis. Staggie, he find you, Pretty Face. Late for class? So, you knew my parents? So, what, we knew each other? You were totally into me. Don't even. - Thanks for the joyride. - Sawa! Stop. Zoom in. Closer. Give me the disk. I'll run it through facial recognition. Thanks. Fun house. ...go to Fun Huis. Staggie. Staggie Steyns. Staggie. Hello. Hi. Hey. No, that's... You know, if the Thornhills want quality... ...give them quality. We don't pimp no Numbers trash. We've come up in the world, like Kratsov. You wanna go downstairs, kidnap some s-s-skirt, and get s-s-snuffed like Kratsov? For what? Plenty of little chickens out there we can get for a handful of f-f-feed. See, that's why I run this operation. You don't know nothing about retail markup. And you do. Sorry, my bad. Get out. Oh, damn it. You Staggie Steyns? No, he's Staggie Steyns. What? No, I'm S-S-S-Sascha. I'm Sascha. Tell the truth, bro. D-d-d-do it. Do it! I know who you are. Tell me about the Emir's shipment. Get me the hell out of here! Move it! - Boss, let's go! - Stay here! Get me out. I want her head in a sandwich bag. No wallet. We were interrupted. Oh, yeah. You want to know about the Emir's shipment. No problem. Tomorrow night, four girls, main container yard. But, hey, you want in? Let Daddy arrange it for you. - What time? - Okay, okay. 10:00. How are they coming in? Meat truck. Three officers need emergency assistance northbound on quadrant three flyover. All units in the vicinity are asked to respond immediately. Shots are being fired. Yo, cheeky prawn. You got something what belong to us. We want it back? Or we clap you one. Happy to return it. I'm not talking about no ball, doffhead. Money girl. She be promised to us. Get him! ...is now underway. All persons within the vicinity of this address are advised to seek immediate shelter. Anyone remaining at the scene will be arrested... Aker... I've seen the evidence inside. They're analyzing the girl's clothes and the shells. It looks like the same weapon that was used to kill Kratsov. He killed them. Get on the shipment. Container yard. You're late. - Not my fault. - Stay on schedule. Wake up. Get up. Get up. Move it. Hey, hey. Hey! Let me see what's going on in there. What are you doing here? Got her, Doc. Freeze. - Hey, drop it! - Put it down! You've been looking for me, I understand. Difficult to slip in as a girl when the cargo consists of boys. A bit of misinformation here and there... ...leads to some interesting results. Doesn't it? Miss... Sawa. Such an unusual name. My father... Sawa. My father said that it meant the sound that you couldn't hold... ...and the feather blown by the wind. A poet. A cop. An unfortunate occupation in this part of the world. Well, you would know. You killed him. Emir. And you killed Clive Thornhill, Miss Sawa. Among many of my other clients, it would seem. You talk about them like they're businessmen. Oh, but they are. Who do you suppose buys children, the poor? No. It is business, Miss Sawa. And I control that business by sitting at the choke hold of what gets out of this godforsaken ruin of a country. Mr. Thornhill. Is this the young lady you're seeking? Shamil. - Come here, you... - You'll have your turn, Mr. Thornhill. But first she needs to talk. Oh, I'll make her bloody squeal. Shamil. Do you see this, Miss Sawa? Russian soldiers dragged me into a local shop in Chechnya... ...and deep-fried my hand. They then chopped it into little bits and made everyone in the village eat a piece for having given me shelter. An effective method to get people to talk, I can assure you. Now is there something you want to tell us? Like the name of your employer, perhaps? The person behind the killings that's been disrupting my business for years. I'd like to tell you... ...I'm gonna take my earring back. And then I'm gonna kill every one of you. Oh, skip the bleeding hors d'oeuvres, shall we, and get on with it. I don't give fuck-all square about your hand, love. I've known many policemen, Miss Sawa. Most, once they were paid, we found to be reasonable. Perhaps your father, whom I honestly do not recall, was unreasonable. Do you really wish to follow that same course? It's genetic, I guess. Oi! Hey, hey, hey. What's going on here? Mommy! You can both testify he removed evidence? Yes, Captain. I told you, he's been protecting someone for years. Then let's find out who the girl is. Hey. Hey, you're okay. You're okay. It's just withdrawals. The man who shot them... I saw his face. It was burned. You're sick. You've been off the amp for days. Here. I found you one. No, no. I remember now. It wasn't the Emir. It was the Emir and the Emir's dead. You can't trust your own mind right now, Sawa. He's still out there, Karl. The man you're remembering is just a gunman. I need to know, Karl. Listen... the cops, I'm... I'm worried. I've had to clean up too much. We need to find him, Karl. Look, I need to move you. We've run out of rope, do you understand? What difference does it make? We won! The man who caused all this is dead. Now take the amp so we can get out of here. I can't, Karl. I can't lose them a second time. The boy? With the hood? There's a surveillance tape. Don't worry, I destroyed it like everything else, but if you want to know about the gunman... ...he can tell you. - What do you mean? - Ask him! I can't do this anymore. Karl? Karl! The man who killed my parents. How do you know who he is? Is that what Aker told you? Look, I'm not talking to you. He's got you back on the amp. You'll forget everything I say. I'm going clean. I want to remember. Oh, you want the whole story? Let's go? Right, of course. Why have a conversation when you can stab someone? That's what you think, isn't it? We were friends, Sawa. You and me. We were friends. This is as far as I go. No, you're not locking me in some hole. I'm not going in there. I can't. You can stick me with your little girly knife, if you want to. I'm not going in there. You keep saying that, you'll take all the fun out of the idea. Please. The gun on the table is for you. I knew you. Your father was a... ...friend and a colleague. This is who I was. Officer Breedlove. Otis Breedlove. That was before the... ...sulfur mustard. A blister agent. I don't understand. That's the point. A person with no sense of history isn't a person. Just another... ...number in the body count. When the banks failed and the government collapsed, state weaponry of every description disappeared, sold to whoever paid the highest price for it. What are you talking about? About what happened to your mother and your father, to you. You killed my parents. No. But I bear responsibility for their deaths. Weapons were being stolen from our unit and I had discovered who was doing it. I was going to report it and then my house was bombed, my wife killed, and if I didn't keep quiet, my son would be harmed, and so... I-I-I had to admit that there was someone else in our unit who knew what I knew. Someone in the unit. My father? Yes, I identified your father. But I didn't shoot him. My boy was used to ring the bell. - I was forced inside. - Mommy! All of this, your whole life, it's all been about erasing one man's transgression. The man who took your memory from you and replaced it with a past he created to get you to do whatever he wanted. Get to work. It was you. You rang the bell. He's your father. He's dying. He wanted us both to know the truth. That's why I had to find you. - Sawa, what we did... - No, you didn't do anything. You were a child. We both were. Quick. Sawa, Oburi, come. Sawa, disarm the bag. Yo, chummy. Mag, too, Pretty Face. Dart filled with amp. This is not amp. You remember Mandla and Margrit, right? Unsavory company, I agree. But I had to do something about Pillay. He was a cop. If he'd ID'd her, it could've led them to me. This could've been all over, but your father had to go and crawl up out of the grave. Still making problems, hey? - Open the door. - It's unlocked. You can open it yourself, mate. Mandla. No! Otis, my man. Your sentimental attachment to that old-school weapon limits you to just two shots. Yes, but it's the only shot I've ever wanted. Stop, Sawa. Or I'll cut him down. Yeah, you're good at that, it seems. Your father was gonna rat me out. Yes, I stole the weapons. Yes, I sold them. Everybody in state security was doing that. I made a mistake. But I spent the rest of my life paying it back. Cleaning up the streets when the cops, the courts, and everybody else was too weak to do anything about it. I spent those years trying to bring justice to the man responsible. Karl, you're the man responsible. Yeah, you're right. I betcha it did sound good, though, didn't it? I coulda killed you, Sawa, or sold you. Or left you in the streets for the Numbers to pick over. But I took care of you. I owed that to your father. Since he's not around to return the favor, I'm gonna do it for him. Sawa... Dad? You all right? Look at you. I made a monster. A beautiful monster. Come. Nobody... could've infiltrated... a flesh-cartel but you. Together, we could have all of this tomorrow. Without the Emir, it's all ours. Finally, Karl... Something comes out of your mouth that isn't a lie. How much amp do you suppose that is? I don't know, Captain, but I'm guessing you'll have a hard time getting the name of the girl out of him now. Faster, Sawa! Faster! Look at you. I created a monster. A beautiful monster. A monster A beautiful monster... I made a monster. You made me a monster Beautiful monster You made me A monster... Look at you. A monster You made me a monster... I created a monster. A beautiful... ...monster. A beautiful A monster A monster A beautiful monster... I created a monster. A beautiful... Monster... A beautiful. A beautiful. I made a monster. A beautiful monster. Look at you. I created a monster. You made me a monster A beautiful monster Monster. Monster Monster A beautiful monster A monster Monster A beautiful monster... Monster. A beautiful monster Monster... A beautiful. Monster... Look at you. I made a monster. A beautiful monster. Monster Monster A beautiful monster Monster A monster... Look at you. Monster A beautiful monster... I created a monster. A beautiful monster.
