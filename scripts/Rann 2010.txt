Bomb blast has become so common a thing in the country... That instead of it beinga breaking news... It No longer qualifies to be called even a mere news... Once again the anger of Hindus in our Nation reach it's boiling point... Everyone is pointing finger at the muslims staying in the country... Once again it is being said... ...that if ever there can be any relation between hindusand muslim... ...then it can be only of Hatred... I would like to ask a question... to all of you... and to myself too... Samir khan beinga film superstar Rules over the hearts of millions... In his films he is so often praised by Hindus... To his millions of fans I would like to ask... Are you not aware as to which religion Samir Khan belongs to? If we are to believe in this ongoing thought... That despise and disagreement can be the only bond between the two communities... Then by the same rationale... Samir Khan should have become this country's biggest enemy... There are many people who are popular amongst the Hindus... Andthere are many names whom the Muslims respect too... The Fanatic Thinking of a select few opportunists is... 'Communal Hatred' This is something we all are aware of... and understand it too... Then why do we let this become our line of thought? Why? Just think about it... Wish you would love me as much as you love Vijay Harshvardhan Mallik... God you are obsessed with the man... Not Obsessed... ljust respect him... And you must too... Hello, I am very busy in my life... I don't have time to respect anyone... I know... More then country's problems you are more interested in movie gossips... So? What's wrong? Gossip isatleast entertaining... Ok. Let's not start thisagain... I still cannot believe... I am joining Vijay sir's channel from tomorrow... Oh God not again... gimme a break Purab... Ok I'm leaving... see you later... Have a good day... Today we have an Ad shoot for holay holay hair remover... ...am goingto be late tonight so make some food... and please... Not your favourite vegetable dish Bitter Gourd... Bye... - Bye... 9 monthsago the most brutal terrorist attack ever, happened in country... responsible ministersassured to tighten country's security system... ...andtoday again a bomb blast... Even after so many attacks... has our system not learnt anythingfrom it's mistakes? Or is it that our mistakes have transformed into becoming a habit... ...or helplessness... If it is so then this very status of ours is much more dangerous then terrorism. Your dad is just terrific... Much dangerous... Ya he is... Just think about it... - But the channel is not... What?? Dadfeels, media's solemn duty is to serve the public... So... isn't he right? But if the doctor himself falls ill... ...how will he treat the diseased? What do you mean? Our channel is turning into a sick unit Yas... Lime and cola doesn't wish to renewtheir deal with us... our TRPs have fallen to an all time low... That new show we were launching... Common Man... what's happening on it? Headlines 24 has just yesterday launched a show... The show is called... ...'Ordinary Man'... Sir you are aware that in todays times ideasare few and competition high... ...and every personsa walking spy camera... it's very difficult to keep a secret... ...and it's possible they too might have thought this very same idea... I don't knowthese things are hard to tell... I would like you to take a look at this Sir... Yas in todays times... business doesn't run on principals... But jai... media is not just a business... You are missing the point... Just as soap garments etc are a business... News channel isa business too... It needs money investment... And wherever money is invested... ...there can be only one objective... To Make Money... But jai... everyone regards you father highly... then where's the problem? Not everyone... Only educated people like you... That makes no difference to my channel business though... Andthis top ranking channel... Headlines 24... The person who runs it is neither terrific like my Dad... Nor doesanyone respect him... Despite of that isn't he high above? Ruling... on top. Idiot... Who? Afew yearsago he was a mere employee with us... Amrish Khakkar... Now I realize, the kind of donkeys I've been breeding in my channel... Instead of Headlines 24... You all should be in India 24 x 7 with Vijay Harshvarddhan Mallik... How many times I 've said, convert News into spice and Sell... And listen... Get rid of these plain looking women... ...instead bring in beautiful models... ...take them to a beach... put them in skimpy clothes... ...and them let them speak about the weather analysis... who wish to hear will listen... who wish to see will watch... Remember, presentation is everything... Presentation is not everything... Media's purpose is to evaluate the truth regarding the information and... ...present it to the public. Maybe because of our principles... ...we are lagging behindas compared to other channels but... ...This is not a race... If we have to review ourselves... we should question ourselves as to... ...how honest... howtalented... how un-biased we are. The answer to these questions is what India 24/7 stands on... ...and will remain standing... Hi Dad... The necessity that... ...Prime minister Hooda was feeling since many months has today been fulfilled... What necessity Dad? Since a long time Hooda has been sayingthat our country... ...to fight against terrorism... ...needs a much more forceful law than the existing one. But the opposition leader Mohan Pandey doesn't agree with him... However after todays bomb blast the opinion pollsare saying... ...that the people of the country support Hooda. What do you feel Dad? - I have faith in Hooda... After many years the country has got a leader like him... I like him yup... I'll get back to you... yes... I said I'll get back to you... Your Brother in law wishes that... ...India 24/7 should... ...praise his company I'll speak to him dad... Today morning Prime Minister Digvijay Hooda visited Muzaffarnagar... ...and inspectedthe site where the bomb blast took place. It'sa great mistortune that the innocent people have died in this blast... ...andtheir family members, but it isa much greater misfortune of mine... ...that despite knowing the solution to the problem... I can do nothing. What greater misfortune could there be? To fight against terrorism this country needs... ...a tough anti terror act. If we Don't understand this now... ...then we never will. I don't know how many more times will we keep punishing the countrymen... ...for our stupidity, in the form of these attacks Under the circumstancesalong with the Prime Minister... ...the entire nation feels the need for tough measures... Despite of this... ...the opposition party leader Mr. Mohan Pandey is vehemantly opposingthe bill. It'sa Sham... This bill is an outright Sham. Taking advantage of the bomb blast... it'sa novel ploy of Hooda to seize complete authority of power... Mr. Hooda isalready busy preparing... ...plans to get the bill passed as soon as possible... ...so that his government can at once begin abusing law and order... The truth is... that Mr. Hooda is trying... ...to take unfair advantage of the situation of fear in the country... ...this country does not need a new law... It requires tougher measures... Mr. Hooda's scheme to become Hitler... ...shall face our full protest with all our might... Andthe award for the best actor goes to... Mr. Mohan Pandey... Cheers. Pandey may have his say... but after the bomb blast the Public sentiment... ...seems to be leaning in favor of Hooda Prime Minister Digvijay Hooda will definitely confront this problem and succeed. He has got the people of the country's unshakable faith and support. These Media now a daysare rather noisily beating Hooda's drum. What do you feel? What will happen? Hmmmm... Naveen, ask what all won't happen. If Hooda's charm continuesat this rate... ...I will never be able to become the prime minister... ...and you... ...will never be able to remove your cousin brother... ...to become the number one Industrialist. What do we do? We will have to do something... Hmmmm... We will have to do something... But what? I feel what Mohan Pandey says isabsolutely right... Hooda is just fooling the country... Please Nandita... What do you know about Pandey? ...Or for that matter about Hooda? I don't believe... People just mindlessly form opinions without thinking as to who is what... ...pandey isa idiot... come on Purab... be fair... I mean the guy isa popular leader. I can't you understand? What isa leader? Like you and me, he is just another working employee... not obliginganyone... ...and Nandita, the thing is... a country functionsaccordingto a system... ...and you and me are just parts of it... I give up Purab I give up... ...I can never win an argument with you... ok bye... umm... wait... wait... wait... ...This will give you company in office... and your lunch... bye... ...have a good day... every street is loudly proclaiming... all the leadersare robbers. Now every street is loudly proclaiming... All leadersare robbers... They do not value Allah or Ram. They do not Value Allah or Ram. Andthe people are cheated... India... India... India... India...

You know somethingJay... it's a goodthing... that you came back from America... Channel needs you... Mallik Sir is getting old... After all... Son steps in fathers shoes. Right? It sounds like a great title... Son steps in fathers shoes. Launch another show in your channel... you'll get more TRP. Ya... thanks for the idea... even though it's mine. Son steps in fathers shoes... Andas things are... ...India 24/7 is just not usedto great TRP. Why Don't you just shut up? Oh Jay... this is not happening. You know... Such attitude... doesn't suit losers... you should be careful when you talk... or else... ...the people, whom you have borrowed all the money from... ...I just have to make them a phone call... and you with your channel ...will be out on streets... Idiot. - Jay... Jay what are you doing... Jay... Let goJay... Leave it... I love you too man... Ma'am, Pleasure meeting you. Are you ok? - I'm fine. I'm fine... - Ya... Can you please get me a drink? Yes... - Thanks. If you want it... Amrish kakkar will never again dare speak with you this way... If you want it... If you want it India 24/7'sTRPs will become so high... ...it would wipe out Headlines 24 completely... If you really want it. If you really want it... ...then alongwith India 24/7... ...Entire Indian Media will be under your control. How? How? This... Muzzaffarnagar... Bomb blast that recently happened... Do you know... who hasactually did it? Digvijay Hooda. It'sa clever plot of his... to plant fear in hearts of people... and use it to get the new bill passed. How can you be so sure... ...that Hooda has done it? Hooda has not done itJay... ...it should seem like he's done it. What do you mean? I mean the world has changed. Earlier TVchannel's used to show incidents that happened. They usedto report. But now... intelligence andtechnology... both have evolved to such an extent... You can actually create news. That's where you come in Jay. But accordingto the law... it's treason. - Law... Laws were not made by God sittingabove in heaven... Laws were made here on land. To prevent ordinary men from becoming great men... Some very special people... ...like me... ...have made these laws... And while makingthem great care was taken... ...that we don't get trapped by them. You seeJay... we have 6 other channels... who are willingto do anything for this offer. Right, Pandey? - Um Hmmm 6 other channels. But we want India 24/7 to report this. Why? When you want to bring down the Country's most reputed leader... ...put against him the country's most reputed media personality... ...and we have a winner... ...in this case... ...its your Dad. Jay, by the time things are investigated... It will be too late. But if your Dad... whom everyone regards as the country's cleanest... ...most Reputed Journalist... ...when he will report this... It will shatter people's faith in Hooda. Jay you needTRPs. Besides the 30 crore loan that you have taken from the market... ...We will pay it off... ...andthat's not all... Pandey promises to give you... Another 100 crores. Yes. Ideal Deal is one which benefits both. All your troubles will be over in one shot... Think about it... One more thing... ...if your stupidity... ...or your conscience... ...stops you from joining us... ...you better stop your tongue too... because there are some reasons... why I am the Mohan Pandey... Where did you go? You know how many times I called you? And you were just not picking up. Jay So, what's wrong, Jay? Jay... Jay what happened? You made the right decision. Now we have to arrange for a man... whom we can show alongwith Atul Kumar Dubey. All of India knows it. If Atul kumar Dubey is Hooda's man... Why would he favor us? With a gun pointing on your head... ...you can make anyone say anything. Gun point? Let Pandey handle all that... ok? But... - Hmmm? We can't hold him at Gun point for ever... No... of course not... of course not... But Pandey will come out with some say to do it... By threatningto kill his family members... ...or offer him pots of money or use some other pressure... Whatever... whatever... whatever... ...See... ...by then our job will be done... Believe me... Pandey is much more experienced in these matters than us. ...he knowsa lot... ok... Trust me. Because I trust Pandey. But brother-in-law, will this look real? Sometimes you make me laugh. You're a Media person. Do you know howfilmsare made? Just think... that you are goingto make a film. Ok? Ashort film. A 5 minute short film. - No spice... No song... No dance... Straight to the point. Don't worry... Last Night in the Muzzaffarnagar bomb blast case... ...a criminal called Abdul has been arrested... Accordingto Police, Abdul named a person called Khanna duringthe interrogation... Abdul confessedthat Khanna had paid him 50 lacs for this job... Police is now searchingfor Khanna... But who is this Khanna? Dad... Guess what I got? Hooda Sir was little nervous. And he was tensedthat mission will be succeeded or not? But these news channel made so much noise... ...that our job was done. So is Hooda happy now? Very happy... - What isall thisJay? I was shocked too dad. He told me give khanna another 5 crore". He is the same Khanna that everyone is searchingfor dad. Same guy. You will get the money soon Khanna... Thank you Dubey... Where did you findthis CD? Some one sent it dad... Addresed to me... I mean... ...andtell Hooda if he wants something done again... do remember Khanna... We should air this Right Now Dad. - No... No... No... What? - To accuse a leader like Hooda is not a... What you talking dad? What are you talking dad? It's obvious from this that Hooda made that bomb blast happen... ...and thisAtul Kumar Dubey, who is talking with Khanna... ...is one of Hooda's special guys. Every one knows that. Everybody knows that... including you. Ya but without any proof how can you? - What proof dad? What proof are you talkingabout dad? What proof are you talkingabout? Which proof are you talking about? We are Media people dad... ...And it's our job to put what ever truth that we find in front of everyone... This is the truth dad... This is the truth. And dad... by the way... ...whoever has sent us this tape... ...it's quite possible... rather I am sure that... ...he must have sent this truth to other channels too... Dad... ...we are running out of time... ...running out of time dad... Not for me... Not for yourself... ...not for India 24/7... ...but only for the people of the country... you have to expose thisat once dad. You owe this to the country dad... You... owe... this... to the country. Dad? Ya... Yes Dad. Government is on the verge of acquiring unlimited power... ...in order to tackle crime andterrorism. It'sa matter of pride that the prime minister of the country ...has tightened his belt to tackle terrorism... But I am sadto say this... ...that all this was just a facade... a trick... a lie... What you are about to see now... ...isactual terrorism... it is the fearful aspect of Indian Political scenario. Which is more terrifying then terrorism. India 24/7 presents... 'Atruth' Hooda had become nervous and unsure... ...he said "not even 100 people die?" The purpose why we didthis bomb blast will it be fulfilled? But the channels made such a big noise that our job was done... So is Hooda happy now? Very happy... he told me "give Khanna another 5 crore" - wow... It will reach along with this... Thank you Dubey... This is just great... and tell Hooda Sir if he needs to do something again... ...then remember khanna... - Sure I will sir. We all know who Atul Kumar Dubey is... Member of Parliament... ...and the most loyal oldfriend of Digvijay Hooda since many years... All this makes it a good enough reason for us... to believe every wordthat Dubey spoke for his friend Hooda... Do we have any other choice besides believing it? Ya... - Why didnt I get this tape? I didnt know about thisat all... I had no clue... oh shit... Today I wont plead you to think... I am confident... That you have seen everything... ...absorbed it... ...and understood it too. In breaking news today we will show you a video clip... The Whole Nation is in a state of shock... The facts exposed by India 24/7 has shaken the public andthe VIPs... Digvijay Hooda's one of those chosen few leaders... ...who had built a clean I'm age of an ideal politican... ...on the platform of Indian politics. But now that I'm age has been shatteredto pieces. The picture that has surfaced of prime minister Digvijay Hooda... ...is certainly fearsome. Vijay Harshvardhan Mallik and his son Jay Mallik... ...under whose supervision this operation was executed... ...has caused tremors through the political world. We have just been informed that the police has found... ...member of parliament and Digvijay Hooda's dear friend... Atul kumar Dubey's corpse. He has been murdered. I Don't know any Khanna. But do you accept that you knew Atul Kumar Dubey? Atul Kumar Dubey, was one of my close friends. Atul Kumar Dubey was your friend... ...and Khanna was his friend... ...so doesn't friend of a friend, become your friend too? No. Absolutely not. For a moment let'sassume... ...that Atul Kumar Dubey knew Khanna... ...then it doesn't necessarily mean that... ...I too wasassociated with Khanna. In our breaking news Digvijay Hooda acceptedthe truth. Hear it once again... carefully... Atul Kumar Dubey, was one of my close friends. ...was one of my close friends. I too wasassociated with Khanna... Atul Kumar Dubey knew Khanna... Atul Kumar Dubey was his close friend. The prime character of Prime minister Digvijay Hooda's sting operation... Khanna is missing. Entire Nation is put on stand... where is Khanna? This revelation has ripped open the curtains... ...coveringthe corrupt political links Is Khanna really missing? ...or is he being hidden? The famous film maker Bobby Bhatt hasannounced... ...that his next film is entirely based on this scandal. Sir we are again asking you, where is Khanna? Welcome to our programme special 'Who is Khanna'. The biggest character of this entire conspiracy... Khanna... where is he? Hooda repeatedly claims he does not know anybody called Khanna. After the startling revelations made on Vijay Harshvardhan Mallik's India 24/7... Digvijay Hooda's throne is in danger. The more deadly a crime, the more dangerous methodsare used to hide it. And when the person responsible for collapse of the government disappears. Then you can judge the extent to which the criminal has gone. Where is Khanna? But more than that, its necessary to ask... who is Khanna? Dubey and Khanna... Their existance could have become dangerous for us. That's is why Pandey had to... Jay... There are two kind of people in this world. Lions... and Lambs. In order to rule... it's necessary for Lion to sacrifice few lambs. You want to be a Lion or a lamb? You have to make this decision for yourself. But, after you make the decision... It would only be stupidity... to waste time on lambs. Get me a drink... it'sa battle... it'sa battle. It'sa battle... it'sa battle... it'sa battle. Wow, I have never seen your Vijay Sir this happy before. Purab? What happened? What happened? Khanna was present at Vijay Sir's party. Who Khanna? That... Hooda's man? I saw him at the party. But, how can you be so sure? When I saw him on TV I got a feeling I had definitely seen him somewhere before. Then I remembered I had seen him at Vijay Sir's party. Purab have you gone mad? How can you be so confident that Khanna was present at that party. These are few photographs of the party... Vijay Sir or one of his family members might have invited him to the party. Or maybe he came alongwith some guest. With whom? Maybe with Mohan Pandey. No... Purab, listen to me. There's no needto play sherlock holmes in this mess. Police is searchingfor Khanna... let them do their job. You just do your job. Better still leave this job. Purab did you hear what I said? Who besides Mohan Pandey gets the maximum benefit of Hooda being removed? We were searchingfor terrorists outside the country... ...as we did not expect them to be right here amongst us. We trusted him with our safety and the future of the country. And he did this? To tell you the truth... ...I am deeply ashamed to stand here in front of all of you... No, I have done nothing... I am not guilty... But yet I find it difficult to hold my head up... Since I too am a leader. Andthis word 'leader' is now associated with traitors like Hooda. You might be thinking I have come here to ask for your votes... No... I do not want your vote. Mohan Pandey does not want Vote. Mohan Pandey does not want Politics. Does not want to be a leader. Does not even want the throne. Then what does this Mohan Pandey want? Mohan Pandey wants... ...this country to be safe from Hounds like Hooda. That's it. Today the country does not need this Mohan Pandey. But Mohan Pandey needs this country... Acountry where there is peace in the hearts... and truth on it's lips. "Pandey does not need votes..." "Pandey does not need votes..." Telecast this speech every 10 minutes. Through out the day... hmm? Pandey Does not want Leadership... Does not want this chair either It looks as if India 24/7 has turned into... ...a private PR channel for Mohan Pandey. After Hooda's scandal Pandey's Popularity has increased dad... People want to hear more of him... People want to see him... ...and I think we are just showing people what they want to see. There's... I Don't see anything wrong with that. Besides he's getting us great ratings... And dad... umm... ...There's nothing at all... as it seems to you... I think we are all ok. See you around dad. Dad... uh... ...There's something I wanted to speak with you about... Can I? - Um... hmm I had introduced you to a girl on your birthday party... Yas. Yashoda... You remember her? - Ya. Uh... I want to marry her... I love her... ...and um... ...and she'sa Muslim. Marriage is not just about boy and girl... ...itsabout their families too... it's not onlyJay she has to be with... She has to be part of us too... I wont let a girl from another faith to be part of... What do you know about her faith? As far as I know... you have never readthe Quran... Why should I read it? All I know is, our religionsare different... Then will you tell me what's different between usand her? What do you mean "what's different"? We go to temple... they go to mosque... We celebrate Diwali while they celebrate... ...Eid... ...they celebrate Eid. Just like you like wearing a Sari, Priya doesn't... You don't like spice in your dal curry and Naveen... Naveen does not even like dal curry... We all are of the same religion... then why are we so different? Don't try to manipulate me with your thoghts... ...Its not about thoughts Lata. ...Itsabout understanding... We are different people... We have our own way of living... ...every 'way' isa religion... Naveen accordingto his religion... ...me according to mine... you accordingto yours ...and Yasmin accordingto her religion... ...are living life... There are no Hindus or Muslims... ...there are only 'People'. Just understandthat you are not just beingagainst muslims... ...you are also being against Jay's love... Hail India... Hail Hail India... Hail India... Hail Hail India... Hail India... Hail Hail India... 90 out of 100are bloody dishonest... Commit animal fodder scams... yet walk proud. 90 out of 100 are bloody dishonest... Commit animal fodder scams... yet walk proud. The ones with might... their wrongs become right... My India is Great... India is Great... My India is Great... Praise it... Praise it...

One contests election while in jail... give me Vote... Give me vote... Give me vote... other buys votesand movesahead... - Thank you Aleader speaks the truth... "only when he callsanother leader a liar" My India is Great... I love... My India is Great I love my India Gandhi... Gandhi... Gandhi... Gandhi... Gandhi... Salute... Salute... Four Khannas came to the party... But the Khanna everyone is searchingfor is not amongst them... That means Khanna came to the party along with some guest... Or maybe Khanna is not his real name at all... Why wouldanybody use his real name for such an operation? Purab have you gone mad? Don't you know how dangerous people like Mohan Pandey are? They will finish you off and no one will ever come to know. Just... just like they whisked off Khanna... ...they will whisk you off too Please Purab if not for yourself... For my sake please stop all this... ...and what's worse is that India 24/7... Just goes on praising that Monster Pandey. I can't believe it... We are not talkingabout the movie karz (debt)... that Subhash Ghai directed... ...and recently Himesh Reshammiya acted in. We are talkingabout the debt in which you and me are slowly drowning in... ...Iook very very closely around you my friends... you'll realize the credit card companies have become our financiers... ...and we are entrapped by their smart marketing and have become 'debtors' and that's not all... ...some of the companiesare hiring underworldto recover debts... You will never know when a AK47 totting Goon... Will pop up in front of you... ...andthen pop you off... Keep watching our special feature... Bleed dry... become paupers... in this debt.

Farmers who are committing suicides... We have heardthat too before Pandey sir... Hmm... Terrorism... I declare against it'sa... - We have heard this too Pandey Sir. Say something new...

Since 1972till today... 102 cases are registered against you... amongst them... 34 are criminal cases... 25 land dispute cases... ...andthe rest are fraud and foreign exchange violations. What could be the reason... ...that so many casesare registered against a clean national worker like you? What's your name son? - Purab. Tell me your full name son...

You are just an employee, behave like an employee... When Instructionsare Given to you Just follow them. Nalini... ...Send somebody else to interview Pandey. ...and just dump this man's interview. And consider this warning as my last Mr. Purab... Last. You must understand... that at the end of the day you and I are just employees. What can we do? Khanna... Khanna was present at Vijay sir's party. - What? Yes... The very same Khanna who isaccused in Hooda scandal. He was there at Vijay Sir's birthday party. But Sir hasasked on TV, "Who is Khanna"? If sir doesn't know Khanna then what was he doingat his party... Purab... ...did you tell this to anyone else? Thank God. Look Purab, this isa very sensitive issue ok? Don't speak about this to anyone without asking me. Voting countdown has begun. The nation is weighing... Whom to hand over the country's future. The Opinion polls or the popularity have their predictions... But one thing is certain... ...the only deserving candidate for the Prime Ministers chair is... Mohan Pandey.

Rules Mohan Pandey will be speaking... Afew words of appreciation for Jay Mallik from India 24/7. I am certain that Khanna has ties not only with Pandey, but Jay Mallik too. Jay is launching 2 more channels. Inside buzz is that Pandey is funding it. Hooda's elimination brought a huge advantage to Pandey... and it's bringing benefits toJay too. And it's bringing benefits toJay too. I'II? No you tell him that i will meet him at uh... ok... just hold on a second please hmm? Uh... Jay can I call you back please? - Brother-in-law, wait... Jay, what is it? I got an SMS... - SMS from whom? Khanna... - who Khanna? What who khanna... the same one. Khanna. But that's not possible... umm... ok... hold on, I'll confirm it with Pandey... hold on... Listen I'll have to call you back. Ok? Bye... ya... tell me Naveen... PandeyJay called me. He said he got a message from Khanna. Which Khanna? - Pandey, the same Khanna... I killed him myself. - Are you sure? Pandey are you sure? Are you sure? Could he be alive? Jay it's Impossible. - Then who could it be? Then who could it be Pandey? How can I say about how many Khanna's, Jay might be knowing? Er... could it be some other Khanna? I know just one Khanna. Pandey, Jay knows only one Khanna. Tell Jay to relax. - Jay... Jay relax... - But... But Pandey... - Relax, Don't worry. Umm... ok ok pandey... Jay... Just relax ok... What happened Jay? Oh Yas... I just needto go somewhere urgently... you take a taxi and go home. - But what happened? Nothing... I mean... ljust need to go somewhere so... - But tell me somethingatleast. I just needto go somewhere why Don't you? Alright... I'll see you later... I'm sorry... Take care... Purab... it's me, Nalini... Uh... somebody wants to meet you. Nalini was praising you a lot. She told me that you... ...regard Mallik sir as your Ideal. I also usedto... ...and more than you. The moment camera rolled... ...he became the messiah of the nation. Sitting in the studio he usedto act... ...as if he is running a social service organisation instead of a channel. Purab my rationale tells me... ...Hooda is innocent. Someone has playeda smart move... Which has brought benifits to him... ...andthe sinking India 24/7. India 24/7 was going bankrupt... but look now... Father son together are winningawardafter award. ...andthe talk is on to launch 2 more channels. I just wish to tell you... That you are not alone against this sham. Nalini told me you are making investigations on your own. If you findany proof. Give it to my channel, I will rip open the truth... Purab... Don't just look at the truth andthink about it... When it's needed... Speak it out. Shameless... honorless... ...you have become a living corpse... Drenched in fire, yet you will remain wet. Even if God comes down... You wont change Seeingthis... My blood boils. Purab... I know Amrish is not completely clean. But to expose the truth, you will have to take help of some channel. And if the truth happens to contain lies of India 24/7... Then Amrish is the best you have at the moment. Just think about it Purab... You don't have much time... Give it a thought... Khanna wasJay's man. Purab... Now watch... ...How I take on Pandey, Jay and Mallik... All these years they were roamingaround with masks... ...I will tear them off their faces forever. ...you just watch my showtonight... Just watch and enjoy how I pull everybody's pants down. How much do you want? 500 crore. Don't you think it'sa bit too much? Don't you think it's too less for a price of a Nation? There's one more copy lying with my channel. If I do not reach back... ...things will reach public. I like you. I like you more. ...But there was one more truth... ...that never came out. ...that was Mohan Pandey's truth. Mohan Pandey was the only leader ...who had gauged Hooda's designs of corruption and selfishness much earlier. ...This election Victory is his well deserved reward. If there is one person who truly deserves to sit on PM's chair... ...Its only Mohan Pandey. Headlines 24 wishes Mohan Pandey... - what is he saying? Heartiest congratulations for this victory... God. What a nonsense! Hey hey... Purab. Relax. I thought a lot. What do we gain by exposing Pandey? Few days of great TRPs... our channel will once again become number one. Right... ok... excellent... fantastic... that's what we want... ...But... ...doesall of that compare to 500 crore? Surprised, aren't you? I know... 500 crore... its... 500 crores isa huge huge amount I opened my mouth and asked what I wanted. Can you blame me for it? But think... ...Why would this pandey Give me so much money? Why? You know why? Because even the smallest kick back of a large project scam... ...runs into thousands and crores of rupees. Now if the PM of the country... ...turns out to be a smart player... ...just think how much he will make in the 5 year test match. It's unbelievable... ...And Pandey will get that same bill passed. ...Poor Hooda... ...He truly wantedto get the bill passed to increase the nations security. Instead now Pandey will get the very same bill passedand become country's king. ...It'sa fantastic game my friend. Don't you understand it? Andthese Pandey's buddies, Naveen Shaukalya and Jay Mallik... ...they are all ready and set to loot this country. The Minute Pandey becomes PM... ...Naveen Shankalya will turn around the Industry policies... ...so that it benifits him and only him... ...and then his dream... ...to remove his elder brother... ...and become Indias Number 1 Industrialist will be fulfilled. ...Andas for Jay Mallik... ...without him... this entire operation was impossible. Do you know... while Pandey's men held Dubey on gun point... ...Jay Mallik himself... ...directed Khanna and Dubey on that tape. Can you believe it? And you know what? ...now Jay is goingto Launch many more channels... ...andall those channels... ...will be in favor of Mohan Pandey... Oh boy... You know Purab you are talented... ...you are young, you are talented... But... ...Talent alone is not enough Purab... It's not enough. One must know the right place to apply ones talents. ...you should know where to use it... you just don't start butting in anywhere anytime... No You use it sensibly. If you want... ...you can have a bungalow for yourself in one week. ...lf you want instead of this bike you can travel in a posh car... ...lf you want... ...you can produce that film for your dear girlfriend. All you got to do is... 'decide'. That's it. It's all in your hands... here... here... from that 500 I will Give you 10 crores... ...besides it's thanks to you that I am getting the 500 crores And if you want a job in my channel... Whatever Job... Whatever salary... ...any salary... Fine with me. I need sharp minds like you. What about the people of the country? What? Which People? Yes Purab tell me which people? Those people who are thirsty for each other's blood... ...over petty issues like religon, caste... those people? They are all busy trying to make money... make a home... You are concerned about those people? Who don't care for others? Who don't care even for themselves. Why are you so bothered about their well being? Why should you care? Think about it... I am with you. Good that you understood. For otherwise even I coudn't save you from Mohan Pandey. Lata... ...is this fine? Since when have you startedto dress up? Why? What do you mean? ...He is my son and as his father I too have the right to look presentable. ...and please change this sari you have worn... ...its color clashes with my sherwani... Come Naveen Come... Naveen... Is this the time to come? Family shouldarrive before the guests. I am so... ...No No no I don't want any excuses. Naveen... can you just? ...can you just... Iook after the band andall the dancers and everything? Ya... I'll look... Hello Nalini... - Hello sir... I have to say that you are lookingabsolutely stunning. Congratulations to you Sir... - Thank you so much Trivedi... come here... What is this? It's... It'sa bouquet sir... - Speak in Hindi. It's... it'sa bouquet sir... Why bring such a large one? Er... I couldn't find smaller one. Had you found a smaller one you would have brought that? Yes sir... - Oh... It means you were goingto bring a small bouquet for my son's engagement? No... No Sir... I wanted to get one even larger than this Then why didnt you bring it? - Couldn't find it sir... Didnt find or didnt want to bring? No... No sir... why would I do such a thing? I respect Jay Sir the most. - Oh really... and not me? Tell me the truth... whom do you respect more? Me or Jay? Trivedi I was pulling your leg. Come on... Ok... Ok... come on in... Hey Purab... Come on... come on... come on... Come on... come on... What? Speak straight what you wish to say. Pandey didthe bomb blast. Not Hooda. What? If you do not know this... ...then possibly you also wouldn't know... ...that Khanna was not Hooda's man... ...He was your son Jay's man. ...and Naveen supported Jay on every step... whom all are you accusing? Have you gone mad? Not Mad... I've been fooled... And not only me... Entire nation is fooled by this circus created by India 24/7. For the past 10 years I have seen you... Heard you... read you... You inspired me to become a Journalist. ...and today I at a stage where I am suspecting you. But what do I do now? The evidence that I found left me with no other option. ...I thought... ...I thought you too are part of the scam. ...or maybe you convinced yourself about your son Jay... ...one should not point fingers at anyone without proper evidence. ...I learnt that from you sir. ...that's why I have brought one evidence for you. Maybe it has got something, that you don't know. Or Maybe it has got nothing, that you don't already know. If you think it's trash, just dump it. ...you want to burn it then do burn it. Till now I was convincedthat nothing can stop the truth from coming out. ...but not any more... I wont be surprised by anythingthat you decide. ...As I have reached my conclusion. I have lost the battle sir. That's why I quit. Not only India 24/7... butJournalism too. I thought a lot. What do we gain by exposing Pandey? Few days of great TRPs... our channel will once again become number one. ...But... ...doesall of that compare to 500 crore? Surprised, arent you? 500 crore... God... Itsa huge huge amount... ...Now if the PM of the country... ...turns out to be a smart player... Can you blame me for it? I opened my mouth andasked what I wanted. But think... Why would this Pandey give me so much money? Why? I will tell you? Because even the smallest kick back of a large project scam... ...runs into thousands and crores of rupees. ...Poor Hooda... ...He truly wantedto get the bill passed to increase nations security. Instead now Pandey will get the very same bill passed and... ...become country's king... It's a Fantastic Game my friend... The Minute Pandey becomes PM, ...Naveen Shankalya will turn around the Industry policies... ...so that it benifits him and only him... ...Andas for Jay Mallik... while Pandey's men held Dubey on gun point... ...Jay Mallik himself... ...directed Khanna and Dubey on that tape. Where did you findthis CD? Some one sent it... addressedto me And it's our job to put what ever truth that we find in front of everyone... Not for me... Not for yourself... You owe this to the country dad... Clear Ethics just like glass... shatteredto pieces just like glass Clear Ethics just like glass... shatteredto pieces just like glass the faith that twinkled in eyes it's splintersare hurting now. My own hands gave me wounds... I brought myself own to ruins. Clear Ethics just like glass... shatteredto pieces just like glass Pandey... congratulations to you... Thank you sir... Vijay sir... Congratulations Vijay Sir... Many many Congratulations... ...andthank you too... It's only due to you that Mohan Pandey got this opportunity to serve the nation. It's true. I kept on saying that Hooda isa crook... But no one believed me... Even you didn't... Jay foundthe evidence at the right time... By the way, Vijay Sir... ...I have chosen the site of the bomb blast as the venue... ...for my oath taking ceremony, . ...so that the people are assured... ...that during Mohan Pandey's term of office... ...those incidents will never again happen... ...that Hooda government allowed to happen... Today the entire nation is with me... and it's not only mine... but people's wish too... That Vijay Harshvardhan Mallik himself should... ...present Mohan Pandey's oath taking ceremony on his show. Ljust can't believe that you are sayingthis... Mohan Pandey definitely has some charisma...

Just today we spoke about it. Did you hear what I said? You didnt hear what I said. Long live Mohan Pandey... Long live Mohan Pandey... Dad Mohan Pandey has reached for Oath taking... The stage isall set for you to present India's next Prime Minister. Dad... Dad... Long live Mohan Pandey... Long live Mohan Pandey... These are the 2 eyes of India... One is the Hindusand other is the Muslims... If you see with only one eye... You will see an incomplete picture... And if you see with hateful eyes, the vision will be hazy. If we want this country to make great progress... It is necessary that both it's eyesare open. And not only open... It shouldalso be oozing affection and brotherhood. I want to make it clear to all of you that... I am going to create a new identity of this glorious country. It won't be create with tools of corruption... It will be carved with tools of Truth and solid intentions. 5... 4... 3... 2... 1 Sir, we are on air. Sir, we are on air. I have always believedthat... ...the face which you see on television is of 'Trust'... ...is of Truth... But today I am sitting in front of you to admit something... On 21st November I hadtold you all... ...a very dirty lie. Alie, which caused Digvijay Hooda's Government Dismissal. All I can do now is... show you all a few pictures. In these pictures you will see... ...the real Truth of my lie. This person is the same Khanna that I repeatedly kept asking... ..."Who is Khanna? ...Where is khanna?" And now watch the same Khanna. What happened darling, Why are you sittingall alone by yourself? KHANNA... Khanna was neither Dubey's man... ...neither Digvijay Hooda's. Khanna was my own son... Jay Mallik's oldfriend... These pictures were shot... ...when Khanna and my son Jay were studying together in America Our Channel, India 24/7... ...kept asking again andagain, "Where is Khanna?" ...Who is Khanna? While all along Khanna was actually my Son's oldfriend... He was my own Son's oldfriend. Now watch few other facesand other faces of this conspiracy. What do we gain by exposing Pandey? Few days of great TRPs... yes our channel will once again become number one. ...But... 500 crores of Rupees... I opened my mouth and asked what I wanted. But think about it... ...Why would Pandey Give me so much money? ...Why? ...because even the smallest kick back of a large project scam... ...runs into thousands and crores of rupees... Nandita... ...Now if the PM of the country... ...turns out to be a smart player... ...just think how much he will make in the 5 year test match. - Nandita come soon... I, Mohan Pandey, swear on God almighty... That I will honor... That I will honor... the constitution of India... One minute please... Mohan Pandey wantedto become the Prime Minister of this country... Naveen Shankalya wanted to become... ...this country's biggest Industrialist. Amrish Khakkar was just taking an advantage of the opportunity And Jay Mallik... Jay Mallik wantedthat... India 24/7 to become this country's number one News Channel. This is the story of these selfish characters of this plot. If you are watching me right now... ...understand clearly that... ...you have betrayed only me and not the country... It is me who has betrayed our country. In this entire conspiracy if someone is guilty... it is me. It is me... Me. All this became possible only because of one medium. Because of misuse of one medium. That medium is called India 24/7. My own channel. India 24/7. What Jay did wasan extremely codemnable act. He did it knowingly and I did it unknowingly. But was the reason for it? First there is the Government... Then come the Industrialists who produces wealth for the nation. ...andthen the politicians. Some from Ruling party and some from opposition. It is their basic duty towards the common man of this country... to maintain a stable and well defined system. So that everyone can progress without any fear or hindrance. But how well are these responsible people fulfilling their duties? How will the common man come to know... whether these people are fulfilling them or not? For precisely this very purpose, Media was born. But when the Government andthe media... ...in the race to achieve power strike a deal amongst themselves... Newsare no longer reported... but created. Then whom shouldthe public place their trust on? On the News channels? Who instead of reporting newsare dishing out stories of snatching power? Where Instead of reporting serious facts... ...sensationalism is being sold for the sake of TRP? In a Democratic Nation... ...everyone has the right to look after their interest. But we the Media people... ...have given up our right to be unbiased voice of truth... Why? Why have we changed our role? Who will report... which news... in what manner... and be the first... All the newspapersand News Channels are competing with each other in this race This race is not about just surviving in the News market. But a race to prove themselves to be faster than others... ...remain ahead of others... This has morphed into a Race, whose aim is Success v/s Money. To remain ahead in this race one requires... ...more and more viewers... high TRP... ...which translates into high Advertising revenue. More money... Here their true objective should have been 'News'... ...and medium should have been money. Instead of that now Money has become the objective... ...andthe news merely the medium... By punishing me... my son... andthe other characters of this conspiracy... ...will merely finish one chapter, not the problem. Till we do not keep a noble organization like media... ...away from Power, Greedand Money... Many moreJays will keep coming into existance. Since it is we who create systems... It is we who possess the strength to change the prevailing conditions. For past 30 years I have been fighting this battle. ...but haven't been able to win it. I couldn't win. But Purab... I want to remind you... That it is you... ...who has shaken up the entire nation... ...have stopped one wrong step from prevailing. You understandthis firmly that you have not lost. You are victorious. ...and the victory that you have achievedtoday... It is your duty to uphold it. ...your duty... From India 24/7... ...with sincere apologies and deep regret for all...
