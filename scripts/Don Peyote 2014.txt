He was an unemployed, marginally successful graphic novelist... who smoked marijuana often, and had lots of time on his hands. Warren had few ambitions, no radical passions, and he was not political. He was not poor, nor was he rich. He was rarely actually ever sick, and had no trouble sleeping. In fact, the only thing remarkable in Warren's day-to-day existence... was his dreams. Oh, honey. Yeah. Ooh. Oh. Ah. This is Karen, Warren's fiance. Though they had been engaged for over three years, it was only last week that Warren finally succumbed to a date for the ceremony. However, their wedding... was not the only thing on her agenda. Karen was 32 years old, and her biological alarm... was blaring like a foghorn. - Nice one, honey. - This morning, she was ovulating. Jesus Christ. In preparation for their new life, Karen had begun leaving notes for Warren. Post-It notes, strategically placed to intercept Warren's focus... as it drifted from one fascination to another. Warren's life was simple in the summer of 2012. In the mornings, after Karen would leave for work, he would smoke pot and spend about three hours... watching conspiracy theory videos online. I want to ask you a question about the headlines. Does it seem like they're going from grim to grimmer these days? And does it make you wonder... if the prophecies and predictions about 2012 are really coming to pass? The people who tend to suffer the worst during a cataclysmic event... are the ones who simply do not see it coming. He'd spend his days looking for purpose in his life. At night, he and Karen would make dinner, and he would lie to her about his job search. I'm so proud of you. - I'm proud of me, too. - Are you? Mm-hmm. Really? Warren would have continued his routine indefinitely, but for one particularly wet evening. As he was en route to an engagement, something happened. Something phenomenal. Ow! Oh! Fuckin' bum! Whether Warren actually became infected by some next-gen virus... upon co-mingling with the doomsday man, he could not be sure. I bumped into this 2012 end-is-near guy. It was a sign. I just want to go home. Just go home. Stay for a half hour. Find Balance. We're gonna find Balance. We'll find Balance. This is my art, by the way. Hi. Welcome to Whip. No, man. You just can't... You can't sweat too much. You know, they say sex is a Texas drought, but... - See now, man, it's circular... - Anyone know Balance? Oh, yeah. Balance is my boy, man. - Hey, man. - How you doing, brother? What's your name? I'm Warren. How you doing? Balance just left, man. Your boy just went out to get something. He'll be right back. Everything, you know? Viruses, computers. It's all... It's all just coming to some end point, it seems like. It seems like the end is near, to me. I mean, Armageddon, whatever you want to call it. I had a bad bump-into this, like... A homeless guy. He's all sweaty and crazy. He's got this "end is near" sign. He sweat all over me. It was nasty and, and um... Okay. Okay. - Tell him about Planet X. Tell him about... - Planet X. 2012. The end of the world. Daniel Pinchbeck has already written a best-selling book. The movie's already in the can. Well, is this stuff laced? With barbarian kangaroo. Aw. Barbarian kangaroo. Quarter of a pomegranate might do you in. Look at him on a quarter of a pomegranate. 'Cause we injected it with that acid. That wolfbane. You had enough. He's spinning like a top. - There are different principles. - Yeah. So, I felt that being given this media stage and spotlight... by Hollywood was... was, like, you know, necessary to take that... that option and opportunity, but then, you know, what I felt was that... Karen? Honey? Karen? Karen? Warren, it's not Karen. It's not the fuckin' I.R.S. I am your worst nightmare, Warren. Oh, sh... Um... I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This is my bad. This is my bad. Come on! Hey. Oh, my God. I can't... Am I paralyzed? I need you to listen to me. All right? I'm tired of games. All right? I... I want the truth. You really want the truth? Mm-hmm. You really wanna know? She was an agent of truth. A general of light. She was ex-everything. Ultra black ops. Warren sat paralyzed for what seemed like weeks, frozen, listening to her. The floodgates opened, and she told him every secret. Einstein was an alias. The whole truth about J.F.K., 9-11, Area 51, the Illuminati, the moon landings, Jesus and Magdalene, the C.I.A., K.G.B. and AIDS, the reptilian elite, Watergate, the New World Order, Bilderberg, the MK-ULTRA Project, the Federal Reserve System, false flag operations, Paul McCartney, coup d'tats, Tesla and the suppression of vortex technologies, global surveillance, espionage, and the secret underground intelligence agency cities, FEMA, mind control, media control... and the subliminal propaganda agency, NASA, the N.S.A., the Loch Ness monster, drug wars, synthetic disease, the cure for cancer, the criminalization of marijuana, water fluoridation and peak oil. She described in vivid detail the history of the world... and the oppression of the human consciousness. She held nothing back and gave him the truth about God, the devil, heaven, hell and the delicate fabric of the universe. Her cigarette never burned out. Well, she would have left right then and there, but she realized Warren was a simple man, and for fear he would retain none of this ancient, secret knowledge, she had no choice but to do one last thing. In happier news now. Anne Hathaway. - She's planning her big day. - She is. What do we hear about her wedding plans? Sources are saying that she just sent out save-the-dates... for a wedding in New York at the Plaza... with her fianc Adam Shulman. She's very, very happy, and we're happy for her. Such a huge star in Hollywood. Yeah. A really great example. You don't hear about her dancing on tables... or some ridiculous scandal. She is a class act. She is a class act. She is one of the starlets that really rises to the occasion. She is. When you watch her on screen, you care about her character. There are so many times I report on movie stars, and I'm really just talking about so-and-so just playing a part, but I'm really looking at the star. - Welcome to Bridal Reflections. - Thank you. I'm Tony. Warren. Warren. I... I'm Karen. Karen. Well, nice to... Nice to have you here. Follow me right in through here. To the left, we have our bridal gowns. Gorgeous. We'll do bridesmaids first, though. Then focus on that? Yeah. That'll be fine. So, are you nervous about the big day? What big day? Your wedding. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yes, I am. Let's take a look at some dresses over here. Well, make yourself comfortable. Okay. Oh, it's so cute. Honey? What do you think? It's gorgeous. - It'll look great. - You like it? I like it. Well, this fabric is... You okay? Yeah. Babe? I was thinking maybe we should have doves, or something. I'm gonna make a phone call. - Okay, Warrey. - He sounds excited. Nah. No, he is. So, definitely you can do... Don't get this. I don't like it. Honey, that's a bridal gown. Okay. Hello? Yo, Warrey, my big fuzzy bear. Hi. Where the hell were you last night? Ate a bunch of peyote. Stayed inside and pretty much contemplated my universe... through the holes in my socks. The usge. His name was Balance. He was Warren's childhood friend, his confidante, his wing man. He was never there when you wanted him to be, but always there when you needed him to be. Listen, I need your camera, okay? - What do you need my camera for? - I don't wanna talk about it. We always talk about stuff and we never do shit. I wanna do this. Okay. All right. But if you're... shooting something, you should at least let me know what it is. I can't be associated with, you know, shooting some kind of, uh, granny porn, or some sort of... - Like, a robot android sex film. - No, no. Jesus, man. I just wanna make a film. I wanna make maybe a documentary, maybe. - A documentary? All right. Cool. - I think I wanna do this... - like, a 2012 thing, you know? - Like... Something about what's really going on in the world. Also, I need a little bit more, uh, of that weed because... I'm starting to freak out a little bit over here. All right, my brother. Give me a heads-up when you get over here, okay? Honey? Yes, dear? What do you think of bougainvillea? I'm stoked for this interview. I don't really know him that well. They made a good team, after all. Ever since they were kids, Balance looked to Warren to supply the missions, and Warren looked to Balance to keep them on task. You do the psychological, intellectual-type thing, and I will just capture the man's essence, you know what I mean? Not his essence exactly. His aura. His persona. As long as you just don't talk. Can you do me a favor? Come here. Trying to set a mood here. Oh, man. And they're gonna be... And they're gonna be here in, like, any second. Okay. And I... I don't want you to be here, although... Hi. How you doing? Somehow, Warren had scored his first major interview. - Who are you doing this for, man? - I... I've never had, you know, a real focus, you know? A real, um, in my life, and, uh... Daniel Pinchbeck was a best-selling author... and one of the leading authorities... on Mayan and Hopi prophecies for 2012. I couldn't stop thinking about it once I... once I hit that guy. Well, what do you know about 2012? Well, I know... I know the vagueness of it. You know, just a layman's, uh, you know, perspective from it. I'm not, like, a fundamentalist about the date. I think that we're... You know, it's obvious that we're in, like, a major transformational period... for humanity on the earth, but it's clear that if we don't change our behavior... on a species level, really, uh, you know, we're gonna hit, like, a major disruption. My whole thing is that we... have a really short period of time... to, um, become conscious of the situation that we're in. You guys are professionals here. Look at this. I can't believe this. ...our social systems. This is, like, we're the real thing. This is great. You line 'em up. Who's the next one? Line 'em up. I'm ready to go. I want as many people as we can talk to as possible. And we're really gonna... We're gonna make a full movie. I mean, I feel it. I don't care what she says. She wants something to say at the wedding? "What is Warren doing? Uh, is Warren sitting on his ass?" "No. He's making a documentary that's gonna save the fuckin' world." You dig it. Do you have a lighter? We're gonna make magic here, brother. Is that your guy? Bates. You should interview him. You want me to interview... You want me to interview your weed dealer? Yeah, dude. He's totally dialed in, man. He knows about conspiracy theory and shit like that. All types of shit. Bates, you wanna be in a movie? It's not porn. Shh! How you doing? Bates. Sure, he was a drug dealer, but that was just his cover. - What's your name? - He was part philosopher, part businessman, part outlaw. I'm trying to get prepared for the end of the world. - You know? Uh... - Aren't we all? - What do you mean? - I'm... I'm with you, man. I've been fuckin' stockpiling shit for the past two years. Well, I've been planning on stockpiling shit for the past two years. Like what? The single greatest threat that humankind faces... It's not global warming. It's not aliens. It's not even natural disaster, in my opinion. C.W.P. What is that, man? Consolidation of wealth and power. Are you familiar... with the military concept of full-spectrum dominance? What? That sounds... I don't know. I'm not... On land, sea, air, space, in the mind, weather. Yeah. - Weather? - Weather. - You're buggin' me out, man. - The High Altitude Auroral Radio Project. A rich oilman in Houston, Texas. Who does he have more in common with? The average Texan, or a wealthy Arab guy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia? Made his money off oil, okay? It's not Christian against Muslim. It's not left against right. It's rich against poor. Behind closed doors, there's no such thing as Republican or Democrat... or Christian or Muslim or Jew, or any of it. Behind closed doors, there's rich people and the rest of us. It's falling apart. It's all falling apart. That's the whole point. This is what I'm saying. This joint is us. This joint... This joint is it. Whether you call it 2012. Whether you call it global warming. When it fuckin' happens, it's all falling apart. This is a very exciting time for you both. Father Angelo and I are thrilled to be able to co-officiate your wedding ceremony. - Yeah. Thank you so much for having us. - You're so welcome. Well, Karen and Warren, I know that you voiced some concerns about interfaith marriage... and how that might affect your raising your children and holidays and in-laws... Warren, what the fuck, dude? Why am I getting a voice mail right now? Shit is on. It's happening. I'm on the front line right now down here in Occupy Wall Street. And there's, like, free sandwiches, and stuff. It's awesome. Are we, in the words of Jimmy Cliff, gonna save our planet Earth. Or are we, in the words of Jim Morrison, who's gonna get our nut before the whole shithouse comes down? I do need you to bring me a battery for the camera... because I forgot the battery. I thought, as I said on the phone, that it would be great... to start talking about these things before your wedding, and really start sort of distilling for both of you... what's important, and what you feel might be negotiable. Actually, you know, Warren, I don't recall... that we've ever discussed your relationship... to Judaism, and where you stand, theologically speaking. I was... I was raised Jewish. I, uh... had a bar mitzvah. Um... I had a bris. We don't need any proof. We believe you. Okay. So, would you say that you consider yourself today... a practicing Jew? I don't know what I am. Uh, at the moment, I think I'm leaning toward... fuckin' Buddhism. Well, then today is a great opportunity... for all of us together to talk about... what you both believe in your hearts to be important. Well, uh... You know, things are weird out there. They're really kind of scary out there. Crazy weather. That was crazy. That, and the impending global... massive change that's going to happen... at the latter end of 2012. That has me, um, uh, kind of preoccupied. That and, you know, there's certain shadow governments... that are making very bold maneuvers with our air space. Yikes, honey. It is... It is exciting, but maybe, you know, for another time, babe. It's happening now, honey. It's not just the film. It's happening with me. Now. This anxiety. This is all happening right fuckin' now, and I'm trying to tell you this, and you don't seem to want to listen to me. I've been trying to tell you for several weeks what's going on. No. I do want to listen. But right now... Actually, right now... Right now, we are sitting with these two lovely people that were nice enough... Honey, what the fuck was that? Whoa. Listen, I'm not gonna sit there... - I'm not gonna lie to those people. - You don't want to get married. - What are you talking about? - Bullshit, okay? This is about... I want to survive. This is about your fear of commitment again. No. I don't know what you're talking about. You're being crazy. I'm not saying you're doing it consciously, but unconsciously, you're sabotaging our life together. I feel it. I feel it every day. You walk out the door. You just... You just need to listen to me, okay? Warren... Look at me, please. You need to listen to me once in a while. I don't want to hear another word about it. I don't want to hear another word about chemtrails... or, uh, Bilderberg or fucking, uh, torsion folds... Torsion Fields. Warren, I am serious, okay? I need you to take this wedding seriously. Otherwise, just forget about it. Okay. What do you want me to do? I just want you to be there. Okay? Okay. I will. I will be. Okay. Okay. It's all good. It's all good. Okay. Oh, God. As he spiraled deeper... into the rabbit hole on his quest for truth, Warren felt less and less himself. Ten thousand years of Chinese medicine. There's always the possibility... that what's going on is from the neck up. Your blood pressure is elevated. He visited every doctor in his reach... Western, Eastern, philosophical, mental, holistic... nothing. His cholesterol and his blood pressure were high, but no specific illness revealed itself. For all intents and purposes, he was a reasonably healthy person. Or perhaps he was cursed. Come with me, Don Peyote. Warren had opened a wormhole. His desire for knowledge was insatiable, and now, Warren seemed to be living two lives. On one hand, he was still Warren, the soon-to-be-married and out-of-work graphic novelist. On the other hand, he was Warren the filmmaker, documentarian and mythologist. The truth seeker and messenger from the gods. Turn up the volume of consciousness... to become more complete. Fear permeates the entire culture. - There's a lot of fear in this. - It's a form of mind control. When you talk about destruction of the world... by flood, that becomes very real... when you consider the melting of the ice caps. What geneticists are saying... is that we're actually evolving to another species. Differentiation in our gene expression... has accumulated so much to the point where some people... can't even be classified as Homo sapien. One term is "Homo sanctus," which means spirit man. These electrolyte salts... facilitate voltage-gated ion channels in the body. What's that? That's the Twin Towers? Yeah. Definitely looks like a tidal wave. Is it a tidal wave coming over the city? Yeah. And the whole city looks like it's being destroyed. I wanted to get the highest quality everything... because I know you want to get this done quickly. What's the real price of burning fossil fuel? This'll be the latest end-of-the-world scenario going on, Comet Elenin. Chaos, anarchy, potential for global wars. So, we got media reading our minds, feeding it into us, programming us. There's three ways we can do it. Quickly and cheaply... Our infrastructure will be destroyed. There won't be electricity. - There won't be water. - You could get it done with money. And fast. Or we could get it done... - No. We can't... That's not... - 2012 is a constellational movement. With money, but not fast. It would take longer. Are you done? It's way, way fuckin' deep. Way over everybody's head. The true prophecy of 2012... is something that we will, in fact, bring upon ourselves. As you can see, we will have weather changes. We will have new mutated disease which will not be diagnosable, And it is usually sign of... What do you think about that whole "Homo sanctus" thing? - Yeah. - You believe it? Yeah. Don't you? We need somebody. They're like the Jedis, right? Did you have your wisdom teeth taken out? Uh, yeah. You're not Homo sanctus. But if you have wisdom teeth, then you are Homo sanctus? If you don't have wisdom teeth, then you are Homo sanctus. This guy believes... Weren't you listening? He believes that worst comes to worst... that you could eat anything... plastic, glass, you know, garbage. He could... He could just... He's actually grown... and adapted to the pollution, so it actually works for him. You dig what I'm saying? We're lower on the food chain. This guy would eat you and me. Well, maybe you. Are you Homo sanctus? Are you Homo sanctus? Are you Homo sanctus? Homo sanctus checklist. No wisdom teeth. Check. Open mind. Curiosity. Check. Yeah. You are a spirit warrior. Oh. Homo sanctus. Hi. How you doing? I'm okay. How you doing? Oh, man. I'm okay. I was just playing around. Yeah? What are you doing? Um... Just getting in touch... You got into Mommy's lipstick. I got into Mommy's lipstick. Why? Uh... Why? Oh, man. Can I use that towel? Yeah. Sure. Um... Just daydreaming again. Next thing I knew, I... I was in Cats. Yeah. "Now and Forever." "Now and Forever." Sorry, baby. I messed up your lipstick. No, no. It's okay. Shit. It's okay. I can get another lipstick. Do you have any idea what happened to our honeymoon savings account? Uh... What do you mean? I mean that all the money, you know, that I had been working really hard to put in that account is gone. Well, how much... How much? Like, $3,000. Um... Did you spend it? I've just been having, like, health issues, you know, recently. - What kind of health issues? - I didn't want to worry you. - And, you know, I just... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What kind of health issues? You know, it's like, uh... I would get anxiety, and, uh, and, uh... Why didn't you talk to me about this? I didn't want to get you worried. Don't you think... that I'd be more worried if I just, "A," heard that all our money was gone, and "B," you have these mental issues and you're not talking about them? - Yeah. That is weird. - Yeah. It's weird, War. I mean, what's going on? Yeah. I don't know. I've just been... I just been out of my head. I've just been making bad decisions, you know? Do you think maybe you should talk to somebody? Like, go back to Dr. Fieldman? Just as a favor. And if... If Dr. Fieldman says that I'm crazy, will you still marry me? Of course, Warren. So, what's been going on at home... that's got Karen insisting that you come back to me for therapy? Well, off the record, I mean, she's very, very stressed out right now. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. And... But she seems to think... you're behaving rather strangely. Why would she think that? Oh. I'm having these... incredibly... vivid dreams, you know? And, uh... Oh. And other... Images. And, um... I'm working on this project now... that I think is very, very important. I feel like, I don't know, it may change the world. And I feel like I am... I've got this greater purpose, or something, in my life, and my brain... It's just... It won't shut off. I... It's just working overtime... trying to crack this code. It just feels like the... You feel, like, that... that we're living... in some... some really, like, fucked-up times right now. You would agree with that, right? That's how you see it? Yes. And... I mean, someone's gotta come along. I mean... And just... You know? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Uh... What am I gonna do? I mean, I got to raise a family in this? So, uh, it's the, uh, delusions of grandeur again, right? Fuck. No, Doc. Look, um, you're making me a bit nervous. I, uh, think you should just come back. Sit down. Have a cookie. Nah. I'm done with your cookies, Doc. No offense. I'm done with you, too. What? Warren. Warren? No. Okay. - Warren, ready for... - Shut up, shut up, shut up. I'm blown today, bro. Movies. Get a cab. Get a cab. Grab a cab, because, uh... You see Karen anywhere? No. Why? Is... He didn't want to be pacified. If the end of the world was coming, he wanted to be prepared. He wanted to survive, and he was gonna find out how. Because I've... Look, I've been conditioned all my life... to deal with this kind of death and destruction. So, unless you're willing to deal with death on a massive scale, you really, really, honest to God don't wanna see that. So, Warren, the nice engaged man, lives in a Chelsea doorman building, wants to buy a gun. Change your dagger. Make it go all the way around the clock. Like that. Yeah. Arm direct my body. That way, it makes you pull it like that. Then you're just gonna walk behind me and slice my throat. You're living in a system that's walking on a tightrope. You know? What are people going to do? - You ever held a gun before? - Not a real one. - It's some Dirty Harry shit. - Yeah. When you're here and you're holding, you're cutting out. The reason why you're standing... If you had to choose the way that you died, would being shot... Quick and painless. Quick and painless. Wow. Right. So, think of things that are not as quick and not as painless... And those are the things that you can say that would discourage people... even more than a firearm. You ever talk to anyone professionally? A shrink? Somebody? - Yeah. I got a therapist. Yeah. - You do? You need to talk about this, because you can't come in here... wishy-washy about buying a gun. Come on, Warren. You really want to keep a .44 Magnum under your pillow? Direct your mental projection... and make it into reality, which is magic. You've made your projects become real. And so, coming in your future, you are the magus. The magician. And you're gonna change the world. So, just allow it to be. But don't bring this "Oh, my God. "What if they're gonna blow up our whole mentality?" home. Because your partner will not feel safe, and then... As Warren lay there in his bed beside Karen, he realized he was completely exhausted. He had amassed more information about the end of the world than he could register. But the puzzle was still incomplete, and as his fiance lay beside him sleeping, he realized that she was the only thing left in his life... that did make sense. He decided he was gonna do something for her. Pick up the dry cleaning, maybe. Buy her flowers. Take her out to dinner. He would reconnect with her. Or so he thought. Hello. What the fuck? Hello, everybody. Honey? Excuse me. What the fuck is going on? Excuse me. What are you doing? What are you doing? More. L'Roi. Oh, no. This is my shit. What the fuck is going on in there? Your fiance, um, invited us up, me and my friends, for the party. My fiance invited you for... What is going on in there? I don't know who's in there. What the fuck is going on here? What the fuck is going on here? It's a bachelorette party. You're fuckin'... Excuse me. Excuse me. What's going on here. Harder. Harder. Here, come on. Honey, what are you doing here? I thought you were at work. You didn't want to fuck her anyway. Shove a hot pepperoni up her cupcake. You fuck off, man! Fucks like a dog. It squirts Crisco like a greasy hog. It's really fuckin' funny! Really fucking funny! What the... Oh... Put the gun away, Warren. Jesus Christ. Just calm down. I fuckin' got a gun. Holy fuck. I got a gun. I got a gun! What are you doing? Warrey? Why'd you fuckin' do this to me? How could you do this to us? I thought you were working, honey. I didn't know you were gonna come home so soon. - What did you say? - You told me to seize the day, Warren. You said to start doing things that I wanted to do. Live life, you know, 'cause the world was gonna end. So, that's what I'm doing. Don't fuckin' laugh! How could you fuckin' do this to us? It's our life together. You do this, you think this is fuckin' funny? Fuckin' on our bedsheets? Fuck you. Warren! Honey? Honey? Hey, sweetie, did you get the dry cleaning? What's going on? You okay? Sweetie? Honey, are you okay? Warren? Wait a minute. I'm not crazy. Am I crazy? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Sweetie? Warren? Honey? Oh, my... Warren? Honey? Can you hold these for me? I... All right. Honey? Oh, my God. War? Honey, wake up. Food for thought for thoughtful fools. I tell you what. I tell you what. First one to the eternal beyond is a rotten egg. The last one has to eat it. Oh, yeah I woke up today In a pool of my own blue vomit, yeah I took the last flight on the back of a carpet Yeah Don't ask me my name Faces looking strange Life is just a game, and I don't give a damn Yeah 'Cause I'm a little bit drunk and I don't know where I am Hell 'Cause I'm a little bit drunk and I don't know where I am Excuse me. Excuse me, miss. Can you tell me where I am? I said excuse me. Stronger than death Hyah! Ha. - Hyah. - All right. This is the part of the trip I dig the most. No, no, wait. This is the part of the trip. It's when I flop around like I'm on peyote and... When I flop around like I'm on peyote. Hyah. Hey. Ho. Ho. Hyah. Ho. Hey. Ho. Ah, baby, it's all right Baby, it's all right Ah, baby, it's all right Baby, it's all right Ah, baby, it's all right Baby, it's all right Ah, baby, it's all right Baby, it's all right Ah, baby, it's all right, baby, it's all right, baby, it's all right In primal cultures, rites of passage... are often painful, humiliating and violent... as the old persona is literally destroyed to make way for the new. Homo sanctus. The ritual initiation is marked... by the liminal state. The time in between. He's the one. Hey. What did you say? Ah, shit. Hey. Hey. Hey, wait up. Hey. Frickin' freezing, man. He's frickin'... Hey. Hey, what... Oh, my God. He was between an identity that was given to him... by custom, convention, law and ceremony, and a new self that awaited on the other side. What did you say, man? Hey, Warren. What are you doing down here? How do you know my name? You shouldn't be here, man. These freaks are all telepaths. Let's not say he was mad. No. Let's just say he was lost somewhere in the middle. In the in-between. He is the one. He bears the mark. He comes. Homo sanctus. Come here. Let me show you something. Get it together, Warren. Whoa! He comes this way. He comes. Did I just say that? All hail Homo sanctus. But first, let's check his teeth. No. Wait. Guys. Hold on. They say he is coming, the broken man. I'd keep out of his way as much as you can. Don't let him touch you, whatever you do, or you might catch what he's got, too. What's wrong with you people? What did I do? Oh, come on. Please. Whoa.

You wanna die of boredom or you wanna die of stress? That's what a citizen has as options. We need, uh, some mad genius to change things. Yeah. You think that might be me? Well, you don't really look the, uh, part. Thanks. Good night, man. Hey. Good night, Warren. Warren had lost everything. Sleep tight, Warren. The year 2012 had come and gone... and yet, his documentary remained incomplete, a shambles of incoherent footage... stranded somewhere on Balance's hard drives. Yet, in a funny way, he was free. He had no obligations and nothing left to lose. The world was his oyster. Listen, Warren. You gotta take me with you. Please. This place is full of nuts. Doc, please. Shut the fuck up. Okay? Okay?

You guys are making me miss my fiance... Why do you say that? ...so goddamn much. Well, I don't know. You guys are good together. They were the most beautiful hoboes Warren had ever seen. I'm torn between wanting to... They owned no property or land. They had no money or even any need for it. I'm torn between wanting to, uh... But you couldn't call them homeless. No. They were just off the grid. It was the first time it had ever occurred to Warren... that money and material possessions... were not a prerequisite for living happily in this world. I don't know, man. I feel like I should follow... What? Your heart? Uh, no. You should follow your heart. It's more like a call to arms. You know? I really wanna try and save the world. You know? Oh, man. Wait. You know... Let's save it tomorrow. It's a little bit too late for that. Took some classes back in New York. No, no. Kickboxing's not gonna help you, dude. Not... Listen to me. Come here. This is all you need. Defense. Offense. Yeah. Defense, offense. Okay. Defense, offense. Oh! You see? That's all you need. No, no. That's all you need. Fighting is not gonna help. I mean, maybe... maybe if you're, like, the first to one. Right there. I was, uh... I was training in New York. Maybe you'll be able to hold down your spot in the grocery store, your favorite aisle, but when the shit really hits the fan... Here drink that. It's so good. It's good for you. When the shit really hits the fan, when the ramen noodles... The gasoline. The gasoline, when they're gone... Then what? Then what are you gonna do? You need a real hardened spirit... to survive on the land. Drink it. Oh. It's tangy. Mm-hmm. Is that apples? Where you... Where you going exactly? Kinda been like birds, flying south for the winter. Migrating south. I've been migrating south all summer. Haven't I? Mazel tov. No. We like you. Can I have more? It's good. Right? Yeah. You ever heard of, uh, the maestro on your travels? The maestro? No. No. Never had any ayahuasca? That's what you're drinkin' right now, man. You're drinking ayahuasca right now. That is amazing he even asked that. It's crazy. That is so fucking crazy. Can you believe he just asked that? What? Yeah. It's good for what ails you. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Am I gonna start tripping my balls off right now? No. Opening up your third eye. Opens up your pineal gland. Yeah. I'm telling you. Maybe it's gotten calcified... from all that fucking fluoride they... keep putting in the water. We like to give it a kick start... every couple of days with this ayahuasca medicine. You know what I mean? It makes us right as rain. Swear to God. It's so good. Bet it'll kick start my pineal gland. Ecstatic spiritual visions to follow shortly. He's cute. I think I would've... liked some warning, um, before doing something like this. We thought you... We thought you might appreciate it. You know? Besides you're part of a... You're part of a small-scale test. What test? He's cool. I'm cool. He's cool. He's cool. You can tell me. We can... Okay. Okay. So we've been thinking, what if we were to accidently spill, say, 100 gallons of ayahuasca medicine into the water supply? The psychedelic effects... on our culture would be enormous. Can you imagine? Half of New York City in the middle of Times Square... having a genuine... a genuine spiritual experience? I mean, dude... Dude. Oh, my God. The ripple effect would be huge. The hundred monkey theory would spread it across the globe like... like that. Across the globe. Dude, it would be the most amazing thing anybody's ever seen. It's the next step in human evolution, dude. It is the next step in human evolution. What are you doing? No, no. We don't eat them. We don't eat dandelions. Ah. He's gone. He's gone. Ah. He's so cute. There you go. Just wrap yourself up in a cocoon. There you go. He looks like a glowworm. The ayahuasca had squeegee'd his third eye quite clean. Every dimension was in his grasp. Come with me, Don Peyote. Come with me. And the goddess rained gifts of forgiveness down on him. Move a muscle and I'll blow... your gizzard clear into the buffet table. He told you not to move. Hi, guys. It wasn't even loaded. Yeah. You know, we all thought that you gave up on your quest. No. Not I. Still fighting the good fight. I did try the ayahuasca though. What a game changer. Who goes there? Who are you? Who are you? Hey. You son of a bitch. Where you been? I don't know, man. You left me in the cab, all alone. I-I didn't mean to. I had to. It's good to see you. It's good to see you. Where you been? What happened to you? The Illuminati happened to me. No. Yeah. They're chasing me. What? Who's following you? They're all chasing me. C.I.A., F.B.I., K.G.B., K.F.C., Mickey D's. I think when you were in the hospital, they planted some kind of, like, tracking device in your brain. Really. Here. Wear this metal hat. Um... It will prevent them from tracking your every move. Yeah. Why? Here. Also take these. I got 500 DVDs of the film in here. It's all up to you. Great job. It's time for me to bounce. No. No. No. You just got here. Don't go. No. Don't go. Remember... brick wall. Waterfall. Don't go. Come on. You just got here. Poof. No. N... No. Jesus H. Christ. What? Oh, no. I had a delicious amount of food piled up... and they took it away from me. Do you gentlemen know where my friends went? Your friends? I don't think you have friends here, ass clown. Why you wearing a garbage can on your head? I think you're a little lost. I think you better get out of here... with that garbage can on your head. I think you fellas may be right. Fuck you. Are you missing a circus there, friend? I am Don Peyote! If you guys can help me out, I'd really appreciate it. Get your fuckin' hands off that. Get it out of your mouth. Spit it out. Spit it out. In my... You fuckin' idiot. I did what you told me to do. I don't like your face. I don't like the way you smell. You smell like shit. Hold on, hold on, hold on. You guys are obviously upset. And I'd... I'd like to share with you my DVD. I don't want to see your DVDs. I want to see you fuckin' leave. We are friends here. Hey. Hey. Well, hit him. Hit him in the face, Ellwood. Should I hit him? Fuck all, Ellwood. You may hit me, but I warn you, this is gonna hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. Are you calling me stupid? Warren took the beating. He did not fight back. And in doing so, he became aware that the cycle had ended, the cycle of violence, confusion and self-hatred. And in this moment, as he reached rock-bottom with nothing left to lose, he realized he had everything to give. And the goddesses danced in his heart. Warren looked in the mirror... and realized that his fear was gone. His doubt was gone. His longing was gone. Indeed, Warren was gone. And all that was left was me. Don Peyote. The cosmic drum has been rung. Time is a wave and the wave is vibrating. Faster and faster. For some of us, it will be stranger and scarier... than anything we've ever seen before. And for others, it will be the coolest thing... that ever happened in the history of humankind. I would make a sign. A sign of enduring peace. The past is the future is the past And I would walk the earth and carry a message. A message of unity will take hold... and grow in every living mind and never die. And this symbol of peace will spread throughout the world. Whoa New York, L.A., Paris, Africa, Egypt, Israel, Spain, Nebraska. It became part of the collective unconscious overnight. He performed several miracles. Whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa Unfortunately, upon performing his last one, the whole idea of it made him sick. He disappeared for seven years. That place looks great. They finished it. Finally. Grady. Honey, sit down and eat. Okay? It's gonna get cold. What's he doing? He's playing with those flowers. He's always just playing with the flowers. He's completely disconnected. I think we should have him see Dr. Gregory. You're in denial. I'm not in denial. As usual. I'm just saying he needs... he needs something. He needs... He needs help. He doesn't need any help. Just to see. Just to explore what the options are. Just think about it. Medication is a possibility. He's completely in his own bubble. He doesn't need medication. He's fine, honey. He's playing. He's fine. He's always playing. He's an imaginative kid. Okay? I know what I'm talking about. I'm not saying you don't know what you're talking about. He seems to be going in a very strange direction. He is a little boy. I understand he's a little boy. Okay. Someday he's going to be a grown man... and I think we both know what his genes are. He's creative. Okay. He's fun. He's fine. I could be so happy If I just quit being sad I could be so funny If I just quit being a drag I could be so sweet If I just quit being sour I could do all these things Oh, I have the power I'm gonna see what tomorrow brings I'm gonna make it to the midnight train I'm gonna see what tomorrow brings I'm gonna take it to the world outside Whoo Put your hands together. So I took off running I ran And the good vibe spread across the land... and the name Don Peyote became synonymous with peace and joy. The hundredth monkey had finally turned the tide... just in the nick of time. And it was truly an awesome sight to behold. I don't wanna stand still I am going out into I'm going out to the sweet unknown I am going out into I'm going out to the sweet unknown Oh, I'm longing to be Oh, I'm longing to be, oh, out in the sweet unknown Oh, I'm longing to be Oh, I'm longing to be, oh, out in the sweet unknown Out in the sweet unknown. Out in the sweet unknown Out in the sweet unknown I had a script come across this desk two days ago. A reboot of the Battleship franchise. Great role for Dan. He didn't even want to talk about it. "I want to do another indie film." Look what I got here. It's him and a penguin kinda going... on a cross-country tr... You know, you got Dan in a car on a cross-country trip. It reads a lot funnier than I'm saying it, but it's a very funny role, so right for Dan. Just gotta stop doing this indie shit. Oh, Danny boy. The pipes are calling. Just kidding. It's me. I just saw the movie. I loved it!
