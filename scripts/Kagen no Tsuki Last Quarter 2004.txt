You'd better call your mom. She'll be worried. She doesn't care about me. There's no room for me there. Don't be like that. It's about time you got over it. By the way, you shouldn't drive back to Kamakura tonight. I'll be all right. I'll stay at Shige's again. I'm sorry. Dad remarried just like that. Made me move away to Yokohama, too. But it didn't stop me. Even got into school nearby. I hear you. What I meant was... What? Kiss? - No. - Why? They can all see. So? Thanks for coming. Take care of Tomoki. Right. You too. See you. Bye. Take care. Mizuki. Aya, had a bit too much? Are you all right? I'm fine. You don't look fine. Wanna see something? Here. Mizuki, wait! Hey, Mizuki! I tried so hard today. What did I do wrong? What's most important to me is gone. What do you mean? The man who loves only me! Hey. Hold on! Ow... That tune... I'm sorry for intruding. I know the melody. Because I wrote it for you. That's impossible. I've known it since I was very little. I started the piano because I wanted to play this melody. I could never play it to the end, though. I've never met anyone else who knows it. This is the first time... I've met someone who knows it. It's not the first time. What? We met before? How odd. It doesn't feel like it's my first time being here. I've seen a house like this in my dreams. But in my dreams it was always locked and I couldn't get in. Do you live alone? I'm renting it for a week. Where are you from? London. London? That's far away. Mizuki! We got you a cake yesterday and we were waiting. Are you going somewhere? Going on a trip with your friends? Mizuki... Hey, Cinderella! Here's your shoe. Hey, are you going somewhere? You're carrying a lot. I don't know what Aya told you, but... She's serious about you. You must've known how she felt for a long time! I'm sorry. But you're most important to me. You let her on the bike, didn't you? You must've forgotten your promise. I haven't forgotten. Then why? If you break your promise... Remember that? Hey! Come on! Piece of crap! Damn! Key! So it wasn't a dream. Mom... Mom! Mom, what's wrong? Mom. Mom! What's the matter? Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! Please don't leave me! I thought you'd left. I feel out of place at home. Am I disturbing you? I'm relieved. My father remarried a year ago. Now he has a new wife and her kid. But she's actually his daughter. He was having an affair while my mom was still alive. They're trying hard to hide it from me. But it's so obvious. That's why my mom... And my half-sister is afraid that I may get more attention from her mom. So she's always mean to me. Her mother tries to be nice, but it just makes things worse. I'm saving up to move out. Sorry. I don't know why I'm telling you all this. Thanks... for coming back. Maybe we have met before. I never tell such things to strangers. Well, come to think of it, I don't know your name. Adam. Adam? - I am... - Mizuki. How? My boyfriend. Ex, actually. We broke up yesterday. He's flirtatious and loose with girls. Every time I saw him apologize profusely... I couldn't stay mad at him. So I just sucked it up and forgave him. Because I still loved him. But not this time. I've had enough! He slept with my best friend. You should go ahead and cry at a time like that. Ta-dah! See this! My beloved bike, Paul! We'll go lots of places! What's that? I won't forgive you if you get in an accident. I know. I promise I won't. Easy for you to say. I really mean it. And I promise... that no girl but you will ride the back. That's such a worn-out promise. But I bet you anything you can't keep it. If I break it, I'll do anything you tell me to. But I'm confident I won't break it. But if you break it, Tomoki... I will... The user you're trying to reach is currently unavailable. Welcome back. Where've you been? Your hands are cold. Are you sick? You could die like this! It's your fault. You died... and now... I... Don't go! Please don't go anywhere. I can't live... without you. I just can't. I won't go anywhere. I'll stay by you forever. Hello, Mizuki, where are you? Aya told me you haven't been at school. Call me when you get this message. Or your dad, if you prefer not to talk to me. Mizuki... It's me, Aya. I'll call again. Hey, it's me, Tomoki. Where did you go? Call me so I can apologize. I'll be waiting. Hello. Mizuki... Adam! Where are you? I must go now. I'm glad we met. Wait! You said we'd always be together! I would have to take you with me. Take me with you, then! I'll go anywhere! If we see each other before the moon disappears, we'll go. I'll be at the junction by the museum. I'm so sorry. Mizuki, wait! Mizuki! Mizuki... Hey, look! Hey, Tomoki! Tomoki! Look over there. That's her. - What? - Over there! Mizuki! What's she doing this late? And with a big bag like that? That's what I want to know! No. Mizuki! Mizuki! Sybelle! Sybelle! Sybelle! What's wrong? I'm looking for my cat. Over there. Thank you. Adam! Hotaru, we need to get going. Never do something reckless like that, looking for the cat so late at night. I thought it was a joke when I heard you had been hit by a car. Mom? Did you find Sybelle? Not yet. But I'll keep looking. Heat up dinner as usual at home. I have to go to work right away. I know. Hello. Tomoki? You're not coming again? Jamming might help for a change. Are you there? Sorry. But I'm not in the mood. Not yet at least. Happy 18th Birthday, Mizuki! Thank you. From me... you get this! Here you go. It's a train-shaped piggy bank! You're so cheap, old miser! This too, then. Even worse. You'll sell me this at cost, won't you? Look who's talking. Bargaining in front of your girlfriend. You're so childish. Don't you agree, Mizuki? No, because that's his charm! Mizuki! Sweet honey! Cherry pie! Come on! Do it outside! You can pay later! Thank you as always. Thanks. MISSING Shiraishi? Sybelle? Sybelle! Sybelle! Sybelle? Sybelle... Sybelle... Sybelle... Isn't this... that song? Sybelle! Who's there? Pardon me. I came in without permission. I know you! You don't remember me? You were looking for your cat in the fenced woods. I thought it was a dream... I'm happy to see you again. I was lonely. You're all alone in a place like this? No. You've been with me, Adam. So you're Adam? I see. Your cat ran away again? You must be worried. That night... I heard my mom call out "Hotaru" many times. Then I woke up in the hospital. Your name is Hotaru? Yes. And yours? Mine? I don't remember. What? Not just my name. Anything. Next thing I knew I was in here... and now I can't leave even if I try. Is it because the gate is locked? Locked? Who did it? Adam won't be able to get in then! Adam? Hotaru... See? Every time I try to get out, I'm put back here. I had a boyfriend. Adam. All I remember is the week I lived here with him. Am I cursed to stay here forever... locked in with no recollection? Forever. Thank you. Shiraishi? Miura? Why are you here? What are you doing in a place like this, skipping school? Is this your boyfriend? No, no. He's in the class next to mine. His name is Masaki Miura. Nice to meet you, Mr. Miura. Shiraishi, you've been talking to yourself. They say this house is haunted. Let's get out of here! Wait! There's a young lady over there. Can you see her? I get it. You had an accident, right? This might be an aftereffect. Let's go! Don't forget this, Hotaru. Oh, right. We'll help you get out of here. Miura... I know. We should give her a name. Right! How about Eve? Because she's Adam's lover. Did she like it? Yeah. She says "Thanks." Eve, write anything in here. If we can find a clue, you should be able to get out of here. So Eve is dead. Let's help her go to heaven. Yeah. Isn't she scared, though? All alone in this spooky place. I've got the impression that it looks like a normal house to her. If that's so, it may be that she has lived here before. What looks normal to her must be the memory from back then. We'll check who used to live here after school tomorrow. Yeah. Hey! Is this a prank? Good afternoon. Go play tricks somewhere else. Excuse me. The old mansion over there... Come in. It's cold out here. A long time ago, the Kamijo family lived there. It's been about 20 years since the couple moved out. The mansion was too big for just two of them... and full of painful memories. It was too much for them. What happened? They had twins, a boy and a girl. There were four of them all together. The boy died in a motorbike accident. The parents were devastated. But thanks to the cheerful girl... they were coming to terms with the loss slowly but surely. She had a gift for music and her talent was discovered. She went to study in England when she was still in high school. They had great hopes for her future. But... their hopes were crushed. In London she fell ill... and followed her brother. She was only 19. They used to call me Mr. Painter, and I enjoyed their company. I was often invited to her concerts. She would've become a great pianist, had she not passed away. Pianist? Do you have a picture of her? You want to see? This is Sayaka... just before she went to England. I asked for the honor... of painting the great pianist of the future. S. K? Good afternoon. Miura... About a month ago, I found her in an alley in the neighborhood. But I couldn't bear to tell Hotaru. I didn't want to see her devastated. SYBELLE This is... me? No, I don't think this is you. But doesn't this painting help you remember anything? What did she say? Nothing. I don't think she has anything to do with Sayaka Kamijo. Sayaka Kamijo? Eve, what's the matter? Look at this! Initials on her necklace. S.K. Sayaka Kamijo! So... Adam gave it to me... for my 18th birthday. Adam... who's the girl you see in me? Eve is about the same age as Sayaka who is already deceased. And she has a necklace with the same initials engraved. Is this a coincidence? What? What is it all of a sudden? You said you were hit by a car on October 14, about 5 A.M. Right? And? You and Sybelle must've been in the place... where people pass through before they die. You mean, like the "Gate of Death"? Maybe something happened to Eve the same time you got in an accident! That's why you guys met. Found it! This is it! STUDENT IN COMA AFTER ACCIDEN STUDENT IN COMA AFTER ACCIDEN Sasahara Women's Music Academy? STUDENT IN COMA AFTER ACCIDEN Mizuki Mochizuki? Who was she going to meet? That's all I want to know. Tell me everything you know! How would I know? Her cell phone was off. Sorry. I apologize. I'm not blaming you. It's all my fault. But please go and see her in the hospital. Stop mentioning Mizuki! Just looking at you reminds me of that evening! Leave me alone! You know Miss Mochizuki? Mizuki MOCHIZUKI Mizuki, you have visitors. Please. I'll go borrow a vase. We must help her soul... return to her one and only body. - Here you go. - Thanks. Tomoki? Hi, Mrs. Mochizuki. Hello. Are you Mizuki's friends? Yes. These... Thank you very much. Tomoki says Mizuki helped you look for your cat. Yes. About a month ago. Do you remember the exact date? On October 13 or so. Soon after that, we found out that she was in an accident. Was she alone that night? Yes. I see. She had her passport with her at the time of the accident. Where was she going at that hour? And with whom? If you know anything, tell me. I wonder if Tomoki is her boyfriend. He didn't look like an "Adam." Eve will be glad to know... that Mizuki's body is where she should return. I'm sure she'll feel more hopeful. Right. Oh, damn! Steps. Oops, key! Shiraishi, what's Eve saying? She can't relate to Mizuki and that it doesn't feel like it's her. Eve... your body's still alive. We both saw you with our own eyes. We also met Mizuki's boyfriend... Tomoki Anzai. Says she doesn't know him... and that her boyfriend is Adam. The necklace that you treasure, that's from Tomoki. She says it's from Adam... and she remembers the time she got it. You freaks! You're no friends of Mizuki's. What kind of game is this? What are you guys thinking? Using her misfortune for your game? I'll make you pay for it! Listen to us! About Adam and Eve? Mizuki's here. Believe us! Give me a break! "Don't... please..." That's Mizuki's handwriting. What is going on? Tell me so I can understand! Our accidents were on the same day. Maybe that's why I can see her. It may be hard to digest, but... Hey. Look into the window of the sandcastle upside down between your legs... and you'll see your own future. I'll pass. Try it! Get up! Quick! All right. All I see is the sea. See now? Your future. What is it, Adam? Adam? You overslept again? The contest's soon. Eat and go practice. Dad... Oh, no. These came in a set. Now it's missing a pair. Mom! Hey! Seen my ring? It should be around here. Never mind. I had it on a different finger. Big Brother! Don't go! No, don't go! Let's move from here. Too many sad memories here. It's all in Eve's head. Eve never lived here when she was little. But she says... that her dad, an architect, and her mom... her twin brother and their cat Janosch... all lived here together. A business man. Mizuki's dad's an ordinary office guy. And she has no brother. Tomoki... So you believe us? I'm kinda stubborn. So I washed away my doubts with the rain. I'll do anything to get Mizuki back. Thank you. That's encouraging. She's probably imagining stuff. There's no boyfriend named Adam. Perhaps... she's being possessed by Sayaka's spirit? Eve told me... Adam used to play the guitar for her. I heard that song on TV. Don't know the details, but... So Adam's a professional musician? Maybe it was him. "Adam" is all you know? Guess you have to sing it, Shiraishi. What? No way! You're gonna help Eve no matter what. Right? That's probably Evil Eye. Evil Eye? Charismatic indie band in England about 20 years ago. Import analogs are all you'll find in Japan nowadays, I think. What a nerd! "Evil..." Oh, you know what? Their reprint CD will be out next month. Reprint? Hold on a sec. Here it is! See? Vocalist is Adam and the album title is "Last Quarter." Evil... Evil... Elvis... Elvis... Elvis... No, not Elvis... Evil. Here it is, Evil Eye. So this is Adam? Adam. This is it. This song. Awesome. Where's Adam now? Maybe back in England? Without knowing about Mizuki's accident? So, what does "evil eye" mean? Tomoki can do us the honor. It's believed to bring bad luck. In short, it's an eye that brings bad luck. Once it stares at you, you're doomed. That's what it is. And "last quarter"? Last quarter... Oh, that's easy! Of course I know. I go to college. But it may be a bit too early for you two. Maybe some other time. It's the waning moon. What? It means the moon in the waning phase. The moon waxes and wanes each month. There are four phases: New Moon, Waxing Moon, Full Moon and Waning Moon. They're also called: New Moon... First Quarter... Full Moon... and the moon in the final phase in the fourth week is Last Quarter. It's the week before the moon disappears. Why bother to ask, then? The moon shows its exact same face once every 19 years. That means, we can see the exact same quarter... only for a week every 19 years. Then tonight's moon is the same as the one 19 years ago? You know a lot about the moon. That... MAN ENCHANTED BY THE MOON He practices his lines with me. Now... that explains why you don't act your age. I see. Your dad's the famous actor. No wonder you're well off. He's dead. Finally. That's 19 years ago? So, when Mizuki was born... Adam was already dead. See? It's Sayaka's lost soul. Adam is half Japanese. "Killed himself by falling on purpose or drunk driving accident..." "The mystery remains." So it says. Adam died to follow his Japanese lover. It's so romantic to die to be with your love. How is it romantic? Adam might've killed himself. What a way to waste your life! Bet he went straight to hell. That's why he couldn't see Sayaka. Look! Isn't that Sayaka? Here you go. They remind me of John and Yoko. Always together. Adam... I'll never forget you. I won't leave you alone. I'll be reincarnated right away... so that I can be with you again. I promise. Adam... I love you. I happened to find it last night while sorting my stuff. The first and only letter she sent me. Thank you very much! I'll make sure it's returned to you. You're up to something? What's going on at that house? Who's that? My tutor! I have to go! Mr. Dojima. How are you? I'm going to a music school to study piano here in London. The lessons are very hard every day, but I'm enjoying my days here. I hang out with my friends after school who play rock... and we enjoy listening to many genres of music live. I will meet more people and experience many things... for myself and for my brother who couldn't. Please come listen to my piano again the next time I'm back in Japan. I promise you a more powerful and free-spirited performance. Please take good care of yourself. From London, Sayaka. How sad. She wanted to live. Sayaka's spirit is in search of her lost future... still to this day. But I can't sympathize with my enemy. She's trapping Mizuki in there. I'll chase her off. I want Sayaka to go to heaven peacefully. Then tell her Adam's waiting for her in heaven. Then Mizuki will go, too. Listen! It's Sayaka that needs Adam, not Mizuki! There's nothing between Mizuki and Adam who died 19 years ago. Please tell Sayaka the truth about Adam's death. Once she finds out about his death... her spirit will reunite with Adam. And Mizuki can return to her body free from Sayaka's spell. OK? Roger. Do you think you could explain it to Eve? Yeah. I wish I could tell her, but... I'm just a stranger to Eve. I'm counting on you. Where are you going? The hospital. I want to be there when she wakes up. I wonder where Adam is now and what he's doing. If only I knew... I'd grow wings and fly to him. Right away. Shiraishi, I'll talk to her if you don't think you can do it. What's the matter, Hotaru? You're not your usual self. We know where Adam is. What? Eve... No. Sayaka... Adam is not in this world anymore. He died to follow you Go to Adam, please. Adam is... dead? No! What's wrong? Eve! Be strong. You have a body to return to! No, I don't want to go back to how it was! I don't want a life like that! Don't be ridiculous! Adam's waiting for me. I have to hurry. I'm her father. I want to be with her. I understand, but... I'm her father. Let me be with her! Mizuki! Darling. - Dad... - Where the hell were you? I called so many times! Darling. Damn! What's going on? That's a song he wrote for me to get better. He wanted me to play it on the piano for his new album. He wanted me to get better soon to do just that. Instead, it ended up becoming my requiem. Adam played the song on his guitar. I was listening to it on the tape player at the hospital... when I died. Eve, you're Mizuki Mochizuki. Now you remember being Mizuki, but why do you speak as if you're Sayaka? I don't know. I was... born and died as Sayaka Kamijo. But now I'm living as Mizuki. That's all illusion! Adam is dead. You wouldn't understand! Adam saved me from solitude! Our week together here was definitely true and real! That last night, he asked me to go with him. He was there on the other side of the junction. If only... I'd made sure I got hit right, I'd be with him! No! Stop! We all want you back! Nobody needs me more than Adam does! Dad betrayed Mom... and Mom killed herself and left me behind. Tomoki, too! He betrayed me... with my best friend! It might be hard to find Adam... but I must go. Thanks for everything. Eve? Eve! Eve! Eve! Vanished? She hasn't come back yet. Damn! How did she get out of there? She was unconsciously trapping herself. She said she had given up on life as she knew it. I'm partially to blame. So I have no room to talk... but she needs to be strong. She needs to want to live for herself, or she won't live. Where could she be? The one place where she believes Adam is waiting for her! Adam! How can I be with you? Eve! Is she there? Over here! Eve, go back to Mizuki's body! Eve, I want to talk to Mizuki in person, too! You all right? Hey, listen! Mizuki! It's me! Your memory's back, right? Tomoki? I need you and... you need me! So please, come back! Trust me. Trust us and come back! This is a promise from previous life. Adam and I are alike. Call me a coward... but I belong there. Adam is probably... waiting for me... in the dark, all lost. Eve! What now? She's gone! What? She's gone to Adam. T.O. D: 0:23 A.M. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What? Tomoki... She just... Is Mizuki... What happened? Don't cry, you idiot! She's not dead yet! Our feelings must have reached her. I know that Mizuki will come back! Adam! Where are you? Open this gate! Tomoki? I need you... and you need me! So please, come back. Trust me. Trust us and come back! Stupid. I'm so stupid. Adam! Adam. I wanted to meet you in my next life. Why suicide? I missed you... Adam. I missed you so much. I know I promised... I wouldn't leave you alone and that I'd always be with you. Are you mad at me for breaking my promise? But... I... I want... I want to give... Mizuki Mochizuki another go. Thank you, Adam. Dear God... please take his soul to the most peaceful corner in heaven... with his beloved guitar... and cigarettes to keep him company... until I'm done living this life to the fullest... and this gate opens to me without effort. He and I lived our lives together... but he ran away from his karma. All alone, I embarked on a journey to find a new partner. Don't believe only what you see. Or the door will remain shut forever. Cut! Splendid! Bravo, Mr. Miura! Really? It was all right. Good job! Good job! Thank you, sir. My blazer... I mean, pleasure! Long way to Hollywood. Good job. Hey, have you seen Masaki? Oh, he left for somewhere. To see someone special. What? Who? A little taste of Japan... maybe. So, Sunday we're throwing my getting-well party... and Dad said to invite you, Hotaru and Masaki. Mom's preparing a feast, and my sister's excited, too. I'll sing then. Don't bother. You can't hold a tune! I've been practicing the F chord! My fingers don't cramp any more. What happened to the once lazy bum? Well... I've been thinking a lot... since then. What's the matter? This. It's from you, but... it reminds me of Adam. You can treasure all the memories of Sayaka and Adam... right here. We all might be reincarnations of someone. I could've been someone close to Sayaka. Like Janosch? He's a cat! Then maybe not! But... impossible things do happen in this world. Ah! Look. Last quarter moon. In 19 years, we'll be able to see this exact same moon. I wonder what we'll be doing then. I hope in 19 years... I'll still be with you, Mizuki. That's my wish. That, I think, is up to you. Huh? What's wrong? Nothing. Tomoki, let's live our lives to the fullest!
