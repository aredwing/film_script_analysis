Your expressions of love thru your eyes Targeting you and escaping from you, my love. When I saw you in my dreams, all my dreams came alive When I took a glimpse on you, I could not blink my eyes Do not change me like that Do not change me like that Do not change me like that In this misty morning like this.

Chandu, they are coming inside. Hey, catch him. Hey, come this side. Come fast. Sir, Chandu has escaped sir. Stop there. Chandu give me that bag. I thought you would be caught red handed with the fake notes. Just missed it. At least could work out twenty sir. Do not be under the impression that this is over. I will arrest you confirmedly. I just drew the money from the bank sir. You drew this from the bank. In that case come to the police station, show the bank receipt I know from where you got this money. Why are the police warning you? Chandu. What is happening? Meera, I need to tell you something. You never asked me why my father is in the jail and what do I do. But I have to tell you about myself. We used to live in a small village. My dad was a taxi driver. Have always seen my mother suffer due to illness. There was no doctor in the village who could diagnose her disease. And we were not rich enough to go out of our village and show her to a good doctor. So mom was fighting with her illness with the medicines the doctor used to give. My father worked really hard to take care of us. But he used to feel really bad for my mother. He did not want us to know about it and suffer. He made us study well. My sister wanted to become a doctor, so that no one else suffers like my mother. But one day. Hey. Sir, come here. I have some urgent work. We have to go to Bheemavaram. Ok sir. I will get my son along too. Why do you want to get him? He is not well. I will take him to the doctor. Okay. Go get him. I am going to Bheemavaram to get money from MLA, when I am coming back. I will stop the car wherever you want me to stop. I will get down from the car. Then you hit the car with DCM. Kill the driver and vanish the body. We shall create in such a way that the driver killed me and ran away with the money. After that we shall share the money 50-50 Hey dear, Chandu. Chandu. Dear Chandu. Sorry man. You wanted me to kill the driver so that we can share the money 50-50. But if I kill you and pay a lakh to the police, I can take the entire money. Sir, take this one lakh. I have not done anything. I have not done anything. They told that my dad killed him for money and transported the cash before the police arrived. My dad got life imprisonment. After few days of this my mother passed away. We had no choice but to join an orphanage. What are you doing here? I am studying. Get up. First finish the work I tell you. Then you can study. Could understand that I cannot make my sister a doctor if we stay there. We had no choice but to run away from there. One more boy joined also us while we were escaping. Brother, I want a Guava. Honesty is only useful to hear and read but not for survival. So, after that I understood only one thing. There are two people behind every fraud. Who does the fraud and who undergoes it. If you do not want to be second one, you have to become the first one. From then I started earning money like that Helping my sister study to become a doctor. Hello. Hey, have you gone mad. What happened sir. You are asking me what happened. Your father was to be released in another four days. why did he escape from the hospital now? My father escaped? Sir you please be there. I will come there immediately. Meera. Come let us go to the hospital. Sir. Hey, where is your father? I went to have tea. By the time I returned, both your father and sister are not here. We searched the entire hospital. Could not find them anywhere. Your father and sister are with me, so get the money immediately. Sir, please give me some time. I will get them back at any cost. All the papers required for the release of your father are ready there. Make sure that your father is there inside in the next four days. I will make sure that this matter will not come out of the hospital. Ok sir. Your dad after that will never be able to come out of the jail and you will even loose the money. Hope you have understood? I will come here exactly at 3'O Clock. If he does not come by then. I will kill you. Have you gone mad? If something would have happened to you there. Why are you talking like that? It is because of him you had to be in jail. I know, but will you kill him and come to jail. It is more important to make your sister a doctor than taking revenge on him. I do not even know who he is. He has not even seen my face properly. Please stop this here. Please promise me that you would not go behind me after his Promise me. Okay dad. Father. Chandu. Why have you come empty handed? Where is the money? Bro, that is. Bro what? Father. I will kill you father in one stab. I know it is you would killed my men and took the money. They were all dead by the time I reached there. Then where is the money. Where is the money? I gave it to the Home Minister. Are you planning to contest as MLA in the next elections? I gave him the money to release my father on August 15th for good behaviour. That is very nice. You would be happy. He has got profit. I am under loss. I will not take loss. I will repay your money back at any cost. Please leave them. Please. Do not tell all that. I will give you four days of time. If you are unable to get the money back, you will find both of them in the same hospital mortuary. After that I will kill you Dad, I am sorry dad. Please have patience for these four days. I will settle this at any cost. How will you arrange for so much money in such short time. Please believe me dad. Please. That is enough. Come let us go. Why are they here? They are here from the time you have gone inside. Hmm, go. What did he say? He said he would kill them if I do not give him the money in four days. What do we do now? First we should escape from this police Why are you late? It took lot of time to divert the police. What have you thought for arranging the two crores. I have planned something. but should get the right person. Who will help us now? He is a person who helps anyone in any problem.

If you all only discuss for what we for to sell tea or what is the Judge sitting here? Whatever you want to say it properly. Yes we will say, that is what I took fifty thousand for. Now tell me the complaints on my client. Pick pocketing and bank robberies. Did you do? No sir I did not. He is saying he did not do. Ok. Let us think that he did.

We will go to the High Court. This time we will appoint a good lawyer. Lawyer sir, they did not do justice to me sir. What is that you did? You are shouting in front of the judge, when he was talking. He got irritated because of that and he gave the judgment to hang. Tomorrow when you submit in the High court you accept all the crimes which you have done. So that the judge will show some mercy on you and give you a lifelong imprisonment. You can come out in seven years. What do you say? Lawyer sir .I will do whatever you say, lawyer sir. But you should take care and see that I should not get hanged sir. Okay. You do not worry.

What sir, why are you calling me? You will encounter me. You are not taking me to the High court. I promise on Bhagavad-Gita, I will tell the truth. I will not lie. Me Manikyam since the year 1985, I agree that I committed robberies, murders and cheated many people. Since the criminal has committed his crime the court has decided to give him life long prison. Manikyam. Turn that side and see. Two, take three thousand. My god, he is a lawyer. That guy is a judge. He came to take money. Why did you not understand? That day you came to the cellar to take the money. In this court you agreed all your crimes were true. Rest all is my plan. You clear all the payments. Oh my god. Oh my god. How much have you cheated me. Do not act so innocent Manikyam. You have cheated like that. How did I cheat you? Few years back. I wanted to take revenge on you. Education of my sister was important, so my father stopped me. The day you kidnapped my father and my sister, Then only you have decided your climax. I knew them that our relation should not stop with these two crores. You! I can understand your emotion. Think logically, you have become old already. By the time you come out of jail, you have to search for an old age home. So you will have a golden life. If you think no and still if you have grudge on me. Let us plan for part two. Ok, bye.
