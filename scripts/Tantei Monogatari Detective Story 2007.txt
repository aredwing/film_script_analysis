The really heavy one. Can you bring that? I'll put these boxes inside. Give me a break. Raita! Raita! You better treat me to a barbeque. Why do I have to treat you to a barbeque? What? What? What's wrong? Well, Raita, your neighbor... Are you Raita? Yes. My name is Raita too. Your neighbor is also Raita. I see. Well, my name is spelled in kanji with lightning and thick. Me too. Same? Same? Yes. Same? Same? Yes. Yes. Me too. That's a surprise. Yes. You're moving in? Yes. Yes. You're moving in, right? Yes. That's good. I'm Raita, your next door neighbor. Nice to meet you. I'm Raita, the next door neighbor. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. DETECTIVE STORY Hey. Was there ever someone who you really loathed that had the same name as you? Yeah. Really? What did you do about it? What do you mean? There's really nothing I could do, right? Of course not. What's wrong? Well, you see... Takashima. Were you able to hack into the OLM server? No, but I can do it easily. There are so many flaws. You're good. No wonder they call you the brilliant hacker. Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Yes? We have the same first name, right? Yes. Raita. This must be some work of fate. Let's celebrate your move-in. Let's celebrate your move-in. No, that won't be necessary. You don't want to? No, it's not like that... Right? Aren't you opening up your boxes? Ah... Well, I don't think I'll be staying here too long. What? Well, moving is like my hobby. Oh... Um, what is your occupation? Detective. Detective? That sounds like fun. Not really. Oh, please. I've seen it on TV. They fight bad guys and get into car chases and sometimes shoot people. I guess not. I'm good. You can't drink my booze? No... It's not like that... You don't like it? No, I'll drink it. Excuse me. I'm sorry to disturb you this late at night. Mr. Kazama? Mr. Kazama. Someone is here to see you. You should go back. Who? I don't know. Mr. Kazama? Mr. Kazama? Are you home? I'm Kazama. What do you want? I needed to talk to you, so I went by your office. They gave me this address. I see... Who gave you this address? A person named Nagamine told me. Nagamine? What is your name? Manami Inoue. Ms. Manami Inoue, huh? Is this an emergency? No, not really... Then, I hate to tell you this... ...but can you come back to the office tomorrow a little after 10? You're right. It's inappropriate for me to visit you at this hour. I understand. I'll come back again tomorrow. Miss Inoue! Are you okay? Hey, Nagamine. Did you give my home address to a person named Manami Inoue? I'm sorry. She seemed to be in a desperate situation. Fine. She's coming to the office tomorrow morning. I need you to deal with her. What? What about you, boss? Ah, so you drank too much again. Yeah, something like that. I'm counting on you. Kazama Detective Agency... Boss! I have bad news! I have bad news! Ouch! That hurts! Manami Inoue, that woman who came here yesterday! She was found dead this morning! What! Well, Manami Inoue, the woman who went to see you last night... ...was found dead this morning. What did you say? On top of that, her liver was missing. A bizarre murder, huh? Police are going to trace where she's been, so they'll be asking us questions. You're right. We're going to look into this case too, right? Nope. Our client is dead. What? I was really looking forward to investigating this case. You're such a happy-go-lucky person, Mika. In any case, this is not something we can handle. What is that supposed to be? I just remembered that the guy over at the barbeque place... ...gave me a piece of liver. Excuse me. Welcome. Mr. Shiobara. Long time no see. You look well. You look well. Yes. Yes. Raita. Yes. Raita. Raita. Yes. You know why I came here today, right? I don't know. What the hell is this? It's a fresh liver. I know that you don't have the guts to take on a wild case like this. You're a terrible cop. And you're a terrible detective as well. Mr. Shiobara. That's a nasty thing to say. You know it's true! You said you were going to do your best to fight for justice... ...but you quit and make money by looking into people's extramarital affairs? I may be a detective now, but my thoughts haven't changed at all. Then, why didn't you help that poor victim? Isn't that what good guys do? That victim stopped by your office before she was killed. You didn't do anything to help her out! It's impossible! A detective can't prevent murder! You changed a lot. Hey, Kazama. Don't think about doing anything stupid. I'm not Kosuke Kindaichi. I wouldn't do anything stupid. If you remember anything at all, give us a call. Are we done? Huh? What's wrong? My cell phone... Um, excuse me... I came here to give Mr. Kazama his cell phone. You're the one who called earlier? Please. Please. No, I just... I just want you to give him his cell phone... I'm sure he'll be back soon. Please. No, I... Please. Please. Thank you. Please. Please. Thank you. You like the art by Aoyama? Yes. You too, Mr. Takashima? Yes, I really like it. Isn't he wonderful? "Master of Tragedy. " There's something strangely appealing about Aoyama's art. His art has soul. It's unusual for a Japanese artist to draw religious pictures... ...but do you know why? No. The wife of Mr. Aoyama lost her sanity and killed herself. Really? Since then, he became an admirer of a German thinker named Rudolf Steiner. As a result, his work became more spiritual. So, the death of his beloved wife gave him an outlook on life and death... ...and he decided to draw religious art. That's impeccable. My name is Masakuni Nagamine. By the way, Masakuni is spelled... ...with the kanji "Miyabi" for Masa... ...and "Kuni. " Masakuni. I work as a detective for Kazama. But, Mr. Aoyama's art these days is somewhat different. You think so? I don't know how to put it... ...but something is different from his previous works, and it's not as appealing. Manami Inoue... Yes? Hello. I came to ask about Ms. Manami Inoue who lived downstairs. I told the cop about it earlier. What? Yoshio was already here? Hey! Wait a minute, you! Please take off your shoes! Yo! Raita Kazama! You recognized me? This really stands out! Are you serious? You got me. What are you doing here? What am I doing? I'm working my day job. Well? What do you think about this outfit? Looks good, right? Not bad. What are you doing here anyway? Gathering information. You're doing work that doesn't pay, aren't you? Shut up. Leave me alone. You should follow my example. Our business in the evening is making twice as much sales compared to last year. I'm sure you'll make more money if you're looking for missing cats. Being a detective is only business. What's wrong with making extra money? You know something, Ryoko? There's more to life than money. There are more important things in life. Did something happen? Did something happen? Nothing happened. Hey, you want me to help you? Since we're in the same business, I'll make it cheap. No thanks. I see. Bye. Hey. She's a fine woman besides that attitude. Someone was stalking her? Yes. Hold on a second. Someone was stalking her? Yes. We were in a different department, so I don't know the details. But, we had lunch one time... ...and she started talking about things like that. Talking about things like what? She said she got anonymous calls. She was thinking of reporting it to the police. Is that right? So it's like that... She said she got anonymous calls. She was thinking of reporting it to the police. Is that right? So it's like that... Looks like this isn't a case that a worthless detective can solve. What a waste. I should've helped. Hello. I found this by her feet. What's this? What's the matter? You look depressed today. There. No use crying over spilt milk. Body of a missing housewife found in the mountain! San-chan. Can you raise the volume? Sure. We're at the scene of the crime. This afternoon in the mountains of Okutama in Tokyo... That's not far from here, right? Among the things left at the scene... Among the things left at the scene... Nothing good ever happens these days. The victim has been identified... ...as Ritsuko Asanuma, a housewife from the Minato district in Tokyo. Ritsuko Asanuma has been missing for the past three months... ...and her family had requested the police to search for her. The police had been doing their best to find her whereabouts. Bartender. Bartender! Something wrong? Something wrong? It's nothing. The victim was found hanging from a tree with her kidneys removed. It's been determined that... ...she has been dead for a week and we now await the autopsy results. Kidneys this time? The police are tracing her actions that led to her disappearance three months ago. Boss? What is it? Cops are all over my apartment! They're there too? Maybe they're after you. Why are they after me? Anyway, I got a room for you at the hotel. Please stay there until things calm down. I love you, Nagamine! Nagamine. Yes? Besides, I have no motive. Plus, I've never met Ritsuko Asanuma before. Even Manami Inoue. I only saw her for one or two minutes at most. Well, there are many murders without any motives these days. The police must've found something of yours at the scene. What do you mean something of mine? Something that links me to those murders? Yes. But they don't have credible evidence. That's why they're trying to corner you by busting you with a minor offense. If they're going to bust someone, then go after the stalker! Stalker? It seems that Manami Inoue was targeted by a stalker. I'm sure that's why she came to us. The police don't know about that yet. I'm sure the police are going to question me soon... ...so I'll leak that information for you. Yeah, thanks. Also, let's try to make a list of the possible suspects that are living... ...near the victim's apartment. Thank you. Are you doing well with your investigation? I think I'll manage. But more importantly, I need to see that you're cleared of these false accusations. Thanks, Nagamine. I'm counting on you. Oh, don't be like that. It's not like we're total strangers. So, tomorrow Ms. Miura of the art association is coming? Then, Ms. Kimura can help him out. What? Me? I have a hard time dealing with that person. You don't like him since he's bald, right? It's only business, right? I don't like bald guys. What's wrong? It's nothing. Even so, his new work is amazing. Of course it is. This is the main attraction for this show. That new piece just isn't right. Yuki Aoyama... Would you like to go to this show with me? You want to go with me? Yes. I guess you don't want to, huh? No, I really wanted to go to this show! Then... But... Don't worry about me. I'm too busy to go anyway. Thank you. Well, I'd love to go! Baigetsusou... I haven't seen him around lately. Plus, there's no sign of anyone living there. Maybe he's on vacation? Since when? Maybe six months ago. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Is that right? Naohide Matsuyama... Away/Vacation... Naohide Matsuyama... I'm Manami Inoue. I often saw Miss Asanuma at the supermarket... ...or the neighborhood association meetings. But we just exchanged greetings. What kind of a woman was she? What kind? She was just like me. She was pretty and wonderful. Did she seem troubled by anything? Like, was she being stalked? I don't know. I guess she was troubled by her marriage. There were rumors going around saying that she was having an affair. An affair? Yes. I heard it was some good-looking guy at a bar. I'm so envious. Ah, Mr. Kazama, what's with that outfit? I'm a corporate worker. What? I'm just kidding. I can't attract that much attention right now. I think it's the other way around. That really stands out. You wearing all white. Really? Do you want something to drink? Well, give me a drink that Ritsuko Asanuma liked. Oh, you mean that person who was murdered? I wouldn't know what that person liked. Don't give me that. You would know since you were her lover. Stop joking around like that, Mr. Kazama. You know something? You can't hide anything from a detective. How did you find out? I was bluffing. I was bluffing. But, you just admitted it. Ritsuko was a regular customer. She came here all alone... I listened to her complain about her husband, and it just happened... She had a huge fight with her husband three months ago... ...and she came to my place to seek comfort. I felt sorry for her, so I decided to let her stay. But, she suddenly disappeared a week ago. Why didn't you report it to the police? It wouldn't be easy for me to tell them about our relationship. And I didn't know they were investigating her disappearance. So, I just waited for her to come back. Who could've... Who could've killed Ritsuko? This is amazing. How does he draw things like this? Mr. Takashima, which era of his works do you like the most? Mr. Takashima! What? Oh, sorry. Which era do you like the best? I used to draw a lot when I was in kindergarten. I haven't drawn anything lately... I haven't drawn anything lately... What are you talking about? I'm asking you about Mr. Aoyama's art. Oh! Well... I like his work from his twenties the most. He first started drawing at the age of 33. Oh, is that right? Excuse me for a second. Wait, where are you going? I need to pee. I couldn't hold it. Sorry. It's broken, so please do not use... Is anyone in there? What happened! St. Paul Children's Academy... Murder at Yuki Aoyama's Gallery... Body found in the toilet determined to be a day old... Father... These three victims had their organs removed while they were still alive. Liver for Manami Inoue... Kidneys for Ritsuko Asanuma... And our latest victim, Rio Nojima had part of her lungs ripped out. We found a plastic bag full of water inside Manami Inoue's abdomen. Also, we found some soil stuffed down Rio Nojima's mouth. Water and soil? What do the three victims have in common? Why does the culprit remove their organs? Also, why did he stuff soil in the victim's mouth? I believe these clues will be very important as we try to nail the culprit. Tell me about the suspects. Yes. Currently, these three are the suspects. Of the three, Raita Kazama uses the same fountain pen... ...that was found near the body of Ritsuko Asanuma. Also, before Manami Inoue was killed... ...she paid a visit to Kazama's detective agency. I'm pretty sure he's the one. Is Gamou doing well? He has a cold. Because of his body condition, he doesn't have much resistance to the cold. He wouldn't die even if you killed him. Long time no see. Yo. Good to see you're doing well. It's ironic. Even when I'm about to die... ...the spirits of those children won't let me die. There were five of them. One of them was a pupa. I feel sorry for your father. Money for court and medical bills. Maintenance fees for this place. You require more money than any other kid in Japan. I'm not a kid. It's already been 15 years. I still think about it a lot. If you hadn't caught me back then... I wonder how many more I could've killed. I don't think it would've changed the outcome. Bad guys can't get away with their crime. Is that right? The person who poured gasoline on me and burned me... ...wasn't charged with a serious crime since I killed that person's kid... ...and the court sympathized with him. Even though that person did a much crueler thing than me. I got a new face, you know. I'll show it to you. I kind of know the reason why you came here. It's about those bizarre murders, right? Get clues about a maniac from a maniac, right? Something like that. Try to understand his state of mind. Just like when you captured me. I want to hear your opinion. Is he just killing for fun? Whenever something like this happens... ...it's always a killer doing it for fun with an evil heart. If you think all bizarre murders are alike... ...then you won't understand anything. To him, insanity is not insanity. Insanity is not insanity? Right. Plus, the real nightmare lies in the paradise. If you can understand that in your heart... ...the answers will come to you naturally. Hello? I'm sorry. Were you working? I'm sorry. Were you working? Mika? I'm not working right now. I was wondering if you want to go out with me tonight. Huh? No? No, that's fine. Really? Then, can you bring your laptop to a certain location tonight? Laptop? Mr. Kazama, what are you doing here? You have a problem with me being here? Well... Police! Hey! I didn't do it. I'm going to prove it. You have to help me. You have to help me. I don't want to help! You're good with computers, right? I can't help you. I have a date tonight. Yeah, with me. Actually, I have a date with Mika. Are you stupid? Hey! I'm going home. If you're thinking about your future, I think... ...it's wise to be friends with your neighbor. ...it's wise to be friends with your neighbor. No! Please stop! Why are you tormenting me like this? It was just a coincidence! Hey! Important witness in the series of bizarre murders. Man named Raita Kazama. Hello? Is this the police? I just saw something amazing. I saw the important witness in the series of bizarre murders. What? Me? Well, it's an extramarital affair, so I can't really give you the details. What are you doing? I'm using the LAN at Matsushita Electronics to look at Manami Inoue's email history. I use it quite often for private use. You're right. That's amazing. You can do that? Yes. Wow. Please don't! Please don't touch. Am I bothering you? Please go over there. So mean. You're such a mean guy. You won't play with me, huh? Hey! They're here! They're here! They're here! What's wrong? What's wrong? The police! What? Wait a minute! You guys go up the emergency staircase! You stay here and guard this area, Koide! I'm heading up from here! Hey, Raita! Hurry! Don't press everything! Who cares! I'll just take whichever opens first! Hey! Come on! Hey! Come on! You think we can make it? It's not coming! Damn it! They couldn't have gone far! Here he comes! Sorry. Mr. Kazama. Huh? Why am I here? I don't know. You don't know? How long do we have to stay here? If we stay here till morning, I'm sure they'll give up. We have to stay here till morning? Shut up, you idiot! They'll find us! Shut up, you idiot! They'll find us! Sorry. Sorry. I'm kidding. Sorry. My vintage clothes are ruined. I don't care about that. I'm the victim, you know. Speaking of victims, did you find anything? Yes. Manami Inoue didn't have any friends or lovers. She was a simple girl. She just complained about work and talked about lunch in her emails. Going back and forth between work and home every day... She led such a simple life but was killed by a stalker. It's kind of sad. You're right. But, is the culprit really a stalker? What? If the culprit is indeed a stalker... ...why would he steal other people's organs? Maybe it means something. I'm sure there's a meaning to it. What? Raita Kazama? Mr. Matsuyama? You're in there, aren't you? Please open up. If you won't open, I'll just open it with a spare key. Sir, you can open it. Yes. You're Mr. Matsuyama, right? I'd like to ask you a few questions. You'll come with us, right? What happened to you? I took a bath. It's not a big place, but... Thanks for helping me out every time. Thanks for helping me out every time. No problem. Sorry for the trouble. Thank you so much. Thanks. There we go. This is the room. Feel free to stay as long as you like. Man, this is great. Sorry about all this. Sorry about all this. Not at all. Not at all. Thanks for everything. Not at all. The TVworks too. Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. On top of that... Free? Of course it's free. Hey, let's drink. I shouldn't. We now have new information on the series of bizarre killings... ...where the victims' organs were removed. We're reporting to you live from the scene. Currently, the police are doing all they can with their investigation... ...but one of the victims, Manami Inoue... I thought they caught the culprit. I know that house. It was on Nagamine's list. This man is being questioned by the police at this time. The man denies all charges made against him... ...but they found many videos with Manami Inoue... ...and many obscene videos along with several spy cameras. Now, they can focus on the whereabouts of the victims' missing organs. That sums it up. He's the culprit. To him, insanity is not insanity. It's not him. How do you know? He can be a Peeping Tom or a stalker... ...but there's no need for him to kill and steal organs. The culprit is more into spells and... Spells... Occult... I see... Liver and pond. Which means water. Kidneys and hanging... Hanging... Air. You were there at the scene when the victim was found at the gallery, right? Yes. Did you see any soil near the victim? How did you know? Someone said there was soil stuffed inside the victim's mouth. Lungs and soil... Lungs and soil! Do you get it? It's me. Is Yuki Aoyama still alive? Yes. Of course he is. I see. Is something wrong? No, it's nothing. Yuki Aoyama. He stands out among the artists in the current world of art. He is known as the "Master of Tragedy," and the "Artist of Madness. " After his wife's suicide, he becomes interested in Steiner. He was especially drawn to his ideas on the occult... ...and his artistic style... ...eventually becomes ghastly but turns unique with solemnity. Steiner was a German thinker... ...who had influence on medicine, philosophy, religion, and art. He thought that the human body was just a vessel... ...and by placing life, soul, and consciousness inside... ...it could then function fully as a human being. His ideas are very occult-like. The real nightmare lies in the paradise. If you can understand that in your heart... ...the answers will come to you naturally. Yo, Ryoko. Yo. Yo. Thanks for coming. It's all right. I don't have work today. You'll just reimburse me for transportation costs. What is it that you need? You want to hire me? You want to hire me? Yeah. I want you to get some information on Yuki Aoyama. Yuki Aoyama? Yeah. Why do you need his information? Don't ask. I want you to find out what kind of people he's been dealing with. I can't be seen in public, and Nagamine is busy too. Fine. I'll contact my employees and have them look into it. Good. Hey, is this about those bizarre murders? Correct. I want to know the connection between Aoyama and those victims. Got it. Don't worry. I won't report you to the cops. So tiny. Don't scare me like that! Idiot! So hot! Hold it! Takagi! Suzumori! Takagi! Suzumori! Yes. Boss! We got Kazama's fingerprints from that Zippo lighter we got. We couldn't get any... ...fingerprints from the fountain pen due to the metal engraving. But we definitely got it this time. Put Raita Kazama on the wanted list! Yes. Are you Maho Akimura? You're father is Yuki Aoyama, right? You won't believe what I went through. It was that guy with the same name as me. Oh yeah. I had to stick with him till morning. Give me a break! You should've just said no. I wish it were that easy. He's very pushy. I was up to here in water... I think I was... I think I was... Hey, hey. Look. Is it that person? Mr. Kazama? Mr. Kazama, what are you doing here? How did you get in without an ID card? Piece of cake. Don't underestimate a detective! This is bad. Raita, take care of this. Hey! Is that how you talk to someone for the very first time? It was me, Raita! He was talking to me! I knew that. I knew that... But I just had to say it. Why are you here? Well, I want you to help me out again. No, I can't. I'm working. There's no need for you to work. There's no need for you to work. Did something happen? There's a bunch of police cars outside. What's wrong? Excuse me! Does anyone have a box cutter? I just want to borrow it for a second. Thank you. Thank you. Hey! I have one. What? Why didn't you say that in the first place, idiot. Why are you in such a hurry? This is dangerous, you know. That's dangerous! What are you doing, Mr. Kazama? If you don't shut up, I'll slit your throat! Mr. Kazama, why? Kazama! I have no choice. Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Hey, Raita! Yes? Not you! Don't be foolish! Mr. Shiobara. I'm telling you I didn't do it. That's what I'm trying to prove. That's up to the police to decide! You just have to come with us and tell us the truth! No, I don't think so. I couldn't save that girl. That's why I want to catch the culprit so that she can rest in peace. Raita, you bastard! Yes? Not you! I'm sorry. Sorry about this, Mr. Shiobara. Damn it! Kazama! Move! Don't be such a fool. Get out of the way! The car! We're getting in that car! Good job! That was a great performance. That was no performance! I was really scared! What? Really? No way! Sorry it took so long. I got the information. Hey, thanks a lot. Those three victims were huge fans of Yuki Aoyama... ...but they weren't directly related to Aoyama. I see. Anything else? It's about Aoyama's relationships. After his wife Chie committed suicide... Aoyama started living with his lover. Mr. Kazama! Take it easy! His lover's name is Masami Seto, and she's a housekeeper. The reason why Chie became mentally ill... ...is probably because of Aoyama's extramarital affair with Masami. I see... And, what happened to Masami after that? I don't know that much about it. But, shortly after that Aoyama had a kid with an art student named Mizuho Akimura. A kid? Yeah. It's a girl named Maho. She's in a foster home. Where's Aoyama now? He has a studio in Izu, so he's probably there. Thank you. If you find out anything else, give me a call. Kazama switched his car by stealing another customer's. That bastard! Where the hell is he going? What the hell is going on? No one is picking up! It's me! It's me again. I forgot to tell you earlier... ...but Aoyama also had a kid with Masami Seto. A kid? What's the name? Masakuni. Spelled with "Ga" of Gagaku and "Hou" of Ihoujin. Masakuni? I work as a detective for Kazama. Mr. Kazama, the car is swerving to the left! It's swerving to the left! No way! That can't be! Did you tell a girl named Manami Inoue about this place? She seemed to be in a desperate situation. Fine. The only train running at that time is the central railway line. But, he lives in Ichikawa. Please grab the steering wheel! This is dangerous! If we don't hurry, there will be a fourth murder victim! You know who the culprit is? Where the hell is Mika? Please grab on! This is amazing. I didn't know you were friends with Mr. Aoyama. Yeah... Make yourself at home. I'll fix you some tea. Thank you so much. It's me. Were you able to find the answer you were looking for? Yeah. I knew it. I knew it ever since you caught me. You're just like one of us. Mr. Kazama, where exactly are we going? We're going to Izu. Yuki Aoyama's studio. Huh? What do you mean? Steiner is the missing key to this case. Steiner? He was a German thinker who mentioned the connection of mind and body... ...by using the four main organs, liver, kidneys, lungs, and heart. Those organs are the same ones stolen from the victims. Yeah. These four organs are very special compared to the rest... ...and they also correspond to the four natural elements. Water, wind, earth, fire. When all four come together, it is said to be complete. All four to complete? The culprit is using this idea to collect the organs... ...and using the victims in place of the four elements. Mr. Nagamine? Mr. Nagamine? Mr. Nagamine? Mr. Nagamine? Mr. Nagamine? Mr. Nagamine! Mr. Nagamine! Mr. Nagamine... Mother... I... I don't want to die... I'm scared... Masami... I... Want... Eternal life... I... Want... Eternal life... Dad... Where's... Where's mom? Looks like you're awake. How are you feeling? Mr. Nagamine... What do you think? It's wonderful, isn't it? My mother's drawing. My mother's soul is instilled in this drawing. This is the true ability of the great Yuki Aoyama. You're the one who was drawing them by pretending to be your father. Pretending? I wasn't pretending at all. I'm going to be even greater than my father. No! Don't come near me! I'm going to surpass my father. You'll never be able to surpass me. You'll never be able to surpass me. Shut up! Be quiet! After all, you're just an ordinary person. After all, you're just an ordinary person. Stop it! I hate you! You could never make art. Disappear! You ghost! Disappear! Disappear! Disappear! There's no need to worry. I'm just going to finish this drawing. After I take your heart, this drawing will be instilled with soul. Stop... No! No! No... No! No! Nagamine... You... Boss! You're Raita Kazama? You interfered. You idiot! Why did you do those things? Those things? It's obvious. Those women denied my existence. They said someone else drew it. But... I don't really like it that much these days. How come? Don't you feel that his style has changed? It seems like someone else is drawing it... This is Kazama's address. You don't want to go to the show? Why? I know he didn't draw them. No wonder you're an art student. You can tell that? Sort of. That new piece just isn't right. You didn't have to kill them just because they found out! It is considered a taboo... ...to say that Yuki Aoyama didn't do those paintings. They deserved to die! Besides, those women were my fans. So they should be very happy to end up like this. They were able to instill their souls into this painting and became part of this art. He's crazy... I'm not crazy. It's just like Masami. That day, Masami gained eternal life in the drawing. And, I touched its true beauty... Mama... Stop doing these foolish things, Nagamine. You have done some things that can't be undone.
