''I'll shower money on you if you become mine.'' ''I'll shower money on you if you become mine.'' ''Boy, can't you see?'' ''Like a girl you want me to be?'' ''My love is precious, baby.'' ''No money can buy me.'' Hello? How are you, Uncle? Bittu is absolutely fine. Everything is fine here. Don't worry. Hey! What? yes, Uncle. - Can't you see there's a film going on? So let it go on. Why are you getting irritated? yes, Uncle. I heard about my cousin too. - Let it be. He got only one vote in the elections? Hang up. I said hang up. Listen when you're kissing, I don't disturb you. So why are you disturbing me? And you want me to hang up? yes, Uncle, I was saying.. Uncle. your stupid nephew will call you after the film gets over. Sorry, very sorry. ''Boy, can't you see?'' ''Like a girl you want me to be?'' ''My love is precious, baby. No money can buy me.'' Don't you dare take the call! Hi, Uncle. There's no problem. Don't. - I met an old friend of mine. He was telling me.. Hey! Give me the cell-phone! Give me the phone! I said give me the phone. Hey! you threw my phone! How dare you touch it? Stop! - How dare you do that! Stop! - It will cost you dearly! What happened to my job? yes, I'm just uploading it right now. Is everything all right? There's a minor problem in the item song. Otherwise the rest of the film is a super hit. Will the film become a success? - Just like Sholay. Send it on time. - yes, okay. A hit film is coming. - Next Friday again? - yes, brother. yes, okay. Bye. What are you up to? Uncle? Nothing. Just doing some research. There's no point in hiding this. The police have traced your upload. They were coming to get you, but my reputation saved you. you caused me a loss.. - They would have handcuffed you. How many times have I tried to explain it to you? What are you doing? - How many times have I saved you? yet every time you manage to do something illegal. It doesn't make any difference to you. you'll never change. Do you even know the people you're sending this pirated film to? They're gangsters. your father had left them and you're going back to them. I will go. Do you have any problem? Doesn't it make any difference to you? I've loved you more than a son. Educated you and raised you. Doesn't it make any difference to you? you didn't do me any favour! My father was trying to do a good thing. you talked him into going to the police. What happened to him? your father was a good man. His blood runs through your veins. Please, son.. Nobody gives me a job because of my father's name. A thief's son will be a thief.. A gangster's son will be a gangster. That's how your world thinks. Son, there is good in you. you'll be a good man. I believe in this. There's God in every one of us. your God is not interested in me. I'm bad and will stay bad. It's good to be bad, you know. I'll do for you what I couldn't do for your father. Even if I have to sell my house or encash my fixed deposits.. ..or anything else. I'll get you out of here. If you stay here, you'll mingle with these gangsters.. ..and I for one will not let that happen. Just.. Just promise me you won't do anything wrong. Please. My hands will be in my pockets. I won't get into any trouble. I promise. Now tell me. I have a few friends in Australia. I can.. Be it America, Dubai or Australia.. ..I won't get a visa because of my father's name. I'm a policeman. If I can change your location.. ..then I can change your complete identity too. Excuse me. In the line. Hello. - yes. Hi. No English. - It's okay. Help. Can I? Okay. you can come too. By the way, I never do this. This is the first and last time. Thank you. No problem. you should learn to make your own line. Be it in an airport or your destiny. Suraj Bhardwaj from Mumbai. Romi Latti, from Gurdaspur. First time in Australia? yes. you? yes. Thank you. I've come on the McCarthy scholarship from Taylor College. Did you get any scholarship? Do I look like I'm capable of getting a scholarship? Absolutely not. No scholarship. The college must have sent a pick up for me. What about you? I'm going to take a taxi. Taxi. I think your pick up service is that way. Romi Latti from Hoshiyaarpur It's Gurdaspur. Okay, all the best. Romi? Romi Latti. McCarthy Scholarship. Hi. Suhani. I've come to pick you up. Shall we? - Let's go. What? No nothing. Just seeing you.. Seeing me what? you don't look like you're from Punjab. Because I'm quite good looking? Where are you from? My passport's Australian, but my heart is 100 percent Indian. 'Welcome to Melbourne and this is the Suhani and David show.' Two in one, you know. 'Desi show for Desi kids.' 'A show that celebrates Indian and Australian cultures..' '..and helps Indian students.' Our helpline is accessible 24/7 for you. 'Please call.' Two in one? It's pre-recorded. Wow! A pencil in your hair and bangles on your hand. you seem like the Mother-India type. Any problem with that? No, no. No problem at all. Just felt this way after listening to you on this helpline. you know I feel that people who are new to Australia.. ..should learn about Australian culture. Actually, you're right. Should we meet over lunch tomorrow? To learn about Australian culture. We're already meeting for lunch tomorrow. We are? My brother didn't mention it in his email? your brother? Listen. Before you say anything, I know why you've come here.. ..I know who you are and I can't marry you. What? Romi, I know according to my brother.. ..you're a perfect match for me. you've come on a scholarship.. ..and we are from the village etc. etc. but.. Hello! Even I can't marry you. Understand? Wow! There's no need to be so happy. I'm not that bad. No, no. I mean if my brother finds out, he's not going to be too happy. Can't you complete any sentence without your brother involved? And I'm sure your brother would also be present for lunch. you want some chips? For lunch? We'll get a Sim-card for you too. No. There's no need for that. Don't worry. I'm not paying for it. Our radio show has a charity fund which pays for this. And besides, we must take good care of you.. ..since you're a scholarship student. - yes. There should be some advantage of being a scholarship student. So then Coke, Pepsi, water, anything? What should I be drinking as per the Australian culture? And if your radio show funds people like me.. ..then it will go bankrupt in two days. Try to do something for others sometimes. It feels good. you should really try it. Don't pull the innocent girl's leg so much.. ..Romi Latti from Hoshiyaarpur. Hello. - Miss Suhani this is Romi Latti from Gurdaspur. Romi? - I'm not speaking from Gurdaspur airport. I'm standing at the airport and there's no here to pick me up. So.. - It's been half an hour. I'm just standing. Nothing's happening. What do I do? Wait there. I'm coming. - Okay. Golde.

It's a fact. - It's a fact. It's a fact. And in Golde's house, you'll have to split the rent.. ..and help in all the household work with your hands only. It's a fact. - It's a fact. It's a fact. - It's a fact. - It's a fact. Mrs. Golde, the fact is that money is a bit of a problem. Golde gives no lock without its key. I've secured your admission in college.. ..which gives you a visa for 11 months. As for the money, in half an hour Samarth from Gurdaspur.. ..will meet you at the taxi stand. He has a taxi business. So you're going to become a taxi driver. Taxi Driver? - yes! There's big dollars in the taxi business All for PR. PR? ''I need PR.'' ''Darling, I need PR.'' ''Darling, I need PR.'' No, no. I'm okay. you don't want PR? Have you come to play ludo in Australia? Without Permanent Residency there's no point in being here. you meant PR? There are two ways to get your PR. One, there are agencies. Give them money.. ..and they'll give you a work experience certificate. Once you get it. Next you'll attain your PR. And the second? The second way is to entice an Australian girl and marry her. Formula No.2. Exactly! Which we are not interested in. That's a fact. Right, Brother Golde? - you're absolutely right. Put some more spice. - I'm doing that. Brother Golde, can I tell you something? Brother, this taxi method is very long. - I see. Why don't we use the second method? Get an Australian girl and save the taxi's fuel. I can teach you some tricks to get girls. Don't act over smart with Golde. It's a fact. We will take the longer route. The rest of you do your work. Everyone gives big talks. Teach me a couple of tricks please. Golde's gone. Come on. Here keep this card. Now I wanted to tell you, if you fail this driving test.. ..I'll make you wash dishes in some Chinese restaurant.. ..to get my money. Okay? It's a fact. Get out of here. Come. Come in.

It's a fact. It's a fact. - yes, very good. I got it. Now let's go. - Come on. Come on. - Now drop him off to Samarth's. - Okay, sir. All the best. - Bye. This man is a bit intimidating. Mind it. How did you get this scratch on the cab? What did I do? That Australian customer started telling me.. ''you Afghanis have come here and corrupted our land.'' Now you tell me. Do I look Afghani? I am a pure bred Sikh. But how did you get this scratch? Well, I told him, ''Afghanis have done nothing.'' ''you guys went and bombed their land.'' He basically got angry and then scratched my cab. And you let him go? yes, I let him go. Golde has sent you? yes. you want to drive a taxi? yes. Why? Sir, ever since I was a little kid I had only one dream.. ..to grow up and become a taxi driver. What would you do if you were in Jolly's position? I'd beat up that Australian. How dare he scratch the cab? Romi Latti will tell you. Where are you from? - Don't you know Hindi? I do know it.

Suhani, why didn't you tell me what happened? That's what I'm telling you. - Sir, I'll leave. It slipped my mind. That happens sometimes. Brother, don't mind. How the heck did it slip out of your mind? If I find him, I'll break his bones. Relax, brother. There's no need for that. If I find him, I'll tell you. But it was nothing serious. Sir, I'll leave? Why? Don't want to drive a cab? No, I thought I failed the test. Come and collect the taxi tomorrow morning. I'll get your license made. Thank you, sir. Ma'am. Romi Latti from Hoshiyaarpur. It's Gurdaspur. Uncle, you have nothing to worry about. I've got a good job here. Thank God. - I suggest you too come here. What's in a policeman's job? Everything is set for me. Formula no.2.. - Hi.

Cheer up. you're going to be my wife soon. Sorry, I hope I didn't hurt you. Don't you have any other work to do? Of course, I do. In fact I'm looking for a job. As soon as I get one I'll take you out for dinner. Come on, guys. Do something. No scholarship, come on. We need to make our team win. Cheer them on with me! you should've got a dance scholarship.. ..Romi Latti from Hoshiyaarpur. It's Gurdaspur. Don't distract me now. Well done! We won! We won! We won! your yet-to-be-husband is dancing a bit too much. Come, I'll drop you home, girl. Get out of my way! Just get out of my way! What's your problem? What are you doing? What's your problem? I was just dancing. What's the problem? Only dance. What's so funny? Brother, we should let this go. We're in the minority. One who fights many bravely is a true follower of Sikhism. Avoid all trouble. Avoid all trouble. Let's go, boys. your brother turned out to be like Genghis Khan. Angry all the time. Is it necessary to crack a joke every single time? It's the same drama with these rascals each and every time. They start up a fight and then blame it on an Indian. I'm telling you. They are going to do something. I know it. The time has come when we all need to unite. We have to do something. We must do something. Before they enter our house and insult our culture. That rascal got away. If it wasn't for the cop, you would've totally beaten him up. Brother, Romi shouldn't have danced like a monkey there We should also respect their culture. But I was just.. - No. No. It's true that we Indians are no less. But I agree with Suhani. What you did was wrong Romi. Very bad. Very bad. Very bad. What wrong did Romi do? What culture are we talking about? What is their culture? Having babies without being married. Sleeping around carelessly. Is this their culture? Or the fact that their ancestors were criminals doing their time. They are all descendants of criminals. And they talk about our ancient culture. Culture. yet again the siblings have come to receive an Indian. Brother, you're falling for this girl. No. In fact, I'm trapping her. Formula no.2. Get the girl and get your PR. Just tell me how long will this take? Golde has worked on the car not some cheap labourer. In exactly five minutes, the car will stop running. Suhani. Samarth. What are you guys doing here? Can't you see our car broke down? you're in luck. Golde is a mechanic. He'll fix it. Come on get to work, Golde. With your hands only. Me? yes, me. Looks like an electrical fault. I just dropped some Indians and Pakistanis to the airport. This is going to take an hour or two. That's a fact. - Why? Now what? - I need to check the whole car. No problem. I'll drop you. Till then Golde can fix the car. Right, Golde? you go home. I'll wait here with the car. In any case, this area is not so safe. you have your cell-phone, right? - yes. Call me when you get home. Should we get the bags? Thank you so much for dropping me to college. No problem at all. Someone had dropped me off when I first came here. But the one who dropped me was really special. Don't you talk a bit too much? Please I'm not that bad. In fact, I'm much better than your helpline. Actually, for once in your life I think you're right. At least you don't bother me 24x7. I can do that too if you want. 24x7. But you need to stop hiding under this Mother India mask. Sorry, what's that? It doesn't suit you at all. So what suits me exactly? It's time you remove this pencil from your hair. That's better. you mean on silent mode? Why? Will your brother be angry if you switch it off? Anything else? And these intense lips of yours.. ..should now have a lovely and beautiful smile. Okay, have I changed now? Are you guys fighting? Please carry on. Golde. yes, Golde. Dude, I messed up. I got overexcited and ruined the entire wiring of this car. Now this car cannot be fixed. How much more time? Five minutes? Five minutes? It will take five hours at least. That's a fact. No there's no need for you to come here. Do me a favour and take Samarth home. Make sure he has a cold drink, since he's always so hot headed. And listen don't take any money from him. I'll make him eat lunch if you want. you know he's family. - I'll take money from you. How long do I handle this? Okay bye. - Hello? There are two ways to attain your PR here. The first being the long route. Give money to the agencies money.. ..and you'll get a work experience certificate. And the second? The second way.. Suhani. Romi, what are you doing here? Second way. - I'll tell you later yes, I got this job yesterday. In fact, Samarth helped me get it. Nice. Congrats. I was thinking that since I got a job now you and me.. dinner? Dinner? Well, I'm a bit busy today. But we'll plan it. Let's do it. How much for this? $5 AUS. The second way? Later. Let it be. I'll take care of it. No, that's fine. Thank you so much. Bye. The second way? Stop repeating the same thing again and again. Go wait in the car. I'm coming. Go on. - yes. Romi Latti from Gurdaspur. Hoshiyaarpur. He got it right this time. Why are you so upset? Suhani forgot to take her change. Don't take it to your heart. Actually she's really sad today. Why? What happened? Well, Samarth's car broke down on the highway. Can I take this? - yes. And there's no one to help. Can I take this as well? - yes. I wish there was someone who could help him. I can help. I can help. yes, I completely forgot. Go. Go help him. Suhani will be very happy. Shall I take this? - yes. And this? - yes. Okay bye. That's $10 AUS. Billu, handle the counter. Can we go? Suhani, to hell with those who don't value us! Don't worry I'm going. Poor chap! He's gone mad. you turned him down for dinner. Nice boy. your car is ready, sir. Top notch quality. Oh, no! Where's the smoke coming from? No! No! The engine might have a problem. I'll just check. Just a second. Where are you going? Wait for two minutes. Have patience. Wait a second. I'll fix it. Brother, you didn't tell me the second way? Later. I'll call you. - Okay fine. What? What was he asking you? Nothing. He was saying something, right? Why do you over react on every single thing? And speaking of over reacting, want to go watch a film? There's a drive in close by that plays Hindi films. you want me to go for a movie with you? Look, I know you're not allowed. And if your brother finds out.. Shut up. If we compare our favours.. ..then that day you picked me up from the airport. I'm dropping you today. So.. So we are even. No, but you also didn't rat me out to your brother. So a movie for that? What's the logic? Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Stop it. What are you doing? Stop it. Please. Please. Please. Film please. Get up! Please. Please. Okay fine. Which film is it? Oh my God! Heat it up a little more. ''I'm living without myself.'' ''I'm swaying in your aura.'' ''I don't know how I became yours.'' ''I think I'm what your heart prayed for.'' ''I started living since I found you.'' ''I hope this moment lasts forever between us.'' ''I started living since I found you.'' ''I hope this moment lasts forever between us.'' ''I'm living more than I used.'' ''Ever since our hearts have connected.'' ''I'm walking on your path.'' ''you're my destination and I'm at your feet.'' ''I started living since I found you.''

''your looks have a new style and you give a different high.'' ''After so many days you have finally opened up to me.'' ''My actions lie within your limits.'' ''Now where do you have to go?''

''I started living since I found you.'' ''I hope this moment lasts forever between us.'' ''I started living since I found you.'' ''I hope this moment lasts forever between us.'' I know you would have enjoyed yourself at dinner.. ..with Romi Latti from Hoshiyaarpur. It's Gurdaspur. Whatever it is. your yet-to-be complete man. Don't be mean. He's not that bad. And if you look at it, he's very intelligent. He's here on scholarship. He's from the same village as I am. He's always honest and my brother likes him too. And who do you like? you know if it were up to your brother.. ..he would ban you from smiling. No, he was not always like that. After my sister's death.. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.. No, that's okay. After my sister's death, he just became overprotective. I see that's why I never get an opportunity. Opportunity? If you had one, what would you do? Come close to you. Then come. And? And I would hold your hand. And? And exactly what you're thinking. What am I thinking? What I can't say. ''I started living since I found you.'' ''I hope this moment lasts forever between us.'' ''I started living since I found you.'' Brother? Brother, this blood.. Are you okay? - Don't. What were you guys doing? Where were you? I went.. I went to see a film A film? That's why you sent Romi to the highway.. ..so that you could go with him.. Romi? Romi was mugged on the highway. Here we are getting attacked by Australians.. ..and you went to watch a film? you should have seen his condition. I took him to the hospital alone. Had I not reached on time, he would've been dead. I kept calling you for help, but your phone.. All because of you. All because of you. Samarth, it's not Suhani's fault. Actually, we were.. Did I ask you anything? If I ever see you near her again.. ..I'll break your legs. Come on. 'Show. Show. Show.' 'Wait. - Please show. Show it. Not fair.' 'Okay. Sheena, come on, smile.' 'I don't look nice here.' 'Smile.' 'Brother's never going to understand.' 'Just chill. What's wrong with you?' I think if it's a boy he'll be a football player. 'And if it's a girl then an astronaut.' 'Sheena ' 'Chill. I'll convince him. He loves me a lot.' 'Who is this man for whom you're turning your.. ..back on your family for!' 'Brother, I love him. I love him, Brother.' 'What will our community think, Sheena?' 'I want to live with him. He loves me.' Big plans you had of kissing her. you got slapped instead. But why didn't you retaliate? you should've given him 2-3 slaps back. you have to do these things for PR. Besides it was her older brother so I couldn't say anything. you big shot Ferrari owner! Easy. Easy. Be careful. Be careful. you will fall down. - you are telling me to be careful! Be careful. We Punjabis talk loudly. We don't fall down. Oh no. Get up. Get up. And if we do fall, we fall with pride. Okay. Okay. - Got it? - Come here. Listen to me. Listen to me. Tell me one thing. What's Samarth's problem? Why can't he let Suhani live her life? Listen to me. Their entire family is crack. That's a fact. What exactly are you? And what did you just address me as? Hey, boys. you need a ride? Hey, Formula No. 2. Hop in. yes, we're coming in your car. We are going to Jalandhar. Walk into our house. Till today.. till today nothing like this has ever happened with me. Forget it. Tomorrow I'm going to hold her hand in front of her brother. That's a fact. Are you some kind of broken record? Look at this woman. She's right here. Listen to me, she has an Australian passport just like Suhani. you just want your PR, right? So let her be. Cheers to your love. Cheers to your PR. Cheers to both of us. you've seen me in lesser, haven't you? I have? Coffee? So.. - So? Last night? Oh, you and your friend fell asleep in the back of my car. He jumped out of the car screaming some Formula No. 2. I didn't know where to take you so I got you here. Okay. And.. - And? Something happened? Don't worry. you're still a virgin. I'm not a virgin. So you're a player then? No. I'm.. It's just that I'm not that kind of guy. Okay, Mr. Not-That-Kind-Of-Guy.. ..you're not as much of a player as you make yourself out to be. you're not as bad as you think. Hello. Hurry up. Let's go. Hurry up. Let's go. Let's go. - Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Keep moving. Hurry up. yes Golde, tell me. Where are you? Do you know that Jolly's gone? What does that mean? Samarth has held a protest in front of the police station. Jolly landed up there to participate and the police caught him.. ..and found his illegal papers. Now if he stays here we'll all get caught. He has to go back to his native place. Where do you think you're going? Police arrested Jolly. Go back. I'll slap you. Go back into the house. Do you also want to get arrested like Jolly? But Jolly, my brother.. Suraj, listen to me you make sure you don't go there. you shouldn't go there. This is not our fight and we're not going to get into this mess. Think about your PR. Get out of there and come home immediately. 'The traffic at Church Square is disrupted as hoards of Indian..' '..immigrants have poured in huge numbers to protest against..' '..the recent attack on another Indian student.' 'The Indian Channels have been playing..' '..the news of this attack calling it a racial attack.' We want justice. We want justice. We want justice. We want justice. We want justice. We want justice. We want justice. We want justice. We want justice. My name is Romi Latti from Gurdaspur. I'm a student just like all of you.. ..who has come to Melbourne, Australia.. ..for a better life. Last night a few Australian boys dragged me.. ..out of my tow truck and hit me. They dragged me through the concrete of the highway and hit me again. At first I thought they were just robbing me.. ..but I realised later that I was just being punished.. ..because of my colour. Because I'm an Indian. I'm sure there are people here today who have.. ..witnessed the same brutality. 'Please, Brother. I don't want to die. Please, Brother.' I want to go back home but what will I tell my family when I go back? I came back a loser, defeated? Brother, please! 'Sheena!' Not just me, no one standing here would like to go back home. Justice. I can't change what happened to me but.. ..this cannot happen with anyone else. With Samarth's help I'm pleading to the Victorian police to come ..here and assure the safety of Indian student.. What are these guys doing here? Brother, I've called them. David and his friends have come to support us. Till they.. Suhani don't you remember what they have done to us? Brother.. Arrest him. you.. Officer.. Brother.. Why did you go there? I told you to stay away from the police. But you seem to have ants in your pants. Now here, keep this money.. Brother, you have already done so much for me. How will I repay you? Now you're going to start teaching me about money? Will you go empty-handed to your mother? My reputation is at stake here. Don't worry. Golde knows how to get his money. I'll make sure I get it from all these boys. That's a fact. Now stop crying like a girl. you're crying too. Forget it now well throw you a farewell party, Punjabi style. We must show these Australians. It's a fact. Right? Suraj, there's someone for you. Why didn't you wait, Suraj? Why? Whatever happened today should not have happened. I still believe that till Australians and Indians.. ..do not help each other, understand each others problems and cultures.. ..there will be no solution to this issue. My brother should not have hit David today. But keeping mum about it also is not going to resolve this. Sometimes it's better to keep mum Suhani. I had a friend, Jai. His father was involved with the underworld. Threatening people and scaring them. Smuggling. A few months back there were blasts in the city.. ..which killed a number of people. 'These blasts killed many people..' '..and changed the lives of a number of people.' 'Papa, bang-bang.' '109 people have died and more than 700 have been injured.' When Jai's father found out that the blast occurred.. ..with the help of the RDX he smuggled in.. ..he decided to go confess to the police. He had a friend Sub-inspector Joseph Pinto in the police force. 'How? - Joseph, that RDX landed at my port. Joseph..' He told the commissioner everything when Joseph made him understand. 'Stay right here with the uncle, Son. I will be right back.' 'Hello, sir. I made a mistake, sir.' To get a medal the commissioner.. Did what for his medal? If he would've kept mum, he would have been alive today. Joseph too never complained and Jai was left all alone. Suhani, I decided from that day on.. I'm not looking for any solution. This isn't my problem. I don't want to get involved in this Indian-Australian issue. you know Suraj, Jai's father's life was not wasted. He took a stand for a good cause. At some point in life you have to take a stand. you know the world will not be destroyed by one bad man.. ..but by the silence of a thousand good men. you need to help. you need to help me. Help you for what, Suhani? It's so easy for you to say this because you're from Australia. Till I don't get my PR I have certain limitations. Got it? And what stand are you talking about? you're going to marry Romi.. ..because your brother finds it appropriate. you can't take a stand in front of your brother. Before taking a stand for the whole world.. .. take a stand in front of your brother, Suhani. Please leave me out of this. Okay? you're right. If you're not with me, you're against me. ''A dude came from India.'' ''A dude came from India.'' Well done. Well done. ''A dude came from India.'' ''A dude came from India.'' ''He started to work there.'' ''Money attracts the heart.'' ''So he drives the taxi day and night..'' ''..and earns a lot of dollars.'' ''Oh.'' ''He has left his job there..'' ''..and started falling in love.'' ''His eyes met someone.'' ''He liked someone..''

''Play, a little touch alone with the lady.'' ''Feel the song, Baby, get it on, get it right.'' Good going. Enjoy yourself. He kissed her. He went for it. ''Tell me what you thinking about tonight.'' ''I want to do everything. I want to do it right.'' ''May be, I can help you free your mind.'' ''Open the door you and let me in, I can check upon it.'' ''Let go me, I will ever take an initiate.'' ''Proximity is the key, don't you hesitate.'' ''Give in to the feeling that leads the way.'' ''We are going to.. we going to get it.'' ''If you're not there, there's no problem.'' ''There are other women..'' ''..who have caught my eye.'' ''If you want to go, go, I don't care.'' I love you. Me too. you love Suhani, don't you? No, I don't. Then what did you go to the protest for? How do you know that? I know things. I mean I went there for a bit but.. How do you know that? Someone told me. May I ask who? Same people who attacked that guy on the highway. Same people who would have had you fixed if you had helped her brother. They're going to get Samarth when he comes out of prison. But don't worry, they won't harm you now. you're with me. Get ready. His car is in the subway car park. And you're friend is checking out. I owe you one, boss. Get off me. Get off me. Get off me. Get off me. Get off me. Get off me. Let's go. Oh no. 'See no evil, hear no evil, man.' I need some help here. Come on! - yes, sir. Quick. Quick. - Hurry up. Will he be okay? Take him to the doctor. - Will he be okay? Will he be okay? - yes, yes, sir. He's going to be okay. We're going to take care of him. I'm just going there to see if he's okay. I'm just.. I'm just going.. - He's going to be okay. Okay. Alright. Alright. - Alright? 'Violent attacks on Indians in Sidney and Melbourne..' '..are becoming a serious diplomatic issue for Australia.' 'The Indian government is demanding.. '..the authorities here to make a move to stop the attacks.' 'There's been relentless coverage of the story by the Indian media.' 'They are calling the attacks to be racist in nature.' That's our guy. Can you run that again? Zoom in. There's our witness. Get me details on him. Call them in. Hands up. Hands up. Hands up. Russ. - you are under arrest. Come on, head down. Who did you tell? Nicole, answer me. One of your curry munching friends lands up on my turf. Mel gets arrested. Who's this guy? Are you sleeping with him? you did, didn't you? you.. Jesus. Oh no. Comas generally last a few days to a few weeks. I mean your brother could come out of the coma tomorrow.. .. or it could take 20 years. Even after recovering he may face physical.. ..intellectual and psychological difficulties that.. ..need special attention. We have a special unit which looks after patients suffering from comas. Go up to the fourth floor I've spoken to Dr. Philip. He'll help you out. I'll go get the reports. Suhani, are you okay? - I'm fine. Where are you going? I need to get those reports. I'll come with you. - No need I'll get them. I'll come. Suhani, he will be fine I'm sorry. - Sorry for what? That day at the protest when the police.. ..were taking brother away I just wanted you to come. Everything would've been fine. I couldn't understand your problem, the limitations you have. And today when he was.. you could have left him alone if you wanted to. you took him to the hospital in spite of him insulting you. Samarth was right that if we don't help each other then who will. I'm going to the police station in the evening.. ..to file a report on the attack. Will you come as a witness, please? No. Suhani, I'll just come back in two minutes. I forgot my cell phone. Two minutes. Okay. you're a good liar. you should carry on. I just came here to tell you that my brother has people everywhere. I wouldn't testify if I was you. They're watching you, Suraj. I understand that you saved him. Even that you took him to the hospital.. ..but what is the need to go to the police station? I'm telling you, this isn't our battle. you're PR will become a dream if something goes wrong. That's a fact. All right, let's do this. He's in the next cabin. Suraj. Suraj? Officer Glen, hi. I'm Suhani. Samarth Singh's sister. I spoke to you earlier. - Have a seat. Tell me. This is Suraj Bhardwaj and he's here to testify as a witness. What are you doing? They're here now. Keep them there. I want to fix her brother first. Get it done soon. I can't hold them much longer. I've lined up some suspects. All you got to do is pick them out.. Okay? Excuse me. yes? Sir, can you come in here now please? There's something I would like to show you. I'll be right there. Just a minute. What happened? Something's fishy. How did the people who attacked Samarth.. ..know the time he left the police station? Hello? - Suhani, what the hell is going on? These guys are asking me to leave the hospital. Something's wrong here. I'm going nowhere. I'm going nowhere. - Romi. Sir, I think you should check this out. It seems your witness has a criminal record back home in India. Where did you find this? I have some contacts with the police in Mumbai. I asked them for his record and this is what they came up with. Alright. They've escaped! Raise the alarm! Raise the alarm! Check the fire escape! Suspects are Indian male and female. Where the heck is this guy? you're in this state because of me, brother. But I feel more helpless. We're constantly on the run. Even after being fully functional I feel so helpless. But now I won't stay silent. I'll stand up for you. I'll fight for you. ''In you I find the need to live.'' ''I ask you to find the way for me.'' ''In you I find the need to live.'' ''I ask you to find the way for me.'' ''I constantly get your support.'' ''I live in your arms.'' ''Where can I go now without you?'' ''I constantly get your support.'' ''I live in your arms.'' ''Where can I go now without you?'' 'We've just got news that..' '..a stranger has killed a couple of mixed race..' '..who were getting married.'' 'According to the police, we've got confirmed information..' '..about murders of three such married couples.' ''you gave me light in the dark.'' ''Every breath of mine is in sync with you.'' ''I started feeling my destiny in your hands.'' ''The ambience has blossomed.'' ''All the sadness has gone.'' ''Where can I go now without you?'' ''I constantly get your support.'' ''I live in your arms.'' ''Where can I go now without you?'' 'Barely had the city recovered..' '..from the horror of this serial killer..' '..butchering couples who had married outside their community..' '..when the news of the strip club being torched hit the nation.' 'Twenty five men and women have died in the fire so far.' ''And about 50 are seriously injured.' 'Police have found clues to last night's explosion at Dukes..' '..a popular strip club in suburban Melbourne..' '..leading to Suraj Bhardwaj a man of Indian origin.' 'Police are yet to reveal more details of the accused.' 'Here's an account from the employee of the club.' 'This Suraj used to come here often with lots of Indians.' 'They used sick photos as well.' 'Have you ever met him?' 'No. No.' 'I didn't really know him.' 'As the attacks on Indians has increased..' '..they authorities are showing great concern..' '..that the situation may get out of hand.' 'A red alert has been sounded through the city of Melbourne.' What are you doing, Suraj? Don't.. don't let this affect you. They will pay for whatever they are doing and saying in the news. They won't have to pay for anything, Suhani. It's not a fair world. They've been doing this for years. Samarth was right. They lie first and then blame Indians for the mess they created. This time they're using my name and blaming the Indians. Trust me justice will be served because you're innocent. Indians and Australians will come together. We can bring them together. And nothing will happen with whatever they're saying or doing. They can't hide the truth. What truth are you talking about, Suhani? you want to know the truth? My name is Jai Dixit not Suraj Bhardwaj. I came here on a fake visa from Mumbai. My papers are bogus. I have only lied all my life. That's the truth about me. you want to know one more truth? Want to know where I'm going right now? you think it was mere coincidence that I was there.. ..when Samarth was being attacked? No, Suhani. That night after we fought, I spent the night with Nicole. Nicole is Russell's sister. She informed me about Samarth being attacked. And that's how I went to save him. That's why she is now blaming me for the blast. She's conspiring with the police. Suhani, this world is not such a nice place. And I'm not such a nice guy. That story about your friend was your story, right? No, that was only my father's story. My story will have a different ending which I will write. Not these Australians. Please don't do this, Jai. Stop! Stop! Please listen to me please. Jai! Jai, please don't do this. I've seen this happen in my own house. Nothing will get sorted. Please! Just please don't do this, Jai! Get out of the house! I want to know where Russell is. Don't fool me! - Get out of my house. Where's Russell? Stop fooling around. Where's Russell? Russ! He's got me. He's going to kill me. No! Let go of me! No! No! It's me. I've got your little sister. I've got Nicole. What are doing with Nicole? you have no idea. you can't even imagine. I will find you and I will peel of your skin. you stinking snake! If you touch my little sister.. ..I will find yours and I will slit her throat! Do whatever you want. Samarth? No! No! Somebody help me! Samarth, what are you doing? - No! Let go of me! Samarth! - Let go of me! Get off me! Samarth, why are you taking revenge from Russell using Nicole? Samarth! Samarth, what's her fault? What was my sister's fault? 'Okay, come on. Another picture. With me.' 'Sheena, come on smile.' 'you're pregnant with an Australian man's child, Sheena.' 'Sheena, you'll have to abort.' 'I'm sorry, brother. Please, brother.' 'Who's this guy for whom you're turning your back on your family?' 'Brother, please. This is my child.' 'What will happen to our reputation in the community?' 'What community, brother?' 'Brother, I love him. I love him.' 'This is my child. I want to live with him.' 'Sheena, who is he? - He loves me.' 'We'll have to abort this child.' 'No please. No please.' 'I'm doing this for us. I'm doing this for you.' 'I'm really scared.' 'Nothing will happen.' 'I don't want to die. - Don't worry, Sheena.' 'Sheena! 'Sheena! 'Sheena! Till today I hear my sister's cries. Now it's sister for a sister. Take a look. Take a great look at this face. All these years I've been waiting for this moment. It was me who was in love with your sister. The kid in her belly was mine. She was pregnant with my child. you'll kill his sister and he'll kill yours. What about Suhani, Samarth? When Parshuram left to kill Aryan kings.. ..do you know who he killed first? His mother. With no weakness, who will stop me? I'll do anything to protect my roots, culture and tradition. Suhani is not my weakness. I'm doing this for my people. No Indian will ever suffer again. Never. With Nicole's death they'll understand.. ..that we are no longer weak. you've gone insane, Samarth. I didn't think of one small thing. Who should I put this blame on? I'm glad you came here. The police will be here soon. And by the time they trace me, I'll be done with my work. Come on! Come on! Suspect is missing! Move! Move! Move! He got away! Nothing. Get some bandages. Hurry up. Brother? Brother? I recognised you as soon as I saw you. Remember, you helped a devotee of Allah and He too will help you. It's not right for you to go out now. The police are looking for you. I have very little time. Someone's life is in danger. Hello? Jai? Where are you? Suhani, we're as bad as them. It was Samarth who killed the mixed couples not Russell. He has taken Nicole somewhere. I'll have to find him. Jai! - your sister's operation had devastated him. - Jai. Get out of there.. - Jai, listen to me! Samarth knew that if he had gone ahead with the operation.. ..Sheena would die. - What? And so did I, but there was nothing I could do. 'Suhani, please talk to him.' 'Suhani, you stay out of this.' 'Go inside! Stay there. Or I'll kill you.' 'Suhani.. - Shut up! - Please brother.' 'Get inside! - Brother, please.' 'Brother, I don't want to die. - Everything will be all right.' 'It's too late. This abortion can kill her. - Please.' 'We'll have to go ahead with the abortion.' 'We have to abort this baby.' I guess that's why I've always tried.. ..to bring Australians and Indians together. Because if they were, then Sheena might have.. Brother would have accepted her. you were right. I was being a hypocrite.. ..I couldn't stand up for my sister. Suhani. Jai, you'll have to save Nicole. you have to stop my brother. I couldn't save my sister.. ..but if something happened to Nicole.. ..then I'll never forgive myself. Suhani, listen to me. Just get out of that place right now. Suhani! Suhani, I'm coming there. Knock! Knock! Who's there? It's your friend Russell. I'm okay. Get her out! Suhani, just get out of there. I'm fine, Jai. Just go. Suhani! I know you're in there. I'm coming. Suhani, I'm coming there. I'm fine. Go save Nicole. Don't worry about me. This violence will end only if we help them. This is the only way this is going to end. Suhani. I know where brother has taken her. Warren Street. Sheena's abortion took place there. Do this for me please. Jai, I.. I love you. Suhani, I.. Suhani! Save Nicole save the city. Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me. Please. - Suhani! Please. ''When I had you I lost you.'' ''My heart cries without tears.'' ''Why did my dreams come so close and disappear?'' ''It's impossible to live without you.'' ''There's sadness in my heart.'' ''Where can I go now without you?'' ''I constantly get your support.'' ''I live in your arms.'' ''Where can I go now without you?'' Keep digging, Romi. Let Nicole go, Samarth. Have you gone blind? Romi and I, we are your own. Not Nicole. They're murderers. you want to get every Indian killed here, Samarth? If something happens to Nicole this entire city will burn. Let it burn! What about my sister who was killed by Russell? you killed your sister not Russell! No. No. Had you not had any problem with their relationship.. ..you wouldn't have to see this day. Russell killed Sheena. you talk about culture and tradition, Samarth? This is what you're doing for your country? Look inside of you. you're running away from yourself. you're the racist not just them. you couldn't even see the love your sister had. Romi, continue digging. Don't listen to him. He's gone mad. They're the bad ones. We're the good ones. And in this fight, the good will triumph. So just help me win. The line dividing good and bad.. ..comes straight thru the heart, Samarth. We all have virtues and vices. But the one who has the courage to see the vices in himself.. ..he is truly human, Samarth. I'm right and they are wrong. you want to kill me, right? Come on. Come on kill me. My death will not end this. If I kill one man like you, I don't know how many will be born. I can kill you, but I can't get rid of your diseased thoughts. The solution is that you stay alive, not die. you'll have to live. Knowing that you're solely responsible for your sisters' death. Recognise the vices within you, Samarth Recognise the vices within you. I'm right! I know they're the bad ones! They're the bad one! you were wrong. We were bad. Romi! No, Romi. - you were wrong! We were bad! There were not bad. - Romi, don't! We were bad! We were bad! - Romi! Not them! We were bad. you were wrong! you were wrong! ''The lord has had mercy on me.'' ''All this has happened because of you.'' ''I finally feel alive here with you.'' ''On your shoulder every moment lasts.'' ''I hope this goes on forever.'' ''Where can I go now without you?'' 'Who claims that the era of magic has become extinct?' 'We saw today a magical sight before us..' '..never seen before on the streets of Melbourne.' 'The Australians and Indians have finally come together to..' '..support one common cause..' '..ending racism and protecting students together.' 'This growing tension between Australians and Indians..' '..was eradicated when an Indian who came to Melbourne..' '..on a fake passport landed up..' '..risking his life to save an Australian girl.' 'Suraj alias Jai Dixit has won the hearts of Australians.'
