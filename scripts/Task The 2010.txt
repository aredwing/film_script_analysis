Here, let me just help you out here. These, too? Okay, here, let me get that for you. Thanks. Yeah. Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Come on, boy! Connie. Bob. What you're proposing, Connie, is, to say the very least, extreme. Very extreme. I agree, Bob, but in this particular case, I truly believe we have to do whatever it takes. Come on! Come on! Okay! Okay! Come on! Come on! Move, move, move! What are you doing? Get off me. Please. I don't wanna die. We all gotta go sometime, huh? Four months ago, each of you little piggies attended auditions to be on a never-before-seen reality TV game show. And guess what? You won. Hey. Rhonda Shoemaker. I think, in life, some people are meant to be on TV, and I'm one of them. My favorite color is yellow, like the sun. Hi, I'm Randall, and I'm totally off-the-hook gay and proud of it. You're a cutie, aren't you? My favorite book is Ok! Magazine. Hi, I'm Toni, and I have the IQ of Einstein and Stephen Hawking, put together. I wanna lead our country. Next question. My name is Angel, on loan from England. Me, too. He's my brother Stanton/parole officer. Hello. When Stanton and I were two, our mother dropped him on his head. And he doesn't know. Well, but I do. Dixon, 6'2", 200 pounds. You know, people used to say I look like Will Smith. Now they say Barack Obama. Okay. The name of the show is The Task, and the premise is simple. To win $20,000 each, all you have to do is spend one night in a prison. That abandoned prison. Whoa. Holy shit! Cool. How come I've never heard of this show? Like, how do we know this is not some sort of frat house prank? Right. This is actually our third show, but we won't be on-air until the fall. And as for knowing if this is anything more than a college prank, you'll just have to play for the money to find out. You'll be asked to perform a series of tasks. Tasks that will test your nerves, your courage and your sanity. Sounds like fun, right? What kind of task are we talking about, dawg? That I can't tell you. You either accept the challenge or not. Feel free to take the easy way out, by jumping into this yellow taxi cab, yes, the pun is intentional, and going home. Make your decision now. I'm in. What, you kidding me? I'll pay you to let me do this. Where do I sign? Shit! I can't have no girl do this while I take off. My boys will rob my ass to the grave. I'm in. I have to look after my baby sister. I'm in. You guys are insane. Do any of you know the history of that prison? Some really fucked up shit went down in there. He's right. Some truly disturbing events took place on the other side of those walls. Like what? Stick around. You'll find out. The total money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if all of you make it through the night, there will be a substantial bonus. So the team counts. Ain't enough money in the world to make me stay in that place. So, you're out? Way out. Anybody else wanna join him? Not me. Well, there's no way I'm riding all the way back to the city with urine boy. Oh, I'm in. Just get me the hell out of here. Your chariot awaits. Unlock him. Bye. You guys are idiots. This is for some fucking frat party joke and you're all gonna be made fun of. You're all gonna look like a bunch of losers. Can't you just see this video playing at a party? Or we get famous. Jesus! There's a freaking human head in there! Don't worry, it's not real. Sure as hell looks real to me. What we in the business like to call a "special effect. " Pretty cool, huh? A little taste of what's waiting for you in there. Thanks to our award-winning special effects team. Follow me, my friends. In the warm, swampy water, lazy crocodiles wait for the next meal. The Indian crocodiles have long, pointed faces. These crocodiles are called... Boys. I see you're working hard as usual. Are we ready? Totally ready. Totally and absolutely. Good. Let's keep it that way. Yes, ma'am. Hey. And the award for "Best Performance in a Reality TV Show" goes to me. Thank you. Thank you so much. Great job selling the fear out there, man. Yeah. I can't believe any of those kids stuck around for the show. You actually looked like you were terrified out there. Well, that's because I am. I mean, first of all, just looking at that place totally creeps me out. And second, I have a cousin that lives near here, and he told me that, like, disappeared in there. Did you know about that? About the dead homeless people? Sure. Why didn't you say anything? Some homeless people died. Big deal. That's kind of a lot of people for a coincidence. I mean, do you really think it's safe in there? Safe enough to get the show insured. Any more questions? Yeah. How do you sleep at night? Like a baby. Let's do this. Okay. We are filming. All of you have chosen, of your own free will, to spend the night in this prison for the chance to win $20,000 each. Pretty straight forward, right? Okay, then let's get this party started. You'll find everything you need in your base camp, which is located in the Warden's office. Where's that? Well, it's kind of complicated. Maybe one of you should write it down. But you took away all of our possessions, so how are we supposed to write it down? Oh, darn. Then I guess you just have to remember everything I say. Go straight down the hall, hang a right, another right, then a left. Then straight on up the first flight of stairs, a left, a right, then one more left. You want me to say it again? Yeah. Too bad. When you get there, you'll find the key to release you from those shackles. Is there anyone else inside? Mmm. Smart question. We'll just have to wait and see. I thought coming out of the closet was scary. Have fun, inmates. Good luck. Where's she going? Welcome to The Task. Can you please not do that? I can't see a damn thing in here. Okay. Does anybody remember which way he said to go? It's straight, a right, then a left. No, it's straight, two rights then a left. Too many "straights. " No, it's, "Go straight down the hall, "hang a right, another right, a left. "Then straight on up the first flight of stairs, "a left, a right, and one more left. " What are you? Hmm. She's smart. Hmm. Bob has found us some really great contestants here. Guys, we're gonna have a great show. Careful. Careful. Jesus. What is this place? Okay, and get ready. That was fun. Shut up! And speed them up. Yes, my queen. Guys... Dogs! Hey, hey! Go, go, go! Come on! Come on! Go, go, go! Now go! Left turn. Why am I not seeing anything? Shit, shit, shit, shit. Well, I don't know. The power's going down, but the backup should've kicked in by now. Shit! Hurry! It's a weird glitch, huh? Careful! Left! Here we are. Cool. We're here. Damn, it's cold in here. Look, key. Hell yeah. Okay. Hey, guys, look. Yeah, come on. Cool. All right, you. Who's that? I guess it's the Warden. Get this one. Yeah, my turn. Okay, yeah. Wow. Cool map. Hey, check this out. What you got, man? "Greetings, brave contestants. "That would be me. "Welcome to Warden Clem Harvis' personal office. "In the center of the room is a box. "You are to take turns reaching in the box "to retrieve a single chess piece. "This chess piece will determine your own personal symbol. "You cannot trade with any of the other contestants. "Legend has it that the Warden used to put "a little surprise in the box. "Razor blades were a personal favorite. " Okay, now that's... That's sick, man. "Now, it's your turn to put your hand in the box. " Shit. So, who wants to go first? Me. What the hell is going on? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I mean, I don't know. I didn't put anything in the box. Just the chess pieces. Seriously? You should have seen all of your faces. She's funny, man. Not cool, man. Not cool. Silly bitch. Not cool. Bishop. Yeah. Black king. Black rook. White knight. White queen. Hey, look. Aw! Holy shit! Okay, that is really fucking creepy. Welcome, my little piggies, to The Task. Now, for a little history of Pennyville State Prison. In 1931, with the climbing budgets during the Depression, the cold blooded Warden thought he could keep his fortune on track by eliminating certain overhead costs. His inmates! Eventually the Warden was exposed, but not before having executed 85 inmates! The last person to be served a death sentence here was Warden Harvis himself. To this day, it is on record that his last words were, "My work here is not yet done!" Rumor has it that the Warden still roams the halls. Tonight, you will be asked to go face to face with the Warden, and the tortured souls that still inhabit the building you are now in. Task one. White Queen. Try not to die! Does anybody want to trade? Hell no! Well, I don't get it. What's my task? Okay. "The White Queen will got to the prison chapel to complete his task. "The other contestants will instruct him how to get there, "by using the radio headsets "and the map found on the wall "in the Warden's office. "Once there, you'll receive further instructions. " My greatest fear would have to be... Anything to do with all things religious. Okay. Can you hear me? Yeah, where are you? Still in the first hallway. Okay. It says to go straight and take the first opening on your left. Nice job with the sound. Hey, thanks. Oh, shit. What? They turned my torch off. I can't see a damn thing. Okay, take it easy, Randall. Now, make a right and go straight. There's babies hanging! Children's... I imagine they have the place wired for audio input. Audio being more profound in tapping into our primal fears than sight. Is that right? Yeah. Okay. "Continue forward and there should be "a corridor off to your right. "Pennyville Chapel's located in the same wing "as the death row jail cells. "It is in this chapel that many convicts would visit, "as they made their way down "to their final moments in the gas chamber. "It is also the place where Warden Harvis had many prisoners tortured "just before putting them to death. " God! Sounds like a real sweetie. No, I'm good, man. "The task at hand is to get to the chapel "and light a candle for the souls who died there. " Freaking stoner. "Continue forward "and there should be a large wooden door to your right. " Did you hear that? What? I don't know. It was a sound. Okay, I... I think someone's in the room with me. They're using speakers, Randall. Seriously. Okay. Oh, my... Ooh. Nice set. Okay, I'm at the altar, but I don't see anything to light the candle with. Okay, never mind. Now what? They want you to turn off your flash light. Oh. No way. There's no way in hell that I'm turning off... Okay, now what? "Open the Bible to the marked page "where you'll find the Lord's Prayer. "Having been desecrated 75 years ago, "this once holy place is a likely hotspot of paranormal activity. " Yeah, okay. I got it. "You are to call upon the dark spirit of the Warden Harvis "by reading the Lord's prayer... " Oh, my. "In reverse. " No way. Oh, hell no, man. Don't do that shit. Uh-uh. I can't... I can't do that. That's total Satan stuff. I can't... "Once your task is completed "if there is no sign of the Warden, "you can return to base camp. " Just... Just read it and come back. Yeah. Deep breath, Randall. Just do it. Please forgive me, whoever I may be pissing off. This wasn't my idea. Okay. "Evil from us deliver "Our Father who art in heaven... "but temptation into not us lead. "... Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. "On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day... "And us against trespass "who those forgive we as trespasses our us forgive. "And bread daily our day this us give. "Heaven in is it "as earth on done be will thy, "come Kingdom thy. Name thy be hallowed. "Heaven in art who Father our. " Please say I can leave now. "Before you head to the base camp... " God, Randall, you have to blow out the candle. Bloody hell. You're joking, right? And sit there for one minute. The things I do for money. Where'd he go? It would be my estimation that the production has cut off our ability to communicate with our homosexual friend in order to create a more terrifying atmosphere. Whatever. Hey. We're just finishing up the first task. Sure, like clockwork. Guys? I think we got some really good stuff. Yeah. You, too. Guys? Guys? Guys! Randall? Oh. Hey. Do you see anyone? No. Okay, task completed. Return to base. If I knew ahead of time that it was gonna be that scary, I would never have done it. Come on, dude, it couldn't have been that bad. Totally not worth the money. But having done it, it was totally worth the money. Oh, thank God I'm finished. Look at me, I'm still shaking. I don't think I could handle doing it again. You never know. They might ask you to do another one. Don't joke. I swear you can feel some kind of twisted vibe out there. It's like walking through heavy fog, only it's ice cold. It was creepy. Is it me, or is it getting colder in here? Yeah, she's right. I want to go next. What exactly do you mean, "There are some cameras down"? What do you want me to say? I'm sorry, but this is pretty complicated stuff. We'll get Scelzi to go down and have a look and fix them. Unbelievable. Get it done and pause the game. Scelzi. Scelzi? Can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah, I need you to go down and have a look at some cameras. Yeah. Boys. Too late. We need to talk. I'm busy. Well, we talk now or I walk. You know that the success of this show is very, very important to me, right? It's important to me too, Taylor. Okay, good. So why are you trying to sabotage it, hmm? What do you mean? Well, I've been doing a little research. And by "research," what you actually mean is you've been fucking one of the local girls. Am I right? Loose lips sink ships, Taylor. Yeah, well, you know what she told me? Okay, this prison didn't just have a men's wing, all right? It had a women's wing, too, all right? And the twisted fucking Warden would roam around it, naked, answering to no one. He beat them, he raped them, made them have his children, then he starved them to death. People say he even fed some of them their own babies. What's your point? My point? My point is that the real story would have made the show a hit! Everybody would've been talking about us. The story you cranked out is nothing compared to the real one. I agree. So why didn't we use it? Because the town said they'd sue us if we did. They did? Yeah. Oh. Right. Are we done here? Yeah. No, wait. No. Wait, wait, wait. No, there is... There is one more very important thing I need to discuss with you. Oh, yeah? What's that? The girl I slept with, I think she gave me crabs. Anyway, I'm gonna go take a nap. They on? Yep, they're on. Sweet. Scelzi, what was that? Just a little something to get me through the night. Do you want? No, I do not want. Just get your hairy butt back here, okay? Aye, aye, captain. Hello? You scared the shit out of me. You seem a little tense, man. You wanna get high? I've got some good stuff. Suit yourself. How we doing? Fixed? Great. Just great. We are totally ready to go. Test two. Bishop! I would have to say my biggest fear would be being buried alive. Where do I go next? Okay, "Go right at the end of the hallway. "This will lead you to Freedom Row. " All right, I'm at the end of Freedom Row. What do I do next? Tell him to go right again. Go straight on and then right. Straight and right. Got it. Oh, shit! What? What is it? I don't know, something just dripped on my forehead. What? Blood. Oh. It's not real blood. Yeah. No shit, Sherlock. I love that girl. Okay, do you see a door to a staircase somewhere on your left? Oh, man, please tell me I get to go up and not down. Sorry. "Down one floor to the lowest level "in the entire prison complex. "The level you are going to "is known amongst inmates as Suicide Row. " Shit, man! Hold me back, hold me back. Okay, take approximately 80 paces. Eighty paces? Who do I look like, a pirate? You should see a metal door once you've gone a flight down. Okay. Yeah, I see it. It says... Damn. "Welcome to solitary confinement, cell number five. "Solitary confinement was the most feared cell block "in the entire facility. "For the violent and frequently insane, "cell number five was the biggest contributor "to the cell block's death toll. " Shit. What? What happened? No, nothing happened. This place literally smells like shit. Look, just tell me what I need to do so I can get the hell out of here. Okay, do you see a boiler suit? Yeah. Yeah, I see it. Right, put it on. No! Ooh. Cool bugs. Thanks. You guys ever get tired of complimenting each other? I don't. Do you? Um... No. The things I do. Okay, I got it on now. It says, "If an inmate failed in his suicide attempt, "he'd be further punished "by being placed in the hole. " "You are to now re-enact the torture of a prisoner. " Okay, so where is it? Under your feet. Oh, come on! You gotta be kidding me. I mean, this thing is, like, full of shit in here. Money, money, money. That's a pretty harsh task. "Once in the hole, you are to await further instructions. " Okay. Hello? Hello? Shit. They've cut us off again. Hey, no offense, but I really hope you're not my task. Connie. What? Take a look at this. What is it, Snow? Just tell me. No. Come look. What? What the... Who is that? That isn't... You're fired. Why? You go behind my back and you hire some extra to be in the show when I specifically told you not to, and you wanna know why you're fired? That's not my guy. Well, that's weird. He just disappeared. Where'd he go? Who the fuck was that? I don't know. Don't look at me. Look, Connie, you've got to get that guy out of there, all right? I mean, this is gonna screw up the show. Damn. This is gonna kill us. You're sure this isn't just you screwing around? Scout's honor. Why are you laughing? This isn't funny. It's so obvious. What is so obvious? Come closer. Remember when I asked you why you were having Snow rig cameras in the control booth? Yeah. The network wanted some guys in there to shoot some behind-the-scenes... Fuck me! Fuck me! You're right. It's kind of genius, isn't it? It's total genius. What are you two talking about? We're part of the game. What? You mean to tell me that the network is throwing some twists into the game just to see how freaked out we get? Bingo! So what do we do now? Go on with the show. As planned. Task three. Black King and White Knight. Task four. Black Rook and White Queen. Double trouble. I like it. Told you you might have to do another task. Smartass. Okay, Black King and White Knight are to turn right and make their way to the gas chamber. White Queen and Black Rook are to go straight and head to the prison kitchen. Okay, laters. Good luck. My greatest fear would be being left alone. "King and Knight go left and then right. "Rook and the Queen go to the end of the hall "and take the stairwell down. " Scelzi, pick up. I need to talk to you. Scelzi, are you there? Can you hear me? Come on, pick up. We're in. "Welcome to the gathering room. "The windows in front of you have been the viewing area "where hundreds of citizens "witnessed dozens of condemned men "breathe their last breaths. "If the condemned wished, "this is where he would receive his last rights. " You should see a light switch at the rear wall. "If you're being put to death "during the reign of Warden Harvis, "you might also find him enjoying his evening meal here, "calling it 'Dinner and a show. '" "Black King and White Knight are to enter the gas chamber. " Again, nice set, Connie. Can't take credit for that, it's the real deal. Only thing the legal department could clear. Cool, right? Well, it's scary all right. Christ! What's that smell? It is a well documented fact that execution chambers frequently have the smell of death in them. Of course the smell isn't actually death. When a human knows his or her life is about to come to an end, it will tend to reach an anxiety level that will cause it to emit highly noxious odors. In this particular case, we're smelling a combination of human smells and the smells of the gas used to kill said human. Now for the fun part, boys and girls. Black King gets to sit down in the gas chair. Black King? That would be me. And await further instructions. "White Queen and Black Rook are to make their way "to the rear of the dining hall. "There you'll find some meat and a pan. "This is to be cooked and eaten. " Oh, man! Great. I'm starving. "Inmates were always suspicious that meat supplied "was not cow, pig or lamb, "but something else. "Something sweet and nothing like anyone had ever tasted before. " So, we're talking human flesh, right? You in? Yes. Guess what you get to do now? I give up. You get to strap Toni in. I'm paraphrasing here, but Toni should fully comprehend the fear the victims felt when they were about to be gassed. You're good at that. Let's just say, some of my girlfriends have been on the kinky side. Okay, she's all strapped in. What now? Okay, you have to exit the chamber and seal it. Oh. Is that okay with you? Mmm-hmm. What are you doing? Just in case. Okay. "Your task is to shut off the master valve "before the gas terminates your teammate. " You need to follow the pipes. Makes sense. Okay, got it. My greatest fear? Well, I'm vegetarian, so I guess eating meat. Guys. Guys? Guys. Taking bets? I will bet 100 on her throwing up. Done. Hmm. Not bad. Mmm. Sweet. It's weird. I can't do this. I can't. It's my worst nightmare. Come on, sweetie, that's the show. Just think, "No more college debt. " Look, remember what he said? "If the team wins, there'll be a substantial bonus. " Do it for the team, girlfriend. Wow. You gonna hurl? Thank you. Okay, Angel, I'm at the bottom of the stairs. Shit! What? What is it? Oh. Nothing. It's just more of that fake blood. Do you hear me? He's back. This really stinks. Let me out. Hey, come on. Hey, let me out, man. This really stinks. For real. My God! Who is that man standing there? Topless. So manly. Let me out. I don't know, Con. This guy is actually starting to creep me out. Yeah. You and me both. Hey. Hey, come back! Hey, stop playing. Let me out. So, what's up? Taylor. I need to talk with you. Outside? Sure. Big news. I think the company's playing us. What? Who's there? Who are you? Show me the chamber. Sorry. The smoke's too thick. Shall we cover Rook and Queen? Where are they? I don't know, but just give me one second. Yup, Connie. Here, I got them. There. There's that guy again, see? Wow. Who the hell is that? Okay, how'd he get there so quick? That's the guy from the painting, right? Yeah. Yeah, it looks like him. Cool. No, not cool. He either walks through walls, or there are more than one of them. We all seen The Prestige, right? Do you mind if we pass? Please? Guys? Guys? Fake blood pack, fake shiv. Nice. Nicely done. In fact, maybe even Oscar worthy. No. No, that's not right. This is way, way off script. It looked real to me. Connie, they are playing us. Trust me. Warden Harvis, meet Connie Solomon. What? Look. They copied the picture. What? Casting. Costume. Easy. Hold on. No. No. No! You're right. He's a real ghost. Can't get any more off than that. Shit! That's Stanton he's carrying. He goes any further with him, he's gonna take him off my grid. What? Look, it's a huge prison. I mean, I couldn't put my cameras everywhere. Show me the hole. Show me the chamber. Taylor, somebody's gotta go in there and see if they're okay. I can tell you, they don't look okay. She's acting, acting, acting. Where is Scelzi then? I don't know. Probably off his face somewhere. No. No, something is not right here. I'm gonna call the office. Bob. Hi. Yeah, it's me. Look, I need to ask you, have you thrown in any surprises on this one? Any... No. Okay. Yeah, you too. Good night. They say they've got no idea what's going on here. BS. Still feels wrong. Okay, I'll go and prove it to you. No problemo. Anyone coming? Yeah, I'll go. I'll grab a camera and get some cool footage. Thank you. All right. Yeah. Again. Task five. Black Pawn. Your destination is cell seven. Lucky. You must be nice to them. Easy peasy lemon squeezy! "Easy peasy lemon squeezy. " Let me out! Hey, this ain't fun no more. Hey, you know what? You're actually kind of photogenic. Yeah, so funny, pretty boy. Hey. You. It's freezing in here. I want to do my task. Kill the air-con. What? I turned it off Come on. Connie, what do you wanna do? Hold the game. Wow, this place is kind of spooky, right? Yeah. You should try rigging our shit in here on your own. It gets a bit weird. Look, look. That guy. The extra? Where? Hey. Where'd he go? I don't know. I didn't see him. He went right past here. Dead end. What was that? Yeah, what was that? Shit. No! Taylor? Put Angel on screen. We need to get those kids out of there. Can you hear me? Yeah. Hi. Yeah. Good. Listen up. There's been a slight change of plans. We're gonna need to stop the show. What? Why? I'm gonna be honest with you. There is somebody in there with you. Who? We're not sure. But I need you to get yourself out of there as fast as possible, understood? You're playing me? You're trying to freak me out. It's genius. Pure genius. It's great. It's gonna be a hit show. Yeah. No, please. Angel. My name is Connie Solomon, I'm the producer of this show, and I am telling you to get the hell out of there. Open the door. I want to win and I want my money. So open the door! Who opened the door? Sorry, you're not serious, are you? Idiot. Oh, shit! Sorry, I thought you were playing to the cameras. You're task is to memorize and locate the clearly marked cell seven. Lucky! In this cell, Warden Harvis received a near fatal stab wound from an inmate. You'll find a key in that cell, and this key can release both your inmate colleagues from the hole and the gas chamber. Cool. Is that all you got for me? Easiest money I've ever made. What am I afraid of? Nothing. Angel! Stanton? Anyone? Anyone? Help! Bollocks. Great, now she's gone off my grid. Hello? Who's there? Hello? Angel? Angel. Where are you? Help! Hey. Put me down. Put me down. Who are you? Angel? Angel! What... This isn't right. Put me down. Hold on. It's you. No! There you are. What the... Angel, are you okay? He killed my brother. He's gonna kill me. He killed my brother. Go. Run! And the winner of The Task is Connie Solomon. New Jersey School of Acting. Not bad for a straight guy, right? Huh. You all are complete and total... Might I add, very clever assholes! Hey, congratulations. You're gonna be on TV. This is for you. It's Bob. Connie, you there? Yeah, just about. How in the hell did you organize all of this? With great difficulty. It's gonna make a great show. I will deal with you later. I'm gonna de-rig some of my shit first, okay? Okay, sure. You really are an asshole. You said you wanted a great show, didn't you? Well, you got it. Yeah. Oh. What about the others? You go wrap Toni, I'll get Dixon and Stanton. Okay, Snow, that's a wrap. Hey, guys, you all go get cleaned up and change. Let's get ready for the wrap party and some champagne. Oh. Great acting work. Show's over. Toni? Good job, Dixon. Okay, Dixon. That's a wrap, buddy. You okay? Quit dicking around, Snow. Hey, you got anything to say? We have to get them out of there. No, give it to the camera. To the camera. We have to get them out of there. Hey, kiddo. Calm down. The show is over. We've wrapped. Give it to the camera. Give it to the camera. Get that out of my face!
