I'll call back tonight. Bye. My name is Jrme Thomas, Sometimes they call me Tom. Or Jerry. Sports journalist. I've come from Paris for the match. Do you want to know anything else? But I haven't asked you anything. Listen girl, you didn't stop watching me throughout the game. True or false? Absolutely true. So we agree. Don't move, I'm off to the dressing room and I'll pick you up. Sit. Not on that. - Do you... - Shh! I'll rid of my article first and we'll talk later. Well, no, I'll do it later. Come and take care of me. What did you mean earlier? Do you... prefer to remove your socks, or to keep them? Let's compromise, remove one of them and leave the other one. - Shall I see you tonight? - No. - Will you be working? - No. - What will you be doing? - I don't know. Good evening, comrade. The truth is I had dinner with friends, Biarritz journalists and players, as usual. After dinner we went for a drink. Around midnight, I was leaving. Well, I'm off to bed, good night. Then the door opened and she entered. Call me a taxi, please. I'll try again in a while, if you want. We'd give you a ride, but we walked here. This is water. More? Come on guys, we've had enough of your pectorals, show us your shoulder blades. It's still not answering. Thank you, sir. Could you come with me, please? Can we take the song along? Can we? Why not? Would you come with me? Where are you going? Is there a train to Paris tonight? It's already left. Do you live in Biarritz? Tonight yes. - Can I come to your place? - Yes yes. It's silly to say yes yes. No, stop laughing. And let's go at once, I can't stay here. It's good you didn't ask why. It's good. She made me take very strong sleeping pills. Very strong, do you understand? Now it doesn't matter, I can sleep. Paula. Paula? Get up, Paula. My plane is in twenty minutes. Why is it called The Sad Cafe? The last night bar? I don't know. - Perhaps a song. - And where is my song? Here. - It will be cold now. - No. Are you leaving with me or staying here? I'm leaving. I dreamed we meet in a bar called The Sad Caf. We looked at each other and I was afraid, it's funny. Can I still stay with you today? Yes. You'll go to my place. I must go straight to the paper. I'll be home tonight. Buy us some dinner. No, I won't go out. Alright. I'll bring things back. - Tonight, I'll tell you. - I'm not curious. But I'm sensitive. My dear Alexandre, yes, I recognized your hypocrite's voice, put me through to my husband. Hello? Hugo, darling, tell me, between which thighs did you spend the night? You call me back when you are not drunk. Yes? You adore my first, you treasure my second, My third is all your life, and my all left. - Paula? - How soon you've guessed, dear. Yesterday night, she took her sleeping pills, I locked her for the night... I don't care about details, come back to Paris. - Are you stopping everything, darling? - No It's already underway. Oh, I forgot, sweetheart Hugo, I'm in Paris, and your darling little daughter too. In the apartment of a handsome young man. Very funny. Address? I'll send Marc and Bruno. You know that in Biarritz I didn't drink a single drop of alcohol. Are you happy, darling? The address, Eve? Be a little patient, Micheli, let me finish my glass. Have you seen my yesterday's article? Agen is undertaking, but rather chaotic and a soft touch. Well, tomorrow I'll need space, I'll get back to these results. If we can. I'm coming. Fourth meeting of the day. See you, kids. STILL NO NEWS OF HUGO MICHELI'S DAUGHTER The theater director requests the police to intensify search. I'll pop over to my place. I'll be back at eight o'clock. Paula? Sorry. Sorry. Anouck? Yes. No. Tonight I'm on duty. No, but you can come here at 3 am, I'll be back. No, no I'm not cold, I'm busy. OK. Excuse me. Thank you for coming round. We are rehearsing. Do you like Guitry? Darling, he is not as old as you, he is far too young to know Guitry. My wife. Mr. Thomas. Have you got a cigarette, Mr. Thomas? My husband took mine. - He thinks I smoke too much. - No. I don't smoke. Albert, I'll be in my office. Follow me. Sit down. I think my two boys told you why I wanted to see you. No. Didn't you ask for an explanation? No, it wasn't worth it, since you'll give it now. At 2 pm my daughter called me to pick her up at your place. When I arrived, the door was open and Paula wasn't there anymore. I left these two boys at your place, and I apologize about it, in case she'd come back. And also to wait for you, I wanted to talk to you. You see, - Paula left the house... - I read the newspapers. When did you last see her? This afternoon, about one o'clock. You had to see her again? She was supposed to wait for me this evening. And when you saw she was no longer there? I accepted it. I don't open the gas whenever a girl stand me up. Where and when did you meet? In Biarritz last night. In Biarritz. And what was she doing in Biarritz? I didn't ask her. It seems to me that you don't trust me. You are wrong. I hardly knew your daughter. She had no reason to confide in me. Hardly, and you install her in your place? I assure you that I often install girls I hardly know in my place. Thank you. I apologise for having disturbed you. Jerk. Bambi? - Is it ready for me? - Yes yes, they are here. Bardot, no, Kosygin no, ah, a ball, that's for me. - Good evening. - Good evening. What is he reading? It's Micheli's daughter who disappeared. She died in a car crash earlier. I'll finish it later on. I'll be back in an hour or two. - Well, what are you doing here? - I knew the girl. - Where is she, have you seen her? - No, I've just arrived. Can we see the girl? They took her away, there wasn't much left to see. Only her papers didn't burn, they were in a metal thing. - The family? - They came, they left. And how did it happen? It's not known yet, but there was an empty bottle of whiskey in the car. The girl must have been drunk, she skid, look at that. It caught fire immediately. Well, tomorrow the experts will sort it out. Thanks. What a face! In love with the deceased? Young man with a heart of stone. No, you idiot, curious, vaguely curious. So my old Schnouffi-fouffi, he is still dragging you around? And how is the old Schnouffi-fouffi? He schnouffes well and fouffes like crazy. He lives his life as a dog, you see. Have you been here for long? You told me 3 pm. An article to finish and been delayed. You look in a terrible mood. If I'm bothering you, I can go. Do what you want, but speaks lower. You haven't even noticed I changed my hair color. I noticed it, but I find it cheap. So I shut up. Come on, your curls are pretty. I'm glad you're here. I didn't want to be alone. Put on a disc, don't talk too much and be very much in love. OK? Yes, bastard. OK. Bastard. Oh, you have Bye Bye Barbara. No, not that one. After all, yes, put it on, and come close. - Where is Dimitri? - At the stone. Nothing new? Trifles. You're rather curious, heart of stone, for a simply curious guy. - Ah, she's not really his daughter. - No. He married the mother when the girl was 13, and when she died, adopted her. The daughter. Paula Micheli was insured 300 million old francs for his adoptive father. Bloody idiots. And you call that an accident? - Excuse me? - I suggest a title. Daddy sabotages scooter to kill girlie and get a big cake. Oh, darling, calm down. What would Micheli do with 300 million, that's just his taxes. - Do you know him well? - No, but he's loaded. - Is that all? - Yes. Who can tell me more? He doesn't yet have as a nice voice as his mother. Is Agla here? Agla, I'd like to talk to you a minute. Why only a minute? Don't shoot the husband, he's nobody. You know my daughter is yours whenever you want, love. You're paid for knowing everybody. I can recognize some of them at night. - Hugo Micheli? - The singer? He is out, out. - No, not the singer. - No? Hugo Micheli, a theater director, but why are you talking about a singer, you're confusing me? Michel... he is loaded, houses, women. His current wife was a model, his first or second one was a star of the Folies Bergres, Yasmine Rosette something... - Why are you stopping? - But that's all. You killed me darling, my head is like a squeezed lemon. Thanks for the lemonade. Don't forget, tomorrow Yes yes. You should talk to Bernard, he's nosing around, he knows a lot. Raphal, news. May I. I met Paula Micheli two days ago. News? Is Raphael there? Then, give me his address. Thanks. And I don't believe she had an accident. Why? They say she was drunk. She didn't have her papers by herself, and they are found in the car. And Micheli... Well, keep me posted, my boy, I like entertainment. - Hi beauty, is Daddy home? - No. - Mom? - Sleeping. - And do you know where he is Daddy? - No pal, I ain't her nanny. Right. So Lily, I heard you are being interviewed? And it's bugging you. They can't believe that a journalist has come to see me. And what are you going to write? An article on the music hall glories. You-re young for a journalist. Look at me, am I not handsome? Well, I'm even smarter. This is my press book. - Were you married? - Yes, with a bastard. I must go back for the change of scene. Don't forget to return it. Why was he a bastard? Silly question, why one is a bastard, you're a bastard. Right. We met here, there. I was the star. And little Micheli got me. I was his first step. But when one wants to get to the top of the stairs, the first step is not useful for a long time. I was useful one year. Don't forget to return my press book. She swallowed I don't know how many tubes of whatever - and she jumped into her pool. - Empty or full? Jerry, my love. Birth in the morning, death at night. God gives, God takes back. Got a light? Excuse me, I need to see Raphael. So long, Baby. Jrme Thomas. The paper told me I'd find you here. - Yes. - Can I see you a minute? Now you don't have time, just a word. - Do you know Hugo Micheli? - Yes. Well? Listen, I'm the only one who knows he killed his mother when he was 3. - Perfect. - Good. I have a friend at the vice squad, Eterlou, I'll call him and we'll meet in 2 hours. You'll see, he's even brighter than me. He can show you pictures of little Hugo killing his mother. I don't like rugby, what about you? - I do. - That's him. Eterlou. Jrme Thomas. How did he make his fortune? Simple. Either he's very honest, or he's very clever. Because I've never heard anything wrong about him He put on a few plays that were big successes He even wrote one. Not bad. A comedy. A theater. You've also mentioned a club. Is there no racket in that kind of business? There is, but if he had had problems, we would have known. Recent problems? A deal that went wrong? Hundred kilos of cocaine he bought thinking it was flour and he had a hard time to sell it? Easy. When you are 6 months late in your payments, you better avoid rough gestures, Mr. Micheli. I avoid what I feel like, again, I'll fix the accounts. And again, our condolences, for the misfortune that has fallen on you, so opportunely, dear Mr. Micheli. - He went home. - Report. - Yes? - Mr. Thomas? Yes. Hold on, Mr. Micheli wants to talk to you. Hey, the boss. - Mr. Thomas? - Who's speaking? Hugo Micheli. Hold on, I'll see if Mr. Thomas is there. Hello? Jrme Thomas. - Good evening Mr. Thomas. - Who's speaking? - Hugo Micheli. - Good evening Mr. Micheli. - You like joking, Mr. Thomas. - I like joking, Mr. Micheli. Can I ask you to come and see me, Mr. Thomas, at this address... Jrme Thomas. Do you like playing, Mr. Thomas? Yes, rugby, when I have time. I don't understand, Mr. Thomas, your aggression towards me. I've just lost my daughter whom I loved... I loved. A little bit of humanity, is it really too much to ask? I don't know. I've heard that you went to see my first wife. What did you expect to learn from her? What have you learned? Nothing. I am convinced of it. I am irreproachable, Mr. Thomas. Before men at least. Before the gods, if they exist, it's their business, not yours, I think. Must one be a club member to play? - Have you listened to me, Mr. Thomas? - Yes yes. And you have nothing to say? Do you like rugby? I actually like rugby. Do you know what's on Sunday? Narbonne - Dax in the final at Colombes. Right. I've just thought that I'll have many interviews, many articles to write and basically that whole business is not mine. Now I'd like to buy a few chips, and play a little, if possible. No, please, you are my guest. One hundred thousand in chips for the gentleman. Good luck. Dimitri asked that you come and see him. Alright. You wanted to see me, Marguerite? Yes, Micheli's daughter case is settled, the experts concluded accident. And you, anything new? Back to our seats. - No regrets? - With regrets. But nowadays, comrade, regrets pass so quickly... No time to be romantic and find out why a girl died. There are so many alive, you have to hurry pinching their bums before they slip through your fingers. Hi. Have you seen what happened under the scrum before the last kick? No, it was very confusing. Well, never mind. Can the camera go back a little to the left, it's important. Stop. Where is it in the stand? Jeannot, where is it? A little to the left of the press stand, downwards. Thanks. Mr. Thomas? - Mr. Thomas? - Yes. I was given this for you. - A woman? - Yes yes. You're watched. I left. Do you remember me? Meet me at 9 pm, Quai de la Charente, "Chez Jeanne. " You'll be followed. Come alone. Good evening. So, do you remember me, Mr. Thomas? - Vaguely. - Vaguely? Eve. There is a bottle there, help yourself. And help me. Jrme. It's empty. There's another one in the sink. I was very early. - Have you being followed? - Yes. - Not so far, I hope? - Not so far. My husband has you followed. He thinks I love you, he wants to know if I still see you. He is jealous, poor fool. Who did you expect to see in this room tonight? A woman. Perhaps a man certainly not an elephant. Unless he dictated the letter. Sit on the floor, it tires me up to look up. Hugo may have reasons to be jealous. Can I touch? Tell me about Paula. Don't expect me to talk about that bitch. My glass is empty. I need you. You don't know who she was. What was life between the two of them, she and Hugo. Hugo is someone scaring, you know. You have to help me. Keep it for me at home. I'll come and get it... I don't know. When I can. It's money that I managed to... to get. I can't tell you more. I didn't come for nothing. Is that all? Let's go. Did they hurt you? Why did you want to see this boy again? Such a long time since I saw you! I missed you so much. My little girl. Where were you, tell me, and what did you do during those days? Shut up, I hate you. - I hate you. - Shut up. When I heard what you did, I wanted to die. Then I wanted to kill you. Then I wanted to go to the police and tell them, you think I'm dead, here I am. Weren't you afraid that I'd do it. No. Who was in the car, Hugo? Do not clutter your head with these trifles. Your closets are filled with new things. And not ugly, I think. Were you her lover? Don't start at once. Not now. Why did you leave Eve in Biarritz? Why did you run away? Why? Why? Why is it you want to breathe when you've been under water for a long time? Because you're suffocating. In Biarritz, I couldn't even open the windows. When I read the newspapers, I understood. Why you'd shut me up there. Why I should disappear. And what have you done since you left Biarritz? I subscribed to a library. And I've read all the novels you forbade me to read because you were afraid I'd fall in love with the hero. I saw films too, with all these actors you prevented me from seeing. I talked to people in the street. I breathed, Hugo. I can never live again without breathing, never. I don't want to be a flower-woman or a fruit-woman. - I want... - What? I don't know. I filed an application for divorce. As soon as I get the money, we leave, you and me, to Mexico. To the seaside, you love sea and sun. Until we leave you'll stay hidden. But there... There? There, as you're believed to be dead, I can marry you. My darling little girl. I'll make children with you, my love, they'll look like you. I can't live without you. I won't allow you to live without me. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Shut up. Are you still here? Have I scared you? You're always scaring me. Sometimes I feel like you're going to kill me. That's what you like, huh? Little saint. Yes. - What time is it? - Does it matter? It does matter since I want to know. My watch is in my room. I'll call the speaking clock. Odon... Yes? Hello? He didn't understand a thing, call. You make me do what you want, lovely lady, even nonsense. The smile that passed quickly on your lips... what was that for? For whom? For him? Yes? Mr. Thomas, do you take him? Yes? Hello? Hello? It's gay at your place, daddy Mik-eli. There is mus-ik. It is 4 am, Mr. Thomas. Did you like the game, daddy Mik? You're drunk. Goodnight Mr. Thomas. I don't know how he knows it, but he knows you're here, little fool. Paula, get dressed. Bambi, take her bags and accompany her to her room. Do you want me to unpack your clothes? I don't care. What are you waiting for? Go and turn on the heater, idiot. Bambi, open. And he tells us he has money troubles. Saint-Laurent. Courrges. Saint-Laurent. And that's new as well. Let me see, I'll try it on. Bambi... Very nice. No wonder that her father loves her. You'll hold her, my Bambi. Don't touch me! Hold her tight, I know you enjoy it. You've been waiting for it for a long time, haven't you, Bambi? And I've been longing for something else, my dear little Paula. You know you're a little slut, little slut. You're drunk. You won't have Hugo, can you hear me, I won't divorce. - Can you hear me, little pervert? - Yes, I do. My dear, I don't care you divorce or not. Hugo loved me the day I came, and do you know why he married you? To make me miserable, and he succeeded in it, I gave in to him, I became his mistress. He used you, that was your only use. But now I want to go away, to be free, Hugo prevents me from living. So keep him, if you can. Bambi, do you want her? Take her. It's an order, sweetie. Come on. Where are you going? You know what Mr. Micheli would do to me if I obey you? Get out of here, coward, noodle. And tell Marc I go back to Paris. Nice tires, I had not noticed. Yes, the old ones were really old. So he just changed his tires and he is risking a bullet in the head because he has a crush on a girl. Come on, for old comrade Dimitri, give great pleasure, give up. Maybe da and maybe niet. Thomas, you're expected, here he is, gentlemen. - Inspector Dermot, Inspector Berlier. - Inspector Dermot, Inspector Berlier. Mr. Thomas, please, follow us? - Where to? - To your place. - Splendid, I know the way. - No, you're coming with us, Mr. Thomas. - Sit down. - Thanks. If you're looking for something to drink, it's in the kitchen. - If not, tell me what it is. - Money, lots of money. Then, this is the wrong Jrme or Thomas. What about that? Being accused of blackmailing isn't funny, Mr. Thomas. I think it is, Mr. Superintendent. Come. Look at him, darling, tell us if it's him. It's him. Look at him, Madam, is it really him who extorted you that money? Yes. He knew things that I didn't want my husband to know. Sorry again. And he blackmailed you, little fool? Now you know you can tell me everything, darling. Your turn, Mr. Thomas, what do have to say? Nothing, I wasn't listening. Eve, you are lovely in black. Hello Mr. Micheli. Do you know Mr. Micheli? Do I know you Mr. Micheli? - Not that I know of, sir? - Thomas. Jrme Thomas. Mr. Thomas, the director of your newspaper got from my superiors your bail. The investigation will go on, needless to remind you that you have to stay at our disposal and do not leave Paris under any circumstances. I do everything you want, I've always done it, don't you wonder why? The important thing is that you do it. Because I love you, Hugo. - Do you hear? - Marc also hears. Are you moved, Marc, by this conjugal love? - Good evening sir. - Good evening. The advantage with me is that one always knows where to find me. Look for the bottle, you'll find the woman. What a surprise, Micheli is drinking. Is it you... who hit Paula? And with such a pleasure, darling, if you knew... Why? To make sure she'd get that I won't divorce. You must understand, darling that you'll leave for Mexico with me, not with her. After all I've done for you, I won't let myself be discarded. Think of all the mean things I know about you. I'm tired, Eve. Paula doesn't love me. Not anymore. To divorce, what for? Hugo. You're right. Let's go together to Mexico. Two old friends, tired. Hugo. You know what I'll do? I'll give Paula to that boy. They'll leave France, I'll give them some money. I wish they'll get lost, far away. I wish they'll vanish, let's forget about them. Oh yes. - Come on, let's do it again. - No, get dressed. - Yes? - Jrme, are you terribly mad with me? Who's speaking? Eve, I swear I was forced to play this game. To make you forgive me, I have good news. You will be able to see again someone with blue eyes. Yes? Get dressed. I am at the countryside with her. Come here tonight, I'll explain everything. Not before 11 pm, I have things to settle. - Don't come before 9 pm - Fine. I'm warning you I'll tell friends about it. As you please. It's in Ancy, near Milly. - Once in Ancy... - The easiest way is when he is Ancy... he goes to the tobacconist's, they'll explain him the way. - Good evening. - Good evening sir. Sorry sir, very sorry, here, I'll pay for the cleaning. No, keep it to clean your dog, he got everything. What time is it? A quarter to eleven. I've already seen you somewhere. Haven't you seen him somewhere? You play rugby. Almost. Oh no, I remember, you talk about rugby. Jrme Thomas, here, it's Jrme Thomas. Excuse me pal, I'm in a hurry. - To go to Mr. Miqueli's. - The way? - Yes. - Come, I'll show you. Is there someone here? There is someone. Eve. Dimitri. Dimitri. It's not here. Oh, it's you. There's a lady who gets a lot of visitors, all around the clock, and at least once a night, one rings at my door. - What's going on? - I can't go home. May I? Is the story of blackmail getting at you? I've done better since. Around a quarter to eleven, that journalist, Jrme Thomas, came into my pub in Ancy, on the square. He asked me the way to the villa. A customer even spilled his drink on him. Micheli? No, the weapon wasn't found. Are you arresting Jrme Thomas, Mr. Superintendent? Read tomorrow's newspaper, you'll know it. Undress and get some sleep. We'll talk about it at breakfast. And like an idiot, I do what I'm told. I go into that pub to ask my way, I come across rugby lovers, I almost sign autographs. Mr. Prsident, I've never been to Ancy. I haven't left my room, Mr. Prsident. My friend Miqueli nicely planned his business. Do you hate me? You're right, this place is spooky. A few more days and we'll be happy, you'll see. At the paper they told me you wanted to see me. It's about Thomas. The cops went to his house, his car is there but not him. At the paper, they interviewed everyone, including me. The fool, the damned fool. I've told him a thousand times to drop it. We'll make you eat these insults... Leave me alone, I'm speaking to Mr. You've got spots. - You don't see girls often enough. - Go to hell. Luckily there's still death penalty in France to rid us of idiots. I'll make coffee. Dimitri, are you my friend? No. I can't move. You're going to move for me. - It's me. - Yes? Eterlou can already tell us tonight if some chicks disappeared that week. The girl who died must be missing somewhere. Then, as I had to do a paper about Eve Micheli, I popped at the agency where she worked. I can't tell you much about Eve, I'm not close to all the models of my agency. Talk to Veronica, they were good friends. - Veronica? - You've got your finger on her. Hello. Veronica had just washed her hair, so I helped her to the styling. After her marriage with Micheli, Eve left the agency and I haven't seen her again. Did you stroke her towel at least? Yes, but not for long. Later while she was drying her hair, she showed me picture. Is it Paula Micheli? No, it's Daphn. If only you could see your moist eyes. The scenes of jealousy, another time, Dimitri darling. You're out of your mind. You, rubbish. Go on. In short, I was curious about that resemblance. But Veronica didn't know Daphn very well. Veronica told me that you were a friend of Daphn. Listen chap, I've just turned in, I have a bad headache. ??? will be very short. Nevertheless I managed to make her tell that Daphne had met a guy, the love of her life... Well, it might last or it might not. And they've left last week to South America. On Monday, exactly. On the day of the accident. It's a ticket for a picture of them. They haven't had time to get it, if you're interested... I'm always interested. - Hey, what's going on? - I'll explain as we go along. A little later, I went to fetch the picture, here. They may be gone for South America last week but last night that guy was in a bar in Ancy square, on Micheli's orders. You'll give that picture to Eterlou with the girl's name. If she's really left France, we'll know it, go comrade. Dude, no doubt, no Angelini Daphn has left France on last Monday nor since then. By the way, your modeling agency, do you know what it is? A network of call girls. Give me the address, it can be useful. Then sit down, I'll dictate you a letter. OPEN LETTER TO HUGO MICHELI PAULA IS ALIVE, IT'S DAPHNE WHO'S DEAD isn't it, Mr. Micheli?... Mr. the insurance inspector is losing patience. Leave me alone. Sorry to keep you waiting. We don't doubt the good faith of Mr. Micheli, but we must contact Miss Daphn Angelini in South America. And as well... to make a new assessment of the car and a new examination of the girl but, at the scrap yard... Why didn't you tell me, now it's too late. Here's your car. You should have come 8 days ago. I managed to learn that the car was put through the mill at once. And surely it's not a coincidence. That was the opinion of the insurance inspector too. About the girl, according to the family tradition, she was cremated. - Note... - Enough, shut up. I feel like making love in a field of daffodils, with the sound of a stream flowing in the grass nearby. Come on, one more sip to buck us up. If it doesn't work and they fire me, you'll support me until my death. And I'm warning you, I love breast of chicken and tailored suits. And cigars. Let's go. Yes? Mr. Micheli is away. Wait a moment, I think I can hear him. Inspector Eterlou, sir. Hello Sir, I'd like you to come to the CID, as soon as possible. Is it again about this ridiculous article... Not at all. The Superintendent Amiot put me in charge of asking you for some clarification about that blackmail story. Right. I'll be in your office in an hour. Inspector... Eterlou. Good, I'm waiting for you. Let's go. And you, the trainees, you obey him like me, i.e., you don't. It's more enjoyable to chat with a glass. Alright, I'm coming. Excuse me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Damn, I typed, you're welcome. - Mr. Micheli? - He is not here. Well, we'll wait. Inspectors looking for Mr. Micheli. - Is this Mr. Micheli's office? - Yes. - Are you Mr. Micheli's secretary? - Yes. - Is this Mr. Micheli's safe? - Yes. - Open it. - You're crazy. - Do you refuse? - Certainly. It's normal. I'm really sorry, not long now and I'm yours. - Yes? - That's it, we're attacking. Good. The smoke doesn't bother you, does it? I'll end up resigning. Well. Where were we? Nowhere. Well... - Yes? - You can come. I think it's ringing. Thinking we were almost through, anyway, I'll be right back. Hey, but what is he doing here? That's exactly what I asked him. We'll tell him later what I answered you. Name, Angelini, first name, Daphn, born July 27th, 1948... And died last week. Drafts, bills, mortgages. - No revolver? - No. It would be too good. - Let's not hang around. What else? - That Dimitri, the address of the modeling agency? - Rue Mazarine, 12bis. - Floor? - 3rd. In the last folder I gave you, there is a lease on behalf of Mr. Miqueli for the 3rd floor, 12 bis rue Mazarine. And what's more, your father-in-law is a pimp. Here, it's him coming out. Inspector Eterlou. What's going on? Inspector Darjot. A taxi driver came to the police station saying he left him here. They also warned us, we were faster than you. Let's go. You, go, I'll go with them. And now? They congratulate me. I have nothing to say. I called the superintendent, he's coming. How did it happen? A stroke of luck. I have someone in my office, I'm leaving him to you. I don't smoke. We'll continue another time, I have to go back at once, I kept you waiting for nothing, oh, the bottle fell. Yes, the glasses too. To the theater. Go into the hallway. I bring you good news, all's settled. We'll leave in a while. Everything will change, you'll see. Imagine long beaches the sea guitars, away, and the wind, and Mexicans' hats, lying in the shade on the squares. I can't live without you. Go away. Have you heard? We've already been here, it's the third time... The police, call the police. What are you doing here, Eterlou? An ordinary spectator, Mr. Superintendent. By the way, about Thomas, none of your business, but congratulations anyway. - What is it here? - An 8 mm. Like the one who killed his wife. And what's that? I don't know, Superintendent, I didn't touch anything. You owe me a new briefcase. There are too many people here, see, the little one needs some air. Come here, my boy. Good morning. Look, it's already dark. Work first. I think I caught a cold, Do you mind closing the window? Here. Look what I've found. The Sad Caf. - The name of the bar in Biarritz. - Yes. Paula. Paula. Come and sit here. You smell like an apple. You are an apple. A woman apple. Without that. When you read, I have the feeling that you're leaving. - You want me just to stay here? - Yes. Like that. I'll go for a little walk. What an idea! I won't stay out long. Paula, I'd rather you didn't go out. Well, do what you want.
