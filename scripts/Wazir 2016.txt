One, two... - Buckle my shoe. Very good. Three, four... - Shut the door. Five, six... - Pick up the sticks. Wow! You've learned it all. How about seven, eight... Lay down straight. Nine, ten... Daanish, I'm already late. Don't worry. Thank you. I'll take 2 minutes. Keep the car running. I'll be there soon. Hurry please! Okay. Wait till mom's back... I'll tell her what you're up to. That's okay. Thanks. Hi Daanish. - Sartaj... What's the latest on Rameez? Farooq Rameez? He's in Pakistan. No. He's right in front of me. Connaught Place. Rameez? In Delhi? In a black SUV. Get the license plate. What block? Hello, Daanish? - Hello? Hello, Sartaj? Sartaj, can you hear me? Car entering F block. - Slow down, Papa... you'll ruin my game. Sartaj, hurry up. Noorie's with me. Papa, what's happening? Get down, Noorie! Papa, this belt is stuck... Please open it. Papa... Come on, move! Noorie... Where's the doctor? Where's the doctor on duty? With you, with you With you, with you With you, I live With you, I'll die too With you, with you Ruhana wants to be alone. Come stay with me for a few days. Daanish. Here you go. Get some rest. And... here. These pills... will help you sleep. Yeah, SP We tracked down Rameez's satellite phone. He's still in Delhi. Rameez's exact location? It's some deserted colony The entire sleeper cell is there. Take enough ammo. I'm sending the coordinates. Got it. How's Daanish? Well... He's asleep. He's not great, but he'll get there. Don't tell him about Rameez. He might do something crazy. Don't worry. He's on sleeping pills. Should be asleep for at least 12 hours. We'll see after that. In a shootout between terrorists and the police... Officer Daanish's 4-year-old daughter was killed. The Delhi Police is investigating. Team B, secure the back gate. Remember... We want Rameez alive I repeat, catch the bastard alive. Team A, secure the main body. Block the main gate. Go! Main body secured. Copy. Rooftop secured. Good to go. Sir... Daanish! What's Daanish doing here? What the hell is Daanish doing there? Get him out now. Stop! Stop! Move in now! It's the police! Come in. Team B, move in. Go! Go! Moving in now. Cover that officer. Pull out the car. Quick! Rameez, go. Move! Move! Cover Rameez! Target compromised. Move! Let's go, quick. Get the car! Get in! Go! Go! Look up. Look up! According to our intel Rameez came to Delhi to meet some politician. Now how could we find him? Sir, it was a shootout. If someone shoots at us... we can't just sit back. We have to retaliate. That's exactly what my boys did. Sure, we could've... handled it better... Handled it better? It's a bloody mess. From what I heard... It's all Daanish's fault. Isn't it true? Sir, Daanish's daughter... Suspend him, send him on a medical leave, I don't care. Papa, this belt is stuck... Papa, please help me! Hey! Turn the lights off! Turn the lights off! Hurry up! Late again. Come on in. Your wallet. - Oh, thank God you found it! All morning, Panditji kept asking... if anyone had returned his wallet. Don't just stand there. Come in. Oh Lord, he's so strong... and I'm so weak. O Lord, show me the way. How do I slay that evil King? He's so mighty, and I... Okay, stop, stop, stop. Mr. Pawn, that's too timid! "How do I slay the evil king?" Son, you're seeking revenge, not buying candy! "How do I slay the evil king?" Try it again. With all your heart. How do I slay the evil king? Like that. Once again. - Panditji Yes? This gentleman found your wallet. I've taken money for milk Glasses lying around again! Thank you... You brought my daughter home. This play is in her memory. That's her... Nina, my daughter. Last year, she fell down a staircase... and died. I'm sorry. Forgive me, your daughter's news reached me late. I came there, but... I didn't want to disturb you... So, I left without meeting you. You... knew Noorie? She came to learn chess, with her mom. Ruhana, right? Yes. This is where she came? Just twice. Two classes later, she said, "This is easy!" She'd beat me... always. Before she left, she said "I'll send my Papa over." "Teach him chess." "Poor guy's really weak." See you. Do come again... To play chess with our kids. You'll feel you're playing with your daughter. Like I... play with my daughter. Sir... For you and I, the biggest enemy is time. It just doesn't seem to pass. If we get together over a game of chess, it might. I'm but a fraction You make me whole I owe my life not to heartbeats But to you, my soul Whether you say it or you don't My heart can hear You're with me, my dear You're right here Checkmate! Uncle... checkmate! I'm leaving in three minutes Want to lose one more time? You'll beat me in three minutes? - No. In two. The third minute is to laugh at you. Go on... run along now! This is where everyone gets it wrong, Mr. Daanish. Students come to learn how to win. But first, they must learn how to learn. Watch! Let's take this move back. That's a wrong move. Take it back. I can't. Can't take back the wrong move. There lies the difference between life and chess. There are no second chances in life. In chess, there are. Come on. Your move. Checkmate A game is a game is a game To play to win is a sin Play to learn and you'll win Checkmate. Checkmate. Checkmate. You see this rook... he's a crazy beast. For now, quiet in his corner. But if the pawn in front of him dies... this rook goes on a rampage. What's going on? Lower the window. - Yes? What's wrong? - His horse died. Horse died? Your mind is your only tool Moves that fool are the rule A game is a game is a game Checkmate! A game is a game is a game To play to win is a sin Play to learn and you'll win How was it? - What? How did it feel after killing them? The people who killed your child. Must've felt good. That's how I'll feel when I kill that bastard. Who? Yazaad Qureshi. The Welfare Minister? The "messenger of peace", Yazaad Qureshi. I don't get it. Nina would go to teach his daughter chess. One day, Mr. Qureshi's secretary called... "Panditji, your daughter has been in an accident." Mr. Qureshi said Nina lost her balance... and tripped on the stairs. Maybe he was telling the truth. That day, only I... saw Qureshi's eyes. It was no accident. She was murdered... By Yazaad Qureshi. Yazaad Qureshi's incredible journey began 8 years ago. Terrorists attacked a village of weavers in Kashmir. They killed 55 people of the village. By the time the army arrived... they found only Qureshi and his daughter alive. The whole country admires him. The guy lost everything, yet he said... Guns won't fix anything. Love will. First won hearts. And then... elections Within 8 years, he became the Welfare Minister. What do we know about his daughter? Her name is Ruhi. Age 13. Nina Dhar taught her chess for 2 years. What else? There's nothing else! It's an open and shut case. Nina slipped. Fell down the stairs. Head hit the floor. That's it. Died on the spot. There were 4 eyewitnesses. Qureshi's guys. Let it go, man! The old man's messing with your mind. Did Ruhi see anything? - No. She was in her room. Packing her chess board. But she was at home. Hello. Did you tell the Minister... that I'm here about an investigation? Please hold. I told you your message has been conveyed. Please wait, you'll be called. Good morning. The Minister is waiting for you. - Sir! The appointment is at 4 Thank you. Hello. Sir. You've been called in. Come in. Chief, here's your man. Daanish Ali. I was just telling your chief... to put you back on duty. The terrorist you killed - Rameez... He's the guy who had killed my whole family. Wiped out my entire village. Why are you still standing? Do sit down. Please sit. I'm really thankful to you. How can I help? What's wrong? You had something to ask, right? Don't hesitate. I wanted to ask how Nina Dhar slipped down your stairs. Officer, isn't this file getting closed? Yes, sir. The file is being closed. Don't worry, sir. I'll take care of it. - It's okay. It's alright. Mr. Ali Fate has been unfair to Panditji. First, the fanatics burned down his house in Kashmir. Then, in a car accident, he lost his wife... and both his legs. Last year, his daughter fell down the stairs... Anyone in his situation can lose mental balance. You're his friend, aren't you? Take care of him. And yourself too. And if you need any help, feel free to come to me. I'd be happy to help. You used to weave Cashmere wool, right? For decades. That's delicate work. Yes. For a weaver, your grip is rather strong. I play tennis. If you get time off from Panditji and chess... do join me. We'll play. What do you think of yourself? Sorry, sir. You're suspended. If such antics are repeated... Arrest him. Understand? Understand? - Yes, sir. Sir. I'm but a fraction You make me whole I owe my life not to heartbeats But to you, my soul Whether you say it or you don't My heart can hear You're with me, my dear You're right here How about a game of chess? You were asleep. Sorry, I didn't check the time. Chess is a game of the clock, my friend... but there's no fixed time to play it. Rubbish! Waking an old man at midnight, do you expect poetry? Come. Here you go. Listen to this song. This was my wife Neelima's favorite song. She would play it at every party and say... "Omkar, sing with me." Come beloved... let me take you amidst the stars. Mr. Daanish... presenting... The Omkar Nath Special. These special pieces are used only at parties. So why today? Because we're partying today. Today, you've become my friend. Ask how? How? For the first time today... You didn't call. Just rang the doorbell. At midnight! Now, the rules of this game. If your pawn dies, you take a shot from it! Pick it up. Come on! Let's raise a toast. To our friendship! You know, nothing can beat sitting in a Russian bar... with a Russian woman and drinking Russian vodka! Ever been to Russia? No. Me neither. Make your move, Panditji. Save your Knight. This is getting bad. This reminds me of a poem... There's no escaping the final sleep Then why, in worry, stay awake? So far from myself I stand, I don't feel my own heartache Aah! You knew this one! From Ghalib to Shakespeare, I memorized everything... for Ruhana. I'll work some magic... to win back your queen of hearts Checkmate! You're a quick learner. You won. No. You won. This game was about drinking. Lose pawns, drink vodka! I only lost a couple. But your entire army went down. Now you know the Omkar Nath Special. In this game... you win by losing. Yes? Panditji? We're doing a play my daughter Nina wrote. Your daughter, Noorie, was to play the pawn I'm sure you remember. I hear dancing is your passion If you come and teach dance to the kids... it'll make Noorie and Nina happy. I'm sorry. I can't. Ruhana, there's one more mother here who has lost her child. Her daughter is alive, but has stopped living. What you and I have suffered... Do not inflict that on your mother. Don't kill her daughter. Go, my child. Hi! Maybe you can help me. I'm looking for Nina's friend. Nina told me to look for the quietest girl in the school. She said that's her friend, Ruhi. Do you know the quietest girl in this school? You seem rather quiet yourself. What's your name? Ruhi. Hi, Ruhi. Nina often spoke of you... She said you love to draw. Ever made a drawing of Nina? May I? Wow! When Nina fell down the stairs, where were you? Ruhi, come with me. Ruhi! 10-minute break. You blame Daanish for Noorie's accident. He blames himself too. When I visited your child's grave, I saw him there. He was pointing his gun... at himself. Like this! Had he succeeded, whom would you blame for that accident? My wife, Neelima. She, too, was a victim of an accident. I was driving on the freeway... with the world's most beautiful woman beside me. I was speeding. And she was laughing. 60 miles per hour... 70... 80... 90... 100... 1 10... 120... The last sound I heard was of her laughter. When Neelima passed away... I hugged Nina and cried. But when Nina died... I had no one. When I look at you two... I feel you are so fortunate. So fortunate... that you can at least hug each other and cry. Darling... did this man come to meet you? Did he ask you anything? Did you tell him anything? Sure? If he ever visits you again... and you open your mouth... you know what dad will do, right? My sweet child. Daanish! You better do something about that old man! You're busy punching here, while he's raising hell at the station. He's very upset. Nina's file was closed. May I come in, sir? Here's your friend. Daanish, they've closed Nina's file. Daanish, get him to understand that his daughter Nina... That his daughter Nina Dhar, age 22... died due to falling down the stairs. There were 19 stairs, and each stair was 7 inches. Total height 133 inches. I know these details by heart. After 13 months, 1 7 days and 8 hours... all that's changed in this file is the investigating officer's signature! The report states facts alone, Mr. Dhar. What's the evidence you have? The evidence lies in Qureshi's eyes. Mr. Omkar Nath Dhar, this is real life... not your game of chess. You're right. In chess, rooks and knights walk around... Not rabid dogs. Daanish. - Sir. Get him out of here... Or I will arrest him. Sir. Let's go, Panditji. Come. O Benefactor O Lord O Benevolent one O Lord Be my guide Show me the way Stay by my side Or I'll go astray O Lord... Be my guide Show me the way Stay by my side Or I'll go astray With empty palms, at Your door I stand Seeking wisdom from Your generous hand Be my guide Show me the way Stay by my side Or I'll go astray Do not torment me with doubt This answer I can't live without Papa... O Lord... To Your grace, I appeal, my friend If You shun me, it'll mean my end O Lord... Be my guide Show me the way O Lord... O Lord... O Lord... Show me the way O Lord... O Lord... Show me the way Show me the way Hello? Hello, Mr. Daanish! Mr. Daanish! Panditji! Panditji! Panditji! Hello. Hello? Sartaj! Panditji! - Mr. Daanish! Here! Look what he's done. He ran out that window. I'll check. Look what he's done. Drink some water. - What happened? Wazir. Wazir. Wazir. I was sleeping. Suddenly... I heard a loud noise. When I came out... there was fire My chessboard was burning. A mere pawn... hurls a shoe? At the king? Now play chess with me. Who are you? I could be anyone. Oh yes! I could be the knight... Tick tock! Jumps between light & dark squares! Or the bishop. Never walks straight! But I'm the biggest piece that all the others fear. I am... Wazir! The Queen piece Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall All the king's horses and all the king's men Couldn't put Humpty together... AGAIN! This is the hand that hurled the shoe, right? Does it hurt? The crippled pawn must remember... that one challenges only equals. That's when you call it a game! If a pawn takes on the mighty King... he'll be crushed to death. If you even look at Yazaad Qureshi again... I'll burn you alive! A bit darker under the eyes... thicker beard. Take care. Pammi, please see him out. - Yes. Sir? Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Wazir. I throw a shoe at Qureshi and he sends Wazir. To him, I'm a crippled pawn. He doesn't know that I too have a weapon. My friend... If anything happens to me, my friend won't spare the king. No harm will come to you. I promise! Papa, please help me... Daanish Ali! Is my sketch haunting your dreams? Who's that? - Don't you recognize me? I'm Wazir. I heard your promise, "No harm will come to you" Are you sure? Open your email. See? Making a bomb is so easy! I'm making one too... for your buddy. A bomb - for a shoe! My men are watching Qureshi's core team. We must find Wazir. Start tapping their phones. Including Qureshi's. Daanish, are you crazy? Tap the Welfare Minister's phone? I want Wazir, Sartaj. Isn't it amazing! It's faster than the previous one! Hey, Daanish! Daanish! Do me a favour? - Sure. Please send a 'Thank-You' note. To whom? To Mr. Wazir! There are two sides of every coin. Wazir burned my wheelchair... but that's how I got this new chair! You're a strange man. - I agree. He could've done something worse... Worst case scenario? I'd be dead. Yeah, Sartaj. Where are you? With Panditji, at the hospital. I've got the file of Yazaad's tapped calls. Can we meet? - Sure. Where? Brother, this is the first and last time... that I tap a Minister's calls. If I get suspended too... we'll both be on the roads, selling... Burgers-on-the-go! Mr. Qureshi, I've received the money. Sir, your tickets for Kashmir are booked. Reservations done too. Qureshi's going to Kashmir tomorrow. Wazir speaking. I'll tell SP... Friday, 8pm. Hauz Khas Garden. Friday? That's today! Let's go! Move! Stop! On your knees! Raise your hands! Look up. What's your name? Your name! Tushar. Tushar. Full name! Tushar Sharma. Hello. A little message is all it took to fool you! Where's my 'Thank-You' note? Didn't the old man ask you to send me one? "Hey Daanish! Daanish!" "Do me a favour?" "Please send a 'Thank-You' note." I was right there... watching you... but you didn't see me. I'll kill you! What if I kill your buddy before that? What'll happen to your promise then? If you want to save the old fool... stop tracking me. And keep an eye on him! In Chess Land, there lived a tiny pawn. All the chess pieces loved him. But the pawn had one enemy - the evil king... who made the pawn cry. Teary-eyed, the pawn went to... What's this message? I'm sorry I failed to look after our friend. Will apologize personally in Kashmir. Who is Qureshi talking about? Message sent on 24th November. Who was in Delhi to meet him? Find out who came to meet Qureshi Oh! - Noorie's favourite! You made them? I'll be right back. Thanks for the cake! Storms of disasters fail to make me cry But a moment of your absence will flood my eye Have one. Panditji says wherever she is, it'll make her happy. Go ahead. Whether you say it or you don't My heart can hear... You're with me, my dear You're right here You're with me, my dear You're right here Thank you. Huh? Thank you. Thank you? What for? Ruhana spoke to me today. - Oh! I told you I'll work some magic. What did you think? That Pandit was too drunk to remember his promise? My friend... Vodka turns me into an Einstein! Surely you can afford an occasional smile. When the Creator asks me... "Omkar Nath Dhar..." "What did you achieve in the long life I gave you?" At least I can say... "Sir, I taught a friend to smile." Come beloved... let me take you amidst the stars The oldie keeps listening to this oldie. Let me grant his wish... and send him to the stars. Guess how? Like this. One Two Three BOOM! Daanish. Daanish. Daanish! Sartaj, stay with Panditji. - Yes. See this ticket. Your pal is going to Kashmir... chasing the King. Stop him. Today, just his pawns blew up... but the next time... Get it? Khurana. - Yes, sir. One moment. So, packed everything? Sweater? Jacket? Took everything? It must be freezing there. Where? Yes... I'm going to Kashmir. What for? To hurl the other shoe? No. This time, it won't be a shoe. This is mybattle, Daanish. It's for me to fight. This WAS your battle... Now it's OURS! Pack your stuff. Where are you taking me? - To the safe house. Where Wazir can't reach you... nor you Qureshi! I don't even know who I'm protecting here. Ruhana, I'm dreading the food at that safe house. Won't you treat me to a meal before I go? Of course. It'll be good karma. And yes, I won't come alone. I'll have company. Ruhana, the food is absolutely delicious! You're such a charmer! It's your effect! What say, Daanish? You know... whenever I look at you two... it reminds me of the olden times. That was the era of love. Today, even the spelling of Love has changed to LUV. In these frugal times, your love remains so generous. Don't lose it. Treasure it, like these pictures Whenever dust settles on them... Make sure to wipe it off I'm but a fraction, You make me whole In the game of love A lone heart can't win I too shall meet defeat My love, if you give in Whether you say it or you don't My heart can hear... You're with me, my dear You're right here You're with me, my dear You're right here Storms of disasters fail to make me cry But a moment of your absence will flood my eye Panditji? Hello. Daanish Ali, you took your buddy home... but forgot to cancel his ticket. What? The old man has left for the airport. He'll fly all right, but not in a plane. Daanish! Pick it up! Sartaj, alert all check posts on the way to the airport. What's the matter? Panditji is heading to Kashmir. We must stop him! Just do it, Sartaj! Come ahead. Blue Winger spotted near India Gate. Daanish. - Yeah, Sartaj. Car located. - Where? Near India Gate. Yeah, Sartaj. Are you okay? Yeah, Sartaj. - Rajpath Road, near India Gate. Game over, Daanish Ali. Panditji! This endless cheering means only one thing... Yazaad Qureshi is about to speak. As you can see, this enthusiasm... is a proof that... it'll be a record-breaking election. For the first time in ages... the people of Kashmir are hopeful about elections. Experts believe this will start a healthy debate... on many issues important to Kashmir. When is the next flight to Kashmir? - 9:30, sir. One way or return? One way. Dear Ruhana, the news of my death might reach you... before this letter. I'm really sorry. I failed to be a good father and husband... But I wish to be a worthy friend I can't spare the one who killed Panditji. If I don't return... then think that I am with Noorie. I failed in this world... but in the next, I'll take good care of our child. Forever yours, Daanish. Welcome. SP is expecting you. Local police, army and his personal security. It's a suicide mission. If you can't help, just say it. I didn't say that. I'm just giving you the facts. You saved my life once... I owe you. But why all this? I want Wazir. And only Qureshi knows where he is. Yazaad Qureshi is being honoured with the Peace Award. Qureshi has emerged as the poster boy for peace He has swept the polls in Kashmir. Long live Yazaad Qureshi! Not I, but... my daughter deserves this Peace Award. My daughter Ruhi. Pure and innocent... like our Kashmir. It's after ages... Cameras on, Daanish. Be ready. I want the valleys of Kashmir to bloom again. Long live Yazaad Qureshi! Daanish, are you ready? And I promise... "No harm will come to you" "I promise" I'll bring peace back in Kashmir. Good to go. On my count. Three Two One Daanish, move now! Move! Left. Left. He's going up from the East Wing. He's heading to his room. The commandos are here. I can't hold them up for long. No more than 4 minutes. Hurry up, Daanish. Call Wazir. Call him. Daanish, you're mistaken. I don't know any Wazir. Wait. Let's sit and talk. Where's Wazir? You shouldn't have killed Panditji. You have only 30 seconds. Let's go. Where's Wazir? Ruhi, go out. Come darling... come to dad. Ruhi, go out. Come here. Come to dad. You're not my dad. This man killed my dad. He killed everyone. Killed whom? Everyone. My mom... dad... my entire village. When the army arrived... he got wounded. His friends ran away. He said to the army that he's my father. He could never be my father. My father was a good man. I live each day in fear. He threatened... if I told anyone... he'd push me down the stairs as well. Like he pushed Nina? Nina Ma'am promised me... that she wouldn't reveal his secret. And yet he killed her. I'm very scared of him. Those terrorists still come to meet him. According to our intel... Rameez came to Delhi to meet some politician. Rameez came to meet you? Rameez came to Delhi to meet you! "Papa, please help me..." Breaking news. Yazaad Qureshi was attacked. The Welfare Minister was shot dead. The shocking truth is that... Yazaad Qureshi was just a persona... a mask donned by a ferocious terrorist. He wasn't my father. I wanted to tell everyone... but I was scared. This play is dedicated to Omkar Nath Dhar. Panditji once said to me... There's a riddle in this play. A good chess player can solve it. Well, I don't play chess. If you find the solution, do tell me. Presenting "The Pawn and The King" A game is a game is a game To play to win is a sin Play to learn and you'll win Your mind is your only tool Moves that fool are the rule A game is a game is a game Far far away, in Chess Land... there lived a tiny pawn. All the chess pieces loved him. But one day, the evil king made him cry. Teary-eyed, the pawn went to his Creator O Lord... show me the way. How do I slay the evil king? The Lord said, "Little pawn, you're the heart of chess." Make the right moves, and you'll become... the Wazir. Make the right moves... and you'll become the Wazir. You'll become the Wazir. Mr. Wazir! Wazir! Wazir! On Lord's advice, the pawn befriended an honest rook. You brought my daughter home You've become a friend. To our friendship The rook was a calm fellow... but if his friend got hurt, he'd go crazy. When the pawn in front of him dies... this rook goes on a rampage. To unleash the rook, the pawn played his last move. If anything happens to me, my friend won't spare the King. The pawn sacrificed himself... so that the rook would checkmate the evil King. Now you know the Omkar Nath Special. In this game, you win by losing. When Panditji was attacked... what were you doing there? Wait a sec. I can't hear a thing. Come with me. Did you see Wazir yourself? Yes or no? - Yes! He ran out that window. I saw him myself. What was he wearing? Whatever Panditji said. - What did you see? I came home, Panditji pointed at the window... I saw the window moving, so... So you saw nothing yourself! Panditji said it, so I believed it. Mr. Daanish, one moment. Panditji once said to me... Someday, Daanish will come to you looking for Wazir. Give him this Wazir. This Wazir? Panditji, you're too much. I know this is a pen drive My children use it for recording. "In this game, you win by losing." "Every pawn can become wazir" "The pawn sacrificed himself..." "so that the rook would checkmate the evil king." My friend! You've learned how to learn. And since you're watching this... You've learned how to win. You won! No. You won! No legs, no guns, I had nothing... what else could I do? How would I ever get to Qureshi? This weak pawn had only one option... One step at a time, I reached the last square... And you became Wazir. "Don't you recognize me?" "I'm Wazir." "The oldie keeps listening to this oldie" "Let me grant his wish..." "and send him to the stars." "Guess how?" "Like this... Boom!" The Omkar Nath Special. In this game, you win by losing. Get it? My first move. My first move brought you to my house. This gentleman found your wallet And my last move... My last move took you to Qureshi. Checkmate. Game over, Daanish Ali. What moves! What an end game! This is not the end. My real game has just started. When you watch this tape... I'll be up there listening to Neelima's favorite song! Nina will be with me, and your Noorie too. I'll play chess with your daughter there... while you play here with Ruhana. Play your best game... Live it up! And remember to smile. When the Creator asks me... "Omkar Nath Dhar, what did you achieve..." "in the long life I gave you?" I'll tell Him... I taught a friend to smile. Time to go, Daanish. Time to go. So... may I?
