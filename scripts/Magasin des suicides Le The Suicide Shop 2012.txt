It runs toward the woods It runs at full steam There's joy, the Eiffel tower goes for a walk Like a mad woman she jumps over the Seine, then she says "Too bad for me if I get sick" I was bored all alone In my corner" There's joy... the taxman put on his vest Closes shop and says in a very very kind way Hello, for today the collect is over, keep it all gentlemen. But suddenly I wake up In my bed, So, I was dreaming for sure as the sky is gray I must get up, wash up Get dressed And not sing If you have nothing to say But I still believe That this dream is good As it let me make a song. Song of Spring Song of love Song for 20 years old Song for always There is joy... The Suicide Shop - What happened to you? You wanted to commit suicide? Right?

Otherwise, We also have it synthetic The poison, a variety of vials. Many different speeds. This one, expensive, but crushes you in 3 seconds. You are gone! Gas granules, 1 bullet revolvers. The second is useless. Sleeping pills, toadstools, Or razor blades. Bath, open veins... Unstoppably photogenic. My son sharpens them one by one. Oh yeah. - So? What do you say? In fact... As blades we also have low prices Rusty ones. If you don't cut deep enough tetanus is guaranteed Ah yes, it is tempting. In fact, I hesitate between the gas and the poison. - Yes... - I'll take a poison. Take this. It's on sale. Lightning quick. Guaranteed result. It sells really well. It's trendy. - I'll take that, then. - Lucrce... Do I gift wrap it? - No. It's for me. - It would be more joyful. That's it. Ah yes, still... You can give death to yourself but death itself is not free. Anyway, where you are going you won't spend a penny. Cries of pain Are you expecting a happy event? - Happy, not sure. - It will be soon? - Imminent. And you, you have orphans? Excuse me? I mean you have children? - No. Seeing what life has in store for them... Goodbye, sir. - Thank you very much Madam. Well then, good evening. - Thank you. Sorry. What's good Resisting When life is not rosy When the mood Is gloomy What's the use fighting Against pessimism But what is being proposed - Sadness, horror, etc Nothing to say When one sees that It's not worse than being rats - To stop climbing those stairs To stop seeing this scene To leave before dawn Because in a few moments No regrets Or remorse I will finally be dead. - This isn't very joyful Admit it But it's like that. Admit it, It's no use of crying for him. No shit- It isn't worth staying alive. And yet I believed in it. I did my best. Whatever I could. But I admit defeat. He isn't wrong He is right. At this stage anyway Might as well blow his brains out. Aren't you tired of watching suicides? - Yes, a little. It isn't too much fun. - You are right. I will talk to mom. It's OK. - What's going on? Phone ambulance, maternity. Go on, ma'am. Push, go! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! It's a boy! A very beautiful baby. Oh, he smiled. What's that? My son smiles? No, he isn't. It must be a fold of mouth. Why would he smile? - It looks like a smile. That would be amazing. Nobody ever smiled in our family. Mishima, come here. Why? The client says Alan smiled. What's that story? He must have a diarrhea. It may be confused with a smile, But it's not. It's just a grin. Look. If you push down the corners of the mouth he's sulking Like his brother and sister Since they were born. Let go, to see. Tickle tickle... You see, he's smiling. Alright! What did you want? A rope. To hang myself. - Good. Follow me. Your ceiling is high? - Uh... like that. - You do not know? The noose is all ready. Just put your head through it. Here, it's a gift. My pleasure. How can that be? He smiles? - It was a pleasure to see a baby smile. Yes, yes, it is. Come on, go home. You've better things to do there. - Goodbye, sir. - That's not true. - Shit! Oh, shit! Good morning. I keep telling you, not "good morning." You must say "bad morning" and "goodbye" rather than "see you" since they will never come back. When will you understand that? What can I do for you? As a matter of fact, We are hesitating. - It would be for Mister, or Madam? We would like to go together. - Good. It is more advantageous. For Valentine's Day we have a deal for couples. - What are you hiding behind your back? What will we do with you? You drew your sister busy and pretty. Don't you see she's useless and ugly? I think Marilyn is pretty. Ugly, I'm ugly. I'm really ugly. And there he's, making his sister cry. Oh, it's snowing... - Hum... Well, to us. - What do you say? - It's sad. Exactly, that's sad. And that's why it's pretty. - That's it. You will be happy. - Alan, what do they say? - See you, good night... Pardon me. My mistake. Goodbye. Damn. Too late. - How are the news? - Alarming. - Good. It is good for us. Emergency. I am going. There, there I am coming... - Please. - What is it? It's urgent. I can't stand it. I will see if I have it. Where is it? Where did it go? What are you doing here? - I could not sleep. - 35 Euros. For 1 bullet only? One maybe, but the right one. But in the showcase it's 22 euros. Night rate. - Okay, I take it then. You can come back tomorrow, if you prefer. - Absolutely not! I couldn't wait. - Who was that? - A desperate man with an empty gun. What are you reading? - Statistics for this year. One suicide attempt every 40 min, but only 20% success. It's awful all those people who miss. Fortunately we're here. We are not about to close shop. - Still, it's not fun. Good night, darling. Sweet dreams mom sweet dreams dad. ... I told him, not on the public road! We could lose our license. - Alan hurry up a bit! Why can't we kill ourselves, mom? I've told you 100 times, Marilyn. It is impossible. - Think, poor nitwit, Who would keep the store? Vincent is right. This is a family business started by your great-grandfather, Clestin Tuvache. Later, when we are too old, you will take over the shop. - For the boys yes. But why can't I cut my veins. Because it hurts. And life is beautiful. - No, Alan. Life is appalling. But we must fight. - So, you wanted something... - Hello, it's me again. - Yes, hi there. ...something original, manly... And voila. The seppuku, more commonly known as hara-kiri. Not for everybody. For athletes only. But strong as you are... What is... was your job? -Gym teacher Oh, then it's for you. I thought of gas or napalm... A fine-immolation in a high school courtyard it would be striking. But honestly, seppuku is more classy. I sharpen them myself. Touch the edge of this blade. It enters in you like in butter. Come on, children, let's hurry... - Bye, mom. Vincent! What? - Here is a demonstration. Bye dad. Have a nice day. - Come on. You'll be late. I am not sure I can do it. You do home service? And what else? We are not murderers after all. We provide. People manage. And... it is expensive? Certainly, but the samura kimono is provided: 800 Euros. Ho, it's quite a sum! - A shroud has no pockets. Neither does a kimono ... Excuse me. Then? - Well, I'll take it. - You will not regret it. Our suicides are guaranteed. Our motto: "Dead or reimbursed" You only die once. Might as well make it a unique... ...unforgettable moment. - It can't go on This carnage It's too horrible All those people who All these people who think Only of the grave What's the point In brief To be on earth If we think only If we think only of comitting suicide. A peaceful life Without despair Quiet life And then stop Yes stop moping Death to Death Let's be smart Or else We're all end up We will all end up orphans It's true It's not funny But we can't do anything You shouldn't start as losers The world belongs to us We are only children Just good-for-nothing - I think we can succeed Put an end to suicides Let me think I may have an idea - Let him think - He may have an idea - It is not easy. I hesitate. - Lucrce, can you come? Madame would like something feminin. Feminin-? What's most feminin is poison. It's a bit like a perfume. I was just preparing some in the lab. Yes, a poison! Why not? Here, our entire range declined poison water or concentrated. More expensive naturally but so much more effective. You prefer a contact poison or... to inhale or to ingest? - What is the best? It depends on the desired effect. I especially research the effect of death. - Darling, I'm going. Mr. Calmel's delivery. All this is very tempting. It is. All our products are good. Take your time. I'll let you think. - Can I help you? - This is what? Freeze-dried amanita phalloides. It smells nothing and you feel nothing. Our customers are happy. - How do you know? - None ever came back. - Dying my natural death I have no patience - There's everything you need here We can trust them We don't know what to take. That's why we hesitate. - A rope to hang - Or poison "sudden death" - I thought I'd slash my wrists Is it a good idea That's what my brother in law did, Now deceased. Wait, wait, think - Dying without blisters Or nausea or burns Guaranteed pure product Cyanide pellets This is not good The poison In contrast, The gun shot Frankly I do not recommend It's noisy It's dirty It is not a wonder You failed in your life? Succeed in your death! - What is it? - This is Mr. Tuvache. I bring you your order. Come in, it's open. Take the pads. Enter, Tuvache. Come in. - I do not know what to choose. Sorry to bother you all this time. Not at all. Take your time. - It is not an easy decision. Of course. - Everything is there, Mr. Calmel. Mr. Calmel? Ah! Finally. If you knew how I've had enough of this shit. - What shit? - Life. Ah yes, life... Believe me, Tuvache Go on to the other side, it's the only solution, The end of worries, the big sleep, The extasy... - Still, it isn't very joyful. - It is those who remain who are sad. When you're dead, you won't be there to miss yourself. Think about it, man. Yes, of course. I put it where? Give me that! Finish... For the little bill... - There, under the bed. Finish... - What would you take? - I do not know. To die? Unfortunately I can't allow myself. Must say what is I have regrets And remorse Going on selling death When I see it all All that is wrong All that's not going well I'd like to jump off a bridge - I am not in good spirits. This may be normal With what happens All these people Who leave and pass away - It would be tempting A bloodbath To finish Once and for all With the future - It's not fun Killing people And to not be able Feel more than that about it. To kill oneself, To behead oneself Or be bloodless Suffocated by your own tongue - It makes me feel like ending my life Sometimes I wonder As I really got the blues But we cannot Neither you nor me Because we would have to close shop for good. Whatever happens We must remain alive To insure Happiness to our suicides - Well, I'll take that. You won't regret it. Silly me, I meant Let me know how that went. Hahaha, what a dummy I am! - It's not too noisy, at least? - Are you sure this will work? Sure. - Still, it's risky. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. It's time to move faster. Otherwise, we will all end up orphans. We will meet here. Your father will kill you. - Do not worry. - In any case, it will be great. - Attention... - What are you doing? Playing marbles Dad. And that makes you laugh? - Well yes, it's funny. I don't see what's funny. - Go home. Yes, Dad. Bye Alan... He laughed. - You didn't forget Marilyn's birthday? - I even bought gifts. - Stop laughing all the time, you are irritating me. - Okay. - You look stupid. Yes, Dad. - You want a cigarette? - A what? A cigarette. - Really? Can I smoke? At my age? Of course. Why not? You'll see. This is good for health. Must inhale, keep it inside as long as possible. You like it? Yes, it's not bad. Thank you, Dad. - You see, why not? - I want to kill myself but I don't know if I can afford it. Wait, the cheapest? I have what you need. A bag of our store. Very strong. Ideal for choking. And then here, to close it tight around your throat. Thank you. - How much? - Nothing. When we can help... - lf I had met more people disinterested as you I would not be here. - That's it, that's it Sorry, we are closing. - You want another cigarette? Yes, I do. - Here, keep the pack. If you want, I will give you a cartridge. Thanks, Dad. Stay here. Finish your cigarette quietly. Light up another if you wish. And do not forget, inhale all the smoke. Yes, Dad. Good evening, my dear. Good evening my love. Alan is not with you? Yes, yes. He is there. - But he smokes! What... - I'll explain. - Mom, Alan is smoking... - We will explain. - Are you okay Alan? - Good day? And school? Yes, yes. All is well. There is joy... Hello, hello... And there it is... Oh, it's me. Mom, it's so beautiful. Vincent drew it. Yes, it's me. - I wish I could die. - Tell yourself that you have 1 year less to live. And now, the gifts... This is too cute. Thank you. And this is so cute. - You Alan, what's your gift? - A scarf to strangle me... - But no. It is worn loose, vaporous. Like a caress around your neck. And that? - This is to dance with it. I'll show you. - Where did you get this? - I bought it with my pocket money. - But you're crazy. You shouldn't have. Yes, for you, nothing is too beautiful. Therrre iiiis joyyyy... - How is it going? - Hi. You have the music? - OK. That is good. Your uncle? - I am sure he will agree. - Perfect. And our reward? - Patience. - You want some? - NO... - You should. It is good for health. - Who's is the idiot who told you that? - My father. What's wrong with him? Tobacco gives cancer. You want to die young? - Well... No. Then throw it away. It's shit. Don't move. It will start. - Come on. - She is beautiful, eh, my sister? - But... But... But... Mishima? What are you doing? What's going on? - There is that... - But... Oh... There... I am here.. All is well. - Hello Sir. - Hello children. What brings you here? - Uncle Dom, we need a favor from you. - If I can.

Not anymore. Madam, I ask you the hand of your daughter. I don't know her name... - Marilyn. - Marilyn. And with whom I just fell in love, and who restored my appetite for life. - Yeah... - Mom, please, say yes... - Well... yes... But on one condition. - Anything you want. That you help us to clean up all this mess. - Mom, I love you. Me too, I love you. - I intended to leave this earth Horrible and evil To fall asleep with ether But against all odds It fell on me Of course without warning I never received Such a look from a girl - The charms of destiny have unpredictable twists and turns. - I saw everything in black It's nothing to say it. I was in despair And who would have predicted That love would come In this obscure shop A cheerful young man Wearing pretty face - The charms of destiny have unpredictable twists and turns. - No more wasted nights No more days of suffering Let's live in the wonder of a common attraction All is allowed so long As love blooms. Dawn after dawn Life will follow its course. The charms of destiny will perfume our days. But how did you? It is so clean we could eat on the floor - I was going to propose it. I am Breton and I make perfect crpes. How about a crpe picnic here, right now? Oh yes, why not? It's delicious. - It's true, crpes are good. - You are a real gem. - You embarrass me. - He is the perfect man. What about changing the suicide shop to a shop for something else? - A shop for what? - I don't know we can try. Anyway the stock is ruined. We could open a crperie. - This is an idea. Crpe evoke mourning. The clients will not be disoriented. - What is this shit? - I forgot about him! -Someone can explain? - It's me Dad. Everything is my fault. Attention, move over! Pardon me, madam. Mishima, stop it now! - Calm down, Dad. - I'll explain. - You will explain nothing! Come here, bastard! Mishima, if you kill this child, I kill myself! Please Mishima... - Okay, I made a very big mistake, I'm sorry... I beg your pardon. I propose a deal. An honest deal. You're a great dad, the best dad. But you're a serious dad, too serious. Everybody is. You never laugh, not even smile. So if right here, right now I can make you laugh, you forgive me? - Bastard, Mishima! You have the death of this child on your conscience. Oh no... - Assassin! - But I... I... What... - He's alive. Mom... - He's flying. Ball. You would like? One skull-outbreak, one! The "Red Beard" crpe is for? - For me! - Thank you. - Hello, it's me again. - What a good surprise. What brings you? - You would have a...? - Pardon? A cyanide crpe? - Do not move. Hold. Keep it closed, you fool. If my wife learnt I still sell those, She would kill me. - How much? Nothing. - There is no reason - It is in memory of the bad old times. Good day. - Thank you. - Goodbye madam. - Lucrce, I thought about something. Yes, what? - A loyalty card. because now happy customers come back. What do you say? - Very good idea. - Arghh... We were stupid. Today everything is clear. Down with morbidity Since life is splendid. Living on homicides Made us livid Let's be lucid and death to sucide. - My face of Lent I'm tired of it. - There is no problem He's less white I love life and even - Vincent, we love you - I will write poems We repainted the world In a few seconds To no longer see All these filthy colors You are right Alan, We must keep the banana. Death we are condemning. You see we are gliding. - It's crazy when you think about it. A matter of common sense. Goodbye violence. Deliverance at last. And therefore no more suffering The beautiful life starts - For us it's over. We lost it all. But we get used to it. If we had known We would have lived As it's evident Do not pity us. You don't know your happiness. Being passed away Isn't a happy affair. An abundance of laughs, like a perfume Which surrounds us. The dead season Isn't our kingdom anymore. So we must listen to all these ghosts. All together now Gloom, go home! We listen to you, Miss We trust you. Be natural, and without shades. - Love spellbinds me, Sweet romance. - It's the universal attraction! - No dream is impossible. So long as you believe in it strongly. And if it's sometimes painful, Life is always better than death. - It's all black, I'm scared. A match? - No, don't do that...
