Competition always is keen among the huge field of participants, who bowl in qualifying play for one of 63 positions in the match play final. The defending champion is exempt from qualifying. As usual the event has attracted bowling's elite, including Master's champions. My grandfather told me that Earl Anthony was the greatest bowler that every lived. He used to watch videos of him with my dad and Uncle Sean when they were kids. Earl was a left-handed bowler... a south paw, my grandfather said... who kept his hair short and his glasses on. He was square... so square the other bowlers called him Square Earl. He won 43 titles in his life. In 1975, he was the first bowler to earn over $100,000. And in '82, he was the first to make over $1 million in lifetime earnings. And in 2000, he was named Master of the Millennium by "Bowling Magazine. " On August 14, 2001, he fell down a flight of stairs at a friend's house and died. After everything he'd done, he hit his head on the floor and that was it. The great Earl Anthony gone forever. That got me to thinking. What happens to us when we die? Are we just gone... finito, kaput? Or do we live on forever? And if we do, where do we go? Where had the greatest bowler of all time gone? Where was Earl Anthony? Eli, we've been talking for a while now, and I want to help. But maybe you should tell me the reason you're here. The reason I'm here... well, my family's Presbyterian, but we don't go to church. Because honestly it's just not a very satisfying religion, so I'm thinking of becoming Catholic. And for me the whole idea of an afterlife is very appealing. Presbyterians believe in heaven and hell. Well, yes, but not purgatory. I like the idea that if you mess up, you go somewhere and do whatever to make up for it. And then you go to heaven. I just kind of want to know what would constitute truly evil... because for me... truly evil is kind of a game changer. Have you done something you want to tell me about? No. Would you say killing someone would be truly evil? Have you killed someone? No. But what if someone was about to kill your mother? And you had to make a choice... kill him or let him kill your mother? There's really no choice, now is there? You have to kill him. Now I say that's a purgatory-heaven situation. What do you say? Well, it used to be you could count on your sports seasons in this country. Now you've got fall baseball, soccer... which never quits... and now lacrosse, squeezing itself in wherever it can. I mean, are we even in America anymore? Yo know it's an Indian game. What, lacrosse? Mm-hmm. Oh, let me guess... we stole it from them. Sometimes I think you take that whole my grandmother was an American Indian thing a little too far. McAllister Sports? Oh, hey, Hal. Sure. Hey, Hal. What? Well, no. No, I know he's your son-in-law, Hal, but does he even bowl? OK. OK. Well, how bad is Jesus? Yeah, no, I'm fine with it. I'll see you there. What... what happened? Jesus sawed off the tips of his middle and his index finger on a job... on his bowling hand no less. He's in a cast for three weeks... right before the Fiesta Cup. Thanks, Jesus. Thanks. Thank you. I'm sure he didn't mean to. Aw, I mean, come on. Even on his best days Jesus could never replace Rick. But I thought, you know, maybe we might still have a shot, but now we've got Hal's son-in law who bowled a little in high school. I'm sorry. No, I... I... I just feel bad for Eli is all. I got to go. He likes meeting me at the alley. You know, he's great at keeping stats that kid. How much of an athlete though. You know, Sean's probably at Rick's. You want to stop by there first? No, Eli'll be waiting for me. Hey. wait a minute. Have a good practice. Ow. Where you going, midget? Wolf, just leave me alone. I... Are you going to stop me? Yeah, like that's going to happen. Not. I already did your math homework. And I was thinking maybe you could write my history report. What? Hey! I told you go to store. I'm going. Who's this? Just a friend from school. You got a name? Eli McAllister, sir. Ain't I seen you around a bowling alley? I keep stats for my grandpa's bowling team. Dick McAllister's your grandpa? Yes, sir. So that means your dad's Rick McAllister? Yes, sir. Now, your dad and grandpa used to kick our asses in the Fiesta Cup. You know I went to high school with your dad. I didn't know that. What the hell are you still doing here? Go! It's a fucked up world, kid. I'm sorry, sir? You're dad... a decorated war hero and a hell of a ball player... gets sick. You're freaking uncle makes more money than God. You give your dad my best. You tell your grandpa we're going to take the cup of his hands this year. Hey. Where's Eli? He's at the bowling alley with your dad. He's keeping stats for the tournament. He told me. Said the cup is as good as ours already. Hey. How we doing? Hmm? OK. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Were you able to get a nap at all? Mm-mm. No? How's your pain? Not so bad. Could we just... he just woke up? It's good to stay ahead of it. All right. Play me something. I can't believe you had that thing brought in here. Music. You. One in the same to me. Hey, Sean. OK, Mr. Big Shot over here. OK, everybody calm down. No, no, no. Sorry, you're not old enough. -Neither are you. Dude... she's the same age as I am. Well, yeah, but you're driving us all home. I'll drive. Lucky. Glenn, have a beer with me. I can't. I have a bio test in the morning. I know when we were not wanted. Give me that. Oh, come on, man. What the fuck are you doing here? What? You fucking deaf? You're always fucking hanging around like some fucking baby puppy. Knock it off, Tim. No, seriously, this is a football party. There's no sophomores on the football team. It's Rick's little brother, man. So? This turned into a family picnic? I could have brung my little brother along. Oh, yeah? Well, unfortunately, Tim, they only allow one retard per party and you're already here. Hey! What? You want some, huh? Come on. You got something to say, just say it to me asshole. Say it to me! I'm Sean. Hi. Come on up, from hospice. Come on in. They've, uh... they've been expecting you. Glenn set up a room for you. Right here. You're, uh, much better looking in person. Huh? The "GQ" article. Um, pictures don't do you justice. Thanks. Is Glenn here? Yeah, she's with your brother. Come on. When was last time you saw your brother? A while. Well, his cancer's fairly advanced so he's pretty distressed physically. Sean. I'm so glad you came. Yeah, he's on a morphine drug. And Anna's giving him more now, so he sleeps... most of the time. What'd the doctor say? No more doctors. It's just he would have been so much better if he hadn't done the chemo. I thought he was... He wasn't... I mean, it's not the doctor's fault. He as much as said that he had no hope. But you know him, he's always ready to fight. So how's life across the pond. God, his friends brought this in here. It's so big and it's a mess. It's good. Good. It's good. So we saw the article in "GQ" and he was really proud... and Eli too. Yeah. So, have you... have you... have you talked to your father? No. Just Evie. Yeah, Evie's been really great. She's been helping so much. How are you? Really good... I... I'm good. And Eli? Yeah, he's... he's as good as can be, yeah. I just... your dad stopped coming to see Rick. What? When? Yeah, this last week. You know, you remember he did that with your mom too. And Rick doesn't really say anything. I'll talk to my dad. I'm so glad. He's going to be so happy to see you. Thought you said he played in high school. Just give him a chance. At least he hit a pin this time. Yeah. Hey, maybe I could play. No, rules are rules kiddo. Are you hungry? Here. Go get us a couple of burgers. We're going to head out now. We'll come tomorrow at lunch and see if we can't make any progress. Right, Ben? Some mechanism of the wrist that I just can't seem to get. I'm going some of my videos. Watch Earl Anthony. He was a southpaw too. Still, Dick Weber was the best. In what universe? Are you kidding? Weirdo Anthony couldn't touch Weber. I'd say Earl's record speaks for itself. And I would a nerdy weirdo over show boat any day of the week, Hal. Well, don't worry. I'm usually able to master concepts very quickly. Come on. A guy like you... a piece of cake. Well, we'll see you tomorrow. Hey. How you doing? Is it bad? Mm-mm. OK. Where you from, Anna? Lovely Newark, New Jersey. What brought you here? I needed a change of pace, to start travelling a little bit. I like it here. People are nice. There air is clean. It's quiet. And it has the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen. My mom used to make Sean and me sit with her, wave goodbye to the sun when we were little. That's your mom, huh? She's very beautiful. Sometimes I hear her calling me. How long ago did she pass? Six years ago. Uncle Sean. Hey. Eli. Wow. You've gotten so big. Dad. Sean. When did you get here? This afternoon. There was a big car accident on the road, and it took a while. Where... where you guys coming from? The bowling alley. Grandpa's got the Fiesta Cup on Saturday. Hal's still playing? Oh, yeah. And Hal's son-in-law, Ben. Oh, really. How's he? He's a disaster. He's not so bad. Oh, come on. He's almost as bad a bowler as your uncle here. Come on, let's go see dad. You know, I have to go. I have to pick up Evie, then I have to lockup so... But... grandpa... I'll be back later with Evie. Yeah, listen. Good job keeping those stats, kiddo. It's important. Well, listen, I got to go. See you later, OK? He never stays. Yeah, I mean... he's just... so, Eli, are you bowling in the tournament too? No, I can't. Kids aren't allowed. Oh. You know, my dad, Hal, and grandpa won it five years in a row before my dad went to Iraq. Yeah, well... they were always good bowlers, those three. Are you as bad as he said you were? Actually bowling was my best sport... which isn't saying much. Do you want to go see my dad? Sure. Oh, Uncle Sean. Would you mind not telling me dad that Ben's not a good bowler? Of course. Come on. Thanks. So, you know, this is difficult for everybody, but young... Hey, Dick. Dan. I, uh... just getting some talc. Getting ready, you know. You're still in the tournament? Of course I am. Great. Um. [clears throat] Charlie was talking about maybe stopping by to see Rick tomorrow. Great. There you go. See you Saturday. My best to Cora. Yeah, she's in Phoenix. What was that look for? I can't stand Charlie Cornfelder. We had to play ball with that idiot for four years. Way to go, Evie. He asked about Rick. People want to say goodbye. This is happening, and you can't... What, Evie? What can't I do? I'm going to go see Rick. Do you want to come? I have to finish up here. Here's mom with John's neighbor, that crazy old lady with one eye. What was her name? Miss Ramirez? She... [laughs] Wait, wait... She's... I thought she was a witch. She's... she's like, you guys are going to go to hell. Remember she caught us bombing cars? What happened? Yeah. So, your dad and I, and John were bombing cars with oranges. And one of the car swerved and clipped her fence. So we were trying to run and get away, and Miss Ramirez comes out and sees us. Us? You were the only one she saw. You ran away and left me. Yeah. What happened? Your dad and John were faster than me, so I had to run up and climb a tree to get away. And I stayed in the tree until dad came to get us. What did grandpa do? Yelled. A lot. I got a whooping. Did you? No. Your dad took the fall. Said it was his idea. Yeah. Was it? Probably. Hi, looks cozy in here. I've Evie. Hey, um, it's nice to finally meet you in person. Nice to meet you. Hello, sweetheart. Hey, guys. I'm sorry to intrude here. I just want to get this guy something to get him through the night. Glenn, you can give him one of these pills if he wakes up in pain, OK? Can we just give him a lower dose? I mean, it's just been so long since we've all been together like this. It doesn't work like that. Actually it's way past someone's bedtime. I don't want to go to bed. Come on, go with Evie, sweetheart. It's a school night. I don't want to go to school. We've talked about this before. Come on. I'll tell you a story... a short one. Your stories are never short, Evie. I love you, kiddo. I love you, too. Will you come tuck me in? Yes, in a few minutes. Yup. Goodnight, Uncle Sean. Goodnight. Long ago, there were two sisters. Blue Dawn and Dancing Wind, her younger sister. One day, their mother told them to get their baskets and go fill like with pinions for the coming winter. She warned them, come home before dark, and do not cross the river. Well, they couldn't find that many pinions near the puebla. So they wandered further until they came to the river. On the other side of the river, they saw trees full of pinions, and Dancing Wind said their mother would never find out if they crossed the river and filled their baskets. Blue Dawn tried to resist but she couldn't. So they walked down the river till they found some rocks where they could cross. Then they started picking as many pinions as they could. Soon their baskets were fulled of pinions. And they decided to go home. On their way back, the sun began to fade behind the mountain. And it became very, very dark. They couldn't find the rocks to cross the river. And they began to cry. Raven heard their cries and he flew down beside them. He told them he would carry them across the river. But in exchange, he asked for one of the baskets of pinions. Then Raven grabbed Blue Dawn, and flew her across the river. He returned to Dancing Wind. He picked her up and began to cross the river. But high in the sky above the river, he stopped. And he said. Why don't you give me that basket, I'll carry it in my beak. The little girl refused. And Raven became so mad, he let go of her. And she fell, far, far, far down into the land of the night sky, where true to her name she danced along the wind until she found a star she could grab a hold of. Far down below, she heard her sister calling to her, come back, come back. And she began to sob. The star asked her, why are you crying? And she told him what had happened, and how much she missed her family and how she wished she had listened to her mother. The star took pity on her, and he flew her back down to earth, and landed her right beside her sister. And now it's time to go to sleep. Tell me the rest, Evie. Tell me about the star. When Dancing Wing went into the land of the night sky. She went where souls go when they die. And your grandmother told you. My grandmother told me that when you see a falling star, it's a soul coming back to earth, getting a second chance. Do you think my dad will get a second chance? I don't know, sweetheart. So then my guy evolved to a Charizard which has like 250 HP. He's... he's like a... he's a fire type. He's a great, um, great Pokemon. Now we're off on the world of Pokemon I know nothing about. You better get going. Uh, Evie's not here. She's not? I'll stay with Rick. You... you go ahead. No, Evie takes him. You go to school that we went to, right? Yeah. Well, I think I know how to get there. Go get your stuff. I love you. Eli. I'll be here when you get back, OK? We'll play Pokemon. OK. Love you. Love you, mom. Bye. I'll be back. So, you like school? Sixth graders are assholes. Did you like school? No. Too many assholes. How come you never came to see us? I came to see you. Six years ago, when grandma died. I was five. Uh, my business took off and... I don't know. Mom told Evie you didn't come because of grandpa. Oh, yeah? Do you believe in hell? Uh, no. But then again I don't really believe in the afterlife. Or God. Why not? I don't see any evidence for it. Energy is neither created nor destroyed, merely transformed. First law of thermodynamics. Meaning? Meaning that if you think that humans are energy, like I do, they transform at death. They don't just disappear. Do you like designing women's clothes? I design for men too. Do you have to sew? No. I just come up with the ideas. Other people sew. Mom hasn't changed clothes in like a week. She doesn't play piano anymore. She used to play for me before bed. Good morning, guys. How did we do through the night, huh? He's OK. Yeah, you didn't have to give him too many pills? None. It... he was OK. I'm going to give you something now. Glenn, you know where the morphine is? What... no... you were the last... you were the last one to give him the injection, right? I don't... some... it was on the table. Uh, Eli. Your mom is going through a tough time. If you need to talk... Yeah, I'm... uh, I... I'm late for school. I... I should go. Eli! Hey, Eli! I... I'll pick you up from school. Oh, no. That's okay. Well, no... I... I'd like to. Two o'clock? Three! What's going on, buddy? Yeah, what's up, bro? Yeah. We're going to get pumped today... Sean? Sean McAllister? Oh, my God, it is you. God, you're still gorgeous. Thank you, uh... Nan! Nan, come over here. Oh my God, Sean. I just bought some of your pants. That's crazy. Oh my God, you don't remember me, do you? We were cheerleaders. Ready? OK. You can do it, that's OK. You can beat 'em anyway. Of course, yes, yes. That's right. Hey, I'm so sorry to hear about Rick. I mean he survives Iraq and now this happens. Yeah, um, Mike's going to go see him later. Shhh. You know, I got to grab this. Oh, sure. Sean, this is Ana. I was wondering if you could swing by the pharmacy and pick up your brother's prescription. I got to... I got to get going... Oh. Oh, OK. Bye. Bye. See ya. God, he's gorgeous. And uber successful. He's gay, right? Yeah, I think so. Bummer. So remember, nocturnal emissions or wet dreams as they are often called are a healthy, normal part of a maturing boy's life. Any questions? Nocturnal emission, where's my history paper? I... I didn't have time. Do you want to die? Leave him alone, Wolf. Who's going to stop me, four eyes? We have an arrangement, don't we, Eli? Don't we? No. No, Wolf. I don't think we do. I think I'm just staving off the inevitable, that at some point, you're going to cream me. But you know what, Wolf? You're going to fail at everything. And not because you're stupid, but because you're not stupid enough. If you were more stupid, you'd be nicer, because being stupid wouldn't bother you. But you're smart enough to know you're stupid, which makes you mad and scared, which makes you mean. Anyway you'd look at it, you're screwed. Our arrangement is over. Hey, you! You. Go to the office! You're dead. Everybody go to class. There's nothing to see here. What happened? Nothing. Eli, I know your family's gone through a rough time right now. Would you like to go home? No. My mom thinks it's best if I come to school. Is there anything I can do for you? I'd just like to go to class. Hey. Thank you so much for taking Eli to school. My alarm didn't go off. No problem. I was just picking up Rick's medication down the block so I thought I'd stop in. Great. Thank you. I'll go get your dad. No. Uh... I can find it. Of course you can. Sure. Dad? You tell me what happened. Don't you lie to me. Dad, please. What did that coach see? What do you think he's just making this up? Who was with you, Sean? No one. God almighty. What you do reflects on our family. I'm not going to tell your mother and don't you either. Don't you tell anyone, you hear me? Well, this is a surprise. Uh... I was just picking up Rick's medication. I thought I'd stop by. John got that scholarship to Northwestern and the brother got into the Naval Academy after that game. I remember. You know John's thinking about running for mayor of Los Angeles. I didn't know that. So, how's England? It's good. Good. I have to unload some golf balls. I'll help you. I'm going to go take Glenn some lunch. You guys OK? Nah, we're fine. OK. OK Would you mind bringing this to Ana? Of course. I'll see you after bowling practice. Evie seems nice. Yeah. The store hasn't changed at all. If it ain't broke, why fix it? Dad. You got to see Rick. Glenn says you haven't been there in a week and you just got to go. You know, that's rich... you telling me I need to go see your brother. Let me ask you something, Sean... where the hell have you been for the last six years? Or for that matter, the 16 years before that? I don't think there's much time, Dad. Oh, really? You don't? You know, I don't know what I'd do without you and Evie breathing down my goddamn neck. I was here when your brother got the diagnosis. And I have been here every day since, helping his son... your nephew... who you have seen, what, maybe three times his entire life? It's not about me, Dad. It's not? It's not about me. You did the same thing when mom got sick. Don't you dare bring up your mother to me. I held your mother's hand as she drew her dying breath. That's because Hal made you. You would barely go near the room. You broke her heart, Sean. You never even came to see her. You never came back, after all she did for you. I never came back because you didn't want me to, Dad. Come on. Why don't you fucking tell the truth for a change? You could barely look at me after that night. And the last two years, I was here, I felt like... The last two years? Dear God, Sean, I knew what you were long before that. Go see, Rick, OK? Go see your son. What you do reflects on our family. Hello? Hey. You OK? No. Your brother? Ah, no. No. It's, uh... I don't know. Sean, what's wrong? Yeah, it's so complicated. Yes, it is. It shouldn't have to be. Listen, Sean. I can't do this right now. Do what? This. I know that you're in pain, and... We can't talk about it. I can't be there with you while you're going through it. So what exactly am I meant to do? I'm sorry that was... Um... I... I... I've go to go. Yeah. OK. Bye. Bye. Glenn. John. Hey, sweetie. I'm so glad you came. Oh, Rick. Look who's here. Oh. The morphine. So... Are Mercedes and the girls with you. Yeah. Yeah, they're at my mom's getting settled. Oh, here. Let me show you. Oh, wow. They are gorgeous like their mother. And Manny? Oh, no, no, no. We don't call him Manny now. No, it's Manuel. I still can't believe you had him your freshman year at college. Yeah, yeah. Well, when we went all the way, we really want all the way. You're stupid. There. There you go. Hey, how's Eli? Oh, he's holding up. He's, um... This is from when they went camping in August. He looks just like Rick. I think he looks just like Sean at that age. Yeah, I guess he does. Hey, how's Sean? Is he here? Yeah, yeah. He's at the store with Dick. You know, I hope they're getting along, you know. Oh, I got to pee. Oh, go. Go. Oh, shit. Goddamn it. Sean? Kim? Hi. Oh my gosh. You look gorgeous as ever. And you haven't changed a bit. Oh, please. I saw you on the cover of some magazine. You've made it to the big time. Uh, yeah. Well, uh... and you... last I heard, you're a doctor. Oh. Yeah, technically. I've got my MD. And I got my Ph. D. Genetics. This is my business now. According to Kim, Tai Chi for the Spiritually Challenged. Girls, got to make a living. From cloning to Tai Chi... that's quite a jump. Ah, yeah. It's a long story. I have some time. You want to give me a hand? Sure. So. You want to hear my theory? Shoot. I've decided that it's only through our relationship with others that we can truly understand ourselves. It's very new agey for a scientist. Sean, I've been surrounded by Petri dishes for the last 20 years. You're the best date I've had, and that was 24 years ago. Well, you, uh... you want to dance? I'd be lying if I said yes. But since it is a dance... OK. I can't believe you invited me and not one of thousands of girls that have a crush on you. Well, I had to pick between someone who couldn't dance, and someone who couldn't string a sentence together. Hey, little brother. Look at John. Hey! Let Mercedes breathe, John. Ow. Uh, sorry. He's killing me. Go ahead and laugh but my little theory has greatly improved my life. I mean, I've done all kinds of things that I wouldn't have done with people. Like Tai Chi. Like Tai Chi. I'm taking salsa. I'm online dating. I'd venture to say you're a tall order for match. com. Sky diving. Out of planes? Yes, exactly. After you get past the initial terror, when you're falling, it's the most peace I've ever felt. OK. Enough about me. How's your family? It's funny you should ask about my family. I think that's my nephew. He's supposed to be in school right now. I better... Oh. I promise, next time we talk about you. You are a great girl. Always have been. Excuse me. Well, the matinee actually started 20 minutes ago. No. I'm actually looking for a little boy, 11 years old, dark hair, red hoodie, backback. Eli. Yes. Eli. Uh... He's my nephew. Oh, well. He had an appointment with their spiritual leader, Guru Sai. It was originally for later today but he moved it up. Spiritual leader? Our center is upstairs above the theater. I believe Eli has joined Guru Sai for lunch. Well, I believe I would like to join them. Ah. There they are. Have a beautiful day. You too. Namaste. Likewise. Uncle Sean, what are you doing here? Well, that's funny. I was just going to ask you the same thing. I... had an appointment... That you moved up. Yes, I heard. You're supposed to be in school. Eli has graced me with his company for lunch while I help him with a school project. It's for social studies. Really? Come, please. Join us. I think we should get going. I'm not going back to school. Today's lentil dal day and I doubt if you've had any better, Mr.? McAllister. Sean. Another bowl for Eli's uncle. Come. Very well. I get the ball, right? I... I... turn. And there he is. Bam! It was my fault we ran into each other. I think he's still seeing birds. Tweet, tweet, tweet. You ran the wrong play. Hey, guys. Sorry. I'm just going to sneak in here and give him his meds. OK? Yeah, we should, uh, probably go. No! No, you don't have to leave. I mean, we're having such... such a nice time. Hey, it's OK. I... uh, I could come back tomorrow. What time's good? Anytime is good. Bye. See you, hon. Bye, sweetie. Ah, thank you. We'll see you. Love you, honey. Bye. Bye. Thanks. Call you tomorrow? Yes. Great. OK. Perfect. Ana. Yeah? Can I talk to you over here for a minute? Sure, what's up? You couldn't have waited one minute. Glenn, we have to stay ahead of the pain, or it's going to get really bad, really fast. He was fine. He was not in pain. He was having a good time with his friends. He was enjoying them. I know, I understand. But your husband's a really stoic guy, and he doesn't want you to know if he's in pain. But I can assure you, he is. And keeping him Medicated makes your job that much easier. No, no, no. No, because then you just have a nice, quiet patient. Right? It's not about that. Just give him the shot. Although reincarnation sounds pretty neat, not all of us want to come back for another life. How do not come back? Have you heard of karma? Ah, your dal. Simply put, karma is the universal law of action and reaction. Good actions gain good reactions. And evil actions bear evil reactions. If one's karma is really good, one can get out of coming back. So, what if you do something in this life, but you didn't mean to. You know. It... it wasn't your fault, not really. But, you had to carry it. It's impossible for us to predict our future lives. But we believe that if a man's good deeds balance his bad deeds, his soul will be united with Krishna. Is there any proof that incarnation exists? Proof is all around you. Just look at nature. In the summer, the tree flourishes. And in the winter, it loses its leaves and dies. And there it is in the spring, alive and full of beauty. This is the cruel cycle of life. We humans think we are apart from it, but the truth is we are not. Oh, there's grandpa's truck. He'll drive me home. You're not going to tell my mom about today, are you? Hey, Eli. I think that God looks at soldiers differently. And think he sees they do things they don't want to. I thought you don't believe in God. I don't. But if I did, I think he'd be super smart, and he'd see the whole picture and all the... Extenuating circumstances. Yeah. What are you doing? Just getting my stuff. You know, maybe I'll come in for a while. Oh. Yeah, yeah. If you... if you want to. Check out the team. That sounds great. Yeah. Yeah. Hey! I thought I told you to bring me Coke. Uh! My back! For God's sakes, Hal! What... here. Easy. Dad. Dad. Don't do that. You might make it worse. Tell them to go get an ambulance. Oh, he doesn't need an ambulance. It's just a spasm. He might. Dad. Uncle Hal, has this ever happened before? Yeah. 20 years ago. 20 years ago, you got to be kidding me, Hal. What are you doing? Yeah, pour it on his face genius. That'll help. What happened? Nothing. He's fine. There were a couple paramedics in the coffee shop. They'll be right down. Thank you. Listen, you're going to be fine, Hal. OK? Guess this sort of kills the Fiesta Cup for you, Dick? Too bad. What did you say? Easy there, big fellow. I'm just stating the obvious. You know what's obvious, Tim. You are an asshole. That's what's obvious. Calm down. Dick. Don't tell me to calm down, asshole. You want to watch the language, old man? You want to see what an old man can do to you? You want to see that? Guess I'll see you tomorrow. I guess you will. Come on. Let it go. Good luck. I'll be better tomorrow, Dick. You'll be OK, Hal. Just take it easy. What are we going to do? I'm afraid that's it, kiddo. It's too late for me to find someone else, Eli. I'm sorry. No. You can't just give up. I'm not giving up. We just don't have a choice. Yes, we... Eli, I know you're disappointed. No... you're the one that always says we can't give up. Eli. No! Eli, it's OK. No. No, it's not. We can't give up. Come here. You know I would do anything for you. But the tournament is tomorrow morning. But... I promised my dad... What did you promise your dad? That we'd bring him the cup. I could bowl for Hal. I'm a little... a lot rusty. But... I could. Yes! Yes, yes. That's a great idea. No. Wait. Wait. Uncle Sean said it was his best sport. Eli, we're... we're bowling against some tough competition here. Well, who... what? The important thing is to not give up, right? When's the last time you bowled? Does it matter? Go get some shoes. Yes. Ana? Uh, I don't need you anymore, Ana. What? I... I can stay till the boys get back. No. Not just tonight. I don't need you anymore at all. I'm sorry, Glenn. I'll be calling hospice tomorrow to find a replacement. Hey, I'm sorry if I... I... Thank you for everything. OK. Please. OK. OK. That's too much shoulder. Remember... you want to shake hands. You want to... Dad. I got it. All right. I think you're doing great, Uncle Sean. Come one. Oh, and remember... remember. We have to be here at 10 AM. Shit. Are you OK? Did you find the remote? OK, it's going to be fine. OK. Christ, that took you long enough. Oh, here you go, dad. This is a good show. There we go. OK, mom it's fine. Can we talk outside? You head home. I'm going to spend the night here, so you're going to have to get Janie breakfast. And I'll come home early, so you can make the tournament. And tell Brenda I will pay her what I owe her tomorrow. Brenda? The babysitter, Christ! Oh! Crap. Ana? Mom? What? Hal hurt his back, so Uncle Sean is now on the team. Oh, well. That's... Is Hal OK? He's fine. Just pulled his back out. Where is Ana? She went home. And Evie went to the store, and... and she'll see you at home. I'd like to sit with him, if that's OK with you. OK. OK. Let's go. I love you. We're probably not going to win the cup this year, although it's certainly not for lack of Eli's trying. That kid is something. I wish you could see it. Hal's son-in-law is replacing you and... Sean is replacing [laughs] Hal. It's like watching two giraffes try to bowl. And the sad thing is... is that Hal's son-in-law makes Sean look good. I was 22 when I had you. ANNOUNCER:It's not often you see such consistency, especially when the stakes are this high. And there's another strike for Earl Anthony. Here's a profile of Anthony from the back. Notice how he lifts the ball straight through his high hand going over the top of the ball very smoothly. You know, Bo, Earl Anthony will probably go down in history as one of the greatest bowlers that every lived, if not the greatest. Look at his form. Right there. Another strike. Doesn't get better than that. You know just not on his game today. Piece of cake. Sean? Yeah? Sean, am I dead? No. You're here with me. Glenn? She's sleeping. I went somewhere. Well, you're here now. I missed you. I missed you too. I'm sorry I wasn't here. You're here now. That night... I know it was Pinky. Hey! Shhhhh. Shhhh. It's OK. Mom? Oh, it's OK, sweetie. He's just tired. You ready, Eli? Mm-hmm. When does Ana get here? Oh, she should be here any minute. You, OK? Yeah. We are going to have that cup for you when we come home. I wouldn't count on it. Good luck. Listen. We're not going to get past the first round. But I really, really appreciate you stepping in for us like this. Do we have shirts? Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. Here you go. Yeah. Hey. Sorry we're late. Put this on. Go get some shoes. Here Eli. How about this? This is your shirt, huh. Eli, listen... uh, Ben? Why don't you warm up? Listen, Eli. I don't want you to get your hopes up too high. I mean, there's three rounds to this tournament. And we probably won't make it past the first round. So, we're all going to have to be OK with that, you know. I mean, winning is always great, but your dad will be proud of us with or without that cup. But the important thing is... the fact thing is we did not quit. Grandpa! Did that just happen? You're so beautiful. Everyday I would go by the rec room on my way to football. And I'd hear this beautiful music. And I'd stop in the hallway and listen. One day I worked up the nerve, and I opened the door and there you were. There were so many things. So many horrible things, till I saw... and I did. And then I would imagine myself back in that hall again. Outside that door listening to you. Glenn. I can't fight this. Hey, how are you? He's at the tournament. Who? Eli? Eli. Right now is not the time to get psyched out. We are just going to bowl our game. We're not going to overthink it. or try to analyze anything, like... like how we got here, how in the hell Ben is bowling 270. Who cares? Who cares? All right. We're just going to go out there, focus on the pins, and move. All right? Oh, if you're nervous, don't let them see your nerves. Just don't. You know, it's easy, breezy. Easy. Let's do it. If he hits 10 pins, I think it's over. We need a strike to win, kiddo. Uncle Sean. I think my dad's okay with second. Love you, dad. I love you, too, son. I love you, too. Glenn, I have... Hey. I think I'm going to head over to Rick's. OK. I'll head up with Sean. Hey, Bill. Huh? Huh? Hey, I got to go pee. Can, um... Can you hold the cup? Yeah, of course. Not so tough now, are you? Hey, hey, hey! Get off of him. You OK, Eli? What's going on? This guy, he pushed me, dad. Did you touch my kid? I was getting him off my nephew. Don't you ever touch my kid? Then, keep your animal away from him. What did you say? You heard me. Now move. Not until you apologize to my son. It's not going to happen. Then we got a problem. I'm not going to fight you, Tim. Of course not. You'd rather have your brother fight all your battles for you, faggot. Grandpa! There's someone... somebody's hurting Uncle Sean in the bathroom. What the hell? Not such hot stuff now, are you? Get off me! Sorry, Dick. You should have let your fag fight his own fights. Can you drive? Thank you so much. Hello? Can... can you come? Dad? Eli? Dad! Eli! Dad! Dad! Eli! Dad! Eli, what are you doing? It's dad. He's coming back. I... I saw the star, just like in Evie's story... a... a falling star. Oh, Eli. It means that the soul is coming back, mom. He... he's coming back. It's his second chance. Eli, honey. He's not coming back. But I saw the star. Oh, Eli. He's not coming back. But Evie's story... It was just a story. No. No. Yeah. No. But I don't know where he is, mom. OK. I don't know where he is. Eli. Listen to me. You do not have to look for your father, because he is right here. He is with us. He is with you. He is always with you. And I am so sorry that you have had to go through this alone. But I'm here. I'm here now. OK? Mom! Shhh, it's OK. Oh, it's OK. It's OK. It's OK, Eli. Sean? I'm sorry, Sean. So sorry. Nice jeans there, Pinky. Studs for the stud. Hey, Pinky's on the prowl. Why are you calling John, Pinky? It's his new nickname. Show him. Oh my god! Come on, dude. in the game last Saturday, man. This... this safety ruined my finger. Oh, poor baby. You need to go take a nap. I'll see you later, man. See you later. Where did Earl Anthony go? Well, that depends on who you ask. For me, my father's never very far. I see him in the way my grandfather looks at me and calls me kiddo... the way my uncle tells me about the things they did as boys... the way Evie's always there, and in the way my mother plays piano until I fall asleep at night. For the love they shared with him, goes through each of them and back and forth to me... and is and always will be mine. I'm sure what it'll be like when I die. I'm not sure if I'll be scared them or ready to go. I just hope that I see all the places that I want to see, and do all the things that I want to do and that I love all the people that I love, best that I can. And if that happens, I think the hardest part about dying will just be letting go.
