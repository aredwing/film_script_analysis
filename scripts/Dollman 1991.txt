There is no escape. - Stop or we will ruin you. - ... Get away from me! Stop. Stop. Shit. Oh my God, oh my God... I'm so angry with my life! We got him trapped down in the laundromat. But I do not see a thing. According to the building plan, he's only got one exit out of here. All you kids, to the right! - Do not .. do not scream! - NO!! Lady! Quiet! I'm gonna force my foot, see if he's got anybody else down there. Back off! Or I kill the fat lady! I mean it! Try anything! Get these damn fuckers all over the place! Please, rat, why don't you pick on somebody your own size! Ahh, shut up! Headquarters ...we got ourselves a big problem down here. I bespeak further ten million mineral bricks and safe passage out this universe as we know it. The son of a bitch is even crazier than we thought, if he thinks we're gonna give him any of these things. Is exactly what we're going to do, Captain Skyresh. I want this situation resolved now. Give him what he wants and get rid of him. Elections are next week and I don't need dead fat ladies on video screens all over the city. Got it, Mr. Mayor. Just got a better idea. Brick Bardo just showed up. Bardo? I just said I don't want a bloodbath. I'm ordering you to meet his demands. Mayor? Sorry, um... there is a trouble with the phone here. Gotta go. Skyresh... Skyresh! Skyr... Brick, what are you doing here? Good to see you. Hell of a mess. Got in there over thirteen hostages. The mayor wants to give in. I'm suspended, remember? Yeah. But, um... - you've got any ideas? - I've got an idea. Gonna use hot water for my whites... use a cold wash and more rinser for the colors. What are you talking about? Laundry, Captain. This is what I'm doing. Excuse me. So Bricks can take over? Yeah. Right. One... Two... - Three... - Hey asshole! What the fuck you think you're doing? I'm gonna kill these fat ladies! Hey, I am talking to you, sh-shitbrain! Somebody... ...better... get this moron out of here... ...or the fat is going to hit the fan! That's right. One of us outta get goin'. But I already put my money in the machine. I swear. I am going to do it. Wow! That's the Ruger Blaster, the most powerful handgun in the Universe! That's right, fat boy. And it's gonna blow a hole clean through this fat lady. And then blow a hole out of you. And that's gonna blow a hole outta lady behind you. It's gonna be a lot of guts floating around in the laundromat. Do you know what I mean... ...fat boy? What the hell happened to you? Two women in cardiac arrest? Everything is under control. The suspect is in custody. And every news station in town is reporting that one of my officers endangered a laundromat full of hostages. Think how that looks! - Mayor, no one was killed and I thought that Bardo here... - I'll do the thinking, Captain! Where is that son of a bitch now?! Disappointed you didn't get to kill anyone tonight, Bardo? You are through! You goddamn psycho!! Take off those sunglasses, it's night! - I want that bastard suspended! - He is already under suspension because of the incident in Fillmore. Then fire his ass, I want him done! Thank you for saving my Mom. Tonight, at 11:68, there was a extreme shootout in a South Central laundromat. Unidentified sources at the crime scene claim that a renegade ex-cop went on a shooting rampage that has left an unconfirmed 27 bystanders wounded and another 3.6 dead. With more on this tragic fast breaking story are Details are still sketchy at this point, Harry. However, anonymous official has heard rumor that 1.4 of the dead are indeed children. The Mayor's office has released no actual details at this time. However, a highly placed authority has implied the identity of the killer to be known. The name 'Brick Bardo' was overheard. Brick Bardo. Isnt he the detective that was involved in the Fillmore incident earlier this year? - That's right, Harry - - Well come back to this late breaking story ...But first: we've got a travel advisory for you from Tricia LaBelle There's an old friend... Wants to see you, Bard. Rise and shine. I saw the news tonight. You're a very violent man, Bardo. Yes, I know. It's a violent universe. I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me. I am seeing the last of you, Spruge. After our last encounter, this is all they managed to salvage. Let's see if I can remember the first time. The Conklin bank job? - I blew off your left arm. - And most of my left foot. And then there was the Space Extortion. What did I take? Two... or three legs? Among other things. The last time, All I remember was your head, rolling around in the parking lot. I didn't think there was enough to save. Modern medicine. Theyre doing some wonderful things. It's too bad your lovely family couldn't benefit as I have. Then I think, even our best doctors couldn't have done anything with what was left of them. What do you want? I'll tell you what I want, Bardo. 50,000 molecular ions. And I get them too, you know why? Because my cruiser is loaded with a dimensional fusion bomb, that will blow the atoms of this city into another universe unless they pay up. Itll never happen. Why not? Somehow you'll fuck it up. You always fuck it up. No, Bardo. You've always screwed up my plans. But this time you won't have a chance, because youre gonna be it tiny, tiny little atoms. Were gonna blow you apart, piece by piece, Bardo. It's mine now. I've heard about this custom-made monster for years. Do not worry, Bardo. I'll take good care of him. And I'll put it to good use. Start with his left hand. How does it feel to be on the other side, Bardo? I don't know. You tell me. I'm gonna die. You can't kill me anymore. What do you want, asshole? Nothing. Youre just gonna walk away? Warning. Intruder is following you. Closing fast. Your crap won't take the pressure. Neither will yours. Damn! I don't give a fuck. What makes you think I do? Warning: Energy Band impact. Warning: you have landed on an alien planet. Air pressure and atmosphere compatible to human life.

Alone! Where is he? Looks just like it's his! Oh fuck! - Thats about the size of it. - No! Jesus Christ... Oh fuck... A little paint and you'd be just like brand new. Youre worlds just as violent as ours, isn't it? But things don't change. People don't. I'm gonna lose, aren't I? Only if you give up, lady. Thanks. Mommy! Mommy! What is it, honey? Oh, baby...

You promise to help me. I want that help now, tonight. It's too dangerous here and I'm tired of being small. I want my ship repaired... and I want to leave, fast. Do we have understanding? Yo, whatever you say. Just fucking do it! Hey, youre pretty fucking good! Hey... ...you promise me a bomb. First show it to me, or there's no deal. It's right behind me. All you do... ...is push the button. Ten seconds later... Boom! Everything within three parsecs is sent to another dimension forever. But that's for later. After you've done everything I need. From now on, you work for me. - You do what I say. - Work for you? You're In the wrong fucking neighborhood, deadhead. Call hommies together, we're going to war. - With who? - With the fucking doll, man, who else? But we heard he just popped Jackson and the other guy, he almost killed you. So the fuck what? We got a dimensional bomb. We gonna settle this fucker once and for all. The fuckin demenial bomb. If you're cold, you can put this on. It's warm. No, thanks. Alright. So, do you have a family back home? - Not anymore. - But you used to? Mind if I get a little sleep? Sorry. Good night. I had a wife and two kids. Baby girl... ...a boy about Kevin's age. Someone who wanted to hurt me, did it by hurting them. Kevin's father is dead, too. He was shot, holding up a liquor store, 8 years ago. Kevin doesn't even remember him. He was a gangbanger, Brooklyn Homeboy. And at the time I thought... ...Homeboy was as cool as you can get. And then when Kevin was born, he swore he was done with gangs, done with crime. But... he lied. I don't know, it's like... ...in this neighborhood gangs are the only way you can be noticed, its the only way you can be somebody. And they give you a new name, and then you are Shorty, or Sleepy, or Psycho... and gangs give you an identity. You wouldn't know how hard it is keeping Kevin away... his friends already belong... Hes trying but ...I'm gonna lose him if I don't do something about it. So why don't you leave? Where... would I go? I don't have any money, I can't even pay the rent. Dropped out of school to have Kevin. Besides, this is my home. This is where I grew up, everything I've ever known is here. I'm not gonna run away. You've got a lot of guts. lady. But maybe you're using the wrong approach. What do you mean? Fight fire with fire. I always thought you fought fire with water? Some fires are too big. Kevin, leave him alone. Kev, get your gear, you're late. Have a good day at school. Be careful. I love you. Bye. Oh, hi. Here is my number at work, in case you need to call. I don't think going to work is such a great idea, if those punks will be looking for you. Well, if I don't go to work, I don't get paid. If I don't get paid, I can't pay the rent. And there is nothing to eat, so... I'm going to work. I think you should stay in, though. The world isn't safe for someone your size. I'll be home at 7. - Kevin will be home around 3:30. - Look, lady, I'm gonna find the rest of these punks... ...and finish this. No, you're not. Got to do what I got to do, lady. Be careful out there, Debi. So you're trying to tell me that a 13-inch man saved your ass from Braxton? Yes. I thought it was like a hallucination or something that I must... I mean... I don't know, what I'm gonna do with him. Ah, a 13-inch man. Are you sure it wasnt a dream? I'm serious. Come over tonight and see him for yourself. Id love to see a 13-inch man... You know what I mean... I dont know where he came from... ...and what to do about What's so funny, ladies? Nothing's funny, sir. Nothing's funny about toxic waste, Mr. Wilmar. Well, then get back to wooork! You're way behind! Sheesh. What's his problem? Hmm, he asked me out to that Guns 'n' Roses concert. I told him I dont dig the mutant slime from work. - You didn't! - Yeah! What the fuck are we waiting for? Were waitin because I said were waitin. Im gonna cut an example out of this bitch. Well, it's about time. Fuck, man. What's the matter? - Oh, fuck! - Yo, I thought that little guy fixed you. I hope he didn't go home. Not without his ship. You know, there does not seem to be much structural damage. Maybe if I just adjust this...orhow about Back away, Gerald. I think he suffers from a Napoleonic Syndrome. - What?! Short man's complex. So... how long do you think this guy gonna stay at your place? I don't know. I don't know. His spaceship doesn't work, so he can't really go anywhere. - Guess he's stuck here. - You want him to stay though, don't you? Seora Alejandro? Ah, seora Rodriguez, Que tal? - Bien, oiga!.. ...I heard about this doll-man. ...that he blew away Braxton's Red Homies last night, es eso cierto? Yeah, it's true. Oiga! E cuando Se next meeting of Neighborhood Watch? Thursday, 7:30 at the cafeteria. - I'll be there! - Really? - Si! Vivian, you know we can make a difference. We can change this neighborhood. Especially with this doll-man blowing away all the scumbags for us, eh? That's not the way I wanted this to work out. - Alright girlfriend. - See ya. Be by later to see your doll-man. Braxton! Ah! Leave me alone! - Or what? Your little friend gonna come out here and beat me up, huh? Help! Somebody, help! - Put her in the car! - We'll gonna stop you, you son of a bitch! Get away! Alla Ya!! Knock it off! - Kevin, where's the doll? - Braxtons got your mom downstairs. Kevin, get out of the way! Keep your eye out for the doll-man, OK? cause he's gonna come looking for her. Hey, can you spare a smoke, man? Sit down. Stop this, Braxton. You're hurt. The fuck do you care? Yeah... Don't even think about it! Braxton, youre gonna die if you don't get some help. - So I die. - But you can stop this before you go down. When you gonna get hip to what's going on here? Huh? Were all gonna go down, Debi, because that's the way the man wants it. Can't you see that? Huh? You think they care about you? You think they care about Dalton Avenue, huh? They don't give a shit. You're on the wrong fucking side. Sit down. Don't make me get up. Fucking SIT DOWN!! What the fuck are we fucking waiting for? I mean. fuck this shit! Fuck, man, the fucker who set-up this, is fucked-up! The little fucker knows what kind of fuckin shit is fuckin waiting here so fuck him up! So let's get the fuck out of this fucking deal - Does fucking anybody seen anything yet? - Nothing yet. Come on down here. Fuck it! Braxton, man, it's been three hours. He ain't gonna show. He must have found out whats waiting for him. Ahh, fuck him. I'm cruising, you go looking, huh? Come on, go on. OK, Jimmer, the punks a no show, so we're out of here. The van will meet us down here. Over. Got it, homie. And I thought this would gonna be hard. Hey, Jimmer! Jimmer, man, where the fuck are you? Get down here! We're ready to roll! What the fuck is going on there?

No, let's see this like for you, motherfucker. - Stand aside, lady. Let me finish this. - It's finished. - Come on, it's finished. Don't you see that? - He's scum. He doesnt deserve to live. Because your family isn't alive, is that it? Come on, let it go. Just let it go. - Stand aside. - Okay... Don't do it for me! Okay, lady. You win. Wrong. Nobody fuckin wins. Dimensional fusion bomb. Run! Run! So Debi, tell me size doesn't count.
