At said location on 16 September 1954 furniture will be impounded from Adelina Sbaratti... My wife. the consignee, due to lack of payment of a 28,000-lire fine. With procedural fees, interest and costs, etc. It brings us to 50,780. Wasn't it better to pay 28,000? Well? Well, are you going to pay this 50,780? You kidding? We didn't pay 28 and you expect us to pay 50? - Where's the consignee? - My wife? Yes, the consignee. She's not here. Doesn't matter. If you don't pay, I'll take the furniture. Come in, sir. Let's see now. One walnut table, six feet by four feet... So, you cleared everything out. It's out of my hands now. This is a matter for the courts. Make way! We fooled him! He wanted Adelina Sbaratti? He can shove it! That's all you know, lewd gestures, threats. Where do you think that will that get you? You're in a real fix and at your own hands! - What's he after? - He came on Wednesday. - Who is he? - Search me. I'm Verace, a lawyer, and you're illiterate clowns! That was no joke. A fine mess you've made. You'll see when the police come. You'll go to jail for the crime you committed. What crime? My friend, you violated article 384 of the criminal code. That's what you did! Hey, Mr. Lawyer! Explain it to us, we're ignorant. First you get yourself into trouble, then you come to us lawyers. But it was only a fine. Which you didn't pay, so they impounded your furniture. And then you came up with the brilliant idea of hiding it. The fine was almost 30,000 lire! Sir, my friend is not very well off. What did they fine him for? Selling contraband cigarettes. I'm truly sorry, my friend, but I must tell you you're in big trouble. But it's not me, it's my wife, a mother of children! They fined her. The furniture's hers, the lease is in her name. Then she'll go to jail. Don't let him get away. Pasquale, call Adelina! Hey, Mr. Lawyer! Mr. Lawyer. - Get out of here, get lost. - But she's a mother of children! Cigarettes! English, American, Swiss! Let's see if I can catch a customer. English, American, Swiss! Who smokes? Sir, I buy dollars. Get out of here. Adelina, only you can persuade the lawyer. Come right now! - What lawyer? - What is she supposed to do? The bailiff came, and a lawyer says we're in trouble. What kind of trouble? Those idiots! Oh, my God! Hey, come here, boy! - Come see the lawyer! - And let everything burn? You go, we'll take care of the boy. - What about my box? - You'll find it as you left it. The damn idiots! Swiss cigarettes? American, French, English. Hey, a client! That gentleman's mine. English, American, Swiss... - But ma'am - Get out! They're going! If he says something, that's because it's true. If he said he can't help you, he can't help you. He wouldn't miss out on good business. But maybe he just says that because he's angry. - Get out! - They're going! I've told you once, please go away. If you let us see him, there's something in it for you too. On my word of honor, I never saw two more deceitful people! Hey, you. Go get it. I won't budge from here. - Carmine. - Finally. Come in. Who are you? Where are you going? - That way. - Let's go. What do you mean? You can't go in, don't you get it? Pasquale, Amedeo. Where is he? Mr. Lawyer, help us! She can't go to jail! What jail? I was fined for selling cigarettes. You know how long it takes to make 28,000 lire? Days, weeks even. I'm always out there, rain or shine. You know how long my husband's been out of work? Ever since he completed his military service! How can we get by? How will my child eat? Then some creep comes along and arrests you. No, wait a minute. They can't arrest her. What do you mean? She's expecting. They can't arrest her, she's expecting! They can't arrest her, get it? She's expecting. They can't jail her for that crime. - Why? - She's expecting. Have you heard? They can't arrest her. Why not? - She's expecting. - Yes, she's expecting. She's expecting! She's expecting! She's expecting? Yes, she's expecting. She's expecting, she's expecting. She's expecting, cha-cha-cha. She's expecting, she's expecting. She's expecting, cha-cha-cha. She's expecting! Good morning. Congratulations! Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations, Adelina. I have an American specialty, painless childbirth. - Good luck! - Same to you. Good for you. Here they are, nice and fresh. - Put it on my tab. - Okay. Oh boy, they're hot! - The lawyer should know. - Dig in. When a woman is pregnant, she can't be arrested... until six months after the baby is born. She's entitled to six months for nursing. Watch it! Kids are a great thing, a gift of providence... although I've never had the pleasure. Is that my fault? I've got what it takes. But let's not broach this painful topic for God's sake. But that's not the point. I'm only saying that the best thing in the world is when a man comes home and his wife says she wants a baby. Heart, ungrateful heart Well, what's the joke? - I was doing my military service - No, let me tell it. We were 17, right? And we were going together, and well, the inevitable happened. ''Carmine, how can I tell Mama?'' This idiot was all happy. ''Are you really sure?'' ''Yes. I know a midwife. I'll go see her tonight.'' ''But I can't get leave.'' I say, ''If it's positive, I'll come sing 'Ungrateful Heart' outside the barracks.'' So that's it. All that night: Heart, ungrateful heart I didn't sleep a wink. As soon as I got out of the service we were married. Mama was against it. ''Adelina, my girl, I can't give you a cent. Carmine's flat broke. I had 15 kids. What if you take after me?'' ''Mama, we'll be careful.'' But you didn't keep your word and now you're pregnant again. Yes, just look at it. I could have gone to jail. The baby's due any day. A short rest. July, August, September, November, December. Carmine, you'll have to get busy at Christmas. I have no choice. Otherwise... - Right. - Here I am. - Merry Christmas! - Thank you. - Good night. Merry Christmas! - Thank you. Well, Mama, good night. Merry Christmas. Christmas on my own. You have things to do. - Mama, I explained. - I understand. But we'll have dinner together tomorrow. Enrico. Oh, I nearly forgot. Grandma made some ointment for your chilblains. Do you put it on at night? Yes, rub it on when he's in bed. Thanks, Mama. See you tomorrow. Take care. Merry Christmas again. Adelina. Carmine. Come and celebrate with us. Amedeo's brought a big cake from Milan. Come on. They're all waiting for you. - Pasquale, I'm sorry. - It's Christmas. I don't want to go to jail. Oh, I get it. You'll have a better Christmas than us. Stop that! Get moving! Who lives here? Adelina Sbaratti. I'm here. Come in. Adelina, the term's up. It's time for your vacation. You're under arrest. - What does that mean? - The doctor's certificate is on the table. If you want it, help yourself. Or come back in a few months, and you'll find two of them. Heart, ungrateful heart Congratulations. See how well he's learned? English, American, Swiss. Swiss! How cute he is! The cops. The cops! Go ahead, arrest me! I have another five months. Arrest me. Roasted chestnuts, come and get 'em! Eat up, they're hot! - 50 lire's worth of chestnuts. - Right away. Sorry, I have to ask the usual favor. Here you are. Right, let's see. Here. Forget it, for a few chestnuts. Thank you. - I can't make it out. - But you wrote it. The best I could. Darn reading and writing. ''Delivered on October 28.'' I was selling prickly pears back then. Six months' nursing. October, November, December, January, February, March, April. Her reprieve ends in May, when cherries come out. It's January now. There's time. Carmine, If you need any help, feel free. Pasquale, If you need a baby, I do house calls! If not tonight, then tomorrow night. Two pounds of cherries for the lady. Cherries! Cherries! A couple of cherries for her. - The certificate? - The certificate. - Another child? - Another child. That's four. How many more? I'll take as many as God will give me! Heart, ungrateful heart Maria! Don't be late! And take the umbrella. - All right, Mama. - Thank you, ma'am. Come back, you rascals! Get back here this minute! Where do you think you're going? It's about to rain. Don't worry, if it starts raining I'll stand in a doorway. You kids... Open wide, here comes the fuel. My turn, my turn! Have they finished, Pasquale? It's all gone. Look! Make me a pacifier for Caterina. Coming right up. Okay, okay, I hear you. I'll make the pacifier later. Let me quiet the kids down first. Come here, kids. Uncle Pasquale's got something for you. Easy now, one at a time. Hey, one at a time. One for you, one for you... And we'll keep these for later. Now be good while Uncle Pasquale makes a pacifier for Caterina. Nunziatina, let me tie a bow in your hair. You must have a bow. Hey, no bow, no candy. Where's Carmine? Carmine? He's in a bad way. With seven kids it's a regular fanfare all night. I sent him off to Mama's this morning to get an hour of sleep. And he's still there. How pretty you look. Now Uncle Pasquale will give you some more candy. Here you are. The fanfare seems to do you good though. You're prettier than ever now, bless you. Kids are good for me. Some women fall apart after the first. But not me. Look. - Seven kids. - Lucky you. The cough medicine, I forgot. - I won't take it. - Yes, you will. We aren't aristocrats. The medicine was bought so it must be used. I won't take it. Yes, you will. Come here. Come here or I'll kill you! Not like that. You have to be nice. Let me try. Come out! Come to Uncle Pasquale. Up yours! Is that any way to talk to your Uncle Pasquale? Come on. What did he do? He bit my hand. It's nothing. I'll fix him. He'll come out. Get out from under there. I've got him! Hold him tight. Don't let him go. You're gonna take this or my name isn't Adelina Sbaratti. - I won't take it! - Oh yes, you will! We can't throw money out the window like that. For a tantrum! 400 lire! What are you doing? You're going to hurt yourselves. Shoo, shoo! Come on now, out you go! Get out of here! Here, buy yourselves a lollipop. Come on, go! Out, out! I'll send them to school. I've had it. Come here, you cutie-pie. Come to bed like a good girl. Adelina, she has to eat something. What do you mean? She had two plates of pasta. Put her to bed. She's fast asleep already. All right, then. Here you go. This is red hot. I'd keep you company, but I have things to do. Off you go, and thank you. What a good father you'd make. Pasquale! Are you crazy? I'm sorry. I got a bit carried away. I'm sorry. I can't, Mama. I can't. Can't you hear them? I came here to sleep. Have a word with Don Antonio. My son, they have to work. I pay next to nothing in rent. Don Antonio, will you be long? Another 10 minutes, then we break for lunch. And after that you'll go on hammering? Don't worry. We'll let Carmine get an hour's sleep. Thank you. And please... How long do I have to wait for this jerk? ''I'll be there at 9:00.'' It's 10:30 and he hasn't shown up. At last! Get a move on! Took you long enough. Come on. - I've come from Porta Capuana. - So? - I've come from Porta Capuana. - Come on, it's this way. Come in, hurry up. Hear me, saints, bless this lovely house. In name of the archangel Gabriel. Let this be a house of fertility. My wife's name is Pina... No, over here on the bed. You want a boy or a girl? A boy, girl, twins, whatever. As long as it's a sure thing. Sure as can be, but that costs 50 lire extra. All right. - Okay, ring the bell. - Now? Tomorrow? - Where does your husband sleep? - Here. Ring the bell. Hear me, Saint Nicholas. Fortune is still sleeping. In the name of your blood. In good fortune, or bad, I'm invoking fruitfulness for this woman's womb. Hear me, saints, grant this woman's wish. I can't take it anymore! You're right, my dear. You must look after yourself. The first thing is sleep. I'll make you some chamomile tea. Mama, chamomile? I've been in a living hell for three years and you give me chamomile? What a calamity. Always the same old song. ''Carmine, get busy! Carmine, the nursing term's over! Carmine, go to bed early! Carmine, turn out the light!'' And all on one bowl of soup a day. I'm not made of iron. Doing it now and then is one thing, but this is nonstop. You do look peaked. Of course I do. Dizzy spells that come and go, wobbly legs. And If you must know, I've fainted twice in the street. And the more of a wreck I become, the stronger she gets. How pretty she's become, Mama. She's blossomed like a rose. She's bleeding you dry, destroying you. You've become just as ugly as an ape. Let that rose get someone else to give her a big belly. I'll kill her... if something like that happens. Carmine... - Maria! - She's sleeping! Carmine, give me a hand! One chicken, two pounds of pasta and two bottles of wine. 100 lire. - What number? - Give me 89. Who wants a number? Buy a lottery ticket! Darn it. I was dead certain this time. Two weeks! I even made an appointment with the doctor for the certificate. And instead I feel lousy. I guess I'm not used to it anymore. Here he comes. Well? Beat it. What do you mean? I mean I was late and there's no baby. What can I do about that? What can I do about that? Are you trying to send the poor girl to jail? - Me? - Yes, you! - How could you think such a thing? - That's what we think. You could learn a thing or two from my husband. You may go in. Thank you. Come in. Have a seat. Sorry to bother you, but I always give you fresh cigarettes. So I thought you'd return the favor and give me special treatment. Of course. - How's business? - I can't complain. What is this about? Carmine, you're the man. You should tell him. He's shy. A doctor is like a confessor. Doctor, I Ever since we got married, it's been nonstop. My God, there's never even been a letup in this current. Seven kids and I'm still nursing. It's not my fault, Doctor. The will is there. You bet. We married for love. It's obvious the will was there. But if this goes on, who will provide for the kids? He's out of work. I have to provide for everyone, dear sir. I understand. Your wife's right. Sure, but I'm right too. We aren't animals. Your wife is pretty, you're in love. But you ought to control yourself, my boy. It's not that I don't feel the urge. I do feel it. Stifle it. So you don't want any more children? No, it's just the opposite, Doctor. But this guy... he's broken. Just a minute. The urge is there. Excuse me. I don't understand. What is it you want? Another child! God bless you! So you came to have your husband examined? Yes, sir. Come over here then. Sit down here. Take your jacket off. - The urge is there. - I feel the urge too. Cross your legs. His leg reacts, it moves. What do I care if his leg moves? You're slightly anemic. Let's check your blood pressure. There's nothing wrong with your husband. He's just very tired. He's undernourished. Is it serious, Doctor? Of course not. There's no need to worry. It's a very minor thing. - His pressure is 80. - Eighty? - Is that good? - No, bad, Adelina. He's run down. What should he do? You should let him be. You don't whip a tired horse. You put him in the stable. Let him be for two or three months. Meanwhile, he'll take treatment, he'll eat nourishing food, and you'll have the baby next year. Adelina, good afternoon. Look at this. I brought the medicine for Carmine. Good. What is it? Injections, some German stuff. Don't listen to the doctor. The pharmacist says this is special. After a month of these whoppers- Look how big they are. Carmine will turn into a lion! In a month I'll be in jail. Don't say that, Adelina. ''Diseases of the para lina hepati-'' What does that mean? ''Make sure to distinguish... between the right-'' Pasquale, come here. Better you than someone else. Adelina... I don't want to go to jail, get it? I won't go. You go around saying you've got what it takes. Show me. Now? Now. Here? Here. Adelina. Sweetheart. Yes. - But where's Carmine? - He's at Mama's with the kids. Only Nunziatina and Caterina are here. Come on then. - Oh, Adelina. - Oh, my God. - Pasquale, leave off! - Do anything you like. I can't do it. I can't. I want my Carmine. What the hell? I don't understand you. What do you think I am, a clown? You wanted it and we'll do it. Shame on you! A fine friend of my husband you are. But it was you! Yes, it was me! Are you crazy? My God. Poor little girls. Wake up, girls. The German stuff. - Wake up, Mama's taking you to jail. - To jail? Yes, to jail! I'm a fool to love you. I'll go to jail and that's that. We'll put an end to this farce. Good-bye. Bye, darlings. Keep away, don't touch me! Good-bye, sissy! Look at the baby! - Which one's free? - The first. What are you doing? This one goes to the maternity section. Come with me. Why are you taking her away? - What's your name? - Nunziatina. Dear Nunziatina. She's adorable. Nunziatina. - Good morning, Mother. - Good morning, girls. Come here. Sit on the bed. Like that. Good girl. Here's the pot. - A change of baby clothes. - Thank you, Mother. - Hey, I know you. - I know you too. You're Adelina from Forcella. - Of course, you're Fragulella. - Yes, I'm Fragulella. - What's your name? - Assuntia. - And you? - Pizzoca. - What are you in for? - Fraud. What's your name? Earthquake. What you in for? - Abuse. - Of the cops. - And you, Fragulella? - Prostitution. Aren't you going to ask me? - What's your name? - Big tits! What are you in for? Insulting an officer. Well done. Come on, eat up. You've had nothing all day. - Are they fresh? - Sure. - Plus the tax for Adelina's fine. - What can we do? Shave and a haircut, 450. I've always paid 350. - And the tax for the fine? - Oh, yeah. Were you looking for me? Cleopatra, remember the tax for the fine. Yes, I know. Don't bother, I'll pay. Give me the change. Three beers today and two orangeades yesterday. Here. - Thank you. - Thank you, Sergeant. He paid the tax for the fine too. That's 40,690 lire. Do you want to count it? Is there any hope of collecting the full amount? an eight-day remission of the jail term. Lawyer, in a week, two weeks at most... I'll bring you here on this table 300,000 lire and even more! Are you sure? Look, the people of Forcella are out of this world! They've risen up in a gesture of solidarity. I must say, it almost makes you forget how filthy and ignorant they are. Be quiet, my dear sister! Heart Ungrateful heart You've stolen my life away Sister! - What is it, Sbaratti? - My husband is here. - But it's not allowed. - Please. But quietly. Quietly, I say. The things you make me do! - I'm sorry. - Quietly. Heart There she is! Start singing. Tell her the kids are fine. I love her and the petition for pardon has been sent off to Rome. My dear The kids are fine Carmine is always thinking of you And the petition for pardon has already been sent My dear He swears it's been sent Carmine has always loved you So good evening, and good night Come in, the lawyer is expecting you. Come in. - Good morning, counselor. - The illustrious gentleman. - How are you? - Nice to see you. Counselor, is it true that the full amount has been collected? Here it is, and even more. This sum, sir, will buy her- A 64-day remission of the sentence. So the case is closed? No, the conviction remains, but I've applied for a pardon. Your name is Verace? Domenico Verace. I'm Bianchina Verace, sister of the lawyer. Okay. I've petitioned the president for a pardon, but it takes time. Counsel, how long was her sentence? Almost four and a half months. Gentlemen, the press can do a lot to mobilize public opinion and solicit the authorities, because unless a pardon comes at once, it's no good. I can never do right. Why aren't you pleased? - For a few days off jail? - Am I the Attorney General? - You're a pig, that's what! - A pig? The fine is paid. Yes, sir. But who'll serve the rest of the sentence? Don't make me laugh. You know what they say in here? They never grant pardons. Amnesty is different. I have to serve the full four months, but you're all right, you're outside! - Oh, come on! - Calm down, young man. You can't imagine what an urge I have. It's killing me! I can't wait for you to get out. - I've finished the treatment. - Oh, shut up! That's just talk. When I needed actions, you ran off to Mama. You came over dizzy. Beat it! A pardon! Some hope! As if they cared about me in Rome! I don't want to see you again! Adelina. Sbaratti. Natali', what is it? Good news, sister. - Sbaratti! - I'm here. What is it? What happened? You've been pardoned. You're free! My God. I don't believe it. Pardoned? Yes, the news came last night, but the warden wanted to make sure. Pardoned? I've been pardoned! I'm free! Fragulella, I'm free! Come here. I'm so happy. Don't forget about us when you get out. - Say hello to my mother. - Come and see me. - Carmine and the kids will be so happy. - I'm going to eat them all up! - Pardoned. - Sbaratti. If you want to leave with the first shift, be quick. What time is it? It's 11:00. There's so much to do. Papa, when's Mama coming out? You heard the lawyer. We have to wait. Will they let her out now? Let's hope so. Stop it! Behave yourselves or they won't let Mama out. What? When you go to jail, will you take me with you? Mr. Verace's waiting in the visitor's room. He says to hurry. She'll be there in five minutes. As soon as we're all dressed. It's 12:00. What do you think, Mr. Mellino? Will your wife make it out with the first shift? - Stop it! - There's Mama! Idiot, you made my heart turn over. I thought it was her. Isn't this the most exciting day of your life? It sure is. Did the news take you by surprise? No, I was ready for it. Were the kids pleased? They were bursting with happiness. They were all yelling. ''Our mother is coming back!'' They were singing and dancing. - Papa, I'm tired. - I'm hungry. I have to pee! They're too young to understand, poor things. Of course, and it's a long wait. How will you show your gratitude to the president? By writing him a letter from me and my wife. - There's Mama! - Stop it or I'll smack you. Wait! Wait for me! What can I say? I don't know anything. Watch out for the streetcar! Are you trying to kill me? Driver, over here! The car is ready. Are we going by car? Come on, children. One at a time. Your pardon guaranteed in 15 days. Pay one third up front and the rest when the pardon is granted. Aren't you coming in? Pardon guaranteed, you look worried. PETITIONS FOR PARDON ACCEPTED Carnations are 80 lire apiece. What good are flowers? You can have 'em. - Oh, come on. - Here. - Look, look! - Pardon guaranteed in 15 days. Pay one third up front and the rest when the pardon is granted. All thanks to you! Hurrah for Forcella! You look wonderful! Enrico, come here. Go see who it is. - Who is it? - It's Fortunata. We're going to the port. The cigarettes have come. What should I do? Fortuna', it's my first day of freedom and it was my first night after a long time. - I want to stay in. - Yes, stay here. - So we'll see you tomorrow? - Yeah, I'm taking the day off. See you tomorrow at the usual spot. Don't worry. Mr. Verace has promised to fix me up. - Okay. - Bye. They're gone. - Mama. - Come to Mama. Help, I'm drowning! Open this window, lovely fairy As the air has become full of perfume You're still sleeping full of courage Roses, what lovely roses It's May again Ugh, you can't get around even early in the morning... That's right, dears! By all means, take your time. Why don't they stay home in bed, these workers? At least on Sunday morning. In three days, the concert. Two hours of sleep guaranteed. Thank goodness. Tomorrow morning, it's the Senator's funeral. I absolutely must put in an appearance. At 10:00, the Patronesses Committee meeting. Lunch with the in-laws. The Americans in the evening. The next morning... The next morning? Oh, yes, Father Astolfi's orphans. Then the hairdresser's. Drop by Titti's. Then an hour at the gym. Then back to the hairdresser. Then stop by Titti's again. And then the awards of prizes to those wretched orphans. Enough, enough! Away! A clean break. Once and for all. Renzo, I can't remember the color of your eyes right now. The darling, with that serious face. He's the best man I know. So generous, so free, so unassuming. The darling... with those incredible short socks. There he is. Right there. Hi. Hi. - Am I late? - No, I just got here. - Where shall we go? - No idea. You decide. It's hot in here. Mind if I put down the top? No. Were you surprised I called? No, I was expecting it. I'd have called If you hadn't. If you've got the time, how about a drive? Sure. I have all the time you want. - Isn't that your husband? - Yes. Where is he now? In Stuttgart for the EEC. He'll be away for another week. How does it feel, seeing your name everywhere? I don't even notice anymore. Besides, my name is Anna. Don't you remember? Really, Renzo, you've changed since last night. You hardly know me. No. It's just that when I saw you arrive, it took my breath away. Classy, eh? Renzo. After you took me home last night, I couldn't sleep. The things you said to me. I don't think I've ever felt so unhappy. - Why? - Because you're right. I've lived like a puppet, deaf, blind, oblivious... to the rights of others. I realized it suddenly while I was dancing with you. I felt alive for the first time, in your arms. What's this world coming to? Let's close the roof. - Are you scared someone might see you? - No, I said it for your sake. Besides, it could happen. If you're worried about my husband, you can relax. Sounds like it bothers you. Nobody likes living with an addict. I didn't know. Yes, an addict. Not in the way you think, but it's worse. He's like a cog in the wheel: Work, success, money. Money, success, work. He can't stop. And there's no room for anything else. Are you any different? I am different. I've realized it thanks to you. Thank you, Renzo. No, no. I think I talked a lot of nonsense last night. Watch where you're going! Why, what's changed? Anna, how many millions do you have? What does that have to do with it? A lot. You're mean. Hey, slow down! Would you like to drive? Go on, Renzo, you drive. No, I don't know these cars. My limit is a Fiat 600. But this one's really easy, you'll see. No, I'd better not. Come on, Renzo. Let's change places. - Come on. - But It's perfect, you'll see. It does 120 like it's nothing. And it just got a tune-up. The key is there. Go. Where's the turn signal? Oh, here it is. A little music? Well, Renzo? Anna, I like you a lot. But you don't think I'm sincere, do you? I don't know. I don't know. Look, the gas gauge is in the red. No, that's the heat. I filled it up this morning. - How much does it hold? - Twenty gallons, I guess. Gosh, with that much I could go around the world in my car. Do you like traveling? So do I. The minute I can, I go far away from everything. I'm so tired of my world, the people I know. There's an oasis in Africa, near Marrakesh. It's divine. You live on sun and fruit, lots of fruit. - 1,200,000. - What? - Oh, Renzo, stop it. - It's the truth. The truth is you keep turning the conversation to money! You act as if it were my fault. Anna, you know how much I make a month? No, I don't want to know. Don't you get it? I like you precisely because you're different. Unlike those robots I know, busy making money all day. You write, you're intelligent. I never think about money, Renzo. I swear I don't. Because you have it. What am I supposed to do, throw it out the window? Yes, throw it all away: Money, cars, jewelry, those Cleopatra bracelets. I got these at the hardware store. Did you get this hunk of steel at the hardware store as well? But that's not it. The fact is you have money in your veins. In me there's only emptiness, a profound emptiness. I thought you could help me, Renzo. Where do you want to go? - We could go to my place. - Your place? My villa's near here. There's a lake too. - Where? What lake? -Just a little one. My husband had it made for trout fishing. - We'll go to the River Po. - Lovely! What's there? Mosquitoes. At least that's something your husband didn't make. Sorry. Let's go anywhere. Wherever you like. As long as there's a little peace and quiet. There, look. Stop. That's fine. How wonderful. Our jazz program continues... In a few days, this lovely October will be over as well. Hey, get a load of that! Not here, please. Let's go. That's right, stick it to the lady! My God. You like me. I can tell. Anna, If you hadn't called me this morning, who would you have called? Nobody. Nobody. I'm alone. With all the people you know? With all the people I know. I can't tell which are your fingers and which are mine. This is so lovely, Renzo, unbelievable. - I - Renzo, help me. Let's go far away, to the sun. To Rome, Naples. Yes, let's go. We'll arrive at night, in the lamplight. The still, silky water We'll ride in a carriage and find a nice small place, just for us. The dark sky, full of stars. And music, lots of music in the air through the streets under our windows. Tomorrow we'll wake up late as the sun creeps into bed and over your eyes. You'll take me in your arms and caress me. You'll hold me so tight. - Anna, are you hurt? - No, it's nothing. We're on fire! The car! My God, what have you done? Nothing, I had to brake... Something's burning! Oh, God, the tire's burning! Do something, you fool! The car's on fire! Find something to put it out! How could anyone be so stupid! Are you crazy, with my fur? Use your jacket. My God, the whole thing's going to blow up. The jack, get the jack! Oh, God. It's wrecked, ruined. - What are you doing? - I can't open it. Jesus Christ. The jack, I said! Surely you know what a jack is! You must have slammed on the brakes like a brute! These cars are delicate. They're jewels. Jewels! You slam on the brakes like it was a truck! But I could've killed that kid! Who cares about that idiot? Now what are you doing? Taking a break? Excuse me. Would you please give me a hand? I'm in trouble. I think it's something serious. If I can be of any help. What's the matter? I don't know. Please come have a look. What happened? Nothing. We were speeding and suddenly we had to brake hard to swerve. Now it's jammed and I don't know what to do. - It's a Rolls. - Yes, the latest model. - Are you happy with it? - Yes, no problem until now. That's quite a blow. Were you driving? It was all so sudden. The car swerved and went off the road. Strange, these cars are perfect. Yes, I was a fool to let a Fiat-600 driver take the wheel. - A colossal mistake. - You're quite right. - Would you like me to help? - Goodness, no. You see, these cars with the rim-braking system I've always preferred disk brakes. They're better. It's not about the brakes. It's knowing how to drive the car. Even The Divine Comedy in the hands of an illiterate person - Get it? - Indeed. Well, let's hope for the best. Don't worry. Fortunately, the damage can easily be fixed. - Haven't we met? - You look familiar too. I guess we met in Casorate, with my husband, at the Martins'. Is your husband in Milan? No, he's in Stuttgart on EEC business. He'll be away for another week. Thank heavens, with this disaster. Well, you'd better call a mechanic. Definitely, since that guy is absolutely useless. If you'd like, I can turn around and drive you home. Please allow me. I'm Giorgio Carate. That's very kind of you. Thank you. Hey, I'm going home. The gentleman's taking me. We'll send a mechanic right away. Bye. Bye. Oh, keep an eye on it for me, would you? Thanks. Milan Stock Exchange rates. Alimentari: Molini Certosa 2700. Distillati: 2490. Eridania: 2603. Esercizio Molini: 1750. Bye! Is this a Rolls Royce? Does it really do 150? More than a Ferrari! What do you want? Hello? Yes, I was in the bathroom. No, I can't today. Sorry, I'm busy. I have to go to my mother's. No, not next week either. I just can't. Okay. Bye. Watch out, Umberto! Careful with your feet. You'll scare them. Why, oh why Do you always leave me alone on Sundays To go and watch the soccer game Why, oh why Why don't you take me with you just once But one day I'll follow you Because I have doubts that keep me awake at night And if I find out... Oh, the Bolognese! Come in! Darling, sweetheart! Girl of unending beauty! Girl of infinite beauty! You're a garden of loveliness. Mara! Quiet! Keep your voice down! - Mara, you're a garden of loveliness. - Come into the other room. I can't. Later. I have a few things for you. I just wanted to see you, to kiss you, to touch you. Wait, Mara! Listen, I have to go to the ministry. You're a queen, an empress, a sultaness! When I'm in love, I sweat. Use and discard. Use and discard. Sorry. They're very practical, very modern. Wait for me tonight. Make me die, I'm counting on it. You can count on me, Bolognese. - What's gotten into you? - I want to die right there! Now I've got to be strong. I've got to resist. - How can I resist? - Don't shout! - Bye. - Bye. Listen, Mara. Tonight you've got to wear this. I want to see you dressed in this, like a schoolgirl. Are you crazy? You're killing me. You call me uncle. I'll call you my little niece. You're nuts, Bolognese. Do you get a kick out of that? I need a lot of tenderness, Mara. Next time, I'll wear short pants. You'll sing me a lullaby and I'll fall asleep in your arms. Now I'll hurry to the ministry or my father will kill me. - What? - Can I use your phone? - Over there. - The phone. Miss, get me Bologna. It's very urgent. This is 577-000 Come on, it's easy. Six numbers. It'll take her until Christmas. I'll stay here tonight. Hello? Yes, Dad, it's me. Why, oh why Do you always leave me alone On Sundays To go and watch the soccer game Why, oh why Yes, I went. No, Dad. The permit's not ready. They're all good-for-nothings here. At the ministry they scratch their asses. Why don't you take me with you just once Yes, I went to see the undersecretary. He refused to see me. You'll see. I'll settle it tonight. It only needs stamping. Calm down, Dad. But I'm not an idiot! Goddamn I've really got to run. No, don't kiss me! I won't let you go! Just look! There isn't a single thing wrong with you. Make a face or I can't go. No, don't do that! It turns me on even more! Bye-bye, darling. Where is your seminary? At Anagni, but the main office is in Lombardy. - How many hours do you study? - Twelve hours. My goodness! Five hours of meditation and prayer a day, seven hours of study. When do you get to have fun? There's a recess after lunch, and an hour in the evening. My nephew's with the friars. They say the rosary at midnight. The Capuchins follow that practice. No, thank you. You aren't allowed to smoke? I saw a bishop with a pipe once. It's forbidden at seminary. You really make me want to go to confession in this lovely moonlight. I couldn't hear it. I'm not a priest yet. I have two more years before I take my vows. - You're already dressed like a priest. - But I'm not. I love the color black. I wear it on top and underneath. Say, is it true that when the council is over priests will be able to marry? No, I don't believe so. American priests have children. But I don't like that. For me, priests should be like the moon: Nobody really knows what they are. They're men with a religious vocation. My nephew's vocation was beaten into him by his mother. You like it? Yes, but I'm free to decide for myself. There's plenty of time before I take my vows. I'll pray to my saint. - Which one? - Saint John. Mine is a saint nobody knows. Saint Maurillo. Do you know him? No. I need a saint who doesn't get pestered, one who has time for me. I always ask him to let me make lots of money. Does he answer you? Pretty well. But I don't care for my profession. What do you do? Manicures. But I pick my clients. Respectable people who pay well. I want to buy my father some land. The hands I've seen! I can judge people by their hands. Let me see yours. You're level-headed and you like sports. I used to play inside right Umberto, there's a great destiny here. - I can tell you're kind. - How can you tell? By everything. You're predestined! My God, how straight that line is. You can ask anything of life. I'd like to go out with you tomorrow. Yes, arm-in-arm. Think of the neighbors. Think of your grandmother. And dressed up like a priest! But I have a suit. It's a bit old... We'll go to the sea. I'd like that, now that it's not so crowded. We'd stay there all day. I'll bring some sandwiches. We'll see. We'll see. Oh, kitty! Come here, you. I'm supposed to leave tomorrow, but I can be a day late. - When will you be back? - At Christmas. I'll stop by my grandparents' on my way to see my parents. I'll think it over tonight about going to the sea. Kitty, sweet kitty. I wonder who he belongs to. From time to time he comes to see me. You're so cute. It was so nice out here. I'll wait for you, If you like. This one will be here for some time. He's come to town from Bologna for business. I'll wait here until dawn. Take the cat. There you go. Bye. Good night. - Umberto, why aren't you in bed? - Coming, Grandmother. Excuse me. - Good evening, ma'am. - I don't know you. You do now. I don't know you, nor does my grandson. Umberto, go to bed. Good night, miss. I'll have a wall built here. Thank goodness he's leaving tomorrow. Grandmother, I won't leave unless you apologize to the young lady! Over my dead body. I'm sorry, miss. Don't mention it. Leave the boy alone. He's not like the men who come to your house. This boy is a saint. Only respectable and important people come to my house! That one who's ringing now, do you know who he is? The son of the Labor Minister Rusconi! A fine thing. Members of congress come to my house too! Imagine that. Even Tommasi, the pasta producer. I see you eat Tommasi pasta. I won't anymore. Tomorrow I'll send a petition around to all the neighbors. Everybody will sign it. You'll leave the building. We're fed up with this coming and going. You're a scandal. Yesterday I counted four men! Do you want me to have a curfew? A meter like a taxi? Three yes and four no? My clients are polite, well-behaved people. You'll go to hell, mark my words. Shame on you. I'll report you! Stop it, Grandmother! You're an old goose! Did you hear that, Vincenzo? Umberto! You old witch. What does she want from me? Vincenzo, come here. Her and that other old goat! She'll report me. She'll send me to hell. Jesus. Listen to this one. All right, all right. I heard you! At last! I was starting to worry. Why ring like that? - Gorgeous! - Come on in. I thought there had been a gas leak. God forbid! Kitty. Is he new? I'll show that old witch. I'll fix that boy, you'll see. What boy? What witch? The one next door. She hates me for talking to her grandson. It's crazy. As if I'd go with a priest. - What priest? - He isn't even 18. We're talking about God and serious matters, and she says I'll go to hell. She's given me a headache. Take no notice of her: Do no evil, fear no evil. She says she'll tell the landlady. What difference does it make? Landladies are sympathetic. - At worst, they'll raise your rent. - As if I didn't pay enough already! But that granny will be crying tears of blood, you'll see. You must try to understand. Come here, come to Uncle. As if I felt like making love at a time like this! Come on, Mara. We'll go to bed and cuddle up together like good children. - We won't even talk. - I need to talk and let off steam. Okay, but in bed? I'm too mad. I'd be like a stone. Be honest, am I a scandal? Do I do it on the terrace? Fine by me. I'm willing to go out on the terrace. Like Nero looking over Rome. Don't I always ask everybody... not to shout, to speak quietly? But when you yell, you sound like a donkey! Because I'm different. I love you. I think you're perfect. - Do you love me? - Here. ''I love you.'' - Let's run away together. - Who's chasing us? I don't like you going with other men. Now I'm jealous. Then marry me. What for? Why don't you come to Bologna for a month or two? I won't budge from here. The old witch would love that. In fact, I'll buy this apartment. That way she'll be stuck with me forever. Let's do it here. It would be heavenly. We'll turn out the lights and open the refrigerator. Look what nice, intimate light. I'll write her a letter. I want to let off steam. I saw a terrific show in Paris. Black striptease. We need some music. This is scented. Imagine sending scented paper to that old hag. Let's turn out the lights. Just for a minute. - I have to write. -Just one minute. - Hey. - One minute. Will you correct it for me? I don't want to give her the satisfaction of finding any mistakes. Yeah, sure. The shapely leg of a woman slowly comes into the light. What's he up to? The light creeps up slowly... very, very slowly... very, very, very slowly... It takes your breath away. I was really turned on. They've got time to waste! Turn on the lights! Umberto! You won't see me again. You treat me like a doormat! Don't think you're the only woman around. I can find any number. Sit down and be good. You think I'm a slave to sex. But I have a soul too, remember that. Look, there's only a hair of difference between a devil and a saint. My life's about to change. I'm leaving for Bologna to find a wife. Sure, you must get married. Dear Madam... ''Dear''? My father might call. I left him your number in case it was urgent. Tell him I'm out. Fake a man's voice. Good-bye. Hey! I said I was sorry. What more do you want? To hit me in the head? This isn't a hotel where you come and go. Stand up. I have to go shopping. Mara, last night I went to Piazza Navona. I sat on a bench and looked up at your window. There came a moment when I couldn't take it anymore. So I went with a - A whore? - Yes. Can't you miss even one day? Mara, I swear we didn't do anything. I suddenly felt something inside. And I shouted to her, ''Get out of here!'' Then she starts insulting me. She was right, the poor thing. But I paid her anyway! 5,000 lire! But even they have a sense of self-respect. You have to understand that. Come on, get up. Thank you. Couldn't you put a rug down there? A soft red runner. I'll buy one for you. Mara. Listen, Mara. I have an hour before I see the undersecretary. We've never been together in the morning. One hour. Just for an hour, okay? Oh, all right. Don't undo it! Quiet, the old witch will hear! You give me a bad name. - I want to undress you. - Be quiet! You're a vision. Just look at you. You know what I'd like? To see you in a fur coat, nude, in the sunshine. Are you nuts? In this heat? You really know how to kill the mood. Hello? Oh, Vani from Venice! Sure, I remember. Short, with a mustache. The bass player. You're the bass player, right? I remember. Try tomorrow. Sure, I'll give you a grade. I promised. Hurrah for il Duce! Come on, you beautiful doll. I'll set my family against the old witch. - There are seven of us. - Eight with me, darling. Hey, are you going to take all day? It's difficult and I'm trembling. Let me see if they're up. Hey, look at that. He's taken his cassock off. The old witch will be furious. Good for him. The boy's got character. Come and see. Well done! Hi. I'll shoot him. Mara, please. It turns me off If you laugh. This is a serious, sacred thing. The best thing in the world. You're so cute. - You're not here. - I'll take a peep. - It's granny. - Don't answer. Looks like she's out of her mind. I bet she's armed. I'll go. - Who is it? - Open up! - But who is it? - Mrs. Giovanna Villenzone. - Never heard of her. - Umberto's grandmother. Well? I need to speak with you. Just for a minute. I must speak to you. It's too early for visitors. Ma'am. Come in. It's over. What is it, ma'am? It's all over. Don't cry. You've ruined me. You've ruined my family. If you stop crying, ma'am, we can put everything right. Please stop crying, ma'am. He was an angel, respectful, obedient, and now he's lost his head. Calm down, we'll fix it. It's too late. He's put brilliantine in his hair. He took his cassock off. It's time to put an end to this. Where's the window? Please calm down, ma'am. - The window, I'm jumping. - Ma'am. Rusconi. Calm down. - Mr. Rusconi. - Pleased to meet you. Don't you know? Umberto studied all the time. He even read at night. You know he could have become Pope? He will, he will. Come with me, ma'am. Come into the parlor. Rusconi. Please, ma'am, don't cry. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. Give the lady a Fernet. It will do her good. Or would you prefer something sweet? I have Strega, anisette, whatever you like. He doesn't want to go back to the seminary. We'll make him go back. I'll see to it. He says you're a saint and I'm a witch. You can go now, Rusconi. Granny's feeling better. Wait for me in the other room. Use the phone If you like. Go on, dear. - Did I disturb you? - No. The gentleman is very kind. He's from Emilia. - I have relations there. - That's nice. Listen, you may tell your grandson whatever you like. - By all means, tell him the truth. - I have, but he doesn't believe me. - Keep trying. - Thank you. You see, Umberto's parents have such great hopes for him. He's their only hope. My daughter has a weak heart. You know what a son means. - But I want a son too. - Good girl. First I have to put some money away, so he'll be provided for. Good for you. You know what I'll do? I'll take a vow, they always work for me. Listen, if Umberto goes back to the seminary, I'll go a week without. You know what. Yes, that's very generous of you. A whole week. And when I say something, I mean it. I'll buy some candles and keep them lit day and night. You'll go straight to heaven, ma'am. - It's a sacrifice for me. - I can imagine. But I'll do it gladly. I'll lose about... 200,000 lire. Goodness, you earn that much? I could make more, but if I don't like a man, I don't even let him in. You're right. Who is it? Yes, this is Miss Mara's residence. No, she's gone away. She'll be back at Christmas. Bye. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Who was that? - A Sicilian. - I'm leaving. - No, come here. Let's talk with the lady. Would you like a Strega? - Where are you going? - I'll be back. Sorry to interrupt you. - Don't mention it. - This girl is an angel. Yes, she's very good. See you later. No. Pour the lady another drink. Goodness, no. My head is spinning. Listen. You know I never had any grandparents? Strange. I would have loved to have a granny like you. And you? I have three grandparents. No! Yes. Good-bye. I'm glad to have met you. So am I. Don't slam the door! My dear, where were you born? We're all from Lucania. I'm from Anticoli. Anticoli Romano. Can I help you? Yes, look, I'd like six of these nice candles. You see, Father, the attachment no longer screws on. Now it clicks on. Yes, I'm sure they'll like it. It's truly marvelous. Look, it's a genuine chisel. - Do you like it? You too, Father? - Yes, we'll take it. Hey, what are you doing here? Come in. - How much? - 1,800 lire. - Any discount? - No. Where have you sprung from? Just passing by. Can I buy you a present? This would suit you. Ma'am, how much is this? - What do I do with that? - What a question! Keep it as a memento. Wear it when you're a priest. You're on my grandmother's side. She's an angel. Leave her out of it. Pay at the cashier, ma'am. Last night I had a vision. Saint Maurillo. What got into you? You know I could almost be your mother? Come on, try this on. This would really suit you. You weren't born for those clothes. You understand? I fell for an officer once. His uniform really turned me on. But in civilian clothes, he seemed different. He looked like a plucked chicken. I'LL BE BACK SATURDAY Abat-jour You who spread a blue light From up there You sigh, who knows why Abat-jour While you spread that blue light - Do you have to put them there? - What do you care? Don't you have any faith? Aren't you religious at all? Sure, I am. You better put them out now though. You're right. - Do you have any Coca Cola? - Yes. - And eggs? - Yes. - What day is it today? - Thursday. We'll go out on Saturday. We'll stay put until then. The phone! My father's due to call. - What is it? - The blinds! - Ma'am. - Good afternoon. Ma'am. - Who is it? Granny? - No, it was the wind. Out of the way. He wants to join the foreign legion. He's packing. We must stop him. He's gone mad! I'm coming. Rusconi, come here! Help me climb over. Come on. Umberto! - Give it to me! - No! - Give it to me! - Let me be. Naughty boy. What are you doing, Umberto? Where are you going? Tell him I'm not a liar. I told him the truth. Your grandmother told the truth. The whole truth. Why do you want to make me feel guilty? I never have before. The seminary is a secure life. Bread, a bed and you're outside of this wicked world. If I had another life, I'd be a nun. - Grandpa, give me the case! - No, I won't. Bad boy! You're hurting me, Umberto! Bad boy! I want to go away! Rusconi! Rusconi, come out here! Mr. Rusconi! Don't just stand there. Come on! Come on, hurry! Hey, kid. Kid. Give me that case. Come on. Finally! This is Mr. Rusconi. - Villenzone. - Pleased to meet you. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Tell him I wasn't lying. Nobody can be trusted in this world except for parents and grandparents. Is it true you make more than a million a month? It's true. You hear that, Umberto? He wouldn't believe me. He said I made it up. Don't go around talking about it or the tax man will find out. Good. And try telling him that the family eats most of your money. The train leaves at 5:00. We'll take him to the station. Rusconi has a car. If we go right now, there's a bus. Yes, there's a bus. I've seen it. Umberto understands the situation. Don't you, boy? I'm not a boy! He's right. What are you crying for? This whole family is always crying. Yes, son. Cry. The Lord has answered my prayers. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you. There they are! After you, Reverend. I'm so happy! You should be happy too. You did a good deed. Yes, I'm happy. I have a clear conscience. Why, oh why Do you always leave me alone on Sundays To go and watch the soccer game I don't give a damn about the soccer match! Close the blinds. I won't budge from here. I'll stay in your bed forever. I'll put roots down. - Don't shout! - Let's put on a record. Get undressed. I'll watch you from here. We can't! We have to wait a week. What? I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do about it. What do you mean you're sorry? Don't look at me like that. Try to understand. I made a vow. Understand? I'll start crying too! You want to drive me crazy! But sweetheart, my darling Augusto, a vow is a vow. It's all over between us. A week goes by quickly. You won't see me again. I'm a responsible person, not a child. It's a matter of decorum. Aren't you capable of making a sacrifice? It will be even better afterwards. Come on, I'll make you a coffee. Forget the coffee. Here's your wallet back. - And the tie. - Why? - And the handkerchief. - But why? - Good-bye. - Don't be like that. Augusto. Now I have to drive 90 miles. Come on, behave like an adult. I am an adult. - You're the one who isn't. - Come on. You want to commit sacrilege? You hear me? Fine. If you aren't scared, come on! But I'll be like a victim, a slab of marble. It will be your responsibility. You could have made a vow for next month. You knew I was here. Ever since yesterday, ''Yes, no, yes, no.'' It's bad for a man's health! All this yes, no, yes, no! Bologna! Yes, this is 577-000. Bologna? Yes, it's me, Dad. We have to wait a little longer. It still needs to be stamped No, Dad! I'll fly back tonight. No, Dad! I've done everything I had to do. I even handed out the tips. But you have to tip them in advance, Dad! Well... Come here. No, I'm leaving. Come on, keep me company. That will get you your permit. Come on. Don't be like that. Augusto, come on. Come here. Hail Mary, full of grace... Holy Mary... THE END
