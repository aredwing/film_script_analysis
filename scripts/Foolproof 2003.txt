I'm there. - Good. One minute ten. You OK? - Yeah... Keep going. - The 10th floor is secured without lock or handle from the stairs. Apply our acid to the door. It'll melt through the cover and the door hasp in about 90 seconds. What's your overall time limit? Seven minutes. - How can you be sure? - We stake out each guard multiple times, and when fat boy here leaves his post with the newspaper, he's gone for an average of 12 minutes, never under seven. - Reads while he craps? - Don't you? - It's through. - Great. Run. 11 laps gets you to the front door. - Hamish Jewellers, office number 1044. Got to pick a Hodge deadbolt. - Shh! Yes! Go, get in there! You've got 30 seconds to bypass the alarm. The target used is a Z-Ron Five motion-detector system with 30-second delay and silent alarms to the police and the lobby guard. Match the line resistance and then we place the jumper cables here... and here. Error, error, error, error... - What? - Error, error, error, error, error. - Go back. You said the system was a Z-Ron Five. Was it their early beta model or a retail unit? - Beta shmeta, what's the diff? - Well, if it was the beta model, then this circuit jump wouldn't work. In fact, it would short out. Big time. - How do you know a beta unit? - Beta units are sealed with crappy factory bolts. Now, new models use nice, shiny chrome, hex-head screws. I saw them. They're hex-head screws. - Got a picture of the alarm box? - No. - Error, error. - Sorry, no cigar. No picture, no points. Them's the rules. Sorry. - All right. I'll get the photo tomorrow. - But, Rob, they're hex-head screws. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a sec. We can't show the rest? We're going to lance a safe. It's the coolest burn we've ever done. Come on, let's keep going. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Sam. Whoa, whoa. You mind... not doing that? Game over. Thank you. - See, Sam, you have to run it flawlessly from start to finish. Or else it's not foolproof. - Yeah, but I wanted to blast the safe. - Mm. Well, sorry. - Don't. - Aww... relax, Rob. You won't be needing that next time. You want to know why? Because it's foolproof, that's why. Don't walk away Eileen - Kev, can you spot me this round? Every round. - Sorry. Every penny is going towards rent. The landlord is threatening to cut off the heat. - Well, gee, Beaver, maybe it's time you get a paper route. - Oh, ha, ha! - Sam. Please cut that out. Please. - I could get a paper route, or... I could rob a jeweller. - Shut up! - Will you keep your voice down? - Come on, you did nice work. It's kind of like that French gang, who pinched the Mercury Emeralds back in '82. - You read ahead. That's against the rules. - Ljust noticed that you didn't look into how to, um... fence the diamonds. - Oh, here we go again. - Also against the rules, Rob. It's about the art of the crime, not about moving stolen crap. - But that's part of crime. - Yeah, but not part of the game. All I'm saying is, why not broaden the playing field, raise the bar a little? Why not look into fencing, laundering and other stuff? I'd be happy to ask a few questions. - Too risky. So, uh, keep your mouth shut, okay? - Well, I need more. I say we go further. - Really? - Really? - All those opposed? - Nay. - Nay. - Motion denied. Now, drop it... here. - Put it away. - I'm on my bike. You hold on to it. - No, no, no, no. You're plan coordinator this round. It's your job. Now, take it. - Kevin, relax. You are so uptight. - Stan, hey. Listen, perfect timing. I, uh, I think you're making a big mistake, paying out on that basement fire. - Oh, yeah? Why? - Well, because I don't think we pay insurance claims to people who blow up their own property. - It was an electrical fire. - No, no. Take a closer look, Stan. Check out the amount of sodium- hypochlorite residue at the scene. - All right, that's bleach, smart guy. It was a laundry room? - Nope, it's not just bleach and not at those levels. And not with so much hydrogen peroxide mixed in, either. Now, you put all those big words together, and what do you get? Sodium chlorate. Ka-boom! Homemade bomb? Yes. Big insurance payoff? Not so much. Think. Maggie. You look lovely today. - What do you want? - Can I have some courier receipts? - Why? - Because I've got gum. - There's another karaoke bash Friday night. Perfect for getting drunk and making a total ass of yourself. We could, uh, go together. - That would be nice, Maggie. But, uh... Weekends are kind of bad for me. - You haven't been to a single office function in the yearyou've been here. People are starting to think you're a knob. - Really? Hi. How ya gawin'? Morgan and Fairchild accounting? Sign there. - Oh, I'm sorry, but you have the wrong address. - Oh, naw. This is unit 1044, right? - Uh, yeah, but we're not accountants. We're diamond wholesalers. - Then, we've got a bit of a problem, don't we? - Let me check the waybill, then. It's in here somewhere. Yeah, it's in one of those. We'll have a quick look through that. Not even close. Gay koala. - Look, it says - Oh, would you look... - That's across the street. - That would explain it, wouldn't it? Sorry to take up yourtime... I had some pints for breakfast... Be lucky to find my way home. Thank you. Sorry about that. It's a new camera. Oops, ha-ha. Sorry about that. Oi, there's a chairthere. Oh, looks like a nice set of hex-head screws there, Rob, you dingo's anus. - Hello? - Hey, Sam, guess what? We're foolproof. - Shit, Kev, you won't like this. - What's up? - I was robbed. - What? Are you all right? - I'm fine. Its just... they broke into my place. - Gee, Sam, I'm sorry. Well, as long as you're all right. - Kevin... they took the envelope. - The envelope? So, that's all they took? The laptop and the plans? - And my gym bag, but the plans were in my gym bag. - Sam! You left the plans in the gym bag? - Probably took it to carry the computer. - How did they get in? - Kicked the door. - Smash and grab. - Amateurs. - Even so, they still got our plans. - They won't contact the police. It's just paperwork. - It's kind of specific paperwork. - What if they decided... to give it a crack? - Ha, boost the jeweller? - Whoa, whoa, ha-ha. We're talking about a bunch of amateurs here, OK? Punks. Our plan has lock-picking, circuitry, chemistry, not to mention some pretty high-end hardware to burn through that safe. No, no, no, that's not going to happen. - Yeah, well, still? It looked like a pretty good plan. - Pretty good? It's foolproof. - Hell, yeah. One minute. Make it fast and simple, then we got to go. - Yeah, and try and sound pleasant. - Mr. Hamish, please. - Who may I say is calling? - It's Helen Calling. Helen Hayes. - Hello? - You need to listen carefully. This is very important. My friends and I, uh... Actually, you know, you might kind of find this funny... We play this game where we figure out how to hack through people's security... we'd never do it. It's more of an academic exercise, really. Last month, we figured out how to break into your business. - What? - And now we sort of lost the plans. No, this is not a crank call! I am serious. Call Z-Ron Security. Get them to install a new alarm system. Change the front door lock. Maybe the safe. Tell that fat guard to poo faster. Tell that fat guard to poo faster? What was that? Shut up! Who says "poo"? What are you, eight? To give in Like you fight in a fight But you know You can't win Don't you know you've got to Stand up, shake it off Look them in the eye you can never Get another chance to make things right No passing by It felt like you never said all the things you want to say This is your chance So stand up... - Ach! Learn the angles. Think, then rethink. Formulate that perfect plan, Harry... with absolute confidence. - Yes, that is right, my friend. Oh, God. - See you. - Thank you for suggesting we talk in private, Officer, uh... - Detective, actually. Well, we understand it can be awkward having police drop by. We try to stay low-key. - And, uh, how can I help? - Well, Mr. Kraft. Uh... That with a "K"? - Yeah. - Mr. Kraft, we received a call on our anonymous-tips line saying... you might be able to shed some light on a robbery that occurred the night before last. The target was a business called Hamish International. It's a jewellery wholesaler on Spadina. Heard of them? - Sorry. No. - Uh, where were you Wednesday night? - Um, I was, uh, I was at my-my place, um, from about 6:00, 6:15 until I left for work the next morning. - Anyone there with you? - No. - Girlfriend? - No. - Do you know a Helen Hayes? - No. - You've never heard of Helen Hayes? - No. Yeah... Helen Hayes, the actress. Of course I've heard of her. I, um... what was the, uh, what was the movie she was in? The Love Bug movie? - Herbie Rides Again. - Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Um, what I meant to say was that I don't know any living person named Helen Hayes. And also that I'm sorry, uh... I really don't think that I can help you. - There you go. That's a boy. Don't worry, Jaws, I'm not going to forget you. Kevin Kraft. - Hello, Mr. Kraft. Did you get my invitation? - Uh, no, um, I mean, I don't know... Who-who's calling, please? - I had it delivered this morning. Should be in yourtop drawer. Check in with your paper clips. Found it? - Yes. - Good. We'll get together tonight, then. - The take was over450,000 in diamonds. I conned their insurance company into sharing the claim file. Every detail is in this report. They did the alarm jump, the safe burn, the acid job. It's totally our plan. Beat for beat. - That little thief! There should be a law. - It's like Carmine Desouza, the gangster chameleon. He'd, um, visit mobsters in Sing Sing and, uh, trick them into revealing their uh, plans forfuture hits. Then, he'd do the jobs himself. Never an original idea. They cut off his privates, you know. - Would you get a grip? So, do you think that's our mystery caller? - He looks like a sentry. - I could take him. Oryou could keep your hands to yourself. We have no idea what we're up against here. And you, just... be cool, Rob. Don't say a word. Let's not give them anything more than they already have. Sam, no! - The first punch had better kill him. That martial-arts crap is fine, at first, but Kenny will keep coming. Broken nose, broken wrist, cracked ribs. I've never seen him give up. More to the point, I've never seen him lose. Never. There's no need forthe pat-down anyway, is there? - Let go. Dinner will be ready in a few minutes, so I'll keep this brief. As you know, I stole your plans and hit the jeweller. And obviously, I know where you all live, where you work, and... how you operate. Now... This is a page from your game plan. Now, can anyone tell me what those grey smudges are along the edge? - Fingerprint powder. - Very good. And whose fingerprints do you think are on this paper? Well, I'll give you a hint: It's the same three sets of prints that are all over that lovely little plan. So, I'll get to the point. You're going to work for me. One job, full plan, full execution. No one gets hurt. And you get your papers back. - Look, Mr... - Gillette. Leo Gillette. Mr. Gillette... We're not really criminals. - No shit. Keep those... souvenirs of your move up to the big league. - We don't want to play in any league. - Number one, you're obviously top-shelf strategists... Very thorough, very precise. Numbertwo, you have just the expertise I need to pull off this particular job, and, numberthree, I don't care what you want and don't want. Pick those up. Don't even think of puking in my restaurant, boy-o. - What's stopping us from going to the police? - Have you? - I spoke to a detective this morning. - Yeah, but you lied to him, didn't you? Perfect. I knew you would. - We're so fucked. - Yes. But relax, they won't be back. At least, not unless I tip them off... again. - How did you know? - You didn't just break in and happen to find the plans, did you? How did you know about Foolproof? Was it fat mouth over here? - Foolproof? Is that what you call it? I believe this is yours. It's an impressive read. Bold, yet meticulous, strategies. I love the one where you tried to figure out how to pinch the Stanley Cup. It's very... Canadian. Don't worry, I skipped the more personal entries. I'm a thief, not a scoundrel. - You kept a diary of Foolproof? - Oh, it wasn't the journal that tipped me off. And it wasn't, um... - Rob. - Fat mouth... No, it was you, Kevin. Yeah, one of my people spotted you staking out the jeweller... several times. So, I had you followed, which led to the others and, eventually, to your little plan. Been watching for weeks. What are you doing? Get your own damned dinner. I want a call by noon tomorrow. - Um... they-they call you Leo The Touch, don't they? - I haven't heard that one in years. - I told you to keep youryap shut. "Leo The Touch," give me a break! - Nice fucking car, Rob. Yeah, well, take the bus next time. Wiggle the distributor cap. - Next time? What, next time we're summoned by the mob? - He's not the mob. - Here, hold this. - Jeez. - Okay, so who is he? Leo Gillette... he's known as the Midas touch of crime. He's done bank jobs, armoured cars. He's smart, careful, never a day of jail time. He's a real pro. - Okay... options? - Run! - Oh, right, I got enough airline points to get to Buffalo. I'd ratherface the cops. But we already lied to them. - He was sitting right there. What did you want me to do, Sam? Get you on the speaker-phone? Talk strategy? - Maybe we should just go to the cops. We'll just explain. - Explain what, Rob? We lied to the cops. We planned the robbery. We're in possession of stolen diamonds. - Shh! - Now, I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure we're guilty of something. - I am not going to jail forthis shit. - Let's not be so fast at throwing ourselves at the police. We got to buy some time, learn the angles, think. Formulate that perfect plan, and then we can proceed... - With absolute confidence? The only thing I'm confident about right now, is that we're absolutely fucked. - No. No. We don't have to be. - Maybe we should just whack the bastard. I'm kidding. Hello? - Yeah, like when you grabbed that guy? That was hilarious, Sam. You almost got us killed. - Look, I had him under control. - No. You have nothing under control. I said to keep your hands to yourself! - You got this guy on ourtails in the first place. This is yourfault. - Mine? I told you to secure the plan. A gym bag isn't secure. And don't even get me started on your secret little Foolproof diary. Talk about careless. - Screw you! - Stop it. You're making it worse. Right now, we're just going to have to stick together on this one. - Ah, speak foryourself. Feeble. So, where do you want the tour? Patrice National Investments, 22nd floor. I suggest you take a look at the stairwell, hallway and lobby, and obviously, anything on the inside. - Any footage of sensors, alarm panels and security cameras. - Uh, yeah, I've done this before. Remember? In 1985, Heikrun Technologies of Germany issued $44 million in capital bonds... That's non-registered bearer bonds... good as cash. In two weeks, are going to be kept here en route to their New York custodian. And we're going to steal them. - What's the denomination? - 50 grand a bond. - That's $20 million. - Roughly. I could have hired any number of punters to help me blast my way in there, but there's a catch: I need this job executed with a perfect... finesse. - Damn it! - Oh, and you'd be amazed how little finesse there is for hire in this business. The bottom line is, you have finesse... you proved that with the Hamish job. So you get the challenge. You have to get in and out of there without a trace. They can't know they've been jacked. - Why? You said those bonds are as good as cash. - Those bonds may be unregistered, but they are numbered. If Patrice reports them stolen, Interpol will be watching, and no one will cash them. - Even if we can get in and out clean, somebody is going to notice $20 million in missing bonds. - Not if you switch them with forgeries. See, if they don't know they've been robbed, then you'd be free to cash out the real bonds... no questions asked. - Very good, Robert. Move to the front of the class. So, as you can see, the windows on the Patrice floor are sealed tight. So, ultimately, if we can't access the windows and there can't be any floor or wall damage, this doorway is the only way into the offices. - Right. The security panel at Patrice Investments is a Statlin... Alpha series. - Card key and access code. - One per employee, so they know exactly who is coming and going. - Can we jump that system? - The entire floor is wired with top-graded, shielded cable. Plus they got these brutally sensitive end-line resistors. Try bypassing, the whole place goes hot for sure. - Okay... So, we need a card and a passcode. - Sorry I'm late. - We started at 9:00, Sam. - And I said I was sorry. - Well, this isn't part-time at Starbucks, girlie. When I set a time, you stick to it. You pull this shit on my job again, and I'll deliveryourfingerprints to the cops myself. He's right, Sam. I mean, are we professionals here... or not? - Ach. So, that's 30 foot square inside. Does that include the tempered shield and fireproofing? - Where have you been? - OK. What's the radius on that? - You missed the division meeting this morning. - I see, OK. Uh, I'm on the phone here, Stan. - Oh. - Go ahead. - You know, word is you haven't closed a file in a week. - OK, who verified that? - What's wrong, brainiac? Having trouble with the old... - Hey, Stan? Eat shit, 'K? Sorry about that. Nothing. Flushing my life down the toilet. What's the tumbler grading on that vault? And your contact verified that? Who is he? His name is Lawrence Yeager. He's Patrice's number-two bond manager. He's been showing up on and off at night, no consistent time. - Insomniac? - Technically, he's supposed to be checking the opening trades on the European bond market. But, uh, sometimes... it sure doesn't look like business. - So, what does he do? - Hmm. Excuse me. Move over a bit. That's it. You like that, don't you? Now... take off your bra. Smell it. Good. Oh, you are so... hot. Move your hips. Yeah. Now... rub your... self. Oh, yes! Oh, keep... - What? - What? - What? - Mm, no-no, a hand went below the desk, that's when I stop. - Oooh. - Ah. - That's pretty creepy stuff. - Totally. - Yeah, tell me about it. Even the thought of saying it out loud makes me want to gargle. - OK, here's what we do. Captain Phone Sex overthere is essentially a blessing. If we can clone his card and bust his pass, no flags will go up when we go in during the night. No. Thank you. - And what's to stop Free Willy here from coming back once we're inside. - I'll keep him busy, now that I know what he likes. - We don't have lots of time. We'll move on him tomorrow. - How much contact will we have with him? Sam, you'll need a disguise. - Ooh! - Oh! I'm so sorry. - No, I'm sorry. - I'm so clumsy. It's these new heels. Oh, my melons! They're getting away. Oh, thank you. It's very sweet of you. Oh, excuse me, sir? Is this yours? Did you drop it? Now. The guard's down. Go! OK, he's in. All right. Now, get out of there. - Nice fucking... car, Rob. Time you got yourself a new car, kid. It sticks out. Not to mention it being an affront to our environment. Never had a woman on my crew before. Capone said, "Nevertrust a woman or an automatic weapon. " - That was Dillinger. Uh, I mean, I... think it was Dillinger. - So, what's the story with you three? - Me and Kevin met Sam in university, and we started hanging out and hacking and stuff. And then we came up with Foolproof, and ever since then, it's just been about the game. - Enough games. Time you got a life. Here. Buck up. It's forthe Hamish job. Now, don't worry. It's a square cut. I'm good to my people. It's your call whetheryou count the othertwo in or not. Just, uh... buy a decent car. Look sharp. - He's on his way up. - Excuse me. Thank you, Larry. - Oh, man, they look pretty real to me. - Oh, they're perfect. - Good enough foryou to fool them till you cash out the real ones? - Oh, yeah. I got this guy in Manchester. Now, he can forge anything. Just don't ask him to counterfeit the British pound. The bugger loves the Queen like his own mother. Access denied. Access denied. - Shut up! - Acc... Access denied. - Urghh! I'm warning you. - Access denied. Access denied. - Oh, you're so dead. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, you leave our son alone. He's just doing his job, aren't you, Robo-boy? What's that, boy? - Access de... - Uh? He's got gas. You know... You may want to lay off the donuts. Yeah, you might want to lay off the donuts. - That's the clip release. You hold the gun straight, you press it, and the clip slips out, drop free. - What the hell is that? - It's a. 45 calibre longslide Glock 21 with octagonal right rifting and dual-ported barrel exhaust. What the hell does it look like? - No... guns. We take that rule very seriously, don't we, Rob? - Hey, cool Glock. - For Christ's sake. Jesus! Fuck! What's wrong with you guys? - Take it easy, Kev. I mean, Leo was just showing me. It's not forthe job. - OK Whatever. - Here. Hold this. Can I see? Thanks. - Have to admit you're overreacting a bit, Kevin. I mean, no offence, but, uh, I never picked you as the bitch of this group. - Hey, Leo, remember how you said you had your ass totally covered? Everthink that one of us just might blow your head off? - Sam... - You got a better idea, Kev? - Do you honestly think I'd hand you a loaded gun? There's no clip, sweetie. - You mean the one I just pulled from your pocket? Ha... and don't call me "sweetie. " - You know something, Leo? - Shut up, Rob. - She's not pulling the trigger. - Get out of the way, Rob. - Not on me. Not on you. No one. See, I know Sam. I mean, sure, she can kick your lights out. But a gun? She hasn't got the balls. - Fuck. - Leo... - You shut up! Take it. - Please... Leo. - All right, genius. Let's get to work. - Sam. After we bypass the laser security grid, we have to deal with the vault itself. It's a keypad orientation, not unlike the alarm panel in the lobby. But, uh... - But what? - But eight digits. - Yikes. - And unlike the front door, we have to hit the vault's combination on the first three attempts. - Three failed attempts drops the alarm. - Exactly. And the safe defaults to dead-set, then no one gets in. The vault company has to come and reprogram a whole new combination. - Any way of bypassing the keypad? - Uh, no way... not without burning a big, ugly hole to get at the guts. - So, what are you thinking? Warning, warning, warning. - You're going in twice, aren't you? - Now you go to the front of the class, Leo. - Wow, you downloaded all these recipes from the Internet? - Yeah. My favourite is the, uh, Hawaiian chicken, because I-I love canned pineapple. - Me too. Ha-ha! We have so much in common. It's uncanny. - Um, would you like a copy of the recipe? Everything seemed to turn to gold and such Well you must be The queen of alchemy You changed me through and through - Maybe we could go back to your place and print it out? My name is Sandi. - I'm, I'm... I'm Larry. - Hi, Larry. - Good. Lawrence is engaged forthe evening. You're a go. - Copy that. - Oh, shit! - What? Ooh! - What is it? What? What? - Oh, crikey, Rob. - I almost stepped on it. It could've bit me. - I'm going to bite you if you don't get off! You tapped in? - Yeah. Um, can't we use the stairs? - No. There's a security camera on every third floor. - Anyway, stairs are for girls! Woo-hoo! I can't hear you calling I know that's all right You can keep on calling me Until you see the light I don't need the aggravation You're giving me all along You you do all the chasing But how I think it's all wrong... Yeah, baby! I can't hear you calling... I can't hear you calling - All right, we got Let's rock. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, six is not one of the numbers. - No, I listed these permutations from the numbers you gave me. - I never gave you the number six. - Yes, you did. I wrote them down: You said, 68521. Oh... no, 12589. Not six. - We are on a heist with Gilligan. - Do you need a juice or something? - Heads up. Security is on the move. - He is a little early, Sam. - What do you want? I only had a week to scout his movements. - When will he reach this floor? - Starts at the top. Five minutes, maybe. - Climb up. Track him. - Negative. - 92158. - Oh, shit. - Negative. - 92518. - Negative. - 92581. - Negative. - He is on 29. How are you coming? - Not yet... Don't interrupt again until he's one floor above, then we'll bail. Go, fast! - 91258. - He's on 23... get out of there. - Negative. - Uh, 12985. 18952. Uh, all right, - O K. It's open. Get in here. Go, Sam, go. Go, go, now! - Shit. - Come on, come on, come on... We did it. Ha-ha... We actually broke in somewhere. - Yeah, it feels kind of weird. Not like I imagined. - Yeah, now we're inside, it feels... not so... - Not so bad. - Not so scary. - I'm feeling kind of... kind of tingly, you know, like right... right in here. - Tingly? No kidding? - What the hell are you thinking?! This isn't a game. Stay focused. And you, save your introspection foryour diary. Everything OK? It's just, you usually pick these in 30 seconds max. It's coming up on four minutes. Look, it's OK, Kev, you just got to... - Don't... tell me to relax. Don't... Do you think you can get under it? - You've got to be kidding me. - Well... we'll get you there. Just not today. Today you just have to hit the buttons. - Ha... sweet. - Everything good? - Yeah... Sweet... camera's set. - Uh-oh... strike one. - Time's ticking. What's your status? - Standby... asshole. - You, uh, you sure that will evaporate by morning? - It will be gone. It's dry ice. - Hoo-ah! Strike two. Afew more hits and we'll foul the third combination. What? - Nice eggy. - All right, OK, that's enough. Let's pack it up and move. Ow! What did you do that for? - Haven't got the balls... my ass. Kev! - Where is Leo? - Overthere. - Then whose car is this, Rob? - Pretty flash, huh? See you in the morning. - I don't know. It's your damn vault. I was punching in the numbers and it just went crazy. Now, get someone down here and fix it. - Are you guys getting this? Somebody hit that alarm with a chair or something! Oh, God, would you look at him? Why doesn't somebody hit him with a chair? Oh, Sandi's the best. That is one lucky loser. - It's not fair. I mean, I put my ass on the line busting in there and "Master Bates" is living a freaking Penthouse fantasy. I haven't been laid in a year. - Liar. - I'm not. It's been a whole year. - Year, my ass. I've known you for six and you've never been laid. Sucker. Standby, vault engineer is out of the security area. - Good thing you're not charging by the hour. Took long enough. Why couldn't we just reprogram the old combinations? - Security protocol. Foryour protection. It's in the contract. Memorize this, then I'll destroy it. - Punch in. Can you get it? See, it's on a tilt here. Can't hold focus. - Then zoom in some more. - No, it will over-pixilate. - We can't read it. - Let him work. Got it. - Oh, damn it. - Give me a minute, all right? I'll... roll the tape back. I'll use a few algorithmic filters. Vault engineer leaving the president's office. The vault technician's coming out of the building. He's wearing blue coveralls. Follow him. Don't move on him till I say. - Hey, what are you doing? - Just in case. - What? You can't force the combination from the tech. - If I have to. - That's not part of the plan. - It is now. - You said that nobody gets hurt. - Maybe, maybe not. My job, my call. - No! This is my plan. You can't go changing the rules. - Fuck your rules! - Fuck your job! - I got it. Clear as a bell. We're two days away from $20 million. Do not fuck this up. - $20 million? What are you talking about? I'm talking about a lot of money. A square cut... if you don't blow this. - Do you even remember why we're doing this? Fine. Whatever. Hey! Just don't you forget those Hamish plans. - Of course. - So, then, we pulled the security tapes from Hamish Jewellery and, you know, I could swearthe guy with the glasses and the Polaroid is you. It's not much to go on, I know, but it was enough for a search warrant. Nothing usable. - Left it nice and tidy. - Yeah. - You black or white? - Black. - You are in trouble, Kevin. White's closing in from all sides and you are still playing offence. You're too cleverforyour own good, if you ask me. - I didn't. - Hi. - Move. Where's Leo? You know, for a genius, you really can act like an idiot, you know that! - You said the cops wouldn't be back! - So you came here? You've been followed before, Einstein! - How smart was it to flag me in the first place, huh? - You could have blown the whole job! - I'm done down there, Kenny, you can lock it back up. - All right, fine. - Leo protects his wine like other people protect their money. Thought I told you don't move. - And you can keep your damn souvenir diamonds. As of tomorrow, all ties are cut and we're done. Let's go. - See you, Lurch. - What? - I know where our plans are hidden. - Now when I was a young boy... - I'm closed! ...the greatest man alive Now I'm a man... OK, OK, OK... Look, I'm sorry, I'm closed. - Oh, no. But I really need your help. My TVwent all fuzzy, and the game's on tonight and... Could you take a quick look? - Yeah, um, I'm closed. - I'd really appreciate it. And Leo said you were the best. - Leo said? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, well, all right, sure. I'll take a quick peek. Here, let me. No "B" "O" child - Damn it! Yeah? - Hey, Lurch, it's Sam. - What do you want? What the fuck? Hang on. I got crap coming out of this phone. - Never mind that. You got to listen to me. Leo's in danger. I think Kevin will break into the restaurant tonight. - What? No way. Not going to get by... - Don't be so sure. Know what dimethyl sulphoxide is? It's a tissue solvent. You mix it with about and, uh, apply it directly to yourface and, oh, Kenny, you'd be out in no time. Know what I mean? Ken? Kenny? Kenny? How long will he be out? - That dose? 10 to 15 minutes. Maybe a little closerto 20. - Hello. - All right... Step back. Let's see here. Hmm... Bingo. - Cute. Hoo-ah! - Check that. I think I just got yourtingly feeling. - Crikey. - You know, I don't remember hearing about this part of the plan. Did I miss an important vote or something? I mean, you really should have sent me a memo. You know, when Leo told me you gave the diamonds back, I knew you were making a play... I just knew it. Oh... Thank you. Hmm... the old ultraviolet-ink- on-the-envelope trick. Who are you to take this opportunity away from me? You arrogant, feeble fuck. - Rob, we just... - Oh, we, we. We... like what? You, me and Sam? Or we like, you and Sam and fuck Rob! - These gentlemen will escort you home. And you will remain undertheir supervision until we reconvene in 19 hours and 22 minutes. Afterthat... none of you leaves my sight. No more games. - I'm going in with you tomorrow night. - Leo, I'll be there. - No offence, Robert, but if you want something protected, you have to protect it yourself. Show them out. Are you sure it will evaporate by morning? - It will be gone. Hey. I have an idea. Why don't you go help Mini-Me take down the spy-cam in the president's office? - Don't be smart. - All set. You're sure you measured right? - Yes, I'm sure. You might want to exhale first. Maybe I should give you a go signal. - Fine. - Go. - Ready. - Seven. - No more, Sam. - Six. Two. Five. Five. - Found them. Send in the dummies. - Ha, nice try. First, you send out the bonds, then I send in the forgeries. - What, you don't trust us? Ha, so why should we trust you? Maybe now would be a good time to hand overthe Hamish plans. - You get when I say. - Here is the forged set. All right, we'll destroy the plans when we get back to the restaurant. It's all right, Kev. Leo promised. - Hey, get the fuck away from me. Leo, some help moving this stuff would get us out of here a lot faster. - Sam. - What would be the point now? - It's not overtill we're out. Keep pushing. - You're next. - Rob? What the hell are you doing? - Rob? Stop this thing! Hey! - What are you doing, Rob? What's going on? What are you doing? Let us up! - Leo, I'm not sure I can do this. - You're not sure? It was your plot, mate. Standing there, staring at me with those cold shark eyes. "They're dead weight, Leo, just take them" "out of the equation and it's foolproof. " I knew it. With you, it's all talk, isn't it? Well, next time, boy-o, unless you've got the guts for it, keep your mouth shut. Don't let him control you, Rob. Just let us up. Rob! Don't be so feeble! Think about what you're doing. Don't do this, Rob! You traitor. I'm going to kill you! You're dead! You hear me? Rob? Dead, Rob! - Sh... it! Oh, shit. - Holy... - Well, it will be a few weeks before the cops figure out what the hell they were doing in that mess. That gives us plenty of time to climb down the shaft at the other end of the building. Come on. - Oh, my God. Damn it! - What? Shit! - Well, at least we know where to find them. Whoa! Jesus... They're not in here. - You looking forthese? - So much forthe no-guns rule. - Ha... don't tell Kev. You know, I got to admit, I knew we lost you. But this... You've... come a long way... Robert. - Come on, Sammy, you're bleeding out. Look, just give us the bonds and I promise, I'll help you till somebody gets here. - Ha... Come on, there's no time. What do you say? - I say... balls. You got laid, didn't you? - How could you possibly know? Well, it's freaky, that's what it is. - Yeah. Man, you jumped. - Yeah, for a moment, I didn't think you made it out. - What the hell happened? - The fire started in the basement. By the time the alarm went, flames were everywhere. I couldn't get to the stuff, Leo. - Leo The Touch, I presume. - Oh, don't get familiar... sheriff. - It's detective, actually. You do this? - Why would I? - I got an anonymous call about a half-hour ago. You mind? - It's on my back. Permit's in my wallet. - Caller said you pulled the Hamish diamond job. - You can't believe anything that comes from that bloody Crime Stoppers line, now, can you? - This has been fired recently. - Target practice. - You target practice with blanks? I say... balls. - Leo, some help moving this stuff would get us out of here a lot faster. - Hey, Detective! We may have found what you're looking for in the basement. - Well, it's not mine. My lawyer will prove that. - Then you won't mind if we open it. - Be my guest. Mind the fingerprints. - Looks like a bond. - Bearer bond. Get these downtown. And, as the man says... be careful with the prints. Well, you're looking a little peevish, Leo. - Sh... it! Oh, shit. OK. OK, you got to jump. They're burning faster than we thought. You've got to get to me now. Hey. Hey, look at me. Hey, Sam, you look at me, OK? We're foolproof... right? Sam? - Yes, Kevin. - Hold on. Here... take my hand. - Cute. - You got it? - Do you mind? I got to get down there and die. Good luck. Hoo-ah... ha-ha-ha... Hoo-ah... Ha-ha-ha... Hoo-ah... ha-ha-ha... I was in the right place But it must have been the wrong time I was saying all the right things But I must have used the wrong line And I was on the right trip But I must have used the wrong car My head is in a bad place And I wonder what it's good for 'Cause I was in the right place But it must have been the wrong time 'Cause I was in the right world But it seemed like the wrong wrong wrong... - Well... - I got them. - We did it! - We did it! - Man, we... we did it. I can't believe we actually pulled it off. We really did it. - No... you did it! You pulled it off. What a performance. Robert, you are the man! Whoo-hoo! - Ahh! Ha, ha... - Hoo-ah! - Yeah! Whoo! - We've got one last bit of business that we've got to deal with. The diamonds. - The diamonds. - The diamonds. - Souvenirs? Kidding. - You know, we never did look into the process of fencing diamonds, did we? - Oh, God, Rob. - We'll return them as planned, for sure. All I'm saying is, why not keep them for a couple more days, you know, just to see if we learn more? - All right, then, well, let's put it to a vote then, shall we? All those opposed? Nay. Sam? - Kidding... still kidding. - Ha, ha... Yeah, but you have to say "nay. " - Right. - Sam! - What was the motion again? Yes! Whoo! I love this car!
