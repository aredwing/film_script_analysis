"No access. " They sealed this part of the forest off for three years after they found them. (Kate) Ruth, are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. How much further? Two, maybe three kilometres. Okay. I didn't realize it was going to be quite so far. This is such bullshit. Managing? Yeah. Not too bad. How much longer is this going to take? (Kate) Not long. Another two hours. That's not too bad. Look, I'm the one carrying the bags, mate. How much stuff have you brought? You can never be too prepared, Matthew. Fucking hell. [chattering] All I'm saying is just ease up. Ease up? [static] How? What have I said? Matt, we can all feel the vibes. Vibes? I thought Ruth was the one into vibes. Aha. You're so funny. Listen, we need to get this intro shot before she actually finds the place. If she finds it. Where do you want to do it? Anywhere. It's fine. Here's fine. Yes. Zzz. (David) Say something. Can't hear. Are you going to put one of these on everyone? Ah, my hair, my hair, my hair. Sorry Kate, sorry! Okay. Will do when I've finished this. Say something, Kate. Okay, here we are, in the Siberian forest, freezing our bollocks, bla bla bla bla bla bla. Hi, I'm Kate Hansen, And welcome to "Darkest Secrets. " For tonight's investigation, we have been invited to an extraordinary location situated in a remote area of northern Russia. And just up ahead, is a place where in 1998, the remains of over 30 people were found in shallow graves. Police investigations were inconclusive and of course, eventually, the case was closed. Now our investigation is going to be led by psychic Ruth Peacock who is going to use her amazing abilities to shed some light on this tragic and mysterious case. So stay with us as we follow Ruth in an attempt to unlock the dark secrets that still haunt this Siberian forest. Cut. Okay. Was that alright? It was great. You sure? Mm-hm. Don't need to shoot again? No. Okay. Good stuff. [interference] (Matt) Which driver are you talking about? I told you, it was the last driver that we had. He was, like, [mimics Russian accent] "I'll give you 500 roubles for blow job. " [laughter] (Matt) You're kidding? No. How much is 500 roubles? About five pounds. Cheeky bastard. I know. So what are you going to spend the money on? [laughter] (Kate) Fuck off, and you! Ow. Whatever. (Kate) Are we good to go? Okay. Okay. I'd like to introduce to you the gentleman that brought this case to our attention and indeed invited us here. author Yuri Levkov, Yuri, this is a case that has fascinated you for years. It is. Do you have any theories about what happened here? This is such a remote location and the Police were unable to identify a single body that was found. It's hard to know where to begin. Do we know how these people were killed? No details of any cause of death were ever made public. After the initial investigation, the Police did not return to this area, as far as we know, and the case was officially closed three years later. The only facts ever confirmed were the remains of 34 people were found here. And that they were all adults, both male and female. Nothing else has ever been acknowledged by the authorities. Shall we stop there? Okay. Well done, that was great. Guys, we're done. Yeah, let's get going. Do you reckon there are any bears in these woods? What? A mate of mine went to Romania. He said the forests there were full of them. Wolves as well. Tons of wolves. He mentioned something else really nasty. Can't think what it was. David. Yeah? Shut up. Sorry. Bloody hell. [distant eerie voice] We're here. Stay on her but don't get in her way. [eerie voices] They found some of the bodies here. Stay with her, okay? (Ana speaking in Russian) [speaking foreign language] What did they to you? [eerie voices] (speaks Russian) [gasping] Stand back. Ruth. Ruth? Hey. (Matt) Okay, two seconds now. Okay. Tell me when you're ready. Okay. Now what we do know is that Ruth has managed to locate the site where the police found all the bodies. Yuri has just confirmed that for us. What we don't know at this stage exactly what is it that Ruth's sensing. We don't know. [eerie voices] [sigh] They found the first body just here. [eerie voices] What? What is it that you're trying to tell me? There's so many of you. Ruth. (Yuri) She may be able to identify them. Maybe she could find out their names. [odd sounds] What is through those trees? (Yuri) Not much. That is east. There's an old disused industrial site about eight kilometers from here. But it is abandoned. There's nothing else out there for 80 or 90 kilometers in any direction. We must go through those trees. (Yuri) She's remote viewing. What did you say? She can see places that are out of sight. She is seeing beyond those trees. It's fascinating. I know what it is. How do you know what it is? I did my homework. I find the subject... interesting. Kate, how the hell are we going to get there and back to the cars before it gets dark? It's fine. Go ahead, stay up with her. [weeping] [weeping continues] What's wrong with her? [heavy breathing] There's, uh, there's a building up ahead, I can see it. And that's where they came from. (Kate) Do we carry on? Fuck, yeah. (David) You okay there, Matt? (Matt) Yeah, yeah. I'm great. [distant eerie noise] (Matt) What the hell was that? [slam] Jesus Christ. That was pretty good. Kate? David! This leads to the structure I told you about. Some sort of surface tunnel they used to supply the building. Can you give me a torch? What was the building used for? Got it. No idea, Kate. Where's she taking us now? Watch this down here. What is it? Listen. [eerie voices] [voices continue] [eerie voices] What the hell was that? We shouldn't go on. Why not? Just wait. Wait. Look, people died here, Kate. A lot of people. Then we're in the right place. [sigh] (Kate) Are you okay? (Matthew) Yep. (Kate) Are you okay? [muttering] I'm just not happy about this, Kate. We shouldn't go on! What the hell is this place? This is too much. I want to go back. (Kate) And what? Leave all these people's story untold? [David coughing] Bloody hell. (Matt) Jesus Christ! (Kate) Oh, my God. What is that? It smells like baby sick. (Kate) It smells worse than that. It smells like rotten meat. (Yuri) It does smell like meat. I'm going to be sick. No, you're not. No, I'm not. (Kate) Guys, be careful. We don't know what state the building's in. You have got to be kidding me. Matt, get a shot of that. (Kate) Ruth, are you getting anything in this area? (Ruth) Voices. Why would you put someone in there? (Yuri) It's so cold in here. So much colder than it was outside. [eerie voices] [eerie voices] Are you still hearing the voices? Yeah. What are they saying? (voice speaks a phrase in Russian) (speaks foreign words) (Ruth) What does that mean? (repeats foreign words) "They shouldn't be here. " (Kate) Why? Why shouldn't they be here? It's not them. It's us. We shouldn't be here. We mean you no harm. We only want to speak to you. Don't be afraid. I feel like I'm being watched. Oh, God. Another psychic in the making. Don't you feel that? Feel what? There's something around us, watching. I feel cold, mate. That's about it. So, uh, Ruth is continuing to sense really strong energies in this building. Um, she's starting to hear voices, which are telling us we shouldn't be here which is obviously incredibly worrying. We still don't know what this building was used for. Yuri told us that he thinks it was used for industrial purposes. But it's looking like it could actually be more sinister than that. Okay. Stay with us. I'm sorry. Are you alright? (Matt) Yeah. Are you sure? We'll talk later. Okay. Let's catch them up. What do you do with that? Monitors changes in electromagnetic fields. Anything strange going on, it will give me a reading. Getting anything? Can't quite tell yet. (Yuri) Look. They're still on. (David) How is there still power in this place? That's really weird. I don't know. (speaking Russian) (Matt) Looks like my dentist's. Pack it in? People might have died here, yeah? (Ruth) They did die here. [eerie voice] What is it you want to show me? I can see a man. Oh, God. [motor revs up] What did they do to you? [Ruth, gasping] [man shouts] [shout echoing] [Ruth screaming] [crying] Oh, get me out of here, please! Get me out of here! Get me out of here, please! [crying] They brought people like me here. They did things to people like me! I've got to get out of this room. (Kate) Come on. Wait for me. (David) Told you there was still power in this place. (David) Look at the temperatures. [loud whirring noise] Look, please just calm down, please. [loud noise] (Ruth) Shhh! [odd choking noise] (Yuri) What the fuck is that? [shouting] Every time you react like that, it feeds off it. So just calm the fuck down. [heavy breathing] Just control yourselves, okay? Please. Deep breaths. (Ruth) Okay. We're very close. (Kate) Close to what? I'm going to need you all to be really quiet from now on. You understand? There's an incredible energy coming. And this is where they kept them. (Yuri) Who? They kept them here for months in the dark. Watching them. Observing them. Day and night. But there was one here who was different. There's just an overwhelming presence coming from that room up ahead. I've never experienced anything like this. Okay, Yuri? I'll need you to translate for me very carefully. Okay? Of course. Kate, you take my torch. Yuri, you turn yours off if you come into the room with me. I don't want any light in here. You can film just at the door. (Matt) Okay. Tell me your name. [speaks Russian] I ask you to come forth. [speaks Russian] Don't be afraid. [speaks Russian] We mean you no harm. [speaks Russian] [jangling] (Ruth) Turn it off! I can hear you. [speaks Russian] Please speak to me. [speaks Russian] We promise we mean no harm. [speaks Russian] (Ruth) We have the spirit of a man with us. Tell him not to be afraid. [speaks Russian] What's his name? [speaks Russian] Mischka? Mischka is a name. Mischka. We only want to help you. [speaks Russian] This one was really powerful. So strong. They destroyed him. [gasp] [snap and growl] [Kate screams] Get out from the bed! Ruth! [snarling] (Matt) Ruth! (Kate) Ruth! (Matt) Ruth! Get out! (Matt) Jesus Christ! (Kate) Ruth? Are you alright? Ruth. Jesus. Did you get that? What was it? (Matt) There was something in here. What was it? It was a man. Did you get it? I think so. Okay. Oh, fucking hell. Okay, now. (Yuri) David's gone. What? What? David? David? David? David? David! Matt. Matt, come here. I want you to set up... We need to set up two cameras, I want... What the fuck for? I want us to monitor- What about David? Listen to me! I want us to monitor this area with two cameras. I want one focused on here and I want one out here, okay? Then we'll go look for David. Just set it up, please. Let's get this down. I want it focused in here. [heavy breathing] Oh, God. I feel sick. Kate, give me some light. Is that good? Great. How long are you going to be? Two seconds. (Matt) Come in here. How much recording time is on that? About six hours. Alright, let's get out of here. (Matt) Grab David's bag. (Kate) Let's try and catch the others up. Grab that one. You okay? (Kate)Yeah. Come on, then. Come on. [both heavy breathing] (Kate) Let's try up in here. Okay. There's space here. [Ruth groans] She needs to lie down. (Kate) Let's set up a bed in there. Kate. There's some kind of control room through there. We can use it as a base. We need to find David. And we will. Can I have the camera, please? What do you want to do? How's she doing? She needs to rest. Do you know what happened here? No. How would I? We have to look at the footage. I'll get the laptops out of David's bag. Is she okay? She keeps mumbling that she's disturbed something. We need to find David and get out. Yeah, I know. What part of that do you think I don't understand? [shouting and growling] Sorry. That stuff could've been better, but it was kind of fucked up in there. No, it's good. [snarling] [rewinding] What was that? A ghost? People are going to think we faked that. Yeah, but we didn't. [snarling and shouting] Hang on a sec. Stop there. Rewind it. I think I saw something. There. That's David. What the hell's he doing there? What's he doing? Check the live feed from the other two cameras. See if there's any sign of David. I'll talk to Ruth, see if it's safe for us to go down there. Okay. Ruth. Ruth. How are you feeling? Like shit. Can I get you anything? No. I'll be fine. I just need to rest. That's all. I'm sorry to have to ask you this, but... what happened down there? What was that? That was the spirit of the man who... was brought here, suffered and just... tortured here. His name is Mischka. And now, he's... he's just wild with rage, Kate. For what happened to them. For what happened to him. He wants revenge. Just revenge. He cannot pass over. He's trapped here. I don't understand. What were they doing to them? You need to ask Yuri. What? He's been here before. Well, how do you know that? Ruth? [breathing evenly] Ruth? Ruth? The cameras are working. Recording everything. Any sign of David? No. It's all quiet. Nothing. How is Ruth? She'll be okay, I think. She's resting. I need to talk to you. Alright. I need you to tell me the truth. About what? You've been here before. What? Ahm. Hm. I should've known that she would see that. Why did you both bring us into the woods when you already knew this place existed? I needed to know how good she was. I knew that if she was as good as I hoped she would be, then she would find this place. And she did. What the fuck are you playing at? This whole facility was built by the Russian government, Kate. The government? They brought people like Ruth here, people like this Mischka. They wanted to see if psychics could read enemy minds. Or were able to locate strategic locations over long distances. Or able to kill with the power of the human mind. Yeah, the Americans were doing the same thing. But their methods were a joke. No one took it seriously. They stopped doing it years ago. What they did to these people was no joke. They tried to increase psychic power by introducing electrical currents into the subjects' brains. They kept them in dark, soundproof rooms for months so that would weaken their other senses. They even tried surgical procedures. Beautiful and extraordinary minds butchered. When they closed this place, they killed any who were left. And they buried them out in the woods. Those out in the forest deserve to be heard, Kate. I want to tell their story. Fucking hell, Yuri. They could be outside watching us now just ready to come here and march us into the fucking woods. Why would they still be watching? They think there's nothing here to see. This place is forgotten. The people lost in here are forgotten. [distant voice] Did you hear that? That sounded like David. Oh, my God. [distant noise] It sounds like him. David? Can you hear us? David! Where is he? It's coming from over there. The other side of the building. I think you should stay here with Ruth. Yeah. I will. Let's get a camera and a radio. Yes. [Kate, heavy breathing] (Matthew) Why am I carrying this, what are we going to film? (Kate) Shhh. Listen. It's coming from up ahead. Come on. [metal door clanks] [door creaks open] [metal door closes] Are you okay? Yeah. (Matt) What did you say to Yuri? He's been here before. When? He already knew what this place was. They'd been bringing psychics here. Trying to use them for military operations. Jesus Christ. Why didn't he...? [loud metal bang] Why didn't he tell us? 'Cause he was testing Ruth. He wanted to see how good she was, wanted to see if she could get [whispers]. [loud rumbling] Jesus Christ! What is that? There's someone down there. David? David? [whispering] Was that him? Was that him? [shouts] David? [voice shouting distant] This is fucking stupid. We can't leave him. [continues shouting] Okay. C'mon. (Kate) Where the fuck is this? Oh, my God. (Matt) You have got to be kidding. [male voice speaking in Russian] Who are you? [speaking continues] You stay away. [speaking continues] No. No. [speaking continues] His spirit is filling this whole place. Don't! [loud growling] [gasping] [eerie sound] What is that fucking sound? [loud buzzing] Oh, shit. Shhh. [both gasping] (Kate) Fuck. Fuck. (Matt) Take it really slow. Do not touch. [Kate, whimpering] Fuck. [whispering] [grunt] Step over it really slowly. Carefully. [grunt] Help me. [distant voice shouts] Listen. David? [distant voice] Where are the others? We heard a voice. It sounded like David. They have gone off to find him. They won't. Because he's dead? Have you seen him again? I watched you sleeping. Yeah. I saw his face in my dreams. We have to find the others and get out of this place. I can't let you do that. What did you say? (Matt) What is that? I don't know. It's just like... wires and shit. David? [shouting is closer] David? [panting] David? David! Oh, shit! [eerie roaring] I can't see! (Matt) I can see! Take my hand! [screaming hysterically] Take my hand. Take my hand! Hold on tight! Don't let go! David - come here! [wild snarling] [man screaming] David! David! [eerie roaring and screaming] [crying] It's okay! It's okay! It's okay! (Matt) David's there. Come on. [crying hysterically] Hold on to me! Hold on to me! Hold on! I can't! Calm down, calm down, calm down! Slow down, slow, slow, slow, shhh! [overlapping remarks] Everything's black. Look through the camera. Look through the camera. [both heavy breathing] He's fucking dead! [heavy breathing] What's that? [roaring draws closer] [screaming] Wait! Don't go! It's coming back. It's coming back. Jesus. There's a door here. Follow me! Hold my hand, hold my hand! Get through there Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Okay, let's go. Shhh! Oh, fuck! [whimpering] Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck... [straining] [roaring] [heavy breathing] Let's go. Shhh. Shhh. Oh, fuck. [crying] Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate. Let's get the fuck out of here! We're going to find the others. Shhh. We're going to find the others. C'mon. Hold on. Let's go! [Kate screaming] [roaring starts again] I need you to come with me. No, no, I'm not going anywhere until the others get back. [loudly] I need you to come with me! No, I need to go, get the others. They need me! [shout] [groan] I'm sorry. But I need you to do this! Who do you want me to look for? Who did you know here? You see a lot. Her name was Tasha. We met in Moscow when we were both students there. We fell in love. She was special. I don't mean she was just special to me. She was... special. How? Like you. She was gifted like you. In fact, you remind me of her. She could see things. At first it seemed silly to me. But then I realized she had this gift. People would come to her. They thought she could speak to the dead. That maybe she could see into their future. They would pay her. We needed the money. Then she started to work for a company. At least that's what she told me it was. She said she could not tell me what she did there. I saw less and less of her. We would fight about it. She'd become like a stranger. Then she disappeared. I never saw her again. She would have never left just like that! And you... you believe she was brought here? When I heard about this place... Yeah, I knew they must have brought her here. I just knew it. I need to see if you can find her here. If she is trapped, then you can help her move on. Help her find peace. If you'd been born Russian, they would have brought you here. [distant eerie noise] Yuri... we need to look after the living. We've just got to get out of here! No! No! No! No! I want you to go back down there with me! I need you to find her! Only then we will leave! Not before. (Matt) Ruth? Ruth? (Kate) Ruth? Ruth? Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! Ruth, we've got to leave now! Yuri's not gonna let us leave. I need Ruth to help me with something and then we will all leave. But not before. David's dead. Do not argue with me. Please just do as he says, please. He lost someone here. If you needed our help, why didn't you just ask us? Because you would have never come here if you'd known what this place was. We go now! Get up! Okay, just- Get up! Easy! (Kate) Easy. (Yuri) The place where they kept them is just ahead. Keep going. (Ruth) Would Tasha want you to die here, Yuri? 'Cause you know he's not going to let any of us out if we go back there! Tasha wouldn't want you to be trapped here. She would want you to be safe. Ask her yourself when you to speak to her. Keep moving! He's not going to use it. I'm going to jump him at the next corner. He will use it. (Yuri) This is the right place. Keep going! [Ruth shouts] Open the doors! (Kate) We didn't close the doors! Open the fucking doors! Open the fucking doors! (eerie female voice) Yuri. (speaking in Russian) He's found her. Tasha. Yuri. Yuri. Tasha. [eerie whistling] [distant roaring] [roaring] (Yuri) No. No. [screaming] [loud snarling] [Yuri gasping] [tearing] [growling] [growling continues] [growling stops] [eerie distant roaring begins] [eerie noises grow louder] (Ruth) Just find the way out. Find a way out! Ruth, where are you going? No, you can't! Ruth! I'll be okay, I'll be okay, just go! Go! No! No. (Matt) C'mon! No. [loud growling] Let's go! (Kate) This is where we came in! (Matt) Come on! Come on! Run! I'm coming! What? We... C'mon! We can't leave her! That's all we can do! Kate, we're going! Please. Come on! Come with me. Come on! We... we... (Ruth) You've been here too long. Let me help you pass over. Mischka. Mischka, I only want to help you. Please... listen to me. I can help you find peace! [eerie sounds] [creature screaming] [silence] [Ruth groaning] [Ruth gasping] Let me help you. [eerie sounds] Please. Let me help you find peace. [eerie high-pitched sounds] Come with me. Come with me. You've suffered far too long, Mischka. I can help you. I can help you. There is release for you. Let me guide you. [gasping] [soft growling] Let me help you. [heavy breathing] [male voice groaning] [Ruth screams] [both screaming] [heavy breathing] [silence] (Kate) Told you she'd be here! (Matt) Ruth? Ruth. Can you hear me? Ruth. What happened? [Ruth moans] Something's different. The building's so quiet. Ruth, are you hurt?! No. [moan] She says no. Look at this. Jesus Christ. Ruth, is this place safe? Yeah, it's safe. [groan] He's gone. I led him to peace. [groan] I led him to peace. Don't touch me. (Kate) Okay. [Ruth, straining] Can you walk? Oh. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm going to go back to the control room, get the laptops. Let's get the cameras. [Ruth, gasping] I'm just going to lie down in here for a bit. (Kate) Take your time. We'll get the stuff out of the control room. We'll leave when it gets light. [gasping] Yeah. We can't carry all of this. Just carry what you can. Just make sure we've got the footage. How's Ruth gonna walk all the way back? We'll have to help her. I need to get my camera. Okay. You were right. About what? Going back for her. If we'd left her, that would have stayed with us. Yeah. [groaning[ [distant eerie noise] Matt? Matt? [gasping] [continues gasping] [eerie noise] [noise continues] [Kate, gasping] Fuck! [screams with frustration] [noise continues] [shriek] [eerie noise stops] [gentle snarling] [loud growling] [very distant screaming] [coughing] [whimpering] [whimper] David? David? Matt. Talk to me. Matt? Please? [click] [heavy breathing] [eerie noise] What have you done? [eerie voice speaking Russian]
