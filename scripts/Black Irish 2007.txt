It's the bottom of the ninth, two out, the winning run threatening on third. And the pitch. Swing and a miss. The count now 3-2. Grady pounds his bat on the plate in frustration. [horn honks] [bell tolling] Let's have a look. All right. You look fine. [door opens] [bell tolling] [chattering] Get rid of the gum. Swallow it. [swallows hard] Don't get your mother upset. [sniffling] What's with Kathleen? We barely even knew her. There's absolutely nothing wrong with her. She loved to sing. Go keep an eye on your brother. I'm sorry for your loss. Me and Anthony are going to a party later on. You wanna come? Save it, Terry. Not now. Yeah, whatever. Like she's gonna hear us. She looks really good, considering-- This old bat looks better now than when she was alive. [scoffs] How much would you pay me if I give her a kiss? T-Terry, not now. She's got a piece of snot hanging out of her right nostril. You think that's real, or you think they stuck that in there? Cut it out. This is Dad's sister. So what? She never said two words to me or to the old man. All right. Well, forget that now. She's dead, so just say a prayer or something. I don't know any. Eight years of Catholic school, and you don't know one prayer? Bless us, our Father, for these, thy gifts we are about to receive-- Not that. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll be out in the car. [Cole] Thy kingdom come, thy will be done-- [door opens] on earth-- [muttering] [door closes] Lead us not into temptation-- Lead us snot into temptation. Thank you. [chuckling] What are you doing, bro? What's it look like? Coming with us or what? Where to? I already told you. To a party, remember? Someone invited the two of you to a party? [chuckling] [scoffs] Forget about it. We don't need no pure alter boy hanging with us. Pure as your mother. Have you even seen a girl yet, huh? Look, forget it. I just thought since you never get out-- He coming or what? We got him. [rabbit cage opens] Guys, wait up. It's the O'Leary family. They went to the Cape. Big deal, right? [chuckling] I thought we were going to a party. [whispering] Shut up! What are you guys doing? [dog barking] I'll hold your coat. You're out of your minds. Don't puss out on us. You're the only one who can squeeze through. No, forget it. I'm not doing this. Quit dicking around and do as I say. Get off of me! Trying to say something, huh? I can't hear you. The only thing I hear is, "Okay, Terry, I'll do it." You're both assholes. We lower you in, you go upstairs and you open the door, okay? Okay? Bingo! [clock chiming] Come on. Come on! Come on, buttercup. Wake up. [clock chiming] [Boy] What you got, man? Anything good? [Terry] Watches. [Boy mutters, chuckles] Oh, Terry! Come here. Check this out. Nice. I'm keeping this, all right? Yeah. [car approaches] [Terry] Shit! Let's go. [Boy] Pop. Where's my brother? Forget about him. O'Leary's in the driveway, man! Cole! Cole! Get up! Come on, get up! Cole, pick your feet up! Come on. Get up! [door unlocking] [Man] Hey! Who the hell is that? Open the goddamn door! Come on! Come on, get up! Open the door! [knocking] Kathleen, I've brought you something. Can I come in? Yeah. Should call this "morning, afternoon and evening" sickness. I know you can't eat it now, but I made you a sandwich. It's important you eat. Oh, God, Ma, get it out. Peanut butter. I can smell it. You need the protein. I need to feel normal again. I know. I know. Does this mean you're not mad at me? Don't get the wrong idea, Katie. I'm still mad at you and that boyfriend of yours, but we'll get everything taken care of. You know what we discussed, Ma? It's not such a terrible thing. No child of mine is having an abortion. Oh, no. [dog whines] [Dad] No running in the house! Kid listens good. What's with you? My rabbit. I forgot to give her her medicine. Didn't make it, huh? Looks like it's gonna be rabbit fricassee tonight. [chuckles] Why don't you fellas go on ahead? I'll meet you later. If I'm late, I want a 20 on Early Warning. You got that? No problemo, Des. Yeah, I'd hustle if I was you. There's some good picks out there today. Oh, I know it. You think you can get one past your old man, huh? [door opens] What do you mean? [door closes] When you were crying like a girl, I smelled booze on your breath. You can't have it both ways. Either you cry like a girl or you drink like a man. What's it gonna be? You think you can drink like a man at your age, then follow through and do it. As my father used to say, "Save the tears for the cemetery 'cause they're wasted on me." Go ahead. Maybe you shouldn't drink, either. What did you say? Nothing. You know, maybe when I ask you what I should or shouldn't do, you'll know you're old enough to tell me. Drink. [spits] [retching] Clean up the mess. Any of your friends want a drink, you know where to send 'em. [growling] Not again. That's my goddamn shoe. [growling continues] Fine. Didn't fit right, anyway, you woolly-headed son of a bitch. [Priest] In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. [Cole] Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. How long has it been since your last confession? My last confession was about a week a-- a m-month ago. Go on, young man. I've had impure thoughts. I, uh, lied to my mother a while back, and my father. I swore during the Red Sox game when Varitek booted the bunt and they lost. I got drunk and robbed a house. Could you repeat that? I-- I've had impure thoughts. No. The last part. You mean getting drunk and robbing-- robbing a house. This is very disturbing, Cole. You know-- All those Sundays with you beside me, I should hope I recognize your voice. Father, I feel terrible. My brother suckered me in. Terry is not the issue here. You've gotta be stronger than that. There's a lot of bad in the world, and it's easy to gravitate toward the bad. Be left by the wayside. Do you understand? Yes, Father. [sighs] I want you to think about the clearest, purest thing that God has given you. Do you have any idea what that could be? Keep you focused. It's baseball. Baseball? [sighs] What about your plans to go into the priesthood? Father, you asked a question. That's what came out. All you got is that one pitch. Sooner or later, I'm gonna catch up to it. Come on. Let me see it. Let me see it. [clatter, cat yowls] That was our only ball. [Woman] Hey! What are you looking at? You old hagged-up bitch! Watch your mouth! [window closes] I guess the game's over, then. Cole, don't think you're anything special, okay? When it's a money pitch, I can throw like that, too. All right, Terry. Don't be late tonight. It's Kathleen's going-away dinner. Good hitting. Yeah, you, too. Mmm. Smells good. Fancy dishes. It's the good china. From your mother, remember? [chuckles] Haven't seen these in a lifetime. You kids were in diapers when I saw these last. You kids were all beautiful children. Weren't they? [Father chuckles] They were. Even Terry. [laughs] Terry? No way. Yeah. Where is he? I think I saw him outside with Anthony. Ah, the brain trust. Go get him, will ya? It's your sister's going-away dinner. It's okay. I'll go get him. [clears throat] It ain't fair. The whole ball of wax ain't fair. There's going to be another adjustment as well. Concerns you. Adjustment? In order to pay for your sister, we're taking you out of St. Mark's, putting you in public. [Cole sighs] That's Terry's school. I don't want an argument out of you. I'll make do. Raiders are the best team in the city. I won't even make that lineup. And Father Magruder said I have a good shot at being on the varsity starting rotation this year. Why you worry about something as trivial as baseball when you know your future lies in the priesthood. There you are, Terry. Perhaps you can show your brother around when he gets to your school. Gets to my school? Yes, Terry. You and your brother are going to be attending the same institution. You want me to give him a tour? That's a beauty. I-I don't know if that's such a good idea, Margaret. He's two years behind me. What am I gonna show him? Oh, I'm catching up, though. Have a seat, please, so your sister can say grace. I'm not hungry. Yes, you are. It's your sister's goddamn dinner. You want me to eat all my vegetables? That's enough! Ah, this is just great. The Brady Bunch got nothing on us. What a sham all this is. Is anyone here really happy? Terry, calm down now, mmm? You all think I'm dumb. I'm not dumb. I'm smart. Smart enough to know that if I study, I get a "C," if not, I get a "C" minus, so why bother, huh, Ma? You and I both know you could do much better than a "C" if you just applied yourself. It's easier bein' a loser. Nobody expects anything out of Terry McKay. Nobody here gives a good goddamn about me or what I want, and none of you care. Terry, that's not true. Oh, it's not? Then what's my favorite color? What's my favorite baseball team? Hey, Dad, how come I didn't wanna go to camp when I was eight? Terry, I don't wanna hear it! It's not about you tonight. The money pitch. Come here! Think you're smart? That's enough. Stop it! [blows landing] [dog barking] [Dad] Damn it! [engine starts] [door closes] [footsteps approaching] Add one more to the collection. You'll have to take on this wonderful chore while I'm gone. I'm so sorry they had to pull you out of St. Mark's. It's all right. I'm actually-- I'm kind of looking forward to it. Change is good, right? Yeah, and you'll do fine. You'll be so far ahead you won't have to do any homework for two years. There'll be girls. I heard rumors they exist. [sighs] Yeah. By tomorrow this should be dry. Then you hang the hook. Three inches above the hole? Mm-hmm. Are you gonna be okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna be fine. You should go to bed. Pulling you out is probably a temporary thing. I'll land another job. I got part-time work lined up already. As soon as your sister's taken care of, I get back on my feet, you're back on track for the seminary. It is what you want, isn't it? I'm not exactly sure I'm cut out for it. Since when? You know, since-- since I've been doing some thinking on some of the vows. Vows? Which ones? Well, chastity, for one. You know, I'm not exactly comfortable with the idea of being...chaste. That's a doozy. Are you getting laid? Are ya? Stop. No. But besides playing ball, it's all I can think about. Perfectly natural. Listen, from age 13 through my late 20s, all I could think about was pus-- w-was sex. Really? Really. Then I met your mother. Wait a minute. You know about the birds and the bees, right? You know how the whole thing works, don't you? Yeah, Dad, I know. Yeah, well, I know you know. Attending that institution doesn't exactly expose you to the world. Yeah, well, I got it figured out. Well, you know, it's not like you see in Playboy. You know, it gets all wet-- I-- You know, this-- That's okay, you know? But not too much. And, uh, [clears throat] always, always gift wrap your package. You know, protection. We're gonna-- We're gonna be late. Uh-- [clears throat] Yeah. [car approaching, radio blaring] # Everything that we believed in, it all turned out to be a lie # [car, radio off] [car door opens, closes] Taking matters into your own hands? Is your boyfriend David gonna drive the bus? The faggot. Go away, Terry. I don't wanna deal with you right now. Come on. Get in. I'll drive you... wherever you wanna go. You know you have a fine, young ballplayer here. Why, next season I'd wager he'll make it into the starting rotation. There isn't gonna be a next season, Father. We're taking our son out of St. Mark's. Out? I've always thought that Cole was here because his faith was central to him. Have you found something more important in your life? No. No, Father. Not-- Not at all. It's, um-- It's the most important work a man can do. It's just-- It's-- It's just that-- Yeah. Right now-- No one becomes a priest nowadays. I don't want my son to become some sort of freak. He's going in a different direction. Isn't that right? Mr. McKay, I'd hardly label our calling freakish. Well, you might wanna consider getting the Church a good publicist then, because, uh, you know, your calling's been taking a serious hit lately. Here's the bottom line: The kid's hormones have finally kicked in. He's no longer interested. Isn't that right? Not exactly. Have you made any short or long-term plans? I'm gonna go to public school, and, uh, I thought I'd work as a waiter. For now. [sighs] You've been such a promising student. Exemplary in all ways. And now you'd prefer to serve hamburgers instead of God? It's a lot more practical. McDonald's has served a few more than Catholicism has. How many billions they up to now? [chuckling] This is not to be made light of, Mr. McKay. By choosing this path, your son may very well be stepping into the abyss. Here he has a home and-- and a future. Out there-- Every man has these urges that you're feeling. By denying them, we make ourselves stronger, holier. Am I not right, Cole? Yes, Father. Yeah, that's a crock if ever I heard it. No wonder you guys are so out of touch. What you feel right here-- that tingle in your nuts-- is the most natural thing in the universe. It says you're alive, and no amount of praying is gonna make it go away. It's what makes the world go around. You deny that, you deny who you are. I had no idea that such a fine young man could come from someone who has such disdain for God and his deeds. Come on, Cole. It's time to go. Cole, come on! We told him! Huh? What's the matter? You're a free man. What do you say we go celebrate, get ourselves a couple of beers at O'Reilly's? What the hell. You're almost old enough. No hard stuff, I promise. Dad, I was thinking, now that I'm at public, maybe I could get a job, bring in some money. How about-- How about dropping me at Marcellino's? You're aiming high. Want me to come in? No, it's all right. I'll come and tell you when to pick me up. Can you spare some change? Fuck off. God bless. [footsteps approaching] Damn her. Who? Mom. I can't do it. [chattering] [Man] Is that coffee done? Can I help you with something? Yeah, I'm looking for the owner. You're looking at him. Start yakking. Oh, well, um, I'm from the neighborhood, and I was just hoping that you could use me. For what? Restaurant work. Yeah? You ever waited tables? Uh, no. Bussed? No, sir. Washed dishes? Actually, yeah, all the time. Whereabouts? Don't tell me. At home. Yeah. Tell me this is a recent career decision. Well, I just decided the other night, but I really wanna work here. Yeah? I got a bunch of Dominicans in the kitchen. You know why? No. 'Cause illegals work cheap and hard and they don't know enough English to give you any lip. It's tough to compete with that. Okay, well, I could-- You could pay me as much as you pay them. Less, even. I'll work even harder, and as many hours as you want. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Listen, I need to help out my family. Chip in. What's your name, kid? Cole. I'm Cole McKay. Nice to meet you. Joey Colasanto. All right. Here's what we do, Cole McKay. You're gonna be my utility man. That means you do whatever I need. It could be washing dishes, delivering meals, parking cars, whatever. You old enough to drive? Yeah. I could ask you your birthday, or I could trust you. Feel blessed I hate math. There's a delivery van out back. Make sure your feet hit the pedals, adjust the mirrors, drive around a bit. Then you start tonight. You bang it up, you not only get canned, you wind up paying me back for the rest of your life. Got it? Yeah, I got it. Thank you so much. You-- You're not gonna be sorry. You better hope not. [Woman] Kathleen McKay, right? Yes, that's right. I'm Sister Mary Elise, your intake counselor. Do you prefer Kathleen or Katie? I call her Katie. Kathleen. Let her help you. I'll see you inside. Do you have everything you need? Absolutely everything a girl could want. This is the best thing, Katie. You'll understand someday and-- Thank you for it? Yes, that's right. It's just hard for you to see that now. I'll call you later. Good-bye, Ma. Well, look who decided to join us to pursue an education, huh? All bright and shiny for his first day. You bring your multivitamins? Where were you last night, Terry? Don't sweat it. I was around. [sighs] Those my pants? Yeah. So? So they're my pants. Did you steal 'em? No, I didn't steal them. They were in the dryer. I ran out of mine. I didn't say you could borrow those. Hey, it's not a big deal. Take off my pants. I'll get 'em back to you. [stammering] No way. Take off my pants now. Terry, I'm not taking off the pants. Just forget it. That's a smart move, alter boy. Nobody touches my brother but me! You got that? Nobody! One last chance. Okay! Geez! Okay! You sure? Maybe you should keep 'em on you. They look good on you. Forget it. Okay. Take 'em off? Okay. Oh! [quiet snickering] [Girl] Nice legs. [dog growling playfully] Why is it only my shoes, huh? I've had it with you, you Kraut bastard. [whistling] [door opens] [Teacher] This is going to be true of each and every right triangle we encounter where "C" is the hypotenuse, or the long side, and "A" and "B" form-- Mr. McKay, correct? Yes, sir. Cole McKay. Any relation to Terry McKay? Yeah, he's my brother. Ohhh! Take a seat. Thank you. Now, where was I before I was so rudely interrupted? Ah, yes. The Pythagorean theorem. As this example shows-- I saw what happened at the bus stop. Oh, yeah? Not exactly my day. [chuckles] Your brother's out of control. Nah. Nah, he's not-- he's not so bad. Not so bad? Look, I was a new kid once, too. I'm Donna. [Teacher] Congratulations, Mr. McKay. You just earned yourself a detention. Come on, boy. Come on. Out of the car. [barks] Attaboy. Come on. Come on, King. Get out of the goddamn car! [whines] You gonna resist this, huh? Are you gonna resist that, huh? You mongrel. Here, King. Here, King. [whistles] [growling] You're pretty goddamn smart, aren't ya? I know you know what I'm talking about. Holding out for the good stuff. Thinking I won't make the sacrifice. [growling] Huh? [yells] [barks] Who's the king now? [King barking] Who's the king now? Red Sox have had a couple of fine defensive plays already in this game. The play on one, and the play by Jos Cruz Jr. [door closes] [Spanish on TV] [whistles] [clicks tongue] Dad, have you seen King? He must've got out. Come to think of it, I haven't seen him all day. I'm gonna go take a look for him. He'll show up. You know, I know you watch baseball on here. [baseball game on TV] You do, huh? What are you, Mata Hari? [chuckles] Looks like a good game. [TV, indistinct] There's a beautiful motion. The pitch, it's high and inside. There's a lousy pitch. Uh-huh. What he just did, that there's control. High and inside, pushed him right back. You throw a few low and away, they crowd the plate, adjust to you, and then you fire one at the head. Keeps 'em honest. You gotta keep 'em honest. [TV continues, indistinct] I'm working on my splitter right now. It's still light out. How about me and you go have a ca-- This one's dead. Grab me a cold one, will ya, kid? How was school today? Not so hot. I got a call from your teacher. What happened? Missed the bus. You've never been late in your entire life. And here on the first day at a new school? I'm sorry, Ma. I won't permit you to become like Terry. Your father might, but I won't. Two peas in a pod. There's no room for a third. I'm not like Terry. Words are words. Actions define who you are. Wish me luck. [Girl] Are you sure you wanna do this? Ain't no cakewalk raising a kid alone. Don't listen to her. You got serious balls. I'll see ya. You were having a hard time with that last week. Is that getting better now? [ringing] A little bit. Excuse me. Social Services. Margaret McKay speaking. Yes. What? What do you mean, "missing"? Sandy, something's come up. We'll have to reschedule. Okay. I'm sorry. I catch anyone stealing any more goddamn shrimp, and I'll rip your arms off! Everyone hear me? No more shrimp! I feed you, I pay you, and you do this? Learn some respect! I'm sorry. Joey-- Joey, I can-- I can bus tables. I don't even-- You need another guy out there. I don't even like shrimp. You wanna bus tables? Uniform's in the back room. Don't go near the bar. Want no Micks near the liquor. And work on growing a mustache or something. Look older, would ya? All right, kids, you ready? Call me, okay? [dishes clatter] What's your name, son? Cole. Cole McKay. Graves! Step down. Come on, McKay. Maguire! Step in, hit against McKay. [grunts] This'll be fun. Not bad. Maguire, where you goin'? Get back in there. You're not done gettin' humiliated. Show me the breaking stuff. All right, yeah. [Boy] Come on, knock it out of the park! Well, that just hung there. Work on it. [doorbell rings] Hi. Hi. You really look beautiful. Oh. I'm not ready just yet. Yeah, no, I'm probably a little early anyway. These are for you. They're beautiful. Come on in, please. So, you can wait in the living room while I just finish getting ready? Yeah. Okay. [clock chimes] Did you always have this bird? What do you mean? Uh...did you just buy it? Sonny? No, I've had him since I was a little kid. Isn't it beautiful? Yeah. I take him with me wherever I go. Can I pet him? No, just wait till I help you. [thud] Oh! Oh. I've really been looking forward to this. I-I'm sorry. [Father] That was quick. Shoulda learned to chew your food slower. Didn't go too well. Didn't get any, huh? No. I killed her bird. That's a new expression on me. Not exactly a good thing, is it? No, Dad, I-I literally killed her bird. Got out of the cage. Y-you killed... Sorry. Look, don't worry, You're just getting started. C'mon, you're young. You can still tolerate 'em. Y-you're not a bad-looking kid. Look, all you gotta do is figure out what they wanna hear. You're in like Flynn. [sighs] I guarantee you one thing, though: each and every one of them has some new and nutty perspective on the world. Gee, thanks, Dad. Don't mention it. [dog barking] [door opening] King! King, come on boy! Yeah, baby, come here! King! Come on baby, come on. Come on, King, oh what's up, buddy? Ohhhh.... King, I missed you! You're all dirty. [dog whining] Where'd you go? Where'd ya go, King? I missed you so much. Come here. Come on. [Joey] Where's my utility man? Cole? Where the hell are you? Right here, Joey. I want you to drop everything and deliver this. It's going to Tommy Orsini, he's at Skip's. He's a very important man to this restaurant and to my family, you understand? Yeah, I got ya. All right. Hey, there's my chow. All right, bring it over here, kid, come on. All right, shine's over. Here. Come on, kid, bring it over. You got me waiting here a half hour, come on. Here, come here. Here, you keep the change, all right? Give my best to Joey. What the hell is going in here? [sobbing] [sniffles] Did Orsini mess with you? Did he? Well, what then? Orsini just threw money at him like he was some $200 a week stiff. Threw money at who? My father, and he just stood there. What was your old man doing at the barber shop? He was sh-shining shoes. You didn't know he worked there? What a loser. Hey. He's trying to put food on the table, no shame in that. Then how come he couldn't look me in the eye? Just 'cause he don't like it don't mean it's not honorable. [panting] Go home. He's family. His luck will turn. Things always get better. Come on. Sorry about the mess. Don't worry about it. What's the matter, doc? Seen a ghost? I'm afraid the news isn't good, Mr. McKay. The latest MRI shows it's spreading. How long we talking? Well, it's hard to say. Have you put your affairs in order? My affairs? Oh sure, doc, sure. Taxes are all paid up, college funds set up for all the kids, Margaret, she's the beneficiary in a huge insurance policy I've been contributing to since day one. Everything's squared away. You given any consideration to quitting drinking? Why? So when I'm putting my affairs in order I can see how fucked up they are? Look, I'm sorry, you're just doing your job. I kinda knew what the news was gonna be. Half my family is underground by the time they're 40. I'm trying to think what I should do. As a last hurrah. There's a lot of stuff I haven't done. Never caught a foul ball at Fenway. Never swam in the ocean, y'know. It's right there, for Christ's sake. I can't figure out what to do. How the hell do you wrap things up? You haven't told anyone? You need to share this with your family. Right. Same stuff as last time. Gimme a call. Here. [sports chatter] [sports chatter] Safe! [Umpire] Time out! Time out! [groaning] Okay, okay. Come on. Can you get up? Smitty! That was intentional, blue! [sports chatter] [Umpire] All right, batter up! Hold up! Play ball! Ball. [Man] Hey! Watch your pitcher over there! [crowd noise] Told ya I'd get in the game one day! [chatter] [dishes clatter] You look great, Katie. Really, you do. Do you have any idea how long I've been looking for you? For about as long as I've been hiding. Can we talk? Manny, I need a break. Take five. Have you and David gotten married? This? No. He would never stand up to his parents in a million years. This is so respectable people such as yourself don't get the idea that an unmarried pregnant girl is serving their eggs. Slinging eggs and ham is not the answer. It just doesn't make any sense. Did it make sense to marry dad when you were pregnant with Terry? Thank you, but I'd rather go it alone and take my chances. You think that's why your father and I got married? Don't sit there and tell me that's not the reason, Ma. I know that's the reason. Let me tell you a story. I was 22 when I came to Boston. I was a beautiful young woman then and I don't mind saying so. One night, I met the most handsome man. Wonderful dancer, beautiful singing voice, kind. He was like no one I'd ever known before. On our first date, we went to this little Mom n' Pop Italian place in the North End. Wherever we went, someone knew him and was glad to see him. He was everything I was I was looking for. I gotta get back inside. I'm not finished. Somewhere along the way your father stopped being my.... ...he just stopped being. So I took a job and raised the family. Yes, I failed in parts. But make no mistake, I gave you a good start. Well-spoken and courteous, you know how to present yourself and you didn't get that from your father. Everything your father had to give your brother Terry took. He'll pay a price for it someday, but... before you decide on raising this child, be damned sure you've got the nerve, not just the love to raise it, to go the distance with that child, even when nothing else in your life works. It takes more than you know, Kathleen, and more than you've got. What about you? You stayed in a dead marriage for years, and for what, Ma? So people would think we were a normal family? We're not. Terry was right. Terry was not right. I'll raise this child to be proud, not ashamed. He won't be thrown into some Catholic school or some seminary to wipe away the guilt of his mother. I won't give up on this baby like you gave up on Terry. You take that back! Does this mean you won't be coming over for Christmas or Easter? McKay! Coach? How's the arm feel? Like it's been run over. Graves separated his shoulder. That means if we make it past the semis I'm gonna need you for the finals, too. Can you be ready? I'm ready now. You sure? Why wouldn't I be? Genealogy...you know what that is? Yeah. It's about your family tree. Good or bad, you come from the family you come from. I knew your father, growing up. Hell, back then anybody who knew anything about baseball heard of him. He had a gift, and he just threw it away. So let's just say I'm keeping my eye on you. Hey. How did you do today? You should've been there. I pitched a good game. So we win or what? Yeah, we won. Good for you. Maybe if you showed up to a game once in a while and actually took an interest you wouldn't have to ask. Hey, just because I wasn't there doesn't mean I don't care. I got tied up today, that's all. How's the elbow? That's good. Keep it iced. If you're going to pitch soon, lay off the breaking stuff in practice. Put some ointment on it. Look dad, honestly, can we just stop this? There's no point. I'm trying to tell you something-- something important here. What makes you advice so good, huh? Look how far it got you. [train whistle blows] [door slams] That's right. Reach out and grab for your own demise. Trust me, one more beer is not going to make a bit of difference. Looks like you'll be joining me, eh, Maggie? Desmond, we haven't done anything jointly in years, this is no time to start. Yeah, for good reason. Always gotta keep knocking me down, Maggie. Hold me in contempt every step of the way. How did you become the Queen of Pessimism? I married the king. Now we've got a dynasty. A whole lineage we've passed on these champion traits to. Don't start with me, please. Not tonight. Big man Desmond McKay. Big Vietman war hero. You fight all your battles in your head. Leave nothing left for anyone else. What do you bring to this house? Name one thing. You're stewed, Maggie. I deserve to be stewed. I'm the only one who tries to keep this family together. Shut up! Shut your trap! Stop it. Scram, kid, it's between your mother and me. We had all the promise in the world. For Chrissake. That's enough. Both of you. This doesn't concern you! And now look at you. How in the world could I have been so wrong? Not in front of the boy, Maggie. I'm warning you. Or else what? As if anything you've ever done has ever mattered. [dog barking] Look what you made me do! That's enough! [dog barking] Get out. [Terry] I heard Mr. Baseball got his team in the state finals! That curve ball is moving pretty good on you. Where did you get the new wheels? I earned 'em. Come on. Would you lighten up? Have some of this. Did you hear about good old Desmond? Do I have to? You're gonna want to hear this. He's a dead man. He's got the big C. That's bullshit. He told you? Everything I needed to know was in his coat pocket. He had a pocket full of these. I asked Anthony's uncle, the pharmacist, what they were. They give 'em to cancer patients in the late stages for the pain. What's your problem, Terry? Don't you feel anything? Yeah. Relief. Relief. Where you going? I'm through being out here with you. Then let's go. Take the new car out for a spin. You don't want me driving that. You pitched a good game today. You deserve to drive a real car. Not like them old fart cars you park at Marcellino's. Oh, I get it. You're scared to get in the car with me. Can you believe I spent $400 on this? $400 on a Goddamned rocket ship. The guy I bought it from, he cracked it up about a month ago, the frame was all bent, so I took it to this guy I know, big meathead. We did this barter deal. He fixed it right up. Runs pretty good, don't it? It's got a 350 V-8 engine under the hood. Said he did some shit to the engine and the exhaust. That gearhead shit goes in one ear and right out the other. # [hard rock, on radio] What's the matter with you, bro? I'm talking to you. Hey, what's wrong with you? [engine revs] [Terry] Slow down a little, I just got this! [Terry] Hey! Jesus, what are you doing? Hey! Wake up! [crashing] [horn blaring] [dogs barking] [horn continues blaring] [horn stops] Terry! [Terry gasps] Get out and push. You totaled my car. I'll make it up to you. Terry, you still bleeding? You're still bleeding. Get off! [police siren wails] Where do you boys think you're going? Probably to jail. [phone rings] [baseball game on TV] [phone rings] [Desmond] Hello? Yeah. Yeah. You're where? Let 'em think it over for the night. [sighs] So, how much trouble is he in? Basically none. You got a good kid here. Good pitcher, too. My kid's on the same team. I'd like to see them go all the way this year. Where's your brother? He was released on his own recognizance because he's old enough. We couldn't let this one leave on his own. So isn't there something you can charge him with? Excuse me? Nothing too serious. I come down all this way, it shouldn't be for nothing. Consider this your kid's lucky day, Mr. McKay. I mean, no one got hurt. We're gonna cut him a little slack. Yeah, well, somebody gotta teach him a lesson. So is it going to be you guys who should be doing their jobs instead of feeding my kid doughnuts, or me? Dad, they said we can go. I heard what he said. Move! Mr. McKay? [Officer] Take it easy on him. You don't want to wind up with two Terrys on your hands. Yeah, sure. Thanks for the profound insight. Put your seatbelt on. Don't you ever, ever humiliate me like that again! You understand me? I'm sorry. You should know better than to get in a car with Terry. What's the matter with you? Terry wasn't driving, Dad, I was. Don't pull that crap on me. Forget about Terry. Terry is beyond-- You I can do something about. You and me, we're gonna go back home and catch the doubleheader. [keys jingling] [Man] Right. Hey, listen, let me call you back. Someone just came in. Can I help you? Yes, sir. I've thought about this. I want to sign up. Serve my country. Please, have a seat. I know you. You're a local kid, right? McKay? Terry McKay. Son, do you know the Marine Corps motto? Yes, sir. Semper fi. Yes, there's that. There's also the few, the proud, the Marines. Right. With an emphasis on the few, which means we're very selective. You're not even out of high school yet and you've already got a criminal record. Son, I don't think you're Marine Corps material. It's got to be the Marines. I'm sorry, son. I can't help you. You guys are a bunch of pussies. [crowd cheering] [Announcer] Right field. Hit deep. Nixon on the run. [beer can opening] Right down the middle. [Announcer] It's gone. Should have never pulled Wakefield, you stupid bastards. You want me to turn it off? Don't you dare. Let's see how that son of a bitch does. You know what I like about this game? Baseball is exactly like life. The majority of the time, absolutely nothing happens. Then certain moments and certain days, you get all the glory in the world, or all the shit. You caught a break today, you know that, don't you? Yeah. You don't get too many. You should come out and see me pitch, Dad. I'm doing really good. We made it to state final. You don't want me to start turning up now, kid. You got a streak going, you go with it. Don't change a thing. Did you ever catch one? A break? Eh, a few here and there. Some people, life just happens to them. Don't put yourself in the position where you have no choice. Only choice I ever made was marrying your mother. You see how that turned out. Nah. I loved your mother. Sorry I'm late, Joey. Had to take care of something at home. Start in the dining room, then I'm going to need help with the cars. Don't forget, you're closing up with me tonight. Right, yeah. One more thing. Congratulations. I heard you made it into the finals. Yeah, thanks. Maybe when you make it into the majors, you can wear a Marcellino's patch on your sleeve or something. Hup! What do we got? Here we go. [Announcer] This part of the organization welcomes these guys back. Right down the right field line, that's trouble! Sheffield in the corner. A fair ball and a home run! Home run, Manny Ramirez! Still running hard. Three to nothing, Boston, in the first. I think they have arsenal right here. Posada is saying-- Yeah! [Announcer] Posada running down the right field line. Derek Jeter, team captain, verging towards-- [table crashing] Fuck! [Announcer] You can see it again on the replay. It appeared from here that although the ball was hooking, it was just inside the foul pole. Hey, Cole? How about giving me a hand with these, huh? I gotta hit the stock room. No problem, Joey. [Announcer on TV] It comes with all this, no-risk money-back guarentee. Desmond? [Announcer on TV] ...cigarette smoke, animal dander and-- [door opening] [door closing] We're closed. No shit. You owe me. Terry, get out of here. This isn't my money. You know who owns this place. Are you crazy? Makes no difference to me who owns it. It should. I said I'll make it up to you. All you gotta do is shut up and open the register. Just get out of here. [cocking gun] Open it. Anthony, don't point that thing at my brother, you hear me? Shut up! Drop the gun. [Joey groaning] Is this your place, you bastard? Both of yous are dead, you hear? Yeah, well, what if I kill you first, huh? Then, how are you gonna pay us back? Hey, genius. What do you think, I'm some lone fucking wolf here? I got plenty of friends that'd enjoy looking for yous, especially if I were dead. Well, then I guess I got no choice, huh? Anthony, don't! Jesus Christ! Hey, Cole, this one's your brother, right? Obviously he didn't get the brains in the family. At least I know how to find you. Shut up! I still got the gun! Open the goddamn drawer! You open it yourself, I'm not going to help you dig your own grave. It's for Dad, Cole. The money's for Dad, all right? No amount of money is going to make Dad better, Terry. Hey, Cole. You better call me an ambulance, I'm bleeding like a son of a bitch. No one's using the phone! Make sure he gets taken care of. Hey, Cole, one more thing. Only this guy robbed us. Your idiot brother had nothing to do with it, understand? No, Joey, no way, I'll say he was here if I have to. You little narc! Hey, asshole? This little narc's trying to keep you breathing. You know why I don't want you here, tough guy? I'll tell you why. So when they find you dead, the cops won't make a connection between you and me, you junkie piece of shit. Shut up! Fuck you! Don't you tell me to shut up! [cocking gun] Terry! Don't. You can't shoot me. We're family. You and me. Black Irish. You're more like black licorice. You're soft and sweet. You're hollow on the inside. We may be brothers, but I'm nothing like you. You got that right. [gun cocking] [gun fires] [police radio chatter] Come on, son. [hanging up phone] Can I go now, please? I'll take you over to the hospital. [EKG beeping] I'm sorry. Aw. I had no choice. Of course you didn't. I'm glad you're here. You go see your father. [EKG beeping] McKay. Go ahead. [chair dragging] [whispers] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallow-- Hallowed be thy-- Hallowed be-- [sniffing] [sniffing] Jesus, Terry, why'd you make me do it? [rain pelting window] What are you looking at? Doesn't look too bad up there. Hell no, it looks peaceful. Nice and quiet. No disappointed wife. No kids driving you up the wall. People admire you. How about we switch, huh? I'll go up there on the cross, you come down here and live in South Boston. Ahem. How long you been here? Since last night. Grab those clothes there, would you? [clearing his throat] [coughing] Nah, that's not such a good idea, Dad. Don't shovel dirt on me yet. Are you calling the shots now? You think you're a big man all of a sudden? Huh? Yeah. Maybe I am. Someone's got to be. You're not walking out of here until we talk to a doctor now-- Keep your hands off me. Get back in bed. Keep your hands off me. I'm not talking to any quack doctor and I'm not talking to you. [coughing] I'm tired of all this! You understand me? I am tired. You understand? Yeah, I got you. Loud and clear. Your favorite color was burgundy. Your favorite team was the Cincinnati Reds. You didn't go to camp when you were eight because you thought the kids would make fun of your ears. I know you, Terry, and I love you. It's just-- It's just been so very hard... to like you. Forgive me. [sobbing] How are they? Terry's going to make it. He'll face charges, but he'll make it. Your father-- How have you been? Fine. Look, uh-- here's my number. You ever want me to come by and help out in any way. Wait. I know you can do it yourself, but it's not just about you, Katie. I've heard all this before, Ma, I didn't come here for this, okay? I'm asking you to come home. I can help take care of the baby while you get on your feet. I don't want to lose another. I don't care how it looks anymore. I'll think about it, okay? I do miss my kid brother. # ["Star Spangled Banner" playing on P.A.] [anthem ends] [crowd clapping, cheering] [Man] All right, boys. [Man] All right, boys, come on! Sorry. You see that guy over there? Where? Him? No, don't point. A major league scout. He was asking about you. [coughing] Hey, where are you going? Dad. Are you all right, Dad? You want me to take you home? No. I'll take you home. No. I want to see you pitch. All right. I'll be here to check up on you though. Anyone crowds the plate, throw it right at their friggin' head. Keep 'em honest. [Coach] McKay, let's go. Got a game to play. [coughing] Cole! Hope I don't mess with your streak. [Umpire] Play ball! [crowd cheers] [Man] He's yours, McKay!
