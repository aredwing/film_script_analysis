The high today is a crisp 32 degrees with temperatures falling to the low teens by tonight. But our Weather Center predicts that no snow is expected in the city. It looks like this season is gonna be a disappointment, not only for those hoping for a white Christmas, but also for retailers everywhere as families cut back on nonessential items such as toys. The one bright spot is this year's must-have toy. Intellytron, the talking robot, is breaking sales records all over the country. Not since Tickle Me Elmo have we seen a toy fly off shelves as quickly as this. Great. Now we'll check back with our man on the street. Wonderful. And perfect. How's your cereal? Would you rather have French toast or eggs or something more fitting for the most important meal of the day? No, thank you. Dad and I always eat cereal for breakfast. Okay. He doesn't let me have Megapuffs. Why? He says the first ingredient in this cereal is cavity. Oh. Uh... Okay. Healthier... Mm-hm. Um... How about scrambled eggs? Sound good? All right. So I have a good idea. Tomorrow's Saturday. Why don't we go visit Santa? Are you past that? Aunt Holly, I'm 10. Right. Sorry. It's just when your dad and I were kids, there was always a present under the tree that nobody could account for. Grandma and Grandpa didn't buy it. It was always just there, waiting for us. Weird, right? Gabe? I need to get to school early, so I can get some extra help on my math homework. Well, I can help you. My teacher doesn't want you to "help" me anymore. Right. Yeah, math has changed so much since I was your age. Right. Can we just go? Sure. Aye, aye, captain, warp speed ahead. Star Trek? No? Never mind. Hang on. Hello? Hi, Lindy. Yeah, of course I have time to get your dry cleaning and your coffee. Uh-huh. My dad and I, we always go ice skating at Christmas time. That's a good idea. Ice skating at Rockefeller Center. Then we could decorate the tree, bake cookies and go shopping. I love Christmas. Cooking and shopping? You know I'm a boy, right? Some of the best chefs in the world are men. What I meant was we could go to a toy store, and get some ideas for boy Christmas presents. I already know what I want, Intellytron. Can we go look at them? All right, but you never know what's gonna be under the tree. Have a great day. Don't forget how special you are. Sorry. Bye. God bless you. That's strange. He said he wanted to see me right away? Did he say why? All right, I'll be right there. Thanks, buddy. Hey, hold up. Hey, can you hold up? # Dashing through the snow On a one-horse open sleigh # # O'er the hills we go # Hi, can I get a tall nonfat latte with extra whipped cream, please? Three-ninety. Okay. I know, nonfat, whipped cream? You must think that's odd. Freaky. It's for my boss. She hired me to be the marketing manager. Now she treats me like I'm her assistant. Here you go. # Jingle bells, jingle bells # Ahem. It's empty. You're all out of bucks. Really? Uh... Okay. I have cash. Um... Hang on. Here, let me get it. No, it's okay. I have it. It's fine. Don't worry about it. Look, just let the cute guy buy the coffee. I have to get to work. I actually am a personal assistant. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, you're welcome. I'll buy yours tomorrow. Okay. If you decide to come tomorrow. If not, I'll wait for another time. Not wait like I'm stalking you. I mean wait like a normal person, who sounds like a crazy person. Ahem. Jake Finley. Holly Wilson. Nice to meet you, Holly Wilson. You too, Jake Finley. Uh... Your dress is... Thank you, I designed it myself. It's reversible. You can wear it during the day. Then you flip it inside out, wear it in the evening if you have a date. Heh-heh. Did that sound like I was asking you out? Because I wouldn't. Not that you're not someone I would date. It's just I was explaining about the dress, and I'm gonna go now. See you later? It's a deal. Heh. It's a deal? What am I, a game show host? # One-horse open sleigh ## Morning, Betty. Morning, Jake. What's the mood like in there? He's been his warm, fuzzy self all morning. He gave me a big hug and asked me all about my cats. That bad? He's still mad that I hired a store Santa. You know how he feels about Christmas. I sure do. I tried sneaking this into the break room. Betty, you got that number yet? He refuses to use the intercom. I'm on it. Go on in. Wish me luck. Ahem. Good morning, Dad. Are you aware that the Intellytron is the hottest, most sought-after toy of the Christmas season? Yes. I believe that during these tough times people are gonna go back to basics. Old-school toys like train sets and board games. So with your experience of two months as manager of the store, you decided that the hottest toy should be unavailable at our store. Why do people send Christmas cards? To be nice? Look, Dad, when you made me manager, you said that I was in charge. People don't wanna buy plastic toys that break the first hour. Those toys are a waste of money. That waste of money is our profit margin. We depend on Christmas revenue to balance our bottom line. Toy sales are an essential part of that plan. So sales, that's all that matters? When I was a kid, you used to say that if you treat people with fairness and respect, the sales will follow. Ahem. While we're on the subject of Christmas, I would like to revive the tradition of Finley's employee Christmas party. I think it's important. Concentrate on bringing in customers and sales. I am convinced we're gonna sell out this toy department by Christmas. Christmas is in 10 days. I hope you're right. I'll resign. I'm willing to stake my job on this. You just did. Is she looking for me? I told her you were downstairs delivering sketches. Thank you. I cannot lose this job. How are things going with Gabe? Well, I fed him sugar for breakfast, helped him fail a math test, embarrassed him in front of his friends. Eh. Kids are resilient. Have you heard of Intellytron? That's what he wants for Christmas. What every kid wants. It should be easy to find. Okay. David's brother is coming to town this weekend. I was thinking that you could... No. No, thank you. First of all, I have no time to date, and second of all, David's brother is... Getting a divorce. Isn't he the one who pawned his wife's ring for Mets tickets? Like I said, he's getting a divorce. Ha-ha. Thanks, but I'll pass. Right now, Gabe is the only man in my life. What ever happened to Chaz? That tall guy with the Porsche? Well, it wasn't his car or his real name. Ooh. That happened to me once in college. Tad Hamilton... Oh. Ugh! Holly, finally you're here. There you go. It's cold. It's eight blocks to your favorite coffee place. I tried... Speaking of Holly being late, I need everybody to stay late tonight to help me get ready for tomorrow, when I'm going on the Home Shopping Channel to showcase my new Average Woman dress line. Every Woman. What? It's not your Average Woman line, it's your Every Woman dress line. I said that. Every woman deserves a Lindy Lowe dress. Now available in several department stores and online. I know your marketing strategy. I paid for it. Right. Um... I have to pick up my nephew at 6, when the after-school program closes. Your what? My nephew? Gabe? I told you about him. My brother Mike was deployed overseas... Okay, everybody. We all have to stay late tonight except for Holly, whose life is more important than ours. Sorry. I assume you will be at the studio tomorrow for my television debut? Of course. I'm excited about it. It's gonna be great. Well, let's hope so, considering it was your idea. Lindy. Have you had a chance to look at my sketches for the dress design? I run an entire company by myself. I barely have time for my own basic needs, and now you want me to mentor you? I hired you for marketing, not designing. You're right. I'm sorry. It's not a horrible idea, this little black dress of yours that's reversible and goes from day to night. I mean, it needs a great deal of work, and it's obviously not couture, but it's not a horrible idea. Thank you? Morning. Morning. Got you, you little weasel. Good morning. And welcome to Finley's Toy Department. May I help you? Help me? Yeah. Are you shopping for your children? Boys or girls? No, I... We have a huge selection of classic toys, so you follow me. I'm sorry. Um, uh... Who are you? "Mrs. Miracle. " Yes. Actually, I'm Mrs. Merkle, but they made a mistake on my name tag. I kept it because it sounds so hopeful at this time of year, don't you think? Ahem. I'm Jake Finley. Oh. It's a pleasure to meet you. Can I interest you in some puzzles or game boards? Oh, and we have Slinkys. This is Finley's Department Store. Oh, my. I am so silly. Of course. You're J.R.'s son. So you know my father then? Oh, only by reputation. No. See, I've never had the pleasure of meeting him, but I am so glad to have met you. Oh, I see you have your coffee. How did that go? Fine. Ahem. See, I'm the store manager. The manager? Oh, isn't that wonderful. You must be so proud. And the funny thing is, is I don't remember getting a call from Human Resources about you. Oh, well, I'm just here to help you save Christmas. And the toys are just flying off the shelves. Actually, the biggest one of all are the train sets. Train sets? Yeah. Well, how many have you sold? Two. Two? That's right. Oh. Have some Christmas cookies. My mother used to bake them just like this. The stars were always my favorite. Oh, I must bring a plate of these to your father. Uh... No. Please don't do that. Well, why not? My father doesn't celebrate Christmas. Could you excuse me for a moment, please? Oh, sure. Okay. I'll be right back. All right. Heh. Gloria, do you know anything about this new employee? I thought you hired her. Yeah. She was standing outside this morning wearing that name tag when we opened. Could you do me a favor? Could you call HR and see if they sent her? I will, yes. I think she might just be a confused old lady who wandered in off the street. You think so? Now, come on. Her name is Miracle. She says she's here to save Christmas. Unfortunately, we may need a miracle this Christmas. You have no idea. # Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh # # Over the fields we go We're laughing all the way ## A complete second set, just ask for shipping and handling. "Luke's galactic sidekick"? Intellytron, a technological marvel with state-of-the-art technology can now be at your command. Intellytron is unstoppable with an arsenal of futuristic weapons... Future, come on. Able to destroy his enemies on land and water, he will spring into action at the push of a button. With Intellytron, you have the ultimate weapon. There's no way it does that. I came from the future to join forces with you. Intellytron. Who'd even wanna play with that? Intellytron. Stupid. If you don't need anything, I'll be going. That will be all. Thanks for staying late to finish that report. Sure thing. Good night. Night. Betty. Betty, I threw these Christmas cards away this morning. Did you take them out of the trash? No, I didn't. Well, I... I don't understand. Never mind. Good night. Night. You remember what day tomorrow is, right? Of course, how could I forget? Christmas shopping in the city. I need extra lunch money next week. I had to borrow from the office today. I forgot to give you your lunch money? Again? Oh, I'm so sorry. How are you supposed to learn when you're too weak to concentrate? No big deal. Oh. Well, other than that minor fiasco, how was school today? Fine. I know how hard it is to start at a new school, and I know you miss your friends but I promise you that every day it's gonna get a little bit easier. You told me that last week. What's this? Oh, this is vegetable brown rice. What are these green things? The green things? That's zucchini and spinach that I put in the sauce. See? You get to eat what you love, and it's still good for you. That's what the Healthy Kids Recipe Book calls win-win eating. Mm. Yummy. Peanut butter and bananas? All right. No, no, wait, wait. Let's look at the window. Oh, look at all the toys. Okay, see, these are the toys from my childhood. Oh, you see that jewelry box? I used to have one just like that. I loved that jewelry box. I wonder if it plays music when the little ballerina goes around inside. They don't have it. What? Intellytron. Why don't they have it? They'll probably have one inside. Let's go look. Yeah. Okay, you ready? Could you help us, please? Oh. Well, hello. Hi. Welcome to Finley's. "Mrs. Miracle"? Oh, no, actually, it's Merkle, but you can call me Miracle. Well, my nephew wants to look at... Intellytron? How did you know? Everybody wants that for Christmas. So do you have one? Not one. But we do have some tried-and-true toys. Toys that have withstood generations of children. Come on with me. Let's go to the fun zone. Ha-ha. Go ahead. Attention shoppers, welcome to Finley's. Santa's Workshop will be open until 4 p. m. Today. Santa's Workshop is located on the fourth floor. Toby wants a bone. Hmm. Scratch my belly. Meeting the love of your life depends on the effort you put into it. Look around you. Hi. Hi. You work here? Yeah. You shop here? Yeah. Is that your son? No, that's my nephew. His mom passed away a couple years ago and his dad, my brother Mike, was deployed overseas so he's been with me for a couple months. Oh, that's great. It's not great. That's a horrible story. It's great that you have a nephew. Uh... It's okay. Thanks again for buying me coffee. You're welcome. You know when you'll be getting Intellytrons? No, honey. But, you know, Christmas is about a different gift, one God gave to us many years ago. Jesus. Right. That's right. You just have to remember that Christmas is about that very special gift. And anything else you get for Christmas is just like extra powdered sugar on a Christmas cookie. I still wanna know when you'll be getting in some more Intellytrons. Come here. Let's go tell Santa. See him way down there? Go tell him what you want for Christmas. Go on, go tell him. I hope you don't mind, but I suggested to Gabe that he tell Santa what he wants for Christmas. Oh, thank you. I wanted to get a picture of him sitting on Santa's knee to send to his father. You know, the store Santa was Jake's idea. Well, thank you. Must be hard on kids whose parents serve in the military. Especially at Christmastime. Yeah, it is. We don't expect his father for another nine months. Oh, my. Oh, excuse me. Hello? Gabe is lucky to have you. You love him, and he knows it. Your efforts will be rewarded. It's a great opportunity to reach a wide audience, so don't worry, you're gonna be wonderful. And being on the Home Shopping Channel expands your customer base. You're gonna sell a million dresses. I think you're right. I'm a natural for television. I should have done this a long time ago. Why didn't you recommend it sooner? I did, but... Oh, Gabe. Lindy, I'd like you to meet somebody. This is my nephew, Gabe. Nice to meet you. I pictured you bigger. Is that what 10-year-olds look like? I guess so. Are you sure? Hmm. Um... Hey, Lindy, another way to expand your sales would be to market to larger-size women. Why do you keep bringing that up? The plus-size market is not built for high fashion. Well, I'm not talking about plus-size so much as normal size. Your dresses only go up to a size 10, but because of the cut, they only fit a size eight and most women wear a 10 or a 12. When I start designing for women who have let themselves go, it's the day I am out of the fashion business. Is that what I look like? I thought I looked younger. You look really nice. Well, thank you, young man. Goodness, is that your lunch? It was in my purse. I believe I sat on it on the subway. Oh, well, lucky for you, I brought just enough for two. Is that ropa vieja? Uh-huh. My grandmother used to make that for me on Christmas. Really? She said, "Buena comida es el corazn de la familia, " which means... "Good food is the heart of the family. " You speak Spanish? How long have you worked here? I have worked for Finley's Department Store for 30 years. That's a long time. Oh, Mr. Finley Sr. Must be very good to his employees. He is. We don't see much of him since his wife died. He used to be on the floor working with us the whole day. He used to throw the most amazing Christmas party across the street at Vincenzo's for all the employees and their families. Well, Mr. Finley Sr. Is a very handsome man. Have you met him? No, no, no, he just sounds like he's handsome. I called HR... Heavenly Resources? Human Resources. Oh, right. Right, that's what I meant, yeah. They never heard of you. Really? Well, that's not so surprising. I mean, they hire so many people at Christmastime, but I'll straighten things out. Thank you. This close to Christmas, we all have parties to attend. That means we need the perfect dress to wear. We're lucky to have fashion designer Lindy Lowe on the show today. Welcome, Lindy. For the first time, we are offering Lindy Lowe designer dresses, size zero to 10, to the general public at affordable prices. Tell us more about your new Every Woman line. Thank you, Clair. I am so happy to be here to offer a bit of sophistication and flair to the average woman who ordinarily would not think to dress with any real style. I think what Ms. Lowe means is that all women want to dress like fashion models. We all wanna make heads turn, don't we, girls? Right, we all want to look like we just stepped off the cover of Vogue, as unlikely and delusional as that sounds. I'm in so much trouble. Lovely evening. "Mrs. Miracle"? Yes. Miracle, Miracle... We do not have an employee at Finley's named Miracle. And I pride myself on knowing the name of every employee, including seasonal staff. Actually, it's Mrs. Merkle. But they made a mistake with my tag, so I just kept it because it has a nice ring to it. I still don't recognize the name. Well, I wouldn't let it worry you. We're all getting older. They say the first to go is the eyes, then the mind comes close behind, and, suddenly, you and your teeth are sleeping in separate beds. I beg your pardon? You used to spend your days working alongside your employees. Now you don't come out of your office. You can't expect to know all your employees if you don't interact with them. And they miss you. What department do you work in? Toys. I work for your son, and he's doing a marvelous job managing this store. Where is my son? He was supposed to be here at 6:30. Oh, you didn't get the message? I'm sorry. No, he had to cancel. He's doing inventory. Well, then, good night, Mrs. Merkle. Good night. Mrs. Merkle, do you need a ride? No, thank you. I have a ride. But I have a feeling that Gloria could use a ride. Gloria? Yes? Mr. Finley has offered to take you home. You live six blocks away from him. Did you know that? How do you know where I live? Well, goodness, you've lived in the same place for 30 years. Come on, honey, hop in. But... Well, I guess it will be okay. That's awfully generous of you, Mr. Finley, but I wouldn't like to take you out of your way. Gloria. Gloria Martinez, right? I remember you. You've worked for me for a long time. You started in the shoe department. What an amazing memory. Well. Heh. Yes, sir. I have worked for you for 30 years. I remember you. You used to wear your hair down and curly. Yes. Well, please, after you. Ha-ha-ha. Okay. Good night. Bye. Good night. There's a nice caf for dinner at 77th and Madison Avenue, in case you get a flat tire in the area. Was that my father's car pulling away? Oh, I believe so. We had dinner plans tonight. Frankly, I'm happy to get out of it. I don't know if I could stomach an entire dinner of I-told-you-sos. Well, you followed your instincts, and that's a wonderful quality. If you plan to run this store someday, you'll have to trust your own judgment. I don't think my father is ever gonna retire. Thank you for all the hard work you've been doing. Your Christmas spirit has been contagious around here. I do love Christmas. Gloria tells me you used to give a big Christmas party for all of your employees across the street. Yeah, we did. We don't do that anymore. Oh. My mother, she died on Christmas Eve, so my father thinks it's disrespectful if we celebrate. Oh. I don't think so. In fact, I miss celebrating Christmas with everyone. You love this store, don't you? Yeah. Yeah, it's like a second home. Well, why don't you stand up for yourself? Tell him how you feel. Well, you're a Finley too. Has anyone ever told you that you can be very nosy? Oh, yes, every day. Sometimes twice a day. I'm gonna catch a cab. Or you could walk home. It will relax you and clear your head. Yeah, I suppose you're right. The city is beautiful this time of year, vendors selling roasted chestnuts. Maybe I'll grab a bag, huh? He's wrong, you know. Ahem. I beg your pardon? Your father is wrong to think that celebrating Christmas is disrespectful to your mother. Celebrating anything in her memory honors her. Good night, Mrs. Merkle. Good night. Roasted chestnuts. It's a tradition. You wanna get some? Yes. Okay. Jake, again. Holly, again. We keep running into each other. It appears that way. Three bags, please. You live around here? No, we're coming back from ice skating. Oh, nice. When I was your age, Thank you. My mother used to buy me a bag of roasted chestnuts, and we'd go for a ride in a carriage around the park. Can we get a ride? Please? Well, I don't think we have a choice. Down Fifth Avenue, please, sir. Okay, careful. Thanks. This is so cool. Giddyap. I wish it would snow. It's not Christmas unless it snows. I don't think that's gonna happen this year. See that? That's the only toy Gabe wants. The only problem is Santa can't seem to find one. Oh, that toy could cost me my job. What? I decided not to stock it in the store. Why not? I think kids should have toys that spark their imagination, you know? It's... When I was a kid, I had these plastic toy soldiers I used to play with in the backyard, in the dirt, for hours, fighting imaginary battles, defending imaginary castles. I played with the same green and yellow jump rope for an entire summer. I was afraid that was gonna happen. It's been a long day. My apartment's just around the corner. You could take my car service home. Oh, it's okay. I appreciate it, but we can take the bus. I live in Brooklyn. I have a car service that I pay for that I never use. I am sure they make fun of me behind my back. You'd be doing me a favor. Okay. Ha-ha. Okay. Seeing Christmas through the eyes of a child, it's kind of like living it all over again, you know? Yeah. Well, here we are. You live here? Finley. Finley as in Finley's Department Stores? I just put that together now. It's okay. It's a common last name. All right, big guy, here we are. Just hop right in, okay? Well, thank you, again. You're welcome. Good night. Good night. Hey, do you wanna go out sometime? I'm not really dating right now. Um... Between Gabe and work, I just... I don't have any free time. Me neither. How about Monday night? Well, I don't have anybody to watch Gabe. I haven't left him alone for a night since his dad went away. Then why don't I bring dinner to you? Both of you. That would be wonderful. Okay. Monday night? Chinese food? That's my favorite. Mine too. Okay. All right, then. Thank you. Good night. There's nothing like roasted chestnuts to bring people together. Mrs. Merkle, you're in early. I like to get a jump start on my day. Ha-ha. Oh, I like your hair like that. It's very festive. Thank you. I always used to wear it like this. I don't know why I stopped. How was your weekend? The strangest thing happened. Mr. Finley drove me home Saturday night, and we got a flat tire right in front of this little coffee shop, so we decide to go in and have dinner. We have a lot in common. My husband died the same year his wife died. Imagine that. Yeah. Good morning, Gloria, Mrs. Merkle. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Finley. How was your weekend? Fantastic. I made myself a new scarf. What do you think? Oh, it's lovely. And how was your weekend? It was very nice. I ran into Holly Wilson and her nephew, Gabe, on Saturday night. Oh, great. Did you make another date? Oh, sorry. Is that too nosy? Actually, I did, yes. I am taking dinner to her apartment tonight. Oh, and I know a great restaurant with takeout Chinese food. Of course you do. See you later. What's up? Ugh. I'm trying to find an Intellytron for Gabe for Christmas. It's all he wants, and they're sold out everywhere. Oh, here. You gotta go on SuchHotStuff. Com. Where you can find sold-out and hard-to-find stuff. I got Donny and Marie concert tickets there last month. Did you just say Donny and Marie? Don't judge. You think they're gonna have an Intellytron on here? Yes, but they'll be selling hundreds over cost. I don't have hundreds over cost. Hey, how did Saturday go at the Home Shopping Show? I don't think there were many sales. And she managed to offend most of the viewers. And I'm pretty sure she's gonna find a way to make it my fault. In my office. Now. See? Ugh. I cannot believe I let you talk me into going on that stupid show. People with taste don't buy clothing off the television. Their main audience is probably prisoners or shut-ins. It's all part of the new marketing plan. I thought it would expand your client base and reach out to women who never shop in the designer department. Well, you were wrong. Women who shop off the TV don't wear nice clothes. They wear prison jumpsuits or robes around the house all day and then they call it a housecoat. You should visit some of the shops where we've expanded your line. Take a look at your buyers beyond the designer shops on Madison Avenue. Get to know your core customers. You want me to go to a retail store and look at people? Ordinary people? Ugh. What is this? Another one of your marketing "ideas"? No... Yes. Uh... Only one week till Christmas. Sales are steady, but there's no way we sell this out. I wouldn't worry. Most people wait till the last minute to go shopping. Dad. What are you doing here? You never come down here. Elevator is being serviced, I had to use the stairs. I have to pass through the toy department in order to leave the store. It's nice to see you, Mr. Finley, out of your office. Oh, hello, Gloria. Mrs. Martinez. Hello, Mr. Finley. Awfully quiet here, isn't it? Sales usually pick up late afternoon. Mm. It's 5:30. He means closer to 6. Most people like to come late. Thrilling for them to see if they can get here before we close. Ha-ha. Let me walk you out, Mr. Finley, so you don't get lost. I have no intention of getting lost. You remind me of a literary figure. Really? Who? Scrooge. Excuse me? As a Finley's store employee, I was disappointed to learn you canceled the Christmas party. The reason I took this job. Canceled 20 years ago. But they still talk about it. Apparently, it's off the hook. What? It's an expression they use today. Jake is trying to reinstate it. He mentioned it. Jake should worry about sales, not parties. Sales are great. We're gonna sell out the toy store. Really? You sound very confident. I am. I'll tell you what, you sell out the toy department, and I will throw a huge party. Wonderful, I will plan the whole thing. Yeah, well, I wouldn't get started just yet. What are these Christmas cards doing here? I threw them away, then they were in my briefcase, and now in my pocket. It's easy to get confused at our age. I hear ginkgo biloba boosts memory. Nothing wrong with my memory. Well, read the cards, because people miss you and they care about you. This is absurd. What...? So I used my degree in design marketing to get a job with Lindy Lowe. I'd really like my own dress line one day. Well, then you will. I will? Mm-hm. Positive thinking, it's my new thing. You just think about something you want and then you get it. Sounds simple. How's that working out for you? I don't know yet. I just came up with it, so... I should go check on Gabe. How long has he been with you? Two months. My brother got called up in October. He didn't have to go because he's a single dad, but he's the kind of guy who does the right thing. He's that guy, huh? Yeah. Yeah, he's always done the right thing. He was a great big brother. When Gabe's mom died, he went through a rough time, but managed to pull himself together and... He's just become the best dad to Gabe. They're lucky to have you to step in. He's a great kid. I'll be right back. Gabe was excited after getting an e-mail from his father, so it took him a while to get settled, but he's asleep now. Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. So after church service, my brother and I would sneak downstairs when our parents were asleep. And we would open our presents. No, you did not. Uh-huh. And then we would rewrap them and open them again the next morning. And you'd pretend to be surprised? Yeah, I actually got pretty good at it. Tell me about Christmas with your family. My mother died Christmas Eve 20 years ago. Freak accident. Snowstorm. Two cabs collided. It... My father and I, we haven't celebrated Christmas since. I'm so sorry. You know, since then, he's really just shut himself off from everything and everyone. Every Christmas Eve, we get on a plane to the Virgin Islands and don't come back until after New Year's. It's been the same thing for 20 years. He calls it a vacation. It's really just an escape. I have no idea why I just told you that. I never tell anyone that. Well, it's good to say things out loud. Helps put them in perspective. How did you get so smart? Let's see what our future holds. All right. That one. Okay. You first. All right. "Your efforts will be rewarded. " That's what Mrs. Merkle told me the other day. Okay, what does yours say? Secret. Ahem. What? It's a secret. I can't tell you or it might not come true, and... Okay, fine. Maybe if I whisper it. Okay. Can we go shopping tonight? I wanna get something to send my dad. By the time we get home and you finish your homework, it's gonna be pretty late. But it's almost Christmas. I have my own money from my allowance saved up. What about tomorrow night? We'll see. "We'll see" usually means no with my dad. Really? I'm starting to sound like a real parent. We'll go shopping before Christmas. Thursday, okay? Promise? I promise. Oh, and by the way, I heard on the radio that Toy Central is getting a shipment of Intellytrons. Really? Hmm. Thanks for letting me know. Bye. Have a good day. Okay, great. Do you want me to wrap it for you? No, it's for me. Oh, excuse me, but could you help me find a dress? I wanna go to a Christmas party. Oh, I don't work here. I'm just looking. Well, you look so familiar. I'm Lindy Lowe. The designer? Oh, wow. Oh, I am so honored to meet you. Oh. Wow, what a rock. Ha-ha. See, my problem is I work all day, and I wanna go to the Christmas party, so I need a dress that goes from day to night. Oh. Apparently, my dresses are sold here, but I'm not sure they'll be in your, uh... Well, your dimensions. Oh, that's a shame, because my friends and I would... Well, we'd look great in your styles. I mean, they're flattering on any figure. Really? Oh, yes. You know what you should do, you should look around. Most women don't look like you or the fashion models on the cover of those magazines. No. No, see we're more the... The... You know, the lovable variety. Bye-bye, now. Oh, bye. Oh. Well, I just called Toy Central. They got a shipment of 20 Intellytrons today. That's great. Oh. They sold out in six minutes. Holly, stand up. What size do you wear? Hmm. A six. Carol, stand up. Oh, you are considerably larger than Holly. What size do you wear? A 10, I guess. Okay, a 12. All the women in the office, stand. Huh. Call the factory. I have a wonderful idea. I want Lindy Lowe dresses to be made in sizes zero through 16. What a fabulous idea you just had. Yes. I'm taking a huge risk, but sales have been horrible this season. I don't know if large women care what they look like but if they do, let's exploit them. Hmm? Oh, and, Holly, call the Home Shopping Channel. I want to go by on Thursday to film a new spot. I will. And on a whim, I'm throwing in your little black dress. Really? Yes. This is either the smartest decision I've made, or the stupidest decision you've ever made. Your job is on the line, Holly. These are your ideas. That's fantastic news. Your first step as a dress designer. I'm gonna call the show, and I'm gonna order three of those little reversible black dresses. That's very generous of you, Jake. You know, you actually are my target consumer. Advocates are saying the Intellytron, this season's hottest-selling toy, heats up and explodes if you play with it for more than an hour. Can you hold on? Only a week to go until Christmas, people are headed to stores to return the Intellytron robot. Jane Binkow for more. Listening? Yeah, I'm listening. I'm out in front of Toys-A-Plenty as angry customers line up for refunds. Turns out I was right not to stock the Intellytron. Looks like we both have something to celebrate. As you can see, there will be trouble ahead for retailers selling the Intellytron robot. A special bottle for a special occasion. Shh. We don't wanna wake up Gabe. To black dresses and exploding robots. Perfect. All right, here we go, and... Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. I own that, and I have, like, three hotels on my property, so you owe me, like, a billion dollars. I'm sorry. Okay, you are seriously good at this game. You are both ruthless and power hungry. And you now have all my money. Well, I'm gonna take that as a compliment. It's because I have the lucky thimble. The what? This is, like, the Monopoly power piece. Whoever has this thimble wins the game. Mm-hm. Ha-ha-ha. I'm actually gonna call my company Thimble Designs. I like that. Me too. You know, you and I should go on a real date. Fancy clothes, fancy dinner, the whole thing. What do you say? Well, Gabe does have a friend who offered to have him over for the night. All right, well, what do you say, this Thursday? I'll send the car around. Okay. Thursday. Three, two, one and action. It's less than a week until Christmas. The rest of this week, you can order one of these gorgeous dresses, designed exclusively for our Home Shopping customers. They are now available in size zero to 16. A new highlight is a little black dress that is reversible. And goes from day to night in a flash. This is like owning two dresses in one. So you have until 5:00. Pick up the phone and call now to get your very own Lindy Lowe. It's called the Every Woman design because every woman should have one of my dresses in their closet. Just in case you do get invited somewhere. Oh, thank you so much for waiting. I'm so sorry. Gabe, I was at the studio with my boss. No big deal. It is a big deal. I promise it's never gonna happen again. It's Thursday. We were supposed to go shopping tonight. Oh. It's not gonna work tonight, it's late... You promised. I know I promised, but sometimes, adults make promises that they can't keep. Even if they really wanna keep that promise, sometimes life just gets in the way. That's not fair. I know it's not fair, and I'm really sorry. My dad never breaks his promises. I wish he were here. Me too. Hello? Miss Wilson, your car is waiting for you. It's Thursday. Just a minute. No, no, it's fine. I completely understand. No, I still have time to cancel. We'll just do it another night. Okay, bye. You look horrible. It hasn't been a very good day. I didn't sleep very well last night. I'm pretty sure Gabe hates me. And I forgot about this date I had with this great guy. Not to mention I'm sure I'm gonna be fired today. Really? None of my ideas worked. She has every right to fire me. Well, she wouldn't fire you for that. She fired the girl in the showroom for wearing too much orange. Oh. This is Holly. What do you mean he's not there? Where is he? I'll be right there. Attention. I have an announcement. What? It's Gabe. He's not at school. I dropped him off, but he left. What do I do? Call the police. Excuse me. They did. I gotta get to the school. Or go home, see if he's there? I have to find him. But I am about to make an announcement. Gonna have to make it without me. I can't. It's about you. Okay, I get it. Sales are lousy, it's all my fault, and I'm fired. Right? Never mind. I quit. He's only 10 years old. No, he's never done this before. He's a responsible kid. Can you hold? I have another call. Gabe, is that you? Mrs. Merkle from Finley's? Gabe's there? What is he doing there? Never mind. Have him wait, and don't let him out of your sight. I'm on my way. Finley's Department Store, please? Gabe. I thought it was best to call you so you wouldn't worry. Thank you. I can't believe you did this. You took the train here all by yourself? You could have been killed or kidnapped. Don't you read the newspaper? No. Well, you shouldn't. It's terrible. Why did you do this? I had to. Three more days till Christmas, no more time. That is not a good enough excuse. Your father trusts me to take care of you. You're my responsibility. You scared me to death. I'm sorry. Well, you're still in trouble. Let's go. Get your stuff. There's gonna be consequences. I'm in charge of you, so it's my responsibility to punish you and... You're grounded. Hey, hey, everything's okay. He's safe now. Everything's okay. He came here to buy... I was afraid I'd lost him. Sometimes kids do silly things. It's not a big deal. This is a huge deal. He could have been kidnapped or killed or... Yeah, but he wasn't. He's fine. He did something wrong, he's never gonna do it again, are you? You don't understand, this is my fault. I should've known. I should have taken him shopping myself, and I didn't... Holly, this is not your fault. Yes, it is, but it's never gonna happen again. I just got fired. You lost your job? Yes, I'm gonna get another job that's gonna give me time to focus on Gabe. He needs me, so from here on in, I am gonna be the best aunt in the world. Why don't I come over and we talk about this? No. Please don't. L... I told you when I met you that I don't have time for dating. I just think you might be overreacting. You don't understand. I took this on. I promised my brother that I would take care of his son. He's on the other side of the world and depending on me. Come on. Dear Mike, I miss you. It turns out I'm a poor substitute for you. I never knew being a parent was so hard. And love isn't enough. You have to listen and really hear what your kids are telling you. You have to watch and really see them for who they are. It's not just about feeding them and getting them to school on time. I wasn't listening or seeing well enough, and Gabe almost got hurt. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Merry Christmas, big brother. Don't worry about anything at home. Gabe and I are doing great. Be safe. I love you. Holly. Oh, Jake. Yes? Your father wants me to give you your plane ticket. And when will that delivery be? Great. Okay. I gotta go. Okay, thanks. What is it? Mom died 20 years ago. She wouldn't have wanted us to stop celebrating Christmas. It was her favorite holiday. Not open for discussion. We are going on vacation like always. Vacation? We don't go to the Islands to lounge on the beach, snorkel, or to sightsee. You can't bear to be here during Christmas. I will not discuss this. I'm not coming, Dad. I'm not a child. I'm not running away from Mom's memory or Christmas anymore. Fine. Do what you want. Authorities apprehended the Santa impersonator before he committed another robbery. And in other news, tomorrow is Christmas Eve and still no snow. Looks like it's not going to be a white Christmas after all. Now to Jane Binkow with an update on the Intellytron disappointment. The legal and financial issues for Intellytron continue to mount tonight. The line outside this toy store wraps right around the block as angry consumers return the faulty robot. We have one of these concerned consumers now. Tell me how you feel about the defective Intellytron. I didn't buy one, personally. See, I work at Finley's Department Store. My boss, Jake Finley, didn't stock the Intellytron. Mrs. Merkle? Mrs. Miracle? Mrs. Merkle? We should turn back to a simpler time, when toys were safe. And playtime was filled with creative wonder and imagination. Finley's Department Store is dedicated to its customers. And tomorrow, in honor of our military, Finley's will give a portion of the proceeds of every toy sold to children whose parents are in the military. So come be a part of the real, true meaning of Christmas and give back. Remember, the happiest people are people who bring happiness to others. That's a Finley's guarantee. Well, that is a wonderful message. Mrs. Merkle. Back to you in the studio. That was Jane Binkow in Manhattan. Here's hoping all you shoppers will be marching on down to Finley's tomorrow to help support this noble cause. When we return... Hello? Holly, you left before I had a chance to tell you my big announcement. A thousand of your little black dresses sold in an hour. A moderate hit. Beginner's luck, of course. My dresses sold out in sizes 10 to 16. You were right. Fat people do care how they look. Okay, so you're not fired. But I would like to talk to you about developing your dress line. I think, with my help, you could be somewhat successful. Really? Yes. There are things I wanna talk to you about. I'm gonna call you back. I'm in the middle of something. Hi. I thought you'd gone to sleep. I wanted you to wake up to a decorated tree. We should have done it days ago. I'm sorry. I know it's not Christmas yet, but I wanna give you this. Dad told me you like to open your presents before Christmas gets here. He told you that? You did this for me? I wanted to surprise you and get you that jewelry box we saw in the window. That's why I went into the city yesterday. Sorry I scared you. I love you so much. I love you too. Good morning, Mr. Finley. Good morning, Mrs. Merkle. I saw you on the news last night. I was standing on the street, minding my own business, and this reporter asked a question, so I answered it. Well, I like your idea about supporting the military. That wasn't my idea. You thought it would be hard for children with parents in the military. And that Christmas would be especially hard for them. I guess you're right. Well, I try to make a habit of it. Toy department didn't sell out. I'll be handing in my resignation today. This is my last Christmas at Finley's. Oh, no. Oh, don't be silly. You are the future of Finley's. I told my father I would quit if we didn't sell out. He's not happy with me, I don't think he'll have a problem accepting. Your father is a stubborn man. Have you spoken to Holly? I don't think that's in the cards. Didn't even get a chance to give her her Christmas present. She'll come around. It's Christmas. It's a magical time. You just have to take a leap of faith. That's strange. They said we weren't gonna get any snow. Well, you know those weathermen. They never get anything right. Wow. It's beautiful. Miracles happen every day. Gloria, what's going on here? I got here very early, they were already lined up. They saw Mrs. Merkle on the news. Thank you for supporting our troops. And reminding us of the real meaning of Christmas. My pleasure, dear. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Dad. Next, please. How are you? Did you authorize a portion of sales go to support children whose parents serve in the military? Uh... Yes, I did. As you recall, I'm still the manager of this store, and in this department, I make the decisions. Good job. Don't stand there, there are customers to ring up. Remember customers? They're the people who buy things. Okay, here we go. Okay. What...? Here we go. Next. Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, the toy that made me become a lawyer. Really? Yeah, personal injury. Thanks for bringing back the meaning of Christmas and supporting the kids. It was my son's idea. Let me ring this up. The Nativity story. That's what my dad would read every Christmas Eve. Really? What a coincidence. "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem saying: 'Where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and are come to worship him. "' Oh, good night. Good night, Mr. Finley. Good night. And thanks for all your hard work. Merry Christmas, you two. Merry Christmas to you. See you boys later. If we don't get... Whew. That was quite a day. Mm. People really responded to your idea of getting back to basic toys. And it didn't hurt that you decided to authorize that donation. You were right about a lot of things. Well, it turns out I'd rather be happy than right. Guess this means I'm not fired? I never really planned on firing you. In fact, I'm thinking it's time I turned the store over to you. I think I'd like to retire, work on my golf game. You've never played golf. That's why I need to work on it. I came here today to bring you something. Come on, I'll show you. What's this? It's a present bought for you a long time ago. It's the train set your mother and I bought for you before the accident. This is the XL Express. This is what I wanted. They don't even make this anymore. This is a collector's item. You've held onto this all these years? Every time I wanted to throw it away, I heard your mother's voice telling me: "Hold onto it. Hold onto it. " I realize now she was telling me to hold onto Christmas. Can I help you? I know you're closing. I just got into town unexpectedly. I need to buy a toy for my son. He wants some robot, but I just heard on the news that they explode. I've been away for a while and I can't go home without something special. How about a train set? It's a perfect toy for a boy. I couldn't take that from you. No, please. Take it. Wow. You saved my night. How much do I owe you? Nothing. It's on Finley's. Customers come first. Really? Thank you. Thank you. Merry Christmas. I won't forget this. Merry Christmas. You have your mother's heart. The man needed a gift. It's Christmas Eve. Come on, Dad. Let's go home. Whew. That's curious. That's Betty and her husband. Where's that music coming from? Don't know. # Laughing all the way # Come on. # Bells on bobtail ring # # They' re making spirits bright # # What fun it is # Merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. # Oh, jingle bells # Thank you. You too. Merry Christmas. Thank you, and you too. This looks like the parties your mother and I used to give. Oh, hi, guys. How about this party, huh? Oh-ho. The bar is open. I told Mrs. Merkle we could throw a party if you sold out. I never thought it would actually happen. Leap of faith. Where did you say she came from? I have no idea. Ha-ha. She came to me and said she was gonna help me save Christmas. Well, I guess she did just that. Wait, don't you have a plane to catch? What about your vacation? I'm not escaping anymore. Merry Christmas, Dad. # In a one-horse open sleigh ## Merry Christmas, son. Excuse me, just a minute. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Mrs. Merkle, thank you for organizing this party. And merry Christmas. Thank you, sir. And merry Christmas to you. Thank you. Feliz Navidad, Gloria. Feliz Navidad, Senor Finley. "And lo, a voice out of the heavens sang: 'This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. "' Who is it? I don't know. Gabe? Daddy? Am I dreaming? No, son, I'm really here. What happened? I got really lucky. My commander drew names for the Christmas lottery, and I won. Here, son, this is for you. I can't believe it's you. All your Christmas wishes seem to have come true. I love when that happens. That doesn't happen every day. And what's that? That you get something back that you cherished, that you thought you lost forever? I'm a lucky guy. And it means more when you have someone you care about that you can share it with, don't you think? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you, dear. Hello? Listen. # Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way # Hear that music? Finley's Christmas party is back. You have to come. But... My brother, he's here with Gabe. Well, bring them. Bring them both. I don't know if I can. Please. I need you here. It wouldn't be a Christmas party without you. # Bells on bobtail ring ## I wanna go skating at Rockefeller Center, haven't done it in years. Hey, you made it. Yeah, I heard there was a party. Hi, Gabe. Hi. Hi. Train set. Finley's guy. This is Jake Finley, and this is my brother, Mike. Of course you are. It's a pleasure. You throw a great Christmas party. Gabe? Oh, come here, sweetie. Excuse us. Hello. I'm Mrs. Miracle. Hey, I'm sorry about the other day. I was worried and upset, and... No, please, don't think anything of it. Here. This is for you. For me? Go ahead, open it. Okay. It's my lucky thimble. This is perfect. You look absolutely beautiful. Thank you. Oh, sweetheart, I'm so glad you've got your Christmas wish. What do you mean? Well, you prayed for your father to be home for Christmas. How do you know about that? Well, I must have overheard you. But I didn't say it out loud. Oh, my goodness, it's so late. I've gotta run. Can't you spend Christmas with us? I would love to, sweetheart, but I have to move on. See, there are other little boys and girls who need me, and you're with your family now. I wish my mom were here. Me too, sweetheart. Your mother is so proud of you. You knew my mother? I know her like you know her, in my heart. Oh, sweetheart. I have to say goodbye. Merry Christmas. Oh. Merry Christmas, Mrs. Miracle. Bye. Thanks. Where did Mrs. Miracle go? She said she had to move on, that other boys and girls needed her. She said that? Of course she did. Merry Christmas, Holly Wilson. Merry Christmas, Jake Finley.
