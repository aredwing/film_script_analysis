If you want a room, come tomorrow. I'm begging you. How much? It's 180,000 pesos. But I can't show you the room at this time. Look, I can pay three months' in advance. It's 180,000. For three... it'll be 540,000 pesos. Utilities are included, but the kitchen and bathroom are shared. And I lock the door at 10:30 p.m. Okay, but please let me in quick. - Don't you have more stuff? - No. Come in. - Good morning. - Good morning. Can I use the bathroom? See if it's free. Thanks. Hey! There's a cockroach in the bathroom. Kill it. Good morning. SALESWOMAN WANTED, 18 TO 25 Good morning. - Hi. Can I help you? - Are you taking resumes? No, we don't need staff at the moment. - It's not because of my age, right? - No. Of course not. But if you'd like to leave me your resume, maybe if something comes up... Oh yes, thanks. I really appreciate it. - Here you go. - Thank you very much. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hey! Oh my God. What happened? Let me get this. Let me see. What happened? You're drunk. Come on. Come on, hold onto me. Get hold of me. Fine, stay there. - No no no. - What? Leave it on. Leave it on. Morning. There's no hot water. Mm, how about that? And so...? So take a cold shower. - Hi Mom. - I'm coming down. What happened? He hit you? Cheated on you? No, Mom. You know, when your dad and I were young, we had a really big argument. It was a rainy night, but I decided to pack my stuff and leave him. But when I went to get on the bus back to Tunja, he stopped me and convinced me not to leave him. The next day we found out that the bus I was going to take had crashed and many people were killed and injured. That day we realized we had to stay together for life... until death do us part. But sleeping in different rooms, no? But under the same roof. Look, Mom, all I ask is that you let me stay here until I find a job. My love, this is your home, but you belong with Mario. Please call him. I'm going to take a shower. - Hi Mom. - Mario is downstairs waiting for you. What are you talking about? Why? Talk to him, okay? Okay. Tell him I'm coming. Well, I'll leave you alone, so you can talk. - How are you? - Fine. And you? Fine. Here. Thanks. They're beautiful. Karen, I have to tell you... I'm a fool. Sometimes I say things that I don't mean. I've come to apologize. I know we are in a crisis. I know that if we both try harder, we can make things better than before. Look, let's go out to dinner... so we can relax and talk. What do you think? Hey, I've been waiting for awhile now. It's not a problem. I can wait for you. I'm waiting for you. Bye. - Mario, how are you? - Sandra, what are you doing here? - I'm meeting a friend, but he's late. - This is my wife. - Hi. I'm Sandra. - Nice to meet you. I'm Karen. Well, why don't you join us while you wait for your friend? - All right. - Okay, come on. House red wine. - Three glasses? - Yes, please. A glass of white for me, please. Sure. Excuse me. Hello. What's up? Okay. No no no, not a problem. Okay. Bye. Thanks. It seems that my friend has a problem and can't make it. Well, looks like you'll have to join us. No, I don't want to impose. It's not a problem, is it, darling? Well, let's order. Well, I know you gave the quote. Full or basic coverage? Full coverage, of course. You know. I included injury, coverage against losses, even coverage for heavy machinery. - And they approved? - What do you think, Mario? Wonderful! Well, then let's toast to that lucrative commission. - Cheers. - Cheers. And what exactly is this business? Well, company stuff-- High-risk insurance, heavy machinery, you know. And by the way, Karen, what do you do? At the moment I'm a housewife. I love reading. I'm reading Ibsen's "A Doll's House" at the moment. - Do you know it? - Yes, of course-- the play. It's the same author who wrote "The Glass Menagerie" right? - No, that was Tennessee Williams. - Ah, of course. Tennessee Williams. You know "A Doll's House," darling, right? I don't know anything about novels. You know, honey... We're talking about plays, Mario. See? I have no idea! Don't forget the appointment on Monday with the clients to see whether they accept the offer. Oh yes, I got the message. At 9:00, right? Yes, at 9.00. Karen. Karen. Mario, I want a divorce. I need to be alone. I need to be my own person. Alone... So tell me one thing, Karen. How will you manage on your own? You cannot do anything. Can you get me my jacket, please? You know what? I have done everything I could. If you want to go, just go. This is the last chance I will give you. I don't want to see you coming back asking for forgiveness. What would you say if I offered you an English course completely free for the first three months? Would you take it? - Well, yeah. Yes. - That's precisely what you have to do-- offer people free English courses. Simple as that. But I don't understand. I offer courses for free? Obviously, people have to buy the materials, like in any other school. It's simple. So when will I start? First, I have to test you. I will give you three forms. If you get at least three clients, you'll be hired immediately. And you pay me for the test, right? Not exactly-- not with money, but you'll be employed by us. Let me give you some advice. I don't do it for anybody. I'm doing it for you because I like you. Why don't you start with your family? Your uncles, your cousins-- they can help you. And then you would be officially hired straight away. Okay. I'm going to try. Thank you very much. Good morning, sir. How are you? I'm here on behalf of American Dream. I'm offering really good English courses... - No. I'm not interested right now. - The first three months are free. Thanks, but not now. Thanks. - I can give you a form. - Not now. I'm busy. Okay. Thanks. But this is a special offer-- the first three months for free. Okay. Thanks. Well, maybe, if you explain it to me. My English is really bad. I completely understand. This is why we are offering these courses. If you let me in, I can explain everything to you. Just tell me when you want to start. But you're sure that we don't have to pay anything up front? Completely sure. Shall we fill in the form? - Okay. - Perfect. - What is the boy's name? - Alejandro. Would you like a form? NO SOLICITING Can I give you a form? Are you interested? No. Okay, thanks. Hi. I broke the key. That's just what I needed. I don't know if I have something to open it. What have you done to it? I'm going to ring the bell. I'm sorry. Magda doesn't open the door at this hour. Give me my handbag. Hey! Where are you going? Let's go. Okay, I've found someone who can help us out. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. Hey, thanks for the other night. Do you want a beer? No thanks. You've already done a lot for me. If I had to pay for it, I wouldn't have asked. Honestly. Barmaid! Two beers, please. - Thanks. - You're welcome. And you really don't know anybody around here? No, I don't know anybody here. That's strange, because you're married, right? Or aren't you? The ring is just an accessory? No. But I don't want to talk about it now. It's funny. I knew that you would be like that. - Like what? - Like that, like you are. Why? What do you mean? Because of your haircut. - And now you are a psychic? - I'm a hair stylist. - You finally call me, eh, blondie? - Hi honey. Karen, this is my boyfriend who I told you about before. Look, I'm going to ask you two favors: first, don't get in too late; second, don't have parties. Hey, but give me some money, please. Okay. How much? Well, I have a guest. Okay, I have to go. What's going on? I thought the guy in the car was your boyfriend. Oh, no. I wish he was my boyfriend. He's married. So who was that guy? That's just an idiot that I use for money now and then. No, we haven't asked for anything else. The guys at the bar bought you them. - No, but we don't want-- - Excuse me, but they've already paid. What's wrong with you? It's free beer. Just put on your best smile. - Karen, Karen. - Listen... - Well, thank you very much. - We can come in for awhile, no? The sun is rising. Come on, just a little while. - We had a good time, didn't we? - No, no. Really. That's enough. - Karen. - I'll have a last sip. Karen. Well, thanks a lot. Really. - Keep in touch. - I'll call you. - See you later. - Bye, Karen. - We had a good time. No complaints. - I'll never be able to get rid of him. Look, honey, lesson one. You never give your real number. Otherwise, you can't shake them off. Come on, that's shameless. Just a little bit. And Horacio? He's at work. So it's not a problem. No, miss. Thank you. I haven't even asked you yet. Please. No, thanks. Not at the moment. Thank you. Thank you. At the moment, no. - Good afternoon. - Hello. The lunch options are Ajiaco, Mondongo, vegetable soup and the main course. I'll have the vegetable soup and the main course, please. Sure. One order of vegetable soup with main dish. Hurry up, girl! - Something wrong, ma'am? - My bag has been stolen. - You're sure it was here? - I'm sure. I arrived, and I hung it here when I sat down. It was a big, black leather bag. I have no money to pay you. What? And so? What do we do? Look, I'll leave you my ring as a guarantee and tomorrow I'll come and pay, okay? - Until tomorrow only. - Yes, sir. I promise. "No money to pay." - Thank you very much. - Eating for free. I know that's the rules, but you told me one thing I know that's the rules, but you told me one thing and now you're saying another. Now I need to sell two more courses? This is a scam. You're misleading people. I'm going to sue. Stay here if you want to be ripped off. Now you'll fly over there. Oh, you broke your back. - Hi! - Hi. - What's your name? - Karen. And yours? - Sergio. - How old are you? - Five. - Guess how old I am. - 16? - Don't bother the lady. - I'm not bothering her! - He isn't bothering me. Don't worry. - Bye, Sergio. - Come on, son. My apologies. - Alejandro, some cigarettes, please. - Sure, Mr. Enrique. I'll give them to you right away. Hello. Excuse me. My bag was stolen and I have no money to take the bus. Can you help me out? - No. I don't have any money. - Thanks. - Look. Take it. - Thank you so much. Really, thanks. Hi, ma'am, excuse me. My bag was stolen. Can you spare me any money for the bus? Can you spare me any money for the bus? Thank you very much. Thanks. Thank you very much. God bless you. - My purse was stolen. - I have no money. - You need money? - Yes. - My pleasure. - Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. No, honey, that's all I've got. I've only got enough for the bus. I'm sorry. They've stolen my wallet. Can you give me money for the bus? I need 100 pesos more to pay for the bus. Thank you. Thank you very much. Can you spare some change? Or a bite? Don't bother the customers. Go away! Karen. Are you there? It's open. I was asleep. Alberto chose to stay with his wife tonight. Today is my birthday and I don't want to spend it bored and alone. And Horacio? Working. - Do you have plans for tonight? - No. I'm going to stay here. You want to join me? Look, I'm all dressed up. I was supposed to have a date with Alberto, but he stood me up... on my birthday. Change your face! - I don't like all this, Patricia! - What? I don't like it. I don't like this music. I don't like the crowds. Here. Come on, come on, come on. Drink it all-- all of it. All of it, all of it. Okay, but with you-- a toast to your birthday. Okay, sounds good. Cheers! To my birthday! To you! - Drink drink drink. - No, I don't want it. Karen! It's for my birthday! It's a gift. - Come on, move. - I don't know how to dance to this. You're gonna fall asleep on me. No, sir. Have another drink. I like to see you like this! Bottoms up. Feel better? I feel ugly... and old. You're not ugly or old. You are a very pretty woman. I think what you need is a guy who loves you as you deserve. No, Patricia, I don't need that. Of course you do. One nail drives out another. I speak from experience. I was also in love. The only man I ever loved in my life, I think. And when it was over, I thought I was going to die. But before long I met another guy and I moved on. And what about Horacio and Alberto? That's different. It's not love. I'm not going to give anyone else my heart for them to fuck with it. Have you never done it just for pleasure? I've only ever slept with my husband. And you loved him? Listen. You have to take all these things that you're feeling now and use them to your own advantage. You are a very pretty and smart woman. Don't be afraid of living life and taking risks... like I do. Well, see you tomorrow. I'm going to sleep now. See you tomorrow. Hello. My bag was stolen. Can you spare me some money for the bus? Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Hello. My bag was stolen. Can you spare me some money for the bus? I don't have anything-- just my own change. I'm so glad to see you, honey. Alberto has asked us to go out tonight. What do you mean he asked "us" to go out tonight? Well, I think it's a good idea. No, Patricia, I can't, really. You have nothing to do tonight, so don't tell me you can't. Karen, just for a bit. How exactly do you think I can go out when I can't even afford to eat breakfast? Come on, I'm going to get you something nice to eat and then after that we can look for jobs. Okay. You go and I'll catch up with you later. Okay, but don't be too long. Well, honey, it's better than nothing. It's not the best job in the world, but at least you can make some money. I'll look out for something better and let you know. - Thanks. - I have to go to work now. I'm late. - Okay, thanks. - Good luck. - Thanks. Goodbye. - You're welcome. Bye. Karen? Karen! - Hi. - Hi! - How are you? - Nice to see you. - How are you? - Fine fine. And you? - What are you doing here? - I've just come from the office. - And you? How's life? - Fine. I'm just walking about. - It's so nice around here. - Yeah, it's nice. - You got married, right? - Yes, I got married. I did. - And you? How's life treating you? - Fine fine. I have two girls, I'm married. Actually, I'm in a bit of a rush right now. Give me your mobile number and I'll call you. Mafe, you know what? I lost my phone - and haven't got a new one yet. - Your home number, then. Actually, I just moved. I haven't got a landline yet. Give me your card and I'll call you. Yes, yes, sure. Let me give you my card. Let me give you my business card. Listen, the extension number, my office number and the last one is my mobile. - Perfect. I'll call you. - Call me. - Sure. Nice to see you. - Same. - Bye, Karen. - Bye. Truth is, Eduardo and I met in college when he was studying engineering. But you never finished the course. Why? I studied engineering because my dad wanted another engineer in the family. But after a year I realized that it wasn't what I wanted to do. No no no. Sorry to interrupt Eduardo, but that's not true. Ladies, what really happened is that Eduardo is a bohemian, an avid writer. He prefers being in front of a computer or a typewriter, occupied with things that only he understands. Is this not true? Yes, I like writing. I decided to dedicate myself to literature, but it's not a big deal. Honestly, you should dedicate yourself to something else. Reading is so boring. People don't like it. Okay, so what do you like doing then? I don't know, but something active and exciting. But imagine yourself just sitting there turning pages. What a drag! I agree. I love extreme sports. In fact, I've recently started skydiving. You know what? One of these days we should all go together. - What do you think? - No. - Karen? Let's go! - No, thanks. - So how did it go with the flyers? - Fine. And what did you think of the guy that Alberto brought for you? - All right. - Do you like him or not? Charming, that's all. I thought he was pretty boring. Did you see his old-school haircut? He looks like a granddad. No, darling. Patricia, that's not important. Don't be silly. And what about Alberto, eh? Gorgeous, no? - He invited us to his apartment. - No, I'm not going. - What about his wife? - Why not? That cow is away somewhere. I don't know, I don't care. No, Patricia, I'm not going. Seriously. Yes, you are. Come on. I promise next time I'll tell Alberto to bring you someone decent. Because that guy, no. There will be no "next time." Finally! Hold this. We must come back, no? - I'll pay by card, okay? - Yes, sir. - And can you clear the table? Thanks. - Okay. - Can I take this to go, please? - Sure. For a homeless kid who lives near us. Congratulations on the beautiful apartment, Alberto. - Make yourself at home. - Gorgeous. I love the fireplace. Really? And you haven't even seen the bedroom yet. - You want to see it? - Show me. - Okay. Make yourselves at home, guys. - Have fun. - Thanks. - Patricia, don't be too long. - Which way? - Right there. - Alberto, don't be too long. - Okay. Do you want to hear music? Let me see what's around here. Let me see. Nothing. There's nothing good to listen to. Well, I'm not so sure about that. - Are we going to the terrace? - Fine, it's okay. What are you writing at the moment? - I've just finished a play. - Really? - Yes. - When I was at school, I loved acting. We performed "La Celestina" and I played Melibea. - Really? And are you still acting? - No. And even if I did it again, I'd have to be Celestina. Look at me. Please, don't exaggerate. But you would like to act again? I'd love to. Really. Okay. And what are you doing now? Do you really want to know? If you don't mind. I am... painting my life... - repainting it. - Nice. Really. Yes. It's difficult, but I'm getting there. - Hey, what's up? - Hi. - What's up, blondie? - Everything's okay. - Okay. - This is my friend. - You'll look out for her, right? - Of course. Obviously, blondie! I've seen you before at the bus stops. Here's a present for you. Thanks. Where've you been? - Why are you getting home so late? - What are you doing here? What do you mean? I've been waiting for you. Where've you been? With Karen, can't you see? Who were you with? Why didn't you pick up your phone? I didn't pick up because I couldn't. Really? Why couldn't you? Who were you with? Horacio, let's talk tomorrow, okay? Let's talk tomorrow? Why can't we talk now? It's already "tomorrow." Have you seen the time? Exactly. We're really tired, so let's talk tomorrow. Why won't you tell me who you were with, blondie? Hey! Why won't you tell me who you were with? I was with five guys! Why do you treat me like this? Let's talk tomorrow, okay? Talk about what? You're right. I've had it with you. Fuck off. Don't follow me or call me. Fuck off! - Come on, baby, don't be like that. - Don't "baby" me. Fuck off. Let's talk, okay? Come on, I've been waiting for you for five hours. I don't care how long you've been waiting. Can't you see I want to go to sleep? Fuck off. Aren't you embarrassed in front of Karen? Get lost, Horacio. You know what I'm capable of. Don't make me think any worse of you. Just go away and do whatever you want. You're not scaring me with this nonsense. Get lost. Idiot. Fuck off, Horacio! You'll see. Please come with me, ma'am. We have to search you. In your underwear, please. How are we going to resolve this? Because you have to pay me three times the cost of the things you stole. Sir, I have no money. It's simple. Call a relative, a friend, somebody to bring you the money. I don't know anybody around here. Okay, then I have no option but to call the police. No, please. I'm begging you, sir. What did you steal? Deodorant and some sanitary towels. You know what? Just go. Just go, but don't ever come to this supermarket again, you hear me? Hello. Are you leaving? Where are you going? Very nice, very nice. - That puppet was awesome. - Yeah, really good. But I think he was flirting with you. Well, I have a certain charm. Don't you think? Without a doubt. So I'll see you again, won't I? - Yes, of course. - Okay. Do you know the East Tower? Well, my office is on the roof. I'm there Monday through Friday in the afternoon. You can come whenever you want without an appointment. - I'll surprise you. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. Excuse me, ma'am. What's wrong? Oh, sir, somebody stole my bag and left me with nothing. - But are you okay? Did they harm you? - No, I'm fine. Be patient. Anyway, you can get the material things back. I can help you out, if you like. I'd really appreciate it if you could, because I need to get home. Thank you, sir. Goodbye. Thanks. Done. - Thank you. - Okay. - Have you chosen, honey? - Yes. I like this. What? It's okay, I like it. Come on. You'll look gorgeous. I hope so. Move your hair, please. And how is Alberto? He asked me to move in with him. Can I tell you something? - I feel really sorry for his wife. - No. Why sorry? That woman is horrible to him. - Ready? - Do it. You know what? I've never been to Monserrate. Really? Would you like to come with me? No. Why? You don't know the story? What do you mean? What? They say that couples who go to Monserrate will never get married. Well, I think I'm going to close the office for today. I want to take you somewhere. Bring me the bill, please. Thanks. But this one's on me. No. Yes. A long time ago we looked like shadows. I know, darling. I know. Where is it? I don't know, darling. I don't know. I gave it to you to look after on the first day, - the same day that I accepted you. - I know, darling. I know. Then where the hell have you put it?! If it weren't for this, we would be free. - I don't know, darling. - Shut up! Don't call me that! I haven't been your darling for a long time now. And yet, I can't get away from here. I need to find her. If you tell me, I swear to you I'll forget all the bad memories. But if we don't find her, the bad ones will destroy the good ones... and then I'm going to hate you for the rest of my life. If I could take somebody's hand... If I could ask somebody where she is. Help me! Do you know where she is? But how could you know? You don't even exist. You are the same as me-- the same. I have only you. So how did you like it? I loved it. Congratulations. You're brilliant. - Thank you very much. - Well done, Pedro. Congratulations. Congratulations. Buddy, this is your play, your baby, and finally it's seen the light of day! - Congratulations, buddy. - Thank you. - Hang on. Eduardo, you wrote this play? - Yes. He didn't tell you? This man is the creator of the masterpiece you have just seen. - But you brought it to life. - A minor role. Everyone, here is our star writer! - Hello. - Hi everyone. - Hi Eduardo. How are you? - Fine. You were really good, Lorena. - Congratulations to you too. - Thank you. - Oh, this is Karen. - Hi Karen. How are you? - How are you? Nice to meet you. - Did you like the play? - Very good. Congratulations. - Thank you very much for coming. Are you staying here for awhile this evening? Yes, of course. Honestly, I can't. I have to work tomorrow. No, don't say that. Your boyfriend is a genius. Pedro's direction was really good. You were great as well; and the guys, excellent. Thank you so much. - Excuse me one moment. Persuade her. - Of course. Karen, you can't go. We have to celebrate. You don't have a choice! Well, here we are. Goodbye. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Bye. Do you want to come in? - Welcome to my home. - Thanks. What are you thinking about? About the great time I had with you tonight. Thanks for coming with me, really-- - honestly. - I had a really good time as well. Hold on. What's going on? Let's do it with it on. No. Take it off. Wait. What's the problem? They're so small. What are you talking about? You look great to me. - Really? - Really. Patricia. Patricia! Mrs. Magda! Hello. What happened, huh? I'm ashamed that you've seen me like this. Don't be silly. You've seen me worse. Was it because of Alberto? Look at me. Remember that you are a really beautiful person, full of life. You're-- you're a wonderful person... and you'll get over it, right? That's not true. What do you mean? I'm not even blonde. I'm a fake. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. - Hello. - Hi Mom. Say hello to your mommy. - Go to say hello to your mommy! - Mom, don't force her. I'll see you in a little while, okay? - Nice to meet you. - Goodbye. I don't know how to run so slowly. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Bye. - Bye. Let's go son. Sir! Your wallet! Ah, my wallet! Come on, run! Run and get it from her. Come on, son. Hello. - You're so kind. Have a nice day. - Goodbye. And the little duck has arrived. Little missy? Very good. One, two, three. Very good. Come for the little duck. - Kisses for the duck! - Very good. I'm going to put this one here. The other is for your mom. Come here, Patricia. For your mom. We put this one here, you see? Patricia, why didn't you tell me? Because it's not easy. That'll be my mom. I'll get the door. Where? - I'm coming. - Grandma is here. - So you live here. - What do you want? - To talk to you. - About what? I need to talk. I promise to leave after that. Please. Let's go. - At your service. What would you like? - Two cappuccinos, please. We don't have cappuccino. Just black coffee or latte. - Okay, two lattes. - Sure. - I'll have a beer, instead of a latte. - Sure. Karen, I know that I made a lot of mistakes... that I wasn't a good husband, - that... - Don't apologize, please. Our marriage was a mistake. I was never the woman for you. - Thanks. - Thanks. You look good with short hair. - And how's business? - Fine fine. I finished the thing I was working on with Sandra and, well, now we're waiting for other projects. And are you working? I'm doing this and that around here. And your ring? You're not wearing it. Do you want to know the truth? Are you seeing someone? Listen... I had to pawn the ring because I had no money to pay for a meal. - Why didn't you tell me? - And... our relationship was over before I left, wasn't it? Shall we get the bill? Ma'am. The bill. - How much is it? - 3,000 pesos. Let me get it. - My pleasure, please come again. - Thank you. Well, when will I see you again? I don't know Mario. I'll call you sometime, okay? - Okay. - Goodbye. - Hi. - Hi. - Someone called for you. - Who? They called from the bookstore where you left your resume, to offer you a job. They want you to get over there as soon as possible. Thanks. Bye. I'll see you later. Okay, good luck. Hello. You know I hate it when people turn up late. Yes yes. I'm sorry. But I had to do some things at the last minute and I couldn't call you. But let's not argue about it. Yes, you're right. I have good news. Me too! No. You tell me first. I got a job in a bookstore. That's good. I'm so happy. It's like everything is beginning to fall into place. I'm so happy for you. And what's your news? I've been hired to go write in Argentina. - Because you sent them the play? - Yes. - Wow, I'm impressed! - Thank you. But there's a second part-- I want you to come with me. Look, it's perfect. It's the chance we've been waiting for, an opportunity to be together, away from everything. You're right. Let's go? Let's go. - I like you better with long hair. - Come on, Mom! Mario misses you a lot. I'm here to say goodbye. - Where are you going? - To Argentina. And Mario? My relationship with Mario was over a long time ago, Mom. You have to understand. I knew it. He's absolutely right. You're going crazy. Think, please! You will never understand me, right? You know what, Mom? I love you. But I'm leaving. And I'll be fine. Really. Give me a hug. You know what? I'm feeling bad about leaving the bookstore. Don't worry about that. With my income in Argentina we have enough for both of us. Can you pass me my jacket, please? I can't. KAREN CRIES ON THE BUS
