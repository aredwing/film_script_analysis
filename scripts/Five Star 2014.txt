I was locked the fuck up. Remember getting that call. Putting the call in, I should say. Had a beautiful baby boy, and I wasn't there to greet him when he came into the world, and, um... It's funny. I was released the week after. April 1. My pop's birthday. Came home on April Fool's Day. Dig that. I remember walking in, opening the P's. Everybody... "Yo, Primo, Primo. Shit." Fuck y'all. I want to go see my son. Walked up the stairs. I was nervous. Haven't seen my daughter in so long. Open the door. Everybody greeting me. "Welcome home. Welcome home." "Yeah, it's nice. That-That was sweet. Move. I want to see my son." And I walked into the room. There's a little baby, about this big. Just laying on the bed. Wrapped up, blankets, sky blue hat on. And, um... "That's my son." All I kept saying was, "That's my son." I remember my daughter ran in the room and... "Daddy, Sincere." "Sincere, Daddy." I said, "Yes, baby." I picked my son up. I've never... I can't recall tearing so hard in my life, even when my daughter was born. But I teared like a baby... because I missed the most important part of my son's life, and that was his coming. And on that day, I promised my kid... I swore to him. I swore to my son and I swore to my daughter. "I'll never leave you again." What's good, boy? Yo. What's good, bro? What up, yo? Yeah. What's good, man? Yo, what's up? What's good, little man? You got a nicer ball. You got a nicer ball. Holy shit. Well, well, well. What's good, man? What's up, man? No pounds? I gotta go, man. Hold on, bro. Why you moving so fast, man? I gotta go, man. I gotta go. Just chill out, bro. What's good with you? Take it easy, man. What's good, man? Why you so nervous, man? Yo. Relax, bro. Just a few words, man. When you gonna start moving it for me, man? I don't want to do nothing for you, man. I'm good. I'm good, man. Watch your tone, bitch. This nigga's a big shot. What you mean you good, man? Shit, man. This nigga's a big shot now. What's up, man? Filling up your pockets? You good? You eating? Yo, John! If it ain't the moneymaking RayLo. Big Primo. RayLo. What's good, boy? Ain't nothing, man. Macking. What you doing with my young 'un? Just saw him passing through, chop it up with him. - You good? - I'm chilling. Just about to spin off, man. It's hot as a bitch out here. RayLo, make sure the numbers right. I'm-a holla at you. A'ight. Where you been, man? I ain't seen you since the funeral. Chilling, bro. You gotta come out more often, man. Staying in the house. Shit ain't as depressing as it looks. Yeah, I'm stuck in the crib, man. Well, come back out. There's a lot more on the streets. I'm sorry about your old man, though. Yo, I appreciate that, man. No problem, man. Yeah, man. Sorry about your old man. - Y'all knew my pops? - Yeah, yo. He was a good dude. Mel was the best, you know what I mean? Everybody knew your pops. Respect. Remember that. But I got you here now, so... Got some kicks on. Let's see how your ball game looking. Bet it's better than yours. - Check. - You know it. - Don't lose your breath. - 1-zip. Check up, bitch. Why you fouling for? Don't start crying. Why you fouling for? Stop crying. Why you fouling? Stop crying. - My point. - Your push. My point. Now you playing like a little man. You're just a hacker, yo. Come on, man. Let's play ball. Put your fucking hands up. Let's play ball. It's my ball. Catch up. Game over! Let's go! 'Bout time. How's your moms, man? She's good. How's she hanging in there? She's living. You know. We gonna make sure she lives great. You gonna make sure of that. You gonna make sure and be the man. Of course, man. The man of the house. All this nonsense out here in the streets, J. It ain't for you. Real money. What you got in mind? Got a lot of things in mind, but I know what I want you to do. I mean, like... I owe it to your pops, man. Yo, come on, man. Don't play me like no little kid, man. Relax. Nobody playing you like a kid, John. Your pops took me in at the same age you is, showed me everything I need to know. Understand? Respected by everybody. Bloods, Crips, Kings, etas, everybody. And he was a neutral dude. You know why? 'Cause he gave respect. He had power, but he never abused it. Understand? Yeah. He took me in, five hard. Didn't discriminate against me or nothing. Taught me everything I need to know. I mean, this works out for you and you comfy, which I'm sure you will be, bring it to the home team, know what I mean? Get the one-eyed willy and do one of these a little bit. All right? You offering me to be Blood, man? It's a offer, but... Don't think you gotta do what the rest of these dudes gotta do. Me, I take care of that. You ain't gotta go buck 50 no grills. Steal no cars or some shit. Know what I mean? I'll bless you in. I'm a five star. They don't question me. Say the word right now, I'll put it in the books. When you walk outside tomorrow morning, or even in the next hour, all the fuckers is gonna salute you. What's a five star? Never thought I had to explain it to you, know what I mean? Always thought Mel would be here to tell you. Five lanes, baby. First five to ever start this whole Blood Piru game. I mean... It goes deeper than what you see on the TV. Right now, what you read... got Bloods and Crips fighting over this. Five stars, we don't gotta fight over that. Understand? We generals. We salute everything. We done bossed up. Everybody answers to me. Shit don't go down unless it goes through me. Before it was me, it was me and your pops. I love him to death, but what he taught me, I'm gonna use. I'm-a do for you what was done for me. Put you under the wing. You ain't gotta worry about nothing. Know what I mean? You ready to come home? You really think that was a stray bullet? I mean, you gotta remember, son. The streets are talking. The streets are evil. You feel me? Like... People are negative. People were envious of the respect he had, 'cause he had it. You feel me? Like, niggas would be, like... "Yo, why he got all that for?" What about me? What I got?" Hold on one sec. Hello? What's good? What? You can't handle that? So you want me to come all the way over there? All right. I'll be there in 15 minutes, man. Fifteen minutes, man. Look, man, I make a rule real quick. Swing by the crib, we'll chop it up. I mean talk a little more. All right. Look like you're having a party right now. We just sitting, chilling, man. You got a problem. What's the problem? I'm here. I know you're here. - Damn. - Want my money. That's what's up, like... Like I said, give me two days, and you'll have your money. Two more days. You sent your little army, squad down here, whatever you wanna call 'em. Know what I'm saying? I sent 'em back empty-handed, as you can see. Look at it. It's a little rough down here, man. I mean, it's hard right now, man. That's not my problem! Getting the package to you, that's my problem. I get two days? Two extra days? That's all I ask for, man. Been running with you for two years, bro. Know what I'm saying? You got it. Two days. That was rude of me. Good looking, man. Look out. Know what I'm saying? It's just business. That's cool. Just business. It was just business. It's just fucking business. It's just business, right? Here. Let me do that for you. But you... You know that you... Just being in the kitchen alone is a privilege right now. If you showed me how to do what you do, we could be doing it together. Ew. That's why your corn be tasting so sweet. What? Mind your business and stay out of my damn kitchen. Maybe I need to stand in the kitchen with you more often. You hear my secrets. If I find out anybody's cooking like me, I'll know where they got it from. From you. I'm not telling nobody about that. I don't put sugar in corn. Time to eat, guys. Come on. Let's go. Come on, E'niyah. Eli? Eli? It's time to eat. Come eat. Come eat. I'm hungry. - I found it. - Go put it in the garbage. Eat. Growing up, I used to always want to be a prima ballerina. I see myself being somebody important... and hopefully making a difference in someone's life. Making a difference in whose life? I don't know. So what do you want to be? You'll be, like, a teacher? No! I mean, maybe. I don't know. Maybe? I don't know. I don't think kids will like me that much. Go on. Where do you see yourself? I don't know. Sit down. You ever been to the zoo before? That's so random, but, no. It's just a question. I haven't. Why not? I don't know. Because... Not even, like, a school trip or nothing? Nothing. I mean, of course I had chances, I guess. I just never went. Why? You were scared? No. Tell me what's up. Why not? Isn't it kind of, like, a kid thing though? Don't little kids go to... Hell, no. You ever seen a grizzly bear? No. Them shits is, like, seven feet tall, 300 pounds. Like crazy vicious, but at the same time they're like little kittens. Mad playful and just... They're cool. You gotta see it. I would like that. So you saying I could take you? Are you asking me? Kind of. I think we could work something out. Right on time. What's up, man? What up, boy? What's good, yo? Chillin', man. What up? What you been up to? Macking, man. Why you got this whole block smelling like sh... You crazy, man. I'm-a holla at you, boy. Where you at? Girlfriend right here, you know. Okay. Hubby life. I feel ya, I feel ya. Yo. What up? What's good? You got that? Yeah. We good to go. All right. I took care of it. I got you, man. What's good, yo? You got the goons out here, yo. Good luck, son. I'm-a holla at ya. How's the food? It's good. Even though I hate vegetables or whatever this green stuff is. So you saw Jasmin today? How was that? Yeah. Yeah? What, Mom? Did I teach you how to speak... so you can answer my question with one word? She's nice, Ma. She's nice. I'm not gonna be home tomorrow night. Where you going? I-I gotta go out. Out where? You got a date? Crap. And me find out. I'm gonna go play bingo. Bingo! In Titi's house? It's Friday. You told me to get out of the house and do something, so I'm going to play bingo in Titi's house. Tell Titi I say hi. She was asking about you, so why don't you go say hi yourself. I don't wanna go over there. She annoys me. And she got those couches with the freaking... with the plastic on it. It be sticking to my skin. I hate... I hate her house. Are you giving me that look, like... You know exactly what I'm talking about. You know she put that plastic there so you can protect the furniture. Yeah. She protecting the furniture for the past, like, 40 years. But she got it for 40 years 'cause she put that plastic... She gonna protect it for another 40 years, right? Tell her to take that shit off. Now you're getting too, like, plastic in the furniture and shit. Come on, Ma. So... Do you know, um, about... About what? Safe sex? Come on, Ma. Don't start talking about this stuff. So who is supposed to talk to you about this stuff? I know about this stuff. What do you know about? I took sex ed. Okay. What did it teach you? First of all, I learned how to put a condom on. You know? Back in my days, you didn't have to wear condoms, because... Come on, Ma. You'd be with just one person. And you don't be running around with Tom, Dick and Harry. You just stay with one man, and you didn't have to worry about condoms or no condoms. There's nothing wrong with more than one girl. What? I did not raise you to be a player. I raised you better than that. Come on, Ma. I told you about respecting... I told you about respecting a woman. I do respect women. If Jasmin comes here crying, you're gonna get it. Ma, she's not gonna come here crying. If Jasmin comes over here... complaining about you and telling me that you broke her heart, you're gonna deal with me, boy. I love you, Mother. Yeah, I love you too. The A/C is on. So why's it not working? Call the landlord. So, what, he can come get punched in the face? Why you gonna punch him in his face? Because he's fucking annoying with all this bullshit. Fucking yesterday he texted me... "f you have a problem with paying the rent..." and you have a problem with being there, "I'll refund you your security deposit." Complaining... You ain't fixed the fucking closet doors for six months. How long we waited for the closet doors, the bathroom, the sink was fucked up? Six months. Now you complaining 'cause of one month? And you gonna tell me I can get my deposit back? Come bring my deposit so I can kick your ass... all up and down the fucking block, then ship him back to fucking Nigeria. You can't put hands on him. Why not? You put your hands on him and risk him calling the police. That's why you do the job to the T. You mean kill him? You gonna kill him? No. Don't have to kill him. Just bust his head to a coma. Put him in a permanent sleep. That is funny, though, because... Don't say that. Don't say it. Give me it! Give it to him and leave him alone. What is he crying for? 'Cause he went in there with the little stick. Give it to him. And y'all be nice. I ain't got it. E'niyah, give it back. Give it to him. And be nice. Don't start, 'cause I'll shut down the whole park operation, and everybody can stay home and have naps. No, I... I put to Elijah, because... It's supposed to be duck, duck, duck, goose! Well, we gotta figure something out, 'cause I'm pregnant. What? I mean, we havin' a baby. Another one. Yeah. That means bigger place, more room. We're a team. We'll do it. A kiss? This what I'm gonna have to deal with in seven months? We can't reach? It's gonna be worse. I love you. What's good? 'Sup, man? Chilling. Talk to me. What's up? I'm ready to make some money. Okay. This ain't no easy game, though. You know that, right? Yeah, I know. How much do you know? I'm not, like, an expert on everything, but I can learn. But if someone wants to run a kilo, how much would they make? Off a kilo alone, running that... He'll see more than three, five stacks. After you drop off, package is complete... Two minutes, you make one call. "Cookies are finished." Everything is in code. You never say, "The package is delivered." 'Cause then you just signed yourself over. And if you in this, you in this. Ain't no room for error. There's no room for slipup. First little small mistake... will get you a large sentence. Once that's done... You make everything seem so freaking... Everything sounds like a death threat, bro. Well, what path you think we on? I'm trying to... I'm trying to earn some extra cash, man. Bro, if you want to earn extra cash, get a job at Mickey D's. Come on, man. You know what kind of extra cash I'm talking about. All right. Well, this is what I'm talking about. We talking about the same thing. You said you want to man up. Ain't no room for boys over here. I'm listening. All right. So then listen. And like I said... You go for your pickup. You got cash on you. After you grip your package, one route. There's no stops, there's no in-betweens. Ain't no go see your girl or go see your mans. One route to the drop-off. A'ight. Nah. It ain't "a'ight." It's one route. I'm not saying I'm, like... Come with me. That's my son Sincere. Come. Come. Quick. Come here. Putt-Putt. Come here. They're not... They're not sharing. They're not sharing? Yes. Okay. What is that, a boo-boo? Let me see. Okay, listen. I need you to do me a favor. Look at me. Look at me. I need you to do me a favor. Daddy's doing business right now. Can you stay outside for a little bit for me, please? Yes. And I'll come get you? Yes. It's a deal? Yes. Can I have a hug? Don't gimme that cheap stuff. Give me the real stuff. Go ahead, fat butt. And I'll be outside in a minute, all right? Okay? Yeah. I ain't trying to be in this forever, man. I got my family to really provide for. They depend on me. But bottom line, everything I do is for my family. And there are certain changes in place right now for my family. Take it down to brown tacks, it's like... I don't touch a package. I got kids. Four of 'em. It ain't for me, you know? Like... Especially when I think about Sincere, you know, like... The doctors diagnosed him as being "autistic." I think my son is perfect. He's just different from all other kids out there. Because he chooses not to maintain eye contact with a stranger... My son is perfect. Come on, Zoe. Get down. Come on. So I'm gonna let you try, but don't fuck up. Do a run and see what happens. I got this, man. Ain't no sympathy in this shit. It's real. She looks like the quiet one. Tequila maybe. Enjoy yourself, baby. Take it. Have a sample. You always got some new shit. That's called Barack Obama. And this is Michelle Obama. Together, I call it Health Care. All right. See me at the end of the night. Swing back. You keep the sample. Yeah? What's up, guys? ID's? Both of you? Yeah. That's me. Lucky bitch. Thanks, man. He wanted to know if you could do security tonight at his club. For Tony Yayo, the guy from G-Unit. Bodyguard work or just... Yeah. It's bodyguard work. It's one night. What do you think? I'll do it. How many guys? You'd need, like, three or four guys. I got some people. See that Henny? I need a drink. See the liquor all out? Nah, I wanna pour my own drink. It's my brother. He shoulda came too. We played all right. Let me speak to him. - Hold it up. - Hold it, hold it. Wish he was right here, right now. Say, "Man, you missed the show." Been locked up for 12 years. Don't worry. He be good. Nah, 12 years is a long time. But he learning, though. Shit, yo. Don't smoke. Where I know you from?

Like, the hood got love for you, and I love the hood, but you gotta know when to, you know... I'm in and out. You know what I'm saying? I stop by, show niggas love. Appreciate that. Try not to be caught up in the bullshit, 'cause you know niggas die over petty shit in the streets, homey. You Blood. You from Brooklyn, homey. I already know what it is, nigga. Niggas ain't smiling where you from. Niggas definitely ain't smiling where I'm from. You can't wake up smiling and be happy. Nah. You gotta walk around with a certain kind of persona on.

For Dad, who I love. Boy." Ew! That's him. Thanks very much. She called me a boy, right, E'niyah? Shoot. That looks like a... I did not make nothing on this. You didn't make nothing? You just folded up the pink paper for me? I'll go make another one. Can you try and make me a triangle, please? I don't know how! I gotta hang all the pictures on the wall. You gotta make me a triangle so I can put it on the wall. I don't know how. Go ask Mommy to help you. Or do you want me to help you? I want you to help me. So go get a crayon, and we're gonna do it right here. That guy came knocking on my door. He said... Hi, baby. How you doing? Look at him. Spend some time with your titi. She came to see you. Hi, Titi. My God. You got so handsome and big. Where you going? I gotta, um... You know where he's going? He's coming with us for a caf con leche. We're gonna have some caf.

She around family. She a little too nice for you. Turn around for me, sweetie. Taking care of John? Of course. All the time. Don't work him out too much. I need him to, you know, be energized in the morning. Bye, brother. Why? Why? None of your business right now. We'll see how long you stick around. Come on, man. Watch your mouth, yo. For her? Yeah, man. Fuck outta here. Go ahead. Take her home, Johnny. You some disrespectful-ass nigga, man. What happened? John. What, man? Don't get too big for your britches. You're disrespectful, man. Where does your mom think you're at? She thinks I'm here, just alone. She probably knows that someone's over here. I don't want her to know that. She started talking to me about condoms earlier. So what else did she say? Did she mention anything about me? Of course. She always mentions you. What did she say? She said, "When is the wedding day?" My God. Shut up. You know my mom. And what did you tell her? Did you tell her a date? Look at you. Look at you, moving hella fast. I told her that I like you. I told her you were cute too. My phone is, like, going crazy over here. Why don't you put it on silent? All these people... I wonder who's texting me right now. It's not me. No, but, seriously, don't try to fight for something so hard. You might get answers you don't wanna know. What if I do wanna know? Sometimes things are better left unsaid. It was like when I was, like, seven. We were just at the park. And he would always run and I would always chase him, but I could never catch him. He was way too fast. And he grabbed my right hand with his right hand, and he grabbed my left hand with his left hand. He just started running, and I had to, like, try to keep up with him because he had my hands. And I could. For like a brief second I was running just as fast as him. And, like, I knew I was flying. I'm up! Are you up or are you awake? I'm up, Ma. I'm up. F... You better clean this room before you leave the house! You hear me? I got it, I got it, I got it, Ma. I got it. I mean it. Yes. I don't wanna work in no supermarket. Nene, you know, work is work. As long as it's honest work, it's work. This... What's wrong with the supermarket? Can you just stop by before you go to the park? I'll stop by and see what they're hiring for. Because Don Jose's waiting for you. I already talked to him about it. He's already waiting for you. Look at you. He gonna come up to me and gonna start asking me mad questions. Well, he gonna ask you questions to give you the job, John. I don't even wanna work there. You just walk in and they gonna hire you? But you setting me up for interviews you haven't even talked to me about. Cause if I talk to you about it, you're gonna say no. I'm just looking out. You're always doing that, Ma. I'm just looking out. I know you always looking out for me. So, what up, yo? You Primo boy? Primo sent me. I'm not his boy, man. My name is John. So whose boy you be? Melvin. You Melvin's boy? Yeah, man. Your old man was good people, man. Definitely, definitely. Well, come here, man. Let me holla at you, man. Yo, anything you need, you come holla at me, all right? I got you. Melvin was good to me. You heard? All right, man. Good looks, man. I got a little something for you though, man. Yes, sir. You know I respect that. That's just good business. Hold up, man. All right, let me see it. All right, I like that. I like that. Stay where you are. Stay where you are. My man. All right. Yes, sir. All right. That's just good business, man. I like that. Yeah, man. All right. Three hundred for two shifts. Thanks, bro. You should count that. I just watched you count it. I trust you. Well, um... Question: Kinda need some more shifts. You got anything going? Thing is, I only need bouncers two nights a week. Friday and Saturday. Well, I can kind of use anything right now. I got something. My sister's ex is a nut job. Nothing serious. But he just gets out of hand sometimes. I'll take it. Hold on. I'll call you later. All right. What's up, Ma? Hi, baby. What happened? I was outside. Come here. Come on, Ma. Come here. What's up? What's up? Stop looking at me like that, Ma. Come on. You think I don't know, John? Know what? Did you went to talk to Don Jose about the job in the supermarket? Come on, Ma, don't start with this. Please don't. What were you doing in the park? Nothing. I was just playing ball with Ant. Come on. That's what your father used to say to me, John. But I didn't pay attention to him, 'cause we were little kids and I was in love and... Come on, Ma. I'm not a baby. But you're my kid, John. I'm not a baby, Ma. You're not fooling anybody, John. You're not fooling me. Can you please stop asking me questions? I'm gonna go to my room. No. Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you. Come on. I really don't wanna talk right now. If you knew he was doing all of this, why you stay with him so long? Because I loved him, John. I couldn't tell you what he was really doing... because I was not there with him. He protected me from things like that. He loved you. He can't even protect me now. How does he love me? And when I needed something, he was there. When he would call... You don't remember because you were so young, but he... Ma, but it's not all about the money, Ma. It's not all about what he gives you every first of the month. It's not anything about that, Ma. He tried to be a father, a man of his house, but he couldn't. All he knew was the streets, so he went back on the streets, and I couldn't stop him. He just couldn't be here, John. He chose to be out there. You don't understand that. When people look at you, they remember your father. And sometimes people wanted to hurt him. And I don't want the same thing to happen to you... just because you remind people of him. And every day, every single time you walk out that door and you go to that park, all I can do is worry. Me and my father are not the same people, Mother. You're putting yourself in the same position that your father did. No, I'm not. We're not the same person. Hanging out with who knows... with the wrong kind of people. Ma, can I just go to my room? I really don't wanna talk about this right now. John. What? Don't walk away from me. I'm here. I'm talking to you, but you're not telling me anything. What is it that you want me to tell you? I want you to tell me who my father was. What... Who was he? I told you... Why did he leave me when I was five years old, Ma? Why? You're too young to understand. And that's all I hear over and over again... that I'm too young, Ma. Why does no one understand that I don't have a father anymore, Ma? And I don't have a husband! Like I told you before, Ma, just... I just don't understand this anymore. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know what people want from me. Everybody talks about my father, saying he's so... he's such a big man. Like people... people want me to follow in his footsteps. Did I told you to follow your father's footsteps? No, Ma, but I'm not talking about you. Who wants you to follow your father's footsteps? Who's putting all this shit in your head? 'Cause I know it's not me. He was in the streets and he got shot in the head, okay? For being in the wrong place with the wrong people. I don't want nobody knocking on that door... telling me, "Your son got shot in the head." How many times... in just one month you hear that something happened to somebody... out there in that street? Somebody got shot. Somebody got stabbed. I ain't my fa... They found somebody dead in a building. Me and my father is two different people, Mother. We two different people. That's what you think. You don't know, John. Looking sharp. Think it was a setup? I don't think it was a stray bullet. Who would wanna kill him though? Well, people get envious. He was handsome, he was strong and he could fight. A stray bullet to the head. I don't think so. I'm gonna jump to you, okay? Jump. What the hell? That was like a ballet jump right there. I wasn't prepared for that. I need to have weight structure, weight balance. My God, whatever. Salsa is like the same thing. Catching. Hey, hey, you gotta catch. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know Primo runs everything, right? That's what people say. But then my pop gets capped and it's, like, bad luck? What are you trying to say? How does my pops die and nobody knows anything? What do you... Okay, so this is what he looks like. This is the man you wanna look for. And I don't even know if he's gonna show up. But if he does, just keep it calm. I just don't want a scene. Just diffuse the situation. All the men. All the ladies. Grab a hand, girls. One, two, three! You gotta shake it better than that. Let's go. Get 'em up there! Get 'em up there! Whoo! All the way around. All the way around. One more time. Big pose for that camera. Give me a pose. Looking good. Let's go. Raise your hands! And now my man. For Rocky himself. Let's hear it for Adam. Grab a handle. Grab a handle. One, two, three! It's a coming-of-age thing. You know, the kid's gotta learn a whole part of the Torah. He's gotta sing it and read it. So he recites a mantra and, you know, memorizes it and says it out, and that makes him a man? It's kind of like a mantra. Yeah, I never thought about it... Yeah. Yeah, I mean... And we all know it's not really being a man. I mean, you're 13. He's got enough problems, but... It's kind of similar to what I do. I recited and remembered an oath, a pledge. Said it out loud to my brothers. Did my initiation, and... Now, this is for what? Initiation for... Being Blood, you know. Okay. Had to fight seven different dudes. What do you mean, at the same time? Yeah. Shows strength. When I changed and turned Blood, I was 12. After that, you get an oath. You get a pledge that you have to recite, you gotta memorize. You know, back in the days, you felt like, boom, I just fought seven dudes. You know, I feel like I'm a man. That's like my kid's age. I was 12. He's 13. Jesus Christ, he didn't have to fight seven guys. A lot of people look at me and say, "You know, Prim, at 12 years old, you're a kid." Behind that was I had nobody. And the only people that really embraced me and showed me love... was dudes that my brother knew, and, you know... I joined the life, you know. I made the decision that if I didn't have the family at home that I wanted, that the family outside on the streets, they accepted me. And... I can't give it up, but I'm ready for a big change. Like, I don't want the same things for my kids. You know, I don't want my son to ever feel like... the only choice he has is the streets. You know? That's why I take that time. I'm getting money. It'll be good tomorrow. Promised the kids I'd take 'em to the park. So that means you have to do it. Yeah. And they're not gonna let you forget. No, especially Nevaeh or Elijah. Why are you with me? Why am I with you? You make me happy. What's up, baby? What up? What's good? - Yo, you remember BB? - Yeah. All right. You remember RayLo? Yeah, what's up? Go over to BB's, pick something up and take it over to RayLo. I could do that, man. We need to get this shit popping. For real. Yo, what up, yo? What's good, RayLo? What's going on, big man? Hear you working with Primo now. Yeah, man. What's up? - Think you big time, yo? - Shut the fuck up, man. Yeah, you pussy. Shut the fuck up, man. What up, man? What you mean, shut the fuck up?

Tell your boy to take his tampon out, yo. All right. Fuck outta here, yo. Funny man. Tank-top ass, rookie niggas. Swag off the boat And I'm just hopping in the moat Fuck her up like a bad bitch No more side sit, doing the high flip fly, flip fly Flip fly, high tip Motherfucker, get outta here Hello? Yo, P. Man, that shit ain't touched down yet. He left a hour ago though. Well, I guess you got a problem, homey. All right. Heard. What up? Yo, what's good? Hey. What's up? Nothing. Just hanging out. What up, Ang? Hey. What are you doing? Man, I'm about to... I gotta go run real quick. Where are you going? Don't ask questions, babe. Just stop asking questions. I'm good. You good? Yeah. All right. I'm gonna holla at you, all right? Yo, Ang, I'm gonna holla at you. What's up? We all good? Yeah, we good. Took the long route home? I ain't know you was timing me. Why you looking at me like that? What happened? What... What happened? RayLo just called. He ain't get the package. What? Had a nice stroll? Nah... Yo, Primo, man, I gave him the package. Well, seems like we got a problem then. Grip everybody up. I mean, get 'em all together. And check in on RayLo and see what's up with that. All right. Cool? Yeah. Sit down, John. I gave him the package. If I find out otherwise, John, your pops is gonna roll over in his grave right next to you. Yo, Prim, man. I gave him that... Stop... talking. I put a lot of faith in you. You know that? You know what that means? Come on, man, I gave him that... Shut up. Look at me... and listen. Everybody is giving you respect... because of me. Because of who your father was. This business... this out there... is based off one thing... respect. Kasey. Benz. Vito. Midnight. They all work for me because of respect. You know why? Because they fear me. Because if one slip up, there are consequences. Even RayLo, he knows that. He wouldn't even think of coming to me... with that bullshit lie. I gave him... Shut... We been doing business too long, too right. But you... these motherfuckers is watching you. Then this happens? - What's good? - What's going on? Talk to me. So what happened? Your man ain't show up. Yo, why you lying for, man? You already know our history, man. Yo, fuck you, man. You really lying right now. Yo, you better get your man. You really gonna believe him? You really gonna believe him right now? Yo. Come on, man, this guy... Shut the fuck up. So you're saying he's lying. That he stole the package. And now he's saying he didn't. You know what that means? Speak! I know you know what that mean. RayLo is lying to me right now. That's what you saying. Did he take what was mine? - Yeah. - Son of a bitch. Yo. Yo. Yo. Kasey. Fuck this nigga. You already know. Get the fuck off. Come on. Don't worry about that. Get the fuck off. It's done. This out here... this ain't no joke, man. A young nigga like you... you get bodied, shit won't even make the news. You're just another number. Nobody gonna care. Nobody gonna stop. Nothing. Back there with RayLo, I was just defending myself. And I really don't care what you think about it. Then you're a ballsy-ass kid. 'Cause for once you standing up for yourself. You know, me and your old man used to come out here and kick back. Always at night though. He liked this place. He used to take me here at night too. Let me ask you something. What do you know about his murder? What happened? I know what you know. Stray bullet. Wrong time, wrong place. Wrong time, wrong place. I guess that's right where you don't wanna be? You know, sometimes... I feel like I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time. You ever feel like that? Son, that's where we were born. You think this shit is funny? Your dad would be proud. You look just like him. I don't look shit like him. Looks like little man might be growing up now? I'm not playing, Primo. I know how things work. There's no such thing as a stray bullet when you're involved. When people got beefs, they settle them. When my pops died, it's like no one had to pay for it. That's not how the boss man's supposed to live, right? That's what you taught me. Actions have consequences. Right? But you know what, John? It's not the first time I had a gun pointed at my head, homey. I remember the first time. Enough with the stories, man. Tell me what happened. You're a big boy, John. Figure it out. He got big. Too big. He didn't wanna do business... the right way. Everybody has bosses. Your pops act like he ain't have any. So it was his time. Sad to say, it's just business. So what you gonna do now? What your pops would've done? I ain't even know my pops. Maybe a basketball game. Maybe a trip to the beach every two years. But I thank you for teaching me. Now I know him. I understand him. I know exactly what he would do right now... or what you would do. But I'm not gonna even do that. Wah! Wah! Wah! Hah! I want ice cream! You want ice cream? Yeah. Ain't you just eat? Okay. Let's do it. Yeah, I had it all to the average eyes From my block to block they demand supply All the cash I earn got me cars to drive All the deeds I done they really got me five Yeah Really got me five They really got me five Yeah Really got me five Really got me five Five years in the pen I couldn't do that Ballplayer dreams Man, I couldn't do that I'm missing my team living our dreams Bars after bars Getting nasty on the scene Dolla after dolla It all seems fake Broken-up lines on this broken suitcase I said misunderstood Riding for the hood Five star, I said give your boy different bush Went to Fort Greene Macking with the team White so clean so I sell it to a fiend Then we flip it to a dream You can call it an assist Pass it to the right That's my main man Rich Flip it to the back Bolo beans on a grit I said my team all about it Ha-ha Yeah, I had it all to the average eyes From my block to block they demand supply All the cash I earn got me cars to drive All the deeds I done they really got me five
