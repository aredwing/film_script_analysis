A chain of galley slaves on their way to the penal colony of Toulon. The last galleys of the king had rotted long ago in the port waters. But the last convicts remained for everybody galley slaves. They were kept busy with hard labor, often of no use. That's what they called "going to penal servitude." Go ahead, fast. You, move. Father and son come to inspect. Good morning, chief. See this one? One couldn't tell, but he tried to escape two times. Fire in the hole! Watch it, you guys over there! It's over for them. They were here for life. Now they are at peace. Hey, there. Stay there. Come here. Lift your foot. You've filed your chain, you bastard. You want to escape? You'll do three more years. Meanwhile, off to the pontoon, double-chained to the bench. Go ahead, take him away! This convict was called Jean Valjean. He had been condemned to five years of penal colony for stealing one loaf of bread. Jean Valjean tried two more times to escape... and when, at last, came the day of his release... Go ahead! He had served 19 years. Here are your things. You go to the shower, the hairdresser, the delouser. Here is your count. One hundred and nine francs and 15 sous. Sign here. No, it's not my count. I calculated, it is 140 francs. Less 24 francs for Sundays and holidays, and 5 francs of city taxes. Go ahead, sign. Here is your passport. You will have to go to the local police station wherever you go. Otherwise... you'll be arrested and sent back here. Understood? Hey... if you get caught stealing again, you'll get life. If you threaten with a knife, even with a stick-- armed in any way-- it's death penalty. Think about that, unless you want to come back and see us. Freedom. Yes, they were given back their freedom, but their old convict's passport that had to be stamped everywhere was bound to their steps like ball and chain. It was almost impossible for them to find work and the houses and the inns remained closed for them. Not far from there, in the little town of Digne, in the department of Basses-Alpes, a Carriage bearing the coat of arms of the papacy was coming on the place de I'Evch. The visitor wanted to spend the night in the bishop's property. They told him that Monseigneur Myriel had left the palace because it was going to be changed into an hospital, and that he was living over there. The little house on the square. - Is Bishop Myriel here? - He went to do his visits. He shouldn't be long, if you want to come in. - Thank you. - Look, here he comes. - Where? - On the donkey. What? This poor little priest? You are right, Father, we tell him often his sister and me. His Grace doesn't take enough care of himself. He never keep any money for himself. If you could reason him a little bit... Good evening. - Your Eminence. - Please, don't. It is the first time I ever met a bishop with this sort of carriage. Yes, I understand why Your Eminence would be shocked. If you will allow me. He trotted a fair amount. You think a humble priest shows too much pride by borrowing a mount which has been used by our Lord. But I do it by necessity, I assure you, and not by vanity. - I don't doubt it. - Come. Come in, Your Eminence, come in. He is hungry. But maybe you are, too. I wanted to stop in your house tonight with my people but - I am afraid... - Don't be afraid. Your escort can go to the inn, but I insist on keeping you. I have an excellent bed for you. Can I have a look at it? I have such a hard time to sleep. - Please. Excuse me. - Thank you. The supper will be ready in a minute. When there is enough for three, there is enough for four. You would deprive me of a great honor if you refuse. You know how proud I am. - Here is my bedroom. - Thank you. Be careful, there is a small step. Here you are. We'll be neighbors. It is stocked with fresh oat straws. It still smells like harvest. Thank you, but this trip exhausted me. I need to rest. If you don't mind, I'll go to the Mayor's house. - I am not a monk. - As you wish. We are serving the same cause but not in the same battalion. The same night... Come in. Good evening. I am sorry, they told me to come knock on this door. Can I have some soup and a place to sleep? Of course, come in. My name is Jean Valjean and I come from the galleys. Yes, lady, the galleys. Come in. I left Toulon three days ago. Today I covered the miles on foot. I am tired. Give me your things. Mrs. Magloire will put down an extra plate. We will have supper in a moment. We will make your bed while you'll have your supper. - Come in. - I have money. I am not an innkeeper. Keep your money, sir, you will need it. You are the priest of the village. I can't put anything past you. Miss Baptistine, my sister, and Mrs. Magloire, my governess. Go ahead, give this gentleman a chair! Mrs. Magloire, go look for the silverware. We have a guest. Silverware. The same that would have been used for the cardinal. How could they have better shown an unexpected guest that here he was not considered a galley slave, but a man? These ladies are very happy to have you among us. When we have a guest, we embellish daily life a bit. And we drink wine. - Can I serve the soup, Your Grace? - Of course. This gentleman said he was hungry. Give me a chair. I am not tall enough to reach the shelf. You are surprised to see this wealth in the house of a man who should be the poorest in the land? This silverware comes from my grandmother. I am attached to it. Ah, it's a weakness, I know it. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Could you give me the ladle, please? Give me your plate, sir. You are probably eager to go to bed. Mrs. Magloire... you will put white sheets on the alcove bed. The next day, as always, Monseigneur Myriel began his day by visiting his garden. He was leaving Mrs. Magloire responsible for the vegetables and taking care of the owers himself. He used to say that beauty is as important as utility, maybe more so. Monseigneur! Monseigneur! The silverware basket! I had put it away last night, but it disappeared! Do you know where it is? Yes, here it is. But it's empty! And the silverware, the big ladle-- where are they? This I don't know. It is the man from last night, the convict! He is not in his room anymore. I was bringing him a glass of milk. His bed is empty. Good thing I took the candlesticks up to my bedroom. Go ahead, move, go on! Monseigneur! Look what this man had in his bag. We called him out to check his passport and to search him. This is what he had. As we knew that last night you had him for dinner, well, we arrested him. What did you answer back to them? Nothing. Why didn't you tell these gentlemen that I gave them to you? You even forgot your candlesticks. I had given them to you with the silverware, why did you leave them? Mrs. Magloire, go look for this gentleman's silverware. Go ahead! Go ahead! - You had given them to him? - Of course. - So, we can let him go? - Yes. And give him back his goods. I'll obey if you say so, Monseigneur. Why Monseigneur? He is not the priest? No, it's Monseigneur the bishop. Here. Thank you, Mrs. Magloire. Can I offer you a glass of wine, Sergeant? I would hate to refuse, Monseigneur. Mrs. Magloire, show them the way. - Follow me, sirs. - I will be right there. Thank you. Wait! You forget your candlesticks again. Come on, take them. Jean Valjean, my brother, I don't believe in the power of money. But this could help you to become another man. You don't belong to the bad anymore, but to the good. It is your soul I am buying. Jean Valjean left town as if he were running away. He walked straight ahead all day and then he collapsed, exhausted, on a log. He was feeling some kind of rage because he didn't understand the generosity of this man he had stolen from. So this was the truth. During twenty years at the penal colony, they had taught him a different one. - What do you want? - I don't want anything. - Then why are you here? - I was passing by. So pass. It's beautiful. - My coin, sir! - Go away. - Give me my coin back! - Go away. - Give it back to me! - Go away, I say! Eh, listen! Stop! Thief. He was a thief. He understood that he would pay for the silver coin his whole life. Complaint of Pierre Burloz called Petit Pierre. Armed robbery. Dangerous recidivist. Didn't have his passport stamped any more. Wanted. A few years later, the little town of Montreuil sur Mer in northern France rose unexpectedly. A humble craftsman of mysterious origin, Mr. Madeleine, was applying a new craft process to the manufacture of jewelry. Soon, he bought the most beautiful house in the region and transformed it into a hospital, while he came to live humbly on the other side of the square. After your hospital, it was a pharmacy free of charge. Then, an old people's home. A school for boys. Another for girls. At last, a help fund for the workers, which demonstrates your endless generosity and your relentless commitment to the public welfare. Your industriousness has brought prosperity to the entire region. Your big heart is chasing misery, ignorance, and illness. For these services, despite your dislike of honors, in the name of His Majesty, I appoint you mayor of Montreuil sur Mer. He had become Mr. Mayor. People said of him, this is a rich man who doesn't look pretentious, and this is a lucky man who doesn't look happy. When a little chimney sweep was coming into town, he asked to take him in and gave him some money. Word circulated, and many more came. But one day, another visitor came to Montreuil. All right. Thank you. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor, I wanted to introduce myself as soon as I arrived. I am the new Police Inspector. I was waiting for you. You will be the head of the City Police under my supervision. - I will be proud of it. - What is your name? Inspector Javert. Javert. Yes. Javert. Here is my nomination. Thank you. What is your service record? I joined the police 10 years ago. I did three years in Montauban, four in Moulin, four in Bthune. I am hoping to be appointed in Paris after my stay here. I hope it for you. In the meantime, I hope we will get along. I got the best training. My father was the head locksmith of the penal colony of Toulon. I spent my youth among the worst rabble. We had the indomitable, the headstrong. Mr. Mayor can't imagine. - I imagine. - No, you had to be there. First of all, do you know the rabble, Mr. Javert? It is simple. First, there are honest people, established people, then the ones who have no work, no family, no home. The first group makes up society and respects the law. The others respect nothing and attack everything. My duty is to defend the former against the latter. - It is not difficult. - Not so easy. Mr. Mayor, there was an accident. Old Fauchelevent just fell under his car. Oh, my God, I don't want to see this! We have to go look for Mr. Mayor! Good morning, Mr. Mayor. We'll have to wait 15 minutes for a hoist! Go look for a beam to use as leverage. I will never be able to. - You are going to hurt yourself. - Take this. Wait, you guys. That's it, he is lifting it! Come on, put the lever there. Quickly, GUYS- - Be careful. - He is in a bad way. It's nothing, buddy, you'll get out of it. It's nothing. - It's great, Mr. Mayor. - God bless you. I have known only one man capable of doing what you did. He was a convict at the penal colony of Toulon. His name was Jean Valjean. So now you know a second one. Like in all the little towns, there was in Montreuil sur Mer a class of young men who were nibbling on their private income, being deeply bored while they thought they were having fun. They had contempt for women, were drinking, yawning, smelled like tobacco, were playing pool, were not working, didn't have any use at all. They spent most of their time at the caf, summers... and winters. - Spade. - The doormat girl is ready to work. She is probably freezing her butt off. - I bet you Louis is going. - Goodbye! - You've lost, buddy. - Ah, the bitch. Stupid girl. - Wait, it's going to cost her! - Good luck! Are you coming, darling? Don't pretend to be shy. Hey, we'll have a good laugh. Bastard! Don't touch me, brute! Bastard! Swine! Let me go, let me go! It's the Magistrate's Court. Here, sign. You don't know to do it? All right. You're good for six months. Take her away. Six months in jail! It's impossible! I have my little girl's boarding to pay! My little Cosette, what will happen to her? They will throw her outside in the winter's cold! There is nothing I can do about it. If I do this work, it is not by vice, I swear! I swear, I had no more money! I sold everything... I have a little girl in the countryside! She is sick! I need some money. Every whore says the same thing. - Alas, it is almost always true. - Mr. Mayor... Ah, it's you, Mr. Mayor? You came to see your work. What I have become is because of you. Well, are you happy? I am going to jail! I was earning a living in your factory and you threw me out because I had a little girl without being married. What did she do to you, my little Cosette? She is not allowed to laugh and eat like the other children? I was not aware of all this. Why didn't you come to see me? Oh, it's so easy, what with the foremen who bar the way. A boss? What's the use? I don't know you, and you neither. All men are pigs! I have sold all my things, my furniture. I have sold my hair! I have sold my teeth! And you know what they told me? Well, sell the rest! Well, look at her, look at the whore! Look at your work! Bastard! Give this woman back her freedom. Come now, Mr. Mayor, this woman has insulted you, and a moment ago she insulted a bourgeois. Regarding the bourgeois, I investigated. He was wrong, and a good policeman should arrest him. I am sorry to contradict Mr. Mayor, but this girl committed an offense on the public road. It's in the police report. I do my duty, and I am keeping the Fantine woman. She'll be punished as required by the law. It's not as bad as that. She won't go to the penal colony. She won't go to the penal colony and she won't go to jail. This concerns the City Police. I am your boss, and I ask you to release her. - I refuse. - I am asking you to obey. Get out. Thank you sir, am I free to go? Oh, forgive me. It is me who ask you to forgive me. Unfortunately, I don't always know what's going on in my town. One thinks he is acting for the best and there are still injustices, but you could have come to see me. You know I am a man to whom you can explain everything. - So, you have a little girl? - Yes. My little Cosette. We'll take care of her both of us, you'll see. You'll be happy. I don't think so. I wish I had known. I wish I had known. I left Pan's five years ago. I couldn't stay there no more. You can probably guess why. But I was filled with hope, the weather was so beautiful. I wanted to go back home. - Sir! Sir! - Whoa! - Can you take us for a little bit? - Yes, of course. Come up. You're going far? - To Montreuil sur Mer. - To Montreuil sur Mer? Where is that place? - In the North. - You're nowhere close to it. - You're going to tire your legs. - I'll find a way. I'll bring you to the entrance of Montfermeil. You'll surely find someone else. So, you're going to see your daddy? Yes, he is waiting for us. Go on, whoa! Whoa! No, no one was waiting for us. I was not married, and Cosette's dad has abandoned us. To arrive in Montreuil with a fatherless child was impossible. I wouldn't have found work anywhere, I wouldn't have found a home. This good farmer left us in Montfermeil. Montfermeil. I arrived near the Thnardier Inn. There were these huge wheels with a chain underneath. It was used to carry trees. It looked like a canon barrel. But a mother had found a way to make a toy of it for her kids. That's what made me trust them. Bring your white sheep in Let's go to the cottage The good farmer had told me, "Oh, I think they are honest. He used to be a soldier, a sergeant at Waterloo." You have two beautiful little girls, Madame. Yours is very cute, too. Look at them, they look like three sisters. Madame, the Good Lord brought me to your home. I can see you're a gentle mom. Say, would you want to keep mine? Keep her? Yes, her father died. I have no more work in Paris, I am going home, but... with a child, it's not easy to find work. When I have earned some money, I'll come back to pick her up, I will be able to give you six francs per month. If it helps you. Between women, we have to help each other. First, I have to talk about it to my husband. My darling. My little Cosette, you're going to leave your mommy. She says she would give six francs per month. It's not enough. Seven. And six months in advance. Six times seven, forty-two. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Your wife spoke to you? You would agree? I am square in business and sharp about details. You have to pay in advance. Six months at seven francs. Six times seven is 42. I will give them to you. This is my count. I leave you to your calculations. My horses should be rested now. With all the water they drunk... - Which way are you going, sir? - Compigne. Compigne! It's on my way. Do you have a little place for me? - Of course he has a little place. - If that can help you. All right, goodbye. But hurry up, I am late. Send her to me right away. Ah, right away, right away. You'll give me 15 francs more for the first expenses. Forty-two plus 15 makes 57. I can give them to you. I have 80 francs. Go ahead, I am not watching. - She has some clothes? - Of course. You must give them to us! I wasn't going to leave my little treasure naked. They're in my baggage outside. So? If you want to leave, I am on my way. Yes, she's coming, right away! Don't worry. You can leave reassured. Your little one will be like our child. What's the name of this cutie? - Cosette. - Cosette? It's pretty. Why not? And you? Madame... Madame Fantine. I'll have a letter written for you as soon as I arrive. Thank you. You're welcome. When one can help people... go with her. I left her there, my little Cosette. And I never saw her again. And they ask me for money, always more money. Don't forget the clothes. I have worked. I sold myself. I have no more strength. It's too late. Doctor. How is she, doctor? Still in the same condition. She asks for her little girl. She is going to see her soon. I hope even tonight. May be then she'll feel better but... it is the last step of phthisis. And now, it's probably going to go fast. All these girls, they end up like this. She's not the first one we've seen here. Don't be too hard, sister. Do we do always what we should for these unfortunate souls? Even you. Even me. So you see... Mr. Madeleine, I am so happy you came. When you are here, it seems to me everything is better. And... Cosette? They went to look for her. When she'll be her, you'll feel better, I promise you. Mr. Mayor. What is it? You are alone? And the child? They refused to let her go. Mr. Thnardier is asking another 500 francs. But I think the more we give, the more he'll ask. - I should maybe go. - He won't give her up. We have to ask for her before going to pick her up, otherwise... Ask for the carriage to be made ready with a good horse for tomorrow morning, 4:00, in front of my house. - She knows how to write? - No, I don't think so. Ask for a letter to be written, explaining that the child should be given to the carrier, and tell her to sign it. Do what I asked and come to confirm it at my office. Yes, Mr. Mayor. I will be absent a few days. Here are the orders for Spain and England. See to it the fabrication starts right away. Very well, Mr. Madeleine. It's done, Mr. Mayor. The car will be ready at the time you asked. Very well, thank you. Here is a letter that Sister Simplice asked me to give you. Thank you. Come in. Mr. Mayor, Inspector Javert wants to see you. Send him in. What's going on, Javert? Mr. Mayor, a culpable action has been made. An inferior officer was disrespectful with a superior magistrate in the gravest manner. I am asking you to punish him as much as he deserves it. - Who is this man? - Me. And who is the magistrate who has a complaint with you? You, Mr. Mayor. I come to ask you to discharge me. What are you talking about? I could have given my resignation, but it is not enough. A resignation is honorable, and I must be punished. I have to be discharged. Javert, you are a genius in the art of complicating things. What did you do to me? I denounced you to the police department of Paris. You accused me of interfering with the laws of the police? No. I accused you of being the convict Jean Valjean. - Who? - I didn't have any doubt. I had known Jean Valjean at the galleys when I was a child. I couldn't be wrong. - You are crazy. - That's what they told me. You cannot be Jean Valjean because the real Jean Valjean has been arrested. Arrested? Yes, for a trifle. He stole an apple. He pretended his name was Champmathieu, but was recognized at the penitentiary of Arras by an ex-convict who was with him in Toulon. As I thought I was holding him here, I wanted to see him to be sure. I went to Arras, they brought me Champmathieu. So what? Mr. Mayor, the truth is the truth. It was Jean Valjean. I recognized him. - You are sure about it? - Sure. And what does he say, this Champmathieu? He says he doesn't understand a thing. He plays it dumb, simpleminded, but his future is sealed. What punishment does he face? There is an old story of armed robbery on a young boy from Savoy. When he was arrested, he had just jumped over a wall to steal apples. For a child, it's a mischief, for a man, it's an offense, but for a convict, it's a crime, it's the galleys for life. All right, you can leave, Javert. Mr. Mayor, I remind you that you must discharge me. No, you thought it was your duty to do so, I am keeping you. I don't need your kindness-- the kindness that makes you side with the prostitute against the bourgeois, with the policeman against the mayor. This kindness has no value. If I had not been mistaken about you, if you really were Jean Valjean, be assured that I wouldn't have been kind to you. We'll talk about it later. - Javert! - Mr. Mayor? When is this Champmathieu going to be judged? In Arras, tomorrow. There is a scenery larger than the sea. It's the sky. There is a scenery larger than the sky. It's the depth of a soul. In the name of His Majesty, I appoint you Mayor of Montreuil sur Mer. What punishment does he face? For a child it's a mischief, for a man it's an offense, but for a convict it's a crime, it's the galleys for life. Jean Valjean comes back... and Mr. Madeleine will sink into scandal and shame. Is redemption impossible? After your hospital, Mr. Madeleine, it was a pharmacy free of charge, then, an old people's home, a school for boys, another one for gin's. At last, a help fund for the workers. After all, this Champmathieu is a thief recognized, condemned as Jean Valjean. I just have to stay quiet and Mr. Madeleine will be safe forever. Jean Valjean, my brother, [don't believe in the power of money. But this can help you to become another man. You don't belong to the bad anymore, but to the good. It is your soul I am buying. When is this Champmathieu going to be judged? In Arras, tomorrow. Monsieur... the Royal Prosecutor... My little girl, what will happen to her? They will throw her out in the winter's cold. When you are there, everything seems to go better. Defendant, do you have something to add for your defense? Do you still deny being the convict Jean Valjean? My name is Champmathieu! Tell them, I was working at Mr. Baloup's as wheelwright. You can just ask. Gentlemen of the jury, I remind you that Mr. Baloup has been subpoenaed in vain. He was bankrupt and has not been found. The gentlemen of the jury will appreciate a system of defense that subpoenas for testimony people who cannot be found. You are really something. I have been in jail for three months. I have been pushed here and there. People talk against me. They tell me "answer." The gendarme pushes me and says "answer!" They always talk about Jean Valjean, but I don't know this person! Mr. President, we would like to call again to the bench the convicted Brevet, Cochepaille, and Chenildieu to confirm their testimony on the identity of the defendant. Get up! Come closer. We are still doubting the testimony of idiots who have been offered a trip as witnesses for the prosecution. Do you recognize the defendant as the convict Jean Valjean? - Sure, it's him. - It's him all right. I recognize him well. That's really something! What are you saying? I say it's something! Mr. President! Are we going to tolerate longer such a comedy? A comedy, indeed! - Who is this? - Mr. Madeleine, Mayor of Montreuil. Mr. President. Jean Valjean, criminal at odds with authority, ex-convict. I am he. Look at me carefully. You don't recognize me? Now you are witnesses for the prosecution! You'll have done it all. You, Brevet, you dirty little crook. Do you still wear the wool suspenders you were wearing over there? And you, Chenildieu? You have a date tattooed on your left arm. The Emperor's landing. First of March, 1815. Pull up your sleeve. Cochepaille, I don't ask to be thanked, but do you remember the quarry and the rockslide? - Yes. - And Montenet, chained next to me? - Who was called the Professor? - Yes. You remember, now? He was making necklaces with shellac bought from the sailors going to penal servitude. Of course! He had them sold back. He was making a good profit. That's something! Mr. Counsel General, Mr. President, this humble industry of a convict gave me the idea that originated my prosperity and that of Montreuil sur Mer. I think you won't have any doubt left of my identity. Now I have to leave, I have several things to do. You know whom I am, where I go. I wouldn't have come to give myself up if I wanted to avoid justice. Have me arrested when you want. You shouldn't sing like this, it hurts you. I can sing now that Mr. Madeleine will bring me back my little Cosette. Montfermeil is far from here. He won't be back today. Tomorrow or the day after. Be patient and everything will go well. I am patient. I have waited so long. Five years. My little girl is now... eight. I cannot believe it. I still imagine her little, as when I left her. Yes, I am patient. There he is! - No. - Yes, listen! I recognize his steps. - It's Mr. Madeleine? - Yes. You see, he hurried up. He knew I couldn't wait any longer. And Cosette, how is she? What's the matter? - Back already? - And the child? I am not coming from Montfermeil. I am afraid I won't be able to go. It will be a cruel deception for her. Good morning, Mr. Mayor. Good morning, Mrs. Devos. She comes to see her grandmother. Say good morning to Mr. Mayor. - Good morning, beautiful. - Good morning, sir. Good morning. Tell her that the child is here, and that the doctor doesn't want her to see her right away. Don't count on me, I cannot say this. Sister Simplice has never lied. - Such a small lie, come on. - There are no innocent lies. A lie, it is a demon. Very well. And Cosette? Where is Cosette? Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. She is here, your child. She's playing, you hear her? Oh, she is here. Oh, I want to see her! No, not right away. The doctor said you could give her your illness. You need a lot of rest, a lot of calm. In a few days when you're better, you'll see your little girl. But I feel just fine. I don't hurt at all anymore. I am even... very hungry. You have no idea how much children help you to go on. So, you covered all this road by carriage? I know it well, I did it by foot, in the old days. Mr. Madeleine, save me! Don't be afraid. He is not coming for you. I see you didn't waste any time. Come on, quickly. - Come on. - Mr. Mayor! There is no more Mr. Mayor. - Listen, Javert. - Mr. Inspector... I am asking you three days to go pick up the child of this woman. You'll come with me if you wish. Do you take me for a fool? Three days to go pick up the child of this girl? Cosette isn't here? Mr. Madeleine, give me back my daughter! Give me back my little girl, Mr. Madeleine! There is no more Mr. Madeleine. There is Jean Valjean, thief and galley slave. No! Cosette! Cosette! Are you pleased with yourself? I would advise you not to disturb me now. I will take care of your child, I promise you. Now I am at your disposal. To be an ex-convict is sometimes an advantage. The same night, Mr. Madeleine's servant... Mr. Madeleine! But I thought you were... In jail. As you see, I am not there anymore. I knew you were not a scoundrel. Did they let you go? Not quite. But listen, I never came here tonight and you never saw me. - Is that clear? - Yes. - Sister. - Mr. Mayor! There is no Mr. Mayor anymore. - Is it true, you have... - Yes. But then... To pick up her child, I needed my freedom, I took it. Take this money to bury her decently, the rest is for those without work. You must take it. It has been honestly earned. All my life, I only stole one bread and 2 francs. Thank you. And the little one, what will you do with her? I don't know. Javert will chase me. I hope the police formalities will allow me to get before him at Montfermeil. But after that... Go to Paris, 62 Rue de Picpus, at the convent of the sisters of Saint-Benoit. Tell the Reverend Mother that I am sending you. You will tell her... the name I abandoned 20 years ago. Eugnie de Blmeur. It will be enough. Excuse me, sister. The convict Jean Valjean, alias Madeleine, has escaped. He stopped at his house a few minutes ago. He has been seen near the hospital. You have been here for a long time? Yes. And you haven't seen him? No. In Montfermeil, there was a very old belief. People said that in the forest near the village, the devil came on Christmas night to bury his treasures. But that night... one could have seen a strange hobo digging the ground. Well, me, if I was lucky enough to meet him digging a hole, I wouldn't escape. I would tell him... can we share? Don't be afraid my loves. If the devil comes, mommy will chase him. Work, you! - What? My horse didn't drink? - Cosette! You didn't give water to this gentleman's horse? Oh, yes, Madame, the horse drank a full bucket. A tiny thing like this who such big lies. It's not true. This is no way to speak to a client. Go, toad, go give something to drink to this horse. Yes, Madame. But, Madame, there is no more water. - Then pump it. - But the pump is broken. So go to the source, go on. - In the wood? - Yes, hurry up. Don't be afraid. The devil won't eat you. You want to buy it? - No. - Why? You have no money? - That's it? - Yes. It's your mommy who sends you for the water so far away? I think I have no mommy. What do you mean, you think you don't have any? - I never saw her. - So who is this water for? It's for my boss, Mrs. Thnardier. Thnardier? What's your name? - Cosette. - Cosette? It's you, Cosette? Well, it took you a while. Madame, I found a sir who came to the house. - Do you have a carriage, sir? - No, I am walking. It's this way. He wants to eat. Strange weather, hey? Do you want a room? No, it's for dinner only. You must pay in advance. I will pa)'- - It's 40 sous. - All right. It's 20 sous, the price. Not for the poor. It stains a house to have these people. He's not even from around here. Work a little bit instead of looking. So, you have a good time, my loves? Yes, Mommy. Look how her little hat suits her. Such little treasures. Your horse has enough to drink. He is like his master. Here you are. What does she do here, the little one? She's darning my socks, of course. She must earn her keep, poor thing. A child we took as charity. How much do you sell your socks for? Sir, my socks are not for sale. And if I were giving you a Louis for it? A Louis? Here. Here, sir, they are yours. - With the meal, we're even. - They are beautiful socks. You can keep them. But now... this child's time belongs to me. Have a good time, little one. She wants to take my doll. You are leaving, sir? I am coming back. - Look what he gave me. - Who is that man? It's Rothschild! We must make him spit out some more of them before he goes. He left. It's a good one, at least. On my way out, I met Santa Claus. He asked me if I knew a Mademoiselle Cosette, and if she was well behaved. I answered yes. I am not sure I was right. It's a banker! Well, my Cosette, this gentleman gives you a doll! Take it, it's yours. What do you say to the gentleman? She doesn't need to tell me anything. I am just the messenger. Now it's may be time to put these little girls to bed. If Monsieur doesn't mind... holidays are work days for us. This cutie has to get up early. Go to bed, my lovelies. Say something, you, for God's sake. Yes, darling, we are going to bed. Eponine, Azelma, come too, my darlings. I am going to call her Catherine. It's also time for us to go to bed. You are waited for in your place. It's one hour you haven't drunk anything. Come on, go out. We haven't paid! Never mind. It's not Christmas every day. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'll put it on your account. Drink this. It's the wine I sell to the customers, a good one. Monsieur gives me a great honor. So you are coming from far away? - Paris. - Ah. Not a lot of people for a Christmas night. Ah, Monsieur, times are hard. We don't have a lot of bourgeois in our region. If we didn't have rich and generous travelers from time to time... You have a little servant who doesn't cost you too much. A fortune, she costs us. It's small, but it eats. It's incredible, how much it eats. And it's not strong. It cannot do much hard work. We keep her because she has no family. By charity. And she needs clothes. Winters are cold. And I have two more little girls, not to mention the very last one, a boy who came I know not how. Because of the cold. All of this costs money. And if someone would help you by taking her away? Taking who? Cosette? Ah, Monsieur, take her, keep her, eat her, and be blessed by the Virgin Mary and all the saints in Heaven. Very well, go look for her. I am taking her with me. - Right away? - Right away. - I am going. - One moment. Go to the kitchen, I have to discuss all of this with Monsieur. I truly adore this child. I noticed. We are not rich, but one has to do something for the Lord. I have bread for her. I love this little one. My wife has a temper, but she adores her, too. No, I cannot accept. We would miss her. I need to hear babbling in the house. Or... it's 1,500 francs. Go look for her. - Here you are. - Thank you. You're missing all the good opportunities. Fifteen hundred francs! He is stinking rich. You are right. - Here are your 1,500 francs. - What does that mean? I keep Cosette. I thought about it, and I cannot do this. It's her mother who entrusted her to me. I can only give her back to her mother. Or... it's 5,000 francs. You won't have one franc more. You mention her mother. You're right. Do you know this signature? It's a good imitation. Well, all right. Why you didn't show me this in the first place? Because I have my reasons. I have to think about this. Ah, no, I have to leave right away. You have time. You will leave tomorrow morning. All right. Show me my room. I am sure we will reach an agreement. Sergeant of Waterloo. Keep the carriage and watch the door. You, go behind the house and wait for me. I am coming in. Come. - Police. - Oh, my God. You are keeping the daughter of a so-called Fantine. She is still here? - Everybody is asking for her today. - Everybody? Everybody, indeed. A man came with a paper from the mother. - He left? - No, he is upstairs. - We come just in time. - You are not going to arrest him! - He owes me money. - Shut up, take us to him, quietly. Be careful, he is dangerous. Dangerous? I follow you, then. You, stay here. It's his room. You're caught! Nobody. I don't understand. I took him here myself. Shut up. We have to search all rooms. Not here, it's a married couple. Be careful, watch the doors. Don't be afraid. I am taking you with me. You want to? Quietly or the Thnardiers would take you back. Come. - Come on. - And Catherine? Where did you leave her? Downstairs? Hide here, I'll go look for her. There is this. It leads to the stable. She may have gone that way. He cannot escape. He is trapped. I am going. - Show me the way. - Nothing is burning! If you are here, say it, we'll negotiate. What a surprise. Let's share and I'll shut up. There is no one in the stable. He didn't go this way. Virgile! And this room, what is it? My little girls' room. I was just there. I am downstairs, where are you? What's the matter? You have him? What are you doing downstairs? Wait. Come on my shoulders. Go on. Some horses and a carriage, quickly! Go to Paris. 62 Rue de Picpus, at the convent of the sisters of Saint-Benoit. Tell the Reverend Mother that I am sending you. You will tell her... the name I abandoned 20 years ago. Eugnie de Blmeur. The convent's groundskeeper was wearing on his knee a bell that was chasing the nuns away, because they were forbidden to look upon a man, even from far. Cosette! Come! Come! I am sorry, Mother. Don't apologize, Mr. Fauchelevent. Fatherly love is blessed by God, but nevertheless... You shouldn't distract her from her studies. First, she has to forget she has been very unhappy. Where would be better than here to forget? You know, life is so hard. Here, she'll be safe, away from the world's temptations. She'll become a good servant of God. In any case, she'll be ugly. Not far from there, another groundskeeper was also dreaming while taking care of his owers. He used to be an officer of Napoleon, Colonel Pontmercy. Since the Restoration, he was getting half his pay and was forbidden to wear his Legion of Honor. He was only allowed to show his scars. His father-in-law, an ultra-royalist, had told him, "I will raise your child. He will be my heir, but on one condition: that you disappear." The officer was poor. For his son's sake, he had accepted. Marius Pontmercy had become a man without having seen his father again. Mr. Marius's grandfather asks for Mr. Marius in the living room. After 50 years in this house, I change servants very often, and their name is Nicolette. It's more practical to keep the same name. Your name will be Nicolette and you will have 50 francs per month. For the service, you will ask for Mademoiselle Gillenormand, my daughter. What is your nephew doing? Go check. In the room of this young man? The height of prudery is to multiply defenses in the places least likely to be attacked. - Yes... - You asked for me? Marius! Your father writes to us. He says he is sick, he wants to see you. You want me to go there? I know what you think, my poor child. It's not your fault if you are the son of one of these scoundrels who killed our king and bled France. But it's our duty to defend the family's traditions. It looks serious. It's not him who writes, it's the doctor. It's your father. Even if he was in the galleys, you would have to go. You will take the stagecoach tomorrow morning at six. This letter has been in my pocket for two days already. When he arrived in a dark room, he found three men. One was standing up. One was sitting down. And a third one was laying down and didn't wait for him anymore. And facing this deceased man, Marius learnt who was his father. Simple soldier, one arm broken fighting beside General Kleber, Second Lieutenant in Lodi, Legion of Honor in Austerlitz, one of the three survivors of the Eylau cemetery. Captain in Friedland for his 12th wound, Colonel at Waterloo. The Thnardiers were also at Waterloo. The wife was canteen keeper and he was sergeant. Can I come out? Is there any danger? - No. - And what's going on? The English are still resisting. Wait. I want to see this. Come! It seems to be going badly for the Emperor. Each of these lines is a regiment? And these others who walk and shine under the sun, it's the white cuirasses. It's at least 60,000 Prussians. And they are all fresh. The guard! Lay down or you'll go to your death if the officer sees you! - It's his last reserve, he is done. - Be quiet. Tomorrow, sweetie, we'd better become royalists. Close the ranks! Close the ranks! Close the ranks! Close the ranks! Hold firmly! And the night fell on 60,000 corpses. Great, an officer. Who won? The English. I have a broken leg. Don't let them take you. Me, I am done, but you, go away. They don't scare me. I'll get you out of here. I could even find a carriage, but I need money. - Your name? - Sergeant Thnardier, and you? Colonel Pontmercy. I will never forget. Don't worry. There. For my son. At Waterloo, a man saved my life. His name is Thnardier. I could never find him again. If my son meets him, he has to be as generous as possible with him. The Emperor made me a Baron on the battlefield. The Restoration is contesting me this title. My son will take it, and he will carry it, and he will deserve it. Baron! You are baron, now? What does that mean? My father bequeathed me this title, earned with his blood. And I will be proud to carry it. Your father? It's me! My father is a man who gloriously served the Republic, the Emperor, and France. And he made only one mistake: to love too much two ingrates, his homeland and myself. Marius! Abominable child! All these people were rogues, murderers, red bonnets! Thieves! Baron! You are about as much a baron as my slipper! All bandits who betrayed their king and served Robespierre and Bonaparte! All cowards who ran away from the English and the Prussians at Waterloo. Traitors and cowards, all of them! All of them, you hear? Down with the Bourbons, and this pig, Louis XVIII. A baron like Monsieur and an old emigrant like me cannot stay under the same roof. I am asking you to leave this house today. I'll be thrilled to do so. Father, you are quite right. Daughter, you are an ermine of stupidity without one stain of intelligence. Marius, without any money, went to live in a shack, not far from the gate of Italy... not far from the district of the horse market. Without quitting his law studies, he started doing translations to earn his living. But his neighbors didn't respect his work. Are you going to shut up? One cannot work here! You'll see, if I lose my temper! Only their daughter, Eponine, seemed to be interested in him. Here you are, finally. It took you a long time. Next time you'll hire me a hackney-coach. How she speaks to her dad, this one! My legs are killing me. I went up and down the floors, and everywhere it smelled like cooking. Everywhere the same answer: we have our poor. Here. 20 sous. That's all I got. And he wanted to caress my hands. To caress your hands, 20 sous? The world has fallen real low. I'll read you something that may be bring us more. Listen. "Mrs. Comtesse de Montvernet, 9 Rue Cassette." Cassette. It means big bucks. What a load of lies. "I am an unfortunate mother of six children. The last one is only three months old. Abandoned by my husband, ill, in bed in the worst misery. I send you my oldest daughter, hoping you'll have a good heart, with my deepest respect. Signed: Femme Balisar." They wouldn't have any heart. I hope to get at least three francs out of it. Here Gavroche, take this. You'll say your sisters are sick. - No. - That's how you speak to your dad? In the days of the Emperor, they would have straightened you out. You would be in the army, and they would teach you life. I said no. I am fed up with begging everywhere. If you wanted, you could work. I am not a man who does just any kind of work. - I used to be in the military. - Well, military salute, then. Beat it or I'll knock you out! There is someone next door, a student. A student! He should go to work. Good morning, Mr. Marius. Good morning. As many students, Marius was coming to work in the Luxembourg. He noticed the young girls looking at him. It used to make him at once shy and furious. He thought they were looking at him for his old clothes, and that they laughed about it. But they were looking at him for his charm, and dreamt about him. One day... on the next bench... One day, the eyes of a young girl have the power of creating in a soul this dark ower filled with perfume and poison that one calls love. He was missing a button and his shoes were dirty. He didn't dare follow her. The man and the young girl lived in a remote house in the Rue Plumet, where they were known as Mr. Fauchelevent and his daughter. And often, they saw him gardening. From a fellow student, richer than he, Marius borrowed a frock some gloves, and a hat. And she was wearing a new dress. She is looking at me. If I dared, I would get up and walk in front of her. She is looking at me, too. I would like to be handsome, to wear the war cross, to be on a horse. I am ridiculous. That young man looks very knowledgeable. - This young man? - Yes. Cosette. What are you thinking about? Nothing. Mr. Fauchelevent took a different path, but Marius followed them. So, Fauchelevent came alone. The next day, the bench remained empty. And the next day. And the following days. And all the other benches where he had seen her sitting. Not far from him, another man seemed to be also looking for someone. It was Javert, looking for Jean Valjean. The weeks passed, and Marius didn't again see this young gin', whose name was still unknown to him. But facing him were coming events that were going to shatter his life and inflame the heart of Paris. Down with Louis-Philippe! Down with Louis-Philippe! Wait a little bit! Oh, my God, the Reds! We'll go to all the schools! END OF THE FIRST PERIOD SECOND PERIOD The 1830s Revolution didn't bring forth the Republic but Louis Philippe instead, and France was restless. Citizens, General Lamarque is ill. They say he's going to die. He was the last defender of our liberties at the Assembly. If we lose him, we must fear the worst. Everything will reverse back to before '89. Marius had made friends among the Latin Quarters generous youth. Thus, he started spending time with revolutionary groups. The Friends of the ABC met in the back room of the Caf Musain, on the Place Saint-Michel. Gentlemen, here's your new friend. Their leader was named Enjolras. We're glad to have you among us. You've come a long way to get here, I think. Bahorel. Sir. Joly. You know General Lamarque is very ill. If he dies, the Republicans will stir and so will the Bonapartists. The rabble will try to take advantage to plunder and kill. Anywhere there is lead in Paris, roofs, monuments, gutters, that lead is being torn down to be made into bullets. That's right. Keep an eye on it and put a stop to it when the time comes. Each one of you will be assigned to a local police station. Here are the files on the suspects. Javert, you'll be at the Val-de-Grce station. Some students there belong to the Friends of the ABC; some rabble-rousers I'd like to see behind bars. The Claquesous Gang. I know them. Take care of them. In the hovel where he lived, Marius dreamt less of the Republic than of that young woman met in the Luxembourg and whose name he didn't know. Come on in. Hello, Mr. Marius. Don't you recognize me? We know each other, though. We meet everyday in the stairwell and in the hallway. You don't notice me. I'm your neighbors' daughter-- the Jondrettes. The room next door. You must hear us, though. A mirror! Look at me. No wonder you don't notice me. May I? What can I do for you? I was bringing a letter. - A letter? - Yes, from my father. No need to read it. He says the same thing to everyone; he's asking for money. It's all a joke. But we did used to have an inn in the countryside. Then, bankruptcy. Now, we eat when we have time. May I? It's good. It's hard, it breaks your teeth. We're used to it. We can't complain, though; last winter, we slept under bridges. We huddled together so we wouldn't freeze. My sister was crying. Sometimes, I felt like drowning myself. When I looked at the water, I thought it was too cold for that. I, too, had some rough times. I write copies at night. I unloaded bags in the Halles. You? You have nice hands, though. They're white. You're quite handsome, Mr. Marius. You're not any richer than us to live in such a hovel. But destitution is what we're fighting against. To each according to his needs. We would like bread and work for everyone. You know that General Lamarque is dying? - Who is he? - Our last defender. - Then we are doomed? - No, since we're here. We're preparing the revolution. The Republic. My father always tells us about the Emperor. That's all he talks about. That's not going to feed us. I still have this. I already had lunch. Louis the Eighteenth! Long live the King! A few days later, the young woman, hungry, walked by a bakery and succumbed to temptation. Thief! Stop her! Thief! - What is it? - Thief! Stop her! - Stop her! - She stole a loaf of bread! - What's going on? - A girl stole a loaf of bread. I'll take you to the police. Go get a police officer. No need to get a police officer. - Will you pay for the bread? - Of course. It's all well and good, but she's still a thief. She didn't rob the whole bakery. A loaf won't bankrupt it. Come on. Here. At this price, I'll sell you bread every day. Here. It's good. Meanwhile, the others go hungry. I knew you would be thinking about them. Let's bring them a nice meal, if you'd like. With two bottles of wine. My father is taking care of it. Miss? They just brought in the new dress. Do you want it? No! Take it. It'd make me happy. We're about the same size. Usually, rich people aren't like that. They give you old things and make speeches, and put their hands on you. They give you crumbs, like a dog. I'd like to bite them. But you... you're different. Shall we go? I gave her my dress. You did good. See? There are worse things than heartache. I brought a rich man! With his daughter. They saved me from prison. They gave me a dress! They're bringing food! We took a hackney coach! I think I had too much to drink. A rich man? - You, go to bed. - Why? You're ill. Lie down. - You, break a pane. - A pane? - Break a pane! - What for? To look pitiful. - Don't play tricks on them! - Shut up! So, are you breaking this pane? - I'm bleeding! - That's nothing! Illness, cold, blood--perfect. Careful. Who did you tell him I was? - My father. - What name? - I didn't give a name. - Well... I am... Honor Fabantou, actor. Go meet them! Are you done? This is our home. Come on in, young lady. Come on in, dear sir. My daughter told me what you did for her. The wretched kid, who stole a loaf of bread while her mother is ill! I raised her like an artist. And she's talented, sir. Don't worry, once you're gone, She shall pay for it. Let me get this for you, young lady. Bring a chair. Not this one. Bordeaux wine? It's baby Jesus in silk drawers. Take this. Sit down, Miss. Excuse the chair, we're very poor. You must be blessed with such a fine young lady. I, too, am bringing mine up religiously, to be honest and kind. They better believe in God or I'll smack them. You don't want to sit down? No, thank you. We won't stay long. Don't leave so soon. I should have welcomed you better, but my poor wife is ill. She's ill. Look at that man. Do you recognize him? Why? What's wrong? Look at him. And whimper, for God's sake! Shortness of breath. Comes from her age. And my other daughter is injured. It's broken. She's shy. She had an accident while working at the factory. Her arm was almost torn off. - My God! - Don't listen to him! The pane is broken. The fire is out. What misery! You don't work? I'm an artist, sir. I can't just do anything. I enjoyed some success. Yes, I know you well. I can't go near a theater dressed like this. And I owe four quarters to my landlord. He gave me until tomorrow. If I don't pay, he'll throw us out on the street, with my sick wife and my child with her wound. You won't end up on the street. I don't have the money on me; I'll take my daughter home and return. I'll be back around eight. Come on. Thank you. So, I'll be here at eight o'clock. Thank you, my benefactor! Thank you, Miss. See you later, dear sir, and thank you again. You are like Providence. You are God. Will we go see him when he plays somewhere? You won't have the opportunity to see him again, my child. 19 Rue Plumet. Follow that coach! It's 40 sous an hour. - I will pay on returning. - Payment in advance. It's beautiful! Will you let me borrow it? It won't fit you, you're too skinny. Don't touch it with your filthy hands! Father, she won't let me borrow it. Don't worry. Tomorrow, you'll have a satin dress and silk boots. - What? - You're crazy. You didn't recognize him? Poor old woman, she's blind. Who is it? All I can say is he must be richer than the Finance Minister. Too much money for one man. We'll tell Claquesous, he'll warn the Gang. Don't do that. It's not your style. Don't worry, this man doesn't like the police. You get it? Eponine! Where did she go? What are you doing here? I'm looking at myself. You don't notice anything? No. What's wrong? - Are you sad? - Yes. - Is the General dead? - No. You're not ill, are you? You were kind to me the other day. Now it's my turn. Can I help you? I'd like to. - Listen... - Yes, talk to me. The gentleman and his daughter who came by your house... You saw her. You like her. You find her beautiful. Beautiful... Do you know where she lives? No. - But you can find her. - I don't think so. Here! To your health, Mother! Here you are. Where were you? I needed you. Tonight, we'll go visit your gentleman and his daughter. Where do they live? I don't know. What do you mean? I met them in the street. - And your dress? - She had just bought it. - And where's all this coming from? - They bought it for you. Go back to the store and ask, they must know him there! - No. - What? I don't want you to hurt these people. Is that how you talk to your father? Don't touch me or I'll scream! Don't count on me to help you with your nasty tricks! Your plan is ruined. I won't let that pest ruin my plans. Leave! You're always underfoot, not working, not talking! - Where do you expect me to go? - Out! Come back tomorrow. Tonight, I want to be free. Go! It's been several years, but I recognized him at once. That scoundrel hasn't changed much. Some people never age, I don't know how they manage it. He didn't recognize me because of my beard. And you know what? The beautiful young lady he calls his daughter... - No! - Yes, it is she! - That one? - That one! Dressed like a princess when my daughters don't have a gown to wear! I'd like to jump on her stomach with wooden shoes! Don't worry. Tomorrow your girls will look like princesses and you'll wear a fancy dress that will turn young men's heads. And we'll eat chicken! But not charity chicken. I'm tired of misery. I want to have my turn now, before I rot! I, too, want to be a bit of a millionaire. Not so loud. The neighbor... That long-legged ass? Listen, we'll tell Claquesous. He'll warn the Gang. The other one comes at 8, the house will be empty. The student will be out for his politics. The hunters will be alone with the pigeon! He'll have to make a sacrifice! Come in. Inspector, a man is bringing us an interesting case. - Political? - No... but it could help us catch the Claquesous Gang. - Mr. Marius Pontmercy? - Yes. Thanks for warning us. We've been after these villains for a while. You promise to catch them in the act, but they're dangerous. - Are you afraid? - Not more than you. I suppose that you're armed? No, why? In that case, take this pistol. Conceal yourself in your room, Let them think you're out. Observe. We'll be posted around the house. We'll let the men go by. Let them do their thing, but not too much. Enough so that we can catch them in the act. When you think it's time, fire one shot in the air. - I'll take care of the rest. - Understood. One word of advice, Mr. Pontmercy. In the next few days, avoid your young friends who want to change the world in the back room of Caf Musain. My ideas concern no one but me. Give me back the pistol later. I hope they're on time. - There's no one next door? - He's out. With his politics, he's never back before midnight. Let's make sure of it. Go check. No one's here! A hackney coach! Hurry up! Block the door if need be. Yes? Come in, my benefactor. It's so good of you to have come one more time. I told you I'd be back around 8. It must be 8, then. We don't know; I don't have a watch anymore. How is your wife? She's dying. But she's so brave. She's not a woman, she's an ox. Your daughters aren't here? No, the wounded one had to go to the hospital to be bandaged up; her older sister went with her. Did my benefactor bring the rent money? - Yes. - Thank you. - Here. - Thank you. Sit down, dear sir. Sit down with me; I have a proposition for you. Here. Paris is no good for you. You'll never lead the honest life you deserve here. Too many actors like you and not enough tickets sold. - That's true. - Isn't it? I thought you'd need a new country. I'll buy you and your family a trip to the Americas. I'll set you up with some money so that you can wait for... the acting parts that'll suit you. Some money? How much? A thousand Louis. A thousand Louis?! Sweet Jesus. Shut up! Excuse me, sir, but women only think about money. For us men, the heart talks. I love Paris. I can't live away from Paris. I can't breathe. Two leagues away from the Seine and I'm breathless. It'd take a lot to forget Paris. I said, a lot. You're making a mistake. You should leave rapidly with what I offer you. Your future would be brighter. My future or yours? I'd like to show you something that explains why I love France. It's a picture, but a masterpiece. I'm attached to it. But if you're interested, I'll be willing to part with it. We're in such poverty... Take no heed. It's just a neighbor. His face is black because he's a coal worker. People come and go here; It is God's house. It's a very valuable picture. David painted it. He got his inspiration from my own story. "To the Sergeant of Waterloo." I'm the Sergeant. I'm saving a Colonel, pulling him from under corpses. That's the moment when I'm saving his life. The picture doesn't ring a bell? You haven't seen it anywhere? No. If I could sell it for enough money, I might leave France. What value do you set upon it? Three francs. We're all here, we can start now. First, look at me. Don't you recognize me? Like this, without the beard. The inn at Montfermeil, with the sign of the Sergeant of Waterloo. Don't you remember? Thnardier. I am Thnardier. What do you mean? I don't know you. You don't remember? You don't know who I am? I do. You're a bandit. That's how rich people call us! We're hungry, so we're bandits. You eat truffles, asparagus and green peas in January. When you want to know if it's cold, you look at the thermometer. But for us bandits, our skin is our thermometer! Step aside. Let us work a little. Don't let him escape! Don't hurt him. Sit him down. Pick up the table, it'll be more proper. Pick up the table. There. What is he waiting for? Let's go see. No papers, no money. You think you're so smart? But you'll give us your address, dear sir. You don't know it? I'll tell you. See how nice he is. Where do you live? On the Vendme Column. Bastard! Wait, I'll make you talk. Bring me the brazier! Good, good. You'll be good and give us the address. Then we'll go get your beautiful little lady. When she's here, you'll be happy to give us all the money we want so that we don't hurt your little treasure. Go ahead and shrug. You don't want to talk? Wait, he's gonna yell. No, the gentleman won't yell. He doesn't want the cops to show up. When he came to get the girl in Montfermeil, the cops were already chasing him. So, are you gonna give us the address? No. Do you remember knocking me out in my attic? You think you can make me say what I don't want to say? Here, look. You're not men enough. The old man is too tough for you. If one of you doesn't mind the heat, let him come closer. So? You, the brave Sergeant. And you, the Terror. You might be vicious, but you're weak! Let me take care of him! - Having fun, my friends? - Javert! Don't worry, I'm not alone. You're 6, we're 15. Let's not fight. Hi, Montparnasse. Hi, Gueulemer. The whole Claquesous Gang. Right, kill me. My men will get you and in three months... I surrender. That's good. All I'm asking is that I get tobacco in solitary confinement. Granted. Take them all away! Let's go! Don't forget the Missus. Bitch! She pinched me. Cowards! You're no men. You claim to be free and you get caught like chicks! Watch these two! Jean Valjean! Stop him! General Lamarque is dead. Read all the details. Read The Constitutional; General Lamarque is dead. Read General Lamarque's last words before his death. Thank you. My friends... may his death be the opportunity for the Republic to be reborn. His last word was... "Motherland." His motherland... our motherland... is the Republic. France and freedom are but one. General Lamarque's funeral will take place in 3 days. All the citizens of Paris will go with him for his last trip. Gentlemen... that day, we'll show if we're ready to lead a free life... Or die. Mr. Marius, there's someone for you next door. - Me? - Yes. One breaded chop! Are you asking for me? You don't recognize me? Eponine. I'm in disguise because the cops are after me. Don't count on me to help you. You don't think I was in on it, do you? I saw you bring them to your father. You're a well-organized family. You have no right to say that! If I had wanted to, the young lady, right now, would be... But I didn't want to reveal the address. My father was furious. I was itching to, but I didn't give it. - Are you telling the truth? - Yes. - You know the address? - Yes. Why didn't you give it to me? - Because. - Because why? If you can't guess, I have nothing to say. I have better things to do than play charades. If I give it to you, will you believe me? If I give you the address right now, will you believe me? What will you give me for it? A kiss for New Year's Day? Rue de Plumet, number 19. The gated house. With a garden. Are you happy? Rue Plumet. Jean Valjean was abruptly leaving the house for an overnight trip. He had made a grave decision. He knew that this retreat was no longer safe. That sooner or later, the ghosts of his past would come through the gate, along with that young swain Cosette dreamt about. "O Spring, you're a letter! Write her. Tell her I sigh and yearn, away from her. And I wanted to die because I had lost her. O, may the garden, the house, the limb, the leaf, may everything become a soul and tell you about me. You hold my hand when I walk in the shade And the rays of light come from your eyes. If I were King, I'll give my kingdom, my scepter And my people on their knees For a kiss from you That I will take tonight." Tonight... That night, in the woods of Montfermeil, a peasant woman thought she saw the Devil unearth his treasure. Meanwhile, Rue Plumet... The next day, Paris was burying General Lamarque. Are you coming with us, Mr. Maboeuf? We're going to topple the government! - I'm in! - It will get rowdy. - That's good! - Sabers and gunshots, Mr. Maboeuf! - That's good! - Even cannons fired! That's good! Get in the procession. All right, Chief. Present arms! Stop! Let us through! Let us through! The Army with us! Let's honor General Lamarque! Lamarque at the Pantheon! Lamarque at the Pantheon! Lamarque at the Pantheon! Lamarque at the Pantheon! Lamarque at the Pantheon! Unharness the horses! Lamarque at the Pantheon! Lamarque at the Pantheon! At the Pantheon! At the Pantheon! Let's not fight on open ground. Let's go to the center of Paris. - We have to get weapons! - Let's go! I have a rifle and bullets! - Let's go! - I'm in! They fired on the people! We're powerless here! We need guns! - You'll ruin me! - The Revolution will pay you back! - Now, to the barricades! - To the barricades! - Hey, friends! - Over here, guys! - We're coming, guys! - We're hiring for the Republic! Come on, students! We'll control Rue St Denis with our weapons. They won't dare come close. Tomorrow, we'll be the assailants. Let's go, friends! Let's go! "Au raisin de Corinte?" No "H"? A wine shop; I like it. Enjolras is the king of strategists! Hi. Good! Put this over there. We'll put the injured here. Upstairs will be our citadel. The floor is very sturdy, the bullets will hit it like a hammer. - I have an idea, sir. - What is it? Let's have a glass or two to the Republic's health. You're dead-drunk. Go away, you're a disgrace. I didn't drink it all, there's still some left. Take these bottles upstairs, we can use them as projectiles. Give me that. I don't mind dying for the Republic, but I don't want to die of thirst. Your idea, then? Over there, working. See the bald man over there? He's a spy. Are you sure? Just last week, he almost ripped my ear off for taking lead to make bullets. I know him as well; I dealt with him not long ago. Wait. - Who are you? - I see what this is. - A spy? - Inspector Javert. Let's take him in the wine shop. If things go wrong, we'll shoot him. Right now, let's not waste bullets. Go. You again. You still haven't returned my pistol. Meanwhile, Jean Valjean, having packed all his belongings, was preparing to leave France. While waiting for his passports, he was going to a secluded apartment he had rented in Paris. Are you coming? We should be in London in 8 days, after we get our passports. 7 Rue de I'Homme Arm. "My Beloved... We are leaving for England and I'll die if I lose you. Rue de I'Homme Arm, number 7." Eponine knew that whatever events were unfolding in Pan's, the night would bring her Marius. Cosette? Cosette? No, not Cosette. You? - Are you disappointed? - What are you doing here? I was waiting for you. She's gone. I saw them lock the house. They won't be back. Gone? Do you know where they went? I heard the man tell the young lady they'd be in London soon. London? It's far away, isn't it? She didn't leave anything for me? A note, a message? No. Where are you going? We're fighting in Paris. Remember what I told you. The great upheaval has begun! I used to be afraid of dying. Now, it doesn't matter to me. I almost wish for it. Let me come with you. We'll have a laugh. Watch out. Let's go around, there's a passageway. Listen. It's the bell of Saint-Merri. Mr. Enjolras! The soldiers are approaching! Disperse! Otherwise, we'll charge! Wait! Soldiers, listen to me! The night hides you, but I know your faces. You could be my sons! In '89, I too was 20 years old. But I was fighting against the Bastille, for the Republic! Join us! Let each of us defend this dead old man as he would defend his living father. His garment will be our flag. Watch out! Line up! Aim properly. Don't waste your bullets. Forward! Get rid of this rabble! Fire! Fire! Give me your weapons! Forward! Show no mercy! Stay calm! Get rid of this rabble! Take this away! Here, Marius! Stand firm! Surrender! Show no mercy! - Surrender! - No mercy! Watch for the Powder keg! Run away or you'll blow up! - Victory! - Long live the Republic! They ran away like rabbits! Reload your weapons! Tend to the wounded! Without you, I'd be dead. Bravo, Mr. Marius! Mr. Marius... Mr. Marius... I'll take you. We'll fix you up. I'm in too much pain. Leave me here. It's no use. Stay with me. I saw you throw yourself in front of the musket. Why did you do that? Why? I saw they were aiming at you, I couldn't... We will meet again. Is it true? Will we meet again? Yes. But if everyone meets again up there, it must be the same drama as down here. True. I have a letter for you in my blouse. I found it on the bench. I didn't want to give it to you. But that's funny, I can't see you unhappy. Do you remember when I gave you the address? I asked you what you'd give me. A kiss on New Year's Day. But it's only June. - Promise me... - What? - Promise? - I promise. When I'm dead, you'll kiss me for real. Yes. I think I was a little bit in love with you. Eponine was laid to rest next to Father Maboeuf, and Gavroche understood what family could be. Immobile, Javert was waiting for his fate to be sealed. The dead were lined up in the street. There they were, next to each other, made to get along, but society had turned them against one another. Grantaire had managed to find something to drink. Gavroche was playing. Marius was finishing a letter. Will you do something for me? Something? Anything! I'd like you to deliver this letter. It's too early for the post office. Exactly. Miss Fauchelevent, Rue de I'Homme Arm, number 7. Right away. "L'Homme Arm"? I like it. The name fits. Better leave my belt, it doesn't look like a mailman's bag. Rue de I'Homme Arm, Jean Valjean wasn't sleeping. He knew there was fighting in Paris, but that's not what was keeping him awake. He had ed the police, but he sensed another danger against which he felt powerless. As soon as they arrived, Cosette had retired to her bedroom. She refused to have dinner. "Beloved... To England... Will die if I lose you." Finally! Does Miss Fauchelevent live here? What do you want from her? None of your business. I need to see her. You're bringing her a letter? Can't you tell? From the student? You know Mr. Marius? Yes, he's a friend. I have to give it to her. She's asleep now. Give it to me, I'll give it to her tomorrow. Tomorrow's today. There might be a reply. Give it to me, I'll wake her up. Hurry up, I have to go back to the barricade. Barricade? What do you think we do while you're all sleeping? I'm waiting. "My Beloved, farewell. I'm going to die with my friends. When the sun rises, my soul will be near you." Marius. What if he kept the letter? The man would die and she would never know. Ever. He only had to let it be. "You'll forget him and I'll keep you." I think I fell asleep. Is the young woman awake? There's a reply, but I'll take it myself. Lead me there. It could be our last morning, Enjolras. - Any regrets? - No. Not of dying, but of killing. Leave the officer for me. What a shame to kill this young man. He could be your brother. He is. Aim... Fire! Soldiers, let's take this out. Forward! To your bayonets! Let's go, firemen! - To your bayonets! - Aim! Fire! - Don't step back! - Hurry, it's started, over there. Fire! Cease-fire! - Victory! - Long live the Republic! Another one of these victories and we'll run out of bullets! It is said that Gavroche heard that sentence. I was born in Nanterre, 'Tis the fault of Voltaire; And not in Palaiseau 'Tis the fault of Rousseau. Gavroche! We have to change the Ministry, 'Tis the fault of Voltaire; The cops and the dogs 'Tis the fault of Rousseau. Come back! Soldiers exaggerate, 'Tis the fault of Voltaire; The sparrows are to blame, 'Tis the fault of Rousseau. I'm not an owner, 'Tis the fault of Voltaire; I'm a little bird, 'Tis the fault of Rousseau. I have fallen to the earth, 'Tis the fault of Voltaire; With my nose in the gutter 'Tis the fault of... I got hit! Take the bullets. Let's go! - He's dead. - Give him to me. - Let's put him near the others. - Where? This way. - What about Prouvaire? - Taken prisoner. Aim... To France! To the future! It's Prouvaire. Your friends have just been shot. The last one alive will break your head. - You want me to do it? - You? Yes. - Do you know him? - Yes. If you don't mind, I'll take him outside. Do as you will. Your situation is no better than mine. You, here. It figures. Get up. Take your revenge. You go first. Attention! At the ready! A clasp-knife. You're right, that suits you better. There, you're free. There's a palisade at the end of the street. Go that way. And if I come out alive, you'll find me 7, Rue de I'Homme Arm. I don't understand. You never understood anything. So... Aim! Fire! Reload! Let's go, firemen! To the bayonets! Let's go! Forward! - Fire! - Bayonets! Don't back down! Don't back down! No mercy! Inside the wine shop! Let's go inside the wine shop! Go, go! Axes! Bring axes! Tear down the door! - No more bullets. What do we do? - Quick, the bottles! Line up! Wait! I'm one of them. You can't leave without me. - Who are you? - No one. Aim... Fire! Stand down. JEWELRY During the first riots, the generous citizens had opened the prison doors. Along with the innocents, the worst bandits came out. Well, there! This is my home. I've been robbed. Take him to the barracks! I'm not a revolutionary. I'm an honest man. My hands are clean. They don't smell like gunpowder. - We'll see. - Watch out, shots fired! Well, this is bad. A riot strengthens the government it doesn't topple. It tests the Army, concentrates the bourgeoisie, stretches the muscles of the police. We only have to track the survivors. Some might have fled through the sewers. But where will they go? In 15 minutes, all the exits will be covered. The Army has patrols at each collection point. If fugitives go up the sewer lines, they'll end up in the Catacombs. No one ever came out of there. If they go down, they'll end up at the Seine. Good. Congratulations to our friend Javert for escaping the insurrection. But take care of closing the gates yourself and have them under surveillance. Yes, sir, don't worry. We'll catch them or they'll die like rats. At the center of the city, Jean Valjean had escaped the city. He went from daylight to darkness, from uproar to silence. From thunderous explosions to stagnant tomb. The labyrinth had a thread: its slope. Following the slope would lead to the river, to salvation. Did you hear that? Something's moving over there. Hey, over there! We're the 6th line. Sergeant Lachenal, 24th patrol. You should be more careful. You almost fired at us. - We saw something. - A rat? You had too much to drink, right? Chief... Good golly! I know now why the cops are after you. That's great work. And you called me a bandit! Nasty word. So, good deal? Don't touch. Don't touch! You're too strong. You're hurting me. You're looking for the exit? I have a master key. - How? - Look, the key to freedom. But you have to share. All right. But you can't leave your big shot here. Throw him in the Seine. - I'll do it. - You need help? - No. - Selfish man. I already told you I was your prisoner, but first let me take him to his house. Marius Pontmercy is one of their leaders. He belongs to the military justice. - He already paid for it. - But he's not dead. Here. He had this on his person. "Please carry my body to my grandfather's, Mr. Gillenormand, Rue des Filles du Calvaire, number 25." Summon a hackney coach! What is it? What is it?! - Mr. Gillenormand? - Yes. We're bringing him his grandson. Mr. Marius! Lay him there. Dear God! What happened to him? He went to the barricade. We're bringing him back. Marius! My son! He let himself be killed at the barricade through hatred of me. Go fetch the doctor, you idiot! He did it against me. That's the way in which he returns to me. Woe of my life! He's dead! No, he's not dead. After you. Marius, Marius! Son, you're alive! He's alive. Grant me one thing more. Let me go home for a moment. Then do with me what you please. 7 Rue de I'Homme Arm. Wait for me, it won't take long. One moment. Why did you save my life this morning? You don't know why? No. I pity you. Jean Valjean wanted to tell Cosette that nothing could prevent her happiness if the man she loved recovered from his injuries. The street was empty. Javert was gone. Life had regained its course. Hope and love were regaining their place. At Mr. Gillenormand, grandfather and grandson had made peace, and every afternoon, they received the same visitors. Aren't they adorable, the both of them? Everything would be so much better if I could know. Know what? My memory is fuzzy. Someone was carrying me. We were in the dark. Who is this man who saved me and wants to remain anonymous? The wedding was the following day. What happened? Are you hurt? I out myself while chopping wood. You know how clumsy I am. Clumsy? You? Let me see. It's nothing. I'll tend to it myself. I... Sick and feverish after his injury, Jean Valjean was unable to be present for the ceremony. I'm late. You'll be all alone. Are you sad? We'll come see you tomorrow. Am I beautiful? Very beautiful. - Are you happy? - Very happy. Well, then, laugh! "You hold my hand when I walk in the shade And the rays of light come from your eyes." If I were King, I'll give my kingdom, my scepter and my people On their knees to feel your eyes on me, Cosette. - I'm not Cosette anymore. - Who are you? My name is Marius, Mrs. Marius. Come in! Sir! I'll let the Mademoiselle-- I mean the Madame-- know you're here. Don't disturb her, Toussaint. I wish to talk to Mr. Pontmercy. Good morning. Cosette will be glad to see you're better. Your absence yesterday surprised us. - Please, sit down. - No, thank you. I wanted to tell you something. I'm an ex-convict. I didn't hurt my hand. I was never in pain. I pretended to be hurt so I wouldn't have to sign anything, so as not to commit a forgery. What does this mean? I spent 19 years at the galleys and was then sentenced to them for life for a second offense--in absentia. I am an escaped convict, and my name is Jean Valjean. I've had doubts for a while now. Something awful was hiding behind you. But I was afraid. I kept my eyes closed. Why are you telling me this today? Because Cosette told me we would live as a family, and I can't belong to any family. For her sake, as long as she only had me in her life, I had to accept the danger of my presence. Now, I gave her to you. She's happy. I hope so, at least. I need to vanish from her life. I'm only asking for your promise that she won't know a thing. I promise. Thank you. I have one last favor to ask of you. May I come see her every now and then? I got her when she was little, and you probably understand how one can love a child. Even a man like me. I could stop by while I'm in the area, say hello to her. I don't think that's a good idea. Each time you'd come here, I would be worried about her. It's better if she forgets about you. But for many years, I was all she had. I'm afraid that, if she doesn't see me at all, she won't understand and will be very unhappy. You don't believe so? You think that for her, everything that isn't love has ceased to exist? Where are they? Father! You're here. No one told me. I came to bid you farewell, my child. Farewell? - I'm leaving for England tomorrow. - Again with England? I abhor England! It wishes to keep me away from my loved ones. He's been wanting to go there for a while. But now that you're rid of me, you shall take advantage. You'll be able to travel. I'm planning on settling there forever. Forever? Impossible. You'll die of boredom over there. I heard that it's always raining. - Will you write us? - Of course. Father was afraid of your opposition. Me? Why? Just a thought. Madame is served. Madame... Well, I'll leave you too alone. Farewell, Cosette. "Farewell"? Goodbye! Goodbye. Pity for the unfortunate, but indulgence for the fortunate. An old woman with rheumatism and nothing else to do but look out her window, noticed the strange outings of a man who seemed to be getting older before her very eyes. Cosette! Marius was obsessed with the thought of that man who saved his life but had never come forth. The person is waiting. "Monsieur le Baron... If the Supreme Being had endowed me with talents, I might have been Baron Thnard, member of the Institute, but I am not so. I merely bear the same name as he. I am also in possession of a secret concerning a person. This person concerns you. I await in the anteroom. Respectfully, Thnard." Thnard. Could you give me a moment? - This person... is it a woman? - No. Let him in. I've had the honor to meet Monsieur le Baron. I believe it was at the Countess of Bagration's. I don't know Madame Bagration. Ah? Then it must have been at Chteaubriand's. I know him very well. He's very affable. And? Monsieur le Baron didn't read my letter? I have a secret to sell you. What secret? Monsieur le Baron, you have in your house a robber and assassin. In my house? No. Assassin and robber. I'm not speaking of long-forgotten facts which might be erased by prescription. I'm speaking of recent facts, still unknown to justice. This man has crept into your confidence, and almost into your family, under a false name. I'll tell you his real name, and tell it to you for nothing. His name is Jean Valjean. I know it. But what you don't know is that he's an ex-convict. I know it. Monsieur le Baron surprises me. But you can see that I'm well informed. But what I have to tell you is known by myself alone. It is an extraordinary secret. I'll sell it for 20,000 francs. I know that secret as I know the others. 10,000 francs and I'll talk. You have nothing to tell me. Still, I must have dinner tonight. I know everything, even your name. That's not difficult, I had the honor of writing it to you. Thnard... - ...dier. - What? - Thnardier. - Thnardier? Also known as Jondrette, the poet Alvares, Fabantou the actor. Father of Eponine and Gavroche. You hurt me there. I lost my oldest daughter, my poor little boy. They died for the Republic. Monsieur le Baron, you're right, I am Thnardier. See? I know as much as you do. Jean Valjean is a robber. He was sent to the galleys for robbery. A small robbery, I must add. Still, Jean Valjean is a robber and an assassin. - Explain yourself. - That's easy. On June 6th, the day of the riots, I, for personal reasons, unconnected with politics, was hiding in the sewer. - The sewer? - That leads to the Seine. Sometimes, circumstances lead an honest man to step into... dirty water. And I saw someone I knew well; I had met him a few times. - It was our man. - Jean Valjean? Himself. And he wasn't alone. He was carrying someone on his back. A young man covered in blood. A flagrant case of assassination, were there ever one. The robbery was the motive for the crime, of course. That young man didn't have any money. Come on! Jean Valjean offered me half of what he'd taken out of the young man's pockets for me to let him out. He's a man of terrible strength; I couldn't refuse him. You came to accuse a man; you have justified him. Mr. Thnardier, you are a Scoundrel! - The word is strong. - I saw you in action. But I have a debt to repay that you know nothing of. Maybe you've never even deserved it. You want to go to America. Come back tomorrow, I'll give you what you need. Thank you, Monsieur le Baron, but I don't understand. I don't ask you to understand, I ask you to get out. As you please, Monsieur le Baron. - You said tomorrow, right? - Get out! We should have him taken to the hospital. He doesn't have any servants. I can't always watch after him, I have to mind my lodge. Too late for the hospital. He's a worn-down old man who must have lost someone close to his heart. One dies of this condition. Will you come back, Doctor? I'd rather it be someone else... Father! You're ill! Why didn't you say anything? It is you, my child; you came. How nice of you, my little girl. You came too? Please forgive me. Now I know everything, and so does she. Come with us, you'll be happy. We'll never leave you again. I'll come to get you tomorrow morning. It's too late now. No, it's not too late. Don't cry, my child. I was so worried I wouldn't see you again, and then you came. I'm so happy. Do you remember Montfermeil and the wood? When I took your bucket and held your hand for the first time? And the large doll? You know it is still here? And the convent, when you put cherries on your ears? My child, the moment has arrived to tell you your mother's name. It was Fantine. Remember this name-- Fantine. She knew as much misery as you have known happiness. She loved you dearly, and she suffered terribly. My children... I must confess, Marius... that I did not always like you... and I ask your forgiveness. Love each other dearly and always. Because in the end, only one thing matters in this world: Love. Love. Take these two candlesticks with you. I hope the man who gave them to me is satisfied with me. I have done what I could. Another thing: Don't forget that I'm a poor man, and when I'm gone, have me buried under a simple stone, no name on it. That is my will. You're here, my child. I'm happy. He sleeps. Although his fate was very strange, he lived. He died when he had no longer his angel. The thing came to pass simply, of itself, as the night comes when day is gone. THE END
