And so you will be able to use them for always taking care of children. So what is sacred is conceived. Sin is not sacred. Sin is not sacred. Neither sin is holy. Sit down with your Bible and say, "Lord, forgive me, please." Poor of their sins and problems. Think about it. What could be worse? Honey. Honey. Money is temptation. Go to the kitchen. Spread the word of the beloved Jesus. Send this temptation and guilt out. And give to the Lord. God bless you all. What can we say more? You must be powerful. You must help yourself. Without you I can not do anything. I'll tell you one thing, Mom. - What is it, baby? Already a man. We have tried for a while to start, but ... I do not think it will happen. Or it could be as well, she may just work. Carl, you know I just want you to be happy. If you think it is wrong, then you need another woman. You will do this? Arrange another woman? I found this nice ... - Missy. I do not know, Mom. Maybe I should do. Carl ... This is hard work. It is up to you to save yourself. Jesus is your guide. This is something you really want to do? So do. I love you, Mom. I know, baby. You're a good boy. Mommy loves you very much, more than life itself. It's not fair! Missy, go to your room and close that curtain behind you. But ... - Now. Do what your grandmother says. I can not make them believe. I want you to know that the Lord loves you. And I love you. My dear little boy. Ask the Lord for forgiveness. Forgive me for my carnal desires. God is my witness. Clean my good deeds. Hi, Judy. How are you today? Alright. I came to see if you need earthworms to your store. I wanted some fish before the old Johnson back from your trip. Judy, you will have problems. Invading property to fish. - Not just for fishing. I camped there last night to swim. - You're a smart girl. Come back later. And bring me the worms when they are ready later. You will not betray me, will you? Well, if you bring all these worms to me ... I say nothing. Ol pessoal! How are you? - Well, are you? Well - you have bottled water? Yes, the left back there. You are passing through or you're going to stay here? We will stay here for the weekend. Let's stay in Woodland Bed and Breakfest. - Go enjoy, there is wonderful. The most beautiful places are there, there are three miles from there. If you enjoy walking, I can recommend Ricks Trails. Hiking, walking you mean, right? You have a fantastic range of pigskin.

Will you still buy? OK. His worms. - Thank you. And are not mine. Judy. Carl. Carl? What are you doing, Carl? - I'm going home, Judy. I gotta go to mama and Missy. - How's mom and little Missy? I wanted to go there some time to say hello. Mom does not like people go to our home. You can see it in church Sunday. - You go to church on Sunday? I'm not going to church on Sunday. I have much work to do on the farm. I have no time for church. Maybe I can go after church to help you. You know what I can do farm work. I've done this before. no Carl ... - Judy. Mom said that the temptation is a sin. That's what she said. - Carl, Missy is not ... Did you hear me, motherfucker? I'll turn it off and cut it like a deer. Do not deceive me. There are people here now. I'll talk to you another time. If not at home at 11 am, will spend a week of house arrest. You got it, mister? Ok I love you. Do you have children too? - No, no, not yet. You are better off without them. I'm crazy with my son. He thinks he can really spend all night out. Anyway, you are ... - Mike and Lisa Ingram. In fact. You must sign in to register ... and I need your driver's license to make a copy. Here it is. Here you are. Everything is in order. The breakfast is 8:30 am. And dinner is at 18:30 pm. Here is the key to your room. The bathroom is at the top of the corridor. It is a common bathroom. If in doubt call a zero phone in your room, and I'll be here. Grande. - Any questions? It's all right. - Remember, "Our house is your house." Thank you. - We are a family now. Thank you. - Thank you. The fear of the Lord is his treasure. Get down on your knees and pray to the Lord in their lives. If you take a life of pain, misery and discomfort ... you will find glory in their home. - Mom. The glory is redemption. Glory in the Holy Spirit. You were there when he was preaching. This man is a good man there on television. A good man, I tell you. What do you want? I think I found it. You do not know when it is responsible. really. And who is she? - I do not know her name. I saw her today. She is not here. She is at her aunt's place. I think I finally found the right, mother. Calm down, you're going too fast. See what happened to that last? She is so beautiful. She will ... give us a beautiful baby. Make sure this time that she is right. And bring it home to Mom. It should also take care of a little Missy. Have pity. What is it in like the last person you brought home. Yes, Mom. I know. Mommy, I saw Judy today. She asked if he could come along, but I said no. She is the reason why you should listen to your mother. Never should have done what he did with it. It was outrageous. No, mother. I know I made a mistake. But I thought ... What I said about thinking? Do you think that my mother sends. You can do everything ... what mom says you should do. Without Him you all go to hell. Sit down with your Bible. I miss the conversation of the preacher. I do not know if any of us will go to heaven or not. Lord forgive me, please. Poor of their sins and problems. Empire to the column. I am confident his column. I bring you help and give them guidance. Shut up, woman. Stay here together. Stand up! Mother, mother. Give me a break. Thanks, Mom. - You're welcome, dear. Oh Dear God, today is a hell down here. Look at you, sometimes you sweat a lot. When you will finish the work with that jeep? You still have to do what I was talking about? Mom, I had hoped to go to town to see my girlfriend. What the hell. I'll have to do all this work here on the farm? No, mother. I just wanted ... - And what you wanted? You wanted to play a game? And pay attention, either go to hell? Mom is bricando with you. Mom has a sense of humor. Mom is funny. You can go see his girlfriend. I call the village. Difficult to pronounce. Village. It sounds funny. It's okay. A weekend away. In Bed and Breakfest. We deserve it. You deserve it. OK. Where do you want to start? - You follow me. I'll be your guide the rest of the day. - The rest of the day? The rest of the day? - The rest of the day. This was ... wow. Yes. It was delicious. - No, great. Large Grande. And I have a very good choice. But it was great. That was great. Fabulous, amazing, the best ever. Always. - You are dead. Hello - Hello Is there anything wrong? - Of course not. We'll check it out. This morning? I thought it would be longer. No, I would like to do. - Now, look at that. I made a mistake here. Give me the key and just sign here. It is beautiful here. We will definitely return. So, I see them again soon. - Thank you. Sister, I made a mistake. They just left. What? Carl will be very upset about it. I know. I screwed up. Sorry, sister. You have their address? - Do you have pen and paper? What a shame. What could I do now? I can move your body to one side ... and tell my mother had not seen for some time. Or tickle her for a moment. What are you doing now? - I'm just kidding, Dad. Boba. I must tell you something. His new girlfriend ... her aunt called and said she went home today. No, Mom, no. Carl. Calm down. You know your mother and aunt are always thinking of you. Go ahead. I want you to go get it. Mom wants you to go today. Yes, Mom. Carl, do not you dare fail. This is what you want. You'll be okay. For all of us. I will not let you down, mother. Of course. Anything else? This is your first meeting. I want to cause a good impression. Mom... Take the key, Carl. Do not break my baby. I had a great time this weekend. What did you do? I think that was one of the five best tours we did. Better than the sickness on the cruise. I could not help it. Boats are not my thing. You taught me a lesson. - I know. Have you checked the door? - Yes Does it really locked? - I promise. I look twice? - Please? Thank you. - Anytime. It's locked. - And the back door? Mike? You can check the back door, please? - I'll look. Lisa? I do not smell of breakfast. I forgot to buy bacon? Lisa? Stay here together. Stand up. I really appreciate you bringing all these things. But I swear I did not even let myself die of hunger. Do not worry about it. Questions were asked and we were worried. Say that all goes well and thanks that they are concerned. Nothing is the same. Sometimes ... Sometimes I just think about quitting. But I would not. It's just heavy. She will always be in our hearts. - She is not dead, Lewis. Jesus Christ! I'm stupid. She came ... - No. It's okay. - Sorry. Sometimes, some cops are looking for now. They operate around the clock. - I do not hear anything from them for weeks. They do everything in their power. - Weeks. Really? That's funny. I do not see here. Unless you? And what can they do? Dig it off the ground now? I am sure that if they did, I would receive a phone call. Maybe they found? Is she here? You are here, Lisa? This last trip Lisa and I ... that was one of the most beautiful trips. I want to return. - You want to go back? I want to return. - Why? I do not know why. Happy memories perhaps. I wonder where she is. We all want that. Holy Bible Do you still believe in God, Lisa? I believe... It is not always in the right place where you want it to be, but ... Yes, I think there is a God. I can live with that. Curse. Son of a bitch. Let me see. - No, it's nothing. Wait a minute. Carl, let me see your hand. - No, stay there. Honey, I need to see your hand. It'll be alright. Keep it clean, and ... and put some medicine. Well you take care of me, Lisa. You know I appreciate it? Carl, you really enjoy? You are an angel sent by the Mother of God. Carl, you gotta let me go. I gave my best to adapt the life you gave me here ... but are not sure. Not good for me. I must return to my life. Do you understand? You're a good man. You are kind, sweet and caring ... The sooner we stop thinking that way, it will be better. Mom likes you. And Missy like when you play with it. Soon we will begin to make a baby. Please, Carl. No. - You're doing fine. Keep it up. I hate having to do love me the strength. So love me, too. This is the only thing to do. Or it's all over. What is it? Why are you crying? I do not belong here. This is not my home. - I know this is not your home. But if you have a baby, you're free. After a while. What do you mean? Do not tell dad or grandma that I told you so. But once you have a baby, daddy will let you leave. So you can never go back. If I have a baby, Carl let me go? Missy? Where is your mother? Missy, where is your mother? You should not ask me questions. You know that. Missy. "Please..." Do you know where the key? What?" Where is key, Missy? Tell me where is the damn key. Missy, I'm sorry. Missy, I'm sorry. Sorry! Missy. Missy, I'm sorry. Dear God, why have to do everything myself? Carl? No, Carl. Please. no No, please! No, Carl. no No, Carl. No, please! Hey? Are you okay? Do not move. Are you hurt? - Calm down. Need help? Ok? Where you going? Where did she going? - How do I know where she is going to? Come on. - What do you mean by "come on". We will follow. Come on. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, ok? Mike. What the hell is this place? Hello. I asked: "Are you okay?" I think something is wrong. Does it hurt? - Are you hurt? No, Mike. There really is something wrong. Missy, what are you doing at the door? Oh, Jesus. Can I help you? We passed the road and the girl was lying on the road. We wanted to make sure she is ok. - It's ok. Sometimes she does this bricadeira. Thank you for worrying. - Sure. Then she okay? - I told you she's fine. I'd like to go away now. You are trespassing. Go away from here. Come on. Lewis ... Come here. I think ... What do you think? - I do not know. These people have something to do with the disappearance of Lisa. What? I have to call the police. Give me your cell phone. Wait a minute. "Shit! I left the jeep. - Go get him. Hurry up. Hello, 911. Lewis? Lewis? "Damn. That was too close." Jack was very concerned now. "I don't think they'll get out there for a while." Oh, shit. "Damn. That was too close." Jack was very concerned now. "I don't think they'll get out there for a while." Carl, what's going on? I do not want. We do not have time for that. Tell me what's happening out there? That curse, Carl. Mama could never say no to you. Come on then. If I do, then tell me what is happening out there? Carl, my dear, what is happening out there? There are bad people there? Carl, you're the man of the house. You know your mother? How do you think Missy or Lisa or myself We can sleep when there are bad people out there? You need to fix it. You have to go out and do whatever is necessary. Be careful. Mom will not survive if something happens to your precious child. "Damn. That was too close." Jack was very concerned now. "I don't think they'll get out there for a while." "Damn. That was too close." Jack was very concerned now. "I don't think they'll get out there for a while." Mom does not like when people come to visit her. Lisa? Lisa? Right here. Lisa? Mike. "You'd get hurt." No. .. Mike ... I'm stuck. Where's the key? - I do not know. You can not break? I'll be back. - No. I promise I'll be back. Shit ... back ... Stand behind. Shut up, woman. Strength End... Dead woman. He's dead. Let me see my baby. - He's dead, I said. Give me my baby. Damn, he's dead. What part of "dead" do not you understand? Prepare yourself. Stand up. Soon I will put another seed in you. Everything will be alright. What the hell are you doing standing, woman? Go back and lie down. Give me my baby. Shut up, woman. Carl. I'm going home, Judy. I gotta go to mama and Missy. Judy. Mom said that the temptation is a sin. Never should have done what he did with it. It was outrageous. Where is your mother? Legend pt br, saredes
