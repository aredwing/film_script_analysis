What the fuck are you doing? Fuck, you scared me, man. "You scared me, man." What took you so long? What's with the cousin? Your sister is freaking out, she wants to leave. Relax. We had trouble finding her. - Here. - Oh, thanks. Alicia, this is Brink. Hi. Alicia, you made it. Mmm. You smell like American shampoo. What? It's different outside of the U.S.? "Is it different?" you said. Agustin. Help me! This is Agustin's sister, Barbara. This is Alicia. My baby cousin from California. Hi. How was your trip? It was good. It was long. Is this your first time in South America? Um, it's my first time outside of the U.S. Oh. You're kidding me? Guys, we need to go. It's late. No. She's been on a plane for hours. She needs to take a shower. Really? This radio only plays CDs. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. Come on. What a drag. Relax, bitch... Do we really have to rush to the South? Yeah. Trust me, you don't want to stay in Santiago for long. It's fucking boring. Oh, is the South gonna be better? How long does it take to get there? Like 12 hours. You can get a good sleep in the car. Yeah. That's true. Hey, I'm sorry my mom was so pushy about me coming here. I guess I just needed a break. Oh, shut up. Don't be silly. I'm so glad you're here. Well, thank you. So, what's with you and Agustin? It's serious, right? Uh, yeah. It's good. We'll see what happens. And who is that Brink guy? He and Agustin met at their gringo high school. His dad is a diplomat or something. Agustin brought him here especially for you. Yeah, he seems fun. Sara? I'll just be out here. Don't be too long, okay? Okay. Okay. I'll just... I'll keep calling her. Alicia! We're gonna be waiting in the car. and I cum! No wonder... the pussy... is in the dick. No wonder... the tits... are so milky. One more... and I cum. Agustin knows this guy. Pedropiedra. He is so fucking weird. Right? Remember when he performed in his underwear? I remember. English. Speak English, please. He pissed on the audience. So gross. How long have you been in Chile? Longer than I expected. Like two and a half years. Yeah. We're gonna get Sara to stay longer, too. No. She has one semester and that's it. Yeah. I don't know. We'll see. Can you turn the music down a second? Hola. Uh... One second. It's Paloma. Uh... Okay. Um... Barbara, can you please pull over? Sara, what's going on? It's okay. It's just school. Fucking great timing. What are we gonna tell them? Paloma. Good, so anyway... Yes, we want them. Are they dangerous? Any possible complications? Can you tell her to tell him that I'm on my way? Fuck. I saw this coming... Sara has to go back for an exam. Guys, don't kill me. I have to go back to Santiago. I'm so sorry. What? Yeah. Today? Right now? It's just gonna be you, me, and Barbara, and her? No. I'm going with her. We're gonna get a bus in Tijuana or something. Are you crazy? I'm not gonna take care of your friends. Barbara, it's fine. I'll go by myself. Don't worry about it, Agustin. I'll be fine. No, no, no, no. Are you crazy? I'm coming with you. No, no, you can't. I'm just going for school. I'll be back tomorrow. It's fine. Sara, of course, I'm coming with you. Are you kidding me? I just got here. I wanna be with you. That's why I came out here. Let's go! Okay. We'll see, all right? Let's go. But you don't really have to go. I just don't believe you. It's an exam. Who cares? Well, I care. I mean, I've already failed one exam. And I have to graduate at some point. It's important. Yeah, but you never cared before. We're in Southern Chile. What are you doing? I'm gonna be gone for, like, one day. And they're really sweet. Have fun with them. Yeah, but, Sara, like, what's the difference, you know? If I come with you, then we could just come back together. You'll have so much more fun if you stay here. And you've been traveling for so long. Just get there already. No. I don't want to let you go by yourself. I'll be fine. Agustin, what's going on? This is stressing me out. You're lucky. The next bus is leaving very soon. Yeah. I'm really lucky. Hey, Agustin. Can you talk to her? I don't think she should go on her own. Okay, Alicia, enough. Be nice to her, okay? We'll be nice to her. Agustin, we're gonna be so late. What's keeping us? Barbara, would you mind if we slowed down just a little bit, please? Barbara, slow down! No, Melda's waiting for us. Who is Melda? The caretaker's wife. We're picking her up. Can we change this shit? Come on. You pick one. I don't really know that much about music. Be adventurous. Just whatever you find. Don't worry. Agustin, stop reading this stupid hypnosis book. Here. What does it say, anyway? Put me in a trance. Put me to sleep. Shut up. Come on, hypnotize me or something. Seriously? I like it. This shit gives me the creeps. Sorry. What the fuck? Just leave it. Great pick, Alicia. I'm really sorry. I'm kidding. Don't worry. This happened before. It hasn't happened to me. Well, not in a while. Alicia, don't worry. It happens all the time. Folks, here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher She was a red-hot hootchie-cootcher She was the roughest, toughest frail But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi Hi-de-hi-de-hi-di-hi...

These people must be pretty exotic for you. Yeah. It's really rustic. It's not like they're wearing feathers, you know. Why are these sheep here? Sir? Do you know where I can find Melda? Maybe at Lorenza's. - That one? - Yes. Thanks. Baby, sorry. Yeah. She's all right, I guess. What's it called again? Mapuches. White people in this country have totally fucked them up. Are you Mapuche? You already paid for them? Everyone here is Mapuche, right? Are you freaking out? But you speak Spanish? Is it gonna be enough? Good... Okay. I have to go. I'll call you again later.

Have you ever had a girlfriend? Yeah. Um... Not in Chile. In the United States... We broke up, 'cause... Has anyone talked to Sara? I tried to call her today, but... I talked to her. She sat next to that screaming baby the entire way. Fuck that baby. Well, she's coming tomorrow, right? So, it's not that bad. Yeah. True. True. Agustin. Does this shit work? Yeah, it should. Is there ammunition? Uh... I think. Maybe there. Hey. Take a look at this video. That video doesn't do anything, Agustin. Whatever. You should try it, though. Relax your eyes, and stare at the center. He's good. He once cured this stomach ache I had for two days. That's disgusting, Barbara. What's wrong with your body? What's wrong with your face? Shut up! It's never worked for me, so don't feel bad if it doesn't work. Can I look away now? Agustin, stop it. She's not liking it. Why don't you finish what you start, Alicia? Okay, now... Hey! This. Whoa.

I'm kind of trapped up here. No. I'm trapped here. What? I just want to get out of this place. What? Alicia, what? I can't hear you. Hello? These people are sadists, Sara. What? Alicia, those people are my friend. Hello? Baby, I can't hear you. Hey, can you... Can you tell Agustin that everything is going well, and can you ask him to call... What? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? I can hear you perfectly. Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Alicia, can you hear me? I can't hear you, Sara. Just call me back later, okay. Hey, did you talk to her? Who? Sara, who else? Who else what? C'mon! Did you talk to her? What did she say? Yeah, she'll be here tomorrow morning. What's with all the questions, man? C'mon! Are we playing or what? Come on, I dare you. No, too close. I dare you. I'm gonna get you! Hey, hey. Hey, friend, hey. Come here, come here. What are you doing out here? You should be working. No? Lazy dog. Ugh... Stop it.

This room is toasty, toasty, toasty. It's fucking freezing out. I'm not making lunch. There's a lot of things in the kitchen. Take whatever you want. Hey, sorry about that dog. It's getting old and crazy. Yeah, he thought you were a bitch, but we told him you were actually really nice. Thank you. Who am I kidding? I'm, like, not even reading. Sitting here just going... Whoo. You want a drink? Sure. Take mine. Oh. Wow, yum. What is that? It's pisco with Coke. Chilean people love drinking it. I'm having one, too. Hey, we're gonna visit my cousins tonight. And you are coming with us. Sure. Good. I really like this. It tastes like candy. And you love candy? Oh, Alicia, your friend is calling me. Shut up, Brink. That's the house? "That's the house?" Why? Are you scared? I don't talk like that, you shit-fuck. Fuck! Agustin, what about this one up above? Yeah, let's try it. You go. Yeah. Push me? Okay, you have me? Yeah. It's open, yes. Okay, okay, higher, higher. Oh, yeah. Hey, Brink, open this door. Welcome to my horny abode. Good job, man. Fuck yeah. Alicia, give me whiskey? Mmm, Alicia germs. Look at this room. Mmm.

You think you're so funny. Well, you're not funny. Oh, you're such a delight, Alicia. You call me a bitch and then you're touching me and... Are you bleeding for real? I don't even know you. I don't know either of you. Hey, hey, hey, relax. Yeah, why don't you go lie down? Oh, my God. She obviously had too much to drink. She was wasted. But that was the mood, that was the mood of the night. And she's the one who got violent. You were fucking acting weird. But I wasn't violent. I wasn't violent, ever. Come on, pick up the phone. Pick up the phone, Sara. Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. Pick up. Pick up the phone. Sara, please pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone. Alicia. Sara, finally! Are you on your way here? Have you taken that exam already? Alicia, you know I'm not here because of school. What's going on, baby? What? Where are you? Sara, you have no idea what has been going on. This dog tried to hump me and then I made Brink bleed. Shit. And it wasn't my fault, I didn't mean to do it. He fucking made me. They killed a bird. Brink killed the bird and he just didn't care. It was like... Shh... Wait. What is it? Oh, my God. It's fucking Barbara. She doesn't, like, let me make any noise here. I can't even breathe. She's fucking crazy. I think she's just mad because I dropped her bag in the water. It's not like I was trying to fist fuck her. Believe me, she would know if I was. You know she's shy and weird. And you know she's alone. Apologize, man. Sara is gonna be pissed. I think she was abused as a child or she's a lesbian or something. You're the lesbian, man. No, no. Miss Barbara, miss Barbara, do you copy? Miss Barbara... What's going on Bernardo? Over. Good morning. Miss Sara just arrived, we are crossing the lake, over. Alicia? Alicia. Alicia. What are you doing? I'm making some toast. Huh. Your cousin's here. She's crossing the lake. Okay. I'm really sorry about all the noise I made last night. What? It won't happen again, okay? Hi, guys. Hey, are you coming with us? Yeah, you're going down? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I'll come. Are you still bleeding? Kind of. No, he's not. Yes, I was, Agustin. You didn't see. Um... Do you want some snacks or something? Yeah, bring some. I'll bring some. We'll be down by the pier. Nice to meet you. Hey beautiful! Hi. Hi. This weather's so shitty. I know. Thank you. Can you help me? Yeah. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, I missed you. I'm sorry, that took so much longer than I thought. How do you like my gringa? Are you fluent in Spanish by now? No. Come on. Hey, where's this house? Right there. Sara. Thanks Bernardo. What? No, nothing. Nothing. I'm just really happy to have somebody to speak English with. Hey, let's go to those rocks. What? You didn't speak English with her? Brink, are you serious? I do speak English. Chill out. I'm just used to speaking Spanish. You're not really though, are you? 'Cause you kind of sound retarded when you do. Here, take a photo of us. Sure. I guess I don't really need to be in it, do I? Come on. Got it? I'm freezing. Can we go inside? Okay, let's go in. Tell me, how do you feel? Alicia, you're not even smiling. Do one where you smile. What the fuck is wrong with them? Did you tell her? No, are you insane? They had such a big fight last night. They had a fight? What happened? Don't worry. So, how was it? It's fine. I'm fine. Did it hurt a lot? I don't want to talk about it. What do you mean? You have to talk about it. It was my baby, too. Shut up, it was not a baby. Don't say that. Hey, Agustin, can I have my food, please? What's up, bitch? What's up, puppy killer? I knew you were traumatized. You're such a gringa. No, I didn't tell anyone. No, chill, Agustin told me. I can't believe you just left it on the side of the road. That's really fucked up. Oh, get over it. Did you get your shit straightened out? Yeah, I did my exam, but I probably failed it or something. So I kinda don't wanna talk about it. Agustin. Mmm-hmm. What's with those rocks you told me about? Hey, Sara. What about it? Will you come to my room with me? Can we just not walk, and take the boat instead? Yeah. So c'mon, tell them! Hey, go get your swimsuits. We're going to the rock. These people are fucking crazy. I'm so sorry I hung up on you last night. Barbara has been making my life impossible. Why? What's she doing? She won't let me move in my room. So, what did you do in Santiago? What? I told you. I had to retake an exam. No, that's not what you said on the phone last night. We didn't talk on the phone last night. Yes, we did, when I told you about Brink. We didn't talk about that. Agustin just told me about the stupid fight you guys had last night. What? Yes, we did. No, we didn't. No? I mean... On the hill. Alicia? I really don't think that this room is that bad. It's kind of depressing and ugly, and there's probably cum stains all over the mattress. Ew. But, I don't know, it's not scary or anything. It's fine. Yeah, well, thanks for staying with me, because you could have stayed with Agustin, right? No, are you crazy? Of course I'm gonna stay with you. I want to keep you company. We're gonna have fun, okay? I promise. You okay? Yeah. Mmm-hmm. You just had a nightmare and you need to brush it off. You'll be fine. Sara, let's go. We're ready. Okay, we're coming. Ooh! It's freezing! Are you gonna be okay in that tiny wetsuit? Do you want my sweater? Oh, no. Thank you. I'm okay. You sure? It's really warm. Alicia, he's being so nice to you. Gold star, Brink. Yeah, I like that he's being nice now. I'm always nice. You want this towel? Sure. Here, you can take my hand. Sara, I'm jumping after you. No, no, no. Sara, you're not jumping. We all are. What, why? I'm gonna sit here and take photos. I don't feel great. Sara... But you should totally jump. Alicia, we're jumping. Yeah! It looks cool doing it. Jump in. Come on, ladies first. After you. Go, Alicia. Sara, he's going first. I'm so scared. Go, bitch. Don't call me that. Okay, sayonara. Oh, my God! Is the bottom far down? No, you can't even see the bottom, go. Okay, well, what if I hit the rocks there? Go! You're fine. Brink, move. Just move, Brink, please. Brink, just fucking move. Jump! Yeah. Go, Alicia! We're going to count, okay? One... Two... No, no, no, wait, wait. Wait, I can't do it. Hand me my towel, please. Wait, wait. It's super safe. Do it! You're gonna love it. Will you just shut up? I just need to concentrate, okay. What does she need to concentrate on? Shut up. Go, Alicia! One! Two... No, no, no, no. We're gonna count again, okay? No, no, no. Come on. Yes, you can. You promised. Do it. Sara. Please come here. Please, I can't. Okay, I'm coming. No, no, are you crazy? Agustin, just let her go. Don't babysit her. Sara. Sara. Are we gonna be here all day? You know it. Oh, shit, it's really fucking high. Agustin, come sit down here. You can take better pictures. Go! Okay, I'm gonna do it. Wait, wait. Sara. Yeah? Why don't we jump together? No, no, no. There's not enough room. Hey, watch out! Be careful. Push her! Okay, wait. Sara! Oh! Baby, are you all right? I'm okay. You're one of us. Oh! It's so fucking cold. I'm gonna do it. Okay. You should have pushed her. Okay. Come on, watch me, okay? One... Two... Three... Okay. Let's count down. Three, two... One. Sara, give me your plate. No, I don't want any more. I'm fine. Don't give me that anorexia bullshit. There's a lot of meat. I have eaten, like, a whole loaf of bread today, seriously. Come on, baby. You have to eat. I'm not hungry. Alicia? Oh, no, thank you. Okay. Hey, Barbara. Um... Do you think maybe we could take Alicia to the doctor tomorrow? 'Cause she's not feeling very well. What's wrong? No, it's nothing. I just haven't really been sleeping at all. That's not true. You always sleep a little. You're sleeping, so you forget you're sleeping. Oh. No, but she got, like, vertigo today. She kept us waiting on this rock for, like, an hour. Remember? "One, two, three..." It's like the fucking mantra in my head now. I'll give you some sleeping pills. You'll feel better tomorrow. Okay. I'll take one of those. I missed you. I missed you, too. You know, I almost had to fuck this prick. Look at that. Am I supposed to take that as a compliment? Pose. Don't be so boring. Agustin, go on the table or something. You guys look weird. What? Take these pills. They're gonna make you relax. Tomorrow, we can ask Bernardo if he has some sleeping pills for you. Okay, this should work. Thanks, Barbara. Oh, fuck. You're not all right. I'm fine. It's okay, it's normal. This is what happens. It will be over soon. We're gonna take it easy tonight, okay? Okay. Or are we having fun tonight? What? It's all black and infinite. Gravity is pulling down every cell in your body. The sounds around you melt together into one golden... Okay, forget it. No, keep going, please. You laugh at everything I say. It's the stupid voice that you do. I can't help it. Alicia, Alicia. Let me get rid of that unpleasant headache of yours. No, I'm gonna be fine. Your sister gave me these. What is this shit? Muscle relaxers? Come on. Just try it. You'll feel a lot better, come on. Don't be so scared of everything. Brink, stay away. Come on. Lay down here. Can you put the music down, please? Just lean back. Relax, close your eyes. I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back. Breathe deeply. You haven't slept in so long. You really want to sleep. Your eyes are tired. Oh, great. Feel the air coming in. And out. Feel your body resting. Your mind is resting. Alicia. No. Are you hypnotized? Yes. Tonight, you will rest. When you go to bed, you will have a great, deep sleep, okay? Yes. You will now touch the tip of your nose. C'mon, man. Okay, are you fucking with me? Yes. Alicia, dance to this song. Okay, dance like a whore. I'm in love with your brother What's his name? I thought I'd come by To see him again When you two danced Oh, what a dance When you two laughed Oh, what a laugh Has he mentioned my... What? God, how many piscos did you guys give her? Whoa. Okay, Alicia, calm down. Look how terrified Brink is. Okay, now give Agustin a blowjob. Oh, Brink, why don't you just do it yourself? Alicia, stop. What the fuck? The fuck? Whoa, whoa... Alicia! What the fuck? Hey, Alicia! Are you serious? Hit yourself in the face. Yes! Bullshit. This is getting stupid. Can we change the music? Now put your face in the fire. No way. Whoa! Alicia, stop. Fuck! What the fuck? What the fuck? Get some water or something. It's okay. Brink, stop fucking filming. Look at my hand! What the fuck, guys? Can you keep quiet? What the fuck, Barbara? She really hurt herself. She tripped and she went in the fire. Oh, my God. Yeah, exactly. Barbara. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Alicia. Put this on. No, no, no, no. I have some medicine. I have some medicine! Wait. Is she all right? No. No offense but she wasn't hypnotized. No way she was going to suck your dick. Impossible. Yeah, but did you notice when she grabbed the coal? Did you see her face? It's called craving attention. She was in a fucking trance. Sara should be playing with her more or something. Hey, do all your girlfriends have crazy relatives or just Sara? I don't really care about her social life, you know? Man, you fascinate me. For real. I'm gonna go check on Sara. Good night, buddy. Okay, Alicia, calm down. Were you drunk? Okay, now give Agustin a blowj. Oh, Brink, why don't you just do it yourself? Sara. What is she doing? Is she all right? Yes, she took a couple of those pills. Thank God. And I'm so tired of you, and hearing you, and drinking all the booze in the house. I am not gona buy morphine. You hear that? I just cannot deal with you guys. It's not funny. And everybody fucking with. And I cannot deal with you guys. It's not funny. Sara? Alicia? Yeah? Yeah. What's going on? Um... My hand hurts and I can't sleep. It's the room, I think. What? The room? Did you take the pills I gave you? No, I haven't yet. Well, take them. Yeah, I will. I will. It's too bad Alicia is not here. But it's probably for the best. Wait, wait. Make up a word. Okay, first word. Alicia! What? That sucks. Alicia's not even a real word. I'm just so glad Alicia's not here. She's such a drag. I wish she'd take those pills more often. What are you doing? What... Please! Stop! Please, no! There's a dog's grave around here. Fucking creeped me out when I was a kid. Oh, here it is. Come on. Your turn. No, I don't want a picture there. Why? 'Cause it's weird. What? Come on. Can we do it now? No, it's going to hurt. Not now. Come on. Let's do it. No, not now. Let's do it the other way, then. What? No! Let's do it the other way. I don't want to. Hey. What's with all the mirrors? Weirdest place I've had sex with Sara? A dog's grave. Come on. I don't want to sing alone. I don't want to sing. I'm not in the mood. No wonder, the fire... I don't know what it's made of. No wonder... it burns me... I don't comprehend it. Uh-oh. Shut up. Hey, Alicia. Are you feeling okay? I'm fine! How's your hand? It's okay. I had a weird moment with a horse here. Talk about what? You know what it's about. Alicia! Yeah? Hey! What the fuck is your problem? The next time you want your pussy eaten out, you can just ask me! I like pussy! What the fuck? Shut up! You want them to know? Really? What are you talking about? Shut up! You came into my room and you rubbed your pussy in my face. Who told you to? Why did you do that? Get away from me! Sara! Hey, baby! This freak grabbed me! He told me I rubbed my pussy in his face! She did! She did! Whatever! She didn't, man. She did! I swear she did! She did not, okay? Okay, she didn't. Fucking asshole! Alicia. I didn't. I didn't! - She did. - Okay. I hate all of you! You have to calm down. I can't sleep. I can't sleep. My phone doesn't even work. Hey, you're okay. You're okay. Alicia? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm just really... I'm really tired. I can't... I can't deal... Alicia? What's happening to me? No. Hey, Alicia. Hey! Alicia, come back! Alicia! Alicia, stop! Alicia! Alicia. Hey. Hey. You okay? You okay? It's okay. Are you guys on drugs? I don't know what's wrong with her. She hasn't been sleeping and burned her hand. Is it bad? I know a doctor... If you need one. Do you have sleeping pills? We don't use those. I have something better... let's go to the house. - Now! - Let's go. Hey, let's go. Let's go to her house. She can help. Come on, baby. She's going to help you. She's going to fix your hand. Come on. Come on, I got you. Come on. You're okay. I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I said out there. Who did this to you? It hurts? Huh? I gave her some herbs, she has to drink them with hot water. You're feeling better? Yeah, she put some herbal ointment on my hand. Hey, I'm making tea. Do you want some? Why are you talking to me in English? This shit's a mess. Let's take you upstairs. No, it's fine. I can go by myself. Okay. This idiot had another fight with Alicia. That girl is freaking me out. Is she possessed, or what the fuck? She's sick. She's, like, mentally ill. She needs to be medicated, or something. No, she just needs some sleep. Maybe when I hypnotized her, like, something got inside her. Barbara, she's like a pathological liar. Last night, she came into my room... No. Brink, shut up, okay? She's not a bad person, you guys. I know her, okay. Then why don't you talk some sense into her? She just needs a doctor. For her hand. Yeah, right. "For her hand." The nearest hospital is five hours away. And you're not taking the truck. Hey, Alicia. Hey, you want me to run you a bath? I'm okay, guys. I promise I'm not sick. No, we know, baby. Let's just make the tea that that woman gave me. I'm okay, really. I believe you. - Just make the tea. - Okay. Let's go upstairs. Alicia? Hey. Were you asleep? I'm sorry. Keep sleeping, baby. That tea really worked. That's good. Go back to sleep. I'm sorry. What are you doing in here? Whatever. I'm looking through Alicia's bag. I found weird shit, Sara. She has all these pills. Do you know what these are for? No. People take medication for all kinds of shit. Why don't you know what she takes it for? Come on. You're being a drama queen. Strange behavior. Just be quiet. We don't want to wake her up. We finally have some peace. Does she get crazy on her period or something? Just be quiet, all right? Why is it "gentle glide for insertion comfort"? What is she so afraid of? Shut up! Is your guy pretending to be happy? Or smiling for real? He's definitely pretending to smile. That's like half of them. Does yours look like she's had really bad plastic surgery? No, it's not Susan. Listen, it says here that hypnosis is used sometimes to treat mental illnesses. But it doesn't trigger it. Does she have any crazy relatives, or something? No. You're just being dramatic. She's feeling much better now. Go. Shouldn't someone be with her in case she wakes up? Barbara. Okay, is yours using their eyebrow muscles? Wait a second. I'm going to go check on her. Bring back some of those pills we found! What pills? It doesn't matter. And some more ice! Agustin. She ate all of these Barbara pills. Like 15! Shit. Agustin, come here. What the fuck is this? Did you see this, man? What the fuck? The smiley face? Fuck. Agustin, stop laughing. This is really starting to freak me out. Did you guys look downstairs? Yes, I looked everywhere. Except for Barbara's room. Yeah, let's keep Barbara out of this, okay? What the fuck! Why is she doing this to me? This is stupid! Why would she come down to the beach? Fuck! I don't know. Do you have a better idea? Yeah, maybe she's at the neighbors' house, or something. Alicia! Don't you call out to her, Brink! You're just going to freak her out even more. Come on, guys. Hurry up! Help me here. Don't fucking do that! Alicia! We'll find her, okay? Bernardo? Alicia! Alicia! Brink? Brink, do you copy? Hell yes, we're at the tennis court! Hey, come on. Let's go look for her on the Fat Hill. Come on. No. No. Agustin, where are you? Over. Guys, dinner is ready. Barbara, we're messing around with the walkie-talkies at Bernardo's... We're having some of Melda's bread. Over and out. One. Two. Three. One. Two. Three. Alicia! Alicia! Hey! Wait, did you hear that? Sara! Alicia! Sara, do you hear that? Sara, I'm here! What? No, it's coming from the water. Alicia! Sara! Okay, guys, watch me. I'm going to do it now. What are you doing? We found her. She's on the rock! Hey. Come back up here. What are you doing? She's on the rock! She's jumping... Alicia, you have to come back up. Please. We're sorry. Just come back up and we'll go home, and everything is going to be fine, okay? Please. We'll go back to California. And you can forget about this place, and it's going to be sunny... Hey, where is she? Agustin! Agustin! Alicia, just walk back slowly, okay? Don't yell at her. I promise I'm going to do it. Okay? No, no, no, no! - One, two... - Don't move! - ...three! - Alicia! Is she fine? Is she fine? Hey, just give her room. Get out of the way, man! There was a sheep and it fell. What is she talking about? Take her clothes off. Bernardo, can we take her to your house? Please. Sara! Sara! Bring my clothes! Agustin, why aren't we taking her home? Melda! Put her on the couch. What's going on? Laurita, go to bed! Sara, where are you? Where are you? It's me, Alicia. It's okay. It's okay. What's going on Agustin? She jumped in the lake. She says she hasn't slept in four days... I don't know what the fuck is wrong with her! Agustin, tell them we need a doctor. Calm down, what's wrong baby? I have some sleeping pills. What pills? Give her two. I'm not giving her those things. What are they giving her? Let me do this. Just sleeping pills, tell her. I don't want it. Easy, easy... Open your mouth. Alicia, don't fight it. This is going to help you relax. Come on, open your mouth. Just give her one! Three is too many! Open your mouth... there you go. Calm down. Swallow. Melda, you said you knew a doctor. - She is not a doctor! - Yes she is! Where you picked me up. Anything is better than here. Wait, where are you going? I'm gonna get the car keys. See you at the dock. Calm down, ok? Hey, come, come. Agustin? Wait! Agustin! I'm going to get the car keys. Wait. She is your friend, ok? She is going to take care of you. It's me. It's your friend. Look at her, she's going to take care of you, ok? I'll be right back. Alicia, it's Sara. It's me. It's okay. You're my friend. Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. You're my friend. Melda? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. It's me. Alicia, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Calm down! What's wrong, baby? What's wrong? Make it stop, Sara! What's wrong? What's wrong? Make it stop. Make it stop. What do you need? What do you need? Please turn on the music! Tell her to shut up! What do you need? You want the music? Agustin, put the music on! Put the fucking music on! Okay. Okay. Folks, here's the story 'bout Minnie the Moocher She was the roughest, toughest frail But Minnie had a heart as big as... Agustin, where the fuck are we? Where the fuck are we? Sara, you're stressing me out! We have to trust Melda! She needs to go to a hospital. No, not now! We can't go to a hospital now. She'll just have to wait. Bernardo gave her sleeping pills. She is not doing good. I think she's a bit crazy, look at her. Relax. Everything is going to be fine. She needs to go to a fucking hospital. We can't go to a hospital now! We're here! She is going to get ready now. Tell your friends that everything is going to be ok. - What is she saying? - Shut up! Sit over there. Ugh! Agustin. Oh, my God. What is that? Baby. I'm sorry. What's wrong? What's wrong? Alicia. What's happening? Spanish. What's she saying? Speak Spanish! What's going on! Can you explain!? She says it's not what it looks like... Her soul is being purified... it will come back to her body and she will regain consciousness... but we have to let her finish. That's a lie! She's not breathing! She's not breathing! Call a doctor, please, a doctor! She's fine! Lower your voice, we are about to finish! What's happening, please? Keep her warm, keep rubbing these herbs under her nose. Alicia? She's going to be ok. I'm done. We have to go. She's dead! She's dead! No! No, she's not. No, she's not. She has done this before, okay? She is alive. Listen, her soul will come back to her body. What the fuck are you talking about? Please come back, baby. Come back. Please come back.
