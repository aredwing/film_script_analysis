It's definitely her. Dago Film Productions Present Konstantin Khabensky The wife on an enemy of the revolution. Where am I going to find a face like that? Elizabeta Boyarskaya Sergei Bezrukov In a film by Andrei Kravchuk ADMIRAL Baltic Sea, Pillau Region. German Waters. 1916 Look sharp. Mines at least seven meters from the surface! - Officers on deck. - At ease! - Well? - It's foggy. No signals from the "Sentry" or the "Hunter" for a while. Try signaling them again. I'll be with the Commander. - May I come in? - Yes. So? Everything's calm, Alexander Vasilievich. - Will you have some tea? - Thank you. That's the Kazan Mother of God, if I'm not mistaken? Sofia Fyodorovna gave it to me, before our marriage. Anna Vasilievna gave me this. As a memento. Look... Beautiful. Beautiful. - Yes? - May I come in? Gentlemen. Your presence on the bridge is needed at once. The Germans, gentlemen. The Germans... Their 210 mm cannons against our 45s. - The "Friedrich Karl". - So much for your "Sentry"... Thank God they're quiet. They've missed us. All hands to battle stations! All to fighting stations! Battle stations! Attention! - Full speed ahead! - Full speed ahead! Helmsman, full speed ahead. Battle! Cut the ropes! Hold her steady! - Why have we slowed down? - Engine room! Why have we slowed down? What's happening? A shell got the pipes in the engine room! - How long to fix it? - Half an hour. You have 15 minutes. In 15 minutes they'll turn us into a sieve. Yes, we're a sitting duck! Why have you stopped firing: Midshipman! Are you alive? Alexander Vasilievich! Should we get the orderlies? Get on the tower. Gurov, you alive? Man the guns! To arms! To arms, I said: Lads! Fire! - Yes! - We got them on the running tower! They're off us now. The Germans' bridge is damaged! Relieve the gunners! Third gunners to the main guns, Good thing we dropped the mines: - What? - I'm sorry. Good that we dropped the mines, if not: Your Excellency, they've repaired the pipes. - The main bridge can't be mended in an hour. - Put on the reserve one. We need to get out of here, while there's still time. Mines, mines Full speed ahead! - Steer course for Pillau! - But that's our minefield! Assemble the officers on the starboard deck. At attention! Gentlemen! There's a German squadron behind us. The "Friedrich Karl" is in front. There's no way back to base. So I see no way out except to lure the Germans onto our mines. Steer course for Pillau. Onto our minefield. Questions? I have a question. One meter from the mines! We won't make it. Our own mines. We're digging our own graves. Calm down, midshipman. We're going onto the mines. Gold help us! Let us pray. Remove your headwear. All powerful God Lord our Saviour Pardon Your faithful servants hear and protect us - Mine at port side! - Stop engines. Ready to reverse. - Mine at port side! Calm down, gentlemen. God have mercy... The Germans are opening sights. Right, now they're all together. Reverse. We've missed the mine. - That's the end... - Goodbye, my friends. They're going to get us. What a shame, gentlemen... Give the order for battle. Stop! Into battle. Slow ahead! Previous course. We're past the minefield. Head home, gentlemen. Champagne for the captain. Podgorsky, come back here. - You've already completed your dare. - No! I promised to stay until the end of the game. Russian naval base. Helsingfors, Finland. What should the dare be? A new uniform! Down a glass of cognac for our victory. That'll be a pleasure for him. But something more challenging! Make him kiss someone. The first person to come through the door. Yes! Passionately. And with feeling. That's your dare, Alexander Vasilievich. - Quite a situation... - Gentlemen, this is not funny. The first through the door will be the sailor I sent for champagne. - Have you no conscience? - That's how it is in war time: Rear Admiral Kolchak kissing a common sailor. Until he comes in, I suggest we continue. What should this dare be? Vladimir, we're waiting. Attention! And here's the sailor. I was just looking for you. I've been summoned to headquarters urgently. Afraid I won't be back tonight. Will you see my wife home? If I don't have the time, as a friend... This is Anna Vasilievevna. My wife. I ask you... What's going on here, gentlemen? Alexander Vasilievich just took on a dare. To kiss the first person to come through the door. That is, your wife. So off you go to your watch. Alexander Vasilievich. We implore you... You ought to honour it! Rules of the game - Like service regulations! Come on Annushka, the dare! You really should obey! Dares are more serious than debts at cards. Ladies and gentlemen. Your attention please! - Slavushka, run off and play. - All right, papa. - Volodya, see what a ship I have! I'm starting to believe in fate, Anna Vasilievna. Today, when I came to Helsingfors, For some reason I was sure - that I would meet you. - Really? Yes, indeed. Sonechka, do you remember when we left Moscow so suddenly? Your father had the bad luck to fall in love. Why are you telling me this? Your neighbour is just too beautiful. Sasha is prone to infatuation. But it doesn't normally last long. Yes, and I wanted to ask, There'll be a ball at the Podorgskys tomorrow. Are you coming? Kirill Fyodorovich, come over here! Attention, ladies and gentlemen. Why on earth do you have to entangle all these balls of yarn? How did the Tsars choose their brides? The brides would untangle a yarn. The Tsar watched through the keyhole. If a girl fidgeted, or lost her temper, that was it. Out you go, lazybones! Because the Tsar's wife must have patience, and self-restraint. That's how my grandmother prepared me to be a bride. Interesting: And why did your grandmother call you a Shelkova cossack? Because I am a Shelkova woman. Our Cossacks married Turkish women. I have Turkish blood too. So, let's drink to the Turks! With pleasure. - Mama, is father an Admiral? - A rear-Admiral. Better if he'd stayed a captain. I like him as a captain better. Rear-Admiral is hard to say. Better if you got some sleep. Go to sleep, my dear. Or you won't go swimming again with father. So what did you find out? It turns out, these Turkish ladies, from the harems Would not give anyone anything! A traveler comes along, and asks for a glass of water. What does the lady of the house reply? "When Ivan comes, he will give it to you, traveler." Slander! Slander and calumny! I for one would never turn you down. I fear, Anna Vasilievna, you would have your hands full. I'm very partial to drinking. I understand you perfectly. Generally speaking, it seems to me that water and war are the only loves in your life. It seems to me you know perfectly well - that's not how it is. Well: It's getting late: We had a nice walk, and now it's time to go our separate ways. Who knows, Anna Vasilievna - whether we'll ever have such a good time as we did today? Thank you: Dear Alexander Vasilievich. Go now: Go. This is the light signal of a sinking ship, Anna Vasilievna. Good night. I was thinking that something had happened: Sasha: Is everything all right between us? Not exactly. Have you fallen in love? Tell me if this is - but... Are you sure this is serious? I don't know: I have no intention of getting in your way, Slavushka, Mother and I will leave. For Petersburg. Sonya, I: You don't need to go anywhere. Everything will be all right. I promise. You are my wife and I am your husband. That's the way it will always be. How is Slavushka? His temperature is nearly normal. Shall I wait for you at lunch? No, I'll be dining at the Assembly. Alexander Vasilievich, congratulations on your new assignment! What a brilliant career! No, I understand well that you can't force someone to love or hate against his or her will. - But we took vows before God - So what? You swore before God, to love me and remain faithful. You understand perfectly well that: Remain faithful - what do you mean? Not go to bed with someone else? If that's what you mean, I haven't been unfaithful to you. God, you're still such a child... I don't understand. What on earth are you doing here? Nikolai Alexandrovich, tell headquarters that the mining operation is complete and there are no losses. We're heading back to base. Thanks for your service, gentlemen. Alexander Vasilievich, please submit my report to Naval Command. - What is this report? - I request to be transferred to another ship. Have we let you down somehow, Sergei Nikolaevich? Rear-Admiral, Sir, a radio message from the coast. From Prince Melikov. To all at sea. Ragotsem Cape, Gulf of Riga, 1916 - We're heading towards a communications buoy. - Stop engines. - Engines stopped. - Drop anchor! Your Excellency. We received a radiogram - "I arrived with the"Glory"." Kolchak. - Go. The cable is connected. The communication is established. Alexander Vasilievich, we're connected with the coast. Man the starboard battle stations. Man the battle stations. Hurry! This is the commander of cruiser the "Glory", Rear-Admiral Kolchak. The situation is critical. The Germans are squeezing us on the right flank. I will coordinateayour firing operation myself. Grid thirty. Coordinates: Three thousand five hundred. Two thousand two hundred. Battle stations! Man the guns! Sight eighteen. Deflection forty three. Fire! Twenty more to the left. Three higher... The Germans are turning their guns!! AHello! Hello! Hello!? I can't hear you. Man the guns! In place! The Germans have opened fire on us. - So? - We're a sitting duck now - We need to head out to sea. - Then how do I adjust the line of fire?! We're staying in place. Check the communication! Are you wounded? Let me help: This is not the time or place, Sergei Nikolaevich: But as a military officer you surprised me with your report. To leave your comrades with whom you have served so long: Given the situation that has arisen between the two of us. A personal situation What situation? The only situation now is war - fighting the enemy and doing your duty to the homeland. Yes! Rear-Admiral Kolchak. What are your new firing coordinates? Ten to the left and five higher! Open fire! Mates! Attack! Hurray! Stop! Stop! Here is a letter in Morse code. I did my best with a textbook at home. Thank you. But today is the last time we shall see each other. We can't meet again. What happened? Did we do something wrong:? Anna Vasilievna: We didn't even dance. Why Alexander Vasilievich? Because I love you. Farewell! Alexander Vasilievich. Give me the letter. My darling Annushka! You're all wet. Be careful or you'll fall ill. - I'm very tired. Sure Annushka, I: Mogilev, 1916 the Emperor's General Headquarters The Emperor will see you here in the park. - I wish you health, Your Majesty. - Greetings. I have been told of your bravery. Of the courage you showed on the Baltic Sea. I acted according to the call of duty, Your Majesty. I invited you here to inform you of my decision. You have been assigned the rank of Vice-Admiral, and become the Commander-in-Chief of the Black Sea fleet. Thank you for your trust, Your Majesty. Take this, and may the icon of the long-suffering Job give you strength. Thank you. I wish you good luck! Allow me to take my leave, Your Majesty. Godspeed, admiral. "I must know that you're alive". Driver! To the train station on the double! Faster, please... Gentlemen. Alexander Vasilievich needs protection from the sun! - It's a resort area. - There's more sun in Sevastopol... When are you going there, Sophia Fyodorovna? Tea, gentlemen. This is your fleet! Yesterday I was walking by Mikhailovsky castle when I heard children arguing: "Mine, give it me", "No"... Then all of a sudden it became crystal clear to me "Everything will come in due time. It already has come". There is no more mine or yours. Every morning I open my eyes and smile... I'm alive... I am waiting... This is a reward, not a punishment. Because against all the laws of physics you give, the more you give the more you receive. Just imagine, I can feel in the palms of my hand a big and unbelievably shiny ball. This is Grace. A gift... Happiness... That's the way it is. Don't laugh. I know. I stand on the edge of a vast unseen world. And although we see the future unclearly, as the Apostle said: "Through a glass darkly... And now abideth faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love". Alexander Vasilievich, I heard that you will be in Petrograd... How soon? March or April? For some reason it seems to me that it won't be long. May I come in? Your Excellency, a wireless message just came in. On March 2nd the Emperor Nicholas the Second abdicated the throne. Power is with the Provisional Government... The monarchy has fallen. A Provisional Government... What does that mean? I don't think it bodes at all well for Russia. I think you're right. Anna Vasilievna, unfortunately... KRONSTADT, 1917 The revolution has eclipsed our future. The darkness is moving in. - Where are you taking us? - Wherever... Gentlemen, are we just a herd of animals? - We should do something! - Hands off, sailor! Please, obey. It's treason. - Listen to my command. - My God! We're at war. Come to your senses! What are you doing? - Sort out the Admiral. - Fear the Lord. Gentlemen! Save yourselves, that's an order! - Run! - Shoot them... Kolya! May God be with you! SEVASTOPOL Annushka, good you're home. Pack your bags. - What happened, Serezha? - Admiral Nepenin has been killed! - How did he die? - I said he was killed! He was clubbed with rifle butts and stabbed with bayonets. Brutes! Serezha, I can't understand what's happening. God! What on earth is happening? Serezhenka, calm down, explain. Podgursky has also been killed. He died in my arms. Out of the way! - What's the matter? - The first order... of the Petrograd Soviet is for all officers to hand over weapons. To prevent a counter-revolutionary conspiracy. Turn in your weapon, Admiral. - We're leaving for Petrograd... - Why are we leaving? - I was able to take some leave... - Hold on now! What are you waiting for? Pack your bags... Admiral, follow this order immediately. - Get out of here! - Listen here, Admiral... Get out! All right men, we'll figure this out on deck. Officer of the watch, tell everyone to line up on deck. Wait, Serezha, how can I... how can I go... All letters come to this address. I'm waiting... At least close your suitcase? Anya. Anya, Anechka, please my dear. I'm begging you. The boat leaves in half an hour. We're finished if we don't make it on time. Arms! As you were! Attention! Order revoked! Fall in! Who are you obeying? - You afraid, lads! - Fall in! Quick. Officers, gentlemen. - Weapons up. - I'm sorry! At ease. To avoid bloodshed, I order the officers to turn over their weapons. Admiral, sir, your weapon... Sir. PETROGRAD (ST. PETERSBURG) To the meeting? Kerensky will be there himself. Come with us, lady... Let's go! You weren't home today. I got the mail and there is a letter for you. From Sevastopol. It's strange that mail still arrives. I'm feeling tired today. In three days I'll be in Petrograd. Seeing you is all I'm dreaming of. SEVASTOPOL Hearing your voice. - Kerensky has summoned me. - It's dangerous in Petrograd... the sailors and workers have rebelled. Admiral Nepenin was stabbed to death with a bayonet. - Can I see you to the station? - Sonya, I... Rostislav is waiting for you. Go to him. - Will you come back? - Of course. What silly thoughts. Petrograd Kerensky wants to offer you the post of war minister... Let's see. I wish he would see me on time. But he is late. Today... at the Mikhailovsky Castle... Today... I can see we have a different view of the war... By condoning anarchy you have broken up the army - and destroyed the Russian navy. - Don't forget, Admiral... Unless I have authority to impose strict order your proposals are unacceptable to me. Former procedures in the army are not acceptable to us. I was the first to swear allegiance and I'll be the first to leave the Navy. In this way, I will make a public statement that the current state of affairs is ruinous for Russia. I accept your resignation. I am honoured. You should be arrested for your counter-revolutionary leanings. But given your merits, I offer you to go to America. I'm giving you the chance to continue the war against Germany. Are you exiling me from Russia? The Americans need an expert who can conduct a landing and seize Constantinople. My family is still in Sevastopol. I'll take care of them. I'll ask the allies to have them brought to you overseas. Thank you. Dear... My darling, Anna Vasilievna. You are my happiness; I can't live without you... What? Their times are over! I'm leaving Russia. Why? What tired eyes you have. I love you. And I always will. Forgive me. Farewell, Alexander Vasilievich. I know that you are alive. SEVASTOPOL Is it ready? At least let me pray. You can pray if you want to. Listen, bring the rope. Let's go while he draws the Sailors away! Stop! Quick, let's go... we can't wait for him here. A Stop! Mrs. Kolchak! Open the door, Mrs. Kolchak! Document check! Break it down! Break the windows! It's time, the British ship sets sail in an hour. TRANS-SIBERIA RAILWAY AUTUMN 1918 I think I'm doing it better. Take your place. What a good shot! Let's drink to our wishes. Even the ones that don't come true? Does that make them any less wishes. - Excuse me, Madam. - Yes, of course. - Mikhail Ivanovich. - Anna Vasilievna! - My God! - What a surprise! I haven't seen you for a year... What brings you here? Sergei Nikolaevich has been sent to the Far East. He's on a mission to disarm the Pacific fleet. Sergei Nikolaevich? ...So he's in power now? - A red commissar. - I have no right to judge him. At a time like this. It's the same time for everyone. - Where are you going? - To Omsk. But the Soviets are in power there too? No. Kolchak is there. But I thought Alexander Vasilievich was abroad? Kerensky did send him abroad: But after the Bolshevik coup he returned to Russia to fight the Bolsheviks. I'm sorry, Anna Vasilievna, I must go. Goodbye. Serezha: Aha... yes... yes, Anya! What is it? Kolchak is in Omsk gathering an army. Anya, if this is a rebuke, you know I agreed to collaborate with the authorities because they allowed us to go far away from this fratricidal madness... To Japan, China... It's all for your sake, Anechka. I don't blame you for anything. But I love Alexander Vasilievich, Serezha. And now I need to be with him... I realize that these are harsh words, but I have never stopped loving him. I see! ...Stop, stop... Let me help. So there it is. A time of wars and revolutions. Anything goes. The time has nothing to do with it. When I fell asleep I was your husband. I wake up and I am no longer your husband: I know it's hard for you but you've got to be strong. You'll forget me before long. Let me be the one to decide that. Siberia, Eastern Front. November 1918 I pledge and swear before Almighty God, His Holy Gospel and the Life-Giving Cross: To be faithful and ever true. To the Russian state as my Homeland. I pledge and swear to serve it as the Supreme Ruler of Russia, without regard for my life, family ties or friendship, enmity, or gain, and mindful only of the revival and success of the Russian state. Hereby I make the sign of the cross, and kiss the words and Cross of my Saviour. Amen. OMSK. Hello, my lady! Who are you looking for? You, I think. How can I help you? I'm the one who would like to help you. My dear sweet Alexander Vasilievich, I have realized that I simply can no longer wait! Do you remember how I dreamed to be on the deck of your ship? Just to see you. You would not even notice me, I would not disturb you; all I need is to stand nearby: And now it seems that I will experience this happiness. Take joy in your victories. Our troops are already moving towards the Volga. And God willing, we will all see Moscow soon. And I will know that I have played a small part in all of this. I congratulate you, General, on a successful operation. Thank you... Not only my achievement, but the entire army... Nothing can lift spirits of the soldiers as an attack. I heard from the Allies that they're about to recognize your government as the only legitimate one in Russia... Whatever laws we pass we'll still be shot, if we lose this war. My heart swells with pride for you and all who are fighting beside you for the revival of Russia... We need to build on our success and continue the offensive in all directions. Your goal is to reach Ufa. Good luck, general. Godspeed! More than a year has gone by since the last time we met. Your Excellency? General Janin from the Allies has arrived. After all the changes we've been through I was wondering how you would... I... I'm afraid even to think about this. Most of all I'm afraid to place you in an awkward situation because of my unexpected arrival. General Janin, our allies France and Britain Have given you the rank of Commander. And you are the Supreme Commander of Russia. Put it over here, bring the hot water! A foreigner cannot command the Russian army. Do you inviting me to command the Czech prisoners of war who guard the railway? It is a crucial object. From now, you are commander of the allied Czech forces. I thank you, Admiral. I thank you, General Janin. All I need to know is that you are in the world. That nothing bad has happened to you. To see you sometimes, even from afar. If only you knew how I am tempted to come and see you so we could talk. My love for you is even greater than before. I've been writing this letter to you for so many days and I still cannot bring myself to send it. Your Excellency! I welcome you to our city! Accept this bread and salt as our hospitality. The geese saved Rome and you have saved our city. Here you are, your Excellency... It's a good thing it's not a cow, gentlemen! Write it down as a gift. Officers and soldiers of the Russian army! Ladies and gentlemen! Perm, Ekaterinburg and Elabuga have been taken. General Kapel recently took Ufa in battle. We're only about 100 kilometers away from Denikin's armies. The Reds have broken the front in three places. The First and the Second armies have been defeated. Together with them we shall move on Moscow!.. Go. As the Apostle Paul said: "For now we see through a glass darkly... And now abideth faith, hope and love... But the greatest of these is love." May God help us! You are starting to recover. God is merciful. There are rumours that there will be evacuation. Where are we going to load them? Anna Vasilievna, You should speak with him: Well, about the rail wagons. - Are the Reds so close? - Haven't you heard the cannons? There are not enough cars for the wounded. Kolchak can't think about them. You should have reminded him. Vera, it's impossible. Besides, we were not that close. Who will listen to me? But you are a lady. They will listen to you and kiss your hand. I don't know how to act as a petitioner. Come on, my dear, it would be easy for you. Ladies, they brought some wounded officers. From our side. Let's go. There are pockets of resistance even in the far rear. It's worse at the front, a not to mention the constant lack of ammunition and provisions. The Reds have crossed the Tobol River. Omsk can never surrender. Losing Omsk means losing the army. We can't risk the army. Gentlemen! There can only be one decision: To fight with our last force to save Omsk. Yes. Of course. I swear before God! I am with you! Kappel's army is still trying to keep back the Bolsheviks, but to leave the front to protect Omsk would spell disaster! Giving up Omsk - That would be the disaster! Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm from the front, so no time to make myself more presentable. - May I come in? - Yes. Bad news, gentlemen. Treason. The second Ukrainian regiment has defected and abandoned the central front. The Reds are moving towards Omsk. They will be here in another week or two. That's how it is, gentlemen. It's your decision, Sir Supreme Ruler. I declare Irkutsk to be the seat of power. I order the evacuation from Omsk to begin. We will make this sacrifice to save the army. To carry on our struggle against the Bolsheviks. To carry on our struggle against the Bolsheviks. OMSK, NOVEMBER 1919 I'm not letting you through! Move aside! The Prime Minister's office will be in carriage B. Viktor Nikolaevich, tell me how transportation of the wounded proceeding... This is where the Executive Office will be located. And the last compartment will be used for telegraph calls. Alexander Vasilievich. Could you come here for a minute? What? I think I just saw Anna Vasilievna here. Alexander Vasilievich, the medical cars are completely full. No room even for minor injuries. - Open the carriage. - I can't. - Make room in the second car. - The merchants are in there: - They paid. - Did you hear my order? - It's up to you... - Carry the wounded. Would you like them to lie in the snow?! - Do as you... They're frozen. - Carriage full. Dear Anna Vasilievna: Once I made an unforgivable mistake in parting from you. I never want to make the same mistake again. I... Will you come along with me? In the same carriage. I'm not sure if you'll agree to remain always by my side from now on. Morning and evening. Otherwise I... I can't go on without you... My sweet dearest Anna Vasilievna! No room! Paris, France, 1919 "How long will the Supreme Ruler of Russia continue to retreat?" "The Ruler of Russia abandoned Omsk. Has Kolchak lost the war to the Bolsheviks?" TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILROAD Merry Christmas. Where is your ring, Anna Vasilievna? I haven't worn it for ages - and you didn't notice. Anna Vasilievna, there is something I need to tell you. Today I wrote a letter to Sophia Federovna. I asked her for a divorce. I don't know how much time the Lord has left me, but I want to be honest with her until the end: Tell me... will you be my wife? Alexander Vasilievich... We're together at last. Isn't that enough? Anna Vasilievna, I asked you a very clear question. Why do you remain silent? We haven't even said our Chirstmas toast. What happened? NIZHNEUDINSK STATION. - Mama, look it's the Czechs! - Step back! It's the "Allies"! Merry Christmas. Greetings, Anna Vasilievna - Why have we stopped again? - The Czechs have delayed us. The bastards are moving their 20,000 cars stuffed full ofjunk and then perhaps it will be our turn. They are completely brazen! Convoy - take your weapons! Stand aside! Major! Stopping the Ruler's train is an act of treason... The Admiral told the convoy to take up arms. It's an order from General Janin... General Janin must obey the orders of Admiral Kolchak. He is the Supreme Ruler of Russia. Mr. Prime Minister. There is an uprising in Irkutsk. You have nowhere to go. Please let me come in. Kappel's army is moving in behind us and we are prepared to quell any resistance. - May I come in? - Certainly. There is a telegram from Kappel... from Kulomzino. He bypassed Kulomzino and is heading this way. Quick! Put me through to General Kappel! Your army must reach Irkutsk at all costs! The city is rebelling. I am heading there now. Discharge your duty honorably! Thank you! My horse! Why have they stopped firing? Your Excellency, we're out of ammunition. - Run to Lozhkin and get some! - None there either! Headquarters... answer! Lieutenant-General Voytsekhovsky with an advance detachment... We're being squeezed on the left flank. - And we are out of ammunition. - You may go. - What about communications? - We can't... Line's cut. Keep trying! - Answer, headquarters... - Headquarters here. Vladimir, how did you get here? It's under fire. Why have you ceased the offensive? What offensive? We haven't got a single bullet left. I received Kolchak's telegram. There's a rebellion in Irkutsk. We must free the city. We'll get through to the Admiral Only we can save the city. We need to attack. - The rest of the army is on the way? - We'll be dead by the time they come here. Prepare for battle. We have no other option. Time is running out. Sergei Nikolaevich, tell the men to fall in. Officers and soldiers! Lads... We have nowhere to get ammunition. To hell with them! God is with us! And with God and prayer we have always defeated the enemy and we will go on doing so! All is in God's hands. If we are destined to die we will go down with honour! We will go down with honour! It's do or die now! To faith, to the homeland, Bayonets ahead - forward march! Attach bayonets! Vladimir Oskarovich, you can't. You're leading the army. Where are the musicians?! Army Music! Quickly! Music, I said! Musicians - forward, march! Close formation! Into fire! Lads - advance! Music! Forward! Hooray! Eh, you got a woman... Those bastards! Get back! Are we going to lay the Reds by the Whites? Together. We are all God's people. God didn't paint them in different colours. IRKUTSK, GENERAL JANIN'S CONTROL HEADQUARTERS - Greetings! - I understand that you cannot suppress the riot in Irkutsk - General Janin! - The situation is difficult. You must ensure that my convoy reaches Irkutsk. The Czechs reject all their obligations as Allies. They have declared neutrality and are evacuating. They are tired and angry. Admiral, the railway has already been taken by partisans. My garrison is blockaded there, I have to go! The Reds won't touch you, if you go to Irkutsk with the Czechs. The outcome of the war depends on how soon I will be in Irkutsk. You must believe me. I give you the word of an officer. I guarantee your safety. Only the convoy officers will accompany me to Irkutsk. All other ranks will remain with their convoy in Nizhneudinsk. Nizhneudinsk train station. Mr. Udintsov, it's time to go. Yes, officers, please enter the carriage. Admiral, I would ask you not to leave the car at stations and not to stand by the windows. Tell nobody about your whereabouts. - This is like being under arrest: - No, sir Admiral. The workers are rebelling. They demand to hand you over. TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILROAD. I wish we could just move on and on... You know, Anna Vasilievna, I never like traveling by train. There really are Reds at the stations. It's like sailing through a minefield. Like when you were off the coast of Pillau? Sergei Nikolaevich told me all about it. I just wish we could meet with Kappel now. The Czechs have disarmed our garrison in Irkutsk. So what can the Admiral accomplish now? Kappel has 2,000 kilometers behind him. In minus 40 weather. You know, he is a man of light. I will definitely introduce you to him in Irkutsk. I would be glad to meet him, Alexander Vasilievich. A TAIGA, BANK OF THE RIVER KAN. You're Excellency, we've veered Cut across the river. Time's up! Move on... Don't spread out! Pick up the pace. - Vladimir Oskarovich! - Get back! It's melting. Help the commander, straightaway! Check the ice further up stream! Get back! We have to cross it anyway.
