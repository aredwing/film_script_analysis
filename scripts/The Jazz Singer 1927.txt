Wonderful pals are always hard to find Some folks have one Some folks have none And I was alone for years But fate was kind And in the end Sent me a friend Although he's not much higher Than my knee Still, he's the greatest thing on earth To me Dirty hands, dirty face Leads the neighbors a chase But his smile is as cute as can be Making noise, breaking toys Always fighting the boys But his eyes, they're a vision To see And when my work is done Coming home with the setting sun From the gate he'll start to run And then I'll kiss my boy Dirty hands, dirty face Little devil, that's what they say But to me He's an angel of joy Dirty hands, dirty face Leads the neighbors a chase But his smile, his little smile Is as cute as can be Making noise, breaking toys Always fighting the boys But his eyes, they're his mother's And they're a vision to see And when my work is done Coming home with the setting sun From the gate he'll start to run And then, oh I'll... I'll kiss my boy Dirty hands, dirty face Little devil, that's what they say But to me He's an angel of joy Wait a minute, wait a minute. You ain't heard nothing yet. Wait a minute, I tell you. You ain't heard nothing. You wanna hear, "Toot, Toot, Tootsie!"? All right. Hold on, hold on. Lou, play "Toot, Toot, Tootsie!" Three choruses, you understand? In the third chorus, I whistle. Give it to them hard and heavy. Go right ahead. Toot, toot, Tootsie, goodbye Toot, toot, Tootsie, don't cry The little choo-choo train That takes me away from you You don't know Just how sad it makes me Kiss me, Tootsie, and then Do it over again Watch for the mail I'll never fail If you don't get a letter Then you'll know I'm in jail, hey, hey Don't cry, Tootsie, don't cry Kiss me, Tootsie, goodbye Get hot. Goodbye, Tootsie, goodbye Goodbye, Tootsie, don't cry The little choo-choo train That takes me away from you You don't know Just how sad it makes me Kiss me, Tootsie, and then, hey, hey I'll do it over again Watch for the mail I'll never fail If you don't get a letter Then you'll know I'm in jail Don't cry, Tootsie, don't cry Goodbye, Tootsie, goodbye Blue skies smilin' at me Nothin' but blue skies do I see Bluebirds singin' a song Nothin' but little bluebirds all day long I never saw the sun shinin' so bright Never saw things goin' so right Noticing the days hurrying by When you're in love, oh, don't it fly? Blue days, days, days All of them gone Nothin' but blue skies from now on - Did you like that, Mama? - Yes. I'm glad of it. I rather please you... ...than anybody I know of. Oh, darling, will you give me something? - What? - You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut them for little Jakie. I'm gonna steal something. Oh, Jakie. I'll give it back to you someday too. You see if I don't. Mama, darling... ...if I'm a success in this show... ...well, we're gonna move from here. - Oh, no. Oh, yes. We're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of green grass up there and people you know. The Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, the Goldbergs. A whole lot of "bergs," I don't know them all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice, black silk dress, Mama. Mrs. Freedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you. - Oh, no. No. - Yes, she will. You'll see if she isn't. I'm gonna get you a pink dress that will go with your brown eyes. What do you mean, no? Who is telling you? What do you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink. And darling, oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island. - Yeah? - Yes. We're gonna ride in Shoot-the-Chutes. - Do you know the dark mill? - Yes? - You ever been to dark mill? - I wouldn't. With me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You'll see if I don't. Now, Mama. Mama, stop now. You're getting kittenish. Mama, listen. I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now, get this. Blue skies smilin' at me, me, me, me Nothin' but little blue skies do I see Bluebirds singin' a song Nothin' but little bluebirds all day long You like that slapping business? Never saw the sun shinin' so bright Never saw things goin' so right Noticing the days hurryin' by When you're in love, oh, don't they fly? Blue days, all of them gone - Stop. - Nothin' but... Mother, I'm sorry I wandered away Breaking your heart as I did Now that I'm grown up I've come back to say Things that I felt as a kid Dear Mother of mine When friends all doubt me I still have you Somehow you're just the same Mother divine With your arms around me I know I'm not to blame When skies are sunny Ain't it funny? That's when my pals All haunt me When things go wrong And they don't want me Mother, I still Have you Mother of mine When friends all doubt me I still have you Somehow you're just the same Mother divine With your arms about me I know I'm not to blame Gee, ain't it funny When skies are sunny That's when my pals They haunt me And when things go wrong And they don't want me Mother I still have You Mammy Mammy The sun shines east The sun shines west But I know where the sun shines best Mammy Mammy My heartstrings are tangled around Alabamy. L... I'm comin' Sorry I made you wait l...
