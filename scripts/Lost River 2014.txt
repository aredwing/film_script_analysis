I'm gonna get the monster, I promise. There we go. Hey. Got it. - You got it? - Yeah. - Think you'll ever come back? - Know what? Nobody's coming back. It's over with. Gotta get outta here. You gotta get outta here, too. Yeah, well, as soon as I get my car fixed, I'm out of here. I don't wanna leave, but I wanna live. Look at this. I had a wonderful childhood. So far, I had a wonderful life. Just... just sad what happened. Just sad what happened. See, I used to always sing, "didn't I blow your mind this time?" - How does that go like? - Didn't I blow your mind this time? Didn't I... Came out in '69. And, like, "Betcha by golly wow." I love you, and I'll never forget you. Be careful. Get out of here while you can. - Where's Larry? - He's out in the yard. It's number one. Look at that. - Yeah, that's number two. - Yeah, that's number one, though. Yeah, but it's mixed, so it's number two. - Yeah, well, I'll separate it. - We'll give you a good price. Well, that's number-one copper, so I better get a good price. I put a sign up here that says, "Don't let me see your fucking face near my motherfucking copper!" This is my fucking copper! I own this fucking copper! I own this city! I own this copper! This is my fucking copper! I put a sign up here that says, "don't let me see your motherfucking face around here again!" This is my country! This is my city! I own this fucking city! I put a sign up here that says, "don't let me see your motherfucking face around here again!" Welcome to Bullytown! Hey. I'm Dave. - Where's Carl? - Carl? He's moved on. I've been brought in to consolidate some of these branches. So... How can I help? Carl talked me into this loan. He told me that... he could get me into my grandmother's house for nothing and that I shouldn't be paying someone else's mortgage, and he didn't explain it to me, and I never understood it. And then a couple years later, the rates change entirely, and I... he didn't explain. Can I just... can I just cut across you for a moment, there? Listen, I am all ears, but you're gonna have to talk up a little bit, 'cause I am very deaf. This happens to be my good ear, but all I heard then was... So, just... whatever it was you just said, please, just a little louder. I can't quite hear it. I don't think I ever should have qualified for that loan, and Carl talked me into that loan. Can I ask your name? - Billy. - Okay, Billy. We are in the middle of a very tight fiscal knot, and it's squeezing, and you are right in the middle of it. Now, you could pay your 3 months. You can walk away with some money. You could pay your three months and then pay more and more, and yeah, you could keep the house... - So I can? - ...if that's really what you wanna do. Yeah, but what can you do? What sort of work do you do? Well, that doesn't sound promising. I mean, how do you plan to... Do you have a plan? See... I have been to... 6 Lost Rivers in the last few years, and I hear the same story from folks like you. Now, I don't know Carl very well. I only met him for a moment, and then I fired him. But in those precious few moments, you know, he didn't strike me as an evil financial genius bent on destroying the American dream one single mom at a time, okay? Okay, but I'm actually not interested in the buyout. I'd like to just pay the 3 months and keep the house and stay in the house. Do you mind if I ask why? Because I have 2 boys, and that is our home, and... and I grew up in that home, and that is our home. Look, I can make a note for you, right? I can write a fucking novel. But at the end of the day, you're gonna have... - ...to come up with some of this. - Okay. Now, I don't know what you can do, but you want to have a think about that very seriously... what you can do, what you're willing to do. And you're a very beautiful lady, and I don't care what you do. I'm not what I do. It's not who I am. Everyone's gotta do the shimmy-shimmy-ya. You know, I got my little hustle. It's not who I fucking am. Believe me. But if I were you, I'd make the payments, walk away with the money, because I'm telling you, the wolves, if they're not already at your door, they're gonna be there very fucking soon. Pardon my French. - What's this? - It's a job. - And where is that? - Well, it's... Closer than somewhere over the rainbow. Let's put it that way. I think you'll like it. Where were you today? I called you so many times. Here. Were you out stripping houses? No. Where were you? I was at the bank. Why'd you have to go to the bank? Are we behind? No, Bones, we're fine. Please stop worrying about it. Love you. Whisper That you want me And I'll love you always Truly, you will be mine For eternity Whisper That you love me That you'll never leave me Be mine For always I'll be yours forever Truly, you will be mine You will be my baby - ...that this was going to happen. - I was not notified! Do you think I look notified?! You can't just come in here and start knocking down houses! - This neighborhood... - I live right there! I have kids! Mommy! Mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy! Go inside, Franky, okay? We're not all paid up, are we? No. How much? 3 months. So, what are we gonna do? I've got it figured out. I got offered a job. What kind of job? I don't know. Dave told me about it. Who the fuck is Dave? Dave's the bank manager. Jesus Christ. I can't fucking do anything right! Hey! Bones! Hey! You better run your fuckin' ass! Dave? I'm calling about that job. Larry, can you weigh my bag? Man, you can't come in here anymore. - Look at this stuff. It's number one, okay? - Yeah, that's a good number one. - There's about $100 worth in the bag! - I don't care. - Why? - Things ain't like it used to be, man. Bully running everything now. You're a dead motherfucker. You know he caught that boy up there on St. Mary's... that little Chinese boy? Cut his goddamn lips off with a pair of scissors. You think that motherfucker look funny in the beginning? You ought to see him now, Bones. No more copper. No more you, Bones. What I don't understand... all this shit for some goddamn car parts! It's not about the car parts this time, okay? I need the money. They're gonna take the house. It's the last time, I promise you. I'll never come back. I don't wanna say this to you, but that might be a blessing in disguise. So maybe you ought to take that blessing, head South, don't stop until you see Palm Trees. 'Cause Bully ain't no forgivin' person, man. Head South, man. You can't even see the woods from the trees, motherfucker. The only way to live is like a bull... to the wind, you know. When you put a bull to the wind, you know, there's something that happens with his eyes and his horns, and it's like Bully town. You got to remember, man, blood is important to all of us, you know? You can't cheat death. You can't cheat life. You can't cheat anything, really. You never wanna let people down. You let him go? Hey! Can I watch your TV? - Yeah. - Okay, thanks. I dreamed I was a knight. With my armor and my horse, I went out to fight a dragon. Try to buy some chops and he could really cook your steak, bud. Let me tell you, boy. He was a mean dragon from the very word of go. I found a road that goes underwater. Where? Behind the old zoo. Must go down to that town. What town? You know, the town at the bottom of the reservoir. - That's crazy. What does that mean? - It's not really that crazy. They flooded a bunch of towns when they dammed the river. That's why they call this Lost River. I have a movie about it. - A movie? - Yeah. Like an educational film or something. You really never heard about it? No. My grandmother used to live there. She hasn't been the same ever since. No one has. As soon as the last town was drowned... an evil spell was cast on Lost River. - Think you're making it up. - I'm not. That's why this whole place feels like it's underwater, too. It's true. Makes sense... everything that's going on around here. It's got to be for some reason. The old way... it works. - Do you want some paper towel? - Yeah, please. - Sorry for that. - I have it for that very reason. It's not the 5-star service, but... I'm a mother. I can pull anything out of this bag. Well, I'm not your child. You might be very tired, so you can make yourself comfortable, and I'll let you to sleep. I just wake you up when we arrive. Please, feel like home, and take this moment of rest. We're here. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this is the moment you've all been itching for. Coming to our stage is a lady of letters, a woman not of substance, but above-stance. The 8th, 9th, and 10th wonders of the world. Now, you may recognize her from "sadissmo," "burn, baby, burn," "the violent ones," or... or her stage production, "the beautiful, the bloody, and the bare." Please put your hands together for the delightful, the delicious, and the de-lovely, pretty miss Kitty Cat! Cuando la tarde languidece renacen las sombras Y en la quietud los cafetales vuelven a sentir Esta triston cancion de amor de la vieja molienda En el letargo de la noche parece gemir Cuando la tarde languidece renacen las sombras I got some fans tonight. I got some fans. Okay. ...cafetales vuelven a sentir Esta triston cancion de amor de la vieja molienda En el letargo de la noche parece gemir Una pena de amor, una tristeza Lleva el zambo Manuel en su amargura Pasa incansable la noche moliendo cafe Oh, my gosh! Yeah! Rise, rise, rise! And pay respects to the goddess of Gore! Maybe, maybe, yes. Now I feel like a goddess. So, I'm okay with it. Plus, I love my boobs. They're, like, my fave. Cat? Cat, Billy's here to see you. - Who's Billy? - It's a Dave situation. Oh, shit, I knew it. - Hi. Have a seat. - Okay. You like that stuff... blood, guts, torture? Is that what you're into? - Fanny. - Yeah. You chipped my tooth. You chipped my tooth. Oh, sorry, Cat. Billy, what's your act? - I don't have an act. - You don't have an act? - You juggle? - No. - Tap dance? - No. Ever pull a rabbit out of your hat? No. - How's your scream? - My scream? Yeah. Like, for bloody murder. I mean, a scream, you know... I'm so sorry I'm late, grandma. Grandma? Grandma? Hey. Hi, grandma. Sorry, grandma. There he is. You got to go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Up here. Engineers planned this out to the last detail. And look at it go! Filling the valley up like a sink from a faucet. Sure, we might be losing our famous prehistoric theme park, - but we're gaining a brand-new reservoir. - A reser-what? It's a lake, made right where you need it. So that's how we all work together to help our town grow. And just because you may need to leave your house and all its old bricks and boards and nails... that's not a bad thing. You're in a brand-new home with your family, because...? - A family makes a home. - You said it, Bobby. A family makes a home. That's her. That's her in the movie. Is that your grandfather? Yeah. He died during the construction of the dam. She hasn't spoken ever since. Now you believe me about the spell? No. Well, you know, the only way to break it is to bring a piece to the surface. They like burning houses here. It is like a game. You know, in my country, in my place, when you heard about America, everybody say, "there's so much money there," and... "you're gonna have a big car, big house, and a swimming pool," and... and, "you're gonna catch the money on the floor and just have to take it and pick it up." And finally it's different. But you realize when you arrive here, it's different. So, everybody's looking for a better life somewhere. It's like that. And maybe we'll find some... - one day. - Yeah. Where you're working doesn't seem friendly. Will you be okay? I'll be fine. How about you? I'm fine. And tomorrow morning, when you wake up to find blood on your pillow, you'll wonder if it was all just a dream. But you'll know exactly where you were when you get your credit-card bill. I don't really know what it is, but I like it. Well, it's a place for people to get wild for the night. Fuck being polite. It's something I do every time I come to one of these towns that's imploding. I set up one of these clubs. People come here. They have a good time. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Get me a band-aid. I need a band-aid to the stage. I'm gonna have Cat, show you around after her act. Thank you so much. You can make some good bread doing the shows, but down here is where you get it buttered. - What are they called? - Shells. You just get in there, and then what? That's it. All you have to do is be in there. They just wanna be able to let out their frustrations and not worry about hurting anyone. Is it dangerous? If the door's locked, you're fine. Yeah. Door's locked, you're good. How much does it pay? It pays the rent. - Do you get a commission? - Off this? Yeah. Does that make you feel uncomfortable? Good night. Hey. Put on something fancy. We're going out on the town. - What are you doing? - I'm going out. You have to watch Franky. Can you watch him? I got to go to work! Please? Why would you steal something from Bully? Why would you do something that stupid? 'Cause it was mine. - You can't steal from a guy like that. - Fuck, he stole from me. I mean... Whether you stole from him or he stole from you, he's still gonna cut your head off. He's trouble. He'll hurt you. - Why don't you just get out of here? - What do you mean? Why don't you just get out of this place? What's keeping you here? You've got your car. I mean, my mom... still feels attached to the house, and Franky. Is that what's keeping you here? Your mom and Franky? I don't know. What else... What else do I have? What about you? What about me? What if something happened, and we had to leave tomorrow? Would you come? Would you leave? - Me and you? - Yeah, me and you. Maybe. - More blood. - Big heart. Big blood heart. - Big blood heart. - Hello. Yeah, the kid's here. - She is. - This is the most beautiful heart... - ...I've ever seen in my whole life. - Okay. Billy, Dave would like to speak to you after you're done with your act. It's okay. I'll watch him. We're having so much fun. Say it. Say it. Look, look. - It's okay. - So she doesn't worry, say, - "mama..." - Mama. - "...we're having a bloody good time." - We have a "bundy" good time. Yes, we are... bloody good. - Bloody good. - Bloody good. - That's right. - That's right. - Bloody, bloody good. - Bloody, bloody good. Yes, we are. Yes, we are. - What? - Something like that there. Something like that. And you're just... you're just like... - I don't know. - Who cares? How much can you get? Go. Hide. - What's your name? - Marylou, but they call Me mama Aris. - I said, "what's your name?" - Marylou! - But they call me Mary Aris. - I said, "what's your name?" - Lady, what's your name? What's your name? - I told you! And you're not gonna... and you just... and you're just not gonna answer me. - What's your name? - Marylou! Call me Mama Aris! Now, what they call you, "busybody? "Ryan's hope." "Guiding light." "Search for tomorrow." "General hospital." What, you're not gonna say nothing to me? - That I love you, baby. - I just asked you to dance with me. - You're not gonna even answer me... - I love you. Love to cut your head off. Hey, lady, come on, come on! Just put her in there. - That's it? - Yeah, that's... that's it. That'll be $1, please. Don't touch my seat. - I'm sorry. - Nobody sits in that seat. - But who? - But me. Okay. Are you with that man over there? - No. - No? Okay. Go hide. Hide. Hey. What's your name? Rat. Rat? Yeah. Why? - Why is my name Rat? - Yeah. - 'Cause I've got a pet rat. - Oh, yeah? What's his name? - Nick. - Nick the rat? Hello! Hallelujah! Look at me, man! You look so ugly, dawg. God! 1, 2, 3, 4. Are you waiting for somebody? - I'm alone. - Oh, yeah? Want a ride home? No, I'm all right. I'm pretty close to here, so... Okay. I gotta take a piss anyway. I'm going in. Wait. Actually, yeah. I'll... I'll... I'll take that ride. - It's dark. - Yeah. - You got to be safe, right? - Yeah. - This is my friend Face. - Hi. You wanna know why he's called Face? You wanna know why? Why? Face? Get in the car. Come on. It's the best seat in the house. You can see the world from up here. Rat, Face, and Bully. Can I touch your hair? Can I just reach... can I reach... can I reach out for a second? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Come to me. Come to me. Give me that. Give me that. Oh. Come here. I wanna smell it. Billy, we're never gonna be friends if you sit so far from me - and I can't hear you... one good ear. - Sorry. - There it is. - Get your free drink, and when you do, you put your hand inside of your pocket, and you leave lots of money for that waitress, because she's here just for you and you and you. - You brought your kid. - We'll be right back. Did you bring your kid here? I got stuck, and I'm sorry. It's not very sexy, is it? - It won't happen again. - Don't do it again. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for our host this evening... Dave! Dave, ladies and gentleman. Come on. Feel the light. Feel it, Dave. Come to me. Don't think, just stand. Stand and deliver, Dave! Come! - I'm gonna be your ride tonight. - Come, now. Tonight, no man should feel so much pleasure than this man should feel right now. Hello. Hello. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the sultan of surprises, your host tonight, the one, the only, Dave. Stop it. There are some basic human needs. We try to cater to some of them. We can't get all of them. This is about one of them. All day I've faced a barren waste Without the taste of water Cool water Old Dan and I with throats burned dry And souls that cry for water Cool, clear Water Keep on moving, Dan Don't you listen to him, Dan He's a devil, not a man He spreads the burning sand with water Dan, can you see that big green tree Where the water's running free And it's waiting there for me and you?

Speaking of which, I hate to ask you, but... Can you tell me when I can expect my first paycheck? Oh, you'll get it a week after you started. If you wanna make real money in the meantime, you go down to the shells. You get to keep... everything you make down there. You've seen the shells, right? Yeah. I'm a little bit claustrophobic, though, so I might have a problem. I'm not sure. Yeah, well, I have a problem, too, you know? I like to fuck. That's my problem.

Right, I look like my picture should be on the million-dollar bill. I got on these pretty shoes, and you mean to tell me you ignoring a gentleman like me. Boy, what the world's coming to. He's funny?
