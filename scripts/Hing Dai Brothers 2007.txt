Bro Tin. Bro Tin. How about Ghost? Tell Bro Tin yourself. Crashed someone dead. What should we do? Move in. Let me drive the car! Why didn't you wait for me? I couldn't hold myself. Selling drugs is breaking our rules. As his big brother, I should have looked over him. Let me do it myself! You are so presumptuous now. This is all for today. If anyone committed the same thing, I would take it more seriously. What should we do? We crashed someone dead. Police station, someone was knocked down in Poon Lung Road. Bro, it was an accident. Don't be afraid. Bro Tin, here is Ghost's son. What's your name? His father is Ghost and he is Ghostie. Come on, Ghostie. Kowtow to your father. Kneel down. Such a misery kid. Let's prepare his Dad a funeral ceremony. Wish the sky will clear up from now on. Master, I find myself a little bit... Brother Tin, it's only a normal rise and fall. I told you, you will enjoy 2o years fortune. You will be fine in these 2o years. How about 2o years later? Happy is he who is content. To be truth, you should have resigned by then. That's right. Master. I have two sons. I wonder who should succeed my business. I can't answer that. Maybe you should ask our ancestors. All the ancestors above, your pupil Tin Tam have a question to ask. Wish teachers can guide him. You insist to send the younger one to America? The elder brother is shy. I should keep him by my side. I understand. But they are kids only, how can you separate them that way... Master said if we don't separate them... they would end up killing each other. What's that mean? How can I know? Maybe we will send him a few years later. How many years? Wait until he is 18. Let's take some photos. Ready, cheers. One more. Wait a second. Ghostie, come here. Come on, take photos with us. Take some photos. Come on. Take some photos. Sir, your breakfast. Ghostie, have you found the deliverer? Yes. Start now. What are you doing? Police station please, I discovered a drug dealing. The license plate is LK 2221. Bro Joe... Yum, Hoi, Thunder... Uncle Chow. The last portion is for Uncle 9 and Brother Kui. Here is your bonus. Thanks for your help, our business went so well last year... in both gambling cruise ships, transportation, and red wine. Especially those cruise ships... our turnover was a double when comparing with the year before last. Maybe we should immediately enter the market. It's great. We can make a larger profit by then. Just a pinch only. If this is the case next year, I would simply donate it. My father and I got one portion only. Do you mean either one of us haven't paid our effort? You have earned enough already. You are running such a big business. Are you talking about our restaurant? How much can we earn with this? Honey. I'd better take my medicine. You have taken it already. From my father's generation, up to this very moment, our company rule states clearly that... nobody should have a finger in the drugs. All of you understand... I hate those who get involved with drugs. We all understand the rule for sure. But I am not sure if anyone would get out of line. Drugs? Don't look at me. I sell only fish balls and rice roll. Move faster. Honey, it's time for you to take the medicine. The girl with hair bend looks better. My father used to tell me... Careful with what you do, there is an eye in the sky. No matter what you did... you can never hide the truth from the sky. You are right. I am wondering what your Dad did, and turned your mom like that. Honey. Honey. Honey. Uncle 9. I respect you as an elder member, drink up this cup of wine, and I will pretend nothing happened. Hello? Hello? What happened? What happened? Bastard! Okay, I will be there. Ghostie! Don't you think I will take an action? It must be the rabid dog. I left my attach case. Get that for me. I will wait in the car. What happened? You are suspected to possess drugs. Get off. Who are you? Police. Your pass? I don't have it. We are from the Eastern district crime unit. According to the rules in Chapter 232... We are not shooting the Police Report. Get off the car. Please move faster. I am in a hurry. Search it real slow. Search over every corner of the car. Please take care of him. I will get there soon. Let me put on a record first. I suspect that I was set up. If you find anything, it should be from a mole. Are you teaching me now? Or you want me to handle this by myself? Do you know what kind of people you are? If you were set, it doesn't mean that you are innocent, it only means that you are such a useless big brother. Let me tell you, my father is in the hospital. If I can't see him today... I promise you can enjoy an early retirement. Boss. Seems like you are going to enjoy an early retirement. You are really set up. This way please. Dismiss. Solicitor of Mr Tam, her name is Ching. Sir Lau. Mr Tam. Handle this. Let's come straight to the point. I will apply bail for my party. There are lots of forms. No need to ask. But we found hundreds grams of heroin in his car... this is a serious criminal case. The report hasn't published yet. How can you know they are drugs? It can be flour, grape sugar or even wall dust. If I were the chief, would I smuggle drugs myself? My party is a proper businessman. Deal with legal business, and don't have any criminal records. So what? He was set. Now his father is seriously injured in the hospital. Please be magnanimous. Have you ever seen a cat let go of a mouse? There is white and black mouse. But they are no difference. Let's follow the procedures then. I request to meet my party alone, and ask for his instructions. Let's go. We have asked for you. Your father stays in ICU. Stable condition. Did you touch the bag? This lawsuit can easily canceled. The bag wasn't in the car and didn't carry your fingerprints. Legal Department will withdraw the charges for sure. Those who set you up weren't professionals. My Dad is fine? Dr Au said at this stage he won't risk his life. How about my mother? She is safe. Ghostie has transferred her to another rest home. Ask my brother back. No matter what, I ought to leave. I got it. Is Ghostie here? He is. I want to meet him. Yes. He has run riot. Are we going to revenge? Take off your sun glasses first. I asked you to bring me the brief case... why did you take so long? Kui held me and spoke a few words. He asked me to stand by his side. Be assured. I was raised by Tam family. Sir Cheung. Why are you here? Sir Cheung, have a good chat. Bye. Promoting our relationship of course. You know I am not an emotion-swayed person. It counts on the other party then. Tell me if you need any help. I put in straight then. I would like to apply bailing for my client. Who is your client? Yiu Tam. He was set. You work in that enterprise? Are you having bias towards him? We are talking about a great deal of heroin... even the judge will not let him go. How can you not understand that? That's why I am begging you. Wah, in fact, I am not asking you to withdrawn the charge. I only wish that he can visit his Dad. His Dad is dying now. This is my responsibility. I dare not to get it wrong. Sorry. You are still here? I'd better go now. You knew her? She was my classmate in Beijing University. Come for Yiu Tam? What? Nothing. Check her relationship with Yiu. Fine. And check yours relationship too... Leave it. Mess my stuffs up? Come on if you got enough guts. Whenever you mess my stuff, I will kill one of your Dads. Let's see how many Dads you have! Dad, the old man has retired already. So what? He can simply neglect everything? Uncle 9. Tin Tam is still alive. Find someone to kill him. He can't leave the hospital alive. Why are you bothering that old man? But not dealing with the in charge. Our target is the enterprise but not Tin Tam. - Chacha. - Uncle 9. Do my justice, do you think I am wrong? Tell me? Tell me? Tell me! Uncle 9, they are different methods. I asked whether you think I am right or wrong. Dad... just pretend nothing happened. Kui, you are right. We should not care about that old man. Just follow your views. We will get the enterprise sooner or later. Your worship, prosecution applies for the case to be adjourned for 4 weeks to the 15th of October. For Government Chemist's Certificate. In view of the seriousness of the case, the prosecution applies for the defendant to be remanded in jail custody. Defense counsel, do you have any application? Your Worship, I apply for granting bail pending trial to my client. The reason is that he has no criminal conviction. My client has a decent job and has a good economic background. There is one more point... How is my Dad? I employ the best doctors to take care of him. Wish Uncle Tin will be fine. Where is my elder brother? My client has got a vicious trauma in his brain... which is customarily called brain cancer. May I submit a medical report of my client for your worship's reference. True or not? I believe it is true. I have sufficient reasons to believe... that in case my client is remanded in jail custody, he might not be able to receive appropriate medical treatment. Therefore, I humbly urge Your Worship to grant bail to the defendant. Brother... How are you? Have you met with Dad? He is still lying unconscious. I heard that you were in the court, are you okay? Doesn't matter. The most important is our Dad. Dr Au. Mr Tam is awake now. You may visit him. But he is very weak, make sure you don't stay long. Thank you. - Dad. - Uncle Tin. Are you okay? How are you? Haven't seen you for ages. Do you have a girlfriend? Separate for a few months now. If you find an appropriate girl, delay no more. It's fine if she is a white people. How about Blacks? - Sorry. - Ghostie, call the doctor. Not now. I have something to talk with your brother. Stay outside with Ghostie. Take care. Master told fortune about you brothers. It is Xuanwu Gate incident. Emperor Taizong of Tang killed his own brother... and gained the world. Dad, man will triumph over nature. I was forced to believe. Master said I would enjoy 2o years fortune. After that 2o years... I met with a mishap. In short... no matter what the symbol said, it will happen. That's fine. You should separate with him. I am worrying about Dad. Wish he can come out safe and sound. How about your work? IT. Have a bright future. I am facing a lot of competitions. Those American companies only focus on performance. They will fire you all in a sudden. It's not like you. Can do whatever you want. It is only the surface. If you are not happy with yourjob, you can look for another. What about me? Write an application letter to another gang? Just look at Dad, is it worth? You have to take risks. Let alone this is our heirloom. I should guard over it. Will you come back and help me? How can I work in this high risk industry? You will stay in America, and never return? I want to get back too. But whenever I asked Dad, he would say no to me. What's wrong? Haven't exercised for long, right? Three things. Legal Department has issued the report already. Charge was withdrawn because of insufficient evidence. Seems like he was set. At the same time his Dad was attacked. I believe someone wants to remove them. A storm is going to blow in the enterprise. What? I said it would be easier... if two of them had been blown away. - Great. - Got it? Yes. Second thing is... Yiu Tam's younger brother has come back from America. I checked already. He is like a white paper. Are you a new comer here? Which gangster doesn't come out from a white paper? You are such a lucky guy. I know that. And? Pay back. Pay back a pinch first. Okay, pay me back later. Take this. Are you serious? How dare you! - What? - What? What are you asking? - The solicitor. - I checked already. Why didn't you tell? We guys... shouldn't have talked about this stuff. I checked that... Sir Cheung and Ching had dated before. But I'm not sure about how long was it. What are you talking? I didn't ask you to check with this. You did. I asked you to check for Ching and Yiu Tam. No, you asked me to check for Ching and Sir Cheung. - When? - That day. - That day? - Really. - I asked you to check? - Yes. - And you have checked? - Yes. Why didn't you tell? Congratulations. Easily finished the case. What? You asked me here to talk about this? Why are you helping Yiu Tam? Are you asking... why am I helping a gangster? I mean... we can all employ a solicitor. I just don't want you to help him. I am not picking out good or bad people as my clients. What about boyfriends? I love bad guys. How long have you been with him? You have checked that already. He doesn't suit you. I know what I am doing. Be careful. You will risk yourself. Dr Au, thanks for your help last time. Take a look at the report. Isn't it cool? Sorry. We heard that there is drugs. I believe you understand that it is a trick. Maybe you can tell me who is the tricker. This is a private area. You have no rights to search. Our warrant. I understand that business is business. But this is my Dad's funeral. Please respect us. As you know business is business, we may charge you for obstructing police. Shun, leave them. Do you think all our Tam's family members are bad guys? Your younger brother? - Is he your brother? - Yes. Are you coming back from Mars? Don't you know what kind of business are you running? Sorry, don't disturb police. Please cooperate. Show your ID cards. You can't speak or leave. - ID card. - Please show you ID cards. Mr Tam, can you hear me? Sun. Leave him. I am letting off firecrackers. Of course I am happy. I am busy. That's it! What are you doing! I don't need to explain to you. What are you doing! Stop! Stop! Stop! I let you search. But whoever makes my Dad... can't finish his life peacefully... I will kill his whole family. My Dad has left. Please don't disturb him. Sorry. Sorry. Dismiss. Dismiss! I feel so shameful in the funeral. Shame for what? I mean those policemen. What are you talking about? The father and son not only killed our Dad, even made him left unhappily. Are you talking about Uncle 9? Why didn't you call the police? Why do you care about the signboard? This is what our Dad left. Maybe we can just start another business. Or else, we can simply change our signboard too! Dad said, our enterprise... can never fall on those outsiders. He didn't want our company end up into... an immoral, wicked one. Finally, it is still a gang. Has your brother got back to America? Not yet. Why are you asking? It's great for him to stay. Have a new blood. Furthermore, we old men got to step down. What did you say so? Do you think he is fine? We all saw that. He was so ruthless at the funeral. Seems like he is the one in charge. Uncle Chow... What will you do in Holland? Nothing. Just wait my death. Mr Tam, your brother is here. Shun, this is Uncle Chow. Do you remember? Uncle Chow. Enjoy your chat. See you. Let's have a dinner before you leave. Talk later. Let me bring you to meet a friend. In fact, you got everything already. Have you ever thought of running legal business? Are you teaching me now? Just takeover my place. Sometimes... it's fine to change. Boss, two apples please. Take the change. Do you recognize him? Master, what a coincidence? Yes, Uncle Gen. I brought my brother here. Young master. Uncle Gen, let us serve ourselves. Help yourselves then. Remember we had knocked off a guy when we were young? I nearly forget that. He is still alive. But cut off a leg. That's why... you can't change whatever you want. It's still there even you have forgotten. But you can't simply wipe it away. You are our family member. This seat is left by Dad. Besides our family, nobody dares to sit on it, or can sit on it. When will you leave? I would like to contribute to our family. What can you do? Deal with 9? Are you fine with it? Call the cops. You really think cops can help maintaining orders? Solving problems have lots of solutions. Why bother those gangsters? Trust me. Do you want me to watch over Shun in police station? Up to him. Maybe he wants to show himself. You really want to deal with him this way. Disagree? Will you listen to me? I won't. I am here to report for Nine Yim. He asked someone to kill my Dad. His son was in it too. Do you have any evidence? No. But isn't it your responsibility to find evidence? How do you know that? My brother told me. How can you believe whatever your brother says? Do you understand your brother's situation? Did he ask you to come? What do you mean? Listen, though I am from Tam's family, I am no gangster. Don't bother we cops to clear up for you. Do you understand? Dare to mess around in the police station? What position are you standing here? One more time. I am no gangster. What are you doing? Stop it or I will sue you as assaulting police! Do you have anything to add? If it is the truth, come straight to the point. I have nothing to add. Wasting my breath. He is just a white paper. Besides Yiu Tam, send someone to stalk 9. Every game has its rules. You may against it, but you must make it clear. Have you ever disagreed with my brother? Of course. What would you do? Since he is the big brother, I must listen to him. What if he is wrong? How can you know you are right? You are so obedient, if he asks you to die, will you follow? I will. Can you recognize me? Of course, you are my husband. I am your son, Shun. I sat besides you. We have a son called Shun? Is he borne by another woman? No, I didn't. - He is your son. - What... Mom, have some fruit. I know you. You are Shun. When did you come back? A little while before. It's great for you to come back. Just stay here and help your brother. You brothers can work together. Great. Honey. Am I right? Of course. Two hundred thousands. I have been staying with the old man for a life, but only worth this. He treated me for what? I can spend this amount in a set of Mahjong. You are not from Tam's family. Do you think you can earn a life yearlong payroll? Idiot. You are smart. Started earning great money long ago. Run a personal business. You want to stay and help me? Mom was right. We brothers can work together. It seems great. Though we have different opinions, we can accommodate each other. What is your advantage? PC and English. I can barely drink too. I have finished 3 cups already while you have 1. Do you think it means ''barely''? Brother, you get drunk. If the cops found... two packs of heroin on you, what would you say? If someone took aim on your head... what would you do? It's a real gun! - What will you do? - What's the matter with you? Why did you say you know then? Bullshit! I was just having fun with you. Don't be that serious. You scared me to death. Can't you take ajoke? No. Let's play. Drink a toast. Fine, let me ask you. Do you really want to help me? Yes. Serious. Are you okay? Are you okay? Come on. Seems like you can't walk a straight line. Are you okay? Get in the car. Let me drive. You are not familiar with the route, and I have an appointment. You can show me the way. Five! Twenty! You lose. Lose? I got nineteen. Why do I lose? Nineteen. Why do I lose? Why? Look at you. You are such a fool. What are you talking about? Do you know what are you talking about? No... No? No what? No... No what! No... I am so sorry. I am just having fun. Why are you crying? I got to go now. Aren't you leaving to have sauna? What don't you leave? Right. Chat later. Call me. Bye. Bill! I will be there in five minutes. Drive faster. Fine. Tell me the truth. Have you ever... killed anyone? You are such a fool. I believe you have watched movies before. Do you think I have to do it myself? That's right. Have we arrived yet? Nearly. Why is there so much hatred between Dad and 9? Turn left. Where is my car? Car... Didn't you say you have prepared it? Play tricks with me? It is coming... Why hasn't Uncle 9's car arrived yet? Sorry... Nine Yim... is a inborn bad guy. Do you think he worth dying? I am sure there is retribution. Turn left! No, should be turn right. Leave now. Leave. Call Sir Lau. Okay. Are you sure? The person you knocked down... is dead. It was an accident! I will turn myself in. Brother. Do you think it's only the cops looking for you? There is Kui too. You killed his Dad. Do you think he will let go of you? What should I do? Flee secretly. I will arrange for you. Why bother fleeing? I haven't broken the laws. Why do I ought to hide myself... I warn you... don't talk with me with this attitude! I will call the cops! Up to you. Brother! Brother! Master Kui, I saw it. The driver is Shun. With his elder brother next to him. Big brother, want a revenge? Dad... Whoever knocked you down... I must ask him to pay with his life! Master Kui, let me handle the two moles. Ching will manage everything for you in Thailand. How long am I going to hide? Until I ask you to come back. Can I stay here? Sir, you have a guest. You are home. So early? Take a seat. Where is your little brother? Why are you looking for him? Where were you at 11:37 p.m. Last night? And what were you doing? My brother was driving me to Tsim Sha Tsui. When we got past to An Tak Center, he accidentally knocked down a person, but he didn't stop... You may stop here. Our colleagues saw your brother is the driver. But you should know the deceased victim is 9. Really? And he has died? What a pity. Can you tell me, where is your brother? He was so scared. I asked him to turn himself in. And finally we got into a fight. Then he left. I am looking for him too. That's fine. Can you come by and cooperate with the investigation? Okay. But I will have a body check. Can I arrange it with my lawyer? Fine. Sir, in fact, you are dealing with bad guys. Now, the God has dealt with one already. Judgment and execution at the same time. Exactly what you want. Yes. What about you? Are you a nice guy or bad guy? What is your opinion? Nice guy. Just look at the means you use on your brother. Why didn't we take him back? Shut him 48 hours is fine. Don't make ajoke now. He is acting serious. How can you keep having fun? Uncle Chow, have you arrived Holland? Great. Thank you. I have put the pension in your account. Check with it. Take care. What's wrong? Nothing. You brothers are so different from the old days. We are still brothers. Sir Lau, looking for drugs again? No. I have a date with Mr Tam. Just see when can he help the investigation. Excuse me. Boss, I followed him to a restaurant in CWB. He just went inside. I saw him. You saw him? Where are you? Outside. Come in now. Why don't you say a few words to comfort me? My Dad was knocked to death yesterday. Who did this? A bloody fool. You did this? It's your brother. Sorry... I misunderstood you were the bloody fool. Let's finish the joke and focus on the important matter. Either hand over your brother or we have to negotiate about it. How to negotiate? Now we both are the person in charge. I am fair. From now on, we share the ownership of the enterprise. Maybe I simply give the ownership to you. Great. Why are you that serious? Can we cops share the news? Hong Kong Royal Police Force's responsibility... is keeping the orders, and a peaceful society. We don't care about your domestic affairs. But you must keep a peaceful atmosphere. After Sergeant Lam's detail description, I believe you all understand what we are talking about. We will sit there. It'd be best if you don't trouble us. Let's leave alone the enterprise. Hand over your brother. He has been to Thailand. Nobody told you about it? What tricks are you playing? Maybe from now on... I tell you everything I will do. Okay? What do you want from Shun? I am his elder brother. I can do what I want. I treat him as my younger brother too. I have bought you some daily commodities. Thanks. Take it to defend yourself. Is there really such a coincidence? Before I knocked down Nine, he exchanged the seat with me and then sent me to Thailand. Tell me, what my brother wants? How long have you been staying together? Tell me, is my brother a nice or a bad guy? It counts on the other party. How about to me? About you... You are the only one who can answer this question. I can't help if you think he is a bad guy. What about to you? When I knew him... he told me he would never have sex with another woman. Since he couldn't believe anybody. At first, I thought he was only cheating me. But gradually I understand... it is really difficult for him to trust. And he trusts me, so I think he is a nice guy. You think someone in his position can be a nice guy? You will find out the answer after you have takeover his place. Take an early sleep. Take it back. I don't need it. You can't control everything. Ching. Goodnight. What do you want to have? At your pleasure. - Let go! - What are you doing? - Let go! - What are you doing? Stop! Stop! What are you looking at? Bastard! Hold tight! Do you feel scared with your very first murder? What do you want from me? Leave as far as possible. Just dropped me here and asked me to leave again. Are you kidding? I am not leaving! If you don't tell me, I will ask my brother myself. You don't need to ask. In short, be careful about everyone around you. Including me. What kinds of people are they? Kui's followers? Or who do you think they are? How can they find me? Thanks for taking care of Shun. Ghostie, come here. Did you ask Kui to kill me here? Yes. I used you as a lead and revenge for Dad. Since everything is easier in Thailand. Don't you used to say you want to contribute? If you dare not into it, you may leave. I can handle everything. Ghostie, keep an eye on Shun. I will look for Kui. I want to revenge for Dad too. But how come we are using this method? Let me tell you, you got a gun. Kill me and you can go. You are here? How can you so careless and let my brother run away? It's fine. As long as you find him for me. Fine. Outside the barbershop in Chinatown at 11 o'clock. There are so many barbershops in Chinatown. But there is only one in Zhen Lung Gong. Fine. See you there. Shun, you work as a bait to lure him out. Ghostie, keep an eye on Shun. I got to kill Kui myself. Do you have any opinions? Bro Ghostie. Is there anything I don't know? It's your brother who arranged the smashup. I don't care what he wants, in short... I wish nothing will happen on you. Or your brother. Since I was raised up by Tam's. Why don't you appear? Playing tricks with me? Where are you? I have arrived. Can't you see me? Kui? He is in somewhere with hubbub of voices. Next street. Fine. I will come by. Are you okay? How are you? Why don't you answer the call? Why didn't you answer the call? Something happened. Where are you now? He said he will come by now. Lots of blood. Kui has come. No matter what... nothing can happen on Shun. Stay here! Bro Ghostie! I got Ghostie. Come out now. Leave me alone! How can you treat your followers that way? Ghostie has saved my life before. Come out! Come out! Bro Yiu! Chacha. Hospital... Send me to the hospital... I have been waiting this place for so long. Open the door! Are you human at all? Ghostie has die! I ought to revenge for him! Open the door! I know you are there. Don't tell people that you are my brother! Let me out! Have you prepared the passport? Bring him with you to America tomorrow. And I will finish my stuffs in Hong Kong. After six months, you can get back. At that time, hand over all my business to him. Relax. I will be fine. See you out there. Excuse me, check out please. Are you looking for your friend? He just gone. Shun killed someone in Thailand. And Yiu is lost after he has returned to Hong Kong. What happened? I don't know. You don't know? Thailand cops are chasing him. I am sure you know his location. I don't know. I only know that they will come back. Make sure they can't find each other. What happened? We have arrived. I have been waiting for you a few days. Were you having fun in Thailand? Do you have anything to tell me? If not, let me come straight to the point. You were found in the front page of Thailand newspapers. You know, they still have the death penalty. I wonder... it's only my presumptions... I think you don't have the guts to do it. I believe it's your brother who betrayed you. Tell me and let me tell you. Speak. Speak now! Don't you know that your brother wants to remove you? My colleagues were there when you knocked down 9. They saw everything. He is an inborn bad guy. Just tell me where is he, I will arrest him... then you can concentrate on running your business. Sir Lau, I believe you have got it wrong. That was an accident only. Though I was trapped in Thailand, the one who trapped me wasn't my brother. He is a nice guy. He will never set me up. Let go of my brother. It is nothing to do with him. I am the one who arranged the smashup. Fine, where are you now? Furthermore, I am the one who killed Kui in Thailand. I need to know your situation. If you want to arrest me, come to the fruit stalls in Yau Ma Tei by yourself. Fine. Drop me off. Hold on please. Cheung Sir, yes. I found Shun already. Now I am going to find his brother. Have a try, remember be careful. I will be fine. What happened? Nothing. Let me come with you. No need. I hand the international criminal to you... for my pay back. Police station. I want to pee. I need to pee. What are you looking at? You need to pee? Are you urgent? Want me to go with you? Can I take a look at it? Do you want me to go with you? Driver, please make a call for me. The license plate is FB6775. I left an important thing. What kind of thing is it? Something fatal. Why did you set your brother up? None of your business. After he came back from Thailand, he trusts nobody. This is what I want. Or how can he take over my place? You want to quit? I am looking for a successor. You are such a nice elder brother. Listen, I am the head of all of this. I arranged the smashup of 9. I also killed Kui. All of them are nothing to do with my brother. Let go of him! Okay? Time is running out now. I have two months left only. I will not let go of you, even you have only a day left. If you can let go of my younger brother... I can hand over all my crime records to you. My brother is a nice guy. He is a white paper. I just want to wipe all his black mark... before my death. I want him to take over our enterprise cleanly. I beg you. Let go of him. Be assured. If he is innocent, nobody is going to trap him. Brother! Let's go... Stop... Brother... Why didn't you tell me? Nobody can arrest you! - Nobody can... - Let go! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze... Or I will shoot! Freeze! - Put down your gun! - Step back! Step back! Run! Brother! - Put down your gun! - Step back! If you come any closer, I will shoot! Put down your gun! Step back! Ask your younger brother to put down the gun! Run! Put down the gun! Do you want me to shoot? This seat you are sitting... is left by Dad. Besides our family, nobody dares to sit on it, or can sit on it.
