Team DrC Dear John, l've just opened the shop. Don't come here asking for money! l already told you what l had to say! Vijayan, you came to me asking for money. And l have come here for that money! So shouldn't we have some respect for each other? Sit. Sit down man! l don't know if it's because l'm rich. All these guys respect me. But luckily l have respect only for money! John, You took almost double of the original amount from me as interest. l won't pay anymore! This business is over! So there's neither money nor respect for me? Bringing someone else's cash into our own pocket is called business! lt's an art, isn't it? What's the point in being furious about it? You're trying to teach me business? You son of a b##Ch! Chase all these rascals away! Let me see if l can do business here! Get out!! Team DrC 'Kali' (Rage) Team DrC Dad, just go check what happened. What? Rent.. l haven't received it yet. Hey, it's not urgent. You can give me later. Anjali.. l saw her leaving from here in tears. Errr.. l was just saying.. My God! What is this? Scaring people? You got scared, didn't you? - l'm not scared! Anyway you've decided to go.. So l thought l'll drop you till there. Oh! So you came to drop me? You needn't! l know how to go there myself. Can you slow down, please? l can't even utter a word. You lose your temper at the drop of a hat! - Leave him Matthukkutty, he loses his temper easily. ls it? You lose your temper easily, huh? Let me see! - What happened? Didn't you hear me? l asked you what happened? l.. l fell down.. Tell me the truth. Did someone hit you? Gosh. What happened, son? Stand up. What happened? That Mathukkutty hit me, mom. Aren't you ashamed to come here crying.. after being beaten up by those wastrels? Why are you shouting at him? Go ask those kids who hit him. Hey Krishnadas! You should raise your child well. Come here. Did you see his nose? lt was smashed by your dear son! lf this happens again, l won't be reacting like this. l'm telling you! Come here! You won't play here anymore. Did you hear that? Whom are you staring at? Leave the cane! Get out from here! Don't enter my class ever again. l called you so many times last night. And your line was busy. Where were you? Leave me! Siddhu, those guys hit me! Aren't you ashamed to cry after getting beaten up? Hit them back! - l... Hit them! Catch them! Close the gates! Move! Team DrC Where's Sunny? Come here. Hit him. l said, hit him! Finish them!! You think you're a hero seeing all these cheers and applause? Hitting people in campus is not so heroic! lt's better to beat up people than being beaten up, right? l'm scared. When you start reacting violently for every damn thing, it really scares me. We're in that volatile age, right? lt will change gradually. Keep in mind that you're in your final year. You should pass in your exams. And then get ajob. l don't think my dad is going to agree. For what? To marry you! Why? You don't want to? Do l? l do, l do! Team DrC Move! There she is. All the best! - l'll come in the evening. What, man? What happened? My dear bro, l sold that property for the minimum rate l could get. l didn't try to make any profit. l don't think real estate business would be worthwhile anymore. Of course! Why are you taking it? Who are you to make me wait like this? Hey.. See.. He's here. - We should teach him a lesson. What happened? l don't know! Who's this? Falling down just like that? Get up. Don't get people talking. Take a decision regarding this. And don't think you can come home after that. Who's this? - Dad! Give them the garlands. Anjali! You don't be tensed about all that now. Everything will be alright! Shouldn't we sleep? Anjali is waiting. Team DrC Are you married? Yes! You're new here? l'm Prakashan. Sidharth! - See you around. Hey.. Hey.. l'll... l'll pay this time. The bank deducts a fees. lt's all gone with that. You're saying the same thing again! l want my money back. There's only 900 left. - l don't want to know all that. l don't want anything else. l just want my money back!! 1 minute. Nothing, Sir. How are you? - Fine! Anjali! Nothing is in it's place in this house! Team DrC Won't even respond! - Started in the morning itself?. How else will it be! You pick up junk from all over the place and bring it home! What junk? Where's the car key? Why are you so furious forthat? Can't you search calmly? l wasn't furious. l just asked where the car key was. Got late? Me too.. Which one should l fill to deposit cash? - Bro, can you give me your pen? Yellow! Bro, pen. l'll give it right back! Deposit this, son. Don't deposit all of it into this chequebook. Deposit half on this book and half on this ATM card. All the money in your account can be accessed by the ATM card. l don't want that. People at home will take all the money carelessly. My daughter's son Basheer. He is quite notorious. And, can you make a system where you can withdraw only 500 if you enter 1000? There's no such system here. - Then what kind of a bank is this? Let me see if l can find a bank with such a system! Wow! lt's working again! See... What is it, Prakashan? l was just testing it. lt's working. Have you seen the other end of this sheet? Where is it? - What the.. Take it and get lost! What, man? What is it, brother? lt's not working.. Use this.. - Thanks brother. Hey sir.. Account number has only 8 digits. But to fill it, there are 14 columns. Even if l write from left to right or right to left, 5 columns are still empty. What should l do? You just write your account number there, Sir. Oh! That's all? Ok fine! l shall. 'Please do not use mobile phones here.' l'm not dead! l just came to the bank. l'll call you back. Bloody hell.. Sorry Sir. l have a lot of work. Even l have a lot of work! ls it? Sir, you can go to the next counter. Please! You can go there. - You can have him! Team DrC l want to deposit Rs.10 lakhs as fixed deposit. ln my wife's name. Sir, my work is over. - Please fill this form, Sir. Here you go! l'm leaving. Go man! Hey.. That FD customer had actually come to me. lt was me who sent him to you. You should remember that! You didn't even treat us when you bought your car. l'm just reminding you. Dude, just tell me what you have to say. You don't have to hit me for that. Can't even touch you or what? Sorry! Overtime, is it? Good going! What is it, Ma'am? - Come, sit. l bought this for you. What plans for the evening? lf you're free, we can plan something. l'm a little busy today, ma'am. We'll plan this another day. Why doesn't she call me! How come you're so busy in the evening? So tall, but good for nothing! Team DrC Have you left the office? - Yes. l'm at City Centre. Can you come here? Why are you there? - Shopping. l've reached. Where are you? l'm on the 3rd floor. At the 'ln' Store. Can we have 2 minutes if you don't mind? - l do mind! What kind of a man is he? So arrogant! Why isn't she looking! Let me check there. - Ok madam. Ah. She has turned. Come, let's go! Oops! That's her husband? l'm screwed! lt was a busy day at the bank. Some customers drive us crazy. And by evening, my mood is completely spoilt! Let's get back home. l'll make your mood alright! l don't know how l brought it till here. Driving isn't meant for me. You drive. You'll learn only if you drive. lf you keep skipping it, you'll never learn. Drive without fear. l am with you, right? That's exactly why l am scared! lf you stare at me like that, l'll lose even the little confidence l have. lf you want me to drive, you should be really patient. Don't get angry. Okay. Don't worry. You start the car. l won't get angry. Start the car. Release the clutch slowly. Careful! Be careful. Didn't you see him? No! Press the clutch. Press the clutch and shift the gear. lsn't this the brake.. l mean, isn't this the clutch? That's the brake! There's a car behind.. You almost hit him. Okay, drive. The car is not driving you. You are driving the car! That's all you need to know! Which gear are you on now? Which gear? l don't know! - You don't know? Don't you know it's the 2nd gear from it's sound? Shift the gear. lt's bad for the car! Press the clutch fully and shift the gear! Why are you getting angry for that? Didn't l tell you that l'm not driving? l didn't get angry!! There's a car right behind you! What nonsense? Where? Anjali? Are you blind? This is not rocket science! Start the car, press the clutch fully, shift to first gear, and drive! There's not much work needed, Sir. lncluding service tax, it's coming up to around Rs.12,000 only. Your documents are all correct, right? l will claim the insurance for you. My master has gone mad!! My master has gone mad!! So you can decide the prices yourself! Since my master is mad, you can choose the price for whatever you buy! Master has gone mad? So this Assistant Manager is hitting on you, huh? Will you be promoted soon? lf she goes on like this, she'll have her way with me! l'll kill you! You.. Can't you change this ringtone, Anjali? There you go! You were waiting to pick on something, is it? Pick up the phone, Anjali! Who is it? That's some pervert. He's so jobless! Let me talk to him. God! That'll be an even bigger problem! l'll tell you when l want you to talk to him. Why don't you chew a little louder? - Of course! Team DrC Mom! Has Siddharth left? He is just getting ready. Tell me mom. What's happening? - There's a good news! l called to tell you that. A good alliance has come for Aju. Ourfamily & close relatives have to go to their place. We haven't fixed the date yet. You'll come with Siddharth, right? Of course! Mom, l'll call you later. And yea.. - Yes? Can you ask papa to call Siddhu? Here. Okay dear. l'll tell him. Okay mom! Sheesh! l'll fix it right away! lt was mom on the phone. A marriage proposal has come for Aju. To fix it, she has called us both home. Your dad is still furious with me, isn't he? We should definitely go! That will put an end to dad's anger. You haven't come to Masinagudi yet, right? We'll go to Ootty also after that. l'll think about it. Did you put on that perfume? A little! Hey, l was just testing it. Don't be upset, my girl! What the... Team DrC Customer care has received some complaints from your desk. You should pay some more attention to relationship with customers. Or it will affect your career. Your car is ready. Sir, since your car has only third party insurance, you can't claim even a single penny! You will have to pay the entire amount! Why are you so happy about it? l'll lose my job if l don't smile while talking to customers, Sir. - lf you do it right now, you'll lose only 30,000. - 30,000? - Yes, sir. Do you want some coffee? - No! Gosh! The power's gone. What? We'll leave then. See you Anjali. Juice.. - Hey.. lt's fine. Okay then. Shall we leave? Come Chuppu. Let's go. Such a loser you are! Did you see that? He.. He's a brat! You asked for it! Congratulations! Team DrC There's no point reading all this. Now you don't even differentiate between kids and elders. You heard what that fellow said while he left, right? Big deal. You only want to find faults with me all the time! At least you have someone to do that. lt's not that l'm not trying.. Sometimes, l just lose it! l know.. That you're not doing all this on purpose. And that you don't like doing it. But only l know that.. Others may not understand your situation. lf you understand, that's enough for me! No! You can't go on like this. l don't like you being this bad guy to everyone else. This fury of yours should go away. Only you can take an effort to do that. We need everyone, right? All of them? Team DrC Now you can look at each other and smile. Team DrC Got late? -A little. All of them are inside. - Okay. Where's that woman who gave you the perfume? Team DrC The one in the black saree. Where? With a tattoo on her back.. She's a little aged right? But doesn't look like it. Don't make me talk! Her stupid tattoo.. Why are you standing here all worked up? Go have something to eat. lt's free! And you'll get this again only next year! l can't even say that? Did you introduce her to Smitha ma'am? Huh? - No! Shall l? l shall! You'll be in a fix! Bye sister. Has it been long since you came? No. We just reached, ma'am! l'll introduce you to all ourfriends here. Are you confused seeing the spread? What confusion? You haven't eaten since morning to hog at this party, right? Carry on! Good going! Where's the ice cream? Are you bored? l knew it! What happened? l have to go to Masinagudi. There's a function at my wife's place. Did you elope and get married? Doesn't look like it. lsn't he really short-tempered? How do you tolerate him? You must be having a lot of patience! You're here? That's why she got scared and stopped talking. Okay then! See you! Did you eat something? Go eat, man! What did he say? We have to leave early in the morning. l haven't packed any bags. Shall we go? We've come here anyway.. We'll have dinner and leave. Come! l'm hungry! - Me too! You start. l'll just come. - Okay. Want to join for some drinks? No. l'll leave soon. - Are you sure? l have to drive. - Oh okay. Siddhu, it's my daughter's first birthday next Sunday. We're giving a small treat, at home. You should come with your wife. He's really happy to go for others' party! l have been behind him for a treat ever since he bought a car. And he hasn't, till date! Must be making a whole lot of savings! Enough! l have told you many times not to hit me while talking! Why can't you get it into your head? What did l say? Leave it. l just asked for a treat. Team DrC Which son of a b@#ch is not getting sleep at this hour?. What? Cat got your tongue? Talk, you rascal! Hello dear? Anjali, is there a problem there? Mom, Siddhu thought it was someone else. There's this guy who keeps calling and troubling me. ls it? Siddhu picked up without checking the number. l'll give him the phone. l don't want to talk. Ask them to start early if they're coming. Papa called to ask if you had started. Okay mom. l'll call you. Are you happy now? How would l know that it was your dad! Even if it wasn't him, you will abuse, is it? No one has to help me by abusing or hitting people! l can't bear this anymore! What to do! l have always been like this! l know to behave like this only. You eloped with me knowing all this, right? lf you can't bear me anymore, you don't have to stay with me! You can decide! So that's the solution for all this? lf l also leave you, then.. - Nothing will happen! What will happen if you leave me? Will l die? l will live alone! Stay only if you want to! Get out! No! Team DrC Are you ok? Siddhu, be careful! Siddhu, no!! Please! Siddhu, stop the car! Please! That bloody.. Shut up Anjali! Stop! Stop, you swine! 'Saccharine' Siddhu, l'm scared! Hold on tight! Didn't you see what he did? For my sake! For my sake! Let him go! You are hopeless! Didn't you see him take the wrong side of the road? So? You should teach him a lesson? What if something had happened? You have a reason for everything. l can't go on with such a short-tempered person. l want to live peacefully. Team DrC l'm hungry. Why didn't you tell me while we were passing that town? There won't be anymore shops on the way now. Where are you going? To Masinagudi, Sir. Where are you coming from? Kochi, Sir. - Ok. You can go. Sir, is there any restaurant nearby? lf you go straight from here, there's one nearthe highway. Hey. That's the restaurant. Wash your hands. Come. Should we eat here? l'm really hungry! The headlight's on! Team DrC This rooster is so restless! Savithri, Hey Chakkara, your rooster is in form, huh? Let him have fun till it lasts! What did he say? What for? To pick a fight with him? He didn't say anything. Where the hell were you? Can't you see that there are customers here? - l was here only, master. l didn't go anywhere. - When you called me, l was in the toilet. - lf you can't, quite yourjob and leave! - You should work properly as long as you are here! - Won't listen to anything! Just keeps yapping all the time. - Didn't l ask you to clean that table? Get lost! l didn't go anywhere, master. l went to get water since you asked me to. - Moron! - Useless! Shall we leave? lts okay. There won't be anymore hotels on the way. We'll leave after eating something. Brother, what food do you have here? What do you want? What do you have here? Tell me what you want. Dosa? - We don't have Dosa. Chappathi? No Chappathi as well. Then what do you actually have? Only Parotta. Why didn't you say that earlier? lnstead of making us ask! Brother, two plates of Parotta. And any curry would be fine! Then why didn't you say this earlier? Why did you get angry at him? - What else should l do? Didn't you see his attitude? You can expect only so much from such a hotel. We have come here for dinner. And not to teach manners to the people here. There you go! Advising again! Just keep it there. Brother, do you have something to drink here? What do you want? Do you have juice? Yea. We have juice, tea, soda, cola.. What do you want? Anything is fine. Brother, two pineapple juices. Fresh, please. Fresh, right? This place is so filthy. l'm really hungry. Eat only if you really want to. You sit here. Hey Savithri! What is it, Chakkara? - Come! Hey! What is this? Brother, there's something in it. - What? Oh. ltsjust a fly! Team DrC We shouldn't have come here. We'll leave quickly. l have to use the restroom. Okay. Come fast. The bill. l can't even show my face to my friends, bro! What to do! Deduct Rs.80 from this bill. Yes, Sir? Did you say something? Deduct Rs.80 from this bill & tell me the final amount. Dude, just check this. How much does he want us to deduct? 80 Rupees. Sir, there're no such discounts here. That too, Rs.80? No way! Every Rupee is precious! lnterest rates are at 30%% now.. l didn't drink that pineapplejuice. l asked you to deduct it's price. Bill for something you didn't drink? Hey Mani? - Yes! Can't you check these bills properly? He says he didn't have the juice! l've only added the rates of whatever he ordered! ls it my fault if he didn't drink it? l had even changed it for him. lsn't it fair to pay for what you ordered, Sir? l won't pay a rupee more than the price of what l had. Don't be angry, Sir. lt's not our fault if you didn't like it, right? lt'll be quite difficult for you to leave from here without paying the bill. Right, John? Are you threatening me? Then l dare you to get it from me! Chakkara, he is furious! You do one thing. You had enough food, right? You don't have to pay. l'll excuse it. You can leave. Are you kidding me? l don't want anything for free from you! Tell me the exact amount. lf you're paying, you will have to pay the whole thing. Siddhu, Just pay the bill. Let's leave. Do you have any cash? Oops! l haven't taken my purse! How can you leave home without taking your purse? Why are you getting angry at me? Where's your money? That landlord asked me for rent while l was leaving. l gave him all the cash l had. What do we do now? Chakkara, l think he's in a fix. Me too, John! You're always quite excited when you see such young girls, Chakkara. l'm young at heart, John! - Yea right! We don't accept cards here, Sir. We aren't that advanced yet. l don't have cash. Didn't l tell you that you needn't pay? See, that poor girl is sweating there. ls there any ATM nearby? Why are you still angry, Sir? ls there an ATM nearby, Chakkara? lf it's such a matter of pride for him, let him pay & then leave! There is one ATM nearby. Just 2 kms ahead on this road. Then so be it. You go and come back. Come! Team DrC How can you leave already, Sir? What guarantee do we have that you'll come back once you leave? What do you think, Chakkara? l'm not so sure, John. lf he's not sure, l'm not too. Let him do one thing. Let him go and come back. Till then, she can be here. - Yea! That's good! You're quite clever, Chakkara! Why? Doesn't look like it? No!! He's removing his watch, John. No, Sir. There's no need for all that. Don't treat us like cheapos. l trust you. So you can go & come back. And she will be safe here. Don't create an issue out of this. Didn't l ask you to leave decently? But now, since you've started the game, we will play till we finish it! You will leave only after paying me! You go and get the cash. Me alone? Listen to me. lts not safe if you stay here. He's clevererthan you, Chakkara! l'll be back soon. Until then, don't create any problem here. The car is in gear. Let her go. You come here! Mummy! Shaji, l doubt she'll come back! Where did this loser come from? - How fast was she driving! - His leg must be broken. - Push! Sir, Don't be out in the cold. Come, sit inside. Where do these people come from! Team DrC That doesn't work, Sir. You can call from my phone. You're really tensed. lt's not right to call your wife's phone from a stranger's number. Keep it there. Play properly! Keep it here. Brother, - What is it? Swami has given the interest. - Oh. You got it? - Ya. Keep it here. Here! - Keep it here. What is it? Tell me! - Come here! Hey. Make it fast. Hey, how much did you keep? Team DrC Bro.. Brother?. ls there an ATM nearby? - Huh? What? ATM. ls there any nearby? l don't know! l don't know! ls there a police station nearby? Police station? Yes! There! That side? - Yes. Vidyaji, looks like the girl is trapped. l won't let her go! Get lost! Buy some good food for him! Useless idiot! So this is what you do? But you don't look like a thief. l had a doubt from the time l saw you. Take the bike. l dare you. Take the bike! Take it! Team DrC A#ole! So much trouble ever since you came here! Lock him inside! Bro, get out quickly. Bro! Team DrC Vidyaji, The girl is driving really well, isn't it? l won't let her escape! Fell into a ditch, is it? Phew! You were driving so fast!! Team DrC Open it! Come! Come! There's no one here. - Don't hit me! - Remove the belt. Come on! You're quite strong, huh? They will always come at the wrong time! Bloody nuisance! Ok. Don't cry madam. Relax. You don't have to worry at all. Sir, it was me who called you. l saw the lorry driverthere. Come ma'am. Get into the car. He was troubling her, Sir. As soon as your car came, he ran away! Hey, take her car and follow us. - Okay Sir. Team DrC Madam, please wait here. l'll go check inside. Hey, come here! Call an ambulance quickly. He will die if we leave him like this. Make it fast! Hello? Ambulance service? Please come quickly to Highway Hotel, on the route to Masinagudi. Please, don't go there. You don't have to see it. Water! - Hey, he's the one! - Catch him! - Come. Constable, pick up that knife. Sir, let me explain.. Get into the car first. You can talk later. Hey, come! Nurse, put him on drips. The patient has been hurt badly in his stomach, Sir. He has to go through a surgery. Take him to the bigger hospital at Masinagudi. Before that, get his statement. Okay. John, how are you? What's the problem between you and that guy? lsn't he the one who stabbed you? Lock him inside!! How's the business going, John? Those guys still have respect only for money. How dare you take over my shop? Beat them up and chase them away! Move! Bro! Leave me.. Leave me, please! Leave! Run away from here! Team DrC Start the car! Mani, Sir! You can save me. Please help! l have a wife and two children.. Water.. Water.. Sir! Sign it. lf anything happens to him, you might have to come here again. Okay. You may leave. Key! l will drive. Team DrC What were you thinking when you sent me away alone? l was really scared last night. l didn't have the courage to leave you with them and go away. l could'vejust paid those 80 rupees and settled it. And l made a mess out of it. But our problem didn't start at the hotel, right? l know that this behaviour of mine is really troubling you. But l can't give any guarantee that l can change overnight. But still, l will try. When l go out of control, if you are with me, everything will be alright! So you have no plans of leaving me alone, huh? Team DrC Vivek Ranjit.
