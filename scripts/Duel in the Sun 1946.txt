Time cannot change its impassive face... nor dim the legend of the wild young lovers... who found heaven and hell in the shadows of the rock. For when the sun is low... and the cold wind blows across the desert... there are those of Indian blood... who still speak of Pearl Chavez... the half-breed girl from down along the border... and of the laughing outlaw... with whom she here kept a final rendezvous... never to be seen again. And this is what the legend says... A flower known nowhere else... grows from out of the desperate crags... where Pearl vanished... Pearl, who was herself a wild flower... sprung from the hard clay, quick to blossom... and early to die. Pearl. Where's your ma? She's in there, dancing. Like mother, like daughter. I'm commencing to think I like the daughter better. Let go! You go away from me, or I'll call my pa. That renegade creole squaw-man? That's a rich one. I'll just raise you fifty, Mr. Chavez. Would you mind? Mind what? That weed. I find it rather repulsive. Pretty fancy gentleman, ain't you, Mr. Chavez? He's not so fancy about his wife, if you ask me. Look at her. Quitting? Broke again? Yes, gentlemen... but there are greater tragedies... that I'm sure you wouldn't understand. Pa! Pa, will you take me in the Presidio? I ain't never been in there and... And you never should be. What are you doing out here at this hour anyway? I was just dancing. I've told your mother repeatedly... this street is no place for a girl your age. I didn't mean no harm. It's my fault, child, not yours. The sins of the fathers. Go home now, dear. I'll be back in a little while. Don't! Stop! No, Chavez! Don't! Don't! Don't! I beg you! Don't! Pa! I plead no mitigating circumstances. They deserved to die, as I deserve to die. For I long since killed a person... much superior to either of them... myself. I killed that person the day I gave my family's name... to the woman who became my wife. And since I believe... the punishment should fit the crime... I suggest that you hang me by the neck until I am dead. It's from Laura Belle. Did I ever tell you about her? She's my second cousin. Yes, Laura Belle is my second cousin... but she was more than that to me. You see, once upon a time, in a different age... in a different age and such a different world... I was in love. And wonderful to believe, the lady was in love with me. You mustn't look at me as though that were impossible. I was quite the looker in my day and very dashing. Perhaps a bit too dashing. And that's why this very wonderful girl... who might have been your mother, decided on security... and gave herself in wedlock to a wealthy yankee. Better make it fast, Chavez. You've only got five minutes left. No! No! They can't. They can't. I won't let them. Better that it end. Really it is. Your mother and I can't hurt you any longer. Laura Belle wants my little girl to go to her. Yes, just a few more weeks... and at last, you'll have a home... the mother you should have had. No, you mustn't leave me. You mustn't. You've been a good child. Through some miracle, you're good... and you're decent, and you're strong. And now you must prove that you are strong. You will do that for me, won't you, darling? No tears, no grief... now or later. Here. Keep this scarf. Wear it sometimes. Get her out of here, Chavez. Listen to me, darling. We've very little time. I want you to lean on Laura Belle... make her your inspiration and your guide. And then one day, you'll be the great lady... I've always wanted you to be. Promise me that. I promise. Cross your heart? Cross my heart. She'll love you. I know she will. And you must give her all the love you've had for me. Smile for me. Now, now. Head high. Strong. Very strong. All threats of hell and hopes of paradise... one thing at least is certain... this life flies. One thing is certain, and the rest is lies. The flower that once has bloomed forever dies. Ready, Chavez? Quite ready, sheriff. Whoa! I beg your pardon. You can't be... What's your name? None of your business. Sorry. I really am sorry. I wonder if I could... I don't talk to no strangers. That's a good rule generally, I grant you, but... in this case, it... Come on. Won't you answer just one question? What is it? Did you see a little southern tot... on the Guadalupe coach? No. Are you sure? She was traveling alone. You said "one question." I know, but it doesn't seem unreasonable if you... Now you go away and leave me alone. I know all about men like you. Well... Good morning. Why couldn't they have been a little more explicit... about just which coach they were sending her on? Don't worry, Jesse. I'll drive her out to the ranch whenever she shows up. Thanks, Lem. You can't miss her. She's one of those... well-brought-up southern children. Probably be hungry and crying her eyes out. I'll give her some milk and blow her nose for her. Thanks again. And... so long! So long. Give my regards to the old man. I will. Say hello to Laura Belle for me. Wait! Wait! Do you know somebody named Laura Belle? I said, do you know somebody named Laura Belle? None of your business. It is my business. I don't talk to no strangers. You can answer one question, can't you? That won't hurt you none. All right, one question. But remember, just one. I know all about girls like you. Don't you dare say that. Pearl. How'd you know my name? If you hadn't been so uppity... I'd have known who you were a long time ago. Now come on. Get in. Who are you? My mother couldn't come to meet you... so I came in her place. I'm Laura Belle's son... the older one, Jesse. There. I'm sorry about not recognizing you. I guess your clothes sort of fooled me. Don't misunderstand me. I think they're beautiful. You do? Yes, and very unusual. But you know... I think I'd like to see you in brighter colors. Like green? I have a green blouse. - Green, blue, yellow maybe. - Yellow? I have a real pretty yellow one right here. - I'll put it on now. - Not now. Save it for tomorrow. Here's where the ranch starts. There's the marker... the Spanish Bit... a million acres of McCanles empire. Empire? Isn't this still Texas? Yes, but the Senator doesn't always acknowledge that. Look. He puts his seal of ownership on everything. It's on his sons, too, I suppose. In fact, I'm sure my brother Lewt and I... are the Senator's favorite property. Is your brother as nice as you are? Girls in town think he's nicer. - Hiya, Jesse. - Howdy, Jake. Fine foals. Is that your house? That is the residence of Jackson Tilt McCanles and family. And on to the fortress... and happiness. Jesse! Pearl! Here you are. Prettiest girl ever to set foot on Spanish Bit. Pearl, dear. I'm so glad you've come to us, darling. Here, let me look at you. Yes, you're Scott's daughter. And now you're ours. You're just like he said. I'm afraid I'm somewhat different than he remembered. But come, dear. Did you take good care of her, Jesse? I showed her all the points of interest. - He did. He's nice. - I think so, too. You southern belles are all alike. Where in holleration you been all day? I just went down to Paradise Flats. - Senator, this is Pearl. - Who? Pearl Chavez, our cousin. You remember. We invited her to come and stay with us. Don't be scared. You're not a trespasser. She's no cousin of mine. She's Scott Chavez's daughter, ain't she? Yes, of course she is. Why don't you say so? Girl, what are you doing in that getup? Is that the latest fashion... with them aristocratic cousins of yours? Or is it what they're wearing this season in wigwams? Come on, boy. We got to talk business. See you later, Pearl. Come, dear. I'll take you to your room. He don't want me here. You mustn't mind the Senator. He doesn't mean anything by it. It's his way ever since... ever since his accident. Accident? It's a long story... and, I'm afraid, not a very pleasant one. I wish we had a better room for you... but later on, we'll speak to the Senator. Lewton, dear. This is Pearl. My youngest son... Lewton. Pleased to meet you, Lewton. Pleased to meet you... Pearl. Come, Pearl. You and Lewton will have plenty of time later on... to get to know one another. I'm sure we will. Yay... boy. Sounds of the rude world Heard in the day Lulled by the moonlight Have all passed away Beautiful dreamer Queen of my song List' while I woo thee... Where will I put your medicine, Mrs. McCanles? Leave it on the table. Mrs. McCanles, can I get married? But, Vashti, whom do you want to marry? Nobody in particular, ma'am. I just thought I'd kind of like to get married. Of course, Vashti. You may marry whenever you wish. Thank you, ma'am. Do you know anybody... who would be nice for me to marry? No, I don't, but I'll think about it. Thank you, ma'am. There's no particular hurry. That Vashti. I'm afraid I'll never be able to train her properly. And as to marriage... Sit down. I'm glad your father sent you to me. All you have to do is behave like a lady. Not that Scott Chavez's daughter... could ever be anything but a lady. I'm a good girl, ma'am. Of course you are, dear, but you see... you'll be the only young girl at Spanish Bit. No one could blame you... if your head were turned a little. You take Lewton, for instance. He's such an attractive boy. I think Jesse's much nicer. But you scarcely know Lewton. Of course, he's a bit undisciplined... but perhaps that's what gives westerners their charm. The Senator was like that. That's why, when your father... Jesse always chides me for talking about the past. I hope Jesse likes me. We're going to lose him someday. I've known that ever since he came back from law school. I've been so selfish. He'd have gone long ago if it weren't for me. My firstborn... he's so good. He's made such a difference in my life. - Ma'am? - Yes, Pearl? I'll be a good girl. I promise I will. I want to be like you. That's what my father wanted. I'm afraid neither your father nor I... found happiness, child. I hope you will. Come, child. This is no way to begin. Do you know this waltz? Will you stop that infernal instrument! King me, Senator. I always figured when I moved into my own quarters... I'd be rid of that noise. I guess that's it, Senator. I think I'll take me a little stroll. Now we got that papoose to put up with. I don't know. She looks like a pretty cute tamale to me. You think so? Wouldn't appeal to me none. Of course, I always liked my women more... Say, Senator. Yeah, Lewt? You know that last trip I took up to Abilene? Yeah. I was driving the herd all day and kind of tired... and felt like getting some relaxation. Yeah. Didn't happen to drop into a place... called the Last Chance, did you? How did you find that out? Sent them a check for 1,600 just yesterday. That's how I found out. I guess I had a few drinks too many. That's all right. A fella's got to sow some wild oats sometime. What's the money for? Senator... I hope someday I'll be like you. The only thing I don't like about you... is the miserable way you play poker. Trying to fill inside straights is a sucker's game. Go on, boy. Go on. Run along. What a boy. How'd they come to name you Pearl? I don't know, sir. Couldn't have had much eye for color, could they? They might better have called you Pocahontas or Minnehaha. Ain't that right? I guess so. All right, Minne, on your way. Good night, sir. Minne... ha ha. Ha ha. Hello, Pearl. What's the matter? Are you unhappy? Don't you like Spanish Bit? If everybody was like you. If everybody was like me, the world would be... a terribly frustrated sort of place. What do you mean? Nothing for you to worry your pretty little head about. I want to learn. Will you learn me? Your ma says you're a lawyer. I want to be a lady and know everything, like her. I wonder if learning ever made mother any happier. - I wish I could do that. - What? Make rings like that. Can I try? Let me try. No, Pearl. Now whoa. Ladies aren't supposed to smoke. Now you won't want to learn me things, will you? You don't like me no more, do you? Of course I do. I'm afraid a lot of men will want to learn you things. I think you better go to bed... like a good little girl. We'll discuss your education another time. All right. Good night, Pearl. Good night, Jesse. Good night. What do you want? I hate you! Don't you pretend nobody ever did that before. They didn't. Nobody did. Nobody's going to. You little... You leave that alone! I reckon he must be the white half. I forgot to say good night, ma'am. Sometimes I feel like a motherless child That ain't no ham, Miss Pearl. That's a pig. Same thing. But Mrs. McCanles, she's very particular... and she don't want no big pig listed like no little ham. Here. Maybe you better make the list, Vashti. No, ma'am. I can't write. Mrs. McCanles says to me once, "Vashti, can you write?" And I says, "Mrs. McCanles..." Vashti. Mrs. McCanles says to me once, "Vashti, can you write?" And I says, "Mrs. McCanles..." Vashti! Mrs. McCanles says... Vashti! That's Mr. Lewt. I think he wants to see me. Vashti, where are you? I'm scared of that Mr. Lewt. He says to me once, "Vashti, you're empty-headed." Vashti! Tell Miss Pearl to come out here. Miss Pearl... I heard him. Tell him I'm busy. Why don't you tell him... and I'll just run along up to the house? All right, I'll tell him. What do you want? Thought you might like to see some tricks. Watch this. That's a good boy. Hey, Lewt. What do you want? I thought you were supposed to be on the round-up today. And suppose you tend to your mortgages... and stop sticking your nose in my business. Just as one civilized man to another, l... if that isn't insulting you... I have a little suggestion to make. All right. Let's have it. Why don't you leave this one alone? She may do very nicely if given half a chance. What's the matter, judge? You got her earmarked for yourself? Hey, Pearl. Come on, Dice. Push. Whoa. Give me a good push. Whoa, boy. I want you to meet a lady. Now bow for the lady, Dice. He's right smart. What do you think of my new girl, Dice? Oh? Maybe not. Did you teach him all that? All that and lots more. He'll turn on a dime and give you change. - Do you want to try him? - Me ride him? You're just having fun with me. Or can't you ride bareback? - Of course I can. - Let me see you. I could show you, but I got work to do. Of course, if you don't dare, I don't give a doggone. Yeah? Get off him. Sure enough. He won't throw you. He's smooth as cream. Come on! Now git! Open the gate! You all right? That was a fool thing to say. You never rode bareback before in your life. I never said I had. Is she hurt, Lewt? No. Get out of here. Can we do anything? Go on and mosey, will you? Sure. You got gumption, but you ain't got no sense. If you'd only let me start him right... instead of scaring him that way. It wasn't him that was scared. He won't throw me next time. You better stick to buggy-riding. Maybe him and me ain't your style. Ain't no maybe about you. I wish you'd let me ride him some more. Sure. How'd you like me to give him to you? You mean for keeps? You're not just teasing? No. I guess you'd rather have Jesse... pick you out a riding horse... even if he don't know the difference... between a pinto and a strawberry roan. I like this one. And you like me, don't you, honey? You won't throw me no more. All right. He's yours. Let's you and me ride down to the sump after supper, huh? Where's that? A shady place over by Hidden Canyon. The water's good and deep now, almost over your head. You mean go swimming... together? I'll bring along my guitar, play us some music. You got a nerve. The moon will be pretty near full. You didn't buy me, just giving me a horse. I'll be waiting for you after supper out by the bell. I won't go. I won't! Listen to this for poppycock. "And the benefits to be derived... "by the small ranchers from the new railroad... "are too numerous to need recounting here." "Small ranchers." Ignorant, nasty, spoiling the open range... with their measly fences. And say, Jesse. I should have told you before. Them surveyors had the gall... to come traipsing over Spanish Bit... with them infernal spyglasses of theirs. I almost fired that new foreman Ken... for letting them on the place. Shouldn't have done that, Senator. Why not? Because it wasn't Ken who let them on the place. Nobody else would have had the nerve. I was the one that told them they could do it. - Have you gone plumb crazy? - I don't think so. I thought it might be a good idea to cooperate... and have the tracks where they'd do the most good. Good? What do you mean good? It's getting rather cool, don't you think? For one thing... the railroad will bring new people, a school. Paradise Flats will become a real town instead of... And that same railway will ship... a lot of emigrants from up north down here... and they'll start in voting and putting in taxes. It's your ranch. I was just trying to be helpful. Spanish Bit's going to belong to you someday... you and Lewt. So I don't see why you don't... Senator, I know you mean well for me. You've always been generous to us. Maybe Lewt and I would be closer to what you wanted us to be... if you hadn't been so generous. What's wrong with Lewt? Nothing at all that you'd object to. That's not the point. I'm the one who's the maverick. I don't know what you're talking about. I'd like one McCanles to give something to this state... and not just take from it. Good night, sir. Your son, ma'am? Yes, Senator. Who's there? Is that you, Jesse? Hello, Pearl. Nice night. Want to take a little walk? It's kind of late. I think I'd better go... Where were you going when l... Got to get me somebody to love I... I guess that's Lewt. Certainly is Lewt. He's the best serenader... this side of the Rio Grande. I don't care if he is. Him and his old guitar. Just because he gave me a horse. I know why, too. He can't fool me none. That's a horse on Lewt, isn't it? I didn't really want to meet him. Honest, I didn't. It was just that I was kind of lonesome and... I know. Do you still want me to take that walk with you? I don't know why not. Lewt can supply the charming musical background. Got to get me somebody to love I'll be... Thanks, Lewt. You're a better wrangler than all of them. Sid, see that chestnut over there? She looks lame. Take her out to pasture. Sure. It's hotter than a stove lid. Sure wish we was over at the sump right now. And somebody else figures the same way, I reckon. Looks like she's heading for a cool-off. - I'll see you later. - Where are you going, boss? - I got business. - That lucky stiff. I wish I was a McCanles. Good afternoon. How's that water? As cool as it looks? You go away from here. - Care for a swimming lesson? - No. What if I just stay around, keep you company? Don't you dare. I'm sorry, honey. I can't hear a word you say. Move over. You can't come in here. Just act like I'm not even here. Act like we never even met. You disappointed? If you ain't the lowest, dirtiest, meanest... Come on out. I ain't stopping you. I can't, with you there. Wait till it's plumb dark, for all I care. Let go! Let me down! Making me late for supper just to be mean! What will your ma think? If you hadn't been so doggone scared I'd see something... you'd have been home a long time ago. Little tiger cat. Evening, Pearl. Have a good swim? Let me through! Am I too late for supper? I mean, is everybody finished? Mrs. McCanles say anything? Yes, ma'am. She said, "Where's Miss Pearl?" And I said, "I don't know, Mrs. McCanles." And she said, "Where's Mr. Lewton?" And I said, "I don't know, ma'am." And she said, "Well..." Pearl, dearest. I was so worried about you. Sorry, ma'am. What happened? I went riding. With Lewton? Vashti, get Miss Pearl some supper. Yes, ma'am. The Senator's got rules about supper. He says to me, "Don't you ever..." - Vashti. - Yes, ma'am. Did you go riding with Lewton? No, ma'am... I didn't go riding with Lewton. He wasn't here for supper either. He's coming. But he wasn't with you? We just happened to meet up. I see. But why is your hair wet? I was down to the sump. You went in swimming? Yes, ma'am. With Lewton? No, ma'am. I didn't, ma'am. Honest, I didn't. I didn't, ma'am. All right, Pearl. L... Evening, ma. Good evening, Lewton. Sorry to be late. We were down to the sump. I think I'll take a ride over to El Paso tomorrow... and get me a little fun and relaxation. Anything I can bring you, ma? No, thank you. Pearl, I think I'll try to get you one... of them newfangled bathing suits. She swims real well, ma. Where'd you learn? Oh, my dear! You... you varmint! What you getting your bristles up about? Giddy! Miss Pearl, wake up. What is it? What's the matter? Well... What time is it? It must have been about 9:00... when Mrs. McCanles says to me, "Vashti... "when Mr. Jubal Crabby gets here..." What is it? Who's Mr. Crabby? Why did you wake me up? I almost forgot. Mrs. McCanles wants to see you up in the sitting room. Maybe you better hurry. She's been a-waiting. I didn't know where you was... so I said, "I'll go see Mr. Lewton." And he said... Why are you so slow? I don't rightly know... exceptin' I always have so much to remember. This is the child, Jubal. Of course, she isn't dressed quite properly, but... Close the door, Pearl. This is Mr. Crabby. We have no minister in these parts, but... A man doesn't have to wear the cloth to be a sinkiller. I know that. That's why I was so anxious... to have you talk to the child. Come here, girl. You call her a child? Under that heathen blanket... there's a full-blossomed woman... built by the devil to drive men crazy! You mustn't frighten her. I'm sure she only needs a little guidance. Guidance she needs, and guidance she'll get... or I ain't been the sinkiller... from here to El Paso for thirty years. Sit down, girl. You could be a woman of sin or a woman of God. Which is it to be? I want to be a good girl. Then remember that the devil's always able to hog-tie you. Sometimes he comes ghosting over the plains... in the shape of a sneaking rustler... and sometimes... begging your pardon, Laura Belle... he stakes out the home... to the worthy and the God-fearing. You're curved in the flesh of temptation. Resisting is gonna be a darn sight harder for you... than for females protected by the shape of sows. Yes, sirree, bob, you've got to sweeten yourself with prayer. Pray till you sweat... and you'll save yourself eternal hellfire. - Do you understand me, girl? - Yes, sir. Then on your knees. Now I'm gonna start you toward salvation. O Lord, look upon this, thy creature. She's a weak vessel and a pauper, as thou knowest. But she wants to be thy handmaiden. Give her the horse sense not to go wandering off... in the tulies with worthless cowpokes. Amen. Rise, girl. Here. I want you to take this. It's a hallowed medal, and a good one. I took it off a thieving card sharper... but first I shrived him... and sent him to the pearly gates... as nice and pretty as any from his own faith could have done. You wear it, girl. Thank you, sir. Part Indian, ain't you? Those ancestors of yours will be spinning like tops... when they know you got this on. Just the same, it'll keep you... sweet and clean as the first milking. Won't get you into heaven... but it will comfort you on the way there. That is, if you use it right. Laura Belle, don't you think... we ought to be saying a few words of prayer... for them worthless cowpokes? I got a feeling they'll be needing... consolation. On your knees again, girl. O Lord, have mercy on all men, young and old alike... who gaze upon this, thy regained servant. Amen. Senator! Where's the Senator? What's up? - Senator McCanles! - What's the stampede? There's a great big railway gang down close to the east fence. How close? They say they're coming across Spanish Bit line this afternoon. - What will we do? - Get ahold of Lewt and Jesse. Lewt's not back from El Paso. Holleration. I guess Jesse and me... can handle it all right. - Sid. - Yes, Senator? Listen carefully now. Sound every bell from here to Blue Hills ranch. I want every wrangler, every cowhand... every man and boy on Spanish Bit... down there at the east fence, and I want them there fast. - Yes, sir. - And Sid. - Yes, sir? - I want them there armed. You betcha. I don't like this, Mr. Langford. It's your railroad, and it's your headache... but I still don't like it. What do you mean, you don't like it? You told me we were legally in the clear, didn't you? Yeah, and I know you asked the army for help, too. And I hope they don't come. And I hope we don't need them. What do you mean? I mean Jackson McCanles don't scare so easy. We roamed the plains together. We fought at Vicksburg together. And if he gives up in this fight... he ain't the man I've known for fifty years. I wish you wouldn't try to ride, father. You think I'm going to sit in this house... like some old woman? Lift me on that horse. If they want war, they can have it. - Ken. - Yes, sir? Strap me on here. Come on. I aim to defend Spanish Bit with lead. If there's any yellow-bellies among you, get out now. Are you with me? All right, then. Spread out in a line... from the west marker to Pinto Point. Come on! Kind of thought he wouldn't take this lying down. Looks like they mean business. Smoot! Lem Smoot, I thought you had more sense than this. Yeah? Since when did you ever know me to dodge a fight? You know I'm lawyer for the railroad... Never mind that stuff. Who's the dude? Langford is the high mucky-muck on the railway. Heard a lot about you, Senator. Glad to make your acquaintance. Can't say the same, thank you kindly. You better tell those hired thieves of yours... to pick up their tools... and fast, if you know what's good for you. We have the law on our side. If you had come into court when I asked you to... this land might not have been... Never mind that fancy legal talk. There's my law right there. Have you a copy of the writ with you, Smoot? What's the sense of... All right. Are you our lawyer, or aren't you? - Now read it to him. - Save your breath. "From the people of the sovereign state of Texas... "to Jackson Tilt McCanles, greetings." "Greetings." Ain't that nice? Jackson. You and I fought to build this state of Texas... and I aim to see these men perform their duties... peacefully and as authorized. Is that so? I'm gonna shoot any trespasser that comes on my property. If you don't like that, you can lump it... you and the state of Texas. Just a minute. May I speak to you privately? Say what you got to say right here and now. I'm sorry, father... but I'm afraid you're in the wrong. I ain't aiming to let you settle that. You mean to shoot down unarmed men? Just like they was rattlesnakes if they cross this line. In that case, Senator... Get me a pair of wire cutters. Ferguson. So that's where you stand. Think I'd rather be on the side... of the victims than of the murderers. Jesse, I'm warning you. We're going to fire on those coolies... the moment you cut those wires. Their blood will be on your hands. Jesse, I'm asking you for the last time. Column left. Ho! Thank God. Column left. Ho! Right front into lines. Ho! I once fought for that flag. I'll not fire on it. Sid, tell those men to get back to their work. Yes, sir. Father, l... Get out of my sight... and stay away from Spanish Bit as long as I live. Whoa, General! Hey! Whoa, boy! Get me out of here! Hey, get me out of here! Get me out of this! Unbuckle him! Are you all right, father? Leave me be, you Judas. Here. Fours left, column left. Gallop. Ho! Hiya. Afternoon, Mr. Lewton. Where the devil is everybody? The place is deserted. I don't rightly know... exceptin' that the Senator went riding. The senator went riding? You must be going out of your mind. No, sir. He went riding with lots and lots of other men. And I heard they're having a kind of a meeting. What kind of a meeting? I don't rightly know, but I said to Mrs. McCanles... "Mrs. McCanles, where are all those men going?" And she said... Never mind. She did say... "Vashti, go right on about your business. "Right on about your business." I guess this means good-bye for a while. Now, don't you cry. I'll be back before long... and he'll get over it when the railroad comes through. I always knew you'd have to leave someday... but now that it's come, I just can't bear it. It's not as bad as all that. I'll get a place in Austin. You can come visit me. If you're a good girl, I might even take you... on a little trip to New Orleans. No. He'd never forgive me. I'll never see you again. Never. I know it. He said he'd shoot you if you ever step foot on... One McCanles can be just as tough as another. Mrs. McCanles, come in here! You better go to him now. But you won't go yet awhile? No. I'll just pack my things and say good-bye to Pearl. Are you there? Jesse, go away, please. What you scared of, Pearl, honey? Come on in. Thanks for knocking. I didn't used to think... there was much to all those fancy manners of yours... but I guess I was wrong. Jesse, I... Forgive me for intruding, Pearl. You, too, Lewt. Good-bye, Pearl. Wait a minute, please! I didn't mean to... It's all right. I understand perfectly. No, you don't. - Where are you going? - I'm going to Austin. You gonna be gone long? Quite long, I'm afraid. It isn't because of... No. Bless your heart. I'm leaving by request... the Senator's request. Going away, Jesse? Uh-huh. Your dream's come true. I'm going away. It's gonna seem kind of lonely around here... without the judge, ain't it, Pearl? Yes, it is. Don't see how we'll know... when we're doing right and when we're doing wrong. You surprise me. First time I knew... you were interested in ethics. I'm sure you folks will excuse me. You must have a lot of things you want to talk over. The nights are long, oh, so long It is going to be lonesome without you. I just don't know how I can stand it. You seem to be doing all right. I'm sorry. That was mean of me. I couldn't help it. You just can't go away believing... I tried hard. Honest, I did. I know. Lewt's hard to resist. No! I hate him! I know what you're thinking. I guess I'm just... trash, like my ma. You mustn't believe that. It was Lewt's fault. You needed some help. I did. I needed you to help me. I might as well say it. I loved you. Somehow you touched me. You... love me? I thought of what you'd be like when you grew up a little. I didn't know. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't think it would be fair to tell you. I was a fool. I came to your room to say good-bye... to tell you that someday I'd be back for you... that I'd think about you and that I'd write... I'll write to you. You will? If you need me, I'll come back, Senator or no Senator. And you'll forget about... about tonight, won't you? You'll forget it? No, I don't think I'll forget. I don't think I'll ever be able to. I shouldn't have told you the way I felt. It wasn't fair. There I go again, trying to be fair. Trash. I hear you turned out to be... a prize yellow dog down at the fence line. I should have done that to you years ago. Nights are long, oh, so long On the prairie Got to get me somebody to love The dirty skunk! All right, Jesse. You said you'd never forget. This the other one you meant, Lewt? You don't like this, but you're gonna get it... right over the head if you don't settle down. What's the matter? You having trouble? Back, you killer! Back! Here, Ed. Don't pick up that halter! He'll charge you! You're scared of him, and he knows it. Never run from him. Stand your ground. Come on, boy. I got a nice leather bonnet for you. Easy, boy. Be careful. - He's just plumb crazy! - Don't you worry none about him. Look out! Watch his feet! He's got his ear. Ear him down! Dig 'em deep. That'll stop him. You got him. Nobody could have done it but you. That's all there is to it. Just don't let him bluff you. You see, there ain't nothing to handling stallions. It just takes a little know-how. You sure got nerve. Get away, Ed. You're the boss. What? You don't have to stay around here anymore, do you? Don't never have to do nothing. I stay around here because I like it. Bet you I can hit that ding-dong straight off. Who cares? What's up? Nothing. Just practicing. Can you shoot? Sure. It's easy. That's what you said about bareback riding. All right, I'll show you. Better not try it. You might hit Ken... or the mare, more likely. Sure is doggone hot. Sure is. You know what I'd like to do? What? I'd like to take a swim. You mean it? Sure, I mean it. Let's go to the sump. I don't mind if I do. Am I your girl? Of course you're my girl. Then we can be married, can't we? I guess so. No. If I'm not good enough to marry... I'm not good enough to kiss. Come here, you bobtailed little tree cat. We're bespoken, ain't we? It wouldn't do no harm to tell folks, would it? Sure, we'll tell them. Can we tell them soon? Can we tell them Saturday at the barbecue? Sure, we can. Why not? What you got here? Something the sinkiller gave me. He said it would keep me... sweet and clean as the first milking. Who cares about milking? I don't want no milkmaid. Don't you get awful tired eating just beef? Wish we could get an eighty-hour week. Yeah. Me, too. Kind of miss Jesse around here. Don't you? Jesse? Better not mention his name on Spanish Bit. Can't get over Lem Smoot joining those railroad people. I always say, if you can't whip them, join them. Never saw so many crows... around here before in all my life. Wish they'd learn to grow corn without husks. Wouldn't surprise me none if that Indian girl... didn't up and massacre the whole dern lot of them. When I'm married... I'm gonna have lots and lots of parties. But who would do all the work when I gives my party? I likes fishing better than I does dancing. You never go fishing. I never goes dancing neither. The gals to the center and ring to the left. The boys shake hands and go to the right. Now weave a basket. Circle left. Now we'll weave that basket the other way. Senator, they appreciate it very much. I try to show my people a good time, eh, Lewt? You bet your boots, Senator. Now, birdie in the center and seven hands around. Bird hop out, and the crow hop in. She around the she, and the he around the he. The he around the she, and the she around the he. Four hands up, and here we go. Hurry up, boys, and don't be slow. 'Cause you'll never get your love if you don't do so. Pearl, dear, I've been looking all over for you. You should be downstairs. It's very rude. I'm sorry. I was fixing my hair the way you told me to. Do I look all right, ma'am? You're the prettiest girl at the party. Here, dear. Wear this. You're so kind to me... this dress and everything. Come, dear. Oh, ma'am! What's the matter? It's nothing. Let's go. Balance your partners, and two ladies cross You cross to that cowboy so true I sure love being here, Mr. McCanles. Fine. There he is. Lewt, come here. You call me, Senator? Yeah. Wheel me in there. Come on, boy. Come on. Something wrong, Senator? Close the door. So this is where that squaw lives, huh? Scott Chavez. I've been meaning to speak to you, Senator. I think we ought to kind of fix it up... Too good for her, if you ask me. - She's all right, Senator. - She's all right, huh? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I've been watching you... making calf's eyes at that half-breed. Have you lost your mind? I don't understand you, pa. You want me to have a good time, don't you? Sure. Is that all you got in mind? Of course. I ain't been working thirty years on this place... to turn it into no Indian reservation. You know me better than that. - Is that right, son? - Yeah, sure. You had me worried for a time, boy. - Shove me out of here. - All right. Yes, a little relaxation is mighty pleasant... after a man's been chasing Satan all the way from here to Austin. Yes, sirree, bob. You've been to Austin? Did you hear anything of Jesse? I heard plenty. Enough to warm the cockles of your gentle heart. You know what they're saying? He'll be governor of the whole dern state... before he's ready to meet his maker. I knew it. Do you think it's true? Judging from the fancy office he's got already, it's true. Has a rolltop desk and a gold spittoon... you couldn't miss if you aimed from here. I hope he isn't working too hard. I shouldn't fret too much about that... not while old man Langford's daughter... is as sweet and pretty... as the sunrise on the mesa, I wouldn't. Yes. He wrote me about her. He says she's a lovely girl. If wedlock's his aim... he couldn't shoot at a neater target. What are you looking so sad about, Pearl? This is a party. Come on. Let's show these cowpokes a thing or two about dancing. Girl, where's that medal I gave you? I... She loaned it to me. I'm trying to get... one just like it made for myself. Good. Good! Put your left foot, put your left foot Put your left foot just so Put your left foot, put your left foot Put your left foot just so Take a step to the side, take a step to... Come on, honey. Don't let them yokels laugh at you. But I don't know how. It's easy. Just follow me. Now you're doing it. Won't they be surprised when they hear about us? When they hear what about us? That we're bespoken, of course. Oh, that. But that's what you said. You said we'd tell them tonight. Just as everything is going good... you got to go and start all that again. Either you tell people we're bespoken, or I will. I want to tell you something... you don't fool me none no more. Will you stop poking up and vexing me? I don't know how a man stands it, the way you go on. You think you don't have to marry me. Maybe you don't. And you don't have to go on... lying to me no more neither. I made up my mind. You made up your mind about what? Just like I said... if you won't marry me, I'll get out. I'll go away as fast as I can. You can go and keep going for all I care. Go find yourself somebody else to pester. But don't you care? No woman can tie onto me like that... least of all a bobtail little half-breed like you. All righty. Thanks for letting me know... how you think about me. El Paso and Amarillo ain't no different... than Sodom and Gomorra... on a smaller scale, of course, but... What in Beezelbub's name do you call that? I wasn't having a very good time at the party neither. I was just kind of tired. Who are you? I'm the new straw boss around here. Name's Pierce. Sam to my friends. Mind if I sit down? If you want. Must be plenty tiring on a person, all that dancing. - Don't you dance? - No, ma'am. Somehow, I never got the chance to learn. You ought to. It's fun. Lots of folks seem to think so. How would you like to learn tonight? What? Do you mean you'd teach me? I ain't so good at them fancy dances myself... but we could learn together, if you want. - I'd be right honored. - Then come on. Come on! The next dance will be ladies choice. The ladies choose the gents. Gents line up over on this side... ladies over yonder. Now, ladies, this is your big chance. And don't be afraid to go after the true love of your choice. I'd rather play me some poker. Females shouldn't be allowed no choice. It ain't decent. I'll bet you six bits that fat one grabs me. You leave Jake alone. You had him all evening. Of all the nerve! When I stomp my heels three times... run for the gent of your choice. Ready? One, two... scat! I want you to get acquainted with little Lewt... the longest-legged critter this side of the main house. He's so cute! A lot cuter than big Lewt. He's just like silk. There you are, ma. Want to see the others? Yes. And I'm gonna help you take care of them, too. Sure, you are. Ain't they wonderful, these babies? Any kind of babies. They sure are. I remember reading something once when I was a kid. What? You'd think I was silly... a big galoot like me spouting poetry. No, Sam. Please. I'm going to sit right here until you tell me. It goes something like this. For everything created in the bounds of earth and sky... has such longing to be mated. It must couple or must die. That's the best poem I ever heard. I'm glad you like it. You married? Nope. Never run across anybody I wanted to marry. Besides, I never got up nerve enough to ask anybody. I guess you must be getting pretty old. Yep. Old enough to be your father... and then some. Why? Nothing. I guess, just the same... there are plenty of women who would marry you anyway. I better be getting home. Mrs. McCanles is kind of ailing. You wouldn't marry me, would you? - What did you say? - I said, would you marry me? Don't get mad, please. First time in my life I got up some nerve. How could a big galoot... Don't say that. You don't know about me. If you did, you wouldn't ask. You mean about Lewt? So you know about me and Lewt, too? Yeah, I guess ain't nobody don't know. I've knocked around plenty... - I'm trash, I tell you. - Don't go telling me that. I'd kill the first man who said anything like that. But I don't love you. Don't that matter? You've only known me a little while. I know I'm not something girls dream about... like the McCanleses. - I'm not rich like them either. - It ain't that. But I'd love you, and I'd take care of you. I got a little money saved. Get a little ranch of our own, maybe. Won't you even think about it, honey? Please, honey. Don't you call me "honey." Lewt called me that. You're all alike! Coming? I hope I didn't say nothing to hurt your feelings. That's all right. I'll marry you if you still want me to. You mean it? I declare. I never saw... so many cows before in all my life. I'm afraid they're not all cows, Helen. Sometimes, my dear, I think... that I didn't bring you up properly. All right. I understand. All I need is a hint. Those steers are from Spanish Bit. I thought your father's ranch was hundreds of miles from here. See? There's the brand. They're on their way to market. If it ain't the big railroad man. How's everything at the Bit? Getting along just fine since you left... Mr. McCanles. Same old Sid. I'll be inside, darling. Come, father. Hey, that Langford's daughter? Heard you were kind of sweet on her. Yes, that's Miss Langford. Pretty, ain't she? We could use a few like her around the ranch... especially now that Pearl's going... maybe. What do you mean? Darnest thing you ever heard. She's getting married. Can you imagine anybody marrying Pearl? Is she marrying Lewt? Lewt? What would Lewt... Nah, she's marrying Sam Pierce. Pearl ought to be very happy with Sam. She ain't marrying him yet. She ain't marrying nobody... until Lewt decides to give the bride away. So long, Judas. Can't say I like... your Spanish Bit people very much, if he's any criteria. Darling, I've been thinking. Why couldn't there be a spur track right on Spanish Bit? Then they could just ship the cattle... instead of driving them all that distance. You're not even listening to me, dear. Certainly I am. You were saying... You were asking if... What were you saying? I was trying to prove... what a helpful wife I'm going to be. Give me a kiss. I couldn't help overhearing. What? You liked that girl, didn't you? You still like her? I'm sure I'll always be devoted to her. Hope you'll like her, too. But you were in love with her, weren't you? Yes, I was in love with her. I said I was. Jesse. Father. Sometimes I think he didn't bring you up properly. What were you worried about when I came out just now? Worried? I was just wondering what my brother Lewt might do. Zeke, where's my peppermint and soda? Coming up now. Hear you named the day. That's right. Ring just come in the last post. Mighty pretty. Yep. You sure are shot full of luck. I'd like to stand the drinks for everybody. I'm getting married in the morning. That's fine. Save your money, Pierce. So you figure you got yourself a wife. I don't figure. I know I have. Think you can keep her? Reckon as how I can. Cattle rustlers and women rustlers. Both of them steal... what's got another man's brand on it. I don't think I like the way you're talking. Maybe I didn't rightly understand you. Yeah, you understand me all right. Pearl Chavez is my girl, and she'll always be my girl... just as long as I want her to be. From now you, you're gonna respect Pearl's name. If that ain't the best joke yet. He's defending the lady's name... my girl's name. Has anybody else around here... got any fancy ideas about Pearl Chavez? Don't seem to be no takers. I don't rightly know much about Sam Pierce, O Lord... but from what I hear... he'll be needing no introduction to you. Seeing as how Sam was snatched from his loved ones' arms... before they even had time to get a good grip on him... I'm counting on you to give him a better break up yonder. Hey, you hatchet face! Are you so almighty hungry to hang one man... that you can't wait till we get through planting this one? Now I be consigning him to your keeping. And I'm guessing you'll find him... the gentlest, sweetest straw boss... ever to enter the pearly gates. Amen. Start shoveling, cowpokes. It's our fault. We raised him wild. If he'd only gone to school, like Jesse. I thought I asked you never to mention Jesse's name again. It's true. You spoiled Lewt, and I let you. Ever since he was a child... he thought rules weren't made for him. He thought you made the rules, all of them... not just those for Spanish Bit. It's that Indian girl. If you hadn't brought her here... none of this would have happened. Perhaps if your attitude toward her had been different... It's my fault, huh? It's my fault. You dared to bring that Indian baggage... right here into this house, and now you try to tell me... You get her out of here. And what's more, get her out of here tonight! You've screamed at me for the last time. You made one of your sons hate you and sent him away. You made the other one a... murderer. Pearl will stay here just as long as I do. Here's the money. You better clear out of here... until this thing blows over. Thanks, pa. It's gonna take plenty of fixing. So you better stay away from here... until I send you the word. It'll take a year maybe. Maybe more than that even. I'm sorry to cause you all this trouble. If you get me out of this one... Never mind that. I ain't counting on no reformation. Go on. Get going fast. Good-bye, pa. So long, Sid. So long, Lewt. Take care of yourself, son. I will, pa. Yay, boy. Now here's a chance to do something for pa. I've been working on the railroad All the live-long day Come on, Sid. Come on. You ain't got the mint on this game. Sorry, Senator. You certainly stuck your head in a noose that time. Pearl, honey. What you doing with that thing? There ain't nobody here but me. I'm gonna kill you. That wouldn't be a very ladylike thing to do, would it... after me riding thirty miles just for a kiss? You're gonna get what you gave Sam Pierce. That just goes to show you... there ain't no gratitude for nothing. If it wasn't for me, you'd be tied up... with that brokendown cowhand right now. You might as well marry pa. Sam Pierce was a good man, and you're a skunk. Of all the ornery females. One minute you're yammering... because I don't love you enough... and when I go out and show you how much I do... you're wanting to plug me. You're my girl, honey. I was your girl. Anybody who was my girl is still my girl. That's the kind of guy I am. You know... loyal. Stay back. There ain't nobody gonna take my girl. Nobody. Never. I'm saving you, tiger cat. Just when I figure I'm doing fine and dandy... I start thinking about you, and nothing else is any good. Here. What's going on around here? Come in. Howdy, Senator. Sorry to be busting in on you like this. It's all right, sheriff. How's tricks? How's the law-breaking business? Pretty quiet... since Lewt left. Yeah, pretty dull without him around. Ain't heard from him lately, have you, Senator? Lewt? Here. Have a bite. Don't mind if I do. Wish I could afford this brand. The next batch I get, I'll send you some. No, I ain't heard a word from Lewt... since he was attacked by that no-account Sam Pierce. How's your other son feel about it? I ain't got no other son. Funny thing... one of the boys... Lewt? I wish it was so. Don't mind if I have a look around, do you? No. Go ahead, sheriff. You got your duties to do. I'm sorry you're gonna have your trouble for nothing. I hear Mrs. McCanles has been feeling kind of poorly. It ain't nothing. Just getting a little old, I guess. You reckon the missus would mind... if I kind of looked around her room? No. Why should she mind? Go ahead. Sid, ain't you moved yet? Come in. - Evening, ma'am. - Sheriff. Sorry to disturb your privacy, ma'am. Sheriff Thompson, what is it? It's really nothing, ma'am. One of the boys had a fool notion... that Lewt was around here. I'm afraid if Lewton were around... I'd be the last person to know it. Sorry. Oh, my sons. My sons. Let's try this one. Who's that? Is that you, girl? What do you want? It's me... Sheriff Thompson. You ain't seen Lewt, have you? Lewt? That murdering, sneaking no-account. I wish I could see him. I reckon you do. I was forgetting about Sam Pierce. Sorry. Good night. See you at the hanging. Poor old Mac. He don't know how close he came to getting plugged. Be quiet. It ain't safe yet. It ain't safe for them, you mean. There they go now. I think I'll light out for Mexico. Mexico? Yeah. I'm gonna grab me a ranch... that'll make this place look like a gopher hole. It would be like heaven, being in Mexico together. I'll show these heel-squatters around here... a thing or two about ranching. You can do it, too. - Lewt. - Huh? - Go saddle my pinto. - What for? - While I get ready. - Ready for what? I'm going with you, of course. Hurry up. You wouldn't like it down there, honey. Sure, I will. I'll be a big help to you, too. I can cook, and I can shoot as good as you... and I never get tired riding. You'll try to stop me from doing things... yammering about me maybe getting shot... or start all over again about marrying somebody. No. I promise I won't never say another word about marrying. You'll probably want to go with me... every time I feel like going on a bust... or playing me some poker. I wouldn't, honest. Just so long as I could be near you. I'm gonna live my own way. Nobody's gonna hog-tie me. Please. I'll come back every once in a while... and see you, like tonight. I'll do anything you say. Honey, I love you. I'll see you every time I come back. I'll send for you someday. Honest I will. I want to go with you. I've got to go with you. Will you stop your yammering? I've got to mosey! You love me! You said you loved me! Nobody else can have me because I'm yours! I don't want anybody else! I want you! I'm yours! Nobody else can have me! You said nobody ever! Now take me with you! You've got to take me! Please! Please, honey! - Shut up! - Lewt, honey, please! Begging your pardon, ma'am... I'd like to say all us boys at the Bit... is praying mighty hard that you get... All right, Ken. All right now. You just wait downstairs. I'll let you know when I need you. Will you thank the boys for me? Tell them it isn't quite as hard to go... as they may think. What are you talking that way for? Anybody would think you was dying. I'm a nuisance to you even to the end. It's the first time you've been in this room... since that night. Don't bring that up. I never had the courage to discuss it with you before... but it doesn't matter now. I've paid for my mistake. You've hated me all through the years. You paid? What about me, with these legs? As useless as a hog-tied steer. And all because you couldn't stand to be... mistress of the biggest ranch in Texas. And why? I'll tell you why. Nobody needed to tell me... who you was running away to that night. Nobody needed to tell me you was running to Chavez. That's not true. It's not true. I was running away, but not to Scott. Not to Scott. True or not, you left me. And true or not, I went after you... like any lovesick, half-baked boy would do. I'd give anything... anything to undo it. I loved you, Laura Belle. Yes, sir, I loved you. Kept on saying to myself all through the years... that I hated you, until finally I did hate you. In my heart, I knew all the time... it wasn't your fault, though. It was my fault. It was my jealousy that made me like I was... hard and cruel-like... till I guess you had to leave me. I never should have gone out after you that night. But when I found out you was gone... I got to thinking you was going to him... and I couldn't stand it. I swore I'd stop you and bring you back. I went crazy. Yes, that's what it was. I just went crazy. And I rode through the night like a drunken Comanche. It was my own crazy jealousy that threw me off that horse. Jackson, forgive me. Look at me. You're my husband... my very own. Hiya, boys. - It's Jesse. - Well, I'll be. He's got a lot of gall, coming back here. Where do you think you're going? I thought I told you to keep out of my sight. I just found out my mother is dying... and I came to see her, and I intend to see her. They tell me you're the big noise now... with them trespassing thieves. I hope my good fortune doesn't distress you too much. They're even talking about putting you... up for public office. They must pay high for double-crossers. Senator, let's not discuss that. I'm afraid we see things differently. Nothing on earth would bring me here... You're mighty lucky my men didn't take a shot at you. That was their orders. I was about to say that nothing on earth... would bring me back here except mother. Is she in her room? - No, she ain't in her room. - Where is she? You'll find her right in there, in a long pine box. Hello, Vashti. - Mr. Jesse... - No, thank you. But Mrs. McCanles, she said to me once... "Vashti, you be sure and see that Mr. Jesse eats proper..." You've been a good friend. I shan't forget it. Poor Mrs. McCanles. I wonder if Miss Pearl would mind if you woke her up. I have to go away soon. I would like to see her. What's the matter? Didn't you hear me? Yes, I heared you. Only I'm certain sure the devil hisself... has been chasing Miss Pearl. What on earth are you talking about? Mrs. McCanles, she treated Miss Pearl awful good. She treated everybody awful good, even me. And after she went to heaven... Miss Pearl looks like she's had a spell or something. She wouldn't eat nothing. She wouldn't talk to nobody. She just stared and stared... at Mrs. McCanles lying there so still-like. She ran to the barn... and wouldn't come out for nobody. Poor Pearl. She's sad. I listened at the barn door... and I heared her weeping something awful. I want you to do something for me. Yes? Go and fix Miss Pearl a hot breakfast. Yes! And I want you to pack Miss Pearl's things. Yes, ma'am! Yes, sir! Go away. Vashti said you wouldn't come into the house... and I couldn't believe her. Leave me alone. Have you gone out of your mind? What are you doing out here in the stable? I bet your pa would think it was too good for me. Never mind what he thinks. I'm not going to allow you... Don't you worry none about me. I'm going away from here. - Really? Where are you going? - It ain't your business. Me and Dice will get along all right. Of course, there's Lewt. He'll be paying a visit here... sooner or later, if I know Lewt. That's right, I'm Lewt's girl. You can't forget that, can you? What makes you think that? That's what you said that night. You said you'd never forget it. I did say that, didn't I? It worried me sometimes to think I'd made so much of it. I hope it didn't make any difference. It didn't make no difference. You're right. I'm Lewt's girl. It's all I ever was. It's all I ever could be. You love him, don't you? Love him? I hate him. I wish they'd hang him. I wish they'd hang him fast. Yes. After all you've been through, I suppose... It ain't just his fault. If he sent for me tonight, I guess I'd go to him. Lewt's not sending for you tonight or any other night. Listen, I have to be in Paradise Flats... a few days on business. Do you want to wait here until I go to Austin... or would you like to come with me right now? Me? You're just being sorry for me. You don't have to be sorry for me none! Listen to me. I won't have you thinking that. It's you who are feeling sorry for yourself. I told Helen long ago I wanted to get you out of here. You told her? Yes. She wants to be your friend. After your ma died... I just didn't want to go on living no more. I know what you mean. You'll like Helen, and she'll like you, too. You just wait and see. She's a lady, ain't she? Like your ma. She's a lady, like you're going to be. No, I can't be no more. Of course you can. We'll just pretend... the whole thing was just a bad dream. That's all it was actually, a nightmare. If only I could be good again! Look at me. Remember when you wanted to learn... when you wanted me to help you? I know just the school for you. School? What's the matter? Don't you still want to learn? I'll do anything. I'll cook for you. I'll wash Miss Helen's clothes. You'll do nothing of the sort. You'll learn to waltz and make small talk... and have pretty dresses. Here. For me? From mother to you. Jesse, I... I wish... I wish I could die for you. Let's hope you never have to do that. Is that you, Judas? I got a message from your brother... the McCanles with the guts. What's the matter with the bad man? Can't he deliver his messages in person? He has some business tonight... with a train. He just plumb don't like trains. So I've heard. Have you become his assistant? We keep in touch with each other. You should have seen his face... when I told him you have Chavez with you. I bet it was a lovely sight to behold. What's the message? He says I'm to bring her back with me... pronto. Suppose she doesn't feel up to making the trip? He says if she don't come back... he's coming here tomorrow morning... bright and early and get her. You seem to be a capable messenger. Would you mind carrying back a reply? Not at all. Glad to oblige. You can tell my beloved brother that I'll wait for him here. I should have the sheriff waiting for him... but I prefer to meet him alone. - Is that a promise? - You're not talking to Lewt. That's near enough. I'm giving you one more chance. Send Pearl out here... or I'll plug you from here to breakfast. Just what do you think Pearl's doing here with me? Don't give me any... of your high and mighty noble talk, big words. You think I wouldn't shoot you because you ain't got a gun? I wouldn't credit you with any such compunctions. I'm riding back to that hitching post... and then turning and starting to shoot. It's more than you did for Sam Pierce. Why all the consideration? Just don't want them fancy friends of yours... to say you had a brother who shot you down in cold blood. You're going to hang. You're going to hang by the neck until you're dead! You'll just go on killing and killing... till they kill you. I hope Pearl gives you a pretty funeral. - Who's that? - Just me... Lem Smoot. Come here to gloat over me, huh? You can turn right around and get out of here. I came because I thought maybe you'd be needing a friend. There's a funny glow in the sky tonight, ain't there? I remember once hearing one of them Indian legends... about how their ancestors lit bonfires in the sky... when a chief's son was a-dyin'. He's dying? It don't surprise me none. Lewt always was a good shot. It looks like them ancestors of yours... have to put out those bonfires. What do you mean? I guess Jesse's a little tougher than you thought. Thank God. I thought I knew you better than that. I know how fond you were of those boys... and how proud of them you were. It don't seem possible... but I must have been wrong about a whole lot of things. Laura Belle warned me I was spoiling Lewt... but I wouldn't listen to her. Look. You see them plains and hills? I was so almighty proud... of what I carved out of this country. I figured I was building something... for Lewt and Jesse. And what have I got now? Lewt a murderer, an outlaw. Jesse... Jesse would come back any time you want him to. You think so? He told me to tell you so. I'm just a lonely old man who needs a friend... like you said. Whoa! Here's your luggage, miss. You're Miss Helen, ain't you? And you're Pearl. He's been asking for you. How is he? He's... gonna be all right. Thank heaven. I shouldn't cry. I know it. He wouldn't like it. You couldn't do nothing he wouldn't like. You're very fond of Jesse, aren't you? After my pa... There wasn't never nobody good to me like my pa... Except Mrs. McCanles... and Jesse. My dear. You will come and live with us, won't you? I want you to. Yes? I'm glad you and Jesse are... bespoken. Thank you. Hi, Pearl. How's the hero? I just heard he was gonna pull through. Tough luck, ain't it? But Lewt will get him next time. You can bank on that. - Next time? - Yeah. Next time. I got good news for you. Yeah? What is it? It's from Lewt. He says you got to hightail it out of here... if you want to kiss him good-bye... before he beats it across the border. You mean it? Where is he? I kind of figured you'd like that. He's hiding out at Squaw's Head Rock. You got that? Squaw's Head Rock. Just fire two shots when you get there. I got it. Squaw's Head Rock. Take the Apache trail to the mission. Any Indian there can tell you how to get to Buffalo Ridge. And then you... You got a good horse? It's a couple of days' ride. Sure. I got my pinto. You know, the one Lewt gave me before I was his girl. Hiya, Pearl! Here I am! I've been waiting for you! Hello, honey! I'll be right down! Stay there! I can't see you! Can you see me? You... double-crossing... bobcat! I guess that does it. You got me that time. I'm done for. You're lying. You're lying, like you always do! I can't shoot no more, honey. Honest. I'm not scared of you. I'm coming up after you. All right, then. Come on up! No use in my... lying no more. I'm through. You hear me? Yeah. I'm dying. I... I'm going... fast. Are you... Ain't you coming up? I want to see you. I got to see you. Where are you? Where are you? Hurry! Please! I... I got to... hold you... just once more. I love you. I love you! Hurry. Hurry! Hurry, honey. Hold on! Hold on! Hurry! Wait for me! Wait for me. Where are you? You always said you could shoot. I never believed you. I love you. I love you. Don't cry, honey. Don't cry. I had to do it. Of course you did. Let me hold you. Let me... Just hold me. Hold me once more. Little... bobcat.
