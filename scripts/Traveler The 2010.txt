What is going on here? - This guy says he has slain man. Let's take it easy, Gulloy. Gulloy, put the gun away. You, hands on your head! Who are you? Hands on your head. I said, throw your gun down! - He has his hands on his head! Gulloy, put your gun away. Hey, hey, hey. What is this? Gulloy said that this guy walked in and said that someone he had slain. Gulloy, put your weapon away before I push it down your throat. You. Put your hands above your head. I said put your hands above your head. Okay. Tough guy. Take him to the interrogation room. Keep an eye on him. What would you like to do? Shoot him? No, just ... You go sharpen your pencils and let the real work of adults. What are the state police here tonight? What's up, guys? Fratelli, say it again. - There was a serious accident on the highway. It takes all night to the messes. We train traffic to and have the exit ramp closed. So you are a quiet night. - It's quiet during the holidays anyway. I thought you all would be home working with presents from the suits. Yes. Well, you married men, wanted a good night. Dress your well. Well, who do you slain? What This guy is crazy, let him. It is for me not how I gaped. Come on, Jack. Everything's all in the eyes. And your eyes are full of fear.

Noboby'''' That really helps me. Okay. Then is it, Nobody. Okay, let's do it your way. Mr Nobody. Who exactly did you kill? Or am I missing something? Yes, you did. Are you going to confess something, or is this a stunt? I'd keep you here because you are a false confession, if you prefer. Detective ... ... be careful what you wish for. It could be coming from. What I can assure you that the evening is over I know you'll tell the truth, I really have committed a murder. Let the basic rules, take his fingerprints. Let's see what comes out. Mr Nobody has an accomplice. - My pleasure. Detective, which is a beautiful pen is the inscription:''for the best daddy in the world.'' way ... I've killed six people. ''To the best daddy in the world.'' Come on, Jeannie. Why are men such bad coffee? - Because they have no wife, who teaches them. You can handle women, which is really an insult. You know what they say about mistletoe? Yes, in some cultures get a kiss under the mistletoe considered a''kiss of death.'' Yes, that's just superstition. In some cultures, a kiss under the mistletoe considered a''kiss of love.'' Well, there are still no mistletoe. Voil! What if someone sees us so? - It's a mistletoe. It's the law. what's up I thought I saw that guy. I thought I saw him there. Hawkins and Pine have taken him for questioning. Hey, there's nobody here. You okay? - Yes, too much caffeine. I'll check anything. Okay. Face forward. Is something wrong, deputy? Are you ready? Jack are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. - Okay, next finger. Links Give me your other hand. What This guy has no fingerprints. Keep the hell can that happen? I do not know. I'm going to tell against Blackburn. Lock him up. Gulloy, come hither! Do me a favor and put him under lock and key, right? I need some lights out they are all blown. Just do it, okay? Here it began. All the lights went out at once, against all odds. Yes. - What do you think? I do not know. Maybe it's a warning. - A warning? For which purpose? Were you forgotten something? No printing. - Yes, I said no fingerprints. You can print with acid burn. - Yes, but that is not permanent. The pattern runs through many layers, but the skin is growing again. That would have left traces. - Maybe he cut them. The skin grows on along with the fingerprints. Skin has a birth memory. Really. Yes? Someone's good for the police, and ensures that we always find the bad. Okay, we're going we do with that guy? I walk him sometimes after. I have to call first. Jack, okay? Do you feel what I feel? What That stranger, Mr Nobody gives me the creeps. Black I am also nervous, as I understand? - Yes, indeed. There is something about that prisoner, I do not know what, but ... I can not work like hell. The lights are already here, Gulloy. You'll have to do it, we have no longer a lamp. And the pantry downstairs? These are all part beaten. What How did that happen? - I ... I do not know ... I'm going on with Mr. Nobody. - Mr Nobody? Yes, he did not mention his name. So he's real? - I do not know. Black has cracked it yet''.'' We would not go through that again with Black. - No, definitely not. This time of year there are lots of lonely people that false positives do so they have contact with someone at Christmas. So sad. Yes? I have this strange feeling that this is not a holidaymaker. Who are you? Nobody. Everything okay, deputy? It looks like you've seen a ghost. What is that? What is that? That tune. The Lacrimosa. Mozart's Requiem, the death march. It is said that he had been appointed by a messenger from the afterlife for his funeral. What do you think there would be some truth in it? Yes. Yes, I know. Can you please ...

I'll help you. Has anyone seen my scissors? Gulloy in which cell the prisoner's cell? - In cell four. Woe let go. Oh, damn. A must in a fuse box ended. Jesus Christ told Gulloy four cell? Were you looking at me? Gulloy can at least still count. Hey, were you cards? How did you get that? I said how did you get that? Walk, asshole. Tell me okay? This is your last chance. Is she alive? Where is my little girl? You'll say. - No, I do not know any little girl. You can not do. - Scourge him, whipping him. Hit him, one more time again. - Where is his daughter? Tell me where his daughter, or else I cut your tongue off. I am innocent, I am innocent. I am innocent. Hawkins is back already? - No, I have not seen him. Okay, Jeannie, do me a favor and help with Mr. Sherwood Houdini. Sure .. Thank you! Hey, where were you so afraid of? - Did he look familiar? Who? Our Mr. nodbody? He looks like that tramp. - What bum? That hitchhiker who has molested Black. - Jack, that's impossible. Let Black but not hearing that. Jerry, I fucking looked into his eyes, he is. Listen to me. It was a shitty situation we were all stressed out, let it go. You know what's weird? What We all were present during that night ... We are all there tonight. You, Sherwood, Jeannie and Gulloy and that damn Black. What a coincidence, huh? Come to size, we go inside, it is pouring down. Come on. I'll give you a few Christmas drinks after work, okay? It's about time. - Get to Fuck. Would you say anything? Red dress, blue hair, long legs. Winked at me. Anybody. The victim? You talk too much. What was the last time you've paid for something? What are you doing? Check something. - I see you so well. I stalked the victim. I waited ... Gulloy! This can be better but no fun, Gulloy! I waited until the anxiety would get him in its grip. Gulloy! I'm not in the mood for this. What's with the lights on? It was dark. And then I fell. I am innocent. Gulloy! - I am innocent. Let me out, damn, let me out. Gulloy! - I am innocent. Help You can not do. I'm innocent. - Hit him! Do it, save it! Save him! Save him! Help me! Listen. What the hell? Dreams. Keep an eye on him. Make him talk! Tell me where his daughter, otherwise I cut your tongue off. I am innocent. Jesus! Talking, otherwise I cut your tongue out! He does not scream anymore. Pine, did you hear that? - Yes, I do. It was absolutely down. oh my God Jesus Red dress, blue hair, long legs winking at me. Come on, we're here. Come on, Gulloy! Come on, Pine, come on. - What ...? Jesus, Black. Black What's going on? Black How did you do that done it? Put your hands flat on the table. Do it! What the hell is going on, Black? Buoy him, buoy him. Do it! Both hands. Just do it! So quickly to violence. Okay. We. What about him? Humor him. We go. Exit - Why, his hands were cuffed. No comment, just close. Are you going to tell us what is going on here, Black? Hawkins is dead. What oh my God I have the ground and the entire first floor investigated, nothing! Okay, what about outside? - We will be watching. Listen, miss ... Maybe we should help inroeppen. Help? We fuck the police Gulloy. Go! You give backing Pine, now get out! You control that side. I look at the front. Listen, Miss ... miss maybe it is better that we do not split. Come on. Damn it. Get it off me. Get it off me! What is that? - Where did that come from? It came from there. From the roof. Damn, what's that? Shining on the tape. That was the cat of Mary Black. We need the roof. - No, man, no, I'm not on the roof. Arise, and go fuck on the roof. Did you find anything? - We will look at the roof. Jesus, Gulloy, what happened? - You tell it. We found a cat. - A cat? A dead cat. - The collar was that of Mary. It is impossible. Can anyone tell me what is going on here? There's something I have to tell you. What Hawkins was previously so strange, he ... What, Pine? - He thought ... He thought that ... Mr Nobody reminded him ... ... the bum. Damn. Throw him in! Keep an eye on the door, Gulloy. Throw him in! Hit him! Turn him over, turn it around. Where is she? Hit him again. Turn it up, turn it up. - Where is she? - Innocent! He's my little girl. - You sure? - Yes! Come on, talk! - I am innocent. Come on. Black, Maybe she ran away. If she was alive, we have found her. This is the man, I swear, this is the man. You can not do. You, want you up? - No, everything is okay. I'm innocent, innocent. - Where is she? I swear, you'll say where she is. You heard him! Where is she? I know you seen the same spot as where she was last seen. Where is she? - I am innocent. Tell me if it's alive, please tell me whether she's alive. This is your last chance, tell me she is still alive? Look up, friend, look up. Hang him! - Come on, Black. Hang him! Come on, do it. Do it! - Put it on, Gulloy. Good. I am innocent. - Pull it up. Where is she? Where is she? Hit him. Again, again. I get him to talk. - Where is she? Look at me. - Hawkins, come on. Tell me where his daughter is because otherwise I cut your tongue off. Talk, because I cut your tongue off! Where is his daughter? Where the hell is his daughter? - Scourge him forward, whipping him. Save him! Save him! - Where is his daughter? Where is she? Jeannie, do it on his head. Do this over his head. I am innocent. - Put him through it, tight. eye for an eye More. Again. Where is she? You know stranger, I can get anywhere you have what I want. Do you know why? Because're a nobody. And that little girl is my flesh and blood. Do you understand? I am innocent. - Everyone get out now! Please. You can not make. I am innocent. - See this? My little girl has given to me this pen. Gulloy, it was never intended to go so far. I just wanted to save my daughter. Shut up, Gulloy, there was a good chance that they would be alive. Yes, but she was not! Having been awfully dead. State Police shot the bastard who did it, dead. She even found the medallion of little Mary on him. We know what happened, Gulloy, a lesson in history is unnecessary. Wanderer who was innocent, stupid bastard! Gulloy. Let the bags, please. Disgusting fat pig. I can not imagine much ... but all I have to do is pull the trigger. That's enough! We all knew what was at stake that night, right? We are accomplices. All of us. We are all guilty of what happened that night. If you did not like it you had to be stopped, but you did not. Do you? He ... he is still in a coma, you know. - How do you know? I got it checked. He's in Dale Crest. What have you done? Maybe you can live with, but I ... ... I can not live with the lies. It was he, Black. It was you who let us believe that story. You made us swear that he attacked us and we were forced to defend us. Jesus, what have we locked up? Pine and Gulloy, you will examine the roof. You two come with me. We go our Mr. Nobody, for questioning. [ ] Good Let's go. Black - Is he there? Open it. What was that? What Stay here! Pine! It's time to start talking, pal. My second victim was ... - Need. He was the coward. I approached him from behind. Why are you doing this? He does not care about its consequences to face. Watch the door! - What's going on? You can not do. - Hey, Gulloy, I want you you grab it! I am innocent. Who are you? Gulloy! Gulloy, where are you? Tie him up! Tie him up, come on, Black! Tie him up. Do it! Do it! I can also wire. Come on, I am innocent! You can not do. Please. With a piece of rope ... I strangled him. And I left him hung out to dry. Fuck! Jesus Pine! What happened? I do not know. But here we were apart. Someone has been up there. - I said no one was upstairs. Nobody! Nobody. Fuck. - Come on. Through all this I wonder if God exists. Honey, do not worry about all that shit. Hey, I want the bastard locked up. Now I mean it! Hurry! Goddamn. Jesus Christ Let him who is without sin cast the first stone. - You better shut your klotebek. It's ironic, right? The Old Testament God had placed high, but ... ... people felt uncomfortable with the concept, had needed a bestseller. So they came to the New Testament. Suddenly God was loving and forgiving. I am from the old school. I prefer the Old Testament. - You have to love a God who is not even afraid of a little revenge ... if they need a resurrection. Get it here. Does the name Mary Black, anything? A little girl who was murdered last year. She was my daughter. We had a bum arrested. - We have checked his fingerprints, but that did not occur. So he was a Nobody. Yes. Lock him up. Put him into it. The wanderer is in a coma, right? If he is locked up all day, how can he kill Hawkins and Gulloy? And then this guy walks in here with his Prince of Darkness stature, and an accomplice to us for a finish ... I do not think the one with the other faces. What do you say, Black? I don't know That's it! What Pine, what is it? Gulloy the bum said he had checked in the normal way. He said he .... - Crestel? - Yes. Crestel. Let's see if he has recently been awakened from his coma. Yeah, maybe he escaped. - That would be nice. Dale Crest Care Centre 409 Beatty Street New York Hi, here's deputy Pine. I want information about one of your patients. One of our deputies on a regular basis inquired. Yes, he was deputy Gulloy. That's right, the''John Doe.'' He died earlier this evening? You happen to know the exact time of death? Thank you though. The tramp is dead at 8:14 PM. Gulloy has included in its report ... ... that Mr. Nobody at 8:14 PM, by that door is coming. We must call for help. Call Douglas. Sheriff Mc Call. Arthur. - It's Christmas Eve. That I do not care! We have two deputies dead! The line is dead. - What? - We use it! He's dead! - Maybe it's the rain. Keep trying. He's dead. - They're all dead. I saw from the roof light. Maybe it was the state police previously. They cut the driveway because of the accident on the highway. - Pine and I can go to radio or gain to call? That's a good idea. Do it. - I'm with you. You do not have to do. - I want that. I guess we just wait, huh? Pine ... Yes? ... between you and me ... What do you think we have locked down there? I have no idea. Part of me wants to know. Where's that bastard? Black, where are you going? - I want to know who the stranger. Why? - You know why. There they are. I see none. - Turn around and step on the brakes once. Where are they? - Here. I'm waiting for you. What is this guy, ventriloquist? - I am here. Help me. And we are the idiots. Yes? [ ] Good Slowly -I wait for you. It was this. Look! - I am here. Shit. Which you had that bum. Did he have a name? No. Why? He did not give us that. - He did not give it to you ... What happened to him? There was an accident. - There was an accident ... I'm ready to continue with my confession. My next victim was a married man ... Jeannie to make sure you get the radio and make sure they come here asap. Where are you, guys! Jeannie, Sherwood, contact your Jeannie, Sherwood, contact you on! Did you hear that? I'll go listen. Jeannie, Sherwood, contact you on! - Mary is found, you receive me? Pine? This is Pine, report you. about! - Pine, is that you? Stop it. I was blocked ... ... in the shadows. I found Mary's black body. She is in pieces. It's horrible. My God, who is going to tell against Blackburn? Who is this? - It's horrible. - Make yourself known. She is in pieces. - Who is this! Pine, Sherwood, contact you on! - Mary is found, you receive me? Sherwood, can you hear me? Sherwood! Goddamn. You complain to the poor and protect the rich. - Shut up! Damn. Guys? Guys?! This is your last chance. - I stood behind him. He had seen me. Black! Black, what are you doing? No! Pine, you do not understand! - What are you doing? You do not understand. Come play with me, asshole! Want to play. come on! Express yourself! Express yourself. Wait, where is he? Relax, nothing. Look, there's nothing. There is nothing there. Nothing. ... and then I attack! Sherwood? Sherwood! Come on. Jesus Christ. Wait, Sherwood. Save him! I said, beat him! Jesus No? No! No! Sherwood! Sherwood! Sherwood, where are you? With all my husbands, what I am together gweest and run around freely in Sherwood Forest Struggle was waiting for them, leaving them dead and unmarried. once more once more Sherwood! Please, answer! Sherwood! Sherwood! Sherwood! Sherwood. Goddamn, Black, would you tell me where you're looking for? Black, what are you doing? Jesus Christ Jeannie! He's dead. He's dead. - Who? Sherwood? Jeannie, look at me! Tell what happened. We had the State Police patrol car found. It was empty. There was nobody. I heard on the radio and let him alone. I'm sorry, honey. - What happens? I don't know Mr. Nobody. His confessions. Every time he confesses it comes out. What are you talking about? - He kills us with his confessions. Jesus Christ Why do torturers, caps? Why fire load execution squads, but a gun with blanks and the rest? Why turn the knob to three people, and has only one power? So no need to live with the guilt? No, because of superstition. In England ... where the executioners to the guillotine work even though their faces hidden behind a black hood. Once they go home, barricading themselves behind the door, and hide. They hide their victims. Why? Because they believe that their victims condemn and come back as invisible spirits in the middle of the night. Even now they cover their faces. Their identity. Why they felt so strongly. Because nobody to be. It gave them freedom of ontastbaren. - And the lifter was one of them? Yes. He uses his cap of invisibility. The hunters of the shadow. And he's come back to pay us to work for what he had done. And we let him go through that door. - But we have him executed. And if we did. Deny it. You got us involved. You make sure we come out. That's enough. Enough! What do we do? What do we do? When I was in Desert Storm Sat ... we were attacked. And hard. Believe none of those stories that Sadam guys gave up. We were almost overrun ... But our commander told us ... that it no shame to retreat, if you were strongly opposed to Dex. I saw what you say. We're going to fight back tomorrow, right? We're pushing the patrol car back, well, come on. Come on! We push him back. Reverse, Jeannie. What am I doing wrong? - Put the hood. Try again, Run it again, Jeannie. - Come on! He does not. - Damn! Ready to hear my confession? That is horrible. Coming. Jeannie, persist! The door locks. Open the door, Jeannie. She had long blonde hair, blue eyes. I could not wait for her to suffocate. Jeannie, tame the door. I don't know - This is your last chance. Danny, she is still alive? Listen, I'm guilty. - No, I can do it! Jeannie, pull it over his head! Pull it over his head. Tell me where she is. I don't know I know you have seen in the same spot where she had last been seen. Go back lie, Jeannie. You are about to take a nice tour of the Devil of darkness to get. Poor girl, the forces of darkness you have claimed for themselves. Come on, motherfucker. Christ. " You know what, stranger. I can do what I want and you know why? Because you're a nobody! No solid surface under your feet. No friendly neighbors to cheer you. Jeannie, go down! Jeannie! Now you are between the gallows and the insane silence. On the way to the silence. Other silence. Jeannie! No warning voice .. ... You hope nobody whispers. You are by the forces of darkness attacked. The lightning attack from the rear of the nothing has come to bury and kill you. Poor girl. She lost her head. Pine ... Pine! Pine, what do you think you do? - Shut up! They're all dead. I will be ass bastard! - Pine! Were you me? Time for the next confession. You can not hide in the dark. The shadows. Beware the shadows. The next victim never saw it coming. Who did this? What's going on? Pine! What the fuck, man? Save him! Turn around! Where is she? Again. Help him up! - Where is she? Look up my friend. Look up. Do not do this. - Tie him up! Do it around. An eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Another one. I can not save. I can not see anything. - I've got my eye. eye for an eye Are you ready to hear my last confession, Detective? Let him who is without, cast the first stone. Stay away from me: Stay away! You can not escape. All roads lead to me. Leave me alone! You can not hide in the darkness. I told you so. All roads lead to me tonight. Where it all began and where it all ends are. Confession time. I confess! I confess that I wanted, I confess, right? I confess I'm an innocent man was assaulted, okay? I still have a confession. I was not innocent. Have you done it? Yes. Hey, little girl. No? Did you do it? -I heard that she was jumping rope. Hi. - Hi. What do you have a beautiful cat. No? Her name is Shining. - Shining, that's a pretty name. I also have a cat, would you see? - I have to go home. Daddy! Daddy! That state police ... who did not have to kill you. Have you found her locket? - I've thrown away the medallion. Some idiot has picked him. A bum ... a stranger ... So you're guilty. - I'm afraid so. You have sworn his innocence. - What did you expect? Why? Why kill us? - Revenge. I waited until I was released and the only thing I had dreamed of revenge. Do you have any idea how powerful a dream can be, if you can not escape from? Takes a life of itself. Dirty bastard. My last victim was Detective Alexander Black. He was a righteous man. He loved his children. We will miss him. See this? My little girl gave me a pin. excuse me I am no longer able to hear your confessions. Detective Black, you're dead. - Yours is an impenetrable darkness. I see you as a man at the bottom of a pit is where the sun never shines. There are not many tears for all the misery that have worried. You are surrounded by death. Strange that I should accept this unforeseen partnership, this ..... choice of nightmares that have forced me here. Because these men invited. That evil and greedy phantoms, filled with hatred. What ... Who ... Why? I wanted to come earlier but I was scared. I love you - I have come to help you, Daddy. I can hear you. That's a bad man. - Yes, that's it, honey. He makes me afraid. No? He can not hurt. Are you going to stop him, Dad? I wish I could do that. - You can. Like so many others. I walked through the valley of the dead and became the Shadow of evil. How? How can I stop him? Please, dear. Please tell me how I can stop it. He does not like his name. He does not want people to know it. He hides. He hides in the shadows. There he is strong. no one makes him strong. - I know his name. Lay that eddy Well, look who decided to come play. Stanley Harperton. That's your name anyway, is not it? How? Stanley Harperton, child killer. - Stop. Killer. - I can not. Coward. - Wait ... Sorry, I can not hear you. Thank you, Daddy. I love you. I gotta go now. Mary ... I love you, baby. Very much.
