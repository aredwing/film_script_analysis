GROANING Whoa! Aaaargh! CAT MIAOWS Oof! (ABOVE) Gran? Oh, no! I take it Dad's not home. CAT GROWLS What's up with Henry? Shut the door, quick. We can't let it escape. - Let what escape? One of them. The little people! The little people? Aaargh! There we go! Get it, Henry! It's under the sofa. Quick, hold this. Me and Henry will herd them towards you. You're our net man. Don't just stand there! - Your net man? That's it, Henry, don't let him escape. Tuck your shirt in, James. RUMBLING ABOVE Mum! Did you hear that? - Hear what, Etty? There were beans, and a cat, and then I heard a loud thump. Nonsense, you're letting your imagination run away with you. Phe-ew! MIAOWS Dad's in trouble! - He'll be fine. VACUUMING ABOVE Aaargh! Aaaargh! Aaargh! VACUUM CLEANER SWITCHES OFF What are you doing? - I was going to ask you the same thing. Switch it back on, it'll escape! What will? - There it is! What? - It was one of them. It was right there. I'm sure of it. Yeah. All right, Gran. You really expect me to believe nothing happened? Yeah. Well, what about the banging? The cat? The hoover? Hoover? What hoover? - I could hear through the floorboards. Don't be silly, Etty, your dad's far too clever to get mixed up with those creatures. You'd have to be an idiot to go upstairs when there's beans about. That's right. You've got to realise that borrowing is boring. Well, let me come with you next time, so I can see for myself. Why? Everything you need, I provide. - Not everything. there aren't other Borrowers round here. You'd have to walk for miles. It'd take weeks, months even. What about my aunt and uncle? My cousin Eggletina? We can't. We could go visit them. You must know where they are. We are not visiting anyone. Why not? - Because I said so. It's so unfair! I hate you! 'Thank you, Dad, for the beautiful strawberry cream...' What's that for? I was worried sick. I had it under control. Yeah. Sounded like it, too. You know, you weren't much older than her when you got your first pickings. Down here, she's safe. Down here, we can take care of her. Yeah, and having the time of her life! Well, she has it better than most. - It's not enough for her! She's like you. Borrowing's in her blood.

Aaarghh! - Aaargh! Get away from me! Ow! If that's someone breaking in, I suggest you break back out again. Gran, you won't believe this. You can't let her see me. - But... What is it? What are you hiding in there? Nothing. My paint pots. Well, which is it? Both. It's nothing. Well, no, it's not nothing, it's my paint pots, which is nothing. I'm not hiding anything. Have a look if you like. Well, keep it down. You might not need your beauty sleep, but I do. You're telling me. I can't believe she was right. My own little person! Who are you calling little? Well, you are quite small. No, I'm not. It's you who's...too big, a great big overgrown giant. We're just the right size. We? There's more of you? I didn't say that. Get back! - Ow! I was only going to help you out. You aren't going to eat me? Eat you? What would be the point? My name's James. Arrietty. You want a hand? Yes, please. Oh...! If that was supposed to be funny...! Well, it serves you right for stealing my gun. We don't steal, we borrow. So there ARE more of you? What's that? How about I show you? So what exactly does this thing do...aaargh! Arrietty, are you all right? Look, I'm so sorry. I had no idea you'd fly so...well. Can we do it again? ARRIETTY LAUGHS That was the furthest yet! What shall we do now? What's out there? How about I show you? I've tried to imagine what it looked like, the sky, the houses. It's amazing. We call it Hackney. Right, you must promise not to tell anyone. I promise. Who's that? My mum. She died last year. Sorry. We don't talk about her in case it upsets me. I'll see you soon. Well, go on. Don't just sit there gawping. Go. See ya. Cebuella pygmaea, the pygmy marmoset. The pygmy hippo, Choeropsis liberiensis. Microcebus myoxinus, the pygmy mouse lemur, which let us not forget, is, like you and me, a primate. And, er, Atelerix albiventris, the African dwarf hedgehog, so called because of its white stomach. Countless times, we come across these examples of, of life in miniature...and yet, and yet, the very notion of miniaturisation in the Homo genus is dismissed... .. as absurd. Despite clear photographic evidence. Hmm? Yes? Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Homo sapiens redactus, wise man reduced. BELL RINGS Well, thank you all for your attention. Evidence, Jonathan, you need evidence. There are photos. - As there are of the Loch Ness monster. Fairies, pixies, leprechauns, the Hawaiian Menehune, the Yunwi Tsunsdi of Cherokee legend, the Scandinavian Smallfolk. The South African tokoloshe. - Let's not forget the tokoloshe. Myths. Legends. Yes. In almost every culture around the globe, there are references to 'little people'. Now, are we to dismiss it as mere coincidence that separate cultures individually dreamt up the same myth, or is it not more likely that there is in fact truth behind that myth? Look, I've had complaints. Drop it from the course. I'm no longer asking. What a total chomp. Worry not, Jennifer, the inquisition may have forced Galileo to recant his notion that the Earth revolves around the sun, but I am not so easily turned. For breakfast? CLEARS HER THROA I had a word with your dad about taking you upstairs. Really? Yeah. Don't get ahead of yourself, though, you've got a lot to learn. I'll be able to do it. You're just as cocky as your dad was. I'm nothing like him. You'd better hope that's not true. Why? - Because great Borrowers have an instinct. They know what's going to happen before it... actually does, sense a bean before they're seen. Do you have it? Yeah. I just like to let your dad take most of the glory. You don't, do you? No, I don't have it. But your dad does. As did his father and his father before him. So I might have it? I thought you didn't want to be like him. I don't. CLOCK TICKS Hello. We haven't got much time. Why, what's happening? I've been seen. Get your things. Come on, come on! Can you give me a hand? James? What are you doing with those? You're not to touch your mum's dolls' house! Ever! Sorry, I wasn't... What's the clock doing like that? Who did this? - Look, leave it, Gran, I'll get it out. What are you...? No, Gran, don't! Don't! Gran! Gran, would you please stop? - Not until I see what's down there. There isn't anything. Gran, please! You're tearing the house to pieces! Dad...? The table, now! - Gran! No! Please! Gran! Stop! Gran! My things. My compact, my old wristwatch. I was just playing. That looks like your grandfather's gold sovereign. Aaargh! Something just moved down there. I didn't see anything. BORROWERS SCREAM Ugh! They're everywhere! They've got your grandfather's gold coin. Thieving little pickpockets! Run, Arrietty! Run! Don't hurt them! - Vermin! Gran, stop, please! - Arrietty! Arrietty! - Come on! Go, go, go, go, go! Gran, stop! - Vermin! Through there. Please! - Ow, get off! What's going on? - It was them! Little thieves, with their little hands, little faces. He saw them, too. Tell him! I didn't see anything. Liar! - Carol. I'm not crazy, Robert. I know what I saw, and so does he. Go, go, go! Come on! Go! Jump! Go! What was all that about? I built a den under there for my toys. You OK? I'm used to it by now. Come here. Try not to let it upset you, OK? Your gran's still getting used to having us here. Leave this lot. I'll sort it out when I get back. Where are you going? I've taken a night job, just to tide us over. You look after your gran for me. Want a house left to come home to. ARRIETTY SCREAMS Aaaargh! Aaargh! Help! Help! Help! OK? He called you Arrietty. What? - The boy, he knew your name! Look, if you'd have let me go up with you... How could you be so stupid? - I'm sorry! I made sure he didn't see... see where we lived. You should never have spoken to him in the first place. You should never have been upstairs. He could've killed you. - Pod, breathe! This isn't funny! I know it's not, but you're turning purple and you're scaring her. Maybe if we wait a while, they'll, they'll forget. We could go back. No. Now that we've been seen, it's over. All that work and what I did on the house - gone! Yeah, but shouting at her isn't going to bring it back. We're alive, that's all that matters. Where will we live? Somewhere new. I've looked outside. There's hundreds of houses, thousands. You know, we might even find some other Borrowers. Too many beans. We'll emigrate. We'll move somewhere far from here. Somewhere safe. Come on. OK. Let's go. Move, move, move! So, um, if I can ask, how exactly did you find out about my particular area of expertise? On the internet. - Ah, a silver surfer, eh? Well, platinum blonde, if you will. Naturally. Ahem. Oh, I'm sorry, this is Jennifer, my international research student. She has a rare and inquisitive mind. Rest assured, Carol, anything you wish to say to me, you can say in front of her. So, how can I help you? I've seen one of them. One of what, exactly? One of the little people. We should have been honest with her. You said that there weren't any others! You said we'd have to travel for months. You lied to me! Your dad had his reasons. - Homily. Stay with your mother. Oh, where are you going? To find someone to get us out of here. Pod? It's been a while. It certainly has. How do people know Dad? There's a nest of them under the floor. It makes my skin crawl thinking about it. You are certain it was here? Where's it gone? It was there. My wristwatch was on the wall. They took my husband's half sovereign, the thieves. No-one stole anything. I was only borrowing it. This watch went missing long before you and your father moved here. Tell me the truth now, and I won't be cross. Well, that's not true. I will be cross, but not as much as if you lie. I took it. Young man, have you any idea of the scientific value of these creatures? A species so similar to our own, we could learn so much from Homo sapiens redactus! Huh? From the little people. What little people? Are you for real? Oh, yes, I most assuredly am for real. Professor? Check this. Tweezers. Well, now, if you were planning to set a trap for Homo sapiens redactus, what would be the most irresistible bait, do you think? Liquorice shoelaces! Liquorice shoelaces! Mum, please don't embarrass me! What do you mean? What can be embarrassing about this? It's... No, Arrietty, you...no. Watch out! Are you OK? - Yeah. All right, boys, I still got the top score, yeah? Mum, where are you going? You with the hair! I'm talking to you! Hi. Hi? Don't 'hi' me. Didn't you see my daughter there? Mum, it's OK. I'm fine. - Hi. Hi. - My name's Spiller. She doesn't care what your name is! Have you ever been on the back of a motorbike? No. No, and you won't either. Take it from me, they're not worth the risk. You've been on a motorbike? We're not talking about me! - Well, maybe we should be. Oh, you keep rubbing me up the wrong way, see what happens. I won't rub you up any way. Apologise! - For what? For running her over. OK, OK! I'm sorry. Were you hurt? No, no... I just grazed my hand. - Oh, well, let me kiss it better. I don't think so. Where else are you hurt? I've got plenty more kisses. Right, right, let's just get out of here. You never told me your name. So close, so close. And you wonder why your father kept you under the floorboards. BEEPING It's really changed here. It's bigger. Blimey, Pod, that's insightful. Well, it is. You've got a fight on your hands just walking down the street. Yeah, but it's...it's fun to be at the heart of it all again. I found a guide. He's going to take us to a house far away from here. Outside the city. Only one bean. Plenty of borrowings. I was thinking maybe we could stay here? We leave tomorrow. Yeah, but I think it might be better for Arrietty. I mean, down here, we are far from any beans. I wouldn't be able to keep me eye on her. Maybe that's a good thing. We leave tomorrow. # We are all made of air # There's stars in my eyes and there's sun in my hair # And I'm running away It makes me feel better # It's just like you told me it'd be # It's nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' at all # When it comes down to this # I'm neither sorry nor coarse nor unfit # And I'm running away There's smoke on my sweater # It's just like you told me it'd be # It's nothin', nothin', nothin' Nothin' at all... # 'I'm sorry! I had no idea you'd fly so well.' 'Can we try it again?' # I had some brand new shoes # They were all red, but they gave me the blues # And they're runnin' away They left me a letter # It's just like you told me it'd be # It's nothin', nothin', nothin' Nothin' at all. # Throw a handful. You might stand a chance of hitting something. Let's see. No, wait, don't! You nearly had my eye out! It serves you right for nearly running me over. Why are you staring at me like that? Cos you never told me your name. Arrietty. Hey, I didn't know she was your daughter. Not that I'd dream of doing anything. I see you've met our guide. We were only getting to know one another. Not too well, I hope. I know your reputation, but I have to ask. Payment on arrival, as agreed. - Can I at least see it? How do you know my dad? He doesn't. Do you want some rat? It's good. I hope you've got something else for us to eat. Got some hedgehog. - You're really quite grubby, aren't you? Don't know how you mean. Everything all right, Jennifer? Yes, Prof. Just, there's quite a funk down here. Is there any sign of our quarry? I can't see any... Wait... I can see some footprints. Looks like two. Three, maybe. Set the trap. And make sure that the mechanism is well camouflaged. What are you doing with those? Oh, hello, um... .. boy. Er, well, we're trying to ensnare your unwanted guests. Er, alive preferably, but if not, well, a dead specimen is as much a proof of the existence of the species as a live one, isn't it? I'm going to lower down another trap now. You're wasting your time. Oh, really? They don't exist. I think I'd rather believe your grandmother on that score, thank you. By the way, I was wondering, is there a Mr Driver? No, Grandad died years ago. Excellent. I mean, isn't it...isn't it excellent how your grandmother copes? She's so alive, she's so, so vital. You won't find anything down there. - Ah, that's what you think. Give my warmest regards to your grandmother. Tell her we won't rest till we've captured all of these creatures. Rob, it's really dark down here. Oh, don't be such a cry-baby. Arrietty! It runs all the way out of the city. Beans never come down here, so it's safe to travel, night and day. Well, how do we get down? I'll show you. Argh! Oh! You are such a pig! Now who's grubby, huh? Whoa! Come on, these are the only clothes I've got. I'm not doing anything. You've got that look. - What look? What? - Oh, Homily... Aaargh! You are such an idiot! You're the one who can't stand up straight. I really don't like you. That's because you haven't got to know me. Right. You're dead! Hey, hey! Not the face! Come on, you know you love it, Dad! What's all this? Nothing, really. Clearing out some old junk. But this is your favourite game. No, it's Daniel Wickes' favourite game, only bid, 3.50. These are your toys, you can't! Well, I hardly play with them any more. James, you don't have to do this. Garth Woods, 2.50. Didn't your mum get you this? She'd understand. Right, better get going. No, wait, Dad. Your tie's wonky. So what does 'shortlist' actually mean? Two, maybe three other candidates. - So you've got a good chance, then? Oh, yeah. Don't suppose you've seen my keys anywhere, have you? Where's my key-ring? Jeremy Harris, 70 pence. Just...don't sell Gran, OK? I'll be cleaning myself for a week. God, you're such a princess. She made a mistake. It's called snow. I know. You know, no matter how much you think you know about something, until you've actually experienced it, you've no idea. I was trying to do right by you. By keeping me under the floorboards? - You're still young. I'm 16! If you'd shown me how to borrow, I'd have... been more careful. I wouldn't have been seen. You went upstairs once, and look what happened. I didn't know what I was doing! If you'd've taught me...! It was too dangerous! - You're as bad as each other! No, Mum! I'm sorry, but no. Arrietty! What is it? Proper food. You be careful. You're never happier than when you're telling me what to do. Listen to him. Arrietty! Mum? Dad? HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS Yeah! I totally rock on! In your face, Axeman 95! APPLAUSE AND CHEERING FROM SCREEN Thank you, thank you, thank you. COMPUTER BEEPS Prof. Trap 501 has been deployed. It's no use. It's too heavy. The candle! Maybe we could melt the frame. It's worth a try. NOISES IN DISTANCE What is it? - Pod... Give them here. - I can do it! GROANING You've got to keep her safe. The coin's still in my pack. Dad? You promise me you'll keep her safe. - I promise. I don't understand. The matches will dry, we'll get you out. It's too late. - They're here. Beans. Go with Spiller. No, I'm not leaving you. You've got to. - I won't. Go with him to the Underground. No! I won't leave you here. - You've got to listen to your father. No! - Just listen to him. Don't be. Take her, Spiller. Come on. - No! Get off me! We've got to go. - I love you so much. Mum! Dad! We'll be fine. - Mum! Oh! Aren't you gorgeous? How did it go? Er, they said I had too much experience. Well, that's a good thing, isn't it? - It means he's too old. What're you doing with those? I thought we could put them up on the roof. Gran's got a ladder in the garden. I'm sorry. We'll do it another time, yeah? Come on. I made you a sandwich. I cut the crusts off so your hair won't go curly. Let me. You're making a right mess. Your dad doesn't want to be out all hours, you know. Feels like he does. He's got job interviews, and the only reason he's working every night humping meat around is so we can afford a nice Christmas. I don't care about Christmas. Thanks for giving back the watch and the mirror. I thought they'd gone for ever. There's just one thing still missing. Your grandfather's gold sovereign. Is it worth a lot of money? Your grandfather always said so. Still, it's gone... Isn't it? Why are you asking me? Because you took...sorry, 'borrowed', the other things. Come on, James, you can talk to me. I'm your grandmother. I haven't got your stupid coin! Hey! Where are you going? Huh? Look, there's nothing we could've done. - We could've tried! And we'd have been taken too! Come back. Get off of me! Get off! Look, you can't go after them. They're gone! Don't you say that! OK, OK, I'm sorry. Getting yourself killed isn't going to bring them back. Go back to the Underground, Spiller! There's no way out. What are they going to do to us? I dread to think. I'm just glad Etty's safe. For now. What do you mean? There's no way she's going to let Spiller take her to the Underground. She's far too stubborn for that. - Oh, she gets that from you. From me?! She doesn't just get the bad bits from you, she gets the good stuff too. Your cleverness, your courage, your warmth. Rugged good looks? I wouldn't go that far. But you should be proud, you should be pleased she wants to travel the world, that she's got the same sense of adventure as you. I am. I've been an idiot, haven't I? - Yes, you have. But you're my idiot, so you're forgiven. Hello? Spiller, is that you? 'Th... This is a message for Carol, my platinum blonde bombshell. 'Anyway, I wanted you to be the first to hear the good news. 'We have them - 'the little thieves that have been terrorising you for so long.' DOOR OPENS 'Message deleted.' COUGHS STRAINS Jump! Come on, I got you! Phew! A woman's heart is a curious thing. An enigma wrapped in a quandary - a cryptic conundrum secretly scrawled on a scroll of finest woven papyrus and locked in a cyrus cylinder of the utmost complexity - it's unfathomable. Utterly unfathomable. I suppose that's why we find it so alluring, isn't it, Clive? Oh, Clive. I understand the creatures of the world at a cellular level, molecular, even, yet the secrets of a woman's heart are a mystery that I've never been able to solve. Until now! Ha! Now, now, I can play the part of the conquering hero, the triumphant warrior returning, having slain the beast... .. and I can lay my heart open at the homestead of my love. Professor? How long have you been standing there listening to me? Not long... Seconds. Good. Very good. Excellent, so, how can I help you? There's a problem with the specimens. Sorry, I mean, 'the beasts'. Do we get to slay them now? Be quiet, Jennifer! We should be safe here. What is this place? Hey, you're shivering. We need to get you dry. How? Come on. Hmm, I think I'll use ultrasound... see if I can detect a heartbeat. What happened? Well, it could be any number of causes, really. Proximal factors, close human contact, airborne diseases, shock. Does this mean I get to dissect the little skebangas? I have to say, I find it a little disconcerting that you had that quite so readily to hand. Jenny? Yes, Prof? Where have they gone? Seriously, where are they? What? That's impossible. And do I get a thank you? What for? For saving your life! I'd have thought of something. I should've let you get sucked up by that machine. So why didn't you? Don't think it's because I like you. I don't. - So why did you come back, then? Because I want that coin. And I need to keep you safe to get it. So you're going to help me? Don't look at me like that. I meant what I said. I still don't like you. That's because you haven't got to know me yet. Is that an offer? Oh! You move fast! Not that I'm complaining. Beans are coming! - What? No, they're not. DOOR OPENS Beginner's luck. Which way? Pod? - I'm thinking. Ah, how wonderful! You can talk! Run! Got you! # With the angelic host proclaim # Christ is born in Bethlehem # Hark, the herald angels sing # Glory to the newborn king! # How do you know the words to this? I picked it up. They sing it every borrowing season. You know the beans don't call it that. They call it Christmas. Who cares? All I know is that for three weeks every year, the beans leave rich pickings for us Borrowers. Hmm. Strawberry cream for dessert every night. Nuts. Chocolate... I could tell you were spoilt. I lived in a hole. Yeah, your dad's a bit of a nutter, isn't he? Don't call him that. You've changed your tune. How do you know my dad? You may not think to look at him now, but your old man's a hero. What?! He stopped the beans from finding the Underground, and risked his life to do it too. I don't believe you. Fair enough. Spiller, what happened? Your dad wasn't able to save everyone. There was a girl - she didn't make it. Why? He had to make a choice. What was she called? Eggletina. My cousin! Yeah, well, after that he wasn't seen around the Underground again. Even though he saved the town, everyone blamed him for her death? No, no, but he did. That probably explains why you had it so good - if you didn't want for nothing, there'd be no reason for you to go getting into trouble, would there? Nuts, chocolate, strawberry cream! I haven't got close to strawberry cream in years, and you've been getting them every night! Do you really think we'll be able to find them? Yeah. Of course we will. No idea how yet, but... REVEREND:.. whom in the Lord Jesus... Can you get us back home - to my old home, I mean? There's someone there who I think can help. Who? No, you can't be serious. Not one of them. They can't be trusted! This one can be. Well, I'm very sorry to hear about your grandmother - I hope it's nothing too serious. No. Just a cold. Rhinitis acuta catarrhalis. Well, make sure you give her my very best wishes. Yeah. Now then, young man, do you remember telling me that this was from one of your dolls? I suppose I must've been wrong. Indeed. Behold. Can I have a closer look? Don't touch. They're wily little weasels. Who are you calling a weasel? I thought we agreed not to speak to them! I'm not putting up with her insults - calling us names like that! It's fascinating, isn't it? Their domestic constructs are not so different from our own. We demand food and water and to be released immediately! Sustenance will naturally be provided. We want you in the rudest possible health before you're presented to the world.

Only for a very short period before we get down to the serious business of... anatomical analysis - physical tests, blood work. Dissection. - Obviously dissection. You're going to cut them up?! - It's not as bad as it sounds. We'll gas them first. We're not monsters, you know. Were there any others? These were the only two we captured. Why? Have you see any more? No. I just saw those two. - Oh. Now, this exquisite grandmother of yours, do you think she's a bunch of flowers or a box of chocolates sort of person, hm? Is James in? Do you think he'll like it? I think he'd rather his dad was around than some swish toy. I wanted it to be special. Well, what a stupid waste of money! I thought I'd done something right for a change! That would've been a change! Yeah, I know, and how many more times are you going to let him down? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... It's all right. - It's not. You distract yourself with the little things, and you end up forgetting about what's really important. I'm sorry. What's this? We didn't have enough to get by. I thought you would get a job soon and I thought I could keep up the repayments. They're taking the house. Keep out of sight and let me do the talking. 'Thanks for getting me back, Spiller! 'Without you, I wouldn't have had a clue where I was going, Spiller'! The attention of the scientific community will tomorrow be focused on the zoological department of a London University. Professor Jonathan Mildeye... That's him! - You're alive! Argh! - Arrietty, run! Argh! You're pulling my face off! - Let him go! JAMES GROANS He was going to squash you. - No, he wasn't! Are you all right? This is Spiller. He's an idiot. Hey! - That... Who is he? His name's Professor Mildeye. He has them in his laboratory. So they're still alive, then? - For now. .. and if it's true, it will be one of if not THE greatest discovery in natural history we've ever known. Here, I got you this. It should be comfortable.

It's perfect, it's just that there's only one of it. What's the problem? There's plenty of room for both of us. Well, Gran's upstairs now and I can't risk taking another. Do you really think we're going to be able to pull it off? I guess we'll find out tomorrow. DOOR OPENS I'd better get to bed. Night, James. - Night. Hold on tight. Come on. Saved you a spot.

'We're hearing from a reliable source that Professor Mildeye has in fact 'managed to capture one of the creatures, and... there's speculation he'll reveal it to us. 'The interest is huge and scientists from all over the country 'have descended upon the university 'eagerly awaiting this morning's presentation.' LAUGHS AND HUMS TO HIMSELF Ah, are we primed? The camera's set up, ready to broadcast across the net. We've already had over a million hits on the site. I've been waiting for this moment all my life. Years of ridicule, ostracised for expounding a theory that has turned out to be correct. I've always been solid behind you. And soon they all will be. I shall join the pantheon of scientific greats - Darwin, Mendel. Crick, Watson. Mildeye. Are you OK? Hold on tight. If you want to get out, this is your last chance. Nah, you'd miss me too much. ENGINE STARTS Oh, no! This doesn't feel good! Come on, climb! We're not going to make it! Climb! SCREAM BREATHES A SIGH OF RELIEF You nervous? It's OK to admit it. Even I am a little bit. You can do this. You know, Spiller, you're a complete idiot! So you've said. And...and quite annoying. Actually, very. And arrogant! Completely and utterly. But I'm glad you're here. You know, despite, you being you. If I wasn't, you wouldn't like me. Probably not. So you DO like me? SCREAM Pull the cord! Pull it! There's the air vent. Wait! Arrietty! - What?! So? Do you? Do I what? You know. Spiller, we haven't got time for any of your stupid games! SCOFFS - Unbelievable! CHATTER LAUGHS - The penmanship and enthusiasm. They're almost childlike. Well, she's getting on now. Her hands are a bit shaky. So what would you suggest I give her next? Erm, silk stockings, perhaps? But there is something else you could do to get my gran's attention. Go on? - Those creatures of yours. Homo sapiens redactus? Yeah. She hates them, wants them all wiped out and I know where you can find a whole load more of them. Keep back! That's my husband you're molesting. Homily, don't start! The Professor wants them to get a good look at your anatomy. I don't care what you call it, you're not getting your hands on my husband's! Come here. Dad's in his underpants and Mum's shouting. So I guess they're OK. PHONE RINGS Prof... I'm on my way now. I want those clothes off by the time I get back. Oh, Pod, I don't know how much more I can take of this. It's going to be all right. How? How is it going to be all right?! How can you say that?! Because Arrietty's just about to save us. - What?! Arrietty. - Yes! Now grab the thread! We haven't much time! OK, grab it. - OK. You first. - But I... .. get inside and see whether the organs are... Pull! That's it, that's it! GASP AND GROAN The boy made the most extraordinary suggestion. He claims that there are whole communities of these Borrowers living underground. Hey, I've got the car. I'll be waiting for you. Thanks! You're amazing! 'Thanks, you're amazing!' Are you jealous?! - Hey, I don't do jealous. Right, if anything, he's probably jealous of me...if anything. Come on! I thought I'd never see you again! Pull! .. great warrens of them beneath our very feet as we speak. The implications of them are extreme... Thank you. Where are you going, boy? Pull! You gotta keep going! - I'm trying! You have secured the specimens? What is it? Why've you stopped pulling? - He's about to be seen! The beans are coming! - Are you sure? If she says so, I believe her. - Hurry! Pull! Oh! Where's my card?! Come on! - Oh, come on! Ah, it's no use! Hold him steady! GROAN What are you doing?! We can't give up now! We haven't got a choice! - Spiller! Hold him! Hold him! - Pull! SNIGGERS So you thought you'd get away, did you? See you around some time. - No, wait! Spiller! Get him, get him! Spiller! - Go! I'll be fine! Run! We'll be caught if we go back for him now. Run. We've got to go! Run! - No. This way, this way! Ha! Have you found him?! He's got to be there somewhere! Are you sure you know what you're doing? Homily, just let her get on with it. TYRES SCREECH Relax, stay calm. - Get us out of here now! Come on, you little beggars! Etty? No, I...I can't... I can't just leave him. He risked his life to save you. - We'll go back for him. But now, we really need to get out of here. The little swine. I suggest we get moving now! Etty, trust me, please. Right! TYRES SCREECH What? It's... They're getting away! Get that specimen! THE CAR BANGS ALONG THE VEN Oh, no! Disperse! Disperse! Get out of the way! Get out of the way. Come on, get out of the way! Oh, no! SCREAM Watch out! Get out the way! Ah! Stop that infernal contraption! No! MUZAK PLAYS What?! Arrietty, I think you've done really well, but I think your mother's right, and I think I should drive now. You two worry too much. LIFT DINGS SCREAM Someone stamp on it! Stop it! Somebody stop that! Somebody stop those wretched little creatures! Please! Stop, they're getting away! Oh! Somebody, please! Don't let them escape! No! No! Don't just jump out of the way! Stop that car! Etty! - It's all right, we'll fit underneath them. I don't think that's what your father's worried about! SCREAM No, no! Boy, stop! Stop, stop that boy! He's got... Come...come... Oh, God! SIGHS If anything's happened to Spiller... - He'll be fine. If Mildeye's got him, we're going back. Wait, something's happening. Thank you... Thank you all for your patience. Today, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to witness something truly remarkable. In years to come, this will be regarded as one of... the greatest discoveries in scientific history. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you... Homo sapiens redactus... .. Jacket. - CAMERAS CLICK LAUGHTER Yes, yes, I know, I know it looks like a doll's... jacket. Well, that's because it is a doll's jacket... Erm, I, I, I... I believe these creatures to be scavengers. Where... Where are you going?! Wait! The truth frightens you, does it!? You're scared of the truth! Well, I'm not surprised, because Homo sapiens redactus lives amongst us! You Philistines! Well, don't blame me, you go home and check your crawl spaces and skirting boards and your...and your attics, and when things go missing, don't come running to me because these people are watching us. And they're laughing at us. But I'll have the last laugh. I'll be vindicated! I will be vindicated! I will! These creatures do...ex... You really thought those clumsy beans had any chance of catching me? Spiller! I really thought you were dead. - No, not even close. HOMILY: AHEM! Sorry, I, um, just obviously, I'm glad you're safe. So you DO like me. - Thanks, Spiller. Just returning the favour. - If you hadn't done what you did... Maybe I had another reason. If I didn't do it, I wasn't going to get my reward, was I? What? Well, that was the deal, right? I get the coin. What, so that's the only reason that you did what you did? Well, no, but... I thought you were doing something noble, something brave. Hang on a minute, it was brave! Wait... Here, take your stupid coin. Excuse me, would you mind if I have a look at that? You know that was your mother's favourite toy? She used to play with it for hours. She used to talk to her dolls as if they were real people. I miss her. Yeah. So do I. Come here. It'll get easier. - Yeah, I know. Now all we need is somewhere to live. Yeah, I found the letter. You sneaky child! Sorry, we should've told you. Try not to worry, we'll sort something out. Not sure what yet. Might end up sleeping in a tent. Still, it'll be an adventure, won't it? What's that? How did this get here? A tie with an electric guitar on it! Just what I've always wanted! You're lucky I didn't knit you a sweater! Socks! You haven't even opened it yet. How do you know? I don't need to. Aunty Julie always gets me socks. Maybe this year it'll be something different. Pants! She bought me a pair of pants! - Ooh. Lucky old you. Ooh, choco-lattes. LAUGHS More chocolate. I just don't understand... How is it possible? I wonder where they've gone. There's no wrappers. It's like they've disappeared. What have? The strawberry creams. Every one of them's been eaten. Well, don't look at me. I like the purple ones. Penny toffee. Right, so if it wasn't either of you two and it wasn't me, who else could it be? You said I could have that coin. It wasn't ours to give... Remember, we don't take things. We borrow. Which means sometimes you have to give them back. No, it doesn't. That's a stupid idea. And keep her safe, I was told, and I get the coin! I kept her safe! Rubbish! I was the one looking after you! - What?! If it wasn't for me you'd have been sucked up into that machine. I'd have thought of something. Yeah, you'd have been shredded to pieces. It really wasn't as bad as it sounds. - Arrietty... Please, don't say I'm can't go out again. - I'm not going to. What? I was wrong. You've got a gift. We think you should be allowed to go out and use it. What? Go, go where? Anywhere you want. Back to the Underground, wherever you choose. But I've only just found you. We'll always be here. See you, squirt. - Thanks for everything, James! Take care. I'll see you soon. - Make sure you look after Spiller. Laters. I love you, Dad. Wooh! Try and be careful. - You know me. Woo-hoooo! # It's like easy come, easy go # Sometimes without goodbye Sometimes without hello # She's got one magic trick # Just one... # Merry Christmas!
