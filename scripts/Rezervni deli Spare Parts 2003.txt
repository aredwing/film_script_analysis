We've had more than 170 races in our town. Let's imagine the rich history of the speedway races in this stadium. Especially from the time when the winners on this track were Franc Babic, Kreso Omerzel, Ludvik Zajc. On the tracks in the stadium today, we once again have renowned international speedway racers from Australia, Argentina, England, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Italy, USA and Slovenia. Speedway is quite a festivity here in Krsko. That's how it's going to be today too. In this 2nd lap of the 20th race we see a fantastic pass by the American rider Greg Hancock, one of the best riders in the world. It's very tight here. Is the pass going to work out for him? And... he falls. The American rider Sam Ermolenko falls down. Dear spectators, the winner of the 20th race is greeting you. And please welcome him with a big applause! The American rider Sam Ermolenko is still on the ground. Dear spectators, dear speedway fans, this is the final race of today's best four riders for the winner of the Golden Sign. Among them there is also Gerhard More Geri from Krsko, Slovenia. Is Geri going to make it? The competition is great. It's just a few moments to the start. And... go! Whoo! Hi, I'm Rudi. - Got a driver's license? - Yeah. ...a home race, an excellent public, a good machine... is this the makings of a real sensation? Geri is still leading. I can't believe it! He's pressing his advantage. And... he wins! There's great enthusiasm in the stadium and incredible joy amongst the winning team that backed up the excellent performance of its rider Gerhard More Geri... - Whoo! Whoo! ...who's being lifted by his team. Are you scared? I don't know. A little. A man has to do what he's most afraid of. That's how he gets stronger. That's why Ludvik Zajc began racing, 'cause they used to pick on him at school and so I became a national champion. The first one in the independent Slovenia 199991. I know. I remember. I used to root for you. Everybody in Krsko rooted for me. Everybody in Krsko. Let's see how you're going to manage. - How have you been? - Cool. - Hi. - Hi. - Those two are Macedonians. - He's collecting the money. - 1000 euros. Counting, kid? - Yeah, yeah. Count if there's 2000. So, guys, where the fuck is the money? We don't have any more. That's all we've got. What the fuck do you mean, it's all you've got?! No money. The Croats crossed us. - What about the Croats? - They took double. - So? What do I do now? - Come on, let us go. Shit! All right, all right. I don't like Croats either. Croats are thieves. Come on. Get in. Easy! Come on, count it. Motherfuckers. Shh. Shit! Want a beer? The two Macedonians are without cash. Really? I want to go out a little bit. Where to? To Ljubljana. It's been a long time. I want to go to McDonald's. - To McDonald's? - Yeah. Ludvik Zajc wouldn't patronize the Americans if they paid me. Americans get on my nerves. You're not going anywhere. We're not on vacation. Shit, it stinks in here. We're hungry. We can organize pizzas for you. You've got to be kidding! What? You go and complain to the police, and they'll take you back from where you came, you Albanian dick. So? So, how many? What the fuck is with you? - One. - One. Pizza. Come on outside. Let's talk, yeah? - What's wrong with him? - He's got a fever. Are you hungry? Very hungry? Is it hard without money? Listen. Me and my friends are nice and clean people. We'll give you No one will give you more, you know. It's a pity. I'm not a bad guy. I made a friendly offer. Oh, whatever. Bring eight pizzas. I'll have one with ham and egg. Take care of the car, will you? - Okay. Bye. - Ciao. - And don't let anyone see you. - Okay. What's up with the Macedonian girl? - She's not hungry enough. - And the guy? The guy is all fucked up. He needs help. We can help. We've got some antibiotics. Good ones. American ones. Hmm? - Hi. - Hi. - How was it? - Great. - Ilinka is good? - She's great. Go on, kid. You go too. Where do I go again? Come on, kid. The girl needs cash. She offered herself for 50 euros. You're kidding me. She's not really in there, is she? Here you are. So she can earn something. We're checking you. To see if you're one of us. Go on. Go! Go on, go! Come on! - Go! - She won't bite you. Go on! Pull over. Cops are on the alert. They're everywhere. Take cover till the stench is gone, then our connection will come and get you, okay? Got you. I'm in the woods. Motherfuckers. If it gets tough, just run. - Where to? - Wherever, just away from me. What about the van? Don't worry. The boss will say it was stolen. - What about them? - What about them? Fuck. Cops make me fucking nervous! Motherfuckers. Police! Shit! Hush that kid or I'll do it! Now the police will fuck us like you fucked her! So you didn't fuck her? Answer me! Did you or didn't you? Answer me I said! Did you or didn't you? Did you hear me? Didn't you fuck her? Yes, I did. I just wanted to hear that. Why are you bothering me in the middle of this shit? I don't know what the boss was thinking, sending me such a pussy for help. Look at you. I sweat my ass off, losing my nerves because of them. Don't preach to me. I feel bad about it. Don't. Feeling bad is a waste of time. What's wrong with you? Most of these women end up being whores. - What did you think? - Shit. Half of them end up like spare parts anyway. What spare parts? What spare parts? For spare parts. On the Italian side they drug them and kill them they take out everything... heart, kidney, liver... anything you can transplant. One kidney is 15,000 euros. Are you fucking with me? We are tour guides in comparison with the other side. What's up, Marcello? Come on, go and open it. It was hard, but thank God... Come on, kid, stop dreaming. Let's go! Llinka! Llinka! What gets on my nerves the most is this globalization or... antiglobalization, whatever. You know, when Ludvik Zajc used to race, we would travel. When I got home I brought from Hungary the Pick salami and the "bull's blood" wine. Or to my mother-in-law I brought a Becherovka liqueur from Czechoslovakia or the Mozart chocolate rounds from Austria. And now, you get it all... and to my nephew... a Mrklin toy train set. Shit. And now... you get whatever the fuck you want in the shop next door. Fuck it! This is shit. Fuck. This fucking world is falling apart! Yes, it's shit. The whole world is one big hard piece of shit. Bravo, Rudi. You're right. Bravo, bravo, bravo. Earlier this morning there was a tragic accident at an illegal border crossing. A 23-year-old Macedonian girl died while a group of illegal immigrants tried to escape a police patrol. The girl fell off a cliff. The investigation will show if it was an accident or suicide out of despair. The immigrants have already been placed in the center for deportation of foreigners. They are going to be returned to the Croatian authorities. Last year 35,000 illegals were captured and in the first three months of this year by the Slovene police. And now the weather report. This afternoon it will be clear, partly cloudy. In the following days we expect clear and cold weather. Fuck, it's not accelerating like it should! Don't give me that! You don't have the guts. I'm joking, you're good kid. You need to work on your bend, lean backwards! - How was it? - Perfect Geri! Perfect! - Okay, Pigl, here's 200. - Hey, man, just 200? The boss said 200. Look how much money you have. And you give me just 200? Pigl, come on. Okay, but next time it's going to be 300. Bye. Come on, Pigl! - Are they all gonna fit? - Yeah, we can fit even more. Come on kid, close it up. Did I tell you that for four years Ludvik Zajc was a test smoker for a tobacco company? Every month they would send me and a questionnaire. I had to fill it out with information, like the combustion of the tobacco, humidity, taste, filter and all that stuff. Yeah, each month 3 boxes free. Ludvik Zajc was also an elementary school champion of rock 'n' roll dancing. In former Yugo. - Come on, you're joking. - Yes, yes. In 19977 in Tuzla. Bravo bravo bravo. Don't you stop in Ljubljana! We've got the deal down there. The warehouse is packed here. Got it? - Okay! - Bravo. - We are at the border, Rajc. - Yeah, here everything's cool, too. We're going to Ekrem's to eat burek later, okay? Are you buying? No problem. I'll also buy you a cold beer. Okay. Right on. Fuck, it stinks in here! You're all right, son. You're all right. Bye, stay cool! I tell you, when my son was born, he got on my nerves. - Mine too. - You must be joking! I'm not. Now he's 11 and I love him a lot. Good. Mine is still getting on my nerves. Ekrem! Give us more burek! I heard your wife died of cancer. What can you do? The guys from Ljubljana are fun, aren't they? They're cool, yeah. Wanna go to a party with me? The 45th anniversary of the Auto-Motor Club in Krsko. I don't know. I don't know anybody there. So what? I don't shoot shit with anyone myself. They are all drunk by now anyway. - Come on, just a drink. - I don't know. What's up with you? Are you embarrassed to be seen with me? Okay. Let's go! Yeah! Let's go! Hi, Ludvik! Good to see you. Pity you didn't make it to the celebration. Bravo. Good night. Are you still angry with everyone, or what? I've been working. I had better things to do than celebrating. Watch now! We all got a golden watch from the club, everyone except you. - Good for you. You too, Kreso? - Me too. Good. Good. Was it today? Yeah, today at the celebration. Who gives a shit, anyway? Fuck, Angela! You'll give me a blow job when I say so, not when you want to! Who are you? I'm from Kremen. I've moved to Krsko. I came with Ludvik Zajc. - You threw up? - Yeah. My eyes are all red. Shit, look at me. You look just great. Got a car? Thank you! Shit! You fucked up my zipper. What, what are you looking at? Nothing. Isn't it enough that you took advantage of me drunk? - You wanted it yourself. - Wanted it? Oh, sure. Is Ludvik Zajc your friend or what? Yes. He had cancer, didn't he? What, you didn't know? He's your friend all right. I didn't know. I know his wife... We've just become friends, you know. Don't you say anything about what happened here! - Bye. - Bye. - Darko, Darko. - Hi, Ludvik. What can I get you? Give me something to eat and a glass of wine. Good. Thank you. Did you fuck her? Who is she? A nice chick. She likes speedway. I didn't know you had cancer too. Are you all right now? Darko! Bravo. Me and Gisela got it almost at the same time. Only I made it, with urinotherapy. She wouldn't try it. Every morning I drank it on an empty stomach. My own piss. There's so much of it around here. It's because of the nuclear plant, I'm telling you. They say not much more than elsewhere. Yeah, right. You think they are gonna survive till London - stuck in there like this? - Most of them do. How long does it take to get there? I don't know. Two or three days. It depends. Say hello to the Queen! From whom? From a retired Slovene racer or what? I can see you are a very funny man. - Bye. - Bye. I've been calling her for two days and she doesn't want to answer me. Fucking bitch. - Ludvik Zajc? - Yeah, that's me. Smoking is strictly prohibited! I'm sorry. - Angela? - Yeah. - Hi, it's Rudi. - Hi. - Listen... - What do you want? I wanna see you. Urgent. Okay. Right. Come over now. I can't. I'm in Ljubljana right now. Okay. In one hour then. At the railway station. - Why at the railway station? - Because. I've got trouble with Geri. Okay. That's cool for me. The international train from Croatia going to Sevnica, Zidani Most, Ljubljana, Kranj, Austria is arriving at platform 2. The number is not available now. Please try later. You motherfucker! You let them go on the freeway! - You fucking idiot! - Who? You are asking who? These ones here! On the freeway! - These were yours I'm sure! - They were not, - I swear to God! - You fucking liar! Why don't you believe me? I took mine to the border! Don't you lie to me! Rajc told me he lost you somewhere on the freeway and you never called again! You motherfucker! I trusted you and you fuck it up like this?! I was in a shitty mood. I was shitting in my pants and I let them go there. What the fuck then? Don't do that, Rudi. It's not professional. Maybe it's better our cops caught them. Better than ending up like spare parts over the border or ending up like whores. Don't you ever fuck with me again! Understand? Got it? - Got it? - Yeah! You're not going to drive alone anymore. I don't give a shit... even if I never drive again. I won't have to put up with your farting anymore! Look at you! Look at the mess you live in! You stinking shit. At least I'm honest. I can look into anyone's eyes! My conscience is clean! What about you? - I'm not driving anymore! - I've got tears in my eyes! As if I didn't have dozens waiting to take your place! You jerk! Everyone pisses you off! That's the only emotion you've got anyway! What the fuck do I have to listen to you for? Who the fuck are you? Don't let me catch sight of you again! And don't you say a word to anyone, otherwise... I'll cut your balls off! I'll gouge out your eyes! Motherfucker! Then I'll wrap you up and I'll send you home to Mommy, you scumbag! You won't fuck with me anymore! What's up, guys? No action? No chicks? No action? Hey, everything's on me. For these chicks too! Here you are! Hi, legend! You're not asleep, are you? No. What do you want? I know I'm an idiot. But I'm sorry anyway. Did you want to tell me anything? Did you really fuck me over? - You're stupid, Rudi! - Yes, yes. Did you tell the boss? No. I don't have anyone else. I only have you. I'm sorry. Stop whining. Be a man! - Shit. I'm really sorry! - Come on. Don't you ever do that again! Understand? Yeah. Let's meet at the swimming pool tomorrow. We'll have a beer. At 11:00, okay? Great. Thanks. Again, I'm sorry. I told her I wouldn't go out with a bimbo like her. I told her to fuck off! Then she calls me, says she's going to slash her wrists. She can do it for all I care. Stupid slut. - Women are like that! - They're all the same! It came back. What did? Are you joking with me? Not now. What are you going to do? Well, I'll drink my own piss every morning... again. What can I do? After the race, we have a job to do. Good evening, Krsko! Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the final-race night of the Slovenian championship for singles. The competitors of today's final race are the best riders in Slovenia including our Krsko ace Geri More. - It looks like rain. - Naw. Are you sure? Absolutely. She was nuts about cream cakes. She died really young. Was it hard on her? It was quick. A couple of months. When she couldn't bear it any more, she committed suicide. Ladies and gentlemen, the rider in the white helmet is Gerhard Geri More from the AMC Krsko. In this final race, he's starting at position C. Is this the race of a new Slovenian champion? And the winner is Geri More, AMC Krsko! Gerhard More is the new Speedway champion! Not since Ludvik Zajc has the national championship gone to AMC Krsko! Well done! - What's up? - Nothing. Nothing? You've been working on her so long and there's nothing to say? So she'll have something to remember Slovenia by. When Ludvik Zajc used to race for Slovenia... to me and Krznaric they... Come on, Zajc. Give us a break. We've heard that a million times. I can't fuck black chicks. They don't turn me on. I'm gonna drive. Come on! Fuck! I can put seven, eight Chinese guys in there - without a problem! - Fuck them, the little shits! Motherfuckers! The boss said we're going to be driving in daylight more often. - Yes? - Yeah. Daylight is less suspicious. I read in the newspaper this morning that a refugee carried They also smuggle. Yes, all those fuckers who smuggle drugs ought to be killed! - All of them! - Those criminals! - What's up? - Where are you Rajc? I'm about to turn towards the border. - I'm already empty. - Okay. Wait for me there. - Why? - Just wait for me. - Everything okay? - Yeah. What are you doing here? - What's up? - "What's up?" Oh, shit. The jerks suffocated! What are we going to do now? Let's dump them in the water! - Come help me! - Come on, Rudi! Come and help me! Shit! - Come on, Drago, come on! - Yeah, I'm coming. Oh, fuck. - Gianni! - Hi! - Hi! What's up, Gianni? - You know. It's hard to be the only punk rocker in Krsko. Come with us. Have a beer! Some other time. I'm working tomorrow. Just one beer. I have to go to work at the factory. - Come on! - I've got to go. - Next time. Bye. - Yeah, right. - How was work today, guys? - We just got off, you know. Business is business. Ludvik, you are such a nice guy. Nice enough to marry. Come on Sonja. Stop messing around and give us two beers. No, I'm serious. Look! You're single, I'm a widow. Why don't we get married? We'd have one less problem. Sonja, you know how it is. At school dances, I never had a partner. What can you do? Once you're married, you're always married. I was just joking. Come on, guys, it's on me. Cheers. Cheers. What next? I thought we might be together. Now that Geri knocked you up, you want us to be together? - Geri says it's not his. - What do you mean? Well, he says he always pulled out in time. Spare me the details, will you?! I thought maybe you might have slipped that time? Now I'm guilty again, or what?! Oh, don't fuck with me! - How are you? - I'm okay. - I meant... - Oh, that. I wouldn't know. Even if I stop it now, I'll probably have to live with it inside me for the rest of my life. - You should stop smoking. - I did. Then I forgot I did. Oh, no, you did it again! What a stench! - Here's 300. - The daily fares are going to cost 400. Pigl, don't fuck with me. - Bye. - Bye. - Here I am again! - 1000! You already took me to the Italian border. But they caught me. - What the fuck can I do? - Remember? - That nice Macedonian girl? - Yeah, the Macedonian? Go on, get in! - Hey, boss! - What? - You know... - What? ...this kid, he's been dead for three days. - Are you fucking with me? - I swear! He's dead. He's started stinking. Get rid of him, will you? Come on, man! Shit. Shit. Shit. Who knows where that Macedonian girl is? I bet she's better off than she used to be. ATTENTION! BORDER CROSSING I pity them, all those who want to go to fucking Europe. - This shit is killing me! - What? Europe. I hope that as long as I live Slovenia doesn't join the fucking European Union. Yeah, then we'd be out of business. A united Europe was already Hitler's project. His methods were a little rough, but the goal was the same. They were pretty extreme! Yeah, what do you expect from an Austrian? Austrian?! I thought he was German! He was Austrian, 100%! A few moments till the start. And... go! - Hi. I'm Mare. - Hi! Got a driver's license? We leave at midnight. Branko Babic is still leading. A few meters to go. And the first to cross the lane is Branko Babic, Slovenia! So the story of the success goes on...
