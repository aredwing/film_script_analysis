You fool broad! Wtf? Would I take the huge television, many luggages and additionally her fatass for just one bang. Anyway Balkiz. Who cares if she waits. It is much better to be only with you, isnt it? We dont need this fatty Solmaz at all. To be honest, it is great to be with you, Balkiz.. For years, I have waited for this moment. You didnt know that, yet. You ask ''where do we go?''. I will show you my hometown Balkiz. Look! Austria, Jugoslavia, Bulgaria.. we have already passed over them. Just arrived! Turkey is here. Dont worry Balkiz. Look. The itchy minibus which annoys us on all the way is also here. And we park just next by it. Dumbass.. Hey! -Wtf ''cast'', twerp? -You were about to hit my car. Almost you had done it. Isn't it madam? -Keep your mouth clean before talking. you never met a woman in your life !?!. -Dont get me into trouble in first day. Fuck off! I am married to her! -If she is your wife,so this car is accounted of mine. And it costs to 10 wives. Keep in mind that, I wont let you hit. -Who hits your car! Mover over here, I will get away. -I dont move over anywhere -Do whatever you want, lets see that if you prevent me! -lets see. -why do they hash over there?

Where do you work in Munih? -in BMW. -How old are you? -In fact, I'm 32, but in passport, 23. In my place, we are always registered lately like this. -All you are same. You dont do anything legally. Where is your entrance visa? -All you are same. You dont do anything legally. Where is your entrance visa? -I dont know madam, how can I get it?

Bayram Unal! I dont confirm Bayram Unal's entrance! Dont do that sister,I please you to confirm the visa. Let me go to my village, let me see my uncle before he passes away. Who cares about your uncle! You even dont know how to behave in an office. I wont confirm your visa. Passport age and real age doesnt fit! Dont do that sister, what can I do here? -How long is your permission? -36 days ,sister! 3 days are already spent on the road. -If you exceed even half day when you turn back, I never confirm your checkout. -I promise that I wont be late. -scratched, crushed.. wrecked... Officer! Officer! I lodge a complaint that he scratched my car. -What is the problem? Who did it? -The minibus which had graffitis and figures on. He scrateched my car. -Cruel man! He made it intentionally. I complain him! -Whom do you complain abou, man? Do you know his name and plate number? and who knows that he did? -I see that with these eyes! He did it. -Is there any witness? How comes! Now, we will access to second control point,Balkiz. Yeah, this is Turkey. Whether they control so strictly or they do nothing. -Do you have any extra luggages? -I have nothing apart from my 'Balkiz' Look there. Veli is also here. Besides, they pick Solmaz too. it seems that they drove faster than me. -please, let one of them remain with us. -No, impossible. Put all of them inside. -You know that our permission is so short! -Bring them inside!! -Mum, Look! Bayram uncle is there! -To hell with him! Solmaz looks so upset. Balkiz, I met Solmaz in Veli's house in Munchen. Let me introduce you with Solmaz, Bayram. She is so nice. Pleasure of Mercedes's star is undefinably delighting. If Kezban had been next by me now. If she had seen that I am on driver seat of my Balkiz. She would say '' you are more brave than I expected. I didnt fall in love with you to no avail.'' Kezban.. How are you? Do you remember that you visited me in Ankara? I was so surprised Kezban! welcome. You made me surprised. After military service done, you didnt come back to village. So i wanted to see you. I was in need of money. So I began to work. How are you? -No longer, I am living in Ankara. -Ankara? Yes, I stay with my brother. Looking for job. -Hereafter, we can meet more. -Look. You like this cassette alot. Come here, I wait for you! -I would like to take a boat trip with you but... -it doesnt matter. we better walk. -I would like to offer a cup of tea to you, but, tea sucks here. -Do you want simit, Bayram? hey kid, can you give me 2 simits? -No need to buy that. I am not hungry, but thank you. -what do you plan to do in Ankara? It is hard to find a job. -I already found. I am working as a cleaner. -Oh, how quick! -But I will give up soon. Next month, I will start as a housemaid, staying with family. -So will it be better? -Sure. Also, my boss will let me to attend to sewing classes in evening. -Sewing class? -Yes. My brother knows a clothing manufacturer. If i succeed in education, he will recruit me in his business. -Congrats Kezban! I m proud of you. You really made me surprised. -Soon, I will go to Germany. -Germany? you never told about that before. -Are you a man, Bayram? you vulgar! it seems that they retained your television in customs. Dont you know that if I am man or not! Viva Balkiz! Thank you that I could strip Solmaz owing to you.. I couldnt have seen a pair of boobs for such a long time. I compelled Balkiz extremely, but she is still perfect. you PIMP! son of bitch! come brother, come in here. Ok brother, please come back. come back. Thats enough. Now turn right please. Go ahead like this. welcome dear brother, good luck with it. -your car looks so beautiful. Thanks bro, I bought it recently. I hope Allah gives you same too. -Insallah, and the weather is extremely hot today. -yes, but my car didnt have any overheating and water boiling problem, Masallah! Just temperature gauge needle increased a bit, thats all. -can you please move over there? Car will be parked there. - It can be parked, I dont prevent anyone. he can park here. -If you move over, he can park comfortly. -But,already there will be a space like this between my car and his car. He can park in remaining space. -Go to hell! Hey brother why dont you move over there? Is it your father's parking lot? -But its already so narrow, it shouldnt be parked like this. How can I get in my car then? Oh my God! How precious car you have! ugh! Oh I miss my home meals so much that... please Bayram, try to be self-possessed and economical. Dont forget that you dont have much money.. -Welcome -I have stomach problem now, so I cant eat much. Please bring me soup and some yoghurt. In any case, I will be in village by evening. I can eat well there. Before arriving to village, I should wash Balkiz very well. -Hey staff! The star of my car is lost. -Which star? -Wtf "which star"? The star on the hood of car. It is not there. -I dont have any idea if where it is. -How comes? where is my star? -I dont know! -Aren't you the staff of this parking place? -you are responsible for my star. where is my star? -I didnt see any star. I didnt take anything! -Its possible that you pilfered it. you were jealous of my car. -fuck off crazy! -Hey look! I wont give it up easily. I order you to give my star back! -take your hnds away froom my arm. I dont care about you. -Ofcourse you will. Where is my star? -go to hell to look for your star. give it to me bub! it will be bad for you if you dont give. -lets see what will happen. -I hit you. -Just try and see the result, you crazy! Star is snatched.. What a country! People dont see any star in their life. and they say " it is just normal, take it easy!". Fuck this normality! Shit! Just missed the gas station! Hurry Balkiz! it is not such a deal to overtake other cars like this. Eww! there are donkeys in gas station. Moreover, it is not a European brand. I wont fill domestic to Balkiz. What will i do now?also I dont have spare gas. I cant stop here. If only, I had stopped in this gas station with donkey. you idiot Bayram! Please help me some to push the car there. I came without any filling from Yugoslavija. Just waited for high quality gas. Its your luck! What a nice car! Both good for seller and buyer. Purposely,they do it. I restrain my passions and lived self-denial for years to afford Balkiz I wouldnt be able to afford if I didnt go to Germany. Even so, You made a good job, Bayram! You went by train, now you return by Mercedes. It is miraculous. -Good luck! I wish all of them can succeed! -Do you also have someone in this train? -Nope, I will go. But my departure date is two days later. Just in case, I have come earlier. I have to keep my powder dry. -It seems that you are not from Istanbul. -I am from a village in Ankara. -Will you stay in train station for 2 days? -Sure, I can. No matter if I go to Germany at the end. Beware! Be careful, Bayram. I do hope you wont hurt Balkiz! -Welcome dear landowner. -Thank you. How are you? -Thank you,landowner. We are fine , thanks to God. -Rustem, yours is tampering with car again. -Bayram. Dont touch the car. Fall away there. -Yes, kids. Go away around car.. Kezban, come here. Was it a nightmare? Slow down, Bayram. Slow down..Let them go. What a chance for you! You are so lucky to overtake a Mercedes. What does he look for? Race? Aha! Enough! Hurry Balkiz! Ohh! Just get off lightly. Viva Balkiz! You proved that how Mercedes you are!. If there was any other brand in this situation, I was dead now. Aha! now you are here. you dumbass! you idiot. Dont you know what Mercedes is? This lesson will be enough for you. -Good afternoon. Driving licence and passport, please? -Just a minute, policeman. Everything is alright. -If only, you had stopped this minibus. He drives crazily. -Can you please come with me to policecar? -me? -yes, you. -All licenses are okay, commissar. -Speed limit is 50km/h but your speed is 120 km/h. -How comes? I didnt realize any sign. -If you were careful, you would see. -Sorry, commissar. Fatigue should be the reason. I am driving from Germany. Please forgive. -You should come to police office. Your car will be driven by policeman. -I bet that I wont do mistake again. just oversight. -Let me go to see my uncle before he passes away.. Already, I hurry up because of this. I dont have anyone closer than my uncle. I am orphan. Shit. Tons of payoff I paid. I already dont have much money. In village, I cant borrow any as A mercedes owner. No race anymore, Balkiz. we dont care if they beat. they have much money. They are not streetcleaners in Munchen roads like me. Who knows that they live in Europe for long years. they saved much more than me. I am newbie, yet. What a mean commissar! why didnt he forgive? What ashame! Anyway. Do whatever you want! Sure enough that I am working in Germany. Can he never afford a Mercedes? Who cares if he is policeman. Must be crazy. Dumbass, just standing under water. Anyway Balkiz. Time to concentrate on driving. Holy Shit. they are dumbled. Why didnt I stop? It seems, when I didnt take her, she called Veli. Veli is such a stupid. Why do you carry her even while you have many things in your car? If you hadnt accepted her, you wouldnt have had accident now. Though I annoyed Solmaz, I behaved most properly again. Anyhow. I dont care if she gets mad at me. Everyone work for themselves in this life. Who cared about Bayram till now? So, why should Bayram care about others? We gather with other Turks in my house by this evening. If you like, join us. It will be enjoying. Loneliness spoil when you live abroad. -Thanks Veli. Anyone except you, doesnt ask Bayram how he is. I have a pity on Veli. He wasnt next by car,too. Certainly, he went to ask for help. Who knows that how many people died once again. If only, I checked the tyre condition in gas station. There are many accidents on the road. - Now, we approach to Istanbul. So I will be able to come in Istanbul by Mercedes. Kezban, this victory is ours. Kezban, dont be in doubt about that I will forget you in Germany. Absolutely, you will come there. Promise! Man's Promise. Here is the sea. Look at the sea! Look at that, Balkiz! I give my life for its blue! hey! -Do you want me to fill up? -Nope, I have gas. just check tire pressure. -Left taillight is broken, brother. -What did you say? -Left taillight glass. It is broken. -Where? How did it happen? Possibly, it happened when I stopped suddeny because of footballer. I heard as a smash from backside. First star, second taillight. Wtf? -Excuse me. How can I go to autopart shops? -Do you have Mercedes star and taillight? -There is no star. -We had stars in stock but now over. They are usually stolen. There is star shortage, nowadays. -You cant find what you look for. -Both of them are in stock. You shameless! I just came from its origin. He asks tons of money for such simple things. Anyway Balkiz, we have go to village without star and taillight. What a pity. Me and Balkiz cross the Bosphorus bridge without star and taillight.. In spite of everything, it is still great. I promise you Balkiz, next time, we will cross together with Kezban. Kezban will also love this. Right, Kezban? -I challenge you to run. -I am in. -Does it hurt? -I fell on my arm. Well, our love story begins like this with Kezban , Balkiz. you lummox! Do you sleep there? Whew! How I space out. Kezban just blindfolded me. -Kezban. Why are you here? Others will realize me. Go away! Dont spoil my plan. -I am going to city-centre to look for job. go away! I was leaving my village I didnt tell any word to my uncle before leaving.

We can work here together. -Every sheep is hanged from its own leg. (Everyone is responsible for his own actions.) -And, I am already registered to this job. What can I do? Life is hard. You will walk and never look behind... -You become so cheesy, Bayram! You fool Bayram. You hurt Balkiz because of Kezban. Due to absence of mind, you spoil everything. -You must see Ahmet's new apartment. It s so large and luxurious. Fully vinly floor covered. Double bathroom covered with marble. -There is also seasight. -Who knows how expensive it is! he should pay thousands of dollars. -Everyone can get the money in a way, so they dont care about its price. How much is an apartment like they mention? more expensive than Balkiz? No way.. If I want to change Balkiz to an apartment, anyone would accept that. But I dont want. I am not satisfied yet.. -Excuse me, Your blouse is so beautiful. Where did you buy? -Store in Kadikoy. -I have seen another dress with this fabric, but this style is much better -Thank you OMG! How can I resist now? what a nice woman. She doesnt look like neither Kezban or Solmaz. I couldnt even touch Kezban. You cant do anything before marriage. But this woman is extremely hot. Should I come closer now? Certainly she is from Istanbul. Ohh, look that beauty! If she had known that the Mercedes,seen below, is mine, she would like to sleep with me immediately. Then I will bang her promptly. Yes Bayram, right now! Uhh. Just missed it. Taking the lighter, I should say '' Excuse me madam. Can I light your cigarette?'' If I say something, will she rebuff? No way. I am a Mercedes owner, she cant refuse me. I dont want to disturb you, but can we talk some? Excuse me, I tried to light your smoke but I was a bit late. My mind is always with my Mercedes. I was looking at it if there is any problem. -Who cares? -Do you have a car? -Eww. I wanna stand alone. -What happens if we just chat. I am driving lonely from Germany. -From Germany? -Yes. From Munchen. I have been there for 3 years. I am Bayram, and yours? -What is your profession there? -I am working in BMW, assembly line. Just few people are selected for this job. yours? -I am manicurist. -Which one is your Mercedes? -Seen below, honey-colored. -I would buy brand new one but next year I will hopefully. What was your name? -Ayfer is my name. -No need to thank, Ms. Ayfer. I will already pass over Bursa. -My car is like a large saloon. And lonely driving is also boring. -And it is a pleasure for me to travel with such a beautiful lady. -you will agree with me that it is so comfortable. I can also take you to your house. -Come in Ms. Ayfer. Destiny intersect us. -Waiter, bring us 2 cups of tea. I have a guest. -You attract me alot, Ms. Ayfer. -What are you doing? Take your hands away. -Dont worry. Anyone doesnt see us. -Hey, you hurt me! go away. dont touch me. You stinkpot! -Dumbass! -You animal! Pimp! Son of bitch! First learn how to behave a woman before inviting to your car. -Give my luggages right now. -Hey woman! you messed it up! You destroyed my Mercedes's door. -Who cares with your car door, dumbass! Give me luggage right now, or I will call police. -You animal! -You are animal, woman! If you werent, you had known how to open a Mercedes's door. -I know how to shut your mouth up! Give my luggages! -Please stop arguing lady! Eeew! You Germanist, are you fascist? -Give the luggages back now, give! - Take them away! What is my business with them? -Come, brother. Come this way, drive, drive. -Keep going, brother. Keep going like this. Thats okay. Drive like this. -No problem, brother. You just gas! In order to afford Balkiz, I have postponed all my desires. Work! Work! Work! Dont spend any penny, just save. Dont spend even for women. So, whenever I see a pair of nice breasts, I control myself. Anyway Balkiz. We arrive home, soon. Just about to complete the race. Well Kezban. There is a saying '' Road ends up, but love never.'' Coming, coming! Bayram is coming! -Congratulations Bayram. -Viva Bayram! Good job! -What a proud to see a Mercedes owner in my village! -Bayram is our pride! -You beat all of us,cousin. -I am proud to raise you up,my nephew! Come to Germany and learn how to cover with asphalt! You fucked up my car. -There is an increase of domestic cars. It would be better if I bought Balkiz earlier. But it was impossible. If I hadnt come across with Ibrahim, I wouldnt even have gone to Germany. -Bayram. -Hey, Ibrahim. What do you do here? -What a chance! I would never expect to meet you in Ankara. -Why did you come to Ankara? -I am going to Germany, Bayram. -Germany? -Yes, sure. There is priority for members of ''Village Development Cooperation'' So I have registered there -Is there ''Development Cooperation'' in our village? -Nope, I registered next village's cooperation. -If you pay the money, they accept any application. -I never heard that. But how did you get money? -My father sold some part of fields and half of the cattles. -So, is everything ok now? -It seems so. So I came to Ankara. -They ask for ''Health Certificate''. You faggot! Faggot! Stop here! Just get out of the car. You made crack on my Mercedes's windshield. It is because of the spattering stone by you. Pay it! -You will pay it! It is my elbow grease! -You will pay it. You will pay it, twerp! Ruthless dick! He hit so badly. It is my fault. Why did I drive so closely to truck? -Hey driver, we trust you with our lives. -Firstly, you trust Allah, sir. I am driving for years, but look at him! He drives crazily. He is crazy! What a shame? I worked for years just to buy Mercedes, then others piss on it. -We should hang him as exemplary. -Just Germanist! -Uncouth! -Please dont bust up, driver! Dumbass! I have headache of starving. Here is famous for kofte I hope it is not so expensive. I already wont eat much Hurry Balkiz -Come in, brother. -Do you cook kofte quickly? I must hurry. -Cookstove is just turned off. I can prepare something different if you like? -I am coming from Germany. Dont find excuses, please give me kofte. -Extra onion and pepper.. and bring yoghurt too.. Excuse me, I park my Mercedes in front of you, but I wont stay so long. -I think of your health certificate. It can last for weeks. -You dont need to stay here for weeks. -I am already living here, I can deal with your documents -Wheneever I get the documents, I will post them to you. -By the way, you can spend your time with family before going to Germany. -You are right, Bayram. I hadnt thought like this. -I will miss my family so much. - I dont know when I can see them next after I go to Germany. -Dont worry about documents. Go and enjoy with your family. Also, you ask Village Cooperation about my situation. -Maybe I can also attend there. -Why not Bayram? -But, can you get the money? -I will try to borrow. -And you already go to Germany. You will earn a lot there. -Can you lend me some? After I come to Germany, I can pay back. -Kofte was delicious. Bring me the bill, and direct me to a barber -Be careful, young man. Bowl will fall off. -If you had an apprentice, it would be better. -Before, I had one. After meal, I am so drowsy now. Eschew to sleep, Bayram. Otherwise, he will scar your face up. I wish uncle is still alive. He was seriously ill. -Hey uncle, you scar my face. -How can I shave if you sleep on armchair? Ah Kezban! You should see what comes over me just because of you. You asshole! Fuck off! Well Balkiz. After here, it is my land. Soon, I will be reunited with Kezban Possibly she is in village now, waiting for me. Yasar brother would inform her about my arrival. -Kezban quit textile job. -Quit? Why? -Once, foreman asks her to clean his house. Then she refused to be charwoman, and quit. -So? What does she do now? -Now, she is janitor in a bank. -Congratulations Kezban! She is so honored. -Somehow, I couldnt visit her. But, hopefully I will go there by car. Blending period is over. So stalks are burned. When I was a child, I just wanted to have toy train. My homeland doesnt look like yours, Balkiz -Please, dont do it, uncle. Please.. -An aged horse is useless, my nephew. -Is it so easy to feed all of you? -Please uncle, I beg you. Dont kill him. -No avail to cry, Bayram. I cant feed him for no reason. Don kill him. I will feed him, -I will pick hays for him -I hope you are okay. Do you need help? -No, it is not important. Fuck off, I wont let you touch my Balkiz.. What a Mercedes! The highest quality, the best of all Mercedes'. No needed to worry if it is a Monday car or Friday car. The things that come over us are so tragic, Balkiz. Ibrahim should curse for my cruelty. -Health certificates are not ready,yet. Visit us two days later. -Recep Tokgoz. Please tell if my health requirements are okay. -It is prohibited to inform before signing them. -What happens if he had just said. I am so curious. -Thankfully, I am healthy, but maybe a misfortune occurs. -Take it easy man. -I am waiting for my friend, Ibrahim's certificate. -I already said to come two days later, ok? Gas is about to end up. And, It is so hard to find Euro-gas around here. -Your car is so frazzled, friend. -You cant imagine whaat happened just before. -However, it is a great car. It is still running. -The rest can be repaired easily. Pessinus. What is Pessinus? Wrong direction? Of course not. This is my village direction. This wasnt here before. What a nice farm. What does it mean? -Eww! Mercedes is terribly destroyed. -Why is that car here at that time? -I think it goes to Pessinus, mum. Spring water turned into fountain. Is Ibrahim, whose name written on fountain, Kezban's brother one? He was so stubborn like his sister. Will he make trouble for me? If Kezban wants to marry me, what can he say then? If not, I will promise him to find a job in BMW. Surely, I will do my best. I will become his sister's husband. It snot so bad for engagement, is it? I also bring a scarf for her. Is that a devil? How can he come here? -Hello. Your car looks fatigue. -It doesnt matter. Not so important. -Do you live here? -I am from Cakmak village. -Ismail's wife was from Cakmak village. He had a sister, named Kezban. -How do you know, Kezban? -I am their nephew. -Did you come here for digging? -Digging? -Poyrazkoy is digged. -Poyrazkoy? Who? Why? -They make archealogical digging. There are many tourists, nowadays. -The name of village turned into Pessinus. -What the hell do you tell? Is Poyrazkoy ''Pessinus'' at all? -There is no village anymore. All of them are sent away by government. -just because of old stones, all people moved out. -So, did Rustem uncle and his son also move? -Rustem uncle died. One week ago he passed. -On his last day, he said that ''I should survive till my nephew comes.'' -As I heard, Bayram is his name. It is said, he went away to Germany. -And he set all people quarreling in village. But what is problem if he went to Germany? Many people went there. -Do you know Ibrahim from Poyrazkoy? -Ibrahim? -Ibrahim trusted in Bayram about Germany. -He said Bayram ''You get my health certificate and send me.'' -The certificate which is sent by Bayram was inconvenient for Germany. -All Ibrahim and his family scattered. And his father passed away with grief. -Well, but if Ibrahim is ill, what can Bayram do with it? -Ibrahim brother heard everything about this certificate. -This faggot Bayram, bribed officer to change the health certificate. -Also, in employment agency, he cheated others and pretended to be as Ibrahim. -Lie! Ibrahim was not healthy! -How do you know? When Ibrahim learnt the truth, immediately he went to bank where Kezban works. -and explain everything to her. -Miserable Bayram! Dont shout Kezban. People hear us. -Who cares! Enough! How can he do that? -Son of bitch. pimp! I spent my life for him -Bayram, are you man? -Anyone couldnt make Kezban calm down. -Bank manager fired her immediately. -But, where is Kezban now? -She is married someone, who was in love with her for a long time. -and now she is pregnant. -I must go now, brother. -I am so familiar with your face, but anyway. Bye.
