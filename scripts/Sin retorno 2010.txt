Why? Where are you going? A party. -Where? -In the city. Whose party is it? Mum, can I use your car? Sure. Shit! -Have you cut yourself? -It's okay. Hi. -How about a kiss? -Pee! -Hi. -Hi. Why are you eating like that? What was that mask? My dad sent it. Yes, he asked if you'd got the parcel. I'll ring him later. He sent an inflatable dinghy too. And I got a new suitcase. We have to take an inflatable dinghy? Ask Malena that. Why are you having supper so late? I had to stand in for Gordo, and I still have one more. -What time will you finish? -Late. Don't wait up. Dad... I'd better be going. One last drink? No, I'm off. I'm tired out. There were a lot of papers in the closet. Mostly yours. I left them out for you. See if you want them or I'll throw them out. I don't know... Throw them all away. LEVIATHAN It was among all that stuff. I'll get something to put them in. Okay. Don't throw anything away. I'll look through them some time. So it's question and answer time: for instance, mathematics. Hi, sweetie. What are you doing? - Questions and answers? -Yes. How much do you charge? To win a woman's heart, Rogelio, you have to say things to dazzle her. Understand? -Flashlight! -No! Things to knock her out. -Sledgehammer! -No. Say something with love. - Clove! -No! That guy there is the girl's boyfriend. Watch out for him after the show. - You fucked up, man. -Why? I get to hide in the case. It's you who did the talking! Well? Not cold enough... or it's too sweet, I don't know. Just leave it to me. -Hi. -Hi. "Structure 2", right? I have a serious problem... I just ruined the party. I need to go home for the mixer. Okay. I'll wait here. -Hi. -Hi. They'll kill me. I broke the mixer and the party only just began. You can drive me home or give me the keys? Choose. Hi, sweetie. Have you finished? How long will you be? Why are you talking like that? Malena's in bed. Why aren't you back yet? How long will you be? I'm... five breaths away. Five breaths and some chocolate. Then that's ten breaths. No. -It's Pollo. -What does he say? "Buy ice, urgent. " Must have more mixers to break. You're a real scream! That's right! That girl was really pretty. -From school, right? -Yes. I think she did "Structure 2" with us. How is it working out? Well, considering I'm going to your place right now to get a mixer... What do you think? Somebody recommended a beach near Floripa. "Morro de... " something or another. Praia do Morro. I told you I'd found it on the Internet, remember? There are some great pictures of it. Hey, man! Fuck you! Bastard! How come you don't know the girl's name yet? You've got a nerve. -Dragging me away... -You ought to know her name. You cheeky bastard. She better still be there. Women love mystery. We'll get back to the party, she'll wonder where we've been... -She'll be intrigued. -What are you talking about? You were behind the bar. I downloaded this drink recipe. If you both try it, she'll be yours. Right... -What's the matter? -I dropped it. You dropped the cigarette? Stupid! No... lift up the carpet. I'm so tired, my love. Hold on, I'm only two breaths away. Love you. Love you too. It's my Mum's car, dammit! Look for the smoke! Was it lit? -It was probably out. -There, there! For fuck's sake! You are so stupid! Always the same! It wasn't that serious. Are you okay? You fucked it up! But are you okay? Yes, but you've really fucked up my bike. Oh! Oh, God! There's road work. I had to swerve and suddenly your bike was there. You haven't even said sorry for fucking it up. You son of a bitch. Look what you've done! But it was your fault. You were in the middle of the road! My fault? Fuck you! And you go fuck yourself! -You're crazy. -Fuck that! Get out of the fucking car! Go fuck yourself! Get out, you sissy! Fuck you! Motherfucker! Don't touch him. I'm shattered. The last performance really took it out of me. Shitty audience too. You took a long time. Let me sleep, Fede. This isn't what I was promised. What about the chocolate? There isn't any. There was this idiot with a bike. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow. What are you doing like that? Another Sunday you'll be sleeping all day. You're dripping water everywhere, Matias. Somebody stole the car. What? Yes... -It was nothing... -Are you okay? They opened the door, pulled me out and drove off, that's all. -Did they hurt you? -No, I'm okay. I'd just dropped Chaucha off and I stopped at a red light. There were two of them, one on each side. They pointed a gun at me and pulled me out of the car... -Don't worry. -It's okay. The main thing is you're okay. - Yes, it was nothing. -The car's insured anyway. I'm going to bed. No, no, Mati. Go and put some clothes on. -We'd better go to the police. -Why? To report it. -Me? -Yes. But the car's in Mum's name... -Quiet, she's asleep. -Can't you go? I need to get some sleep, Dad. Matias, it'll only take five minutes. Then you can come back and sleep. So... "At the intersection, the victim stopped at a red traffic light. " Then two men appeared, one on each side, pointed a gun at me, opened the door, pulled me out... and drove off. Time of the incident? Half past two. Did they take anything else? Yes, my wallet. Describe the thieves, -please. -No... it was very dark. And fast, I didn't get to see their faces. "Unable to describe facial features... " One more thing. What colour is the vehicle? Blue. -I asked you a question before. -No... -Had you been drinking or not? -No... And you asked me if I'd had a lot to drink. I hadn't. And what's the fucking difference? Don't take that tone with me! You come home in the middle of the night, half-naked, carrying your clothes... No wonder I ask questions and worry about you. I've been calling you for the last half hour. Come on or we'll be late. -You're going? -I can't miss it. Thanks for looking at it. I'll come back after the holidays... What happened? An idiot with a bike in the middle of the road. It'll be some time. I've got a backlog of work. Everybody seems to need something doing... -This time of year. -It's okay. We're taking a coach in a few hours' time. I'll be back in a fortnight. I'll see what we can do. We won 2-1. I had to report it in the end. My dad took me in. What did you say? What we agreed to say. Did you tell your dad? No, I said I wouldn't. It's better this way. Come on, the taxi's ready and so am I! Hurry up! This can go in there. That's it. Fede. How many bags are we taking? The bus won't move... We haven't forgotten anything, have we? I'll have to carry all that later. Bye, house! - Come on. -I'm coming. Off we go. -Right then... -Let's go. Hurry up! Get a move on! You've been in there for two hours already! Hurry, up! I want to go to bed! Talk to him! Will you be long? Just finishing. Move them to the afternoon and the rest tomorrow. Yes. Who's left? A root canal? Tell her tomorrow if she can. Ah, yes, tomorrow. Fit him in too. Pass me the leisure pages, Dad? I'll finish and give you all of it. Did you ring about the insurance? No but I downloaded some forms I'll have to fill in. Matias, can you take the envelope downtown? I'll give you the address. -How long till they pay up? -A month, I suppose. Can't they make it sooner? -We'll have to ask. -Do that, please. Me? -Why does it always have to be me? -Let's not go on about who has to do what all the time, please. I'm not going on, Laura. Why do I always have to do all the paperwork? Shall I list all the things I do every day? ANOTHER CASE OF HIT-AND-RUN DRIVING But it's always me! That's not true. -The one time I ask you! -The one time? Like the bank... one time. Chaucha. Chaucha! -He's alive. -I know. Let's go to the stairs. Well? Chaucha. -What shall we do? -I don't know. We did it all wrong. They'll find the car. -No, they won't. -What if they do? They won't find it. -What if he saw me? -No. "No"? What if he saw me? He'll recognise me. Stop it. Anyway, there's nothing we can do. If you want to talk to me, call me on my mobile. We have to sit tight and wait now. And keep a low profile. I have to go back now. My mobile... Hello? -I called and got the answering service. -I can't find it. -When did you last use it? -I don't know. -Yesterday? -No. -At the match or after? -No. Last Saturday, I texted you about the ice. Last Saturday... Shit, Chaucha! When I got out of the car, I must have dropped it. Sure you didn't use it after? No, I didn't. I must have dropped it in the road or in the car! -Have you looked at home? -Didn't you hear what I just said? I've looked everywhere! And I have to find it! How is Pablo doing? They're following his progress. Actually they need to operate but they said they have to wait. Thank you, Victor. Thank you. The doctors say he's in criticaI condition but they haven't lost hope. We'Il let you know if there's any news. Thank you, Maria Julia. YOUTH REMAINS IN CRITICAL CONDITION Fucking shit! -Hi, Victor. -Hi, guys. -Mate? -Thanks. Thanks. See you later. Yes? The... toilet? There's a men's toilet along the corridor and down the stairs. Hello, dear. I've come to see Matias Fustiniano. Your brother, right? As I was saying, this is just routine procedure. A couple of questions the insurance company always asks after robberies. Perhaps you can tell us what happened, Matias. I'd stopped at... I told the police all this. I'd stopped at a red light when two men appeared, one on each side, armed... Before I knew it, they opened the door, pulled me out, got in and drove off. You did well not to put up a fight. That's where -insurance companies come in. -That's what I always say. Things can be replaced. People can't. Right, were you wearing your seat belt at the time? - Yes. -So... two men came up, from the left? No, one on each side. They tapped the window with the gun barrel. Each one tapped a different window? No, the window on my side. The one who opened the door? Yes. And pulled me out. But weren't the doors locked? No. Strange because it says here that the Atos has an automatic locking system that works just after the engine's started. Hadn't you taken Chaucha home? Yes. So you unlocked the doors then? -Chaucha... -He's a friend. I took him home before I came home myself. Fine. Did they steal anything else? My wallet was in the car. And my mobile. It was there too. I forgot to tell the police. So you were saying... -the one opened the door. -Yes. -And? -They pulled me out. How did they pull you out? They grabbed hold of me, pulled me out and threw me to the ground. So easily when you had your seat belt fastened? Actually, he doesn't usually use it. But is that really so important? Not really but as I said, it's routine procedure required by the insurance company before they pay compensation. Anything else you need to know? No. Not for now. I may have to bother you again at some time in the future. Meanwhile, thank you for your time. You didn't say they took your mobile. No... it was in the car and I forgot. You'd better tell the phone company. I already did. What about this? Weren't you going to take it in? We want your mum's car back asap. I told you they were expecting this, Matias. Why didn't you give it to that guy from the company? First because you said you'd taken it in. And second that "guy" is the insurance adjuster and has nothing to do with the papers. Are you listening to me? Yes. I'll take them in now. No problem. Matias. Look what I found. Matias. What's the matter? What's the matter? What's the matter? It wasn't my fault. It wasn't my fault. Matias... what's the matter? I killed him. I didn't see him. I don't understand. What do you mean? What are you trying to say? What are you trying to say, Matias? The car... wasn't stolen. The guy was in the middle of the road. Almost lying on the ground, I didn't see him and I hit him. I looked for a phone to call an ambulance... I wanted to go back but I couldn't... Why didn't you tell me all this before? Why didn't you tell me before? And I left the car and came home. Then that man from the insurance came and he realised everything. So we filed a false report. I'm scared! I didn't know what to do and I'm scared! I know... -I want this to be over. -There, there... Let's... Let's... Let's go to... to the police station and tell them... I want this to be over. I can't go on. Let's go and tell them what happened. I want this to be over. Make it be over. Make it be over. Have you told anyone else? No. Are you sure? Chaucha? Anyone? No. I'll ring Carmona, see if I can get him at this time. Just trust us. Now try and get some sleep. Which one? Four. Landivar, right? Okay. I'll be there in an hour. Well, at the moment there are no real clues or witnesses. And they don't think there will be. But the police are still investigating? Now that it's homicide, maybe. In cases like this, any evidence not found immediately is usually lost. The first 24 hours the police look for witnesses. -What do they do after that? -Not much. Without witnesses they usually file the case. So? In cases involving road accidents, when the culprit gives himself up, the result is usually a suspended sentence. Or a driving ban in the worst case. However, with the coverage this case has had in the media, it's important to bear in mind that if Matias were found guilty, he might be sentenced. To jail? Yes. We're talking about three years and a half, maybe more. Even five. Is there no other way? I've seen cases where no witnessed turned up and where the main evidence... the vehicle... disappeared. If the case isn't solved in 5 years, a statute of limitations comes into play. Yes? Hello. Excuse me. I just wanted to ask... -Did you see anything last Saturday? -Saturday? -Yes. -Who is this? I'm Victor Marchetti, the father of the boy who was run over. I'm trying to find out if anybody saw anything or can help. No, sorry. We were asleep and didn't see or hear anything. Well, thanks anyway. Er, excuse me... Do all the "A" flats face the street? Yes, and the "B"s too. Good luck. Thanks very much. Stay close to me. ROAD CLOSED What shall I do? Pour some on the front where the dent is. I wish you luck. It's such a shame. -Thank you very much. -A pleasure. Mister! You're the father of the kid with the bike? Yes. Someone at the news stand said you were asking questions. I've been wanting to talk to you but I didn't know where you were. Did you see something? No, but that night I was crossing the road and there was a car... that almost ran me over. They were racing down the street. I don't know if it helps. But it could have been around that time. -Did you see the number plate? -Part of it. The times we've reported things like that but they never do anything. -What about the make or the colour? -The make, yes. Go to your room. Go to your room, Matias. How can I help? I'm Matias's mother. -Laura Brukman? -Yes. Mauricio Marzotta, from the insurance company. As I said downstairs, we have to ask Matias some questions. Matias has had a very bad time with all this and you already have his statement. So... please don't bother him any more about the insurance. Any questions you can ask me or my husband or our lawyer. The last thing I want is to bother you. It's just a formality really. But if you prefer, I'll find another way. Yes, I would prefer that. Now excuse me, I'm cooking... Madam... What do you think he wanted? I don't know. But don't talk to him. And wait a bit before you go out. They've done nothing to find the culprit. The police and the court have the resources yet they say they can't find any witnesses. But just by knocking on a few doors I've found someone who may be able to identify my son's killer. I want that man and his witness in here today. See to it. I'll bet that's the attorney. Hello? Good afternoon, sir. Yes, I'll put her on. Sir? How are you? Yes, I saw it. Why haven't you told them I was there? I don't know. What can I do? Nothing. What could you do? You haven't told anybody, -have you? -No. I said I hadn't. I keep thinking about the ice. Don't you? Without the ice, the mixer wouldn't have broken and we'd have stayed at the party. If we'd taken another street, nothing would've happened. See? Like a fool I think of all the possibilities. I know it's stupid but I can't think of anything else. You? How did you find it? The garage owner rang us when he saw the news. Yes, I can be there in half an hour, 45 minutes. Yes? Fine, goodbye. The public prosecutor. -Good morning. -Good morning. Do you recognise the car? I think it's the one that almost hit me. Are you sure? You need to be sure. Yes, this is the one. Good. - Get it checked in less than an hour. -Yes, madam. What do you think, chief? Can your people be a bit more professional for a change? Can I go to the toilet? Again? -I'm peeing myself. -Hold on a bit. -I really need to go, Mum. -Hold on. Why did you drink so much juice? Because. - You only just went. -I'll do it here! -After we've filled in these papers. - Over there. You two go and I'll wait here. Here. You go in. Next! -Hello. -Morning. Federico Samaniego? Yes, my wife and daughter have just gone to the toilet. Perez, take over. Follow me, please. We need to ask you some questions. -Trouble with our papers? -No, it's... It won't take a moment. This way. After you. -In there? - Yes. Is there some way I can let my wife know I'm here? She doesn't know. Mr Samaniego, by order of Judge Landivar, you're under arrest. What do you mean under arrest? This must be some kind of mistake. You don't need to put handcuffs on me. What's the charge? We've only been told to arrest you. My wife will be getting on the bus. Upon examination of your car, traces of paint were found from Pablo Marchetti's bicycle. You just admitted you ran over the bicycle but in circumstances for which there are neither proof nor witnesses. The next day you took your car to a garage and a few hours later left the country. Mr Samaniego, at the request of the public prosecutor's office I am obliged to evaluate your prosecution on the charge of manslaughter. However... This is all a mistake. Yes, I did hit the bicycle but I didn't touch the boy at all. However, I refuse the prosecutor's request to remand you in custody, so you are free to go. In the next ten days this court will decide what action to take and if the decision is taken to prosecute, your case will be referred to a tribunal. Thank you. Hello? There's a Mauricio Marzotta here at the office. He says he's from the insurance company. Take him to the board room. If he hasn't left after 10 minutes, interrupt us. - Good afternoon. -How are you, Mr Fustiniano? Please sit down. Sorry to turn up unannounced, but your wife said... Yes, yes. She said you'd been around. I want to be completely honest with you. We've been investigating you. You may not know but... a large number of customers pretend their cars have been stolen. Don't get me wrong... it's a financial investigation we've been doing. And we do so in every case of theft. -And you found nothing? -No, nothing. Your financial situation and your wife's are fine. Then the case is closed, -right? -I wish it was. But you will agree that your son's account of things is rather... unusual. No. I can't say that. Yes, Mr Fustiniano. The seat belt, the locks, the wooden, mechanical way he tells the story... So? Your son's hiding something from us. Isn't he? That's a very serious allegation. Have you any proof? Your car was covered against theft but not negligence. Yes. I understand your situation. I have kids too and I know how mixed-up kids are today. What with alcohol, night life and drugs... Imagine he got out of the car to say goodbye to a friend and left the key in, even the engine running. And someone passing by stole it. We wouldn't crucify him for that, would we? -No. -So, as I say... I'd just like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. But it isn't that simple because... My report may get passed on to other people... even a supervisor... but I really do think we can find a solution to this. It depends on how much you're ready to cooperate. What kind of cooperation? Look... I think we could work it out here and now for 20 per cent. "Did you say aliens?" "Yes, aliens. " "They took you to your grandparents'?" "No, not there. " -"But to a planet, Jupiter. " -Dad? What? Mum said they mixed you up with somebody else. -She told you? - Yes. Well... Let's go to sleep, shall we? Dad! Leave the door open tonight? Yes, sweetie, don't you worry. ...Pablo Marchetti's father, at the scene of the accident. Judge Landivar let my son's killer, Federico Samaniego, go free. Thanks to the judge we're all here and there's been no justice for my son. All we're asking for is an exemplary jaiI sentence so that no more people will die. Victor was clear and to the point... When are we eating, Mum? Soon. I'll call you. All right. I'll be in my room. What are we going to do? They arrested that man. But they let him go later. That's right. They accused him for lack of a suspect. To look like they're investigating. Nobody likes what's going on, Matias. But I'm sure it'll all come to nothing. Everyone will soon forget. -They said he'd been accused. -For how long? They've no proof, Chaucha. They've got nothing. -Maybe, but something... -What are you going to do? Me? Nothing. So... we just have to sit back and wait. Wait and see what happens. See you around. The case isn't overwhelming but with the pressure from the prosecutor, the media and the boy's family, Landivar will probably call you to trial. Which doesn't mean you've been found guilty. Once things have calmed down a little, we'll get the judge to take another look at the evidence. Can't we do anything to keep the boy's father quiet? Yesterday he called Fede -a murderer. -That's a delicate matter. The media are on his side and we should avoid confrontation with the family and indeed any kind of response. That'll be our strategy. We have to prove that there's no basis for the accusations. If we manage that, we have everything under control. What about the car that ran the kid over? Aren't the police looking for it? I suspect they're not. From experience, when they have "enough" evidence to request a trial, they don't look for another suspect. As there's no proof of any other car being involved, unfortunately we can't rely on anything like that. We need the judge to dismiss the evidence and for that we need to concentrate on their evidence. If we manage that, you'll be acquitted. So it's important you remember exactly what happened that night. Any fact could be relevant. The car braked where the line is. Right here? Yeah, here. Did you brake and get out and go to him...? What happened? No, no, no. I braked and got out. Then the kid started on at me because his bike was fucked. Right... Then what happened? I drove away. -Are you sure this was the man? -Yes. I'm sure. What were you doing at the time? I was in the kitchen giving the dog some water when I heard a screech of brakes. I went to the window and saw this man in a public telephone box below the house. He made a very short call, ran to his car and drove off. Could you recognize the make of the car? No... There was a tree in the way but I saw the lights. Check the phone records they sent us to see if that phone box was the one used to call the ambulance. Right. May I ask why you came in today? It didn't seem important that night. And I didn't connect it with the boy who'd been run over. But when I played it back in my mind, I realised it was the same man. My head's splitting. Take something for it. Have you heard anything else? All I saw was what was on the Internet. No, nothing much. He's still accused and they're looking into whether he was racing. What if they find the car? They won't. If they do, we'll have to go on saying it was stolen. Do you really think nothing'll happen to that guy? I don't know. He has a little girl. Did you see? When I think of Matias half-naked saying they'd stolen the car, I could kill him. I was watching TV with Lu before and the boy's father was on again. Lu had the remote control and saw it all. I didn't know what to do. I tried changing the subject, to get her away from the TV. I stood in front of it and in the end I grabbed the remote control off her. Then I burst into tears. I couldn't stand it. We'd better talk to Matias and take another look at things. Another look? The options we have. We have more than one? Haven't we? Or do we tell Matias he'll go to jail? No way! I'm not saying that but things are getting complicated. Exactly. The more difficult things are, the surer we have to be. We must show Matias a firm front. We're talking about prison! You say it like I'm telling you the only way out is to confess. What other options do we have? Go on like this, confess...? What else is there? Just a minute... Nine's okay. Yes, perfect. Bye. See you tomorrow. -So? -It was the lawyer. He said not to worry about the lady and the telephone box as the judge will probably dismiss it as evidence. And that we'll have to make an advance payment. I talked to my dad. He can lend us We need it, Fede. There's no other way so... You know what I think. How many shows have you had cancelled? Have you got any this month? My salary's hardly enough, Fede. You'll have to accept it. We'll find a way to pay it back later. Everything will be okay. I don't get it, I really don't. Here, sweetie. Everything will be okay. Will you stop saying that all the time, Fede! Things won't be any different tomorrow. -Okay, stop... -Like magic, everything's fine! Please, Fede! Let's not argue. It makes things worse. Come on. ARE YOU AT SCHOOL? I'M AT THE POND AT HOME SEND We have an acceptable body of evidence. Haven't we? Maybe. The best thing would be a direct witness or more forensic evidence. Yes. In an ideal world, but we haven't got that. We can only use what we've got. Let the tribunal sort it out. Write the indictment and send the papers for trial tomorrow. What have you brought? A notification and an arrest warrant. Leave the Samaniego file here. I'll write the indictment myself. All right. Tell me which tribunal it ends up with. Okay. SEVEN MONTHS LATER All rise. Please be seated. Having deliberated on the evidence given in this trial, this tribunal finds Federico Samaniego, case number 686, guilty of the circumstances judged in this case, considering him criminally responsible for the crime of involuntary manslaughter, and sentences him to 5 years' imprisonment with a special ban on driving for 10 years. He will also pay court costs. The recorder will make a copy for the register of sentences so that it may be certified and subsequently filed. This is an outrage. We'll appeal. This has been a truly historic day on which people feel that justice has truly been done. Pablo's father has repeated again and again.: "Now my son can rest in peace with his mother. " Back to you, Rodolfo, at the studio... Thank you, Javier. The strength of a father shattered by the loss of his son is moving. Let us hope that this sentence will serve to increase public awareness of traffic accidents and bring the death toll down And now... -He'll appeal and go free. -Right. They'll free him in the end, you'll see. I can't take any more. It's nearly over now. If you want to tell the police what happened, we'll be there to back you up. We won't leave you on your own. But you must give it serious thought. Is it what you want? I understand, Mati, but remember, he'll go free because he never did anything in the first place. Not us, though. We're talking about going to jail. Sit down. They really fucked you up. Five years was too much. If you keep your nose clean, you'll be out in three and a half. If you don't get out before. Going to appeal? Yes, the lawyer said we would. -What's his name? -Carlos Brauer. -What does he charge? -What? How much are you paying him? I don't know. My wife looks after all that. Your wife. Where did you work? -I was a comedian. -A comedian. With a dummy, yes. What's this? The guy on TV, right? Another celebrity? I hope he's not like the other. Remember? Poor guy. His name's Dummy. Dummy. Like it? I do. Dum-my. Know who I am? I'm Kempes to most. But not to you, okay? To you I'm... Puppeteer. THREE AND A HALF YEARS LATER Any ice cream left? Yes. I was thinking... one weekend we could go to the seaside. Somewhere with... trees and beaches. What do you say? Yes, I don't know... We can do whatever you like. The delta of the Tiger or... We don't need to do anything special. Okay. Malena. After we've finished why don't you show Dad how you fixed your room? Okay. Would you mind not smoking at the table? No problem. Thanks. This is delicious. Something different about it... Some spices I got in Chinatown. Don't you like it, Lu? I'm not hungry, I have to study. Stay at table till we've all finished. I have to study. We've almost finished. I'll bring dessert. -I don't want any. -Luciana... -Bugging her isn't going to work. -No... But she always ends up having her own way. How's work? Fine. Did you get it? Didn't I say I would? Ask for Quiroz at 23. Say I sent you. Try during the afternoon. -Fede? -Hold on a second. -Who are you talking to? -A friend. Coming to the supermarket with us? I can't. I'll wait here. Then you don't get to choose dessert. Kempes? I'm still here, Dummy. -You said Quiroz? -Yes. - And he knows what I need? -Sure. Says it has to be at least 50 a day. That's not too bad. Up to you. What about the other thing? Give me a few more days. Automobile stolen in 2006. What date? Here it is. Here. All the reports that day. You can look all you want and copy things but you can't print. Kempes is a friend but there's a limit. Hello? Hello? Hello? Biscione? -Andres Biscione? -Yes? Know who I am? Take a good look. Remember me? No. I haven't changed that much in 4 years. Sure you don't remember me? From the club? Yes, from the club. The Sports Club. What was your name? Must go. Nice to see you. Carry on there and leave this to the end. Why didn't they use props? It's against a wall. We'll start there and then go on. But... it says here to leave it to the end. It's supported by two pillars, it'll be okay. It'll hold. -I may be back tomorrow. - Okay. They're not wearing helmets. Felipe! Hello? It's Kempes, dummy. It's open. Go to your room for a while. -I'm chatting with Coti. -Do as I say. Why do I have to go? Please go to your room! Hi, Dummy. How are you? - Okay? -Fine. Nice place. We could go to the bar... No, I'm in a bit of a rush. I'll have some mate, though. Did you see Sergeant Quiroz? Yes. Thanks. -Have you done it yet? -With some, I have. And? Nothing yet. But I've only just begun. Right... patience. I've got what you wanted. I had to call in somewhere nearby so I picked it up. Good service, huh, Dummy? It's clean. Know how to use it? Flip open the chamber... Then close it. And that's it. No need to... cock it like they do in the films. I'll ring one of these days. That's how it works. You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours... Hi. -Hello. -Hello. Mariela Fraga? -Yes. Did the architect send you? -No, no. Do I know you? -Do you? -A customer? -Who was that? -Some lunatic. What? Nothing. Andrea rang not long ago. Malena's with Coti. She's sleeping over. She said to ring her brother again. He should be able to get you a job. Don't worry, I'm looking after that. Come here. Breathe close to me. Hi. Hi. Are you at the studio? No, in the street. I'm between patients... I've got your pills. They were about to run out. How did you know? The rep always comes at the end of the month. -Coming home for supper? -Yes, I suppose so. Okay, love you. Bye. Give him next week. How many are there? I'll look. Next one's Federico Sanchez. First time and private. -Fine. Send him in. -Right. Go in, please. Sit down. There are five more, doctor. This gentleman has tooth decay. No, I don't know if it is. Then let's take a look. Just here. Open your mouth. Does that hurt? There? No, I can't see anything wrong. If it's bothering you, it must be the gum. You'll need to use mouthwash and dental floss. So it's nothing then? No, nothing. -Sure? -Yes. It doesn't feel like anything in the gum. We can do an X-ray if it'll put your mind at rest. No, that's not necessary. Mouthwash then. And dental floss. Don't forget. Good hygiene is very important. Nice photos. You've got two kids? I've got a girl. How old are they? They're your kids, right? Yes. It's been much easier than I expected. Pardon? The tooth decay. It was just my imagination. Wasn't it? We must call the police, Ricardo. What do you mean? What would we say? That there's a guy looking for us? No, I need to call Carmona and he can tell us what to do if the guy goes to the police. -He won't go to the police. -How do you know? Because he hasn't got any evidence. And why would he go? He's after something else. That's right. Why else did he come to the clinic? What if he followed me back here? We must go, Ricardo. I don't know. I don't know... -We'll go to a hotel. -A hotel? What do you want me to say? I'll ask Carmona to give us some protection... I don't know. We'll go to my sister's house at the country club. The country club? What for? He's already found us once. What difference does that or a hotel make? Why don't you fucking listen to me! We can't go and hide in the country club, it's ridiculous! I'm not saying we're going to live at the country club. Just stay a fewdays. I need to think what to do. I don't know what that guy wants. Calm down, dammit! -Did you ring? -I'm going to now! Carmona, this is Ricardo Fustiniano. Call me urgently please. Hello, Graciela. Look, I need a favour. It's urgent. Hi. Just get in? I expected you later. Pour me a drop of wine? I'm exhausted. That's too much. Everything okay? Yes. Fede? -What did your sister say? -She's sending the keys by taxi. Carmona? This is Ricardo. Still trying. Please call when you hear this. -The kids? -I'll see if Lu's okay. I'll carry on here. I'll explain, Lu, I promise but there's no time now. Matias, help your father. Stop treating me like I'm stupid. What's going on? -Luciana, please! -Why the country club? Don't answer that! It's the taxi with the keys. Grab all the cash you can. I'm not going anywhere if you don't tell me why. Stop it, girl! Stop it! -No, I won't...! -Luciana, go and get your things! Go and get your things! That's enough! I'll wait in the car. Keep the change. Get in. Move! Let's go. Give it to me. DAD Take the first to the right. What are you going to do to me? -He's not answering. -What's wrong? -What...? -Answering service. -Mum, what is it? -Shut up! For fuck's sake! What's going on? Call the police. Now, Ricardo! -Please don't hurt me. -Don't even breathe. Get out. Get out. Say you're a friend of Pablo's and want to talk. Who is it? I'm... a friend of Pablo's... I wanted to tell you something. Help him up. Get off! What the fuck are you doing here? You wretch! Out or I'll kill you. Matias Fustiniano. That's this bastard's name. Matias Fustiniano. He's the one. Him. The bastard who killed your son. He was driving the car that killed Pablo. Then he got rid of it. He told the police it had been stolen and then walked away. They fucked up my life. You fucked up my life. He fucked up my life. And this bastard... nobody did a thing to him. Not you... the police... or anybody. When I grabbed him just now he was running away. Again. If he doesn't talk, there's no evidence. NO RETURN
