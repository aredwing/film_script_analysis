You get the fuck up... before you ruin that nice dress even more. Think you can make a fool out of me... stealfrom me and just walk away? You lucky you got a nice piece of ass. Otherwise... I don't even want to think about it. You going to marry that little fucker Sam... and you going to cook and clean... and you going to suck his cock every once in a while. Do you want to know why? 'Cause that's the worst thing I can think to do to you. Now fix yourself up pretty because people are waiting. You want to fight me? Go fuck... I changed my mind. Bill... Stay right here. Be right back. Yo, Red. Red, how you doing? Yeah, what? Shake hands. Go get a job, man. Got one? Come on. That was good. I like that. - Hey, guys. - Hi, Ruby. My favorite cop. Yeah, what? I took care of that little problem for you. You might want to go away for a couple of days... go fishing or something. All right. - How'd we do this week? - Good, boss. I don't know. It looks like it could've been better. Good... Business is good. Every day is payday. That's a nice tux, Sam. What's this? The American dream, huh? Yeah. Why not? Hey, why not? Get going, buddy. Well... There she is... Your Christmas bonus... a few months early. You're a beautiful girl, Freddie. Ifeel bad the way you turned up in this bad crowd situation. It's a shame. If ever you want a way out, just... give me a call. You know? Maybe I can help. Fuck you. God. She's beautiful. She was beautiful yesterday. Yeah, but today, she's mine. What are youfucking looking at? Let me ask you something, Lloyd. Why are you such a fucking wick, huh? All passengers should be onboard. I wonder if your brother is going to show up. Jjaks. Who invited him? I told him it wasn't right... if he didn't come to his brother's wedding. But, please, if he comes, try and get along with him. Sam, I'm talking to you. What if she doesn't come, Mom? Will you stop eating? I didn't take your money. I told you that! You embarrass me, little girl. Sir, sit down right here. Come on, Freddie, make it easy on yourself. Come on, get in the spirit. Straighten up. Hope you two kids will be very happy. Dearly beloved... we are gathered here in the sight of God... to witness and bless... Hi, Mom. the joining together of Sam and Freddie... Jjaks, you came. How nice. What's the story? They make a nice couple, don't they? No, they don't. Behave yourself, Jjaks. But that is the portion in this life... What did you get them? Whisper it to me. When it is God's will... Come on. Nothing, Mom. I didn't get them nothing. Knowledge and love of the Lord... Therefore, marriage is not to be entered into... unadvisedly or lightly. You showed up empty-handed. And in accordance... What is the matter with you, Jjaks? Into the holy union... Sam and Freddie now come to be joined. Here we go. I love this. When somebody loves you It's no good unless he loves you All the way Happy to be near you When you need someone to cheer you All the way Can I get a beer? I just want to get the fuck out of here. Thanks. Who are you? Jjaks. Jack? No, Jjaks. Jjaks? - Jjaks what? - Clayton. You're not related to him, are you? Sam's my brother. I don't know who's worse off, you or me. Me. Are you shy? No. He ain't heavy. He's my shithead brother. You didn't have to get all dressed up, you know? What were you in for this time, huh? My brother likes to spend his free time in prison... isn't that right, Jjaks? Whenever I can get away. This is my new wife Freddie. Come on. Chicken. Come on. Scissors beats paper. Come on. Paper beats rock. OK? Come on. Shit! Rock beats scissors. God! Fuck! She's a knockout, isn't she? So you won the game, I won the girl. I can't believe you even showed up. Especially without a present. Nice tux, Sam. I'm going to go pee. They Asked me how I knew My true love was true A little to the left. A little to the right. Bull's-eye! Did you come for me? I don't even know you. No! Did you come for me? Did you? You got to shave, baby. You're ruining my skin. Jesus. I look like shit. Don't I look like shit? Yeah, I do. I'm getting old. You're not even, what, twenty-five? I'm closer to thirty than to twenty. I used to be seven years old. I used to be unborn. I used to be fourteen. And tomorrow I'll be forty orfifty. So? I'm dying. I'm dying. You're dying. Right now, we're both dying. Listen to the ticking. It gets louder with every second. I don't want to die here. You should just split. Really? You think those guys are just gonna let me walk away? They haven't yet. See? They did this to me. - Jesus. - Yeah, Jesus. Red says that I owe him ten grand. He says that I stole it from him. It's bullshit. He found it on the books. Your damn brother did. So, there it is. I'm his reward. He's my punishment. Fuck them anyways. Fuck them anyways. See you out back? You see a pair of laughing eyes And suddenly you're sighing sighs You're thinking nothing's wrong You string along, boy, then snap Those eyes, those sighs They're part of the tender trap It'll always turn to shit. Not only don't you bring a gift... you don't even say good-bye. Those dreams that dream They're part of the tender trap Some starry night When her kisses make you tingle She'll hold you tight And you'll hate yourself for bein'... Empty the cash. Come on, come on! Move it, move it, move it! Jjaks? Jjaks, is that you? Damn it. Just give me the money. You wouldn't shoot me, would you? I'm not gonna shoot you. Sorry, Bob. In my life There's been heartache and pain I don't know if I can face it again Can't stop now I've traveled so far It's a candy dish. Congratulations on your marriage. Good-bye. Don't leave me. I'm sorry. Mommy! - Oh, my God. - Is she all right? You... You killed her. You show up to my wedding after no one invites you. Mom invited me. Get her all upset... so she faints and dies just like that. Maybe it was you who upset her. Me? Not me. I was herfavorite! She didn't send me off packing when I was eight! Stupid. Hey, Freddie. Sorry. So how is married life treating you? That good, huh? Hey, can I bum one of those? Thanks. Sorry about your mother, boys. Mine died about six years ago. Worstfuckin' day of my life. I need a word with you, Jjaks. Why? Huh? What did he do this time? Christ! What did you do thatfor? Tell me about the gas station you knocked off. I got a captain crawling up my ass for an answer... so I'm gonna take a little refuge up yours. Now that old guy, Bob... he didn't see you, but he heard you, right? It's always something when you show up. It's notfinished between me and you, Jjaks. Just want you to know that. I can't sleep. It's cold in here. Want another blanket? Did you stay for me? I stayed to bury my mother. Tomorrow? I'm taking off. I know you've been thinking about me. 'Cause I've been thinking about you. And when I do... I can feel you inside me. You want to be inside me again, Jjaks? We shouldn't. Again. I thought I told you to shave. Sorry. Have you ever been to Vegas, Jjaks? It's the best. I went there when I was little with my mom. We met Ann-Margret. Man, she was the coolest. I mean, she was like... Like a kitten with balls, you know what I mean? She gave me this. She signed her picture and gave me this. It's supposed to bring me luck. Let's just go. Let's just start this thing up and get out of here. I can't. Why? Why can't you see? Maybe all this shit happened with me, with you... with your mom dying... Maybe it happened so we'd end up together. I can't. If you leave me here with these bastards... I swear you're a biggerfucker than they are. Don't you see? Itfeels too good. It's gonna turn to shit! I just can't! Come on. I can make you happy. - Don't touch me. - I can't sleep. I'm not in the mood. Get off of me. For Christ sakes, Freddie. You're my wife. - I want to make love. - I don't want it! - Let me... - No, it hurts. Don't push me away. Please. Sam, stop. It hurts like that. Come on. Get off me! But itfeels good like that. It's great out here. Waitfor me. Come on. Right over there. What are you doing back here? I got a car waiting outside. For me? You came back for me? Where are we going? What are you doing? I'll be back in a minute. Do you believe in love atfirst sight? Me neither. It came with the car. They're gonna be lookingfor me, you know. I know. How young are you? How old am I? Let's count the rings Around my eyes How smart are you? How dumb am I? Don't count any Of my advice Meet me - Anyplace - Anywhere Or anytime Now, I don't care Meet me tonight Let me speak to Red orJoseph. Look, I don't care what time it is. OK, I'm sorry. Just give me the... I gotta turn my life around. I gotta do things different. So is this doing things differently... running off with someone else's wife? You can't look at it like that. I mean, look at it like this... Time is like... an orange. It's round. It means that everything repeats itself. And everything that happens happens for a reason. Lieutenant Ben Something. Some... Costikyan! Yes! Yes, just leave a message. No, I don't need to speak to anybody! Just leave a message, OK? Thanks. The big promise I made myself... was that I'd never spend another day in prison. Not one. You want to know the truth? You want to avoid prison? Quit sticking up gas stations. What I'm talking about is different. I'm just saying go home one last time and get the money. We have a little cash. I gotfifty bucks stuffed in my underwear... and you've got enough to springfor this swell place? We left in a hurry, Jjaks. We forgot. - I know, but... - Come on. We're almost there. Almost. It's like, if I close my eyes... I can see us in Vegas... lying by a pool... with water in it. It's always sunny and warm. And guys in white jackets bring us daiquiris... and all the food we can eat forfour bucks. And all the towels smell like Downy fabric softener. There's no clocks, no bedtime... and when I get going there... you can come see me perform at night. I'd be wearing big redfeathers... one of those things on my head... like crown things, with diamonds in it. When I come offstage I'd be too wired to sleep... so we'll make love until morning... sleep until 2:00. It's half my money, Jjaks, right? I'm his wife, right? It's the law. He kept saying that he was gonna make me happy... that he had all this money stashed away. So after everything... let him make me happy, Jjaks. I just don't know where he hides it. What? You know where, don't you? Do you? Look at me. You told me to call, Ben. Nothing. He's back. Alone. I spend my whole life trying not to come back here. I always end up coming back here. Where's Freddie? Why don't I just put the money back... and really never come back? So you and my wife can live happily ever after? That sounds like a really good dealfor me. We're gonna go at it, aren't we, Sam? Big time. Shit! Bastard. Shit. You bastard! You piece of shit! Take a little refuge up yours. Jeez. You need a doctor? I need a tank of gas. Justfill it up. Where's your can? Hello. I just saw a cop get beat up. Ben... Ben Costi-hoo! Costikyan. Yes, I did. Jjaks Clayton. I don't know. He just beat the hell out of him. He might be dead. Yes. One-eighty-two Goodrich. That's right. I don't... Stop! That's my horse! Clementine! Hi, honey. I'm home. What happened? - I got him good. - You need a doctor. No. I hate doctors. I always throw up around doctors. Shit. I can't believe this. Look. This is what he did. Christ. I hung on to the sucker, though. My God, that is disgusting. I don'tfeel good. Let me help you, OK? I need to lie down. Yeah, you should lie down. You sure you know what you're doing? Be quiet. You know how to operate this? Look at that. Isn't that your horse? I didn't mean for this to happen, Jjaks. I'm so sorry. I'm afraid to ask. What? Did you get the money? You think this is the best time to discuss finances? It's my last chance, Jjaks. Yeah. I got it. That's what Ifound. He's got more than this. He said so. - I don't understand. - It's enough. We can check out of here and go... in the morning. What are we gonna do? This was our last chance! They're gonna find us andfucking kill us! How could you let him get to you? I didn't let him get to me. Let go of me! I counted on you, Jjaks! - Hey, shut up in there! - You shut up! You shut the fuck up! Is everything all right in there? What's going on? Where are the car keys? I'm gonna call the cops! I'll get you some help. Show's over, so crawl back into yourfucking hole. All right. Hi, Freddie. - Where's Red and Joseph? - It's just me. Let's go for a drive. Come on. Come on, I want to talk. Come on, drive. You don't need that gun. You gotta be reasonable about this. This wasn't meant to be. You know? I'm sure there's lots of girls... I guess, who... would be just rightfor you. Let's talk about it. It was supposed to be a surprise... but I can tell you now. I sent half the money already. Not a down payment, but half of it. You would... You'd laugh if you knew how hard it was to get this money. Red'd shit his pants. Look. This is the model right here. It's nice. It's 2,700 square feet. Central air and heat. It's got cable with fifty-seven channels... a two-car garage... and look, a swimming pool with tennis courts... and a park, you know, that they're building. I can't breathe. Don't open the fucking door! Look, I know that your dream is to live in Vegas... but this is close to Vegas, but better. It's like a real neighborhood. We have a choice. Look what it says here. "Eggplant or ecru" for the carpeting. Is that a color? I don't know. I guess. Eggplant. And how many children should we have? Two. You're a liar. Can I get a Coke... and a Hostess cupcake? Sure. One of those sweatshirts, too. Here. What are youfamous for? I don't know. That was a nice horse you had. What? You know. Yeah, thanks. So, did you call the cops? No. Why? Did you? No. It wasn't my horse. Shoot. Could I use your phone? I'm sorry. We can't tie it up. Tie it up? - Who's gonna call? - Sorry. There's trouble in there. A murder! I saw the guy. My name? Shit. Jesus. Oh, shit. This is the manager of the motel. The police are here. They want to have a look around your room. Whatever you got going in there, get rid of it. I ain't in the mood to have the place busted. So, what's going on? Well, let's find out. I just spoke to him. I'm sorry. I was in the bathroom... and my wife is sleeping. Please, let's whisper. She's come down with some sort of flu. Poor thing was throwing up all night. She justfell asleep maybe ten minutes ago. What happened to you? My stupid brother and me. We got drunk. It was stupid. - What's this? - What? There's blood here on the sink. From my head. He got me pretty good. But I got him better. Where is your brother? Kicked his ass back home. I came to visit, right? He gets drunk and all bent out of shape. Who needs that, right? Where is home? About half an hour outside of St. Paul. Let's go. Why don't you come on outside? Come on out here for a second. Just need to talk to you. You ever been in any trouble? Not really. Maybe a little. You got a record? Figured as much. You staying out of trouble? Yes, sir. I've got my life and my wife. That's all a man needs to turn things around. Yeah, well... I'm sorry, Freddie. And? What... I got an emergency call, come on! Life is one big emergency, man, so fuck off. Some asshole. I don't know. Am I given to understand you killed Freddie Clayton? Is that true? Is that a yes or a no? It doesn't matter because your brother here... says he knows where you stashed the body. And if that's true, that's a very sad thing... because that was a beautiful girl... with her whole life ahead of her! Son of a bitch. I liked that girl. Kind of a stupidfucking name is that, anyway? What? It was supposed to be Jack... but they fucked up his birth certificate. No, yeah! A stupidfucking typo. That's all your life amounts to, huh? It's here somewhere. Where? He must've did something with it. Sure you got the right spot? Well, there's nothing here. Don't point out the obvious. It's fucking annoying. No, he moved her. You did something. Where is she? Come on! Hey, hey! Jesus! You think I've got the time to fool around? You remember I'm a cop! People depend on me. I'm here to serve and protect. I don't have the time to fuck around... with a couple of fucking losers like you! But I saw it! How do you know she's here? Maybe it's up the road or something. This is it. This is the spot. I'm telling you what I saw! I don't think so. Youfind your own way back. You can't just leave me out here. I can't, huh? Gimme a light, asshole. So what went wrong? She make you mad? Come on, you can tell me. What did you do with her body? You know I know. People know she didn't want to be with you. And people know you let those motherfuckers... write that on her arm, you bastard! - I didn't tell 'em to do it! - Who did? She was my wife! Forfourfucking days! So? Wasn't conventional. We didn't meet at the prom. So what? So why couldn't she love me anyway? You know I didn't have any reason to kill her... but you did! I can't remember anything, but you were there, right? Maybe. Where's the body? Kiss my ass. Hey, you set me up. Only if you're setting me up. So, was it love or just... with Freddie? Fuck off. A good blow job feels like love every time, right? Shit! I'm not letting you out of my sight. Notfor a minute. That's fine with me. Where you going? Don't answer it. Who is it? Tell my brother what you just told me. Who is it? Just take the phone. That's right, Mr. Clayton. What my wife saw the other night made me sick. One of you carrying that woman... her body... into the room... and then the other one carrying her out. I think you know what I mean. Fifty thousand dollars ought to do it. I don't want to be hard, 'cause you got problems... but I'd really like the money by morning... or I'll have to go to the police. Sorry for the inconvenience. Did you hear what he said? He said... one of us carried her body into the room... and one of us carried her out. I only carried her out. I mean, I couldn't remember. You bastard! You let me think it was me! Look, it doesn't matter who killed her, right? I mean, he saw me and he saw you... It matters! I loved her! Well, don't worry now. You did the right thing calling me. I'll take care of everything, OK? But you gotta take care of me, too. Listen to me, asshole, this is what's gonna happen. You buried me in this shit, and you're gonna dig me out. You're gonna give me the money. - What money? - To pay that motel guy off. There is no money. You lying sack of shit! I don't have it anymore! It's gone! I bought a house! Half a house. Near Vegas for Freddie and me. We're supposed to have a house. A house? You bought a house? Get up! What are we going to do with a fucking house? You're gonna get that money! Wait! Wait! I got it. I got it. This is what we do. We go to where you hid her body... and we dispose of it once andfor all... where nobody can find it in a thousand years. Then we don't have to pay nobody nothing. See? You idiot! What? I never moved her body. How could you lie to me about that? You ate my ear... you killed your wife, youframed me... and you're mad at me for lying? Jesus, what kind of sicko would take a dead body? My head... You really hurt my head. Shut up. Better pray I calm this motel guy down while... I go to Red's and ask him for the money. Ask him? Beg him. Bear his fucking children if you have to. You better take this. I don't need it. I don't want any more problems. We're talking about serious stuff here. You might need it just to reason with the guy. You don't have to shoot him unless you absolutely have to. Good luck. Fuck off. Always burning the midnight oil, as they say. Jesus Christ. This is unbelievable. I was just about to come to see you. Here you are. I should come back later. You're busy. No, I'm finished. This adding and subtracting shit you do is hard. It's very hard. I don't pay you enough. Yeah, well... What did you want to see me about? It can wait. Naw, it can't. Well... I'm in kind of a fix, you know? I was gonna see about borrowing... some money, maybe. You want more money? You think you can fuck with my books... and I won'tfind out? Who the fuck are you? I didn't take nothin', I swear! OK, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I want it all back. I'm gonna break yourfucking legs anyway... but you are going to give me back every dime... and every seed of every joint you ever smoked of mine... that didn't belong to you! I don't have it anymore. He took the money. My brother... I don't give a shit! You took itfirst! He stole itfrom you, you steal it back. I got no beef with your brother. Thirty-eight grand you owe me. That's what Ifigure's gone over the past year... give or take a penny or a pill. I mean it. If I had it, I'd give it to you. No! That prick... Are you listening to me? I don't care about yourfucking problems! I look like a fucking shrink? You tell it to that cunt Ann Landers. You do what you gotta do. Sell your mama's blood for nickels. I don't give a fuck. My mama's dead. Right. Well, I guess you shit outta luck. Just let me go. OK? I'm sorry. Hey, don't move! Red, don't move. Youfucking shit! All right... Damn, Red! Drop the gun. You drop yours. I pulled mine outfirst. Then, Sam, you're fired. Aw, shit! Aw, shit! Shit. Shit. It's forty-six thousand, youfucking idiot. You can't count, you bastard. You got here fast. You said by morning. That's right. I guess I did. Would you like a cup of tea? A sandwich? So, where's your brother, parking the car? Relax. He's getting the money. He'll be along. He'll be along? - Yeah. - When? Look, I just... I don't want no trouble. Just relax, OK? OK, I'll relax. You relax, too. What's the matter? Where you going? Look, maybe this wasn't such a good idea. What the fuck is going on here? Stop it! Stop it! You took her body, you sick son of a bitch, didn't you? You sick fucker, you! Where is she? She put us up to it! That girl... Shut up! I'm really tired of the motel business. There's no future in it, you know? Inside. We had our eye on this really nice RV. It's OK, baby. Don't worry. I know it was Sam who killed me. Fuck! Oh, shit. It's OK. I don't... I don't get it. Someone found me at the side of the road. Jesus. Saved my life. But I saw... I mean, I saw. Oh, my God, you're bleeding. She's bleeding! Help! I'm OK. I'm OK. Sam's a lousy shot. Even that close. The bullet went in there and out there. Doctor says I was lucky. I told him there's no such thing as luck. It's real, right? It must be. I mean, I've neverfelt like... Whatever that word is. Happy. I need you to tell me exactly what happened. I don't know exactly. I blacked out. I couldn't remember anything and... there you were. I thought I'd killed you. - Why would you want to kill me? - I wouldn't. - What did I ever do to you? - Nothing. Just thinking about you in that ravine... bleeding to death... You broke my heart, Jjaks. I was scared. I was stupid. I was fucked up. Please forgive me. Baby... I've already forgiven you. - Where are you going? - I'm hungry. I've got a fucking hole in my stomach. You want something to eat? I'll bring us back something. You wait here. Oh, shit. Damn. Here you go. Can I ask you something? You want me to throw that outfor you? What? No. Are you OK? Can I ask you something? Go ahead. Shoot. If you had, you know, killed two people... murdered them... and in the process had gotten almost a hundred grand... That's close to ninety-eight thousand dollars... which nobody was going to miss, you hope... and a stranger was blackmailing you... would you give him a big chunk of that money... you worked so hard to get? You are weird. No, I wouldn't give the bastard a red cent. Yeah? That's what I think, too. Could you... bring me... one of those doughnuts, too? Yeah, hold on. Since I'm a regular, think I could use your phone? Yeah, but... don't make a habit of it, OK? The Suburban motel. Twenty-one ninety-five. That includes a color TV. How can I help you? Put him on. - Yeah? - It's me. It's about time. Did you get the money? I got the money. Good. OK, so come on. You should have seen me. I was great. So we'll see you soon, right? He had no choice when I put it the way I put it. I made him see it my way. And, Sam, bring the key. What key? On top of everything, he says I owe him 30 bucks... for the motel key I took. It's in the fish dish. The fish dish. Look on top of the TV. But I'm not at home. Where are you? I'll get you another cup. See ya. - Shit. - What? Stupid machine forgot to put sugar in my coffee. This is weird. You scream like you just saw a ghost. I'm the one who just saw a ghost. You are a ghost, aren't you? I know 'cause I killed you. I was there. Youfucker, you. What are you gonna do, kill us all? Come on, what's in the bag? Is that money? We can all get out of here. Oh, boy. You know... how does something like this happen to me? All along it never occurred to me... that the only reason that your body was missing... is because you weren't dead. I gotta keep my head here. I gotta do something right! You know, Jjaks... why can't it be nice when you come home to visit? Normal, like otherfamilies? Leave him alone! Stop! No! No more, please! It's all right. I'm a police officer. Drop the gun, Jjaks. Come here, Freddie. I'm sorry. Come on. You drop that gun, Jjaks. Folks, you mind stepping outside, please? This is officially a crime scene. Oh, my God. I don't think I can go through with this. You called me, remember? There's no turning back now. It's done. Don't worry. It'll be nice. You tried to bury me, Jjaks. Fuckin'- A. And, Jjaks... if you're gonna kill someone... you gotta kill 'em. I could really get in a lot of trouble for this. I'm not supposed to let you in without Mr. Cos... Custodian. Well... I won't tell if you don't tell. Thanks. What is your name again? Listen, Lloyd, I am trying to help you. I was there. I saw everything. Jjaks did not kill his brother. Listen, I gotta go. He's gonna be OK, right? Leave me alone! I don't know where... You promise? What are you gonna do? I'll look into it. How? All my money is fucking gone! Oh, oh, jeez. There's nothing wrong with my wife, is there? Your wife's fine, Ben. She's a little pissed at you. We got a callfrom Freddie. Freddie who? And she had some very interesting things to say. She stole all my fucking money. Ask this guy. Hey, tell him. Tell this fucker, who works for me... that she stole every lastfucking cent. Tell him, for Christ's sake! Come on, hey! Look, hey, Lloyd, OK, we're cops. We gotta stick together. That's what we do. If we don't look out for each other, who will, man? Let me ask you something, Ben. Why you such a fucking wick, huh? Hey, I got pants up there! Hey, listen! I suppose it's none of my business... but after all that... you sure this is the right woman for you? I don't know. Maybe. How do you know for sure she's even here? She's here. Thanks for the ride. Appreciate it. Take one of these with you. I don't have twenty-five bucks for a Bible. - It's a gift. - Keep it. You got a family to feed. Don't look so worried. Look at this. I got a letterfrom her not too long ago. "DearJjaks, maybe it's all bullshit. "Maybe nothing does happen for a reason after all... "but I'm doing great. "I'm living my dream. "So fuck you anyways. Freddie. " I hate to say this, son... but that don't sound exactly like a love letter. You gotta read between the lines. Good luck. Good night, Freddie. What took you so fucking long?
