We'll always be one of the best in Finland. At least we think so. Flight, guys? - That's right. We're number one. Let's hope we stay at the top of the charts. Pertti, we havent even recorded anything yet! Toni, time to go onstage. Flush the toilet and wash your hands. I've been to the toilet and... - Without washing hands. Now Pertti Kurikka's Name Day will play! Alright. Let's go. My shirt says "God dammit!" You don't listen to me. You don't understand me. That's where my competition starts. Some pretty kick-ass bands will play here tonight, such as... Pertti Kurikka's Name Day! Give it up for Pertti Kurikka's Name Day! This is great! I need a little respect and equality in my life I need a little respect and dignity in my life Goddammit! Pertti, just one chorus. - I'm trying my best. I'll shout "intro" after the chorus, so you'll know. Let's just move on. I need a little respect and equality in my life I need a little respect and dignity in my life No. Too late. - Look at my fingers. You see one or five? There's just one chorus. One! Not five. - I'm sorry I think I've had enough. That's enough. - A break. Why can't I get it? Pertti, you'll get it. I'll count to four. You'll get the hang of it. - I get it. Don't cry, big boy. - I'm not crying. This isn't about crying. This is about punk. This is about honor and rock 'n' roll. I didn't cry Pertti, when you write riffs for songs,... don't write such difficult ones. Don't write such difficult ones. Write easy ones. - I try my best. It's Friday March 11th. Writing a diary is very important to me because... I can release my a-a-anger... into my diary. It helps me if I have... a b-b-b-bad day I'll write in my diary that Pertti is a shithead... and that Pertti is an asshole... and that Pertti is a faggot and a shit goddamn asshole. Pertti will be stabbed. Pertti will be punched in the face. Pertti Will be... strangled to d-d-d-death. That's why I write these things. Hi! How's it going? Have a friggin' good time! Wave your hands in the air like you don't give a fuck! Now we'll kick some ass! One, two, one, two, three, four. Sorry, sorry... Sorry for this little...

Darling, you'll get some when they leave. Darling, you'll get some when they leave. Love is, in a nutshell,... cool, awesome,... fantastic and incredible. Women are lovely stunning and wonderful... when they're in a good mood. When they're in a bad mood,... you can't talk to them or do anything with them. That's what I've learned over the years... in the brief relationships... I've had with women in my life. I lived... lived in the Riihenkulma Orphanage. As a child, I examined... the seams of the staff's... staff's clothing. That's how.. that's how this seam thing started. That's how.. That's how it started. Pertti, please read the lyrics for us. They're Kari's lyrics. - No, they're from your diary Right. They give me pig food in the nuthouse I keep my mouth shut; Otherwise I'll be stabbed Speech defect! Speech defect!

I just want to make sure we have everything. So we don't have to come back. Did you take a shower today, Pertti? I smell shit. It's not me. - But I can smell it. You're wearing clean underwear? - I haven't shit myself. Kalle, c'mon. You can't go onstage with shit in your pants. - I'll shower later. That'll be too late. - I'll take a shower tonight. Can you take a shower now? - Not now. You still have time. - I won't do it now Yes, you will. - The hell with you. Dammit! The man stinks! Where are we going to find you underpants? I'll get you a bag for the dirty ones. Promise me you'll change your underpants every day. I promise. - I don't want to keep saying the same thing over again. Are you angry with me? - No. You can't be angry with me. Go like that. Throw a leather jacket on and get onstage. ADHD ADHD I'm nervous about how it'll go. Everything will go just fine.

Happy birthday Thank you. Please come in. We sure will. I'm sad that Sami Helle couldn't come... to my birthday party. I don't like this. He just flakes out. - Sami has his reasons. Yeah, I know. - That's the reason. Next summer... you, Toni and Aira can come to my balcony Sit on the balcony? - Yes. Kalle, you can bring your wife. - Alright. You're having a baby? - In the summer we will. Due in April. - Great! Thais the spirit. I knew it! Kalle, I know how babies are born. Please tell us. Babies are born when a man does this. His sperm goes in here,... into the wife's... Inside her. Then she gives birth to a small child. When the wife has given birth,... the baby comes out carefully If the child is healthy... everyone congratulates the parents. Congratulations, Kalle. And to your wife, too. A lovely child has come into the world. Would you like a glass? - Thank you. The Centre Party of Finland aims at giving every Finn... a chance for a better future. We have to give our children and young people a chance. Their future is at stake and I believe... Their future is at stake and I believe... everyone has the right to be safe at school,... receive health care, work and study With these thoughts, dear friends,... I wish you all luck in the election. Thank you for coming here today. This is Sami. - I-Ii, Mari. Nice to meet you. I've been following you guys. You mean our band? I knew it! You're celebrities. - Yeah, I guess you could say that. He signed up... I signed up to volunteer for your election campaign. - That's great. I have to help you; You're the chairwoman, after all. I'm glad to hear that. Thank you. I want to see you continue in the government. - That's the way We have a gig at Semifinal. Are you coming? - No, I'm leaving for Brussels tomorrow. Okay, see you around. - See you. This is awesome. Could I reschedule my pedicure... so that I have time to eat dinner, buy groceries," clean my room, listen to music... and watch TV because today I have... Kari, you have something every night. You see, I have... I was planning to have a quiet night at home. I don't want Sami to come everywhere with me. It pisses me 011. I'm not going back to the group home. Fuck! No fucking way! One day I'll blow up the group home. Don't. it's my home, too. Don't take your problems out on us. It's between you and the supervisors. They force me to go everywhere with you. I can't do anything about it, so shut up. I can't do anything about it. Talk to the supervisors. Don't take it out on me. Why do they do that? - Don't ask me. Why doesn't anybody understand that they always force me To hang out with these bastards and go for a pedicure Fuckin' pedicurists They all suck big time They just take care of your feet They don't understand Why the hell do pedicurists exist? That's something I never figured out They force me They force me They always force me It sucks that they force me to get a pedicure I don't understand I don't understand I don't understand I don't understand Kalle, I can't stand him looking at me so angrily. I can't play. - Kari, don't look at Sami. Yeah. He keeps glaring at me. Pedicurist rist, pedicurist, pedicurist... Fuck! if that's what Kari wants. Play the gigs first. - I won't play with him on Saturday. I'll stay home. That's a fact. I will. This isn't nice. You can start looking for a new bassist... if that's what Kari wants. Let's go for coffee. - I'm not going if he's coming. You don't have to sit with him. - I still won't. I don't want to look at him. Thanks for ruining my day you shithead. Fuckin' clown. Fuckin' clown. Hi, Sami! - Bye. Fuck! Shit! Shit fuck! Shit fuck! Fucking hell! Fucking asshole! Shit. HELSINKI SCHOOL OF PEDICURE You made it. Kari, please hang your clothes here. Please take your shoes 011. Be careful with the edge. - Sure. Many people have very sensitive feet. - Not me. I like this. That's good. I flew into a rage today at work. I flew into a rage today at work. I yelled at the top of my lungs and almost threw a rock. But you managed to control yourself. Tell me if you don't feel well. - No, I'm fine. This is the life of a rock star. Pertti always grabs people's sleeves and... pretends he's a snake. He's the guitarist in our punk band. I see. I-low many of you are in the band? There are four of us. Cantare! This makes you want to sing, huh? We'll go check out some cars and... motorcycles and see what's going on inside. That's right. Wowzers. That's a fine red Corvette. - It sure is. I agree. Listen, Kari. - Great music. Yes. I want to get engaged to Sirkka and marry her... because she's a nice woman and a nice person. She cares about me... and she's chubby enough and big. She's a judo wrestler. She's practiced judo, but that doesn't bother me... because I like judo. It's a nice, intense sport. When it comes to living together,... it's possible that when we've been engaged long enough,... one day in the course of our lives,... we might move in together. That's the plan. I think everyone has the right to make a decision... about where and how they want and would like to live. That's why I wrote a song about it. I don't want to live in a group home. I don't want to live in an institution. I want to live in Kallio. In the privacy of a bomb shelter. Go, Kari! One, two, three, four. I don't want to live in a group home I don't want to live in an institution I want to live in Kallio in the privacy of a bomb shelter Kallio is good, for sure T66I6 is a real bore Kallio will always excite you And there's so much more to do I need a little respect and equality in my life I need a little respect and dignity in my life I don't want to live in a group home I don't want to live in an institution I want to live in a Kallio in the privacy of a bomb shelter Kallio is good, for sure T66I6 is a real bore Kallio will always excite you And there's so much more to do I need a little respect and equality in my life I need a little respect and dignity in my life I love you, yummy yummy yeah Kallio rules! Thank you. Ah, the hum of the forest. I-lave you thought about moving out on your own? - No. Your name is on the waiting list... - I'm not moving anywhere. Your name is on the waiting list for a group home ... - Shut up! I-low do you feel about moving out when you're older? To a group home. When you die. - That's when you'll move out? I won't move to a group home. My home is a good place for me. I'm sure. But we'll go check out the apartment you signed up for. - No, we won't. Oh yes, we will. - No. I won't get dressed. Everything works. Great. One, two, one, two, three, four. I clean my room l cook I microwave a sandwich I watch TV This is fuckin' awesome I have the punk syndrome This is fuckin' awesome I have the punk syndrome it's the brown mark! Then the long gray one. Thanks, that's enough. Stop! Okay let's listen. This is fuckin' awesome I have the punk syndrome Fuck you all! That song couldn't be played any better. - Was it good? Yeah, we did a good job! - Go, us! Good job. - First we'll eat and then we'll record the guitars. Good job. This will be so lovely. Guys, we rock. Yes, we knock. - No, I said, "We rock." Listen. What do we lock? - No, we rock! We're locked? - You mean clock? Pertti, rock. Not knock. Okay. We rock. - That's it, Pertti. The snake attacked me once again. This vest is very poisonous. It has killed 400 people. Kalle's gray green and white jacket isn't poisonous,... but it can strangle people to death. Kalle's green sweater is very poisonous. That's why I don't like to visit Kalle Pajamaa. Were you at my birthday party? - No, I wasn't. When was it? - I threw the party on the 9th. Kari didn't come to my birthday party I have to understand... that people may have other plans and... can't always come to my birthday parties. - More important plans! I was sure Sami hated me. - I don't hate you. It's just that weekends are me-time for me. I know. I see Pertti enough at work. - You sure do. I get it. Shut up, Sami Helle. Fuck you, Sami Helle. I hate Sami Helle. Shut up, Sami Helle. Shut up, Sami Helle. Fuck you, Sami Helle. I hate you, Sami Helle. In twenty-five seconds... we'll have the first official returns of the early vote. You'll see them on the bottom of the big screen. The National Coalition Party The Finnish Social Democratic Party True Finns 18.6 percent. The Centre Party 17.3 percent. According to the early voting results,... you're holding the fourth place. Any comments? This seems like a clear defeat. But let's wait for the final results,... as the margins are still quite small. I'm sad that the support we got during our campaign tour... doesn't show in the votes. Our supporters have been happy with our campaign,... but it seems we havent managed to get enough new voters. So you admit defeat? Mari Kiviniemi, 17.3 percent. What do you think of the results? Where's Toni? Let's continue. - We can't yet. Pertti, what's missing? - Toni. Don't speak into the mic. Where the heck is Toni? He's not here either. Toni. Back to work! Okay you go back to the rehearsal. You should come right away when we ask you. We shouldn't have to come and get you. You understand? - Of course. This is on our schedule today right? - You're right. That's what we'll do then. Okay. - Stop that. Once more and it's lunch break. And then we have one more session. Not a single sound until we start! Punk music is garbage. Complete garbage. I'll throw all my punk records in the trash. I'll keep my schlager albums and Beethoven violin Concertos... and stuff like that. But I'll throw all my punk and other records in the trash today. As soon as possible. I hate Sami Helle. I can't sleep. Fuck! I tried to throw myself under a metro train once. I tried it once. But then someone said,... "Don't throw yourself under the metro train!" "You mustn't do that." Somebody came to me... and said... and said I shouldn't hurt myself. "Don't jump under the metro train." I realized I shouldn't do it. But I almost did. Sami! Sami! Stay strong! You can do it! You can do it! Don't drop them! The time? - 52 seconds! Good job. Sami, are your pants tight enough so they don't fall? - Yeah yeah. Next! - Here! Sami Helle. Stan behind the cone. You'll go when I say "Ready steady go..." - Go! Run! This wasn't my day - No, it was great! That was damn good! That was damn good! That's the world's most malicious laugh. That was great, huh? - Yeah. You don't have to leave empty handed. The winners of the Strongman Competition are... Thank you. Riku Miester! And the winner is Olli Leppkangas from our school! What? I-low do you feel about going to see the group home? I'm very happy There's Liisa, Mikko, Jarkko and Jaakko... And Jokke. - Yeah, Jokke too. And most importantly Liisa lives there. - That's right. Kiss kiss. Hi. - Hello there. I'm Toni. - I-low are you? I'm good. What's your name? - Sat... I'm Toni. - I saw your gig. You remember? Oh, that's right. You were there. - I sure was. When do you plan on moving out on your own? - very soon. You want to move out of your mommy and daddy's house? When you get tired of us and want to move out on your own,... you think this could be the right place? Son of. We have eight residents here... - You should go give Liisa a hug. Is Jarkko at work? - Yes, and Mika too. Hi, Liisa. You have a lovely home. - Thanks. And you have a heat home theater. That's right. Thank you, Toni. - This is for you. Thank you. Come on in. This is my home. So this is your home. - Yes. I-low do you like it here, Liisa? - I like it. It's a lovely place. - Yes. I moved here on April 5th. So you've been here for a long time. - Yup. I-low did you learn to sing? - With my heart. And my chest. And because of love. Are you in love? - Yes. I guess Mika swept you oft your feet a month ago. I guess so. - Mika lives here, too, in his own room. And we play in the same band. That's the way it should be. Why did you kiss me in the karaoke then? It was a friendly kiss. - That's right. But who is Liisa in love with? - With Mika. That's right. Here comes Mika, Liisa's boyfriend. See how she lights up? Mika, hi. - Hi. You want to show your room to Toni? - I'm busy. Okay See you. A melody of footsteps echoes on the street The boy is already waiting by the window All alone because the girl didn't show All alone because the girl didn't show He knows the sound of her footsteps so well He hears it every day And at night his peace of mind has gone astray Even when he's asleep, he waits in vain He wishes that the fall of those French heels would stop and then For one moment, however small He could see the girl again You should show me on your computer... - No, I won't! How babies are made. - No, I won't. In case Sirkka and I want to have a baby That's not my problem. It's none of my business. - It's Kari and Sirkka's problem. You see, I don't want children. I don't ever want to become a dad. Kalle! Sami doesn't want to show me... because he doesn't want to become a father. To show you what? - I-low babies are made. Well, well. Didn't they teach you that in school? Watch this. He wasn't interested in me at all. "I have to go to the gym." You're too good for him, Terhi. Where's Building N? Let's behave ourselves, okay? - You'll be okay. Yeah, yeah. Anyone got a tissue? Oh yes. Hello. - Hello. Here's the kid. - What a lovely baby. We're very grateful that you had a wonderful little child... and we want to give you heartfelt congratulations... with this fine card. It's for you and the little one. - Thank you, Pertti. Is the baby healthy? What a lovely baby! Can he see anything? - He sure can. You mean he can see us? - If you stand close. Why does he keep his eyes shut then? He just woke up. He might be feeling a bit shy Look, this is Pertti. - I'm here. I'm crying tears of joy - That's a good reason to cry. We hope you have a happy family and don't quarrel too much. And that there is no hate. You need warmth and love when you have a small baby He needs warmth, love and loveliness. - He'll get those. I look like my mother. Have you seen the photo? - Yes. My mother died in 1992. I called Koskela Hospital... and asked if my mother was still alive. "Your mother?" they said. "Your mother passed away." I felt very sad. I felt sad because my mother passed away. No one called to tell me... that Pertti Kurikka's mother had passed away They had a funeral for my mother,... but no one told me. Audience, if you wanna dance,... dance, for fuck's sake! They discuss all kinds of things in Parliament But I can't make out what they say They make promises in Parliament And break them everyday I hate Parliament I hate this world I hate Parliament I hate this world I hate this world I hate this world You want to hear more? More, goddammit! Thanks. Toni, Pertti, Kari and Sami, come to the office. Come here. Come on in. - Let's go, Pertti Kurikka's Name Day Let's see what's in here.

Congratulationsl Well, I'm actually having my engagement party today That sounds great. You have a lot of gigs and people are buying your records. People know you better. Do people come up to you and say hi? Like, "Kari, what's up?" - Yes. Sometimes strangers will come up to me in Kallio and say,... "You're the singer of Pertti Kurikka's Name Day" But I don't mind; I'm cool with it. Sounds good. I'm glad you could make it to our show. Have a nice summer and good gigs. - Thank you. It's Kari. At least you didn't chicken out. - No. At last. We've been waiting five years. Which hand? Beautiful. Congratulations! - Congratulations, Sirkka and Kari! Congratulationsl Everyone wants to clink their glasses. Congratulations, Kari! - Thank you. I-low does it feel to be engaged? It's been a busy day but... one has to move ahead in life and have a woman. When you're 35, you have to settle down with a woman. I'm not a teenager any more. Even though I have gigs and all,... I like to spend as much time with Sirkka as possible... when I don't have gigs. One must take care of both business and women. Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye? - Of course I am. See you. - Sure. I'll come visit you next week. - It's a date. Bye bye, Finland! - Bye bye, activity center! It was nice knowing you. See you around! See you in December! - December?

I'll tell you how it goes. That's the kind of guy I am. I'm a tough guy You don't want to piss me off. I'd be happy to break a finger. I don't want to hang out with anyone. I'm not friends with anyone. That's the way it is. I'm not friends with anyone. My hatred is growing. I hate Sami Helle. I'll hit Sami Helle. Where are you taking us? - There's a... - Fuck. There's the Beatles memorial, if you're interested. I'm sorry I got a bit angry - it's okay There's so much on my mind. You must be tired. You've been working so hard. Yes, I'm tired.
