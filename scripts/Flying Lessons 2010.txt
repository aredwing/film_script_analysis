Look, I'm sorry, okay? I think you should leave. No. I'm still here, Sophie. I'm still here. I'm not the one who leaves. And that's my fault how? No, that's not what I'm saying. Then what are you saying? I love you. You do? Why? Because I do. Well, I don't love you. I don't. Except I know you do. ( rings doorbell ) Sorry about that, harry. It's because she can't have kids. Bernice. We've been trying for years. Now she wants to adopt. Harry: And you talk about these things- Suddenly find yourself talking about these things, All these things you never wanted to talk about. Should we not tell her? My Lucy? When the time is right... But it's never right. It's never the time. And my advance, when can I expect that? Within 24 hours. Oh. Right here. She's my Lucy. She's my Lucy. Now the mother wants to meet her and say hello, And I'm not even her real father. Harry: Lyin' to everyone all these years... Here I am trying to make the rules. Be careful. Look both ways! ( tires screeching ) If your father was not the person you thought he was, Is that something you'd want to know? My father's dead. He died. Do you remember him? You see? That's what I'm afraid of. ( car door closes ) It was me and you. It was supposed to be me and you getting out of this town, And then what, I miss a pill? I don't even know. What I do know is that It wasn't me and you anymore, Sophie; it was you. I wanted one thing that you had, And the only thing that you left behind... Was Billy. He doesn't want me. He wants you. He has always wanted you. You gotta believe me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Milla. ( sighs deeply ) I don't know what to do. ( laughs ) Do you love him? ( revving engine ) Soph. - Hey. - Hey. So...

You wanted to know what he did, my dad. When that girl was twenty-one, Lucy... He hit her. He was drunk. Doesn't even remember it. He hit her with this car. This car. And she died. I tell everyone that he's a loser. I tell everyone that I hate him. None of that's true. I don't hate him. Maybe he's never gonna come home. He's probably not gonna ever come home. But I don't hate him. I miss him. I really miss him. ( sniffling ) I love you. Even when I wasn't here... Even when I couldn't say it. ( sniffling ) You're not him, Billy. We're not them. Not these things. These aren't our things. Yes, they are. They are. # good-bye, my hopeless dream I'm trying not to think about you # # can't you just let me be? # # so long, my luckless romance # # my back # is turned on you Sophie. # shoulda known you'd bring me heartache # I'm sorry. # oh, most lovers always do # - Good morning. - Good morning.

(slurring) maybe a little more modern. What do you think? I think you're... drunk. Yeah, I guess I am. Want to know why? I don't know. Because it's a Wednesday? No, I'm- I'm drunk because I'm all alone. And pretty soon... Very soon... I'm gonna be all alone with no place to be all alone. What do you mean? You were right about Steven, honey. It was all a big lie. And I signed off on it. ( sighs ) Remember this jacket? It was your daddy's. Mmm. He always wore it to the ballet, remember? You said we wouldn't talk about him. I'm all alone here, Sophie. I can't fix this. What do you want from me? You mean other than acting like you could give a shit? Okay. Those questions that they asked you were not all that- No, no. I'm not going back into it, mom. Sophie, just- just-just listen. You said you wouldn't do this. That insurance money... I need money- you said you wouldn't do this. I know. Mom, you said you wouldn't. I know, I know, I know. Just if there was something that you could tell them. There's not! (stammering ) a statement, anything, If they could just ask you a few questions, a few more questions. I've already told you there's nothing to remember, and that is never gonna change! I need that fucking money. That's fine. No, it's fine. I'll just sell it all. Is that what you want? Everything we have to the highest bidder. That's fine. Honey, please, I just- All... All they want to know... All they want to know... Is that you saw him, honey. You-you saw, right? And he was... He was okay, he was- he was fine. I mean, he wasn't... He wasn't suicidal, for god's sake, I mean, that wasn't- that wasn't daddy. What? What? I wanted it to be a surprise... So I came home early. I saw a light on in the barn. ( coughing in distance ) ( man sobbing ) I didn't even... Know that dad had a gun. He told me that he loved me. And that I was... A good girl. And he told me to go inside. And I said, "no matter what it is, we can just forget about it and start over." No, I don't believe you. You're lying. Then he asked me where you were. Ha. I was at dinner. No, you weren't. I saw you. ( dialing ) ( line ringing ) ( door opens ) Whoa! ( laughing ) What are you saying? You were always with him. Dad knew. Shut up! I told him that if he was gonna do it that he should do it... Operator: 911. Please state your emergency. ...But I wasn't going inside. ( door opens, closes ) Thanks. Harry: Hmm. 1972 ford ranchero 500. Beautiful car. # on my back # fall asleep # never know what it means to dream # # on my back # fall asleep # never know what it means to dream... # My cab's here. New York, huh? Yeah. Wow. So, uh, call me when you get there? I think about him too, you know. I think about him. I think about him every day. Just like you. Every day. Every moment. Sophie... Sophie... He was sick, honey. It wasn't your fault. You couldn't have stopped him. You couldn't have, there was nothing you could have done. It wasn't your fault. I know. Listen, um... I'll call you when I get there. Okay. I'll, uh, get the door for you. Bye, mom. Harry: Before I started losing 'em I was pretty sure that, when you get down to it, The facts, I'm sayin', Memories are all you really have. They're all that make you real or... Separate you from what comes next. ( starts car ) Without memories you don't really exist, All you are hasn't even... Happened yet... ...Your future. Like an anchor, kinda, Keepin' a foothold on what's what and who's who. But now I'm not so sure. That's all just bad thinkin', because... How's a man supposed to fly? Live his life? I mean... ...If he's got everything anchored down in yesterday? Doesn't give tomorrow much of a chance... Now, does it? # tie my shoelaces # just to see me fall # the bloodshot eyes of a porcelain doll # # and entertain me # laugh at my expense # the quiet scares me much more # # oh at last, do it with grace # # I feel I'm falling down # and with no time erased # no regrets, mama # no mistakes # one act of kindness deserves another # # I will catch you, babe # steal the moon just to watch and find some peace # # at the road where love and laughter meet # # I will miss thee, daddy # oh, can't you hear? # flying high under trepid fear # # oh at last, do it with grace # # I feel I'm falling down # and with no time erased # no regrets, mama # no mistakes # one act of kindness deserves another # # I will catch you, babe # I'm yours if you # have courage to be true # I'm yours if you # have courage to be true # I'm yours if you-oo-oo-oo # have courage to be true # I feel I'm falling down # and with no time erased # no regrets, mama # no mistakes # one act of kindness deserves another # # and I will promise # to catch you, babe
