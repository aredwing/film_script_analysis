PEOPLE OFTEN PROJECT NEGATIVE IMAGES ABOUT YOU, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK DIFFERENT. WE HAVE TWO COMMUNITIES LIVING SIDE-BY-SIDE, BUT HAVING VERY LITTLE INTERACTION WITH EACH OTHER EXCEPT WHEN SOMETHING NEGATIVE GOES DOWN. YOU COULD HAVE LUBAVITCH HASIDIM, INSTEAD HAVE MANY MORE PEOPLE LIVING IN TOO SMALL A SPACE, LIVING ONE ON TOP OF ANOTHER IN APARTMENT HOUSES AND SO ON. UM, SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT JEWS HAVE MORE A PIECE OF THE PIE. DURING AN ECONOMICALLY DEPRESSED PERIOD WITH HIGH CRIME AND STEREOTYPICAL IMAGES ON BOTH SIDES -- WHITE PERSON SAYS, WELL, NO, THE BLACKS ARE THE ENEMY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL ON WELFARE, AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE NOTHING, AND THEY'RE SLACKS AND THEY'RE SMOKERS. I DON'T THINK BLACK PEOPLE HATE JEWS. I THINK THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND US. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH US WHEN THEY SEE US. THEY TEND TO BE SO SEPARATE, NOT JUST LOOKING SEPARATE BUT BEING SEPARATE. SOME OF US DON'T TRUST THE JEWS. MAYBE HE THINKS THAT I THINK THAT I'M BETTER THAN HIM BECAUSE I'M RELIGIOUS, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT I THINK. THEY DON'T LIKE US BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR OWN CULTURE, WE LOOK DIFFERENT, WE DRESS DIFFERENT, WE HAVE OUR OWN WAYS, YOU KNOW, AND THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH IT.

HEY, YOUNG BROTHERS. HELP SPREAD THE PEACE. WE GOING TO TALK TOGETHER. SO YOU REALLY TRYING TO GET US TO TALK TO SOME JEWS, HUH? YEAH, MAN, WHY SHOULD WE? WE HAVE TO FIX THIS MESS. YOU KNOW WE GOT TO LIVE TOGETHER. BLOW IT OUT, MAN. THAT'S JUST NOISE. HOW YOU DOING, T.J.? I'M ALL RIGHT. YOUR DAD BEEN AROUND? IT'S NO BIG THING, YOU KNOW? YEAH, IT'S A BIG THING, MAN. BUT YOUR DAD'S STUFF -- THAT'S NO REFLECTION ON YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? YEAH. ALL RIGHT. I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU AT THIS MEETING, MAN. TAKE IT EASY, T.J. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] I'M NOT INTERESTED. SORRY. THE MEETINGS ARE SUPERVISED, AND WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT IT'S SAFE FOR EVERYONE THERE. LOOK, I DON'T CARE. LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. TA, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU -- I-I KNOW THIS IS TOUGH FOR YOU -- AND FOR BOTH OF YOU. YOU -- YOU WERE ATTACKED. THIS IS PERSONAL. NO, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT US. WHAT ABOUT THE ONES WHO LOOT AND START FIRES? WHAT ABOUT THE GUY WHO KILLED YANKEL ROSENBAUM? YOU'RE GOING TO CONDEMN AN ENTIRE PEOPLE FOR THE RUTHLESS ACTS OF A FEW? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO? I DON'T -- UH... I DON'T KNOW. WELL, COME TO A MEETING, AND YOU'LL KNOW MORE. WHAT IF THE GUYS WHO ATTACKED US ARE THERE? THEN WE'LL HAVE THEM ARRESTED. I HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE. [ SIGHS ] THANK YOU, RIVKA, MOSHE. LAZ. I'LL LET MYSELF OUT. THANKS A LOT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. IT'S A SILLY IDEA. WHY ARE YOU PRESSURING HIM? WHO'S PRESSURING? I DON'T WANT HIM TO HATE. I'M NOT HATING ANYONE. I HATE WHAT THEY DO. LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE WHEN WE WERE IN COLLEGE. THERE'S NO MORE LEARNING TO DO? NOT WHEN IT PUTS OUR CHILD IN DANGER. I'M NOT A CHILD. YOU ARE A CHILD. OKAY, I UNDERSTAND THERE'S FEAR, BUT WE CAN'T LET IT RULE OUR LIVES. RIGHT, YUDI? I'M NOT AFRAID. IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULDN'T GO TO THAT MEETING, IS THERE? MOSHE, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HE'S GOING TO GET HURT. NO, HE WON'T. HE'LL BE FINE. WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS ARGUING WITH ME, RIVKA? WE LIVE SEPARATE. WE WANT TO LIVE THIS WAY, AND AFTER ALL, AMERICA IS ABOUT LIVING THE WAY YOU WANT TO LIVE. WE LIVE THIS WAY, AND WE AREN'T HARMING ANYONE ELSE. OUR CHILDREN, THEY SPEND ALL DAY STUDYING THE TORAH. THEY DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE. I AIN'T ADVOCATING ALL THIS COMING TOGETHER. HEALING AMERICA IS BULLSHIT. Laz: ALL RIGHT. Paul: GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M GLAD TO SEE MORE OF YOU SHOWED UP THIS TIME. HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO A FEW MINUTES OF THIS, AND THEN I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT THE THEME IS AND WHO YOU THINK THE SINGER IS. [ HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ] KNOW IT'S BEEN SAID ABOUT A MILLION TIMES BEFORE BUT CHANGE DON'T COME EASY, YOU GOTTA KNOW THE SCORE LOOKIN' FOR A FRIEND, LIKE A LIFELONG BROTHER? YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY LOOKIN' AT THE COVER WE NEED TO STOP THE FIGHTING, WE NEED MORE PEACE LOVE IN THE STREETS, DON'T CONDONE THE BEEF DON'T-DON'T-DON'T, DON'T CONDONE THE BEEF DON'T-DON'T, DON'T CONDONE THE BEEF UNITY IN THE COMMUNITY IS WHAT WE NEED YES, INDEED, WE NEED TO INTERCEDE SHALOM THAT HAS GOT TO BE VANILLA ICE, MAN. IT'S NOT VANILLA ICE. YEAH, THAT'S TOO MUCH CREDIT, MAN. THAT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEASTIE BOYS. DEFINITELY A WHITE, THOUGH, RIGHT? WELL, YOU GOT -- YEAH, YOU GOT SOME OF THAT RIGHT. IT'S, UH, IT'S ME. [ BOYS LAUGHING ] I ACTUALLY RECORDED THIS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. I WAS FED UP WITH ALL THE RACIAL HATRED GOING ON -- YOU KNOW, BENSONHURST, HOWARD BEACH. THE POINT HERE IS THAT WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON WITH EACH OTHER THAN SOME OF US THINK WE DO. LOOK, WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE, WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS GET EVERYBODY TALKING, GET TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OPEN DIALOGUE. IT'S A FREE FORUM. YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT, NO HOLDS BARRED. JUST ASK ANY QUESTION YOU WANT AND GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. OKAY, SO IF YOU WANT TO ASK THESE GUYS A QUESTION... GO AHEAD. ONE OF YOU ALL WANT TO ASK ONE OF THESE HASIDIC GENTLEMEN A QUESTION? OPEN IT UP. NOTHING'S -- NOTHING'S TOO PRIVATE TO ASK. JUST KICK IT OUT. ALL RIGHT. WHY Y'ALL BE WEARING THOSE BEANIES? OOH, SERIOUS ISSUE, MAN. GOOD ONE. THEY'RE CALLED YARMULKES. WHY DO YOU WEAR THEM? TO HONOR HASHEM. WHO? THE NAME -- WHAT YOU'D CALL GOD. WHY DON'T YOU GOT THOSE CURLS LIKE THE JEWS IN WILLIAMSBURG? THEY STILL LOOK LIKE UNDERTAKERS. AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE STRING THINGS HANGING OUT YOUR CLOTHES? THEY'RE CALLED TSITSIS. TITTIES?! [ LAUGHING ] IT SAYS IN THE TORAH -- HEY -- THAT IS OUR HOLY BOOK. GO AHEAD. FOUR KNOTS REMIND YOU THAT GOD IS IN ALL DIRECTIONS. EVERYWHERE. WHY DO YOU GUYS WEAR YOUR HAIR LIKE THAT? LIKE WHAT? THIS? DREADS. WE GROW IT. WE DON'T WEAR IT LIKE THIS. AND, WHAT, YOU GROW IT LIKE THAT WITH MUD? MUD? WHAT? SOME PEOPLE WEAR I JUST FOR THE LOOK, BUT THE RASTAFARIANS IN JAMAICA STARTED TO GROW THEIR HAIR LIKE THIS AS A SIGN OF PRIDE. WE ARE PROUD OF THE TEXTURE OF OUR HAIR, AND FURTHERMORE, IT SAYS IT IN OUR BIBLE -- IN OUR LEVITICUS, JAH SAID, "THOU SHALL NOT CUT OFF THY HAIR OFF THY HEAD." YOU READ TORAH? TORAH? HEAR ME, MAN, WE -- MY PEOPLE, THAT IS -- ARE THE ORIGINAL LOST TRIBE. [ LAUGHING ] SO HOW COME YOU GUYS WEAR ALL BLACK? SO WE DON'T SHOOT EACH OTHER OVER SNEAKERS AND JACKETS LIKE YOU DO. THAT'S WHACKED. YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY? IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT? [ ALL TALKING AT ONCE ] HEY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, LET'S SEE -- CAN WE JUST SEE IF WE CAN HOLD OFF MAKING ACCUSATIONS ABOUT EACH OTHER, OKAY? YOU KNOW WHAT? TAKE A SECOND. LOOK AT YOUR FEET. LOOK AT YOUR SHOES, MAN. YOU SEE, THE JEWISH KIDS ARE ALL WEARING BLACK SHOES. AND THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOYS ARE ALL WEARING SNEAKERS -- HIGH-TOPS. LOOK AT THAT. SO THAT'S -- THAT'S WHAT? THAT'S CULTURE, RIGHT? THEY GOT THEIR UNIFORM, YOU GOT YOUR UNIFORM. DOESN'T MEAN ONE'S BETTER THAN THE OTHER. LISTEN, MAN, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW Y'ALL GET SPECIAL TREATMENT. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? I GET HASSLED ALL THE TIME 'CAUSE I'M BLACK. YEAH, THAT'S 'CAUSE THE COPS KNOW THAT WE DON'T COMMIT THE CRIMES. WE'RE NOT BREAKING INTO HOMES. WE'RE NOT STEALING CAR RADIOS LIKE -- NEITHER DO I. WHAT, BECAUSE I'M BLACK, I'M A CRIMINAL? LISTEN, WE GET HASSLED BY THE COPS, TOO. I GOT ATTACKED, AND THEY ACTED LIKE I WAS THE CRIMINAL. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT, WHITE BOY? YOU EVER BEEN PULLED OFF THE STREETS AND BEATEN BY COPS? WELCOME TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT'S RIGHT. HEY, YO, THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS THAT SOME JEW LET A LITTLE BLACK BOY DIE BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK OF US AS HUMANS. THAT'S BULLCRAP, MAN. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE. COME ON! IT IS TRUE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, MAN? YOUR AMBULANCE TOOK AWAY THAT JEWISH DRIVER, NOT THE KID. THAT GUY IN THAT AMBULANCE WON A MEDAL FOR RESCUING A BLACK KID FROM A FIRE JUST WEEKS AGO. LETTING THAT KID DIE WAS AN ATTACK ON ALL BLACKS. NOBODY KILLED THAT KID. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. HOLD UP, HOLD UP. WE HAVE A CHOICE HERE, MEN. WE CAN LET OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BE A WAR ZONE, RIGHT? OR WE CAN GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. IF WE DON'T GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER AS ALIENS, AS STRANGERS, AS THE ENEMY. UNDERSTAND THAT? IT'S A CHOICE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS? THE TRUTH IS THAT IF YOU CUT ANY OF US OPEN, WE ALL LOOK THE SAME, RIGHT? BUT DO WE HAVE TO DO THAT TO KNOW IT? YOU HAVE A CHOICE RIGHT HERE. YANKEL ROSENBAUM DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE. THEY KILLED HIM JUST 'CAUSE HE WAS A JEW. THE JEWS STARTED IT BY KILLING THAT KID. YO, MAN, WE COULD GO BACK AND FORTH ALL DAY ABOUT WHAT WE DISAGREE ON, BUT I GOT HOMEWORK TO DO.
