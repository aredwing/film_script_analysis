Tomo will dive. Hurry! It's no good watching him. You really like him. I sure do! But why? He'll dive! Alright! Now! Quite a dive! Cut it out already! You don't pay attention! You must watch out! Ryo! Don't take off his pants when I'm diving! Did you see it? Sure I did. No way! You're just looking for an excuse. I'm telling you I saw it. No way! Ouch! Hey! He saw it? - He didn't. - Let's go. But Tomo said he did. How many members? 16 elementary schoolers, 8 junior high students, and 1 in senior high, 25 in total. I see. Wow, she's a looker! Yeah, she's hot! Who is she? Tomo, over there! Who is she? Everyone, come here! Let's go! Meet your new coach, Ms. Kayoko Asaki. Quiet! She'll help with your training. I'm Ryo Ohiro, the best junior high diver here. Dive. Instead of introductions, I want you all to dive. Forward, back, anything. I'll go first! Ryo Ohiro! Enough! You can come down. No need to dive. Next! Reiji Maruyama! I'll do 103! Next! You couldn't pull it off. Daisuke Inoue. I'm ready! Enough. Next! Tomoki Sakai, ready. Tomo only? Really? He'll jump? Enough. Come down. But why? Come here! Yoichi will dive. He'll do it. Wow! Almost no splash. He's good! Make the last rotation 1/4 faster. It will make entry easier. Hold that image, and try again. The rest will practice the initial position. What? Why? You can't dive right if you can't stand right. Get down now! Yes, Miss. Hurry! What's the initial position? You don't know? The boys are standing. Yeah, I see. Wow! Shoot! She won't let us dive. We've been doing this for 2 hours. This sucks! Stupid exercises only. We aren't beginners. You there, Sakai? Yes. Are your parents divers? Huh, no. Not at all... Are they athletes? No. You've got hyperflexible joints, and long arms and legs. What's more... Well, anyway... Take this. You can practice outside the pool. But... Tomo, what's this? I'm back. Hi, Tomo! "Don't wear socks at home. " "Refine the sensitivity of your feet. " Hey, Tomo. You must knock. What's this? What? You just missed Miu. Oops. Get lost. Now! Hello. Miu, hello. I'm so sorry I forgot... It's so nice that you called. I'm sorry. I went shopping with a friend, and bought a cute jellyfish toy. Jellyfish? Want to see it? It looks like you. Me? I want to see it. I'll show it to you at school. And when I was... One. Two. Three. The stomach! Keep your head up! Crouch lower! Nine. Fifty. OK, stop! Keep the pose. Five minutes. Five minutes? I'm done. I've had enough. Get back! Can't take it. I'll talk to the coach. Wait! Why are you letting her coach us? We want you to be our coach! Quiet! You know the club is having financial problems. The parent company wants us closed. Coach Asaki convinced them to give us another chance. Why? She's the granddaughter of the late chairman. The board members have no interest in diving. They'll keep the club, under one condition. What condition? The Olympics. MDC must produce an Olympic diver. That's why I'm here. So I'll compete in the Olympics? The Olympics is the goal? Who knows? The Olympics is not for us. Yeah. Maybe Yoichi can make it. He's the son of Coach Fujitani. A thoroughbred diver. If my parents were Olympic divers... No way. Not even then. Still, the new coach has big hopes for Tomo. A pony with no pedigree. What's that? I didn't say that. Cut it! Hiro. Yes? These are your favorite dishes. Tomo, you never wear socks. Why? Well, I... Tell me... What? Do you have any ambitions for me? Any special hopes? Just that you're healthy and happy, right? We love you just the way you are. So Ms. Asaki is the girl who hurt her back and had to retire. Went to the US to study coaching. Thank you. Are you already done? You can break your diet now and then. You want him to quit diving? It was a joke. Never joke about this. The fate of the club depends on him. Right? Yes. As for your practice, do you want to train with Ms. Asaki? No. I want you to stay my coach. Alright. So you're doing self-training. Yes. First, physical training! Competitions are long and exhausting. Strength and concentration are indispensable. Yes. I promise you one thing. You'll become better. Pain is the price you have to pay to grow. And from the top... You'll see a view no one else can see. Once more. Tomo? Are you free today? Today... We're going to Ishii's today. Can you come? I have practice... Diving again? We'll ask someone else. Sorry. Maybe next... Check my legs when I dive today. What's wrong? Why are you so excited? About the Olympics? She doesn't think you can make it. Ms. Asaki scouted a new diver. From Aomori. Who's that? Who? OK, go! What a splash! The water stinks. Come here. Meet the new member, Shibuki Okitsu. He won't be your buddy, but your rival. Compete with each other! This is Yoichi Fujitani. A three-time junior high champion, and MDC's No. 1 diver. Wow, perfect! Cool! Can you dive like this? He's fast! The splash! He's the best! A perfect twist. Wow! That was quite a splash. No matter how good you are, you can't score with such a splash. So I should hold myself down so I don't splash? Tomo, let's go for ( okonomiyaki )! Or sweet beans. Maybe next time. The doomed super diver? Yeah, a famous diver in the 1930s. Because of the War, he couldn't compete in the Olympics. His name was Shiraha Okitsu. The new boy's grandfather. They both used to dive from the Tsugaru cliffs. He thinks pool diving sucks. So why is he here? Revenge... I guess. Revenge? For his grandfather. You both are amazing. The son of Olympic athletes, and the grandson of a super diver. I feel like I want to quit. But I think you're my real rival. Really? Of course not. You can't even control your calorie intake. Coach Asaki said to Coach Fujitani... What? That you have diamond eyes. Diamond eyes? Thank you. Hello. Coach Fujitani, may I? Take a look. The Beijing training camp trial? Yes. A camp for young divers from Asia in August. The former Chinese team coach will train them. Coach Sun? COACHING STAFF:. SUN WEl So the Swimming Federation will choose the Olympic divers from the camp participants? Definitely. You're in charge. Thank you. Do your best. One spot in the Olympic Squad is for the diver with the best results and experience: Kenichiro Teramoto. Mayl... A shortcut to the Olympics is to finish in the Top 3 of this competition and go to the training camp. MDC can send 3 divers to the trials. I already chose them. And they are:. Yoichi Fujitani, Shibuki Okitsu, and Tomoki Sakai. Wow, Tomo! That's all. Tomo, you made it! You rock! You worked really hard. - It's drinking water. - Cute. It's having fun. Yeah. It looks yummy! I woke up early to make it. Mom helped too. I was thinking to do calorie intake control. Why? The physique is very important in diving. I was selected for a very important competition. And I don't know what to do. It feels like I'm losing you. Sorry. So much is expected of me, for the first time. Until now, no one expected much of me. Just an ordinary boy. Which wasn't bad, but I felt cramped. Being ordinary is a bit stifling. If I become a good diver, I might be free. Let's eat. Well? It's good! Yummy! Let's go. One, two, three. Did you see the mat? Yes. OK, next three turns. Three turns! Ready? One, two, three. See, you did it. Saw the mat? Yes. OK, once more. Ready! TO THE OLYMPICS! (YEAH, RIGHT!) I CAN DO IT! (MAYBE) Ryo! You can't give up! I won't let you. We worked so hard. I kept waiting. For the coach with a sharp eye, who would discover me. And when that coach finally shows up, she chose Tomo! Ryo! Ryo! It's not your fault that he left. Don't worry. Diving is an individual sport. With each win, you get lonelier. Was he supposed to meet you here? Yes... Don't worry. He's just late. He'll be back soon. Alright! Entry position. 105B. 2.5 turns, at 10. Tomo! Wow! 2.5 turns! He did it. The diamond eyes... What? Don't know. I did it! This is easy. Just the first step. You know what's next? 107, 3.5 turns. What? I hardly managed 2.5. It's impossible. That's why! If you make it, you'll be a star. What? Stop it! Once again! That's all? Where did you go with Miu? How did you...? Why? Why do you have this? Tomo... I'm sorry. Sorry. I don't believe it. Stop it! He confessed, and you chose him? It's true! Why did you confess? She was my girlfriend. So what! I knew you had problems. It was hard for Miu. You didn't see it. We had no problems. And all the broken promises? I had to practice... And Miu... You are important to me! Liar! Liar... Miu! SAKAl ABSEN I'll make ice tea... I won't be long. Every minute is precious! What happened? My brother stole my girlfriend. Girlfriend? Your brother? Stole her? You fool! What? Return to the pool! No way! You must! You don't need me. You have Yoichi and Shibuki. They'll make it to the Olympics. They don't matter. This is your problem. Or will you just give up? I gave it all up! My girlfriend, my friends, everything. I gave up sweets, too. And for what? He had everything, and he stole her! It's not fair. Really? I don't think so. You have something that no one else has. What? The gift a diver would kill for. Diamond eyes. Will it help me beat Yoichi and Shibuki? The ability to grasp a large amount of visual information in an instant. Momentary vision. You're born with it. Divers who have it can see when to turn and stretch as a still image. It's not much use in daily life. But in diving, it's a big advantage for high-level performance. That's "diamond eyes. " 3.5 turns? Tomo did 3.5 turns! You're kidding? What went wrong? Just doing the turns is not enough. You must perfect the entry. Once again. Yes. It's getting interesting. Alright! Wow! He did it! 3.5 turns! Once again, while it's still fresh. OK! BEIJlNG TRAINlNG CAMP TRIALS Let's get started. Coach Sun. Are you nervous? Don't be stupid. How can you not be? Welcome to the 2007 Beijing International Training Camp Trials. Small audience. Diving is not very popular. I thought you won't come. But if they don't win, the club... Don't worry! Let's cheer them! It's beginning. There are 6 types of dives. Forward, back, inverse, reverse, twist... Twist? And armstand. Armstand? All dives have a degree of difficulty, DD. The DD times the points awarded by referees determine the score. This diver didn't use the 1 Om in order to raise his DD. Next, 305C, 1 Om. DD 2.7. Tomoki Sakai, Mizuki Diving Club. 8.5, 9, 8.5, 9. 8.5, 8, 8.5. Score:. 68.85. He did it! Wow! Tomo did it! It's the first time he's got a 9. Shibuki...? What happened? It's not like him. Really? 9.5, 9.5, 8.5, 9, 9. Score:. 78.30. What are you doing? You told me not to raise a splash. I didn't tell you to dive like a coward. Is that how you dive? Or is it because of your back? What do you mean? Don't try to fool me. I know you've hurt your back. With this diving, you'll easily make the second place. But nothing more... Nothing. Don't you want to know how your grandfather felt? Far from the sea, standing on that platform? Don't you? With this diving, you'll never know. The great feeling to dive in front of an adoring audience. The feeling? Yes. Once you feel that, you won't be able to give up diving. Next, 107B, 10m. DD 3.0, Shibuki Okitsu. High! Wow! It's high. So fast! Wow! This is our Shibuki! 7, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 6, 6, 5.5. Score:. 58.50. Shibuki's seventh. And Tomo is fourth. Let's go! Why did he drop to fourth? The DD was low. He can't go up, even if the score is high. He must do his best, to make it into the top 3. He'll do the 3.5 turns. Next, 107C, 10m. DD 2.7, Sakai. 3.5 turns. He did it! He did it, right? He'll make it! He was close! The entry wasn't perfect. Score:. 56.70. Total score:. 367.75. 4. TOMOKI SAKAl. Next 5152B, 10m, DD 2.9, Fujitani. Clean! No splash! Smooth entry! Score:. 79.75. Everyone, come here! The selected camp members are:. No. 1 Fujitani. No. 2 Matsuno. And... Sakai. These three. Why? No way. It's true. But I was fourth. It's Coach Sun's decision. He thinks diving is more, than just earning points. So he chose Tomo? That's all. Wow, two divers from MDC. But Shibuki... Tomo, smile! If the winners don't smile, the losers must cry. You're going to Beijing. Yes, Tomo! Smile! You can't win anyway. Don't fall behind in Beijing. You won the audience. You couldn't make the camp with the injury. The Olympics is not everything. Right? It's not like you. I don't want you to lose. I couldn't take it. When I injured my back. My world ended when I didn't make the Olympic team. Maybe I was wrong. I can't think now. I don't regret that I came here. Now I know how Grandpa felt. Shibuki. I'll go to Beijing. To become better. A diver everyone admires, like you. You get better. Hey! It was a good competition. I enjoyed it. It's so not... like you. Ouch! Idiot. Watch it. You suck. "Coach Asaki," "How's everyone at MDC?' "Yoichi and I are OK." "What is Shibuki doing in Tsugaru?' "I'm sending you pics of our practice. " What is it? An email from Sakai. He's improved his technique. Is it because of Shibuki? You sound down. No... I let him go back to Tsugaru. You did the right thing. It's his choice. I'll get ready. The boys are coming back tomorrow. Didn't Sakai write you? What? Hey there! Oh, hi! Take this. Thanks! Kyoko. I got it! Thank you. I'll ask Granny to make sashimi and soup. OK. Good. Delicious! Let's go to a spa. I have to get up early. A day trip then. I've waited so long. OK, let's go. Where? To Sukayu? No. Aoni then? I like it! Let's go. When? Next week? OK, I'll take a day off! Shibuki! You dived here? Do you still dive? No, I was busy this summer. With what? Sex, mainly. You've had... a nice summer. I envy you. I won't go back. But why? I can dive here... It's vast, the water is clean. But you have no audience, and no rivals. No coach. No one is looking at you. Is it any fun? I want to dive with you. In the pool. The pool is small, but it's not so bad. I've changed too. I trained hard in China to be able to compete with you. I wonder... Who missed practice cause of a broken heart? How did you...? You told Reiji and Sachi, and the rest. But I've changed! Hey! Fool! Let's do it! Won't you stay over? We have practice. I see. It's a secret, but Coach Sun chose you. If it wasn't for the injury, you'd have gone. Tomo worked real hard. It's your turn. Sorry. Let's go, Tomo. We'll be waiting for you. Here. It came 3 days ago. COACH KAYOKO ASAKl Shiraha Okitsu... Grandpa! Grandpa. He looks so happy. What's this? Last time, you went to Tokyo because of your Grandpa. This time, go for yourself. Really? Do your best, lose and come back home. 1 Om! How's your back? It's OK. Alright. Fujitani, 10m. Higher! Head up! A bit to the right. Have you heard of the swan dive? Swan dive? Your grandfather's favorite technique. 101A. Forward straight dive. But beautiful, like a swan. I'm sure you can do it. Swan dive... In the air it was good. Follow through to entry. OK. What? I want to try 207B. A 3.5 back dive, now? That is your weak group. I want to become better. It's unnecessary. You must perform a perfect composition. Don't get any ideas. The future of MDC depends on you. Don't forget it. Yes. Yes, I understand. Yes, thank you. Goodbye. What happened? Actually... Everyone, come here! I just got a call from the Federation. They've decided on the Olympic squad. Why so early? Who will go? Two divers. Kenichiro Teramoto. And from MDC, Yoichi Fujitani. Fujitani, get ready. We'll go to the Federation. We're leaving in 10 minutes. Fujitani. But why, why? Usually the squad is announced much later. It's too early. There should be three spots anyway. Enough. No, it's not. You worked so hard. What's going on? Chairman Maehara reduced the number to 2 to secure medals. If Teramoto's teammate does a low-level jump, Teramoto's image will suffer. Do you understand? Just do what you have to do. Let's go. FUJITANl ABSEN Hello. It's me. Papa? Is he still sick? I guess so. He won't leave his room. You guess? Ask him yourself. You're his father. We don't need a coach at home. Yes? Yoichi, it's for you. So what do you think? It doesn't feel right. I've lost motivation. It's the first time I've skipped practice. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Don't miss it. It doesn't feel real. A perfect composition. The best teammate for Teramoto. MDC savior Yoichi Fujitani. That's ridiculous. Let me show you something. OK, 10m! 4.5 turns? You don't get it. Hold your legs lower. Again. He's training twice as hard. Again, 10m. OK, see you. Enough for today. You're exhausted. One last dive. No, I said enough. Do you hear me? Just one! I said no! Get down here! Support his head. OK. I'm sorry. I'm fine now. You scared us. But it's good that you're OK. Why did you do it? The Olympic dream is over. Why do you keep doing it? The dream may be over, but the dragon is still alive. Dragon? The concrete dragon. The first diving tower I saw looked so huge and powerful. Like a big dragon. The concrete dragon. That's what I've been calling it since then. As long as the dragon lived, I had a chance. A chance? To be free. I felt so cramped by the limits. Crushed in a tiny box. Limits? The early selection of only two divers, and the ambitions for medals are limits. But, making the 4.5 turns is far beyond that. Very far! That's why I want to dive. What is it? Do you know Chairman Maehara? He was a friend of my grandfather. I must see him. What for? I'm a busy person. You have 5 minutes. Actually, 4. What do you want? I withdraw from the Olympic team. Alright. I'll think about it. Let me explain. There's nothing to explain. There's still time. I thought you were a smart boy. Does your father know? The coach doesn't matter. By quitting, you jeopardize the future of your club. Your father will suffer the most. I guess dad is my limit. I don't understand. He's not my father. He's just my coach. All my life, I've been diving for dad and the club. That's my limit. With each win, I get lonelier. I never questioned it. But it's over. The thrill is gone. Is that all? Yes. Time's up. The star of Japan's diving, Kenichiro Teramoto, received a ticket to the Olympics. His excellent performance in the World Series gave him a spot in the team. I am sorry for what I did. Fool! Should I tell them? Go ahead. The Federation will hold trials to decide who will take the one remaining spot. The winner must get at least 500 points. 500? That's tough. No way. It's impossible. Right now, Teramoto is the only diver who can raise this score. Chairman Maehara is ready to send a one-man team. We won't let him. I'll raise 500 points. We can do it. Sure we can. Let's go! What? Is it true you'll resign? If no one makes the Olympic team, the club is over. I'll make it. I gave it up, I can take it back. Teach me 207B. Coach! Keep your head up. It's important. Then bend forward. Keep it up! Stretch your arms. That's right. Once again. BEIJlNG OLYMPIC TRIALS Mom, Dad! Tomo! How are you feeling? Miu and Hiro are here. Shut up! It's OK. Tell them that I'll nail the 4.5 turns jump and will go to the Olympics. I can't go back yet. Shibuki. You must win. Of course. - The start list? - It's in the office. Coach! I promise I'll make it. The Olympic Trials are about to start. Only a winner with a score of over 500 points will qualify. Such a score can secure a medal at the Olympics. That's right. Mr. Kenichiro Teramoto is also here today. Eight divers will compete in the finals. Tomoki Sakai, a junior high student tops the ranking. On his heels is his teammate, Yoichi Fujitani. Who should we support? All three of them. You're right. Hey! Ryo! Sit here. Long time! So you came! And so it begins! Well? He's good. The three divers of MDC lead the ranking. Sakai is third, Fujitani is second, and Okitsu is first. Use this. A spasm? I'm fine. It's the pressure. I'm telling you I'm fine. Let's see what we can do. Stretch it. Relax. The first half is over. Okitsu leads the ranking. Only the top 3 divers stand a chance to get more than 500 points. Chairman. Well, hello. I didn't expect you to let Yoichi Fujitani compete today. When your grandfather and I competed, opposing the Federation was unheard of. We did as told. Eager and devoted. But we won no medals. Maybe those boys... I haven't lost hope. But I won't compromise. 500 points. Not a point less. Alright! Good! Very well. Fujitani will aim for the top with a difficult forward dive. Fujitani? He has fever. He felt responsible and practiced till late last night. I should have noticed. He was close. A careless dive. Not good. He messed up. It's the pressure. Exactly. Next is Sakai, third in the ranking, but... Something's wrong. He isn't on the platform. What happened? What is he doing? What happened? Why? Why? Is he OK? What happened? Can you dive? I'm fine. Tomo! Go! Next, Sakai. 305C, DD 2.7. With this splendid dive, Sakai still has a chance to win. The sixth dive. It's the last one. Shibuki. Free dive. 101A. DD 1.6. Shibuki Okitsu. He has reduced the level. A simple forward dive. Swan dive. The swan dive was his grandfather's specialty. But with such a low level, he needs top marks to get more than 500 points. The dive has to be perfect. Watch me, Grandpa! 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10. Score:. 48.00. Total score:. 500.05. He did it! 500.05 points! The swan dive brought him the first 10 mark so far. Shibuki, you're just like your grandfather. Next is Yoichi Fujitani. Current score 402.85. He will perform a 3.5 turn back dive. 207B, DD 3.6. Yoichi Fujitani. What's wrong? Are you OK? Yes. Something is wrong. He must dive now, or he'll be withdrawn. I can't watch it. It's not good. He'll get no points. Oh, no. Quiet please! My son will dive. Score:. 97.20 points. He did it! Fujitani too broke the 500 point mark. It's a draw. They both made the cut to join the Olympic team. Are you OK? Thank you... Dad. Yoichi... And last, Tomoki Sakai, with a higher level for his final dive. A 4.5 turn jump. Few are the divers who can perform this jump. It's a real challenge. Can this young talent realize his dream? Tomoki Sakai, 109C, DD 3.5. Look at it. The view that only you can see. I can break the limits! Dive! Overcome! Reach! I saw it!
