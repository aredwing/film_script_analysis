Are you insane? - I'm not insane, you are! We've been together for five years... ...but you still can't be on time for a date. I was waiting at King's Cross for the past one hour, Luv. Grow up! Look, what's the big deal? Everyone's got some weakness or the other. My weakness is that I'm a little lax when it comes to matters of time... ...so what's the big deal? Screw you. What's the big deal? You can't bloody wash the dishes after you eat. You can't keep your side of the bed tidy. You can't empty out the ashtray into the dustbin. You bloody dirty pig! You know, Luv. Mum was always right. You will never understand me. I changed for you. I've become a proper Indian girl. Even the way I dress. I've even learnt how to make rice and beans, just for you. Hey, thanks a lot! But I don't want all this. I don't like traditionally dressed Indian girls. Why can't you understand this? Listen... when we first met... ...you had this spark in you. You were charming, you were wild... ...you were open about things. You had this really good energy. But now... ...now you've become a British cow! And rice and beans? David on Oxford Street makes better rice and beans than you. Mum's right. Indian guys like you only come to London for money. Not love. You Indians have no respect for anything. You are classless and cheap. Cheap? Hey coconut! If I continue to be with you, I'll need to pop a few pills of Disprin everyday! Do you think if you're born in Britain, you're automatically British? You know what you actually are. You're a British Born Confused Desi... ...a 'BBCD.' Enough okay. That's it! Enough! I just can't take it. It's finished. Over. Means? Means. BREAKUP! Fine... ...breakup. Mum was right. You are classless and cheap. You and your mum can go to hell, Reshmaben Patel from Surat... ...come here with high hopes to become a Brit. You are a dog, Luv! Still better than being a Gujju Patel from London! Bye! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Breakup? Breakup. That was John who just arrived at the success party of 'lshq Kamina'. Today was the first day of the film's release... ...and producers declared it a hit based on just the Friday collections. If there's any truth behind this celebration... ...we'll only get to know at the box office report in a week from now. For SEE NEWS. Oh damn! Sorry, sorry madam. You aren't hurt I hope? You're live on air. What! You're live on air. Oh, okay! Sorry. Get out of here. - Oh, okay. Sorry. Let's take one more. Sir, it's a private party tonight. You can't go in. We're guests for that very party. Check the guest list. Akash Chopra, Raghav Dhawan and Kush. Just Kush. Assistant directors of Ishq Kamina! Okay sir. You may go in. Guys, we're going to drink like dogs tonight! Attack! Hi! - How are you doing, Kush? Sorry? How you doing, baby? - Good, good. Hey, I think you're ready now. Ready for? Ready to direct your movie! Hey, the thing is my phone's ringing. One second. Sir, excuse me. Hello Bhaisahab (Elder brother). Hello Kush, where are you? What's all that noise in the back? I'm at a party. Hold on. I'll step outside. You are always partying. Bhaisahab, my film is a hit. It's a success party for that. Oh, so it's a hit. Good, good. Listen, when are you going home? I'm leaving on Tuesday. Is everything alright? You know Piali, don't you? - Not at all! You're finding this funny? She's actually gone this time. I broke up with her. Again? - Again! No, this time it's serious. She is mad. She says guys like me come to London only to make money... ...but deep down inside will always remain classless, cheap. You think I'm cheap? Bhaisahab, relax. When did this happen? Some 15 minutes back. It's okay. It happens. Have fun for a few days now. No, enough is enough. It's time now. Time for what? Time to get married. What? Bhaisahab. Marriage? It's not some game. I know. But I am very sure. I just want to get married. But where's the girl? That's the reason why I've called you. Means? Look, you know that when it comes to women... ...my track record has been a disaster. I'm always barking up the wrong tree. And I have made up my mind. I don't want to marry a girl from London. That's why there's ajob for you. What? - Look, Kush. I am a little emotionally broken because of the breakup. And to be very honest. It gets a little lonely here. Enough. I've had enough of this bachelorhood. I want to settle down. I want to have a family. I was thinking I would get married this year to Piali. But even that's not going to happen anymore. I understand. Do one thing. Go to mum and dad. And find a nice girl for me with them. Look, they're old school people... ...but you and I are alike. We both loved Madhuri Dixit as kids, remember? I'm absolutely certain, that the girl you like... ...I would like for sure. This Christmas, I want to be a married man. Oh, Bhaisahab, hold on to your horses! Girls don't just grow on trees. Okay. Don't worry. I'll do something, okay? I love my brother! Love you, brother! What happened? Who called? It was Bhaisahab. Tell me. What kind of name is 'Bhaisahab'? My name is Police Kush. What is yours? My name? My name is, Bhaisahab! A girl for Bhaisahab! It's a big responsibility, man. He's trusted me. I have to do it. I will find her... ...my brother's bride. My brother's bride My brother's bride Matrimonial eyes Searches around Matrimonial eyes Searches for pretty faces Matrimonial eyes Searches around Matrimonial eyes Searches for pretty faces Matrimonial eyes The one who is beautiful and ideal The one whose skin sparkles like silver The one who has attitude and brains The one who is pure at heart And has the world in her pocket The one who commits and submits to the man she loves The one who has Delhi in her heart and London in her heartbeat I seek such a bride for my brother The one who has Delhi in her heart and London in her heartbeat I seek such a bride for my brother Matrimonial eyes Searches around Matrimonial eyes Searches for pretty faces Matrimonial eyes Searches around Matrimonial eyes Searches for pretty faces My brother's bride My brother's bride The one who is a search engine of love And can answer every question in the world With a click of her beautiful eyelashes The one who creates music with her walk And is like a dream to my brother Oh my God, she's a pure prayer A supermodel with an Indian soul I seek such a bride for my brother The one who has Delhi in her heart and London in her heartbeat I seek such a bride for my brother Matrimonial eyes Searches around Matrimonial eyes Searches for pretty faces Matrimonial eyes Searches around Matrimonial eyes Searches for pretty faces My brother's bride My brother's bride Oh Gorgeous The one who is as quick as the light And is yet as tender as a dew drop The one who understands relations And has a spotless heart The one who is a good luck charm This search is a responsibility and is still fun I seek such a bride for my brother The one who has Delhi in her heart and London in her heartbeat I seek such a bride for my brother My brother's bride My brother's bride Will be number one My brother's bride Why don't you become My brother's bride Will be number one My brother's bride Why don't you become My brother's bride My brother's bride My brother's bride Your film is a blockbuster! I can't tell you how proud I was to read your name on the big screen. It was amazing! Why all this drama? This isn't drama, it's a celebration. Full filmy style. Have you gone mad? The cops have come. Let's get out of here! Stop this nonsense! Is it a minister's reception? Making all this noise! So this is why you've come to Dehradun. Hey, it's only a girl. We'll find one. Relax. Listen, call me later. Alright? And yes, say my 'hi' to uncle! Kush. Hello. Welcome. Hi Dinesh. How are you? - I'm good. My child is here! You look so weak. The same line again. Look, you are the mother of a soon to be great Bollywood director. Please, come up with some better dialogue. How many men? That's dad's line. Where is the Colonel? - He's waiting for you. Let's go. Are you going to speak or should I? Yes dad? Listen. The poor boy's just arrived. Hmmmmm! You know, Kush... I'm sick of you and your generation. Your generation, it's the... ...SMS generation. Totally confused. Look at Luv. All these years he'd been saying... ...that he would marry a girl from London. But yesterday, he calls and says No! I will marry an Indian girl. And that I shouldn't select any girl. It's Kush who will do that... ...because he understands me better. Great then. Go find. Kush, don't worry. Dad has arranged to see some girls. We'll go and meet them. When? Tomorrow! Very tasty! My 22-year-old Mani made it herself. How many pounds does your brother earn? I guess about 80 thousand. How much is that in Indian rupees? What do you do? I do stitching. I can sew everything. Really. How nice. Don't worry, son. My whole snack factory is in her name. I shall give you in dowry. My girl studied in a Delhi College. We've brought her up with a lot of love and pride. Hello. So you work in films? Yes. I've heard that Amitabh Bachchan is about seven and half feet tall. Is he? Sir, actually... Does he have a car? He has the company's car. Once during her childhood, a boy broke my girl's doll. Oh no! And these two brothers broke his ribs. So sweet. Will you... cast me as a heroine? One audition? What is your size? Small. Small? No I mean... ...38... ...40. Shall I stitch? - What? Shirt. No, No. Thank you. Coat? - No. Raincoat? - Raincoat! Dollar... money... Your wedding clothes... Ours. Tell me that you love me. - Drink milk! I am going to be the mother of your child. Drink milk. Milk! Mani-honey... ...they have money! What's happening to people? How can they be so dumb? Hey, Mr. Bollywood. You've made 4-5 films and you've lost track of reality. This is how it is in real life. Middle class people talk about these things... ...and ask these kinds of questions only. So what do I do? Should I tell my brother then? We aren't getting a girl. There must be some device with which we can find that one girl... ...who will adjust nicely with my brother in London. I've got an idea. Awesome. Isn't it a poster of a hit film? Hello. - Hello. Is that Mr. Agnihotri? Yes. This is Rakhi Sawant speaking... ...from Rakhi ka Swayamwar 2. - What? I saw the ad for Luv. He's quite cute. Send him to my show. No-No-No... - Hello. What happened? I don't know. This should be it. Hello? Kush Agnihotri? Yes. - Is that party from London there? Yes, that's right. At least the idea was good. My foot, it was good! This house has become a call centre with so many calls! Don't laugh, you ass. There's not much time left before Christmas. If the alliance isn't confirmed in the next 10-15 days... ...then Bhaisahab and my father will kill me. There's a call for you. Who is it? I couldn't understand... They said someone from the ministry. From the ministry? Hello. Kush Agnihotri? Yes sir. My name is Dilip Dixit. I am in the Foreign Services, posted in Delhi right now. Yes sir. I've called you because we saw your matrimonial ad... ...and we have a daughter and we are looking for a suitable boy for her. If it's alright, I'd like to call you and your family over to our house. Yes, sir. Whenever you are free, we can come. Would this Sunday be okay? Absolutely, sir. Absolutely. Great, my secretary will call you to give you the address. Nice talking to you, sir. Same here, son. God bless. Hey, what happened? Yes! Finally a good proposal. See, the idea was good. Kush? - Yes, sir. Nice to see you. - Hello. This is my mother. Hello. - Hello. Hope you had no problem finding the house? - Not at all. Please come, I'll introduce you to everyone. My wife Rita. - Hello. My nieces, Dia and Tina. Hello. - Hello. And this is my genius son, Ajay. M.A. In Psychology. - Really! Hello, hello. Nice to meet you. Really nice. Come in, come in. Please come. So Luv has been in London for 8 years? - Yes. Does he intend to settle there? I don't think he will be able to adjust to the lifestyle here now. He likes London, he's excelling in his job. I think its best for him. Marriage. He'll come to India for the wedding, right? Ajju! Of course he'll come, son. Anyway, he's right. If he likes London then he should stay there. In fact, we like London a lot. We were there for 18 years - Really? I was the Cultural Secretary there... ...and our daughter Dimple was born there. This is the main reason we wanted to meet with you. When we saw that ad of yours, we were quite excited. And Kush, I must say... ...very well done on the ad. Thank you, uncle! Dimple's taking a long time. Dimple! So where does Luv stay in London? He stays in Wembley. Hi aunty. - Hello, dear. I'm sure you know the famous stadium there. Tea? - Yes, thank you. Oh no! - What have you done? He spilled everything. Son, go inside and wash this. Dear, show him the bathroom. - Yes. Please sit. It happens sometimes. - Sorry. What are you doing here? What the... what are you doing here? Hello. Hey, where are you, D? Listen, I've put sugar in the tank. Once the bus goes a little further, the engine will seize. And you can come and pick us up. Okay? You are too good. I know. I'm the best. Hey look, it's bus! Help us! Help us! Stop! Robin! Hey D! - What's up? Hey guys, this is D. Hi, D! D, these are the guys. Hi guys! Hi, D! Soft drinks? Are you serious? School's over, this is college. I love you, D! Hey, Don't you dare say that again. I'll break your teeth. But I like hearing it. So this one's for you. And you're kinda cute, so that's for you. Cutie! Last one? Me! Me! This one is for him. 'Coz he's kinda different. Have fun, guys! Kush... Yo. Where did you find this high fashion wildcat? I met her at a rave party last Saturday in Chattarpur farms. I see. She was born and brought up in London. She shifted here a year back. I guess, she's studying some History Honours from LSR. Nice. You seem quite curious. Should I introduce you? No, she's not my type. The further I stay away from her the better. What are you guys doing sitting in the corner? It's time to fly! Oh my free spirited heart Oh my free spirited heart Love breaks all shackles And my bohemian soul dances to glory I have lost everything and gained love Peace is what it desires Break the walls Shout out loud Breathe love, feel love, live love It's a spell of love (Spellbound) It's a spell of love (Spellbound) It's a spell of love (Spellbound) It's a spell of love (Spellbound) Oh my free spirited heart Such is the magic of love that it makes you vulnerable (like a child) Find the love within you Why do you go wandering in the world when everything exists within you Find yourself Break the walls Shout out loud! Breathe love, feel love, live love It's a spell of love (Spellbound) It's a spell of love (Spellbound) It's a spell of love (Spellbound) It's a spell of love (Spellbound) Breaking News. Dimple Dixit, alias D... ...a student of Delhi University, has illegally... ...held a rock concert in Agra Fort... ...because of which huge crowds have gathered... ...and the Superintendent of Police has given orders to restrain her. You are the wind, the water, the fire You are the right, you are the wrong You can be what you want to be My heart feels the purity of God, who exists within me You look within, you find him Break the walls Shout out loud! Breathe love, feel love, live love It's a spell of love (Spellbound) It's a spell of love (Spellbound) It's a spell of love (Spellbound) It's a spell of love (Spellbound) It's a spell of love (Spellbound) Oh my free spirited heart Oh my free spirited heart What's wrong with you, Dimple! Just get off me! - Why are you hitting me! Robin, get off me! Get out of here! You crazy, stupid girl! You , I'll kill you! How dare you touch me! Oh damn. Who do you think you are? I'll kill you! Hey, D! Just because I am friendly with you doesn't mean... ...I will sleep with you, okay? I'll sort you out. Just come to college! - Come here. Let go of me! Are you okay? I'm fine. You think I'm a bitch? A tart? I'm sorry? No, you must be thinking I am a slut. You know what the problem with this country is that here If a guy flirts with not one, but even three or four girls at a time... ...then it's fine, he's a stud. He's a hero. But if it's a girl... ...like me friendly, open, carefree... ...then people think she will sleep with just anybody. Such narrow mindedness. I feel stifled here. D, this not London, this is India. Every country has its way of thinking, a culture. Most girls here aren't open, carefree, friendly like you. They are shy and obedient. And they behave a certain way. This doesnt mean that you are wrong. You're right in your own way. A girl has every right to have fun but... ...in a country like this if you behave that way... ...then you are likely to find boys like Robin at every crossroads... ...who looks at every girl in a miniskirt and thinks they can get them. So you think I should change? No. Not at all. You are perfect the way you are. The best thing about you is that you are so childlike... ...and pure that you do not see the filth around you. This madness of yours is your USP. Don't ever lose it. And about what people think. I think that will change with time. But it will take a little longer. Cheers. Cheers. It's gone cold. Will you have tea with me? Some other time. For sure. Kush. Thank you. You're welcome. Stop it. It's done. So soon? Very funny. What's with you? You've changed. I can't believe you're opting for an arranged marriage. Listen, everything changes with time. Whatever craziness I wanted to do in life, I am done with that. And my parents never stopped me. I use to party like mad, go on trips... ...for days I would stay out, they never asked me a single question. And I never broke their trust. I did what I wanted to do but I never crossed the line. Now I'm 27 years old, single. And you know when a girl passes 25 in this country... ...people around start talking nonsense. So they asked me to get married and I said yes. I think I owe that much to them. And I was only born in London, I'm still an Indian at heart. You really are a deep girl Dimple. I'm impressed. Either way I feel... ...an arranged marriage will be a different kind of adventure. And all your boyfriends? I broke up with them. They were all bloody dumb. That's another reason why I decided. I will marry a rich sorted out package. Package? What else? Your brother is a package only. He is good-looking. I am correctly beautiful and appropriately sexy. Yes. Definitely. I've been brought up in London. I've got an accent as well. He stays in London. I will fit in there very nicely. He earns a lot, in pounds. I'll spend it. And think about it. Our glowing and chubby kids will call you uncle with an accent. Isn't that a great package? Shut up, Dimple! What shut up? Don't judge me! Didn't your brother have any girlfriends or what? He did, actually he just broke up with a girl. See! I'm not judging him. So why are you? And who are you? That's a great dialogue. You should be in films. Thank you. Come, let's go outside. Or people will think we are up to something. There they are. What's the matter, dear? You took so long? Yes, it went deep down. That's why. It looks like he pissed in his pants. Dear. - Yes, dad? Take Kush inside show him around. Okay. Come. Pull it out! Pull what out? What? Nothing. Say what? Dimple will you marry my brother? I've never met a girl as honest as you in my life. A little crazy, different from the usual girls... ...but there is something about you. My brother said he'll marry a girl that I like. And I like you. Very much. I know. I'm the best. She'll never change. Please come in. Mr. Dixit! - Colonel! Colonel, Sir our daughter Dimple. Hello, my dear. Hello, Bhaisahab. Can you hear me? Yes, yes, I can hear you. Can you see me clearly? Mr. Dixit's family is here, they want to talk to you. Good bring them here. Call them, call them. Please come. Hello dear. - Hello. How are you? - I'm good. How are you? Why are you wearing a sweater? Are you alright? It's a bit chilly in London... ...so I thought I should wear a sweater. Shouldn't fall sick. So, son, tell us. How's your work coming along? Oh work it's going great. Market is going great. Absolutely fantastic. Work will keep happening. Dad, can I talk to him? Sure. Of course. Ajju. Come, son. Come. Dad, please could you step outside? I want to speak to him alone. Of course. Hi. Hi. Will you start or should I? As in? I mean, will you ask me a question first or should I? I don't really have any questions... ...but if you do then I would love to answer them. Good. You have 30 seconds and this is a rapid fire round. Ready? Ready. Which is better, UK or India? India. Rice and beans or pizza? Rice and beans. Who is sexier? Shakira or Beyonce? I would say. Beyonce. Aamir Khan in Ghajini or Shahrukh Khan in Om Shanti Om? Salman Khan. Shirt or T-shirt? T-shirt. Pants orjeans? Jeans. Underwear or no underwear? Time's up. You're saved. Next time please be ready with the answer. Do you have anything you want to ask? Nice to meet you. Bye. Bhaisahab, what do you think of her? Oh, she's too good. I have never met a girl like her before. So spunky! She interviewed me like Coffee with Karan in the very first meeting. What? - You won't understand. Should I confirm things or not? One hundred percent. Confirmed! Kush. Thank you. You're welcome, Bhaisaaab. So dear, what do you think? Do you like him? Yes. Oh my God! I'm so happy! Mom! Dimple. These are my childhood friends... ...Rohit and Shobit. Warm regards! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law? Me? Just call me Dimple. Dimple! - Dimple. She's quite frank. Isn't she? Kush, come here. Excuse me. Colonel, I have a small request. Yes, yes. Please tell me. We would love to hold the wedding in Delhi. I would request all of you to come there for 10 days. We'll book a big guesthouse. Both families will stay together and make all the arrangements. I think that's a brilliant idea, Mr. Dixit. You book the guesthouse and let us know. We'll be there with music and drums. Cheers to that! Hello. - Hi! LSR College? No, No. Miranda House. Have chickpeas. - Sweets. Chickpeas? It's really good. Look the one in purple is mine. I'm the one wearing purple, she's mine! She's your sister then. Just what are you guys doing? We ordered five cylinders just three days ago. Fine, we'll talk later. What's up, Shobit? Everything's under control? A brand new problem plagues the market. Will our Bhaisahab ride a horse or a mare? Are you kidding me? Look, there's a budget for everything. The horse is four thousand per hour and the mare is eight thousand. Now it's Bhaisahab's decision what he'd like to ride on. Take a look at the card, Sir, It's like a diamond shaped sweet. I can't understand anything. - It will be a sensation. You called for me. Son, we've looked at a few card samples and we don't like anything. Kush, this is Govind. His shop is at Chaavri bazaar. You go with Dimple and select a design that you like. Yes, definitely. - That's not a bad idea. I think I should select my own wedding card. Certainly. And if you're free then we could go now. Why not? - Yes, let's go. Bye dad. - Bye sweetheart. Bye mom. - Bye dear. You go ahead, we'll follow you in our car. Car! Sir, where will a car fit there? Let's do one thing. You sit behind me. We'll all adjust. Let's go triples. What is it? Don't do that! Hey, it's just a scooter. - Don't move! C'mon, make way. Exactly what you are looking for. Let's finalize a card. Super! Too good. Excellent choice. - Excuse me. Kush! Don't fall. - Don't do that, Dimple! Dimple, I'm riding a scooter for the first time don't do that. First time? I told you not to do that. You hit me! Don't you know how to ride a scooter? Idiot! You don't know how to ride a scooter? Have you gone mad! I've been telling you since this morning sit steady. Don't move so much, this needs to be balanced... ...but you're doing the disco sitting behind! Ah! Now it's my fault you're a bad driver. I am not a bad driver you're a bad sitter. Oh really? Sir, sister-in-law is getting very angry. Don't call me sister-in-law! I am sorry madam. I am sorry. Whatever the damages are, I'll pay for it. No, don't worry sir, I'll manage. You just handle madam. Just pick the scooter and let's go. Do you want to marry him? This isn't some show. Go do your work. Go! Kush, say thank you. Why? Why? See how well I acted. He didn't even ask for any money. You're amazing Dimple, first you endanger my life... ...then you ask me to say thank you. Look Ahead! It's the time to disco. Dimple, please. Kush, don't fall. Don't fall! It was a good day. It was a mad day, Dimple. Cheers everybody! Colonel, sir. Welcome to the family. - Thank you, sir. Kush, when is Luv coming? On Friday. Great. This means that the engagement can take place on Sunday. Okay, dear? Excellent. So on this note once again cheers! Cheers, everybody. Ajju. Check it out, this is damn funny. Look at this. I love Taj. The two of you met there for the first time, right? Taj. Who told you that? Dimple doesn't hide anything from me. Dimple-Ajju. Kush, I have a wish. Tell me. I'm not sure about my wedding, if it will ever happen or not. But I want Dimple's wedding to be held at Agra. At a place from where one can see the Taj. Beautiful white Taj. Dimple. Wedding. Let Luv get here. I will speak to him. I like you. I like you. You're okay? Dimple? I'm feeling weird, Kush. This Sunday I'll be engaged. And in a week... married. So? So I will soon be a married woman. Bound by responsibilities, my whole life will change. I won't have all this freedom. You're such a drama queen. Shut up, Kush. C'mon, my brother is not a circus ringmaster... ...who'll keep you locked inside a cage. That's not the issue. You won't understand. I understand. You're a little nervous. And for good reason. But everything is going to turn out great. I know that but I'll miss this. What I am right now. So what do you want to do? You have 48 hours. Miss Unmarried Dimple Dixit. Kush, before I get engaged I want to live... ...like how I've lived for the past 25 years. Free as a bird. I want to dress how I used to. I want to attend a class in college. I want to eat what I want. I want to get drunk. I want to disappear completely into this world. Do everything and I mean everything. We'll live it up. The next 48 hours like never before.

Just shut up. You are drunk. I am not drunk. I am just happy, Kush! Listen Dimple, I need to pick up Bhaisahab from the airport. I'll drop you off at the guest house. Okay? Are you crazy. I can't go to the guest house in this condition, Kush. Okay, so what do you suggest? Should I drop you at a friend's place? No way. I am not going to anyone's house. Okay, so what do we do then, Dimple? What do you mean? I will come with you to pick up Luv. - No, no. Kush, I'm getting married to him. It's my right to pick him up. In this state? - Ya! You're going to get me in trouble. Okay. Do one thing. Stop at a dairy and get half a kilo of curd. Because with curd, the buzz goes a little, fine? C'mon Kush. C'mon. - Really? C'mon. Take a left. Dimple, one second. Dimple-Dimple. You've made a mess of it now. Hold on for a second. Curd. Give me some curd. Relax. Who eats curd like this? - I do! Give it to me quickly, Kush! See, much better. Better. C'mon, you're fine now. Look, don't say anything stupid in front of Bhaisahab. Hey, Kush! I know how to control myself. Alright? Don't teach me, okay! He'll never change. Hey, Bhaisahab! Kush! My brother! How are you? Great. You tell me. Are you ready? Ready and how. What a nice girl you've found for me. Dimple! What a beautiful name! After I had that l-chat with her... ...I haven't once thought about Piali. Damn good, Bhaisahab. How's dad? You know dad. - Oh damn! Kush? Bhaisahab, she's come to pick you up. Dimple. Dimple. Dimple. Meet my Bhaisahab, Luv. Hello. Nice to meet you in person. Nice to meet you too. Are you alright? Me, yeah! It was my best friend's birthday party so I drank a little too much. You don't have any problem with drinking? Drinking? No, I love drinking. Great. Kush, shall I? What? - Drive. Yes. Yes. So how are you feeling? What do you mean? Meaning, in 'Swades' when Shahrukh Khan comes to India... ...he starts hearing music in his ears. The cows on the road. Indian population, colours all around. He starts loving all this. Are you feeling the same? Not really. No? Then why do they show it like that in films? Kush, why do you make such films? Hey, Kush. I'll show you what films are... ...what dialogues are and what acting is. C'mon Kush. Call action. Action? - Just say action. Action! Thank you. Suicide! Suicide! People. You see this Basanti. Basanti. I was about to get married to her. But this old hag of an aunt sitting behind messed it up for me. Old hag aunt. Now it's impossible for me to stay alive. People. I bid my final adieu. Goodbye! Goodbye! Everyone is asleep. Goodnite. Kush, Luv. Luv, Kush. Goodnight. Old aunty? Bhaisahab... ...she's nothing like that. However she is... ...she's good. I like her. Well done. Oh bad omen, may you be shamed. From the left, right and centre. Enough granny, you've shamed the omen completely! Go son. Meet him. Good morning, dad. Has the bad spell been cast off? - Yes. You've finally had enough of London girls? Yes, yes, yes. You'll marry for sure or... My dear Colonel. Oh, Mr. Dixit. Come, come. You've completely forgotten us after your son came. How are you, sir? I'm good, I'm good. You tell me, how are you feeling? I am feeling a bit weird... ...everything's happened so quickly, I didn't even realize. I still can't believe it. You should thank Kush. He's done everything. I will, Ajju. I will. Hello dear, have you met him? Yes. We had a short meeting last night. A short meeting at night! Ajju, that's enough. Dad, we have to go and collect those wedding cards. Oh yes. Colonel, don't we have a lot of work? Definitely. Yes. C'mon. Let's leave. Will you come along? Certainly. Kush! We need to go to Chaavari bazaar... ...to collect that wedding card? Why don't you do one thing? You go with Bhaisahab. I have some work. Kush, just come. Come. Come with us. No, I have some urgent work. Okay.

Ya sure, go ahead, talk in private. Something is wrong, Kush. - What happened? I don't now, I just can't understand it. But there is something wrong. I spent the whole day with Luv. He is the man I am getting married to. I should've been excited. The whole day I was missing something. I don't know but it's weird. How was your day? Totally rocking. Really? - Really. Dimple you're over-analyzing and that's why you are confused. My brother will... will keep you very happy. Promise. I promise. I hope you're right. It can make life difficult It can make you do anything It can change your being This boundless love Takes you on ajourney through fantasy It can make life difficult It can make you do anything It can change your being This boundless love Takes you on ajourney through fantasy No one ahead or before It races on regardless My heart's been struck by love lts in you, its in me lts in our fables Make me learn it without learning it. Oh God That's how love is It's risky That's how love is It's risky You love her, don't you? Have you gone mad? Just shut up. Mr. English, listen. Drop it. I've been your friend since childhood. In seventh grade, when you proposed to a girl for the first time... ...lt was me who got you that huge card that read... ...'I miss you too.' Shobit. You're a kid. What's with the sudden burst of love for your friend? I think today you both should speak in private. What's wrong, Kush? Dimple, I'm very confused. Dimple. Dimple, I've been having this weird feeling since yesterday. I'm thinking about you all the time. That day when you were with Bhaisahab. I missed you. I missed you a lot. I know it sounds weird. But it's happened for the first time to me. Complicated. Everything is getting complicated. I guess what I'm trying to say is... is... is that. Tell me, Kush. I love you, Dimple. Damn it! When I told you yesterday that I was missing something... ...you couldn't understand then I was missing you! What's my fault in this? I didn't think and fall in love... it just happened. Stupid, see this. What are we going to do about this? I don't know! I just wanted to tell you that I love you... ...what to do about it. I have no idea. - Shut up, Kush, just shut up! You are confused. I was confused. Let me think. - Yeah, think. There's only one way out. We'll have to run away. Today itself. Before anyone suspects us. Run away? - Yes. Have you gone mad? This isn't some film. Run away. And what will people say. Kush ran away with his soon to be sister-in-law. Kush, so you will spend all your life knowing... ...that you love your sister-in-law? But Dimple, we can't do that. Whatever you needed to do you're done with it. From now on I'll do everything. Alright? We're going to run away. That's final. Dimple! Tonight at 12. You spilled everything! Dimple, listen. Look what you've done. You had to fall in love with your own brother's bride. Kush! Coming, Bhaisahab! Oh damn! Dimple, what are you doing? Where did you get the gun? I stole it from the guard. - Why? Because if you don't run away with me, I'll shoot you. Dimple! The gun will go off. We are running away. I'm not running away. You have to. - I won't. You have to. Dimple, shoot me if you have to, but I'm not going anywhere. She makes me fall off the scooter, she slaps me, threatens me with a gun. Is this a girl or a Bandit Queen? I can't take any more of this. Can't believe what I've gotten myself into. What? Okay, we won't run. Sorry. Now don't get upset. Goodnight. Sleep well. Return that gun. Kush... ...you are such a wuss. Granny... ...you're roaming around so late at night. Go to sleep. Oh Heck. Excuse me. Wake up quickly. What happened, madam? He's really unwell. We need to go to a hospital. Please hurry. - Okay, let's hurry. Remove your glasses at least. How will you see? Don't worry about these. These glasses have power. Sit quickly. Where do you want to go? Just drop us at the highway. I'll manage from there. Please hurry. Kush! Kush! Oh Shit. Kush! Where are we? What's happening? On the highway. What are we doing here? You idiot! Don't you remember? We've run away! Run away? When did we run away? Shit! Oh shit! Dimple! Dimple, what have you done! What's wrong with you! Shit! Shit! What other option did we have? I love you. Why are you crying? I was scared that you died off an overdose. Dimple, please try and understand. We can't run away. But why? Because I'm not Aamir Khan... ...and you're not Juhi Chawla from Qayamat se Qayamat Tak. What were you thinking? We'd climb a mountain and make a house there? And I'll work in a factory and you'll bring lunch for me tied in a cloth? Shut up, Kush! Dimple... ...I love you. But please try and understand. We're middle class people, we've grown up with middle class values. No matter how progressive we become... ...some things will never change in this country. I can't live my entire life away from my parents and brother. And I'll become ajoke for the whole society, right? A brother ran away with his brother's to be bride! And just think about your family. Will you be able to live away from your dad, mom and Ajju? And the shame that you'll bring to their name. What about that? So what should I do? Fine, I'll marry your brother! Okay! Let's not complicate anything. Hey listen. Listen. We are in love, right? You are going to get married to me. But Dimple, the situation is very complicated. You are my brother's fiance. How are we going to solve this problem? I'll have to rack my brains. Rack something you have. How do we go back home? I've got an idea. You look great. C'mon. What happened? Why are you pulling down everything? The programme got cancelled, Sir. Cancelled? Who said so? Your father. Who else? Damn. Rakesh, there's a thief somewhere here. He took my wheelchair. You don't worry. Hey, Dimple's here. Where's your phone? I've been calling you since this morning. I forgot to take it in all that hurry. - You come outside. I want to speak to you in private. Why didn't you tell me? Bhaisahab, everything happened so fast. I just didn't get the time. Fast! Do you know what drama happened because of you? Sorry. - Sorry my ! He's been crying away since this morning. Crying? Ajju! Ajju told you that he wanted... ...Dimple's wedding to take place in Agra... ...from a place where you can see the Taj. Did or did he not tell you this? I forgot. - You forgot! How can you forget such a romantic sweet cute thought? How could you, you should have told me at least. Now what? - Now what! The wedding will happen in Agra. Luv, do you want to go to Agra or not? Almost. We'll leave in 15 minutes. Everything under control? Of course. I'm a Complan boy. Everything is good. Give me a break. You've told him too? What did I tell him? He already knew it. It's written all over your face that you love her. Got it? What will you do now? We'll have to think of something. How much beer do you have with you? Please get down. The bus will halt here for an hour. You get everything here, from cold drinks to Complan. Yes Ma'am. Yes Madam. Yes Miss. Fantastic. Salman Bhai, where is the bathroom? Right for Gents. Left for Ladies. Feel relaxed. Got it, right? - Yes. Let's have a showdown! I'll cut yours. Yeah? Show me! Come on. Bring it on. Easy guys! You're spilling all over! What's this Bhaisahab? We're really bored. It's supposed to feel like a wedding, feels like a drought. What do you want? Let's have a couple of beers. That will cool us down. No way. We're with family. It won't look nice. C'mon. So then let's have some of that. - That? Bhaisahab, you're in UP... ...but if you haven't tasted the bhaang (Opium) here... ...then you haven't experienced the real UP. - Bhaang! It's on the terrace. Licensed. You come to UP and don't taste the bhaang. It's a shame. What's going on? - Nothing much. Bhaisahab's having a little bhang. Bhaang! Even I want to have some bhaang. Dimple, you can't have bhaang. Oh, I see. Fine. Then you can have my share too. Your share. My share. Wonderful, Bhaisahab. I'll have your share too. Wow. Now that's something. You'll have one more. Give me. It's healthy. Last one. Five! He's the bhaang boy. Madhubala! I spin, ripples form in my head My heart collides with yours I am lost, or is it you?

Of course I'm ready. I'm Eveready. Dimple, what a girl she is! I'm besotted, completely bowled over by her attitude! So you're finally over Piali? Piali? Piali who? I don't know any Piali. I only know... ...Dimple. C'mon, Bhaisahab. I'm sure you miss her sometimes? Piali... Piali... Piali... I miss her a lot even now. We were in a relationship for 5 whole years. Somewhere deep down I still have feelings for her. Bhaisahab, that's amazing, Bhaisahab, really deep. Don't ask, Shobit. We were this close to getting married. We'd even found a school in London for our future kids, last Valentine. You know what, I really think we were made for each other. I truly loved her. Sorry, I get a little too emotional when I drink. Don't worry, Bhaisahab, even I carried away. Bhaisahab. Do you still love her? No way! Everything's over now. So even Pia must have gotten over you then. Gotten over? She still loves me. Ever since I broke up with her... ...she's called and texted every single day. I love you, I miss you, come back to me baby. Look I just received a text from her. See. Her text. Kush? The least you can do is have a bath. I can still smell the beer. Yeah, it is pretty bad. Have you seen Dimple around? Oh crap. Hello. Ajju. Good morning. Good morning. Kush, Even Ajju is with us. Meaning? Meaning... Dimple doesn't hide anything from me. Come on guys! What the hell is going on? Are you sure this idea is going to work? You've managed to weave a filmy story into real life. If Bhaisahab finds out, we're done for. Nothing will happen. Just make sure that no one other than us gets to know about this. Okay, Ajju? Promise. - Good. So you are going to make the first move. Okay! I just love eating hot puri's in the morning... You're very different from Kush. Really. How so? The way you had bhaang and danced yesterday. I was quite impressed. You have a spark. Thank you. And see how boring your brother is. Oh him, he's always been like that. I was always, the wild one. Hey, what are you doing? Oh, Ajju. Is this your phone? Yes. This is my phone. Do you have games on it? Yes. There are. There are a lot of games on it. Can I play? Of course you can. Too sweet. - C'mon, anything for Ajju. Come bhaisahab, let's go. - Where?

When I read your SMS on Luv's phone... ...and I came to my senses. Means? Means he loves you damn it! But he told me that he didn't love me anymore. Oh, but he does. He just doesn't want to admit it. I don't believe it. - Oh? Well, you will soon. See this. Piali. I still think of her a lot. We were together for 5 years. We were this close to getting married. You know what, I really think that we were made for each other. I truly loved her. Look what he's done to himself. How could I possibly marry someone... ...who still loves you so much? Why don't you call off the marriage? Oh, Piali. This is India, Piali. If you call off an engagement after marriage... ...then whatever be the reason, it will only mean one thing. Humiliation for me and my family. That's why I've called you here. Because you are the only one who can help me. How? Tell me this first, do you still love him? A lot. Do you want to marry him? - Yes. But how? - Control him! Control. How will I control him? He's marrying you. Piali. Don't you know this. Boys are suckers... ...and a sucker only needs a lollipop. Dangle a lollipop to a sucker, he will automatically be in your control. Got it? - Yes. But just remember one thing. You are my childhood friend from London... ...not Piali, just Pia.

You are actually on time for a date for the first time. This isn't time for fun, Piali. What are you doing? What have I done now? - You're flirting with my brother! He's just a kid. He has started liking you. Does your brother wear diapers? No, right? He is not a child. He likes me, so what's wrong in that? - Wrong? What's wrong is that my mother is... ...about to ask for your hand in marriage for him. Really? That's a good thing. Even I'm reaching a marriageable age. Even I want to get settled. And can I tell you something? There are a lot of his mannerisms that remind me of you. I think that's so sweet, Luv. Have you gone mad? This cannot happen! Why not? - Because you're my... I'm your what, Luv? Listen Luv, stop it. Not everything in life can happen according to your convenience. You were the one who broke up with me, not the other way around. And how is it my fault if the girl you are getting married... ...turned out to be a childhood friend of mine... ...and in that wedding your brother ends up liking me. And if you are feeling that bad about it then be a man. Show some courage and call off your wedding with Dimple... ...and marry me. Tell me. Do you have it in you? You know what, Luv. When you have the answer then we'll talk. We're done. C'mon, dear. C'mon, let's go. Luv, you've really done it now. I'll have to think of something. If you ask me, this plan has failed, Kush. The wedding is the day after and up till now. Dimple, just relax. It will take some time. Really, some more time? Do one thing. You sit here relaxing while I'll be over there getting married. Okay? Good plan. Who is it? Who? - It's me, Kush, open the door. I'm just coming, Bhaisahab. In a few seconds. Hurry! Almost there. Coming. On my way. Reached. What were you doing? I've been knocking forever. Oh nothing. Nothing. What happened? Bhaisahab! Kush! I don't know how to say this to you, Kush. Do you know, when I first came to India... ...I was a little confused about marrying Dimple. She was a little too wild for me. But then I realized she's a great girl. And then I wasn't confused anymore. For the first time in my life I was very clear about what I wanted. But then everything went for a toss. Bhaisahab, what happened? I can't go through with this marriage! I cannot marry Dimple! But why? Because of that Pia! The one who you were playing badminton with. She's Piali Patel. My ex-girlfriend from London. What! Oh my God! Why didn't you tell me? Sorry, I wanted to I just couldn't muster up the courage. Ever since she's come it feels like there's... ...a tennis match being played in my mind between her and Dimple. It goes on and on. You know that day when the two of you were playing badminton... ...I felt very jealous. - Sorry, Bhaisahab. I can't do this. What can't you do? - I'm in love with Pia! I'm in love with Pia. Yes! Yes! When I see her face... ...I start seeing the faces of my future children... ...whose names we had enlisted in a university in London. I've been thinking about it since this morning... ...and I've finally decided... ...and this is my final decision. Final. Trust my word... ...that I... ...want to spend... ...the rest of my life with Pia. Save me, Kush, Save me. Do something. - No, no. You make great plans. Do something. You know I've always been like these. Not these, this. - Yes, this. Yes. Okay. Are you sure you love Pia... I mean Piali? You want to marry her? Do one thing, Go to your room. I'll think of something. I really love you brother. Kush. Everything is finally coming together! You've packed everything, right? Yes. Sweater. Jeans. Underwear. Packed everything. Relax, Bhaisahab, everything will be alright? So you guys are running away? Yes. You are really lucky, Piali. Not many boys have the guts to actually run away with a girl. The temple is on Gandhi road. The priest will reach there in half an hour. Okay. Alright. Listen. All this happened... ...because of a stupid breakup between me and Piali. I was confused as always and didn't realize that... ...I wasn't even ready for marriage in the first place because... ...I was in love with someone else. Listen... ...Piali is a great girl. I think you made the right choice. I really love you. I love you too, brother. Bhaisahab. Dear dad. I love you. Dear uncle. I love you too. Dad, Mom and you are the two most important people in my life. But I've made a huge mistake. I cannot marry Dimple... ...because I've fallen in love with Pia. Pia too loves me a lot. So much so that I want to spend the rest of my life with her. This is why Pia and I have run away and got married. The photos are in the envelope. Please try and forgive us. Give us your blessings. Lots of love, Luv. What happened, dad? Oh! Now what? Colonel. Whatever's happened, has happened. Whoever's fault it may be... ...both the families are going to have their names tarnished. What we have to figure out, is how do we get out of this mess? Dixit Sahab, you don't understand. All the guests have arrived. The wedding is tomorrow. Where do I find another Luv? I suggest, get Dimple married to Kush. Dimple weds Kush. Ajju! No, Rita. I think that is a very good idea. Colonel, Ajju's right. We like Kush a lot. If you get him to agree to marriage... ...then we're saved from embarrassment. But will Dimple marry Kush? Look dear. She was your friend. She ran away with Luv. I don't think we're at fault at this. I had asked him. If he'll get married or... He was confused even then. If the guests return this way... ...it will be very humiliating. Everything is in your hands. Kush is a very nice boy. Really. He'll keep you very happy. Please marry her for our sake. They are right, say yes. I want to speak to Dimple. In private. - Yes dear, of course. Yes, of course! Of course! Colonel. Kush wants to talk to Dimple in private. Very good. Dimple would also like to do the same. Good, good. Go ahead son. Come. Shall we sit there till then? - Come, come. Wait. Wait. Just hope they say yes... ...then we'll be out of this mess... ...or else Luv hasn't left us with any options. Mr. Dixit, but my son cannot be blamed entirely for what's happened. What about Pia and what she did? Propose to me. What? - Propose to me. Are you mad? I am not going to do anything proposing. Then forget about marrying me. C'mon, what do you want? That I should go down on my knees and ask... ...Dimple, would you marry me? Don't waste time. Just do it. Really? Pia was just a poor girl. Poor girl! The girls nowadays are more cunning than the boys. They've got 3-4 boys vying for their attention at one time. But colonel... ...Luv must have a loose character for him... ,, to fall into this trap so easily. What did you say? That my son's character is loose! And your daughter's friend Pia. Was she an innocent angel? Tell me. You are the most beautiful girl in the world. You are the most beautiful girl in the world. I will keep you happy forever. I will keep you happy forever. I will never burp in front of you. What? Is this a proposal? I know after marriage when husbands become shameless... ...they burp in front of their wives and I hate it. So get down and say it. I will never burp in front of you. Yes! I will never leave you alone. I will never leave you alone. I will always love you, will never let you cry. I will always love you... ...and I'll never let you cry. I will kiss you every day. I will kiss you every day. Dimple... ...will you marry me? Dixit Sir! What are you saying! Why are you screaming? Talk properly. What do you mean, talk properly? That Pia has trapped my poor son with her games and you're... ...standing here talking all sorts of nonsense. Excuse me, Colonel, but your son wasn't born yesterday... ...that you are putting all the blame on Pia. The manner in which you are defending her... ...we are starting to get doubts about your family! Colonel, listen, don't say anything about my family! Just because I'm listening, does not mean you can go on talking rubbish. What more can I say? Everything is in front of you! You are insulting me. Only if you had some integrity left could I insult you! Dad, cool down! What cool down! The older son has lost it completely. Should I let you spoil your life? NEVER! - Okay! That's enough, Colonel! What's he trying to say? You'll call off the wedding? I call off the wedding right now! Go on then, we don't want to give our girl to such a family. - Dad! Yes, even we don't want to have a marriage in such a house. You go get tickets arranged quickly. Dad, this is very childish. Hey, You keep quiet! Shut up! Enough! What I say, will be done! And that's an order! Draw the fences! - Draw it! And let's get the bloody hell out of here! Let's also get the hell out of here! Wedding cancelled! Hear me? Wedding cancelled! Colonel! Atleast hear me out. Dilip! Here we go again. We're doomed. Kush, get ready to run away. Meaning? - Meaning... ...lf you love Dimple then run away with her. Let's go. Dimple, I cannot run away. Why? Because, once I've made a commitment... ...then even I can't stop myself. Kush. I'll give you one tight slap and all this filminess will disappear! I'm being serious here! It's a question of our entire life! Dimple. Listen. I love you. Please, just listen to me this one last time. If this doesn't work... ...then I'll do, whatever you say. I promise. Last time? Last time. Both father's have had a fight. Fences have been drawn. Both groups have had a big division. Everything is ready? - Fully ready. Okay. Remember only one car should remain after everything. Okay boss. Guys, hurry up! Take it straight to the station. Don't stop for anything. Understood? Anyone left? Come Ajju. Have a seat. Dad, It's the last car. I think everyone else has left. We'll have to go in this. Dad, please sit. We'll miss the train. In this car? Hello. Yes. She's giving birth. Tell her to wait. I'm coming. I'm coming. Kush, I'm very sorry. I won't be able to come with you. Yes, please go. I'll drive. Take care. See you. Come, dad. Uncle. Thanks. You'll be more comfortable in the back. I'll sit in front. So Kush, will you go to Dehradun or straight back to Mumbai? Mumbai. I've been off for quite a few days. And in any case what's there to do in Dehradun? I'll have to listen to people talk nonsense. You don't know what Delhi people are like. With all their taunts, I will land up committing suicide. Forget it, Dimple, its useless talking about it now. You're right, anyway. At least there was one good thing that came out of this. What's that? I found a good friend like you. I will miss you. I will miss you too. Come to Mumbai sometime. We'll meet. I don't know about Mumbai... ...but make sure you send me your wedding card. I'll definitely make it for that. Yes. Of course. What kind of girl will you marry? It's a little hard to explain, but... What but? She has to be exactly like you. I am serious. I'm not kidding, You are a very nice girl, Dimple. And this is not just me, but my entire family, my friends. Everyone loves about the way you laugh, you talk, you dress. Anyone would fall for you. Even you are really nice, Kush. In fact dad says you remind him of Amol Palekar. Amol Palekar? You are so cute. So innocent. I will miss you a lot... ...more than you can imagine. Dimple... ...I want to tell you something. Yes? How do I say this. This isn't the time or place. Just say it, Kush. All we have are these few moments... ...and it's possible we may never meet ever again. No, I can't. I can't. Not in front of Dad and Papa. Kush, for me, just say it. Dimple. I think, I... I think, I... What are you mumbling? Just say it, Kush! Dimple, I lo... Stop the car! Stop the car now. Right now! Look... ...the two of you step out of the car and leave us for two minutes. I need to talk to Mr. Dixit in private. Sure, sure. C'mon. Mr. Dixit. They've got a point. We will really have to face the insult when we go back. Yes, Colonel. And the way these two are talking to each other. I'm afraid they might run away. C'mon, sir. The two of you, please get married. - What? Get married? Yes dear, this is what's best for you. I mean, best for all of us. Best for everybody. What say, Dimple? Okay! Get down on your knees and propose to me. Have you lost it? I'm not doing any proposing. Fine. Then I won't marry you! - Kush! Don't. - What's wrong with you? What's there in proposing? Hurry up. Do it. Be a good boy. - If she wants you to propose, then do it. C'mon hurry up. Dimple, marry me. Marry me. - No. Say, I love you, Dimple. Please will you marry me? What nonsense. Dad, I only agreed to a marry me... ...l'm not saying all this crap. Then forget about any marriage! I don't want to marry you. - Kush! Just say it. Kush, be a little romantic. What's the problem? C'mon... ...do it for us. Dimple, I love you. Please marry me! Okay. Congratulations. One minute. Not so fast. Dad, I have one condition. Oh god, what's your condition now? The condition was that, Luv and I, both get married together. I kept a condition, then how could Dimple be far behind. World's first bride... ...who came riding... ...a horse to her own wedding!
