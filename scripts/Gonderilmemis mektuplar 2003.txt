My late brother found out that there could be coal in Amasra. He tried hard and get engineers from France. He finally found the coal. We gained a lot from these mines. Not only us, but the whole Amasra did. He loved these mines as his children. He was calling them "My elder, my middle, my younger". The most dutiful came out to be the middle one. It was so productive. Cem... Brother... Cem Cemal... What are you doing here? - You should run away now! The Gendarmerie found out your place. - Stop! What are you doing? Isn't he Mehmet's son? Which one is he? The one who died was Cem. He is Cemal, the youngest one. - Welcome - Thanks. He's not been around for a long time. He was grieved for his brother's death and went away. He's working on the ships, I suppose. It's been 20 years now. The upper neighborhood. Everyone is spread out to Nice, London, Istanbul. The four of... us remain in this house. When the coal finished, so did this house. - When were the mines nationalized? - In 1936. - Did they pay you good? - Good? It was not even equal... to the value of middle mine. - Which one was the middle mine? The one at the Black Peak. Shall we change the subject Auntie? How are the preparations, Maestro? - Everyone is so eager It is going to be a good concert. They are working hard. Will you sing your father's song? - I don't know... there are unreadable parts - Don't worry. We'll complete it. I'll appreciate that. Cemal?! Unfortunately... Mom. Mom. Come Cemal! Come in. I could not reach you earlier. It took time for me to find your company. And when I found, your ship was in the middle of the ocean. Thanks Seyfi. When it rains, electricity goes off. My late brother used wind force when... there was no electricity in Amasra. - How? By a wind propeller. There it is... hanging on the pole. I asked many times Ali to repair it, but he didn't. You're right Mrs. Munevver. We keep saying alternative energy. Don't worry, I will send a craftsman from the municipality to repair it. Thank you Mr. Mayor. Shall we turn the radio on? Ceren's program is about to start. Maybe they don't want to listen, Ali. - I think she is very successful. I prefer her being a successful student. Dont't listen to her. It's another a way of praise. Mehmet Demirhan was 77 years old. Our condolence to his family and friends. I wonder whether Cemal made it? Seyfi had reached him but... I hope he whould stay. Poor woman, she is all alone... Mr. Mehmet died. Prepare the grave next to Cem tomorrow morning. Good evening. I'm Ceren. It's 9 pm and I am with you once again. We've been talking about traveling for some time now, seeing other... countries, other people and cultures. And for the last few programs, we're... talking about South America. I give you the information from brochures... and books. Now, I have a chance to go and see in real. I submitted an... application to an international youth camp, and if they accept, I will go to Uruguay. The camp will last 6 months. I will stay in a village. People from everywhere will also come to help inhabitants. I'll have lots of things to tell you when I come back. I will be the first one going to Uruguay from Amasra. Dad? - Hi Dad. - Welcome. - Did you listen the program? - It was crowded here you know... And we've learned that you're going away by the way. - I have told you, Mom. - You said you wanted to go... we didn't know you are about to go. - Good night - I want discuss this issue. - I have to write to Uruguay. - At this time of night? - It is daytime there, Mom. - There is nothing to worry about. - I don't know. When she wants something, she sees nothing else. We won't live forever... I am very sorry for Elmas. Welcome back. My condolences. - Thanks. He was a father for all of us. I will check with Elmas. See you. Welcome back. - My condolences. - Thank you. - My condolences Ms. Elmas. - Thank you. - The first words of these two lines. - But it can't be ready... for the concert anymore. - Let's find the words, the rest is easy. - Can we start Mr. Timur? - Sure... Come on everybody. We can even start the concert with this song. - Go away! Now! - Mom... Gulfem... Go Cem... Don't ever come back again. Ceren!... Dinner is ready... All these years... Didn't he miss his country? He didn't worry about his parents? - Sailing away for 20 years! - It is not our business Auntie. Gulfem, come to shipyard to decide the color. - O. K Why was he sailing away? The guy that you were talking about... He is a sailor. - I wonder if he'd come to my program? - Ceren, he is mourning. We were afraid of him rather than the president of the club. Once I was late for the exercise. I was fucked up. He was playing good. If it was today, one of the big teams would take him. He was left footed. Like Sergen. I think these two pictures tell about him better. He was our captain everywhere. This is from the picnic we went with Gulfem. Were you there too? The rain had started suddenly, remember? - No I wasn't. - You didn't join us much. You were sober. Cem was enthusiastic, aggressive... and he loved you so much. - Yes. They didn't let me join them much. I was little then... I used to watch them from afar with admiration. The love of Cem and Gulfem looked like the old times' love. Yet, she got married before mourning ended. Cem and Gulfem's song. I recorded it. How beautifully she sings, doesn't she? Because Cem loved the song, she learned it in one day. This is Cem. - Hi! - Hi Ceren. - I would like to see Mr. Seyfi. - He is on the way... Wait if you want. Can I help you? I just want to meet a friend of him. I would ask him... helping me to find Cemal Demirhan... Excuse me. - Are you always that lucky? - Are you him? - My name fits and I am his friend. - Great, I am doing a radio program. I'd like to make an interview with you. It starts at 9 p. m. - If you'll spare one hour for me. - What is the subject? I make programs about going away. I try to tell that there are other lives out of Amasra. Nobody looks outside. I learned that you've traveled around the world for 20 years. - That's what I want to talk about. - I was a sailor. - Traveling the world is different. - Don't say like that. Sailing on the oceans, docking to unknown harbors How do you feel? These are incredible things. - Your name? - Ceren. Sorry... meeting you suddenly... - Never mind... but this interview is not my kind. I'll appreciate if you don't insist. - O. K? - All right, Mr. Seyfi... - Was that Ceren leaving? - Yes. Why did she come? Hi, Cemal! - She asked me to join her program. - You refused, of course. - For God's sake. Poor thing... She was about to cry. She is doing a good job comparing to her age. She is Gulfem's daughter, you know. Thanks. - Have a sit... Aren't you drinking? - Later. I've got things to do. Turn the radio on, will you? Good evening, I am Ceren. It's 9 pm and I am with you on time again. I ask you why you are still at the same place? - This kid is very arrogant. - Let her be. - You spoil her very much. - Let me do. I hope you will enjoy the program... I was going to have a guest here He's local, spent 20 years on the sea. We would talk about "Other places"... but he didn't accept my invitation. Anyway, we'll continue without him. I'll talk about Gibraltar, a way to Atlantic through Mediterranean. Great! He came. The guest I mentioned you is here. - Welcome, Mr. Cemal. Please. - Thank you. - I complained about you to my friends. - Yes, I heard. We'll forgive you if you tell us nice things. We'll see. I'll try since I am here. Cool. You have already passed through Gibraltar, I suppose. - Sure... Many times. - What's like the feeling? I passed on my first time. Gibraltar was the first land I saw since we set sail from Turkey. It had been a week since we were on the sea and I couldn't see the land. Besides, it was my first time on the ship, I was bored. I checked the map to see how far I was from Turkey and Amasra. However, the map didn't show the nearby. There was only Atlantic and the emptiness. We would not get off to the harbor at Gibraltar either. If we would have, I would have run away from the ship. What was the feeling? Regret... fear. - You're not talking with a hero actually. - I thought you chose being on the seas. - You were a sailor for 20 years. - Let's say, I got used to it. You must have seen many harbors, cities. - Yes... fifty maybe sixty. - Great... Do you collect postcards? Not on purpose, however I sometimes bought. - I'd love to see them. - Sure... How did you spend time on the ship? Since you weren't always working... - Some read, some write letters. - Were you writing? - Yes. - To whom were you often writing? Mines were not like that. How is that? You address to someone, like "Dear Dad", right? - I mean whoever you send to. - Yes, but I didn't send my letters. "Unsent Letters"... What a great title for a book. Your imagination is perfect. Shall I turn the light on? When are you leaving? After 20 years, is that the first thing you say to me, Mom? You will ruin everything. They will understand that you are Cem. Gulfem... - isn't it early? - The concert night is approaching. I need to practise Our soloist takes her work seriously. - Selma, have you seen Cemal? - Yes. He was in our place yesterday. He couldn't' see his father either. He is very upset. You have not seen him yet, have you? No. I heard him on Ceren's program. I did not know Cemal so sensitive. We looked at the old pictures. We talked about you and Cem. How much he loves his brother. After He tried not to cry next to us, but he couldn't. So, he left early. - Excuse me. - Yes. - Is Mr. Seyfi here? - He's at the courthouse. Please, come in. - No, there is no one at the shop. - Why are you looking for Mr. Seyfi? - I would talk about something with him. - Auntie! - Yes? What should be the age difference between a man and a woman? There were 20 years between my parents, yet 3 to 5 is normal. That's Hakan. Could you tell him to come to the caf half an hour later? Hello... She will be at the caf half an hour later. Bye. He is your age and polite, too. Come on everybody, let's start... Gulfem, take this, it is yours! Welcome Cemal. Look who is inside? Bring us tea... - Welcome Cemal. - You grow up. Where have you been up to now, Cemal? - Hi. - I thought you wouldn't come. - Am I late? - Since you may forget... Please! - I have only found these. - Thank you very much. - Montevideo. Beautiful, isn't it? - It is, indeed. So, you have been in Montevideo? So I won't be the first one from Amasra... visiting there. I'll join a camp in Uruguay, if they'll accept me... Good for you. Actually, I can't say I've been there. We stayed there only for few hours. - Sorry, I keep you standing. - What would you like to drink? - I can't stay Ceren. - I have things to do before leaving. - When are you leaving? Tomorrow, I think. - Alas! - Bye Ceren. Bye. I am curious about your "Unsent Letters". - Is he leaving? - Unfortunately yes. - Don't be jealous but he's handsome. - There is nothing to be jealous. He was almost going to be your uncle. Mom? Come in Ceren. - What are you doing here alone? - Nothing... Isn't it my bedroom? What are they? - What are you doing? - Just a minute Mom Washington, New Orleans, Saint Louise, Bolivia, Montevideo. So? - Good. - That's it? Very good. The capital city of Uruguay where I'll be going. - It is beautiful, isn't it? - Yes. - They sent them from there? - Cemal gave them. He's nice... he's a different person. His brother was your lover, they say. - Did Cemal say so? - No, Hakan did. Everyone in Amasra knew it. Your love was well known. - Don't be ridiculous. - Can you tell me, Mom? Please. - There is nothing to tell Ceren. - I don't think so Mom. Come on. Well, later then? I am curious about it. - If you don't go... - Before I go... What are you doing here together? Making peace... I heard that you couldn't talk to Gulfem. She came after you but you didn't see her. She complained about it to Selma. Remember the kid who denounced Cem to police? Nuri. He came to my office today. To talk about something with me. I want my father's grave to be done before I go. Do you know anybody for this? - We'll talk with the same guy... who made Cem's grave. He'll do the same, there'll be unity. Yes... - Machu Pichu? - Mountain in Chili. - The lost city of the Inkas in Peru. - Yeah, okay. - Iguazu? - A waterfall... - Yes. The country? - Come on, Ali - Is it in Uruguay? - Argentine. Valle del Claro... de Luna. Beautiful, isn't it? - What is that? A valley at Bolivia, means "Moonlight Valley" It may be Moonlight. The name of the boat. - Let's name it Serdar. - Not romantic at all. - Your brother's name. - I didn't know he was named. Wasn't he dead before the birth? - He died during the birth... We had even prepared his room. It still hurts. Auntie!... If he had lived, he would be 16. The only man of our descent. - Don't do that. - Don't!... Hold on. It's for you. Sorry to bother you. I wanted to ask which way to take to Uruguay. There's a direct flight to Montevideo from Madrid but I'll see nowhere. I think there's a ferry from Buenos Aires. But you better search other ways Okay, great. Thank you very much. Will I see your "Unsent Letters"? I don't know Ceren. Bye. She'll go to Uruguay, asking for information. Gulfem hardly stood on, you will ruin her order of 20 years. You blew everything and ran away. Now you came back and will blow again. Cem? Brother? Cem? Cemal!... What are you doing here? Why did you come? You should escape immediately. The Gendarmerie knows your location. - How do you know? - Someone had denounced you. Gulfem was going to come, we would go together. Stop! What are you doing? I'll take the car so the police will trace me. You go, now! - Why are you leaving Cemal? - 20 years wasn't enough? - I went once. - So? - Since I went away once. - So? Is there anything I should know Cemal? - I can't tell Seyfi. I couldn't explain the first time. There is nothing to do actually. Let's say: It is something like a fate... You are like a puzzle, there is nothing to say. - When are you leaving? - Tomorrow morning. I promised Celal. Let's go to radio, I'll give some stuff to Ceren. - Your dad wrote this song to you - What do you mean? A six sentenced-lyrics, isn't it? If the third line starts with L and the fourth one with F... then it becomes GULFEM. I am certain. Hello. Tonight I will talk... - Good evening. - Welcome. - Are you ready? - Almost. Mr. Cemal left them. Great... He sent the letters I asked. Dear Ceren, I leave tomorrow morning. We probably can't see each other. Bye. Could you write the lyrics leaving the unreadable parts? - Can I turn the radio on? - Sure. I have letters of a person who was away from Amasra. He didn't refuse and gave them to me. Maybe because he is leaving again. These are the unsent letters. We're first to read them, even the one who suppose to receive didn't. Even the thought of it makes me excited. The name is scrawled. "Purple Violet" can be read on the third line. So, title might be... "tulip or hyacinth". The number of syllable fits as well. I am writing. It might be addressed to a lover, a mother or a friend. Maybe we'll understand while reading them. We may not be sure yet we may feel it. Maybe we will feel different things. There are some other words scrawled on it. Maybe the name of the person. Let me read it first while you're listening "Chan Chan" from the BVSC. We will come back to the "Unsent Letters" afterwards. The boy came from school and said his Mom "The teacher asked the capital... of France, noone knew but I did. Is it because I'm from Amasra?" His mother said "of course son". - The other kids are not from Amasra? It wasn't in Amasra. Listen first. The next day, he came back and said... "Teacher asked the highest mountain of Turkey. Again no one knew except me. Just because I'm from Amasra, isn't it?". She says "Yes". The next day, he says"Mom, today we competed our penis, mine is bigger... Just because I'm from Amasra, right?" She replies "No son, you started to school at the age of 15. - You went away and never returned. - Yes. Remember when you helped me cheating in history, we got caught. You got null for no reason. - Of course, I do. I'll get you a raki. - Don't you remember him? - Looks familiar but... - Huseyin... Huseyin the Camel. - Yeah, okay. Welcome back Cemal. Do you recognize me? - I surely do, Ali. - I miss you much! This morning, we saw the land by sun rising. I hadn't seen the land for a long time. I couldn't see but I knew there were people out there. I wanted to talk. I didn't know their language, nor was I close to them to get myself heard. Then I remembered my mirror. It's been months I had not looked at my face... in the mirror but I kept on carrying it. - Are you O. K? - We better stop I was sure my light reached them. I no longer felt lonely. Maybe there's no need to see the land to get my mirror reach people. It passes through distances and its light reaches them... enables me to reach them. It could not get only to Amasra, to you. Anyway, I can't ask it from my mirror. It's resentful. - Raki gets better. - Cemal! What is going on here? What's up? - Don't let him cause trouble. What are you celebrating when this country has 200 billion dollars debt? - Grill or beer? - Give ease. Fickle... Mayor the Fickle. - What are you saying, you drunk? There is a new election or what? You assemble the perks. We gathered for Cemal. Remember? Cemal Demirhan. - The burglar brother of Cem the Brave... - Mustafa, it is disgraceful. So, he has no money as he came back. Your brother died at that operation. You took all the money and ran away. If Cem had seen you, he would have died from suffering. You fickle perks, bone lickers! Enough! I believed that everything would be better... What a pitty! - Never mind Mustafa. - I'm not talking about Mustafa. I remember the days everything was pure. When we cared about being a good person and loving our country. I knew that you were Cem. I was sure when you held the orange with your left hand. How did you stand not to see Gulfem, so long? It has been a long time now... She has a life, a daughter, a husband. They were on the boat the other day... - Did she upset you? You said she got married before my brother's mourning ended. I prepare your clothes. I am not leaving Mom. I've got things to sort out. They think I got Cemal's money and ran. - You did not take it, did you? What kind of mother you are? What is this endless anger? Endless pain. You try to hurt me too. Don't bother, it already hurts. - My son died. - He was also my brother. - He died because of you. - Don't be perfidious. I always tried to keep him away from politics and trouble. Yet, he put himself in danger because of you and died. Mom, he did not know that Operation I didn't tell him. Somehow he found out the denouncement. He came to warn me. He suddenly thought about jumping in the car and escaped. I could not stop him. - You were always looking for trouble. Not listening to anyone. And, you made Gulfem fall in love with you. - I fell in love with her. - You didn't abandon politics, still. No, I did not because I also loved my country. I wish I would be dead in his place. Nobody had to die. I'm hungry. - I am making an omlette - Very good. - Good morning. - I got up early so I went out. Yes. Wake Ceren up, she eats before it gets cold. Dad... I've got an e-mail. I am in. - I'm glad to hear. - It's going to be great. Did you hear, Mom? I will be in Uruguay for 6 months. - So you won't take the college exams. - I will next year. You'll lose one more year then. Not registered this year either. - I didn't like the department. - Medicine school? - You wanted to be a psychiatrist. - No... I don't want to be a doctor. Enough. You will talk later. Do you know what you want to be? She must be going to her refuge. I will go and get her. We can't talk at the Municipality. I'll go to jetty, you come there. O.K. Hello? Is Mayor available? Ceren? Ceren... - Haven't you gone? - Are you crying? Yes. They accept me but mom doesn't let me to go. We argued. Instead of arguing, be nice to her you will persuade her. - But she doesn't listen to me. - She'is a soft, lovely person. - Now go home and do what I said, okay? - O. K. What's up Cemal? - This money thing... - Which money? The fucking money that Mustafa has mentioned. Did you take a fucking drunk's words seriously? - So, there is a problem. - For God's sake, it was 20 years ago. When you went away, a rumor was spread out. And there was no money. - Celal, you are a piece of shit. - Do you hear yourself Cemal? - I am Cem. - Fuck. When I got the denouncement, I went directly to Celal, without... saying a word to anyone in the police station. I knew he was in this action. My aim was to bargain with him. To get the money from you and give you some time to escape. I would keep the denouncement as a secret. I told him, he felt ghastly I asked him whether it is logical. He didn't reply. He opened the chest. And gave me a case full of money. I got shocked I didn't know that you gave it to him. "Finally luck strikes me!" I said to myself. I had nothing to do. You know I sent Cemal to you afterwards. The robbery took place in Sinop. How did you know Cem had the money? One of the them was arrested and told everything. They informed us. We really didn't expect you to come back to Amasra. So, the Johnnys' salaries at military base turned out to be a hotel? We called them "plant", you know. The money wasn't enough of course... Moreover we used some credits of late Ozal's impetus. So, what do you say about Ahmet the Guard? Nothing will happen to him since we can't inform the police. No. That means I can't declare my brother's innocence. Neither could I catch up my father. I can't explain anything to my mother. Nor I could say Glfem that it is me. If the police caught me, I would have already been out. Yet, my punishment goes on... life sentence. I will go back to my exile, Seyfi. - Three days left for time lapse, Cem. There won't be any reason for you to go. - Legally no. Auntie... Could you please come? - Coming. Yes? Mrs. Munevver, let's change this because this kind makes noise. There are bakelite types now. - Since you started, finish this. It's my brother's souvenir. We grew up with that noise, it doesn't matter. - Let's change Cemal's gravestone too. - Three days left. No rush. You'll be charged for 20 years. After my departure, I mean. Did you talk to marble maker? I'll leave you money for my dad's gravestone. - No need to. What could it cost? - It's okay... I have money. - Please Cem. - Don't be ridiculous. We don't need money on the ship. - There is another issue, Cem. What is it? - I got all the money you sent home. - How comes? Your mother brought them to me whenever you sent her. She asked me to give them back to you when they would pass away. I will return to my exile, mom. How much I would like to hug you and Gulfem. How I miss my brother and dad. We were very happy, how I miss those days. There will be ten songs at the repertoire. Let Gulfem sing the song "Gruff Sea". She sings it very well. Gulfem... I am leaving. I came to say goodbye. You have just come and now you are leaving, Cem? Wouldn't you have two words to tell me if you have come? Okay go then. I bore your death, so will I your leaving. Come on everybody... We are starting. Gulfem... you go Stop, Cem! Come here. Please Cem, I am asking you. - Welcome Mr. Ali. - Hello, how is it going? Very well. It's going to be a good performance. Will you listen a while? - I don't want to disturb you. - Not at all. It was Cem. He is leaving. - It will be Auntie. - Of course it will. Perfect. There is a reason to call it as wind energy. - I have to thank Mayor. - My parents have arrived. I have bad news for you Dad. Just the traveling expense is $800. Never mind. You will pay us back. It would remain like that, if you didn't come, thank you. I put Ali on the phone. I said Ali would get the phone. Good evening. Mr. Mayor. Hello Celal, how are you? The propeller makes that noise. Because it is metallic. The phone is immobile, you know. Anyway, we will find a solution. - Is my mommy tired? - Come in... I will often write you. It is only six months, it will pass fast. You don't know what longing is. I am going to miss you so much. When Gendarmerie came to take me, I had already sensed the catastrophe. Like the one we always see on the news... But I could not ask anything. Cem, my boy. It was hard to identify him, he had your jacket. But I understood that he was Cemal. You looked like each other but you smell indifferent. Cemal smelled like a geranium. Are you going to leave? Don't, if you don't want. Do you want to go to Uruguay by boat? - Pinar cannot cross Atlantic sea. - I mean "Moonlight". It is going to be ready in few days. - It would be great but I leave soon. You'll come over to take me back. - Okay, see you then Let's go back. You haven't gone yet. I could not. I wanted to but... I could not. You made me suffer to death. You didn't tell you were alive or where you were. The time I called here, I learned that you were already married. People were still mourning for me. - Don't say that. Yet my sore could not stop my feelings for you. Oceans, skies made my love bigger. You were always in my dreams. Don't do that Cem. Let's not... - Gulfem... - You have to go, Cem. I cannot save my balance, we will ruin everything. Shall I lose you for the second time? Let's pretend as you didn't come here and I would go back to my misery. Like a dream. - I saw you in my dreams hundred times. Mostly here... When I woke up, I was suffering more. Especially now. Let's go away together Gulfem, now! - Please Cem, I want it so much. But impossible, even if it's for my love, happiness and life, I can't. I can't do this to Ali nor can I destroy Ceren's world. Well Cem, we have already missed the happiness. There is nothing to do now. What is that? My grandmother told me to give my future wife. - Why is it over there? On that day, I tried to reach you by reflecting the mirror from here. Then my mother came to tell me about Cemal's death... that everybody thought it was me... so I had to run away. I took the bracelet with me but I could not reach you. If I could get you, I would tell you to take it from there. But I couldn't. Don't give it to me, Cem. We are living our fates as if we become aware of... Gulfem! - I am awful. - Shall we go to us? I saw his body. My father brought me back home. I saw the mirror shining at the peak, thought I was dreaming. I had ran before to that shining many times. If only I could have believed in my eyes, everything would be different. But I saw the corpse Selma. They put him into the ambulance, Elmas was crying. How could I know he was Cemal? - It is like a fiction. - Yes. - What can we do now Gulfem? Nothing... - I asked him to leave. - Are you sure? Yes, Selma. I owe Ali a lot. Going away always sounds me like a joke actually. Now it's the time and I've to confess that I flounder a bit, now. On the other hand, I think 6 months is not so long. Thanks for everything Seyfi. Pass my regards to Selma. For you, I have been alive for Are you ready? I like this dress of you most. - I know... that's why I wore it. - Are you nervous? - Yes, a little. - You are well prepared, your dad's song is very good. - Yes. It'll be very hard for me to be away from dad. - I asked Cem to leave. - Will he do? Yes. I begin to understand what she means. I feel like missing them much. It is the end. When I come back from Uruguay, 6 months later... - Where is she going? - To Uruguay. To work in a youth camp. What will she do there? How come Gulfem let her go? She is still a kid. Gulfem doesn't like it actually... But nothing will happen. She is a clever kid. You made dolmas, ha? Thanks, I missed it so much. I know. Once it snows, the lettuce's leaf... will be more delicious. I'll do more often then. It is your grandfather's song. - Why didn't you bring Cemal? - He is leaving tonight. - You drink with sugar, don't you? - Yes, Mom. I bought new sheet for you... I will change the curtains as well. Do you drink much? No... I am going Mom. I have to go in a while. I got my ticket. Good. I saw Gulfem today. She begged me to leave. Good... Mom, don't do that, please. It's really good. It's the first time I have ever heard this song. Now we will sing another song, not well known but very nice. The chorus was planned to sing however... we would like to ask Mrs. Gulfem to sing it. - Mr. Timur! - Lf she permits, I will play the lute. She got very excited. I don't understand how he did such a thing. I told him to do so. Sorry, but you sang it very well. Gulfem... Why didn't you tell me, Gulfem? Why didn't you tell me about Ceren? I will go to look for mum. - We'll talk tomorrow, Cem. - Ceren is coming. Don't say anything to her. I am begging you. You sang very well, Mom. Hi. You have not gone yet, then? I better go back. - Let's go inside, you will get cold. - No, I won't. You go, Gulfem. Can you tell Seyfi to come here? I believe I'll leave before you. - We will meet before, right? - Sure, I will give you my address. Your ship may come to Uruguay. It will be great. Come on Ceren, the rain will start. - Bye. - Ceren! I want to give this to you. - Looks like very precious. - So are you. You are very kind. We'll wait until tomorrow, you have waited for 20 years. So, Elmas kept it as a secret for 20 years, ha? - She didn't tell even to my father. - Ali knew it then? Yes. They left Amasra after they got married. I remember. Ceren was born when they returned. When will the rain stop? - It is cold. - Thanks. It is going to be very hard. She is going tomorrow for real. I have always supported her but... I'll miss her. - Yes... - Put this on, will you? - I am not cold. Let's take a trip to Istanbul, once Ceren is gone. It'll be full moon next week. Prince's Islands will be magnificent. We'll see... You know, I couldn't survive, if you didn't marry me? I will handle it Ali. I trust you. - Is Elmas not here? - She went shopping. Did you have breakfast? - I am not hungry. You will drink tea, right? Have a sit. You were going to leave, Cem. You agreed to go. I haven't known about Ceren. You didn't tell me. - You have to leave Cem. - You tell me to forget everything. I did it for 20 years. I came back, you again told me to go. But now there is Ceren. I can't do that, Gulfem! You have to do it for Ceren. If I didn't have Ceren, I would hug you at the first time I saw you... despite my resentment, I would beg you to take me away with you. Ceren is your daughter, but she exists thanks to Ali. You leave me in desperation. Ceren exists because we loved each other. I saw your dead body and wanted to die, but I was carrying your baby. I couldn't kill myself because of my baby. Ali made it happen, Cem. He proposed me... he has been in love with for years... even though he knew my love for you. He knew everything about us. I accepted it for the sake of my baby. They were going to shoot us. But still, I came to Amasra. I could not reach you, I was hiding in the mine. I sent you a message to meet there. I didn't know you were pregnant. If I knew, I wouldn't have accepted the robbery or I would not have run. - I didn't know you were alive either. - Yes... But, the sacrifice is only expected from me. Everything is built on my death. Unfortunately, I am alive Gulfem. I still love you. And my daughter. Whatever it costs I will pay to Ali. I will beg him. Or kill him. You too, were scratched on my heart. I have always made you live in me. But we'll suffer more if we don't accept, so are the others. This is our fate, Cem. It is ridiculous, Gulfem. We had all the suffering. There is nothing left for others. You wouldn't know how much I miss your hugs. Let's go Gulfem, let me always hug you. Ceren! Ceren! Please don't come. I have to talk to her alone. Ceren... - Can I come? - No! - Please Ceren... You've to listen to me - No! There is no reason to listen to you. I don't blame you, he is a nice guy. I like him too. I wouldn't believe that I would compete with my mother. - Ceren... please, listen to me. - So, this is what life is about. You manage with the other brother when the elder died. Ceren, he is Cem, he is not dead. You don't know how much I loved him. I thought he was dead. I got shocked when I learned he is Cem. Yet again, I begged him to leave. I tried to bury my love for him, not to hurt Ali. You didn't bury it deeply, then. Anyway I don't care. I only care about Dad, he can't live without you. If you upset him... I can't stand it. I will go away and never come back. Okay Ceren. All right. Let me come next you. - I don't want you to come. - Ceren, please. No! - Ceren... - You can't be apart... She is there. - Listen to me. - There is nothing to listen. Your love exceeds after 20 years. Do whatever you want. It is not that simple. If you listen to me... I don't want to. Don't you see? What will my father do now? He also loves her much. Listen Ceren! I am your father. Yes. - It is a lie. You are lying. I've just learned. I didn't know either. Your mom told me last night. Cem... - You didn't tell her, did you? - I did Gulfem. How could you, Cem? You didn't tell her, did you? She is my daughter... For 20 years, she knows Ali as her father, Cem! I beg you to leave Cem. Even you are my first and only love. For Ceren's sake. You'll come with us to police station. There is a denouncement about you. My mother. She must not see me. Thanks. Celal! Police took Cem to the station. A denouncement, I suppose. Okay, call Ahmet. What the fuck!. 2 days have left for the time lapse. Don't be afraid, they can't prove anything. Did Ali know? Ali wouldn't do such a thing. We get him, Sir. Sir! You put Cemal in, what's up? He's said to be Cem Demirhan, who was responsible for a robbery in 80s. How could it be Sir? Cem died during that operation... - How do you know? - I was there when it happened His car was rolled over. - Welcome Mayor. - You get our Cemal, right? - We got a denouncement. It is not you messing around again, I hope? Of course not Mr. Mayor. I just saw him coming to station. Someone said that he was Cem. - Yes... he also claims to be Cemal. Mustafa, bring Mr. Cemal here! Mr. Ahmet is also coming. Sorry, we messed things up! Sorry for the mistake, Mr. Cemal is free. It happens sometimes. - It's okay. Since it's solved. It has already came out to time lapse. I was so afraid. - Please Cem, try to understand me. - Really? - Sorry, but when we got the call... - I see. Things like that happen. I was almost blamed for it once again. Believe me, it was not me in the previous time. I loved Cem much. I believe you, don't worry. It was an adult male voice. I'm sure it was not Nuri. He was just a kid at that time. - This one was done by phone, too. It was a woman, I guess... calling from a place with a scratchy noise. Drink my tea to make peace. It is me Dad. Where have you been? Got prepared? Where is your mum? - Who is Cem, Dad? - An old friend of ours. He was believed to be killed in a political action. - But it was his brother died instead. - I know that. They had an intimacy with Gulfem... They were 20 years old, I think... - Daddy, is he my father? - Yes Ceren, he is. You are my father, Daddy. I will always be with you. I am not going to Uruguay. - Did Gulfem tell you? - No, Cem did. - You are going to Uruguay, Ceren. - No Daddy, I can't. - I can't leave you in such a state. - You should go Ceren. This is our story, let your own story begin... I am going to take Gulfem. Dad, are you sure? Daddy... tell her that I want her to come back, too. What is this? He always has problems. - Come on guys... Selma'll make a soup for us. - I don't come, Ceren's going. We'll come later, we need to talk a little. Let's solve this matter Gulfem. Let's get Ceren and discuss it. Please, let's not try so hard, Cem. I don't try hard, I want you and Ceren. Don't... Cem, we've talked about this. We love each other and Ceren is my daughter. I begged you Cem. I still am. I wish I could. We missed the happiness 20 years ago. We can't catch it if we'll miss again. Gulfem? Please Cem. Yes, Gulfem? Ceren wants you back home, too. She wanted me to tell you. Please Cem, go... I have always trusted you. Shall we go home? You go Ali, I'm not fine. I just want to be alone for a while. I will help Ceren to get prepared. It's O.K. Gulfem, all right darling. My God, what kind of sin did I ever commit? How can you restrain yourself when you love him that much? I can't believe myself either, but I did. I don't know where I found the strength from. Hello... Hello... I think that was the noise. It happened 20 years ago. The wind propeller's noise at the Stone Mansion. It must have been... Mrs. Munevver who denounced Cem. So, the calls had been made from there. It was a man who had called me. He said that Cem Demirhan was in Amasra. "You sure, where is he?" I asked. He said something like medal mind. Or I misunderstood because of the noise. I asked again his place. He said "At Black Peak, in the old coal mine" - Gulfem? - It is me. Have you seen Ceren? Where is she? The time is coming. How did you know that Cem was hiding in the middle mine? What are you saying? What middle mine? I know that it was you who denounced him. - For God's sake Gulfem! - Don't ever lie to me. Your aunt's denouncement made it all clear. - My aunt denounced who? - Cem. - I didn't know it, believe me. - I can. But I want to learn detail. How did you find out that Cem was hiding in the middle mine? - Gulfem, I'll die if you leave me. - I know all these, Ali. You said it when you proposed me. You said that he was dead, but you... didn't say it was because of you. - I thought he'd go to jail. - You knew he was wanted. He tried to reach me instead of escaping. But he couldn't reach me... and you learned it somehow. How? I was waiting for the postman at the corner of your street. I thought he would write you... One day you went to Elmas, a boy came to put a letter in your mailbox. I understood it was from Cem. Ali, I begged the man I love to leave. I said that I respect you, I owe... you a lot... that this is our fate and we have to obey it. However, it is not the fate... just your ambush. What should I regret, now? Cemal who died? Elmas? My daughter who doesn't even know... her dad? Or the love I couldn't live? - Mom... - Ceren. We made you unhappy. Please, forgive us... - I am growing up, Mom. - Ceren I have to find Cem. I hurt him a lot. He might have gone already, you know. It's all right mom. Selma, do you know where Cem is? I have to find him. It was Ali who called the police. He surrendered. I'm sure you wouldn't do that if you knew these would happen? They also loved each other much. Pains are formed out of loves. What a pity. As a loving person, you have to understand her Dad... I feel I can love Cem, Daddy. But, don't be afraid... my love for you will never end. You gave me tender and trust for 20 years. I thought you were the best father of the world. The time's coming... you wanted me to go. You said on my return, everything would be better. You won't forget, will you? I've to admit that I'm upset. Because you told mom you could not live without her. I thought you love me most in this life. I love you Dad. - We are not going? - Waiting for the document. For 2 days he will be sentence for He confessed that he's Cem Demirhan. What can I do? He was upset and mad at some people. That's why he did it. Don't push me hard Mr. Seyfi. The court will give the decision. Cem! She is calling you. Aren't we going? - Why did you do that? - You told me to leave. "Leave! Go! Go!" Here, I am leaving. I couldn't leave in another way. I wanted to but I couldn't. I denounced myself. Continue to pay your unpayable debts. How I regret Cem! You don't know how much it hurts me. It hurt me, too. And still does... What I called fate was his ambush. Ali denounced you... just because of him we suffered all these years. I have just learned Cem. I ran to catch you. I was afraid your leaving. I prayed God, not to let you go. But you're going now, and like this. I was responsible for that. - What are we going to do, Cem? - We made lots of mistakes Gulfem. We suffered much. But now it's easier. You love me, don't you? Don't you? A whole lot. I always loved you. You don't owe anybody that will stop you, don't you? But you are going Cem... to jail. What if I went away, without knowing that you are mine? Now, I'll be in jail for some time But I'll know that I have you, Gulfem - I have, haven't I? - Yes Cem, you have... Come on, we are going.
