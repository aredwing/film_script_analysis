Let's go! There are people with no clear whereabouts living in here. Some were in dispute with the nearby Iwamoto domain over water rights, that's why they spread rumors and avoided meeting people. If you are scared, go back! But... Ah! Ah- I'm going first! Wait for me! Hey! Hey! Shigeji. Shigeji! What is it? I can hear something. What? I don't hear anything. Okay let's go! Awesome~ Hey, we can go back now can't we? No, let's pick some more. A goblin? A goblin! "Raiou - The Lightning Tree" Father. What happened, Rai? You went tough on villagers again? Yeah. I chased them away. I don't want them to disturb the mountain. Sakakibara. Sakakibara. Sakakibara! Dono... You were dozing off during your guard duty? I am terribly sorry. I am terribly sorry. Someone! Dono! Dono! Dono! Dono... Dono... Dono! Dono! I beg for your forgiveness. Too late! Please hang on, Dono! Dono, with all due respect... Killing people... ...is a serious thing, Dono. Step aside! Insolent fellow. You... Dono! Dono! Dono! Dono! This is... Leave the door open. Yes. The wind feels good... Dono's disease is one rooted from childhood. He has suffered a lot ever since he was young. Perhaps it is a disease of the heart? Why do you think so? Ever since I started working here, I have never once heard Dono smile before. Sorry for speaking unnecessarily. Your father is a village headman, is he not? He is merely the chief of a small village and is also a petty peasant. You are not a peasant any longer. You are a samurai. From now, you are officially... ...promoted to a vassal of the Shimizu family. Yes. We need retainers like you... ...to stay by Dono's side. For tonight's guard duty, Seta Sukejirou will be taking over. Enokido. If you had beheaded Sakakibara at that moment, your status will be gravely affected. Seta had shield him with his own body. He had come to your rescue, Dono. From now onwards, he will be working by your side. Young Master! Mother is here. Come, smile. Come, smile. Smile! Smile! Smile! Smile! Why are you... Please stop. You hateful child. Dono. Did something happen? I cannot sleep. Tell me a story. Even if you ask me to tell you a story... since I'm just a country bumpkin, I can talk about nothing but my hometown. Talk. Seta Village is... a small village surrounded by mountains. There are vast meadows on the outskirts. They have become a splendid hunting ground. And then? The thawing snow that flows into the river... Boring. You don't have anything else to talk? There is a mountain called Seta Mountain. Can one hunt there as well? No. One can't? Boring. But... There are goblins in Seta Mountain. Do not talk nonsense. It is the truth. Who asked you to tell me children's fairy tales? There are indeed goblins. If there are not, I would be in deep trouble. You like it that much? What a strange tree. Gingko and sakura... ...were both living. But the ginko tree collapsed due to thunder. After that, sakura bud sprouted out. It is a sturdy tree. You were born on that day the thunder struck. Even in the midst of cracking thunder, you still smiled happily. You are saying that again. Everything is thanks to this tree. Your devotion hitherto... ...is fully acknowledged by Kubou-sama. From now on too, you shall remain in service for Sir Narimichi. Is it fine with you? Yes. Enokido. The rumor has even reached this place. Sir Narimichi's mental derangement... is getting increasingly serious, is it not? There are people who say laughable things like the third Master... ...of the Shimizu family is a blockhead. Even if he is the son of Kubou-sama, marring the family's reputation is an unforgivable thing. When Sir Narimichi has an uncontrollable rage, you may, with your own hands,... Understand? However, Dono is the son of Kubou-sama. This is also Kubou-sama's intention. What did the elderly council say? They wish for your illness to be cured. They are worried? Could my illness be cured? Or would I end up going mad like Mother? What are you speaking? There is not such a thing... You do not have to conceal it. Am I not dreadful? Ever since I was young, I have been having incessant nightmares. This is because of blood? Because of the blood I got from Mother? Dono... What would you say about... using a good rest and leaving Edo for a while? I am Seta. Is there anything I could be of help? Yeah. This time, we have chosen your hometown... to be the place where Dono would be taking his rest. I beg your pardon? He would be going to Seta Village. I am terribly sorry. For some reason, the hawk does not follow our whistle. - Perhaps it gets restless along the way... - Do not make excuses! Step aside. You may not go. Among those who entered Seta Mountain, there are people who have lost their lives. Goblins? What cowards. Follow him. Yes. Dono! Dono! Please wait for us! Dono! Dono! Dono! Dono! Dono! Dono! Seta. We leave the rest to you. Dono! Dono! Dono! Dono! Dono! That slant-eyed peasant. He has only guts. Ah-! Ah- Ah- Hmm. Insolent fellow. Hm? A woman? Hey. Hey. The wind feels good. Just stay like this. Do not ever enter the forest again. No prey today? What is wrong? The cord is broken only. You were seen by villagers again? There was not anyone in the forest. I am a retainer from the Shimanaka domain. My name is Shikauchi Rokurouta. The one who will be taking over here... ...is Seta Suketarou, the head of Seta Village. You are Seta's brother? Yes. I am very thankful to you... ...for having taken great care of my younger brother Sukejirou. On the occasion of your hunting, please do make sure to drop by our house. Dono. Did you obtain an injury? No... Do not stand there, Riemon. You are as wary as ever. What business do you have? I want to have a deal. Is the life of a traitor... ...worth pleading for even now? There is nothing precious about lives. Interesting. Try telling me. I shall assassinate the Master of Shimizu family. Then that will be the end of the domain of Shimanaka, right? What is your wish? Do not meddle with my daughter. That is all. Reveal yourself, goblin. Do not fear. I shall not draw out my sword. Who are you? Pardon me! Father! Step aside, Rai. Step aside! No! I told you not to enter the forest again. Leave! Quickly! Why did you obstruct me? Why did you cover for that man? You too, Father. Why was you about to kill him? Dono has returned. Dono has returned home. Welcome back, Dono. Dono has come back. Welcome back, Dono. Where did you go, Dono? Dono. Do you... ...really believe there are goblins on that mountain? That is for sure. There is a female goblin. You saw one, sir? Dono! I did. That goblin saved my life. That goblin... ...must be my younger sister. Twenty years ago, A retainer of Iwamoto domain, I took on a secret mission assigned by the domain. Kidnap the daughter of the village headman... ...and kill her. Your name... ... is not Rai. Yuu... Yuu! Yuu! Yuu! Someone! Yuu-sama! - Yuu! - Yuu-sama! Yuu! Yuu! Yuu! I betrayed Iwamoto domain, and took you with me on the run. While I thought it would be fine as long as I do not come back to the village, I could not do it. That day when the Master of Shimizu family, when it finally came down to that moment, I have now failed to carry out the assassination... I shall patrol the mountain. You... Go back to the Seta family. The day I was born, there were cracking thunder, were there not? That is... ...the night I kidnapped you. You are lying. I don't believe it. Do... Do resent me. Do not fool with me! Shimanaka domain here and Iwamoto domain next to us... have been disputing over the water rights for many long years. Twenty years ago, Iwamoto domain used coercion... ...to demand to change the waterways in Seta Village. My father, the village headman at that time, repelled such demand. So as retribution, they abducted your younger sister. My father was too anxious for Yuu that he passed away. Afterwards, the rumor that there is a goblin in Seta Mountain started to spread. I... have always believed that is Yuu. Tomorrow, please allow me to go to the mountain. Sukejirou. What are you doing at this late hour? She is still alive... Mother! Mother! Sukejirou. Mother. Yuu is... Yuu is living in the mountain. Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! - Let's go play! - Yeah! Wasaku-san! Wasaku-san! Wasaku-san. Who is that? Over there, who is that? Yuu! Yuu! Yuu... You have come back... Each and every year, Mother has bought clothes and kept them for you. Kimono and obi too. Everything here is yours. Yuu, how do you think about this kimono? No... No need. You not have to wear these anymore. Do not touch it! Yuu. How can you understand? Not "you." Call me "brother." Do not follow me. Where are you going? What are you doing? Come! I will borrow this. Hey! That is my hatchet! Ah- That was close. O-Yuu-san. As a daughter of the Seta family, that behavior will bring trouble. Will bring trouble! Is it true that the daughter of Seta family has come back? Yes. It is uncertain whether she was brought up by wolves, no, goblins. Well, it is no big deal, is it not? It seems that Dono was the one who found her. Yeah? Goblin or whatsoever... I thought he was going to get another disease. Well, our blockhead Dono too... Thank God the goblin is your younger sister. Pardon me? It it indeed an honor for us and the domain of Shimanaka to serve you... ...here in Seta Village, which you have chosen to spend your convalescence. I am abashed that we only manage to serve you with our local cuisine. However, we have brought forth the local sake that is the pride of the village. Please do enjoy yourself. Dono. My younger sister has come back. Everything is thanks to you, Dono. Yuu, please come forward to greet Dono. Dono is in front of you. Goblin... As if I am going to squat down. We do not know when he will draw out his sword. Like what that man did? Father is no longer here. Brother, please pour some wine. More wine, please. Everyone, please enjoy the food. - Bring some wine! - Well, please go ahead. It is a beautiful horse. It was born in the mountain and grew up with me. It gallops through the wind. How about the village? I can't let it run during daybreak here. Do you want to go to the mountain? Mother does not like it. Guide me around the mountain. Then you can go, right? Seta. It is such a pity for your mother. Why would you say that? Her daughter who grew up in the mountain cannot get used to the village. There is nothing like that. If touched by Mother's kindness, Yuu will most likely change. Even if it might take a long time, It is the heart of the mother who spares thoughts for the child that brings the child up. Try saying it one more time. Pardon me? You said that it is the heart of the mother who spares thoughts... ...for the child that brings the child up? Yes. So if such a mother is non-existent... ...the child will not grow up? Dono. I do not know why such a thing would irk you, Dono. Is that something people like you can understand? Dono... What is going on? - Dono! - Dono! Please stop. With a conduct such as this, you will disappoint your father. You would even brandish your sword towards this Enokido? Dono. You must understand this yourself. You are just being spoiled like a fool, Dono. Dono. Please somehow... ...put your sword back. Shut up. Shut up! You would not understand. Shut up. Shut up... Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I have come to pick you up. I shall guide you around the mountain. Let's go. Would you have beheaded him had I not come? I do not know. Because of your illness? You... Have you ever seen an illness like mine before? No clue. I have not spoken to the villagers. To you, how do I look as a man? Am I a Dono? Or... ...am I just a fool crippled by an illness? Neither of them. You are yourself. How is this? Look! Yuu. What is there inside the mountain? The charcoal-covered hut... ...that Father and I lived in. How about even deeper? The place that transcends the mountain. No clue. I have never gone there. Father did not allow me to go. Perhaps there is even an ocean. Ocean? Yeah. I want to go there someday. Yuu. What are you doing? Why avoid the rain? It feels really good. Life at the village is suffocating! You too, cry out. Me too? Anything is fine. Just shout out whatever you think. Unexpectedly timid, are you not? I hate the village! Father! Father is an idiot! Liar! Father is an idiot! Father, you are a liar! Father is an idiot! I don't want to wear tight socks! The castle should just burn itself! Yuu. Will you not come to Edo? Are there mountains in Edo? Where there is no mountain, I will not stay. What a mysterious tree. Yeah. Father said... ...when this tree was struck by thunder, that was also when I was born. I have always believed that. This name Rai of mine... ...seems to have disappear to somewhere. Raiou. Raiou? This tree's name. Since it is the sakura that bloomed due to thunder, thunder and sakura written together is "Raiou." How is it? Raiou. It is your tree. My tree... I will definitely come back to see you. Here I could only get a plain thing like this. After I come back to Edo, I will send you even more beautiful things. No. This is enough. To me, this is the most beautiful thing. Yuu... Shall you try calling them? Stronger. Try blowing into it. I will definitely come to see you. Sukejirou. Invade! Yes! Seta, what is the matter? Do not fall back! Splendid! I am defeated. What is wrong with you? I told you not to go easy on, did I not? For Seta me, even if my opponent is Dono, I would never go easy on you. Summer must have come to Seta Village as well. You have been going to the mountain a lot recently, right? Yeah. I am making charcoal. That is the only thing I know how to make. A goblin! A goblin! What is the matter...? Hey dear. Oh. Tae-sama, this... Thank you. Is it alright? You are giving me so much. We have forever been in the care of the village headman. It looks delicious. Please eat it too, O-Yuu-sama. Hmm? What is the matter? This is, this is... We are very thankful. Thank you very much. Oh dear, O-Matsu-chan. Thank you. There, there, there. How nice. The two of them were childhood sweethearts. O-Sute-san has got a bag leg ever since he was young. Hmm~ People cannot become man and wife if they are not childhood sweethearts? There is not such a thing. If Yuu has someone you love, the two of you can become like them too. Even for someone like me? That is of course. I see... Father, you seem to be in good humor. It has been a long time. Raise your head. You look good. You have grown to bear so much semblance to your mother. I do not know whether to be delighted by those words. What I could remember... ...is only the dreadful face of Mother, who was cast aside by you... ...and ended up going deranged, Father. What could you have wanted to convey to me? Yeah. The Lord of Tokugawa family in Kii Province, Lord Harufusa does not have any son. And then, he is looking for a groom for Princess Kiku. That means I would become the Lord of Tokugawa family in Kii Province? The Tokugawa family in Kii Province is the noble family that beget us with the eighth shogun, Lord Yoshimune. If one can become a lord that could be called a wise ruler, the path to becoming the shogun might even open up. You will partake in it, will you not? For the great happiness that my Lord is feeling... ...even words fail to express it. For the sake of serving under Sir Narimichi, I shall have to leave Edo together with him. For that reason, my wish to meet Brother and Mother again... ...would probably not be granted. Most importantly, I am concerned about Yuu... He indeed wrote that Dono would be going to Kii Province? Do not keep your way of speaking so insolently. But, Dono said that he would definitely come back. What will become of you if you are ever so infatuated with Dono? He promised that he would come to see me! Bear in mind your social position! There is not a single chance that Dono, who is going to... ...Tokugawa family in Kii Province, would come to see you. Yuu! Mother. What is the difference between Dono and me? What is social position? It is the fate that you have ever since you were born. What is fate? Something human strength cannot even fight against. It is unchangeable. What will happen if one disobeys fate? That... ...even I do not know. O-Yuu-san will calm her heart till the festival comes. Yuu. Do take care of yourself. Tomorrow the festival will begin. Please go with everyone. Sukejirou. Entrust... ...your life to me. Why... do have to, sir... This life we have to part, but for just a glance... I want to see Yuu. I have to see her and properly bid her farewell. Please. Dono... How is it? I am terribly sorry. His figure is nowhere to be found. Capture him no matter what. Bring him alive to me. Today, women will wear masks... ...to become a different person. All the villagers have been looking forward to this day. Please hang on, sir! Yuu. This is the place where I feel the most calm. I fixed it little by little. All by yourself? Yeah. I also make charcoal using the furnace. The sakura that... Yuu! I... ...came to part with you. You are going to be with the Princess? Why? Because of fate. If I go to Kii Province, I could not meet you any longer. If I kidnap you... ...and the two of us could stay together... Then let us do just that. Kidnap me. There is no way I could. I see. Yuu. Do stay. Stay by me. You are asking me to stay with you after you said you would part with me? I do not understand. I am suffering... ...because of you. Yuu. No need to bid me farewell whatsoever. Just go back. Go back to Edo. If it were to be me, I would kidnap Dono. I fear not anything. Like Father, I could become a criminal. Do not say that. Do not say anything. I just say what I want to say! Let go. I said let go! Yuu... Let us run away. The two of us... Yuu. I... ...want you, Dono. What would you do if anything happens to Dono? No matter what blame there is, I have prepared myself to take all of them. I did not think in the least. ...that goblin in Edo was a woman. I shall... ...take responsibility for everything. Do not forget... ...those words. Yes. The two of us could set off from here. Where are we going? The deeper place... ...where there is ocean. Keep going where we can. Till our lives give up on us. Together... Narimichi and his daughter are here. What? There are ruffians. Father. Father! Rai! Father! This is so unsightly. Though we made a deal with each other, you betrayed me yet again. Father! Do not come! You are Father? Laughable. A scoundrel like you... Why did you not follow my order to kill her that time? Why did you betray me? The life that you should have taken away twenty years ago, together with you, I will clean everything up at once. Father! Stop it! Stop it! Father. You rascals! Fa... Father. Rai. I... ...stole your life away from you. I... I was happy because I was brought up by Father. I do not resent you or anything. Sorry. Father. Why did you save me? I... ...did not save you or anything. It was you... ..who rescued me. Rai. Smile for me. Father. Why must they kill him? Why would you villagers have conflicts? Why would you samurai kill people? I do not understand. Father... Let's go back to the mountain. I want to go back. Where is Yuu? She is resting inside. You must not move yet. I do not care. Dono. Dono. Dono! Dono. Please give up on Yuu. No matter what, you are not going to give up on her? I do not care about matters like becoming the Lord any longer. You must not disobey Kubou-sama's order! Do you know what would happen if you go against him? You are more than prepared for that, are you not? That is right! I have no other way. Enokido. Pardon me. Enokido! Dono. When I met Dono... ...for the first time, you were four years old. It is so nostalgic. Please... ...become an excellent lord. Seta! You must serve... ...by Dono's side... ...forever! Enokido-sama! Manager! I... Would things have been better had I not come here? Only when I am with you, I could be my real self. Even if it was for just a short moment... However... I have to go. Yuu. I love you. Go. Father. I am not only Yuu... ...but I am also Rai. Yuu! These are? Thank you for having taken care of me. Why? This place is your home. I am not living here any longer. What I am going to do from now on... ...will only distress you, Mother. Yuu... Even though you two are apart, if you do think about each other, then your hearts are one. If you still resolve to go despite all that, I will not stop you! No matter what happens, you are still my daughter. Stop! Stop! Narimichi! I have come to pick you up. Narimichi! I have come to kidnap you! Narimichi! Show your face! Narimichi! Show your face! Dono. For the sake of your family... For Yuu... For Yuu to go on living. Narimichi! Yuu! Set off! Set off! Set off! What is the matter? Rikioumaru is... It came back? Go... Go where you want to be. Sukejirou. Open the door for me. Yuu... Sakura... Has it bloomed already? Dono... Thank you as always. Be careful. O-samurai-sama. There are only mountains ahead. If you are walking to the next village, by the time you arrive there, the sun will have already set. I know that. I am going to meet someone. In the mountains? Yeah. A peculiar woman. Someone who lived by making charcoal. What? You mean my mother? What did you just say? Mother! Mother!
