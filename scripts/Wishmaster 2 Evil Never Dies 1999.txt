IN A CASE THAT CONTINUES TO BAFFLE POLICE OFFICIALS, NATHANIEL DEMAREST PLEADED GUILTY TO CHARGES THAT HE ROBBED THE SAROM ART GALLERY... AND MURDERED TWO SECURITY GUARDS. THIS IS BULLSHIT. JUDGE EDWARD LAVWITZ REMANDED DEMAREST TO COUNTY PRISON PENDING SENTENCING. BUT QUESTIONS STILL REMAIN AS TO HOW DEMARES COMMITTED THESE CRIMES, SINCE A WEAPON WAS NEVER FOUND NOR HAVE POLICE DISCOVERED THE MISSING WORKS OF ART. AS FOR THE 3,000-YEAR-OLD STATUE DAMAGED IN THE ROBBERY, EXPERTS ARE CONFIDEN IT CAN BE RESTORED. CALLED AHURA MAZDA, IT DEPICTED AN ANCIENT PERSIAN DEITY OF THAT NAME. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. MEANWHILE, THE FAMILY OF SLAIN SECURITY GUARD ARNELL DAWES REMAIN IN SECLUSION. FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FATHER OF TWO WILL BE HELD ALONG WITH THE OTHER SECURITY GUARD.
