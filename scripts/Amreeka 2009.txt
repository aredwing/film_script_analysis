As in, you don't have a country. That's right. Where are you from? - Israel? - No, no. It's the Palestinian territory. Your occupation? Yes. It is occupied for forty years. No. What is your occupation? What--What do you do for a living, ma'am? Oh yes, I was working in banking. Is this your son? Yes. Fadi. Your husband travelling with you? No. We have divorced. My husband-- He's not a good man. Ma'am? Ma'am? Yes? Has anyone asked you to bring anything into the country? Only my mother. Are you carrying any firearms? Repeat please. Are you carrying any firearms? - Guns, weapons. - No, no. No. What's in this? Cheese and... I don't know. Meat by-products are prohibited from entry in the United States. Oh... Mama? Can you move it a little bit? Mama? Fine. Narcotics? - Sorry? - Heroin. - Cocaine, marijuana. - No! No, no, of course not! Fadi! - How are you? - Good. - Hi, Aunty. - Hello. - Welcome to America! - Thank you. It's a big country, Aunty. Mum says everyone in America is fat. So maybe you could fit in. This is my present. Michel Arona. Zatar... Fadi... Fadi! Okay, get some sleep, habib. Fadi... Fadi! So, is there anything else you can do? You can file a report, but that's about it. You can try back in a few days if you want to. Thanks. Mom... - It's my room, too. - No, it's not. Go away. You have to take an appointment. $23.24 Thanks. Thank you. Kind of ugly, but fine. Oh my God! Definitely not! What you're doing? She's telling me what to wear. Why? You don't know what to wear? No, Aunty, because he can't wear things like this. Why? Just buy this for him. Aunty, they're pleaded. Do you know what will happen if you wear this to school? What? He'll look like an FOB. - A what? - Fresh of the boat. What's that mean? What boat, habiti? It means he won't have any friends. What friends have to do with his clothes? Only everything. Arabic, English and French? Well, my French isn't that good, but-- Him parler francais trs bien. (He speaks French very well) Me too. We speak three language and a half. Mom, I only know the numbers in Hebrew. This is what I said I have. Mr. Novatski, the boys are writing on the bathroom walls again. Yeah, I'll-- I'll be there in a minute. Now, it says here you went to private school. - Yeah, I did. It was-- - Yeah, it was so expensive. But I manage. I work in a bank for ten years. Well, his record is very impressive. So you did something right. - Thank you. - I have to say that he has more credits than most of our graduates. Now, I assume that you're planning on going to college. Yeah, I do. I like arts so I thought of going to some art college or like-- No, no. He will be a doctor. Like my sister-husband. He's too smart. Right, well. Um... I see no reason why Fadi shouldn't be able to enter his junior year here. We're lucky to have him. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you! Habibi! Come on, people. Who read the assignment? They targetted aliens with ties-- C-- Come in. Fatty Farrah? It's Fadi. Isn't that what I said? I take it that's your mom. Dude, check it out. Have a seat. Welcome to Current World Issues. I'm Mr. Jones. Where you joining us from? - Louis Bank. - He's my cousin. So what's your take on what's going on over there? Well, there needs to be an end to the occupation first of all and-- We want to hear what Fatty thinks. Yeah... Fatty. Well, I guess I agree with Sanma. - Muna Farrah. - Yeah. I'm she. - Hi. Hi. - Hello. Right this way. Thank you. Please. So what can I help you with today? I came here for a job. - Excuse me? - A job. I would like a job. I-I'm sorry. I thought you wanted to open an account. I came from Palestine. You know her? - Who? - Palestine! Is that a Jewish-speaking country? No. Arabic. I'm an Arab. Oh... don't blow the place up. I'm just kidding. Actually, we're not really hiring at this time. I have a long experience. You can see from my resume. Here. Please. Great, we'll certainly keep this on file. And also I came here because my sister-- She had account with you. I promise if you give me a job, I will open my account also here. We'll keep that in mind. Thank you. Thank you for calling... How can I help you? Hi. You look for, uh... a book-keeper? You're looking for who? I'm interested in a book-keeper job. It's written here in the newspaper. That position's been filled. Hmm... Thank you. No fair. Your parts are much bigger than mine. I'm older, so live with it. Aunty, Lamis won't let me leave this part of the room. I can't even get to the door! Is it true, Lamis? - No, I was just kidding. God! - No, she's not. She's gonna put the tape back there when you leave. No, she won't. She's a good girl. Tattle-tail. Mama... Mom! Can I have lunch money, please? Lunch money? American marines have dragged the iconic statue of Saddam Hussein - off its pedestal... - So what does this mean? Is it over? Are you kidding? It's just the beginning. The Americans are going to get in there and destabilize the whole region. Mom, this is disgusting. Mom, I love it! Just push the cauliflower aside. That's what I do. It all tastes so good. You're too thin. Where's my mom, by the way? So what-- Are the Iraqis happy that Saddam is gone? I'll give you some particular advice if you don't like the way it was done. Can I get up? I can't hear! I got a job. - Where, Aunty? - In the United Alliance Bank. What will you be doing? Working in office. Administration. When do you start, Mom? When you start-- - Then bye. - Bye. Hi. Can I help you? I wish. Good morning. It's my first day. - Wait-- You work here? - Yes. I'm Muna. Matt. Matt? Your name is Matt? Do you know what it means in Arabic? I know it's not "God is great" but it's what I am. It means dead. You are dead. Cool. Imagine that someone invaded America, alright? And then the people resisted... Would we be terrorists? No. See that's completely different, though. - No, it's not. - It is because we wouldn't blow ourselves up killing innocent people. Because you wouldn't have to. Alright, because you have fighter jets in your backyard. We didn't invade them. We were over there trying to help them. How? By starving them? By killing them? My brother is over there trying to give them a chance - at freedom. - If you believe that, I seriously feel sorry for you. - You seriously feel-- - Okay. Okay. Let's open this up. What do the rest of you think? What are the reasons behind terrorism? Political injustice and resistance to occupation. Just give someone else a chance, okay? Fadi. - You would ask him. - I'm sorry. What? What was that? It seems Salma would rather I refrain from questioning Fadi. Probably cause he's got something to hide. Yeah, well, maybe he's planning to blow the school up. - Hey, that's enough. - That's so racist. What, so you think they taught him to build bombs in the second grade? Yeah, you people are clueless. - Really? - Okay, okay, that's enough. Let's get back on track. Somebody else. Come on. Welcome to the White Castle. Would you like a case of graving? No, it's... "Would you like to try our crave case?" This what I say. - You're such a fat pig! - Fuck off! Why they aren't at school? Let's just stick with "Welcome to White Castle." I'm sorry, there's no one here named Muna. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I mean, if you want, I can ask. - But I'm pretty positive. - Yes, please. - What's your name? - Raghda. - I beg your pardon. - Ra-ghda. Rag-dha? - Yes, Ragdha, yes. - I'm sorry I'm late. - Muna. - I was in the store to buy some medicine. I have a headache. Maybe too much thinking. - You were here this morning. - Yes. Muna, my name is Muna. See you tomorrow. Thank you. I don't care. But you don't listen. You know that. Nabeel. Nabeel! - Hello? - Momma? Muna! Nice! They couldn't even spell it right. Nelson... I make more than this. Taxes, Muna. That much for taxes? I see hungry people. One minute, please. Listen, it's a big problem for me. I need the money now! Maybe I can take an advance. Nelson... We should really teach the guy a lesson, then. We should kick his ass. Being anti-warrior, you're kinda violent. But yeah, we should definitely kick his ass. - What do you say? - No. It only make Mike more pissed off. I think we should give him a dose of his own medicine, you know? Yeah, man. You gotta stop being so nice. Toughen up, you know. Show those guys who's boss. How? You okay? You were good enough. First learn how to smoke a joint. I smoked one... one before. Sort of. Okay, not really. But I thought about it. Dude, you need some major help. Take off that jacket. - Why? - Just take it off. You look horrible. Just take it off. Untuck your shirt. Yeah. Oh, I got something! I got something. You gotta wear your shit loose, you know? Okay. Like you don't give a shit. Okay. Try this one. I like that. - Yeah. - It's nice? It's alright. Try that, though. - Nice! - That's perfect. It's perfect. - Yeah? Hardcore, like this. - Yeah. Yeah, like you know shit. - Go, Fadi. Go, Fadi. - Go, Fadi. Oh, yeah. I'm keeping one beside the door. And one beside my bed. Who plays baseball? Mom... Does Dad live in the basement now? Well, please stop laughing. - I'm not the one laughing. - You're the one laughing! She steals all the covers in bed. She's like Godzilla in the... in the bedroom. Moms-- they have some love in their... - Yeah. - ...their hearts. Dude, man, I'm messed up. You say "dude" too much, man. You're all American and shit. Dude, you sleep with your mom? Yeah, I've been... - It's not cool. - Cause that shit will mess you up. - Seriously. Dude, I'm just saying. - Why do you always care about sex? - It will mess you up. - What do you think about in your head? Or what do you care about? Number one, sex, number one... Cheeseburgers, number two. Double with bacon... Hey! You came from sex. Dude, I don't wanna have it in me. I don't wanna have it. Yo, guys. Check who's here? - Who's here? - Mike. Oh, shit. Are you serious? - Okay. - I hate that guy. - Seriously. - Yeah, me too. Do you guys wanna have some fun? I feel I don't think it's a good idea. What if someone sees us? Who cares? Hurry up, someone's coming. Run! Go, go, go, go, go! You're dead now. You're dead now, you fuck. "Opportunity"... "Click here to show"... Work from home. Achieve your dreams! Lose weight... earn a living. The herbalist respect. Oh so um... my mom heard me talking to James on the phone and she like, totally fucked up. So don't even mention his name, alright? Where have you been? Oh my God. Jesus! Mom, what are you doing? Where have you been, Aunty? We're so worried. Oh, we just went to a movie. Who went with you? No one. It was just us two. With James. He wasn't there? You are grounded one month. What?! This is ridiculous! Aunty, Jim is a friend of mine. Drinking with drugs, or God knows what. God, is that all you think that people do here? - Yes. - Well, here's a shocker, Mom. We live in America. We're American! As long as you live in this house, you live in Palestine! You're delusional! Fadi... Then don't. Because you snore. Then go sleep and get out of my grill. Since now. I'm homeless. - It's your home. - It's Mum and Dad's home. I have no control over it. Lamis doesn't want me in her room and I'm sick of living with someone who doesn't want me. - She wishes I was never born. - No, no, it's not true. Why don't you come back with me to your room? It's your room now. We can share it. Fadi's just sleeping at the couch. Come on. Welcome to White Castle. How can I help you? I'll have the... number four with chicken wings. And diet coke. You like to lose weight? Excuse me? You like me... We're fat in the middle. You need this... Herbal Lose. You know, we need help at the grill. You gotta pay for what you did, bro. I don't need this. - Man, I don't want to fight with you, okay? - You want to fight with me? Well, you should have thought of it before you messed with my truck! I didn't mess with your truck! Hey, Muna. There's someone here for you. I'm sorry to bother you. Your sister's at the bank. - Yes? - I told here you were out to lunch. I hope that's okay. She said your son got into some trouble at school. One minute, okay? What happened? Well, he got into a fight. There's some... bruising but I don't think it's too bad. Some asshole. Why did they beat you in? Up, Mom, up! Up, in... Just... don't worry about it. It's my problem. And you are my problem. I don't want to be your fucking problem. Fadi, have some respect. Nothing. Just... don't want to be here. Home. Just somewhere where people aren't stupid enough to think I'll blow myself up. Who said that? Can I go to class now? Yeah, sure. You're alright? You need a ride? No, thank you. I'm looking for my sister. She said she have to pick up the dry-cleaning. And I'm too late for work. Well, my car is right here. No, no. Thank you, no. Why don't you let me drive you? - It's no trouble. - No, no. I'll wait... Please. Come on, I'd be happy to. Come on. Thank you. Got a whole mess in there. Don't worry. You know... I think you're seeing the worst of it, Mrs. Farrah, I really do. Kids just don't know any better. You know, they hear about one Muslim extremist... Suddenly, all Muslims are extremists. - But they are not. - Of course, they're not. We are not Muslim even. I'm sorry. I-- I just assumed. It doesn't matter. We are a minority here and a minority there. I can relate. Not many Polish-Jews around here. You are a Jewish? - You came from Poland? - Well, not me. My grandparents. I was born here. So... you play chess? Yeah. Every now and then. I was on the chess team in college. You know we invent the chess? - "We?" Who's "we?" - The Arab. - Really? - Yeah. No, I had no idea. Yes, Oni said, "Checkmate-- It comes from the Arabic." Sheikh matt. Which means the king is dead. - Is that right? - Yes. I never heard that before. Sheikh matt. - Sheikh matt. - Sheikh matt. So you speak the Arabic without knowing that. Thank you so much. Oh, you tell Fadi to hang in there. He will. He's lucky to have you, you know. You tell him this before God this day. Thank you. They make a good hamburger here. You know why? They cook it on top of the onion. - It's delicious. - I can bring you more! Oh, no, no, no. Thanks. This is plenty. No, no, it's okay. You can take it for your family. No. I live alone. I'm divorced. Yeah, me too. I was married for eleven years. And my husband-- All what he brings me is a headache. Would you like some? No, no, no. No, it's okay. I just started my diet today. I take Herbal Loss. It's good! - Do you like it? - Yeah, it's-- It's good. You can have more. - I sell it. - I'd love to buy some. - Really? - Yeah! I mean, I could stand to lose a few pounds. You can buy it all! So... what happened to your marriage? Well, he just found another woman. I am gone. He look like this. She made me look so fat. You're not at all fat. Thank you. L-- Listen. I wish you don't say anything to my family you see me here. I won't say a word. They will not like it. I don't like it too. I have two degrees in ten years experience and in this country, all this get me is... a hamburger. Everything okay with your son? Oh, yeah. Okay. They gave him a black eye. I'm sorry to hear that. I wanted to let you know I looked into a credit card for you, - like you asked. - You did? I found one that you qualify for, but the APR is kind of high. - It's okay. - Well, great! Come on back and we'll see if we can get you approved. Thank you. Please... I don't speak much these days. Please don't... Accidental bombing... We have to live our life. I start to believe Raghda was right. To go where? It was successful. Yani, don't worry. I will help you with that. But I need you to do something for me. Sorry. Okay... - We put a little bit tahini. - Come on! Next time, I will make it with Arabic salad. - Okay. - Tomato... cucumber... Yeah, yeah. - This is good stuff. - I told you. Seriously though, you can add something here. Must be like... White Castle's New Falafel Burger! - Oh yeah. - Yeah. - For vegetarian, why not? - Yeah. So, how you say 'delicious' in Arabic? - Zaki. - Zaaki? Well, that is so zaaki. Cheers! Why you do like this? Why, you don't like it? No, I like it. I don't know. I guess I think it's cool. Makes me different. You like to be different? Well, yeah. Like why would I want to be just like everybody else, you know? It's what I hated about high school. It's that... you're punished if you don't fit in. It's stupid. It's why I dropped out. You dropped from school? Yeah, it's not a big deal though, like, I'm still gonna get my GED. It's-- I don't want to go to high school. It's too much of bullshit. Don't-- Don't fuck me like that. I can't go to my uncle-- Two cheeseburgers... Hey. Hey, um... How's your son? You know my son? Yeah, I know-- Yeah, I know everybody knows Osama. - Nice one! - $8.99. Tell your son that I said hi. Take your food and go away. This is a free country. I don't have to go anywhere. - Why don't you get out of here? - Go back where you came from, okay? You guys just go. You shut the hell up, faggot. Shame on you. Have some respect. Go away from here. I will call the police now. Go away! Go! Go! I said go! Jesus! Are you okay? Muna? Okay, I see a van. Does he drive a van? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, here, here. Why didn't you call the ambulance? I tried. She wouldn't let me. It's okay. I don't have any... No, no, no, no! Just relax and stay where you are. I'm going to check a few things. Okay. They said they know my son. - You have any tingling? - No. - How about now? - No. Wallahi, it's not a big deal. I don't know. I'm stupid, tayyib. Mama, you're not stupid! Don't say that. Tayib, it doesn't sound like you have anything to do with this. - Can you turn on your side? - Yeah, okay. Okay. Does this hurt? This might hurt. The muscles on the side of your spine are in spasm... Where should we take her to the hospital? It's okay. If it's not better in the morning, I'll take you to the hospital for an X-ray. Okay. Muna, let's get you out of here. Nice and slow. Okay. Yallah. - Okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Thank you, Matt. No problem. Matt. - Good night, Muna. - Bye! You feel better. Thank you. Easy, easy. Don't worry, you'll be okay. Keep the ice full. Ten minutes, tayyib? Okay. - Good night. - Good night. Aunty, do you really work at White Castle? Could have at least chosen Wendy's. - Night. - Good night. Can you take me somewhere? Hey, hey, hey. Hey, what are you gonna do? I don't know. Is Mike here? Mike. Why did you hit my mom? I don't know what you're talking about. What did I ever do to you? - Fadi! Fadi! - My mom can't walk because of you. My brother could've died because of you, you stupid... You're an idiot! You know that? You're dumb. What the hell are you talking about? Whose a terrorist? You're the one who barged in... Get off him! - You're an idiot! - I'm calling cops. Asshole! Aunty... Aunty, Aunty, Aunty, Aunty, Aunty... Aunty, Fadi was arrested. No, no, he's okay. He went to... He went to Mike's house. And, um, they called the cops. It wasn't his vehicle. He was the guy who was at White House earlier. Look, Aunty, okay... You can't tell Mom and Dad, okay? Cause if they find out I snuck out, they're gonna kill me. What do you want me to do? Careful, Aunty. - Allah. - You okay? So I've got some news. They decided to drop the charges against your son. Where is he? We can't release him yet. We still need to hold him for questioning. - Why? - It's procedure. Can I see him? No, not right now. Well, how long is he gonna be? I really couldn't say. Maybe you can try back again in the morning. - In the-- - In the morning?! I'm sorry. It's out of my hands. Ya Allah! We have to call your parents. What? No, no, no. Okay, listen... They're not listening to us, alright? There's no way that they're gonna listen to Mom and Dad. We have to get some help here, Aunty, okay? I can't leave my son here. - I'm sorry if I bothered you. - No, no. No, no bother. Don't worry, we'll-- We'll get this straightened out. - You alright? - Yeah, thank you. Okay. Mr. Novatski. What's going on? This woman's son was brought in a few hours ago on assault charges. Right, and the charges were dropped. Not exactly. Because of the nature of the complaint, - we have to investigate further. - So investigate, but why my son have to stay here? Look, I know these boys very well. - I'm sure you do, Mr. Novatski. - Just they're having a hard time getting along with each other, but that's it. It's nothing that requires any further investigation. We're dealing with some serious accusations, sir. No, they're not accusations. They're just-- They're silly rumours started by kids who have no idea what they're saying. We'd love to take your word for it, but we take this sort of thing extremely seriously. I mean, I don't have to tell you what's going on in the world. I understand that, but you're making a big mistake here. This is a 16-year old boy. I mean, he's harmless. Like I said, this is a special circumstance. Cut the crap! This is no special circumstance. This is a boy trying to defend his mother. He presents no threat to anybody. If I'm-- If I'm wrong, you... you can hold me personally responsible. Salma. This-- This just sucks. Sorry, Mom. Hello. Welcome to the White Castle. What are you craving? Don't look at me. I don't want any of this. I just want a cheeseburger. - Me too! - I'll have one too, Mom. - Not before dinner! - Yeah, Raghda, you are so strict. They are not. You will see. - Hi! - Hi. You work today. Thank you. Ah, very good! You are getting better. - Hello. - Oh, Mr. Novatski. Please, call me Stan. I just, uh... I'm just here to pick up some food. Stan, it's too bad I can't sit with you. - We are going to eat. - Oh, well. - Have a good time. - Thank you! Why don't you come with us? No, no, I-- I couldn't. It's better than the White Castle. Come on! Oh, you will like it. Come on! It's very kind of you. I'm just gonna come and say hello. - No, it's okay. - That's fine. - Hi, I'm Mr. Novatski. - Hi! Hi. - Nice to see you. - Yeah. Nice to see you. Please come and eat with us. Arabic food-- - It's the best in the world. - No, I can't. - I-- The best in the world. - Yalla, yalla. - You sure there's room? - Yes, yes. Welcome. All right. But why are they all eating cheeseburgers? Do you like Arabic music? I like this. If you like it, you have a good taste. Okay. What happened to your diet, Aunty? You gotta stay strong. - No, no, eat it. - I will. I will. How is it? See... Herbal here. Um, just inhale. Yes, yes, yes. Keep it, keep it, keep it... Where did it go? Revision: Dny238
