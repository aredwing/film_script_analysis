Can I sit here? Yes. First 48 hours are hard Very hard Yeah I saw you outside the ICU Shouting at Dr. Vishvvanath... Your husband? Car accident? Brain injury? YUP Brain injury is tough... But survival chances are better with young, healthy patients So, my husband is going to be okay, right Doctor? No... No! I mean, I am not a Doctor Oh... My wife is here... She has been in a coma for last eight months Shit! So... have you met your doctor yet? No... they said... only after the morning ward rounds... Famous morning ward rounds!

'The net 48 hours will be crucial' Yeah... that Vishwanath guy... he already said that... They say it to each other I think... They all just ape each other So what am I supposed to do now? You do what we all do Wait! Wait! Your husband has had a serious head injury... He has a fractured shoulder... and three broken ribs... ...but, it's the brain injury that is most dangerous... We shouldn't raise our expectations too much Because in most cases like this chances of a complete revival are... ...slim at the best We are getting a new scan today to see hovv things are progressing... But we need to wait for the full result of that In the meanwhile, the first 48 hours are going to be crucial ls Rajat going to die? We will do our best to make sure that he doesn't Mrs. Deshpande, I think you should call your friends or family over... You need all the support you can get And if you want to talk to me, you are most welcome at any time Yeah Sonal... "You are okay with lentils tonight right?" No man, not that lentil curry again please. Everything alright? Come on. Eat something. Eating, sleepinQ and bathing These three things should never stop If you stop these then... everything will come to a stop... Come on This ldli is not as bad as it looks! What's your name? Shiv Natraj... But after living in the South for over three decades now... ...it has become 'Shiva Natraja'! I don't mind though... I'm Tara. Huh? Tara... Kapoor Well, Deshapande, recently Tara Deshpande. Here, keep that! Drugs? Sleeping pills! They are perfectly harmless. Just take one in the night So I should just pop a pill and doze off happily while Rajat is in the ICU?! I can't Look! While Rajat is in the ICU the nurses are looking after him, not you When he comes out of it, is when he will be needing your maimum support... You must look after yourself... Looking after yourself is looking after Rajat. You make it sound like it's an Alcoholics Anonymous Meeting Not so different actually... Here come... Come on. You must eat.

'We are so good together' 'Keep the champagne chilled baby' Champagne... yeah I read that... Hovv many messages in two days?! 32! I know it. He came to Cochin just to meet her This pitch business was just an ecuse! Look, maybe you are over-reacting. Perhaps they are just good friends... 'Good friends'? Yeah right! If she were really such a good friend... ...then hovv come she did not attend our wedding... this bitch! So why don't you call her? Just call her! Who, this Sheetal bitch? And what would I say?

I'm an atheist No Problem... we will pray for you Ma'am Sheetal is a man! Yeah, I heard... And he has a big beard too. I am such an asshole. Iam a dick! I am a dick! You know Pankaja... if we ever had children... ...perhaps it would be as difficult to understand them as this girl... Today's generation... they are just incredible... They just blurt out anything that crosses their mind... Yes, I did say once, that they are more evolved than us... They understand the world better than us, they are better informed etc etc But they lack any grace or dignity You can't just vomit out anything that comes into your head It's quite embarrassing! Yes, okay I will stay away from her Too much drama anyway. You can't just walk in here like this Ma'am! I have to change his IV Please go and wait in the waiting room Baboon! Where the hell have you reached? You are not answering your phone and Rajafs is switched off too! Everyone's here. I have served the starters already... Where are you Tara? Ish. Rajat has been in an accident... It's really nice. Just have a sip Accident? What are you saying? Who? He is okay right? He is in a hospital here in Cochin In Cochin? Rajat? He has had a severe head injury. He is in a coma. Coma? Listen I'm coming there right away... I'll take the first flight in the morning and I'll be there okay... I have to leave for San Francisco in the morning... Shit. Tara, Dileep has a flight to San Francisco, in the morning tomorrow... Tell her, I'm calling my Cochin office right now... Dileep is calling his Cochin office Tara... Ish! - I will call Pushkar and ask for... I think Rajat is going to die No, my Tara. My love Only positive thoughts, okay Listen. You just... you just start chanting okay? You saw it right you know hovv much it helped me when I was pregnant And I'm going to start chanting for Rajat right away... okay... Everything is... Good evening Uncle Oh... Good evening... Madam has sent tiffin... Thank you! Thank you! Your Madam is very kind I'm getting fat Uncle. Old tiffin boxes? Oh yes! I will just get it... And also, hovv is Aunty? Aunty is fine. She will be home soon. Doctors are very happy... Uncle! Doctor Nirupam wants to talk to you... I can't deal with his negativity What Uncle... Good afternoon Sir Tara Deshpande? One second sir.. Is everything okay? Just shut the door and come in. You are feeling alright? No! What happened? Nothing happened Why are you still in bed? Come on get up. Your phone is ringing... You are in a really bad mood today Lokesh. 31 calls. Seems really determined to speak to you. Fuck that Lokesh! Fuck all of them! You know when that CHOIVIU was down with jaundice... It was me who was up all night, taking him to the hospital. ...cleaning his puke... hovv he used to call me his soulmate, that ass! And Ish! My best bloody friend! At the time of her wedding, you know I was the only one supporting her... ...helping her tide through... her relationship problems, her OCD... ...and now she is fobbing me off with some 'Stay Positive' shit! The net time someone tells me to stay... fucking positive, I will... Do you know Shiv hovv many friends I have on my Facebook? 1457! And I get 250 'Likes' on some random jackass selfie! And do you know hovv many followers I have on Twitter! 5,800! And hovv many of them are here right now? Zero! What is Twitter? Twitter. ...? It's like this... thing... It's like this... notice board... Ecept that it is online and open to the public... So you can just write any shit on it... And then other people write back some comments... ...and sometime shitty things too! Well, the basic idea is to get more and more people to follow you Ya? Ya. What is the point? I don't know what is the point... Shiv... I want to tell you something I haven't told about Rajat to my parents yet... And neither to Rajafs mom... The thing is that she is so much into Astrology and all that shit... I know she hates me already She will blame me only for his accident. According to me, you are better off not sharing it with them Really? Yeah... after all what will she do really? Ecept for crying and creating some drama, poor thing... She won't be able to help anyway This is your grief Tara. Yours alone. Yeah. I guess so Nobody else gives a shit... I\lo I give a 'Shif! Shiv, you said 'Shif! It sounds funny coming from your mouth. - Does it sound funny? - Yeah So, should I say stool? Stoooooool? Dude, hovv are you so Zen about all this? I'm at a different stage of grief from you, that's all... There are stages to this shit? Yes. First stage is Denial... Denial... It can't be happening to me. These things happen to other people... Second stage is Anger... Why did this happen to me. Why me? Why him? You hate everyone because they are not where you are... Then comes bargaining. Give and take... If you happen to believe in God... ...then you will try everything to please him... you'll bribe him... And if you are an atheist... Then suddenly you will become very spiritual... All your life, you were this completely pragmatic person... ...who may not have spared even a rupee... ...to the homeless guy at the traffic signal... But now suddenly you transform into a philanthropist... ...and feed a whole file of beggars thronging outside a religious place... Then comes depression... A dark abyss... An endless night... That is your stage. It's a very dangerous place... But then finally, comes acceptance! You are finally able to cope up with your situation... And at this stage you find yourself with two choices... One choice is to persuade yourself... That everything is going to be alright... Or give up hope, like a coward... That choice is yours! But you must be purposeful while you wait Then you become 'Zen', like me! So tell me please hovv do I get to this... net stage? First of all, call housekeeping! This is Mrs. Deshpande... A cup of Panickefis coffee everyday, keeps the doctor away... Hi Baby! Did you see Sudhakafis case? - Yes sir. And what do you think? Subarachnoid? Why do you think it's a subarachnoid? It's blood, with surrounding oedema... Very good, but why so apologetic Doctor? Because, it is very bad news sir... It is very bad news. But it's not your fault... Okay let me teach you hovv to give bad news... Watch me and try and copy? First, you must look serious but hopeful... ...then raise your eyebrows a little... and chin down... More down... Not so much... it looks like you are set for a boing match... Look at me... We are still waiting for the final reports... And we'll know more in forty eight hours... ...but... ...the latest research confirms that... ...the moon is made of some kind of dairy product... Possibly cheese! Very nice sir... And then you take them with you... just hold their elbow like this... Just for a count of two. That's it. And they are with you... Dr. Ravi there's no room for doubt here Remember, what are we trying to do here? We are trying to save lives. Right? And if a little bit of faking will make you do yourjob better... Just do it! The latest report confirms that... ...the moon is made of some kind of diary product. ...possibly cheese... Why are you dragging me here Dude? I'm a proud Atheist... Faith is a great coping device Tara. Try it! Don't vvorry. You are not swapping sides! Happy? - Yes, very good... Nam-myoho-renge-kyo Nam-myoho-renge-kyo... Nam-myoho-renge-kyo... Hovv could it just disappear? That shop used to be right here... some... ten - fifteen years back... Can't we just go to a shopping mall? No, I hate those bloody things... They represent everything that's wrong with us! Everything? - Everything! It's okay Shiv. You are not swapping sides either! Shopping is also a great coping device... Is it? Yeah! Try it! Prema, I'd like to see Rajafs charts... I'd like to see his vitals... Shiv, hovv come you never had kids... Just never happened. First, there was a bit of a medical complication. But we were so content... Never really felt the need. Forty years just passed... - For'ry years? -For'ry years! Fuck! You mean, hovv wonderful! - Yeah... You know people keep telling me, 'It's okay, she had a good life'... ...as if it's okay to die if one had a good life... So if she had a rotten life, she should have had a longer life or what? People are shit! I hate peopleg I hate people too... Good Morning Ann. Happy Birthday... Thank You Uncle... Good Morning Professor! Good morning... Even I'd like flowers sometime, you know... Professor we need to talk... I... I can't talk right now. I have to get back home. There is a problem with my bathroom... the drain has... It's high time... No... I\lo You are not being realistic - I am being realistic Everyday I hear of a new case Where the patient has suddenly recovered from coma... ...after the doctors had given up all hope It's fiction, Professor. Stuff they write in magazines! No. It's in medical journals! I was just reading about this woman in New Hampshire... She was in coma for two years and then one fine day she just woke up... ...like she got up after a night's sleep In Australia, there was this Scuba diver... Your wife has been on a steady decline for eight months now... She has no quality of life... You have to ask yourself what would she want? She would want to get better But she is not - She will! She will. You know that's not true... Every month you are spending millions of rupees... At this rate you will go bankrupt! Is that what she would have wanted? I don't know actually... we had never discussed it you know... she and I... Do you discuss this with your wife every evening... Darling, hovv long would you like to be on life support in case you slip into a coma? Please give it to me in writing, so I would know what to do... She is just another patient for you Nirupam... I know that, she is just another hospital bed... But I don't think you realise what she is for me... So I will decide what she wants! She wants to get better and if you don't want to help me... I will go to the hospital board, and I will find somebody who can! Professor? You know you are not doing this for her You think you are, but you are not... You are not afraid of her death... Actually what you are afraid of is that after her death... Your life will have to change You have to think of her Professor. Shiv! So, we have some good news... What? We repeated your husband's scans this morning... And, the swelling has started to reduce Oh wow! So does that mean, he is going to like open his eyes... ...gain consciousness and stuff? No, it's not that simple... As you can see here, the brain is less tight now See... and the midline shift is also reduced... But still there is a sizeable haematoma here in the temporal lobe... It's a blood clot, the size of a golf ball... Meaning? We need to evacuate this clot so that the brain can continue to heal We need to operate. To remove this blood clot? Yes, that and a little part of the brain, in this area... Of the brain? Yeah, it's a small area... What does this small area of the brain do? Well it takes care of the muscle control on the right hand side... And possibly higher language and speech function... if we need to resect here... Doctor, Rajat won't become a vegetable right? I think it's pointless to think like that, really... Yeah, because he just wouldn't want to depend on anyone! He is like the most self sufficient man ever... I'm sure, I'm sure Mrs. Deshpande, are you happy to press on? Press on? - To operate? Yeah... Good then, I will ask DrRavi to book the OT for Friday? Friday... Shiv... hey Shiv! Where have you been. I've been looking for you since morning! I was a bit... busy Rajafs having an operation... on Friday This Nirupam... right, he is a two faced FRAUD! That's all! Shiv? I'm sorry Tara... this is very good news about Rajat But my wife also needs an operation... ...but this bloody fellow just refuses to do it! It's a blockage of cerebro-spinal fluid flow... It's easily operable But you did tell all this to Nirupam right? - Of Course I did! But do you think that bloody know-it-all gives a damn? I have probably read more medical journals... ...than he has in his entire bloody life! Just the other day I was reading about it, in an old issue... There was a patient in Birmingham who stayed in a coma... ...despite his scan being normal Then they discovered it was mechanical arachnoiditis... Cured with a straightforward spinal decompression This was published twelve years ago! But I don't think this fellow has read anything... ...since he passed out of college! Yeah... but I guess he is just doing his job... You know all these doctors... ...they are all puppets of the Insurance companies... Once they figure that the patient is some sity year old hag... ...they would rather let her die Anyway- What did he say about Rajat? They said they need to remove a bloodclot... the size of a... football... Oh come on... - A golf ball - A golf ball Yeah... Yeah they are right. The surrounding tissues need space to heal... Correct. Your favourite Nirupam had the same thing to say... Great then, at least one of us is getting the right treatment That's the thing Shiv... I can't be sure if this operation is really the right decision for Rajat... No, no! It is the correct decision They have to remove the clot in order to deal with the haematoma I know! But there is just no way to ascertain... ...what kind of life he will come to after the surgery And if there is no quality of life... ...l'm not sure if Rajat would have wanted this... Hovv do you know? Did he ever tell you? That in case I slip into coma, get me operated only on the condition... ...that my quality of life would be great! What the hell you are talking about Tara? Quality of life? Life is life... I know Rajat okay... I know that he would have preferred... ...a quick dignified death rather than a long suffering life... Hovv do you know? Because you know what he wanted for our honeymoon? Trek to Ivlachu Pichu! A Sunday afternoon meant tennis for two hours straight! And he would go running ten kilometres not less than thrice a week! These days Medical Science has the power to cure everything Tara... Oh is it now? Coming straight from the fountain of... profound medical knowledge! By the way, which year did you eactly get your medical degree in? Yeah I didn't attend any Medical college and ain't I glad! I have never met a single doctor in my life with any bloody morality! Look at you. Sounding like a completely... delusional... What. ..'? Say it now! Delusional old... fool. Say it! But I know what Pankaja wants... ...because I have lived with her for forty years You and your bloody 'forty years' shit You think your marriage is so much more precious ...than mine because it dragged on for so long? It didn't drag on. Alright. It did not drag on! It lasted. Because we cared for each other. Not like you... Young people... 'Not like you young people' Okay you tell me what is there to be afraid of a bloody operation... What exactly is scaring you? That the Rajat you got married to, that Rajat will not come back? Right, he may not be the same Rajat, so what, he will bloody live! Courage, patience, nothing you young people have... All you want is the easy way out! Become a bloody widow! Mourn for si months and get on with your bloody life... Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! You know nothing about me or my husband or our relationship... Then why are you trying to kill him? I'm so fucking done with you! So am I! No! No! We are behaving just like newly weds I know! We should be bored of each other by now, right? It's been like si weeks... And one day. Doctor Ravi, will it be painful? What? The operation? We will give him Anaesthesia... But will the operation work? I mean will he still be able to do the things that he loves... like, play tennis or run marathons or even walk? Mrs Deshpande it's too early to say... we need to... ...'We need to repeat the scans and the net 48 hours will be crucial' Yes Yes Will you tell me the truth? Doctor please... The truth is, Mrs. Deshpande... I don't really know if he'll be able to play tennis or walk or... whatever... But, I think... ...probably not. It is not going to be easy. Thank you. Thank you for being honest. I am sorry She was alone at home when she had the stroke... If we had gotten her to hospital, her condition would have been better... ...but I had gone out to see a bloody cricket match. By the time... Yeah. I know Sir. I am very sorry for Ma'am. If you are sorry then please help me - Sir... She needs the operation. And the hospital won't do it because they think I don't have the money. Sir, your house is already mortgaged. And your overdraft is very high. If you don't mind me saying sir, you should ask your family member to help. Vishnu Ivlurali Nair. My wife is my only family. Please help me. Are you hungry? Okay we are taking you to the canteen. Calm Down. We are going to the canteen. Don't worry... ...the Doctor will come and give you injection the pain will come down Don't cry. It will be all okay soon... Canteen... Calm down... It will be all okay soon... I told you the Doctor will make okay Canteen... Listen, my hottie! I love you! Tara Ma'am. You came? So good. I have been praying here everyday for Rajat Sir. Take some offering. No, Thank You. Ish! Oh my God! Baboon! What a rude girl you are! You have not answered a single call of mine. I just couldn't take it anymore. I just handed the kids to Dileep and came here. I'm so glad you are here. Yeah, I'm here. I can't wait to meet Rajat. I'm going to pass all my positive energy to him. By the way I have started chanting like you said... You did?... Good girl! Yeah... so... they will take Rajat for a... Let me take you to a spa... oh sorry... There is a blood clot in Rajafs brain... ...and they are going to remove it... they want to operate on him. Why can't they use these clot busting drugs? I don't know... I have read about it somewhere. Let me just google it. Clot busting drugs... you know... it's like they give you an injection... ...and it dissolves your blood clots like magic... in seconds. It's for people with like strokes and heart attacks... Probably they can't use it on Rajat or they would have suggested it right? I bet it's because it's too expensive... Have you spoken to your insurer? No... Tara. You don't know your insurer? Look I'm sure the doctors know their shit. The doctors now a days are only interested... ...in mooching maimum money off you, not to cure you! Oh... -V\/hat...? In trauma cases they avoid using clot busting drugs. It's too risky. Mrs. Deshpande, you can come now. Full Cochin girl you have become. Baby. lsh is here. He can hear you? I don't know Hey Rajat. We are all praying for you, okay... Dileep and kids miss you a lot. In fact, Dileep has stopped playing tennis without you. Enough now Rajat... Just get the hell back and get up now! And quickly tell us what is the net best TV show to watch! Homeland Season 4 has also started now. Come on! ...and repeat this guy one more time okay, and all of them... Doctor can I just have five minutes with you... I'll just. -l'll call you. Whatever time, I'll be there. Doctor, I have come across at least fifteen more cases... Please come in. ...where spinal decompression was administered... ...and more than half the cases there was at least a marginal improvement... Professor... - This is.. You have to stop this. Please. Doctor my wife needs a spinal decompression surgery Why don't you understand? Surely it's not the most complicated procedure in the world... Why don't you read about this case... You don't think I know this case? I have written for some of these journals, Professor. I have been doing this for twenty years. You have to trust me. But you must empathise with me too. This procedure can't make her any worse than she is. But I know why you are not doing it. It's the hospital board which is possibly pressurising you... ...to shut my case since they think it's a hopless case... Don't waste time on it. Is there no end to greed? Okay, can I just say something. Your wife is my responsibility. I decide what is best for my patients not the board - Then... I decide... please! Hovv many times will I repeat myself. There is no surgery in the world which will revive your wife. It will only cause her more pain. Is that what you want to do? Alright then whatever you may say, but one way or another... I will save her. I promise you that. Professor, this is not the way. I am not moving from here. Poor gUY! Yeah... his wife has been in coma for over ten months now. He thinks she needs an operation... ...but the hospital wants to disconnect her ventilator. What nonsense! Hovv can the hospital decide! He should decide! His wife has every right to live. Live and do what! I mean, she probably will never wake up. If he desires so, then the hospital must operate. He must have paid shit loads of money already. You can't do this! I'm not moving! Let go! Hey! You want my wife to die and give the room to somebody else. To some rich people! See! I told you it is about the money. My heart goes out to him. Ish! Ya? I want to ask you something. What happened baboon! You be strong about this. And the thing is I'm with you on this. And I'm here, okay. Yes get the car keys, I will be down in three and a half minutes. 9K8)'- Sir, Mrs. Deshpande wants to see you Saumya, not today... please tell her tomorrow. Sir, she is insisting... Doctor I'm really sorry to force my way... ...in so late but I really have to speak to you. It's okay. Come in please. This is my friend lshita... Have a seat. What can I do for you? Well, I have changed my mind. I don't want Rajat to have this operation. Sorry? What? I just... I don't want to subject my husband to any more pain. Your husband is a young and healthy man... It will be stupid to not give him this chance, really. I discussed it at length with my friend, and I have made up my mind. I don't want this operation. And who do you think you are to decide that. And what do you think this is... ...some 'Who wants to be a Millionaire' quiz show? Where phoning a friend will get you the right answer? You know I am the doctor here, not her! Your husband has a very good chance to get better. And I will ensure that he gets that chance. He is her husband. And you can't force her to, okay? You know that's the problem with you rich people. You take medical treatment for granted. Go and see sometime, the state of poor people... ...outside a government hospital... ...who sell their lands and homes and everything they ovvn... ...and sleep on road side... ...only to ensure that their loved ones get a chance to live. You guys are sitting in a state-of-the-art hospital... ...vvith five star amenities, and you think you know about pain? You have no idea, I'm sorry! Yeah maybe I have no idea but I know my rights, doctor. Mrs. Deshpande, you can take your rights and do what you want with them. I know my job. And I will make sure I do what I have to do. Wow. What an asshole. Oh my God. What's this? And hovv I thought that after retirement... ...we will always spend time together... ...and look at you, deserting your pretty wife on a Saturday night ...for that silly cricket match... Hovv dare you! Is it a girl? ls she pretty? Hey, come on... you know I don't have any secrets from you... Ah... tell it to the Pope! Put that book down now. Get ready. Hey, remember this... Oh... the blue glitter you wore at my wedding! Feels like another lifetime... You remember hovv Rajat made us down all those shots? And then that... disaster... Lokesh! Dropped the entire bag of mushies in the sea... Went into the sea looking for it for five hours... And missed your wedding in the process. Fucker he didn't even come once... Actually, Cochin is kind of out of the way... Oh please! It's not Brazil exactly. It's only a two hour flight Even if they don't come, they still care. 9K8)'- They do! Yes Mummy! Your phone is always ringing, you know that? Oh shit! You didn't have to drop me. I could have walked. Sorry! Don't be sorry. Dileep is so worried. Aryan has never had such high fever ever before. And I have also not been away like this. Aryan should be your priority. In fact I am feeling a bit guilty. I will be back soon okay, I promise. Thank you for coming. Bye. Bye. Wait. - What? I have got to tell you something. What? Because I am a mother I know hovv it feels.. ...l think you should inform Rajafs mother now.. Oh no, I can't believe you of all people. ...you know what Rajafs mother is like. But she is his mother. And she has every right to know. In fact you should be sharing this with your parents too. You need their support. You know what, lsh, I know you have Aryan and Ayesha. ...and you are this great mother with a super hectic life.. ...and I have understood that I'm not your priority. Okay don't exaggerate now. And I'm sorry I couldn't come earlier. But you should just forget all this and just focus on being positive.. ...and having the faith. Stop this patronising shit. I'd like to see your positivity. ...if Dileep or Aryan were on ventilator instead. All this positive energy will disappear in a minute Have faith! Have faith! To hell with your 'Have faith' bullshit! You always had so much advice to offer. Now would be a really good time. I don't know what I am supposed to do. I really don't know. Pankaja, all of those times I told you that I have had no secrets from you.. I was not telling the truth. Pankaja. '.- 1984 December. We had this major college reunion celebration. ...you had refused to come and.. ...vvish I hadn't gone either. Rohini was there. You remember her? History Honors. Long hair. Nose ring. Big bindi. Handloom sarees. Later she married that rich idiot from Delhi. Well, Rich idiot wasn't around either so Rohini and I sort of gravitated towards each other and.. We danced together and talked about old times and all that. She knocked down three or four drinks very quickly. Then we started getting a little sentimental and she began to cry.. ...so I tried to comfort her.. ...before I knew it I was holding her.. ...and one thing followed another. Pankaja if you can hear me I'm asking for your forgiveness. I know you are going to recover. I know you are going to recover. And when you do, I need you to forgive me. And if you are not going to recover.. ...l can't let you go without telling you this. It's been a weight on my heart for thirty years. I fucked up. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Come sit here. I'll be back. give me two minutes. Oye stop with the drama. please. Come and sit here.. I'm sorry. Don't be stupid. I'm sorry actually. Forget it. It's all so bloody.. ...fucked up. Bravo! You said the 'F' word! I have missed you Shiv. Just a few minutes back I realised, that you are the only person.. ...who gets me.. In a country of one billion! And you don't even know what Twitter is! I know. It's a.. ...notice board. Listen. Do you think we can get some booze somewhere right now? You know when Pankaja comes out of the coma. ...first thing she is going to say is, 'why is the bathroom so dirty?' Well Rajat would just switch on the snooze button.. ...and go right back to sleep. Lucky fellow. You think people dream when they are in a coma? Maybe. I don't knovv.. Rajat you ass! You better be dreaming about me. You will never know, will you? I'm sure he is dreaming about Deepika Padukone. No.. he will be dreaming about you.. He is always ogling at girls.. Yeah? - Yeah. If we are in a restaurant. ...he will flirt with the waitress, like every time. It's not like she is going to sleep with you.. ...she gets paid to tolerate you. Men are just programmed differently. Okay please enlighten me, if you men ever pick up the wet towel after you.. ...will you be considered less manly or what? Well by the time you hit my age.. ...you wouldn't bend down for a thousand rupee note forget about the towel! Once it occurred to me that I should compare. ...the number of cosmetics between Pankaja and I in the bathroom. And I discovered that I only possess one tooth brush and one razor. While she has sity seven bottles and tubes. ...and little round things with mirrors and what not.. I don't get even an inch of space to place my razor.. ...between her numerous cream bottles. night cream, day cream. ...morning cream. all over the place. ...why doesn't anyone make a 48 hour cream man. ...it will be a great invention. So bad they are right. Very bad. Hey, this bar doesn't have any music? You like.. LPS? Oh my God, you really are old! You? Uncle, ls everything okay? We heard noise. Madam is worried.

So this is the secret of your forty year long marriage? Your sey vvife! Isn't she lovely? Hot is the word! 'Hot'! You know I read in a science fiction novel, that the future has. ...already happened in some other dimension, or whatever. So, whatever has to happen, has already happened! In our ancient scriptures, they call it Karma. Which means the operation is already. done. Ventilator is already disconnected. Shh. What? Think I just heard Pankaja's voice.. Shut up! So stupid. Don't say shit like that. True love? What does that even mean? Like I would know. You know I used to think that it's like. ...having the courage to let your loved one go.. ...or to be able to accept your partner unconditionally? In running shoes or on a wheel chain. it shouldn't matter, right. But maybe it's neither, you know. It's not our decision to make. Maybe. I'm scared Shiv.. I'm scared too.. Don't worry Tara.
