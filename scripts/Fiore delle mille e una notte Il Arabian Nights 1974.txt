She will give the best massages you've ever had: Head massages to bring sweet sleep, leg massages to make you skip like a goat. As the poet says: "The masseuse is worth more than all wise men. "She tends to the heads of kings." - Five hundred dinars! - Six hundred! Seven hundred! Did you hear, Lady of Moons? Seven hundred dinars! - Shall he own you? - I don't want a monkey-beard! I'll take her. Eight hundred! You're no good, God has only given you one eye! How dare you! You let her do that? I can't help it. Her owner has given her the right to choose her buyer. One thousand! What an offer! Will you accept this old man as your owner, Zumurrud? You have a soft candle in your pants. It rises when you sleep, and sleeps when you rise! God pity whoever lies with you! How dare you bring a slave here who ridicules us so brazenly, so irreverently, and so stupidly? I beg your forgiveness. I won't be sold to anyone but that young man. Me? He can't have any money! - You've decided? - Only he can be my owner. He has smooth cheeks and his beauty enchants me. Come on, buy this slave. She has chosen you! What are you waiting for? She's yours! Come. Take my hand, come along. Take this money. - What then? - Pay the seller, then rent a house in the district of carpenters. Not there, silly. Not like that. I don't know how to do it, you show me! Stop playing, Barsum. Come! Come, I say! Quick! Nuredin, wake up. Come here! What is it, my love? Did you stay up all night to do that? Look. Go to the market and sell it for two hundred dinars. But listen carefully. Don't sell it to a blue-eyed man. Not at any price. Understood? I fear that something will part us. I feel a shadow in my heart. Fear not, I am here. Look how beautiful this is, sir. A work of art. Who made it? A slave girl made it for me. I'll buy it. You ask me to sell my soul. I'm joking. Please take it. Two hundred dinars. I'll pay one thousand. I've been forbidden to sell it to a blue-eyed man. That's a good offer: It's more than it's worth. Very well. But stay away from me! Christian, why fellow me? ? II I ask is for something to eat. I'm starving. I have nothing. Go with God. God expects us to help each other, doesn't He? What is it? What are you reading? Listen... My eyes saw her, to my misfortune. What agony it was to leave her there. Poets of my court! Let us see if it's true that poets can speak of things they have not seen. Compose a poem that begins with these words: "My eyes saw her, to my misfortune. "What agony it was to leave her there." You! My eyes saw her, to my misfortune. What agony it was to leave her there. This gazelle which held me captive beneath the shade of two palm trees. She bathed in water from a silver vase. She saw me, and hid her charms. But they peeped through her hands. Ah, to lie with her for an hour or two! I said to two youths: "I love you". "Have you money?", they replied. And l: "Yes, I spend generously." They exclaimed: "It's a deal." Look over there. Who are those three boys? You boys! May I read some verses to you? I wrote them when I was almost as young as you. "I am old now, with all the desires of the young. "I have a passion for enjoyment, and I love men in their youth. "Oh, city of purity, we dream of nothing but sin." Now, I have a suggestion. - We're listening. - Tell us! Come to my house: I promise everything you desire. Precious wine from the monastery, lamb and all kinds of birds. Let us eat, drink, then you will take pleasure with each other, and with me, if you wish. Very well. Let's go. The greatest joy is a young drinker with handsome boys for company. One sings for him, one drinks to his health, and the other offers him his mouth to be kissed. Write a verse about us! I would give my life for the tenderness of this cheek - what bliss! Blessed be He who created the smooth cheeks of youth, and gave you this beautiful colour! While my soul remains in this tranquil village, my heart is torn between two desires: The minarets of Baghdad, and the land of the two mosques. - What is your name? - Berhane. - How old are you? - Fifteen. - Are you married? - No, and I don't ever want to be. Why? Have women hurt you? No, but books say they are treacherous. Heaven on earth is to be found on their breasts, and the moon shines on their mound. This too is written in books. But it is in their nature to betray men, whether near or far. They paint their eyes and plait their hair. They make you swallow bitter pills. Will you come to my palace? Yes, thank you, sir. - What is your name? - Giana. - How old are you? - Fifteen. - Would you like to come with me? - With pleasure. Come, let's go. You'll lose your bet, Zeudi. Your girl is urine compared to my myrrh. No point in arguing. We've put them to sleep together with different drugs, so they'll wake at different times. They'll judge for themselves. You and I will never agree. She is more beautiful than he. Look! You're wrong. He is the most handsome. Love will decide the contest. We will wake them, and the one who falls in love with the other is the less beautiful: For the plain love the beautiful. Very well, let love decide. God wills what will happen, or won't happen. Neither of us has won. They love each other equally. One is the mirror of the other. Two full moons in the same sky. - How did you get in? - What difference does it make? Recognize me, Zumurrud? You dared to say I couldn't get it up. Now I'll punish you. God will punish you! Nuredin! Blood of my blood, Zumurrud! Where are you? What's your name, handsome lad, and why are you crying? What's happening? I've lost my slave. I paid a thousand dinars for her. ? blue-eyed Christian stole her from me. I'll die without her! Don't cry. I'll find your Zumurrud, even if I have to disguise myself and search every house. Thank you. I have good news for you, Nuredin! So, Nuredin: I've found your slave. She was taken to Rashid's house. I spoke to her there. She'll be waiting for you tonight, by the garden wall. She'll whistle, you help her down, and you'll escape. I've helped you, now you have to be nice to me. Show me you're a man. My love... You'll make him rise! You bet I will! My love... Nuredin, grab the rope! Help me, my love! My love! Hold this bag, it's full of gold. Who are you? Where are you taking me? I'm me, and I'll take you where I like. Who are you? Nuredin's hair is silky... you feel like a pig! Let me go, you ugly beast. Hold your tongue, or I'll murder you. Walk! We killed that soldier. We'll do the same to you if you don't shut up. I am Giwan the Cruel. We're forty thieves, and tonight well all have you. I've brought you something precious, father, guard it well. I'll be back with the others soon. I bet your head is full of lice. Shall I pick them out for you? Sleep, baby, sleep. Go to bye-byes... Rider from the desert, you will be crowned King of this city. - What? - What is your name? Warden. I am a soldier. When our King dies leaving no heirs, we wait for the first man to arrive from the desert, and make him King. Blessed be the Lord for sending us a slim and handsome man! Drink, and let us enter the city. Before being crowned you must have a wife. You will marry my daughter. Who said I wanted to marry? If you refuse, you'll be thrown from a tower. Then God's will be done. Do you have nothing to do tonight but pray? Don't you like your bride? You are beautiful, Hayat, but I am unhappy. Do you love another woman? If you don't consummate our marriage, you'll be thrown from a tower. - Can I ask you something? If I tell you a secret, will you keep it? I promise. Then look. Now you know my secret. If I'm betrayed, I'll be thrown from a tower! - I won't betray you, Warden! - My name is Zumurrud. I was the beautiful Nuredin's slave, but I don't know where he is. I'll help you. I've had bad luck, but I'll keep your secret. I might find him if we can get many people to come here. Pretend to be my wife and keep our secret. I promise. We'll get many people to come here. Stranger, eat from your own plate! The King said to eat our fill. But not from other people's plates! I'll eat what I like. Eat what you like, then, and may it choke you! I told him not to eat from other people's plates. If the King has him whipped, he deserves it. What is your name and why have you come here? I am Ali. I'm a weaver, come to trade. Look me straight in the eyes! You'd lie to a king, you dog? You're Barsum, who kidnapped a slave girl, aren't you? Yes, King, I am Barsum. Take this blue-eyed man out of the city and put him to death. Excuse me, do you know where I might find my slave, Zumurrud? Children, have you seen Zumurrud pass this way? Who is this Zumurrud? Come with us! Don't be afraid. We'll just give you a nice massage! Lie down here. - Stop, you're making him rise! - Of course, handsome! You're trying to take all his goodness! Part of it is mine, isn't it? No, I made it stand, and as my mother used to say: "Whoever brings barren earth to life, owns it and enjoys it." Perhaps, but my mother used to say: "The game belongs to whoever takes it." You found it, but I'm taking it! Since you two can't come to an agreement, I'll enjoy all of it! Don't eat that! - I'll eat what I like. - Beware, it's cursed. You'll be crucified if you eat it. It happened to someone else. I don't care, you bastards, I'll eat what I like. He'll even eat the plate! Let him be. He's got the face of a dead man already. Anyway, what can you do against God's Will? Beggar, are you strong enough to be my porter? You will be well paid. Give me apples from Syria, peaches from Amman, jasmine from Aleppo, lemons from Egypt, sultanas, myrtle, camomile, pomegranates, white roses, little pastries, nutmeg ring cakes, sweets, short pastry, puff pastry, sugar and incense, amber, musk and candle wax. Nabur! Budur! Come down sisters, I've got everything! "Tagi Almolup, son of King Suleiman, "grew into such a handsome young man "that everyone who saw him was enchanted. "He inspired poems, "even the purest became shameless for his love, "AS the poet said: "I embraced him and became drunk with his perfume. "Like a windswept branch, I became drunk without drinking, "intoxicated by the liquor of his saliva." "Getting off his horse, "Tagi saw a handsome young man dressed in black. "But he seemed depressed, "as a person who is separated from his loved ones." - What is that scroll? - Nothing you might need. Show me. Glory to God, who teaches us what we did not know. Why did you begin to cry when you saw this? My story is long. The facts that link me to this scroll and its owner are very strange. Tell me your story, and about the scroll's author. My name is Aziz, and I was engaged to my cousin Aziza. On the day of the wedding, when all was ready, I went to bathe. Best wishes for you and Aziza! You smell like a flower, Aziz! Aziza, my bride. I just remembered... I forgot to invite my best friend, A'li. I'll fetch him! What are you doing, Aziz? Aziza is waiting! With your handkerchief under your arse, you can't wipe off your sweat! "The sun and moon are astonished when he appears, "and rosebuds are put to shame by his curls." At last! Everyone was here. They ate, drank and waited for you, but you didn't come, and they left. Your father has postponed the wedding for a year. What happened to you? I've fallen in love with a girl who dropped her kerchief for me and disappeared. Didn't she speak? No. She just did this. What does it mean? The finger in the mouth means she's chosen you to be her body's soul. Two fingers between her breasts means: Return in two days to ease her heart. Two days? Aziz! My God, how awful you look. You haven't eaten, drunk or slept. Now get dressed and be happy, Aziz. The two days have passed. Come, get dressed. Hurry. Go to her, and God help your love. Well, Aziz? Why haven't you spent the night in the arms of your beloved? I wasn't making fun of you. Tell me what happened. No, she didn't appear! Aziz, don't be sad. You'll get what you want. She was testing the sincerity of your love. Tomorrow night, sit beneath her window. Your troubles are over. Now you must eat, or you might die. Love drives you wild! You can't eat or sleep! I know. These are the signs of love. - What happened this time? - She did this. What does it mean? "Wait until the sun has set. "When darkness falls, come. "Go to the garden at the far end of the city. "Walk till you find a lamp. "Wait for me. My love is almost killing me." It is not night yet, rest a little! You've not eaten for eight days. How was it? I did everything as you said, only I dozed off. When I awoke, I found these on my belly. The coin is her right eye, the eye one swears by. The dagger means she has sworn to kill you if you disappoint her again tonight. What must I do? Return to her garden tonight. But so you don't doze off again, you must rest now, and eat as well. Lie down and sleep. I will die. Wake up Aziz, and eat. I'm not hungry. Eat, don't act like a child. This time, be sure to neither eat nor sleep in the garden. She will come at dawn. I'll give you some advice. When you leave her, after... having done what you want... recite these lines... In the Name of God, what to do when love becomes my master? I mustn't touch anything! Aziz, my love, you waited for me. So, did you recite the lines? I forgot, I was looking at this scroll she gave to me. Isn't it beautiful? May I have it? Yes, if you like it! Tomorrow, before leaving her, promise to recite those lines. I promise. But now let me sleep. - Farewell! - Listen! In the Name of God, what to do when love becomes my master? He who loves must hide his secret and be resigned to it. - Where is Aziza? - On the terrace, alone and crying. Why? How have you the heart to leave her, without a thought of her suffering? Did you recite it? Yes. She answered with these lines: "He who loves must hide his secret and be resigned to it." He has tried to resign himself, but his heart was broken by an impossible passion. Tomorrow, as you leave, recite those lines to her. He has tried to resign himself, but his heart was broken by an impossible passion. My love. If he cannot resign himself, he might as well be dead. Here. Did you say my lines to her? Yes. She said: "If he cannot resign himself, he might as well be dead." We have heard and obeyed. So we die. Say good-bye to she who has prevented my love. Listen: We have heard and obeyed. So we die. Say good-bye to she who has prevented my love. The girl who recited those lines is dead. If I had known about her, I would not have let you near me. She's my cousin! - Did she know we made love? - Yes. May God make you weep over your youth as you made her weep over hers. Go and see her. How long will the ceremony go on? We shall pray until late tonight. You too, with her death on your conscience What did you do to break her heart? She told me nothing. Tell me. I didn't do anything. Before dying she said you should tell the other girl: "Fidelity is good, but so is infidelity." I'll tell her. She left something to give you, but only when you truly suffer for her death. Show me. I don't see you crying sincerely over her death. Well, I must go now, I can't wait. My love! You were right, she's dead. We buried her today. You are to blame. Beware you don't have to pay for it. She left some words for you: "Fidelity is good, but so is infidelity." She has saved you with these words: I had decided to harm you. Harm me? How? Tonight, before making love to me, go and seek charity for her soul. Have a marble tombstone carved, fit for a saint. I'll do as you ask. Go. Aziz, some more perfume! Have some more of this chilled wine! To your health! Hey you! Read me this letter from my son. He works far away. "Dear father, I am well, "but I can't earn money here. "God's Will be done. I send my love. Your son, Ali." Come into my house for some wine! - It's right here. - Oh, wonderful! Would you prefer to die or to live? - To live! - Then marry me. Me marry you? Then you'll be safe from mad Budur. Who is mad Budur? You've been living with her for a year! How many men she killed before you! You've been safe thanks to Aziza, but where will you find another like her? You know nothing of the perversity of women, do you? No. I want to save you, but not without a reward, like your cousin. I'm rich, nothing's lacking in my house. I've bread on my plate and water in my glass. All I ask of you is to be my cockerel. Cockerel? How? Come close! You can't get away. Do what you like to me, I am your slave. Give it all to me, my life is yours. It's been a year and weve kept our promises. You can go to your mother, but swear to return tonight. I swear it! Budur! You're waiting for me? How did you know I'd return today? I've waited a year, without moving day and night. I'm married and have a son. I can only stay with you for one night. Thank you very much, Aziz. But if you're married, what should I do with you? I don't want you, but I won't let her have you either. Come, women! Help! "Fidelity is good, but so is infidelity!" Once again, Aziza's words save you. Your life is saved, but I'll punish you. Get powders for the wound. What are you doing? Budur, please! Pull! Aziz, my son! Where have you been? What have you been doing all this time? Aziza, how good you were to me! How you loved me! Aziza left this for you. Now I can give it to you. "This is not Budur's, but the Princess Dunya's." "You must believe that I do not blame you for anything." "Rather, I thank God for letting me die before you die. Your Aziza." I searched for Princess Dunya. I entered her garden, I saw her and fell in love with her. What could I do now? I have become like a girl. What's the matter, sir? Let's go to Dunya's city. I love her, even without seeing her. Help me find her. I'll pay you. When my father sees my bloodstained clothes, he'll think I'm dead. That is Dunya's father. Perhaps he seeks a son-in-law. Come on, Tagi! Is the Sheikh of the market here? Yes, but be careful. He prefers bananas to figs! That's him smoking over there. Good morning, Sheikh. What handsome lads! It's a shame you're so dirty from your journey. Before anything else, you must bathe. As the poet said: "May the bath-keeper enjoy a long and happy life. "His hand gently caresses a naked body born of water and light." You'd like to enjoy their beauty in the bath, eh? Of course! I'm not like Dunya, our Princess who hates men, and can't abide any talk of marriage. What did you say? Are you the gardener here? - Yes. Why? - May we see the garden? Alright, I'll open the gate for you. - Whose garden is this? - Dunya's, the king's daughter. - She hates men and won't marry? - Yes, sir. But why? She dreamt a pigeon was caught in a net and saved by its companion. But when the dove was caught the pigeon fled, and the dove died. She thinks all men are like that pigeon. How much does this Dunya pay you? Only one dinar. Listen, I want to do good in this garden. What, sir? - Take these three hundred dinars. - Do as you wish in this garden, sir. - Let's go. - What will you do? You're looking for work? I need two labourers. At your service. I'll pay three dinars a day. - No good. - Four dinars. Six! Nine! We'll only work for you if you pay us one dinar a day each. Are you brothers? Brothers in God, not blood brothers. Why have you made yourselves saints and beggars? To serve God. Tell me what happened to you. It will entertain me, and perhaps teach me something. If it enhances the Glory of God, I will tell you my story. Thank you for helping me, I'm dying of hunger and thirst. But I will reward you: I am a king's son. Bandits attacked us as we took gifts to the King of India Don't tell anyone. I'll shelter you, but our cities are enemies. I'll be no trouble. Let me go to work and then I can pay for what I need. I have studied. I can write, do sums. I know science and literature. That's not worth anything here. Money is all people understand. You can chop wood if you like. Are you man or demon? I'm a man. - How did you find this place? - I suppose it was fate. Perhaps it is to end my pain and sorrow. Who are you, child? A king's daughter. A demon took me and locked me in this tomb. Every ten days he comes here and makes love to me. If I need him, I have only to touch the words on that tablet. And he comes. I want to free you from that demon! You must be mine alone. I'll take you away from here. If the demon comes, I'll deal with him! Run! The demon will kill you! Do you know who these belong to? We've never seen them before. I'm looking for the owner of these shoes. None of us has lost them. Tailor, do you know the man who owns these shoes? Shahzmah, someone's found your shoes! Here's your lover. Kill him and spare yourself. Kill her and I'll let you go unscathed. I can't kill a woman I've never seen before, who's never hurt me! There's love between you two. You've made love with your eyes. I'm not sure you have betrayed me. I won't kill you, but you won't go unpunished. I beg you to be merciful. - Let me go. - Don't hope for that. Come, come! Hold fast, you damned monkey! In the Name of God and by His power, become that which your nature most craves to be. A monkey! Come here! Captain! Before we reach port you must write the story of our voyage. You forgot, Captain. Where are you going, my pretty? "Let destiny take its course "Accept willingly what is given. Be not happy or sad about anything. "But if you open the inkwell of power and grace, "ensure your ink flows with liberality and generosity." This writing is truly beautiful. None of my advisors can form such exquisite characters. Dress the author in the attire of honour and bring him here. Ibriza, look. Father, why do you let a stranger see me? Is my daughter right? You are a man and not a monkey? Father, he is a man, not a monkey. Free him from his present condition, then, and I shall appoint him Vizier. I shall obey your command. Though it may cost me my life, you are welcome. Poor monkey. Your soul is stronger than your nature. Thank you for giving me back my soul. She sacrificed her life for me. Such was my grief, it could have shattered mountains. I felt I had offended God. You are determined to relinquish everything for wisdom. Why? Because of destiny, which governs all human life. - God be with you. - And also with you, stranger. I wish to entrust you with a mission. Very well, I accept. God has revealed to me that tomorrow at noon, you will come to me on that island, and find me dead near a well. Wash me and wrap me in the shroud you will find beside me. Take my turban and tunic, and when someone asks for them, give them to him. - I will. Yunan, my son. Keep your eyes closed and listen to me? The sea, Yunan, the sea. Ask your father if you can go on a voyage. Father. Haven't we islands far away? Yes. Why? I want to arm a ship and visit them. You, set off to sea? Are you sure, my son? You're even afraid of bathing! You still play with children, and you sleep all the time! Father, I want to see the world. Climb the mast and tell us what you see! To starboard, the sea teems with fish! Over there is a shadow, sometimes black, sometimes white! We're lost. We'll all perish. Why say that? We are near Black Stone Mountain. Beneath a copper dome stands a copper knight. As long as he is there boats will be smashed against the rocks below. Dig beneath your feet: You will find a copper bow and a lead arrow. Aim at the knight beneath the dome. Topple him into the sea and free the world of this misfortune. Stay inside here. - Don't come out for any reason. - Very well. - When I return I will open the door. - Farewell, father. Farewell, my son. Who are you? Go away! Don't kill me! Don't you want to kill me? You won't kill me, will you? I'm glad you've calmed down. I am a king, a king's son and your friend. I don't want to kill you, why would I? I am fifteen today, and it is predicted that on this day I will be killed by a man with no eyes who will come from the sea and free the world by toppling a copper knight. To pay for this, an innocent victim must die. Me. Then trust in the goodness of God and be happy. I'm glad I was shipwrecked and am here to defend you. Anyone who seeks to harm you will answer to me. I'm glad you are my guest here, even though it is underground. There's a beautiful bath here, go in. As the poet says: "Happy is the bath boy, touching the breast of Ali and the back of Malik. "The bath may seem an inferno, but it is paradise. "You'll find bodies as beautiful as suns and moons there." Come. I know a poem about the bath, too. "A life of joy "for those who bathe: "Upon them ardent tears are poured." Look there! That boy on the beach, there. He could be Yunan, my son. Yes, it is him, I recognise him! Son, it is I, your father! God be with you, sir. Are you to give me a tunic? Yes, sir. Give it to me. - What is happening? - Farewell, father. My son, where are you going? Dunya, look in that house! How beautiful it is! Who can have painted the ceiling? It's beautiful, Dunya! This is the story from my dream. Yes, the dove caught in the net. But here is more: The pigeon who you thought was a coward was caught and killed by a bird of prey! Sometimes dreams are bad teachers, because one dream does not ever tell the whole truth. The truth lies in many dreams. Come here, slave! Look carefully, don't make a mistake! What is this called? Tell me! - Then it's called pigeon. - Wrong! Tell me, then! It's called perfumed meadow grass. Thank God for perfumed meadow grass! Now it's my turn. Come here. What is this called? Look carefully! Perfumed meadow grass! - Wrong, stupid! - Tell me, then! Peeled sweet pomegranate. - It's not over yet! Tell me. What is this called? Look well, don't make another mistake! - Peeled sweet pomegranate. - Idiot! That's not it. - Tell me, then! - The Inn of Good Food. And what is this called? Look carefully! No mistakes! - Who knows? - I do! Tell us, then! This is the donkey, which grazes perfumed meadow grass, eats peeled sweet pomegranates, and spends the night in the Inn of Good Food! Zumurrud! Tear me to pieces. Go on! I'm tired of looking for her. I had the most beautiful slave in the world and I lost her. Come, lion. Kill me, eat me, then my suffering will be over. What now? What do you want? I don't understand. Am I to follow you? Alright. I'll come. Don't! It's dangerous to eat from that dish. All who ate that were killed. Let him eat. See what happens. Let me eat. If I'm killed, it will end my suffering. - What is your name? - Nuredin. Dress him, perfume him and bring him to my chambers. The King is treating him courteously, not killing him. The King has noticed his lovely eyes. Perhaps our King prefers the melon to the plum. I'd have him too, my friends! Come here and massage my legs. Come on! Higher! I'll massage your calves, no more. You refuse my orders? Beware! You must do as I say, boy. I want you as my lover. To reward you, I may make you an Emir. - What must I do? - Lie on the bed. I've never done it before. Take back your presents, let me leave. Obey me. Lie on the bed, or I'll have you beheaded. Turn over. Pull your trousers down. Come, quick! Don't hurt me too much. Do you like love poems? Don't look at me. Listen. The down of a first beard as the poet writes it. Two twigs of myrtle on a young man's cheeks. The sun and moon are astonished when he appears. What shame for the myrtle when the youth unbends. Alright. Another poem. Don't look at me! I told a young man of my desires. "Stop offending me!" he said. But when I showed him a dinar, the handsome young man said: "If my destiny is to be mounted by you, I can't escape it." And do you know this other one? Don't look at me! My love is great, and the young man said to me: "Take with strength everything that you desire!" Won't it stand? Not unless you touch it. Go on, touch it! You have to obey me. Go on! You're made like a woman. Now mine is standing! My love, don't you recognise your slave? Zumurrud, my love! I know a poem, too. What a night! God has made no other like this. Its beginning was bitter, but how sweet is its end.
