You fucking deserve it, you assholes! Oh, are you okay, baby? No. Get the fuck out of here! What the hell are you doing dressed like that? For the Mountain Man Festival, thought we'd dress up. Yeah, where are your costumes? What? We don't have any. You can't go without a costume. It shows lack of commitment. Can we have this conversation after I can get dressed? Okay. Okay. Nice, Billy. Ha-ha-ha. Grrr... Nice. Assholes. KALEEN: This is Kaleen Webber, reporting from the small town of Fairlake... ...which, once a year, turns into a big town on Halloween... ...due to the 10th annual Mountain Man Music Festival. People from all over the country descend upon Fairlake... ...for a weekend of music, partying and fun at the fairgrounds just outside town. The festival has grown over the years to where it now rivals... ...Coachella and Lollapalooza. But some say that its free spirit and rowdy crowds reminds them of Burning Man... ...which has local officials concerned on this night. Now back to you at the studio. Great. KALEEN: Here's the deal. I'm going for a run to get my head out of this town crap. I'll meet you here for the live feed at 11. And everything better be ready to go. Go away, kid. Ha-ha-ha. Hurry up. We gotta get on the road. I don't wanna be late. All right, give me a minute to get up first. We heard you're the one-minute man. (WHISTLES) No. I assure you he has no problems in that department. All right. I'm starving. I gotta make breakfast first. Aw, come on, Billy. BILLY: You gotta start your day out right. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER HEADPHONES) Ha, ha. (GASPS) Nice costume, creep. (CACKLING) You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of you kids partying, making a mess and trying to scare people. Well, you know what? You don't scare me. So fuck you. Go home. (SCREAMING) (CACKLES) KALEEN: Help me! Help me, please! Somebody help me! Hey, hey. Over here. Oh, please help. They're chasing me. Follow me. This way. (SOBBING) Down here. (WHIMPERING) Okay. Okay, I think they've gone. Thank you. You saved me from those maniacs. Hey, you're bleeding pretty badly there. Let me fix that for you. Thank God for you. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Thank God for me. Now, you keep pressure on that. Mm-hm. You stay here. Okay. I'm gonna make sure they've gone. Okay, it's all clear. This way. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. But there's, uh... There's just one thing I forgot. What? This. (GRUNTS) (KALEEN SCREAMS THEN GRUNTING) Hey, give me a hand, will you? (GRUNTS) No, you fucking idiot. The body. Jesus fucking Christ. (PLAYING DOWN-TEMPO MUSIO Wake and bake, brother. Thanks. Heh. You're such a slob. Can you try and be a little bit cleaner for me? What? You look like a pig. (SNORTS) All right. Check it out. I got all our party favors arranged by date and time. So this is cutting into my overhead. But in honor of this weekend and Julian's great idea for us to come out here... ...I've made an exception. First up, some chronic, which you're participating in. And then some X for when we go trick or treating... ...and some shrooms for when the bands start playing. Oh. You've been out of school for two semesters. What do your parents think? Oh, no. They don't know shit. And I wanna keep it that way. Ah, besides, you know, I'm a budding entrepreneur. Why did we have to come all the way out here? Because it's Mountain Man, baby. Hey, come on, look, we could have gone to Burning Man. But I'm not gonna drive all the way across country. We got a homegrown version of it here. Yeah. Mountain Man has got a much more interesting story to it, anyway. You know the story, Cruz? I'm not from around here, remember? Okay, well, we're going to a small town called Fairlake. It was founded in 1814 or some shit like that. Well, apparently, the local miners didn't get along too well with the hill people. I guess it was a territory dispute. There was conflicts over the next couple of years. Now, Halloween night, 1817... ...the entire town was ravaged by hillbillies... ...in the largest massacre in the state's history. The only problem was no bodies were found. It was just... Just blood. Lots of it. It was... You know, it... The entire town, every inhabitant disappeared. Was never seen again. CRUZ: That's awful. Well... Legend has it, the hillbillies hauled all the bodies up to the woods... ...created a huge bonfire and then they cooked the fair residents of Fairlake. Well... And then they ate them. Bah! (ALL LAUGH) Okay, you know what? I don't wanna go. Oh, come on, baby, we're almost there. No. I don't wanna celebrate a massacre. It's innocent fun. It's wrong. We'll just go tonight, we'll leave tomorrow, okay? Come on, Cruz. Just one night, huh? Please? (PLAYING DOWN-TEMPO MUSIO Okay, fine. It is fine. (CHUCKLES) (CLANKING) (GRUNTING) What the fuck is all this shit? What have I told you about this? I told you a thousand fucking times... ...you never leave anything behind. You never ever leave anything behind! What if somebody found this, huh? Then you got oops investigating, snooping around. You don't live in some goddamn hospital in the middle of nowhere any more. You live closer to civilization, a lot fucking closer! I have been doing this for 30 years... ...and I have never had to move. Do you know why? Because I never leave shit behind! I swear to fucking God, you three pinheads... ...you'd all be under lock and key by now if I hadn't have happened across you. (GROWLS THEN GRUNTING) You live in my fucking house now and you play by my fucking rules. You do as I say... ...or I swear to God, I will take you all down, kin or no kin. Get her processed. Looking forward to the trip? Yeah. Thinking about getting me a new .30-60 for the occasion. It was lucky of Jason to win the bear license lottery. I know. He's very excited. Well, he's a good guy to invite me along. I know. That's why I married him. You sure you don't wanna come? I've got a job to do. You need to learn to relax a bit. You're always so by-the-book. You ride us like we're in the military. Discipline, Junior, it's a good tool to use in life. BIGGS: Ready for tonight? Mob of kids, such a pain in the keester. It should be a big night for drunk and disorderly. (PHONE RINGS) Sheriff Carter. MAN: Who is the sexiest sheriff in all of Greenbrier County? I'm the only sheriff in Greenbrier County. Still doesn't mean you're not sexy. Hey, I just blew off the second shift. I'm headed home. That's good. Junior's buying a new rifle for your hunt this weekend. (LAUGHS) Tell him it won't make him a better shot. Yeah, I already did. I'm gonna fix some lasagna tonight for dinner. I'll stop by and bring you some? That would be great. But call first. It's gonna be a busy night. I may head down to the fairgrounds. Then I'll bring it to you there. I'll call you later. Bye, honey. Okay, bye, honey. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (ALL LAUGHING) GUS: Gotta turn this up. There's supposed to be about 20 bands there. Oh, who's playing? The Cheetah Whores. Oh, who are they? An all-girl band. Freaking awesome. Yeah. Gus' favorite band. CRUZ: Oh. If they're so awesome, why haven't I heard of them? You're from the West Coast. They don't play there. When are you gonna go back, by the way? Mm, June. But just for a month to see my parents. Billy is coming with me. Yeah. LITA: Nice. We are gonna have an epic time. Meeting the folks? That's getting pretty serious. Who? Me? Serious? Never. Look out! (ALL SCREAMING) Is everyone okay? Is anybody hurt? I'm all right. CRUZ: No, we're okay. Oh, shit. (SIGHING) Where did he come from? Did We hit him? BILLY: I'm not sure. Well, we should see if he's dead. You guys, stay here. Goddamn it. I didn't see him in the rain. Yeah, I think he's dead. But I didn't hit him. You must have. BILLY: Hey. (BILLY GROANS) Fuck you! Unn! GUS: You trying to fuck with us? BILLY: Get up. GUS: You piece of shit. (MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (SIREN WAILING) Freeze. Put your hands on your head. BILLY: He stabbed me. Put your hands on your head now! Don't you move. Turn around and walk towards me. Shit. ANGELA: Slowly. Go! I want everyone to wait together by your vehicle. Biggs? BIGGS: I've got them, sheriff. Don't you move. Face down on the ground. Right hand behind your back. Left hand. (HANDCUFFS CLICKING) Turn around. I need a wagon. Route 96, mile marker 30. MAN: Copy that. On its way. Great, thanks. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) BIGGS: Hey, sheriff. It looks like we've got an entire pharmacy here. And the festival hasn't even started yet. It's gonna be a long night. Junior, can you stay with the car until the tow truck arrives? Until we get a search? I don't wanna mess up evidence. Sure thing, boss. (ENGINE STARTS) (ENGINE STARTS) (CACKLING) (CACKLING CONTINUES) What the fuck? Hey. Hold it right there. Shit! (GROANING) (GROWLING) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING AND GROANING) (CACKLING) (GRUNTING) (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) (PERSON BLOWING WHISTLE) WOMAN: Hey. (PERSON WHISTLING) MAN: That should do it. You need to have those stitches removed in about three weeks. Thank you. All done here, sheriff. Thanks for coming, Rick. That's all right. I know how busy it's gonna get for you tonight. Goodbye. Good night. You know, I just don't know what I'm gonna do. If I get charged, they're gonna take my scholarship away from me. We can get kicked out of school. LITA: Billy, you gotta tell her. It was your drugs, not ours. No, no. If he claims it's all his... ...they could throw the book at him. I don't care. I'm sitting in jail because of him. I just don't know what I'm gonna do. All right, hey, don't worry, all right? I got this. Sheriff, can I speak with you a moment? What is it? The drugs are mine. My friends had nothing to do with it. That's to be determined. BILLY: Honestly, they're mine. They'll tell you. He's right. Please let them go. I'll take responsibility. All right. I'm gonna need space tonight, anyway. Don't leave town. We won't go anywhere. ANGELA: There's a motel at the end of the street. Thanks. Come get your things. We'll bring you back some dinner, Billy. Thanks. Hey, what about me? You saw how they attacked me. Why am I being held? Assault with a deadly weapon. (CHUCKLES) That's bullshit. The out on the boy's arm says otherwise. Well, would you at least move me to another cell? This drunk stinks. You'll survive. (CHATTERING) CAMERAMAN: Where is she? I've been calling her cell for the last hour. She's not picking up. Freaking diva. I hate talent. You're gonna have to fill in. What? No, I can't. You can and you will. No one goes to dead air on my watch. Okay. Here we are on Main Street in the town of Fairlake, West Virginia. The kids are out for Halloween in full force... ...but they're joined by a bunch of hillbillies... ...for the 10th annual Mountain Man Music Festival. So whether you're dressed as a ghost or a witch or a hillbilly... ...everyone is sure to have a happy Halloween... ...with some great music to top it all off. That's all for now. I'm Virginia Kelly from Live Action News. Good job. Is this it? JULIAN: Oh, 3, this is it. It looks all right. JULIAN: Nice. LITA: This is our bed, Gus. ANGELA: Seems like you've been running for quite some time. Well, your running just ended. There is no statute of limitations for murder. You have no idea what you've gotten yourself into, do you? A lot of paperwork, I suspect. (DIALING) (LINE RINGING) MAN: U. S. Marshal's office. Yeah, this is Sheriff Carter in Fairlake. I have a fugitive for you. He's been on the run for 30 years. What's his name? Maynard Odets. Case number 316165. We can have transport there by 10 a.m. Yeah, that'll be fine. The marshals will be here to pick you up in the morning. You won't live that long. (CHUCKLES) I highly doubt that. (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) No, I... No, I know. I know. No, it's... Yeah, but it was a complete accident. It was an a... Yeah. Tomorrow. The car is totaled. (METAL RATTLING) (ENGINE REVVING) (METAL SQUEAKING) No, I sent the other deputies to the fairgrounds to police the festival. All except Junior. Which reminds me, he should be back by now. Jason? Jason? Mr. Brodin? (LAUGHING) Mr. Brodin... Lost the signal. Probably for the best. To say Billy's dad is pissed is the understatement of the year. Is he coming tomorrow? JULIAN: Yeah. How much trouble do you think Billy's in? Oh, God, there's a lot of drugs in that bag. I don't think he's gonna get off with a misdemeanor. Do you think Billy's gonna go to jail? Billy's dad will throw the best lawyers because Billy's dad is loaded. He might not have to. He might get lucky. Yeah. I wouldn't worry about it. Billy's dad's connected up to the Wazoo. Okay, so let's go to the festival. What the hell, Julian? We can't go now. Well, we can't help Billy sitting in a hotel room. Why not? We... Come on, we came all this way. And how do you propose we get there? Uh, walk. Well, I'm not going anywhere, guys. Here, babe. (IMITATES GUN COCKING) (IMITATES GUNSHOT) Damn drunk kids. (ALARM WAILING) (THREE FINGER CACKLING) Hey! What the hell's going on here? (GUARD GRUNTS) (SCREAMING) (ALL LAUGHING) (MAYNARD LAUGHING) Will you shut up? It's started. They're coming for me and you're dead. But you don't know it yet. Who's coming for you? MY boys. They're gonna cut your liver out and eat it in front of you. I don't wanna be in here with this guy. Can you please put me in the other cell? You're all dead. You hear me, kid? Fuck you, old man. You can go home, Mose. MOSE: Where are your deputies? Covering the festival. Maybe I should stick around? What for? You got nobody with you, just in case. It's fine, Mose. He's just a crazy old man. Just in case. If you don't mind, that is. Okay, but make yourself useful. Go through the drawers for the flashlights. Light ain't gonna save you. If you don't shut up, I'm gonna charge you with threatening an officer. Hey, charge away, officer. Shit. (CHUCKLING) (GIRLS LAUGHING) GIRL 1: Oh, my God. (GIRLS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) GIRL 2: Here. GIRL 1: Oh, my God. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) Hi, officer. I think I took a wrong turn. Can you tell me how to get backstage? Another wrong turn, huh? I can show you, but you need a pass to get in. I will do anything to get a pass. Oh, there's no use talking to you Dead end, true This is what I'm thinking Oh, she'll remind you Only take a second Till you see I'm just a fake I'm just a... ANGELA: Shit. Deputy Biggs, come in. (OVER RADIO) Junior, it's Angela, come in. (MOANING) (CHUCKLES) Mike, Kevin, you guys out there? This is what I'm thinking Oh, she'll remind you (PANTING AND MOANING) (LAUGHS) Looks like you're all alone, you dumb bitch. JULIAN: Four tickets at 90 bucks a pop, that's 260 bucks. Mm, great. So we sit around in the dark all night. So much fun. So much fun. It's great. You know what? I'm gonna go and take Billy some food. LITA: You think all the power's out in the jail as well? Oh, looks like the whole town's out. JULIAN: Yeah. No, of course not. The whole town's out. The whole town's out. At the concert, having a good time like we should be. Here, take this with you. Oh, thanks. See you later. LITA: See you, babe. GUS: See you. JULIAN: Bye. (DOGS BARKING) Hello? (CACKLING) (SCREAMING) (PAPER RIPPING) Um, guys? Guys. Yeah? I'm gonna go see Billy. GUS: Cool. I'm giving you guys some privacy. Aah! Unn! (GROANING) (CACKLING) Happy Halloween, asshole. JULIAN: Son of a bitch! (THREE FINGER GRUNTING) (GAGGING) Ahh... MOSE: There you go. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) What are you doing here? I thought I'd hang out with Billy and Cruz. Cruz isn't here. What? That's weird. She left with food about 20 minutes ago. Well, where is she? I thought she came here. Maybe she changed her mind. Visiting hours are over. Come in the morning. Oh, come on. Can't I just hang out here for a little while? (LAUGHING) Yeah, why don't you let him stay? One more dead body to add to the pile. What the fuck? This old bastard has been promising to kill everybody. He says his boys are coming to break him out. BILLY: And it's just you and the drunk. Watch your mouth, kid. I'm sober now. It's probably best if you go. Wouldn't you want another hand in case this guy's telling the truth? You can stay until your friend gets here. Then you can walk back to the hotel. What happened to you? Fucking kids hit me with a paint balloon. That's why you should walk back with the girl. All right. Hey, man. So you talked to my dad? Yeah, I know, he's really, really, really extremely, monumentally pissed. Well, I guess I expected that. Yeah, he'll be here in the morning to post bail. Did she say what she's charging you with? She didn't say, but there was enough stuff for a felony. Man, I'm fucked, aren't I? (LAUGHING) (BILLY SIGHS) Yeah, he's creepy as fuck. (LITA MOANING) Where are you going? Lita... What? I've been thinking. Okay. We both graduate in May. And I was thinking we could move in together. Gus, come on, you know I'm moving to New York. I've got my job lined up. But accounting is so boring. (CHUCKLES) Don't go. Babe, we've talked about this a thousand times. I'm going. Then I'll go with you. (SIGHS) Look... ...Gus, I like you. I might even love you. But... I don't know, I just... I need to spend some time on my own. You understand that? Lita, I love you. And I don't wanna lose you. Marry me. What? Oh, my God. You're proposing to me in some flea bag motel... ...in the middle of West Virginia? Gus, come on. It's the thought that counts. Yeah. Babe... ...come on. (SIGHS) Get dressed before Julian comes back. I'm gonna take a shower. I'm sorry. (SIGHS) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (BANGING ON DOOR) All right. I heard you. Keep your shirt on. Who the fuck are you? You got the wrong hotel room, pal. Move along. (GRUNTS) Are you so fucking drunk you don't speak English? I said, move along, you dumb shit. Gus, who was that? Some drunk guy from the festival. Couldn't find his room. Oh. Cool costume though. Ow. Fuck. Stupid thing. Stupid shower doesn't work. It's freezing. (BANGING ON DOOR) Goddamn, you son of a bitch. Look, I already told your drunk little buddy you got the wrong room. What is it with you people? What, are you fucking retarded? (ALL GRUNTING) (GUS GROANS) Gus? Gus, what was that? So where the hell is Cruz? It can't have taken her this long to get here. I don't know. You want me to look for her? MAYNARD: She's probably dead. My boys already got to her on the street. Shut the fuck up, old man. You can say what you like, college boy... ...but your reckoning is on its way. Hey, can you just shut this old bastard up? I can't stand listening to him any more. Well, I can't gag him if that's what you're saying. Give me five minutes with him and he'll be quiet for the night. You've got yourself in enough trouble, young man. Just ignore him. (CLATTERING) LITA: Gus? Gus? (GLASS SHATTERS) (GRUNTING) (SNIFFS) (GROANS) (SCREAMS THEN SOBBING) LITA: No. Please. No. (GROANING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) That's probably her now. Hey, sweetheart. How's it going? ANGELA: It's been an interesting night. JASON: Yeah. I saw the power outage and I thought I'd bring you some candles. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks, honey. Mose, can you light some of these for me? MOSE: Sure. JASON: So, what's going on? I've got a fugitive who's being picked up by the marshals... ...and a kid on drug charges. And I bet your night is just starting. Heh. Yeah, probably is. JASON: You hungry? ANGELA: Starving. JASON: Why don't call your deputies and come home for a sandwich? I can't reach them and besides, I should really stay here. Those guys aren't going anywhere. Take some time for yourself, you know? Even the sheriff is entitled to a lunch break. ANGELA: Jason. JASON: All right. I'll go fix some sandwiches and I'll be back in a bit. Last supper. What's his problem? Who is that guy? Don't ask. Okay. See you soon. ANGELA: See you later. (DOOR CLOSES) GUS: Help! Somebody help! Please! Help! Help me! (ENGINE REVVING) Stop! Please stop! (SCREAMING) Somebody help! Somebody! Help! Help me! Let me go, you crazy fuck. (ONE EYE, SAW TOOTH & THREE FINGER LAUGHING) What are you doing? No. No. No. Please, no, no. (SCREAMING) Fifty cents. Buck. Uh... Call. (HORN HONKING) MOSE: Who are they? I don't know. I never seen the truck before. MAYNARD: I told you. It's my boys. They're here to get me. (GRUNTING) Shit. Help! That's Gus. (GUS SCREAMING) Somebody, please! Help! (SCREAMING) (THREE FINGER CACKLING) Oh, God. We gotta get him out of the middle of the road. (RETCHES AND COUGHS) Oh, I can't. I can't. Give me a hand. (JULIAN VOMITING) (CHUCKLES) One down, huh, sheriff? You're not going anywhere and you're gonna pay for this. You hear me, you bastard? MOSE: What are we gonna do? (MAYNARD WHISTLING) ANGELA: Get out. I need to find Cruz. JULIAN: And Lita. ANGELA: Listen to me. You're all deputized. If you help me, it will go a long way in my report to the court. But I wanna go after my girlfriend. No, we all stay here. We hold out until help arrives. Mose, you watch the front door. You two, cover the windows. (SHOTGUN COCKING) They want us to split up. It makes it easier for them to kill us that way. So we should stick together, here until dawn. Now, get to your stations. We need to call for help. Lines are dead. Cell too. Uh, sheriff, uh, Lee has a short-wave radio in the back of his thrift store. I've seen it. We need power to operate it. Lee has a generator. Good thinking. Listen, I'm gonna go across the street to the store. I'm gonna fire up the shortwave and call for help. I'll go with you. No, no, no. You stay and make sure they don't get in. Not a bright idea there, sheriff. Split up and die, remember? He's right. ANGELA: I will not risk your lives. This is my job. Now, cover me when I'm on the street. Okay. Okay, where are you? Okay, come on. Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Yes. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Okay. Okay. Okay. Gas. Yeah. Okay. (THREE FINGER CACKLING) We should go help her. Nope. I gave my word I'd stay here. I'll go. Give it a minute. Just... If we hear another shot, we'll go. But we don't... We don't know this woman. She's not Cruz or Lita. We should be going after them. Just wait. Let's go find the girls. If you leave, they'll throw the book at you. Wait a few minutes, see if she comes. If she does, we'll tell her we're both going. All right. Ten minutes. (SIGHS) (GENERATOR SPUTTERS) (GENERATOR STARTS) (STATIC CRACKLING) This is Sheriff Carter of Fairlake declaring emergency. (OVER RADIO) Is anyone out there? Over. (REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) Sheriff Carter of Fair/ake, West Virginia declaring an emergency. Can anyone hear me? Over. Yup, I hear you, sheriff. What's your name and where are you? Uh, Teddy Tabet. I'm in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire. Okay, listen to me carefully, Teddy. I need you to call the Virginia State Police in Moundsville. Have them send every available officer to Fairlake right away. It's an emergency. What's going on down there? The town is under siege by three hillbillies. They're trying to break... ...one of their relatives out of jail. They've already killed one person already. Did you say Fairlake, West Virginia? Yes, that's right. And we have no phone service. So I need you to call the state police right away. Can you do that? Okay, okay. One minute. (TYPING ON KEYBOARD) (LAUGHING) Are you stoned? What? Are you stoned or do you just think I'm stupid? What are you talking about, Teddy? I need your help. Tonight's the Mountain Man Festival, right? You think it would be funny to scramble the entire state police... ...because you convinced some dork to call? This is real. I am the sheriff and I need your help. This is serious, Teddy. Hey, listen, it's a felony to file a fake police report, okay? I'm not stupid. We here in Dixville Notch are a pretty savvy bunch. You can't pull the wool over my eyes. So, uh, yeah, heh, have a good night, officer. Wait, wait, wait. Please, listen, Teddy, you gotta believe me. This is a matter of life and death. (SCREAMS) Shit. What was that? Somebody dying. You believe me now, asshole? Just call the police. (GENERATOR POWERS DOWN) MOSE: I think I got one of them. BILLY: Shit, shit. You idiot. What if that was the sheriff? (SCREAMING) Are you hurt? Oh, my God. Is that Gus? Is that Gus? Come inside. LITA: Oh, my God. BILLY: Shh, Shh, shh. All right, okay. You're all right. You're all right. ANGELA: Julian, let me in. What happened? This drunk nearly killed my friend. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. He has no business carrying a gun. It was an accident! I should beat this shit out of you! Hey, calm down. Calm down. I said, calm down. Were you hit? No. Okay. Have you seen Cruz? Were you with her? She left before Julian. MAYNARD: She's dead, lover boy. Probably being digested right now. My boys have a taste for flesh... ...especially cute little blonds. Will you shut the fuck up? If anything happened to her, I'm gonna fucking kill you. (SHOTGUN COCKS) Let me go... ...and maybe the rest of them will live to see the dawn. You're not getting out of there. There's four of you and one of her. Think how much you wanna live. You're out of your mind if you think any one of us is gonna let you out. Suit yourselves. Did you reach anybody on the short wave? Yes. Great. That means help is coming. I don't know. What do you mean? The dumb shit on the other line, I don't think he believed me. I'm going to look for Cruz. Hey, I told you, no. Well, then you better lock me back up. ANGELA: What? All right, I may be a fuck up. I'm irresponsible, I'm unreliable and I'm definitely juvenile, but I am loyal. I love Cruz. I love her more than anything I've ever loved in my life... ...and I'm not gonna sit in here while she's out there on her own. I couldn't live with myself if I did that. So either lock me up or let me go. Here, you're gonna need this. Thank you. I'm going with you. All right. You gonna be all right? Be careful. We Will. We'll look around here, see if we can find her. All right. Keep your eyes open. Cruz. Cruz, it's Billy. Come out. If Cruz knows what's up, she'll be hiding and won't come out. Yeah. I hope that's the case. Mister? Call me Mose. (SOBBING) Why are they doing this? They wanna break him out, I suppose. But killing innocent people? Why kill Gus? He had nothing to do with keeping that old guy locked up. I get the feeling that killing ain't too much of a stretch for this bunch. What if no help comes? It will. Don't worry. And Billy and Julian? They'll find your friend... ...and then they'll be back. Cruz! Are you out there? Where the hell could she be? I don't know, man. (THREE FINGER CACKLING) Jesus Christ. What the hell was that? Move, Billy. (MEN CACKLING) Shit. Shit. We gotta get out of the street. We're sitting ducks. There. Oh, shit. Cruz. Oh, my God, baby. Oh, my God. Oh, Cruz. What kind of fucking animals are they? JULIAN: There's nothing we can do for her now. I'm taking her back. I'm not gonna leave her here like some piece of trash. Oh, Jesus. (THREE FINGER CACKLING) Son of a bitch. JULIAN: Billy! (JULIAN GRUNTS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (COUGHING) (PANTING) Julian. Wake up! (COUGHS) Fuck. Shit. Oh, God, Bi... Billy, what's going on? I can't move. I can't move. You gotta get out of that chain, man. Chain? Can you get out? JULIAN: Shit. Fuck. No. Just... No. Fuck. No, there's... We gotta call for help. All right? Help! BILLY: Help us, anybody! JULIAN: Help! BILLY: Anybody! Help! Fuck. (THREE FINGER CACKLING) Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? (ENGINE STARTS) Oh, my, God. Oh, my, God. (THREE FINGER CACKLING) Help! Help! JULIAN: Help us! BILLY: Anybody! JULIAN: Help! (SCREAMING) Julian. Julian, save me. Save... Help me, man! What the...? What the fuck? No, don't. No, don't. Fuck. No, don't... Don't leave me. Julian, don't leave me. Don't leave me. No! No! No! No! Julian! Stop it, you motherfucker! (SCREAMING) What...? (BILLY SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMING) (THREE FINGER CACKLES) We can't sit here all night and wait for them to come back. Somebody needs to go for help. Yes, and that has to be you, Mose. Can you do it? (ANGELA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) MAYNARD (WHISPERING): Hey, Lita. Why don't you save yourself? How? Convince her to let me out of here. I can do it, sheriff. Take my truck. Take it to the fairgrounds and find Junior... ...and the other deputies and bring them back here. Do not stop for anyone or anything. MAYNARD: Me and my boys will go... ...disappear into the night. You'll be safe. I don't trust you. Why would I stick around here? Think about it. You're a college kid. Use your head. Save yourself and your friends. ANGELA: Mose... ...you okay? I could do with a drink. I won't. You can count on me, Angela. I know not too many people have counted on me in the past to do anything right... ...but I'm turning over a new leaf, starting tonight. I will be back with help. I promise. Why don't you just give them what they want? Give them the old man. You can track them when you have help. No. I want justice. Justice? What about justice for my boyfriend whose body is lying on your porch? What about justice for Gus, huh? ANGELA: Don't you see? If I let him go, you may never get justice for your boyfriend. Look, I'm sorry about what happened to you, but you're not changing my mind. You ready? Let's do this. There's a radio in my truck. Keep in constant contact and be careful. My truck is at the gas station by the junkyard. I'll cover you. (DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES) ANGELA: Go. Go, go. God, come on, come on, come on. Please, please, please start. (ENGINE SPUTTERS) (ENGINE STARTS) You can do it. Mose, can you hear me? MOSE: I got you, sheriff. I'm on my way like a bat out of hell. I need you there in one piece. Not too fast, okay? Roger that. MOSE: I'm just getting on the highway now, sheriff. No sign of them. Good, keep me posted. I told you, I wouldn't let you... Shit. (TIRES SCREECHING) (HORN HONKING) Mose? Mose? Mose? Come in, Mose. Mose? (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) (PANTING) (MUFFLED SCREAMING) (WHIMPERING) (THREE FINGER CACKLING) Billy and Julian should have been back by now, shouldn't they? I know. They're dead, aren't they? We don't know that. I don't wanna die here. Neither do I. I wanna leave. There's no place to go. There must be a car or a truck or something. Mose took my only truck. Well, then I'll steal a car. Anything. I just need to get the fuck out of here. You know how to hot-wire a car? No. Look, the festival will be over soon. My deputies will be back. We just have to wait a little longer. And what if I can't wait that long? You really don't have a choice. To go out there now by yourself would be suicide. Not if you come with me. I can't leave here. There's two of us left. What can we possibly do if they come for him? Our best. I think you're crazier than he is. (MOSE MUMBLING AND WHIMPERING) Sheriff. Help me, sheriff. Sheriff! (MOSE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Sheriff. Sheriff. Help me. Oh, no. Please. Don't do it. Help me. (MOSE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY AND SOBBING) (DOORKNOB CLICKING) (WHISPERING) You can surprise her. Take her weapon and force her to let me out. (WHISPERING) I can't. She's just a woman. Leave me alone. I wanna see you live. You're smart, Lita. Too smart to die. I said, leave me alone. You're smarter than your friends. Hell, you even got away from my boys once. You deserve to live. I will tell my boys to let you live... ...if you help me. I don't believe you. Well... ...you and that bitch are certainly gonna die if you just stand there and do nothing. That I can guarantee you. MOSE: No. No. No! (MOSE SCREAMING) Do you hear that? What? (GRUNTING AND SCREAMING) It's Mose. Well, where's it coming from? He's in the thrift store. Here, take this. Watch him. If anyone comes in, shoot them. LITA: Wha...? What are you gonna do? What I can. Oh, God. (MOSE SCREAMING) (ANGELA SCREAMS) (GRUNTS AND COUGHS) Now's your chance. No. Oh, don't be stupid. Save yourself. Have some vision. You're smart. And you wanna live, don't you? Yes. Well, then open this cell. I will go away and so will my boys. Think. How can I trust you? Well, you have the gun, don't you? You open this cell... ...and I will walk away. Promise. The keys are in the gun locker to your left. That's it. Good girl. It is as simple as turning a key in a lock. That right there in your hand is the key to your life. If I let you out of here... ...you let me go free, right? You and your men, you don't come after me. That's the deal, right? Done deal. If you try anything... ...I swear to God, I will kill you. All I want is to get out of here. Back up. Go. Okay, get out of here. Slowly. Move. You know, Lita, you did the right thing. Just get out of here. Oh, and, uh... ...you know what I was saying about vision? (LITA SCREAMING) (COUGHING) (PANTING) Somebody help me. Lita? My eyes. God. I warned you, bitch. (GROANING) ANGELA: Goddamn it. Lita. Come on. Come on. My eyes. You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right. My eyes. Come on. Come on. Go. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Get your fucking hands up. Get... MAYNARD: Fuck you. Ow! (LITA SOBBING) ANGELA: I'm gonna bandage you to stop the bleeding, okay? Put your head back. Oh, God, I'm so stupid. ANGELA: Okay, sweetie, okay. What happened? He promised. He promised he would just leave if I let him out. And you believed him? I didn't know what else to do. Lita, you're gonna have to listen to me if we're gonna make it out alive. Can you do that? Yes. Good. MAYNARD: What about me? I'm bleeding here. ANGELA: Yeah, you're on your own. Oh, I'm gonna enjoy watching you die. Not if you die first. (CHUCKLES) Go ahead. Shoot me again. Get it over with. Don't tempt me. You're a fucking coward. You don't have the guts. I'm gonna be there when they stick a needle in your arm. Yeah. Well, you just go right on telling yourself that, baby. I'm gonna go for help. You stay here and don't do anything, okay? I'm gonna lock the door behind me. You ain't never coming back, bitch. (JASON GRUNTING) Jason? Jason. (MUFFLED SHOUTING) (GROANING) No. Oh, no. Jason. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. (JASON SCREAMING) Oh, God. (HORN HONKING) (THREE FINGER CACKLES) (GRUNTS) (GUN CLICKING) (THREE FINGER CHUCKLES) (GRUNTING) (THREE FINGER CACKLING) I want you to remember this voice, Lita... ...because it's gonna be the last one you'll ever hear. (WHISPERING) I'm gonna whisper in your ear right before I slit your throat... ...which is only a matter of time now. Just shut up. Shut up. (IN NORMAL VOICE) Maybe I won't kill you right away. Maybe I'll keep you alive a little while. Yeah. Because I'm gonna fuck you. No. Ha-ha-ha. Shut up, just shut up! And then my three boys are gonna fuck you. No. (SOBBING) MAYNARD: And then when we're done... ...I'm gonna cut your titties off as a souvenir. LITA: Oh, God. (MAYNARD LAUGHING) MAYNARD: You run away. That makes it more fun. (CHUCKLES) You run, little girl. Because I'm coming to get you. MAYNARD: Well, now, looks like we've come full circle, huh, sheriff? I love irony. Don't you? They'll find you. On, I highly doubt that. We're just fixing to leave town. I hope you burn in hell. Well, now, sorry to disappoint, but you're the one that's gonna burn. All right, boys, that will do it. Now, sheriff, out of the kindness of my heart... ...I am offering you a choice... ...which is real gentleman-like of me, don't you think? Fuck you. Oh. Heh, heh. A fighter to the end, huh? Admirable. Now... ...as I am a man of mercy, let me explain to you what is happening here. I am gonna duct tape this shotgun to your mouth... ...and I have attached a wire to the trigger... ...which is also attached to your foot. So that when you come down off your tippy-toes... ...the wire is gonna pull the trigger. Essentially, I am offering you a way out, sheriff. If I were you, I would take it... ...because burning to death is one painful way to die. You son of a bitch. (LAUGHS) (MUFFLED GRUNTING) Tick tock, sheriff. Gotta go. There, that ought to do it. Now, all you have to do... ...is let go. Heels to the floor and: Boom. No more. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Oh, you don't need to thank me, sheriff. You hang on in there, huh? (MUFFLED SCREAMING) (GUNSHOT) All right, let's get out of here. (SOBBING) (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Stop. Stop. Please. Stop. Help me. Please help me. Help me. Help me. Please help me. Oh, please. Oh, thank God you stopped. They killed my friends. You need to call the police before they kill the sheriff, please. Please help me. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Welcome home, Lita. No! Ha-ha-ha! No! (THREE FINGER CACKLING) (LITA SCREAMING) No! No! (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Tonight you're so far away from home You don't wanna be here But I can't let you go 'Cause time was never on your side And it never will be 'Cause tonight you're mine And I just wanna storm But I know I never will I'm just what you made me to be And I wanna let you go I wanna set you free So just say "mercy" We've wasted so much time And time is what you plead for But I can't give in 'Cause I'm the only one that can Save you from the dark side But I won't let go And I just wanna storm But I know I never will I'm just what you made me to be And I wanna let you go I wanna set you free So just say "mercy" Can you let me go? Can you spare my soul? Can you save my life? Can you say "mercy"? (CHEETAH WHORES' "FORMALDEHYDE" PLAYING) I'm getting on with life Now that we're dead Got a collection Where I keep your severed head I'm still hanging around With your ghost Yeah, I took the notch off The bedpost Liked it better when we were walking But I hated all that talking Now when I stop and think of you My mind starts floating in Formaldehyde Formaldehyde Formaldehyde My mind starts floating in Formaldehyde And I'm still floating in Formaldehyde My mind starts floating in Formaldehyde And I'm still floating in Now my girls don't wanna play I let a good one get away Liked it better when we were walking But I hated all that talking Now when I stop and think of you My mind starts floating in Formaldehyde Formaldehyde Formaldehyde Formaldehyde (English - US - PSDH)
