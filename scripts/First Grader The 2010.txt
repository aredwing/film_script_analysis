A government that keeps its promise? Unbelievable! My son needs to be educated. Kamau Chege, Kamau Chege. Chege! Teacher Jane, Teacher Jane! Come on, he's asking for you. Please! Teacher Katherine! Teacher Katherine, can you come? OK, give me a moment, please. This is not a birth certificate. Mama, you are not the first. May I help you, mzee? This is a primary school. Mzee, they meant children, not adults. No. I heard on the radio, with my own ears. They said everybody. We have 200 students and only 50 desks. Look at this. We can't waste them on an old man with one foot in the grave. Mzee, where are your exercise books? You need two, and one HB pencil, sharp, with a rubber on one end. Those are the regulations. Pole, mzee. Pole. Good morning, boys and girls. Good morning, madam! - How are you? - Fine, thank you, madam! - How do you do? - How do you do, madam? I do very well, thank you. I am so excited to have you here all in my classroom. Welcome. Karibuni. Sit down, please. Thank you, madam. Now, I know that some of you may be a little nervous, but there's nothing to be afraid of. Learning is about having fun, so we are all here to have fun. - Si ndiyo? - Yes. Alright, let me check. Has everybody got their books? - Yes! - Very good! - And has everybody got their pencils? - Yes! - OK. Good... I heard a few noes. - Who said no? OK, well, Francis, can you give out some pencils, please? OK... Paris and Pauline, come to the front, please. So, everyone, tomorrow, your books and your pencils. - Yes. - OK, very good, very good. Sorry, sorry, excuse me. Go home, mzee. I can see you've had a hard life. Go home and rest in peace. Rest in peace? I'm not dead. Look, mzee... My name is Kimani Ng'ang'a Maruge. Well, Kimani Ng'ang'a Maruge, we cannot accept anyone without a school uniform, and that means school shoes too. And you do not have money for such things. Jane? Mzee, why does someone as old as you want to go to school? I want to learn to read. We've got too many pupils already. I wish I could help you. I'm sorry. Pole. Alright, here we are. - OK, asante sana. - Asante. Goodbye, Teacher. You know that old man I told you about? He came back again. I hope you did not let him in. The poor old boy might be senile. Why don't you stick to battles you can win, hm? Like finding more desks. How was your week? The Swedish company hasn't paid me the consulting fee. The government job is starting to sound very appealing. Except it had to be full time in Nairobi, and then we'd never see each other at all. Not if you came to Nairobi. We'll live in a big house, make babies. Have a little bunch of Obinchus. Charles, I can't. The school needs me. What about me? You've got me. We've got five children to a desk here, sir. There are children sitting on the floor. They can't work like this, Mr. Kipruto. You need a form for every single new child, in triplicate? No, you can't be serious. I don't have time to do that, Mr. Kipruto. Could you not just take my word for it? Yes, I know, regulations. Good day to you too, Mr. Kipruto. What am I to do, Alfred? Our esteemed superintendent has made one of his executive decisions. You've got to see this. What? You don't give up easily, do you, Maruge? You can't fall for this. You'll be asking for trouble with the authorities. You know he's right, Maruge? What will I say to the board of education? Hm? What will I say to the parents? I'll be a good pupil. I'll work very hard. If Kipruto finds out... Kipruto's not the head here, Alfred. I am. Let him in. I'm making an executive decision. Let Maruge in. Maruge? Welcome. Karibu. Thank you. Francis, take your seat. Class, we have a new student today, and his name is Maruge. Welcome, Maruge! Jennifer, raise your hand, please. I would like you to go and sit next to Jennifer at the back there, please, Maruge. If I sit far, I won't see. I can't. OK. Uh... Suzanne, can you sit there? Sarah, can you sit next to Niva, please? Maruge, you can sit there. Sit next to Niva, OK, Sarah? Back down. Yes? Good. Let's begin! Open your exercise books. Pencils nice and sharp. Nice and sharp! My pencil is my friend. I keep him to the end. My pencil is my friend. I keep him to the end. OK, we are going to begin with small letters today, beginning with the letter 'A', OK? And this is how we write our small letter 'A'. OK, a fatty, a thinny. A fatty, a thinny. Please continue writing your lower-case 'A's. Brendan, Brendan. Sorry, darling. Maruge, this is how you hold a pencil. OK, you hold it between your thumb and your first finger. Very good. And you press lightly... not too hard, OK? Very good. Good, we are continuing, repeating after me. A fatty, a thinny. A fatty, a thinny. A fatty, a thinny. A fatty, a thinny... Kamau, come here. What's with the old man in uniform? Yeah, he's in our school. Get inside and start working. Come on. F-I-T. A thinny. F-I-T. 'Fit'. F-I-T. A thinny. Maruge! Maruge! Stay out of the school, huh? School is no place for an old man! You don't belong there! Get up. Get up. Get into line! Move! Get out of the way! Move out! Where are they, the Mau Mau? Well done, Peter. Makofi for Peter! Well done, well done, Peter. Try again another day. A wonderful boy! OK, who's going to write for me the number four? The number four? Who is going to write for me? Suzanne. Suzanne, come. Come and write for me the number four. Well done, Suzanne. Makofi for Suzanne, please. Well done, well done, Suzanne! Try again another day. A wonderful girl! A wonderful girl! Very good. OK, next after four is five. Who is going to write the number five for me? Kamau, come and write the number five for us. Come. Come and write the number five so that we all know how to write the number five. Stop it! Is that how we write the number five? No. No, it is not, Kamau. I was just kidding. OK. No more jokes. Excellent! Very good, Kamau. Makofi for Kamau, please. Well done, well done, Kamau. Try again another day. A wonderful boy. OK, Maruge, can you come and write for us the number six? Maruge! Can you come and write the number six for us? Maruge! Hey, stop. Maruge, will you write the number six for us? OK, can someone else write me the number six? Who is going to write me the number six? Good morning, class. Good morning, Teacher Alfred. Teacher Alfred is going to inspect for neatness, yes? OK, sit down, sit down. Thank you, Teacher. Patrick, hm-hm. Good, good, good. Pauline. Good. Good. Where is the date? Good, good, good. Maruge, your pencil's very blunt. What kind of example are you setting? Go sharpen it now and don't let it happen again. Malisa, Malisa, Malisa. Should I help you to hear a little bit better? Like this, Maruge. Maruge? Let's get you some air. - What's wrong with him? - Stay with my class. It wasn't me! What's wrong, Maruge? I think this is all too much for you at your age, Maruge. Maybe you shouldn't be here. It won't happen again. What is that? I was in the camps. You were Mau Mau? Yes. Tell me what happened in the classroom, Maruge. Then I can help you. I must go back to class to finish my work. I was a prisoner. The British stole our land, so we said they must give it back. They told us to be quiet. So we spoke very loud. To some, in 1963. That was uhuru. What does 'uhuru' mean? It's 'freedom'. Freedom! Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Uhuru! - Uhuru! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Uhuru! - Uhuru! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Uhuru! - Uhuru! - Uhuru! - Uhuru! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Uhuru! - Uhuru! What is this? He's going to be a problem, for all of us. Come on! Come outside and start working. Listen, my friend. It doesn't have to be like this. Renounce your oath and you can go home. Renounce the oath! Again. People, my people. I'm hearing rumblings that an old man has actually gone back to school. An old man going back to school! Unbelievable. Excellent work. Come, Kamau. Let's see what you have done. Your one's very good. Very good, very good. Your fives again, Kamau. Did we not go over this? Yes. So why have you written them the wrong way again? Hm? You have to write them again, Kamau. - Sawa? - Yes, Miss. Maruge? Excellent. You are good with your numbers, Maruge. Excellent work. Very good. I'm very happy with you. Come, Francis. Let's take a look at what you have done. Oh, I like that. Your work is always very neat. You're a very clever boy. OK. Excellent. Because you have done so well, you're going to get a star. Ow! You're hurting me! Ow! Maruge! You do not hit him! Honestly, ladies tell me Kikuyus have mad blood, but their back story's another one. Kikuyus work like stallions. They're very... Maruge, stop it! Maruge! - Stop it! - Hey! Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here? I couldn't believe my ears when I got a phone call from the press telling me about an old man in one of my primary schools! Who is he? Why is he in school uniform? His name is Maruge. Mzee. He wanted to come to school, so I let him. What do you mean? This is a primary school. Sir, the government said everybody has the right to go to school. Just because our politicians are stupid doesn't mean we have to be as well! He can't stay here. Adults must go to the adult school. Now, see to it that he leaves here now. Sir, he fought the British. - He was imprisoned in the camps. - Oh, Mau Mau, huh? Typical Kikuyu. I should have known. Excuse me? I thought tribalism was over. This has nothing to do with tribalism. It's about doing what's right for the school. An old man like him does not belong in a classroom full of children. Now, we'll continue this conversation in the office. Maruge... He's a bloody Kalenjin. You too, Maruge? You know, after independence, we all became Kenyans. The Kalenjins were loyalists! So were my family loyal to the British! So was everybody if they wanted to stay alive! And don't look at me like that. The British never gave people a choice. You were either for them or you were against them, and if you were against them, they killed you. I had children. Two children! I had a family! The British killed them. We chose. The Kikuyus chose. And we paid. We paid! Come to class. Come to class, come to class, come to class. Go to class, go to class. He says I've got to get rid of Maruge. He's sending him off to the adult school. Where is his compassion? Jane, Jane, just stop. That's not what he's saying. He's just saying Maruge cannot go to children's school. Why are you defending him? The British killed his family. We have a duty to help him. The Mau Mau killed people too, OK? But that's got nothing to do with an old man going to a children's school. Fine. No-one's going to fight for Maruge, so I will. OK, please do not go over Kipruto's head. I work with these people and I know how they are. They won't take kindly to this. You know I'm always on your side. - Love you. - 'Bye. I appreciate your concern, but my hands are tied. Maruge is such a hard worker. He's a great role model for the children. If we let Maruge in, how can we refuse others? Our schools could be flooded with old people. This would be taking away from the precious resources we need for our children. Thank you for your time, Madam Secretary. You're welcome. Mrs. Obinchu, one of the consultants working with the Danish Government, Charles Obinchu. Charles is my husband. - Give him my best. - I will. Mrs. Obinchu, the children are Kenya's future. I'm sorry, Maruge. I have no money, no money. There's nothing for free. You cannot go, you're too old. So today we're focusing on singular and plural. Let's start with 'bed', alright? So, 'bed', the plural for 'bed' is 'beds'. That's B-E-D-S. Alright, so you just add an 'S'. Alright, now, the plural for 'lamp'... Please. The plural for 'lamp'... Alright, how about 'death'? The plural for 'death'... - Kwa heri! - Asante! See you later, Teacher. Maruge, what are you doing here? Come inside. I took the oath to get our land back from the British. Maruge, you don't have to tell me this. What is Kikuyu without land? The Masai, it's cattle. But for us, it's land. That's why we were fighting. But we are nothing if we cannot read. We are useless. When I was a boy, there was no money for education. I worked on a white man's farm. Then came the fight for freedom. Maruge... I have a letter. What do you mean? That's why I came to the school. I must read it for myself. I have to understand. Please. Teach me to read, Mrs. Obinchu. Well, I know we've had this conversation many times before about Maruge, but I was wondering if you might be willing to reconsider. Mr. Kipruto, they just mess around at the adult school. He didn't learn a thing. Yes. Yes, of course I'm grateful. Kwa heri. Maruge, I'm very sorry. I've done everything... That bloody Kipruto can go to hell! The adult school is better than nothing... I'm not going! He's Kalenjin. His people were in bed with the British. Bloody loyalist! I'm not going. Not me! Let him go to the other school himself! # A, B, C, D # E, F, G, H # I, J, K, L # M, N, O, P # Q, R, S, T... # # U, V, W # X, Y, zeddy, zeddy # A, B, C, D # E, F, G, H # I, J, K, L # M, N, O, P # Q, R, S, # U, V, W # X, Y, Z, zeddy # X, Y, Z. # Now, class, please sit down. I came to say goodbye. I told them a goat cannot read. A goat cannot write his name. They must study hard, or they'll be like me... an old man no better than that goat. You know, goats are very clever animals. They never give up. We can learn a very good lesson from them. Class, I have an important announcement. From now on, Maruge is going to be my teaching assistant. Well done, well done, Maruge. I'm impressed. How did you get them all to behave so well? I told them if they didn't behave, I'll clobber them with my stick. Maruge! Wait a minute, there's Mr. Maruge! There's Mr. Maruge. Mr. Maruge, Mr. Maruge. Alright, alright! Please, please, if we're going to do this, let us at least do it in an orderly way. If you want to speak to Maruge, one question at a time. His hearing is poor. Please. Mr. Maruge, CNN Washington. Mr. Maruge, why didn't you go to school when you were younger? There was no free education for black people when Maruge was a boy. What is the motivation now? What did he say? He says, "The power is in the pen." To read and understand, it's very important. This is one way of finishing poverty among us. And the Bible... I don't trust those preachers in the churches. Who does? Mr. Maruge, BBC London. Is the Kenyan Government doing enough for education in this country? Yes, yes... free education! For all. Mr. Maruge, NTV Nairobi. Do you think this is right? She's just drawing attention to herself and the school. It's not right for anybody. Alfred. Hey? You are the most negative person I know. This is a good thing for the school. Just relax. People, the world has gone absolutely mad. And look, 'New York Times', 'L.A. Times', 'Kenya Times', all the 'Times', BBC, 'Daily Telegraph'. The world is finally talking, "Maruge, Maruge!" And not to forget the teacher who took Maruge to school at 84 years. It's absolutely crazy! Now, this mzee was once a Mau Mau veteran, war fighter, who wanted Kenya to say... 'Can'. Now, despite his age, he too is demanding free education and head teacher Jane Obinchu has welcomed him through the doors. Many parents are outraged and feel that such a valuable place should not be wasted on such an old man. And, as feelings run increasingly high, this controversy is no doubt set to grow. Habari yako? You don't care about our children. You only care about yourself. You want your face in the newspapers so that you can fill your pockets with money. How dare you say that to me! Every single child is important to me, including your son. - Habari yako, Polo? - Mzuri. Mau Mau... have you seen? The title? Have you seen that? Have you seen the title? Gone back to school. - How old are you? - 55. I don't want my son being mixed with old men! OK, everybody, please. I know that you are all upset. Please, would you listen to me? I think that we have a lot to learn from Maruge. He's helping us. OK? The children have a lot that they can learn from the old. I don't want him to teach my son, huh? Who is he? Who is he? Where is the teachers? Now look at this. Surely. What do you think you're doing? You're running a circus! I told you to get rid of that old man. You know what, Mr. Kipruto? Why don't you just come clean? Is it because Maruge is old or is it because he's Kikuyu that you don't want him here? This is not about tribes, Mrs. Obinchu! Who do you think you are, dictating the agenda? You're an employee. You do as I tell you. Now, I'm warning you one last time. He goes to the adult school! He's got no money, Mr. Kipruto. He can't go to school anywhere else. He will have money soon. This Kikuyu government is going to give the Mau Mau compensation money. Compensation for what? For killing their own people? Mr. Kipruto... ...can't we just put the past behind us? The past is always present, Mrs. Obinchu. Never forget that. Maruge. Ask her. Ask her, is this her husband? Ask her, Kikuyu? Take the child off her. Take this baby off her. Hey, Kamau. Look. Look at his grades. He can't keep up with the others. Meaning that my son is stupid? I'm not saying that your son is stupid, Mr. Chege. All I'm saying is that in our school there's a certain level of attainment that he needs to achieve in order to move on to the next class. Otherwise, he repeats the same class or goes to special school. My son has a right for free education! Do I make myself clear? I understand perfectly, Mr. Chege. We're helping him in every way we can. You are not helping him! Huh?! You're busy wasting your time with that stupid old man. Look, I'm running a shop, huh? And my son must be extremely good in mathematics and science. This is not fair and this is not right! Mr. Chege, I... We'll deal with this when you get home. Well, I guess we know he can dance. How's he getting on in the classroom? His maths is good, but he really came here to read, and it needs a lot more work. It's about finding time for everyone. Come, come, come. Back to class! Let's go to class. OK, Maruge, sound this for me. - And put it together... - 'Sat'. Wonderful! Very good. 'Bat'. Well done, Maruge. That is very good, very good. OK, let's move on to the next one. - Together? - 'Cat'. Excellent, Maruge. Very good. Kamau? We are working here. Please go away. School is over. Please go home. Come, come. 'Mat'. Oh, Maruge, you have done so well. Very good! OK, let's go over our sounds and then we'll finish there for today, OK? 'Ah', 'buh', 'kuh', 'duh'... - Hello? - Jane Obinchu? Yes? So now you are giving private lessons to the old man, eh? Who is this? We are watching you. We know you are alone in that house. You'll want to take care. Walalaa! Hoo, hoo, hoo. Wa wa wa wa! Now, that's called money on wheels... mobile money. Politicians... what do they want now? When I grow up, that's the kind of car I'd like to drive, but not as a politician. # Welcome, everybody # It's good to see you here # Welcome, everybody # It's good to see you here # Welcome here today # Welcome, everybody # It's good to see you here... # Welcome. We are honoured to have you here. - Greetings from Nairobi. - Asante. - How are the kids? - Very good, very good. # It's good to see you here... # This is wonderful! You have put us on the map, Mrs. Obinchu. - And we are very grateful. - Asante. No water, no electricity and right in the middle of nowhere. David, bring the sweets. Mr. Maruge, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Asante. You are doing us proud. Hello, you young ones! Mrs. Obinchu? Can we talk? Yes, of course. So what is our cut? Excuse me? Look, don't act stupid with me, bitch. The press are giving you money for Maruge. I want my share. # It's good to see you here # Welcome, everybody # It's good to see you here # Welcome, everybody... # I've got politicians turning up at school. One of their aides thinks the press are giving me money for Maruge. He threatened me. What did you say to him? - I told him to leave. - Oh, Jane. You must be careful. You're butting heads with powerful people. What did you expect me to do, Charles? You should be in Nairobi with me. I can't protect you when you're there. OK. I'm coming home. I'll cancel my meetings for tomorrow. Thank you. Charles? I'm sorry. I love you. OK. Yes? Charles Obinchu? Yes. Hold on a minute. Yes? Do you know how your wife spends her evenings when you're not there? Maybe you don't mind if she has a boyfriend, eh? We know those newspaper people gave you some money. We want a share. What money? I have no money. - Old man... - Leave me alone! Go to the school and teach Maruge a lesson. Make sure and make no mistake. Scare him away from here for good. No mistakes! You don't hurt the children. Am I clear? - Yes. - Today we are doing it. Yes! Who are the lions on my team? Yes! Who are the elephants on Maruge's team? OK, are you ready? Are you set? Let's go! OK, quick, so we can beat... Get away from the window! Get away from the window! Sit down, everybody. Sit down! Francis! Get away from the window! Get away! Get down! What's going on here? You think you can do anything to me? What can you do? What can you do? Let's go, let's go. The old bull is crazy. Let's go, let's go! Leave him! Leave him! Let's go, man. Let's go! - Go away! - Stay there, Kamau. You can do nothing. This is getting out of hand, Maruge. We are alright. It's nothing wrong. They won't come back. I'm OK. I'm alright. Just a few people I've just annoyed. It's OK. - Are you OK? - I'm fine. "Long neck, "tummy fat, "number 5 wears a hat." Can you imagine that, Kamau? A man with a long neck and a big tummy, fat, and wears a hat! "Long neck, "tummy fat, "number 5 wears a hat." Good. Now I want you to try it. "Long neck, "tummy fat... "...number 5 wears a hat." Very good, Kamau. Very good! Want to try it again? Yeah, good. "Long neck... "...tummy fat, "number 5 wears a hat." Great! You sure you can do it? - Are you sure? - Yes. Yes, I know you can! And I knew you could! Yes. - For me? - Yes. Thanks, Jonas. - I can't believe this. - Hmm? He's transferred me. What? Where to? Turkana is 300 miles away from here. How are we supposed to see each other? You're not taking that transfer, and that's clear. Well, I'm not resigning, Charles. I refuse to give Kipruto the satisfaction as a matter of principle. To hell with principle! They are throwing bloody rocks at the classroom. They transfer you. I'm having problems at work. Can't you see what this thing is doing to us? So, what do you want me to do, Charles? Hmm? Go quietly and shut up, like a good Kenyan woman? "Women must be seen and not heard," is that it? You are seen, trust me. You are seen! Seen? Are you accusing me of something? Jane, people are beginning to talk. I get phone calls day and night, telling me things. That you're having an affair. Are you? Are you having an affair? How low can they go? How far are you willing to take this, Jane? Why are you risking everything because of this old man? Just let it go. Let it go. You know what the simple answer is, Charles? I just don't have any way to turn him away. I'll go to Turkana. But I'm not resigning. I'm not giving in to them. - Karibu. - Asante. Tell me your mind. I go with you to Turkana. I'll go to school there. No, thanks, Maruge. I don't want any more battles. Turkana is far. What about your husband? He'll stay in Nairobi. He's very busy. We've been apart so much we're used to it, yeah? You're suffering because of me. No. It's my decision. I think I'm too old to learn. My father had a saying. He wasn't an educated man. He was a fisherman. But he said, "Learning never ends until you have got soil in your ears." What was your father's tribe? Kisii. From the lakes. Good people. Wow! That was a long time ago! A handsome man, Maruge! And your wife, she's very beautiful. Yes. Thank you for the tea, Maruge. I will see you tomorrow for my last day. You know, my mother never went to school. But she said to me, "Jane, you must love education, "because I want you to be better than me." Now, I am your mother, and I am telling you all you must love education... ...so that you can be better than me and all of us teachers here. - Si ndiyo? - Ndiyo. Good. Some of us have bought gifts for Teacher Jane. Can I see them? OK, Faith. Would you like to start us off? Oh! A bracelet! Thank you so much. These are just for you, Teacher Jane. Have you seen Maruge? No, I haven't seen him. - Good morning, children. - Good morning, sir. Children, I am Mr. Kipruto, and I'm pleased to announce the appointment of the new head teacher, the new mwalimu mkuu, who will take the place of Teacher Jane. The new head teacher has shown loyalty and dedication to the education of children and we feel is greatly deserving of this promotion. I expect you to show your full support for Mrs. Grace Muthumba. She'll be joining us this afternoon. So in the meantime, I'll be standing in her place. I used to be a teacher. So we'll have fun, right? Yes. Alright, children. And then you've got class. And then you've got class. No running! No running, no running, no running, no running. Let's go, let's go, let's go. I need to go to the city. You're going to the city? Let's go. - That's my fare. - What? What am I going to do with a goat, Maruge? You can breed more goats. - Oh, come on, Maruge. - I've got to get to the city quickly. That's not fair. Maruge, next time you need to get hard cash. Free education is messing you up, Maruge. She's here! Hello! So many faces. Come on. You get the padlock. Faster, faster, faster. Move back! Go back. Go back, go back. OK, throw. Throw! We want Teacher Jane! We want Teacher Jane! We want Teacher Jane! We want Teacher Jane! Teacher Jane! Maruge, your damn goat is peeing on everyone here! Hey, what's that? You're an idiot for going back to school. This celebrity culture has gone too far now! You, stop that, now. No! Look at them! I can't handle such indiscipline! They're just... little children! They're just little... Hey, we can take care of them! - No! - Grace, please! They're just little kids! We want Teacher Jane! We want Teacher Jane! Sorry! Grace! Grace! Wow, karibu! This is where everybody is. But don't worry, we have a better place, alright? There's no demonstration. So many people are doing their business, Maruge. Watch out, watch out! When you get lost here, just raise your ID. Wah-wah! Nairobi, here we come. This is Nairobi! Got the old guy from the education campaign here with me in reception. He wants to see the chairman. OK, thanks. Excuse me. The chairman is busy. Would you like to see the deputy chairman? - No. - Oh... alright. Then I'm afraid you'll have to wait. I don't want to wait. You're gonna have to. Hey, Jacquie, I need the chairman to sign this. No, sorry, he's in a meeting and I cannot disturb him. But I need it right now. OK, do this... leave it with me, then I'll see what I can do. - OK, but make it ASAP. - Sure. Hey, sir! Wait! Please wait! So, where do we go from here? Mr. Chairman, I still insist that we should go to Kilifi. We have the money! Wait, sir! Old man, you can't go in... I am so sorry, Mr. Chairman. I'm gonna go and call security. What is this? Sir, this is Mzee Maruge. Mr. Maruge. What can we do for you? I'm here for a teacher. - Sir, shall I... - No, that's alright. Thank you. You have our attention, sir. I was in the detention camps with our founding fathers. These men sacrificed everything for your generation. Without them, you'd not be here. Before, it was only the Queen's face there. The British did this to me. They cracked my skull. They chopped off my toes. Mr. Chairman... Mr. Maruge, that's enough. We have to learn from our past. We must not forget. But we must be better.
