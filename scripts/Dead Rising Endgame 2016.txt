Because that only makes it harder to get people the accurate information they need. East Mission, Oregon will be the third major outbreak in the United States. Large stores of the antidote drug Zombrex have contained the process, though of thousands remain trapped. The President has called in the military, and the Army has stopped all evacuation efforts and sealed the city. 25,000 civilians and first responders still trapped inside the zone with little hope of rescue... The military construction of a quarantine wall -without authorization. -Liberals in Congress objecting strongly to what many are calling... a quarantined wall completed in record time. East Mission is now the most dangerous infected zone in the world. Despite objections, all control of homeland defense handed to the military. We've worked very closely with Phenotrans to improve how we treat the infected people. We will implant them with these. This chip contains highly concentrated supply of Zombrex. Chip implantation is now mandatory for all infected americans. More than one and a half million americans now carry the Zombrex chip. Fear of a new outbreak runs high. The Army gains the power of arrest and detention. The rash of unexplained disappearances... Some websites claiming that more than 300 people are now unaccounted for. Chase, do you hear me? Journalist Chase Carter... Frantically searching for his producer. -Jordan Blair. -Jordan Blair. Jordan Blair disappeared during the outbreak. Vanished while reporting on Army corruption. Many believe she was the first victim... -Without proof of a larger conspiracy... -With Congress subdued... and the public more terrified of zombies than they are of the Army, the only resistance are those brave enough to report. Where are the missing persons? Jordan! Where's Jordan Blair? Where's Jordan Blair? Come on! What? -Are you fucking kidding me? -Kid's a walking disease bag. No different from the rest of these motherfuckers. I'm just not all that cool about what's about to happen. You'll learn. Don't think about it too much, all right? We're transport. Just transport. In this goddamn town, that's trouble enough. Chase, we gotta get out of here. There's fucking Zs everywhere, man. We're not going anywhere until I get what you promised me. You said your guys would be here. Where are they? They'll be here. Trust me! They better be. Shit. How's the feed? You in yet? Yeah. Piece of cake. We hear you, Chase. How about some picture. Gotcha. There they are. There they are. See I told you they'd be here. I told you they'd be here. I can't see inside. There they are. That's part of the deal. Yeah, well, we're doing a Missing Persons piece, so if I can't see the goddamn hostages, we don't have a story. Where are they taking them? How am I supposed to know? All I know is that they don't come back. Here's your money. You can't leave me here alone. You'll be fine. I'm going in. Wait, what? Chase, don't go in there. I gotta get the exchange on camera. Goddammit, does he listen to anyone? You're dating him. Not this week. Shit. Look who it is. Tell me you're getting this. General Alan fucking Lyons. General. To what do we owe the honor? How are things going for you, Skinner? Getting everything you need? We're fine. -You know what I need? -Who are the prisoners? I want my covert ops to remain covert. You exist to provide a pipeline for Leo Rand. An invisible pipeline. When you become visible, your reasons for existing end. Chase, what the hell are we looking at? You really think I'm that stupid? Well, that's the reason for the visit. To make sure you understand the importance of not being stupid. I don't know yet. Would I ever let you down? You know, I don't mind that your product pays for our operations. I've seen worse. General Lyons is allegedly supposed to be in Washington DC all week. You hacked his personal schedule? Want to know what he had for breakfast? My people also tell me that you have a problem moving more bodies. That deal was supposed to end weeks ago. None of us have been thrilled about moving your prisoners. Afterlife is close now. This may be the last group you move through the zone. What the hell is going on here? All right. What happens to our little agreement once... Let me go! Let me go! Found this one outside. He got this with him. One of yours? Fuck me! Anybody else out there? Nah, he's by himself. Hey! Have you talked to anyone? No, no, I swear, I did not. Look, I just came back to work. Okay? I needed the money. I just wanted the work. I just wanted the work. He's seen this. He's seen me. Hey! No guns. Hey, you're all right. You're one of us. Fuck. Chase! Chase, get out of there. Get out of there now. Hey, Skinner. Skinner, there's someone up there. Handle it. -I got it. -Chase, get to the pickup. Shit! Take note of all present, Captain. Once Afterlife is executed... this pipeline needs to be sanitized. Yes, sir. Fuck. My God. Shit. Do you see him? What? Nothing. Let's try over here. He's on the street! Let's go! You gotta be kidding me. Shit. Shit. I'm getting too old for this shit. My God. Don't do that to me, okay? Don't do that to me. Don't you ever do that to me again! You scared the shit out of me! Now get in the car! Let's go! Drive. Go, go, go! We can't run this. You mean, you're too afraid to run it? The lawsuit here would bury this network. Now the lawyers tell us what's the news? Everything runs through my office. Don't waste your time unless this is air-tight. You screw this up and the Army will own our ass. You pussy. Thank you. We got Lyons involved in a possible human trafficking ring, and complicit in a murder execution. What more do you need? Forget the lawyers for a second. You want to accuse a two-star general of murder and go toe-to-toe with the US military over some dark footage and crappy audio? Do you want to be the next person who disappears? I'll take my chances. Yeah, I'm not going to put this program and my A-team in the military cross hairs. It's my job to protect my reporters, even from themselves. So we what? We sit on this? We do another propaganda puff piece on Phenotrans humanitarian efforts? People's lives and reputations are on the line and you don't even have a story yet. Who are those prisoners? Who the hell is Leo Rand? What the fuck is Afterlife? They're abducting people. And they killed someone! My source. Our source. But apparently, I'm the only one in this room with the balls to do something about it. No offense, Jill. You're outta control, Chase. You're a journalist or a vigilante? Because you seem more interested in chasing ghosts than facts. Or have you forgotten what happened to your last partner? Hey! Don't even go there! Jordan Blair is gone, Chase, and she's never coming back. You don't know that. You don't know that! Chase. Chase! You know, I could've used a little support back there. Don't give me that shit. You know I support you more than anyone else. Look, are we a team or am I just along for the ride, because this one-man crusade is really starting to look like a suicide mission? You know I'm invested in this. You know I would love nothing more than to watch these guys burn to the ground, but I won't watch you get yourself killed. And if that's what you're going to do, then you have to do it on your own. Beer? Yeah. Collins was right. I was so hell bent on getting a story, I didn't see how my actions could hurt other people. Sandra will get over it. Not Sandra. Jordan. She told me not to go into that tent, and I did it anyway. I left her. Chase, it's not your fault. We know that Phenotrans is responsible for the East Mission outbreak. That the US Army covered it up. But I failed. Lyons was never held accountable. And Phenotrans has only grown stronger. I mean, this is like, Iran-Contra all over again. The US military is using drug dealers to do their dirty work. -And people are disappearing. -Yes. This is the reason why I got into Journalism. To break stories like this. You said it yourself we need to go back in. You're the only one crazy enough to do it. So when you're done being a little girl... you let me know. Hey, I don't have a lot of time to explain, you're in a lot of danger right now. You should come with me. Yeah, I'm going home, buddy. I know who you are. You're Chase Carter. I know what you saw. Afterlife. Who the hell are you? I'm George Hancock. As of a couple hours ago, I was a senior exec at Phenotrans. Come and take a look. Yes, sir, I believe so. Fuck me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come with me. This way. This way. All right, you're with me. Chase Carter! Jesus! No, no! Come on, this way! This way! Up here! Up here! -Come on. Come on. -Cover the back! Cover the back! Shit! Come on! Come on. This way. What the fuck's Afterlife? It's their logical conclusion of Project Watchtower. Phenotrans developed it. Military controls it. And you've seen too much already. Carter! Fuck! Hurry up! Come on! Get in the back! Get in the back! Son of a bitch! -Captain? -We missed him, sir. It looks like someone warned him. Find out who. Yes, sir. Extreme prejudice, Captain. Understood? Of course. Thanks. How'd they know where to find me? They know everything, man. Phenotrans got a hold of that footage you sent to the network, it caused quite a panic. What's Phenotrans' involvement? They're secretly funneling drugs to the outside in exchange for test subjects. Like test subjects? You mean people who are infected? No, not necessarily. They need to know that Afterlife works under real life conditions, right? So the Army, they just seize whoever they want. Claim they turned Z, who's gonna argue with that? Everyone who's infected has a chip, right? It carries one to three years of Zombrex. Released daily it prevents the user from becoming a zombie. Released all at once... -Overdose. -Exactly right. So Phenotrans can kill anyone with a chip? We designed it. As a failsafe. If you had a problem, you could prevent an outbreak just with the push of a button. Genocide. Mass murder. That was the Army, that wasn't us. Once they had the tech, they wanted to use it. Kill the host... Kill all the hosts, the virus dies along with it. No more virus, no more zombies. The greatest existential threat in human history vanishes with the flip of a switch. That's Afterlife. We're talking about roughly one and a half million people. So when's this supposed to happen? The clock's ticking. Chip activation is set for 7:00 pm tomorrow. Now listen, Afterlife is essentially a software. It's controlled from a secret base inside East Mission City. I need to get there and shut those servers down. Why'd you come to me? I hear you've been going inside the wall for months. You are the only person outside the Army who can get me in there. Jesus. Sandra, don't talk, just listen. You need to get out of your house. Get Jill and meet me at G's. You know where it is. And don't say anything to anyone. Who the hell is Chase Carter? He's a reporter. Why? You think you're the only one with spies? He knows about Afterlife. -How do you know this? -I run a trillion dollar company. If a story could harm Phenotrans, I hear about it. Absolute secrecy was one of the conditions of our involvement. I'm shutting the project down. No. We launched already. That was a huge mistake. No, building Afterlife and not using it, that would be the mistake. If only a small portion of the carriers read some conspiracy theory and removed their chips, -the program fails. -I won't allow it. Well, a trillion dollars buys a lot of things. But the power to give me orders is not one of them. Chase Carter has forced our hand. Take 'em. Take 'em. Get your fight out! Jesus. I need a favor, but it's dangerous, and the Army is all over our ass. Sounds like fun. Mi casa es su casa. Ladies. Who's this shady looking, dude? He's cool. George Hancock. Doesn't help. Get in here, man. I just ran a background check on him. He is who he says he is. This guy has been ex-Phenotrans for what? Five minutes? How are we supposed to trust him? Look, if what he says is true, we need him. You don't have to like me, man. But are you willing to stand by and let a million and a half people get murdered? How about you? How are you going to feel if someone you love is chipped? I am chipped, so... You'll forgive me if I'm reluctant to hop into bed with one of the assholes that made them. You know they're tracking that. I made a few modifications. They're not seeing me. Thanks for the warning. -How long? -24 hours. That started 11 hours ago when you pulled that little stunt at the warehouse. I don't like this, Chase. But I like you. Screw it. This guy stinks. Friends don't let friends go through Z town alone. That's what I'm talking about. Besides, I still owe you for that thing. Not after this. What choice do we have? What's the plan? Straight from the source. This is our access point. It's the safest route I know. We need to stay underground as long as possible, and get across the city as fast as we can. The server farm is located right here. It's an old VA hospital right in the middle of the quarantine zone nine miles from the wall surrounded by 15,000 infected. If we get across the city, we're going to access the building through Ward C. I've got the pass code which will get us in through the emergency exit. Then we're going to head up to the fourth floor, where the server farm is located. You gotta understand now that Afterlife needs 24 hours to sync all of the chips, so it can administer the overdose to every carrier all at once. That's our window. Once we're inside, we need to take care of the tech to monitor the system. There's two doctors and 11 guards to provide security to the whole building. So we'll need to find a way around them, too. They get people thinking that the wall was built to keep the zombies contained, but I know the wall was built to protect the server farm. Once we're done, we'll have Chuck extract us with his chopper. His daughter has a chip. He'll want to help. Okay, so, what do we do when we get there? Just blow it up? No, no, no, no. You destroy those servers, Afterlife is triggered immediately. We need to get in there and shut the service down, freeze 'em up. So we freeze 'em with some sort of virus or malware. Yeah. You think you can swing it? As soon as I understand the system's architecture, yeah. I should be able to handle it. Here you go. Straight from the source. I had a bad feeling about this right from the get-go. I thought I'd snatch that up and keep it for myself. 13 hours. We better get going. I think I can do this. I'll call you back. Carter's source is George Hancock. He works for you. George Hancock? Check his home and office right now. Destroy him or discredit him immediately. Call off Afterlife. You can't pull the trigger with Hancock on the loose. We're talking about the survival of the human race. If push comes to shove, I will stand before the american people and explain why it was necessary. Hancock knows we created the first outbreak. Are you prepared to tell the american people you destroyed an entire city, so you could take control of Homeland Security? Call it off. Put your dog on a leash and then we'll talk options. And show some goddamn respect. Where the hell is George Hancock? Hey, Jill. I need someone on the outside. Bullshit, I'm coming with you. Aside from everything else, this is a huge story. Somebody needs to make sure it gets out. No matter what happens... -Don't talk like that. -We gotta go. Call Chuck. Make sure he's standing by with his chopper. And watch your back. You might have to hold the handle down a couple of seconds for it to flush. Hey, just so you know, my daughter's chipped. How'd you get yours? Fortune City. Second outbreak. I was in Army Intelligence with a quick response unit. There to hack websites, block reports, jam the media the brass didn't like. Desk job, right? Well, zombie outbreak isn't the kind of party you want to arrive at early. Anyway, the Army ran me out. So I went freelance. Until Chase found me. He was the first guy in years that didn't treat me like a leper. Made me go legit. Bastard. How's our connection? We're good. You sure you're girl's up for this? She's good to go. You sure you can get us in that hospital? I have the access code to the emergency exit. We're good. Well, okay then. Security access. Connects the old and new systems. Through here, we're on the inside. Come on. Stay close to Garth. Here we go. How far until we reach anything hostile? A mile, hundred yards. Behind that corner. Yes, sir. In position. Move through. Move through. Breaching. Go! Clear. Find out what's on his laptops. Tell me you have Chase Carter in custody. I'm afraid not. We'll sweep for intel. I'd like to expand our ask to the rest of his team. I don't think we have a choice. Thank you, sir. Central, this is Smith, I'd like to add two new targets. Garth O'Toole and Jill Eikland. They're both newly infected and are under high risk to turn. They don't have chips or access to Zombrex. Lethal force is authorized. Shit. This guy wasn't here yesterday. Who would do that? Survivors, gang members. Who knows? Stepping through. -Chase? -Yeah? Maybe I should take point. Be my guest. Wait. What is it? We need another route. Do you know another route? Not as well as I know this one. Let's go, Garth, come on. Sandy, watch our six. Stay tight. I've never seen the network respond like this. They're scared shitless. Will they support us? Well, the Army listed you as infected. There are arrest warrants out. They're freezing your bank accounts. And our lawyers are terrified, they're going to be moving from you guys to the network. This is how they get rid of people. I need you to do something for me. I'm going to draw their attention. I want them fixated on me, not Chase. When they come and check whatever story I tell them, I need you to have my back. You're drawing this to you? That's suicide. You said you have to look out for your reporters. This is how. The network is not going to go for any of this... Not the network! You! I need your help. We need your help. They're coming for us, and we can either lay it down or fight back. Do you have any idea where we're going? Approximately. Hey, you smell that? Yeah, it smells like rotting corpse. No, it's something else. Freeze. Put the guns down. Now! Get your fingers off. -Drop it! -Drop it! Put it down! Let's go. Let's go. Drop it! Hey, hey, hey, what? -Something you want to say? -Take it easy, all right? We're not a threat. We're just passing through. Not yet, you're not. You need to know the password. I'll get you your password right here. Right between my legs. Come, grab it. That's nice. -You like that? -There's a new one? Talking piata. Come here. -I'll fucking... -You might want to let go! -All right. -Good. All right, question the foul mouth. If he doesn't talk, leave his body by the junction. Keep Z distracted for a bit, let's move 'em inside. Let's find out who these assholes are. Move. Hey, guys, help me down, guys. -Let's go. -All right. Move your ass. I'll bite your dick off, you motherfucker. You better hope I never see you again... Zs coming. Can we talk about this? Yeah, let's talk. Good. Get in! Get your ass over there. Who are you? We work for Lyons. Bullshit. You want to piss him off twice in one week? And what do you know about that? I know what he told me. There are a lot of ways a man can die in this city. Z would lick your bones clean before anyone even thought to look for you. That'd be a mistake. Heard you don't like running prisoners. Let us go, you won't have to. No more Rand. No more deliveries. You're taking out the doc? That's right. No. No, I don't think so. No, Rand does the sickest, most twisted shit you seen for years, and nobody says a thing. He's protected even from the military. Who are you, really? -I told you. -Shut up. I'm talking to her. Where are you going, darling? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Leave her alone. Now if he talks again... shoot him. Who the fuck are you? I could do this all day. I'll be honest with you. Ladyboys in Bangkok drove me harder than that. Yeah? Was it something like this? Nice. Very, very nice. Get your fucking hands off me. We're just going to go someplace a little private. I'm going to see what it takes to make her cry. No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'll tell you. I'll tell you. What, did you guys start without me? Chase, Chase, we gotta boogie. Move, move. -Go, go, go! -Let's move! Move it! Go, go, go, go! Move, move! Sandra! Our gear! All of our gear! Did they get the flash drive? -It's in my pocket. -Come on. We gotta get out of here. We gotta move! Come on! They're stopping. What the hell is that? Run! Garth! Chase! Hancock! Attaboy, Chase. -Chase! -Come on, we gotta get out. Come on, we gotta go now! Come on, come on! Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go! Shit. -This way! -Where? Where? Shit, it's locked. Shit. Throw me the wrench. Get that door open! -Hurry! -Come on! -Go, go! -Got it! What the hell were those things? I don't know. But they're going to be a bitch to deal with. Since when do Zs move that fast? Hey, Garth. Garth, man. Are you still okay? Guys, what do you mean by okay? I'll live, baby. I'll live. Garth, shit. You're bit. Let's get you some Zombrex. Shit. I always knew this day would come. Let me take a look. You gotta put pressure on it. Okay... Aargh! It's like... It's like the goddamn things evolved. It had a tattoo on its neck. Like an ID number. That's not evolution. There's only one logical explanation. Phenotrans? I knew nothing about that. You think I would've come down here if I knew they were there? You're the expert. Now we're stuck down here with none of our gear. That was your route. That's on you. -You're blaming this one me? -That was your route. You would be dead if it wasn't for him. I just killed a guy out there, so did you. Those are people, not zombies. That was never a part of the plan. So you'd rather have clean hands and no head? Does that make you feel better? No, it wouldn't make me feel better. It's not what I'm saying. Hey, stop! Stop! First time around I didn't have any gear either. But I survived. We need to remember the reason we're down here. 1.5 million lives. And we're running out of time. We gotta stick together. Right. -I'm sorry, guys. -You're right. It's all right. We need to build some weapons. Miss Ingot? I'm Jill Eikland from UBN. We're running a story on Afterlife within the next 24 hours... George Hancock suffers from severe psychiatric problems including paranoid delusions. He's on medical leave. If you exploit him for ratings, our lawyers will bury you. There are two versions of the story. And one, the Army took your technology and used it to massacre a million people. And the other, Phenotrans built Afterlife from the ground up. Which do you think I should go with? When Lyons comes for you, you're going to need friends. Hey! We'll get there. When we do, what if I can't freeze it? -You're the best hacker I know. -I'm the only hacker you know. Okay, you'll improvise. Look, I know you. You walk around with a chip, act like it's nothing. You're stronger than anyone I know. I hate that I dragged you into this. Chase, you didn't drag me anywhere. I came here on my own. But next time, let's do dinner and a movie? Lyons won't stop. Best case scenario... he kills our customers and doesn't get caught. Phenotrans will be destroyed. Worst case... he finds a way to frame us for it. Decides he doesn't need us anymore. Puts us in whatever shallow grave he dug for those reporters. You think he'd kill you? Do you know what the key to the Phenotrans strength is, Rogers? Not money. Not research or patented technology. It's fear. Zombie terror and the world's utter dependence on us for an antidote. That's how we survive. As soon as Lyons destroys the virus, you will release a new strain from our stock. Rand has gives us a few to choose from. You know, there are a lot worse things than losing a company. Not to me. You think coming in here is going to get you off the hook? With who? Humanity. God, whatever. I don't know. Maybe, yeah. Well, it won't. So I save my sister. Damn sight easier just to dig that chip out of her. Just let another million people die? Bullshit, man. If that's your attitude, what are you doing here? Atonement, same as you. But I'm not kidding myself. I know it's not going to make a lick a difference. What's your problem? My problem is that they might need you. So I can't just put a nail in your head and move on with my life. If we head north, we can reach the VA hospital in about a mile. That sounds about right. Shit. Quick! Get inside. Here. Let's get out of here. Back it up. Shit. We gotta move. Let's go. Fuck me. Chase! Hang on, buddy! -Garth! -Let's go! Head for the door. Head for the door. Head for the door. Chase! Go! Shit. Fuck. Fuck. Let's see if you can fly. Sandra? Sandra! Shit. Jordan? Come with me. My God. Anybody try to follow you? I don't think so. I need you to trust me with something. -What? -Somebody you need to talk to. -You set me up. -No, no, no. -Stop. -Relax. I'm on your side. Couple of years ago, Army decides to start using Zombrex chips as weapons. So they build a Black Ops site inside Mission City, so they can test them and run the program once it's operational. Afterlife? I know this already. Yeah, what you don't know is when the fail safe idea first came up, Ingot and Lyons made a deal, okay? Dr. Leo Rand, who is head of research at Phenotrans, is put in charge of making Afterlife happen. In return, Rand gets to use human test subjects for basically anything he wants to in a secret facility and nobody is watching him. What's he working on? Presumably a cure, but only Ingot would know that for sure. For two years, he's been in there torturing and killing his subjects. But Ingot doesn't want to stop him because she thinks he's on the verge of a breakthrough. She's hoping he hits the jackpot before the Army pulls the plug. Now, this is footage of the tests and documents linking Ingot to them. It's disturbing, it's criminal. But there's more than enough on there to bury her. Why come to me? Ingot's willing to do anything she has to, to save her company, even mass murder. She's reached a line I'm not willing to cross. Phenotrans needs a change of leadership. Right now. Are you okay? What happened to you? They told me you were dead. They said you'd been infected and turned while in custody. And that they were forced to terminate. I didn't believe it. I ran this story with the footage that you left me. But they discredited me. They labeled me a conspiracy theorist. I pushed for an investigation, but they deemed it a matter of national security. And Lyons skated. And everything about Project Watchtower was classified. I failed you. I'm so sorry, Jordan. I found these guys in the hall. Chase! You made it. There are infected... -Are you okay? -Yeah. Where's Garth? Zombrex didn't work. He turned. It's not the same virus. Sandra... meet Jordan. Jordan Blair? I was done for. She came out of nowhere and saved me. Jordan... I'm Sandra. Where have you been? Rand's hospital. There was a breach. Eight of us got out. We're down to two now. You're right about the Zombrex. It doesn't work. We'll be one soon. He's insane, right? Experimenting on healthy human subjects. Injecting them with new strains of the virus. He's created new specimens that are faster, stronger. We were lucky to be part of the control group. But Rand definitely had his favorites. This is going to sting a bit. I hate to be the asshole here, but we're running out of time. Where was that breach? Ward C. Son of a bitch. That was our way in. It's sealed off. We've come up through the tunnels underneath the building. Can you lead us back in? I don't think that's such a good idea. I'm running out of time. We need her, Chase. I can't make her go back in there. It's my fault what happened to her. Over a million lives are at risk and the clock is ticking. This isn't about you or me or her. We have to do something and we have to do it fast, no matter how difficult this may be. A million lives? Yeah. More than a million, actually. Jordan... they're planning on killing everyone... who has a chip. I'll take you. No, no. You don't have to go in there. From here we go in the tunnels. This is it. We're in. Rand keeps his failures on the lower levels. Your servers are above them. Wait here. Come on. They didn't deserve to live. Hey! Who the... Move. Move! How long? If what Hancock told me was correct, not long. Sit down. Okay. Alarms are down. Security should be blind. -Good. -Go. We're in. Okay. What might you be? Okay. This is going to sting a bit. What have we got? Sir, there's a security breach in the Project Afterlife lab. Well, get them out of there. Then lock down the firewall. Chase, Jordan just took off. She just ran. -And you let her go? -I didn't let her go. -What the hell's wrong with you? -I didn't let her go. Am I supposed to be watching her? You think I'm going to derail this? They're onto us. Someone from the outside is sending in counter measures. Shit. You didn't think the Army would notice? Shut up! Can you get past it? Yeah, I think. Fuck. She went after Rand. Sandra, I'm sorry, but I have to go after her. I know how much she means to you. Just go. I'll come back for you. If I beat the clock. You will. It's all very touching. They've got remote access. How can I disconnect them? You're about to kill a million and a half people. People! Not zombies. -They were infected. -You're disgusting. Afterlife may be ugly, but it's necessary. What happens when the next virus hits? And the one after that? You're just going to keep killing people that get sick? If the disease can wipe out my entire family, yeah. We're running out of time. Give me the shortcut. I got a chip in my shoulder and nothing to lose. So you're going to give me root access, and tel me everything I need to know or my last seconds on earth will be spent blowing your head off. But don't worry, Afterlife will still happen just the way you wanted it to. You're willing to kill me to save humanity. Are you willing to make the same sacrifice? None of us want to kill anybody, but I will. There's a Telnet port open in the network security appliance, we use it for local management. Password is West40@Jackson. You can use it to... You can control and stop them from tunneling into the LAN. The thing was never designed to counter an attack from the inside. What's your name? Todd. Thanks, Todd. They're circumnavigating our firewall by island hopping. Dammit. Sir, the attack's coming from inside a local network. -They have physical access? -Yeah. Stop them. This is Lyons. I have a priority strike. The target codename is Eagleride. Destroy immediately. Copy that. Time to target, 15 minutes. Now this is going to sting a bit. When we're done, what's the fastest way to the roof? Fright elevator. Goes direct. You guys are taking me with you, right? If your intel isn't bullshit. They're uploading something to Afterlife. I can't stop it, but I can throttle their upload speed. Do it now. Shit. They're throttling the upload speed. This is taking too long. Way too long. I need to speed this up. Jordan. -Who the hell are you? -I'm the guy who's going to kill you if you don't get the fuck out of my way. I asked you a question. All right, go ahead. Shoot. Set her free. Or... find out why you shouldn't. What'd you give her? What's RXX 22? I'm looking Chase. Another virus? A purpose. Now we all die eventually, but some of us, like her, get a chance to do something meaningful with it. She's not a lab rat. No, that is exactly what she is. And if you disconnect this IV, she will die within two minutes. So just step away. Keep him talking. I have been working with her for two years. For two years, I have been keeping her alive. So fuck off. I die, the cure dies with me. The coin drops. The second this thing is over, I want you to wipe everything. Root directories, everything. -You know the protocol? -Yes, sir. Where are you? We're heading into the containment cell. We believe Carter's there. I understand. Start sanitation procedures immediately. The time is up. Question is this, does she mean more to you than the whole human race? You're not saving people. You're killing them. Afterlife isn't a cure, it's genocide. And you think that is my idea? The Army gave up on finding a cure. Shit. I needed live subjects to better understand the disease. Afterlife was a means of providing them. What, you honestly think things don't die in the name of science? People die. Not her. Not today. Yes, her, today. She's it. This is all coming down. This thing is over. She has the last chance to save the human race. Fuck. All right. If you die here, people will remember you as a monster. I'm a reporter. I can tell your story. What, do you really think I give a shit about what people think? You think this is about ego? If we do nothing, this virus will wipe us all out completely. This is about survival. This is about salvation. Salvation? What salvation? This test, it's meaningless. Okay, because no one is ever going to fucking see it! You know, once they enact Afterlife, they're going to destroy this place. And everything that you have done here will be for nothing. Nothing! Give me the antidote and I will take you and your research out with us. Your results, your data, whatever you want? Jesus Christ, Rand, you're killing her. Yeah, I'm trying as hard as I goddamn can and I hope I fail. Because if she survives death, then there is hope. Best thing about this virus... victims can't die. This is going too slow. We're screwed. Hancock! Son of a bitch. Where others saw disease... I saw a miracle. With small adjustments to the RNA, the virus, in theory, could co-exist with human tissue. And that is a permanent form of regeneration. Cells that never die. You're talking about immortality. That is the cure. And she is the research. The only way to test it is to kill the subject. You really are fucking crazy. Hancock, what are you doing here? There it is. Chase, have you ever had a trillion dollars in your hand? Me neither. Why? Eternal life. Endless money. Jordan. Chase, the antidote is R-E-D 1. We are so screwed. Do you have a tool box? You can't manually speed up a network. I said, do you have a fucking tool box? In there. Shit. Shit. We gotta go. We gotta go now. Chase, we're about to have company. Where are we on the hack? I'm down to the wire. You said you'd take me with you, we gotta get to the roof. Let's go! Yeah. Jeez. Are you fucking kidding me? It's not personal. -Fuck you. -We'll die if we stay here. Shit. We're wasting time. We gotta go. We gotta go now. We gotta get to the roof. You're wasting time! Goddamn it. You can't beat it. Let's save ourselves at least. Come on, you bastard. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! Let's go! We gotta go! We gotta go now. I can't hold them off. Yes! Fuck! You can't save them. You're wasting time. We gotta go. -Yes! -Goddammit! Destroy it! Destroy it all. Affirmative. Locking on coordinates. Fuck. -Jordan. -Yes, Chase. Can you run? -Yeah. -Yeah? Yeah. Shit. Chuck! One minute to target. Let's go! Target acquired. Thanks, Chuck. Are you kidding me? After what you did for my daughter? Thank you. George Hancock? Leave him. Something will come along and eat him soon enough. Yes, sir. Submaster
