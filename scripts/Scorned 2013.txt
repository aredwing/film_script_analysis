Does love die? Morning, Kevin. Who do you love? What are you doing? I'm loving you the way you love me. What do you mean? Gave you a little bit of meds while... Ow. Ow. you were sleeping. That'll keep you calm and cooperative and a little loopy. Don't worry about that. What, is this the fourth one? You know, I didn't want to put your cell phone in the dryer. You text a lot, but you really should use your delete key a little more often. All right, give me that. What are you... You want to tell me something? What's that? What are you... okay. That's... okay, this is cute. Um... that's my phone. - Okay. - Uh-huh. You... are a cheater. I got you. What's this say? "I'm going 2 tell Sadie it's over this weekend. " When were you going to tell me, honey? When were you going to tell me it's over? After we were making love a million times? After I sucked your dick? - Whoa, shush, shush. All right. - What part of this weekend... what part of this weekend were you going to tell me? Um... I know, okay? I made some texts, and they're fucking stupid texts. Yeah, they're stupid. Here's one stupid text for you now. That's a dumb thing to fucking do. I'm going to read this to you real quick. Last Friday, you text, - "I miss your magic pussy. " - You got to... What's magic about it, honey? Does she pull rabbits out of it? What the fuck happened to my head? You scorned me, Kevin. Oh, baby, I'm... I'm sorry. - You took my heart... - I'm really sorry. and you... - you broke my heart. - I'm sorry. And you did it with my best friend Jennifer! I'm sorry, baby. You're the girl I've been dreaming of - You're the girl... - That one's on me, rainbow. Thank you, handsome. That's, like, the second drink he's given you on the house. Well, when you got it, you got it. Let the bartender know I'm the one without the boyfriend. Yes, well, I'll be without a boyfriend after this weekend. He'll be my fianc. Really? I... I just don't see Kevin as the marrying type. Yeah, well, clearly you've never slept with me, honey. No, but really, I have this gut feeling that Kevin picked this weekend and planned it all out to propose to me. Sadie, I... You guys have been together for, what, less than six months? You really think you know him that well? Oh, I knew I wanted to marry Kevin after our first date. He's the one. When you meet the love of your life, you'll just know. I guess. Listen, Sadie, I really like Kevin. I do, but you guys fight an awful lot. I think... your mommy is jealous. I think you have a massive crush on me, you want me to marry you, but unfortunately neither of us are gay. Oh. Jen, you're my best friend. I love you so much. And if... when I get married... I want you to be my maid of honor. When you tell me about the way I smile The way I present my sexy style You're the one that gets me all confused You're the one I love and the one I choose When you tell me about... Baby, I love that you're rich. Aww. I love that you're deep. So you don't love me for my mind? The crazy part, yeah. Well, you're in luck, 'cause I feel like getting crazy this weekend. Well, don't get too crazy there, Sadie. I'll have to lock you up in that prison. Ugh. I hate passing that place. Always creeps me out. I promise to visit you every Sunday. Just for you and me Just for you and me Oh, my first love Little did I know That one can never know Our love Will always be... Baby, I love this place. - We need to stay here till Christmas. - Christmas? Let's just try to make it through the weekend. - You're so funny. - My first love My first love. Kevin, you know I love you, not just for your money. Mostly for your gorgeous hair. Looks like a storm's rolling in. That's going to be so romantic. Oh, God. You're going to get cancer. I don't inhale. Besides, they're not as bad as cigarettes. These never bothered you when we first started going out. You clearly haven't learned that girls put up with a lot of things before they lock you in. I'm your girlfriend now. Things change, you know. I choose to defy you. Does that turn you on? No. But... this does. I have a feeling this is going to be a whiskey weekend. You know what I mean? Capital idea. Mm-hmm. Now, I bet you... want to fuck me right now. Wait. You're right. You're going to have to catch me first. Ow. Come on, old man. This is good for me, 'cause I want to do the Ironman next year... - Come on! - ... and this kind of cardio is exactly what I need. Trying to kill me. Whoo! - All righty. - I win. I guess since you won, you qualify for the victory swim. No! Come and get it! What's this? Kevin, do you love me? Of course I love you. Even though I'm crazy? I love you 'cause you're crazy. I think we should get out. No, no, I don't care. I don't care. If lightning strikes us right now, it'd be God's way of keeping us together for eternity. Let's live a little longer, shall we? You know what you get, don't you? What? What? What are you doing? - You're the winner. - Oh, my God. On the behalf of the community, we'd like to bestow this award upon you. You just came three minutes ago. Well, I'm not Superman. Yes, well, I am your Kryptonite, but I need to go dry our messy, messy clothes. - Okay? - Okay, - Leave me alone for five minutes. - Yeah, all right. Fine. We'll be right out here. Kevin, tell me how much you love me again. Okay, I love you again. I'm serious. You know how much I love you. Do you think we're going to grow old together? Sadie, you having a girl moment right now? Is that what that is? Can you really be happy having sex with just one woman for the rest of your life? As long as that one woman was you, yeah. For the rest of your life? Starting today, the only pussy you'll ever have is mine? As long as you're attached to it. So... you'll never cheat on me? Honey, you're too cute, all right? Now cut it out, would you? Stop being so serious. Come over here and kiss me already. What's a fella got to do? Where are my cigarettes, honey? You give me so much grief for smoking cigars, and you smoke that shit? You know how much I hate that medication you take. We've had this argument. Yeah, I know, and for good reason. Psychs are paid by pharmaceutical companies to prescribe that shit. It's a total scam. I think meds make people more crazy. Some people need it. You've never been manic. You don't understand. If you want me to get off my meds, get me pregnant. I'd stop taking 'em if I was pregnant. I think we'd have to be married first for that. Is that a proposal? I know what you want. I'm going to give you what you really want. - All right. - You're gonna love this, baby. You guys like it - when girls are angry... - Ow. and pissed off when they're giving you head, huh? - Really? Come on now. - Yeah. That's how you like it. - You pervs like it like this. - All right, that's... Ah, God! God! What the fuck?! Ah, my eyes. God damn... get me some water. No. No water. What the fuck happened to my fucking head? You scorned me, Kevin. Oh, baby, I'm... I'm sorry. - You took my heart... - I'm really sorry. and you... you broke my heart. I'm sorry, baby. And you know how much that was going to hurt me. Um... I knew. I'm stupid. I'm really sorry. I was just... You know what? You know what? I love you. I love you. Do you know what I was going to tell you this weekend? What? This weekend, I was going to tell you that we're going to have a baby. I took a pregnancy test last week. I am growing an innocent little baby right here in my tummy. And you know I could never abort a baby. I could never harm an innocent life. - I'm going to be sick. - You know that, right? - That's why I... - All right. I stopped taking my lithium... for you. - For you and the baby. - I didn't know you were pregnant. That's right, 'cause you only cheat on girls who aren't pregnant. That's right. You are such an ethical man. I knew you had character, honey. I knew you had character. - Um... - Go ahead, apologize. Tell me you're sorry. Tell me what a big fucking mistake you made. I'm sorry. That was a big mistake. Yes, it was. But you know what? - I can fix it. - Yeah. I sent Jennifer a text message from your phone. You told her we broke up and I had a friend come and pick me up and you have the house for the rest of the weekend. And she was so excited about that. Oh. Hold on. Hold on. You just got a message. It's from Jennifer. I'll read it to you word for word. "I can leave tonight after work. " Then she wrote an X and an O and an X and an O, etcetera. Those are hugs and kisses. I think she really likes you, honey. I really do. Oh. Another message from Jennifer. - "I can't wait to see you, Kevin. " - Come on. "PS, I'm going 2 B wearing something extra naughty. " Whoo! My goodness. You two are frisky. You promised me a weekend. We're just going to have a friend join us. Remember that time when you asked me if I would be willing to do a threesome? That's the thing about threesomes, of course. You got to do it all together. You can't do it separately. - Fuck! - Ooh. I got to learn how to tie ropes a little better. - You fucking... - Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You know what? You know what? Come here. Come here. You're going to take this whole damn bottle right now. Right now. Okay. Okay. Fuck! Oh, my fucking head. - Oh, my fucking head. - Yeah. I'm about to bash your head in again if you don't calm down. Okay. Oh. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. I really think I should get you a cigar or something. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. Honey, this is going to be so romantic. Ooh. Now, honey, you shouldn't be drinking. Just... it's not good for you. You shouldn't be drinking, smoking. There's a baby in you now. Baby, my mama drank and smoked all through my pregnancy, and I turned out all right. Want some more Vicodin? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Here's one right here for later and one right here for now. Hey, no! Ow. There we go. That's better. Please, you got to stop. You need to stop asking me that. Look at how supportive I'm being. I set up the candles. I got the flower petals here. I swear to God, you men never appreciate anything women do for you. He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. He loves me not. I certainly hope I end on "He loves me"! Me too. "Follow the rose petals. " Hmm. "Follow the rose petals," Bootsie. Go to sleep here, little Bootsie. Mama's got a hot date. Don't mind if I do. "Take your clothes off. " "Come in on your hands n knees"? Shit. Baby? Your naughty little puppy is here. Hello, sexy. Mmm. Take the gag off. Take the gag off. No. Take the gag off of me. Kevin, you're such a freak. Don't use the handcuffs. You don't need to use the handcuffs. Bad dog. You're a cheater, Jennifer, just like Kevin. Sadie, this is crazy. Yeah, it is. We were friends. You were going to be my fricking maid of honor, for Christ's sake. I know. I know, but we can talk about this, right? No. I'm really sorry, Sadie. I know how this must look. Sadie, there's something important you need to know. I'm sure there is, but I don't want to hear anything from you right now. Kevin likes his women clean. Don't you, Kevin? Oh, I prescribed him some medicine. He probably passed out again. Sadie, what are you doing? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Come here. You know what they used to do to cheaters in the medieval days? For one, they used to cut off their hair. - No. No. - You hold still, or I'll pop your fucking eye out. - Please don't. - I have to. Please stop. Sadie. I want to explain everything to you. It should have been you in that hospital, not me. Please. Jen, you look so beautiful. Kevin, she's all ready for you. Isn't she pretty, Kevin? You got to let us go. This is... this is crazy. As crazy as you two loving behind my back? I'm trying to make you feel better. No more guilt, no hiding. I'm going to watch. That way, neither of you are doing anything behind my back anymore. It's all out in the open, no lies, no deceit. Don't you two feel cleaner now? Sadie, we don't want to do this. You don't have a say in this, Jen. Did I have a say when you started loving my boyfriend behind my back? You are a... skanky whore. Look, look, are you okay? I'm... Jennifer... you know I love Bootsie. Oh, my God. You two remember that woman who tried to dry off her poodle in the microwave? She should have read the instructions, but women never do. For Christ's sake, Sadie, this is a little dog. You can't do this. I think 10 minutes should suffice. Just cut the bullshit. You two... you two started the bullshit. Now, what I want you to do is oral her right now, or I will start this microwave, and her little doggy will cook from the inside out. Three... two, one. Okay, okay. We'll do it. Just don't hurt the puppy. Eat her pussy. Do it now. It's okay, Kevin. Just do it. She taste as good as I do? You better answer no. Be nice to have some music right about now. Step a little bit closer, baby Now, do you like what you see? Better not be telling her you love her. You only love me, remember? Look a little bit wiser, baby I see nervousness in your eyes if you want to approach me, baby You need to learn to be smooth and sly Tell me what you really want from me I've heard that pickup line before If you think you've won my goods, baby Then I'll lead you to the fucking door. Sex always makes me hungry. Don't pass out on me, Kevin. Oh, God, now I have to go easier on those drugs I'm giving you. I just love eating outside. I'm so glad it stopped raining. Watery tacos get all mushy and nasty. Here you go, honey. Why don't you have some? Eat it! Well, neither of you told me how good my food is. I'm practically an expert at making tacos. - How many times I made you tacos? - A lot. Mm-hmm. Mmm. I'm pretty sure these are my best. You like 'em, Jennifer? Mm-hmm. Well, speak up, honey. I can't hear you. I said yes. These tacos are good. Okay, Sadie? You goddamn psycho! - Shh. - Can you hear me now?! Your tacos are fucking great, you crazy, fucking bitch. Did you understand that? You need to relax. I'll relax when you stop this shit and let us go. And can I have my fucking clothes back, please? Shh. No, no, no. - What the fuck are you doing, Kevin? - Don't make her angry. What the fuck is wrong with you? - Listen. - Huh? Don't piss her off. It's a fucking game. All right, calm down. Let's just enjoy a nice dinner. Let's get back to the tacos. You know, I use a lot of spices. I make 'em real spicy. If you use a meat that's not the best, covers it up real well. You want some more guacamole on your tacos? No. I'm fine. Here we go. Come here. I love guacamole. Sadie, this is fucked up. Eat it. Right. You know what I was just thinking? I should start a taco stand. That's what I should do. I'd have to think of a real good name for it, something catchy. Bootsie's Taco Stand. By the way, Jennifer, have you seen Bootsie? I haven't seen that little doggy since I started making dinner. Bootsie! Bootsie. Where are you, little doggy? Bootsie. Bootsie, where are you, honey? Oh, there he is. Come here, doggy. There's the little guy. Mwah. Oh. Did you guys spit out your food? I spent an awful lot of time working on this dinner for you guys to spit it out. Aw, now, how could you think I'd cook up little Bootsie here? Huh? I'm not some kind of animal. How fucking long is this going to go on, okay? As long as it needs to. I told you, Kevin, you scorned me. You too, Jen. This little dog, on the other hand, didn't do nothing to me. He's a good puppy. There you go. There you go. Oh. All units be advised, we had an escape from the correctional facility in Logan County. Suspect believed to be dangerous, heading north. Five on the way. Dispatch, we've got no sign of escapee, and we've covered two miles south of 105. Now wake up, Kevin. I want both of you to hear this. Look what I found. All kinds of stuff in this house. Going to tell you guys a story about when I was in the hospital. They thought I was sick. They wanted to cure me. They explained to me that... to change one's behavior, you must change their thinking pattern first. They said that... electricity was good for that. They said it would cure me. I don't know about that. After their shocks, I'd just... get so mad. Mostly I'd just stare out the window, sometimes for hours. If I really misbehaved, they'd take me into this room, and they'd give me shock after shock after shock. There was a certain point, I guess I just stopped misbehaving. I don't know if I was cured, but I certainly didn't feel like doing the things that made 'em give me the shocks. You two have misbehaved. You need to be cured of wanting to fuck each other. All you need is... a little electricity. Oh, shit. I forgot. Could bite your tongue clean off if you don't have protection. Sadie, please let us go. Shh now. Shh! It's all right. Come on, you just... please, you don't need to... - Shh. - Come on. Okay. What's that? Oh, baby, you got a text. It's from your mother. Awful timing. She's asking how we're enjoying our weekend at the house. I will respond for you. "Sadie n I are having an awesome time. By the way, are u still sucking Dad's dick?" I put a little happy face. Oh, Kevin, honey, come on. You never did have a sense of humor. You fucking cunt! You did all this because of a fucking stupid affair? It was nothing! Jesus, Kevin, you're so hostile. I'm just trying to help you. Think of me as your doctor. Oh, honey... you peed your pants. It's okay. It happens. Well, how do you feel, Kevin? Do you feel like sticking your dick into Jennifer anymore? Let us go. Oh, sure, yeah, honey. I'll get right on that. Would you like me to call 911 too while I'm at it? I was in the hospital till I was 18. I think you two are getting off pretty easy. Hasn't this gone on for long enough? What more are you going to do to us? I don't know, Jennifer. I'm a girl. I don't read the instructions. I'm just kind of winging it here. Ugh. What the hell? How do you fucking smoke these things, baby? They taste like shit. Jeez. Who the fuck is that? Help! Help! We're out here by the... You two don't go anywhere. Have a cigar. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Hi there. Is Kevin here? I mean, I saw his car. Yes. Actually, he... is in the shower. Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I live next door. I'm Rita. I'm Sadie. Nice to meet you. - I'm Kevin's girlfriend. - Oh. Actually, his fiancee. It's a secret. Shh. Don't tell anyone. Dear, I don't want to bother you two. I just want to leave some of my chili. It's been Kevin's favorite since he was a kid. - Has it, now? - Yeah. Well, how did you know that chili is my favorite? Kevin! Rita just came over and brought us some chili! Why don't you come in and have some with us? Oh, dear, I've already butted in too much already. No, no, no. Rita, I insist. Bootsie! Bootsie! - Oh. - Bootsie! All units, suspect last seen heading north of 415 toward Hilltop Road. That's a copy, dispatch. We've got units covering the whole county. We've also got the state police assisting. Why do dogs like to find the muddiest puddles? I swear they're just like men. Oh, I don't know what I would have done if Bootsie got away. He's never been to this house. Oh. You run along now. I have a gun in my bedside table. I'm swing to go get it. Meant nothing? Baby... Just shut up and get the gun. I love onions in my chili. Won't you please stay and have some with us? Listen, dear, I still remember what it was like when I was a young girl. You two don't need an old coot like me around. Tell Kevin I said hi. Mm. Looking for this? All right, just... Honey, you told me the gun was in the drawer, remember? Just put the fucking gun down, okay? - This has gone far enough. - No, it hasn't. Just come on! Just stop it! Kevin, get back downstairs. Cumbersome motherfucker. Damn. I'll never see him again. I promise you that, Sadie. I have to teach you to try not to escape. No. For God's sake... Don't you know there is no God? Or else why would he let me do this to you? No, please. - Hey! - Don't. - Hey! - No. No. - Please! - Don't fight it, cheater. I have to punish you so that you learn not to loosen your fingers like Kevin did. Come on, Sadie, look at me. It's me, Jen, your best friend since second grade. I've learned my lesson, I swear to God. I told you. There is no God. That's why I have to do this to you. You've lost your mind. I don't see you in you anymore. I don't know you. You know, you're right, Jen. Yeah, we're friends. We were friends! Ah, no. How can you fucking do that to her? Did you want to say something? How can you do that to her? Well, she's passed out now. She doesn't feel anything. You seem awfully protective of her. I'm going to fucking kill you. That's no way to talk to the mother of your child. No, I'm going to see to it that you don't run away again. Do you remember our favorite movie, baby? You got it on DVD. Oh, we saw a lot of movies, Sadie. Oh, I think it'll come to you. Kathy Bates was very good in it. "Misery. " What's the scene that everybody remembers? No. You... you can't do that. - It just creeped everybody out. - No. I think they called it hobbling. No. Okay. You can't do this. What I can't do is have my man try to run away from me again. That's what I can't do. - No. - I'm sorry, honey. This is... this is going to hurt. You're not going to... I'm sorry. Fuck! - Jesus, fuck. - Oh! I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry, Kevin. I don't think I could break the other one. How the hell did she break both of them in the movie? I feel like I'm going to be sick. Hey. Been asleep for almost an hour. Where is Kevin? He's upstairs. I felt really, really bad after I crushed his ankle. I wrapped it and gave him some Vicodin. He's totally knocked out. Will you please let me go? No. You should take some of these. I don't want to. The pain in my hand is just numb now. Not for your hand. Trust me. You're going to want 'em. Here. Here. Drink, drink, drink. When does this finish? When I'm finished. Did I... ever tell you the story about when my sister took my little puppy's love away from me? What are you talking about? I had just turned 11. My dad bought me the cutest little puppy. My little sister played with it... and pet it... until that little puppy started to love her more than it loved me. Maybe it didn't love her more. Maybe you just thought that. That's not true. One night, I went in her room, and that little puppy was sleeping, curled up on her bed. I told you I killed that puppy. - That's why you went to the hospital. - No. I didn't kill the puppy. You didn't? No. See, I couldn't blame my little puppy. It wasn't his fault. He didn't know no better. It was my sister's fault. So the next day, she had a little accident in the pool. I helped her drown. You told me you tried to save her. I told everyone that. It wasn't true, Jen. What I didn't tell you is that the police didn't believe me. I was too young to go to jail, so, you know, they could only keep me till I was 18. Listen, I've been thinking... Kevin is a lot like my little puppy was. I can't really blame him, you know? You and me, we always said that men are like dogs. Someone just smiles at 'em, they'll jump up and sleep in their bed. You... are beautiful, Jennifer. You have the most beautiful smile. Maybe if my sister... wasn't so pretty, my little puppy would have stayed with me. You're beautiful, Sadie. Not as pretty a smile as Jennifer. That's not true. When we're at bars, guys always want your number first. Let's not beat around the bush. Your dad's a dentist. Your teeth are perfect. I'm just going to chip one of 'em. What? Yeah. It'll work better if you hold still. Hey! Hold still. It'll go easier. Just stop struggling. I'm not going to pull out your tooth. I'm just going to chip it. You do have nice teeth. Sorry, I must have nicked your gums. I guess you're kind of pissed, aren't you? Green tea's ready. Just don't forget the lemon! Two sugars, right? Oh! Bootsie. Oh, honey. Have you not had dinner yet? I'm so sorry. Here, have some chili. Oh, and, Kevin, you're going to love the little polka-dotted dress I got for you. Didn't have any lemon, so I had to use... lemon juice. Kevin, you look so pathetic. There, silly Willy. All yours. Kevin, you're never getting out of here. You're all mine. Hmm. Do you like my dress? You think it's pretty on me? I brought it up here to surprise you this weekend. Now I want you to take a good look. Get this picture of my sexy panties in your mind. What are you going to do with that? Baby, I've been doing a lot of thinking. It wasn't your fault. You know, you cheating on me with Jennifer. She was cute and sexy. And once you laid your eyes on her, it was impossible for you to resist. But I have a way to make that never happen for us again. You have wandering eyes, Kevin, and that's not good for our relationship, baby. Haven't you done enough? All right? Come on. I learned my lesson. Just please don't. I gave you the image of the sexy underwear. Don't take my eyes. Now I'm just going to take your wandering eyes away. - No, please. - Just be quiet now. - Shh. - Not my eyes. Just please don't take... please. Don't, don't. Don't, please. Don't take my fucking eyes! Not my eyes. Come on. Come on. - No! - Jeez, baby. I wasn't trying to kill you, just trying to blind you. Fucking bitch, no! Dispatch, this is unit 26. Motorist possibly spotted suspect heading north of Sherwood. Better, you big baby? You're a fucking animal. I can barely see. That's the idea, silly. All right. Here is some Vicodin... for your pain. Here's hot tea. Careful. It's still a little warm. Careful, baby. Don't burn your lips. I think you've learned your lesson. I'm going to go check on Jen. You still here? Please... help me. I came down here to inform you that apparently Kevin doesn't miss you anymore at all. That's okay. I just want to go home. Oh, that's not for you. There's a boat down at the lake. Got to fill it with gas. We're going boating. I know you don't like the water. Quite frankly, I've had some lousy luck with it myself. But I hear drowning is a painless way to go. At least I hope so. My poor little sister. If you let me go now, I won't tell anyone, like this never happened. Let you go? Come on, Jennifer. You think I'm crazy? Yeah. You know what? You are crazy. You're a fucking psycho bitch! What more could you do to me, Sadie? Kill me? That's what you plan on doing, right? We're friends. I thought I knew you. Nobody knew you, Sadie. I slept with Kevin. Get over it. It's not the end of the fucking world, okay?! You're a drama queen. Sit down, drama queen. Jesus. Come on, baby. Come on, fucker. Hey. Help! Help! Jennifer, get in the car or I'll blow your tits off. Does love die... I never meant for any of this to happen. Yeah, well, it sure did, didn't it? - Or will two hearts... - Oh. - It's Kevin and my song. - Be there forever? - Ironic. - Can stolen love... I just never thought Kevin was right for you. I don't know that I'm right for anyone. Maybe that's not true. Maybe there is one person. Yeah? Who would that be? Me. A hurt so deep - I tried to tell you. - Will always be... I've always seen your magic, Sadie. Haven't I always been there when you needed me? What if I told you I loved you? Everything I did I did to get closer to you. That'd be a real fucking complication, wouldn't it be? I don't want to die, Sadie. Part of me doesn't want that either. Can stolen love live... Sadie. To be returned? No. Does love die then - Or do we want to know? - Sadie. Does love die? Does love die? Shit! Does love die? Fucking song wasn't even over. You don't really listen, do you? You know what, Sadie? Go ahead and kill me already. That's your plan, isn't it... you flat-chested whore? You know why I was your only friend? Nobody liked you. Everyone thought you were a freak. Everyone thought you were nuts. The guys knew you'd put out, so they went out with you. That's all you were good for, Sadie, good for an easy lay. You said you loved me, Jennifer. Or were you just lying when you said that? Fuck... you. Luau am rescinding my request for you to be my maid of honor! Die! What the fuck? You're a tough fuck to kill. I'll be right back. What's going on? Where were you guys 10 minutes ago when I was changing my tire? Can you check my tire and make sure it's okay? Sure. Looks good. Where you headed? Oh, just went to get some cigarettes, head back to the house and my boyfriend. Shady habit. The cigarettes, not my boyfriend. There was an escape just a few miles from here. We have extra squads out. We'll find this guy. Once you get home, make sure you lock your doors. If you see anybody or anything that looks out of place, you call 911, okay? Thank you, Officer, both of you. Thanks for the warning. Help. What the hell? Hel... hel... Help. What the... There really is a God after all. Jeez. Need a lift? I sure do. Buckle up. Didn't think anybody'd stop for me on a night like this. Guess it's your lucky day. Car break down? Uh, yeah, couple miles back there. How far you going? Wherever you're heading, I guess. I ran into some cops back there. They said a man escaped from prison not far from here. I didn't know they had a prison around here. I bet men in prison don't... get a lot of pussy. Guess not. Bet it's been a while for you, too. Don't try to figure this out. I'm just a crazy, horny bitch. Really, really horny. Oh, God. Oh. Come on. I want you to come. I want you to come. Oh, baby. That was great. Uh-huh. Yeah, it was. I want to thank you. Oh, baby, you just did thank me. No... I want to thank you for my alibi. You get me all messy. Okay. Buckle up. Okay. Kevin! Honey, I'm back! Shit. Kevin. Baby, where are you? Show your face. Damn. Damn it. Fuck. Oh! Hey! Eh! No! No! Oh, Kevin. I forgive you now. I really do. He tried to drive away after killing my friends and raping me. Bang. And you crushed my hand in the vise. Ah, shit. This is going to hurt. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck, that really hurt. Fuck. 911. What is your emergency? This man came to the house. He killed my boyfriend. He raped me. I'm sending help. I'm notifying the paramedics. Please, you got to send someone. Help is on the way. Ls the man still there? Oh, uh, yes. - Yes, he is. - Where is the man now? He's dead. Uh... I managed to find a revolver in the house and... and shoot him. Okay. Just stay calm. I'm hurt really badly. Please send... please send someone. Just stay with me, honey. I've got the paramedics and police on the way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Fuck. I have to ask you a few questions, sweetheart. It's very important. Are you allergic to any medicines? Okay, because of your injuries, I have to ask you. Are you pregnant? No, I'm not pregnant. Okay, we're going to get you to the hospital as quick as we can. - Doctors are waiting. - Thank you. Found this dog. Poor thing was hiding in the back room. Bootsie! There you are, sweetie. I'm so glad that man didn't hurt you. Oh. Oh, you must still be scared. That's okay, baby. Mama's here. Mama's here. I love you. We'll take the dog. We'll take good care of her. Thank you. Thank you so much. And, Sheriff... I just wanted to ask you a question. Was he the man who escaped from prison? Yeah, we think it was. You were very brave to do what you did. You saved your life. Yeah, I just wish I could have saved my boyfriend. You made it. You'll be okay now. Yeah. I think I will. I'll never get it. Longer I'm on the job, the more it baffles me. I just hope that poor girl... she can get through all this. - Hi, gorgeous. - Hi, honey. Oh, and you, too, Bootsie. Can I get you anything? I'll have an iced tea, please. Nice ass. Sadie, you're the most beautiful girl in the world. The whole wide world and parts of the universe, too? Most parts. I love you, Sadie. You do? So you'd never cheat on me? A guy would have to be crazy to even look at another woman when he's got a girl as great as you. I suppose you're right. Besides, if you cheated on me, I'd have to kill you. Hey, why are the cute ones always taken? Not always. All I know is he's for me Going to be the girl And he's going to be the boy That puts her in a whirl Some say she's crazy Some say she's not so bad I say she's maybe Everything he needs All I know is he's the one Love is always strong But it isn't always love That's the name of the song Some say she's crazy Some say she's not so bad I say she's maybe Everything he needs All I know is he's the one He's the one He's the one He's the one He's the one He's the one. Step a little bit closer, baby Now, do you like what you see? If you're going to be playing these games Then you're never going to get with me Look a little bit wiser, baby I see nervousness in your eyes if you want to approach me, baby You need to learn to be smooth and sly Tell me what you really want from me I've heard that pickup line before If you think you've won my goods, baby Then I'll lead you to the fucking door Tell me what you want to do with me I am far from that type Just because I wear the clothes real tight It doesn't mean you're going to get the goods tonight Breathe a tiny bit slower, baby I feel desperation taking over you if only you could feel me out Would you understand my point of view Take the time to know my name 'Cause you're not going to win this game I like to take it nice and slow So get out of the fast lane Tell me what you really want from me I've heard that pickup line before If you think you've won my goods, baby Then I'll lead you to the fucking door Tell me what you want to do with me I am far from that type Just because I wear the clothes real tight It doesn't mean you're going to get the goods tonight So I'll say it again Tell me what you really want from me I've heard that pickup line before If you think you've won my goods, baby Then I'll lead you to the fucking door Tell me what you want to do with me I am far from that type Just because I wear the clothes real tight It doesn't mean you're going to get the goods tonight.
