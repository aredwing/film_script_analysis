(Shout) Yeah! Pity the fate of young fellows Too long a bed with no sleep With their complex romantic attachments Oh, look on their sorrows and weep They don't get a moment's reflection There's always a cloud in their eye Pity the plight of young fellows Regard all their worries and cry Their Christian mothers were lazy perhaps Leaving it up to the school Where the moral perspective Is hazy perhaps And the climate oppressively cool Give me one acre of cellos Pitched at some distant regret Pity the fate of young fellows And their anxious attempts to forget These are the tears of a thug Like murky water Crying tears as clear as mud For his father's daughter His half-sister He felt obliged to support her Since her mum was poor And her dad died even poorer Separated until she was eight years old He knew as soon as he saw her That he adored her Now he's payin' for her blood with a borer And an automatic weapon Smith & Wesson Split a fucking hole in your chest He's looking to corner the perpetrators Responsible for her killing He's gonna murder every single fuckin' one of them, God willing It's eating him inside Although you wouldn't be able to tell By just looking in his eyes Cos his tears cry inwards Years of hiding his true feelings From the streets Have left him incapable of showing Any other emotion than anger So when Jody takes him To Fat Mick's motors where Terry works He don't ask questions first Just straight bangs up Mans with the butt of the gun Turns it on Terry before he can run And demanding answers He knows Terry didn't kill Kirby But he thinks he may have set him up J' Why else would he have taken The drugs afterwards? Terry tries to explain They were already dead when he got there And the other girl, he can't remember Her name but she was not there Not there when he came back Was before he went out Chris stops him there Arms stretched with the leng out He says, "I know about the other girl How the fuck do you think I found you? "And I know you're fuckin' lying So say your prayers now" You fucked with the wrong gangster And now you've gotta pay J' That's when the blood-stained crackhead He gun-butted on the way to Fat Mick's Taps him on the shoulder With a bust nose and fat lip And says he knows Who might have done it... I was geftin' a rock off Marcel and I see Kirby behind the alley. Behind the barbershop in the alley. - What time? - About midday. He pulled out a gun. He pulled out a gun! I shit myself and I run! - You're lying! - I'm not. I swear to God I'm not. I'm not. I swear to God. Get the fuck down! Fucking hell. - Fucking Marcel! - Chris, it couldn't have been Marcel. How the fuck do you know if it was Marcel or not? I met Marcel. I know him. - He's done my fucking nose, mate. - Oh, fuckin' hell! Come on. Let's go. They guy who done it, he was small. He was a kid. Fuck that! If he wasn't Marcel... He's fucking involved! I'm not saying that. But he couldn't have been the guy who pulled the trigger. The guy who done it, man, he was a kid. He was small. - Couldn't have been much older than me. - I'm gonna take you home. '(Gunfire) 'Motion sickness. Cases have been popping up all over since...' - Want anything from the shop? - Nah, I'm good. What the fuck! - Who the fuck killed Kirby? - I don't know who done it! Tell me or I'm gonna blow your head off! - It was Jake! - Who the fuck's Jake? Some yoot, bruv. Some hyped yoot. - Why the fuck did he kill Kirby? - Kirby must have boy'd him off, man. So why was you running down the road naked the other day? I must have banged some yet and her man come home. I had to duck.

(Plan B) This story's dark Like the place where this story starts Full of fiends and gangsters With gory hearts Drugged-up girls Dressed up like naughty tarts Performing sex And perverted forms of art On anybody with a fantasy That needs fulfilling Even the filth, cops that lock up man For stealin' frequent there Bent sweat drippin' off the ceiling Sadomasochists that need To quench their thirst for beatings Anything goes when you've got the riches but only the sexually depraved Pay for pregnant bitches Her name's Katya Yours to do what you wish with If you're into chicks that wake up With morning sickness And have to make their way Past people fuckin' Punters hooked on hookers Hooked on smack cluckin' Spent her days getting touched up And fucked, fuckin' Wishing she could wake up From the nightmare she was stuck in But she weren't wakin' up from nothin' This was her reality A place where dreams come true For those who lack morality She had to get out Not for her child, for her sanity Cos the only difference Between this place and hell was gravity Yeah It was a weird twist of fate The way that she escaped She knew her chance would come She just had to wait Till one of her abductors Made a mistake Mixing vodka with heart pills And smoking a straight With the door unlocked Ain't the smartest idea When your runnings are illegal And your cargo live in fear Her path was now clear But only for her exit Cos although ahead was long And full of unexpected twists and turns She learned inadvertently how to cope With life's little moments of uncertainty Feelin' safe on the street However absurd it seems The mother and baby unit Where she had disturbing dreams Was the place she didn't feel was safe And had to leave It would only be a matter of time before she had police asking her questions J' Finding out the truth About her underworld connections Sending her back to the brothel Either that or simply just deporting her She's met corrupted law before She can't see them supporting her So she goes along a road That slowly starts destroying her Not knowing where she's going Or why God just keeps ignoring her (Baby cries) (Spits) How much? Fuckin' 50? (scoffs) Fuckin' brassin' with a baby? Here you are. 40 notes. Why don't you buy the little fucker a dummy or something? Shut it up! Fuckin' disgusting! Who the fuck are you?

Oi, listen, I'll explain, yeah? Basically, a bit of a... Ed should never have sold you the baby. I didn't want to, but when I came down here, I didn't know this was gonna happen. I spent the whole day looking for the mum and that's her. And she wants the baby back. She was turning tricks with some heavy fucking Russians who got her banged up. She thought they were gonna kill the baby. So she fucking left it on the train. (snores) Now here's the money and I'll give you the rest of it when I get in touch with Ed. Now you've got to give the baby back cos she ain't yours. - She ain't havin' the baby back. I'm sorry. - Yes, she is. You know what? That is fucking brilliant, pal! A bit elaborate. You know what I mean? You came in here three hours ago. I give you eight fucking bags for a baby and now you want the baby back with half the money? What a fucking prize cunt or what? Look at her. Done up very well. Yeah, looks good, innit? Russian gangsters, babies on trains and where the fuck's Ed? You walk in with Ed. Am I gonna get four grand back off Ed? - I don't think so, do you? - Yeah. - You do, do ya? - That's half of it there. A load of bollocks, pal. You can shove it right up your arse. No chance! - It's not your baby. - What are you talking about? Don't worry. It's a scam. Can't you see it? It's not a fuckin' scam, Vince, and you know it! - It's her baby! She's the mother! - Shut your mouth! Can't understand it without a cock in your mouth, can ya? It's all right when it's your fuckin' cock in my mouth! Hold on a minute. What did she just say then? She's a brass. She's always got a cock in her mouth. What did you think I said? No, she said your cock in her mouth. Do I look like I'm fuckin' lying? And if I am fuckin' lying, go get the baby. And give it to them, cos that's what they fuckin' want! - I ain't giving them the fucking baby back! - Well, they ain't getting it either! You stupid bitch! Oi! Oi! Come here! Fucking... Oi! Fuck off! Fucking slag! Settle the fuck down, all right? Right, now you, get the fuck upstairs and get the baby! (Baby cries) Come on. It's all right. It's all right. (Coughs) Oi!

The gun! Aaron! (Siren blares) Who else knows about this? No one. What do you mean no one? What about Ed? He's dead. What the fuck do you mean Ed's dead? How did he die? Don't worry how he fucking died, bruv. Just know that he died... getting you this. Bruv, where the fuck are you going, man? Shut the door. Come work for me then, innit? I'll bell you tomorrow. (Kisses teeth) (Sighs) (sobs) (Mobile rings) Take this, innit, for the funeral. They might not let you cos you ain't family. Tell them you're his sister or something. Yeah, course. Oi! What flowers do you reckon he'd have liked? In the hearse and that? Don't know. Anything that you choose. White roses are nice, innit? Yeah. Where's he goin' then?
