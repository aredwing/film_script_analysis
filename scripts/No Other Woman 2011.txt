So discreet that the person won't notice that you're tempting. Pretend you're not interested. But you're relentless in your pursuit. Don't let go. And when that moment comes, act fast. But never ever look desperate. Remember this is your game. Show who's in control. Because once you see through that person's weakness... that's your signal to strike. So steep. 80,000 pesos for a sexy chair? Agree it's a bit pricey. But looking at you... you only look like you deserve the best. You said it yourself, ma'am. It's a sexy chair, just like a sexy woman like you. And once you finally get her, I tell you. She will do everything you'd want her to do. And that's the secret to being a good salesman. It's all about temptation. Nothing different when you pick up a girl. So that's why you're a quick seller! You use your being a womanizer to your advantage. I'm not a womanizer. At least not anymore. You? Are you saying that since you and Charmaine were together... you never cheated? Never. I promise you, man. When you get married, it's totally different. You'll understand one day. Really now? - Hi. Ram Escaler. - Ito dela Cruz. It's nice to meet you. Anything I can do for you, sir? Oh, you can do a lot of things for me, but for now I just want to look around. Okay, what exactly are you looking for? We have everything here. Everything? All the furniture that you see here... have been featured in international magazines. We have pieces from Italy, Spain, avant-garde German, Swiss. But most of our furniture here are... from up and coming local talent... because we'd like to believe in our very own, of course. So what is it for? Is it for the bedroom? Study? Living room? Actually, for an entire resort. Here they are. - Hello Sir. - Hi! Mr. Zalderiaga, I would like you to meet Ram Escaler. - He's going to bid for our furniture. - Oh. - Good luck. - Ram. Sir. - Hi, how are you? - I'm good. Thank you. How are you related to Jaime? He's my father, sir. You' re Jaime's son? How is he doing nowadays? To tell you the truth sir, we don't see each other anymore. - Busy, I suppose? - Maybe. So how do you know my father? I know him very well. Your dad used to be my business partner. We used to be very good friends, until he cheated me in our business. I'm sorry to hear that sir, but that's my father. But I assure you, I'm nothing like him. I would hope so. Well, feel free to check out the resort and... - enjoy the facilities. Be my guest. - Thank you very much! Okay. Good afternoon! You see that watchtower out there? It's a very beautiful resort. The waters are clear, the sands white. The hotel is quite spacious. From what I gathered, during the peak season... it costs 50,000 pesos per night per person. Why don't you invite me and your dad-in-law? Who in his right mind would waste They're all the same. Dad, don't be too negative. As for me love, I'm excited with your project. I hope you seal the deal. I'm going back there next week for another inspection. I'll see if I can bring you with me. Sure. Why do you have to keep going back there Ram? How many times do you have to keep going back there... to know how many chairs and tables you're going to supply? Enough with the speech. Let's just enjoy our dinner, okay? Don't mind him. Just get used to him. How can I not mind him, hon? This house is his wedding gift. But I never felt that this is ours. Everything comes from your dad. Sometimes, I feel like I'm being emasculated. The problem with your dad is until now, he has no trust in me. He's never going to like me. Enough, love. Are we going to be like this every night? Sorry babe. Promise, I won't mention it again, okay? Okay. Let me make it up to you. Hey, you okay? I can't find my bikini top. Here you go. I hope you don't mind. Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. - Hello. - Yes Jake? Grandpa got into a stroke again. He wants you to visit him. What? - Where's your dad? - He's out. Gramps, when are we playing golf again? You should see me play now. I score single digit now. Next time, I'd be able to give you a plus. I'm dying- I hope you patch things up with your dad. What's this? That's for grandpa. - I don't need this. - I know you don't. But that's not for you. That's for grandpa. What do you want to prove? That you're rich? That you're big shot now? I'm not a big shot, dad! I just want to show you that I'm not like you! I'm not going to abandon my family. Of course I'm just going to wear something simple. I don't want to outshine my mother-in-law. It's their 50th wedding anniversary. Congressman Chavez will be there. They have to be seated up front. That's why they keep saying we're nouveau riche. - Nouveau, nouveau! - Ouch! What's wrong with being surrounded with gold and imported things? Nouveau! They're just envious! Hand me those shoes. - They're golden. - Dad... how are we going to reach our 50th anniversary... like grandpa and grandma... if you're like that with Ram? He's doing his best. Dad, please. Enough with Ram. Thank you, Dad. Good morning. I'm here to meet Mr. Zalderiaga. - May I have your ID, sir? - Yes, sure. Yes? - I have a meeting with Mr. Zalderiaga. - Let me check him in his office. - Please have a seat, sir. - Thank you. Good morning, ma'am. Hi. Hi. You're that guy in Costa Luz. - Do you work here? - No. I'm here to meet Mr. Zalderiaga. I have a furniture business and... I'm hoping that we will supply the furniture for your new resort. So fingers crossed. Good luck. Piece of advice, if you want to impress my dad, just be yourself. So you're the- Well, I'll see you inside then. Yeah, I'll see you in there. As you can see... nothing is compromised in the process of creating our furniture. From the conception of the design to the actual construction. As with price, yes we are a bit more expensive than others but... sir, with the vision of your company... in making Costa Luz a Class A luxury resort... I think our furniture will definitely suit your clientele. You think the people will actually go to our luxury resort... because of your very expensive furniture? Mr. Escaler, people don't go on vacation to witness an art exhibit. - Yes, I understand that. - Well then... what's their reason for going to our resort? To swim? Obviously, it's a beach resort. Of course, they're going to swim. But the real question is, why not another resort? A cheaper resort. We're very expensive. Yes, we're expensive, Ms. Kara. But as per our research report, which I'm sure you've read... our customers will pay as long as we offer them the complete experience. Precisely. And we should give them exactly that. The luxurious furniture will add to the luxurious ambiance of our luxury resort. And actually, one more thing... I don't need to read your research report. I know the market, because I am the market. That would be all for now Mr. Escaler. We will get back to you on this. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Ram. Kara, what should I say, thank you. Thank you for defending me in there. - Is there anything I can do- - No... - forget it. - Please. But if you do want to join me for lunch, you can return the favor. - Actually I have- - Let's go. My dad must really like you. He doesn't normally meet all his suppliers. In fact, I myself, am having a hard time... to even set an appointment with my own father. But you know what... I really feel that you have a good chance of getting this project. I hope I'll just keep my fingers crossed. I really should be heading back to the office. - So yeah. - Okay. - Here, let me- - No, this is my treat. - Are you sure? - Yes. I got this. Bye. It was nice meeting you. Likewise. Bye. Bye. - Ma, let's go! Hurry! - Hello, Ram. Where are you? I've been calling you. Sorry babe, I'm still stuck in the middle of a long meeting. Long meeting? Well hurry up. They're all pressuring me here. We'll go ahead. Hi hon. Hon, I'm sorry. I know I'm late but I got stuck in a meeting. Love, please wear this. Hon, you know I don't wear this when I'm with my clients. Please don't get mad. Sister, Mom wants to see you. Wait. - Mom, what happened? - Look at your father! Don't he come here or I'll kick his balls! Mom! Calm down. For all you know, that's not her mistress. She might be his business partner. Business partner? Look! I'm going to give that girl a bitch slap! I know those kinds of women. And I know that she's been crazy about your dad for a while now! If she's a python, then I'm a cobra! I'm just quiet... - but when pissed, I bite! - Ma, watch your words. Watch your words, you both listen to me! Especially you, Cha. A lot of women are salivating over your husband. But when another woman comes to the picture... give that bitch a good fight! Basically, this building is going to be the wellness center. - It's facing the South China Sea. - Okay. Those areas should have corresponding furniture. Hopefully, they can make the ambiance more conducive. - Hello architect. - Hello. - Hi. - Hello Mr. Escaler, are you guys done? I was just actually showing him the building. Great! Well Mr. Escaler, I think it's time that you see... and experience Costa Luz. Aren't we going to the lighthouse? No. I'm sure she knows best. It's okay, I can take care of you. I can take him there, and also give you a tour as well. - Aren't you gonna join us? - No. - I got him, cuz. Let's go. - Yup. All right. You guys take care. Enjoy. Bye, cousin. Bye. Kara, I'm married. Just my luck. I'm sorry. Well, no consequences. No pressure then. I'm not gonna be your mistress, Ram. A woman only becomes a mistress when there's emotional involvement. And I have no plans of falling in love with you. - So are you saying it's okay- - Just shut up... and kiss me and don't you dare fall in love with me. Good morning. Good morning. - Do you want to see? - Sure! I'm sketching some designs that your dad wants me to do. Here, me. Well, maybe we could remove this. Let's keep it simple. Not too much... just keep it classy. - I love seafood. - Looks like you're enjoying it. Why are you using the utensils? Why don't you get your hands dirty? I can't. The wifey doesn't permit me to use my hands at home so... That's the whole point. How can you enjoy this kind of food... if you're not going to eat it with bare hands. Fine. Happy? Look at me. I'm not allowed to eat this, but I'm enjoying. Why aren't you allowed? I'm allergic. You know- I'm not afraid of an allergy attack. And if I'd just accept this... how am I going to know that it tastes good? You should fight it, even if it's forbidden. Because eventually, your body will get used to it, anyway. Are you okay? Here. - You want tea? I made you some tea. - Okay. Did it help? You know what, I'm okay. You can go. I can take care of myself. I'm sure you can but, I wanna help you. I wanna take care of you. Next time, when it's forbidden, it's forbidden. - You're home. - You're still awake. Are you hungry? I cooked your favorite. Excuse me, let me just heat your food. I hope you're feeling better by the time you read this. See you in Manila. I miss you already. Ram So even if you're married, that's fine with Kara? Yes, the deal is clear. No strings attached. I thought you're a faithful husband. I tried. Word of caution, my friend... you might not know where you're headed. Everything in this world seems good at the beginning. But all I'm saying is you should both know when to stop. Okay? I will give my life savings for one night with Marco. No, it's not worth it. I thought he was boy number five? Imagine, Kara went out with that guy! I know right? Who wouldn't lose his mind with your modus operandi? You're gonna make a guy fall for you, then when he's deeply in love, goodbye! You're very mean, girl. It's not my fault that they can't follow my rules. Rules?! That concludes my presentation. I hope you guys liked it. Costa Luz is very lucky to have you, Ram. Very nice. Thank you for the hard work. Thank you sir, but actually your daughter- she came up with the whole idea. And actually, the design is hers. I just did the execution. At least she learned something in New York. I'd like to see the budget next. There you go. To my dad. So tell me, why can't you get along with your dad? He just didn't like the person I became after New York. He felt like I became too liberated. And he just couldn't accept the fact... that I don't want to work with the company anymore. Why don't you want to work for his company? It's a good company. I'm so sick of living in his shadow. Can I not achieve anything? I didn't study abroad for nothing. He just became awkward after that and... my dad didn't trust any of my opinions on the company. You know what, Kara? You should consider yourself lucky. Your dad still supports you. Me, my dad doesn't care about me. I was still in college when he abandoned us. We became so poor. My mom took over... all the support for the family and... she ended up having a brain tumor and passed away. I'm sorry to hear that. No, it's okay. The past is the past but... the funny thing is... my father-in-law doesn't believe in me. The sad thing is... Moving on... Sorry. - Depressing. So, what do you think about my place, Mr. Designer? Mr. Designer, are you sure you want me to answer that? Yes. No seriously, if this were my place, I'd set it up just like this. - Really? - Really! Except one minor thing. What? What were you thinking when you purchased that? I love that bed. It's boring, and small. Boring? Well, the reason why I like that bed and I don't want a big one... When you see an empty space, it makes you realize that you're alone. And I don't like that. And what if someone wants to fill in that empty space? The woman from the province is now stepping up. Of course. From wet market to Sunday market. I don't wanna be smelling like fish. Dad is asking us to set aside some cupcakes for Mayor. He said he gave him a new project. He's only giving them to his mistress. Who has a mistress? Your dad has already said sorry. You're sweating. - Where did you come from? - It's just hot outside. - Babe, what's that? This one? - Nothing. - Just got it from the beach. Costa Luz. - May I see? Jellyfish. Oh those nasty, itchy jellyfish! - When they bite, they leave a mark. - That's true! - Hi! - Good morning. Hello, Ma'am. Hi! Where's Ram? Oh he's not here, ma'am. - Oh. - Sir? - Cha? Hey! Hi. - Hi. - Hi! - Are you going to see Ram today? Supposedly. But I don't know why he's still not here. Okay. You inspired me to make this. Surprise. - Take care, bye. - Sister. Didith, have you followed up the... Good afternoon. How may I help you? - Hello. - Yes, ma'am. I'd like to confirm... our dinner reservation with Mr. Ram Escaler tonight? Okay, please hold. Thank you. - I just got used to my old bed. - No, I understand. It's really hard when you're used to something. Even for me, a bed is very personal. Because when you're tired... you rest together, you sleep together... you have dreams together. And like you said, you've been through a lot. But Kara, it's- It's always good to try something new. It's a pleasure talking to you ma'am. Thank you so much. Yes, good evening ma'am, welcome to The Lounge. Good evening. Mr. Ram Escaler's table, please. - And you are? - I'm his wife. Can I use your powder room? There's a shorter way here, ma'am. Thank you. Excuse me. I'm on my way to the table. Don't worry, I'll see you. Thank you. Ram- Ram, it's nice to see you here. Are you alone? Oh, you're out on a date. Good for you. Celebrating anything special? I'd like to introduce you to my wife. - Babe, this is Mr. Seville. - Hello... - you are... - Hello. I'm Charmaine. Charmaine. Love, I'm sorry. You're not answering my calls so I decided to come here. Are you mad? Sorry. No. Ram, aren't you going to introduce me to her? Cha, this is Kara Zalderiaga, my boss's daughter. Kara, this is my wife, Charmaine. Your wife. Nice to finally meet you. Pleased to meet you. - This is my friend, Andrew. - Hi, Andrew. Good to meet you. Hello. - Hi. - Hi. Anyway, we need to go ahead. Let's go. Let's go. Kara, a married man? You?! I have no intentions of ruining their marriage. Come on. I'm old enough to take care of myself. I know what I'm doing. This isn't even an affair. We're just two consenting adults, having fun. There's no emotional attachment. Having fun? Now, yes, fun. But what if he leaves you? What if he chooses his wife over you? What if your family gets scandalized? Is it still fun? Don't say we didn't warn you, Kara... when Daphne and I start visiting you in some rehab for fallen mistresses. I'm not a mistress. I never was and I never will be one. I'm not a mistress. Can't sleep. I already miss you. Can't talk. She's beside me, call me. Just wanna hear your voice. Hello. I just wanted to say that you really have good taste in women. Your wife is really pretty. Well, I'm not used to talking to myself. I'll see you tomorrow at work. I can't wait... I told you to stop crying! Don't waste your energy. Know who you're up against. Remember, if a guy has a lot of other women, that's okay. That's not a problem. At least, he still comes home to you. But if a guy sticks to one woman and makes her his favorite... that's when you should fight. But this is not my thing! Why do I have to fight for someone who's mine?! Because the world is a huge Quiapo! There are a lot of snatchers! You'll get robbed! So fight! Look at yourself. It's time to pack up that Lucy Torres image. You should bring out Gretchen Barretto! Like what she said in Rivals. You want war, I'll give you war! I'll take care of your red stilettos! But my rival is not just anybody. She's an heiress. Who's easier to beat a penniless slut or a wealthy slut? They're both sluts! The wealthy one has an original Hermes bag. The poor slut has one from the flea market. That's it! Babe? Babe... Babe... Babe... Babe... Not in the mood? I'm just... I'm just really tired, okay? Babe... What's wrong? Is there somebody else? No. Nobody. Nobody. Is it Kara? Kara? Babe, it's just you. You're the only one I love. Nobody else. It's just you, okay? I'm just gonna take a quick shower and I'll be right back, okay? Babe, please take out the candles. It's getting hot. I love you. If Cha is starting to doubt you, then stop it. You might end up just like the YouTube video I saw. What video? It's one of a kind! The wife attacked her husband's mistress in the mall. She was bleeding. It's like watching UFO. So dude, you need to be careful. Wives are different now. They don't just sit in one corner and keep quiet. If they need to kill their husband's mistress, they'd do it. So now that it's confirmed that your husband has a mistress... why don't you ask him straight? I already did that. The prick denied it. Oh yeah, men will never come clean. If I were you, I'd tell him all I know. I'll make him choose the mistress or me. I don't need to do that. You're just afraid that he might choose the mistress. Wait, is there a Barney party that I didn't know about? Go. Leave now. Don't you make a scandal here. I don't want to be in tomorrows tabloids. Too bad, I also like this. Hi, do you remember me? Of course. Are you getting this? Because if not, I'll buy it. I'll get it, sorry. That's okay. Because I play fair. If it's already owned by someone else, you have no right to take it away. Of course. But you know, there are other options. Like this bag. You can be sure that I won't take that away from you. Ma'am, don't worry. We have another stock inside. What a coincidence! I hope that the color is the only thing we share. We both know that there's another thing that we have in common. The bag. Coffee? You like nice things? Yes I do. They're my guilty pleasures. But I don't actually feel guilty. Because I know I deserve it. I bet it feels good to be an heiress? You can have anything. You can buy anything. As for me, I believe that the best things in life are free. Like love. Do you believe in love? Love? I don't know. Do you really believe that love can last a lifetime? Of course, why not? I believe in love. I believe in marriage. Why don't you try it sometime? Kara, if it won't be too much of a hassle, can you bring me home? I've been calling my friend but she's not picking up. - Sure. - Thank you. Why don't you have dinner with us tonight? To return the favor of bringing me home. It's also my way of thanking you for getting my husband. I'm s o r 0 As a furniture supplier in your resort. It's not necessary but thank you for the kind offer. I insist. Is there a problem? No. So it's settled. Let's go. Here... - please prepare the steak outside. - Okay. You have a very nice home. Thank you. It might be new but it's already being infested. I think Ram would be happy to know you're here. I'm sure he'd even come home early. Looks like there's nothing that will keep him busy today. Is there anything I can do? Anything I can do to help you? Oh, no. You might catch me poisoning your food. Excuse me? Just kidding. Did you get scared? I'm sorry. My humor's a bit off lately. I'll just check the steak. Hi babe! Kara, do you cook? No. I've tried, but it's not for me. You should cook more. You know, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. But with that beauty, I'm sure you know a lot of shortcuts. Well, I have my ways but... right now, I'm not really looking for anything. I'm just playing around, having fun. I don't want to have a boyfriend yet. Oh my God, you don't have one? No. I don't want to get stressed. That's why look at me now. I'm fresh. Not haggard. You know love, if Kara would have a future husband... I'm sure he's going to be a very lucky guy. Right love? Avery lucky 9"!- That's why it's such a joy when you're loved by someone. And you know that he's only yours. Like Ram. What more can I ask for, right? Well any woman would be lucky to have Ram. So lucky you. That's why I married him. Because he's the one I want to be with forever. I might get crazy when I find out that he has another woman. I might kill the mistress. Both of them, actually. Cheers, gulls! Cheers! Why did you have to do it, Charmaine? It's such a shame... - treating my boss's daughter like that! - Such a shame? I thought nothing is going on between you and Kara. I'm just befriending her. - What's wrong with that? - You're befriending her? Really? Stop fooling me, Charmaine. You wanted to terrorize her. You want to tell her straight to her face that she's my mistress. If she's not, then she's not! What's your problem? Even if I keep telling you that there's nothing between us... you still make it seem like I'm cheating on you. Why are you acting that way? The Ram I know will never cheat. Because he doesn't want to be like my dad. Or worse, like your dad! Don't you ever compare me to my father! I really thought she was gonna stab me with that cheap steak knife. Of course because it was a scene straight out of a cheap soap opera! Kara what were you thinking? What if she stabbed you right there? Did you forget that you're Kara Zalderiaga?! - You can have any man you want! - You're better than that! Why did you have to undergo that, tell us now- Because I love Ram! That's all you wanted to hear right? I love him! What are you gonna do if the only man that you love is unfortunately married? Are you just going to accept defeat? Well, I won't! I'm not gonna give up Ram without putting up a goddamn fight! You asshole! I've been telling you before that that's trouble! If I were you, I'd break up with Kara. Wait, don't tell me you're now deeply into her? I'm telling you dude. How's Cha? Of course I'm going to choose her. I love my wife. You know that. - I can't lose her. - That's it. Now what are you gonna do with Kara? Hey... Kara, about last night... I want to apologize on how she treated you. I'm sorry I wasn't able to stop her. It's okay. I actually feel sorry for her. But tell her if she doesn't stop, I'd definitely fight back. Kara... I think this has to end. I'm struggling now. I think she knows. I don't know what to do. Okay. See you at work then. Don't forget to lock the door, please. Babe... About last night, I didn't mean to flare up like that. I overreacted, I'm sorry. Babe, talk to me please. Ram, when you come home and you see me, what do you see? What kind of a question is that? Do you still see the Charmaine you loved? The Charmaine you married? Or do you regret that you got married so early? Cha, I married you because I love you. I don't know what my life would be like without you. When I was so down and I couldn't even love myself... you were the only one who was there for me. Cha, I'd never forget that. Please. Forgive me. Babe, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are we okay now? Are we friends again? Ram, I love you. I love you, too. Only you. That's good! That's good! Let's go there. How are you? I'm okay, sir. Hi. Sorry if I had to come. Ram insisted. Well, I hope the both of you enjoy. Let's check in. He's intentionally hurting you! He's not worth your stress! Exactly! If you can't take the situation then get out of it. It's that simple, right? You should be an expert by now. Where's the Kara who dumps men so easily? What's happening to you? Kara? Is this how you work, Mr. Escaler? I didn't expect your furniture to be so weak. With a bit of pressure, it already gives. I'll have it checked with the factory, Kara, sorry. I guess you really can't stand by your promises. You're such a disappointment! Are you here to make a scene? Only if you're having an affair with my husband. So, are you? Is that why you're here? To catch us on the act? Well, if you're expecting some cheap cat-fight, it's not happening. I'm just guarding my husband. You know, a marriage is like an exclusive village. You have to guard it against squatters. Is that so? Well, here in our resort, we don't allow people who act like squatters. I'm surprised they let you in. What do you call those people who have affairs with married men? Oh yeah. Snakes. Is that your bikini or is that your skin? So that explains why you're such a good crawler. Yes, hasn't he told you yet? I can teach you if you want. So you'd stop being paranoid. And just so you know, yes I enjoyed your husband. And I'm sure the feeling is mutual. Tonight, as you are snoring, he'll come knocking at my door. You can call me anything you want. A snake, a bitch, other woman. But I will never be a pathetic, boring housewife. Hi babe, how's your swim? Babe... Charmaine, what's the problem? Hon... Charmaine, talk to me. What happened? - Charmaine. - Get off of me! Enough! I knew it! I knew it! But it still hurt when I heard it from her! It hurts, do you know that? It hurts! I've been stooping down! I shouldn't be doing this! But I'm doing this because I love you! I love you! Do you know that? Let go of me! You pigs! I feel like you defiled me! You defiled me! Enough. Enough, we'll fix this. Stop it, please. Let me go! This isn't me, but I'm doing this for you! This isn't me! This isn't me! Charmaine, please. Get off of me! I said get off of me! - You're one of a kind! - Are you here to confront me too? Are you trying to destroy my life? First the furniture, now my wife! Are you a lunatic? Why did you tell her? What do you want to happen? You find this funny, huh? It's amusing for you?! You think I'm gonna choose you over my wife? A woman like you! - A woman like me? - Yes, a woman like you! - What do you think of me? - What right do you have to get mad? You have no right! Aren't you the one who said you don't want to be a mistress? So why are you acting like such a jealous mistress, huh? Bullshit! Ram, don't you leave! You just used me, right? You used me! You didn't love me! Fucking answer me! Did you even love me? Did I love you? Is that what you wanted to hear? If I told you I loved you, would you stop this? We're over, Kara! We're over! - Ram, please... please don't. - Kara please. Please don't leave me! Please... please! Ram please don't leave me. Kara, I can't do this anymore. Please, I'll do anything! What do I have to do for you to love me? - Please don't leave me, please! - Kara... Please don't! Promise! I'm sorry. I can't do this. - Please! - I can't do this! No! No! Enough! - No! - Please... Enough... enough! Enough! - Charmaine, stop it! - You're a flirt! You're a nasty flirt! Enough! - Stop this! - Get off of me! Charmaine, stop it! Charmaine, stop it! You're a flirt! You're a nasty flirt! - Enough... - Let me go! Enough... Let me go! Enough... Good evening, ma'am. Leave it there. I'm going to Daddy. Ram, I'm giving up. Cha... Ram, why- What else do you want? Is there something wrong with what I cooked? Am I ugly'-  I don't know. I'm going mad just by thinking. Why? How were you able to do this? It hurts, Ram! It hurts! Let's go our separate ways. Cha, I know I've sinned against you. This is all my fault. You didn't do anything. You didn't do anything. Babe please, don't do this to me. Babe, please. Don't give up, please. I don't wanna lose you, please. Please... please don't... please... please babe. You got a lot of nerve showing up here. Mr. Escaler, I knew about your relationship with my daughter. And I thought you were different, Ram. Well I guess I was wrong. The saying is true after all. Whatever the tree, so is the fruit. You hated your father so much that you became like him. A piece of unsolicited advice, Mr. Escaler... maybe if you'd stop hating your father so much... you'll start being a good man. Five years, man. Five years of hard work and it's out the door just like that. I'm sorry bro. No, this is all my fault. Because of one stupid decision, I lost everything. You know what, bro? Whatever it is that you're going through right now... I know in time, you'd fix this. And I believe you'd be able to patch things up with her. That's impossible. Ram... Ram, can we talk? Please... Please, just talk to me! Ram, talk to me! Let's talk! Ram! Ram please... Ram! - What's his blood pressure? - 110 over 60. His wounds are deep. Call the lab and prepare the operating room. Yes, Doc. These are the things of your husband. Does he have a history of stroke? Hypertension? Any allergies? You have to answer all our questions. How can we operate on your husband? I'm not his wife. Okay, I'm sorry. Doc, I'm Mrs. Escaler. Is he gonna be okay? He's still under observation but we're doing the best we can. I didn't come here to bother you. I just really wanted to tell you something before I leave. I'm so sorry, for everything that I did. It was all my fault. It was so stupid of me to think that he can love me back. I didn't know that's how it is when you're in love. You'd lose your mind. I knew all along that what I'm doing is wrong. But I just kept trying to convince myself... that he might choose me. That he might love me. But at the end of the day, you're still the one he loves. He still comes home to you. He still chooses you. I'm not expecting you to forgive me. But please, forgive Ram. That's not for you to ask. Please. Leave. Hey... You're leaving? I just need to get away. And I've always loved New York. I'll be fine. I'm sure. - Ram, I'm so sorry. - Kara, don't be. We are both at fault here. I'm sorry. Hi. - Anita, how are you? - Hello, Ma'am. How's my BABY? Ram, it's Kara. Ba bl! Don't cry.
