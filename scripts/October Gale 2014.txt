HELEN: I called yesterday and told Ed to get the boat out. Stop worrying. HENRY: What about your patients? HELEN: Robert is covering them. HENRY: For how long? HELEN: I don't know. HENRY: You've never opened the cottage before. Let me come. Let me help you. HELEN: I don't want your help. I wouldn't mind the challenge. HENRY: I'm worried about you. You bulldozed Dad's garden. I would've taken care of it. HELEN: The garden was young when I was young and old when I was old and will die when I die. His words. You know I hate long goodbyes. I'll be fine. I have to do this alone. Oh, Henry. Don't forget to feed his fish. [EXHALE] [LAPPING WAVES] HELEN: Hey, Henry. No, it's okay. I told you I'd call. Well, everything's fine. Yeah. Well, blown fuse. No, flood lights. Hey, didn't your father have someone clean out the chimney last year? Yeah, that's what I thought. No, calm down. I'm not on the roof. No. I've got to get the fire started. I'll call you later. I'm alright. [PHONE BEEP] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [EXHALE] [BIRD CAWING] JAMES: Want me to read aloud to you? HELEN: Okay. JAMES: When he awoke at daylight again, there'd be no storm. Morning was bright, and clean-smelling... and cool. There was no sign of Wirt Sewell. JAMES: Sorry, I'm going to have to put that gum in your belly-button for a second, thank you. JAMES: Nor could Gault discover any evidence to suggest that the lanky express agent had been there at all. JAMES: You're not even into this. HELEN: Yeah I am, I'm listening, I'm listening, I love this. JAMES: What's the name of the book? What's the name of the book? HELEN: The Son of-- It's The Son of...

HELEN: [LAUGHING] HELEN: [HEAVY BREATHS] [PIANO MUSIC] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [FEMALE SINGER]: Never win and never lose  There's nothing much to choose  Between the right and wrong  Nothing lost and nothing gained  Still things aren't quite the same  Between you and me  [BOAT MOTOR STARTS] I keep a close watch on this heart of mine  I keep a close watch on this heart of mine  [BOAT MOTOR THROTTLES UP] I still hear your voice at night  When I turn out the light  And try to settle down  But there is nothing I can do  'Cause I can't live without you  Any way at all  I keep a close watch on this heart of mine  I keep a close watch on this heart of mine  I keep a close watch on this heart of mine  Hoo, hoo...

I'm two clicks away from the marina. Just off Guthrie Point. Over. ED: I'll be right out, Helen. Over. HELEN: Okay. [BOAT MOTOR] ED: Henry's not up yet? HELEN: Uh, no. He's back in Toronto. He'll probably be up in a month or so. ED: How long are you planning to stay? HELEN: Not sure. This was always James's favorite time of the year. ED: When the tourists aren't up yet. HELEN: Hm! Well, I'll give you a call when your boat's ready. Probably in a day or two. HELEN: The little one will have to do. I got it.

[VIOLIN AND PIANO SCORE] [BOAT MOTOR] [DISTANT THUNDER] [CLOSE THUNDER] [BOAT MOTOR LABORING] WILL: I was looking for Aspirin. HELEN: Did I tell you to take an Aspirin? Take those. WILL: Red sky in the morning, sailor's warning, huh? HELEN: What? WILL: No, it's just an old saying. HELEN: No, I know the saying. My husband says it all the time. WILL: Where's he at? HELEN: In the city. He's coming back later today. WILL: I'm William. Will. HELEN: Helen. You're bleeding again. [HEAVY BREATHING] HELEN: Put it back down. WILL: Okay. HELEN: Put it down. Just relax. Relax, relax it. Stay very still. WILL: Okay. HELEN: How'd you find me? WILL: You were the only light. You up for Easter then? HELEN: No. What happened? WILL: Don't worry about it. HELEN: What happened?! WILL: Some men attacked me, but don't worry about it. HELEN: Why didn't you go to the police? Do you own that boat? Do you own that boat? WILL: I borrowed the boat, I'll get it back. HELEN: Do you live around here? WILL: [SIGH] Sort of, yeah. HELEN: Stay very still. WILL: Okay. HELEN: Who shot you? WILL: I told you who shot me. Please... Just leave it. HELEN: Look... I fixed you up, you're not going to die. You need to leave as soon as the weather permits, okay? Just-- WILL: It's fine. I'll leave right now. Can you just give me a ride to the highway? HELEN: No, I can't do that. WILL: Alright, that's fine. Just point me in the direction of the road. I'll get out of your hair. HELEN: No, no-no-no. You don't understand. There's no road. We're on an island. The marina is far. I was just out in this. A storm's coming and the water is dangerous. You fall in that water, you freeze to death. WILL: Alright fuck it. I'll take my boat. HELEN: You'll die in five minutes in that little boat. WILL: I'll be fine. Take it, it's worth something. HELEN: I don't want your watch. WILL: Take it. I don't like favors. HELEN: It wasn't a favor. WILL: You saved my life, you didn't have to do that. Please take it. HELEN: Yes, I did. You wouldn't have lasted the night. I-- [WHISTLING WIND] WILL: Thank you. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] HELEN: Shit. [WHISTLING WIND] WILL: [COUGHING] Aw, fuck. WILL: I'm fine, go away. [COUGHING] [CLOSE THUNDER] HELEN: You're not from around here, I know that. WILL: I'm from Calgary. I really like your place. It's nice. HELEN: It's been in-- HELEN: It's been in my husband's family for, I don't know... A hundred years. What did you do out west? WILL: Nothing special. I mean, it's Calgary. HELEN: But-- WILL: No, I did a bunch of things. I did everything. The last thing I did I worked in the oil sands for a while. But I didn't like that too much. Needed to get out. HELEN: But how did you end up here? WILL: My mom, she grew up outside of Collingwood, so... She used to take me here when I was a kid. HELEN: William... Who shot you? WILL: As soon as it calms down outside I'll be on my way, I promise. HELEN: Fine. Good. Good. Oh, good. Good, good, good. HELEN: Do you want me to cook, John? We could make some fried pickles. JAMES: Yes. HELEN: You're up for fried pickles? JAMES: I don't know. HELEN: I'm delirious. JAMES: A little bit. HELEN: I worked this 16-hour day yesterday. 16 hours. JAMES: You need a foot massage. [APPROACHING MOTORBOAT] [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] AL: I say your boat. I didn't know you were up! HELEN: I had to open the cottage sooner or later. AL: I just wanted to make sure you're alright, you know. A big storm's coming in, there's thousands already out of power. HELEN: Oh! AL: They're saying she's a big one. WILL: Fuck! WILL: Hey, do you know that guy? HELEN: Yeah, sure. He can give us a ride. WILL: Listen to me, you cannot let him in. HELEN: What, why? WILL: Helen, if you let him in, we are both dead. HELEN: What? WILL: Shh. Get rid of him. HELEN: Oh... HELEN: Sorry it's not fresh. AL: Oh, that's alright. So, how have you been? HELEN: Oh, fine. Better. AL: Hey, how's the roof holding up? HELEN: No leaks. AL: Didn't take long, few days. We got a big snowfall this winter so I'm happy I insisted otherwise the whole roof could've caved right in, right? HELEN: I appreciate it, Al. Thank you. Do you want sugar? AL: Ah, no. Thank you. I didn't know you had, uh... I didn't know you had any visitors. HELEN: Oh, uh, a man. His boat washed up on my shore so... AL: Did you call the cops? HELEN: Well, I can't get a signal on my cell phone and the Pro-Line's in the shop, so... But I do need to get him into town. AL: Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure, of course. Of course, yeah. HELEN: Great. I'm going to grab a few things and... I'll get him and... AL: Okay, but I mean, you know that storm's coming fast, right, so... I mean they're saying it's going to be bigger than last October's. HELEN: Help. [RUSH OF AIR] [TENSE MUSIC] HELEN: What the hell? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [HOWLING WIND] HELEN: Oh. Ah!! HELEN: Ah!! [BUBBLES] [COMPLETE SILENCE] [EMOTIONAL SCORE] HELEN: Ah! Okay. Ah! WILL: [LAUGHING] HELEN: [LAUGHING] [RAIN] [HOWLING WIND] [FOOTSTEPS] [THUNDER AND RAIN] [FOOTSTEPS] WILL: Oh, fuck. HELEN: Did you hurt yourself? WILL: No, its fine. It's nothing. HELEN: Let me see. WILL: It's nothing. It's okay, doc. I promise. HELEN: What are you doing? WILL: What do you mean? What are you doing? What's the matter? Huh, what? HELEN: What's going on? I mean who's after you? I've known Al for years, I've treated his family. Why would he strand me here? What have you done to make people come after you to the middle of nowhere? What happened? WILL: [SIGH] It was an accident. HELEN: What? WILL: An accident. A bar fight got out of hand and um It was my fault. [THUNDER] And I did all of the time. All of the fucking time. But the guy's father he's not going to stop until he's killed me. HELEN: I mean, you... He's dead. Right? You killed him. WILL: I'm sorry I put you in danger. I'm sorry. HELEN: This-this-this-this... This isn't my problem. It's not my business. I... Get out of my house. WILL: Helen, I'm not leaving you. HELEN: I've had enough of this shit! Get out of my house. WILL: I'm not leaving you by yourself knowing what's coming. HELEN: I'm not by myself. WILL: You're not? Where's your husband. HELEN: He's gone. WILL: Gone? You mean dead? HELEN: Get out of my house. WILL: I'm not leaving. HELEN: Get out of my-- Get out of my house. God damn you! WILL: Ow, fuck me! Ah, fuck. Ah! HELEN: Oh, God. [PIANO SCORE] [LIGHT RAIN] [HOWLING WIND] [THUNDER] HELEN: You regret that one? WILL: I regret most of them, not that one. Emily's my mum's name. HELEN: That tattoo is not for your mother. WILL: I'm sorry about your husband. It's okay. HELEN: He got caught in a storm last October on the lake. Went out first thing in the morning to buy groceries. Never came back. He asked me to go with him but I was talking to a friend on the phone. Barely looked up. I just said... 'Don't forget your list'. Phone rang. 'Your husband was in an accident. Sorry, Mrs. Matthews.' I stood there holding the phone Gone. He left me a message asking me to call him. I keep wondering What- What did he want? I mean it's no one's fault but his. He shouldn't have tried to go through the storm. He should have waited it out. He never would have tried if I'd been there with him. I could have saved him. He would've turned back. [SIGH] [SNIFFLE] WILL: Hey. Give me your hand. HELEN: We spent our entire lives together. And he died alone. I'm really- I'm really sorry I hurt you like that. WILL: It's fine. HELEN: Ohh. [LAUGHS] [HEAVIER RAIN] [RUNNING WATER] WILL: How far is the marina? HELEN: 45 minutes. WILL: Well, how far is it in a storm? HELEN: Well, it's open water so Storms out here are like storms on the ocean. WILL: Alright. So about an hour, hour and a half then. HELEN: Yeah. About that. Or never. WILL: Alright. HELEN: Alright what? WILL: That guy that was here is going to take about an hour back to the marina, some more time to find his boss, then another hour back here so we got... Three hours, maybe less, before they're back for me. [TENSE SCORE] How many bullets you got? [DISTANT THUNDER] WILL: What are the woods like back there? Can they attack us from behind? HELEN: Impossible. Sheer rock, 30 feet. It's not going to happen from the back. We need to make it difficult from the front because once they come ashore we're in trouble. WILL: Yeah, I've seen that guy before. HELEN: Well, he's a local. He's done odd jobs for us over the years. Always in and out of jail. WILL: For what? HELEN: Just gambling debts. WILL: So he knows the area. HELEN: He knows it well. We come up just for the weekends he's spent his whole life here. [LIGHT RAIN] WILL: How good are you with that thing? HELEN: Very good. WILL: Good. HELEN: Do you want to make us some coffee? WILL: Sure. HELEN: Black. One sugar. [PIANO SCORE] [HEAVY RAIN AND WIND] WILL: Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing? We could use those! HELEN: I don't want a goddamn crowbar used against me. WILL: They've got guns, what are they going to want with an axe? HELEN: I don't want to find out. WILL: Okay, but I'm keeping the crowbar. We've got to do something about the dock. HELEN: Come on. WILL: Nope. Lights are out. HELEN: It's a blown fuse. [TESTS DRILL] WILL: Got it. HELEN: That's good. HELEN: Ah! HELEN: Maybe they won't make it. WILL: Yeah, the weather's pretty bad. HELEN: They might not make it. [HOWLING WIND, RAIN AND THUNDER] WILL: You alright? You want to play some cribbage? WILL: Good. Not great. Fifteen two, fifteen four, fifteen six, fifteen eight. And a pair for the win. [DISTANT THUNDER] HELEN: Who taught you to play anyway? Hm? WILL: Um, my brother. Yeah, we used to play a lot. HELEN: Are you close? WILL: Yeah, we were. You know, it's funny. You think you can always just turn it around. Like no matter what, you can just walk it back. But you can't. I know you know that. But there's this other part of you that knows you've got to get on with it. Like you never forget about it, you never forget. But you've got to get on with it. You just decide that this awful thing you make it count. From here on out, you make it count. HELEN: Another round? [OMINOUS SCORE] [CLOSE THUNDER] WAITRESS: Can I get you a beer? TOM: No thanks, love. WILL: Hey, Will. WILL: Hey. [BAR MUSIC] TOM: Any good? WILL: Yeah, it's good. TOM: 622 affairs? WILL: Yeah, I'm not there yet. The girl I was seeing gave it to me. TOM: Did it work out? WILL: Oh no. TOM: Was it worth it? WILL: Yeah. TOM: I bought a Thunderbird. WILL: [LAUGHS] WILL: She need a lot of work? TOM: Nothing that can't be fixed. WILL: How'd you find me, Tom? You always think there's going to be a little bit more time, you know. And it just runs out. Sorry about this, Will. [OMINOUS SCORE] [HEAVY WIND AND RAIN] [THUNDER] [ALL SOUNDS SEGUE TO A BOAT MOTOR] AL: There. That one, right there. HELEN: I'm scared. WILL: I'm scared too. Shit, but they found us. HELEN: Okay.

I mean they're there, right. TOM: We going to have to wade in? AL: No way, the water's freezing. We could uhh... Well, right there. How about that. [DRAMATIC TENSION SCORE] [APPROACHING BOAT MOTOR] HELEN: Oh God. [BOAT MOTOR THROTTLES UP THEN CUTS OUT] [TENSE SCORE] WILL: Fuck. HELEN: Oh! Oh, shit! WILL: Come on, come on. HELEN: Okay! I'm sorry. WILL: We need to separate. Use the rifle, don't hesitate. HELEN: No, no, no. If we separate, I can't protect you. WILL: He's not after you. Get the fuck out of here. Go! Go! HELEN: Will! Shit! AL: No one there. Must have gone in the woods, eh? So, if you want I'll go around the outside and you can shoot right in there. TOM: Okay. AL: Yeah? Alright. [TWIG SNAPS] HELEN: Shit. [FOOTSTEPS] HELEN: Oh God. HELEN: Ah!! Ah!! Oh, God. TOM: Really? TOM: This is nice. I like this. I could get used to this. I'm Tom. HELEN: Helen. TOM: Sorry you got caught up in all this. Well, this one's fun. Is that your husband? HELEN: Yeah. TOM: He a good guy? HELEN: I think so. TOM: Got any coffee? So what are you doing out here all alone, then? HELEN: Peace and quiet. TOM: I can understand that. I'm a city boy myself. 30 fucking years, it wears you down, I'm telling you. It's become so uncivilized. Do you know what I mean? Thank you. Did you love him? How long were you together for? HELEN: 32 years. TOM: A lifetime. HELEN: Not quite. TOM: Hm. HELEN: Huh. TOM: He's going to die tonight. Will, he's going to die tonight. I mean we're all going to die. But he's going to die tonight. Which is funny. Don't you think? I mean to know and then you get up in the morning you go about your day and then it's all over. You die. He's nothing like me, you know that. I was proud of that. And he was always a little bit timid. You know? [LAUGHS] A little bit fearful. He was sweet, really. He always took people at their word, you know. He was a He was a literal boy. He was a simple boy. Done work all over Calgary. A bit of roofing. A bit of brick-laying. [DOOR OPENS] AL: Hey, miss. Hey, I'm not going to find him by myself, right? I need help out there, right? I mean, it's pretty-- HELEN: Ah! TOM: Yeah, he's probably on his way to me anyway. People go through their lives they take them for granted, don't you think? I mean that everything's going to be fine and you can only fall so far and someone will be there to catch you. I never had that luxury. I always knew it was possible to fall and to keep falling. People like you and me, we can't afford to make a single mistake. HELEN: No. TOM: It's true, that. HELEN: Yeah. TOM: Right? HELEN: Oh, my God. [GASPING] TOM: You know, I always wanted to be a dad which is fucking ridiculous when I think about it. Now, I looked forward to it. And I fucking loved Will. I fucking loved him like he was one of my own, you know? I took him in when he was what? 10 years old? 10 years old. And I raised him up. I thought it'd be good for Chris, you know to have an older brother. Like, uh, someone to look up to. A good influence. You know, I mean, he was an angry little fucker you know. But I loved him. And I loved his mom. And then when she died he didn't have anyone else so I just took him in and I raised him up. He's a lot like me, really. Hard as fucking nails. But he was supposed to look after my Chris. And do you know what he done? Do you know what he fucking done instead? He fucking killed him. And I don't care what story Will told you it's all a load of fucking bullshit because my Chris would never, ever put his hands on a fucking woman. I've had enough of this. HELEN: Oh, my- Oh, my God. WILL: [HEAVY BREATHING] TOM: How are you doing, Will? WILL: I've been better. [SOMETHING ROLLS ACROSS THE FLOOR] [RAIN FALLING] TOM: Come here. Give me a hug. WILL: [GASPS] WILL: I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. TOM: Sorry about this. [RIFLE BLAST] WILL: [GASP AND BREATHS] [ETHEREAL MUSIC] [PIANO SCORE] JAMES: Hey, my love. You're not going to believe what just happened. Anyway I love you.

HELEN: Thank you. WILL: Hey. It's nice out, huh? HELEN: Yes. Beautiful. WILL: Yeah, it's sunny so it's nice. HELEN: Just perfect. I'll miss you. Where will you go? WILL: I don't know. Away I guess. HELEN: Hm. Away sounds good. WILL: And you? HELEN: Back to Toronto. Back to work. [SIGH] Back to life, I guess. WILL: You know, if you're not doing anything...
