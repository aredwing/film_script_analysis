Still, you have to work at it to get noticed by the right guy. Megan. Later. Hey, are you okay? Yeah. Why? You weren't at the Johnsons' last night for the service project. Oh, that. I had plans with Kim and some others. I thought you were in charge of it. I handed it off to someone else. It went fine, right? No big deal. What'd you do last night? We went to Pyro's. The club. You went clubbing on a Tuesday night? It's ladies' night. Linda: Mark? Yes? Your meeting with Mr. Davidson is about to start. Thank you. What are you doing here? Davidson asked him to come. So, do you guys know what this is all about? I have no idea. Good. We can start. Hansu Technologies is licensing our C25 chip. That's the Chinese company, right? This is gonna be used for their new wireless media player. They're finally ready to move forward on it. They're getting ready to manufacture it at their Indonesia plant, so I want you there. Great. You know this thing inside and out, so I need you to make sure they don't change their minds. Done. And, uh, Megan. You'll be handling this account as we move forward. Me? You excel in your responsibilities. You show great promise. Plus, Mark here thought it might be a good fit. Thank you. Chris, you'll help with the technical implementation. Yes, sir. Paul can't come? His wife is due any day. And I understand Chris here speaks Chinese. I do. You speak Chinese? I thought we were going to Indonesia. Most of their top executives are Chinese. It could be useful. Check with Linda for your travel arrangements. You leave tomorrow. That's it. Thanks. Mark:- See you tomorrow. It's just a business trip. I know. So, what are you so excited about? I'm finally getting somewhere. Did you hear what he said? Yeah, that's pretty flattering. And I get to travel and see the world. And spend some time with Mark Taylor. - There is that. Isn't he a bit old for you? I just heard. You get to go somewhere with Mark. How'd you hear so soon? - Linda. So, it's just you and Mark? No. Chris is going, too. Oh. Thanks. And it's just business. What are you gonna wear? I have no idea. Oh, it's okay. I'll come over after work. Exciting meeting? What? I get to go on a trip with Mark Taylor. Wow. I know 15 women in this office who would kill to be you. That's a first. You don't want to go? Would you? He'll sweet-talk his way past everyone, and then double-cross them. He took all the credit for the work we did on the C25, and he got Brett fired and moved us to the basement. You think he's changed? No. But I don't know. Mark's going places. He's already upper management. Pretty soon, he's going to be chief something-or-other. Might not be a bad idea to let it go, get on his good side. Why should I trust him? Do you really want to back out of the trip? No. At least there's an upside. Megan's going, too. Really? Maybe you'll finally ask her out. I'm just waiting for the right moment. Yeah. How's that working out for you? Mm, too tame. Uh... Ooh! What? Are you going to a funeral? Oh, uh... Why not? [ doorbell rings ] Hang on. Don't mind me. Hey, Chris. Hey. Got your itinerary. Oh, I forgot to pick it up. Linda came looking for you, but you'd already left. So I told her I'd bring it by. There's a commercial flight to Malaysia, then some jet to, uh, Kupang -- Kupong. Thanks. You have your passport, right? Um... Hang on. You know, I know I have one. That's good. Where is it? So, how do you know Chinese? I did a study-abroad thing in college. Really? That's a weird choice. Smart choice. Normally, I'd assume that's where you served your mission. Yeah, I wanted to go, But by the time I was baptized and waited a year, I was past the cutoff age. Well, I hope we can explore a little while we're in, um... Uh... Indonesia. Right. I don't know if we're gonna have much time for fun on this trip. Why not? It's business. A day to travel there, a day back, two days of meetings, not to mention the time difference. We'll make time for fun. That'd be nice. You know, I -- I don't get to see you a whole lot outside of work. Uh, is that your subtle way of bugging me about going to church? Not really. Well, you know, I've just been so busy. Hey, it's your life. Thank you. Doesn't mean I don't worry, though. Worry? Chris, I -- Oh, found it! Still valid? Uh. Yes. Shoes! - Shoes! Uh... Well, I'll just leave you girls to your shoes. Yeah. Thanks for bringing that over. Gossiping about guys. Yeah. Oh. Those kill my feet. But they look so sexy. So, what did Chris want? I forgot something at work, so he brought it for me. Oh. That was nice of him. Yeah. No. It's not like that. We go to the same church. Really? I didn't ever peg you as the churchy type. Now, Chris, that actually explains so much. A swimsuit. Oh. I don't think we'll be going swimming at all. Do you want to risk that? Uhh, don't you have a bikini? Yeah, but I don't wear it that much. You do now. Where is it? Oh, much better. You're so lucky. Everyone at work was talking about you today. Nothing nice, I bet. Oh, no, just gossip. They're just jealous. Why? Nothing's going to happen. Besides, Chris will be there. Everyone was worried until they heard that. If it was just you and Mark, you guys would probably end up coming back an item. I doubt it. And, besides, he's always dating someone. Yeah, that someone could be you. Morning. - Hi. Oh, thank you. Hot chocolate. Can I have a sip? It's really hot right now. - That's okay. It's not hot chocolate. I'm really tired, okay? Then get more sleep. It's medicinal. Plus, I want to be awake on the plane. Most people like to be asleep on planes. Well, what if Mark needs something? Megan... Good morning. Hi, Mark. Nice bag. Megan's. You guys should get checked in. I'll see you when we land. You're not flying with us? Yeah, but I'm in first class. Of course you are. [ whistles ] Not bad. Should be better than coach. Can't be worse. [ cellphone rings ] Hello? Hi, Jenna. Oh, here. Huh? Oh. Do you always carry that? I'm a tech guy. Uh-huh. MacGyver. I had a lot of fun, too. Well, sure. I'm out of town right now, but that'd be fun. No, no. I'll call you this time. I promise. Okay. Sorry. Girlfriend? No. Just a date. It didn't work out? Well, I just prefer somebody a little closer to my height. What? Is she short? Yeah. She can't be that short. Well, when you look at her, you just assume she's further away than she really is. When she's right next to you, you just can't ignore it. Look, don't judge me. I don't really like dating. It's worth it when you find someone, but, otherwise, it's just date after date after date. Sounds real tough. You know what I'm talking about. Well... Or not. Come on. It can't be that bad for you. You're probably breaking hearts every weekend, aren't you? No, not really. This is going to be fun. Okay, a few things to remember. Hansu Technologies needs us just as bad as we need them, but don't let them know that. Be professional, but keep the upper hand. And don't do anything to mess this up. What's the scope of the contract? Deal points on page 4. We need to memorize these, okay? I don't want any confusion on our part. There's some power issues with this chip for what they need. It might be better to have a different configuration. Just tell them what they need to hear, okay? [ alarm beeping ] Man: what was that? Man #2: I think it was a bird. We're losing power. Reduce speed. Is everything okay? Mr. Taylor, stay in your seat and strap in. Well, what happened? Left engine's failing. What's going on? - Left engine's on fire! Pull the fire handle. Are we going to be okay? We're losing fuel pressure in the right engine. Switching frequencies. Mayday, mayday, mayday. Control, this is a distress call for Nancy 294 Tango Lima. Mayday, mayday, mayday. Nancy 294 Tango Lima has lost power in its left engine. Losing power in the right. We're descending rapidly. Request immediate assistance. We're still falling too fast. Control, this is Nancy 294 Tango Lima, losing altitude. No one's answering. Take over on radio. Mayday, mayday, mayday. Any ATC, repeat, any Control Center. Nancy 294 Tango Lima is losing altitude. We're drifting off course. We can't hold it. There's something ahead. Anywhere to land? - Maybe. We're not going to make it. We're gonna try a water landing. Nose up! Mayday, mayday, mayday! Nancy 294 Tango Lima is going down. [ alarm beeping ] [ gasps ] Where's Megan? Did you get the raft? What? So we don't drown! What raft? The plane had one, didn't it? Megan! You should have grabbed it! Help me find her. What about sharks? Megan! Come here. You're okay. Megan. Are you okay? Yeah. Over there! It's not too far. Think you can make it? Where are the pilots? I think I'm going to be sick. It's okay, all right? Just -- Just breathe. Chris. Come here. What's this? Cellphone. Do you think we get reception out here? You're the tech guy. Maybe it'll help. Are you hurt? My neck is stiff. He's stiff-necked. Where do you think we are? Indonesia, I think. Where, though? Were we even close to Kupang? All I know is we're on an island. There's over 17,000 islands in Indonesia. That doesn't narrow it down. Great. Seriously? Hello! What are you doing? I don't think anybody heard you. Well, why don't we use the cellphone? Hello? Anyone out there? There's nobody here. Not that we can see. The last thing we want is thinking we're stranded, and there's actually a town or resort half a mile away. Hello? Is anybody there? I couldn't find anything close-by. Maybe tomorrow we can search some more. Plus, we need to find some water. I could use some right now. Yeah. It's getting kind of dark. We'll have to wait till morning. With any luck, someone will have come for us by then. Yeah, someone had our flight plan, right? What about the black box? Actually, that's for when they find the wreckage. Oh. But someone had to notice, right? Of course. I'm sure someone noticed when we went off radar. Plus, they're expecting us to land. Between those two things, they'll be looking. What the... I'm ready to go home. Uh. Rocks don't make good pillows. You sore? It's just my back. Come here. Huh? Uh. Oh. Ohh. Oh, yeah. Right there. Hey, do you guys see that? Mark: Chris, go check it out. You're not coming? Dude, these shoes have no traction. Be careful. Thirsty? Is that even good? Yep. Hey, Mark! What is it? My bag! I don't suppose mine made it. That brick? That's at the bottom of the ocean. Here. You want to take this back? [ gasps ] Mark: what is it? Chris: It's one of the pilots. Why don't you take that bag and see what we can use? Mark, give me a hand. With that? Him. Yes. Well, he's dead. We can't leave him here. Why not? Remember the tide? Do you want him washing up in the middle of the night? Better to lay him to rest. Thanks for all you did. I'm so thirsty. We should have had something ready to drink. Hey, you had some orange juice. Besides, that needed to be done. Fine. It's done. Now we should seriously think about getting some water. I'm all for it. We can use these and refill them. And I can finally get out of this shirt. Wow. What? Wasn't me. Hey, can I use these? Sure. I can fix those. Oh, thanks. There you go. Thanks. I'll buy you a new pair of jeans when we get back. Don't worry about it. They look a little loose. I'm glad, 'cause if we were the same size... Here. Try this. Huh? Uh. Sorry. You get the idea. Not bad. Let's go. I'm not sure we should all go. What do you mean? What if a rescue comes? If we're in the middle of the island, they can't find us. You really think they're gonna find us that quickly? I'm a V.P. in the company. Of course they'll come. All right, you can stay. But it's gonna be awhile before we find water and bring it back to you. Plus, if we're lucky, we'll find some food. Okay. I could really go for a burger right now. Or a nice cut of filet mignon. I'm up for any food. There's always that. I'm not that hungry. Hey, can you guys wait a minute? What's wrong? Nothing. Where are you going? Uh... Nature's calling. Be careful. So, how do you know Megan? Aside from work? Yeah. We go to the same church. Really? So, she's like a religious type? I was talking. Mark, catch. Oh, there you are. Fruit? Wow. No bugs. Hey, look what Mark got us. Well, if we don't find water, we can make juice. We should also see what else we can find to eat. There's always fish. Gross. What? I don't like seafood. I don't think you're gonna find a cow on the island. I can dream. Do we even know where we're going? Not really. So, we could be walking in circles. Who knows? I left the map back at the beach. Great. We are doomed. [ chirping ] Hey, if you think you can do better... I don't think. I know. Megan: Guys. - Lead the way. Do you hear that? I will. They're just birds. Those aren't birds. Bats! Go! [ all screaming ] Bats! Bats! Bats! Get away! Get away! Water! Water! You screamed like a girl. I am a girl! I was talking about Mark. I hope Hansu Technologies doesn't back out. Seriously? That's what you're hoping for? Well, word is gonna reach our competitors. I don't want to lose the deal 'cause we took too long. I think we have bigger problems. It's hard to think of work when we're here. You're right. Chris told me something that caught me off guard. What? Church? He told you about that? It's cute. Sure, it is. I've never heard that one before. I've never known any church patrons, or whatever you call them. I don't know that I'm a... it's just church. Chris: What's that? We were just talking about how you two know each other. Oh. We should start to get back. Why did you tell him? What? You told him about church. Yeah, so? You don't tell anyone about that. Why not? It's a part of you. No. I mean, yes, but... What? Are you ashamed of it? No. I'm sorry. I don't broadcast it like you do. I've dealt with this my entire life -- the questions, the rules, the restrictions. It's not that easy for me. It might not be, but that's kind of the point, isn't it? Sure, you say that. Your full name is Christopher Thomas Russell. C-T-R. "Choosing The Right." It's practically who you are. She knows my full name. Have you heard? - It's awful. What? The charter plane went down yesterday. What plane? The plane with Mark, Megan, and Chris. Nobody knows where it is or if anyone even survived. They're searching for them, and nobody's heard anything yet. They crashed? You really think this is gonna work? I figure it's worth a shot. I'm open to suggestions. I say we keep somebody on the beach at all times. What? To flag them down? If they're looking for us, why not? The beach would be the easiest place to find us. Doesn't hurt. The more we try, the better. What about a fire? Okay, so, if we see anything come by, we light the signal fire. Do you think the tide will be a problem? We're far enough away from the water. It should be fine. We should probably build a shelter tomorrow. You really think we're going to be here awhile. I'd rather be ready for it than not. You know, I hate to admit it, but he's probably right. I was thinking for a roof. What do you think? Sure. No. Put it up here. Fine. No. This way. Be my guest. What's your problem? My problem? Yeah. I'm not blind. You got a problem, just tell me. That is so Mark Taylor. What? You don't know what you're doing. You don't do anything. You just sweet-talk everyone, flash your little smile, And take credit for their work. Are you still hung up on that? You got where you are because -- I got where I am because I work hard. I may not be the hands-on guy, but I know what I'm doing. You sure do. What are you doing? Seeing if there's anything we might have missed. Did you find anything? Nope. I knew there was a raft! You doing okay with all this? Yeah. You're handling this better than I thought you would. The crash? I thought you'd be like every other woman in the office, who, let's face it, would be freaking out. Then again, they'd be completely awestruck by you being here. You know, I kind of get tired of all that. You do? Yeah, it's every guy's fantasy to be chased by women. But everyone seems to put me on this pedestal. They don't see the real me. Is the real you better or worse? Both. At least you're honest. Well, I'm not perfect. But there's more to me than just... money, success, good looks? Sure, point them all out. But that's exactly what people see first. So, what's the cure? Give away the money? Fail? Smear a little mud on your face? No. Just find someone who can see more than that. We should get back. Make sure Chris hasn't torn apart the shelter and built a computer. Are you putting on cologne? The benefits of having your stuff wash up. Do you mind? What are you doing? I'm seeing what we have in case we can use it. That's not whipped cream. Thanks. How would it help? Not sure yet. I know fruit is healthy, but a little variety would be really nice. Hey, Chris, can I borrow your knife? I thought you hated fish. At this point, I'm willing to give it a try. Can I help? Please. I don't even think I was close. Oh! Are you sure this even works? Nope. Hurry! Hurry! Right there! Oh. Mark: Almost. Great. Ooh. [ chuckles ] Aah. Ugh. Ah. Wait. I think I got it! Flammable. Hmm. Yeah! Ohh! You got one! Hey, look what we got. Now what? We gut it. Really? Well, I'm going to go see what else I can find. I'll be back in a while. Um... I'm gonna go with you. Mark, you've got the signal fire? You guys don't want fish? I'm okay. I'll just put it on ice, then. I can still smell it. The fish? Ugh. I'm going to go out on a limb That you don't like sushi, either. Nope. Can't get past the seaweed stuff. It's not the fish that bothers you? Yeah, I don't know. I never got that far. What was that? Manna from heaven. What are you doing? Don't you want one? Well, yeah, but... I'll just climb up there. Are you sure you can get up there? I got it. I'm sure. Just watch. Nice. Just watch. Okay. [ laughs ] Are you all right? Okay, so, maybe I need to rethink this. Okay. Better. Come on. Okay, now I'm impressed. Nice work. Well... Megan. Do you see that? A boat! Mark! Mark! Mark, light the signal! Mark, light the signal! A boat! What boat? Hurry up, man! Hurry up! You're trying to light a big log. Get the little stuff. What were you doing? The boat was right there. You couldn't light it fast enough! I wouldn't have to if you'd been awake! Where's the boat? You really think this is going to work? Those ships are miles out. The whole island would have to be on fire for them to notice. You are so... What? You're right. We need a better solution. That looks good. If we had some black pepper and some lemon, This would be first-class. You cook? Shh. Don't tell the girls in the office. It's our secret. Oh, shut up. How do you open this? Here. I'll do it. Where is my knife? Thanks. What about a flare? What? For a way to signal help. Unless a flare gun washes up, we're out of luck. No, but... You keep thinking. I'm hungry. And dinner is served. Wow. I thought you didn't like fish. It can't be that bad. Should we bless it? Mark, do you mind if we... Chris, we don't need to. Go ahead. Do you want to say it? No. John. Watch it. Sorry. Are you okay? I'm fine. Everyone's fine, apparently. Nobody's heard anything more yet. Until we do, we just have to hope they're all okay. I thought all the women would still be crying over Mark. You have not been to the women's bathroom recently. No, I haven't. Look, you're not alone. I can't believe how excited I was for Megan. A chance to go on a trip, with Mark and all. And now... What if it had been me? That's what you're worried about? You? No, it's not -- They could be treading water right now. There could be sharks nipping at their legs. They could already be... I hope Megan's okay. I hope they're all okay. Hey, if they're alive, Chris will take care of Megan. You think so? I know so. Does Chris like Megan? I didn't say that. So, he doesn't. No. Well, it's kind of... I knew it. I cannot even wait until Megan gets back. She might believe it. It's kind of obvious. Come on, this isn't just some juicy gossip. Two seconds ago, you were practically grieving. Have some sense of decency. Didn't your mom ever tell you not to swim alone? You were sleeping. Where's Mark? It's his day to find fruit. That reminds me. I need to get the water. Do you want some company? Don't you have to man the beach? Not if Mark gets back. Besides, it'll give him some time to work on his tan. So, you don't like Mark. Wow. That wasn't even a question. Why? Why don't I like him? Yeah. I just don't think he's everything he pretends to be. Who said he's pretending? He's a nice guy. Can be. You don't know him like I do. And you don't know him like I do. Come on, Megan. A few days ago, he was "Mark Taylor" to you. A lot has happened since then. I just don't see how you can fall for him. It. Why do you care if I like him or not? I don't. I just -- I don't want you to forget who you are. Thanks, Dad. Hey, I've seen it. You're changing. Change is a good thing. Not all the time. What do you know? Oh, come on. Don't act like I'm blind. When you got your job at the company, you know what made me notice you? You were in the breakroom, reading The Book of Mormon. Every day you did that. There was something different about you. Yeah, it's called being a dork. No. It's called cherishing something. Because of your example, I asked about what made you different, what gave you that light in your eyes. It made me realize I was missing something in my life. How can you be ashamed of that now? I'm not! You got all embarrassed about praying. I didn't want to force it on Mark. - Nice excuse. What about not going to church? - I go. Or clubbing all weekend, or working even on Sunday? When I met you, you never would have done that. You never would be justifying drinking coffee and lattes because it's "medicinal." That was different. - Sure, it was. Growing up in the church, it's so restricting. You don't know what it's like. What? How could I understand because I'm a convert? Yeah! I still had to make changes, but it was worth it. But for me -- You can rationalize it all you want. But until you get past the excuses and think about it honestly, you're just lying to yourself. Get past the excuses, Megan. Don't be ashamed. I am ashamed. Of you! Why don't you try to deal with what I face? Walk a mile in my shoes! These aren't even shoes! Ugh! Nice. Thanks. Where's Megan? She's not back? No. I thought you guys went to go get water. We split up. A little help here. She's still not back. It's going to get dark soon. Let's go find her. Megan! What did you guys fight about anyway? Who says we fought? I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. Just a guess. It's complicated. Wait. Do you guys have a thing going on or something? What? No. No? Okay. Well, we're just... friends. - Right. Good. I've known her awhile, and I worry about some of the things she's mixed up in. What? Like drugs? No, nothing like that. Megan's a grown woman. She knows what she's doing. I hope so. What was that? Just because somebody knows what they're doing doesn't mean it's right. Why do I get the feeling you're turning this on me? I'm not trying to make you feel guilty or anything. Megan! Just level with me. Last year, you took credit for what wasn't yours. You get that, right? You see it that way. We all agreed to work on the C25 together, but I was the Manager. I get blamed for the failures. And the successes? It was our success. That's not what you told everyone. It doesn't matter. Who do you think they want to succeed? You have to be in front of the pack and appeal to what they expect. If you want success, you have to make it and take it. Maybe you're just not cut out for it. Maybe it's not worth it. Not like that. Where's the... is this my punishment? I only missed a few Sundays. I wonder if she made it back to the beach. She's got the internal compass of Hansel and Gretel, without the breadcrumbs. Well, we haven't found her. You think? Megan! Nope. Still no Megan. You're welcome to go back to camp at any time. Let's split up. Fine. [ thunder crashes ] Aah! Megan! Chris! Mark! Megan! Megan, can you hear me? Heavenly Father, I'm sorry. Please help. Help! Chris! - Megan? Hello? Megan! Chris? Can you climb up to me? It's too steep. I keep slipping. Hang on! Grab the vine. I'll pull you up. Come on, I've got you. It's okay. Okay. I slipped. I can tell. How'd you get up here? I was trying to get back to the beach. You're on a cliff. Beaches are at sea level. I don't know where everything is. I thought it might get me back. Okay. I'm sorry about before. I didn't want to make you mad. I know. Megan, I want you to be happy. And I know I go about it the wrong way. Mark: Megan! Are you okay? I am now. Let's get you cleaned up and back to the fire. Come on. Mark: It's almost done. You want some water? Sure. Thank you. For finding me. I'm glad you weren't hurt. Here. - Thanks. Should we, um... Should we pray? Go for it. I never got into it, but... Really? God requires too much time. I'm busy enough as it is. I'll say it. I could use another one of these. Can I have the shell when you're done? What for? Um... Remember that flare idea? You found a flare? No. I'm making one. You really think you can make one? Contents under pressure. When they get hot, say by fire, they explode. Put all that in a coconut shell with the flame, It might work. You take yourself too seriously. So, it's a mini bomb. Isn't that dangerous? I'm not saying I'm gonna hold it up when I light it, but if it works... If. What about somebody seeing it? From a distance? I haven't thought that far. You can say that again. It's clever. Why aren't you intimidated by him or by what anyone else thinks? Especially church? I feel like everyone looks down on us and what we believe. Do they? I didn't when I met you. Yeah, well, you're a rare exception. I think most people respect what you believe. It doesn't feel that way. You're letting it bother you more than it should. Sure, believing in god, trying to do what's right. It makes us stand out a little. A little? What's more important? What everyone else thinks or what God thinks? I've heard that before, but it's not that simple. Sure, it is. Not for me. It can be. Look, for me, I'd be crazy if I gave up something I know is true for what everyone else thinks is more important. Fame. Wealth. Respect. Those aren't all bad things. No, not if you have your priorities straight. Was it a hard adjustment for you? Yeah. But it was worth it, because it's true. God is real, and he loves us. What else matters? Mr. Davidson. Have a seat. John, you've been taking on a lot of Chris Russell's work. Yes, sir, until he gets back. There's a reality we have to face. We have to move forward, and that means making changes. You've been doing a good job, so we'd like you to take over for Chris permanently. But when he comes back, then... If he gets back, we'll adjust. Keep up the good work. See anything? Minnow. Filling. Any luck? Not yet. Oh, I'll be right back. Thanks. Are we going to have anything to cook today? The fish aren't cooperating. I'd love to go for anything besides just fish. Like... Chinese food. Well, if I see any Szechuan Chicken running around, I'll let you know. I'd even settle for Indonesian food. I was looking forward to that. If we made it without any problems, we wouldn't care. We'd probably be wishing we had a burger. That's true. I guess sometimes we just take things for granted that are right in front of us. Yep. Like matches. I've got a whole drawerful in my kitchen next to the candles, and here it takes Chris forever just to light a fire. Candles? So? They smell nice. Boom. Didn't you say something about swimming alone? This reminds me of my sister's place. She lives near a beach? Yeah. I spent a summer there a couple years ago. It was actually right before I decided to get baptized. It's a good place to get away, clear your head, find the answers that you're searching for, you know? It's also about five minutes away from McDonald's. I wish we were there now. Was your family okay with you getting baptized? They thought it was weird that I wanted it. My parents had some concerns, but they're cool with it now. Hey, I was thinking. Yeah? Um... I, uh... We both work a lot, and I see you there. Okay. But it'd be nice if I could see you, you know, somewhere else. Chris, I get it, okay? I know I need to be better about going to church, but you just have to let me. No, that's not what I meant. Really? I was hoping -- - Hey! Do you guys have any more water? No, but I can go get some. Are you sure? - Yeah. Okay. I was just hoping we could go out sometime. Did you say something? No. Does it ever feel like something always gets in the way of what you want? Sure, sometimes. It's pretty annoying. That's why you got to keep trying and never give up. Although, if you keep trying and still don't get anywhere... It just depends on how bad you want it. If you quit, you're guaranteed to fail. I'm going to get some fruit. Megan. We've always had a great friendship. I really value that. It's just I... always wanted something more. No. Get to the point faster, before something interrupts. [ sighs ] Megan, hi. Aah. Great! Could work. Megan, I just think that... Hey. - Hey! Came to make sure you didn't get lost again. I got here, didn't I? Yeah. I was just thinking. I wonder how everyone is back at home. Probably business as usual. Come on, someone would miss us. You, sure. Don't you have family? Yeah, but I think I have some old girlfriend listed as my emergency contact. Well, she'd call them. It didn't end well. She'd probably be celebrating if she thought I was dead. Wow. What about you? They're out of State, but they're probably panicking. Hey. They'll be fine. We'll get back. Megan, when I think of a flower... I've hit a new low. Okay. Just what I want her to know. How I feel. Megan, I like you. Smooth. Just blurt it out, Chris. Smart. You are so smart, Chris. Okay, how about... It could have been worse. I keep telling myself that. If you didn't come on the trip, it'd be Chris and me stuck here. A nightmare for you both. I'm glad you came. I wouldn't have it any other way. What about your girlfriend? Jenna? No. Or any of the other girls you date? I've got a bit of a reputation, don't I? I didn't mean that. The girls I've dated, they're fun, but that's it. There's nothing more to it. I know that sounds awful. They just try to get my attention, Instead of being the type of girl that just catches your attention automatically. Like you. Listen, Megan, if nothing else, I just thought you should know in case you felt the same... ...way. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't cross some line. Yeah. No, it was fine. You sure? I don't want it to be awkward for us. I'm sure. Good. Not awkward. I finally broke things off, and I was so relieved. That totally reminds me of this guy that I dated. Hey, where have you been? Working. What's this? Catapult. Is this what you've been working on? Yeah. Why? I'm ready to get off this island. What's it for? To launch the flare. Give that back. Seriously, Chris. Is this the best you can come up with? Tell you what. You think of something better with the resources we have, and you can criticize me all you want. What are you looking for? Cologne. Won't help with the smell. Have you seen my shaving cream? Yeah. Hey! What's his problem? I don't know. Hey. Hey. Is this what you've been doing? Yeah. You built a catapult. Wow. Why didn't you ask us for help? I didn't know how much support I'd get. Plus, you were caught up in other things. You know, you're not so subtle. Sorry. Mark's really sweet, even more than I thought before. I didn't think that was possible. Come on, don't do that. Be happy for me. If you're happy, I guess that's all that matters. I just don't want you to get hurt. I won't get hurt. When we get back, do you think he's going to be as sweet? Do you ever wonder why he always has a new girlfriend? You'll start to see who he really is. I like who he is. You like who you think he is. There's a difference. Why are you being so mean about this? - I'm not. I'm just trying to get out of here. You two may be happy to stay here forever, But I'm not going to stick around as the third wheel. What? I can't take this. What are you talking about? You really don't know? - No. I'm talking about you. Us. I've been trying to tell you for the longest time, But you barely even notice me when Mark's around. I like you, Megan. A lot. But now I'm not even sure why. I mean, do we still believe in the same things? Don't question what I believe. Just because I don't make a spectacle of my testimony doesn't mean I don't believe. Your actions are a reflection of your beliefs. You're trying so hard to fit in and be accepted that you're compromising the things that really matter. You know what? I'm tired of you always judging me. Nothing I do is ever good enough. I'm never strong enough, not the perfect person you want me to be. Why don't you stop being so self-righteous and let me be who I am? You're right. I just worry about you, probably more than I should. I just see these glimpses of the Megan I fell in love with. It doesn't matter. I guess you've made your choice. Where have you been? Just thinking. I can't. I can't take it anymore. Please. This is my limit. [ crying ] Help me. Please. What's that? Is that really what I think it is? Plane! It's a plane! Wait! Hey! Come on, where are you? I can hear it. There! Hey! - Hey! Hey! - Hey! Down here! - Down here! Hey! - Come on! Help! Wait! Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Come on. Please work. Chris' flare! Over here! He's turning around! Down here! They see the flare! Come on. Down here. Hey! Hey! Down here! Yes! Yes! Over here! Over here! Yes! Hey! I think he sees us. Yeah! Yes! Come on! We're going home! Yeah! - Hey! Yes! Yes. [ knock on door ] Hey. - Hi. Wow, you look great! - Thank you. Not bad for your first day back at work. It's too bad about those shoes. I can't believe you and Mark are a thing. I don't know what the rest of us are going to do. But there's a new guy. Not only is he tall and rich, he's divorced. Congratulations. I was going for "glad you're alive," but this was all they had left at the bakery. I think it confused some people. Nice. Just glad to have you back. Thanks. Hey, Mark. Hey. So, um, I owe you a new pair of jeans. Oh, thanks. Do you want to get something to eat tonight? Some Chinese food? I can't. I've got too much to catch up on. Megan: What's the occasion? Chris: Being alive. John got it for me. Nice. People I've never met kept stopping by my desk and eating it. The cake, not my desk. Got it. So, crazy day, huh? Not really. John pretty much was me while I was gone. Not much for me to do. Uh... Hey, in all of this, I didn't get the chance to thank you. You got us home. The plane helped. It wasn't all me. But they never would have seen us, and it's not just that. You really saved us. You're welcome. Listen, about what happened, I wanted to apologize. You were right about me judging you. I shouldn't have said -- you... You don't have to apologize. I just wanted you to know that I'm glad you introduced me to the gospel. Going back to not having that in my life, I can't imagine it. Knowing that I'm not alone makes all the difference. Uh. You're, uh... You're welcome. Look, today is my last day. Okay, I'm ready. Let's go. I'll talk to you later. Hi, john. - Hi. Need a hand? Something you want to tell me? I'm leaving. Whoa. Did they fire you? No, it's not that. It's, um... It's time. Chris. I need to move on. So, how did you survive? We ate fruit and coconuts, anything we could find. But then I got to thinking, "what about fish?" So I made this spear. I go knee-deep in water and just waited. Wow. Skip to the end. You guys haven't even heard the best part. Tell them about how you got everyone off the island. So, I gather up all my stuff, mousse and shaving cream, and we put the stuff in coconuts so we could make a flare. Then I got to thinking, "How are we gonna get these flares up in the air?" So we build this catapult, right? Hey, John. Hey. Where's Chris? He's gone. Oh. Do you know when he'll be back? He quit. He did? When? Yesterday. You saw him. He didn't even say goodbye. Maybe he didn't get a chance. Did you guys hear everything Mark did on that island? Yeah. I was there. Oh, yeah. Sorry. I forget about that. So, what is going on between the two of you? I don't know. Mark: Let's go get some dinner. Woman: I thought you and Megan were involved. Megan's nice, but we're just friends. Really? This may sound awful, but she's a little shallow. I don't know her that well. You should have seen the bag she brought on the plane. That alone was enough to take us down. [ crying ] There you are! - Hi. Hey. Okay, so, this weekend, Vegas. A bunch of us are going. Are you in? Can't. I have Church this Sunday. You're picking Church over Vegas? You are starting to sound like Chris. What's wrong with that? Nothing. It's just a little geeky. Maybe. But thanks for inviting me. Okay. We'll send that right over. Thank you. Hey, Megan. - Mark. I don't have any plans tonight. Want to go out? Thanks, but no. What about tomorrow night? It's not an issue of when. I think I'm a little too shallow for you. What? You have a better offer? Hey, this is Chris. Sorry I'm not around. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. Where is he? - Who? Chris. He's not answering his phone. He said he was going to relax a bit, clear his head or whatever. Hey, this is Chris. Sorry I'm not around. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. Hi. It's Megan. I heard you were out of town, and I wanted to see you and talk. Give me a call back whenever. Yeah. Bye. Hey, Megan. - Hi. Did you find Chris? Sort of. He's at his sister's. In Hawaii? I called him, but he hasn't called me back. Maybe he didn't check his messages. It might be kind of awkward over the phone anyway. Why? Well, he told me -- I said that -- It's a long story. One of those, huh? Yeah. It'd be better face-to-face. Then go see him. I don't know that he'd want that. Well, there's only one way to find out. I don't know. Look, if it's important to you, isn't it worth it? Yeah, a window seat's fine. Are you sure there's not anything else leaving today? Two hours? No, no. I can make that. [ car door closes ] Hi. Hi. I don't know if this is the right place or not. I'm looking for Chris. Are you his sister? You must be Megan. Yeah. He went down to the beach. Thanks. You didn't get enough of the beach? I figured you'd come here. I called around, trying to find your sister's address. I called the Bishop to get your parents' number. That was after the Elder's Quorum President and the Relief Society President and, well, you get the idea. Your parents were suspicious about a random girl calling. They finally told me where you were, and I got a flight here. How'd you know I'd go to my sister's place? You said you come here to clear your head. So, quit your job. It was time. I was thinking of quitting, too. Why? It might be awkward, working with Mark. I liked who he pretended to be. I kept convincing myself that's what I wanted. I finally realized you were right about Mark and also about me. I was changing who I should be just to try and please everyone. You made me realize that, even if I didn't want to. You're a better influence in my life than Mark or anyone could be. I only regret... Well, I have two regrets. What? One, I was doing all the wrong things. I might have opened your eyes to the Gospel, but you opened mine in how to live it. And two, that I might have missed my chance to be with you. You only have one regret. So...what's next? How about dinner? I know this great sushi place. No! I've had as much fish as I can stand. Come on. I'll take the seaweed off for you.
