Just pay your rent, or I'll burn your shop down. MAN LAUGHING What's so funny? Rent's no laughing matter, fairy! Serves you right, you're a coolie! Months overdue and not even a "good morning." You'll be a coolie for life. There you go, handsome! What took you so long with the congee? I stopped to help an old lady cross the street. What are you doing here? Checking for Peeping Toms. Was someone just spying on you, Auntie Six? Don't shoot your mouth off without proof. She's crazy. CHICKEN CLUCKING THUMPING LANDLORD GRUNTING CHATTERING Go away! ### CHILDREN CHATTERING CHILD: Please can you teach us, sir? No more soccer! CRYING Who wants the cut? My boss. Take a seat. SCISSORS SNIPPING Done! Fifty cents, please. Isn't it great? It's too good! Why'd you make him look so good? Why? Don't get mad, boss. He's my old buddy. I'll handle this. He's boss of the Axe Gang. Don't you see the two axes? We're bad guys. Making him look good is really bad. Understand? I didn't know. You're a numskull! But I like you, so just pay me, and I'll take care of it. No way! Steady with the axe, boss. Let me talk to him. I really care for you. You saw it for yourself. Seriously. Why don't you pay up. Not much. Enough for a drink. Oh, so it's blackmail! Boss! Boss! SNORING Now you're dead! Looks like he's waking up! I'm not afraid. You can kill me. But there'll be thousands more of me! You want to play tough? The Axe Gang boss is napping in there. Whoever wants to die, step forward. So you want to fight? Great! We'll go one-on-one. Don't even think about cheating. That old woman with the onion! You look real tough. Want to try me? I'll let you hit me first. What do you do? I'm a farmer. Farmers don't fight. Piss off! He's crazy! Calling me names? You're lucky you're a woman. Hey, shorty! Yeah, you! If you're short, you don't retort. What did I say about cheating? Sit back down! You! The geezer with the glasses. You look mean. No, not you. I mean... You! Hey, kid, let's rumble!

LANDLAD Y: Boss, my ass! You have to pay our medical bills! Bills, my ass! We're on the same side! Same side, my ass! LANDLAD Y GRUNTS Think you're so tough? I'll call for backup! You nitwit! Let's see you call backup! You don't know the backup I have. I'm talking an army here. EXPLOSION Don't you go away! Go put a down payment on your coffin! ### Who threw the firecracker?

Get rid of him! We're the bad guys! We're meant to do the ass-kicking... not the other way around. And it's all because these morons posed as Axes. Don't waste your time, Brother Sum. We'll handle this. You! Take care of it. ### Boy, can this guy pick locks. It's a living. Give me a break. Pick that one too, if you're so good. Come. I'll count to three. Hurry! Ready? Three! BROTHER SUM: That's quick! Brother Sum, we really want to be Axes. That's why we did what we did. Give us a chance. Ever killed anyone? I've always thought about it. Then go kill someone. I will! Go on! Thank you, Brother Sum. We can always find a use for that type. ### SING: I told you before, you've got to look tough. Tougher! SING'S SIDEKICK GROWLS Tougher! GROWLING Act the part. And try to stay awake. It's tiring being tough. Tiring? It's our living! SING: The streets out there are filled with money and women. You only need the will and determination to seize the opportunity to win. This is our big chance! We just kill someone, and we're in the gang. Then it'll be money and women all the way! Don't be like those beggars with no ambition. ### Who are you looking at, four-eyes? I'll smash your glasses! Get lost! Come here and say that! You're really gonna kill someone? That's right! The four-eyes, the fat woman and all the residents of Pig Sty. But they're good at kung fu. I can do kung fu! Oh, yeah? SNICKERS Didn't I tell you I know Buddhist Palm kung fu? MAN: Hey there, handsome boy. Stop. Amazing! Do you know you have a special aura? You're so young, but you have the bone structure and chi flow of a kung-fu genius. If your chi flow can be channelled, then you will be invincible! Like the old saying: You cannot escape your destiny. The duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours. Sure. This is the scroll of the Buddhist Palm. It's priceless. But as it's fate, I'll let you have it for $10. ### BUDDHIST PALM MANU AL You gave him your life savings? Yes. I was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer, but this was world peace. CHATTERING SING: Let go of the girl! Hey! It's the Buddhist Palm! "The 20-Cent Kung Fu Manual." CHILDREN LAUGHING You must be loaded. Have you killed anyone lately? He's a fool, and she's mute. Losers! I realized then that good guys never win. I want to be bad. I want to be the killer! Ice cream! Where? Make mine a vanilla. Chocolate for me! ### What're you looking at? Never seen free ice cream before? Look at her run! LAUGHING You're such kung-fu masters, go take it on the road. You belong in the circus, not here! Don't say that, Landlady. There must be a reason they're here. Everyone has his reasons. We don't want to make trouble. I'm glad you get it. The mob's mad at us. We'll never hear the end of it. Why don't you get lost! Your wife shouldn't be so nasty. MOANS You okay? WOMAN: Masters. We have nothing precious to give you, but take this as a token of our appreciation. Thanks for saving us! LANDLAD Y: Stop the crying. This isn't a show! You're so cold-hearted. Talking back to me, eh? You may know kung fu, but you're still a fairy. CRYING It's no crime to be good at kung fu! Once a fairy, always a fairy. Look at you. What's with the red underwear? Why not a diaper while you're at it. J ANE: What's wrong with red underwear? Where were you when there was trouble? If it weren't for them, we'd be finished. Be reasonable! I'll reason with you. You owe me three months' rent. That's $90. Pay up or pack up! Don't you worry. I'll pay it. Think you're a smartass, Rabbit-Tooth Jane? What's it to you, tub of lard? Bitch! Calm down, Landlady. This is your fault. PEOPLE SHOUTING MAN 1: Are you trying to kill us? MAN 2: You're right. MAN 3: How could you do that? Shut the hell up! HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING GLASS SHATTERS You think you can out-yell me? The fat lady can really sing. Watch this! ### What happened? What do you mean, what happened? You try it. Me? Quick! Sorry! You okay? I think you should get closer and take better aim. Okay? Okay! Who's throwing the handles? Handle? Where's the third knife? God knows where it went. Could it be the same one? Can't be... Don't! Sorry. What are you trying to say? I just remembered I have something to do. See you! Uh-oh. They've seen us! Stay back! Don't panic! Snakes like music. If I whistle, they won't bite. Please, no more bright ideas. HISSING Oh, what the hell! WHISTLES GASPS Not you again, asshole! MAN: Get back to your business! Split up! Split? ### WHIRRING HORN HONKING THUD ### TYRES SCREECHING WOMEN SCREAM POUNDING What're you doing here? Looking for you. Weren't you hurt? I'm fine! How come you always recover so fast? I don't know. Which hospital did you go to? Don't remember. Maybe it's better that way. Memories can be painful. To forget may be a blessing! I never knew you were so deep. All the sadness one can bear... down the river everywhere. Hey, get out of the way! SING'S SIDEKICK: Move! SING: I'll slap you to kingdom come! Look at those four-eyes carting around a coffin. What morons! LANDLAD Y: Don't blame me for making you leave. We'll let Buddha decide BELL TOLLING whether you stay or go. HORRIFICALLY BAD FATE Have some tea. We're grateful for some professional help. We understand the problem. Twelve Kicks from the Tam School, Iron Fist from the Hung School and the Hexagon Staff... Those guys at Pig Sty are really good. HARPIST 2: Their warrior days are long over, but they're still top fighters. This job is a great challenge for us. Now, that's professionalism. Number One Killers. Expensive, yes, but worth every penny! No! Number one is the Beast, the world's top killer. HARPIST 2: He was so dedicated to kung fu, he went crazy. I heard he's now in an asylum. So you're the top killers now. Strictly speaking, we're just musicians. A song that wrenches the heart O where do I find a knowing ear? Great poem, isn't it? ### We'll be saying goodbye soon. Who knows when we'll see each other again. We're three of a kind. Wish we'd known before. Let's take this opportunity to spar a little. No. We still have a lot to pack. You're right. ### Twelve Kicks of the Tam School! Superb attack and defence! Iron Fist: powerful yet delicate. Top-notch! Hexagon Staff, with its thousand moves. Mystical! ALL: Till we meet again! SHOUTS CLATTERING & CAT SCREECHING MUSIC PLAYING ON RECORD PLAYER LANDLAD Y: More lipstick! INDISTINCT CHATTERING Stay there, or I'll break you in half. ### ### JINGLE ### Sorry, we're closed. You can make a suit in no time. We're moving. This is good material! You know your stuff. This has high artistic value. How high? At least a few stories... ### Insulting the Axe Gang! We'll show them. Let's kill them all and make this place a brothel. Don't block my view! What's going on? GRUNTING Good! Good! Don't block my view! Damn! I told those nitwits to leave, but they're still here. Really? Yeah. What the hell is this fighting? Who'll pay for the damage? Sorry, sorry. It's nothing! COUGHS You know what time it is? I have to sleep. Hey, fatso, eat shit and die! Die? In this racket? Sorry, sorry! LAUGHS Get out of my way! Hang in there, Tailor. LANDLAD Y: Be quiet! HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING LANDLAD Y: Give us a break! Why push us so far? There's another master? ### GRUNTING GROANING SCREAMING GRUNTING It's the Lion's Roar! I thought that was a myth. Who knew the Lion's Roar really exists? That's the last we'll see of them. It's bad, Brother Sum. Quick, start the car! Start the car! Boss! Keep it down! Have you no manners? Get lost. People are trying to sleep. They have to work tomorrow. Get out of here! Scumbags! ### WOMEN SOBBING DONUT: I can't hang on much longer. But having seen real masters like you... I can now die in peace. Don't say that. We're ordinary folks. Ordinary's a blessing. Don't call us masters. But you're such great fighters! If only you'd helped earlier, they wouldn't have to die this way. Like Donut said, everyone has his reasons. Years ago... we saw our only son killed in a fight. Revenge can be devastating. Do you understand? Why don't you train us to be top fighters and we'll avenge them! Becoming a top fighter takes time. Unless you're a natural-born kung-fu genius. And they're one in a million. GRUNTS It's obvious I'm the one! Don't think so. Everyone! We swore we'd never fight again. But we broke that promise today. For your own safety, please all leave! In great power lies great responsibility. There's no escaping from it. Donut, you're hurt bad. Rest now. BABBLING We can't understand what you're saying. Donut! ### I know you, four-eyes! You seem prejudiced against the sight-challenged. That's right. Especially gold-framed four-eyes. GRUNTING HISSING Gold frames are perfect for clerks. I think I look good. So why keep picking on me? Help me! GROWLING "Help me! Help me!" Want to play, punks? The Dragon Style? The Tiger Style? Come down here, and I'll smash your glasses. Come on! You know I'd do it, right? Swear to it! Swear! Have you no respect? Where were you when I needed you? BARKS You sound like a wimp! We always get beat! We haven't gotten anywhere. No killing, no arson, no robberies, no rapes... all because of you! You're a numb-nut! Follow me! It's a stickup! Where's the money? Where's the money? What're you looking at? I'm serious! I kill people for less! Give me the money. ### The money's in here. SING AS A CHILD: Let go of the girl! He's a fool, and she's mute. Losers! Go away! You're dragging me down! Go home and raise pigs. Go, before I kill you. BAND PLAYING MUSIC MAN: You! Whatsyourname! Take this and get some new clothes. You're now an Axe! For real? Someone's waiting for you. Brother Sum! One look at you, and I knew you'd do anything. Right! You just needed your chance. Damn right! We have an assignment for you. Anything, Brother Sum! ### SING: "Research on abnormal people." What's that? A mental asylum. ALARM BUZZING Soldiers! Boy Scouts! SING: Tanks! ADVISOR: No worries. When the Boy Scouts change shifts, you have exactly five minutes. Follow the arrows on the map. Go to the last cell and get the man inside there out. Here's your tools. What about you guys? We're your lookouts. WIND WHISTLING THUNDER RUMBLING Five minutes. Hurry! ### GASPS GRUNTS LOCK CLICKS ### BROTHER SUM YAWNS The world's top killer indeed looks the part! It's only a title. Cut the bullshit. We want two people killed. Name your price. Name my what? I've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary. So far, I've never found one. That's why I stayed inside. Had I met my match, I'd have been out long ago. If you find me a worthy opponent... I'll do it for free. No charge! LAUGHING Do you have someone? Yes. Brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge. But first, will you show us some moves? Not that we don't trust you. We want to see you in action. You numskulls aren't worthy! SNAPS FINGERS He doesn't look the part. The slippers are a little crappy. But he'll clean up well. You sure you got the right guy? Absolutely. I swear I did exactly what you told me. Please show us some moves, Mr. Beast. Don't make it hard for me! You dumb or what? You know what this is, old man? Ever seen a fist this big? Don't force me to fight. I scare myself when I fight! Really? Try me, then. Is he okay? LAUGHING So you say you can fight? Harder! GLASSES SHATTER Harder! Harder! You hit like that and call yourself a gangster? A foreign gun! GUNS COCKING GUNSHO ### In the world of kung fu, speed defines the winner. The Beast is the best of them all. The Axe Gang extends its respect! SCREAMING The real masters, together in one room! Only the world's top killer has such an aura. BEAST: Likewise. Could you two be the fated lovers...? Paris... And Helen of Troy! A pleasure, indeed. We're here to deal with the Axe Gang... and only the Axe Gang. BROTHER SUM LAUGHING You should've killed me before. Now you're committing suicide. You're living on borrowed time. You can't escape your fate! What's this? A funeral bell? SNICKERS With the Beast here, let's see whose funeral it is! LANDLAD Y: So you're on their side? Don't get me wrong. I only want to kill you... or be killed by you. LAUGHS What do you think? The good cannot coexist with the bad. You can't escape your destiny. So be it. Let's do it. Okay. Let's do it! ### Piece of cake. I can handle this. BEAST CHUCKLING Good try, but a little off target. LAUGHING ### HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING The Lion's Roar? GRUNTING & COUGHING CHIMING HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING GLASS SHATTERING SCREAMS BEAST: Wait! I didn't know the Lion's Roar could be done with a speaker! What a blow! GRUNTING Looks like they're not up to it! Let's get them while they're down. You do it! I'm gonna puke! I need to see a doctor! Go to hell! You! Come over here. Hit him! Yes! The head! Of course! Hit him on the head! Okay. Here's your chance. Got it! Hit him! Hit him! Hit the shit out of him! Right! Hit him! Hit him! Beat the shit out of him! What're you doing? You want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him? You're making me very confused! SCREAMING ### Wow, that's a big fist! Why did you hit me? Where are they? How could you let them escape? GASPING No one gets away from me! ### Why did he save us? Young people make mistakes. But at least he finally made good. Look at him! Beaten to a pulp. Do you have any last requests? Hey, wait! Why don't you write in Chinese? I don't understand. ### There's no one here! CHINESE MEDICINE It's a miracle he lasted this long. The herbs should help him. Herbal medicine can only partly help. The key is his own body structure. All his bones and tendons are broken. It's amazing he's recovering so fast. It can't be possible... Unless he's... ### BANDAGES SNAPPING What's that smell? ALL SCREAMING ### SING: You mustn't smoke while you're hurt. Let me handle this. This makes no sense. Who knew the Beast could clear the chi flow and thus unleash the boy's true potential? We should've guessed. He is the one! ### Is this for real? You're still alive, you turncoat? Kill him, men! What kind of move is that? Kids' stuff! ### If our son were alive, he'd be his age now. If he studies hard, he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer. A stuntman, more likely! DINGING THUNDER RUMBLING Not bad. Let's go. I can even stop bullets... CROAKS GRUNTS LAUGHING CROAKING What? The Toad Style of the Kwan Lun School? Oh, no! SCREAMING BIRD SCREECHES Remember the Palm move that falls from heaven? That's the long lost Buddhist Palm. ### SCREAMS I surrender! What kind of move was that? If you want to learn, I'll teach you. CRYING Master! ### Hey! Tell him not to put snot on the glass. You two, put your pants on! No licking if you're not buying! ### Kid, you have the bone structure of a kung-fu genius. World peace is in your hands. Here's the scroll of the Buddhist Palm. Because it's fate, I'll let you have it for $10. Wait! You want more...? ###
