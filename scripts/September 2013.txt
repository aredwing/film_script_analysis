Goodnight. Manu, what is it? I have to get up early. Sleep! What do you want, Manu? You want us to go to the beach? Summer is near. You thought it'd never come? Do you want to go for a swim?

Let's go for a walk! - What's wrong with him? - The dog has cardiomyopathy. - He'll have to stay the night. - Is it serious? Speak to the vet tomorrow. Don't worry, we'll call if anything happens. - Can I see him? - You'd better come in the morning. Bye. Manu is dead. Everything will be all right. You'll see. Maria, are you there? If you're there, pick up. Pick up. Manu is dead. Hello, Manu. Can we sleep here? You've got your own room. Go back to your room, your papa is tired, he wants to sleep. I don't want to go back there. There is a dead dog in the house. Back to bed. There is no dead dog. There is, I saw it, ask Mama. It's not inside the house, it's buried in the garden, we're just putting him up. Sophia, what are they talking about? Is there a dead dog in the house? What's the matter? It's in the garden. I can't sleep. Come on, go to sleep. I thought you're a man. - Aren't you all stiff? - My back, a little. Go home. I can't. Can't you go somewhere for a few days? - A change would do you good. - I haven't thought about it. I thought he would want me near him. You talk as if he were a person. - You never had a dog? - No. I never had one. But I can understand what it feels like. No you can't. But thank you. Sophia, tell me it's not true. It is true. You let a stranger bury her dog in my garden? - Yes. - What were you thinking of? Whatever I was thinking, I don't regret it. I don't like dead things on my property. Come on, let's make some salad. All right, let's wash this. - Can I take one? - Take what? Put on an apron. Give me the apron! - I won't put it on. - You won't? Why? - I'm taking one. - Yes. - All right, let's see. - Can I take one too? - Let's wash the lettuce. - I don't care. - Wait! - Can I eat it? - Yes, but it's not washed. - Doesn't matter. I want it when it's washed. Let me put this or it'll burn. Perfect. - Can I put salt? - We put salt already. I want a bit more on my hand. On the hand? Later. Okay? Let's see. - How is it? How is it? - Good. Good? One more time, the chicken needs more. One more turn. Well done. Perfect. Now stir it, to mix the salt in. Hello. - What are you doing here? - I brought you a gift. - Hello Anna. - Hi. Come in. Let's go watch TV. What is it? Let me do it. - Let's have a look. - It's nice. - You like it? - Stephanos! - Shall I turn it on? - Sure. It gives a nice light. Maybe it's better to... put it over there. And this would look better over here. Maybe you're right. You're right, it looks good. I'll make some food. Have you eaten? - No. You need a hand? - It's fine. Stay with Stathis and the kids. - Shall we play hide and seek? - Yes! - Who's going to seek? - Me. 1, 2, -, 4 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I'll get you. I'm coming to get you. - Where is Anna? - I don't know. Quiet, kids! - We can't find her. - Mama, Papa, we can't find her. - Who, Anna? - Yes. Did you look properly? - How did she fit under there? - Who cares? She's not right in the head. - Her dog died, put yourself in her place. - She's not the first. Did your cousin behave like that when Skippy died? - My cousin has two kids. - What do we have to do with it? Come on, let's go. - I'll take her home. - Let her be. - Will you be all right? - Yes, thank you. - Is that where you live? - Yes. - By yourself? Yes. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Open up, I need to get off. - I'm not allowed to, only at the bus stop. - Now listen you, just open up! - Sophia. - Anna? - I saw you from afar. - Where are you going? - I was going home, you? - I wanted to get a few things. - Shall I come with you? - Let's go this way. It looks nice. Since having had kids, I never buy anything for myself, without buying something for them. Why don't you try it on? Here. It looks great on you, take it. You'll get soaked. Where is it? - Who are you calling? - Stathis, to come and get us. I like the rain. There he is. Come on. Let's go. What did you buy this time? One of the bags is mine, the other one is Anna's. Hi. You left the kids alone? - Nothing can happen, they're watching TV. The washing, did you bring it inside? - I did. - Great. Stathis. Sophia, please. We had two car accidents last night. I didn't sleep a wink. I'm sorry. Cuddle up. Did you hear that? Stathis, did you hear that? I didn't hear anything. There was a noise from somewhere. It's you who's making the noise. Stathis. I'm scared. - I can jump higher. - Sure. What are you on about? - See? - No, I'm blind. Look again. Did you see? You're doing my head in. Nelly, stop it now! Stop. You'll wake him up. That's impossible. He's dead. He's not dead. He's sleeping. - Nelly. - I'm trying to take it away from her. Nelly. Play with something else! I'm going to dig him out and throw him in the garbage. You hear? I'm talking to you! Why are you so obsessed? - It's bad luck. Don't you get it? - Since when were you superstitious? What do you think? If you'd seen her with her dead dog, you'd have done the same. A dog died, that's all. A dog. You should see what I see in hospital every day. Probably it's made you immune to pain. Hello Anna. Hello Darling, sorry to hear about Manu. Don't give up. You were always strong. See it as a chance to make a new start. We're thinking of coming in summer. Do you still have mother's car? Kisses. "Milk, bread, cheese, tomatoes, pasta, apples, carrots, peppers. Tell Maria, there is food in the fridge. We love you dearly, Mama and Papa. " Sophia, wake up! Wake up! Are you getting up? Come on. Do I have to? You have to take the kids to school. - Will you take them? - No, I have no time. - Please. - Not today, love. Stephanos, Nelly, wake up! Come on kids, wake up! Wake up, kids. Stathis, go get them up. Sophia, I'm in a hurry. Move it kids! Great. - What's that? - I don't know. What is it? Stephanos.

" Here is your milk. Nelly, Stephanos, I'll put it here. Sophia? What is it? - The kids found it under the door. - Who is it from? Guess! Yes? Yes. Hello, Maria! Yes, now I hear you, everything okay? No, no, I am cooking, I am expecting friends. I know. I'm better. I'll call you. I have to go now, okay? Okay bye, bye. - Hello. - Hi. - Happy Birthday. - Thank you. - Nelly, give her the present. - You shouldn't have.

Happy Birthday. - Where does she live? - In Albany, New York. - Have you ever been to see her? - No, I don't have the money. - Why don't you get another dog? - What's that? Nothing. Mama, we're the only guests. - Don't you have other friends? - They couldn't make it tonight. - Don't you have other friends? - They couldn't make it tonight. No, don't put it down yet. Open your gift. - I'm hungry. - It's coming. Hold this. - I didn't have a tablecloth. - Do you like it? Thank you, I really like it. - Thank you, kids. - You're welcome. - I should have taken a smaller one. - Doesn't matter. It's too big. You put out the candle. - By accident. - It's okay. - I'll do it. - Anna, do you mind? No, we'll light it. First you have to put the knife. Anna, why did you bury your dog at our house? Because he is happy there. - How old are you? - 2. You look younger. - About 29. - 16. - No, about 5. - No, 2. It's the first time I have people over. Really? - Happy Birthday. - Happy Birthday. Thank you. I like your place, it's small but cosy. And I like yours. Where is the cake? I forgot. You forgot your birthday? It's not your birthday, right? It is my birthday. It's my birthday. - Name day? - It's her birthday. - It's my birthday, I'll get ice cream. - No need. - Strawberry. - Yes, and... You don't have to. - Strawberry and vanilla. - You don't have to. - Come on, go, go. - Good. I don't have small plates, let's just share. - I have an idea, we'll put this here. - It's mine. - Imagine this is the cake. - Wow! - Chocolate. - Can I blow it out? - No. Anna should. May you live, dear Anna For many years to come May you grow old and your hair turn white May you spread everywhere the light of knowledge So everyone will say: What a wise woman she is. - Did you make a wish? - No, I didn't. I'll make one now. Don't. They never come true. Or do they? I want to watch TV. Where is the TV? - The remote is on the table. - Thank you. - We have to get going. - Already? It's late. Don't you want to stay over? I'll put a mattress down. Another time. We're going, come on. It's time to turn off the TV. All right then. Let's go! Come on, kids. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. It was very nice. - Yes? - Sophia, it's me Anna. What is it? Everything all right? I took out the garbage and locked myself out. I thought you might still be awake. Quick, back to bed. It's late. You want to stay here tonight? We call the locksmith in the morning. - You really mean it? - Why not? - I woke you up. - I wasn't sleeping. When Stathis is away, I have problems sleeping. But you have the kids. Yes I have the kids. - Shall I help you? - No, I can do it. Anna, turn on the light. Why aren't you sleeping? I don't like sleeping in the dark. Me neither. What's America like? I haven't been, but it's big. Bigger than Athens? - Bigger. - Bigger than Greece? Even bigger. No way! Anna, what do kids do in America? They're sad like everywhere in the world. Like you. My mama is also sad sometimes. They need to sleep. - I'm sorry. Who is wearing socks? - Nobody. No. We don't wear them to bed? - I do. Foot! One... Take Nelly's as well. - Nelly's! The other one, quick! Foot! Every day you take them from me. - Quick! - No! And the other one. Goodnight. You're not asleep? - I'm not sleepy. I'm tired, go to sleep. Sophia, I just couldn't sleep alone. This can't go on, maybe you should do something about it. I like it here. Goodnight. Goodnight. Anna, wake up! You have to go. When Stathis comes home he'll be tired. Can I use the bathroom? - Yes, of course. Bye. I love sleeping next to you and telling you sweet nothings. Just a second, the cell, it's work, give me two minutes. Yes? Hello. You avoided me. - I didn't see you. You know I am working here, why didn't you look for me? Okay. Just a sec. Yes. I'll help you. Do you work here? - Yes, I just finished. Shall we go? Are you going home? - Yes, you need something? Can I come? I don't have my car. - Yes, sure. ...high in the sky You are like the beat of my heart You have cut off my wings Come and take my sorrow from me Come and give me back the joy You have a horrible voice. Stathis! I don't. Do I? His is worse. That's why I don't sing. Stathis, be careful. Slow down a bit. You're going very fast. Speed makes me nauseous. Stathis! Stathis, take it easy! - Don't tell me what to do. We need a holiday. You could take time off to go somewhere. It's not possible. They need me at work. I need you, too. And the loan? How will the loan get paid? Just for a couple of days. I don't feel well. Pull over for a minute. She's weird. Don't you see it? - Cut it out. I don't like her. I don't want her in my car. It's also my car. We bought it together. Remember? You can't stand loneliness, not even in the back seat. "The most wonderful voice I've ever heard. " Katherina says: "Those people with their great voices revive the likes of Manos Xidus. " I'm reading from E-mails we received. What's wrong now? What happened? The car won't start, I'm late. - Take the bus. They're on strike. - Why don't you take a cab? 50 euros? Why don't you lend me yours? Please. Here. Bring it back after work. What time do you finish? Around three. Leave a bit earlier, so I can pick up the kids, okay? If you want I can go and get them, it's on my way home. - Don't worry, I'll go and get them. You're sure? Yes. Thank you. Papa never gives his car to strangers. - He gave it to me. Why didn't Mama come? - Mama had work to do. Will you take us home? Yes, but first a ride or ice cream? - A ride! - Ice cream! What is that thing that they call love? What is it? What is it? What is that thing, that gives you wings And at the same time sorrow and delight What is that thing that they call love? What is it? What is it... that makes you feel like singing this tune? I love you I love you I love you What is that thing that they call love? What is it? What is it? That makes hearts fly high And whoever has felt it misses it Why don't you ever listen? Ever! It's always about what you want! Damn the moment you buried this dog here. She's a lonely woman. You feel threatened? By what? You understand nothing. Nothing! Absolutely nothing! You're never home. Where are the kids? Where are the kids? Nelly, Stephanos, get inside! Now! I called and called! Why don't you pick up? I took them to the beach, I told you I'd pick them up. Listen here, Anna. Don't ever come back, understood? I swear I'll hurt you. Never again! Finished. That's it. Understand? Get lost! Get lost! Inside! "You have a horrible voice. " "You have a horrible voice. " "Don't you have other friends?" "Are you asleep?" "Are you asleep?" "Take me in your arms. " "Why don't you get another dog?" "It's not your birthday, is it?" "Put the knife down Stephanos!" "Put the knife down Stephanos!" "Shall we put some salt?" "Shall we put some salt?" "Who will cut the lettuce?" "Who will cut the lettuce?" "Since having had kids, I never buy anything for myself, without buying something for them. " "Anna, turn on the light. " "I can't sleep in the dark. " "I'm afraid. " "I'm afraid too, Nelly. " Excuse me? Could I sit next to you? I get dizzy in the aisle. All right. - Thank you. Thank you. You know where else I get dizzy? On the train. I can't stand the train. Are you going far? - To Salamina. How nice! Me too, we'll be on the same ferry. Work? Holidays. This time of year? A bit early, no? I want to see the sea. Have you been before? No, never. - I go a lot. It's better you're going now, because later it gets awfully crowded. Kids, dogs, babies, families. I can't stand babies. - Really? Yes, it's full of them in the summer. Nice weather, isn't it? Summer. - That's a bit hasty. Not yet. Well, "like summer", then. Will you take a dip as well? - Yes. Me, I can't stand the water. 1, 2, -, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I was first. Would you like to count? 1, 2, -, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Niko. Come here. Come here, Stella! What did you do to my orangeade?
