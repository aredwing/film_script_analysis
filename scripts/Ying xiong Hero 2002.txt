We rejoice for our King! This warrior sent from Heaven has exterminated the assassins Summon the warrior! Remain 100 paces from His Majesty Or you will be executed. Never forget that No one is allowed within 1 00 paces of me Do you know why? To guard against assassins Yes. That's why I am confined in this armor You have removed a great peril for me How should I reward you? My service was for Qin, not for a reward Achievements must be rewarded Sky's silver spear... wounded many of my brave warriors Announce my edict! By order of His Majesty he who kills Sky will receive gold and land and be allowed to drink within 20 paces of His Majesty I am informed you're a citizen of Qin I am a Prefect from Leng Meng County A County Prefect over 1 0 square miles! Surely the lowest-ranking official in Qin How did you defeat such opponents? I took them on one by one Tell me the details Does Your Majesty know Flying Snow and Broken Sword were lovers? Yes, I do And that they hadn't spoken for three years? For three years? Why? Flying Snow had an affair with Sky Broken Sword never forgave her Why haven't I heard this before? I went to great lengths to uncover it To divide Flying Snow and Broken Sword I first needed to eliminate Sky I have an idea of what you planned Your Majesty is wise What did you use to defeat Sky? The sword I must arrest criminals in my county On the fifth day of the sixth month Sky attended a chess house I had learnt he enjoyed playing chess and listening to music there So, the seven masters of Qin Palace We are here to arrest you! Identify yourself by showing your spear Halt! What can a minor official do? This is my territory So? You are on the King's most wanted list I am placing you under arrest Old man, please play one more tune Martial arts and music are different but they share the same principle Both stress attaining a supreme state Sky and I faced each other for a long time Neither of us moved We fought the battle in our minds How swift thy sword! I thought I knew everything about my Kingdom I didn't know that Leng Meng County held a talent like yours Broken Sword Flying Snow By order of His Majesty! Flying Snow and Broken Sword have teamed up for assassination He who kills either of them will receive gold and land and be allowed to drink within 10 paces of His Majesty Three years ago, Flying Snow stormed the palace with Broken Sword I've since emptied the palace so assassins cannot hide Was your sword swifter than theirs combined? No How did you do it, then? Disguised as a citizen of Zhao I sought them in the Kingdom of Zhao I learned they were hiding in a calligraphy school under the names Highcliff and Springbrook Rumor had it the Qin army would attack that day Most of the townspeople had fled Only the school's students remained Why have you come at such a time? Who are you? I'm from Yi County in the Kingdom of Zhao My father's dying wish was for one of your scrolls I fear this may be our school's last day Which calligrapher do you seek? I respectfully request Master Highcliff Highcliff was Broken Sword Legend said his skill as a swordsman was rooted in his calligraphy So I had my concerns I needed to find out if it was true What do you want written? "Sword." You are fond of the sword? It was my father's dying wish What size scroll? Eight feet For that size I will need red ink My master has asked me to borrow some red ink My master wants to borrow some red ink Did you hear me, Master Springbrook? Master Highcliff wants to borrow red ink Tell him to come himself Could I have some red ink? The character "sword" was still being written when Your Majesty's troops arrived at the city gates Draw! Your Majesty's army is invincible not only because it is brave but also because of its archery with a greater range than any other army The Qin archers are like artillery intimidating the enemy Hail! Hail! Hail! Please remember their arrows might destroy our town and topple our Kingdom but they can never obliterate our culture Today you will learn the essence of our culture Hail! Hail! Hail! Those Zhao people didn't flee? They drew strength from their calligraphy What was so difficult about "sword"? There are 19 different ways to write it I asked Broken Sword for a 20th way Both calligraphy and swordplay rely on one's strength and spirit The 20th style would reveal the essence of his swordsmanship How odd to write it in 1 9 ways It makes the written language impossible to comprehend Once I've conquered the six Kingdoms and all the northern tribes I will eradicate this problem by mandating one style of writing Wouldn't that be ideal? Your Majesty won't stop at the six Kingdoms? The six Kingdoms are nothing! I will lead my army to conquer vast lands and establish a great empire Hail! Hail! Hail! Master Springbrook Why are you going outside? To fend off the arrows You aren't needed. Stay inside The Qin archers are powerful You alone may not stop them Hail! Hail! Hail! You are good You are even better You didn't come here for calligraphy Who are you? I've travelled here to deliver an item Please meet me in the library at midnight Great calligraphy Great swordplay You didn't even see my swordplay I couldn't have written without it At midnight meet me in the library Several hundred thousand Qin troops were readying for the next onslaught I studied the character all night trying to unlock the secret of his skills It would reveal his swordsmanship? But it's just an ordinary word Calligraphy and swordplay are similar One must comprehend their true essence Did you discover it? It eluded me So how did you challenge them? Although they hadn't spoken in three years They spied on each other At midnight Broken Sword would peek into Flying snow's room At 2 o'clock in the morning she would spy on Broken sword What strange behaviour I was surprised too So I used Sky's silver spear to get to them Sky died by your sword? Y es Who are you? Why are you here? I'm from the Kingdom of Qin I have a message from Sky Go on He said he had lived a life without responsibilities or commitments He cared for only one person Who? Flying Snow Sky was certain she'd avenge his death To fight, meet me at the Qin camp You can leave now Go! I know you saw us! Let me tell you we've been together for three years I let you see us on purpose! I no longer care about you at all! We were both very foolish I just wanted you to care about me I'm not going to fight you Go away! I will kill you in honor of my master! You ask to die. I will help you. Why do you laugh? What you did last night was stupid My plan proved successful When Flying Snow was fighting me she was disturbed and disoriented I defeated her easily I never imagined supreme warriors Iike Broken Sword and Flying Snow allowing their emotions to be a liability It sounds as if you did divide them Yes In that case, they must have been petty and narrow-minded True Your story sounds logical But you have underestimated one person. Who? Me Would you like my impression of them? Three years ago they stormed the palace I was impressed by their valor and dignity Their character could not be petty So Flying Snow's affair with Sky is a lie Their betrayal of one another is a lie The story you just told is a lie! Except for one thing Sky did know one of you Who? You I surmise you two were old friends And Sky's defeat has only one explanation What's that? He permitted it To kill me, the two of you formed a pact using my men as witnesses That was not hard to arrange The hardest part was to persuade Sky to put his life in your hands You were not fast enough to defeat Sky He died willingly under your sword Such devotion deserves true respect He was the first to sacrifice himself for your mission Sky was proud He saw himself as an unrivalled fighter What convinced him you could succeed where he had failed? You have trained, perhaps for 10 years with one goal, my assassination You have a great skill that few can counter Killing Sky got you within 20 paces of me So why seek out Broken Sword and Flying Snow? I surmise that your skill requires you to come within 1 0 paces You needed a second sacrifice to claim another reward to bring you within 10 paces Although Broken Sword and Flying Snow had never met Sky they instantly understood the reason for his defeat How far am I from the bookshelves? About 1 0 paces I need one of you to help me Please decide between yourselves Meet me at the Qin camp tomorrow morning How swift thy sword! True Sky was a superior warrior He willingly gave his life to this man He can kill the King We must proceed That means we will die Then we die together You were one step ahead of me Did I hurt you too much? I should be the one who fights him I want you to live If you died, how could I live? You will live on, promise me Say it! All right Moon is on her way I had better go I am Nameless, Prefect of Leng Meng County Please allow me to fight this assassin She is on His Majesty's most wanted list Now she's here, I will arrest her The assassin and I have an agreement to fight one on one Should I be unable to defeat her please apprehend her Your permission is sought Draw your sword! Hail! Hail! Hail! Make your move! Hail! Hail! Hail! I die willingly Make your move Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! How swift thy sword! What are you here for? For what you once said. "l will fight the one who harms Flying snow" Please draw your sword Thank you I believe you and Broken Sword also fought but rather it was A fight to honor Flying Snow. My master wishes you to have his sword Why? He and she are bound in life and death They will never part, nor will their swords It is his dying wish that you take his sword for your mission Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword sacrificed themselves so you can be within 1 0 paces of me All three gave you their lives The best of friends could not give more Therefore you are the most dangerous assassin of all How did you uncover my plan? The flames of these candles are disturbed by your murderous intent All of you are willing to die for a cause I'm ashamed to say I am not that committed Your Majesty has seen through our plan If I had realised this sooner I wouldn't have allowed you so close A citizen of Qin would not do this Who are you? A man of Zhao Your Qin soldiers killed my family I wandered into Qin and was adopted I discovered my real identity and set my heart on this plan You've come to avenge Zhao I see I would like to know if your special skill has a name As Your Majesty guessed there is only one crucial move What is that? "Death within 10 Paces." "Death within 10 Paces." A good name! All my guards are 100 paces away outside the palace You are within 10 paces It would seem that today I am doomed But I sense your hesitation Your Majesty is perceptive However you too have underestimated someone. Who? Broken Sword I needed to prove to them that my sword was fast and accurate Within 1 0 paces my sword strikes with surgical precision If it enters at precise pressure points it will not cause any fatal injury If one of you would take a blow before witnesses, we can fool the King Such a blow is hardly child's play How is Sky now? Fully recovered His trust in your sword was extraordinary The King's security is impenetrable There was no other way His lmperial Guards were useless He should have died three years ago. What went wrong? I abandoned the plan The King must not be killed He said that? Yes Why? I also asked him What did he say? He would not explain that day Broken Sword is the strongest of the three He and I are probably equal in skills What he told me later greatly unsettled me While I'm alive I'll stop you assassinating the King I will help you He let the opportunity go by This time, we must succeed See you tomorrow at the Qin camp Please do me a favor Help me fight Broken Sword! Master! What are you waiting for? Although I had agreed to help her attack from behind is dishonorable so I couldn't draw my sword But we both knew if we did not stop Broken Sword we would never succeed Moon, don't! You're no match for him. Stop I knew this would happen You can't stop me now Even wounded, I will still stop you Then I will kill you! Did I hurt him too much? Your special medicine should heal his wounds in a day Have you delivered it? I tended to the wound myself After the battle, take my sword and follow Nameless to see the King Yes They won't treat a servant harshly If the assassination succeeds wave a red flag on your return If it fails, a yellow one If something happens to you any message will be useless I will smile from Heaven if I see a red flag How is Flying Snow? She is resting She doesn't know I've come You said you'd stop me Please abandon the mission You know I am a man of Zhao So am l Doesn't Qin want to conquer Zhao? Yes Isn't the King the enemy of Zhao? Yes Who are you trying to defend? You call yourself a man of Zhao? Flying Snow has asked me that too When we first met I was living a carefree life I fell in love with her after our first fight She's the daughter of a Zhao general who died in battle against Qin She inherited his sword I knew she would avenge her father I promised to help her Calligraphy and swordplay share the same principles We did calligraphy to inspire our swordplay and to heighten our powers She knew I'd drifted since childhood calling no place home Once we'd killed the King, she said she would take me to her home There'd be no more swordsmen only a man and a woman The essence of calligraphy is from the soul Swordsmanship is the same Both aspire to truth and simplicity Gradually I recognised a greater cause Three years ago we perfected our skills Flying Snow insisted on going ahead Together, we stormed the palace She asked why I had abandoned the mission I told her the King must not be killed That is what calligraphy taught me I didn't kill the King After that she refused to talk to me Please abandon your plan No Was your sword forged in hatred? Yes For 10 years, it has never tired I can't stop now How can I dissuade you? Only by killing me Are you that determined? Yes Allow me to convey my conviction in three words These words express my mind Please consider Moon, give my sword to Master Nameless Flying Snow and I will never part nor will our swords Master Nameless although I am just a humble servant allow me to say a few words I've been with my master since I was eight He taught me martial arts and how to be a decent person Whatever my master does is for a good reason The words he has given you carry a deep meaning This will be the last thing I can do for my master Master Nameless, please take his advice Why did you want to do that? I wanted to follow the example of my master and to persuade you with my life You're still young Life is precious If you must die you should die for a greater cause Be on your way I will remember what should be remembered What were the words he wrote? "All under Heaven." All under Heaven... Broken Sword said "The people have suffered years of warfare "Only the King of Qin can stop the chaos "by uniting all under Heaven." He asked me to abandon the assassination for the greater good of all He said, one person's suffering is nothing compared to the suffering of many The rivalry of Zhao and Qin is trivial compared to the greater cause The person who really understands me is my most feared enemy Alone, I have endured so much criticism So many attempts on my life No one understands my intentions Even my court officials see me as a tyrant But I never imagined that Broken Sword, my arch-enemy would truly understand and appreciate my real motives I would like to know how you mean to kill me without your sword? By capturing yours! This sword has protected me through all my battles Having found a true confidant in Broken Sword if I die, I am content with my life Let "All under Heaven" guide your decision It's just dawned on me! This scroll of Broken Sword's isn't about sword technique but about swordsmanship's ultimate ideal Swordsmanship's first achievement is the unity of man and sword Once this unity is attained even a blade of grass can be a weapon The second achievement is when the sword exists in one's heart when absent from one's hand One can strike an enemy at 1 00 paces even with bare hands Swordsmanship's ultimate achievement is the absence of the sword in both hand and heart The swordsman is at peace with the rest of the world He vows not to kill and to bring peace to mankind Your Majesty, your visions have convinced me that you are committed to the highest ideal of ultimate swordsmanship Therefore I cannot kill you Remember those who gave their lives for the highest ideal: peace. No more killing Nameless went within 10 paces of the King He could not have missed There is only one explanation He must have abandoned the mission What did you say to him? I wrote three words What words? "All under Heaven." That is all you care about! And you I don't believe you How can I convince you? Draw your sword You've misled Nameless You've ruined Sky and the Kingdom of Zhao Draw! When we first met... I had to prove myself to convince you What can I do this time? Just draw your sword! Why didn't you fend off my sword? So that you'd believe me I always wanted to go home with you Sadly, it won't happen now Take good care of yourself Why didn't you defend yourself? Why didn't you defend yourself? Why didn't you? No more drifting, no more roaming I'm taking you home now Our home Your Majesty, permission to execute? Permission to execute? Your Majesty, permission to execute? Permission to execute? He conspired to assassinate Your Majesty Show no mercy! This is the law of Qin! To conquer all under Heaven the law must be enforced Set an example for the world! Execute him! Execute him! Execute him! Execute him! Execute him! Execute him! Execute him! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!
