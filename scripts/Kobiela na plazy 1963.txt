I am here, in the booth My name is Bogumil Kobiela I am a TV and film actor. I'll go out in a moment. - Good afternoon! - How do you do, sir. Good afternoon Thats nothing! I'll go to them, to the beach. We'll see what impression will I make. It's all good. I reckon that one must always keep fit, that's it. Well, it is about keeping your body in a good shape. What should I do? Just lie on sand for hours? I must tell you, sir, it is even little bit shameful. One needs to train body a little. It seems to me that you, ladies and gentlemen, are laughing at me. But this is good that you laugh at me, because I've done this for you to laugh! So when I'll laugh at you in my turn Well, not so much at you, but at all of us here on the beach, I want you not to have any issues with that! Is it a deal? Good! Thank you! And please, laugh at me as much as you want to. - Sorry, what was that? - [not distinct] ... swimming suit Well, no, mister. I have my own ... Well, thank you very much and let's make a deal that we will laugh at each other without any offence taken! Is it a deal? Good afternoon! Do you have a swimmer's license? If you teach a child you must have it. Could you please... - Is it on the shore? Sure? - Yes, yes. - Sure? So I don't have to worry? - You don't have to worry, no. Thank you very much - May I see your swimmer's license please? - But I don't swim! But you are wading. How should I know if you don't go any deeper? No... Sir, up to where is this, what's its name... Limit? Up to here. But everyone who is in the water should have... - Even if I am up to my knees? Well, naturally. There is no guarantee that you don't go any deeper! What if you get a cramp? Ladies and gentlemen, your swimmer's licenses please. We stay here, we don't go far. - So you don't have them at all? - We don't have them on us. - But in general? Do you have them? - Yes. - So they're with your stuff? Ok, I believe you. Everything is all right. Thank you. Swimmers' licenses control. - May I see your license please? - I don't have one. I am allowed to swim in here. How far do you go? - How far? Well, just up till there. - All right. Yous swimmer licenses, please. - Licenses? - Licenses. What language do you speak, Madame? Parlez vous francais? Alors, avez vous de cartes de swim? - No? No. - Vous n'avez pas... Speak you English? Yes, you speak a little. From where are you? Very simphatic. - Argentina. - Argentina? So you speak Spanish, yes? - Yes. - And English? - I also speak English. - Yes. You swim? - Yes, I swim. - Very good? - Can you show me a little? - Yes. - Please, do it. - Oh, you have... C'est ne pas bon, parce que... - C'est ne pas bon I am more suntanned than you, miss. Oh here, young lady. Just a moment! I wanted to see who is more tanned. Mister, please, who is more Well, I guess it is probably you, sir. - Well, how is water today? - Perfect! Kobiela on the beach What are you looking for? See! There's a lot of them here! - This is mine. - Ok. Good afternoon! How's the bite? I have been waiting here. Sir, could you give me 3 kg of ... It seems to me that using a net is not fair. It is not fair, one has to give sea creatures some chance. - What chance are you talking about? Well, with a rod there's this unmediated contact of a human being and a fish and there is a struggle, a fish has a chance. While with a net you just catch it like that... You mean it's barbaric? But it goes in this net by itself. Yes, but this isn't the chance I'm talking about, when there's unmediated contact of a human being with a sea creature! Oh, by the way, do you have a kilo of flounder to sell? We're separated here from the fish... Maybe you can sell me something? Oh, good! Thank you! I will take this one in the meantime. This is a beautiful one! Can I buy it from you, sir? Well, sir, I fish for pleasure, as a hobby. But this one is a really big one, as for this beach Last year I caught one that was this big. That was the biggest one, and this one is the second biggest that I've ever caught. Here, just a moment ago. Over there. A little bit further, see those people? They come close here, the big flounders. Well, you know, sir, this is more of a sport, unmediated contact of a human being and a fish. This is not like fishing with a net, when a fish stands no chance! - Sir, where did you catch it? - Dear ladies! There, where those people are, I just went a little bit deeper. One needs a bit of patience and luck and here we have it, right? Kids, what's the deal? Haven't you seen a fish before? Sure, sure. It must have an influence, on hygiene, for instance. Dear sir, you know, the notion of beauty in Ancient Greece, the Olympic Games and all that... The body was beautiful and the spirit had to be beautiful - But sir, it isn't possible to... - Because neither excessive asceticism nor, you know, sir, excessive loosening of the mores... It seems to me that those ancient Greeks were close to that middle ground. Sport, when a person practices, when a person feels the firmness of muscles, a person feels the development, feels that body is overcoming some barriers, physical barriers. It is in a way a kind of a beautiful thing. - Yes, surely, it must create a foundation for good health But to defeat an opponent, thats something different. - It is ugly. - Yes, something ugly. A human being, dear sir, must be loved, not conquered. You know, when a conqueror puts his boot on a defeated person's chest and only then he goes: aaaaaa No, this is ugly... But you see, sir, it seems to me that sport kind of mirrors our situation in life, this fight for existence in the 20th century, you know, sir. I yearn this clean air so much after the stuffy air in Warsaw. - Have you [not distinct] in Warsaw? - Yes, all the time. To breathe in this iodine, you know... But you know, sir, I have to tell you that this air, iodine... It's a hellish place: from there, from above, all the sand is blown this way But you know, sir, somehow ... He made all that dust, that boy did it. Amazing air! Being at sea is good. There's no doubt about it! Don't they film us from there, from that box? Oh, right, they are doing something there, urchins, do you see? Oh no, I am sorry! I didn't know! Let's better hide! Oh, this air is amazing here, near the sea! So much iodine! One senses it! This freshness, this coolness in the lungs! Nice to meet you, nice to meet you I want to ask you a couple of questions. First one, what do you think about this year's season? - All is very good! - So you like this year's season? - Very much! Do you spend time on the beach? What do you think about holidaying on the beach? - I think that holidaying is very good! - Very good too? - Yes, very good! - No. no. I was standing here, in front of this gentleman. - Were you? - Sure! I was standing somewhere here, probably this person left the queue. Ah no, here, in front of this lady! Now I remember! Here! Right? Yes! In front of this lady, yes. Do you know that there is only beer left? They ran out of soft drinks, they have only beer. They ran out of soft drinks. Oh, I just want to have some beer. They ran out of soft drinks, only beer left. Where was this lady? I was queuing behind her, shes probably left. I think I was standing here. Or maybe a little bit closer, somewhere here? I am sorry, was I standing here? This lady... No? So maybe here? Are you sure? There was this lady here and she left the queue. But sometimes... No, it is my aunty who works there, in that booth. If I just wanted I would have got it! I cannot get in... But I was standing somewhere here I left for a second and that lady came back. - You were standing there. - Where? - No, not so close. - I was here. My dear, I was standing here - But I saw you. - Hey, we work here... You know what, they had only beer, no soft drinks! Could I ask you for this as well, I want a perfect disguise for myself. - And the box. -Does it look funny? - Sure! Sir, please, don't worry! I'll bring it back to you! - How many do you have there? - Around 30. - For how much do you sell them? - 2.50 - Thank you! - You're welcome! - Mister, will you wait here? - Yes. - Ice cream! - Mister, I want ice cream! Things are bought and things are sold, you should wait until youre old! - Ice cream! - How much is it? - 2.50 - 0.40, please Can I have 4, mister. Please, 2 for me. Who buys less, gets them first. Ice cream! - Four. - Ice cream! This is too big, I accept only small change. - How much is that? - 0.80 for an ice cream. Ice cream! Ice cream! This one is damaged, it is cheaper. It is damaged - Mister, 4 please. - No, 2 per person. I can't give you more. Ice cream Special absolute ice cream with spirits! Put these life savers here and tangle the oars, please. Meanwhile I will go and find some young girl. I'll act like a clumsy man and we will see what will she do. - Good afternoon, ladies. Do you know how to swim? Excuse me? Yes? Sure? Maybe we could hire a hydrocycle and swim in the sea? What do you say? I am an older man I must tell you, Miss, that it brings... I asked for this one with life savers, just in case It brings this enthralling... Stop! Don't let it get away! It brings this enthralling satisfaction. Physical culture and sport! I've slipped. Horrible. Please excuse me! So awkward Just a minute. How do I shove this off? - Oh, I don't know. - Should we put these on? No, no, put it there. But just in case, you know, Miss It can be dangerous, yesterday there was an accident, some girl fell off this hydrocycle. Maybe you better put this on, just in case. - Why do you laugh, Miss? - Oh, I can't help it. It's not to be worn like that! It's not to be worn now! You're right, it's not comfortable Please, help me, Miss! Why are you laughing, Miss? Do you laugh at an older man? Excuse me. - No, I don't laugh at you. - Is it better now? How do we move away from the shore now? - Well, one needs to sit there. - Who has to sit there? Oh, please excuse me. I will push it! Oh, it is almost impossible... And this water... Oh, it goes now! Miss, please stop this hydrocycle! Stop it! Excuse me, please, excuse me! - Are you making a movie? - No, I want to make some pictures. I look for some beautiful girl. You, Miss, would you agree? Miss, please, come here. Miss, could you please help me in directing this shot? Director's wife... Oh. A serious face, please! - Maybe a little bit closer, closer. - Closer? Closer, here. And now a little bit further. And smile. And now some sad expression. And now freedom, be absolutely free! - And a smile! Imagine sea, stars... - Stars? Attention! Come a little bit closer, closer to this camera. A little bit closer! A tiny bit closer! Attention! And... it's too late And now I have to tell you something, Miss, I haven't taken picture of you but you were filmed on the camera hidden over there. - Oh no... - You see, Miss. Bunia, doggy, where are you? Yes, let's try on this hat I haven't worn hat in my life! Maybe let's cover your eyes a little bit more. Very good. This looks very beautiful. - Well, if only it could stay like that. - And now, move freely. And now take this little dog and go there, to those spheres. Maybe... Well, just act naturally, naturally. He looks so good! He likes it! It will be very good! Very natural! Please, smile! And come a little bit closer! Further! And you, Miss, play with that dog, like this. Attention! Innocent look! Maybe you can quickly hop on this sphere? The most important thing is... No, no, don't make the dog nervous! Calm it down! Miss, don't make it nervous! Up you go on that sphere! Thank you very much. And now a little bit of movement, let go of that oar! Thank you very much! Entertaining... So a little bit... And now some movements. - How should I move? - As if dancing Polonaise. Now please just be natural, I'll try to catch it. Maybe something contemporary? And move towards me! Very good! And now also in this direction. And please, move your legs a little bit. Thank you very much And what about twist? Something contemporary! Hello! I would like to get out! Is there someone? Yes. You sat on me. - Did you get up? - I did. - Because I don't have air here. - I see. Thank you! How do you do? But you shouldn't sit on these baskets, because it damages them. - Really, sir? - Yes, it ruins them. One shouldn't sit on the baskets, because they are meant to be used in this manner: Dear ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to tell you that you can't sit on the baskets! Baskets are damaged because of it, they collapse. And all in all, one should be careful where one sits! Do you now, Sir, I've been watching you and I saw that you're messing up with people all the time. - This is not a circus! - You know, we laugh at each other. - It is not pleasant, not at all! - Not pleasant?
