I will speak with the head Ranger, the Captain that you just met, and we'll go into the files and we'll do our best to give you an answer. Thank you very much. Who was in charge of the Jimmy Davis case - 15 years ago? - That would have been Ranger Jackson, - and he retired about two years ago. - Yeah. He was in charge of the office back then. You know, quite honestly, Sam, I dont- I know about the case, but I don't know much about the details. But I did find the case file. I want you to have it. Good thing is, Ranger Jackson is gonna be here day after tomorrow for the town barbecue. It'd be a really good time for you to sit down with him - and get the details on it. - Sure.

You think, uh... you think your mom would let me move back in? - Of course. - Are you serious? Yeah. She was talking about you. She saying she want me there? Yeah? Why do you think she don't want you there? I don't know. You know your ma. She changes her mind a lot. Well, that's who I got it from. I got all jacked up. - Mr. Briggs, how you doing? - Good to see you, sir. I wanna introduce you to Texas Ranger Samantha Payne. - Hello, sir, nice meeting you. - Yes, ma'am. - My son, Cody. - Cody, good to see you. I'll see you guys in a minute. Thank you. Yeah, I never met a lady Ranger before. I didn't know they had 'em. Yeah, we can vote now as well. That's good. Buster- Buster? Buster Briggs, where you at? I want you to meet a lady Texas Ranger. - Hi, - Hello, sir. Nice handshake. - How are you? - Good, how are you? - Good. You having fun? - Yes, ma'am. - Excellent. - That's her son Cody. Nice to meet you. Maybe I can be a Texas Ranger when I grow up. - You want to? - Yes, sir. I thought you said you wanted to run the ranch with me. Yes, sir, but even if you're 100, I could do both. No, wait a minute. What do you mean you'll do both? I don't know about that. Well, we'll see. Let me think about it. You're not very good at work, son. Go learn to be a cowboy. Go on, get out of here. Cody, go get some... I'll see you in a minute. Oh, God almighty. - Yeah, they're something. - They are. - Listen, let me ask you something. - Yes, sir. - In two weeks, we're gonna have a competitive cook-off. - Okay. - I would like to invite you and your son as my special guests. - Well, I appreciate that. And thank you so much for having us. Very nice party. Thank you, sir. - Ma'am. - Nice meeting you. Look what rolled in. Nice to see you, sheriff. - How are you, Scott? - Good to see you. Good to see you. - Deputy, good to see you. - Good to see you, too. Well, I don't know if Ranger Captain mentioned, I took over the Jimmy Davis case, and the files and notes indicate that the kid maybe, possibly committed suicide. Well, little lady, first thing, I don't think it was suicide. And I said the obvious suspect in this case was Scott Briggs. Maria: And what was the evidence then? Well, his son, the day he sent him off, the young boy disappeared. Then Pedro or whatever the hell his name was- Pedro had looked after the horses- he disappeared. Briggs had a lotto lose in this thing, and I've had that gut feeling for years that everything starts and ends right here. Right here. Now, them two young boys liked to ride horses and have a good time together, and they played- they played a little grab-ass or whatever goes on between them. That's their business. It's none of mine. These were young boys. They're human beings. They deserve the protection of the law. That's the way I feel about it, and that's the way I see it. But I had a couple of beers one time with Scott Briggs, and he told me that all gays were evil. S0 that's something to think about. Well, Sam, you're gonna have to use old-fashioned investigative techniques on this one. Really turn up the heat on this. But remember, don't ever forget the obvious, 'cause those clues will lead you where you need to be. Last night I slept on a whorehouse floor... I 290, 290. Good to see you, sheriff. Enjoy. Enjoy.)'- Thanks for the good work. You got a really good man here. Yeah. Thank you. Hey, kids. Scott? The kid is gone. Those guys came back and took him back to Mexico, and I couldn't do anything about it. You stay up with Buster tonight, okay? - I'll take care of it, okay? - Okay. I'll take care of it, all right? I'll take care of it. Yeah. Yeah. They took the kid back, and now they're trying to smuggle drugs over here. Those dirty sons of bitches. You hear what I'm saying?! Good shot. Good shot. Good shot. Let's get out of here. Terrific. Great. Great. Great. Great. - Mrs. Payne. - Hello, Mrs. Davis. - How are you? - Fine. Thank you. - I would like to show you my son's bedroom. - Sure. Mrs. Davis: His room seems more quiet than the rest of the house. I sometimes- I like to sit down and... think about the good times. Your son seemed to love water and horses. Mrs. Davis: He loved to swim, but the horses were everything to him. How often did he visit the Briggs ranch? I really don't know. What kind of relationship did he have with Ben Briggs? - They were very close. - Mm-hmm. But... some people liked to say it was more than that. Was your son on antidepressant medication? Yes. He was. Did he try to commit suicide prior to his disappearance? Yes. Do you mind if I keep this picture? - Take anything you need. - Thank you very much. OkayOkay. OkayOkay. S0 I'll call you as soon as I learn something. - Thank you very much. You're so kind. - Thank you. Good morning. ls Mr. Briggs in? Good morning: He'll be over in a minute. - How can I help you? - Are you the lady of the house? No, I live with the family. I have for years. I help run things around here. Well, there's a lotto do on a ranch this size. - That's for sure. - Maria, can I talk to you? How you doing today? Good? Good morning, sir. - My granddaughter Maddie. - How are you? She can ride a horse, let me tell you. Okay, go tell your brother, I need him here to do some work for one time, okay, for once. Kind of early, aren't you? Nothing's too early for me, sir. No, I mean, the cook-offs in two weeks. - Well, that can wait. - Mm-hmm, well, what is it you came for? I came to ask you about a man that once worked here, Pedro Alvarez. I believe he used to take care of your horses. He did. He did. What's it to you? Well, it could possibly mean a lot. We reopened a case of a young man who disappeared 15 years ago, Jimmy Davis. Jimmy Davis. Jimmy Davis. How come I knew that as soon as I heard a knock on the door? I have no idea, sir. Okay. Good luck with your procedures, but in the meantime, I don't want anybody, you know... snooping around my property asking questions because this is private property. - I hope you understand that. - I understand that. And I respect your privacy. Perhaps we can have a more formal meeting in the future. - Perhaps. - Perhaps. Thank you. Man: So what do you want me to do about it? Keep track of everything she does. What is "everything"? "Everything" means everything. Just keep her off her game, whatever it takes. Within reason, okay? - All right. - We'll talk later. All right. Asshole. Grandpa! Grandpa! Come on, Buster. Let's go. Come on, buddy. Yeah! Thanks, man, for taking my kids to my wife's house. - Appreciate it. - Maddie, Maddie. I'll make some bunk beds. You can stay forever. - Give me a hug. - Bye, grandpa. - Love you. - Love you too. Okay. Johnny have the horses ready. Let me kiss you. Tell your mom I love her, okay? We'll be back together soon. All right? You, you be good. Hey, Grandpa, I'm a Texas Ranger. If you don't let me take over your ranch, I'll arrest your bow-legged ass. I love you. That little bastard. He always get me. Oh, shit. Oh, come back soon. Come back soon, right? - I'll be damned, bye-bye. - Bye. All I've seen is this. I don't wanna go crazy with it. I just wanna scare her out of here. Chica nuevos. What am I supposed to feed my dogs? Why don't you feed your dog your tiny dick? Yeah, man, this interaction isn't for blood, or it's not about money. It's more about... maybe we get a little pussy. - Right? - Oh, hell, yeah. All right, everybody get a shovel and dig your head out of the pussy 'cause you can't see straight. I'm talking to you about this. Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm saying no firearms. There's gonna be no shooting. Right? Just scare her. That's it. I don't think you understand, though. What if she's shot? That's not gonna be good for any of us if she gets killed. This is the Texas Rangers, all right? There's gonna be repercussions for it. But what if? If she gets killed, then I suggest you get across the river back to Mexico. You can go to goddamn China, wherever you want to. Im asking you you in or are you out? Are you in or are you out? I'll find somebody else like that. - You in- - You know what? I'm in. - All right. - Okay. All right. And you're out. Okay. Let's go. We're done. Scott: Haven't talked in nine and a half years, okay? How many you put in the ground since then? Only- only two, huh? Better than I am. Listen to me, for once. Listen to me. I- I need- l need all right, okay, I need- yeah, I need Ben to call Maria. It's very, very important, all right? A' City boy. Look who's here. Coming here to drag us into the 21 st Century or what? - Maybe. - Yeah? - Good to see you - Good to see you, too. Maria, hi. - Johnny - Good to see you. Pop. Man, boy, good to see you. Welcome home. I'm here to see my brothers and Maria and take care of that will. Yeah, well, that's the only way I could get you to come here. Through Maria. Maria knows best. She's the boss. Welcome home. Your- your room's is waiting on you, okay? I remember where it is. - See you up there. - See you. Good to see you, son. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Man: How are you? Maria: I'm good, how are you? Man: How's the family? Uh, the family? Well, you know my mom died seven years ago. - Mm-hmm. - And, well, my father, he left, and I never heard from him. - Mm. - You know, he vanished. Yeah. But you're my family, so. You look good. You look very handsome. Have you been eating well? Yeah. I don't know if I'm gonna... - go eat dinner. - What? I'm just gonna stay here, maybe take a walk. No. It's weird. It's weird. No, it's not weird, and supper's ready, and I'm gonna sit with you, and everything's gonna be fine. - You're gonna sit with me? - Of course. I'll be next to you. If you sit next to me, then I'll go. Yes. Yeah? I missed you so much. You're the brother I never had. Yeah. I'm lying. I think I always had a crush on you. Oh, really? Really. Well, I wish I had known that earlier. We could have saved a lot of problems. Yeah, I think so. Let's go. Come on. - I'll help you with that later. - All right. Hello. Welcome. Hey, Johnny, how are you doing out Atlanta all day? God dang, I heard a lot about you. Good to finally meet you. Everybody sit down. Known your old daddy a while. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'd just like to say that I'm very- I'm very pleased and moved, I really am, that my sons, my three sons the first time in many years are being here together, and it makes me very, very happy. And very emotional. Okay? Benny, I'm so happy that he's here. I am very happy. But are we okay for now? Are we okay for now? - Are we okay? - Yeah. I'm asking you. Yeah, we're okay, dad. - Okay, good. - It's good to be here. - Yeah. - It's great to see y'all. S0 did you meet ID? He's been my partner. - All right. - Ben, good to meet you. Heard a little bit about you. - Pretty crappy business partner. Hadn't earned me a damn cent, but he's- I've been saving that for you. I'm holding it for your boy. Yay! I'm not used to saying grace, but maybe we should say a little grace. Maybe somebody should say some. KC or... yeah, you or which. Come on. Somebody. There's no before and there's no after. There's only now and love. S0 let us love each other like Jesus said. I love Jesus, but I like to drink a little. Let us pray for our brother Ben. Give him love and welcome him home. Thank you. And the food, too. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Yeah, now we got a surprise for you. Okay, I'm ready. Milo? Come on. - Oh, no! - Good God! Oh, wow. Maria: Oh, my God. Ben: What do you got there, Milo? This was my favorite kid goat. That was your favorite goat? What was his named? His name, uh, is Billy. - Billy Goat. - That was Billy. In honor- in honor of Benny's homecoming, Benny, I cooked him especially for you. - Welcome home. - Thank you, Milo. Can't wait to dig in. I'm glad you kept the teeth in that. Applause for Milo. A' - Where you going, Benny? Where you going? - I'll be back. - I'll be back. I'll be back. - Where are you going? He said he'll be back, Pop. - Hola. - Hey. Thank you. - You okay? - Yeah. Did you have a good time? It was all right. Oh, gosh. Freak show. What are you doing? Dance with me. No. No. Your father dances with me. - What? - Yeah. My dad dances with you? Yeah, like... No, no, no, no, no. - Like this? - Yeah, I swear. That's my daddy. Let me dance with you! I'd rather dance with my horse! He's in love with that horse. Almost love you as much as my horse, Maria! Man: You got too many men driving your blues- I Woman: I I'm Singing that same damn song I Hear me now Nobody but you I Can save you from you I Hear me now... A' Ben: Dad, what you did to me that night... I'll never forget it, and I'll never understand it. You told me to read the Bible, and I did. Leviticus. Is it worse for two men to lie together or for King David to send a man to battle to die so that he can lay with his wife? What's worse? Nothing to say? You always protected yourself with silence. I guess you still do. Samantha: It turns out that Pedro Alvarez stays at Isabel's Convenience Store, and I really need to speak with him. He's Isabel's relative. I would like to go to Linda Rosa to meet with them. Man: Okay, I'll arrange for Rogers to go with you. He knows the town well. - I don't need that clown, sir. - No, you go with him. - Yes, sir. Okay. - Did you get that car for Cody? Yeah, I'm driving Cody's new car, and I think he's going to like it. What the hell was that? I just got shot at, sir. Dad... where's Jimmy? What happened to him? I have no idea whatsoever. - He's around, huh? - Absolutely. I'm only concerned about you and the rest of us, - the family, that's it. - The family? Yeah, what there is of it, yeah. I've been going a little downhill since you left. I feel better now. I think back to this particular time... when I got bucked off a horse, and you told me to get back on, and... you did it in such a kind way, I... I just like TO Think about I'! 'Cause it kind of offsets what happened. It's not enough to make me forget, but it helps a little bit. Yeah. Thank you, son. Come in, fellas. Okay. Special day. special day. - Yeah. - Sony Have a seat. Maria, come over here. Over here. You're late. You're always late. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. There you go, darlin'. - Your dad wanted me to go over a few things- - Hold on. How come we're here like this? A will is a totally private family thing, right? - Private? - That's what I was about to explain to you, if you'd just give me a second. Okay, go ahead. Your dad wanted everybody here together as family because he wanted the entire family to understand everything. He wanted- he wanted it all out in the open. - Is that right, Scott? - Yes, sir. S0 we've laid out a very simple plan. Basically, the 40,000 acres be broken up equally in four ways. What are you talking about, four ways? Pop. Hold on a second here. No, no, no, no. Let him finish, all right? Go head, John. Let him finish. Your dad's laid it out in very simple terms, laid it out very nicely. 10,000 acres to each of the boys, 10,000 acres and the ranch house to Maria Anna Gonzalez. Uaughs) Pop, Pop- Scott: I know what you're gonna say. Right, Maria's not a part of this family. - Not really. - Maria: I know. - Right, Maria? - I know. - This is a family deal here. - I know. I love Maria, you know we all do, - like a sister, but, Dad- - Hold on a minute. As I said before, this is probably the happiest day of my life as well as the toughest. I'd like to say she's not just like a sister to you. Excuse me. She is your sister. Jesus. And a daughter that I care for and love maybe more than anyone. I want you all to know that. All right? Maria? Explain yourself. I can't right now. I can't. Any further questions at the moment, you can ask John. I have to... get some fresh air. We can talk later, Maria, if you'd like. But, uh... in the meantime, I want you all to remember this. This is your sister. She's blood now. K door opens 3 Well. Maria. Welcome to the family. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. I'm just glad I'm gay, otherwise I would've married my sister. She still in there? Of course she's still in there. She's waiting. She- she didn't go out the other door? Hey, Pop. This is the only door. Okay. Yeah. All right. I guess I better go back in. Think I should? Yeah, I think so. All right. Okay. Well, looks like we got us a beautiful Mexican sister and a homosexual brother. You call it "gay," Johnny. I don't know about that. We'll figure it out. Hey)'- If you hadn't given her 10,000 acres, I would have given her mine, and I still might. I don't understand. Why was I always treated like a daughter, but never told I was a daughter? That's beyond me. Yeah, I know it makes sense to you, but certainly not to me. And who was Tomas? Just a make-believe father? Maybe he ran off, left your mother. I wonder why. S0 why are you telling me now? Why what? Why didn't you tell me long before this? Were you ashamed? Why would I be ashamed? You're my daughter. I don't know. You seem to have all the answers. Are you ashamed because I am the product of your unwed Mexican maid? Might that have something to do with- Listen- no listen to me. I loved your mother. I did. You didn't answer my question. It didn't look right in this particular community of yours. Is that it? Maybe. There doesn't seem to be a maybe here. Yes or no. Yes or no. Hey, I'm a coward. Oh, yes, you are. Don't play the victim on me here now. It's too late for that. Well, I hope someday that I can be forgiven. Oh, please. Don't do that. If I ever decide to forgive anybody, it would be me who decides, not you. This one time, my dear father, you can't decide. I won't let you. Go home and rest. I'm sure you need it. I have things to do. Is that like- is that like a southern turn-on? Did we ever play smear the queer with you? - What- - Did we? What the eff is smear the queer? - Smear the queer, man. - What is that game? Tell me about that game. Cow patty on your face with a bamboo stick. Actually, you know what? I think you did. - And that's why I turned gay. - I think that's probably why. I think you turned me gay, brother. - No way. - Yeah. Thank you. - He says gay. How do you call it? - Yeah. I say why can't you just say "homosexual"? Sometimes, we pronounce it "g'ay." G'ay? That's like you're choking? What is that? G'ay? You lost it. You drank way too much, Johnny. Johnny, ignorant son of a bitch. - Just shut your trap. Shut your trap. - I wanna know! What do you wanna know? Tell me what you wanna know. Who gets on top first? - What? - Who swings the bat? - No, I'll lay it out. - Oh, Jesus. - Who gets on top first? - Yeah. Well, we flip a coin. That's how we do it. Sometimes, Rochambeau. - Rochambeau? - Rochambeau. - What does that mean? - Paper, rock, scissors. "I'm a dumb redneck heterosexual." What's the dirtiest, wildest sex you ever had? Shit. Johnny, stop. Stop! Hey, knock it off over there. It's not a library, man! - All right, come on. - Shut up! - Or you come over here and I'll kick your ass. - Let's get out of here. Come on. Come on. Come on, Johnny. All right, all right. Hey, stick it up your ass, pal! Ben: Hey, he didn't mean it. - You! - Come on, come on. Hey, hey, hey, you all right? - Take a couple of deep breaths. Walk it off. - Come here, come here. Fresh air. Getting excited. Hey, jackass. You want a piece of me? - Yeah, I do. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I'm not talking to you, asshole. - Yeah, you're talking to me. - Who's the asshole? I got this. I got this. I got this. - Back off, man, I'm not talking to you, little faggot. - What? - Who's the faggot now, huh?! - Yeah, get out of here! - Get out of here! - Come on. Ben: Get the fuck out of here. That was awesome! You're starting trouble, man! Awesome. You were a buzz saw in there. - Thank you, sir. - Papa's right. You must have been a hell of a street fighter when you were younger. Yeah, pop taught me a thing or two. I was a little off my game. I got bumped into something, but how'd I do? Oh, you were an animal. You weren't worth a shit even though you started it. - Come on, man! - You weren't worth shit! I thought I got someone. You remind me of pop a little bit sometimes. How's that? I was told when my pop was a young man, he'd got in a fight with the sheriff and knocked that guy on his ass in front of a bunch of people on account of a guy called him a draft dodger during the Korean War. Guy never mentioned anything to pops again. - Never said shit. - I believe that. Chip off the old block, both of you. - What happened to you? - I don't know, man. - A lover of all things. - A gentle heterosexual. Straight. Straight. - Go, go, go, go. - Go get him, Cody! Get him, boy! - All right. - Way to go, Cody. Good job. Good roping today. Your dad would be proud. S0 how come you never talk about your father? Every time his name comes up, you change the subject. Why? Because he was a very violent man, and at the same time, I love him very much. What do you mean? What do I mean? Hmm. Well, last time I saw him, he came storming into the kitchen like a maniac, and you never knew what set him off... and as violent as you can imagine a man can be. And... you can only see his hand... going to my throat, and then you feel the wall. And I was just so tired of being afraid, so tired that I decided that that was going to be it. S0 I stare at him. And I said, "Well, go for it." I said, "Go for it." And you can see his fist going by my face and hitting the wall. And I opened my eyes, and I stare at him, and he looked like a... demon, and, um- and he just walk away. And that was it. We're set. You ready? Yeah. Let's go. Give me a hug. Oh, I love you so much. S0 much. Lock the doors. We're closed, but how can I help you? Hello, Mrs. Isabel? Yes? Hi, I'm looking for Eduardo Valdez. And who wants to know? We do, the Texas Rangers. Well, he's not here. He comes and goes. Oh, I see. Should I tell him that you are looking for him? Yes, please. I just left my business card. If he can call me whenever he has a chance, - I will really appreciate it. - I'll do that. Thank you very much, ma'am. Have a good night. - You're welcome, good night. - Good night. Be careful out there, it's kinda dangerous. - Yeah, take care yourself. Bye. - Thank you. I went to Joe's Bar. Bartender told me there was a in town, a new guy, so I followed him out, pulled him over. That's not bad for a new guy. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Looks great. - Squeezing on it like it's a pair of titties ain't gonna get you any closer to getting a job. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Listen, man- - Hey, man. Hey, man- We talk about business here. This stuff in your hand has no value. No value? Why are you here if it has no value? Man: How are we gonna sell that? Man: Let me make a point to you. You're fighting for 70% of this, yeah? You want 70% of zero, nothing, nada? Or you want 60% of this? It's your call. What do you want? I want 40% instead of 30. I'm not doing 30. No way, man. No way, asshole. Hey, we can talk. You don't have to call me an asshole. Call me asshole again, I'm gonna slap you in the goddamn mouth. - Just give it a try. - Just talk. You want to do business, to business, but just talk. - You need me to sell stuff. - I don't need you. I need somebody to sell stuff. You think I can't get somebody else, you're wrong, my friend, you're wrong about that. - Mm-hmm. - 40. All right. Let's do the deal, asshole. That comes out your end. Look my face of concern. Look your face of concern. - All right. - Look my face of celebration. - All right. Good. - Yeah, 40. Deal. Man: Hey, Sheriff, what's your 20? Man: 67 and 11. Man: Okay, good. You're right behind me. Listen, I got a text from Sam. It was real vague, but apparently, she stumbled on a drug deal going down at that warehouse in Minarosa. You gotta know this- your Deputy Rogers is inside that building. Man: 10-4 Here you go. You got a girl? Man: No. You seem sad about it. - It's not our business, man. - Huh? - That's not our business. - You want to talk business, let's talk about the $1,000 you owe me that I paid you to scare a Ranger and nothing happened. - What? What? What? - What do you want? Want a refund or a credit store or something? - Who? - A store credit. - In English. What's that? - A store credit. - Store credit? - Yeah. How about that? That's business, what you want to talk about. All right, man, take from the cut. - All right? No worries. - No worries. It's a good thing for you and me both - that kid got killed, too. - I know. You'd be in prison- - Let me see your hands. - Down, down, down, down! - Hands behind your back. - Don't move. Y'all got here two seconds later I don't know what. Asshole. Yesterday, you were teaching these kids about drugs, and now you're doing this shit? Si! I don't know who you're working for, asshole, but you're a disgrace to our profession. - You understand? - Answer him. - Yes, sir! - Get your ass up. Get this crap up around here. Come here. Sit up. Sit up. I'll say it again. There's no Pedro Alvarez. I'd hit the road if I were you. Whatever you say, bud. Thank you, Mrs. Isabel. Thank you for helping us. Oh, you're welcome. The one that lived in Mexico and now you live here? Back and forth. I'm with the Texas Rangers, Mr. Alvarez. And I came to ask you about Ben and Scott Briggs. Do you know what happened to Jimmy Davis who took care of Briggs' horses? In my pueblo, there is little- this little tiny bird that is brilliant red- rojo, rojo" red with little black wings. He flies up and down the canyon. And what does he do all day long? He lives to catch flies. Can you help us? I am very sorry it didn't work out. I'm sorry. Man: Don't feel bad. This generation of Mexicans hate the Texas Rangers. I know. Hello, Mr. Scott. The Texas Ranger Samantha Payne is waiting in your office. Oh... Well, just open the floodgates, you idiot. Open the floodgates! Please be seated. What can I do for you? I came to ask you about Jimmy Davis. Jimmy Davis? What about him? Did you know that your son and Jimmy Davis had an affair? No, no, that never happened. That's just small-town rumors. That confirms that they did have an affair. $0? I believe his disappearance was a hate crime. A hate crime? How long you been doing your job, young lady? Because you have a picture of a man who is missing, you come to the simple conclusion that me or anyone out here had anything to do with this man's disappearance. You can't go and start arresting people anywhere you look. I mean, everybody has someone to hate. I have someone. You have someone. And let me tell you something. The Mexicans hate the blacks. The blacks hate the white. My white neighbor hates women. And my liberal lawyer hates my Republican friends, and my Republican friends hate my liberal lawyer. But the work gets done. Do you have anything to do with Jimmy Davis' disappearance, sir? I have never done anything to that man, and if you think I have, then what can I say? I understand you have made comments that you do believe that gay people are evil. Those are strong feelings of hate, Mr. Briggs, and hate can bring confusion to a man that wants to control everything and everyone around him. I believe in justice just like everyone else. Do you, Mr. Briggs? Yes, I do. Now please leave my office. I met with Pedro Alvarez. Pedro Alvarez. Pedro Alvarez. And what did he say? He said plenty. He said what? Who lets the Texas Rangers onto my property?! Who does that? My goddamn cook! He not only cooks the soup and my fried chicken and lets anybody onto my property that he wants me to! I don't get it! I don't get it! You know, they arrested that Rogers guy in a drug bust. They what? Yeah, they got him in custody. - They got him. - Okay, now, you listen to me and listen good. I don't want some cheap Texas Ranger bitch roaming around this property asking a bunch of questions. I don't want her on this property or anywhere near! You hear me?! Nowhere! If she does, only I talk to her! You understand? Only me! Only me! Where's Ben? He's never around here. - Where's Ben? - She's just doing her job. What are you getting so worked up for? - Give her a pass. - Give her a pass? For what, you friggin' retard? You friggin' retard! Give her a pass. Who's the retard? We invited her to the barbecue next week. - Who invited? - Not me, old man, not me. - You did. - Then uninvite her. Get her on the phone this goddamn minute and uninvite that sneaking bitch! - You hear me? - No way. - What do you mean no way? - No way, you do it. Oh, I do what you- oh, you thimble-headed redneck son of a bitch. Yeah? Yeah? Step up! Now, listen to me- I don't want that bitch anywhere around me, you understand me? Nowhere around me. Now... clean all this shit up, clean it up before supper. Clean it up yourself, you asshole. Kiss my ass 27 times, you prick. Speak up, Johnny. You never say anything. Get out of my way. Don't you pick it up. Don't you pick it up. Samantha: I wanna ask you about Jimmy Davis. Sure. What do you want to know? You were having an affair with Jimmy Davis. Well, that's nobody's business. I'm not here to judge you, Mr. Briggs. Mm-hmm. I'm sure it was very difficult for you to be a gay man in a town of machos like the one we're in. It's like you'd expect. I pretended to be straight. Uh-huh. I made sure to date the prettiest girls. I was the one to always start the fights - so no ones starting with me. - Mm-hmm. Just pray to be like everyone wanted me to be. How'd your father react when he learned you were guy? My father is a tough guy. and you can't tell him anything. But my mother... she told me to go live my life. Some people, they'll never accept it. That's true. That's true. Was anybody with you and Jimmy the last time you saw him? The last time I saw him? - Yeah, was anybody with you? - No. - No? - No. Do you believe that blood runs thicker than truth, sir? No. I don't know why you're asking me that, but no. It's okay. I found this. Anybody out there? Who's hungry? She's got me. Red: Knock, knock. Who's there? Red. Red? Red Who? Your redneck prick son of a bitch son, that's who. What do you want smashed before you pick it up, huh? - You want this? - Pick your spot, pick your spot. Yeah. I missed you guys at supper. Where's Johnny at? Johnny's getting divorced, Pop. Tell him not to worry. It's not the end of the world. Probably best not to tell him anything. No, you're right, you're right. S0 this whole little court chitchat gets caught up, okay? - I gotta get going. - What do you mean? You just got here. I'll see you in the morning. We can bust up more shit. - Who's gonna clean it up? - You are? - Me? Oh, bullshit. - Walk me to the door. All right. Hold on, hold on. Oh, yeah, I wanna ask you, things with Sandy are better, I hope. Better. Thanks. Yeah. Good girl. Don't let her go, son. She's too good, tell you that. - She's great. - Yeah. I finally cut off that other deal. I gotta stay at what's right for me. Can't let it be said that the apple or whatever doesn't fall far from the tree. Yeah, right, hey, hey, hey, hey, get out of here. - Right. - Yeah. See you tomorrow. Right. One other thing. They're coming after me again. Yeah, I know. - You hang in there, Pop. - Okay. All right. Looking good. Looking good. Where's Johnny at? He told me to saddle your horse. Just warming him up for you. I hope you don't mind. - Why would I mind? - Okay. Hadn't lost too much there, son. Good. Yeah. Getting long in the tooth here, so. Need all the help, I can get. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, darlin'. Whoa. Whoa. Yeah. Once I'm up here... I feel a lot better than I do down on the ground, that's for damn sure. You know, you never answered my question about what happened. Of course I did. You just don't listen. I have no idea. S0 he just disappeared. Seems kind of impossible, don't you think? I been over this a thousand times. How many teen suicides do you think there are yearly in America, let alone Texas? - I don't know. - Well, look it up on your Google deal. Lake Brownwood or any of these other lakes throughout the state? All right? Just chalk another one up. That's all you have to say. Well, what else is there? You know... I missed you, Dad. Even if I don't understand you, and I'd like to know you better. But I guess both of our hearts are closed. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe. And I guess you'll never accept that I'm gay. Benny, Ben boy, I- I- I mean... why you do what you do, whatever you do, but I'm working on it, son. You are? Then why don't you listen to me? Why don't you put yourself in my shoes? We'll switch roles for a minute. - Why would I do that? - I tell you why. What do you think happens between two men? What do you think we do when we're in private? I'm not so sure I want to know. It makes no sense to me, son. Well, I can explain it to you. I can tell you. I can tell you exactly what happens. Want to hear? I'm not talking about slow dancing and honky-tonk. I'm talking about what happens in the wee hours. Want me to tell you? I don't think so. We could wait until another day. - All right? - All right. Well, you can think about or you cannot think about it, but that's the situation. That's what's going on. 15 years ago is the same as today. S0 you can put another gun to my head and say, "Get the fuck off the Briggs ranch," or you can be a real man and accept what's going on. You just think about it. Another thing- congratulations. "Love" was a non-existent word on this ranch. And I heard you use it the other day when you were expressing yourself to Maria. I'd never heard you utter that word once, not even to mother years ago before you run her off. S0 congratulations. Buried that word a long time ago. I feel uncomfortable up here, you know? I feel uncomfortable. My mind goes round and round and round and round. Grown men do strange things, Maria. Grown men do strange things. There's only two things in my life I wanted to tell you, all right? I already told you one. And the other? It'll have to wait... to another day. Let's go up top, okay? Did you bring picnic? What'd you cook? - Yeah, it's right there. - Oh, yeah where? The day you cook. I'm trying- trying to remember when you were a little girl, we planted a tree. It was there over there- I can't remember which- which one. It was you... me and your mama planted it. I don't really remember. Oh, you- you don't remember? Well, you were too busy chasing boys. Liar. - What? - Liar. No liar. No, I'm not a liar. Cheyenne, Cheyenne, hop on my pony I You always sing the same song, but never finish it. I never finish it? Well. Let's go on up here. Let's see what's up here. You always- you always liked this horse, didn't you? You always said it was the best horse you ever sat on. That's for sure. Well, starting tomorrow morning, he's no longer mine, he belongs to you. You're gonna ride him from here on in. - Are you serious? - Oh, I'm serious. He's my gift to you, Maria. Just enjoy it. I won't be needing him anymore. Wow. How many sunsets has a person seen in a lifetime, I wonder. Quite a few, I imagine. No, the deal is, how many are left? - Let's go on back. - Let's go. Watch out for the holes. Watch out for the holes. I interviewed your son, Ben, and I know that you and him are lying about Jimmy Davis. I also know that you and that Peter Rogers had an agreement concerning me and possibly my son. You think you're above the law, Mr. Briggs. People like you don't make the world a better place. You think you do. I'm going to find out what it is that you do when nobodys watching you. Ezekiel... Can't forget... I forget where it is. It's, uh... The Lord thy God loved thee... having ingrained thee upon the palms of my hands. YOU don't like what I like? - No, I don't like it. - Why not? You can change the damn thing. Change it. What do you like? What's, what's- - Oh, reggae, you like reggae? - Not reggae. Why don't you sing something? - What? - You sing something. All right. Turn it off. I'll sing you a song that I sing to Maria, and I'll give you $50,000 if you can get the end of it. - All right? - All right. Okay. Cheyenne, Cheyenne, hop on my pony There's room for two or more, never mind the alimony Cheyenne That's all I know of it. My uncle sang it. That's all he knew. He was drunk all the time, but, you know. I gotta guess the end? You don't even know the end. No, I don't know the end. S0 how you gonna know if I have the right end? Well... I'll know. I'll know. Let me hear you, let me hear your- Ramp it up, ramp it up. I'll finish it. Cheyenne, Cheyenne, hop on my pony I There's room for two or more, never mind the alimony - Cheyenne, Cheyenne - Come on, come on. I'm feeling horny Cheyenne, Cheyenne Getting horny for what? Man: I have climbed so many mountains Just to reach the other side And I've near drowned myself in freedom I Just to feed my foolish pride Okay. I'm very sorry... that I couldn't understand you. I'm sorry that when you were all grown up, I made it all about me because like most men, I wanted a perfect family, but like most men, I was not a perfect husband or father. Yeah. And I'm sorry because I know we cannot start over. And that's what I'm most sorry about. So. But I want you to know... I accept you as you are because you're my son. I'm sorry, too. - I've missed you. - Yeah? And I accept you as you are because you're my dad, and you're the only dad I got. Yeah. - All right? - Yeah. You're a good boy. What are we doing here?

Hello? Who are you? What are you doing in my house? Uh, I knocked. I'm sorry. I didn't hear it. Uh... I wanted to tell you what happened to your son. - My son? - Yes. Yes, ma'am. Who are you? I know you. I'm Scott Briggs. We met before. This is my youngest son. He knew your boy. They rode horses together. Yeah. You are really Scott Briggs. Yes, ma'am, I am.

I know this horse. Easy. Come on out. No one's gonna hurt you, son. No one's gonna hurt you. Oh, Lord, what do I do? Oh, Lord, what do I do? What have I done? Oh, son, son. And I couldn't face anyone 'cause everything I did caused it, but I didn't do it. It was kinda like a... a hit and run, but I didn't do it. What happened? Where's my Jimmy? - Your Jimmy? - Yes. Tell me! Oh! Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. I will. I got confused, went crazy. - Who are you? Who the hell are you? - Dad! Dad, let him go! Let him go! My mind broke down and went in... went in circles. I didn't know what to do. S0 what I did was the cowardly thing. I... I buried him. I dug a big hole, and I buried him. And I had to come tell you this today. I had to. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What kind of man are you? Well, lady, grown men do strange things sometimes. We had to make... a grave. The storm washed it away four years ago. You- you had a grave with- with our body. You left us without nothing. Without nothing! Without nothing! It was an accident. - No! - It was an accident. No, no, no, no, no, no,no,no,no. No, no, no, no, no, no,no,no,no.

I knew you might be coming along this way today. How you know that? I just do. That's how I am. I hear your son ropes pretty good. Yeah. Texas state champion. Johnny says he knows your husband. - Says he's a pretty good guy. - You're blocking my door. I'm sorry. Hell of a Marine. - Yeah, Marine pilot. - Mm. My dad's a good guy, too. I hope you know that. I want you to stay away from my father. I don't care if you're a... lady Ranger or whatever. He's the only father I've got, and I gotta make sure I look out for him. What can I do for you? Don't interrupt me. I want you to stay away from my dad. He doesn't need this. That's the bottom line. I hope you hear me. Anything else? No, ma'am, not right now. You're very brave or very stupid. Excuse me. You have a good day. Oh... I think I'll take a little- a little snooze here. Yeah. Yeah. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, Ben boy, little Benny. I love you, too. Yeah. If God won't forgive me... maybe you will someday... l hope. Ooh.. You're a good boy. A' There she is, the girl of my dreams. You've been saying that since we were kids. When we were kids, we would play cowboys and Indians like the kids do. You know, only we would do it with real horses. And guess who always... always got the role of the Indian girl. But now the Indian girl wears a badge. Yeah. You wanna go for a ride? You bet. Let's go. Woke up from underneath IA life I built six-feet deep I sit by the fireside to fool you I Been walking out my time This thinning soul of mine I many miles from the familiar The wind blows cold and I've been told That I ain't gonna last If I outlive the advice I give I just might make it back If i do Would you wait for me? If I do Wait for me Wait for me If I do Wait for me If I do Won't you wait for me? Man: My journey through the darkness I have finally seen light I I know no ones ever loved you Like I'm loving you tonight I There is something you must tell me You think I won't understand How you found such worldly pleasure In the arms of other men I would never try to judge you We have both been wrong and right I But I know no ones ever loved me Like you're loving me tonight J God will save His fallen angels And their broken wings He'll mend When He draws their hearts together And they learn to love again All their sins will be forgiven In the twinkle of an eye I All the saints rejoice in Heaven When the fallen angels fly And there's a story in the Bible About the eagle growing old How it grows new sets of feathers Then becomes both young and strong Then it spreads its mighty wingspan S Out across the open sky I We will have the wings of eagles I When the fallen angels fly
