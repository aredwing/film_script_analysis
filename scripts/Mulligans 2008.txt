Yeah and he's bringing a friend from college. Sweet. l'm-- l'm just gonna... Oh, yeah. Does he play golf too? l haven't met him yet, but we'll find out this afternoon. Guess so. Okay. l'm... l'm good. Oh, yeah. Here you go. That a boy. Thanks. So the four of us are naked running through the town, right? We have no idea which way to go. And all of a sudden this Iook of terror is just like stricken all of our faces. And it's freezing out-- Hey, Tyler, let's go. Sorry, ladies - two seater. First. See if the victim is conscious and breathing. Second. Call for help in a loud, clear voice. Help, Help. And third. lf they are not breathing, check the mouth for anything that may be blocking the air hole - like an apple core or something. Hey, Birdy, why are your dollies naked? They were swimming and Lindsay almost drowned. Nakedness is nothing to be ashamed of Birdy, but at the dining room table maybe they could pop on some swim wear. What's on your agenda, Nate? Well, once the boys arrive l thought l'd take them for a round of 1 8. You? Birdy has her swimming exam this afternoon so we'll go down to the beach after lunch. l saw Jeffrey's penis. Who is Jeffrey and why have you seen his penis? He shows it to me under the water at swimming lessons. Hey, Dad! Hey guys, how was the drive? Good. Tyler, You're home! Oh, Birdy! Your brother's home! l can see him. Hi, Birdy. You're getting so big now. Chase, we've heard so much about you. Sounds like you two had a lot of fun this year. Yeah, we did. Nice place. Well, we just summer here. lt's no palace, but it has the basics. We're thrilled to see you, and l know Tyler is too. Yeah, thrilled. Come on in. This is Tyler's sister Birdy. l've got a swimming test today. So if you need saving while you're here, l could probably do it. Cool, l'll keep that in mind. And this is Mr. Davidson. Nathan. Of course you both are adults now. You can call me Stacey. Hey, mom, where are we bunking? You two are in the guest house. lt's a work in progress. Cool. Listen, Birdy and l have to run off to her swimming lesson. So help yourself and if you need anything, just call me on the cell. My sweet baby lamb chop, it's so good to have you close. Okay, Birdy, Iet's shake a leg. Let's shake a leg. When you see Jeffrey's mother, l want you to point her out to me. So mom has calmed down a little bit. What about you Dad? Are you working today? No, no. New summer's resolution. l'm going to leave the office at the office - a more relaxed, happier me. Alright, you're up. Alright, man, you just want to visualize where you want the ball to go. You want to get it in the hole, okay? Now, if you can get it in on, the first shot all the better but most guys got to work up to it, okay? Alright. l thought golf was a quiet game. Nice and easy, keep it relaxed. Ty, knock it off. Let the guy play. Good. Good. You're, uh...good. That's what we call that shooting blanks. You gotta visualize the cup. Visualize the cup. Alright, here we go. Just remember to keep your head down because... Aw, jeez, l'm sorry. Like father like son, huh? Whoa, okay, wow. Okay, you've got passion behind that but, uh... Which is good, but let's just focus some of that energy. Use your club to get you pointed in the right direction. There you go. Feet shoulder-width apart. Nice, then put just a slight bend in the knees. A little less. Now just keep your head down and let the club do the work. Better. l'm gonna cross the tree line to my Goddamn ball. Chase, Chase, Chase what are you doing? You don't wanna use that. Why not? Well, on the fairway you want to use a club that'll give you a little lift. Uh, like a 7? Too much lift. Try a 3. Okay, man, visualize the ball going in the hole. Nice and easy, okay? You wanna watch that grip. lt should be firm and loose all at the same time because you don't want to have a wussy shot. Seriously, coach- shut up. Four! Hey, whoa! What are you guys doing? You trying to kill me? Sorry! l didn't mean to... You hit my dad! You're a big target, Dad! Sorry! Don't forget your ball. You alright? Welcome to the lake, dude. That was chilly. So is your sister's name really Birdy? Actually it's Barbie, but when she was four she hated it so much she changed it to Birdy and it just sort of stuck. l thought you said your dad was uptight. Yeah. Well, he usually is. Maybe it's like a mid-life crisis or something. He seemed pretty young to me. Yeah, well you have to remember l'm the product of a teen pregnancy. My parents had me when they were in high school. Okay. Okay, really! l think we should have a rule this year that maybe you kind of keep yourself covered up, just as a courtesy. You know like a sock or pants or a toque or a beanie - anything, really. It doesn't matter. Sort of a common courtesy to me, l think it will do our relationship good and also to the neighbors. l think they might appreciate it. Cool? Birdy! Birdy! This is your mother, what are you doing? Get away from that boy! You two, come with me. Mom! You're embarrassing me. l'm embarrassing you? l wasn't the one cavorting out in the middle of the lake in front of the whole beach. l suppose you're Jeffrey? l didn't do anything! l know exactly what you did, you little pervert. Excuse me? Is there a problem here? Yes, l'm handling the situation. Well, l'd like to help you 'handle the situation'. This is my son. Well, that makes sense. This little nudist son of yours has been showing my daughter his penis. You think that's funny? lt's a violation of her childhood. l wasn't showing my penis. l was showing a minnow! Minnow. For sure. Mom, he's telling the truth. He was just showing me a minnow. This is unbelievable. l don't care what we all want to call it, children of eight should not be sharing that kind of thing. Let's just relax. They're kids. At this rate, not for long. Grab your things, Birdy. We're leaving. Bye, Jeffrey. Sorry. Wow, what a spread. That's why it's so hot in here. Turkey in June? lt's our first meal as a whole family together again. l thought it was more appropriate than throwing burgers on the barbecue. l like burgers better. We can have burgers another night. How was your golf game, boys? Dad was playing his usual game - up the opposite fairway. Your father does tend to go about things backwards. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. It was a joke, dear. Chase, what do your parents do? Uh, my mom doesn't work. Oh, a stay-at-home mom like me! No wonder you've turned out such a respectable young man. Actually, she's nothing like you. She's not exactly busy being a mom. So does your father work? No, he died when l was five. l'm sorry to hear that. Can we eat? Yes, yes, of course. What was l thinking? l'll light the candles. So who's going to be here? You know, lake friends my girlfriend Bre. What's up, Kimble? Girlfriend? Yeah, you know, summer-thing. Oh, and it's Andrew's party. See if you can guess his nickname. Alright. Game on, Davidson. What's up, dude? Not in my parents' bedroom again! Anal Andy? That's one for one. Hey, guys, this is my friend Chase. Hey, everybody! What's up, Joseph. This is my buddy Chase! Hey! Guys, this is Chase. He's with me, okay? Beer Bongs! MUSIC Give it to Chase! Alright, here we go! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Yeah! l gotta go to the bathroom. Alright. You know, that's a tough question because really l like blondes and brunettes equally. Tyler Davidson. That's where the bathroom is. Bre Hamilton. Lose my number? l lost my cell phone. Now do you want to go in the bathroom with me or what? Hey, Chase! Hi! Bre! Nice to meet you! Tyler's talking about you all the time at college. Yeah, at college, l'm talking about you all the time. Tyler! Lubiniecki? That is not a mustache. You're so pretty. l know, right? lt's so great to meet you after all this time. l've been hearing about you. You too. You have to meet my friends, Jarod and Christie. Alright. Yeah. Hey, you guys. Look who l found. Get in there. Sam...Sammy... l can do this... l'm great at this. Mamacita! You want something to drink? Yeah, l'll take a beer. l love him. He's like my brother. So what's your major? Seriously? Yeah. Art. l'm a painter. Oh, you paint. That's sexy. Well, it's dirty. You're funny. And cute. We should hang out. Yeah, for sure. They're ridiculously cute, huh? Yeah. Every summer they come back and it's just like clockwork. Right on schedule. Well, Mr. Painter if you're ever looking for a model or anything-- l'm more of a landscape guy. Oh. l'm gonna get a beer. What? l'm gonna get a beer. Oh. Seriously, man, she is on the prowl. Right. So be careful - she will bite. But if you're into that, that's cool. Or if you're not, that's cool too. Don't know, don't care. Beer? Yeah, one more. You're alright, man. Hey, good party, Andy. My hot tub smells like urine. Chase, we're taking off and Bre's staying with us. Or you can stay at Christy's. Uh, no, l'm good. l'm all done. Hey, this is gonna be a fun summer, huh? Just the three of us? This is gonna be the best summer ever. Marty, hey! Come on! First day, right? First day. l'm Chase, remember? Hey. Hey. You working today or just goofing off? l've just been doing laps around the service road. lt's been working out pretty well. Cool. You feel like catching a movie tonight? The girls are coming over. Hot tub night. The girls? Yeah. Bre and Christie. Right. Great. l'm going to go take a nap on 1 7, then we'll switch. l promise this time. Right. Ham and cheese and a coffee to go. Chase? Hey, Mr. Davidson. Well hey, if you're having Iunch, come join me? So where's that partner in crime of yours? Oh, he went for lunch with Bre. So how's all the manual labor going? Well, it's paying off my student loans, so no complaints. There may be a lot of lawn care in my future though. Wait a minute - l thought you wanted to be a painter, not a gardener. Yeah, that's the plan. So Tyler said that there's maybe an art store around here? Absolutely, yeah. l think it's right around the corner, actually. lf you've got time we can head there. Yeah, that'd be great. After we're done eating. So what inspires you to paint? Every artist is different. l just paint what l see. So no landscapes? Take a picture, people are more interesting to me. l'm gonna check on some supplies. Here are your canvases. Perfect. Hey, you know what? Let me get that. No, l can do it. lt's on me. Just pay me back when you're famous. Thank you. Wait, hold on. Now back slowly... Oh, wait, wait, wait. Check it out. Check it out. Ow! One sec. Sit down, put your feet closer together again. Let's go again, Iet's go again. l'm no math wizard but l think we won by one. Nice! Blah, blah, blah, blah. l'm gonna take the girls to a movie. You want to come? No, l'm good here. Thanks. Alright, Ms. Muffet, time for your bath. But Mom! No buts... Just your butt in the tub. Go! See you, boys. Christie's gonna be disappointed. Yeah, maybe. Oh, you already have a girlfriend. No, it's just... l already know l won't be into it so why pretend and then Iet her down, right? Okay, Casanova. l'm just saying our interests are a little too similar. Hey, do you want another beer? Yeah. Alright, cool. Come on. l'll show you the best place in the house. Thanks. Pretty amazing view, isn't it? Yeah. Good place to just sit and watch life go by. Makes you want to be doing the things you want to do. You know? It goes all by so fast. What? You have no idea. l'm just saying, you know, to leave my mark somehow, make a difference... What would you want to change? l don't know. Stuff. Sounds like heavy stuff. Was it weird gettin' married right out of high school? l don't know about weird. lt's just what happened. Do you ever wonder if you picked the right person? No. Yeah, sometimes. Choices have to be made at the time and you make them and then your life becomes your life. l sometimes wonder if l would have made different choices. Like what? Just different. What are you laughing at? Nothing. You just look like Tyler when you said that. No, what you mean to say is Tyler looks like me. l'm the original. Right. Chase is in the guest cottage and your dad's home. Not in the car. What about on the hood? Do you at least have a blanket? l have a towel. Okay. You want to mess around? Now? Or we don't have to. No, l'd like to. But are you sure? Do you want to or not, Stacey? You're not all that attractive when you're grumpy. Forget it. Come on, l was just surprised - that's all. No, forget it. l'm not in the mood anymore. l'm going to sleep. Morning. Morning. Dad, l can't believe you get up that early and go running. At your age shouldn't you be knitting or something? Thanks, smart ass. Nathan! Actually, you should try running. A little endurance might help your golf game. Are you enjoying the work at the course, boys? Are you finding it challenging? Mom, we're painting a fence. lt's not like we're using our college education. l'm just trying to show interest and talk about something other than golf. There are other people at this table. Maybe you'd like to know what Birdy has planned for the day. Would anyone like some more waffles? We haven't even started yet. Well, we'd best get started then, shouldn't we? Your mother is right. lt's polite to show interest. Otherwise we can seem cold or frigid. Sometimes that's what people do when the actions of others seem erratic or unusual. lt's difficult for a person to attempt spontaneity if they're greeted with ridicule. lf you don't tend your chickens, they'll never produce a golden egg. Okay, okay. l get it. Show a little interest. Birdy, what are you doing today? Mom doesn't like that l've seen a penis, so l have to start tennis lessons. That's great. That's really great. Great waffles, Mom. Oh, every year l have to paint this stupid fence. Do you think we should have sanded it first? l don't know. l don't think it really matters. You know what? You really need to call Christie. She's not really my type. Man, stop being such a fag. You don't have to marry her, you just gotta hit it. l don't wanna hit it. Okay? l told you, l'm not into it. Just leave it alone. Don't worry about it. l'm gonna call Bre. We're going to set you guys up for tonight. Tyler, stop. Okay? Alright. Man, what's gotten into you? Listen, l should have told you this a long time ago. So, if you're gonna be mad and kick me out or whatever l'd rather it just be now. Why would l kick you out? 'Cause if you can't deal with it then l don't want to hang around you either. Uh, you're not making a whole Iot of sense right now, man. Okay, we're friends right? Yeah. So it shouldn't matter but if it does... l get it and-- Look, l'm tired of pretending. lt's exhausting. So if you're gonna hate me, just hate me. What are you talking about? Tyler, l'm gay. Yeah, right. Seriously, l am. Seriously? Yeah. Yeah, right. You're shittin' me. That's a good one. Tyler, l'm gay. You're not... for real? Yeah. Real deal? Are you sure? Yes, l'm sure. Holy shit! My best friend is gay. lt doesn't mean you are. l know. So are we cool? Yeah, it's cool. Honey, let me tie up your shoe laces. Did you have fun? Yeah. Jenna is really cool. Good. l'm sure she'll be a positive influence for you. She smells nice too. Okay, let's hurry. We need to get supplies for your burger night. l don't want a burger. Jenna is a vegetarian. She thinks that eating animals is totally gross. Really? That Jenna sounds like quite the gal. l'll be in the car. Oh, hey. Looking for something? You scared me. Sorry, l was just... just taking a time out. l just came in to get some rags to clean up. You better use one to get that paint out of your hair. Yeah, we were working on a fence today. l think l ended up with more paint on me than the fence. lt kind of looks like it. You better clean up before the barbecue because Stacey will have a fit. Mom, can l get my ears pierced like Jenna's? She has three earrings in each ear. Birdy, just focus on mixing that salad. Our guests will be here shortly. We still need to make up the hamburger patties. Mom! l can't eat hamburger. Tyler, will you go to the store and pick up some Veggie burgers for Birdy? She's decided not to eat meat anymore. lf you see your dad, ask him to light the barbecue. Dad! You gotta light the barbecue! Thank you. Hey, Dad! Oh, hey. What are you doing? Just taking a moment. You are getting old. l need to get some Veggie Burgers for Birdy. You wanna come? Yeah. How about you drive, son? Don't mind if l do. Okay. Still got it. l think l heard something snap. By the way - you gotta start the barbecue. You're telling me now? Yeah, Mom said to start the barbecue. Just drive. Jeez! Man, no more meat for Birdy, huh? She's so weird sometimes. Maybe she just needs a little change. But she's always eaten meat. Maybe she never really liked it. Yeah, l think once she gets a taste she's gonna go back? Don't know, maybe she'll be a veggie for life. And you know what? Maybe you should try it. You might surprise yourself. No. l don't need to try it. That stuff is gross. You okay, son? Yeah...no. Well, not really. Chase came out to me today. Like, he told me he was gay. And l'm okay with it. l just kept telling myself, say the right thing, say the right thing. And l don't know if l did. l guess it doesn't change anything, but it kinda changes everything. You know? l don't know. l just don't know if l'm doing the right thing or what to do now. You know, l'd say do the same thing you did yesterday. What's that? He's your best friend, right? Yeah. Just keep being that. That boy chasing you with the water gun? Did he get you? No? You got away from him? You're pretty good. So, you play a round today, Nathan? We're not going to talk about golf today, Jim. We're talking about other interests. Bad game? Dude, you had three double bogies, multiple foot wedges, and you kinda hit like-- Thanks, Felix! That's great. No. We have a new family policy in the house. Stacey introduced it this morning. l was only pointing out that sometimes it's nice to include other people in the conversation - people like Birdy and me, who don't play golf. Maybe both of you should take it up. And then right when the fireworks started he asked her to marry him. lsn't that amazing? Amazing. Did you want a beer? Would you mind? Oh, okay. How about a little football instead? Thank you. Reminds me of us when we were that age. Yeah, a little. l better grab some more burgers. So let's see that good arm of yours. Well, you ain't no Terry Bradshaw. You might be a Lynn Swann. Let's see if you're a Franco Harris. l don't really know who any of those guys are. Well, today Birdy started her tennis lessons. That's great! Mmm, maybe. Maybe? She seems to have taken a fascination with her coach. l don't know if it's healthy. l'm sure he's harmless. She looks harmless but that's all Birdy can ever talk about since the lesson. Jenna this and Jenna that. Mom, l've got a man crush on Brad Pitt. lt doesn't mean l'm gay. l just want her to have a normal childhood. l don't think it's bad to be gay. l'm not saying it's bad. l just don't think l want Birdy to be like...that. Life would be easier for her if she wasn't. l sure as hell wouldn't want any a son of mine growing up queer. Jim! Well, l wouldn't. Birdy can be anything she wants to be. l'd just prefer if she wasn't a lesbian. Okay, wow! Am l hungry! Good thing we're not talking about golf. Birdy! Come get your veggie burger! Hey. Hey. You okay? Yeah, l'm fine. You know what my mom says fine stands for? Fucked up, insecure, neurotic and emotional. So are you fine? Pretty much. Your mom said that? Yeah, she'd been drinking at the time. Hey, that Jim guy is an idiot. He doesn't know his head from his ass. And my mom - she wasn't thinking. lt'd be totally different if she knew. lt's kinda like being a spy. What is? Being gay. 'Cause nobody knows until l tell them. People will be brutally honest because they think nobody's listening. Why didn't you tell me sooner? l didn't know how you'd take it. lf you'd be cool seeing me with a dude. That sounds so weird - a dude. l love you, man. You know, like... like a brother. Not like, you know. Yeah, l know. No sword fights. Right. l love you, too. Maybe we could find a more macho way of saying it. You know, something a little more manly. Go Steelers? Yeah. Go Steelers is good. l like that. l love that. Let's use that from now on. Go Steelers. l never said l love you to a guy before. Yeah, me neither. Good talk. Can l get my ears pierced like Jenna's? You know we'll have to talk with mom. How come Chase is staying with us this summer? Why doesn't he spend summers with his own family? Brian says it's probably because his parents hate him. That's not true, pickle. See Chase-- Well, his dad died when he was just a little boy, and he doesn't really get along with his mom, so this summer we're like his family. Can l please get my ears pierced tomorrow? We'll talk about it in the morning. Okay. - Good night. - Good night. Hey, hey! We're just playin' for fun Chase. You don't have to get so close. l forgot to tell you. My grandma invited us all over for the weekend. Oh, yeah? Had my fill of social gatherings after the barbecue. l think l'll just stick around here. Alright. It's pretty fun though. We start drinkin' at breakfast over there. So, what's the deal? You're all the sudden scared to be naked in front of a heterosexual or something. Whatever, dude. l'm not scared. Why are you being so prissy with that towel then? Why are you watching how l dry myself? l'm not. lt's just you usually parade around, jingling your jangles all over the place. lt's hard not to get an eyeful. ls it different now? Between us? No, l'm just saying...usually. l'm just thinking of all the times-- So, it is different. Kinda. Sorry to interrupt your programming. The show's back on schedule! l don't want it back on schedule. l still got the reruns playing in my mind. You want it you got it, pa'lly. l don't want it! l want it to stop! l'm pointing out the difference. l like the difference. The parade's back on, rain or shine. l don't want the parade. What does gay mean? Who told you that word? Mom, it's not a bad word. l never said it was. l asked her where she heard it. Brian said he thinks Tyler and Chase are gay. Brian? What does he know? He's like eight. l'm eight. l know, Birdy. But gay is not a bad thing, okay? So what is it? Well, sometimes a guy will fall in love with a guy. Or a girl will fall in love with a girl. That means they're gay. Okay. l love Jenna my tennis coach. Am l Gay? No! You could be. But you probably aren't. lt has to do with love and... and other stuff, Birdy. Like sex? Oh, Lord. lt's okay, mom. l know. Jeffrey told me all about it. l'm sure he did. But how do two boys do that? Remember our rule to not talk about golf? l'm changing that. We can all talk about golf. Especially tonight, with your Grandmother. And after the weekend, Birdy, we're both gonna Iearn how to play. Oh, yeah, Mom. That's great. There's nothin' straighter than two lady golfers. Hey, Chase. Nathan. You wanna grab some dinner later? l can't cook like Stacey, but l'm pretty mean with the barbecue. Barbecue sounds good. Alright, just come by when you're ready. See you in a bit. Well, sweetheart-- l saw Jeffrey's penis. You did? They're weird looking, aren't they, Birdy? They look squishy. Sometimes they are. Mom. Please. She's gonna find out one day. Besides, there's nothing wrong with a little education. Hey, you're right on time. l hope beer is okay. Yeah, perfect. Did you hang out with Jarod today? What? Well, you're friends right? l saw you at the barbecue the other night. Oh, right. He's-- Chase, Tyler told me. Right. l figured he would. Were you scared to tell him? Yeah. l mean... you never know how people are gonna react, right? Yeah. So...how about you? Things were different l should stop talking. Steaks look good. You know what? You should probably go. Okay, Birdy. Let's go. We're leaving. Come on. Why we have to leave early? Grandma's is always so fun. Yeah, it's a riot. Hey, l was just making a sandwich. You want one? No. Chase, l think that l'm... l know. Everything's gonna be okay. l don't have anyone to talk to. lt's alright. l'm here. That's good. [laughing] That's good. lt's good. lt is good. Man, you are good looking. You're not so bad yourself. Do you want to go for a swim? Yeah, let's do it. Are you here? l'm here. Twenty-five years l've been waiting to feel like this. Thank you. lt's alright? lt's better than alright. (car door slams shut) Shit. Someone's here. You're back early. l love my mother, but one night is enough. You're shivering. Out of hot water? Yeah, l'm just checking the pilot light on the hot water tank. Hey. Hey. What's up? Nothin' - just, uh, swimming. Yeah, night swim. l love coming out for a night swim. How was the weekend with my dad? lt was good. Kind of boring, l'm sure. A lot of golf talk. You should have come to my Grandma's, man. We started drinking - she had mimosas by nine, wine by eleven. Look at this place. lt's crazy out here, right? Totally. l'll race you in. Chase! Good morning. Can you come here for a minute? l wanted to talk to you about something. Okay. When were you gonna tell me? lt must have been terrible to feel you had to keep it a secret like that. l'm sorry for what l said at the barbecue, Chase. l hope you can forgive me. Have a good day. You too. Honestly, at this rate we'll never get to eat breakfast! We can't eat until it's finished! l don't know, Birdy. Just because l go to college, doesn't make me smart. You should ask your father. He'll probably know. Ask him what? Dad, what's a 10-letter word for bond? Hmmm... lnvestment? lnvestment doesn't work. Okay, l gotta go. l'm gonna be late. l need to get Chase. He's been working on that painting 24/7. l'm gonna take this to go. Let me make you up a plate. What are you doing today, Dad? l've got to do some paperwork and then play a round of that game we're not allowed to mention. l still need a 1 O-letter word for bond. Try commitment. C-O-M- Is that one M or two M's? l've changed the rule. What's this? It's two M's, kiddo. M-E-N-T. lt works, Daddy! You got it! We can all talk about golf - as much as we want. Golf, golf, golf! Balls, balls, balls! l've been thinking, maybe it would be good for you to spend some time with Chase. He's gay. l know. Tyler told me. Did you talk to him about it? Yeah, a little. l just think he needs all of our support right now. Okay, yeah. l'll talk to him. Golf, golf, golf! Balls, balls, balls! Golf, golf, golf! Balls, balls, balls! Chase! Hey. Where's Tyler? He's working on the back nine. Do you have a minute to talk. We're kind of talking right now. You know what l mean. Nathan, stop. Didn't daddy ever ask you to come play? No. When one man and one woman are married to each other sometimes they need some time apart. That's what golf does for your dad. And his car and the office. Well, l have my scrapping and l love to cook. Wait here for a minute. Birdy! Grab your golf clubs. Let's go. We're leaving. Nathan, not here. Okay? You're probably right, but l can't stop thinking about you. What were those men doing in the bushes? Probably looking for a lost ball. How was your day? Good. Yours? Fine. How's Chase? l think he's gonna be okay. Mmm... How about you? Are you gonna be okay? l don't know what you mean. Really? What's this about? You asked me to spend more time with Chase. What are you so upset? l'm not upset. Stacey, you're half drunk. l saw you. Excuse me? At the golf course, with Chase. l saw you kiss him. What else have you done? Nothing. Don't lie to me, Nathan. This is... Crazy? Are you about to call me crazy? l am a perfectly sane woman dealing with completely irrational behavior. ln case you've forgotten, this is our life you're toying with. Now tell me what happened. What you saw with Chase was an accident. An accident? lt didn't mean anything. Cheating on your wife? That is not an accident. Have you always liked men? No...yes. l don't know, Stacey. Are you gay, Nathan? l don't know. Yes you do! Are you? Yes. But l loved you. You know what l mean. Actually l don't. That is why we're having this heart to heart. Why did you marry me? And you knew that you'd be living a lie? This hasn't been a lie. What happened with Chase - it was the first time. l've never been with a man before. So you chose a boy. Stacey. Your son's best friend to experiment with. Stop. No, l won't stop! l tried in vain to be the perfect wife, but it didn't matter, did it? Don't you understand, Nathan? l don't care that you're gay. l chose this life with you and everything that comes with it. Why didn't you talk to me? Stacey, l just couldn't. lf you knew all along, why didn't you leave me? Because l love you, Nathan! l thought eventually you'd tell me and l could tell you it was alright, that l don't care that we could keep everything we have and we could just go on-- Pretending. But you slipped. l'm sorry. It just happened. l didn't plan it. What are we going to do? l don't know what we're going to do, Nathan, but l know that l'm going to start by telling Chase he's leaving. Stacey, don't, please. Let me handle it. Handle what? Hey, Mom. What's for dinner? Everyone's on their own tonight. Okay. (crying) Hey. Nathan, look l've been thinking-- Chase... Stacey knows. She saw us this afternoon on the golf course. Shit. Chase, this isn't your fault. lf l had come out none of this would be happening. lf Tyler finds out-- He won't. l'll fix this. l don't even know what l was thinking. lt's okay. What about you? Are you gonna be okay? As good as l ever was - maybe even better. Thank you. Dad? Son! Tyler! Tyler, it's not what it looks like. Then what is it? Hey, this isn't his fault! So it's your fault! Who is that?! l don't know who that is! Tyler, l can explain! Don't fucking touch me! That's enough! What are you doing? Why would you do this? Why is everyone yelling? Why wouldn't you just leave, Dad? Because your mother was pregnant. So it's my fault? Nothing is your fault, Tyler. So this, all this, this is just- my family, my parents... it's just a lie? lt's not a lie, Tyler. l love you, l love your mother. l just had other feelings. So my best friend's a fag and suddenly my dad's a fag? l know this is difficult for you, Tyler. Why are you sticking up for him? Why don't you kick him out? Birdy! l'm hungry. Alright, sweetheart. How about some pie? l think we all should have a piece of pie. Hey, kiddo. Are you okay, Daddy? Pie, huh? l like pie. This is... Dad, this is bullshit. l like it. l'll have Tyler's piece. Well, l'm sorry, but l still can't believe this. Anybody call Jerry Springer yet? Honestly, man, l don't even know how it got to that place. Are you sure it's okay if l stay here? Well, you won't be staying with Tyler anytime soon. You're not the only one who made a mistake. Hi, Mom. How'd you sleep? Not so good. lt's gonna be fine. So much for the perfect family, huh? Perfect is overrated. l just don't know how l'm gonna look at him again. He's having a hard enough time looking at himself. But he's still your dad. Did you know? You can't blame a person for who they are. Hey, Chase. Where did Chase go? He's gone to stay someplace else. Did he and Tyler break up? Tyler and Chase were never dating. But they loved each other. l could tell. They loved each other like good friends. And right now there's some issues they need to work out. Because Daddy kissed Chase? Yes, Birdy... because Daddy kissed Chase. Have you seen him yet? Who? Come on, man. lt's been over a week. l'm pretty sure l'm the last person he wants to see. lt's not going to get better all at once but you gotta start somewhere. l think this is one of those things that just doesn't get better. l mean, what's the worst that's gonna happen? Tyler's here. Chase beat you in by an hour again today. We're not supposed to be here until eight. He's been here at seven every morning working on the back nine. Where you gonna be today? Anywhere but the back nine. - Hey. - Hey. So l shot an 81 yesterday. That a boy. l finally shot a par on number eight. l know that's the hole you were having trouble with. Yeah. Have you talked to Chase yet, son? No, there's nothing to say. l know what l did was stupid. Okay, really stupid. What happened with Chase wasn't his fault. And it doesn't change the fact that l love you very much, Tyler. lt's killing you, isn't it? Obviously. Well, l can tell. You haven't tried to make out with me yet and we've been here ten minutes. Bre, l can't stop thinking about it. lt's like ingrained in my mind. Why would Chase do that to me, right? What the hell was he thinking? What was my dad thinking? They obviously weren't thinking. So that makes it okay? Tyler, this isn't about you. Try to imagine how hard it must have been for your dad. Maybe Chase was supposed to be here this summer. And if your dad is gay, he still deserves to be happy. How can my dad be gay? Chase and your dad are still the same people. Why though? Why would Chase do that to me? l can't answer that Tyler. Maybe you should ask him. - Well, we can still make out. - Yup. l know you've made sacrifices and so have l but Birdy is only 8 years old and she needs both of us. So we can't make any promises. All we're gonna have to do is try. l'd like that. Thank you. l'm thinking what it would be like to see you with another person. lt would be pretty weird, wouldn't it? l guess even though l suspected you might be gay, when you told me we'd still be together l didn't think that meant we'd be with other people. l guess that wouldn't be fair, would it? Not to either one of us. l mean you deserve to be with someone too. l can't even think about that. l love you, Stacey. You know that, right? l know. l just can't imagine what our life is gonna look like. Will we still live together? Do we get separate rooms? Maybe you should go home at the end of the summer and l should stay here. l don't think we have the answers to those questions yet. We need to be there for Birdy. And the rest... l think we take it a day at a time. Looks great. lt's gettin' there. No, it's there. But l'm feeling for some beach right now, what do you say? You ready? Yeah, let's do it. Alright. Meet you out front. Tyler, l'm sorry. lf mom and dad break up, l'm scared l'll never see them again either. Well, they might not split up - they might stay together. They don't know yet. They're still talking it through. l think that's what you should do with Chase. Everyone! Come look! So you're going, aren't you? l just need to figure this out. And you need space to do it in, l know. l guess we need to tell the kids. Come here, kiddo. l don't want you to go, Daddy. We will see each other all the time, l promise. Where you headed? Bus stop. Jarod called me. Hey. l love you, son. l love you too, Dad. See you, Dad. Jarod called me. l thought he might. Well, my, uh... my dad left. l'm sorry, man. Yeah, me too. But l know now it's not your fault. Thank you. Okay, enough of this sentimental crap, right? l'm terrible at it. You don't do too bad. Really? Well, yeah... for a straight guy. Hey, that's good to know! Well, uh... take care of yourself, man. You too. Hey... Go Steelers, right?
