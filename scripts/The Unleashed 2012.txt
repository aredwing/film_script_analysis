The talking board is yet another tool to inspire hope that a world beyond our own can be reached. The question is this; are the dead taunting the living? Or is the living taunting the dead? Cleanse your thoughts of any fears you might have. What presence is in here with us now? C B. What's C B? When channelling, you must open your mind to whatever message the spirit is trying to convey to you. Great deal of energy is being used to communicate with us. Sometimes the letters are not in the right order. Or words are spelt to sound out what's being said. C B C B. Sabrina. A name? Yes. Sabrina was my aunt. She passed away five years ago. C B was my nickname for her. But how? Spirit. Are you Sabrina? Charles' aunt? D T G. Oh. This doesn't make any sense. What's happening? D T G. Oh. This doesn't make any sense. What's happening? Sabrina. Stay with us. This is it, spirit goodbye. What happened? What was she trying to do? That wasn't her. Sometimes, when speaking with one spirit, another attempts to come in. And the project goes to traitors as it just did. Must always end the session. What does it mean when it does that? It open a portal between the two realms, some spirits want back in. Into what? Life. I see. Does anyone else know of this board? No. Spirit I often speak with help fashion this board with me. I've been using it for more than half my life now. Where can I acquire one like it? I think we're about done here Charles. The mark of the devil. Evil. Not again. Go back from whence you came demon. The damned are not welcome here. M R S. B C K D N T G. Don't go back. Why? growling sounds ( Growling): Get out of me. I surround myself with protection. I release the evil that's been invoked. Release all energies that are not of the purest and highest power. I ask for forgiveness. Please. Hear my voice. White light. Please. Hear my voice. My board. Where's my board? Do you believe in ghosts? Tens of thousands of people from every culture, every period in human history have claimed to see them under the same circumstances. Now, most of these sightings are described the same way. Often the figures are shadowy and translucent. Sometimes disembodied. There may be a torso here, there may be a floating head there. I heard a report once about a floating arm. Which, is kind of helpful if you need a hand in the kitchen. Audiences Laughs Okay, sorry. But when we capture these images, are we actually seeing a recurring event from the past? Are they maybe a mirage of that beautiful oasis that lies beyond? Now mediums, clairvoyants, and psychics will convince you that only they have the ability to contact the dead. What's the proof? I think it's here. The magic talking board. Now, movies and TV shows will tell you that the spirits can enter our bodies and they can seize our souls via this board. However, it's a game that's sold in every major toy store in the country. Yes. Where did the name come from? Ouija was first patented by a man named Charles Kennard in the early 1900's. He claimed that the board itself told him Ouija was the Egyptian word for good luck. It wasn't. It was just a really great marketing ploy. Over time, the company fell into the hands of William Fuld who was his former foreman. Yes. What about the idea that a Ouija board is just the game of the mind and someone is consciously pushing the pointer around? Well, I think that's probably true about 90% of the time. Ouija's very powerful, psychologically. People are dedicated to the idea that they might be able to reach their loved ones again. But, for example, boy plays with Ouija with his friends, the predication says he'll die in six months. Six months later he dies in a car crash. Now, is that a coincidence? Or the fulfilment of a prediction? So you're saying we create coincidences? I'm saying I want you to think about that other 10%. I want you to remember those ghost stories told around the campfire, you know, the family folklore about visits from Grandma. I want you to bring that information back to class tomorrow so we can move a little further forward on our journey. Music squeeching Sound Phone rings Hello? (From Phone ) Madison Kennard? Yes. Hi, I'm Linda, the real estate agent. I was also a good friend of your mother's. Right. I'm so sorry for your loss. I was at the funeral. Sorry you couldn't be there. Anyway, I'll come by two days from now with the deed and go over the details of selling. That'll give you some time to go through the house and see if there's anything you want to keep of your mothers. Phone disconnects Linda? Sound of door opening the steps squeek Walking sounds from above Whispering sounds Madison fucking Kennard, fucking shoot me. Oh my god. Oh my god. You look like an actual goddamn person. Like, you look like a legit adult. Holy shit. What, what did Europe do to you? You don't have a piercing on your face. Holy shit. You actually grew up. I missed you so much. I told you you'd be back, didn't I? Yeah, not eight years later but, yeah. Well, I didn't think it was going to be exactly like this, but. Well, this is. Did you go? I did. Were there a lot of people there? I'm really sorry you couldn't be there. I hadn't talked to her in eight years, it's not as if she wanted to see me while she was alive so. Bullshit. She loved you. Obviously, she wanted you to have the house. This whole thing with your Dad. It's just got to end. This has nothing to do with my Dad. Besides, I'm not keeping the house, I'm just here to clean it up so I can sell it. Okay. We both know you're here for way more than that. Okay. I get it, I'm sorry, it's too soon. But I miss you and I want to get in as much time as I can so, can you do me a solid and let me stay here? Cliff and Rick are coming by tonight to say hi. That's nice. Oh my God. I used to love this house when I was a kid. You know, I'm going to get my own house soon. Really? Moving out of Cliff's place? Whatever happened to your other half there, um, what's his name again? Julian. Julian. What happened? Well, he took up cheating and I took up smoking and so the relationship just wasn't healthy. Anyway, it's no big heartache. Seriously, it's all good. Do you think it's still haunted? What? You know, ghosts. Noises. Shit that used to keep you up at night? You used to talk about it all the time before you left. Really? I forgot. I always felt like I was trapped in this house. Trapped? What do you mean? Like I would die here or something. Maddy. That's fucking morbid. So, what time are Cliff and Rick coming by tonight? Probably around eight. So you're really moving out of Cliff's place? He's a slob. Brother like sister. Shut up. You would love to have me here. Besides, it's only going to be until I find a new place. Your shit's already here, isn't it? Shhhh. Shhhh. Your reservation is for the entity room. You understand that there have been disturbances in that room. That's why I'm here. You people are always too curious for your own good. Always looking for a little adventure, aren't you? Ah, not really. If I could have the key now? What is it about danger that makes you people want to mess around with it so much? Ah, I can assure you I don't want to mess around with anything. If I could just have the key if that's all right? The shadow usually stands in the window around three A.M. Sometimes it moves through the room, but mostly it just stands in front of the window. People have been pushed in the shower. There are reports. Whispering. Cold spots. Cigar smoke. Poking. Excuse me, poking? The last guest that stayed in that room experienced an invisible entity poking him. Kept him up all night. Yes, well, it's kind of. And the blood. Blood? The blood in the bathtub. People have reported walking in there and finding the tub completely filled with blood. Uh, the key? I'm here all night. But I don't want no lawsuit if something happens to you. Maddy, I do love you. I think we should go on a date. You, me. Are you kidding me? Hey. Hi. Good to see you. Hey Maddy. Hi. Hey. Good to see you. Look at the happy couple. How are you? Good. Good, good. Hey Clifford. Hey. How are you buddy? What's up man? Good to see you. Ricky? How's things man? Good to see you. Manly drink. Ah, yeah. Party is here. My two favourite sisters in the whole world. We're your only sisters in the whole world. But, that's why I love you guys so much. Thank God I'm adopted. You're the lucky one. Wow, that's, that's awkward. Drinking beer again Cliff? Just one. Oh yeah, just one all right. One case. Hey, power up. Cheers. Rick, save your breath. You'll need it to blow up your date later. You just got told. Love you. Mayday. Mayday. Seriously, man. Like, crash and burn. It's got to be the hair. Has to be the hair. Either that or you're into farm animals or something. You know what's funny about that? Is I actually think that's the third time I've done it to him. He's relentless, I'm telling you, man. It's so funny. It's so nice to have laughter in this house. Remember when we were kids and we used to dare each other to run all the way to the basement in the dark without chickening out? Oh my God, yeah. And as I recall, I was the brave one. No you weren't. Yes I was.... What? Door Bell Hey. Alison, hey. I can't believe you're here. I'm sorry I'm late. I thought you were still in Italy. Oh. Uh, well, no, I was, but, um, something kind of happened and, well, I'm here, and I can't really leave until it's taken care of. Well, I'm so glad you're here. You know, I'm here temporarily myself. I know. Maddy, I'm really sorry to hear about your Mom. Oh, thanks, but, I'm all right. Go on in. Everybody's in the house. Yeah, well, I can hear Cliff's stories a mile away. Cliff. Two drinks for men and one for a child. Gasping Oh. So you following the Olympics? Yeah. You know what I hate though? What? When people bite their silver or bronze medal to see if it's real Why? Well, they did it in the old days to see if gold was real, because real gold is soft. ( Whispering voice): Amy. Amy. ... Amy. Amy. ...Amy. Scream!! Where's Amy? What happened? You're shivering. Amy. Amy. Amy. Let's get her out of here, let's get her downstairs. Yeah. There's something wrong with this house. Maddy. Hey. Hey. Don't worry, she'll be fine. It was probably just a cry for attention or something. Maddy. Maddy. Are you all right? I'm fine. Lightning streaks at Canon house. Mostly blue in colour but one is bright yellow. More ectoplasm at three different shots in the East Grange Cemetery. Nothing at the Bed and Breakfast. Is she all right? Guys, she's really shaken up about something. She won't say anything about what the hell happened up there. Should someone stay with her? No. She'll be fine. She's sleeping now. You look really worried about her. What was she doing up there? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You guys will never guess what I found upstairs. What is it? A Ouija board... Whoa. Cliff, where did you find that? The attic. You loose your nerve, Maddy? This shit used to never scare you before. No, put it back, I don't want any part of it. Come on. It'll be fun. It'll be creepy. It'll be very Halloweeny. You're a weenie. Cliff. Give me a break, buddy. Are you serious? You know these things are bullshit, eh? It's actually the people moving it around, not spirits. Dude, you've got, like, one functioning brain cell. Guys, what the hell is up with all of you. Play the game. It'll be just like back in the day, right? Running around naked in cemeteries is not exactly similar to playing with a Ouija board. I'm in. All right. Sadie, you're taking their side? Why wouldn't I? We loved this stuff. And you more than any of us was into this paranormal stuff, so, why wouldn't we play? What's the harm, really? We'll get some candles and stuff, it'll be cool. I'm not touching it. All right. I'm going to fine some candles. Party with the ghosts. You're okay with this, right? Sure. Just, just be careful, okay? I don't know about you guys, dude, it's not my thing. We don't care. I'm not playing. Really? I can get the lights for you. Turn off the lights. Handy Rick. Very good, you know. Okay. Okay. Now, I'm not an expert on this, but I think we need to say some sort of safety prayer to protect us from bad spirits or something. Does anybody have any suggestions? I suggest we just start asking some questions. I have two words. Captain Howdy. If he comes out of there, I am out of here. What was that? Captain Picard? You're such an idiot, Cliff. No, we need to say something like, um, protect us, oh Ouija. Protect us. Protect us and let us talk to the ghosts ...from beyond. Owe, it burns. It burns so bad. Okay, okay, very, very funny, but, you know, be careful, that was based on true events. Everything is based on true events. Close your eyes. Now, everyone place two fingers on the planchette. Now, no jokes guys. If it starts to move on its own, just follow it. Don't push it, okay? All right. (all) Okay. Everyone relax. We're just going to warm it up by moving it around in a circle. Oh, isn't that bad if it moves around in a circle? No. It's bad if the spirit tries to move it in the form of an eight. Or tries to slide it off the board. It means that the spirit's trying to set itself free, and that's how haunting and possessions happen. What? I obviously know something about the talking boards. Talking boards. Yeah. That's what they were called before they changed the name to Ouija. All right. Now let's stop, and position it in the centre. Is there anyone here with us from the spirit world? Is there anyone that would like to come in and talk to any of us from the other side? We welcome any spirit to communicate with us. Okay. Who did that? Okay, it wasn't me. Wow. I didn't do anything. Okay, it might have been real. Everybody put their fingers back on the planchette. Is there anyone there? Oh my God. Serious? Who's here? C F E D F E D C. That makes no sense. CFEDFEDC. A M A R A. Amara? Amara? What's an Amara? A name? Are you Amara? You should tell everyone to stop this now. Is there something you want to say to us? Guys. I think there's more than one ghost here. What? We can talk to more than one at a time? Okay, I think whoever was here is now gone. However many there were. M R X. M R X. Marx? I have no idea. Father or socialism? Or. Mr. X. Anyone know a Mr. X? Does it ring a bell with deceased relatives or anything? Are you hear to speak with anyone in particular? Oh. Oh. Somebody likes you. What do you want with Madison? What do you want with Madison? What do you want with Madison? Scream Get me the fuck out of this house. I can't fucking breath. Did you guys see that gash? That is freaky. Okay, guys, we're going to the hospital. Can somebody come with me? I believe we should have listened to Maddy. All right. I've had all the spooks I can take for one night. I have to go to the store tomorrow so, I'm going to head out. Linds. Linds. Lindsay. I don't want that thing down here, we have to put it back. Guys, I love what you're bringing into this class. I love your enthusiasm, I love the quality of your research. Keep it up. Just remember, when you're outside those doors, keep your curiosity and your eyes open, okay? And I'll see you tomorrow. Professor Curtis, I'm Andrew Porter. The writer. Yes, I wasn't aware you knew who I was. Small town. Did you get everything you needed from the seminar? I thought it was very informative. You and I share a lot of the same theories and beliefs on the subject. Oh, I don't think so. I don't think I could ever really just market my research and theories simply for money. Yes, well, that's unfortunate. Well, as you may know, my next book is in relation to the paranormal. Your next book? Yes, yes, it's primarily focused on some of the tools used in communication between, well, people and uh, ghosts. I seem to remember reading one of your books last year. I think it was called The Road to Nowhere. The Other Side. The Other Side... Yeah. And your research on, sort of, the spiritual ramifications of, life after death, it was just, so similar to my own. Yeah, well, you know, I'd like to ask you a few questions on some of the more common methods used to communicate with. Yeah, talking boards, table tipping, showy stuff, I get it. Yeah, well, with all the research I've been doing, I tend to get a lot of negative feedback on them. Specifically Ouija boards. I've yet to encounter a psychic or medium who can agree with them. So, I wanted to get your thoughts since you seem highly experienced with them. I do agree with the mediums. I am highly experienced. And I understand the dangers associated with using Ouija. Dangers? Can you tell me about them? Contact with the other side should never be attempted by those who aren't trained to do it. You're taking a huge risk. When people who have actually contacted the dead, now think it's a really bad idea, it's best to walk away from the subject all together. You ever seen a ghost Doctor? Do you have any idea what it feels like to have a cold presence flash across your face, as your eyes widen and your heart stampedes in your chest. And you want to grab a hold of something. You want to run, hide, scream. But not a part of your body will move. And then spend every day after that rationalizing your way back to sanity. In your classroom. Exactly. It won't open. What the fuck? Sounds of walking, Whipsers: Madison. Madison. Do you hear that? Yeah. Let's get the fuck out of here. Screams What the fuck are you guys doing? What the fuck are you doing here? We thought you left. Bringing you your keys. Oh, Jesus Christ. What are you guys doing up here? We're putting this away. I'm not going up there. I'm going to go clean. Fine, I'll take it up there. I'm going to bed. Whispering: Madison. Madison... ... Madison. Madison. ... Madison. Lindsay. ... Lindsay. Lindsay. ... Lindsay. Mr. X. Did you have a message for us tonight? What is it? Do you want me to help you? Let me help you. Chicken shit. Something kept blowing the sheets off of me. I couldn't sleep so I came in here. Okay. Nobody answers the phone around here? Come on in Cliff. What do you mean no one's answering the phone? The phone's not even been ringing. I have been calling for, like, the last 20 minutes. Well, you're obviously dialling the wrong number because this one's not ringing. Really. What are you making? Making scrambled eggs. Looks good. Thanks. Maybe, maybe not. No dial tone. What? Let me see. Oh. Well, well. Don't you look stunning. What a weird night. I had such weird nightmares. Well, sleeping with me does that to people. Besides, after last night, I think we all had nightmares. You seem to have slept fine. Yeah. I slept okay. Well, I was out cold. Like a diabetic bear in insulin shock, having a hibernation sleep. What? Oh my God. Anyways guys, there's so much to do today. There's so much crap in the other room we need to get rid of, so. Well, I only came by because you guys weren't answering the phone and I was worried after what happened last night. Yeah, and I'm sure you didn't come over to clean out Madison's fridge either. Of course not. I will go look at the phone box. Any idea where it is? Yup, I think it's in the basement. Okay. I will have three new eggs scrambled with a little bit of salt and pepper. Not the, I, I don't know what that is but, just like eggs, scrambled. Bacon. Make it yourself. A little bit of salt and pepper. So are you sure nothing strange happened last night? No. Like, you didn't feel anyone around you or something? No. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just bad dreams. No worries. Um, Linda, the real estate agent. Uh, she'll be dropping by tomorrow. Just to let you know. Okay? Okay... Cool. Bon apptit. What? I made it with love. Why the fuck did I volunteer my services for this? Because you love me. Screams What?... Spider. Why did you throw it at me? Kill it. Kill it... Oh my God... I'm serious, kill it. You're such a chicken shit. Oh my God. It's still on there. Jerk.... Amazing. What are you looking at? What are you looking at? Excuse me. Whoa. These are really old, I'm actually afraid to touch them. Freak. They're, like, antiques. Be careful with them. I think that's my grandfather. Oh my God, look at this. Do you think that's Charles? Yeah. Check it out. That is so cool. No kidding. What else is in here? This picture's odd. Why? Look at it. Tell me if you see something weird. No, I don't see anything... What? Lindsay, can you help me move this please? I really need you to help me. Lindsay. Lindsay. Lindsay. Hey. Lindsay. What? Your eyes. Your goddamn eyes. Okay. I'm going to get you an Advil, or a fucking joint or something. I'll be back. I'm losing my mind. Welcome to Grandpa Bill's House of Zen, and no, we do not perform exorcisms. No, we don't brew potions and the Kama Sutra's in the aisle closest to the window. Um, no, I'm not. I'm just going to go. No, no, don't do that. What can I do for you? I'm looking for information on the Ouija board. Ah, the infamous talking board. There's some cheap ones on the shelf over there. That won't be necessary. I have one. I just, um, want some information on it. I just want to know more about it. See if there's anything special about it, specifically. Right, okay, for like a thesis, a documentary or some shits and fucking giggles. Raina, watch your goddamn mouth. Grandpa, shut up. Complete embarrassment, sorry. Uh, it's for personal use, I guess you could say. Well, shoot. I, like, know my shit. All right, um, well, my friends and I were playing with the Ouj, sorry, I mean talking board the other night, that I found in my attic. Um, it's old and, you know, kind of mystical looking and uh, ever since we used it, these unexplainable things started happening. And now I have this constant fear that we released something or, or interfered with something and, I don't know, I just sound completely insane. No, no, not at all. Come here. What does the board look like? It's round. Um. Dark oak wood. It's about this big and uh, numbers on it are roman numeral. Holy shit, that's fucking cool. Raina!! Seriously Grandpa, take a nap or some shit. Raina, mind your manners. You don't pay me enough to mind my shitty manners. Here. Page 33. Watch yourself lady. Whoa, so, apparently the old man thinks you have one of the original boards ever made. I mean, if that's even possible. That's freaking awesome. I mean, you could contact real friggin' spirits, not like the cheap novelty boards they sell. That's the problem. Well, yeah, I mean, you got to be careful. Do you know what kind of spirits you could contact? I'm guessing not the good ones. Yeah, definitely not. The popular belief is that there's a series of stages you go through when you die. First, the realization that you're dead. Second, the acceptance that you've moved on, and then there's the ultimate decision of whether you stay on Earth or not. Stay on Earth, you mean, like, continue to live? Not in that sense. You either choose to go to whatever your Heaven is, or you stay on Earth in the spirit world. So, people actually choose to stay. Yeah, I mean, if, if they feel like they don't deserve their heaven yet or, or refuse to let go of their worldly self. So, what then? They're stuck on Earth? Yah. Unless you retain your redemption. See, the problem is that once spirit's feel the power of being an invincible being, it quickly corrupts them and they forget why they're there in the first place. The point is, the only spirits that can come through the Ouija boards are the ones that stay. And, I mean, they're fucking angry, you know, they've been summoned by a group of strangers, they have no idea why, and now they're just waiting. I read somewhere about possessions. Does that really happen? Yes. Um, mostly by the spirits who can remember why they're still there and can't do anything about it. I mean, this shit is super dangerous. Raina. Close up. Get out of here. That's fine, I was just going home anyways. Wait, wait. Here, why don't you take this with you and just bring it back when you're done. Thanks. Excuse me. Hi. I couldn't help but overhearing your conversation inside. I'm Andrew Porter. Madison Kennard, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So you're into Ouija boards. I happen to be writing a book about them. Would I be able to ask you a few questions, maybe? Over coffee? Well, I was on my way home. But, yeah, I have a little time. (voice from above): Lindsay. Hello? (voice from above): Lindsay. ... Lindsay. Hello? Lindsay. Hello? Thanks. So, you are a descendant of Charles Kennard. I mean, I've read so much about him. I can't believe that I'm sitting here with you. I read that the house was here in town and it's why I'm here, actually. Uh, I wanted to meet the owner. I guess that's why I feel like I already know you. Believe it or not, I feel the same way. I don't normally have coffee with complete strangers off the street. Well, believe it or not, neither do I. I should warn you though, um, the house is not going to be mine for long. I'm actually in the process of selling it. Seriously? I mean, your family built it, didn't they? I don't want to pry but, why are you selling? I'm sorry. You don't have to answer that. So, um, how did you come to be so fascinated with the talking board? Well, um, I guess I became fascinated with it when my wife died. I'm sorry. That's okay, I can talk about it. It happened on her last investigation. She became ill that night and, she never did tell me why she became ill or how she became ill. I thought it was a bug at first but, she changed. She began acting differently, becoming less and less active. Two weeks, she was bed-ridden. And you know, not one Doctor was able to. They said it was unexplainable. She had a severe case of depression that she just couldn't get out of. Wow. I'm sorry. That's incredibly scary. (whisper): Lindsay. ... Lindsay. Lindsay.... ... Lindsay. Lindsay. Well I guess you can say I became obsessed with the occult. Black magic. Ouija. You name it. I was more curious than anything and it killed me not to be able to help her. My thought was that maybe she used it alone. There were people there that night that said that they saw it. And from what I've learned and, and read and, and experienced, those things shouldn't be done alone. Is that why you write your books about death and the afterlife? Yeah. It's definitely taken its toll on me though. I've seen more than I care to when it comes to death. You know what, I really should get going. Is something wrong? No. Look, you may have a point about something and I just really got to go home. Okay, well, I'll come with you. That wouldn't be a good idea. I'm sorry. Madison. If something's wrong, I might be able to help you. Did you leave her alone? Shit. Lindsay. Lindsay? ... Lindsay? Lindsay, are you here? Jumpy, are we? Creepy basements do that to me. I can see why. Let's try upstairs. Yeah, okay. Lindsay. Stop. What is the matter with you? ... Maddy. What's the matter? ... Maddy. Maddy, what's wrong with me? crying How's she doing? She's sleeping now. Madison, I don't want to alarm you, but I found something in the basement. Today, I made my wife collapse in tears. I have no idea why but it is as if I cannot help myself. There is something inside of me. It is controlling every aspect of the man I believe to be. This rage and angst that consumes me is not my own. A month has passed since I patented this dreaded board and yesterday was the third funeral that had occurred in my family. I can only believe that I have brought a curse upon myself and the one's I love. If you need anything tonight, here's my card, give me a call. Okay. Thanks. Um. Goodbye. Hey. Are you okay? I'm fine. I'll, see you tomorrow. Cliff, hey. No, I'm fine. But your sister, um. No, she's sleeping right now. I just need you to do me a favour, if you can. Yeah, she's staying with me for a few days. Yeah. Listen, she's not doing too well and I was wondering if you can, if it'd be all right if you spent the night here. Yeah. Okay, I'll see you in a bit. Lindsay? What are you doing there? Are you feeling better? You're freezing. I'll get you a blanket. Cliff. What's wrong? Where's Lindsay? Linds? Are you okay? What happened? Cliff. I'm fine. I'm fine. I just feel a little bit off, but a good night's rest and I'll be fine tomorrow. No, I think I want to take you to the hospital. No, Cliff, I don't need to go to the hospital. I just need to go to sleep. Are you sure? Yes. Okay. I'm going to take you to bed then. Okay. Okay? Let's get up. She's going to be okay, right? Spiritual beings that are summoned to our world with such tools are bound to the very person or tool they have been summoned to until the mediator of the tool asks them to leave. Failure to send off the summoned spectre will bound the being forever unless the mediator executes the send-off. Such beings will, over time, become more and more present in our world. Hey. You haven't gone to bed yet? You have an incredible knack for making my heart stop. I have that effect on women. Well. I'm going to bed anyways. Hey. Before you go. When I went into the basement this morning, I saw something burned into the back wall. It looked like one of those witchcraft pendulum thingies. Like a pentagram? Yeah. What's up with that? Piano Playing Andrew. Piano Playing, violine Piano Playing, Piano Playing, violine (whisper): Andrew. Daddy? I need to talk to you. I've been having these dreams. More like nightmares. Ever since I moved back into the house. What's wrong with your head? Ah. I thought they were just dreams at first but after the one I had last night, I realized that they were more than just dreams. They're more like signs. Andrew, I think whatever's going on with Lindsay has something to do with that old woman in my nightmares. You don't have any bandages? Ice? Freezer. I feel like I know her from somewhere. Like I've seen her somewhere before. I don't know. I need to find out why she's taunting me. Mr. X. She's Mr. X. Wait a minute, what did you say? There's more to this house than I realized. I need to find out what the hell is going on. Do you know what she looks like? Yes. Library. Lindsay. Lindsay. Lindsay. Any luck? Not yet. Typing Amara Xavier. Marcus R. Xavier. Mr. X. Hows it going? Anything? Yeah. But I need to get back to the new-age store. Why? This, this is the old woman in my dreams. I think they can help me with something. Im just going to print this out first. Okay. Look, I feel like Im dragging you into this, you really dont have to come. Hey. Are you all right? Youre sweating. I m fine. Look, Im with you on this one okay? Just, God knows you dont want to do this on your own. Yeah, but this is only getting more dangerous. All the more reason to make sure theres someone there for you. Yeah. Okay. Lets go. We need your help. Okay. Do you know the name Amara Xavier? Here, I have a picture of her. Is this a joke? Are you kidding me? No, not at all. I dont think you actually understand exactly what could happen. Never mind, most importantly, what you could be bringing here. Amara Xavier is not some fairy tale myth with a happy ending, okay? Shes some serious shit. And every one of these books describe the terror she inflicted in everyone she knew when she was alive, and not just her but her husband and his mistress. Shit. So what do I do? What do you do? Um, I dont know, pick a God to pray to? I dont even know where to start. Okay, Amara, she was infamous in Deep Creek Mountain, the town she lived in, in the late 1800s. Her and her husband, they lived in a cabin completely removed from the town, and there are documented details on how they used to practice certain types of black magic. And where the problems really occurred? Her husband, he took up a mistress. Amara found out and she lost her goddamn mind. The mistress went missing and her husband, he died of a mysterious snake bite a few days later. She murdered the both of them. Well, yeah, thats the belief. But nobody could prove anything so she was never convicted. Were there any children? There is one book that documents she had a child. But he drowned at the age of seven. And Amara, were there any accounts of what she did after he died? She was alone. She had no children, no husband, she had to make a living for herself. She knew how to connect with the spirit world so she charged people to do so. Hello? Madison? Madison? Madison? Madison, its Linda. Is that you up there? Cliff... Linds. Maybe Cliff took her back to his place. No. His cars still in the driveway. Linds. Cliff. Ill check down here. I told you to stay away from it. Why didnt you listen to me? What are you doing here? Whats the matter? You have to bury that thing. Have you seen Lindsay? Its going to destroy you and everyone we know. Allison. Im telling you Madison, everybody is in danger. Wait. How did you get into the house? Madison. Dont be afraid of me. Im here only because I want to help you. Its not too late for you. But Lindsay. Why? Whats going to happen to Lindsay? Its already happening. If you really want to save her, you know what you have to do. Do what you have to do. Get rid of it. Allison. Allison. Oh my God, dont do that to me. You just about gave me a heart attack. You all right? No. Who were you just talking to up there? Allison. You didnt see her? No. I mean, I heard you talking to somebody but I didnt see you talking to somebody. (from Phone) Hello? Dan, hey, sorry to bother you. You know when Allison was over the other night? Allison? Yeah. Allison what, Clayton? Yes, Allison Clayton. You saw her too, right? Madison. You saw her too right? Dan, please say you saw her. Im going crazy. Madison, Im sorry, I know you were friends with her, I thought you knew about what happened. But you did see her. You were standing right next to her. No, I didnt see her. There were no survivors. It was all over the news last year. Theres no way Allison could have been at your house. We need to go. Hey. What about Lindsay? I cant find her. I need to find answers and I know this is where we need to go. What do you keep looking at back there? Everythings pointing us in this direction. Maybe whoever lives there now might be able to help us out. Yeah, that's if anybody lives there at all. House might not even be there anymore. Well, at the very least maybe we can look around and leave. Should I even ask? Jesus. Amara? Who is asking? My name is Madison Kennard. This is Andrew Porter. Kennard? Yes, Kennard. You had someone by the name of Charles Kennard in your family? He was my great-grandfather four times over. He came to see me once. A long time ago. He came to see you? Why? He came for the same reason that everyone else came to see me, and you're holding it in your hand. I believe that it was Charles that brought on the curse that I've been living all these years. So, what are you saying exactly? That he stole the board from you? Put a curse on you? I'm saying that the very board that you have in your hand is the very board that I created over a century ago. How can you still be alive? I am bound to the board that I am damned to. For unleashing an entity I should have left alone. Charles Kennard came to me for guidance and help. His interest in my methods of seeking the truth and answer must have overtaken his curiosity as it was after his visitation that it went missing. He stole it and patented it. My family is cursed? I put the curse to ensure that the board would one day come back to me. Why? Why would you want it back so badly? I needed to lay the evil that I unleashed to rest. Marcus, was filled with rage and hate. I was very young when I married my husband. It was not long after that, speculation of whether or not I could bear his children came about. I was informed I was barren. I tried everything within my craft to fulfil my duty as a wife and bear my husband children, but nothing worked. Eventually, Marcus discreetly took up with a young girl. The affair was soon to become anything but discreet. His scandalous behaviour defaced me and turned me into a public disgrace. I had to put an end to it. And what exactly did you do to end it? You killed them. You killed them both. I did what I had to do. Couldn't go on the way I was. Is what I've done wrong? I loved him. He loved her and why? Because she could produce a family for him? I wasn't about to let that happen. I had to put an end to the misery. Demon. There's a demon in her. Lindsay. Lindsay. You've been waiting for me, just as I had sentenced you to. How long has it been since you looked into my eyes, Amara? Was there a choice in waiting? Perhaps it is best that you see me face to face without hiding behind this young girl that stands before me. Lindsay. Lindsay. Are you okay? Andrew, help me. Get the board. What do you want from me? Retribution. What I did was my retribution. I gave you everything. I loved you. You repay me by betraying me with her. Your death was well deserved. Was it? You cursed me to live in hell for all these years. To torment my very existence. Waiting for you to make your way back to me. How can you resent me? For wanting you to love me. I saw the true evil within you the first day you presented me with your black magic and your dark witchery. I wanted nothing to do with it. I'm here now to end it. To end you. I always loved you. (whisper): Hey. Hey. Madison. Its okay. Theyre all gone. Youre going to be okay. Madison. Madison, please. Wake up. crying sounds Lindsay? Lindsay. Maddy. Im so sorry. Its all my fault. Please come back to me. I need you. Please. No. No. Lindsay, Im right here, look at me. Im right here, Lindsay. Im not dead. Im not dead. No. No. Screaming (voice over): Theres a series of stages you go through when you die. First, the realization that youre dead. Second, the acceptance that youve moved on. And third, the ultimate decision, on whether to stay.
