Depart then, transgressor. Depart, seducer, full of lies and cunning, foe of virtue, persecutor of the innocent. Give place, abominable creature. Give way, you monster. Give way to Christ, in whom you found none of your works. For he has already stripped you of your powers and laid waste your kingdom, bound you prisoner and plundered your weapons. He has cast you forth into the outer darkness, where everlasting ruin awaits you and your abettors. To what purpose do you insolently resist? To what purpose do you brazenly refuse? For you are guilty before Almighty God, whose laws you have transgressed. You are guilty before his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, whom you presumed to tempt. You are guilty before the whole human race, to whom you proffered by your enticements the poison cup of death. Amen. Is the cochan prepared? Expulsion is near. Therefore, I adjure you, profligate dragon, in the name of the spotless Lamb, who has trodden down the asp and the basilisk... and overcome the lion and the dragon, to depart from this woman and her unborn child, to depart from the church of God. And when he had cast you out, you did not even dare, except by his leave, to enter into a herd of swine. And now, as I adjure you in his name, begone from this woman and her unborn child- Please help me. Help me. Save me. My baby. Let me go. Depart then, impious one- My baby. Let me go. Please. Do what you know is right. For my baby. Everything's gonna be okay. Trust me. - - Father, please. The baby is coming. Help me. Please. Do whafs right! Yes. Yes. ...give place to the Lord Jesus Christ, who shed his most precious blood for man. She's going into labor. We have to help her. ...from whose sight nothing is hidden. It is he who repels you, to whose might all things are subject. Please, Father. Help me. Please. Do whafs right. Please, Father. What are you doing, Father? Father, you will always be a fool for the flesh! No! What have you done? MY wife. My baby. Good evening, Father. Evening to you, Elliott. [ Woman On PA j Lights out in 75 minutes. I'm Henry Davies. I'm the chaplain at Clovesdale. And my attorney tells me you're the guy to thank... for being transferred here instead of prison. It was nothing. I play basketball with the attorney general. I convinced him that you'd be.. best in a Catholic-run institution. Besides, it was you who had to accept the plea of insanity to make this work. Look. I received official notice from the Vatican, and, uh, I've been instructed to pass it over to you. You've been dismissed from your clerical state. By papal decree, no less. "From this moment forth, you are expressly forbidden from exercising ministerial functions. " Yeah. Sorry. I did all I could. So I'm no longer a priest. You understand the decree that's been handed down to you? Yes, I do. Very well. May God watch over your soul, John Barrow. John, I'm going to be retiring soon. Until I do, I'm gonna be saying mass every day in the chapel at 8:00 AM. You're welcome to join us. Thank you. Party hearty! Luckiest girl in the whole wide world, right? Cheers. Happy birthday! Whoo! Oh, my God. You guys, six years ago, I never would have thought... that I would be here, doing this on my birthday. Thank you so much. The youngest woman to make partner... deserves to let loose on her 24th birthday. Nobody anywhere has ever made partner below 30. Do you know how fortunate you are right now?

Let's go. Uh, Sam. You're bleeding. It's happening- What's happening? We're here. What did she say? We're here! Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for this day. Thank you for my being able to wake once again, to see and to hear this morning. Amen. Amen. I'm proud of you, Barrow. A man of lesser faith would have turned his back on God after what you've been through. Excuse me while I make my final rounds. Hey. What are you gonna do with all your free time once you've retired from this place? I'll be teaching at a local seminary, where there's a residency awaiting me. Besides that, what else? Drinking a lot of beer, playing a lot of basketball. Which you're welcome to do with me... when they release you from this place. Thanks. No! No! No! Hanley, Molly. You are being held here for a court-ordered evaluation. it's for your own good. How was last night, Mikey? And what about your own good? Janet Marie Jones. I Gutiural Voice 1 Janet Man's Jones. Everything okay? Janet, is everything okay? Do you want us to call someone? No. No. No. I'm, um- I'm fine. [ Gasping 1 Are you all right? I said yes. Get her processed, please. Now. Janet, what happened? Lights out. Keep it down in there! Shut up! Be quiet! Molly. Molly. Molly. Molly. Molly! [ ThumpiflQ 1 Molly. Molly. Molly. Molly. Molly. We're getting stronger. No! [Gasping 1 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, God. Excuse- Excuse me! Excuse me! Someone help me! Someone help me, please! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Somebody help me! Get out! Get out! Hello, Molly. I'm Dr. Laurie Hawthorne. I know who you are. I'll be meeting with you several times a week while you're here... for evaluation as we prep you for your future beyond these walls. You aren't scared to be in here with me? Should I be? You read the file? I have. Says here you had a complete and total mental breakdown- a breakdown that started on your 24th birthday. Is that right? We'll be evaluating you here with us for the next 30 days. I'm- I won't be here that long. What is it, Molly? Whatever it is, we're here to help you through it, to help you to the next stage. What do you mean, the next stage? Of your life. Molly, your father committed suicide in a mental institution... after he was found guilty of murdering your mother. How much do you remember of that? Does my file tell you... that my parents were also into the occult? Of course. I'm not insane, Dr. Hawthorne. I don't think that you are. I'm possessed. Molly, multiple personalities are- You think you can help me'? You have no idea what you're dealing with. Molly, I can only help you if you're- I had a counselor like you once. In high school. She thought she knew what was best for me too. She's dead now. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor. Doctor. Doctor! Doctor! Harileyfls counselor, Dr. Emerson, boyfriend, Joseph Young, were eventually found to have ties to the occult. Both were found dead in a bizarre double suicide... shortly after Hariley escaped from their cult... and moved to Michigan to start a new life. She did this. She brought him here. We need to do something. Molly, today I would like to talk about your past. I'd like to talk about the occult. I want you to know that I am not like them. You can trust me. I want whafs best for you. Do you know that, Molly? I'm here to help you through this. Molly? Molly? Molly, are you okay? What's happening? Oh! My master says hello. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trespass against us And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop! Stop it! Dr. Ham/theme, you've got to come see this. On my WHY Oh, my God. Molly? Molly. Molly! Molly. Stop! Molly, settle down. Hello, Molly. How are you feeling? I'm sorry I had to do this, but ifs for your own protection. You hurt yourself badly. In rereading the transcripts of your case, I was struck by something. You claimed that on your 18th birthday, you were essentially possessed by the devil. Correct? But you testified you believed that this was only the first phase. You quoted your school counselor, Dr. Emerson, the woman who betrayed you, as saying, "We have watched you grow. There are great things ahead. You are the one. " You said in court that you've come to believe that what she meant by that... was that you will be the one who will return Satan to this mortal coil. Is that correct? You believe your possession on your 18th birthday is like a pregnancy- a pregnancy you thought would come to term in your 24th year. Don't you see, Molly? Maybe this is some sort of psychosomatic self-fulfilling prophecy. You believed this would happen on your 24th birthday, so now your mind is willing it to be. And ifs manifesting physically with the vomiting and the noises. Why else would this- this possession need to incubate from 18 to 24? Can you tell me why, Molly? Molly? I have been thinking about it. And? It's because it's six years later. Six years, six months, six days, to be exact. But six months and six days after your 24th birthday- That's only a few days away. [ Growling 1 Stop. Molly, I can't understand what you're saying. I can't understand what you're saying, Molly. Stop it! Stop it! Molly? Molly. He's coming! "He's coming. " 7:06. 7:06. Sixth hour and 66 minutes. Father. Father. Please, Father. Please, Father. Help me. Wham you say'? Please. Please. Do whafs right. Hey, Barrow. Bedtime. Orderly! Molly? Molly. Code gray! Help! Help! We need restraints in here now! Help! Now! I'm coming! Excuse us, please. Father Barrow. I haven't been called that in a while. I need to talk to you right away. Of course. It's one of our other patients. Molly Hartley? Yes. I think she's possessed. Then what you need is a priest. I read that once a man is ordained as a priest, he's always a priest. What you need is a priest that's still ordained by the church. Things are happening. Unexplainable things. Can we talk somewhere else? I read that there are two types of exorcisms- solemn and unofficial. A solemn exorcism has to be approved by the church. An unofficial exorcism can be performed by a layperson. Someone's been doing their homework. After all the lawsuits and bad media attention, the Roman Catholic church no longer even teaches priests how to perform exorcisms. As of last year, there's only 17 trained exorcists in all of America. Including me. Including you. Yeah. And of those 17, only one has been involved in an actual exorcism. Me. You. You know the ritual of exorcism, Barrow. You no longer need approval. Think of this as your redemption. There's no such thing. Please. go to the cops. They won't believe me. Just take a look at her. This young woman, she needs you. She's in pain. We have no time. What about your freedom? You do this for me, I sign your release papers. Simple as that. It's not that simple. When did this happen? Last night at 7:06. How do you know that? Because all of the watches and clocks... stopped at that exact same time last night. Sixty-six minutes after the sixth hour. He's here! His time is near! His time is near! Save us! Everyone to their rooms. Lockdown in efiect. Mind if I have a moment to talk to the patient alone? Of course. Hello, Molly. My name is John Barrow. I know who you are, Father Barrow. I'm not an actual priest anymore. So stupid. Pardon me? Like bringing a knife to a gunfight. I'm not talking to Molly, am I? No. I'd like to talk to Molly. No Molly. Only us. Us who? "And he asked him, 'What is thy name?' And he answered, 'My name is Legion. "' - You know the Bible, I see. - The opiate of the masses? You know what happens next after that verse you cited? "There was nigh unto the mountain a great herd of swine. And forthwith, Jesus sent the demons into the swine. And the herd ran violently into the sea, and they drowned in the waters. " Yeah. Poor little piggies. But I like that very much. You do? Yeah. And now they sent a pauper for the prince! You're referring to the fact I'm no longer a priest. Dr. Hawthome told you that. The things they tell in the bowels of hell, Barrow. Call Johnny Milton. I just wrote another verse for his doggerel about me. - Paradise Lost. - Paradise now. Paradise right here and now. Paradise, right here, right now. Come here. Come here. I'll show you what I mean. [ Laughs 1 You cannot seduce me, demon. Oh, yeah. Is Molly in there with you? - I'd like lo talk to Molly. - Why, so you can help her? I would like to talk to Molly. So you can help her like you tried to help the others? What have you done? My wife! My baby! You're nothing but a failure, priest! I wanna see Molly Hartley. Please help me. [ Laughing 1 Did you enjoy that, Barrow? Was it everything you hoped for? She's stronger than you think. She's in there, and I'm gonna help her out. Ah! Was Molly an exceptional student? That's the thing. In high school, she was an average student. Nothing special. Then on her 18th birthday, everything changed. Wharton School of Business, straight A's. Graduated a semester early, magna cum laude. Hired on at a top financial firm shortly afterward... and made partner at 24. It's almost like she had some sort of helping hand along the way. What about in literature? John Mme", Paradise Lost? It's doubtful she'd have any of that knowledge. Not from business school, anyway. I have to review her high school academic file further. So what do you think? If you don't mind, I'd like to see somebody. Consult with. Confidentially, of course. Chaplain Davies. - They let you out? - Not exactly. What brings the prodigal son hereto me'? I think there's a patient at Clovesdale that needs an exorcism. I don't care if she spoke the entire Bible backwards in Aramaic. There's no way the church is going to approve an exorcism in this day and age. - I know. - Then what are you doing here? - Because in my experience, the girl is possessed. - So help her. But know what you're doing might have serious consequences. I know, but I'm not a priest anymore. Don'i have to be in the NBA to play basketball, right? Is your reluctance really to do with what happened last time? Yeah. It is. Wait here. I have something for you. I kept these for you, locked up down there. God, wash away the iniquities of this building and cleanse it from its sins, taking away all place of refuge for the dark one... as he's vanquished from your humble servant, Molly Hartley. Please, come to my assistance who you've created in your likeness... and who you've redeemed at a great price... from the tyranny of the devil. Why don't you untie me now? Are you gonna wait for the cock to crow three times, like that fool who founded your church? I'm with no church. I come armed only with the faith in the Lord that banished you to the bowels of hell. Most glorious prince of the heavenly armies, defend me in my battle against principalities and powers, against the rulers of this dark world, against the spirit of wickedness in the high places. [ Laughs 1 The supplicant's position. The perfect place for a meager servant. Do you want to kiss my ring? Or my lips? - You can have any of this! - Silence, demon. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, as it is now and ever shall be, world with no end. Amen. Why did you fail me, Barrow? Please, Barrow, stop this. This is no way to help your flock. - You know how this will end. - You can't fool me again, demon. You're not her. You're not her! Linvoke all God's virtues- h,B8HTWM! Against every hostile, merciless power... that assails her body and her soul, against the false laws of heresy, against the deceits of idolatry, against the art and the spells that bind the souls of every man and woman. Free Molly Hartley from your evil. Begone! In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Make place for the Holy Spirit in the name of the- Linvoke all God's virtues... against every hostile, merciless power... that assails her body and her soul, against the false laws of heresy, against the deceits of idolatry, against the art and the laws that bind the souls of every man and woman. Free Molly Hartley from your evil! [ Blows 1 Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses... as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. You keep your shit away from me! I cast you out, unclean spirit, along with every satanic power of the enemy, every specter from hell... and all of your fell companions... in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Begone! And stay away from this creature of the Almighty. Begone from Molly Hartley! The Holy Spirit commands you. The Holy Spirit commands you! The Holy Spirit commands you! The Holy Spirit commands you! God the Father commands you. God the Son commands you. - - God the Holy Spirit commands you. The blood of the martyr commands you. The continence of the confessor commands you. The devout prayers of every holy man and woman commands you. I'm here! I'm here! You can do this, John. You just have to believe. That's what I'm afraid of. What if my belief in God is outweighed by the fear of the devil? Not your belief in God or the devil. You have to believe in yourself. And in Molly. My hour's upon thee, Barrow. Today is the day. 666. Six years, six months and six days... since this stinking piece of flesh became impregnated with my spirit. You know what this is? it's time, Barrow. - Do you know what this is? - it's time for my birth! - Answer me! - "There was nigh unto the mountain... a great herd of swine. Forthwith, Jesus sent the demons into the swine. And the herd ran violently into the sea and drowned in the waters. " That's very good. Now you must know I'm going to cast you out of Molly, by the power of Christ, and send you into the swine. A pathetic cradle for a king. By the name of Jesus Christ, my God and my Lord, and strengthened by the power of my faith, I confidently undertake to repulse the attacks and deceits of the devil. Most cunning serpent, you will no longer dare to torment this young woman and sift her like wheat. God, use your mighty hand... to strike him from your servant, Molly Hartley. Begone! Begone! Begone! You must be Father Barrow. I'm Molly. Nice to meet you. You know I can't repay you for what you did for me, right? You don't have to repay me. Thank you. Good-bye, Molly Hartley. N Come in. It's done. You have me cochon. Give it to me. I'll put it in my safe until the ceremony. Thanks for all your help. it's nothing. You've done this ritual before? No. But I have confidence he will guide me. It's safe down there? Safe as anywhere else. What is this? It's the Sigil of Baphomet. it's the insignia of the Church of Satan. I've been prepping myself for the ritual. These symbols, what are they? Did they teach you nothing in seminary? I studied the removal of demons, not the celebration of them. Let's sit down. They're occult symbols that translate to "Leviathan. " Leviathan? L- V-T-Y-N. Leviathan. Members of the Church of Satan adorn themselves with the symbol. What is Leviathan? It's a version of their second coming. The beast rises from a lake of fire. Some people say it's the same creature as prophesied in Revelation. When Anton LaVey wrote the Satanic Bible, he broke it into four books. He named the fourth and final book, which deals solely with the beginning of end times, "The Book of Leviathan. " They think they can raise it? Yes. How? By the performance of an occult ritual... involving a contained spirit of the devil, along with the performance of the greatest sin of all- matricide. Matricide? The killing of the devil's mother. The woman it grew inside of. The woman it was birthed from. Molly Hartley. The cochon- I need to see it right now. I don't think we should disturb it until after the ritual. I need to see the cachon. I'll take that. [ Grunts 1 Hello? [Gas ' Helplplng 1 Help me, please! Please, let me go! I can't- [ Gasping 1 Wasps X Hello? Hey! Can you help me? Could you open the door for me? He only helps those who help themselves. I Banging I Help! Hello? Help! Hello? There you are. Dr. Hawthorne. He is here. He is here. Let me go! Let me go! Doctor. Elliott. Thank God you're here. I- There was no one at the front desk. I think I just got a prank call. After everything that's happened, I guess I just scared myself. Elliott? What's wrong? Elliott? Let's go, now. Where are you taking me? To bear witness to his birth. - Look, I- - To bear witness to his birth. Now. Take it easy. All right? Take it easy. Come, Lord of Darkness, and look favorably upon this sacrifice we have prepared in thy name. Restrain her! Here. My God. What is happening? [ Coughing 1 [ Grunts 1 Mighty Satan, we entreat you to accept this sacrifice... of your very own mother- the woman who bore your seed for 666, the woman who brought you to term- that you may return to us in blasphemy... as the books of heaven and hell have prophesied. Wasps X Release the devil's spirit! Hail Satan. - Hail Satan. Bring me the father. Wasps X wasps X Why you doing this? Being a lamb of God makes it easier to lead you to the slaughter. You. You killed those patients. Witnesses. And the devils father shall bear witness to it all. Devil's father? You are the one who birthed him from his mother... through your profane exorcism. Okay. All right, listen to me. Don't hurt her, okay'? These are the devil's spirit. And when they mingle with her slain blood- - No, hey. - the Leviathan shall arise! Lei her go! Wasps X Everybody back! Get back! Nobody move! Go to hell! You have all betrayed me! Get outta here! - Come on. - Let's go. Come on! Get up. Come on. Walt, wan, want, wan. No, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Freeze! Police told us Chaplain Davies... has been involved with this since you were born. The police found his records in the chapel. It has the names of all the cult members on it. You're safe now. I won't let you down again. I trust you, Father. Thank you, both of you. Just stop it!
