We must watch Rahul getting beaten up! We mustn't miss the show! Rahul! Open the door! Open the door! If you're a man, come out! Come out... open the door! Break open the door! We came here to kill and he has committed suicide! I said in an emotion I didn't mean to kill him. What shall we do now? Call police. His feet are moving, I think he's still alive! Hold him boys! Get a stool! Get up and loosen the knot. You call the ambulance. Remove the noose! Put him on bed! Rahul... get up! I'm sure Raja would bash him up! And we must enjoy Rahul's cries of distress... Move fast boys! Did you call the ambulance? Make it fast! Fast! You said they came to bash Rahul! It looks like a procession not bashing up someone.

Killing as well as saving is your right! Don't I've any right? I was dying, you came and saved me. First decide now, whether you want to kill me or save me! Decide and then do it. We came to kill you! - Fixed?- Fixed! If you change your heart again, I'll kill you, bloody idiots! Okay, kill me! - Kill him boys! Wait... wait... I've a small wish before I die! - What's it? Who broken open the door to save me? - Why? Nothing, I want to hug him, say thanks and die happily! It's me, Rahul! Hey Laddu! You're my true friend! You saved my life, thank you! What?- I saw your feet moving and said you're still alive. Was it you? Had you not said it, I would be dead by now! Dear... I love you dear! Great! I got you off the noose and brought you down. But finally one intelligent guy asked to call ambulance, his voice still echoing in my ears! Who is that big hearted man? Tell me... who is it? Is it you? It's me! Not you! Please tell me! - It was me! I asked them to call the ambulance! Not you... not you... - I swear it was me! Please tell him! - It was him! Are you so humane?

You'll board the same flight again, right? Collect it then. Take! I heard you talking to the air hostess. Take it, call your home.

It's 3 years since I've seen you, mother. Is dad still angry on me? You came to my marriage like guests. Priya is coming, if you also come, mother? We'll be together for sometime, mother. Just 3 days, mother! If you come to me only then you'll know if I've changed or not. You don't worry, I'll talk to your dad and bring him there. Bye son! What? Give me a coffee. - Make it yourself. Why are you so angry? - You're angry not me. It's you who keeps anger simmering for years. How many years have passed since you've seen our son? Anyway you're angry on your son, right?

Now, fourth time I'm in Goa unexpectedly, but can't go out to see! This time you're seeing Goa! Who you are with? What will you do? For the present I'll make a phone call. How are you buddy? How am I? Have you forgotten it? I knew you'd forget it. I'm getting married in 2 hours. I called you on phone, gave SMS, sent Email and invitation card too. But still you forgot it. I'm ashamed to tell that you're my friend. What's today's date? Which month? Want me to tell the year too! What happened? Stop... stop it! I should be shouting on you, why are you shouting on me? No use in inviting people to marriage, you must have the sense of receiving the guests. Buddy! Are you in Goa? Do you think I'm Goa because my Hyderabad flight got diverted? In 10 minutes, I'll send a car. Send immediately, hang the phone. In exam tension I forgot about his marriage. Had Jaya aunt been here, she would've killed me! Priya come, let's go to the marriage. To marriage? I must go to the marriage. You'll get bored alone here. Marriages are grand in Goa! I mean I don't drink but if you want... you'll get it! Fourth time you wish to see Goa is going to be fulfilled because of me. Come, let's go. Priya, take it as marriage in your home. Buddy! My friend! Have you come? Go away! - What happened? I'm going! Buddy! Why are you leaving immediately? What happened? What else? Did I forget your marriage? Look Priya, we came here after a great struggle to attend his marriage, and he says I've forgotten about his marriage, Please forgive me. With one word that I forgot your marriage, you have... Buddy!

Go... go... why are you coming in? Are you asking me to go away, aunty? I didn't come here for him but for you, aunty! You're good in apple polishing! Hasn't changed a bit! Who is that girl? My wife Priya! - Wife?! When did you marry her? - Are you married? What? When did you marry? What's this so suddenly? Very beautiful! You're very sweet! I think I'll cast evil eye on you! I can't believe it! Not only you, she too can't believe it. She's still in that shock! You could've at least informed me, right? I haven't yet told my mother too, aunty! Aunty, you must break this news to them. Aunty will support us fully! Okay? Okay aunty? I got it now! That's why you've come here. I'll take you to task later. You're standing in sun, come in. Come in... come in... Yamuna, come here. Rahul's wife! Aunty, I need to talk to Rahul. - Okay... okay. Nothing nephew, just on diet off late. I must go back to airport immediately. - Why? What happened? Why did you tell aunty that we're married? Oh that thing! I've a reason to tell like that. I don't want to hear your reasons, what did you tell me in airport? Didn't you promise to behave properly? I told you one more thing in airport. I promised you wonderful time in Goa, right? How is it connected with this? Just wait for 10 minutes, you'll understand it. If you don't understand by then, go to aunty, and tell her it's a lie! Okay? Arrangements are excellent! What do you think of us then? What nephew? - What? Somebody is calling you there. Come. What sari is this? Kanchi silk or Benares? Is it good? - Very beautiful, aunty. Did you design it yourself? - Come to the point. I bought many saris and jewels to Priya for this marriage. But my luggage is stuck in airport. You want your wife to appear beautiful in this marriage, right? Is that what you want, right? - As beautiful as you! Enough! Priya come, get ready! - No problem, aunty. Don't say no, don't feel shy with me. Watch out! How I'll dress you up! Come! Come! One minute aunty! - Don't talk, sit here. I bought many dresses for my daughter-in-law. Aunty, I want to tell you something. You don't need to tell me anything. Just one minute, aunty... I want to tell you something. Look! Aunty, that idiot Rahul... - I'll listen to your tales later. I'll tell you something before that! You're very lucky, you know that? Rahul is very good boy! If I had a daughter, I would've made him my son-in-law. He's very mischievous but there's love behind those mischievous acts. People who understand him know it. My son and Rahul are same to me. When I went to buyjewels for my daughter-in-law, I boughtjewels for Rahul's future wife too! You wear it. Aunty, not that... - Take it! See! You'll like it. How is it? You like it? Is this sari good? You wanted to say something. What's it? That is... nothing aunty! Rahul always tells about you. We'll do this and that in Jaya aunt's house in Goa... I've very important work in Delhi. But came down here especially to meet you. This will be very good on you, would you like to wear it? Look at her!- Who? - That girl! Look there! Who is she? - That girl in maroon sari. Her face ravishing! - Forget her face, look at her waist! It's much more beautiful! How do I look? Don't stare at me... Don't smile piercingly... Don't stand before me and devour my heart... Don't take my life with your swinging waist... Won't my heart burn on seeing your scorching beauty? Like a thunder a dream has struck me... It turned me into a queen on earth... The palace turned bright with happiness... As the most beautiful dances... Everything changed in moments because of you... And my cheeks blossomed like flowers... Go on a pilgrimage to Kasi. Priest... Brother-in-law, stop... Please marry my sister... This magical thought didn't start now... May be this had started in our previous birth itself... What's this sudden expectation in my heart? I didn't have this feeling earlier, why now? Your wish must live on forever... My entire life must be with you like this day... Looks like you've got close to all of them. Yes, your people are taking good care of me. Had I introduced you as my friend, they would've offered you a plastic chair and served you a cool drink, I wanted you to be a special guest, so I lied to them. Do you think this goes to your credit? I got little importance for your lie, I got a queen's treatment for my lies! What did you tell them? You told them that we're married, I told them I'm 3 months pregnant! You're no ordinary girl! Jaya aunty gave this specially to me. - Is it? Do you know this? It seems Jaya aunt bought these bangles for your future wife. Is it? Then, give it to me. Give my bangles to me. Your bangles? Aunty gave it to you thinking you're my wife. I must give it myself to my wife. Give me. Get lost! - Will you give me or not? Give it to me! Give it to me! Aunty liked me so much and she gave it to me. If you want ask aunty to buy new bangles for your wife. Okay! Can you hear it? Let's go to beach, come. - Beach? At this hour? I'm going!

ODo you know why I told you this? Why? Because you're not that beautiful! Bloody idiot! Get up Rahul! Get up! Do you know what's the time now? Did I ever tell you how beautiful you are? I know your answer. Get up quickly. All are ready and waiting for us. Let me sleep for some more time. Our flight is scheduled to leave at 1 pm. Then, we must leave. Let's leave now. - Why so early?- Yes. Airport is near by, let's stay here for some more time and then go. We've to leave and we're going. That's it. Just some more time with uncle and aunty, please. Don't tell me anything. We're going, that's all. Jaya aunty, remember your love all my life - Priya Next time you must stay here for a month. Whether that fool comes or not. I'll show you entire Goa! Looks like you're leaving without telling me something. We both are not married. - I know it. - You know it? How can you marry without me? I knew you were lying. But liked your lie and that girl too! That girl is very good! Neither I nor your mom can find a better girl than her for you. Give it. Present these bangles and express your love to her. Why are you dull? I'm asking you! For leaving early? Don't open your eyes or talk till I ask you! Be silent! - Why? Where are you taking me? What did you tell me? You said you missed visiting Goa three times, and missing it for the fourth time also, we've four hours before our flight leaves, you'll not miss this time. There's something deep inside the heart... Gestures don't make any sense... There's something hidden in the words.. Do something in action... From yesterday to today... it has changed totally... Imaginations of the past have become wishes to reach you... I'm seeing you everywhere... I'm hearing you always... I'm seeing a life every moment... At last I'm the smile on your face... Why should there be a change like this? What's the reason behind all this? Though we know the answer, we ask the question... Come out from the depths of the heart... The thought reaching the eyes... The desire in the eyes fall on the smile of lips... It hides in the laughter... The thought stopped there... It crosses, what would happen to me? What would I become? Just one word only, what are you waiting for? I'm allergic to take off. Had you not come to the marriage, I would've got bored! Have you forgotten anything? Your clothes! You've forgotten it. Where would I get my luggage? There! 1 Mother! How is Jaya aunty? How did the marriage go off? Fine, mom. How was the bride? - Fine. How did you write your exams? - Fine, mom. Sister! When did you come? Last night. - How are you? Are you fine? I'm fine. I'm here from America for you and what are you looking there? Nothing sister. Sister! Brother! Rahul, food is getting cold, get your sister too. Sister! Sister! - What? Come quickly, sister. Let's have lunch. Wait a minute. - Okay. You're practicing time is getting reduced with every passing day, Shiva. Prakash is practicing 14 hours everyday. If you don't increase the practicing time, he'll surely win. Practice? Let's see in the final. To win he must participate, right? Find Prakash's house. I got it. Who is he? She's talking to him. You're after her from the day she joined this college. You've told her I love you hundred times, and she has said no two hundred times. You forget her, let's first take Prakash to task. We can take care of Prakash later, first her! What are you talking to her? She had a doubt and I was explaining her. Doubt? Tell me now... Go away! How many times I've told you? Can't you understand? Whether you like it or not, you're mine! Whether you cry or laugh, it's for me only. Whether you like it or not, you'll marry me only! On the auspicious Thursday of Telugu month Chaitra, Goutham and Divya's marriage will be solemnized. This is notjust a ring! Our family's fortune! I'm handing it over to you, take care of it well. Where did you buy this ring? It's very beautiful! She didn't even tell us about it. He gets enraged for talking to her, can't imagine what he would do if she marries? That's why, kept it secret. What's it Shiva? This is what you've understood in all these years! You said I'll create trouble in your engagement, you're wrong. If I knew this before I wouldn't create trouble, I would've killed! Till now I said I don't like you! Just now you said you don't love me. No man who loves a girl would hurt her in any way. He wouldn't torture her. He wouldn't threaten to kill her. Yours is love but a craze! I'll not leave you, I'm telling you again. You're mine. Give that ring to me. Leave me! No Shiva! I searched everywhere but didn't find it, madam. You've been searching from morning, night has fallen. Go home now. No, I can't go home without that ring. My mother-in-law told me to take good care of it before giving me. I've understood it, madam. I'll search the entire night and find the ring. Shiva and his friends booze here, they may come her any time now. It's not good for you to stay here. Go home. Sister... sister... what happened sister? Why are you crying? Tell me sister. What happened? Where is Shiva? - There! Where is the ring? Threw it here, right? Find it! Find, it bastard! Find it! Will you kill my sister? Bloody! If you don't find the ring, I'll kill you. Find it! Find it! How dare you beat my sister! Find the ring! Find it... find it... Find the ring! Find the ring, bastard! Is it? Priya too loves you? Yes sister. Shiva will not agree. I don't know who Priya was when I fell in love with her. I can't change my heartjust because she's his sister. Get up! A brother like you! She's also a girl like me. As much as I love you, Priya too love her brother. May be more also. I would be sad if anyone separates me from you, likewise Priya too would be sad if anyone separates her brother. I'll be with Prabhu, you do the shopping. As usual clean the stores. Why are you so late? I hate party as much as I hate shopping. What would you like to have? What else? - You tell me. What's your dad saying? - He's still angry on me. Look who is here? Cool! You would've forgotten it and he too! No need to get involved in each other's lives. He's coming towards us! May be on some otherjob. - No, he's coming towards us. I heard you got married. What else? How's your business? Have you come to shop? - No, I came to meet you. You've a sister Priya, right? I love her. Don't get angry! She loves someone else. But I'll not chase and torture her like you. I love her sincerely. I hope some day Priya will understand my love. I came here to tell you this. Tell Priya I had inquired about her. Finished shopping so quickly! Didn't you bring anything for me? Do you love anyone, Priya? Yes, that is... Do you love anyone? What has happened to you? Not today, I've been watching since the day you came here. You're no more yourself. I'm your elder brother. I've never denied anything you had asked. Now also! Please tell me. Yes brother! Who is he? I told you about meeting a man in Goa, right? That idiot! Yes. Did you meet him? No need to see him, dear. The way he spoke to me on phone, I could judge his manners, his good family background. More over you like him. How does he look? I'm very happy. I'll tell our parents immediately about this on phone. Brother! I like him but I don't know if he likes me or not. Would he not like you? If he doesn't like you, I'll make him like you. Okay? You don't worry. If necessary, I'll fall at his feet. I've his phone number, we're good phone friends. I'll call him now. Why are you rushing? Not rushing dear, just being careful. If that rogue manages to trap you, I may not be able to bear it. Who is that rogue? That's my personal problem. You be happy, dear. Okay? I'll take care of everything. Why hasn't he yet called me? No sister, I should've got the call by now. Sister, see who is calling? What great confidence you have! Hey Shiva! You bloody! Where the hell were you man? Bloody idiot! It seems you got married! Why didn't you invite me to your marriage? You've become every proud for making money in business. That's alright, how is your sister Shanthi? Why don't you talk to me, Shiva? Silly boy! I'm Priya's brother Shiva! Priya's brother Shiva means Goa... that girl... You're not that Shiva, right? I'm that Shiva only! Shiva, I'm really very sorry. Shiva was my classmate, useless guy! I'm not that Shiva! Tell me Shiva, how is Priya? - Priya is fine. She told me everything about you. That's why I called you. Can I talk to you for 5 minutes? - No way! Not possible on phone, let's meet personally. Let's meet personally and discuss. I too felt the same. Can you meet me tomorrow morning at 11.30 am in office? Sure! What's this?

You look shocked! Shall I tell you frankly? - Tell me. First impression on seeing you is you're a useless guy! I didn't expect you're such a big shot! Your Priya is very lucky. Who is this Priya between us? Don't you know the girl you love? Priya, my young sister. Is Priya your sister? I always call her as Pandu.. Very nice name sir. Not yours, brother-in-law, your phone is ringing. Don't keep it there, it's affect kidney, keep it here. Brother-in-law is very careful. What? Has Shankar cheated us? Go with few men and break his limbs. Do you've to tell me this also? Who was it? Sorry brother-in-law. I can tolerate anything but not cheating. Hope he doesn't find me. Brother-in-law isn't suspecting us, right? He knows you'd break limbs if anyone cheats you. Brother-in-law! - Have you come? I'm calling you here and why are you looking back? He's playing fun because you're his brother-in-law. Playing fun, right? What was your feeling when you met Priya for the first time? It's difficult to say. How can he if you say Priya? Say Pandu! Priya means your Pandu. - My Pandu. - My sister. What was your feeling when you first met her? What did Priya tell you? - Nothing. I'll also not tell you anything. Priya must tell first anything that's between us. I mean brother-in-law's idea is... I'm getting nervous when you whisper into his ears. Say it openly what ever you want to. I'll not be confused. He's playing fun again. Brother-in-law, I don't know how time is flying away while talking to you. When you come to know, you'll come after my life. I'll take leave. Why are you insisting on leaving, brother-in-law? Please sit here, let's talk for some time. May be he's having some program with Priya, I mean Pandu. Finally one word, brother-in-law. - Tell me. My father will discuss about marriage. I'll discuss about the financial aspect. Tell me what do you want as dowry. - I want my life. What? Pandu is my life. Give your Pandu as dowry to me. My heart is filled with happiness on hearing your words, brother-in-law. If you know the truth, your heart will stop. I'll take leave now. I like you very much, brother-in-law. Will you ask me to marry you also? Playing fun again. - Let me leave with this happiness. Playing fun! Who are you? Why did you come here? Nobody is in home. Did I ask you to take me to Goa? Did I ask you to introduce me to Jaya aunty as your wife? Did I ask you to get me dressed up beautifully in marriage? Did I ask you to save my life that night? Did I ask you to take me around Goa? You did everything without me asking for it, why did you leave without telling me what I was eagerly waiting? Priya! O my dear, my heart is drowned in your love... Do you know you're an island of love in my lonely imaginary world? Even wind touching you would say I love you... In the smile of my sulking lover, I see my love... did my life seek help from you? Did youth play hide and seek with you? If you think thrill is other name of love... My lips will hide you... I'll not leave you alone, I'll not let anything hurt you... I'm the life of your dream... What do you say? I'm vast like the sky... Can't you fall on me like shining stars? I'm flying in your mischief... Can't you overwhelm me with your love? I'll love you much more than you think... I'm there for you always, my love... What would become of me caught in your magic? Hi brother! - How did you write exam? Very well. Sorry, I can't pick you up. I'm going to airport to pick up mom and dad. I can judge how happy you're in your words. I've asked Rahul to pick you up, has he come? He's here. Can you please give the phone to him. Brother wants to talk to you. No formalities between us, Shiva. You're increasing petrol prices every day, it's very difficult, it's burning our pockets as well as our hearts. What? Don't keep phone there. - Why sir? It's affect you. - How do you know sir? I didn't want to disturb your exam so didn't tell you about our problem. What's the problem? Your brother! What shall we do now? Let's break up! It's difficult for us to unite, your brother will not agree. That's why I sent my friend to your brother. He's very good man, he'll take good care ofyou. Your brother too liked him very much. You'll also start liking him. You, your brother and he, all three of you can be happy. Please forget me, Priya. Why are you crying? Where would I go leaving you? For this hug, I played this drama. Hold me... hold me! If not I'll go. Brother! Come fast! You carry on... Why are you shouting? Rahul, this is the first chase in my life. First chase? I never expected there would be a chase in my life too. This is the first and last chase in our lives. Got it? Then, this chase must be most thrilling! Shall we do one thing? Shall we fly the car in air? Shall we do another thing? There's a pond, let's plunge car into it for variety. No Rahul, I don't know to swim. Flying in air is better. You... OCome... come... Ifwe get caught now, we're finished. He's catching up! Priya stop! You'll die man! Are you playing with me? What's this? This is a chase Rahul! Isn't it good? I'll change it. This is good. What's this Rahul? Shall I stop playing the song? Notjust the song, you too stop talking. Sit silently. Enjoying this dangerous chase! If you get caught, you'll be in trouble. 3Bloody, you're finished today! Stop... stop I'll take you to task! Brother's jeep has slowed down. It has stopped! Stopped? May be run out of petrol. Our car too is slowing down. We're also running out of petrol. Slowing down... stopping... - Will it stop? What happened? I think we too have run out of petrol. Not think, it's over! Brother has got down. Till now I thought he wouldn't catch up but I'm scared now. Whatever may happen between us, don't get down from the car. Rahul fast! I didn't expect to get caught so quickly. I thought I would get some time if I send another man in my place. I've to make a new plan now. No need. By now my mom and dad would've reached home. - So what? My brother fears only one in this world, that's my father. He shivers if my dad looks at him angrily. Father is not talking to brother for 3 years. He has come now forgiving him. Ifwe meet my father and tell him everything. No! - Why? Ifwe tell him, your father may not forgive Shiva. It's not correct to split them for our union. What shall we do now? You don't do anything, you trust me, right? Then, do what ever your father and brother ask you to do. Leave the rest to me. Don't get down from car. Brother! Brother please no! Brother please... Sit inside! Sir, your father and mother are here. This was when we went to Singapore. Did he take you to Singapore too? Look, he has changed. - I don't believe it. Because of Rahul's sister, dad stopped talking to me for 3 years. 3 years! If he comes to know about this matter, dad will never see me again in this life. If you or Rahul disturb their happiness in these days, I'll kill him immediately. I'll not tell daddy anything, I'll do as you say. You don't need to kill Rahul. Rahul told me to do as you say. That's why! What's that? - Shiva is coming. How are you dad? - I'm fine. Are you happy now? I don't have any regrets now, mom. Do you know him, Shiva? Father, he's... I don't know him. He's alive, let's take him to hospital immediately. We don't who he is, stay out of it. A man is dying and you say stay away from him. He may die ifwe don't take him to hospital. Call ambulance. 1 It'll take time for ambulance to come here, father. There's a hospital near by. What are you watching? Carry him. - Okay father. Be careful, carry him. Come. Who are you? What's your name? Who beat you? A man beat and left me on road. I didn't know where I was and where to go, I entered the nearest house, I swear I didn't know it was your house! Uncle, he is... - My son Shiva! He carried you to hospital. Did you carry me? Who is she, uncle? - My daughter Priya. She nursed you like her own meeting doctors and buying your medicines. For my sake! Who beat you? Tell me his name. I'll see his end. I'll break his limbs and lock him up. Shiva, you're sweating, increase the speed of fan. Tell me who he is, what's the trouble? Like your Priya, my sister too is very beautiful, while she was in college, a rogue was torturing her, tell me Shiva, what would you do if anyone teases your sister? Please tell me. That is... - My son would've bashed him. I too did the same, uncle. I bashed him black and blue. Then? Flashback is quite long, for some energy... Brother, juice please. What are you looking at? Give him the juice. Poor boy can't hold it, help him to drink. Okay father. Please co-operate. Did you make the juice, Priya? - Yes. Juice is also very sweet like you. You beat him and what next? Then, I fell in love with a girl, uncle. You know about the problems lovers face now, uncle. I got it, her parents don't like it and sent men to attack you. Am I right? Not her parents, it's her brother who doesn't like me. What's his problem? I told you about beating up a man, right?- Yes. That's him! He's that man! He's seeking revenge by becoming a hurdle in our love. Bloody idiot! You beat him 3 years ago, why can't you bash him again? How can I beat him? He's our family member, right? Family member? How? Uncle, if I marry his sister, he'll become my brother-in-law, right? It's not good to beat brother-in-law. We've to live together, right? Ain't I right, Shiva? You're right, I like you. You've to learn a lot from him. What are you saying uncle? I've so much to learn from them. They both are Gods who saved my life, uncle. He's bring back to life the old Shiva in me. No! I've changed. Please let me be like this, it's good. Are you denying me my wish, brother? No, I'll accept anyone in this world, but not him! He told you to do what ever I say, right? Go back to Delhi with mom and dad. Go back. I'll go brother. Not because Rahul told me but you told me to go. I love you as much as I love Rahul. We'll confirm the tickets, you stay here. Don't go away, stay put here. - Okay. Why? You're sending Priya too along with your parents to Delhi, for that! So what? Turn back and see! I'm also going to Delhi in the same flight. Here's the ticket! You're an hurdle for everything but in Delhi nobody can stop me. Once your father leaves to office, I'll romance with your sister. Hey you... Tickets are confirmed, we'll leave now. Cancel it dad. She said she has some work there. Geetha called me just now. - Why? That is... that is... Geetha is pregnant, dad! Why are you hesitating to share happy news? We've been waiting to hear this news. I'm very happy. Why are you rushing? Aren't you eager to meet daughter-in-law? He too is eager to meet his wife. Isn't it? Where are you all going? We were going back to Delhi but cancelled it. Is it? Why? - My Shiva is going to become a father. That's really happy news! I wish you've a son just like you. Enough... enough... Father, we're getting late, he's getting late to flight. Shall we go? - Flight? For me? No! I came here to send off a friend. What's that? - Ticket? I picked it up from ground to write a number. Father, wait here, I get the vehicle. What happened, Shiva? Any problem? - What happened? Your mother and sister are waiting there. No problem, just starting trouble, it'll start I've a car, let's go in it. - No need! I think petrol pipe got blocked again, dad. Okay see it. Please listen to me, leave it. I know everything, please be quiet. Do it fast, they're waiting. Please listen to me. What happened? I told you, is it necessary? Uncle, please tell him. You wait, you do it fast. Why are you asking him to do it, uncle? Please it's not good! Sip it fast! I think petrol is contaminated. It's smelly! - It'll be smelly, I know it. They're mixing petrol with something. You don't listen to me, Shiva. Come uncle, let's go in my car. It's new car and AC too. Come Shiva. How is your girl friend? Very good, uncle. Girl friend? I didn't tell you, right? He loves a girl. - Is it? He fell into our home after he got beaten up by her brother. Really? - Yes, he beat me black and blue. Oh no! Please bring her once to home. I want to meet her. I'll definitely bring her to you. How will she be? - She's like a golden doll! She has no resemblance with her brother. He's a worst fellow, a rogue to the core. Abuse him, he must be... - Mother, no need of it. What else then? Will he beat him for loving his sister? How could he dare beat after meeting him?- Right? Let me get him, let him lose the hands that beat you. Mother, please stop it now. - Aunt, he kicked too! May he lose his legs too! - Mother, please stop it. No use in scolding him. - You're right dad. We must scold his parents, they didn't raise him well. We must tonsure their heads and take them on a donkey. Do her parents like you? I'm doing all this to win their favour, aunty. Move Priya. You thank Rahul and come. Have parents-in-law left? Was the flight on time? They're outside. - What? Why? - I lied to my parents. I told them you're pregnant. I know you're hurt but please don't tell anyone it's a lie. Do you know what you're saying? You know we've been waiting years for a child. Have you turned into a joke and drama? How can I lie to them? Sister-in-law! I'm extremely happy dear. What great news you've given us! I was never so happy in life, dear. Geetha, you'll take rest fully. They'll take care of everything. Are you fine, Divya? Why are you shocked? Didn't recognise me? I know you've not forgotten me. But I've forgotten you. Your brother has come back to scratch the old wounds. I loved you then, your brother loves my sister now, account is settled, your brother beat me and warned me to leave you alone, I left you, now I beat your brother and warned him to leave my sister, but he hasn't left her, accounts are not tallying, if your brother chases my sister in the name of love, to settle the account, I may have to start chasing you in the name of love. You know how my love would be! Put some sense into your brother. Whether we should meet again or not depends on your brother's decision. You're not hurt, right? Did he do like that? Did he threaten your sister? We mustn't spare him alive. Father, what had really happened was... I can't believe what Rahul said, tell him what did he do? Shiva, I'm giving up my love for her. Today her brother threatened my sister. He threatened to stop loving his sister. My family is more important to me than my love. Will you meekly surrender for his threat? Are we not with you? You're marrying that girl, okay? That's not right, dad! - Why? No father, from what Rahul says, I think he'll go to any length. He threatened his sister now, tomorrow he may beat his mother, may be kill Rahul too, I think it's better to give up love than to hook up with such rogues? Are you asking Rahul to kill his love fearing his threats? Rahul is very good boy, dad. He says family is over above love! How can such a good boy be happy in a rogue's family? Rahul will find a better girl than her. It necessary, let's find a girl for him ourselves. Any how... I remember my father on seeing you, uncle, I felt sharing with you would reduce my burden. Sorry if I had disturbed you. You were great! How dare he plays me using my dad! Look, how I hit back using his sister! I hit his weakest point. Give me one more large. - For me too! Father, just for relaxation... Make me also a double large. You've a double large only when you're happy, father. What's the reason, dad? - You!- Me? I had a doubt whether you've changed or not, from today I've no doubt. What did he do to clear it, uncle? The way he convinced Rahul... Very good! I like you son! - It's not my greatness, dad. I told him the fact, dad. I've seen many people like her brother. I told him to be careful, that's all. I'm not talking about the advice you gave to Rahul. The hint you gave me, right? I'm talking about that. What hint did I give you, dad? Just recollect what you said about Rahul! I said Rahul is good boy and he would get a good girl. Then? If necessary, let's find a girl for him ourselves. I got it why you said like that. - What did you understand from it, uncle? Didn't get it yet? He said that our Priya. I like Rahul very much. When you said today morning how much I got an idea then Rahul would be perfect match for Priya. Now that his love has also failed. We can meet his parents with this marriage proposal. What do you say? - Father... not that... Priya, come here! - Coming. Come dear. Sit here dear. What's it dad? There were two reasons to come to Hyderabad. One to meet your brother and second to find a groom for you. I like Rahul very much. What's your opinion? That is you... marriage... You wanted to marry after PG, right? If brother says so, that's my idea too. It seems she'll marry after 2 years, dad. May be it was then. Now your brother is asking you, accept! Ask him to say it, dad. - Not a big deal. He gave me this idea. Tell her to marry Rahul. father, I think brother doesn't like Rahul. Nothing like that. He loves Rahul very much, right? Very much! - Then, tell her. Tell her to marry Rahul. - I'll tell her, father. Priya, you marry Rahul! Okay dad. O my dear, I'm nothing without you... I'm mad in your love... Sensational! Your dark kohl laced eyes are sensational... My heart is eagerly waiting for you, my dear... For you my dear... My heart says I love you... Come what so ever I'll wait for you, my love... For you my love... My words and my silence is for you only... Cuckoo will not keep quiet and is singing new songs... Let this flight in the world of bliss carry on till our marriage... Where ever I may go, I'll reach you only... May I entangled with you forever... My love is fragrant flower spreading fragrance around me... Love is like that... everything is wonderful... Mornings are for you... Moonbeam is for you... Sweet nothings are for you... My life is for you... Its not easy to write a simile that's not written in love stories... Words have gone silent and silence is magical, feelings are plenty... Your smile is saying it loudly, my dear... Enough of confusion, be mine... Even if our love is written is air, it won't wither.. Though drowned in waves, it'll reach the shore... My love is for you... - For you... Leave it! What ever you do, he turns into his favour. Leave it for Priya. He's alive still because Priya loves him. I threatened his sister but he didn't give her up. I bashed him but he didn't give her up. There's only one option left now. To kill him! What are you saying? Yes. I'll kill Rahul! What will you achieve if you go to jail after killing him? Its important that he dies, no rule that you must kill him, right? How? Is it you? - Come in. Brother... brother... Prabhu has sent him, brother. Sit down, Shiva. He's handsome. Kill him? How much? - Rs. 10 lakhs. Take full payment. Count it. - Okay brother. You don't misunderstand me. - Details are behind the photo. Brother... brother... Be careful! How did fall down? - I don't know brother. What the hell were you doing? There are so many here, can't you take care of my brother? What? Got him? Did you get him? How many more days? How long will you search for him? How long have you been searching for him? Comb the entire area, find his place, get his details, I must get every information about him... If you don't come with him, I'll kill you all. Brother... What happened to him? Call ambulance. Call! Call! What happened? Look at me! Brother! Do you know him? Is it he? Is it he who beat you? Yourjob will be done, you can go. Go! Isn't the payment enough? Ask me more. I'm going to kill him for my sake not for you. Go away! If you want ask more money, don't say you'll do it for free. Are you doubting my intention? Won't you believe me? Come... come... Look at him! Look at the plight of my brother. He went to Goa and came back like this. He went after some girl in the beach, won't youth be mischief? He beat my brother mercilessly. I'm madly searching for him. I found him because of you. When did it happen? - About a week. Yourjob will be done, you go! I got him at last! Bring him to me in 30 minutes! Go! What happened in Goa? That is... - What happened in Goa beach? Tell me the truth. Brother! How dare you touch my sister? Where are you? Brother! Kill him boys! Brother! Brother... - What happened to Shiva? Please listen to this! How dare you beat us! I'll not spare you alive! Where did Shiva go? - I don't know. When did he leave home? - About an hour. Okay, listen carefully. Don't cut this conference call, Keep the phone on. I'll bring your brother. Okay? Hold him boys! Listen carefully, I don't have time. I want a number to be traced immediately, note the number. It's in Dhoolpet tower! - Dhoolpet tower? Hey stop! Don't kill him now! First the man who beat my brother must come here. Shiva, you wanted him dead. I'll kill him as you watch. Then I'll kill you. Keep an eye till then. Where are you coming from? - From Afzal Gunj. Can you guide me back to that place? - Okay. Go straight and turn left, further up there's a street, turn left again, there's temple of Goddess Mother, turn right there, further straight you'll see a place where they make idols, turn left there, further up you'll see a barber shop, take the street opposite to it, straight up it's Afzal Gunj! Why haven't they come yet with him? No use in trusting those fools, I'll go and get him myself. Come on boys! You both stay back here. Keep an eye on him. Where is Shiva? - Strange! I'm really lucky today! Where is Shiva? I don't get one thing. He came here with money to kill you, and you came here searching to save him, but I got one thing clearly, for that girl you both beat my brother, I'll get that girl here and rape her as you watch it, notjuts me I'll have her gang raped by all my men here. Let me what the hell can you do! Go boys! Get her! You must cross me first to reach her! It's not a gang rape if ten men rape a girl, when a single man comes and bashes up 10 men like you, that's known as gang rape! What's this? Why did you do like this? What happened was... - I know what had happened! What did Rahul tell you? He told me about you approaching Kala. Sorry father. - Why say sorry, son? You were quite adventurous, I didn't know till Rahul told me. What did he do, father? You don't know, right? The man who beat Rahul, that girl's brother, he paid a goon Kala to kill Rahul, and Shiva risked his life and saved Rahul's life. You could've told me before taking this risk, son. Where is Rahul? Brother-in-law... brother-in-law... - Me? Please come in brother-in-law, let's discuss inside. No Shiva, I'll go. Please come in. - No Shiva. Be careful! How come lace got untied now? I'll tie. Please forgive me. Please marry my sister, brother-in-law. Please Shiva, neither I want you nor your sister. I don't want this marriage. - Brother! Let him go! You go away! You go! I was playing fun. - You go! Stop Priya! Come... come, brother-in-law! We're all one family! Take it easy! Hold it properly! We'll get wet! I'll be back in a moment! - Brother-in-law! You're very funny!
