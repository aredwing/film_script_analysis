And now, ladies and gentlemen, | that international favorite, Tony De Marco. You never saw a place | like this in your life. - Hello, kids. There you are. | - Hello. I'll wait a bit on you | till the other one. - This place gives me a very uneasy feeling, A.J. | - Shame on you. - Gimme your hat and get your mind off your wife. | - That hat's all right? - Yes, your hat's all right. | - That's my hat. She knows it. | Never lost one in her life. Now, see here, A.J. | I should have been more fiirm. When I told you that I am never seen | in places like this, I meant it. I don't know how you've managed to get me | this far. I should have put my foot down. - Don't be a square from Delaware. Get hep to yourself. | - What kind of talk is that? - I heard it on a jukebox. | - Well, I don't think I like it. - I have your table, Mr. Mason. | - Thank you, Harvey. Come on, Pottsie. Hey, Phil, do those two | come here very often? Well, I haven't seen | the mortician before... but that old mountain goat | in the blue serge... comes leaping in here | two or three times a week. That old mountain goat | happens to be my father. Well, you see, I like goats. | Lovely animals. Some of my best friends are- | How about another goat- uh, beer? No, thanks. | I think I'll horn in on the old goat. The usual. Lemonades. - What did you order? | - Lemonade. How do you like Tony De Marco? | Great, isn't he? I hope that woman's his wife, because | if she's not, there should be a law. That's a good one. Good, eh? A.J., look. | We have company. - What are you doing here? | - I was about to ask you the same thing. Well, we just dropped in | for a nightcap. - We missed the Westchester train, and | Potter here suggested- - Nothing of the kind. - Andy, this is entirely your father's idea. | - What? - Yes. | - Young man, I thought you had to get back to your outfiit. Well, I do, but I didn't say when. | I've got till Monday morning. How 'bout you? | Mrs. Potter give you a furlough too? I promised my wife I'd be home before | midnight. I like to keep my promises. She expects me to, | and I expect her to expect it. Say, Peyton, supposing I get | Mrs. Potter on the phone... - and explain that you and Dad just dropped in- | - Go ahead, son. - She likes Andy, and anything he tells her will be okay. | - I'll call her, fiix everything. - You be sure to explain to her | that this is just lemonade. - Lemonade. | - Lemonade. And now, folks, | the Club New Yorker proudly presents... its beautiful dance instructors, | specially imported to teach you... that brand-new South American | dance sensation, the Uncle Samba. Our girls don't wait for leap year. | They choose their partners now. And you don't have to | wait either, gentlemen. Look around and choose | your nearest exquisite. All right, girls. | Grab your partners and let's go. Come on up. That's the idea. There we go. There you are. Hello? Hello! Oh, hello, Andy. | Where are you? Club New Yorker? | Oh. Potter's with you? Dad brought him here after the dinner | for a nightcap. Don't worry about him. Don't give him anything stronger | than lemonade. The last time he had champagne was | on our honeymoon. It was at Niagara. He thought he was a barrel. He wanted me | to roll over the falls with him. I'll look after him. Is Vivian there? | Put her on. Hold on. I'll call her. | Oh, Vivian! - Yes, Blossom. | - Phone, dear. - Who is it? | - Andy. Oh. Hello, Andy. At the Club New Yorker? He is? How dare you drag my father | to such a sinful place? Tell your mother she has | nothing to worry about. My father, he's doing all right. Say, that girl's a honey. | Who is she, Ruth? - That's Eadie Allen, one of our new girls. | - Eadie Allen. Hmm. Mr. Potter! This is all your fault, A.J. It was you who sicced | that gypsy on me. - She's no gypsy. She's a Brazilian. | - Well, whatever she is, she's a- - She's a bombshell. | - Bombshell. That's exactly right. Did you see that man with the camera? | Did you see that thing explode in his hands? I was lucky to get out alive. | Now I'm gonna be fiirm. We are leaving. Well, I talked to Mrs. Potter | and everything's fiine. - She was delighted to hear that you had taken up dancing again. | - She was? Did you tell her about me out there | dancing with that South American savage? I knew I shouldn't have | let you telephone. I was only joking. | I told her nothing. What I was doing out there, | that wasn't Peyton Potter at all. - Now, don't be modest. You were swell. | - Really. I've had enough. - Mason, if you please. | - Old Pottsie can't take it. Well, you go along with him. | I've got some unfiinished business. Unfiinished business? | That must mean a girl. Boy, I wish I were young again. - Well, I'm glad you're not. Where would I be? | - Good night, Son. Good night, Dad. Oh, waiter. | Take a message to Phil Baker. - Ask him to meet me at the bar between shows. | - Yes, sir. And, waiter. Have him | bring Miss Allen with him. - There you are. | - Yes, sir. Miss Allen. - You want to see me, Andy? | - Yes, but, well, where's Miss Allen? Miss Allen? Oh, you see, between shows, | she goes over to the Broadway Canteen. This is her night | to dance with servicemen. - Didn't you tell her I wanted to meet her? | - She wasn't interested. - I'm afraid you picked the wrong girl. | - Yeah? I think I'll go over | to that Broadway Canteen. - I'm warning you, you won't get to fiirst base. | - I'm pretty good at baseball. So was the mighty Casey, | but even Casey struck out. It'll take more than three strikes | to keep me away from fiirst base. - Fifty bucks says you go down swinging. | - I'll take that bet. - Have you ever been in Tennessee? | - No. Is that where y'all from? - You guessed it. And I bet I can tell you where you're from. | - Where? Heaven, lady. | Heaven. Shove off, sailor. - So long, angel. | - So long, Tennessee. - Are you really an angel? | - The navy seems to think so. My mom always told me, if I was | a good boy, I'd see an angel someday. You be a good boy now and watch | that right hand. It's slipping. Just lookin' for your wings, baby. | Lookin' for your wings. - Do I really have to give you up? | - Sorry, it's the rule here. The marines lay the groundwork, | and the army takes over. When I fiirst saw you, | I said, "target for tonight. " Hmm. You're not | wearing them, are you? - Not wearing what? | - Your marksmanship medals. Ah, I wish you weren't | so beautiful. Why? Well, then nobody would cut in, and you'd be | all mine for the rest of the evening. Have you been getting results | with that line? Aw, I'm sorry. You're used to getting a pretty good spiel | from most of these fellas I guess. Oh, I don't mind them. After all, | they're a long way from home. A long way from their girls. You can't blame them if they get | off the beam once in a while. They're all pretty sweet. Even the wise ones. Say, would you think | I was too forward if I, uh- If you what? Well, if I asked you your name? No, of course not. It's Allen. | What's yours? - What? | - I said, "What's your name? " Oh. Well, uh, it's, uh, Casey. Casey? Hmm. | That's a pretty good name. - "Casey at the bat. " | - That's me. - Huh? | - Well, I- I mean, | I played a lot of baseball. - Are you pretty good? | - Well, that depends. Sometimes I, uh, | don't even get to fiirst base. - I like baseball. | - So do I. I like dancing too. - Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. | - That's all right. Would you like something to eat? - Why, yes. I guess I would. | - Doughnuts and coffee? - If you led me to it, I'd eat hay. | - Well, come on. May I have a couple, June? Thank you. | There you are. - Oh, cream and sugar? | - No, thanks. You'll fiind those awfully good. | You can dunk if you'd like to. - Dunk? | - Mm-hmm. Like this. - Isn't that better? | - Yes, much better. Here. Have another bite. Couldn't we just talk? | I'm not awfully hungry. Well, I have to leave pretty soon now. | I've got a show to do. A show? | Are you an actress? Well, not exactly. | Just a showgirl from the Club New Yorker. - A showgirl. | - Mm-hmm. - Gee, no wonder you're so glamorous. | - Now. - Say, if I'm not being too forward- | - Yes? You suppose I could walk | to the club with you? Or do you have a boyfriend? I haven't a boyfriend. No. - But we're not allowed to leave the canteen with soldiers. | - Oh. And, uh, now I'm afraid | I'll have to say good night. Good night? Won't I ever see you again? Well, I'm here | three nights a week. Yes, but I won't have | another leave for some time. I'm sorry. | Best of luck, soldier. Thanks. - You're sweet. | - Thanks. Well, looks like | we've reached our objective. - Good night, Casey. | - I wish you didn't have to go in. - Good night, soldier. | - Couldn't I meet you after the show? We could sort of go out and you could | show me the town sort of. Will you? - I'd love to. | - Really? I'll be fiinished at 1:30.Just in time | for a drink and dance at the Stork Club. Then on to El Morocco, then just | a quick look in on Monte Carlo. After that, we'll go | to Lindy's for a late bite... and then I know | a swell spot on 52nd Street. Won't cost you more than $50... that is, of course, | if you don't tip too heavily. We're gonna have lots of fun, | Sergeant. - Those places are pretty expensive, aren't they? | - Yes, they are. Well, I'm afraid I couldn't afford it, | not on a sergeant's salary. - Well, then what do you say we skip the whole thing? | - All right. - Good night, soldier. | - Good night. - Casey. | - Yeah? Would you-Would you like | to see the show? - Gee, would I! | - I'll fiix it for you out front. Oh, don't go to all that trouble. | I'll see it from backstage. - Good night, Ben. | - Good night. - Good night, Ben. | - Oh, Miss Allen... I just had a nice talk | with your boyfriend here. Didn't know | you had a sweetheart. I, uh- I- I told him we were sweethearts. | I hope you don't mind. Stop acting like Don Ameche, | and get me a taxi. - I've got one waiting. | - Thank you. Let's go over by the rail. First a taxicab, | then the Staten Island Ferry. You certainly can pick 'em. Well, you see, I thought it was nearer | and really much cheaper than- Any nightclub in town. - You know, it is kind of nice to get out of the city at that. | - I'll say. - It's beautiful out here, isn't it? | - Mm-hmm. You're beautiful too, Eadie. I couldn't keep | my eyes off you in that show tonight. You ought to be the star | instead of just one of the girls. I won't be for long. Phil promised me | a song in the new show. Really? | I didn't know you could sing. - Phil thinks I can. | - He's a swell guy. You'll like him | when you get to know him. That sounds as though you're going | to let me come around some more. - Could be. | - Well, after all... I suppose I'll have to hear | you sing sometime, won't I? Yes, I suppose you will. Well, what are we waiting for? All right, soldier, you win. Ready? Hear the orchestra? Yeah. Where's it coming from? Where's your imagination? Gee, that's swell. - Did you really like it? | - You bet I did. - Hey. | - What? Look over there. The evening star. Over your left shoulder too. That ought to mean something. Oh, I- I forgot to tell you. We're gonna have Benny Goodman | and his orchestra in the new show. - Oh, you are? | - Mm-hmm. That's fiine. I'm certainly glad | I met you tonight. - Why? | - Oh, lots of reasons. Do me a favor, will you? Sing that song again. - Oh, you don't want to hear it again. | - Oh, yes, I do. - That sounds like an order. | - It is. Okay, Sergeant. - Here we are. Wait for me. | - Yes, sir. - Well? | - Oh, no. I'm gonna take you right up to the door. - Will I see you tomorrow night? | - I thought you had to go back to camp. Well, I do, but you'll be at the | Grand Central Station to see me off. I hadn't thought about it. You'll think about it now, | won't you? Uh-huh. - But you haven't even told me where you were going. | - Huh? Well, I mean your camp. | Where is it? Oh. Oh, well, uh- - Well, that's a military secret. | - Is it north, east, south or west? I- I can't tell you that either. - You see, I've never been there before. | - Oh. But from what the fellas tell me, | it's really a paradise for soldiers. - No. | - Yeah. They say it's warm | and beautiful there. And at night, even the ocean | sings you to sleep. And the moon and the stars, | why, they- - Oh, that's swell. | - Yeah. You'll be hearing from me | the minute I get there. My train leaves at 8:00. I'll meet you at | the information booth at 7:30. Well, I, uh- | I don't know whether I can make it. You see, I have a- | I have a rehearsal in- in the morning, | and I don't know for how long. Then I promised Mabel... from there I'd go to Brooklyn | with her to see the Dodgers play. I- I guess maybe I could miss | seeing the Dodgers. Won't hurt anything. - Don't be late. | - I won't. Remember. | Grand Central Station. 7:30. I'll be there. Good night. Good night. Did you have | a good time in town? Well? Vivian, I want to tell you | about last night. - You see, I- | - Andy, you don't have to explain anything to me. I simply asked you | if you had a good time. Well, uh, yes, I did. Well, that's all that matters. You're a good sport, Vivian. - But then, you've always been. | - Sure. - You're a very lucky guy to have a girl like me. | - I know that. However, don't think | I won't be properly jealous... if you go cruising around | in that uniform... and get yourself a sweetheart | in every port. Oh, I'm a soldier, | not a sailor. A soldier can get | in deep water too. Sometimes way over his head. I wish I could take this pool | of yours back to the camp with me. - You mean they don't have | a swimming pool for you... Or a nice man to bring you | tall frosty drinks when you're thirsty? Good afternoon. | How's the swimming today? Super, Mrs. Potter. | Simply super. Well, that's wonderful. | Too wonderful. - Aren't you going in, Mrs. Potter? | - Oh, mercy, no. The pool is Vivian's department. I just have the towel concession. Please. Don't rush those things | back and forth too much. These children are here | to swim in the pool. Yes, madam. Hello, kiddies. | Have you seen the morning tabloid? I suppose you'll show this to Dad | right away and be properly outraged. Oh, no. I'm saving that until I need it. Go ahead, Beezy. | Ask her. - I will. Stop pushing. | - Well, go ahead. - M-M-Mrs. Potter? | - Yes, my dear. What is it? W- Would you care to dance, | Mrs. Potter? Me? Oh, isn't that sweet of you. | Just being polite, of course. Oh, no, he isn't. | I told him you like to dance. Oh, I do. I love it. | But he is so young, and I am so- Well, you know, so-so. | Oh, you embarrass me. Really, you do. - Oh, go ahead, Mother. Beezy loves to dance. | - Yes, that's what I'm afraid of. You know, I'm not 16 anymore. | I feel silly. He wants to play. Drop that. Mrs. Potter, | I want to have a talk with you. Come to my study at once, please. Pass the ammunition, kiddies. - You going to write me? | - Are those orders, Sergeant? - I'm serious, Eadie. | - How serious? Hearing from you every day would make me | feel that you're marching... right up there with me | at the head of the column. And that's where | I want you to be, Eadie. I will write you, Andy... every day. All aboard. Leaving on Track 28. Westbound Limited. Chicago, Omaha, Denver... Salt Lake City, Los Angeles... and San Francisco. Westbound. All aboard. Well, I guess that's me. Wait a minute, Andy. - You said you were going to Florida. | - I didn't say that, darling. Yes, you did. You said you were going | to a camp where it was warm and beautiful. - But, Eadie, I- | - But I remember every word. You even said the ocean | would sing you to sleep. - And the moon and the stars and- | - Well, that's right, darling. The ocean will sing me to sleep. And the moon and the stars- The stars. Remember last night | on the ferryboat? - Yes. | - Well, look over your left shoulder again, will you? - No, Andy. No. | - Please? Just for me. Just this once. Just for good luck. Please. Andy, you've got-Andy! Andy! That's the last time | I'll ever take you anyplace. - Eadie. Well. | - Fancy seeing you here. - Yes, isn't it fancy? | - I suppose you came down to meet our train, eh? Yes, I did, | but I was a little early. Of course, you couldn't have been seeing | a few soldiers off, by any chance. A few soldiers? | Only one, I'll bet you. Sergeant Crazy. It's Casey, Dorita. And what's wrong | with saying good-bye to a soldier? - Nothing. | - I call it nice works if you can get him. - Where have you two been? | - To the cleaners. - The cleaners? | - That's what they call the racetrack. Dorita's never seen a race, | so I took her out to Empire City. I thought she ought to meet a few | of the horses she's been supporting. I've never seen a race myself, Dorita. | Tell me about it. Okay, I tell you. First you pick | the horses, to win, to place, to show. Then you buy three tickets. | You sit and hold them like this. The horse lose. | You tear up the tickets. Then you pick three more, to win, | place, show. You buy three more tickets. You hold them. | The horse lose again. You tear them up. More races, more tickets, | more horse lose. The day is over and what have you got? | I'll show you. Hold this for me. | Like this, yes. Horses. Well, it looks like | a white Christmas. A.J., have you seen | the San Francisco newspaper? Why should I see | the San Francisco newspaper? Well, my secretary's hometown | is San Francisco... and she gets the San Francisco | newspaper every day. - What's that got to do with me? | - Don't be stupid, old boy. If it weren't her hometown, | she wouldn't get the paper, would she? And I wouldn't be able to show you | this picture of your son receiving a medal. So what? What? Well, why didn't you say so | in the fiirst place? Look at that. Been in the South Pacifiic | three months and already a hero. Why wasn't I told about this? Why didn't | Andy write me? Where's my mail, Miss Custer? - Right there before you, Mr. Mason. | - Oh, so it is. - Why were you keeping this from me? | - Why, that's a medal. - It's a medal. | - Why, it's the same one as in the picture. It's the same one, on a ribbon | and everything. Isn't that handsome? - Look at that. | - Oh! He's in San Francisco. - No. | - Be home in about two weeks. - No. | - Pottsie! My son back on American soil and a hero. - Oh! | - Please. - I tell you, we've got to get busy and make some plans. | - We certainly have. Why not another stag dinner? | I had a very good time at that last one. No, no. Right here. | Behind his name, he signs "N.S.D." Yes, National Selective Draft. | You see, that's what that- National Selective nothing. | It's N.S.D. No stag dinners. No stag dinner, yes. Well, then a quiet | little party at home. Just the two families. He don't want | a quiet little dinner. He's young. | He wants excitement. Why, he wants wine, girls, song! Yes, well, there's the community | sing every Thursday night. It's really- Oh, that's so stupid, | the choir. I know what it is. His favorite spot. | The Club New Yorker. Oh. Well, that lets me out. | Of course, he's your son. If you want- Wait a minute, Pottsie. | I'm tied up with this board meeting... but you go right over to the Club New Yorker | now and make arrangements for a party. What are you talking about? I go to a place | like that in broad daylight and by myself? Oh, never mind. Now, come on. | Come on. I'll go with you. Miss Custer, | cancel my next appointment. Where did you think | you were goin'? Come on, girls. Snap into it. | Put some life into it. Close it in. Come on. Watch your feet. | Up! That's it. Lines. Now travel forward. | Come on. Forward. Travel! Oh, kind of ragged, girls. Benson, I want you | to set a new routine for this opening. - Come on, Pottsie. | - Oh, A.J. - If you're scared, hold my hand. | Mr. Baker, you remember me, Andy's father. - Yes, indeed. | - My partner, Mr. Potter. - Hello. And how's the sergeant? | - Well, if you're referring to my son... he's back from the Pacifiic | and covered with medals. Really? How do you like that? | Andy Mason a hero. And that's why we're here. | He'll be home in a couple of weeks... and I want to arrange | a party for him here. That'll be fiine. | Only, the club is closed. - We're rehearsing a new show to open in October. | - Oh, really? In that case, Mason, I'm sure Mr. Barker here | must be very busy with his chorus girls- - Now, wait a minute. | - What's the matter? - I've got an idea. | - It's too late, old boy. - This time it's a real killer diller. | - A what? Jukebox. Why don't you bring | your show up to my place? That is a ridiculous idea. | You're not well, A.J. And it's the air in here. | I know. It's this fresh paint. - Look, you can rehearse it there and present it at Oakwood. | - Oakwood? That's my place. - Of course. | - What are you talking about? That enormous terrace garden | on the south slope. We could put tables on the terrace | and stage the show in the rose garden. In my rose garden? I won't hear of such | a thing. Those are my prize yellow roses. We'll put the show on | to sell war bonds. We'll make it the biggest | bond-selling drive you ever saw. We'll charge our neighbors | $5,000 bonds for admission. Why, we'll raise a million dollars... which would go to help Andy Mason | and millions like him to get the stuff they need. Mr. Mason, if you had a beard, | you'd remind me... of my two favorite people- | Santa Claus and Uncle Sam. Well, we'll consider everything settled. You bring your whole troupe | up for a week. We got plenty of room for everybody, | two houses. Bring 'em up for two weeks. - Oh, be sensible. Actors for two weeks? You couldn't feed 'em. | - Oh, now, now. - You couldn't feed them. | - We haven't got time to be sensible. I'll call you back later this afternoon | and give you the details. - Great. | - Oh, by the way... do you think the Brazilian bombshell | will like the idea? Well, I don't know. Why don't you | ask her yourself? Here she comes now. How do you like my new costume? | You think it'll knock their feet off, huh? Sensational. Oh, Dorita, you remember | Mr. Potter and Mr. Mason. I remember Mr. Potty. You are here | to kick up some more heels, huh? - No. | - Mr. Potter wants you to come to his house this weekend. Ah-ah, you naughty boy. You are what they call a fast-work man, yes? - Mason, please. | - Well, it was really my idea. We wanted you to come | and help sell war bonds. Oh. You know, I like you both. | I think you are very cute. Phil, we're ready for Eadie Allen's number. Okay. Why don't you boys watch the rehearsal? | I want to see what you think of it. - Okay, Benny, here we go. | - All right, Phil. What do you say? | How about it, Eadie? - I'm all ready, Phil. | - All right, boys, hit the lights. Come on, girls. | Clear the stage, everyone. Hit it, Benny. Wait till you hear her sing this song. It's a lulu. Where'd you get | all these station wagons? Commandeered them from the neighbors. | I'm chairman of the transportation committee. With Mr. Mason's $5,000 war bond admission, | reservations are pouring in. And at $200 a table, looks like | a real sellout for the army and the navy. - Say, that's wonderful. | - Did you ever saw so much flowers... and trees and shrubbers? - Very nice, Dorita. Very nice. | - What are you do up in the dumps? Eadie is worried because she thinks | a certain soldier may be back from overseas. Why shouldn't I worry? | He'll never fiind me out here. The club is closed, I've left my apartment. | He won't know where I am. I know exactly | how you feel, Eadie. I have a soldier too. | He lives right next door. Andy Mason, Jr. | Maybe you know him. - Andy Mason, Jr? Why, I know him well. | - You do? Say, you're not by any chance | engaged to him, are you? Well, sort of. We've been sweethearts | since I was 10 and he was 12. - Andy's just back from Australia. | - Australia? - Casey was in Australia. | - Really? Wouldn't it be funny | if they knew each other? Yes, wouldn't it? Mr. And Mrs. Potter, I want you | to meet Benny Goodman and his boys. - How do you do, Benny Goodman and boys? | - How do you do? Go in the house. | You'll fiind everything you need. - Walter and Edward will take care of you. | - Thank you. Just make yourselves | at home, boys and girls. Mother, this is Eadie Allen and Dorita. | I think you've met Mr. Mason. - Hello. | - Welcome to Oakwood, my dears. - We're so pleased. | - Thank you. Ah, I remember you from your pictures | in the newspapers, or was it the police gazette? - How are you? | - I'm very well to do. Thank you. Ah, you do very well | what you do do. Now you young ladies will have the Magnolia | Room. That is the room next to my daughter's. I'll show you up. I'm going to like here. That hat. I'll have to watch | my bell cords and lampshades. Oh, Phil. - Hello, Mr. Mason. | - Mrs. Potter, I want you to meet Phil Baker. How do you do, Mrs. Potter? This is a great pleasure, | Mr. Baker. I've heard so much about you, | from young Andrew especially. I'm so happy to have you with us. | So happy. I'm so happy | to be here, Mrs. Potter. It's lovely of you to arrange this holiday | for my hardworking little troupe. - So very lovely. | - Oh, it's nothing at all, really. I'll leave you two to get acquainted while | I see that the boys fiind their proper rooms. - Blossom! | - Philsy! Blossom, you old cabbage, you. Oh, boy, it's more | like coleslaw now. Oh, you haven't changed a bit. I wish I could say | the same for you. - You could if you'd lie a little too. | - Do you remember Paris? - Do I? | - Ah, Paris. - Paris in the '20s. | - Oh, boy, were you a sensation with that accordion. And you with your silver soprano. | What a set of pipes. Ah, the pipes are not what they used to be. | They're a little corroded right now. Phil, if anybody in Westchester ever dreamed | that I was once on the stage and in Paris- Scandalous. Do you remember | the Count de Grace? How could I ever forget him? | He used to call me his "long-stem Blossom. " Well, what the countess called you | made international headlines. - That was the night of the Beaux Arts Ball. | - You and I took over the show. - Do you remember that Apache dance we did? | - Do I? You sure it was in the '20s? I'm positive it was in the '20s. | It was in the '20s, wasn't it? Mrs. Potter! Oh, Peytie. I was just | welcoming Mr. Baker to Oakwood. - Mr. Baker, Mr. Potter. | - How do you do, Mr. Potter? I had no idea | he was that welcome. How welcome would you say | I was in round numbers? The rest of the theatrical people | are having refreshments on the terrace. - Possibly you'd like to join them. | - You left your motor running. He's a sweetheart. I'll bet | he'd give away his last pint of blood. In fact, I think he has. I absolutely forbid you getting within | 20 feet of that man again. You understand? - Peytie, wouldn't you settle for 10? | - Well, 15 at the most. Peytie, can I help it | if I'm irresistible? It's that vitamin B1. I told you you were | taking too much. You're overdoing it. - Peytie- | - I don't care to discuss the matter at all. - All right, Cap, hook her up. | - Give me the slack. - I love that melody. | - That's the music for Tony De Marco and Maria's dance. Where are they? | Oh, Tony! Maria! Don't look now, | but here comes half of them. Don't tell me | they've been rationed too. I know, but what are you gonna do? If you don't cut that out, | the censors will. What's he saying? He wants to know why you didn't tell him | he had to dance in a rose garden. - What's that got to do with it? | - They're Mr. Potter's roses and he's fond of them. But he says you don't realize | what your fiiendish little roses have done. What have they done? No. - What'd he say? | - How should I know? They had to send his partner | back to New York with rose fever. - She doesn't like roses, so Tony hates them. | - Is that so? Where is he? There you are. | My roses aren't too fond of you. What have you got to say to that? He says he's gonna sue you | and your roses for ruining his partner's health. - Sue me? | - S! This is an outrage! Where's Mason? | He got me into this. I'm gonna have you and your theatrical troupe | thrown off this place forcibly. - Mason! Mason! | - Oh, Mr. Potter! Mr. Potter! Let him go. | Mason will cool him off. What happens to me they wouldn't believe | on the Goodwill Hour. - Eadie, tell Tony he'll have to get another dancing partner. | - Another partner? - Yes. | - But who? - That's his worry. | - Okay. I'll stay as I am. Tony! I'm sorry. | I've never seen him- - You are beautiful! | - He speaks English. It's wolf talk. | That's international. Say, Vivian's all right. | She catches on pretty quick. Well, I taught her a few steps | when her father wasn't around. I might have known. Mrs. Potter | was a great dancer herself in her day. - Really? | - She was so smooth, she could waltz around... with a glass of beer on her bustle | and never disturb the foam. - I guess Vivian takes after her. | - A block off the old chip, huh? That was thrilling, darling. I think you danced beautifully. Baby, you were great. | I want you in the show. Thank you, Mr. Baker, but I'm afraid of Dad. | He'd never approve of it. - Why not? | - You know how he feels about shows and show people. - My purple past, remember? | - Vivian's gonna be in this show. Oh, Peyton will never allow it. - Not even with some gentle persuasion? | - What do you mean? - Let's see. I've got it. Your boudoir. | - What are you talking about? I'm talking about the biggest scene | of your career. Come along, | you old tenderized ham. Well, at last, | I'm worth something. - You know what to do now? | - No, my mama never told me. Don't you worry about me. - Here he is. | - Come on, baby. Do your stuff. - Come in. Oh, Peyton. | - You sent for me, dear? - Yes, I did. | - What's Mr. Barlow doing here? - Protect me. This man is blackmailing us. | - Blackmail? - What's he want, money? | - Would it were money he wanted. - What do you mean by that? | - He threatens me unless I allow my daughter- your daughter- our daughter to dance | in the show with Tony De Marco. Why, that's unthinkable! Oh, you blackguard. | Oh, you gangster. How could you think | of such a fiiendish scheme? Now, Mr. Potter, the only decision | I want you to make is this. Shall I introduce Vivian as the charming child | of Mr. And Mrs. Peyton Potter... or shall I simply announce, | ladies and gentlemen... - I give you the talented daughter | of the notorious Blossom Murphy? You know her name? | You told him your name? - No, Peyton, he knew me in Paris. | - In Paris? You scoundrel! Out of her dark past | which she has lived down so beautifully... so gracefully, you come at a time | like this to blackmail her. Ugly word, "blackmail. " | Don't say it again. Blackmail, blackmail, | blackmail! - How much money does he want? | - I don't know. As I said before, | you cannot bribe me with gold. It is the artistry | that was Blossom Murphy... that I would restore to the world | through her daughter Vivian. Oh, Peyton, you won't make her do it! | You won't make her appear in that show! - I would die! | - I see no other way out, darling. Mr. Bailey has us in his power. - Will you give your consent, Mrs. Potter? | - If Mr. Potter insists! What else can I do? | But I'm not fiinished with you yet. I'll see a good lawyer today | to deal with you for this outrage. - My brother in Brooklyn, he's a wiz on blackmail cases. | - Oh, is he? - Yes. | - Really! - Dorita, come in. I've got a surprise for you. | - What surprise? - What was it? | - Dad's given his consent. I can appear in the show. Marvelous! | Then everything's donkey-dory, huh? - What you got there? | - Sergeant Mason. - You like him? | - Sergeant Mason? He's Sergeant Crazy! I think it's you that's crazy. Oh, no, no, I'm not crazy. | My name is Dorita. - This is the man I'm going to marry. | - What? Then he's a two-time, | double-cross snake in the bush. - Dorita. | - Yes? - Are you the woman? | - Of course I'm a woman. Do I look like a man? You don't understand. | You see... I think there was someone he was playing | around with in town. Look, nobody play around me, | in town, in cities, nowhere. I thought you recognized | this picture. At fiirst minute, yes. | But the second minute, no. It was somebody else who looked | just like him, like twin sisters. Same eyes, same hair, | same mouth. - You were telling the truth? | - Scratch my heart. Vivian, are you in? - Oh, it's Eadie! | - What about it? Does that frighten you? No, I'm cold as a cucumber. - Come in, Eadie. | - I just heard the good news. Phil's little blackmail party | really paid off. Isn't it wonderful? | I've always wanted to dance. - Tony's very excited about you. | - Oh, I'm glad. - What's the matter with you? | - Nothing. I feel in the pinks. Then stop looking like Lady Macbeth. | What's wrong with her? I don't know. | Can I get you something, Dorita? Oh, no, no, nothing. | I feel wonderful, if you don't mind. - Why don't you sit down? You seem restless. | - Oh, no, no. I like it here, just standing. - Aren't you tired? | - Yes, I guess I am. I think I go now and turn myself in | and get some shut eyes. - You know. Good night. | - Good night, Dorita. - I'll see you in a few minutes. | - Yes, good night. Dorita, you're snoring again. Dorita! Dorita, wake up! What's the matter, buglers? - Where did you get this picture? | - What picture? You know what picture. | This picture of Casey. Your birthday next week, no? - Don't change the subject. | - I'm not changing anything. Casey sent you the picture | for your birthday. Only, he send to me. And now you have spoiled surprise. | That's all. No, I haven't. It's a much better | surprise this way. - You think so, huh? Yes? | - Mm-hmm. Good. I don't get it. Good heavens, 10:00! I might expect this | from you in person... but when your picture wanders | into strange girls' rooms- Really. Well! What do you want? Mr. Mason is serving everyone mint jalops, | and I bring you a mint jalops too. - It's delicious. | - You might have saved yourself the trouble. - I am a teetotaller. I never touch alcohol. | - You don't touch. You drink it. I'm very sorry, but I am a very busy man, | and I am never disturbed at this time. So I'm going to ask you to run away, | and take those poisonous things with you. No, I stay and be a teetotaller too. | Maybe show me how to teetotal. Miss Dorita, I am a businessman. | I go in for no foolishness. - I am entirely business. | - Oh, I like that. Maybe you show me how | to be all business too. Is it fun? Well, uh, fun? Business? | Why, certainly not. It's not supposed to be fun. - Oh, no? | - No. Then I don't think I like it. | I like to have fun. - You'll never make money that way. | - Oh, money, huh? You have lots of, don't you? | Thousands and thousands of dollars, huh? I've done rather well, yes. Look, Dorita has only a little. If she had only a few thousand, | she would not work for a boss. She would work for herself | in her own nightclub. Maybe you let her have | a few thousands, maybe? Well, certainly not! | I never heard of such nonsense. I never invest | in theatrical enterprises. Never. Now, I want you to take | these two slugs I think they call them... and you tell everybody you see | that I'm not to be disturbed. - What do you invest in? | - Oh, well, several things. - I have an investment counselor, really. | - What is that? - He's a man who handles my money for me. | - I have one of those too. - Who is it? | - Phil Baker. - Phil Baker, the actor? | - Yes. - He handles your money for you? | - Only, when he handle my money, I never see it again. - Like these fiive horses with letters. | - Horses? - Yeah. | - You need say no more, Miss Dorita. I understand why you never see | your money again. You're a foolish girl. You should insist on sound investments. | Now, tell my wife- - Maybe you could handle my money for me. | - Sorry. I have no time. Oh, but how much time | would it took? How much time? It takes more time | than I could afford to give. Miss Dorita, I am in no mood | to listen to fiinancial suggestions. Oh, come on here. | Sit by me. Come on here. Sit by me and | tell me more about sound investments. - Yes, yes. You have the busiest hands. | - You think so? Sound investments? | Well, there are quite a few of them. - Quite a few I haven't got money for. Just tell me one. | - One? - Yeah. | - Well, there's National Copper. - National Copper. | - That's very safe. That's pretty. I like it very much. | Thank you very, very nice. Yes. Well, uh, then, of course, | there's American Steel. American Steel. | That's beautiful too. I like too. Thank you very, very nice. I could say Tel and Tel. Tel and Tel. | I like that best of all! - I hoped you would. Yes, I hoped you- | - Yes! And did you play money | on this Tel and Tel? Very often. | Quite a lot of money, yes. - And she come in for you? | - Yes, if that's the way you want to put it. I want to put it that way, yes. | I want to put all my money on her. - On Tel and Tel? | - Yes! Thank you very, very much! Buddy, what's the matter? I don't know. - But it's happened. | - What happened? - Does that mean anything to you? | - No. - Well, it does to me. | - I don't understand. Oh, nobody is more surprised | than I am. Mr. Potty, I'm afraid of you. You are, really? National Copper, eh? American Steel? Well- - Don't move! | - Mrs. Potty. Don't mention my wife. | We're going to keep this all on an even keel. Mrs. Potty- - Do you remember the other night | when we danced together? You do remember. Good. | You remember how I held you in my arms? That's the way I'm gonna hold you now. - No, no, no. Mrs. Potty! | - We'd like to be alone, please. Darling, how marvelous! We were just | discussing the invasion- the investments. It's Tel and Tel, Miss Dorita. | You mustn't forget it. That's one of | our soundest investments. You can't go wrong with Tel and Tel. | Can we, darling? Tel and Tel! | Oh, Tel and Tel! - Thank you very, very nice. | - Just a minute. It wasn't my fault. | He swooped me off my feet. Oh, chop, chop, chop. So- Well, old swoopy, swapping swoops at your age. | What have you got to say about that? I told you, darling, | we were simply discussing investments. I see. Is that the way | it's being done nowadays? No wonder you come home | from the offiice so tired. That's what I say, dear. | That's what I say. No wonder. Oh. Ketchup. No doubt. | And from a Brazilian tomato. Darn it. | Hook me up, will you, soldier? - Thanks. | - Excuse me. - Hey, where are you going? | - Andy. Andy, welcome home, Son. - Dad. | - I knew you'd do it. Certainly looks good to see you again | after all these months. - That goes double, Dad. | - Why didn't you wire me? I didn't expect you till evening. I flew in. | Gee, it's great to be home. But, Dad, what's going on around here? | The house is full of show people. Don't worry, Son. I locked up all the silverware | and put all the breakable stuff away. I've got a big surprise for you. - Oh, Vivian. | - Come in, Eadie. - Does that do it, Nanette? | - I think it will. - Good morning. | - Good morning. - My, but you look pretty. | - I hope so. Andy's coming home today. That's right. I'm looking forward | to meeting your Andy. - You'll like him. | - I'm sure I will. - There, that does it. | - Thank you, Nanette. - You're welcome, Miss Vivian. | - Well, what a coincidence. - What? | - This frame. I have one exactly like- What are you doing with this picture | on your dressing table? - That's the man I'm going to marry. | - Are you kidding? No, of course I'm not kidding. | It's a very good picture of him. - I agree with you. | - You do? You don't even know him. - Not really, but I've seen him. | - You have? Mm-hmm. Look. | Tsk, tsk, tsk. What would your sergeant | think of this? I'll bet Dorita had something | to do with it. You wait and see. Tell me, Dad, | what's the idea? It's a little surprise party | for you, Sergeant. Being as you're opposed | to bachelor dinners... we're staging a big show next door in | Potter's gardens, and you're the guest of honor. No fooling? You're really doing all that | for me? Gee, that's swell, Dad. Brought up the whole | Club New Yorker. Brought up the whole show. | Well, what do ya know? Say, wait a minute. | Did you say the Club New Yorker? - Sure. | - But that means Phil Baker and Dorita and Eadie- - Eadie's here, isn't she? | - You mean Miss Allen? - Yeah. | - Sure. She's one of their stars. You know her? Know her? I'm in love with her. | I'm going to marry her, Dad. - Now wait a minute, Son. Hold on. | - It's true. I came up to tell you- | to tell everybody. See here, the excitement's upset you. | You don't realize what you're saying. - You're gonna marry Vivian Potter, remember? | - Yes, yes, I remember. - But that can wait. | - Yeah. - Wait? | - Well, it's like this. You see- I can't explain now, Dad. I've got to see | Eadie right away. Where is she? - Why, she's next door with Vivian. | - With Vivian? You mean to say that she's over there | with Vivian right in the same house? Sure. See here, Son. Was this Eadie Allen the unfiinished business | you had to attend to... that night at the Club New Yorker | just before you sailed? Mm-hmm. Well, you've certainly got | a nice fiinishing job on your hands. - Yeah, I sure have. | - You're gonna need a bracer before you face those girls. Come on. | How about a nice mint jalopy? Oh, darn it. | She's got me saying it now. - Dorita, what have you done | with Sergeant Mason's picture? - Sergeant who? - Sergeant Mason- | the picture that was in this frame. And Casey's picture, it's gone too. | What have you done with it? Dorita. Dorita, | what are you up to? Okay, I guess the jig is down. | I might as well make a clean chest of it. Your picture and Vivian's picture | is the same picture. - What are you talking about? - Sergeant | Mason is Sergeant Crazy and vice-a-vice-a. You and Vivian both got same sweetheart | between you. - Dorita, you know, I think you're a little- | - No, no, I'm not little. I'll show you. Give me this picture. | You don't believe me, huh? I'll show you. Look. | There's your Sergeant Crazy. And I wash my face | of the whole business. Find it, Eadie? Andy's picture. | Then she did have it. - Are you, uh-Are you sure it's Andy? | - Huh? - Well, I mean- | - Well, of course it's Andy. Isn't he handsome? I wonder what made her | do a thing like that? I don't know. | I guess it was just one of her tricks. Oh, clowning, huh? Yeah... clowning. Dorita! Where's Eadie? Oh, it's you. Shame on you, | you Dr. Jekylls and Mr. Hydes. - Then Eadie knows. And Vivian? | - I just spilled the cat out of the beans myself. - You did. Gee, what'll I do? | - I don't care what you do. I know what I'd do if girl | take my man away from me. - What do you mean? | - I break her into little hunks... and then I break him | into little hunks. And then I take | all the little hunks and, uh- Well, good-bye. | I must do some rehearsalings. Vivian! Andy, darling! Oh, let me look at you, you wonderful guy | with decorations and everything. Hug me again. Closer. It's good to have you home again after all | these months. I bet you didn't miss me. Or did you? | Well, come on. Tell me. Andy, darling, | what's the mat- Oh, Eadie, don't go. | Come here. This is my Sergeant Mason | I've been talking so much about. How do you do, | Sergeant... Mason? How do you do? - Well, aren't you going to introduce us? | - Huh? Oh, uh, this is | Sergeant Pat Casey. - Miss Potter and Miss Allen. | - Pleased to meet you, I'm sure. Sergeant Casey has been helping me | with my correspondence. Receiving certain letters for me | and handing them over. - Certain letters? | - Yes, you see, well, it's- That's right, Vivian. | You might as well know now. This is my Sergeant Casey. We were gonna | keep it a secret, weren't we, Pat? - Were we? | - Why, Eadie, they did know each other in Australia. - Uh-huh. | - Isn't it a small world? - Yeah. | - Oh, Andy, listen. I have to run now. | I'm in the show and I have a rehearsal. So you'll excuse me, won't you? Oh, uh, why don't you all take a walk or something. | You and Eadie can get acquainted. Pat and I have so much to talk about. | Haven't we, Pat? - Have we? | - Oh, that's all right. Andy won't mind. | See you later, kids. Eadie- Pat, why don't you go watch the rehearsals. | Maybe some of the girls need hooking up. Eadie, where are you going? - What difference does it make? | - A lot. I'm sorry, Eadie. | Desperately sorry. - I was going to tell you, honest I was. | - Tell me what? About this whole thing, Vivian and me. | It doesn't mean anything. Just childhood sweethearts, that's all. | The families, you know. - I bet if you even ask Vivian, she'd tell you- | - She has told me. How much? Plenty. - Do you remember that night in the canteen? | - Uh-huh. I told you you were sweet. I meant it. | You were sweet. And you still are, Andy. But just because you guys | over there go through a lot of- Well, never mind. But what do you suppose the girls you | leave behind think of after you've gone? - Their man. | - Yeah, I guess they do. I don't have to guess. | I know. - I wrote you every day, didn't I? | - Yeah. At night I couldn't wait to get through | at the club so I could get home to write. I know you did. - How do you know? | - I just know, that's all. Yeah, you know. You men know everything. You can tear a girl's heart right out | of her and cut it up into little pieces. A girl knows that. | Every girl knows it. And that's why I'm gonna let | Vivian go right on through... even though | the stop signal's against her. - But, darling, you- | - I'm doing it because she- she believes in you. She loves you, Andy. No girl with understanding | would ever let another girl down. But you can't do this, Eadie. | I- I love- You love yourself, Andrew Mason. Why don't you try sitting | back among the crowd for a change... instead of up close | at the ringside. Oh, that's wonderful, Tony. | Do you really mean it? - Certainly. | - Then I'll go. - But what about your engagement to Andy? | - You leave that to me. - Splendid. | - See you after the show. - Okay. | - Oh, Eadie, isn't it wonderful? I'm on my way to Broadway. | I'm going to New York with Tony De Marco. - I'm his new dancing partner! | - What? I don't know what the folks | will say, about Andy, I mean. Of course, it's only a family affair. | We never really loved each other. - You mean that- | - Well, even Andy knows that. Anyway, the folks started it. | Let them work it out. - Eadie, come on. They're waiting. | - There's something I have to do. I know- the fiinale. You can't keep | those children waiting all night. But you don't understand. It's your son. | I have to tell him something he doesn't know. Then he's the only one who doesn't. | But just in case, I'll tell him. You will?
