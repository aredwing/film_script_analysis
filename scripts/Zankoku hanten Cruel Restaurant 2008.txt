I'm at Nakai Beach right now. What?! An interview?! Right now?! Oh, Chief, stop it! Eh? A dumpling restaurant? Everyone's raving about their Tougen Dumplings. Yeah... But there's something fishy going on. Something's fishy? Something's fishy? Lower your voice. Sorry. Well? How does it taste? Really delicious! Really! Give me yours if you don't want them. How do they make these dumplings? These dumplings... The filling... May I have a dish of dumplings? Yes! Sorry for making you wait! CRUEL CRUEL RESTAURAN Hey... Are you all right? Of course not! Well, what's the matter? How can you ask that?! How did the dumplings taste? I've forgotten already. I can hardly believe they'd use such meat... as a filling. Yeah, though I haven't got any evidence yet. The cook in the restaurant must have killed somebody. Are you Mr. Chin of Tougen Restaurant? Yes, I am. What's the matter? What's inside the box? Meat. What kind of meat is it? Who are you? Are you in the restaurant business? We are... Who are you? It doesn't taste as good as people say. It's great! It's really nice. I've never eaten anything as good as this. Right? Yeah! Really? Welcome! Table for one? Yes. This way please. Yes. Please call me if you need anything. May I have a dish of Tougen Dumplings? Yes, sure, thank you! A dish of Tougen Dumplings! You next... Stop it! Don't mess with my restaurant. Mr. Goro, are you okay? Why didn't we tell him we're police detectives and accuse him of interfering in our investigation? Hey! What are these dumplings made of? I'm a food columnist. Don't try to fool me; I'll see through your lies. What is the filling in the dumplings?! Is there some problem with the filling? Of course not, it's just meat. Don't lie to me! Try it yourself! Come on! Hey! Tell me now! Hey! Tell me now! Hey, you! What are you doing with my dumplings? Is there some problem with the dumplings here? You're trying to swindle me out of my recipe, aren't you? You don't need to pay! Get out! Tougen Dumplings! You'll regret this! Out of my way! Thank you, Mr. Chin. It is my duty to protect you, Ms. Lin. We're sorry for the disturbance. Please accept my dumplings as an apology. I'll get them for you immediately. Sorry... Sorry... Ms. Lin... well... Dammit... Ms. Masumoto! I'm Shirizawa; I've interviewed you in the past. I've forgotten about it. I'm Shirizawa from Truth Magazine. I've interviewed you in the past. The topic was "Dinners of the Rich". Are you writing a review of your own? Is there some problem with the dumpling filling? It's strange for a food columnist specializing in high-class establishments to visit a dumpling restaurant. I guess you want to find out what kind of tastes the public is fond of, especially if it might mean we'd lose our jobs. It may not be what you think. No, I think that's it. So, any problems? My sister has been missing. She disappeared after reviewing that dumpling restaurant. As my investigation continues, I'm finding that restaurant increasingly suspicious. What makes you say that? They make the dumplings from the corpses of people they kill. You're joking. My sister must have been killed at that restaurant. An arm was discovered at the beach. Someone was murdered and then dismembered. We'll be very busy. Ah! The waitress at the dumpling restaurant is very pretty. The number of people living near that restaurant is shrinking fast. We can't do anything without evidence. He won't confess to it even if we arrest him on other charges! Let me go! You're as impetuous as ever. What do you want? I want information. She works at the Tougen Dumpling restaurant. Do you think that restaurant is suspicious? Do you know something about it? I don't know. Leave me alone. Chief, the dumpling restaurant is really suspicious. The police have even started keeping an eye on them. I have some clues already. An arm was found at the beach today, possibly belonging to the sister of food columnist Hoemi Masumoto. Yeah... Of course not, I didn't tell the police. I'm ready, Ms. Lin. I am going to try making the dumplings with these meats today. Please try one. How is it? It's not quite right. I used three different kinds of pork as well as thirty percent mutton. Oh, yeah! The meat you brought me last time was really good! The meat I brought you? Oh, I don't remember. But... Your Tougen Dumplings are really good, Ms. Lin. They could be better. Master Hoi said... "The taste of Tougen Dumplings has changed over the generations." I want to make it even better. I've told you not to come here again, haven't I? I'm not coming as a customer today, but as the chef of Daisangen. To be your apprentice! No, please let me be your apprentice. Why not?! Do you want money? I can give you money! Get out! It is not a matter of money! Please let me apprentice here! That's... Those dumplings... They smell really nice. You can't cook anymore without your fingers. You'll regret this soon. Don't worry. I was born in Tougen. I will safeguard Tougen always. If you want to succeed in the business of Tougen Dumplings, you must put more effort into your cooking skills. Listen, Ms. Lin. If you want to make Tougen Dumplings popular, it is very important that you practice your whole life. Use your finest skills and the best ingredients to reach the peak of culinary art! The best ingredients... Please! Please! I won't change my mind no matter how many times you beg. No... Then, let's solve it by force. You won't accept me even when I beg. Who the hell are you, bastard?! You bastard, you ruined my plan. I won't give up until you accept me as an apprentice. Are you okay? Yes... Thank you very much. What are you doing? I'm just going in the same direction as you. You first, then. I'm very interested in your dumplings. Are you going to tell me that you want to be my apprentice? Is the scary-Iooking man your husband? I'd better ask your husband directly. I'm the boss. Mr. Chin is my employee. I asked you a question first. Are you using any low-quality meats? What happened to you, Ms. Lin? Are you okay? Mr. Chin... A man just told me something strange. Do you mean the one from Daisangen? No... So, who then? No... What did he say? I don't even know him. I was attacked by the man from Daisangen. He rescued me. You were attacked?! Who? Who attacked you? I'm all right now. But then... Are you using any low-quality meats? Have you killed anybody in the past? And the dumpling filling you use... We've never done it, right, Mr. Chin? Of course not! We've never done such things. We don't have to. You look very tired, Ms. Lin. Why don't you rest today? No, I'm fine. We haven't killed anyone. What a strange guy... Shall we get started? She wasn't pretending. Her reaction was quite real. She wouldn't have reacted like that if she were lying. If she didn't lie... Then Chin... Sorry to interrupt... May I have some of your time? Mr. Chin! Mr. Chin! Mr. Chin... Long time, no see! I only want to know what you use as the filling. I have to find out on my own because you won't accept me as your apprentice. Get out of here immediately! If you don't, I won't forgive you! I'm not going anywhere. The restaurant will close without you. It's painful... very painful... very painful... It's painful, bitch. Bitch! You're all bastards! Stop it! Let's make some food. First, some salad dressing... Let's add some eggs... And now some ketchup... It's great! It seems we don't have enough dressing. It must be delicious! They're yummy, yummy... Why don't we make some dumpling wrappers? Just a little bit more... Mix it well... Mix it well with your heart. Mix it well... and then take in these wrappers! And now... That Chin didn't say a word. Why did you arrest him so suddenly? Aren't you the one who told me not to arrest him until we had evidence? You're going too far. The best ingredients... The best dumplings... What does it mean? When I started this dumpling restaurant, I decided I must visit the legendary Master Hoi to learn how to make the tastiest dumplings. Are you Master Hoi? Please accept me as your apprentice! I don't take on apprentices. It must have been a hard hike. I am so sorry. But that's... I want to make dumplings as tasty as yours, Master Hoi! My dumplings are called... Her thighs! Now, now... Don't cry, I'll let you be my apprentice. Really?! My dumplings are called Tougen Dumplings. If you want to master the technique, first you should... Here... Here! Feel it with your fingers. That's right, like that. Yes, like that. There! Yes, you're doing it right. Yes, yes, again! That's it! That's it! Correct! That's it! That's it! That way! Yes, that's the Tougen way! That's it! Is anybody here? You understand quite a lot about Tougen Dumplings. In the 19th century, Melanesia found the flesh of foreigners to be the most delicious food. They would beat the foreigners to death after catching them. Then, they would remove the clothing from the corpses and roast the bodies. The wrists and thighs were considered the tastiest parts. This is not the 19th century! I must revenge my sister! Mr. Chin! Mr. Chin! Mr. Chin! What's the matter, Ms. Lin? Please start making the dumplings as soon as possible or you'll be late. Hurry up, go take a bath now. Yeah... Sure... Please... Please tell me how to make Tougen Dumplings. You killed me. KILLED! KILLED! KILLED! KI LLED! KI LLED! Hurry up! I may have killed them... and then used their flesh to... Please help! What can I do?! You're the only one I trust now. Your eyes didn't lie when I first met you. I don't know! I don't remember... I don't believe you've killed anyone. The expression in your eyes tells me that you haven't. Where did you go, Ms. Lin? I was so worried about you. I had something to deal with. Mr. Chin, what is that? This is the meat for next week. It's bleeding. Because it's so fresh. You've already cooked some Tougen Dumplings. I wanted to try something new for tomorrow's dumplings. Here you go. Wow! You've improved so much! Really? Really delicious! You really did great, Ms. Lin! How did you make them? Nothing special... So delicious! Wonderful... Master Hoi... Wonderful! Give it to me! No, please stop it, Master Hoi! Why are you doing this?! Listen! Experience is needed for cooking. You cannot make Tougen Dumplings if you don't understand men. I want to try your dumplings so badly! What's the matter, Ms. Lin? Are you all right? You're acting strangely these days. You had sex with me. That's why you improved so much. You used my flesh. Ms. Lin? Ms. Lin, what's wrong? Are you okay? Hello? Ah, it's me. It's me! Cops never say things like that. What did you say? Work with me. Goro's been investigating alone recently. I don't want to lose. I have an idea. This is Ms. Chie. I'm Detective Iwanomoto of the local police. Nice to meet you! She's the one you need. She eats a lot. Ms. Chie... Right, I understand. If Ms. Chie eats as many Tougen Dumplings as she can, they will run out of filling for the dumplings. They'll have to find some more flesh. We'll follow him and then arrest him when he tries to kill someone. You're so pathetic. Are you going to be okay? No problem! I'll sneak into the kitchen and get a scoop while you're tailing him. Good idea. Ms. Lin, the dumplings are sold out. I'd like another order please. Sorry! We're sold out! We're really sorry! What, no more? What a pity. She ate too much. Hey, that's not fair. Wake up. Yeah... It's morning already and no one has come out. Mr. Chin? Be careful! Yeah... I saw it, Goro. I'm going to write up my scoop now! Then I'll report to the police station, so see you then. Sorry to wake you up. Hey, what's going on? I'm sorry. It's about the secret of that dumpling restaurant. Huh? Hey! What are you doing? What's the matter?! No! No! Hey, what's happening?! You are so dirty. Let me clean you up! You will be very beautiful! Very beautiful! Hey, Toshiko! Hey, open the door, Toshiko! Ms. Lin... You've been here all along? Where is Chin? Where is he? Please leave now, Ms. Lin. Mr. Chin... It's all because of you. I am the guardian of Tougen. I will protect you, Ms. Lin. You killed them all, Mr. Chin? Why did you kill them? And after you killed them, you used their flesh. Yes, I killed them. I killed them in order to protect you, Ms. Lin. In order to keep your secret! I killed them because I am the guardian of Tougen. You really used their flesh? You are all wrong. Tougen Dumplings do not need human flesh. Human flesh is very dirty! If I used their flesh, then Ms. Lin would be dirty too. Protecting Ms. Lin is my duty! Hey... Hey... Ms. Lin... Mr. Chin, stop killing! Are you all right? Ms. Lin? Ms. Lin... You've met another man, Ms. Lin? Another man?! Did you have sex with him? You must have had sex! You must have! Bastard! You bastard! What should I do?! What should I do?! What should I do?! What should I do?! What should I do?! WHAT SHOULD I DO?! Will you have sex with me? Pretty please? Have sex with me! Pretty please, pretty please! It's great! It's great! It's really great! Well, how is it? No! Well, how is it? Your chest is jiggling! What?! Why? Why? Why won't my penis rise? Can you help me out? It won't rise! It isn't rising! Come on! What's going on? It's useless... It won't stand erect. Ms. Lin, goodbye. I will teach you how to make Tougen Dumplings. Any problems? No! Then, take off your panties. Take off your panties! Now, sit down. Don't cover yourself. Open your thighs wide. This is the way of Tougen Dumplings. This is the secret to making Tougen Dumplings... Goro... How's the taste of my new Tougen Dumplings? Really delicious. I found some fresh meat. That they've become so delicious is all because of you. I'm counting on you from now on. THE END
