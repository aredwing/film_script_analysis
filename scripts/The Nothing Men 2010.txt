Somebody fucking bet. Alright, I'm thinking. I know when you got a good hand. Grow some balls kid. Fuck you. Want your mommy bring you some tissues tomorrow? Get mommy to pack some for you. Leave my mother out of it. At least I'm not trying to look like her. What's that supposed to mean? That's why you grew that mustache, so you can look like your mother. Fucking hilarious. Simon. Smoke that shit near the window. Man, it stinks. What did I tell you about smoking that crap in there. You fucking go outside. If they find out, you can kiss the redundancy goodbye. So what man. If it happens, it happens. If it does happen, we will all get in the shit and none of us will get our money, and then I'll chop off your fucking manhood and turn you into a girl you little fucking junkie prick. How will you do that? Have a look around. We're in a workshop. Plenty of sharp instruments. I've been looking for something to hang from my rearview mirror. Oh you just want to play with them, you fucking fag. I'm not a fucking fag. You always say that just because I don't have a girlfriend. It doesn't mean I'm gay. I'd love to be in the arms of a beautiful woman. Who wouldn't? How would you feel if you were some short, balding, hairy little Italian dude, man. (Puking noise) (Laughter) What's so funny? Nothing. What does short, balding Italian have to do with having a girlfriend? Everything. Grease, hairy back, smelly breath. Socks down the undies. What do you mean, socks down the undies? I've been on modeling assignments. Oh here we go. I still get work. Modeling what? Long johns, grandpa shirts. Shut up. Bullshit. I was backstage at this gig once right? Getting changed and this Italian bloke just walks in. I mean, gold chains slicked back hair. His jeans are so tight he can hardly walk and there's this bulge down the front of him. I mean, you should've seen the size of it. I'm talking horse genitals. Bullshit. I never wear tight jeans. You don't wear tight jeans, but you do have horse genitals. I'm just saying that loverboy here makes up stories because he's bored. I'm not making anything up. Can we please get on with this game. I've been waiting for a chance. Why do they put socks down their pants? We don't you drug fuck little dickhead. They put socks down their jeans so chicks think they got a huge cock with a big bulge. Obvious. They're stuffed aren't they? Say, she's like impressed by it. She takes him home. The pants drop. The socks all fall out. And she is left with four little wrinkles and a knot. Give you Italians a bad name. How many times have I got to fucking tell you that that is fucking bullshit! Ooh. We've all seen big bulge down your pants. How many pairs you got down there? Three pairs? Fuck off. You got a big sock drawer? You got a sock drawer Vince? (Laughter) (Chatter) (Chatter) Speaking of horse genitals. Is that all yours? If you are a fag, your mate's in trouble. That will shut you up. If you don't mind me, I'm gonna take the little monster here for a squirt. (Zipping) Don't let it hit the water, Vince. It'll be a tidal wave. (Laughter) (Ominous music) (Ringing) (Beep) Hello, six board Radundo workers slowly going crazy. Jack speaking. Hey, Percy, how are you? Your redundancy manager has come through. You got two weeks to go. You fucking beauty. He's the flip side. There's a new bloke being transferred to your workshop. Who is he? Management won't tell me. I know this much. How many men? Can't you find out who he is? It wouldn't want to be. Yeah right, Percy. Keep in touch on this one, right. OK. (Beep) (Soft music) (Chatter) You don't drink. You don't smoke. Alright, I want to talk to your blokes. Vince, unplug the hippy. What man? Hey shut up! Quiet! This is important. That was Percy on the phone. The good news is they're processed our paperwork in two weeks and we get our redundancy money and we are out of here. (Cheering) Thank god for that! This has been the longest six months of my life. Feels like I was born here and haven't left. Alright, I got some bad news. As you know, the company has six workshops statewide with workers made redundant. One hundred and forty people. Anyway, as of yesterday, twelve men were fired from King's Grove workshop. How can they be sacked if they're redundant? Some were sacked for leaving the premises during working hours. Others for drinking and gambling. Sounds a bit like us, hey? Seems to me that the counts are trying to find legitimate ways to sack people rather than pay them out. This is bullshit. I wanted to keep working but they wouldn't let me. We all did, Des, but supposing there was an accident. We would not only get our redundancy payout, but we'd also get a huge fucking compo payout as well. That's the last thing those pricks in the head office want. Hold on. So, they're paying us our normal wage every week. Just for sitting on our ass and doing nothing. Yet, they are purposely sacking people to save money. The company must be in some deep financial shit. It appears so. Now they're trying to make up for it at the worker's expense. Have they got all these workshops under surveillance? Percy seems to think that the company has actually got spies in the workshops which brings me to the clincher. There is a bloke being transferred from the same workshop tomorrow. He will be here for the duration. From King's Grove? Who is he? I have no idea. Sounds very much like a spy to me. You've done a great job for the company. David, good luck at Berma street workshop. Thank you very much. Mr. Henry. Oh, I almost forgot. The foreman's name is Jack Simpson. Very well. (Ominous music) (Click) There is no way that I'm jeopardizing 180 grand. Fuck that. Fifteen years I've given. Past six months, I've sat down like some puppet just as some greasy company ass could come along and fuck it up. No way. We're talking about our future. He might be one of us. I don't know. And he might not be. Can't you find out who he is? Percy doesn't know. All he knows is he's being transferred here so he can be closer to home or something. They want us to believe that? There's no way he'll be able to put up with you assholes. We're gonna lose it for sure man. What about you? What about you? How's he gonna put up with you wincing every day. Oh, don't mess my hair. I'm modeling tonight. You're the one that's a fucking fag. If I was a fucking fag, I wouldn't go near you. Fuck you. Model prick! Virgin wop! (Laughter) What the fuck are you laughing at junkie? (Laughter) (Rustling) Vince stop it! You do that in front of the new bloke, we'll be fried for sure. Like I care. Anyway, he's gonna fry us smoking that shit all the time. That's it Simon. No more smoking this shit! Come on man. This is bullshit. What are you doing? This isn't bullshit. We all stand to lose a lot of money. You're just paranoid. He's a spy, alright? Maybe we're overreacting Jack. I mean, the guy could be legit. He may just be one of us. We're not taking any chances. Make the most of today boys. We clean up later. As of tomorrow, we sit here like statues for two weeks. This prick is getting nothing on us. (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) Jack, how would you describe sex? Sex is the most fun you can have without laughing. Women are funny creatures. Treat them like a lady. With respect. Compliment. Tell them a few jokes. They love humor. Believe me, it works. They'll line up on you. Buy them things. They love being showered with gifts. Show them that you love them and you'll be rewarded. You'll both be out on the street. You're a fucking smart ass, aren't you Jack? No, I'm just a mate that has an opinion. Nobody wants to hear it. Maybe not Des, but what do you think these blokes if they knew their wives were being fucked right under their noses. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about? Shut up! (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) The bloke down the street might know better jokes. (Honking) Ah, munchies. Finally! (Laughter) Can I have two sausage sandwiches, two pies with sauce, a packet of chicken chips, two strawberry milks. You sure eat a lot for a little guy. Des, this must be killing him. I wouldn't put up with it. Look it. I can't believe you and Louise are doing it man. She's just beautiful. I think she could finally be the one. Really? Absolutely. (Laughter) Hello. How are you? Good. Did you miss me? Mmm-hmm. How much? That much. Sorry Vince. The usual? (Crinkling) What are we doing tonight? As long as I'm with you, I don't care. Three fifty please Vince. (Crinkling) (Laughter) (Jingling) (Laughter) You're the biggest spunk in the world. You are. (Ominous music) (Rain) (Rain) (Screeching) (Heavy breathing) (Soft music) (Soft music) The inlaws last night Des. I swear the old dragon is getting uglier. I spent last night in bed with Louise. You're joking. Did you have sexual intercourse? No, I wouldn't let her. Of course we had sex! What is she like? Does she do everything? The works mate. Does she pop? You're cumming in your pants Vince. Go to the bathroom. Sex is all in the mind. Just don't think about it. Especially you Vince. What do you mean, especially me? Let's face it, you're a garden gnome and if you keep thinking about the beaver you're only going to go crazy. Why? Because you won't be getting any. Why not? I just told you. Your appearance is your main obstacle. Obviously, there is no mirrors at your place, Des. What's that smell? You been smoking that shit again? You were warned yesterday. The new bloke turns up and smells that shit we're all fucked. Don't let him out! (Intense music) You think it's a joke, don't you. You're a selfish little girl. Put him in the vice on the bench. I worked all my fucking life for this. You're not gonna fuck it up. (Groaning) You were told yesterday, weren't you? Yes. You know, what I'm going to chop off. You do, don't you? Here it comes. Here it comes. You little prick. I'm serious. It's gonna happen boy. That's enough Jack. No it's not enough Wesley. We got two weeks to go and this bitch is gonna fuck it up for all of us. She knows the new bloke is a spy and he could walk in here at any time. Alright, sweet cheeks. That's your fun for today. Here you go. Can't spend all day amusing you. Now, did you like that one? Was that a good one? Thanks. Having a bit of fun are we? Who's Jack? I am, why? I believe you used to be the foreman. I'm Dave. Well, this looks very cozy. Very nice indeed. What else do you do to amuse yourself? Drink a bit of beer do we? What do you mean? Nothing, it's just the empty can under the bench. Is the phone in the office Jack? Well, who do you want to call? That's personal. Get the fucking can. Get it. (Scraping) Who's he fucking calling? Head office, no doubt. Just sit still and do nothing. Keep that can in your pocket. His word against ours. Hello Maggie. Hello. It's me. I'm here. Bye. (Beep) Here he comes. Who's chess set? I love chess. It's Wesley's man. He's unbeatable. Is that right? I don't know about that. Would you like a game Wesley? I love a good challenge. They really tested me at King's Grove. Fantastic. Black it is. (Soft music) (Soft music) Try to play as much as I can. I play my son Garreth most nights. Well, when he's not at soccer training. He must be quite the player. Yes. How old is he? Fifteen. Seventeen. Beats me almost every time. Everything I have taught him. Checkmate. Well played. Would you like another game Wesley? There's still plenty of time before lunch. What you worried about lunch for? You can eat any time you want. I'm going home for lunch Jack. Nobody is allowed to go home or leave the workshop. Not even during lunch time. Company rules. Yes, I know the rules. I've got permission. Who the fuck from? Management. How'd you get permission to leave the workshop but nobody else can? It's personal. Which hand Wesley? Let's try that one. That's the white. (Ominous music) (Nature noises) (Beep) Female voice: Hi there David. It's only me. Just letting you know, I'll pick up Garreth from soccer training tonight OK? I thought we'd visit mom on the way home. Dinner is in the oven. See you soon sweetheart. Bye. (Click) (Ominous music) (Ominous music) (Click) (Rattling) (Running water) (Ominous music) Kings Grove. He gloated about it. We all did see. I'm going to the toilet. No way Simon. Can't trust you anymore. I really need to take a dump man. That's what you said yesterday. I know, but this time, it's true man. Bullshit. Sit down and shut up. (Slam) Morning gentlemen. Um, you playing Simon? No, you sit here. I'm just going to the toilet anyway. No you're not. I really need to take a dump man. You just cross your legs and sit on your perch or something. Put your music on but and stay out of the shit house. Fucking fascists. Why can't he go to the toilet? Is there a bomb in there or something? How did you know? He said bomb, dickhead. Bomb. Simon has a masturbation problem. What's the matter David? Your boy seventeen. He has taken it up by now, wouldn't he? Plays a bit of soccer, doesn't he David? Ah yes, he's very gifted. He's a great soccer player. I bet he is. Oh, he's played representative last two years Jack. The coach believes he'll play for Australia one day. Let him play such a sissy game like fucking soccer. Should be ashamed of yourself. He loves it. If he wants to play soccer, I'll let him. What if he wanted to do ballet or something? Let him do that? Of course I would. I mean, if that's what he wants. I love him. Well, soccer is not far off ballet. So my next question is what would you do if you caught him being hit up the backside from another bloke? What do you mean? Planted. Potted. Fucked. So, you're asking me what would I do if my son was homosexual? I love my son very much. If he was homosexual, so what? He's still my son. Alright then. Alright then, say supposing your son was ready for the redundancy after twenty years and the timing was perfect for him to take it, but then some snitching asshole came along and got him falsely fired before he was able to receive it. How would you feel about that? I'd feel very disappointed for him. Twenty years is a long time for... Oh that's disgusting. That's disgusting. (Gagging) Oh man, I got a back log. You got a log up your back. Something crawled up his ass and died. (String music) (String music) (Squirting) A day and a half and I've had a gut full and a half of this prick already. Mister fucking personal. I like him. You would Wes. You've done nothing but kiss his ass since he got here. No Jack. I haven't. All I've done is play him in chess. What's wrong with that? Everything. He's responsible for getting people sacked and you're sucking up to him. Why would I do that? Because he's a fucking spy and you want your money. I don't think he is. Bullshit. Bullshit. He walks right in here, has a look around, makes a phone call and takes off for lunch. What's that if it's not a spy? And he has permission from management. Anyone tell us why he's going home if that's where he goes? And how do we know he hasn't lagged on us for trying to turn shitty ass into a girl. Alright, so we don't. I'm treating him like I treat everyone else. Look, well I'm not getting any one dictate my behavior. He can get fucked. He dictated the minute he first turned up. Soon as he walked in. Bullshit. Just be yourselves. Just sit here till three thirty like we do every day and go home. What's so hard about that? The man is right Jack. What's the use in worrying about it? Let's just be cool and save the time out. You haven't been here fifteen years. You're not getting as much as me. Getting plenty Des. Just ask Louise. You don't think you're the only one fucking her, do you? She's probably been shared. You know what it's like to share, don't you Des? What did you say? I said the bloke on the street loves when you share. (Slam) Get off him. You dick head. Fucking stop. Stop carrying on. That's enough, alright. That'll do it. Jesus, Des. You can't lose it every time. You keep telling everyone. I haven't told anyone about Jeannine, have I? Who's Jeannine? Jack's 14-year-old pregnant daughter. (Slam) You bastard. I'll kill you you wanker. Boys. Fuck. (Slam) Alright boys. That'll due for scrum practice today. More training afterwards. Where's the ball? We'll have a game of touch after work, alright? Alright Des? Yep. (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Ominous music) They call him Percy. They found out that he was at King's Grove a week before he was transferred here. And during that week, the man was sacked. Can't Percy find out who he is? He's been trying. A lot of fucking secrecy going on. So, how's this work David. Are the men OK? So far, Mister Henry. Percy Evans from middle management called it Jack's workshop. The foreman. Not for much longer. When this is finished, your bonus will be waiting. (Traffic) Oh I'm sorry. Come on Wesley. Your turn. It doesn't matter who he is. If just sit here without casting dispersions on each other, everything will be fine. Dispersions. What the fuck does that mean? There has been more fighting going on here since he arrived then ever before. Why don't we just ask him if he's a spy? Don't be a dickhead. He won't tell us. Spies. Spies. Sit here like a scorpion. What do you think Wes? Just be nice to each other. I'm sick of being nice. So am I. It's not for much longer. Get some good night choice. (Ticking) (Dripping) (Ticking) (Slam) Spies can start when they like, hey? Morning everybody. Morning Dave. Wesley. Ah, you're all set up. I have some business to attend to. That's OK. Something wrong Wesley? No, just had a big night. Me too. I took Garreth to the theater last night. We saw Julius Caesar. He loves Shakespeare. He can recite whole passages by heart. I've been teaching him since he was seven. Shouldn't boast. It's terrible when you only have one child. You think he's the greatest. I actually played Cassius in school. Ah, the villainous Cassius. I know that virtue being you Brutus as well as I do know your outward favor. What a great speech. The way he plants the seeds of suspicions in Brutus's mind. It's ticking. (Soft music) We are headed for stalemate. Sorry Wesley, we were talking about books. Yeah, I was just saying that I enjoy reading autobiographies. I remember the first one I ever read. Errol Flynn's My Wicked Wicked Ways. (Honking) It's that time already. I'll see you after lunch. Yes. Hey. Hey Simon. What would you like? Uh, Rahman sauce. That's all? That's it. I told Vince I could need some pie. Some pie? (Engine) Where do you really go asshole? I just can't wait until it's over. Saw that guy at the head office the other day. You did? Yeah. Who is he? That's what we want to know. Did you hear that Jack? What? Louise saw David at the head office. Knew it. What are we gonna do now? He's a fucking spy alright. I'll shoot the cunt. He will lose us. I'll break his fucking back. What's happened? David was seen at the head office. How do you fucking like that? I think he's a good guy. Well, fuck him. Fuck him. Fuck them. Fuck them. Wesley, I'm not an authority on religion. But I do know that each one has their own mythology on its origin. I mean, it's quite interesting when you read the contrasting customs of the different religions from the world. I think we all believe in the same god. What causes our religious beliefs? Reactionaries. I think we all started out the same. Each generation goes by. Other aspects which differ then the original beliefs and to some people, difference is a threat. It's interesting. I think that it's very positive that religion can change with times. And when religion becomes a big part of your life and your beliefs, you don't want people coming along and changing the written law of those beliefs. At our local church, we all feel strongly about our existence. Fuck all this bible bashing crap. Come on hey. I'm a good old fashioned atheist but you don't hear me going on about it. Sorry Jack. I was only speaking generally. I didn't mean to try to convert anybody. How can you sit there and talk about god and stuff? I mean, it's all bullshit. It's crap. Look around mate. Where is the prick? I think you missed the point Jack. Oh no, you missed the fucking boat. I mean, I've sat here all fucking week and listen to you babble on about crap. I mean. Tell me something. Tell me something simple. How much are you getting from the redundancy? Along with my super, about 200 thousand. What are you gonna do with it? That's personal. Fucking personal. What are you going to do with yours Des? Take the wife on a second honeymoon and pay for my mother's hip replacement operation. How about you? What I want to do is start a refuge for homeless children. Still have that dream, do you son? Gonna be a lot of happy kiddies out there. Vince? Gonna pay off my mom and dad's food shop and I'm gonna buy them a nice present. Sweet Vince. Sweet. (Slap) We are talking about what we are going to do with our money. First thing I'm gonna do is buy a pound of grass. Work out whose lawn you can fix up. Must be somebody you can share your newfound wealth with Dave. Well, if you must know. I'm taking my boy around the world to all the great soccer venues. I know he'll love it. I only hope you don't end up sacked like those poor buggers at King's Grove workshop. How do you see it David? How do I see what? Our chances of getting our money. What do you mean? You see David. I've been making some phone calls. You were at King's Grove for one week before people started getting sacked. I didn't know any of those people. I was only there because I wanted to go redundant. Hang on. You told us that you were there for twenty years or something. I've been with the company for twenty years. I was a draftsman. In the head office. I didn't know any of those people on the factory floor. We were told they were sacked for drinking, gambling and leaving the premises. How'd management find out about it? Have no idea. Why were you transferred here? I wanted to be closer to home. Why? It's personal. Everything is fucking personal. You see David, we're all friends here. We talk freely. Nothing is personal. Yeah, plenty of things that are private. Things that we don't want other people to know about. Is there something that you don't want us to know about David? No. There is. You go there, people get sacked. You come here, you piss off all the time. What are you doing at the head office? The other day. Nothing. You know something we don't? I've got to make a phone call. Have to make a phone call. Bullshit. What are you doing? Hey, who are you calling? It's personal. Bull fucking shit. Where do you really go at lunch time? Home. Every day? Bullshit. Why is it we can't go home for lunch but you can. I have permission Vince. You're a fucking liar. Why would you get permission and no one else? It's personal. OK, Mr. fucking personal, is there anything that we've done, you think, that warrants the sack? No. Why? Wesley. Let's leave him alone. He hasn't done anything. Bullshit Wesley. Why should we put up with this? He's just waiting here like the rest of us. How do you know? Fuck you Wesley. Maybe you know something we don't. Alright, listen you two. Just listen. I don't get my money, you are fucking dead and I mean dead and that goes for any company snitch. You alright David. I had nothing to do with those men being sacked in King's Grove. I wouldn't do that to anybody. I know. I'm not a malevolent person in any way. I need the money just as badly as they do. It'll be OK. I'll make you a cup of tea. Thank you Wesley. Thank you. Wesley, would you like to come back to my place after work? I could use the company. OK. Good. (Beeping) Hello Meg, it's David. I'm bringing a friend home after work. Could you leave fifteen minutes early please. He needs room. Thank you Meg. (Running water) Maurice. That's Maurice. He's a good neighbor. This may be fate bringing us together like this. Alright. Come in, come in, come in. Make yourself at home. I'll be back in one minute. (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) That's my son Garreth. Ah, very good looking boy. Thank you Wesley. I'd love you to meet him but he's at soccer training until late. Looks like his mother. Yes he does. That's great. Unique chess board. Yes, my wife made it. You want a drink? I'm gonna have a wine. Myself. Soft drink be great. OK. Good, good. Take a seat. I'll be right back. Ready for a game? Sure. Whoo-hoo. I couldn't continue at the university. It's a full time commitment, isn't it? It is. I was committed. I just... couldn't cut it. Do you think you'll go back to university after your redundancy? I've considered it. I don't think I've been played a chess board quite this big. The pieces are remarkably sculpted. Yes. Garreth, he loves playing on it. He's always boasting about how his mother made it. How talented she was. Was? Beverly's gone. She died in a car accident two years ago. Two years. Yes. On the way home from soccer training. Police believe the other car went through the stop sign causing Beverly to swerve and hit a telegraph poll. She was killed instantly. Thank god, Garreth was OK. It's a miracle. Where was it? Five minutes away, at the reserve road. Grove street. Intersection. They were almost home. They haven't found the other driver. He must have known. It was all over the news. Fucking bastard. I'm sorry Wesley. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do you mind if I use your bathroom. Yes, sure. It's down the hallway to your right. (Intense music) (Heavy breathing) (Running water) (Pouring liquid) (Heavy breathing) (Intense music) David, I'm actually gonna get going. Now? Yeah, I just let time get away with me a bit. No, what a shame. Maybe we could play another day. Yes. Yes. You alright to get home? Goodnight. (Slam) (Ominous music) Oh Garreth. Wanna play chess tonight? OK. (Ominous music) (Ominous music) How was your day? (Ominous music) (Ominous music) (Pouring rain) (Honking) (Soft music) (Storm sounds) (Soft music) (Pouring rain) (Loud Honking) (Clanking) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) We had a visitor tonight, Garreth. Wesley. Fine young man. Yes, I know. I know. Female voice: Hi there David. It's only me. Just letting you know, I'll pick up Garreth from soccer training tonight, OK? I thought we would visit mom on the way home. Dinner is in the oven. See you soon sweetheart. Bye. Love you. Female voice: Hi there David. It's only me. Just letting you know I'll pick up Garreth from soccer training tonight, OK? (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Thud) Another groundhog day. Mister personal. He' s late again. If you live so close, why is he always late? It's personal. (Laughter) Looks like Simon smoked some of that shit before he came in today. Looks like he's on that ice stuff or something. Looks like Wesley indulged in something that night himself. Hey Wesley, you have a big one last night? Hey Wesley. Yoo-hoo. Wesley. Look at those eyes. What you been up to? (Slam) Morning. Sorry I'm late. We're not. I had to help Garreth with his homework. Wesley, your watch. You left it on my bathroom sink. I was thinking last night about all this conjecture. I was only at that factory for two days when those men were sacked. I was told that the manager knew for weeks. Told by who? One of the workers. Bill something. Here we go again. What were you doing at the head office the other day? Mister Henry wanted to see me. About what? Just leave him alone. Can't you see that he's telling the truth? What's it to you Wesley? I mean, what are you doing? You fucking him or something? Hang on a minute, he must be fucking you. He turns up to work all chirpy and you turn up with your eyes bulging out of your head. (Laughter) Jack, fuck you. I'm gonna fucking kill you. (Groaning) (Thuds) (Crashing) (Crashing) I've just smashed company property. You can tell on me now. We're all covered. (Laughter) (Laughter) (Crashing) (Laughter) Look. (Laughter) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Beep) Female voice: Hi there David. It's only me. Just letting you know I'll pick up Garreth from soccer training OK? We'll visit mom on the way home. Dinner is in the oven. See you soon sweetheart. Bye. (Beep) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Click) (Tapping) (Ringing) (Ringing) Yes, hello. Hello. Hello. (Soft music) (Crashing sounds) (Alarm sounding) (Soft music) (Soft music) What's the matter Wesley? Your boyfriend lock you out? A lover' s tiff. I think this must be my favorite photograph of you Garreth. You're so cheeky. So beautiful. Handsome little boy. (Thud) Garreth! (Gagging) (Wheezing) (Screaming) What's going on between those two? David. Wesley, you OK? You're a real friend. (Ringing) Excuse me. Hello. It's me. Maggie. One minute. I hate to be a bother Wesley, but can I have some privacy please? Yes Maggie. He's had multiple seizures and he's been vomiting and I'm concerned enough to call a doctor. Just comfort him and I'll be there as soon as I can. David, this can't go on. I'll call Dr. Framon now. (Beeping) (Ringing) Hello, Percy. Mate, who's on the phone? I'm trying to call I have a new bloke, a spy. Don't be silly. He's no spy. His money's through and so is yours. You serious? What's the matter with you blokes? Your money is locked in now. It's been processed. So, Jack, can you please give me some peace. I fucking love you Percy. I fucking love you. Boys, boys, the money is there. We're free. We're free boys. (Cheering) We're rich boys. Listen, um, I have to go home for a while. We'll talk soon. The greatest gift is patience. Patience itself. You know what I think we should do just for a giggle? What? Let's find out what this dick is really about, right? Let's just see where he's going. Buy a couple snails on the way and have one last laugh. Fucking A. I gotta see where he goes. Nice and easy. (Ominous music) (Scream) Not getting away from me. Jailbreak. I got something for us. Woo-hoo! He went left. Come on. I knew he would. Come on Vinnie. (Clicking) That'll kill you. That should do a world of good. Just inhale. (Intense music) Let's go home for lunch. (Laughter) (Intense music) (Intense music) Shit, he does go home for lunch. See! Let's go back and party. Bullshit. I want to see what goes on. I'm here Maggie. Have you called Dr. Framon? Yes, of course. Oh, hello Garreth. Oh, missed you. How was your day? His day has been bad David. He needs to be in a hospital. No, he's fine here with me Maggie. We're taking a trip, aren't we? He can't go anywhere. Look, I'm with him everyday. I change him. I bathe him. I clean him up when he's done. You don't see him like this. You know, David, I love him too. No, I'm his mother and I love him Maggie. Don't we Garreth? You know what dad did yesterday? I smashed a furnace with a sledgehammer. (Laughter) (Crackling) (Intense music) (Rustling) Oh shit. Des, check that out. (Laughter) Shut up. You want to get us caught? Who's that kid? Let's get going. He fooled you. You sat there like imbeciles thinking he was a spy. Only because Jack and Des did you fuckwit. I made a few phone calls. Oh, he's a spy. Shut up you dickhead. We'll see who has the last laugh. We're gonna play chess tonight. You can be white and I will be black. (Intense music) (Engine) Some fucking sports star he turned out to be. Freak.

What would you like to talk about? Tell us some more about your boy. Oh, well, apart from his intelligence, he's a wonderful sportsman. He won his school age swimming championship a month ago. Oh really. We heard maybe he wasn't such a good swimmer, didn't we? Oh and his basketball team won the state championship last year. I bet he jumps really high David. He's magical to watch. Magical. Where's Wesley? Come on David. You're full of shit. Garreth is intelligent and handsome. Like me? No Vince, he's popular with the girls. (Laughter) We all have to face our little secrets sooner or later. Hey, we all had guesses what your boy really looks like. How big and strong he is. Come on David. Last chance to come clean. My boy is everything I told you. Fucking can't help himself. Can he? I thought he looked something like this. (Moaning) (Laughter) We close mate? No. Hey you don't recognize him, do you? (Moaning) See what bullshit can do David? My daddy. I'm dribbling daddy. (Ominous music) Jack, he gets the point. Jack, no more. (Ominous music) Stop it! You have no right to do that. You have no right to do that to my son. Look at you. You're all fucking monsters. Serves you right you prick. Personal enough for you? Get personal. (Engine) Wanker. (Moaning) Must be beer o'clock. What's wrong? You guys are laughing. (Ominous music) (Ominous music) (Laughter) (Ominous music) (Ominous music) (Ominous music) (Ominous music) Tomorrow is the last day Garreth. And it's England, Germany, Spain. Italy. South America and Japan. All the great soccer venues of the world. It's gonna be so much fun. Isn't it? You and me. A father a son. Just like it should be. Boy, that went quick. (Laughter) I'm sorry for the excessive drinking. I really am. I'm just so excited. It's gonna be so much fun. But, it's a good cause for a celebratory drink. Is it your move or mine? I think it's mine. I'll just have one more, OK? I'll only have one more. I promise. I promise just one more. (Moaning) (Gasping) (Soft music) I forgot to mention France. The Eiffel Tower. Almost there. Listen to me Garreth. I speak about it like it's down the street. It's your move sweetie. Garreth. You sleeping? Are you? Come here my baby. Come here. Come here. Daddy's got you. I got you. Daddy's got you. (Soft music) Daddy's got you. Let's pack. Let's pack. Yes. Let's do that. Now, yours was the blue bag. Mine was the green one. It could get cold. Yes, you'll need your hat and your autograph book. You'll have to take your autograph book. You never know you'll bump into. Passports. Garreth, passports. Where did we put the passports sweetie? (Soft music) (Soft music) I love you. (Soft music) I remember you played with the robins outside. You were magnificent. You took their ball. And you ran past everyone in school. Ten seconds to go. Crowd went wild. I was so proud of you. I was so proud of you. (Crying) (Ominous music) (Tapping) (Ominous music) (Ominous music) (Clang) Thought this day would never come. I can't believe it has. I just want to get my hands on that beautiful chick. Don't forget those homeless kids and the refuge camp. No fucking chance man. I hate kids. Hate them. Well, what was yours Des? That's right. Your mother's hip replacement operation. Don't forget that huh? Have to dig her up first. (Laughter) (Ominous music) Look who's here! Looks like he had a big night too. Why didn't he just say his kid was a cripple retard and do nothing but dribble. Must be hard for you Wesley, getting stuck in the middle. Wesley in the middle, holding David's widdle wiping his son's dribble, while he feels him have a biggle. Come on Wes, you're always drinking that fucking tea. Lighten up mate. It's the last day. Have a beer. (Clank) I'm gonna kill all of you. Fuck you Wesley. You little shit. (Thud) Unfaithful little shit. (Groaning) (Thuds) You and you all of you. You torment and your persecute.

I didn't do anything man. I did not do. I don't deserve to die man. She should have died here after. That would have been a time for such a word. Tomorrow, tomorrow. But there is no tomorrow for you. (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Groaning) Wesley! Help! (Gunshot) Terrifying isn't it? Cruelty. Garreth is dead. My son who was all the things I said he was. (Gunshot) (Screaming) And you laughed at him. David, It's alright Wesley. You're my friend. I know you weren't there. My neighbor saw them laughing through the window. Don't man. I'm sorry for Garreth. I really am. (Gunshot) (Groaning) Don't say his name. (Groaning) (Screaming) David! (Thud) Remember this? Rooted. Planted. Potted. (Gunshot) Fucked. (Clicking) (Gunshot) So, you're a proud atheist Jack. Where will you be in fifteen seconds? To be or not to be? Say it. To be or not to be. To be. (Moaning) or not to be. Not to be. (Gunshot) (Ominous music) (Soft music) (Soft music) (Soft music) David. It was me. I was the driver. It was a Wednesday night. It was pouring with rain. My girlfriend broke up with me. I'd been drinking. I know I shouldn't have been drinking. It was a blue car. Yours. The 29th of June I killed your wife. I killed Garreth. David, do you hear me? It was me.
