Who is this? Listen up. There's nothing to it. First, the 60 euros. Second, nobody touches anything. Except me. You wanna touch, you pay more. And nobody goes near my backpack. And by nobody I mean nobody, okay? Let's celebrate your birthday. If life gives you... ...more than five reasons to go on. If life gives you... ...more than five corners to sleep in. If life gives you... ...more than five million to die... ...you strain yourself. Night and day. ...you strain yourself. Night and day. If life gives you... ...more than five bastards to put up with. If life gives you... ...more than five lessons to not go on... ...you strain yourself. Night and day. ...you strain yourself. Night and day. If life gives you... ...more than five reasons to go on. If life gives you... ...more than five corners to sleep in. ...you strain yourself. Night and day. ...you strain yourself. Night and day. ...you strain yourself. ...you strain yourself. - How's it going? - Better. Having lunch with your mother? And give me some pessaries. And four twelve-packs. Supersensitive. Was it Canesten? Yes. Zero kilos. You're so light. That means you're an angel. You have to put a coin in for it to work. It's from a local store. What does it say? "With love. " The fourth one. Must be a neighborhood fan. - Let me see the handwriting. - Wine? He could be from the senior center. What about the guy from the 5th floor? Him? He hardly says hi when he sees me. Exactly. Someone older. Maybe they have the wrong address. What? Mother can't have an admirer? Of course she can. She can have as many as she wants. You get them, that's what matters. We exist because someone thinks about us, not vice versa. Someone said that, I don't remember who. Someone wise. Wise and corny. Aren't you going to answer? What if it's for me? For you? It's my cell phone. Since they keep ringing... It might be important. How's your teaching? She's not teaching anymore. I'm the principal now. Congratulations. That's good, right? Yeah. Since 2 years ago. Really? Congratulations. Maybe it's Dad. Sending the flowers. Why not? Maybe he felt guilty. Maybe. If he hadn't died 3 years ago. That's not certain. You identified him at the morgue. I didn't look that close. I said yes without looking. Mother, please. We didn't check his DNA. With DNA you can tell who it is right away. Dad is dead... ...period. Maybe he ran off with a woman and doesn't dare come back. Hence the flowers. To say he's sorry and thinking of me, without saying it. Your father was always a coward, Cayetana. A good man... ...but a coward. Answer the phone! I get nervous when you don't answer! Who is this? Lima. Lima. No. Why? So they say. Brunette. Average. 100. The works, 100. Blowjob, 50. Anything except in the ass. As long as it takes, half an hour. Half an hour, tops. Who is it? What? What else can I say? At Vidal's on Providencia. They're the worst. The worst, Gloria. Since they came, this is a jungle. They'll fuck for 20 euros. Some even for 15. Blowjobs for 10, like junkies. But guys like them. It must be the novelty. Gloria... I only work half as much since they came. They have to do something. There's no work in their countries. Don't people fuck there? They must have learned somewhere. If they were hairdressers, you wouldn't be defending them. What racists. That's not it. You're wrong. It's not racism. The problem is the market. The laws of the market. Not the supermarket, the other one. It's demand and competition. There's not enough demand and there's no competition. The Minister of Economics said it on TV. They come here and do as they fucking please. The Minister said that? Not the "fucking" part, but he definitely thought it. And he's a minister. He must know what he's talking about. You know more about blowjobs, Caye. But the Minister of Economics knows more about economics. Rosa's the expert on ministers. No comment. And the cops. What good are they? These girls don't even know what working papers are. Don't be mean, Caren. Believe me. If they were lawyers... Have you really screwed ministers? A bit of everything. And ministers too? The secret service followed me and my phone's been bugged... ...so many times... You wouldn't be here if you screwed a minister. You'd have a nice house. Hello? I didn't want a house, but I had plenty of offers. With ducks and everything. Who did you screw? You'd never believe me. How big? How much were these? 2,000 euros. 2,500. The bastard was jerking off. I know where you get a perfect boob job for 1,000. 1,000? If you're going to get one, do it right. But smaller tits are in right now. It gets you more work. Look how she walks... ...sticking her ass out. They learn how to do it as kids. They put stuff in their shoes... ...to make them walk like that. Come on. I saw it on the BBC. And they smell different. Hormones. The strong smell attracts the guys. They don't bathe. It's a cultural or religious thing. Almost finished? Let them wait. Good things are worth waiting for. Like cleavage and a G-string, but in hormones. - Hi, Caye. - Hi. Are you meeting Lima? At five. And it's ten past already. Yeah. I got held up. One minute. Shall we go? You're too late. Couldn't you wait 10 minutes? I came from the other side of town. Give me the bill. At least pay for my taxi. I'm not paying you anything. What about you? Didn't you hear the Minister? Can't you talk? There are rules around here. This isn't the jungle! You come to this country and do whatever you fucking want! Watch. Nothing will happen. They take the one in blue away every 3 days. If they take them away I'll blow them myself. You have loose ends. She's got everything loose. Angela's very loose in general. Well? Why don't you try it? She's got a good ass. You could make some extra cash. Forget it. Another one. Mamen's very popular. Guys like piercings. What about my boyfriend? Look after him. I'm as faithful as they come. I can screw 30 guys... ...and I'm still faithful. It's just a job. Maybe you go to a club with your friends... ...have a few drinks... ...see someone you like and fuck him. Nice and tan. Well-built. With his tongue pierced. I'd fuck him. You see? I wouldn't. Bring him in sometime to meet us. Who, my boyfriend? No way. What does he do? He takes pictures. Of who? I don't know, of nobody. He likes it. Hey! Hey! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hold your breath. I don't have papers. They won't ask for them. If they do, say you left them at home, but they won't. Do I have to pay for this? It's free. Do you know him? From before. He's getting me a work permit. A customer? I fuck him for free. Down payment for my papers. What happened today? I said no. The same thing happened the last time. I had to screw him so he would go. Is he a cop? My friend says he is, but I don't know. Your friend introduced you? Sulema? Where do you buy your clothes? I'll take you one day. He's a bastard. He can't hit you. Press charges. We have rights, you know? They said it on TV. Without papers, I can't. How long you been here? Ten months. I applied for residence. I didn't get it. Are you in the park? That's where I found out about the apartment. From Marga, a Colombian. You know her? I want to move. It's expensive. I have a kid back home... ...with my mom. I send them money. I want to save up and bring him here so he can take care of me. He's handsome. Looks like a little monkey. Edward. Little Edward. Do they know what you do? Mom would die if she knew. I say I work in a bar. What about your family? They don't know either. This is temporary. I'm saving up, too. To buy a pair of tits like yours. What? Did you see him? I saw him on the stairs. I bet it was the mob. She owed them money and they collected. How long has she been here? Maybe she tried to rob him. In her apartment? They're not too bright. Look who's here. Miss Methadone. You're so mean, Angela. Once she was so pretty, she drove the neighborhood crazy. And now look at her. Hi, Gloria. Hi, girls. Can I use your bathroom? It's broken. I'll only be a minute. Try Jose's. I was already there. His is broken, too. Hi, Caye. You look so pretty. How's your morning going? Okay, turned a few tricks already. Gloria, let me in, please. I can't. Fuck, I won't mess it up. It's broken. Piece of shit bathrooms. They're always broken. That's the way it is. Yeah, whatever. See you later, Gloria. I like the ones with cross-straps and with single straps, too. Those are the colors I like. I want this color. Perfectly made, honey. And they're on sale. How pretty! How much? Two for a euro. It's banana leaf with corn and a little meat. You'll love it. Comfortable panties. Flexible ones, light ones, quality ones. Ladies, try them on. Make yourselves at home. Come, sinners, if you're not wearing panties, you're going to hell. Look at these panties! My son's birthday is on the 12th. He's turning five. Take care, okay? Take care. Do everything Grandma tells you. Are you behaving yourself? Mommy misses you a lot too. We'll see each other again soon, you'll see. Real soon, my darling. Listen. How was school this week? How was it? Me too, my darling. Hang on just a little longer. Tell Grandma to sing you the song you like. You'll love it, you'll see. Zulema! It's been so long! How are you? You're nearly as tall as I am. It's been a long time, Walter. How are you? Since Juancito's birthday. The black guy likes you. Forget it. I don't like them. To fuck, I mean. If it's work, I don't care... ...but not for free. I prefer white guys. But it's the same thing. No, it isn't. How could it be? There are differences. Pigments and stuff I won't mention here... ...but you see it in documentaries. I used to feel that way too. It put me off, their whiteness. You do everything? Just about. Me, too. Except swallow, it makes me puke. And not up the ass. Me, neither. I let them watch videos. They come faster. Girl on girl action, cum shots... They freak at the video store. I tell them things. Like what? All kinds of filthy shit. Stick it to me. Deeper. Fill me up with cream. Fill me up with cream? I swear. They love it. I don't know why. Works like magic. I say it and they're off. I'll try it. Fill it up with cream. Fill me up with cream. Fill me up with cream. And always with a rubber, or no deal. Do you take tests? They used to test us at the club, but not anymore. I'm clean. Are you working today? I'm going out. Does it make you nostalgic? What? Everything. The food. A little. Weird, isn't it? Nostalgia. It's not a bad thing in itself. It means you had good times... ...and you miss them. Me, I don't feel nostalgic. Nothing worth missing has ever happened to me. Talk about shitty. Can you feel nostalgic over something that hasn't happened yet? Because sometimes, I do. I imagine how things are going to be... ...with boys, for example... ...or life in general. And I feel sad when I remember how nice they were going to be... ...because they were going to be beautiful... ...really beautiful. Then, I feel nostalgic... ...because they were going to be so beautiful. And when I realize they haven't happened yet... ...that they may never happen... I get really sad. Really sad. It's like a down payment of sadness. Like a deposit on a rented apartment... ...but of sadness. And you advance it because you know eventually... ...you'll use it up anyway. I've got another question. When you're kids do they put stuff in your shoes... ...to make your ass stick out? Who? I don't know. Someone. Whoever. Cream? Yes, please. Cream. - What was it? - Fill me up with cream. Fill me up with cream. Fill us up with cream. Fill us both up! Bring us cream, please! At least let me tell them. I'm with my friends and they're already inside. I don't care. You can't go in. They just went in. A tall guy and two others. They just went in. Nobody's gone in. You just let three guys in. Let him in. Stay out of this. I'm trying to help. - Is he with you? - No, I'm not. I came with friends. They'll be waiting for me inside. Can I go in? No. You see? If you were with me, you'd already be inside. But I don't know you at all. Can I speak with your superior? I don't have a superior. Who are you, God? You're not missing anything. - There's hardly any chicks. - Was I talking to you? No, right? Are you coming? What if they come out? They're not coming out. Why are you alone? I like going out alone. Isn't it boring? At least no one leaves me waiting outside. What's your name? That depends. On what? On the day. I've got two names. Which do you prefer? Which one do you like? Caye. Cayetana, Caye. You're weird, Caye. Do I scare you? A little. Want to go back? What do you do? I work with computers. I'm a programmer. But I want to set up my own business. Like Bill Gates. He started from scratch and look at him. Is he doing well? Well? He's a fucking genius. He built an empire from nothing. You know how hard that is? Very, right? He's a god. He's passionate. That's why he's been successful. You have to be passionate about everything. Computers, life... ...everything. Are you passionate in your work? Very. Great. It's the only way. Like I say, whatever you do, do it with passion. If not, don't bother. - Do you like computers? - The new ones, especially. I can give you software. Design, music... whatever you want. Great. What do you do? I'm a whore. That's funny. A whore. Hilarious. Zulema? Yes? Who is it? Zulema? She's not here. Try again in the morning. I pay half. One shift, until eight. I get it in the daytime. It's called the warm bed because it's never empty. It's better than sharing a place. That's half the time. Some beds you only get for 8 hours... ...just to sleep in. Are they nice? They're from back home. We hardly talk. The less they know the better. They might know someone back home... ...and gossip. Do you like them? Guys like them big, right? Since her operation, Angela's working a lot more. There can be a psychological reaction. Rejection. Self-rejection. Your body says no... ...so you have to get them removed. How does Manuel like them? I don't know. I'll ask him. You might scare him. He's already scared. He's a bit weird. Always talking about computers. I think I scare him. But I like him, he's very funny. You told him? I told him... ...but he didn't believe me. But you told him. If I told him... ...that I was a cashier or whatever, he'd believe me. And you know what really pisses me off? They can't pick you up after work. I'd really love that. I'd work in an office doing whatever, I don't care... ...but I want to be picked up after work. Can you imagine? See him there waiting, from the window. And he's really hot and the other girls are green with envy. Just think. Just saying it is amazing. "Pick me up. " That's what love is, right? Being picked up after work. The rest is bullshit. Forget flowers and rings. They can stick that up their ass. I just want to be picked up after work. Is it the same in your country? Have you ever been picked up after work? A few times. How lucky. Do you eat chicken there as well? Chicken, rice, corn... But we don't eat that much. The heat? No, the government. Do you have cinemas and shopping malls? Mother, please. What? She's from Santo Domingo, not Mars. For me, Santo Domingo and Mars are the same. How long does it take to get there? Ten hours by plane. That's not so far. I thought it would be farther. Who wants dessert? I'll help you, Pilar. Do you miss it? Mostly my son. It might be someone from across... ...because I get them only when I'm home. She gets flowers from a secret admirer. How lucky. It's not your father. He would write something. Maybe he's in Santo Domingo. Is your father away? As away as can be. He's been buried for 3 years. She can't accept it. She misses him. She's lonely, Carlos. - Being lonely sucks. - And she misses him. But they were constantly at each other's throats. They weren't. Are you like her now? You make up whatever you don't like. But they weren't. You just choose to remember it that way. I remember it the way it really was. You left home. You don't know what it was like. It's like the flowers, or am I making that up too? She sends them to herself. She orders them from the florist's. Really? And she writes the cards. In capitals so we won't realize. And they're playing along. They told us to at the senior center. Whatever, Carlos, but it scares me. It's a fantasy. Sending flowers every 3 days. 180 euros of fantasy a month. What does she write? On the cards. What does she write to herself? Do you like sweets, Zulema? A lot. You don't answer either? Why do you even bother buying cell phones? I was telling Pilar we need a lecturer. What's the seminar about? Sex education. I know a lot about that. I've done it a lot. Back home. Seriously? Sex education? I'm an expert. How much does it pay? They're hypnotized. I can do your makeup later. I took a state course... ...in makeup for movies. And another in catwalk modeling but I couldn't keep my balance. How's your balance? Fine. Mine's really bad. As a kid, I was always falling. One day I fell seven times. My mother'd fill my pockets with sand to make me heavier... ...so I wouldn't fall over. So yeah, I couldn't do the catwalk. That's why I love tightrope walkers. I should marry one to make up for it. Are there any in your country? Ten million of them. Like princesses. They're so sensitive they can feel the earth rotating. That's why they're dizzy all the time. Didn't you know? They say they're so sensitive... ...they get sick away from their kingdoms. And they can even die of sadness. All set. Can I look? Do you like it? Do you think Manuel will like it? He's no tightrope walker but I like him a lot. Maybe he's the one. Can you imagine? The man of my life. I'd love to be the woman of his life. Even for just one day. I want to ask you a favor, Zule. It's really important to me. Smell. Perfume. It was in the bathroom. Adobe Premiere 5.1. It just came out. And an Office upgrade. I thought it was music. It looks better on Zule. She has bigger tits than me. Guys like big tits, right? Mine are pretty small. They're normal. Shall I get them done? I'm saving up for implants. How big do you like them? Tell me. I'll get the size you like. The size of your hands. So they'll fit nicely inside. It's yours. Would you like dessert? Tonight I'm your dessert. What's your other name? You said you had two. I can't tell you. Why not? It's my secret identity. No one can know it. Like Superman? Something like that. Are you a superhero? A superheroine. Which one? It's dangerous. No one can know... ...because they could hurt us. You too. I'm protecting you. Thank you. It's my job. Do you change in phone booths, like Superman? Sometimes. Do you have superpowers? Can you fly? Even better. I can make you fly. Manuel. Would you pick me up? Where? After work. Of course. Where? Anywhere. Doesn't matter. Would you? Of course. What's wrong? Nothing. Not anymore. Don't wait for me. What are you doing? Is that guy paying you well? Hey, I'm with someone. Come party with us. I'll pay you well. Let go of me! You got the wrong person. 100 euros to suck me off. No, please, no. Just a blowjob. Not tonight, please. Not tonight. Then jerk me off. Please. Use your hand, like that. I'll come real fast. I swear. 120. 120. Here. - Not tonight, please. -200 and I'll come real fast. - No, please. - I'll come real fast, I swear. Come on, use your hand. Use your hand, that's it. Use your hand. Like that. Squeeze it. Suck my dick. That's it. I know everything. You didn't go to the bathroom. You went to save the world. To stop a train from derailing. You went, saved everyone, and came back. Am I right? Are you okay? Get the check, please. I'm on my way out. No hurry. Stay there. Excuse me. My wife wants me to ask you to please change the sheets... ...after sleeping in them. Why doesn't she do it? Because she's not the one who's screwing 10 men a day in them. She also told me to ask you to leave the house before 8. So that our son won't see you. My darling. Star without a candle. Blood of my wounds. Don't make me suffer anymore. My darling. A stray bullet... ...on Main Street. Puddle in the slums. I don't want you to go. I don't want you to go away. More and more each day. My darling. Star without a candle. My darling. Little puddle of cloudy water. Soap bubble. My last refuge. My last hope. Whore! Fuck you! My darling. Little puddle of cloudy water. Soap bubble. My last refuge. My last hope. I don't want you to go. More and more each day. My darling. You want some? Something good from the Caribbean? I'll give you 20. No, 30. Come on. Asshole! Hey, guys. Looking for company? Hello? Good. No, I can't. Because I can't. I don't believe you. Because I don't. The guy's a piece of shit. He doesn't have... ...any papers for you. He just wants to fuck you... ...period. He's taking them to the Cuesta. Today? At nine. And you're going? You said you'd go? I don't know what to do. He says they're valid for 6 months. Yeah, and he'll get you an apartment. He'll say anything. Whatever you want to hear. The guy's a pig. He's out there fishing. He's got ten others like you... ...who'll lose their shit for papers. Yeah, I'll lose my shit. You can't imagine what 6 months would mean to me. Don't go, all I'm saying is don't go. I'm the one getting beaten, remember? You can't let him beat you up and then run back... ...for more when he calls. What I can't do is stop going out in the street. Or go to see my son because if I leave I can't get back in. Your son needs a mother without papers more than a dead one. Don't tell me what my son needs. You have no idea. Zule! No, how can you think that, Mom? Everything's fine. It's just that I thought about you. Did you get the money I sent? Did you get the money? How's little Edward eating? Is he eating well? Don't give him sweets, Mom. Anyway, Mom. You too, take care. I'll call again soon. Talk to you soon. Bye. How are you? Water. Another one. Can I see them? They've given me a lot of trouble. You have no idea. I needed a duplicate with a signature... And my friend in the registry... ...he's not here. He took a few days off. Can I see them? Did anyone see you? Are you meeting anyone later? I want to see my papers. They're not yours. Remember that. Show them to me. Not here. Someone can see me. Let's go to my place. We have time. When are you going out? Show them to me and I'll go with you. Hello? Okay. Yes. Where? Okay. Okay. Let's go. Where? I'll tell you outside. Do you want your papers? How do I know you're telling the truth? You have no other choice. - Come on. - Let go of me. Walk ahead of me. I'll tell you what to do. Let go. Take it easy! I said let go! Sorry I'm late. Hi. Did he bring them? Who are you? Caye, nice to meet you. And you are? He says at his place. Great. Let's go. Where do you live? Just you. That's the deal. Well? I'll go up. She can wait downstairs. In the street? Just you. I'll go up alone and you get half an hour. - Half an hour in the street? - An hour! Well? Well? Hey! Son of a bitch. The jerk treats me like I stink or something. If you'd left with him, anything could've happened. But I'm left wondering. Wondering what? The usual. Whether he had them or not. It's unhygienic. Whatever they say. And it damages your hair. And you don't do them. I know how. I don't on principle. I didn't say you don't know how, I said you don't do them. On principle. The hairdresser's principle? Hairdressers have principles? Like you and everyone else. You don't screw without a condom, I don't do braids. I don't out of common sense, not principles. Very bad. You should do it out of principle. What's the difference? It's not the same. You can not do something for many reasons. There's a big difference. You look black. Who did these? You're a traitor, Caye. They're comfortable. And I get twice as much work. They don't look good on you. I have to tell you that. She has to tell you that on principle. Right. On principle. Because it's my job. You think principles come free with condoms. But either you have them or not. Not like tits which you can get if you don't have them. I'm gonna charge for touching my hair. Let's give them a fright. What are you doing? It's my job. They're taking it away. Is this the police? Some black girls are fighting. Providencia Street. In the square. Africans. Look like whores to me. She's faking it. No, she's really calling. A neighbor. Three minutes. Thanks. Thanks. How can you be like that? What about them? I'm defending what's mine. Hi, girls. Can I use your bathroom? It's still broken. Just for a minute. It's broken. Fuck, Gloria, I won't mess it up! Come to my place, if you want. I'm heading that way. Cool! See you later. To the right, Blanca. 30, my love. In a hotel, 30. Of course. No, my love, 30. You won't forget it. You'll want to be my boyfriend. Tell me, my love. Okay. Okay. Okay, ciao, my love. Who's Zulema? Are you Zulema? Caye says come right away. It's really important. Come straight over. She's on the corner. Is something wrong? That's all she told me to say. What? What's up? What's up with you? What's up with your friend? I saw you talking to him. I wanted to know if you were okay. Are you okay? Like always. Come to my place? We're going to her bathroom. Gloria's is broken. Lucky you weren't there. Fuck, you're right. If it wasn't for Caye, they'd have busted you. You knew, didn't you? You knew and sent her. Who? They're the ones who called. It was Angela. She's not working. She says it's because of you. The bitches! She wouldn't listen to me. That's the way things are. Maybe for you, not for me. Try to understand. Before she had a lot of work. Why did you warn me then? Don't I take away her work? You're my friend. So why didn't you come yourself? You save her and she complains! Unbelievable! They should have taken her too. And fucked her up. Do you have Chanel? Perfume? Can I try it? Thank you. Smells great. It's number 5, right? Can I try a little more? You weren't here last month, were you? A little more. Thank you. Can I see the bottle? They make them so pretty now. If life gives you... ...more than five reasons to go on. If life gives you... ...more than five corners to sleep in. If life gives you... ...more than five million to die... ...you strain yourself. Night and day. ...you strain yourself. Night and day. If life gives you... ...more than five bastards to put up with. If life gives you... ...more than five lessons to not go on... ...you strain yourself. Night and day. ...you strain yourself. Night and day. If life gives you... ...more than five minutes of pleasure. If life gives you... ...more than five minutes to forget. ...you strain yourself. Night and day. ...you strain yourself. Night and day. ...you strain yourself. ...you strain yourself. Papi? Don't be shy, papito. Papi? No, please. Take it easy. Take it easy. Please. Where are you going? Stay. If I see you around here again, I'll call the police. Yes? How many are you? Two? Together, 100. 100. 50 per head. Where are you? Caye! You work around here? Across the street. Caye... Friends of mine from work. Hi. Hello. How are you? Fine. Like always. I'm meeting someone. Here? A friend. Manuel. I'll be right back. He's the one that gives me the software. What about you? Me? They have liqueurs inside, they're my favorites. That means he knows you well. I prefer flowers, they're less fattening. Have one, Caye. The red ones are delicious. Next week we have to go see Dad. Well, Mom? I don't know if I'm going. Why? It's inconvenient. Anyway, he won't know. But we go every year. That's another reason. If I don't go this time it doesn't matter. And I don't want to talk about it. But we have to talk about it... ...and decide how to do it. And we have to take flowers. Anyone know a florist? Mom? You could get them. Maybe they'll give you a discount. I don't understand you. Obviously you don't. I don't understand you either. There's a day, you'll see. One awesome day. On that day everything is good. ...you see the people you want to see... ...eat your favorite food... ...and everything that happens Is what you want to happen. If you turn on the radio, your favorlte song is playing. If you go on a TVgame show... ...you win everything. Money, trips... Everything. Mark my words... ...everything. It happens once in a lifetime, so you have to be ready. Or you'll miss it. It's like a detour. Llke when you're on a road and come to a detour... ...but you're talking on your cell... ...or arguing or thinking about something... ...and don't realize and you miss it... ...and you're screwed because you can't turn back. Well, that day is the same thing: A detour. And you can choose how things will be from that day on. Either you take the new route, or you don't. That's why we have to be ready, Zule. There are too few good things in life. And if you miss them because you're thinking about something else... ...that would suck. That would really suck. They call me Caye, walking the street. The mischievous, the oh-so-lost. They call me street. Street by night, street by day. They call me street, today so tired, today so empty. Like a little machine walking the big city. They call me street, I get In your car... ...they call me street ofjoy and sorrow... ...aching street, tired street from so much loving. I go down the street, up the street... I won't come down, not even for life. They call me street and I'm proud of it. I know my day will come. Luck will find me some day. One day he'll be there to pick me up... ...after work, that good man... ...my lifelong love who won't need to pay. My heart's not for rent. They call me street. They call me street. Suffering Street, Sad Street from so much loving. They call me street. Street and street. Are you going to charge yours? Tonight we're not whores. Tonight we're princesses. EXOTIC AFRICAN BRAIDS You must teach us how to walk like you. Maybe then we'll get more work. There are ways... But you have to start when you're young. Was it scary on the raft? You don't have to use sign language, Caren. And people come from America by plane. I flew into Holland. From there I came down here. Rosa, you can help her out. With her papers. You have contacts. Rosa has screwed ministers. And gone to parties and seen all kinds of things. Why don't you call someone? It's not the way things are done. And it's a load of bull. Tell us one name. Just one name that we can believe. I can't. Because you're lying. I can't. I signed a contract. Really? A non-disclosure form. They made you sign? And they always frisk me before, just in case. He's that important? One day I'll bring it and you'll be sorry. The phantom menace. She's said it so many times. Know what their problem is? They haven't traveled like us. What do you expect? Where are you from? The Dominican Republic. Boca Chica. I'll see what I can do. While you're at it, can you check my business license too? Somebody wants you, Zule. Can you take over? I'll give it a try. She's all right. You don't come from Santo Domingo on a raft, Caren. It's in America. I know. I got nervous. What's that? It belongs to my friends. Are you here alone? I'm with you. You like it? Very much. It's sancocho. We cook it for our boyfriends as a sign of commitment. I'm kidding. Why do you work in the van? It's not work. I'm a volunteer. I'm still a student. Then why do you do it? I like it. I like you girls. Well, some more than others. A volunteer... How lucky. Just when I needed one. Turned out tasty. We have to leave at 8, volunteer. I can't explain. Gently. Gently, papa, please. What's wrong? It's difficult for me. Vallejo, Zulema? Yes? When they come out, you can go in. I went for some tests. What kind? Everything. How's Manuel? The same. Sometimes I get carried away. We're taking a little time off. And your volunteer? Just as bad. Did you know that the sea here is very important? There's no sea here. Exactly. That's why everyone thinks so much about it. Things are not important because they exist... ...but because people think about them. Like your son. He's not here but you think about him every day, don't you? That's why he exists. Because you think about him. That's what my mother says. We exist because someone thinks about us, not vice versa. She says someone said it... ...but I think she made it up. She makes everything up, when it's convenient. Actually, I... I don't believe in God much... ...and I'm not religious or anything. My mother is... ...but I'm not. The only thing is... I've been thinking, you know... And I think that... Well, the worst thing isn't... ...wouldn't be if there was nothing after death. The worst thing would be if there was another life. Another life like this one. Zulema Vallejo. Go through. The doctor will be with you shortly. Where are my results? They'll bring them now. Make sure she looks great. She has to knock them off their feet when they see her. Are you glad about leaving? I'd like to leave too. And open an eating house. Yeah, a cock-eating house. Hey, I'd be great at it. And Mamen would come with me. Wouldn't you, Mamen? What's this? I can't believe it. It's too much! What a bitch! Unbelievable! Incredible! How fancy! I knew it! How cool! Well, I never! How fancy! Where did that car come from? It's for me while I'm waiting, to take me shopping. Cool! Want to go for a ride? There's no room for me. This is great! The ladies are my friends, Joaquin. Did she screw him here, Joaquin? Some oil tycoon gave the Princess of Monaco a car like this. I heard it on the radio. Put down the windows so they can see us. Where to, madam? Let's go to the park so the girls can see us. Neli, go to the park. You'll flip. I'm with Joaquin... ...a friend of mine. Go to Alameda and we'll pick you up. Mom, look out the window. Secret documents! Wow! Angela, put that down. It's top secret. We won't wrinkle them. Caren, stop it. "Confidential"! Put it down. Joaquin, who is Rosa seeing and won't tell us about? I have to be with my son. After that, I don't know. I might come back someday. It's normal. That's your kingdom, Zule. Princesses can't live away from their kingdoms. They're so sensitive they die of nostalgia. I told you once, remember? It happens to me sometimes. I miss things that haven't happened yet. It's yours. So I'm giving it to you. It's for your operation. It scares me. Besides, Manuel's right. I'm weird. I'd probably self-reject. And if you self-reject, the sooner the better, right? Remember me, okay? We exist because someone thinks about us, not vice versa. Never forget that. Of course, baby. We'll see each other really soon. Really soon. I'm bringing you a present. A present. I can't tell you. It's a surprise. Don't wait around, okay? Okay. Maybe today's the day. The day of the detour, remember? The one you said we have to be ready for. Maybe it's today. My friend. She's leaving because she wants to. Excuse me? She's leaving. No one's kicking her out. She wants to be with her son. Great. That's all. If life gives you... ...more than five reasons to go on. If life gives you... ...more than five corners to sleep in. If life gives you... ...more than five million to die... ...you strain yourself. Night and day. The check, Jose. How are you? Great. I met a boy, you know? We're seeing each other. Good for you. Where did you find him? At the methadone clinic. He's great. He holds my hand and everything. And calls me "sweetheart. " The first day I almost slugged him, but now... I'm used to it. You know what I'm sorry about? That I didn't meet him before... ...when I was whole. Because I was really hot. Really hot. Anyway. He missed it. Well... That's his fault. He should've showed up sooner. Cool. The jerk. He should've showed up sooner. I'll tell him that. Here. By the way... ...the bathroom looks great. Cool. About fucking time, Jose. It's been broken for over a year. Maybe I'll buy one too. No one calls the other phone. That's not because of the phone. Who knows? Being so expensive... ...more people might call. And they can call when I'm out. But you never go out. It would get me out. To test it, see if anyone calls. Can you hear well with this one? They all sound the same. You haven't had any flowers lately. He must be on vacation. How's Zulema? What? Zulema. How is she? She left. To her country? This morning. On vacation? She couldn't take it anymore. She couldn't. She was a whore... ...and she couldn't take it anymore. And she had some guy after her. Some asshole who had it in for her. So she left. She wanted to be with her family. How did you meet her? Once I took her to the hospital. The guy had beat her up. Until today. Until today. I don't want any more. Caye! Caye, your phone! Caye! You answer it, Mom! They call me Caye, walking the street. The mischevious, the oh-so-lost. They call me street. Street by night, street by day. They call me street, today so tired, today so empty.
