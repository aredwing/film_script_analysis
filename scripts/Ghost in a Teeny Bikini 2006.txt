Well, actually, it is! Someone you know? - My rich cousin, Sajlus Davenport. One without children. Is that a good thing... or bad? They invited me to go to'' raven'' This weekend's reading of the will. Not think so, and we still have 2 days shooting for the film. Can not. Well, can not we a couple of days rest and the movie ends next week? Absolutely not! That would set me back about ... $ 250! Who's gonna pay for that? I can not afford that! You would not you? Uncle's estate is worth over $ 3 million! That would cover the costs, delayed film, a left over to the new film. If you want? It sounds very, very tempting. But I'll have a bit to think about it. Do you think? Yeah... think hard... ... very hard. Been done, sir. Excellent. So it has received my telegram. I am confident that the immediately supplied. Then we believe that nothing will stop you to a small bird of prey from coming to the reading of the will of a deceased uncle Sajlusa? None Then everything exactly as I planned . Sajlusom testament is that it has to attend in person, reading... Or otherwise, the process inherits including mine, will be null and void. In other words? - In other words, if it appears in a play, I'll be completely off. It is very clever of Mr. Cyrus. Yes, very clever, Yep...

His old friend and lawyer, Aribald Vajzenhajmer? He always hated my side of the family . Even now, he is probably conspired to kill me. Here's my plan to kill Muffin Baker!

Of course Your Uncle Sajlus left specific instructions on how to... and when the property will be divided. One of these conditions is to establish a session , to contact his spirit. Last time. Session? That's just great. I always knew there was a ghost in the house... invisible force... touching... feelings... iljkanje. I really believe in ghosts. In the end, I invited Madame Zola, -known media, to allow the session. So that we can begin, and get the job done on the first try. I understand, you do not believe in the world of spirits Mr. Vajzenhajmer? I've never seen anything that convinces me otherwise , but Sajlusove instructions on this issue are clear. Keep moving.

There was a lot of laughter and debauchery. - Lewdness? Yes, debauchery. Mr. Sajlus at that time had beautiful mistress. She was young, and her name was Tabitha. I like it to wear tight bikinis? Duh? The tight bikini? Now I know why is hard to believe these stories. . Sajlus always said that chest cold is a killer. Because it had a really big... and . Just had them. Is a pity that he died young and had a long life ahead of you. But why? Why would her spirit haunted house? They say they did not have the opportunity to experience the full extent of their femininity. Mr. Sajlus was old even at that time. Now her horny ghost wandering these halls. Seeking a way to fulfill their desires otherworldly. Now that's just netano smashed, sir. If only there was a way to redirect her spirit... You can relieve the suffering of her spirit. But how?

I'm not here to hurt you. Please do not refuse me. I need you. I need it! A has so little time. Please, take me! How big are your shoes! Ispratiu you to the door. I do not know dear, all around session... A little creepy. - Yes, I know what you mean. As the supernatural. Everything is unknown. - Yes. Hey, if you're me you caught under the table? I do not think so. Is that may do unconsciously? Probably not. But I was encouraged to think . About what? - To do a little dive... Ted! How can you think about sex in the house where he died my Uncle Sajlus. You're so insensitive. - No, just the opposite. I feel things all day. A to something else? I can not think of little rolling, when these spirits begins to bang overnight. You'll have to forbear until we get back to Hollywood. Good night, Ted. - Refrain? Refrain? Hey, what's your number tonight, baby? What is this? Well, whatever. What the hell is this... Here, Daddy. Drink this. Do not think I... Give it to me! Better? - Yes. I thank.

Not many people can shoot film in just 5 days. And you have a beautiful girl I'd licked... from one end to the other. And that will just be inherit a fortune. This is all true. So why not continue to sit here tonight all '' bloated''? You just need a little uplifting. Raise? So, you want me to'' elevate'' Or not? I guess your last name is Wood (Wood) for anything? Is not it? Not. Not tonight. Poor Ted. I guess I can give him a little something... But I'm his girlfriend, right? Will not be a pretty sight. But if you do not care about your man, someone else will. Honey, I've been thinking... I think I was a little unfair to you. How could you? How do I? Or does he? Well, I mean... Honey, is not as it seems, this... Did he looks like, but... Do you remember what we talked to have '' triple''? All I did was I started from my end. Want to join us? I hate you! Hate is such a strong word. I'm just a girl. Like any other girl. I just want to love you. I to be loved, than others. Why is this so hard? Why is it so hard to understand? I'm just a fool for you...
