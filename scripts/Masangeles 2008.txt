But just listen. for example... why aren't fish salty when we eat them? - Do you play ludo? - Benito! Go home quickly, fructuoso. There you are, at last! Have you been paid? l'm working! Give me the money. l can't buy anything any more. Later on, Dolores. And the marvellous tales? Where shall l put all the ''Treasures for the Young''dumped in the bedroom? l don't know, any old where... ''Any old where'' is already full up. What are all these posters? There've been bigger ones on the faade for three weeks. And as a present you get ''The miracle of human life''! There is already a mess with my brother's blinking campaign. But at least he has a good salary and a proper job. Don't do that, Santiago! Dolores, see to your children. l can't stand them any more. So you're here, my son? l'm so happy! At San Pedro del Timote, l visited mud huts. Shirley! We can build them with our own hands. for all of you. l've got the plans. felucho, how late you are! Godmother, you're right: God was in a bad mood when he created this country. The people are already in the streets. Mummy, where are chicks which were going to be born. ln the flames of the candles, pet. Concentrate and you'll see them. Can l blow them out? No, let's wait till Daddy's lost the election and joins us. After counting 70% of the votes, it's possible to predict... a big victory for General Gestido in this presidential election. We're waiting for Senator Saavedra, certainly... the future minister for public health. Mummy! Daddy has won the election again! ...a great day for the Colorado Party. lt's a triumph here. People are flocking to celebrate the Colorado Party's victory. l can never thank my wife enough, l hope nothing or nobody will separate me from her, for her presence at diffcult moments during the campaign, and for her sensitivity in face of all the problems. Mummy, he won't be coming. Can we start the cake? She has always been a good counsellor... and has known how to instil in me the force l needed... to get here. lt's certain that without her l should never have been able... The chicks, the chicks... Mummy, come out! The candles are going to go out. Chicks... Mummy, come out! Mummy, let me in! Mummy, open up! Mummy! Mummy! Yes, speaking. But who's on the line? What? Which police station are you calling from? But, damn it, what's wrong? D'you know what l'm doing here? l'm founding a new country! What? What's that? When? And my little girl? How is she? l'll come at once. lnspector, nobody must know. Nobody. Senator... Senator... She was a nurse. Can we proceed? Are we going to Paris? How pretty she is! How old are you? - Seven. - What's your name? Masngeles... Masngeles Saavedra. - What did you say? - Masngeles Saavedra. What's wrong, Daddy? Take a seat, Madam. l'll look after everything. Who are they? Shall we go home? We are at home, darling. Padre flix, please close the window. l'm cold. Aurelio... Have you anything to say? No... The most important things have been said. lf l've understood correctly... Well then! lf it's the will of Our Lord Jesus Christ, what a motherfucker! - So be it. -Amen. ln spite of everything, she's one of us, isn't she? You don't think so? - ls there any yogurt? - Here you are. - '"Masngeles' you said? - Yes. l think it'd be best... for you to live at your Aunt Dolores's. And why me? And we've no more room opposite! - l don't know who it is. - Dolores! - She's just told us her name. - Shut up! At my aunt's? Unfortunately, darling, you have an aunt, 6 cousins who are devilish... and a brother... Santiago. Dolores, come and help me. - Hi. - Hi. 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Are you ok? Yes. Well, no, not really. Do you want to lie down? What's that? My creepy crawlies. Haven't you ever seen any? What do they eat? flies, ants, mantis. They can devour a man in a few seconds. Do you want to hold one? D'you have a tame one? No, l need them to be wild. What are they doing there? They're waiting. - Would you like one? - Do they have babies? What did your Mummy die of? She died of... Well, she wanted to go to Paris. Clot! Get out of here! Out of my sight! l hate you! No! l must get on and cook. Ok then. Panetti, you must start here. Ok, but it will take time. What are you doing here? l'm chatting. Can't you see they've lots to do? l don't want any children here. And these shoes? ltalian shoes made of Uruguayan leather. Like yours. But now, you've shaved both legs. But damn it, who's decided to break my balls? 15 minutes and l haven't smoked one! lt's 3 o'clock in the morning. Why aren't you in bed? l am in bed. But you're not asleep. l can't sleep. How's that? Everybody manages to. Not me. Stroke my nose. Slower. Are you alright here, darling? Why am l living with Aunt Dolores and not with you? lt's very complicated. One day, you'll understand. l can understand now. Aurora and l have a family, we have our own lives, and if changes disrupted it, it would create tension. You smell of alcohol, Daddy. Because of my work. l've been had again by that son of a bitch, Menotti. Who's Menotti? A son of a bitch l should kill. You'd better clean your teeth. Yes. And divorce, change jobs, go abroad, change my life... Maybe tomorrow. Turn off the lights upstairs. There's always one left on. l'm the one who pays all the bills here. So l can turn on all the lights l want. All! Aurora! What's happening to the doors? Why are you doing this to me? l'm having the whole house renovated. -And that wardrobe there? - lt's not there any more. And my socks? My shirts, my pants? l don't know. Ask Winston. Winston? Did l tell you that General Romagno had called? To say Dr Menotti had taken up the duel. lt'll be a duel with pistols, early tomorrow, at 8 a.m. With the same arms as for the duel which cost Mr Beltrin his life. And the same rules. At 8 a.m. That's a good time. lt's not too early. You fixed the time. Oh, did l? lt's a good time. Do you need anything else? Solitude. The best of company. - Oh, Winston... - Yes, Sir? You should have phoned me sooner. l did. You weren't at Madam Susana's any more, and hadn't yet arrived at Madam Estela's. l thought you were at Madam Sofia's, but nobody answered. lt's because l forgot to tell you about Nuria, a magnificent Negress. - Shall l turn on the radio? - Yes, thank you. ...without ever having learnt to fence, Senator Saavedra will fight his 4 th duel. Don Aurelio, if you're listening in, l beg you to be careful. We've always followed you, since your 1 st duel. What would become of us without you? We've always followed you, since your 1 st duel. What would become of us without you? Panetti, where've you been? l've been waiting for hours! D'you see this room, Panetti? l'm very fond of it. And l'd like the top part, up there, to be arched. D'you see? That's a bit complicated, we could see about that later. Aurelio! Who's in there? Aurelio, is it you? Give me a hand, Panetti! - Santiago, what are you doing? - l'm doing bigs. With your pants on? Nobody's perfect. What a son of a bitch Menotti is! He's killed him. He's covered in blood! Help him. He's bleeding. He's bleeding. There. On the right. No, on the left. No, it'll be better upstairs, in the bedroom. No, we haven't time. ln the dining-room, on the table. Quiet, please. Talk to me, Aurelio. Please bring me some surgical spirit and some tweezers. And call the priest. To hell with the priest! l want to finish the duel. father, have you come to give the Minister the extreme unction? The Deputy Minister, it seems he's been hit by a bullet. Can you confirm that? No. The Minister's in perfect health. l'll be careful. Don't move. You'll see, it won't be long. Gently... Does it hurt? Yes. Keep still. There. lt's over. - Panetti. - Yes? l've always wanted a door here. Here? Are you sure? lt's a question of intimacy. Give me the cartridge! The cartridge! Much ado about nothing, as usual. lf it was serious, we'd know. You shouldn't walk round here. lt's very dangerous. What's that for? The wind carries the prayers to God. What's the prayer on this one? lt's too complicated for a woman. These are Buddhist flags. But you go to father felix's church. So as to conspire! Careful, it's very precious. Winston, look what l've bought. Where's Mother? Madam is in her room with Mr. Aurelio. There were wonderful things at the Hotel Carrasco's auction. - fine glassware, everything. - What's that? We can put it in the scullery. But you're mad! This piece merits... a better place. - Excuse me, your Excellency. - Yes. l'm coming. What is it, Benito? - Have you any children? - Yes. Do you know ''The Miracle of Human Life''"? lt explains procreation. Benito, stop all this with your books. We're at a turning point. Talk to Aurelio. He'll find you a job. Oh, we haven't anybody at the head of the UTE. - The telephone? - Yes. l don't know anything about it. l can't imagine talking into a wire. That doesn't matter, l don't know anything about electricity and l'm the Minister for Energy. Those who work there are the ones who know. As for us, we manage. We must master the modus operandi. Create new ones, imagine the modus operandi for the future. Get it? Stop that, or l'll kill you. Hasn't he woken up yet? Aurelio! Wake up. lt's a wonderful day. Your speech about wool was a sensation. They all came. You were on the front page of the papers. But l lost the duel. What a son of a bitch Menotti is! That's not important. You've won the hearts of all the voters. At the next election you'll stand for the presidency, won't you? - Not even drunk. - What d'you mean? lt's a life of servitude. The president is the first to get up, the last to go to bed. - Vice-president, then. - What's the use of being Vice-president? Like that, you'll only be at a gun-shot from the presidency. Stop your crap. Look who's asleep at your feet. How are things, Larrea? At 4 p.m, the girls must be fetched from school. Then they go to a birthday party. At 5 p.m, fructuoso has to be fetched from his chess lesson. Are you going to the UTE like that? You look like a tramp. Button up your jacket. Turn round. And take off your hat. Go on. No, put it on again. You're going to be late for work. On your way back, get some buns! - But have you put in the door or not? - Yes, Madam. l like the other door better. That one? You can change it tomorrow. And what shall we do with this one? Don't stress me. l can't think of all the doors. l had to pay for this door. We'll talk about that, later. l can't put my finger on what worries me here. lt's this pillar. How come l didn't notice before? lt's the best thing about this house. lt's a horror, Panetti. lt's true, when you look at it, it is a bit ugly. Shall we knock it down? - You're not an engineer? - Yes. Well, all but. But if one takes into account the contrary forces, gravity, then... But according to you, can we demolish it or not? l don't dare do it, Madam. Was l wrong in taking you on? lt's not that. We'll demolish it, but... But nobody wants to work in this country. We don't have unemployed, but lazy louts. And l warn you: we're going to renovate this house, and make it larger, too. Good night, darling. Everything ok? More or less. Why did you marry Aurora? She's perfect. No, Daddy, she's not perfect. Well, ok. She's not perfect. You've got masses of women round you. Why her? What's that, ''masses of women''? Who told you that? Did you love Mummy? She was an exceptional woman. You'd promised to take her to Paris. Did you love her or didn't you? And you? Did you love her? l don't remember. What d'you mean? l remember her perfume, her hair, her necklace. But her face has faded. She was glorious. Almost as much as you are. Who are these people? father felix! Who are these goddamned long-haired yobs? These young people work for the church. They carry on the work undertaken years ago by a man... A man who... every day, went and looked after the sick, every day, went and looked after the sick, the most destitute. l mean Don Anibal Saavedra. 30 years after his too early passing away... Esteban, tell us... How many houses have we built at Paso Carrasco? Three. Our problem is the lack of help. Yes, there are already 157 young girls pregnant, living in great deprivation. ln the name of the father of this project, Anibal Saavedra, we suggest that everybody voice their opinion now... about this distressing reality. But tell me, felucho, is this a mass for my deceased husband or an AGM? is this a mass for my deceased husband or an AGM? Benito! Benito! How do you manage to play so well? l play that one too. Yes, l know. But not as well as you. lt comes with practice. No. No, your talent is not due to that. lt's your spirit. No, it's not that. Don't say that! You're glorious! l have neither body nor soul. l must be a ghost! Are you mad, or what? Damn it, who taught you to play that? My Mummy. Can you play anything else? This, for instance. Well l'm damned, by the Holy Virgin! Pinch me, l'm dreaming! Well l'm damned, by the Holy Virgin! Pinch me, l'm dreaming! - Your mother taught you that? - Yes, she had long fine fingers. A direct access to my room. That'd be perfect here. - Or rather there, Panetti? - No. - Or rather there, Panetti? - No. The balcony railing is far too near. What are you reading? That's not for girls of your age! l don't see why. lt's a french book. Aurora, leave that child alone. Mrs. Aurora, l must pay them. l've got no money. l've got no money. lt's pay day. lf l don't pay them, they'll kill me. l'll have problems with the union. But we haven't any more money. Stop it. l'm the poor one here. The work must go on... We must make the most of the good weather, the winter will be very cold. And why don't you make the most of the good weather to go to the racecourse, lay bets and with luck you'll be able to pay us. lay bets and with luck you'll be able to pay us. You know God's watching us all the time! There you are... trying to lead me astray, but God's watching us! The workman behind me is watching us and he's ready to kill me if l don't pay him. The Council of Ministers has decreed the honours of a Head of State... The Council of Ministers has decreed the honours of a Head of State... for the burial of our dear President of the Republic. for the burial of our dear President of the Republic. l wonder what the army thinks. They want us to decree a state of emergency. The Left and the Communists are rising. And there are tupamaros everywhere! l don't like the look of things. - l don't know what will happen. - That's the point, Aurelio. lt's an opportunity for you to save our country. We need a strong leader. Stop, Mummy. Daddy, what's a state of emergency? lt means the army can come into people's homes at any time, under the pretext of national security, even here. Panetti resigned. lf we don't pay him he's going to stop the renovation. Panetti resigned. lf we don't pay him he's going to stop the renovation. The President of the Republic is dead! So what? l've no money. l'm a civil servant, not a multinational. The Uruguayan State is poor. Haven't you finished your renovation yet? You don't understand what's important in life. That's just the problem with this country. That's good. Be a bit more energetic, fructuoso. -Are you sure it's over there? - Yes, Madam. But that's not Montevideo. But that's not Montevideo. Yes it is. Panetti! Panetti! Mrs. Aurora! What a surprise! Come in, come in! Give that to me, l'll help you. Come in! What a surprise your visit is. - May l introduce my wife? - Good morning. - May l introduce my wife? - Good morning. Would you like a matecito? No, thank you. - l've brought you something. - Don't tell me it's what l was wating for. What is it? A mixer. Madam, we have no electricity. You've no electricity? lnstalling it is far too expensive for us. Come here. Come here. Come. This is for you. Do you like it? - Yes, it's beautiful. -And as it's cold in winter. You're barefoot! She hasn't any more shoes and we haven't the money to buy any. Start working for me again. When you like, but have you settled the money problem? What's that? What, Madam? That. Nothing. lt's only a Communist Party flyer. The militants who came have good ideas. They're lads from here. They're decent people. They're lads from here. They're decent people. But are you going to vote communist, Panetti? Yes, and my wife too. They think a lot about the workers. But don't you understand anything? l do my best. You know what it'll be like if they get into power? D'you know what communism is? Under a communist regime you can't own anything. Nothing. They take everything. They take... They take everything you've got, Panetti. You'll even have to share your wife. And loyalty, Panetti? What about that? Wait. Winston, the number of the dossier again. The government must act. You don't know what poverty they live in. There's a minister who deals with that. There's a minister who deals with that. lt's not enough. As for me, l'm going to act: they can live here. Madam, we're not in an orphanage. lt's not the same thing, cooking for 10 as it is for 20. Ok. You have to decide. Either we pay Panetti, or l'll go and get them to live here. Are you there, Aurora? We've just received the news. We've just received the news. As regards the robbery committed at the State Pawnbroker's by the guerillas, the National Liberation Movement of the tupamaros declares... that it will give the workers back the booty taken away in error. The communication runs: ''We don't want to rob the workers, but rather those who exploit and rob the workers.'" but rather those who exploit and rob the workers.'" They won't give it back! lf they say they're going to give it back they'll do it. They only want rich people's jewellery. There's a man to whom they've returned his dead parents' wedding rings. l'd not give anything back, l'd keep the lot. They'll start killing people. They'll start killing people. They're nothing less than criminals. No. They want to save the world like Robin Hood. l'm not afraid of them. They won't attack the family of the future president. Give your sister a share, lgnacio. They can't come in here. Of course they can... Of course they can... they can come in through this door, now. Do as you're told, and everything will be alright. The same for you, too, little girl. Please put down your guns. Search the house! There are 8 children here. There are 8 children here. Put your guns down, please. Ok. We'll put our guns down. They were in the kitchen. Let them go, Miguel. Quiet, please. Nobody else in the house? -Answer! - Put your gun down! Well? Panetti has finished work and my husband is at the TVcentre. Do you take us for tupamaros? No, we're the ones who are the tupamaros. from the National Liberation Movement? Yes. You've heard about us? Of course! Aurelio is on TV. As new minister of lndustry and Commerce, As new minister of lndustry and Commerce, l'm considering the creation of a tax on financial activities. financial activity must be... at the service of national industry. Because industry creates employment. And it's with jobs that we can combat injustice. We must put an end to it... - Good intentions. - You see. - Good intentions. - You see. But he'll not manage to get his ideas voted in. The only solution is a mobilisation of the masses, a revolution. You must understand: there's no democracy without sharing. No sharing, no democracy. But does he think he'll manage it by democratic means? - ls there another way? - We only believe in armed struggle. - ls there another way? - We only believe in armed struggle. Me too. Santiago! - What's the matter with him? - Leave quickly. He's going to die. Good. Get going, quick! Paint in the stars. Hurry up! Paint in the stars. Hurry up! Come on, hurry up! Come on. Get a move on! - Paint in the stars! - Shall l paint a star on the wall? Can't you see that this wall has just been repainted? See for yourself! Not on this door. lt's new. Where do you want us to paint it, then? Where do you want us to paint it, then? l've an idea! 7 years later 7 years later May He have mercy on you. May He have mercy on you. May God help you repent of your sins. May He bring you peace and relieve you of your illness. The body of Christ. Amen. That's it, flix. Thank you. l'm very tired. l need to be left alone. Bye, Mother. Bye, Son. No! Don't go! - Shall l tap up your cushion, Gran? - Yes. Help me a little. So much is happening in this house. There're some weird people here you know. Keep away from them. Terrible things are happening in this country. Don't stay with those fools. Get away from here as soon as you can. Go anywhere. To Paris... We don't have a lot of time left. Go to the altar. And look under the pale blue altar cloth, on the right. You'll find something. Have you got it? - Your real grandfather's letters. - What? Keep them carefully. lt's a secret. Aurelio isn't Anibal's son. But you must still love him because he's a good man. Anibal was a fool. They smell nice. - What use are they? They're in french. - Keep them. ln this madhouse, only you can be trusted with them. That's all l have left. Do you have anything to tell me? Come on... l think l'm ill. Strange things are happening to me. They're all ill in this house. Except you, darling. Don't worry. lt's natural. lt'll pester you a little, but only for 40 years. That's it, you're a woman. l've lived long enough to see you become a woman. Charity, mercy and compassion. Those are God's commandments. Don't talk to me of charity. l know we're fighting the same battle. Yes, it's true. Poverty, problems, diffculties. A lot of people have been arrested. That's always been the case, Santiago. At night, l hear the police vans. And the shouts. They are all tortured, some disappear. Whole families... await news from them for months... Sometimes in vain. l can only offer them spiritual and emotional help. The peace only God can bring. - You hear the police vans, too. - What do you know about it? l have my sources. Do you think l ignore your struggle? What if you were trying to trap me? You've known me for 1 9 years. Why have you come? What do you want? Your phone line. l loved my mother so much! Do you want to sit down? What a pain this menopause is! But at least, l won't have any more kids. At last. Does it hurt? lt always hurts. Everything hurts. l don't know what men see in it. They breathe, they pant, they scream... They sweat, they stink... Let me give you a piece of advice: Don't resist. Don't even try. lt makes it worse. The quicker we give in, the sooner it's over. CX4N to CX7J, l can hardly hear you. What's the matter? The aerial is 56 metres above sea levell CX7J to CX4N. Conditions are bad! Over! CX4N to CX7J. The sailing boats are ready. Over. CX7J to CX4N. Cancel it all. The weather forecast is bad. Over. CX4N to CX7J. What do you mean, bad weather? What is it? Radio Tirana. Where's that? ln Albania. And there's also Radio Cairo. - ls it here? - Yes, it's here. Why communicate with the whole world? To make contact. lf l stop talking, it means something's happened to me. - Shall l show you? - Yes. Well, for instance, Equatorial Guinea. Wait... CQ Guinea 3C16, here is Uruguay CX7J. Over. What's that? How should l know? Remove it. lsn't the phone simpler? No, you can't rely on it. And on top of that, this is the future. A global means of communication. ln 2008, every household will have one next to the fridge. They look like ants. Exactly. They are born together, they live together, they die together. They work for nothing. Benito! This country is too small for you. No! No! Out of respect for God, tell... Dolores and the kids it's over. She is your wife, and l christened your 6 children! Yes, 3 wonderful children, and 3 others... All this is a mistake! l'm not sure... l'll think about it. Come back tomorrow. l can't. - On Wednesday. - lt's Winston's day off. - So what? - father, open your eyes! - Winston... - Yes, and? Haven't you got it yet? What sort of world do you live in? Benito... You have said it yourself from this pulpit: l can admit anything, as long as it's human. Yes. lt was on a bad day. lt's your duty to tell them. But who'll believe such a thing? You're convincing. Nobody can resist you. Show some guts for once, and phone them! l need a phone line. All right. And 197 metres wiring. 1 97 metres wiring? Why? lt's a big church. One must walk a lot. But God listens everywhere. Yes. But l'm not God. Enough! lt's a disaster, Mr. Aurelio! And yet, l feel much more confident. lf you carry on like this, you'll be ready for this duel... in 5 years time! Unfortunately, it's in 5 days. Santiago, how do l look? Pathetic. Everything you do seems ridiculous to me. You must understand: it's a question of honour. - lt's a man's business. - Women's business, more like it! What's this one called? Mimi?- fifi?- Bijou? Santiago, don't listen to the gossips. You talk of honour? When your whole party is corrupt! What? Will you also talk to me of a revolution? lt can't be worse than now. Even Che told me that it was useless in this country. You want a revolution? You'll have one! followed by a military regime! And one which will last. They are the worst because they are all frustrated! All they do is prune the trees! You only talk of power. You couldn't care less about the people's problems. The people don't want chaos, they want trustworthy leaders. Look, this is what's important! Houses for those who have none. This is concrete! You just send money to the Yankees. What did they mean, your speeches about productivity, wool, ltalian shoes? - Demagogue! - Don't talk to me about wool! You've never set eyes on a sheep, you little brat!
