I-- You're--you're Bill, right? Yeah. Yeah. Did you just start working here or-- I haven't seen you around. I've been here eight years. That's--wow.

Yeah, why? I don't know. You just seem a little out of it. No, no, I'm just... tired a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Long week and... Well, I'm gonna get going. Oh, whoa, hey. We just got here. I haven't seen you in four years. Come on. Come on. Have one more. All right. You know, what's been going on? How's--how's work? Work's--work's good. Kind of a funny thing. I ran into a guy we went to school with. Bill, you remember Bill? A sort of a quiet guy, kept to himself, Bill. We picked on him all the time. Yeah? Yeah. Well, get this. He's a janitor at the place I work. He's a night janitor. You serious? Yeah, and he's exactly the same guy. He hasn't changed at all since high school. He kind of mumbles to himself, stares at the ground. That's funny. That's funny. Yeah. Wow, Bill. Hey, hey, hey. How's Karen, by the way? Karen, yeah, she's-- Yeah, she's Karen. She's... Um... Yeah. Hey, whatever happened? What do you mean? You know, we--we used to see each other every weekend almost. Come to the house, Sitting in the back, hanging out. Will and his friends would be there, And we'd be barbecuing. Remember? Hey, this weekend, You come to my house, we get some steaks and we fire up that old barbecue. It'll be like old times. All right. You want another one? Sure. Yeah, have one. We'll do one more. Hello. Is Dave there? No, I think you've got the wrong number. Oh, I'm sorry. Thanks. Hello. Is Dave there? No, you've got the wrong number. Oh, is this-- Hello. Dave? Yeah? Finally. Hey, it's me. How are you? It's funny. I just kept dialing the wrong number. Somebody else kept answering.

Well, did-- you sound weird. I do? Yeah, it doesn't sound like you. Think you have the wrong number. So is Todd spending the night tonight? Mom, he's bringing over his video game system. And there's this one game I really want to play. I... Uh, hey, guys. Whoa. Thanks. Uh, I--I... I really appreciate this, guys. I don't know what's wrong with my legs. They don't seem to be working today. Usually they're pretty dependable. I don't have an idea why this is happening, but every now and then, something like this does happen, I guess. I don't know, I can't or something. I remember once I was in the third-- # When I need someone who cares, # # I find you're always there # # every time I pine for you. # # When my castle turns to sand, # # you're there to hold my hand. # # much more than only friend. # # Much more than lovers. # # There will be a lucky star # # shining above us. # # Time and time again, # # I will hold you close to me. # # So close we will be, # # like one for always and always # # and time and time again. # Hey. How was your day? Fine. Something wrong? Why? Oh, I don't know. You just seem-- I don't know-- Everything is perfectly fine. Anybody can do whatever they want to do around here, right? Well, there's no one else here, Karen. Well, that's right. I mean, and you don't-- You don't-- I don't what? What? What? I'm not doing this. No, come on, what? I don't what? I'm keeping my mouth shut. You just-- You just do whatever it is you want to do. Why don't you just go ahead, walk out of the room like you always do, Like you normally do, just walk right out of here. Everything is my fault. It is an insult to the cook To put too much barbecue sauce on your food. The psychology behind it is, the food isn't good enough on its own, so you've got to cover it with a whole bunch of mess to get a good flavor but not this. I did not know that. Looks like you're cooking up a storm. Hey. I would've had one on here for you If I knew you were there. Maybe next time. You bet. Take care. She likes you. She's very friendly. Well, she was friendly to you, not to me. Well, it's 'cause I know her. Is she married? I don't think so. Well, you should ask her out. Well, I don't know about that. Have you been on a date in the last four years? Uh...Not really. So the last time I remember you going on a date then would be before... before the accident. Started driving again or... I don't have a car. Mom? Do you have a phone? What? I need to call my mom. No, sorry. Do you know if they have one downstairs? Sorry. Hey, Erik. Hi, Mr. Curtis. Is something wrong? I can't get inside. Locked yourself out? You're locked out? Here, maybe I can do it. Come here, show you a little trick. I do this myself a couple of times when I lock myself out. Yeah. Take a credit card, slip it in, wiggle it around... there you go. Thanks, Mr. Curtis. No problem. Tell your mom and dad I said hi. Okay. Tell your mom and dad I said hi. Tell your mom and dad I said hi. So you were licensed in the State of Delaware, right? So how can the government say it was wrong for you to practice architecture? I initiated business before I had the physical license document. I passed the test, but apparently that doesn't matter. And you can get fined for that? You can go to jail for that. This is pretty serious, okay, you know? I mean, I-- and if I don't go to jail, I'll probably lose my job, and I don't think the company's gonna protect me, so... Sounds like a kafka novel. That's crazy. Hey there, Bill. How's everything going? Hey, you work here all night or... Yeah. Yeah, every day, huh? Yeah, just Sunday to Friday. Man, I don't know-- I don't know how you do it. I mean, I--I don't think I could do that, Stay up all night and everything. You get used to it. Yeah? Yeah, I guess it's just like, you know, anything else, huh? Now, what does that do for, you know, like-- you know, with your wife-- I mean-- you know, it seems like everybody just-- Bill, you all right? Bill. I just have to-- are you-- something wr-- did I s-- Um... Okay. Could you... Hey, listen, if I said something to upset you or something, I just, you know... Oh, I'm gonna get this. Have a good weekend, all right? Yes, yes. Why are you always nagging me? You come home. You nag, you nag, you nag. I'm not nagging. Do you know how hard I work, and I've got to put up with this? What kind of father are you? Look at you. # When I go, # # a sky of blue, a pale breeze, # # as if god knew permanence # # has graced this thought. # # A silent prayer, # # an open wound, a melody. # # That I renew with who I am # # and who I was then. # # I am true... # # as I am born in you. # I hate you! # and you are all alone. # Sadie, shut up! # and you are more than now. # # In love again with the girl. # # A smile, I'll feign. # Are you okay? You say something? Are you okay? Your eye looks bruised. No, I'm fine. I heard you guys fighting before. Oh, that's nothing. I'm sorry if we're being too loud. No. No, it's fine. Yeah, because you're so quiet, and I hardly ever see you coming or going. I didn't even know you exist. Thank you. Well, it was nice meeting you. Thank you. # To a man going up suddenly # # whose life is touched # # by a ray of happiness. # # Can you guess? # # There's no way out but to climb halfway in. # # The other half is left to rot in the sun. # # I am true, # # as I am born in you. # # And you are all alone. # # And we are more than now. # # Yes, we are more than now. # # We are more than now. # The average person sleeps for 20 years over the course of a lifetime. Six of those years are spent dreaming. The scientific term for being aware that you are dreaming is lucid dreaming. Once you become lucid, it is possible to actively control your dreams. Some people can naturally do this. For others, it must be learned. Small windows of time exist during the ritual of sleep when it is possible to begin lucid dreaming. But it can become a door to another world where you have complete control, a world where your wildest fantasies can come true. Karen? Karen? Hello. Hey. I didn't know you were gonna be here. Well, somebody has to get groceries. No, I know, but I didn't know where you'd gone. You didn't leave a note or... Can I look at what you got, because we probably shouldn't be buying the same thing? Well, why don't you just eat what you get and I'll eat what I get? How about that? What, are you just gonna follow me around the store all night? Yeah, I used to do it all the time when we first started dating. What? Yeah, I used to-- wherever we'd go, I'd walk behind you. You never noticed? No. Why would you do that? Well, I liked how every single guy would be, you know, looking at you, every one that would go by, and, you know, you were mine. Don't do that. Oh, well, well, well. Oh, yeah. Embarrassing me. Are you married? I used to count-- I used to count Each one that used to go by. One. There's goes one. There goes another one. Don't do that. What? Do what? Look around. Would you look around? You see anybody looking at me? Do you? Do you see anybody looking at me? Yeah, I know you used to do that, and I know when you stopped doing it too and everybody else stopped doing it. come on, come on. That's when you stopped. Leave me alone. In order to lucid dream, you must first remember your dreams. It is necessary to start a journal, keeping a daily log of your dreams. You will start to recognize patterns and reoccurring characteristics. When dreaming, these characteristics can be used to help tell yourself that you are, in fact, dreaming. This will facilitate lucidity. Oh. Yeah, it's-- It's the same material as my cleaning gloves. Can I buy a hotdog here too? Building's falling down. Ah. I forgot my clothes. That's right, folks. You will get everything, I mean absolutely everything, for $19.99. If you call right now, we'll throw in our bonus gift. We've got copper condiment shakers. Holy cow, it's a $50 value.

Just anything. Just something that will, you know-- I use these. Take a couple of these before you go to sleep. You're out like a coma patient. Mm-hmm, you use these, huh? Yeah, from time to time. They're good, because you don't get that sluggishness in the mornings. That's the problem with some of them. Sure, sure. You fall asleep, and then you can't wake up. Yeah. Yeah, where are those? You know, the... Um... Let's go find those. I'm not sure if my supervise--I-- Oh, just-- I can show them to you. Okay. I don't know if that-- Let's get some of those puppies.

Yeah, I remember when I was a kid I was helping my mom bring groceries to the car. And it was summer, and I remember the smell of the hot asphalt. I guess the tar of the shingles reminds me of that. I don't want a st-- are you listening to me? I don't want a store credit. I want a refund. Sir, I don't know what else we can do for you. Okay, is your manager here? Can I talk to him or her?

I'm Officer Porter. If I can have moment of your time, I'd like to ask you a couple questions. About what? If I can get you to come down to the station, then-- Is this about my neighbors? I heard them fighting before. Is she okay? I'd just like to talk. We've had some complaints from some of your neighbors. Complaints from my neighbors, what do you mean? We just need to clear up a few things. Is she okay? Did she tell you I talked to her? Well, first things first, What did you do this afternoon? I was sleeping this afternoon. Most of the time, I was sleeping. Why? You sleep during the day? I work at night. I'm a janitor. What did my neighbors say? I'm not get into specifics here. My neighbors made complaints about-- Okay, sir, look, I don't know anything about you, but your record's clean. What are you tal-- So if we can just keep it that way. My record? What are you talking about? Look, don't bother the other tenants. I don't bother them. Don't harass anyone, and don't threaten anyone. I don't-- Wait, did she think I was gonna hurt her or something? Who? The woman who lives next door to me. You threatened a couple of children. That's why you're here. What are you talking about? They said you attacked them in the hallway and you chased after them with a bat. They broke into my apartment. A couple of ten-year-olds... Yeah. Broke into your apartment. Yes, they did. Did you leave the door unlocked? No, I--no. Then how'd they get inside? I don't know. I just brought you down here to talk, okay? I'm not saying one thing or another. Raped her, her husband. Her husband raped her. Sir, if I can get you to keep yourself out of trouble, you'll save us both some time. I heard--he beats her. They live next door to me. I heard--I heard him beat her. I heard her scream. I heard he raped her. Sir, are you listening to me? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to go into your room and look through your stuff. I'll never do it again. It was wrong, and I'm sorry. Can I go now? Go to your room. Can I play nintendo? No. No nintendo for a month. But, Mom. Go now. I don't even know what to say. I'm so sorry. If I were you, I would've slammed the door in my face already, but-- Well, I brought you this. Oh, it's just-- I don't know, I listen to it. You've probably heard me playing the tape during the day. Thank you. And I would like to invite you over for dinner tomorrow night. I can't. I work at night. Okay, well, this weekend, too, maybe, if you're around, We'd love to have you over. I don't know. I don't think so, but I don't know. Okay, well, it's an open invitation. And, again, I'm very sorry, But it was nice seeing you again. Hey. What? You all right? Yeah. Why, why, why? What do you want?

You wake up And then you go to work and then you come home. And you just try really hard not to disturb anyone. It's like you don't exist, you know? It's really kind of-- it's really kind of sad. What would you like me to do? I can't change what happened. It was seven years ago, and it wasn't your fault. She ran a light. She went out in the intersection. You know, but you-- You just choose to carry around this guilt for something that you didn't even cause. Is that what you think? Is that--you think I'm afraid? Oh, no, no, I think you're a shining example of someone who's dealt with their problems. Hey, you know why I sleep all the time? Uh, so that I don't have to deal with Karen or work or anything, really, any of this. And... So I don't need-- I don't need you to come in here and lecture me. Okay? Just go. Leave me alone, okay? Sheryl, you're needed in women's wear. Sheryl, can you report to women's wear? She'd like that, I think. That's for her-- You like that better than the one-- Better for her.

Where are we going? To pick up your son. He gets home today for winter break, remember? Okay. What's wrong? You tell me. I don't know. Then why are you staying at work Till 10:00 at night every night? Okay, um, I-I-I-- Is anything ever gonna change? I mean, some things are different, but it's really all the same. All right, listen to me. I'm not mad, okay? I'm not mad. You'll just go sleep on the couch. Because I just don't want to do this anymore... Not if it's gonna be the same thing day in and day out. Listen, Karen, I avoid things, you know? I mean, I avoid-- I--I avoid things, you know? You know, when I think that-- I feel like You're upset about something, you know, I-- I--you know, I-- I'm not gonna pretend I know things when I don't, just not gonna do that for the sake of-- I--look, I know things are gonna be different. Things are gonna be different, very different, okay? Nothing's gonna change. And if I'm gonna be alone, I want to live alone. Wait, what--what do you mean? I mean, I think it would be better if we live apart. I really do. So--so--so that's just it? I mean--I mean... I think we should go in. Wow, there he is. Oh, hey, let me-- let me get these for you.

You're not gonna sign it? No, thanks. Burnham and Taylor, this is Karen. Hey, it's me. Gary? Hey, listen, can you just tell me what's going on? She didn't want to sign it. Why not? Look, Gary, I'm at work. I can't talk about this here. I'm hanging up. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no, it's taken care of. Don't worry about it. Burnham and Taylor, this is Karen. Look, all I was saying was that I think that we nee-- Look, Gary, I'm in the middle of my lunch break, And I don't really feel like spending it talking to you about this, so I'm hanging up. Hi, this is Karen. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks. Karen, all right, listen to me. I screwed up, okay? And there are some things that, you know, I regret. I-I think I've taken for granted, you know, that you would be there when I got home. I think that I took for granted all the times that you would act happy, you know, and try to get me out of-- When I was in a bad mood or something. And I took adv-- I took for granted that you would offer to spend your life with me. And I think I prevented you, you know, from, you know, doing certain things-- Career, 'cause I know how important it is to you. But, you know, you gave it up so you could be--you could be at home with our son. And, you know, I know that prevented you from getting to where you wanted to be with work but you never once single comp-- You know, one time complained about it. You know, you just quietly accepted it, because you were willing to compromise for me. And I took it all for granted. And now I see you becoming this whole new person without me, and that's the thing that's just killing me, you know, because I want to be there, you know? I want to be there by your side. And I know that I have this kind of like-- put on this, like, macho bravado, and I never talk about, you know, my feelings and stuff like that, but nothing makes sense anymore. Nothing makes sense without you, because, I mean, look-- You know, I know that I am--I'm-- I don't think I'm anything more or less than I see in your eyes. And I--I'm sorry. I--you know, I wasn't there for you, and, you know, I'm sorry I went on all these different times about personal stuff at work and--you know, I'm sorry about that, you know. And, you know--and I know it's selfish of me to, you know, Say that I don't want to see you leave me, but that's just it. I mean, I want to know about your day, Karen. I want to know about, you know, everything that's going with you. I want to wake up with you next to me. I want to know about every last little minute detail of your life, because I am interested in it. I know that this one single phone call is not gonna-- you know, it's not gonna, you know, fix everything. I understand that and everything, but if you could just understand that I am gonna listen to you from now on. I'm gonna listen to you about everything. And I'm gonna change, things are gonna be different, and, you know, you don't have to call me back. I know how busy--I mean, you can call me back if you want, but we can also talk about this stuff, You know, at home and everything. But, you know, I just wanted to-- Okay, so I love you and, you know-- I hope you have a good day. Um, all right, bye. You have one new message. First message. Karen, all right, listen to me. I screwed-- Message deleted. Yeah. I'm sorry. What time is it? Um, about 10:30. Oh. I'm sorry. No, no, it's okay. Um, this-- it was in the garbage. Yeah, I'm throwing it out. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's-- it's my house. It's nice. Why do you act like such a freak, Bill? I guess...Just... I don't know how to be around people. Well, I don't know, you know, 'cause it seems like with you, it's all just a show. Yeah, you know, I don't think this is who you really are. The way you act with me and other people and stuff, I think you just put on this facade when you go out in public, but, yeah, you know, I mean, how are you gonna expect people to get to know you if you don't let them in? You know? But, um... Eh, what do I know? Well... Yeah. You--good night. Night. Want to keep it? No, you can have it, if you'd like. Thanks. Hey, hey! Listen to me. Look at me. Why aren't you looking at me? What? What do you want? What? Why aren't you looking at me? Look at me. Hello. You're lying to me. No, I'm not. Look at me. Tell me. Hello.

Multivariable calculus? Yeah, you're taking that again, huh? No, why would i take it again? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Larger and larger tracks and ports were clear-cut to bring new land under the cultivation. But without the trees, The island's topsoil soon eroded under torrential tropical rains. Aware of the impending disaster, competition for the island's limited resources led to tensions between clans. Every moai represents a whole family. The reason the moai looks towards the land is to protect the people spiritually. Whenever you have conflicts-- Anything going on? What? You know, like, with your friends. What are you guys fighting about? and then they shifted from ancestral worship to-- What do you mean? even as the last few trees were being cut down, bigger and bigger Moai were being constructed. I'm not an idiot, okay? I know you guys are mad about something... or at least Mom is. No, no, come on, we're not-- We're not fighting about anything. Everything's fine, really. Yeah, hey, come on. The lack of all basic materials Fostered centuries of open conflict between the clans. As part of the... I'm going over to Rob's. What? You're going out? Do you want me to leave the TV on? Uh, yeah, sure. By the 1800s and 1700s, The population of easter island had plummeted from 16,000 to less than 5,000 due to warfare. # Whisper words I long to hear, # # a simple hello. # # Tell me all I need from you. # # Whisper so I'll know. # # Love is strange, # # but stranger still is how I need you so. # # Whisper dreams-- # on August 16, 1960, Joe Kittinger did something no man had done before. As a part of a U.S. Air Force sponsored experiment, he rode a helium balloon up 102,800 feet into the air. The atmosphere became thinner and thinner outside his protective suit, and the sky turned black as he rode up to the end of the earth's atmosphere. He stepped up onto the edge of the carriage in which he was riding. He looked out on the earth so far below him, and then he jumped. # Scissors cut the faithless wish # # from heart-spent sorrow. # # Kissing out this one last scene # # to kill off tomorrow. # # When I die, I'm dying cool. # # I'm leaving with some gold. # # So whisper dreams I'll dream with you. # # Whisper so I'll know. # # Write another chapter, # # lose another soul. # # Whisper so I'll know. # # Whisper so I'll know. # # Whisper so I'll know. # # I know it's true. # # Whisper, "I ain't lonely." # # Oh, whisper, "I ain't lonely." # # Whisper, "I ain't lonely." # All right, you, give me the money. The money. Come on, hurry up. Come on, give me the money. Come on. Hurry up! Get on the ground. Get on the ground. All right, give me your wallet. What? Your wallet, give it to me. What, are you deaf? No. Then hand it over. No. Hi. I'm picking up Gary's stuff. Do you remember me? Yeah. I'm sorry. For what? For the way I was, picking on you and making fun of you and... I'm sorry I acted like that. Yeah. A few things I could have done differently. It was a long time ago. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay... Good to see you-- seeing you, you know? Can I ask you something? What's he like? I mean, like... What kind of person was he before he got married? Like, back in high school when you knew him, 'cause, um... Uh... I can't imagine him, you know, like, without my mom. He didn't judge people. And he was, um-- he was--he was smart. Smart, real smart, but he didn't, you know, show off about it. He was just a really pleasant person to be around. He was a good friend too. It's been our top seller ever since a consumer reports article ranked it as one of the safest on the roads. I just bought one for my own daughter. You have a daughter? Yeah, just turned 17. I figure if they're gonna be on the roads, they might as well be in something safe, you know? I see all these parents buying their kids sports cars and whatnot and I'm thinking, "you know, you're just encouraging them to drive fast." But you, you got yourself a great car here. If I bought one for my own daughter, you know it's reliable. Thank you for putting it all together. Any problems, any concerns, you just give me a call. You have my number. Enjoy. Okay. Hello. Gosh. You scared me. I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone was here. Sorry. I start next week in the mail room, but they said I could go ahead and get familiar with the place, you know, start learning the names of everyone who works here. I hate spending the holidays alone, so I figure this would take my mind off it. Do you think I could move in more stuff over the weekend? No, it's locked. But I could let you in. Really? That would be great. How do I get ahold of you? I'm Patty. Bill. # To a man going up suddenly # # whose life is touched # # by a ray of happiness. # # Can you guess? # # There's no way out but to climb halfway in. # I'm Bill. # The other half is left to rot in the sun. # # I am true... # Bill. # as I am born in you. # # And you are all alone. # # Yes, we are more than now. # # We are more than now. # # We are more than now. # Hello. # A sky of blue follows you. # # A sky of blue follows me. # # A sky of blue follows you. # # A sky of blue follows me. # LeapinLar
