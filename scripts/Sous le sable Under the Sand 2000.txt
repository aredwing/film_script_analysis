Want to go to the beach tomorrow? If the weather's nice. Which beach? Where the Germans go? Yes, that's a good one. Not too crowded. Where'd you find it? It's an old bottle from last year. How is it? - It's drinkable. - Not great! We're finally on vacation. Are you tired? Yes. That feels good. Coming for a swim? Not just yet. I want to rest a little. Excuse me, have you seen my husband? He's in his sixties, fairly tall? No. We just got here. Are you sure? He's got gray hair, blue swimming trunks... He went swimming and I've lost sight of him. Sorry, we haven't seen him. Thank you. Excuse me... My husband's disappeared, I can't find him. Excuse me, I've got a problem. My husband is lost. Calm down. Did he go swimming? - I think so. - You think so or you're sure? - I'm sure. - He didn't go for a walk? I'm telling you he went in the water! - On this beach? - No, further down. That's out of our sector. I know, but please hurry, something has to be done! It was here. He went swimming here. Did anyone see him? No. Can't you see it's practically deserted? We'll alert the police and get a helicopter. Did he have any personal or professional reasons for disappearing? No. Or for suicide? Did he seem depressed or weary, or mention a desire to end it? No! Very well. For the investigation, we're going to need a very precise physical description of the missing person, your husband. Just in case you don't hear from him in the next few days. We'll also need medical information. Whether he's had any surgery, or fractured bones. Jean... Jean? Is anyone there? It's about lung capacity, I'm not an old fossil yet! No, you're just in the process of fossilizing. You should go to the gym with Marie. Yes, come with me. It'll do you good. And jump around in loud tights with a bunch of ladies? Can you picture me, Vincent? Not really, no. You've got the wrong idea about gyms. There's no need to wear tights. You'd look cute in nice pair of shorts. You don't have to take a class. There's always the weight room. I should go, I really need to build my muscles. Where do you go? A little gym a few stops from my place, most mornings before work. My husband always says he's coming, then backs out. He's like you, Grard, not a big athlete. But he promised me he'd try to come on Saturday mornings. If you came with us, Grard, you wouldn't be alone. You'd both be more comfortable. With all the work you both have, it's good to have a physical outlet. Have you always been athletic? When I was young, in England, I was a competition swimmer. Then I met my husband, a real Frenchman who loves good meals and fine wine. More salad, Marie? Sure. It's delicious. I wish I had your cooking talent. But you have other talents, don't you? Thanks, but don't bother. I've got it. Let me help. Would you call me a taxi? - Do you like him? - Why do you ask me that? No reason. I think you made a big impression on him. Been married long? Over 25 years. That's a fair bit of time, isn't it? Yes. - Do you have children? - No. You didn't want kids? You're too nosy. I know, but I'd like to know you better. Do you have time for a nightcap? No, I've got class tomorrow, and... Another time. Not asleep yet? I was waiting up for you. Did you have a good time? It was nice. Grard was funny. Did you eat? No. Would you like me to fix you something? No, don't bother. I'm not hungry. Good. That way you'll lose a little weight. Goodnight, honey. - Did you set the alarm? - Yes. Jean? Yes? Hold me tight. I don't want to go to work this morning. - Did you sleep poorly? - No. What's the matter? Nothing. I feel like taking the day off. I want to stay here with you. I'm sorry. We'll end class 10 minutes early. - I'm going for a coffee. - See you. Hello, Madame. Do you remember me? Last summer, in the Landes... No. I was working there, we helped you, you know, for your husband? You've got the wrong person. I've never been there. Are you trying to sell me on him? Not at all. I've got to go. - Call me, as soon as possible. - I promise. It looks great on you. - Isn't it a bit conservative? - No, it's in style. It shows off your figure. - I'll take it. - Great. The two shirts, too. Do you have this in blue? - Which one? - That one. It's for my husband. His eyes are blue. There. Your code, please. I'm sorry, your card's been refused. - How can that be? - I don't know. I've got my checkbook. - Do you have ID? - My passport. I'll pass on the shirts and tie. Very well. I'm sorry, I'll keep the tie. Hello Marie? It's Vincent. Amanda gave me your number. I just wanted to apologize... I mean, for kissing you. I'd like to ask you to dinner. Maybe if you're free tonight... I'd like to see you, if you have time. I know a nice little Chinese restaurant. I don't want you to feel obligated... I'm getting flustered, just give me a call. My number is: 0144253658. Kisses. I mean, excuse me, scratch the kisses... Sorry. Call soon. Who is this Vincent? You're already home. I bought you a present. Do you like it? It's very nice. How do I look? Pretty. So, who is he? A friend of Amanda and Grard's. - What's he look like? - I don't know, average. Handsome? Sure, not bad. But not my type. Why not? Too mannered. Did he kiss you? Yes. But I pushed him away. Why? I had just spoken about you. You want to have dinner with him? I don't know. To tell you the truth, I didn't think you'd call me back. Why not? I don't know. I was afraid you were mad at me. Really? It was flattering. When I started teaching, I had lots of big plans. Specialized research projects on exciting subjects. But with time, I let them all go. Little by little. Any regrets? No. My relationship with Jean has always been my priority. But I love teaching. Right now we're working on "The Waves" by Virginia Woolf. I loved that book as a teenager. It's a wonderful book. The students like it. Actually, I don't really remember it. That's... The suicide note she left to her loved ones. Terrifying. She drowned herself with rocks in her pockets. I think it's a beautiful death. I'm not surprised. The English are fascinated by things morbid. Are you cold? No, it's nice out. Thank you. I had a lovely evening. Me too. Come up for a drink? No, thank you. I start early tomorrow. Good night. Good night, Vincent. LAW OFFICES - Listen Marie. We need to talk. - I'm listening. Your banker informs me you are way overdrawn, and can't access Jean's account. - He said that? - Yes. You need a power of attorney. As long as he is still missing, his account will remain frozen. In such cases, it is necessary to wait 10 years before a will can be... Don't worry about it. I'll speak to him. Speak to who? To Jean. Who else? Just because he travels and works a lot... Marie, be reasonable. I'm only asking you to be careful, don't spend too much. Try to live on less as long as things... I appreciate your concern, but don't worry. I will handle everything. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. I wanted to see you. Are you free? Well, yes. I just finished a class. May I take you out? - Where? - Wherever you like. Your place? Really? You don't want to have lunch? No, I'm not hungry. Thanks. - What is it? - I'm sorry. You must know why you're laughing? I don't know. It's weird... What's weird? I'm sorry, it's just... you're so light. Light? That's a new one. It's not a bad thing. I'm just not used to it. Can we close the curtains? Close your eyes. Caress my hips... My breasts. Are you with anyone? Not really. Meaning? I see a woman from time to time. But we're not together. Are you afraid of commitment? No. I'm just not in love with her. And you? What about me? Have you had other lovers? No. I've never cheated on Jean. This is the first time. Why now? I don't know. You don't make love anymore? We do. Can I ask you a question? Go ahead. If we were married, would you cheat on me? No, certainly not. I've got to go. Already? Yes, I'm in a hurry. Just pull the door closed when you leave. Hurry, you're already late. I'm glad you came over. Never has a summer's end seemed so magnificent This season's vines will make only the finest grapes In the trees we can see swallows are gathering But we must leave each other even though we loved each other What a lovely time for saying goodbye What a lovely night It feels like we're twenty again Rising with the smoke of a cigarette Love trails away My heart stops This is a message for Mrs. Drillon, from police headquarters in Lit et Mix. We found a body in the sea that fits the description of your husband's. Please call us back urgently at 0540342115. Thank you. Jean? Are you home? Are you home? Hello? I was asleep. Listen, I don't know. I need to think. I'll call you back, Vincent. Goodbye. Please come in. This way. Let me show you the main rooms. This is a living and dining room. It's spacious and has lots of light. It needs paint, but the walls are in excellent condition. The floors are perfect, too. They have a mosaic motif. Excuse me, I'll be right with you. Don't you feel well? I'm alright. Just a bit tired. You should see a doctor. I know. Do you like the apartment? Yes, it's lovely. Just what I'm looking for. Pretty good, for a first visit! It's perfect. When can I sign? Soon, but don't you want your husband to see it? It's not necessary. He'll like it. What's the matter? I'm sorry... I don't think it's going to work. Really? Why not? Can't you see? Very good. Are you under stress these days? No, I'm alright. Sometimes I think I hear noises when there aren't any. - What kind of noises? - I don't know... Everyday sounds, kind of a humming or buzzing. - Are your eardrums sensitive? - Not particularly. Let's have a look. - Goodbye, Mrs. Drillon. - Thank you. That'll be 180 francs. Maybe you could also settle your husband's bill? What bill? He didn't have any money on him last time. It's been a long time since we've seen him. Can you tell me when he came last? Yes, of course. Mr. Drillon was last here on... Here it is. June 26. Just before our vacation. - How much do I owe you? - Two visits makes 360 francs. Excuse me, Madame? Hello, Madame. My husband is away on business and asked me to fill his prescription. This prescription has expired. I know, but he's in Africa... And as these are hard to find there, he asked me... I can't do it without a proper prescription. Please, this is an exceptional case. I'm sorry. You should get a new prescription from his doctor. - Can I just ask you one thing? - Yes? Do you have a pharmaceuticals list? Do you think Jean is unhappy with me? Marie, stop. You've done nothing wrong. Do you hear me? Yes. Let's order some wine. The wine list, please. Hello? Yes, it's Marie. Am I disturbing you? Sorry about last time. Yes, I'm fine. There we are. Are you hungry? A little, yes. I didn't have time for lunch. Tell me, where is your accent from? A village in the Southwest. Do you know the Landes? A little. Jean has a family house there. Where, exactly? Near Lit et Mix. Don't know it. What are you reading? Just a book I found by the bed. Good night. Good night. Did you set the alarm? What alarm? It's just me. Everything's fine. - Why are you looking at me like that? - I don't know. I wake up alone and then find you here. I'm worried. Was I snoring? No. I just felt like sleeping here. Was this your husband's office? It is my husband's office. What are you going to do with it now? Why "now"? I don't understand. I've known about your husband for a while. I was waiting for you to tell me. I know it's hard. You don't know anything. - I can help you, Marie. - Help me? Who the hell are you, to me? Nobody! So please, mind your own business. - More coffee? - No, thanks. I thought... you'd want to talk. Really? No. I don't talk much in the morning. I'm not a morning person. Strange that you saw me that way. I'm going to shower and get dressed. Close the door when you leave. - Look, that's enough. - Let me go! Tell me what you want, what I mean to you. You'll have to get over him sometime. You want the truth? You don't measure up. How are you doing? Not too bad. You haven't come for a while. True. Yes, I know. I need to talk to you. - About what? - About Jean. Good news? Just the opposite. What is it now? I think Jean may have killed himself. My son, suicide? There are no suicides in the Drillon family. I just wanted to tell you Jean was depressed. - He was taking medication... - I knew that. How did you know? I'm his mother. And I'm his wife. But you didn't realize he was suffering. It's hard for me to believe that Jean confided in you. Well, you're wrong. You underestimate our relationship. Give me a break! If you know something, tell me. I can't stand it anymore. I don't think for one second that Jean killed himself. Or even drowned. The truth is more cruel. He disappeared, quite simply because he was bored. Or more accurately, bored with you. He wanted a new life. To start over. That's understandable, isn't it? Many men dream of doing it. Anyway, you weren't able to give him a family. I got a call from the morgue. They found a body in a fisherman's net. It seems it might be Jean. Jean always loved fishing. You belong in an insane asylum, not a rest home. You'll be in one before I am. Fine... Alright. Thank you, see you later. Excuse me, Madame... Hello. I'm here to see Officer Caron. - Your name? - Mrs. Drillon. The last room to the left. Thank you. What you are about to hear is very difficult. You can stop us at any time. No, I want to know everything. According to my autopsy the day after we recovered the body, it seems your husband drowned by simple submersion, a drowning where the lungs fill with water, undoubtedly caused by a strong undertow, and the resulting muscle fatigue as he tried to fight it. As you can imagine, we were unable to identify the body from the photos you gave us. The body was submerged for too long. It is in a state of advanced putrefaction. Meaning? Putrefaction causes the skin to turn greenish, and the body and head of the cadaver to swell. The process accelerates when the body is exposed to air after having been submerged in water, as in this case. Morphological identification is thus impossible. The test confirms a genetic link between the body and your mother-in-law, Suzanne Drillon. As for the odontological tests, it appears that the x-rays we've taken match up with the dental records provided by his dentist. However, because your husband has never had any fractured bones, we can't draw any conclusions from the state of the skeleton. We also have the material evidence you described: The blue trunks and the watch. They are in good condition and should be easy to identify. We'll show them to you. No. What's wrong? You don't want to see them? I do. But I want to see the body first. As I already explained to you, we can't really call it a body at this point. The cadaver is partially mutilated, and seeing such a sight could be extremely traumatic for you. I'm perfectly capable of handling it. Are you sure? It's very important for me. Shall I just show you part of the body? No, I want to see all of it. May I close it? These are the trunks. Do you recognize them? I think they were blue, like these. And the watch? Is something wrong? Not at all! This isn't his watch. What do you mean? It perfectly fits the description you gave us. But this isn't it. I should know, I bought it for him. Please, take a closer look. I'm sure it isn't this one. It's not Jean. You just identified his trunks. I'm his wife, and I'm telling you it isn't him. Adaptation: Sionann O'Neill
