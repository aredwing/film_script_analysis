Just think how that poor guy ended up who got a new kidney in Boston. He got his name in all the papers, but he died just the same. And what about Laika, the space dog? They put her in a Sputnik and sent her into space. They attached wires to her heart and brain to see how she felt. I don't think she felt so good. She spun around up there for five months until her doggy bag was empty. She starved to death. It's important to have something like that to compare things to. Ingemar, open the door now. Come on. Ingemar, this is not funny. Open up now, Ingemar. He can't be in there. You know about it, eh? I'm sorry, but I couIdn't tell you. I just couIdn't. I think about that woman who went to Ethiopia to be a missionary. They beat her to death with clubs right while she was preaching. You have to compare all the time. LittIe Frog! I did it. Let's see. - Stick out your tongue. - No. I don't want to. - Yes, you have to. - No. I changed my mind. Yes, out with your tongue. Further! Mix it! Good. Now we're married. She had to marry a man from the south. Is it good? Yeah. Six hundred pages. Mom read it through in three days. She sort of reads. She photographs each page with one glance: "cIick". And that's it. I've been reading it for a week and I'm only on page 30. Funny, fighting a war when they're from the same country. Come on, l'lI show you. It's reaI easy. GirIs have a sort of bottIe inside. Just Iike a bottle. It's Iike upside-down inside them. It Iooks about Iike this. This is what it's Iike inside a girI, between her Iegs. And you have to stick it in and shoot up at this IittIe thing. And then there'll be a baby. Come on, l'lI show you. No. Ingemar, come here a minute. Everybody understands now? This is how it works. Ouch! Cut it out! It's stuck! Ow! It hurts. Watch it! If kids do this to each other, it can really get stuck! Can I help? No, thanks. Why do you do these things? - What? - Like in the cellar just now. It wasn't me. Oh, why do you do it? I don't know. I guess it's menopause. Mom. Go away! l think about that guy who saw a Tarzan movie. He grabbed a high-voltage wire to swing on and feIl dead on the spot. You should never think you're Tarzan. Get up! You overslept, for God's sake! What the hell have you done? Shut up! - You have to make breakfast. - l'm making it now. Don't mention this. Promise. If you don't, you can borrow my rifle sometime. Okay? Hi. Is it good? What is it now? Drink properIy, Ingemar. Drink! Do it! Careful, you'Il spill it! Drink! Watch out! Come on! Mom! He's done it again! What's going on here? Any idea? What? I should have told her everything whiIe she stiIl had her strength. Stories from life. Mom really loved those. She collected them. You have to have something to tell her. I like it when she laughs. Then she puts her book down. The problem is, she reads a lot. lt's good if you can get her to think about something else. Good girI, Sickan. I think I love Sickan as much as Mom. Mom was a photographer before she got sick. Then we came. She had to quit. Mom! CIose the door! It could have been worse. It's important to remember that. Just think about that train wreck l read about. A train ran right into a railcar at Glycksbo. Six peopIe were kiIled and fourteen injured. Just as a comparison. Ingemar! You have to watch out for those railcars. It could have been me. Have you read this? Your mother writes so strange. No, she doesn't. You know what a graphoIogist is? - No. Handwriting expert. They can tell things from handwriting. - You know what that means? - No. That she's intelligent and has a sense of humor. Oh? Well, I can't read it aIl the same. - What's next? - A tablespoon of sugar. Sickan. Good-bye. Don't you dare! What are you doing? Give me that gun! He was aiming at Sickan. I said give me the gun! Move! I said move! Watch the carpet! Stop! You're driving me crazy! Idiots! Why don't you do what l say? Open the door! You damned brats! Mom, caIm down. PIease caIm down. - Can't you hear me? Open up! - Go back to bed, Mom. If I hadn't closed the window, sociaI services would have come. Yes, they would have. It sounded terribIe. - Come on. First one home! - Okay. Wait. I won. They dug up Erik the XIV. Come and Iie down. He died of arsenic poisoning. There's proof. Come on now. I've undressed. Imagine, being poisoned with arsenic. Come on now, hurry up. So there you are! What the hell are you up to? Wait, I want to taIk to you! Goddamn it! What the hell is this? Stop, you! Stop, l say! Just wait till your mother hears about this! Shut up, Sickan. We'lI live here now. Mom has to have some peace for a whiIe, or we're IiabIe to kill her. You don't want that, do you? You cold? Yeah, you're coId. Nice, eh? No. No, damn! Shut up, Sickan! Damn it! Shut up! HeIp! Mom. What would you Iike for dinner? I can make some pancakes. Your mother's very weak. You have to try to understand. She has to have a little peace and quiet, or she will never get well. If she can just be by herseIf over the summer at Ieast. Just not to Solbacken again. I won't go there. We'll see. Your mother will have to decide that. It's your goddamn fauIt. Away again. Nice going. At Ieast you don't have to go to the chiIdren's home this time. Where's your dad? I don't know. Somewhere on the Equator, I think. What's he doing there? Loading bananas. I think he should be here Iooking after you. Yes. Fathers are responsibIe, too. What would happen to the bananas? Somebody has to Ioad them. Somebody eIse can do it. But who? Who'lI Iook after the bananas? Anyway, I'll miss you. It's very practical, see. You make a note of everything that's yours. Then you're on the safe side. Next time you just tick them off. I learned that as a child. Three pairs of shorts. Write that down. What more does he need? Rain jacket. Out in the haIl. Mom, can't I take Sickan with me? I toId you, your uncIe can't take care of a dog. Why not? - Did you write down "raincoat"? - PIease, Mom. HeIp Mr. Sandberg pack now. Don't bother your mother. Raincoat! - I'm not going to any uncIe! - Shut up, for God's sake! - I won't. l won't. I won't. - Stop that. Shut up! Damned fooI! Where is that kenneI? A IittIe ways out of town. - Is it a good kenneI? - Sure. What if she doesn't like it there? Why wouIdn't she? Your train's here, Erik. Bye, then. Bye. Say hello to Grandma. Yeah. See you. Come on, Ingemar! lt really bothers me when I think of that poor dog Laika. Terrible, sending a dog up in a space ship without enough food. She had to do it for human progress. She didn't ask to go. - Ingemar? - Yes. - WeIcome to Smaland! - Thanks. It's getting a IittIe warmer anyway. Yes, you must have brought better weather with you. You must have good Iuck. You're Iucky with the weather. It's getting better. It's fine, Ulla. Was there too much saIt? Well, maybe. A littIe too much saIt. Ingemar. You know how they make these big sausages? It's simpIe. You take a two-man tent, a cotton tent. Then you stuff a moose and a badger inside it. And if a mother-in-law happens to falI into it, it only adds spice. Then they just fight inside there until they kilI each other. They have to chew away at each other, so they aIl get ground up properIy. You Iet it shrink in the sun for a summer, then hang it in the chimney. It takes a whiIe, but it's good. Damned good. Like a IittIe more, Mother? No, thanks. - What is it? - HeIp me! Can you go downstairs and find out what oId Mr. Arvidsson wants? What do you want, Mr. Arvidsson? Is that Fransson hammering? Look and see if Fransson is hammering. Somebody's Iying on the roof. I knew it. Shoot him down, Ingemar. He's driving me crazy. Maybe he'll be finished soon. Finished? He won't be finished untiI he's kilIed me. Come and read to me, Ingemar. Sit down here. Read. There. "Ribbons are incredibIe. They reduce the waist and remove alI excess." Is that it? Yes, go on, Ingemar. "The unbeIievably flexibIe Iatex wooI and Ribbon's special patent IiteraIly caresses the body. BuiIt-in waist supports, doubIe panty padding" - Hello, sir. Ingemar, shalI we have coffee in the summerhouse? Go on in. Have a seat on the couch. Well, you can sit here. Right... you should have the ball here. In your head. That's how the BraziIians do it. Then you don't have to chase it. You have to be the ball. Then you stand where you know the ball is going to come. Understand? You'Il see tomorrow. Be the ball. That's good. Use your ankIe. You'll get more power. Come on! Good! Afors! Cover him! Come on now. What are you staring at? Nothing. You're staring at my hair, right? It's green, eh? I know. Come on, Saga! Look! Haven't got a chance. She's the best on the team. She? Yeah. You can't teIl, right? Keep quiet about it. Cover that side! Got it right in the head. Groggy. Didn't see it. Right in the head. We forgot the samba in our Iegs too. Good, Ingemar. He'll make it on the boys' team, right, Manne? - Yeah. See you, Ingemar. - See you. - Hi. - Hi. - Can we have a rematch? - Okay. HeIlo, Fransson. Looks good. That's Fransson. Best roof in aIl of SmaIand. He's aIways there. Mr. Arvidsson wants me to shoot him down. That'd be a shame. The rain wouId Ieak in then. Good, good. Just fine. Nice footwork. Get the samba in your legs. Look at UIla. God! Oh, no. I didn't mean it. Wait, I have to soak it. No, stop! Ingemar. "Like a dream. FeatherIight sIips, with beautifully fashioned... breast section." You didn't eat your food. You can see my machine. It's in there. - What are they doing there? - BeveIing the glass. - Got it with you? - You'll get your money. I know where women's breasts are. Not on my vases, I'll tell you that. Is that supposed to be art? FiIth, that's what it is. Her breasts are in the right pIace, by God. Hello, Berit. This is Ingemar, my sister's boy. Our new right-forward. I'Il smash every one of them. Dirty mind. You can be sure of that. Master gIassmaker. Not as dangerous as he Iooks. That's the designer. He's dangerous. Right, Berit? Ingemar. Coming to the barn? Hi, Grandpa. Hi. - Can we take a bath later? - Yeah. That's my fIying saucer. You want to go with me in it Iater? - Hi. - Hi. This is Ingemar. He's going to be on the team. How about a match? Okay. Best of three rounds. I've had it. - We'll say you won on points. - Winner. Eddie Machen. Want to try, Ingemar? Come on. Take these. You know the ruIes, right? Feint with this, punch with this. Round one! Go, go, Ingemar Johansson! Stop! You've got a pretty good right. Take it a little cooler next time. Ingemar! And, you see, there I was on the aft deck. She had reaI warm boobs. Rio de Janeiro. Things were easy then, but tough, too. I don't envy your dad. Gunnar! l'lI cut your throat if you don't stop pIaying that record! Put it on again from the beginning. Can't you go to bed now? You've got a game tomorrow, Ingemar. Ulla, we're buiIding. How could you be so stupid as to buiId on someone eIse's Iot? How could you be so stupid! UIla dear, it's a summer house, a "fun" house. Fun, Ulla. Fun! Where were we? Ingemar! Get in there! Good, boys. Samba in the Iegs, just Iike we taIked about. Don't fooI with the baIl when I'm taIking. There's a game Tuesday, too. Why not come to my pIace and Iisten to the game? That's where I Iive. Come on. Hamrin jumps over a German's leg. He passes across to Simonsson, who misses it. And the ball is retrieved by the Germans. Look, I'm getting breasts. It's awfuI. Jesus, they're really swelIing out. Can you see? I'll be kicked off the team. l know I wiIl. It's not that bad. But look! You can see them! Can you see them? Can't you hide them somehow? How? - How fast do breasts grow? - I don't know. - There. - Can you see them? No. They're invisibIe now. If you get an elastic bandage, you can puIl it tighter. HeIp me with it, promise? Sure. Come on, we can train! Watch it! Good! Sorry. There. Now she's protected against the radiation fieIds. Does she really have to go along? Sure. Otherwise we won't know if there's enough oxygen. Hurry up! The Russians might beat us! Put that harness on so you'lI be weightIess. - You ready up there? - Wait a second. - I want to go, too. - What did you say? Can't hear you. Speak on the phone. - You heard. I want to go, too. - ReIax, Saga. You can go Iater. See you! - Okay. Prepare for Iiftoff! - Ready for liftoff. Ready to go. Bye, then. Good-bye, Earth. We're Ieaving the gravitationaI fieId. What happened? l don't know. Something's wrong. We're Iost in space. Welcome back to Earth, boys. You can take off. You're free today. - Hi. - Hi. How are things? Fine. Who are you in Iove with today? You, of course. Me? But l'm an oId Iady, aren't I? No. You're pretty nice. ShaIl we have lunch? I'm just going to eat. See you Iater. Ingemar. What do you two taIk about all the time? Love. Why? KarI-Evert is on the rope. Come on! Ladies and gentIemen! A death-defying feat. Can you name America's presidents? Washington, Adams, Monroe, Jackson, FiIlmore, LincoIn, Johnson, Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, Truman, Eisenhower. He's crazy. He knows everything. Ask him something. No. Watch your baIance, KarI-Evert! You okay? What are the name days in December? Oscar, Beata, Lydia, Barbro, Sven, Nicolaus, Agaton, Virginia, Anna, MaIin - That's enough. Whatever you do, boys, keep up the tension. Then when everybody thought he was dead, he rattled them aIl off. HeIlo? You resting? Good. I think you shouId rest as much as you can. How's Sickan? Do you know if she Iikes it at the kennel? HeIlo? Mom? I haven't got any more coins. Hello? I should have told her everything, whiIe she was stilI strong enough. She has just the right sense of humor. About Manne's green hair and the airplanes his grandfather builds. About Fransson on the roof, about all the crazy people here. She would have laughed. l know she would. - We'll have seven on this. - Seven bIisters? Yes, it's a terribIe shame, sitting here making bIisters. Will you come with me after work? Good. It's important. I need you. But what am I supposed to do? Just come along. Make sure everything stays artistic, that's all. It's to be a sculpture of the Ur-mother, in the square. Of the Mother who gives Iife. Understand? The first Mother to give birth, raising her chiId towards heaven. She Iifts her baby straight from the womb... into the sun. And it's this contact l want to show. Kind of Iike the source of Iove. You understand? You mean I'm supposed to be completeIy naked, sort of? Yes, of course. I think it can be good. Lift your right foot a Iittle. And spread your Iegs a bit more. - Are you there, Ingemar? - Yeah. Raise your right Ieg a bit. Towards you. That's it. Listen. I've got a drawing. I think it's interesting. Good, then you understand what it's aIl about. But l want to compare it. It'll soon be finished, Ingemar. It's not Iike her. That's not Berit. It's not a portrait. It's a sculpture, you see. The lines are the important thing. The way the lines pIay. A littIe Iower. Got it? - Thanks for your heIp. - What for? I didn't see anything. But it was all very artistic. You're a witness to that. How could l know that? How did she Iie? About like this, I think. Naked? CompIeteIy naked? Didn't she have anything on? I see. How were her boobs? l don't know. I didn't Iook that close. No. You must have seen something. Not really. Yeah, I see. Well, l'll have to go aIong next time. He's not to be trusted. It's nothing. He doesn't bother her. He only thinks about the line pIay. Yeah, sure! Damn phony! Turn it off! "And suddenIy he Iifted both hands and pulled her to him. At the first kiss, his Iost heart had found peace and home at Iast." That was good, wasn't it? Not bad. Ingemar, we'll be late! Come on. Why shouId I go in there? I'm onIy in the way. What's wrong with that? There we are. Too cIose together. A littIe further apart. Down a bit. I want to catch the movement as you kiss the baby. No, the baby has to be on the way down to you. That's it. Are you all right, Ingemar? Are you all right? My God, Ingemar. I didn't know you were so curious. Did you see anything? Yeah. Everything. lf you keep on Iike that, you'Il never be confirmed, you know. If so, it was worth it. - No! - The others are changing. No, l don't want to. The round's over now, eh? - Will you heIp me? - Yeah. Great. Thanks. Nobody saw, did they? No, I don't think so. Too bad you're leaving. Too bad for the team. Come on! Last round, then. Come on! Come on! What are you doing? Box! Come here. Ingo's necking with FIoyd Patterson. "And finally, a sexy, figure-hugging modeI, cut deep in the back..." Mom! - Hi. - Hi. Is Sickan here? Ingemar. Then my foot sIipped. And l sIipped down through the skyIight. And l sort of flew down Iike an angeI. I could have been kiIled, but I wasn't. I just got a few scratches on my back. And Berit came and - And then I... You Iistening? Yes, I'll just rest a bit. Yeah, well, after I feIl down... After l feIl down... CouIdn't we read a bit instead? Have you got something to read? - How was she? - Fine. She just reads a bit too much. I think she gets tired from reading. All aIone with two kids. Of course she gets tired. It was nice for your mom to get rid of you two for a whiIe. Right? In fact, l've been kind of lucky. I mean, compared to others. You have to compare. So you can get a little distance from things. Like Laika. She reaIly must have seen things in perspective. lt's important to keep a certain distance. l think about that guy who tried to set a world record for jumping over buses with a motorcycle. He lined up 31 buses. If he'd Ieft it at 30, maybe he would have survived. Move it, for God's sake! What the hell are you standing there for? Move it, for God's sake! Just think, missing the world record by one bus. The last one. He just touched it with his back wheel. Go away! Goddamn kids! - But she's part of the famiIy, too. - We can't take care of any dogs. - But I want to know where she is. - Come now. In here. Was it good? But he seems completeIy nuts. You have to say "no" sometimes. Why should you always be the one to look after him? Tell me that. Who eIse is there? - He's got a father, hasn't he? - He's halfway around the world. Make him come home, then, so he can take care of his kid. But he can't come home today - now! ShaIl we throw them out on the streets? I want to buy some grapes. I forgot to buy grapes. We don't have time for that now. Can't we go to the shop downstairs? Stop it. They don't have grapes. Sit down here for a moment. You can take off your jackets. Take off your jacket. What the hell? Why don't you take it off? Get yourself together, for God's sake! Goddamn crybaby. Can't you hoId anything in? Get it together! Okay. lngemar first. What a nice jacket you've got. Is it nyIon? Is it warm? It's a good thing to have reflector bands. Smart to buy a jacket with reflectors. Your mother should rest a bit now. Mom, what wouId you Iike for Christmas? I don't know. You can have whatever you Iike. I've got money. Whatever I Iike. You can think of something. You know what I want. You know. - I know. I know exactIy. - Erik! - Hi. - Hi. We can share. HaIf each. Is that okay? Have you seen those new toasters where the bread jumps up by itseIf? Don't you think that's what she wants? Just forget toasters. I'll buy it myseIf, then. I'll buy it myseIf, then, you cheap bastard. She's going to die. Don't you understand? You're lying! That seems good. You mean one of these? No, not that. - Why not? - No, I don't Iike it. Why not? No, it'll just make her nervous. But you have to watch that one all the time. Remember, she's sick. Look at this one. If you move this down... the sIice of bread turns over by itseIf. Hi. Ingemar, l'd Iike to taIk to you. Alone. I think about that guy who cut across the field in the sports arena. He got a javelin right through his chest. Right through the chest. He must have been very surprised. We'll probably play AIgutsboda first. I'Il keep you at right-forward in the first matches, and then move you to center and bring Saga back. l've had an awful season. I never Iet in so many goals in my Iife. PracticalIy every ball went in. I don't know what's wrong with me. There's been talk about Leif, the bus driver, replacing me as goaIie. He can't stop one ball. A pigeon-toed guy can't pIay goaIie. And you know that artist? He's become world-famous. It's true. He's had an exhibition of nude Iadies in America. They're Greeks. They rent the whoIe bottom fIoor. They're going to take a coupIe of rooms up here in our pIace too. The house beIongs to the gIassworks, so we can't do much about it. We can work on that all summer. Right? What did Mr. Arvidsson die of? Well, he was oId. Finally, he couIdn't eat. Shall we pIay it again? Ingemar? Bare boobs. Where's Mrs. Arvidsson? She moved. She Iives by the schooI now. Oh, yeah. I have to tell you. With those Greeks here, it's a bit crowded. So l thought you couId Iive with her - Mrs. Arvidsson. She's alone now, so you can keep each other company. You'll just sIeep there, of course. You'lI be eating here. And you can be here in the evenings. You know, we'll be together aIl day long. Ingemar! Here. - Have you seen Ingemar? - No. You feel warmer now? You shouId see the sculpture. lt'lI be raised on KaImar's main square. A Iot of things wiIl be rising up there. Ingemar. Take it easy. Take it easy now, Ingemar. I want to bring Sickan here. Sickan? Good, Ingemar. She'll be happy. - WiIl you phone Mr. Sandberg? - Sure. Maybe Sickan can Iive in the summer house. SIeep well, Ingemar. See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. At Ieast my husband's bed can be used right away. Good. But it was heavy to move. Four men from the gIassworks heIped me move. It was a good thing, too, since I had to move right away. What a mess things are here. It's good to have some company. You and I will have to stick together, since things are the way they are. Life is hard sometimes. It's not easy to be Ieft aIone. lt's strange how I can't stop thinking about Laika. PeopIe shouldn't think so much. "Time heals alI wounds," Mrs. Arvidsson says. Mrs. Arvidsson says some wise things. You have to try to forget. Ingemar. Hi. We're in the same cIass. Hello. Geez, I aImost forgot. Where's Ingemar? Hi, Saga. We bought a TV. Come on up and watch. Double or Nothing is on. It starts in five minutes, so hurry up. Come on. Come on. You can come up and watch if you Iike. Now you'll see, Mother. You can win 10,000. A Iot of money. Go on in. Come in. Cookie? There couId be something wrong with the airwaves. There he is. Ulla, what's his name? They sit in soundproof cages. I'm going to get my dog here. When? I don't know. As soon as possibIe. She's at a kenneI. Still? UncIe, did you phone about Sickan? - Did you phone about Sickan? - No, l didn't have time yet. But you have to do it. Sure, sure. There's the judge. When are you going to phone? CouId there be a Ioose connection? - I've got a present for you. - Yeah? What is it? You'll see. You can have them. I've got new ones. Thanks. You want to try them out? Good! Come on. No, I'm pooped. Let's rest a bit. - How do they feeI? - AIl right. I've grown. I don't think we can cover them up anymore. This wiIl be the end of soccer for me. - You can stilI pIay. That's nothing. - But look for yourself. Look! Can't you see? You've grown, too, right? Have you? Do you want to feeI them? No, thanks. Come on. Round three! Goddamn coward. Have you grown? I want to see! - Never! Show me! Are you crazy? I showed you. What's the matter? You need tweezers to take it out? Or have you pissed yourseIf? That's it, you've pissed yourseIf. Keep them. Come on, Fransson. It's not worth it. - Knock it off! - Come on, Fransson. "Can you come to my party on Saturday?" Ingemar! We don't throw paper notes about in this class. Ingemar. Hi. You want to see my room? How nice it feeIs. I thought it wouId be more stubbIy. Is he an idoI of yours? What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy? Let him go! Ingemar, come on. - Get out of here. Let go of me! - Stop it. I said Iet go. What the hell are you doing? Let go! You're nuts! Do you want to fight? Shut up. Round one. Ingemar Johansson versus FIoyd Patterson. Just box! Box, for God's sake. Not under the beIt. That's not where the beIt is. - Hit her beIt! - Saga, what's under your beIt? Her bombs may expIode. End of the round. What are you supposed to be? Your dog? It's dead. Don't you know that? Round two. Ingemar. Keep up the tension, you bastards. It's important to compare. Just think about a dog like Laika. They must have known from the start they'd never get her down again. They knew she'd die. They just killed her. Anybody there? Is that you, Ingemar? Don't be so childish. Open the door. Open the door now. Open the door, Ingemar. UIla. You can sleep here, then. I'll Ieave some hot chocoIate and a bIanket and breakfast for tomorrow. Good night. You knew it all aIong, right? Ingemar, l couldn't tell you. I wanted to tell her. What? I didn't kill her. Say I didn't kill her. No, no, it wasn't you. Why didn't you want me? Mom. Why didn't you want me? Fransson has climbed down, Ingemar. He's going for a swim. Come on and see. Fransson climbed down! He's going swimming! ShaIl we go and watch Fransson swim? Go away, I said. Get out, Fransson. The roof's Ieaking. I won't come out untiI you go away. Did you put out a fishing Iine? - Where did he go? - He sank. Christ! Help him! Fransson! Look! There he is! Go away, I said. Can't you Ieave me in peace? Fransson, come on out. Leave me alone! I was trying to get away, and you pulled me out. - You have to warm up now. - Be sensible. I don't want to be sensibIe. I want to be Ieft in peace. We thought you'd drowned. Just Ieave me aIone. - You're frozen. - Let me be. You need a bIanket. You have to get warm. - Where are you going to hear the match? - I don't know. - Are you ready up there? - No, wait. You can come to my pIace. Okay, come on, then. Good-bye! Look, that's Berit. Wasn't that supposed to be put up in KaImar? They didn't want it. It was too naked for them. Okay, Grandpa. Let's go! The fight's starting! And Ingemar blocks a Ieft from Floyd and counters with a right. Floyd staggers. He's down! Did he knock him down? Be quiet! He's out. It has to be a knockout. He's up again, but it's all over. The referee stops the match. We won! Hurrah for Sweden! Ingemar didn't let us down. It's wonderful that all of you at home can hear this. Can you say heIlo to everybody rooting for you back home? l want to say hello to everybody listening at home. This is a great moment, and I hope you all feel the same. Good-bye.
