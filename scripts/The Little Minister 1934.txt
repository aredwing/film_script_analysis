Where's the reverence? Aye... we should've chose the lone candidate from aberdeen after all. No, we've got the pick of the lot. I tell you, he prays like one giving orders. Ah, well, we'll see. Thank you. Does my hat make me look taller? Aye, yes. You're almost lanky, dear. Welcome, mr. Dishart. Welcome to the auld licht manse. Thank you, mr. Carfrae. This is my mother. How do you do, mrs. Dishart? How do you do? Come in. Thank you. Move them away, you puddin' - Headed policeman. Will you take a chair? I hope you will be as happy here as I have been. It's like a dream. The first time i entered this room, I decided to cut down that cherry tree Because it kept out the light. But, you see, it outlives me. I grew old while looking for the axe. Yes, jean? There's several folk at the back door, And their respects to you, And would you give them some water out of the well? Some of the pumps is locked On account of the dry weather. Oh. Tell them to help themselves. There's scarcely enough for ourselves. And I should tell you that 3 of them Is no members of the auld licht congregation, And one of them even belongs to the u. P. Church. Let that make no difference. A pailful apiece for auld licht. All other denominations, one cup. Good day, mr. Dishart. Gavin. Gavin, just think. It's all come true. Your own church. Oh, for years i've lived for this day. And the sacrifices you've made. Mother, now you shall have an egg To your breakfast every morning. You're mistress of the auld licht manse. The auld licht manse. Gavin, how many rooms are there? 5? Oh, it'll seem large to you at first, mother, But you'll get used to it. And you shall have a silk dress, With beads on it. Gavin, stop. Not another word to be uttered Till we say a prayer, of thanks on that. Gavin. Do you think I could have a new bonnet With blue trimmings on it? My old one wouldn't go very well With a silk dress. You shall have one with blue feathers On it if you want it. I entreat you, Cherish the goodness that is in your hearts And listen ever to the voice of conscience, For conscience is the safeguard of humanity. Our text this morning keeps before us the fact That all sinners have the scriptural promise Of rebirth and regeneration, And they need never despair, Need never be without the hope Of redemption from that sin in which we were all born. We're all born in sin. But, ah! Come home, father. Go away, micah. Our sins are never too great For god's mercy. But if a man have many sins, or only one sin, Say it is the sin of drunkenness, And remains unrepentant, That sin will utterly consume him, Does any man here desire to be consumed by drunkenness? If you're referring to me, minister, I'd rather consume the drink. Come forward. Come forward, rob dow. You hulking man of sin. Sit here on the stair and attend to me, OrI'll step down from the pulpit And run you out of the house of god. Sit down! And now, my friends, again I remind you, There is no need to despair. Up and forswore. Throw off this vile habit that is dragging you down. It is not too late. There is yet time to stand foursquare with the world And look your fellow man in the eye and cry, "I, too, am a man. " Any man who can bring rob dow to his knees Is a minister to be reckoned with. I think when rob began To interrupt the service, I felt awful sorry for mr. Dishart. But he didn't need any bit of sympathy. Our little minister does not lack courage To stand up to a drunken hulk like rob dow. Aye, tammas. He has the gift. Thrums seems such a quietlike place, Yet they told me in glasgow That i'd received a call from the mouth of hell. Well, those were cruel words. It's true, there was an ugly outbreak About 2 months ago, The manufacturers reduced the price of the web. But what did that mean to a town of weavers? It meant starvation. What did they do, our weavers? They turned on the manufacturers. Made a bonfire of some of their doors. 6 policemen who drove out from tilliedrum Were sent back tied to the seats of their cart. Policemen? And no one has been punished? Not yet, but the sheriff is canny. He'll appear one night with soldiers And seize the ringleaders in their beds, As he did once before. I cannot understand why the widow henderson Doesn't give old sam a headstone. He left enough money, i'm hearing. Mm-Hmm. That's lord rintoul's castle. Oh. Have you ever looked on a lord, Mr. Dishart? No. Or on a lord's young ladyship? No. I have. Have you? Surely you know rintoul is old, And is to be married to a young ladyship. Oh, she's no ladyship yet, But they're to be married soon, So I may say i seen a ladyship. Aye, it's an impressive sight. la, la, la, la-La-La-La... Is that singing? Aye, it is singing, surely, and on the sabbath. It must be one of them egyptians in caddam wood. I'll find out who's desecrating the sabbath day. la, la, la, la, la, la, la-La-Da-Da-De, da-La-La- tra, la, la, la, la la, la, la la, la, la, la- Woman! Don't you know it's unlawful For gypsies to be in these parts? Have you not read the sheriff's proclamation? What? I said, have you not read The sheriff's proclamation? I dinna ken how to read. I'll read it to you. "Warning. All gypsies and other wandering vagrants "Found trespassing on these lands Of glen quharity within the parish of thrums Will be arrested and summarily dealt with. " Woman! ...luck. 15, 2, and 100 nought. 15-2, 15-4, 15-6, 15-8, and 10. Ah, 18. 15-2, 15-4, 15-6, 15-8, and 8. Ah, 16. Cribbage is a game of skill, my dear evalina. Hmph. I wonder where barbara is. Your fiancee has not yet returned from her walk, I believe. Look here, evalina, i suppose you'd try To accept my betrothal With a little better grace. Captain halliwell and the sheriff to see you, my lord. Ah. Lord rintoul. How do you do? This is captain halliwell, And sheriff greer. My sister, the lady evalina. We must teach these weavers That they cannot flout the law Without suffering the consequences. Now, then. Is everything arranged for tonight? Yes, your lordship. We have the names of the ringleaders, And we'll move into thrums after sunset And take them unawares, As we did once before. Yes, but we must be careful. I do not think they intend To be taken again quite so easily. I have reason to believe they've been Making preparations of some kind. Preparations? Ha. To resist my men? I'm afraid so. Ha ha ha. That's good. Rest easy, your lordship. We shall take them completely by surprise. We will have the offenders in the lockup In no time at all. Well, I hope so. Uh, uh, mr. Dishart. Oh, hello, wearyworld. I was just going out for a breath of air. Heard rob dow's compliments, And he says if you're not with him within an hour, He'll break out into the drink again. There's blood in his eye. Oh,I'll go at once. Aye. Hey, you'll let me go a bit wee? Of course. Come along. For until rob sent me on this errand, Not a soul has spoken to me this day. Many a one have I spoken to, But not a man, woman, or bairn had flung me a word. I've often meant to ask you, wearyworld, Why are you so unpopular? Because i'm police. I'm the first that's ever been in thrums. Well, didn't the thrumspeople appoint you? Aye, and they are the very folk that Look down me as a disgraced man for accepting. Even my own wife is short with me When i've got on me uniform. Well, it should be a consolation to you That you're discharging useful duties. But i'm no. Charles dickson says that The very sight of my uniform Rouses his anger so much That it makes him smash windows. Although a peaceable disposed man Until I was appointed. But, uh, they-They do recognize your authority. Ah-Authority? Ach, they won't even come to the lockup After I lay hands on them. Do they say they won't come? Catch them saying anything, They just give me a whap into the gutters. If they'd speak, i wouldn't have complained, For i'm naturally the sociablest main in thrums. That's easy to see. Well, good evening, wearyworld. I- Uh... Well, it was pleasant to crack a word with somebody. I- I'll be in my rounds, now. I- Oh, it's a weary world And nobody bides in it. Micah? My father put me out. He's been talking and arguing with the devil for an hour. Don't be frightened. Rob. Oh, it's a weary world. Oh. Hi, there! Uhh! In the name of the lord, you don't show anything. Ha. Oh, it's just a gypsy, buddy. I'm the police. Oh, I dinna ken. Uh, please, mr. Police. Do not take me to the lockup, andI'll go away. No, no, honey. Stay here and talk with me, And maybe wearyworld won't be hard on you. Sit down. Sit down. Oh, never be a policeman, lassie, Or you'll soon have feet like nobody else's. Aye, but it's grand work. A great responsibility. Ugh. Are you here in case the soldiers come? The soldiers? Those preservists, when they come, I hope i'm a thousand miles away. My heart's with weavers, lassie, But my duty is with the law, And 3 blasts of the weaver's horn Will unleash a bee's nest in thrums, AndI'll have to be in the middle of it. 3 blasts on the horn? Aye, the signal horn they hide in the old mill. Everybody knows about it. Everybody but the minister. He's all for peace, so nobody tells him. You mean the little minister With a twinkle in his eye. I mean the reverend mr. Dishart. Come along, lassie, and walk with me a bit, And maybe you'll give me some of your gab, eh? I- Now, if that doesn't beat all. World. Oh, please, sir. Don't hand me over to the sheriff. I've lost my way. Oh. Perhaps I can help you. Oh, you can, sir, If you can tell me where The old mill is. The old mill? Aye, sir. I want to meet my sweetheart. Oh, I mean, my father were there, And I cannot even find the place. I pass it on my way. I'll direct you. Oh... Oh, you're kind, sir. That's it. I take it you must be the new little minister I hear them talk about. I'm the new minister. Do they say "little minister"? Oh, no. That was my fault. It kind of popped out. But it wasn't meant to be uncomplimentary. You're just the size i like. Ha. Oh, they say bonny things about you. That is, the lassies do. Would you like to hear? I didn't hear you. Did you say you would or you wouldn't? I've said nothing. Oh. Well, I wouldn't want to tell you If you didn't want to hear. They say you're against the weavers Fighting the soldiers when they come. I'm against fighting. Even when they're in the right? Fighting and bloodshed won't help them. Here's the mill. Hello! They're not here, but they left the horn. It's our way of calling each other. They'll be looking for me. Oh! Mmf. Oh. Ha. Um... Give it a blow so they'll find me. Can't you blow it yourself? If it's your way of calling each other. Aye, sir, but, um, i'm fair out of breath From taking such long strides. It's hard for a lassie to keep up with a man. Uh... There. Oh, now, now that was barely a toot. I don't suppose you could blow it A wee bit louder? Oh, it takes a strong man To blow a lusty blast. I am a strong man. Aye, sir. They must've heard that. Again! No, that must suffice. Of course, if you're tired. Tired? Thank you. That was grand. What's that? That's them. Good-Bye and thank you. Hurry, joe talley. Hurry, we'll be needing you. Oh, doctor. You'll be proud of me this night. If you're wise, wearyworld, You'll go home and go to your bed. Hey, hey, hey, mccollum. Hey, mrs. Macintosh. Throw all your weapons. It's my duty to arrest any man with a weapon. Go home and go to bed. North roaders, We'll find your families Gathered at the brae. What's happening? The soldiers are coming. ...in the cemetery. The south roaders will march From the tame to cushing. And mind you, Let no man tell the name of Any who took part in the last riots. Remember, you're all dumb critters, And none know who tied the policeman to the cart. Andrew struthers. Rob dow. Snecky hobart. Hendry munn. Tammas whammond, And all of you who are auld licht, Lay down your weapons. Let me have my fling this night, And I promise youI'll bide sober for a twelvemonth. Oh, rob. Rob. Are you the man i prayed with an hour ago? Aye. Down with your weapons, OrI'll brain you with them. Aye, lay them down. But keep your feet on them. If you fight, your wives and children May be shot in the streets. These soldiers have come for a dozen of you. Will you be benefited if they take away 100? Aye! Hearken to him! There's a gypsy. Aye. She'll tell us. If I were a man, I wouldn't let myself be catched Like a mouse in a trap. How dare you, woman. What kind of women are you, That bid your menfolk go to jail, When a bold front would lead them to safety? Do you want to be husbandless and homeless? Disperse, I command you. This abandoned woman is inciting a riot. Dinna heed this little man. You men and women of thrums know That I wish you well. There is not much time. The soldiers will be here before you know it, And then it'll be too late. She has a false tongue. Don't listen to the brazen woman. She tells us the truth. Listen to her. She brought us the news. You all run in different directions, you're lost, But if you keep together, You can force the way into the country, where you can scatter. That's what the captain of the soldiers is afraid you'll do. Aye, that's a good thought, egyptian. Then that's what we will do! That's what you will not do. The truth is not in this wicked woman. The soldiers! The soldiers are coming! We need the men. They're here! They're here! You see! You see! Put down your weapons. Come along! Follow me! Women! Gather the divots. The bigger the better. Did you see how she flouted me? That I did. Come on! Men, get ready to run. Women to the left side till I give the word. Yeah, but they'll fire. Have no fear. They'll no fire. Destroy! Don't fling those stones. Turn them down the trail. Gentlemen, advance and hem them in. Oh, if I could only fling straight. Get him. Woman. You're a dear. Only 6 prisoners, your lordship. The whole thing has been a fiasco Because you did not take them by surprise. It isn't like it if the soldiers Spread the news that they were coming. The men didn't even know their own destination. We'll find out something when We lay our hands on that gypsy. Lord rintoul? Yes? I am gavin dishart, The auld licht minister. I am happy to know you, mr. Dishart. This is the sheriff and captain halliwell. How do you do? I am told you've done good service tonight In the interest of peace and order. Thank you, lord rintoul, But i'm afraid the gypsy had More influence with the people tonight than I had. You don't happen to know Who gave the warning signal, Do you, mr. Dishart? Signal? What signal? The horn. 3 blasts of the horn. Horn? 3 blasts. No. No, I- I didn't know. You look very tired, mr. Dishart. Yes. Yes, I am. I came to ask you to be as lenient as you can With these poor men you've arrested. They're so easily misled. As we all are. I'll attend to the weavers. They will not be dealt with too harshly, But they must learn not to throw stones and clods At soldiers performing their duty. Oh, yes. You're quite right, sir, of course. If you'll pardon me, i shall go. Good night, mr. Dishart. Good night. And let me thank you again For all you did for us tonight. You set a wonderful example. Thank you. Halt! The soldiers, dear. Oh, it's you, mr. Dishart, And your lady. We dare not allow anyone to pass Without knowing who they are. You haven't found the gypsy, then? No, ma'am, but we have her closed in. We'll get her soon. I thought I might be able to help Some of these unhappy people, But I could do so little. Sadly little. It's no scene for a lady, ma'am, but your husband- Uh- Did you say something, mr. Dishart? Yes, i - My dear, I quite agree with you. So we needn't detain the captain. I'm only a sergeant, ma'am. Oh, indeed. And how long are you To remain in thrums? Just a few hours, mrs. Dishart. If the gypsy girl had not given so much trouble, We might have been gone by now. Oh, yes. Well, i'm sure She'll never slip through your fingers, sergeant. Sergeant, I must- You must indeed, dear. You're sadly tired. Good night, sergeant. Your servant, mrs. Dishart, Your servant, sir. But- Come, love. You woman. It was beautiful. It was iniquitous, And I a minister. You can't help that. No, I could not help it. No blame attaches to me. No, no, no, no, no. I meant you couldn't help being a minister. Now, you could've helped saving me, And I thank you so much. Don't dare to thank me. I forbid you to say that I saved you. I did my best to hand you over to the soldiers. Why didn't you hand me over, then? All you had to say was, "This is the person you're in search of. " I didn't have my hand over your mouth. Oh, it's all over, and no one will know. You're not angry with me, are you? Angry? Angry? Oh, I was afraid you were. No, they're not gone. It's not yet too late. Why don't you shout to them? I do not understand you. On the hill and in the square, You spoke as broadly as any woman in thrums. Now you fling a cloak over your shoulders And become a fine lady. Perhaps it was the cloak That bewitched me. Aye, it was just the cloak, For i'm a pure ignorant bit lassie again. My, certainly, but clothes does Make a difference to a woman. This is sheer levity. Good-Bye, if you're not to give me up. I'm not a policeman. Surely we part friends, then? No. I hope never to see your face again. Now, I cannot help your not liking my face, But there's a splotch of mud On your own, little minister, That came off a divot you flung at the captain. There are soldiers at the top of the hill. I can't escape that way. There's no other way. Ah, won't you help me again? Why do you do that? She'll see us. She? Oh, your- My mother. Oh. Only your mother? Only. Let me tell you, She may suffer more than you For your behavior tonight. How could she? If you're caught, won't it be discovered That I helped you to escape? I thought you said you didn't. Yes, I helped you. What would my congregation say If they knew i'd let you pass yourself off As my wife? I'm sorry. It's not the punishment from them i'm afraid of, But from my conscience. No, that's not true. I do fear exposure, for my mother's sake. She's had such trials as you cannot know of, And now, when, at last, I seemed able to do something for her, You destroy our happiness. You have her life in your hands. Where are you going? To give myself up. Do not be alarmed. I'll clear you. Stop! Why do you not hide in the manse garden? Nobody will look for you there. You're a good man. I like you. Don't say that. Here's the summer-Seat. Listen... I do believe you've liked me all the time. Can a man like a woman against his will? Of course he can. That's thevery nicest way to be liked. Good night. You will find my text in the book of ezra. The eighth chapter of ezra. Stop making a windmill of your bible. That's chronicles. There is ruth, when she isn't wanted. But it looks as if ezra had jumped clean out of the bible. You will find my text in genesis. Chapter 3, verse 6: The fall of man through the temptation of woman. "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, "And that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise, "She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, And gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. " Until a woman ate of the tree of good and evil, There was no sin in the world! Adam was an erring man... But beside eve, he was respectable. This errand wouldn't seem so unpleasant to you, mr. Dishart, If you smoked. Of course, going to the poorhouse is bitter medicine For old nanny, or any woman to have to take. But after all, the poorhouse is not a jail. Have I fallen deaf on my left ear, too? Mr. Dishart... Were you ever in love? What? Never! Well, well! Don't terrify the horse. Maybe I should have come alone. If you pray, she's sure to break down. Couldn't you pray cheerfully, mr. Dishart? You don't look very cheerful yourself, doctor. Nonsense. I have no patience with false sentiments. Well, nanny, you see i've come And i've brought mr. Dishart with me. Thank you kindly, sirs. Please to take a chair. No, no, nanny. It's best we go at once. Oh, no! No! But nanny, you must remember what I told you about the poor. The place you're going to-It's a fine house, And you'll be very happy in it. Aye,I'll be happy in it. But if I could just have stayed on here, though I wasn't happy. But think of the fine food you'll get: Broth nearly every day! It'll be terrible enjoyable. And there'll always be pleasant company for you there. Why, after you've been there a week, you won't be the same woman. That's it! No, no! I'll be a woman on the poor rates. Oh, mother, mother... You little thought when you bore me That I would come to this! Well, we must go. Put on your cap, nanny. I don't need to put on a cap. I've got a bonnet. Are you sure there's nobody looking? Nobody in sight, nanny. I'm a base woman not to be more thankful to them that's been so good to me. Oh, mother! I wish terrible they had come and taken me at night. This is more than I can stand. I've tried you, sir, But, oh, i'm grateful... And i'm ready now. I cannot help it. Have pity on her, o god. O god, you might. This is no place for you. They're taking me to the poorhouse! Don't let them. How dare you! You don't see- I see two hulking men Dragging a poor, weak little woman away from her home. You poor dear. I won't let them take you away. Go! Sympathy is not meal and bedclothes, And these are what she needs. And you, who live in luxury, Would send her to the poorhouse for them. Tuts! Mr. Dishart gives more to the poor Than any man in thrums, And he's not to be preached to by a gypsy! We're waiting for you, nanny. Aye. I'm coming. I'll have to go, lassie. No, you're not going. It's these men who are going. Go, sirs, and leave us. And you will take care of nanny? Aye. And where's the money coming from? Oh, the money. Oh... Oh, i'd forgotten. 7 shillings a week. Oh! Oh, is that all? Well, she shall have it. When? At once. No, it's not possible tonight, ButI'll bring 5 pounds tomorrow. No,I'll send it. No, you must come for it. You will meet me tuesday, at this hour, At, say, the old mill. No, I won't! How can a vagrant have 5 pounds in her purse When she hasn't 5 shillings on her back? Look at my ring. Do you know its value? There's a quirk in this. Mr. Dishart, give nanny your arm. I'll carry the box... Unless you trust this woman's word. You do trust me. Yes... I trust you. You dasn't have an appointment with this gypsy. Think what they'll be saying in thrums! Send someone. No. He must come himself... Alone. So be it. And I hope her stocking foot is full of gold, For your sake, nanny... Or now that i'm here, I'll make her go down the road. Will you come, mr. Dishart? No. I'll walk home, doctor. Well, will you come outside a minute? Who can she be? You saw how easily she put the scotch tongue on and off. She's as much a mystery to me as she is to you. I daresay she's one of those wealthy gypsies from the south. They're said to have a very grand manner when they like. Look here, young man. A man's second childhood begins when a woman gets hold of him. Oh! Don't alarm yourself about me, doctor. Ah, well. Good luck. But be wary. Nanny and I are to have a cup of tea. Do you think we should invite the minister, nanny? We couldn't dare. You'll excuse her, mr. Dishart, for the presumption. Don't be so free- He's the auld licht minister. Ohh. There isn't any water! Well, get some. Lassie! Mind who you're speaking to. To send a minister to the well! I will go. Where's the well? Give me the pitcher, mr. Dishart. What a talking there would be if you were seen with it! Don't you think so? Nanny, for shame! How can you expect to follow our conversation When you listen only to mr. Dishart? What? She was saying, nanny- I was saying that he is married. But the minister has no wife, babbie. No? Oh... Well, I did wonder at any mere woman's daring to marry such a minister. But it was one of the soldiers that told me about his wife. He said that mr. Dishart introduced her to him. Soldiers? Never trust a soldier, lassie. Nanny, I was told that she was rather like me. Heaven forbid! What? I'm no meaning, but you're the bonniest lass I ever saw Out of a picture book. But you would know mr. Dishart's contempt for bonny faces If you'd heard his sermon against women. That was an excellent cup of tea, nanny. Wasn't it? When did he preach against women, nanny? Oh, it was long ago. Not so very long- It was the sabbath After the soldiers was in thrums, The day you changed your text so hurriedly. I forbid you to repeat that story, nanny! What made you change your text, mr. Dishart? I... I suddenly thought of a better one. Oh. Well, I must go. I, too. Which way do you take? Not yours, mr. Dishart. I go into the wood and vanish. Good day, nanny. Thank you, lassie, for your kindness. NowI'll have peace to the end of my days, And I wish the same to you with all my heart. Oh, i've read my fortune, nanny, And there's not much happiness in it. I hope that's not true. Do you really care? Yes, I care. Because you don't know me. Because I do know you. Well, I believe that you misunderstand me less Than those who have known me longer. Babbie... Oh, i'm glad to hear you say that. I thought you did not really like me Because you never called me by my name. That wasn't the reason. I dared not speak your name, or I would have said more- Oh, I was wrong. You don't understand me at all. Oh... good day, nanny. As soon as I have the money,I'll bring it to you. Oh, what a pity he's a minister. Ah, rob! You're just in time To hear a query about the minister. Rob, mr. Dishart has fallen in... What do they call the thing, hendry? In love. Now we know what he was doing in the country yesterday. Who is the woman? Aye, who is she? If we only knew. That's what we've been asking ourselves. Well, if you ken nothing about her, And you ken she exists... We know all about her, except who she is. And we also know the minister's acting very strangely. Aye. I saw him come out of the manse, And walk straight into a gooseberry bush. And I saw him come down The school road this morning, And the wind blew off his hat. The wind's always looking for hats on the school road. Maybe... but I didn't like the way he ran after it. But he couldn't afford to lose his hat! Aye. But he should have run after it more reverently. Not that i'm criticizing him. Criticizing. Hah! You all make an idol of the man. It's true. Aye, but we cannot help it. Yet if he were to be led astray, I'd be the first to cut him out of my heart. I'd rise against him, And the whole congregation would rise with me And pronounce his doom. John, man, you make me shiver to the marrow! Yes, I believe in you. But henceforth, you must send your money to nanny by another messenger. You're a gypsy... and i'm a minister. I refuse to see you again. I'm not angry with you, but as a minister- the lady looked o'er her window so high and oh, but she looked weary and there she spied the great argyle, come to- What are you doing up there? Come down at once! "come down, come down, lady margaret," he said- If you don't come down this instant and give me What I was foolish enough to come for... I wouldn't have kissed thee, great argyle I wouldn't have kissed thee fairly- You've deceived nanny, and brought me here to make fun of me. I'll have no more to do with you. I'm coming down, And i've got the money. Did you know that you were speaking to yourself? Oh, you're mistaken. I was speaking to you. I was saying that... there is a difference Between a minister and a gypsy. But if i'm willing to overlook it... I cannot allow you to talk disrespectfully of my calling. It's the highest a man can follow. I suppose one must be very clever To be a minister. Oh- And it must be nice to be able to speak for a whole hour To people who can neither answer nor run away. Is it true that before you start to preach, You lock the doors, to keep the congregation in? I must leave you if you talk that way. Well, i... I only wanted to know. Tell me who you are, babbie. I want to know your people, your father and mother. Why? Because I like their daughter. Oh, you are really good. But you will never know my parents. Are they dead? Maybe. But babbie, the time has come when I must know Everything of you that is to be known. You're no gypsy. No? That dress is but a disguise. Oh. Where did you get that ring? Why - Tell me how you got it! I must know. Must know-? Where did you get that ring? Good afternoon to you! It's not good afternoon. It's good-Bye forever, unless you answer me. As you please. I will not tell you where I got my ring. It's no affair of yours. Yes, babbie, it is. Well? I thought you were going. I was... Brushing my hat. You want me to go? You can go if you like. But you said... No, I didn't. You're... You're crying! Because you're so unfeeling! What have I said? What have I done? Oh, I should have gone away at once! Ohh! You're hardhearted and cruel! What have I done? You said you wished you'd gone away! But surely you asked me to go! How can you say that? Ohh! On my word i thought you did! And now i've made you unhappy. Oh, babbie, i'm a hopeless lout. Oh, no, you're really not. Babbie... i... I've never kissed a woman before. Before what, little minister? Oh! Uh... Ohh. Ohh. Ohhhh! If I were a man, I should choose to be everything i'm not And nothing that I am. I would scorn to be a liar. I would try to fight the world honestly, but... but... I'm only a woman, and so... well... That's the kind of a man i'd like to marry! A minister may be all these things. The man I could love must not spend his days in idleness As the men I know do. I do not. He must be brave, no mere worker among others, But a leader of men- All ministers are. Who makes his influence felt, assuredly. And takes the side of the weak against the strong, Even if the strong be in the right. Always my tendency. A man who has a mind of his own, and having once made it up, Stands to it in defiance- Of his congregation. Of the world. He must understand me, i do. And compel me to do his bidding; Yes, even thrash me if- If you won't listen to- He must not yield to my coaxing Or temper- That would be weakness! He must rule me. He must be my- Your lord and master! Babbie, i am that man! If you'd come home, father, The minister might never ken you broke your promise And took a wee drop. I don't care what the minister kens. He's not the man i thought him. Be off with you! Aye! So this is what your conversion amounts to. If you were half a man, rob dow, The very thought of what mr. Dishart has done for you Would make you run past the public houses. It's the thought of him sends me running to them! Leave me alone. Not till you tell me Why you of all people are speaking against the minister. Say again that I was speaking against the minister AndI'll practice on you what I intend for her. Who is she? Who's what? The woman whom the minister- I said nothing about a woman! Doctor, i'm ready to swear before a bailie I never saw them together at the old mill. The old mill! Poof! You only mean the egyptian. Aye. Make your mind easy about this, rob. I know why he met her there. Do you know that she has bewitched him? Do you know that I saw him trying to put his arms around her? Do you know they have a trysting place At the old mill? No, no, doctor! I'm drunk! Roaring drunk! Ha ha! It wasn't the minister I saw at all. It was another man. Was not that lightning? I think not, mother. Don't be frightened. I'm never frightened when you're with me. And I always will be with you. Aye. But if you were married? Do you think that would make any difference to you? Except that you'd have a daughter to love and take care of you, As well as a son. Gavin, I often think you would be better married. But when it comes to selecting the woman, I grow fearful. I wonder what sort of woman would content you. Of course, she would be a member of auld licht. Aye, gavin, a truly religious wife Would be a great help to you. Religious. If a woman is good, she is religious, mother. A good woman who has been, Let us say, foolishly brought up Needs only to be shown the right way. I question whether any man, minister or layman, Ever yet fell in love because a woman was thrifty or clever, Or went to church twice on the sabbath. I believe that is true. But as you said yourself In the pulpit two weeks ago, It's an awful thing to worship only at a beautiful face. Mother, you think too much about what I say in the pulpit. I hope that lightning stops soon. I don't think there will be any more. Good night, gavin. Good night. And don't sit up any later. No. Babbie, what is it? Nothing. I must go. Babbie, tell me what's happened To bring you here at this hour. I thought that you'd be glad to see me. I'm very sorry to see you. Well, then i'll go at once. Yes, you must go at once. Then I won't. Yes, you will. Henceforth, you must do as I see fit. Since when have you taken command of me? Since a moment ago, when you let me kiss you. Let you? Oh, you did it yourself. I was very angry. No, you were not. Come. I'll carry the lantern. You're not going with me? That I am. Oh, but I won't let you. When I say i'm going, i mean i'm going. Take my arm. No, I won't. Take my arm. Your hat! What? Your- Oh. Don't you care? No. Oh, dear. Wait. Wait, I see someone coming. I've seen him for some time. Turn back, dear. If he sees you with me, all thrums will be in an uproar. I cannot help that. But why should you suffer for me? You're mine. Mr. Dishart. Good evening, doctor. I met mr. Dishart quite by accident- Doctor, it's quite natural you should wonder Why we're here at this hour. You needn't explain to me, mr. Dishart. I'm not your congregation. That's true. I shall explain nothing. Dr. Mcqueen, if you're going past nanny webster's cottage, Perhaps you wouldn't mind my walking along with you. That will save mr. Dishart the trouble of coming farther. Aye, i'm going past nanny's. Take my arm, lassie. Tomorrow, dear. I'll come to nanny's after church. Good night, mr. Dishart. You love him, too. I do that. There's trouble ahead for him If he's tangled up with you. Ohh. G- A-V-I-N. Gavin dishart. Babbie dishart. oh, the very, very, very, very very, very, very reverend mrs. Gavin dishart Why are you crying, laddie? I'm nae crying. What's your name? Micah's my name. Rob dow's my father, And he's taken to the drink again. What are you doing up there? I'm wishing. It's a wishing stone. You're wishing your father wouldn't drink. Nae, i'm not. There was a long time he didna drink. But the woman has him start again. It's about her that i'm wishing. I'm wishing she was dead. What woman is it? I dinna ken, but she's a bad one. Did you never see her in your father's house? No. She ever came there, He would break her over his knee. But if he hates her, How can she have such power over him? It's nae him that she has hold of. Who is it? It's mr. Dishart. How could that send your father to the drink? Because my father's terrible fond of him. And when the folk find out about the woman, They'll stone the minister out of thrums! Why do you run from me? I'm afraid of you! You're the woman! What makes you think that? Because you're so bonny. You might go away, If you knew what a difference Mr. Dishart made in my father when he came. How have you such an ill will at the minister? If finishing comes to the minister, His old mother will die. I'll give you my rabbit if you'll go away. I've just the one. Oh, well, i'll give you them both, Though I might be sorry to part with spotty. Keep your rabbits, laddie, And cry no more. I'm going away. And you'll never come back no more? All your life? Never no more. All my life. And you'll leave the minister alone? Forever and ever? Forever and ever. We could go to paris, and go to the opera. Is this a secret, barbara? It's nothing at all, evalina. No, I was merely saying, aunt evalina, That paris would be such a wonderful place for a honeymoon. Paris is a long way off. And so, alas, is our honeymoon. It needn't be. Oh. Do you mean, sir, That I may marry you tomorrow if I wish? Ha ha ha. I do, barbara. Then I accept. It appears to me a very unseemly subject about which to jest. I was not jesting. Nor am i, evalina. Oh. I think we've delayed long enough. Why shouldn't we be married soon? Not tomorrow, naturally, But in a fortnight, say. Oh! Oh, please don't object. Everything can easily be got ready, And it is so dreary waiting. If my brother wishes to rush into this marriage, It certainly is no concern of mine. Are you really impatient to marry me, my little babbie? Aren't you impatient to be away from here yourself? Yes, I am. Marry me in a fortnight, barbara. Ha! in a fortnight in a fortnight i'll marry you You can put rob dow in jail for this. That's what I was trying to do, But he wouldn't come with me. Good day to you, doctor. How are you, tammas? Hello, mr. Whammond. Would you like to see the bump on my head? What can I do for you, tammas? There's nothing you can do for me, doctor. But the elders of auld licht Think you should call upon mr. Dishart. We fear he's nae very well. Oh. What do you think is the matter with him? That's for you to tell us. It might be overwork. Then again, it might not. Well, I don't think it's very serious. If he wants me, he'll send for me. He'll nae send. He doesna think he's sick. Perhaps he isn't. If he isna, he's in a worse state. I only hope he is sick. I'll come back and explain myself later. When you're alone. Ha! He doesna want me to hear about mr. Dishart. But I could tell him more than he could tell me. What can you tell about mr. Dishart? Well, it was only two nights ago When I was coming through caddam wood, And I heard with my own two ears The minister ask the gypsy chief If he knew the whereabouts of the egyptian woman. He called her "babbie. " Do you see that? Aye. If you repeat that to anybody-Anybody- I'll cut your throat with it. You understand? How could I repeat it, doctor? Nobody speaks or listens to me. My lord, you shouldn't have come in here. It's very bad luck To see the bride in her wedding gown Before the ceremony. I couldn't wait to see how you look tomorrow. And it's lovely. Well, i'm sorry. You're tired, my dear. I'll sew the flowers on later. I'll come back, miss, and help you off with your dress. No, uh, no, i can do it myself. Ohh... Nanny! Mercy on us, lassie. Have you risen from the dead? Hello, nanny. I've brought you some money. I hope you haven't gone without. No, no, lassie. Mr. Dishart's been here every day you've been away. Mr. Dishart? How is he? Well, I don't know how to say it, But something has come over the minister. He's not himself. The whole town's noticed it. And some of them try to say it's a woman. But I canna believe that, and him such a scholar. Can you? Why, you're crying. Lassie, what has come over you? Oh, nothing, it's just that i'm going away And I won't see you again. Is it me or is it... Babbie, don't tell me you've got overfond of mr. Dishart. Oh, my poor lassie. What does it matter who he is When you canna help it? Babbie, does the minister- No. No, nanny. Please. Oh, dear, oh, dear. That's it. He loves you, too, babbie. No, he'll never see me again. Good-Bye, nanny. I'll not forget you. Good-Bye. Mr. Dishart! Mr. Dishart? He must not see me! Hurry, go outside. And don't let him come in. Swear you will not. Hurry, hurry! Good evening, nanny. Why, mr. Dishart. Good evening. Isn't it time you put that up for the day? Come,I'll help you in with it. Oh, no, no, sir. Thank you. You'll nae mind if I go on with my work for a while. No, of course not, nanny. AndI'll just here and rest for a few minutes. Nanny, what do you think has become of her? Who? Oh, you mean the gypsy? Oh, where do the flies vanish to in the winter? Those gadabout bodies, They canna be happy in one place for long. But she was different. Aye, she was that. But she was only a gypsy girl. You canna get away from that. Yes, she was only a gypsy girl. But I had hoped that she would be my wife. Mr. Dishart! That's my prayer meeting. I will bid you good night, nanny. Oh, god, you canna mean for them to bury their youth so soon. Look at me. What is anything when you're old Without somebody? Mr. Dishart! Yes, nanny. What is it? Uh... Oh, my wheel. Would you mind? Why, of course not, nanny. How was he, nanny? Did he ask about- Babbie. No, no. Babbie, tell me why you've left me all this time. You cannot know what i've gone through. There is something i must tell you. Tell me that you love me first. No, no, you will not ask me to say that When I tell you what I am. I'm to be married tomorrow. Married. I'm to be married to lord rintoul. You... Can't you just say that You will try to forgive me before I go? Won't you even look at me? Not that way. I meant no harm. I swear I didn't. I didn't even know what I was doing Until it was too late. And then I meant never to see you again. When I came into your life, I was wild and careless. So little heeding, i never even dreamed. You don't blame the birds When their song comes for a moment Between you and your work. You smile and forgive them. Let it be that way with me. It is myself I cannot forgive. I have been a dull-Witted fool. But I cannot understand Why you should have acted so strangely. The gypsy clothes you wore- I have no wish to excuse myself. But have you ever seen a gypsy cart Where there's sort of hammocks swung beneath it In which gypsy children are carried about The countryside? That was the only cradle i've ever known. But one day, I suppose the road was rough For I was thrown out. I can remember picking myself up After a little and running after the cart. But they-They didn't hear my cries, Or if they did, they didn't come back for me. I like to think that my mother did come back for me And then went away again When she heard that I was in better hands than hers. It was lord rintoul who found me. And so I owe everything to him. He took me home on his horse And paid his gardner's wife to rear me. Afterwards, he sent me to fine schools. He's lavished everything upon me. He has been very kind to you. Yes, he's been very kind to me. And i'm to marry him. Does he love you? No. He doesn't know what love is. Nor did i... Until... You were laughing at me all the time. Only a little... At first, but not afterwards. You never cared for me at all. Always. Always since I first knew what love was. And it was you who taught me. That night in the manse garden. Do you remember? I knew that I could... Never again be altogether unhappy. All my life I would have that to remember. And when I went away, So that I would not bring disgrace And wretchedness upon you and your mother I was strong. Your love had made me strong. I'm going now. Don't think of me as unhappy. It will be happiness for me to try to be All you thought I was. Your face will always come between me And ungenerous hearts. Babbie! I cannot let you go. Don't tell me that you love me still. Oh, gavin, Do you? We will go to lord rintoul at once. You are mine, and I will tell him so. He will release you when he hears of me. Oh, how little you know him. His only interest in you Will be to turn the town against you. He has great influence here. I can defend myself. Nothing but duty of the highest kind Could keep mr. Dishart so long. Aye, but, snecky, i do not like it. Why, mrs. Mcclarin. My john's got to be at work At 5:00 in the morning. We cannot wait longer. Aye. Come along, nancy. Did mr. Dishart have any calls to make after his tea? I don't know. He uh... He was nae home for tea. He was nae home for tea. I think there's something to the talk- What talk? I've heard no talk. AndI'll cut the tongue out of any man who has So that he'd no repeat it. Oh, I did nae hear it myself, I only heard of a man that did hear of it. He saw him. He saw the minister. Come in here. What's sam langlins doing here? He's no auld licht. He says the minister came to his place Not 10 minutes ago asking to hire a carriage. What? Hire a carriage! Aye. While we're sitting here waiting for him. Where did he go? Samuel cannot tell. Because he said he would nae let a horse Of his out on a night like this. Not for no auld licht. Well... Most likely he was going on some errand of mercy. Aye! But samuel said he had a woman with him. I see nothing to do But to dismiss the congregation And notify mr. Dishart That the pulpit is vacant. I'm thinking he can hardly explain his actions To the satisfaction of this session. Mr. Whammond, don't be hasty. Maybe it's nae his fault. Mind your place, rob dow. Putting yourself on the equal With the elders of this kirk. Have mercy on him. God himself would give him a second chance. Rob dow, what can you know Of the ways of god? That's true. I know little. But, oh, mr. Whammond, you know. Then why should the minister be punished For what's no his fault? It's the gypsies. I saw her! You saw her? With mr. Dishart? No, no, i didn't see them. Out with it, rob dow! Or as chief elder of this kirk I say it will be the worse for him. You saw them together. He didn't have his arms around her. It was her wrapping her coils around him. May I burn forever if this is no true. He had his arms around her! I tell you, he didn't. It was her! The minister! The gypsy! Quiet. Hendry munn, As chief elder of this kirk, I command you to go and dismiss the congregation. I hereby pronounce this congregation dismissed While the session prepares to do its duty. Oh, jean! Jean proctor! It's a terrible thing they're saying Against the minister, is it no? Did they say the woman's name? You leave me be. You've got no right to talk like that. Easy, jean, easy. Remember, i'm police. The impudent baggage. But i'd rather go with you, gavin, please! No, you will wait at the manse Until I get back. Dr. Mcqueen has offered me his carriage Many a time- Mr. Dishart! Mr. Dishart! It's not for me to remind you, But have you not forgot your prayer meeting? Prayer meeting. Half of them has gone home. Uh, yes, thank you. Gavin, did you have a prayer meeting? Yes, but, but, i'll go as soon- No, no, you must go at once. If you think it's storming here, You ought to see it over at the kirk. Come, dear,I'll see you to the manse. Gavin, go to your church immediately, For my sake. I'll go to the manse. Please. I shall then. Weary will go with you. Aye. Hurry. You'll wait for me? Aye. I'll not be long. Uh? Ach. Oh, it's a weary world, And women is the most uncanniest things in it. Mrs. Dishart? Why, no, she- What did you want? Who are you? Uh... I'm a friend of mr. Dishart's. He told me to wait for him here. Where is the minister? He's going over to his church. It's true then what they say. He was with you. Oh, how could you?! How could you let him stay away From his prayer meeting? I didn't know. Do you think if i had known that i... I love him. I could near believe it From the look in your eyes. And yet... Have you no heard He's been put out of his church? Oh, no. But he done nothing wrong. I'll go and tell them. No, no. Don't. They'd never listen to you. Who is it, jean? It's... It's just somebody to see the minister, ma'am. SayI'll be right down. It's the mistress. Oh, if we could only keep it from her. She'll have to learn, but- Tell her never to mind. Tell her I couldn't wait, i've gone. Good evening. I'm mrs. Dishart, The minister's mother. How do you do? Isn't it a dreadful night? Put on the kettle, jean. He won't be long. His meeting is over, Or jean ought not be back. Child, you're shivering. And wet. Come in here by the fire. Jean will be in with the tea directly. Oh, let me have that wet cape. Just sit here. I'll have jean dry this. Child... Why, you're crying. Now, now. Don't do that. Mrs. Dishart, What if I were to tell you that You were no longer to be The mistress of this manse? And that it was because of me? You're the girl my son loves. Oh, I think I almost knew it in my heart When I first saw you. I have so wondered what you would be like. Has he told you about me? No. But when a young man tells his mother That if the right girl comes along He will marry so that she will have a daughter To love and care for her, too, The mother knows That the right girl isn't so very far away. Gavin will tell you, My prayers have ever been for his happiness. In that, I will see my own. Good evening, mr. Whammond. The... The minister, he's no home. You sure of that? Aye, i'm sure. Where is he? He's gone to the church. How do you know? Because that's where he said he was going. Then you've seen him. Was anybody with him? No, no, mr. Whammond. If he's no at the kirk, We'll be back, jean proctor. We'll have words with him this night. I could swear I heard somebody talking inside. We'll have a look through the window. Who was it, jean? I, uh... Oh. It was mr. Whammond, ma'am, To say that the minister Would be late at the church. And he came through all this rain to tell me, The chief elder. Why didn't you ask him in? He... He seemed to be in a terrible hurry, ma'am. That's a pity. Jean. Aye, ma'am? The... the blind was up a bit, And I thought... I want you to go upstairs, jean. And on the top shelf in my wardrobe You'll find a wee box. Wait. I think i'd better go myself. Oh, no, please. It's getting late. Some other time. It won't take but a minute. I want you to see how light his hair used to be. They're out there. It's her. It's the woman. In our manse. She's terrible grand for a gypsy. Did you see that dress? I'm thinking she stole it. Aye. What can we do? It will kill her. Go upstairs, jean, And keep her from coming down. I'll try to get rid of them. What can i say to her? Anything, anything. It doesn't matter. Hurry. Um... Um... Won't you come in? Jean is upstairs with mrs. Dishart, So I answered the door for her. Please come in. The cheek of her! I'll have the fire nice and bright For you in a minute. There is nothing like a nice bright fire When you've been out in the rain. Is it still coming down as hard as ever? Woman... What are you doing here? The minister was kind enough To give me shelter out of the rain. If he hadn't, I don't know what I should have done. He is no longer our minister. And he no longer has the right To shelter anybody under this roof. Where is he? He has gone to the church To explain to you Why he was not at his prayer meeting. We know why. Do you or do you no deny That he had his arms around you This night? See? We know everything. No, you don't. If you did, You would know we've done Nothing to be ashamed of. Aye. We're well aware that you have no shame. But the minister... Making lover's meetings stealthily by night With a- That's not true. You should not need to be told That your minister is incapable of such a thing. And there's something more you ought to know. I am- Silence, woman! Do you stand there and tell a man That's been an elder of the kirk 6 and 20 years what he ought to know? Where's mrs. Dishart? I'll have the keys. Oh, now please. You're not gonna tell her. At least let her hear it from his own lips. It will not sound so cruel. I must do my duty. Oh. Out of my way, woman. No. Would you have me dishonored In the sight of god? Dishonored in the sight of god Because you might permit your heart To rule your stubborn mind? Because you might refrain from speaking The word that will destroy This innocent woman's happiness? She's coming down. I could not keep her longer. Please. I'm sorry for what i've said. I know you must be a kind man, But don't tell her it tonight. Let her learn it tomorrow. It can be no great sin To give her one more happy night. I'll go away. I'll never see him again. I swear it- She's coming. Oh, mr. Whammond. Did the rain drive you back? Here, put this on. It will keep you warm. Oh, you shouldn't have come out On a night like this Just to relieve my mind. I did no come to relieve your mind. Aye, mr. Munn, and mr. Spens. Oh, I know it wasn't for me. But for my son. But, mr. Whammond, Is that going to make me think the less of you? Here. Give me your things. No, I cannot stop. I have something here i want you to see. I brought it down to show the young lady. I know you'll be interested, too. Come and sit down. Here, mr. Whammond, In the minister's chair. It's no intended for me To sit in the minister's chair. But the mantle of chief elder Of the auld licht kirk Has been wrapped around me, And I must do my duty. Aye, and don't you. The minister's always telling me How he couldn't carry on his work Without you- And you, mr. Munn. And you, too, mr. Spens. Let's see. His hair. His baby hair. Do no give it to me. Do not give me that bit hair. You won't hurt it. If fondling would hurt it, It wouldn't be here now. I cannot help boasting about him a little. He's been so terribly near me always. Mrs. Dishart, Your son may be all the earth to you, But my eldership is as much to me. Of course. Not everybody can be a minister. But I know well a chief elder's work Is just as worthy in the lord's sight. Though, of course, It doesn't require the education. Oh, you must be cold. I'll have jean bring you some tea. Now, now. Thank you. I was wrong. You're a good man. Silence, woman. What came over you, thomas? Why did you no speak out? Quiet. Did you no see how I struggled To bring out the words. No. It's no true. My mouth snappeth shut like a box. Thomas whammond has been unfaithful. 6 and 20 years have i been an elder Of the kirk in god's service. And don't you think he stood closer to you The last 5 minutes Than in all those 6 and 20 years? Hold your peace, woman. I'll make amends. Now, do not let her get the start of you this time. And do not let her put a cup of tea in your hand Or you're gone again. Just come right out and say it. I know what to say. It's the saying of it. Mr. Dishart, I can no neglect my duty. Your duty is to your minister. Peter tosh, unlock that door. I will not. He has a knife! Open the door, peter tosh, Before I open your neck! Rob, don't! Mr. Whammond! Thomas! What is it? It's the minister. What? The minister. What's happened? Peter tosh was locking up the kirk Though more than half the congregation Were about when the minister came. What is it? The minister demanded that peter open the door. But peter wouldn't do it. Rob dow, With a knife in his hand, Shouts, "open that door, peter tosh, OrI'll open your neck. " Nobody stopped him? The minister. He tried to. Where is he? Where is he?! They're bringing him. They have to take it slow. Has anybody gone for the doctor? Aye. Thomas, where's his mother. Here he comes. Put me down. Now then... You're here to accuse me, So out with it. There is no need to spare me. Tonight I was seen in the company of this lady... When I should have been at my church. I may have seemed to sin against you... But believe me, What happened is not for you Or any other man to judge. All I can say is This is the woman of my choice. She's not what you think her. But she were, That would make not the slightest difference to me. If she's unworthy of your reverence, Then so am i. We belong to each other. And I am blessed more than I deserve In knowing she's mine. And no mortal man shall part us. And now... Oh! Oh. Gavin. My boy. Mother... You mustn't cry. I won't. I was frightened at first. But i'm not anymore. He wouldn't let anything happen to you. Babbie? Darling. It's all because of me, gavin. Because of you... Life has a new meaning. If god takes me now I shall have known love. And had happiness. Yes. It's the doctor. Let me pass, please. Everybody out. Everybody out! Clear the room. Mrs. Dishart, Fetch me a bowl of very hot water. You better go, too. Oh, doctor- You'll help me most by leaving the room. Please. And tell jean to bring that hot water. Darling, Don't die. Please, god... He's so good. He really deserves your help. The people in thrum need him so. And I need him, too. Oh, please, ma'am, Please try before it gets cold again. I can't eat, darling. Can't you? Never mind, jean. I hear the doctor stirring.
