How could we have known that war never trades in such certainties? For where nothing is unthinkable... ... anything can be true. Even a lie. - Anyone sitting there? - No. For one dreadful moment, I thought it was going to be standing room only. It's all airmen and sappers down back. Nice enough, but... - Here, have one of mine. - I'm all right, thanks. Sorry. Cannerley. - Richard Cannerley. How do you do? - Charlotte Gray. So, going home or coming away? - I work in London. - Don't tell me, let me guess. - You're in the WAAFs? - I work in a surgery. Good for you. Why? - Risking London for the war effort. - It's our duty. Absolutely. I'm a civil servant. We don't come from anywhere. The Germans are spreading the rumor we're not born at all. You speak French? Oh, yes. Ever lived there? - I studied there. - In Paris? Best city in the world! Not that you'd want to live there now. It's full of Germans. Can't find anything but sauerkraut. What the Germans have done to France is not a joke. No. Of course not. Clear the doors! Each bag is to be collected by the exit! - Cheer up. We'll have a hoot. - You'll have a hoot. I'll be talking to some duffer about Tennyson. - It's just a book launch. - Books mean booze. You should be in publishing. Don't be such a stay-at-home. You never go out. I don't care if they're ugly, as long as they have nice teeth. The author. Excuse me. - Sorry. - Oh, no. - It's a bit noisy in there. - Yes. - Peter Gregory. - Charlotte Gray. Bloody hell! These literary girls... Sorry. Pilot Officer Borowski, Miss Gray. He's a friend. Delighted to meet you, Miss Gray. All clear. So... You're from Scotland? - Whereabouts? - Saint Andrews. Near Edinburgh, lovely. Bit different to this, eh? - You've never been to a ceilidh. - I have, actually. And yes, it was noisy. They don't serve warm gin either. I don't know how you drink it. - At least I don't water plants with it. - You weren't meant to see that. Miss Gray! I thought it was you. Good of you to come. How do you do? Let me introduce you to some chums. We're over in the corner. Morris, meet Miss Gray! She reads Stendhal in French. It's one thing to order dinner in the lingo. Quite another... ...to pass yourself off as a waiter. We're always looking for French speakers. War work of some kind. - Take me. - You'd never pass the physical. They're trained, but the truth is... ...you're either fluent or you're not. - I suppose. It's not easy pretending to be French. It's not just knowing the words. One's got to want to do it. One's got to feel strongly about what the Nazis have done to France. Excuse me. I did give you my number, didn't I? - Yes. - Do call, please. Bottoms up! To war. Hello again. Hello. Has that bloody airman been eating my rations again? And mine! Go on. That's terrible. You're not even trying. Punish me. I submit! The invasion plans are in my wooden leg. You're here. I think so. What would you say if I went to France? Why? Has someone asked you? What for? To be some sort of agent or courier, I think. - I'm not sure. - It's far too dangerous. - You fly. That's dangerous. - It's the only thing I'm good at. Do you mind? You didn't even say "ouch." You're brave. Be proud of it. - I'm just scared of you. - I want to be brave... ...like you are. Just be yourself. If I was myself, I'd never let you go. Do you believe in fate? I don't mean fate exactly, I mean... ...if someone tells you... If you have a gift, it's your duty to use it. To go out there. To... ...to be brave. - Charlotte... ...I'm not brave. It's just that... ...war makes us into people we didn't know we were. Look. I've lost all my friends. Every single one. Do you think I feel brave when I'm alive and they're dead? It's not bravery... ...it's accident. My leave is up. When? Tomorrow. It's just some ops over France. It's... How long? Three weeks. I'll be back in London on the 18th. You'll wait for me here. - War. - Peace. - War. - Flowers. France. Eyes closed, please. - France. - Love. - Love. - Key. - Lock. - Dark. - Death. - Old. Man. One word only. - Man. - Bald. - Man. - Bald. Sorry. Speed it up! Come on! Good! Small steps! Remember what your mother told you! Keep your knees and legs together! France, as you know, is currently divided into two zones. The northern zone, including Paris, is occupied by the Germans. The southern zone... ...or "free zone" is occupied and run by the French out of Vichy. By collaborating fully with the Third Reich... ...the Vichy government is allowed to police itself. And it's here in the free zone that the main Resistance is located. For those selected few who pass, this is where you will work. Once behind enemy lines, treat everyone with suspicion. The shopkeeper, the police, even colleagues in the Resistance. "Looking forward to our next meeting. Many thanks." As long as you are transmitting, the Hun can hear you... ...so save the bloody chitchat. Right foot! Again, right foot! Chest! Left shoulder! Right eye! The security implications are pretty simple. Should you be caught and tortured... ...yours, we sincerely trust, will be the only name they know. It follows that your greatest protection will be your cover. Soon, you'll transform yourself from who you are now... ... into somebody entirely different. Please, Mommy, I'm fine. If a bomb's got my name on it, a bomb's got my name on it. - I'm back. - I'm not leaving London. - Oh, Charlotte, hello. - Bye. - What's this course you've been on? - FANYs. First Aid... I know what they are. Are you a driver? Oh, I expect so, yes. So why do you need to go on a course? I'm not really supposed to say. You never know who's listening. Liar. You can't drive. Got me. - Pilot Officer Borowski? - Yes. - It's Miss Gray. We met at the party. - Oh, Miss Gray. Yes, I'm looking for Peter. I was expecting to see him last night. Oh, right. Peter, yes. Look, sorry. We think he went down over France. But don't give up hope. You know Peter, he's a fighter. We should know more in a few days. Can you call me back? Miss Gray, are you all right? Why is your name down for France? Only one in three come back. I want to help win the war. And being a courier in France is glamorous? - I'd be pretty silly to think that. - A lot of women do. Is there something wrong with that? Your father fought in the Great War, is that right? Would you say you're trying to impress him? Why should I? But your father introduced you to France. - Took you to visit the war graves? - Yes. - And your mother? - I don't see why... ...you're asking questions when you know the answers. Do you find it easy to form attachments? - On average. - Have you ever been in love? Yes, I have. Of these, which, in your view, is the most important: Faith, hope or love? Hope. On the double! Chop-chop! Look lively! Come on! Come on, now, girls! Last one eats a lemon! Come on, ladies! This is the finish line! - Miss Gray? I've got news of Peter. - You have? They made radio contact last night. Where was this? - I'm not really... - Please. I promise I won't say. All right, listen. It's a place called Gillesse. - Don't tell anyone I told... - I understand. - lf this got out... - No, I understand. - Thank you so much for telling me. - All right. Thank you. - Someone's coming. I've got to go. - All right. Identity card. Ration card. Certificate of non-belonging to the Jewish race. Husband's photo... ...and friends'. Lipstick. Sanitary towels, French. - Lighter. Fillings? - Done. Cigarettes. Favorite perfume. And no caf crme. They haven't had it for a year. Wedding ring. - Dominique. - Clear. For your English contact... ...Mirabel. - Mirabel. Cyanide pill. Come along. I've a handover for you. Some radio valves. Meet your contact at the Caf du Sport... ...Thursday morning, 10:00. She'll wear a blue coat and ask you how the weather is in Paris. Tell her it's not bad for the time of year. It's a bit English, I know, but it helps to remember. - You've done well. - Thank you. No, really. Main thing is, don't panic. It's just a test. To get you started. You'll hardly know you were gone. Always remember who you are not. From the moment you leave to the moment you're back... ... you are Dominique Guilbert from Paris. Can you believe it? They told me to get some sleep. You've come south seeking work while your husband is a POW. You have no children, no view on the Vichy government. You simply want to survive the war. From this moment on, Charlotte Gray is dead. What is it? Germans. Help! Mama! Come on, quick! Jacob, wait! - Drink? - Thank you. All right? Yes. - You missed the zone. - I saw lights. What lights? I was mistaken. Thank you. - You are? - Dominique Guilbert. Welcome to France, Dominique. - Octave! - Auguste! Idiot. - Take care. - Good night. - Don't forget this, Madame. - Thank you. Your papers? - You want one? - No. Thank you. You know this man? - He works with you? - He was on the plane. We're only told what we need to know. How much do they tell you about us? We're Communists. Did they tell you this? - No. - It bothers you. Why should it? You're all Gaullists in London. You send weapons because... ...south of Limoges, we're all you have. But after the war, you wait. - We're going to change things here. - Might be an idea to win first. This is the contact point. You ask for Octave. Otherwise... ...we don't know each other. - Fine. Thank you for coming. It is appreciated. Mama? Papa? Wait for me! - Do you think she was an angel? - Who? The lady from the sky. - I don't think so. - She could be, you don't know. They've been undermining us for years. Keeping the best jobs for themselves. The day they said no Jew should be a teacher was a special day for us. I didn't know the father was one of them. He seemed nice to me. No, he's seeing somebody else. I told her. Number, please. Connecting you. Order cakes from Madame Galliot, savories from Albert. Anything else could be horsemeat. Number, please. Connecting you. Boys? Shouldn't you be at school? - Where are your parents? - We don't know. - Morning, Madame. - Morning. The line's gone dead. I'm sorry, it's not my fault. No dawdling. Keep in line. Boys, wait! Please, after you, Madame. I know what you're up to, Batrice! Move! Madame. Coffee, please. You're not from around here? No. Paris. - How's the weather in Paris? - Not bad for the time of year. Don't give them to me. I'm being followed. Stay a moment, then leave. Wait! I don't have much time. - I have a friend in Gillesse. Do you..? - I don't know. Ask your C.O. I have to go. Excuse me, gentlemen, ladies. Your papers, please. Papers? Give them to me. Under the table. Quick! Move away. How's business? The cold doesn't help. - I'll be glad when it's summer. - You and the rest of us. Morning, Madame. Papers, please. Stand, please. Empty your pockets. What is this? A present. Open it, please. Sorry. Thank you. - What are these for? - A present for my brother. You are together? No. Follow me, please. No, she's leaving him for that teacher from Toulouse. I told you last week. Philippe. Connecting you. You know him. The Didier boy. The one with the lovely smile. Everything all right, monsieur? Oh, fine. Thank you, Sophie. - That wasn't good. - There's a woman. We must do something. I had a meeting with her and the police took her away! - See, there was an I.D. check... - Wait! One moment, please. - What woman? - It was a handover. - She needed valves. They searched her. - You'd given them to her? And? They asked her what they were for and took her away. - They didn't ask for you? - No. - What will they do with her? - Who saw you together? - The barman spoke to me. - He's all right. Anyone else? I don't know. It all happened very fast. - How was she caught? - They followed her. And she came into the caf? She was trying to warn me. That takes a second. We talked for a moment. She shouldn't have come in. - She was worried they'd try to stop me. - You don't... ...talk. - What will they do to her? - I don't know. Anyway, there's nothing we can do now. Why not go to your English contact? Because he hasn't shown up yet. - You have a code for meeting? - Yes! I'm sorry. I should go. No, no! Wait. You need a new cover. My father lives outside Lzignac, he rents rooms. If anyone asks, say you're a friend of mine from Paris. You're from Paris? Before the war, yes. Wait here an hour. I'll talk to my father. When you leave, ask directions for Le Domaine. Say you are the new housekeeper. Word spreads fast here. Two Jewish boys are there. Their parents are missing. You help. If I'm to stay with your father, shouldn't I know your real name? Julien. Excuse me. Monsieur. I'm Madame Guilbert. - Your son... - I know. He told me. I'm Levade. You can start by giving the boys a bath. They stink. Door's open. Hello? Hello? Mama? Shh! Hide! I'm Dominique. I work for Monsieur Levade. He asked me to give you a bath. So would you like me to? I'll wait outside. - She's the sky lady. I know it. - What's she doing here? Housework. What happened to your towels? We're going home! No, wait, please. You're soaked. Here. Dry yourselves. We're going home. Monsieur Levade isn't nice. - I don't like him either. - I'm sure he's... Where are our parents? I'm sure they wouldn't want you getting cold. Would they? Here you go. The boys are all right? They're in bed. They were asking about their mother. Have you found out what happened? They were arrested yesterday evening by our police. They've been taken to a holding camp in Drancy. The reason the boys weren't picked up is because they'd sneaked out. I have a contact there. He's working on their release. The mother must be going mad. - It was a mistake to bring them here. - You, with no room to spare. - No room good enough for you. - He's not used to visitors. - I have a choice? - Please, sit. - Sit! - Thank you. I know Monsieur Duguay. He lectured in Toulouse. I did some work for the university. They're good boys. - You want to eat? - No, thanks. Please yourself. It's rabbit stew. - Do you like rabbit stew? - Very nice. She likes it, and she hasn't even tried it. He thinks I cook like shit. If you hear from your contact, tell me. Of course. I'll say good night to the boys before I go. You may serve now. - Excuse me, am I on the right..? - Don't tell me your name. - I wasn't... - Twelve weeks of training. First thing they do is tell me their names. Let's get this done quickly. The Germans use the main line to transport munitions and vehicles. There's a train through Lzignac Monday, 1:30. Mainly wagons, bolsters for tanks and artillery pieces. Got that? Right. So I pass that on to Octave. Who do you think you pass it to? The gendarmerie? I was just... Sorry. I met a contact in town, code name Franoise. She's been taken away. - Do you know what's happened to her? - She's dead. Matter of fact, I liked her very much. She was unlucky. You weren't. Anyway, can't afford to get too close. Now! Go! Auguste, is Claire still mad enough to marry a blind man? My glasses are my best feature. - Don't be too proud. - Only from the neck up. Liar. - Time? - Two minutes. - Ready? - Just two seconds. Yes! Let's go! Down! - Guards firing! - Swine! - Grard, no! - Grard! Stay here! Come on! Move! Come on! Let's go! You go with him. Dominique, here. Drink? Thank you. What you've just done... Your hands. It's always a shock the first time. I tell Julien he'll die fighting the Germans. The old men, we remember. - You fought in... - I was an engineer. The war loves engineers. We mend dead machines. So Julien says you're from Paris. Your husband? He's a prisoner of war. In Bonn. Sorry. Why doesn't your son live with you? You don't get on? My son's a Communist. - And you? - I'm not interested in politics. Why fight? Why risk your life? For your country. Nobody fights for their country. Only for their family. For someone they love. Does it matter? Depends if you're on our side. I'm on your side. Yes. I think you are. Good morning, Madame. Good morning. Very pretty skirt, Madame. - We're waiting. - Yes, of course. Smile! One, two, three! Thank you. - Madame? - Gillesse, please. Two francs. Never leave the house without an adult. - We didn't know where you were. - Look, I'm sorry. You have to stay at the Domaine. All right? It's very important. Get down! You're dead! The longest throw wins! - All right. - I want to win! Line up! First is Jacob. Jacob, you're here. One! Aim high. Two! Three! Bravo! All right, Andr. One! Two! Three! Go! - Well done! - Yes! Come on. We'll go once more. Get mine as well. Come on. Got you! Got you, Jacob! Got you! - You've heard the news? - I saw them. What did Vichy expect? The Germans walk right through when it suits them. You should be proud. They need an army to fight you now. Thank you. - It's nice to see the boys laughing. - Yes. We must be careful. Do you have news of their parents? Nothing yet. These were my only clean clothes. - The boys seem well. - They do! - You'll contact... - When I have my next instructions. Good. You did well last night. I should be Essential Services. I had a company in Birmingham. Supplied parts for Ford. Fucking war! Do you have something for me? God, I hate this place. You have no idea. There's a drop coming. Tomorrow night. These are the reference points. Pass them on to your frogs. I know places that's a square meal. I need to... I need to ask a favor. - Ask. - I need to contact a colleague. I think he's hiding in a safe house in Gillesse. Your friend's name? What is it? Peter Gregory. - He's a pilot. His plane... - I'll make inquiries. - It's very important. - I said, I'd make inquiries. No! Don't! Leave me alone! - Go away! - You're all right. You're all right now. You're just dreaming. It's a dream. Jacob thinks you're an angel because you fell out of the sky. Is it true? No. - Is it all my fault? - What? - That Mama and Papa went away. - No. No, it's not your fault at all. It's the war. - Will they be all right? - Yes, they're going to be fine. Monsieur Foray, disappeared! Franoise Guilleme, disappeared! Philippe Le Gentil, disappeared! Jean Sauvier, disappeared! Martine Perrault, disappeared! Monsieur and Madame Duguay, disappeared! Claire Ribire, disappeared! - Julien! - Arnaud Lvy, disappeared! Robert Daladier, disappeared! Pierre Rouss, disappeared! Pierre Vallat, disappeared! Julien! We have to go! Shut up! Robert Daladier, disap... We have to go, do you understand? - We got news of the boys' parents. - Good? They've been moved to Poland. What..? To another work camp? I don't know. - I'm sorry you had to come out to me. - I work for your father. We're bound to know each other. - What'll we tell the boys? - Nothing, yet. I spoke to one of the gendarmes who took them away. He said he'd let the mother write a note, but... ...she took too long. He had to go. - The note was lost in the rush. - Oh, God. You spoke to your contact? - Yes. - And? - Drop's confirmed. - I'll meet you at the crossroads at 7. I found this pushed under the front door. For you. Thank you. - Good news? - Maybe. I don't know. I have to go out. Tell Julien, if he calls, I'll meet him. - I'll be as quick as I can. - Don't forget curfew! Papa, come on, quick. Bye, Mama. Shit! Shit! Bloody bike! Need to pee! Jesus! God, that is good! Oh, God, that is so good! His aircraft. What? - Where's Julien? - He should be here by now. Reverse L, quickly! Jean-Paul. Claire! On! His papers were found near the body. I shouldn't be here. I should be in Birmingham. This isn't me. A few days, you'll be home, love. You don't want to stay here. People are betraying their neighbors to the Gestapo for being too noisy. Nobody's ordinary now. I'll make contact before your plane comes. Don't go out unless you have to. Dominique, I'm hungry. Plates, please, Andr. - There's no jam. I want jam. - This isn't a hotel. - Mama always has jam. - I am not your bloody mama! Eat up! Come. - I shouldn't have frightened them. - They'll get over it. But what'll I say? How will they ever trust me again? They will. Children can forgive almost anything. - Well, why can't Julien forgive you? - Do you think he's so angry? It's just sad, the way the past holds on to you. My son's angry because I'm all he's got. His mother died when he was 3. I was a shitty father. Too interested in work. Girls. And now? I'm too old for self-deception. I am what I am. My only shame is, I lived long enough to see my country betray itself. Julien! Take the boys inside! Come, quick! - What are you doing? Let go! - You told them! You told the Germans we were coming! - I swear... - You told them! - I told no one! - Shut up! - Let go of me! - I wasn't even there to warn them. - I was late waiting for you to come. - I'm sorry. You know how many they shot? Auguste. Claire. All of them! There was nothing I could do! I couldn't call out. The Germans... I just watched! I just watched! I couldn't... Where were you? I had to report to my contact. I didn't have time to tell you. I swear I spoke to no one. The only person who knew the coordinates was you. I swear. Well, somebody told them. They knew the exact location. Which field, which road. They had map references down to the last tree. She's telling the truth. She was called away. I saw the note. She wouldn't do that. Face the wall. - These are your papers? - Yes. This card shows you crossed the demarcation line illegally last year. The stamp is wrong. In the car, please. As a teacher, I see everyone. Children, parents, grandparents. There's nobody I don't know. Here. We need to talk. Sorry. Outside. Where did the map references come from? Don't approach me in public. I'm keen on staying alive. They were leaked. - What are you talking about? - They were leaked. The Germans knew. We had no chance. It's nothing to do with me. I just say what I'm told to. - Then how did they find out? - Who knows? - Did you know what would happen? - Of course not! I just follow instructions. Whose instructions? London's? London knows everything. I'm only here for dodging import tax. My mother was French. It was this or the nick. My mistake. When did you first meet them? Did you approach them? They approached you, right? Right. Where was it? In a bar? On a train? Were you told to get me away from there? Were you? The Boches have come south to protect the coast. North Africa's a goner. They're losing. Everyone knows that. London, the French. Things change. We're not just fighting the Germans. You're saying they'd do all this to get six little Communists? You want to know who told the Germans? It could've been half a dozen people. An intercept. Someone in London. Maybe me. Maybe you. If I was in your position, I'd keep my knickers on and my trap shut. Are you gathering my gist? I think I understand you. Anyway, you're out of here. Wednesday, 0215. Same place you dropped in. Even you should remember that. You stay here, you're on your own. Could I help you? Forgive me. I'm Monsieur Renech. You're wondering why I'm here. You see... ...I've been watching you for some time. It's childish, I know. But you are a beautiful woman. What do you want? I felt it was my duty to warn you. - Warn me? - A man from Paris arrived yesterday... ...to help the Germans fulfill their Jewish quota. I was fortunate, as a senior figure in Lzignac... ...to meet with this man. He tells me that the Vichy government... ...has issued instructions on the deportation of Jewish children. - Why are you telling me this? - Your friend Julien... ...has the Duguay boys in the house. I heard them. - Who told you to come here? - No, please. Nobody knows I'm here. I came because... ...I want to be your friend. - I have to go. - No, wait! Please, Madame. Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn, please. No need for rudeness. I'm an important man. I speak to important people. So you will be my friend... ...and the boys will be safe. Kiss me. Tomorrow. I'm dirty down there. We'll be together tomorrow, when I'm clean. - lf you try to leave, I'll kill you. - Tomorrow. You will come. I know many people. You understand? Many people. I understand. - Is anyone following? - I don't think so. - We should have warned Julien. - They'll be watching him. - Ah, Madame. - Is everything all right? - Come on. - Out you get. Come. I have some little baby kittens. They were born two days ago! Bed's home! Got you! I've won. Dominique! I have to go. Listen carefully, both of you. I need you to stay here, in the attic. It's important not to go downstairs unless Madame Cariteau takes you. Do you understand? What about eating? Madame will give you your food, Monsieur Jam. I just need you to stay here. And try not to make too much noise. - Why can't you stay? - Yes, stay. It's safer this way, sweetheart. I'll be back tomorrow. No fighting. Could we stop a moment, please? Do you think it's possible for a person to commit a crime... ...without knowing it? - No. They can be part of it, but they can't be responsible. To be responsible, you must know what you do. Could you forgive yourself... ...if you'd been part of something terrible but didn't know? Yes, of course. Otherwise, what use am I to anyone? I don't think I know what I'm doing here anymore. - You moved the boys? - Yes. - They're safe? - For the moment. You want some soup? It's still warm. - Where's Dominique? - She went to rest. Thanks for watching the boys. It's not easy. All children are a pain in the ass. I knew that already. Eat. That's always your solution. To eat. Stay here tonight. You're tired. Who is it? Pichon. We are from the mairie. We'd like a word with you. Some gentlemen are here. Put chairs out in the dining room. Monsieur? I'm sorry about the dampness. We never use this room. Would you like something to drink? Sit down, monsieur. Monsieur Levade. My name is Paul Pichon. I work for the Inquiry and Control section of the Vichy government. - Very distinguished-sounding. - We've taken over some functions... ...of the police for Jewish affairs. Last month, our government carried out a census... ...of all known Jews in the free zone. Your name does not appear on it. Do you have a certificate of non-belonging to the Jewish race? - Why..? - Your papers, please. - Sorry? - Your documentation. Your identity card, ration card, work permit, if you please. - Everything? - Everything, please. Let me tell you something about collaboration. The aim of collaboration is, and always has been... ...to safeguard the independence of French citizens. It is our sincere belief that by cooperating with the occupier... ...we offer France the greatest chance of fulfilling her destiny. Indeed, I'd say there is no greater act of patriotism than to collaborate. - These papers aren't properly stamped. - I don't understand. All relevant papers must be stamped "Jew." - You know that! - I know nothing about these things. You didn't bring these people here about papers. Excuse me? And you are? - He's my... - I'm his son. Ah, yes, the son. Sit down. According to our records, M. Levade's heritage may not be entirely French. For this inquiry, we need to establish the origin of his grandparents. - They were French. - That's irrelevant! How is it irrelevant? He's French. I'm French. - How French are you? - Julien! He fought at Verdun. Four years in a trench. No one questioned him then. Monsieur, I may be of help if... Sure. Julien? A word with you? Julien! Get on with it. I know all about the Duguay boys. You've just moved them, haven't you? It's a teacher's business to know the whereabouts of his pupils. Is it not? So you see, we have a problem. Monsieur Pichon has to fulfill his quota. And to do so, he must either take your father... ...or the boys. Of course, he doesn't know that yet. It's up to you. Do you need a moment to think? I understand. You have something to say? His grandparents were Jewish. And if that makes my father a Jew... ...then I'm Jewish too. Actually, no. According to current regulations, you are only 1/8 Jewish... ...and therefore not a Jew. However, we do have certain matters to discuss with you. I'd be obliged if you'd stay in the house. The old man, please. Don't let him go like that. He needs clothes. Quickly. Monsieur, please. It's all right. I haven't forgotten. Here are your clean clothes. Julien. We need to get to the boys before Renech. - Julien, we have to get out of here! - What do you suggest? That I tell them I'm suddenly... ...feeling more Jewish than my father? - You did the only thing you could. - For what? For two boys that will probably die anyway. So do you suggest we give up? Why did you come here? For France, duty, I don't know. I felt... There was a man I loved. You joined up for him? Yes. - What happened? - He died. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Why should you be? Well, you loved him. We shouldn't talk like this. It's not safe. Your father, he's a good man. He'll understand you had no choice. No, he won't. Kiss me. Come closer. Hey! Unbutton my blouse. Hey! - Run! - At the church! Wake up. There's someone downstairs. Listen. There's nothing up there. No! There's nothing! Leave them alone. Leave them alone! You bastards! Leave them alone! No! - Andr! Jacob! - Dominique! I'll find you! - See you soon. - Yes, indeed, I hope so. Thank you. Good evening, little ones. My humble abode. Would you care for a nightcap? Thank you. - Such a pretty part of town. - A little rickety, but I like it. Wait. I was too late. They're being taken away by train. That was all I could find out. For God's sake, say something! - We have to leave. - No! Dominique. Renech's dead. I was seen. There's nothing more to do. - I'm not leaving. - Think. They'll kill you. You want that? No? Then leave with me. We have a driver to take us to Toulouse. Then, the Pyrenees. - Dominique... - I am not leaving. Listen to me. If you stay now, you'll die. And before you die, they'll torture you. Then you'll talk. - You think that will help us to win? - How can you say that to me? - What, you want to kill yourself? - No. Why? You can't stand to be alive when others are condemned to death? You think it doesn't hurt to see my father taken? To know I can't help him or say sorry to him? You think that does not hurt? There's nothing I can do. That's the truth now. Except survive! That's how it is. It's not enough! - Dominique. - It can't be enough. - You did your best! - Don't say that! My best? How dare you say that to me? You don't know what I've done. You don't know who I am. You don't even know my name. Yes! I have to do something. There must be something to set against all this. You have to go. I'm sorry. I'll be all right. I'll use my contact. Please, go! Now, for your father's sake. Go! Go! Police! Open up! Open up! Check upstairs. Yes? Nothing. Monsieur, please. Hey, no baggage. Andr! Jacob! Andr! Jacob! Jacob! Duguay? - Dominique! - Dominique! Jacob! Dominique! - Andr! - In here! Monsieur Levade. Monsieur Levade! Here. I have a letter. From the boys' mother. Take it! "My dearest little ones: I hope that someone is reading you this letter. Papa and I are fine and well. I'm sorry I was not able to say goodbye or write to you earlier... ...but we had to leave so quickly, and I've been working hard ever since. We are doing war work in Germany. When it's all over, we will return. But in the meantime, you must be strong and look after each other. Eat well, as well as you can. Even if sometimes you don't feel like it. Try not to squabble. And if you go out anywhere, I want you always to hold hands. Like you do when you cross the road. We embrace you with all our hearts. Your loving Mama and Papa." He was killed in North Africa... If you go through there... ...you'll see the lady from the Red Cross. Thank you. Next? - Mrs. Baxter, how many dependents? - Three. Four. Now, see that chap in Housing? - He'll fix you up with something. - Thank you, miss. You coming to the pictures? It's I Walked With a Zombie. No, thanks. - Tom Conway's in it. - I'll get an early night. Suit yourself. This came for you this morning. - You all right? You look peaky to me. - Daisy. I've gone, I've gone. Have fun. You got my letter? Yes, of course you did. I'm sorry to spring it on you. It was a bit tricky getting away. How long have you been in England? A couple of months. I wasn't too good when I got back. They... ...told me you were dead. - I thought I was. No, they showed me photos. There was a body. It was the navigator. I was kept hidden. They couldn't move me. I was going crazy. - You all right? - Yes. I'm sorry, I just... I can't quite... It's good you got back. What about you? What happened to you? I went to France. See, you never could persuade me not to go. Why did you? I think I thought I could find you. - Oh, Peter. - What happened? - Charlotte? - You were right about war. It makes fools of us all. The rest, it kills. Takes everyone time to recover. The whole thing is such a bloody mess. You know... ...I never stopped thinking about you. We could go away somewhere. Anywhere. - Peter. - I'm due leave, we... I can't go back. I'm sorry. I wish you'd listened. Then I wouldn't have been myself. Hello. Hello. I didn't think... No. There's something I've been meaning to tell you. What? My name... ...is Charlotte Gray.
