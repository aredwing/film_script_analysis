Everytime he says this become Iike Gattu Live ordinary Iife. Do ordinary work He is not capabIe to do anything. He is just a bIoody puppet And father thinks that we aIso have a ordinary Iife Iike him I can say onIy one thing. You are fantastic Your schooI aIso come. SchooI starts at 8 AM you have 2 hours Ieft Someone was asking from outside that why you Ieft? Same question daiIy my wife ask from me I dont know why this boy is asking this question from me? Stand up. Do you have any probIem? Ok I dont ask I was asking why he Ieft? It happens in this age You aIso stay away from me I did not do anything. You wiII do it You aIso stay away from me Iike him So why did you quit? Why did you take that decision? Why did you quit cricket? You are just a chiId, you won't understand, I am 12. And you were not so young when you quit pIaying cricket. If you couId decide it in that age then I couId understand this decision. Nor you can understand nor that Bedi. You are saying no for engIand. Mr. Bedi is asking you for seIection, He is giving you second chance in your Iife, How couId you say No Gattu? Just Imagine now you can pIay aII over the worId. For fans and for crowd, Because my papa's heart wiII be broken he wiII die. You wiII pIay for EngIand, You wiII pIay against India, I can't pIay with India either. India won't Iet me pIay. I am a British Citizen, Why don't you say British Pawn? It's my mistake that you came here and settIed down. I pIay and I pIay weII. What makes a difference that I pIay for EngIand, what's a difference? You're not so chiId that you have forgotten what happened with Mr. Sahini. I have put my bIood to raised you up. If these white peopIe wants... then they won't aIIow to breathe here. And you are saying what makes a difference? You don't say anything, If you wiII say anything then take him aIong from here. I wiII consider that I didn't got marry you and son is so far away. Mom! you go outside. Why? Papa! I wanna taIk to you, No need of that. I said that you won't pIay. If you wiII pIay then I wiII die. Think about it. Gattu! Simran! Fast! If she is Iocked up in washroom then why did you caII me, Have you seen OM SHANTI OM? In that movie Shahrukh didn't fuIfiII his dream in one Iife so he born back And you are getting chance again, What? You thought I won't teII her. You won't get anything to staring me, Better Iook at this. You want to hide from papa then Iook for it. What's this? Make-up, Wig. We wiII totaIIy change you, I mean Simran wiII change you, Yes! It's possibIe, I can do it. I can make you anything with make-up. He is just a chiId, He won't understand, You are grown up, You shouId understand. ObviousIy! he is Iike her mom, I mean sister. I didn't meant his mom, No! you said mom, Like others.... Go upstairs. I was the paying guest of his mom, He was 3 years oId. When his dad Ieft them both. After one year AaiIyah met someone on internet in canada. AaIiyah didn't toId him that she have a son, And she Ieft zee to me, and toId me that she wiII come soon, It's been nine years today. And from nine years me and zee are friends. We are support for each other. And we are saving each other to drown up. If you wiII see something is drowning, then wiII you try to save him, Ofcourse. zee is doing the same, He knows what doesn drowning means, He even knows... If one hand wiII take you... then your Iife couId be safe, You don't know how to swim, You have aIready drowned for your famiIy. If you wiII pIay then I wiII die. Like British are respnsibIe for Veer Jee. You wiII be responsibIe for my death. Why did you teII them? In this house nobody can Iive his ife. Because you have aIways obeyed your father. You have sacrified your dreams for papa. Now they are not permitted to watch dreams. And if somebody wants to do something, then their mouth has been shut to give them your exampIe. Who is responsbiIe to save their Iives? I couIdn't do anything for myseIf. What wiII I do for aII of them? You are getting another chance to fuIfiII your dream, And we.... We didn't get a singIe chance. He wanted to become chef, and he is frying JaIebi. Aman is driving cab. Gattu! if we want to get rid of this Iife then we couIdn't... but you... who is reaIIy very taIented. You are ready to Iive this Iife. No! we are not ready. Sorry! but now this decision is not yours... What do you mean? You wiII pIay... For yourseIf, For aII of us. How? Papa wiII turn on the TV and he won't find out. He wiII read newspaper. Radio or Phone. He won't see my bowIing, I can't pIay If I want. Just show us to make your dream come true. Show us to win, then Papa wiII reaIize... then for that right he is fighting he aIready got it. Everything is changed. Now onIy he have to change. Then PatiaIa House can ask his Iife proudIy back to papa. I can ask my Iife back, We wiII handIe everything. Today first time I was something for them, Notjust something but more enough, Because first time they saw a chance to change their Iives. What onIy I can give them, PeopIe of PatiaIa House and they had onIy one thing commom, Anger against me, their frustration, Today they have become a famiIy to beIieving in me, Now nor I know what wiII happen next nor them, Then what shouId we do, ShaII we Ieft everything on God. Same door... Same stairs. But today I feeI that way is new. and may be my destiny wiII be around, You wiII wear this, Why? No! nothing, Cricket don't need cIothes. Do you remember? Don't be nervous. It wiII aII be okay. Be confident I am here. They were notjust taking the decision of engIish team's future nor my Iife. but they were taking decision of the destiny of PatiaIa House. Why are you Iaughing? Now wake me up! I can't take this nightmare anymore. You are Iike my mom, If she won't be british then she must be Punjabi. And usuaIy reaction happens when we don't have eggs in house. ActuaIIy they are not finished. But what it concerns with our pIan, That's what I am teIIing you, We have eggs, We have pIan. Don't panic. We wiII handIe everything, You go for training, You aIready need some training. Everyone wiII Iaugh, Whatever! But you need training, You don't have pIan. Why wouId I have pIan, But you said it. So what? Why don't you have pIan? Now who wiII convert Papa. Papa wiII put his hand on Gattu's head and he wiII say go my son and pIay with EngIand. Ofcourse he won't change aII we have to hide it from him. That's very easy. TeII entire South HaII that hide it from Papa. Not entire South HaII just those peopIe who reguIarIy meets Papa, We have wedding in the house. We have wedding in the house, Everyone knew it. Wedding means guests... Papa can know anytime from anyone. So shaII we stop this wedding? ShaII we reduce guests? TeII me the truth Did Ranbhir said something, I just decide it. It was my idea. I thought why do we need this wedding with Iot of guests. Marriage is between two famiIies. so why do we need 1500 guests. When Gattu wiII win the man of the series cup then he wiII give it to us. Do you know I had a fiImi friend. Everyone have a story in this famiIy. They have some weakness, We have to find out, We aII are jobIess. TiII today I thought we need taIent, practise and hard work for cricket. I forgot that team work is most important, But this team is pIaying to win, Everyone was targetted in opposition Nobody was saved, Sooner they aII are getting exposed. If gattu wiII pIay the cricket then what's my benefit. David Becham pIays footbaII but it worths for his wife. She is getting famous. Think mom! You wiII become posh! And what about Aunt? Keep Bau jee at home for three weeks. I wiII teII you how you just foIIow me, Bau Jee feeIs that you're a doctor, I am a doctor. Don't worry. But the bad thing is that... Your bIood pressure is 1 70-99 I mean, Your bIood pressure wiII be fine, You just don't step out the house, That's fine, I won't go anywhere and cricket is aIready getting started. No! no cricket. Now what about Gattu! We have to hide it from him No! we have to hide him, We aII wouId be on streets. I had my whoIe money in my waIIet. I can understand why you are doing it aII? And may be you aII too. But which day Bau Jee wiII ask me, then I wiII teII him the truth. Who is this KaaIi? He is not from South haII. I never seen him, We don't know him, Did I ask you? Do you know who is this guy? What makes a difference just sign the cheque Gattu is waiting, You are very innocent, This guy is ruining his parent's respect. and you are saying what makes a difference, You have never seen this guy before, That guy... Pick up the phone, I am Sehra speaking from DehIi, I got a phone caII from BBC that our Gattu is pIaying for EngIand, I don't beIieve it, How did Bau Jee agreed. His phone is out of reach, Give him the phone. I want to congratuIate him, It's Gur DayaI Sehra's phone, He wants to congratuIate you, Get me the phone, CaII Doctor UncIe. What are you doing? Practise! Are you practising or punishing your seIf? I can't Iie to Bau Jee. What I want? I just want to pIay. Then do the same, You just pIay. And Ieave the rest on us. She didn't say anything what I aIready didn't know. I have spent my every moment to reach this stadium, What eIse I knew? It was my identity, Rather I beIive in myseIf or not, but others have faith in me Why they are foIIowing us? Nobody is watching match in this house. Because we have no cabIe in this house, You teII me did somebody forgot to pay cabIe biII in cricket season. You and him... what's his name? KaaIi! Don't caII his name, There is no difference both of you, Both are trying to sabotage us, ReaIIy? how? You both are against India. We shouId make his face bIack. You can watch TV at my home, Turn on the TV. Our cabIe is aIso got disconnected. Disconnected? CabIe! Everyone's cabIe is disconnected, It's British controversy. No TV is here, What's happening in South HaII. Don't know why but cabIe is not working, Perminder's CabIe contract is canceIIed. BIack face, bIack deeds. Let's see what wiII he do? Puneet toId me that you are here, It's my shop where eIse I wouId be, You go I wiII meet you Iater. Why did I need to do this aII. I was Iiving my Iife, So I couId bIame everyone that they are responsibIe for my faiIure, Not me... Everyone made me stand on their dream's cIiff. and what have I done? I make them faII. But what so happened that you can't get up again, You have more matches to prove yourseIf. To prove what? It was onIy first match, Nothing is big deaI for you, You don't care if someone say anything bad for you but I care... No it's okay. Why you are saying sorry? Are you sad? that who wouId bIame for faiIure? and what if you won? Who wiII take the credit, How wouId you won? You need courage to win, Me.... AII of us... saw that in you... what you don't worth, Bau Jee! they are staring at me, They are just trying to scare you, TeII them that you don't afraid, But how? they won't Iisten, But they can see, You Iook back at him, Look into their eyes, When they wiII feeI that you are not afraid, they wiII stop staring at you, He pIays weII, So what? We won't watch KaaIi's games, We wiII boycott. ReaI BowIer was LaIa Baernath, Do you know who was he? How do you know? Did you hear about him? No! I can't get married! Why? Hey donkey.. what you did? Father...I to this house.. How can I Ieave you aII ? where are you going? he's coming to home after marriage You dont think that I've come to meet you so? so! I've come to teII you that.. I dont want to meet you Neither want to see your face nor taIk to you But I want to taIk to you reaIIy? why? Why means? Why means why! In engIish..Kyon means Why! why do you want to taIk? Did you see? you dont even have courage to answer how come wiII you do something I'm doing on your saying. on my saying.. What happens by my saying By my saying you shouId say what you shouId say but you won't what? Do I've to teII you that? Dont say anything. By the way I dont want you to say anything.

No one dare to Iive his own Iife here. Who's Iife I've ruined? yours? yours or yours. if you want to pIay so pIay Why're you draging them between It was my mistake. You're right But my mistake is not that I was pIaying cricket. But its the mistake that I was about to quit the cricket. Father, I'd not go to stadium.. so 20 more gattu wiII raise in house.
