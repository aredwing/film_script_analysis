We need a dozen of colleagues for tomorrow's Police Report shooting. The 'post-compliant trauma' peer group is taking in newbies. Don't forget the 'Star of the Month' birthday party this afternoon, there will be cakes and lucky draw in the common room. "Johnny Li" Squat, you little perv! Hi there miss, police. Hi, Sir Did he just molest you? Your ID card please. What's your name, miss? What? ID card? No, I mean your English name. Sounds much friendlier, right? I am Candy. Right, Candy, thanks. Give me your number too. Don't get me wrong, I just want to follow up your case and keep you posted. There are a lot of people around, don't want you to feel awkward, you know. All right. Thanks, sir. Just Fei will do. Fei. Darling. Johnny. What? Are we following up cases? Of course not. Just gossiping. Have you ordered that COMME des GARSONS cross-over -outfit for me yet? - Oh wait, I will be a bridesmaid next Sat. You need to pick a dress for me. Hey, hold on. You promised to write the report to Madam Chu for me. But is Madam Chu back yet? She was desperately looking for you... ...first thing she got back. Good on you, having a godmother at work. No need to work away from office. All you need is to be her personal assistant. Getting her coffee and tending to her kid, So chilled. Thanks, Fei. Bye. Take care. Stand up, you perv. Sir... What? So used to getting caught, huh? You are really taking snapshots of women panties. So many of them, you son of a bitch, And even this? Such bad taste. No, sir. The exams are stressing me out. - Give me a chance... - A chance? Tell you what, you won't get away with this even you are a first offender. You'll make it to the headlines for sure. When you are behind bars, look at you, I am sure you'll get rammed every night. Sir, please give me a chance. Madam. BOY- These flowers are from Chief Lam. You went shopping today? Nah, these need some washing. This one needs softener. Make sure you wrap this up after washing and pop in some desiccants. - And these need dry cleaning. - Fine. Then go pick my son up at school, and take him to the piano class. Then get a three-pound cake, some paper cups and plates too. We are having the 'Star of the Month' birthday party today. Yes, madam Hurry UP- There are a lot of reports waiting for you. Yes, madam. I am now giving you a chance. You see, there is an old case and this bloke at the Ocean Park did something really filthy in front of the pandas. That scared the shit out of Ying Ying and Le Le. If you plead guilty for a small case like this, they will only sentence you to community service. It is no big deal cleaning up for the pandas, right? If you are willing to do this, I can pretend I have seen nothing just now. - Sir, - What do you think? I am a nerd but don't you fool me. So you don't trust me? Hands down and make no waves, - Doubting me, are you? - No, no, I... That's right, come to the police station with me. This way everyone! Sir, sir. We have a new housing estate for sale. 80% net floor area. Nothing comes up on the "sand track". "Informant Lau Jing:" "Tip-off, the wanted 'credit card Chiu"' "is appearing at Tsim Sha Tsui East." "Also, lend me a quick ten grand." "Horse owner" is entering "sand track". "Horse owner" is entering "sand track". Attention everyone, Take no action until all "horse owners" arrive. Brother Chiu, it looks kinda busy today. Someone is approaching, someone is approaching. Damn it, who on earth is that guy? Got it, I will intercept him. Aren't you "credit card Chiu"? Hold on, hold on. Now what? Cash strapped again? Hey, look at me. Aren't they... Police, squat down! Damn Take action everyone. Go, go, go! Go away. Go away. Bugger off. Go away. Go away, go away- Out of my way. They are running towards Chatham road. Block the roads and intercept them. This is police, go away. One by one... Out of my way. Come on, move... Go away. Be careful. Be careful. Quick. Bastard, -you are running over a police officer! - Sorry! Sorry, sorry... Tough luck, I am taking over your car, get out. Hey, stop! I am commanding you to get out. No way. You are in my way, move your arse. Hey, I am police too. Are you kidding me? Use the opposite lane. Whoa, we are crashing! Go away. Go away, go away- Slow down. The cake, the cake. Slow down. Go away. Go away. Hey, don't you know you can't drive here? Be careful! Shut up. Go away. Sor . . my, sorry. Be careful, there are many people around. Get out of my way! Sorry, sorry. Go away. Be careful not to run over them. This is my car. Bro, that car is tailing us. Oh, we are going to crash. Be careful. Bugger off. We are finished. We...are...doomed! What are you guys doing? Are you two security guards? Don't bother, you can't open it. Our department has shut down. What? Shut down? This is the bill for what you have wrecked today, plus stuff you have crashed before, there is no way you can retire before age 80. It is already bad enough to knock down lamp posts and traffic lights, and now you have crashed into those race cars. That's a jackpot. A gigantic bill. What department would pay it up? The C.l.D. is moving to a new office and they are saying that the new office is too small to fit us in. Then what do we do now? Guess we have to come up with ways. Perhaps giving YOU UP? Have you watched The Titanic? It's better to have only one person jumping into the sea instead of us all drowning. Look at us two, do we look like we can swim? Oh, that's a tough one for you. That's no big deal, we are colleagues after all, aren't we? Well then, before hopping off, guess I'll have a chat with the Complaints Council and the Ombudsman. Just to let them know your cruise trips to Macau and the expensive wines from your rich friends, also the illegal basement at your country house. Don't sleep talk in broad daylight. Forget about it. We'll forgive you and don't worry about these, I'll handle them. It is the government's money after all. Where are we going then? Aha, we are merging with the C.N.D. Let's have a cross over! What's C.N.D.? C.N.D. stands for Central New Department. A new section with no actual purpose. Composed entirely of unwanted staff the management can't get rid of. Their main duties include issuing tickets, marking parking lots, ordering pepper sprays, organizing social events, providing extras for the Police Report program and closing old cases, etc. Are you ready? Welcome Man Sir! Man Sir, It's my pleasure to be your colleague Thanks, though it's a little over the top. No, not at all. Your packages have arrived. - I'll show you your room. - Great, thanks. It is designed after your old office. This is PC Buddy, designed by the girls. It has better ratings online than the Chief Executive. That's impressive. Well, I need to have a few words with you. Good, whoa, just like the old office. Right, we all stick to your work philosophy: get nothing done and stay away from trouble But you aren't supposed to bring Fei with you, right? No department is willing to take him in You see, our department is the heaven and paradise of the Police Force. That guy out there pissed off the organized crime bureau. He also crashed my godson's car. I don't want to see him around. I can ask him to stay away from the office, and I won't arrange a desk for him. How about that? Chau Sir, I have nowhere to sit. Chau Sir, Chau Sir. Hey, Chau Sir, I have nowhere to sit. Chau Sir, hey, hey. Okay, fine. Damn, why are you working as a cop? Go work in cosmetics. Let me give you a piece of advice. A cop should never drive a family car like yours. It never goes over 70km/h. How do you catch thieves anyway? You better-off riding a bicycle. My car is still with the garage, and I'll hand you the bill later. Hey, you have got such a spacious desk. That's none of your business. What's your name anyway? I am Chan Kin-fei, and you? I am Johnny... Right, Johnny, Madam Chu just asked me to sit next to you, so that I can learn from you. There is no way she would say that. Why not? Go ask her if you want to. Smart-arse. This should go here... and this should go there... and this one... What are you doing? Don't touch my stuff. Give me my seat. That's my seat, give it back to me. Hell no. (ring tone:good boy, good boy...) (pick up the phone...) - Hello. - Hello. - Mum. - Dad. Several days ago, while a group of Hong Kong tourists were on their way to the scenic spot, the driver suffered from a sudden heart attack. Their coach shook violently from side to side and a passenger saved the day by promptly stopping the coach. The Coach was full of tourists from Hong Kong Luckily there is someone Controlled the bus and saved everyone. Just like a scene out of movies. We are going to meet with this hero real soon. We have heard that it is even more romantic than films. Why are you here at the airport? Why not? You don't own it, do you? What's wrong is with you? I am warning you, I am here to pick up my mum. Don't you stalk me. I am warning you, I'll beat up your mum. If you don't shut up. Such a retard. Mr Chan. What does it feel to save everyone on the coach? Please share your thoughts. Were you a policeman? Just a few words will do. There is not much I can say. - Johnny. - Mum, are you okay? - Son. - Mum, - I miss you. - Miss you heaps. Let me take a good look at you. Such a handsome lad. - Who is he? - My son. We have been relying on each other for over 20 years. Okay, all right. Son, give me a hand with the luggage, will you? Share a few words with us please. I think this has really opened my eyes. Things often take the wrong turn, and go out of your control. So if you have anything you want to do, you need to go for it right away. Just like me and Philip, although we have just met each other, after going through this, we have decided to get married after returning to Hong Kong. What? Congratulations Will you hold a wedding dinner, any idea? We have not decided yet Let's go. This is the breaking news I mentioned earlier. Things took a romantic turn after the accident. Giu and Philip the hero have decided to get a flash marriage. Wait, what? Give you a call when I get home. Mum, what's this? You have just met him, and I don't know him either. Why marrying him? Are you nuts? You two are not getting any younger, flash marriage? Calm down. It is better to have someone to take care of us two. Come on, take it easy. He is a good chap and he saved my life too. Am I not taking good care of you? I really can't stand his son. I am afraid that I could kill him. What if he is only marrying for your money? Hey I am warning you, don't you screw this up for me, otherwise you are doomed. What do you mean? Are you saying I am not in good shape? Why would he want my money? Let's go home. Pick up the luggage- How did a lame duck like you manage to become an officer? Even the cardboard police looks tougher than you. Did your mum get this outfit for you? Something wrong with your fashion taste? This is called the preppy look, what's your problem? What look again? Geeky look? Why can't cops dress decently? I am setting an example for everyone... for everyone to laugh at, huh? I don't care how retarded you are But don't you call me brother at work, or I'll beat the hell out of you Congrats! All's well that ends well. Love each other. You... What is their relationship? They both got a new parent. What should we call them then? They are brothers, but are not related. Then you two must be... Eskimo brothers! You are finally here. Aww...so sweet! You two are brothers now. Come on, cuddle... and kiss. Not bad at all. Congrats! You got a new brother. Also a new mum too. Be a good son from now on. So you are now... the little bro! Love each other and don't fight over toys! Our last meet-up wasn't that long ago. Out of cash again? Cut that out. Go order some drinks. Your treat? Guess I'll order everything from the menu then. Ah Hung, go take his order. A beer, and some pricy nibbles to go with the drinks... How about truffle on toast, and a foie gras pork chop bun? Okay- Ah Hung, ring the bell, will you? - This round is on me. - All right. - Round 1 - A free round for everyone! Don't mention it. Nice watch, you are doing quite well, aren't you? Limited edition. Whoa, limited edition? Ten grand, twenty grand. What are you doing? You lend me ten thousand last time, right? Now this is twenty grand. You have done well for yourself, huh? Keep that for yourself. You never know when you'll need it. I don't have to scrape along anymore. I have got myself a good opportunity. Ever heard of Hung Cheung-hing? That's who I am working for. He thinks I would go far. Okay, okay. Why is he hiring you anyway? You know nothing but picking out fights. Mr Hung is running so many businesses. There is always something I can do, learn as you go, YOU know? All right, okay. Thanks. Make sure you look after me when you get rich. Guess I can quit my job now. What's wrong with your job? We all wanted to be a cop when we were young. That's everyone's dream. But none of us actually made it. Hey, do you remember. I got beaten up when I was a teenager. Then you taught that guy a lesson for me. He was so roughed up and could hardly stand up. The police arrested you. You shouldered all the responsibility to keep me from trouble. How else could I become a cop without you? I would have become a gangster. If you were caught then, you would be my big brother. No way! Forget it! Be a good cop. Get promoted quick. And I will be the informant for the police chief. The exclusive one. Whoa, exclusive. The chief's mole, right? Cheers! So that's it. Meanwhile I'll earn some quick bucks with Mr Hung, and move to Vanuatu afterwards. Where all women are topless? Topless! Just think about it, where in Hong Kong can you run around bare-assed? How dare you embezzling funds? Please tell Mr Hung I was broke, I really need the money! I am sorry. I'll never do that again! Go! Chan Kin-fei, back to the station with me. We suspect that you are involved in Lau Jing's murder. Get up and follow me. What station? My bro is dead, what's the point of going with you? This is your bro? Well then, I suspect that you are associated with the triads. Go with me. I need to see my superior. This has nothing to do with your department. There is no one who can cover you up. I tell you what, you've been screwing up my plans over and over again. You are definitely getting a suspension from me this time. Let's see. Chow Sir, Chow Sir. I work under Man Sir. Don't you see I am working? Piss off. Hey, take it easy. Just want to have a word with my colleague. - Make it quick. - Ok, thanks. What are you doing here? Where is Man Sir? You are in big trouble. Man Sir is sorting this out for you. He wanted me to tell you, it is okay to have a drink with a gangster. Even if he dies after a drink or two, that's no big deal either. If they are questioning you, just say Lau is your informant. That's why you two are meeting up. They can do nothing about it. You have Man Sir's and my full support on this one, even if it is going to cost us a demotion. Bro, Chow Sir, Chow Sir. Man Sir wanted to tell you, he is on our side. Just do a quick round of questions and let him go, okay? - Thanks. - We'll see. But this guy is very stubborn. You need to put the screws on him, if you want anything from him. You think I can't hear you? Stop this nonsense, will you? This is my department's matter. None of your business. Still going or not? Make it quick. - Let's go. - Don't you touch me! Just go. Running a little late. My bad, my bad. Welcome, Mr Hung. Hello, hello... - Here? - Yes, please. Take a seat. Hi, Mr Hung. Let me put this on for you. Wait, look at this flower, It looks as gross as you are. How can I wear this? No thanks. Thanks. They are out of budget or what? Actually, Mr Hung. I have spoken to them just now. But the government is like that, they think that looks nice. I'll speak to them again. Don't worry about that. - Hi, chairman! - Good to see you Mr Hung. Welcome, take a seat. When you asked me to donate 8 million, it took me only two seconds to say yes. - Yes, thank you for your support... - Don't mention it. Where did you get these flowers from? Funeral homes? Also, this event is sponsored by my personal charitable foundation. How come it shows up as Hung's Group? The Group is now a listed company! I'll follow it up right away. What's the point of following up? Follow up...follow up... I am now telling you, when I present the cheque on stage you must say, thank you Mr Hung Cheung-hing, loud and clear. Yes...yes. Of course. Loud and clear, you hear me? Okay, thanks. Thanks, Mr Hung. - Fei - Put it on for me. This flower is pretty. What a coincidence. It has been a long time. Wasn't that long ago. You look great. Every girlfriend you dumped is now happy and successful. I am now the vice president of Hung's PR department. Why are you here? Work. - Let's invite our guest, - I won't keep you then. Mr Hung to the stage. We are going to do a cheque presentation Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you Mr Hung. The whole point of setting up my very own charitable foundation, is to "address people's pressing needs" and "think what people think." I am going to set up a private foundation in the near future. If you want to go into politics and be rich and successful, just give me a call, okay? Rumors said that the fund is earn from doing business with mafia Is that true? Please comment on that Did you company have any business to do with the mafia? Listen to me. Listen, listen, listen... I really want to listen to you all. But all your questions make no sense to me. Thank you very much. Mr Hung, Police. You had an employee called Lau Jing. Do you know him? I have so many people working for me. I have a Wong Jing and a Ng Jing, but I don't recall a Lau Jing. Lau told me he works for you. He was shot dead last night. To be honest, some people just deserve that. Take it easy. But don't worry, I'll be the title sponsor of his funeral. I want to ask you What did he do at your company? Where did you go and what have you done last night? I was at my friend's funeral all night. Mr Hung. Are you assaulting Police? - What? - Take it easy. That's nothing, just a small fry, right? Fei, are you okay? What? I am fine. Fei Mr Chan, we have moved all your furniture over. Please sign here. Cheers. Hey, Why don't you get off? I am not getting off. I am warning you, there is no way I am calling her mum. I will curse at you if you force me to. What's wrong is with you? You are not a kid anymore, I can't force you to call her mum. Yes, exactly, I am not a kid anymore. So why are you forcing me to live with you two then? What can I do? You can't get hold of a Police dorm. And my lease contract is up. Tell me what can I do? You know what, you either go up -or you move out. - Honey, honey. Honey, hello. Come here, Quick, Johnny. Say uncle. Mr Chan. Haha, save that. Why so tense? Don't worry, you will get the hang of it next time. Shall we go up to see your room? Hey, get off that car. That's Fei. Sorry, Fei. I have got only two rooms here. You two have to share a room for now. How about that? I'll see if we can make a partition in a few days time. No, don't worry about that. This is the perfect room for two. Well, that's good. Come here. Hey, you didn't mention this to me beforehand. That's no big deal. Just imagine you are still at the academy. Sleeping next to your buddies. You guys can chit chat too, isn't that awesome? Okay, we haven't had a good chat for over 10 years. How about I sleep next to you and chat through the night? Don't mess around. This is my first night here. I have not...em...for over 20 years. Do me a favour, don't mess up. Please... Okay, that's fine. They can share the room. Your pills are with me. How do you make out? Go have a chat with him. It is late. Let's go to bed. Come on. Aww, mummy's boy Oh, you have to do that later. Good night. Dad, dad. You just saw it. Give your best shot tonight. Don't leave her unsatisfied. Know what I mean? Cut that crap. Dad, Go, go, go! What? Nothing is on TV, why are you weeping? I have hidden the pills away. That's impressive. Your mum is crying out loud. That's my mum! Maybe it is not dad who is gaining the upper hand. It sounds like your mum is in control. Oh, shut that. - How's that? - Oh, that's great. Would have been greater if I have my pills with me. Hey, hey- I'm asleep, I hear nothing. To be frank, your mum is in good shape. She looks kinda young. Teddy. . .teddy... Let me tell you, Dad and I have long wanted to kick your master out. We have a plan. We'll put up with this lame duck for now. Once dad has settled down with his mum, I will play her against your master. We'll ask her to change the will and snatch the house from him. Then kick this guy out and sell him off to Bangladesh to do go-go dance. What do you think? Didn't I tell you, they will be fine? Fine? It is not going to be fine. No way! Why? I am not boasting, but my son has always been gentle. He never gets into fights. Oh man, this girl is hot. How can they come up with positions like this? No...no... You hear that sound? All the yelling It's coming up now. Really? Take off her panty! Stop watching porn at the middle of the night. This is disgusting. Don't throw your stuff at me. You are disgusting. Underpants? Shit...shit...shit. Stop yelling. I only wiped my mouth with that. Don't worry. Dude. You have ruined my special collection! Hey, don't touch my Jeremy Lin. Why can't I touch your stuff? But you can? What are you two doing? He ruined my collection. Darling, what can we do? This is only the first night. We are doomed. Stop fighting- What? Monitoring him? You two are brothers. You are always with him anyway. Even I didn't tell you. I have got a complaint from the Complaints Council They said you harassed Mr Hung. Did he speak to the Security Bureau or what? Of course not. He spoke directly to the Chief Executive, so he called up the Security Bureau. The message was then passed to the Police Chief So did the Chief gave you a telling-off? The Chief called the regional office. And it was passed on to my boss. Then to me, finally. I am a small potato. How would the Chief speak to me? You are right, if you were blasted by the Chief directly then you are somebody. If he is blasting me, you are the first one I am going to whip. I want you to do it because I trust you. We are warned by the Security Bureau all because of that Chan Kin-fei. If this happen again, we'll all be fired. Please, don't touch the rich guys. Okay? Touch me if you want to. I'll be on my pension soon, All right? Please? Pension... I beg you, please. Okay, okay, all right. Are you nuts? Don't mess with Guan Gong. - Pardon me, pardon me. - Have you ever seen Guan Gong munching chips and chocolate biscuits? Also, people offer Guan Gong chickens but never a toy bird. Are you giving him the bird? How dare you say that? That's none of your business. They have their own culture. This is a trendy department. You should try to blend in. You'll be transferred to the back office soon. You kidding? Back office? Back office is the best. Fixed hours, no over time. Paper work as easy as ABC and plenty of hot chicks in short skirts too. Anyway, keep an eye on him 24-7. Like a pair of conjoined twins. Don't piss off Mr Hung again. Once you are done with this, I'll transfer you back. Why are you following me? It's Madam Chu's order. Would you die if she asks you to? I am not following you. You are going back home, so do I. Want me to beat you up? Brother Fei, is that you? The kingpin wants to see you. I knew it. No, wait. I need to go in too. Brother Hoi. Now what? Are you letting me to sit? Get your hands off me. Tea? Interestingly enough, the first brew is always bitter. Want to throw it away The sweetness only comes off after the second brew. You are not summoning these fellas to escort me to tea, right? Show some respect, this is Brother Hoi. What the heck are you doing? You want my attention? Sorry, Brother Hoi. Not to me. I am sorry, Brother Fei. Put your hands to work, will you? You little bastard. Have you seen my daughter today? I did, but I was at work. I don't care. - You have met her, that's it. - So what? I have been around for ages, and I'm not scared of anyone. But this daughter of mine is worrying me. She used to be glum all day. Wrist cutting, drugs, you name it, so depressing. But not today. She is all cheerful after seeing you. See it for yourself, it is even on weibo. Kiss, Kiss. Made my day. To be honest, she only listens to you. Quit the police, it is a waste of your talent. I have got only one daughter, you see. What can I do to make you work for me? All right, if you quit being a gangster, I'll quit being a cop. You son of a bitch. Okay, you got balls, cheers. Oh, so you are really befriending gangsters. Of course not. I only dated her daughter before. Good that you two have broken up. Police and triads, makes the perfect star-crossed lovers. What's wrong with that though? I only realised how pathetic I was after dating his daughter. It is kinda gay for two of us to hang out on valentine's day. Why don't we go home and jerk off? I did this morning. Dude, but I haven't. Be patience. Couples argue on valentine's day. Chicks would all lose their minds after breaking up. And what's next? They hook up with some random guy. Tonight, we are going to be that random guy. You always carry that dumb look on you face but you are kinda hawkish inside. Well, I make do with whatever is available. Babe. Why were you chattering with the waitress just now? I didn't. - Leave this to me. - You didn't? But I saw everything. Hey, sweetie, listen. I really didn't. Stop right there, Police. Are you okay, miss? Was he bullying you? Yes. Give back his crappy gift. I am not taking this. Don't worry, we are Police. We can protect you. Why are you bullying her? She is such a hot chick. What's wrong with you? Sir, I didn't. She is not hot by the way. What did you just say? Your ID card. Take out your ID card. There you go. Chan Kwok-fung...Break up with this kind of scum already! Miss, were you looking for me? I am heart-broken. Heart-broken? You look happy though? Is this curable? Oh, that's a deep cut. What can I do then? Go home with me. You will be fine after an injection or two. Morning. I got this when I had a row with dad. And this one after a fight with the first boyfriend. That one when my boyfriend bought me flowers. This one when the Ngong Ping cable car broke down. Didn't it break down a few times? So three more here. All right, stop counting. What? You don't like it? I'll never cut my wrist then. I'll never cut and never do drugs. You do drugs? I was high on drugs when you saw me grinning last night, didn't you know? I am not a regular user, only when I do compensated dating. I'll never do that again. Never. Well, what will you do then, if you quit all your "hobbies"? I'll just look at you, from day to night. Hey, who sent you that message just now? I thought she was just joking at the beginning. But then I figured that she really had nothing else to do. Hey,babe? What are you doing? Do you miss me? I am in a meeting. I'll call you back. In a meeting? Why are you on Whatsapp then? Who are you chatting with? Darling. Nah, we have done it twice last night. I read through all your messages. Who is Fat Wah? Fat Wah? Just an inspector. Is Fat Wah a woman? Why did she say, I miss U, baby, Kiss Kiss. Oh, that one. It is an important piece of evidence. That's why he sent it back to me. Go call up Fat Wah now. Don't move! Hello, yes? I am working, what do you want? It won't take long. Just one question. Go shoot, darling. What is your Facebook password? What? Why? You can't let me know? She takes away my clothes whenever she showers. If I don't sneak out, she is going to cut off my willy one day. What are you doing honey? I was about to switch on the TV. TV'? How am I supposed to hear what you are doing outside? Right. Come on, go back to bed. Darling. What...what are you doing? Mind your own business. Don't go. What are you doing. Oh, shit. Shame on you. Running around topless. You bitch, you are naked anyway. Nuts. Oh my god. That's Hong Kong girls. They are so agreeable before entering the relationship And then all clingy once you are couple. You are a virgin, what do you know. Maybe that's why your dad got scared away. She's my mum. You can't say that. Why are you here, dad? Something wrong with mum? No, just go- What is that face for? Be quick. Uncle, meal is ready. Where are you? See that? We are screwed if we don't bail. What about mother then? - No idea. - There is nothing we can do. Just make sure you don't eat anything. Fei Fei, you are back? Oh, you must be Johnny. That's right. I've made you dinner. Go wash your hands. Ah, right. I almost forgot the dinner appointment with my colleague. Now you mention it, I got an appointment with my colleague too. You too? Yes...dinner with you. But I have cooked for both of you. Dad, dad loves home-cooked meals. - Dad. - Uncle, how about you? L...l... - Damn. - Do you know how much effort and time I have spent cooking this meal? You are turning me down without even trying it. How heart-breaking it is. Call the cops. No way. I am Police. If anything goes wrong. I'll shoot her. Don't stand in my way, okay? All right. We'll have it. Excellent! It is all ready, dig in. Good. Bessie made everything tonight. Except the soup. Amazing. You are such a pretty girl, and a good cook, too. Fei, you should bring her home for dinner more often. O...okay. Uncle, auntie, Johnny, Fei Fei, bon appetit. Bon appetit. Auntie, try this pork. Thank you, thank you. I have gained so much weight recently. I am not eating. Only the soup will do. You go ahead. Uncle, try some. Dad, don't worry about me. Go eat. Drink some soup. Fei Fei, let me spoon-feed you. Open up, I am spoon-feeding you. Um...delicious. Have some soup. Johnny. Go have some. Try the drumstick, it's good for you. Why aren't you two eating? Are they not good enough? Want some more? Auntie Gill, I know there are a lot of creepy crawlers around. So I have bought this one for you. Bessie, how considerate you are. I must hand you a big red packet later. Thank you. Right, do you need to work tomorrow? No. How about staying overnight? Great! Johnny, go set up shop in the living room tonight and leave your room to them. Understand? Do as I said, now dig in. Fei Fei, I have found these in your room. I have a feeling that they don't belong to you. If they are yours, I'll be very upset, YOU know? Dad... Johnny. How many times have I told you not to leave stuff around? Go take care of them. Me'? Yes, you. Johnny, you have been watching those stuff? That's gross. They are really bad for you! Promise me, never watch them again, okay? So humiliating. Sorry everyone. Go on, keep eating. "Weapon firing in Progress - Keep Out" I was trying to find out what was that We are men, don't be that embarrassing As long as you don't over do it, it is good for you No, I was just scratching This is called "Auto scratcher" Amazing at scratching Let me tell you Before I met your mum This really helps me a lot But I no longer need it now Don't worry, I cleaned it If you want to be more comfort, better use some lotion with it Vaseline or lemon juice can do If you really don't have any, ketchup or salad sauce could work Dude, you have taken my seat. Your seat? We are Mr Cool and Mr Awesome. This park is our turf. Get the hell out of here! I am not going, why should I go anyway? Stop bothering me. Just leave me alone, all right? This guy really got nothing on him. Have you got family? Don't mention family. I have been bullied by the newcomers ever since mum got remarried. Stepdad even caught me with my pants down jerking off. Oh, got caught wanking? That's totally traumatizing. When was it anyway? What when? Just now! Just...just now? You are jerking off because it is all in the hormone. There is a much bigger world out there. Go get yourself a girlfriend and you will be fine. I'll show you this girl, she is nice. Let's get going. A very refined one. Come on, let's go. Such a kindhearted girl. She feeds them every night at the park. Not only is she sweet. She also has a super power. There is this old man with a broken leg. She dined with him once, and he was cured right away. He even got a promotion afterwards! She is a very special girl. The healing-type. No, she is feeding the puppies. I don't want to bother her. Chill, bro. You can't judge a book by its cover. Why don't you learn to appreciate her inner beauty? Yes, that's right. Mr Cool, Mr Awesome, Hello. Princess, let me introduce a new friend to you. He is... - Johnny. - Let me introduce myself. I am petite princess. Pleasure to meet you. I have just met you but it feels like I have known you forever. Too close, too close. Thanks, thanks. Sorry about that. That's okay. I get it. No one ever laid eyes on me for more than three seconds. They only care about looks. They tease and bully me even when I try to help them. It is hard to find people like Mr Cool and Mr Awesome. They never ditched me and are always supportive. L...l am really...really... Tell me about it. People always think I am weird and sissy. Aren't we the perfect match? Hey, Johnny, have you ever thought of your future? Future? I want a family of my own. Get a nice wife. Don't chase after me... Babe, from now on, no other woman will ever sleep with you. Babe, you are up? Shall I make breakfast for you? But you have to see me off to work. Oh wait, you work for Mr Hung, right? Do you know what did Lau Jing do for Hung? Lau Jing? He used to work for Hung at the depot. But Hung never brought along when he was meeting Lau. I don't know what he did exactly. Where is the depot then? Are you asking me for a favour? I guess you know what you need to do, Babe? Morning, Ms Lo. What's that? Over here. When we do our investigation, we mustn't pull out guns. Otherwise we might attract their attention. So I brought along this erectable rod. This is no joke. It is called the "King Kong" erectable rod. See? It is shrunk. And now stretched out again. Handy. My weapon of choice. Do you know what you are talking about? - You don't understand? - Of course not. No idea what you just said. Which way? Right. This baton of yours, can you sell it to me after this? I want to teach this guy a lesson. Certainly. Don't forget to shoot video when you use it. It is all empty here. Hey, go check out the containers will you? What? Those are all empty. There is nothing but coffee beans. Boss doesn't run any coffee bean business though. There is nothing in the depot. How do you investigate? The coffee beans are to deceive the sniffer dogs. Even if that's true, the stuff are all gone already. What can you do? That's why we are here. Hey, open the door, you son of a bitch. What wind blows you here, Pok Sir? I am Chan Sir, you son of a bitch. There are so many different kind of drugs nowadays Actually these are my medicines My style of my medicine are more than the buffet set - You may die soon then - How nice of you! Check what was this being put together with before you die. Then was then and now is now Back then, Methamphetamine and Cocaine, I can tell by a sniff Now I can't smell anything even feces is right in front of me Hold on Your nose is bleeding Half past, just about time The Drug Squad got a secret weapon. Follow me. My colleague got an extremely good nose. She can smell stuff that are undetectable by the police dogs. Just a couple of days ago, we were at Yuen Long. She could tell the what's in Fat To's dishes from the wok he used. But I've heard that she doesn't get along with people, and hang outwith stray dogs all the time. She acted strangely this morning. She did mention something like...a break up. And was beaten by the boyfriend. Don't bother to hide, she can sniff you out. Slept with her yet? No? Hooked her up? Or the other way round? Dumped her? Dated her? You ruined her face? What happened? Can it be saved? Are you kidding me? She's your type? Dude, you must have gone through something. Or...you are masochistic? Dad caught him wanking. When was that? That serious? Last night. Man, we know how it feels. I didn't gang up with him on this. Come on, put your feelings aside. Remember, you owe me...forever. Okay, I'll get all your condom supply from now on. Go do the talking. You are back finally. So you realise you are wrong? I am sorry. Never mind. Never blamed you for that. But I always wanted to go to Verona with my sweetheart. It is the home of Juliet. All right. Sniff this package for me and I'll go with you. Pay me the deposit first. Very well... This is even more crowded than Huanggang. Why don't we just go there instead? It is lively here. The Peak has always been a special place for me. Mum and dad used to bring me here. Good times. You know, I have never been to the Peak before. Well then, that's good. I have been daydreaming of the perfect date ever since a kid. We have got a whole list of things to do today. See? 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... Help! Big deal. There aren't much you can do up here. The view, the wax statues, ice-cream, balloons and photos. That's all. Chop-Chop- Sorry, he's just a little shy, enjoy. Go over there. You know the peak well, huh? Wax statues, ice-cream and photos. Who did you go with? With you of course. Who else? You even got a stomach ache from the oysters. Don't get snappy with me. Right, I forgot. I'll spare you this time. Kong gals... Let's get started. Right, item 25, let's go. Lamma Island. Fei Fei, look! That's Kwun Tong. Lamma is over there. Yes, I meant Lamma. - And that's Sai Wan. - Wan Chai Don't you have any sense of direction? Why I do I need that? I just follow you around. Remember that restaurant we went to? The curry was cold, and the salad was warm. Oh, and that waiter. I almost punched him in the face. He told me Indians like their curry cold. Outrageous. You used to do so many drugs, huh. You memory is not so screwed up after all. That was the happiest days in my life. How can I forget that? That's Sky 100. Never been there before. It must be fun jumping out -from the 100th floor. - Hey, not again. I didn't ask you to jump with me. Don't ever jump off buildings you troublemaker. Just do your occasional trip over. If I really trip over, will you hold me up? No way if you do it on purpose. Of course I will hold you up if it's an accident. Pinky swear. So childish, Typical Kong gals. Thank you very much. You are so kind. So...You got some terminal disease? What are you saying? I may look innocent, but I am not stupid. You hang outwith me all day at the Peak. You must be with some terrible illness or you are keen to get rid of bad luck. You look kinda sincere. So I'll help you anyway. Can you really cure people from bad luck? I don't know. But they always disappear after the first date. Don't worry about that. You have been so kind to me. You will be rewarded one way or another. Well, I consider myself a lucky guy. I don't need any extra luck. How about I buy you lunch? Excuse me... Hey. Hey. Excuse me. Hey. Okay, okay. They'll ignore you unless you speak Mandarin. Leave this to me. Go sniff the package. Waiter, take our order. Please, take a sniff at the coffee beans. Were they placed together with other stuff? I'll give it a shot. Miss, we do not allow outside food here. She...she is not eating. She is only smelling. Did you see her eating? Are you sure? Done thinking with your bottom already? Shut up and take our order. What are you ordering? A lemon tea -and hotdog for me. - How about this lady? A sandwich and mineral water for her. Still or sparkling? I don't care, as long as it is free. I want a "pee zer". Sorry? "Pee zeeer" Pizza. Pizza. A "pass tor" for me please. What "pass tor"? Pasta. Pasta. Your Mandarin is so poor. I am warning you, don't spit on my food, or I'll call the police. - What's in there then? - What's in there then? Two things: Cocaine and Methamphetamine What is Methamphetamine? Crystal Meth. It has no smell though, how do you know? None of your business. That won't work. We don't have any evidence. Her olfaction doesn't mean anything. I don't understand. Hung's businesses are so diverse, he doesn't need to sell drugs. Those property developers are filthy rich anyway. But they are still opening new drug stores, electric appliance stores and supermarkets. That means there is something fishy about the depot. If nothing is going on in there, why would Hung ask Lau Jing to look after it? If it is empty at the moment, perhaps he is going to stock up sometime later. Are you two planning to sneak in again? - No. - Nope. There is no way the guard booth is empty. The guard is human too. He needs to eat and take a dump, huh? You are right. They really stocked up. Customs exemption... These just arrived. Damn, this is a huge stock. We should have asked your girl to have a sniff. She is not my girl. She is yours anyway. Hey, what are you doing here? Director Tsui, let me do the talking. Who are you? I am the security guard. Security guard? We have been around for half an hour, unnoticed. You call yourself security guards? Where is your supervisor? I am the supervisor. - Supervisor? - Yes. We are supposed to meet Mr Hung here. Where is he? Just a moment. Check with Mr Hung's secretary. See if he has an appointment with them. Director Tsui said, this place is not secure enough. We are not taking the stuff. Director Tsui, we can go now. Dude, since when were you fluent in Mandarin? I never said I don't. Do you think they are falling for this? Good bye, Director Tsui. It works for now. They'll figure out when we get to the car though. Hey, if we can escape in one piece, you won't get away with that slap. I'll pay you back tenfold. Dear guests, shall we rehearse again? Thanks. "Do You Think You Can't Dance", ready. I didn't touch it. Stop, stop, stop... Do you know how to dance? - Just keep going. - First Lady. - Relax. - You are blocking the camera. - You are blocking the camera. - Yes. How many times have I told you yesterday? The camera must face me this way. - Make it a profile shot. - Boss, your call. - Yes, you are right. - I am telling you. - No, look at me. - I donate more than a million every year. Yes, your excellency. Smarten up, okay? Tell the first lady how much have I donated? 3 million. 3 million! I donated 3 million. Do I deserve a close up? My sons are so unorganized. Didn't let us know we have guests. They are not even here. The home is in a mess, sorry about that. Have some tea. Thank you, thank you. You are Johnny's colleague? Well, at the moment. Right. Will see how it goes. So you are still dating Fei? We are together again after last time. How did you know Johnny? I met him at the park one night. Some old folks introduced me to him. Then he asked me to sniff something for him. He took me to the Peak after that. My Johnny boy went to the Peak? Uncle caught him playing with himself, so he ran away from home. You mean jerking off? Right. Jerking off? Are you joking? My son was jerking off, how filthy! You never tell me? And you didn't let me know. He is my son...And you caught him... Auntie, the gas is leaking. Impossible, I use electric stove. Auntie, is the soup burnt? I didn't make soup. "Go, go... - What's up? Go, go... Why are we going? Hey, Why going out? quickly. - You can't go in. - We are police too. Mum,mum. No way. - Johnny - Are you okay? I was scared to death. Over here, -you know? - Fei Fei. The petite princess saved us all. She asked us all to get out. You know? You really did save my mum and Uncle Chan? Really? Don't mention it. I have jotted it down in my notebook. We'll settle this later. Hello, who's speaking? Why did your home caught fire? We have warned you not to meddle with us. You son of a bitch. How dare you touch my family? Let's fight man to man. Hanging up on me, hey? I'll take revenge. Why don't we leave this to the police? Come on, we are police. Wanna bring along your mum to help? Fei, stop this nonsense. You have been so hooked up by this case. They are now after us. You think that's great? The house has now blown up. What more do you want? This has nothing to do with him. Haven't I pay you the housekeeping money? We are not living here for free. My home has blown up. I didn't even say a thing. You didn't say a thing? You have been complaining the moment we rushed out. Where is your boss? What do you want? He is trying to blow us all up. That proves he is up to something. If we want to get him arrested, we need to prove that he is storing drugs at his depot, right? Are you asking me for a favour, Fei Fei? Sorted out the officials? Yes, no worries. Just make sure no one is in our way. Mr Hung. Fetch a chair for the officer. - Dig in. - No thanks. We are both bastards. But you like to get your nails polished. And me? I like to be a cop. I have poor EQ, I get mad easily. If someone is disturbing my family, I am going to make him suffer. Your sausage stinks. Do you know where you are now? Know what it means to be posh? Don't you try to blackmail me. I run a property business. Whoever's house is in my way, I'll knock it down. If you want a comfortable retirement, get smart. You civil servant. I am talking to you. - Don't touch me. - Stop right there. You. Here comes another small-fry. I thought this is an exclusive club? Brother Hung, Hi, Brother Hung. Don't you brother me, you wimpy shrimp. Sorry manager. He likes to use toilets in classy places. I'll lecture him later. Sorry about that. Sorry Brother Fei. Someone called the police. So we have to do something. How about going back with us first? How about cuffing me up as well? Did you call the police? They are taking mum and uncle Chan's verbal statement at the station. Bullshit Sweetie, found it yet? Tell him what is this. Stay away from drugs. Not those. Stand Firm, Knock Drugs Out! This is my retirement countdown calendar. 900 days. I just need 900 days of peace and I am done. The listed firms are all inviting me to join their board of directors. I'll be taking care of all their security projects. All I need is to stay away from trouble. No blunders, no flub-ups, and I'll retire safe -and worry-free, too. - Boss they are offering you the job two years before your retirement. Doesn't that make you one of the corrupt scums? Who doesn't want a second career when you are off the government's payroll? It's the unwritten rule. Anyway, enough of that. Mr Hung filed a complain against you. Blackmail and assault. He called up the Chief Executive, and is demanding an explanation. He was trying to blow up my mum and dad. Sir, Is that Chan Kin-fei's voice? They disturbed my family. Am I supposed to put up with this? Right... They blew up your mum? Fei is calling me mum. He is treating me as his mother. He is treating me as family. "Bessie: I tripped over." Damn! The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. Please try again later. Boss, my girl was investigating Hung's depot for me. Her text said she had tripped over. Her phone is off too. She must be in trouble. Let me save her. I type those words every day in my messages Big deal? The phone's off for two minutes. She's been missing for less than 24 hours. The 999 won't even file your case. If I shut down his depot, I am going to lose my job. Sir, we are not kidding. Bessie never types messages like that. She must be in danger. There is something fishy about Hung's depot too. Who are you? Why weren't you knocking? What door, I don't see one. I was listening next door. I can't help coming over to set things straight. This is my office. I am the one who set things straight. When I was a cop, you weren't even born yet. We cracked the Po Sang Bank robbery, when your boss was still in high school. I really don't understand cops nowadays. You guys are so scared of complaints. Complaints from councilors, reporters, rich folks, the only thing you aren't scared of is the public. Even the gangsters are way tougher than you. Aren't you ashamed of being a cop? Now that my son's sweetheart is in danger, all you know is to dodge from responsibility. Hey, don't give me that. You want to get arrested or what? Don't even try. I'll file a complaint if you stand any closer. Hey, you work under me. I am being blackmailed, -go take action. - Sir, she is my mum. It's you who wanted to arrest her. Can you guys shut up for a sec? Sir, I know I am ill-tempered. I have always been a drag. But please let me save Bessie. I'll take sole responsibility. Responsibility? How? You say that every single time. But it always goes down to me. I have this warrant card with me all the time. But if I knew someone is in danger and I did nothing to save her, I don't think I can call myself police. Bro, damn right. Ever seen any cop staying at the office all day just to write reports? Yes, a real waste of talent like me. I am quitting too. Wait, what are you guys doing? Did I ask you to go? This suspect, is ridden with psychological problems. You need to escort him to the psychologist. Do it now. One more thing, he is a prime suspect. Bring your gun. In fact, our very prime suspect. Bring two, make haste. Thank you, Sir! Well, I saw nothing. Was at the restroom just now. I am now on my way to the toilet again. Honey, There are some good cops after all. Do they deserve a merit? Right, fetch me Philip Chan's number. Guess you have retired ages ago. Philip is so last century. That bloke is now running night clubs in Shenzhen. He's retired? Still want his number? Is he still around? You think he is a real cop? Just go. Where is my daughter? I have my gang with me. She is missing because of me. I asked her to investigate for me. Trust me, I'll bring her back. If anything goes wrong, I'll chop you into pieces. Thank you for the encouragement. I am more determined than ever. Wait for me. I am counting on you. Master Yim's prophecy really came true. He warned me to keep distance from women this year. You have worked for me for so long, have I ever touched you? Not yet. You are such a traitor. When did you chuck in so much stuff in the boot? I have got everything ready. Go put on the body armor. Whoa, body armor? - Just to be safe. - Right, what else? And this one. Look,bazooka. Powerful stuff. Yeah, powerful shit. You only work for me because of them? No. Did he ever make outwith you? Just occasionally... here and there. Are you religious? I am flexible, whatever suits you. Don't mind getting married at a church. I am talking about funeral home. You fool. You have even got this. It is hard to come by. The most expensive one of all. Smart kid. What else? - Smoke grenade. - Yes. Shock grenade. M-60 bullets. - How about the guns? - Should be arriving the day after. Never mind. This should be enough. Where did you get all these anyway? Arms dealer? No, just got them off Taobao. This is real powerful stuff. Stallone used this in The Expendables. Cost me 500 bucks. The comments said it is much safer than the 300 one. - Safe right? - Of course. How about we try this one out? Dude, I spent 800 for this one. Air pistol, works well as a bluff. Never mind. I'll stick to mine. If I have any leftover bullets, I am going to stick them in your head. We will outflank them from below and above. Check out what's going on. I'll go up, you stick to the ground. - I heard something. - Let's go that way. Hey miss, it is really dangerous here. Go, go. HQ, HQ. Intruders. Run. Oh, that's 99 bucks gone. Miss, this is police. Mamma mia. I don't beat up women, but I have no choice. Don't come close. Help! Help! No, no, No, don't loose it. Please don't. Come save me. Can't hold this any longer. - You'll be fine. - Don't go. Hold on. Come fetch you later. Is falling! Is falling! Now what? Think you are tough beating up my bro? Tough girl. Flying kick huh? I knew it. Bro, hold on. 99 bucks. Hold on, bro. Stretch your arm out, sucker. - Come on, be quick. - Hold on... I got it...l got it... Shock her. Her shoe is in the way. Take it off quick. Give this bitch a good shock. Stop moving. Guys, stop fighting. It's heavy. I'm losing it. Dude, you are so lame. Such an awful fall. Hey, stand up. You are holding me back every time. No way, I just saved your life. Did you? You didn't die falling from up there. That means I saved you. Drop dead! No. You know? Watch out, bro. Hey, you. Come out. Are you joking? You think you are still in charge? Cops are on their way. Two choices. One, drop your gun and surrender to the police. Two, drop your gun and bail from the back door. I'll pretend I saw nothing. I am an honest businessman. I stand by my service charter. I won't go unless the buyer got his stuff. Two choices. One, quit your job and work for me. Two, be the next Lau Jing. Lau Jing? He got murdered working for you. - How can I work for you? - That bastard. He already got everything paid for, and he still stole stuff from me. Your girl is now trying to ruin my trades. What for? Are you jealous? Hostility to the rich? I count to three. If you don't come out, she is dead. One, two... Wait, wait. Fei Fei, tell me, have you ever loved me? You hear that? She is such a drag. Just kill her once and for all. I have always wanted to dump her. Shoot her and I'll buy you dinner. Kong gals like you really deserve this. He doesn't even like you. You still let him screw you. I should have you instead. Only a few times. Fine, Chan Kin-fei. I am cutting my wrist in front of you. I'll count to three again. Come out or she's dead. One, two... Fei Fei, Fei Fei. I knew you won't dump me. I always knew you love me. You figured the secret code. Such a smart guy. I love you. Quiet, take this. Wake up you lame duck. We can go now. Stop pretending, wake up. You want me to carry you? Come, come. Man... Wake up man. What's up? Answer me. Bro... You shouldn't have taken that two shots, you fool. Wake up now. I promise. If you wake up, I'll never beat you again. Never bully you. Never snatch away your toys. I'll give your chair back. Get up, will you? It is hard to find a little bro like you. Wake up you bastard. Why are you waking me up? Hey, you aren't dead? Your mouth is full of blood. What are you doing? You know, I am just an office clerk. After the big fight, then the big fall from up there. I felt so tired. And I saved you too. You are really heavy YOU know? And the blood... Ah ha, I have bitten my tongue. See? It is all red here. Oh, did you just call me bro? I'll beat the living shit out of you. I didn't said nothing. And you heard nothing. Wait, no. I really heard it just now. You are lying, you liar. That line sounds kinda familiar... Are you two okay? - Boss. - Boss. - It was awesome just now. - Yes, we... Say nothing. Just write your report. You are good at it. Two copies. One with my name and one without. No idea how would they react tomorrow. You know, I am retiring soon. Thanks for your understanding. Everyone, go take a look. Yes, sir! Thank you. I am going. Our boss is a real chicken hawk. Anyway, make an extra copy, without my name. Me fighting off dozens, who would believe that? Your mum would. She will be happy. Fei Fei, wait for me. Even my mum won't believe it. Wait! Fei Fei. What the hell? Hey, you didn't answer me. Have you ever loved me? You are a Kong gal after all... Tell you when we get home, okay? Yes. Take these to the lab. Yes. Go tidy things up. Yes, madam. What have you done? You Okay? I am fine. We were high up there just now. I was hanging over there. Then barn! I fell off to the ground over there. Then I saved Fei, my bro. Check this out. I took two shots for him at the back. There is a hole in there. That's fine. You see, I got this off Taobao. Half grand. It saved my life too. Not the best deal. That's a lot of blood. Don't worry, I won't touch you.
