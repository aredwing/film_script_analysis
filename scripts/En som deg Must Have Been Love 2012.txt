You don't remember me? - Remember you from...? - From Istanbul. From Istanbul? No, I'm sorry. I think you've mistaken me for someone else. - I'm sorry. - No, that's fine. Take some nuts for me. And also a little bit of... No, sorry, we have to go. No, she's not angry. We just have to go. - Can I have the keys? - I don't have them. Here they are. I haven't washed my hair in three days. Good, good. - Let me know if you need anything. - If I need any service? Sorry? Can I still buy something, very fast? Helmi! I'm glad that band didn't come over to our table. Yeah, thank God. Excuse me. Can I borrow your phone? Where we are from? - Can I borrow your phone? - You need a phone? I left my phone and my keys up there, so... - Have you locked yourself out? - Yes. My friends are upstairs, though. - They might be sleeping. - You know their numbers? By heart? You know them by heart? Yeah, they're my old friends. - Do you know my number, August? - Of course I know your number. Very good. - I even know it with a melody. - Let's hear. - And that's not all. - I'll try again. Do you know Jacob's number? No. - Is that right? - Totally. If they don't answer, - - you can come up to our place. We live next door. You can just hang at our place. Maybe they'll call back. If they don't, we can find some place where you can sleep. We're not doing anything. We're just going to bed. - Is this OK? - Yeah, it's OK. Absolutely. Because, I mean, I have... My bed is... It's... It's under here somewhere. - Do you need some help? - No, I'm fine. It's... - It's under there? - It is. And... - If you want, you can have this. - No, no. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm fine. I'll just... - I can sleep here. - You can have this. No, I'm fine. This is... This is good. Thanks. - If it's OK for you? - Sure. No problem. Hello? Hi. It's for you. Hi, I'm at the neighbors'. I forgot my keys and my cell phone. Can you come and let me in? - Thanks, for this. - You're welcome. I'll leave now. - Say hello to your friends. - I will. Where have you been? At the neighbors'. Have you been out hunting? What? Have you been on a Turkish man-hunting operation? They were Norwegian. They? Was there more than one? Kaisa... I had such a nightmare. - What about? - I'm not telling you. Why do you dream about him every night? I feel sorry for you. It's horrible. - Give us some details. - I'll tell you nothing! I don't have much more information than you do. - Did you ask what she does? - Feel anything in your heart? I pretty much registered what you did. She's from Finland. She's here on some sort of... Aside from the facts, what did you feel? - What did I feel about what? - The Finn. Cute Finnish girl. That's what I thought. Listen. The ice cream truck. A lullaby. Are you trying to figure out whether Nedved played in '95 or '96? - Or whether Aunt Ada will be... - Nedved was in '96, Ada in '46. - Wrong. Aunt Ada was born... - I need a break. - In '46. - No, she was born in '45. Excuse me, could I borrow a light? - Sure. Gonna catch it? - I'm ready. Thanks. Is that the Norwegians? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Good morning. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. Have you been here a long time? - Three... four days. - Four days. And you? - Hi! - A couple of days. Good morning. - How are you feeling? - I'm fine. They let you inside? - Thank you for taking care of her. - You're welcome. - Are you guys from Finland as well? - Yeah. - Helsinki? - Yeah. - And you are from Oslo? - We're all from Oslo, Norway. - You look like it. - We do? Thank you. But you have oil. Yes, we do. That's why we're here. We could ask them if they want to eat with us. Either go out or eat here. Why don't we eat here, on the balcony? Barbecue? We'll have to buy a grill. - I think there's one here. - In one of the storerooms. - Wouldn't that be nice? - That would be very nice. - Audun, why don't you go ahead... - No, you do it. Yes. - Do you have plans for the evening? - No, we were just discussing that. Do you have any plans tonight? - Are you doing anything special? - No. - Do you want to do something special? - Yes! We were wondering - - if you guys wanted to barbecue with us? - That would be really nice. - When's a good time for you? Around 7-8? Perfect! - Mushrooms. - Mushrooms. Good idea. Are there any bags? Thanks. - And what else? Peppers? - Peppers are great. One more. OK. What is this? Is it closed? Hello? Thank you. Thanks. - Yes... - Yes. It's...Turkish. Mhm. - Should we take two? - Two? - Maybe three? - Maybe. And... Should we go for a white wine as well? Yeah. Do we need something else? I think this is it. Is that the feeling that you want to feel? If that's the feeling I want to feel? - Yes. - Who said that? Like Duracell, you know? Like the battery. You know the Duracell rabbit that jumps up and down? Yes. - Do you know that? - Yes. That's the feeling I have. Is it still there? Because it's turkey, it's like a turkey... - Hello? - Hello. - Hi. There you are. - Hi. Did you go shopping on the Asian side? - The first shop was closed. - And the second shop was closed. The best Turkish wine on the market. Is the fish there? - Are you in charge of the barbecue? - I am indeed. Do you have some... Ooh, I can't watch that. - The grill is slightly warm. - Slightly warm? What do you mean? - And now for a toast to Audun. - To Audun and the fish! Everyone knows the situation when you run to catch a bus. When it drives off without you, why do you stop running and walk slow? Like nothing has happened. Everyone saw you try to catch the bus. Why don't you say, "Dammit, why didn't the bus wait?" It's the same when you fall down. You jump up and say, "It didn't hurt!" You're never faster than when you get up from a fall. I was on a bike in Oslo and I ran into the tram... - The tram tracks. - Right. With my bike. And I fell over, but got up super fast and was, like, laughing. Why is it like that, that it is so shameful? Like, for example, she has this dream... I don't want to talk about my dreams. - But I need the power to change them. - Please tell us! No, it... OK. - I've just had some... - It's your turn. Some intimate dreams about my ex-boyfriend. I'm not with him anymore and am not supposed to dream about him. I think you're still in love with him. Me too. - That's why you dream about him. - I don't think so. Thank you, Audun. I don't think I'm in love with him anymore. Anyone else want to take over? Jacob? Do you have any secrets? I left my fiance when she went to prison. - No, you didn't! - That wasn't so funny. Yeah, that's... Yeah. - Why did she go to prison? - He's a cruel, heartless man. But why? Is she still in prison? - She's... - Is this a joke? No, it's not a joke. It's not a joke, actually. It's true. Not because she went to prison, but... But, yeah, we... What did she do? She... It was an accident. She hit this guy with her car, and... - You left her because of that? - No, things didn't work out. The way they should. - OK, has anyone... - Want me to tell some more stories? Let's go out and drink some Turkish Pepper! - That sounds good. - There's a bar right nearby. - What's the name of that bar again? - It's called Badehane. - Hi. - Hi. You OK? I'm fine. Just needed a bit of fresh air. Yeah. You guys were... Good company. You too. - Audun is a very funny guy. - He is. He is. He's... He's dear to me. - A good cousin? - Good cousin, good friend. Are you leaving tomorrow? Yeah. We are. Going back home. I had a good time today. Me too. Hey, look at that! - The tram! - There it is! - A friend of yours? - He's an old friend of mine. - We want to go dancing! - Disco, disco! Audun calls them Delights, because we're in Turkey. The Turks wouldn't call them Turkish Delights. The first fur, the very first mink fur... No, 142 is the limit. You should see the goddam bathrooms! Time for raki! What? Nothing. I just said now we have to go drink raki. And that we are waiting for you. We should drink raki. - Can I ask you something? - Yeah, sure. Why did you leave her? - My fiance? - Yeah. Several reasons. What reasons? I don't think this is the time or the place to talk about that. Why? Because it belongs to the past. I'm just... Curious about it. OK. Well, I don't... I don't think we should talk about that now. Are you still together? I'm just asking. What? - I'm sorry. - No, it's OK. Hi. Hi. You are fully integrated into this magical city. - Are you OK? - I'm extremely fine, thank you. She is too. Mhm. Do you know the Finnish long-distance runner Paavo Nurmi? Yeah. They said about him - - that he could run away from everyone and everything. But he could never run away from himself. - Really? - It's true. What time is it, August? It's... - Five. It's five o'clock. - Five o'clock? - Have you packed? - Five o'clock. Not packed. Me neither. We can do it tomorrow. Just stuff our suitcases. - Where's Jacob? - I think he went to bed. I'll go buy some milk. It's early, but the newspaper can be found in thousands of mailboxes. It's quite a logistical challenge. Imagine if you have errands to run. I have a list with five items... It's nice that you take... contact. You can do it again, but try to be in that moment. OK? - Hello! - Hello? - Maria? - Hi! - What's up? - Hang on, I just got another call. Welcome to Vigeland Park, Oslo's largest park, with 214 statues - - by Gustav Vigeland. The theme of this park, in this park, is the circle of life. As you can see here. This man is trying with all his might - - to break the circle of life. That is of course not an easy task. ...the last tree with the young boy, standing straight and... Excuse me, what is this? That is quark. It's kind of like a low-fat sour cream. - Kind of? - Yes. - Like this? - Yes. It's like a sour yoghurt. Or a sour cream. OK. Is it like crme frache? Sure. It tastes a little different, but, yeah, it's similar. OK. Thank you. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. I just came. I don't know anybody from here, so it's nice to see you. How are your friends? I'm sorry? You don't remember me? - Remember you from...? - From Istanbul. From Istanbul? No, I'm sorry. I think you've mistaken me for someone else. Thank you. How come you don't know anyone in Oslo? I just came from Finland. - That's for you. - Thanks. - Cheers! - Kippis. Kippis. - I work here now. - You do? Yeah. I'm not on holiday. No. What's your occupation? What do you do? I'm a dancer, but actually I don't dance anymore. - You don't work as a dancer? - No, I work with choreography. - Nice. - Yeah. It could be. And you? I played basketball. Really? OK. That's nice. Are you good? Well, actually... I'm not too bad. I know a couple of dancers that I work with. - But that's all. - OK. It's hard when you can't speak your own language. There's always some kind of misunderstanding. Can you do this? Like this? OK. Don't smile. Yeah! You look younger. - Younger? - Yeah. OK. Why would I look better without the mustache? You look... Would you like to... Maybe see my place? Your place? My home? - Which one? - This one. I want this one. Falafel in flatbread. OK. Falafel in flatbread. - With brus? - Brus? Absolutely. What is that? - It's like soda. - Oh, OK. Two falafels. - With drink? - With drink. - One drink or two drink? - Two drink. I think this is the loneliest moment. The moment between bar and home. - Hi. - Hi. The food is not ready yet. It's a bit messy. You can take the plates. Should I wash these? I don't think so. So who did you think I was? At the store. No one. You thought I was someone. Maybe, for a while. But... It's nothing. - Are you getting serious? - Serious? No. - What do you mean by serious? - I don't know. Tell a joke, then. - Do you know any jokes? - No. I was just trying to have a lighthearted conversation. No! Please. I'm really ticklish. Really? - Please don't! I mean it. - Really? - You don't like it? - No, I don't like it at all. Stop it! I don't like it, OK? It's uncomfortable. - OK. - OK? I don't understand what I'm supposed to do. I don't get the point. Of this exercise, or this dance? The exercise. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. So it's more than this exercise? I kind of felt it yesterday and the past days we've been training. I'm not really comfortable with it. But I'm trying to find new things, because it's new to me also. I'm used to dancing by myself, so it's... It's hard for me to explain myself with words. I'm... So... - Hi. - Hi. Sorry about... About last time. I don't usually - - end up like that. OK. So I was wondering... To... To make it up to you. Maybe we could do something together? OK. OK? OK. So we're doing... - Something. - Yeah. OK. Wait a second. - I'm not waiting for you. - We're playing! I have never seen - - a basketball player with a mustache. - You haven't? - No. Do you know many basketball players? Michael Jordan. That's it? Yeah. - You know, he used to have a mustache. - Really? And... And you have Charles Barkley. He had a mustache. Clyde Drexler. Karl Malone. Dominique Wilkins. Joe Dumars. Quite many. There are actually quite many basketball players with mustaches. And I think John Stockton had a mustache at one point. There's a small boat. And it's very sad and lonely because no one uses it anymore. And it would rather be a tree or a sauna. But then the man says to the boat - - that he will take it to the lake - - and sail to different cities and different places. Are you OK? Yeah. It just feels... a bit strange. You'll meet people. Yeah. Can you put it there? You want it in the middle of the living room? Yes. It's easier if it's there and I can open those. But this is my box. Yeah, it is. And those are mine. Yeah, but why do you want to... I'm not comfortable with having all my stuff in the middle of the room. We can change places afterward, but... OK. Yeah, sure. - Are you unwrapping stuff? - Yeah, I started from here. But we're not done carrying the boxes. I thought it would be easier if I put some things away. Isn't that kind of messy? OK. Sorry. No, I was just thinking - - that we can finish the boxes first, and then unwrap. - Great. - Shall we go? There's only one box left. I can take it. - But it's not... - I'm... Sorry. - What is it? - It won't stay there. No! I know, but now you're... Just let me finish. Seek out contact. Two and two together, and then one and one. Sorry to interrupt, Kaisa. They called from Berlin. They offered us the residency. We'll rehearse here for a few weeks first, then go to Berlin. - Berlin? - Berlin. - What can I say? - Think about it. This is a good thing. I'll do that. You don't have to finish your meal. You can go. We have nothing here. We could go. I don't want to go to Berlin! If you want to meet them, go. Celebrate. I'm telling you. You don't have to finish the meal. Hi, Kaisa! So glad you could make it. We've already finished that bottle. I'll go get a drink. A glass of white wine, please. Kaisa? - Hi. - Hi. - You remember me? - Yeah. How are you? - I'm fine. - Yeah? - And you? - I'm fine. Nice to see you again. It is. Nice to see you, too. - What are you doing here? - I'm... - I'm working. - OK. And you? - I don't know. - You don't know? - I should go. - Yeah, of course. - It was... - It was... - Nice seeing you. - Yeah. The same. Do you want to go outside for a minute? Yeah? Yeah. Great. I'll get my jacket. I'm in Helsinki. No, I... I just ran into - - Kaisa from Istanbul. Totally by chance. No, she just suddenly... appeared. - This is my stop. - Nice. Yeah, it's almost like home. Really? No. This was... Nice. Good night. Good night. We just said goodbye to each other. And I didn't even get her number. I totally forgot. And I - - want desperately - - to meet her again. - Bye. - Huh? - Bye. - Bye! I have something for you. - Yeah? - Can I see it? Sure. Yeah. It feels... It feels a bit weird. No. It's good for the interview. - Is it tight? - Yes. What if I go like this? That's better. It's... It's uncomfortable. - No, no! - Just let me... Don't take it off. I want to try that one. This feels comfortable. What? Nothing. - You want me to wear this? - Yes. It's better. - Good luck. - Thanks. Hi. Hello? - Hello? - Hi. Hi. Hi. How did it go? OK, I think. Good. They will let me know. When? Tomorrow. I'm just thinking that... This... Yeah? I don't know. Never mind. I didn't go to the interview. I don't know if this... It's not working. It's Kaisa. It's not yourfault. I didn't even leave him a note. I just left. But you have to call him. After meeting him again, by chance. What do I say? "Can we get together?" - For instance. - That makes no sense. Life doesn't always make sense. Not calling him definitely makes no sense. I don't know. I'll just torment myself. What if I fall head over heels, - - and can't even finish my work in Berlin? Just sit around drawing hearts everywhere. Call him. You have nothing to lose. Start with a simple hello. If you want to see him again, that is. - I do want to see him again. - There you go. I'm trying to reach... A person by the name of Jacob. He's a guest at your hotel, or has been... And he's Norwegian. Is he still there? - Hi! - Hi. Are you OK? Yeah. When do you leave? This afternoon. And then what? And then... And then I'll travel around. Yeah? All the time? All the time. Can't you stay for a while? - And call in sick? - Yeah. It's not that easy. It's not easy? No, I pretty much have meetings all over. - Teach me something in Finnish. - Sukkahousut. I don't know. I felt that there was a good vibe. - Right. - Right. So you're a little confused about what actually happened? But in the morning I went to take a shower, - - and when I came back out, she was gone. - What? She had left? - She had left. She didn't leave her phone number or anything. And I really feel we had something special. That we both had a good experience. - Great. - Yeah. So what are you going to do now? Any extra items of business that have come up? Then let's go through last year's results. You are here. Yeah.
