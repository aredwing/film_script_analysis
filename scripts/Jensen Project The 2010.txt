It's just like Nitromaniacs. That's a video game! This is an airplane! And when my mom finds out we stole it... We didn't steal it. It's Jensen property. I'm a Jensen employee, and we're on a Jensen mission. She'll buy that! Oh, I'm so dead! Not if we get back the molecular assembler... and save the world! Trust me, you'll go from juvie to hero in one night. Assuming I survive this... - Hang on! - Ahh! Brody, how many times do I have to tell you... to use a glass? Brody! Ah! Oh! Ah... Thanks! Keys! Keys! Has anybody seen my keys? Entryway table. Not there. The pants you were wearing last night. Here. You're a genius! Ow! Ow! So I've been told. Hey, Mom, I don't feel that great. Can I stay home? - You don't seem feverish. - Well... It... it's more in my chest. You stay up late, texting your friends, leave your homework to the last possible second, and now all of a sudden you're sick? I don't think so! But what if I infect the whole school? Luckily, your father's specialty is immunology! Brody... Listen, I know you find school boring. Just try to make the most of it, okay?. Whatever. - Is everything okay? - Fine. Are you sure? We'll talk about it another time. Suit yourself. Oh, I gotta go. I booked satellite time for my students. I can't be late. Whoa! I already am late! This is Claire Thompson. We're not home. But you can leave a message after the beep. You stay up late... last possible second. You don't seem feverish. Infect the whole school... Marshall Heights High School. This is Mrs. Johnson. How may I help you? This is Claire Thompson. Brody stayed up late. He seems feverish. We don't want him to infect the whole school. - We're gonna keep him home. - Thanks for calling. If com sat is at current position, and travelling at a constant speed, who can tell me how long we'll maintain contact... at maximum-signal performance? Anyone? Quiz on chapters Please be prepared! Nice work, Josh. Can't believe we got satellite time! I called in a favor. I just thought the class would be more into it, though. Can I ask you a question? - Sure. - You went to MIT... and graduated with 2 advanced degrees. Instead of telling us about the latest tech, why aren't you designing it? I have to take this. I'll see you Monday. Claire Thompson. Hi, Mrs. Thompson! It's Mrs. Banks I wanted to let you know, I emailed Brody his homework assignment. Why? - The office said you called. - I called? About his being sick today. Right. I hope he feels better. Not likely! Not after I get done with him. E... I... O... U... Whoo! It's like he can't get a full breath. Does he have a history of asthma? - No. - Huh. Bronchitis? No. - Laryngitis? - No. Sinusitis? - No. - Rhinitis? No. - Pneumothoraxis? - No. - Aspergillosis? - Mm-mmm. Hmm... You a smoker? No, sir. That's good. Keep it up. Okay... Open wide. Ahh... Okay, I found the problem, I think. Your son... has a very bad case of rhinosis... gummerius... Is that serious? Not very... Quint! I am so sorry to have wasted your time, Doctor! It could've been worse. It could've been a real worm. Rough day? Nothing worth talking about. What are you doing here? - It's Brody. - What now? - He cut school, again! - What do you mean, again? The school said that he used your letterhead... to write notes 3 times in the last 2 months... and that the next absence would require a call from one of us. So he faked my voice. Okay, how'd he do that? I have no idea, but he was convincing enough to fool his teachers. Ha-ha! Clever kid! Too clever for his own good! Maybe that's the problem! Maybe he's in the wrong environment... - to... - Matt, don't start. Not talking about it won't solve the problem, Claire. What is it? Ingrid? Claire, what a surprise to see you here. Uh... ditto. So, uh... to what do we owe the honor after all these years? The Jensen Project is in trouble. I came to ask Claire to help us. Me? You want me to help you? Okay, why don't we, uh... all sit down and we'll talk about this... You two can talk all you want. I'm outta here! Claire... Honey, wait. - Claire... Claire! Hey! - No! No! No! When I needed her, she was not there for me! There is no way I'm gonna... Let's... When Edwin humiliated you... Today... we've just witnessed utter failure. You were understandably hurt by what he said. Hurt? As her mentor, I... I should've recognized the limitations... of her talent and intellect. - I was devastated. - I know, what he said was cruel. Your work... isn't good enough. You... aren't good enough. I admired Edwin more than you could possibly imagine. I think what hurt more than his words... was knowing how badly I disappointed him. Nobody understands better than me how it's haunted you. And I know you don't wanna hear this, but I still think we should talk to Ingrid. Why? Because maybe it's an opportunity! What are you talking about? An opportunity for what? I don't know! I don't know. To revisit the past! To somehow repair the damage that was done to you. I have no idea. But it... It can't hurt to hear what Ingrid has to say! Please, Claire. Do this for me. Edwin left the Jensen Project. Took his whole team... and several experimental projects, including yours. So what? It didn't work. Remember? It works now. After you left, Edwin continued your research on electro nanobots. He what? And over the years, he perfected the work that you created. This technology can save millions of lives. It can just as easily destroy millions. I don't follow you. What... Nanobots are computers the size of molecules. They can be implanted in human tissue. In a battle, for example, a soldier is wounded. If he's implanted with a nanobot, it could tell the medics his exact location. It could even stabilize his bodily functions. That's good, isn't it? Unless the enemy gets control... of the computer that manages the nanobots. They could wipe out an entire army... by giving every soldier in the field a massive coronary. By simply pressing a button. This technology could be a blessing, or it could be a nightmare, depending on who's controlling it. And right now that's Edwin? That's why I've come to you. When Edwin left, he wiped the drives clean. I have no idea how he got from my model to... You have more of an idea than anyone else! Certainly anyone else in the Jensen family! I haven't been in the Jensen family in a long time. - Why not go to the authorities? - If the media got wind of this... the negative spin could destroy the Jensen Project... and all of the good work we've done! We need you! We need both of you, and we need you now. Whoo! Hey, Jimmy, I thought 20 bucks bought me another... What were you thinking? I was thinking you'd never find out. How'd you know where I was, anyway? Your mom used a satellite to track your cell phone. - What? - You pretended to be me... so you could skip school. Not cool, buddy. Oh, and by the way, you are totally grounded. Look, I can explain. I was testing the rates of noise reduction in isolated audio signals. - I wrote an app, that can... - It doesn't matter what you were doing. What matters is that you lied to the school... and you lied to us. Okay, I'm sorry. Where are we going? We're sending you to military school. What? Look, Mom, I'll change! - Can't we talk about this? - You're not going to military school! - Then where're we going? - We're going back. Back where? To save the day, I hope! And while we're at it, maybe the world! Why did Edwin choose now to leave the Jensen project? My fault. He wanted to skip the usual protocols... and advance the nanobot to its next phase. Just wanted him to go slowly. Unfortunately, Edwin and I don't communicate very well. Hey, Mom, what's this Jensen Project, you guys keep talking about? It's a group of really smart people... who work together to make the world a better place. How come I've never heard of it? Let's just say that anonymity is important to us. - So how do you join? - You don't. You have to be invited. You guys, like, members? We were... once. Ms. Jensen, we have security clearance... to land in the compound. Your onco-gene research, the glucose-monitoring device... and your servomechanisms for robotics... Truly transformative work, Edwin. - Thank you. - But, sir... as we discussed, sir, it's your nanobot technology... that most interests my associates and me. Well, I can see why. We're this close to a breakthrough... that could change medicine forever. Could? Will. Will change. What about proprietary rights? Ours and ours alone. We fund it. We own it. We do with it as we please. The credit, however... it's all yours, along with a great deal of money. I'll need full autonomy, over my staff, the lab, our process... Not a problem. You're the horse we're backing, Edwin. And we're willing to bet big. As soon as we process you through security, we'll meet with Dr. James, get a progress report on the search for Edwin. - How you feeling? - Afraid. Afraid that coming back here was a bad idea. Don't take that off. That'll give you access to most of the compound. Things have definitely changed around here. I remember when security used to be your dad's hunting dogs. Unfortunately, we're learning the hard way... even all this isn't enough. So, Brody... since your folks haven't told you about the Jensen Project, I'll bring you up to speed on our way to meet Dr. James. Okay. Cool. The Jensen Project is one of the premier research facilities in the world. It was founded by my father, the late William Jensen. The Project is a collective of great minds... who not only theorize about ways to improve the world... but actually do it. These are just a few of our more successful projects. Yeah, but, you didn't get credit, other people did. If the group develops, say a... say new vaccines, it's given to an organization like the CDC... or the World Health Organization. They get the magazine covers. At Jensen, the work is the reward. Ingrid, status report. Kendrick James. This is Brody, Matt and Claire Thompson. Kendrick is the head of the Photonic... and Acoustical Engineering Department. He's also our project chief of security. Glad you're here. Ingrid, so far we've got And counting! It is worse than we thought. Biomedical Neuro-cog and Robotics were tapped. Ginny, these are the Thompsons. Hi. And bye. I gotta go see if they also hit A-I. Welcome back to Jensen. Ginny heads up our Computer Sciences division. Alright, let's get to it before things get worse than they are. There is no telling how far Edwin's gone. Oh, what about me? You my dear, are free to roam the premises. Stay out of trouble. No worries. Hurry up  And wait  So close  But so far away  Everything that you always dreamed of  Close enough for you to taste  But you just can't touch  You wanna show the world but no one knows your name  Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it  You know you can if you get the chance...  We know that more than a billion people worldwide... are without access to clean drinking water. As a result, more than 4,000 children in developing countries... die every single day. So, we created this helpful little invention... and gave it to the good people at Pur. It usually takes half an hour in a strainer, but we'll speed things up here. And there you have it! Potentially deadly water is now clean... and ready to drink. The uses are infinite. Non-toxic, water soluble. It can be used to heal a bloody wound during battle... or seal a leak on the space shuttle. You believe and you doubt  If you're confused and got to figured it all out  Everything that you always wished for  Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours  If they only knew  You wanna show the world but no one knows your name  Wonder when and where and how you're gonna make it  You know you can if you get the chance  In your face as the door keeps slamming  Whoa! You're feeling more and more frustrated  And you're getting all kind of impatient waiting  We live and we learn  To take one step at a time  There's no need to rush  It's like learning to fly  Or falling in love  It's gonna happen  When it's supposed to happen  And we find a reason why  Sweet. One step at a time  Brody Thompson... you are not authorized to be in this security zone. Uh, sorry! Sorry! My bad! And we find the reasons why  One step at a time  Whoa! Has anyone gone through Edwin's stuff? What little he left behind... was in his incomprehensible shorthand. It's based on an algorithm. I helped him create it. I was so hoping you'd say that! Sounds like he took a lot of tech. Are you sure he's focusing on nanobots? No, but based on our last conversation, I'm guessing he is. Certainly the most high-profile. And unfortunately, the most dangerous. If there's any good news in all of this, he wasn't able to take our molecular assembler. Your what? He can't produce nanobots without it. And besides ours, there's only a couple of others in the entire world. Well, I guess we should roll up our sleeves. I'm going to need all of Edwin's old files. I'll have them send up right away. You can work over here at this desk. Who's running Immunology these days? You are. At least for now. Our department head took off with Edwin. Can I access lab records too? Absolutely. Come on. I'll walk with you. Monitor. Open files. Next file. I can't tell you how much it means to me... to have both of you back here again. This wasn't easy, you know, for Claire, I mean, not after Edwin forced her to leave. I can imagine. You two ever talk about the time you spent here? That's a subject that's been pretty much off limits... for a long time. Matt, I tried, actually, to stand up to Edwin... on Claire's behalf, but he was absolutely adamant. His behavior that day was... In retrospect, it marked a change in him... that continued until the day he left. This is something you should talk to Claire about, not me. Based on the list you gave me, we've provided all the lab equipment and installs. There's just... one piece of equipment... we weren't able to find. The molecular assembler. But my people are working on that. Well, the sooner we get our hands on one, the sooner I can start producing nanobots. So... what do you think? I think... it's perfect! Excellent! Then I'll leave you so you can get started. Hello? Hello? Oh, now, this... is beyond cool! Huh? Whoa! You are in violation of statute 387564, - breaking and entering! - No... no, I... I was just looking around! - You hacked my security! - You call that security? Uh... yeah! I built it myself! And I cracked it myself, like, in 2 seconds! Well, you're the one hanging upside down! - You're the one who ambushed me! - Who are you anyway? - Who are you? - I asked you first! Look, just let me down, and I promise... I... I... - Save it for the authorities! - No! No! No! No, please! Come on! Just don't call the cops! No! My mom would freak! - Your parents know you're here? - Yeah. They're here, too. My mom used to work here and so did my dad. - No way! - Oh yeah, for real! Matthew and Claire Thompson. You're Matt and Claire Thompson's kid? Well, then... you must be smarter than you look! Next file. Next. Stop. Notes. Transfer file to tablet. Com. Kendrick. Yes, Claire? I found a notation in one of Edwin's files. It's signed "NP". Any idea who that might be? The most obnoxious, egocentric individual... I've ever encountered. I'm not at all surprised that Edwin's up and left. Good riddance! I take it you two butted heads. Ah! Endlessly! Edwin made it his personal goal... to belittle my contributions to the team. I certainly know what that feels like. So I've heard. Let's sit, shall we? Tablet on. I found this diagram of a prosthesis. It has your initials on it. No Jensen project... can move from a theoretical stage to a practical application... without a thorough investigation from my team. The Ethics department, which I head, weighs the implications of all new technology: ethical, moral, philosophical. What about the prosthesis? He wanted to use nanotechnology... to remotely control the prosthetic... through an interface with nerve remnants in the stump. But it caused too much pain for the subject. Edwin thought the ends justified the means. So control the prosthetic, he would control everything: the subject's body functions, brain functions... - Precisely. - Tablet off. That's why Ingrid tabled his research. He appealed to me, but... once Ingrid makes up her mind... Hard to get her to change it. Been there, done that. Despite the bioethical concerns, Edwin was onto something quite remarkable. From what I understand, his work was a continuation of the tech you invented. - Who told you that? - Edwin. He said if you hadn't mishandled it, your work would have been foundational. Hm! I perfected the nanobot ciliary mechanism. Look! Hey, it's remarkable, and you are amazing! If only you had worked... Good news! We found our assembler! - Where? - Laboratoire Tech-Gen. In Montreal? I'm surprised they'd actually sell theirs. Well, they won't. You'll help Ken retrieve it. You're wheels up in 2 hours. I... I... I don't understand. It's simple, Edwin. Ken and his team will break into the laboratory, and you'll identify the assembler. And steal it? You're crazy! I'm not gonna do that. You'll do it, Edwin. Trust me. The people who've paid for all this... won't take no for an answer. Look, I didn't know who you were. Some random stranger cracking my space. For all I knew, Edwin could've sent you. I mean, we are operating at DEFCON 5. You hung me from the rafters, like a smoked ham. And I'd do it again. What's that? - My orb. - Your what? It's what they give you when you become an apprentice. So what's an apprentice do? Every 6 months I rotate to a new department... until I pick a specialty. Right now, I'm with Dr. James in Acoustical Engineering. Wow! I usually have to ditch class... in order to do something that cool. So... where your parents? Gone. Why did Edwin leave? You sure ask a lotta question, dude. - It's Brody. - Whatever, dude. Ugh! So... what did he take? Out of the loop on that one. When I asked Ingrid, she said there are things I don't need to know. That was a first. She never pulled a "cause I said so" card. Lucky you! That's pretty much the only card in my mom's deck! It's not cool! Them keeping stuff from me, it's like, hello? If you're not gonna be straight, what's the point? How we supposed to help each other? Well, don't spaz over it. I mean, in my family, we never share anything important. Gotcha! Follow me. This way. Over here. Let's sit! - Alarm went off on other side. - Now who's pulling this shit... Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Anything? Crones disease, Hodgkin's lymphoma, sickle-cell anemia. Edwin's been doing backdoor studies, on all of these for months. That fits with Ingrid's theory... that he's focusing on nano-med technology. Module up. Research facilities all over the world... put it at least Honey, have you forgotten where we are? This the place where nanotech... Funny how all conversation ceases when we walk into a room. And you are? Samantha Cortez, the youngest apprentice in Jensen history. Pleasure's all mine. Did you know your dad, like, invented the treatment for macular degeneration? You never told me. Ah, old news. - Where'd you find Ms. Cortez? - Hotwiring a car. I caught her red-handed. But... when I warned her that it was impossible... because of its computerization... - she bet me. - And I won. You have a knack for finding sharp ones. Is everything a holograph around here? Looks like an early design for a mobility module, from, like, the '50s or something. Try mid '90s! - This is the neural network. - The brains. Yeah, you can communicate with the nanobot remotely via computer. This is the mobility module... and this is the delivery device. For hormones, vaccines, fluids. This has to be the greatest medical invention ever! Or the worst weapon. This why everyone's freaked out? Because Edwin boosted one of these? - Yes. - What's he gonna do with it? Well, he hasn't got funding, so I guess he's looking for an investor. You mean he's selling it to the highest bidder. Let's not get ahead of our selves, Edwin can't do anything without... A molecular assembler. Three men stole one in Montreal... Look, I don't get why we can't help find Edwin, Dr. James. I know! We can bring a fresh perspective to the search! Yeah. And "fresh" being the operative word in your case. Hm? I know you guys wanna help, but this has become serious business. And, Brody, the last thing your parents need right now... is to be worrying about you. Now, I've gotta get back to HQ. Sam, why don't you take Brody down to my lab. Show him what we've been working on. Come on, dude. It's Brody! Welcome, Dr. Kendrick. Here we go. Found footage of the break-in at the Tech-Gen lab. Look at that image. That's Edwin, all right! So that's it? Yup, the infamous molecular assembler. It's too bad a computer image, is as close as we're ever gonna get... to one of those babies. So... why does Dr. James wear both... a science hat and a security hat? He's got the creds. Worked for the NSA for 10 years... before Ingrid invited him to join the Jensen Project. What's that? Just an experiment. I'm tinkering with sound-frequency isolation. Interesting. This is what Dr. James wanted me to show you: a voice-tracking device. You mean, like a bug? Except it matches voice patterns to digital signals over satellite feeds. - That's awesome! - The way it is now, you need to know where a signal originates or where it's going. With this you can push the search button until you find a match. So, in theory, if we were to track the sound wave of someone's voice, we can figure out their location. The best part is, as long there is a phone in the same room... with the person we're tracking, we can hear them through the phone on both speakers. Even if the phone's turned off? Off, on, in a pocket. It doesn't matter. Watch. I'll upload voice patters of your parents... from some old files. And the software will search the ozone to find a match... and identify the sight of origin. That's so cool! I'll tap into security feeds... at airports and the major border crossings. - Perfect. - Or, we can use the bio passport. To track Edwin? Yes. Everything... cars, people, machinery... leaves a... - Chemical signature. - Excatly. Like a trail. I can mod the bio-passport tech... I developed on the Nicaragua dig... using that, to trace the molecular assembler. And we can use the Montreal transit system... - Exacto-mundo! - Taking that out of shorthand. After 9/11, every major city installed chemical detectors... in their public-transit systems... to... pick up trace elements of hazardous materials, like anthrax. And you combine that, with a bio passport, and you can follow a chemical trail... to the assembler that Edwin stole. So drum roll. What am I looking for? - Silicon. - I need something else... - to mix into the cocktail. - Solvents. Molecular assemblers use solvents to etch gold... - Ah! You said gold! - Gold is used as a conductor. Well, that's all I need. We're looking for a breadcrumb trail of gold and silicon. There's a California joke in there somewhere. Edwin! How was your field trip? - Terrifying. - Well, but... successful. Well, we won't know... until I get the assembler into a clean room and run some tests. Then we'll see if it was damaged... while I was being chased down an alley like a... common thief! As soon as we pinpoint his location, we need to have this team ready to go. Sounds like the computer found my parents. They're trying to find Edwin. So... the computer found my folks. Can it find Edwin, too? Mmm... unlikely. How about if we hook up my gear to yours? Worth a try. Let me pull a voice sample. No, uh... on second thought... What? - Maybe we should just chill. - What do you mean, chill? My parents would freak, if the knew I was doing it. - We're trying to help. - I know... but they already told us not to... - and... - And what? They just busted me for ditching school... for, like, the fourth time. You don't like school? Not so much, no. Too easy? I had the same problem. But... instead of ditching, I kept getting tossed out. You talk to them about it? What? They wouldn't understand. How could they if you don't explain it to them? Camomile. Thank you. Calm your nerves. I keep thinking none of this would have happened... if I'd listened to you in the first place. No one could have predicted Edwin would go this far. Got something here. A private jet, left a Montreal airstrip... at 9:30 last night. At that altitude, the chemical trail will be Gonzo by now. But if we can figure out where it landed, chances are it'll lead us to Edwin. Just got a text from my guy at Homeland Security. He said that that plane from Montreal landed in New Jersey. On it. I'll target New York, Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware. I think I've got something. Trace elements of gold and silicon. That's our cocktail! Okay, backtracking them to... Isolate that right there. - You see it? - Mm-hmm. That's... New York. - The Bronx, actually. - Where in the Bronx? Van Cortlandt Park. Okay, connect this to Dr. James' receiver. - Check. - And... That should do it. I need all department heads, to report to HQ immediately. - What's happening? - Only one way to find out! You think it's a good idea, calling in department heads? It's Jensen protocol. Half of the department heads have mutinied! You can't know who's still in touch with Edwin. You're right. We'll keep this need-to-know. Most of our security is electronic. As you know, we haven't needed much in the way of boots on the ground. And the few we have were handpicked. - And well-trained. - Except in nanotechnology. I may need to go along to secure the data... just in case Edwin decides, if he can't have it, nobody can. Yeah, well, if you go, I go. I'm concerned about how Edwin is gonna react... when he finds out I brought you in on this. Are you worried about, what he'll do to me or I'll do to him? Good point. I wonder if we should've told Brody. No, for now I think the less, the better. I guess you're right. If he knew, he'd be... - As freaked out as I am? - Hey... we don't have to do this, you know. I think we do. I wish I would've known you were such an action hero. I wish you'd asked. Mom! Dad! Where you going? Who are those guys? Did you find Edwin? Are you goin' to get him? Uh... yeah. Would you really do something that crazy without telling me about? - Sweety, we didn't want you to worry. - That worked out well, didn't it? The best way to keep him from sweating it... is to take us along. - This isn't a pleasure trip, guys! - But we can help! You can help by staying here. Folks, we gotta get going. I love you. Back before you know it. I promise. Tell me you're smiling for good reason, Edwin. Well, the assembler's working. We still have to lay out the protocols, go through sterilization techniques. But... rest assured, it's nearly time... to make history. You got the spec yet? It looks like an abandoned water tower. There's an... entrance on the south side. Security system? No... it doesn't look like it. - That's weird. - Yeah. I'll keep you posted. What? You seem so... I don't know. Into this! Beats pulling worms out of noses. What? Nothing. I feel bad about leaving Brody out of the loop. Me too. We should have talked to him before we, you know... Yeah. Well, not talking has become a bit of a habit. I can't believe them! They go all crazy when I don't tell them my every move, and they go do something like this! Yeah, it's pretty messed up, all right. I mean, what am I even doing here? Whining. Stop it. Yeah, well, what do you know? I know that if something happens to them, your life will change instantly! And, dude, you have no idea what that's like! You speaking from experience? I never met my dad, and my mom died when I was, like, 5. Who raised you? Wolves. Come on. Foster care, group homes. It wasn't so bad, actually. It taught me to think and do for myself. So you can pout and mope, or you can off the bench and make something happen! - Like? - Like figuring out... where your parents are. We'll track their chopper. What's that? We left Dr. James' program up. It's been searching for voice matches to Edwin's samples... With the assembler we should have a full chain in 48 hours. - It's Edwin! - Are you sure? Shh! Listen! - What're we supposed to be looking at? - Nanobots. You can't actually see them without a microscope, but trust me, that machine is producing working nanobots, even as we speak. Show me. Show you. Show you what? You said you were producing nanobots. Prove it. Let's see one work. And... and how... how do you propose I do that? By moving into human testing. - Is he kidding? - I don't think so. I will not do that. I don't think my investors would agree. But... if you wanna try to convince them, go ahead. Hm? Are you hearing this? Can you track the guys cell signal and get his location? - I can try. - Do it. I thought I heard something over there. I'll go check. I found your mom and dad. They're just north of New York City, Van Cortlandt Park. - Doesn't make any sense. - What? Edwins' signal's coming from the south end of Manhattan island, maybe... my parents are going. - Double-check it. - I did. What's that? - System lockdown. - We're in lockdown! All communications - are blocked. - Does this mean... we lost Matt and Claire? Completely! No signals in or out! - Where are they? - They'd just reached the site... when we lost them. They're on their own. Everyone can I have your attention? There's been a security breach. Our network has been compromised. We are in self-protect mode, meaning there's no outgoing or incoming communication. This is serious. If our system has been corrupted, we could lose everything. I guess they're not fooling around. A lot of our save-the-world stuff... is a few quick tweaks from kill-everybody stuff. So, yeah, we take this pretty seriously. Ingrid, this is Sam! Can you hear me? I can't get through. Someone's blocked our com to headquarters. We go to get to Ingrid! What about the vents? Can't we climb through them? This isn't a rerun of "Mission Impossible", dude! Grab a flashlight and help me! How'd you know about this? Spilled a bag of malted milk balls a few weeks ago. Couple rolled under the machine. Where does it go? You'll see. Talk to me, Edwin. Well, right now, I'm regulating the patient's blood pressure and sugar levels. Apparently, your man has diabetes. With just a few strokes, I can adjust his blood-sugar level. In case of emergency, I could raise his insulin... to prevent him from going into diabetic shock. Interesting. Give him a shot of serotonin. Slow his heart rate. I don't think that's a good idea. There, you've seen it work. You satisfied? Almost. Once we blast the lock, we'll clear the room. Then go in the door and secure the tech. Now, if there's any trouble, I want you to get back to the chopper. Hurry, dude. Let's do it. - Go! Go! Go! Go! - Go! Clear! - Clear! - Clear! Bring 'em in! I don't understand how the chemical trail led my parents one way... but the voice tracker says that Edwin's somewhere completly different! The point is, we know where Edwin is and they don't! Give him a shot of adrenaline. More. No! Stop! Stop! Stop! His heart can't take any more! Stop! You're gonna send him into cardiac arrest! Don't ever say no to me again... partner. This should lead to a vent outside the building. Wait a minute. I thought we were trying to get to Ingrid. Why are we going outside. We can't get to Ingrid 'cause of the lockdown. We have to switch to plan B. Come on! The server's secure. Do an all-systems roll call, and try to raise Claire and Matt. What is plan B? We don't know how long, Edwin will be at his current location. If we don't go now, we might lose him. Plan B is going after the guy who was just... testing his nano-gizmo on a human subject by ourselves? You don't have to come if you don't want to. Wha... What's that? Five propellers and a fuselage. What do you think it is? An airplane. I knew you were a bright kid. Help me push! Look... do you even know how to fly an airplane? Yeah, kind of. Kind of? No, this is not a good idea! My mom would definitely flog me for this! Your call, but I'm going with or without you. Follow the pretty girl? Obey Mom? Follow the pretty girl? Obey Mom? Follow the pretty girl? Obey Mom? Pretty girl? Mom? Dude! Are you coming or what? Your parents need us! - Definitely. - Okay! Jump in! Ahh! Screaming like a little girl won't help me fly this baby! Uh... Captain to co-captain... "Captain" implies that you actually know how to fly this thing. Chill out! It's just like Nitromaniacs. Nitromaniacs, is just a video game! This is an airplane! And when my mom finds out we stole it... We didn't steal it. It's Jensen property. I'm a Jensen employee, and we're on a Jensen mission. She'll buy that! Oh, I'm so dead! Not if we get back the molecular assembler... and save the world! Trust me, you'll go from juvie to hero in one night. Assuming I survive this... - Hang on! - Ahh! It doesn't make any sense. The trail ends just outside the door. Ingrid! Matt, I'm so glad you're okay. We're fine, but no one's here. - You were too late? - By about 10 years. There's 2 inches of dust on the floor. The assembler's trail leads right up to the door, but no equipment, no people, no Edwin. No, that's impossible. The trail from the airport... led to that exact location. We've looked everywhere, Jenny. It's abandoned. Don't waste any more time there then. Get back here as soon as you can. When we go back, I'm taking the train. Suit yourself, but so you know, I have an instrument rating... and a couple hundred hours logged in that bird. And that's the best you could do? Come on, dude. Let's not keep the bad guys waiting. Okay, it looks like we're all done here. Let's get to the chopper. What's wrong? I know this is gonna sound crazy. I just... I feel so... deflated, somehow. I was so ready to confront Edwin, and now... Most people never face their ghosts. At least you tried. I know what kind of influence... the doubts Edwin instilled in me have had. Not just... on my work, but... on all of us... on the choices we made... for Brody and for you and for me. I just wish... I had been as ready to stand up to him back then as I am now. Yeah, me too. Come on. This one should be it. That's the assembler. There people all around it, including some that look like they eat nails. Let's go. Come here. I re-checked the data again. There were significant traces of both gold and silicon. The chem. trace was correct. This is weird. What? The levels are double the amount, used in the assembler. Ooh! What are you doing? Nothing. Stop being such a dork! - Did you find Brody? - Still looking. - You check Sam's boathouse? - On my way to do that now. Well, you're busy. We'll do it. Ingrid, the lockdown was triggered from the inside. Then it wasn't Edwin. Not unless he left a mole behind. Well, whoever it was, we need to find them now! So what now? Now we figure out how to get to the assembler. Uh... dude? Hello? One second. Ugh! Here. - Ugh! That smells like... - A smart, uh... way to clear a room. Hand me the bottle. What's happening? We have a contaminant breach! Clear the room. - We gotta clear the room! - Let's go! Let's go, come on! Get out! Get out! Hey, put it down! Go! Get out! - Let's go! - Leave! Leave! Let's get going! Come, on. Move! Move! Shut it down! Let's go! And out! Come on, everyone! Let's go! Let's go! Come on, let's go. Looks more like a toaster than a deadly weapon. It's not the machine that's deadly, it's the people who stole it. Grab it and let's get outta here. Let's go! - Got it? - Come on! Do you have any idea what a setback this is? Stop them! - Stop! - Uh! - Sam! - Ugh. Thanks, dude! Ow! Ah! Sam! Sam, catch! The assembler! Get up! Go after her! Go, Sam! Go! And who do we have here? Answer me! My name is Brody. Brody Thompson. Brody Thompson... Hey, guys, are you here? Wow! Cool digs! Ah, this is the last thing we need. Where could they be? Are you kidding? In this place? They could be coming up with an addendum... to Einstein's theory of relativity. I just wish for once he'd let us know what he's up to. Well, we teach by example, honey. We kept him out of the loop. Now he's just returning the favor. Matt? Claire? I've got Sam calling in. Oh... We got the assembler, but I... I... What? How did you... Dr. James' voice tracker picked up Edwin's signal, but... it was during the lockdown and... and... Slow down. Is Brody with you? That's what I'm telling you! These... these guards grabbed me... and Brody jumped in so I could get away... - and... - Sam, where is Brody now? I don't know. Everybody's on it, Claire. We'll find him. We never should've come back here. We never should have left. That day when Edwin... That was the worst day of my life. But this is a million times worse. What have we done...  We left because you were so used to winning, you could not accept a loss. Then you became so afraid it was going to happen again, you got out of the game altogether... and you took Brody and me with you. And yet, you're never willing to talk about it. After we find Brody, things are goin' to change, Claire. They have to. Sorry to interrupt... there's a call coming in. Carry you all the way home...  Put it on speaker. - Mom! - Brody! Are you okay? - Where are you? - I... I have no idea. Are you all right? - Did they hurt you? - No, I'm cool! Appreciate you saving me, dude. I would ground you if I weren't so happy to see you! Mom, I was only trying to help. I know. Sam told us. Next time, though, let's discuss the risks we intend to take... before we take them, okay? - You scared us, man. - I'm sorry. I'm glad you're okay. Are you hungry? You must be starving. No, no, I'm good, thanks. So what happened after I bounced outta there? I have no idea. It's all totally fuzzy. All I remember is waking up on the street. - You made it! - Brilliant! Hey, guys. - He's okay. - Welcome back, Brody. Bio-system alert. Unidentified foreign object. Subject... - Mom? - Brody Thompson. Brody, don't move. - It's Edwin's nanobot. - Inside me? - What has Edwin done? - Taken control of his system. We need to get it out! We need extraction scenarios! Hold on a minute. Everything we do, Edwin will see! Incoming transmission from Edwin Jensen. Answer call. Hello, Claire. Edwin... What have you done to my son? I'm surprised you're back. Ingrid must've been very persuasive. I don't understand why you'd want to hurt... - an innocent... - Ahh! Okay! Okay! Stop! Please! Mom... Now, I'll call you back, one hour, with a time and a place. And you'll bring the assembler. Don't worry. She will give it back. It's linked to his blood vessels. There's gotta be a way to un-link it! Does it feel weird? I didn't even know it was in me until now. Where's the assembler? - Excuse me? - What? I'm sorry, but ethically, this is a classic case... of what's good for the many vs. what's good for one. I think, we need to discuss... - the implications... - Are you kidding me? This is not theoretical! This is my son's life we're talking about! Claire... Let me, please. Ugh! Play files. Next! Next! Play file. We've just witnessed... utter failure. Pause file! I'm not a genius... like the rest of you. My father understood that. My father meant for me to be the heart of the Jensen Project. He depended on me... to make sure that... there would be compassion... in the often-clinical world that we've created here. I failed you. I failed my father. I failed myself. I knew that Edwin... went way beyond the professional that day. He wounded you... personally and deeply. He... was wrong about you. I knew that, and I'm sure that he knew that. I'm so sorry... for then... and for now... And I want you to know, Claire... anything that we can do to protect Brody, we will do. Neeva... would you do me a favor... and run this down to Claire, please? - Send a digital file. - She wants a hard copy. And... to tell you the truth, I really don't trust anybody else right now. All right. - I'll take care of it. - Thank you. - Close topic. - Appreciate it. The algorithms don't match. It won't move out of the heart without tearing the tissue. Maybe if we give him a diuretic... - he can go to the bathroom... - What? - you know. - Won't work. Neither will dialysis. Or plasmapheresis or any execratory that might force... Dad! Great genius talk. I'm sorry. Ingrid! It was Neeva. What? - She triggered the lockdown. - Why would she do that? - She's obviously working with Edwin. - Are you sure? The code that was used to trigger the lockdown... is the same one she used... to call up surveillance cams on her tablet. Where is she now? Neeva! Move! - Outta the way! - Ahh... Excuse me! Excuse me! Neeva! Neeva, wait! Neeva! Right now the Jensen geniuses are busy... trying to come up with a way to remove the nanobot... without my knowing, which is impossible. Yeah. Kendrick figured it out. It was only a matter of time. Are you safe? For now. - Are they gonna trade? - Of course. You left them no choice. Good. If it deactivates, it detaches, right? I suppose. But in order to deactivate it, you need to know how he's controlling it. If it were me... I think I'd develop a phone app! You'd develop the app on your computer? And his computers in his lab! Publicly, Neeva despised Edwin. But, it was all charade. Not only that, from her phone calls over the last couple of months, it appears they were more than just colleagues. I wish we could pause this day and rewind it. And just completely erase it! What did you just say? I don't know. It just comes out. I can't control it. You... You said "pause". Maybe there's a way to pause the program. By temporarily block the signal... that Edwin's using to control the nanobot! - Exactly! - If you meet him for the exchange... he'll need a remote to control the nanobot. We think he's using a phone app, as a remote. Well, that makes sense! So that's the signal we need to block. The mainframe would still control the nanobot. So we shut that down, too. And download the data before we do it! We have no choice. We have to move, even if you get the assembler back. - I will get the assembler back. - They know where we are. It's time. If we work it from both ends, we might have a chance. I can probably re-task a couple of satellites, get you some infrared coverage of that building. It will only work if Edwin leaves the lab to make the exchange. Incoming transmission from Edwin Jensen. Answer call. Behind the Brooklyn Botanical Society. Chinese gardens. Two hours. I assume you'll be there. I'll be there. I never doubted it. Hey. Hey. How you holding up, big guy? It's okay to be scared. It'd be weird if you weren't. What if our plan doesn't work, Mom? - Mom, what if... - Don't do this to yourself, sweetie. Don't think about the "what if". Just focus on the "what is". Look... we have a problem. A big one. But we also have a solution... Okay? And if we... keep our heads... we will get through this. I promise. Troops are gathering. You guys ready? Yeah. Yeah, we're ready. So this works in 2 phases. The program used to control the nanobot was most likely created in Edwin's mainframe. We need to get into his lab, download the program and destroy the CPU. From what Sam and Brody told us, Edwin's computer is located on the second floor. Here. If Edwin gets away and we haven't destroyed it, he will always have control over Brody. Matt, Sam and Brody will go back to the lab. We'll take the XT. - The what? - You'll see. According to Kendrick's sat surveillance, Edwin is already clearing out of the lab. Brody, I mean it this time. You and Sam are there to guide only. This is your dad's show. I will be meeting Edwin in Brooklyn. I will use the assembler to distract him... until we can get the wattage we need... to jam his cell phone. - Ginny... - I'll shut down sectors 7 to 15... to draw the necessary power. And once Edwin's cell phone is neutralized, I'll move in with my team, but not until we reach You are all geniuses. Today's the day to prove it. I am counting on you and your dad... to take care of each other. And I'm counting on you to take care of both of them. You got it, Mrs. Thompson. All right, let's do it. So that's the XT? Huh... I like it! Claire, I've got Matt on the com for you. How's Brody? Spoiling for a fight! I know how he feels. I bet you do. But don't worry! We're gonna be fine. - Keep an eye on our boy. - Will do. Ginny, you got infrared on the building? Yeah. I'm only counting Edwin and his crew are definitely, in get-out-of-dodge mode. Approach from the north-side. There's a maintenance room there. That's where you'll find the main electrical panel. Got it. All right, the com's all set. Hey! Are you OK? All right. Good luck. Okay, we're in. Ginny, Claire's almost in position. I got her. Claire, you copy? - Loud and clear. - Good. We started powering up the wattage. I will let you know the second we have the juice... to jam up his signal to the nanobot. - Okay. - We're in. I see you. How do I get into Edwin's lab? There's a ladder that leads to what looks like decontamination centre, northeast wall of the room that you're standing in right now. Got it. Matt, you've got company. Who are you? Maintenance sent us over to fix the, uh... Okay. That was impressive. I told you she was cool. Okay but, eventually they're gonna know that this guy's missing. And when they do, we're cooked. - So, let's get this done. - How long to search the system? Give us 10. Dad... do you really have to go up there? Unless we download his files before we blow out the system, we'll destroy all the work the Jensen Project's done to create the nanobots, okay? In the right hands, it'll save a lot of lives. - If it weren't for me... - If it weren't for you, we never would have found this lab. I'll be okay, Brody. No one knows me here. They'll think I'm just one of their techs. Yeah. Ten minutes. Ha! Time to tango. Eighty-five percent. Edwin is on site. Got him. Where is it, Claire? How will I know if you disabled the nanobot? Oh, don't waste my time, Claire. You're obviously monitoring your sons' vital functions. After I've inspected the assembler, I'll... I'll send the signal. Kendrick, Ingrid, your husband, they'll all see the nanobot shut down. Now, if you don't mind... Wattage at 90%. Keep him talking. What's to keep you from rebooting the nanobot... once I give you the assembler? Nothing. I literally hold your son's life... in the palm of my hand. You have no choice but to trust me. Trust you? The man who's threatening my child's life? Ninety-five percent. The man who told me my work wasn't good enough... and then continued to develop it? - Trust you, Edwin? - Be careful, Claire. Your own father didn't trust you. That's why he gave control of the Jensen Project to Ingrid... instead of you. Ninety-six percent. Spliced into city power, about a zillion volts. You good to go? Easier than hotwiring a 4x4! Ta-Da! What do you think? I think my dad better be on his game... if we're gonna light this baby up in... Three minutes. Your father didn't doubt your intelligence. He doubted your character. Do you really wanna show the world that he was right? Ninety-eight percent. Stall him, Claire. What are you doing in here? What I want... is that assembler. No! No! Leave it, Edwin! Brody? He's okay. They got Edwin's files and shut down his lab. - I don't believe that. - Well, Edwin... maybe we'll let your friend Cho explain it to you, just as soon as he's finished selling you out to the feds. Edwin, how did it happen? How did you end up here? Brody! Hey. I've been looking for you. - Yeah? - Yeah. I want to apologize. For what? Talking about stuff, you know, our feelings, our fears, it's not always easy, so we avoid it. But in a family, we shouldn't have to do that. I haven't set a very good example in that regard. But I promise, from now on, I'm gonna open up more. And I'm gonna listen better. And I hope you will, too. Yeah, I think I can manage that. And... I... I'm sorry, too. For, like, you... you know... putting you through so much stuff lately. Well, now that that's settled... Ingrid left a message, said there was something I needed to see? Yeah, she wanted me to show this to you. You left this file open. Ingrid was going to archive it... when she noticed this. Play file. That circuit board controls the ciliary mechanism. The nanobot can't function without it. He replaced yours with one that was flawed. He sabotaged my work. Pause file. And then he drove you away... so he could take over your project. Ah... I feel so stupid. - There's no way you could've... - No, I mean, to let that one event... so influence our lives. Close file. I love you. Ah! Ew! Gross! Hey, you better pack your stuff. We gotta take off! What do you mean take off? She means go home. - You're kidding, right? - No. You mean go back to school tomorrow... like none of this ever happened? That's insane! May I suggest an alternative? Thanks to you guys, the Jensen Project can continue... to do its good work. And I hope with all my heart that you'll stay... and contribute your genius to our efforts. What about your practice? I can cure patients one at a time... or find a cure for thousands. Easy call. What about you? This place has always been about... being the best you can be. And I think it's time our family gave that a try. Of course, we're going to talk it over with Brody. Ah, yes! Brody... in the last couple of days, you have shown your own brand of genius. Unfortunately, mostly while disobeying your parents. - But I... - Brody... you risked your life... to protect Samantha and the Jensen Project. So, it is my great pleasure, to offer you... a Jensen Project apprenticeship. So, dude... I mean, Brody... You gonna accept or what? Definitely! Yes!
