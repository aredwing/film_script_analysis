[whimpers] [romantic music] [whimpers] [twinkle sound] Look at that! [both chuckle] [groans] [romantic music continues] [humming] [honks] Hey, Rainy! Hey, there. [alarm clock] [panting] [turns alarm off] I'm tired. [groaning] [chuckling] [groaning] No, Rainy. No! Just one more minute. [groaning] [chuckling] Oh, man! I'm late. [whining] Let me go brush my teeth. [groaning] What would I do without you, boy?. [whine and twinkle] Good morning. Jimmy, sit down and eat some breakfast, please. But I'm late, Laura. Sit down, young man. All my friends are waiting for me. Dad?. Son, you gotta figure out a way to get to bed earlier. But it's a holiday. Do you have money for lunch?. Yeah. Bye. Come here, Rainy. (Laura) That's no breakfast for a grown boy, Dean. I know I 'm not his mother, but you have to be firmer with him sometimes. He'll be fine, doll. Have you told him yet?. No. Honey, it's gonna be difficult enough knowing he has to move. Even more difficult because of Rainy. You need to speak to him. I know. It's just-- It's gonna break his heart. [train horn and rap music] Did you eat your breakfast, boy?. [whimpers] Okay then. I got your favorite snack right here. But remember, Dad doesn't think it's good for your teeth. [rap music continues to play on their earphones] [groans] What's wrong boy?. What's the matter?. (girl) Help! Help me, please! I can't hold on! Help me! Help me! [sobbing] [suspense music] Sharon! We have to do something, boy. [groans] (Sharon) Help me! Help me! [screaming] Hang on, I'll go get help. Jimmy, help! [barking] Help me! [sobbing] [barking] That's it, Rainy! Please, please help me. [groaning] Please Rainy, help me. Help me. Please. Please, Rainy. Grab Rainy's collar! [groaning] (Jimmy) Reach, Sharon! Reach! [groaning] (Jimmy) Closer! (Jimmy) Pull her, Rainy! Good boy. Good boy. [groaning] [triumphant music] (man) Sharon! Over here! Daddy! Daddy! Dad. Rainy saved me. (Jimmy) Good job, Rainy. Dad. Sharon. Oh. Sweetheart, are you okay?. What happened?. I lost control of my bicycle. He saved me. Well, he sure did. He's a heck of a dog. He's a hero. I love you, Rainy. Did you hear that boy?. You're a hero. Now what can we do for Rainy?. How about a big juicy bone?. (father) You got it! I love you, too. [cheering] (man) That dog's a hero! Yee-ha! Hey, Rainy. Look over there. (Jimmy) Did you see that? Hey, can I have one?. (announcer) Jefferson High marching band! Whoo! You're a hero. [several animals howling] [groaning] [whining] [all, meowing] [groaning] [roaring] Dad! Hey, sport. How was your day today, huh?. It was so much fun. Rainy is a star. Hey, Rainy, did you get your errands all done?. [barking] (Laura) Dinner! Come on, boy. Let's go. (Laura) Would you like to say grace this evening, Jimmy? Sure. Thank you Lord for this food, for rest and home and all things good, but most of all, for those we love. Specially, Rainy. Amen. [Rainy groans] Amen. Amen. Well, it sure smells good, honey. You know, Jimmy, we have some exciting news to tell you. We're going on vacation?. Not exactly. But we are going somewhere this coming weekend. Where?. Well, your father got a big promotion. He's gonna be the general manager of a new insurance office in New York City. Isn't that great news?. Does this mean we have to move?. Well, yes it does, sport. You'll love it, Jimmy. It's so much more exciting than here. None of this small town thinking there. But I like Eagle Rock. And what about my friends?. Well, you'll make new friends. Sport, we'll be able to come back and visit from time to time. Well, you boys can. Well, I suppose that'll be okay. Rainy and l are pretty good at making friends. [sighs] [melancholy music] Jimmy, we can't take Rainy. What do you mean?. (Laura) The apartment the company's paying for doesn't allow pets But Rainy's part of the family. Right Dad?. Yes, he is. Then we have to take him. We can hide him, and he'll be quiet and nobody will know. Jimmy, this is very important to your father. We've all made sacrifices so he can get this promotion. Now I don't think we can be selfish about it now, can we? But it's Rainy. We can't leave him alone. Jimmy, we talked to Charlie. He's a security guard at the Fairgrounds and he's agreed to look after Rainy until we find an apartment that allows pets. You called him, didn't you, honey? Y es. And Charlie told me he loves animals. And he promised to take very good care of Rainy until we find another apartment. He promised. No! I won't go! I 'm staying here with Rainy. Come on, boy. Jimmy! I told you! Laura, the boy lost his mother five years ago, And now he feels like he's gonna lose his best friend. It's not so easy for him. [melancholy music] Hi, Mommy. I miss you so much. I have some really bad news. We're movin' to New York City so I don't think I'll be seeing you as much [sniffs] I'm sorry. And the worst thing is, is that Rainy can't come with us. [whining] I wish you could hold me just one more time. Can you please ask God if he can take care of Rainy? I mean, he's a really good dog and I'll be back as soon as I can. Come on, boy. [horses neighing] [several animal noises] It doesn't look like he'll have many friends here. He'll have plenty of room to run around, Jimmy. It's only temporary. Dad, can we please take him?. I'm sorry, son. It's just not possible now. But I promise, I'll find another apartment as soon as we can, okay?. Come on, sport. [funny horn honking] [animal bleating] Well, hello. What can I do for you?. Hi, I'm Laura Warner. I called you a couple days ago about our dog. Oh, yeah. So, where's the animal?. His name is Rainy. Of course it is. Hey, and don't worry. I'll take real good care of him. I got a real nice place for him right inside. Can I come say goodbye?. Well, uh, parish regulations-- Please! He's my best friend in the whole world. All right. All right. You gonna get him?. (Jimmy) Promise to give him leftovers? He especially loves chicken. Sure. Fine. Stay there. Okay. [whimpering] Come on, Rainy. Come on. Let's go. All right, now, put him in there. Could I have a minute with him?. [sighs] Make it quick! [sighs] Guess this is where you'll be staying for now, boy. [sighs] [whimpering] [melancholy music] I'm so sorry, Rainy. I'll miss you so much. [whimpering] But, I'll check in, okay?. Here. This is where we're going. It's New York City. Here's our address. In case you ever wanna come to visit us. Okay?. And I'm also leaving this with you. So, you can play your favorite song and never forget me. [whimpering] Well, I guess that's it. [whimpering] I'll see you again soon. [whimpering] I love you, Rainy. Bye. [whimpering] You okay, sport?. [melancholy music] (Dad) Off we go. (announcer over speakers) All passengers to New York City the train will leave from Platform Five in ten minutes. All passengers to New York City, ten minutes. [train horn] [lively music] (Laura) Look at this. Park A venue, Rockefeller Center, Grand T erminal shopping. This is really so exciting, isn't it, boys?. Well, our lives are about to change for the better. Hey. I got a surprise for you. Season tickets for the Yankees. I love you, Jimmy. You're gonna have to trust me on this. Come on. Try and cheer up, son. I thought we were near TriBeCa. Laura's right, Dad. It looks terrible. Maybe we should find a new place. One that allows dogs. Well, it's probably nice inside. Come on, let's check it out. (Laura) I thought all New York apartments had elevators. Apparently not, dear. Maybe we should go back home. [angry] This is home now, Jimmy! [door creaking] Who are you?. We're the Warners. We're moving in to apartment 12. Oh, yeah. [crunch] This is my wife, Laura. I'm Muriel. This is Reuben. [playful music] Hm. Pleasure. This is our son, Jimmy. We didn't know there would be children. Well, it is in the paperwork. (Muriel) Oh? Hey. So it is. What'd you say your name was again?. Jimmy. (Muriel) Jimmy, are you a good boy? Yeah. You'd better be. (Muriel) Reuben will show you the apartment. (Jimmy) Excuse me. I was just wondering if you allow pets. (Muriel) Pets? Absolutely not. Why?. Have you got a pet?. Y eah. A dog. Rainy. That lease clearly states, in red ink-- We didn't bring him with us. Well good. 'Cause we don't permit 'em. Dogs is filthy animals. Mm-hm. And dangerous. Yeah. Well, Rainy's really clean. And he won't bite anybody. He's the best dog in the whole world. He really is a good dog. (Muriel) Listen to me. The only thing worse than dogs is precocious little kids. Unfortunately, the law forbids me from keepin' them out. Reuben, show them the unit! Right this way. Come on, come on. Oh, I gotta fix that. Wow. Hey, boy. I got my eye on you, boy. [suspense music] I'm watching! I better not see no animals on these premises. [several animal noises] [whimpering] [gasps and chuckles] [cackling] [Rainy groaning to the rap] Wait, what do we have here?. [rap music on earphones] [whimpering] Hey, hey. Now, you won't be needing this now, will you?. [barking] [lively, playful music] Let me outta here! hey! [shouting] Hey, man. Hey. [barking] Stop. Over here, you mangy mutt. Ugh. [playful music] You can't protect him, horse. Move outta my way. [trumpets] [train horn sound] [mooing and pounding sounds] [loud mooing] Holy cow. Holy cow, man. [mooing] You don't wanna hurt, no, you don't wanna hurt nobody Come on, you, you're a loving animal. Peaceful by nature, peaceful. Ugh! [bull mooing] Oh! [loud thump] [farting] [Charlie coughing] Oh, yuck. What did you eat, you stupid bull?. [playful music] Come on. No funny business. Just give me my hat. I'm just needing-- [spitting] Ugh! [bleating] Come on. Ugh. [suspense music] [spitting] [shouting] What?. Why me?. No, nobody makes a fool 'a me. Now come back here, you slow down. It's not fair. [crowing] [several animal noises echoing with circus music] [shouting] Oh, little puppy. Here, puppy. Here, scoundrel. Come here, nice dog. Come out, come out wherever you are. Ugh! [chirping] Stop laughing. [barking] [laughing hysterically] You think you can get away from me that easy, do you?. You got nowhere to go. I'm gonna teach you a lesson you won't soon forget. [barking] Ah! [burps] [Rainy, groaning] No, no. Stay away from-- Yeah, that's right. Run. Run like the scared little animal you are. Oh. Oh. [lively music] [man whistling] [man whistling] [whistling] [starts engine] [whimpering] [groaning] What-- Oh! [train horn] Hey. You can't come in here. T ake it easy, boy. (policeman) He's heading for the train yard, let's go! (policeman 2) Come back here! [blowing whistle] [panting and huffing] [train horn] Hey, look what we have here. Looks like we got another one of us on board, boys. Hey, I'm Derek. Nice to meet you. Welcome aboard. This here is Jojo. Hello. This is Clive. [whimpering] (Derek) Glad to be on board. [train horn] Gotcha now, Derek. [playful music] It's been a long time. It don't look good. That's for sure. I'm in a corner, old boy. What do you think?. [Rainy, whimpering] Hey, what's goin' on?. He's giving me some ideas. That mutt?. [chuckles] If you figure a way to get outta this, I'll give him my dinner. [chuckles] [whimpering] [Derek, laughing] What a move! (Clive) That can't be. Looks like we got another guest for dinner. (homeless men) # Well, I come from Alabama With a banjo on my knee # # I'm going to Louisiana My true love for to see # # It rained all day The night I left The weather it was dry # # The sun so hot I froze to death # # Suzanna don't You cry, whoo # # Oh, Suzanna Don't you cry for me # # I come from Alabama With a banjo on my knee # # I had a dream The other night When everything was still # # I thought I saw Suzanna Coming up the hill # # The buckwheat cake Was in her mouth The tear was in her eye # # Says I'm coming From the South Suzanna don't you cry # # Oh, Suzanna Don't you cry for me # [school bell] Hey, you're the new guy.

So let me fill you in on how things work around here. You need to pay not to get hurt. What?. Got any lunch money left?. No. That's too bad. Ow! [suspense music] See what I mean?. No money, big hurt. Better have some lunch money for us tomorrow, Jimmy. (girl) Hey, guys. Leave him alone. You are all bullies. Ain't that cute? Jimmy's girlfriend is protecting him. I 'm not his girlfriend. But I am telling on you if you don't leave. Boo! Come on guys. Let's leave the lovebirds alone. T omorrow, Jimmy. All right, guys. Are you okay?. Yeah. But, I could have handled myself. Yeah. I can see that. Well, thanks. No problem. I'm Amy. Nice to meet you. Don't think about them. They're just dumb bullies. Like to pick on kids smaller than they are. They wouldn't do this if Rainy was here. Who's Rainy?. My dog. He always came to school with me. Where is he now?. I had to leave him in Eagle Rock. See, we're from Louisiana, but my landlords here don't allow pets That's too bad. He sounds pretty cool. Can he do tricks?. Absolutely. He can roll over, play dead. Even ride a skateboard. Wow. And we love the same music too. I left him my iPod. [lively music] [Jimmy, echoing] This is where we're going. It's New York City. [ship horn] [ship horn] [lively music continues] Hey, Amy. Thanks again for today. You're welcome. But, if it happens tomorrow, maybe let me take care of it. [dog barking] Hey. [dog barking, man grunting] That's my landlord. He's the one who won't let Rainy live with us. [dog, growling] Oh. That hurts! Oh, pup, pup. [suspense music] That's strange. I thought no pets were allowed. That's what they said. Well maybe they changed their minds. I'll check. Okay. See you tomorrow. [lively music] (girl) Somebody lost a dog. (woman) He's so cute. (man) Hey, watch where you're walkin', you. (man) Hey, hey, come here, buddy. [pleasant music] [chuckling] (girl) What a cute doggie. [suspense music] [gasps] [barking] Help! help! (lady) Somebody stop him! Get outta the way. Get outta the way. [barking] Police comin' through! Get outta my way. Get outta my way. Ugh. (thief) Hey, get him off me. (policeman) You're under arrest, pal. (policeman 2) Come on. Get up. Stealin' purses from little old ladies, huh? Mangy mutt! Thank you, officers. My whole life is in this bag. Don't thank us. The dog caught the thief. Mangy mutt. (policeman) You're a mangy mutt. Come on. Oh, what a good dog you are. Who's your owner?. Let's see your collar. [groaning] Oh, my, you're halfway uptown. That's a long way home. Come. I'll take you back. Come on. [whistling] Let's go. [whimpering] (Reuben) 'Cause I don't wanna get rabies. I, I'm not thi- How many times do I have to tell you?. don't look the animals right in the eye. It' makes them mad. Well, the damn thing bit me, Muriel. Oh, it nipped you. It didn't even break the skin. Uh, Ms. Ledger?. Somethin' wrong, kid?. Well, I just wanted to ask you about my dog again. I told you, no pets allowed. Well, I saw Mr. Reuben bringing in a cage with an animal in it I thought maybe you just changed the rules. Why are you nosing around, kid?. Are you one of those troublemakers?. No, I just thought maybe-- No pets! Now get outta here before I talk to your parents. I'm always careful not to be seen. You idiot. Now get up here and make me a sandwich. I think we're outta Miracle Whip. (Muriel) Well, you better make a miracle and get some. [sirens wailing] Come on. It's your building. [horns honking] Young man! (man) Let's go, I ain't got all day. Young man! [horns honking] [shouting] Do you live around here?. Do you live around here?. Uh, yeah. Well, I am trying to get this nice doggie home. And his collar says that this is his building. Here?. No way. Why not?. You see, I know the landlords of this building, the Ledgers. They're as mean as snakes. They don't like kids and they hate animals. They do?. Oh yeah. There's no way they're gonna let a dog, even a cool dog like this one stay here. I'm sorry. Thanks. Well, it seems like we're not having any luck. And I have to go. Maybe your owners are keeping you secret. Sh. [whimpering] Can you stay here and wait for them to come home?. [whimpering] You are such a good doggie. Thank you very much. [whimpering] (Dean) Hey guys. (Laura) Hi, honey. Hi, Dad. How was your first day in the new school, sport?. Nothing special. (Laura) You see, I told it would be just like Eagle Rock. Just like. Hey, did you make any new friends today?. Just one. Great. What's his name?. How come the landlords are allowed to have pets, but we can't?. Well, I wasn't aware that he had any. I saw Mr. Reuben bring in a cage with an animal in it. It even bit him. Jimmy. I was in their apartment today, and I didn't see any dogs. But I saw him. And I asked them too. And what did he say?. No pets allowed. And what else?. Stop being nosy. You see? There you have it. We must stop all this talk about dogs. We're in New York now and it's not gonna change. [melancholy music] Wish you could be here, Rainy. It's not much fun without my best friend. [sniffs] God. If you could only find a way. [melancholy music continues] [all chuckling] (punk 1) Hey, look at this guy. Hey, what you got there, old man?. Huh?. Hey, hey, stop. Come on, man. What is this, trash?

[engine roars] No, no, no! [barking] (valet) You can't drive that car! [brakes screeching] Come back here! [lively music] [horns honking] [cheering] [lively music] [brakes screeching] (man) It's a dog. [lively music] Rainy?. [melancholy music] Just a dream. Now listen, sport. You can't miss the bus everyday. You understand?. [Dean, whistling] Taxi! T axi! [whimpering] [continues whimpering] [suspense music] [horn honking] [brakes screeching] Okay, hey. Have a great day, Jimmy. You too, Dad. [grunting] Love you. [school bell rings] [school bell rings] [suspense music] Jimmy, boy. Where's our money?. I brought my own lunch today. Maybe l could give you a cookie. You tryin' to be funny?. No. (Billy) You tryin' to make fun of me? No. Then you must be stupid. Stop! Hey, let her go! Leave her alone. I'm gonna teach you a lesson. First just-- Let her go. You gonna cry like a baby?. Rainy! (Jimmy) I can't believe it. (all) Ow! Ah! Oh! Ow! [cheering] [barking] Please. Please. Get him off me. [barking] Get him off me! [groaning] [cheering] Now look who's crying like a baby. [cheering] I can't believe you came back, boy. [whimpering] I missed you so much. [whimpering] [both laughing] Rainy, this is Amy. Amy, Rainy. (Amy) Pleased to meet you, Rainy. Come on. Or we'll miss the bus. [both chuckling] (Jimmy) I think he likes you. He's very cool, Jimmy. Yeah, but, I don't know what to do with him. You should tell your parents. I can't. My stepmother will freak She doesn't want to lose our apartment. (Amy) He sure is a great dog, Jimmy. I can't lose Rainy again. (boy) He's so cute. We'll figure something out, boy. I promise. (Amy) See you tomorrow. (Jimmy) Bye, Amy. Thanks again. She's a good friend. I can't take you upstairs, boy. What can we do?. [groaning] Come on. Let's go, boy. [pleasant music] Hey. This might lead inside. [kicking] Ugh. [groaning] We'll have to keep you here for now, boy. Come here, boy. Lie down. [groaning] Here. Eat this. I'll come back with more food and water later. You have to be very quiet. Okay?. [groaning] Sh. Well, have sweet dreams. [door opens] (Muriel) Now don't mess this up, Reuben. I want to get rid of one of these birds. You hear me? They stink to high heaven, flappin' their little wings all the time. And that one is a vicious gossip. Chit-chattin' all the time. Don't mess this up, Reuben. [birds chirping and playful music] This is gonna make my client very happy. Y eah. What'll he fetch?. Two thousand. Nonsense. More. Maybe. Maybe, twenty-five hundred. I won't accept a penny less than three thousand. [squawks] Don't be cheap, don't be cheap. Okay. It's a deal. I'll come back tomorrow and pick up the bird. Ah, ah. Payment first. And three. Beautiful. [squawks] Take a hike. [squawks] Shut up, dummy, shut up. No, you shut up. I'll fry you up and serve you on toast. I feel sorry for such a wonderful creature. Don't be an idiot, Reuben. We're gonna be rich. Come on. Let's go upstairs and roll around in it. (parrot) Reuben, get me a cheeseburger. With fries. [squawks] [playful music] [squawks] Don't leave me hanging. [squawks] A doggie. [squawks] Prison break. Prison break. [parrot squawks] Freedom, baby. Freedom. [squawks] [playful music continues] Hasta la vista, baby. [squawks] [barking] I'll be right down. [barking] Where's the bird?. He was here last night. Where's my bird?. He's not here now. No, it's not. Reuben, go check the other cages. Right, sweetheart. I'll look everywhere. They're here. I think they're all here. So what?. So I find it hard to believe that someone broke in here, last night with all these other animals here and only your bird got stolen. What are you saying?. I think you know what I'm sayin'. This is ridiculous, huh?. I want my money, and I'm not doin' anymore business with the two's 'a you. Reuben, call the police. Right. But sweetness-- If I call the police, they're, they're gonna lock us all up. Admit what you did. No! Admit it! This whole time you-- (Muriel) What in the world is this? No, no, no, no, no, no, no! These don't look like little kid prints. These look like the kind of prints of some kind of dog. (Seagal) You hear me?. I want my bird. (Muriel) When I find-- Oh, it even chewed a hole. I can't believe this! [growling] I knew it. That Warner kid has a dog. Come on, go get it. Go get it. Good, yeah. Come here. But pets aren't allowed. That mutt must'a done this. I'm gonna go have a little chat with his parents. (Dean) It's a little hard to believe. I mean, I know Rainy is a very smart dog. But I can't imagine him travelin' 2000 miles to this city to find Jimmy. Sounds like a movie. I am warning you. Your lease specifically states, no pets. If I find a dog hiding in here, you are out! (Laura) Please, Mrs. Ledger. We don't want any trouble here. Well, it's too late for that! (Dean) Now wait a minute. Now, there's no evidence that we have any animal in this apartment at all. So, until you can produce such evidence, I'll thank you not to threaten my family. Oh! [roars] [crunching] It's okay. I guess I should go. Sweetness. (Amy) What did you bring?. For what?. Uh-oh. You forgot?. That's not good. Mr. Newman said anyone who didn't bring a show and tell gets an F. Maybe he won't call on me. Here, take mine. No way. You'll get an F. [clears throat] Mr. Warner. Is there something you'd like to share today?. Uh-- Uh-- l-- Mr. Warner. [knocking on door] Come in. [rattling drums] [children exclaim] What is the meaning of this?. Who does he belong to?. (Jimmy) Uh, he's my show and tell, Mr. Newman. Well, this is a bit irregular, but go ahead. [pleasant music] (girl) He's talented. Rainy. Come on. [groaning] [children chuckle] Just in time, boy. [groaning] T oday, I wanna tell you about the German Shepherd dog, one of the bravest, and smartest breeds there is. Looks like a stupid animal to me You would know. [Rainy growls, children laugh] Gentlemen. Continue Jimmy. In fact, Rainy's so smart, he got invited to train for a search and rescue team in the great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. Once, he even saved a pilot's life. Oh, so now he can fly?. [children chuckle] Billy. Let him finish. So about a year ago there was this pilot flying over the Smoky Mountains. [pleasant music] [alarm sets off] (Jimmy) Suddenly, he started to have engine trouble. [suspense music] Mayday. Mayday. (pilot) Losing oil pressure. Rapidly losing altitude. Mayday. Mayday. (Jimmy) It was gonna be a real dangerous emergency landing. H is wheels touched down, and the plane landed in the ice and snow. And Rainy was there [groaning] (Jimmy) The pilot set the plane down safely, but passed out. [barking] (Jimmy) Rainy pulled him out just in the nick of time. [pleasant music] [groaning] He won a medal for that too. The end. Now that was an A-plus presentation. Good job, Mr. Warner. (girl) He's so cute. (girl 2) I wanna pet him. Thanks, boy.
