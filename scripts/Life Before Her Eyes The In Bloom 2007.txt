'Cause Jenkins is, like, five feet behind me. Oh. Sorry. Why are you always mad? Because you make me mad. Just once, I would love-- Okay, can we just please stop talking about it now? Sure. Fine. Who was that girl in the office with you? Maureen? She's cool. Today was the first time we really talked. I like her. Oh, good. We can play together then. So guess what? - What? Nate asked me to go to the movies with him. Oh, my God. A second date, and you didn't tell me? Well, he just asked me in Trig. Well, I'm gonna come as your chaperone and make sure nothing untoward happens. Mm, that's okay. We can double-date, if you want. Bring your professor. Yeah, right. Did I tell you I've been calling him? No. - Yeah. But I keep getting his stupid machine. He's got, like, a hundred messages of me just calling, and freaking out and hanging up. When is it all gonna start? When is what gonna start? Our lives. Not all of this. You know what you should do? Buy him a frozen yogurt. Mm, that's what I did with Nate, and I got a second date out of it. I have to go to the bathroom. we're gonna be late for class. Sorry. Okay. So if we're, like, percent water... then that's kind of like there's no boundaries. I mean, people think skin is just this thing, like rubber, but it's not. It's just more water. Are you high? You are so high. You are, like, Life is my drug, Maureen, so-- Okay, then let me see your purse. We are so styling. Yeah. By Briar Hill standards. No, objectively. We are. By any standards? Well, unless we're in New York or Polynesia-- - Or Hawaii? Or some other place we should go. I have to start working on Mom now. Good luck with that. Do you realize we're old enough to get married? Maybe we should go to college first. Yeah, I'm saying we could if we wanted to. You need your parents' permission. All right. Just so long as you know that you and Nate can just drive to Vegas-- Except that I don't want to. But if you did... You know, if the Church doesn't let you, uh... ...before you're married. Yeah, well... What is that? What? - Do you hear that? Hang on. I can't hear anything. What the hell? Dee, don't. It's probably just some stupid prank. Come on. Go, go. I bet Ryan decided he hasn't been a big enough asshole for the past-- Oh, my God. Stop shooting! I know who it is. It's Michael Patrick. What? Yesterday in Trig, he told me he was gonna bring a gun to school, and he was gonna kill... - Who? Everybody. "All you fuckheads." You know, what a freak. Didn't tell anybody? I thought he was just kidding. Maybe they stopped him. Shh. Michael, no. No. Mr. McCleod. No! Hey. Michael? Diana. Michael, don't kill us, please. Please. Diana! Diana! How are you? Okay? I'm fine. Because... I know. I just have to keep it together this week. I'll be fine. Mommy. Hm. Where are you? Mommy. It's not even remotely amusing. Hm. Where's my little girl? Is my little girl in there? Boo. What are you doing? You're gonna be late for school. And don't make me tickle you. Can we go hiking, Mommy? Maybe in the summer. Can I have a cheese toast? I made oatmeal. Oatmeal? Why oatmeal? I hate oatmeal. Come on. Come on, You okay? Have a good day. - Yeah, I will. Can we go hiking in the summer, Daddy? Mm, in the yard, sure. No. In the woods. - Ha. Give me a kiss. Mwah. Bye. Bye, Daddy. I spy with my little eye something beginning with... C. Um, C. Uh, cars? Nope. Hm. Child? No. - Hm. Got me there, Emma. Cougar. Cougar? Hm. That's a tough one, Em. What's a conscience? Where'd you hear that? Dad was talking to himself... in his study. It's complicated. Not today, Emma. # Trying to find her She's not there # MAN This week, of the tragic date, a memorial at Hillview High School honoring both the victims and the survivor-- Your lunch is in your backpack. Oh, Mom. Please. Shall I come in with you? Come on. Good morning. - Come in, children. Okay. - Okay. Give me a hug. Mm. Be good. Emma. Come on. Don't run, girls. Hey, Amanda. - Hey, Diana. Hey, Amanda. - Hey, Diana. So are you going? I saw the bleachers in the street. Mm. I don't know. I'll think about it. It comes out in strange ways. What do you mean? Bethany told me that Emma's been getting in trouble in school again. Not that I'd worry. I mean, you were pretty wild. I remember when you got arrested for kicking that boy in the nuts. I didn't get arrested. That nun just gave me a dirty look. Is it possible that nothing changes in this town? Except you. Hey! Hey, Diana. Hey! Oh, get the fuck off me. What the fuck is the matter with you? Fuck do you think you are? You're just a fucking dirty little slut-- Shit. You have two seconds to wipe that smirk off your face. Fuck you. I mean... I was really into it and I turned around, and he'd pulled out his... you know, and I was so pissed. You think coral isn't alive. Like, it's a rock. But it's alive, you know. It's a living thing, with a brain. And I just felt like I was so close to... something. Maybe I was just high. I don't know, but... now I can't take goddamn Driver's Ed because they found me with pot. Like, big fucking deal, you know? Oh, what are you gonna do now? It's like I told Officer Petersen, I solemnly promise to take a break from the pot. But I can't make any promises about kicking men in the nuts. I mean about Driver's Ed. I can teach you how to drive. Okay. So, uh, The one on the right is the gas, and the one on the left is brake, okay? Mm-hm. Yeah. So, that, just-- Okay. Yeah, okay. Um... - Is the car on? Ah. Okay, yeah. Sorry. Sorry. - Okay, careful. You'll ease. - In drive? Ease? - Easy. Turn-- - Ease on the brake. Okay. I got it, I got it. - Okay, just-- Right. This is back-- Where's the signal? Um, the left. No, just-- O-okay. Keep one hand on the wheel-- I got it. I got the wheel. I just need to know where the blinkers? Can we go on the road yet? Uh... - I'm so ready. Uh, just watch the steering. Please. - Why? Is that, Dee. Jesus Christ, lady. What are you doing? You scared me. - Why don't Mr. McCleod. Okay. Uh, so what do we know? We know, for example, that Stephanie here was a-- A teenager. We know that, because of the narrowness of her pelvic bones, and also because there are these gaps in her pelvic region, where an older human female's bones would be fully-formed. That is, there are parts of the human female body that do not ossify. Meaning? Amanda? Um, turn to bone? Right. Until after adolescence. So when Stephanie died, that was all still soft tissue, and it just melted away, which is actually called... decomposition. So, of course, bones decompose much, much later than soft tissue and all the rest of the flesh. Do you think Mr. McCleod He totally blushed. I feel bad. Although you did use ossify in a sentence. Oh. It couldn't hurt. I got a C on the midterm. I could do with a good class grade. Anyway, you know there's something going on between him and Stephanie. Hm. The teenaged skeleton? A little note can't change the love they have. Okay. Hold on a sec. Ah. There we go. Huh. The Breton nuns can see Jacob wrestling with the angel. Are they imagining it? Are they having a genuine visitation? Or...given the consistency of the painted work, the lack of distinction between the two parts of the image, is it fair to say... that Gauguin doesn't believe in any demarcation-- Diana? 12:35. heh --between the real and the imagined? Has anybody seen Anna? You're gonna come, right? No. My mom won't let me go. What? Why? I don't know. Quote: She's "not crazy about teens writhing around on the ground and seeing things." Don't get pissed. Just telling what she said. I know what I saw. It was real. A vision of God. Things froze. Everything just froze. Sounds like you got hit by a car, or you fucking passed out. You see it, you see it. What if you don't? I mean, Briar Hill is nice and all, but-- Shut up. You hate Briar Hill. I don't know. Is it really the kind of place that...you can see infinity, or whatever? We should probably get started. It's too hot for homework. See, Maureen. How could we have done Trig without cooling down? So wise. Oh, shh. Grasshopper. You have much to learn. For what is trig, when there's an early show to catch? Mm. Hey. Come on. Hm. This is the life, M. It's not our life. Heh. They're on vacation. They don't care. The Penzers aren't on vacation. Their grandmother died. Are you gonna spend the afternoon worrying? They can't arrest you for swimming in a pool. Who's gonna report us? Some old bag of a neighbor? It's just the mailman, you spaz. When I was a little kid, I used to love hanging out in the rain. Drive my mom nuts. But I'd watch the flowers. Some would get crushed, but some would burst back up after. So cool. I have no fucking idea what you're talking about. Rain. You know, it's produced when water condenses, or something. Maybe we're just like the rain when it evaporates. You know, like, we just go back into the atmosphere? 'Cause look at all this mist. I wonder who we're breathing in right now. Ew. Okay, speaking of "ew," my mom's new boyfriend. How is the new boyfriend? His name is Raoul. Oh. My mom dated a Raoul. Is he like Moby but Spanish? Oh, God. Let's just hope we don't end up on the Briar Hill singles scene. I wonder where Nate lives. I think over there. You mean, with the fancy people? Dude, you could have a porch. Happy days. Good night. - Good night. MAN The mother cougar will protect accompanying them everywhere until they're old enough to defend themselves. Emma... what are you watching? Magic School Bus. Really? You shouldn't be watching this, Emma. It's funny. It's just like a joke. It's not a joke. And if I ask you something-- You shouldn't be so scared, Mommy. Don't be scared. Oh, shit. Mommy said a bad word. Shit. Oh. I have some good news. Hm? Are we getting a pony? No. - Mm. Should I continue? Say it. - All right. As you may know, every four years the faculty chooses from its ranks an individual of outstanding academic reputation to deliver a lecture in honor of the college's founding president, Arthur M. Fuller. Oh, this year... the Arthur M. Fuller lecture is going to be delivered by none other than... your faithful servant. Heh. That's amazing. Do I have to go? Uh-- Do you have a title? Well, I've been thinking of: "The Problem of Evil, The Problem of Good..." but, you know, we'll see. Think you might need some case studies? Because, um... I happen to know someone that was... extra...bad this afternoon. Hm. Of course, to use her in my presentation... I would need her under glass. Mm. Emma? Emma? - Sweetie? Here, sweetheart. Come on. - Come on. Paul? - Sweetie? Come on, babe. Come on. Paul? Come on, cough it up. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You can breathe. Breathe, breathe. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay, you're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Maybe I'll be too sick to go to school tomorrow. Maybe. We'll see. I hate school. No, you don't. Yes, I do. I hate it. I hate Sister Beatrice. Well, Sister Beatrice-- No. I hate homework. I hate it all. I fucking hate school. Don't say that. - Why? It's true. 'Cause it's like something Michael "Dickwad" Patrick would say. Touch. Come on, let's go inside. Here you go. I've been worried Hiding games she plays. The other day she said to me: "Mommy. You can't make me do anything." It's just like me. I don't think I even started that young. You were pretty young when I met you. I got a note again from her teacher at school. Well, you're the one that wanted to send her to that parochial school. Mm. Dee... tonight... are you gonna try and get some sleep? If you don't sleep, you don't dream. Maureen and I used to live in the shitty part of town. Ha. And we dreamed about having a nice house... with a porch. Close your eyes. Keep your eyes closed. Okay? Give me your wine. Here. All right? Stand right there. Get a little forward. Right there. Mm-hm. - Okay. Keep your eyes closed. Okay. You can open 'em. It's so beautiful, Paul. Hey. Michael. Diana. Michael, don't kill us, Us? No, I'm only gonna kill one of you. You don't have to kill either of us. Well, I'm going to. The on-- The only question is... which one's it gonna be? You don't have to, Michael. Please. Come on, girls. It's time to choose. Mommy. I had a bad dream. Read it, Mommy. It's the only one that helps me. When the voices of children Are heard on the green And laughing is heard On the hill My heart is at rest Within my breast And everything else is still Then come home, my children The sun has gone down And the dews of night arise Come, come, let us play And let us away Till the morning appears in the skies No, no, let us play For it is yet day And we cannot go to sleep Besides, in the sky The little birds fly And the hills are all covered with sheep Well, well Go and play Till the light fades away And then go home to bed The little ones leaped and shouted And laughed And all the hills... ...echoed Why does it have to be All right, wait. Hold up. Hold up. Check this out. Um... you know, uh, Timmy there, he's part wildcat. Bullshit. - No, he is. He is. See his ears? How they--? Just like hers. Just like me. Ow. Ha-ha-ha. Mmm. Mm-mm. Come on, guys. Did you see Said I would wait for you. You could have come inside. Hey. So how was it? Did anybody talk in tongues today? Well, we prayed... and we felt a great rush of the Holy Spirit. So...that's cool. Mm. Myself, I fucked my older lover in the pool. Do they talk about heaven in your Church? Pretty much exclusively. 'Cause I know Wait, it wasn't the pool that we swim in, right? Dee? Dee? I can't believe this. That's so gross. What? Would you look at us: the virgin and the whore. If you listened to Mrs. Goldman, we're like the whole of female art history in this room. Or we could be, like, this fall on the WB. Nice. You made a joke. Shut up. M, you are so beautiful. Come on. - Serious. Nate is gonna think you're so hot. Houston, the genie has left the bottle. Yeah, I think she's going back inside. Give me my dress. No, look-- All right, can I just get a picture first? Fine. - Yes. Okay. No, no, no. Forever on film. We have a week to go... but...it is the end of the year. I know some of you I... won't be seeing too much of over the next few days. Uh...but I-- I did want to say how much I've enjoyed teaching you guys. And if there's anything I want you guys to take with you... from this class, as you're abusing your bodies over the break, uh, is three things. That the heart... is the body's strongest muscle. That the brain... has more cells in it than our galaxy has stars. And that the body... is 72 percent water. So wherever you go over vacation... don't get too dehydrated. Uh-- Excuse me. One second. Would you care to talk to me? Sure. What's up? McCLEOD: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Um... McCLEOD: I've got the stuff here. Sure. Who did this? You kids. There's gonna be a test next week. And it will affect your GPAs. Everything we've done this semester. I-- I just wanted to say that I learned a lot in your class this year. So...thank you, Mr. McCleod. You remember the Bernoulli principle? Ha. We already have three things to remember over the break, so-- All birds need to fly are the right-shaped wings, the right pressure and the right angle. You have the wings. You're supplying the pressure? I just think you need to change your angle. Ahem. Reading minds are more your thing than birds and bones. Like, this guy, Paul McFee is a terrific speaker. You write me up a short report, and I'll give you the extra credit. Okay? How's that sound? You still have to take the test. Where Did We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? Why did Gauguin pick this title for such a bizarre and beautiful painting? Anybody? Anna. Um... wasn't he trying to work out a new way of answering those questions? That's exactly right. And using Polynesian shape and color as an inspiration, he wanted to break through what he thought of as outlived and conventional ways of asking. That's a good answer. It was in the reading. Well, you did the reading. All right. That's it. I would very much appreciate it if I could have all your papers on Friday so I can grade them. Anna. Can you stick around for a minute? Thanks. By Friday. Be much appreciated. I think you have more potential than you realize, Anna. With your grades, you could get into a four-year college. I just-- I have a boyfriend in town, so... You may think you'll never leave this town, but you just have to give it a chance. No, I don't think so. Life's too short. So unfair. Just 'cause Ryan called the skeleton a slut. What did he say again about the body's strongest muscle? You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I don't know how to say this. Just say it. If every time somebody says that word, you get angry or assume... Go on. If it hurts you, then...I don't understand why you act the way that you do. Heh. Like a what? Like a tramp? Forget it. Like a round-heeled woman? A hussy? I can't really think of a word. I don't understand what you're get-- So I guess I can't teach you how to drive anymore? Shh. What do you think? You think if Nate asks you out you're just gonna drive around the block? No. "Hey, Maureen, I like you. "Let's go drive around the block a couple times, "and then get married and, I don't know, wait for the rapture." That's so unfair. Well, get real, Maureen. You don't understand how things really are. You think you could say no to the whole fucking world? It's not there to say no to. Slut. Diana Adams. This is the last time. The heart. The heart is the body's strongest muscle. You know what I love about you, Dee? That I'm 17? No. That you're not afraid. And that I'm 17. Yeah. Come on, girls. It's time to choose. If you're gonna kill one of us... kill me. Oh, Maureen. And what do you have to say? Maybe... Maybe I should kill you? No. No what? No, don't kill me. But if I don't kill you... then who should I kill? I don't deserve this. Hey. Wanna drive around the block a couple of times and then wait for the rapture? If you don't let me teach you how to drive, you'll never get out of Briar Hill. Say you're sorry. Say you're sorry. Okay, we'll say it at the same time. Three, two, one. Sorry. Got you. Very mature. Yeah. I think his parents and this one has two initials. Or maybe I could just, like, talk to him in Bio. Look, M-- Heh. I know that you and Nate are gonna have, like, eight kids and be one of those perfect creepy Christian families that live happily ever after. Hey, I don't know about you, but I could do with some soup. How'd you do on that test? I did okay. I got the one about the heart. I don't really think that's true, though, Maureen. About it being the strongest muscle. I don't think in my case Oh. It's okay. It's okay. Maureen? Shit. What is it? What's wrong? Dee just messed up her English test. I didn't know what the human condition was. Well... you will soon enough. I didn't know you were allowed to lie. Heh. Here. Emma. Mommy. Mommy's right here. Mrs. McFee. Sister Beatrice. You understand why you're here? No. I-I don't understand why I'm here, to be honest with you. Your daughter is, uh-- She's very bright... but she's a handful. My daughter's not a handful. She's smart. She's spirited. She disappears... and she hides. So I was thinking And I-- I don't know. If I just had this normal life, you know? Yeah, with a husband that didn't leave? Right. But if I met someone-- Nate. And had kids and... even if I stayed in Briar Hill, um, that might be enough? You-- Heh. --probably think that's really stupid. No. Yeah. Hey, Cody is a pretty cool name. Ugh. Jennifer is nice. Bethany. Emma. Amber. I like Emma. You keep Cody. I'll take Emma. Thanks. I wanna go swimming. Well, just go to the public pool. No. There's all those... little kids. This isn't really ice cream. Frozen yogurt's better for you. I can see my little girl in there. You do understand why Mommy was mad, don't you? You hate me. I don't hate you. You're always mad at me. In the car, you were looking at me. It's just because you're so beautiful, sometimes... Mommy can't help but to look. That's not why. Emma, you have to promise me. No more running away, no more hiding. I swear on my life. It's not funny, Emma. But it is funny. Goddamn it. You have two seconds to wipe that smirk off your face. Mommy said a bad word. That's it. We're going to talk to Daddy. No. Ow. You're hurting me! Stop it. Ow! Ow! PAUL You've reached Paul McFee at the Department of Philosophy. In his terrible absence, please leave a message. Why don't you come in? I didn't bring my trunks. Diana? Help over here. Diana? Dee? Dee. Are you okay? Um. I'm okay. Where is she? Who? Diana? Can you sit? Let's just get her off the road. Don't move her. Wait for an ambulance. I'm okay. She's okay. He missed me. Just go on in, honey. Sit up there. Cool. Type and Rh? O-positive. Mm-hm. What's the hemoglobin? Twelve grams. Did we doc C-cycling? Mm-hm. Just make sure she gets the post-procedure meds. Yes, doctor. Okay. Uh-huh. Right, okay. So is it--? Is it normal? Uh-huh. Oh-- Yeah, but I-- What did they say? I don't understand a fucking thing. So... Do you have, uh... like, lemonade or something sweet? Yeah. If this gets any worse, we're gonna have to go to the hospital. Huh. So...? I'm fine. I can take that Blood freaks me out. I'm sorry. I wish I could do something for you. I want your cat. All right. Okay. You must have moved just in time. There was all this blood. You're lucky he missed you. I never got drunk before. Oh, my God. Do you think he's waiting for a girl? We should wait and find out. Oh, we're gonna miss the movie. So what? No girl. Is that him? Marcus? - Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Please. Yeah, I can do that. I can do that in, like, a half hour. Yeah. Yeah, hold on a second. Hold on. Hey. Hey. How's, uh--? How's Timmy? Good. Cool. Cool. There you go. Yo. No, it's not. No, dude. Trust me. Nah, it's just some slut. Don't think about it. So...are you up for a truly hard question? Goobers or mints? Maureen, what did I do to deserve a friend like you? Um, something in a past life? Do you believe in that? I don't know. Maybe. I mean...we have to go somewhere, right? # Please don't bother Trying to find her # And there was...so much blood. And...he was such a-- A pussy? # The way she looked The way she acted # Yeah. Such a pussy. So lame. # Her eyes are Clear and bright # And the blood was-- # She's not there # Can we change this music? Sure. Mom still at work par usual. M, I really don't wanna grow up to be one of those women. You know, one of those hard women that are angry about everything all the time. I know. With a heart like yours, heh... I don't think you're in any danger. Get out of here. Bye, M. - Bye. DIANA What's her name, Paul? Who is she? There's only one girl for me, and her name is Diana. I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Is that your powerful conscience talking? Maybe we should send you to parochial school. Diana. Oh. That's all right. Hm. I so loved you. I so loved all of it. I thought if I lived a certain way... cared for my daughter... helped my students... loved you... then I could make everything all right. What? You can't understand. No, I don't... understand. I-I'm your husband. You're not my husband. It is my great honor to introduce one of the most distinguished members of our academic community, Professor Paul McFee. Thank you. Thank you. It is one of the great honors of my life to be asked to deliver this year's Arthur M. Fuller lecture. William James... that most American philosopher, once advised: "Begin to be now what you will be hereafter." One might ask how? Our deepest guide in our beginning to be is imagination. Our ability to project and mold our future selves from the myriad possibilities before us. And to imagine takes courage and effort... but it gives us hope too. Hope that we can author our own destinies. Hope that the rightness of the decisions we make now will be borne out in the future. As much as we can be overwhelmed by the world, we can also draw hope from it. From beauty. From promise. From the simple fact that we have the talent to imagine our future selves from all the possible lives that pass before our eyes. We must imagine our lives well. We must engage our conscience. Conscience is the voice of God, and the nature and heart of man. When I was a little kid, I used to love hanging out in the rain. Drive my mom nuts. I'd watch the flowers. Some would get crushed, but some would burst back up after. So cool. I have to go. Excuse me. Are you one of the survivors? We have your seats right over-- Hello? Is she here? Did she come back? How could you not find her? At lunchtime, we believe your daughter left the school property. How can you let that happen? We try our best, Mrs. McFee. I did try to tell you. Could she have walked home? I don't know. She knows the way. We have men looking for her. She's a little girl. She's a child. How far could she have gone? Hello? Yeah. All right, I'll get right back to you. Ms. McFee... I-- I don't know. I didn't dress her. My husband, Paul, dressed her. The woods near your house. Someone just found a pink jacket there. Emma! Emma! Oh. You've reached Paul McFee at the Department of Philosophy. Emma! Mommy. Mommy. Emma. Emma. Emma. Please. What the hell is that? I saw them putting them up yesterday... for the unborn. Hey. Diana. come on, let's go to school. Hey. Diana, come on, let's go to school. Emma! Emma! Ugh. Ah! Emma! Oh. EMMA Mommy. Emma. Help. Diana! They're all kids. What was that? What? Do you hear that? Hang on. I can't hear anything. What the hell? No, don't go that way. This way! This way! Dee, don't. No. Hey. Michael. Diana. Michael, don't kill us, please. Us? No, I'm only gonna kill one of you. You don't have to kill either of us. Well, I'm going to. The on-- The only question is, which one's it gonna be? Just back it up. Folks, back it up, please. Come on, everybody just back it up. Keep back! Please, please! Ma'am! Back up. Back up. Mom! Are you okay? Oh, my God. All this blood. He missed me. Where's my little girl? Is my little girl in there? It's my daughter. Heaven. It's my daughter. Get off me! You don't have to, Michael, please. Diana! Come on, girls. It's time to choose. If you're gonna kill one of us... kill me. Oh, Maureen. And what do you have to say? Maybe... Maybe I should kill you? No. - No what? No, don't kill me. But if I don't kill you, then who should I kill? Conscience is and the nature and heart of man. This is the life, M. Maureen, what did I do to deserve a friend like you? Um, something in a past life? M, I don't wanna grow up to be one of those hard women that are angry about everything all the time. I know. With a heart like yours, heh... I don't think you're in any danger. But if I don't kill you, then who should I kill? Michael. Shoot me. Shoot me. No. So I was thinking If I just had this normal life, you know? And had kids. And even if I stayed in Briar Hill, that might be enough. Look, M, heh... I know that you and Nate are gonna have, like, eight kids and be one of those perfect families that live happily ever after. McCLEOD: The heart is the body's strongest muscle. Diana! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. Oh, my God. Were you one of the survivors? No. So guess what? What? Nate asked me to go to the movies with him. Oh, my God. A second date, and you didn't tell me? Well, he just asked me in Trig. Well, I'm gonna come as your chaperone and make sure nothing untoward happens. Mm, that's okay. We can double-date, if you want. Bring the professor. Yeah, right. Did I tell you I've been calling him? No. Yeah. I keep getting his stupid machine. He's got, like, a hundred messages of me just calling, and freaking out and hanging up. When is it all gonna start? When is what gonna start? Our lives. Not all of this. You know what you should do? Buy him a frozen yogurt. Mm, that's what I did with Nate, and I got a second date out of it. I have to go to the bathroom. we're gonna be late for class. Sorry.
