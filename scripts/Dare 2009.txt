The girls on the floor... have come here to stare... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... We've come here to stare... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... Yeah... Don't touch the girls... Don't kiss the girls... I have the right to pull the girls... Get in a fight on every night... The scratches, the bruises, and the bites... But I want to touch, and I want to kiss... And if you say no, then I will persist... With you tonight, you'll make it right... You know that you're whetting my appetite... You can call me X, you can call me Y... You can call me Z, you can come and try... Come and try... Na-na, na-na, na-na, na na na... Na-na, na-na, na-na, na na na... Na-na, na-na, na-na, na na na... Na-na, na-na, na-na, na na na... Na-na, na-na, na-na, na na na... Na-na, na-na, na-na, na na na... Almost finished. Okay. You can sit up. Everything is perfectly fine. Are you sure? An irregular cycle is very common with girls your age. There are a lot of contributing factors. Stress is a big one. Your mom tells me you're quite the student. Have you been under more stress than usual? I don't think so. Are you sure there's nothing wrong or abnormal or anything? Well, I would like to start you on a birth control regimen. The hormones in it will help you regulate your period. The pill? Mm-hmm. We'll just see how you do on it. You're not sexually active, are you? I'm sorry, but why did you just assume that I wasn't... sexually active? Well, I did just perform a pelvic examination. So physically, you still have some remainder... of the protective tissue. Oh. Ah, yeah. Yeah, sorry. Hey, hold on. Let me finish this page. Yeah, you do realize that it's not cool... to be excited about reading before school starts. Really? Is that the case? - Yeah. - Such a morale booster. - Little booster. - A booster. When did you become an expert on what's cool? Oh, from the womb. I did try and call Johnny several times over the weekend... to schedule a rehearsal, but he doesn't call me back, so there's no way that I can be ready to present today. Alexa, if you can't organize yourself... I am organized. It's just that he... Excuse me, Miss Davis? I talked to my mom, and she said to tell you... I'm really not comfortable playing Donna's girlfriend... in some lesbian play. Please tell your mother... that The Children's Hour is a famous piece of literature, not some lesbian play. Alexa, you will present today. Sorry, I had detention. Johnny, Grant Matson will be here in two days. Do you understand? You will not embarrass me or this school... in front of my only student that ever made it. Yeah, okay. Okay, good. Now get up there. We're starting with you and Alexa. Oh. Oh, Miss Davis, is it okay if I tape record the rehearsal today... just so I can practice the lines in the right rhythm at home? Absolutely, Alexa. Listen up, people. Grant Matson is doing eight shows a week on this tour... and still made time to come to our class. What the fuck are you looking at? Nothing. Hey, Donna, forgot your script. Nice milk. Moo. Don't worry about it. Thanks, Alexa. Ben. You didn't suck in rehearsal. Thanks. Well, what do you want me to say? I want you to say that I really have it in me... to be so brilliant that people are just gonna be... emotionally devastated by my performance. You really do have it in you to emotionally devastate people. Forget it. I think you should pick me up at 6:30... so I'm not stressed about being late. Okay, Mom. That's a great idea. Ask her something, and she'd answer her in French. It was hi-larious. That bitch is insane. Johnny and I had her sophomore year, and she freaking hated us, didn't she, J? That's 'cause you and Johnny probably acted like badasses. That's me. Johnny, can I talk to you for a second? Is there any way that I can get you to take this seriously? Our scene. Why are you even doing drama? 'Cause he totaled his car... and got kicked off soccer for smoking. Look, I know you don't care about anything but yourself, but this is important to me. Wait, you know I don't care about what? Learn your lines, okay? Listen, I know you lick ass in drama, but don't pull the superiority shit on me anywhere else, okay? Damn. Um, you could leave now. Uh, Courtney. Can you please not be so uptight right now? Okay, I had a really rough day. Mr. Fogel is, like, freaking obsessed with me. He kept me after class... to discuss my problems drawing fruit. I really need to take a mental health day. You mean skip school? Yeah, same difference. Oh, what am I gonna wear on Friday? What's on Friday? Johnny's having this huge party. I'm going with Gabby and Jen. But I want to get something new at Urban maybe. So anyway, Gabby tells me... you get to make out with Johnny Drake. God, she is so obsessed with sex. Yeah, she's a total whore. But whatever, dude. Johnny's really hot. You would totally fuck him. No, I wouldn't, actually. You know, he didn't even call me back about rehearsal. He's the worst possible scene partner. Are you on Prozac and not telling me about it? What? Why? Because your sex drive is, like, shockingly underdeveloped. Same thing happened to my dad. Well, whatever. I'd fuck him. Your dad? Ew. Ooh, you bitch. Wasn't Grant amazing? Yeah, I guess so. Maybe we should just go. After you made me wait 20 minutes? Uh-uh. You're going up to him and introducing yourself... when he comes out. Okay. There he is. Well, I don't want him to think I'm a freak... for coming to his show the night before. Didn't you once tell me that I should support you... in everything it is you want to do? This is what you want to do, so I'm supporting you. - Okay? - Okay. - Go. - Okay, okay, okay. Grant, hey. Hey. - Where are we going? - I so need a drink. Oh, my God. This woman in the first row... What was that? I don't... I... I don't even know. Don't you come toward me another step, Stanley. - Or I'll... - What? Some awful thing will happen. It will! What are you putting on now? I warn you. Don't. I'm in danger. Let's stop there, folks. Grant. Donna and Gabby, you're up next. It's such an honor to meet you. I saw your play last night, and you were brilliant. Thanks. Who are you? Uh, Johnny. Do you want to act? I don't know. Maybe. Well, you're raw, but you've definitely got something. Has Miss Davis forced Stanislavsky on you yet? You should try actually reading it. I think you'd really dig it. Oh, yeah, okay. Thanks. Uh, Mr. Matson? Could I just have a second of your time after class? So you think you want to be an actress. Okay, well, we could do some basic stuff, movement, breath, your accent. Or we can cut the bullshit, and I can tell you how it really is. - Um. - It's your call. Life lessons with Grant or teen acting class. Teen acting class? Great. Life lessons it is. Get up here. What were you doing up here? I was trying to show how Blanche feels about Stanley. Uh-huh. And what does Blanche feel about Stanley? Hm? Well... I think that she's afraid. I think that she feels threatened. At the same time, I think that she's also still drawn to him, you know? It's his brute strength versus her femininity, her power of seduction. Okay, you're smart, so that's not the problem. But tell me something, um... Alexa. Have you ever felt threatened? I feel a little threatened right now. Oh, that's good. But no, I meant, have you ever been afraid of being hurt, destroyed, raped? No. You ever fucked anyone? Sorry, but I don't think that has anything to do... It has everything to do with it. You shouldn't be playing Blanche DuBois, honey. You're a child. Acting is not about making up how you think... someone else feels. It's about having something to drawn on... A feeling of your own. You ever been hungry for anything? - I don't know... I'm not sure I know exactly... Hungry. Like wanting something or needing something so badly... that you will do anything to get it. Look, life's gonna be easy for you. You're pretty. You're smart. You got it real good. So be a doctor or a lawyer. Or better still, marry one. You have no fucking idea who I am! This is what it's about, right now, the feeling you want to slap the shit out of me. I'll learn it. I'll start with the Stanislavsky book. What's the exact title? No book in the whole world can teach you how to feel. You got to figure that shit out for yourself. Well, if you recommended it to Johnny... and some mindless asshole with a God complex can learn it, trust me, I can. Is that really all you can see? Let's forget about the scene and just worry about you. Shake it up a bit. Do something you're afraid of and fail. And after all that... if you still want to be an actress, God bless you. Class dismissed. Alexa? Yeah? Honey, can I come in? Yeah, sure, come on. Come on in. Sweetie, are you sick? You look sick. No, just tired. What's up? Oh, I was just, you know, going through my makeup clearing stuff out, old nail polishes and stuff. I was gonna give it to Marva, but I thought you might like to take a look. Sure, yeah. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. Oh, I thought this was a good color for you. - It's pretty. - Pretty, huh? Delicate, don't you think? Well, I'll let you get back to work. - Okay. - Thanks, Mom. Night. Do you want me to give you something to help you sleep? No, thanks. I have to meet my trainer early in the morning, so I'll see you at dinner. Alexa? Are you sick? It's 11:30. Hey, where the hell were you this morning? I took a mental health day. It's not even lunch. You mean you took a mental health morning? You're hilarious. Sweetie... what is this sweater you're wearing? I mean... get dressed in the dark or something? I don't need this shit from you right now, okay? So please back off. Okay. Clearly, you're on some sort of, like, psychotic trip right now. So I'm just gonna pretend that never happened. I'll call you tomorrow and tell you how the party went. Nice hoodie, Ben. Cute. Hey. Are you hanging out tonight? Yeah. Wow, don't sound so stoked about it, okay? Sorry. I'm just out of it. What was Courtney flapping about? Some party at Johnny's tonight. So freaking status quo. So we going to see a movie later or dinner? I got to go. What? Damn, your ass looks sweet in those jeans. Josh, what are you doing here? Don't get me in trouble. I already have enough shit to deal with. Oh, yeah? I'll give you something to deal with. Come here. Josh! You like that? - Yeah. - You like that? Save it for Johnny's. Oh, what's wrong, baby? I have the lamest scene for drama. There was one cool scene, and Alexa Walker got to do it with Johnny Drake. And I'm sorry that, like, I don't want to play... Donna's lesbian girlfriend in front of the whole school. I know, I mean, if you're gonna do it with someone hot, it'd be different, but... Right? At least Donna knows she's a loser. Alexa hides behind Courtney... and thinks the rest of us don't see that she's a fucking freak. Alexa, where were you during class this morning? I was counting on you making my rehearsal schedule. Alexa? Hello, Alexa, I'm asking where you were. Could you not yell in my fucking face, please? Um, is this detention? You've got to be kidding me. Quiet. Have a seat, Alexa. No talking. Just work quietly. Miss Davis has you here till 5:00. Damn. Decided to be a bad girl, huh? What happened, you forget to kiss her ass before you left? Shh. No talking, Johnny. Nice sweater, by the way. Okay, so I think I have everything. Cool. So what's up with wanting to do this tonight? I just feel like it. The echo chamber enhance the flow at the block party... keeping M.C. heads spinnin' like dark Bacardi This B.A.C. is 2.3... Now his liver's damaged, but his lungs are joint free... So inhale, exhale... Breathe and get well... Johnny! Yo! Stop chirping like Nextel... I'm all in together... A swordsman's forever... I paint the town red with many heads are severed... R.A.W., I still bring trouble to... Throw your raps in the sleephold... Quick to snuggle you... Dart at your breastplate... Meet your death date... Rook down at E4... Look it's checkmate... Jesus, what the hell happened to you? Whoa, girl. Drawing blood and displayed it graphically... Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter... Horrific torture... Mm, nice skirt. And he literally thought that we had had sex. I swear to God. Really? Yeah, I love this song. We have to dance. You're all dressed up. - Hands up. - Okay. Hips, just start gyrating them. Start gyrating my hips? Okay, a little more. Good. You got it. I like it. Are you sure? Okay. Hey. Hey. You wanna rehearse? What? Do you want to rehearse? Are you serious? Well, I mean, I just meant... Why'd you decide to play dress-up tonight? Why are you doing this? It's about time, don't you think? Do you actually like me or... Holy shit. Well, shit. Don't worry about it. I'm on the pill. I warn you, don't. I'm in danger. What did you do that for? To twist the broken end in your face. I bet you would do that, wouldn't you? I would. I will if you... You want to roughhouse? Okay, we'll roughhouse. Ben! Psst! Ben! Jesus. So let's get down about it Hey. Where's Johnny? How should I know? What's up? Nothing. Nice work tonight. Yeah? Thanks. That was kind of good, wasn't it? How'd that happen? It's all about life, chemistry, and not acting, you know? Right on. So you want to come hang at my house? My step mom's gone. Uh, well, what are you up to, Ben? Got to go home. Night-night, light boy. Give me a second. Wait up. Ben. Come on, wait up. Ben, hey. ~What? What? What's wrong with you? Me? Nothing. What's wrong with you? What? What are you doing, Alexa? You ditch me to play with the cool kids. You put this streak in your hair. And then all of a sudden, you're with Johnny? I'm not with Johnny. Yeah, well, you can't be fucking him. God, you don't even use tampons. Why are you being such an asshole? This has nothing to do with you. You can try and play all mature and worldly, but you're not. You're still the same scared, pathetic, perfect little girl. You're still the same bitter, lonely loser... who can't stand to see me have a life... because you never had one. Ben, don't go like that. Ben. Don't rush to judgments. It's a part of development for every teenager. Yes, I do understand. It's not a problem. Okay. Talk to you later. - Morning. - Morning. Want some tea? Sure. Mom, please stop trying to psychoanalyze my adolescence... with your shrink friends. Ben, I was not talking about you. Believe it or not, you are not the only thing... I think and talk about. You could've fooled me. That was Deirdre Walker on the phone. Isn't it a little early? Apparently, Alexa didn't make it home last night. She spent the night at some boy's house... and just walked in this morning... as if nothing was out of the ordinary. - Johnny Drake? - Yeah. Do you know anything about it? No. In a way, it's kind of a relief. Wait, what do you mean? Every parent wants their kid to veer from the rules... once in a while. It's a sign of normalcy. So being a whore is normal? Ben! Why are you being so judgmental? Mom, please. Listen, Deirdre and Doug are going out of town, and they don't feel comfortable leaving Alexa alone. Deirdre's completely freaked out and overreacting, as per usual. So Alexa's staying with us. What? Wait, why didn't you ask me first? Because it's not your decision to make, Ben, and because she's your oldest friend. Why is it an issue? I just don't see why I should have to suffer... because she can't control herself. You're in high school for Christ's sake. It's normal. I'm gonna shower. Do you want me to make you something to eat? No, I'm going out. Morning. Fuck. Fuck? Yes. Okay. Stay here. It's one cookie or one muffin. One thing... You know, I just... I never want that to be my life. Yeah. Edith Wharton? School or pleasure? Oh, school... or pleasure. School, but I also really like it. Yeah, me too, a lot. I'm Nick. Ben. Nice to meet you, Ben. Definitely seen you around. I'm working a lot here, so we should hang out sometime. I could use a study partner. Yeah, yeah. Uh... Yeah, I got to go. But it was nice to meet you. I'll see you. Hey. What are you doing out here? What are you, my social conscience? You know, if you're just gonna be a bitch... Oh, Jesus, don't be so sensitive. Come on. Sit down, Benjamin. Can't believe I don't have anything better to do... than to watch Johnny and Alexa pretend to have sex. It's tragic. Yeah, well... Alexa has nothing better to do than pretend, period. It's not like it means anything. I mean, she's really lost her mind. I guess that's what happens... when you discover the power of a dick. Okay. God, this is what it must feel like... in drama crew Loserville. No offense, Ben. None taken, you chain-smoking slut. Hey. Don't tell Alexa I said any of this shit, okay? All right. Hey, you want to watch from the lighting booth? Might as well be queen of the losers. I kind of just want to sleep tonight. We can do that. I got in trouble. My parents are freaked. I mean, I've never... They're just mad. So? So I should probably just go to Ben's... and be good tonight. Well, what about me? What do you mean? Forget it. Never mind. Couldn't we just talk tomorrow? Okay? I'm just tired. Mm-hmm. And you might want to go over your script, 'cause you missed a line tonight. You headed home, Ben? Forget it. Courtney, would you please drive me to Ben's house? Night, Ben. I had fun. Yes, good night, Ben. I'll be in the guest room... if you decide you want to be human again. Hey. Oh. You need a ride? This is really expensive. Yeah, there's a whole case of that shit right there. Drop the bottle. Drop it. We've had this date with each other since the beginning. What? It's the line I forgot tonight. If you still need to take a piss, just go ahead. I always wondered what it felt like to do that. I guess we might as well finish the bottle, huh? You're a funny kid. Yeah, I guess you might as well bring it over here. I might jump in anyway. I can't believe that's your first cigarette. I'm totally corrupting you. It's kind of cool. Hey, I wonder if Alexa would come over. You think I should call her? Alexa wants to be alone tonight. How do you know? Well, she's my friend. Yeah, your only one. Why is she friends with you anyway? I've known her since I was little. Have you ever even hooked up with anyone at school... other than her? - What? - Just, I... I don't know. I hear you're all talk. From who? Nobody talks to you. Just 'cause I don't want to date some skanky rich girl. Maybe I'm just sensitive. Fuck you, man. You don't know me. Yeah? You don't know me either. All right, well, you can blow me, light boy. Whip it out. I'm not a fag, man. Whatever. I'm not the sensitive one. When did you turn into evil light boy? When you turned out to be a total poseur. Dude... Who the hell are you? You gonna do it or not? You really want it, don't you? Maybe you want it, and you're scared to admit it. I'm not scared. So? I don't want anything. I've never kissed anybody. I'm about to fucking graduate high school, man, and I've never kissed a single person. Are you serious? Yeah. Come here. How's that? Whoa. Sorry. It's just, you're fucking amazing. Whoa. W... w... w... whoa, whoa, there. What're you doing? I don't know. Dude, wait. Ben? Oh, Jesus. - Hi. - Hey. What're you doing up? Waiting for you. It's pretty late. Right. I'm sorry. I was hanging out at a friend's house. No problem, but just, next time, you might want to call... if you'll be in past 1:00. Okay. Did you have a good time? Yeah. Yeah, actually, I did. Good. That's good. You seem... What? - Uh... - I seem what? No, nothing. Just... happy, I guess. Hey, Mom, what did we say about analysis? I wasn't... Good night, Ben. Night, Mom. Ben? Hey. Where were you? Oh. Are you drunk? If I tell you something, will you promise not to hate me? Yeah, if you promise to stop hating me. Deal. I had my first kiss tonight. What? With who? I also gave my first blow job. Alexa? Do you think I'm disgusting? Yes. I think it's absolutely disgusting to give a blow job, on your first date? You're a total whore, and that's final. So... So you don't think... Come on. Did you really think I didn't know? Hey, will you scratch my back? Then I'll scratch yours. Yeah. Hey, Ben? Mm-hmm? Who was it? Johnny. Yeah Okay Benjamin Grimm... Man of stone... Brand-new Audi, hatch, tan and bone... Chilling with a cold can abode... in the hood, where I hear... "Damn, D, throw your man a bone"... Exsquizzy... Just be LVs and Air Max... Crispy ill beats and bare facts... I thought you were in Palm Beach. I was about four hours ago. Now I'm here. Why aren't you at school? I couldn't sleep, Mel. I needed my medicine. Dr. Mohr tried calling twice. You have panic attacks not cancer. Here. Just take one of mine. I don't need it anymore. Well, it's preventative. I might not be around later. Where's my dad? Belgium. Why did you even marry him? He's never around. What's the point? Why don't you just divorce him? Because, Johnny, not all of us have the luxury... of doing whatever the hell we want... and never suffering the consequences. Oh, hey, see, I thought you and my dad... weren't gonna call me Johnny anymore... 'cause it's a little boy's name. - We're not. - So? So maybe you were acting like a little boy... and I forgot myself. Where do you think you're going? The store. I'm out of cigarettes. - Give me the car keys. - What? You know you're not supposed to be driving on medication. You know you're not my mother. You're right. I'm not. Would you like me to call her? I'm going to my room. Shh. I'm checking voice mail. Hey. You sure there's no way you can pick me up? I just really need to get out of here. Hey. What took you so long? Uh, I had to get gas. Have you been waiting out there the whole time? - Yeah. - Oh. Thanks. Yeah. Are we gonna go? Oh, yeah, sure. Ben? No, Mom, it's PBS. You won some hemp tote bags. - Please... - Oh. Hello. Hey, what's going on? This is Johnny. Johnny Drake? Yes. Oh, well, very nice to meet you. I'm Ruth Berger. It's nice to meet you too, Mrs. Berger. No, Ruth. We're casual around here. So... what are you guys up to? Uh, just hanging out. Uh, right. Help yourself to snacks. I have some really, really good hot chocolate... with homemade marshmallows. Okay, thanks. Thanks, Mom. We're gonna go upstairs now. Come on. It was really nice to meet you... Ruth. Yes, you too. Dad and I are gonna watch... the new Ken Burns documentary together... on the downstairs TV if you want to join. Okay. Sorry about that. No, she seems pretty cool. Okay, you can stop looking at my baby pictures now. Sorry. All baby pictures look the same. Yeah. This is my room. Hi. Hi. Mm. Thanks for picking him up, Ben. So you want to see my room? I'm staying down the hall. Well, do you want to watch TV? With my parents? Yeah. Anyone else want some popcorn? It's organic. Oh, yeah. Awesome. Please do not take someone's eye out in my living room. Ben? Uh, no. Good morning. Morning. - Did you sleep well? - Sorry I stayed. It's not a problem. Would you like something to eat? I actually... I kind of have a doctor's appointment this morning. Well, at least have a bagel. I'll make it really quick, and you can take it with you. Okay. Um, is Ben coming down soon? It's still a little early. Oh. Is the train station near here? Oh, you don't have a car. Well, I'll drive you then. Oh, no, you don't have to do that. Oh, Johnny, it's not a problem. I'm a mother. We're prepared for these things. I'll finish up your bagel, and I'll swing you over. Where's the office? Haverford, off of Montgomery. Not a problem. We'll leave in one minute. Ready? So, Johnny, where do you live? Gladwyne. Has your family lived there long? It's just my dad and my step mom. I see. And your mom? What about her? Did she... Did she pass? No, she's alive. I just don't see her anymore. I'm sorry. It's right up there on the left. When did they divorce? When I was two. That's very difficult. I got to go. Who's your doctor? Dr. Mohr. You're a therapist, aren't you? Yeah. Serena Mohr is very good. Yeah, my dad said she's the best. Hey, thanks for the ride. Oh, of course. Please. Um, okay, bye. I think I made a new friend. Well, tell me about him. Her? Him. His name's Ben. He's kind of a loser at school, but he gave me a ride home, and we made out in my pool. I'm not gay or anything. It's just, he was looking at me in this way. So I let him kiss me. What do you mean, looking at you in this way? I don't know. It was like... It was like he wasn't just looking at me, but he was... seeing something in me. Does that sound weird? No. How'd that make you feel? It felt good. And... Like, I could just feel- I just knew that he needed me to hug him. So I did. Mm-hmm. And that... like, felt cool, I don't know. It's like... It was like calm or something. And then what happened? He said I was amazing. Whatever. Why "whatever"? It's funny, 'cause... it never would've happened if Alexa hadn't been such a bitch and blown me off. She said that she couldn't deal with me... and she needed to be alone. That doesn't sound like she's totally blown you off. I mean... everybody feels like they need to be alone sometimes, right? I feel like I'm alone all fucking day, at school, at home, in here. It just felt nice... to not feel alone, you know? I do. Anyway, they're best friends, Alexa and Ben. It's just cool the way they are together. It just felt good to be looked at that way. What do you think he meant... when he said he thought you were amazing? Probably all bullshit, right? They're both just using me, blah, blah, blah. Is that what you're saying? Not at all, Johnny. I'm asking you what you think. I slept really well last night for the first time... in a while, at Ben's house. The three of us just hung out, me, Ben, Alexa. We watched TV with his parents. And you've been sexual with both of them? Yeah, so? Well, you refer to them as your friends. Is that how they see you, as a friend? Or do you think they want something more from you? Listen, nothing happened, okay? I just... We watched TV. I fell asleep. They left me alone. And now I actually feel kind of good, and you're trying to make it all fucked up. I'm not trying to make it all fucked up. I'm just saying, things can get confusing... when you're trying to get on the same page... as the people you care about. So I'm not worth just being someone's friend... because I'm a piece of shit, and they're both just using me? No, I just think, you know, it would be helpful... to look at the whole picture. This is bullshit. You're always telling me that I don't let anyone in. So you should be cheering because your mind fuck... is finally paying off. Yo, J. Get in. - Why were you walking? - No car. You walk all the way from your house? Nah, dude, I had a doctor's appointment. Cool. You sick or something? Kind of, yeah. Dude, that sucks. Where's your bag? I didn't stay at home last night. So what's it like fucking Alexa Walker, huh? I mean, you're the first to hit that, right? Don't be such an asshole, man. What's the big deal? We talk about this shit all the time. Yeah, when we were freshmen. So did you stay at Alexa's last night or what? No, I stayed at Ben's. - Ben Berger? - Yeah. You're kidding me, right? - No. - Dude, come on. He's a total faggot. Don't use that word. It's offensive. Okay, sorry. Whatever. Ben Berger is a complete loser. You ever think that maybe you're the loser? What? Seriously, man. I mean, who the fuck are you? It's senior year. You're still on JV soccer. You're an average student at best. And you lost your virginity to the class slut. No, man, Gabby's cool now. You're nothing. You're nobody. You're just gonna end up at some huge school, join a frat, and blend in with the rest of the useless motherfuckers. You're a fag too, aren't you? If you ever fucking use that word to me again, I'm gonna tell Gabby about the time you dared me... to rub my hard-on against yours in eighth grade. Thanks for the ride. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Fuck you too, man! - Fuck you! - What was that? Josh! Josh! What the hell happened? Are you okay? I'm fine. Whatever. You need to watch where you're going. You hear me? Hey. Entre. Where are your parents? Like they'd really stay in on a Friday night. They're at the beach house, partying. - Hey, Lex. - Yeah? You got company. We're still working on Ben. Go that way. Good evening. What is all this? What's the matter? Don't you like it? Yeah, it's nice. Hey. Nice look. Yeah, well, if Courtney can make you look sexy, I figure she can make anyone look sexy. You have to excuse us. We started without you. It's okay. It's so cute when you're all shy. Welcome to my soiree. Alexa. Benjamin. And last, our celebrated guest, monsieur Jonathan. Thanks. Cheers. To good friends.

I am so sorry, dear, but I completely forgot. How are you? I'm okay, I guess. You? I'm all right. I... I got this internship at the PBS station downtown, help with tech stuff.
