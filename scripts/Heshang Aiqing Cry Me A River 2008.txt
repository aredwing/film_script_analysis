" - "It's all right, only 5.0." - Really? Ma Qiang. Come on. What is it? Check your eyesight. You really think I'm losing my sight? What's that one? "Up. " - Bloody hell! - What about this one? "Right. " "Right. " And this one? "Down. " You should wear glasses! I said you were losing your sight! I'm fine! It's your talk that's the problem! - Help yourselves to drinks. - Why don't you fix this shabby floor? I would if I had the money! Lend me some! Sure, I will. I'll give you my card number. Help yourselves to drinks. How's Shenzhen these days? House prices down yet? "Still high, but they can't sell them. " Really? I should be going. How did you come? High-speed train. Your driver didn't bring you? It only takes two hours. Two hours? From Nanjing to here? Yeah. Not four hours? You still remember that! I have a good memory. I've taken some heavy losses. - How about you? - I bought some equity funds. - Slow returns. - Safe, though. Professor Ma. You're going to reimburse their air-tickets? Oh, right. This is our Mr. Wang. Hand in your air-tickets, you'll be reimbursed. You don't have to do that. We're here to celebrate our teacher's birthday. It's all arranged. There are funds to cover it. - Come on, air-tickets. - You're welcome. Well, if it's covered... My bag. Just there. - This is hers. - Thanks a lot! Don't mention it. Hefei? Quite a way! Thank you. From Shenzhen. And you, sir? From Nanjing, not far. He's rich, doesn't need one hundred-odd RMB from you! ProfessorJi. That's your seat. Good, everyone's here. Wang, take a seat. Now that we're together again... I want to introduce you all to my friend Mr. Chen. His company just listed. He's sponsoring me. And he's the one who arranged this gathering. - Thank you! Thank you! - My pleasure, my pleasure. Mr. Chen, they were my students in the 1990s. Back then, they wrote a lot of poetry. But not anymore. This is Tang Xiaonian. This is Bai Yu. This is Zhou Qi. This is Ma Qiang. Their poems were really good. They put out a magazine called This Generation: I know all about it. You are Mr. Tang of This Generation! An honor to meet you! I read your magazine. I know the first issue was also the last. But I still remember clearly... the sentence you printed on the back cover. "The end of This Generation... does not mean the fall of our generation. " I remember it so well. - You really do. - Yes. I was in college in Wuhan back then. A hot-blooded young man! Later I went into business. No more hot blood, but I still have a good heart. Today is ProfessorJi's birthday. We've come together here today to celebrate it. So let's raise our glasses... to wish ProfessorJi a happy birthday. Happy birthday! Happy Birthday, ProfessorJi! - Bottoms up, okay? - Okay! This way. The second floor is for offices. She's the one I mentioned to you. Who? Our campus queen! Unbelievable! Why? What's her name? Liu Jiaqi. - From where? - Guangzhou. You didn't have a crush on her? Come on, are we playing or not? Your girls all look like Zhou Qi. Come on, enough gawping. I don't know, these kids born in the 1980s... It's scary! How can someone that young look so old? Are you talking about yourself? My son came home from school the other day. You know what he said? He said the monitor and the PE leader in his class... are gay! Seven years old. It figures. My daughter was asked out on a date in kindergarten. Funny. So I need a... - You need some of these, right? - Yes! Right! So your husband got angry? What could he do? Your tile. Which one? Zhou Qi, who takes care of your kid when you go to work? Her dad does. - As I said, you'll have to cover my losses. - Nobody's going to take your money. You're so mean! You like my hair short? You look like a boy. It's too hot in Shenzhen. I should buy you some face packs. Do I need them? I look that old? With all those worry-lines what girl would fall for you? You really like that Liu Jiaqi? What? The age-gap's too big! So you really are losing your sight! Can't make eye-contact with her! You should take care of your health. I sometimes wonder how you spend your evenings. You don't even have an Internet link. And you? Do you miss me when you lie beside Lao Meng? Yes. There are times when I'm with him... that I suddenly feel he's a stranger. I wonder how I can sleep with him. You know... I'm with you every day. In the ten years since we graduated... you're the only one I dream of. The only woman. Leaving me behind? Come on. You should take more exercise. Age catches up with us. Rule of nature! - How are you doing? - Fine. Why don't you ask me? How are you doing? Not fine. Why not? We sleep in separate beds now. What happened? He might be ill. Is he? We last had sex a year ago. I really don't know. He doesn't want to, or he can't? Well, which is it? I checked his cell phone. I think he may have someone else. You think? Does he or doesn't he? I don't want to know. So that's it. How's Nana? Fine, she's Chief Editor now. Out entertaining clients every day. Things okay between you? Just so-so.
