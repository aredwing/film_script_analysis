Steven. | Steven, wake up. What? | - Justin's looking at porn. Oh, okay. | Good night, hon. Steven, he's looking | at naked girls on his computer. And you think that's normal? Well pretty much. That's what teenage boys do. | They look at pictures of girls with big boobs. Should we talk to him? About what, naked women? I don't want him | seeing girls like that. Okay, I'll talk to him. | Good night. I never said | they had big boobs! They always do. SHALLOW END Yeah, that is a sorry excuse | for a swim, and you know it. Just 'cause you made All State | doesn't mean you stop working hard. Sorry, coach. The rest of you | didn't perform any better. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Seriously, what's wrong? I'm just tired, okay? Did you read the Kafka? Yeah, some guy wakes up as a cockroach. | That would suck. I feel like that sometimes. | - Like a cockroach? Like how he was part of his family but | it was like he was a different species from them. Everyone said it was gonna be really boring, | but, I don't know, I found it kind of interesting. Hello, am I boring you? No, sorry. | - Forget it. I mean, no. | I feel like a cockroach, too. Em, is there a way to check on | which websites somebody's surfing? Sure. | Check their history file. Checking up on your kids? I do not wanna be that kind of mom, but... Di, the thing is any kid with his | mouse knows how to clear their history. What's that mean? | - They just erase their tracks. Okay. | Um, any way around that? Well, it gets complicated. | I mean, they block parental controls | that block certain websites. Man, this Internet is getting scarier. Honey, you have no idea. What you listen to? Oh, Switchfoot again! Come on. | It beats the stuff you listen to. What do you mean? | Green Day rules. Hey, guys, what do you think? | Green Day or Switchfoot? Switchfoot's for altar boys. | Got to go with Green. Maybe you'd rather have | lunch with her? Hey, I'm just saying. | - I know what you're saying. Wait here!

For the love of your back rubs. Please don't stop. | I'll shut up. I'll shut up. Ohh. Ohh. So, where are the kids? Well, Alex went to bed early. | Probably has homework he didn't want to finish. And Justin's in his room. You know, this would be a great time | to have that little talk with him. What talk? About the stuff | I saw on the computer. Oh, sweetheart, what am I | supposed to say about that? You're the dad. | I'm sure you'll think of something. He's not a pervert just because he wants | to look at pictures of naked women. Multitasking? What? What's up? I've got a lot of | math homework. Yeah. Right. Okay. Your mom was up late | a couple of nights ago, and she saw some | pictures on your computer. I... Im real sorry about that. | It won't ever happen again. I promise. I mean, it's normal. Look, all guys want to | look at pictures. When I was your age, we used to | hide our Playboys under the bed. Yeah? | - Yeah. But... You know, a relationship's | about more than just sex. Your mom was beautiful | when I met her. I mean, she still is! But what we share is, you know, | it's not just physical. You know, what we... We just enjoy each other's company. Does this make sense to you? No. It sounds like | mom sent you in here. No, it's me, too. But she's worried that there might be | a problem if you're... you know? No, no. Dad. Jeez, there's no problem. | I mean, you said yourself... All guys do it. Yeah. | Yeah, that's what I told her. It's nothing to worry about. | - Yeah. So, how's practice, anyway? | - It's great. Well? | - No problem. What does that mean? I told him there was more | to life than big boobs. You're kidding, right? I said relationships are | about more than sex. I brought up how we share the joys and heartaches that... | invariably come your way in life. Should I be writing this down? Di, I know you're concerned, | but he's a regular teenage boy. He's got to look at this stuff, | then he moves on. It's normal. Okay. All right, everybody. | Listen up! Listen up! | The meet is this weekend, so you know the drill, right? | The three R's! Rest, relaxation and restraint. All right, now. | Who is the best? We are! | - That's right. Yes, we are. All right, get out of here. Hey, what are you doing | with my PDA? Um, just sending myself | an e-mail so I don't forget. Forget what? | - How beautiful you are. Oh, that's so sweet. | You can use it for that anytime. Thanks. Even though that's a total lie. Okay, you got me. | I was playing an on-line game. Duh! AWESOME HOT | XXX IMAGES Yeah, tell the girls less is... - Mom! | - ...sophisticated, not slutty. Mom! - I'll bring in | tons of magazines. Exactly. | - Mom.

None of your business. | Get out of here. Let me see! | - No! Get out! Get out of here! Fine. | I'm telling mom. Okay, wait. | No, no, no, no. Can I see? Close the door. | - Let me see. I said, close the door! Look, what I'm gonna show you, you got to | promise me you won't tell mom or dad. I promise. | - Look, I swear I'll smash | all your video games. Got it? | - I promise. Come on, hurry up. | Dinner's in five minutes. So, how's the history | paper coming along? Fine. I mean, struggling a little bit, | but I'll nail it. I'm thinking about going to Amy's later, | do a bit of work on it. Nope? | - Not on a school night, not this late. Mom, it's homework. Call her on the phone. | I'm sure that'll work just as well. Alex, what's going on? Um, he's all pumped up. | He just defeated the drug dealer in GTA. Nice. | - Thank you. It's pretty cool. The founding fathers didn't talk about religion, | but they were men of faith. And Washington, too? | - Yep, he prayed. O most glorious God, make me to know | what is acceptable in Thy holly word. You know, I think it's tight that | you're not afraid to talk about your faith. Yeah. Most kids don't think so. Who cares? | I respect it. So, will I ever get you to | come to church with me? You never know. | What's it do for you? I don't know. | I guess it puts things in perspective. It comforts me. Makes all that stupid stuff | we obsess about... seem stupid. Yeah, that's cool. You know, you're alright | for a scrawny, righteous Sophomore virgin. Dude, I'm not scrawny. Seriously, dude, angel girl's nice and everything, | but dating? Dude, nobody dates. You know what you need? What every other slacker | in his life needs. A little bit of... Monica. Wow. She definitely is hot. Have you and Monica | done anything no. No, it'd be a little | too weird with Dooley, .. but you, you could. | - Serious? Yeah, she's sick of him. I mean, you're smart. | Now get educated. Get Monica. | - Yes, Monica. Hey. I just shot down | three more Nazi planes. It gets boring | making ace every day. Yeah, I'm sick of | that game, too. Want to see something | really gross? What? Thomas, you got to promise | not to tell anyone, 'cause if my brother caught me, | he'd kill me. What I promise | I won't tell anyone. Dude, snipe him. I can't. | The thing's not working. Hey, I found this pretty | extreme website last night. It's pretty extreme, dude. Another multiplayer game? No, man, something a lot hotter. | - Go for it. Latex. Bondage. Oh, man, get that crap off my computer! | I'm gonna get spam forever. But you got to check out this babe | with the huge... - Don't! Come on, dude. | No, I don't care, bro. That stuff's way too twisted. | Dude, you're getting scuzzy. Sorry, man. Justin! This is a nice surprise. You want to join me? No, I just... got to finish homework in study hall, so I just came down to see | if you were still working out. Oh, yeah. Want to hand me my towel? So, what's going on? No, not much. | That was a pretty decent last 50. You should've | seen me in college. Something happened today? No. Why? You seem upset about something. No, I just got a really bad headache, | probably 'cause I didn't eat lunch today. Nice. Okay. I'm gonna go get changed, and let's go | pick up some takeout food for dinner.

What's going on? Your mother found this | in Alex's room. What is it? | - Porn? Did he get it off your computer? Did he say that? - Doesn't matter | what he said. We're asking you. There's a bunch of guys | at school razzing me, 'cause me and Amy are so conservative | about having sex and stuff. Yeah, so? So they sent me these pictures. Which guys? | - I don't know exactly. There were a bunch of them, | they did it as kind of a joke. A joke? You think | sending porn is a joke? It's garbage, Justin, | and I don't want it in my house, ever. You understand? | - Yes. However you got it, either | your brother found it himself or you showed it to him, | which I hope to God you didn't do. I found it. You found it? On accident. I'm sorry, mom. All right. | Go to bed.

Grading freshman book | reports is my lunch. Maybe another time. I just needed | some advice about something,... Oh, I've got a sec. | Um, what's up? I don't really remember the details, and it's none of my business, | okay, but, um, didn't you break up with Tom over | something to do with Internet porn? Oh my God. Is Steven... No, no. It's, um... it's Justin. Justin? Yeah. My marriage was destroyed because | of his addiction to Internet porn. You got to go. I'm sure this is, like, | some silly teenage stuff.

I moved it into | the family room. Oh. Okay. I'll be in the car. I mean, I didn't understand that. | I don't think we ever went over that chapter. Amy! Amy, wait! Amy! I'm sorry for being | so random lately. Yeah. | So, what's up with that? My mom's been on me a lot | about becoming a better swimmer so I'll go get us a scholarship. Look, I know you're | under a lot of pressure, but why don't you | talk to me anymore? I want to. I will. | You're the best. You know that. I don't feel that way. Hey. Hey, come here. You know I need a bit of math | homework help, so can I come over tonight? You... need math homework help? Come on. | I'm the one who needs help. I'm just looking for | an excuse to come over.

Leather boy! | So, what's sick, slick? Timmy says he's | the new king of porn. Kinky the clown. Well, I like to watch a | bit of porn before swim practice. It kind of jacks me up | a bit, you know? I hear you're a real freak. | Into the real twisted stuff. Come on, you guys. | I'm just fooling around. This whole porn thing's a joke. | - You're the joke, leather boy. Yeah. Hey, dude. | - Hey, freak. I'm still getting perverted spam | on account of you. I ought to kick | your warped ass. We stopped having sex. You know, I thought | it was getting routine, so I... tried to spice it up, | and he went into the den. The computer is in the den. Four in the morning, I go in there, | he's... surfing porn, and... What... What did you do? I couldn't say anything. I was | too embarrassed. I was so hurt. I just turned around | and went back to bed. I wanted just to do | some therapy, but... He said there wasn't a problem. He said it was me, | that I was overreacting. He would stay up all night | and watch that stuff, but he couldn't bear to touch me... | the real thing lying in the next room. I do not want to scare you. | I mean this was a big thing for me. I'm sure Justin's just | going through a phase. Don't all teenage boys do this? I don't know. Am I gonna see you this weekend? Yeah, if you still want to. Yeah, I just thought, I don't know, maybe you'd be hanging out | with Timmy and his crew. No, I mean, | Timmy's cool, but a rest of them... I dont really. What about Monica? Monica? You know I saw you | talking to her. Yeah, so she came to say hi, | doesn't mean, I can't diss her. Have you seen her website? No. I've heard rumors | about it, though. Everyone says she | takes off her clothes and... Does things in front of | the i-cam for Dooley. Are you serious? I never heard | anything about that before. I know she's interested in you. I don't care who's interested in me. I'm only interested in you. Okay, I love you. Justin! I've really missed you. Justin! | - What? We can't. What do you mean, we can't? | Why not? You know what, this is so stupid! Why do we have to be | the last people to do everything? I don't care what | other people do. If all you want is a friend with benefits, then | maybe you should find someone else. Maybe I should. Night, Justin. Amy, is everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine. Okay. And what do you think about getting some sage | and basil plants, you know, for cooking? You guys like the way that tastes | in my spaghetti sauce, right? Mom, you're trying too hard. | - What? Whole that family time, we don't need | to bond, mom. We're cool. Hey, you know, | we got to replant the garden, and I can't carry | this stuff all by myself. And, excuse me, | what's wrong with a little family bonding? I'm not complaining. | - Good. Go. | - Hello? Dont bother. Let's just | do this and get out of here, okay? But today I was gonna go play... | - Just chill, all right? Okay. Yeah. | Okay. I'm sorry. That was Thomas' mother. Apparently, one of his teachers caught Thomas | showing off a pornographic photo on his laptop. Well, I didn't send it to him. No, your brother did. | - I did not. Alex, do not lie to me! It was sent from your e-mail. You're lucky | you didn't get suspended. Why are you looking at me? Because you allowed this | pornography into our house. Justin, I need you | to look at me. I mean it. | Look at me. You have a problem | with pornography. No, dr. Phil, I don't. Alex, go get me a | couple of bags of plant grow. Mom, I... | - Now! Beth went through this | with her husband, Tom. She gave me a lot of insight | into this kind of addiction... That's nice, mom. This isn't some sneak-a-peek, | innocent kind of guy stuff. This is different, | and you know it is. I'm not Beth's husband, okay, mom? I know that, | but let me help you. I don't have a problem | with pornography. I swear I'm telling | you the truth. Okay? I don't have a problem. | - Good. 'Cause I'm shutting off | Internet access. No, mom, you can't do that! | I have homework assignments and class notes off the web. And what about e-mails? Use the library computers at school. You and I are gonna | have a talk in the car. Nice going, | you stupid dork. Stephen, did you... ever need to fantasies about... Porn? Other women? Honey, I'm one of | the lucky guys. I married my fantasy. But every year | I get a little older, a little less sexy... This a fantasy to you... | Sure... Listen to me! You fulfill all my fantasies. Not just the sexual ones. My problem is I | don't tell you that enough. No, but I think Tammy Carson has those. | Hold on. It's in here somewhere. Sorry. I'm still new at this thing. Sexy Girls. Hot babes. Um, I can't find it. | I'm gonna have to call you back. Justin! You forgot something on my PDA. I don't know how that got there. | - Don't lie to me, please! What's happend to you? What's going on, man? Hey, get the hell | away from me! Justin, that's no way | to speak to your teammate. Screw all you guys. Petersen! | Petersen, get back here! Monica's Page Diane Petersen's line. Um, yeah. | Hang on a second. Sorry. | Hi. This is Diane. Yes. I... I haven't... Yeah, I'll... | I'll be right there. Is everything okay? Di, what is it? | What's wrong? Justin hacked through | the library firewall. Of course, this means he won't be allowed | to use the school computers until further notice. Are you suspending him? No, but he's put on probation | for the rest of the school year, and he has detention | for the next four saturday mornings. I think that's more than fair. I have a copy of | Justin's progress report. Oh, God. Why didn't the school tell us | his grades were slipping? We sent a copy of the report home, | and we e-mailed it. But Mr. and Mrs. Petersen, have... Have either of you ever caught | Justin visiting porn sites? No. I mean... | he's looked at some pictures. Yes, I've... I've caught him | looking at porn sites at home. Well, Justin was visiting | porn sites on the library's computer. Look, he's not the only student | with this type of problem. Since all this new technology | makes the internet so incredibly accessible, pornography addiction | has become far more common. If you want some help, I have a list of | therapists you might want to contact. Thanks. | I think we can take care of it. Actually, I'd really | appreciate that list. Let's go. Now. | - I can't. I have practice. No, you don't. | You've been suspended from the team. Are you gonna tell us what | you were looking at on-line? Answer your mother. You know, stuff... | Websites, pictures. What? | - Pornography. I can't hear you. | - I said, pornography! Jeez! I said it's pornography! | Is that what you guys want to hear? I can stop. Well, I don't think it's gonna | be that easy, Justin. But I know I can do it. Justin, you're gonna need professional | help dealing with this. - Mom, no! And, there are consequences | for what happened at school. You're grounded for the | rest of the semester. I understand. Hey, baby. | I'm waiting for you. I want you so bad. Credit Card Information.

Oh, no, I'm fine. | Thanks. Wow, this is nice. Don't sound so surprised. | I might get the wrong impression. What do you mean? That you think I'm a cheap slut | from a low-rent family. Oh, no, no. | I don't think that at all. Relax. I'm just teasing you. Let's go upstairs. Would you... | rather be in your room? No. This is exactly | where I want to be.

I know, but I... | I have to see her. Why? I have to talk to her. | I have to apologize. Okay. But I'm driving you. Thanks. Mom! I do have a problem. And you're right. I can't handle it alone. Do you know what upsets me | the most about all this? That I was always | able to trust you. I felt so fortunate as a mom | that I could trust my son. I want to get | that feeling back, Justin. How do I get that back? I don't know. But I'm gonna work towards that. I really am. I love you, okay? I love you so much. | - I love you, too, Mom. So, you know, give me a call when you | want me to pick you up, okay? Okay. Thanks for seeing me. You want to go for a | walk or something? Uh, that's okay. | Thanks anyway. I have a problem. I do, and I am gonna get help. That's a start. Yeah. Well... Is there any way... | Well, I mean... Do you think we can | see each other sometime? I mean, not like a date or anything, | but just to talk? I don't think so. | I'm sorry. Not yet, anyway. I was actually thinking about | going to church with you. Wow. That's pretty radical. Yeah. I need to get radical. You get that help, Justin, and I'll be here for you if you | need to talk. I'll always be there for you. Thanks. Guess who's coming up the street? Baby, don't. Baby! | - Let go. Game time, boys. What's up, Justin? Easy. Let's go. It's not like beating up a girl, | is it, swim queen? I didn't touch her, | I swear. Just like I'm not | touching you. Yo.
