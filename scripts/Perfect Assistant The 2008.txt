I called to confirm that this is not working Friday, because on that day led kerku in Nju York. Yes, I could not go because he had meeting for Immigration its mother. Except that it was not. It turns out that whatever it is called, is presented false. She's gone over there to know that meeting and continue to Thursday. And no one knows who she is called, iznervirana is because it is cost two days of work. Ok. Odd, but what it has a connection with Rachel? I thought about the road to Nju York. Rachel it went, because nurse failed. Perhaps it is called. Think that it is false presented that went into it York? - This is crazy. - I know that seems incredible, but you see it. - Umjeana is with all that David does. - Yes, but still ... It is not odd that you've both need to go, but Rachel did not. - And then somehow, you are not, and it did. - Yes, but could not know that I'm gonna be sick. Yes, it's true. - Nee, this is not possible. - What? - Funny. - What? I wanted to say that I got sick after I gave Rachel kapuino. You mean to get so far? Who knows? Here, a lot There is no sense. Perhaps she had connection with Branson. - Maybe they should popria with David. - Yes, it should. Perhaps he should rest. We have to popriamo about Rachel. I do not want to osuujem, but do not you think that is too sluajnosti. Maybe you were right. Things are not ... It is time to put her in York ... Thank you told me. I'm going to rest Wednesday. - Rachel, can I have that doe zaas? - Of course. David trying to destroy me. No, no thing is not connecting. Whatever it is, you probably have different understanding of our relationship. I think that you have expectations of me you can not upotpunim. This is not true. In the hotel I am wrong, but all the rest can go back to how it was. No, I think that more will not go. I think it is better by all that you do not do more together. Otpusta me?
