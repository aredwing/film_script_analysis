I'm heading north on the shelf to collect more data. Copy. Blue team, reports show... the Hekla volcano is having immense seismic readings. Proceed with caution. Copy that. Base camp, we're seeing intense magna flow... running up and down the range. If it keeps increasing, we may have to evacuate the area now. All the local areas. Base camp, if the whole range starts erupting, We're looking at a whole glacier detaching from the shelf. This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp. Do you read? Do you read? Can I really talk to base on this thing? Oh, absolutely. I talk to them all the time. This is 6SNL7 to summit camp. Do you read? Try a lower band. There you go. This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp. Do you read? This is 6SNL7 calling summit camp. Do you read? Just can't get it. There's too much interference. I'm going to take down a plane with this thing. Better not. Hey, did you pack your gortex? Hello? Julia? Julia? Unbelievable. You heard me a second ago. Mom packed it. Well, good, I'm glad. You know, it gets cold in New York, Julia. This is 6SNL7 to summit camp. Do you read? This is 6SNL7 to summit camp. Do you read? Summit camp, come in. Dad, I think i just got 'em. Oh, great. Dad, I'm gonna miss my flight! Hold on. Dad, this is my terminal. Dad! This is summit camp. Go ahead. Divya? Hey, I wanted to let you know... that I'm bringing some new instruments next week. Bill, have you looked at the data we sent? No, no, no. I'm not in the office. I'm dropping Julia off at the airport. - Why? What's up? - We're evacuating. The rest of the team is gone already. I'm the last man standing. Evacuating? Why? Dad, I should just walk from here. Hekla went berserk. There's a huge pressure buildup. The endurance readings are off the chart. The entire Hekla line is erupting. There is pressure building up everywhere. Bill, I've never seen anything like this. Pressure building up where? At what site? I'm trying. Guys, hold on. We're seeing activity across the entire range. Wait, at all the sites? That doesn't make any sense, Divya. I checked with the other stations. No one's ever seen anything like this. I sent you everything we got Before the centers melted down, Bill. Look at the data! No, I'm not at the office. I'll be there in an hour. Pull up the computer simulation. Divya, can you read me? Divya? Okay, I'm going back to school now. No need to say goodbye or anything. Reykjanes ridge? Yeah. Divya, are you there? Magna flow rate? F7. Divya, can you read me? Right, I'll be back around christmastime Unless I decide to stay in New York forever. Divya, come in. Divya, if you can still hear me, I will look at the data... and I will contact you... as soon as I get to the office. Divya, are you there? Sir, you're going to need to move your car. It's fine. I'm just dropping my daughter off. We'll be two minutes. Sir? Oh, my god. Come in, 6SNL7. Do you read? Sir, you're gonna have to move your car. Sir? Hart, do you read me? Yes, go ahead, Divya. I read you. Go ahead. I can't believe what's happening! The entire range is on fire! Sir, this is a no parking zone. This is loading and unloading only. I need you to move your... This is massive! What's happening? The entire range is on fire! Every single volcano is erupting! Say again. I couldn't understand. The entire ice shelf is fracturing! It's 1,000 miles long! Bill, do you read me? Something about the volcano. Is not moving. Dad, we need to go. Look. Yeah. Where's Julia? She left, like, two minutes ago. What? Ah, crap. You want me to drive, dad? No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. I just can't believe I missed her. I can't believe I didn't say goodbye to your sister. Mom's gonna kill you. It wouldn't be the first time. Dad, what is Dr. Chandra saying about the glacier? Did it calf? Well, it's possible, But it sounded a lot bigger than that. That would be sick. Sick, huh? Why don't you bring up the simulation again... on the parameter screen, okay? Okay, let's see. Okay, using these numbers, See what you can come up with... for the ice flow projection, okay? I'll be right back. Roy? Bill? What're you doing here? I thought you were out in the field. I just spoke with Divya, And he had sent you some data. Did you receive it? Yeah, the Hekla volcano just erupted. No, but it sounded more than the Hekla, like the whole range went up. We know. Hart, go home. We've got this. I could be pulling maps or crunching numbers. Why are you trying to send me home? Bill, we don't need you. Roy, look, we've been friends for 15 years. What the hell's going on here? Bill, I have just put Cynthia and my kids... on a plane to Mexico. You do the same. We have got chunks of ice... falling all over Canada. In 19 hours, the bulk of the glacier... is going to hit North America. Bill, get your family out now. What did you get? It won't let me input this data. Okay. Well, let's open up a terminal window... and we'll enter sandbox mode. What's that? Well, it's a mode that allows you... to enter in variables that are theoretically impossible. What does that mean? It means we gotta get your mom. Why? Right now. I'll tell you on the way. Hold on. Excuse me, senator. I'm sorry to disturb you, But I just got off the phone with Cyrus... over Atmair traffic services, and he said that all the flights are grounded... because of the volcanic ash flow. Get Quincy in DC and ask him... if they're gonna postpone the summit. Yes, senator. Hey. Your daughter's flying out today. Yes. Starting college. NYU. Teri, these volcanoes are in Greenland. Julia's flying into New York. She'll be fine. I hope so. I'm sure you're right, sir. Thank you. Teri? Teri? Teri? Bill, what are you doing here? You have to come with us right now. Did something happen to Julia? You have to come with us right now. Did something happen to Julia? No, no. Julia is fine. Everything's fine. Okay, thank you. Please don't scare me like that. What are you doing here? I was talking to Divya about the Petermann glacier. Divya? Petermann? What is that? Hi, Bill. Hi, senator. Is everything all right with Julia? Everything's fine with Julia, senator. Sorry to disturb you. But you need to leave town right now, sir. Bill! Bill was just leaving, senator. So sorry to disturb you. Look, there is a huge glacier coming our way, And it's coming at us really, really quick. We gotta get outta town! Listen, I have a summit meeting. No, no, no. I understand. Mom, mom! This is true! We have to get out of Maine. Really? You're gonna bring our son into all your weather... It's true! Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Hi, Josh. Hi. Hey, Bill. I can't seem to get anybody... on the phone about the summit. Not even the white house is picking up. You'd better be right about this. Josh, go home. What? No, don't go home. Get out of Maine. Go as far south as you can! What's going on? Don't scare him like that! Eagle Cliff, flight deck. Requesting sat-com coordinates. Over. Hold for GPS. Glacier located. Bearing 210. Over. Copy that. Eagle Cliff flight deck clear. Foxtrot, whiskey, Roger, I'm getting a visual now. This is Foxtrot, Whiskey, It's heading towards Newfoundland. Why is it getting darker? The weather's changing. Dad, are your headlights on? Give me your phone. I need to call Julia. Can we go home first? I need to get my laptop. We have to get out of town. She's not picking up. I don't understand this. Don't they have Wi-Fi on airplanes? Maybe if she was flying first class. She shouldn't have even been flying at all today. Not today. Don't worry. She's gonna be landing soon. We'll get hold of her. It'll be okay. Whoa. Use words, Nelson. I don't think I can. What? Well, we're not going back home. Why not? Don't have enough time. Look at the clouds. What can do that? Glaciers. Really, really fast glaciers. Okay, so where we going? New York. Take us about Hey. Hey! I missed you. I missed you, too. Sorry it took me so long. Traffic was a mess. I know. They grounded all the flights. They did? - Damn. - Mm-Hmm. Guess we're gonna be here a while, huh? Well, that's not such a bad thing. Ooh, I like where this is going. Oh, crap. I'm sorry. Who's that? No one. Let's go back to the dorm and fool around. All right. Sounds good to me. Julia, we're on our way to New York. We're gonna meet you at your dorm, okay, honey? So when you get to the dorm, just stay there, all right? We're gonna meet you there. All right, big hugs, and love you. Love you, love you, love you. Bye. Are you sure that New York is safe? Bill? How stupid. Why don't we just have her fly and meet us down in Florida? Sweetheart, everything is grounded. I say we stay on plan... and we just meet her at the dorm. Fine. Oh, my gosh! It's okay, it's okay. We're okay. Dad, I think it's coming faster than we thought! Have you ever seen this? No. The glaciers are making it snow in Maine? It's summer. Can you just get us out of Maine now? How big do these glaciers have to be to do this? Bill? Crap. Dad, does this snow mean the glacier's getting close? Bill, it has to because the clouds are looking massive. I bet this glacier is enormous, Like the whole shelf. Yeah. Okay, here's what we got to do. I got to find a way around this traffic. Nelson, jump on the GPS and find me an alternate route. On it. Bill, get us out of here now! We don't know if the glacier is close. Those military planes? F-16s. Nelson, focus. GPS. Target is 400 miles off the Northeast coast... and is now in range. Sir, I don't see anything. Delta Bravo One, target is in front of you. Negative, Alpha Foxtrot. I see nothing. Delta Bravo One, target is in front of you. Negative, Alpha Foxtrot. There is nothing. Delta Bravo One, look again. Holy sh... Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Delta Bravo One, do you read me? Delta Bravo One? Alpha Foxtrot, this is control. Fire sequence in 3... 2... Oh, my god! Dad, get us out of here! Is everybody okay? Is it gone? I don't know. I don't see anything. I think we outran it. What do you think, Bill? Do you think it's gone? I just don't know. Maybe we should just pull over. No, not yet, not yet. Everything is gone, isn't it? Just don't even think about it, all right, Nelson? Everything. God, my friends. I need to get online! No, no. You need to focus on what's important, okay? This is important! No, this is not important! Mom, your cell phone. It's Julia. Julia? Julia! Mom! Oh, my god. Is everyone okay? We're fine. We're fine. Dad's here and Nelson's here. What happened? We don't know. The news is saying that Bangor just got destroyed. Tell her we're coming to New York. We're coming to New York. Mom, can I just talk to her? Tell her that we'll be at her dorm... in six hours from now. We're gonna be at your dorm in six hours, okay? Can you hear me? Julia? Julia? Hello? Let me talk to her. Julia, listen. If the weather breaks, head south to Florida... to your aunt Kissy's house. The further south you go, the safer it is. Julia? Hello? Julia? Hello? Sweetheart, if you can... Mom? Lost it. Dad, I wanted to talk to her. Sorry, buddy. Well, what? My parents are coming for me. I think they want us to stay at the dorm. Well, we should get going then. Yeah. It's getting cold fast. Come on! Evacuation is mandatory... in most Northeast coastal towns. We've been informed, following an onsite evaluation, the president will hold a press conference... with the most current update. The military currently has Awac in the air... assessing the threat. Dropping out at 400. Target is breaking up, but it doesn't seem to be making a difference. Say again, Johnny Bravo. Target is separating into multiple sections... and there's still a lot... heading south down the coast. Wow. Cloud cover's just so thick, it looks like night. I'm getting nothing. I'm trying to call her back. Look, she's gonna be okay, okay? We're gonna be okay. We're all gonna be okay. Can't get hold of the senator. Can't get hold of anybody. Dad, you said the Petermann glacier was how big? Let's see, the last calving happened in 2010. That was about Which is roughly four times the size of Manhattan, And that was only 8% of the glacier. This sounds like it's the whole glacier. With enough speed, who knows how much damage it could do? What? Dad! Which way's your room? This way. Come on. Karen! Oh, my god, Julia. I can't get hold of anyone in Maine. Just try again, okay? It took me three tries. Keep trying. Right, right. Keep trying. Is there a basement? No, there'd be no reception in the basement. I'm gonna keep trying. Come on, Julia! No, that's a mistake. No, Julia, we have to go! What was that? I don't know. Hurry! Put your jacket on. We gotta go. But my dad said to stay here. I know. Call him and tell him, But we aren't staying here, Julia! Mom! Dad! We're not staying here. The dorms aren't safe! I'll give you a call when we... I lost the signal. You think the message went through? I hope so. So then what now? How do we get outta the city? Everything's shut down. We get to one of the bridges and get across the river! Wait, wait, wait! Julia, what about the subway? The subways are shut down, too. I'm not talking about the train, Julia. I'm talking about the tunnels. We can make it through one of those. You really think that'll work? Would you rather stay up here? Come on! Oh... oh. You okay? I'm okay, dad. Yeah, yeah. We're okay. We'll work our way out. Come on. Nelson's okay. We're good. The sun is breaking through. Come on. Easy, easy. You okay? You all right? You're bleeding. It's okay. It's okay. It's just a cut. Come on. Get Nelson. Come on, sweetie. Nelson? You okay? Baby, you all right? Okay. Broken bones? No. Anything? Okay. All right, guys, okay. Good job. I love you so much. It's gonna be all right. You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine, dad. - Good job. Okay, let's get moving. Let's go. We got to get away from the car. Keep going. Come on. We need to find another car. See if that van works. Okay, guys, come on. Come on. So cold. There's no one here. Okay, guys, get in. Get in, honey. Look for some keys. I'm gonna check this out. I'll be right back. It's so cold. Where's dad going? I don't know. He'll be back. Give me your hands. Hello? Hello? Where's dad? I don't know. He'll be back, though, honey. Mom, the keys are in the ignition. Oh, good. Let's start it. Come on. Try again. Yes! Okay, good. It's a mess in here. Smells like shit. Oh, good. You got it running. Yeah. Okay, bad news. There's a big pileup. We gotta find a way... What's that smell? I think it's manure or something. It smells awful. Manure? Like fertilizer? Yeah. What kind? I don't know. What're you doing, honey? Just a little science project. Excellent. Okay. I'll be right back. Where'd he go? What was that? I don't know. I hope dad comes back soon. Okay, inside. Go. Okay, heads down. Heads down. Here we go. Heads down. Okay, why? Just a little science experiment. What kinda science experiment, Bill? The kind that goes boom. See, when you take ammonium nitrate... and you had a little bit of diesel fuel, you get... Whoa! Dad, where'd you learn to do that? In science class. Oh, god, Bill. I have phone reception, I think. I do. I have phone reception. Pull over. Pull over right now! Mom got a reception? Yeah. Well? Mom, dad, it's Julia. It's Julia. Where we going to go? Mom, dad, we're not staying here. Nelson, get on the shortwave. The dorms aren't safe. I'll give you a call... Something bad has hit her dorm. What happened? I don't know. I'm playing it again. Mom, dad, it's Julia. We're not safe... Something's hit the dorm really bad and she's trying to get out. We're not staying here. The dorms aren't safe. She's saying she cannot get out of New York city. What the heck was that? It's a sonic boom. They're gonna go bomb the glacier. Can they do that? Can they bomb a glacier, Bill? Yeah, they could do that, but they'd need to hit it with a nuclear bomb... to stop this thing. That's what they're doing. They said Boston's gonna be hit next... If they don't stop it. Boston? We have gotta get to New York City right now. We gotta get out of here. Oscar Charlie and Delta X-Ray approaching target. Roger, Oscar Charlie. Ordering nuclear payload active. Nukes are hot, waiting for countdown. My son was born in Boston, so let's melt this ice. Roger that. Fire one! Oscar Charlie, do you have a visual? Checking now. Command 483. Nukes deployed, but they have no visual effect. Waiting on next command. Everyone looks so scared. Why are we stopping? Look, we got this big empty van, all these people need help. I figure, you know, we'll open up a door... Our daughter's in New York. We need to get her, and she is our priority. She's our top priority, and we're on our way to New York. I figure we can have a couple people... ride with us to New York. It'll take two minutes... No! Two minutes? Yeah, two minutes. Honey, we just can't leave people out there. Honey? Mom, dad... hear that? Everybody okay? I don't hear anything. I think we made it. Let's keep going. What happened? Boston's been hit! The glacier's less than an hour from us! It's headed right for us! It's too late. We have to tell my parents not to come. All the circuits are busy. No surprise there. Keep it on. We'll try again later. We got to keep moving. Come on. Babe, I know where we are. We could take a tunnel. We tried them all. They're closed! Trust me! Go, go. Hurry. Hurry! Be careful. Careful. We used to go this way when we were, like, 12. Just need to find a light. - You okay? - Yeah. We really have to go down there? Yeah. It's safer than up there. Oh, god. What if my parents try to make it to New York? They're going to get your message. Yeah, but what if... They'll get the message. Hey, guys, we're gonna need to find some gas soon. I can log on and find us a gas station. I don't think that's gonna happen, honey. Power grid is down, buddy. That means no Wi-Fi, no gas stations. I'm really hungry. We just need to find him some food... and let's find some gas. All right? Let's just start looking for something. Dad, look! You can siphon gas. Great idea. Okay, guys, let's start looking for cars, Hopefully filled with food. Hang in there, Nelson. We're almost in New York, okay? Slow down, slow down, Bill. I think I see some cars in the distance. It's just so creepy... when it gets dark in the middle of the day. Honey, just get what we need and get back. Be careful. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. We don't know if anyone's in there. Just stay there. Why? Just stay there. All right. What is it? Don't worry about it. Okay. I can do this. I got this. All right. I'm gonna go pee. Okay. I'm glad that was you and not me. Yeah, me, too. It's working. That is some strong stuff. Whew! Hey, we're in Connecticut. Honey? I'm not stopping. It's pitch black. Hey, Nelson, have you been able... to pull up anything on the GPS? Not really. Are you kidding me? What? Hand 'em over. Unbelievable. You got anything else back there, chef Nelson? Oh, man! I was gonna tell you guys. Yeah, sure you were. Dinner? Thanks. Thank you, honey. Nelson, how much longer to New York? About two hours. You think she's still at the dorm? I'm sure your sister's fine. She's a smart girl and she can take care of herself. It's this way. You sure we're going the right way? I mean, you haven't been down here in 10 years. You have to calm down and trust me, okay? It's the only way, Julia. It feels like we're going deeper, though. What was that? Oh, god, I don't know. Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good. Come on. Wow. It sounds like it's getting worse. Come on. Let's keep moving. Dad, I got a frequency. Go Henry. 11-41 and 44th and... intersection. AJ4-LB. Turn to channel 3 for further details. Copy that. Thank you. You okay? Do you want me to drive? You know, i didn't say goodbye. She got out of the car And I didn't even know it. We're almost to New York, And you're gonna get to see her again. We're gonna get to see her again, okay? Oh, crap. Stay here. Are we in New York? Not yet, honey. Not yet. Hey! Hey! Is your car working? No, it's out of gas. Oh, gas, yeah, yeah, yeah. But you're cool with that, right? I mean, you're stuck, but you're okay, right? Yeah, yeah, we'll figure it out. Right. Are you okay? Why do you say that? No reason. Hey, hey! Are you alone? Hey, are you alone? 'Cause I'm alone. I'm here with my family. Oh, that's cool, that's cool. Hey, you know, it's really cold out here, right? I mean, I should probably get someplace warm. Yeah, I'd say find yourself a car and stay inside. Yeah, yeah, no, no. I'll get a car. I'll go to California. You know, hey, I'll go to the beach... and the pretty blonde women. Maybe have tequilas on the beach. That sounds like a good plan. Nice meeting you. No, no, hey, hey, hey! I'm thinking that, you know, You and I could go to California together. No, we're going to New York. Oh, yeah, no, no, no, yeah. But, you know, New York's really cold, and, you know, we need to go someplace that's warm. Look, I'm not gonna go anywhere with you, okay? You got that? Except you're not gonna leave me. Again, you go. We need to go to California. Just calm down. I got my family right there. Just calm down. Look at me! We're going to California. I got some money. That can help. I don't want your money. I got some food if you want some food. I don't want your food. Hey, what kind of food you got? I need to get into the van. Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no, yeah. No, go, go, go. Get in. Nelson, give me a bag of chips. Bill? Bill, hey, hey. Your name is Bill. Bill, hey, I'm Gary. I'm gary Morganson. Hey, Gary. Yeah, hey. You know, I'm thinking maybe... I need to get in the car. No, we're going to New York, remember? Here's your food. No, no, no. I'm thinking that I should get in the car with you guys. No, no, no. Hey! Hey! Hey! Bill, come on. I'm not a bad guy. I hear you. No, no, I'm a good guy. I'm a great guy. I just wanna go someplace warm, you know? I mean... Hey, hey, kid, kid, kid, kid! Lock the doors, Nelson, lock the doors! Dad, do something! Bill, get us out of here now! I can't we're blocked in. My sister's in New York! Open the door! Open the door! Lock the doors, Nelson. Lock the doors! You guys think I'm kidding? Calm down, man. Think I'm joking around? You're dead. You're dead! Your whole frigging family is dead! All of you are frigging dead! You're dead! Open the door, kid. Everybody out. Come on. Come on, Teri, out. Get out, Nelson. Get out. Go with your dad. What're we supposed to do? Follow your dad, Nelson. Nelson, over here. He has the radio gear! Nelson, don't do it! No! No, Nelson! Nelson, come back! Nelson! Nelson! Nelson! Nelson! Nelson, what the hell were you doing? I got it! I got it! Don't ever do that again! Please. Oh, god! No! No! No! No! The ice! Let's run! Watch out! Come on, guys. We're almost there. We did it. It's snowing again. Okay, let's get another vehicle. Let's try this way. Come on. Where are we? It's the Lincoln tunnel. We can take this all the way to New Jersey. And how far is that? It's about a mile. Come on. Come on. Dad, I don't think I can keep going. Got to keep moving. If we stop, we die. Let's just go. Honey, is that a house? Sure looks like it. Come on. Can we go? Yep, let's try it. Come on. It's so cold. All right, I know, guys. It's so cold. Hello! Hello! Come on in, guys. Sit down. Get warm. Hello? I didn't see a car out front. Looks like they left here pretty quickly. Here. Why don't you go see if you find some clothes, See if you can find some food, And be quick about it because we gotta get out of here. Hello? Hello? Don't worry, baby. We haven't forgotten about you. We haven't forgotten you, Julia. Here, honey, I found these upstairs. Oh, great. Here you go. Should we just let him sleep? No, no, no. We gotta get going. It may look like night, but it's only 3:00 pm. Come on, wake up, Nelson. It's time to go. We don't have a car. We don't have a car. We gotta do it on foot. Get going and maybe we can find one on the way. Here, honey. Shh. What was that? Hello? We're just here for some warm clothes. We're leaving now. Thank you! Wait! Wait! My daddy's hurt. Wesley, come here. Oh, thank god. I think he came this way. Oh. I found people. Listen to me. Don't you ever leave me, okay? Hey, are you all right? Can we help? You okay? I was trying to load our truck up And this whole thing fell on me. It's got my leg pinned down here. Okay, on the count of three, guys. You ready? One, two, three... let it go. Let it go. I think if you lift it straight up, I can probably shimmy out. Okay, ready? Got it? Oh, yeah. You got it? You clear? Yeah. Here. Get up. Daddy, you're bleeding. I'll be okay, son. Man, thank god you guys came along. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? We lost our van at the river... and your place was the first place we came upon. I have a vest just like that. Oh, yeah. Actually, this is your vest. We kind of broke into your place. We didn't know anyone was here. Relax. Look, anything you need here, Feel free to help yourself. Besides, this place isn't even gonna be here in a hour. Are we gonna fly now? No, we're gonna take the truck, remember? Look, you guys, we have plenty of room. You're more than welcome to join us. Which way you guys headed? You know, we're gonna head west. Yeah, we're headed to New York. New York? That's the last place you wanna go. This iceberg is chewing up the entire east coast. In a couple of hours, there's not gonna be a New York. Our daughter's in New York. Well, you do what you gotta do. Me and Wesley, we're going west. Hey, is this what I think it is? My daddy can fly. So can mine. Does this still work? Sure does. Me and wesley would probably be in jamaica by now, But only a fool would go up in this weather. Guys, we're all packed up. We're gonna head out. You're still more than welcome to join us. I know we talked about this, but I think I should go And I'll meet you guys in Florida. I am not leaving you, ever. Dad, dad, you need me to navigate. Okay. Good luck. You, too. Nelson. Okay, Nelson, get this out of the tarp. Let's go. Be careful. How long do you think we have until the glacier gets here? You hear that? Yeah. Oh, my god. Not long. Let's go. Come on! Go! There it is! Jersey! Come on, Julia! Come on! We got to go! Are we gonna be able to take off in this kind of weather? Yeah, no problem. Okay, here we go. You ready? All right, dad! We can probably be in New York in 30 minutes. Just sit back and enjoy this bumpy ride. These clouds don't look normal. Nothing looks normal. Is that a twister? Bill, fly us out of here. What's wrong? Can you fly above it? I don't know. Don't we have a weather detection device? I don't see one. Bill, we're flying right into the thick of that. Hold on! Dad, you got to get us out of here! Fly higher! Higher, Bill! Ha ha! Amazing, dad. Dad! Two o'clock! Look! Are they gonna go bomb the glacier? I have no idea. Everything proceeding properly, approaching glacier. Roger that. We're at the observation location. We're at an altitude of 3-500 feet And six miles from location impact. We need the coordinates to plant the explosions. Roger that. Sending them now. Teams five and six have landed, waiting for supplies. Roger that. We are descending now. Lieutenant colonel Sinor, an hour till impact. Affirmative? Roger that. Come on, come on, get it, go, go! Lieutenant colonel Sinor, how long until the payload drop? Arriving now. Roger that. Come on. We have to find shelter. I have to tell my parents I'm in jersey. We will. Come on. Can we just stop? I'm tired. Not yet. We have to keep going. Come on. Hey! Aah! Aah! Give me your coat! Hey, let her go! - What are you doing? - Stop! Let him go! Give me your coat or I'm gonna kill you! Stop! Stop! National Guard! Stop! Are you okay? Stop! What the hell are you two doing out here? This city's been evacuated! - To where? - To shelters. Hell, you guys are lucky I found you. I was on my last sweep. Let's go! But what about the glacier? Isn't it headed right for us? Not for long. There's a combined taskforce on its way to meet it. So you've declared war on a glacier? That's right. It's the last chunk of the glacier, and they're putting everything they have on it. Now get your asses inside before I have you arrested! Go! Go! That's the last of the explosives, major. Good, good! All explosives have been deployed. Roger that. The charges are in place! Take us back home! Copy that. Prepare for extraction. Roger that. Hey, Nelson. Grab the computer. I wanna find out... if we can connect to a satellite at this altitude. Got it. Should take a sec. Reception blows up here. I got a signal. What do you want me to do? Okay, I want you to connect up to the noaa website. I wanna find out where that glacier is right now. Got it. What's the login? Login is username Julia, Password, Nelson. Dad, that's lame. That is sweet. Lame or not, open up the tracking program. Now run the simulation with the same coordinates, But put in our GPS location right now. What are you looking for? Trying to find out how far away we are from that glacier. Okay, it's 50 miles behind us. It's moving at What? How can a glacier move at 200 miles per hour? I have no idea. I don't think anybody else does either. Can we outrun that? Are we gonna make it on time? Let's find out. What's wrong? We're icing up. Doesn't this model have de-icers? No. We're gonna have to fly low if we're gonna make it. We're burning fuel like crazy. I need you guys to look outside... and see if you can find any kind of private airfield, a crop dusting operation, anything. You guys finding anything? How far away are we from New York? Can't be more than 100 miles. You guys seeing anything? I don't see anything. This visibility sucks balls. Nelson! Okay, guys, hold on. We're gonna go lower. Anything? Nope, nothing. We're still collecting a lotta ice. I may have to put her down at any time, guys. How much more ice can this thing take? Not a lot. These headwinds are killing us. We could walk there faster. How much further is it? About another I'm gonna try to land her at Newark or La Quardia. Will they allow us to land without a flight plan? Well, I'll just radio ahead... and tell them we're an emergency. They have to let us land. What if there's no one there to hear us? Oh, crap! What? We just ran out of fuel in the right fuel tank! Okay, guys, strap yourselves in. Get ready. We're gonna have to go for an emergency landing. Really, Bill? Yes! Get ready! God, look at all of these people. Well, at least we get free cookies. You think your parents are still trying to find us? I hope so. What about your family? Dad's in northern Europe near Oslo. It's probably the first hit. It's okay. I'm happy to be with you. Okay, you guys. We gotta get serious about finding another place to land, because we're not gonna make it to Newark. We're entering into the New York air corridor now. I'm gonna get on the radio... and see if anybody's there listening. Give me the radio there, Nelson. Newark tower, this is Cessna... where's the flight number? Give me the flight number. This is cessna number November niner, niner, 7-2-5. Declaring an emergency. Do you copy? Can they even hear us? Oh, I don't know. What are we gonna do now? Well, we're gonna find a hole and slip into it. Buckle up, guys. One way or another, we're gonna be on the ground... in a couple of minutes, so hold on. I need you guys to look around... to see if you can see any other aircraft... That might be landing without tower permission, okay? Brace yourselves! Two o'clock! Look! You okay? You all right? You okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? Okay. We're down. Okay, okay. Let's get out, guys. Come on. Come on out. Come on, guys. Here we go. You okay? Yeah. Well, I guess we got out just in time. Hey, guys, look. It's New York. We did it! Almost there. Yeah. Did you crash that one eighty? Yeah. I'm really sorry. I got all the insurance information if you need it. If a crashed Cessna was all we had to worry about, I'd call it a good day. Come with me. Let's get you into someplace safe. Colonel sinor, this is command. We are less than Roger that. We are all clear and standing by. Give me a long count, captain. Fire! We got to get out of here. Were you guys headed into Manhattan? Yeah, because we're trying to get our daughter. I'm sorry. No one's getting in and out of New York alive. Just stay here. The National Guard's gonna be here to get you. Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. I'll be right... Oh! Oh! Come on, get back! Get back! We just gotta stay away from tall buildings... with lots of glass, got it? Dad, we're going to Manhattan. Point taken. So how we gonna get there? We got to get ourselves another car... and then just drive into the city. - And go where? - To the dorm. The dorm? She's not at the dorm and you know that. We can only hope she got our message. What, to go to Florida? Look, she may not be in New York, But we have start there. From there, maybe we'll be able to find Some sort of clue where she... Are you willing to sacrifice? Hey, guys! Are we going or what? Were the keys in the ignition? I don't wanna know. I don't even want to know. Let's just go. I'm gonna try and get hold of her again. If we're in jersey, how far is New York? Well, it shouldn't be too much longer. We're coming up to the george washington bridge. No signal. It just keeps saying that all circuits are busy now. It's not going through. We just need to get under the gw. I'll try to get the gps running. Is everyone trying to get to New York? Look at that mess. Nelson, see if you can find another way to the bridge. Sir, you're gonna have to turn your car around. You can't get through here. We have to get to Manhattan. That's impossible. No one's going over there. No, our daughter is there, and we need to pick her up. I don't care if the pope's over there. No one's going in New York right now. Look, it's not gonna matter soon anyway. Please just let us go. But you can't go. Washington bridge, it's out. Wow! The Air Force is coming in for their last air strike. Let's hope that does it, Or maybe none of us will get out of here. Come on, let's go! What are you gonna do now, Bill? I don't know. I'm out of ideas. I know that's not true. I know that you're thinking something. What? Oh, it's just that Remember when the kids were really, really young... and we thought that if we could put... some sort of tracking device on them, we'd always know where they are? I knew I should have invented that device. Damn it! Wait, wait, guys! We do have a tracking device! What are you talking about, Nelson? Oh, of course! Of course what? Even if we can't talk to her on her phone, we can track her phone. Really? We can do that? Yes. Isn't that illegal? Don't ask. I got it! She's in New Jersey! New Jersey? She's here! She's in New Jersey! Oh, my god, Bill. Where? Um... four miles that way. Two more miles. Hurry, Bill! Okay, people, this is it! Stay back. Repent now, sinners! Judgment is at hand! Repent now, sinners! Judgment is at hand! Repent now, sinners! Judgment... How far are we? Which way do we go? There's gonna be a dead end on your left, So we have to go right. Okay, guys, here we go. Hold on a second! T minus 2 minutes for launch. Okay, well, we're not getting through this. How far away is she? Dad, she's just two blocks away. Okay, we're going on foot, guys. Come on. Let's go. What's the gps say? She's that way! One more block this way! Just over a block! Oh! Dad, my phone! Got to get my phone to find her! Nelson, listen to me. We'll find her. Forget it, forget it! We don't have time! Let's go. Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia!

Are you driving on the Hudson river? Is it gonna hold? It didn't last time. Last time? What? You see that? Those are F-16s going in! What was that? Sounds like something big just blew up. We're not gonna be able to outrun it! What are we gonna do? We cannot keep going on like this! I know! I'm trying to find a way off the river! Any ideas? How about that? Okay, if we can make it.
