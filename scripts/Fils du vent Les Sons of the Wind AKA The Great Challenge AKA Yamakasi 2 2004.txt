He's the one giving this reception He is a businessman and he's leading a powerful triad Please, sit down How elegant - Mr Wong is very generous and very powerful He is very distinguished. - Totally. I wonder how much he's worth? Quickly. There are 2 intruders in your office. Block all the exits. Who could that have been? The question is not who it was, but who gave the order. Don't do it Do you have him? - We must go. Bring the dragon to safety We let them run for a while. See you at the meeting Our lifes will change, Tsu. Thank you for coming. We know eachother from stories of others. Everybody does his thing. We can make our sport public together. You want to do a game so we can get to know eachother? I am Leo. Hi, I am Logan - Kenjee. We make two teams. Do you see that roof there? The team that puts the ball there, wins. The ball. Yes, I have the ball. Your turn. Come on. Here. Here. The ball. Give me the ball. Give me the ball. I got it. I got it. Yaguy. - No. Stupid. Come on, here. One point. - It's not over yet. He's got the ball He got it. Nice game. New York. A cool city. You are lucky. Where do you live? - Africa. Kinshasa. Bangkok, nothing beats that. - Asia. Why not? What is this about? A gym for young people of the street. come on. Sorry. My little son is waiting for me - I've got nothing against exoticism. I'll help. It's on the way. Instead of spreading out we are going to Thailand together. About these things you should never think so much Come. This is cool, Leo When does the training start? - We should do something like that overhere. This is gonna be great, guys. It's magical You have a paradise here You really feel like home. I became worried Do you have it? Show me - I dont have it. I left it where it belongs We're sorry we wasted your time. You turn to someone else. No wait, she is still young. Don't listen, master. Let us show you our loyalty By crawling for him? We beg you to accept our apologies. This theft should humiliate Mr. Wong for the final strike. Then I would rule the city You owe me one. Watch out. Kitano, you know our rules Our members dont marry outsiders I know. Because I love a chinese. I will be punished and chased away... like an ordinary servant But I swear, Misawa, that I will return as a master. I give my family her lost honour back. If you fail, you will lose a lot more. You will lose your life. And above all, your wife. I can also succeed. I can take over the lion section of Wong's empire. I am his son in law. If he likes it or not. Watch out for Kien and Tsu. They can betray you. They are chinese themselves. It wouldn't take a lot of effort for them. They are hungry. They will go until the end. Yeah, mate. I want chicken I dont want your sausage. No, the entire chicken the chicken that I see there. boc boc boc. It's for the three of us. No, that's meat. I dont want that I want the entire chicken. Rice, chicken. That chicken there. Easy. I said easy. - Be calm. No one is reacting. - Nevermind. If I watch, I'm an accessory - Control yourself. Come with me. Very good. - That was amazing. I know someone that will be happy Come on, guys. Dont be afraid So, that's better eh? I hear you are going to your grandfather - Yeah, I intended to go. Has it been long since you saw him? - I dont know him. Perhaps that's why I'm a bit scared He will be happy to see you. - I hope so. Our mixed blood will always be a problem. Only the yakuza offer us a future. Why you want to destroy everything so close to the target? We've made a mistake, Kien. From the beginning. My little sister that knows and understands everything. Someday the triads will kill us for what we have done. And if they dont do it, Kitano will. You are wrong. He needs us. She didn't make sacrifices to let us become criminals. Because of her blood the triads have banned us. as ordinary strangers Tell me what she has left us... other than sadness and fear to live. She's dead, Kien. She didn't abandon us, she's dead. I will always be there for you. Anyone wants to excersize? I dont trust it. - We try it. OK, lets go Look out! That's to dangerous. I wont let them go now. Hey frenchman Weren't we clear enough? Leo, do you know them? Triangle To understand your violent behaviour... You must always put yourself in the place of the person you are going to hit. Let's get out of here. Hey frenchman, pass on this message: Bangkok is a battlefield. It's not a playground. Come. Thanks for your help. - You are here on his territory. Why? we didn't want to fight. We just wanted to excersize excersize? He's not allowed to see us together. Go away, or he'll kill you all You should have warned us. - I didn't expect this. When I came there they wanted to scare me off. But if you give in, you dont have a life. I thought I was done with it. - Which is not the case. We have played with our lives. - Sorry, but I'm not going to give up my gym. The day when your agression will dominate you... it will be too late. What are you going to do? - Put my thoughts in order. If you want to stay, you are welcome. - thank you. I've to go too. And you? - I'm going home. I've been gone too long. Let's spend the night here. Tomorrow we take a morningflight. Come, we should find a hotel. Is it far? Are you counting? No. It's the names of those that are not there anymore, to never forget them. What are you talking about? The war in my village. I'd rather not talk about it. It's me. Is he there? - Yes he is. Do you want to speak to him? You want to talk with him. - Put him on the phone take it easy. I'm far away, but I love you and think about you a lot. Really? - You shouldn't doubt that. Do you still have my necklace? - I will never take it off. Daddy, I miss you - I love you and your mother a lot. Mommy, daddy has to tell you something. Hello, yes? Everything ok with you? - Yeah. Tell me... What do you want me to say? Bye. - Bye. Take care of yourself. See you soon. - Right, yeah. See you soon Divorced? - No, just far from eachother. And you? - I didn't find the right one yet. Different than others. Kien? Come on in. Any idea on what we are going to do? I dont travel thousands of kilometers just to fight in Bangkok. That's not for me anymore. I should have asked her. Ik had het haar moeten vragen. - who? the small asian? She's on the wrong side. - I dont want to judge her so soon. Have you already forgotten what happened? - I know She only brings troubles. Forget about her. Kenjee, dont ruin your life. He's not worth it. No. Cut it out, Kenjee. No What are you doing here? I didn't mean it. Leave me alone. - Can't we talk? What are you afraid of? You came looking for me. Go away. Please. Daddy. - My boy. I'm glad to receive you here with me in my house. I'm only here to make my daughter happy. It is good to reconcile our families and cultures with eachother. Our ways are too different. You will never understand that. An old rule of our triad says I will never be able to trust you. Kitano. - I'm sorry. I've to go. Thank you for this second chance. Wong has been waiting long for someone to follow him up. This kidnapping will break his heart. - I will not disappoint you now. I'll be right back. - Are you crazy? Not today, guys. Come back tomorrow. They got away good. - Do you want to trump them? It is tempting. - What? I wont be part of it. Yaguy, Come for a second He is right, he's a father. But I'm in. Otherwise I can forget about my gym We take him to the airport and tackle them. Alright, but quickly. Take me with you... There she is. There. Tsu, Kien wants to talk to you. Tell him he solves it by himself - Do it yourself. That idiot still doesn't understand. Mind your own business. Hurry. This way. Come with me Trust me. Your grandfather knew that you would come He has told me so much about you that I know you better than yourself. You have taken a long way. - Thank you for seeing me. Your grandfather would have been proud if he knew you would be amongst his people. I should have come much sooner. He's still here, you know. His spirit still waits for you. This temple is his residence He has not left it. He's here and there. Everywhere at once He's in the trees. He's in the wind. He's in you They will never find us here. - I want an explanation What do you want with my life story? - Maybe I want to stay then You wont understand anyway - We shall see. He took care for me when I was small. Without him I would be dead. I can't just abandon him. What is he to you? My brother. Let me help you then. Wong has been waiting long for someone to follow him up. This kidnapping will break his heart. Kitano was very serious. We can also do it without her. But what did she do with him? Can't she see that he is dangerous? You always think too much It is time for action. Thinking ahead prevent mistakes. Tell that to your sister. It's her fault that it came this far. After the kidnapping Kitano will take us into his group. It will be a massacre. Kitano will give us the chance to make up for our mistake. This is our last chance. this time we wont let him down. This is not the moment to be weak. Why aren't you there? - We must talk. You want to talk? About what? About Wong's son? - Dont do it. There is another solution. Logan will help us. You do it your way, I do it mine. Everything that will happen will be your fault. Kien. I must stop him. I must warn someone. Think about what I've said. Wait for me. I will come for you. Trust me. This is there hiding place. After the first troubles I followed them. They wont stop until it's settled. Hey you, do you remember us? We'll get them later. We dont have time now. Dammit. You only had to block the road. - Yeah, I went a bit too far. Run! Yaguy, you blew it. We have to go. - Let's go seperate. We'll see eachother upstairs. This way. You wont get me. What are you doing here? You started it We just hit back. It was a big mistake to come here. This will cost you. You talk too much. If you really wanted to kill me, you would have done it some time ago. Let's get out of here. We should never have trusted you. You are no better than your sister. The Yakuza and the triads will take a bet on who is going to kill us first. From now on it's each on his own. We have no alternative. The sister of Kien is here. Kitano had ordered her to steal your family seal... and kidnap your son tonight. With this you will not erase the insult towards me. But perhaps it will save your life and the live of your son. Do you think we are that weak? - In a war no one is safe. Even you. I dont want to see you in this city anymore. But before you disappear you have to do something for me. Mae, I put someone on. She's going to tell you something about your husband. Yes. Still nothing? - Still nothing. Mae just left. I dont know where to. I'm sorry... my friend. You can go. What happens next... only concerns me. Kien and Tsu have betrayed us. With the french they want to prevent the kidnapping. Dammit. I cannot abandon him. Kien? Did you deal with your ghosts? - We have to leave here. You have found her. Where are they coming from? Logan. Our new master wants me to let you live. For now. No. He appreciates your worthy help. But the Yakuza tolerate no traitors. Go and see if everything is ready. I'm sorry. My friends are in danger. I've to go. The road to them brings you closer to your grandfather. You are always welcome here, Son of the Wind. Why did you follow us that evening? What did you do to my friend? Why do you care? - It's your fault. You owe me an explanation. Dont say that. - Are you going to hit me, like your brother? He only wanted to help you and now he's dead. Master, it's him. Your sister and her friend are impatient. And we got one of the french. Where and when? - Twelve o'clock at the industrial grounds. If the door opens I'll kill you. Where are you going? If you leave from the wind, you will leave from the life. Dont be afraid. Let the wind take you to us. Hold on. How are you feeling? What happened? - Logan, where is Kenjee? That's not where he came for It's true. Now we are even. They have my sister and your friend. Who is he talking about? - The Yakuza By attacking us you have messed with their plan. Now they want your life and mine. Do what you want, but I'm going with him Not all of us will not return alive. So dont feel obligated to come. We are in this together. They are in the west wing. And you? - I have a meeting. Where is she? - Safe. For now. What did you expect? Where is the other? You are brave. But your sister will be dead. - No. Friends will take care of her. Kenjee, everything okay? No. What's wrong? He's happy to see you. You've betrayed the love of my daughter... Now you must face the consequences. I'm glad you are here. You have insulted us and you will pay. We have come here to defend our honour. If you kill him, you will become one of us, Kien That's what you wanted, isn't it? Here's the exit. Wait a second. We're not going to leave her brother. Dont do it or you will become like them. Master. - It's over. There are too many of them. My death will do. I hope they will spare you. Tell my wife I love her. In a few minutes the police will come. That's enough time for you to follow your master in shame and blood. Our master showed us the road. If we sacrifice our blood in battle, we wipe his honour clean. Prepare for battle. Do we Fight or run? - Fight. Over the roofs. - No. Armed men are everywhere there. you must conquer the security of your victory without fearing the defeat. As long as you fight with dignity, you win. You dont fight against others, but against yourself unite both our arts and control your violent temper. Then the road will open itself for you. No. Come. No. Do you realize what we just did? Imagine yourself. Yaguy, We were almost dead Let it sink for a bit. Stay. Do it for me. - I can't. Guys, from now on, we stay together We stay together, h? You must live your life and I will live mine. You have always said: We never change. Run, you will never get him. I had a dream. The wind was floating me to you. Do you remember? Hey love birds, What's up with that meeting? Which meeting? - Be patient.
