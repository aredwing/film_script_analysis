There's something caught in the tracks. What's going on? I think the lead vehicle's got a mechanical. See if you can reach it. If it's tomorrow or if it's today I don't say it will be I just say it may When I'm on my knees To the gates I'll stumble And plead my case In a style that's humble It could be tomorrow or it could be today When the sky takes the soul The earth takes the clay It could be tomorrow or it could be today When the sky takes the soul The earth takes the clay It could be tomorrow or it could be today When the sky takes the soul The earth takes the clay It could be tomorrow or it could be today Smell that, Davy? That's the future. That's the brewery. - What's up wi' you? It always feels weird coming back, especially without Ronnie. We'll see Ronnie soon enough. We're home, Davy. We've gotta enjoy it. Have you thought about what you're gonna do now that we're out? Aye, loads. Most of it involves your sister. - Ally, don't go getting carried away. - I'm not getting carried away. You can't just expect her to drop everything. - That's exactly what I expect her to do. - Hey, right? - Something smells good. - Did you get bread? Yeah. I'm on my way from misery to happiness today - Uh-huh - Uh-huh I'm on my way from misery to happiness today - Uh-huh - Uh-huh I'm on my way to what I want from this world And years from now I'll make it to the next world And everything that I receive up yonder Is what she gave to me the day I wandered I took a right I took a right a-turning yesterday - Uh-huh - Uh-huh I took a right I took a right a-turning yesterday Yay, yay, yay, yeah We took the road that brought us to our home town We took the train to streets that we could walk down We walked the streets to find the one we've looked for We climbed the stairs that led us to the front door And now that I don't want for anything I'd have Al Jolson sing... '...I'm sitting on top of the world!' - Mum, have you seen my keys? - No. - There's soup there. You want some? - I haven't got time. You cannae go to work on an empty stomach, Liz. - Mum, I'm late. - Try getting up a bit earlier. - Can you not, Dad? - Here. I'm sitting on top of the world - Oh, my God! - Davy. What were you doing? I can't believe you didn't tell me. Are you good? We weren't expecting you till tomorrow. They let us go early. We thought we'd surprise you. - I was worried you'd be working. - I am.

It's still in the freezer. It's never gonna defrost in time. I was sorry to hear about Ronnie. Could have been me, Dad. Maybe should have been. It was my squad. It was my responsibility. It was a roadside bomb. There was nothing you could do about that. It's good to have you home. Look at you, my wee brother, the war hero. Is this all right? You did say. I'm gonna get back to work. - See you later. - Great. We'll put wee Lewis in with Carol Ann. You can share with Brendan. Don't worry. It won't be for long. - Kids'll love it, won't youse? Yep.

Yeah, he was. He was weird. He was a Scientologist. Well, I thought that meant he worked in a lab. Came from one more like. - Ally, did you ever shoot anybody? - What? Did you ever shoot anybody, Ally? Am I on the top bunk? I'm afraid you're on the bottom bunk. I'm no use for it. OK. - Hiya, Harry. - Oh, Jean. Big day today, what with Davy coming back.

Yeah, and a drink and a laugh is all it is. Now, you can talk or not. He's not gonna be listening. He's just gonna be staring at your tits. I'm not staying long. One drink then I'm off. Well, don't tell me. Tell your sister. She wants you to meet her pal. Another nutcase from the nurses' home? - This one's different apparently. - Different? How? Well, she's good-looking. She stays out in Morningside. She's English. English? That's for you. You celebrating something? No, just fancy getting drunk.

That's boggin'. Right, Lizzie, up. Tell us one of your stories. - OK. - Drunken storytelling? - No one's safe. - OK. This is the story of our first teacher You remember? Shetland made her jumpers And the devil made her features Threw up her hands when our mums said our names - I've never seen her do this ever. - You've never seen her do this? Embroidered all her stories with slanderous claims Whoa! It's over and done with It's over and done with Right, I'm getting more drinks.

They didn't leave the impression that some people say - Get over it, Liz. - Yvonne, you get up. It's your turn. - I can't. What am I gonna say? - You'll be fine. Just tell us anything. Come on, everybody gets a turn. This is the story of watching a man dying The subject's unpopular but I don't feel like lying When I think of it now I acted like a sinner I just washed my hands and I went for my dinner Washed my hands and walked away. It's over and done with It's over and done with It's over and done with It's over and done with It's over and done with It's over and done with Come here, you. It's all right.

Well, it's better than the bottom bunk. The tequila helping? No, not really. OK. I used to come up here a lot. It works every time. - How many girls is that, then? - No, I mean it clears your head. All right, so it's not some weird pick-up technique. What, midnight hill climbing? Do you think that would work? - No. - No. Well, you're here. Must be the accent. Sucker for a bit of the brogue. Och aye? What accent's that, then? Yeah, it's how I ended up in Edinburgh. Met a guy who could roll his Rs, followed him north. - What, you came all this way for love? - I'd like to think so. It didn't last, though. Nearly put me off Scottish men for good. How? Well, if you asked him what he felt about us, then he literally couldn't string two words together. But if you drove through somewhere like Glen Coe, then he was singing folk songs and crying like a baby. Aye, that's fair enough. I can understand why that would ruin our reputation for you. Yeah. I used to think it was something in the water up here. - Or the beer. - It's not the beer. No, it starts way before you reach drinking age. Yeah? It's somewhere in between puberty and the pub. When the inspiration is above our station Thoughts are melancholy and we let them pass We tend to view this nation through the condensation On a dirty glass If misty eyes can witness Love and affection Love and affection Why does the heart still resist? What the hell is wrong with you? I've got eyes of misty blue All the things I want to do Are all I've ever wanted to I was going through some of Mum's stuff and I found this. Thought you might like it. I remember when this was taken. She left a few days after. I know. She got on the train. I never saw her again. Never heard from her. She didn't write. Didn't tell me about you. Well, she said it wasn't meant to be between you two. I'm sorry. I promise you, I do not wanna cause you any trouble. It's complicated, you know. - 24 years ago. - Yeah. A long time. Whenever you're ready, madam. Thank you. There's room in the car if you'd like to come to the cemetery. It wouldn't be a good idea. Well, I am around for a while, if you fancy a coffee? Only if you want to. It was good to meet you. I'd just like to ask you a couple of questions about your kitchen. I'm sorry. Apologies, ma'am. My name's Davy Henshaw. I would like to speak to you about kitchen appliances. You all right, mate? - Good you see you, mate. - It's good to see you. - Where's Ally? - He couldn't make it. His sister's got him watching the kids after school or something. It's all right. You don't have to cover for him. You know Ally. He took it hard. No. No. That's all the more reason for him to come and say hello, then. - Aye. - Some people can't handle it. My wee mum's OK, but my dad, he just bangs on about the weather. What about you? What are you doing with yourself? - Are you working? - Aye, in a call centre. Bloody hell, man. And I thought I had it bad. - It's just temporary. - I thought you'd be army for life. It suited you, big guy. So, how's Rona? She's a woman. Who knows? I suppose she's just trying to be brave. I preferred it when she used to just shout at me. - Is there anything I can do? - You came, Davy. That's plenty. What you doing? It's this silver wedding anniversary list. It's a wonder Mum's put up with you that long. I was a catch, I'll let you know. Lucky she didn't throw you back, then. No, it wasn't luck. We just clicked. - We knew. - How? How d'you know there wasn't someone else out there for you? There was nobody else out there for me, just your mum. My dad, all about the dreams and the romance. I had my dreams. I wanted your Mum, I wanted kids, I wanted Hibs to win the league. - Is that all? - Two out of three, not bad. Right, I'm off. See you later. - Have a good night. - See you, love. - Don't forget your keys this time. - Thanks, Dad. I'm not five anymore. Davy's out tonight too. Got the house to ourselves. Come on, give us a cuddle. I'm just thinking about Mum and Dad's anniversary party. You know, 25 years. Makes your head spin a wee bit, doesn't it? Yeah. I've been thinking about that kind of stuff myself. You know, the future, 25 years. You can actually see yourself that far ahead? Aye. - Doing what? - Well, all the usual stuff. Working hard, bringing up a family. Going to see Hibs. Is that not what everybody wants? You sound like my dad. What's wrong with that? We're doing OK, aren't we? What? What you on about? 'Course we are. Daft. I'd better go. Please don't go Rushing by Stay and make my heart y Please don't go Rushing by Stay and make my heart y You never seem to know the time When you're with me You can tell it to the birds I'll tell the bees I can't do any more To get inside your door And I can't do any more Please let me inside your door - You never seem to know the time - I never seem to know the time When you're with me You can tell it to the birds I'll tell the bees - You never seem to know the time - Please don't go When you're with me - You can tell it to the birds - Rushing by I'll tell the bees - You never seem to know the time - Please don't go When you're with me - You can tell it to the birds - Rushing by I'll tell the bees Good night, Ally. Please don't go Rushing by Stay and make my heart y Stay and make my heart y Give me a ring. Stay and make my heart y I should get my bus. - We could get a cab. - I can't afford a cab. - We could split it. - That's noble of you. - I just wanna see you home safe. - I have to get up early. If we leave now, you'll still get five hours. Don't you mean six? Five and a half, final offer. Stay And make my heart y Make my heart y Better get you home safe, then. - Morningside, please, mate. - Morningside it is. - Have you had a nice night, folks? - We've had a lovely night. It's about to get a whole lot better. Now, five and half hours. - Have you ever stayed up all night? - No. No? Why not try it? All right, trouble? Yeah. Are you OK? I'm out with Mum today. - Yeah? - And your lassie. It's your big night. You want to look good. I'm just not sure this place is me. Well, where do you want to go? I don't know. Where do you normally go, Yvonne? - Glasgow. - That's a bit desperate. It's a wonder you ever go anywhere. - I've been to plenty places. - What, like Spain? Have you ever fancied seeing somewhere a bit more exciting? What, like Glasgow? No, like China, or Brazil. I nearly went to India once. - Really? - Yep. Couple of lasses I knew from art school bought themselves a camper van. They were gonna drive there, down through Europe, then Turkey, into Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan. They wanted me to go with them. So why didn't you? It would have been amazing. Yeah, I thought about it. I think I would have gone. But I'd just met your dad. You gave up the world for him. That's so romantic. Bloody tragic if you ask me. Nobody's asking you. Come on, let's get out of here. Let's go to Top Shop. - You all right? - Yeah. Thanks for coming. - All right? - Where have you been? I was in town. There was something I had to pick up. - What's that? - What? Davy. I'm gonna propose to Liz. Bloody hell. I thought I'd do it at your folks' silver wedding do. - Kind of appropriate, is it not? - Yeah. Why not? Just go for it. - Bro. - My man. Congratulations. Are you going down on one knee? What you gonna say? Well, I hadn't thought about it. I mean, something like... - 'You know how I feel about you.' - Aye. 'Do you wanna marry me?' - You cannae say that. - Why no, Bronco. - You gotta keep it simple. - There's simple. - But that's just brutal. - What are you talking about? You gotta dress it up, man. - Aye, you lay the ground a bit. - What? Look, I'm you, right? - Davy's your missus. - What? Aye. We've been going together Too long to be vague - When there's something to say - Whoa, whoa. All right. If it's not now Then it's never No way. I won't. So I'll say it straight out 'Cause I have no doubt - Hey? - No doubt Let's get married I love you And I wanna stay with you Let's get married Have kids, grow old and grey with you - Let's get married - You make each other happy Oh, but you make each other blue - Let's get married - It's just a piece of paper But it says 'I love you' For the good times For the days when we can do no wrong For the bad times For the moments when we think we can't go on For the family For the lives of the children that we've planned - Let's get married - Come on, darling Please take my hand Oh, and I'll be the one Who's by your side Yeah, and I'll be the one Still taking pride When you're old if they ask me How do I define success?

All right, drinks are on the house. When I was a younger man When I was a silly boy I didn't need a thing I was strong as anything I viewed solitude as a joy I wanna spend my life with you Don't wanna live all alone I can't conceive of the years left to me Without you in our home I wanna thank everybody for coming here today. I know some of you have travelled far and we really appreciate the effort you've made to get here. I think we all know who we're here to celebrate. My beautiful wife, Jean. 25 years ago a priest asked her that question, and Jean had her answer ready. After 25 years of marriage, I can assure you she always has an answer ready. He's a bit slow. He'll learn. But I really do wanna thank her for taking a chance on me all those years ago. I've never been lucky with girls, I confess Don't know who to blame for my lack of success 'Cause even the ones at the back of a bus There was always a risk of a slap in the pus But... Jean, Oh, Jean You let me get lucky wi' you Jean, Oh, Jean You let me get lucky with you First time I met her it did cross my mind Next time I saw her I hadnae the time Third time I saw her I thought that I should Fourth time I met her I knew that I would 'Cause, Jean, Oh, Jean You let me get lucky wi' you 'Cause, Jean, Oh, Jean You let me get lucky with you I love her, I love her, I love her Love her, I love her, I love her He loves her, he loves her, he loves her He loves her, he loves her, he loves her He wants you forever He wants you for good So he's gonna treat you the way that he should For your soul and body My heart's gonnae pound Even after the day that I'm laid in the ground 'Cause, Jean, Oh, Jean You let me get lucky wi' you Jean, Oh, Jean You let me get lucky with you He loves her, he loves her, he loves her He loves her, he loves her, he loves her Jean, Oh, Jean You let him get lucky with you - Jean, Oh, Jean - Oh, Jean!

Your dad'll have it. - There you go. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Come on, Ally. Come on. He loves her, he loves her, he loves her He loves her, he loves her, he loves her It was one night. It wasn't meant to happen. She was going away. We were just saying goodbye. You wanted to give her something to remember you by. It wasn't like that. - Did you know? - Know what? - About this girl? - No. No. I knew nothing until that arrived. It's 25 years ago, Jean. We were married, Rab. We'd made our vows. What can I say? What can I do? Tell me. I want you to get out of my sight. I don't wanna look at you. 25 years, Rab. 25 years of what? Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention for a minute, please? - Oh, my God. What's he doing? - Thank you. Now, we all know who we're here to celebrate tonight. Rab and Jean. I don't know where they've gone. But I'd like to do some celebrating of my own. So I need to ask someone a question. Liz, I don't know what the next 25 years is gonna bring us, but I do know I want to spend 'em with you. Liz Henshaw, will you do me the honour of becoming my wife? I can't. I can't. Ally, I can't. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'd better go after her. Wee man, I hope you kept the receipt for that. It's just a joke. It's a joke, man. It was just a joke, man. - What did you say to me? - What? Who are you? - Calm down. Control yourself. - I'm not taking that from anybody. - Just leave it. Back off. - Leave me alone, Davy. Hey, you, think you're a big man, do you? Do you want me to kill you? Do you want me to break you pal? Hit me again and find out what happens. - Yvonne. Yvonne. - Let's go. - Who are you? - You saw what happened. - Liz. Lizzie. - You cannae do that, Ally. You should have warned me. Would that have stopped you walking out on me? - What was I supposed to do? - You were supposed to say yes. Come on. Come on. We're going home. Come on. I'll put the kettle on. You not going to work? You sick or something? I could skip school. We could play the Xbox or go down to the park if you want. See you later, then, Ally. See you. You should have said. I would have done the shopping. It's done now. How was work? You want a cup of tea? Stop acting as if nothing's happened. What do you want me to say? I made a mistake. It was a long time ago. Do you think there's an expiry date on these things, that after a while you can't be held responsible? No, what I'm saying is we've been through a lot in that time and I think that you should remember some of that stuff. That makes it worse, knowing that this thing's been there all that time, like a wee tumour poisoning everything. Why do we stay together? What do you mean? What if it's just habit? What if it's 'cause we're too frightened to do anything else? No, you don't believe that. I don't know anymore. We'll get through this. I promise you, we will get through it. We'll sort it. I don't want you to see her again. - You mean Eilidh. - I don't want to hear her name. I don't want to have to think about her or her mother. Even - She's my daughter. - Don't you dare. This is my family. She's not part of it. - I will not allow it. - You want me just to cut her off? You hardly know her. No. No, I can't do that. It's not her fault. Then she's all you'll be left with. I like the smell of perfume I love the taste of booze But I hate my love for you Yeah, I hate my love for you I like Johnny Cash Singing 'A Boy Named Sue' But I hate my love for you Yeah, I hate my love for you Yeah, I hate my love for you Most of all You should have warned me. You should have said something. I did. All that stuff about the future? We spoke about it. And I told you that it scared me. I thought it was what you wanted. Why would you think that? Because you said it's what everybody wanted. For God's sake, Ally. We have a great time together. I love being with you. You're my best pal. That doesn't mean I'm ready to march down the aisle. You've gotta settle down sometime. I don't want to settle. - You don't wanna settle for me. - That's not what I meant. So what do you want? What is it that you want that's so much better? I want the world. Ally, you know, I want sunshine and skyscrapers. Languages I don't understand. Music I've never heard before. It sounds like a travel brochure. - Don't laugh at me. - It hurts, doesn't it? I'll talk to you later, OK? No. What else have we got to talk about? You don't mean that. I don't want to be your pal, Liz. Yvonne, we need to talk. - I've got nothing to say to you. - Then listen. I know it looked bad and it was bad. - But it's not what you think. - Leave me alone, Davy. You're jumping to conclusions and I understand why. But I promise you, I would never hurt you. Thought that I'd be happy Gonna be so happy Living life alone and never sharing anything Thought that I was finished Thought that I was complete Thought that I was whole instead of being half of something Thought that I was growing Growing older, wiser Understanding why this world held nothing for my spirit Thought that I was destined Destined to be nothing Destined to be nothing in this world and then I met you I met you I met you I met you I met you - Maybe I just expect too much. - Maybe you just expect the worst. - You scared me. - I know. I'm sorry. - Thought the book was written - Thought the game had ended Thought the song was sung and I could never sing another Thought I knew this city Thought I knew all about it And then one night I went to Morningside and you were waiting I met you I met you I met you I met you I met you I met you I met you I met you Have you chucked that job at the call centre, then? Thing is, Ally, you need to have a think about what you're doing, where you're going. - You can't stay here. - I'll sort something out. It's not fair on the wee ones. - They need their space. - Chrissie! I'll sort something out. How are you doing, sweetheart? He doesn't wanna see me any more. He's just hurting, Lizzie. - It's not your fault. - I'm the one who turned him down. You've gotta make your own mind up about what's right for you. Anybody that cares about you will understand. But what if... What if what you want's gonna hurt other people? You cannae go along with something for their sake. It'll only make things worse in the end. I found this website. It's a recruitment agency for health care workers. So I put my details in and they came back with an offer. - Florida? - Yeah. And you never said anything. Well, you said I should make up my own mind. Come here. That's great, your news, darling. Thanks, Mum. Yeah, I'm looking forward to working with you, mate. So long as you're up for a laugh. Thank you. - Hiya. - Your name? - If you make it out to Rab. - Rab. No. Robert. - Robert. - Yeah. - OK. - Can I ask you a personal question? If you were to fall out with your partner and you wanted to cook something really special to win them over, anything in this book you'd recommend? Are we talking simple but sweet or seriously impressive? I was hoping for bloody miraculous. Escallops of veal and Marsala. It's a classic. Veal? Veal. Veal? OK. You forgot your book. Are you kidding me? 17 quid? I could fly to Italy for 17 quid. It's like he's been lying to me all this time. - Have you thrown him out? - He's on the couch. Should be in a kennel if you ask me. And Liz is moving halfway round the world for a new job. - Where's she going? - Florida. Florida? I'd love to go there. My family's falling apart. I feel like it's my fault. Jean, I'm sorry, I couldn't help overhearing. Harry, I'm just being stupid. Aye, you are being stupid if you think any of this is your fault. Come here. Come on. Come on. - It can happen in any family. - Come on. Come on. Mary Queen of Scots, born 1542, died 1587. Her third husband murdered her second husband, her cousin tried her for treason and her son stole her throne. It's true. If she was alive today, she'd be on the Jeremy Kyle Show. So you listen to me, Jean Henshaw. Whatever happened is not your fault. You have done nothing but work yourself into the ground for your family. You've been letdown, messed around Told to get your feet back on the ground When you should have been loved - Should have been loved - Loved, loved - You should have been loved - Should have been loved You've been ripped off, written off Told an act of kindness makes you soft When you should have been loved - Should have been loved - Loved, loved - You should have been loved - Should have been loved But all your detractors underestimated you 'Cause they don't know you like I do Aye, it's been rough You've put up with stuff Times when we thought you'd had enough When you should have been loved - Should have been loved - Loved, loved - You should have been loved - Should have been loved And anything new you tried to do Got you treated like a jumper in a queue When you should have been loved - Should have been loved - Loved, loved - You should have been loved - Should have been loved But when there was pity And when there was wealth You wasted neither on yourself - Should have been loved - Should have been loved Should have been loved Should have been loved - Should have been loved - Should have been loved Ooh, my back!

Are you all right? Yeah. You are gonna have to speak to him, you know. I know. I'm scared, Rab. You're scaring me. At least you're not complaining about me holding your hand. You never liked that, did you? Shoved them in your pockets rather than walk down the street like this. But I rumbled you. Years ago. When my dad died. You held my hand then. You held onto it. Tight. My heart was broken My heart was broken Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow My heart was broken My heart was broken You saw it You claimed it You touched it You saved it While I'm worth My room on this earth I will be with you While the chief Puts sunshine on Leith I thank him for his work And your birth And my birth Yeah, yeah, yeah My heart was broken My heart was broken Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow My heart was broken My heart was broken You saw it You claimed it You touched it You saved it While I'm worth My room on this earth I will be with you While the chief Puts sunshine on Leith I thank him for his work And your birth And my birth The tests suggest the damage isn't as extensive as we feared. He was lucky. I've given him a sedative. He'll be out for some time. You should think about getting some rest yourselves. I'm not leaving him. Mum, he's out of danger. The doctor's right, OK? I'm taking you home to get some rest. I'm not leaving him here on his own. I'll stay. You go home. I'll call you when he wakes up. Are you sure? All right. Hiya, Dad. - Hey, honey. - Hey. How are you feeling today? - Yeah, I'm OK. - Yeah? Good. Except for Miami. Passport, visa, suntan lotion. I'm not going, Dad. What, because of me? No. How do you think I'm gonna feel if I thought you didn't go because of me? Come on. I wanna be lying here thinking of you driving the wrong side of the road, your Cadillac, checking your swimming pool for crocodiles. Alligators, Dad. Whatever. You have to go. I can't, Dad. I remember when you were little and we used to go on those crazy summer holidays. You were the adventurous one. You were all over the place. More than Davy, and that's saying something. But abroad, Dad, it's different. Hey, you're a Scot. We have to travel to get work. - Always have and we always will. - You never moved. Glasgow to Edinburgh, if you don't mind. Had a nosebleed at Waverley Station. I don't want you spending the rest of your life wondering. You have to go out there. You have to grab it. OK, look, I'm gonna go. - Let you get some... - No, no, no. No, no. You have to promise me first. Promise me you'll go. I don't want you just staying for me. Promise me you'll go. OK. OK what? Is that a promise? - OK, I promise. - Yeah? Big promise? Big grown-up, cross your heart, hope to die, spit on your mother's grave kind of promise? Yeah, I promise. Gotta go, OK? Thanks, Dad. So where have you been, man? Been looking for you. I wanted space. Look, Ally, I'm sorry. I wish it could have worked out better. I hear she's going away. Makes sense, I suppose. I know it feels like the end of the world, but it's not. Things move on. You'll get over it. So Davy's got it all sussed, has he? Davy and Yvonne. What happens when you make a mistake? Maybe you say the wrong thing, ask the wrong question. You wait and see how quickly she dumps you then. I'm just trying to help. I don't remember asking for your help. So what are you gonna do? Well, there's nothing for me here now, so... - Where are you gonna go? - Where do you think I'm going? I've joined up again. Ally, you know what it's like out there. You know what can happen. - It's not that bad. - We nearly died, Ally. It's crazy. So it's not what we're supposed to be doing? Looking for some sort of adventure, something new, something else? - Not settling for what we've got? - What about Ronnie? Think he'd settle for what he's got? - Ronnie was unlucky. - You need to think about this. - I have. - Think again. - Stop telling me what to do. - Why would you want to go back? Because they wanted me! - Ally, I'm begging You- - Davy. I get it. You need to let me do this. Keep your head down. Don't do anything stupid. D'you hear? Hey. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Hi, Rab. Jean dropped this off earlier for you when you were asleep. I thought I'd pop it in. Where's that? That's Ullapool, I think. Have you been up there? No, I've been meaning to. It looks so beautiful. Lizzie. - We're all gonna miss her. - Yeah. As if my heart wasn't breaking enough. The joys of parenthood. You'll want to go shopping when you get there. You don't need all this. Tell me about the hospital again. Well, it's a teaching hospital, so I could choose a specialism and do a masters if I want. Well, you'd better. What will you go for? - Nurse practitioner? - That's nearly a doctor, isn't it? Not quite. Well, that's what I'll be telling people when I'm bragging about you. You'll be fine, Lizzie. You'll be fine. Go on, try that now. When you go will you send back A letter from America? Take a look up the rail track From Miami to Canada Broke off from my work the other day I spent the evening thinking about all the blood that owed away Across the ocean to the second chance I wonder how it got on when it reached the promised land When you go will you send back A letter from America? Take a look up the rail track From Miami to Canada I've looked at the ocean Tried hard to imagine The way they felt the day they sailed from Wester Ross to Nova Scotia We should have held you We should have told you But you know our sense of timing We always wait too long When you go will you send back A letter from America? Take a look up the rail track From Miami to Canada Lochaber no more Sutherland no more Lewis no more Skye no more Lochaber no more Sutherland no more Lewis no more Skye no more Lochaber no more Sutherland no more Lewis no more Skye no more I wonder, my blood Will you ever return To help us kick the life back to a dying mutual friend Do we not love her? Do we not say we love her? Do we have to roam the world to prove how much it hurts? When you go will you send back A letter from America? Take a look up the rail track From Miami to Canada Bathgate no more Linwood no more Methil no more Irvine no more Bathgate no more Linwood no more Methil no more Irvine no more Bathgate no more Linwood no more Methil no more Irvine no more Bathgate no more Linwood no more Methil no more Irvine no more Across the ocean To the second chance I wonder how it got on When it reached the promised land Everything with your dad makes you think a bit, doesn't it? If the same thing happened to my mum, I'd wanna be there for her too. Of course. Even if it meant me going home? Nothing has happened to your mum. - Has it? - No, but it could. What if I had to go? Well, then, I'd understand. I thought you might be a little bit more concerned than that. - Well, course I'd be concerned. - Well, good. That's a slight improvement on 'I'd understand'. What's the problem here? - This is all hypothetical. - But this isn't, us. This is real. - I thought this was about your mum. - No, Davy, this is about me and you. If something happens, I wanna know if you'd come with me. - To England? - Does it matter where? Well, aye, if it's England. What? Look, my family's here. I can't just abandon them. You ran off to the army quick enough. - This is ridiculous. - Oh, right, so I'm being ridiculous. - Aren't you? - OK, fine. Tell me, if I went, would you come with me? Or what? That's us finished? - It's not an ultimatum. - Well, it sounds like it. - Well, answer the question, then! - No. - I think you'd better go, then. - Fine, I will. Ally? Hi, Ma. How you doing? Yeah, I'm good, thanks. Yeah, no, I just... I thought I'd ask how you'd feel about me maybe coming home for a bit. Well, I don't really know yet. Maybe quite a while. Or for good. Not sure. So am I back on the couch? You broke your vows, Rab. I cannae pretend it didn't happen. I cannae act like I'm not hurt by it. But I'll live with it. Thank you. I'm not gonna stop seeing Eilidh. With Liz and Davy, you made me promise that I would be as good a father as I could be. And I tried. I'm still trying. But you just can't turn that off like it's a tap. I need to try for her. I need to see her. What are you thinking? I think you're stubborn. Infuriating. And utterly predictable. So are we going home together or what? Why don't you ask the driver? Hi. Hiya. How are you feeling? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Good. Right. Car's just outside. Dad wants a cup of tea. I'll make it. You all right? Aye, fine. Do you wanna make it work? - Eh? - You and Yvonne. Do you really wanna make it work? - Aye, I do, but... - No buts, Davy. If you love her, just go and get her. - Where are you going? - I need to speak to Yvonne. She's gone. You're too late. What do you mean? Where's she gone? - I don't know if I'm allowed to say. - Francine. - Well, I... - Where's she gone? She's gone to get the train home, to England. She was really upset. What? I had to tell him. They're in love. Sorry. Yvonne! Yvonne, wait, please. Yvonne. - What do you want? - I need to ask you a question. - I don't wanna talk to you. - I need to know something. I'm gonna be late for my train, Davy. Do you want to make this work? - What? - You and me, I mean. - Do you want to make this work? - Look, Davy... I don't know how things'll work out, Yvonne, and I can live with that. But if you're not ready to take that chance... Me? What do you mean, if I'm not ready? - So you are ready? - No, not any more. - But you just said... - I was ready. And then you made your position perfectly clear. But, I thought you were looking for an excuse to end it. I was looking for a reason to keep going. - Why didn't you say that? - I did. I asked you and you said no. - That wasn't the question. - Yes, it was. Was it? Look, look, ask me again, but this time please keep it simple. Your family, your home, they're important to you, I get that, but... I don't know where I fit in. You're a part of all of that now. What if I have to leave and you have to choose? I don't wanna be the one who loses out. Well, then, tell me honestly, do you want to make this work? Do you think I'd be standing here if I didn't? Is that a yes? Yes. So? So? Right. If you have to go back to England, I'll come with you. - Really? - Really. I don't mind. Actually, it's not true. I would mind. But I'd still come.
