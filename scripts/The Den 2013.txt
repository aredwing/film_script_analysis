I'll be your friend. Oh, cool. Okay, yeah. Let's be friends. Can I tell you a secret? Yeah. There's a monster in my closet Uh, you know what? It's probably nothing. It's probably just your imagination. No, it's real. I'll show you. See? It's nothing. There's nothing there. Little shit. Hi. Just..just a second. Can everyone see her okay? Mm-hmm. All right, Elizabeth. The floor's yours. Thank you, professor. Good morning, everyone. And, uh, well, thank you for letting me present in this way. With the popularisation of sites like this one, people who would have never interacted before are now able to connect easily and quickly I can chat with a random stranger in Japan and the next second catch up with my cousin in New york. While video-chatting sites put a face to the anonymous nature of the internet, the question still remains. Who's really out there? I want to find out. For the next few months, I will be logged in to this site 24/7, and my computer will record everything I see. My mission is to interact with as many people as possible, from all over the world. With the complete absence of social barriers, this webcam-based community is unlike any population this school has ever researched. Using this site, we have an opportunity to study a unique aspect of human behaviour as it is seen in its most transparent form. I think we're good here. Hi... Uh, no They're calling again in a half-hour. So, what's the verdict? Well....You got it! The grant is yours! Oh, my God! ..are you serious? It took a bit of pushing on my part. As you could see, they're not exactly the hippest group of people, but they see the value, and they think it'll be a good direction for the program. Thank you so much. This.. it.. I can't even tell you It means so much to me. I promise I won't let you down. That's exactly what I want to hear. Good luck, Miss Benton. Hey. I got the grant. Seriously? Yeah... That's great. I'm, uh, I'm so happy for you. Sorry. One sec. This is Damien. Hey. Um, hold on. Let me, uh, take a look at it. All right. Uh, no, it's in San Diego. Yeah, that's fine. Just bcc me. All right. Later. Sorry about that. So, are you coming over tonight? Uh.., probably not. I really got to get into this. Aw, come on. You'd rather spend your evening chatting with a bunch of strangers than hanging out with me? Hey, this is my job. I know. I just... Want to see you. Well, you're seeing me now. Yeah, but I want the real thing Todd! God d.. Hi Bye. Hello! Hi. Uh, you are very beautiful. Thanks. So, what are you guys up to? Uh, my friend wants to know, uh, will you tell us how to satisfy a woman? Uh, excuse me? Uh, excuse me? He's marrying next month, and he'll have to satisfy the bride. Uh, you know, I..I think maybe you guys should just download some porn. Oh, it's..it's not that easy. Please, you must show us. Just, uh, show us where he needs to touch her. Nice try, guys. Oh, my god. You're on your bike. Hey!. I'm on my bike. Yeah. That's awesome. Is that New york? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Check this out. Oh, my God. That is so cool. How are you doing that? That's 4G, baby. Do you.. wow. Do you do that all the time? Are you okay? Hello? Delivery. Uh, one sec. Want to chat for somebody? Hey. Why aren't you answering your phone. Sorry. I've been working. What's up? Am I supposed to get beer? Uh, y..yeah. Whatever you want. I..I think I have some wine. No. It's a beer night. Maybe whiskey. All right. I'll see you later. Okay. Cool. See you soon. That's so funny!

Oh, wow. Thank you so much. Hmm. Crazy. What is happening here? Don't. Don't. I'm just.. give it a minute. Someone might come. It's like totally creeping me out. Hey! She was boring. Where are you going? Bathroom. Find us someone really interesting Who was that? Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. No. I'm done. These people are terrible. Can we just watch the cute cat videos? Uh, that is a negative. Oh, my God. That's weird. Did you leave it on? No. no. I am almost positive that I didn't. Can computers just turn on by themselves? Not likely. Maybe it was a ghost. Okay. Come on. Be honest. Were you hacking me? Was I hacking.. you wish I was hacking you. You wish a guy like this would hack you? By the way, question.. are you ever planning on leaving your apartment again? I mean, it's really nice out. It's called the sun, water. Okay, I get it. I'll, uh, stalk you later. Bye. One medium latte for Liz. Thanks. Hello? Hey, is, uh, is your webcam broken? Hello? Are you there? Uh, no. Um, but who ..who am I talking to? Thank you.

You're such an idiot. You love it So do you, random girl. Sorry about that. That is his way of telling me to get a move on. It was very nice chatting to you, Elizabeth. And good luck with the whole Jane Goodall thing. Oh, thank you. Well, good night, guys. Or good morning. How did I know I'd find you on here? Hey. Hey. I cleaned up the place. Huh? Oh, it looks really good. Yeah, I know. You should come over here and help me finish this bottle of wine. I'm sorry. I'm still working. Do that later. This can't be good for us. Babes. Don't be so needy. Plenty of couples video chat. Yeah. They live, like, 3,000 miles from each other. We're 10 miles apart. Yeah, but, you know, with traffic, it's...Far. Are we okay? Oh, uh, hang on one sec. What was that? Delivery guy. I ordered some takeout. One minute! Sorry. What were you saying? Nothing. I just.. I'm just tired. Tomorrow's gonna be a long one, so.. I forgot. You leave tomorrow. Hey, why don't you come with me? You can work from the hotel room. We'll do something special when you get back. I promise. All right. Enjoy your dinner. Damien, what the hell are you doing?! I didn't mean to scare you that bad. I saw it on. I couldn't help myself. What are you doing here? You wouldn't come over to me. No. I thought I'd come over to you. Come on. Let me turn it off. No. Just leave it on. No. Very funny. Creep. Oh, keep going. Oh, don't stop. Yes Ow. He just kicked. You could feel it if you were here. Oh, are you trying to lure me over with promises of foetal kicking? Oh, that's what it's come to? So, um, how's the prep coming? Oh, I just finished his bedroom. Really? I want to see it. Can you... All right. Give me a sec. Take your time, fatty. I have a bowling ball in my stomach, sis. It takes time to do anything. I'm pretty sure that babies don't grow in the stomach. All right. Check this out. Okay. I'm checking. Wow. You have really outdone yourself, Lyn. Hold up. What is this space crap? I thought we decided dinosaurs. Well, the guy at the store said dinosaurs are way too '90s. Okay, you trust the guy at the store over your own flesh and blood? Flesh and blood who I haven't seen in months. You're seeing me now. Why doesn't anybody get that? Ass. I got to go, anyway. The satellite guy's here. Okay, you're gonna need to embrace the internet at some point. Bye. Yeah, yeah. Hello. I am Isaac Atabayo. Hi, Isaac. I'm Elizabeth Elizabeth, I need to speak to you about a very urgent and confidential matter, one that requires your immediate assistance. Okay. I am a cousin of the late Nigerian head of state who died in 2010. I need to transfer $11 million out of my country as soon as possible or I will lose it. Okay. What I need is a trustworthy partner -- someone to act as a beneficiary to help me move the funds out of Nigeria. Please. I will give you $1 million for your troubles. Has this ever worked? Yes. I just need these few things. Hey, I..I think I know you. I think we met yesterday. Okay. Yeah, I do. Uh, do you? Yeah, I, uh, I think that I just witnessed a murder. Where are you right now? My apartment. But it happened online. Ma'am, are you there? Well, that looked real. So, w..what do we do? I mean, how do we even find out who this person is? Listen, we don't have the resources to chase down every suspicious video that pops up on the internet. But you just said it was real. I said it looked real. So, is there really nothing else that I can do? Well, I can put a call in to the cyber-crimes unit, see if they've had similar reports. But, like I said, 99% of these they turn out to be nothing. Okay. Thanks. I think it's a hoax. Yeah, it could be. You don't sound convinced. How's the research coming? I'm taking a break. You want to come over? Mr. T's dying for a walk. No? How can you turn down Mr. T? I'm sorry. I just.. I'm still out of it. You know, I..I know this could be.. just be some viral prank, but... I can't stop thinking about this girl's face Well, I mean, there's nothing you can do about it now, so just let it go. What if you looked into it? If I gave you her user name, you could find out where's she from. Wait. Are you serious? I need to know. I could get into a lot of trouble. I'll pay you. With what money? I will give you a chunk of my grant. I mean.. I don't want the money. I'll do it, but you owe me. Thank you. Hold on. Um... Here. This is her screen name. I'll see what I can do. Hey, girl! You're fine! Yo, check it out, baby. I can make you cum so.. It's fake, Liz. You got pranked. How do you know that? Because that's what these people do. I'm sure they recorded your reaction, and now you're part of some viral thing. Uh, did you get my zoo video? What zoo video? It must not have come through. Come on. What's that face? You didn't see how awful it was. God. If it was that bad, maybe you should get off the site. Well, n.. I'm not just gonna give up on the study. The school gave me a lot of money to do this. I can't just tell them that I changed my mind. I don't know what you want me to say. It's the internet. You should have expected something like this. Hey. Nice. Yeah. I was just chatting with this young girl. No, I... I don't.. I think.. I'll call you. I will. I promise. I'll call you. Hey. So, I know you're probably chatting with a bunch of creeps online, but, uh, I just wanted to show you what the real world looks like. Uh, a goat. The zebra. The.. what the fuck is that? Flamingos...As far as the eye can see. And finally...What you've been waiting for.. hard-core smut. Wish you were here. Where this.. How did I know I'd find you on here? Hey, I cleaned up the place. Dame... Hey, how did I know I'd find you on here? Hey, I cleaned up the place. Damien... Hey, Damien, are you there? Hey, this is Damien. Just leave me a message after the beep, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Yeah, hi. Can you please connect me to Sergeant Tisbert? The apartment was empty when we got here. That's his computer. Something must have happened to him. Why isn't anybody doing anything? He wouldn't just leave his computer behind. You didn't find anything upstairs? Just calm down for me, please, all right? Let's just go step by step and we'll get this solved. I got a video from his account. What was on the video? Something Damien made me from the zoo. How's your relationship? Problems? No. We're fine. He wouldn't just up and leave without telling me. I think you should go home, call around. Young guys sometimes do stupid... That sucks. What's up? Um, what kind of surprise? Okay. Hold on. I'll be over in a few. All right. I'm coming. Something is clearly wrong here. This is not a crime scene. It's a waste of my time and police resources, as well, so, please. I'm sorry. You're wrong about this. Let's go, guys. Come on. Hey, are you here? I'm outside your door. Okay. Liz? Hello? Are you in here? Ha ha. All right. Where are you? What? Liz? What the hell? You still haven't heard from him? No. The cops won't do anything for another day. But I've been checking his e-mail for the past day and a half, and he hasn't opened or sent anything. Uh, what about the girl? Did you check? I tried to find her account, but there's no way of knowing where she was chatting from? It was bouncing off I don't know how many I.P. addresses, proxy servers. What does that mean? It.. it means that it's really hard to find out where she was chatting from. Isn't this what you do? I..I don't understand. Listen, I'm trying to do you a favour here. Well, thanks for trying. I know. I'm sorry. I haven't responded to your e-mails. What you did was completely inappropriate and unacceptable. I have had angry board members calling me all day. W..what are you talking about? Don't play dumb. You sent it from your e-mail address. N..no, I didn't send you anything. Okay, s..someone hacked my account. I don't know what this is. Oh, keep going. Oh, don't stop. Don't stop. Professor, this is not... You know, I vouched for you. Please listen to me. Someone hacked my account. Look, I've been talking to the police, and there is something really fucked up happening here. You're a mess. I'm gonna have to put a hold on your project until further notice. No. I want you to talk to someone because you're clearly not well. Hi. Um, I'm Damien Clark's girlfriend. I need to ask you just, you know, a weird question, but he was online for the last two hours. What do you want? I just want to know if you've talked to Damien tonight or.. I haven't talked to Damien since we were 12. But you're on his friend list. Yeah? So? It doesn't mean anything. Fuck. I don't know what you want me to say. It's the internet. You should have expected something like this. Hey. Nice. Yeah. I was just... Are you his girlfriend? Yeah. Have you talked to him recently? Like how recently? Like a few years ago recently? No, like yesterday or today. You worried that he's cheating on you? No. I'm sorry. Uh, actually, uh, I talked to him last night. Um, o..okay. What.. what did he say? Nothing. He sent me a link, and then he signed off. Do you still have it? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Hold on. Give me a sec. Let me find... Yeah. Here you go. Thank you so much. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I'm fucking with you! Yeah. When you find him, tell him he's got a tiny dick. Hey! Why the fuck are you on here?! Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, shit. It's Elizabeth. Um, I chatted with Damien two nights ago, and I didn't notice it, but there.. there was someone hiding in the back of his.. I don't know how I missed it. Um, I think that maybe someone might have followed him. Please call me back. I really need to show you this video. It's Elizabeth Benton. Um, but, please, please, uh, I really need to show you this video. I'm not gonna stop calling you until you call me back. Hi. Who are you? I'm actually just trying to meet some new friends. Let's be friends. Why are you doing this? I just...Want to see you. There's nothing you can do about it now. There's nothing you can do about it now. There's nothing you can do about it now. Fuck! Enjoy your dinner. Don't open up attachments from strangers.. ever. This is not good. What is it? I can't find any of your files. But w..what about my video from Damien. Your drive's wiped. Please tell me you backed up your study. I don't care about my study. Can you do anything to fix this? I mean.. no. I think you need to stay away from this site for a while. Don't touch me. Hey. Don't! What? Look, this is the last place I saw him. I need to stay on here. Listen, Liz, maybe Damien is the one screwing with you. No, he wouldn't do that. Liz, I think you're being paranoid here. I mean, it's not like you and Damien are in that good a place. Can you please leave? Are you fucking serious? Get out! Jenni? Jenni! What? Jenni! Look at you. Look at you. Look at you. What is your emergency? I need an ambulance right away. I'm at 1281 Lighthouse. It's.. it's my friend! Her.. her wrists are cut! She's bleeding everywhere! Oh, my God. Jenni! Hello? Oh, my God! She's not breathing! Jenni! Come on, Jenni. Come on. Welcome to the show. In this week's episode, I'm gonna show you how to load a 9mm Glock. First thing we need to do is load the magazine. Take the flat part, put it against your hand. Grab a bullet, push the front in, push it back. Take another. Push it down and then back. It's that simple. I'm just gonna load in two bullets right now. This could hold 17. Take your weapon. Work it in. Slam it in. You're ready to go. Pull the slide back, chamber a round. Now you want to stare down the barrel like so. And remember to squeeze the trigger. Don't pull it or you're probably gonna miss what you're shooting at. And be careful never to point a weapon at anyone. It's safety first always. That's it. You've just loaded a 9mm handgun. Thanks for stopping by. And don't forget to comment and tell us how you like us down below. And, remember, I'm Dale. See ya. What is this? Oh, shit! Holy.. fuck. Oh, come on, come on, come on, Please answer. Fuck! T..there's someone trying to break into my house! Yeah, I..I'm at 400 Agora Way in Valencia. Yes, yes, I'm in danger. The're trying to come in the house! Hurry! Please! This is my third child. Hey, what's up? Get out of your house right... Lyn... What? Why? Lyn, please just get out of your house right now. Either go out the front... What are you talking about? Lyn, listen to me, please! Just get out of the house right.. I'm not... Get out. Liz? Lyn! Shit. Hello? Is somebody there? Well, were you able to get a look at his face? No. He was wearing a mask. Why would anyone do this? Can I, uh, talk to you outside for a minute? Will you excuse us? Where's your husband? I'm not married. What about the father? He's not in the picture. He should be here. What? The father.. he should be here. Don't you think? That's really none of your business. Thank you. See? No one's here. Um, I'll.. I'll see you soon, okay? Everything's good. Okay. Um, I'm.. I'm just gonna take a few minutes and pack some stuff and I'll be out, okay?

There are others out here that are doing this, too. I've seen them on the monitor. What was that? I don't know. They're watching everything. Max. Max! Liz, you got to listen to me. Behind this.. Max, can you hear me? You got to listen to me. This is a recording. I saw it yesterday. Somebody help! In a few seconds, someone's gonna come in, and they're gonna.. Help! No. Somebody! Help! Help! Max! I'm so sorry! No! Damien! Ugh! Where the fuck is he?! Where? He's not here. Oh, God. Come on. Come on. Come on. Wah! Tell her what I saw on there the other night. Oh, shut up.
