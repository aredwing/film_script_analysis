JERRY: No. l was actually calling about the reunion, you know, 'cause it's right around the corner. ...from Barkledge High School. ls this... ...well, I... Herbert Farberjust hung up on me. Jesus, dude, how many times have you been married? Well, bring 'em all. May I speak with Jeff Suttleson, please? Jeff? Dan Landsman. From high school. The D Man. No? Nothin'? Neil Boitress, D Money. (CHUCKLES) Dan Landsman. It was a nickname. Everyone used to call me that. Yes, they did. They definitely did. Class of '94? Yes, there we go. No, I don't think I still suck. Yes, it's that time. (LAUGHS) Twenty years. Can you believe it? Well, we sent out a paper invitation and followed that up with an e-vite, and a link to the Facebook page. 0h, you did'? Great! But you're not... Got it. There seemed to be a little indecision in your voice. I'm gonna see if I could flip you. Flip you to a yes. Okay. That's not very mature. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) -(GATE SLAMS) -DAN: Whoops! Craig? Randy? - DAN: So... -l'm up for beers. What are you guys doing? You guys grabbing beers, or... Yeah, I don't think... I'm gonna head home myself. Yeah. So... -(CAR BEEPS) -Maybe next time. - CRAIG: Yeah, yeah. -RANDY: All right, buddy. - Okay. -Probably next time. OKHY- - RANDY: Yeah, I'll call you. -(DOOR CLOSES) MAN 1: (on RADIO) Well, I'm askin' you what the... What is the future of Pirates' baseball? MAN 2: The problem is here in Pittsburgh we know that we can't spend as much on salary, so they constantly have guys that they develop, that leave Pittsburgh. MAN 1: Well, you know what? You can't bring Dave Parker back. You can? bring back Willie Slargell. You gotta go with what got you there. You gotta go with prospects. Do you think McCulchen is enough to lead this team to a World Series? (SIGHS HEAVILY) (CUTLERY CLINKING) They invite you for drinks? No. Did you tell them that you wanted to go like we talked about? - Yeah. They just weren't goin' tonight. -Oh. I thought they said that last time, but then you drove by and you saw them. Yeah, well, they weren't doing that this time. Zach, wanna tell your dad about your new girlfriend? - Girlfriend? -She's not my girlfriend. Just heard this girl, Heather, likes me. STACEY: She's older. I told him he should ask her out. You think I should? (INHALES DEEPLY) Hmm. I'd do a little more investigating. These girls usually like older guys. I think that's what I'm bumpin' up against. You know, put some feelers out there. I did. And her friend said it's true. Yeah, well, you never know. I mean, the friend could be lying. Why would she lie? Well, what if it's a prank planned by all the girls at school to get you to ask her out and then they all laugh and make fun of you? - Dan! -What? I'm just preparing him for certain realities of high school. (PHONE RINGING) WOMAN: Good morning. Shurmur Consulting. May I help you? - No... -(GROANS) DAN: Come on. -(SCROLL WHEEL WHIRRING) -(RAPID CLICKING) Come on! -(BEEPING) -(KEYS CLACKING) BILL; What the fuck is this? Where are they? I don't get this. Bill, have you got a second? 0h, yeah, Daniel, come on in. (SIGHING) I hate to bring this up again, but the Internet connection is so beyond frustrating. - What do you mean, the cord? -No, not the cord. The speed. We got to get with it, you know. - That's why we lost the Harkin account. -No. I went to high school with Dale Harkin, and he won't work with us? The reason we lost the Harkin account is 'cause Dale's dad is a liar. Dale's dad is a perjurer. And he wants things faster. He emails. I've been doing this job for 40 years without a computer, and I'm doing fine. Okay, but what happened to the Bill Shurmur I always wanted to work for'? The Bill Shurmur who always loved calchin' that big fish. (SIGHS) Daniel, I get it. I hear you. I just don't have the funds for these toys. (SIGHS) I can't. Don't do that. Thafs not fair. Come here. All right, you're my guy. You know that, right? Yeah, but... And you've been telling me to think bigger for years, but I need to have a little more cashola first, and then, I promise you, the Dan Plan is a go. I promise you. (BLOWS RASPBERRY) Get out of here. (SIGHS) MAN: (ON TV) Now on sale at Cabinets To Go. We've got solid wood, high-quality kitchen cabinets with features like self-closing European-style hardware, dovetail joints, and guaranteed moisture... Come on in. You'll find the quality... The ocean and the sun. Both beautiful, both deadly. Now, the ocean, I can keep that safe pretty easily. But the sun... (COMMERCIAL REWINDS) The ocean and the sun. Both beautiful, both deadly. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) DAN: Stacey? Honey? OLIVER: This is my beach. And I need to protect it. Now, the ocean, I can keep that safe pretty easily. But the sun, (CHUCKLES) I leave that to Banana Boat triple defense sunscreen for men. (BABY CRYING) (SIGHS) What? You didn't notice anything there? I don't know what we're looking for. Fucking Lawless! Oliver Lawless. - From high school? -Yes, from high school. On a national commercial. He did it. He made it! Zach, that was one of Daddy's good friends. - ZACH: Really? -STACEY: (SIGHS) No, it was not. - He was a friend. -This is what you woke us up for? God damn it, Dan! It's gonna take me half an hour to put her back to bed. Go to sleep, Zach, please. All right. STACEY: Jesus! Let's watch it one more time. OLIVER: ...sunscreen for men. Hey, Dad, can I ask you about Heather? Not now, Zach, we're watching. We've seen i1 a bunch now. It's crazy, right? - Yeah, I guess. -You guess? What? Right? How many of your close buddies are on a national TV spot, come on. And I'm recording. (CELL PHONE CHIMES) OLIVER: ...the ocean and the sun... Nope. No, no, no, stop. You got to stafl earlier, then hit play, then exit, so the bar goes away before it starts. Okay, let's do it again. Run it back. Back it up, and give me some volume. - Mom said that I... -Don't worry about Mom. I'll handle Mom. Come on, Zach. One more time, we're so close. And play- Banana Boat. The only boat en route to protecting your skin. (WOMAN SCREAMING) - Excuse me. Good? (EXCLAIMS) Zachary! (GRU NTS) Hang up the phones. Hang up the phones. OKHY- - Boop! -Jesus Christ! What are you doing? And...boop. - RANDY: Uh... What the fuck? -l'll tell you what the fuck, Randy. D-Fresh has an idea. - Who's D-Fresh? -lt's me, Jerry. Focus. I have an idea. It's gonna take this thing to the next level. And get every single person from our class to RSVP "yes." How? Taj, bring up the reunion Facebook page for me, please. Everyone gather around. - Gather around? -Come on. Chop chop. MAN: Why? Why would we do that? Press play for me, Taj. - OLIVER: The ocean and the sun. - And full screen it for me' Taj. Both beautiful, both deadly. RANDY; What the fuck is this? - Is that Oliver Lawless? -Yes! DAN: It's Oliver Lawless. He's a big Hollywood actor now. We get Lawless to come, the whole class will follow. It's like one of those bullshit charity events. They bring out the celebrities. If Dave Schwimmer goes, everyone goes. Look, as chairman of the alumni committee... There is no chairman, Dan. Okay, then how come I am the only one with the administrator password to the Facebook page, Lucy? Because you set it up and you won't give it to anyone. Whatever! I'm telling you he's the answer here, guys. Okay. Let's just assume that you're right, and I'm not sayin' that you are, but lefsjust, uh... Let's assume it for a second. - Okay. -Hovvre we supposed to get him? Yeah. He hasn't responded to anything. - RANDY: Nothing. -Mmm-hmm. Maybe I should be the one reaching out. We're old friends. Um... You were not friends with Lawless. 0h, was I not, Randy? Is that why he sent me the video, 'cause we weren't friends? Well, you could've just recorded it off your TV. - CRAIG: Mmm-hmm. -RANDY: That's obviously what he did. Guys, guys, we're getting away from the issue here. Okay, okay, how 'bout we go to the other issue then. The one where you're, like, lying about being friends with Lawless. I don't need this. I'm going to get my friend Oliver Lawless to come to this reunion and then we'll see which issue is which. What? DAN: Oliver! What's up, dude? Haven't seen you in a long time, bm. Since high school? Has it been that long? Jeez! So, looking very likely l'll be headin' out to the West side on biz. Thought maybe we could grab some brews on the old expense account. Holler at me, dawg. You can message me here, or you can hit me up on my email. Peace. D Rock. Morning, Shelley. Hey, Dan. - James. -JERRY: Dan. (KEYS CLACKING) DAN: Los Angeles businesses. Drazen Partners. Voila. Kent Drazen. Hello, sir. (KNOCKING) - Bill, you got a sec? -Yeah, come on in. G01 a very exciting prospect. This firm in LA just fired their whole team. I got wind of it. Made a couple of calls. Ended up havin' a pretty substantial email exchange with the CEO, Kent Drazen. He wants me to fly out there and meet him. Here, check out the email. Kent Drazen. - Well, then I guess... -He's the CEO. - I pressed something... -Here, no problem. -L'll get it right back. Please. - There it is. -No. Forget it. - J ust... I don't... -ls that better? Are you sure? - No, no. -You can see it. Please. Well, right here, he says how he likes doing things the old-fashioned way, faoe to face. Reminds me ofyou, Bill. Hmm. And right here he says, "I would love to do business with your company." I mean, that's a strong email. You have an instinct here, Daniel? I do. This could be big. - Let's do it. -Yeah? Yeah. You book two tickets. Economy. Well, uh... Oh! You want to, uh... - Yeah, I should meet him. -Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, I hope it doesn't spook him, but... Well, why would it spook him? DAN: Yeah, right. Well, let me check the airlines. See if I can grab you a seat. Thursday flights, sold out, sold out, sold out. Cross-checking with the other carriers. Ugh! Nothing. And you can see that on the phone? Yeah, it's a new app. (SIGHS) We tried. Hold on. Looks like a solo mission this time. I got an idea. Let mejust call Roselle. She's been my travel agent... She's gonna be looking at the same screen I'm looking at. Never hurts to try. I got to tell you, I don't trust the web. Yeah. Roselle, please. - ZACH: You did a soul patch? -Yeah. - Zach, don't drag the suitcase. -Sorry. This is huge. You found this guy. Does Bill know that? Uh, yeah, he knows. Are you gonna have time to do anything cool, Dad? Zach' this is a business trip. Not a lot of room for dickin' around. Get the suitcase out, please. You're gonna kill it. I'm so proud of you. - Who was doubting himself? -I was. - And who told you that you shouldn't? -You did. (CHUCKLES) - I love you. -Love you. STACEY: Daddy's got a business trip.

Yeah, the thing about that is if it doesn't start as a group thing... - Mmm-hmm. -...it's tough to add someone later. Well, that makes sense.

Fifteen bucks a bottle, no big deal. Mmm. I fucking wouldn't sleep, man. Yeah, me neither. (SIGHS) Man, you ever feel like you're just... You'rejust lying to yourself? What do you mean? Well, when you lie to yourself, you lie to the whole world. And that's a shit heavy thing to carry around. It's like do you ever feel like you're so on the same page with someone that you don't even know what to say to that person? Huh? Ask me why I'm here, Oliver. Why I'm really here. You're here for your business meeting, right? Mmm-mmm. That's what my wife thinks. That's what my boss, who's sleeping right above us, thinks. But the truth is, I came here to get you to come to our high school reunion. I'm on the alumni committee, Oliver. I'm actually chairman of the damn thing. - Jesus. -And I told them if I got you to come, that everyone else would, too. I mean, you really think they'd give a shit? Are you kidding me? They would shit themselves. You're Oliver Lawless. Yeah, whatever that means. OKHY- Do you know what I did when I graduated high school? I went to community college. Down the street from high school. Took the first job I got. I never left home. I did what every other asshole did. - But not you. -Mmm? You said, "Fuck it." You went after your dream. Yeah. And you fuckin' fulfilled it. You're the Banana Boat spokesman? Excuse me? Banging hot chicks all over town. Boys with Mulroney. You are the best thing to ever come out of Barkledge, bro. By a long shot. And if you come to this ihing, you will be giving those people a gifi that they will remember for the rest of their pathetic lives. (SCOFFS) So wait. Whafd you tell your boss? 0h, no, no. I'm so fucked. I told... I told him that there's a CEO in town that wants to work with us. (CHUCKLING) Why would you do that? I didn't think he would come. It's so stupid. - What are you gonna do about it? -I don't know. But he's gonna find out that I made up the whole thing. (INHALES DEEPLY) Wait. Maybe he doesn't have to. And thank you, Mr. Drazen, for reconsidering. That's very kind of you. Well, first of all, call me Kent. Okay, let's just get that right out of the way. And can Ijust say? This man is a superstar. Did I tell you that already? He single-handedly got me excited about this, and I don't get exciied easy. Yeah, that's Daniel. Thanks, Mr. Drazen. Now, let me tell you why this deal still isn't gonna happen. - On. -(GROANS) I talked to the board this morning. We ran the numbers forward and backward. And, I mean, we really wanted to make this work, but sadly we are just maxed out right now. - Damn. -Yep. Now, here's what I propose. We put a pin in it. All right? We come back next fiscal when the flow's a little healthier. - We revisit. -I like that. That sounds good, thank you. Just hang on one second, Daniel. Um, I won't be able to sleep tonight if I don't say this, but there's got to be some way we can make this work. Bill, you know, they ran the numbers. The numbers have been run. Sorry. I'm very sorry. (SIGHS) Um... How about if we cut our fee? All right? 25%. That's very generous, but I'm afraid that still won't get it done. -50%. -Whoa. Bill, can we even... -(SHUSHING) -All right. Come on, Kent. We both know this deal makes sense. And this guy, I mean, he can deliver. So, um, Ijustdowt know how you can say no to this deal. Mmm-hmm. (OLIVER EXHALES) Man, I don't know what to say. Say yes. Okay, you got yourself a deal. BILL: Yes. Excellent. (CHUCKLES) OLIVER: This feels right. This makes sense. Wow. You see? Okay, um... Okay, well, I'm shaking. (CHUCKLES) I'm a little shaky as well. (BOTH LAUGHING) l'm gonna get the best champagne this place has. All right. - Fuck me! That was awesome! -Wow. I mean, wejust had a back and forlh that was like... ltjust fucking evolved, you know. That was great. - That was great. -I didn't go too far, did l? - I mean, that felt natural to me. -Yeah, I mean, you know, the part where you accepted the deal might have been a little bit. - Yeah' but Dan, it was real. -Oh, yeah. If I said no, it would've been false, totally false. He would have seen right through it. Maybe. I mean... I was buying the whole out-of-cash argument. God! It was fucking good, man. No, well, I mean... Nah, nah, nah, Dan. That's fine. You get to look great. Nobody gets hurt. Well, Bill... What? You kidding me? Look at him. He's having the time of his life. Guy couldn't be happier. - Yeah. -Come on, look. We're in the catbird seat. Okay? We can pull the plug whenever we want. Either way there's no deal. Just get that in your head. - No deal. -Okay. Why not let it sit for a little bit? Have a little fun with it. l dont know. - You know? -Yeah. - I mean, maybe you're right. -Maybe I'm right? Fuck you. Damn right I'm right. Damn right l'm right. Now, we're gonna celebrate. - Okay. -We're gonna drink some bubbly. - Yes, and then... - And have a good time. Tomorrow you call him and say... Yeah, whatever, we don't wanna do it. Yeah' A week from now, we'll do it tomorrow, but right now, we're not gonna think about it. Probably the sooner the better, but hey! Were gonna celebrate, right?

Well, you gotta ask him about it. This is all because of you. I know, Iwill. And what about Lawless? Did you get him to oome? What? Is he gonna come to the reunion? Possibly. I mean... He wants to, but it's a big expense. Have to fly him out here and put him up. - STACEY: What's this'? -Hmm? There are no buttons on this shirt. Hmm. That's weird. Were there buttons on there when you bought it? Yes, lwouldn't buy a shirt without buttons. So what goes on now'? People just try shit on and then throw it on the ground? Step on stuff and buttons come off, and they just put it on the rack and sell it? (SIGHS) Okay, I'll return it tomorrow. Are you gonna say somethin'? 'Cause something needs to be said to the manager. 'Cause that's fucking bullshit. OLIVER: (ON ANSWERING MACHINE) It's Lawless. Olli. D-Smooth. What's up, my brother'? Hey, that was some fuckin' fun ass shit out there in LA. The LA.

I mean, what if the deal falls through or somethin'? I mean, we haven't even signed the paperwork yet. No, no, no. It's as good as done. I'm a very good judge of people, and I trust Drazen. - Yeah, I do, too... -And guess what? I sent Dale Harkin an email. Get the fuck out of here. I did.

You go out there. You give him a call. He answers, you say what? Yeah, tell us how you turned him, Dan. You know, it was a very delicate dance, guys. It was just, I think, you know, the key was makin' it seem like it was his idea. How? - How? -Exactly. Yeah, how exactly did you do that? You know, I don't even really remember it. I just sort of flipped the script. Sort of like a reverse psychology and a subtle ihing I did, then all of a sudden he was eatin' out of the palm of my hand. Oh! "Dude, when is it, D... Slice. What do I wear? lwas like, "Calm down. "It's not for a few weeks. We'll be in touch. But, fuck, he's been blowin' me up ever since.

Zach? ls he upset? - I don't know. -ls he all right? I'll go check on him. DAN: No, honey, Olivers mid-story. STACEY: Zach? I can tell that story anytime. It's no big deal. STACEY: Zach? - Honey? Are you crying? -(DOOR SLAMS) Zach is really upset. You should talk to him. It's the girl stuff. He doesn't wanna talk to me about it. Okay, lwill. So, what was up with the whole Spicer thing? What? You came in with the name right away. What are you talking about? You guys were tryin' to think of Milhorn's name going back and forth, but then when Oliver and I were tryin' to do the drama teacher, you just came out and said it. You killed the whole thing. Killed what whole thing? I knew her name. I knew Milhorn's, but I still let you have fun with it. What is going on with you exactly? - What? -You are acting so weird. How am I acting weird? OLIVER: Dan, Wi-Fi password? - What? It's easier if I do it for him. -Yes, go. There's lots of numbers and letters, case-sensitive. Be right back. (SIGHS) (GAME BEEPING) - Hey, man. -Oh, hey, whafs up? Fmjust... Ijust got off the phone with your boss. What? He called you? Yeah, man, he called... Oh! Dude. - Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry. -(FLUSHING) So, how did he gel your number'? He said he had it from when I left him that message. He learned how to check his recent calls. Fuck, he's getting smarter. What did he say? He wanted to know where we were at and whether or not he should send paperwork. - Shit! -Yeah, this is out of control, man. Now, he is callin' me. You gotta put this thing to bed today. Oh, today? I was gonna hang with you. - I already called in sick. -No, no, no, man. You gotta handle ihis. It's uncool. Wait. Oliver'? Are you mad at me? What?

Consider it done. -(BABY CRYING) -She jusi didn't sleep, that's the problem. When she does... Dan? (TIRES SCREECHING) So we move our mouse to the search bar. This is... This is the mouse? That's the mouse. We click, and the cursor will appear. So, we just type "Bill..." Lower case? MAN: It doesn't matter, Bill. - Into the search bar here. -My screen looks different. DAN: Sorry 1o interrupt. Bill, can I steal you for one second? lt's important. Yeah. Can you just give me five minutes, please? Yeah, I'll be right outside the door. BILL: lthink I hit... Would you help him, please? - Enter. -Oh. Return. MAN: And click "Search." Hey, you all right? (SIGHS) What's with the pink? Well, this is my sisters room. My dad made me move in since you were 00min'. That sucks. I oould have stayed at Craig's. You should have told him to fuck off. I would never... Well, sometimes you got to, man. Even/body's got their line in the sand, you know? Right. All right, what else you got? - Well, my girlfriend, Heather? -Mmm-hmm? She wants to have a threesome. - Guy orgirl? -Girl. Okay. So, what's the problem? -L'm nervous. -About what? I think she thinks I'm more experienced than I am. How many girls have you fucked? None. Why? Well, I'm 14. Uh-huh. What does your dad say? You talked to him about it? I've tried. I feel like he's weird about sex stuff. Yeah. He thinks you should only have sex with someone if you love them. (EXHALES HEAVILY) You know what I think? I think you should find a way of loving both these girls. Simultaneously. Hey, what's goin' on? I'm in the middle of my Internet class. Did you call... Wait. What Internet class? Well, I gotta learn how to use these machines. Steve just taught us how to search for someone on Google. Okay, first of all, I'm not even sure thafs the best way to search for stuff. Google is kind of a dated thing, you know'? It all depends on what web browser you're using, and if the search engine is compatible. I don't wanna confuse... Hold on, didn't you call in sick? Yeah, l'm fine. l'm feeling much better. Did you call Drazen? Daniel' I cannot afford to get sick now. You're not gonna get sick. Did you call Drazen? Yeah, I called him just to check in. What's wrong? I wasjust checking in. Okay, I really wish you would run that kind of thing by me first. It turns out he did not love that call. - Why? -Because he's been dealing with me. Exclusively. He's been, you know, communicating with me. We got a rapport, and now, he just seems really rattled. Damn it, Bill. I'm sorry. It's okay. lfsjust I feel bad you spent all this money. Can you fix i1, please? - Please? -I don't know. I'll try. But I doubt it. He's genuinely pissed. - But I'll try. -I thank you. And again, I'm sorry, I just blew it. - But no more calls. -You know what? -L'm not calling anyone. -Okay. Ever. God damn i1. Sorry, guys. So you're kissin' Heather, right? Focus on her. She's number one. You don't let her forget that. But you also don't want ihe other girl... - What's the other girl's name? -Jill. Jill. Now, you clon't want Jill to feel left out. - Of course. -All righi? So you're gonna do one these guys. Okay, that makes sense. Okay'? Now, let's say, things are heating up. Clothes start 00min' off. We're fucking. Obviously, you got one cock. So you can't do 'em both a1 the same time, -right? -Right. We wanna try and get as close as possible. How? You stack 'em. Yeah, man, like, lawn chairs, one on top of the other. - Like lawn chairs? -Think about it. Visualize it. - Works. -Okay. 0h, hey. Don't forget. Wear a condom. Right. Then rip that thing off. Hose down those lawn chairs. Sure. OLIVER: (ON ANSWERING MACHINE) It's Lawless. Yo, yo, yo. What's up, dawg? It's the D Man. Just wanted you to know, the Bill sitch? Handled, dawg.

They were just going out. - They? -STACEY: Yeah. Craig already came by to pick him up. We all had a drink together, and then they left. I said that you would text him when you got home. Yeah, I've been texting, Sbace. I've been texting. OLIVER: (ON ANSWERING MACHINE) It's Lawless. Hey, um, it's getting late. I guess you're still out. Not getting texts. If you could just let me know, maybe ballpark when you're gonna... Or whatever. I can just leave a key underthe mat. The one right at the front door. I'll leave it under there. All right. Hope you're having fun. Good night, Oliver. (TIRES SCREECHING) OLIVER: Whoo! (LAUGHS) (ENGINE REWING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) OLIVER: Man, this is our night, okay. WOMAN: Bye, Craig. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (ENGINE REWING) (WOMAN YELPS) - CRAIG: Later. -OLIVER: Looking good. - WOMAN: Later. -CRAIG: Later, dudes. (GLASS SHATTERING) WOMAN: I don't know if he'll kill me. (LAUGHS) OLIVER: Don't worry about it. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Oh! (MOANING) (KNOCKING) Shit. Are we being 10o loud? - A little. -Okay. Sorry, bro. We'll try and keep it down. Actually... - Hi. -Hi. Can I talk to you for a second? Right now? Mmm... Yeah, man. (GRUNTS) What's up? Sorry. So, is everything okay between us? What do you mean? I don't know, I'm just feeling a little bit of a distance. Has something changed that I'm not aware of? I mean, maybe we should talk about it. I don't know, we haven't really talked about what happened. I mean, l'm kind of in the middle of something, you know? All right, sit down. Fuck me. - Dan, LAwas fun. We did it up. -Mmm-hmm. Bui it was a one-time thing. Oh, yeah. I know, totally.

So, uh, what were we laughing about? Z-Bone's got himself a big night lined up. Z-Bone? What is that? Nickname I gave the kid. I don't think that works at all. He's going to have his first threesome. What? (LAUGHING) OLIVER: Right? I mean, lwas 16 before I did that. - Did what? -Nothing. Oh! (CHUCKLES) Alyssa, would you like some potatoes? Mmm. Yes. I would love some. Thank you, Stacey. OLIVER: Hey, man, you're ready to go. So, where is this supposed to go down? At Heathers. Tomorrow night. Mmm-hmm. And where are her parents? Oh. They are going to be at your reunion. 0h, they are? That's perfect. - Yeah, it totally is. -Yeah, it actually is. So, I'm just the last to find out about this? - No, man. Stace doesn't know. -ZACH: Please donHell her, Dad. Hey, he's not gonna tell her, dude. He's cool. Yeah, I'm cool. But I should have known about this. I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen, so I asked Oliver. 0h, so you encouraged this? - Yeah, why wouldn't l? -He's 14. What are you gettin' so upset about, Dan? You should be celebrating this. He's a stud. (ALYSSA LAUGHING) - You know what? I want you out of here. -What? You heard me. I want you out of this house! Dan! Stacey, this does not concern you. -It's okay, Stacey. -No, it is not okay. It is okay! Maybe I overstayed my welcome. L'm gonna get my things and crash at Craig's. STACEY: I am so sorry, Oliver. Dan, what is the matter with you? LUCY: So sorry... S0 you can see that the ladies are on the dance floor underneath this beautiful railing. If you get a chance later, have a free moment of time, come and check out the model. It's almost to scale. Uh, If you actually could hold on that for a second, Luce'? Thank you so much. Uh, ljust got a text from Lawless, and he needs the password to the Facebook page. - What does he need it for'? -Jesus Christ. He wants to post a photo of us from last night. Who gives a fuck? Dan, you're not the gatekeeper of the Facebook page. Please give him the password. Oliver is not a commiiiee member, Lucy. Yeah, but Craig is. But he's just gonna give it to him, Jerry. No, lwon't give it to him. Because I can only give it to people who are on the committee. Okay, everyone heard him say that. You're on record. (SIGHS) Okay, fine. R-E... U-N... l... O... - N. -li's reunion? - With three exclaims on the end. -Good password. Randy, come take a look. (LAUGHING) 0h, look. He's doing it. Uh, no, we're talking about something else entirely. Oh, Really? What are you talking about? Just give me a second. -L'm gonna shit myself! -(LAUGHING) CRAIG: Me 10o. (LAUGHING) Okay, you know what? This has gone offihe rails, and what are we doing? We're giving passwords to non-committee members, we're letting them upload unauthorized photos. Dan, I'm gonna ask you to calm down. Lucy, I'm totally calm. What the fuck is going on here? This is ridiculous. Okay? It's one guy and we're gonna build the whole fucking thing around him? -It was your idea. -DAN: What the fuck? What the fuck do you care? Renina' you never ever talk, and now you pipe in? - She's right, Dan. We... -DAN: Okay, so what? So I made a mistake. Am I not allowed to make a mistake? Am I not human? This reunion is for everybody. It's for all of us! Notjust him! God! (SIGHS) (LAUGHING) Okay. Announcement. Ithink I'm out, guys. - All right, man. -No, I mean, out-out. No, we get it. We know what you meant. You know, it's honestly fine. I mean, all the work's done, so... DAN: Okay. LUCY: Anyway... - What that? -Yeah, look, and then... (LAUGHING) ls there a picture of just me and him? (MUSIC PLAYING FROM PHONE) (KNOCKING) - Hey, Daniel. -DAN: Hey, Bill. (MUSIC STOPS) Are you okay? A lot of stuff, Bill. Yeah, well, l hate to pile on more, but we got a problem because I am 90% sure that this is not the guy we met with. And I do not know what is going on. But I think we're being duped in some way. And see, when I click this like Steve said, the picture stays the same. Now, if I could enlarge this, then we would know who this is. But I can't. I don't know. There's no way to enlarge this. Yeah, there's no way to enlarge it. Right? (SIGHS) BILL; Fuck. Maybe if I hi1 this. No. - Bill. -Yeah. There is a way to enlarge it. That's not him. No. It isn't. And Google is a great way to search for stuff. It's actually the best engine out there. What? And you can add someone to an email chain at any point. It's so easy. Daniel, whafs going on? I lied to you. There's no deal in LA. Kent Drazen isn't real. The guy you met, his name is Oliver Lawless. And he was the coolest guy in my high school, and I just wanted to go out there and convince him to come to the reunion. You faked a deal? So you could take a trip to LA? Why didn't you just buy a ticket and go out on the weekend? Yeah. Yeah. In retrospect, that would have been a lot easier. But I needed an excuse for my wife, so... Okay. I got you. So, couldn't you have just told her it was a business trip, and left me out of it? I could have. I oould have. I could have done that. (smume) Actually, I'm not sure why I didn't. (smume) So what now'? I mean, I assume I'm fired. Fired from what? I don't even know if we have a company anymore. Right. I spent so much money... I know, right. Right. I don't know what to say, Bill. I mean, I'm so sorry. I never meant for it to go this far. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) You know what's funny? I actually liked Drazen. Idid, too. Yeah, and' I don't know, itjust felt good, you know, chasing the big fish again, you know. He liked you, Bill. That was real. It wasn't real. Well, right, I mean, he wasn't really Drazen, but... Did you get him? Who? Yourfriend, Lawless. Igot him. Good. Bill, are we cool? Have fun at the reunion, Daniel. (MUSIC PLAYING) - Ready? -Yep. Dan, this is gorgeous. Stacey Polster. 0h my God! -0h, my God! Wendy Fleur. How are you? I'm good. It's actually Stacey Landsman now. You remember Dan? Hi, Wendy. Hi. We had Spanish and Chemistry. Oh! (CHUCKLES) I'm gonna go get some drinks. - Oh, okay. Perfect. Thanks. Just a white wine. Yeah, um, two. OLIVER: Yeah, Lawless crew. (LAUGHS) H9'!- - Dan. -Dale Harkin. What's up, buddy? We're gonna be seeing you next week, right? Hey, I hear big things are happening over there. You know, Shurmur tried to FaoeTime me the other day. I didn't even know the old man had a phone. Yeah. Hey, did I hear right? That you got Lawless here? Yeah, I might have had somethin' to do with that. Nice job, dude. Oh, man. Hey, not to sound gay or anything, but I always thought he was just the shit. Like I would've done anything to have been his friend, you know? Yeah. Anyway, let's get fucked up, right? Yeah. Hey, Dan. Hey, fuckin' A, guys' you did it. (SIGHS) (CUP CLATTERS) How you doin'? I'm fucking great. How are you doin'? Smoking? You know, whatever, I smoke when I drink, sometimes I'll have a smoke. What's the big deal? - Are you okay? -l'm fucking great. It's a party. You know what? l'm partyin'. Just loosen the fuck up. Who are you right now'? You're wasted! You're obsessed with Oliver. Wearin' the same underwear as him. How do you know what kind of underwear he wears? - You fuckin' him? -What? Idid his laundry, Dan. (DOOR CLOSES) (SNORTING) (GRUNTS) (DOOR OPENS) - Dan. -Jerry. Was that cocaine? Come here. OKHY- Jerry, Jerry, Jerry- Let me ask you somethin'. How about this? 41mm. -What? Have peoplejust call me that from now on? Uh... I don't know. It feels forced. It's a little bit forced. That's what I was thinkin', too. Okay, come on, give me some options. - Pitch me out some new ones. -I don't know. You just have to find what works for you, you know? Like me, it's J-Dawg. It's obvious. Fuck. You've got it all figured out, don't you? Don't you? I don'i know. I don't think. You have such an easy life, J-Dawg. Let's go back to the party, okay? Yeah, let's gei back in. J-Dawg wants back in. (LAUGHING) Why wouldn't he? Whoo-hoo! Holly James! Lovebirds back together. Who is this guy? - You all right, Dan? -(MUMBLES) ls that it? You're noi gonna say hi? You're here because of me, and you're not gonna say hi? That's pretty fuckin' rude. Why don't you go sit down for a little bit, buddy? How was Craig's house? Bye, Dan. You're gonna fuck that pussy? That tight puss? He said you have one. Probably not anymore though, right? - Probably gotten a little loose. -All right, let's go. - What are you doin'? -Excuse us for a sec. Where are we goin'? Are you gonna...

(MUSIC STOPS) OKHY- What do you wanna talk about' Dan? - You know what I wanna talk about. -Yeah? And what do you wanna hear? Huh? You wanna hear that I wanna be with you? What, Oliver, wait, why did the music stop? Would that do it for you, Dan? Tell me. You wanna hear that I can't stop thinkin' about when we fucked? DAN: No, no. Outside. OLIVER: That I'm rock hard right now just thinkin' about it? How's that? Oh, Dan, I can't wait to get my dick back in your mouth. I'm so dying to make you come, since you didn't last time. How's that? Maybe thafs what you're lookin' for. - Oliver... -No, no, no, let's fuckin' talk, man! You wanted to do this. Let's talk. Let's get some closure. How do we end this? How's this?

(SCHOOL BELL RINGS) ZACH: Hey, babe. - Hey, Mr. Landsman. -Hey, Heather. Heard about last night. 0h, you did? Great. Well, it's pretty epic. It's all over Facebook. I1 is? Yeah, you're fucked up, dude. I like it. Oh. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. (EXHALES HEAVILY) CRAIG: It was so awesome havin' you here' man. What a great weekend. Hey, it was weird all that shit you blasted Dan with last night in front of everybody, but you know, (CHUCKLES) classic Lawless. Thanks for the material. That stuffs gonna last us for years. For years. Yeah. Guys. Buddy. - I could've fucked either one of you. -Mmm-hmm. At any point. But I didn't. Why is that? All right, fellas. (ENGINE STARTS) (SIGHS) (DOOR SQUEAKS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) So there were buttons on that shirt when I bought it. And I yelled at that manager for no reason. Yeah. How did the buttons come off the shin, Dan'? (smume) He ripped 'em off. Hmm. Yeah. (EXHALES) Stace, I'm not... So, what was it, Dan? Can you please explain it to me? I wish I could. I don't... If you had asked me two weeks ago what the odds of this happening... 0h, my God. Stop. I'm just tryin' to talk about it. I mean, to deal with it. You know? I mean, because we have to. Right? (DOORBELL RINGS) Fuck! (SNIFFLES) (SIGHS) ls this a bad time? Um... What are you doin' here? I wasjust headin' out and, uh... I don't know, I kind of feel like I needed to apologize. - I said some things... -Yeah, we heard them. Look, Stace, you gotta know, I did this. Not Dan. It was all me. Is that supposed to make me feel better? Well, can I at least come in? I'll come out. It's okay. Dude, listen to me. Last night, rippin' you to shreds like that, it was... It musfve been embarrassing for ya. I'm sorry. Well, thanks for saying that. In LA, I treated you like a piece of meat, man. -It wasn't right. -Yeah. Uh... Thanks for that as well. I don't wanna be doin' that. You know, I don't wanna be that guy. Yeah, I don't wanna be the guy I was in that scenario. It's just you put me up on this pedestal' you know? It was like... I don't know, it was a lot of pressure to deal with. It kind of made me feel like I needed to play the part. Didn't wanna let you down. "Play the part"? Dan... (CHUCKLES) You gotta open your eyes, man. I'm a mess. That Banana Boat spot... It's patheiic. That's a national spot. You saw my apartment, man, l'm broke as shit. I don't know fuckin' Dermot Mulroney. But I saw you guys. I mean, he's a super down-to-earth dude. He's fucking normal as hell, but he didn't have a clue who I was. Because we'd never met. I'm nothing, man. I peaked in the 11th grade. Hang on one second. -(HONKING) -CAB DRIVER; Hey, Mac. - Relax, man. -I am relaxed. You wanna miss your flight, I don't give a fuck. It's on you. Your call. Yeah. Whafs that? It's yours. I borrowed it. After you fucked me. And you probably don't remember. It's just a blip on your radar, but... (SIGHS) Keep it. You weren'tjust a blip, Dan. Even if I was. OLIVER: Take care of yourself, pal. DAN: Dear Grant Bark/edge, class of '94. Fun times last night. Although I do apologize for my personal life taking center stage like it did. That was unexpected. Had a great DJ who, if you ask me, got unfairly overshadowed. Sorry about that, Tyler. But it's funny. I brought it all on myselt I thought if I could deliver Oliver Lawless, I'd be a hero. Single-handedly saving our reunion. But we didn't need him, did we? We didn't need the most popular guy from high school. We didn't need the face of a national Banana Boat campaign. We needed a symbol of something more. And I, for one, was ready to risk everything I had for the chance to find it. Bu! it took all this to make me realize Oliver Lawless was inside me all along. There's a Lawless inside all of us. Sometimes you just gotta give him a little nudge and wake him up. After! post this update and leave you all ample time to read it, I will be deactivating this Facebook account. For! am the only one in possession of the new password. But I shall leave you with this. Be grateful for what you have and you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never ever have enough. That's Oprah Winfrey for you right there. Tel/in' it like i! is. Goodbye, old friends. I'll see you all on the other side. And I will forever be your chairman of the alumni committee. Daniel Gregory Landsman aka The D Train.
