Can you get the money by yourself? And you'll just spend it all the way out. Save some for yourself. Brother, you got a car?. Car?. No. What do you usually go out by? Underground. What if after 12:00 a.m.? Walking! Last time, I did walk home from station. What? How's that? No girls love boxing these days. You got to follow the trend, like, telling jokes. What? Take me as clown? What clown? Forget it. Brother. Mimi. You didn't bring me the photo. Have I introduced before? Brother, I met a nice guy. Look that way, the man in brown. The one sitting... Don't stick around with that bastard. That would ruin your life. I have told you, you must trust me... Hello! You are the boxer, right? Not anymore. Did my wife order you to follow me? I got lots of great pictures here. Why did you show it to me? Nothing serious. Im just little short lately. Do-chul, come here. Hey! Cheong Kit Why did you come? Nothing. Why are you here? Tell me, why are you here? Just tell me. Nothing, I just get paid for this. How much can you get? Your boss just know how to exploit his staff. None of your business. Do you know what exploitation is? Don't know. Hey! Don't run. We meet again. Want to be an actress? No. Everybody asks me that. You want to hear?. Yes. I don't want to, you'll tease me if I tell you. I won't, come on. No way. But, you should see. Im confident. Your nose is bleeding. Thanks. That's okay, it happens sometime. I just can't sleep after the match. Im just too excited thinking... What? Woman? Thinking of what I should eat not to put on weight. That's bad for not eating enough after match. I got to go, Ive an appointment. Wait for second. I call you brother next time. You're so early, I just saw Mimi. Hong-gi... What's up to you Don't want to see me? Hong-gi. Let me go. What happen to your face? Told you to let me go. Who did this? Who? Leave me alone. How dare you? I gave you all these and treat you so well. You turn on to my back? Bastard! Give me your mobile car keys and office keys. Then get the hell out of here. Not you. You got work to do We got to collect some debts lately. Im leaving also. Thanks for doing that for me! Its not for you, sucks! I used to be in absolute loyalty to friend when I was young. I will do everything for friends. Ive been in gangs too. Ever since I practice boxing, I pull myself out. It pays well for boxing. Why are you so money-minded? I can buy a house for myself if I have money. Money can fulfill one's dream. How much do you know about boxing? How much do you know? That kid is... I haven't been there before. Why? You won't learn life experience in school. You got to learn it in everyday life. Your school result should the same as mine. You didn't go to college, right? I did. You did? Just a few days Because I do great in sport. Even the dumb ones can go to college. So I don't need that. Ill open one myself if I have money. I got to gather those who did bad in school and make them as teachers. What do you think? Ill just walk over the rich. Don't you plan for your life? Just hang around? I don't want to be with you. Don't ever look for me. You just do what you want to. You heard about Cheng Tsik? Someone told him that no matter what's happening at the back. Don't ever look back. He's so dumb to look back. There comes the result. Why? Its because of curiosity. That's why I told you to trust me. Trust me then you can... You like to bullshit. Its really annoying. You know Hung Shing? Chu Tsik's brother he won't get matured. - Yeah. - Right. Hung Shing is about to lose in the game... but he's still working hard on it... What did you say? He finally made the fortune. So, one wants to get rich, got to... Shut up, shit, I just forgot. Leaving? I bring you to ball tomorrow. No. Mimi will go too. Hello! Im Chiu Hong-gi. You know Mimi well? When did you arrive, Mimi?

It won't do us good. Just go. Be careful. Did you contact her?. Who? That's Mimi! Why do I need to? You haven't told me how much is the medical fee? Its all here, that's all I can do. You can only take this that's your fault. One million? Then what? What's this? What? This is... Mobile phone, it's brand new. What is it? Take off your clothes. Take it off. Don't you trust me?

I drank too much. You hang with Hong-gi so I call you. Can you do me a favor?. Im looking for him badly! You turn your face. Oh? I want to look at your side way. Sau King, not everyone can be actor. How's your acting? Ive no experience. Should be, first time? You know, ''Legend of hero''? You like what you are doing? Not really. Why you keeping telling me not to do it? Didn't you see shit people like me? You think that, too? You think Im better than you? Do I have a car or house? Be frank, you're not for boxing. Im sorry to say that.

Not now. Didn't you say Im ready? Okay, just one. No way. Watch out. Shing Ho is the title champion for years, you'd know. You got to stay through to the 4th round. Or it'd be shit. Left punch, harder. Okay, stop. Do you think I will lose to Shing Ho? He's not like before. Its a miracle if you can stay through 4 rounds. Its an important show. Although it's not confirmed yet, I think Ill go great. This match is important too. If I win this match there're lots coming. What are you doing? I got to sleep now. Why are you listening to such song? That's uncivilized. Get some music on. Is that cool? How about this? Won't charge you just lend it to you. Thanks, brother. Ming Kwok's looking for you.

We need to bring Do-chul with us. Without him, it's useless. I got you a present, friend. You said you quit from Mr. Man. Why are you urging me to go? You should know I won't go. Don't you need money? How can you make a living with no money? And the chance of winning for this match is small. Am I correct? You think Ill lose? Yes, everybody thinks that. No one thinks that Ill win. You really think so? No kidding! Wanna know who's winning? Let's see Im confident for the match. Ill win for sure. You're winning, so what? How much you get? How many matches you need to be the champion? You know my reason going for the match? Think I need that badly? It's because of money, right? No, certainly not. l... I don't know how to say.

Im leaving, you get in. Get in, Do-chul. Get on, kid. You're stubborn. Stay away from the rain. You'll get sick. I won't force you to do that. Im not doing it either. I don't want you to catch cold. That's not good to yourself. That's okay for not doing it. Lee Do-chul! He made a right punch. Then come with a left punch. That's exciting. The opponent dies to run. Come on. The title champion we're expecting is now come... The fierce punch from the opponent hit Lee's nose. And Lee's nose is broken.. The match won't end that soon. We need to wait for another round. Get on the car, forget what I said. Ill do it. - Bye. - Bye. Leaving? Since I left home at 17 Ive been doing all kinds of work. Who send you guys here? That bastard owes us money. He didn't pay back, that's the result. The shithead like him should let him know what pain is. If I have one million, I can do everything. Do-chul, you listen. The smart one will grasp the chance as it comes. I know we can't live for dream. I need to live for myself. You're lying, shit. You took the money wanna bilk that? Ming Kwok talked about you. I didn't tell him. Just concentrate on this, don't worry. Let's see, six more years Ill be getting on. Ill give you when you're done. I gave my word, make it quick. Son. Mom, Im here.

Do-chul, don't fight anymore, it's done. Make way. Is money so important? If you buy this house, you'll earn 500 thousands. To have money, you can enjoy your life every day as you like. Then, what do you think? Get going, quick... Haven't you got the money? Don't want it, shit! Mom, my mom. She died 2 years ago. Ill sleep in the gym tonight. I need to go somewhere. Talk about it tomorrow. Im sorry about that. Did your stuff go smooth? No, am I really that shit? Is this a dream to me being an actress? You really think so? Brother! What's happening? Im supposed to cast for a cosmetic advertisement. But they get me changed.. Im not upset, because I know too well. How much is this? Can I buy for $50? That's all I have. Ill lose $50 if I sell it to you at $50. Don't look down upon others. What did you say? How old are you? None of your business, how's that? Your parents let you see this?
