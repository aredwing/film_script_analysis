Sirs, this is Clint Loman, the chief of our expedition. Hans Mller and Joe Stark, two veterans of the jungle. Doctor Schwarz. I hope to never have need of him. Professor Dawson, geologist and diamond expert. Nancy Wyler, his secretary. Alain Duval and Pierre Moreau, two men whom you'll find very useful. Have I heard of you? It's possible. Well, I think everything's clear. However, it's best to recap the situation. Will you take a seat? I beg you. The boat will dock here, on the Borneo coast, at Bandung. You'll travel through the jungle to the village of Sumiyaki, where you will wait for the boat which will take you up the river Sarawac to the falls. Your guide will be Kama, a Malay. He knows the river very well, you'll find him useful. Beyond the falls, probably in this area, should be found the fabulous diamond deposits. Of course, you might not find anything. The stories of large diamonds we've heard from the natives could be pure fantasy. In that case, I'd be the only loser. I've already paid you a tidy sum to participate in this expedition. If you find the diamonds, half of the fortune will be split between you, and the other half will go to poor Mr. Wang. That should be reasonable. Like always, Mr. Wang. I've known you a long time, and I trust you, but this time, the job is tough. Diamonds can easily corrupt the most loyal men. Once again, I think I make myself clear. Like always, Mr. Wang. But my fears are not justified. I have the means to find anyone, wherever he might hide. At your service, Mr. Wang. All is ready, captain? Yes, we can leave tomorrow. Perfect. This is captain Santor, the boat commander who will lead you to the isle of Borneo. You will leave tomorrow at dawn. Gentlemen, good luck until we meet again, I hope. Ready to lower the sails! Hurry! Prepare to drop anchor! Tie the ropes to the hull. If all goes well, captain, we will be back in 2 months. The porters will accompany you to the river. Has someone alerted Kama, the Malay who will take us to the falls? Yes, he awaits you at Sumiyaki with a motorboat and all the necessary equipment. Good luck. Thank you, captain. Let's go. You think we'll find this diamond mine? All comes to those who wait. Move ahead! It's not for the diamonds that I am here, but for the spirit of adventure. I hope I can be of some use. I've never been in the jungle but I know of the dangers. Me, I've been. Quite often. But I don't know all its dangers. Always watch your back. Alcohol? Yes, only medicinal. Ahead! There's the river. I'm Kama. I'll take you to the falls. Let's go. If anyone wants to turn back, it's now or never. Later, it will be too late. Load the cargo. Careful. Careful, gently. To starboard. We mustn't run aground. Gently now, there isn't much depth. Don't hit the propeller. We have to stop, it's getting dark. Night falls quickly in the jungle. Kill the engine. Dock. Slightly to port. Gently. It looks tranquil. We'll camp here. Pitch the tents. Kama... Monitor that side. I'll keep watch here. I'll come with you. You should stay with the others. I'd rather stay near you. I'd feel safer. Don't move. We're in no danger. They're fighting. That's the law of the jungle. It's always the strongest who survive. What happened? What did they say? Nothing. They looked terrified. They fled. We must be close to their village. Hurry. Pack up the tents. They said there were Kayaques down river. Kayaques? Headhunters! They've never come here before. We have to avoid them at all costs. Once night falls, it's impossible to navigate. We leave at dawn. Nancy... Are you crazy? Get out and... What's going on? Nothing. He ran into something. Yeah, a punch. - Back to bed, Stark. - Yes. - You're on watch, Mller. - Good. That won't happen again, so stay quiet. - You got a light? - Sure. Why are you here, Nancy? Why participate in this absurd expedition? Why absurd? You don't think we'll find anything? You don't have to answer my question. For a long time, professors have studied Borneo from a geological point of view. He is more interested in that than any diamonds. And you? Me, the diamonds interest me, Clint. Very much. I've watched you. I'm trying to understand who you are, and how you think. And do you understand? I think so. You've never wanted to stop for a moment. Maybe. You've thought about marriage? No, I've never had the time. Don't move! Don't look down! A tom-tom! What's going on? It's a signal for danger. How? What danger? The tribe of savage Kayaques is gathering. They descend to the river. The Kayaques? They're headhunters! No one told me about this danger. I want to leave. It's too late. You were warned. You already knew yesterday when we saw the natives. You should have let us know! I want to find the diamonds, Dr. Schwarz. We're taking the river to the falls. At any cost. Will they attack us? Hurry, Kama... It'll be dark soon. We'll take turns on guard. First Mller and myself. Stark and Alain, in two hours. Over there, Mller. Help! He's dead. They're still here. I can't take it. I want to leave! They won't get me. They won't get me! Stop! Where are you going? You're crazy! Stop! Clint, the crocodiles! Hurry, help them out. Over here, quick. Moreau might be right. Let's go back. Of course I'm right. They'll kill us all... all! We were all tricked! We're all deluded! There are no diamonds here, only this jungle of doom! We're going to rot like worms! Look! Look what I found. - It's a piece of diamond. - We're on the right track. - Of course! - I always said that. If there's sediment here, then upstream there will be more diamonds. Am I right? Of course, Alain. Well? Shall we continue? We'll be rich, Alain, you understand? Thank you, Professor, and bravo on your sense of timing. A providential intervention. I'm just curious. What's this, a... diamond? A piece of lapillus vitrus fluminis. Commonly called "volcanic glass." Do you want a souvenir? I can't say, but we've come a long way. We must not be far from the falls. Do you think that after the falls, we'll be in safe territory? No one can say, Dawson. Why? No one has ever passed the falls, that's why! He's a good guy, huh? What has he done so far? For starters, he put Moreau in his place. Sooner or later he'll get his. I'm in no hurry. I can wait. Later, he might have need of you. That's debatable. But what is there to gain? First we find the diamonds, then we'll talk. The rapids! Dock. Turn off the motor. - We're approaching the falls. - Finally! Take a look there, Moreau. The tom-toms have stopped, maybe it's peaceful here. Maybe, but it's better to stay on our guard. From here, we continue on foot. Tie up the boat and unload it. Here, the falls! We have to get beyond them. Let's try that way. Which way to take? We have to split up. Stark, Moreau, Schwarz and Kama, try that way. We'll go that way. At nightfall, we all return here. Let's go. This way. This way. To cover, quickly! They're under attack! Quick! Get away from him, quick! Forward! They're attacking from behind! Over here! We were attacked! Quick, behind the rocks! Where's Kama? He's dead. Give me another clip. Look out, Clint! More are coming! They fled. There weren't a large number of them. Maybe they wanted to test our forces. They'll return for sure, and in greater numbers. We have to find a way past the falls. Otherwise, all is lost. Let's get our things and go. Stop, don't shoot. Quick, follow me. Who are you? How do you know our language? I will explain. You are in danger, come on. There. The Kayaques never leave the jungle. The falls scare them. Finally some good news. Now, where are you taking us? To the top of the mountain, to my village. No, hold on! Who's to say it's not a trap? She showed up after the natives fled, she could be their accomplice. She might be part of the same tribe. Why should she be trusted? Thank you, Nancy. All in all, we have no other choice. Come. There, that is my village. The grand chief wishes you welcome. He asks the reason for your trip to the heart of the island. My comrades and I are doing research on the age and formation of the South Seas islands analyzing rocks and minerals in the soil. You need rest. His son Daran will accompany you. We will talk later of your trip. Come. Professor... should we start here? Yes. We'll split up as intended. The diamond streams must be there. See you back at the village. Let's go, Alain. You try that side. What marvelous scenery. I don't know why, but it seems familiar to me. Maybe I've seen it in a dream. Look. Take the other one, leave me with Samoa. She may know about the diamonds. Me, Alain... And you? Jasmine. Me, Alain... No. Me, Alain. Me, Alain... you, Jasmine. Me, Alain... And me, Samoa. Why do you speak our language? I am the daughter of a white man who lived here. He married a native. She is dead. My father died also, shortly after. But he taught me his language. Who was your father, what was he doing here? He was a strange man. He was searching for something here. Then he fell in love with his "paradise" and he stayed. What was he looking for, exactly? I don't know. Maybe the same thing as you. What do you think? You're very beautiful, Samoa. After our survey, the situation is clear. Several streams converge at the falls. Some don't run for part of the year, and I doubt they contain any diamonds. The others run continuously. And? If Mr. Wang's indications are correct, those are the streams that interest us. Tomorrow at dawn, we'll begin to sift the stream. - It's Clint. - One moment. At dawn, we begin our research. You plan to bring this native, Samoa? No. Why? If I were you, Clint, I'd avoid her. I'd stay as far aways as possible. Doc, a hundred bucks says I find the first diamonds! I'll take that bet, Alain. Sample no 15. Presence of crystallized minerals and traces of quartz sand. You find anything? Still nothing. In this sample, traces of wolframite, uraninite and perhaps molybdenite. No fancy words, Professor. Are there diamonds, yes or no? I am a geologist, Mr. Moreau, not a diviner. Moreau is impatient, like all of us. We risked our hides to get here. Is there any hope? No one can say. Well, until tomorrow. What are you doing here? Clint... I've been waiting. Why did you come? So? Nothing. Dawson, look at this. Professor, did you find any diamonds? In this area, no. Maybe further upstream. There are only rocks here! We've already searched here. It turned up nothing. We have to go farther in. But where? The river has dozens of branches. And they extend over 200 km. Tomorrow, we'll try the other side. Let's go. What luck... He fell into the water. - Who, Dawson? - Yes. - And then? - I managed to grab hold of him. - Who is that woman? - Who, Nancy ? That's Dawson's secretary, a nice girl. Why are you interested in her? I always see her with you. Take it! Where's Alain? Haven't seen him all day. Me... Love... Alain. Nothing. So we keep trying. Tomorrow, we stick to the river branches. To go where? - Into the jungle, north of the falls. - That's 200 km! An unknown area, more dangerous than the one we traversed. Dawson's right. There's no way, Clint! This expedition is folly. I say we continue tomorrow. You're a fool! You can't make us. Go where you like. As for us, we're turning around. I'm the chief. And only I decide what we do. You think so? The diamonds! I've seen them! Enormous, very beautiful! Thousands of them! You found them? Where? In a cave. Jasmine showed me the way. There's a fetish, and then, a mountain of diamonds! - A mountain! - Show us! - Come! - Let's go. What are you doing? These are the stones of life that the river has provided. They protect us from diseases, accidents and war. These are sacred stones. Put them down, Moreau. Leave, everyone. You came looking for these? No. I have a bad feeling. Your friends might not be sincere. Something isn't right about them. Don't worry, Samoa. Nothing will happen. We'll leave soon. Why don't you stay here? I'm not sedentary. I could stay one month, maybe two. But then, I would have to leave. Understand? I understand. But I don't want to lose you. I'll take you with me. I love you. So, what do you intend? You're asking us? We've risked our hides a thousand times to let these stupid natives have such a fortune? Anyone who keeps us from the diamonds will get shot. Do you agree? That works for me. Stark? I agree. And you, Alain? What do you think we should do? I haven't decided yet. I might stay here. Here? Are you crazy? Maybe. But I'm finally happy. That is my purpose in life. And I'm not here to steal. What do you mean by that? You'd betray us? Don't worry. Do what you want. - I'll be off then. - Good! One less person to share. But would Clint agree? We'll deal with him. We have to hurry... We've chosen to take the diamonds. Well, that's what I decided too. I was about to say that. Then we're all agreed. Do you have any idea how to go on from here? Huh... We don't know the passages in these caves. How can we pass the falls and reach the river? Once they find out, the natives will catch up quickly. Well then? Don't worry, Moreau. You never wondered why I got along so well with Samoa? You're clever, you are. When do we take action? Tomorrow. There's a party in the village. We won't disturb anybody. Are you...sad? What...do you think? Let's go! No time to waste! Someone's coming! Don't shoot or they'll hear. Take the diamonds. Quick, out! Here come the others! Here they are! I'm going to find Samoa. Wait for me at the forest entrance. We have to go, quickly! - What's happening here? - No questions! - Why now? - Shut up! We'd better fly or we're dead, myself included. Cries of alarm. What happened? Come on. Don't waste time. Let's find Nancy and Dawson. Where did they run to? There are your friends! Quick! Let's go. - And the diamonds. - Got them. What do they want? To return the stones of life. Are you crazy? Stop! Alain, don't move or you're dead! Tell your people to release Alain. Come on. You can't stay, they'll kill you! He said the jungle will avenge them. The falls! Come on, quick! My task is complete. You're safe and sound. But I can't come with you. I betrayed my people. Your people are unforgivable, they're greedy and unscrupulous. I've always known the value of those stones. My father also came because of them. Get in. No, I'm staying here. I told you to get in! But where are we going? This way, they won't find us here. It's a secondary branch. With a little luck, we can avoid the headhunters. You don't think there's too many to share the diamonds? I agree, there's too many. Clint, the headhunters! They're in our way! Here come the others! We're trapped! Land, it's our only hope! Alain, land, quickly! Get to cover. Over there. Don't shoot, it's Stark. Careful! We can't last much longer. Night is falling. A few hours of respite. The natives fear the night more than any enemy. Samoa, careful! We'll bury Alain here, in the jungle. Why did you force me to follow you? Your people want vengeance, even from you. A just punishment, perhaps. Maybe so, but I prefer you safe and sound, and by my side. Stand up, both of you! Take the diamonds, Schwarz! Out! - Them too. - What's going on? Come on and shut up! Watch them! Moreau, Schwarz ! You can't leave us here! Take the diamonds, but bring us too! I can't get it to start. Schwarz, come help me. Stop! Have you gone mad? What happened? He was hit in the arm. Don't worry. It's just a flesh wound, superficial. Careful, Clint! Stay here. I'll catch up and recover the diamonds. Try over here. He'll never be found. He's not too far. The day will break soon, then we'll find him. They're gone. They won't come back. We have the boat, let's go. No, Nancy. We can't abandon Clint. I don't want to die, Dawson! We can't abandon them! Quick, Dawson! Come on! You're cowards. You're all cowards! Look! Moreau's prints. We're on the right track. Stop! Don't move or I'll shoot. You can't escape. Leave the diamonds and go. Help! I don't want to die! Don't move, Samoa. It's quicksand, we can't do anything. What didn't we do for those diamonds? Blood, death, massacre... And all for nothing. There. Come on. The boat's disappeared. There are no signs of a struggle. They must have fled. They can't leave the jungle. Look, there! A canoe left by the natives. Samoa, we're saved! Courage, we'll get there. What's this? They look like diamonds. Look, there's others. I'm so forgetful. I forgot I put some in my pocket.
