We brought some wine. We got a sitter. I could kill her. She... well, I love her, but she's late. - Well, you love her. - I think she's amazing. Well, she's a stoned but she does... ah, you got a... You're having a little bit of a... You're leaking there a little bit. Oh, wow. Oh, jeez. Do you want me to run down to the car and get the pump or something? Maybe now is a good time to maybe... - Oh, my God. - We got this pump. First of all, this contraption is like... Can you not talk about it? I'm so embarrassed right now. - It's no big deal. - Do you need to... I'm so sorry. Okay, let us take care of this, and we'll be right back. Okay, go help her. Go. You go. - Okay, we're gonna... - Thank you. Hold on. He knows what a pump is. It's not like he doesn't. all: Cheers! Some water for the mommy. Cheers to that. Thank you for having us. Thank you for being here. How exciting. Everybody's up for a little kid break tonight, teachers too. Oh, my God. Yes, I did, I did. It's so nice to be here. Everyone had a great day? Mm-hmm. Yes. Henry was very sweet. He took me to the beach. We're pretty classy here in the Hughes house. Baby pictures! Well, she's really cute so... I brought baby pictures. Baby Mathilda. Oh, look at that. Look at her little baby toes. I know. Oh, my gosh. Are you kidding? Yeah, she's really... Oh, is that your sister? Yes. Aw. It's so sweet that she got to visit. I know. I know. Oh. Wow, right away, just after? Oh! Um. Can I... I'm so sorry. Oh, no. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be so embarrassed. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God. Okay, no, they got worse. They got worse, so, yeah. Really? Oh, come on. I grabbed a... I grabbed a stack of photos. There's a couple... Vagina. Look at these photos. They go together, babies and... I'm so sorry. My vagina... Oh, we're all friends. Who cares? I'm sorry. What's wrong? Let's all eat dinner. Oh, my God. Okay, pass the good ones. It's a vagina, people. Dax, you have to look. Oh, my goodness. She's so beautiful. Kind of makes you want one. Can you put them in your pocket? So it's really changed your life, I bet. Oh, yeah. Anyways... Yes. To new babies. all: Hear. Here it is. Cheers. Here's to babysitters. Who made the pie? You made the pie? Oh, wow. Oh. I'll get it. You guys go ahead and start. - Hi. - Hey. How are you? I'm great. Is Dax around? - Hey. - Hi. Ah, that's Sylvia. Hi. Hey, it's Jackson. Hey. Do you want to go serve the pie, and I'll, um... Yeah, sure. Are you sure you guys don't want to come inside? Good. Positive. Okay. Come back another time, then. - Thank you. - Okay. Where you been? You guys having a little party here? Yeah. We're having some people over. - Awesome. - You okay? Actually, I'm great. I'm getting married. - You're getting married? - Yeah. Hey, baby, come meet my brother. Eh... - Is she okay? - Yeah, she's fine. We were just running all over today. She's exhausted. I didn't even know you were seeing anybody. Oh, we just met, but God damn it, I'm in love with her. I figured, what the hell? Join the married folks like you guys. And shit, she's gonna be your sister-in-law, so you should meet her. When are you getting married? That's the funny thing. We're driving to Las Vegas tonight. Tonight? Yeah. You're gonna get married tonight? I don't know, man. I'm in love with her. I can't help it. Wow. Uh, congratulations. To you both. Thanks a lot. The thing is, we're a little shy on gas money. Oh, well, here. I... I'll... I'll pay you back... sometime. All I've got is, like, $100. That's... $100's amazing. Thanks. You're a stand-up guy. What'd I tell you, babe? Stand-up guy right here. Have a good dinner party. Yeah. All right. Jackson! Congratulations. I think you killed me. You know what I'd like? I don't think I can for just a second. Not that. I want to have your baby. Okay, you got me. I want you to make me pregnant. Stop laughing. I'm serious. I want to... I want to start a family. We already talked about this. On our first date, you said you didn't want to have kids. No. No. You said you didn't want to have kids, and you also said that the Catholic Church should canonize Kurt Cobain. I did not say that. You definitely said that. I think we were on mushrooms. No, that was our second date. On our first date, we went and had Italian food, and we both agreed that it was selfish and narcissistic to bring kids into this world. Dax? What about that time when we drove your dad cross-country, in the motel room? I was talking about how hard it was gonna be to start taking care of my father. And I... That was three years ago. Yeah, but I mean, it's not like the world got to be a better place. You know, just today on NPR, I heard this thing about these kids in Darfur. Rebel armies march into their villages and kill all the adults. And then they give the kids a choice: either eat the dead bodies or be killed too. What are you talking about? Cannibalism. Those kids have to eat their parents. I just don't understand bringing a child into that kind of world. We don't live in Darfur. That's... that's not my point. But I mean, you love kids. You're a teacher. You love them. They're my class. Of course I love them. And they love you. Just think about it. You'd be a great dad. I don't know that. You know? I mean, you don't know that. I just... Those kids are not easy, Olive. I'm sure some of their parents wish that they had taken better advantage of contraception. That is a terrible thing to say. I'm serious. You know? The kind of life we have is over for them. It's just... I'm mean, most of them are just struggling to stay together. Besides, you have good genes, but look at my family. What if I got pregnant? But you're not. No. But what if? I just feel like we already talked about this. We can talk about it some more, right? I have to go to the bathroom. Thanks. You gonna go see your dad today? You want me to go with you? It's too confusing for him right now. Okay. This is my dad's bonobo chimpanzee mask. Bonobos' DNA is 98% identical to humans. My dad also has a complete set of Congo River animal action figures. This is my mom's Jane Goodall research costume. When my dad moved across town with Vicky Green... Let's wrap it up, Sammy. My mom buried them both in the backyard. You can see the chip on the top of the mask where my shovel hit it. Okay. Let's sit down. And it took me three weeks to find where she hid them. Okay, who else has something to share? all: Me! All right, Meegan. Hey, Sammy, can I talk to you for a second? Listen, you know, some things are private. Can you take the mask off for me? Do you know what I'm talking about? It's not always good to talk about everything. My mom says it's good to talk. Okay, yeah. You know, I just don't think she means, like, at show-and-tell. Can I hold on to the bathing suit? All right, go have fun. What... what do you call these again, Olivia? Snaps, Dad. They're your favorites, gingersnaps. Right. Well, they're delicious. No, no. You finish them. They're for you. That's okay, June. You give those to the baby. She likes cookies too. Dad, I'm Olivia. And June was your wife. I know. I know who you are. That's right, Dad. You know me. Hi. It's like we have a second pet. Hi. Mmmm. I guess you had a good day. It was terrible. Lucky me. Oh, wait. Hey. - What? - I'll meet you in the bedroom. Hey, hey. Hey, wake up. Stop! Stop! Jackson! I thought you were a cop, man. What the hell are you doing here? We were sleeping. Get out of the car. Hey, I'm sorry about this morning. You know, Jackson, it wasn't just us. You woke up the whole neighborhood. Ah, well, we were gonna come in last night, man, but your lights were off. Okay, so we had to sleep in the car. You know the point is, you just shouldn't be driving like that. - I know that. - Obviously, you don't. I'm sorry. I'm gonna be late. Looks great. Thank you. Can you try to eat something, babe? Please. It's good. Looks good. You guys have a paper towel? Okay. We've had to keep him in his room all day. Well, you can't keep him here as a prisoner. Dad, just sit down and behave for a second. I thought you said routine was important. It is important. But his behavior is escalating as time goes on. Livy! Just hold on, Dad! I'm having a conversation! It's okay, Bruce. Safety is our most important concern. Well, he can be in the garden if I'm with him, right? Of course, he can. I'm not a child. You shouldn't talk about me like I'm not here. I'm sorry, Dad. Do you want to go to the garden? Okay. Let's go. We're fine. I didn't mean to. I know you didn't, Daddy. Hi, Bruce. - Hey, babe. I'm sorry... - Hey. - Olive. - Is everything okay? Can you just take him to the garden for me for a second? Sure. Dax. Come on, Pops. Let's go take a walk. He didn't mean to. We have to talk about options. Your father either needs or we're gonna have to sedate him. I'll think about it. We're not equipped for violent residents. He's not violent. Punching is violent. If it happens again, we're gonna have to ask you to find someplace else. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry he hit you. It's the disease. I just need a little bit of time. Then he's like, "Mr. Dax is the best. "Mr. Dax, he grades my test. Mr. Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?" That's what it sounded like. Hey, play something on vinyl. All right. Hey, what do you want to drink? Mmm, red wine. No wine. What? No. No beer. What? We do have this. Oh. Okay, Mr. Award-Winning Educator, your secret's safe with me. You're so beautiful. No, no. You first. No, me first. Me first. You can't get it? I can get it. I'll get it. No, stay. I know where matches are. I know where matches are. I'll get it. I know where matches are. I'll be back. Found some. I got it. Wow. I'm gonna make the best breakfast in the world. Eggs, toast, bacon, orange juice. I'm gonna make smoothies. I make the best smoothies in the world. - And potatoes. - And potatoes. They're made from old sweaters. What is it? A bear. It's a bear. And all the of money that we make from selling them will go to the Sparrow Rock Elementary School. Oh. Little kids made them. No. Actually, I make them. Oh. Very nice. Hey, baby. Hey. Chocolate. Thank you. It's a little melty. Ice cream always makes me think of Disneyland. I didn't know you went to Disneyland. Yeah. My mom took us, kind of. How do you kind of take someone to Disneyland? One summer... I must have been about seven... Jackson started collecting these coupons for half off tickets to Disneyland. Mm-hmm. And my mom got really into it with him and collected all summer. And then when they had enough, she talked Frank into driving us all down. So all five kids... Frank's three girls, me, and Jackson... loaded into the back of Frank's Caddy. Mm-hmm. And we drove for hours, no AC, totally hot and sweaty. You know? But no fights. We were all excited and on our best behavior. Uh-huh. And then when we got there... Half of the tickets had expired. Frank got really pissed off. He started a shoving match with the guy at the gate. We all had to load back up into the car. I can still remember the way Disneyland looked getting small through the back of the windshield. That's, like, the saddest thing I've ever heard. Everybody was crying, and Frank was yelling at us to shut up, and my mom was a total mess. But then, you know, she told Frank to pull over. She grabbed 40 bucks from her purse. She marched us into Baskin-Robbins. Any kid could have as much ice cream as they wanted. Jackson got a banana split the size of his head. I always just liked chocolate. I love this. Hmm? I said, I love this. Me too. Oh! Ah, fuck. Hey, buddy. What the hell? You're late. I'm sorry, man. They were talking to me and asking me questions. I think I got this job. Well, that's great, Jackson, but you promised that you wouldn't be late, and now I'm late. Okay, well, get the car, go to work. I got trash. Go, go, go. Uh, are you guys having a kid? No, that's... that's not... I mean, we're not. It's, um... Yeah. We're not. Didn't she tell you about it? No. I mean, I knew about this. It's just... it's nothing. All right. Well, I won't say anything to her. But, um, actually, man, I kind of wanted to talk to you about... She's not pregnant. Okay. You know, there was just a slipup with the birth control. She's fine. Yup. Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight! Hey! Hey! Hey! That's enough. Your mom's stupid. I said that's enough! Come on. Kids, sit down. Well, it's our first time trying Thai, so I hope the flavors are all right. - It's delicious. - It is. Really, really good. Thank you. Really good. Thanks. This wine is excellent. Oh, good. I'm glad. You don't want any? Mm, no, I'm still nursing, so I can't. Can't do it. Because everything I have will go right to Mathilda, so... Oh. Wow, no alcohol for... what is that, a year? That's a long time. You're such a boozehound. No, I'm just saying, it takes patience, you know? He just likes the wine. Here, let me top you off. You are a little bit of a boozehound. Thank you. All right, well, give me some more. It is a long time, though, 'cause you know, you're pregnant for 9 months and then nursing for 12. It's... Forever, forever, it feels like. I really miss coffee more than anything. Olive loves her coffee. That's true. I do love coffee. I also love wine, so maybe I should have a little more. Excuse me. I think he's an awesome dog. He is an awesome dog. He's just neurotic. Yeah, well, all dogs are afraid of fireworks, right? I mean, that's not too neurotic. Maybe not. But last year on the Fourth, he was so freaked out, he peed all over the house. Oh. He was like a big furry faucet. Not this year. We're ready for him. We're gonna slip him a mickey. What? We're going to sedate him. Henry got some pills from the vet, and we're going to knock the little pisser out. That's probably a really good idea. Just let him sleep through the whole thing and not worry about it. Exactly. I think it's immoral. What? Drugging a dog just because it's convenient for you. It's medical. I mean, it's for his own good. Dax. Did you know that Olive used to drug our cat? What? She used to blow pot smoke in its face until it got high. I did that once. I just don't think that you should be inflicting your will on animals that don't get to participate in the decision. Wow. Our dog, he gets into some pot brownies. This was years ago, but I still feel a little bit terrible about it. We had a... like an entire plateful of pot brownies. The dog devours the whole thing, and, like, you know, you know, more than is safe. I love you. Love you too. I'm sorry I gave marijuana to the cat. Dad. Dax and I are thinking about having a baby, I mean, soon. Would you like that? Would you like a grandchild? That's good. That's good that you're gonna have a baby. See you next time. Okay. May I help you? I'm here to pick up my wife's prescription. Her name? Olive Hughes. Okay, give me a moment. Mr. Hughes, your wife hasn't filled that prescription here for some time now. Ah, yeah, we've been out of town. I'll still have to call her physician. For birth control? It is a prescription, Mr. Hughes. Right. Okay. Of course. Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello? Hey, babe. Oh, hi. God, you scared me. Hey, what are you doing home so early? Oh, the kids had one of those motivational assemblies, and so I got the rest of the day off. Hmm, lucky us. Want to help me wash my hair? No. Not... not right now. Are you sure? Yeah, I... I just don't want to get wet. You know, there was a sub today at school who got pregnant, and she was using the diaphragm. I just wanted to make sure that we weren't, you know, too hasty or anything in switching it up and that, you know, it was safe. Yeah, yeah, it's totally s... it's, like... you know, it's as safe as anything else, like, you know, 97% or, like, 98.8% or whatever. You know, I feel so much better. And I think it's also supposed to help reduce the risk of some cancers. I just wanted to make sure that you were covered, you know, and that you're doing okay. Dax? Yeah? I mean, does it bother you or something? Can you feel it? No. No, it's fine. Someone's at the front door. I'm gonna grab that. Hey. It's all fucked up, man. What? Sylvia. Hey, do you want to come inside? I'm sorry. Fuck, I just feel like I'm dying, man. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't fucking do anything. I just sit and think about her all day. What happened? I wasn't enough for her, so... I mean, I tried. And I lost that job. But it's just so much more than that. I'm a fucking... I'm a fucking weak son of a bitch. Yeah. What? I'm sorry. Maybe you guys can still talk it out. She left a note. She's not coming back. Hey. Let's go inside. I'll make some coffee. No, man. I just wanted to talk to somebody. I'm good. Jackson, come inside. I'm late for something, so... What? What are you late for? Do you know how much it costs to get to Wilshire? I got to get some lunch too. Here. Thanks, man. You're a good guy. Olive is very lucky. Yeah. Hey, Jackson, do you ever... do you ever think you're in over your head? What? I don't know. You know, we've got fucked-up genetics. Our mother was a whore. That has nothing to do with genetics. All I'm saying is that, you know, I know you drink. I don't know what else you do, but if you wanted, I could help you with that. I'm, uh... You know, I could... I'm not in over my head. Thanks for the loan. I'll get you back. How did you sleep? Good. Did you dream? Hey. Hey. What are you doing up there? Oh, nothing. How did you sleep? Hmm. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just... I think I'm worried about Jackson. Mm. Thanks, babe. Sure. That was awesome. Yeah. Hmm. Is something wrong? It's a little bitter or something. Huh. I'll run water through the coffeemaker later. Have a good day. You too. Hey. Hey, can I... I got to pick up that prescription. I know. I know. Please, man. Thanks. Thanks so much. Okay. Dad. Dad? You have to be careful. I have scissors. Good morning, Bruce. Time for your meds. How are we today, Bruce? How are we? - How are we? - How are we? We are drugged out of any sort of personality. We are in a semiconscious haze with no ability to communicate. And he doesn't even know who I am. Okay. Listen, Olive. Just... just let go of the scissors. Take a time-out in the bathroom. You're frightening your father. You're frightening your father. Bruce, can you open your mouth for me? Can you just open your mouth? No? Can you do that? No? No. Okay. That's okay. You all right? I'm all right. Hey. Hey. It's okay. I'm okay. Yeah. Here you go. That's it. What's funny? Anna's so sweet, but she can't spell to save her life. Her essay is all about her new soccer couch. "The couch tells me I can go far if I just try. "However, my couch studied in Brazil, so I will need to go there if I want to be better." She's really cute. Sounds funny. I guess you just have to know her. Dax! What? You're tapping. I didn't realize. I'll stop. Thanks. I don't even know why I make these. Nobody ever buys them. # Love # # Oh, love # # Careless love # # Oh, love # # Oh, love # # Careless love # # Love # # Oh, love # # Careless love # # See what you've done? # Jesus. # Done to me # # I used to wear my apron # # Down low # # Follow me # # Wherever I go # # Oh, oh, oh # # But now I wear my apron # # High... # # Ah, ooh # # Ooh, ooh # # Careless love # # I said ooh # # Ooh, ooh, ooh # # Ah, ah, ah, ah # # Ah, ah, ah... # # Careless love # Hi. Okay, Mrs. Hughes. Well, the home tests were correct. You're not pregnant. I'm not pregnant? No. But I'm moody, and I'm swollen, and I cry a lot. Oh, you'll probably just start your period soon. Oh. You were hoping for a pregnancy? Yeah, I guess so. Are you trying for a baby? Yes. That's great. You're healthy. We confirmed a pill prescription for you a few months back. It's possible to get pregnant right away, but for most people, it takes some trying. If things don't happen naturally, come back, and we'll talk. My pill prescription? Your birth control pill. No, I'm not taking the birth control pills. Right. But you renewed your prescription four months ago. So you haven't been off it very long. No. I renewed? When did you take your pill last? I'm sorry. Um... I don't know when I took my last pill. Yeah, it's still in your body. Just give it a while. Keep trying. You can get dressed now. Hey, just the person I wanted to see. Not now. Hey, Olive. I could really use some advice about something. Hi. What's going on? What happened? I went to the gynecologist today, Dax. You okay? No. Apparently, I messed up my birth control pills, and that's... that's not very good for me, you know? It's not too fucking healthy. I... I've been slipping them to you. Is that what you're trying to say? Because I found your little pill stash. How could you do that to me? Do you know how stupid I felt sitting in that office thinking I was pregnant? I found your diaphragm. You started it. Well, I'm sorry, but that's not the same thing. It's not the same thing? You can't sneak a baby, Olive. It's a human being, for Christ sake. You wouldn't even talk to me about it. You wouldn't even discuss it with me. I told you. I told you I did not want to have a kid. I mean, look at my family. Is that what you want? I don't think you know. You know, I think it's some sort of conceptual thing for you, Olive. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I forgot that you know what's best for everyone. If we had a kid, everything we did, every mistake we made would affect that kid. I mean, we'd mess it up. You what? Did you... You put it in my coffee every day? Every day for how many months? Don't look at me like that. No. You don't get to look at me like that with everything that I have going on right now with my dad. Exactly. It's just, your dad's falling apart. And you're trying to trick me into having a baby. No, you don't get to talk to me about him. You don't get to talk to me about my dad. How could you do this to me? I'm not going to stand here and compare scores with you on who's worse, because you drugged me, Dax. I was... Ah... Dax? Are you okay? Dax? I don't feel... - Okay. - I don't feel good. Okay. Just stay right there. Vitamin B and vitamin C and Tylenol cold and sinus, some codeine that was left over from a root canal. Okay. I think there were some children vitamins. Laxatives. And birth control pills, just two of them. And that's all. And some echinacea. And that's all. Okay. I didn't make it for you, you know? I just wanted to see how easy it was to hide pills. Okay, Mr. Hughes. These will help settle your stomach. You probably won't feel like eating tomorrow, and that's okay. Remember to stay hydrated, even if you're sipping water or chewing ice slivers. This has the contact number should you have any more problems. Keep an eye on him. What do you want? You want to split? Do you want a divorce? I don't know. Do you? I don't know. I don't think so. I don't know. I'm pissed, Olive. Yeah. You can reach me on my cell. Olive! I thought I had the wrong place. I'm sorry it's so late. What's going on? Olive left me. I just wanted to talk. Yeah. That's shitty, man. Can I come in? No. I can't come in? Well, Sylvia's sick. She's really sick. And I think... I think it's contagious. She's back? Yeah. It's just a bad time. I'll... I could stop by later. We could get a beer or something. I'm sorry about Olive. Olive. Mrs. Hughes. We've been trying to reach you. Your dad had a stroke last night. He died early this morning. He was very peaceful. He wasn't alone. No. I was with him. Nobody called me. Yes, we've been calling. Oh, God. Olive. Olive? Dax? Olive? Dax. My dad died. Oh, Jesus. I'll never be able to go back there. I ran away. I'll never be able to go back there. Yes, you can. I'll go with you. Yeah? Yeah. Let's have a baby. What are you talking about? Not because of what happened with your dad. I was thinking about it before you even came back. I'm scared, but that's a bad reason not to do something, you know? The way we love each other, you know, it'd be okay. Dax. We can't have a baby. We're a total fucking mess. But I love you. You want one, and I want one. I love you so much. But no. We're the last people in the world who should be having a kid. But I want one. No. # Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh # # Ooh, ooh # # Ooh, ooh # # Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh # # Ooh, ooh # # Ooh, ooh # # Ooh, ooh, ooh # # Ooh, ooh # # Ooh, ooh, ooh # Olive? Hey, baby, your coffee's ready. Olive? Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm about to iron. Do you want me to iron your shirt? No, no. I just won't take my jacket off. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Okay. Are you okay? Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna grab that real quick, all right? Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Jackson. Hey, little brother. Wow. You... you look sharp. Yeah. Olive's dad died. We're going to the funeral. Who's that? Oh. Yeah, he's a small one. Look, all his little fingers barely add up to one of mine. He's kind of good-looking, though, don't you think? When? I think he's about a month. Where's Sylvia? Oh, man. That's been kind of a nightmare. She shows up a week ago. She dumps him on me. And then she sneaks out in the night. Oh, man. Come on, you should come inside. The thing is, I'm doing my best, and I've been clean for two whole days, and I'm gonna stay that way. But the kid, he can't stay at my place. Shit, I can't even stay at my place. Jackson, what are you talking about? Dax, I'm going upstate. There's a rehab up there, okay? I've been talking to one of the counselors, and I'm gonna turn my shit around. Now, listen, Mary's been up there, okay? She says it's a great place. And you said you'd help me, Dax. I need you to take my baby. What about Sylvia? Okay, so there's diapers in this bag, okay? There's... there's a bottle. There's formula. Jackson. Jackson. You can't just dump this on me. Dax, I can't. I can't. But I will call you, and I will be back. Wait. Jackson. I'll be back. How do I... Okay. I'm ready. Who's that? It's Jackson's son. Jackson has a baby? Yeah. Well, where's Jackson? He left. When is he coming back? I don't know.
