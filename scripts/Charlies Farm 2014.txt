We should just stay here. I'm not going anywhere. I hold your hand all the time. Don't go. I have to. We need to defend ourselves. We have to leave. Let me do this. I'll check. - Please, stay here. I think I found a way out. - Are you sure? Translation: Sheeba & Lain Editing : Chris91 Let's go. Get away from it all. Sounds good. But I'm not going anywhere with just you two. Can I ask Melanie? I know they don't have to work. Where are you taking us this time? Let's go to the beach. We have already done that Let's go inland everytime.. We can go horseback riding. - Sounds nice. Melanie will like it. Let's do something else sometimes. - Okay, good. Natasha, ask Melanie if she goes along. I'm not sleeping with him in the same tent. Come on. Your mother loved it too. Okay lovebirds. I will ask Mel. Watching you, but where will we go. I know where we can go. - Where? You always want to go to a haunted house. - Yes, why? Near Mitchell is a place called Charlie's farm. It is said that the family who lived there in the 80, was killed by the villagers. Tell. That farm is far away from civilization. We pack our camping gear and go take a look. You want to camp at Charlie's farm? - Yes, it will be fun. I'm in. Not a word to the ladies. We will tell when we get there. - Good. Where are we going? - We go to the west. Riding and fishing. - Did you hear that? Since you have a large estate. - A farm. You are now in Australia. It's all one pot wet. Will she last? - Yes, she goes along. Nice. When do we leave? - We leave at 06:00. Come tomorrow at 6am here, we leave together. - That sounds good, mate. We have plenty of time for the eight hour long ride. Yes, come to my house. - Take warm clothes. Do not forget to bring warm clothes, because it is very cold. I love her warm. - Yes, you did. Or in your own tent. - That's the purpose. I'm going to get my camping gear. See you at 6 o'clock. - Later. Hi guys. Give that to me. - Thank you. Mick, I have to ask you this. Why do they call you 'Donkey'? Are you serious? Honey, she believes that? - What is it? Why do they call him 'Donkey'? He can stop him almost in his mouth. - If I could, I did. You're kooky. - That's sick. Hurry up and give me a hand. Why don't we sleep together? - What are you a slut. I mean in the tent I sleep. - The Mick. Nice. I have another question. Why go west? You have a gift... place there - where you can horseback riding, fishing and camping. There is no mobile coverage, no Facebook. Only healthy air to breathe. What do you mean no Facebook? I have fans. - I know. I am also one. Your fans can be fixed wait a few days. What are you doing? You would not say anything? - I wish them pinning a nice story. So I cut down on you just as well. Think first. Well, let's go. Hey Jason, how long before we get there? No idea. Two hours? - You said it took eight hours? We are often stopped on the way. Let's stop somewhere to set up camp. Tomorrow we can drive to Mitchell. Are you agree with that? - I do not care where we go camping. I'm starving. I also. Let's stretch our legs and then I drive though. Sounds good. Let's find a camping spot. Are you sure it's left? It is left. To the left! - Are you sure? What was on the board then? - This way. We're heading Tulaca. We drive for hours. I am starving. - If you're wrong, there'll be hell. I'm not wrong. You all right? How are you? Hey sweetheart. Everything good? Have you ever heard of Charlie's farm? He talks to everybody. - He is not called Donkey. Have you ever heard Charlie's farm? Who does that? - That's pretty weird. Thank you brought for us beer. - Sorry I did not bring beer. You can not do well against alcohol? - It's just a beer. Blue is it? - Indeed. Can I ask you something? - Just ask. How long have you lived here? - Born and raised. He knows the area here like no other. Afraid of the big city, huh? - Just go away, you idiot. I was once there. There are too many people to me. You know Charlie's farm? Do you think the food? You are not planning to go there? Totally. What do you know about that place? - Nothing! Stay out of there, boy. You can better your car steps and go back home again. What is Charlie's farm? - You do not know. The best thing you can do is go home. Jason, what is Charlie's farm? - I have no idea. There still get a lot of people missing? - More than you think. For years. That's just a bullshit story. Who wants another beer? Not for them. You're going to take you home friends, right? - I want to have a beer. No, you've had enough already. Come on. Girls, we go. Now get out. Stupid idiots. - Be calm. Come on. - We are sorry. What was that about? - Say what's going on? You called a farm and everyone did a sudden weird. I do not understand. - Me neither. What is Charlie's farm, and why do you go there? Let's find a place to sleep, and then talk about it. Let's go before Blue shoot me. That old curmudgeon. It's not cranky. He was there. He knows more about it than he would like. Surely there are nicer places to go than Charlie's farm? He was there when everything happened? - Yes, you listening? This is intense. - Who is that? What are you talking about? I talked to your boyfriend. He wants you for a bad, dark place. 'A bad, dark place. " Good. Do not listen to him. Let's go. I warn you already. Do not go there. It's a bad place. Is that right, man? Yet Just go back inside and take a beer. Why do not you and Blue what kangaroos shoot? Mick, do well on. Fagot Why do not you just give up? Let's get in the car. - You're a real smart ass, huh? When you arrive at Mitchell, then turn left. Go to St. George. There you'll find Charlie's farm. Let him loose. Get in the car. Everything is okay. Bye. Just play a victory song. You have to keep your mouth shut. Please, just go. Do not forget. St. George. I want the truth. What was going on there? There's near a place called Charlie's farm. It seemed a good idea for a few nights camping there. Sounds good, right? You should have seen their faces. When you about Charlie's farm began saw them look really weird. They looked not at all strange. - They were not laughing. Go ahead. Tell it to them. Yeah, tell me about it. I'll tell you what I heard when I was little. Mid 80s there lived a family here. Their names were John and Meredith Wilson. It was rumored, John was an American. Just like you. I only know that they had a son named Charlie . That John was a kooky figure. He killed tourists who were working on his land. He ate parts of their on. Please? Help me please? Please? Please? Keep your mouth shut! Kill her anyway. Please? We try to entertain here. Where are my friends? There you have me tuk. I want to see them. Please let us go. All your friends are dead. It was not my fault. - How do you mean? If you hold your mouth, I'll tell you. Your friend Trevor. I hope he was your boyfriend. What he was a sissy. He screamed like a girl. Then he began to call his mother. When Meredith was angry. You have no idea how crazy my wife is when she's angry. She is truly psychotic. Meredith is now very angry at you. Why? How would you feel if your husband 'm tempted... ... By a young delletje the past four days. We both know what you feel about me. Nothing against Meredith say, but I think there's something between us. If she finds out you're mad at me, then she'll murder you. You lie here naked and begging me for sex. That's not fair opposite Meredith. What are you talking about? You raped me! Wait a minute. Raped? Take you kidding me? You lie there moaning and panting. I've never had such noisy. You are all crazy. You're not so tight, but you're the best I've had. Most ladies crying and tense, but not you. You lay back and spread your legs. And said to me, 'Give it to me, John. " Charlie. Give the leftovers to the pigs. Charlie. Charlie, you've heard your mother! Mongolian. Come on. Stand up. Go out and do what your mother says. An advice. No children please. Did you see that? We give that child... ... A roof over his head and three meals a day. Then you would have thought that he would do some chores. What are you going to do to me? I thought we were talking about small Charlie. You are so selfish. - What are you gonna do to me? Well, take it easy. We must talk about dinner. Dinner? Do me go? Meredith state do all day... ... showing off... ... to make the favorite food of those backward. Backpack Tourist spareribs. You kraamt nonsense. That spareribs I invented. This was not even the best part. It's just a campfire story. He wants to scare us. It's true. Why do you think that old man got so angry when he brought it. Go. I want to hear the rest. A few hours after the murder of the tourist John heard shouting in his front yard. Boy. Go feed the pigs. What does he eat those pigs give you? Who is that? - Can be police. Who could it be? - How do I know? Take that moron. In case of problems you let him go. Look at that. Is the pub closed or something? We want you to stop what you're doing here. Blue, take bargasten back to town. We know you killed people here. We are just farmers. We're just trying to earn a living. Go now my property. I will not say it again. I think you yourself should indicate to the police. Like what? The murder of innocent people. Where are all those workers who were here to work? They were mad, so I I shot them. Who told you this nonsense? I heard them on would eat, sick mind. Are we now cannibals? Where are they, John? They are all gone. How are these hippies. I do not know what they do when they leave? And it interests me nothing. Stop the lies. - Where is that stupid son of yours? Do not say that. Do not make her angry. Then I get to endure it again. If you talk one more time so about my son... ... Then I'll chop your head off and I feed him to the dingoes. Is that so? That may be an issue with us as well. What problem? I have no problem. You're dead and you're dead. You're all going to. You do not know who to make you have. Charlie, let it loose bucket. Come quickly! Come on, hurry up. That's what I heard. Apparently they have all the bodies buried there. Some people believe that they have fed the bodies to the 'razor backs. This one guy said that Blue was there then. He must know what happened to the mother and child. I do not understand. Why did not they just call the police? I do not know? There they will probably have had their reasons. The bodies they found in the house disappeared . If it is an urban myth. Just hear back. What is a "razorback"? That's a pig. An adult male pig is called a boar. And if he's really big then you call it a Razorback. Charlie has since never seen again? No, just disappeared. That's quite a story, right? They say he was killed by the local population or anywhere died. Some believe he is still alive somewhere. Would anyone have not seen him ? Do not be. It's a big area here. There are so many caves to shelter... ... that you can survive years without being seen. Why are you up to such a place? I want to explore the ordinary. See if we can find the house. Just look around. We might find there really cool things. What do you have to go find it. This is so stupid. I do not know. It's an adventure. We are not the only ones who do this. There are so many people who have heard the stories and look. No, just you two idiots. I mean it. I think it can be fun. And if we do not like it, then we pack our stuff and leave. Yes, if we do not like it we go. I'm firmly to bed. I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. - Goodnight Jason. If you like it, then we go home. I have a bad feeling about it. A feeling inside. If you want to go we'll go, but I have a bad feeling about it. I love you, Donkey. Wake. Hands above the covers. Stop. I was shocked. We have to find a farm. Get up! That's nasty. What is it? You now have pooped in your pants or you're rotten inside, because it stinks tremendously. After what you've just done do I shit indeed. Almost pooped my pants. That's nasty. - Too much information guys. We really go to Charlie's farm? - Indeed. And the word fantastic. And all those stories that told yesterday Mick. Are they true? - From what I've heard. What if Charlie is still alive? Would not that bad. It seems stiff that he after 30 years suddenly turns up again. And if we take it to him. But the man in the bar was about all those missing people. He was fixed on those murders tourists in South Australia. We need not worry. Let's pack our bags and go because I want to find that place today. We go once I went to the toilet. He really rancid. - I guess I'm no longer interested. Where are we? - We go to St. George. What is St. George? The guy said we had to go to St. George . What did he say then? That's all he said. Call Tony. This is nonsense. He knows where to go. Tony? - Hi, Natasha. Who calls them? - Tony Stewart. Good joke. No, I mean it. Tony Stewart. Who is that? - Tony 'The Hitman' Stewart. He is a boxing champion. That's him, yes. That's no fun. How do you know him? Do you know him? He says it is very dangerous and that we should not go there. How do we get there? He wants to know the way. He does not say to go. - Give me that phone. You're such a jerk. - Tony, are you there? With Jason. Yes, sorry. The range is bad here. Are you still there? Wait. I'm going to quit. Are you still there? Charlie's farm, huh? Someone feels brave. I've never been there, but it has a bad reputation. I've heard, yes. You have talked to the people there? - Yeah, what can you tell me about it? I know it is a vast area. More than 400,000 acres of land. So the farm will likely cede far from the road. There are a recently some backpackers went missing. That's great. Do not get too excited. Always when people go missing, they give Charlie's farm debt. The police are there not even look anymore. How long will you stay there? A few days and then we go back. After yourself when you're there... ... and call me when you're weather in Mitchell. Comes well. Where should we go? Who is most popular at the police station? One who can carry two coffee and twelve donuts. I do not understand him. - Me neither. They also do not understand him. Good. Thank you. Thank you. - You're still a jerk. What did he say? He said: "Be careful, be kind to your mother and this way." I have to pee. It must be here. - Tasty though. What a great castle. Yeah, huh. I said finally, Donkey! Finally. Check this out. - What is that? Look at that. This is the. Here is truly Wilson. That was their name. This is proof that what I said is real. That's it. - Wonderful. Help me with the fence. I try this side. That's fine. The gate is locked, so we can not get through. We do seek to another input. This is the entrance. Here they lived. We're going to walk. We're going to walk, and leave the car here. He just say walk? - We're not going to walk. By car, chances are that you too far home runs and fog. This is their path. Here we go along. Also for safety reasons. I agree with you. How much walking I think also, he's right. If we follow this path we find at least the way back. How far is the walk? Maybe a kilometer or so. Not so far from the road. What do you think? Take what we need and let's go. Okay, grab your stuff. We're really doing this so? We're really running? Yes, it will do you good. What do you mean? Are you saying I'm fat? Yes, that's exactly what he says. I did not say. The exercise will do you good. You're an asshole. It will do us all good. No, you're a jerk. A fool. Horrible to walk through it. You have at least some pants. You also have some pants. Yet though. What are you a pervert. How far is it? - Not far more. We're just walking. - I really needed. Yet 800 meters. - As long as I do not completely full. You'll be fine. - I really need. Stop just a cork in. Wait until there is more grass. We walk for hours. Are you sure this is the way? I do not know. Let still walk a little further. Maybe we'll find a campsite. She's right. We walk for hours. What time is it? - It's half past five. Let's camp here. - No, come on. It must be here somewhere. Look at that. Very nice. Maybe the villagers have burned. Maybe it no longer exists. It's not there. Then they nevertheless also could get which fence off. Indeed. Give me your bags. That would be bale. Why? If it were burned. I can tell you that it is not burned. Why? Because I look at it. Unbelievable. There it is. - Here we go overnight. Are you serious? - I mean it. Come on. Good to hot to sleep tonight. - You will not get cold. Well? What? She wants to know who goes first go inside? Jason of course. He is the horror fanatic. Let's go all at once. Come on. So much is not. This is nonsense. Come on. Look at this. Awesome huh? Awesome? Rather scary. Look all that stuff. Here I just make use of. Noah and Becky. That's romantic. 'I survived Charlie's farm. What would have happened? What is that? What is that? Snakeskin. What happened? Acorn. - Everything is good! Let me once. If you can it? What is that? Look. Cute right? Maybe he was Charlie? - Sure was Charlie, Einstein. What are you doing? I want this love. That's a bad idea. - Why? If they want to keep him, let her. That might be a collector's item. There'll be down a lot stuff here we can sell. That's a good idea. There are enough here things that people want it. No. You can keep that bear, but the rest will remain here. No worries. I'll talk to her. That was the wind. Do you have to look. If we stay here, we stay together. Why now? I agree. 'I survived Charlie's farm. Hard to believe we're in the house where the murders took place. The father was shot outside. Who knows how many people have been murdered here. Look everywhere, boys. What is that stench? There are a lot evil men who want to hurt us. Whatever happens, do not come out. Do you understand? Come on. Come on bunch of bastards. You killed my John. I'll kill all of you and I carry you all in my pigs. Is there anyone alive? I tell you nothing. Tell me where they are. Fuck. Where are they? - Get lost. Where is this moron? Tell that right in my face... ... you coward! Where is this moron? Charlie is deceased a year ago. Where is he? I just said. He is a year dead. Let her murder, then we're done with it. I believe anything she says. He's here. Do you hear me? That moron survive not last long here. Make it end. The farmers continued to strike Meredith. Charlie saw everything happen. Without even let one tear. They have beaten her death. She cried, screamed and laughed. Now I can not asleep. - Yes, that was too intense. This is so surreal. You are truly sick. I admit that it is strange and scary, but it's also pretty cool? It would be a lot more fun, if he would keep his mouth shut. I did not mean to scare you. Do not worry, nothing will happen. This reminds me of a joke. Will you hear him? Tell me. - Only if he's funny. He is. I thought that was when I got him through the mail. Tell that joke now. Charles Manson... Come on. It's just a joke, and I want to hear him. I hear. - Very funny, Mel. Charles Manson walks with a guy in the woods. The guy turns around and says, "This is a very scary forest." To which Charles says to him: "Shut up now." "I'm the one who still only to walk out of the woods." That's so silly. I do not understand. Who is Charles Manson? Do not you know who he is? The biggest serial killer in the world. I still do not understand him. He takes him into the woods to murder him. And he must alone walking back in the dark. Still not funny. Who wants to investigate? Now? - Right now. I am many things, but I'm not at night to run the farm. That's the smartest thing you've said today . "I still do not get it." You're all wimps. This should be an adventure. We'll do it tomorrow. Tomorrow we have to go through everything properly, because there is plenty to be found here. I go to bed. Good idea. - Me too. I'm tired from all that walking. - Whatever. Does not this house what those 'The Blair Witch Project "? Shut up now. Soon you still see of those red handprints. Donkey, stop it now. Just go to bed. You go too far, mate. - Goodnight. Good morning. Did you sleep well? - Yeah, pretty good actually. What time is it? - It's a quarter past twelve. We really slept long. Fixed the long drive yesterday. Shut up. I want to sleep. - No, come on. Get up. Do you know where we can get water? The tap in the kitchen is not working. - No. Should Look at you. Way we came to a creek. He will also walk around the grounds. Let's go find today. - Thanks, Dad. Come on. Get up. No, I'm tired. - Come Natasha. Rise. - No. Help me with breakfast. Do it yourself. Look. What is it? People come this way. What are they doing here? We will so find out. Are there really people? Yes, I think a bunch of campers. See that guy. He looks like a redhead 'Wolverine'. How are you? - Good. I'm Jason, and this here's Donkey. I'm Alyssa and this is Gordon. - Hello, nice to meet you. We thought we were the only ones. Yes, we. Where are you from? - Sydney. We have been traveling around Australia working. A few backpackers have us four weeks ago told about this place. We wanted to show you. Are they still there? Since that conversation we have not seen them. Where are you from? - We are from the East Coast. But his girlfriend is American. But can they do anything about. Nice to meet you. Come in. I hope you have hunger, because we just wanted to make breakfast. Good idea. We are starving. We walk for days. These are cold. This is typically Australian. - You could not cook it? What then? There is no microwave or so. Do you know who Charles Manson? You do not know who Charles Manson? - No, I do not know. Alyssa knows. - Everyone knows who Charles Manson. She's right, Mel. How did you get here? - These two Bastards. I know what you mean. Gordon really wanted to go here. I thought it was a urban myth, until I saw the house. Yes, we. Wait. I want to show you something. What is it? I think I'm going crazy. What did you lose? Her sense. They just said. What happened? When we went to bed, I had the bear. But now he's gone. He is not in my bag. I have to bear, yes. What is it? - Can you come in? Here we go. Let's see what's going on. What is it? Do either of you her bear yesterday caught? Why would we do that? You do not look at me. I have not touched him. Maybe he walked back to the room. There's something weird happened tonight when we were sleeping. It was only for a second. I saw someone standing in the doorway and watch us. It sounds like you're dreaming. Is one of you stood up? - No, it was not one of them. This person was really huge. Maybe it was a nightmare. After all those stories Mick yesterday. Yes, you're right. Okay ladies. Do it later but busy. I now really want to leave. Can we drop our stuff to that from you? I have not imagined me. He was here. - I've seen him. He was lying next to you. Cleanup. I have an idea. Why not divide us in couples? That's a good idea. Do you agree? - No problems with it. I do not know. Is not it better to stay together? We only have a few hours to see everything . Then we leave. Mel, nothing will happen. You must pay attention to her. You know I do. It's all right, Mel. It is like "Crocodile Dundee." Where are your shoes? Have I forgotten. Go ahead. I'm coming. This is the plan. Is back at the house before dark. Remember where you go, so you can find your way back. I do not, but there. Here we go. What did your shoe? You sit now in the other camp? Do you think the story is true? Why? What have you heard? Just what those backpackers have told us. They say that it is haunted. They love chasing ghosts. It haunts not there. You've seen it now. It's all nonsense. I do hope we get to see something. We have traveled eight hours. You wanted so much around here. It would be nicer if we would see something another. He fed it from there. He had there all outward already. Are you serious? He even such 'Halloween' mask. - Excuse me. This is a Limited Edition 'Jason Voorhees' mask. You're right. He really likes it. There's nothing wrong with that. I have a real 'Freddy Krueger glove. Boys with their toys. - You're just jealous. I'm so jealous of your toys. - She's jealous. Gadver Donkey. That stinks enormously. - I did not do anything. There something stinks here. It probably comes from the mine shaft. Maybe a leaking oil barrel or so. This is not oil. It smells like a dead emu. Dead emu? How do you know how to smell a dead emu? I do not know. That can? You're right. I saved your life! Indeed. Let's go. We see each other a few hours later? Comes well. - Sure. I'm going to find a dead body. At least one finger. See you soon again. Good luck with him. - Yes, thank you. Is this a good idea? We do not have to worry about us. This is a great moment for Donkey to be alone with Melanie. What are you thinking? So easy it is not. You got that right. Can I ask you something? Do you want when we get back are a bunch with me? That's not the answer I was hoping for. What exactly do you mean? - Whether you want a time out with me? You and me. Mick, would you be my boyfriend? Yes, you think well? For someone with bad talk you into it along from asking someone. I do not do it that often. I think you have a little fun. - A little? You just want to about me. Only if you play it right. Come and sit here. Thought not. - Come on. Really. That thing is awfully nasty. I'm going to swim. You coming? - I have nothing to swim in. Come in now. Keep dreaming. Swim in your underwear. Do you really in? - Really. Come on. It will be fun. Come on. Is it cold? It's nice when you sit in it. And the crocodiles then? - There are no crocodiles. Come in now. Come on. Come on. There's your camera. Throw it. It is water resistant. Turn around. So really it is not. It's freezing. It's freezing. Maybe it's locked. - Are you serious now, Columbo. Let rounds. Watch this baby again? - Put it down. I'm serious. That thing is dangerous. - Make her! I'm serious. Put it down. We will come back for this thing. Schijterd. You smell it? It smells like something has died. A dead animal likely. Nasty. Maybe... ... it is one of Charlie's victims. Stop. That's not funny. A drum for the campfire. Look at this. Some things are almost 50 years old. If she just disappeared and everything left that way. That scares me a little. There's nothing to be afraid of. I know, but I just love not like places like this. You know that. Look at that old bed? What is it? There has for years no one slept. - It seems like there has recently been slept in. Maybe someone sleeps here. I can tell you that there has long no one has slept in that bed. As I see it seems like there until someone has set in. I seriously doubt, Alyssa. But to put your confidence I will tell the others what we have discovered. I think that's a good idea. Let's go. Really! Why not? Why we are here. I'm not going in there. I'm afraid. Give me five minutes and then we leave. I keep waiting here. - Just come and look quickly. I have a bad feeling about it. I just stay outside. Suit yourself. I want to watch. You are stupid! Can they still do not reach. - The range there is also poor. I know that... ... but I hoped they would see that in there is nothing... ... and would come back again. I called Natasha's brother, and he said her boyfriend often into trouble. What do you mean? He's always in the wrong place at the wrong time . That happens when you do sometimes. I'll see if I can find them. They are old enough to cope. Want to join? - Absolutely not. I do not go there. If you want to go there, you go only. I do not know. It bothers me that they're there. I drive down there and see if they are there, and I'll bring them back. You said they stayed two nights. Let them anyway. I can not, Nance. I see you in a few hours. Look at this. That's the Loch Ness monster. Come here. Exciting. My God. He is gigantic. - He will not hurt you. No. He is gigantic. That's a man. - What the hell? What do you look, pervert? Get out. Where are you going? - I'll make sure he leaves. Just stay here. - Be careful. What is your problem? Just go away. Yes, I know. Frightening, is not it? Not so close. - It is well. I think he's retarded. Nice. Please stop! What are you doing? Those five minutes are now definitely over. Jason, you behave like a fool. This is something that Donkey would. Say at least that everything is in order. I told you this was a bad idea! Jason, stop that nonsense! You're acting like a jerk! Boys? Jason, please! Where are you? Natasha. Here. What are you doing? Just come here. What are you doing? This is not funny. There's someone there. I swear I'm not kidding. I just saw something or someone. I really mean it. Whoever it was, he was gigantic. I swear. Shut up. - I saw a man outside. Shut up. - No. Runs as a basket around, and who will murder us. I'm not kidding. Come on. - No, I will not go. We have to go. - No I do not want. Bowl. This side. Who is that? Are you listening to me? Here. Stay away from me. I do not wanna die. Is that you, Jason? Where is Natasha? Where is she? What is wrong with you? Calm down! Let's not do anything stupid. One of us is going to hurt. Okay. We have to help him. - No, do not go. Stay here. Run! Help me. - Quiet. Was he? Look at me. Is that Charlie? He's down there. Bowl. Hurry up. We have to go. Where are the police? Why did you the police take? The police are not here. I am alone. Hurry up, otherwise you he got us. If you had not gone here, then we would not be in trouble. If you had killed him 30 years ago, then my friends were now not dead. Get in the car. What are you doing? Catch me, Charlie. Fuck you, Charlie! Translation: Sheeba & Lain
