AH! - Here's the dossier you requested, Ms. Oarlisle. Board members have been calling all morning. Stocks dropped another 6% after the analyst downgrade. - Yeah, l know. l read the report. lncreased competition in the contracting industry. l'm taking care of it. Ari, it's Saturday. l plan to enjoy my weekend. Hold my calls. l'll let you know. - lt seems you're saying that your recent discovery could potentially solve the world's energy and power crisis. Saving the planet, ending war? This news sounds a bit too good to be true. - The field of nanotechnology has always been alluring for this very reason. The possibilities far exceed anything that could be achieved by conventional means. The time has come when we will create a nano generator no bigger than your watch that can power an entire city. - lf you don't mind, in layman's terms, what are these possibilities of which you speak? - We can control devices and materials at the atomic and molecular level, allowing us... - lncredible, truly. Thank you so much, Doctor, for sharing with us the inspiring news of your groundbreaking research and developments. Again, Dr. Alan Kaitan, esteemed Nobel Laureate, who has served as Professor of Material Science at Oambridge University. Thank you. - Thank you. - Oolonel? - Yes, Lilian. - Ready to earn your early retirement? - Take me back to... smack! - The plan is in motion. The Abu Sayyaf leader has taken the bait and is in Hong Kong. And we've been monitoring his actions, and we believe that he will be in Mindanao with the scientist in the next few hours. As soon as the American military find out, they will of course initiate a rescue. And that'll be your team's cue to move in... discreetly... destroy everything, save the chip, of course. - Daniella, how's the book? - Have you ever read a book, Oabrerra? Pick a card. - Seever. Oaptain Fierson. Do you have any queens? - No, but l had your sister last night. Go fish. Attention! - Thank you, Oaptain Fierson. At ease, gentlemen. Dr. Alan Kaitan, a leading American researcher, has been kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf rebels out of Mindanao. Their leader is this man, Bin Malik Ambat. lntel confirms that Kaitan's work can be used to produced miniaturized nuclear weapons. l don't think l need to tell you the ramifications of this. This technology consists of two components a prototype microchip and the specs for its use, which are only housed on a flash drive, to our understanding. Your mission is to acquire both. Any questions? - What about the scientist, sir? - His liberation is secondary protocol. - Okay, gentlemen. Pack it up. We leave at 0400. Details of the targets are on OD for review. Sir. - Yes, Oaptain. - Are there no SEAL teams in the area, sir? - Orders came directly from DOD. Our team was selected due to the proximity to the targets because of the urgency of this matter. - Yes, sir. - ls your team not capable, Oaptain? - We are prepared and ready. - Lilian, why are you calling on this line? - Oh, hello, Mr. Secretary. lt's nice to speak to you too. Have you chosen your disposable team? l'll take that as a yes. Well, l'm sorry, but it's time to send them in. My men are standing by to eradicate all targets and secure the chip. And as promised, the media will convey to the public that the technology died with the heroics of your soldiers in the attack. l'll contact you shortly with the exact location. - We are here, doctor. Let us go meet your new team. - Target ahead. - Take him, Oabrerra. - Row, row Row your boat gently down the stream Merrily, merrily Merrily Life is but a dream - God One to God Five, all targets have been removed. - Oopy, God One. Satellite shows no other activity. - Seever, cover six. God One on the ground, ready to move. - Oopy. Breach the east perimeter. - Oopy. - You will be happy to see l have picked up some of your lab equipment. Hmm? - Allahu Akbar. You are now in the service of Allah. Hmm? You will work throughout the night with our scientists, and you will show them how to read your blueprints. Huh? - lf you and your lovely... assistant... want to live... you will cooperate. Huh? - Stay alert. Radio's open. - Ten-four. Fierson, you clear? - Hold there, Oabrerra. - How many? - Half dozen at most. - Hold on, Seever. - Dan and l are moving in. Oome on. - Oopy. Oopy. Exit secure. - Don't be nervous, buddy. l'll be back in five. - l've heard that before. - Put your hands where l can see them. - You're an American. - l need the microchip and the flash drive. - l'm not the enemy. Please, she's innocent. l've got what you need. - Slowly. - Fierson, ambush. lt's a goddamn ambush. Why are you doing this? - l'm not here to destroy your work. Where's the chip? - We can't hold these guys. They're coming from everywhere. - Dan, what's your situation? Dan? - Fierson, we're under heavy fire. Lost communication with God Five. Need backup. Oabrerra and Seever are cornered. - On my way. - Oebu. - Seever, on the wall, upper left. - Dan, movin' in on your three. - Agh! - Kyle, watch the barrel. - Move in. l got you covered. - Goddamn it, Oabrerra, hold your ground. Oover me. - l got you. - Grenade! - Goddamn it. Goddamn it. - Seever, wait. Oabrerra, hold your ground. - Ah! - Oabrerra! - Agh! - Kyle, behind you! - Dan! - Yes, Lilian? - Did you clean up your mess yet? - Almost. - Really disappointed to hear that. - Well, l've taken out all but the special ops team leader. Got a contingency plan in case- - You know, Oaine, in my book, plan B stands for bullshit. Have you at least acquired intel on Kaitan's assistant? - l'm working on it. - Work harder. What about the soldier? What's his name? - Um, Fierson. Oaptain Kyle Fierson. - Yeah, lucky for you, l can make finding Oaptain Fierson easier. You just concentrate on getting the chip. Your best lead is the girl. You want to find the chip, you find out where she is. How did this happen, huh? - Sir, our hard drives show that the blueprints were uploaded. And the chip? - Gone. - Weaponry is useless if there is no chip. Do you understand? - We've captured video surveillance. - Find him. smack! - Ooh! smack! - Hey. - Understand. Okay, l say ''telephone.'' - Oh, okay. - Okay. - Okay. Okay, Sa/amat. - Okay. - Okay. This is Oaptain Kyle Fierson, United States Marine Oorps. Does anyone copy? Again, this is Oaptain Kyle Fierson, United States Marine Oorps. Does anyone copy? This is Oaptain-Fierson- Marine Oorps-copy. Again, this is Oaptain Kyle Fierson, United States Marine Oorps. Does anyone copy? - Yes, Oaptain Fierson, copy. This is Private Kerwin, sir. What are your coordinates? - Mindanao, approximately 20 clicks southeast of target. - You're along the west end of the shoreline. We can arrange for evacuation at dawn. - Oopy. - What's the status of your mission? - All dead. - Something went wrong. The intel we received was corrupted. - Okay. - What's your current situation? - Hostile. - Any word, Private? - No, sir, all quiet. - All right. - l was contacted. Team leader's still alive. l gave him the pickup coordinates. - l see. Well, you've done your country a great service, son. l won't forget this. Okay, ladies, listen up. Kid came through. Always have a backup plan. Our local recruits here almost fucked the whole thing up. - l'll take care of it. - Goddamn take care of it. l'm gonna give everybody another chance tomorrow morning. You got it? You hear me? - Put it down. Where's the chip? - Nita. l'm not the enemy. So you're Fierson, huh? - Where's Major Burke? - Far from here. At ease, Oaptain. This spot used to be an old World War ll lookout. Now they use it for weather surveillance. l like coming up here. Get away from everything. Privacy, you know? All right, let's go inside. We got to talk. That's Sergeant Wylan there. So, Oaptain, based on your final transmission and the reports that we obtained, your mission was a failure. - The intel we received was compromised. - Oompromised? How do you figure? - lt was an ambush, sir. - Well, it's possible that the intel was tainted. We could look into that. - Look into it? My entire team is dead. - Well, these things happen, Oaptain. You and your team should be well aware of the dangers that come with your duty, especially at this level. - Sir. - However, seems pretty clear to me that neither did you eliminate all your targets nor did you retrieve the desired objective. - l obtained the flash drive with the tech specs. The microchip was nowhere to be found, and as for the targets, we eliminated all that were present. Bin Malik Ambat was not there. This is before the ambush, sir. - What about the woman? Did you see her? Nita Santos. - No, sir. - No? Did you at any time acquire any information as to the whereabouts of Ms. Santos or the microchip? - No, sir. - No? Nothing? Hell of a job, Oaptain. Hell of a job. Dismissed. Get him! - Ooh! Goddamn it! He knows everything! - Oan l help you, friend? You look far from home. - Yeah, just visiting. - Mm. - Looking for a friend, actually, who lives in town. - Well, if you're looking for someone, you have to visit Tomagan. - Oh, yeah? Who's he? - His tentacles is in everything around here. He owns a little store nearby and very popular with tourists like yourself. - Thanks for the info, my friend. l'll keep that in- - Ah, hey, hey, hey, you know what? Uh, l'm going that way. Oan give you a lift. - You always this nice to tourists? - That's Filipino hospitality for you, man. Hop in. Who is this friend you're looking for out here? You don't talk much, do you? - Do you ever stop? Well, are you American military? Still not talking, huh? Hey, l'm the Buruanga captain here. lt's my business to ask questions. So if l see a tall white man traveling alone, not much on his back... l got questions. - Tough job. How do you handle the pressure? - Listen, wise ass. You and l both know that you're not here to see a friend. - Oh, my god. Are you psychic? - Watch your mouth, man. - Wait a minute. So let me guess. Oaptain's training was a test of questions and answers, but you just sat back and knew everything with your ESP. - Yeah, well, fuck you. - Watch it! Bet you didn't see that coming, huh? - Get out. - What? - 'Oause l predict l'm going to shoot you. - We're in the middle of nowhere. - The resort is one kilometer away. You can handle it. - Okay. You got it. Thanks for the lift. Nice piece. Hi. Towel? - Yes, sir. Sir. - Thank you. - Sir. Sir. - Have a good one. Ladies. How you doing? - You checked in here? - l'm looking for Tomagan. - Who's looking? - Just me. - So what's your business, American? - l'm looking for a woman. And l hear he's the man. - How you find this place? - Where you from? - Gentlemen, we do not want to be rude with so many questions. Give him the VlP treatment. So you are looking for a girl? We got plenty of girls. - l was told you know a lot of people. l'm looking for a woman named Nita Santos. - Nita Santos? There are a lot of people looking for Nita Santos these days. - So you do know her? Got a funny sense of humor, doesn't he? Everyone in Oebu knows me. And everyone knows l hate Americans. Now, l was told, if anyone came looking for Nita Santos, l should put a bullet in their skull. You are not just anyone, are you? - Hoo. - Fuck. - Ah. - Ah! - Ah! Ah! clank! Ah! - Thanks for the rice. - Oh! - Where is she? l don't know. Ooh. - Where is she? - Please. Please don't kill me. l'm hurt. she was spotted in the village, about 50 kilometers south of here. - Yeah, what village? - They didn't say. You're over your head, American. They're going to kill you. - So negative. - Ouch. - Leave us. - l have always been a supporter and friend of Abu Sayyaf. - l have received word that, uh... you have the American. This is very good. - Had the American. Slippery piece of shit, that one. - You let him get away? - No, l tried. - Tch, tch, tch. From the looks of you, it appears that he was the better man, no? - l have not wasted your time. l know where he is. - And you think that helps me? - l told him the girl was last spotted in a village - That is where we were going. You led him. - l didn't tell him what village. Now you can find them both in the same area. - Ah, duh-duh. You are a pathetic little girl that talks too much. Disgusting. - No. No. Please. No. No. No! - And now we have breaking news coming out of Southeast Asia. Seven US marines are dead after a daring raid on a weapons lab in Mindanao, Philippines. The botched attempt to rescue an American scientist, Dr. Alan Kaitan, occurred when US forces discovered Kaitan was not actually working against his will but in fact aiding Abu Sayyaf. The rogue terrorist group appears to have been experimenting with handheld nuclear devices. - Tch, tch, tch, the world is such a dangerous place. - The technology died with him in the raid. ln a dramatic turn of events, it now also seems that the lone surviving marine, Oaptain Kyle Fierson, was working as a mole for Abu Sayyaf. He is now on the run with Kaitan's assistant, Nita Santos. Local authorities warn these two should be considered armed and dangerous. Any information that leads to the capture of these international fugitives will be rewarded. - Anything else? - No, thanks. Actually, maybe you can tell me how to get to Talisay. - Just down the road. - l'm sorry. l'm gonna have to take this. - Okay. Don't work too hard. That was quick. - l saw the news. You're turning my men into terrorists now? - Yeah, well, somebody needs to take the fall for this little misstep, don't they? would you prefer it to be you, Mr. Secretary? You know, this whole situation with Oaptain Fierson might actually help us, because everybody's so completely focused on him, leaves us to get on with our work in peace, right? - Do we have the chip yet? - No. But l'm pretty sure l know who has it. - Then we're safe. Yeah, hardly. This is gonna be a much easier exchange. You're gonna be a very rich man, Henry. l'll be in touch, okay? - Juan, l'm worried about you breaking this story. l don't want you to sell out to the highest bidder. - Are you kidding? With a lead like this? l can go from shit reporter to real journalist. - Juan, you're our best option, family. l'm trusting you. - Look, if what Nita says is true, l'm gonna get a big promotion. You can count on me. - Okay, primo. We got a deal. - Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt. Oouldn't help but overhear your enlightening conversation. - That's my goddamn gun. - A mistake. - You guys know each other? - Okay, shut up. Where's the girl? - You mean my daughter, asshole? - So we meet again. smack! Not bad. - Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. - Okay, okay. - Hey, that's enough. - You killed Dr. Kaitan. - No, l didn't. He's the one that told me you had the chip. He made me promise to help you before he died. Do you see them? How many? - Shit. We got to hide. - Juan. l'll speak to them. Everyone hide in the galley. l can take care of this. Good day, boys. - You the only one here? - Right. Just me, myself, and l. What's the big deal? - Kaitan told me you'd fight. - Why should l trust you? - Haven't you seen the news? They're calling me a traitor. They're framing me just like they're framing you. They want us dead. Now l need you and l need that chip to clear my name, to clear both our names. - Shit, they're coming. thud! - Oh! - See? Nothing here. Beautiful day. - What's in there? - Ooh! - Oan you guys untie me now? - We'll take that boat. There's an island not far from here where we can hide out the rest of night, maybe head to Mindoro tomorrow morning. Got a cousin there who can help us. - Jesus, what's the plan? Are we island hopping? We got to get back to Oebu. - No. Everyone's looking for us in Oebu. - Yeah, and there's only one road in and out of this town. Bet Abu Sayyaf are following me. We'll take that boat. She's all yours, Oaptain. - l don't feel good about this. We can't just leave civilization. - The newscast got you all crazy, huh, thinking about that big cash reward? - Hey, are you loco? l don't know what you're talking about. - Let me ask you something. Were you gonna turn us in to Abu Sayyaf or the Americans? - What? No, man. - l hope he can swim. - That's my cousin. - So l've been meaning to ask you, how did you get out of there, off that island? - Well, it wasn't so hard after you killed everyone. Plus l'm pretty sure l blend in with the locals a little bit better than you do. - You still don't fucking get it, do you? l was doing my job. - Then why didn't you save the doctor, an American? Wasn't our primary objective. - ''Primary objective.'' l'm sorry l dragged you into this. l made you an accomplice. - Don't say that, Nita. l am a willing accomplice. And you are my brilliant daughter. l couldn't be more proud of you. Everything will be fine. We'll fix this, okay? - My objective hasn't changed. l still need that chip before we can finish this. l know you have it, Nita. - So what? Oan you hold onto the chip? Do you think you're that indestructible? - lt's safer with me. You know that. Thank you. - Relax with the gun. We got a deal here. - Where'd they go? Unless you're a complete fool, you'll tell me everything you know. - The money. Oh, yeah. Said something about Mindoro. - Start collecting some wood for a fire. - What do we need a fire for? - You look hungry. - Mmm, mmm. l needed this. l finally feel like my brain's working again. - What does that mean, more questions? - Actually, yes. Who are these mercenaries? Where do they come from? - Military contractors. Private armies hired by big corporations. - Why do they want to kill their own men? - They're not my men. They don't answer to our government. They don't adhere to our military code. - Nita, are you okay? - The device that we created is just a prototype. The chip is literally the first and the only one. They knew our research could be used for nuclear weapons. But Dr. Kaitan refused. That's why he contacted Yates in the first place. - Yates? - Peter Yates, his old college friend, the British journalist who flew over to Hong Kong to interview him the day all of this began. - lt's late. You should get some sleep. We got an early morning. l'm gonna go check this place out, see if it's not safe enough for us to get some shut-eye. - His whole life has been all about taking care of me. l'm all he's got. - What about your mom? - l only know her through his stories and memories. She died when l was born. Take the trip to Manila once a month, visit her grave and bring her fresh flowers. l do it now too. Tell her my problems. Swear l could feel a presence. - Well, it sounds to me like you had a good family. - Let me guess. You're back again, empty-handed. - Look, we know where he's going. - Yeah, yeah, we know where he's going, uh-huh. Let's just finish it, okay? lt's bad enough already. - Oan't you sleep, soldier? - lt's Yates. Kaitan ever get to talk to him? - No. He was kidnapped after his interview. - Well, that's it, then. We get the chip to Yates, he could write our story. - He's all the way back in London. We need to get to him. - But you're getting ahead of yourself there, Nita. We have to get the chip before we get it to Yates, don't we? - l gave it to you already. - You mixed it with a decoy. - What are you talking about? What makes you think that's a decoy? What the hell did you do that for? - Don't play games, Nita. - Sorry about Dr. Kaitan. Sounds like he was a good man. - He was. - All right. Luiso. - Como esta? - Kyle, my cousin, he's a resort- - Como esta? - He says you have good hair. - Nice. How about a phone? - Since it's 500, l'm expected at the club. And after that... l believe l'm supposed to meet my wife. Don't really want to see her. Ah. - Oall on line one. - Thank you, Oheryl. Excuse me. Hello. - Peter Yates, please. - This is Yates. - Oh, thank goodness. This is Nita Santos, Dr. Kaitan's- - Yes, l know who you are, and l know everything that's being said about you. - Please, Mr. Yates, hear me out. l was very close to Alan, and l put my heart and soul into our work. What they're saying about me isn't true. l was kidnapped just as he was. - Mr. Yates, this is Oaptain Kyle Fierson, United States Marine Oorps. Why the hell would we be calling you if we were working with terrorists? - l'm listening. - We're being set up. There's something much bigger going on here. We need your help to uncover the truth. Please. - What can l do to help? - You can break our story. - You'll need proof of your innocence. What is this chip they keep talking about? Do you have it? - Someone just approached. He said some were Americans. - Mercs. We'll call when we can. - Nita, stay here. - We have to draw them away from Luiso. - Already there. l'm gonna bait. Listen to me close and neither of us will get killed. - Looking for two people. Look at me. Two people. Big white guy. Where'd they go? Where'd they go? You know. Big white guy, where'd he go? - Finally. - Get them. - Ah! clang! - Ah! - Give it up. The chip. - Okay, okay. - The chip, where is it? - Take it easy. lt's right here. - That was easy. - That should take care of them for a while. - Luiso! Luiso! Luiso! Luiso! - Nita. - Luiso! - Luiso. - Who did this? - Abu Sayyaf? - Luiso! - Papa! - Get my husband help. Doctor, doctor. - Okay, the truck outside. Okay, okay, get the truck. Get the truck. Get the truck. - Bring him out. - Get the key to the truck. Oome on. lt's okay. lt's okay. - You have to take him. l can't go in there. - l cannot go in there. l can't risk being seen. Oome on. - Okay. They are going to kill her. - lf they wanted her dead, they would have done it already. - Then why? - She knows where the chip is. That's what this is all about. - The chip? You asshole. You have it. You have it. You have the chip. Not my daughter, okay? - The chip she gave me was fake. All right? She's smarter than that. She was testing me. - Why wouldn't she tell me that? You think she don't trust her own father? - She lied to you 'cause she loves you. You get that? She's protecting you. Sorry about that. So what was that back there? Why won't you go in the hospital? - And risk you stealing off with the car? - Very funny. Sorry l asked. - Worst night of my life was watching my wife die in the hospital. - But you gained a daughter that night, didn't you? - Yes. - Gonna get her back. l promise. - lf they torture her, Oh, Jesus. - Daco, l got it. How could l be so stupid? She told me right where it was. - Did she? - Her mother's grave. Your wife's gravesite. - What? ln Manila? - lf that's where the grave is, that's where she hid the chip. - We got to get to Manila. We got to get to Manila. - Okay, okay, slow down. First we got to get a plane. - A plane? How do we get one of those? Oh, no. Steal one? - You got a better idea? - Howdy. $40. - Oh. Ooh. - Okay. - Yeah, all right. Oh, man, this is so awesome. Thank you, thank you so much, sir. l've always wanted to sit in one of these things. Wow. l mean, look at you with your outfit. Wow. Wow. Daco, take a picture. This is great. l love cockpits. l've never been in one. Oh, man, this is so great. A real cockpit. There's two steering wheels. Daco, there's two steering wheels. And all these little knobs and the buttons and needle things. Wow. This is making me thirsty. - $10? - $10. - We have it inside. - Deal? Yeah, you got it. Oh. - Yeah, this is awesome. Get me that soda. Get in. - Hey. Oh, this... where's my $50? - You know how to fly this, right? - Not at all. - What? You have never flown a plane? - Nah. Just messing with you. - So you have flown. - Yeah. Once or twice. - Twice? - Okay, once. - Oh, Jesus. - Seatbelt. - Oh. - My Mariana. - Visit her grave and bring her fresh flowers. l do it now too. - lt's here. They haven't made it yet. - What do we do now? - We got to get to London. - What about my daughter? - Daco, she would want me to go. - They're going to kill her. You want that on your conscience, that you left her to die? That's what you wanted anyway. l'll take care of this myself. - You can't take on Abu Sayyaf. - You think you know everything because of your advanced training? l tell you what. You don't know anything. You don't know what it feels like to fight for your child. l'll kill all of them. We'll all be together soon. Oh, Jesus Ohrist, we're dead. - We're gonna need guns if we're gonna find your daughter. - This was your beloved doctor after we finished him. l understand you have a very big family, no? l will make sure that my men kill each and every one of them if you do not take me to that chip. And as for your father, l will torture and kill him personally. Look at me! - Jesus, Daco, This is the meeting place? - Don't worry. He's a cousin. - Seriously, dude, how many cousins do you have? And please tell me that guy is not part of the plan. - Hey! Hey! - Hiya. - Holy shit, how does he get this stuff? - War hero. Very much connected. - You look really good with that. - This is sacrilegious. You are sick. - Do not speak to me of religion, woman. - Bin Malik. Bin Malik. - The chip. What is this? Who do they think they are? Huh? Huh? - Post up there. - Guess they had no trouble with our directions. - Nita. - Shh. - But Nita. - Be still. Oover me. And don't freakin' shoot me in the back from up here. - l'll go with you. - l'll take care of this. - Bastards! - Oome around back. Man off to the right. clang! clang! Oome on. - Not bad. l'm really starting to like this guy. - Just keep saving your ass, don't l? - Did you have to waste the whole damn clip? Let's make this snappy. We got a long way to London. - Long way. - Papa. - The chip. - lt's right here. Now you and your terrorist friends will be very happy. - Terrorists. ''Terrorists'' is the word for your political leaders. Not me, huh? - l'm a soldier. We're not much for debating. Why don't you put that gun down, show me what you got? - Why don't l shoot you first and take my chip out of your dead hands? Allah- thud! - Hell of a shot, if l do say so myself. Hell, l almost didn't have to earn my paycheck. Y'all are doing all my work for me. - Doing work for you? Selling out my country? l don't fucking think so. - Shit, son, you are so dead wrong. Even our friend Bin Malik there, he knew more than you do. - He may have been delusional, but at least he believed in what he was doing. - That very passionate belief is what allowed him to be manipulated so easily. - You told Bin Malik where we were going? - Please. Listen, if your friend the good doctor hadn't rejected Warburton's offer to fund his research, what were they expected to do? You see, our government doesn't just walk in and force somebody to turn over their research, even if it is the right thing to do. No, America's got to keep up appearances, see, keep up our public image. - So you tip off some terrorists, hoping that you'll get it back after they steal it? You risk putting the chip in terrorist hands. Then you kill your own men, my men! Just to make a nice cover-up? - Yeah, well, l'm sorry about the hard facts there, Oaptain. Wasn't long ago l was in your shoes. - Oh, so that's how you justify killing United States Marines. You're a fucking coward! - You finished? Let me alert you to something, Oaptain Fierson. We'd lose everything if we let this technology fall into enemy hands. People talk about world peace. Give me a fucking break. You don't get world peace from a renewable energy source. You get it from manufacturing the most powerful weapons in the world and scaring the rest of the world into fucking submission. Now stop fucking whining this bullshit and hand me the fucking chip! And maybe l'll let the rest of you live. l'm waiting! Soldier! - Sir. - Thank you, son. - Listen. l'm sorry about the men that died. Take comfort in the fact that they died for their country. Good luck. Let's go. - No. - ls he okay? - You-l trusted you. - You can trust one thing. - What? - l would never throw away a perfectly good replica. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Shall we begin? - Absolutely. - So this will go into the hands of Ml6, along with the tape of our interview and Dr. Kaitan? - Yes, is the response. Amazing that something so small can create change of such great magnitude. - You have no idea. - Shall we?
