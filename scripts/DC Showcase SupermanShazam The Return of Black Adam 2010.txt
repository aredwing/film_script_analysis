It's coming right at us! Aah! [RINGING] [YAWNS] [GRUNTING] [PANTING] [SNAP] Ew. Who's hungry? [SQUEAKING] Oh, take them all. I'm going to breakfast. Good morning, Miss Bambi. You sure look pretty today. [GIGGLES] Oh, come on, man. You really gonna take a bum's money? How am I gonna buy beer if this is all you have? TAWNY: Unh. BILLY: Hey, leave him alone. Mind your own business, little man. Then just leave him alone. [BILLY GRUNTING] - Ow. BOY: Got nothing to say now? TAWNY: Sorry, captain. The last thing I wanted was for you to get your ass whupped on my account. BILLY: Just trying to do the right thing, sir. And that is why you're the captain, man. You know, everybody nowadays is looking for change. Just want it to come from someone else, huh? Hey, um, speaking of, uh... Heh. Well, I hate to ask, but... - Only have a subway token. - Works for me. And next time you see me, I'll hit you back with some change, captain. Heh, sure. Holy moly. Is this all for me, Mr. Kent? Since you ate two breakfasts yesterday, thought I'd better order you three today. You really think the folks who read your paper care... ...about some kid from Fawcett City? I think they'll care a lot. I hope they'll do something... ...to help you and other kids in your situation. What's that on your face? Eh, it's what you get for trying to be good. Should have just kept my mouth shut. "Be good and good will follow." That's what my parents used to always tell me. You know, Mr. Kent, I was good before they were taken from me. I was good at the foster home. And I was good 15 minutes ago. I'm starting to think being good isn't good for me. It seems that way sometimes, doesn't it? But that's because good is hard. Bad is always easy. [CAR ALARM WAILING] [GROANING] I was not expecting a child. But you are marked by the wizard's energy. Chosen to one day inherit the mantle of power. L... I don't understand. What do you want from me? Your life. Hey, stay away from him. [GROANS] [GRUNTING] [YELLS] [GRUNTING] [GASPS] [TRUCK CRASHES] Huh? Superman. Stay here, son. You fight for the wizard? I fight for those who can't fight for themselves. [GRUNTING] [GROANING] Magic. BILLY: Why is he after me? I was gonna ask you the same question. [GRUNTING] Indeed, you are my physical match. But I sense one critical difference: A vulnerability to magic. [SUPERMAN GROANING] Another difference: Heat vision. [GROANS] - You did it. - Go. But you beat him. It's over. [RUMBLING] Go. [PANTING] [YELLS] - Hey, captain. Where's the fire? - Unh. Unh. Please, let go. You don't understand. Look, man. The change I promised. Right here. Well, it's a token, but I told you I'd pay you back. Now you can take the subway instead of hoofing it on foot. Pfft. You're welcome. [BILLY YELLS] [GASPS] [YELLS] Huh? Uh, hello? [GRUNTS] Whoa! Aah! [SCREECHING] Holy moly. SHAZAM: I was hoping this moment could wait until you were a bit older. Alas, the threat is upon us now, Billy Batson. You know my name? Oh, I know many things for I am the wizard Shazam. [GRUNTING] Whoa. Worry not. Black Adam cannot sense you here. Who's Black Adam? My gravest mistake. One for which today I will pay my penance. Millennia ago, I chose him to be this world's protector. He was entrusted with great powers, but his heart was corrupted by them. He fell victim to the same seven deadly enemies of man that all must battle. I was forced to banish him to the farthest star in the sky. I spent the next 5000 years making sure I would not repeat that error. I chose a new hero. - Who? - Why, you, of course. I've been watching you for some time, Billy. And now, bestowed with the wisdom, strength, stamina, power, courage... ...and speed of the gods... ...you will become our new protector. You will become Captain Marvel. But I'm no protector. No protector, you say? And yet despite enduring countless tragedies and hardships... ...you've somehow managed to protect your perfect heart. You, Billy Batson, are all that stands in the way of Black Adam... ...again unleashing tyranny upon us. - I can't. - You must. There. It is done. [GASPS] We have to get out of here. In your times of need, simply call on me. But this is my destiny. Go now. Live yours. [BILLY YELLING] [CRASH] [YELLING] [GRUNTS] [GROANING] One potential obstacle destroyed. Now to finish off the other. BILLY: Hey, leave him alone. What am I doing? You are alive. An impressive trick. Not as impressive as this one. [BILLY GRUNTING] [YELLS] [BLACK ADAM CHUCKLING] Amusing. The wizard finally gave you your powers... ...but neglected to show you how they work. Superman? Anyone? Need a little help here, Shazam. Holy moly. I'm big. [GRUNTING] Whoa, I'm strong. [WIND WHOOSHING] I'm fast. And I can fly. This is so cool. And all I had to do was say Shazam. Uh-oh. [YELLING] [GRUNTING] [IN MUTED VOICE] Shazam! [ECHOES] Shazam! Whew. That was close. [GRUNTING] [GROANING] I did not spend 5000 years traveling across the infinite void of space... ...to be thwarted by some man-child. [YELLS] Will a superman do, then? So you're what this is all about. I'm his replacement. Then let's replace him. [YELLS] [GRUNTING] [YELLS] [WORKER YELLS] - Why? - A necessary strategy. Divide and conquer. [SCREAMS] [WOMAN SCREAMS] [HORNS HONKING] [WOMAN WH IMPERING] Is this who I was to protect? Why, because they are weak? Put her down. When you crush an ant beneath your foot, do you feel remorse? No. Is this because you are evil... ...or because you recognize yourself as a higher form of life? This is what the wizard could not understand. If I have the powers of the gods, then am I not a god myself? Should I not be treated as such? Put her down. You want to be a protector? Then protect the soul. Revert to your mortal form and I will prove a benevolent deity. And then you'll just kill me. I will. [CRYING] Shazam. Now put her down. See? Like an ant. [SCREAMING] No! Shaz... Your last breath wasted on the wrong word. [GRUNTING] BLACK ADAM: How did you stop the flood? Cold breath, another power you don't have. No more. No more being weak. No more. No more. [GROANS] Easy there. You've got him. It changes you, does it not? The power. It only changes that I can choose my own fate now. Like a god, maybe. That's enough. No, I have to. To protect them. SUPERMAN: How? By being like him? By being stronger than him. Then be strong. Be good. [GRUNTING] This is not over, then. Only death will stop me. You're forgetting option number two: Banishment. I'll take it from here, captain. - Tawny. - You know the homeless guy? BLACK ADAM: Still the wizard's lackey, I see. [GROWLS] Lackey, kid's guardian angel, superhero talent scout. Guess I do a bit of everything. I was thinking this time, the wizard could send you so far across the universe... ...it'll take you 10,000 years to get back. No, not again. Oh, you better believe it. Shazam! [GROANING] TAWNY: Aged 5000 years in a single moment. Harsh. I thought the wizard was... [TAWNY CHUCKLES] As a doorknob. Nice work out there, captain. See you around. You have some unusual friends. Hey! Heh, heh. It's the hero. [BILLY GRUNTS] Oh, and look at that. Hero's got nothing to say. Come on, say something. I dare you. Come on, just one word. Morning, Mr. Brenner. I enjoyed your latest picture. Thank you, Deandre. [YAWNS] [BEEPING] [BEEPING INTENSIFIES] MAN: When most people think of L. A... ... they think of the bright lights and glamour of Hollywood. But those lights cast dark shadows. Shadows that hide even darker secrets. My name is Corrigan. I'm a cop and I have a few secrets of my own. - Haven't seen anything suspicious. - I'm surveying the area. We have the crime scene cordoned off. Yes, sir. Signs of explosives. We're running a trace on this. You weren't assigned this case, Corrigan. What gives? Don't worry, Brice. I won't take credit. Got a call from a friend. Jim. Thank God you're here. They killed my father, Jim. They killed him. We'll find out who did this. Can you think of anyone who would want your father dead? Dad had as many enemies as he did fans. Everybody was jealous of him. [CRYING] Did you see anything, uh? [BRITISH ACCENT] Flemming. I have been in Mr. Brenner's employ... ...for 20 years. You didn't answer my question. See anything? Besides the terrible aftermath, no. But I believe the security camera caught something. - Brenner have any enemies? - As many as any successful man. - Any recent altercations come to mind? - Several long-time collaborators... ...that Mr. Brenner did not use on his latest film were quite upset. I'm gonna need some names. [SIGHS] [CLANKING NEARBY] [CLACKING] [FLYNN GASPS] Unh. Who's there? I said, who's there? [FLYNN GASPS] Didn't expect to see me again, did you, Flynn? You're dead. We killed... BRENNER: Killed me? All because you got cut out of a job? That was worth my life? [PANTING] - Who are you? - I am vengeance. I am The Spectre. This is impossible. In the land beyond the living, all things are possible. [MONSTERS GROWL] [GROANS] [FLYNN GRUNTING] [HISSES] [FLYNN YELLS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [CREATURE SHRIEKS] [VAMPIRE GROWLS AND FLYNN YELLS] [SCREAMS] [GRUNTING] [YELLS] [FLYNN PANTING] [DOOR CREAKING AND FLYNN GRUNTING] [APE GROWLING] [SNARLING] No, please! [FLYNN SCREAMING] CAPTAIN: Corrigan, get your butt in here! Just what do you think you're doing? Working a case, captain. You know, my job. The murder isn't your case just because you had a thing with his daughter. It's Detective Brice's. How about you look into... ...whoever is knocking off our suspects? - Come again? One of Hollywood's top special-effects guys... ...was found squashed like a freaking bug this morning. He was on Brice's suspect list. I'll look into it. And maybe you should tell Brice to work faster. [GROWLS] [CAPTAIN YELLS] [ENGINE STARTS] [HORN HONKS] [GRUNTS] [GASPING] - Peter McCoy. - What the hell? Only a guilty man flees, Peter McCoy. [McCOY GASPS] Get away from me. As you wish, but you will never escape your fate. [SQUEAKING] [GRUNTS] No! [GRUNTING] [YELLS] [ENGINE STARTS] [GRUNTING] [ENGINE REVVING] [CAR CRASHES] Ah! Oh, Jim. I'm so glad you came. What's going on, Aimee? Just this. We always had something, didn't we? Once upon a time, maybe. Mm, run away with me, Jim. We could go anywhere, be together like this forever. You're good, kid. Your daddy should have let you star in his movies. - What do you mean? - You're not going anywhere, baby. Your father's death was an inside job. Wasn't a lucky guess... ...when the killers punched in the security code. You gave it to them. [AIMEE GASPS] But the real connection is the money, all new bills. Should be easy to trace them to your account. Jim, I'm rich now. You love me. We can be together. No dice. I could have given you the world. I left this world a long time ago. [AIMEE GRUNTS] You can't kill a dead man. The guilty must be punished for their crimes. [AIMEE WHIMPERING] [YELPING] [SCREAMING] [SIRENS WAILING] CORRIGAN: Sometimes there isn't a hell of a lot of satisfaction in my job. It's hard watching talented, beautiful people... ... throw their lives away for nothing. But this is a town where fame and fortune... ... too easily bring out the worst in people. When that happens, I'm here to avenge. That's my secret. I am The Spectre. REPORTER 1 [ON RADIO]: Now Sylvester the Skyman brings you traffic... ... from our WST news chopper. REPORTER 2 [ON RADIO]: Thanks, Pat. Well, we've got a massive jam... ... heading into and out of Star City International. Blame it on all the added security put in place for the royal arrival. REPORTER 1: It's not every day the princess of Vlatava pays our city a visit. - Cut her some... OLIVER: Cut me some. MAN [OVER PA]: Arriving international travel passengers should expect delay. WOMAN [ON MACHINE]: This is Dinah. I can't get to the phone right now. Uh, hey, it's me. I know it seems like I'm late again. But I'll meet you in baggage claim. Bye. Smooth, Queen. Real smooth. I mean, would it have killed you to say: "I love you. I can't live without you. Please don't take a cab home"? [HORN HONKS] Oh, come on. The arrow's green. Move! Whew. At least she's not waiting for a cab. Wait a minute. I know that guy. Is that.? Merlyn. Oh, this can't be good. Princess Perdita has disembarked. Her personal security detail is bringing her out now. Please stay behind the ropes. GUARD 1: This will just take a second. - We're sorry for the delay. All clear. MAN 1: I think that's the princess. GIRL: I can see her. [CROWD CHATTERING] MAN 2: Hello! Princess! MAN 3: Princess! Hello! [GRUNTS] [CROWD SCREAMING] MAN 4: Oh, my God. MAN 5: Run! [SILENCED GUNSHOT] GUARD 2: Move! Move! Take her back up! [CROWD SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [PERDITA SCREAMS] [HENCHMAN 1 COUGH ING] GREEN ARROW: Sorry I'm late. [GRUNTING] But you try changing clothes in a hybrid. [GRUNTING] Green Arrow. Justice League of America. I'm here to help. [HENCHMEN COUGHING] [GUNFIRE] Oh, crap. [GUNFIRE] [BEEPING] [BOTH YELL] Okay, princess. Arms around my neck and don't let go. [GROANS] Merlyn, the bird has flown. HENCHMAN 2 [OVER RADIO]: You have your green light. [BOTH PANTING] GREEN ARROW: Come on! [PLANE DRONING] GREEN ARROW: Whoa! That dragon almost got us. You do realize I'm 10 and do not require fairy-tale metaphors? Sorry. It's my first time rescuing royalty. It is quite a forgivable sin... ...Robin Hood. Thanks. I, uh... [GRUNTING] [GREEN ARROW YELLS] [GREEN ARROW GROANING] Your leg. Yeah. Minor setback. Unh. [YELLS] [YELLS] You're being very brave, princess. I'm proud of you. Can you make a bandage, tie it around my leg? Yes, of course. Any idea why these guys are trying to kill you, princess? Because I'm not a princess. My father died last night. I'm the queen now. You're even braver than I thought. Staying put's no longer an option, Your Majesty. Get ready to run. You can run? GREEN ARROW: You've got an uncle, right? A count? My only living relative. Count Werner Vertigo. - So if something happens to you... - He becomes king of Vlatava. Now it all makes sense. He's taken her back inside. Inform the client. [HENCHMAN 3 GROWLS] [BOTH GRUNTING] HENCHMAN 3: Kill you! Kill you! Kill you! Me? Weren't you after the kid? - Excuse me? - Kidding, Your Kidness. Kidding. [GRUNTING] [GROWLS] [YELLS] [YELLS] [GRUNTING IN SLOW MOTION] [PANTING] [YELLS] [CHUCKLES THEN GRUNTS] PERDITA: I got you! I got you! GREEN ARROW: No! Princess, let me go. Let me... [PERDITA SCREAMING AND GREEN ARROW YELLING] [BOTH GRUNT] So, Arrow, once again you've stumbled onto my stage... ...and horned in on my act. That's me. Always hogging the limelight. I seem to recall you lost our last duel. All eight of our last duels. - You lost? - Yeah, but I've been practicing. A lot. One arrow each? I accept your challenge. On three. - One. - Two. MERLYN & GREEN ARROW: Three. [COUGHING] What? [GROANING] MAN: If you want something done right... PERDITA: Unh. - Vertigo. Count Vertigo to you, peasant. [BOTH GROAN] Soon to be King Vertigo... ...once I've dispatched you and the little bi... WOMAN: Watch your mouth. [VERTIGO YELLS] [SCREAMING] [YELLS THEN GRUNTS] [VERTIGO GROANS] [GREEN ARROW GROANING] Ahh. What would you do without me? Well, now that you mention it, and since I'm on my knees anyway... I can't live without you, babe. Literally. Say yes. After all, every queen needs a consort. She's right. Every queen does. Ha, ha. Yes. The answer is yes. [LIVELY SALOON MUSIC PLAYING ON PIANO] [CAWING] [DOG GROWLS] [BARKING] [CROWD CHATTERING] And so he says to me that... [MUSIC AND CHATTERING STOP] RED: My name is Red Doc. And I can whip any man in the house and ride any filly in the place. Give me a fresh bottle, the good stuff. And don't keep a tip. I don't like you. Big boy, I'm Madame Lorraine. I'm ready to see you got the goods, but it'll cost you. Heh. On horseback, hanging from a chandelier. You name it. Hope your aim improves. You think I'm too drunk, don't you, honey? Come over here and sit by me. I'll show you what I can do. Let's make you comfy first. [LAUGHTER AND GUNFIRE] Get rid of him and make sure no one sees you. Like always, boss. I know who you are. You're that Jonah Hex. Congratulations. I could shoot six bottles off a fence and not miss a one. Who gives a damn? I could take you. [GULPS] [GASPS THEN GRUNTS] HEX: Seen him? - Can't say that I have. You sure? [RATTLING] - Uh-huh. - Put a drink on the bar and go away. I've seen him. Talk. I'll help you. Will you help me? What kind of help? Enough money to leave town. Got me a little paper route. Madame Lorraine. She picks the well-heeled ones. They go upstairs, they ain't never seen again. Take your reward. Hey, lardass, set up the house. [CROWD CHATTERING] [LIVELY SALOON MUSIC PLAYING ON PIANO] Hey, cowboy. How would you like to trade that drink for some real firewater upstairs? You asking because I'm so handsome? Because I think you can afford a good time. [WOMAN SQUEALING] How about we both get comfortable? I'm looking for a dead man named Red. Heh. A dead man. Now, why would I know anything about a dead man? [LORRAINE GRUNTING THEN GUNSHOTS] You wouldn't hit a lady. You ain't no lady. [DOOR CREAKS] [GRUNTING] [GUNSHOT] [GROANING] [YELPS] [SCREAMS] [WHIMPERING] [GUNSHOT] [CROWD SCREAMING] [BARTENDER GRUNTING] Drinks are on the house. [CROWD CLAMORING] WOMAN: I want a double. Give me the good stuff. [LORRAINE GROANS] - You hit me. - Hard as I could. Only gonna ask this once. Where's Red? [SCOFFS] He's gonna be a little ripe. [LORRAINE GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [GASPS] [LORRAINE GRUNTS] Well, now, you've had you a right smart business, ain't you? [FLIES BUZZING] [LORRAINE GRUNTING] LORRAINE: Wait. We could be partners. I don't mind splitting the take. Don't turn me in. I don't wanna go to jail. Wouldn't think of it. You can't leave me here alone. You ain't alone. You got plenty of company. And you know everybody there. [GASPS] [WHIMPERING]
