Thanks. This is what the DAhas: They can place him in the room, there is evidence of a fight. Full stop. That's it. I can help you. But if you go in there and say that you stabbed him - without him doing anything but look at his daughter... ...you'll get ten years. Where would Amanda be in all those years? Hi, Jan. - Congratulations. Kathrine? You are free now. You may leave. No! No! Go through it again! What's going on? Get me out! Listen to me! You get me out ofhere! Jesus! What the hell was that? I lost. I gave him my best defence. But he was sentenced. - Yes? Shall we celebrate the failure? - What are you talking about, Dad? That's not what we had hoped for. Now we'll study the verdict and decide whether to launch an appeal. Jonas? Hi. - Hello. Are you okay? - Sure. How did it go? - We won. Of course you did. - You are looking great. What are you doing here? - Well, it's one o'clock... I thought we might find a restaurant for lunch. And do what lovers do. Talk and so on... Talk? - Right. I'd love to. But I can't. Of course you can. - No, I have an important meeting. What's more important than me? - Very little, I can assure you. But I have... It is... What? - Well, it's about a new job. What new job? - Could we talk about it later? I need to go now. I'll tell you all about it tonight, and I'll cook a meal... Jonas Bechmann... Martin Schiller? - He's waiting upstairs. Jonas? Martin. - Hello. Nice seeing you. It's been a long time. Coffee? - No thanks. Congratulations on the verdict. - Thank you. Does your boss know you're here? - No, I quit. I see. How's Camilla doing? Still grinding family law into freshmen? Yes. You're a busy man, and I don't want to waste yourtime. As you know, your father's place has been vacant for a year now. We haven't been able to find a suitable candidate yet. The board was ready to shelve the whole thing. And suddenly we received this application. You may be the most talented defence counsel of your generation. And your name is already on the door. How do we get about this? Say, Jonas... Why did you apply for this position? I always wanted to work here. I've given you a lot of thought. - Okay. You've been having a tough time. I'm okay. Did you talk to anybody? About what? Your dad's accident? Nobody could have done anything. He could have won the case, couldn't he? What do you mean? - Kiehlert could easily have gone free. Then nothing would have happened. What are you hinting at? It doesn't matter what I think. It does to me. We both know that Kiehlert was into more than building and construction. You have represented him in a murder case before. I think his partners would lose a lot, if he was put in jail. They expected an acquittal, and afterwards they punished my dad. I think his car was pushed off the road by Bottker and Lessner- who worked for Kiehlert. But they are gone now, and there's no evidence- so it really doesn't matter what I think. Camilla tells me you stay up all night. My Dad's left front door had scrape marks... Jonas... - I know that the police deny this. But I just got the door back from a German technician - and he says the marks were most likely caused by a car- at a minimum of 60 km/h. I talked to an insurance technician, and... How do we get about this? Hammel and the board really appreciate your interest. And there are no doubts regarding your will and your talent. But I cannot offer you the job. Our clients are of the most varied description. Including that of Claes Kiehlert's. And I don't think you're ready for that right now. But I'm fine... As yourpartner I'd be uneasy as to your objectivity. As your godfather... - I'm fine. Really. As your godfather I think you ought to see somebody. Hello. Hello. Sorry, but I have to check this. Martin called. Are you okay? - Yes. How could you apply without talking to me? Could we take it later? I really have to... I don't know... What's your problem? What's my problem? - I can't... Jesus Christ, honey. I'll go jogging. Yes, make a run for it. Do you understand any thing? I understand that we haven't talked for a year. I understand you stay up half the night and go jogging in the fucking forest. I understand we never see each other, because you slave like a pig... Yes, I slave to make this... What? It's got nothing do with the job, you know that! What did you say to Martin? What is it you think that you can find in there? Hey, what's up? Are you going? Hey, Jonas! Easy now. You don't want me to drink this on my own, right? Not today. - Look at this! You need to drink it away. I know what it feels like. Listen... If you're getting married... wrong... When you marry, do it properly. Not all that town-hall crap, you know. Show consideration for the details. And what you may not know is that it's been a whole year now - since you proposed, and that's the maximum before marrying her. If I were you I'd hoist up my balls. You've scored more than you deserve. Be happy that she's still waiting. - Shut up! Shut up yourself... Look! Hi there! Come here... Come, come. They're coming over. - I can't be bothered. Oh, yes, they're coming. - Stop it. Get a grip formy sake, man! - Aren't I getting married? Not tonight. You need a shave, you're unemployed. You don't have a chance. Hi. - Hi. Sit down. - Wanna dance? Do I wanna dance? I'd love to. Hi. Hi. I'm Louise. I have a girlfriend. - How nice. I'm Louise. I'm Jonas. - Hi, Jonas. Hi, Louise. Can I buy you a drink, Jonas? Louise? I have to get going... Louise? Louise? Housekeeping! - Come back later! Marius, come here! Copenhagen Police. Hello? Hello, I'd like to report a... Yes? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hi, Jonas Bechmann. I'd like to file a complaint against a driver- who took me to Hornbaek last night. He went 180 km/h all the way. He never switched on the fare meter. He was in his forties... I'm Jonas Bechmann. I'd like to report my wallet stolen. The Imperial Cinema. Yes, I understand. At 9.15 p.m. Hello, I'd like to block my account. To block it, yes. Can you see, if anything has been withdrawn since yesterday? Hi. - Have you seen the new Spielberg? I could really do with a Coke... - Listen to me! The two of us went to the movies yesterday. We saw the new Spielberg. You wanted to party, but I'd had a row with Camilla and took a cab. I took a cab to Hornbaek. Are you listening? You saw me getting into the cab outside the cinema. This is your ticket. No! You didn't, did you? Did you screw the chick? She called last night. - Who? Camilla. What did you tell her? I said I didn't know where you had gone. 'Cause I didn't. I don't want to know anything! If you don't say anything, it neverhappened. What did you do last night? I saw a movie. What did you see? - The new Spielberg. About what? - Shut up. It's vital! - It's vital you get me a Coke. It's okay. Now, get lost. Hi. Where have you been? I slept at the summer house. I saw a film with Michael last night. You saw a film? Camilla? There's a package for you. Jonas? Hello. You can't park here. What? - It's a clearway. You can't park here. And don't forget the seat belt. Hello, Henrik Linde, please. Five million? Is that a problem? I have to ask you what the money is for. We've found a house in Amalfi, and the seller is a bit eccentric, so... That's why we do it like this. You know that's all your assets? - I know that, Henrik. Hello? What will happen now? What now? What now!? Where is it? What? - The money. Where is it? I just gave it... I just gave it to your... The guy with the dog. Who? Listen, I just paid him. He took the money and went that way. Stop! - He went that way a minute ago! Your girlfriend has the DVD now. - No! I just paid him. Come back tomorrow. Same time, same amount. But I can't... Or the DVD will be sent to the police. Listen... Hey! It's a bad idea. Really... You can't go in there! I couldn't... I'll call you back. Right... It's alright. What's happened? - I need to borrow some money. Of course. How much? - Five million. It's a lot of money, but I'll pay you back, of course. What's going on? - It's... Camilla... We've found a house in Amalfi. The seller wants the money now, and he wants cash. I'll tell you what I can do... I'll make some phone calls, and you'll have a 7-digit job within a week... I can promise you that. - No, that's irrelevant, thank you. I... we need the money now. I'll figure it out... Sorry to disturb you. Jonas? Martin tells me you're feeling bad. I'm fine. - It's a hard period. Remember that my door is always open. Cheerup, lad. Camilla? Camilla? Camilla! Jonas? - They're after me. The ones who killed Dad. - What? Come inside. They're trying to frame me for a murder. They want money. They shot a film, but it's not me in the film... Hi, Jonas. - Hi, Eva. Good to see you. - Same to you. Are you okay? And Camilla? - We're fine. Come and have some coffee. - Talk to you later. I just have to... What was your deal with Kiehlert? - What do you mean? My father lost the case, and they killed him. Why wasn't that enough? Why do they want me now? Some things you don't want to know. - Martin, stop it. Kiehlert was charged with the murder of a competitor. The murderweapon was a syringe, which was found in Kiehlert's car. But without the syringe, the DAhad no case. Three days before the conviction, the syringe disappeared mysteriously. Kiehlert was facing an acquittal. But then the syringe came back, just before the DA's plea. We found something, when we emptied your dad's office. Transactions. Normally your dad took notes of everything. Taped all conversations. But there was nothing on the Kiehlert case. I think your dad paid a policeman off and got the syringe. But then he had second thoughts and handed it over to the DA. Your father was a good man, Jonas. But he was put under pressure. How much? How much money was there in that account? Five million. Jonas Bechmann from Krogsboel and Partners. I have an appointment with my client at 10. What's the name of your client? - Claes Kiehlert. What do you want from me to stop this? What is it that you want? Who do you work for? You tell me something now! There was a deal to get me acquitted. The deal was not honoured. Then your father died. What do you want to know? - What can I do to stop this. People are like animals. When they are threatened, they react in one out of two ways. Eitherthey run fortheirlives, or they stop and fight. I bet you're a runner, Bechmann. So run. Yes? Take it easy now, pal. - No! There she is! There she is! No! - Don't move! Let me out. I want to talk to a lawyer. Let me out. Just take it easy, okay? My name is Jonas Bechmann. I'm a lawyer myself. You have not read my rights. Take these off, and let me call a lawyer. You'll get a lawyer, don't worry. Until then, take it easy. You called Camilla. Leave a message, and I'll call you back. All in all we have three scenarios: One about wills- one about joint ownership, and one about family responsibilities Good. That was all fortoday. Stay where you are! - Camilla... Camilla. - No... It's not me on that DVD. And the girl isn't dead. Who is she? She's nobody. - Why did she take you home then? She didn't. - Right... It was a hotel! Did you kill her? - She's not dead. I saw her yesterday. Then go to the police. - I can't. I have to find them. Find who, Jonas? - The ones who killed my dad. Now they're after me. They made the film to blackmail me. They're watching us. - Jonas. Don't go home! Go to the summer house. I'll pick you up in a couple of days. Look... Camilla? What was her name? The girl you danced with. Louise's friend? Who? - The girl you danced with. Relax! The police are looking for you. Michael, I have to talk to her. - Well, I definitely don't! Hey, you look terrible, man! What's going on? - Think! Did she mention her name? Hername is important! - I think her name was Sarah. Did she say where she works? In a clothes store. - Where? Come... - Are you crazy? I don't want to see her again... It's embarrassing. Do you realize what she wanted me to do? Hi. - Hi. What's up? - We're closed. Okay... Well, I just wanted a word with you. Right... It's not very convenient. - Nice evening the other day... Well, it wasn't really nice. What do you want? We're looking for your friend. I don't know where she is. - Have you got hernumber? No. You don't have her number? - You have to leave. Okay. Bye. - Bye. She's lying. - Who's the liar here? Come on. Let's go home. - Stop that! No, I don't want to. Wouldn't you be sorry, if you weren't invited to his birthday? Where is she? - I don't know. Mummy? - It's alright, we're only talking. Tell me where she is. - Listen, I don't know her. She came up to me in the bar and asked for a favour... What does she do? She's an escort girl. - Where? Elite Escort. Mummy? Come on, Freya. Let's go. Go, Freya. Good evening, and welcome. - Thank you. Thanks. Please... Stay put! My boyfriend is in the cloakroom. - No, he isn't. You came to meet a client, and that client is me. What do you want? - I want to know what's going on. Welcome. Would you like to start with champagne? Yes, please. Excuse me. The ladies' room? - This way, please. Tell me what happened! - I will! Let's go and sit down. You spiked my drink, didn't you? Didn't you!? Yes, with a rape drug. I was told to get you into the room, until you passed out. Here you go. Enjoy yourselves. They took your clothes off... And then they shot the film. Who are "they"? They booked me through the agency. I was to meet them outside the hotel yesterday, but they didn't show up. Now I have an address, where I can pick up the money, when... When what? When it's over. When will it be over? Get up! You can't imagine what they'll do. - I don't care. We're not going to the police. What's the address? - Please don't. The address! - Islands Brygge. Why didn't you just pay them? - I did. They'll kill her. She did what you told her. What are you talking about? - Just pay them. Camilla! Camilla! Camilla, don't worry. Drop it! The money. Where is it? In the car. The key is in the ignition. Camilla? Dig! Let her go. - Dig! Don't. Keep her out of this. I'm the one you want. Please don't... Leave her alone! No! No! POLICE POLICE Camilla... - She was worried and called me. She said you might be here. These were the ones who blackmailed me. I can help you out of this mess. But you have to let me handle it. Yes... Thanks a lot. The two cops... One year ago they worked in the evidence room. They did it. They gave the syringe to my Dad and expected it to disappear. And then it turned up in court. If my Dad had told about them, they would go to jail. Go home and get some sleep, Jonas. I'll take care of it tomorrow. Martin told me everything. They shot each other. Yes. No. I did it. I thought... I shot both of them. I did it. What do we do now? I'll go home and call Martin. Then I give myself up. Help me, for God's sake! I found them, Martin. In yourboathouse. It was all done foryou, Jonas. Otherwise you'd never have moved on. I just wanted to help you along. Your phone's ringing. Who was it? - Just someone from the office. When did you last get some sleep? Ayear ago. It's ringing again. I found it. You'd packed it away with the rest ofhis stuff. You've got his phone, and so what? You said it yourself. My Dad recorded all important conversations. Peterspeaking. I'm on my way in. - I found the syringe, Martin. - What did you find? The syringe that disappeared from the evidence room. That syringe, Martin. It's a bad connection. Stay where you are. I'm coming... How did it end up at your office? How the hell did you manage that? I'll make sure the DAgets it back. Then we'll see. And afterwards I report it all to the police. Do you understand what I'm saying, Martin? I couldn't find a parking lot. Are you ready? Hi, Martin. What do you want from me? The truth. He was going to take everything from me. My family... Kiehlert's people would have killed both of us, if I hadn't... So it was you. You were the driver of that car! You forced him off the road. And you left Louise in that hotel room. You cleaned up the place. You manipulated evidence. You devised alibis. You lied to Camilla and paid the money- instead of going to the police. Then came threats, assault and theft. Until you finally shot two men, because they would take everything from you. The two of us are the same. It was all a lie. - But the truth foryou. Yes... I forced him off the road. I had no choice. What was the idea? - You were too close to the truth. I had to think of something. If only you'd gone home as I'd told you. Then the people in the boat house had left, yourmoney had been found. And you would have been okay. I would have been okay? What do you want? If you wanted to shoot me, you'd have done it by now. If you wanted to report me, we'd have been at a police station. So what do you want, Jonas? You want to win like you always did. Your new office key. You're insane. - You work for yourself, not forme. You'll be a partner. You get the most prestigious defense counsel position in Copenhagen. Cases, connections, possibilities you won't even get close to elsewhere. Your five million will be in your account tomorrow. Or you could report me, and then what? I'll deny everything. The phone talk is only circumstantial evidence- of bribery that you'll never win in court. You have nothing. You can take it or leave it. Nothing will bring your fatherback. Sit down. Jorgen... I was worried about you, when I saw you last, but Martin told me - that it was all about some family affairs. You can say that. On behalf of the board I'm pleased to welcome you in our small family. The contract is on the desk. By the way, there's one more thing... Martin, I'd like to thank you for this... What do you want from me? The truth. He was going to take everything from me. My family... Kiehlert's people would have killed both of us, if I hadn't... So it was you. You were the driverof that car! You forced him off the road. Yes... I forced him off the road. I had no choice. You can leave yourkeys and ID-card on your desk. Jorgen... - You may keep the phone. I suggest you use it to contact your lawyer. Dansk Video Tekst
