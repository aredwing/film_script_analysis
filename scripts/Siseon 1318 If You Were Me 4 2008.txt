I think only one place I'd never want to go back... would be the school. Don't you think? We are 8th graders, and the midterm exam's over today. Korean Literature, 1st period. No, no! Don't get me mixed. She's the bottom ranked of our class, MA Jin-ju. I could be her... or her. I represent everybody, or nobody. I'm just a pathetic one who brings the class average down. I admit it. So students like us should be hot and attractive instead. Her? She's PARK Jin-ju. Academically, she stands first in the whole school. She's a bit cocky, but somewhat sweet, at least. So we don't usually screw her over. Pen down and hands up! Hands up! Hey, you! 5 more minutes please. That's all we ask for you. 5 more minutes please How come things I've studied are never on the test? Not a single question. I studied all night. Me too. Me too! I fell asleep. Me too. Me too! I am jealous of smart girls. They're good looking, too. They're good looking, too. Are they really smart? Or are they just lucky? Woo, Woo They are smart, and also lucky. No! What's good is money. Focus, guys. Focus! Yes, sir. That's my cell phone! Give me mine! Cellular Stations-We need a break! It's the report cards. Report cards. Report cards. It can make us unhappy and sometimes it can make us happy. Please don't let us go thru hard times. Please Don't let us, Please don't let us... Do Not Test Us! Please. As usual, the top in the class is.. And the last? MA Jin-ju! Your names are the same, but you're always at the bottom. Shame on you MA Jin-ju! Make your name worth! No, never. It's cool to have a name same as the top! Who knows? Someday, the world flips over. and I, MA Jin-ju may become PARK Jin-ju. PARK Jin-ju may become MA Jin-ju. Then what? It would be boring. Studying is boring. I'd rather be playing. My mom always says, What will you be? You're helpless, hopeless, I couldn't be more disappointed. But she doesn't know what my real dream is! My dream! My dream! My dream! My Dream! My dream! My Dream! Stop blowing the dust and sit down! The top ranked student in the school, once again, and also the jewel of the school, PARK Jin-ju got the first place! Congratulate her with applause! Don't be so happy. But don't act like you're not. I don't wanna be left out. I don't wanna be called stuck up. You don't really know. How much fear I carry all the time. Mom, my report card. - First place, again? - Yeah. I'm so happy. My little precious girl. She says it's all for my benefit. For my bright future, but... - Dad, my report card. - Report card? First place, again? Buy you something? I really don't know if they're telling me the truth. I've been always doing it. I feel like doing it. Don't be so happy. But don't act like you're not. I've been always doing it. I feel like doing it. x/2+1+y/3-2=-2 If you get it wrong, it takes too much time to go thru it again. It takes 40-50 minutes to interpret. So in order to do it right, conjunctions are really important... Have some snacks. You fool! Psycho, PARK Jin-ju! Get lost! Isn't it Jin-ju? Jin-ju! Jin-ju! Jin-ju! Wake up! Jin-ju! What's wrong? Are you okay? Did you feed yourself today? What's eating you the most lately? Nothing? Then why do you look so unhappy? What about studying? Isn't it tough? No, not at all. I love studying. The exam is near. I've gotta go study. No, no. You'll miss the test this time, okay? No way! I have to! I love studying. If I don't get the 1st place in the class... What happens... if you don't? Jin-ju... Let's ditch the exam this time. What did she say? Nothing... Jin-ju? PARK Jin-ju! Are you okay? I heard you've been in a hospice. What are you doing here? Are you going nuts, too? Ultra light plane! They're called micro light as well. One sheet weighs below 150 kg. Two sheets are below 225 kg. It reaches up to 150 knot. Isn't that amazing? That's my dream! I wanna fly, and the sky's no limit! May my dreams all come true! I wouldn't mind being a pilot or the boys in blue! Oh, my! You need a war to fly airplanes? No way! Peace is my motto. Every time I was down, I wished I was a bird. Every time I was out, I wished I was a butterfly. Far and far away over the ocean and the sky... Although, I'd get sore wings if I fly for too long. We don't need a flower. We don't need a nest. We don't need a flower. We don't need a nest. Even the cloud's on it's own. They meet. They greet. They part. And when they feel gloomy They become rain and fall. We don't need a flower. We don't need a nest. Although, I'd get sore wings if I fly for too long. If they get too sore, I can lean on a cloud. It might be a different day tomorrow. It might be a different world. Nobody knows. Nobody knows. They say that the farthest flying seagull sees the farthest. What about seagulls with poor vision? Give up seeing? Give up flying? Or does he have to kill himself? I heard they took all your books away. You can read it. I was diagnosed with ADHD, a concentration disorder. I have to take pills. Like that will make me the top student... If I see you cheating, you'll get an F. Now start. MA Jin-ju! Student number: 10323. Name: MA Jin-ju. My student number is 17! 17! I saw and heard everything. I was sitting right in the middle of PARK Jin-ju and MA Jin-ju. Although it was none of my business my heart was pounding fast. Hey! Mah and Park, come out! Right now! Nobody saw them cheating? Speak up! You both wanna get suspended? Hey, you! Is this what you learned from your parents? I know you did it. You, troublemaker! What happened? Did you see? Don't you worry, Mrs. Park. Thank you. I said be quiet! What did they say? Come On, Tell me! We neither going to be suspended nor be transferred to another school. We are still young. We are no kids. We're no adults. We're the mother of adults. We're the father of the mother. Let us know how warm the morning ray is. Give us the power to pull thru winter. Teach us how to embrace the spring. When the wind's strong, Push us off of a windy cliff, so we can learn how to fly. Main Cast NAM Ji-hyeon, JEONG Hwa-yeong Written and Directed by BANG Eun-jin Sejong Communications Translation Supervisor Yoon Yong A Nothing has been changed. Can schools ever change, after all? Since then, PARK Jin-ju's always been the top, although she ranked second or third a few times. Nobody knows what happened to MA Jin-ju. All of a sudden, she showed tremendous academic improvements. But soon, she stopped. It was too boring for her. She said she didn't wanna be in the exam hell. Anyways, we're all still studying. There goes the bell! I'm afraid of our cafeteria's lunch. Maybe the bean paste soup and only one side dish from it? I wanna go out play now instead of studying. What high school am I going to? I have to take the exam too. Anyway, you're entering to school through the weight lifting. I guess we can go in now. Let's go. Don't forget your vests! Move the goal post back! Push it harder! I'm fucking trying! Super So-yeong, Always count on you! Damn strong! She looks strong! You can make fun of her, but she's going to high school. I'm so envious of it! So-yeong Cheol-gu Thank you for all you've done. Don't mention it. Anyway, Cheol-gu is a bit shy. I wonder he'll be able to adjust. It can't be worse than here. When does the new semester start in Australia? The semester starts at the end of September, but we'll be there earlier... Kim, let's have lunch? Please go ahead without me. because of a language institute. His English still needs improvement. He is happy, right? You know he doesn't talk much. We're doing this for him. Maybe he knows it too. Are you going with him? Yes, but his dad is staying here. My sister lives in Melbourne. You must get through it. Hang in there, again! Stand it! You're doing very well. Excellent! Wanna drink? Why? Uh? The training's too much for you? It's all right... What are you gonna do after quitting it? Nothing. Did you talk to your parents? So-yeong, how are you gonna go to high school then? You've pulled through everything till now. If you give up now, everything will do down the toilet. - Sir. - What? Should I start figure skating? What? Or maybe... something like synchronized swimming? Oh, my goodness... Just tell me you would rather study. Don't waste your talent and strength. If you learn those types of sports, you should've started very young. You're too late now! So-yeong, Let's think it over after the competition of the next month. We don't have a choice because you are already on the list. I really need you! So-yeong! See you in the evening. The newly hatched baby turtles are heading toward the sea to grow up. Nobody has ever told them what to do. But the turtles smell the ocean and know that its their home through instincts. The ocean will train and raise the baby turtles. The turtles will grow up and come back to the same location 30 years later. This is gonna be a great opportunity for your travel make new friends... I hope... I can learn more English... I know your English is going to improve I really look forward to seeing all of your accomplishments and future OK then good luck Cheol-Ku Have fun in Australia. Thanks, Miss Norman Ki... Kiss me... You look like you've lost some weight. I haven't changed at all. Anyway, whatever you do, just do your best. If you do your best, you'll succeed. You just... What are you doing here? Madam, it's good to see you! You are having a late lunch. Is this your daughter? Yes, she's my youngest. She won a silver medal in the last provincial competition. She'll win a gold medal next year. Wow. That's great. Such a hard working girl. Excuse me! I'm getting off here. I'm getting off too! Hey! Hey! Can't you hear me? Sir! What are you doing? I'm watering the sea. Why? The sea is dry. Can you hold this? Let me go to the toilet. What are you doing? What? WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW! What? I said, What are you doing now? Something's wrong today. Something's wrong today. All of a sudden, everything became dull. I've got a big hole in my heart. I feel like I've been lifting weights ever since I was in my mom's womb. I feel like I have stuck in my throat with words can't be swallowed or said. Why did you follow me? I'm sorry about yelling at you. I thought you could understand me. I wanna stop doing something. But, I don't know what it is. Adults never take responsibility. They just wait for us to grow up. A few days later, I'll be in the other side of the sea. I'm different from you. I feel so trapped. I'm just taking it. RELAY Go in quickly! Hurry up, you guys! Hey, you! Come here! How dare you have lipstick on! Mr. G! There is a pervert over there! - You crazy bastard... - Pervert! Pervert! You are so dead! Come here! Stop right there! Wow, she's so pretty! Who do you think she takes after? Of course, it's me. Oh, my! So pretty... You scared me! Where is she? My little sweet heart, are you okay now? Let's hide her here for now. Kyu-ri, you have to move her later. Cha-seon, don't forget to give her some milk after the 3rd period. Okie dokie! Oh my dear... What are you taping now? Wanna know what it is? It's our secret! Well, to be honest... What's the matter with you? You've been never interested in us. No, no, no! Cha-seon! Where's the milk? I spilled it! What should we do? Aren't you taking a test? I am. - but you can go first. - What about you? I'll catch up, you go first. Ok. What was that? Go back to your seat. Next, Kim Hee-su. Is she absent? No, she's not. Can she do it later? No. Tell her she'll get an F. Who's next? Lee Cha-seon. Lee Cha-seon? Yes. You can start. Okay. Put out the cigarette! It's not your first time seeing me smoke? It's the warmest place in school. Feed her here. She's cute. You guys are so dead! You know, you better not smoke in school. What the heck are you doing here? What is this? What's that? This is your child, isn't she? I think she looks more like you. How dare you... Take your hands off! You little girl... You were just suspended from school. Do you even know what's gonna happen if you get into another trouble? Am I the baby's mother? Does it really matter at this point? I think you wouldn't have been caught if not making a fuss about the baby. Babies need milk every 2 hours and poop every 3 hours. There's nothing we can do about it. What if Hee-su gets suspended? I don't have any comment. Please don't tape of me. Kim Cheol-jung A Class Teacher From a biological perspective, Lee Tae-hee A Teacher of Biology adolescence is the most suitable time for pregnancy. But from an ethical perspective, Jeong Jae-hun A Moral Teacher a teenager getting pregnant is not appropriate. You're so beautiful. But where's your mommy? Where the hell is she? There are a lot of young single moms out there Lee Hee-jae A School Nurse and some of them want to keep their babies. I think adults have some responsibilities for those babies. Look, she's just so cute... Every classmates knew about it but kept their mouth shut. A baby at school? No way! If we can't find her mother, take her to the orphanage temporarily. Without her mom's permission? Is that OK? How about this? From a biological perspective, you should have a breast examination. A breast examination? For what? When a woman gives birth to a baby, she feeds her baby with... I disagree with the idea morally! Growing up in a carriage without parents... Kim Song-min A Teacher of History She's a legendary princess 'Bari'! In the view of the mythology, humans never gave birth to heroes. They hatched out of an egg or came from an ocean and so on... In short, they are so different and unique creatures... and also they go through enormous hardships and... Don't disturb my interview! I think doing more physical activities Kim Sam-du A Teacher of Physical Education is the best solution for them. More PE classes will reduce their sexual desire. Right? Our schools is the place for education. Bae Jeong-hyeon A Vice-Principal Anything that distracts students from studying shouldn't be tolerated. That's our responsibility and duty as an educator for their futures. Hee-su! How did it go? Are you okay? I can't... You are going to have a breast examination to find the baby's mom. It's ridiculous! Be quiet! Let's start from No.1. My breast size? 34. It's a bit large? Don't you respect us at all? Yeah, she's right! Let's calm down. - Don't be panic. - Shut up! If you don't go thru the examination, tell me who the mother is. We can't ever tell you that! Because we don't want adults to look down on her. We just started helping out the baby for fun. But it's different now. We're happy looking after the baby. We don't mind feeding her, changing her diapers, and taking care of her. When the baby smiles, I forget about my tiredness... I start to think about how much I appreciate my mother for raising me... The baby... doesn't have a mother. Are you sure? Miss, I... my stomach hurts! How? I don't know. My stomach is twisting! - You too? It hurts so much I feel like I'm dying! What's wrong with all of you? Food poisoning in this winter? This way, this way... If this were a movie, a man would just come out of nowhere and help us. What is her father doing? There is no trace at all for the baby's father. Hey, stop right there! You little chicks... Mr. G! Please! Hiding the baby away doesn't help you anything! Bring the baby back now! What the heck are you doing? Mr. G! Please don't come closer! I'm going to shoot it! What the heck are you doing? Put it down! We can't send her to an orphanage! You are now pissing me off! She's not going to there right now! We can take care of her on our own! It's not as easy as it may seem! All right, put it down first... We can take care of her for ourselves! Cut the crap! Put it down now... It's your baby... - Hee-su! - Are you OK? What are you guys doing here? Go back to the classroom now! Hurry up! Go back to your class! Do you guys really think it's okay to look after a baby at school? What gives you the right to send her to an orphanage? Why can't we bring a baby to school? Is it against the rules? This is a school, not a daycare center! Then what choice does a high school student with a baby have? Do I have to put her up for adoption and study? Or do I have to quit school and look after her? You shouldn't have had a baby in the first place! Or you should have used protection! What does age have to do with love? First, to raise a baby... We don't need all this talk, Bring your parents. We are not talking to you anymore. Don't cry, baby. She's hungry now... Don't cry, baby. Hyeon-ju! Hyae-yeong... I'll quit school. No! I wanna go to college too and also raise the baby. But I know that's impossible. I thought about putting her up for an adoption a lot. I even visited the institution, but I don't think I can do that. I just called my mom in Busan. Sir, I'm sorry. You shouldn't be! If she wants both at the same time, the school can't let her do that? That's right! I totally understand you guys but let's face the reality. Hye-yeong. I'm sorry, Sir. Please do her a big favor! Directed by YUN Seong-ho Be more energetic! No, like one in the 'Talk, Play, Love' UCC. Mom, My universe... is moaning... in pain. I can't hear... it's footsteps at all... Did you finish your assignment from the universe? No, mom. I'm the universe. THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF TEENAGE DRAMA Let's confirm everything at 9 am tomorrow. We stand out here for 30 minutes? No, 1 hour. I'm counting on you guys. Chapter 1 No good expressions of their emotions but tender hearts inside A girl died right over there. You dumbass. You are! Dumbass. A girl really died here. She just committed suicide. How do you know? Her boyfriend dumped her. Because of her pregnancy, she took pills and died. No kidding. My sister's the friend of her sister. Bullshit. Swear to God. Me too. I do swear to God. Me too. I swear to God. What the... Come on, swear to God. There goes your sister. Dumbass. That's you. Chapter 2 Psychological descriptions of independent schoolgirls and decent schoolboys' proposals Hey! Let's talk it out, talk... You didn't, why should I? I didn't hurt her on purpose. It was just a mistake! Mistake, my ass! Hey, stop it! You stay out of this. - Please. - Just go away! Okay... You're being more violent. You wanna die? A girl died right here. She really died here... She's not from this neighborhood, but was found dead here after drinking with some boys she met online. She fell asleep here and died. It was summer, but it got cold at night and she died. I'm gonna listen to music... It helps you writing essays on SAT... I've been taking care of Ha-yan, but I did it once. Stop bugging me. Only did it once? Yeah. You know what I'm talking about. You always do that with her... It's just sex! You pervert? If sex makes you a pervert, what about your parents? Don't bring my parents into this! I can be responsible for it. Give me a break! How can you do that? You're a just high school kid. So it's not okay for high schoolers, but it's alright for college students, even if they're incapable? That's bullshit. No kidding! I can be responsible for her. I bought clothes and shoes that Ha-yan is wearing right now. You know that. No, I don't. It's the same thing as studying. Nothing's gonna change if you go to college. make 1,000 dollars a month. You think you can make it with that kind of money? It costs me a several hundred dollars to take Ha-yan to her auditions. In addition to, you'll be responsible for rent and bills when you grow up,.. wouldn't be enough. I can make that much money! You also have to pay for your cell, with real estate prices rising. Shut up! Hey, it won't just be you, okay? We're gonna have babies. Didn't you hear about the dead girl? She used her lunch money and bought a cell phone. She got caught so she ran away and she was found dead right here. Hey, you really believe that? It's all lies. Did you see it? You know some girls do that... or not... No answer? No, look. Let's just go. Chapter 3 A dare conclusion: the conflict of a actual reality That's not a good way to treat a guy. Violence is wrong but sometimes you have to forgive it. And you know Ha-yan's boyfriend's blood type is AB. Sometimes, she takes advantage of him. I saw them in Myeong-Dong and her boyfriend was paying for everything. Students don't have money. If they break up, he's gonna suffer a lot. My mom and dad are both AB... Is your mom like that too? You know it's bad to hit somebody but sometimes you do it unintentionally. In some ways, it's an expression of love. You know my sister is very bright. She's really nice to me but sometimes she hits me. It's not that she hates me. I sometimes act crazy. One time, she asked what my dream is. I told her that I don't have any. Then she got upset and hit me. After getting hit couple of times, I discovered my dream. I have a dream. What is it? I want to be a police officer. A traffic cop? No. I'm going to police academy and I'll work for the government. The pay is good and it is secure. Plus, people never mess with government officials. Great. For instance, someone died here, but nobody knows about it. However, government officials know. The girl went to U.S. to learn English and came back to Korea. But her English wasn't any good. So, she tried to return to America, but her family went bankrupt. Her grades stayed low, and she committed suicide. You know what's funny? You know how she died? She held her breath until she died. That's different from what I heard. I'm pretty sure I'm right, because my sister knows a boyfriend of the dead girl. and he said that he overheard people talking in the bus. Then it must be true! Of course, totally! Are you a good student? - I'm better than you. - His grades were good. If I try, I would make good grades. I purposely am not making effort. Yeah, right. It'll be not enough going to any 4-year university. You should go to good one in Seoul. But you can't compete with those students in Gang-Nam. What do you like? What are you good at? - What? - You're good at beatbox! Let's say they grade you on beatboxing at school. Then students in Gang-Nam will go to the best private academies with foreigners to learn beatboxing. You can't compete with them. So it's a better idea to start early and make money. I play online games and gather items and you know how adults treat me? They respect me and ask me for items. Who are you? Are you the Little Match Girl or something? No, I'm the answer to the question, how can we make people aware of their enemy? While others suffer making a 1,000 dollars, I'll be making 800-900, get it? You're so realistic for a kid. Yes, I'm realistic. What's wrong with it? You acting like a teacher. I'm a teacher, you fool. It's funny how we are good friends. Why? When you were in junior high, you fooled around. Chapter 4 Riding on the bike with Pizza delivery boys... The sound sensibility of not mentioning social standing They weren't that bad. I hung out with them 'cause I was bored, but they were really nice. I'm not saying they were bad. You know I'm not realistic but I think they are even worse than me. That's right. Having fun is only for the moment, you'll never make anything of yourself. Right... By the way, I have a dream. What dream? Fashion design. - Design? - Yes. But in order to do that, you have to do well in school. When I said I'll study art, my friends laughed. They said I wouldn't make it. Are your grades okay? I did play around a lot, but I was still responsible. I used to study hard, you know. Out of 400, I was... It might be a good idea to go to a vocational high school... instead of going to an Arts school, to improve your grades. I don't think I'll study if I go to a vocational school, so... If you wanna study design, you at least have to go to Kukmin University. It's very hard to enter the college and graduate it. And then study abroad... It takes a lot of money... You know, I'm just... When I see people dressed, I wonder about what they're wearing. And think how they would look so much better with different outfit. And you need to be well-educated and have a wealthy family. Even the people with those things hardly make it. And tons of people start preparing from elementary school. My mom runs a clothing store in Dongdaemun. So, I can work in wholesale. I can go to a vocational college and study design... There are lots of talented kids, too. They come from everywhere. So, what I'm saying is that if you want to do it, just do it. But you have to go to college and go abroad and study... I think... It's not easy for you. Then I'll do it only to the extent that I can. See ya. Chapter 5 The liberal plot to approach their problem by talking Who do you want to vote for the president? Dumbass. Loser! I wanna vote for Lee In-jae Why? He looks like my father. You like your dad. Are you crazy? What about you? Heo Gyeong-yeong. He said everyone will get Stupid... who's gonna marry you? You're not smart, you're nothing. What about you? What do you have? Nothing. So, I won't get married. Girls don't mean anything to me. Dumbass. It's you. Chapter 6 The ending of encouraging their hopes and the climax of their concert I said no. - Please! - No way. You don't need a new cell phone. Mom, please. Think about your monthly expenses for extra lessons of English and mathematics and those Principle lessons. I don't have any money. I don't need lessons. Buy me a cell phone with the money. No, you need those lessons. I know everything already. Then tell me what you know about. It's nothing special. To succeed, you need strong will. Now that's principle, isn't it? So can you be in the top 5 of your class? Top 5? I'm preparing for foreign language high school. I can be in the top 3. Oh, well... Okay, I'll buy you new cell phone. Really? You better keep your promise. Alright, mom. Good. Now I have to go vote. Wanna come with me? No, I'm gonna stay in the car. Okay. Mom, who are you gonna vote? Who do you think I should? You tell me. Vote for Lee Myeong-bak. Lee Myeong-bak? Why? Because he's gonna win. It'll feel good later, if you vote for someone who get elected. You are such a smart girl. Okay, then! Mom, my space is moaning and I can't hear its footsteps at all. Did you finish your assignment from the universe? No, I'm the universe. Do you know you'll get a present from the market? No, I'm the present. Don't you wanna live your life with a prepared future? No, this moment is my life. A new language will liberate you from the world. No, I'm the language. You're here. It's cold. I voted for Lee Myeong-bak. Really? There weren't many people inside. Let's go home... Too many choices too short of a life Too much talks too little conversations Too many opportunities too little time Too many economies too little... Too many nations not enough people Too many rich too many poor Too many confessions, too little silences Too much silences too little promises Too many promises too little sincerities Too much sincerities too many same patterns Too many patterns too little thought Too much thoughts too little actions Too many choices too many short lives Too many tomorrows too little today A Film by KIM Tae-yong GIRL ON THE RUN Hey, Jang Cha-eun! Don't you attend a class? Do you ever study? Do I know you? It's me, Choi Yeongchan, your classmate! You're? Okay, then. Boo! Raise your knees! Jump! Jump! Jump... Right, watch your waist! Straighten your knees! Hold up your heads more! Bend your knees more! Seulgi? I'll transfer. You'll practice harder? Yes, sir. - And Mijeong? - Yes. Okay. Work hard. - Are you going too? - Yeah. - You have to do your best. - Okay. Good. What about you? I'm going to. Don't spend too much time with boys, okay? You have to practice harder. What about you, Cha-eun? Why aren't you answering? What? Dad, take a look at this. What is it? Our athletic team will be closed. So? Our coach is giving us an opportunity to transfer to Seoul. Why? He said I can be a good athlete with more training. So he asked me with him. Can I go? My friends are going too. Take this and go home. Okay. Good, now you ask me. it's too easy a question. Cha-eun? Mom. What's it? I've looked at it again and again, but I can't figure it out exactly. - What? - The words in red... Inflammables Do not dump Inflammables What does that mean? Don't throw away something. What kinds... of things? How should I know? You're the one to know that. What am I supposed to know? Why don't you know that? All mothers know things like that. And please don't pop into my room. Why? What comes after 27? Don't do that, all right? Hey, Jang Cha-eun! You're not running today. Minjeong told me that you're the best runner in our school. She talks about me a lot, doesn't she? She likes me a lot but she's not my type. Isn't it hard to run? No. I feel like I'm dying when I run. Do you know I'm taking Taekwondo lessons? Nope. You don't? I'll show you and look. I'm good at Taekwondo. Cool, huh? Not really. They say that this sea is going to become a huge piece of land. Can you believe it? No way, really? I'm serious.
