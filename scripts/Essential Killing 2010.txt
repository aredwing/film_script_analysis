What the hell? I put my trust in Allah, My Lord and your Lord! There is no living creature... but He holds it by its forelock; surely my Lord is on the right path. - Everyone got wasted? - A bottle per head! Look, 500's coming. Where did he get all this? Stamp him, I'll wrap up here. - Hey, you all take the north slope! - Right, boss. Fuck off... Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you. Allah knoweth, ye know not. - Don't chop it into matches. - Or toothpicks. Better watch your fingers, buddy. Are you crazy?! Hope you choke on it! Freak! Leave me alone! Stop it! Let go of it! Let those fight in the cause of Allah who sell the life of this world for the hereafter. And whoever fights in the cause of Allah whether he is slain or gets victory soon shall we grant him a mighty reward. Open the door! You won't get anything out of her. Mute as a stone. Good evening. Your husband home? We're looking for someone. He's armed and dangerous. - Should we try sign language? - I'm not making a fool of myself.
