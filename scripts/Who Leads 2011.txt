You're already in L.A. You never came back. I try to think about tomorrow. Does it hurt? You tell me. -Hey. -Hey. -I see you're all done upstairs. -Yeah. Off for the day. No way. -Jung? -You...you know this? I do know it. Self-help or school? Come on. Jung isn't exactly a recreational reading. Individuality, consciousness, the dissolving into the crowd. Yeah, yeah. Sounds like you're a fan. I am a fan. Self-help or school? Recreation. -So what are you drinking? -Pale Ale. Pale Ale? Ok. So... I know. This is gonna sound weird but, uh... What are your thoughts on dancing? -Are you ask...asking me to dance? -Well, it depends. Are you looking to dance? You're asking me. Yeah. I'm asking you. Is that a yes? "I would be a warrior." Do you always ask strangers to dance with you? Do you always lead? I'm Jordan. Spencer. "and you would be a thief" "but you would be a good thief" "and what kind of warrior would I be?" I'm afraid I'll forget. I feel like I've already lost. What is there to win? If you're always afraid, how will you live?
