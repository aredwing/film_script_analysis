So he said they want to come down and fight our gang, see, but they got a guy with his leg broke bad, and maybe he can't go 'round on account of poison. So I says for him to shut up because we got a guy with T.B., so that makes us even. Hey, that's you I was talkin' about. You. - Hi. - Hi, Spit. Kinda early, ain't it? Ain't too early for the old man to wash the booze out of his mouth. So I says we fight 'em anyway and Tommy's the leader, so he should come down and make up the fight with Tommy. Who says Tommy's the leader? Who says? We all says. Aw, you dog! What's the matter? I'll push you right in the river. Yeah? Try it. Don't be a wise guy. How many times do I have to tell you? Hey, look it. Get a load of that. - Hey, what's that? - It's the new kid moved on the block. Boy, we could fix him fine. - Yeah. - And how. - Hey, Dip. - Cut it out, will ya? How much longer shall we have to use this entrance? I'm sorry, sir. The other street will be repaired in a few days. Yes, but I can't even get my car through this street. No, sir. - Oh, it's all right. - It is not all right. Good morning, sir. That's what you see from the terrace. - Oh, they're sweet. - Yes, at a distance. Don't worry about it. They stuffed him like something dead. Hey, lady, does he smell? Hello. Hello, Phillip. How are you this morning? Oh, all right. In French, Phillip, in French. Yes, Mademoiselle. Tommy. It's gonna hurt the material. It's gonna be all worn out, washing and ironing it all the time. Drina, I don't need no shirt. What's the matter with this? I'm late. Late for what? For those no-good kids? For playing in the street all day? All right, so you'll be late... late for not working. Everybody's always asking what your sister's doing going on strike. They say... The next time those busybodies ask you what I'm striking for, you tell them it's for money that's coming to me for hard work. That $3.50 extra a week would get you out of these streets, for one thing. If you think any of us like walking up and down all day, carrying signs and worrying how we're going to eat the next day, you're crazy. And don't you go around being ashamed of what I do. All right. Okay. Something must be the matter with you. You get so mad... Good morning. Hot, isn't it? Gonna be a scorcher. - It came early this year, didn't it? - Certainly did. Drina, you were late last night. That's why Dave didn't wait. He didn't know whether you were coming home or not. I wasn't very late. Just a few minutes late. He used to wait for me. But now... She doesn't mean anything to him. It's just they started talking like one day. Why don't you speak to him, Drina? I couldn't do that. I haven't any right to. I wouldn't anyway. - Hey! - All right. Hiya, fellas. Hiya, Angel. Hiya, Tommy. Hey, that's the new kid moved on the block, ain't it? Yes. Hey, you! Yeah, you. Get up here. Hurry up. Come on, lift it around. We ain't got all day. Hey. You're new kid moved on the block, ain't you? Yeah. - What's your name? - Milton. - You wanna belong to this gang? - Yeah, sure. You got any dough? You gotta be initiated. - I got three cents. - Gimme it. Give it over. Don't hold out. Get it up. Get it up. - It's all you got? - Yeah. - Sure? - Honest. - Search him. - You don't have to. Shut up. If you wanna belong to this gang, you gotta have a quarter, see? A quarter? Where am I gonna get a quarter from? - From your old lady. - She wouldn't give me no quarter. Well, you know where she keeps her dough, don't you? Gimme back my three cents. I don't wanna hang out with you. Can it, will you, Moe? Gimme back my three cents! I want my money back. Come on. Come on, gimme back my three cents. - You want your three cents? - Yeah. Stop it! Get away! Get away! Stop it! Get out of here! What are you doing, watching life in the slums? Is it funny? Why didn't you stop them? Lady, you're scaring me. - Are you hurt? - They took my three cents! - Tommy! - I ain't got it. - You? - Not me. Don't look at me. - You? - I ain't got it. - Go on. Give it back to her, Spit. - Yeah. - Come on. Quick. - Shut up. I'll crack you. And I'll sock you where it won't do you so much... No dame gonna smack me first and get away with it. - Give her that dough. - What for? Give her that dough or I'll have to smack you. I can do my own fighting. I don't need your help. Come on. Give her that dough. Here. Come on. You look like a nice kid. Stay away from them. - They're no good. - Yes, ma'am. It was a good fight. Too bad it couldn't go to the finish. Tough kids. - You like? - Sure, what's it mean? He doesn't care what it means. He saw it on Park Avenue, so he thinks if he puts it up, he'll get trade from our rich neighbors. I ran up to your place last night, but you hadn't come home. Kay Burton and I went over to the park, listened to music. I wanted you to come along and meet her. I was late. Very late. Who are the choir boys? I don't know. That short one looks familiar. We had a strike meeting last night. I thought I told you. I was telling Kay about you, how when you was a kid I used to come home from school and tell you everything I'd learned that day. I was telling her what a swell girl you were and how hard you've worked. There. Picketing all day is hard on the shoes. The paper keeps 'em from wearing out. It may save the shoes, but it's hard on the feet. I'm complaining. When I think of the other people who are striking, most of them with big families. I've only got Tommy and me to worry about. What's the matter, Drina? Nothing. Nothing. Boy, ain't that something? You should've seen what used to be there. What for? I don't want to even see it now. I don't wanna hear you say it every minute. Nobody knows us, so shut up. - Hiya, Dave. - Hiya, T.B. Come on, Dippy. Let's see you dive in. Okay, okay, I'm goin'. Look at me, look at me. I'm divin'. A back-jack! Get someone to knock you in. I'm comin', I'm comin'. My head acts funny. Aw, get out and let me alone. I'll go in. Get out of here, will ya? - Hey, kid. - What? You got sense enough to run an errand? Sure, where? What are you doing? I'll go. 418, third floor, second door. Tell the old lady there a friend wants to see her. Okay. 418. Okay. I know you, don't I? No. - Why, you're... - He said no, didn't he? Why, you're Martin. Baby Face Martin. My name is Johnson, get it? Johnson. Sure. And my name is Dave Connell. Remember me? I used to be one of the gang of kids here... Johnson. Yeah. Yeah, sure. You weren't such a bad kid. Still good at keepin' your lips buttoned up? Depends on how good you are keeping your hands buttoned up. Don't worry. I ain't looking for trouble. What are you gonna do about him? Nothing. Nothing as long as he shuts up. And he'll shut up. Had your face fixed up? Yeah. Been readin' about me in the papers, huh? Go on over and try that address in Brooklyn, see if you can find her. And get something for your nerves while you're over there. Go on, beat it. I'm sending him over for Francey. Remember Francey? - Francey? - She was my girl when we was kids. Oh, yeah, I remember. Nice kid. Yeah, you bet. They don't make 'em no better than Francey, I know. You ain't seen her around here lately, have you? No. She moved away a long time ago. You're gettin' to be quite a headliner, huh? All over the newspapers. Should you be around here? I ain't here. I'm out West. I got kind of a yen to see my old lady and Francey. You know, I ain't seen my mother in ten years, not since the day I come out of reform school. You've come a long way since then. Killed eight men. What are you trying to do? Tell me off? No. I guess I'm just jealous 'cause you got away from here. Yeah, far away. What's your racket? Me? I'm an architect. Build houses. That is, I would if I could find any to build. You don't say. An architect? To build houses? You went to high school, huh? Yeah, and to college, too, for six years. I worked like a dog at anything I could to get enough... An architect. You was always smarter than the other slobs, Dave. Maybe it was worth it. You must be in the big dough now, huh? Yeah, it was well worth it. I've been painting for Pascagli. He's gonna give me twenty-five bucks. It's the first dough I've earned in a long time. Six years you work in a college and all you get out of it is hand-outs. That's a good one. I'm glad I ain't like you saps. Starving and freezing for what? Peanuts. I got mine. I took it. The fat of the land I'm living off of. Look. Silk. Twenty bucks. Custom-tailored. A hundred and fifty bucks. - And dames... - Ever get scared? Me? What of? You can't live forever. I don't know. Sometimes I get the jitters, and sometimes I get a terrific yen to stay put. But the eight guys won't let you. Quit talkin' about the eight guys or there's gonna be nine of 'em. You and I ain't gonna be friends anymore like we used to, hear me? I wanna see Francey. I wonder what she's doing. I bet she got married, huh? Nah. Maybe she died. Nah, not Francey. She had too much sense. Hey, fellas, look what's here! Hey, where'd ya get the suit? All fixed up fancy like a mutt. Maybe they're brothers. Hey, what are you, a boy or a girl? - He's a girl, can't you see? - I'm a man! You're a what? Wise guy, huh? Sure! I can name all the presidents of the United States, can you? So what? I bet the cream puff can't even swim. That's how much you know. We have a pool in there and an instructor, and I go in swimming every day. A pool in the house? Baloney. Let's see you swim. In there? It's dirty. - Dirty? - Dirty? Dirty. He says dirty. He says it's dirty. I'll sock 'em. What's that junk you got in your mouth like a horse? This? It's a brace to make my teeth straight. What? I could do that with one wallop. You just try. My uncle is Judge Griswald. Yeah? Did'ya ever hear of Judge Perkins? He's a friend of mine, see? He sent me to reform school once. Why don't ya come down here? You're afraid to? I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid of anything. All right, then, come on down if you're not afraid of anything. All right, I will. Yeah? Well. I think, and I think, and I think, and I can't remember the number. Then I remember the house, but then I forget the floor. But I try all the bells, but whatever she is, she ain't there. Huh? Nothin' for nothin', kid. That's a fine thing to do to a kid. A fine thing, a fine thing. My big brother was here, you wouldn't do that. Bang you on the head, that's what he'd do. Bust your nose and give you a blinker, that's what. Hey, Dippy. Hey, Sharpie, come here. All right. - Hey, hey, hey. - Watch it, boys. What's the matter here? It's those horrible children. I see them from above. Philip didn't want to wait for me, Mr. Griswald. Aw, shut up, you big bag o' wind. You try to hit him... Go get him the army and navy for a bodyguard. Next time, try hitting them back. They're your age. If they try to fight, fight back. Come here, guys. Here's how we're gonna get that lump of mush. Hey, fellas, watch. Hey, crumb, duck. Hey, lady. Has your kitchen stove got diamonds in it like that kid makes out? - No. - No. Hey, guys, let's grab a dip. - I don't feel like it. - Hey, what's that? - Oh, her? Friend of Dave's. - No. Yeah. Comes to see him all the time. Hey, wait for me, fellas, will ya? Good morning. Good morning. You're late. - I know. I meant to be. - Why? Oh, nothing. I don't like it when you're late. I wish we had somewhere else to meet. I had fun last night. I never knew there were so many places to go that didn't cost anything. I know 'em all. I always go to the smart places and have a dull time. But I had fun with you. I always have fun with you. Fun for the first time in years. Do you like him? Yes, I like him. I was pretty hard up when I met him, and tired of being hard up. He's been good to me. That's his boat, isn't it? It's a beauty. You know, when I was a kid, I used to make boats and sail them here on the river. Looks like it's getting ready to make a trip. - When? - I don't know. I don't know. You'll be going with him, won't you? Yes... No, I don't know. He wants me to go. He wants to marry me now. But I'm not in love with him. I haven't even told him I was. But I'm frightened of being poor again. I hate what it does to people. I saw what it did to my family and to me. Yes, I don't blame you. It's something to be scared of. But... Look, Kay, I'm to phone Del Block this afternoon. That's Carter and Block. I've been trying to get a job with them for a long while. I left some of my drawings there, and they liked them. Well, two of their draftsmen are going on a vacation. There might be something. It wouldn't pay very much, but... Why am I talking like this? I'm sorry you're going away. I haven't thought about the trip much. I kept pushing it off because... well, I suppose because of you. We've never talked about ourselves before, but I've thought about us a lot. Haven't you? I've tried not to. - Car's waiting, Miss Burton. - Yes. All right. Will you know about the job today? Yes. I think so. Yes. Maybe this afternoon. - Will you wait for me? - Yes. One, two, three. You want some more, you little rascal? I'll fix your wagon. Hey. What? Look, if you want, I can snitch that quarter for you. Okay, kid. That'll put you in the gang. - What's your name? - Milton. Anybody gets funny with Milt gets funny with me, see. Come on, kid, see what you can do. Okay, Tommy, okay. See, he's a good kid. He learns fast. Remember the time I moved around here? I was wearin' white socks and wouldn't curse. You guys thought I was a sissy. - Except me, Tommy. - Yeah, except you. Everybody else I had to beat the pants off of first. Yep, fellas. It all comes from learning. Give me three and make 'em good. - I'll take two. - Five. For years we been telling him he can't take five. Five he keeps sayin'. - Four. - You can only take three. Gimme one. I'm takin' two. - Hiya, guys. - Hiya, Tommy. - Whatcha playin' for? - We're just owin' today. Deal me in the next hand, huh? - Okay, Ange, what do you do? - I blow. - Blow me. - What do you guys want? - Get the... - Get out. Go on. Get outta here. That crazy brother o' mine. Anybody see the rich kid? Don't worry, we been on the lookout for him. Hey, T.B., feel that bump. Just feel it. - Me old man give it to me. - For what? For nothin'. Just like that. For nothin'. - So he comes in drunk. - Hey. - You're not coming up? - Jean, I can't. You can't, you can't. You mean you don't want to. That's what you mean, isn't it? Isn't it? Yes. That's what I do mean. Yeah, lady. I guess he ain't comin' up. Hey, Blondie, wouldn't I do instead? Go stick your head in a spittoon. So like I was tellin' you. So he comes in sopping, so he coulda been sponged. And he starts beating me old lady. - What's so funny about that? - So nothing's funny... ...'cause then he picks up a chair to wallop me with. What'd you do then? So I grabs a kitchen knife. That big. And I says, "Touch me, you rat, and I give you this. " Yeah, so what's he do? So he falls on the floor and goes to sleep and snores. Like that. Right on the floor he goes to sleep. You find Francey? Well, where is she? She ain't comin' over right away because you said not to give her your name, so she's comin' over when she gets out of bed. 'Course, she don't know it's you. She seemed kinda busy, your Francey. - What're you talkin' about, clown? - Nothin'. Hey, who's the leader of this gang? - Me. Who wants to know? - We're from up the block. - Yeah? Well, fly back there. - You tell him. - You wanna fight our gang? - Okay. - Okay, fellas? - Sure. - Certainly. - Saturday, four o'clock? - Okay. Saturday, four o'clock. - Okay. No bottles or rocks, just bare knucks and sticks. - Flat sticks. No bats, okay? - Okay. Hey, come on back here a second. - Look, fellas. - Take it easy, Moe. The mark of the squealer. Good one, too. Go on, beat it. Beat it, wise guy. Shine, mister? Okay. - What's the mark? - Don't you know nothing? The mark of the squealer. It's what you get when you squeal. Just keep it in mind. Yeah. Just keep it in mind. - So your fight's at four o'clock. - Yeah. Yes, sir. We'll be there right on the minute. That's the wrong way. Get there early, earlier than you said. Then they won't be ready for ya. - Yeah? - Yeah. And get yourself some old electric bulbs and throw 'em. Then you throw a couple of milk bottles, see? When some of the other kids get hurt, then you charge 'em, but not before, see? Can't. We made up no milk bottles, only bare knucks and sticks. You made up. Listen, kid, when you fight, the idea is to win. It don't matter how. And in gang fightin', you take out the tough guys first. A stocking full of sand and rocks is good for that. And if that don't work, a knife will. No knives. Gee, that ain't fair 'cause we... Ain't fair, huh? Fancy talk. Suppose some other kid pulls a knife on you? Then I pulls one on him. Like... Lend me. Like this. - Like this. - Come on. Quit it. See that? Pot shot! Boy, what a pip! I know. You flick. - You do it this way. - Tommy, put that knife down. - Pretty good, huh? - Teaching him tricks, are you? You were always good at that. Mind your business. I mean it. I don't like you around here, so don't stay too long. See your old lady and get out quick. Hey, you got a visitor. Your swell girl. She just went in looking for you. - What are you talking about? - Talkin' about your girl. She just went in looking for you, I guess. She sure wasn't lookin' for me. Quit it. Quit it, can't you? That coughing's driving me crazy. All day and all night. All the time it goes. - Where you goin' now? - Where do you think? To earn some dough so I can pay the rent to hear you cough. Well, do you think you'll know me now that you've seen me? Excuse me, lady. That's twice in a row. You're a dog. - How do you do it? - Boy! Hey, look, I've got a hair. - Baby, that's some hair. - Oh, that's a beauty. - Akeys akeys haffies? - What for? Come on, I said akeys. I said haffies. What for? I won 'em, but before I won 'em I lent 'em to T.B. so he could play. Come on, haffies or I'll kick you in the slats. Hey, Tommy, do I gotta give him? Nah. He didn't have his fingers crossed. - I'll choose you. - You think I'm some dope? Yeah. A dope what smells on ice. Stand up to him, Milty. Stand up to him. What's the matter? You want to fight? - Yeah! - You do? - Yeah. - Well, join the army. You crumb. Atta boy, Milty. - Hey, Angel. - What? I'll swap you something for the knife. - You ain't got nothin' to swap. - Well, loan it to me. No, I need it. Honest, I need it. Look, Angel, I'll give you eleven cents for it. Sure. It only cost ten. I don't care. Here, Tommy. - You mean you're giving it to me? - Yeah. You can keep it. Gee, thanks, Milty. That's swell. Thanks. - That's nothing. - Thanks a lot. I'll wait here. Well, go on. Boy, oh boy, oh boy. Gee, that's a nice watch you got there. What time is it? A minute and a quarter past half past four. T.B. I got T.B. Come on, fellas, I got something great to show you. Okay, okay. - You wanna come see? - No, he can't see. Why not? He's a good kid. This is only for the gang. Only for the gang. What is it? Gee, I can't tell you, but, boy, it's something great. - Will you get the lead outta your pants? - Hurry up. Too bad they won't let you see it. Boy, you never saw anything like that before. - I don't care anyhow. - It'll only take you a minute. Hey, fellas, let him come and see, will you? He's okay, no kiddin'. - Well, all right. Let him come. - Come on. - Come on. - Well, I don't know. - All right. - Wait, wait. I'm coming. I've got a club here. Mom. Mom. How are you, Mom? It's me. It's me. I only had my face fixed. You no-good tramp. Mom, ain't you glad to see me? That's how glad I am. You dog. You dirty yellow dog, you. Mom, what kind of talk is that? Don't call me Mom. You ain't no son of mine. What do you want from me now? Nothin'. Then get out of here... before I crack your face again! Get out of here. I killed a guy for lookin' at me the way you are now. Yeah... you're a killer all right. You're a murderer. You're a butcher, sure. Why don't you leave me forget you? Ain't I got troubles enough with the cops and newspapers bothering me? And Johnny and Martha. What's the matter with them? None of your business. Just leave us alone. You never brought nothing but trouble. Just stay away and leave us alone and die. But leave us alone. - Two gins. Double. - Okay. Turn that thing off. Turn it off quick! - Chaser? - Yeah. Piece of sausage for me and water for him. I thought a little noise might make you feel better. Funny how some people don't like music. I come all the way across the country. I must've been soft in the head, so help me. And what do you get for coming all the way across the country? A crack in the face. I don't know. My old lady ain't like that. When I come home, there's something to eat, something to drink, she wants a little money. It's always, "Hello, how are you?" Shut up. I must have been crazy in the head. I must have been nuts. She just ain't got any heart. Shoulda slugged her one. You shoulda... Buy yourself another one someplace else. Go on. - That's a beaut. - Maybe we better beat it. Not me. I'm going in for a dip. What's the matter with you? Scared? Come on, fellas, let's go. How do you do? How do you do? No way. Get outta here. - Hello, Drina. - Hello, Tommy. - What's gonna be for supper? - Stew. And lucky to have it. Maybe I could buy us something nice. - Maybe I could buy us a soda. - What with? What have you been up to? Nothin'. Nothin'. I been up to nothing. I was just thinking how hot you looked, and a soda... - Hi, Dave. - Hi. Don't think out loud. I'm here. Hello, Drina. You're home early. Any news? Maybe good news. Today the boss said our committee should come in and talk things over. And maybe, just maybe... That raise would mean a lot. I could get him away from here. Far enough away? I don't know. I can only try. You'll be all right. You'll always be all right. I'll be all right. Drina will be all right. Drina was good to her mother. Drina's good to her brother. Drina works hard. Drina works, and cooks, and cleans, and goes to bed to get enough sleep to get up the next day and work. I've heard that ever since I was ten years old. I'm tired of hearing it. Don't say it again. You want something for yourself now. That's right. Maybe I'll go away. I mean far away. You see, I know a man. He's very rich and he likes me. I met him in the subway. He's very good-looking. It was so hot and crowded. When I got out, I was dizzy and he took my arm, and apologized, of course, for speaking to me like that. He brought me a glass of water, and we started talking. He looked so clean. You know, like they always do. Well, I knew it wasn't right, but I didn't care. And he took me to dinner. The kind of dinner where you can order anything you like. He's very, very rich. He's got a house in New York and a wonderful house in the country. I like that one best because it looks like a Christmas card with chickens and snow. He likes me very, very much. Do you like him? I don't know. I made it all up. Not now. Years ago, when I was a kid. I know that house in the country so well, I could almost build it. He'd be young and very kind. I wish I could buy you those things. I even wish I could find him for you. Do you? Hey, Pascagli, what's-a matter? You no like-a de water? Stop crying, Philip. Nothing's going to happen to you now. Where are they? You told me he'd gone to the garage with James. It's your business to know where he is. But always he goes to the garage. Always to the garage. There they are! They're the ones. He's the one. He's the leader. Why did you beat this boy? What did you do it for? Hey, fellas! Don't let him go, Daddy. He's got my watch. Don't stand there. Call the police. I ain't got the watch, but I'll get it for you. Honest. Mister, don't call the cops. I won't touch him again. We do it to all the kids and they do it to us. That ain't nothin'. - You're breaking my arm. - Here you are. Here you are. Here's the watch. Let him go, mister. Put the watch down there and get away from here. Let him go. What are you doing to him? Let him go. You're hurting him. You know this boy? No, I'd never seen her before. Mind your business, lady. - What's going on here? - Where is that policeman? Lemme go, lemme go, I tell you. Lemme go. - Come here, will you? - What happened, Mr. Griswald? Never mind. Take my handkerchief and wrap it around. Let him get away. Don't do anything now. All right, all right. What's the matter here? - Just an accident. - I wouldn't call it an accident. One of these hoodlums on the block here cut me. I want you to find the boy and arrest him. I'm so sorry you were hurt, but he didn't mean It. Well, what's the boy's name? I don't know. Ask this girl. She seems to know him. I don't know him. I never saw him before. But I live around here and I know these kids are wild, but they don't mean any harm, really they don't. If they don't mean any harm, a beating, a theft, and a stabbing are pretty good all in one day. You call that meaning no harm? Call Dr. Merriam and ask him to come over immediately. What does the boy look like? Thin and dark and... oh, I don't know what he looked like. Shouldn't be hard for you to find him. No? Thin and dark, huh? How many like that do you think there are? I want that boy caught and arrested. - What good will that do? - It will do this much good. It'll get the little gangster before he can do more harm than this. But he can be punished some other way. I'll see to it. I mean I'll speak to his mother. Find out where he lives and arrest that boy. Do you understand? And let me know when you've found him. Well... and who does that guy think he is? Judge Griswald's brother. That's all. Just Judge Griswald's brother. Well, what's the kid's name? Where does he live? - I don't know. - You said before you knew his mother. And if I did, I wouldn't tell you. That's the trouble with all you people around here. You're cop-haters. A cop asks you something polite, and right away you're ready to kill him. Yeah? See this? We were picketing the store today and one of you dirty cops hit me. - What's that? - I said one of you dirty cops hit me. - You were picketing, weren't you? - We got a right to picket. They hit us right and left. Three of the girls were hurt bad. - Yeah, I'd tell you anything. - Aw, go on. Go on and beat it. Hey, you. Do you know who this kid was? Sure. He was my father. Why didn't I learn a trade? I don't know who he was. I don't think he was anybody from this block. What's the matter? Having a little trouble? It don't pay to be nice around here. Fine job for a grown man. Looking for a punk kid because he gave an old man a pin scratch. He's fit to be tied. He's got a brother that's a judge. He could break me. First thing you know, I'll be pounding a beat in Harlem. This is a tough enough precinct, but Harlem... Pal of mine got killed there. Of course, you know what they always say. The quickest way to get killed is to kill a cop. Yeah, that's what they always say. Yeah, but I'd rather not be the one that gets killed just so they can kill someone else, see my point? Well, there ain't no profit in chasing kids. I bet you'd like to get your hands on one of the big boys with the rewards on 'em? Who wouldn't? Yes, sir, who wouldn't? I'd buy myself a soft drink stand on the Merrick Road. Nothing around here but making old hags take in the garbage. Why didn't you go on home to dinner with him? Doc did a pretty good job. Jimmy, come on up. Supper is ready. Come on. Ain't we ever gonna eat anymore? You know, there must be something in it. I mean to have a place to go to. You sit in the same place every night. It's your own chair. Not me. I'll take mine in a dump with music, where you can have anything you want you can pay for. You can have one thing one night, something else the next. I'm gettin' sick of what I can pay for. I can remember different. You've changed more than your face, all right. So you're gettin' ready for a little woman and some kids, huh? I got enough dough. Well, I always say, every sucker for what he wants. That Francey. That girl you want to see. Why do you have to bother with that cheap little... Cheap little what? Maybe I'm wrong. We all make mistakes, boss. That's why they put rubber on the ends of pencils. Well, who's the important guy wants to see me? Come on, come on. I'm busy. Francey? How do you know my name? Who are you? Well, for the love of... Marty. Yeah. How are you, Marty? You did something to your face. Yeah. Plastic, they called it. They said you were out around Colorado, the newspapers. Yeah. Gee, I'm glad to see you. - No. Don't. - What's the matter? - I ain't good enough for you? - No, it ain't that. You know, Francey, I never forgot you. Go on, you with all your fancy dames. Where do I come off? - They don't mean nothing. - That chorus girl. What's her name? Nothin'. She ain't got nothin'. None of 'em have. Remember that night on the roof? Yeah, I remember. The sky was full of stars and I was full of dreamy ideas. Yeah. Me too. A couple of crazy kids, we were. We were gonna get married. I bought a ring at the five-and-dime store. Only we didn't have money enough to buy the license, remember? Gee, it seems like yesterday. We were talkin' about it right here. Yesterday? Seems like a million years. Listen. You got to take care of yourself. What are you doing here, anyway? You got to get away. I don't want 'em to get you. What difference does it make where I go? They got their finger on me everywhere. They won't recognize you. Even I didn't. Yeah, but you can't change these. Three times I burned them with acid and things. It's no good. But I'm getting out of here. I come back for you. - I wouldn't be good for you. - I'll worry about that. It's a dream. I'm having a dream. What I wanted for so long. I'm tired. I'm sick. Can't you see it? Look at me good. You've been lookin' at me like I used to be. Why didn't you get a job? They don't grow on trees. - Why didn't you starve first? - Why didn't you? Well, what did ya expect? I don't know. Here. It's hot. Be careful where you spend it. And keep your lips buttoned up. I wouldn't tell on you, Marty. Not if they tied me to wild horses, I wouldn't. Honey, could you spare another twenty bucks? - I got to... - No! Okay, Marty, forget it. I was just... All right, all right. Beat it. For old times' sake, will you do me a favor? Please. Will you kiss me here? Just for old times' sake? Thanks. I know. Two double gins. Sausage for you and water for you, right? Yeah. Chez Pascagli never forgets an order and never forgets a face. I know what you feel. Anybody would. Twice in one day. Yeah. Twice in one day. I told you we shouldn't have come back. But you wouldn't listen to me. You never listen to me. Never go back. Always go forward. - Shut up. - I read that. You know where? When I was a kid. My old lady bought it in a store... a sign, I mean... and hung it over the bed. I've always kept it in mind. What do you say we go back to St. Louis, huh? That Dawn La Gatta. I bet she's waiting for you. She was all right. Regular. And as respectable as a whistle. I mean in the right way. I betcha there's "welcome" on the doormat for you there. All right. All right. Forget about the dames. But twice in one day. And that's what I come back for. That's what I take a chance for. I get this. What I been thinking about all these years... Aw, forget it. Listen, Marty. You come back here for a reason. And I came with you. Because where you go, I go. Let's get out of here tonight. Too many people know you here. Tonight, huh? What do you say? You see what they did to that rich kid today? They took him down in that old warehouse. Well, there's no reason he can't be taken further away. No, no. We're too hot. Kidnappin' ain't in our line. I come home for something. I didn't get it. But I'm coming out with something, even if it's only dough. - Oh, no, Marty... - Shut up. Go out and get Whitey. Find out what he knows about that rich dump. Go ahead, Hunk. Get going. Not a sign of Tommy anywhere. Yeah, I know. I've been all over. Don't worry, Drina. He knows his way around. He can take care of himself. He can take care of himself too well. How could he have done such a thing? Where does he learn about knives and... He had an expert teacher. Anyway, it's not hard to learn in a place like this. But, he's not a bad kid. Not really bad. He never has been. The famous Baby Face Martin used to live on this block. He wasn't such a bad kid either, at first. He was smart and brave and decent, at first. Like Tommy, you mean. Ever since he was a little kid, I've tried to teach him what's right. I don't know what else to do. I've tried to bring him up decent. What chance have they got against all this? They've got to fight for a place to play, fight for a little extra something to eat, fight for everything. They get used to fighting. Enemies of society, it says in the papers. Why not? What have they got to be so friendly about? It didn't do those things to you. Didn't it? Well, it did enough to me, the other way. It made them accept it and get tough about it. It made me into a fool. I spent my life dreaming about tearing these places down. Well, I found out today. I saw myself and these rotten holes we live in through somebody else's eyes. I wanted to tear them down with my fingers. Yeah, you always talked about that... how you were going to tear all this down and all the other places like them. How you were going to build a decent world where people could live decent and be decent. But now you want them down just so she won't see them 'cause they're not pretty for her to see. All it means to you now is whether or not you get her. Well, go on and get her. And forget all this. And if you can forget, it's all you were ever good for in the first place! Tommy. Tommy. It's all right. I got to beat it soon, Drina. I can't hang around. - What did you do it for, Tommy? - I didn't mean to hurt him that way. He was twistin' my arm and callin' the cops. But a knife. They'll send you to jail. Yeah. They gotta catch me first. - Got to run away, Drina. - Where are you gonna run to? I have plenty of places to hitch to. Lots of guys do. Don't talk so crazy. What are you going to eat? Where you going to sleep? How are you going to get along? You're just a kid. I'll get along some way. I don't know. - Let me alone. - I won't let you alone. Did momma work her life away just so you should be a tramp? Is that what I've worked for ever since I was a kid? - That's fine. - All right, it's fine. What do you want me to do? I'll go to that man and tell him about us. - Maybe he'll be nice and... - You know that won't do any good. They'll lock me up till I'm 21. That'll be fine, too. No. I won't let that happen. I won't let 'em touch you. I'm going with you. We'll get out of here. - We'll go someplace together. - No, you can't do that. You're a girl. - I gotta go soon, Drina. - No. They don't even know your name. You're better off here. Somebody could see you in the street. Listen, Tommy, I'm going with you. We'll get along all right. I'll get work someplace. Maybe in the country. You just be quiet. I'll get some things ready. We'll wait 'til the street's empty and nobody'll see you. We've had trouble before. But it's been the two of us. That's the way it's always going to be. I got nothing to stay here for now. Nothing at all. Drina. Drina. Drin... What do you think? Maybe. What do you mean maybe? I want to know. Two apartments on the same floor. Not so good. But I think the back elevator's got a private hall leading to the Griswald place. What about the guy in the elevator? He won't be in the elevator. When do you want it? - Tonight. - Tonight? Okay. Give me a couple of hours. - Big enough dough? - Plenty. Shut up. I thought I told you to get out of here. You've made trouble enough. Now get out of here and get out quick. Take your friend with you. All right. That was your chance. If you don't want it, the cops will. I think they're going to like to know you're in New York. Hot, ain't it? Hey, you ain't seen that kid around anyplace, have you? Old Man Griswald's gonna have quintuplets if he ain't found. You'd think if they didn't have to work, they'd sit quiet and have a nice beer. - Look at "em. - Yeah. I gotta get my summer khaki out pretty soon. It's gettin' too hot for this. Get back. Get back. I'm going out. - Who is this guy? - I don't know. Say, Old Lady Martin. That's the guy. Baby Face. Sure. No, that's not him. Can't be. I was talking to this one a few minutes ago. Oh, so you were talkin' to Baby Face Martin, were you? A few minutes ago, huh? Sure, we were talkin' along just as nice as... Well, you'd better keep it a secret, you dope. - Gee this guy... - Hey, Peters is hurt bad. I'll get an ambulance. Get out of here. Gangway. You'd better go up and get her. We need her for identification. Say, where's the guy that did this? - Yeah, who is he? Where'd he go? - He's up on the roof here. Box 5027. Mulligan. Send an ambulance. Make all notifications... Baby Face Martin was just shot. Get back! This ain't no circus. Come on, break this up here. Keep this clear. Come on, get back there! Harry. Harry, I'm gonna pick up this guy around the corner. All right. Say, that was a nice haul, kid. Are you hurt bad? Hey, do you know who your friend was? That's the famous Baby Face Martin. You know there's a nice $4,800 in reward money up for him? They pay you for it, huh? Sure they pay you for it. Come on, open it up. Open it up. Gangway. - What's up? - We just got Baby Face Martin. Hey, Doc, right here. Oh, "we" just got Baby Face Martin, huh? Get up to the hospital, quick. Hey, Doc, take a look at him, will ya? You're lucky. I don't think it's bad, but go on up to the hospital and have it cleaned. - I'm all right. - Well, come on. Hey, take our hero up to the hospital and have him fixed up right away. Come on, kid. And, say, have him cleaned up nice and pretty so he can spend the reward money. All right, open up there. Come on, step back, folks. Open up. Come on, get back there. Open up. Come on, step back, please. - Open it up. - Hey, buddy, turn around. One side. Come on, open up. All right, keep it clear. Gangway. Keep this lane open. All right, open up. Certainly did a good job here. Not enough left for a good post-mortem. 106, 35th Precinct. You got his pedigree? Sure, he knows all about him. He used to talk to him, too. Joe Martin, 31, white, U.S. Five feet, eleven inches. 150 pounds. Unmarried. Occupation... All right. Dr. Flynn. Mark him DOA. - Right. Dead on arrival. - Hello, Doctor. So somebody finally got Martin. It's about time. Gang murder? Seems to have been a local fight. Yeah, local boy makes good. - What have you got on him? - Twelve gunshot wounds. Five stomach, four chest, three head. Diamond ring. Look at that rock. Look out a minute. What a pile. You count it. Send him down to the morgue. I'll look him over in the morning. And, Morgan, you see me there, too. Yes, sir. Come on. All right, bring it in. Come on, keep this lane open. Come on, open up there. Hey, Mulligan, come here. That's one of them kids, one of the gang. What kid? What are you talkin' about? - The one that stabbed Mr. Griswald. - What? Oh, where? - In the window there. - Are you sure? Certainly. I'd swear to it. Hey, let me go! Hey, let me alone! Let me go, will ya? I didn't do nothin'! Let me go! Let me alone! - What's this kid got to do with it? - That's something else. Let me go, will ya? You're one of the gang that beat up a boy and stabbed his father, ain't ya? No, I ain't. I didn't have nothin' to do with it. It was a kid by the name of Tommy Gordon. Tommy Gordon? Where does he live? Come on, where does he live? Pick up a Tommy Gordon for me, will ya? Number 440. He's wanted for stabbing some guy. I gotta wait here. Hey, you, don't go too far away. - Hey, Drina, where's Tommy? - I don't know. Why? The cops are coming. Somebody told 'em it was Tommy. They're coming here. I just heard 'em. Tommy, it's me. Let me in. They know your name. They know you did it. What? They couldn't see me from the window. I was watching, sure, but they couldn't see me. No, Milty said somebody told the cops. - Who told 'em? - You gotta get out of here. What chance have we got if they catch you? - I'll be all right. They won't get me. - All right. You hide someplace. I'll be looking in the street downstairs for you. We're going together, do you hear? Do you hear me, Tommy? We're going together. All right. Hey, where's the party called Gordon? Here, me. What about it? This about it... I want a kid called Tommy Gordon. He here? No. I mean, he's not here now. He's my brother and he lives with me, but I don't know where he is. What do you want him about? What are you looking in there for? I told you he wasn't around. Well, he'd better be around soon. We want to see him, and you'd better try finding him. Come on, break it up. It's all over. Why don't you go on home? Come on, beat it. I live on this block and I work on this block, and I got a right to see what's going on. Aw, shut up. Come on, go on home. - Don't push me! - Well, go on home. Well? The guy's sister's up there, but there's no sign of him. Are you sure you got the right place? I can hear, can't I? Gordon, 440. That's what the kid said, ain't it? Say, what's so important about gettin' the punk kid? It ain't so important to you, but it may be to me. Judge Griswald's got a brother what's got a kid... Extra! Read all about Baby Face Martin. Extra! Paper! Read all about it! Extra! Paper! Read all about the big killing here. Baby Face Martin killed. Extra! "Dawn Mourns for Baby Face. " Extra! Paper! Extra! Paper! Read all about the big killing here. Hey, fellas, listen to this. "Mystery man today shot and killed the famous Baby Face Martin. "The killing took place in a picturesque tenement basement, the walls covered with blood and bullets. " Says so in the paper. The paper can't be wrong. But that ain't the way it happened. "It is reported that his last thoughts were of his mother, "a plump, pink-cheeked little woman "who lives in a neat cottage near... Sunnyside, Long Island. " The old lady's lived up in that hole for 30 years. I don't get this. It says so in the paper. They found 20 grand in his pockets. Boy, 20 grand. He must've been a pretty smart guy. Baby Face? Sure, he was the tops. Public enemy number one. Boy, he wasn't scared of nobody. Boy, he could knock 'em all over like anything, like nothin'. - I got a machine gun. - Bang bang! No, you can't do that. You're dead. I shot you first. - Ah, you're wacky. - Yeah? So's your old... Boy, nothin' gonna stop their party now. I heard a guy say to Dave's girl that there was no use of her acting so funny, and they might as well all get soused. Hey, look! They're dancing like they like it! Boo hoo, I'll tell my mommy on you And as I sit here and sigh, says I I can't believe it's true Boo hoo Hey, look at me, fellas! I'm dancing! Look at me, I'm dancing! Look at me! Sit down. You smell. Yeah? Can you do better? Have you seen Tommy? We ain't seen a hair of him. We've been here for over an hour, and he ain't passed this way. Milty, have you seen Tommy? No, ma'am, not since I saw you. - Hey, the cops are wise to Tommy. - No kidding, no kidding. Ah, baloney. No baloney. Some guy snitched. No kidding. Hey, guys, how are the mickeys comin'? Gee. I bet a dollar he's sent to reform school. Sure, that's what they do, isn't it, T.B.? Yeah, they sent me to reform school for just swiping a bunch of bananas. And they was all rotten, too, most of them. I pity the guy who snitched. The mickeys are almost done now, guys. Ouch! Yeah, like a rock. Hey, T.B., do they give mickeys in reform school, like these, I mean? Slop they get, slop! Unless they get some dough to smear the jailies with. Tommy will get two years. Three maybe, I bet. Yeah, never mind. You learn a barrel of good things in reform school. Tommy will, too. Hey, listen, you guys, I'm not gonna tell you again. Aw, why don't you cut it out, you... I'm telling you, you put that fire out and get out of here, or I'll call a cop. Go slip in a lake. What? Nothin'. I'll marbleize ya, you goon! Ya big palooka! Hey, the fire's dyin' down. Better get some more wood. You get down behind there. You stay and guard those mickeys. Come on, let's go down to First Avenue. Angel. - Tommy! Gee... - Shut up! What are you gonna do? Run away so the bulls don't get me. But before I go, I'm gonna get the guy who snitched. - You know who it was? - Me? No. Come on, don't lie to me. I'll kill ya! You know me, Tommy. All right. I think I'm wise to who done it. - Who? - Spit. I'm gonna hide, so you do like I tell ya. When Spit gets back, tell him like this... the guy I stabbed was down here looking for Spit to give him five bucks for snitching on who done it. Got that straight? The guy what he got stabbed was down here lookin' for Spit to give him five bucks for... For snitchin' on who done it. Right. Okay. What are you gonna do to Spit if he done it? The mark of the squealer. Right. Now go and play your kazoo, see, like nothin' happened. Look out! Gee, Dave. Gee, how ya feelin'? How ya feelin'? We been lookin' all over for ya. The guys want to know all about what happened. Boy, that was some pretty one you shot across the roof. - The paper says you... - Yeah, all right, all right. You mean you don't want to tell about it? Boy, if it was me... Hey, there was some guys from the newspapers down at your joint, banging away. She was there a couple of times already. I've been looking for you. Are you all right? I tried to get to you, but... I'm all right. I was lucky. Your boat's sailing tonight, isn't it? Yes. I thought it best for me to go quickly. I came to see you this afternoon to find out about... Yes, I saw you. You did? Yes, and I saw what you felt. Yes, I was frightened. I thought I had been poor, but I never saw anything like... But now it wouldn't have to be. You'll have some money, and... I don't want to go. I won't go if you'll tell me not to. If I'll tell you not to? We could go away now. We could go away together... away from all this. We could have a year, at least a whole year together. And after that year was over? I don't know. Maybe back to this, but I don't care what comes after. We could have a year of happiness, and that's more than I thought I'd ever get. No, Kay, that's not what I want. It never was. I don't want a spree. That isn't what I was looking for. Look, Kay, you're an honest girl. I'll be honest, too, and then you'll understand. I knew this afternoon that we... Well, that it wasn't... That I wasn't what you wanted? That you'd made a mistake? I don't belong in your world, Kay. You don't belong in mine. It's good that we found that out now. Come on, Kay. We're waiting. Yes, I'm coming. I'm coming. Well... Goodbye. Goodbye, Kay. Come on, lift it around, will ya, T.B.? Look what I got! It'll go up like wildfire, huh! Boy, that'll keep the home fires burnin'! - Don't even have to break it up. - Hey, Spit... - Where'd you go for that crate, Joe? - Third. I went over around Schultz's. Boy, he had some beauts over there! Big ones, little ones... must have been selling out the business or somethin'. - Hey! - Where'd you get the crate? Hey! You think this'll burn? I think it'll burn like a house afire! It'll smell up the place. So you're still here, huh? Nah, we just left. All right, all right, I'll fix ya. All right, all right, I'll fix ya. Hey, Spit. - Hey, what are you doin'? - My mickey's done. Hey! That big one's mine! I swiped it! Aw, go on or I'll belt ya one! If Tommy was here, you wouldn't do that. - Hey, Spit. - Yeah? There was a guy here what... You know the guy what Tommy stabbed? Well, he was here. Yeah? What for? He was lookin' for you. - For me? - Yeah. He was gonna give you five bucks... I think it was five bucks... for snitchin' on who done it. Yeah? Where is he? Which way'd he go? Hey, don't snitch on Tommy! - What's it to ya? And you? - Nothin'. Shut up, or you'll get your lumps in a minute. Which way'd he go? Hey, let me go! I'm gonna give you something you won't get so easy. Say your prayers, you dog! Let me go! I didn't mean to rat! They had me! The cops had me! What could I do? Shut up! You know what you get for this, don't ya? Oh, don't cut me! Don't cut me! The mark of the squealer. - No kiddin'. - Wow! I'll give you anything, only take the knife... Shut up! Tommy! Tommy, you crazy? Give me that knife! Get away from me, Dave. I'll give it to him right away. It's gettin' easy, isn't it? Yeah, it's a cinch. Give me that knife. You've done enough! Now, give me that knife! Beat it, ya fink! Hey, have you seen...? If you're looking for your brother, he's down there. He just tried to cut my throat! Tell him I'll get him for this! - Where is he? - Down there! I'll get him for this! All her life she's worked and slaved for you, and for what? So she can take the rap for you every time you get in trouble? She's young and pretty and decent. She oughtta have something, too. So you're gonna run away, are you, the two of you? What for? So she can get old working for you? Listen, I've seen you before. There are thousands of you in streets like these. You saw the end of one of 'em today. Start out with knives and end up with guns. All right. If that's what you are, good luck to you. But leave her out of it. Let her forget you before it's too late. - Tommy! Tommy! - Spit squealed on me, Drina. I wasn't gonna hurt him. I was only gonna scare him. Why didn't you meet me? What's happened to you? Where is all this gonna end, Tommy? Know what, Drina? I think I'm gonna give myself up, tell 'em I didn't mean to do it. If I swear on the Bible I'll never do it again, maybe they'll let me go. - Get out of here! Go on home! - Gee, a cop! You want to set fire to this wharf? Let me catch you doing this again and I'll... Red, white, and blue coat, couldn't catch a nanny goat! - Hey, mister. - What do you want? Come on, beat it. - I'm Tommy Gordon. - What of it? I'm the kid that stabbed that man today. What? That's him, all right. Wait, I'll call Mr. Griswald. Now, you hold him here, do you hear me? Don't you tell me what to do. He was breaking my arm. That's why I did it. He didn't know what he was doing. He won't do it again. Let him go, please. You can tell that to the judge, Miss. He didn't mean to do it. Let him go! - Don't try that. Get away. - That ain't gonna help. He's right, Drina. That's not gonna help. Hey, Tommy, when you go to reform school... Get out of here, all of ya. Go on, get out of here. There he is, sir. - So you caught him? - Yes, sir. He didn't catch him. The kid gave himself up. I'm his sister. He gave himself up because he thought it was the right thing to do. - It was. - Then give him another chance. Careful of that arm, please. Oh, I'm sorry. Please give him another chance. Another chance to do what? To kill somebody this time? I won't ever do it again. You was hurtin' my arm, and I was seein' black. I'm going to take him away from here. He's a good boy. He's a smart boy. Then there's no excuse for him at all. All right, he made a mistake. He's sorry. Yes, a mistake happened. It's deep and painful. I know that. I'm sorry about that. Your being sorry won't help. Will it help to send him to reform school? Maybe not, but at least it'll keep him from doing it to somebody else. I swear I'll never do it again. He'll be better off where they'll send him. They'll at least take him from the gutter and teach him a useful trade. What do you know about it? Teach him a useful trade, will it? The man that was killed today came from this street and from that reform school. Taught him a useful trade, didn't it? It'll teach this kid one, too. That will be up to him. There is nothing else I can do. Didn't you ever do anything you were sorry for? Didn't anyone ever forgive you for anything? Don't you know what it means for people like us to be in trouble? I'm awfully sorry, believe me. I'm not punishing him for hurting me. That's done. But today, for no reason at all, he beat up my boy and stole his watch. There are other boys like mine. They've got to be protected, too. All right, officer. All right, let's go. Hey, Tommy, look up a guy named Smokey. Get away from here or I'll bounce one off your head. Get some water and put out that fire. Don't worry, Drina. I ain't so scared. No, don't be scared. I'm coming with you. Hey, Drina, wait. Look, there's a guy at reform school named Smokey. Liked to have a smoke. They call him Smokey. Now, you tell Tommy to be nice to him and give him things like cigarettes and that, 'cause this guy Smokey knows a lot of swell rackets for Tommy when he gets out. 'Course, Tommy's a... What's the matter? Wha'd I say? I didn't say nothin'. Wha'd I say? Aw, shut up. Don't worry, Drina. We'll get Tommy off. We'll go down in the morning and get the best lawyer in New York. It's a cinch if you've got the money. Yes... with $1.25 in my purse. I know, but I'll have the money, plenty of it. The reward money. I couldn't do that. You take your money and go away with her. Get yourself something you want, even if it's for a little while. Don't matter. Something. But Drina, that's not what I want. I found that out today. Remember when you first moved here? You were just a little kid. I never could think about you any other way. Drina! We're coming, darling. Holy smoke! You know, this guy Smokey, all the time at reform school, he used to sing a song about angels. If I had the wings of an angel! Let's go! That's right. That's it. If I had the wings of an angel Over these prison walls I would fly Straight to the arms of my mother And there I'd be willing to die I wish I had someone to love me...
