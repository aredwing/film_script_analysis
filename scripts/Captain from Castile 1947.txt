I gave the wretch some lashes yesterday for the good of his soul... and he rewards me by running off. When I get my hands on him, he'll run no more. - Are you with us, Pedro? - With pleasure, Diego. Have you picked up his trail? He was last seen along the Guardia, heading south. But I know these Indians. They're sick for their islands. He'll strike for Mlaga and the sea. Perhaps. But they're also shrewd as foxes. I'll wager he let himself be seen up here... then headed straight for Sanlcar on the seacoast to the north. That's well reasoned. You hunt in the valley toward the north. We'll continue in this direction. Very well. You scour the hills with your men and your dogs while I bring him in alone. That would indeed be a feather in your cap, Pedro, and a joke on me. Loose the dogs! You! You there! - What's in that bundle? - Clothes to be washed, seor. Sure you're not taking food to someone? - Oh, no, seor. - Well, open it up. Let me see. Have you seen anything of a man around here? A runaway slave? No, seor. Well, keep your eyes open. If you see anyone, report it to the authorities. Yes, seor. Seor Pedro. Coatl. I didn't know it was you who ran away. I sorry, seor. You forgive me? I not hurt you. You my friend. We hunt. We eat together. Why did you run away, Coatl? Look, seor. Five years ago, I am captured and brought to this country and sold as a slave. But Coatl no slave. In my own country across the sea, I am lord. I am prince. There de Silva be beggar beside me. I kill him if I could. Well, be that as it may, the whole countryside will be on your trail soon. De Silva has his dogs set on you now. You better go back and give yourself up while you still can. I die first. I see what happen to others who run away from de Silva. He cut leg muscles here. Never walk again. Crawl in and out his door for street boys to laugh at. No, seor. I never go back. Here, take these. I wish I had more. But you must hurry. Keep down the barranca and head for Sanlcar. Once there, you ought to be safe. Good luck and God go with you. - Thank you, Seor Pedro, my friend. - Here. Let go! Let go! Let go! Seor! Call them off, please! Let go! Let go! Let go! Devil take you! Let go! Careful, you wench! Don't hurt that dog! Then call him off, blast you! - I said don't hit that dog. - Let go! Devil take you! Let go! Let go! Stay away! Stay away! Don't touch me. I'll kill you. Stay away! Stay away! Hey, hombres. What's happening here? Nada, seor. This wench was teasing our dogs. Swine! Liar! Look, seor, my tablecloth. Holy saints, look at it. Seor, those are Seor de Silva's dogs. They're worth 10 of her. Seor de Silva will not thank you for risking them for one of your stupid jokes. Now be off with you! Or I'll spare your master the trouble of laying your backs bare. Be off! Be off! Madre de Dios. Lopez will murder me. Lopez? Who's Lopez? Sancho Lopez. Owner of the Rosario Inn where I work. His best tablecloth... ruined. All right, come along with me. I'll take you to the inn and explain to Lopez how it happened. Here, give me your hand. Me, seor? On your horse with you? Afraid? No. No, caballero. - Seor? - Yes? - I have seen you before. - Where? In church one day. Of course, you did not see me. You were in front, near the bishop's nose. I was in the back. - What's your name? - Catana. Catana Perez. Hold on tight, Catana. We're going over the wall. Come on! Welcome, seor. Welcome to the Rosario Inn. Oh, an honor, seor. Seorita. - Gracias, seor. - My pleasure, seorita. Lopez, if it hadn't been for the caballero, you might never have seen me again. Not see you again? Why? - Look what the dogs did to this tablecloth. - The dogs? - Whose dogs? - Diego de Silva's. Diego de Silva? Holy saints! It wasn't Catana's fault. She defended your property as best she could. You wait. Just wait till my brother, Manuel, hears of this. Be quiet. The cloth can be mended. I don't want no trouble with Diego de Silva. - Now come, seor. What's your pleasure? - To quench my thirst. Jose! Jose! Quick! Quick! The caballero's horse. It's not every day we have the honor of serving a caballero at the Rosario Inn. Hurry up. Hurry up. Wine for the seor. The best. Bread and cheese too. Pronto! This way, seor. Catana, pronto! - By your leave. Juan Garcia's my name. - Pedro de Vargas. - The son of Don Francisco de Vargas? - Yes. Ah, a great cavalier, Don Francisco. I've seen him. That is, I've heard of him often. As who has not? Do me the honor to join me in a drink to his health. - Gracias, seor. - Innkeeper! - S, seor. - Your best Malaga. Right away. Pronto. Yes, in the Indies, I've heard many soldiers from the Moorish wars... and several from the Italian, speak of your father. The Indies? You have been to the Indies, seor? For many years. Ten years to be exact. Came home and landed at Sanlcar just two days ago. - That's not Malaga. - No, seor. Tell me about the Indies, seor. That word sets your imagination on fire, doesn't it? Well, why not? It's a new world, my friend. Listen, I stood on the waterfront of Santiago and looked north. Ah, you could feel the great land out there. Tell me, seor, is it true that there's a country on the southern sea... where heathen Indians live in palaces and eat their food off plates of gold? Aye, and all that. Kingdoms, empires, mountains of gold... just waiting to be taken by the first cavalier with guts enough to venture. - To your health, caballero. - Gracias. Do you plan to go back to the Indies, seor? The only reason I'm here now is to see my mother. She's had a thin life. But not from now on. Gonna take her back with me to the Indies where she'll have a house of her own... a mule, meat every day. I haven't done badly of late years. My share of a property in Santo Domingo brought me 2,000 gold ducats. 2,000? - Another cup of wine, caballero. - Uh, gracias. To the New World, seor. The New World. You do not drink. Uh, no. But please don't let it disturb you. I buy wine for the good of the house. A penance? Something like that. I'm an ordinary man when sober. When drunk, I'm not a man, I'm a beast. I want to kill. Probably, I have a devil in me. Though heaven knows, I've done what I could to get rid of it. Spent a pile of money on candles and But they never worked. So So I don't drink. - Lopez. - Seor. My horse. Thank you for your hospitality, seor. It's getting late. And if you will excuse me - Does it happen that you're riding into Jan? - Yes. Well, then, by your leave, I'll ride with you. - Girl. Have the boy bring my animal too. - S, seor. And, uh, here. - This'll fetch you a new dress. - Gracias. But it's gold. It's a gold ducat. I've never had one before. It would buy 10 dresses. Then buy yourself a trousseau. If you can't find a husband, call on me. We need her kind in the Indies. - Adis, Lopez. - Adis, seor. - Good-bye, seor. - Adis, Catana. - Thank you again, caballero. - It was a pleasure, seorita. - Did you give my animal his oats as I told you? - S, seor. Gracias, seor. - What magic is this? - Clever, isn't it? There's a rascal at Sanlcar makes a specialty of such tricks. Tips you off what disguise to use and teaches you how to put it on. They say he's been schoolmaster to the ablest rogues in Spain. One thing you can be sure of, I paid him a fat price. But what the devil? Anything that saves your life is worth money. Adis, Lopez. Adis, seor. Adis, seor. When Christopher Columbus made his first voyage 26 years ago... he took the prison scum of Cdiz with him. Rascals. Deserters. Lawbreakers. And it's been that way ever since. I don't know about that, sir. But, Father, this man I met today... tells me that there are new lands, empires, gold, just waiting to be taken. That proves he's a rogue. Columbus discovered some islands peopled with naked savages. What little gold they found hasn't even paid for the good ships wrecked... or the funds wasted, let alone brought in a return. Don't listen to such gossip. Yet, Father, this man says he left Spain poor and came back with 2,000 ducats. Probably a lie. Why not make it 50,000? Ah, Seor de Silva. Seor de Vargas. Your servant, seora. Seorita. - Pedro. - Diego. I apologize for stopping in unexpectedly... but I was passing and could not resist the temptation. - A cup of wine with us, seor? - Gracias. By your leave, seora. This weather, while excellent for the crops, is a little warm for much riding. I confess I feel slightly fatigued after the hunt for my servant. You found no trace of him? Excellent wine. Unfortunately not. It's my belief that someone gave him aid. It's not the loss of a servant alone that concerns me. Rather, it's that a heretic, an unbeliever, should have been permitted to escape unredeemed. But he'll be taken... at which time the Inquisition will deal with him. You are an intimate of the inquisidor general, are you not, seor? I have the honor to be el supremo of the Santa Hermandad... which is entrusted by His Majesty, Don Carlos... with the duty of passing sentence on those poor sinners... whom the Holy Office have found guilty of heresy. A great privilege, seor. By the way... it seems strange to me that a man of your name and fame should not be one of us. - I am not a theologian. - Nor am I. Of course, I regret that at times we must use severity. But what would you have? Bloodletting and dosing are often necessary to save the body. Surely one cannot object to medicine that saves the soul. With your permission, we will not pursue this conversation. There are ladies present. The subject is most unpleasant. Unpleasant to know that there are those who are defending Christianity... by spending themselves to uproot the detestable sin of heresy? Is it possible, seor, you do not approve the Santa Hermandad? I do not approve, sir. I am a Catholic and have given more blood for the faith than you have in your entire body... and I regard the Santa Hermandad as an evil. I am against any organization, sir... which turn friend against friend, child against father. Do I make myself plain? Quite plain, Don Francisco. But why do you wish to pick a quarrel with me? I came here peaceably and alone, though injured by your son. Perhaps I should have brought witnesses. - Injured? How injured? - If I attacked two of your servants... opened the face of one and slashed one of your dogs, wouldn't you call it injury? Add to it that your men set their dogs on a girl, seor. That makes a difference. Oh, yes, I forgot. I believe my men were having some innocent fun with a wench at the Rosario Inn... of whom, it appears, your son is unduly fond. - That's a lie! - A lie? That you stayed behind to fondle the wench and ride with her to the privacy of Rosario? Or did my fellow see wrong? At least I'm sure that the Lady Luisa de Carvajal Be careful not to bring the Lady Luisa into this. And her father, the marquis, will not be amused to hear of it, either. Seor, my son's conduct is a matter I'll settle with him. If your men were innocent, I shall pay any proper claim. But that has nothing to do with what we were discussing. If anything I have said displeases you... I shall be glad to give you satisfaction at your pleasure. And I, seor. Thank you. But suppose you leave the question of satisfaction to me. What did he mean by leaving the satisfaction to him? Nothing. The man is a coward. Excuse us, my dear. Come, dear. Now, about this girl. It's true, Father. She rode with me on my horse to the Rosario. - Who is she? - A servant girl, sir. She works at the inn. Son, I'm no hypocrite. I've had sweethearts in my time. But I warn you. It's unbefitting your name to have such stories spread abroad... especially now since you've openly paid your respects to the Lady Luisa de Carvajal. - Yes, sir. - By the by, are you calling on the Lady Luisa this evening? - With your permission, Father. - With it or without it, I warrant. - Give her my respects. - Yes, sir. That was beautiful, seorita. Thank you, Seor de Vargas. May I tell you something, seorita? If you wish. Yesterday in church... a ray of sunlight, slanting through one of the narrow windows, rested on your face. I held my breath, seorita. - I knew at once that it was a divine revelation. - Pedro. That you were destined to be my lady of ladies. I knew then that I would always adore you, serve you... and and I hope that one day I may be worthy. That you may care for me... - and love me as I love you. - Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Is it the custom of a gentleman to forget the proper distance? It was the enchantment, seora. I didn't realize what I was doing. Well, at least you're a charming liar. We must go in, Luisa. There are lights in the upper floor. Your father has returned. Oh, yes, seora. May I keep this as a token, as a favor to wear? Yes. Though I wish I had something better to give you. Better? The Golden Fleece from the hands of His Majesty could not mean half so much. Tomorrow night, seorita? Perhaps. Good night. Seora. Did you notice the way his eyes light up when he smiles? Yes. He's not unattractive. - Seor. Pedro de Vargas. - What do you want? - Who is it? - It's me, Catana Perez. Manuel. We've been here for an hour hoping to head you off. - Head me off? From what? - You mustn't go home. They've laid a trap for you. - They? Who? - The Inquisition. Your father, mother and sister have been arrested. - What? - This is my brother, Manuel, turnkey at the prison. He saw them brought in and heard the talk about arresting you. - But what have they done? - Well, the charge is heresy. Heresy? - My father and mother heretics? It's a lie. - You've no time to lose. A friend of mine has a hiding place in the mountains near Granada. Perhaps he can get you to the sea. It's your only chance. No. Father DeLora, the inquisidor general. - He knows my father. I'll go to him. - His Reverence, Father DeLora... was at the prison with Seor de Silva when your father, mother and sister were brought in. The Marquis de Carvajal, my father's best friend. He'll advise You know best, seor. Only, seor, if anything goes wrong, if you need me Thank you, Catana. And you too, Manuel. Forget or remember. I only did it for Catana. I've got to hustle back or it's a twisted neck for me. Yes. You'd better go too. They mustn't catch you helping me. God go with you, seor. Who? Whom did you say it is? Pedro de Vargas, Seor Marquis. He says it is a matter of life and death. - Whose life and death? - He didn't say, mi seor. Well, let him enter. Will you please enter? - Seor Marquis. - Come closer, young man. Here, if you please. The son of Francisco de Vargas always has the bedside privilege with me. I apologize, Seor Marquis, for intruding at this hour. Oh, don't mention it. I'm always at your father's service. - There's no one whom I more affectionately admire. - Thank you, sir. I gather from your manner that all is not well. It's an honor that you've turned to me. It will be a double honor if I am privileged to help you. My father and mother have been arrested by the Holy Office. The Inquisition? But you know my father and mother are not guilty of heresy. And my sister, why, she's just a child. I knew that if I came here you would give me advice. If this were a case before the civil courts... but the Inquisition is a different matter. What right has a layman to intervene in spiritual affairs? Perhaps something in your parents' lives But you know them, sir. You know there couldn't be anything. My boy, you're blinded by natural affection. If there's no guilt, your parents will go free. Your advice then? Is to rely on God, my dear boy. In the meanwhile, proceed at once to the prison and give yourself up. And deprive my family of the one voice outside the prison left to take their part? It would tend to show your innocence and be an act of loyalty to your parents. - I thank you, Seor Marquis, for your advice. - You're quite welcome. It's a pleasure to be of help to the son of an old friend. My servant will show you to the door. If my father were in your place... and a member of your family came to him for help... he would have advanced to the very gates of hell without looking back to give you aid. I hope he never learns that I have brought dishonor on his name by even coming to you. - Get out! - Yes, sir, I will. - Alto! - There he is! Get him! Alto! You lied! And you lied again when you said you gave no aid to this escaped heretic... this Indian dog who calls himself a great lord. Admit you lied because you hate the Santa Hermandad. Your silence calls for a physic you may not like. It will do you little good to waste your threats on someone who does not fear them. It would be wiser for you to explain this outrage upon my family. I demand to know what you have done with my father, mother and sister! You... demand? The charges that you have brought against them... have no foundation in truth and you know it. I here and now accuse you of bearing false witness for reasons of cowardice. - Bring in the other prisoners! - Yes, seor. Bring the other prisoners! Move on. Move on. Move along. Move along! - Father. - My son - Silence! - Silence yourself. - I'll have no prison whelp ordering my parents. - Hmm. I thought there was a cursed bad smell in this place. This is not the moment for swagger, Francisco de Vargas. A gag may teach you what old age has not. Do you confess to the crime of which you stand charged? Confess that I'm a heretic, an unbeliever, that I taught irreverence to my family? Huh. The lie stinks. From the lips of children, we're apt sooner to hear the truth. Begin with the girl. - S, seor. - No, you can't - No! No! - Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! - No! No! - Mother! - No! - Mother! Help me! No! No, no, no! Please! Please, seor! Take me! Take me! Please, seor! Take me! She's so young, so innocent. Don't, wife! Don't! Would you give this lout the satisfaction No. Wait. No, please. Not her! I'll confess. - I'll confess anything if you'll just release her. - No. Do not save her by a lie. Silva, if you do this thing, look to your own soul. - Apply the cords! - Apply the cords. Please. Please, seor. I beg of you, have mercy. Hail, Mary, full of grace. - The Lord is with thee - Mother! Seor el Supremo, the girl has fainted. - Well, revive her! - Please. Please, seor. She's just a baby. Please, seor. She's just a little baby. Seor el Supremo, the girl is dead. You bungling fools. Have you no skill in your craft? Have you no skill in your craft? God has shown his mercy. Upon you rest his curse. Return the prisoners to their cells. - Are you awake? - Juan Garcia. How did you get in here? I bought this job of turnkey to be here near my mother. Your mother, in here? The Inquisition accused her of heresy. They sentenced her to be burned at the stake. They'll not burn her now. She's dead. Dead? Catana Perez told me about you, so I came here to help. We'll make a break for it as soon as we can. But my father and mother are here in prison. If I run away, there's no telling what they'll do to them. Everything's arranged. Your father and mother will come with us. Keep these on. Others may come in here to look at you. Hide this. You'll need these when the time comes. - I don't know how to thank you. - Save it until later, caballero. Perhaps you wonder why I trouble with the de Vargas family. Because of the unfortunate accident to your sister... I am prepared to offer you leniency... provided you sign a confession... that you and your parents are guilty of heresy. Otherwise, I shall have no recourse but to remove you. When you remove someone, seor... you are careful not to risk your own skin... which is probably wise. If you mean that I do not give swashbucklers... the satisfaction of a duel, you're quite right. My object is simply to dispose of them as a warning to others. In the end, you will learn that my method is thorough. As thorough as your dishonor, if possible. Dirty-tongued infants must be taught politeness. Stand up when a gentleman speaks. Hey, guard! Guard! You out there! What about satisfaction now, de Silva? Where is your policy and method? - One by one, de Silva. - Mercy. For God's sake, have mercy. You wouldn't kill an unarmed man. De Vargas, you wouldn't murder me. - Bareheaded before death, coward. - I'll let you go free. You have one moment left. Spend it thinking of the child, my sister, that you murdered. Oh, have mercy. Have mercy. I beg you. I beg you. - You'd make amends, perhaps? - Yes. - Secure our release? - Yes. - Pay a suitable fine? Make public apology? - Yes. Yes. Anything. Everything. - Can I trust you? - I swear it. I swear before God. Oh, no, not before God, de Silva. Perhaps if you renounced your faith in God, I'd believe you. You've defiled everything that the Church stands for. Now... renounce your faith in God. Yes. Anything. I'll renounce God. Spare my life. Now answer to God for your crimes. Hurry. Come on. We've got no more than a minute. For heaven's sake, hurry, seores. The others are waiting. - Pedro. - Pedro. - Mother, Father, this is Juan Garcia. - Seor. Quick, seores. Hurry. I must sound the alarm. - Your horses are there. - God bless you. - Catana. - Hurry, seor. We'll have to race for it. - Mother, Father, Catana Perez. - Seorita. - This horse is for you, seora. - I fear it will be of no help riding with a woman like me. What we lose in speed we gain in honor... - riding with Doa Maria de Vargas. - Come along. Guards! Guards! Prisoner escaped from the lower cell! Prisoner escaped from the lower cell! Guards! Guards! Prisoner escaped from the lower cell! Gracious sir and lady, Your Mercy's servant, Hernn Soler. I never expected the honor of serving so renowned a captain... - or so noble a lady. - Thank you, seor. And now may I ask what are your plans? To leave immediately. Don't dismount. Seor, my wife is almost spent. If she could have a carriage Impossible. There's no road for a carriage where we're going. Wait for me here, chiquilla. I'll be back tomorrow. And see that you look your best for my homecoming. I'll take orders from you when you've carried out your part of the bargain. What bargain? My part was to take you across the mountains, seor. And the other part? That you get started quick, seor, so so my Hernn can get back to me. I'm his girl now. I love him. Seores. I've a notion to take you with me. Why not? I can ride with the seora. I can hear the horses on the road. - Go! Go! - We'd better hurry, seores. There are horses on the road. - Soler, you lead the way. Juan and I will guard the rear. - Come on. They're pressing us fast. We'll have to make better time or they'll overtake us. My wife can't go any faster. Alto! Seor Soler! Seor Soler! Alto! Look, you! Here! I remember this trail from the Moorish wars. Good only for goats, seor. A woman could never make it. In that case, the ladies will keep to the road, and I'll stay with them. You gentlemen wait here for our pursuers. Let them have a glimpse of you, then take to the trail. My guess is they'll think we all went in that direction and follow you. I bargained to lead you to the coast, not to fight. Either I ride with the ladies too or adis. You're quite right, seor. A bargain is a bargain. Juan and I will stay behind. Good-bye, Mother. Bear yourself well, my son. My blessings go with you. - God be with you, seor. - And with you, Catana, always. - Good-bye, Father. - Good-bye, Son. Be ready. They're coming. We must act fast. Seor! Seor! Alto! There they are! After them! - There is tu pap. - Papa. - Such abominable treachery. - Treachery, Father? What kind of treachery? The worst. The blackest. Seor de Silva entered that scoundrel Pedro de Vargas's cell... with a view to getting a confession which would help him before the tribunal an act, mind you, of Christian charity and de Vargas sprang upon him unawares... drove a sword through his body, then escaped. Escaped? Are you sure? But never fear, he'll be taken. La Santa Hermandad has a long arm. Oh, how terrible. Mmm. There's one cheerful aspect to the affair. The sword was deflected by a rib and missed the heart. Oh, Seor de Silva is, of course, in a grave way. But unless mortification sets in, the doctors have hope of his recovery. Only three days ago, Seor de Silva called on me. And at his entreaty, it was practically arranged that I give you in marriage to him. Isn't that a fine choice? Haven't I done well by you? As I have often told her, my lord... you're a very fortunate girl, my dear, to have so thoughtful and generous a father. Oh, tut, tut. Why shouldn't I be generous? The child's happiness is my only concern in this world. - Do you think Pedro will be captured? - I hope not. It would be dreadful. I'd die. If he were caught and they found my handkerchief Oh. We must pray for him. Yes. Let's go pray now. - I promise 10 candles to San Cristobal if he escapes. - Good for you, my dear. Seor, you do not have to gather wood. I would do that. You steal the chickens. I'll get the wood. - Is she beautiful, seor? - She? Who? The lady whose handkerchief you carry over your heart. Very beautiful. A great and lovely lady whom I am privileged to serve. Who is she, seor? The Lady Luisa de Carvajal. Oh, yes, seor. She is beautiful. I have seen her in church. And once I saw her riding in a procession with her father. All eyes were on her. I said to myself then, she looks like a jewel in the sunlight. You are very fortunate, seor. Yes. It's me. - Well? - Nothing to fret about. I went right into Sanlcar in this, God forgive me... and not a hint of trouble. - Mmm! Smells good. - Chicken's almost done, seor. You should have been with me, lad. I ran into an old friend of mine, Jorge Santerra. He's master of the Boniface, which sails for the Indies tomorrow and Never mind about that. Did you find out when there's a ship for Italy? Uh, your ship's the Julia. Sailing in about a week. But this friend of mine, he was telling me that before he left Cuba... all the talk was of a vast armada that Governor Velzquez was fitting out... to take over a new land, a country full of gold. He told me that every politician in the place... is hanging around the governor like a pack of dogs after meat, scheming for command. But the talk was that Hernn Cortez would get it. Who's Hernn Cortez? A very courageous soldier... and a very popular gentleman, especially with the ladies. Come on, lad, this is the chance of a lifetime. Forget Italy. Let's go to the Indies. They say every man that goes with Cortez will share in the profits and come back rich. No, it's impossible. If my family are still alive, they're in Italy. They'll be expecting me. I mustn't fail them. Besides, what's this itch that's got hold of you? Isn't there anything else in life but gold? Perhaps. But there's a lot to be said for gold too. It got you out of prison, didn't it? Besides, you're wrong about the islands. We talk of gold, but maybe we mean something else. Gold is just the excuse. Have you space for me on the Boniface, seor? - For you? - Why not? What has Europe to offer me? If I'm taken here, it means death. Italy would be no better. Spending the rest of my days scratching fleas in some big lord's kitchen. I've got no kinsmen to give me a leg up. Catana, my mother's kinsmen are the Strozzis. One of my uncles is a cardinal. - If you went there, they'd look after you. - Perhaps. But I'd be a sow's ear just the same. In the islands, it's different. Juan says it's what you are, not who you are, that counts. It's a new world. So it is. Europe's an old road. This is a new one. Change your mind, lad. Think what can happen. You'll come home, your head high, on horseback, rich, famous, exonerated. All the things you hanker for. Isn't this the answer, seor, to everything you want... for yourself, for your family... for the one whose handkerchief you carry? All right, I'll go. Bravo! Now you're talking good sense. To the Indies. The new road. Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! "In His Majesty's name. "Tell everyone that the fleet now in Havana harbor... "will sail by authority of His Excellency... "Diego Velzquez... "governor of Cuba... "for trade, settlement and discovery... under the command of Hernn Cortez. " "Enroll for God and His Majesty, Don Carlos... "under his banner. Carry the light of our blessed faith to those in heathen darkness. " Blast my guts! If it isn't Bull Garcia! Humpback Botello! I thought I'd find you here. Seen Cortez yet? That's what I'm here for. Meet my friends, Pedro de Vargas, Catana Perez. This is Professor Botello. He's an astrologer and a sawbones. Can reads the stars better than I can a book. What are you doing here, Professor? I signed on to give Captain Cortez the divine wisdom... of what the stars have in store for him and to mend any bones that are broken. We're beginning to be quite an army already. Over 400 strong, not counting seamen, the Indian lords and servants. Come on. Let's have a drink. - Oh, no. Not until after we've had a talk with the captain. - All right. See you tonight. - Come on. Let's go inside and sign up. - You wait out here, Catana. "...under the command of Hernn Cortez." "Enroll for God and His Majesty, Don Carlos... "under his banner. - Carry the light!" - Sign the articles here. - Your name? - Emilio Eduardo. - Can you write? - S. - Your name? - Gonzalo Ochoa. - Where from? - Santo Domingo. - Where from? - Crdoba. - Sign the articles. - Sign the articles. - Your name? - Juan Garcia. - Sign here. - Where from? Santo Domingo. Sign the articles here. - Your name? - Pedro de Vargas. Sign here. - Where from? - Jan, Spain. Are you a relative of Francisco de Vargas? - His son, sir. - I am Hernn Cortez. Our fathers were friends, though mine never reached the eminence of yours. - Your illustrious father is well? - When I last saw him, sir. I'm delighted to have you join us in this venture. If you have the spirit and merit of your father, you'll prove worthy of promotion... - and a command. - Thank you, Captain. Oh, gentlemen. A good omen. The son of Francisco de Vargas joins our company. - This is Corio, the first officer of the Gallega. - How do you do? - This is Captain Sandoval. - Captain. - Seor. - Captain Alvarado. - Welcome to the expedition. - Thank you. And this is our chaplain, Father Bartolom de Olmedo. - Father. - De Vargas. And here we have Seor Juan Escudero and Seor Diego Cermeno. - Seores. - These two gentlemen... are representatives of His Excellency, the governor of Cuba. They came from Santiago at the last moment to relieve me of my command... but I believe I've successfully convinced them... that I am going to be the captain of this company... or there isn't going to be any captain... eh, gentlemen? And who might you be? - Catana Perez, sir. - One of our ladies, eh? We've quite a few in the army already. Some married and some in hopes of it. Sometimes I think you women will end up with more gold out of this... one way or the other, than any of us. You wish to inscribe your name on the roll of the company, little one? Oh, yes, sir. Thank you, my lord. Oh, Father. Don't get up, Pedro. I'll join you. Thinking of Jan, eh? Yes, Father. How did you know? When a young man sits staring to the east with a lady's handkerchief in his hands... what else should he be thinking of but his home and his sweetheart? Well, cheer up. Perhaps your dreams will come true. If I get only half of what I want, Father... I'll be satisfied. Now, let me ask you a simple question. Why haven't you been to Mass? Because... I killed a man. And I'd kill him again without hesitation. Go on. But I I duped the coward into renouncing God before I killed him. That's why I haven't been to Mass. Who was the man? Diego de Silva, el Supremo de la Santa Hermandad in Jan. Why did you kill him? He caused the death of my sister... the imprisonment of my parents, the loss of everything I loved. And now, Father, I I place myself in your hands. No, my son... you've been in my hands for two days. Except for forcing de Silva to renounce God, you've told me nothing I didn't know already. Only I wanted to hear it from your own lips. This is an order from the Santa Hermandad... for your arrest. I am not in sympathy with the actions of the Order of Santa Hermandad. However, had you not told me this yourself... I would not have done this. You have a penance to perform, my son. Pray for the soul of Diego de Silva. This is more of a penance than you think. God's love is a heavy burden. Are you prepared to carry it out? What is demanded of you is not easy. Do you, as you hope for salvation, accept the penance? Yes, Father. Milords, the ambassador has been sent... by the great emperor, Moctezuma... to present these gifts to the great white god. By my soul, the generosity of the people of this New World. In Yucatn, a chief presents me with a treasure beyond price this lovely creature who gives me the voice of these people. And now this. Doa Marina, say to the ambassador... that on behalf of His Majesty, Don Carlos of Spain, the mightiest ruler on Earth... - I thank the Emperor Moctezuma. - Yes, milord. Milord, the ambassador regrets... to say that the emperor's kingdom is many leagues to the west... and dangerous to reach. He desires you to accept these gifts and return at once to your own country. The great emperor Moctezuma sends nuggets of gold to us prospectors - Looks very pretty on you, my dear. - Thank you, milord. And then asks us kindly not to visit the mine. - Moctezuma has made a very wise request, Captain Cortez. - How wise, Escudero? We came here to trade and have a look at the land... - not to start a war and try to conquer an empire. - We came to settle, to colonize. There wasn't a word about settlement in the governor of Cuba's instructions to you. Do you think that 500 men and 11 ships sailed all this distance... with the idea of riding back and forth in trade? Or that the great emperor Moctezuma has stripped himself for our benefit? That there isn't a thousandfold more where this came from? By my beard, gentlemen, these are but scraps and samples. Are we going to be content with trifles... when we could help ourselves to the whole treasury? And mark you, he fears us, or he would have sent nothing at all. - But Governor Velzquez - I take no orders from Governor Velzquez! I am the law here. Men... this land holds out to us a glorious prize... but it must be won. Great things were never achieved without exertion. We are few in numbers, but strong in resolution. Put your faith in me and in the Almighty... and we will go forward and carry to a glorious conclusion... the work so auspiciously begun here this day. Oh, try to bite me, will ya? Oh, you want to kick too, hmm? Good horse. I like your spirit. Reminds me of my father's horse, Campeador. - Well, you ride him. No more horses or blisters for me. Come, seores, and get your suppers before the others get it. Thank you, seorita. There's a female for you. Just fits in to this New World. Good deal on your mind, isn't she? Well, she's free. But you're giving me only the juice from the top. Dig down deep and give me some meat from the bottom. I will, seor, if you do me a little favor. I'll do anything, if you're only generous with the meat. What do you want? Seor, I'm in love. Oh, bless my soul. Then it's your fortune in the stars that you want. No. I want the love of a certain gentleman. Does he love you? All he thinks about is a fine lady in Spain. If it's Pedro de Vargas that you're talking of... he's of noble birth and you're just a wench. - Give me my meat. - If I could only make him love me... 1/10th as much as I love him, I wouldn't ask for anything more. Well, what can I do about it? You're wise and have secret powers. If you could give me a charm... something that would win him, that would make him care for me. Oh, the devil. Do you take me for a witch selling love powders? Oh, vaya, vaya, vaya. You're just a wench, and you mean no harm. Give me the meat. Then it's a bargain? You will give me just one little charm? Very well. But remember, these are secret matters. I have a ring... from Rome, given me by Seor Incubo himself. 10,000 spells. I repeat. 10,000 separate spells went into the making of it. I expect a queen to buy it for a tub of gold. It's worth no less. Could you lend it to me for just a little while, seor? I couldn't part with it. The ring is priceless. Oh, go on. Go on. Have it your own way. It's known as the Rose of Delight. Put it on your finger. No, wait. Let me slip it on your thumb. In a minute you'll feel the heat of it. Such is the power it holds. Meat. Now that is what I call magic. Oh, it's wonderful, seor. I can feel the heat already. - Good. I'll let you see it again sometime. - Oh, please, seor. If you let me keep it, I'll mend for you, I'll wash for you. I'll save you the choicest bits of the pot. Woman, you're a robber. I told you the ring is priceless. Washing and mending, eh? All right. Have it your way. A kind heart was always my undoing. Keep the ring, but guard it preciously. If you lose it, the seven curses of Incubo will shrivel you up like an onion. More meat. Oh. Thank you, Botello. Thank you. I will guard the ring. I'll guard it with my life. Hey, Catana! Give us a zarabanda! - Zarabanda! - Oh, to the devil with you! I've been working and slogging all day. - You think I'm going to kick up my heels all night to amuse you? - Oh, come on! Oh, come on. Give us a little fun. It takes two to do the zarabanda. - Who's dancing against me? - At your service, se Do you have to invite someone to dance when I'm around? Zarabanda! Music, hombres. What's wrong, bonita? I'm not a ghost. You took me by surprise, seor. I hadn't seen you. - Take the ring back. - Oh, no, no. - Take it back! - No. Keep it till tomorrow. It worked, didn't it? I never want to see it again. I hate it! Catana. No. Please, no, seor. You're beautiful, Catana. - I didn't realize you were so beautiful. - Oh, no. No. Please. It came to me tonight that I love you. - It's like a fever. - Oh, please, seor. You don't know what you're saying. You don't love me. It was the ring. The ring? What ring? The ring that Botello gave me. I wanted to make you love me... but now I know it isn't love. It's the spell of magic. - What sort of nonsense is this? - It's true, seor. I couldn't wait for you to come to me of your own accord. I had to put a spell on you. But I did come to you of my own accord. Will you marry me, Catana? What did you say, my lord? Father Bartolom is waiting. - He will marry us tonight. - Oh, you're mad, seor. Noblemen don't marry camp giris. How could you return to Spain? - Sir, there's a village in that valley just over the ridge. - With ample water? - Yes, sir. - Any signs of hostility? No, but there's another delegation of ambassadors from the Emperor Moctezuma. We'll take no chances. If there's an attack, I want the advantage of higher ground. Captain Sandoval. - Go to the rear and speed up the column. - Yes, sir. - Doa Marina. - Yes, milord? There's a village in the next valley. Do you know what tribe lives there? Yes, milord. They are the Totonacos. - Are they friendly? - Well, sometimes they are, sometimes they are not. By heavens, Captain. A king's ransom! Yes. The closer we come to the mines, gentlemen, the bigger the nuggets. These jewels and treasures will go to His Majesty, Don Carlos. - They'll secure the recognition we need for our colony. - But, sir The price comes high, gentlemen, but it's worth it... to get the governor of Cuba off our tail. In other words, a bribe from the Emperor Moctezuma, ruler of this heathen land... to bribe His Catholic Majesty, ruler of Christian Spain. By my soul, Father, that's neatly put. Is gold the only thought of this enterprise? Is it the ducat or the cross we bear upon our banner? I leave such theological matters to you, Father... while I proceed with His Majesty's business and my own. My dear, this seems to have been made just to fit your beautiful neck. Thank you, milord. - Doa Marina. - Yes, milord? Say to the ambassadors that I am gratified by this further evidence of goodwill... and look forward eagerly to visiting their emperor soon in person. Yes, milord. Milord, the ambassador says... Emperor Moctezuma knows you and your men tired after long journey... and warns any further advance, big danger. He says you must turn back. Leave this country now. Tell the ambassador that Castilians are never tired... and that we're well able to meet and dispose of any dangers that lie ahead of us. Yes, milord. - You. Pedro de Vargas. - Yes, sir. - Come with me. Captain Alvarado. - Yes, sir. Have this treasure moved to the temple we're using as a guardhouse. Yes, sir. De Vargas, I promised you an opportunity to win promotion. - I'm now giving you that opportunity. - Thank you, sir. - He's crazy! - He's not only drunk, he's crazy! - Stop him! - Take aim, Sanchez. Blast you, Garcia, I'll not have my men murdered by a maniac. One, two, three! Oh, put down that knife, you fool. Don't make me have to kill you. - Slobbering over the torture of women and children. - Four, five... six, seven - Burn my mother at the stake, will ya? - Eight! - Come on, you fiends! - Nine!You fool!You can't stop a steel bolt. - Ready, Sanchez? - Yes, sir. - Ten! - Don't do it. - Vargas! - Vargas! Juan. Juan, don't you know me? It's Pedro, your friend. Look to yourself, dog. You're not de Silva. Why, you're I knew I could count on you, lad. These dogs. They'll not burn my mother. I'll kill her with my own hands first. These are your friends, Juan. Your friends. Friends? Phew!Holy saints, that was close! I'm grateful to you, de Vargas. Would've been a shame to kill him, but what could I do? He was bent on murder. - Douse him with a pail of water. - No, sir. It would be better to let him sleep it off. A word, seores. You've all known Juan Garcia as a sober man and a good friend. Will you do him and me the favor to keep this to yourselves? It would be a poor thing if we couldn't do that for old Bull. And, gentlemen, not a word about me in this either. - I left my post to come here. - Well, you get back there quickly. And I'll cut the ears off of anybody who talks. - Thank you, sir. - I'll stay here with him, seor. Good. Put a bucket of water beside him. He'll be on fire when he wakes up. Yes, sir. You, Jose, go get him a bucket of water. - All quiet? - Not a sound. Gracias. Since when have you taken the liberty of opening those chests? Be good enough to hand over those gems. - I don't have them, sir. - Where are they? I don't know, sir. They're gone. I went out of my way to give you an opportunity for advancement, de Vargas. I, uh I had just discovered that the lock was broken, sir. The fact is, I left my post and had just returned You, the son of Francisco de Vargas, disobeyed orders, deserted your post? Juan Garcia was ill, sir. They sent for me. So a soldier in charge of an important post walks off at his pleasure... to hold the hand of a sick friend. Very charitable. We'll deal with that in its place. What were your two guards doing? Were they off for a stroll too? Or are you suggesting they rifled the chest? - No, sir. I locked the door myself when I went out. - Heaven give me patience. Do you expect me to believe someone walked through solid masonry into this room? Now hand over those gems. Don't force me to have you stripped. - Whoever took the gems, sir, came through that door in the wall. - What door? I see no door! One moment, sir. By your leave. When I came back it was ajar. By my faith, de Vargas, I misjudged you. You're even a poor liar. I'm not lying, sir. On my honor, there's a door here somewhere. Don't speak to me of honor. Consider yourself under arrest. Guard! Look, sir! Bless my soul. Hmm. And I had a door built. - Where's the lock to this chest? - Right here. That's odd. This has been filed. The Indians have no steel. It must have been one of our own men. I should hate to see you hang, de Vargas... but I have no doubt that will be the decision of my captains, unless these gems are recovered. I'll give you until this hour tomorrow to recover them. You're relieved of your duty. Yes, sir. Guard. Call additional men to move these chests to my quarters. S, seor. Oh. Oh. Oh, my head. Oh!Oh! Oh, my poor head. Oh. - Botello. What happened? - What misery. - I'm lucky to even be alive. Oh, my poor head. - But what happened? - You won't tell on me, Pedro, lad? - Of course not. I was just taking a stroll with one of the Indian ladies. Ugly as sin, of course. Color of mud. But charming, dear boy. Charming. You know the penalty for touching an Indian. Now, now, Pedro. You know orders don't apply to a cockroach like me. - Did she hit you? - Oh, no. WeWe were just out here, under the trees... when suddenly two men I could swear they were Castilians came right through the wall of the temple and not a door in sight. - Just ran right out and hit me. - Two men. Who were they? I was paying no attention. Trying to save her soul I was, may the saints credit it to me. - Well, did you see which way the men went? - Yes. That way. The devil's curse on them. Oh, my poor head. - The road to Villa Rica and the coast. - And welcome they are to it. You won't tell on me, Pedro, lad? No, not a word. - Not a word out of you either. - No. - Can you make it home all right? - I think so. And the upshot of it is that we sail at dawn. We could stand more water and supplies. It's a long stretch to Cuba. Believe me, gentlemen. A lame goat takes no siesta. If something's to be done, do it. - Right. Then we sail with the dawn wind. - Now listen, men. You all know that everyone who follows Cortez... is going to be in great trouble with the governor of Cuba. Especially when he finds out that Cortez is... planning to cheat him out of his share of the treasure... turn it all over to His Majesty, the ruler of Spain. Our only chance is to get back to Cuba now... tell the governor what's going on here... let him see we're his friends... and get our reward. Corio, this is the wisest decision you've ever made. - You've got the gems with you. - Unfortunately, no. No? What about the secret door to the temple? Pedro de Vargas was on guard, and we couldn't get him away from his post. We even got his friend Juan Garcia drunk and sent for him... - but hehe wouldn't budge. - We didn't want to risk the whole project for a few trinkets. What difference does it make anyway, as long as we get the whole cargo in the end? Just this: The governor of Cuba will get it, not us. Don't worry about your share, Corio. I'll see that every man on this ship gets a double share. Ho! What are you doing there? Who is this man? I caught him eavesdropping! Pedro de Vargas. Let me have the handling of him! Before you let these men kill me, ask them to tell you... what they did with the gems they took from the treasure chest tonight. - Stand aside. - Hold your tongue! - What did you say, de Vargas? - Trust one of Cortez's spies to lie. Wait a minute! What makes you say they got the gems? Because they did get me to leave my post. Because the gems were taken while I was gone. And because the secret door was left partly open. By my soul. And you talk about liars. We'll have every stitch off of them! Curse you for a hothead, Corio. Didn't you ever hear of a joke? Cermeno and I were only jesting. Thought we'd surprise you later, before we arrived in Cuba. Sure enough. The gems. - You were right, de Vargas. - Thank you, sir. What are you going to do with them? I'm placing the gems in this chest. Everybody bear witness to that. Look, gentlemen. I now throw the key into the water. The character of the sea is above suspicion. Chain him. De Vargas. - De Vargas. - What do you want? It's me. How much would it be worth to Cortez if this ship does not sail for Cuba? A thousand ducats for you. The gems in that chest are worth 50 times that. - There's no market in Cuba for jewels like those. - Huh? Who would you sell them to? Escudero's the man who'd get rich. He already has the ear of the governor. Even as a friend, he's proven how much you can depend on him. I'm not in this for my health. I'm tired of songs and promises. What security have I that Cortez will pay? - You've heard of my father? - Yes. I swear on his honor that I'll show you the way to Cortez's favor. Agreed. I'll get the chains off you. If we can delay the sailing by an hour, we'll have them. Good. Here. - We'll take the gems with us. - There's no time for us to break open the safe. We won't have to. I threw away the wrong key. Vaya! Lucky mistake. Wasn't it? Here. You keep them. They're pretty, but useless to a poor man. That was a good point of yours no market. - You get in the boat. - Right. Alarm! Alarm! It's de Vargas! He's escaped! De Vargas has escaped! Chepito, Tobal, fetch your crossbows. Look alive! Don't miss. Don't miss. Hurry, Father. Hurry. God forgive me. It's my own fault. It's a wonder I don't take my cursed life. We'll discuss that later. How is he? I'm glad you got here, Your Mercy. I'm afraid the good youth is beyond human skill. He's bleeding to death. What a pity to see him drain out like a stuck pig. Then hitch up your britches, man, and stop the bleeding. You should have done that at once! He's weak from the labors of the night. Now, hold me excused, Your Mercy, if he dies of shock. Hold you excused? If he dies, you'll have me to reckon with. You mean he's going to die? I'll do the best I can for him, but it's a poor chance. Heaven pity him. Well, heaven pity you if anything happens to him. Strip off his shirt. He'll be cooler for it. Probably won't need it again anyway. Rip it down the front. It'll be easier to get off. No, don't tear it. Put it aside. I'll roll you dice for it after. You pig!You'd cast lots on a dying man's belly for his shroud! Hey, not so fast. We haven't finished with you yet. What are you gonna do? Why are you gonna burn me? Have mercy. Where's Juan? Juan. I'm here, lad. Lie back. Easy. Don't you understand, boy? It's this or bleed to death. Hold him. He's gotta be perfectly quiet. Get hold of his legs. - Sit on his middle. - Help me, someone. Someone help me. He doesn't know what he's talking about. He's rambling. It's a bad sign. Your Mercy, get hold of his throat. Hold his head still. Otherwise he'll jerk. Be careful, Botello. If you miss, I'll cut your heart out. Look at him. Look at him. Well, it's as I feared, but you wouldn't be warned. Even my skill can't defeat the will of God. But I've stopped the bleeding. You'll have to admit it's a well-seared wound. No. He's breathing. It's true. His heart still beats. Well, why not? In the practice of true science, God often lends a hand. You may think that anyone can lay a hot iron on an open wound. Far from it. It has to be timed to the very split of a second. Had I removed the iron too soon, the wound would not have seared. Had I applied it just a moment longer... the patient would most certainly have died. Be quiet and hand me that liquor. This native dose would raise the dead. He'll be all right now, unless he should die of weakness, which is in God's hands. - How is he? - Asleep, sir. - No. No, I'm not. - Stay where you are. You. Tell me one thing. How much pulque did you drink the other night? - Uh, two gallons, Captain, on my honor. - Liar. Well, maybe it was three, judging from the weight of my head. De Vargas... Corio told me what happened on the ship. Is it true you promised I'd pay him 500 ducats? No, sir. I told him that you'd give him a thousand. Hmm. Very well. I accept the debt. But he'll have to wait like the rest of us... - till the end of our venture. - Thank you, sir. Oh. About your leaving camp contrary to orders. I'll be frank with you. If you'd failed, I'd have hanged you. But since you succeeded, I herewith promote you to the rank of captain. Me? Captain? I daresay your father will be glad when he hears of this. Yes, sir. You made a lucky stroke, Captain de Vargas. Those men on the Gallega were attempting to escape to Cuba... to get the aid of Governor Velzquez. Had they succeeded, they would have defeated this expedition... destroyed everything we fought for. Where there's one traitor, there are apt to be two. And we face a repetition of that same danger as long as we have ships waiting for us. But, sir, those ships are our only means of communication and and retreat. If one can't retreat, he must go forward. If we survive this expedition, gentlemen... the order I have given to destroy this armada... will go down in history as a monument to our resolution and courage. If we fail, it doesn't matter, as history will forget us. Sir, this is not an attack. It's a peaceful mission. - How do you know, de Vargas? Maybe it's a trick. - No. It's another ambassador. Why waste words on these unpredictable savages? We'll hear what they have to say and see what they've brought to offer. All right. Hold your fire. But watch me. If these devils make one false move, we'll cut 'em down to the last man. - Get Doa Marina. - Yes, sir. Never mind. Here she is. Once more we have need of your precious voice. Yes, milord. Doa Marina, find out who honors us in this royal manner. Yes, milord. Who is this? Moctezuma? No, milord. It is Cacamatzin... nephew and first councillor of the great emperor Moctezuma. Indeed! Well! Say to the royal ambassador that I am pleased to welcome him to my camp. Will you come, my lord? Milord, the Emperor Moctezuma send these gifts... and ask how long you propose to favor his country with your presence. Tell the royal prince that depends upon... the Emperor Moctezuma's hospitality and wisdom. Yes, milord. Milord, the royal prince says his gods are all-powerful. They threaten to bring drought, pestilence and war if you remain. - Captain Alvarado. - Yes, sir. Train your cannon on that heathen idol and fire when ready. - Yes, sir. - Tell the royal prince to watch closely... and see which is the more powerful, his gods or my cannon. - Ready! Fire! Now, Seor Cacamatzin... tell your uncle, the emperor, how helpless your gods are before us. Father, I count my chances in purgatory improved by this temple cleaning. When the time comes for idols to fall, they fall of themselves. Get a detail of men. Take charge of the treasure. - Yes, sir. - Milord... the royal prince says now your only hope of escape... is to turn back and leave this country at once. Leave the country? Impossible. We have no ships. He says 18 ships have just arrived at Villa Rica. Eighteen ships at Villa Rica? - That means a thousand men. - Cannon and horses. Thank the royal prince for this very welcome news. Our supplies and reinforcements have arrived sooner than expected. - Yes, milord. - Now, by heaven, we've got them where we want 'em. Don't be a fool. Those ships come from Cuba, not Spain. Governor Velzquez is not a man to sit idly by while there's gold to be had. He's come to hang us from a yardarm. This royal prince knows more than he's telling. We must act at once. Divide our force, leave half here, march with the rest to Villa Rica. - Villa Rica? - It's a hard choice, but it's one thing or the other. Stay here and we're caught between Governor Velzquez on one side... and a million savages on the other. - Doa Marina. - Yes, milord. Inform the royal prince it will be necessary for five of his chieftains to remain here... - as a guarantee that there will be no violence while I am gone. - Yes, milord. - Captain Sandoval. - Yes, sir. - Prepare to march immediately. - Yes, sir. - De Vargas. - Yes, sir. You will be captain of the guard. Prepare quarters for the prisoners. - See they do not leave this camp. - Yes, sir. - Doa Marina. - Yes, milord. Tell Seor Cacamatzin that we take our leave in all respect and friendship. Yes, milord. All quiet? All quiet. Too quiet, if you ask me. Regular hurricane weather. Makes you feel like something was hanging over us. Listen. There it goes again. They're a pretty big pack if they rise. There's still enough of us to handle them. I wonder. Why don't you get some rest, amigo? You've been in your boots a straight 30 hours. I want to have a look around first. Hasta la vista. Hasta la vista. - Seor. - Yes? Will you speak to me, Seor Pedro? Seor, I know you, but you not know me. Me Coatl. Coatl! Why didn't you speak to me? Seor Pedro Castilian. I hate Castilians. But you and I are friends, Coatl. I think of that, seor. I think of what you do for me in Spain. I think I speak to you now... maybe I understand better why you come here. This is my country, seor. These my people, my gods. We not come tell you to stop loving your gods. We not come make you slaves. Why you do this, seor? Well, I'm afraid I haven't any answer for that. It isn't right for men to worship idols. There's only one true God. Maybe your god and my god same god. Maybe we just call them by different names. Perhaps. But we're not enemies, you and I. I give my life for you, seor... but you hurt my people, I fight you. I can understand that. I suppose that... if I were in your place, I'd do the same. Be still. I've got to get around this ear. Careful now. Remember, I'm ticklish. By my soul, I'd rather clip a horse. You've been singin' all morning. Why? - I feel like singing. - Why? What a picture. It's a good thing I'm not jealous. Don't rattle her, Brother Pedro. This is a critical moment. And if she cuts me Seor, you must get some rest. Oh, those drums. If only they'd stop. They'll never stop. Here's a wench for the New World, Brother Pedro. Bless me if I know which of you I love best. Catana, if he ever breaks your heart and goes chasing after some fancy lady, I'll You'll what? I don't know. I guess it would break my heart too. My poor seor. Four days without sleep. Go to sleep, my seor. Go to sleep. Oh, my seor, I love you. I love you so much it hurts. Juan. Does he still love her a great deal? - Who? - The Lady Luisa. No, tell me truly. I want the truth. I don't know. Perhaps as a cavalier loves his lady. He took a pledge to serve her, whatever that means. I wouldn't understand. But I understand. Let him love her if he wants to. But I shall bear him his first son. Catana! That's what I'm so happy about. Does he know? No, not yet. It's a secret. But isn't it wonderful? Yes. I've been very wicked all my life, Juan. It's hard for a girl without parents to be good. Maybe that's why our Lord has not held it against me has been so kind. You don't think he'd take it out on my baby, do you? - Take what out? - My sins. Oh, Catana. My baby is innocent. Besides, he will be the son of Pedro de Vargas... and the grandson of Don Francisco de Vargas. To think that I shall be his mother I, Catana Perez, of the Rosario. We'll name him Francisco. No, of course not. I forgot. His father would not want to give his name to... my son. But I'll bring him up properly. He'll be smart too. Perhaps he'll be a priest, maybe a bishop. Why not? Think of it. My son a bishop. Oh, my darling... I want him to have everything I never had. But all I can give him is my love for you. Oh, seor, seor. I love you, I love you, I love you. It's Cortez back from Villa Rica! Wake up, Pedro! - Don't wake him up! - The whole army's with him. Must be more than 100 horses. - Quick, Pedro, get up, get up! - You can't wake him up. He's captain of the guard. He's gotta go out to meet Cortez. Quick, your sword, Pedro. - Captain de Vargas. - Yes, sir. - My congratulations, sir. - Now the governor of Cuba will have ample evidence... of what my intentions are and be convinced that I'm the leader of this expedition. Come with me. I want to see all my captains in my quarters immediately! - Congratulations, sir. - Thank you. God! By my soul, Botello! - Where did you get that hat? - Pretty, isn't it? Oh How did it go? Well, I'll tell you. The credit in history will go to Cortez... but I shiver to think what would have happened... had I not been there to guide him by the stars. There we were, facing an army of Cubans and Basques. Every man with the lust of gold in his heart. Juan, what's the matter? Are you sick? Let loose of me, you dog! Let loose of me! Captain Cortez! Captain Cortez! Mother of God! Why do you stop me? But for you this dog would have been splattered against that house! - Pedro. - What is it, Father? Pedro, may God give you strength in this... your hour of greatest need, to keep your vow. Of course, Father, I intend to. Repeat that vow, Pedro. As you hope for salvation, repeat it now. That you should attempt to kill Seor de Silva, an emissary of His Majesty... by whose help the victory at Cempoala was ours. That manThat swine put my mother on the rack... tortured her until she prayed for death. That man is a fugitive from justice a murderer a matricide. He strangled his own mother. In the name of the Santa Hermandad, I demand that he be placed under arrest. Yes, I did it killed my own mother to keep this dog and his henchmen from burning her alive at the stake. While she was dying she blessed me for it. - Captain Sandoval. - Yes, sir. Put this man in irons and take him away. We'll hear his case in due time. A thousand pardons, Seor de Silva, for this regrettable incident. The man shall pay for it, I assure you. Put your faith in Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. In him you will find strength. Just a moment, Captain Cortez. Here is another man who carries in his mind... - a grievance against me Pedro de Vargas ofJan. - Pedro de Vargas? He's a gallant soldier. He's won promotion in my company. It distresses me to bother you with these personal matters... but de Vargas has already made one attempt upon my life. I have no doubt his grievance will be increased... when he learns that I have married the lady of his choice the Lady Luisa de Carvajal. Seor de Silva has come to us as an emissary of His Majesty... and as my personal guest. Under the circumstances, Captain de Vargas... I shall hold you personally responsible for his safety. If any harm comes to him... the penalty will be nothing less than death... by hanging. Come with me, Seor de Silva. Forget your vow and God will forget you. Seor. Pedro. Catana. Moctezuma's city is no ripe plum ready to fall into our laps, gentlemen. It will require a deal of cultivation. But thanks to our victory at Cempoala, we'll soon be ready for the harvesting. But of our plans, more later. You left His Majesty well, seor? In excellent health, Captain Cortez... but deeply concerned for the safety and well-being of this company. How concerned, seor? His Majesty is convinced that the seeds of heresy are everywhere... and that they need investigation in this new land as well as in Spain. He especially enjoined me as supremo of the Santa Hermandad, to look into the matter. You would bring the Santa Hermandad here? There was a letter, Captain Cortez an order of arrest sent by me concerning a certain heretic in this company. - It remains unanswered. - I know of no such letter. - It's possible for a letter to be lost. - Or stolen. However, it's of no consequence. I myself shall hold an examination. Have you ever attended an examination of the Santa Hermandad, Captain? - No, I have not. - It's a valuable experience. I remember one examination of a supposedly honorable family ofJan. One would have thought them above suspicion... though the evil treachery of the father and son became clear enough later. There was, I believe, a girl of about 12, outwardly very fair and innocent looking... but so deeply had the detested roots ofheresy been implanted even in this child... that she refused to bear witness against her parents... and it was necessary to hoist her onto the strappado where she was Murdered. I compliment you on a noble feat the death of a 12-year-old child. Who spoke of a feat, Captain? A stroke of policy perhaps, but A stroke of inhuman fiendishness. Careful, seor. I'm His Majesty's emissary. Do you take refuge behind that? Refuge? Yes, refuge! Or have you the stomach to meet me man to man? If not, then without picking words, I'll ask you, who's the coward here? And the time and place of this meeting? - Here and now. - You, sir! Do you forget where you are? You dare draw your sword at my table? But, sir, the family this man speaks of is my family. The murdered girl was my sister. I am not concerned with private feuds. I thought I made it clear we'll have no brawling! Are you a soldier, Captain de Vargas? If not, hand me your sword. Sir, do you realize what this man represents? With him, the Santa Hermandad with all its evils has come to the New World. A kingdom within a kingdom. A despotism so strong, so powerful... that it paralyzes the human soul with terror. Already he speaks of the strappado and tortured children. That will do, de Vargas. We have no need of oratory here. This is not oratory, Captain Cortez. That man is a fiend without honor, an assassin of infants. Captain Cortez, may I remind you... that this man is a criminal under sentence of death in Spain. I crossed the ocean in behalf of His Majesty's affairs... not to die at the hands of a fugitive who'd so greatly benefit by my death. My life, valueless as it may be, is your responsibility. A thousand pardons for this regrettable incident at my dinner table. However, I must make one thing clear. The charges you have made against a loyal officer of my company carry no weight here. Those are matters for an ecclesiastical court... and the testimony of witnesses, and we have neither the one nor the other. Father Bartolom is in charge of the spiritual interests of this enterprise. And as long as he vouches for Captain de Vargas, that is enough for me. I must ask you to accept those terms, or return to the coast. I accept the terms. But will Pedro de Vargas abide by them? My word on it. Doa Marina, will you entertain my guests? I have some matters of state to discuss with Seor de Silva. Yes, milord. - Captain de Vargas. - Yes, sir. If it is necessary to teach 20 rebels the lesson of discipline... that lesson will be taught. Carry that thought with you. Who is it? - Father, help me. Help me! - Hup. Father, they arrested Pedro. Diego de Silva has been murdered. No. No, Father. It isn't dying that matters. I've faced death many times. But it's leaving you. What's going to become of you, my beloved? I shall die too. No. You must live. You must live for our son... who hasn't yet been born. Oh, Catana, how are you ever going to tell him that his father was hanged? You must go back to my father and mother in Italy. They'll take care of you. But promise me that you'll never tell them how I died. My father's a soldier. If I died in battle, he'd he'd grieve for me, yes... but he'd be proud too. But to be hanged... and for a crime I didn't commit. Deliver us, O mercifulJesus... from that place of darkness and torture... and receive us into thy paternal bosom, there to love - Padre. - And praise and glorify. - Padre? - Yes, my son? - Seor Pedro die at dawn? - That is the verdict. Seor Pedro not kill de Silva. Seor Pedro my friend. - I know who kill de Silva. - Yes? Go on. You Christian priest. I tell you, you not let Seor Pedro die? In God's name, man, speak. In a few minutes a man is going to his death. If you know who killed Diego de Silva, it is your duty to save Pedro now. I kill de Silva. Me, Coatl. - God's will be done. - Yes, Padre. Guard! They're coming. Kiss me good-bye now. Let me hold you close for this last minute. Guard!Guard, unlock the prison door. Good-bye, my love. Only I know it isn't good-bye. Pedro, you kept your vow and God didn't desert you. - You're free. - Free? I've killed him! - Take her away. - No! Let me go! How you must have pained our Lord's heart and that ofhis holy Mother. It is wrong even to contemplate... the taking of a life, your own as well as another's. God is the giver of life. God alone can be the taker. The sin is all the greater... since God has placed an unborn soul in your keeping. But our Lord has a compassionate heart. He has mercifully ordained that Pedro will live. You have been blessed, my child, beyond most women in being given a second chance. May you walk in the light of that knowledge all the days of your life. Captain de Vargas reporting, sir. Sandoval reporting, sir. Everything ready to move as planned, sir. Gentlemen, this time last year we were fighting mosquitoes in swamps... accepting paltry gifts and half starving. But now, we stand knocking at the very door of the great emperor Moctezuma. We shall meet His Majesty face to face, have done with ambassadors and specks of gold. This, gentlemen, is just the beginning. De Vargas, order the first detachment ready to move forward. - Yes, sir. - Gentlemen, be ready to march. Yes, sir. I charge you, put this greed for gold out of your hearts. Open your eyes to what lies before you. Go forward not as conquerors, but as men of God! The sun shines here as fair as in Spain. Let it shine on all men alike. Here there shall be neither master nor slave... no looking up nor looking down... but here all men shall be equal, according to God's plan. The Lord has indeed blessed this land. In its richness it may yet outvalue all the gold of Moctezuma. And in God's own time... it will blossom forth under the cross of Christianity... a haven for the weak, a refuge for the strong... with all the good of the Old World and none of its ills. Before this venture is concluded, gentlemen... we will taste thejoys of victory... or the bitterness of defeat. Many will die in the days that lie ahead... but those who survive will one day return to their homeland... rich in wisdom and gold, exonerated by His Majesty... and forever secure in the knowledge... that they have participated in the opening of a new world.
