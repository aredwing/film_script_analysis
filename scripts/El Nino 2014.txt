Blue BMW, as before. Got it. Eva. - Do you copy? - Yes - Say something. - Fix your car, arsehole. Why not something nice? Here he comes. Let's go. Stick close behind me. Fucking car! No trip to the brothel today. He must be tired of that Russian chick. Irina. Her name's Irina and she's Ukrainian. Irina. Right. I see you did your homework. All in the line of duty. He's going around again. I'll have to turn off. OK. You take over. OK. Take over. Now. OK, I'm going. He's headed for La Lnea. Stick close to him. He's being careful, maybe we'll get lucky. He's driving into Gibraltar. - What now? - Follow him. Hello. Stop. Got your ID? What? That's UK territory, it's out of our jurisdiction. But we can do a little sightseeing. Thank you. I'll stay here. I'll wait down there. Pull over to that side for a border security check. Go through again. I don't know what it could be. Hurry, we can't keep him long. Yes, I know. There. All done. T- M-O-U 7-0-2-6-6-2-3 5-8-J-3 This is the one. Scan it. What do we do with the Englishman? Nothing. We have a warrant. We could ask for extradition. For a Brit with no record, resident in the UK? Because this is the UK. We can't get at him and he knows that. So we just let him screw us over? Let's see what happens first. It's clean, guys. - It can't be. - It is. What's on the invoice? Frozen fish. Three tonnes. We have to open it up. The coke is inside. What? Sometimes things don't show up on the scan. And we have to pay for a container. - Do you know how expensive fish is? - For fuck's sake. Hold on a sec. Hold it. Come on, we've got the guy, the recordings, the container... What else do you want? We've waited two years for this. He must have found out. Nobody else knew about it. Just you and me. And I trust you. You could at least say the same. It was that bastard. That fucking Englishman's screwed us over again. Compi! There's some blonde bird here to see you! - What's up, dude? - Do you fancy a ride? I can't, mate. I'm working. So am I. I'm testing this thing out. If I go, my uncle will kill me. Hey, Antonio! What are you doing? Just a minute, man. I'm talking! Look, stop gassing, and come back and do some work! Come on, Compi. Come and try it out. Where are you going? Look! - What is it? - A stone from Africa. You went all the way there just for this? You're nuts, dude. Look. This place was empty two years ago. Now look at it: Germans, Swiss, Swedes... - Every nutcase in Europe. - But they've got plenty of dough. Imagine how much money that guy makes. What with the boards, the beers... - The German's onto a good thing. - A fucking awesome set-up. This was all here already, that guy just saw the opportunity. We should do the same. Set up a bar here? Fuck no, not here. Remember that little beach down off Punta Paloma way? We could put a hippy beach bar like this there. Grungy but cool. Grungy but cool? Shitty-looking, but with everything: a place to watch the sun set, nice cold beer, hot babes hanging around all day long. It's there, Nio If we don't do it, someone else will. I reckon I've got about 200 in the bank, so it would be shitty for sure. There's a lot of money to be made around here. You just have to want it. Want what? To earn it. You know what I mean. Yeah, you express yourself so well. - What are we doing here, Compi? - Let me handle it. He's cool. That's him. - Him? But he's Arab. - No, he's not. But I'm telling you. He's Spanish. I saw his ID when we did a line in a club. They sneak over as kids. After a while they become Spanish. Gave you his life story, did he? I don't want hassle. What hassle? He's in your line of work. You fucking shithead. Dude, they don't know us from shit. I thought you knew him. Yeah, but this is business. You can look now. OK, here it is. We need a double bottom, using part of the tank. And you hide the stuff in there, out of sight. But the boat has to look brand new. Is that a problem? No, no problem at all. What do you think, Nio? OK. I need tools and materials, and it will take time. Two days? Three or four. Especially if we go around in circles like that every day. I told you. He notices everything. He can do it blindfolded. He is the best, I'm telling you. He's been at that workshop for four years. Plenty of yachts and rich guys, yet they pay him jack shit. Who said you could look around? I'm here with Halil. Didn't he explain what the job is? I've never seen one like this. Well, forget you ever saw it. And forget the job. Get out of here, both of you! Out! Hey! What's wrong? Just take it easy. What did you do? I was just looking. Well, you fucked it up. Shut your fucking mouth. Come here. Is what Halil tells me true? I don't know. I didn't understand shit. You crossed the Strait just to get a stone from Africa? So what? Was it yours? I can give it back to you. So that's why you're called Nio. Because you like to play. I don't like being bored. Listen, if we come to an agreement, you definitely won't be bored. My name is Rachid. Come on, let's go talk. OK, calm down. I'm not doing anything. No. We can't use it. We can't tie him to the body. We don't actually think he ordered the killing. The Englishman has never done anything like this. He's working for other people. - Which people? - Eastern Europeans. Marking out their patch. Demand there has skyrocketed. They're tapping all dealers, even hash smugglers. I see. This is a warning to everyone. Cocaine is not like hash. They won't accept mistakes. The trouble is, we can't afford to make any mistakes either. They're calling for someone's head too. There's an opening in Tarragona. Tarragona? If you think about it, it would be like a promotion for you. You don't have a family to move or anything. I know, lucky me. Don't hate me for this, but it may be for the best. You've pissed off a lot of criminals. Some of them have it in for you. You can't live like that, constantly under threat. - That's my business. - And mine. A headless corpse hanging off a bridge? It's not torching a car or spraying a door. These people are different. But we're so close! We're so close! Now we know it's him, we can catch him. It's just a matter of time. Time we don't have because of that picture. Give them a different picture: a press conference with a ton of cocaine piled up behind us. Three months. Three months? I'll bring you his head on a platter. I don't know. I don't know. We could hide you for a while. Hey... You liked flying, didn't you? In that case, you can take to the sky again. And Eva stays on our job. Eva stays. And why do you need to go to Seville? It's not me, it's him. He needs my help to get a job. You're the one without a job, not him. If you get it, will you move to Seville? I really don't know. See? I need to push him. He doesn't normally need pushing. Once he's got what he wants, he doesn't even remember your name. Ask Susi. And not just Susi. There's Reyes, Carol... Hey, all right, we get it. We'll come straight back, don't worry. We'll be back in two days, you'll see. Look, do whatever you want. You always do anyway. Hey, where are you going? To dance. Is that OK? Give you two lovebirds some space. Don't be like that, babes. She's pissed off. Small wonder, with a story like that. What a crock of shit. What else could I say? We're going to Morocco for weed? Her dad's a cop, for fuck's sake! I'm not sure about this, Compi. About what? Some guy offers you a few lines of coke, then suddenly he's asking you to do this. Do you think they put ads in the paper? "Wanted: nitwits to cross the Strait," "with the cops in hot pursuit. " I don't think so. So if the cops or customs show up, we toss it overboard. In Spain, no weed means no jail. Hear that, Nio? Spain is a great place to live. Anyway, if Rachid says you can go, then it means he's paid the cops off. All you have to do is follow this. Hey! The cops are here! Relax. They're friends. Friends? As long as they get their share. No, that one goes over there. What does it matter? Each package has an owner, they're marked. This is ngel-3-Sierra. Ready to depart from the platform. Great! You just got here and you're already pissing me off. You were late so I took your seat. How long for? Until your punishment's over? - Are we energised? - Yes. OK, breaker on. Why couldn't they have punished Eva? We'd give her a ride for free. She's out of your league. Give over, Fish Face. Don't you feel embarrassed depriving all those kids of fish fingers? Arsehole. I can't believe you defrosted three tonnes of hake for nothing! Captain Birds Eye! That's a good one. There's your new nickname. Captain Birds Eye. Is he always like this? Does he ever shut up? That's why I'm so knackered. So where shall we go? Towards Tarifa, see if we get lucky. OK, here we go. ngel-3-Sierra, we're airborne. Transponder code 7000. Request operational flight. You're clear to fly. They just left. I've got something six miles ahead. Can you check it, Sergio? I'm on it. There it is. Over there. Let's see. It's an inflatable. It's leaving one hell of a wake. Lucky Captain Birds Eye. Here we go. You still remember what to do? Hit the gas, Nio! That's it, Nio! 12,000 when we get back. Can you believe it? This is awesome... Stop your engines immediately and wait to be boarded. All paid off, my arse! I'll kill that buddy of yours. They don't give a fuck. Son of a bitch. Press them a little. Now you're talking. Why don't you stop, mate? What are you doing? We have to dump it! Sit down! Sit down! You just wait and see what happens... We have to dump it! Sit down! They look like they've smoked a whole bundle themselves. Don't you think? Stop! Stop! They're not stopping. Shall we play cat and mouse with them? - Now you're talking. - Let's go. You're enjoying yourself. It's like riding a bike. Where are they? No idea, but I think I've shit myself. Son of a bitch! I'm sure of it now. Of what? That I've definitely shit myself. That scared them. See that? Eyes like saucers. And again. Wait, wait! Hold on! Slow down! This isn't PlayStation! We're risking our lives here! Son of a bitch! Did you see that? - I told you they were stoned. - He's a kamikaze. Shit, they're coming back again. He's heading back to Morocco. What now? Stay on their arse or what? They might break down. If not, we go aboard and kick arse. Like the good old days. Don't you have the balls? No, not me. - But you do. - Who? Me? Don't you have the balls? It's like riding a bike. This bike has training wheels, like my grandson's. You can both fuck off. Come on, take her down. I think we upset him. Jess, if I die, don't forget you're godfather to my daughter. Yes. He's her godfather? She's 19 years old, he's never given her a present. Are you going in or what? OK, but take her down a bit. A bit more! I'm handing myself in... Give it a rest! Cut the engines! This is fucking serious, Nio. Will you stop? He's got a gun! Get lower! I can't Go the fuck up! What're you doing? Heading back. We're in Morocco. I was about to jump! Yeah, sure you were. We psyched them out, Nio! Fuck you, arseholes! Yeah, especially you! "I'm handing myself in. " Anyone can have a moment of weakness. Nio, you fucked them up! You've got balls! If those cops find out we're in Spain... Perejil Island is Spanish, isn't it? It's really cold! It doesn't work in here. We wait until dark and then go. Well, if we have to wait... What are you doing? What do you think? I doubt Rachid will care if we score some hash off him. Dude, what the fuck is this? It's full of sand! What? See for yourself. Fucking hell. The bastard! Is that sand too? You fucking piece of Moroccan shit. What's up with you? What's up, man? Look what I brought for you! Do you like it? Stop! Stop! You knew about this! - I'm sorry! - Do you like sand? Does it taste good? Well? Does it or doesn't it? Look, I'm sorry! You will be if your boss doesn't pay us what he said. Geit in. Open the glove box. 12,000. And that's it? You did your part, and we did ours. What do you mean? You lied to us, we risked our necks for nothing. Do you think I'm stupid? I guess while the cops were on us, you got the other boat through. I was surprised you didn't throw the cargo into the sea. So... Now we're quits. Wait. When do we go again? It went fucking well, right? You're no good as bait anymore. And for the real work, you need brains more than balls. Nio... My car's down there, if you need a ride. You tell Rachid this is no way to do things. Nio! How is the girl getting on? Not bad. She missed you, right? She fills you in every day. We spent two years on it, so this is strange for her. Can't you bust any of them? Only the ones at them bottom. We want to bust the ringleaders. You'll never catch them, Jess. Everyone knows that. You're a dreamer, Jess, you think you can fix everything with wire taps and surveillance, but after you get so far, wham! They knock you back down. Yeah, I must be a slow leaner. That's why I never went into all that. I just like doing my job, going out and catching bad guys. If I get rid of a couple, I go to bed happy. And even if I don't, I still sleep like a baby. I used to like going to bed. I hardly get any sleep now. What? So you are fucking her? At it every night, like rabbits? Have you broken the bed? Give me details! One day I'll record you and send it to your wife. - That'll teach you. - Yeah, right. Here, take this. For Mara, from her godfather. I was only joking about that. I know, but you were right. I tell you what: when she's back home on holiday, you give it to her. - She'll like that. - OK. But one thing: I don't want you as a son-in-law. - Are you crazy? - I'm joking! You're sick. Nio, stop looking at it, you'll wear it out. Yes, boss, OK. What's this? I'm sick of taking the bus. I want to show you something. Pretty cool, huh? Yeah! See that white one there? Which? The one with the sign. See it? That's the one. Leaving your grandma's? I can't have Mari Fe over there. I knew she'd get to you. I couldn't say no. She wouldn't even talk to me for a week. She didn't buy that Seville thing. I suggested living together, to see her reaction, and she said yes. And her dad? Her dad's like me. He does whatever she says. But I imagine he's not happy. Suit yourself, but this is a shithole. A shithole? It's great, it's got the see... Yeah, and all the rats that have been living there for 20 years. Shit, Nio, you're putting me off it now. What's that guy doing here? I met him again the other day. Fuck! Hey, wait up. We're going into business together. With him? Are you nuts? He's sick of working for that Arab. Hey, wait up. Dude, wait up. Look, wait, man. Think about it. Right now, we've got cash. You've still got yours, no? What I have left plus Halil's... Halil wants in? He's all in, dude, and not just with cash. He has the knowledge. He knows where we can buy hash and who to sell it to. - See what I mean? - Move! What? Now you're pissed off? Fine! Every man for himself. We need to hit the streets. You go to bed early. If you're late, your boss will kill you. Give me yours, Compi. Damn, you're disgusting. It's so I don't lose it. Buy a wallet like normal people. If you don't want it... It's OK. Hey! There's only 2,000. Is the rest stuck to your balls? It went on the bike and the flat. Two grand and my five will get us jack shit. Put me in for ten. Fucking hell! Sweet! See? I told you he was all in. Hand it over. That's enough for 20 kg of pollen. That fits in a backpack. Some nut on a jet ski with a backpack. They won't notice. How much is it worth in Spain? 2,000, if it's good. 2,000 times 20 is... Not that much, is it? How do all great journeys start? With one small step. Get the fuck out of here! One small step! Whatever! It's a saying. A saying from your country? You can keep it. Wow, man, this is beautiful. Stop the car! Bloody hell... It's beautiful! You bought a camera too? No, it's Mari Fe's dad's. Make sure the cops don't see that tape. You hear that? The drums of Ketama. The nicest music in the world. It's beautiful. This is the pollen. There's not much of it. Of course not. 100 kilos of weed equal one kilo of pollen. Keep banging the drums, guys. Dude, this one is taller than me! Come back before you get dizzy. This is fucking paradise, dude. How can they forbid something so beautiful? Put the camera away. We don't want trouble. In two days, the pollen will be in Ttouan. Why not at the beach? If we can't pay the cops off, they won't do it. So you'll bring it down? Who? Me? I can't. If Rachid finds out, he'll cut my balls off. I can't. Who will do it then? Him? This is fucking beautiful! Like fucking paradise, dude! It has to be a local. Someone we can trust. It's your call, Halil. I'm going to ask somebody. She's already gone through. We have to go into Ceuta. She gets through a lot of nappies! No, she's paid to bring them. They all are. Even chocolate milk? They have nothing. In Europe, we have it all. Morocco has high taxes. That's why they come here. They're taking the truck tyres. I wonder how they get the rest of it. Once they're across, they get back in line to do it again? That's their job. Every day. Shit. There she is! That's my sister. Amina! Amina! Amina! His sister's hot, isn't she? Better looking than her brother. I think he must be adopted. For sure. Did she catch you filming her? I think so. No problem. My sister is cool with it. Halil, I don't understand Arabic, but she didn't sound very happy. Family stuff. But she agrees to it? I already told you she does. I don't want to be stood up. My sister's crazy, but you can trust her. She needs the money. She's all alone. What about you? I hadn't seen her for two years. Not me, my siblings or my parents. She got divorced and wouldn't come home. She's always been proud, and she won't find a husband here. The second-hand market not so good here? Not if you're as stubborn as her. At home, she was always shouting and arguing. She never learned. So now she's bringing in packages. Come closer! I can't! It's too rocky! You come! Next time, pick it up one the shore, arsehole. Shit, look at all that. Must be at least 3,000 kilos. At the very least. Where are the Civil Guard? On their way. But in two minutes, this will be over. What shall we do? Bring her down. Otherwise we'll lose them. All right, then. The cops are here! We can't unload all the gear. If you come back empty-handed, I'll slit your throat. You hear me? Hurry up! Damn it! Go, go, go! Over here, damn it! Don't move! You make us work for this. Halil! Listen, your friend can't speak to you right now. Because I'm about to beat the shit out of him! You hear me? He had no choice but to crawl into a sewer pipe full of shit. The cop shouts into the pipe: I'll wait as long as I have to, then I'll kill you. How long did he wait? The cop? Like, ten minutes. And Halil? Two days. We looked everywhere, we couldn't find him. He must've been scared shitless. He thought every cop in Spain was coming after him. But he's OK? Yeah. Except for the smell. Though it's not the sewer smell. It's all the aftershave he's been using to cover it up. I think you had better be going. That's too bad, because I really like it here. You'd get 14 years for this. This isn't Spain. Would you visit me in jail? It's no joke. But would you come or not? I barely even know you. We can soon fix that. How about I come back tomorrow? There's no shipment tomorrow. Exactly. If the cops aren't after us, we'll have more time to talk. It's not a good idea. Well, I'll be here tomorrow anyway. What if I wear loads of aftershave? A present for you. Here's the Englishman. Find out who this guy is. He met the Englishman today. That's what he came for. The Englishman gave him the case and then he got on the afternoon flight to London. How long have you been following the Englishman around Gibraltar? No pain no gain, right? Amina! What are you doing here? I left the jet ski at Marina Smir. Let's go for a ride. I don't want to be seen with you. Am I that ugly? If the police find out and we don't pay them, it's over. First they'll beat me up then they'll throw me in jail. Will you come to visit me in jail? Hey, Nio. At the port, in an hour. There's a bus stop by the entrance. Hold this for me. So, how about a drink? Come on, then. I reckon he does the same as us. And not just him. There's a lot of money here. Can't they be rich without being crooks? I don't know, maybe, but I don't think so. Maybe it's not drugs, but they must be stealing one way or another. I bet your chocolate milk was for one of these guys. Are you going to buy a boat too? A sailing boat would be cooler. What would you do with all that money? I'm not sure, but I know what I'll do when I have 10,000. There's a Moroccan in Tangiers who has Belgian citizenship and four daughters. He smuggles girls across. You'd pretend to be one of them? He does it every three months. He always gets away with it. So when are you leaving? In two years, as long as we don't get caught. Two years? How much is Halil paying you? Three times what I got for carrying packages. God, your brother's tight. But if they let you into Ceuta, why not just take the ferry to Malaga? We can only go for work. We can't even stay overnight. Otherwise they stamp your passport and it's over. Why not come with me? What? Right now! With the jet ski, we'll be in Spain in two hours. Stop making fun of me. I'm not. I mean it. Two hours or two years? Do you think it's that easy? You think they'd let us leave the port just like that? Well... just like that, maybe not. Just a drop, OK? Just a drop, but we've done half a bottle. You're dangerous on Baileys. Cheeky! A drink, Manuel? No, just coffee. I'm driving. That's right, always on duty. Coffee, Nan? I'll go. Surprise! Mari Fe, meet Amina. Happy birthday. Thank you. You really shouldn't have. Come in. What if they'd caught you? And thrown her in the see? They didn't catch me. They didn't, but she's got you by the balls. I know what you're like. The more untameable they are, the better. What's it been? Two days? Yes, two days. Locked up in a hotel, non-stop? She's not at a hotel. She's at a Moroccan girlfriend's. And you're doing them both? It's not like that. We're going to get married. What? Can you hear yourself? Watch out for her kind. The minute she gets citizenship you won't see her for dust. No, she doesn't know yet. It's your idea? It must be sunstroke. It's fucked with your brain. Not so many candles. What? That's at least 30. Fuck it. Yeah, go ahead, laugh. I always felt those mountains were calling me. And now I know why. To find you. Me and a few kilos of hash. Well, that too. Compi and I used to come here, to stare at the see, to have a smoke and to dream. What did you dream about? You'll laugh, but we dreamed about bringing a nice girl here and making love to her, in the see. How many times has it come true? For me? Never. And your friend? Once. He brought Mari Fe once. I didn't speak to him for two weeks. Why? Were you jealous? A little, I guess. It meant he and Mari Fe were serious. So is this serious? What do you think? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Come on! Come on in! Hurry up, it's freezing. It is cold, isn't it? Is that why you kept your dress on? Don't make fun of me. I'm not. There's nobody here. And even if there was... Have I spoiled your dream? You know what I think? Dreams can be shit. I'm freezing my balls off here. This is awesome, dude! How much is it? 120,000 but we'll put two more motors on it! Not two, three! They'll never stop us then! Give it some more gas! I don't like it one bit. You're scared shitless of Rachid. You bet I am. 20 kilos, now and again, is not like doing a big load. You pay people to load it, you pay off the cops. That's a lot of people. That's why you're here. You know everyone here, don't you? Someone has to stay there in Morocco until we return with the money. What if they don't? What do you think? Relax, Compi, you'll be fine. We're going to pay. What? Me? Stay there? No way. I can't leave Mari Fe now. She's not afraid of the dark, is she? She was vomiting a lot. So we got one of those tests from the pharmacy. Turns out she's pregnant. That's great news! Yeah. Any idea who the father is? I'll feed you to the fish, you little Arab prick! - "Little Arab prick... " - I'm not joking, arsehole! What are you doing? Don't! It was a joke! We'll have to get married, for sure. Then there's the crib and all that... Well, you've got money. That's the problem. A bag full of cash, and I can't spend it. The cops won't notice if you buy a crib or a sofa. Fuck the cops. It's Mari Fe I'm worried about. Her and her dad are like the Gestapo. They notice everything! If I go to Ikea to buy chairs, I'm screwed. How do I explain where I got the money? I could say I won the lottery? And the ticket? You're right! I could say I found it. Then hand it in. No, she's not that dumb! Christ, Antonio, you scared me. What's all this money? We're rich, babes! I love you so much! What did she say? She said I was a liar and a crook, and what about our kid... So it went well. Yeah, great. I thought she'd run home to her parents. There they go. How long? 55 minutes. An hour to refuel and change crew. An hour without them on our arse. During the day. We can do it. It worth the risk. I said sorry. I even begged her. I bet you blamed it on me. Of course I did. I blamed you too. I said we'd got in with a bad crowd. Bastard. Did she buy it? I'm not sure, but after two hours of yelling, she shoved all the cash into the bag. Then she said, "Let's go shopping". Son of a gun! I had to swear I wouldn't do it again, though. We can bring the boat in there. It'll take five of us ten minutes. Fucking great. Yes. That's it! Come on! Come on, Compi! The dad-to-be! That's it, Compi! Your last party! Come here, man! This is a historic moment. Let's record it. Son, this is how your daddy's fortune started. Is this like a date for workmates who meet out of work? Yes, exactly. Listen to this. It's the Englishman. Where did you get this? From Interpol. That's Murat Agani, Albanian Kosovar. He works out of Hamburg. He deals in heroin and now cocaine. Interpol want anything we find, and we get this. Good work. Any other wire taps? Isn't this enough? They said they want to kill you! Who's heard this? Did you hear me? - Eva... - Let's drop it. Let's just forget this crap. We're not exactly saving the world. It's not worth it. - Not worth it? - No. I see. Then what are we doing? Playing cops and robbers? Just paying the bills? What the fuck are we doing? If it's not worth it, what the fuck are we doing? Can you tell me? Sorry, I'm really tired. No problem. I'm really tired. If they know about the photo... ...it means we have a mole. Giving them information. Who else has heard it? No one. I wanted to show you before Vicente. Don't give it to him. Why not? Who gave you authorisation to go to Interpol? What are you saying? No way, Vicente is with us on this. Have a look at his accounts, find something... No, no... I can't. He wouldn't be so stupid to leave any evidence. Then, check out his dad or brother. You know how it works. You OK? How can you live like this? Yes? Is Amina there? No, she's not. I've been looking for her all day. Come up, then. Come in. Do you want a drink? No, thanks. What's going on? Amina left this for you. It's the Hand of Fatima. It protects whoever wears it. She never took it off. She's gone. I'm sorry. Did she say where? You should let her go now. I'll be the judge of that. Please, tell me where she is. What's the story? You just needed some fool to help you get across? I was that fool. I saved you ten grand. Do I pretend we never fucked? Stop it, you're hurting me. What about me? I don't get it. I was going to ask you to marry me. I never asked you for anything. Not money, not papers, not even to bring me across. I had everything planned. But now... Now what? All I know is that I don't want to spend Sundays visiting you in prison and having sex once a month. That's if you don't wind up dead at the bottom of the sea. That's not going to happen. Yes, it is. It's what happens to people who do what you do. I'm not stupid. I can handle it. Nothing's ever gone wrong. It has for me. Too many times. And I'm tired. I'm afraid. - What if I stop? - You won't. - Why? - It's too much money. I don't care about money. You say that now that you have plenty. You don't believe me? Then give me a fortnight. Or a month, perhaps. Just to be sure, then you and I can go wherever you want. What if you're not back in a month? Then forget me. Nio! We've got to go now. We need to be on the beach in an hour. Hang on, wait a sec. Are you really leaving me? No way. I'm not staying. But we agreed. Don't back out now. Why has it got to be me? Why not him? I'm worthless to them. Why would you give a shit about some fucking Arab? And I drive the boat, so I'm afraid it's you. It'll be fucking paradise. Order anything you like: food, drugs, whores... Don't worry, I will. But you come with that money. We'll be here Monday. See you Monday, then? Yes. Come on. It's just landed. Let's go. I don't like going out in daylight. Next time, let's make sure it's a new moon. There won't be a next time. What do you mean? This is my last time. The money we'll make from this means we can do other stuff. I don't want to do other stuff. Then hook up with Rachid or someone else, but count me out. What's that? It's my sister, isn't it? I should never have got her involved in this. And just who the fuck are they? - Fucking hell. - What? It's the Royal Moroccan Navy. They're trigger-happy, that lot. Didn't we pay them off? They don't take bribes. Then we have to switch routes. What about our plan? Fuck it, we'll just have to improvise. Do I look like a fool to you? Did you think I wouldn't find out? Search all you like! You won't find anything! But I'll remember this! You bastard! Making friends as usual, Jess? Fucking hell. You never learn, do you, mate? Tell them it's leaving again. The chopper's just left. Where was it again? Ten miles from Punta Mala? Yes. There they are. At 11 o'clock. The helicopter! Go faster! Hello? Sink the boat! Sink it! Do it now. Hey, I think I recognise our speed demon mate down there. That kid who got away? - I think so. - Yes. It's him. Watch him. He's a bit of a daredevil. Well, we'll give him a run for his money. Let's fuck with them. Manolo, get in closer. The helicopter is behind us! Fuck! Now, I'm only going to say this once: Cut your engines. Fuck! Who the fuck does he think he is? Steve McQueen? He doesn't even flinch. They're getting wet now. They could do with a fucking shower. Hold on. We've got a mayday. Ten miles from here. A boat with two crew members. It's sinking. Tell search and rescue. Hit them again. Listen... we're closer. We have to help. What if it's a set-up by this lot to get rid of us? Wouldn't be the first time. I'm turning back. Fuck it. They're leaving! Fuck off, pussies! You fell for it! Fuck you! Jess! Look at the Arab. He's got a fucking nerve. Cheeky bastard. He's not giving me the finger! Go back! We have to help the others. It's the law. Manolo, let's get these guys first. Then we'll go back. Make them dump the cargo at least. If anything happens, I'm not responsible. Whatever you say. They're coming back! Let's toss it overboard! What about Compi? If they catch us with it... Hold on tight! They're right above us! Give them hell, Manolo! I've almost got the runner up his arse! He's back again! Shit! Go for it, man. Show them who's boss. What's with you today? That's it, Manolo. They're not dumping it. I'll be fucked if I let them get away with this! Now who's fucked? Go faster, damn it. Throw it overboard for fuck's sake! Get me closer. Closer! Lower, Manolo. There you go. Shit! Hold it there, Manolo. That's it. A bit closer! I'm on it! That did it! Get onto the engine. What? They won't shoot you! Do it! Watch out for that one. Damn it, Manolo, closer! Watch it! What the fuck is that? Get that flare out of here! Get it out! I can't see! What the fuck... Where's Manolo? Get a move on, Halil! They're dead, and so are we. Get moving, damn it! Let's get the fuck out of here! No, I'm fine. It was just a scare. The pilot? We don't know yet. There's no need to fly down, love. Me too. Big kiss. Bye. How sweet. Was it Mara? Yes. She wanted to get a plane and come down here. - Your daughter? - Yeah. How old is she? She's beautiful. Does she study abroad? Eh? Is she studying abroad? Yes. She's doing a master's. When I was down there, all I thought about was her. All I could think was, "Mara, Mara... " Any news? No. Not yet. He'll pull through. Manolo's as strong as an ox. Vicente, I accept full responsibility, no matter what. Take it easy, there'll be plenty of time for that. Halil, is everything OK? Yes, don't worry about the news. There was an accident but Grandma and Grandpa are here and they're fine. When can you collect them? Tonight. Halil? Halil! Halil! What the fuck did they do to you? It was Rachid. He took everything. He let us come this far and now he's taken it all. What do we do now, Halil? How the fuck are we going to pay? They've got Compi. Hey! What is it? Wait! No, no! Please! They're bringing the money. Please! Get off me! Please, please, please... They're bringing the money today! Three days. If we haven't paid by then... Three days. Shit. Thanks. If I don't pay them, they'll kill my friend. You should've thought of that before you left him there. Ask them to give me time to pay. - How? - By working. - Who for? - For you. What? Like the other day? Downing the chopper? Do you think anyone will hire you now? Just pray the pilot doesn't die, because if he does, it might just be me... who gives you up to the police, just so that they'll leave us alone. They're looking for us. Asking for the guys who shot down the chopper. They say they have a job. I don't like it. Sounds like a trap. Why give work to a pair of outcasts? Say we'll talk to them. We need the money. I don't like it. Sorry, Halil. We have to risk it. What's this? A present for you. They spent hours driving around the Rock. "No pain no gain," right? Did you follow him home? Yes. I've got his name and address, but that's all. I can't link him to anything. Have you ever seen him before? What's up, man? How are you doing? I'm still here. They gave me some pills, so it doesn't hurt too much. It's gone a really horrible colour. At least they haven't killed me or cut my fingers off yet. Let's see what happens. But I tell you something, I'm sick of these drums! It's like Holy Week in Seville every day! Hang in there, Compi. Don't smoke too much. Mari Fe will see it in your eyes. Have you spoken to her? I saw her yesterday. What did you tell her? The truth, Compi, the truth. Tough shit. She went all quiet and serious, then grabbed a knife and told me if I don't get you back she'll kill me. See how much she loves me, Nio? You see? Chin up, Compi, it's under control, OK? Nice one, mate. I knew you wouldn't let me down. So, everything's set for Friday, yeah? Yeah. Is it definite? These guys are pissed off. For sure. I'll do this job on Thursday, and they'll get their money on Friday. OK? OK. See you, man. See you. Here's the address. It's easy to unload there. We'll only need half an hour. Those guys aren't English. Must be Russians or Albanians. So what? Remember that guy at the port? They still haven't found his head. What are they doing? Why aren't they leaving? I don't like this one bit. If you don't want to do it, just say so and I'll find someone else. No. You're right. We've got to do it for Compi. The boat has a tracking device. We can track their every move. We know where they'll leave from, but not where they're going. When we see where they're going, the Civil Guard can catch them on land. I'll be right back. Are the Customs lot coming too? - Where were you? - Look here. You know how sometimes you just remember something. you didn't notice at the time... Wait! What are you on about? Him talking about his daughter. What? A Jersey bank account, in the name of Mara Rubio. Sergio's daughter. Her university fees come out of it. Tuition alone costs what Sergio makes in a year. Could be an inheritance or his wife's money. It's nothing like that. We've been recording their calls, monitoring them, and Sergio knows it. If it is him, he'd warn them. They would call it off. I don't know. Something doesn't make sense. If they want a hash smuggler to run coke, there's plenty of choice. Why the guy who brought down the helicopter? The Englishman knew we were onto him. And that we'd end up following this kid. And that you'd recognise him. It's a decoy. We go after the kid, meanwhile his shipment comes in through the port. You can't fool me with your text thing. You went for a smoke. Jess, how much can they get on that boat? 200? Up to 300 kilos. 300. If we put 300 kilos of cocaine on the table. they'll start taking this thing seriously. Good work. Let's go. Good luck tonight. OK. Vicente... Can I have a word? If it's to tell me that you and your girl have finished searching and found nothing, save your breath We've found something. We need more than this. There isn't time. If we call it off, they won't use the port. We're not even sure about the port. It's the only explanation. We have to play it cool so Sergio won't get suspicious. Well, he's your friend. I'm sure he trusts you no matter what. Jess. I'm warning you. If, after tonight, we have nothing against Sergio, you're out. This just arrived from Caracas. It's the only container matching the Interpol data. Great. It's that one. What's the cargo? Suitcases. What's the pilot like? Mario? He's a really nice guy. Used to be in Alicante with Fernando and Antonio. He's one of our own. He can't wait to lay into these guys. So we need to be careful. We need keep cool heads tonight. There they are. Let's have a bet. You're on. Where are they headed? 50 says it's Sotogrande. - I say La Duquesa. - No way. Small, discreet, classy... One more crook won't stand out. They're going to Sotogrande. Someone owes me 50 smackers. We didn't shake on it. - You bastard. - Just talk for talk's sake. He's a sore loser. Then don't bet. They're heading for Sotogrande. We're on our way. Jess, do you copy? We've got the location. The Civil Guard will be there in 15. 15 minutes. These guys will be gone by then. What shall we do? Turn around. Drop it! Drop the gun! You drop it! Or I'll blow his brains out! Halil, no! Shut it! I'm in charge now. You got that? Drop the gun now! Calm down, all right? For fuck's sake! Take it easy! I'll blow your head off! Halil, calm down. No one's fucking with me anymore! Listen to me. Halil! Here's what we'll do. We both put down our guns right now. You leave with one of those bags, before anyone else gets here. One bag is enough to pay for your friend. That's why you're here, isn't it? For Compi. Am I right? We've been following you for days. Shut it! You don't want to get fucked over again, but that's just what they're doing. Why do you think you got this job? You're a decoy to distract us. What's he saying, Nio? He's making it up. There's no decoy. It's real coke. You know it is. You're so green. A few kilos is nothing compared to a tonne through the port. Then why the fuck are you here? Jess, do you copy? We're in position outside. Where are you? What do we do now? If we turn ourselves in, Compi is dead. Dead! What a fucking mess! Halil, if you put the gun down, we can sort this out. Halil, put the gun down! Halil, listen! Listen! Halil! Throw the gun on the floor! Halil, look at me! Listen! I'm putting my gun down, I'm putting it down. Halil, it's on the floor! Halil, he put his gun down! Take it easy! It's on the floor, OK? Halil, listen to me. Calm down. Do as I say and you can still save your friend. But we have to do it now. We have to do it now. It's OK, it's OK. They're leaving in a 4x4. Heading for the avenue. He's injured. Call for an ambulance. Jess, are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. And is Sergio with you? Yes, he's here. Did you find it? There's nothing here. What? We're still checking, but no luck so far. Either way, stay with him. Don't let him contact anyone. OK. All right? Give me your phone. How long have we known each other? 20 years? Something like that. You could at least hear me out. What is this about? Was it Eva? Did she come up with all this shit? They didn't find anything at the port, did they? They won't find anything. There's nothing to find. Stop the vehicle. Get out, arsehole! If there was anything, it's not here. It's in another container. We have to check. We still can... Eva... That's enough. It's over. No, come on, Vicente. This is cocaine with knobs on. Yes? Jess It was the suitcases! The suitcases themselves! 2,000 kilos of pure cocaine. Jess, are you there? Yes, but it's not a good signal. Do you know where I am? At the hangar, looking at the Rock. I wish you were here. Listen, Jess. We should go celebrate. It's been two fucking years. It's over at last. It's over. Yes, it's over. What? Aren't you happy to see me? Of course I am. I was expecting Compi again. He's outside. I can get him. No, I've seen enough of him. In the end, I couldn't come and get you. I waited three months. You waited for me? It's not like I had anything else to do. Where would I go? - This is all so weird. - What? Everything. I'm in here, you're as beautiful as ever. Did you hear about Compi? About him becoming a father? No, he's over that. He's joining the Civil Guard. It's true, I swear. Mari Fe dragged him to her dad's station, and he had no choice but to fill in an application. How are they treating you here? Fine, they're all real charmers. But it'll be a while before I get out. My lawyer says seven years, and that's if I behave myself. Then make sure you do. Hello? It's me. I'm on my way to the school. OK, so I can pick up the kid later, right? - Yeah, at 5 p. m. He'll be waiting for you. - Perfect.
