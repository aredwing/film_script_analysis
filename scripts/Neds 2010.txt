Oh, Headmaster? Could we have a photo with you, please? - Oh, thanks a lot. - Thank you. All right, everyone look at me. And everyone say, "To success." To success! That your book, aye? Is it, aye? Is that cos you're a clever cunt? Or you think you're a fucking clever cunt. - Where are you from? - Carden. Fucking poofs. I hate every one of them. Going to big school after the summer? That's my fucking school... - Good luck, McGill. - Are you fucking listening to me? Do you know who I am? Do you know, no? I'm Canta from Hardridge and I like battering swotty cunts like you! When you're in my school, you'll get your cunt kicked in. Every single day. First day, I'm gonna break your legs. Fucking demolish you. Rip your head off. I swear to God you're dead, wee man. First day, you're fucking dead! Your mum was saying you wanna be a journalist. We have the best journalists in America. They're not afraid to investigate anything to get to the truth. And they love the Scots. They love us cos we tell it like it is. And we don't bow down to anybody. Your dreams are gonna come true, you know. Anything you want. Just work hard. - The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. 'For months now, I've been living on a desert island. 'And my solitude, far from diminishing, grows from day to day...' What have you got this fire on for, John? I can't be doing with this. You know we can't afford that. And why have you got the curtains closed, eh? What are you doing sitting here in the dark? - Excuse me. - What is it, pal? - Do you know Benny McGill'? - Benny McGill'? Come here a minute, pal. Come here. Stand there. - Who are you? - I'm his wee brother. Are you? - No, you're not. - I am. Benny McGill's wee brother is a smart wee cunt. How do you no know I'm not on my way to go stab fuck out of him right now? And how do you know I wouldn't take it out on you? See that there? That's a fucking blade. Know what that's used for? For gutting daft wee boys like you, you wee cunt! Luckily for you, I'm a good guy. Me and Benny are good pals. I'm Fergie, all right? You're all right with me, wee man. Don't fucking start greeting on me. Come here. You want to go find your brother? - Yeah. - He's fucking hanging down about there. We'll go look for him. Never seen a bread knife before. What you like, you wee cunt? Hurry up, wee man. Any of youse two seen Benny? You just missed him. He's in town with Minty. - Sorry, you've missed him. - Can I leave a message for him? Tell there's a boy gonna do me in the day I go back to school. - What's his name? - Canta. Canta? Youse two heard of a cunt called Canta? No, never heard of him. He's trying to wind you up. Don't take any fucking notice of him. Can you tell Benny, please? Wee man, I've been smoking dope since age of 11. How the fuck am I gonna remember that? - Have you not got a pen? - Do I look like a cunt with a fucking pen? - Any of youse two got a pen? - I've got an eyeliner pencil. - Gonna give us it, then? - Fuck off, that cost a fortune. Fuck's sake! Fucking knife is mightier than the pen. All right. With a 'K' or a 'C'? Er...don't know. Fuck it, we'll do it with a 'K'. That's got straight lines in it. Here we go. - 'A', - I know how to spell, fuck's sake! - There we go, Canta. - From Hardridge. Get to fuck! That's got fucking 'S's and 'L's and fuck knows what in it. You'll do my fucking ma's new kitchen knife in. We'll put down Paka, eh? 'P', - Who's Paka? - Paka's not a 'who'. it's a 'they'. That's the fucking team from Hardridge. Is that me done? Can I go back to doing fuck all? Yeah. Thanks a lot. Can you believe that's fucking Benny's wee brother? Wee boy needs a fucking good slap. Fucking blame the parents, so I do. 'I can see you're ready to go, 'so I'll wish you all good luck in your latest venture.' 'Thank you very much' 'World of History is proud to present the premier... ...'of the Townswomerfs Guild re-enactment ...'of the Battle of Pearl Harbour.' Fucking arsehole. Think you can dig my wee brother? You fucking dick! Watch how it's done, wee man. OK, ready? - Are you fucking shiteing it now? - One, two, three... Stand up, stand up! Two, three... Look at the state of you, you fucking shitebag poof. You wee fucking cunt. One, two, three... Fucking get over it now, you wee fucking cunt. You fucking arsehole. Here, mate. You're fucking lucky. Get to fuck, move! Benny, come on. Come on! My name is Mr Gallagher. I am Headmaster of the boys' annex. This is where you will be for the next 2 years. When you go into third year, you will be over there in the main building. I will assign each of you a class, first by reading out the class, then the names of the boys who will be in that class. First is 1A1, top class. In youse come. Quickly. Hurry up! Move! Quicken Hurry up. In! Quietly! Sit down. Find a seat. Get in, hurry up. - You not got a seat? - No, sir. - What's your name? - John McGill. - Sir? - Yes? They read his name out for 1A2. 1A2's next door. Mr McLeod's class. - You two, sit down! - Mr McLeod'? - One of yours. - Stand there. Hurry up, hurry up! Sit down! Come with me, Mr Burrill. There. Hands up. There will be no...pushing... Up! ...shoving... ...or fighting in my class! Understand? Sit down. - Name? - John McGill, sir. - Take a seat. - Sir, I want to see the Headmaster. - What for? - I don't think I should be in this class. Are we not good enough for you? I said, are we not good enough for you, Mr McGill'? I'm not saying that, sir. I just wanna see the headmaster. Fine. Go and see the headmaster. If you've been pissing me about, you'll be the next one to get this. - Understand? - Yes, sir. Well, off you go. Close the door behind you. Come in! - What's your name? - John McGill, sir. - Class? - Well, they put me in 1A2. - Who are "they"'? - I don't know. I was hoping you'd know. - Are you being cheeky, son? - No, sir. - What did you say your name was? - John McGill, sir. - Which primary? - Blessed Mary's Primary, sir. - Are you related to Benjamin McGill'? - He's my big brother, sir. - Are you proud of him? - He's my big brother, sir. What I'm asking is are you gonna turn out like him? No, sir. He assaulted two teachers last year and was expelled indefinitely. - What do you think of that? - Bad, sir. Bad that he assaulted two teachers or that he was expelled? Both ways, sir. - Is he still living at home? - Sometimes, sir. Is he in gainful employment? He's hoping to get work at the shipyard, sir. Looking for painters and decorators, are they? Before the Christmas break, the top two in each class move up and the bottom two move down. If you can manage to come in the top two, and, more importantly, prove to me that you're a different boy from your brother, then you can move up to 1A1. - Sir, I just don't understand... - it's not for you to understand. It's for me to understand. Now, get back to your class. Periods 3, 4, 5 and 6, it's Latin with Mr Bonetti. Well? We're all eager to hear what the headmaster had to say. If I work hard and behave myself, I'm out of here before Christmas. It's not a bloody prison sentence, McGill. Sit down. And copy what you've missed off one of your classmates, if they're not intimidated by your superior intellect! Periods 7 and 8, music. Period 9, physical education. Down here now, cow! I want you down here now! I want you here, cow! I want you down here! Don't make me come up there! You fat slag! Shh! I want you down here, now! Right now! Fat bitch! Come down here, right now! Don't make me come up there! Don't make me come up there! You fat slag! Come down here, right now! Right now! Fat bitch. Now...as you can see, I've written the marks in the top right-hand corner. Now some of you, if not indeed most of you, might assume that these are marks out of 10 and thus think that you have done rather well. But, in fact, these are marks out of 100. And you have embarrassed yourselves. One pupil, however, has embarrassed himself more than all the others. Stand up, Mr McGill. Now before you all sharpen your adolescent claws, let me tell you that the source of this young man's embarrassment... ...lies not in failure but in a shining success. 100 out of 100. Full marks. Now, this shall no doubt, result in you singling Mr McGill out as a swot. So, I have decided to take it upon myself to get it in first. You are a swot, Mr McGill. You have the temerity to exercise your intelligence and thus rise above the mediocrity of your peers. Come on. Up you get. Take your place upon the podium, up here, on the upper level. Please. An example to you all, boys. Mr McGill...l salute you. Round of applause for Mr McGill. - All right. That's enough. - Arsehole. Any of those snowballs hit me, you'll get a toe right up your arse. Youse have been warned. Oi! What one of youse two threw that? What's your name? Right, listen up. I have averaged out your various class marks. Top of the class with 87%... ...Liam McCole. Well done, McCole. Second is 85%... - ...John McGill. - Yes! Sit down, McGill. Try and curb your enthusiasm. - I thought I was going next door, sir. - Sit down! You could show your classmates a little bit more respect. Despite what you may think, they have also worked hard these last few months. Third place, with 80%, Stephen McLaughlin. Fourth with 79%, Dean Walker. Fifth, with 75%, Lloyd Butler. Also with 75%... Mitchell, Brown. McCole, McGill. Take your seats. And stop your crying. Why, whenever a boy is sent to this class, he seems to think he's in the beginning of a never-ending downward spiral to failure? Now I'm starting to take this personally! I am just as good as any other teacher in this or any other bloody school. You don't know you're born. You could have had, like me, an education with the nuns... Wait! Before you all... Wait, shut up. Shut your mouth! Before you all go away, here, book tokens. Third place... ...McKendrick. There we go. Second place, Engels. There you go. And first, McGill. All right, now you can go. On your way. Enjoy your summers. John, wait there, please. Have fun. You did very well this year. Thank you, sir. - Going on holiday with your family? - No, sir. Boys your age can find themselves with nothing to do over the summer. And sometimes they get themselves into trouble. So try and keep yourself occupied. There's a friend of mine runs a summer school for kids like yourself. Keeps them fit. I think you'd get a lot out of it. - Understand? - Yes, sir. Go. Enjoy yourself. Oh, no, I'm not having this again. No way. Bad enough your father turning this place into a doss house without you... What are you staring at? When you near your illness read out, put your hand up. Okay? All right. Er...perforated eardrum? Okay. Er....diabetic'? Good. Okay. Epilepsy? All right, buddy. And who's the other asthmatic? Okay. Glass eye? Oh, that's good. It looks...a good one. Er...hole in the heart? Okay. - And you've had the operation? - Aye. Your mammy's happy you're here? Aye? Good, good, good, okay. - Right, what have you got? - I've got verrucas, sir. "Verrucassir"? Oh, verrucas, right. What's a "verrucassir"? Yourself? Have you? - You're a bit young, are you? - Just sort of happened, you know. How do you spell that, do you know? What about youse boys? You must have something wrong with you. No? Well, you two better keep eating your porridge, cos it looks as if the future of the human race is gonna depend on you. Right, okay. Fielders, go to the field. Batters, get behind me...Satan. This is fucking amazing, man. You're rich. It's my dad's player but he lets me borrow his records. Try them. Sounds fucking amazing. - Will I take them out? - Aye. Put them on. Here. You ready? - This is fucking amazing, man. - What? Fucking amazing, man! Bring your friend down for some juice and biscuits, please, Julian. - We have to go down. - Down where? For some juice and biscuits. There we go. - So what's your name? - John. - And which school do you go to, John? - St John of the Cross. Oh, so is that Lourdes Chapel you attend? - Yeah. - Oh? Biscuit? Thanks. - And what does your father do? - He's a toolmaker. - Do you have brothers and sisters? - Two. What about your mother? Does she work? She's part-time. In a supermarket or something? No. She's a nurse in the Southern General. Oh... And what do you want to do when you leave school? - Go to work with your father? - No. I want to go to university. Really? And study what? I dunno. Is this one of them? No. No, he's not one of them. You better not be pissing me about, son. - What you running for? - Don't know. - Where do you stay? - Dove Street. - What's your name? Name? - John McGill. Are you sure he wasn't one of them? I'm not repeating myself to you, you prick. If you're fucking with me, son, I'll come back and do you worse than those boys ever could. - You got me? - Got you. On your way, son. Fucking state of them, man. How do you not just get a new pair? - Can't afford them. - How? Your mum and da are minted. Say they spend too much on my school fees. - I can give you my pair if you want. - How come? My ma says if I get a paper round, then I can get a Provy cheque. - What's a Provy cheque? - You never heard of a Provy cheque? Fuck's sake! You can get them up to 100, then pay it back a pound a week. - I'm getting one for 25 fucking quid. - Really? That'd be good. Cool. Is that a tennis racket? I don't even know why I've got it. Never play tennis. Picture Bruce Lee with this thing. One minute a poofy bastard, next minute you're fucking rattling cunts. Fuck! Fuck, man. - Fuck's sake. - Sorry, I didn't know you put it there. I'll get my dad to sort it. it's fine. It was an accident. Move. - Is Julian home? - No, he's not here just now. Er...do you know when he'll be back? He's at his aunt's so he'll be late. - Can I leave these here for him? - What is it? - Football boots. - No, he'll not be interested in those. - Will he be in tomorrow? - I don't know. I don't think you should come round here again. All right? Good. Off you go. - Quality, man. - Aye. Where you going? - Up the road. - Where's up the road? Just up there. - What's in the bag? - Football boots. - What size are you? - 8. Fucking let them go. You're an 8, aren't you, Keyman? There you go, I swatched them. Any money on you?

Just looking after that for you, mate. Know what I mean? - I've seen him. - You're on your own with this one, man. If you're gonna hit him, do it now. Go. Go on! - Do you want a drink? - You fucking dick! What? So, John, are you teaming up with us? - Who are youse? - What do you mean, who are we? Car-D, my man!

Stay out this school! You're nothing to do with this school any more! - Sir! - What is it? - Whats so fucking important? - Think I've been stabbed. Right... Marcus... ...est.. ..inn... ...horto... Anybody tell me where you would find Marcus? As usual I'll turn to the knowledgeable Mr McGill to provide the answer. Mr McGill'? Mr McGill, are you with us? What? I said if a Roman said to you, "Marcus est in horto," where would you find Marcus? Who? Now, you see, such is Mr McGill's modesty, that he feigns ignorance in order to avoid embarrassing you all. If a Roman said to you, "Marcus est in horto," where would you find Marcus? Dunno. - I think you do. - Just said I dunno. Right. Well, you're obviously all still in holiday mode, so I want you to turn to page 7A in your textbooks, and reacquaint yourselves with basic first year Latin. - Is anything the matter, John? - Get your fucking hand off us, man. What did you say to me? - Have you done this? - No. - I think you did. - I didn't. - You did this, didn't you? - No. Right, come on. Stand up. Up you get. And come with me. Come on. Down here. You stand here. Stand here. Now... ...in the 3 years I have been at this school, this has never been used. Now...l am prepared to overlook both your belligerency and your vandalism, if I am given first an admission and, secondly, an apology. Don't even know what you said. I find it difficult to believe that in the space of 6 weeks, you have suddenly degenerated into idiocy. - So now I'm stupid? - I don't have to take this. So what you gonna do about it? I'll tell you what, tell me to put my hands up, then lash me with that belt like a real teacher. Right, you get your hands up. Come on. Put them up, properly. In front of you. Separately. There! Now, you get back to your seat. Go on! - Is that it? - What? What, is that all you're gonna do? If you're gonna do it, do it properly. I don't know... what's got into you, McGill. But if I have to knock some sense into you, then I bloody well will! There, six. Now sit down! "Marcus is in the garden." But Shh. Just what do you hope to achieve by all this, McGill'? Right! Youse want a NED? I'll give youse a fucking NED. What's happened to you, fuck's sake? Someone's cashed in their fucking Provy cheque. You paying us in, then? Krew ya bass! Come on! Fucking...

They're all gonna stab me. - I don't even know you from Adam! - Please. Well, you'd better come on in. You never get the police when you want them. This used to be a good area. Now you can't step over your front door without worrying what these thugs are at. What sort of parents let their weans roam the streets like a pack of wolves. Should all be locked up. Where have you been? I've been worried sick. This young lad was nearly killed. Where have you been? - I was at my pals, you know where. - I told you to be back by 9 o'clock. I don't want you out when there's lunatics running about. - I'll walk him up the road, Ma. - You will not. Stay right where you are. I don't want you out there with those eejits running about. Er...l think it's all right to go now. - Are you sure, son? - Aye, I should be safe. - Cheers for the tea and biscuits. - Look after yourself. Be careful out there. Aye. All right, cheerio, son. - Fuck did youse lot get to? - Did you not get Benny? - What? - He went over there looking for you. Fuck's he doing talking to that cunt? Put the tool down. Put the fucking tool down. Fuck, man. You wee prick! Fucking Young Car-D! Come on, you cunts! Come on! Fucking dafties! Should've stabbed that fucking Benny when we had the chance.

Johnny, Claire wants you to fill in her hole. - You'll need a bigger pen than that. - Shut it or I'll kick you in the hole. - Where are you from, sweetheart? - Govan, why? Fuck, man. Govan hairys in the house, boys. - Fucking hairy you, you arsehole. - Who the fuck you calling a hairy? Boy there says he's just moved in. Wants to hang about with us. - He's got a bit of blow and that. - Fuck, man, tell him to bounce down. Says he doesn't like to in case John batters him. - Where is he? - Over there. - Too right I'll fucking batter him. - That's nasty. - What's he done to you? - He dug me up. - Did you sort it? - Benny did. Ah, Benny did! Bring him up here, I'll kick his fucking head in. - He's all right. - Is he fuck, mate. You'll fucking what? - I'll kick his head in, mate. - Kick whose fucking head in? I decide.

Just tell the cunt to come over. it's all right. Just get him over. What made you move from Hardridge, Canta? My ma wanted me to keep out of trouble and not fall in with the bad crowd. - Bad crowd? - Oh, aye. And this wee cunt's got the giggles over here. Two snowmen in afield. One turns to the other one and says, "Why do you smell of carrots?" - The other one says, "l see coal." - Fucking knob-end. John. Claire wants to know if you want to go a walk? - If she wants. - I'll go get her. You better not rip my tights. - I'll be back in a minute. - You better not leave me here. - I'll be back. - I mean it. - Here, mate. Here. - All right. - Here. - What is it? You remember what you done to me? Honestly, John, I'm fucking sorry, I swear to God.

Doesn't matter how long ago. You still did it. I'm sorry. Just shake on it, man. I'm really sorry. - I'm not shaking, but I'll let it go. - Cool, mate. Just remember I won't forget about it. Understand? - You fucking idiot. - What did youse fucking say there? - Never said anything. Honestly. - Never said anything, did you? Didn't say anything, you fuck? And where have you been? Just round at a pal's house. John, shut the door. See, from now on, I want you up in that room every night. Right? Your brother's been arrested. What for? Does it really matter what for? And in the morning... He's up in front of the Sheriff. I want you to go down there. Come back, tell me what happens. I don't want the police phoning next door. And if any of the neighbours ask, we had a break-in. Okay? And your Auntie Beth's coming tomorrow. Here to find out about my brother. - Does he have a name? - Benjamin. Benjamin McGill. What time did he appear? Don't know. The guy at the door wouldn't let me in. - What guy? - That police guy. You mean the police officer? He appeared in front of the Sheriff at 10:00. Bail's been set at 15. If it's not paid by 4:00 this afternoon, be taken out the back, placed in a van and taken directly to Barlinnie Prison. - Now do you have 15'? - No. Well, you better get it before 4:00, eh? I'm here to pay my fine. Ma. Benny needs 15 bail money. - Would you like a cup of tea? - No, you're okay, thanks. This is my son John. He goes to school with your wee lad. Would it be okay if he popped in to see him? - Aye. - Okay. Won't be a minute. You see that wee boy? Someone out his throat in a gang fight. - Now tell me, did your brother do this? - Of course not, Ma. I'm in a hurry. Gotta give us 15. Gonna put Benny in jail. - Maybe that's what he needs. - What? He's not done anything. - Why did they arrest him, then? - Dunno. You know what they're are like.
