As years went by, his physical growth continued unhindered... but his mental age remained that of a child. The way he spoke, his habits, everything... But he had to pay a price for his Innocence. Everyone makes fun of me. If you don't help me, then who will? You are so powerful. Please God, please can you give me a little bit of your power? And, one night, a space-ship landed In Kasauli. Rohit found Jaadu... and his life turned Into bliss. Jaadu blessed Rohit with amazing powers... ...and that transformed him completely. Rohit's fame spread far and wide. One clay he received a special invitation... ...to visit Singapore for some research. The invitation was sent by the famous Dr. Siddhant Arya. Mr. Rohit Mehra, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Unfortunately Sonia Mehra lost both her... son Rohit and daughter-In-law Nisha forever... and her grandson Krishna became her reason to live-. But, she was so scared by Krishna's baffling super powers that she took him away to a remote and unknown location. But Destiny chose the path of love... Krishna followed his love, Priya, to Singapore... where he learnt the shocking truth that... his father Dr. Rohit Mehra was alive. And was being held captive by Dr- Siddhant Arya since many years. Time saw Krishna create a new history. With a broken piece of a mask-.. ...that he donned in the midst of a circus fire. And, this led to the birth of..-... a protector, a friend, a superhero Knish! Kaal's experiment ls a success. Now, this virus--. Will mark the beginning... of the end of humanity. Thank you, Jaadu. I have now understood your secret of harnessing the power of sunlight. If this experiment is successful.--... It will usher In a new beginning... for this world, for all mankind. Just 10 more minutes. Papa? What happened? Is everything alright? Of course. I am also fine! And everything is also fine! In fact, lam so excited that... Papa? Oh , sorry for waking you up. But, It's just 9 minutes to sunrise. Come on, you have to come up to the lab. Come on! - Yes, papa. ('Imam! It should all work today! I have tweaked the formation to perfection. My calculations should not go wrong today. Wow, papa! What's all this? My years of hardwork... and endeavor. Because life originates in light. Light gives life-. And, I think I have finally... managed to create the perfect combination... to multiply the energy of light... by using mirrors to reflect it. This magical combination is naturally present in nature. But, unfortunately we cannot see It. Hence, I have Invented this pen... which is actually an electronic device. Whenever It's In the presence of such a combination... It gets activated and starts beeping... And then, It consolidates and multiples... all the light beams and concentrates it on a subject. And, manifests the life giving properties of light. You mean, the rays of the sun will... revive this dead plant? What? But that's Impossible! What do you mean? Of course it's possible! It will, lam certain. Fingers crossed, cross them! Papa, the sun... The pen has been activated. This means... the placement of all the mirrors is correct. The formation ls absolutely right. The power of the energy ls far too much. I have ta think of something. I must do something. Perhaps, we need to build a filter... that passes just the right amount of radiance... and absorbs the rest of the energy. You mean... a filter with a brain, papa? Correct- A filter with a brain! Easy, I will build It. And then you'll see. This experiment will change face of solar energy-. What are you staring at? Don't you have work today? Corrie on, time to get to office! A filter with a brain. Easy, I'll do It. Krishna! Ready, Papa- Hmm... smart you're looking. Thank you. Did you fix the tyre that someone punctured yesterday? Yeah, no... the thing is-.. Where the hell ls Priya? Priya! I am coming! Ready, Papa- Su re. Get dressed, first. I am ready. Are you sure? I was only touching up... I will finish it up In the car. Puncture! Look. Yeah. Wow I Now you look perfectly ready! I am also ready. Okay, since we are all ready, let's go paint the town red-. Red? Don't you have to go work at the TV channel today? I have to. But, after a quick visit to the parlour. Alright Krishna. Your office ls here. Oh, actually my new office ls a little ahead. If you take the next right... then again the right after the first left--. You will reach the security agency, that's my new office. Even the Air India job? Hurry up! I am getting late! Don't change the topic. What happened this time? I know what happened. What? When the clients must be coming to book their air tickets... he must have been in the air! Hence, the airline authorities mu st have... permanently grounded him. And told him to take off for good. Correct? Right. Papa- That is exactly what happened. Very good. I'm proud of you. That's it. Right there- Step. This is my new office. You work at SIS? Oh husband, come here. Yes, wife? I am going to leave the studio at 4:30 pm. You have to meet me at 5:00 pm sharp. I hope you haven't forgotten. Yes . If you are late again, Mr. Mehra... maybe you'll get fired from being a husband too... l know. Bye. Bye. Alright, papa- Where should l drop you off? What do you mean? I haven't been sacked, yet. Drop me off at the lab as always. We shall overcome... We shall overcome... Krishna... Kripal--. you both have been fired. Here's your termination letter... and here's you rs. What's wrong? Shrunk from a football to a tennis ball? Yesterday, when those four r robbers broke into the jewellery store..- you disappeared! Are you really surprised they fl red you? But, you also? Well, even Iran. But I ran away, so I could come back. What do you mean? I mean... what are you all staring at? We have been sacked... but you still have jobs to do. Get going. - Okay. You don't understand. Yesterday, after I ran off. I mean, left... who entered the store? Who? Who entered? Knish! Correct! Understood the secret? What's my full name'? Kripal Sharma. Yes, take the Kri of Kripal. Kri. And the Sh of Shanna. Sh. Put them together, what do you get? Knish . You? Not so loud. If anyone hears, a crowd will gather. People will ask for autographs, you know what I mean... You still think I am wrong-. Right? Height! Knish is quite ta. And you are... One has to adjust things, my friend. Tall, when a fight is an. But I like to be small on duty. Never mind, you won't get it-. That's the style of us supermen. And, you are a mere common man. Go ahead and find a jab that you might be good at. Correct? Breaking news from Mumbai. The front landing gear of flight AKA 101... coming In from Delhi to Mumbai ls jammed. All the attempts of the pilot to extend It have been futile. Failure to lock down the landing gear can cause a crash landing. This can prove fatal to all the passengers... ...and the crew present In the aircraft. See? Duty calls. I must go. 'And, we'll keep updating you about it, time to time.' - Where did he go? Mumbai Control. AKA 101... waiting for Instructions. AKA 101 we have cleared runway 2-7 for emergency landing... you are cleared to land. Best of Luck. Sir, landing without an extended nose landing gear... can cause the plane to skid... It can even explode. We don't have any other option. We have run out of fuel. We have to take this chance. Pay Attention, please keep your seat belts fastened... and take brace position for landing. What did he say? What's happening? Looks like something ls really wrong. What's going on? Mom, we are going ta be- fine? God, Please help us. Please... Bravo, Knish . Su per job, Krrish. We have safely landed. Knish! Look mum, Knish! - What'? Where'!? An epidemic of an unknown virus has broken out in Namibia-. Disturbing images of the virus outbreak have..-... "Just come In from the city of Gobabis. Our correspondent ls currently at the local office... ...of the International Health Council... waiting for a statement from Dr. Varun Shetty... ...Regional Director of the WHO. On my return from Namibia this morning... I have Immediately briefed senior members of the IHC... about the current state of this outbreak. This virus needs to be contained as soon as possible. Otherwise the consequences would be, would be catastrophic. Infected samples of blood have been dispatched to distinguished... Scientists and doctors In all parts of the world. We need, we need all the help possible... ...In coming out with an antidote. It is now quite clear that the Namibia crisis is escalating. Our channel has set up a toll free emergency... ...help line for any virus related information-. Hello, Yes, Dr. Shetty? Dr. Mehra, lam sure you must have... heard about the life threatening virus... that is creating panic in Namibia-. Yes, we just saw It on TV... Dr. Shetty, how long does It take- fer the symptoms of this virus to show? What ls the Incubation period? People start exhibiting the symptoms within... ...5 seconds to 5 minutes of contact. This virus is spreading rapidly through air and water-. We have sent the blood samples of the... ...infected people to several labs worldwide. You will receive It too. And, I am really hopeful that... you will be successful In coming up with a solution. That's why, you are my last hope, Dr. Mehra. Please, do something. I will give it my all, Dr Shetty- I'll try my best-. Hello. Hello, Dr. Shetty? Yes, who's this? Hello sir, this is Alok Sen- Dr. Alok Sen. Sir, I have to meet you right: now. It's very urgent sir. Please, sir-. Regarding what? Sir... I have some shocking Information about... the virus outbreak in Namibia and its antidote. What! I wlll tell you everything when we meet, sir-. That's why I am calling from a pay phone, sir- Please, sir. Okay... calm down, Dr. Sen. I am heading to my office. Why don't you come there? The address ls... Yes, sir- I know where it: is, I'll be there soon. Good evening, sir. Good evening. I am expecting someone. Okay, sir. - Thanks-. Who are you? Unique, Unusual, Unparalleled. Because, I have no history... no past. Just the present. Su surprised? Whoever you are, you have clearly come to the wrong place. The place is also right, and so is the time. The same can't be said about my Intentions though... What nonsense! Please leave! At least get to kn ow me- first. I am the answer to all your questions. - Look... - You look... into my eyes -. . To find yourself. What the hell do you think you are doing? Sir, there ls a Dr. Sen here to see you... Send him in. Right, sir. Dr. Shetty? I'm Dr. Sen. Thank you for meeting me. You said you wanted to tell me something about the virus? Yes, sir- Here... This contains a sample of the virus, and it's antidote. I work for Kaal Pharmaceuticals. This company experiments with the fusion of DNA--. Of different species to create antidotes for viruses. But sir.-. I recently discovered that... before they can formulate the antidote, they create the virus. They have laboratories all over the world. Sir, I've collected all evidence against them... ...and saved it in this pen drive. You were assigned charge of Lab no. 3. Where you had to put together the DNA of various species... but instead you put together these files? How do you know? I know! You've made a grave mistake by cheating him. He can't stand traitors. This is Kaya-. A miracle of science. Created by the one, who ls creating... his own, new and extraordinary world on Earth. This is Kaal. He believes that he is the master of his awn life and destiny. An enigma. A scientific genius. His research of many years is now capable of changing the world-. But he began every experiment with the aim of changing himself. It ls rather ironic that... a brain so sharp ls housed In a body that ls paralyzed below the neck... except for two of his fingers. Unbelievable as It ls, but It ls true... that Kaal can conjure up the power of his mind Into these two fingers... to lift things, make them fly, or destroy them, through telekinesis. Yet, he has been attempting to obtain the bone marrow... which would rejuvenate him. But when Kaal, with his unusual DNA... could not find his cure among humans... he began experimenting on animals. Fusing together his DNA and blood with that of the animals'... Kaal created creatures as one creates test tube babies. In this process, Kaal made such amazing creatures... whose mind and soul were Kaal's. Human In appearance but beastly In nature and strength. Kaal has named them... Manimals! But despite all efforts Kaal hasn't found the bone marrow yet. His search still continues. Initiate! Start Deliquidation! Fusion ls the future! Begin the final test-. Kaal... - Let It learn to survive In this environment... and, continue your research. I am sure you will find that bone marrow. And success will be yours soon. I am successful even today. You may have noticed the lethal strike of my new manimal, Striker. Success was Kaal's... even when he made you. Fusing my blood with that of a chameleon's. That's the reason you can change your form and shape. Wherever, whenever. Let's find out how many lives the virus has claimed in Namibia-. These red dots Indicate that more than... 40%of Namibia's population has been Infected by the virus. This has thrown many genius scientists off their keel. Our scientists want to know when we should send our antidote. Let sortie more people die. Let there be more fear. It's simple science, Kaya. Our profit will rise as people's hopes fall. This virus ls not natural... It was created. But, sir...who would do such a thing? A madman. Dr. Mehra, an antidote has been successfully... ...made for the virus outbreak In Namibia. This breakthrough was achieved by a company called Kaal Pharmaceuticals. The antidote has reached Namibia and the situation ls under control. Thank God! This antidote has proved yet again that... there are more kind hearted people than evil ones. Knish . Knish . Al Sabah 13th floor, Millat Nagar. Help! Help me! Mummy! Somebody, he)! Vicky! Help! Help me! Help me. There's no need to be scared anymore, you are safe now. Okay'? In fact, we're both safe. But tell me something... what were you doing up there? I was doing my homework, when l saw a pigeon stuck In the wires..-... struggling to break free. So l went up to the roof to set It free. Though I have small hands... I managed to set the pigeon free. But I got trapped. Mother, help me. Mother. But you saved me, Krrish. Thank you, Krrish. Thank you... Krrish. Me? You saved the pigeon's life. Anyone who takes away tears and spreads happiness is Krrish! VVow, even l am Krrish! Yes . But, Krrish, yea have a mask, a suit... and super powers. What do I have? You have an Innocence which has taught me a lesson today-. That, age doesn't matter, courage does. Here's a small gift, from Krrish, to little Krrish. This ls now the symbol of your honesty and righteousness. Welcome to the team. Team? I am a part of you r team, Krrish? Yes, but you must promise me that... you won't try to imitate me by... ...climbing, jumping and leaping off buildings. Promise? - I promise, Krrish. Gone. Sir... yes, sir? Welcome! How nice of you to make It an time! Might as well have come after we closed. By the way, may I ask you what took you so long? I had to go, sir. You had to go? Yes, sir. It was more Important than your job? No. The guests were waiting for Chinese food... and they left with a mouthful of Indian abuses- - Breaking news! Do you get It? Eternal savior, Krrish, rescued another kid and... safely reunited him with his family. Proving yet again, where there's crisis, there is Krrish. On one hand there's Krrish. He flies like the wind, winning over hopeless situations. Yes. - And, on the other, there's you. You run like the wind from situations which need ye... You could learn something from Krrish. Perhaps, If you'd been more like him... I wouldn't have to sack you. You are fired! Sir, please. And, before we wind up, another breaking news. Our reliable sources have confirmed that... Krrish will be off duty, starting 11 :30 tonight. That's It for now. This ls Priya Mehra, Aaj Tak. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Krishna. Happy birthday to you.

And Mr. Balgopal will tell you what It ls, himself. Some other good news? And, who ls Mr. Balgopal? I don't think I even have any friends by this name. Actually, I may just. One can't even recall all the names of his friends at this age. Balgopal? That's your name tool You are going to be a grandpa. Grandpa? Really? Yes, Papa- Every father wants to see his kids grow up. Wants to play with them, fool around with them... But that joy was taken away from me. I could not see the number of times you fell dawn... the number of times you got back up on year feet-.. All the times you came home covered in mu ck. I stlll regret net being able to witness all of that-. But, now, I have no regrets. No complaints. So what If I couldn't be there as a father. I will be there now, as a grandpa. I will live up your childhood... through your child. Thank you, Priya, for completing our small family. And yes. Happy birthday, Krishna. Here's a small gift for you-.. for both of ye... Okay, Pa Pa- And I will distribute these sweets among my colleagues. Everyone will be thrilled. It will be a fun day. What are you doing, Kaal? If only l had the use of all of my fingers... my whole hand... my entire body-. You have no idea what I would be capable of. I am still amazed... how you manage to do, what you do. How did you get these powers? What ls the secret behind It? In spite of being so powerful, why Is... ...your body still wheelchair bound, Kaal? Kaal, you are choking me. It hurts. And It should. Because, you have hurt me. By asking me the question... for which Idon't have an answer. And lam still searching for It. What are you doing, son? Don't misuse your powers. Don't use your powers for destruction. How many times have I told you, Kaal? And haw many times have I asked you, dad? How did I get these powers? Why am I like this? I don't know that. You have been lying all this while. You are lying new too. Trust me, I am telling you the truth. Stop It, Kaal. Kaal... I didn't find an answer then. Even after all this research, all these experiments... I still haven't found the answer-. But, I know science has the answer. And, therein lies my cure-. My cu re lies in that answer-. I have spent millions. I will spend billions. Doctors, how much have we earned from the antidote sales In Namibia? 320 million dollars and counting. A little fear and 320 million dollars. And still counting! The business of fear... ls the best business. But now millions are net enough, we need to earn in billions. It ls now time, to plant the virus In a country... that has a population of billions. India? Or, China'? China's population surpasses that of India, Kaal. But a million Gods rule over India. And people have immense faith in them. Let's find out If any one of their Gods... can save them from our virus. Krishna, let's have Ice cream? Ice cream? But I heard, during pregnancy... women like to have sour things. But I am craving for sweet things. - Really? Because I want our baby to turn out sweet, like you. Aka)'- Let's go and sit there. Stop licking the Ice cream like that! You ate up my ice cream'? I thought you got it for me! I couldn't eat my own! How could I eat yours? Let's get another one. - Let's go. Kri pal, what's u p'? I am quite worked up. I am trying to control my anger. Because I was just accused of being an Ice cream thief. We'd like to have same flavor again. - Okay, sir. So, what will you have? So, you are handing over empty cones to us! Sir, I had filled it. If It was full, why ls It empty now? Sir, you can see while I fill the scoop again. Yes, do It In front of me. Two choco blocks, please. Sir, you saw It for yourself! I had filled It! Yeah, he filled It and yet It's empty. Mummy, my Ice cream? I just got you one. Where's my Ice cream gone? Where ls my Ice cream? Mummy, my Ice cream? Can you fill It once more please? - Yes. sir. What ls It? I'll be right back. But... Yes, KaYa- Kaal, Mumbai's pulse ls about to change. Nerve wracking reports coming In from several parts of Mumbai. This virus ls spreading across Mumbai city. The whole of Mumbai has been engulfed by a horrifying, unknown disease. First report came in from 'CST Railway Station' In no time, a perilous virus has taken over Mumbai. On roads, offices and from every where same reports are coming Similar kind If reports are started coming from" "other parts of city as well. As you can see... fear and horror have spread everywhere. Every hospital ls facing a similar or worse situation. Countless people are critical. And, 117 people have lest their lives to the rapidly spreading virus. Someone call a crane to move this truck. Dad, get up! Wake up, dad, please! Krrish, please help. My wife's in a bad condition. Krrish..- my dad... Krrish, save my child Krrish, my children... Krrish, please save my wlfe... Save my father. Krrish, please help! - Krrish, please help! My fear has come true. It's the same virus that... claimed thousands of lives In Namibia-. Oh my God! But there ls an antidote for this virus. Contact Kaal Pharmaceuticals Immediately. Kaal, after what happened with Striker... we should be wary of Krrish. Our virus will test him too. The Indian government has weakened due to this virus, Kaal. They are contacting our dealers repeatedly. Kaal, the key component of the antidote ls ready. We must start working on the antidote as soon as possible. How long will It take for our scientists to make It? 10 days! The city will be dead In 10 days! People are dying In front of me, In my arms. I can hear their screams... and, lam helpless. I am helpless, papa. What is the point of me being Krrish? There ls a palm. There ls. In spite of being around infected people, you are net affected-. And neither ls Priya, as she ls carrying your baby. All my colleagues have fallen prey to this virus. All except me. That means, we are Immune to this virus. Perhaps, our blood has something that ls... shielding us, protecting us. What are you doing? If I remain Immune to this virus... ...even after It ls Infused In my blood then... my blood can be used to make an antidote for this virus. No, Papa-. I won't let you do this-. Krishna, this ls the only way to find a cure for the virus. Then, Inject It In my blood. No, that's toe risky. I could put you under risk--. But, not the people's hope. Right now, you are everyone's last hope, papa... not me! Test It on me. But. Please, papa. Krishna. Krishna! I am okay. I am okay. This means, I can make an antidote from your blood. Now, we will be able to save people. It should take only a few hours... But... How can we provide the anticode to so many In so little time? How will we do that? Kaal, there's a problem. I don't know how... but, the effect of our virus ls wearing off In Mumbai. One of you has betrayed me. You have cheated Kaal. I warned you that the antidote should not reach India until after 10 days. How, then? Who did It? No one, Kaal. We are still making our antidote! Rumor has It, that a scientist from a research institute In Mumbai... has managed to create the antidote to our virus. What? What nonsense? How can a measly scientist manage to... find an antidote for Kaal's virus? The antidote can only be prepared from... my DNA..-... my blood. And how can anyone get It? From where? How? How can my blood be coursing through someone else's veins? How? Mumbai has once again proved... to be unstoppable, unafraid, invincible by vanquishing this virus. I salute the courage of this city-. The spirit of Its citizens... and more importantly the real hero of this victory. A friend ta the kids-.. A hope for the grown-ups... and, the support to the elders... our very own, Krrish. If you are present here... or wherever you are... please know that words aren't enough to thank you. Yet, we have attempted In our small way to felicitate you and, this shall be the new Identity of the city. And, to present to you all, this new Identity... I would like to call upon stage..-... the man, without whom... even Krrish's efforts would have been futile... Dr. Rohit Mehra. Please come, sir. Thank you for all your love. Thank you so much. But, lam sure If you were In my place... you would have done the same. I was merely a medium. Our effort has been successful... "because of your prayers and well wishes. I would also like to thank Krrish... For making our nights safer and gifting us a promise of a new day. Sir, do you know Krrish? I believe in Krrish. I believe that... we all have the essence of Krrish In us. Every person, who uses their abilities to help others... who extends a helping hand selflessly... who stands by those In need... ls, Indeed Krrish. We all have Krrish In us. Even lam Krrish. Krrish told when leaved a pigeon. He also gave me this symbol. Even I have one. Me too. I have one mo! "The Almighty" "Created man" "The Almighty" "Created man" "Who has come on this earth" To execute His plan" "He ls a friend's friend" "A best friend" "The evil ones fear his very name" "The Almighty" "Created man" Till yesterday he steed alone" "I have decided to walk on His path Till yesterday he steed alone" "I have decided to walk on His path "Together we make this world a beautiful place" "We will bring the dawn of love" "Together we make this world a beautiful place" "We will bring the dawn of love" "He ls a friend's friend" "A best friend" "The evil ones fear his very name" "The Almighty" "Created man" "The Almighty" "Created man" Looks like Krishna's here. I'll check, papa. What's the matter, Priya? Who ls It? No one, papa. Priya! Priya! Priya. What's her blood group? O positive. Any medical history, any allergies? No. But, Priya ls pregnant. Krishna, howls Priya? I don't know anything yet, papa. They have taken her In for a check-up. What's going on, Palm? Don't worry. We'll soon find out. Thanks to you one of the attackers ls In our custody. I just hope... Mr. Mehra... your wife ls alright now. But, lam sorry to say, we couldn't save the baby. Papa. It's going to be alright... It's going to be fine-. We don't need tears right now. Because Priya needs you, Krishna. You must make her smile again. You must teach her how to live again-. And, only you can do It. Only you, Krishna. Welcome, Mrs. Priya Mehra. I hope you had a pleasant journey. Who are you? I know strange places can be frightening. You are In Kaal's world. Here, lam trying to have a conversation with you... and you are trying to run from trying to attack me. It's not safe to be running In your condition, for both of you. So, please, sit clown-. Sit! Who ls Krrish? Who Is he? I... I don't know. But you do know... that the antidote for my virus... was created by your father-In-law, Rohit Mehra. I'm sure you know how. I don't know that. But, I do knew that... only you have the answers to all my questions. Look, please... my family... my husband... They must be searching for And If they... We search for things that are missing. But you are not missing, Priya. You are here. And there tool Yes, two seats please. Priya, all set! First day, first shew-. Shall we go? Where are you lost? I am right here. In from of you. You are In front of but not with me. What? If you were really here... you'd have sensed that I have changed. Yes, ma'am, starting today, I'm all you rs. Just like your channel entertains 24/7... lam here at your service, to entertain you. I have the list ready for each day. From Sunday to Monday. From shopping to cinema. And, I won't ask for any leaves. Nor any promotions. I only want my salary. Which would be--. A few thousand smiles. A few million hugs-. A few billion kisses. That's all I want. So, where do we start? You've read my mind. Where do we start? We start by letting go of the past. This ls really strange. His heart is beating only once every two minutes-. This means, he ls hibernating. In this suspended state, along with this heart rate... he can stay alive for as long as he wants. But, human beings can't do that. But some animals can. They hibernate underground... and resurface only when the weather ls favorable. Perhaps, he also has that very ability. He ls as much an animal, as he ls human. I guess, he can be called a mutant. Mutant? Yes, Krishna. Ancient mythology like Mahabharata and Ramayana had such creatures. Shurpnakha could even change her form. - Hello! - Priya, are you okay? - Yes, why? - I will be late in coming home-. Because one of the attackers ls coming back to consciousness. Once he ls awake perhaps he can help us and we can help him. And, he can tell us who It Is that ls... trying to attempt such a dangerous subversion of laws of nature. Priya! Priya, why did you come here? I was getting scared. No need to be afraid. Krishna, lam afraid. He will kill me. He will kill us-. Do something, Krishna. Get a sedative, Immediately. Papa, you have to kill him-. No, no, you have to kill him, Krishna. It'll be fine, Priya. Priya. - Kill him! Father. Father. That thing..-... he tried to kill me. You saw It, didn't you? If you weren't there to save me... What did lever do to them? Who are these people? What do they want from us? Priya, I can imagine you are disturbed. But, please, calm down. Perhaps we would have got some answers... if he had been alive for longer. But, who are they? And, why are they attacking us? Attacking papa? You think It could be because... papa made an antidote for the virus? Yes, l think so too. You are on the right track. We can't be sure... but, the attack seems to be linked with the virus and the antidote. It seems very probable. That means, they can come back. They can spread the virus again. We'd still be able to save people. But, how? They have burned the lab down. Yes . But we still have the antidote. And If needed, we can make more of It. How? How... papa? Because, Priya, we have-- Papa, I think, her questions won't stop until... you make the antidote In front of her eyes. Because, she Isn't Priya. She ls just a journalist right now. Yes . She is indeed interrogating like a journalist. Because she hasn't been to work for so long... the journalist In her ls trying to surface. That's why, you should resume work from tomorrow, Priya. And right now, you are going to bed. - But, papa... - Let's go. Krishna, let papa tell us. We should know this. There's no telling when we might need it. Father. Listen to me, Krishna. If we come to know how papa makes the antidote... we could help him. This ls very Important. Why don't you understand? I love you. Mr. Mehra, here's your appointment letter. You can join from tomorrow. Thank you, sir. - Ladles and gentleman... It ls now time to announce the names of this week's... ...lucky draw winners, at R City Mall. Today's winner no. 3 who has won Rs. 50,000 ls... Mr. Sachin Gupta. And our second place winner is Mr- Pooja Mishra. And today's jackpot winner, who has won Rs. 100,000... - Thank you. Mrs. Avi Shah. Hey! That's me. Hell?- My baby! MY baby, my baby! Thank you. Thank you. My baby! Thank you! This ls from all of us. What's this? The symbol of Krrish. Anyone who steps up to help another person, ls rewarded with this. Where can I meet Krrish? I do not know that. I just know that he ls always present... ...at the right place, at the right time. And, when he Isn't... kind people like you, take his place. But, what did I do? You did. You have done what any kind person would do. Your good human Instincts saved a child's life... ...and her mother's as well. You don't understand, Krishna. I love you.

Priya, or my Kaya? I need some more time, Kaal. I do not have time. Bring me the information by tomorrow or... Kaal will obtain It by his own means. Doctor, are all the parameters normal? Parameters are normal. The fetus ls healthy and In the right position. Then what ls It still doing In It's mother's womb? Get It out. Right away. But why, Kaal? I want to try Injecting my DNA In Its DNA at this fetal stage... and see what generates. Because, we have not yet conducted any experiments with human fetuses. That's right, Kaal. But, It's too early. Pulling the fetus out right now ls dangerous. It will die. Until the fetus ls three months old... we cannot take It out. Nor, can we conduct any experiments. In fact, we cannot even do a DNA test. How much longer? At least a week, Kaal. Only another seven days. And your nine month long ordeal will come to an end. And perhaps get answers to all my questions. Krishna, where are you? Some startling facts have been revealed, Krishna. At first, we discovered that... the DNA of the antidote supplied by Kaal Pharmaceuticals... ls a match to the DNA of the mutant In our custody. Even more alarming truth ls the fact that... the DNA of the antidote created by us... ls also more or less the same. I did several tests to confirm. Every single time, I get the same result. But, how Is that possible? Because we made that antidote from... - I guess Priya has woken up. - Yes. - About the antidote... - How Is she? She is fine. - The antidote... - Listen... lam leaving for Singapore tomorrow. Take care of yourself and Priya. You are going to Singapore? Why? Because... Singapore, Dr. Arya. and his cruel Intentions... are all an Important part of my past. And, the facts that have surfaced have raised many questions. Perhaps, I can only find the answers by revisiting my past-. - There you are. - What happened? Are you alright? Yes, WNW I don't know. l felt like you were calling out to me from a distance. I am right here with you- Why would I call out to you'? True. Papa had asked for some coffee. He ls still working. But, it's quite late-. Let me go check on him. No. He said he ls working on some Important research. We shouldn't disturb him until morning. Come with me. Come on. Okay, let's go. What's the matter? No. Now, I cannot break Krishna's trust. And... what about Kaal's trust? I will ask him to wait until Rohit Mehra returns from Singapore. Hello. I have found all the answers I was looking for, Krishna. Coming to Singapore was a good move. Singapore? You're In Singapore? When did you leave? Why didn't you tell me? Of course, I did. I told you last night... when you came down to the lab. Last night? When? And I was going to share some more details... but, Priya woke up. Remember? There you are. What happened? You're here with me. But not really here. Shurpnakha could even change her form. If we find out how papa made the antidote for the virus. Krishna, yea have to kill him. She is indeed interrogating like a journalist. Krishna... Krishna... Who are you? Priya. I am Priya Mehra. You are not Priya. Yes, lam. I am Priya-.. Krishna! You aren't Priya. If you were... you would know the truth about Krishna and Krrish. Tell me who you are! Where's my Priya? Your Priya? Yes . Krishna? Yes, Krishna. Your tears might influence Krishna. But, they won't fool Krrish. Where's my Priya? She ls In a safe place. Priya and... your child, too. Believe me, lam telling the truth... to both Krishna and Krrish. Where Is she? Welcome to the world of Kaal, Dr. Rohit Mehra. And, lam sorry... I had to bring you here without your consent. You went to Singapore looking for some answers. Tell me, what did you find? That man should never try to be God. Many years ago, Dr. Arya had held me captive In Singapore. And during that period... he conducted a strange experiment on me. Dr. Mathur... If this experiment ls successful... I will have created a new Rohit Mehra-. From his own blood, his own DNA. With all of Rohit's mental and physical powers... but, controlled entirely by me. Dr. Arya did manage ta create a child using my DNA. But the child turned out to be handicapped. Dr. Arya. Instructed Dr. Mathur to dispose of the baby. But Dr. Mathur couldn't do so. He left the baby In an orphanage Instead. - And... - And then... A rich man adopted the handicapped child. And raised him as his own. That means, the one I always regarded as my father... was not really my father. Because, that handicapped child ls none other than me. And you--. you are my father-. I like It. Everything's going to be alright now. I found you and with you... I found the answers to all my questions. Now I'll find a cure for my condition as well. I just need a little help from you. What help? I need your bone marrow. Bone marrow? You can have It. I will help you. You will have to put an end to what you are doing. You must destroy this little universe you've created. Dad... can l call you dad? Of course I can... yea are my clad indeed-. Dad... no terms and conditions. Doing that will cause you... a lot of grief-. Because then... I will be forced to take the DNA... from the bone marrow of the baby that... Priya ls carrying. Your grandchild. My grandchild? But I thought... - even before she could give-- - No... the baby is alive. Because, Priya is In my custody. Do you want to see her? But... Priya ls... there... That ls not Priya. She ls one of my mutants. Masquerading as Priya. The real Priya ls here and she's safe. Her baby ls healthy. And sols baby's bone marrow. You may feel that we are all alone right now. And hence, you may torture us all you want. But, you don't know the power of a father's tears. That ls why you cannot see him coming. He ls our strength. And he ls the end of you. My real son... Krrish! Are you okay? Yes . Krishna... Kaal is not In this facility. Come In, dad. Look, I have found my feet. - Whereas you... - How do you feel, Kaal? I was talking to my dad. This ls just the beginning. A lot of blood ls yet to be shed. - Yes, Kaal? - Kaya, thank you so much. Because of you, Rohit Mehra ls with me. Come back here, from wherever you are. Come to the facility where I created you-. Aren't you glad to be back In your world? Kaya? Kaal?! Kaya, now you shall bear witness to Kaal's powers. I'm going to destroy humanity... and create a race of powerful creatures. This world belongs to me now. It could have been ours... but, you chose a different path. By betraying me. I knew you would bring Krrish here. And that ls exactly what I wanted you to do. Krrish! You are going to need your tears. Save them... for your father. Sorry, for our father. Yes, we are brothers. Two sons of the same father. The only difference Is that... you are the child born out of love... and, lam the child born out of Dr. Arya's Insanity. Ask him, If you don't believe me. Papa? I have only taken his bone marrow. If he survives... the world will end, Krishna. Dad, you are asking one son to kill your ether son'? I like It. I will gladly fulfill your wish. Krrish, my victory will be marked by death. Your and your child's death. No member of your family will survive. Krishna! Krishna. Look dad, I made your wish come true. Now, I do not even need to kill ye... Because the death of your real son... will finish you too, Rohit Mehra. Krishna... Krishna, get up. Krishna... Krishna! Who are you? Hey, did you get that? The one that you all pin your hopes on. That you depend on. Kaal has destroyed him. I have killed Krrish! What?! Oh my God! Yes, I have made Krrish a martyr-. Now, It's Priya Mehra's turn. So bring her to me. The longer she takes to reach me... the more I will torture you all. A filter with a brain. A filter with a brain. A filter with a brain. Please God. Please God. Krishna, never think you are alone. Because no one ever really dies. The soul... the energy... It only gets transferred from one body to another. Old lives end but return as new lives. Look, Krishna... lam coming back to life within you. Our powers are uniting. We'll always be together. I'll stay alive in you-. And In your memories. And you will forever be In my blessings. What are you doing, Vicky? Vicky, where are you going'? Vicky! Emotional fools. All you silly and helpless people are like Insects to me. An inferior race. One that I can crush anytime. How will you save her? We'll give our lives for her-. No! We'll take his life. I like It. You have quite an attitude for someone so small. So what If I am small? One's courage should be undeterred. Krrish said so. Krrish...ls no more! This ls the era of Kaal Krrish ls the courage within us. And cannot be killed by any Kaal. Krrish will remain alive until the last one cf us is alive. What's the matter, Kaal? Scared? Krishna! Such a wonderful family reunion. Who do I kill first? Father? Or son? Look at yourself. You are just an ordinary human being. An ordinary son. A weak father. Being human is not a weakness... It ls my strength. Because I have the blessing of every father... and the love of every child. Krishna... Surprise! Krishna, get up. Krishna. Only those who are born can die. I was never born. So, lean never die. No matter haw powerful evil is-.. Good will always triumph over It. Krishna, never think you are alone. Because no one ever really dies. We'll always be together. I'll stay alive in you-. And In your memories. And you will forever be In my blessings. Mr. Krishna... Mr. Krishna. Congratulations. It's a boy. You can go In now. I wish papa were here. He ls right here. I have named our son, Rohit. Where did he... He was right here... Where did he... "Whenever there will be dense smoke."
