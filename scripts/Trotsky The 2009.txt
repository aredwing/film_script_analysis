They laughed in the faces of the common man, just as they have for centuries. Now, we need these jobs to be fair and well paid! We need these jobs to stay in our country! We need a union and we need it now! - Fie, six, se-- Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, fie! We deserve to unionize! Whoo! No idea... Why you stopping? Come on! - That's it? - We had 6 hours' notice, Leon. - l know, l know. - Sarah! Leon! Lunch! - We're not breaking the strike line, Ma! - Who's breaking anything? Maybe you don't wanna nosh? - lt's a hunger strike, Ma! Jesus! - l heard that. Don't swear. - Leon. - Yeah, it's good! - chmed! Dude! - Sorry, Leon. l'm starving. - You're killing me here. What are you eating? You're supposed to be my right-hand man. - l know, bro. l--l'm sorry. - Last chance for tuna salad! Lots of mayo like someone likes! - Please, stop it, Ma! - Well, he's eating! - l know, but he's not supposed to. - Leon! What-- - Oh, shit! - Sorry, sir, you can't go through. - No, that's my son. He wants to close my factory. - Leon! Leon! What you doing? - Negotiations with management have closed. - Closed! When were they ever opened? - Hi, Daddy! - What are you-- What is-- You're cheerleading? For what? For--for your brother becoming psychotic? nna! - l came straight from tennis, honey. - What is that? What do you have there? What is that, food? You brought food? - They're still growing. They have to eat. - Very embarrassing. - My own wife... - Calme-toi, mon chri. - ...is bringing a picnic for Stalin over here who wants to destroy my business! - l have nothing but contempt for Stalin, as you well know. - Uh... You have kids? Oui? Eh bien, O.K.. - Union! Union! Union! - Here's what we're gonna do. - Hey! - l know you want to start down here with the workers and all that stuff, but in a week or so when you get bored out of your mind, don't be proud. You come upstairs to the office and l'll show you how the business really works, all right? - We'll see. - This is where your grandfather started. Right here on the floor, just like you. ln 3 years, he bought the business. lsn't that something? Why don't you come upstairs? lt's nicer upstairs. Come on! - lt's just-- lt's a bit too soon to align myself with, uh, with management. You do understand. - lign yourself... ...with management. You know what? l'm not gonna even try to... Whatever you say, Leon. You start here, do whatever you want. - Wait! David, where is our union-- - Don't call me David. You know it makes me uncomfortable. - Fine. Uh, Dad? - Thank you. - Where's our union representative? - You know that we have no union. We've never had one. - l'm sorry. What? - Why do you pretend that-- - This is a travesty! - chmed! Listen, this is my son Leon. He is anxious to plumb the depths of the packing department. Why don't you show him what to do, where to start? lf you have any problems whatsoever, you come upstairs and you talk to me. Uh, chmed, you have any problems with him whatsoever, you come upstairs and you talk to me, all right? Uh, good job. You're wasting a little plastic, but you'll get better at it. - Fascist. - What did you say? - Uh, fascist. He's a fascist. What is he? - Fascist. - Thank you. - chmed, l heard that. - Remember? My God, remember when we had the unions? - Uh, what is everybody still doing here? Shipping deadline is at 4:00! l don't think we're gonna make it. - We're still on lunch. - xcuse me? - We demand a full hour for a lunch break. lt's only been 56 minutes. - Uh... Uh, Leon... l wonder if l could trouble you. l'm sorry to interrupt. Do you mind just giving me just a couple of minutes of your time up in the office to discuss something? - You exploit your employees. - How? y employing them? - y running a business without any standardized labour laws in place, you, David, are acting as an agent of sabotage against all working people across the globe. - Sabotage? What do you call talking my guys into missing a shipping deadline! - Progress. - You know what? l am not responsible for workers in the world everywhere. l am responsible for keeping this company in profit! - So this is how it happens. - How what happens? - How it ends between you and me, landowner. - What? Land-- Landowner? l lease the land! l don't know what you're talking about! - l'm not staying. l'm just here to collect my books. - Where you going? - Why? So you can let the police know, and have them arrest me again? - Why don't we have a conversation? - xpect a conversation with my lawyer. - Your what? Your lawyer? re we getting a divorce? Who gets custody of the child? Oh, wait! You're the child. - So how was jail? - rutal, in a word. ut, uh, l'm out. l can't go back right now. Next year, though. Jail. Fingers crossed. - So what are we thinking long term? - Oh, l don't know. Cuba or maybe... Caracas, Venezuela. l think Hugo would take me in. - Hugo would love you. - This is what l'm saying. - eep your voices down. You're gonna wake your father. w! - What are we thinking short term? - l don't know. Crash at a youth hostel or something. - youth hostel? - Stay in a hotel. - Mais voyons donc! - Stay in a hotel. - Well, l can't afford it. Dad cut me off! - Completely? - Yes. - What a Nazi. - Don't call your father a Nazi. - Well, he is a Nazi! - Don't say that word! - Whatever, Ma. You're not even Jewish. - Hey! Sarah! You're Jewish enough for me. - You're proud of yourself? Teaching your sister to talk that way? - l didn't say anything! - You don't have to. She doesn't talk that way when you're not around. - Makes perfect sense. She's never said "Nazi." - l don't want to hear that word in my house! - Freedom of speech is an inalienable right that you, sir, have neither the authority nor the wherewithal to do away with! - Stop yelling! - ls it gonna be every summer he comes home, he turns my daughter against me? - Oh, David! - Dad. - l don't have to turn anybody against you! - l see. - They're free to see the face of oppression! - The oppression that pays for school? - l hate that boarding school. - Suddenly, you hate the school. - Suddenly? l always hated that school. - Words have consequences. l hope you're prepared for that. - Leon? - l'm leaving. l'm leaving. - Can you just wait a minute, please? He's so upset when you fight! - Oh, don't defend him! - Fine. O... l want you to take this. - l--l told you! - lt's not Daddy's! lt's mine. You're my only stepson that l love. nd it's gonna kill me if l think that you're sleeping in a shelter with homeless people peeing on you. - Homeless people peeing on me? - Yeah. - Jesus. Yeah, O.., Ma. - O... Oh, t'es fin! T'es fin! l want you to do me another favour. - Mm-hmm? - l want you to come on Friday for Shabbat. - Oh! l... l--l--l don't want to eat with that man. - For me. Do it for me. Please? - l'll make all your favourites. - Shepherd's pie? - Oui. Merci, mon chou. - l love you very much, mom. e careful. - Bien sr. - O..? - Hmm. - Thank you very much for not pissing on me. - xcuse me, sir. re you Frank McGovern? - Yeah. - Oh, l'm so glad you're here. - l'm not here. l'm leaving. l'll be back this afternoon. - Oh, no, no, no. Uh, we need to talk now. Um, unfortunately, neither of us has any choice in the matter. lt's fate. l mean it's... not just that the conditions were deplorable, which they were, believe you me. Certain people weren't being given a full hour for lunch, let alone any semblance of a break. l mean, are we in the industrial revolution? Have these people never heard of the Reform ill of 1832? This is all to say - that each of these ills seem - union. - nd so you staged a hunger strike? - Yes, l did. perfectly legal hunger strike. fter which l was detained illegally at the urging of my father. - nd now you wanna-- - Sue him. - For? - l don't know. What are my options? l'm thinking, uh, wrongful imprisonment, false arrest? l--l--l'm not sure. You see, this is why l need council. - No, l don't know how l can help you, kid. l haven't practiced law in 20 years. - Yeah, that's right, not since the concentrator and pellet facility closed down in Sept-les in 1982. - Right. ut l still don't think you need a lawyer. - Oh yes, l do. nd l need it to be you. - lt's Leon, right? - Yes, sir. - Well, Leon, you're half right. You need counselling. ut you haven't got a case against your father. Sorry. - This isn't over. - Yeah, it is. - What would your colleagues of the Communist Party of Canada, which you led from 1971 to 1982, think of you turning me down? - You're following me? - Maybe. - Go home. - ln your Ph. D. dissertation, you stated that the dialectic is only growing... that the illusion of the middle class will die and that a new leadership will rise from the ashes of that dream. - My writing isn't that flowery. - l am that leadership! What about your fellow Vietnam War draft dodgers? What about taking haven in this country and in turn becoming the chief architect and guinea pig for our extradition laws! Don't you feel an obligation to see our labour laws progress further? - l'm this far away from calling the cops, Leon. - l'm not freaked-out about finishing my Ph. D. Maybe l don't want to go back to being a Federal prosecutor. - Oh, for Christ's sake! - Please take my case! - You have no case to take, Leon. - How-- What the hell happened to you? - Get up off the street! - h! l see... Have you, uh, turned into one of those people? - Sorry, lexandra. - You Menshevik! - This is Leon. - Wait, wait! Stop, stop, stop, stop. oth of you. You. Uh, what is your name? - lexandra. - ls she making that up? - Why would anyone do that? - Uh, yeah, yeah. How old are you? - How old are you? - Uh, 17 and three quarters. Give or take. How old are you? - l'm a whole 27. - Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh, my god! lt's happening. lt's happening. So it's happening. - What's happening, Leon? - Uh, l think l'm gonna throw up. - What are you talking about? - O.., you see, ever since l first heard about him, when l was a little boy, and then as l got older, l swear to you more and more things started making sense. nd now, this... This whole... - Uh... - This is... What l'm about to say to you, l've never said aloud, aside from when l'm pretending that Gourevitch is interviewing me for The Paris Review. Uh... So, uh... l'm the reincarnation of Leon Trotsky. Uh, and you and l are gonna get married. Nice to meet you. - Leon! Leon! l think it might be better if you just let her go. - Really? Huh. Fair enough. l mean it's, uh, it's inevitable anyways, so... - Right. - Yeah. Leon? Supper. - One minute. - Oh, come on. You can finish your little revolution after you eat. - Please stop reading my journal! - Well, l figured out why you're gonna marry him. - Did he tell you? No! l looked it up. Listen to this here. "Long before Leon Trotsky and Lenin stormed into Russia "and created the first communist state in 1917..." - Hey, Tiger. l'm not in your first year World History survey class. l know who Trotsky was. - Fine, then l guess you know that Trotsky's first wife was named lexandra, right? - ig deal. - And that she was 9 years older than he, and that they were introduced by a man named Franz... something Czech... who hosted politically-themed garden parties in iev, where Trotsky-- then of course still Leon Bronstein-- went to school. - Come on... - l'm reading it out of the biography. You can borrow it. - No, thanks. - You should. - It's kind of creepy. - Yeah. - Creepy, funny, harmless. - For now, until he starts stalking me. nd l get the vibe that's right up his alley. What's so funny? - lt's just that apparently lexandra hated Leon when she first met him. - Hmm. lt's so nice to have you back, Leon. lt's always so nice when the whole family is here for Shabbat. - Yeah, you're always such a pleasure, Leon. - l hate you, li. - Go home, li. Just go. - See, this is my dad's home too, which means it's my home. So l can't really go home, but nice try. - li. - What? - You're unbelievable. - She started it. l'm just-- O... Sarah, can you stop? For God's sake. - - Yeah. - Shh! - How's the brisket? - lt's dry. - lt's pretty good for a shiksa, Mom. - li! - What? - Dad, make him stop please! - Sarah! - l have a question for you. Leon, you recognize this, don't you? My Life, by Leon Trotsky. - How--how did you-- Uh, have l been betrayed so soon? - Leon! - You are such a dipshit. - Can you not act your age? - l am. - For God's sake! - Now, circa 1860 or so... l just can't find where your Leon went to a boarding school in here. - lt wasn't at a boarding school. lt was a public school with a liberal arts emphasis. - Oh, of course. l'm sorry. - l'm sorry. - Of course it was a public school. Let me get it straight. lt's a little confusing. So this Leon's father, he didn't have to pay for his son's-- What would you call it? lngratitude? lnsensitivity? - Delusion? - How dare you? - l am just asking a question. - O.., wait. sk my lawyer! - Just calm down, Leon. - Your what? - l'm calm! - Will you stop? - No, he's passionate! You believe in something. You have a hero... - Please stop, David! lt's upsetting him! - He's a great man. Look how thick the book is. ut listen, you want to be just like him? l'm gonna make it really easy for you. This coming fall, you, Leon, just like this Leon, will be going to public school. - l didn't say anything to him, l swear to-- re you O..? - Oh, yeah, yeah! No, l'm, uh... lt's a good idea. lt's--it's gonna be good for me. l... l love public stuff. This is public school. With all the public people. - Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. Just like you asked. - Oh, great! Thank you. - Why do you want these? - Oh, uh, my destiny. Card 4. - Oh. - O... Um, hello there. Uh, this is my first day here. l believe l'm meant to ask you where my homeroom is. - Name? - Leon ronstein. - Leon ronstein? Principal erkhoff, this is Leon ronstein. - Leon ronstein. We've been waiting for you. - h! Well, in that case, l'll tell you that l don't have a tremendous amount of experience with public schools, but l've decided that l'm going to like it. - Good! l think you'll find this is not like most public schools. l like to run a pretty tight ship. - l respond passionately to structure, so... - Then we should get along just fine. - h! - Your homeroom and schedule are in there. nd that's the activities board if you care about that stuff. - Oh, shit. - Oh god. Oh my god! l'm sorry. We thought you were a teacher. - Yeah, man. Uh, close the door. - h! Um, are you people the, uh, union representatives that l sign in with? - The union representatives? Uh, sure. - Uh, do you want to help with the dance? - l want to join the union. - re you new? - l get it. You think this is like-- you think this is like a union, like--like the Teamsters. - Oh! No. No. No, no, no. That--that's not us. - No, no. This is just like student's council. Like, uh... Ha! l don't know. council? lt's not a union. That's just the name. - ll right, well, uh, what sort of legislative powers do you guys have as a council? - Uh, none. - Uh, the power to organize a dance. You want to help? Skip. How did you manage to get mud on your shoes? lt hasn't rained for days. - Oh, um, l don't know. Sorry, Ms. Davis. - pologize to me in detention this afternoon. - ctually, l have to go to the orthodontist this afternoon. - Perhaps, you should have thought of that before you walked into my school with muddy shoes. Welcome back, Skip. - God! She's such a bitch! l can't believe she's already started on me. - ls it actual school policy that you can't have muddy shoes in the hallways? - Um. - Yeah, l'll go to detention with you. Solidarity. - ll right, everyone! - O... - Class started 2 minutes ago. - Oh, Jimmy! Fuck! - Welcome back. How was your summer? Tuck in your shirt. See you in detention. Sheila! Sheila, take that thing out of your nose. You are not a bull. - Sorry, Ms. Davis. - pologize in detention. nd don't act like a hussy! - What a cunt! - Fascist. - Since this is the first day of detention, l requested to be the supervisor so that you would all know just how bad it can be. ll which to say, you don't want to be here, l don't want you to be here, so shape up and don't come back. - Um, Ms. Davis? Since it's the first day of school and we don't really have any homework, can we just read? - No. l brought math with me. - Hi there! Sorry l'm late. l had trouble finding your place. Hi, you guys. How's it going? l know you. - What is your name? - Oh! Uh, l don't have detention. Uh, l'm just here in protest. l took the liberty of reading up on the school-board regulations vis--vis, uh, detention. nd, uh, mud isn't in there. Neither are, uh, nose rings for that matter. nd between you and me, it is the first day of school, you probably could've let the shirt thing slide. How are you? re you well? - Young man! l don't know who you think you are-- - Leon ronstein. l am the reincarnation of Leon Trotsky. nd if you give Skip or any other student another unjustifiable detention again, you and l are going to have a very serious problem, Mrs... l'm sorry. What was your name? - So, we're celebrating tonight, and by celebrating, l mean you actually have to leave your house. - Oh, no, we're not. We are doing nothing tonight. - No! l told Lucy l'd get you drunk. Don't make me a liar. - Stop emailing my mother. - l like your mother. - You can have her. Oh shit! - Oh my God! ls that your future husband? - Um... - Hi, honey! - Don't leave me. This could get ugly. Not funny. Not funny. What are you doing here? - Um... Congratulations on defending your thesis! - l don't want to see you. - Why not? - Uh, you frighten me. l think you're crazy. - ut l love you. - Wow! O.., uh, l think l'm gonna leave now. - Uh, please don't. - Call me later. - l won't. - nd, um, it was very nice to meet you. - Thank you. l think so. - O... - Oh! Say hi to Julian for me. - Hi. Uh, could... Could we please go, um, and have coffee together? Um... Please don't say anything mean to me anymore. - Stop asking me to marry you, O..? Seriously, it freaks me out. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Fine. Fine. Fine. - Was that a no? No. Hey! That was a joke! That was sort of a joke! - Thank you. - Thank you. So you really think that you're the same person as Leon Trotsky? - Yes. - nd you think that you're gonna live out his life exactly as it happened to him, ice pick and all? - Correct. - Well, my limited knowledge of Trotsky involves, a lot of travelling and a lot of assassination attempts. - Have you been reading up on him? - What l mean is that it's a lot to live up to. - Uh... l actually like to look at it as a lot to look forward to. - Well, for a Marxist, you'd make a great Hindu. - What? Oh... Well, Terry agleton encourages us to let Marxism breathe in our new century by allowing for things which arl Marx, frankly, had no opinion on, by letting the guidelines of the Great Dialectic, or the Grand Narrative, guide us towards moral and not moralist thinking. - Was that "gobbledeegook?" - Hells no. - l didn't think so. - So his name is Julian? - No, he's making it up. - nd, uh... How heartbroken will Julian be when you break up with him for me? - So, l'm that-a-way and the bus stop is that-a-way. - Yeah. l know. - Good night. - Night. - This is the end of our date. - Oh, l know. l'm just staring at how beautiful you are. l thank you for a very lovely evening. - Uh... - Sit down. So, are you enjoying public school as much as you hoped that you would? - Uh, see, it's all very exciting. Um, too bad about all the fascists, though. - xcuse me? - Oh, the fascists, like Ms. Davis over here. Uh, if it wasn't for them, l'd be having a fantastic time. nd the kids are great, like that gentleman Skip. Skip seems really nice. - He says that he doesn't actually know you. - That is correct. - ut you know him? - No. - So you were just demonstrating solidarity with him? - Yes, that's right. - Do you understand why you've been given detentions for the rest of the week? - Yes, l believe for insolence. - You're damn right. - Ms. Davis. Leon... l don't think l've properly educated you on the twin subjects of who l am and what l'm about. - l think l've got a pretty clear idea. - l don't think that you do. This has been a troubled arts school for many years now. Pot, sex, graffiti, piercings. You see what l'm getting at? l am here to discipline the students, usher in a new era of responsibility and obligation to this place. Now, you can certainly make that harder for me. Heck, you already have. ut you won't stop me. So the choice is yours. You can spend your final year of high school in a war you can't win against a man who's lived far longer and knows far more than you. - Hmm. - Or you can just float by and wreak havoc next year on someone's poor, unsuspecting university. What's it going to be? - l think the choice is obvious. - Why was this war so important that people were coming from all over the world to Spain to volunteer for it? Does anyone care? nyone other than Leon? Orwell, Hemingway, famous writers, lots to lose, coming all the way to Spain! They had nothing to do with it. The POUM, the very first all-volunteer army. You, in your little lives here, would you volunteer yourselves to go to a foreign country, somewhere that you've never been before, somewhere where you know no one? Can you imagine doing something so selfless? Dan! Can you please turn your smirking face towards the front? Thanks. Where was l? - l'm so bored. - Well, you're a fruit. nd why are we in the hallway? Why don't we go somewhere where we could smoke? - l'd second that motion, but l'm afraid it might sound too fruity, twat. - Ladies! lt's a dance theme. How hard can this be? - Pfft! - O.., so the next suggestion, whatever it is, that's what we're doing, O..? - Hi! Hi! Sorry. Sorry we're late. Double time. Double time. - Who's this? - Guys, this is Leon and his friend... - Skip. His name is Skip. - Skip! Uh, guys, this is Dwight, president of the Student Union. - nd--and--and-- and who are you? - Dwight! - What's the big deal? What grade are you in, Skippy? - 9. - 9! Great! - Wow! - ll the grades should be represented in the union. Right, Tony? - Right. Do you guys have any ideas for the theme of a dance? lt's in 2 weeks and it's kind of crunch time. - Social justice? - ll right! This meeting's adjourned! - What? Uh, no, no. No, that's not our theme! That's not our theme. - Oh, yeah Caroline said the next one mentioned was gonna be the theme, so that's it, right? - Hum, l guess so. - O.., an elected committee member has to suggest it. Not.... some outsider. - re you my Stalin, Dwight? - Ha! O..! So l suggest social justice. Let's fucking go. - Yeah, well you-- - "re you my Stalin, Dwight?" ln fact, l want that on a T-shirt. - Heh! - No, wait. That should be my first album name: "My Stalin." ls it a better band name or album name? - l don't know. - Can l ask you guys something? Would you say "boredom" or "apathy"? - Well, what's the difference? - oredom. - pathy's the condition of not caring. oredom... boredom is just a slumber one can be roused from. - Oh, then definitely boredom. - See, l told you. - Gang... Do you guys want to form a real union? - Why? - We have no voice. We have no, uh, defence in this large, impersonal establishment that maintains it's here for our edification, and yet seems hell-bent on thwarting our individual and collective growth at every turn. Teachers and administration are here for us. nd yet we are the most undervalued members of the education community. We have lots of power, we just haven't used it yet. - re we gonna get in trouble for this? - Probably. Heh! - Principal erkhoff claims there's a new sheriff at Montreal West High School. ully for him! - What is this fucking idiot talking about? Why don't you try listening to him? - Let's show him what the townspeople are made of. Let's show him that we are not the generation of apathy. - l love everything you're saying. Oh, sing it, sister! Yeah! - If we don't think we deserve a detention, shouldn't we be allowed to bring that query to a review board of sorts? We are entitled to fight unfair rules. a time for learning or a time for revolution. - Oh, mon Dieu! Frank? - For one young man, the answer is both. - Frank, come here. You gotta see this. - What? - My fellow students, aren't you tired of being taught ecology by gym teachers? - Oh, for Christ's sake! - While school officials have yet to comment, it seems like this semester is shaping up... - Should l Febreeze your robes? - You know what else isn't funny anymore? - esides your ring tone? - Yeah, you. Hello? - Turn on the news. - Why? - You'll see. - The commissioner's on vacation this week... - Oh my god! - Hold on a second. l got the other line. Hold on. Hello? - Uh, hey. lt's Leon. - Hang on. - Yeah, O... - Did you give Leon my number? - Uh... - Oh, my god! Hold on. What is wrong with you? - Why? Was l not supposed to call? - No, l'm talking about the-- the school thing! re you watching the news, Leon? - Oh, that. That's just local coverage. Listen, uh, what are you doing tomorrow night? - l'm busy. re you really trying to unionize your high school? - Uh, yes. Uh, what are you busy with? - lt's my Ph. D. party. Did you tip off the press? - Uh, no. My sister did that. What time does your Ph. D. party finish? - Late. What is wrong with you? - l'm Trotsky. Uh, how late is late? - Um, we're not seeing each other tomorrow night, so... - ut tomorrow is our anniversary. - Mmm, we don't have an anniversary. - Yes, we do. lt's a week tomorrow that we first met. - O.., l'm gonna talk to you later. nd l don't want to be your one phone call from jail. - So, l'll just pop by your place tomorrow night, then? - You will the fuck not, seriously. - Smells good in here. - How's your boyfriend? l forgot. l'm your boyfriend. - Yeah, sometimes l forget too. - Congratulations, Doctor. - Whoa! - Thank you! - ravo. - Merci! Oh... - You didn't call me-- - l'm not talking to you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! You didn't call me back. You left me hangin' there. What did that Leon have to say? - You guys are terrible! Leave her alone. - lt is not my fault that he has a crush on me, O..? - Well, how's Julian doing with the old competition? - Yeah, it's none of his business anymore. - Whoa, whoa! ls there something l should know? - Yeah, she kicked him out yesterday. - Shit, is he here? - Let her have a drink or two. - l can hear you. - Thank you. - Oh, merci! - Good night, girls. - Merci, Marie. Good night. - l love her! - l totally "effed" an 18 year old. - Yeah, so did l, when l was 14. - No, l mean like recently. - Shut your "fugly" face. - No, l did! - Who? - Remember that kid l was tutoring? - You didn't! Timmy? l did. - How am l only hearing about this now, whore? What was it like? - Uh, well, let's put it this way. They fuck you very quickly but a lot. - Really? - He came so many times l lost count. - That's disgusting. - You are so horny for that kid. - No. - Yes, you are. - l gotta kind of move this face back to... You son of a bitch. Oops. Oh shit! - Thanks. Ouch. Ouch, ouch. - Sorry, l thought you were a burglar. - No, you didn't. - No, clearly l thought you were a cartoon character. l'm sorry. No one's ever broken into my house before. - Congratulations on your Ph. D. - You're so fucking nuts, Leon. - Please! Nah, don't say that. You don't actually think that, do you? 'Cause... l don't usually care of what anybody thinks of me. Obviously. Um, but... l'm just very determined. Oh. Oh please, God. No. Oh, fuck. - Uh, hi there. l--l took the liberty of making up some coffee. l hope that's O... - lt's fine. - Here you go. l love you. - l don't do sugar. - O... - What time is it? - lt's 9:53. We have to leave pretty soon. l was entertaining the idea of trying to wake you up myself. - Where are we going? - Uh, E Talk. - What? - l already told you. My E Talk Daily interview. l'm due there in about 45 minutes. So, uh... Do you think you need a shower? - l said l would go? - Hi. - obby! - Don't be nervous. - Oh, l'm not. l'm not. l just didn't think it would actually be you conducting the interview. - l'm flattered. - That's not what l meant. - en, we're ready in 5, - Today, we are talking to an extraordinary young man named Leon ronstein. Leon staged a massive strike at his father's Montreal factory this summer to try to unionize the workers there. nd now, he's doing the same thing at his high school in Montreal West. Welcome, Leon. - Uh, thank you, en. lt's an honour to be here. - Let's start with a question l think most people would want to ask you first. Why do you think high school should be unionized? - Uh, l think we deserve a voice. l mean, teachers have a union to ensure that their rights are protected. l think we deserve the same. Uh, just think. Had there been a student union in, say, Newfoundland, we never would've had the boys of St. Vincent. - Uh, um, l'm sorry. re you saying that there's sexual abuse at your high school? - Oh, no, no, no. l'm merely being hyperbolic to prove a point. l'd say the bulk of today's adolescents tend to feel that they have no one to talk to. Now imagine, if you will, a review board of peers to listen to set issues and assess them accordingly. - O... So, so you want a union to try to help students deal with feelings of alienation? - Well, kind of, en. l think that a large part of the reason why today's youth seems so disaffected-- are so disaffected-- is because they really have so little control... - re you his mother? - ...over the major aspects of their day-to-day lives. - l'm his lawyer. - l--l think my last question for you is this: Why you? Why did Leon ronstein take up this cause? - Uh, well, l'm not sure if you're aware of this, en, but Leon ronstein is actually the birth name of Leon Trotsky. - Can we cut? Cut! Couper! Stop the tape. Um, don't say that, Leon. Just don't. - Wait, don't say what? Don't say what? - h, come on, lex. l have to be true to myself. - On E Talk? - Who are you? - She's my-- - Lawyer, en. l am his lawyer. nd l don't want him talking to you anymore. Come on. - Now? - Done. - l'm sorry, en. - l was trying to help you. - l know. - Listen, um, l don't think you should come back to my place. - Why not? - ecause we can't. l... Last night was wrong. l--l was drunk. nd l didn't know what l was doing. - So, what the hell are you afraid of? Huh? Letting somebody love you? - Oh, Jesus, you're schmaltzy. No, Leon, l'm afraid of who will play me in the TV movie about us. - ut it's fate. lt's not up to us. - O.., l don't live my life that way. l can't. nd l can't do this either, so... l'm sorry if l led you on. - Fine. Fine... No. No. No. - l'll get out. - l'm still in love with you, O..? You don't get a say in that. - ids, eh? Don't Don't talk down To me Don't Don't talk down To me Your head is moving side to side Our temperatures rise I hear the devil outside You're heading north Well I'm heading south Well I hope the words are right When they leave your mouth Oh Well I'm better off now Oh - Have fun. One second. - Take it. Run. ring me back a drink. - Uh, O... - lt's me again. Hi. - Come on, students, it's your future. Face it! Join the movement. O.., so, uh... Who are you, guys? - We're nimal Farm. - He's Clover. Hello? - O.., that is too much effort. lt's high school. nd you're a pig. - Correct. - O... Hey, uh... How's the count? - lt's good. lt's uh, 300 signatures thus far. - Wow! That's great. - lt's incredible. - Leon? - w, great! - girl dressed as yn Rand just told me that you threw her out. - Yeah. nd? - Why? - This is a fascist-free zone, Dwight. Maybe you should leave as well. - O.., yeah. Throw another fucking kid out, Leon, and you are next. - O... asy, Dwight. ll right? yn snuck back in. She's in the gym. - Yeah, Dwight, go back to the candy stand. - What you say, Skippy? - Oh god. - You wanna fucking die? - O.., please, Dwight. We are trying to work. - Well, fuck you, man! - wesome! Please go. - Hi! - Hi! - l'm not gonna stay long. - What? Yes, yes, you are. Yes, you are. You're going to have fun. Skip! This is my sister, Sarah. Sarah, this is Skip. Sarah doesn't know anyone here, so why don't you ask her to dance and talk to her and stuff like that? - You wanna dance? - Sure. - Thank you. - You're an interesting guy, Leon. - Thank you. - Oh! Hello, gorgeous! Oh, hey! re you the girl who spiked the punch? - Mmm! No, l just got here. - Oh, man! l'm trying to figure out who to thank. Whoo! l totally have to date this DJ. nyway, you two kids have fun, O..? ye! l'm going this way! - Uh-huh. - nd now all the party people are here. - Oh, uh, please don't spoil it for me. Let me venture a guess. You are the Ceausescus! Oh no, wait a second. lt's--it's got to be, uh, Oliver Stone and an sian woman? m l getting warmer? - Very clever, Leon. - Uh-huh. - So, social justice, eh? lnteresting theme. - Mm-hmm! Whose idea was that, l wonder? - Uh, l actually tabled the idea. - ls there no little devil whispering in your ear, Tony? - Caught you on E Talk the other day, Leon. You're getting pretty famous. - Well, as long as the cause receives the appropriate attention. - You watch E Talk, sir? - That's right. l do. nyhoo, we need to have a meeting with you and l guess with you, Tony, and anyone else who wants to come along, about your so-called movement. Monday. fter school. - l'll be there. - l was speaking with the school board on Friday about your little cause. Just so you know, it might be getting a lot of attention from the media but it will never happen. - ls that it? - Wait a minute. What do you mean it's never gonna happen? - Yeah, we have over - Comrades, comrades by even talking to this brown shirt, you're--you're--you're merely, uh, encouraging him. He truthfully has very little power; he's only trying to scare us. - Mr. ronstein, l actually have a lot of power and l happen to be wearing a grey shirt. - Caroline, will you please tell Mr. erkhoff that the next time l'll be speaking with him will be at the school board meeting in the presence of the Student Union legal team. - You won't be allowed into the meeting, Leon. dministration only. - Well, we'll see about that. nd that amounts to a threat, does it not, saying that they won't let it happen? - O.., O... When is this meeting gonna take place? - Tomorrow afternoon. Thank you. - t the school board? With the commissioner there? - Yes. nd one other teensy little thing. Uh, technically, we are not allowed to be there. So we're crashing the party, in the grand olshevik tradition of crashing everything. - l presumed you've alerted the media. - Yeah, of course. l figured since you used to be married to Commissioner rchambault-- Speaking of which, l saw the pictures from that wedding. - Hey. Leon. - How drunk was Maggie Trudeau? - Leon. - What? - l'm not a prop. - What do you mean? - l won't show up any time you want me just to lend you some credibility. - l don't need credibility. - You don't need a lawyer either. - Leon. - l'm here on business, l promise you. - What business? - Uh, legal stuff. Tomorrow afternoon, there's a school board meeting. - l can't. - Why not? - ecause l can't! l'm not your lawyer. - O.., fine, let's just... ...put our love aside for a moment and deal with the cause, O..? - "Our love," Leon? "Our love" is something you made up in your head, O..? l don't love you. nd, seriously, you should think long and hard about whether or not you love me, because l don't think you do. - w! You are a coward. - Oh, fuck you, Leon! l'm allowed to feel used when someone is using me. - You think l'm using you? - Of course l do! You are! - l had no idea you had such a poor opinion of me. - Oh, my god! nough with the broken-hearted puppy-dog routine. You just feel things because you think you're supposed to. You've never had a real emotion in your life. You need to grow up. - w! God, l hate that fucking dream! - Students. - Press corps! See you guys after our meeting. lt shouldn't be more than... 10. How's tricks? - You're wasting your time, Mr. ronstein. - Uh, funny. l feel like l'm wasting yours. So, uh, see you guys inside? Lovely. Lovely ensemble. - l notice there's some new faces here. - Uh, Denise... They bullied their way into this meeting. - Oh, and how exactly were you bullied, Harry? Were you swarmed? Let's get this over with so we can get into the real business of this meeting. Let me guess. Monsieur ronstein will speak on behalf of this group? - Uh, yes. That's right, Denise. l assume you already know why we're here. l have in my hand more than 578 signatures of students from my high school who wish to unionize. - nd l wonder how you got those signatures, Monsieur ronstein. y pretending it was for installing a Jacuzzi in the hallway? - l see that l'm encountering that legendary school board wit that l've heard so much about. Uh, in that case, l'll just get down to business. Uh, we're here because Henry erkhoff and his... demonic concubine, Davis... - You won't get anywhere with insolence, Monsieur ronstein. - Thus, we have come before you... ...oh great and powerful Oz, in search of understanding and/or benevolence. What say you? - lnsolence again, Monsieur ronstein. You know, perhaps you are not the best spokesperson for your cause. En tout cas... What a fucking surprise. - xcuse me? - This is a formality, Madame. mere formality. Did you honestly think that any of us believed that you would actually take us seriously? You and your, uh, junta school board are more predictable than a Congolese dictator. Uh, no, we are only here to give the impression that we were willing to talk sensibly before raining down a hellfire of shit on your legacy! - Monsieur ronstein! l spent today as l spend most days... working for the Stephen Lewis Foundation trying to convince pharmaceutical companies to donate lDS drugs to otswana. So you'll excuse me if l have low tolerance for your histrionics. - l'm sincerely sorry that our little cause isn't dramatic enough for you. Let's go, gang. Downstairs, we have a press conference awaiting us. - Un instant, s'il te plat, Monsieur Bronstein. l can only assume you're planning a strike of some kind. ut l must warn you, this is not your daddy's factory; this is the government. Do you know what happens to government workers who strike illegally? They go to jail. - What you seem to forget, Madame, is that we are not government employees, we are not your employees. We are students. Just like those students in that square in China. nd my name is Mr. Trotsky. Leon Trotsky. Adieu. - Here we go. - l'll do the wrap later. - What was that? 'cause l don't want to go to jail. - Yeah, l'm not too crazy about that idea either. l mean, detentions suck and all, but l bet getting gang-raped by prison guards sucks harder. - Nobody's going to jail! They're just trying to distract us. Sarah, l think it's time for the sympathy strike. - l've already been laying down the foundations. - You have? - Yeah. - Wow. - ll right, l'm gonna deal with the press. fternoon, press corps. We're calling for a school-board-wide strike of all students at 11:30 a.m., Eastern standard time. Tomorrow morning, students, walk out of class. Walk into the streets and we will show them that we are alie, we are awake, we are aware. Uh, Leon, why exactly are you doing this strike? - We are striking over self-determination. How's that? Beliee it or not, yes, our educational environment is important to us. So once again, students, let this strike commence. - Idle threats orjust the beginning, we'll find out-- - Leon, maybe you'd like to share with the family how you're adapting to your new public school? No? Come on! Nothing interesting, nothing provocative happened, nothing worthy of your attention? Today, for instance? - You are so fucking busted, dipshit. - One son at a time. - Sarah, will you please remind your father that l'm not speaking with him. - Leon says-- - Oh, of course! ecause of this historical record here. Your Leon stopped talking to his father at exactly your age. lsn't that right? ls it? Just nod your head vaguely in my direction. did Leon Trotsky make his whole family the laughing stock of the city? - lt's half the city. The French don't care. - You live in the West lsland! - ctually, Dollard. - Just so that l know what to expect between us, Leon, you mind telling me what chapters l can skip, so l can get to the relevant parts? 'Cause most of this is incredibly boring! - David! - Stop reading that book. - Why? l'm finding out so much about both of you. - Well, it's too late! You can't wake up one morning and decide now to take an interest in my life! Goddamn it! l'm not supposed to be talking with you! - Oh, poor baby! - l asked you not to talk about this. - Dad, he's totally out of control. - li! - What? He's my brother. l can say what l want. Leon, are you O..? Come and have dessert, honey. - Come on, Toronto. Don't let me down. Hello? ls this Mr. Ulianov? ls this Mr. Vladimir Ulianov? lt's ei-- lt's either your name or it isn't, sir. lt's a simple question. Fantastic. How old are you, sir? l understand why you think it's none of my business, but humour me? You're 73. That's, uh... Your children should come to visit you more often. O.., O..... Yeah? Hello, ma'am. l'm looking for Vladimir Ulianov. That's you. Hello? ls your name Vladimir Ulianov? No? Thank you! Thanks for nothing. - Yes? The eagle has landed. - Thank you. - Can't believe he wants us to leave. - re you gonna do it? - Yeah, probably... So are you gonna walk out at 11:30? Yeah. - Good morning, gentlemen. Oof! Not for you, it isn't. - ll right, how much trouble do you think we'll get in for doing this? - Dwight! - What? l have a right to know. - You're not going to get in trouble. l've already taken the fall. Listen. Have we gotten the word out? Does everybody know? ls this going to happen? - verybody is talking about it, so everybody knows. The only thing l'm worried about is that no one will want to be the first person to walk out. - l know but they'll hear us in the hallways. That'll put some hair on their balls. We're gonna be fine. - l don't like this. - Then please leave. - Yeah, that's great idea. What if l do leave? What if l go straight to erkhoff's office, let him know what all you guys are planning? Smart ass! - l held a press conference. l'm pretty sure he knows. - You're stupid, Dwight. - Fuck it! That's it, you stupid-- - Hey! Whoa! - Seriously! - You seem fairly calm, Henry. - l am. - How? - What do you think is going to happen when they get outside? - What do you mean? - Well, what do you think about kids these days, Jeanne? re they bored or apathetic? - Well, l don't know. - Well, l think l do. nd l don't think it's what Leon expects. - David. Phone. - Ooh! Hello? Oh, hi, Laura. No, l just thought it was somebody else. No! My god! Why would you even think l'd think it was Leon? You're so-- w! - lexandra does this really annoying thing where she moves things with her feet. l think it's from being a ballerina as a child. cup of coffee is meant to be held with a hand. h! They're doing a little shuffling with the curriculum l hear. Some of the teachers are gonna be downsized... - Hmm! - O.., let's go! Let's move it. Let's clear the exit! School progress! Let's go! Let's go! This way. This way. - Leon! Leon! Stop for a second. - No! Mustn't cease the momentum. - Leon! Stop! Stop! - What? - Stop! Hey, hold up! Hold up! - What is this, recess? This is supposed to be a fucking revolution! - l know American Idol totally used to be about talent. Now, it's all about who has the best voice. lt's bull shit. - Man, what the fuck are you saying? l do too shave my pubes! - No, no, dude. Listen to me. l need herbal Oxy cotton! l'm allergic to chemicals. - Well, O... We'll keep texting about it, but l don't feel like talking. Thank you. - xcuse me. - l'm gonna do a new one. Bottled up slipstreams And old broken moonbeams They won't see us through till the dawn - - Shh! And you call in the lights in the royal blue night And you ask me to tell you what's wrong Well crowned kings some days Run 6 ways from Sundays You got your Sunday vest on And you'll fix it You'll find it This time you'll mind it But baby I'm already gone... - It's all over. l'm not it. l'm not the man for the job. oth my heart and my cause lie broken and bleeding on a basketball diamond in Montreal West. - ln nglish, please. - Don't talk to me like that! - Don't talk to me like that! l don't want the press release. - Oh, right, right. Uh, l forgot, this is all an act. l can't feel things. l don't feel anything, so l guess this doesn't bother me at all. - No. That's not what l meant. l'm sorry. - lexandra... l don't trust you anymore. - ... can't find it And baby we're already gone Fuck. And I'm black and I'm blue But I'm still made up of you And there's just no place left alone But I go face the grey Be better some day And baby I'm already gone Thank you. - What? - l think l'm in love. - You are? - pparently. - h! Hey, lex! All! a va? Mmm! Mmm! - Oui! You look beautiful. - Oh, thank you. You too. - l brought champagne to Thanksgiving. ls that weird? - There's never a bad time for champagne. - That's what l thought. - Uh, lex? Listen, um, you've got a bunch of ex-boyfriends or something in the kitchen. - Oh... O... - Just wanted to let you know. - Yes, thank you. - l'll take that. They take any more money out of History department, there won't be one left. That's not what l heard. l heard Russian studies is gone. You find that funny? - No, it's perfect. lt's a perfect thing to, uh, give thanks for.. - Hey, you. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey! l thought l'd put this in the fridge. - Sure. - Hey, lex. You, uh, you look great. - Thanks, Julian. Hi! - Hi, lex. You look great. - How've you been? - l have to go to the washroom. - Don't worry, guys. lt's slightly more embarrassing for me than it is for you, so... bottom's up. - Hey! - We already did that. - O... Uh, l haven't heard from you in a few weeks. - l haven't heard from you in a few weeks either. - How you been? - Not great, but whatever. - O... We should, um, have coffee or something... - Oh, please stop. Please stop this. - O... l was just trying to-- - l know--l know what you're trying to do. Uh, l would rather not talk to you at all than talk like this. - O.., fine. - ll right. - Yeah. - Oh no, it's just that history is so important that-- - Oh shit, Julian, if you really feel that way, you ought to be doing something about it. Like Leon here. - Yes, good call, Francis. l'll be his shining example of utter ineffectiveness. - lt was not ineffective! Reason it didn't work, is because you didn't teach the kids how to strike properly. You don't learn it through osmosis. You know what l mean? - You don't. - Listen, when l organized my first be-in against the war, a lot was expected of us at erkeley, baby. That was ground zero. - You went to erkeley? - erkeley in those days was ground zero. - Ooh! Can you spell "clich"? - Right in the middle of the ennedy administration, so the kids weren't used to those massive demonstrations. - You are so old! Wow, l didn't realize that... Old man! - Shut up, Julian! - You are an old-- You are a geez-- a geezer. - Okay, that's enough. l think it's time for bed... What do you say, Julian? - O.., O... l'm gonna go, guys. l'm gonna-- Gotta be up tomorrow. - Au revoir. - O... - l got the chair. - Please continue. - Huh? - Your erkeley-ennedy demonstrators. Please continue. - This was before Patty Hearst and the DNC in Chicago, lt was before all that stuff. very time l would try to pull a demonstration together, it was, uh, just a disaster. Unless we had some fascist on the campus that we could yell at, it would turn into some gigantic sock hop. l'll explain that to you later. l'll tell you what that means. ut the point is, everybody came just to be part of the scene, you know, just to-- just to be in the club. nd then, one day l realized, it's never real until it stops being fun. ll of these people, everyone one of them has to be as serious as you are about it. Not that it's realistic that anybody would ever be as serious as you are about anything. That was a little joke, Leon. "jokitations". Leon? - ll right. Here's the deal. We fucked that strike up. - lt wasn't that bad. - lt wasn't awesome. - Well, we're moving on. ut before we do, you all need to ask yourselves one question: How far are you willing to go? - ll the way. - Yeah. - Well, good. Faith without deeds is dead. The time has come for a coup. veryone follow? - Fuckin' ! - Remind me what a coup is again. - l can't go any further without saying this: We are changing territories here. We are going from the defensibly legal, to the indefensibly illegal. - Uh, what? - We could go to jail. For real. That being said, Skip and Sarah, l need you guys at the movie theatre on Friday. You need a solid alibi hiding in plain sight. Meanwhile, when you're in the theatre, start texting your friends. Get them to text their friends. Send out the word that there's something happening at school. - l don't know. Texting in the theatre? - That's just not cool. Why can't l really help? l'm already in so much trouble with dad. What's the worst that can happen now? - l heard the word "jail" again. Um, why don't l just take Sarah to the movies? - No. No, you will not. Skip will. This is the biggest favour you can do me right now. - Well, um, Sarah, l heard there's a new Zack fron movie coming up this weekend? - nd l think there's, um, there's a new en Loach retrospective at the Cinmathque. - ither way. - Who were those kids in the nimal Farm outfits at the dance? - Oh, l know one of them. Her name is Mlanie. - Uh, her name is actually Marie-Soleil. - Mmm. l've told you, l know every French person's name. - ring me those heads. So you're ready to go to the movies? - Oh my god! Stop yelling. Yes, let's go. O... Sorry. Yeah Come Go go go go go go go Let's go Fire Bundle up My whole style is so cold I glow like old guys who go bald My flow got no front in the vocal Your flow got no button its so old I don't mean to sound like a showboat But it's true my persona's no joke I stepped into some kind of portal I'm legend and sometimes I'm noble I'm from the most risky zone oh No place is more shifty global More pistols Russian revolvers We shootin' all that is normal But it ain't just because we want to We ain't got nowhere we can run to Somebody please press the undo They only teach us the things that guns do They don't teach us the ABCs We play on the hard concrete All we got is life on the streets They don't teach us the ABCs We play on the hard concrete All we got is life on the streets They don't teach us the ABCs We play on the hard concrete All we got is life on the streets - See me go over the counter? - Hello?

They don't teach us the ABCs We play on the hard concrete All we got is life on the streets They don't teach us the ABCs We play on the hard concrete All we got is life on the streets Come... - O.., we're good. - Mr. ronstein, l know it's you in that pig mask. - lt's time for you guys to get the hell out of here. - What do you mean? - Well, there's nobody left. We've secured the office. There's no other reason for you to stick around - You have any idea how long it took me to figure out how to barricade these doors? - You sure you don't need us? - No, l'm positive. No, what l need you guys to do is go find Skip and Sarah and spread the word, O..? l need a really big crowd out front and quick. We really need that crowd. - Understood, comrade. - Yeah, man. - Spasibo. ll, police? xcuse me, but l've forgotten how to say "hostage negotiation" in French. Ah, d'accord. Merci beaucoup. l actually just got off the phone with the cops just this second. They're on their way down now. l told them that l wasn't armed technically, but that l could still do lots of damage. - Stop talking to the cops! - l thought it was cool. - Don't say anything else till I get there. - l'm re-enlisting. Do l have a cell phone? - ey, uh, it's Leon. Um, I'e taken my principal hostage so I'll probably be on the news soon. So, if you miss me at all you can see me there. And I still love you. That's it. Goodbye. - ey, uh, it's Leon. Um, I'e taken my principal hostage so I'll probably be on the news soon. No cops yet. l guess people don't actually care what happens to you. - What exactly do you hope to accomplish today, Mr. ronstein? ecause the almost certain outcome of this is you going to prison. - Yeah, l think that was pretty obvious by now. - Why are you deliberately sabotaging your own life? - Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me. l am not sabotaging my own life. How dare you? nd if l was, it would be for the sake of my ideals. - Oh, please! Your ideals? You want to better the existence of your fellow man? - Yes! Yes! That's exactly it! - Let me tell you what l learned after teaching public school. They don't want your help. They don't want it better. They want the same shit. lf they didn't, this wouldn't be hard for you. - You wanna know what's hard? What's hard for people like me is the very existence of people like you! - You make me sad, Mr. ronstein. revolutionary sans a revolution. You're a real Russian tragedy. - No, you are. You--you are that doctor in Uncle Vanya. lneffectual and middle aged. My troops will mobilize, just you wait. They will shed the thick cloak of boredom that you have forced them into. They will don their coats of arms and the--the tunic of oppression that you wear will choke you, sir. - You couldn't have mixed that metaphor anymore. - l make my point! - ronstein... ronstein... lsn't that the kid from the factory this summer? Yeah, the hunger strike kid. nd now, he's taken his principal hostage. Serious shit disturber. l thought he was fucked up, but... He's significantly more fucked up than l thought. - h! - Hmm. - Yes. Pigs is here. - Crowds yet? ny wild gangs of rebellious youth? No? What a shame. Maybe they don't hate me as much as you think they do. Hmm? - Look. We have to mobilize, guys. O.., it's crucial that we physically support this cause. - Yawn. m l right? - Shut up. - ut why? We already physically walked out of school. - Yeah. - That kid kind of scares me. - What the fuck is he doing anyway, holding erkhoff hostage? Shit, that's serious! - Yeah. Why not Davis? - What'll Leon do after this revolution? He'll redistribute homework so we all have equal amounts? - Can we have a student secret-police force? - l wanna be the young Putin! Right? - Ha, ha, ha. O.., look. You guys are gonna have to take this a little more seriously. - What the fuck is there to take seriously about this? l mean, ha, ha and everything, but where's the potatoes? - Sorry, what the fuck? - What's the substance to Leon's argument? - Yeah, l completely agree. - O.., look, l'm not like his spokesperson or whatever... - Oh, thank God for that! - Um... The schools suck. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Yes. - Obviously. - No, l mean, seriously, the schools suck. - Duh! - Yes. - Right, right. Um, should it suck? l mean, seriously, guys, should school suck? - No. - No. No, right? - So, if we all agree that school sucks and that it shouldn't, then what's next, guys? Hmm? - This is turning out to be a great speech. - That's where Leon's coming from. 'Cause he's the one-- He thinks... that what's next is us getting involved. ecause are we? re we involved? l'm not. Fuck no! l mean, l'm the fucking treasurer of the Student Union. l got you that job, man. - SHUT UP! - So fine, right? Whatever. There's no judgement. but l mean, for real, we don't do shit to make that school better. So Leon thinks that by forming this union, that it'll force us to kind of all get involved and we will make things better. O.., he thinks that things have a better chance of improving if we improve them ourselves. - l mean, that's dead fucking on. - Yeah. - xactly! xactly! That's the best possible explanation! - Wait though. Tony, do you-- do you think Leon's right? - Of course, he is. - No. - O.., Dwight, l wanna know what Tony thinks. - l don't know. l have no fucking idea. ut, um, you know who doesn't believe in this union? You know who thinks, like, our opinions mean less than nothing? Fucking erkhoff. You know, l'll figure out what l believe later. 'cause right now, all l want is for that asshole to be wrong. nd that's the only reason l need to follow Leon. l'll put my deeds before my faith for the time being. - l don't even think-- - Shut the fuck up, Dwight! urn. - Hey! That was fucking awesome! - Yeah, l guess we'll see. - No, seriously, Tony, it was. - Yeah, still gay. - Fuck! l'm sorry. l'm just super caught up in this shit right now, you know? - Glad you liked Land and Freedom. - Totally. lt's like my new favourite movie. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Hey! Skip! Sarah! - What happened? Why aren't you guys with Leon? - He wanted us to leave. We've been rabble-rousing, trying to spread the word. How's the crowd coming? my thumbs hurt. l'll tell you more on the way. Let's go. - They need your demands. These cops are getting bored. They're gonna bust in there and arrest you. O... O.., l'll tell the chief. O.., this is what he wants. He wants the school board commissioner to allow the kids to unionize. nd safe passage to Venezuela. That was a joke, the Venezuela. He wants the commissioner brought down here. That's all. - Fine. l want you to know that we're humouring him. - Humouring me? Could we please just get rchambault down here as quick as possible so we can all go home? Thank you. wesome. - h-ha! - This isn't over! - Oh, l think we both know that it pretty much is. - Mom! What are you doing? - Get in the car, kids. - No, Ma. We're going to the school for Leon. nd no, not even just for Leon. This is something that we all believe in. l won't come home with you! l'm sorry if l let you down. - Stop being so shrieky! l'll drive you. - You will? - Yeah, come on! Come in! Hurry! - Oh, great. l don't-- Do you guys want a ride? - Can you all fit in? re you O..? Put your seatbelts on. Your father wanted to come too, but he had a meeting with the Moroccans. - What's that? Put the seatbelt on. - Mum! Drive the car. - Oh, come on! - Madame, uh-- - Madam Chairman... - Madame... - Ma'am l should really explain the circumstances... - l watch the news l know exactly what's going on here. ut thank you very much. Leon ronstein Please come to the window. Give me a hand. - Uh, welcome. - l am thoroughly unimpressed and unamused, Monsieur ronstein. Now, perhaps this is your idea of playful hi jinks, but in my books and in the books of the gentlemen in uniform here, this is an egregious and punishable offence. - Well, maybe now you'll see that we're actually serious. - Who is the "we", Monsieur ronstein? You and God? re you the king of ngland? ll l see is one brilliant young man, desperate for attention, and clearly willing to go all the way to get it. - O... We want a union! - Listen, Norma Rae, we've already had that discussion, and it's not gonna happen. So let your principal go. - We want a union. - You don't deserve a union! You're children. You do what we'll tell you to do. nd on behalf of all adults, grow up, Monsieur ronstein. - Madame rchambault! Do you want him to be an adult or not? - Did l not just make myself clear? - No, you didn't. lt seems like a very adult thing to do, fighting for your rights. - Well, no one asked for your opinion. - l agree with her. - There's a surprise. Run out of clients, Frank? Had to start scouting the high schools? nd this is the best you could find? Leon ronstein, the shining beacon of hope for the great revolution? - l think he may well be, yeah. - How profoundly disappointing. - Good god, Denise, you're so mean! - Why don't you tell your crazy little friend to let us all go home? O..? - Let me ask you one real question first. - Shoot. - What kind of people you think it takes to change the world? l know it's all very amusing for those of us in the post-postmodern here, this notion of revolution. ut what kind of people do you think it takes to really pull this thing off? Do you think they ever change? No! They're always the wrong men for the job. They're always the ones other people think are crazy. - Do l really have to listen to this? - Do l think Leon ronstein is the right man for the job? You bet your ass, Denise, because he's doing it and you're not. - ravo. - Can l park here? - Yeah, you can park here. - O... - Uh, what's that? - What's what? - Holy fuck! - y the way, Denise, that shining beacon of hope found me. nd l'm damn grateful he did. - We want a union! We want a union! - We heard you, Monsieur ronstein. - Guess this is the "we" you were talking about, Denise. - We want a union! We want a union! - We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! We want a union! - l'm his lawyer l go where he goes. oredom! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! Union! - Well, of course we're gonna appeal, but we're very happy the way things turned out. - Yeah, uh, this is a message to the youth of Canada-- uh, nay, to the youth of the world, that they may be able to wound us, but we will never be silenced. We will always be heard! The revolution lives on! Vive la revolution! - All charges against Leon Bronstein have been dropped. The court released him on one condition: he is never allowed to attend school in the province of Qubec, ever again. - Well, if you need anything, money or food, just call me. l'll send you whatever you need. - Thank you. - O... nd don't worry about Ontario. You know, they're not only lice Munro and Maple Leaf fans. There are fun people there too. nd your father wanted to be here, but he couldn't because he had a meeting with, you know, those rabic people and-- - lt's O.., Mom. - l love you. - l love you too. l'm so proud of you. You are amazing. - Oh, stop it. Have fun. nd let me know what you plot. - l will. nd give my regards to Skip. - Who's Skip? That guy l saw you with? - Thanks, Leon. - ls he Jewish? - Ma! - Well, you know... - l know. We're gonna honeymoon soon. l'm keeping my fingers crossed for the Nunavut. - Hey, you're lucky. You only have to get banished someplace arctic once. l have to do it all over again with my second wife. - Oh my god! What have l done? Call me every day. - l will. - Drive safely! - l shall return. - Hello. - Hey. Uh... Yeah, so... l, uh... Yeah. - Chairman Mao's Little Red ook. - Yeah, it's in Chinese. So hopefully, you won't understand it. - Thank you, Dad. - Nadia! - Nadia! Give me a second, please.

Mr. Vladimir Ulianov? - Only to my grandmother, pal. Fuck! ls this about that library book? 'Cause l brought it back, man. l swear to God. Maybe they can't find it there, but l returned it. l don't give a shit about the history of the printing press, l swear to God. - l don't either. l don't know anyone who does. Listen, listen, Vladimir. My name is Leon ronstein. We have to talk. - What, now? Oh no, dude. No, no, no. Oh, my girlfriend just dumped me. l'm drunk. This is not a good time for me. - Listen, none of that matters anymore. Please, allow me to buy you a cup of coffee. Please. May l put my arm on you? You and l are going to change the world. - Cool, uh, stop touching me. Make up your mind And don't waste your time You've been so unkind You know all of the words Feels good to Hold on Take time off and get things done Get out Meet new friends Tell your girl she's the one Get out get out Well, there's nothing cool about it If there ever was I doubt it You should find pleasure abounding From the only place I found it Take time off and get things done Get out Meet new friends Tell your girl that she's the one Get out get out We can see the future lately I've been lost without you baby Even when I'm talking to someone I am alone I am alone Make up your mind And don't waste your time You've been so unkind Ooh Je ris pour toi
