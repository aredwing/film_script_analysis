[Moans, Sighs] To us. Of course. You know, Pippa... it's so crazy... how you can meet somebody for the first time... and feel more connected to them... than the people you've supposedly known your whole life. I feelin'like you're this beautiful mango. Ripe. Waiting for someone to pick you. Whoa. [Laughs] Central, you on patrol? Yeah, looks like we got a burglary on Cayman. - [Man] Securityl Hello? Oil - Shit. You bastardsl On your feet, Fritzyl I thought this was your friend's boat. [Man] Quite a nice Bimmer. Was it yours? [Dispatcher On Radio] All unitsl All unitsl Jesus. Hey, what's all this? Oh, hey, bro. There was a shootout. Yeah, man. It's the end of an era. [Man Narrating] In 1973, there was only one inmate... in the Cayman Islands Prison. Since that time, there has been an average of one murder per year. The majority of these incidents have fallen under three categories- vehicular homicide... domestic... or drug-related- all the incidents except one. On the quiet side of the island, a group of fishermen engaged in a heated debate. The homicide was witnessed by the fisherman's seven-year-old son... who for nearly five years did not say a word to anyone. This earned him the nickname Shy. [Man] What's up, Shy? Me and the boss takin' the boat out tonight for some deep-sea fishing. - You won't be needing me later then? - No, no, no, man. But I have two bookings in the morning. - I want you up and at 'em. - This one here. We got this last week. You guys are gonna love it. It's brand-new. - Cheers, Marvin. - Take it easy, bro. Good evening, sir. - Marvin. - How's it going, sir? How are you? This kid here- - He work for me? - Since high school. Daughters and the wives love him. You should see when he's working. The tip jar is full. I'm not running some kind of match service here, man. Gentlemen. [Door Closes] [Laughs, Sighs] You're home early. You can come to church with me tomorrow. Oh, Mom, I'd love to, you know, but I've gotta go to work. You know why I go to church? To thank God for my good son. Well, maybe you can tell that to the boss then. Or his daughter. Oh, yeah. I've been hearing things. Mom, church ladies aren't supposed to be gossiping. I'm her teacher. Schoolgirls do. Now, you be careful. You know me, Mom. I'm always careful. [Chattering] Two carrot juice and two fish soup, please. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. You're welcome very much. [Chattering Continues] Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. - Fly Guy, Shy and Kimo. - What's happening? Snort in faith, dog. Yo, Kimo, what's the deal with this switching chips thing? It seems kind of shady. You mean you been here all these years and not figured that shit out yet? Look, the barter system. The sour cream and onions is the weed... and the nacho chips, that's the cash. - It's a flawless system. - Very creative. Who you talkin' about? But, yo, on a real note, check this. Motherfucker! What'd you do? Rob the marine supply store? No, dog, I went on the Internet. Twelve-gauge is just like a flare, man. All I gotta do is file it down a little bit. Crazy fucker. Hey, go shoot Shy with that. Oh, blood, you need to chill out on him. Where my 10 dollars is? - Ten dollars for what? - For what? I went and got you weed. And I'm hungry. Here's your 10 dollars. - Thanks. - Now get the fuck out of here. You the handle. - You the blade. - All right. Later. ##[Man Singing In Spanish] [Man Speaking Spanish] Is that Kimo, the magnificent West Indian? Yo. Yo, dog, I have to go to school tomorrow. I know, dog. But it's her birthday, man. It's her birthday. You know, ain't never known a brother so pussy-whipped without gettin' no pussy. You got a filthy mouth for such a little dog. My dog not little though. - Scrapper. - Scrapper what? Teeny little scrapper. Teeny-weeny scrapper. Teeny-weeny nothin'. I'm liftin' trunks, see? I'm liftin' trunks, see? [Radio Static] Her dad's on a fishing trip. He'll be back in the morning. But if I'm not back in two hours, come call me. All right? Toss a pebble at that window. Do you see it? Why don't she just come out in the bushes and make this easier? Kimo, this is the way it works with the nice girls. One day you'll get yours and you'll know. I do know she turned legal about an hour ago... and you better hurry before them niggers start lining up. Don't be turning on that ghetto stereo. Look, man, don't be dissing my pookie, see? You gotta take this bike and go. Are you nervous? We don't have to do this, you know. We've got our whole lives ahead of us. Shy, what do you want to do with your life? Besides marry you? Besides marry me. Be serious. I was being serious. [Chuckles] I don't know. But I feel like I've got some time. I'm not in any particular hurry. See, that's what worries me. You're four years older than me. Three years, technically, birthday girl. Your life has no direction. All your friends are in high school. I bet Kimo's outside right now. - [Laughs] - Somebody's got to keep watch. I'm just worried that you're gonna be one of those island boys... that's just stuck on spring break. What are you saying? I'm nothing like those boys on spring break. I've never made a pass at you, Andrea. I love you. - No. Shy- - Let's just- I want this. I want to do this. I know you. [Rooster Crows] [Radio Static] [Horn Tooting] [Horn Tooting] [Sighs] [Rooster Crows] - Oh, shit. - What? [Sighs] What? Do I look like a monster? No, baby. You're beautiful. But I gotta go. - [Groans] - Kimo messed up again. Don't go. [Sighs] I've got to. Your dad'll be home. [Groans, Sighs] [Toilet Flushes] [Door Closes] - Drea? - Just pretend like you're sleeping. - [Knocking] - Oh, shit. Come on now. Open the door. - [Knocking Continues] - Please. Quiet down, man. Your mom's sleeping. Shit. There's somebody in there. - Is there a man in there? - Uh. Hammer! A man inside her room? Boy, go out and catch him! Run around front! [Grunting] Open the door for Daddy now. Sweetie, whatever's going on, you can talk to me. I have some people you can talk to. Don't worry. [Panting] [Chattering] How you been? Can I have some of this? I'll come back, Mommy. - Yo, what's up, man? - I can't believe you didn't wake me up. What am I? Your pussy watchman? I need my eight hours. I must say though, dog, you got skills. I need to try your cologne or something. I'm serious. I just hope she doesn't get in too much trouble, man. Her? You need to worry about if the Hammer gonna chop you to pieces. He's a rich boy. The worst he can do is get his dad to fire me. You know how he got that name? - 'Cause he hammers people to pieces? - No, man. Andrea hit him in the head with a hammer when he was a kid. - He's got a little dent right there. - [Laughing] - He had you runnin' though. - Only 'cause your ass didn't wake me up. [Horn Honks] - That your ride? - Yeah. - Which reminds me. - Hmm? - You owe me a bicycle now, dog. - Come on, man. Yo, we're all dogs, man. But, yo, some of us just pedigree. - [Horn Honks] - Kimo! How you doin'? Hey, I'll see you at school. Whitey boy. Why-Why doesn't he like me? Well, you're just not from around here. That's all. That's cool. [Chattering] Ah, my boy. What's happenin'? - It's a day of work. - The boss not here. Boss not here? Where is he? - Hey, yo, Antoine. - Yeah, yo. Someone last night raped his daughter. Raped her? Raped her? Yo, I've got to go. Bro gone mad. When acid is added to the universal indicator, what color does it turn? [Together] Red. We can then neutralize the acid by adding small amounts of alkali drop by drop. - And what color does it get to? - [Together] Green. - Now, make sure that those test tubes- - Psst. Yo, Keisha. Girl, what's up with you and this tub o'lovin'? Girl, you know I got a sickness for the thickness. - Kimo. - Shy, what are you doin'here? - I'm looking for Andrea. Have you seen her? - No, man. Oh, you come to get some more, huh? A little quickie in the washroom. You've gotta stop saying that shit, man. You're gonna get me in trouble. Yo, Shy, you were at my house this morning. That was you, motherfucker. I saw you. You come to my house, and you rape my sister. - No, no, no. I didn't rape your sister, man. - I saw you there. You lie to me about raping my fucking sister? - You fuck with my father's name. - I didn't rape your sister. - You fuck with my family name, huh? - [All Shouting] - Fight!

Darling, you don't understand what love is. You don't know man-woman love. I will talk to the police. I will handle all the legal concerns. - But why? - Because this boy, he come in through a window- - I let him in. - You never let no one in your house! Eh? You let him in for what? To steal the first night of your womanhood? Am I to put bars on the window? - Shy. - I'm sorry, Mom. What happened here? Why were you here today? I'm serious, kid. It's gangster, bro. This is- This is beyond- Once you do this, then there no coming back. It was just some mix-up. One of the gangster kids- You've gotta leave this school yard stuff behind. - I know. - You know how I feel about fighting. Don't touch this shit. I don't even want this on me, bro. I don't pick fights. Look at this face. It takes after you. - Come on. - Stop it. - Hey, you the handle. - You the blade, man. [Rooster Crowing] Hey, yo, for real, though, what happened with you and Hammer? I mean he can't let this shit go? Move. Yeah, that shit goes way back. He came and worked with us one summer down at the dock, trying to impress his father. My future brother-in-law, man. He's got a whole lot of proving to do to the world, yo. Yeah, but he gotta be jealous too, though, man. I mean the brother not blessed with good looks. - I prettier than him. In fact, he ugly, dog. - You're such a pretty boy. [Laughs] Ah, move, move.

[Andrea] You're safe. Tell me a secret, something you've never told anybody else. Never told anyone before... I fantasize about making love to you. - [Giggling] What? - No! That is not fair. I love you. Oh, I, uh... filled out my applications for university yesterday. I'm thinking law or business... something that makes lots of money. Stupid people make money these days, Patrick. Clever ones just help them look after it. Times have changed. What do you mean? What do I mean? I have a client in Miami- high school educated. One day some friends, and friends of friends, come along and say to him... "Would you mind very much looking after some money for me?" Paid cash for his trouble. And, uh, then, of course, he needs someone... to help him introduce the cash into the banking system here- invest it, hide it. Eh? So that's it. We all get little droppings. Putting a clean face on dirty money. Dad, do you- do you not like what you do? I'm looking for the prospectus for the condo property. Uh, I must have left it back in the office, sir. Yeah, I bring you to Miami for two fucking hours. You bring a roller case full of fuck-knows-what and forget the most important- Allen. Welcome to Florida. - Good to see you. - You guys have a good trip in? - A few hiccups. This is my assistant, Sheila. - Yes, we've met. - Oh, really? - [Sheila] Cayman, briefly. I think it was at church. Right? That's right. That's right. A- At church. - That's right. I forgot. - You went to church? Yeah, on my last trip I decided to go and take in some of the local experience. - It's good seeing you again. - You too. That's quite a bag you got there. You guys moving to Miami, or am I about to sign my life away? [All Laughing] My sincerest apologies, Mr. Ridley... but there's some stuff I need to fax you later. Carl. Please. And, uh, use my home fax. Easiest thing in the world. - Uh, we, uh- - That's okay. - Is this your first time to the States? - Yes, sir. - Check the office voice mail. Should we talk? - You bet. Hey, I'll look forward to getting those papers. Allen, look, I've been really thinking this over, and... I think this is the end of it- I'm out. I feel it's just time to take the high road. W-We can deal differently, you know. - We can go into hedge funds, bonds- - No, no, that's not my style. - What are you gonna do with all the money under the mattress? - What about the condo? I invest 1.5, I don't even- Mr. Ridley's a very nice man. Fancy him? No, sir. I saw you. [Sighs] Lingering handshakes. Well, he's very powerful. - Allen, we discussed this. - He's very rich. [Allen] The more you earn, the less you keep. In that case, I should've just brought in cash. I could've gotten it for a million even. You want to walk into a Realtor with a million dollars in cash? Didn't do a fucking thing. Say, you'd make a good team, wouldn't you? ##[Man Singing] ##[Continues] ##[Continues, Fades] [Line Rings] Yes, this is Mr. Allen from the Cayman Islands. [Allen] Special Agent Martinez. Enforcement. Hi! How's it going? Thanks for getting back to me so soon. No, I was just with him yesterday. Hold on. What was the number to Mr. Ridley's condo? C- 4. Sorry. [Mouths Word] Fax. No, they're on their way now. Uh, excuse me, sir? Are we allowed to fax bank statements? Just fucking do it, will you! Sorry. Go ahead. [Allen] Jesus, you guys work fast, don't you? [Phone Rings] Hello. Mr. Allen's office. Sheila? It's Carl. Can you talk? Oh, Carl. I'm so glad you called. No, no, me first. I feel like an ass. - Sheila? - That whole charade with your boss. - Sheila! - Hello? Coming, Mr. Allen! [Beeping] - [Whirring] - Dad! You got a fax! Take this down to the post room, get it packed up for shipping. [Gene] So why are you leaving? Do you know the thing about the Cayman Islands? You know about the tax thing. Enlighten me. Years ago... all bushes and fishermen. There was a storm. A convoy of ships was crashed on the reef... and the locals risked their lives to go out and help the passengers... one of whom turned out to be the son of King George III of England. And His Majesty was so pleased... that his son's life had been spared... that he decreed the Cayman Islands had paid their dues to the crown... and would never again have to pay taxes. Hundreds of years later... the locals took it upon themselves... to open up that privilege to the rest of the fucking world, made a fucking mint. - They fucking did, didn't they? - Yeah. That's why the roads are all paved and the streets are fucking clean. Because the locals know how to work the fucking system. That's what I want you to do- just help me work the fucking system. - How? - Well... you're a senior manager. That means you can sign off on my account... make deposits over time... on my behalf. And where are you gonna be? [Allen] I'll let you have the house as well. I'll be offshore. Or in prison. [Allen] I'll be rich. Rich white men don't go to prison. I'll drink to that. - You're a good man. - Cheers. [Allen] Do you want me to tell you what we're gonna do? - [Car Door Closes] - Bullshit, yo. I'm gonna take her inside. Why don't you take our boy down to see Powell. [Locks Rattling] Fuck, man. This way, miss. What the fuck kind of thing they dealin' with now? [Door Chime Dinging] [Engine Starts] So, according to this young lady... when she and the other gentleman got down to the dock... the glass on the boat was already smashed. - Who is this other gentleman? - Oh, I don't know. He got away, so we couldn't catch him. Likely some local. Mr. Allen, he's a lawyer. Right? [Phone Ringing] Allen. - Get the phone. - [Ringing Continues] - [Ringing Continues] - [Sighs] [Snoring] Hello? Allen! Wake up! - Wake up. It's the police. - Mmm. What? Ridley? Is he on the island? Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll be right there. [Sighs] [Beeping] [Ridley On Machine] Allen, where are you? - I left five messages. - He called several times during the day. Why didn't you fucking tell me? You're completely drunk. [Sighs] Remember when we first came here, we used to sit by the ocean? You liked the smell. When was the last time you smelled the ocean? Shut up. Turn the light off. [Door Alarm Dinging] Get out of the fucking car. Walk. [Lock Clicks] What goin' on, Officer Powell? What happenin'? You know, Fritz, I been on to you for some time. Borrowing of the cars, boats, condos. I mean, I expect it from the spring breakers, but you? You live your whole life on vacation. You know what I think it is? You're a fucking whitewashed, wanna-be American. You don't fit in amongst the locals... so you leech off of the next batch of fucked-up girls... that want a fling with a little island monkey. I'm talking to you. Look at me. Don't fit in? Officer Powell, my family been here six generations. Since tightropes and turtle nets. I think I can stick my dick in any piece of sexy white beef I feel is worthy- What you doing? - Where's your father? - Uh, I don't know. - You don't know? - Don't know where your father is? - Where are you living? Where are you staying? - [Chuckles] How do you not know where your father is? - We just got here. L-I don't know. - You don't know much, do you? Look at you, leeching off the rich, living other people's lives. The bloody boats. - Come on! - And the cars. - Fuck you! Fuck you! - And the condos. [Sighs] Allen. Jesus Christ, man. Am I glad to see you. - Where have you been? - I'm sorry, man. I called your office, your house. I must've left 10 messages. I had no idea. I've just been busy. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Pippa's gone. L- I don't even know where to begin to look. Pippa's at the police station. - The police station? - Yeah. - What happened? - She just got taken in for something. It's no big deal. She's fine. That's why I'm here. What are you doing on the island? They came at me hard- warrants, subpoenas. Barely got to the bank in time. - It's a good thing you sent that fax. - Yeah. Which fax? Oh, the one-Yeah, Sheila sent it first thing this morning. About the condo. Yeah, that is lucky. Fuck, they just- No warning? They just come down on you? That's too bad, man. I can't believe that. - I thought you had connections. - Yeah. Yeah, l- Y-You said that Pippa's okay? Yeah, she's fine. We should go and get her. Let me just grab a couple things. Fuck! Son of a fucking bitch! [Allen] Fuck, they just-No warning? They just come down on you? - Which fax? - Dad, you got a fax! Sheila sent it first thing this morning. About the condo. Special Agent Martinez. [Lock Clicks] Traveling light? Heavy enough. Let's go. Hey, Carl. You should put that somewhere safe, if that's what I think it is. Let's just get to the station. - I wanna see my daughter. - You're on the run from the feds. You wanna turn up at the police station with a bag of incriminating evidence? You are a fucking adultl - Act like it! - [Groans] [Gasping, Panting] [Groans, Panting Continues] Let me tell you something, Fritz. I'd better not see you even riding in a car if your name is not on the deed. Understand? [Fritz Groaning, Muttering] Not even to borrow your mum's piece of shit wagon to get groceries. Because if I find you in a car, I'm gonna beat you... - and throw you in the swamp! - [Groaning] We huntin' some imaginary people, bro. It's a nice crib though. - [Chuckling] - Sick fuck. Fuckin' empty! I'm gon' kill Fritz, man. I'm gon' kill him! Wherever I see him, I don't care- I'm gon' kill him! If I have to find the girl, they'll have to find your body! Why, dude- [Screams] - Where are my fuckin' glasses? - I don't know! Christ. [Dryer Buzzer Buzzes] ##[Dance] - [Gunshot] - [Screaming] Shy, you're gonna kill me now? What the fuck did I do to you? Huh? I lived to love your sister. What was so fuckin' wrong with that? Fuck you. - That wasn't love. - What the fuck do you know about love? Huh? Do you know what it means to love? Do you? Do you know what it means to look into someone's eyes, someone you love? Do you? She was so fucking innocent, man. She was so pure, and she loved me. You fuckin' embarrassed my family, Shy. My sister had everything before she started dealin' with you. - I just saw her being fucked in a toilet! - And who's fault is that? Huh? What does she got now? She's better off now, is she? She's fucking better off being fucked in a cubicle by some fucking stranger? I can't stand you, brethren. That's the way it is. This didn't scar me, man. You scarred her. Fucking live with that. You fucking live with that. You. - [Exhales] - Bloody been in here for 48 hours. [Beeping] I put it in first thing on Monday. Cash business as usual. It's too big. I got it. Only two people in the world know this combination- me and God. And he's too busy to remember. Don't worry. Come on. Let's go and find her. Put this jewelry somewhere now. [Exhales, Whispers] What the fuck? [Buzzer Buzzes] Is she all right? - Yeah, she's fine. - What are the charges? Drugs? - No, no. There are no charges. - Then what are they holding her for? Just because they've had a bit of a rough night. A shooting, a burglary. The shit's hit the fan tonight for some reason. Hi, Andrea. Have you seen him? Yeah, man. We saw him down by the dock just now. Dock by the dock. Without a doubt, yeah. So you come to the Cayman Islands, and you don't even call me? I should be horsewhipped. - Where's Allen? - He left with them. [Clears Throat] Courtesy of a grateful nation. For you and your family. - Thank you. - There'll be a lot of questions asked. Where the money went. Where it came from. Who betrayed whose client. Cayman police are gonna come looking for you. God bless America. Sweetheart? - Are you okay? - Daddy. - They treat you all right? - [Whimpers] Extradition time, Carl. Vacation's over. What? Carl? One minute. Hold up. I gotta go off with these guys for a while. - What happened? - I fucked up, baby. I fucked up. I wish I could say something that would make it all right, b-but I can't. - What? - You'll be okay. You'll see. It'll be okay. Baby, you're so beautiful. You'll be okay. It's okay. - Daddy- - Just look to your memories. It's all you'll ever need. - I love you so much. Do you know that? - Gotta go. - Please. Please! - Take him back. - Goddamn itl - No. No. It's gonna be all right. I want him in my car. Can't just come to these islands and exploit these people. They don't deserve it. [Carl] Baby- - Mr. Allen, why are you- - Thanks for coming down, Sheila. Keep the car. Come on, sweetie. I'll look out for you. I've been looking for you all night. I lost my way... and I'm sorry. Baby, I really needed you. It's just that... you're my heart. And when you broke... [Sobs] I broke down with you. I want to be with you, Shy. I don't care what my father thinks. I don't care what Hammer thinks. I care about you. You don't know. [Andrea] Know what? Fuck you, Shy. Huh? I'd rather my sister be a whore in the fucking streets than fuck with you! - [Gunshot] - [Groans] [Whimpering] Fuck it! I'm sorry. [Rapid Breathing] - Patrick? - [Martinez] You're on the clock. Yeah. Patrick! [Martinez] Hey. Listen to me. That piece of ass you call a secretary is at the station right now making herself a deal. So you have a choice- pack your shit and meet us here in five minutes... or your family's gonna be visiting you in prison. It's all right. I'm traveling light. Yeah. Twenty-eight pounds. - What? Pardon? - Don't you remember what you asked me, Allen? In Miami? You want to walk into a Realtor with a million dollars in cash? - Do you have any idea how much that would weigh? - A million dollars. One-hundred-dollar bills. Twenty-eight pounds. [Martinez] Chop chopl Where have you been? Don't do that to me again, okay? Talk to me. I've been so worried. You ready? Come on! We've got to go!
