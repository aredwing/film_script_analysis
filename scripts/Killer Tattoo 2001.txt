No matter right or wrong, will get it's return. In this life or the next life. If we have to wait until next life then we will suffer from nightmare in this life. Right? You did bad thing, you will suffer from your sin. If you don't want the suffering, you should give up revenge. We should learn to forgive. Forgive the others I think I cannot do this now. Nightmare come from your own heart. To stop nightmare, you should learn by heart rather than killing. OK, it's gone... What are you screaming for? Buffalo Gun! You nearly gave me a heart attack! Hey, the guy that hit you over the head today just left. What do you want to do about it? I don't care about that guy I want to know about Flower Island instead I don't like pills I don't like chemicals. You are out of fashion I have my own thing. What? Too many mosquito up here.

Just tell me. My life is full of sad stories. Before, they called him. Oh M16 pretty boy, was as crazy as he was cruel. Killed kids or pregnant women if the job required it. Despite his cruelty, he had a sense of eloquence. He could sing every Elvis song. Then, one day, boom, boom, boom! Who fell into the water? Water my ass! It was the sound of bombs exploding I see. That day, explosives went off in the restaurant. Oh M16 had to be hospitalized for a month. He woke up and couldn't remember who he was. Thought he was Elvis. Forgot all his Thai. Anybody who wanted to hire him had to speak to him in English. Or he care nobody not speak in English. People had to change his name. From Oh to Er. Er M16. You are a Dam Good friend to him. Even though he is crazy, you don't throw him away. To be honest. If I didn't place the bombs in the first place, I wouldn't give a shit about him I have to carry this dictionary every fucking day. It's fucking heavy. What was that? What's wrong with you? Did you hear that? I heard nothing. How are you, Ghost! Van, go and be reincarnated. Please don't haunt me.
