I have a car that's newer,|but it's in the shop. - Are you comfortable?|- Yes. I'll turn the radio on if you like. I'd rather not. - Where are we going?|- To your place. This is number 42. You're in|apartment F on the first floor. Here are the keys|to the apartment. - And this is where your new job is.|- What kind of job is it? You're an accountant|at a contractor's down town. A good firm. - Is that a problem?|- No. You'll get used to it. - May I help you?|- I'm supposed to start working here. - Ravnsfjell, is that right?|- Ramsfjell. With an M. - Hvard.|- Andreas. - Welcome.|- Thanks. - Want a gum?|- No thanks. - Suppose you want to see your office.|- I should probably meet the boss. - That's me.|- Say hello to Andreas. - Hello. Harald.|- Andreas. Andreas, this is Vigdis.|He'll be working in accounting. - Excellent. That's Ivar.|- Hello. Well...|Here we are. - Nice office.|- Yeah. A little cash.|Until you get a bank account. There's something wrong with|the booze in this place. They've watered it|or put something in it. Nothing wrong with the booze. I've been drinking all night,|but it doesn't work. Doesn't work.|My head's still clear. It's terrible. Don't listen to him. He's drunk. I've spent everything I've earned|on booze, but still nothing. There's no point. And philosophical.|Drunk and philosophical. I've tried everything.|Nothing tastes any good. I used to like hot chocolate.|But it's not any good now. - Nothing tastes anything.|- Don't listen to him. And hot chocolate's supposed to be|nice. Dark and tasty. - Just imagine the smell.|- You'll get used to it. It's not just hot chocolate.|That was just an example. It doesn't taste any good.|And it's all like that. Hot chocolate, pussy and burgers. - Nothing has any taste.|- What's your point? It's not that it need to be nice|all the time. But once in a while... Ouch! Ouch... Andreas, what happened? You can't just sit here. Don't touch me. Harald? Come here for a second. Andreas, what's happened? Don't touch me. I'm OK. Sorry about this. Stupid of me. Thanks for the ride. Hello. - Hello.|- Hello, Andreas. - Do you want some?|- Thanks. Hello. Want some cake? - I'm sorry.|- Anything we can do for you? - No...|- It's important that you're happy. Just let me know if you need a new|computer or a chair or whatever. - Everything's fine.|- You're not too busy? No. It's fairly simple.|Not too much. Just let me know. Don't worry about lunch.|Take whatever breaks you need. - Can I sit here?|- Please do. - There's plenty to choose from.|- That one. I like that one. - It's got to be comfortable as well.|- Right. Must be nice to sit on. - All of them are nice.|- Not all of them. A lot of them are nice.|That one's cool. - But it takes up a lot of space.|- Can't put it in a corner. - Can't put that one in a corner.|- What about that one? - It looks comfy, and...|- Not a bit too casual? - I don't want to be a snob, but...|- Casual style. Good idea. Then we could get|a more minimalist chair with it. I think you're right.|Difficult to choose. - Any plans tonight?|- No, I'm free. We're getting together for dinner|at my place. You're welcome to join us. - Something wrong?|- No. - How's that new girl doing?|- Better than we thought. Excellent. - What do you do?|- I sell kitchen interiors. Interesting. And what do you do|in the evenings? I'm taking a class.|I'm interested in interior design. Interesting. Maybe we could go out some time?|To a concert or something? That would be nice. Good. Cheers. Nice to se you all. Here we are. - Nice area.|- The house is a bit run down. I'm redecorating.|A bit much for just one person. Good night.|Thanks for walking me home. My pleasure. Good night. Unless you want to come in... Good job. - Is that colour azure?|- No, it's coral. Cool coral. They're beautiful. - I was sure it was azure.|- It could be. I think the manufacturers name|their own colours. - Really?|- That's my impression. One manufacturer's cool coral is|another manufacturer's azure. The bathroom is important. Some say the|kitchen is the most important, - - but I think it's the bathroom. What do you think? The bathroom is important. - Andreas?|- Yes! I don't like the white colour|in the living room. - Couldn't you sleep?|- No, I woke up. I had the strangest dream. You were in it,|and the man at the corner shop. The priming takes time.|Of course you're a bit tired. And a huge moose.|It came running down the street... I don't want you to talk like that. - I don't like it.|- I'm explaining why I couldn't sleep. I don't know what you're doing,|but please stop it. There's still quite a lot left to do. - Andreas?|- Yes? Could we put a bathtub|in the bedroom? - A bathtub?|- We could knock this wall down. That could be nice. I saw some nice rattan furniture|in a magazine. Don't you think|rattan would be nice? Yes... You haven't seen any teabags,|have you? No. I'm a coffee man. - Want me to get some for you?|- No, there's no need. Ingeborg? Would you like to|go to the movies with me? It doesn't have to be the movies. We could do that. - This is Anne Britt.|- Hi, it's me. I'll be a bit late to night.|You'll have to eat alone. - I have to run some errands in town.|- OK. I'll see you later. Bye, then. I'll walk you to the door. - I had a nice time tonight.|- The film wasn't too good. - It wasn't that bad.|- It was nice anyway. Are you uncomfortable with|me living with someone else? No.|We haven't done anything wrong. And what if we did something? No.|It doesn't bother me. Unless it bothers you. I guess I should go to bed. - It's late.|- And we have work tomorrow. Can I see you again? Yes. That would be nice. We should probably|get back to work. I'll wait here a while. So no one sees us together. - Wouldn't it be nice not to hide?|- It would. Do you want anything?|Cake? Yes, please.|That would be nice. I've met someone else. - What do you mean?|- Another woman. Why? I fell in love with someone at work.|I didn't plan to. - I thought we were happy.|- We were. - But then I fell in love.|- Why? I'm going to leave you. We're having guests on Saturday. I haven't found an exact time,|but I wanted you to know. Are you leaving before Saturday? - I can stay until Saturday.|- That would be good. Ingeborg. Ingeborg? - Sorry.|- Andreas? What are you doing here? - Come down.|- What? Come down. - I was already in bed.|- Come with me. I have a surprise. - I can't go out dressed like this.|- You look terrific. This was a nice surprise. This isn't the surprise. I've left Anne Britt. I told her I was in love with|someone else. I had to. So now we can move in together. - Aren't you happy?|- Well, yes... We don't have to meet in secret. That's good. I hope you didn't leave Anne Britt|for me? Maybe I did it for me?|It didn't feel right. Not by Anne Britt or by you.|It felt wrong. Is something wrong?|I thought you would be happy. I didn't know|we had that kind of relationship. - A serious relationship.|- No... Is there someone else? - Who?|- Is that important? - It's Lars Birger down in reception.|- The fat one? He is just a little big. And then there's Tom. He lives in my building.|I don't see him that much. It's no big deal. - And then there's Jens.|- I'd rather not know. I can't criticize you. I was living|with someone else when we met. So I really can't say anything. - Are they important to you?|- Who? - Lars Birger and the others?|- No. But it's nice. Would you dump them for me? I could do that.|It's nothing serious. - Would you do that?|- Yes. But do you want to?|We could find a place in town. Would you like to see|the dessert menu? Do you want to move in with me? - We could do that.|- But what do you really want? Am I more important to you|than Lars Birger and the others? You're very nice. - And the others?|- They're very nice too. But who do you prefer? I think everyone's nice. But it would be nice|to have a bigger place. Three rooms,|and maybe a bathtub. At my place there's only a shower. Hello? Hello? Nordby called and invited us|to the go cart track on Saturday. - Go cart?|- On Saturday. Do you want to? Yes, sounds nice. We met in the men's room. You complained|that nothing tasted anything. Nothing tasted any good. You were quite loud. Sorry. You went on and on.|You talked about hot chocolate. Sorry about that.|I've calmed down now. - Let me in.|- Could you please leave? - Let me in.|- Do I have to? Yes. I don't want to make any trouble. Could you please leave now? You can't tell anyone about this. I found it a couple of months ago. - Where does it come from?|- From that hole. - There's a small light.|- Don't touch anything. It could collapse. - You can't tell anyone.|- Of course not. Everything fine? You seem a bit uncomfortable. Too much work? I miss so many things, Hvard. The new lamps have arrived. I miss seeing children. And hot chocolate. Nice and hot. I was just thinking about children. Do you remember|what a baby looks like? I have to work late tonight. - Lf that's OK with you.|- Of course. I'm not sure how late I'll be.|Don't wait up. OK. You can't do this.|We'll get caught. We'll get caught! You can't be here. I think I smell something. - There's something there.|- You have to go. This is mine. - You have no right to be here.|- What are you going to do about it? - Did you smell something?|- Yes. A nice smell? A nice smell. - That's enough.|- Right. The coffee? - This is better.|- Much better. Hello. Hello. I need to talk to you. - We had to make certain changes.|- Who's he? - He's not half as good as you.|- Am I fired? We don't to look at it like that.|Lots of people change careers. I know an architect who started|working in a cafe. He was happy. It's been nice working with you,|Andreas. - Good luck.|- Thank you. Come here. Hello! Hello? - What's the matter?|- There's a smell, and we hear things. It's nothing. There was a leak,|and I had to do some plastering. There's nothing going on here.|I don't know what you mean. - We want to join in.|- We have repaired the leak. - We want to join in.|- You can come later. I can smell something. It was just a string of coincidences.|I'm not involved in this. I suggested we leave it be,|but he wanted to expand. It wasn't my idea. I like it here.|There's no need to take me as well. You're free to go. Most people are happy here,|Andreas. They think it's a nice city.|They have everything they need. People are happy. The majority of people are happy.|And we're proud of that. Welcome.|The car is over there.
