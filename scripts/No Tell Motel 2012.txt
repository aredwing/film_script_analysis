( gunshot ) that's the second one. no, wait, wait. i grew up around here. there are stories about this place. the former owners-- they lost their daughter. and then they lost their minds. they died... in a most unattractive manner. what does this have to do with us? i think they still live here. whew. you can go first... if you want. corey? megan: i don't believe in ghosts. did you see anything weird tonight? you mean besides my best friend being hit in the middle of the road? that's how she died, you know. the little girl. a pickup came barreling down that same blind path. she was in the road. god knows why. tell me everything. corey? corey?

( rapid breathing ) spencer: kyle! matthew: the other three bodies wouldn't have been discovered till 1975. the other...three? yeah. but i'm getting ahead of myself. let's start with mary. she took angela's death brutal hard. a few days after the funeral, she went down to the basement, poured herself a nice, hot bath and slashed her wrists. she killed herself? tried to. grigor apparently saved her. how do you know? because... the real way she died... is so much worse. ( clatter ) grigor? here. please. eat. why are you doing this? you need your strength. please, grigor. she's gone. let me go, too. ( breathing heavily ) i won't lose you. ( sobbing ) you already lost me. ( screaming ) you can't keep me here forever! someone will find me! someone will help me! ( screaming ) there is no longer vacancy! if you truly cared for me... you wouldn't keep me suffering. you're right. then do it, grigor. please, please, please do it! do it! they say the root cellar was littered with vials. you couldn't take a step without breaking glass. how long did he keep her down there? long. ( thud ) ( sobbing ) matthew. matthew. did you see a little girl? he's in shock. oh, yeah? he killed rachel. where's corey? where's spencer? i'm seeing things. kyle? kyle? god damn it. you're one hell of a withdrawal symptom-- i'll give you that. ( panting ) truth be told, i've never been fond of hallucinations. especially creepy little girls. no offense. ( moaning ) good idea. this shit's weak. ( door creaks ) kyle? hey, man... i just ran out of booze, so my tolerance for this shit has officially hit sub-zero. i don't get it. it feels like it's working. but you're still here. you're being awfully nice to me, considering the circumstances. that's me-- awfully nice. did you take something from me? sorry. it was kyle. he's been really weird tonight. who's kyle? my boyfriend. oh. hey, there's something under here. i'll get it. no, it's okay. is this... he gave her so much. they could've kept this place open and nobody would've heard a thing. ( giggling ) grigor: ma-a-ary? mary... quite contrary. ( giggling ) ( gasping ) just how does your garden grow, hmm? with silver bells... ( giggles ) and... and cockle shells and pretty maids... all...in a row. ( panting ) ( grunts ) spencer! downstairs! what? oh, my god. what happened? you're alive? what happened downstairs? i found someone dead down there. what? in the cellar. what about corey? oh, shit. where is she? i don't know! we need to find her. i'm not going back down there! rachel's already-- i don't know if you've noticed, but there's some seriously fucked-up juju going on here. please, spencer, don't make me do this alone. god damn it! you're a real piece of work, you know that? hey. thank you. okay. this was your idea. corey? corey? corey? corey? corey? no, this can't be happening. i never knew that. you think you know someone. why didn't she ever tell me? jesus, meggie, i don't know. people keep secrets from each other, okay? now can we please just get the fuck out of here? what are you doing? i think i know who's doing this. who? megan? kyle? kyle? he said he saw her. we have to get in there. all right, all right. ( grunting ) kyle? oh, my god! what? oh, my god! oh, my god! get him up. kyle? ( grunting ) ( sobbing ) kyle? come on. kyle. kyle. oh, jesus. oh, man. come on, bud. wake up, kyle, please! ( sobbing ) come on, man. kyle? kyle! no! stop. he's gone. no. ( mutters ) god, spencer. i'm so sorry. i'm sorry. we need to get out of here. angela. no! oh! no! ( grunting ) kyle was an idiot. spencer. he was a decent enough brother, but i never respected him. he's dead. yeah, i know. and if i'm gonna die tonight, i'm gonna tell you how i feel. this isn't the time. it never is. do you have any idea how you used to shrink when you were around him? you're a strong a smart girl, meggie. and i just want you to know that i see that. thanks. um... there's something else i need to tell you. okay. you're not gonna like it. what? i've always had a crush on you. that's okay. no. because i acted on it. what do you mean? halloween. what about it? i did something bad. what'd you do? all my life, i've seen kyle get whatever he wants. what did you do, spencer? ( sighs ) i put something in your drink. something? it got you a little... you know. you're not telling me this. kyle was wasted, so i took you back to my house and i, uh-- i slept with you. i'm sorry, megan. i know it was wrong. but you did it anyway. i love you, megan. i've loved you for so long. no, you're sick. no! i have. get away from me! you know what? i'm glad you told me. really? yeah. you want to know why? because now i know whose baby i'm carrying. you're pregnant? yeah. i found out tonight. are you sure? i mean, maybe it's kyle's-- it's not. how do you know? did you use a condom when you raped me? megan, it wasn't rape. then what was it? you're my secret admirer-- why don't you tell me? just leave me alone. you think you can confess that sin and be done with it? look, back off! ( door creaks ) holy fuck. megan! i'm sorry. i've had it with secrets. okay, angela. show me the way. ( gasps ) ah, damn it! hello? uh, my-- my name is megan. yours is angela, right? i just want to talk, to find out what happened here. i know about your parents. um... they loved you very much. and when they lost you-- i can't imagine losing a child. i can't imagine having a child. i know you're hurt, and i know you're angry, but-- but why are you hurting other people? hurting other people doesn't fill the holes inside of us. it just creates more holes. maybe if--if someone knew your secrets... you wouldn't be so angry. you could be free from all of this. just tell me. i won't tell a soul. ( gasps ) ( screaming ) grigor. yes, my dear. it's happening. i will get my things. thank you. thank you for giving me a second chance. ( screaming ) no. i want to feel the pain. i understand. push. ( screaming ) push, mary! ( screaming ) push! push, mary! push! push, mary! it's coming! ( screaming ) push! i can see it! oh, god! ( gasping ) it's here, mary. ( baby crying ) it's okay. you're so strong. such a strong boy. please... let me see. such a strong boy. such a strong boy. my baby. my little girl. it is a boy. can we name him angela? hush. we are a family once more. we are a family. ( gasps ) ( baby crying ) ( grunting ) ( crying continues ) my baby! my baby! no! my baby! no! ( sobbing ) no! no! ( screaming ) aaaah! easy, easy. breathe, breathe. ( sobbing ) she killed him! i know. she couldn't reach for the baby, and they both died down there! oh, god! you shouldn't come down here. i had to know how the story ended. easy, megan. easy. it's not safe for someone in your condition to be this upset. my condition? what do you mean, my condition? rachel and spencer are the only people i told. told what? you were in the other room, weren't you, eavesdropping? you had a scare. no! no! no! let me go! ( gasps ) you can trust me. no. ( whimpering ) i really didn't want it to be this way. ( screaming ) i don't expect you to understand. ohh! i mean it! i don't want to fight! aah! i can't let you go! oh, god, you're hurting me! i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'd never do anything to hurt the baby. you're crazy. i am not. you're crazy! don't run! ( grunting ) you can come back down now, or i can come up. either way, it ends the same. how does it end, matthew? with a beginning. stay away from me! ( grunting ) ( gasping ) there's no reason we have to fall to their level. ohh! bitch! megan! megan! no! no! ( screaming ) ohh! this isn't over! do you hear me?! ( panting ) come on. ( engine won't start ) ( sobbing ) start! come on, god damn it! start! ( engine won't start ) oh, my god. ( gasps ) ( groans ) ( gasps ) you killed rachel on purpose. true. but, to be fair, the crash was a bit more convincing than i intended. ( sobbing ) when i came to, i saw your face. beautiful face. ( sobbing ) and i knew it was all worth it. why are you doing this?! because you haven't heard the rest of the horak story. i thought it was over. not anymore. ( groaning ) you see, mary did die down here. massive blood loss. but something interesting happened before she died. i'll let her show you. no, i don't want to see anymore! ( baby babbling ) seen enough? she saved the baby. she saved me. ( sobbing ) they found me in a parking lot, wrapped in a blanket. it didn't take me long before i realized i was adopted. i asked about my birth parents, but nobody would tell me. they all just had that same haunted look on their face. ( sobbing ) get off me! ( screaming ) easy. what are you doing?! no! no! don't--don't worry! i have no intention of treating you the way father did mother. what are you doing?! no! no! ( sobbing ) every time i drove by this place, it's like i could feel this pull, you know? like there was something special here. ( sobbing ) and there was. megan, meet angela. angela... meet your new mommy. don't worry. you'll be perfect. not like the others. you've done this before? you've got to separate the wheat from the chaff. ( sobbing ) and there's a lot of chaff, isn't there, angela? your friends, for instance. hit-and-run, attempted suicide, drugs, rape. you need to choose better company. please let me go! but you-- you're different. soft-spoken, intelligent, passionate. the perfect mother. but your real parents are here. please. they're too busy reliving the past to help us. angela and i are focused on building a future. no! no, don't! aaaah! you'll come to understand. ( screaming ) everything takes time. spencer: stop right there. antipsychotics? some heavy shit, mr. horak! you're a bit more resilient than you look. shut up and untie her. i can't do that. and why not? because fate tied those ropes. well, free will is gonna pull this trigger. spencer, look out! ( gunshot ) aah! no! ( clicking ) ( grunting ) spencer, please hurry! i'm gonna get you out of here. hurry. hurry! you okay? ( grunting ) get off of him! ( screaming ) ( screaming ) my baby. you killed my baby! oh, my god. sorry, angela. we'll make you a new brother. it's just gonna take a little longer. i had to. ( sobbing ) i'm sorry. i'm sorry. spencer? spencer? ( groans ) oh! ( gasping ) you need to stay calm. okay. can you untie me? come on, meggie. don't call me that. oh. we've had a long night, the both of us. just--just-- just untie me, and we can talk about it. i don't think so. what do you mean? where are you going? meg? come on. is this about halloween? i'm sorry! you just--you-- you can't leave me down here alone. oh, you're not alone. aah! aah! she just wants a little company. wait! are you gonna tell someone i'm down here? you gonna tell somebody to come get me, megan? actually, spencer... this'll be our little secret. no. no. megan, don't leave me! don't leave me, megan! megan! megan, megan, what are you-- don't leave me! megan, what are you-- no! come on! megan! no, don't leave me down here, please! megan, please don't leave me down here! megan! aah! uhh! megan!   yeah, hey yeah, yeah don't ask, don't tell i wish you well that is the last she said to me  oh, god, i know won't change, won't grow this is the last story come ahead come ahead she was the night, she was my life  all the while, the neighbors gossiping  can be forgot, won't be for naught  'cause now we're both unraveling  and i'm over the hill i'm over it don't stop, hold her when the nights get colder when the world turns over from the back to the front page  don't get higher, she's alone, she's tired  and in no way sober now she's back on the front page  yeah, yeah you know i know the way that goes we are exactly just the same  and you're not forgot won't be for naught the world will not forget your name  it's inside me, yeah and i'm over it don't stop, hold her, when the nights get colder  when the world turns over from the back to the front page  don't get higher, she's alone, she's tired  and in no way sober now she's back on the front page  yeah ( vocalizing ) oh, no oh, no back on the front page yeah back on the front page
