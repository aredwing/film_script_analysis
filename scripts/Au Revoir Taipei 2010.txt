Without you Taipei is very sad. Very very sad. Work with my father and my mother. Day after day, my life is same. I always think of you. Imagine us on the streets of Paris. You are my happiness. You are... Anyway, I'm still practicing everyday. Hope I have a chance to speak to you soon. So...call me back when you can. Okay, that's all for now. Bye-bye. The moonlight shines... On an open road... A breeze is blowing... I wait for him..., but he's not there. But my heart doesn't know... If he is coming. It sounds ridiculous But really... I haven't felt like this in a long time. This woman has brought love back into my life. Think about it. All this other stuff: Protection... Prostitution... Gambling... Running numbers, loan-sharking... It's all meaningless to me now. Brother Bao. I think you might be having... Some kind of mid-life crisis. You ever been to Hainan lsland? Never. What are you going to do there? Enjoy life with her. And grow old together. Oh, my South China Sea Girl. Don't be so brokenhearted! Fuck off. But Brother Bao... Your real estate company is making good money. Yeah, it's doing well. Everyone knows that. And it's clean. But this other score... If we take care of that... Then I'm set! Brother Bao... Are you sure about this? When you get to my age... You just want to be happy. Fuck off. I don't understand. I don't understand. Excuse me, sorry. This isn't a library you know. I'm just flipping through this. But you're here every night. Why don't you just buy it? I don't know. I guess I'm just bored. You must be really bored. Yeah. I'm not making fun ofyou. It's just that I see you in here a lot. Oh. Anyway, see you tomorrow. Oh, okay. Hello Faye. How are you? I haven't spoken to you in a while. If you get a chance Can you give me a call back? You're always in my heart. Good night, my little butterfly. About those four units... Right, four units, each 300 square meters. I had them appraised already. I start showing them next week. It's all taken care of. Very good. Uncle, I got a handle on the real estate stuff. But there are other things I'm capable of. Kai, take this to Brother Bao. Oh. Are you asleep? I'm fine. If there's anything I can help with... Brother Bao. Kai, you're around a lot these days. Oh yeah, just helping out. It's temporary. I see. Actually, we could use a smart college boy. It's okay, I've got plans already. Well, if you need anything.... Just let me know. Don't be shy. Sure. Thanks, Brother Bao.. Enjoying that? Uh-huh. -Good luck. -Thanks. -Come again. -Sure.

I'm getting ready to retire And I've decided to leave all this to you. No problem, Uncle. But this lottery store shit... It's beneath you. Cut it out. Understand? But Uncle, you know... It was a real sweet score! Everything here could be yours. That's not enough? It's just that... I want to see a little action. Action? Okay, I understand. Say no more. So we're clear? We're clear.

I can get you a schedule. That's okay. Really... Hey, so are you going to France or something? Yeah. Really? My girlfriend's over there. Oh. So you're studying French for your girlfriend? Oh. That sounds romantic. Really? Doesn't she think so? Yeah. Hello? Faye? Hi. How have you been? Oh. Oh. So, is everything okay? Oh Me? I'm doing okay. Nothing much. What is it? Oh. Why? What's wrong with you? We don't have the money for that. I'll pay you guys back. What are you thinking, kid? I don't know... I just need to get over there. Forget about it! Just forget about it.

How much do you need? Just enough to get to Paris. And maybe to stay out there for a while. Not a problem. It's just that... We had already made these plans. No need to explain.

I'm sorry I don't knowwhat's going on either. How did you get yourself involved in this? I don't know, I was just trying to get to Paris. That's all. You couldn't think of an easierway?

I don't want to be late. Nice moves back there. Pretty bad right? There's room for improvement. So what now? I don't know. Why you need to get over there so badly? Didn't you say that she's waiting for you? Yeah. I guess so. Actually, she doesn't even know I'm coming. You're kidding, right? We talked about going to Paris together. And then? I guess she decided l should just stay in Taipei. I thought that if I could get over there somehow. At least I would have that. I don'thave a whole lot going for me here. Draw! Flush! Red dragon, three seasons, mixed suits! Wiped you out! Fuck! We're not playing for money! I told you guys...I have mahjong skills. What are you wearing? Oh, I forgot to take it off. What a crappy job. Hello and welcome, please come again. Good impression. Shit yeah. I just got drafted though. Fuck. You got a girlfriend? Better hit that while you still can! For real. No. I don't have a girlfriend. But I'm working on it. Working on what? Yeah what? Nothing. Who's the girl? Co-worker. What's her name? Peach. Oh...Peach. Peach. So cute. Yeah. How much longer do you have? Not much longer. Does she know you're leaving? No. Fuck! When she hears that... Her bra will fly right off! Really? Just tell her... "Girl, I'm going off to the army..." "l want you to know..." "l won't stop thinking about you". That's how it's done. Definitely. You're in. No problem. Really? How do you think he ever gets laid? Actually, I've never even been in the army. Damn. Playing mahjong? Hey, Hong I want to play, who's winning? Who's this moron? We grabbed him. Where's the package? Oh. We had kind of a setback. But his friend has it. Right, so we were thinking... Who told you guys to think? Ifwe grabbed him... What is this? A picnic? I said get the package. But you bring back this moron! I can't believe you guys are my crew. Our bad, Hong. Yeah, sorry Hong. Sorry, Hong. It's okay, it's okay. We'll just have to adapt to the circumstances. We can still make this a successful score. Hey, Gao? Hey Kai, it's me, Gao. I know it's you! Are you okay? It's Gao. Hey, Gao. Not bad. Where are you? Hey. You have thirty minutes to get me the package. Huh? Or there's going to be a dead body at bottom of the rive Dead body? What do you want me to do? You know the Yongfu Bridge? Uh-huh. On the other side of the river. So...walk forward a little bit. And then... Walk forward a little bit more. And then...on your right... There's an empty lot on the right. Just wait for us there. Okay, I'll be right there. I'm warning you! Come alone. No cops. Orthere will be a dead body in the river! Okay, I understand. Just hold on, I'll be there. Tie him up now please. Oh, okay. What? Theywant to exchange the package for Gao. What are you going to do? I guess I should get going. Really? I guess I should take care of this myself. You're really going alone? Probably. Hey. I'm think it might be better if there's two of us. You sure you want to come? Okay. You sure you're okay? Thanks so much for listening. I'm just glad I can be here for you. So...I guess this is goodnight? Goodnight. What is this? Ji-Yong, what are you doing here? Ji-Yong? Who is he? Didn'tyou see the note I left? I saw it. Butwho's he? A friend. Hi, I'm Raymond. -A friend? -Hey. That's right. Oh yeah? Hey, why don't you calm down? I am calm! Don't do that! Raymond, are you okay? I'm okay, no need to worry. What did you push him for? He started it. I barely touched you. We were just talking, that's it. -Although... -Raymond! Yuan finally realizes you're not worth it Is that true? I... Yuan, tell him. Stay out of it. I'm sorry! Yuan, wait... I already told you. I need time to think things over. Yuan... Hey, your phone's ringing. I know. At least I'm getting Gao back. I've gotten so used to waiting. I'll just be stuck here a little longer. Being stuck here isn't so bad. Where's the package? Where's my friend? Where's the package? Where's Gao? Who? My friend. Hand it over. What are you doing? What are you doing? Let her go! Hey! Why did you hit me? Leave him alone! Hand it over! Just give us the package, okay? Did you hear me? Okay, just take it easy. Idiot. Why did you have to hit me? Let's go! Are you okay? My nose is broken! Let me see. It's not broken. But it will probably be swollen. Gao's gone, the package is gone. I'm finished. Hey, where are you going? Wait for me! Susie, wait for me! What are you doing? There has to be one! What? Look! That's not a good idea. Aren't you going a little fast? Well done, we're all set. Very good. Sir, where have you been? Where is he? Inside. Get down. Back to the Palace? Yeah. Fuck, that was lame. Seriously. Hello? Hey, uh...Kai. How's everything going? Brother Bao, I've been trying to reach you! What's wrong? Did you have the package? Yeah, I did...but someone's after me! They grabbed my friend too! Who? I don't know! They were all wearing orange suits. But you still have the package? Yeah...I still have it. -But they... -Okay, listen to me. Just get yourself to the airport. I'll take care of everything else. But Brother Bao, you don't understand. Things are a little messed up right now. Don't worry, just do what I said. -But Brother Bao... -Safe travels. Brother Bao, wait... What? Hey, watch the road! Hello! You've reached Hong's cell phone. I'm sorry that I'm unable to take your call... Hey, this is Brother Bao. Have you seen my boys there tonight? Okay. What? Let's go! Let's go, let's go. Excuse me, ma'am. Did you just see someone run in here? Quicky? Three hundred. Oh, we're not, uh... Eight hundred for the night. Okay, thanks. Does she know that you like her? No. Why not? Because I get so nervous around her. So you must really like her. Yeah. So why don't you tell her that you like her? Oh. I've thought about it. I think being in love is a beautiful thing. But you have to be brave. And be prepared for rejection. Like a man. Oh. Hey, Hong. Did you get it? We got it. We're leaving now, Hong. Hold on, hold on. Despite a few minor setbacks And a little miscommunication on my part. We still managed to make a sweet score. Excellent. Oh... It was a good try, Hong. Right. You're still our Hong. Yeah. Where are you three morons going? There's no point anymore. Oh yeah, you can have this back. Sorry, Hong. Sorry, Hong. What are you looking at? Close call. Hear anything? It's probably not this one. Hey, be careful. Wait for me here. Hey, noodle boy. What is this? Why did Brother Bao give this to you? I don't know. He doesn't know. Someone told him to bring it to Paris. Paris? Did that hurt? No. I don't believe it. There has to be something. What are you doing? Shut up. Hey, what are you doing? Come on. Where is it? French lessons? What the hell? It makes no sense. Brother Bao gave you his photo. To take to Paris... That's Brother Bao? Please be quiet. So tell me again what's really going on? I don't know. Really. Hong. Uncle. What's wrong with you kids? You don't listen to anything I say. Kai Shouldn't you be on yourway to the airport? You can go to Paris now. It's cause... Oh... Nicely done! Uncle, I was just... You wanted a big score, huh? You think I'd hand over anything important To this dipshit? I already took care of the real package. Police! Freeze! Put the gun down! It's fake. -Put it down! -Put it down! It's fake. Put it down. Huh. Go! Sir, are you okay? Go after them! Hey! What about us? Can you get your hands free? It's not tied too tightly. Can you try? Okay. Gao, come help! Oh. Did you get it? Are you okay? I'm okay. You guys? You take care of everything? I'm supposed to be retiring. No more of this shit. I'm telling you, I didn't do anything. Where are you taking me now? Back to the station? You know, I would make a good cop. What do you think? Are we going in the cop car? I want to ride shotgun. Hey, take it easy. Aren't you coming? Sir, everyone's gone. No sign of the kids either. All I found was this. Come on, get in. Let's go. What should we do now? Go back to the real estate office? Hello! Sir, are you okay? I'm fine. Get in the car. Let's go. You have time to get to the airport? Oh, I think so. Hey, are you guys hungry? A little. You want to get something to eat, Gao? Oh, no I'm stuffed. Huh? I should head back, Peach is waiting for me. Oh. Hey, tell me where you get sent. Take care. Okay, I'm going now. Bye bye. I didn't know it was so late already. It's okay. I should go home anyway But I thought you were hungry. Yeah... But it's getting kind of late. And...you should get going too. Hey, I knowwhere we can go. Hello and welcome. Peach. I thought you said only a few hours? I'm sorry. What took you so long? I ran into a few problems. Well, you're covering my next two shifts. Okay. There's more stuff that needs to be stocked. Okay. Peach. Hmm? What? See you tomorrow. Bye bye, Gao. Bye bye. What is this place? Give me a minute. Sorry, we're out of dumplings. It's okay. You sure you have time? I think so. I just have to grab my stuff upstairs. How is it? Not bad. What are you smiling about? Nothing. I was thinking about you bugging me at the bookstore. Yeah right. You were just someone to talk to. Oh. Wait a second. So l... I should...
