If you will alight here, then you will not... ...get any bus till the morning. And there is no place to stay around here too. You will get a bus only in the morning. You don't worry about me. No, who is worried. Here, i will stop it. Allah ho akbar... ...Allah ho akbar... ...hey where are you going? I will just talk to them. I request you all to maintain the peace. All of us have been surrounded by a grave problem. We have to wait for this terrorist. We have to wait for him to come out. If we want, then we can easily break the doors... ...of the temple and barge inside! But no! We cannot make this ancient temple... ...of ours impure with the blood of this terrorist! Clap! Long live! - Mother india! And that's why i request you all... ...that we all peacefully wait for this terrorist to come out. And anyway, we don't know that... ...how many terrorists are hiding inside the temple. Long live! - Mother india! Long live! - Mother india! Say! Clap! I will tell you all that what is... ...there in the bag of the terrorist. There is a drawing book. In which there are drawings of our... ...famous temples gods and goddesses. Like meera krishna. Etcetera, etcetera. That we have sent to the laboratory for examining. Clap! Keep quiet, keep quiet you all. We also found a pencil and a rubber. That i gave to this boy here as a memento. Clap! How wonderful! Some days ago the district magistrate sir said to me. He and i used to study together in school. And we are good friends too. And his wife is such a nice woman. Please excuse me, i am being a bit emotional. Forget it. The district magistrate sir told me... ...about the foreign countries and powers... ...that are conspiring against us. That want to destroy the heritage of our country... ...our ancient temple! And this terrorist has barged into... ...this temple with this intention. And i am sure, mehru, meera, krishna... ...are all code words of his mission. It is the name of the mission. Now you would like to know that... ...why did the terrorist choose this temple. Then i will tell you, that the people... ...of dholpur are so fortunate. This temple, thousands of years ago... ...was the dwelling place of our gods and goddess. You don't know this, but i knew it. I was only waiting for a special occasion. And today that occasion has come. I have demanded 2 crore rupees for this temple. Clap! So that the honour and pride of this temple can be returned. Clap! Brothers! Welcome this brave boy with a round of applause. Come on boy, come. You have done a very big thing. Come on... ...clap! How nice! Very good. Salute everyone son, come on. Clap! Yes very good. Salute everyone son. Clap! This small boy has proved that we hindus are very patriotic. This small boy, without caring for his life... ...brought the bag and gave it in dholpur police station. And informed us about this fierce terrorist. Clap! Well done boy! Long live! - Mother india! Long live! - Mother india! Friends, i will soon talk to president sir. And this boy will get the national bravery award of this year. Clap! Sir, your phone is ringing sir. Move the mike away from your mouth. Son, come here. You don't worry. Hello paltu, please talk to him. Try. Come, come. Come here. Will you tell me one thing? Osama bin laden, the terrorist how does he look. Does he have a beard? Is he tall? And could he not be osama bin laden, could he be saddam. Saddam has been caught. These americans are very big liars. They must have caught a fake saddam. You say son. Say, say what you exactly saw. You scoundrel, are you drunk early in the morning. I swear by goddesses saraswati... ...i will kill you if you will interfere in between. You do your own work. You are telling me! You dare catch my collar! I'll show you. I will talk to you later. I will kill you! I will ruin you! He hit me first! I have called reporters from all over the country... ...and you are fighting like dogs. Manner less! I was just doing my job. What is your name? - Gopinath. Your name is gopinath. When did you wash your face last? I was just doing my job... ...why don't you understand? Listen to me, listen. Go home and wash your face. I have called reporters from all over the country... ...not to look at your face. Come on move from here. Move! I know that the terrorist osama bin laden is hiding in there. But they all want to bank on it. I will break your spectacles. I will kill you. Don't be afraid, don't be afraid you all. Look we have to find the terrorist group... ...through this terrorist. This terrorist will be killed, that is for sure. But finding his group is much more important. We will find out his group and eradicate it. Clap! Clap. And that is why i request to you all to maintain the peace. And not kill this terrorist inside the temple. Keep in mind the purity of the temple. The temple should not be made impure. That is all i want to say to you all. I am leaving right now, i will return soon. Thank you, thank you. Hail india. Hail india! National unity party. - Hail!

Then, when we will go to see the film then... ...we will eat our most favourite film. You know which one? Vanilla ice cream. - Vanilla ice cream. And then, what will papa get? Fairy. S. P, do i have to call the president to get you here. Will i have to fax him? The entire world has gathered here. And what are you doing there? And listen, bring priest along. Don't waste our time.

I cannot see you clearly. I want to see you... ...you are just a child. Son, i want to tell you something. The muslims nearby have hid themselves inside their houses. And any mistake from you, can be deadly for them. I know that they will not break down the door now. They will at least wait for the higher officials to arrive. But son, they will surely break down the doors... ...son, please shoot yourself as soon as they break down the doors. Don't be caught alive son. Son, for allah's sake. Don't harm anyone. You know what will be the result. They want you to surrender. But do you know what will happen when you surrender. The crowd that is standing outside here. They will kill you. They are all thirsty for your blood. I don't know son that who are you... ...where have you come from and what do you want. But i know that you will not survive. People from all over the country are gathering here. A very big conspiracy is being hatched. Son, when these people... ...when these people cannot fight hunger and poverty. Then they fight us. So that they forget their other grave problems. This crowd will forget all their problems watching you die. Even though just for a moment. But they will feel happy seeing you die. Even if for a few moments. Son, allah will help you son. How many men are there? Take him. Come priest sir. There is no need to worry sir. No, minister sir is just too excited. Yes.

Have you talked to him? Look madam, this is a very delicate matter... ...i won't be able to tell you much about it. But all this operation is under you. What arrangements have you done? You can see the arrangements. The police are situated everywhere. And we are always in contact with the centre. And everything is under control. And there is no need to panic at all. So, is this an official government statement? Madam i have told you that i cannot... ...tell you anything more than that. That's all. The priest had first met the terrorist. Isn't that your work? I mean the police should have contacted him first. Did you send the priest because he is muslim? Switch off the camera. Madam, now you will teach the police their duty. This is the problem of you channel people. You always spice up the matter. But you never tell the fact to anyone. If there is no problem, then you will... ...make the hindus and the muslims fight. If you dare switch on the camera then i will... ...it does not matter if you have come in the beginning or the end. What matters is what you are telling. Keep the camera off. Chaubey. - Yes sir. Switch on the camera. As you can see the s. P is here... ...yes sir. If there is a call from home then... ...tell them that i will call back. Okay, fine sir. Where are you going sir?

Then why are you hiding here? I am not hiding here, i am just... ...where have you come from? - Lucknow. Where do you want to go? - I don't know. Where do you live in lucknow? What difference does that make? That sketchbook is yours. Sketchbook. - Yes. You have made those designs. - Yes. Why? Which weapons do you have? Where have you hidden the rdx? Which other temples do you plan to destroy tell me. I don't know anything. And if you will try to break down the door... ...then i will shoot myself. I will surely shoot myself. And like your minister sir said. I will make your temple impure with my blood. What do you get from all this? And what do you think? How long can you hide here? Surrender yourself, okay. This meera, krishna, mehru are they your code words. Who is the leader of your organization? Master pasha. Who is meera? Who is krishna? Mehru. Who are all of them master pasha? Master pasha, who are all of them? Love. True love. Love some one anwar, then you will know the truth of life. Love, that has truth, sacrifice and trust. Like... Meera's love for krishna. And krishna's love for meera. Meera immersed herself in krishna's love. And krishna in meera's love. Wonderful. When two people unite in love. Or shall we say, that they both cross all the boundaries. That is love. Rest all are love stories anwar. Heer ranjha, romeo and juliet. Only love stories. Love, that's all. This life is so colorless without love anwar. Where did you get lost? Did you love anyone, like meera loved krishna? I loved her a lot. A lot of love. You know, i could not sleep at nights. How could anyone sleep with so much love inside him? It felt as if, my chest will burst open. But, after her death everything changed. My meera's death made me insane. Me... Do i look mad. Three months, three months i stayed in the sanatorium. When there is so much love inside you. You feel like sharing it. But when there is no one to share... ...it with then one will turn mad. It is a very unusual thing anwar, love. It can even make you mad. Okay, i am leaving right now i have to go to work. Yesterday i posed as a blind... ...person today i will pose as a cripple. This is the only thing that i don't like about you. You are such a talented actor. Why don't you join the theatre again sir? You are very talented sir. I was never talented anwar. Not even today. It was love that taught us everything. I am again in search of love. If i find it, then i will become talented again. Now let me go, we will meet in the evening. 'Love someone anwar, then you... ...will know the real meaning of life.' 'Like... Meera's love for krishna.' 'And krishna's love for meera.' 'Meera immersed herself in krishna's love.' 'And krishna in meera's love.' I know who you are. You are meera. Don't leave me. I don't want to lose you. There is a lot of love in my heart. So much love that i feel that i will go crazy. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Mehru. Mehru. My allah, my allah, my allah, my allah. My allah, my allah, my allah, my allah. Your eyes.

Now do you want me to cut into that? I don't particularly care. Just try and get an interview of the terrorist guy. Yeah. But frankly speaking i don't think... ...anybody is inside the temple. I think these people of dholpur are insane. I have not yet met a man who is not drunk. Please keep your voice down. You are not in delhi anymore, you know. Nobody is listening. Nobody is listening to me. Okay, listen. Try and get an interview of the terrorist. Okay. Try and make some contact with him. All right. Anita! Okay. I will get back to you. Forget about the past. The past is no more. I don't know who made you the creative head of the channel. Sure. Now you fall in love with some girl's finger. It happens. You fall... in love with some girl's hair. You fall in love with her face mole. With eyes... it happens. I mean you can fall in love with anything. What to do? You just fall in love. Its only love. It's nothing wrong. Once. Just once. Some girl... Should say to me... Just for me... ...for my happiness that i love you. That's it. That's it. The end. Move! Anita-ji. You look very tense. Any problem? Anita-ji. I want an interview with the terrorist. I can do anything for you. Seriously. Yeah. Come. We will talk to him. We will talk to him. Tiwari! Tiwari, i am talking to you. Tiwari! Ma'am wants an interview with the terrorist. So make the arrangement. I am not your father's servant! I will pump so many bullets in your skull... ...that even your mother won't be able to recognise your face! Understood! Move! Have you gone mad? Tiwari, have you gone made? Ma'am, he has gone mad. You wait here. I will make some arrangement for you. I will get you transferred to kala handi. You have lost your senses. Idiot, you hit me on my lips! And i will clean my house with your uniform! Listen to me, tiwari! You don't know me. Where is my phone! Give my phone. My... My wife... is breathing her last. Zoom! Zoom on him! How can i live without her? My child called me just now. Only half an hour or one hour, that's it. Ma'am... So what if i am a police officer. My heart is filled with love. I loved only once in my life. With my wife. And she is dying. And i can't go. And this... Terrorist anwar... ...till the time he doesn't surrender... ...i won't be able to go. He is not a terrorist! I know it! I don't know why he is hiding here. And these idiots... ...my wife is dying and... And i can't go to meet my beloved. Don't shoot. Anita... what... ...mehru. Anwar. Anwar. Anwar. Anwar. I know... You are not a terrorist. By the way i am anita. My heart says that you are not a terrorist. Then these people... ...me and a terrorist? Please explain to... ...them that i am not a terrorist. And i didn't kill anybody. Please tell them. Will you tell them? I will tell them that you are not a terrorist. But you will have to surrender. I promise you that nothing will happen to you. I will help you. Mehru must have sent you. Mehru? No? Then... ...if you met mehru in this crowd then tell her... ...that i didn't kill her. I didn't kill her. I love her. I love her immensely. I am waiting here for mehru. If she can't come to meet me here, then fine. I will go to meet her in her new house. Mehru? Who is mehru? If you want i will talk to her and bring her here. Anwar, are you listening to me? Anwar! You don't know mehru? You don't know mehru. You don't know mehru. You don't know mehru. Mehru. Mehru. - Yes. Even if i worked round the clock all my life... ...still i can't take you to america. As it is america is a city of destruction. There they always drop bomb. And your britney spears... i think she is mad. You are much more talented than her. And much prettier. Look, anwar. Don't mind. But your thinking is very narrow-minded. And america... it is the dream country of millions of people. Only when you venture out of lucknow will you... ...come to know how much the world has progressed. And anwar, i hate this country. Everywhere there is dust, dirt, filth, people, heat. You have to venture out of your house in a frightened state. I don't want to live in this country. But i love you, mehru. Anwar, love is fine. But love doesn't make life. Your research on temples is futile. You have to be practical in life. Your friend... what's his name... Udit. Look at udit. He has done computer engineering. And he has got a job in america. Now you should be like him. And people with whom you socialize like master pasha... ...they are useless. Even they couldn't achieve anything. They are just losers. Losers? Losers mean what? Anwar, look. You should not feel bad. But i only wish you well. And... ...anwar, we should move from here. These constables are mad. Let them come. We won't go. - What! I want to talk to you. - Don't act childishly. Hey! Hey! Lovers! Get up! Get up! I will talk to them. What are you both doing here alone? And why have you held her hands? Forgive us. We will leave right now. Where are you going? Where are you going? And what is in your pocket? What is in your pocket? Condom. Look, mind your language. I see! So you will teach me manners! You will teach me manners! Come on! Hold your ears! Hold your ears and do sit ups. And you... Aren't you a muslim lady? Why didn't you wear 'burkha'? You are roaming around like a heroine. You won't find customers. Anwar! You dare to raise your hands on a police officer! Anwar! You dare to raise your hands on a police officer! No, anwar! Call somebody from the police station! Go! He is mad! He is mad! Anwar, please leave him! Anwar! Anwar, give me your hand! Give me your hand! No! Anwar! Let's go. I hate this country. Love. Master pasha, you are here. Since when i was searching for you. Come, anwar. What has happened to you? Lts nothing. The lane which i visited as a leper... ...i went there as a blind man. So people bashed me up. I wanted to talk to you urgently. I have fallen in love. Love. Yes. We will talk about the rest at home. You quickly turn around the cycle. We can't say anything about the public. They thrashed me black and blue. Let's go quickly. When i thought. My eyes brimmed with tears. When i thought. Dipti... it took you 1 year to find me. You say that... i am the only one in the entire india... ...who can build such a temple set. Anwar... She searched for me for an entire year. You have told me this 99 times in the past one-hour. Say it once more and you will complete the century. You don't understand. Are you sure that she too... ...there is so much love in her eyes, anwar. The way she looks at me... Smiles... ...i am sure... That she loves me. You don't tell her about this injury. Clean this place. She is about to come. Where have you removed your slippers? You don't understand at all. Clean this. Remove this from here. Remove this slipper from here. What are you doing? You don't understand. Remove the liquor bottles from here. You see, girls prefer things kept neatly and tidily. Otherwise what happens is that... ...yes. How are you? Greetings. Dipti. You... Please sit. Come. He is anwar, my friend. - Okay. Hi. He is doing his hindi honours. And he is researching on temples. Dipti-ji. Anwar. - Yes. And he is doing research on temples. - Yes. Very interesting. What happened to you? - He fell down. He fell on the street. You know the plight of lucknow streets, don't you? What are you doing? Are you badly hurt? - No. Its nothing. I have got a copy of the play i told you about. - Okay. There are 3 characters. 3 characters. But only one actor will play all the 3 characters. This is what i have thought about the play. - Okay. But the main part about the play is its set. And i am sure that only you can make the set. I have got some papers... and some pencil too. 'Dipti... There is so much love in your eyes.' 'I feel that you should go on saying something... ...and i should go on listening to you.' By the way there are other things about the play too. 'I should go on looking at you.' But maybe it's enough for today. I will leave now, sir. No, no. You... You... At least have tea. - I will make tea. Go and get the tea from the confectioner shop. I will get it but... ...no, sir. Not today... - Bring snacks from the confectioner shop. No, sir. I will have it the next time i come. - Listen... ...everybody is waiting for me for the rehearsals. I will get it but... ...i can't wait today. Take care. I will leave now. Goodbye. She didn't even have tea. Anwar... How do we look together? Good. But i think you both should spend some time together. To know each other better. Maybe she just likes your work. But i love her. And that is sufficient for me. To love somebody... is a great thing, anwar. Do you know... Countless people in the world die without loving. One moment spent in love... is much more than... ...a life spanning across thousands of years. You think that i am making a... ...mockery of myself by falling in love. Then i would like to remain a fool forever. Foolish... And mad. Mad and foolish. I don't know why. One moment didn't pass the whole night. One moment didn't pass... ...brother! Brother! Your hindu... udit has come. Feeling nice? Yes. Dear, on my knees. He is not outside. I saw him outside. I thought he is coming to meet you. So i informed you. Are you sure he was udit, suraiyya? Yes, brother. He was udit. If it was his ghost, then it is a different matter. Suraiyya. - Yes, mother. I am feeling a bit worried. Mother, you don't worry. You will get well by this week. The medicine that mehru's uncle has send from kakori... ...that is really good, mother. What are you doing? Are you mad? - Its nothing. What if mother wakes up? Actually i was searching for something. I am sorry. I am fine. Where are you nowadays? I am making arrangement for us. Paperwork and the rest. And these american embassy people are fools. If they had a fight with their wife at night... ...then the next day the visa is rejected. I got my visa. And i am out of here. 4 people were in front of me. Just seeing them, they rejected their visa. They were khans. Tell me one thing, anwar. Why do you guys want to look different from the rest? Darwin has said that separating... ...from your species is the beginning of an end. Darwin was not a muslim. And that too in an independent country like ours. If he had been, he would have understood. As to why a 15 years old boy is taught to make a bomb. And why he is taught to start hating the world... ...before the world starts hating him. After september 11, muslims all over the world... ...are been considered as terrorists. By the way, i can go on and on and on. Had you come to my house day before yesterday? Day before yesterday? No. 4-3. Last time's score. Come. How long will you lose from me? At least win once before i leave for america. Yes. Look. - Good shot. Look, i know that you are very busy. So i won't take much time. I want to say something. But many times you want to say something... ...but in haste you don't say what you want to say... ...and you end up saying all that you didn't want to say. I love you. I am not a beggar! I am an artist! At times i am blind, at times crippled... ...at times dumb and at times deaf. The whole world trusts me! The whole world is my stage! Only you didn't trust me. Why do you think that i am just a beggar? A mad beggar. Anwar. Dipti said that... i am mentally crippled. You... what do you think? I don't want to trouble you. These are some temple sketches... ...that i had drawn for dipti. Maybe... You will meet her. If you get the chance then give it to her. I want to stay alone for a while, anwar. Please. I am not a beggar! I am not a beggar! So welcome master pasha! Master pasha! Master pasha! Master pasha! Master pasha! He has loads of love in his heart. Love! Love! Love! Love! He is not a beggar. He is an artist. He is an artist! He is an artist! He is an artist! And i am sure that only you can make the temple's set. And i am sure that only you can make the temple's set. Udit. We are from lucknow. So the embassy people can reject our visa. It's not easy to get a visa. I couldn't believe it. The passport was in my hand. And us visa. Very less people... ...my beloved went far away from me. She stole the solace of my heart. She left behind the shadow of sorrow. Now nothing is left besides this sorrow. My beloved went far away from me. She stole the solace of my heart. She left behind the shadow of sorrow. Now nothing is left besides this sorrow. There were only tears. Now tears too have been washed away. My heartbeats say that i should stop somewhere here. Before leaving i have decided to marry... Mehru. You are a hindu. You know that, don't you? If you think that she has nobody in this world besides... ...her mother then let me tell you... That you are wrong. If her relatives got an inkling of this then... ...your body parts will be found in the ditches of lucknow. And as far as mehru is concerned, she will disappear. And all this will happen just because i am a hindu? Yes. And you think all this should happen. No, all this shouldn't happen. But i know that all this will happen. What if i eloped with mehru? You think that the world is vast. But bigger than that is that you are a... ...hindu and mehru is a muslim. Her relatives will set the world ablaze. What century are you talking about, anwar? This century. The century in which you and i are living. The century that is surrounding it. It will be better if you stopped meeting mehru. And stop visiting our houses too. Mehru. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose you. Don't leave me and go. Anwar, mother will wake up. - Let her. Don't act like a child. I won't be able to live without you. I will die. Anwar, forgive me. But i don't want to say anything right now. Mehru, i love you. But i never loved you. Hit me! Hit me! - What are you doing? Hit me! Hit me! - Leave me! Because i have loved you! My heartbeats say that i should stop somewhere here. My heartbeats say that i should stop somewhere here. My soul detached away with me. My dream shattered. I lost my beloved. Why did i receive this punishment? My soul detached away with me. My dream shattered. I lost my beloved. Why did i receive this punishment? There were only tears. Now tears too have been washed away. My heartbeats say that i should stop somewhere here. Those moments dispersed far away. There is only loneliness in this heart. I am lonely. I have no hope left. There is only painful ambiance. I am alive. But i am not in my senses. When my beloved is not with me. There is only love and no zest left. I am in a trance. Now there is only doomsday. My beloved went far away from me. She stole the solace of my heart. She left behind the shadow of sorrow. Now nothing is left besides this sorrow. My beloved went far away from me. She stole the solace of my heart. She left behind the shadow of sorrow. Now nothing is left besides this sorrow. Dear, you have come. - Don't worry, aunty. Listen... Have you seen her anywhere? Aunty, i have searched the entire lucknow city. But she is nowhere to be found. I think she is not in this city. I know where is mehru. And then she changed her mind. Uncle! You have grown old. But there is no dearth in your derogatory nature. And then she changed her mind. The culture of lucknow is being divided into two parts. Yes. You are right, brother. Yesterday i had gone to saharaganj. One girl had worn clinging pants and short top. Brother, everything was visible. And nowadays youngsters are in the trance of love. You are right, brother. Up 32 z 4474. Brother, the bus has arrived. Stop. Stop it. Brother, the gun. - No. Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't start! Mehru. Mehru. Greetings. Brother is waiting for you outside. Udit-bhai, please come outside. We want to talk urgently with you. Come. Mehru, don't worry. Hey, don't go! Mehru is my aunt's daughter. She is like my sister. If you loved her so much, then what was the need to elope? You should have told me. I would have got both of you married. Let it be. You tend to make mistakes in youth. Will you eat mango? It is from mallihabad. What fire have you started? What fire have you started? What fire have you started? What fire have you started? Aunty! Idiot! You had to do all this! You have tarnished the family's image. I can't face anybody in the whole city of luckbow. Why did you do this? Shut her in the upstairs room. Allah! Why didn't i die before seeing this day! Why did you create love? Why did you create pain? Why did you create pain? Why did you create pain? Very good! May allah bestow you with a long life! There is a limit of shameful deeds! This girl has tarnished our image! Characterless! Lock her here itself! Stop her supply of food and water for a week. - Yes. I don't know now who will marry this girl! This idiot will now trouble us... ...i feel like strangulating her! Come on, the bus is about to leave. Rae bareilly, barabanki, sultanpur, dholpur... ...will the bus go to rishikesh? - No. From where can i catch the bus? - From benaras. Brother and sisters! No need to fear the rains! A bus has departed from the city. You all remain calm. And take shelter somewhere. And i request all the parents not to worry. Keep your children with you. And yes a boy who is 9 years old... ...and he has worn tricolour shirt. If anybody finds him, then please inform us. Thanks. Leave! Leave! Nobody will leave. The current is very strong. Quickly inform sp sir. He might do anything. He might be carrying anything. He might be a human bomb! Move! Move! Move! Anything can happen! He is playing the charade of dying! He is playing the charade of dying! Can't you guys understand? You think i am jesting! Nobody should come ahead. He is not dead! He is not dead! Move back! Move back! Where are you coming! Move back! I know who are you. Anwar. Once when you were a kid, you had cried a lot... ...seeing the broken wings of a butterfly. I also know that your heart is filled with love. And you want to immerse yourself in me. So why are you waiting? Respect to self and respect to your nation. I have locked eyes with you. I have locked eyes with you. I have locked eyes with you, my beloved. My heart is not in my control, my beloved. I have locked eyes with you, my beloved. My heart is not in my control, my beloved. Love is a life in itself. Love is a life in itself. I have locked eyes with you. And i found light. My heart united with yours. And i found life. I have locked eyes with you. And i found light. My heart united with yours. And i found life. Love is a life in itself. Love is a life in itself.
