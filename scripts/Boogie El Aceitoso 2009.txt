I was in Laos, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Namibia. I have shot black rebels in South Africa. And I also saw hundreds of comrades die. All my life I have prepared for combat. I trained very hard, I became expert on the most various weapons. We used to know what to stick to: there was an enemy. You could go and work as a mercenary and when you came back, the Reds were there waiting for you. Now they swear they are no longer our enemies. We should destroy them! I enjoyed shooting badly fed and worst trained soldiers; having bad beer and beans; hell, under development and backwardness. I was in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Iraq, in the Gulf War. I've been in every fucking war in the Third World. You can change the scenery, you can change the jungle, but luckily... there's always gonna be someone you can hit hard. You got ten dollars? I'm sure you got ten dollars left. Come on, just ten dollars to buy books. What for? To study. Don't wanna turn in to a criminal. They got an answer for everything. I won't encourage your laziness, but I'll give you thirty dollars if you help me out. Yes sure, sir. I know you and your friends destroy and burn stores, right? Yes, yes sir. You only have to kick... that door. Get your dollars ready, sir. Why do I bother to create sources of income for the poor? I got something for you too. Damn it, I'm turning into a sentimental fool. You're very pretty, you look incredible. As always, Marcia. Boogie... may I sit here? I enjoy talking to you. You're different, not like the others. You don't care what people think or if you hurt somebody, you just do what you want, when you want and that's it. You say what you think. I haven't seen Sonny for a week. Whenever he returns from a trip I'm nervous. I wonder if I like him. Be honest, do I look pretty? This new make-up suit me? And this dress and shoes? Your eyes resemble those of a batrachian. I've never seen such a toad-like face. I didn't notice it before cause I was shocked at your obesity. In just a week you've turned into a barrel. Your legs resemble those of a pachyderm. But nothing can be compared with your breath. Shit! It stinks like the sewers of Saigon. Listen, Marcia, don't get upset, you wanted the truth. Thanks, nobody's ever been so honest. It's okay. I got a job to do for Sonny. Marcia, your favorite. Lewis Reegan reporting for "War and Family". Another day in the Sonny Calabria trial, the alleged capo, il capi di tutti capi. He's suspected of being responsible for80%... of the criminal activity in the city, and for the massacre carried out three months ago. Maybe he's getting near the end. This court adjourns until Monday at 8 am, when the prosecutor will have to present his mysterious witness. Not a minute later. Does anyone know where the witness is? No, nobody. You know how important it is that it remains that way. You won't get away this time, Calabria. Once the jury has heard the evidence, you'll be in deep water. dead, castrated, dismembered, and sold as dog food! Damn it! Threes months without being able... to open this silly briefcase. Have you fixed the judge? He's incorruptible. And the prosecutor? He works for Russia. What if the witness doesn't get to testify? The judge will have no choice but to dismiss the case. I want you to eliminate that traitor. You know who can do the job. Hello, Mr. McCoy. I've finished my job. I'll send you the bill. I'm sorry but there was a mistake. My secretary wrote down the wrong name. You didn't have to kill Gary. Who's Gary? Wait a minute, Gary is alive but he won't make it. He looks like a plasma ad. He's got a big hemorrhage. Can he speak? I said hemorrhage, not verbiage! Apply a tourniquet, quickly! I'll send a company doctor! Listen, I'll charge you for "Dead Man". Don't expect a discount or a "Badly Injured" rate, okay? We've got to discuss it, Boogie. I'd pay you, but I'll be in trouble with the administration. We'll see. Good evening, I'm the company doctor. This man is dead! Did you apply a tourniquet? Yes. Since he had a wound on his chest I applied it on his neck. I'm afraid I've strangled him. Boogie, I got a job for you. You'll have to pay more. But you don't know what I want. To take care of the witness against Sonny. How much do you want? But that's twice your normal rate! Look, you'd better ask Sonny if his freedom... isn't worth that money. Hey what's this? Fire, fire! Call the firemen! Fire! And I'll tell you why. At first I was impressed by your personality, your character, your feigned lack of interest for me. Even by your predilection for violence. Boogie, I'm talking to you! But over time your image began to fade out. Your lack of interest was just that: lack of interest. Like right now. Good... That's why you can't come to spend the night at my apartment. Toxic, play something for my baby. Something sweet? Don't, Toxic. Don't do it. Its unbelievable. At least I deserve your attention. Shit! That asshole can't take his eyes off you. Listen, you shit! What do you want with the lady? You've never seen a woman? No, no. Sir... What? Sir, no, I... I got a glass eye. No, I'd never.. Fucking pervert! You'll think twice before playing the playboy! Listen... My God, Boogie! That was incredible! Really rough. I love the way you protect me. How many things the government has taught us in the Gulf. Oh Boogie! Oh Boogie! Yes, baby. Boogie! Baby, baby... Tell me that you love me. Don't you have anything to tell me? You're disgustingly thin. Hi, Su. Suuuuuuu? Mom? Mommy. What a surprise! I was near and decided to stop by. Good, good. That's great! Are you nervous? Anything wrong? The thing is... I'm not alone. Has Stella stayed over? Stella? No... Boogie, this is my mother. My God! Is this the man you told me about? He looks extremely rude! Oh God! How rude! You said he didn't even notice you or pay attention to you! Does he keep beating you? No, not as hard as before. Why don't you tell him to leave once and for all? A couple of minutes ago, he stared at me and told me, "you're disgustingly thin." Can you see it, mom? He's started to pay attention to me! Shall I call Boogie? Boogie is old. He uses old-fashioned methods. He belongs... to the past. We need new blood. Someone... discreet, efficient, modern... Someone that's on my level. And less expensive so I can keep the difference. I didn't get it. Are you... Boogie? Who's asking? I'm Captain Derek. You'll have to come with me. You can't call me every time... you want to leave a bar without paying. I need to ask you a question. Why do you keep doing this? What? Drinking? Cause I like it. No, working. You could retire and live in peace. Who said I want to live in peace? We must maintain the system. What did you want to ask me? Where they keep the witness. What for? They gave the job to another guy. Who's he? A new boy... who's been making fast progress. He's cold, a calculating man. Agile. Expert in martial arts. His name is... Blackburn. Jim Blackburn. lf you buy cheaply, you pay dearly. Forget about the 500 grand, now I want... one million. Business is changing. You're no longer the same, Boogie. Where are they hiding the witness? You'd better find some new activity. I'm gonna find out somehow. Where do they keep him? At the Gran Hotel. Fucking idiot, my car! I'm gonna kill you! Quickly to the hospital! No guards at the entrance. That's too bad. Cheers, pal! Oh no! I hate when others get all the fun! You've reached the police station. Wait and one of our professionals will be with you shortly. In case of robbery, press 1. In case of kidnapping, press 2. If you are caught in a shoot-out, press 3. The perfect woman. Yes, yes! You're really disgusting. Ow, don't! Help me please! Boogie... Its a pleasure to finally meet the famous Boogie. I'll introduce myself. I'm Jim Blackburn. I don't care who you are. You're slow. Your time has passed. Let's put an end to this once and for all. Fucking bastard! I'm the best. Don't... Ow wait, Boogie! Stop! Stay where you are! Turn yourself in! Help! Wait, Boogie, wait! Boogie, I knew you'd rescue me. I don't even know who you are. Its me, Marcia! Marcia? Boogie? When Sonny finds out, he'll go crazy. You still have batrachians eyes. But now you look like a tadpole instead of a toad. Oh God! You're Little Apple! You got the wrong fruit. I sprained my ankle, Boogie. I used to live next door to your mom when you were a child. A real little devil. You shot Mr. Mulligan's eye out with your air rifle. I'll never forget that rifle. You loved the cakes and the chicken soup your granny made. I hated... The soup? No, my granny. I remember when they told you off for sticking your tongue out at her... with a big stick! You were eight and you still wetted yourself! I drank too much beer. Bye, Little Apple. Its been a great pleasure to see you again. Little Apple? What have you done, beast! She knew too much. You'll pay for this! Don't expect me to thank you. This is all your fault! My fault? It was you who opened that sewer mouth of yours! You said I looked like a pachyderm so I decided to lose weight. I changed the color of my hair, bought contact lenses, had a breast surgery. But Sonny likes obese girls! After all that effort, hours and hours of workout and surgery, he left me for a 330-pound! That's why I've decided to testify against him. I didn't tell you to do anything. It was your own stupidity. Still no clues to the whereabouts of the witness disappeared at the Gran Hotel. Police continue to dig through rubble. They've only found... bodies. I'm Lewis Reegan reporting for "War and Family". You should've been more discreet. We didn't do that. So who did it? Boogie took the witness. What? But doesn't Boogie work for us? Doesn't he work for us? Well... we hired Blackburn. Boogie asked too much money. Listen to me. I want you to kill Boogie and the witness. Understood? Where are we going? Boogie? Boogie, are you all right? Boogie? Boogie... Do you want me to drive? There are only two places for women: the kitchen and the bed. Take a needle and thread. Needle and thread? You're a woman. You can sew. You'll have to close my wound. What makes you believe I won't let you die? That'd mean you're more stupid than you look. Without me you wouldn't last ten minutes out there. You need me to survive. What do you need me for? To show them they were wrong, that I'm still the best. Go ahead. I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna destroy you! Can you buy me a burger? He better not come near me. Take a vacation. You must disappear. Don't talk nonsense. lf they want to find me, they know where to look for. You found me, right? Can you buy me a burger? Open your fucking mouth and close your eyes. And now get out of here or you'll be sorry! I accept their existence, not their talking or looking at me. Look, everybody is looking for you. I'm risking my neck being with you. That's your problem. You live thinking in the future. But I live for the moment, without worrying. I do what I want, when I want. I've seen what you do and I like your style... and your muscles. We could do good business together. Call me. Don't forget. I thought you couldn't stand them. Some of them are inevitable. I belong to the largest racist community: the one that hates the poor. Fucking pills. The only sense I got intact... is the sense of rhythm. Down here, assholes. A doctor... I need... a doctor. You really do, but I'm not a doctor. I give work to doctors. Who sent you? I won't talk... until I see a doctor. There are two ways of doing this, but the result will be the same. Go to hell! Calabria! Sonny Calabria! A doctor. I need a doctor. It won't be necessary. Anyway you had lost much blood. Marcia? Oh Boogie! I heard shots and... Marcia! Marcia, you're an idiot. I'm sorry. I heard shots and then someone going down the stairs. When I saw it was you, I couldn't hold back my joy. Don't worry. I know you didn't mean that. You didn't mean to hurt me. I can't hit a target 6 feet away! You're getting old, Boogie. What did you say? Nothing. We must go. Isn't that your car? They know it. Let's find a new one. Boogie! Things used to be different, but I'm no longer the same. When I was in second grade, a 7-year old kid gave me a beating. But you were a kid. It was two years ago. I was the History teacher. But it's all over now. Karate has changed my life. I would've just lent you the car before, but not now. My blows would break a 240-pound gorilla like you like shattered glass. How much weight can you lift? Do you think I'm impressed or intimidated? Just give me the car, Tom. Don't say I didnt warn you. Some reactionaries won't admit progress. When gunpowder was invented, Karate was finished. How could you do that? We needed the car. But did you have to kill him? He stood in my way. Let's say I eliminate obstacles. Why are you like this? You feel nothing when you kill? lf I use a silencer... I feel nothing. All human affairs are alien to me. I didn't know you liked daybreaks. They bring back good memories... of happy moments. Of what? The napalm odor in the morning... It smells like victory. That's "Apocalypse now". And it's one hundred percent true. Oh you like movies. I'm sure you bought your .44 Magnum after watching "Dirty Harry". You like him, right? Love matters kinda bore me. I want to speak with Sonny. Who's calling? Santa Claus. Come on, Santa doesn't exist. I'm Boogie, you idiot. Sonny... Sonny? Its me. What's up? Boogie. He wants to talk with you. Boogie! How are you? Don't worry about me, you better worry about you. I'm fine, Boogie. To remain that way, you'll have to pay me a million dollars. Why would I do that? 'Cause I've got something you want. Fucking traitor! You're selling me! You are a... Marcia! Its Marcia, the witness! And if you don't pay, on Monday at 8 am she'll go to testify. In 24 hours you can find me atkilometer77 of the highway, where you use to go hunting, otherwise Marcia will see you in court. Is that clear? Very clear. One more thing. lf you keep sending thugs, I'll have to kill all of them and that will increase the rate. Understood? Understood. No mistakes this time! No mistakes this time! Make sure Blackburn does the job. You're a horrible beast! Let go of me! Disgusting worm, let me go! I like rough women. Leave me alone! Fucking bastard! Keep still, will you!? Your karma must be terrible. You don't believe in it, right? I don't even believe in penicillin. Oh, now what? I'm hungry. Pass me the salt, grandpa. Who the hell are you to call me that? Excuse him, he didn't mean to... I'm not your grandpa and I'd never be, filthy pig! Good... I'm neither your maid so as to pass you anything, beast! I didn't mean to offend you. I just wanted to be nice. I loved my grandpa Jonas. Its all right, I'm sorry. The truth is I got worked up. I'm sorry, I'm very nervous. Boogie! My God... Jerk! Always wait for the other to lower his guard. Why are you so violent? Is it the society we live in? I think violence is the main character of our era. Leave my potatoes alone! Why would a child chop an insect or hurt a cat... or beat another child? I won't say it again! Why so much religious violence, so much violence in Africa? Listen to me and dont forget it. The main cause for violence... is that some people want to take food from others. Enough now! Its not that bad. That'll teach you not to touch my potatoes. Fuck you! Excuse me, I'm with the League of Fight Against Cancer. You poison my air. Are you trying to quit smoking? I chew tobacco. You're committing suicide. Everyone has the right to choose how to die. Of course not. Excuse me. You have no right to destroy a precious mechanism as the human body. Excuse me. Don't do that. How much do you smoke? Ten. Cigarettes? Packets. Oh God! You're a cynical case of lack of will. Excuse me. Maybe you think I use drastic methods. You'll understand... I told you everyone has the right to choose how to die. Officer! Marcia? Excuse me. Officer, officer! Officer, officer! I've just finished my patrol. That man has kidnapped me. I'm sorry. My patrol is over and honestly... What's up with you? Are you deaf? That man, Boogie... Is that Boogie? Damn it! I can't believe I missed again. This was not really necessary. Hey, what's up? That's Boogie. And what's he doing here? He's looking for her. Come on, hand her over! Where's... Williams? In the toilet. I got nothing against you. I don't want to kill cops, just give me my tadpole. Don't you have anything in exchange for us? Fucking corrupts. I can give you 500. Its an honor to meet you. Let's go. Your end is near. Whose house is this? A friends. Is he expecting you? I'm sure he forgot. Why did you do it? I don't get why you saved me from the cop. I don't know. Maybe 'cause you saved me before. Have you ever had a serious relationship with a woman? Besides my mother. Yes, besides your mother. Yes, once. Look, Sonia, you can ramble whatever you want on women's rights, but I already have my own opinion. I know that in the end every woman wants to get married, have kids and a man to give her orders and set limits. Oh Boogie, how can you say such absurd things? Have you got a light? Many women love things to be forbidden to them, like smoking, drinking or low-necked dresses. They must be stupid women. Just as there are stupid men, there are stupid women. I asked for a light. Women want men who treat them like dirt, with a firm hand, and even... beat them. Listen, fucking pig, you can't say that! I won't argue with you. Now you'll listen to me, worthless pig! Forget it. You can't argue. I can't... stupid beast! You dirty male chauvinist! Do not insist. Listen, gorilla. Are you deaf or stupid? Have you got a light or not! Oh God! I almost lose an eye! Be grateful I didn't throw it lit. See, Sonia? In the end, all women want to be beaten. You're a beast! The things I have to put up with for a miserable meal! But you know what? I'm tired, I'm sick of your arrogance, your bad manners, your disdain! I deserve something better than you! Its better to be on your own... than in the company of a psychopath! I should've said it long ago! Filthy pig! Sonia, it's raining. I'd better drive you home. No! I dont want to see you again! Here. The car keys. Take it and leave it anywhere. I'll walk. The rain will clear my mind. I appreciate your sincerity. Call me tomorrow... if you want. Didn't you ask for a light? I felt those guys at the restaurant were following me. Don't you ever feel anything at all? I told you all human affairs are alien to me. You're not a bad guy, Boogie. Society has turned you into that. Marcia, dont justify me. Your job doesn't help to make you more sensitive, but... you could try some human gesture. The mime at least. You know what? When we got here and you lit the fireplace, it was cold outside and warm inside. You served me some whisky... This house had an apple pie fragrance. And... when you put your hand on mine... I really think... I felt something. A sensation almost forgotten. Oh Boogie... What did you feel? Disgust! What's this? After the scene you made at the restaurant I can't set you free. And I'd like to get some sleep. Excuse me, Sonny... He's here. Let him in. Its an honor to meet you in person, Mr. Calabria. Well, we finally come face to face, Blackburn, or rather what Boogie left of yours. lf that gorilla had not interfered, today the witness would be your dessert. Two things. First, make sure that treacherous bitch doesn't appear in court on Monday. And second... Listen to me. Once you have Marcia with you, take care of Boogie. It'll be a pleasure, you know. And don't forget to return my money. You both should pay me for sparing your lives. Don't let me down this time. We gotta go. Its one of the silliest things I've ever seen. What? Testify against Calabria. Nothing worse than a woman scorned. That's why I think women are like Kleenex, you know, once you use them, you throw them away. Not all of them. Please don't turn me in. I'll do whatever you want. I'll be your slave. lf you want you can keep doing this, I won't stop you, but it won't get you anywhere. Watch out, Boogie! Why do you do this to me, Boogie? I never hurt you, you know. Well, I never said that. Well then? There's only one person I wanna see happy. Who? Boogie, And d'you know the only thing that makes him happy? Money. Don't, Boogie, don't! Please, they'll kill me! That's not my problem. Something wrong? lf you don't shut your mouth you'll be in deep trouble, man. Please don't, Boogie! I saved you from the cops! Look, Marcia, there are two ways of doing this, but just the same results. Don't, Boogie, don't, please! Don't, please! Let me go! Please! Let me go! Bring her here. First the money. I'll take it. Please don't! Please, they're gonna kill me! Boogie... Boogie... Boogie... Fucking bitch! Sonny wants you to kill her. How much money's in the bag? What you asked. I won't do it. I agreed to turn her in. You got 500 grand with you? I got no change. Do you accept checks? Just cash. Save your money and pay for a good surgeon, it wouldn't do any harm to you. I mean it, you're as ugly as Inodoro Pereyra. Oh my! Don't walk out on me. Let go of me! Let me go! Don't please! Wait for me here. And nobody touches her till I come back. Damn! What the hell's wrong with me? Why does my stomach hurt? Is it stress? Hell what's this? Guilt? No, it's her fault. I didn't tell her to talk. Well, if she lost weight for what I said... but that has nothing to do. Okay, she saved me at the police station, but nobody asked her to. Marcia! I'll have to rescue you! Fucking bastard! Fucking bastard! You know how much I loved my raincoat! You won't get away this time! Where are you, chicken! Let's finish this once and for all! Of course. What? Damn it! Now were even. You're slow, Blackburn. At last we're alone. Would you like to dance? We'll work it out like men. One-on-one. What about one-on-one assistance at the asylum? Scared? Boogie is scared. You're not so tough after all. Go to hell! Noooooooooooo! Blackburn... you're too young to smoke. You worm! I wanted to kill you with my own hands! How much longer will we have to wait? Boogie! I knew you'd be back! Shut up before I regret it. The killing machine Victorino Lonco Peuln starts off... Here comes Victorino, he runs... Peuln... Zanato kicks the ball... here's Aguilar. He failed but Domingo managed to... What are we going to do now? I'll take you to court. Shall we get in time? We got less than an hour, it's a two-hour drive! ...and he insists. He wants to score. He's facing the goalkeeper... This is gonna be cool! I'm Lewis Reegan reporting from "War and Family". The trial that would mean the end of Sonny Calabria finishes today. Boogie, please. God Boogie! Don't Boogie! Boogie!!!!! What happened? AIexis jumped and killed him!!!! Damn it! Incredible play of visiting team. Think he was already dead. What a great game! Any news from Blackburn? Sonny, Blackburn has disappeared. What??? What about my money? Well... Boogie has your money. But we got Marcia, right? Eh... Sonny... Fucking asshole! Now what? Boogie... he took her away. Order! Order! You're gonna pay, you idiot! Its not my fault! Order! You know what, Boogie? You and I are so alike. We both are involved in this 'cause we feel ousted. Though there's a difference. I was ousted by someone uglier, obese and older. Mister prosecutor, where's your witness? She should be here, Your Honor. Sonny Calabria won't fall 'cause of a fucking traitor! I want all the police that work for us to find them! Watch out!!!!!!!!! It's 7:55. Marcia Frog, the key witness against Calabria, has not arrived yet. She only has 5 minutes left to testify against the Mafia boss. The tiny guy has a good start. Antonio overcomes Buonanotte. What a great pass! Damiani from behind faces the goalkeeper. He's not in offside. The goalkeeper fails to... Victorino kicks and goal, goal GOAL!!!! Its evident the prosecutor has no witness, without it there's no case against my client. I ask for a motion to dismiss all charges, Your Honor. Mr. Prosecutor, you pray that your witness... in the minute she has left. Finally the trial seems to end with a verdict in favor of Sonny Calabria. The prosecution didnt manage to get their key witness in time... so it's impossible to prove his guilt. My God! What's that? Right now a car chased by hundreds of cops is coming this way. It won't be able to get near the courthouse, demonstrators are blocking every access to where we are now. As the witness for the prosecution... has failed to arrive at the agreed time to testify, I as national judge decide... Ahhhhhhhhh Boogieeeeeeeee!! Nooooo!!! Noooooooooo!! Hold it! They're here! What's all this? Your Honor, I ask for a 10-minute recess. Please! You better be here in 10 minutes. This... This... this is unbelievable! Did you record that? Exclusive: Boogie! Hey, listen Boogie. Sure you didn't come to vote for the anti-tobacco bill. Why don't you shut your big mouth, jerk! He's burning. Lewis Reegan for "War and Family". Killed live. Thank God you're fine. The whole police have been looking for you. I'm alive thanks to Boogie. lf you want me to testify, you must withdraw all charges against him. All right. Need anything? Some "Fresh-Air". I... I... don't smoke. Unmanly, like every attorney. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do. Very good. You may sit down. Your witness. Can you tell us your name? Marcia Frog. Mrs. Frog, may I call you... Marcia? Yes, of course. Fine. Tell us please what is exactly your relationship with the defendant. I didn't take her all the way here to be killed now. The witness... Marcia! Kill Marcia! What's going on here? Guards! Boogie! Kill Boogie first! All of them! Kill all of them! Out! Get out of here, fucking useless attorney! Is there anyone I haven't killed yet? Here! Thanks. Listen, Boogie! After this maybe you'll need a good attorney. I'd give you a good discount. The only justice I believe in is my .44 Magnum. Fucking bastards!!!!! Here you have, rats! Where d' you think you're going? Marcia, please don't let him harm me. You know I've always loved you. Don't do this to me. We could be together again. Really? Yes, you and me together, Marcia. You've always been my favorite. Marcia... Oh, Sonny... Die you filthy worm, fucking retard, dirty! Cutie! Boogie... You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. It's been four months since I saw you for the last time. I dont know where you are. I didnt like to know nothing about you. But then I understood it was better that way, that you vanished into thin air. Maybe you're in some controversial place... doing what you like to do. I got something for you too.
