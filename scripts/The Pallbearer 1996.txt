I see you've been out of school for a year already. Well, okay, yes. But I think that's a little misleading. I look at this past year as a period of real growth for me... in terms of preparation for the future. - What are your goals? - Goals? You mean in terms of architecture? Where do you see yourself, let's say, five years from now? Oh. Well, um... It would be great to get this job so I can get out of my mom's house. No. Five years from now. I'd have to say... Well on my way, sir. That's where I see myself. I see a lot of room for me to grow here, and I don't want you to concern yourself with this past year. I'm the first to admit I had a little difficulty... just as far as forward momentum, but I've had a lot of job interviews recently, and I don't want to say anything, but I feel like I'm on the verge of a real breakthrough, I really do. And I think big things are gonna happen. Well, I'm certainly on your side, Tim. - Tom. - Tom. Tom Thompson. Hello? Tom! Tom! Tom! - Phone call. - Who is it? It's a girl. - Hey, what's this friggin' lock? - Not now. Hey! - Hello? - Is this Tom? Tom Thompson? - Who is this? - It's Ruth Abernathy, Bill's mom. Bill's... dead. - I have to talk to you. I'm, like, shaking. - Did you get the job? - Do you remember a guy named Bill Abernathy? - No. So you didn't get the job. This has nothing to do with the job. Come on, think. From high school? - Look, I don't remember him. Are you okay? - No? - Is that your Brooks Brothers? - I had to do some research at the firm. - You can't bowl in your Brooks Brothers. - Where's Brad? He's on the phone. He won't get off. Glass. Brad Glass. Right, from Brooklyn. No, no, no, United States. Sorry to wake you. What time there? He's been trying to reach that guy in Japan about that stupid dog breeding thing. - We have to talk to you. Hang up. - Miss Tsumaki. Miss Tsumaki! Six dollars a minute, this woman keeps putting me on hold. - Did you get the job? - Get off. I have to talk to you. - Is that your Brooks Brothers? - Do you remember a guy named Bill Abernathy? - Miss Tsumaki? - What happened at the interview? - They claim they're gonna call me. - Hello? Hello? Listen. Very important. I need feedback from husband about business proposal. - Can he call back? I have him call you back. - Chihuahua. - Okay. I call back. - Yeah, call back. - I call back. - Call back. - Okay. Bye-bye. Bye! - Good-bye. 'Bye. Listen, I'm trying to run a business here. That's a business call. I'm sorry to interrupt your business call, but Bill Abernathy is dead. Who's Bill Abernathy? Before I get the chance to tell this very mysterious-sounding woman... that I basically have no recollection of her son, - she just starts crying. - She cried? - Jesus, who is this woman? - I don't know. But there were these long stretches, nothing but crying, for like minutes. I feel really bad for the lady. She sounds like a nice, warm person. - So I guess I'm gonna need a suit. - For what? Hello? What have we been talking about? I'm gonna be a pallbearer. - What? - You didn't get out of it? Are you done laughing? This is my whole point. I'm in big trouble. - How could you tell her "yes"? - I told you, there was crying. How am I supposed to respond to that? Call her up. Tell her you got back trouble. It's no good. I am in, I am committed. I am just gonna have to do this one little thing for her. It starts off as one little thing, all of a sudden you're enmeshed in a situation. - This could be part of a whole scam operation. - What? One minute you're carrying this guy's coffin, the next you're lying in a ditch naked. - Is that suit black? - No, it's a charcoal gray weave with a chalk stripe. Why? - What are you, 40 regular? Scott, please. - No, no. I wear this suit to work. This is my main work suit. I have a problem here. I have to look presentable. This is a $600 suit. - Now I'm starting to see you for who you really are. - Come on. No, I'm serious. What if it were Brad lying in the coffin? Whoa! What are you talkin' about, "Brad"? Hey, all the shit you eat, your heart's a time bomb. That's nice. That's a nice thing. I've had enough. I gotta go. - What do you mean? We're not done here. - Hey, it's 10:30. So? It's Tuesday night. Can you believe him? It's 10:30 already? Come on, let's go. If you don't lend me the suit, Scott, I can't do it, I can't go. - I'll have to call her back. - That's good. You don't need this right now. - And don't forget the wedding shower. - Oh, yeah. I'm not going. - You're going. You're the best man. - No. How can he marry her? She's like an albatross around his neck. You don't understand. It's called a relationship. Oh, what? Cynthia's an albatross. Bring some wine, okay? You better come. - Cynthia. Hi. - Oh, hi! Oh, my God, you'll never believe who's coming. - How could you invite Jared Schneidman? - Just relax and you'll be fine. - Why? - Is that what you're wearing? Of course, it's what I'm wearing. We're here. - Wait. Who's coming? - Now, don't panic. - I'm not. - Good. I ran into her at D'Agostino's this morning. - Cynthia! - Who? - Hi! - Who? - I'll be right back. - I'm sorry. - Oh, Cynthia, come o... - There's a lot of single women here tonight. - Who's coming, Scott? - What are you talking about? Cynthia said someone is coming. It's not that Loretta person, is it? Because that did not work out. - Sweetheart... - Shut up! What the f... That is not good dip! Oh, gee. There she goes again. Do you see how she, like, spits? ...before you listen to me, Brad. - Sweetheart... - Shut up with the "sweetheart"! - I don't understand. You haven't the vaguest... Isn't that Julie DeMarco? - I have to borrow a shirt. - How many times do I have to tell you... - What are you doing? - That's Julie DeMarco out there. Don't you have any regular shirts? Like, just a shirt? What are you talking about? Like that. That's a good shirt. Don't you have any shirts like that? - Yeah, I'm wearing it. - Take it off. - What? - I have to borrow the shirt, Scott. - What is this obsessin with my clothes? - I was in love with her, okay? - So? - "So"? So I haven't seen her since high school. Imagine that she sees me and I'm wearing the same fuckin' shirt! Look, I just got this shirt. - Guys. - He wants to borrow my shirt now. Whatever. We gotta do something about the dip. Lauren's having a frigging conniption out there. Did you leave your answering machine on? I gave Tsumaki the phone number. I got a line on a couple of prize-winning dogs. - What's wrong with the dip? - Lauren's sisters are all lactose-intolerant. "Lactose"? Don't marry her, Brad. - Lauren... - He doesn't care. Julie, Julie. Is it too much to ask that I could have one dip for me and my sisters to enjoy? - What about salsa? - Salsa! I love... I love salsa. T... Tom! You remember Julie DeMarco. She's back in Brooklyn. Oh! Hi, sure, yes. Didn't you move away senior year? - Yeah, Long Island. - Her father made a killing in real estate. Julie's right. Salsa, guacamole. It is so obvious. You know what? I think I have some avocado in the kitchen. - Let's take a look. - I just want to tell you one thing. - Did you ever think salsa or guacamole? - Okay. So, you... Wow. You look, uh, really... Oh, God. Well, that's really... Hey, Mary Lou! God! Jared Schneidman? I-I know. D-Do you know he's engaged? He is not! Oh, my God! - Everybody's getting married. - I know! It's like a virus or something. I know. I mean, I was, you know, supposed to, but... - Oh. - You know, it didn't work out. But, yeah... But I thought for sure you would have been snatched up by now. Oh... So you remember me? Tom! What, are you kidding? So you think I would have been snatched up, huh? Well, you know, a lot of giris were, uh, after you. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes! - What about that girl? - Who? Oh, you know, uh, Shelly. Shelly What's-Her-Name. She loved you. - I have no idea who you're talking about. - Yes, you do. Remember, you guys did that play, that musical together? - Musical? No, I don't... - Yeah, you were great. You had a great voice. I don't... sing. What do you mean? I'm Tom Thompson. We were in band together. Oh. - You okay? - Please, I'm fine. This is good. It's time you let go of Julie DeMarco, just move past her. So I've decided. You should ask Julie DeMarco out for coffee. She's one of the sweetest people I have ever, ever known. Yeah, Tom, did you see those legs? Forget about it. - You were staring at her legs? - No, not for me, for Tom. - I can't believe you. - What? You should be staring at my legs. I've been staring at your legs for nine years. What are you saying? You're tired of my legs? No, Cynthia, I'm agreeing with you. I'm saying that Tom should ask Julie DeMarco out for coffee. - Don't you think he should? - Yes! Are you okay? Please, I'm fine. How was the party? It was okay. Gonna see your father on Sunday? I don't know, Ma. Anything new? Good night, Ma. See ya tomorrow. Ohh. Tom. I got in touch with Jimmy Gold. He's coming down from Boston. And then the cousins from Jersey. Maybe, you know, a friend from the gym. We might be one or two short on the pallbearers. Mrs. Abernathy, I am really sorry. I wish there was something I could do to help you out. I know how you feel. You do? - I'm giving the eulogy. - What? - Ruth Abernathy came to my house. - Jesus, you didn't get out of it? - You're getting enmeshed. - Are you having a thing? Tom, don't get upset. Brad and Lauren just stopped by. - It's not like a thing thing. - Is that lasagna? - I can't believe you people. It's just like a conspiracy. - No, it's not! - If you must know, this was my idea. - Oh, your idea. - We're two couples having dinner. - I need to be a couple now. - Not everything's about you, Tom. - That's right. It's all about you... and your sisters and all your dietary restrictions. All right, that's it! I've had your shit... - Let's go. I'm ready for you now. - Relax. - Get you a drink, Tom? - Yes, you can, Cynthia. - And some lasagna. Thank you. - Take it easy. I don't know. What about the chess club? Can't we do anything with the chess club? It should be personal. I mean, you loved the guy. - I did not love the guy. - Maybe you traveled together. Yeah, excellent! Scott, read that back. Okay. "Chess. You loved him. Traveled together." - Okay. We are on our way. - You traveled together playing chess. - Yes! Yes! - Through China. You played chess in China and then you fell in love. See, that doesn't help. You don't know this Ruth Abernathy person. She means business. - So, Scott, you're coming with me, right? - What, to the funeral? No. - Scott! How about giving a little moral support? - Yeah, Scott, I need some moral support. - Don't worry. - I'll support you, Tom. - Just Scott. - Hi. How are you? - It's Julie DeMarco. What, she just comes over now? Hi. I'm sorry I missed the lasagna, but I got... Anyway. Here are the magazines we were talking about. - So. What's going on? - We're writing a eulogy. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't worry. We didn't know the guy. You guys are going to someone's funeral who you don't know? - Actually, they're not going. I'm going. - Scott and I are going. - Why don't you come too? - You're inviting me to a funeral? - Yes! It's not like it's a real funeral. - It is! It's a funeral. - If she's going, I'm allowed to go. - She is not going. - Typical bullshit. - Tom! - It's okay. Obviously, Tom does not want me to go to this funeral thing and that's fine. - I have nothing against you going personally... - All right, we're all going. No, no, no. Only if it's okay with Tom. - Tom, is it okay? - Is it okay, Tom? Come on. - That's the dead guy's mother? - Uh-huh. Jesus. Thank you. Excuse me. My condolences. Who will perform the eulogy? The tall young man with the dark suit and hair. Tom Thompson. Thank you so much. Ring any bells? No. Mr. Thompson, if you would please, sir. Good luck. Who is Bill Abernathy? This is not an easy question to answer. I could spend countless hours recounting my personal experiences... with Bill. The chess club. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Instead I ask, who is the real Bill Abernathy? What is the single... elusive, intangible, inner quality... that makes... made... Bill... Shh. Bill. Well, folks, I don't... I don't have that answer. Who really does? Shh. Pull ahead. - I got it. - All right. Here we go. - So, you guys, I don't think this is funny, all right? - We don't think it's funny. - We weren't laughing. - Yes, you were. I can't, you know... - That was a sneeze. - I don't think it's funny. I just don't understand. We weren't laughing. I'll see you all later. I don't feel like staying. I'm very... I'm gonna go. Julie! Julie! - Ohh! - Come right this way, please. - Julie! Where are you goin'? - Come on, I'm losing him! What are you doing? - Julie! - Come on! Hey, hey, wait! Where... Where are you going? - What are you doing? - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. This isn't funny. - I know. I felt terrible. So, you remember him? - What? - I saw you in the chapel. You were crying. Hey, buddy, are you kidding with this? Do you mind? We're about to bury this guy. This is a person. This is a person's life. I don't remember him. - Oh. - Hey, what's goin' on over there? It was just so, so sad. I don't know what the hell he's doing. - Do you wanna get some coffee? - Unbelievable. - He's pickin' up chicks. - Coffee? Yeah. If you wouldn't mind. - Yeah, all right. Why don't you call me? - C-Call you? - Get him off. - All right, let's go. - Whoa! - All right, all right. Come on, back it up. I never should've asked you to be a pallbearer. It was too much for you. - There's a will. - What? You're in the will. All the way in. Hello? - Julie, hi. - Hi. - Hi, it's Tom Thompson. - Oh. Tom. - Hi. How are you? - I'm fine. So listen, um, I was calling because we've talked about din... um... - Uh... - What did we talk about? - Did we, at the funeral, talk about doing this, uh... - Right, right. - The coffee thing. - Yes! - Um, listen, I was thinking... - Yeah? What if Scott and Cynthia come along? - Scott and Cynthia? - Yeah. - Oh, you mean like a, uh... - Yeah, you know, like the four of us. - Tom! - 'Cause I'm seeing Cynthia on Tuesday anyway. - Tu... On Tuesday? - Tom! - Who was that? - Huh? Oh, it's, uh... it's ju... - This crazy woman... Jesus, this neighborhood is... Hey, lady, you wanna keep it down? I am on the phone here! Are you on the phone? - Hello. - Hello? - Hello? Who is this? Hello? Jesus. Tom? Oh, my God. Tom? Uh, hel... ...Ulie? - H-Hello? - Julie? Julie? - Hi! Hi! Wh... Well, that was weir... What was that? lt... Did... D- Did you... That was really creepy. - She just kept saying "hello." Did you hear her? - No. Didn't you hear me? - Y... No. - No? I w... Well, I was calling you. Were you trying to contact me? Uh, y-y-yeah. I ke... I kept saying "Julie." Didn't... It must've been a weird party line thing. - That has never happened before. - Huh. So listen, Tuesday is bowling night. - Oh. - Uh, how about Thursday? Great. Oh, no, I- I can't take his car. Look at this mess. Mrs. Abernathy. - Take it. He wanted you to have it. - No, really, I can't. I gotta get it out of here. Please. Twenty-five-year-old kid makes out a will. I should've known right then. I brought you some, uh... nut clusters. They're my favorite. Oh, Tom. I'm sorry about the funeral. So... how are you doing? I'm fine, I'm... I'm gonna be. Thank you. Maybe I should just have them take it all away. - Oh, here, here. Let me help you with that. - Thanks. I gotta get it all out of here if I'm gonna sell this place. Oh, you're gonna sell the house? Yeah. You know, maybe it's too big for one person. Too quiet. I mean, it's like I have the TV on all the time now. Thank you. It's very nice to have someone to help out around here. Oh, sure. Who knows? You know, I was thinking, maybe, of going to one of those computer schools. Oh, yeah, computers. That's good. You think so? I'm gonna have to go through Bill's stuff in his room. - I wish I could help you out. - Oh, no, no. I mean, it's just that I'm... I'm very busy. - I mean, I got a job interview. - Oh, a job interview. Yeah. Actually it's a second interview. I bet you get it. Thank you. I hope so. I'm a little worried. Do you mind if I make a suggestion? - Sure. - Why don't you try pushing your hair back over your forehead. You know, like the other afternoon. Like... Yeah, like that. Just... You don't let 'em see your face. You're a good-looking man. Well, maybe I'll let you know how the interview goes. I mean, if you're interested. - Sure. If you have enough time, you can drop by. - Yeah, if I have the time. - Whoa! My God, look at you. - He's turned a corner. Oh, very important. I sort of mentioned that I live on my own, okay? - So just don't blow it. - You lied to her? - No, she seemed to have a thing about it. - So what are we supposed to say? - Oh, this is it! - What are we supposed to do at the end? - Cynthia and I are going for cocktails? - A late movie. - You guys say you have plans to see a late movie, then just go. - How are we getting home? Deal with it. I need the car. He's gotta drive her home. That's the whole point. Could you give me an opening for the story about Brad and the oranges? - Tom, just be yourself. - Yeah, you're right. - Scott, you set me up with the orange story. - You got it. Wait, wait, wait. Wh... What was it? - Uh, "Mean To Me," maybe? - No, no! - Louis Armstrong did a great versin of it too. - Oh! Oh, oh, oh. Uh... It goes: # Dah dah-dah dah-dah # # Dah dah-dah dah-dah Dah dah-dah dah-dah # - # Dah dah-dah dah-dah... # - # If I only had a brain # Tom, you've heard of Django Reinhardt, right? - No, Scott. - Oh, my God. He is so amazing. - He only had three fingers. - Really? - Yeah. - Mmm. That's too bad. So, anyway... Julie, did you know Tom's got a second interview tomorrow? Oh! That's great. - Yeah, well... - "I Surrender, Dear." - You what, honey? - # Dah-dah, dah-dah # # Dah-dah, dah-dah # # I surrender, dear ## I love that song. Oh, you know what? I think that's on Decca. I've seen it in the bins. - What, you have that record? - Yeah. I need that record desperately! - Yeah, so they seemed to really like my portfolio. - What? Oh, 'cause... Oh! That's so exciting, Tom. - Yeah, you should really see Tom's stuff. It's so great. - Oh, go on. Well, it's a really good firm and they seem to have room to grow. And you can maybe finally move out of your mom's house. Didn't you have... What was that, that story about Brad and oranges? Didn't you have a story about Brad and oranges? No, Scott. Whoa, Cynthia and I have to, uh... we have to go get some cocktails. Mmm. I- I-I cannot believe you. I'm sorry. That thing about your mother just slipped out. No, the whole evening. What were those topics? - You were supposed to feed me openings so I could jump in with the zingers. - I was. - You weren't zinging. - Oh, bullshit! - How am I supposed to zing on, what, "jingle-jangle"? - Django Reinhardt! Look, I'm sorry. She told me she was working in this record store. - You told me to keep things flowing. - Oh, flowing. Yes, flo... You know, you're making me sick, Scott. - You still have the drive home. - The drive home? The drive home is useless, you know. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. You know, we really didn't get much of a chance to talk tonight. I wanted to tell you something. I remember you. We shared a music stand, didn't we? Yeah. I used to talk to you about that guy I went out with... Kenny. That's right. Anyway... What I remember is... you were a really nice guy. Julie. - Oww! Oh, shit. - Ooh! I am so... Ohh. Okay. - Oh, my God. - I should've warned you I was going in. - Oh, God. - Are... Are you... No, you know, it's my fault. I just... I do this, you know. L... I give out the wrong signals. Oh. L... I'm re... I'm really sorry, Tom. I'm going away. You're going away? - It's sort of a... sort of a long story. - But you just moved back. Well, I'm not really here. It's, like, a temporary arrangement until I'm ready to go. I needed a place to stay and my dad, you know, owns the building and I just... I mean, if I wasn't going away... Well, I'm very sorry. I mean, your work is very strong. I fought for you. But the partners felt, and I had to agree with them, you just don't fulfill our needs at this time. I want to thank you for coming in. I didn't get the job. I'll get the boxes. He loved the Mets. Thank you for doing this. I got something you might want. Come here. There might be one or two of you in there. You can take one. It's hard to believe. - You're a beautiful boy. - Oh, no, no. - Yes, you are. - Well, thank you, Ruth. Thank you. Bill Senior, on the other hand, he had to get by on his wits. No chin. I met him one night at this party at Aunt Lucille's. I was 16. I fell for him like that. Next day he left for Vietnam. Two years. So... what, you just waited for him? Oh, sure. - I mean, there were plenty of other suitors. - I'm sure. But Bill Senior, you know, he just... tickled my fancy. Whew, and those letters he wrote. Holy cow. I would've waited a few lifetimes. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's that easy. I had the dial set a little thin. - Press the button. And now you'll feed everything down to the last piece. It's a perfect result! - That's pretty good! - Every time. - It's beautiful. - It's perfection in slicing. - Please, Tom. - Ruth, I'd really rather not. I need you to do this. He never talked to me about things like this. It's... It's important to me. Please. What do you want to know? Giris. Well, I think there was one girl Bill liked. Really? What was her name? - Julie. - Julie. - Was she pretty? - Oh, yeah. He did everything he could, but he just couldn't stop thinking about her. Even when he tried really hard not to. She haunted him. She haunted him. So what happened? Well, she told him she was planning on going away, but I don't know. He couldn't let her go. I mean, he'd been in love with her for so long. And I guess no one tickled his fancy the way she did. So, this Julie... Do you think that's the reason he... No, Ruth. I knew we shouldn't have gotten into this. - Could be the reason, you know. - Ruth, no. - Did she go to Yale? - What? There were all these toll receipts in the car. New Haven. Did she go to Yale? She didn't go to Y... No, Ru... It... I don't think it had anything to do with her. I know it didn't. Hello? Tom? It's Julie. Hi, Julie... - Julie? - Can I come over? I have to talk to you. - Come over here? - Yeah. I'm in the neighborhood. I'm coming, okay? - What are you doing? - Someone's coming over. A girl. Don't make a big deal... Is that what you're wearing? It's my friggin' house! Okay, try not to say "friggin'," don't call me "Tom-Tom"... and no stories about me doing magic. - Hey. - Hi. - What's going on? - Nothing. - So, could I come in, or... - Oh, sure. - Julie, this is my mom. - Oh, hi. I'm Tom's mom. How are you? Tom-Tom comes out in his funny little hat and cape... and he has a little magic wand. I'm telling you, he was the cutest thing you ever saw! - I got a picture. - Mom, no pictures. - Oh, wait, no! I got one in... - Mom! I'm goin' in the kitchen now. Oy. It was really nice meeting you. Oh, it was nice meeting you too. - I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry. It's just, this thing happened and I didn't know who else to turn to. Well, what's... what's up? Scott came to see me last night. He did? What, at work? - Yeah. - How is Scott? He made a pass at me. Oh, my... Wh... I can't believe he did this! What in... What... I can't believe it! How could he kiss you like that when he's supposed to be married? - How do you know he kissed me? - How do l... How's that? I said "pass," I didn't say "kiss." - Oh, my God! Did he tell you this? - No. I'm sorry. - I hear "pass," I move right to "kiss." - Well, he did kiss me. Bastard! What is he thinking? I don't know what to do. Do I tell Cynthia? Do I not tell her? Oh, you... you... you tell her. This is a moral issue. Unfortunately, Scott is an adulterer and that is something Cynthia should know. Okay, okay, but what if it's not all Scott's fault, all right? - What if it's partly my fault? - What do you mean? I'm just saying, he shows up out of nowhere looking for a record? I should've seen it coming. I just... I let things get out of control. - The same thing happened with Jed. - Jed? One minute we're having this casual conversation... "Maybe we should live together." The next thing I know, I'm getting married. - This is the guy you were gonna marry. - Yeah. I mean, I cared about him, you know, and he really wanted to get married. But I guess I wasn't sure, and I should've told him that at the very beginning. I mean, before that whole marriage thing got started. Have you ever not told someone something that you should've told them, but you were afraid to, so you didn't, and then it turned into a whole complicated thing... that you never should've gotten into in the first place? You kids want some Bosco? Mom! No! Oh. I love Bosco. This is why you never got first chair. - What? - In band. Mr. Busto wanted you to challenge Cliff Young for first chair, but you wouldn't do it. Oh, my God. - I forgot about Cliff Young. - You didn't want to hurt his feelings. - Well, he loved his solos. - Yeah, but you were better than he was. - No. - You were. I'll, I'll give Cliff Young his trills, but you had it all over him in the upper register. How do you remember all this? I have a really good memory. Well, I guess I was always screwed up. No, you were just worried about other people's feelings. Yeah, but the thing is, you spend your life worrying about how other people feel, you sort of lose track, you know, of how you feel. Does this have anything to do with you going away? Sort of. My plan... is to save up, buy a car, pack all the things I really care about... and just drive off on my own for, like, a year. Because I never really been on my own. You know? Y- You've got a thing. On my mouth? Listen, um, there's this thing tonight at St. John the Divine. I got the tickets for me and, you know, Jed. - It's this guy Gorczcki. - Hockey? A composer. I know. So, uh, do you, you know... do you want to go with me? Yes. - How could you do this to me? - What? It's 2:30. Where the hell have you been? - I really need to talk to you. Can we please just go inside? - They're waiting for us. - Who? - Weren't you even listening to me the other night? Of course I was listening to you. What did you say? Aunt Lucille's. The pool party. Did you even remember to bring your trunks? Oh, Jesus. Let's go. I packed some of Bill's. Come on! # Papa loves mambo # # Mama loves mambo # # Look at him sway with it Gettin' so gay with it # - # Shoutin' "ole" with it now # - Hey! # Papa loves mambo # Ohh! Do you remember me? - Uh... - Of course you don't. You were this high. Boys, you remember Tom from the funeral? Ruth told me everything you've been doing. She did? I can't tell you how wonderful you are, helping my sister-in-law through this time. Oh, there she is. Ohh! Oh, you look great! You're making me cry. - Oh, well... - You are so strong. I owe it all to Tom. I mean, he was there for me, you know. - When I needed someone, he was there. - Tom. # Feelin' that zing again, wow # - # Papa loves mambo # - # Papa loves mambo # # Mama loves mambo ## Julie, hi. It's, it's me, Tom. No, everything's fine. Listen, what time did you say the concert was? No, I can make it, um... It's just, I had this horrible family thing I couldn't get out of. Okay, great. No, I'm still here. Okay. Bye. # Come a little bit closer # - # Hear what I have to say # - So, did you like it? It was great. - It was nothing like anything we ever played in band though. Weren't all these recalled? No. That was the, uh, Pinto. - I don't think we're gonna make it. - Are you kidding me? This... This thing's running like a top. - # Oooh # - # But there's a full moon risin' # I'm sure it just needs a minor adjustment. Tom? - Hmm? - Who's Ruth? Ruth? You know, Ruth. Under the seat, I found "Ruth." Oh, that's Ruth Abernathy's. Bill's mom. I've been sort of spending some time with her. You know, she's been going through a, a difficult period. Are you kidding me? What do you mean? That is so nice of you. Oh. No, i-it really isn't. Yes, it is. You don't even remember that guy. That is so nice of you. No, it... it really isn't. # Because I'm still in love with you # # I wanna see you dance again # # Because I'm still in love with you # # On this harvest moon ## - That's your room? - What? Yeah. I tried to get that off. It's, like, welded to the door. Can I see? Um, my mom doesn't really like me to drive her car. We really shouldn't dally. W- We're getting into a dangerous zone here. You wait here, okay? Oh, shit. - Oh, Julie. Julie... - Oh, my God. - I know. I should probably get rid of the bunk bed, huh? - Oh! I'm sorry. - Shh! Ohh. - Do you still play? - Not really? Do you? No. I lost mine. Oh. - I remember these. - Yeah. Shh! Oh! Sorry. These were great. What happened to these? They, they killed a lot of people. Um, I was cleaning out my closet... that's why that's out. - Oh, my God. - What? My hair. I look so bizarre. No. No, you didn't. Look at that dress. What was I thinking? You look beautiful. For the last seven years I've been wishing I'd danced with you. What? Oh, uh, it was the... homecoming dance. - You and me, we went to a dance? - Oh, not together. But it was during one of those weeks that you and Kenny were broken up. We were talking on the bleachers... and "Rock Lobster" started playing... and you said "I love this song," which I kinda took as a signal... that you wanted to dance. But... I didn't ask you. - Why not? - 'Cause I can't dance. - Tom. - What? - I'm goin' in. - You're... Hi. - Oww. - Oh. Oh. Oh! Hello? So, how was the concert? - Hey. Hey, Ruth. - Is there something you want to tell me, Tom? - Hello? - Mom, I'm on the phone here. - Who's calling so late? - Mom, please. Well, is somebody in there with you? I heard somebody come in with you. Is there a girl in there? - Mom, I am on the phone! - Jesus. Are you still there? I'm here. I- I found your bracelet. Is she there? She's there, isn't she? Are you gonna screw me, Tom? Are you gonna screw me over? You are, aren't you? You're gonna screw me over. You did what? Don't make a big deal out of this. You had sex with the dead guy's mother? That lady from the funeral? - The lady from the funeral. All right, Brad? - Did you tell Scott? - I'm not talking to Scott. - What do you mean? - Scott's an asshole. - What are you talkin' about? - Brad! - What's going on here? Who are you these days? - The point is, what am I gonna do about Ruth Abernathy? - What are you gonna do? - You're gonna get out of there. What are you, nuts? - This is no good. - Brad! - Okay. Okay. We have to wrap this up. Wrap it up? We're nowhere, okay? I'm in a dilemma, Brad. Look. - What's that? - That's her charm bracelet. - The dead guy's mother? - Ruth Abernathy. - Her name is Ruth. - Okay. Okay. Take that friggin' bracelet and drop it in the mail. You understand? Write her a little love poem and get rid of it, 'cause you're lost. What are you saying? Just drop it in the mail? That's your big solution? - Get in here, Brad! - Okay! - I gotta go. That's three calls. I gotta go. - Brad... Listen, that's all I got, all right? Mail it. Clean break. Tom. Look, it's good about you and Julie. Don't worry about it. Thanks, Brad. It's my birthday. I'm having brunch with my parents on Sunday to celebrate. That'll be nice. Mmm. It'll be the first time I've seen them since I left Jed. Mmm. Would you go with me? To meet your parents? Yeah. You want me to meet your parents? Yeah. Is $15 enough? Ma, the name of this place is Chanterelle. That's $50 right there. I'll get you another $5. Tom? Is that for you, Tom? - Hello. - Is Tom here? Can you tell me what this is regarding? You know where he went? Say something. - Honey, could we just eat first before we... - Tom. - Hi. - Hi. Hello. Hi. Tom, this is my father Philip. - It's really great to meet you, sir. - I don't understand. - And, uh, - Excuse me, sir. This is my mom Suzanne. - Oh. Good morning. - Hello. Are you eating here too? Yes, Tom... Tom, uh, is going to be joining us. - I thought we were here to talk. - Please, honey, don't get upset. - I am upset. - Oh. Um... Uh, look, look. This is my birthday, okay? Tom is my guest. All right? Okay? I'm sorry. This is rude. I just don't understand. Could you tell me what he's doing here? My daughter walks out just before her wedding. I've barely heard from her in two months. I want to know what's going on. - Well, that's understandable. - Why is he talking? - Are you sleeping with her? Is that what this is? - Dad! - Philip. - All right, I'll get to the point. This trip... we've all talked about it, your mother and I and Grandma, and we all agree... we don't understand it. Sweetheart, listen, a little vacation is a great idea. Why would you want to waste a year of your life? Look, I don't want a vacation, all right? I'm... I'm lost, okay? I'm completely... lost. I don't know what I'm doing with my life, and I need to take this trip. It's important, okay? I mean, Tom understands, you know. I feel like he's the only person who understands what I'm doing. That's sort of the reason I wanted him here. Tom, maybe you could explain it to us. Well, Mrs. DeMarco, Mr. DeMarco, um, I can understand... how you might not want Julie to go away right now. Uh, the truth is, it probably has nothing to do with this trip. It's probably because you just don't want her to leave. But... But I just think that Julie feels... Don't go, Julie. - What? - I don't want you to go. I mean, a year? - I thought we were doing something here. - Tom, what are you saying? - I told you this was a temporary thing. I said that. - I know. I've never felt like this in my whole life, Julie. I feel like we... I mean, I feel like... I really know you. Don't you? I mean, is it just me? - Excuse me, ma'am. - There you are! - Who is this? - Oh, my God! - Mrs. Abernathy? - I wanna talk to you. - Ruth, this is not a good time. - We're having a brunch here. - We're going outside. - This is the way you say good-bye? - It was just for the sex, wasn't it? - Jesus, Ruth. - He's sleeping with everybody. Have you been tested? - What is she talking about? And what's this lousy poem? Is this supposed to mean something to me? - You wrote her a poem? - No. Let's go. - Sex, sex, sex. You're a horrible young man. - Julie... - Julie? - Oh, is this her? - Yes. - This is Julie, and we're going. - Tell her, Tom. - Tell her what you did to your best friend's mother! - Oh, my God. Tom! He wasn't my best friend. - Julie. - What are you talking about? - Julie. - Tom! Look, Ruth, I don't even remember Bill. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. # She's a super freak Super freak # # She's super freaky Yeow # # Everybody sing # # Super freak Super freak # # She's a very special girl # - # From her head down to her tail # - Hey!

We need to give him a little mouth-to-mouth. - Stop kidding, all right? - Hey, what's the matter, man? It's my last Tuesday! - I'm gettin' married! I'm happy. I'm happy. - I know! I am too! I'm just not in the mood, all right? I forgot. You don't like bachelor parties. You only get turned on at funerals. - All right, very funny. - Nurse, please! You talk to him. - No. I'm outta here. I'm leaving. - Where are you going? - Brad, get off! - # That girl's a super freak # - # I really like to taste her # - # Every time we meet # - Lauren is right about you. - # She's all right, she's all right # - I defended you. - # The girl's all right # - # With me # - I said you'd come through in the end, but she's right.

'Cause he's a better best man. - # She's super freaky # Don't marry her, Brad. - # Temptations, sing # - Hey. Lauren's an albatross around your neck, Brad.

Let him go. Are you okay? Tom... - Get off me! - Hey, asshole! - Get out of my party! Get out of here! - I saw you with her, Scott. No one wants you here! Get out! Get off of me, Joey! I don't want him here! You're not allowed! - What happened? - Scott! - Tom? - Yeah, Mom? Scott's here. So, what are you doing in here? New carburetor. Just checking the idle. So, Brad's a little upset. Tried talking to him, but... Doesn't look like you're gonna be the best man. Well, you'd make a better best man anyway, wouldn't you, Scott? Cynthia kicked me out. We had this little fight and it... I don't even know what it was about. Look, Tom, I'm really sorry. I messed up. Tasha Cortina. - Oh. Tasha Cortina. - Yeah. But she had that lip thing. - What lip thing? - You know, that little scar. - No, I liked that scar. It was sexy. - For me, it ruined everything. - Oh, you're too critical. - Yeah. - Boys? - Ma! We're talk... I can't believe you just walk in here. I'm 25 years old. This is why I need the lock. - I just wanted to know if you want some ice cream. - A little. Seventh grade. Nancy Weinberg. Oh, she liked me. - She did not like you. - She did. She had this very serious thing, like an obsessin. No, don't you remember Angela Mineri? Angela Mineri told you Nancy Weinberg had this big crush on you. - You went up to Nancy in front of everybody... - Oh, no. Shit. - And she laughed in your face. - Yeah, that's right. - It was the other Tom. She had a crush on him. - What other Tom? The other Tom. Wait, what are you saying? - Oh, Jesus. - Mr. Jellison's class. - In eighth grade. - He got a 58 in unit one algebra... and then he started crying. Whatever happened to that guy? - He went to a different high school... Madison. - How do you know? 'Cause Nancy Weinberg kept on going out with him all through high school. Whatever happened to that guy? I don't know. I heard that Nancy Weinberg is in grad school at Yale. Yale. Yale. - Tom, what are you doing? You're going now? - I gotta go! I've been driving all night. I have to tell you something. Can I come in? Ruth, please. You lied to me. You used my son... the memory of my son. That was all I had left. How could you do that? I remember when my third-grade teacher cut her finger on a paper cutter... and had to go home. I remember when Bruce Feinbaum tripped Matthew Ellison... during the fire drill... An-and everyone laughed. L... I have a really good memory, Ruth, but... no matter how hard I wracked my brain, I couldn't remember your son. The fact that I could... forget him like that, that his life could... leave so little impressin on me, that really scared me. I mean, it... It terrified me. Because I wouldn't want to be forgotten. I- I'm sorry. Sh-Should I just keep waiting in the car? No, it's okay. R- Ruth. Um... This is Tom Thompson. Hi, Mrs. Abernathy. He, uh, wanted you to have his car. Oh, no. No. No. L... It'd be too sad. Look, I have a car. Well, l... I did put some money into it. You keep it. Yeah? So, uh, you guys were close? Not really. We just knew each other. It's so hard to let him go. I don't know. I mean, I needed someone. I needed someone too. # Let the river # # Rock you like a cradle # # Climb to the treetops # # Child, if you're able # # Let your hands tie a knot # - # Across the table # - May He lift His countenance upon you... - and grant you His most precious gift... - # Come # - # And touch the things you cannot feel # - and His blessings of peace. - Amen. - Amen. # And close your fingertips # # And fly where I can't hold you # Mazel tov! # Let the sun rain fall # # And let the blue clouds enfold you # # And maybe you can sing to me # # The words I just told you # # With all the things your feelings were facing # # Then don't mind me # # 'Cause I ain't nothin' # # But a dream # # The mockingbird sings each different song # # Each song has wings # # They won't stay long # # Do those who hear # # Think he's doing wrong # # While the church bell # # Tolls its one-note song # # And the school bell # # Is tinkling to the throng # # Come here # # Where your ears cannot hear # # And close your ears # # Child, and listen to what I'll tell you # # Follow in the darkest night # # The sounds that may impel you # # And the song that I am singing # # May disturb or serve to quell you # # If all the sound you're hearing is what they sing # # Then don't mind me # # 'Cause I ain't nothin' # # But a dream # # Mm-mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm ## Julie.

Belated. Please. Please. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The band is gonna take a short break now, but we'll be back a little later. I don't understand. It has a new carburetor, if that's what you're worried about. Tom. Uh, I can't take your car. The tires are good for another 10,000 miles, so, you know, that should take you... wherever you wanna go. It's a really good car. Please take it. I'll be your deejay this evening spinning tunes.

I'm just saying, this is getting heavier and heavier. What happens when Julie comes back? You'll have to move again? - No, she gave it to me. They're letting me rent it. You wanna be careful with my bunk bed? You wanna complain, you pay. So, is that, uh, the last of it? That's everything. Don't worry.
