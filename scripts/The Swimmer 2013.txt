It'll fall out soon. Finish your eggs. Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to. Just slipped out of my hand. Is that a Lego speed? - It's a mining truck. - Oh, nice. I've the... Shut up, bum fluff! So, Iron Man, I'm going to the pool this arvo. What about you, little pussy? Bitten by a reef shark. You're pathetic. And, you, stop ringing that freaking bell, or I'm gonna smash it! Come on move your ass, crumbum, I'm hungry. Sammy, I'm going to the store to get some DVDs. Wanna come? - Daddy, I want to see Nemo! - Okay, princess. Now go inside and see your mum. She's waiting for you. Sammy, come on, let's go. We could get... Yeah. Don't steal it. - It's okay. - Leave it. Good one. What are you looking at, squirt? Hey, I'm talking to you. Are you deaf? You're a real weirdo, you know that, kid? Forget about what you saw. Come on, let's go. Oh, no! Ellie! What did you do? Come on. Come here. Come up. Are you okay, Sam? Stop that DVD, okay? I don't know why your dad let you watch that. Sammy, where are your track pants? Sammy? Sam? Sammy? Sammy, are you in the bath? Sam! I'm not sure what to do, Carl. About what? I'm worried about Sam. I think he's still afraid of what happened. Afraid? Maybe if you stop babying him. I was thinking maybe we should talk to someone about it. We don't need to talk to anyone, Alice, the kid's fine. Fine? That's right. It's always so easy for you, isn't it, Carl? What's easy? Ever since the accident, you've been overprotecting him. Next week, he can go back to swimming lessons. He's been away too long. 'Cause that's all you care about, isn't it? Look, tomorrow we'll go to the beach, all together. You'll see it's all in your head. I have work tomorrow, Carl. - And it's not all in my head. - All right. We'll go, and you can join us after. Hey, Sammy, you wanna go for a swim? Water's too cold now. Daddy, I'm thirsty. Oh, you're thirsty, princess? What do you want to drink? I want a creaming soda! Okay, how about you, Sammy? - I'll have a lemonade. - Okay. A soda and a lemonade coming right up. Sammy, stay here with your sister. Yep, yep, Daddy long-legs! Does your scar hurt? What do you wanna make? A castle for the littlest princesses in the world. Look who turned up at the beach. Very brave! You know, you're really mean. The midget has spoken! Oh, big brother's upset now! Looks like you can still float. Wanna play a game? Another time. You wouldn't want me to take it up with your weirdo sister when you're not around, would you? You better leave my sister alone. Then play. It's easy. All you do... You put your hand on the board. I say three, two, one, and we go under. The first one to come up loses. Okay? Ready? Three, two, one. Go! Guys, what is that? Shark! Get out! Get out! Ellie! What's the matter? What's the matter? Where's your brother? Sam! Sammy! Jay! - Jay! - Sammy! Sam! Sam! What happened? Jay! +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ + | T | h | e | | D | e | a | f | | B | o | y | s | | F | o | r | | B | o | y | s | | G | r | o | u | p | + +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ E N J O Y this SRT SUBTITLE R e l e a s e The Swimmer (2013) English for hearing-impaired.srt and The Swimmer (2013) English.srt FPS: 24.000 With special thanks to: "Superbad" +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ + | T | h | e | | D | e | a | f | | B | o | y | s | | F | o | r | | B | o | y | s | | G | r | o | u | p | + +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 1) ALL DVD's to be subtitled. 2) ALL VIDEO GAMES to be subtitled. 3) ALL videos/DVD's used in lessons at school to be subtitled. / / / ) ( / ) ( / ) / ( /) (- /( / (- ( / / /() () (/ ) / () / /() () (/ ) () / () (/ /) - | Africa | | Asia | | Australia | | Europe | | North America | | South America | - / +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ + A big Thank You to EVERYBODY + + involved in making [closed capture] srt files and supporting us + +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
