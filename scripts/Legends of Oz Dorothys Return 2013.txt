You can count now, can you? Oh, boy. Sounds like somebody needs an oil change. What'd you do? Forget to prime your pump? Oh, very brave. I think that crown has gone to your head. - Can it, rust bucket! - Oh, how dare you! I'll show you how! Come on, funnel-head! Let's go! Clank, clank, clank! Anybody in here? Oh, yeah. That just happened. Break it up, you two knuckleheads. We're in a grave situation here! - Ah, sorry. - Yeah. - I-I guess we're all a little on edge, huh? - Copy that. But with all of Oz at risk, I need you two to stand guard... while I try to contact Dorothy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! "Contact Dorothy"? How? I'm a genius, remember? But she's probably forgotten all about us by now. Whoa, yeah. It's been a long time. For us my friends, yes. But time in Oz passes differently than in her world. It's been years since she destroyed the Wicked Witches, but to her it's going to seem like only yesterday. Well, let's hope she got a good night's sleep. Now, you two keep an eye on that broomstick while I... - Oh, too late! - Secure the chamber! We've got to get through to Dorothy. Dorothy. Scarecrow to Dorothy. Come in, Dorothy. Come in, Dorothy. Dorothy! Toto. We're home. Em, over here. Look at this. That twister took out everything in its path. Knocked the house right off its foundation. - Do you think we can fix it? - I don't know. That's an awful lot of damage. Uncle Henry! Auntie Em? Dorothy? - Oh. - Dorothy. It's not fair! Oh, I know, sweetie. It's not fair. But it's just a house. If we have to find another one, we'll find another one. - No. We can't just leave. - Dorothy, we gotta face facts. Look at the barn. Look at the house. We'll have to have it all appraised, but we shouldn't get our hopes up. Move back. Move back. We need to create a halo of safety around this disaster area. Thank you. Excuse me. This is our home. Your home. A home is where you live. This is a disaster area. Oh. Can this not be adjusted? Then do it. Thanks so much. - And who are you? - I'm the Appraiser. Are you with the government? I didn't see a badge. Don't be rude, Dorothy. Oh, outspoken. We're... government adjacent. Hmm. Broken support beams, cracked concr... Are you writing this down? Thank you. Cracked concrete footing. - Ah! - Hey! - What do you think you're doing? - That thing was about to fall. I probably just saved your life. But I don't need any recognition. Just doing my job. Now, I've made a thorough assessment, and I'm afraid you'll have to vacate immediately. - What? - Read this. There's no reason to kick us out. We can fix it. - Dorothy, hold on. - I'll fix it myself if I have to. So sorry, but according to the state of Kansas, the fate of this property is decided by me, not some little girl. Flea-bitten, dirty, possibly rabid... You, do something useful. You've got until... sunset to vacate the premises. Meet me at the shelter in town to sign the paperwork, or we'll be back to throw you out! - Oh, oh... - Good seeing ya. Well, that's that. - Better start packing. - What? No! You heard what the man said. If he says the house is unsafe, I won't have you in it. Who is he to decide that? It's totally... it's-it's fixable. These are grown-up decisions, Dorothy. Sorry, but you're gonna have to leave this to us. Well, I'm not leaving. This is our home. Dorothy! Let's give her a little time, Em. She's been through a lot. Anybody home? Look, Toto, we can fix this. Shh. You'll scare them. Hmm. When the world turns upside down Nothing is for sure All the dreams you thought were real You can't find anymore And then there's how the pieces fly Most of all the ones inside If only I knew How to fix it all I would If only one heart All alone did any good But I feel so small What can I do at all When the world has turned upside down? Oh Nobody knows where the world's gonna fly But I still gotta give it a try If the world turns upside down On just a gust of wind Guess I should get ready now For when it comes again Come on, sweetie. What do I hold? Where will I go? And will I feel this all alone? If only I knew How to fix it all I would If only one heart All alone did any good But I'm just so small What can I do at all Now that the world has turned upside down? Turned upside down Oh. Oh, how pretty. Huh. It must be some kind of optical illusion. That's no illusion, Toto. Run! Help, Toto! Help! Dorothy! - Hi, kiddo! - Scarecrow? What is this? What's happening? We're flying you back to Oz in a rainbow mover. I invented it. - Show-off. - Cowardly Lion? It's just Lion now. - See? - Oh, my. - Dorothy. Hi, Tin Man. I am so overjoyed to see you. You guys, dragging me into a giant rainbow really scared me. I can only imagine how you must feel. Trapped alone in a giant rainbow. Surrounded by colors. It must be just horrible! Oh! Ever since he got his heart, he's been all over the place. I never had emotions before. I just want to try them all out. Dorothy, we don't have much time. There's trouble in Oz, and only you... threatening the land... and you are the only one who can stop... What's that noise? Hold that door! - What's going on? - Hang on, Dorothy. - We'll explain everything when you get here. - Where? Emerald City! I-In the Wizard's chamber. I smell flyin' monkeys! - Oh, no. - Monkeys! Dorothy. Scarecrow to Dorothy. Come in, Dorothy. - The door... - Scarecrow to Dorothy. Is starting to give! I've lost contact with Dorothy. I can't get her back! I can't hold it! Time's up! Aaah! Hurry! Come on! Oof! I can't believe it, Toto. We're really back in Oz. Wait. Scarecrow? Scarecrow! Oh, great. Come on, Toto. We've got to get to Emerald City. It sounds like the guys are in trouble. If only Glinda were here. She'd know what to do. Now, now. Oops. No, don't push. I'm coming right along. Please, if... If you would just give me my wand back. Oh, now, you don't want to do that. Don't say I didn't warn you. Magic in the wrong hands can be a very dangerous thing. Oh, Glinda. Sweet Glinda. Ah, the Jester. I am so thrilled to have you as my guest. I'm captivated. Isn't it wonderful... when two great powers as you and I... meet face-to-face, Peer-to-peer, toe-to-toe? My, but you're... silly. "Silly"? By "silly," surely you mean diabolical. No? You're laughing. It's the costume, isn't it? I know, I know. Hard to take me seriously. It's my curse. Literally. I can't take this off... ever. My wicked sister did this to me with one of her funny little spells. I knew your sister all too well. I never knew she had a sense of humor. It's not funny to me! But now I'm ready to embrace a whole new role as ruler of Oz. And you're gonna give me your Good Ozkeeping seal of approval. But I don't approve. The Land of Oz is already falling into ruin because of you. No good can come from the reign of a fool. Agh, Glinda. Glinda, Glinda, Glinda. You are such a disappointment, just like all the others. What have you done to them? Even a fool has a few tricks up his sleeve. The magic of that broomstick belongs to someone else. Uh-uh-uh. But with this little baby, the magic is magnified and becomes all mine. Dorothy Gale will stop you. She will find a way back to Oz, and she will stop you! Ooh. "Dorothy Gale will stop you." Aren't I quivering? Where once your living soul did dwell, now is nothing but an empty shell! Now do you approve? You rule, O generous Jester. Attagirl. Aw, come on! What is that? To my tower. Fly! Now just around this corner, - I'm sure there's a buttress we can slide down. - Wait! That's the window we escaped from. We're just going around in circles! - Hmm. - Some genius you turned out to be. Listen to that racket. - Sounds like they're wreckin' the place. - I think that's me. How ironic to get a heart, only to have it attack me. Oh, the pain! The pain! Gadzooks! I just realized something horrible. Dorothy could be here any minute and walk right into a flyin' monkey ambush. Oh, that is horrible. Empathy! Horror! Fear! How about I jump in there and tear 'em all apart? Just rip 'em limb from limb! Let's use brains, not brawn. Oh. Wait a minute. I have a brilliant plan. - Ah, relief. - Is it a... tear them all limb from limb plan? Nope. It's the tear him limb from limb plan. Wha... Show me the girl. Not a toy! No touchies! No touchies! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Show me the girl. Show her to me, please. Aaah! The only person who could threaten my plan... is here in Oz, and I don't know where. Do you know how annoying that is? I can't let her beat me. My plan is almost complete. And you better figure out a way to help me, or you'll be grounded, and you can kiss your wings good-bye. - Oh. - Ah! Haven't we been though this before? I don't speak monkey. Come on, Toto. Let's go find the yellow brick road. That's her? That's Dorothy Gale, the witch slayer from Kansas? Why she's just a little girl. And she's headed for Candy County. Oh! Well, I'll just let her taste their treats. Then their justice. You! Ready your minions. We're going to double our efforts. Go to the Emerald City. Join the others. And don't come back without that scarecrow, that lion and that tin can! I'll take care of the girl. Fly! Fly! Fly, my babies! Now for a little insurance. Moon and Earth and stars align. Show the wayward girl a sign. Oh, Toto. This doesn't look like the Oz I remember. Emerald City must be in that direction. - I think. - Correct! Though I'm not sure I would advise you to go. Lately, many are going, but few are returning. Whoa. You are a really fa... fabulous... owl. Oh. You're very kind. I usually hear "fat." But, of course, my theory is that I'm just not quite the right height. If I were twice as tall, for instance... Ooh! Aaah! Ow! Whoo! Ow! Oh! Oh! Oh, Oh! Ow! - Aaah! - Uh, are you okay? Physically? Yes. But I do have a large piece of bark lodged in my hindquarters... Oh! Sorry. I'm giving you too much information, aren't I? I do that. My name is Wiser. Nice to meet you, Wiser. I'm Dorothy Gale. The famous Dorothy Gale. And Toto. I'm a really big fan of your work. Timber! - Wow, you really... - Know everything? - And... - Finish other people's sentences? Oh, no, I'm doing it again! I'm sorry. I can't help it. I'll just go. Farewell, Dorothy and Toto. No, w-wait. I need to get to Emerald City, and I can't seem to find the yellow brick... - House? Wall? Fireplace? - Road. Oh, of course. Why would you be looking for a yellow brick wall? That's silly, at the very least. There's the high road, and then there's the low road. I know every square acre of Oz. But why would you want me to come with you? I'm a miserable traveling companion. - I talk incessantly. - Yes, I... I require frequent rest stops at which, I should warn you, I will also talk incessantly. It's a terrible habit, I know. But habits are hard to break. If we could break them, they wouldn't be habits. That's okay. I was hoping maybe you could... fly me there. In what? Oh. Oh, you mean me? I suppose I could do that. Only... I can't fly. I mean, I could in the past, but... There's no need to be embarrassed. Maybe you could just point the way. Ah. Actually, it's in this direction. I know a shortcut through Candy County. But I must warn you, if we're to travel through Candy County, there's one rule. - What is that? - You must obey the signs. Which will be difficult since I'm quite hungry! Whoa. Y-You did say obey the signs, right? Right. They must have changed the rules. Follow me! Whoo! It's gonna be fine Just read the signs Eat anything you want Stick around and gulp it down Till every last bite is gone You know you want it You know you need it Don't stop Go ahead and eat it Candy, candy Lots for everyone - Candy, candy - Come on. You've only just begun Help yourself 'cause there's nothing else You're gonna wanna do today Get your thrills till you've had your fill I wanna see you feed your face There's gum balls, chocolate, jelly rolls and lollipops Licorice, caramel, peppermint, butterscotch Cherry sour, shortcake, candy canes, ice cream Gummy bears, butter tarts, bubble gum and jelly beans Whoo! - Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh - Oh, it's the sweetest thing Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh - Candy, candy - Mmm. Makes me wanna sing Candy, candy Toto! Halt! You are under arrest. You are all under arrest. - Under arrest? - Yes. Sorry to say, you have broken the law. I'm being arrested by a giant marshmallow? Marshal Mallow. Second in command of the garrison at Candy County. - What did we do? - Violation of section eight, paragraph 12 of... - penal code 16165. - Penal code 16165. - Eating candy. - But we didn't know. I'm so very sorry, but there is thorough signage. They didn't say that before. Cuff 'em. Mmm, licorice. Don't even think about eating the restraints. And no licking! What are you gonna do with us? We're taking you to the Candy Courthouse, where you will be tried by Judge Jawbreaker... - The Hanging Judge? - The Hanging... - I was going to say that. - Sorry. I do that. He really does. Forward, march! - Fudge pops, lemon drops - Ouch. Fudge pops, lemon drops Are you sure this is gonna work? Trust me. I've got it all figured out. Easy for you to say. Ready, set... Run! "Run"? That's the plan? Mm-hmm. Engaging neural synaptic simulation sequence. Holy smokes! They must have called for reinforcements. - What do we do now? - Abort! Abort! Abort! Jump! Flyin' lion comin' through. Ow. Yikes! Ouch! - Look out! - Oh! Don't lose my head! Whoa-oh-oh! Tin Man, watch where you're grabbin'! Slow. Left. Ah! No, no, no! Oh! Sudden severe disappointment. Perfect! Perfect? They're leaving Emerald City, aren't they? - Dorothy can now safely retrieve our message. - Oh. Actually, that is perfect. Yeah, apart from being trapped in a sack. Order in the court! Order! Order! What's the charge? Violation of penal code 16165. - Eating candy, milord. - Eating candy? That's the worst offense on the Glycemic Index! Quiet in the peanut gallery. What do the defendants plead? - Guilty as charged. - Who are you? - I'm your legal defense team. - Why did you plead guilty? - Because this is his 499th arrest. - Mm-hmm. Well then, it's time to set an example. But the sign said, "Eat all the candy you want." Your Honor, they are entitled to a verdict from a jury of their Peeps. Oh, all right. What say ye, Peeps? - What are they saying? - Peep, peep, peep a-cheep. Can't you hear that? Guilty! Let the punishment fit the crime. I hereby sentence you to death! I knew they'd go nuts for that. Death? For eating candy? - Marshal Mallow? - Milord? I hereby order you to execute uh, uh, the execution. - Me? - Yes, you. But as an officer in the Candy County Army, I can only follow orders from General Candy Apple. - Bosh. - Excuse me, Your Judgeship. - Names, please? - What for? Your death certificates. - Wiser. - Wiser with a "Z"? - Wiser with an "S." - And your name is? Dorothy. Dorothy Gale. Dorothy Gale? The... The witch slaying girl from Kansas? Well, sort of. Mallow, approach the bench! What the devil's food is going on here? - Are you trying to make me look like a fool? - Of course not, milord. This girl is one of the greatest heroes Oz has ever known! She's well above reproach! You should know that! Everyone knows that! What do they teach you in the academy anyway? As Lord High Judge of this court, I hereby commute the death sentence. Free the prisoners! Yes, milord, but the charges must stand until General Candy Apple can be found. Well, where in confection is he? He was called to Emerald City days ago but should have been back by now. Then I suggest, Marshal Mallow, you go find him. Whew! Well, I don't know about anyone else, but I could really go for-for a little snack. - Too soon? - Yes, I think so. Inappropriate. I'm terribly, terribly sorry for all this, milady. It's just that I am duty bound to follow the general's orders. - It's okay. - Yes, we understand. I can't fathom what's taking him so long to return. - Well, we're going to Emerald City. - You're welcome to join us. I-Is that an order? No, no, it's an invitation. Well, in that case, I... I believe I can. Wow, what a great wall. It's made of china. What a great wall of china. Halt! State your name and business. My name is Dorothy, and this is Marshal Mallow and Wiser. We're trying to get through to the yellow brick road. In order to cross the wall, you'll need permission... from Her Royal Highness, the princess of Dainty China Country. Ooh, ooh. Oh, so pretty. That was a warning shot. Oh, we should, um, respect their national borders. Good comrade, sir, may we request an audience with the Dainty China princess? No. She's otherwise engaged. I mean, she's busy getting engaged. She's welcoming suitors today. Suitors. Hmm. H-He-He's a suitor. Which one? Marshal Mallow is the suitor, and he would like to ask for the hand of the Dainty China princess. - Oh. - The princess? Oh. Well, why didn't you say so? Escort the giants in! Open the gates! But I don't want to be a suitor. I don't want to get married. What if she's cute? Appearance isn't everything. The name's Mallow, not "Shallow." Touch. Now get in there. You'll do great. Figures and figurines, may I present the Royal Highness, the princess of Dainty China Country. Rays of light surround our China princess Wow! She's beautiful. Roses bow and tulips sing her name - Yes! - Diamonds shy away Suns have lost their way All when they are near our China princess Your princess Adores you too Your Highness, I present to you The first suitor with heart so true Your Brilliance Magnificence When a princess seeks a prince She has only one heart to convince A heart that seeks a gentle beating like its own - Wow. - From my unique point of view I was meant to marry you Opposites' attraction clearly shown "Opposite" is right You're a freak with freakish height I'd rather be alone Atop my throne Oh! La-la, la, la, la, la Your Highness, I present to you The next suitor with heart so true Oh, Your Shininess Your Fragileness When a princess seeks a prince There's only one heart to convince - A heart that seeks a lover flowing with romance - Yawn. Are you asleep or in a trance? Snowballs thrown in fire stand a better chance Ta. Daddy! Suitor three. When a princess seeks a prince There is only one heart to convince Stop there in your tracks I can clearly see the cracks - Do they show? - So another and another And another and another and another and another Other Suitor gets the ax - Oh! - So I suppose that's a "no" then, is it? Fine. Menders, over here. Get some glue, and lots of it. - Well, you can't win them all, eh? - Ow! - Oh! - No! - Oh, dear! - Oh, careful! - Excuse me. I'm still talking to the lady! - Put me down! - Next. Next Your-Your Hi-Hineyness. I mean, Your Shininess. Uh... Go on. Keep going. Um, uh... Uh, I-I mean, Your, um... It seems the man made of marshmallow is all mushy-mouthed. When a princess seeks a prince There's only one heart to convince A heart that flutters like the wings of singing doves One can dream the dream alone Or pursue a man unknown Companionship and someday even love Earthquake! Solid ground, shift and shake. Where once was calm soon will quake! No! Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup. Tell me the truth. How bad is it? You're still without flaw. Oh! Thank goodness. - Milady. - How is the city? - How many broken? - No one broken, but many cracked and chipped. And the city is severely damaged. That was a very heroic thing you did back there. Just doing my duty. We have a mission of the utmost importance. Menders, take that man to the hospital. Quickly! Excuse me? Your Highness. May we please pass through your country on the yellow brick road? No. You'll have to go around. But that could take weeks, and my friends are in danger. Who do you think you are, interrupting royal business with your petty travel plans? Can't you see we're in a state of emergency? Yes, I do see. My home is in trouble too. Perhaps you can make an exception for Miss Dorothy Gale? - Oh! - Oh. So this is the famous girl who vanquishes wicked witches. - I thought you'd be taller. - Milady, she is a very resourceful young woman. Ah. Perhaps you'd rather be a suitor to her. - That's not what I meant. - Silence! Oh. These are troubled times in Oz. Behind our great wall, we are safe. Now and again the Jester sends an earthquake or two just to rattle us. But never one so big. He must really be angry about something... or someone. This is your fault. - What? - Now just a min... Don't deny it. You wanted a little shortcut, so you forced your way in and brought the Jester's anger with you! I don't know any Jester. I'm just trying to get to Emerald City to see the Scarecrow. Maybe I can help your people somehow. You're just a little girl from Kansas. What could you possibly do? - But I... - She doesn't even have a title. I'm going with you. What? - I'm going with you. - No, milady. You mustn't go. You could be fractured before you reach the river. If I don't go, we could all be broken. Then I will send the royal guard with you. No, that won't be necessary. Marshal Mallow will keep me safe. You have my word, milady. My dear people, Miss Dorothy Gale, the witch slaying giant from Kansas, and her friends, will accompany me as my servants... on a mission to Emerald City to meet... with the Scarecrow. With his eminent wisdom, we will surely find a way to end the Jester's reign of tyranny. Bow to me. - Huh? - Bow to me. Lower. Not to worry, my dear people. I'll be back soon! What in the Land of Oz is taking so long? Ha-ha! They're here! Oh, I do so love having important guests. Distinguished company, welcome. You always tie your company up? As a matter of fact... yes. Are those real... people? They were real people. But now they're better than real. As puppets, they still act like people... when I want them to. Dance! You can't make someone do that against their will. Dancing is very personal. Yeah, dancing is a very per... very personal thing. I can make them do whatever I want. I pull the strings! Literally! I would rejoice At the top of my voice I'd be a true warlock But I had no choice My sister was frightful And spitefully made me a clown I shall possess My one happiness The power I covet And who wouldn't love it Would you? Now would you dare try me? And would you deny me what's mine? Well, now that's a punch line! I guess you'd have guessed A jester must jest When I laugh alone It is I who laughs best Hotfoot! Stop bouncing. You're going to scuff my finish. - I'm just walking. - You're bouncing. This is very uncomfortable. I hope you're not gonna be like this the whole trip. I am a princess! Remember? Yuck. More destruction. Where are we? This is the Munchkin River, Your Highness. It leads to Emerald City. It looks like the yellow brick road ends here. Oh, great. What do we do now? Make camp and wait for orders? We'll build a boat. And what, pray tell, will we, or rather, you, build this boat out of? - The owl? - Uh, no. We'll figure it out. How hard can it be? There are trees everywhere. Ow! Hey! Sorry. So sorry. I... How would you like it if I just walked up to you and broke your arm off? Ow! I didn't mean any harm. We're trying to get to Emerald City. And to do it we need wood... to build a boat. - A boat! - A boat? - You want to build a boat? - You've got a lot of nerve. Not my idea. Hey, I know her. Isn't she the one that stole the apples off Uncle Manny? - What? - That's her. Ow, ouch, ow! Boy, those trees really hold a grudge. At least we're out of range. - Ow. - And stay out! Take me. Take me. I would like to volunteer these old timbers as material for your boat. Oh, no. We could never hurl a talking tree. At least not on purpose. I'm 978 years old. And honestly, I don't have many rings left. I can stay here and rot, taking up someone else's sun, or I can come with you and be part of something important, something great. I don't know what to say. Except thank you. Oh, this is a very brave sacrifice you're making. No sap off my brow. Gonna get things rollin' I know I can Let's get things goin' 'cause I've got a plan Put it all together till the job is done This should be easy It should be fun Work with me Whoa! Can't get across It's sink or swim I'll build a boat It's the next best thing We're better together all as one With a little help, we can get this done, work with me Work with me I will work with you Maybe we will see just what we can do It's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true Work with me I'll work with you We need to truss that up there. We're gonna get there Need a little time - You give me yours - I'll give you mine Heads together till the end - Huh? - All I need is some help from my friends Work with me I will work with you Maybe we will see just what we can do It's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true Work with me I'll work with you Come on, you guys. Lift it up there. What the heck? Anchors aweigh! Good job! Work with me, work with me There, all finished. I think we should call it Tugg. Hey, I like that. Climb aboard, everybody. Work with me I will work with you Maybe we will see just what we can do - It's true - It's true It's true Work with me, I'll work with you Catch you later! Here we go! Tugg, you do make a wonderful boat. Well, thank you, Princess. Land ho! Oh, my. What happened to this place? It used to be... so beautiful. Hello? Lion? Scarecrow? Tin Man? It's totally abandoned. Scary, huh? What a mess. General? - Scarecrow? - General Candy Apple, sir? They've all gone. P-Perhaps they're having lunch. The courteous thing to do would be to come back later. M-Much later. Hoo. This is where the broomstick should be. No wonder things are going wrong. Oh, look. It's a prismatic tubular inter-dimensional transporter device. - What? - Huh? In simpler terms, it's a rainbow mover. This is the machine that brought me here. Technically the rainbow brought you here. The machine created the rainbow. It's sort of a chicken-and-the-egg thing. - Ahem. - Ooh, sorry. Oh, my gosh. Dorothy, that might be for you. What are the odds of that? 65 to 2? I mean... Dorothy, we don't have much time. There's trouble in Oz, and only you can help us. An evil Jester is threatening the land. His power comes from a magic scepter he has at his castle. The scepter is... Well, well, well. If it isn't the famous Dorothy Gale. You stay away from her! I'm not talking to you, puff ball. Hoo-hoo. - I, the princess of Dainty... - Silence! All right, Jester, what have you done with my friends? Your friends? What a coincidence. Why, I've got them right here. See? - They have all the comforts of home. - Yikes! Central heating. - Running water. - No! - And the coziest accommodations imaginable. - Save yourself Dorothy! You let them go! I give the orders around here now. So if you know what's good for you, you'll hop in your little rainbow mover and go back to Kansas where you belong! - No. - Either do as I say or die! Mallow, grab her! Right, milady. Owl my! Oh, why don't you sing me a song, eh? Tugg! Tugg, let's move it! What's the rush? - Flying monkeys! - Flying monkeys? Dorothy, take cover. I'll fight them off. Here they come. - Goodness me! - Oh! Hey! What do you think you're doing? Stop! Stop! Can't this old barge move any faster? Hang on! Just try and keep up. Take that! Tugg, stay to the right! Head for that cave! Aye, aye, Your Highness. They're on us! No! No, no, no, no, no! You cowards! You're letting her get away! Why do I have to do everything myself? They're not coming in. They've left us. They must be afraid of the dark! Ha! Nyctophobia! Ha! They act so tough. But I bet they sleep with a night-light on. Silly, scaredy... I can't see a thing. Me neither! I'm terrified! You're nocturnal. Get a grip. Hey, I think I see a way out. What? Fireflies! I haven't seen you guys in ages. Where have you been? Oh, they're... They're beautiful! That's the prettiest thing I've ever seen. Milady. Oh, how romantic. Where do you think we're headed? Whoa. By that compass, we are heading northwest, which means this little tributary will take us to the Jester's castle. - Yes! - Perfect! That's great. Under cover of darkness, we can belly crawl past the guards... Then we can sneak in and free my friends. Ah! We have a plan. Oh, there's a fork up ahead. Which way should we go? Let's follow the fireflies. They seem to know. Looks like right... is right. Thank you, fireflies. Aha! It's the least I could do. Have a nice ride! See you next fall! Oh, no. It's a trap. Tugg, turn back! I can't! The current is too strong! Oh! Whoa! Everyone, hold on tight! Good-bye, Dorothy Gale. Good-bye. Say good-bye to Dorothy Gale, everyone. Let that be a lesson to all of you. Don't... mess... with the Jester! What have you done? Mmm. Oh. Is everyone okay? You all right? - Yes, ma'am. - Wiser? Hmm? Affirmative. Toto? - Tugg? - Oh. A few splinters. China Princess? China Princess? Princess! China Princess! Oh, no. Oh. I should have protected her. I neglected my duty. Mmm. Where are you going? I'm going to confront the Jester myself. I can't let anyone else get hurt. - We won't let you go alone. - Don't follow me. - But we've come this far. - That's an order. How? How is it possible she survived? Foiling those stupid monkeys is one thing, but surviving my waterfall trick? I mean, that's a good trick! Positively... humiliating. Idiot! This is all your fault! Dorothy would be dead by now if it weren't for this abysmal failure. Your abysmal failure, pal. How dare you ruin my perfect record of jesterly awfulness? Well, don't say I didn't warn you, you fuzzy evolutionary reject. You're grounded! Ready the castle! Roll out the welcome mat for Miss Dorothy Gale. She's going to get the kind of reception that's to die for. Ow! Is there anything I can do? Yes. Get some help. How? Oh, I don't know, smart guy! Figure it out. Forgive me. Ah! - Ooh! Ooh! - You're flying. You're flying! I am? I am! Ouch! I mean, I mean, it's been a long time. I will find help, but I don't know how long I can stay up. Believe in yourself, soldier. Dorothy's life depends on it! Sir. Yes, sir. Ooh, ooh. Ow. Ooh! Never told you But I meant to Before I could begin Even then I loved you even then See my heart is scared of places That it's never been But even then I loved you even then If my voice should start to tremble If I am shaking I love you now Like I loved you even then - Even if it's uphill now - See my heart is scared of places - Even when I can't say how - That it's never been - Even when my heart won't stop pounding - My heart won't stop pounding Even then Even then I'll keep on even then I loved you even then Even if it's uphill now Even when there are no words how When my heart pounds this loud Even then If I left you I never meant to And I won't pretend Even then I loved you even then If I just knew how to show you Let me try again I love you even now Like I loved you even then Even then Even then Well, this is it, Toto. Hmm. Glinda! Oh, Glinda! I'm so glad to see you. Hello, Dorothy and Toto. Welcome to the Jester's wonderful palace. Glinda, what's wrong? Nothing is wrong. Everything is simply delightful. Oh, no! What has that horrible Jester done to you? The Jester isn't horrible. He's the most generous Jester who ever lived. All hail the Jester! All hail the Jester! The generous Jester of Oz! Scarecrow! Tin Man! Lion! Glinda. Somebody, help! All hail the Jester! The generous Jester of Oz! What's wrong with all of you? Why won't you help me? Because I... don't want them to! Thanks, everybody! Job well done. Back to your cubbies. Thank you. All hail! All hail! Aren't they just marvelous? And so obedient. What have you done to them? Don't worry. I won't let them kick the bucket. Besides, buckets are your weapon of choice, aren't they? Like the one full of water you threw on my sister. Your sister? The Wicked Witch? But I didn't mean to kill her. Oh, don't apologize. After all, she was wicked. And if it wasn't for your meddling, this little baby might never have found its rightful master. The witch's broomstick! I gave that to the Wizard for the protection of Oz. You stole it! It belongs to me! And no little girl from Kansas is going to take it away! Where once your living soul did dwell... Ah! Get me outta here! I can't see a thing! Good work, Toto! Great job. Dorothy. Is that you? Oh, I was so worried about you. I'm so glad you guys are all right. Aw, I think things are better by the minute now that you're here. We were worried about you too. You are very brave to come and rescue us. That's not good! Get me outta here! Your heart is stronger than the Jester's magic any day. Ah! It's beyond belief. Come back here, you fuzzy freak of nature! - Come on! - Right behind you, kiddo. Let me at 'em! You! Oh, I see. Someone is feeling pouty. I think I've let you hold that scepter long enough. Now give it back! You! Flea-bitten, dirty, possibly rabid... Not you. This you. Just throw it to me! No! Throw it to me! Hey, back off, or I drop the little dog. Toto! Sixty-two degrees north, with a radial arc of 2.5... Please, tell me you're calculating how I can eat 'im! Tin Man, present arm. Loading concentric projectile trajectory schematic. No! Toto! Whoa! Wiser, you're flying! I know! I-I am! - Isn't it fantastic? - Oh, thank goodness. Yeah. It's a simple matter of wind speed... thrust and... Aah! Ow! Oh! Ooh! - Oh! Ooh! - Bravery. I was going to say weight. Aha! No! Tugg! Look at you! Call me Tank now. - Dorothy Gale! - Dorothy! Princess, you're okay! Fractured, but not broken. Why are people always helping Dorothy Gale? Ouch! Troops deploy! The cavalry has arrived! Hooray! - Oh! This is all your fault! - Oh! Get the troops and destroy those trespassers! Go! Brains, Heart and Courage Brigade reporting for duty, sir. Fall in, recruits. Glad to have you on board. Forward! Battle stations! Shotgun. I called shotgun! Let's give these monkeys what for! - Ready the candypult! - Gum balls loaded, sir. - Here they come! - Let fly! Fire! Fire! Ahh! Stop it! Let 'em have it! Soldiers, cake formation! Charge! Gotcha! Knock yourself out! It's all straw! How about this, you flyin' monkey? Want some of this? Where you going? You fools! Come back! Ah, who needs 'em? Winds of fortune, winds of fate, winds come forth and eliminate... Dorothy! Oh, no. Dorothy, run! In a twister, you fell from the sky. And in a twister, you shall die! Everyone, run for cover. Now! Take shelter in the alcoves! Dorothy, wait. Attack! - Oh! - Stop! Well, aren't you a persistent little Munchkin. The scepter's power is mine to wield. Dorothy Gale, your fate is sealed! No! Give... me... that. Grab on! Pull! Oh, Dorothy, I'm forever in your debt. The least I could do is, oh, I don't know, perhaps help you rule Oz? Oz has its leaders, and they don't need this to rule. No! My baby! Fly, fly. Don't ever leave me! Oh! Oh, Glinda. It's you. - It's really you. - Yes. The Jester's spell is broken, and we couldn't have done it without you. Oh, it wasn't just me. I couldn't have done it without all of you. But Kansas must be missing you by now. I'd love to stay, but I do think I'm ready to go home. Whatever will we do without you? There will always be a rainbow when you need one most. Good-bye, Dorothy. Good-bye, my friends. Good-bye, Dorothy. Dorothy. For the first time ever, I'm at a loss for words. Hoo. Which reminds me, there's actually a very funny story about... - Good-bye, Wiser. - Hoo. Good-bye, Dorothy. And thank you. - Good-bye. - Good-bye, Dorothy! Good-bye, Dorothy. Good-bye. - Say good-bye Toto. - Good-bye! - Good-bye, Dorothy. - Good-bye, everybody. Good-bye. Auntie Em! Uncle Henry! - Henry! She's over here! - Yeah, there she is. Oh! Where on earth have you been? I see you're almost packed. Dorothy, we've been through this already. Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, there's something we can do. - What? There's what? - Follow me! - Dorothy, wait! - Come on! Hey! Where are you going? Sign this. Can you write? 'Cause an "X" will do. Next! Wait! Oh, goody gumdrops, look who it is. Everyone, please. Don't listen to him. These are our homes! And nobody has the right to take them away from us. Au contraire, my puppet. This document gives me full authority to do exactly that. - Next! - Has anybody even looked at this? - Gimme... - No. - Give... me... that. - Yep, that's her. Dorothy! Watch it. Someone get me out of here. Would you stop it? Look, look. Who is this guy? - Hmm. - Which one is he really? Well, let's just see. - Get me out of here. - Huh? - Get me out of here! - I'll get you outta here and right to jail. - Let's go, joker. - Please, you're making a horrible mistake. - Good riddance! - You can tell that to the judge. Hey, what about him? Where is he going? Get him. Stop him! He's getting away! This is all his fault. He made me do this! I was coerced. I didn't want to! I'm so proud of you. That's our girl. One day, there'll be laughter Blue skies ever after One day, it's gonna be fine In my world, dreams have come and gone In my life I know I must be strong I knew we'd get through this Look how much we've grown I knew we could do this Who says you can't go home? One day, there'll be laughter Blue skies ever after One day, it's gonna be fine I know, come tomorrow Someway, beg or borrow I believe dreams really can come true Yes, they do Somehow, everything has changed Together, we can build it up again We'll pick up the pieces It isn't done alone We've been waiting to do this To find our way back home Oh, when it all comes falling down Oh, you've got to turn it all around Yes, I will, yes I will One day, there'll be laughter Blue skies ever after One day, it's gonna be fine I know, come tomorrow Someway, beg or borrow I believe dreams really can come true Yes, they do One day, one day One day When the world turns upside down There's just one thing to do Shake it off and get back up And night in front of you There is work to do and miles to go No need to stick it out alone You're not alone There's something I know How to change the bad to good Our hearts together Go further than just one heart could If you feel so small You're not alone at all When the world has turned upside down We can see just what we can do Oh, no, we don't know where the world is gonna fly But we still gotta give it a try When the world turns upside down It takes your breath away Think of all the wondrous things That happen every day No matter how you add it up What turns the world is always love It's always love There's something I know How to change the bad to good All hearts together Go further than just one heart could If you feel so small You're not alone at all When the world has turned upside down Has turned upside down Has turned upside down
