That is because, after a great consideration and consultation... ...I came to the conclusion that this socialist illusion was... ...a great botheration to the Indian nation... ...whose basic occupation was cultivation and irrigation. But with further contemplation and deliberation... ...I discovered that without globalization and.. ...exploration there can not be optimization to make India's... ...transformation to a super power nation. So... How about Bangalore for yourfirst posting Mr. Krishnan P.P? On asking like that. Which Malayali can say, no, to that? While in Kerala, we're desperate to leave... When outside, we're desperate to get back, to native place. As soon as weekend, comes I board the first bus to go home to Kerala. Whatever any one says. Water, soil and women... ...are the best in our place. Father! I'm here, man. How was yourjourney? It was fine, father. Brother Narayanan! Hello! My son, how is my cultivation? Hey fellow! Every week you bring the soiled cloths from Mysore. You, yourself does the washing by battering. Then why can't you do this there itself? What are you saying, mom? The water out there, is it like our water in here? Mysore isn't our place, our place is Kerala. (singing a popular Malayalam song) See the acts of this boy! "Hi, tie, candy. - Hi, tie, candy." Liked on eating. Liked on eating. After eating it, it will turn out to a dismay. After eating it, it will turn out to a dismay. Do you know who wrote this poem? Kunjunni master. Yes, it is a poem by Kunjunni master. Let us read another one. Kutta, the bus will arrive now. Did you pack everything? Don't forget anything. If you sit with poetry like your father, you won't reach anywhere. This is our Kunju. My father's sister's daughter. Hi! I'm Divya Prakash. Final year B.com. Divya Prakash, what is your ambition? I want to do MBA from IIM and start an independent company. Who is your inspiration, Divya? My parents. They give their full support to all my dreams. What kind of change can you bring in this world, Divya? If you take the total working labor in this world. It's women who do 67% of work. But if you calculate the total assets, in the world. Women don't have even 1 % of it. That must change. When I start my own company. Will give more jobs to women. This is the condition of, most of the girls educated from Gulf countries. By mixing up English and Malayalam. By rendering 2 long sentences. They think they have conquered this world. Don't hear all this boosting. she's just an innocent, dumb girl. Mothers, smart daughter! Give the paper to there. I'll give. Here, did you see this? See this. My daughter has got first rank. Pass it on to them. Everyone is looking at you. Until, monthly once if astrological consultations are not done. Aunty, won't be having peace of mind. Did you see a lame person on your way here? Yes, was seen here. Yes. An omen. Isn't he the peon here? Whatever it may be... An omen is definitely an omen. Yes. Yes. Did you understand? Hear! When my brother had a daughter, I foresaw. Unlucky planets in the seventh house... A bad omen. The very sight of unlucky planets. I told him many times not to educate her. I, also warned that she will create ill-fame, but in vain! During degree studies. Fell in love with a guy. That too, one hailing from another religion. She eloped with him. Once everything was over, he deserted her. I asked him then, didn't I warn you? Your daughter also, has the same kind of horoscope. Aunt will only listen to the astrologer. Uncle will listen only to aunt. Is there, any need to say more? Isn't there a remedy to this? Can find a remedy and all. But... Within two months. This girl's marriage should be conducted. Oh! My heavens. Otherwise... As someone said in some movie... ...this is fate, my dear. No one can stop that. In one look of the unlucky planets, MBA dreams vanished. In its place arrived an MBA guy... 28 years old. Good looks. Good habits. Das. Have one nibble... It was made by Divya. Have tea. Divya, sit there, dear. Go, dear. When did you return from the USA? Last week. Okay then. Where are you based in the USA? Los Angeles. My sister's daughter is there. Is it? Where are they, over there? In US, 'Oklahoma'. Oklahoma. Do you visit, those places? No... No. They don't go there. We have been there. Yes, we have many photos of that. Come, will show you. Let us see the photos. - Let them talk to each other. Children, come along. Son, she has appeared for MBA entrance exam. Which University have you applied to? I have been enlisted at IIM. Waiting for the interview call. Nice. Divya? Divya... I, was having a serious relationship with a girl. Even though it is in past... I don't think I'm over it. I really don't know if I'm ready for this. When my parents and others compelled me... It is nothing personal. I felt, Divya, should know all this. Divya, do you have anything to say? That is... I didn't make that nibble. So then I don't have to struggle with it? Mother's nibbles are eaten by him. Like that. Kunju's fate was also decided. While others decided, both of our destinies... There is a 3rd person who doesn't fall in none of this. The so called Arjun, who is Aju. Make it fast, fast. Hey, what are you doing there on top? Run... run away. Run... run away. The one who has escaped from the clutches of expectations. Long ago. When we mugged up answers, he found questions. When we tightly held onto seats that we obtained. He disdained the one and escaped. In various cities, did different kinds ofjob. In short, a new generation gypsy. His normal practice is running away under cover. - Hi! - Aju, what are you doing? Man. Nothing as usual. Isn't it time to hug your teddy bear and sleep? Can't believe is it not? Everything happened suddenly. Get lost. I have some news. What is it? My marriage has been fixed. What? The 18th of this month. Within two weeks time. Is he known to you? Yes. I met him today. Today? Arranged marriage? Were you forced from the house? Nothing like that. He is a nice guy. Good fellow. Kunju! I know it is a surprise. But it's all fine. Do you know what the best part is? After marriage, straight to Bangalore. Do you remember, in the past all three of us had planned. To have a rocking time in Bangalore? A bus ticket will take you to Bangalore. No need to marry forthat! Get here by the 17th. Ceremonies are at our ancestral house. Wedding is in Swati Hall. Whatever it is, it is betterto marry of girls who are in this generation. What about your MBA plans? Left everything, is it not? Idiot! Hello! Are you the one saying who haven't passed even 12th? Gopichetta! Divya's marriage has been fixed. Is the Colonel coming? When has your father attended anything in this family? When will you be coming? Tell me that. I am not coming for any wedding. Aju, you haven't come native, since school days. If you don't attend my wedding, I'll never talk to you again. Is it a promise? Idiot! It was like that, right from the olden times. Divya, Aju and me. Many of the dreams and memories of childhood. We, 3 used to share. As the school vacation arrives. They both will land up with me at the ancestral house. Then for two months we used to have a jolly time. With cars, bike and cycle, a world of our own. Then, jumping in the pond, play cricket, secretly smoke cigarettes. To get the caning for that. For everything, we were together. But once school days were over. 3 got departed to 3 different routes. During those times, one among the dreams that we saw was. Bangalore. "A cage for the green bird" "A cage with vegetable window sills" "A cage for the green bird" "A cage with vegetable window sills" "The groom is coming for the marriage" "That is to lock you" "First comes the marriage" "Then begins the life" "First comes the marriage" "Then begins the life" "First comes the marriage" "Then begins the life" Who is this? Shobha's colonel brother's son. The fellow ran away from boarding school. "Your hubby, will say beloved and dear one in the early days" "You will also say my dear, you don't remain in the sun shine" "Oh, then the story will change" "The real warrior in him erupts and the weapons will be drawn" "Hey! Hey! Make that move! Hey! Hey! Win the duel!" Hey fellow! Aren't you a software engineer? Mind your dignity and sit somewhere in here. "Hear? Did you hear? Once, trapped inside this cage..." "The blue skies will not be seen again. Somebody is saying that" "My beloved, beloved I'll make a false key" "Alongside the flying birds, I, too will fly up in the sky" "To see how this smarty... is tamed by her hubby..." "And to see trapped... There is a desire to see, in the mind" "By blocking the entry of naughty flock of ants" "He will create a heaven for me" "First comes the marriage" "Then begins the life" "A cage for the green bird" "A cage with vegetable window sills" "A cage for the green bird" "A cage with vegetable window sills" "The groom is coming for the marriage" "That is to lock you" "First comes the marriage" "Then begins the life" "First comes the marriage" "Then begins the life" "First comes the marriage" "Then begins the life" "First comes the marriage" "Then begins the life" Divya! Enough of the dance and play. Did you forget. It's your wedding tomorrow? Come. Come, I say. Please move back. "First comes the marriage" "Then begins the life" Where? Where is Kunju? Kunju! Hey, Aju! How did you reach here? Somehow reached. Brother Kuttan! Come... come... You come here. Hello! Hello! Brother Kuttan! Catch me. My God! Climb and come, Kuttan. Hey fellow! This monkey left me and went. Did anyone see you both climbing in? Then what? Uncle, aunty and everyone saw. We came as we didn't want you dying of depression. That is not the matter. When we told that we wanted to meet you. Uncle said, she is the bride. You can't meet hertoday. Meet hertomorrow in the marriage hall. On hearing that, he didn't like it. Then what? Since, tomorrow some fellow is going to marry you. On saying we can't meet you and all. Seeing him now, can say, he is the boy who ran away from school before. Isn't it, Brother Kuttan? I wish, I had also run away from school. Like him. If it were like that. Would have remained flying like this. If everyone becomes like me. Who will do the software job in our country? Look! Don't talk software. People begun hating it! Then why are you doing this job? That is because. On fearing aunty. In brother Kuttan's life father, mother everyone has got a say in it. Except for brother Kuttan. Is it so? Like you. No, man. I'm I, not lucky? A very good smart, good looking husband. While studying at school, what were the things? All that is over, now it is arranged marriage. That was all while at school, is it not? You are still not changed. Then, brother Kuttan what are the other things? Now, I left all that. Left all the girls also? Go man! Dropped the racing. Why is that? I thought.. I, just can't follow their rules and regulations. Aju. Aren't you continuing the education? Everyone in here was asking that. The Kerala, has got the highest rate of suicides and heart attacks. Why is that? The reason for heart attack, is it not coconut oil? No, you fellow! Expectations. Family members and compatriots. You are all living inside the pressure cooker, of others expectations. When the pressure increases, the whistle will be blown. The life gone! What is the connection between that and education? In the very same Kerala. Has got the highest literacy level. Now, is there connection? Afterthe schooling. Aren't you writing entrance? On completing degree. Job, not yet obtained? On getting the job. What is the salary? On getting good salary. When is the marriage? After the marriage. Not yet having the children? If the baby is not conceived. Do you want the number of the doctor? On conceiving the child. The same old questions. For the time being, no one has got high expectations on me. Let it remain like that only. Forget of my case. How are your things going? Is the training at Mysore over? Got ready to go to Bangalore? Truly speaking, I'm not interested to leave this place and go. On going to this Bangalore and Mysore. It is like trapped in some place. If it is here means, we can bath in our pond, can go to temple. Can have the Matta, rice grown in Palaghat. Are you going there, to have Matta rice of Palaghat? That's not the thing. Somehow I didn't like that much. Sometimes, I, used to go. There is a big market of automobile parts. But, whatever city, it may be. Company, should be there. Then, only can enjoy. After my arrival, shall we go for a tour? Then I'm also joining. No need, you get married and be a good girl and stay at home. Is it so? Yes. Hey girl! Kunju! Same old behavior. Divya! Daughter, Divya! Haven't you got up yet? Open up the door, child! Brother Kuttan! Aju! Get up! Won't allow to sleep also. God! Got fed up with this girl. How to get up at these times? Coming, mother. I'll be there at the marriage stage. Okay fine, you may go. Okay. Good morning, uncle. Have you landed up here In the morning itself? We reached last night itself. Aju, wait! I'll also come. God! Daughter, Divya! Oh! Come down, man. Is there anyone else who need flowers? Make way... make way... Sister, move aside please. Divya Prakash, all set? How do I look? Like a Christmas tree. Go man! You tell, Brother Kuttan. Brother Kuttan will always tell the truth. You look like a decorated baby elephant... ...of Thrissur Pooram festival. Elephant? No, baby elephant. Divya, can't you remain quiet at least on your wedding day, child? Shobha! The groom's party has reached. You go there fast. Keep this box safely. I'll see to all that. You go. Sister, will you send the girls to receive them? Go fast! Right... right... right. Let all the welcoming girls group leave. Do you really have such long hair? Son, won't you all be here? Let me just peek at the groom and come. Okay sure. Does the bride want to see the groom? What I still don't understand is... ...why is there such a hurry to see the groom? He won't leave before the wedding is over, right? Then, afterthe wedding what will be your name? Divya Prakash to... Divya Das. Why is that? Is it a transfer of ownership? To change the name. Everyone is changing, is it so? Men don't! Oh! Brother Kuttan! I don't want to marry. I don't want to marry. Come let's elope. Aju, be quiet. What are you saying? If you are not willing to marry, why did you agree? That... I... then... Divya. Excuse me! Open the door child. Look, daughter is not opening the door. Aju, take it from her. Divya! Shoba, please come here. What are you doing? Open the door. Hey, take a snap, man. Okay, then. Kuttan! Come. Careful! The first night is in the middle of lagoon. Should be careful. Okay. I don't know how to swim? There is no need to swim, going no where leaving the shore. Then, what is the use of it? The thing is. It was the sister's idea. Sister's husband is a navy officer. Thank God! He is not in the army. Signal is very weak. No. I just changed now. In office, I actually handle mergers and acquisitions. Today, there is an important merger closure. I have a video conference now. It'll take some time. You can go to sleep, Divya. Morning, have to go to Guruvayoor, is it not? Let me check whether there is signal outside. That room is locked up, with some old stuff. Mother has asked Chinnamma to come and help you, Divya. Once she comes, things will be easier for you, Divya. It is Chinnamma who has looked after me in childhood. There was no milk. It is black tea. I'll get it while coming back in the evening. It is enough if you introduce me to some neighbor. I'll go and buy myself. I don't know anyone out here. From how long are you living here? I was in Kochi. For MBA coaching. That time I got friendly with everyone in that building. This is not Kochi. This is Bangalore. Here no one has got time for anything. I'll wash that. No need. I like to do my things myself. Then do mine too! Hallo! Yes mother. I'm in the lift. I'll call you. Are you a Malayali? No, I'm not a Malayali. What all things they should know? Whether a Malayali or a worker. Kuttoos! Hey Aju! When did you reach? That and all reached. Is this my room? Greetings, Arjun brother! So you have finally come to Bangalore, is it? Greetings, Fayaz! This is a cool place, man. That is why I called you. You'll love it. This is our garage, Arjun. Duddu. Yes brother. This is Arjun Bhai, from now on he will be working with us. Studebaker! Yes, Studebaker. Come Arjun Bhai, this is our own place. They told they will get a good guy for me. The race season is going to start. Hey, Samy Bhai! How are you? How is the practice and all going? Yea, going on. Who is that chap? Slightly hot tempered. But he does a very good job. Arjun Bhai. That workshop, this cafe, motor cross track. All belongs to Sami Bhai. All of them are 'Storm Riders'. Samy Bhai is the boss of the gang cum leader. I'm not the boss. That is Shiva. Shiva! Shiva was a an all time champion. I have never seen him. But no one has ever beat him in racing. When can I see the bikes? It is in the track. I'll show you. Look what is the screen pass word of this? Don't put my photos on the face book. Oh! Uncle, that's my husband. Is he this girl's husband? Please come, now we have got lot of friends over here. Can meet every one. Today while I was painting, got struck outside the balcony. I shouted a lot from there. No one heard. Then I had even send a rocket. That was seen by lyyer uncle. Iyyer uncle, then called every one and then children dropped... ...me a screw driver. Divya! Then I... Divya, this is my private space not a public park. Not that. Did I say? When I got struck, they were the people who helped me. Let it be. Why creating this kind of situations? Then why is the house kept all messed up like this? Drawing something on the walls and on the glass? If it is painting, why not do it on paper or canvas? Mother. It is good that you asked me to come here. Yes. Madam, what are you saying? Everything in this house is happening upside down. The house is complete mess. When I came in the morning. Won't wash the dishes, glasses. When I came, saw baby Das making coffee to that girl, daily. Only afterthat, he is going to office. That girl doesn't even wake up. Why did you get Das baby married to such a girl? Madam, she has come. You phone me daily in the evening. I'll be at home by then. I'll talk freely. Shall I, hang up, madam? Give regards to all in America. It's futile to do all this forthem. No matter what training is done, they will never ride properly. Why are you so tense Sir? Because I, happen to be their coach. Job of a coach is to teach, right? Teaching these guys about bikes... ...ls like preaching to cattles. That's true. We'll do well, coach. The trust is everything, is it not? Just because your father has got money don't play, Sami. If it goes on like this. We'll have to shut down the club. This is fantastic, man. The power of this would have increased now, Isn't it? Yes. This style of sitting has to be changed. See that dip? That's the sweet spot. Sit on it. Chin should always be on top of the handle bar. I'll show you. Hold it. This is the correct posture. Why are you looking for another place to stay? If your folks at native come to know, that I'm with you. That's enough. To protect the software engineer, aunty will come flying. When is Kunju, coming? Oh! She must have reached. Should I, call her? Isn't there any honeymoon? No, he seems to be busy. It's like that once you arrive in Bangalore. This is the first time I am leaving office early. Let this be a good beginning. How much is it? Hello! Arjun here. Hello. What's up sir? I'm on my way. Kuttan's, hop in the vehicle. The car has to be delivered. Well! Did you see this? What is it? In Bangalore you can see many things like that. You get inside the car. But still... Are they kissing and playing? Let them play, man. Gosh! You try to get in quick. Shall we go? Aren't they stopping it? Too bad! What a pity? The culture of Kerala is always better. Why is that? Does no one kiss in Kerala? Anyway, not on the roadside! Aju, this is not meant for us. We have our own culture. Don't we have our values? This is not culture or history, Kuttan. It's pure biology. If it is biology, it is applicable to all is it not? Why to me and you, it's not like that? We are all, taught to walk in the straight path of virtue. Why are you not saying anything? Kutta... Speak of your kind of things. Aju... You! When was it? How? That is.. When was that? I was not told about that. Gosh! Hey Kutta. Your case.. Aju... This is a betrayal. What betrayal? No need to laugh. Wait and see. I'll also not tell you anything. Just cool down man. Forget my matter. Kuttan, so you have never... Ever? Go man! Search some other guys forthat. You won't get this Kuttan for all that. It is against my culture. That's true. "By applying collyrium to the eyes" "On putting marks on the fore heads. The outside state ladies" "Came walking" What were we talking about? Culture. Yes... Culture. It is not because you are scared of girls. Isn't it? Why should I be scared? Whether the leaf falls on the thorn... ...or the thorn on the leaf, It's the leaf that is hurt! I'll set him right. Hey! What? Is it necessary, that you have to whistle on seeing the girls? I'll knock your teeth out. What did she say? She said, I love you brother. Go man! I know that much Hindi and all. No that Kuttan's. Now, are you a leaf or a thorn? I'll show you man, will do some tricks and won't say anything. Shit! Give me that! Kunju! Hi! What kind of an attire is this? Your mango juice. Thank you. This is Aju. Arjun. Remember seeing at the wedding. Do you remember all those who attended the wedding? This is Brother Kuttan. You are turning roly-poly, okay. That is because of eating out. That's why. Did you cook? Yes, traditional, good food. That's nice. It's been long since I've eaten homemade food. When did you learn to cook? She and her apron! Today's special, mango Pulisheri (a curry) Cabbage dry curry. Then prawns fry. Great! Just like what is prepared by aunty. Is this the kitchen? Do you want anything to drink? Okay, all right then. Brother Das! Soft drink is enough. What did he call him? Dasettan!(brother Das) Yes. Do you also call, like that? I don't, call like that.. but you must call like that. Yea, indeed I, calling good, for sure. Don't touch all that, Aju. Why are you sitting here? Did you shower today? Go and sit there. Where is your mango juice? Everyone here likes apple juice. Divya, can you get the pickle? Yes. When the stock market crashed, was really panicked. Then from mutual funds shifted to insurance. No need to take risk. At what rates are you getting? 6.2%. You'll get better rates than that in the market. Is it, so? Then, must enquire about that. Tasty lemon pickle. Is it? Is it good? Really good. Do you remember a time before she entered the kitchen? Brother Kuttan, no. You mean, the incident when aunty, went to Guruvayoor, is it not? Brother Das. On that day, her mother's sister was fed with pizza. On telling what, did she fed her? Telling, it is some kind of cakes made by her. Told, it is cakes. What was Divya's age at that time? It was two months back. Divya, it is me, you are kicking. Sorry! Aju! So, Arjun! Where are your parents? So you don't know the family history, is it not? Why, is that Kunju? Didn't you tell him? My parents are divorced. Okay. Where are they now? Is there a problem? What problem? Father is a colonel in the army. Somewhere on the China border. Mother is a house wife. In somebody's house, someone's wife. You don't sound like you approve of it. Who am I to approve? Marriage is a legal punishment. Haven't you heard of it? Either life sentence or a big fine. She doesn't want life sentence, anyway. Then the fine. That is on my head! Aju, do you know what I have made for dessert? Yourfavorite milk dessert. Come and help me. Kuttan. Yes. I'll go for a jog and come. Not that. We are about to leave, Brother Das. No..no, Relax. Look! Shall we drop them in the evening? Okay, we'll see. My goodness, I could have asked about the film. Look. To call look, look, is he a scare crow or what? Granny, cakes, Pizza... what was all that? I should be blamed for having called you, people. We didn't say anything un true. Wait till you both get married. I'll show you at that time. What? Aju, he didn't know all this. He didn't say anything to hurt you. Is it not because he doesn't know? Leave, Kunju! What is the use? If he knows me. I'm not bothered, if others felt like. Without any father's or mother's care off, I'll reach somewhere. You can reach anywhere you want. Bettertake us along. Yes. You have no other choice in that matter. Isn't it? Isn't it? Tell, tell, tell. Even auto is running faster than us. What is it? No, that is, he was saying cinema is at 7 o'clock. Only 10 more minutes are remaining. Shall we drop the plan? In this traffic we can't reach there. What? Tell. That is because it was Lallettan's movie. What? Tell him to stop. Should I say? Tell man. Brother Das, will you stop here? There. What happened? No that, it is a good climate is it not? Just thought we will just walk. On walking, will reach fasterthan this. We'll watch the film and let you know how it was. Bye aunty. If you are coming, you come. Simply talking and staying there. Aju, wait there. Next Saturday, have booked tickets to go to U.S. Oh! Then, don't we need to apply for visa? It is there. Sometimes I, used to go regarding work. Sometimes two weeks. Sometimes two months. So, like that. When I'm not here are you going to native alone with Kuttan? Or are you staying back in here? However it may be. Decide and tell. Take man. Hey, it is Kunju! Brother Kuttan, it is me. Yea, tell, tell. Is Aju there? Yea, he is here. I'll give. For you only. Kunju the movie was rocking. Go man. I called to ask one thing. Tell. Look, it seems, mister is going to U.S for work. Then asked me are you staying here or going home? What to do? Should I go or stay. Of course no need go tell Kuttan to take the leave. What is it? Then shall I say? Go on. Bye. "By winking the eyes" "We see.. The dream Bangaluru" "Along with the hooting wind, that sings" "Can roam around and see Bangaluru" "With the thread snapped kite" "Like a bird..Which has left the nest and the land" "Can fly with the hearts content" "Bangaluru" "Our native, Bangaluru" "Our native, Bangaluru" "Our native, Bangaluru" "By winking the eyes" "We see.."

Yea, that correct. Santhosh and Aravind, they are national champions. Come. Brother Kuttan Look. Arjun! Beauty. Isn't it? Hey man, hold, don't go like that. Banned riders are rarely seen around here. Let me see such a kind. Ban is only while racing. Not to see. That's a good one. Generally for the riders whom I have seen... ...will have certain extend of shame. But your guts, hats off to you, man. Don't Farhan. What is it, Bro? What's his problem? Now, are you in this joker's gang? Storm riders! Joker gang? You have ever been able to cross, Shiva, even in one lap? Then, simply don't show off too much here. Joker... Jo..Ker Hey! Sami! Leave him! Hey man! He had created the issue. Come out fellow! Go out! Go! Aju! Don't go now. We'll go after sometime. It is enough if we go after sometime. Take the key Kutta! Will drive speedily and bang somewhere. Will only go after some time. Take the key man! Aju! Aju! Aju! You would have at least told us. What should I say? Where ever I have gone, I was chucked out, is it the one? That I'm a reject piece? Aju! Aju. After all, we can understand. Hey fellows! You can't understand anything. Then who else will understand, Aju? Life is not through your ass man! Aju! On thinking that can you fight with every one? Aju! Get lost fellow! Brother Kuttan! No need, go. Isn't that Arjun? How do you know him? Last year he was a rookie in Mangalore. He beat the best of the guys hands down. Yes, he has got good speed, but. Did he not get into some trouble for something similar? I won't be surprised. He is too brash with everything. May be he needs just a good coach. May be you'll get a good rider. Shall we go? So, Farhan committed foul at the track. You whacked him out side and made it a 'toofan'(wind) Then, like that you got the ban is it not? It was not ban, a disciplinary action. A one year restriction. But riding on the road, they can't do anything on it. Let them hug the ban and sit there. Where were you all this time? You are the reason. There was a call to herfrom your house. Father and mother? Yes. See..Didn't I tell? If I, don't go home every weekend, they will be sad. Oh! That is not the matter. We must find a good girl for Kuttettan. Which kind of girls does Kuttettan like? Has told to find out all this..By aunty. Oh! So that was the matter is it? I, thought... What did you think? What did you think? What did you think? Come on tell man. Then brother Kuttan tell. Which kind of girl does Kuttettan like? Greetings sir. Kunju! It's new generation is it not? Just ask, whether a girl or guy is required. Go man! Come on, brother Kuttan you tell. If it is guy also, we can think over it. Tell brother Kuttan. A girl is enough! Like which kind of girl? How to say...? There is nothing in special. Should be a traditional girl. The country bumpkin type? Go man! Having our culture, no, a girl with my kind of culture. A girl who is born and brought up in Kerala only. Hey! What is this for? Then, minimum an engineer. Or else should posses at least a post graduation degree. Rank holders shall be given special consideration. What else is required? With good hair..With good eyes and all. Must be beautiful to look at. Then what else to say? Then, should have a traditional name. Like the names of cows and all. Give. Like Nandhini, Lakshmikutty and all. This kind of..Sheena, Meena, Tina all that won't work out. While during the bride seeing ceremony.. Must wear good sari and all. In the tray, what to say...? With tea and eatables. Should bring all kinds of things. Is it? There are special points for all that. Then one more thing. That can be mentioned only after the marriage. Tell, tell. Tell, tell. Must address me as 'Chetta' (wives calling their husbands) After keeping this much things in mind, he had told nothing is there. As if all this will happen! Let heads mans, blessing be there. Lord, let his nonsense be saved. So let it take place! Rocking movie is it not? Cool! Shahrukh ruled! Is it not? Hey man, Aju have you taken brother Das's car? It's just a car is it not? Aju, should be careful okay. What 19 missed calls. Who is there for you, to give this much missed calls? From home only. Slowly man. Hallo, yes mother I had gone for a movie. Which hospital? When? What, hospital? What did doctor say? Is it for the uncle? I'll come immediately, mother. Breathlessness. Has been admitted in Karuna hospital. Telling, some check ups forthe heart is needed. Aju, I need to go home immediately. Will I get any of the bus at this time? Bus and all might have gone. Why not, drop you at the air port? Will check out, if there is any flight. Every week I, used to go home. This is forthe first time, like this. Aju! Tickets and all might have cost lot of money, is it not? Shut up man! If you don't take a flight at this time, then when are you going to take? Here ticket. I'm boarding on flight for the first time. Will there be any problem? There won't be any problem. Brother Kuttan. If at all any problem arises, can ask to the staffs in the flight. Don't you have money and all with you? 20th October, 7:20 AM. New York to Bangalore! Eh? Who? Is your hubby, Das coming or what? Yea! Come Aju! Will reach now. When they ask the ID, should show okay. Kunju! What is it? You watch the road and drive. Aju. Aju, please slowly. Kun... jooo! Aju! Divya! Divya! I'm having a bath. Turn around please. Greetings. This.. Like the one, that I had seen and forgotten in some previous birth. Hallo mother. Shifted from ICU is it? That was good. Yes. I'm coming in flight. Mother, I will call afterwards. Meenakshi. A very nice name. Malayalee, is it? Appukuttan wants to piss. Keep quite. Appukuttan wants to piss. Appu, now it's not possible only after some more time. Mother now itself, Appukuttan wants to piss. People are watching. Mother, Appukuttan pissed! What a shame! Dude, it's Malayalee only! The dream that everyone sees in the mind. I saw that in the sky. Now, this ceremony of bride groom seeing.. That beauty, which emerged between the clouds. Wearing a sari, with wide eyes. Meenakshi. Liked! I liked a lot! Father. Shobha, here only. We were searching for you all over the ICU. Was shifted to the room today morning. How do you feel now, Brother Vasu? Feels better. Made me breathless! Brother, for some time you don't go get into any manual work. There are people to do that. Now he is also here. When did you arrive, son? This morning. Divya and Arjun, had send him on a flight. That is why he reached so early. When Das left for USA I told Divya not to remain there alone. Will she listen, on saying? Now what Kuttan and Aju says, she will listen only to that. That Aju, is there that is my main worry. A brash fellow! He has got no job or anything. Aju is a specialist of bikes and old vintage cars. He has got many good clients in Bangalore. Specialist indeed! Too bad. A colonel's son is a mechanic. It is not surprising why Balettan doesn't come to native place. Even before his father and mother never looked after him. My God, it's Geeta, she was calling for a long time ago. Hallo. At America, it's night. Yea, sister one minute. That Aju, is piling on him! Let that be whatever. Sister, it seems brother's planetary position is not good. Is it? It came in TV in this week's prediction. No, no problem. Not necessary, that sister should come. I'll manage. Okay, then. Vasuettan, is worried about Kuttan. At the earliest a good girl should be found for him. Let him at least live peacefully, Shantha. Look, the doctor has told not to talk too much. On the other day, I had told that to Divya, to find it. To know which kind of girls does he like. Yea, God will bring good one from somewhere. Divya. Are you coming out with me for dinner? Lovely place. Dinner was good is it not? Was splendid, is it not? Divya, I need to pack. How poised... How refined... Real Malayala grace. That is how girls should be. Who? Your air-hostess? I took return flight hoping to see Meenakshi. But I didn't see her. Should have just come by bus. Say, should have taken the phone number. Hey, that is all too bad! What happened? A kind of mood off. It is because her chap has left for Mysore. Brother Das came and went already? Didn't know that. There he goes, here he comes. What did he bring you from America? Mmm... Chocolates. Chocolates! Chocolates? Too bad! That is given to the neighbor's kids, is it not? Is it so? Will anyone give chocolates to wife? Shall we go? What had happened to her? Some issue is there. Completely in bad temperament. Other day on meeting at the flight. I'm sorry, name? My name is Krishnan PP. Everyone used to call Kuttettan. "By applying collyrium in the eyes" Meenakshi. That's not required! They are my cousins. Arjun and Divya. So you are all Bangalore based is it not? Yes, I'm working here at Systo. Where are you staying? Then we are neighbors. Just tell the mobile number. The number is..Number is.. He is giving her the number. Yes. It's.. What number? Is this the Malayali grace? A traditional beauty. Watch and learn, you girl! Go man. Came with my colleagues for a shopping. So Kuttettan... Or just cute Kuttan. Anything is fine. Cute Kuttan? First I thought Meenakshi is not a Mallu. Half Malayali, dad is Punjabi Mom is from Palaghat. Okay. I'll call now. Save the number. Okay, very well then. "By applying collyrium in the eyes" "Applying marks on the fore head" "Malayali lady moved" Oh! My sir. "Oh! Butterfly lady! Aren't you yearning to see me in person?" "Has come The lady whom I'm to wed" "On the cheeks there indeed is a piece of glass" "On the lips there indeed is blushing lips" "Like the blue sea She has a lovely eyes" "The hair, even the dark clouds will fail, has a traditional charm" "Will take you there, lady" "During the festive season of Onam" "The eyes and the heart, lady" "At the time, when you see" "Like the golden lotus" "The nectar dipped flower is also the heart" "With the stars The lady is in company, long back" "Like the morning birds Coquettes in the ears" "Like that.." "Spreads in the world Sweet shrilled words" "The flowers that blossom in the chill" "Covers the heart with the smile" "Ho!" "The very thought on her" "It will start to rain" "Ho, ho!" "Beloved, take a look at this" "Ho!" "Till this time" "For her..My..." "...Mind is throbbing" "Oh! Always my beloved" "You take a look" Where were you, man? On switching off the phone whole night where did you go? Along with Meenakshi. Where? At Meenakshi's apartment. What was the job overthere? Aju, any news? Yea, has come, you and I simply got tensed. On going, telling will come just now. Whole night, he was in Meenakshi's apartment. What? Are the things going out of hand? Who? This guy? Might have talked something and sat there. Is it not Kuttoos? Not only talking, okay. Hey! Kunju bye. Hey man, tell! We both.. You both.. Were playing song game. Damn it! "In a sweet dream jasmine flower bloomed" Is the road your father's property? Come. Divya! Should never repeat this. Have gone with my cousins is it not? Your cousins are bunch of idiots with no knowledge. Understand what I'm saying. Because of those idiots only, I'm still staying here. Otherwise I would have become mad, very long back. When I called, you didn't pick up the phone. That is why, I canceled my trip in the mid way and came back. Do you know that? Why did you call? The routine was only to send the mail, is it not? So does that mean that I shouldn't attend any thing? I'm only used to that. You will come and go as you please. Only I should do everything exactly. I just can't. Got fed up! Whatever I do it is a fault. But never talks in Malayalam. Why is that? Let that be. But India is a democracy is it not? So to speak ones own language everyone has got the rights, is it? Without talking Malayalam I'm not going to leave you. Friend, it's a question of being chucked out from the job. So kindly spare me. Come like that. If at all whenever we meet directly... ...at any cost we will talk in Malayalam. Is it okay? Used to do lot of things. But today's surprise will be the best. Whom are you surprising? What if I come and see Sarah, now. Riya give that paper. Did you hearthis? A real mad guy. Yea, at times. But no one has taken it this far. Told will come and enter and all. Kutta, I'll call you afterwards. So, you are a Malayali, is it not? It's been many days you are after me. No. I'm asking why are you following me? No, I haven't followed. Then, how come I, see you on the bus I, travel... ...at the cafe, at the school? I, was following that girl. For what? Just because she is cute. You think you can follow her? Not like that. Then like what? Hey, what happened? What is there to happen? If you want, you can join yourfriend also. I'm not going to leave you without talking Malayalam. But today's surprise will be the best. Sarah, are you sure you don't want anything? So, Arjun, have you called to my show? Not me. So you were not the one who said you'll walk into the studio, right now? Is it? Leave me! I must go inside! Hey, go and sit there. Why are you standing here? Simply. Sit. Did you like it? A little tea please? Kuttan, could you get the door please? Who is it Kuttan? Karan, what did you do to him? So, you were inside is it not? Hey, Meenakshi no need! "If you were beside me" "I simply thought like that, for a second" "I simply thought like that, for a second" Kutta, forget about this music game and all. Didn't you know that from the start...? This won't be a happily ever after type of story. Then, what is there in it? What is this, happily ever after? Happily ever after! Now, I know. To tell the truth... ...this real love is like a Santa Claus. Everyone will say. Santa Claus, had come and seen and all. Will also dress up like him. Have anyone seen the real Santa Claus? Have you seen? How many drinks he has had? Four, what? Cola. Simply for an effect. But that is not the thing. My sorrow is not thinking about a girl, Aju. But on thinking about you. On thinking only about you. Why is that? Kunjoos, do you know? Our Aju's innocence is lost, long ago. Gone! Where to? No, nothing is there. Kutta! No! I must say. Aju, let the world know that. That is a loss, an irreparable loss, is it not? Look Meenakshi! If you are going to get late, why can't you call and say that? You should have thought about it, before throwing the phone. Don't you have anything to do other than follow me? Ratherthan following you... I, like to walk along with you. Where is the cute cousin? You want gum? "In whichever dark night" "Will, stitch a small golden streak" "Oh! The rays of light" "On these doors of the heart..." "...please, come flowing through the tiny holes" "Beside me..." "...like a new red flowertree" "You bloomed..." "Feeling covetous to hug..." "...on these early dawns" "On that day, from somewhere..." "...is your golden feather shinning?" "Is one among them grazing my heart's brim" "I was awakened" "In whichever dark night" "Will, stitch a small golden streak Oh! The rays of light" "On these doors of the heart..." "...please, come flowing through the tiny holes" Why? Army! Yes. What happened? Never used to entertain army people or what? I was not entertained by Colonel Balachandran. Father! "May be, you will be..." "...the imagination of my soul" "Why is this talking? Without talking" "When there was no thought within me..." "...you came" "Like the changing of curtains..." "...the memories" "My beloved" "You had bloomed like a flame Why is that for?" "Beside me..." "...like a new red flower tree ..you bloomed" "Feeling covetous to hug... ...on these early dawns" Without entering inside will know... ...each and every house inside this, will look similar. The same windows and doors, everything. That may be correct. But the sights seen through each and every windows of each houses. That is different. "I'm like..." "...a lonely music, my beloved" "During the time of composing the rhythm" "Like a song which is not sung..." "...you are the drop of honey" "You gave..." "Like the clear blue sky..." "...like the only one star" "My beloved..." "...one night, you had watched me from a distance" That lady has not turned up, even it is 8 o'clock. The animal! Trying to teach me. Has Chinnamma, not come? No, not come. What happened? Water stopped coming. It was there in the notice. Should have planned according to that. Forgot! Is there breakfast? The breakfast will not wake up, by it self and tell, you can eat me. Someone has to make that. Of course, now you'll go to work now. And everything back to normal, is it not? I have no time to waste on arguments like these. Then what about my life which I'm wasting here? Am I born to just make your life easy? I didn't ask anyone to do all this for me. I do my work myself and that is what I like. I don't want anyone's help. Yes. I'm the one who is a fool. I am to blame for doing everything for you. Divya! Don't shout! People will hear. Let them hear. At least now, let someone hear! What happened? This is her room. Did you know about this? Yes. When seeing for the first time, had told me about this. What? But he spoke as if everything was over. If it is like this, why did this person marry? Where is he? In office? What to say, Aju? Nothing out here.. No one is mine! I have never seen him smiling this way. Why sit in the dark? Aju, had called is it not? Yes. Call me, if there is anything. Yes, Kuttan has reached soon is it not? There is no one here. Everyone is in the ancestral house. Has instructed me to lock up everything and come. Come, we will go there. Not that what had happened brother Narayanan? So have you not come on hearing the news? The time has come to start a long journey. Search me not. I will come back. Today morning on going to give coffee, Shanta has received this. Had not mentioned anything to anyone. Not that, I, even spoke on day before yesterday. Did not say anything at that time. For the last one week. There was a religious discourse of Swami Gokulananthanji. Shantha sister used to go there everyday. Yesterday was the last day. Shantha sister compelled him to join her. Ettan heard the full discourse. It is spirituality, no. We can't say when a person will get influenced. There is no possibility of him going like that. But at the village market, they saw him board the bus... ...with some of the disciples of the Swami. Mother. Kutta, shall we inform the police? No need to inform the police and all. It is said that, father will return is it not? Kuttan. Just come here. I came to know now only. Brother Vasu has created lot of debts. One after the other lenders started coming. Now how are the things? Not only that. How can the sister in law be made to stay here, all alone? Now the things are not like when father was there. That you must think. Must take mother along with you. That is the best option. For the time being, it is only a question of locking the house, is it? No..No..Let mother remain here. Father has written that he'll be back. I'll shift back here. So that is it? What? Leaving your job in Bangalore? Job is not a big thing, uncle. Is it? Kutta! I won't go anywhere leaving mother alone. You go to that side. Did I make you a software engineer to do farming in this village? Mo..Mother! Saying that your father was a city-bred engineer... ...my family got me married to your father. Due to him I ruined my life in this cursed ancestral house. This is an opportunity to escape from this hell, my son. Please, you don't spoil that. I'm coming with you to Bangalore. Let them lock this or open this, whatever it may be. Mother! Won't father ever come back? He'll be back. Where else can he go? When he returns back, he too can join us in Bangalore? The rest of my life, should do what is required for children. He is also alone there, is it not? How long can the child remain by eating from outside? When I'm there that will be a support for him also. So, when he compelled I did not deny. Now, you all decide what is to be done. Kutta, any way that is a good decision. For you and sister, Bangalore is always better. A complete novice to the kitchen. Now you have learnt to make pancakes. The credit goes to Das. Okay. It is me who is making the pancakes. But I don't get credit. You are not even seen in the vicinity of the kitchen. That is why told like that. Does Das like your cooking? Aah! I don't know. You would need an astrologer to know what is in his mind. From the time you came... ...I've been noticing this tendency to argue back. Do you behave in the same way there also? Don't create a bad reputation. They'll say that the you were not brought up well. That is obviously the problem. The discipline and serenity... ...by obeying to everything what you told, it is like this. What is the matter, dear? You don't interfere in this, mother. What is the matter? Tell to mother, what happened? Prakasha, when you call them speak openly about everything. Hello! It is me Prakashan. Divya's father. Please listen to what I have to say. Please allow me to talk. Let me speak. Please, I... What a disgusting woman? She is not allowing me to talk. Okay, so the matter is like that now? It is you who has cheated us. Your son is having an affair with another girl. Don't make me say anything. Seems to be big American's! On telling what all things told by Divya, to them. What all things Chinnamma, had told, telling here. By the time that phone call was really like a war. So, Prakashetta, divorce is the best thing. It is you both who have to give the final decision. As generally seen. A simple problem which can be solved by talking between the 2. 20 people joined together and made it a complete mess! Daughter! Daughter, you sign on this. Daughter, we don't need this alliance. Son, what cold is this? What is this? That is Aju's only, some times Aju used to stay here. There is a heater in bathroom, mother. There is the fridge, gas and washing machine. Don't you have the other fire heath? Sorry mother, the traditional wood fire, heath is not there. Not wood fire, son. Induction. How to switch this on? On telling your father, won't allow to take the cable at all. How many channels will you get here? Here, somewhat a 100 channels will be obtained. 100 channels! Big onions! Slice it length wise, reducing the thickness. Tomato, 4 each slice it in length wise. Get out, you fellow! Hey lady...! The format to send the SMS is told here. Hey Arjun! Hey Coach So told you are going to shut down the club and all. Forget about my case... ...when I, enquired there is only 2 months to lift your ban. Coach, aren't these people enough to waste your time? Just leave me alone. Arjun, you have the potential to become a good racer. One single race is enough. Your life will change. After that big companies will take you on. Then financial security, reputation. You can get everything in one stroke, Arjun. Is it your life story, coach? It was. But I had a drinking problem. Whatever I gained I lost at one go. Arjun, time is everything. The energy you have inside you. That is your big plus. Don't waste time, Arjun. You'll regret it. Come, I'll introduce you to mother. Mama, this is Arjun. My Mama. Come, will meet the friends of Papa. What is your name? Arjun Are you studying? No. I stopped with schooling. So engaged in a job then? Job. I, fix the bikes and all, repairjobs. What about parents? Which is your native place? Around here. Did you have anything to eat? Yes, I did. Told it can be applied.. But they didn't tell like that to me. I'll take leave. No, no not like that. Don't go. The universities there, after the under graduate level. Anyone can apply. Not like what is followed in here. Yea, that is Arjun. Mama, where are the Papa's albums kept? That is, you, yourself had put it inside your cupboard. Inside it? Shall, I go and check? Will come now. Did I, keep it over there? Usually we army families lead a disciplined life. Sarah is also like that... Of lately there is some kind of change. I don't know whether you'll understand what I say, Arjun. Your back ground is a bit different, Arjun. She has got scholarship from a very good university in Australia. So we are planning to migrate there. Many parents think of a child like Sarah as a liability. But it is not like that for me. I have selected the best for, my Sarah in each and every matter. Nothing less than that Will suit my daughter. Did you get it? Yes. But I had kept it elsewhere. This is Papa's. Army training pictures. Did you see it? Look, how handsome Papa was in the uniform? What did Mama say? Doesn't all mother's say like that? Somehow? Don't know. She said you are leaving for Australia. Nothing has been decided, like that. All are saying that I'll be comfortable there. With the facilities out there. Don't know. Lot of things should be left behind and leave, is it not? Okay then. Don't simply waste time. Nothing less than that will suit my daughter. I simply called. Sir, you have become really busy or what? I was busy with some work here. Shall I call you later after finishing, all this? Oh! Yea. That's okay. Your vigor and your anger should not be shown... ...on the road or elsewhere. On the track. Remember that. Kutta! I was not in a mental state to tell anything. All these years where I lived... ...suffocating, now only I'm breathing fresh air. In between the memories and dreams... ...quite often I used to forget about the life of others. But to tell the truth.. Look, this moment that is only in our hands. To recognize that this journey was required. If this decision of mine had caused trouble to you son... ...kindly pardon this father. Will pray for you on the day of your birthday and always. Your loving father. How come a sort of smell? Where did it come from? This has come.. Looks like it's from Gaya. Kuttan's. This is not Gaya, it is Goa only. It is a special sort of smell that is found only in Goa. What are you saying, man? Chill Kuttan's, uncle is happy. Kutta! I was not in a mental state to tell anything. But all these years where I was living suffocating. Only now breathing the fresh air. As we get in to total dismay between the memories and dreams. Quite often we forget about today. But to tell the truth... ...look this moment that is only there, as our own. To recognize that this journey was required. Because of this decision of mine, it might have been troublesome to son. Kindly pardon the father. Didn't I tell? There won't be any problems to your father. What is this? Is it Sooya? I had bought that plantain stem. Are you not bored of eating that? Live as a Roman while in Rome. Mallu House is about to start. I wonder who will be driven out today. I forgot all about it. What is it? Have water. I don't know for past few days... This is hereditary. Breathlessness. Yourfather has troubled me a lot with this problem. He started having this, from the third day since our marriage. It is my fate. Now my son is also having it. On TV, Babaji has said that it is enough to do Pranayam. Breathe in and breathe out. Stop eating. I'll show you how. All these years I was leading a suffocated life. It is only now that I have started to breathe fresh air. Karthik, remove all that. Okay. Why are you dismantling everything? 'Storm Riders' are going to get revamped. New riders. New set up. Good photos. Good old days. Samy. How do you know her? She was my classmate. Natasha. Everybody was crazy about Natasha. But to her eyes, only Shiva was there. That is Shiva. He is a fool. One day, fought with her parents. On the matter of Shiva. With that departed along with Shiva. Give one cover. From there on it was their days. Shall we go? Between Natasha and Shiva. There was some sort of... ...magic was there. Careful! After the death of Natasha... No one has seen Shiva. I'll go and check. Baby Das, breakfast is kept inside go and have it. That way aunt's astrologer's prediction came true. Against the wishes of parents Divya left her parent's home. Are you not ashamed? Why did you come back. Poor baby Das. On marrying such a girl. Where is that phone? Now itself will call mother in America and tell. We will take some more time and... ...instead of taking a sudden decision. Divya! Divya! Good, that she had left. Get lost! What is she doing? On telling you going after packing everything.. ...how come you are not yet going? I'm shifting to this room. Any way had lived like roommates, is it not? From then on, that is enough. I'm not there to interfere in your matters, you don't interfere with me. Aren't you ashamed? After all this time, why are you still inside this house? Then one more thing. This mother should be thrown out today itself! How dare this girl? To talk to me in this manner. Wretch! Chinnamma, don't you want some rest? "My ember has created the dreams for you" "You don't have to see that" "You don't remain watching that" "Who are you to me?" "You don't have to tell, to anyone" "You don't have to tell the stories also" "Between us" "You don't have to hear the murmuring song" "You don't have to sing along also" "You don't have to dance along" "Simply, simply.." "To walk behind." "You don't have to ask the permission" "You don't look behind" "Without meeting the eye to eye..." "...are you seeing me?" "Can you speak anything?" "Getting wet in the eyes, is this the tear drop?" "My wish, is it you?" "In the soul, of this song" "As the pain is lingered" "You don't have to know that" "You shouldn't know anything" "But still, I'll sing" "This song is mine own" "Always mine own" I'm Natasha's friend. "Mine own" Shall we go? Wait! I have got some otherjob, you go. Didn't you tell you will drop me? Don't know whether Divya has told. Now I'm in the motor cross training. Coach Zachariah is the one training. Storm riders Sammy is the sponsor. Still now, they have got time to say about the old things. Races, trophies... ...Shiva! Natasha! Does Divya know that? She came back, on knowing that. Shall I, leave? Arjun! The race is on 27th. Do come if possible. Everyone will be there. Okay then. "The little talks in the mind" "You understood without saying" "You didn't..." "...talk anything to me" "Then when you..." "...are seen" "Within my heart" "You are the divine" "In this relationship" "As a result of that" "Without you knowing" "You have known it" "My heart" "Without knowing it" Come daughter. "You also unites" "You also unites" Daughter Geeta was saying... ...the tomatoes in America will be big as pumpkin. Brother Kuttan did you hear that? It will be having all sorts of poisons in it. Everything is made artificially. What to do? She is suffering out there. That Leelamma, is there no her servant... ...it seems that lady quarreled and left. She and Rakesh are taking leave, in turns to look after 2 children. Poor ones! On going to America, there is no change at all. A silly girl! She was saying she misses my tomato curry. Won't it be tasty, aunty, if it is made with those big tomatoes? That is what she also said. Poor aunty! Can't you send her to America? On going there, she will make others also breathless. Ho! It was son, is it not? My son. Nothing is there or what? Then what is the use of covering it? Mother. What? Nothing to eat or what? Son, today couldn't get up from here. You order one pizza, they will deliver fast, won't they? Anybody..Eating pizza. Okay, order. Son, orderfor all. My turn! Father took all these years to leave home, certain characters, like this. Take this. That stack should be chopped down next week only. Should it be chopped now? What is this going on? This is all Shoba daughter's share is it not? So, brother Prakash has sold everything. To our Mannadiyar. Many people are coming and seeing the ancestral home and going. It is heard that, it will be also sold very soon. To dear father. What is thought our own. Can't recognize anything of that sort. Why are these changes required? Can't understand anything. Which dress have you worn? There is one good news. Got the buyerto buy the ancestral home. On selling that must buy a good flat at Bangalore. I, and your father had searched a lot, is it not? So, because of that, I will demand a very good share. Then what? Can we leave just like that? That is it. Okay daughter, then. Son, what Geeta says is, everything should be demanded. Kutta! Everything around us is changing. Perishes and again reborn. So, the tides of that change will it not create ripples in us also? This is what this city is. On one side, there is a foreign girl in search of our culture. On the other side. My mother in search of modernism. Is all this made by aunty? Prepared for daughter only. Uncle what would you pray? For all our things. For everyone goodness should prevail and our sins be pardoned. Only good should happen to Divya. If I do a mistake without knowing.. If there is guilt feeling for the one who did mistake... Like me.. If it were another friend of Natasha? Who? Shiva! Do you know who he is? He is the one who killed my Naty. I know. Natasha, was everything to you. But for Shiva also it was like that. Did he tell all these stories? He cheated my daughter. Cheated her! Afterforgetting everything he might be living happily after marrying. We must go and meet Natasha's parents. Divya, I can't. For Natasha, don't we have to do at least that much? Natasha, was planning to come back. About you, people... ...always used to talk. Without me... Papa and Mummy can't do anything. Used to say. Hey! It's been very long. I was busy with the practice of the race and all. How are the things going? I called to say about the race. My main event is on 27th. If Sarah is coming, I'll arrange the tickets. 27th is it not? On 27th I'm going to Sydney. Time for me to get in to, on air. I'm not at all liking to go, by leaving you alone. But when Geeta daughter is compelling what to do? To look after her things only I'm there is it not? If your marriage is over means, I'll have peace of mind. Now, we people are all in America and you are alone in here. Mother's flight is at night today, is it not? I don't think I'll be able to marry before that. Simply some foolish attires. Can't you wear all this on reaching there? Thinks she is James Bond. Time for check in. Got the seat near the window. Mother not door, window seat. Look, will they give rice and curry inside this? All that they will give in the flight. Then what about the side curries? Doesn't matter, I like American style food. Should keep all this in your hand, till you reach near the sister. Okay? This is the boarding pass. Today are you taking the flight? No, not me mother is going. Mother! Kuttan, time for me to go. My number is not changed. Meenakshi! Kutta, one beautiful girl. What was that you both talked in between? Told some good Malayalam, what is it? Come. Will call you, okay. Okay, okay. Is everything ready, for going? Packing is going on. The flight is tomorrow only. There are lot of books. Well, now everything has to be taken. One minute. Are you coming with me? One minute okay? Sarah! Mama, I'm just going out. What are you doing? When that boy comes and calls will you go anywhere? Don't you know that tomorrow we are going? I know mother. And then are you...? ...being so irresponsible? But Mama... ...everything in my life is happening what Mama says. Must go to Australia. Must leave India. Mama, with this one evening nothing is going to change. Came fast is it? This is my Kunju! That is my Kuttan. In the world of Aju, where there is Divya and me... ...he brought Sarah overthere. Is it? On that day what we saw there is... ...answers to Aju's questions. The reasons for many of his changes. Sarah! Where are we going? That is all there. If I wouldn't have come today? If you wouldn't have come, wouldn't have seen. Then.. On doing all this, there is nothing in Arjun's mind? That's better, no. Sarah! I need to pack. The race is tomorrow is it? Arjun, It's not my responsibility to care you. I can't get defamed like this. Didn't I say I don't want children? Don't blame me! For everything, she is little different. Less than that nothing will suit my daughter. Bilal, is everything set? Bhai, everything is set. I had seen that Farhan. Where Bhai? Overthere, that is where his pit is. Das! Shiva! Man, our Shiva. Where were you man? Shiva Bhai! Where is Arjun? Arjun is overthere. Come. Aju! Let us go to the stands. Let him relax. Okay man, all the best. Today, is Farhan there for the race? At least today that fellow doesn't show any foul. What is it Aju? I must see Sarah. Sarah! Come. Hey girl! Is he going to drive? Brother Das, either me or someone else will drive the car. Put the seat beat. Look! Don't you want to go? No need to go. You are Sarah's Mama right? Yes. I'm Shiva Das. We are Arjun's family. Arjun's cousin. This is... I'm Kuttan. Arjun's cousin. They are all Arjun's friends. Like that... ...the story started with Divya, Aju, me. 3 more new people have come. Das, Sarah and now you. While keeping on talking.. Didn't know the fleeing of time. "By applying the collyrium in the eyes" Why is Michel... Not saying anything? Dear, are you not playing song game? Who told that? Aju, don't talk. Look! Brother Kuttan! Kunju you! Take one more photo, come. Look there!
