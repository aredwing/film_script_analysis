Only collateral I ever took to a bank was Dr. Smith & Wesson. So who the hell's gonna give me any cash? I need a job, Johnny. He gets every fucking cent I take in now. All the time watching him add the vig to the principal. He owns half the paper on my joint. Pretty soon, he's just gonna own the whole goddamn thing. I need back in the game, Johnny. Now, I know you're always planning a hit. I wanna bite. I need it. I can't walk this time, Johnny. I got no place to go. I'm asking you for old times. Holy fuck. We're working with him? Shit, talk about hire the handicaps. Why don't you give us all a break? Put a bag on his head. We hit them just before closing. This way they'll be tired and flushed with cash. Sounds like he's already got a bag on his head. A scumbag. Watch your mouth. Johnny knows what he's talking about on this number. Now, you just keep your goddamn ears open. Ain't you got no sense of humour, old man? I was just having a little joke. Maybe he's got another way of settling up his debts. I don't know. - Does he? - Do you? This is your deal. But I don't like it. And I don't like them. See y'all later, Romeo. It can happen. Ain't no guarantees in this line of work. Two old people got in the way. Look, I can handle this, cowboy. Now, this number has plenty of cash to go around. Everybody's gonna be happy and rich. What a bitch. What are you gonna do? Good help's hard to find. Johnny, now, I know you're doing this for me. But you're already saving my ass. You ain't gotta work it. I can handle it. I handled worse. Okay, buddy? Did you see my new watch? Well, good afternoon, sir. I was looking to buy a present for my boyfriend. I wanna get him something... I don't know, something real nice. Is he a serious collector? Oh, he ain't a serious anything. He just likes coins, you know what I mean? Remember, when we get out, sit in the back seat. Don't let Rafe get behind us. Johnny, I got something for him and the bitch... ...just in case they get smart. That is a museum piece. It don't look that old, does it? How much would a little coin like that cost? Its current value is $77,280. My God. What the hell was that? Okay, buddy. What the hell do you think you're doing? - Please... - Shut the fuck up! You're late, asshole. Let's clean the place out! Move your fucking ass, pops! Shut up and bag it, bitch! - Stupid fucker. - No! - What the fuck are you doing? - The shithead hit the alarm. - Cover the door, asshole! - Get the goods! Okay, let's do it. Come on, come get your share. Hey, I got something for you, boy. Come on, get the geek. Get that fucking geek! Yeah! Hey, fat boy, move your ass and help with these bags. What the hall happened? Where's Mikey and Johnny? They're right here, baby. Open it up. Well, they told me an old friend of mine had made the house of D again. Hell, I couldn't hardly believe it. Had to come see for myself. You know, Johnny, you ain't never been much of shit to look at. But at least up to now, you ain't been altogether stupid. And what I mean is, you'll never even touch them. You know it, and I know it. You just tell me who they are and where I can find them... ...and I'll take real good care of them for both of us. That old Mikey Chalmette... Hell, he was just like a big brother to you. You and him spent a lot of time together. Including all that hard time up there at Angola Farm. Well, I just saw Mikey down at the morgue. Poor old bastard. They really did a job on him. You got nothing on me. Deputy. Oh, Johnny, guess what the boys found down at the bus station. You probably got people feeling sorry for you... ...because you're such an ugly son of a bitch. But not me. Because I know what you are on the inside. Nothing but a cheap crook. Here's how it sits. Now, if you go to trial, they're gonna push for the whole nine yards... ...that includes murder too. Now, I ain't saying they got a case without putting you at the scene. But I am saying one thing: They got your face to show the jury. Now, with a little friendly persuasion on my part... ...maybe I can get them to lower the armed and accessory... ...for, say, a stolen properties. I don't suppose you got anybody to vouch for your character? Then it's five years. Less if you're willing to play ball with Drones. - No. - Maybe 28 months to parole... ...if you behave yourself. Now, that's the best I can do with the system here. You know how it works. I'll make a deal. Therefore, Mr. John Sedley, it is the order of this court... ...that you shall be remanded to the state penitentiary farm at Angola... ...for a term of not less than five years... ...subject to the laws and conditions as set forth by the state of Louisiana... ...and the parish of Orleans. You will be remanded over by the bailiff... ...to the proper authorities for transport. The prisoner is reminded that he is now a two-time felony offender. If, upon release, he is again convicted of a felony... ...he will be subject to a life sentence without possibility of parole. Guys that stuck you, you know what they got? A grand each in cigarettes. So it was probably somebody who thinks that murder's cheap. Maybe like the guy that just took over Mikey's bar. Cowboy named Rafe. You know this badass. You know what he did. All right, Johnny. Maybe I'll see you around, but I kind of doubt it. I don't think Rafe will mess up on you a second time. Then nobody will be getting even for Mikey. Not me. Certainly not you. Nobody. Can you hear me, John? Do you understand me? You are in the lockdown ward at St. Matthew's Charity... ...and you are back in the city now, John. I'm Dr. Steven Resher, Department of Corrections... ...and liaison to the medical community. I am not your regular doctor. I run a program that deals with reconstructive surgery. How would you like a new face? Patient may need mandibular procedure, period. However, comma, patient may benefit more... - Dr. Resher? ... from maxillary intrusion, period. - Yes. - A.Z. Drones, New Orleans Police. Yes, I see. What can I do for you? How's your patient, doctor? - Which patient might that be? - John Sedley. You know, the pretty boy. That is not a very nice thing to say. Well, he's not a very nice man, doctor. Now, how is he? Look, doc, let's not let you and me get off on the wrong foot here. I'm the case officer assigned to this boy. Any information pertaining to him is my business. Now let me ask you again. How is he? Is he going to be all right? I see. His chances of a full recovery are excellent. If you like, you may get a full report on his progress daily from the staff nurse. She gets off duty at 7. Now, if you'd excuse me, I have work to do. Goddamn. Thanks, doc. There's a theory, John... ...that surgical rehabilitation can be a deterrent to criminal recidivism. Like any theory, it needs to be validated with facts... ...statistical evidence. You won't be the first, John. But if you say yes, you will not be the last. Granted, it'll take me a while... ...but you could end up looking almost normal. Maybe even better than that. The point is, I need your consent. You know the prison rules as well as I know the prison rules. But let me assure you, I'm not talking about experimenting on you. These operations are not experiments. Do you know that they started doing these procedures on children... ...with massive cranial disfigurements some 15 years ago? These operations work, John. Now, I know that your childhood operations ended in failure... ...but this is entirely different. This will be fine surgeons... ...doing procedures that haven't been available for the last several years. Anyway, this is not an abstraction for you. You can come out of this with a normal life. This experiment is all bullshit. I'm still gonna be Johnny Handsome. I will give you a new name. I will give you a new face. I will give you new identification and a chance at a new life. They do that for witnesses. I can do that for you. If you do that... ...you got my face. This guy's deader than a week of Sundays. Told you I'd nail that geek. Yeah, ain't that just like you, baby. When you want something done right... ...you just pay someone else to do it for you. Keep up the shit, I'll ship you back to that oil-riggers' bar in east Texas... ...where I found you. I think you mean where I found you... ...knocking off gas stations for beer money. Come on, we're doing good here. We're gonna do real good at Mikey's. Sure thing, sugar. Whatever you say. We'll just wait and see what happens, huh? You wanna enhance that a little bit? Okay, the anterior portion is 5 centimetres to the left. Got it. Okay, and is he fully intubated, nurse? - Yes, doctor. - That's good. Then why don't you just remove a little tracheal pressure. - Removing. - Okay. Let's just make sure all of these lines are clear of the breathing circuit. Good. How you feeling this morning, John? Good? Okay. I know the last three weeks have been very painful for you. And you probably think that you're gonna look completely different... ...but that's not gonna happen right away. Not for a long time. All right? Let's do it. Can you open, John? Can you open? That's beautiful in there. Take a breath. That feel different inside there? - Yes, it does. - Much better resonance. Thanks to the operation, you've got the equipment now. We'll have to see if you can learn to use it. John Sedley, Sister Luke. Our speech pathologist. Hi. Mama made some lemon jam. Mama made some lemon jam. Now let's concentrate on controlling your airflow. Remember, the words are carried on air going out of the mouth. Now take a breath in. Hold it. Let it out. Mama made some lemon... Oh, shit. You know it's not easy to change the habits of a lifetime. I know how hard it is for you... ...but it can be done. It takes work, and it takes will. And if you work hard... ...someday you will speak just about as well as anyone. Mama made some lemon jam. Good. Mama made some lemon jam. Very good! Real piece a work, ain't it? Piece of work, Mr. Sedley. Piece of work. All right. What about your mother? Please, Sedley. You're making this difficult for both of us. I'm trying to fill in background for your character profile. Our records are very sketchy on you. Other than a few biographical facts... ...we don't know much about your mother. We know that she died when you were 13. Do you remember liking her? I didn't know her real good. She came some weekends to the state home... ...where they kept me at St. Brendan's. Your father? Did you know who he was? No. Your mother never discussed him to you? She didn't talk about it. Hey, I just think she was embarrassed. About your father? About him. About me. You know, I wasn't exactly her dream come true, you know. Do you remember anything special about school, John? Yeah. Carlisle. Who's Carlisle? Carlisle was this fat kid at St. Brendan's. And we all used to make fun of him, you know, because of his name. - And you wanna hear about this? - Yeah, go ahead. At Halloween, we all dressed up in costumes... ...and Carlisle, he comes over to me and he... I had this jack-o'- lantern mask on, and he rips it off... ...and he starts screaming: "Johnny don't need no mask. Johnny don't need no mask. " And all the other kids start laughing. They were all laughing. And then? I beat the shit out of him. You can write it down. No, I think that will be all for today, John. Thank you. All right, John, here we go. You just relax. Think about pleasant thoughts. It will be over before you know it. Everything's gonna be all right. Let's start counting backwards from 100. Ninety-nine... ...98... Johnny don't need no mask. Now, I know you're doing this for me. You ain't never been much of shit to look at. Put a bag on his head. I know you're doing this for me. Sounds lik e he's already got a bag over his head. A scumbag. Johnny Handsome. Go look for yourself. Well... ...what do you think, John? You people did a terrific job. But I still feel like I'm wearing a mask. If you need to see me about something... ...I have an office. You can make an appointment. Relax, doc. I'm here to see a patient. But you're leaning on my car, lieutenant. My car. How is our star? His prognosis is good. Very good. I think that you'll be very surprised at who John Sedley is right now. Yeah, well, maybe. But I tell you what I won't be surprised about: He saying he put one over on you. Are you trying to destroy my program? Are you trying to make him fail? Look, why don't you just get off his ass and give him a break? Think, lieutenant. Point number one: His mother was a prostitute and a drug addict... ...died when he was 13 years of age. Point number two: Thanks to a genetic abnormality... ...probably attributable to his mother's addiction... ...he was born with defects that 99 percent of all humanity... ...consider totally disgusting. Now... ...he has finally given himself a chance at a new life. And what does he get for that? You, just crawling all over him. Well, damn, doc, that's... That's a real sad story. Yes, it is. - Sedley? - Three ten. Well, bless my ass. Look at you. Look at you. If that don't beat all... That's amazing. That's fucking amazing. Got all that lank-ass hair now. Guess next you'll be wearing a ponytail and a fucking earring, huh? I wouldn't have made you on the street. Can you beat that? Pretty hard to believe, ain't it? I wouldn't have made your voice either. I'm real impressed. I just wonder if Rafe is gonna be. You remember Rafe, don't you? Street cowboy. He and his bitch shot Mikey. Now, you didn't forget your old friend so soon, did you, Johnny boy? I'll see you around... ...pretty boy. How'd you lik e to get out of here? I got them to approve a work release. We can find you a job. Here's the deal. You are here and locked up every night by 10:00 or it's back to Angola for you. You're gonna have to go through constant psychological evaluation... ...that I'm personally gonna handle. You'll have to answer all kinds of questions... ...with total and complete honesty, John. But if you do that for me... ...I can recommend you for parole. How do you feel about that... ...Mr. Mitchell? Well, who am I supposed to be? A Navy vet with commendations just back from overseas. You think you could put on here... ...that I worked for a while here at the hospital? Sure. We have a deal. Hi. - Can I talk to you about my check? - What's wrong with it? - Well, I think they took too much out. - That's what everyone says. - Anyway, you got the wrong desk. - Hey, mister. Give it to me. Maybe I can help. It's a crime, isn't it? I mean, how much they take out. You should take a look at my check. That'll make you feel better. Well, I don't see any problem here, Mr. Mitchell. I know what the government takes out. What about this here? You were issued work clothes, weren't you? That's a service-stat deduction. Don't expect us to pay for your work clothes, do you? So we don't have a problem. - Right, Mitchell? - No problem. He's new. He's making sure he's got his pay. He's got the right to do that. Excuse me. I just wanted to thank you for standing up to your boss. - You didn't have to do that. - I enjoyed it. He's kind of lame sometimes. Well, thanks. Where you going? - Gotta get the bus. - I got a car. I'll give you a lift. Save me from a better grade of people. That guy's so horny he can't keep his hands off the secretaries. Anyone's been there more than a week won't work for him. I'll get out of here someday. I take Thursday afternoons off. I study accounting. Yard helps me pay. Of course, it'll take 20 years to work it off. I'll probably end up an old maid. I wouldn't think that. I don't know. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. You know how it is. You work at a machine, get paid by a machine. Makes you wonder who's working for who, right? Her name's Donna. She's an accountant. A secretary in accounting? A receptionist? She want to do better, you know. She takes every Thursday afternoon off. You know, she's studying for her CPA. She got a loan from the yard, you know. She says by the time she pays it off... ...she'll probably be retired. I see. John, are you...? Are you gonna pursue this? How can I? You tell me. Hello, operator. Yeah, you got a listing for a Donna McCarty... ...over in Gretna? Okay, thank you. I've been thinking about what you told me, being in prison and all. Lot of guys would've tried to get back at the world. Or they would've given up. But you came to work, tried to be a part of life again. I admire what you're doing, Johnny. So, what about this? I'm helping steal stuff from the shipyard. This guy Earl, he works in the tool shed, I've been seeing him. He's taking stuff, machinery, equipment. You know how it is. Your guy's in trouble, you try to help. I'm changing the inventory records in the computer for him. - So why don't you stop doing it? - He'd turn me in if I stopped. He'd get busted too. What's he care? He's just a bum. He doesn't care nothing about nobody. Sometimes, there's ways... ...of working these things out. The way you say it, I almost believe you. Well, let's just say she's done some things... ...that she'd like to take back. Sure. We all have. No matter who we are. And we all need help sometimes. That's what makes us a society. People helping each other. What's the matter? Afraid of being normal? Is it so bad? Is it normal... ...to forget where you come from? Of course not. Can't do that. Hey, Earl. - Who are you, man? - I'm a friend of Donna's. I just wanted to talk to you about a few things, but it's personal. He's probably gonna ask my permission to check under her skirt. That it, man? You sweet on my Donna? Looking to get a little? Look, Earl, we got a problem. You gotta stop making Donna cook the books. It's getting out of hand. She's taking too big a chance... ...and you're getting small-time stuff. - Hey, buddy. I don't like the way this conversation's going, all right? Now, maybe you ought to butt out of Donna's business. - And mine. - Look, Earl. Donna's a good kid. I don't know why you'd wanna fuck her life up... You stupid shit. What? You didn't hear me? Maybe I should fuck you up or... - Hey, hey, hey. - Be smart, Earl. Okay. All right, all right. Come on, man. - Don't know what you're fucking with. - Okay, man. You could get killed. Now, you asked Donna her last favour, right? Right, okay. - Don't let me down, Earl. - All right. Don't let me down. This girl, does she know about your previous condition? No, I didn't tell her. Oh, it's only natural to test her. If she were the right girl for you, she'd pass the test. You know, whatever happens to me... ...I just want you and Dr. Resher to know... ...I think this program that you have here, it's really good. And I think it would be really good for a lot of other people. You're a big part of it. - Yeah. - And I wish you the best, Johnny. Thanks. You don't got anything to worry about. You doing great at work. You look like a great guy, at least I think so. Got a girl that believes in you. How could they not give you parole? I got a good feeling. I think it's gonna be okay. You know, all them cons I was on the inside with... ...they believed that too. All them cons with their big plans... ...nine out of 10 times, they'd be back on the inside. Hey, I'm not so sure that you can count on me. I'm not so sure that I'm what you want. I'm a big girl. I don't need you to tell me what I want. I know what I want. You know what I like best about your face? I like your eyes. Well, Johnny, they bought your whole load. Hook, line and sinker. Y'all think it'll be a new world out there with his new name and his new face. - Like he was born again. - Well, one thing for sure. From now on, Johnny's world is gonna be what he makes of it. You know, Johnny... ...you might fool this fucking quack and little sister over there... ...but I know you. I know who you are, and I know what you are. And we both know right where you're going, don't we, Johnny? I'm in love, sweetheart! Hey, Sunny. How are you doing? - Do I know you? - Yeah, sure. A long time ago. You probably forgot about it. Try me, baby. Is Rafe around? No. You know Rafe. Same old shit. Yeah? Yeah, the two of you make a hell of a pair. Why don't you give me a hint, baby, help me remember who you are. It'll come to you. - Buy me a drink? - Sure. You and Rafe both. I don't make his dates, and he don't make mine. You got some nice hands, sweetheart. I'd remember those. Well... ...l'll see you around, huh? You and your boyfriend. Now, wait just one second, sugar. I'm kind of getting a feeling about you. Well, it gets better. And richer. A lot richer. Why don't you hold on one minute, I'll go see if I can locate him for you. - There. That's him. - I don't know this guy. I don't know. Something about him. Feels like money. Yeah, yeah, you're an expert on that. At least I'm an expert on something, fucking loser. If you don't like it, go down there and wait cocktails... ...and get your ass goosed by the tourists. Or go back to selling it for 100 bucks a pop. The price was 1000. Either that or I gave it away. Somebody wants to meet you. I'll be out front. Who are you, buster? John Mitchell. Is that supposed to mean something to me? Looking for a handout, or you gonna hit me up for something special? - I just wanna give you some money. - For what? - Your help. - What kind of help? A job. A 5-million-dollar job. Let's have a talk about it. He can't get 5 million nothing. Shut the fuck up and drive, Larry. It's a payroll heist. - The Commodore Shipyard. - That's your hit? Where you been? They make boats, not money. Hey, man, they got 10,000 workers. They pay bimonthly, in the millions. They got auto tellers all over the shipyard, dozens of them. These fuckers spit out 20s, 50s, 100s. If any of this is bullshit, it's nothing to me, I'll kill you. There's two armed guards inside. Here and here. And a couple of clerks. We hit them right after lunch. Sounds okay to me, baby. If this deal is so damn hot, why come to us? Well, I'm new around here. I don't know anybody else. You don't know me, buddy. Sure, I do. You and Sunny both, from the Prestige job. - Bullshit. What do you know about it? - Shut up, you stupid fuck. I know about the Prestige job... ...from Johnny Handsome. I don't think you know what you're messing with. Look, I was working at the prison hospital... ...when Johnny Handsome checked out. - You can call Personnel. - Yeah, is that so? Well, if you know so much about it... ...what are you gonna trust me and Rafe for, huh, baby? I can't do the Commodore alone. I need somebody to work the stash, and I need a skirt inside. Hey, that 5 million goes pretty good three ways. Yeah, it's a big job, but how do I know you know what you're doing? Hey, pal, I handled a few jobs before I was in the Navy. You can check that out too. This is a one-time offer. Y'all think about it. I'll tell you when I tell you. What are you, some big shot? Go check him out. I always figure that everybody's looking for some kind of angle. I knew it right from the first second you and I started talking. Can't really put much over on me... ...so it didn't surprise me much when it turned out... ...you had yourself a little number in mind. I'll tell you, sweetheart. Looking at you gives me some bad thoughts. I'll keep that in mind. It ain't just you I'm talking about. I think we both know who I'm discussing. And he just better watch out... ...or something might come around and bite his old ass. See, the bastard stiffed me on my cut from Prestige. Stuck it all in that shithole bar of his. He'll do this, all right. Well, it sounds like you know what you're talking about. Oh, I know a thing or two about old Rafe. And I know something about you too, baby. I know where you're gonna be in about 10 minutes. You know, honey, I hate to argue with a man... ...after he's been so nice to me... ...but you were wrong about one thing. When it comes to money, there ain't never enough to go around. Like that old Prestige job should've set me up for a long time. But Rafe held out on me. Fuck. I guess he just don't know how to take care of a good thing once he's got it. I bet that you would take care of things a whole lot better. Well, what do you say, sugar? Or do I have to ask you twice? You know, usually when I treat a man that good... ...he seems a whole lot happier about it. Now, see, you and me... ...we cut Rafe out. Oh, I bet that the two of us could go a long, long way together. I bet you've already got a plan. Because you know something, sweetheart? Two goes into 5 million a whole lot sweeter than three. Pretty. And you certainly look like a nice girl. Now let's talk about your boyfriend. You probably know him as John Mitchell. Yeah, I see him sometimes. Probably not lately, though. Am I right? Well, I don't think my private life is any of your business. Well, thanks for your time. Sir, did something happen? Why are you here? Oh, no. Just routine. You know he's trying real hard. It isn't easy for him. Bless my soul. You really are a nice girl. Johnny, can I talk to you? Yeah, sure. What do you need? I don't see you, I don't hear from you for days. Now, a cop comes around right at work in front of everyone... ...asking questions about you. What did he want? He wanted to know what our relationship is. Was that it? Yeah, that's it. What's going on? Look, I've been meaning to tell you. You're a nice girl and all, but just... It ain't gonna work out with me and you. - I got too many problems. - Save the bullshit. You know, I ran you in the computer. It never shows you were in jail, just an honourable discharge from the Navy. What the hell's going on with you? Hey, look, don't you get it? I just don't wanna go out with you no more. To hell with you. I don't know you, Mr. Mitchell. - Yeah, I know. - Well, what can I do for you? Well, I'm new here... ...and everybody in town says you're the man to see. Yeah? About what? A laundry service. Could be 5 million worth. That sounds illegal. It is. You looking for hardware? You've come to the right place. Three hundred, and it's clean. We got the new number-one baby right here. Nine millimetre. Semi-automatic. Austria. Make it plastic so it don't freeze up in them mountains they got. You going someplace cold? - Yeah. - Johnny, it's me, Donna. I'm sorry to barge in, but I had to talk to you. I didn't wanna leave it the way we did. Well, and I told you it ain't happening with me and you. I don't believe that. Earl told me what you did. You had to feel something or you wouldn't have done it. Can I come in? None of this makes any sense, Johnny. You hold a knife to Earl's throat, then you're trying to get rid of me. I got the cops coming to work asking me questions. You're a good person, Johnny. I just wanna know what the hell's going on. This is me. Johnny Handsome. What are you talking about? Who is this guy? They killed my friend. They sent me to jail and they put a knife in me. That's my debt. Johnny, if this is really you... ...I can't understand everything you've gone through... ...but now you got a chance at something here. You got a shot at a better life. You can't just throw that away. You don't understand. I mean, you just... You don't understand anything. So why don't you get out of here. - Johnny. - Go on, get out of here. - I said, get out of here. - Please, let me help. Go on, get out of here, get the fuck out of my life! Goddamn it, Johnny, don't do this to yourself. Here's to us, babe, back at it tomorrow. Yeah, right. I put on the wig, take all the chances... ...you put on a mask, take all the money. You get your cut. Just like last time, huh, sugar? Let me tell you something, Sunny. Don't bet on this new guy. I know you got eyes for him... ...but he's a loser. I can smell it. And I'm gonna take him out big when the time gets right. I know we don't get along much anymore, baby... ...but we're still connected. We got time in together. That's like an investment. You don't walk out on it. Don't think about things, cowboy. You ain't a thinker. How you doing there? Dumb fuck. Mr. Bonet, may I speak to you for a minute? - Yeah. - Well... - In private, if it's okay. - Where? I don't know. Your office, I suppose. - Now? - Yeah. Won't hurt a bit. Let's do it. No fucking off, no backing up. Just stick to the plan, okay? Now, what is it you wanted? Turn off the alarm. You gotta be kidding. You stupid fuck. You think I won't shoot you? Now turn off that fucking alarm. There. I did it. It's done. - Now please... - Shut the fuck up! What are you doing? - Drop the gun! - I'll blow your fucking head off! - Get down, goddamn it! - Get down. Get down, you stupid... - All of you, goddamn it. Get down! - Get down! Down! Put... Put your hands... Drop that phone! What the fuck are you looking at? Get down, you useless piece of shit! Down! Move it! Move it! Get down! Down! Let's go! Yeah. What the fuck is this shit? What am I, your fucking maid? Larry, move your fucking ass and stash these now. Move it, before somebody gets here. Everything cool? Yeah, perfect. Real pretty. Your plan worked real good, buddy. You know, I think you and I should drive around. We'll hook up with you guys later. Well, shit, they'll be looking for four and not two. Yeah, I'll stay with the money. Then we'll meet up later. How sweet it is. Fuck, we played him great. - I'm taking off. Alone. - What? - You heard me. - What is this shit about? Hey, baby, you and me, we had ourselves a little plan, remember? I'm going to the laundry to clean the money... ...otherwise, it doesn't do anybody any good. Sure thing, sweetie. I'll see you at the cemetery across from the Orleans at 9. Fucking whore. You helped him make the switch. You see me with any money, genius? He had a gun on me, what was I supposed to do? Oh, come off it, okay? You think I'd come back to this shithole if I had any part of those millions? Son of a bitch! We really ate it, didn't we, baby? Quit feeling sorry for yourself. I don't know how it started. Suddenly, there was a man... ...with a mask and a gun. I never had a chance. I might've could of handled the situation... You're a little far from home, ain't you, A.Z.? Really interesting case you got here, Monte. Just thought I'd take a peek. Just looking at the serial numbers on them stolen bills. Shit, they all consecutive. You can look as much as you want to, but this is our business... ...and we don't want no help from out-of-parish. Well, shit, Monte... ...I know y'all good old boys don't need no help from the likes of me. My compliments. A very professional piece of work. As you might know... ...l've been involved in a lot of jobs. Usually it's after the fact, however. And this... ...this reminds me of another job a while back. Three men made the hit, plus a driver. Three men in masks, as a matter of fact. Plus a girl for distraction. Oh, I ran a check on you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clean. So clean. But a friend of mine down at precinct tells me that Lieutenant Drones... ...is interested in you. Lieutenant Drones is the man who investigated the Prestige. And Rafe is pulled in on the job. Now, that's an interesting coincidence, huh? Beautiful. Truly beautiful, Johnny. Johnny Handsome. My compliments to the surgeons. I guess you could've shot Rafe already, huh? But that wouldn't be enough. - Too easy. - Yeah. You wanna put him through the whole dance. Mikey would have liked that. Look, I'll be at the Orleans Hotel downtown. Get it done by 9. Yeah, Lewis? I got it. Yeah, all of it. Lewis, I told you. I told you I gotta get out of there by 8 p. m. On the dot. Now... ...is everything okay on your end? Well, bless my ass. Boy, you got it pulled tight in here. Goes double for your face, counsellor. I can't imagine why you're looking like that. Johnny, are you there? Johnny, tell me you didn't have anything to do with... Sure, baby, and I'm queen of the Mardi gras. Goddamn it. Son of a bitch! Rafe! Now, does that look like anybody you know? God! Hell, we thought our little pal wasn't gonna show up tonight, huh? Hold it right there, Johnny! Turn around, face the wall. Face the wall. I imagine you were expecting someone else. Yeah, when I saw the money was serialed... ...I knew a good pro like you wasn't gonna leave an untidy trail. Got me to thinking: "Who would old Johnny Handsome trust to launder all that money? Especially with Mikey gone. " You should've seen Vic's face when I walked in. That boy is no hero... ...I can tell you that. You know, in a way, it's too bad I didn't show up just a little bit later... ...after you'd settled up with them. So... ...why don't I give you 10 minutes. So I can get them? And you can take me in? Or they get me, and you take them in? And the money. But I figure at least you'll be happy in your cell... ...knowing you pulled the trigger on them scumbags. Is that the money? All pretty and clean? Yeah, it's payoff time. I guess that laundry shrunk it down into one bag, huh? There's plenty to go around. Where's Sunny? Hate for her to miss out on all the fun. What kind of fun you have in mind, geek? Huh, geek? Once a geek, always a geek. Hey, freak, did you really think you were gonna get even with me? Larry! Now you put down that gun... ...and maybe we'll let your honey keep breathing. Get the geek's gun, Larry. You got a real nice face now, don't you, Johnny? But I think I liked it better the old way. Yeah. And I think I can help you get it back. Oh, no! No! Go ahead, Rafe, show him what you're made of! Stop it! - No! - Baby, show him what you're made of. You go ahead, baby. Your boyfriend don't look so good now, does he, sugar? Yeah, go on, take a look at him. Go on! Go on! Get him in his face! Get on his fucking face! Oh, no. No. You ain't the boss now, are you, baby, huh? Stop it, please. - Oh, no! - Slice his fucking face, yes. - Yes, do it. - Fucking geek. You thought you were gonna kill me? I'm gonna fix you up real good, Johnny Handsome. - In Jesus' name, no, please. - Don't fucking kill him yet. I get to do that. Now go look and see, is that money all there? What's the combination? Just don't hurt her. You're not calling the shots here. What's the goddamn combination? Two, six, one. Two, six, one. Shit. You must think I'm some kind of dumb shit. You got this thing rigged to blow up in my face, don't you? No. Is that how you expect to get me? I ain't falling for this shit. You open it. Come on, you open it. Open it, goddamn it, or I'll kill you and the bitch. Open it, goddamn it, now. Quit stalling, geek. Your ass is mine now, sweetheart. Now, why don't you just start handing over that money. Come on, you fuck, let's see what you got! Nice work. Nice work. How do I look? How's my face? Well, Johnny... ...that damn doctor didn't understand this part... ...did he?
