Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday, Angeliki! Philippos, come over here. Take a picture of us. This one. Come on. Myrto, come over here! Mom, I'm pregnant. Are you sure? Happy birthday! Let's take a group shot. Come on, leave it for now. Let's take a family shot. Alkmini come over here. Where's Angeliki? We understand what you're going through. Our agency is here because you need support. Thank you. To your knowledge, did she have problems at school? Did she not want to go? She was a good student. Did she have trouble with a schoolmate or perhaps a teacher? No. Do you know that or are you just assuming? I don't know... Did you notice any strange behaviour? Did she stay in her room a lot? Not wanting to see anyone. No. - Did she cry for no reason? - No. Did she have nightmares or wake up in the night? No. - Did you scold her often? - No. Never. I'm afraid we must look into ...the possibility of child neglect. What do you mean? I don't understand... She didn't have any problems. It was her birthday, she was very happy playing with her brother and sister when... The balcony railings are very safe. This is just a formality... ...that Welfare observes in such cases. We'll come to your house and make sure you're okay. Eleni, come on, please. Eleni. It'll do us good to sit together at the table. Come on. Eleni. Please help me out here. Come on. So you don't want us to sit together at the table. You don't want us to look after each other. So where were you yesterday? And you? And you? And you? Where were you all? But forget about them. Where were you? How could you let this happen? Tell me. Let's go to bed. Why did you let them talk to me like that? Go back to sleep. Come in. - How are you? - All right. Here are her things. You didn't have to bring the kids in today. The whole class is very upset. You're right, but I thought it would do them good to get out of the house. You know, there are a lot of rumors going around. Angeliki hung out with older kids, along with your daughter. One of them is bragging that she committed suicide for him. I don't think so. It's dangerous for the children. - What's this? - It's about a job. They said you should call them by four o'clock. Better not go today. Stay home. Why were you quarelling? She doesn't want to go to school. I know. And where's Eleni? At the police station. Myrto! Come here! What did they want? I went to get the death certificate. We have to take it to the Registry Office. Today. Was Welfare there? No. What took you so long? Good morning. You'll have to declare the death to all services involved. ID card, please. This is the last month you'll be getting the child benefit You'll lose 170 euros due to her death. I understand. Thank you. Lena had other toys, but neither she nor the other kids had ever seen such a doll. She lived in a place where no one had more than the other. Come help me. Keep reading on your own. Eleni. Here's the bus ticket. Put it in the back seat. You will earn 530 euros for a 5-day week. Full time. Plus social security, of course. You can start today, so you can see what you're supposed to do. Certainly. At your service. Thank you for this opportunity. Your contract is for 4 months. If they subsidize social security again next year... ...for the unemployed over 50, we'll rehire you. Thank you. Grandpa's got a new job. If you finish with your homework... ... we can go for a walk in the park and wash the car. I miss her too. But you have to try harder. For the children. - Is there something she needs? - No. Hello? Yes, just one moment. Hello? Can I go to her house? Be back before dinner. Grandpa, I'm done. What shall I do now? Do your exercise. One tree, two trees, three trees, four trees, five trees... ...nine trees... eleven trees. Grandpa, I'm tired. Keep going. One tree, two trees, three trees,four trees... ...seven trees... ...ten trees... Until you finish, your sister will remain standing there. Absolutely still. Twenty trees, twenty-one trees... ...twenty-five trees... Twenty-six trees... ...twenty-nine trees... ...thirty-three trees... ...fourty-one trees... ...fourty-five... - Grandma, I'm hot. - And I want to wear a skirt. Be quiet. This is what you're wearing. - Can I come in? - Please do. I told your father I couldn't make it to the funeral. - My mother was sick. - That's okay. Have a seat. - I brought some cookies for the kids. - Thank you. We're all in shock. It must be very hard for you. If it were me, I would have lost my mind. Have a drink. Calm down. Stay strong, Eleni. I'm here if you need me. Thank you. Sit down. Don't get up. My daughter's afraid to go out on the balcony. I keep telling her: "look how high the railings are. You can't fall." How's your mother doing? She might need to come live with me so I can keep an eye on her. She suffers from dizzy spells. We're going for tests again tomorrow. I see. Which means my daughter won't be going to school tomorrow. I should get going. My daughter's all alone at home. Are you done? I need to come in. Come and play. Come on. Philippos. Philippos. I said come and play. Did you have a good time? You didn't bring me any flowers. You should bring them to mom first, then to grandma. Grandpa took Philippos to pee and they picked them. Then they gave them to me in the car but I gave them to grandma because I didn't want them at all. Are you sure? And why didn't you want them? We don't give presents away. You're being ungrateful. Now see what you've done. You've upset him. Go give him a kiss. Can I try? Not like that, Grandpa, you'll lose. Grandpa, can I tell you something? After dinner. Tonight you will sleep alone. And where will Myrto sleep? Good morning. I'm taking the kids to school. Eleni said you're taking your mother to have tests done I thought it would be a shame for your daughter not to go to school. Thank you so much for thinking of me. But her father came by... ...and picked her up yesterday. I hope I haven't made you late. I wanted to thank you for visiting. I hope it wasn't too tiring. You know, Eleni isn't very well. Don't worry. I understand. If you noticed anything, I'd like to know about it. I'm afraid Eleni keeps it all bottled up inside. That makes sense. It's still too soon. I agree. I must hurry, or else the children will be late. Thanks again. Good day to you. Good day. You were late. I would prefer that it not be repeated. I'm very sorry. I can't pick up the kids. You'll have to do it. I've left tickets for you in the first drawer. Don't lose track of time. The bell rings at 2 o'clock. Be there at 1:40. At 2:30 I'll call you at home. Don't let me down. Bravo. You make sure it's cut evenly. Your father will call. Go and play in your room. Open the door. You're grounded. At least let me use the phone. Mom! No. Open up! So now what? Are you going to leave me here to die? Put that down. Yes. We're right here. I just didn't get to it in time. What happened? Nothing happened. - How did it go? - Okay. - Everything all right? - Yes. Yes. Have the children had their bath? They're just about to. In this house we have nothing to hide. It's bath time. Let's go. Ready. Your turn, Phillippos. Can I have one? Here you are. Give me another one. Why are you here? I'm here to see my gynecologist. With your husband? No, with my father. I think it's your turn. Do you want me to come in too... ...to hold the door for you... so no one else comes in. Go ahead. Eleni, come along. Is everything all right, doctor? Everything's fine. Your wife will have to watch her blood sugar. She's obviously given birth before, so you know the drill. I'm her father. The baby's father abandoned us. I'm sorry. Why don't you go on the pill? Welfare will judge you about Angeliki. They can take your children away. It's the mother who's responsible for the child. That's what they'll say. And you must persuade them. I will persuade them. I swear I will! - Did you open the door? - No! - Let's go play. - Play? Tonight? Yes, tonight. Good morning. I'm sorry, but I can't come into work today. I realize that's a problem, but it's the last day of school... ...and I must go and get the children's report cards. Their mother is still sick. I assure you I'll make it up. But don't you understand? It can't be avoided. Please, sir. Do you have a family? Of course it's your prerogative. I'm just saying... Very well then. As you wish. I won't come back to work. Thank you very much. Good day. Grandpa, isn't Grandma getting up? Grandma's asleep. She's sick. She's got migraines again. The slightest noise causes her pain. That's why she has to stay in her room with the door closed. No one must disturb her. I have to go now. You kids look after Grandma. You're old enough now. I want you to respect her and help her around the house. If it's our game that's to blame, Grandpa I won't ask her to pretend to be a monkey again. It's not your fault. Grandma's had this problem for years. Good morning. Eleni wasn't feeling very well. Is it okay that I came alone? No problem. How is she doing? It's hard for her. She doesn't want to see anyone. You can tell her that the kids' grades are excellent. I'm glad. Philippos' and Alkmini's. It's very important to us. I'm amazed they've remained unaffected by the accident. Only Philippos has become a little more unruly. What do you mean? He's caused some problems in class. He can be aggressive at times. Aggresive? Yes. But not to worry. It's only natural after what happened. I'm surprised. He's very quiet at home. But I promise you I'll have a chat with him about it. Come over here. Do you see what you accomplish when you're good kids? If you keep listening to me you'll always get perfect grades. But let's see how you do next year, when school will be harder. Because it seems to me you don't always listen to what I say ...and that makes me very sad. I'm not done yet. Go to your places. Not you, Philippos. So are you're a tough guy, eh? Not so talkative now, are we? Alkmini, come over here. Slap him! Don't feel sorry for him. Do you like it? What kind of a man are you, that you let girls hit you? I want to talk to you. You'll spend all day on the sofa. The table is only for family. In the afternoon we're going to the beach. Thank you, Grandpa. But first you'll clean the house. Take your mother her lunch. I kept calling you but you didn't pick up. I wanted to see if you were okay. You know me. I don't like to talk. It was tough for me at home. I have a problem. I need your help. There are no secrets between us. Speak freely. Eleni is pregnant. Again? She wants to keep it But again she won't say who the father is. I'm afraid we'll get into trouble with Welfare. I thought maybe you could help. - How? - You only need to sign your name. Here's your coffee. I'll go get the cookies. - It's not easy, you know. - I can give you a little money. I'll never cause you any trouble. Rest assured. I never doubted it. You know there's nothing to worry about. And you'll have whatever you want from me. I'm a man of my word. There's plenty of time, isn't there? Yes, yes, sure. Can I go out for a bit? Where to? My friend. - Go ahead. - Will you give me 5 euros? What do you want the money for? You're just going to your friend. Nothing. We're going to the beach. Don't you want to come along? I got my period. Really? When? Just now. Grandpa! Will you take us to the beach? It's too late now. But you promised. Tomorrow. When you have your new bathing suits. Don't open it. Tomorrow, at the beach. Come with me. Mom Grandpa said he'd buy me a new dress for doing well in school. We will buy it together with your Mom. Say thank you to Mommy. Thank you, Mommy. Off to bed now. Let's go. Get ready. I don't want us to be late. Filippo. If I see you with him again don't bother coming home again. - Hello there. - Good evening. She's beginning to show. Let's have a drink. Thank you. Here you go. Come on Eleni, dance. Yes, yes. Let me do it. Never mind. I apologize. We'd better go. There's no need. Now. Thank you so much. Thank you. For the kids. Next time we'll have more fun. Why aren't you asleep? - I lied to him. I didn't - I don't want to know... You never want to know anything. Do you know what they're saying about Angeliki at school? Do you see this? This? So be quiet. That's also your fault. It's all your fault! You drank one of his beers. You'll say you drank it. Grandpa, aren't we going shopping? In a little while, Alkmini. Be careful. Don't get your clothes dirty.. - Good morning. - Welcome. Good morning.. We were here twice before, but no one came to the door We were probably out. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - What's your name? - Alkmini. - And yours? - Philippos. - Please fill this out. - Certainly. Through there are the kids' rooms. Where did Angeliki sleep? In the other room. She slept here. With my youngest daughter, Myrto. Who is... fourteen years old. Where is she now? At school. Unfortunately, she couldn't be here. She has exams. - Angeliki's things? - I've put them away. I didn't want the kids to have to look at them. It was too upsetting. Please, sit down. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Are you done? - Yes. Philippos and Alkmini, can you go to your room please? Have a seat. You haven't filled out the income. Which family members work? For the time being, just me. I'm an accountant. I have a few clients. And Eleni's looking for a job. We do what we can, you understand. You say here that all the children, including Angeliki were ...of unknown father. Was the father the same person? You mean you don't know the name of any of the fathers? Eleni had run away from home to be with the kids' father. He never recognized them. Eleni is somewhat ashamed. Why did you run away? Your parents seem very understanding. I was very young. And in love. I didn't know what I was doing. Daddy forgave me as soon as I came back. Mom too. She was already helping me secretly. She still helps with the kids. And dad of course. He drives them to and from school every day. He takes good care of them. The kids love him very much. How do you spend your day? Can we offer you something? Thank you. Yesterday? What did you do? I went and had my hair cut, and then for a walk. Dad insisted. And the day before? My best friend came to see me. She's a neighbor. She has a little girl, Alkmini's age, Marina. Please wait outside. Are you pregnant? Who's the baby's father? Mr Dimitris Georgiou. I wasn't talking to you, sir. - Why didn't you mention it? - I'm sorry. Do you take us for fools? I beg your pardon! What are you inferring? After all these years she's finally in a serious relationship. She was barely 3 months pregnant when that happened that accident Please finish up. Don't you see how upset she is? There's no need for that, Madam. We're only doing our job. We have to make sure that your daughter... ...can raise one more child. - Please tell me his name again. - Dimitris Georgiou. - Address? - Xenokratous 27. Phone number? We'll contact him. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Clearly you are a father substitute for the children. Thank you. I do whatever I can. It's strange though. It seems as if nothing ever happened here. I've tried very hard to achieve this. - How did you do with your exams? - Good. Give it to me Come here. What a turn on you are Next time bring us one that smiles a bit. I brought her so we'd have some fun. Keep your money. Come on, don't be shy, take it. Well, I liked her a lot. Goodnight. Bye. Next time smile more. Otherwise they won't even screw you for 30 euros. You didn't pay. I told her everything. That's why she jumped. Always at 11 years old. Huh, Dad? I wish I'd jumped too. Grandpa, can I also have some chocolate? Yes, sweetheart, you can. Hello? Speaking. I see. Yes, of course I understand. I'll be right over. Please wait outside. Thank you for coming right away. What's the matter? I saw Myrto angrily tearing up a 20-euro note. After I pressed her for answers... ...she said things at home aren't good. What do you mean? That you are very violent. Violent? You must be joking. To be honest, I don't know what to believe. I can see you show great interest... ...in children's schooling. You know, things at home are difficult after the accident... Myrto and Angeliki were very close. I don't know why she said these things. Perhaps because I forbade her to see her boyfriend. I caught them smoking. She had problems with some kids at school, too. Maybe I also made mistakes. I overreacted. I didn't know she was under so much pressure. I'm never home. The family is big and there's not much money. But drugs are a serious matter. That's no excuse for violence. You should know that I'll keep talking to her from now on. If she complains again... ...I'll be forced to notify Welfare. When such things happen... ...kids need help from all of us. Of course. Of course, you're right. She respects you and values your opinion. Only let's not make her ashamed to come to school. Deep down inside she knows what she did wrong. Come on, come on. I didn't want you to go hungry. It was very sad for me, but now we'll forget all about it? Come on. Come and eat. Shall we go and get some ice cream too? - It's a nice house,isn't it Alkmini? - Yes. Here you are. Mister Dimitris is a very good friend of mine. My Alkmini dances very well. Don't you Alkmini? Yes. Do you want to dance? Come on, don't be shy. Show us how well you dance. Mommy... Mommy... Mommy... You go to sleep. Go to sleep. Do you hear me? Here you are. In the morning we'll go to the beach. Fine. I want to lie down. Are you coming? In a while. I want to finish here. Daddy... Daddy? Eleni, lock the door.
