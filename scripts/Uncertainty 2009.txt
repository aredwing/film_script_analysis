I'm not afraid of either scenario, but I just want this to be something we're doing, not something we're not doing. What does "this" mean? "This" meaning whatever we decide. Well, "this" sounded like some kind of decision. No. It wasn't. What are we gonna do today? Brooklyn or Manhattan? That's not what we were talking about. I know what we're talking about. What do you want to do? Hey. What? Why not? We can't do that. Why not? Hey. Hey. Hi. Hello. So I thought it would be a good idea to get my mom flowers, so we'll stop at a florist on the way. She'll like that. Yes, she will. Can I take credit? It was my plan. Dim sum. Dim sum. Is it cool we're not seeing your family for the barbecue? Yeah. It's great. I needed the excuse. I can't be around them today. And I'm the perfect excuse. No, I wasn't trying to make you-- No, it's all right, 'cause your mom adores me so much anyway. Hold on, there's a seat belt in my ass. What is this? Did you get a new phone? No. My God, this is, like, the 2010 version. Someone is hating life right now. Let's just give it to the cabbie. No, no, wait, don't give it to him. Don't give it to him. Come on, let it. No, no, no. Why? He won't give it back; he'll just sell it. Don't you remember I lost my phone just, like, a month ago in a cab, and I never got it back. If you give it to the cab company then they'll-- they'll call the people that-- No, they won't. They won't. So what are you, like, a Canadian Mountie? Gonna save the phone? Why you got to make it about Canada? I'm gonna get it back to whosever this is. Hi, my name is Bobby Thompson. I just found this phone in the back of a cab, and I'm trying to get it back to its rightful owner. My number is 917-817-- Why are you giving them your number? What? Sorry. My number is 917-817-65-- And, we'll try to figure this out. Okay, thanks. What? Why would you be calling, leaving your name and number when the person who lost this phone is just gonna call their phone number and expect somebody to answer it? You don't have to go through their roster of friends and family. Just don't-- Hi, my name is Bobby Thompson. Don't leave your name. Why not? Excuse me, I'm sorry. It's yours. It's not in my purse. Probably your mom. Don't answer it. Yeah, it's your mom. Hi, Sylvia. Keep the change. Hey, thank you. Thanks for not taking The Bowery. Hey, I got a call on this thing. Bobby, careful. Hello? It's Perez, you assfuck. We had a deal for that phone, didn't we, Dmitri? I think you got the wrong guy. I've had it with this bullshit. I just picked up this phone. Who was it? Was it the guy? I don't know. I'm going inside. Go ahead, go. Hello? I'm so glad that you picked up. I think you found my phone. My name is Dmitri. Yeah, I found your phone in the back of a cab. Hi. Be about 10 minutes. Man, I'm glad you called. I've been calling around. I left a few messages. What are you talking about? Who did you call? Who did you call? I don't know, but some guy just called back. He said his name was Perez. Perez? Okay, look, I need to come get phone right now. Don't call anyone else. Where you are? What is address? The address? Address! It's... it's 40 East Broadway. Okay, I'm getting in the taxi right now. I'm wearing a red jacket, okay? Red jacket. Red jacket, okay? How will I know who you are? I... I'm wearing a yellow T-shirt. Hey... how come your mom thought we might not be coming? When did you talk to my mom? The phone just now. I told you not to answer that call. You didn't know it was your mother. If I ask you not to answer my phone, you shouldn't answer it. You can't just not answer the phone. That is not my rule. Wasn't that the turn? Shit. You got me flustered! Sorry. My God. Is that a stray? She's gonna get hit like that. Do you see anyone she belongs to? She came from over there. Come here. Come here. Careful. Come here, girl. She's nice. She's gentle. Where's she coming from? I don't know. Where are you going? She just licked my hand. Where are you going, doggie? Here, she's got a tag. "Tiger." Maybe we shouldn't go to Fitz's party. No? I'm gonna want a margarita. I thought you could have one now and then. Yeah, maybe. Maybe not. You're kidding. I'll be right back. And I'll wait in line. Hello? Hello, my name is Dmitri. I think you found my phone. I must have left it in the taxi this morning. Okay. Where are you? I'd like to come get it. You know, someone else named Dmitri just called and said it was his phone. I don't know who you talked to, but that's my phone, and I need to get it back. Can you bring it to me? No. What do you want? I'll pay you. You hear me? Where are you? No, man, I'm here at a restaurant in Chinatown with my girlfriend. Where are you exactly? The address here is 40 East Broadway. You can come down here and work it out with the other guy if you want to. What? Don't give that phone to anyone else. What's going on? It belongs to me; it's my phone. I don't know who you talked to, but it's mine. Look, I don't know what the deal is. You can work it out with him. Actually, he's already here. What? That's my phone, do you hear me? Was that gunfire? What just happened? Can you hear me? Just get out of there. You're in danger, do you hear me? Take the phone and get out of there. You're in danger. Come on! Do you think he followed us? No. It's okay. He didn't follow us. It's okay. You okay? Bobby, is that man gonna die? Yeah, he's dead. It's okay. It's okay, all right? Listen. Listen, look at me. Look at me, okay? We're safe here, okay? We're safe here. We're safe here. We're safe, okay? Just breathe. Now, we should go and ask where there's a police station. There's one in Union Square. The nearest is in Union Square. There's one-- okay, we'll go there. Okay. Okay. Don't worry about anything, okay? There is a downtown local train now at Union Square. Come on, pooch. Look at this. You okay? Okay? We'll go to the police; we'll tell them what happened. All right? I love you. If this gets weird, you just tell me. It's fine. Trust you and let's see, we could do this. Hello. What took you so long? Where have you been? Look what we found. Hey, Bobby. Hi, Felix, how are you? How are you doing? Good to see you. Happy July 4th, I guess? Yeah, happy July 4th. Hi, papa. You look relaxed. Hey, why shouldn't I be? Why shouldn't you be? I know. He's sleeping. Tip-toe. Hi, mami. I miss you. Look at how thin you are. I know, you always say that. Hi, Sylvia. Hi. Hi, Bobby. Those are for me? For you. Thank you. My pleasure. They're beautiful. That was your idea? Yeah. I knew it. Very nice, thank you. I'll put them in a vase. Who is she? This is-- We just... just picked her up. She was trying to cross Jamaica Boulevard. We were afraid she might get hit, so we picked her up. But, you know, is she vaccinated or something? I mean, it can be a danger, no, for the children? Mom, I wouldn't have brought her here if I thought she was a danger. I don't know. If you want, you know-- Look at all your meat. Look at all of it. Well, I-I have your salmon and your salmon. Thank you. Hello, hello! Emily! I thought I heard a Broadway star in the house. Hi, Emily. How are you? Good. How are you? Good to see you. You look great. Thank you, so do you. Hello, Mr. Bobby. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good to see you. Good to see you. Who do we have here? This is our new friend. Yeah? Yeah. You got a dog. Yeah, they found it in the street. You know, actually, maybe it would be a good idea if you run upstairs and use the computer in Hector's room and make some "dog found" signs. Yeah, good idea. "Dog found" signs. The computer is broken, but perhaps you might fix it? Yeah, I'll take a look at it. Thank you. Okay, sure, of course. By the way, how is your father? My father? He's well. Yeah? Thank you. Yeah, he's living with his brother in Calgary. Calgary. I'd like to see a picture. Perhaps, next time you're coming, you can bring one? Okay, I'll try to-- I'll--I'll find a picture. Thank you. Okay. How nice, Calgary. Mami, why would you ask him for a picture of his father? Well, I'd like to see a picture of his father. Do you--do you know him? Why is Uncle Diego all alone out there? Sorry? I'm going outside, Mom. Hey, Katalina. Tio. Hey. Tio. Katalina. Como estas? So how are you? I'm okay. Yeah? Yeah. How are you? I'm doing okay. Yeah? I'm fine. You're not so bad? How's your dancing? It's so good. Yeah? Yeah, I'm in a show. In a show? Yeah, on Broadway. On Broadway? Yeah. Yeah. Can I come and see it? You already came to see me. You've seen it. I'm going crazy. Yeah, I came to see you. Get her! Get her! Come back, Tiger! Come on! It's a dog. What is that dog doing? Bobby and I found her crossing the street. It's him. Hello? Tell me what just happened. Talk to me. I just watched a guy get shot is what happened. I need to get that phone. It belongs to me, and I need to get it back. I'm taking the phone to the police. Don't do that; listen to me. Tell me where you are. I can be there quickly, but don't... I said we're taking it to the police, and if you want it, you can get it from them. I'm done with this. What is with this phone? We should have just given it to the cab driver. So this is my fault? We're gonna do that right now? No, that's not what I'm saying. Don't answer it. Don't answer it. I didn't. That's your phone. Fuck. He has my number? Bobby, please don't answer it. Don't answer it. I'm not asking you for the phone, Bobby. I'm telling you. How'd you get this number? You're not listening to me, Bobby. That phone belongs to me, and I'm getting sick and fucking tired of asking you for it. Get off. We're gonna run, okay? Go! Come on! Come on! Come on! Shit. Come on, you okay? Wait. Damn it! Slide it again. Come on! It's him. Watch out. Excuse me! Come on! Fuck! Okay, there. Train on the other side. Come on! Come on! What the fuck just happened? You okay? How did he find us in Union Square? We were only there for 2 minutes. Are you okay? I'm okay. How did that happen? I don't know. He has my cell phone number. That means he could have my address. He has your cell phone because you left your name and number on those phones or the 2 answering machines or whatever. You're right. And we should have just given it to the cabbie. Okay, yeah, we should have. That could have happened, but it didn't happen. This happened, okay? Let's deal in reality. What's on this fuckin' thing? What is all that? Cyrillic. What's that? It's the Russian alphabet. Man, look at all this. This series of numbers, this is how computers talk to each other. This is--this might be why they want this. Bobby, that's you. My God. $500,000? What's on this phone, Bobby? We need to go to the police. City Hall? There's a police station there? Yeah. Okay, we're gonna turn all our phones off, okay? They must be tracking the thing. Listen to me, okay? All right? That's more like it. Hi. Hi, baby girl. So what are you gonna tell the police? I'm just gonna tell them what happened. We'll give them the phone. Hopefully that'll be that. How can a phone be worth $500,000? That's a good question. I don't know. Hey. Here you go. Let's just put this through first. Hi. We just found this in the back of a cab a couple hours ago. Since then, 3 different people have called us. What do you need? We've been followed, we've been chased. We think that there's something-- We witnessed a murder. You witnessed a murder? Yes. All right, listen, you're gonna need to speak to-- Hey, you're gonna need to speak to Sergeant Hill. Now, he's not here right now, so what you need to do is sit down on these benches back here. When he gets back in, I'll send him down, and he'll talk to you, okay? We just saw someone get killed. And we think it has something to do with this phone. Yeah, yeah... lady, I get it. We saw it. I get it. You need to speak to Sergeant Hill. Now, when he comes back in, I'm gonna have him come down and talk to you. Go sit down on the benches back there, okay? Okay, can we leave this with you? No. But it's not ours. Well, it's not mine either, honey. Take your phone and sit down on the bench. Don't call her honey, please. Easy-- Take your phone, sit down, relax. Yeah, how long you think it'll be? When the sergeant comes in, he'll be back and talk to you. How long do you think it'll be, please? I don't know. Thank you. Very helpful. Thanks. Sorry. It's okay. Okay, now we put this here. Ta-da! Okay. Hey, it's going. I'm gonna do this side here. Daddy woke up. How you like that? What are you doing, little raccoon? So, how is Bobby doing? Bobby's doing good. How's his job? His job is fine. How are you? How are the both of you? We're doing good, Mom. Good. Kate, how's the show going? You said it might close? Yeah, it's gonna close in 3 months. No, you're so good in the show. Thank you. Are you bummed that it's closing? Are you okay? What are you gonna do? You know what you should do is to call Peter. Yeah? Would you like me to call Peter? I mean, he could help you. Who's Peter? Peter is this producer that she's been trying to set me up with. She keeps saying that he's tall, dark, and handsome, and he's... Really? Well, yes, he's handsome, but I'm not trying to set you up with. I mean, I like Bobby. Really, I do. Sylvia, you're almost out of olive oil. Yeah, well, I'll get some later. Let's chop that... Okay. Quickly. Yup. I need it. Yup, yup, yup. Do you think we can use these computers? I don't know. I'm gonna go ask. Excuse me. Hi. Are these computers for public use? Yeah, go ahead. Knock yourself out. Thank you. What are you doing? Looking up this guy Perez. The baseball player? "Lottery deputy director George Perez was charged with 3--" Lottery deputy director? "The indictment is certain to be merely the first move by a grand jury." I mean, there could be a lot of different George Perezes. Do you think this is him? I don't know. It could be him. It sounds like him. Wait, wait, wait, wait. "Whether Perez is under investigation for arson in the fire that destroyed a lottery building." Right? Doesn't that sound like the guy? A guy who'd pay half a million dollars for a phone, works for the lottery commission, stealing money. So, wait, you think that's what's on the phone? Whatever information is on the phone that's in my pocket right now is probably being used to-- And you think it's this? We have to get rid of this fuckin' thing. Bobby? I mean, I don't know if this is him. Bobby? There could be a lot of different George Perezes. What? What? Come on. What? What? What? What if-- What? What if we sell the Treo? $500,000 is a lot of money. You're not kidding? No. What the fuck's Dmitri gonna do to us if we give it to Perez? Dmitri is the guy who has my number, that probably has my address and knows where I live, that found us in Union Square, sent somebody after us. You-- No. You could only sell it to Dmitri. But he hasn't asked to buy it. He would. He definitely would. But how would we contact him? You'd have to turn on the phone, and then they could track us. Yeah, so you'd have to talk to him. You could talk to him through e-mail. You set up an e-mail account. You get him the new address. But then you'd have to call him to give him the e-mail, and he could still track us. That's true, we would have to turn on the phone for, like, a second. Turn it on, get him the address, and turn it right back off. So how would they not track us? Well, you could do it while we were moving. You know, we get on a bus, send him a text, turn it on, turn it off. We take it one step at a time. We can come back here whenever we want to. Okay. $500,000... Is a lot of money. Yeah. Over here. One more. How's it going? That's so cute. This one... or this one? That one. That one? Okay, that's it. Sweet dog. Yes, you are. Who do you belong to? Do I remind you of my mother? Is that a trick question? What, you think I-I-- you--I do? I don't know, I don't know how to answer that. I was raised by a single dad. 'Cause, you know, she just... grilled me down there. It was so intrusive, and it made me not want to be here, so, that's-- What did she ask? She's asking a lot about your job, and-- and then she was asking me, am I happy? I think she asked me, like, if I was happy, if you and I were happy, and it made me so uncomfortable, considering what's going on. Well, she's your mother. She should want to know if you're happy, right? I mean, I don't know. Look at her. This goes here. She's so cute. It's a good flyer, right? Hi, I'd like to use the internet, please. I need your credit card for a deposit. Here you go. And can I have some of those crackers? This'll just take a minute. Then we'll find a bus. Don't use your real name. Yeah. What's your password? You gonna tell me what it is? It's "I love Treos." Now... we have an e-mail address. Get it, come on! Tiger! Tiger! You ready? All right. "We have an offer for the phone. $500,000." Wait, 5. Yeah. $500,000. Yeah. "Will you match? " Yeah. "Contact us via e-mail Okay, is that it? Yes. Okay, send. Okay, turning it off. Put it away. It's off. Bobby, what are we gonna do if he actually says yes? Well, I mean, I guess we'll meet him somewhere, and he'll-- What do you mean you guess we'll meet him somewhere? I don't know, I mean, we didn't talk about it. Fuck, Bobby. This isn't all me. This isn't-- Okay, so, please, a small bottle, nothing fancy. Okay. Just Bertolli or something like that. May I buy the olive oil, please? No, thanks. It's--it's on me. It would really be my pleasure. No, no, I insist. I can't. I can't. I can't. Mom, let him buy the olive oil. No, it's my bottle of olive oil, okay? That's okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I tried. Buenos dias. Hey, Diego. How are you? Hi. Good to see you. It's Bobby. Hi, Bobby. Hi. Sylvia, can you make me some breakfast? That okay? It's lunchtime. It's okay, he doesn't remember you. It's okay, he barely remembers me. Okay. Katie! In here. Where's that mutt you found? Here she is. Let's see if this works. There we go. Bobby can keep his belt. Nicely done. Thank you. Yeah. All right, take her outside before she goes all over the kitchen floor, all right? Mom, I'm gonna check on the kids, okay? Wash your hands. We're leaving too. Don't take too long. We're just gonna put up the signs. See you. See you. Don't be too late. See you later. Have fun. Hey, tio Dio, you want to play? No, no, I'm waiting for something to eat. Which way should we go? Let's go this way. Sit. Good dog. My God! Did you see that? Bye, papi. We'll be back soon. All right, see you later. I can't believe what idiots we are. How could we not think it through? Okay, let's just say that he agrees. He says, "Okay, I'll pay." He's gonna want to meet us face-to-face. He's not just gonna give us any money without getting the phone right away. But you can't trust a guy like that. If we meet him face-to-face, you don't know what he's gonna do. He could kill us. It's kind of ironic, plotting criminal activity with all these guards and cameras and security around. That would do it, though, right? Guards and cameras would do it. If we were somewhere with a bunch of security, what could he do? If we were standing right there, he couldn't do anything. What, at the UN? We can't do it there. Okay, well, we find somewhere. Like an airport. Or even a bank. Right? We say, "Meet us at this bank at this time. We bring the phone; you bring us money." Yeah, we're safe when we're inside the bank, but what happens when we leave? We have the money; he has the phone. He could just-- You're right, he could just follow us. He could have a gun. He will definitely have a gun. It's hot. She must be hotter than we are. Hey, not as hot as you. I don't feel very hot. Why not? That's my ringer. Yeah, sorry, I still have it in my pocket. It's your mom. Thank you, Bobby. Hi, mami. Okay, we'll be back soon. Bye, mama. Bye. Bye. What if the money stays? We leave it there. It's a bank. We can't open a checking account with $500,000. But we could open a safety deposit box. Leave it in the safety deposit box? Yeah, we could leave it there, and then when we leave the bank, we don't have anything. There's nothing he can take from us. Makes sense, right? Yeah, makes sense. I think I know a good bank to do it in. You okay? You didn't say anything to anybody, did you? I thought we're not saying anything. 'Cause Emily, she kept staring at my boobs and my stomach. That's 'cause you got nice boobs and a nice stomach. That's not what I mean. You're not showing. Nobody can tell. I can't tell. I-I just feel like I'm lying to everybody who loves me, and it feels wrong. I can see that. I mean, it is kind of sneaky, I guess, the way we're-- Are you calling me sneaky? No, us. We're--we're-- Even if we knew what we were doing, we might not, you know, talk about it to other people. I just think we should have come to some sort of decision by now, because the longer we wait, it's just gonna get harder and harder. Yeah, I think we should just talk some more, and keep talking about it forever, and talk and talk, and then we will have talked, and that'll be really good. Is that what's known as a pregnant pause? You're so funny. Well, I write music, not lyrics. Katie? How you doing? Hi, Danny. I'll get the oil. How you doing? Good, where you been? I moved to Fort Greene. Fort Greene, very nice. Excuse me, can I have an instant lotto millionaire? I should ask you about this dog. We found her at this intersection today. She was crossing it by herself. I mean, she seems to be pretty well trained, so she must belong to somebody. Have you seen her around here? No. No, sorry. Is this okay? Yeah. Hey, I'm Bobby. Hey, Bobby, how you doing? I'm Danny. Nice to meet you. This is it. This is the one I was telling you about. Look, it says "safe deposit box" right there. It's good, 'cause it's glass on all sides. These doors are glass. We can see anyone coming from any direction. There's a camera right there. God, there's 3 back there. There's another one. I think this is gonna work. Let's go check e-mail. Where is everybody? Well, he's out there. Meet me all by break of day. If we shadows have offended, think but this and all is mended, that you have but slumbered here while these visions did appear, and this weak and idle theme, no more yielding but a dream. Gentles, do not reprehend. If you pardon, we will mend. And, as I am an honest Puck, if we have unearned luck, now to 'scape the serpent's tongue, we will make amends ere long. Else the Puck a liar call... And so good night unto you all. Give me your hands, if we be friends, and Robin shall restore amends. My God, hi! My God! How long have you been standing in the corner? See you downstairs, guys. So guess what? My drama teacher knows this agent who was in the audience, and he was there watching, and he's, like, referring me to his associate in L.A., so, like, so I'm gonna have an agent when I go to L.A. Anyway, this is my friend Beth. Beth! Hi. It's great to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you. This is Bobby. Bobby, Beth. Great to meet you. Are you excited for fireworks? Yeah. Very. How was your trip out? Hi. Number 13. Thanks. Let's do this quickly, Bobby. Do you remember the password? Yeah. Fuck. Hey, we got an e-mail. My God, Bobby. What? We have to get out of here. The men in the SUV are downstairs. Is there another way out of here? Washroom, something? Come on. Can you break it? We shouldn't. They'll know where we are. Okay, come on. Hold this. All right? Okay, let's go. How the fuck did they find us? I don't know. You can't trace an e-mail account that fast. It was probably the credit card. Paid for the internet with my credit card. So, Bobby, you like it here in New York? Yeah. Yeah, I like New York. It's a nice town. You think you'll stay here? That's a good question. What, do you have to get, like, papers and things? You do. They call it a green card. Hey, viejo, here's some more. Bozo, that's great. All right, is this ready? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was just gonna start that. Bobby, how do you like your salmon? On the rare side, I guess. You got it. Thank you. I'm gonna cut this up, all right? That's good. You don't eat meat? Nah, I've been... cutting out the meat of late. You're a fish guy. A fish guy? Yeah, one of those fishitarian alien men. Vegaquarian? Did you have a bad meat experience or... It's funny you should ask in this house. It kind of started here. Kate's got a-a thing with food and--and her mom. Which makes Bobby give up the gift of meat. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. Just checking. I mean, whatever makes it work. Hey. Hey. How you doing? I'm nauseous. Can you go get the ginger pills out of the car? I thought so. How'd I know? Will you go first? I'm scared. I knew that you were gonna disagree with me, so I made the decision on my own. Really? Yeah. Come on, you are so smart, and, you know, sometimes you're so confused, you know? So if you don't get the scholarship next year-- I'll get the scholarship again. That's not gonna be a problem. And if you don't, then what? I think... I'm gonna get it again. It almost went over me. It flew past, a bee. Well, we don't want to kill the bee, do we? Let's try it again. You're gonna go back to your studies? Yes. I don't think so. Well, why don't you just let me make that decision for myself, okay? I'm 18. I've done really well in school. I think I've earned the right-- What do you want? You want to struggle like your sister? What struggle are you talking about? I'm sorry. No, what? No, nothing. You all have jobs. You have-- they're all happy. Here's the ginger. I'll be outside. I'll get that. The Shermans? Yeah, yeah. Is this enough filling for one? Yes, that's perfect. Can you tell your father, please, that the Shermans are here? Papi? Papi. How you doing? Look at you. Darling. She looks great. Hello! Hey! How you doing? Hey, Sylvia! So nice to see you. You too. This is my casserole for you. Okay, thank you very much. That's for Felix. What's that? Go get your son, please. That's a very nice one. Jack! We got 3 now. We pissed him off. God. Okay, so it's his guys at the internet place. He's scared. Doesn't seem scared to me. He's making threats. Fuck. Okay, well, that's what we wanted. That's what we talked about. That's what we talked about. We're gonna do it? Okay? You sure? Okay, I'm gonna send it. No, I want to send it. Okay. Maybe we should turn the Treo on. What, just to fuck with him? Yeah. That's a good idea. I got another message from Perez. What does it say? Nothing. He just wants to know why we didn't get back to him. He doesn't know anything about us, though, does he? No, I don't think so. Okay, I'm turning off the phone. So now what? What do we do? We wait until the morning. You hungry? I'm always hungry. You did good. Look how much you ate. I appreciate you taking care of these. All right, make a little space here, please. Good. Really good, yeah. All right, round 2. Nice. Mami, there's more down here if you want any-- you just let me know, okay? Hey, guys? This is the time for a toast. Para arriba. Para arriba. Para abajo... Para abajo... Al centro. Pa 'dentro. Salud. Salud. I want everyone to taste my empanadas. That's what you want. I'll go for you. Earl, we will get you some gardening going here. I actually own, finally. Congratulations. Thank you. Little piece of New York. That's right. It's like me in a cubicle with a phone and a computer, and that's really it. Yeah. You know? All day long, right? All day long. I don't have anybody bringing me fresh tomatoes like you did, or my--or my coffee or something like that. There was interference there. Their player went out of the line, and he hit the guy in the-- They lost. Here--here they come! Can I have one? Yeah, pass the plate. These are just vegetarian, right? They're beef. No? I can't have? No? What do you think, everybody? They're great. You're my little girl. I'd love to go to Harvard. She should. She just--she just deferred her scholarship. They are driving me absolutely insane, tio. Do you know what happened? So it's yours. It's gonna be ours. This isn't renting. There's no more renting. It's gonna be so much larger. We've had, like, no time. I'm working extra shifts, and we got 2 kids, she's taking off. She gives me shit for not cleaning up the home, because she wants everything to be perfect. My father was there when-- he was stationed in--in New York when the Giants were here, and that--that's part of why I wanted to come here, actually. Don't you worry about it. They give me all the credit for getting the grades. Relax. But they don't let me make my own decisions. The same happened to Katalina. Don't worry about it. Your father used to give a hard time to Katalina, and look at her. She's doing good now. You should do the same thing. The same happened with the music, okay, for Hector. Hector had the pa-- the passion. Tio? Where is he? Tio? Why isn't he here? Tio, don't you remember? Hey, Felix. Felix. Tio. Why isn't he here? Why isn't Hector here? Where is he? Diego. Diego. Hector is not coming. Remember, I told you that? He's not coming. Right? Yeah, right. Relax. Excuse--excuse me. You don't have to leave the table, tio. Do you want me to come inside with you? No, sweetheart, that's okay. Just stay. Stay. I had no idea it was this bad. I'm so sorry. Yeah, he's-- Mami. I don't know what to say, but I guess he's also drinking a little bit. He'd always sit up here, right? Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's a shame, you know, so young and-- Hey. You want to come outside and smoke a cigarette with me? Mami, you okay? Okay. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. You want more sausage, mom? You want more sausage? No. What, did you quit again? No, I'm just not smoking right now. Why? Because I don't think I should. Oh, my God. Katie. I know. My God. Katie. I know. Katie. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. No, that's okay. That's okay. Does Bobby know yet? Yeah, it's been 11 weeks. I know. I know. But it's just that every time I try to make a decision... I don't... make a decision. I don't know why. You're really mad about this, aren't you? Can't believe you're eating roast beef. One sandwich. It--it will lead to others. One sandwich does not mean that I've failed in my commitment to fishitarianism. You know, I'm not gonna kiss you till that shit's out of your system. How do I know when it's out of my system? Hey. Salud, Bobby. Salud. For many more. Maria, I love you. My son. Mami. Cheers, Bobby. I love you. Don't shoot it; just sip it. That's good. We'll take some of this with us. This Earl knows what he's doing, let me tell you. Look who we found eating ice cream in the kitchen. Aparecido, muchacho. Me estaba comiendo un helado deliciosa. Mira, mira. Numero cinco. The fireworks. My God. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we should go to the--hey. I liked it. I did. That's good. You okay? Yeah. Where are we gonna go? I don't know. My back hurts. Those seats were tiny. Your back hurts? Yeah. That's so funny. Hector would always talk about seats being too small for him, so he'd have to sit in the aisle. Hector did? Yeah. You don't talk about your brother as much as you used to. I know. Bobby, where are we gonna go? I don't know. We can't go home, though. I don't like being on the streets. Well, we could go to Fitz's party. I told him we were gonna come. All right, let's go. Why not? Come on. Go like this. Hey, Bobby, can you do this? You want a beat? Do something. Te deja un paseo Como es estudiante ya se va Escalona Pero de recuerdo te deja un paseo Que te habla de aquel inmenso amor que llevo dentro del corazn que dice Sorry, excuse us. Sorry. It's so fucking hot. We got to say hi to Fitz. Bobby! Hey. What's up, man? How are you? Thanks for having us. Absolutely. I brought Kate. Kate! Hi. I think there's a roof. Okay. Yeah. My God. Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on, girls. Don't get hit by a car! Tiger on there. Did you hear that? Yeah. Hey, will you slowpokes hurry up, please? You know, I don't talk about my brother as much as I used to because... I just don't think about him as much. You know, he's been dead a long time. It's been 5 years. My mom thinks about him every day... Every minute. Makes me think like something's wrong with me. There's not. Promise. Would we be people with a kid... or parents? What's the difference? Jack? Come on, girl. Come on, girl. Ay, come on, girl. Bye, Bobby. Nice meeting you. Nice to meet you. It was really nice to see you guys. I'm gonna go say good-bye to mami. Felix, thanks again. Hey, my pleasure. Hey, had a good time? Si. Tranquilo? Yeah. I'll--I'll pick you up next week? Thank you. And we watch some football. I asked Bobby if he could drop off Uncle Diego. Yeah, he said it's fine. So here is the pasta, las empanadas. Mama. I want to ask you something. Could you talk to your sister? Please, talk to her. You know, I... I want to talk to her, but it's impossible. I mean, she's not listening. I mean, I do everything wrong. She's gonna trust you, you know? You're assuming that I agree with you. You do agree, don't you? Please, I can't sleep, you know? It's a big mistake. I mean, I cannot rely on your father. I'll talk to her. Want to put this in a bag? Yeah? We're leaving. Hey, what? I thought--I thought that you were staying over tonight. No chance in hell. Okay, well, listen, you have to call me this week, okay? I will. You have to keep me posted. I will. Call me tomorrow? Sophie, I think-- What? You were so wonderful this afternoon. Thank you. I'm so glad you got to see some. Me too. Okay, bye. Bye. Love you. Call me tomorrow. I will. Okay? I will. Okay, love you, bye. I love you, papi. I love you. Bye, mama. Bye. Happy Independence Day. I'm not feeling very independent. So how long has he been living in this place? Couple years. How long did he box for? God, since way before I was born. Did you ever see him? I did. Hey, tio Dio? Yes? I'm pregnant. That's beautiful. You're gonna have a baby, Katalina? Do you hear that, Tiger? Katalina's gonna have a baby. That is nice. Who is the father? Tio, Bobby. That's nice. Can you kick it up a notch? Like, kick it up? O Canada Yeah, that's it. Our home and na-- You know, we haven't known each other for that long. It's not that long. No, it's not a long time. It's not. Doesn't it feel like a long time, though? Okay, good point. What if you couldn't write music anymore? What if--what if you couldn't play music anymore? I'd kill myself. Very funny. I'm gonna play music. I'm gonna play music. Look, I know what you're saying, all right? Because based on our decision, there's consequences for that, for me. I know, things change. Things change based on our decision, but I'm gonna play music, and you're gonna dance. Dancing in a kitchen? It wouldn't happen like that. Do you see what's behind you? It's beautiful. Why don't we stay up here tonight? Okay. We're here, tio. Welcome back, Diego. Hi. Did you have a good day? Yes. I love you. I love you too, Katalina. Wanna say bye to Bobby? Okay. Bye. Bye-bye. You want to come over? Okay. Okay, girl. Come on. Come into the kitchen. Come into the kitchen. Do you have a bowl or something so we can give her some water? Yeah. A bowl that doesn't have, like, light soy sauce. Yeah. Mint Moroccan tea? That's new. I'm so hungry. Yeah, we haven't eaten today. Almost. What? What are you thinking? How many months have you been here? Not that many. I can't tell if you're still unpacking or packing. Unpacking. What are you really thinking about? I think my mother is all right. What do you mean? I just saw so clearly today how... she thinks life has... disappointed her. Really? You know what I saw today in your mom that I never saw before? Just how strong she is. She reminded me of you today. What? You scared? I know. I don't want to disappoint you. Will you kiss me now? Let's get down to the bank. Dog in the house. Tiger. Come here, come here. We're out of coffee. I'm supposed to be at work later today. What was that? It's a text from Fitz. Asked why we didn't come last night. I thought it'd be something about Tiger. No, it's not. What are we gonna do with the dog? Hi, we'd like to open a safety deposit box, please. Yeah, upstairs. Upstairs? Yeah. I just need some signatures on the back where the Xs are. There. Now, the both of you are gonna be on there? Yes. Okey-doke. We need to decide what size box you want. We have the 2-inch and the 5-inch. They're both 18 inches long. All right. Do you ever feel like you're pretending? I hope you're not talking about last night. And I think we're all set. If you'll just follow me, I'll show you where they're kept. Is that gonna be big enough? How big is $500,000? That's what I'm saying. So, just have to show you how it all works. So I had this cup of espresso. I'm talking just a tiny shot, you know? The tiniest shot. Not even, like-- it's a single, not a double. And I felt it instantly in my body. Like, I was jittery. I had a hard time concentrating, and I felt it in my stomach. Like, I felt it here. Of course, I had to go to the bathroom immediately. Then I was thinking, "Oh, it's not gonna be that way with tea, or diet sodas probably don't have the same effect." But I think tea is different, right? You think? Are you sure that's decaf? Yes. All right. I'm turning it on. Look, are you sure you want to do this? We can't stop after this. Call him. Okay. Hello. Is this Dmitri? Yes. Yeah, this is Bobby. I know. We're at a Chase bank at the corner of Canal and Mott. You meet us here, right now, you bring the money, and you put it in as small a case as possible. We put the money in a safety deposit box, then you get the phone. I'm on my way. He said he's on his way. Let's get back inside. You know, when I was little, my dad told me that babies grew on trees. My dad told me I came from his balls. Well, that was the truth. Yeah. How old were you? Should have been here by now. What did he say? I told you what he said. I mean, did he give you a time when he'd be here? He said, "I'm on my way." That's all he said. What if it's a boy? I don't know anything about boys. I'm a boy. Where the fuck is he? Shit. The guy's here. The guy's here from yesterday. Come on. Come on. What guy? The guy with the gun. Dmitri? No, not Dmitri, the Chinese guy. My God. Shit. Do you see anything? He's down there. I can see him in the mirror. How did he find us? I don't know. But the Treo's on. What is he doing? He's got his phone open. We're safe here. Doesn't feel safe. This was our plan. I know, but it's a stupid plan. Fuck, he's coming up the stairs. Get in the elevator. Go, go. Fuck. Bobby, turn it off! I am, I am, I am. Turn it off! I am. Shit. Give me your purse. Take it! Just go! Sorry! Sorry. Excuse us! In here! In here, in here. Go, go! Get back there! Okay. Bobby, is he there? Bobby. Look at me. I don't think I can run anymore. Yes, you can. No, I don't think I can. The door's locked. The door's locked, okay? Come on. Come on! Okay. You're okay. Bobby, I can't. You're okay. Come on, okay? We have to find a way down. Okay, okay. Fuck! Come on. Okay. I got you. Come on. Shit! Go! Go, go, go! Crap! Come on! Bobby, I can't. Got you. In there! In there! Bobby, the lock! Is it locked? Let's go. Okay. God. Which way, Bobby? The... south. Do you see him? No. The bridge. Fuck! Wait. Wait. This is fucking crazy. I know. I almost told my mother last night. And then you came to your senses, right? Well, I mean, I told my sister. Yeah, I know you did. But I-I know that my mother wouldn't understand that it's a decision, you know? I mean... The fact that not wanting to have a baby was my first instinct, one I thought that I'd-- we'd absolutely act upon, and I thought that's definitely what we'd do. That's what we both thought. Okay. I think we're all right. That didn't go so well. What happened? What do you think we did wrong? Ethically or logistically? Yeah, you choose that one. It's time we decide. I know. You don't know. I do know. We'll decide. And it'll be a good decision. Will it be the right decision? Yeah. Are we through? God, yes. Here, hold this. What are you doing? Bobby? Hello? It's Bobby. Things didn't work out. We're taking ourselves out of the equation. Just give me the Treo, Bobby. All I want is the phone. The Treo's on. Nice shot. What time do you have to go to work today? No particular time. Guess I'll probably go after you go to the theater. So what do we do now? I don't know. Guess we just keep going. What do you want to do now? I don't know. I guess we just keep going. I know.
