There were four cars police in the parking lot. I suspect that came by ship. I'm going home to hide it. Relax, do nothing. I know that some kids found something and the police are not investigating, but the NSSC. - I know that people disappear. - Have not seen you on TV? Oh, you remembered. WZPZ, Tori Lee Investigative reporter. Tiler Burns. Man student. Let man, we are late for the physics class! What happens in NSSC? They try to hide a UFO pretending to be a experimental aircraft. You know what? I thought so. Hey, watch out! Is Julie. Julie! How are you? Seems furious! Meet you here and this is all you have to say? No. Where were you last night? I waited for hours. Let me posted and now lies! You know how to use the girls. Sorry. Let me explain what ... - Kiss me my ... - Darryl Butler!, Coming! You had a chance, Nick, but you blew it. You want a translation? No, I think he understood. Beware, the next time, will hold in the cactus! Beware, Butler! - Julie Do you threw in the trash? - Temporarily. - But it may decide to return. - Do not trust it. And the next time he shows up with my brother has problems with me. Why not now? I am warning you! I am yellow stripe. Tyler ... If you knew anything about UFOs, can talk to me. I'll give you my phone. Really? Can I have your phone? Nick, my phone is on you? If the NSSC find the phone, are finished, I took pictures. - I believe you lost it. - I did not fall, you left! If it was taken for pick-up home, I would be in confusion. What? Excuse me? I said I could choose what not belonged to us, would go to jail? - Now, repented? - No! My only regret is that we a robot to investigate the NSSC. You do not see, do not see what we did. You are paranoid! So, back to the mother, give a hug and eat cookies. Who wants a cookie? - Hi, Mom! - Hello! - Hi, Mom! - Boys ... He is the agent of Armstrong, the NSSC. Do you have any idea what look in our kitchen? No. No idea. You, last night, by chance have not seen an unusual airplane in the sky that landed on the road precisely they returned home. The test ended at 6:00 and only arrived at home after 8:00. The football team tied me in a tree. It was not long for untie you, Tyler? Welcome ... We were caught. We arrived late because ... I had a meeting to the Julie Gunn. - Julie Smokin 'Gunn? - Right. Who is this Smokin 'Gunn? It is the most beautiful girl since kindergarten. I have to confirm story? No, because we When we meet, because Tyler did not return alone in the truck, home. See? I said there a simple explanation. Now, if already done, I would like to talk with these two alone. We saw two boys running in a red pick-up the place where the UFO crashed. It is better to invent another friend. Nobody believes in UFOs. One day, boys, only be you and me. And minutes later ... I want to be alone. Government wants to dissect, the mother is suspicious, press to divulge story ... My life is over! Who's calling? Hi, Julie, is Nick. Please call me. Thank you. After you took off? Where is your self-esteem? Where's your dignity? Forget it! She closed the windows. - What? - The window of the former. When someone breaks up with Julie, still has a window by 48 hours to reconcile before becoming an ex. You had, Julie closed the window well in your face. Oh, no! She told me! - Moreover, we have a secret weapon. - No, we ... No! We can not. In the middle of the afternoon? You said you know the words as "stop" and "go home". And if I say "use this baby before to close the window? Julie's car. See? The window of Julie's back. Cool! Down, boy! You know what to do. Go! Tyler! Tyler! You did that? How am I? I'm fine? Hi, beautiful! - Need Help? - Not you. Hi, Dad! My car broke down. Call me! I take a look? Just look. You know me messages? In fact, there were three. - Six messages. - Six. I deleted them all. Without hear them. Really? Pity. Because it was an apology from the heart, the other two were sweet and romantic. Yes? I kept the other three. And I do not want to hear them? I love you I'll get you! - Thank you ... I think. - If I want to thank you, Let's go, before Darryl, leave the cafeteria. - Right. Between! - Great! Sorry, sorry ... It's not over! You hear me? It's not over! What ... Brother ... Thanks, man. We should do it. Julie was ... Formidable. Well, because I think Darryl Butler may have seen the UFO. Who cares? Julie and I go to the pizza, Friday. And with this baby can go to Italy. Forget Italy! Take her to the moon! Tomorrow, we have to find a better place to hide the ship. The best place to hide what? Mother! Come! I'm here, dear. Along with the press. Guys, everyone wants some answers. What they have in the garage, boys? Our bicycles old things, shoes shoes Ty ... - Nick ... - Do not be ashamed, you are talented. Nick is over. We have to tell the truth. We saw the UFO falling. And put in the truck and brought him home. You are in there. What are you waiting open the door! - Do you think this is a joke? - I think you're a joke. - You're stuck! - Okay! Hold us all, and then tell the judge as you stormed a mother and her children because they showed you, their flying thing! We will see us but you do not see me coming. So what we have for dinner? - Water and bread. - Come on, Mom ... Technically I did nothing wrong, right? At one point, education, I skipped the chapter, in which he said never, never should cause problems for a government agency? - Now we say that? - Guys, home immediately! Soon, Mom! I left something in the garage. - I do not understand where is it? - I do not know. Maybe ... - What are you doing? - She's here! - What? - It's right there! Not real! It's invisible! It is invisible. You are camouflaged. It's like a chameleon. I think it is a just a machine. He's alive! He thinks. And you know who are friends. Cool! Our consoles command locas were last night, when listeners began to connect and say they saw a UFO, began to alien invasion and all had a hallucination. Did you hear that? The world saw the UFO. - Maybe they saw another UFO. - There is another UFO. How do you know? If there is one, there may be two or ten or twenty. The guy who said, an alien invasion. - Nick ... - What's with your voice? - I lose my voice. Watch ... - Stop! How to stop? Since when talk like that? You have a cold night? - I have a beard, Nick. - And then? Yesterday, I had not. Let me see, Ty. Let's run! It's the Wolf Man! Welcome to puberty, brother! If the father were here, talk to you the things of man. But as it is not, then I will have to be me. Lesson 1 Do not think you will use my shavers. It would be unpleasant. - Nick, which made my jeans? - Nothing. - You put glue on my pants? - No, did not touch them. The last time I used the stapler. Thank you very much. - You help me, please? - Help you? - And then? Helping to tie their shoes? - Stop! - Ridiculous. - Wait, wait ... For! - In Three. One, two ... - Pull down or up. - I do not help at all! - Welcome ... Wait a second ... It is right! - What? - Man, is as tall as me! You grew up during the night! You're different. It is not normal, Nick! Certainly, it is not normal! Relax, man! Certainly, it's nothing serious. Are late to school, I have to clean the room, come on! If the mother see me so will surely suspect something. - You only have to invent an excuse. - I do not invent! I can not say in part the truth as you. You have three seconds. Um .. - Use my jeans! - Two ... - What? - Take my pants! Three! Good morning! Where is Tyler? He was early for school. Because of its test acting as a pirate. No, no ... I can swear I heard it. No. Not here. Hi, Tyler! Hi, Katie! - Something happens to you two. - About two? With you and Tyler. They may have mistaken the agent Armstrong, last night, but I have years of training in art decipher adolescents. Give up. - It hurts. - Please! - Are watching you. - Right. Two. I told you! Where you are unfamiliar. Actually, forget it! Why is the roof? Underwear? This? This is not underwear. Are ... "Briefs." - Briefs!? - Yes, they are similar to underwear. Are in vogue now. Bears and things. I bet your brother had you say it. Goodbye! Briefs! How could I be so uninspired. You can come, it's gone. Different look. What happened with your workout clothes? Think shrank in the wash. Perhaps not block circulation. Attention is burned, Burns. Supposed to run away from the ball. I'm fine, I'm fine. Go for a walk, Darryl, and take your clowns! It is very brave! You think you can me? I do not know who is crazier, you or your brother. T-Rex, give them a small lesson and good manners! Okay, guys ... Let's make him cry! Come? It has more ammunition. Now try to hold my fastball. Director Duddy ... This means the arrest Mr. Butler. - Finished later. - I can not wait. What? Well, all standing! Step up! - How did you do that? - Well, I ... I have no idea. Tomorrow, at night, we eat pizza, a quiet place and have a little chat ... Actually, not tomorrow. I totally forgot the graduation party of Darry. So I go with you. Nick is his "friend" Darryl. I do not think it's called. One of my qualities is that like a little competition. - Mr. Burns ... - You can take me out? - I think not. - Sorry, Miss. Gunn! I see her tomorrow. Call me if change your mind. Not turn on. I'm surprised they make plans this weekend, Mr. Burns. Director Duddy, we met how long 4 years. You can call me, Nick. Can I call you, Herman? No, you can not! Mr. Hiddlebaum informed me have yet to do the science project. It is a big lie. I started the project. Study on orange juice your brother can drink until he vomits? This is not a project. It's not just orange juice. I added juice grape and wine dry sweet. You should see the color of vomit. Really? In this case we are well. - Really? - No! If you bring a project serious for the examination, within two days, not pass the year. No project without qualification. In other words, you do not graduate. - You will have your project, okay? - Good If you have to repeat the year, I will make your life a nightmare. - Do you understand? - Yes Want to know what a nightmare? The habit of his mouth! I know, chili "causes me many gases ... Janine thinks I'm good. Oh, yes! She wants me My dress for the Graduation ball is super. I'll be the prettiest. You said your pretty dress? Man, I do not have enough social challenges. A dress would not fall and with my social status. You do not hear voices? Come with a lack of sugar. Eat a pudding! No, I'm fine. See you later. do not think anyone noticed my new haircut. I like your new haircut, Claire. new pants make me look fat? Your jeans was well Heather. I'm so bad If you do, do not tell you how get a girl to the prom. You need a girl, right? This is bothering you. I never told anyone. Claire has a new haircut, and Heather have some new trousers. If you make an accolade, of course, one of them will go with you. - If you're lying ... - Do it! If Tyler knew how I want to kiss you. - Hey, you're taller? - I? High? No, I very sprawling when agreement. Okay, I like tall guys. Boys high dark-haired. Boys high, dark hair, smart boys. - Katie I'm sorry, I can not. - What you can? Go to the movies with you this weekend. My life is very crazy. - But not told you yet. - Did not you say? I wanted to tell you, but you gave me no chance. You're a psycho, or something? Psycho? No, no ... I have to go to class. I'll see you tonight. Come dressed for the tests. It was crazy, Nick. Mean, UFO made me a thing! Is taller and has more hair. Notify the press! You should have seen me today in the gym. I was playing very well burnt. You? This is really a novelty. I was better than good. I was fantastic. - I gave a lesson in Darryl Butler. - Really? Seriously, I was never good at anything was remotely athletic. See? It is as if time passes on camera slow and I'm super fast. Therefore, you are taller, with more hair and more athletic. - We cover a superhero. - You do not hear me. I changed. I can do certain things. Yes, let me guess, you can feel a "fart" to 3 meters. I can read thoughts. - You worry me, brother. - No, you're not! You know that this has nothing to do with puberty. And you are. And I think that is a way of trying finish your project, to graduate. - Who told you that I will not pass? - No, that's the point! And you want to change the UFO place, before someone picks it up. - Sure, you're scaring me. - Well, because I am also very much. You're my brother, if you do not take seriously, then who will? Until now, I'm taking seriously, the fact that need to hide the UFO before we are caught by the mother. And I think I found the perfect place, want to see? - I think so. - Well, because you're driving. It may seem that I am 16 years old but I have no portfolio. I did not say you lead my pick-up. - How did you find this place? - Very good, right? Here are two Halloween's, I was challenged by buddy Marty to sleep here one night. - And you usually accepted. - Sure! I won the bet. I need to find a place to hide our stuff. - Watch out for rats! - Mice? What rats? - If you see a mouse? - Searching. Nick! Nick! Nick! Nick! - And now what? - Do not believe what I saw. He spent a film on the windshield of future disasters on Earth. - Fires, floods, pollution. - Yes, show me a replay! Perhaps the lesson of biology Hiddlebaum, give you nightmares. - I'm not invented. - So ... Now, you have psychic visions and watch movies rented in his head. I know what I saw. Something important is happening. Perhaps, therefore, the UFO came to us. Look, I love you, Ty, indeed, but I think that what they're saying affected his thinking. - He believes in nothing, right? - And why you believe it? For Nick this is happening to me! If you do not want to hear, perhaps better, I talk to the agent Armstrong. To get us out of this incredible ship and send to the workhouse? Tyler, this UFO is the coolest thing that ever happened to someone. Why do you want to spoil everything? Okay ... The mother, the less you know better, know only the essential and only answer, ask - If she see me, be scared. - So, do not let her see it. - Hi, Mom! - Where's Tyler? Who? A little boy, who lives here. his brother. Tyler? I have not seen. You are hiding something. Who do you think I am? An amateur? Okay, look ... Not get out of this court, until you say what is happening. - Nick ... - Mom, you're right. Something important is happening. I'm all ears. There is nothing special, Mom. You're exaggerating. When you father hence there are many, many years, you can decide what is important and what not. and what is appropriate. I heard, by his brother, you arrived at puberty? I think it's the most worrying word of English. My little man, growing? You're lucky, brother, because I had a camera, lane meats and Aunt Sofia. You grew even during the night. It is almost ... Weird. Yes, the wonders of nature. Listen to that voice. Honey, do not use razor your brother, is disgusting. I have to call Aunt Sofia. You even at puberty. - It's strange. - Madness. - I do not believe she fell for it. - Man, look at that! What do you think? Is exaggerated? Remember the stupid concert we drew with his mother and father? We did everything together, Nick. You remember this day? You bet. Look for dad ... He was fantastic. He would have heard about me my connection with the aliens. You are exaggerating, Tyler! - He would have heard. - Dad is not here! I hear you, Tyler. I understand that you changed. Thank you. Just do not understand, why, to make this conspiracy theory. - Because ... - For girls now, look you? - Why do not ignore it? - No. .. Because we made the trip more fantastic universe? This is all fantastic, but ... Tyler ... Relax, ok? Now, should help me solve a real problem. Julie goes to the feast of Darryl, and will cancel our meeting. I have to find a way her leave that exhibitionist. And graduation? Not have to do your project? I think this belongs to you. We the field. Where the UFO was seen. - Oh, thank you. - We need to talk. I'm late for class. When I was your age, I used to look at the stars and I was wondering what would be there. That is the reason why I do what I am still looking. I still wonder. - Have you ever felt like this? - All the time ... Your brother is not so confident as you. Now, is very busy, has a important work of science. I think we both started with the left foot. - We can help each other. - I have to go. You can start by being honest on the night found the UFO. And I can explain ... strange things what happen to you. Things that his brother not understand. I entered my number your phone. When you're ready to talk call me. Not have to go through all That alone, Tyler. The rate of deterioration of the environment has reached alarming levels. People are obviously the cause pollution and global warming, but climate change extreme in recent years, seems to be due to causes mysterious and unknown. - Mr. Burns ... Tyler! - Yes, sorry. What do you think is the cause of catastrophic climate change? I do not know. Correct! One knows but if current trends continue, within a generation, Earth may become completely uninhabitable for humans. What is he doing? - Is there a problem, Mr. Burns? - No, Mr. Hiddlebaum. The light bothers me I do not want to miss anything this fascinating lesson. Everything is under control. All right, class. Let's go! I have to go to the bathroom. My mom made pork chops. Funny. His brother used the same excuse last year. What are you doing here? Whether I be expelled? Listen, I'm not having a good day, sure, Last week I was a normal student, and now ... I am here talking to a UFO. I like to order, routine ... I press the toothpaste upwards. My life was well organized until you came. I can not go for a ride. I'm serious! Be a good UFO and go away! Good Okay! What could be worse? What's the panic? - Need to see something! - What? It seems that ate the pie Mom's surprise. He went to school and practically kidnapped me. - Yeah, right. - Truth. Nick, I think it is a kind The message for us. What? What are you trying to say? Buddy ... When you're right, you're right. -Beautiful! ... - Great ... It is a kind of manual. Photos and diagrams all parts. I do not dare use anything without at least check. - It was spectacular! - Yes Before we try something else, I think we should read the instructions. Serious men do not read instructions. Yes, it's a serious man who did a hole in his head real hard. Look! Laxative alien? Had to know work to serve ... What we have here? Spectacular! I think it would be time You cut the hair of the nose, pal. - This is not an ordinary binoculars. - You can not believe that. You can see planets with them, navigate the space. But first, want to research something. Lindo ... This is very useful. What? What happened? Julie is the feast of Darryl. I have to go. - Do not go to any party! - Want to bet? You will in my play! - It's tonight? - Presentation only .. Brother, I have a serious problem. - Today, the night is the prom. - But Darryl did not invite you. - Technically, no. - Okay, technically, he hates you. - I know I promised to see the play. - Correct. - Were exactly those words. - But not forgive more than once. Perhaps not so. The point is that this is my single prom. - There is nothing so special. - You're the best! It seems that sold all entries. Viva pirate! Are late. Where were you? - Practicing my lines. - It came in the trial yesterday evening. - I wanted to come, but my mother ... - No matter. You tell me this story later. Sorry, my sword! Be right back. Pirates, do not forget the slap eyes and fake blood! The party is great. Do not hate me, Nick. All ready for "A Storm Sea. "begins in a minute. Tyler? Where are you? We go on stage now! So where was I? I know. Would thank me, to appear, and save you this boring party. No, I asked, what you are doing here. If you see Darryl, you will be lost. So, in other words, I came here to see it, even the risk of taking a beating. Very romantic. - I'm here with Darryl, Nick. - I understand! The most popular girl out with the most popular guy. Makes sense. But you do not want to try something less predictable? - What? Exiting with a fool like you? - Exactly. - Perhaps but I need to know if take it seriously, or, for you, everything is just a big joke? I can be serious. What about you? That was predictable. Course ... But also caring and encouraging. I think you have some fruit "punch" right here. It is now, he says, "let me clean" and tries to kiss me. Come on think I would use a vulgar trick like that. Nick? Nick? Nick, you okay? I was. What are you doing here? Because you do not answer the phone. I thought I was having problems. - Easy! Why are you nervous? - Why are you nervous? Let's see ... Perhaps because of a monster space trying to kill me. It is a "gamer". He likes to play the alien's, dragons, elves ... Have you noticed how Julie is beautiful tonight? I'm not going anywhere. See you later. You will find me later? I can no longer exist after. I'll let you talk, guys. I thought that was supposed to, take care of each other. - Interrupting a family reunion? - Not now, Darryl. Crazy things are happening and you only care about yourself. - Okay, I'll do it without you. Enjoy the party! - Tyler. I am in detention because of his brother, and you're getting into with my girlfriend. I have to say that at this point, love your family. I'm patiently Now, Darryl. Right!? I do not know what happens with you and your brother, the nut of his brother. Ty is not crazy. Since you do not know. Yes .. This is all because of Julie? He left me kind of burnt, I began to see things. Even, I see a UFO. Yes, I heard that. I heard that he cried as a girl, and fell to the ground. I want you out of here now but ... - What happened? You okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Flawless! Somewhere to be alone. I want you ... But I can not, I'm sorry. Until tomorrow, right? At graduation? I'm glad decide to call me. There was no one else to turn. Your life is about to become much simpler. Here is what has sought. He promised to explain why I these strange things happen. You have had visions telepathic right? Yes I have, not want to play cards with me. - And you have super powers. - Yes, I am a superhero. I just can not wear the my old clothes. So what's going on? When a teenager is a transition of metabolism ... - I mean, puberty? - Exactly. When it is exposed to radiation of heavy particles in space, whole process of growth becomes hyper-accelerated. That's why we grew 13 cm, night. Correct. But the growth is the lowest problems. You may have noticed that you acquired extraordinary powers. Why nobody knows about it? Because NASA has already sent adolescents in space. - I think they should have done. - No idea, as is right. There is a name for People like you. "Skyrunners. Skyrunners ... So when I went to space was That happened to me? Yes Their skills, if properly understood, could do in humans most powerful species the universe. Could become dangerous to aliens. So believes an "alien" came after me? Absolutely! The aliens are very real. And they are closer you think. Hold on! No! Why did you do that? You humans are a very interesting species. So smart Numas things, and so ignorant in others. You said "you". I mean, you're not ... I'm the reason why the your planet is dying. Tyler? Appear, wherever it is! Man, I'm sorry. I behaved like an idiot with you lately. Ty! Tyler ... Where is my brother? Tyler says that you are smart So tell me where! Tell me! Sorry, sorry ... If something happens with my brother ... I'm afraid ... Good You reached here. I'll try to fix you. Instructions ... Please, never, never talk to Tyler I used it, okay? Show me the instructions! Please. Be there! Yes! I see that I can work with it. Oh dear really need help. You know what, it's okay. You know why? Because I have a secret weapon all good mechanics. Tape! Trust me this solves everything! Hold up, okay? It's okay. A minor setback. So, better now? Almost ready. Hold on! Only one to go. So how do you feel? Okay. Fly! Buddy ... Dude, you need to fly! Look ... Only you know where he is. If something happens ... I do not know what to do. Hello? Hello! Is anyone there? Man, I like speed, but this is extreme. I think I'll vomit. What you want from me? Why did you bring me here? Bread and water? Thank you. Very kind of you. Gross. I'd rather die of hunger, you hear? I'd rather die of hunger. Dude, please do not tell me we will get there. We have to get out of here. Get out of here ... You must let me out of here. I suffer from claustrophobia. Brands nails. It means that I am not first visitor here. What the hell ... It seems that some kind spaceship crashed here. This place is a crater enormous impact. Ty ... Tyler! Tyler, where are you, brother? Course ... Here it is. Brother, what happened to you? Tyler ... Disgusting ... Who needs instructions? He said we were the kind most powerful of the universe. Said we were dangerous for aliens. Said I have skills extraordinary. I am a Skyrunner. Nick Take God!

And ever find. - By the way, how did you find me? - The UFO helped. - Is he alive? - Yes - I saw Armstrong destroying it. - I fixed it. You noticed a spaceship? This is great! And where are we now? In a crater of aliens. Never again doubt anything I say. - Really? - Absolutely! So watch out! The aliens are here to destroy the environment and eliminate the humans. Really?
