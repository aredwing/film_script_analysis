Good morning, Mr. Forst. - I have some correspondence and some papers for you to sign. - Don't bother me with that stuff. - Would you like some coffee? - No. - You look lousy. - You're not in a good mood? - Anything I can do for you? - I'll give you a list of my maladies. You better give me a cup of coffee. I don't want to yawn in Mrs. Miniver's face. - Yes, sir. - Hmm? [No Audible Dialogue] - Here you are. - Will you take this thing out of my mouth? - Okay. - Thanks. - Good morning. - [All] Good morning, Miss Whiteford. Hello, Nita. How'd they get you out of bed? Aw, shut up. Harry. Oh, you know Harry Selfrine. [Forst] Do I know Harry Selfrine? Do I know Harry. Good morning. - Jim Mortensen. - [Whiteford] Nice boy. Kazmier, Edward. Do you know Richard Forst, our manager? Hello, darling. Lang. L-A-N-G. How are you, dear? [Kisses Hand] - Good morning, Mr. Draper. - [Whiteford] All right. When I was a kid, we used to play a game called... "Your mother wears army shoes." I'm not your mother. Sit down. - [Laughing] - Do you know Frederick P. Draper? Thank you, Emily Dickinson. - Here you are. - Thank you very much. Thank you. What are you gonna sell us this time, Harry? Money. - Actually, it's a very good film. - We call it the, uh... Dolce vita of the commercial field. - Is that so? - I don't mean to insinuate it's a crude film. We were trying to capture several approaches. - WhatJim means is that we really - No, no. That's not what I mean at all. We were talking facts and figures until we practically went out of our minds. Losses, gains, ratings, schmatings. You can lose your mind if you keep analyzing things like that. Then we came up with an impressionistic document that shocks. - Is that so? - I don't think it so much shocks as it's honest. It's honest, but it's a good piece in itself. So, you see, we're a a little nervous about hitting you with this. Oh, now, they've got nothing to be nervous about. It's a shot in the dark, but it's strong and it's attractive. It better be better than the last one, Harry. I think I'll loan you my sleeping pills. You know, I have insomnia... and I stay awake all night looking at pictures, worrying about pictures. I walk all over the place. - Let's see it,J.P. - I'd rather hear 'em talk about it again. - [Man] We'll talk about it later. - [Forst]J.P. All right, Arnold. Roll it. [Man Making Kissing Sound] [Man] You're after my money, huh? [Makes Kissing Sound] [Chuckles] You're not gonna drink this? Too bad. - Never let good liquor go to waste. # Never let it go to waste # - Oh! # Never let it ## Ida. Ida, I adore you. Never let good liquor go to waste. - Arrivederci! Ciao! - [Man] Go on. Beat it. - "Scusa pleasa." Bye-bye. - [Man] So long, sucker. I'll drive. I'll drive. Give me the keys. Give me the keys. Give me the keys. I'll drive.

I'm not too schooled in these things... but I know somewhere along the line, your little hand's gonna find its way into my pocket. You're shocked, aren't you, old Dickie, old pal? What do you think she is? You think she's some clean towel that's never been used? [Freddie] My God, Dickie. You think you don't pay? How many times a week does Maria ask you for some money? Money, Charlie, is a necessity. And don't you think that you don't work for it and pay for it. My God, wait. What is this? He thinks I'm insulting you. I'm offering you. Hell, look! What's the matter? If I went to one of those fancy restaurants... I'd probably tip the headwaiter, the waiter, the busboy... and a hundred bucks goes flying down the drain. And I couldn't have any more fun than I could with Jeannie here. - Let go of my girl. - Dickie, wait. Please. Please. Please. Please. Don't be shocked. It's like this. Fred is a very sad man. - Now, you  - Will you let me finish! Because you're a man who doesn't say what you mean very well. What you meant was this was a wonderful evening, and you enjoy my house and you like me. But like you said, you're crude. I'm sorry. Honey, I was only tryin' to be funny. - I thought you said you were trying to be funny. - Well, you go with your You go! If you're in such a damned hurry. My reputation's at stake here! Ah. Good night. Good night, Jeannie. [Whispers] I'm sorry. I don't know how you do it. Well, I just  I just close my eyes, and I  I see how much liquor I can swallow. [Blows Nose] [Sighs] I pray that I'll die and be... martyred by the church for my service to humanity. You're a lovely girl. I'm too old to be lovely. And I haven't got a heart of gold. The nights are long, and Little Orphan Annie of Hard Knocksville gets tough, you know. I think I'd better go. Then go ahead! Get the hell out! Beat it, snowball! - Right? - Right. You're on your own again. [Laughing] Yeah. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. [Door Hinges Squeak] [Woman] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Come here. Well, how did you find that out? It's very important, but I don't think there's anything you can do about it. - Maria, I want to talk to ya. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Louise, I just came home from the office. Yes, I had a very hard day, and something important came up. Can... she call you back later? Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. - [Chuckling] Yeah? Uh-huh. [Laughing] Uh-huh. Louise, we'll call you back later. Good-bye. I'm gonna have a drink. You kill me. - Yeah? Why do I kill ya? - [Laughing] Why do I kill ya? Why do I kill ya, huh? Why? What do you want to drink? Whatever it is, I want it on the rocks, straight and dirty... because I feel very, very bitchy tonight. Well, I feel very, very bitchy too. That makes two of us. Blue Monday for me today. All day the phone rang and rang. "Hello, Maria?" "Good-bye, Maria." - "Hello, darling. Good-bye, darling." - Hello, darling. [Chuckles] - Your sense of humor's going to destroy our marriage someday. - I wasn't trying to be funny. - [Chuckles] - Listen, Maria, go get me a cigarette, will ya? Ooh. We're out. I'm sorry. I smoked myself silly today. - You're such a conformist. - Like hell I am! Dickie, why don't you take me to a movie, okay? - Why doesn't somebody fill these stupid boxes? - You smoke too much. There's a Bergman film in the neighborhood. I don't feel like getting depressed tonight. But you always love foreign film. - Where the hell are the cigarettes? - We're out! - What are you getting so huffy about? - There's nothing on television tonight. If I had a cigarette, I could think. - You're hungry. - Right! But you're always hungry. That's because I always come home at dinnertime. Oh, I love you when you look like that. Look like what? Tell me quick, and I'll write it down. - You wanna fight, huh? - [Giggling] Yeah, I wanna fight. Smug. I knew it the first time I looked at you. - The better-than-you expression. - That's right. - I'm the pompous puke of all times. - Yeah, and you smell like a brewery too. And I smell like a brewery too. And you'll take me to a movie show? I'll... take you... any place that your little heart desires... if you'll just keep that lovely mouth of yours closed for a couple of seconds. I have a lovely dinner for you. Come on. Take off your coat and stay a while, bright eyes. Well, that sounds like some kind of a proposition. Oh, Dickie, you're so innocent, it's hard to get through to you sometimes. - Oh, really? - [Chuckles] - No place like home. - What? - I said have you ever been to Rome? - Italy? [Chuckles] - I love you. - But you always love me when I bring food. - Well, that's because I'm a glutton. - Were you with Fred tonight? - Yeah. - I think he's a terrible father. He never talks to the kids or plays with 'em. The kids are grown up. Nineteen isn't grown. I don't like Fred anymore. - Well, why don't you like Fred anymore? - Because... he cheats on his wife. [Cutlery Clinks] - Now, who told you that? - Louise. Oh, Louise. - Oh. - Fred talks in his sleep. He comes home at night, and he just stares at her. Doesn't say a word. They have a drink. Silence. - They eat, they say nothing. - Salt and pepper, please. They get into bed and they say nothing. And I forgot, he just barely looks at the kids... and Louise says that it's because of that. Because of what? Well, she reads, and he just rolls over and goes to sleep... and talks to all these different girls. And Louise says that they have to be in compromising positions. [Laughing] Good old Freddie. [Chuckling] He says things like  - Like "Roll over." - [Chuckling] "Let's try that again." Yeah. Things like that. Things like that, huh? And do you know what he did with  Do you know what he did with Darlene? Darlene? Who the hell's Darlene? The girl in his dream. Oh. Well, what did he do with Darlene? Huh? [Chuckles] You ain't gonna tell me? [Chuckles] He kiss He kisses her. [Chuckling] You know. Oh. You mean... he goes  [Chuckling] You You mean he goes  [Wheezing Laugh] - Bad! - [Laughing] - Is that what you mean? - No. - No. - [Laughing] - I Yes, but  - [Laughing] He says for her to do it to him. - That's funny. - When he gets  - Well  - Well, that's what he said. Yeah, well, you know, Freddie's getting on in years. And a man Freddie's age  You're Fred's age! Yeah, but sexual nightmares are not one of my problems. Besides, what the hell has that got to do with Fred being a good father? Huh? [Laughing] Well, I  I'm sorry I talk too much. Well, you know, Fred puts up with his kids'asinine friends. - You know that? - I  His kids wanna drink, he lets 'em drink. They want to smoke, he lets them smoke. He Well, he sends the sons of bitches to college. They each have their own cars, you know. And he gives them 50 bucks a week spending money. Can you imagine that? And his daughter is beautiful. His son is a big 6-foot-3 hunk of man... and the girls think he's cute. And he's got Simon, a one-year-old baby. I wish I was that kind of a father. Well, we weren't discussing that part of it anyway. I'm talking about it from a woman's point of view. Ohh. A woman's "taf" you point of [Laughs] [Laughing] A woman's point of view. Oh, God. I can't go to the goddamn movie with you. Jesus Christ Almighty. Oh, boy. [Chuckling] I can I can see it all now. [Laughing] Boy. You know, one of these days... you girls are gonna go, "Charge!" And you know somethin' funny? We'll all surrender, and you can have everything. You can have the house and the cars and the office... and the bills and the headaches... and we'll sit home and laugh! That's what we're gonna do. All we ask for is peace. To give us our daily beating and three square meals a day and bread and water... and we'll just sit staring at the sun... going blind, okay? Oh, I'm so sorry. Do we emasculate you? Poor little boy losing his virility. Well, I don't have it anymore! - What happened to it, huh? - I just don't appeal to you. Oh, you appeal to me all right. When I come home, you appeal to me. - When I'm at the office, you appeal to me. - I am not a sex machine! - No, you want to go to the movies! - Because I'm bored. That's how you get your jollies! - Don't be crude! - Crude, schmude. I'm crude! - The minute you get home, you wanna jump into bed. - That's the general idea.

I wanted him to go to one of those Midwestern schools and play football... but his mother said, "No. No football." So he said, "All right. What the hell. Okay, no football." So instead he goes to Dartmouth. Goes out for tennis instead. All day long he walks around in tennis shoes. What kind of a thing is that for a grown boy to walk around in tennis shoes all day long? What the hell. He's my son. Even if he wants to nance around, I say, "So what?" Everybody's gotta lead their own life, right? So, he goes out for swimming and track... and wears tennis shoes. Jeannie, do you know what it is to be a promo man in a firm like mine, huh? I'll tell ya. You meet more millionaires and more presidents... than you dream could exist. And that seems like a big thing to you, huh? So, what have I got after all those years? A big house, a kooky wife and a kid who wears sneakers. [Laughter] [Chattering] Hey, Jeannie baby! Hey.

It means that your eggs are hot, and they're gonna get cold. You're a lousy cook. Thank you. I love to cook. My mom always told me, "You wanna eat, cook. "Otherwise you'll be skinny. And skinny people are not like fat people. Fat people are jolly." - Right? - Wrong. Skinny people are happy... because they're not fat. Okay, I'll diet. You're not fat. - What? - You're voluptuous. What? I can't hear you, Dickie. Oh. Dishes. Well, that's a negative attitude. - What? Putting on my pants? - Yeah. - Well, I just hate getting out of bed. That's all. - Stop apologizing.

That's good, isn't it? And youyou enjoyed my company too, didn't you? I enjoyed your company. And you said that you trusted me, didn't you? Yes, I did. And you thought Peter Piper was pretty important last night, didn't you? - Didn't you? - Yes, I did. You see? I'm always right. [Raspberry] I listened to your demented dialogue too, didn't I? - Yes, you did. - And I thought you were crazy, didn't I? But I made love to you, and I held you in my arms all night. And if you'd been out in the street last night, they'd have had you committed. Wouldn't they? Right? I suppose so. You son of a gun. How come you hate me now? Jeannie... do me a favor? Don't be silly anymore. Just be yourself. But I am myself. Who else would I be? I'm serious. Definition of"serious." Blah, blah, blah, blah.

'cause I love her so much, and I'll do anything you say, God." And, man, I don't even believe in him, you know. But, I mean, it doesn't matter. I I  We protect ourselves. So, when you talk ethics and values and honesty... and I'm a nice guy and you're a nice guy... and and... this and that, you know, I mean, it just doesn't matter. [Sniffles] Nobody cares. Nobody has the time... to be vulnerable to each other. So... we just go on. I mean, right away our armor comes out like a shield and goes around us... and, uh, we become like mechanical men. Yeah. And I called you a mechanical woman, huh? I got news. I'm so mechanical  Honey, it's absolutely ludicrous how mechanical a person can be. [Imitating Machine] I am the sexiest guy in the world.

That's wonderful. That's, uh, something new. A noble adulteress. I think you ought to be rewarded. I'll write it into a policy. You commit adultery, the adulterer gets killed. The beneficiary, who is the adulteress, gets paid off, right? Dickie, I don't care. Rejected for the thousandth time in 14 years. She doesn't care. All I have to do is find that 10-year-old rapist and kill him. And then you get paid off. You don't need me, you don't need any man. And I'll write the policy. What the hell were you doing? Chasing each other all over the house? You couldn't get laid in bed, so you come down to the kitchen? Then you go up and take a shower to wash off the kitchen? You get laid once and everything is solved! Get all the soldiers in Vietnam laid and the whole Middle East problem is solved! You want violence, huh? You want me to be violent? Is that it? You want me to slap you across the face every time you open your mouth? I hate my life. I just don't love you. Throw me a cigarette, please. A light. My lighter, please.
