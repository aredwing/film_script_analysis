Shall we? - Hi. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. Two years ago I didn't just lose my elder brother in the plane crash in fact, I also lost my best friend, my idol. Few are fortunate to have a brother like Vikram Diwan. I'm sure you must be thinking why I built this hospital in his memory although I am a successful hotelier. I'd like to tell all of you a story. I was 8 and Vikram was 13. He had a friend named Karan. Vikram would spend all time with him and play with him. One day, when I returned from school. Vikram wasn't eating because Karan didn't come home that day. Later, we found out that he was in the hospital. He had a problem with his liver. And there was just one way to save him. And that was to find a donor whose blood group matched with him. Vikram and Karan had the same blood group. Vikram didn't even hesitate once before he decided to donate half of his liver to save his friend. Since that day, Vikram became my role model. He went to great lengths in order to help the needy. And so, every needy person will receive free help at Vikram Diwan Memorial Hospital. This is the first time when I feel I've managed to become somewhat like him. - The News India crew is waiting. - Yeah. Ma'am, the News India crew is ready for the one-on-one interview with you. Is it necessary? No need to worry. Just be honest. Yes. Hello, this is Priya Verma from News India. On today's special program we'll talk about women's empowerment. We are reporting live from Vikram Diwan Memorial Super-Specialty Hospital that was inaugurated moments ago. Our special guest for the day is the woman that helped Aditya Diwan in fulfilling his dreams. Mrs. Siya Diwan. First of all, hearty congratulations on the inauguration of this hospital. Thank you. They say behind every successful man is a woman. So are you the woman behind Aditya Diwan's success? I don't think so! I don't think a woman ever stays in shadows. So I would rather say that I am the woman who has always been besides the successful Aditya Diwan and not behind him. Mrs. Diwan, one of the responsibilities of the press is to destroy rumors. We heard that prior to your marriage you had an affair with Aditya's elder brother Vikram. Is this true or not? Yes, it's true. And it's not a rumor. When Vikram died I was pregnant with his child. But we weren't married yet. And Aditya didn't want Vikram's child to stay devoid of his family name. That's why he married me. But after sometime I suffered a miscarriage. And I lost my baby, too. Maybe God didn't want me to keep any memento from my past. But God made sure that a nice man like Aditya becomes my companion so that I can move on in life. "I'm obsessed to make you mine." "Since long." "Make me a bad habit" "is what I have to say to you." "Let a wave of sensation run down" "my otherwise calm body." "Let me stare into those" "mesmerizing eyes that are as deep as an abyss." "Let's get wet in the deluge of desires." "Come.." "I'm obsessed with never letting you go ever." "Since long." "Let me dwell in your eyes" "is what I have to say to you." "Don't stop me." "I am completely obsessed now." "That's how crazy I am." "Take a look at me." "I'm suffering too." "I'm completely shattered to pieces." "There's no turning back now." "Whatever this is, it feels right." "Come.." "I'm obsessed with becoming one with you." "Since long." "Let me stay close to you" "is what I have to say to you." "I'm obsessed to make you mine." "Since long." "I'm obsessed since long." The Hong Kong delegates are on their way from the airport. And they'll be here in 15 minutes. Thank you, sir. Kaaya, I want you to head this meeting. Aditya, this deal is worth 5 billion. And if anything goes wrong our company will never be able to bear the loss. And I think I'm not yet capable. Kaaya, I know you're more capable than you think you are. Two years ago, you joined this company as a secretary. And now you're perfectly handling all my big companies. And let's not forget you did splendid job with our soft drink department which has increased our sales by seven fold. So now go ahead and head the meeting. All the best. I don't know how to thank you, but.. Thank you. I can't believe my eyes. What did you possibly see, Mr. Vaswani? It's hard to believe that a random person can gift you something so expensive. What gift? Show me. Sir, it's as big as it's expensive. What? I mean, you must come down to see it for yourself. Who is it, sir? Find out. Saurav Singhania. Never heard of him before. What does he do? Vaswani was saying he's the owner of some group of international funds. And also owns a few iron and steel factories. Impressive. And the reason for this favor. I've accepted his lunch invitation to find that out. Lunch invitation? He has invited us both at his office. - You'll come along, right? - No. Why? What will I do out there? And anyway, these business meetings are very boring. I see. Are you trying to tell me you don't want to meet a person who gifts an Audi to someone he doesn't know. I would.. By the way, is he handsome? Handsome is as handsome does. Welcome! Welcome to my kingdom! Thank you for accepting my invitation. Thank you for inviting us. Pleasure is all mine. This is Mr. Dixit. He looks after my entire business. You must be wondering why I was so eager to meet you two. Well, I have something to show you. I guess even we don't know this much about ourselves. May I ask why you're so interested in our lives? You can say that I'm a big fan of yours. Only film stars and cricketers have fans in this country, Mr. Singhania. This is the first time when I heard that even businessmen have fans. Well, actually I'm a fan of every person who achieved something in life on their own. You expanded your business so rapidly after losing your father and elder brother. It's remarkable. You have really great business sense. We were supposed to talk business. Yes. Is it okay if I borrow your husband for a minute? Sure. Mr. Dixit, show Mrs. Siya around the office. Please. Let's have a drink. Scotch. Vodka. Bourbon. - Malt. - Excellent. Do you know the difference between birds and humans? Birds build a nest just big enough for them. And humans.. Well, humans are never happy with their home. They want to make it bigger. Like I am sure you want to expand your business as well. And I want to help you fulfill this dream. I'll give you all the money you need. Diwan is a big name and every bank and financial institution lineup at my door to lend us money. Cheers. See that's true. But for the money you borrow you'll have to mortgage your property and pay interest. Every creditor does that. But not me. With me, there's no guarantee. No mortgage. No interest. Are you out of your mind? You'll lend me money without any guarantee or interest? And whatever amount you want. But why will you do it? Why just you? Why would anyone do such a thing? I don't know about the rest but I am a businessman. And this is a business deal. What deal? This is a signed check. You can fill in whatever amount you like. Just send Siya over for one night. You rascal! I will kill you. How dare you! No one has dared to mention Siya in front of me. Don't make this mistake again or else next time, you won't get time to regret. You're new to this city. Take my advice and leave. As long as Aditya Diwan is here you can't even breathe let alone do your business. We shall see. We shall. Siya, let's go. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Let's just go. Aditya, what happened? The game's begun. Couldn't you see before opening the door? This isn't obstruction it's a door to a better future, Satya. How do you know my name? Your brother Raghunath Kamath is in jail, isn't he? - Yes, but how do you know? - Never mind. Look, your brother's bail papers. You must do something for me if you want to see your brother free. What is it? - More. - Yeah. Go ahead, I'll join you later. What's wrong? Aren't you coming along for lunch? No, Mr. Akash asked me to do something. I'll go deal with that first. Go ahead, I'm coming. - I'll go. Don't be late. - Yes. You gave 21 runs in an over. But you were clean bowled by me. - Shut up. - Harshit. - Harshit. - Harshit. - What happened? - Harshit. Harshit. - What happened? - Harshit. What's wrong? - Tell us. Yes, sir. Right, sir. Okay, that will be done, sir. Thank you, sir. Right. - Aditya! Something's definitely wrong. We're receiving many complaints regarding our soft drinks. What complaints? Some kids started puking after drinking our soft-drinks and some fell sick. And our sources in the secretariat have informed us that there's going to be an inquiry. And I just don't understand how is that possible! - Aditya Diwan. - Down! Down! - Aditya Diwan. - Down! Down! - Aditya Diwan. - Down! Down! Please stay back. Please. - Please stay back. - Down with Aditya Diwan. - I said stay back. - Down with Aditya Diwan. Stay back. Move back. Move. Move. Stay back. Stay back. Move. Stop making this poison! Shut it down! Stop making this poison! Shut it down! Stop making this poison! Shut it down! Mr. Aditya Diwan we must take the latest batch of your soft drinks to our Lab for testing. And you must shut down your factory until we don't get the results. Shut it down! Shut it down! Okay, inspector. Even I don't want anyone falling sick after drinking this. - I am ready to cooperate. - Thank you. Officer. Down with Aditya Diwan! 'These people only know how to make profit.' 'They would even sell poison if they profited from it.' 'They are selling us poison.' 'Such people should be hanged.' 'As you can see the huge crowd' 'gathered behind us and they're clearly furious.' 'Police have sent the latest batch for testing..' - Hello. - Hello, Ms. Siya. Who is this? What? You forgot me so soon? Saurav Singhania. Yes. How did you like my second gift? Gift? What gift? Oh, so Aditya didn't tell you anything. About what? The thing that can solve all your problems. Hatred can turn into love if.. Only if you want.. What do you mean? Actually, you should ask your husband. He'll tell you. You were all over the news today. You must be really worried. Part of the job. Keeping things from me must also be part of your job, right? What? What did I hide from you? You never told me what happened between. Saurav Singhania and you that day? He's crazy. Stop thinking about him. He's done all this! What? Everything that's happening in our soft-drink factory. It's a sabotage. He's behind it all. - Who told you? - He told me. - He called. - What did he say? That you know why he's making our lives miserable. And only I can make it all go away. Siya, just forget it. Why? What does he want? - Why don't you tell me? - I can't tell you. Aditya, please! Tell me. He wants to spend a night with you. That's what that crook wants. And that's why he's.. Siya.. He's a vulgar rascal with a lot of money. No Aditya, that can't be the only reason. I am sure there's something more to it. Maybe he's saying all this to provoke you, confuse you and hiding his true motive. Find out, Aditya. Find out! "Never last, never last, can you come on top?" "Never last, never last.." "Check this out." "When I don't get the liberty" "to touch you." "When I don't get the liberty to touch you." "I get that liberty in my dreams." "But even in my dreams when I try to touch you." "I wake up." "Aren't you ashamed of talking dirty like this?" "Don't your mom and your sister teach you anything?" "My reputation isn't tarnished, thank the Lord" "that you wake up." "Meet Bros." "Meet Bros." "Let me touch your body and it'll change your gait." "Touch my lips with yours" "and it'll melt your heart." "Ignore these shenanigans and fill my arms." "Forget all your worries, and let's enjoy life." "I can understand your naughty behavior." "Don't your mom and your sister teach you anything?" "My reputation isn't tarnished, thank the Lord" "that you wake up." "Your kiss is really killer." "I hope it doesn't turn into a love-bite." "I am scared of your intentions." "You might turn my days into nights." "Stop flirting" "why are you after me?" "I know how to cure your fever of love." "Why do you make promises and break it every day." "And come in my dreams to lure my heart again." "But even in my dreams when I try to touch you." "I wake up." This soft-drink incident has ruined the image of our other companies. Not only did we have to stop production in fact, we had to call back the stock in the market as well. There must be a way. There is one. What's that? Vaswani. - Aditya. - Look, Kaaya. I want you to resign and take the blame. This is the only way to save our companies from total annihilation. You know I am innocent. I didn't do anything. I know. But someone other than me will have to take responsibility. I can't trust anyone else. The company will take good care of you. You will keep getting your salary. In fact for lifetime. And the law can't touch you. We'll get the best team for your case. And what if I don't agree? Sorry, you have no choice. The company has already released a press statement stating that you're responsible for everything. You know what, Aditya? You're a real crook. And I don't need your fake sympathy. And yes, keep the salary for yourself. You might need it. Stop. Stop. Ms. Kaaya, did you already know that the cold drink wasn't fit for drinking? - Ma'am, please tell us.. - They still haven't recovered.. Aditya has foiled your plans by blaming Kaaya for everything. This is the just the beginning. How long can he hide behind innocent women? We have to go to Malaysia for the Business Chamber Summit. I think we should leave. This girl, Kaaya. Call her, I want to talk business with her. Welcome. Thank you. - I am Dixit. - Hi. I hope you had a pleasant journey. Everything was fine. - Please come. - Thank you. Please come. I'll show you your room. Please come. Mr. Singhania is really happy that you accepted his invitation. But he's also apologized. He couldn't receive you personally because he was busy in his meetings. It's okay, I can understand. Mr. Singhania would like you to have dinner with him tonight. - Of course. - Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Thank you for accepting my invitation. Thank you for this beautiful evening. I believe if you put your heart into something the result is always beautiful. True. I want to offer you something. From my heart.. Friendship. I don't make friends that quickly. And anyway, you're not interested in my friendship. What do you mean? Just that I know you want to use me to ruin Aditya Diwan. After all, the enemy of my enemy is a friend. Wow. Beauty and brains. You must be very dangerous. Not as dangerous as you. But my brains tell me that you're ready to pay any price for this. But Mr. Singhania, I am not for sale. Who are you still being loyal to, Kaaya? Someone who humiliated you and have you thrown out of his company. I don't think about profit and loss while making friends. What's done is done. Anyway, what's the offer? Double of whatever Aditya's giving you. Not interested. - Four times more. - Not interested! Any figure you want, tell me. No. You wouldn't have come here if you weren't interested in my offer. And it's impossible that you're uninterested in my offer after coming here. That only means that I am asking the wrong question. The right question is what do you want? I have a morning flight. And you have until tomorrow morning to figure out what I want. Good night. I hope you liked our hospitality. It was better than I expected. - Thank you. - Yes. I wanted you to be my guest a little longer. But you were right. No one can put a price tag on our friendship. It's alright. Thank you for the wonderful stay. Aditya killed my sister. Our parents died in a car crash when we were young. Since then I raised Sangeeta as my daughter. She met Aditya in college. And they became friends. Soon their friendship blossomed into love. Aditya meant everything to Sangeeta. But he.. He just used her like a slave. Sangeeta couldn't tolerate this and she killed herself by consuming poison. I still remember the night when I rushed to her room. My sister died right in my arms. That day I decided. That no matter what. I will destroy Aditya Diwan. If you know the price of my friendship you should know I can even die for you. This hard disk has all the information about Aditya's business. It will help you to destroy him. Thank you. And yes, my motive behind coming here was to know the reason behind your silence. And now this reason has compelled me to know you better. "Give me. Give me, give me love." "Then give me more." "Take some love from me too." "My lover gave you down and I feeling low." "Again and again and again." "What's danger, what danger, what danger." "Take me down, down, down." "What's danger, what danger, what danger." "Take me down, down, down." "Take me down, down, down." "Take me down, down, down." "Show me that you can love." "O Baby, take me in your arms." "Everything I ever imagined in my dreams." "O baby, just do all that." "Show me that you can love." "O Baby, take me in your arms." "Everything I ever imagined in my dreams." "O baby, just do all that." "You're my love." "You're my intoxication of nights." "You're my love." "Arouse my body in slumber." "You're my love." "You're my intoxication of nights." "You're my love." "Arouse my sleeping body." "That's reason that I cannot love no other." "My love." "This life I'm gonna live it longer." "My love." "Under your spell, girl. I'm down under." "My love." "I keep coming back for more and more and more." "That's reason that I cannot love no other." "My love." "This life I'm gonna live it longer." "My love." "Under your spell, girl. I'm down under." "My love." "I keep coming back for more and more and more." "Your crazy eyes touched me in this dark night." "Something happened to me and my breath." "Your crazy eyes touched me in this dark night." "Something sizzled down my lazy breath." "You're my love." "You're my intoxication of nights." "You're my love." "Arouse my body in slumber." "You're my love." "You're my intoxication of nights." "You're my love." "Arouse my body in slumber." "This winter feels so hot." "There's no shame anywhere." "Sweetheart, we've made a legitimate mistake." "This winter feels so hot." "There's no shame anywhere." "Sweetheart, we've made a legitimate mistake." "Let me make things hot for you." "Bring my lips close to yours." "Everything I ever imagined in my dreams." "Just do all that." "You're my love." "You're my intoxication of nights." "You're my love." "Arouse my body in slumber." "You're my love." "You're my intoxication of nights." "You're my love." "Arouse my body in slumber." "You're my intoxication of nights." "Arouse my body in slumber." - Hello. - Hello. Yeah, Kaaya, tell me. Aditya's having his breakfast. Okay, put me on speaker. I don't have time. Quick. Yeah, Kaaya. Go ahead. Aditya, the information I gave Saurav - won't harm us in any way. - Good. But I found out something very important. What's that? Do you know a girl called Sangeeta who went to the same college as you? Yes, I remember. There was a girl. Yes. And you two loved each other. What nonsense! She loved me, but not me. She was a mad girl, you know. Obsessive. She committed suicide. She gave up her life for you. What? I don't know anything about this. Yes. And Saurav Singhania is Sangeeta's brother. - What? - Yes. And he wants to ruin you in order to avenge his sister's death. Now it all makes sense to me. Don't forget to clone Saurav's phone. - And keep informing me. - Okay. You were right, Siya. This a revenge story. He's not just a rich vulgar rascal. But a rich vulgar cunning rascal. But Aditya, if all this is just a misunderstanding then why don't you just clear it out? But that won't make a difference, Siya. If we want to stop Saurav then we'll have to play this game his way. What? Persuasion. Bribe. Punishment and divide. - Vaswani. - Yes, sir. There was a girl called Sangeeta who studied in my college with me. - Yes. I want her brother's entire life history. Okay, sir. If he knows everything about us then we must also know everything about him. - Do you have to go? - I don't want to either. But I haven't met mom for a long time now. She's missing me. I've lost my heart to you. I can't bear you going away. Promise me, you'll come back soon. Promise me. I promise. It's time for my flight and your meeting. Shall we? Saurav has entrapped Kaaya. We're getting the information we want. The plan is working. I got the phone. Now listen to me very carefully. First, remove SIM card from Saurav's phone. Done. Next attach the SIM card to the SIM reader. Just like we attach the SIM card in the mobile phone. Done. Now attach the SIM reader to the adapter. And attach the adapter to your phone. As soon as you do that you'll see a pop-up window on your phone. It's giving me an option, 'Yes or No'. Press 'Yes' and wait 10 seconds for the process to complete. As soon as the process completes, press Ok. I hope she does it. Come on! Yes, Mr. Singhania, how can I be at service? Fool. I've told you a thousand times whenever we speak on phone, we won't say each other's name. - Sorry, sir. - Now listen to me carefully. According to your source. Aditya's company has invested a lot of money in the Telecommunication's Bill which will soon be passed by the Parliament. And if this is okayed, Aditya's company will make a fortune. - Right? - Yes, the information is right. And if the Bill is rejected then.. His company will incur huge losses - and will have to be shut down. - Of course. Exactly. So this Bill should get rejected. But sir, what will you gain from all this? You can say that I stand to gain from Aditya's losses. I get it, sir. Don't worry. This Bill will never get through. How does he know all this? Everyone's got money to bribe. Aditya, what will you do now? Aditya Diwan speaking. Mr. Aditya, don't embarrass me by saying your name. - Do you remember your promise? - Of course I do. Don't worry. I've the biggest number of MPs. The Bill will be approved by tomorrow morning. That's fine, buy 10 more MPs. There's no need for that. I know, but I still don't want to take a chance. I'm sending over more money. Fine, as you wish. Let's see what Saurav Singhania does now? Hello. Kaaya. We need to deliver 500 million to telecommunication Minister Dutta's home. Give this job to someone trustworthy. Don't worry. I've confirmed from my sources. That Bill will never get approval. And as for the plan ahead it's already begun. You know what to do. Just be careful. Don't worry, ma'am. I've done this before. And yes, switch off your phone for safety. So that no one can track you. - Yes, madam. - Leave. - Sir, we've made a big mistake. - What's wrong? Saurav Singhania is not Sangeeta's brother. - What? - Yes, sir. Her brother passed away five years ago in a car accident. He lied to Kaaya to mislead her. And we were celebrating that we'll get all the information through Kaaya. This means, he already knew that we sent Kaaya. Yes. Oh my God! Vaswani, we must stop the money we sent to Dutta at any cost! Yes, sir. - Hello. - I was about to call you. The money's on the way. - Stop it at all cost. - What? Aditya, the truck left 15 minutes ago. And his phone's switched off too. Stop him at all cost. It's a trap! Trap? What trap? Kaaya, this is not the time to explain everything. Just chase the money and stop it! Mr. Dutta. Mr. Dutta is speaking to the PM on the other line. Please call later. I must speak to Mr. Dutta immediately. Tell him it's Aditya Diwan calling. Sir, no one's more important than the Prime Minister. I'll call you when he's free. Hello. Idiot! Pick up the goddamn phone. Pick up the phone. These businessmen only care about themselves. Hello, sir. The Minister's still busy. I'll ask him to call you. You idiot, I told you it's urgent. Give the phone to Mr. Dutta immediately. I need to speak to him right now. Hello! Hello! Damn! Where are you going? Tell Mr. Dutta that his package has arrived. - Watchman, let him through. - Fine, go. Come on. Straight. - Get down. - Why, sir? Get down. - It's only mangoes. - Mangoes. - Show me. - Come, sir. - Let me show you. - What's inside? Open these crates. Come on. - Sir.. - Where? I don't know whose it is. 'As Telecommunication Minister Dutta' 'was arrested red-handed taking bribe' 'the Home Minister, Delhi has withdrawn' 'his proposed Telecommunication Bill from the parliament.' 'And he has also said' 'that he's appointing a fast-track enquiry commission' 'regarding Dutta's bribe case.' 'According to our sources' 'the Delhi Home Ministry has stated' 'that till the enquiry commission submits its report' 'the telecommunication bill won't be..' No! - Aditya, listen to me. Calm down! - Rascal! Calm down, Aditya, listen to me. That Saurav! I will destroy him! Well, here I am, Mr. Diwan. Now destroy me. Who the hell are you? Why are you doing this? So you know that my name isn't Saurav. So let's say I am Gaurav. - How's that? - I am not a fool. I don't know why you're doing all this. But I know you're trying to ruin me and I won't let that happen. Listen to that. So you haven't understood anything yet. Siya, please explain your husband. I mean there's no point in ruining your whole life for just one demand. - You rascal. - Aditya. Aditya, let go. I only believe in love and not violence. You got the wrong guy. Whoever you are, I will find out the truth even if I have to risk my life for it. I'll find out who you are and I'll destroy you. I will finish you! You're a strange man. So you'd rather give your life and not your consent to this union. Now this is going to be fun. Because I never quit and you don't want to quit. So we must wait and watch who wins. Because both of us can't win. And I'm loving this. Please! Please! Please! Please! Please calm down everyone! The Minister is on his way. He'll present his side of story in detail. After that if anyone has any questions then he can ask them. Please be patient. Move please. Stay back. Back. Move aside. I would like to clearly state that the truck carrying cash seized by the CBI outside my home is that I have no connection to that money. Nor do I know anything about it. Why? Who? And what this money was sent for? Mr. Minister, the truck was seized outside your home. So it was meant for you, right? If there's a buffalo standing outside your home will that make the buffalo yours? According to our sources this money was sent to buy out few MPs. Is it true? Please think before you ask question. Everyone knows our party has a majority in the Parliament. So why would we buy out MPs from other parties? Who does the money belong to? The police are carrying out an investigation. 'But according to my experience in politics' 'I can definitely say that a businessman friend' 'of the opposite party is trying to instigate me.' 'Excuse me.' 'Thank you.' Sir, by telling the media that this can be the job of an industrialist. Dutta has tied the noose around you. And now he can stoop to any level in order to save his reputation and post. Sir, could it be possible that Saurav has joined hands with the Minister. Kill that Saurav. Finish him, I don't care. Just finish that rascal. Aditya. In order to get out of this situation before we kill Saurav, we must find out how he knew that we sent Kaaya. Where's Kaaya? I don't know, sir. I've been trying to call her, but her phone's switched off. I don't know where she is. "How did this happen?" "How did this happen?" "How did this happen?" "How did this happen?" "Whenever I think of you it only makes me cry." "O tormentor you should know" "I love to hate you, baby." "Whenever I think of you it only makes me cry." "O tormentor you should know" "I love to hate you, baby." "I love to hate you, baby." "I love to hate you, baby." "Why did you.." "Why did you listen to your mom?" "When I used to say that my heaven's at your feet." "Why did you.." "Why did you listen to your mom?" "When I used to say that my heaven's at your feet." "Why did I stay quiet?" "Why didn't I scream I say?" "Every time you tormented me." "I love to hate you, baby." "I love to hate you, baby." "I love to hate you, baby." Kaaya! Kaaya! You're a cheat. I love you and you stab me in the back. And you take the knife and stab me back. I missed you. Look, I was only following Aditya's instructions. You win and I lose. Please let me go. Don't worry. I am not Aditya. I won't show you dreams of heaven and throw you in hell. But the choice is yours. If you want you can be with me again. Close to me. I haven't forgotten our nights together. Or you can stay in jail with convicts like you. And they too I'm sure will give you many-many nights that you'll never forget. Almost forgot. I want you to hear something. 'Hello.' 'Kaaya.' 'We need to deliver 500 million' 'to Telecommunication's Minister Dutta's home.' 'Give this job to someone trustworthy.' 'Don't worry.' You thought only you can tap phones and record calls. What's the first rule of enmity? Never, ever, ever underestimate your enemy. Never underestimate your enemy. And this dialogue's repeated in every movie. Really. Shame on you. I could've released this recording to the media. Or handed it over to the police. But I know you're just a pawn in this game. And so I want to give you a chance to save yourself from all this. What say? Do you want to clear out of this? What do you want? Kaaya. Hello, Kaaya. Where have you been? Aditya, I am tired. First, the soft drink factory case and now the Communication's Bill. How long are you going to use me for your profit? I want out. Please protect me. I am tired, Aditya. I am tired. Come back to Mumbai, Kaaya. We'll work something out, yeah? No! No more deals! I just want a letter of assurance stating that I've nothing to with these incidents. - That's it. - Don't you trust me, Kaaya? No, I don't trust anyone! If you don't help me and give me that letter I'll tell the press that you tried to bribe the Minister. It's simple, Aditya. If I go down I'll take you with me. Damn it! And the award goes to Kaaya! Kaaya, you're so beautiful, so talented, so dangerous. You should've been an actor! Really. Okay, enough. I am sorry. Please stop crying. Please. Please stop. I told you I am with you. Enough. You're my responsibility now. That's it. - We're one team, right? - Yeah! We're one team. Do come in my dreams and tell me if there's life after death. Okay? Take care of this. Kaaya is dead. Aditya. This wasn't Kaaya. What do you mean? I mean, it was Kaaya speaking but the words were not hers. I am a woman. I can sense it. You mean Saurav Singhania. Yes. I think he's trying to use her against us. Ms. Siya is absolutely right, sir. He's trying to set you up in a bigger mess. Take my advice, sir. Siya and you must leave India for few days. Vaswani, what are you trying.. Sir, I am well-versed with the law of the land. Please take my advice and leave for USA tonight. I'll make all the arrangements. I am not a coward. I am not going anywhere. - Sir.. - Aditya. Vaswani is right. We need to retreat to think clearly. Let's go. Hello. It's done. - Come on, have some. - Of course. Yes, Mr. Singhania. I told you I am the only man who can get you out of this quagmire. You don't need to worry now. Mr. Singhania, I never doubted your ability. So I expect you'll keep your end of the promise. Of course, Mr. Singhania. Of course. I am sorry, Mr. Diwan. You're under arrest. How dare you touch me! I am no petty thief whom an ordinary cop like you can touch. My name's Aditya Diwan. Do you know who I am? I do. And I also know that you've been charged with the murder of Ms. Kaaya Sharma. What? On the day of the first hearing we've received information that the police have found Kaaya Sharma's body few miles outside Mumbai, from a deserted road. Murder mixed with politics. Well yes, this happens to be one of the biggest cases this year. And as you can see right behind me we're outside this court bringing to you every single update. This case looks quite interesting even before it started. Stay back. Stay back everyone. Sir, we have a question, sir. What's your connection to Kaaya Sharma's murder? - Sir.. Do you have anything to do with Kaaya Sharma's murder case, sir? - Sir.. - Please answer us. Sir, please. Sir, please. Please answer us. Sir, please. You have to answer. Please be seated. Mr. Public Prosecutor, you may proceed. Your Honor, right from pesticide being found in Mr. Aditya Diwan's soft drink factory to the Telecommunication Bill. Mr. Aditya Diwan used Ms. Kaaya cunningly. When Mr. Diwan felt that she's becoming a threat for him or his business then Mr. Diwan got rid of her. Your Honor this is not a case. It's just a bail application hearing. Whether my client, Mr. Aditya Diwan is guilty or not we'll find that out later. Mr. Prosecutor, can you prove here that Mr. Diwan is involved in this murder and he needs to be questioned? Your Honor, I have evidence to prove all the facts. My Lord, this is the recording of two telephonic conversations that happened between Mr. Aditya and Ms. Kaaya Sharma. Along with the lab certificate which proves that these are Mr. Aditya Diwan and Ms. Kaaya Sharma's voices. - 'Hello. - Kaaya.' 'We need to deliver 500 million' 'to Telecommunication Minister Dutta's home.' 'Give this job to someone trustworthy.' 'Don't worry.' Order! Order! Silence please. My Lord, this is the second recording which proves that Ms. Kaaya was tired of all this and wanted to stay away from everything. 'Hello, Kaaya, where have you been?' 'Aditya, I am tired.' 'First the soft drink factory case' 'and now the Communication's Bill.' 'How long are you going to use me for your profit?' 'I want out.' 'Please protect me.' 'I am tired, Aditya. I am tired.' 'Kaaya, come back to Mumbai. We'll work out something, yeah?' 'No, I don't trust anyone! It's simple, Aditya.' 'If I go down I'll take you with me.' My Lord, we're worried that Mr. Aditya Diwan can tamper with evidence and intimidate the witnesses. So I request the court that Mr. Aditya Diwan shouldn't be granted bail until the police doesn't complete their investigation. That's all, Your Honor. After listening to all the arguments the court orders Aditya Diwan to be remanded in police custody until the police conducts its investigation. Move. Step back. Is it true that you murdered Kaaya Sharma? Move. Are there more people involved in this? The evidence is against you. How can you run from here? How are you connected to Kaaya Murder case? Please tell us. Mr. Diwan, what secrets did Kaaya know about you? Please tell us. - Sir.. - Move. Let him go. 'My faith in the law of this country has been restored.' 'The opposition has used one of their industrialist friend' 'in order to humiliate me.' 'What's his name?' 'Aditya Diwan?' 'Yes, Aditya Diwan.' 'This is the first time I even heard his name.' 'But I promise' 'I'll take strict actions against him' 'and he'll never forget my name.' This politician is a rascal. We helped him attain power and now he'll use Mr. Aditya as a pawn for his politics and sacrifice him in order to save his post. He won't let him come out of jail. I don't know what to do. You only have five minutes. Siya, tell Vaswani to get the best legal team. Get me out of here soon. Just get me out of this goddamn place. I will handle that, but.. But what? After you left, outside the court.. You know, I can get your husband out of jail if you want. But you see my wishes alone don't count. You should too. Rascal! Siya, listen to me carefully. Even if I'm jailed for life you won't let that Saurav intimidate you. Promise me! Just promise me! You took really long to get here. You win. I don't know why you're doing this. But tonight, I.. I don't know what happiness you get by taking advantage of someone's helplessness. But I want evidence to prove Aditya innocent. My father used to tell me. No one gets rich easily. Behind every fortune, there's a crime. You're not helpless nor am I. I don't know what you're talking about! That's all right. And anyway, you didn't come here to debate. So why are we getting into a debate, right. We should do what you're here for. So come on. Seduce me. I am not a slave whom you paid to make you happy. I don't please for money. No one really does it for money. Even a prostitute doesn't charge you for sex. In fact, she charges you for leaving your bed after the sex. You can leave too with the evidence. You're a cheap rascal! Here you go. It'll help you. See, the way I see it you've only two choices. Either you be a slave or you be a widow. "How do I say how restless I am in your love?" "I want to look in your eyes and steal your dreams." "How do I say how restless I am in your love?" "I want to look in your eyes and steal your dreams." "That's my shadow" "the place where you're standing now." "I am alive" "and the reason is you." "I am alive" "and the reason is you." "It's an intoxication, it's a poison." "What do we call this love?" "What do we call this love?" "It's an intoxication, it's a poison." "What do we call this love?" "There's a saga that's been incomplete for a long." "Let's complete it." "How can I forget you?" "You're my first mistake." "I am alive" "and the reason is you." "You don't know my intentions." "I'll steal your breath." "My heart's telling me to be a criminal." "There's peace beyond these crimes." "I am the lost night" "and you're my pleasant morning." "I am alive" "and the reason is you." I want evidence of Aditya's innocence. What's the hurry? What are you thinking? It's been three months since papa died. The lawyer is going to read out his will soon. Just scared that papa didn't give me any responsibility that I can't handle. Don't worry I'm sure papa didn't give you any responsibility that you can't handle. Brother, you're not dressed yet. - We're getting late. - 10 minutes. With everyone's permission I would like to start reading this will. I, Raghavendra Diwan am making this will in complete senses and not under anyone's pressure. I believe if Diwan Group of Companies wants to achieve new heights of success then it needs experience as well as zest. And so I consider myself fortunate that I have two sons who trust and love each other. Vikram and Aditya. I want my elder son Vikram Diwan to be the heir to all my properties and the chairman to Diwan Group of Companies. And my younger son Aditya Diwan will become the vice president. - Congratulations. - Thank you. We'll do as papa wanted. I am so happy. Congratulations, Mr. Chairman. - I am so, so happy today. - Thank you. Aditya, I am sure there's an informer in our boardroom. How else did Siya know that I am the chairman starting today? It must be that Vaswani. 'Madam, I got some good news.' It's him, isn't it? Aditya, you're so mean. - Yes, it was Vaswani. - Okay. Now come on, will you give me a hug or not. Yeah. And on this joyous occasion, tonight there's a celebration. A party. Now run to the salon and I'll pick you up at 8. Okay? See you. Vikram, you're 15 minutes early. I am still getting ready. You cheat! You were showering him with your love today, weren't you? Since he became the chairman and took over the property you showed your true colors. Now I understand your true plan. First, please both the brothers. And then find your happiness with the richer one. Are you crazy? You know I love you. And it was your decision to hide our affair. We decided to fall in love not to make deals in love. You think I am making a deal? So? If you really love me then prove it to me. Prove that you're not in this for the money. Tonight, after the party you'll come with me to my bedroom. And if you don't do it then I promise you I'll never see your face again. If you're not with me you're against me. - Hey. - Congratulations. Thank you. - Hi, Aditya. - Hi. Where's Vikram? The host is late at his own party. - This is not fair. - Cheers. - Hi. - Hi. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Hello, Aditya. Where's Vikram? He'll be here soon. No, he's already here. There he is! The man of the moment. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Hi, Siya. Hi. Meet Mr. Mehta. - Old associate of ours. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm fine. Thank you. - How are you? - All okay. Everybody, may I have your attention please. Thank you. Where's Aditya? Aditya. Aditya. There he is. Come here. - Yeah. - My handsome younger brother. First of all, both of us want to thank you, all of you. For making it here at such a short notice. By coming here, all of you proved that what our papa said was right. He always said that 'friends can make you feel happiest in the world'. And we're very fortunate that we have so many friends to be a part of our happiness. So thank you, all of you. But.. There's someone here who can add to our happiness. Siya, you know I love you a lot. And I know I'll never be happy without you. So why don't we live together forever and make each other happy? Will you marry me? - Oh come on, say yes. - Say yes. Say yes. - Say yes. - Say yes! Come on. Say yes. Yes! Siya. Don't doubt me so much. How many times do I tell you that I only love you. I can't live without you. If that's true then help me kill Vikram. What? Aditya.. Aditya, I.. I cannot kill anyone. I can't do it. Strange love! You don't want to see your lover happy. What happiness will you get by killing your elder brother? He's not my elder brother. He's my enemy. He snatched away everything I ever wanted. Mom's favorite son. Dad's respect. School, college, studies, sports.. He was better than me in everything. When I fell for you, he snatched you too. I am tired of being no.2. I want to be no.1. I want to be the best. Enough. Enough! I won't get anything as long as he's alive. I want to be the chairman. The owner. Are you with me or not? Are you with me or not? Definitely I will. Okay. Anyway, let's meet and talk. Okay, see you, bro. Thanks. See you. Neha, inform the pilot that we're ready. Okay, sir. - I am gonna miss you so much. - I'll miss you too. See you. You're alive but your face. How's it possible? How can anyone survive such a plane crash? That's why, no body was found. And with plastic surgery.. I can't believe it. Look Vikram, this is not my fault. Just shut up. I didn't want to spend a moment with you. I still don't. I did this to show you the truth. And anyway you were always so cheap and you still are. Only your price has changed. What's this? With these papers you must return everything that you and your husband took from me. You want evidence for Aditya's innocence, don't you? I think you should get going. How is that possible? Saurav is Vikram. - Are you sure? - Yes, Aditya. The tattoo and everything that I only told Vikram. He knows everything. He's definitely Vikram. Sometimes I feel. God's definitely against me. Some game He's playing with me. I can hear Him laughing. He wants you to sign these papers and return him his properties, business, everything. Only then will he handover the evidence of your innocence. He has played a really big plan. Our plans are foiled. What do we do now, Aditya? I won't let God win. He might have saved Vikram and got me locked up behind bars and turned the world against me but I will win. Aditya, please. You're scaring me now. You are not a loser if you fall. You are a loser if you don't get up. It's time to rise up in this game, Siya. Here are the papers. First handover the evidence of Aditya's innocence. Shucks.. - Let me check the papers first. - Yes. What kind of a joke is this? Where are his signatures? Your finger is bleeding. Saurav! Saurav! Saurav! Saurav! What's wrong? Saurav! Are you okay? Saurav! Are you okay? Saurav! Saurav! What did you do to him? Saurav! Saurav! Saurav! My dear Saurav! Saurav! Saurav! Saurav, are you okay? Saurav! Saurav! Mr. Dixit, he'll be dead in an hour. By the time, you take him to the hospital they conduct the tests and give him an antidote it'll be too late. So what do we do? - There's one way. - Yes. If I tell you what poison it is. Tell me! Tell me! But for that, without wasting his time you must right away handover all the evidence of Aditya's innocence. Come on, be quick for his sake. Saurav, just be there. Saurav, just be there. Here. Tell me the name. Saurav! Saurav! Saurav! Tell me the name. Saurav! Saurav! You'll be all right. Belladonna. Saurav. You'll be all right. Saurav! Saurav! Mr. Dixit. Mr. Dixit. Yes, doctor. We've given Mr. Singhania the antidote. But for the next 12 hours I can't promise anything. Anything is possible. And we don't know whether it has affected any organ. Only time can tell. Don't worry. 'The air pressure over the Arabian sea is decreasing.' 'Due to which the weather is changing.' 'If we talk about North India' 'entire Northern region of India' 'has been impacted by cold waves as we speak.' 'Due to heavy snowfalls in Srinagar' 'the temperature has dipped below minus 3 degrees.' 'Breaking News of the hour is' 'that Kaaya Sharma's real murderer has been found.' 'The police recently recovered' 'the body of a man called Manish Surve from a van' 'parked outside a farmhouse.' 'The police have also stated that this is a suicide case.' 'Police have also found some love-letters' 'and photographs from Manish's home' 'which he wrote to Kaaya.' 'The police have also said' 'that these pictures and love-letters prove that' 'Manish Surve was a silent lover.' 'And his obsession was the motive behind Kaaya's murder.' Mr. Diwan, now that you've been acquitted, how do you feel? Do you know who was trying to set you up? All I know is that I had full faith in the judicial system. And I am happy that the truth is before the world. And everyone knows I am innocent. - Thank you. - Sir, sir.. one more question. - Sir. - Sir, please sir. Yes. Yes. Right now, all we can do is wait. The doctor's said that anything is possible. Sir, Mr. Singhania is not in his room. - What? - Welcome back, sir. - Thank you. - Good morning, sir. - Morning. Vaswani, was it so important to come here today? Bringing me to a place like this right after I got out of jail. Sir, this project was on hold for a long time. And we've invested lot of money in it. I thought why don't I take final approval from you - and start it again. - Okay. Sir, I'll get the blueprint. Within two weeks Aditya group of company's should have a clean image before the world. Yes, we can't afford to waste any more time now. Don't worry, we've already prepared a strategy. This is the only way to cover our losses. - We have all the reports.. - Sir, your lives are in danger. - We must leave immediately. - What's wrong? Saurav's here. We have to leave immediately. Let's go. Oh, Gosh! - What happened? - Run! Hurry up. Come on. I am sorry, Vikram. I am really sorry. This was entirely Aditya's plan, not mine. I let Aditya talk me into it. Please give me a chance to prove that I still love you. I was right. You were always cheap and you still are. Please believe me, Vikram. I'll give you anything you want. Whatever. I've realized Aditya can't belong to anyone. I am sorry. Really? Let's hear your offer. My offer is behind you! There's no difference between you and me. Whatever I did, it was for the money and now you're doing the same. There's a difference. Your built castles in the air and mine dream was firmly on the ground. I'd cry silently than I'd smile. I hated you! What's strange is that how did you survive after killing you twice? But I think God will fulfill my desire today. You kept praying to God for my death and I kept praying for yours. Now you'll know how it feels when your loved one cheats you and deserts you. You never tried to understand your elder brother. You could've just said it once and he would've happily given you everything. He would've given me everything? Then who are you? Who are you? I regret you'll never know this secret in this life. Saurav! Saurav! Saurav! Saurav! Saurav! Are you okay? Saurav! Saurav! Karan is conscious. He's going to live. 'The game has begun.' 'Saurav has entrapped Kaaya.' 'Kaaya is dead.' 'Vikram had a friend named Karan.' 'Vikram would spend time with him and play with him.' 'He had a problem with his liver.' 'Vikram didn't even hesitate' 'before deciding to donate half of his liver.' Karan my friend, so finally you took my advice. Yes, I thought I'd personally invite my best friend to my wedding. You're getting married. When? Soon. And you can meet Siya under that pretext. That's great news, man. Congratulations. And please congratulate Siya also for me. Definitely I will. Anyway, let's talk when we meet. - Okay, see you soon. - I'll see you at the airport. - I'll miss you. - I'll miss you, too. - 7. - Yes. - Yes, Yes. - Yes. 54.. Aditya! Siya.. I promise I'll take back everything they snatched from you. I promise. I promise! What if you had been harmed? I would've died. You gave me this life. You proved one thing. Blood ties are not the only relation. The real relation is of pain. It's easy to be called brother but difficult to be one. You're my real brother. You're my real brother. You're my real brother. "I'm obsessed to make you mine." "Since long." "Make me a bad habit" "is what I have to say to you." "I'm obsessed to make you mine." "Since long." "Don't stop me." "I am completely obsessed now." "That's how crazy I am." "Take a look at me." "I am suffering too." "I'm completely shattered to pieces." "There's no turning back now." "Whatever this is, it feels right." "Come." "I'm obsessed with becoming one with you." "Since long." "Let me stay close to you" "is what I have to say to you." "I'm obsessed to make you mine." "Since long." "I'm obsessed since long."
