I'm in the middle of casting some children. Pong. Aoy sent us a picture of her son. Jimmy is so adorable. Let's talk later. It's too noisy. I can hardly hear you. I'll see you at home, ok? I've got to work. Alright dear. I guess this means you're my boss Prae. It's not definate yet. Well, congratulations. Gotta run. Prae, Pookie wants to see you. OK. Let me stop by my office first. I'll catch you up. Alright. Prae! COLIC Hey...you're doing the washing late tonight. We're not ready for this yet. Prae, let's get married. Why don't you go in...I want to check our stuff. Prae, what are you carrying there? It looks heavy and you're pregnant. Let me help. Where's Pong? He's with the rest of our stuff. Just leave them here. Let the removal men take care of it. Over there is fine. That's it. Hello mom. Pong. Where are you. How could you let your wife carry such heavy things... ...while pregnant? Oh mom, it wasn't that heavy. Mine is much heavier. OK then, hurry up and put them down. Leave it there. Let the removal men take care of it. Is that a picture of your parents? Yes. You're very good. Growing up without any parents. They would be very proud. Stay with me and you won't be lonely. It won't be long before we have a little one running round here. Let me go check on something downstairs. Where are you going, mom? Just downstairs. OK, mom. Prae, don't you think we should turn this room into a nursery? Yes. That would be nice, it's so spacious. And it gets a nice breeze. Just give it a lick of paint. Benn! Benn, are you home? Benn. This is Prae. She'll be staying with us. Don't mind her, she hasn't been well. One day I'll tell you about it. What's that? The best cake ever! It looks great. It looks amazing. I wish you both a happy marriage. Thanks. Thanks so much. I wish you both much happiness. Thanks, mom. It's me. It's our wedding. Here, let me have the camera. Just look at these boys getting drunk down there. Yeah, yeah. Let them be. Let them go crazy for once. They're always getting drunk. Look at them. Go for it guys! Hey Jean, we're out of whisky. Can we get some more? Don't Prae. Don't spoil them. That's enough boys, it's late. Why are you still drinking? Give the newly weds some rest. Stop complaining. Get Pong up here so he can carry his bride off to bed. Hurry up. Prae, just go to bed. Don't bother to wait up for them. What's wrong, Pong? Nothing. See what you get? Have they left already? Well. it's 4am. Who would want to stay any longer. They have home to go to, you know. My head is killing me. Serves you right! Pong, can I ask you something? What? What happened to Benn? Benn, eh? Well, from what I remember, her husband was a soldier, and he died, but not like a car accident. He burned to death. That's strange. Where you close to her? And... Hey, are you asleep? I've resigned already. It was becoming difficult to work with my stomach like this. I was bored as well! So you feel like a failure? Why don't you make something and sell it here. You can help me with the illustrations for the books too? You can work from home until your baby is old enough. Then you can help me with my job. It'll give me time to get my masters. I can graduate in 2 years. OK, at least I won't be so bored. Bored? What's wrong? Tell me about it. Well, nothing really. I just think that the house is too far. With the traffic, Pong gets home so late. Sometimes at midnight or even 1am. You know his job has no fixed schedule. Stop worrying so much during your pregnancy, will you? Besides, you're married now. I don't know. I'm not sure if he's ready. It's like if I forced him into it. Pong is in the shower? Yes. He got home early today. The production wrapped up at 2:00 am, so he slept in today. Look at him. He's eating and sleeping at all the wrong times. You have to tell him. You look like you're at full term. When are you due? The date has been set for next week. Where are you off to? Have something to eat. I have an emergency at work. Go ahead and eat without me. It'll be another late night. I'll see you later, mom. Why are you in such a rush? You're missing dinner. I'll get it. Hello. May I speak to Pong. Who's calling? Ann. He's already left. So he's on his way? Thank you. Benn, do you want to join us for dinner? I brought this. Old newspapers. That's just what I need. Let me take them. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Affraid of what? Are you ok, Benn? Has Benn gone? What's her rush? Hello? Are'nt you asleep yet? I've just finished. I'm on my way home. Do you want anything? No. I'm ready for bed. Go to sleep then. You don't have to wait up. Ok. Who would wait up? Take me... Take me instead. Mom... Mom... What's wrong Prae? Benn's place is on fire. Quickly, call Benn. I'll call the fire brigade. Benn... Benn... Benn... Benn... Benn... Benn... Benn... Benn... Benn... Benn... Ok now. Take long, deep breaths. Breathe and push when you can. Long, deep breaths. Slowly. Long breaths. Your cervix is fully dilated and the baby is in position. Breath long and deep. He's on his way. Easy Prae. I can see his head. Looking good. Push... Push... Great! It's a baby boy. He's so strong and healthy. He has your nose, don't you think? No. I think it looks more like yours. But I think he has my mouth. Really? - I'll leave the birth certificate with you. - No Problem. Look at him. He's not interested in anything but his baby boy. I think so too. Wow, he was born at 11:59pm. One more minute and he would have been born on a different day, but he's a Thursday baby. Then... I'll go and take care of Benn's funeral arrangements. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I feel so sorry for Benn. She didn't have anyone except us, but why would she do that to herself? Sleep. Sleep little one. I think he'd be happier in his basket. You look awkward carrying him. You only close your eyes for me. Prae, turn the computer off? The pictures are done. Just pull the plug? No, it's ok. I'll take care of it. Go to sleep. What's the matter, little guy? There's no need to cry. Don't cry. Come on. Don't cry. Come on son, stop crying. Why are you crying so much, Pan? We cannot detect anything wrong with your son. He was born very healthy. But he was crying like he was in pain. He cried all the way here, doctor. Then we should check him more thoroughly. Your son appears to have colic. Colic? What is Colic? It's a medical condition, but you have nothing to worry about. It will last for about 3-6 months, then the child will grow out of it. It's what we use to call "The howling months". So what makes him cry like that, doctor? Is there anything wrong with him? Actually, nobody is really sure what causes this condition. Frankly speaking, the child is too young to tell us where it hurts, so we don't know where to check. But overall, the boy seems healthy to me. So you're telling us that all we can do is helplessly watch our son cry? There's absolutely nothing we can do? Pong. There has to be something. There must be. Pong. Doctor, my son cries all day and night and won't stop for anything, even when I'm carrying him. I don't know what to do. I feel like a bad mother. I feel so sorry for him and I don't want to see him like this, it gets stressed when he cries and now my husband and I are fighting all the time. That's right. We used to be so happy but after our son got this condition all we do is fight everyday. We don't understand what happened. Can you help us to get our old life back? Sorry. Pan... Don't cry. Don't cry my love. I'll get you some milk. Don't cry. Please stop crying. It's all done! I'm leaving now? My house isn't that close, you know. Alright! I'm leaving now. I have to go, Prae. Look at you. Working so hard. You must be so tired. Ohh, don't cry, my little angel. Don't cry. Granny's here. Don't cry. Are you hungry? I'll get you some milk. Where did that go? Oh come here my love. Come sleep in Grandma's room. Don't cry. Come sleep in Grandma's room. Don't cry. Come sleep in Grandma's room, so mommy can get some rest. Heven't you gone to bed yet, mom? I'm a little thirsty. Hard day? Yes. Have you eaten? You don't eat or sleep properly anymore. Don't let yourself slip like that. You're not a single man anymore. You're a father now not a work-horse. It's difficult mom. He's still the same. It's been more than 3 months and he hasn't stopped crying. Pong, I want to take him to see a monk, so he can be blessed with holy water. It might make him a little better. Mom, if holy water would help, I would bring some home and mix it with his formula. Stop being like that. Who knows if it will work. Doctors don't know what causes it. Shouldn't we try every avenue? Maybe he'll get better. He is your son! Alright mom. I'm free this Saturday. I'll take him. I haven't seen you here for a while. I had to come here, and I ask you to bless this child. He's been crying non stop. It's called "The hundred day cry". It has been more than 3 months, father. He won't stop. He won't stop? Let's have a closer look at him. Keep him close. Don't let him out of your sight until he's one year old. Remember not until he passes his first birthday. Prae... Prae... Prae... We should open that shop we were talking about. You wouldn't have to sit at home doing nothing all day. Come on, lets at least talk to him. Go on then. Excuse me. Hurry up! Excuse me. Enough with the measuring. Hey, careful! Excuse me. What? - Is your shop for lease? - Huh? Is this shop for lease? What was that? Hey, stop for a second. Do that later. Do something else for now. Are you interested? Excuse me. We can talk about the price if you're interested in the lease. Do you have a contact number? Oh, don't cry. Your Aunt Jean will be back in a second. In Chonburi and Rayong. We've got loads Well, they're too far. Not yet! Do something else for now. I'll kill you for sure. Umm... I don't know if you... Pan. Mommy's here, Pan. Jean's almost finished. Nearly done. Pan. Jean's nearly finished. What is it? Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't pull mommy's necklace. Don't... Let me call you back. I've had a bit of an accident. Six months old and he's much better. It's just like the doctor said. He doesn't cry anymore. Take him up to bed. It's getting late. I'll take him to his room. Why don't you give Prae a hand? Alright. Pong. If our son... Just leave them there. I'll take care of them. Why don't you go up to bed. You've been so busy. Oh, don't cry. Don't cry. What the hell is going on? It's been six months hasn't it? Let me take him. Oh, don't cry, sweetheart. Just give him a little more time. More time? How much longer? I think it's enough! Come on, son. What's the matter? You're as white as a ghost. Nothing. I didn't get enough sleep. I was afraid I wouldn't finish the project. What? I thought you said you were bored. Isn't Pan any better? What does his dad say about it? He's always busy! Thank god for my mom-in-law. How about this then? Don't worry about the project, just focus on Pan. No way! This is all I have. I'm not giving up. At least I can still care for myself. No one knows what the future holds. This has nothing to do with the project. I can handle the work. Alright, then take this project. It's not particulerly urgent. You can take your time. Parapsychology It's a science based on the 4th dimension, of the psychic realm and the 6th sense. I'm not too familiar with it. But I got my professor to write about it. This subject isn't that well known in Thailand but it's been studied in foreign universities for some time now. It's a bit like a science where people are born with the ability to see ghosts. Jean, do you remember what happened at the balloon shop? It was like my son knew what was going to happen. That's why he was crying so much. I'm not sure, but it's like every time my son cries, something strange happens. Sometimes I feel like there's someone else living in our house. Did you ever think that what we're doing might not be helping him? Maybe we are not focusing on the right cause? Maybe... So what should we be focusing on? We've done all we can. I don't know Pong. It's up to you if you want to believe me or not. I feel that there is something weird going on in our house. Every time our son cries, I feel that someone is hurting him. I've experienced things myself. Ghosts? You mean my father's ghost, right? My father must hate our son. That's why he picks on him. No, not like that. That's not what I meant. Then what are you trying to say? We both know our son's bizarre sickness can't be treated. It has nothing to do with my house. Pong. Do you want us to move? No, of course not. Then what? Don't we have enough chaos in our lives? Now you want to involve ghosts and demons? Have you gone mad? You've just realized that your wife is crazy? Do you even care about anything or anyone else? You can't even imagine what your son and I have to endure. You've never cared. All you do is work! Work! Work! What kind of a father are you? Alright then, I'll quit my job and catch the ghosts that are haunting you and Pan. To hell with trying to make a living. It might not only be my dad's ghost. Maybe the ghosts of your parents are having some fun too. Why must it be 3 to 6 months? There's no evidence of this in behavioural psychology. We believe that in the early stages of childhood, the spirit is in transition between past life and present life. The first cry... at the time of birth is believed to signifiy the presence of life on this earth. Um, what does it all mean, professor? Alright, in layman's terms. By the third month the optical nerves are fully developed. Children start to recognize their parents. This is the first form of communication with their new world. By month six, they'll start responding to voices that call out their names. They are becoming self aware. It's the time when they become developed enough to live in this world. Well, professor, can I be frank with you? Prae doesn't think her son is sick or disabled. She feels that there is some entity harming her child. Then we'll definately need more time to talk. What did the doctor say? He would like to monitor Pan for a bit longer. No! That's unacceptable. Well, just recover the damn data! I'm not sure if the tape we shot is still there. Look for it and I'll be there shortly. Yeah, later! You have to go again, son? Why don't you take the car? I'll take a taxi. Here are the keys. I think it's better if we take a taxi. See you later, son? Where the hell is everyone going? Look! Are we gonna make this light? Hurry it up, before it turns red again! I don't believe this. Take your time, we're in no hurry. Take my time, lady? Some of us have got to make a living. How is your work with Jean? It's going well. We're thinking about opening up a real shop. We might have to hire some help. Sounds great. But don't neglect those two boys of yours. I know married life can be hard but you need to support each other. This intersection takes forever. Don't they know how to switch it to green? These stupid kids are everywhere. I hope they get run over. Hurry the hell up. We're on green. Where did you learn to drive? What's taking so long? Ah, go blow your horn somewhere else. Whats your rush? Is it going to rain like this all night? Don't cry, sweetie. What the hell is it crying for? It's annoying me. I'm going deaf, lady. Pull over. Just stop right here. That's fine by me. We'll get another one. Just get out. You're so annoying. Don't you have anything smaller? I've got no change. Well, get some! From where? I only get a few customers per shift. Mom, do you have any change? In my purse, dear. Hold onto Pan. Jean called and told me what's been happening. I have a case that I'm overseeing here. When he was younger, he exhibited similar behaviour to your son. But in this case, he cried for years, then one day he simply stopped. He has a problem communicating with the outside world and so when he grew up, he began hurting himself. Oh no. You're wetting on you're aunt again. Give him here. I'll help. Don't worry. I'll take care of it. I can get changed at the same time. Thank you. The diapers are in the trunk. OK! Meet us later. OK. You know where to find us? Yes. This way, Prae. Pan, why did you do this to your aunt? Come in. Are you familiar with autism? This is a very severe case. This man is in his early twenties. Why is he like this? Nobody knows. There's been a lot of research done. Especially with him. He's out of touch with reality. I'm still studying him. It's as if there is something going on in his head in his mind, where we cannot go. There's something I want to show you. This way, please. That person you just saw in the wheelchair. This is a video that we took of him This is all he did. If we restrained him, he would hit his head. He would hit it against everything and would not stop. Finally he lost his sight. He became blind and broken. As you can see, we couldn't leave him unsupervised. Why did he do it? Nobody knows for sure. But one day, I turned the volume of my computer up. This is what I heard while he was hitting his head against the wall. He was alone when we recorded this. Some people may have things following them from birth. And no one has any idea how to help him? There are no guarantees but I believe that phsysical stimulation and dedication from the parents can help. Stay with him. Hold him. Stimulate his mind so he can communicate with the physical world. Pull him away from whatever is holding him back. Do whatever you can. I've already told you about the development of a child during his first year. They're out of control. Stop that. Stop that. Stop. Stop. Stop. Prae! Hello? Hello Pong? I'm with Prae at the hospital. Is she alright? She's fine. She fainted, that's all. I think she just needs some rest. They're giving her an IV. I'll drive her home when she wakes up. Thre's no need to worry. Please take care of her for me. Thanks. Have you had a shower yet? I can take care of Pan for a while, if you like. I think Prae will be asleep until morning. That's alright, I've got this. You're ready for anything. I'll go home then. I'm exhausted. Drive carefully. Pong. That stuff you two were fighting about. People don't know unless, they've experienced it first hand. I don't even believe it myself. But there must be some truth in it... Otherwise... You know Prae would never believe in it unless there was... Just listen to her. At least she'll have someone to talk to. I'm not buting any of this. You don't believe in anything do you? Pan! I remember what you told me about Pan's first year. Yes. But the crime he comminted in his past life was tremendous. He was born too soon, before he could repent his sins. What did he do? That's not important. When you are born with virtue, you'll live with virtue. When you are born with sin, you'll live with sin. All we can do now is keep him safe and protect him on this earth until it passes. Is there anything else we can do, Father? It's Karma. You can't repent someone else's sins. Listen to me. He's approaching his first birthday. I can give him a yearly blessing but the rest is up to you and your wife. Pong, what's wrong? Nothing. Go back to sleep. I'll check on our son. Get some rest. I might be a little late this evening. I'll try and finish as soon as possible. Don't worry about it. Pan seems to be behaving himself today. I can take care of him. - I'll come home soon. - Ok. Pong, we're ready. See you later. Quickly! Stay there. I'll be back soon. Are you ok? Are you ok? Help me get out of here. Hello. Can I speak to Pong, please? Don't cry my love. Don't cry. He'll be one years old at midnight. Don't worry Prae. I'll stay with him all nigh. Pong. Pong. He's asleep. Take him upstairs. I'll be right up as soon as I've cleaned up. Prae. Where's the flashlight? In the bathroom cabinet. - Are you ok? - Yes. Prae! Prae, are you alright? Prae! Prae, I can't open the door. I can't open the door! Prae! Prae! Prae, I can't open the door. Prae! Prae, I can't open the door! I'm right here, son. Open damn you! Pan! - Pan! - Pan! No!! Prae. Prae. Pong. Pong. How are you feeling Prae? You've had a fever all night. Pan... How is Pan? Pan is fine. Go back to sleep, Prae You're awake? How are you feeling? She's still quite hot. You need to get some rest. You are one brave girl! Thanks. Don't mention it. I'm free all day. I'll take care of Pan for you. Joan will stay at our place and look after Pan. I'll take Jean first and then I'll come back and stay with you. I'll be alright here. You go on home and get some rest. That's enough the pair of you. I'll take care of Pan. You two should talk. I'll be back later this evening. Take care of him for me. Don't you worry. I'll take good care of him just like you do. Get some sleep. Go to sleep. I won't be long! Jean, can I borrow your car? Where do you want to go? To visit my mom. I miss her. I'll drop you and Pan at home first then you can relax a bit. How is everything, Prae? Pong. Do you remember the day our son was born? What's wrong, Prae? I want to know the exact time he was born. I think it was a few minutes before midnight. Why did you ask? What's wrong? The first cry... at the time of birth, is believed to signify the presence of life on this earth. You took the video in the delivery room, didn't you? Please take a look at it and check when our baby first cried? The very first cry. Why, Prae? Trust me, Pong. Just check it! You're aunt is here. There... There... Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Let's get something to eat. I'll make you some rice soup. Prae, his first cry was after midnight. What? Wait for me here. Just one minute. Stay still. Stay still. Pan. Pan! Pan, mommy is coming! Jean! Jean! Pan! Don't be scared my love. Mommy's here. Jean! I'm here, son. Jean! Pong. Pong, I'm here. I can't open the door. Help me, Pong! Prae! I'm here, Pan. Pong, help me. Pong, help! Pong! Pong! Pan, stay there. Don't move! Stay there! Pong! Help! Stay away my love. Don't come any closer. Stay still! Don't move! Don't move! Go back! Go back! Don't move! Go back! Go back! No!!! Prae? - Pong, help our son. - Pan... Prae. Where are the tongs? I think they're in the store room. Pan. Pan. Can you get daddy the tongs? My mouth's full. What's in your hands? Let mommy see that. 5 Students Hanged And Burned To Death Slaughtered During Protest 5 Students Hanged And Burned To Death What Benn left behind showed us the atrocities which our son commited in his past life. Benn's husband was reborn in our son. Even though it's all in the past, we thought it would be a good idea that he come here and ask for forgiveness himself. Give that to mommy.
