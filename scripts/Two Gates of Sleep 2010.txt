When shall I come to thee? When shall my sorrows have an end? Thy joys when shall I see? Hm, I remember those. Let's go home now. What happened? Nothing. Mama? Perfect, round. I can see it now. No eyes... No feet... Nothing exists outside seeing. No organs... No breath, only eating... There are no places anymore. See, what did you say? Well, I will leave with them. There is no leaving. I feel it through me. I know you know. I can see it... No, no, not alone, together. When it moves, I will move. When it sleeps, I will sleep. You find her like that? We gotta get an ambulance out here. Pick her up. Never gonna happen, doc. Lewis, it ain't up to me. It's the law. You ain't the law. I don't see any law here. I gotta report to the county. Her death certificates have to be filled out. She's gotta be taken to the morgue. Sheriff's gotta come out here and ask some questions. Deer or coon, out in the forest, you gotta call to fill out papers? You know what they're gonna do to her. I'll see it on tv. Gotta bunch of creepers... filling her up with tubes and fluid. No, sir. That ain't what she wanted. I know that much. I can't help it, son. That's just the way it's done. They gotta do it properly. You know how much that gonna cost? Well, I'm sure we can get the county to help out. I don't want their help. We're gonna do what she wanted. I don't think you understand. I don't understand what? I called you, out of courtesy. I'm sorry for your loss. If you ain't gonna do it right, don't do it. Gotta set your nails straight before you drive it. Who says your way's right? There's a right way. There's a wrong way. You ain't doing it right. Shit. Gonna have to walk. Ah, geez. Shit. It's sinking. Hold on. Lift it up! Push! Get it up! Get it up! Put it down! Lewis. Lewis! Lewis!
