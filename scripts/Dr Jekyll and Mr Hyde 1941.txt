So it is, on this glorious Sabbath morning... ...in this momentous year of 1887... ...we naturally turn our thoughts towards that way of life... ...as exemplified by Victoria, our beloved queen. For this week begins Her Majesty's golden jubilee. From her heart has come an ever-increasing flow... ...of virtue and moral blessing. She came upon a world sadly mired in the ways of the flesh. But during her reign, the forces of good have achieved notable... Stop. Stop. What's wrong, dear? Nor the season... ...we know that in God's own time evil shall be wiped out by good. Evil wiped out, eh? You wanna take all the fun out of life? Good old Beelzebub, the boy with the horn! - Has taken root in a new goodness, during these decades. At the family hearth, in the shops of industry that... That the world moves forward today. Blasphemy, I calls it... ...to talk that way about a man's best friend. Blasphemy! - Did Parker go for a constable? - Yes. - Hello. - Hello, governor. You let me go back in there... ...and I'll tell them what a grown man really thinks about. - He been like this before? - It's gotten worse since the explosion. - Shock? I see. - You're a full-blooded young fella. - You'll tell them. - I thought if... We know, don't we? What's going on in here? - Drunk and disorderly. - Now, wait a minute, constable. Take him to Camden Hospital. Would you give that to Dr. Heath? Better take him to the station. He's always... Oh, Dr. Jekyll. Bats, is he? Right, sir. Camden Hospital it is, Dr. Jekyll. - All right, me lovely. Upsy-daisy. - Dr. Jekyll, eh? You go on, Dr. Jekyll, and try to put old Beelzebub in his bottomless pit. He'll show you! Go back and be good, Dr. Jekyll! - I must go to the hospital, sir. - On a Sunday? You mean that outrageous individual. Harry says that Providence dropped the man right into his lap. - But isn't this most unusual, my boy? - I'm sorry, but it is, sir, most unusual. Don't you dare be late for the Marley dinner tonight. And let you have a free rein with all those men? I should say not. - That's a silly little hat you've got on. - I knew you'd like it. There isn't anything about you I like. All right, Jenkins. I'm sorry. - My dear, please. - Sorry, Father. Beatrix, I'm a very broad-minded man but I do wish Harry... ...wouldn't make such demonstrations of affection in public... ...even if you are going to marry him. - Now, Father darling, don't be pompous. Good heavens, nibbling your knuckles. I'll tell them what a grown man really thinks about. I can't allow it. It's a matter of ethics, Jekyll. - Please, Dr. Jekyll, may I go in? - No, not now, Mrs. Higgins. Bear up. That's how you can help. It's the greatest opportunity I've ever had. The more I see it, the more I realize it. My dear Jekyll, you know how we all admire your work... ...and this case does come within the scope of your research. That's why I'd like to bow to your opinion. But as head of the staff at this hospital, I cannot... Listen, Jekyll, tell me straight out: What could you do for this man? I might have a chance of curing him. I've been experimenting with animals. But what works with animals may not with a human being. - Your chemicals may be deadly. - Not one animal has died. It might. It's too dangerous, too far outside of known medicine. - But I'm no witch doctor. - Who's called you a witch doctor? You told me yourself it still had to be proved. I can't allow you to experiment with... Why, after all... ...the man's a human being! - You mean he was a human being... ...and he may be again, if you'd keep ethics out of this! Sometimes we have to gamble. Or haven't you the courage to face the most daring... Jekyll, I wouldn't talk these experiments around very openly if I were you. You're dealing with things it would be better not to mention. - There might be trouble. - Trouble? Trouble! Harry, old boy, there are rumors of... What's the matter? - Don't worry, John, I'm leaving. - Now, it can't be as bad as that. John, my good friend, I realize your Dr. Heath is right. After all, we doctors can't experiment on human beings. Something might go wrong, and they'd no longer believe in our medicine. - Now, look here... - But when I get proof, ethics or no... I wanna be on hand, regardless. Good afternoon, sir. Just in time for tea, sir. I'll be bound you had no lunch, sir. Now, what about some nice hot crumpets, sir, huh? Of course, we mustn't spoil our appetite for dinner tonight. Miss Beatrix would be after me properly if we did that, sir. And besides, Mrs. Marley's butler tells me... ...that their new cook is really first-class, sir. Sir, what about your tea, sir? Shall I serve it down there, sir? Now, look here, sir, you must have something, you know. Mrs. Marley, my deepest apologies. You doctors. I know we can never rely on you. You know, I don't mind being scolded by the smartest hostess in London. - Dr. Jekyll, do sit over there. - Thank you. Good evening. Giles. Colonel. My special apologies to you, Lady Colburn. Pleasurer. - Behaving yourself? - No. - A doctor's life, huh, Harry? - The more patients, the colder the soup. Actually, I got started on something and lost track of time. Oh, yes, Jekyll. Heath was telling me that you're still carrying on with that research work. Dr. Heath isn't in sympathy, Dr. Courtland. That's understandable, isn't it? After all, separating the facets of the brain. Rather ambitious, I should call that. His research goes deeper than the brain... ...into something more intangible than the mind. Then all that seems to be left is the soul. All right, then, call it the soul. The soul? Come, come, my dear doctor. Now you're invading my territory. I suppose I am, but I know that you wouldn't object... ...if science could be of help to the church. The church is always grateful for any help, doctor. Harry doesn't mean a word of this. I'm afraid he's pulling our leg. I should hope so. I was wondering what Jekyll would do... ...if I asked him to elaborate. - I don't mind elaborating. If you didn't see that poor chap in church this morning... ...you heard him, I'm sure. Thank you for your assistance. - Hopelessly insane, obviously. - I don't think he was insane. I think there was only one side of him expressing itself. - Good heavens, which side? - His evil side. The man was spiritually distorted through shock. That explosion in the gas main last month. Before that, he was a fine, solid citizen... ...kind with his children, deeply in love with his wife. Since then, he had undergone a complete change... ...until this afternoon I found him completely reverted to the animal. We can clearly understand a shock to the nervous system... ...but how does that affect the soul? I think he was shocked from normal good into complete evil. When I say he was a good man... ...I don't mean he hadn't had a bad thought. Or that he hadn't committed ordinary transgressions against society. But, after all, that's the problem of civilized man's soul, isn't it? That good and evil are constantly fighting one another? There's a higher source from which good can find aid in its fight. I realize that, but... The colonel and I have always felt that a person can be good if they wish to be. - And, well, otherwise if they don't. - Jekyll, I simply must get this straight. Well, let me put it this way: Good and evil are so close as to be chained together in the soul. Suppose we could break that chain, separate those two selves... ...free the good in man, and let it go to its higher destiny and segregate the bad. But aren't you a bit presumptuous in assuming that there's evil in all men? But isn't that true? Wouldn't we be hypocrites if we didn't admit that? We've all had thoughts that we didn't want published or shouted out loud. And we certainly have had desires that are not confined to a drawing room. Why, as Christians, we admit that man is created weak. That's a perfectly honest problem. Why don't we face it? Suppose we believe that man's soul has not yet reached its fulfillment. Is it wise...? Is it right to tamper with the problem... ...until the Creator himself has solved it in his own mysterious way? - Sir, I... - Really, this is very disturbing. Such theories come dangerously close to... I hesitate to think what the medical council would say... Dr. Courtland, advanced theories are always a sore point... ...with the medical council. Or even with the queen's physician, if there's a comfortable profit... ...in those already established. - Jekyll! If you ask my opinion, young man, this is pure balderdash. - Ladies. - I meant to ask: Has anyone read that poem by this new chap Oscar Wilde? - Getting old, I suppose. - Well, it's pretty late. - We ought to... - No. Come in and have a nightcap, John. The rest of the company won't be bored. Well, thank you, sir. Look. It's the waltz that he and Mama first danced together. May I have this dance, Miss Beatrix? Pleasure, Dr. Jekyll. - Bea, darling. - Harry. I love you so very much, Bea. Oh, Harry. Tonight at dinner, I understood what you said about the good and evil in people... ...and how it's that way in all of us. But... Well, why isn't...? Why isn't the way you and I feel about each other? I mean, there's nothing evil in that, is there? - Do you think there is? - No. No, Harry. - Bea, we're in love, aren't we? - Yes, we're very much in love. That's all the difference. Oh, my dear, John is looking for a piece of music... ... The Banks of Loch Lomond, will you help him find it? - Yes, Father. - Thank you. Harry... I'm not one to brood, but you must have noticed my concern in the carriage. I just thought that... That flight of fancy you put forth at dinner, I must confess, it startled me. Although I'm broad-minded myself, it was a bit shocking too. I'm sorry to hear you say that, sir, because it was not a flight of fancy. - You mean, you were in earnest? - Profoundly, sir. As a matter of fact... ...I hope to spend all of my time... - This is distressing. Why? In my opinion, the whole thing's harebrained. Well, I'm sorry to hear you say that, sir. L... You're a coming man in your profession. I'm very proud of you. But these ridiculous experiments won't get you anywhere. You must give them up. Develop your practice... ...cultivate the circle in which you and Beatrix shall move. Harry, my boy, I've always wanted a son, and now you're going to be that. Now, I've had my say. Let's have your nightcap. It's getting late. And by the way, I've taken a box for the opening concert at Albert Hall. You'll join us, of course. - So you and the old boy cross swords? - Yes. Seems I must discontinue my research, spend my life diagnosing measles... ...mumps, and whooping cough or encounter his serious disapproval. Even I was surprised when you took a Marley dinner party into your confidence. You need not agree with me, I just have a decision to make. Harry, you and I have been friends for years. I can't agree with you, but that doesn't make a difference to our friendship. Let's drop into the club. It'll do you good. Well, I'll walk that far with you. Let me go! You thug! Let me go! Help me! Help me! Let him go. Let him go. - You get a cab. I'll see what's happened. - Yes. A girl can't walk out with a chap. Who does he think he is? - The big... - Did he hurt you? Lt'll take more than a bloke like that to... Why, I bet I look ever so untidy. You sure you're not hurt? Why, I... I don't think so. - What is it? Your ankle? - Yeah. It's twisted. Do you mind? No, not at all. - After all, an ankle can be very painful. - You are ever so kind. Me side too. He hit me. Well, I should have caught him. No, no. I'm... I mean, I'm so glad you stopped. If you take my meaning. My friend is getting a cab. Perhaps we could drop you somewhere. - You're ever so kind. - Shall we try it now? There. That's a girl. Gentlemen like you shouldn't be bothering yourself about me. Now, what sort of a gentleman doesn't like to help a pretty girl? Now. And me with me hat all over me head. So he asks me if he can walk me home, he does. Well, I turns around to him, and I says, "Yes. " When a girl is out late, it's nice to have a bit of company to see her home. Naturally. Well, I know what's what. You have to if you are a barmaid. I like a bit of fun, as the saying goes... ...but when a bloke grabs you with nasty notions in his head... ...it's time to put your foot down. I'm... I'm sorry to bother you gentlemen. Well, here we are. - It hurts more now. - Does it? - Can I give a hand, Harry? - No, I think I can manage. I'm so sorry. - Night. - Night. Here? The light's by the door, if you have a match. Right. You better let down your blouse. Why? Well, you want me to have a look at you, don't you? I don't know. You are looking, ain't you? Well, how about your side? Do you want to look at my side? Well, don't you want me to? You aren't half a fast one, aren't you? I forgot to mention, my friend and I are physicians. Physi... Physicians? Doctors. Doctors? Oh, go on! I thought you were a couple of toffs. No, no. Haven't the leisure. Oh, dear me. And here I thought... - I'm glad to see you're not really hurt. - But I am, doctor. - Really. - Maybe I better send you to the hospital? No. Look. Here. Feel. - Feel. - Where? Here? Just as I thought: Cirrhosis pectoris. What's that mean? That means your eyes are twin pools of desire. Oh, doctor. That's nice. The things you do say. That doesn't hurt anymore, huh? Oh, yes. - Yes. Yes. - You'll be all right in the morning. Wait! Wait. My ankle. Don't you think you ought to look at that? No. No, your ankle's all right. But I'll tell you one thing. You wear your garter too tight. - That stops the circulation. That's bad. - There, you see? You did find something. You are my doctor, aren't you? I ought to pay your fee, oughtn't I? I haven't presented you with a bill yet. How about this to begin with? Not that it's enough. It's fine. It's fine. It's much more than most people pay. It doesn't seem near enough to me. Harry, listen... Oh, sorry. Come along, will you? It's getting late. Well... But... But you aren't really going just because he says? No, no, no. But I have to go now. But look here. Don't you understand? I ain't no... I ain't no... No, I know you're not. You're a girl with her heart... ...just where it ought to be. Maybe a little too generous. Because you're a nice, pretty girl, next time be more careful... ...about the company you pick, huh? Well, but... But you are here, ain't you? Yes, but I shouldn't be. And if you really knew me, you'd know I don't wanna be. Well, I... I picks only them as wants my company. - I'm sorry. It was my fault. - What you sorry about? I am not. Then let's just say that we were foolish... ...and next time we'll drink to one another's health. I suppose it was all in fun when you kissed me. Yes. It wasn't all in fun then. I know that. Well, goodbye and good luck. Come on, John. Don't be stuffy. After all, the lady wasn't injured, nor was anyone else. I imagine she might be a tempting morsel in an off moment. - What do you mean, "off moment"? - Yours, according to your theory. I imagine what I just witnessed... ...was the momentary triumph of the evil in your soul over the good, huh? Correct? Yes, yes. I don't think it was a triumph, but it was an attack. But one which would have been repulsed even without your help, John. Wouldn't you run less risk if you confined your experiments to the lab? That's where you'll find me from tonight on... ...until I get what I'm looking for. I'm worried, John. - He ought to have let us know. - He'll be along. Maybe it's all for the best, Dr. Jekyll. That wasn't my son in there. It was as if the evil one had crept into his heart. My poor Sam. - Burke, take Mrs. Higgins home. - Yes, sir. - I'll walk. - Oh, thank you, Dr. Jekyll. - Thank you. - Good night, Mrs. Higgins. Good night, doctor. Good night. - Hello, Dr. Jekyll. How are you? - Good evening, Mr. Weller. Just in time, sir. Just locking up. Wait half a moment until I fix this thing over here... ...I'll walk up to the east gate with you. Wonderful nights we're having, sir. And don't you believe about this here comet... ...and the "world coming to an end" business. If you ask me, it don't amount to a row of beans. Newspaper talk, that's what I calls it. Don't you believe it. Step down to Lloyd's and take out an insurance policy and it won't cost you... ...more than it did last week when there was no talk of a comet... ...or the world running into one. Those fellows know what they're talking about, sir. You take that from me. Mr. Weller, here's a point. If you had a balloon that carried a man to Mars and the pilot you picked... ...suddenly disappeared, would you get in the balloon yourself and cast off? A balloon? Well, that's a good one, sir. I think you got me there. I don't know though. If I had a balloon that would take me there... ...and back, mind you, I don't know that I wouldn't have a go at it. Might get me away from me mother-in-law for a while. How's that for an answer, Dr. Jekyll? Fair enough, Mr. Weller. Fair enough. Yes? What? Oh. Oh, no. Can this be evil? Dr. Jekyll. Dr. Jekyll? - What's happening, sir? Are you all right? - What is it? What do you want? Is that you, Dr. Jekyll? Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute, Poole. Dr. Jekyll, who is that in there? Dr. Jekyll, answer me, sir. Yes, Poole? I'm sorry, sir, but I... I heard an odd noise and a strange voice. I thought something was happening, sir. No, no, no. It's quite all right, Poole. There was someone here. A friend of mine. A Mr. Hyde. I let him out the back door. Oh, I see, sir. Very good, sir. Miss Beatrix is here, sir. I showed her into the consulting room, sir. I hope I did right, sir. Yes, yes, that was quite right, Poole. Tell Miss Beatrix I'll be there immediately. Very good, sir. Harry. What are you doing here, Bea? - Oh, Harry, then you're not... - Not what? Oh, I don't know. I had the strangest feeling. - I thought... - Yes? You thought? That you were going away... ...without ever seeing me again. Well, why would I do that, Bea? - I love you. Why... - Oh, I know. But I lost you for a moment, Harry. - I was afraid. - But you're not afraid now? Of course not. Well, you see that everything's all right... ...nothing has happened, that I'm the same as I ever was? Of course. - It must have been a dream. - Yes, yes, a dream. You're not angry with me? Angry? Oh, I don't want you to leave me. Ever. Oh, darling. I love you so much. - Please don't send me away. - No. Yes, Father? It's a good thing I was worried about your behavior tonight. I couldn't sleep myself. Sir Charles, I know it's strange to find Beatrix here but I want you to believe... All I can believe is that your ideas are not normal, Jekyll, not fit... Sir Charles, I asked Beatrix to come here tonight because... No, Harry. Father, I know my being here is difficult to understand, but I'm not ashamed. Then, my dear, I shall be for you, because I do understand. We leave for the Continent tomorrow on the boat train. Father, please. Oh, come, Sir Charles. After all, you could eliminate all this difficulty... ...if you'd set an early date for our marriage. You don't understand. We're very much in love. We wanna be together. - We don't wanna wait any longer. - Please, Father. In view of what's happened, the engagement should be broken off. However, I'll be lenient. We shall see you on our return. Come, my dear. Father, I've never disobeyed you in my life. But, Harry, if you don't want me to leave... ...I'll refuse. - Beatrix. - I mean it, Father. I don't want you to go, Bea... ...and I can't agree with your father's decision, but I know... ...he's thinking of your happiness. I can't argue against that... ...and I can't ask you to. - That's highly commendable, Harry. Will you see us off at the train? Better have two engines. I might try to hold it back. Try. Try anyway. A glass of sherry wine, sir? No. No, thanks. Well, would you consider a letter from Monte Carlo, sir? - I'll take the sherry wine too. - Yes, sir. Miss Beatrix should be returning home soon now, shouldn't she? Yes. Yes, Poole. Hobson was telling me that they were expected. Bad news, sir? Miss Beatrix and her father are going to Aix-les-Bains. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Sir Charles' health, no doubt? Yes, yes. Yes, Sir Charles' health, no doubt. If you'll forgive me, sir, it upsets me to see you like this. It isn't right. All work, as the saying goes, sir. They say there's a very interesting musical show at the Vanity Fair, sir. Very comical, you know, sir. And very daring, if you follow my meaning, sir. Yeah, I follow your meaning, Poole. But I don't think it would be wise, even though it is comical. Quite so, sir. - I'll fetch you another glass, sir. - Oh, never mind, Poole. Thanks for the pay, sir. Hey, hey, hey! Here. What's the idea, governor? Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. Yes, sir? Box F, sir. Right this way. Now, all together, boys. Two pints. Oh, oh. A tip. A tip, of course. Seven shillings, sir? Why... - Why not? You work hard, don't you? - Yes, sir. Bless you, sir. - You have a family, no doubt. - Yes. Yes, sir. Thank you. - Did you hurt yourself? - What the...? Oh, what a pity. You were thinking of the children, no doubt? Now, have that barmaid bring me some champagne. - Ivy ain't allowed to leave the bar. - I don't think you understood me. - What's all this here? - This gent here wants champagne, sir. Champagne? All right, then, bring it, bring it. - But he wants Ivy to serve it. - Of course Ivy will serve it. Go on. Look lively. A gent in box F wants you to serve him, and Old Prouty says you're to do it. Oh, he does? I'll tell him it ain't my business. But he wants a bottle of the boil. Oh, bubbly. Why didn't you say so? Hey, Ivy, me love, how about some fish and chips after the show? How about a dozen oysters and a pint of stout? What about a glass of champagne? - Oh, hello, Marcia. - Hello, Ivy. Watch out, Ivy. How's about it, Ivy? Over there, Ivy. Ain't she a bit of horseflesh? Well, that'll... That'll be half a quid, sir. Half a quid? Yes, sir. Half a quid. Here. Here's a sovereign, my dear. Keep the change. Thank you, sir. Oh, but you're not going? Oh, no. No. After all, you brought two glasses. Two minds with but a single thought. My, what a nice beginning. Sit down there. Sit right down. Well, I... Well, I'll just take a sip. - Of course, I shouldn't stay too long. - Oh, nonsense. Nonsense. You can stay as long as you like. After all, we have all evening, haven't we? Of course we have. Here. There. Oh, I like your singing. Yes. You must sing again for me sometime. Where did you get such a pretty voice? Well, I don't know. I just... Perhaps it's the pretty place it comes from? - Well... - Very lovely, where it comes from. - Well, here's health so good luck. - I make my own luck, my dear. Yes, and tonight I follow the rainbow. Oh, you don't half talk, do you? Perhaps we could follow it together? - I'll follow it right home, mister. - To that rattrap? - Hey, what are you calling names? - I think you deserve something better. How do you know where I live? Well, I can imagine. Surely your wages here don't earn you a place in Barkley Square. Well, I think I'll be off. Why? I don't confuse you, do I, Ivy? I believe I do confuse you, don't I? I ain't confused by nobody. Let go. Do you hear? Let go. Let go, you hear? - What's he doing, Ivy? - Oh, you let go too! Watch out, Ivy love. - Here, here. What's this all about? - It's him. He insulted her. - He's lying, I tell you! - He tried to break her arm. - He did, did he? - Yes, yes. Tried to break her arm. You will? You want another one? No! No! Stop it! Stop it! I'll stop it, sir. Hey, boys! Now, boys! Boys, will you...? I can't understand what happened. Never a rumpus here. Most orderly. It's that girl, Ivy, that barmaid. Pretty girls always cause trouble. - I'd throw her out if I were you. - What? Lvy? I can't do that to Ivy. A great man can always change his mind... ...for a reason. Yes, sir. Why, certainly, sir. Yes, sir. A troublemaker, that's what she is. Out she goes. Yes, but now, while the evening is still young. - Yes, sir. Certainly, sir. - Yes, certainly. What happened? I've done nothing. Just minding my own business. - That's my decision, my girl. - Stop pushing! - Don't hang about here. - Who's hanging about? - Go on. Don't argue the point. - Oh, good riddance. What's happened in there? - Is there some trouble, Ivy? - Trouble? I was sacked, that's what! How fortunate I'm here. I'd like to help you. Let me back in there so I can bash him on the nose, that's all! Quite the little Tartar, aren't you? Always ready to flare up. Oh, I like that. Here, here. This is just to prove that I want to help you. The rainbow is wide and long, Ivy. - Oh, now wait. I better get home. - No, no, no. Ivy, my darling, you belong with the immortals. Come with me to Mount Olympus. Drink nectar with the gods. Sing the ancient songs of pleasure. And put Athena and Diana to shame. Oh, you aren't half of one with the words, aren't you? And don't be frightened of me, will you, Ivy? When a botanist finds a rare flower, he shouts his triumph, doesn't he? Are you one of them? You like a man who sees a girl and makes up his mind, don't you? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, she doesn't know what I'm talking about. - Please, sir. - But you'll find out, won't you? - Please. - You'll find out what it means. Please, sir. The London Post, Sir Charles. Oh, thank you. And one for you, mademoiselle. What does Harry have to say this morning, my dear? I said, what does Harry say this morning? Oh, nothing much. I'll wager my gout hurts him more than it does me. Does he send any news I can hear? Oh, he just says that he walked through the East End recently. "I have never seen such deplorable housing conditions. Surely the city fathers should find the funds to... " Well, then he just goes on to say about the housing conditions. They must be pretty dreadful. He's quite right. They're disgraceful. I was saying at the club before I left. Now, there's a problem Harry could get his teeth into. He's just the man to... Here, here, my dear. What's wrong? Nothing. I suppose I'm just not very interested... ...in housing conditions at the moment. You mean because a man doesn't cover the pages with sentiment? Nonsense. A woman must learn to read between the lines, my dear. Yes, I like the tone of that letter. And what's more, my dear, I think my gout is getting very much better. - Oh, hello, Marcia. - Are you here alone? Yes, yes. I just made some tea. Come and have a cup. Not me, nor you either. We ain't got time. Get dressed, we're going out. Freddie's got a brother from Oxford. They want another girl to make it a quartet. He's a bit of all right too. And we're going to the Empire. - The Empire? - Yes. Oh, it's ever so gay there, Ivy... ...and the show is grand. It's just where all the toffs go. - No, I don't think so, Marcia. - Why not? I just don't feel like it. That's all. You ain't afraid to go, are you? Afraid? - Why should I be afraid? - Oh, I don't know. I just thought... Well, I ain't afraid of nobody. But you ain't been out for ever so long, have you? - No, but... - He ain't your lord and master, is he? I should say he ain't. Or is it because you ain't got a nice enough dress? Of course I have. What are you standing there for, then? Go and put it on. All right. What's that across your back? What? There's nothing. Did he do that to you? - Let me see. - No. No. It ain't nothing. - I just... - So that's your fine friend, is it? The dirty, filthy brute! If ever a man dared lay a hand to me like that, I'd... Well... Aren't you going to introduce me to our charming visitor? It's Marcia. This is my friend, Mr. Hyde. You've heard me speak about him, haven't you? Oh, yes, Marcia. I've heard a great deal about you. I've never been interested. Until now. I've got to be toddling along now. - Toodle-loo, Ivy. - Oh, no, no. Don't go now, Marcia. After all, this could be very interesting, the three of us in friendly discussion. I can't keep my friend waiting. - I'll be dropping by, Ivy. - Yes, yes, yes. Drop by sometime when I'm here, Marcia. Your ideas differ from mine. It would be a charming experience to change them. Ivy found it that way. Didn't we, dear? Nice material. Goodbye. Very nice material. Marcia's a very pretty girl, isn't she? Oui. Yes, sir. That's what frightens you, isn't it? Why... ...no, sir, I... You're afraid I'll become interested in Marcia. Why... ...well, if you... If you want to... What?! What?! You're not very clear. Well, sir, I... Oh. Oh, you poor child. I'm such a tease, aren't I? Such a tease. Yes, sir. What a lucky man I am to be loved this way. But supposing I did have to leave you for a while? Leave, sir? When? I'm not saying when, I said "suppose. " Well... Supposing I had to take a trip from time to time? You... You mean... soon? Well, now, I don't know. Oh, you mustn't look so worried. It won't be for a long, long time. Oh, I see. So we won't think about it now, will we? No, sir. When I do go, it will break your heart, won't it? Yes, sir. Well... What would my little cherub like to do this evening? Oh, sir, could we go out? Out? You mean gad about a bit, see the sights? Yes, sir. Oh, you'd like it, wouldn't you, sir? Well, now, I don't know. I don't know. That might be very charming. Where would we go? Oh, they say that the Empire and such places... They do? Who does? Well, Marcia, sir. She says it's ever so gay. - Oh, really? - Yes. We can go, can't we? They say that the bill is ever so good. And I haven't been out for so long. No. No, that's right. You haven't, have you? You do look a little pale. Yes. Yes, that's true. Not that I am complaining, you understand... Oh, no. Oh, no, no. I understand. You're just nervous and jumpy, that's all. - Yes, sir. - Yes, yes. You have that cooped-up feeling. Yes. You do understand, don't you? - Yes, yes. - Well, then... Well, now, where would we go? We might go to Albert Hall. Yes. And hear a symphony. Albert Hall, sir? Well, I sort of hoped that... What makes you say...? So you'd like to go out, huh? Yes, sir. I'll go and put my things on. Don't hurry. Because we're not going. Sir? The bill is ever so good right here. Now, let's see, what shall we do? We could play cards. But you're probably tired of cards, aren't you? You might read to me. Yes. Yes. Milton's Paradise Lost would be nice. But we haven't the book, have we? And I don't suppose you know it from memory, do you? I know. I know what we like. You must sing for me. No. Oh, no, not that. - Why not? - Not that. Not in good voice? - It isn't that, sir, but... - But it's such a pretty song. - Please, not tonight. - Yes. Sing it gaily. - I can't! Truly, I can't! - Sing it with deep compassion then. Or loving kindness even. - Sing it moodily, sing it with... - I can't! You hear me? Sing it! Sing it! Smile when you sing! Be happy! Be gay! That's it! That's it! That's it! That's it! That's it! Bravo! A prima donna is born! Let's shower her with orchids! The world is yours, my darling. The moment is mine. And I says to the wife, I says: "Look here, my girl, if you think the world is... " Good morning, sir. How about a nice hot cup of tea, sir? No. No, thanks, Poole. Would you consider a telegram from foreign parts, sir? And a nice cup of tea as well, sir, huh? I know it's good news. Hobson told me last night that they were expected home today, sir. This is a great day for us, if you'll forgive me saying so. Soon be back to our regular meals, regular hours, regular ways, sir. - Your breakfast will be ready soon, sir. - Poole. Put on your hat and coat and take an envelope to the messenger office... ...to be delivered by hand. - Very good, sir. Ivy. Ivy, dear, it's me. - Oh, Marcia. Hello. - Hello, Ivy. I didn't hear you. Hello, Fred. Hello, Ivy. Get yourself a drink, Fred. - I'll make some tea. - We don't want anything. Yes, but... Don't bother about us, Ivy, dear. - Oh, Marcia! - Oh. For Miss Ivy Peterson. Thanks, governor. Look. Fifty pounds. There ain't no letter. You don't suppose it's from him? He must have sent it for what he's done. No, not him. He's too mean, he is. Oh, I don't know. I wouldn't put it past him. Yes. Yes, that's it. Hopes I'll use it to try and run away. Oh, I can see him thinking it up, I can. And then, then he'll follow me. And just when I think that I've got free, he'll... I can't stand it anymore. I can't stand it. Oh, if I could only do it... ...I'd go down to the river. Oh, Ivy. It's her nerves, that's what. She ought to see a doctor. There's a copy of the Winged Victory. The real one's in the Louvre in Paris. I know because I saw it there. What's the sense of being victorious if you haven't a head? What's the sense of my taking a trip, acquiring art and culture... ...if you're not going to pay attention? You're back here. That's the only victory that counts. That's why I was deluged with all those letters. - Bea, now look... - Oh, I know. But if I ever go away again and you don't write just because you're ill... Oh, don't you see how much more worried that would make me? It all amounts to this. February is a long way away, and your father will simply have to listen... If you don't stop looking at me like that, I won't be responsible for what happens. - Aren't public places awful sometimes? - Awful. - May I interrupt this loud conversation? - Oh, here you are. Sir Charles, glad to see you. Sorry you weren't in. You look fine. It's nice to be back. You're looking well yourself. Sorry to be late, my dear. In an argument at the club. What's on the program? I thought we'd go to Stewart's, if that's agreeable. Excellent! But, while it's on my mind, Harry... ...there's something we must straighten out. I've gone through enough with Beatrix over this. I may be getting old and crotchety, but I won't put up with it anymore. I'm afraid you must take her off my hands as soon as possible. Oh, Father! Well, Sir Charles, that's... Of course, I insist on all the trimmings: Wedding at St. Margaret's, Bishop Manners, reception. Yes, sir, Sir Charles. I'd... Well, show her you're happy about it. Do something, man. Just another work of art, madam. It's not in your catalog. We're feeling rather gay, are we, sir? Poole, old friend, I'm going to be married very soon. Sir, you don't know how happy that makes me. I knew it would, Poole. Thank you. Sir, there's a patient in the consulting room, a Miss Ivy Peterson. She's without an appointment. If you've no time, I can... No, no, that's all right. I'll see her. So it's you, sir. So you are the famous Dr. Jekyll. Well... I'm the one you and your friend took home that night. - Remember? - Well, what... ...what brings you here, Miss Peterson? - I think... - Are you ill? There. That's what. Look at that. Pretty, ain't it? Did you ever see a thing like that before? I'll get you some lotion. Lotion? It won't be lotion that will do the trick, sir. It's more than that. I need help. I can't stand it anymore. It's Hyde, sir. It's a man I know, Mr. Hyde. It's him that's done it and more. More I can't tell you. He ain't a human. He's a beast. And he won't let me go, sir, and I am afraid to run away. Marcia, she's my girlfriend, and Freddie, that's her friend, they... ...they say it's my nerves, and that you know about such things. And that you could help me. Oh, I can't bear up under it no more! If you can't help me... ...give me some poison so I can kill myself. Why didn't you try to get help before? Why didn't you go to the police? I tell you, I'm afraid. No... ...he ain't a man. He's a devil, he is. He knows what you're thinking about. If he knows I'm here, who knows what he'll do. It won't be nothing human, I can tell you! Oh, please. Please help me keep him off. I'll do anything you ask, sir. I ain't as bad as you might think. Well... Men say that I... I ain't a bad looker when I'm more myself. You liked me once a little, didn't you? Really, you... You're such a fine and kind gentleman. Honest, that night, when you walked out of my place... ...I made as if I didn't care. I did care. After you'd gone, I kept wishing you'd come back. Truly, I did. This man, Hyde, will never trouble you again. I give you my word. How do you know? He'll come back! He'll come back and kill me! No. He won't come back. I'll see to it. Oh, you don't know him, sir. Oh, you don't know him. He ain't human, he ain't! I gave you my word. You'll never see Hyde again. You must believe me. I believe you, sir. I believe you. You must go now. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. For a moment, I thought... Goodbye. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have admitted such a person. I didn't know she was hysterical. That's all right. I'm glad you admitted her. Now, about the wedding, we've got a lot to discuss. - We've never been married before. - Let's not get upset. We'll manage it somehow. - Good evening, Mr. Weller. - Good evening, Dr. Jekyll. A touch of autumn in the air. Very seasonable. - Wonderful, Mr. Weller, wonderful. - Listen here. Remember that comet I was telling you about? The blooming thing didn't hit us after all. - You know why? - No. Why? Because it knew at this moment, across the park... ...Sir Emery is going to announce the marriage of his daughter... ...to the very man you're talking to. - Dr. Jekyll! And my best wishes to the Mrs. Jekyll as is to be. Thank you. You don't mind if I hurry? - Godspeed, Dr. Jekyll. - Thank you, Mr. Weller! Oh. Here's hoping that Hyde rots... ...wherever he is. Burn slow when the time comes. Here's hoping that Dr. Jekyll thinks of his Ivy... ...as I know he'd like to. As his Ivy thinks of him. Because he's an angel. Here's to my angel. Surprised? Couldn't be that you didn't expect to see me? No. I've been... I've been waiting for you. But you've been celebrating. Is there some new event, some change? No. No. I just thought... You've just been drinking to calm your nerves, huh? It is your nerves, isn't it? Perhaps you should see a doctor. No. No, I don't need a doctor. Would you like to have some wine, sir? I'll get you another glass. Dr. Jekyll's a good man. Yes, Dr. Henry Jekyll. - Is he? - Yes. Yes. And a fine gentleman too. Different than any man you might know. Yes. Yes. "A nice, fine gentleman like yourself, sir... ...wouldn't be knowing such a person. " No. "I ain't such a bad looker, sir, when I'm more myself. " Yes. He's the kind of man you can get down on your knees to, isn't he? A sweet, dear, pure man that you can trust and believe. He's a smug, hypocritical coward, that's what he is! - You couldn't know him! - I know him intimately. And I detest him intimately... ...from his lofty brain to the soles of his virtuous feet! And you, you... "I'll do anything you ask, sir. " Well, you saw him, didn't you? You saw the respectable fool. Clutched his halo and held it straight, didn't he! How do you know all that? I know everything you do and think. Dr. Jekyll wouldn't tell you. He ain't the kind of... And as you were leaving the room, you turned at the door, didn't you? And you said, "For a moment, I thought... " What did you think? What did you think? Did you think Dr. Jekyll was falling in love with you? You, with your cheap little dreams? Or did you think, perhaps... ...that in him, you saw a bit of me, Hyde? Oh, but it confuses you, doesn't it? It isn't quite clear, is it? Oh... What are you going to do? Something so simple. I'm going to put an end to all that confusion. Please, sir! Oh, no! Please, no! Yes, dance. Dance and dream. Dream that you're Mrs. Henry Jekyll of Harley Street... ...dancing with your own butler and six footmen. Dream they've all turned into white mice and crawled into an eternal pumpkin. Here, you in there! Open this here door! Police! - Ivy! - I'm going in. Governor! Ho, there! Hey, you there! Look here, governor. - Steady! Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Police! Chase him, somebody! Get a copper! Police! Hurry. Come on, open up! Let me in. I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's. - Dr. Jekyll's not home. - He told me to wait. - I know all Dr. Jekyll's friends. - Let me in! - You'll have to come back. - Let me in, or I'll bash this door... If you don't go away, I'll have to send for the police! That's him! There he goes! - This ain't no place to rob. - But robbed it is! Help! Police! - Good night, Charles. - Good night. - Sorry your young man was detained. - So am I, Uncle Geoffrey. Good evening, sir. There was a ring at the door a while ago, sir. When I answered it, there was nobody there. I found this. You don't happen to know what Dr. Jekyll uses these for? No, sir, I don't rightly know. I don't rightly know, sir. - Have you got it? - What are you doing hiding behind...? I was waiting for you, Dr. Lanyon. I'm the man from Dr. Jekyll. - The package, I'll take it. - Step inside. No, no! There's not time. As Jekyll's friend, I have the right to ask you a few questions. Come now, don't waste time with prying questions. - Let me have it... - I don't like your attitude. - Suppose you introduce yourself. - Hyde. What difference does that make? - You an acquaintance of Jekyll? - Yes. Yes, of course. I'm an old friend. Now let me have the... Where is Dr. Jekyll? - Don't worry, he's alive. - What's the matter? Is he ill? - No! He's perfectly all right. - Very well, then. - I'll come with you and see for myself. - You pretentious fool! - You take another step, I'll shoot. - Now, wait a minute, Lanyon. I can't let you come with me, and I can't tell you any more. - Why not? - Because. Because. I warn you, don't stick your nose into this. You'd better let me go, Lanyon. - You can ask Jekyll about it tomorrow. - You'll take me to Jekyll this minute. For the last time, Lanyon, would you let me leave alone? - No. - All right. All right, then. Let it be on your own head. Now, once again, Lanyon... ...will you let me take this glass and go? No, why should I? For your own sake, Lanyon. Whatever you're going to do, get on with it! I warned you, John. Even as Hyde, I warned you. You see what you've done, don't you? I mean, you, you've gone beyond. You've tampered with... You've committed the supreme blasphemy. I know, John. I know, I know. - You must destroy the formula. - I've done that. No, I mean, you must destroy it from your mind! You can't take this again! I know. I know. I know. Tonight... Tonight, on my way to Sir Charles'... You see, I thought I could control... But tonight this change, this thing you saw, happened without my... - What about Bea? - I'll tell her. At least I have strength enough left for that. Darling. I heard you playing... ...and I thought we could talk in here... ...just as well as anywhere. Well, of course, dear. I can't imagine how you felt last night when I... You don't have to explain anything. I know it must have been important. You know that I'd forgive anything... But that's it, you mustn't forgive anymore! You must make up your mind to... Tell me, darling, what's wrong? What is it, Harry? Look at me. Please, Bea... Let me begin... There's no way to begin except to tell you. Tell me what? You're... You're a brave girl, aren't you? Yes. That's why I can tell you like this, because you are brave and strong. Always remember that. Bea, we can't be married. I must never see you again. Oh, you... You don't know what you... Harry, what's happened? Look at me! Just that. Just that. That's all I can tell you. But, why? What...? We've always said that there's nothing we couldn't discuss. Nothing secret between you and me, ever. Don't ask any more, please. If you ever trusted me, trust me now. It's for your happiness and mine, believe me. That's all I can say. Oh, my darling! Are you ill? - There's something you... - No, no. Bea, don't ask me any more. Don't try to understand. Just take my word. Now, please go. This is so wrong of me. To make you go through all of this. You're trying not to hurt me, aren't you? Harry... Harry, it's all right... ...if you don't love me anymore. - I know things like that can happen. - Bea. Oh, you do. You still do. - What is it, dearest? - Bea, Bea, darling. No. Don't say anything more. Just hold me close. Goodbye, darling. Harry! Harry, please! Please come back! Please don't... Harry! You did come back. Oh, my darling. Father! Father! Beatrix! Beatrix! Help! Help! What's the matter, sir? What's wrong, sir? - Help! - Look! There he goes! There he goes! There he goes! Hey, stop there! Hey! Hey! What's going on?! Hold it, you! This is the weapon, doctor. Yes. I... If you'll come with me, inspector. Ward, you remain here. Dr. Jekyll, that frightful maniac broke into the house. - Did he attack you, sir? - Yes. - Which way did he go? Out here? - Didn't know you were home, sir. - Are you badly hurt? - No. No, I'll be all right. This here door's locked. - We'd better go out that way. - Yes. Wait! - There. Heaven help him. - Dr. Lanyon... ...but I know this gentleman. He's Dr. Jekyll. I know. Nevertheless, there's your man. I'm sorry, sir, but I know Dr. Jekyll. I've known him for years. - This is your master, isn't it? - Of course, sir. No doubt of it. - We must have lost him. Come, men. - No, no. Wait. Tell them, Jekyll. Tell them. It's no use, Jekyll. You know it's no use. I beg of you, Jekyll, tell them who you are. - Tell them what you've done. - I've done nothing. I'm Dr. Jekyll. I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll. I've done nothing. I'm Dr. Jekyll. I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll, I tell you. I've done nothing. You're looking for a man named Hyde. Hyde! I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll. I'm Dr. Jekyll, I tell you! I tell you, I'm Dr. Jekyll! I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll! It's no use, Jekyll. You'd better come quietly. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the path of righteousness, for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
