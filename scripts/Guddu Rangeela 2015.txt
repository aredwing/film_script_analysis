Once a man went on a world tour, to London. He arrived in London. And, while roaming around he needed to pee. He stood before a wall and started peeing. Suddenly...'the London Police arrived. They arrested him and took him to the police station. Anyway... he got out of there and arrived in India. Here he noticed that anyone can pee anywhere. He noticed Ghanta Singh peeing in front of a huge wall. He walked up to him and said.. "Singh sir.." "doesn't the police catch when you're peeing?" To which Singh sir replied. "No... one has to do it by himself." That's the end of Guddu's joke. But coming up next is.. Yours, truly... Mirpur's Kumar Sanu. One and only item". Rangeela! First, heartiest congratulations to.. ..Lambardar Chaudhary Nafe Singh's son Vinod Singh.. "for getting a visa to Kenya." I wish that the lads from our area keep getting visas.. "and they keep throwing such visa parties." What else could one ask for? So let's begin, with a modern devotional song. And the song's called "Mata's Email". Clap! So how much money does that Lumbardar have? Not much... He was all show, no go. His wife though was hot. But his safe was dry and cold! Around 10-12 kilos oi gold.. "and 5-7 lakhs in cash. That's it. Did you check properly" ..or were you busy inside? Why're you being jealous? You could've joined in. There was room for two. That's all he has. Fine... ...we'll pass the information to Pujari tomorrow morning. Why do we always pass on the information to Pujari? We can do the looting too. I've told you a thousand times. Dont you get it? I dont want to commit a crime. I see. Can I ask a question? What's this that we're doing? If it wasnt for the case.. ..l wouldnt be doing this job either. And your greed will get us killed some day. This isnt greed. We do all the hard work. We do the research. And pass the information to Pujari? Why? And what do we get? Jack squat. Think about it, bro. If we do this job ourselves. "we can be millionaires in a month." And when the month's over? They'll put so many bullets in your backside... ...youll never even be able to sit again. A little hard work and information gets us a square meal. Learn to be happy. When will you think beyond the one square meal? Why cant we be gangsters? Come. Come on, I'll make you a gangster. Come. Bro where are you taking me? You want to be a gangster, dont you? Here. Hold it. Take it. See that man? - Shoot him. - He hasnt done me any harm? Why would I shoot him? Why? Scared? You're a gangster, aren't you? Shouldn't make a difference who you kill. Shoot him. - Shoot. - L.. I'll shoot him. I'm serious. Shoot. Think again, Rangeela, I will shoot him. Shoot! Gangster. Shoot! Keep it. You win, I lose. Okay? You always do this to me whenever I talk some sense. No guts..but wants all the glory. Lambardar Nafe Singh. From Palawaas? Believe me, hes a gold mine. His boys got a visa and hes going abroad. The guy's loaded. I've never seen women decked with so much gold. At least 40-50 kilos of gold. And cash... Not a penny less than 2.5 million. Youve been making really tall claims these days. Remember that incident about the doctor from Ambala. "Pujari... hes loaded." "He eats in a silver platter." "Sleeps on a bed made of gold." But I didnt get a single penny when I raided his home. Took four boxes of Crocin, and they were also fake. This is a sacred place. Atleast you shouldnt lie in a temple. What's this? 10,000? - Pujari, that's too less. - Give it back. Sell your information to someone else. No no... Its OK, we accept. And yes, raid his mace between 10pm and 11pm. That's the time when the power supply's cut. And listen, dont get too trigger happy and shoot. The Chaudhary has a number of guns. ' Maradona. 'Messi-baba' . This is there too! Hand me the trishool. The triangle. Give it to me. Mangey Ram, what are you doing here with that candle? You tell me what you're doing here. This is my heist. How can this be your heist? I paid 10,000 rupees Guddu Rangeela. "for giving me the information of this house." Oh hello! Pujari... l paid them 50,000 as well. Now get lost. Here comes the 3rd one. Now who's coming? Khayali, who sold you information of this place? Guddu Rangeela. I paid them 20,000 rupees. Now, Run away you two. Listen..I paid them too. You both, get lost. You think this is a tea party. Get lost, and you too uncle. You two get lost. You two get lost. ..because I paid the highest price tor this information. Get lost! Hands up. "I paid them too" ..so that they dont squeal about my wealth. Bloody rascals. Hands up! Arghhh! Guddu Rangeela! Come in. - I hope no one saw you coming in? - No. Here you go. That's 80,000. Look, Rangeela... ...l know you very well. I wonder where you get all this money from? But lady justice is not taking her blindfold off. The decision could be against our favor. Dont blame me if anything goes wrong. What are you saying? Blame you? Youve done so much for us. Youve been fighting our war for the past 10 years. You didnt even let us get revealed. Just tell us how much money you need, and we'll arrange for it. If we lose here, we'll approach the higher court. We'll do what we can. The rest is His will. Whether He makes us win or lose? Greetings, sir. Where are the boy and girl? We nabbed them last night at Sonipat Bus Depot. And according to the Council's decision.. "we chopped the boy up last night, and dumped his body in the canal." And the girl? That's the problem, sir. The girl belongs to our community. The Council's decided .. "that her own family will have to kill her." But I dont understand why, Amichand is falling weak. He says she's his only daughter. And what about the humiliation she caused us? And the Council's decision? That's exactly why we called Don Billoo here for. Billo sir. Billo sir. Careful..the girl's father has a gun. - Chote! - Yes, brother. Dont come forward, or I will shoot. Listen to me, Amichand, this wont benefit anyone. I'll shoot...! I'm serious. What will you get by shooting me, Amichand? I am here to talk with you. Believe me... ...we'll do as you say. Come on... hand me the gun now. Come on. Bravo. Shes my only daughter. I was blessed with her after praying for years. Shes just a kid, and she made a mistake. How can I strangle my own daughter? The Council's gone crazy. I know, Amichand. I know. Be strong. Your daughter's like my child too. What to do? There have been many instances. "when the Council had to take stern decisions." "to preserve the norms of our society." Sit. Everyone loves their child. Last year, when your daughter passed her 12th exams.. ..l brought a cake for her from Rohtak. Remember? Think about it, Amichand. Your daughter was missing for a week.. ..with a boy that belonged to an interior caste. Shes tarnished everything. Now... we'll have to clear this blemish, Amichand. One has to sever the limb that goes bad. Almighty Lord Shiva has given you an opportunity to earn merit. What merit will I earn by killing my own daughter? Karma! You know the Council's decision cannot be averted. If you dont do it, someone else will. Hail Lord Shankar! This isnt right, Gulab Singh. Earlier the inspector would cordially invite us to the police station. Why treat us like terrorists now? You see... my father used to say. You have to save all your 'NO's for the house. And 'yes' for your work... Sir said arrest and I arrested you. We always send him his share. So why did he need to arrest us? I wasnt even allowed to nish my lm! The inspector's been suspended, Guddu? Why? Well... in his drunken stupor "the inspector sent an MMS to the DSP's wife. Madam replied, "This is not the way." The inspector thought she's flirting back. He sent her a love-letter along with an blue lm CD. He was saying, "What has happened, Gulab Singh?" I said, "You and your extra-marital affairs." I was going through some old les. 16 burglaries in six months. And the investigation proves.. ..you both performed in each of these houses one day before the burglary. Sir... were just ordinary orchestra party players. Sir... were just ordinary orchestra party players. You two sing less... and make others dance more. But, sir... I'm not in the mood to thrash anyone today, early in the morning. Just had a prayer meeting at home. I just got posted here. Paid 5 million to get transferred here. I had to mortgage my wifes jewelry to arrange the money. I promised to give her back double before the next Karwa Chauth. You make some contribution too. Pay me one million... and continue with your singing and dancing. Or else the police will have to do their job. But, sir... what can the police do without evidence? What? What can the police do? You fool... you should better be asking what all can the police do. The police can recover a CD of Ghulam Ali from your pocket. "and brand you a terrorist." Take your photograph outside a beauty salon.. "and prove you're a pimp." You know what baby powder is? We can recover a packet from your pocket. "and make you a drug smuggler." What's more... we can match. - But hes dead. - Who knows? Have you seen him? Look... I've an opportunity in both my hands. Either you pay me one million.. ..or I'll accuse you for all these 16 burglaries. "and get the Bravery Award from the Commissioner!" Now you decide what you want to do. Good day. Now leave. This way. Come on. What can the police do? Where will we get one million? I dont know. Welcome, mister. You took longer than expected. "What the" I told you we were making a mistake. Now be prepared to get shot. Look, Pujari, I know you're angry. Lower the gun and I'll explain everything. Why dont you explain us as well? And... dont forget us. He was the only one missing. Now explain to them all. Look... its not like you all think. What else is it? It's exactly what you all think it is. We duped all of you! Do you want to get us killed? Have you lost your mind? It was an emergency. I needed money. You wouldnt have lent me even if I had asked. So we sold the same information to all three. You can shoot me if you like. - But shoot him rst. - Rangeela. - Because this dumb idea was his. - What are you saying? I am hungry. I will die only after I nish lunch. Rangeela! Bro! Bro, why are you leaving me alone? Listen to me. Cold hearted man! So... What about you, handsome? Rangeela. Pujari, theres a bottle of pickle behind you. Just hand it to me. The lime one. Dont forget, my names Rangeela. If you try to mess with me.. I'll shoot once, but for the rest of the six months youll exhale smoke! And my names Guddu. Even if I dont shoot you. For 6 months youll also exhale smoke... Bro, I am sure... Someones squealing on us. We'll have to nd out who. - I know who. - Who? - Gora Bengali. - Why that. Really!?... Stop! Where do you think you're going, Bengali? What did you think? You can escape after squealing on us. I swear... I swear I didnt do it. I quit my job as a police informer. - Dont lie, Bengali. - I swear on my kids. Here. Now I handle Underworld's PR. Being a Police informer is much more risky. One information and the entire gang comes after you. Even the Police cant dare to touch the Underworlds informer. Why were you following us? I've a job for you two. - It's a proposal. - Dont lie, Bengali. I swear on my kids. Would I falsely swear on my kids? What's the proposal? Look, Rangeela, I'll be frank with you. You two are stuck in a big mess. Inspector Ajay Singh... is a corrupt officer. And I know... you dont have one million to give him. "But... I've a job for you two" "through which you can earn a million in two days." A million in two days?! What's the job? It's simple. You just need to pick up something from one place. "and transfer it to another." What? Look, Rangeela, dont get charged up. First hear me out. You see... theres a girl you need to pick up from Chandigarh. "and deliver her to Delhi. That's it." Look, Bengali, we dont do kidnappings. Kidnap.. You dont have to kidnap her. It's like this, I've a client in Delhi. Hes a big-shot business man. His daughter lives in Chandigarh. "The girl's deaf and mute" "and she teaches at a school in Chandigarh." But she... has fallen for some useless boy. Her family tried everything they could.. "but the girl doesnt seem to agree." With no other options left, her family xed her marriage. Now I've taken the contract. "to deliver the girl to her wedding." That's all. How much are you getting? Two million. One for you... and one for me. Come here.. We'll do this job. Say yes. "Say yes?" It's a kidnapping after all. Guddu, we wont kidnap anyone. Then what else will you do? Go to jail... ...get blamed for 16 burglaries. And what about the case? If we get locked up, who will defend the case? Take my advice for once. Just say yes, we dont have another option. When do we leave? Tomorrow morning. Do you like Salman or Shahrukh? Yes, Bengali? ...Did you do the job? The job's done. Weve just left Chandigarh. We'll be in Delhi in a couple of hours. - No, no... dont come to Delhi yet. - Why? Theres a problem. The client's haggling over the price. What are you saying? Yes... we'll get the money late. Until then we'll have to keep the girl somewhere safe. Shes not a packet of opium that I can hide away. Where do I take her? I know..take her to Shimla. I know a guy there. He'll give you a place to stay for few a days. - Look, Bengali, you're just. - Dont worry. I am there. You will get your money. Yeah, but. It's only for a couple of days, Rangeela. You can comfortably live here for the next couple of days. I've made all arrangements for your food. Liquor... weve got imported, have fun. Whose house is this? It belongs to a foreigner lady. She comes down here once in 2-4 years. I am the caretaker. Your name? Chunnilal. Chunnilal! Rangeela! Shes getting away. Stop. I'm doing it. Pull your hand in. Stop, or else I will shoot. Stop! Stop or I'll shoot. Stop! Shes deaf, how's she going to hear you? Get down there. Stop the car! S This is an insult to us. - We should've shot her. - Are you crazy? Shoot a girl?! - You didnt tie her properly? - No I tied her properly! You two are back? Bengali... was making such tall claims. He said you two were like 'Jai-Veeru' from 'Sholay' You two failed so pathetically. Couldn't even handle a single girl. What's she doing here? Where else would she go? Acting smart, are you? Tell me what's going on here, or I will blow your brains out. Dont shoot him inside the house. I dont like bloodshed in the house. She isnt deaf and mute? Why? Dont you like me talking? I can answer your question. But Bangali's asked me not to do so. How about some breakfast. ..while we're waiting for him? Do you eat omelets? - Why did you run in the rst place? - She was testing you two. Like 'Thakur' in 'Sholay' But you two failed, sorry! The Sessions Court today acquitted Billoo Pehalwan of all charges. ..regarding a 10 year old case in Mirpur which involved the Council. Let me remind you, Billoo Pehalwan was accused of murdering two people. Human Rights worker and Lawyer BP Gupta. ..whos been defending this case for 10 years now.. ..has decided to appeal against this verdict in the district court. Do you know what you're saying, Mr. President? Now that the court case is over.. ..l should make Billoo a Minister? You do know about his image, dont you? I want to give a clean-image government to the people. I want to encourage educated and honest people. "and not goons like him." - But, madam.. - No it's or buts. Frankly speaking, I would throw people like Billoo out of the party. Including them in the cabinet is out of the question. Youre making a mistake, madam. We might need Billoo again during the elections. "If only your father was alive today" ..he would've denitely understood this. Times have changed, Mr. President. Look, at any cost... the government's image should remain intact. That's all. Anyway, let's keep all this aside and have lunch. Come on. Look... l dont like twisting words. I'll tell you the entire story. So you already know... she isnt deaf or mute. But she teaches children that are deaf and mute. That's true. Shes from a rich family, true. But her family is miserly. But this girl... she's ambitions. When things couldn't be sorted the right way.. "we had to use other means." With God's grace... she ran into me. We made a plan. The girl agreed to be kidnapped willingly. I knew it... somethings wrong. - Come, Guddu. - Were not doing anything wrong. Were only helping the girl. It's social work. To hell with your social work. Pay us our share and do whatever you want. What will you do with the money? Dont be so sentimental, Rangeela. We'll get at least 100 million as ransom money. 100 million? 20 million each. Our lives will be set. Tell me something, Bengali. Anyone could've done this job. Why us? Good question. Now finally, youve asked the right question. I've known you two for years. You two are rascals. Make shifters. But you two are honest. It's hard to nd such honest people in this business. And what's more important. You share an old connection with this girls family. Which family is she from? Her name is Baby. And she's Don Billoo's sister-in-law, Rangeela. You were all praises about them, Bengali. Can they do the job? 100 percent. I've carefully selected these two. Don Billoo is their weakness. You see.. When crime gets a personal touch, it becomes passionate. Who is it? - Uncle. - Rangeela. Bless you. - Daughter-in-law. - Hello, Uncle. - Look whos here. - Guddu! Look at him. How are you, Guddu? Your sister-in-law. Take her blessings. - Hello, sister-in-law. - It's okay. - Go get some sweets. - Yes. Fine. Be back soon. - Are you two okay? - Yes. Rangeela, you two shouldnt have come here. The villagers are very angry. And everything that was published in the media.. ..has added to their rage. The Council held a meeting yesterday. They have decided to kill you two. Uncle, I have married Babli. And inter-caste marriage is not a crime by law. Our case was even brought up in the Parliament. The Chandigarh High Court has given us Police Security. How can anyone just kill us? No, sir... This is the community's internal problem. The Law shouldnt interfere. But were their security given by the court. I'll ll your backside with bullets. Even your children will be born of metal. Go and sit there. I'm sending tea and snacks for you. Go. Come on. They will never accept this relationship. Were a family of musicians, and they are upper caste people. They are here. Kashiram, open the door! They wont spare you. Leave. I say run. Rangeela, take care of my Guddu! Go, go! They must have run out the backdoor. Go kill them. Come on. Look, hes trying to run away from there. Catch him. Don Billoo. Don Billoo! Stop! Rangeela. Babli! Babli! Lawyer Sir, Rangeela speaking. We wont appeal in the High court. We'll have to settle this outside the court. Yes. Happy birthday, Don Billoo. Happy birthday, Don Billoo. The number you're calling is currently switched off. Please call again later. The number you're calling is currently switched off. Please call again later. The number you're calling is currently switched off. - Chhotey. - Yes, brother. When did you last talk to baby? Around 5-6 days ago. What happened? Nothing. I wonder where she is. Her numbers unreachable too. She was saying "I'll definitely attend brother-in-laws birthday". She was also talking about some special gift for your birthday. Special gift? Well then... call up at Chandigarh, and nd out what's wrong. - Yes. - And listen. Dont get too drunk. First call her and inform me. Come on. Baby, where are you? I'm sure Baby didnt make it, Don Billoo. " Who?" Who's speaking? Baby didnt come to your party. Shes angry with you? - Why? - Because... ...she's in our custody. Do you know... who you're talking to? I do. But you dont know... who you're talking to. What do you want? I'll call when I decide. Happy birthday. I told you nd out about Baby, didn't l? Very good morning. Your brother-in-laws heart skipped a beat last night. Rangeela can do anything once he makes up his mind. He called him from inside Billoo's own house. Just watch... ...how your brother-in-laws going to dance to our tunes. "In fact, we can even turn him into a rooster" "and he'll crow every morning." That reminds me of a joke... Shall I tell you? Fine, if you insist so much, I'll tell you. Once a hen went to a shop and said.. "Give me two eggs." The shopkeeper replied, "Dont you lay eggs?" The hen replied, "Yes, I do." But my rooster said, "Why spoil your figure for two rupees?" I must admit one thing. Youre really shrewd and crafty. What a charade. You dont look so dangerous. Even you dont look as stupid as you are. What the". Youre exactly my type. Loudmouth. Listen. Listen. Can I ask you something frankly? Go ahead. - Will you tell anyone? - Say it already? Will you give me some... ahem? Have you seen your face? Dog! Hello, sir. Come. Greetings, sir. Move Back. All the goons, thugs, chain-snatchers, gangsters. ..l rounded up everyone last night. In fact..I even got small-time crooks. Sir, can I say something. God's blessed me with a short body but a cunning brain. My experience says it's not one of them. Excuse me, sir. Hello. Weve traced the kidnapper's location. What the". This call was made from your home. Is there a traitor amongst you sir? Heres the dictionary of the Underworld. - Sir.. - What have you got? I dont understand this case. Someone kidnapped one of your family members?! These are really dark times. Come to the point. Dont worry, sir, they will be apprehended soon. You just relax and watch. Find them soon... or else you wont survive either. Move Back! Hello, Shimla Apple store. Give the phone to Rangeela. Yeah, Bengali. Rangeela, the place is burning up. Yes. The rascal's in a bad condition. He hasnt slept all night. Hes making the police run all around the city. I say..the iron is hot. Before they nd any clue about it, strike hard. Fix a meeting for the ransom and get the money. What happened? What was he saying? He was saying, the iron's hot, and we should strike now. Fix a meeting for the ransom. Hes right. Make the call. I suggest that we'll take his money.. "and also shoot him." We wont get the money so easily, Guddu. Why? Somethings wrong. But, Everything's clear now. What's wrong now? There. That's the problem. Were sc here, and you're humming a song. What? What are you? She must be humming to hide her tension. You see.. "Why would a scoundrel like Billoo, who cares for no one" ..pay 100 million for a cheap b like you. Tell me the truth. What do you care? Mind your business. Am I talking to you? Stand there quietly. Rangeela, stay in your limits. Guddu, give him a tight slap. He should see stars in a single blow. How dare you slap me? Hey... 3 years ago my sister got married to Billoo. But my sister was never happy in that house. My Father left no stone unturned in the marriage. He fulfilled all their demands for dowry.. "and gave them all that he could." But Billoo would bother my sister for dowry. He would beat her up. And he would bring other women in front of my sister, and". And one day suddenly we heard that she committed suicide. I knew it was a lie. She was murdered. "Because within a year of my sister's death" ..Billoo married the Aggarwal Builder's only daughter. That was the moment I decided.. "to avenge my sister's death." Recover all the money given in dowry with interest. I got in touch with Billoo again. And started visiting his home more often. I have many videos of his sleaziness. If this CD is leaked, his political career will be over. But Billoo was growing suspicious. He was trying to convince me to come back. But I knew I couldnt face him alone. That's when I met Bengali, and". You know the rest. He will pay 100 million for this CD, not for this cheap b You turned out to be one of those emotional types. I was thinking otherwise. That rascal has... ...ruined all our lives. You know... ...he burned my father alive. If it wasnt for Rangeela. I can't imagine what would've happened to me. But after meeting you I feel, Rangeela is right. Our time has come. You'll catch a cold. Here, take the shawl. My 100 million. What's the news? They called asking for the ransom. How much? 100 million. Where did they call you? Chandigarh Rock Garden. The real fun will begin now. We'll teach them a lesson.. they'll never forget for generations to come. Those two rascals will regret they were ever born. I want to fly to Rock Garden right now. Yes. Why do you think theres two? L...l.. Two... Normally there are 2-4 people in a gang. That's why... No! You didnt say two or four. You said.. "Those two rascals will regret they were ever born." Why did you say two, you oaf? I just guessed.. 0177.. Where does the code belong to, Chhotey? That's Shimla's code. But, you're from Kolkata. Who's there in Shimla? I ordered some apples for my family. Must be his number. You see, because my father's unwell. How odd. By now we should be reaching Chandigarh to receive the ransom Rangeela! Why should Bengali be calling now?! Answer it. Okay. - Shimla Apple Store. - What's the rate of apples? Which ones? Kinnori are Rs. 145 per kilo, and Manali is Rs. 165 per kilo. Hello? Who is speaking? Billoo! I told you it's the apple store's number. "By the way, If you want to order some for yourself" ..order the ones from Manali, theyre very juicy. Don Billoo... we've traced the location oi the second call. It was from Shimla. Now you're stuck Obama! Break his leg! I dont know anything. Youve made him look like a ghost. But he still hasnt said anything. No... Sir... Please believe me, sir. I've worked so many years for you. I swear on my kids. I've worked so many years for you. Will you speak up? Guddu. Rageela! Come on, surround the place. Check upstairs. Check inside. Come on. Go. They ran away. I told you...'they weren't going to wait for us here. Everyone, go out! How's the movie, my dear brother-in-law? Baby?! I've waited really long for this. I wont spare you without taking my revenge. Get that. And ii this CD'S leaked.. ..the CM will never let you set toot in the Parliament. And it's not difficult for me to get to the CM. After all, I am her MLA's only sister-in-law. I knew it... This had to be your plan. The day I get my hands on you.. ..l will skin you alive. Remember, I wield the power oi Lord Shiva's third eye. Every time it opens, there will be destruction. Bro... What if theyre holding Bengali on the top floor? We'll send him a message. "Sorry..not reachable". Bengalis one of us. We cant leave him to die. We'll take him back with us. Think about it again. - There must be an army inside. - Only half. The other halfs gone to Shimla. Fine... come on then, let's go. - Where are you going? - Let's go. I am going inside, and you, will wait by the car. Why? I am coming along too. I am not a kid anymore. I can get Bengali out of there alone. - Alone? - Of course. Fine, then you go and I'll wait by the car. Fine... l am going alone, brother. Go already. Until you go, you can't really come back can ye? Bengali. Get up. These people will kill me. Save me. Shhhh... I am here for you. Come and sit on this. Come.. careful. Careful. Where do you think you're going? What exactly are we trying to do over here? Whose phone is this? Losing your phone can be a real pain. You lose all the numbers. - Whose is it? - It's mine. Take better care of it next time. Who are you? Youre holding my hand, sir. What are your intentions? Let go, and I'll tell you. See this. "Once I press my nger" ..your brain would be lying on the floor. You made a big mistake pointing that gun at me. Well. . Answer this. If you shoot someone on their backside. Where will he sht from? The new hole or the old one? How about I shoot you and see? No, I'll shoot yours. Wait, if you move he dies. Tell me, Guddu... left nut or right nut. Left..no, no, right. Youre confusing me now. Another minute, and they wouldve shot you in the bum.. "and mopped the floor with you." Who do you think you are? You think you're some superman? - And I am some kid. - You are a kid. And you will always be one for me. If you like raising kids, go adopt one from the orphanage. - I will slap you. - What youll slap! Shut up! Have you two gone crazy? Dont let them escape. Are you here to rescue me or get me killed? More people are coming in. Settle your stupid tight later. First save yourself. What the... The rascals dug up his entire backyard no? - Did they insert the ENTIRE rod? - You think this is funny. Its killing me. Your condition reminds me of a joke. Shut up. I'll tell you if you're insisting. Just Look... Bengali... listen. Once a lion had terrorized a village. Many great hunters came, but they just couldnt kill the lion. The villagers were worried. One day Ghanta Singh arrived in the village. He said "l will kill the lion". The villagers asked "But How?". "Many great hunters tried, but they just couldnt kill him." "He devoured all of them." Ghanta Singh said "It's quite simple". "Make a replica of a cow and leave it in the jungle." "l will sit inside the statue, with my gun." "The lion will think it's a cow." "As soon as he shows himself, I will shoot him." The villagers made a replica of a cow.. "and left Mr. Singh in the jungle." The entire night passed, there was no trace, neither of the lion nor of Ghanta Singh. The villagers went in the jungle searching for him.. and noticed the cow's statue was broken and lying on the ground. They got Ghanta Singh out of the statue and asked.. "Singh sir, what happened to the lion?" To which he replied "To hell with the lion". First tell me... who untied and left the bull free last night!!! Left the bull untied. Careful you rascal. Sorry. Sorry. Youre laughing after a very long time. Where do you get all these jokes from? Hey... l dont get them from anywhere, I make them up! Theyre all original. Can I ask you something?

Rangeela, when you fell in love with Babli.. ..did you feel something in your heart too? You know, those strange feelings, like needles pricking your whole body? Sleep now, it's quite late. Look at him sleeping so soundly while weve been running around. Pull his blanket off. Hey hero.. Hey. Hey.. Come on, get up. Scared to see us? Son, the police even found Saddam, you think we cant nd you. The rest of your gang is sitting in the car. What do you want to do? No, no, no... dont even try. We dont have any orders to kill you. But we do have the orders to beat you to an inch of your life. Dont force me to do so. Bring him along. Stand up. Have you informed sir, that weve arrested the tourists in Shimla. Yes, I called him. Come on. - Gulab Singh.. - Come on. Gulab Singh, I have to go to the toilet. What? I have to go urgently, please tell your sir. Sir.. He wants to go s. Nothing doing. Sir, the pressure's building.. Please explain to him. What do we do? Let him go, two men accompany him. Fine. Don't you have anything else to do in the morning? Why dont you eat laxatives? And if youve a bad stomach, just eat two bananas. It will jam your system, wont even let any air through. Hold on. Keep singing while you're inside.. ..so that we know you're still in there. Dont try to do something smart? My names Gulab Singh. And I'm the boss! Theres no fun in singing alone. Let's play 'Antakshari' 'Antakshari'. I'm a Antakshari Champion. Sing from Guddu. - M? - Yeah!

Heartiest congratulations to all the newly wed couples. Greetings to all the elders. And love to the children. This group marriage will help. ..in mending the image of our community that's been tarnished. Sir... theres bad news. We had Guddu Rangeela in our custody in Shimla. But they escaped. There was shooting. We ran after them, but. We'll catch them, sir, you dont worry.. Hello, Billoo? How are you doing? Just face me once, and I will whoop you like a dog. I have something similar on my mind. The day we meet, you will have no place to run. Anyway, I called to give you a wedding invitation. - Whose marriage? - Your mothers marriage. Baby's getting married...'to Guddu. Youre the brides family, so you must give dowry. Bring 100 million, to Narkhandha's Hatu peak. Day after tomorrow morning. Come alone. If you try to be smart, we know how to skin someone alive. What the". First do his odd jobs, and then get slapped by him too. That's the fact. It's alright, sir. He pays us also. I admit... were corrupt, dishonest. We live for no one but ourselves. I admit to everything. But don"t we have any Serf-respect? Of course we do. People swear on my reputation. Which means my self-respect. And you rascal! You were busy singing in there. Did you go there to sing? - Sorry, sir. - Sorry. I made a mistake. But I won the competition. You know... it felt like he slapped me, not you. - Stop talking nonsense. - Honestly. - Shut up. - Okay, sir. That's Lawyer Gupta. He was defending the case against Billoo. He is. Who's that with him? That's the cinema hall guard. I had brought Guddu Rangeela to the police station. "from the cinema hall he guards." Apparently hes some distant relative of theirs. That old man... Guddu Rangeela's uncle. Whose uncle? I just told you. Guddu and Rangeela! When were you going to tell me such an important detail? - Why didnt you tell me? - No one asked. My father used to say.. .. if you speak without being asked.. ..you're self-respect goes down the drain. Your father was absolutely right. - Listen to me. - Yes sir. Sir, no problem. It hardly matte rs. Lawyer sir, hello. How are things? I am sure you know this lawyer. And this mustached guy is Guddu and Rangeela's uncle. Now I understand their story. That's not even their real name, Don. I told you this was something else? I told you this is not about the ransom, it's something else. You thought your brother's just blabbering. I am sure youve understood everything now. Uncle..tell me the names oi your boys. Guddu's name... Guddu's name... is Gulshan Ram. Son of... Son of Kashi Ram. Kashi Ram. And Rangeela? Rajesh Ram. - Husband of.. - Babli Hooda. - Village? - Mirpur. I must admit, Lord. You work in mysterious ways. A ten year old mistake has raised its head again. - Listen... - Yes, brother. I slapped you, didnt l? It's okay. Now slap me. No, sir. What are you saying? - Slap me. - I cant do it. Slap me or I will shoot you! Sorry, sir. One has to pay for the crimes he has committed. Chhotey, call an urgent Council meeting. And get ready to go to Punjab. But what about them? Bury them. Alive? Will you.. Will you make me do all of your work? Hello, uncle. Hello. 10 years ago, I helped you. And now her times up. Is everything ne? Sir..take everything we have, but spare my daughter. Sorry, uncle. I cant make the same mistake again. What are you doing here? We called Billoo. Wheres the money? My Brother didnt give me any money. - Did you come here to die? - No. Brother has sent this. Let me know if it works. That's Babli! - Babli's alive? - Yes. They are standing right there. It's all about fate, Rangeela. Destiny can be really confusing sometimes. Neither you nor I can die without settling our scores. Now.. Consider this as a warning. Not a letter or a telegram. Come soon. Babli's waiting for you. Sir... you're have the trump card now, and you will win. But those two are rascals. Do you think they will come? The calf is in my custody. Those two cows will have to come. Excuse me, sir. My heart says something isnt right. - Sir.. - Quiet. Think about the reward, not the means of reaching it. If he hears you, even your children will be widowed. Let's go. Children ...widowed? How? Excuse me, sir. My respected Council members. Today Billoo's standing before you.. "to solve a 10 year old mystery." Take a good look, she's the same girl. Babli Hooda, who eloped with a different caste boy.. "and tarnished our reputation." I shot her. And the bullet even hit her. But it was my bad luck that she survived. When I went to the hospital to kill her.. ..her father's money made me weak. I let her live... ...and lied to all of you. I said I killed her and buried her alive. I am your culprit. The Council trusted me... ...and I broke that trust. But look at the Almighty's divine play. He gave another chance to a sinner like me. Babli and her husband... Rajesh Ram, aka Rangeela. "are alive." In front of all of you, I solemnly promise... that I'll hang these two dead bodies, from that tree in two days.. ..or bow down in front of all of you in shame. Bro... Baby's calling. Wait. Speak. - Did you reach? - Yes, I did. I am waiting for him. Look, do just like I said. And be there on time. And remember, one small mistake can ruin everything. I know, hes a rascal. He can do anything. Hes already done what he had to. Now it's our turn. Look after yourself. Were prepared, Rangeela. Weve got all the stuff. Just tell me... when do we attack? How long have you been in this business? Do I have to tell you that? Here come the bloody orchestra? Where are your instruments? Wheres Babli? Youre in a hurry to meet Babli arent you?! Dont worry, she is safe. Handover my sister-in-law. Or else you will regret it. - Chhotey. - Yes, brother. He's also a manly man no? Many talk of Robin hood who never shot with his bow. Rascals, I will shoot you two at the village square. People dont call me Don Billoo the Lion for no reason. Can I ask you a question? Did your mother have to go to the jungle, or did the Lion come to her house? People of Mirpur, these are your culprits. This is the consequence of going against the Council. "We'll punish them so severely" "that their future generations will think twice.." ..before breaking the norms of our community. Glory to...'the Village Council! Glory to...'the Village Council! Glory to...'the Village Council! Glory to...'the Village Council! Glory to...'the Village Council! Forgive me, Babli. I couldnt protect you. High Court's order, police... . . government... ...they all failed. What should I blame you for? I looked everywhere for you. You could've given me at least a sign that you're alive. I was dead that day. I didnt have the power to sacrifice my entire family. They threatened to kill you as well. So I was leading a life of anonymity far away. "The Council, with everyones consent... sentences these two to death" "for breaking the norms and rules of our community." "And... we forgive Don Billoo for his mistake" "and thus give him the responsibility to nish this job." Bravo, uncle. Bravo! The council's must feel proud.. "after sentencing innocent, unarmed people." Hey girl! That's all youve done until now. Uphold the community laws. But when a 12 year old kid is gang raped.. ..where does the Council disappear then? When daughters are burnt alive for dowry.. ..do your elders shower flowers on you. When a unborn child is killed in the womb, because it's a girl.. "what do your village-heads do then?" The village council are meant to be fair, and ensure justice. This is a bunch of cowards! And for hiding their weakness and". Kill the girl. Kill her. Hello. How's everyone? - Hello. - Hello. Hello, madam. - Hello, President. - Hello. - How are you, Billoo? - I'm well. By the grace of Lord Shiva I can see that. Come inside, I want to talk to you. You too. So Billoo, what's all this charade? Are you worried about the party's image or not? I am worried about my communitys tradition. I've a CD of your tradition and norms. What if the CDs leaked? The council will clobber you. And the government's reputation will be tarnished as well. Youre lucky that I've the CD with me. All this is hurting the image of our party. Do you know what the Delhi media calls you? The Taliban of India. They can call me what they like... ..I've sworn in front of 120 village councils, to kill them I cannot go back on this. So you wont listen to me? Do you know who you're talking to? You will regret it all your life. It's the question oi the Council's image. Dont interfere. Many CMs came and went. It's not too long before the Parliament elections. What it the councils disallow you from entering these streets... If you dont have the post, you cant do with your clean image... isnt it? What do you want? I want those two dead? Fine, kill them. But not in front of everyone. Do it secretly. And I wont say anything. Come on. I told you... ...l wield the power oi Lord Shiva's third eye. Every time I use it, there will be destruction. Baby, why are you hiding at the back? Come in front. Come meet me. Won't you give your brother-in-law a hug? Come on. I told you... the day I get my hands on you.. ..l will skin you alive. Rangeela... ...I've prepared the furnace for you. At 2000 degrees. It will melt all your bones. I've endured much more in these last 10 years. Fine, then you can endure a little more. - Chhotey. - Yes, brother. Shoot the girl. Which one? You will shoot my only sister-in-law, you fool! Shoot Mrs. Rangeela rst. Come on. Get back. Come on. Stand up. Chhotey! Our armys here, bro. Run! Couldn't you have come earlier? Give me the gun. Gulab Singh, why arent you shooting? I dont know which way should I shoot? This way or that way? Billoo wont spare us. You think Billoo will be spared alive? Theres very little chance of him surviving. Sir... l say... lets get out from the back. Or your kids could be widowed too. Guddu, their numbers increasing. Climb up and shoot them. Go. You two hide at the back. Billoo! Guddu! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Guddu, careful. Guddu. Guddu. Are you okay? Slowly. If you hold me so tight... ...l will seriously really die. Brother, take a look.. Have I lost a lot of blood? Hey, stop- Where are you coming from? - Gulab Singh? - Yes. Recognize us? Guddu Rangeela. Let me search you. What's this? Hocus-pocus. . Talisman. Condom. Witchcraft in one pocket. "and condom in the other." I didnt understand this, Guddu. This isnt so difficult that you didnt understand. Ghosts and wives are unpredictable. You can run into them anywhere. What a great man. Condom in one pocket and witchcraft in the other.
