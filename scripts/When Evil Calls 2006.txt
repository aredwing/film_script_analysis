What kind of fucking stupid name is that? I didn't mean to scare you. Calm down, cool your boots. It's all right. Don't be scared, I'm not gonna hurt ya. Those... bullies chased you down here, didn't they? Come in. I don't bite... much. I'll bet you wish that you were popular, don't you, Gugenheim? Yeah. I used to as a kid. Let me tell you, it's not all that it's actually cracked up to be. Don't actually believe me, do you, Gugenheim? Let me tell you something that's absolutely fucking true. You see, because for 20 long, hard, arduous years, I tidied up after you little fucking snot rags! And boy, oh, boy, have I fucking seen some things around here, mate. Oh, yes. Nothing quite as strange as that little Samantha Neil. Oh, yeah. Maybe then, Gugenheim, you wouldn't be in such a hurry to be popular. I suppose it started on a day like... any other day, really. Hey, I was looking for you everywhere. Why didn't you wait for me? You go on ahead. Daniel! Who the hell are you? You're the Headmaster's daughter. Freak. I wish I was popular. Who's that? You want a balloon? Gimme, gimme. I wish to be popular. At any cost? You don't believe me, do you, you little shit? Oh, Samantha. Well, what happened to Samantha was that she set in motion a sequence of events that would... change everything that she believed in, with the power... of a tiny little wish. Cheers. It was the very next day... Hey, you all right? Maybe with a bit of make-up, you can look really hot. Be careful with that. If you spill it on your skin, it will burn it right off. You are pretty. Pretty fucking ugly! Help me. Wait. We need some help! Miss! Now that's what I call a bad trip. See, well, I'm sorry, I was playing words... bad trip, trip bad, acid bad, trip bad, bad. You know what? Fucking forget it. It's all right. Anyway, now, that's not the end. Now, Victoria we'll get back to later on. Well, you see, the next person to... get the text was Neville. Now, Neville... he was covered all over his face by these spots and boils the size of fucking marbles. Every time he'd smile, which was very rare, one would burst. It was fucking disgusting. Disgusting! Now let me tell you. Hey, Samantha. Hey, Sam. It's Sam. Hello, Pizza Boy. Looks like some of your cheese is melting. Did anyone order a margarita? You just bought yourself a detention, Miss. Usual time, usual place. You're dead meat, crater face. No, please! Please! Ah, shit! It looked like those rats had a little tale of their own to tell. Rats, tail, you see. For fuck's sake, will you just climb into... into the spirit of things? Fucking hard work, do you know that? Where was I? Oh yeah, Kirsty. That Kirsty was a... really nasty piece of work. Neville, of course, was a little boy she used to bully. Now, there was this little fleshy fat, fat, fat, funky chunker. He was just dying to lose some weight. Oh, you're gonna get the "dying" pun once I've told you the story. It's not fucking rocket science. Use your imagination, for fuck's sake. Fat Boy. Hey, darling. When's the last time you saw your dick in the shower? I'll join you. I'm hungry. Now, that is one fatty who is now a little flatty. It's lovely, that is. Oh, yeah. Where was I? Now, it was about this time that Detective Ringwald turned up on the scene. Cheers. You're so sexy. Good morning, sir. How are you today? Good. I've arranged to meet the Headmaster, sir. The Headmaster. All right. Hello, I'm Detective Nelson. Detective. This is the Headmaster. Headmaster, this is Detective Ringwald. Detective. He says something is very wrong here. Surely he doesn't... Surely you don't suspect foul play? There's nothing going on here in the school that we can't handle in house. Now, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me... I must get on. What does that mean? Thank you for your time. Nutter. Yo, Molly? Shut up, Molly. Come here, you. What are you doing, kissing my Molly? Come here, you. You fucking asshole. You kissing my girl, yeah? You see, Kenny... just wasn't woman enough for Molly. Now, see, I think her heart belonged to Kirsty. Now, if the thought of those young student hot bodies gets you all hot under the collar, you wait until the next story. It's gonna have you... dribbling. Shouldn't you be in class? Right! Headmaster's office! Come on! Outrageous! Look at me when I'm talking to you, Martin. You can't just go screaming at Mr. Dale, you know. He gets very upset. He's actually a rather sensitive man. Aren't you, Mike? So, are you going to tell me what this is all about? I can wait. Here's your father. Perhaps you'd like to tell him. Martin. All was laid bare in that tale. I mean Martin was one kid... who learned the naked truth. You got to be very careful with your wishes. Charlie. Now, Charlie wanted to cheat in his exams. The thing that you can't cheat... is death. Ross. Let me copy you. Mr. Parker, I'm watching you. Pathogens and disease, I forgot to revise that. The best I'll be able to get is a B. My parents will kill me. I can't get a B. It's unfeasible. Hold on. It's my fault. I made the wish. I asked to see into his brain. Quoi? Quoi? How is it your fault, son? He's just suffering from shock, that's all. Now, that's really got to hurt. Oh, yeah, remember... Victoria? Well, now. Victoria got offered a wish she could hardly refuse. I wish... I was beautiful. You're beautiful to me. Mrs. Hooper! You forgot your bag. Now, Detective. I'm not an expert at jigsaw puzzles. Can you give me a hand? ...ad Dominum et Spiritus santi. She is at peace now. She looks so beautiful. She does. Now Victoria really is drop-dead gorgeous. Dead gorgeous. See what I did there? Now, of course, then there was Hilary, who also wasn't very happy with the way that she looked. But her... chances of survival are very slender, as her weight is about to be slashed due to the very real danger of dieting. Looks like that Hilary gave her right arm to lose some weight. That bitch was really... cut down to size, wasn't she? Oh, I'm sorry. Are you feeling a bit peckish? Would you like a sandwich? Don't be shy. Tuck in, there you go. Tuck in. Oh, you're enjoying that, aren't you? Yeah, well I got another tale... for you to chew on. Good day, sir. I gotcha. There we go. Nice to see you looking well. Okay. This way. Close the school, eh? Yes, sir, yes. Are you insane? That kind of publicit could ruin a place like this, you know? And on what grounds, raison, do you expect me to do it? What? What grounds? Look! Look! Yes, I can read. That's just pure clumsiness. Students, let me tell you, are always killing themselves these days. It's good for their health, keeps the numbers down. All right, all right. That's a wrap. Okay. He said, "Have a nice day." Au revoirl Tell him. Molly, Molly, Molly. You look good enough to eat. I wish I looked good enough to eat. You look good enough to eat. If I ate shit. What are you doing? I think... At this point, I really don't see the need to overreact. Ferme ta gueulel Get to class. Move! See, school dinners have never been so attractive. But then again, you see, there was Alice. Now, Alice is not someone I'd describe as being particularly good-looking. In fact, Gugenheim, she was fucking ugly. But her boyfriend thought that bigger was gonna be better. So he decided... on some rather drastic surgery. Oh, my God. I wish my girlfriend had massive breasts. You know, like massive breasts. What, like mine? Oh, hiya, um... Watcha doing? Just talking about you, actually. Yeah? What are you talking about? Nothing. Fine, whatever. Can anyone tell me how to calculate the surface area of a circle? Anyone? We have been over this many times. I don't know why you have a problem with this. (2pi)r. It's not difficult. We've done this many times. This is very basic, and you should know this by now. It's very boring. Sit up, please sit up. If we increase surface area of the circle by 4, the diameter doubles. It doesn't increase by 4. It's not good enough that you don't know this. It's really not good enough. Does someone want to get the nurse? Lovely. It looks like Alice's boyfriend... you're gonna love this... got more than he bra-gained for. Fuckin' boom... boom... bargained for! Fuck, you know? I'm on fire. Really, I'm on fire. I'm on fire. Anyway... Clear the sinuses. Samantha... oh, no, she was doing fine. She was doing absolutely fine. In fact... that very night was the night she introduced Daniel to her parents. Daniel. Can I just say how... surprised I am to see you here today? To be honest, we don't usually see Samantha with... friends. Do we? You're kidding me. Samantha's the most popular girl in school. So, what have you two been up to today, then? Hey, I got a text today offering me a wish. Samantha. Sorry, Dad. Sounds terribly exciting. And can I just guess what it is you wished for? I wished that my stepdad wasn't dead. He passed away last year. I'll get it. Who is it at the door? It's no one. Are you all right, Samantha? I'm good. Is Daniel home? Do we have some plastic bags and a saw? I'm not being funny, but talk about a visit... from beyond the gravy. Anyway, you know. Daniel's father was a fucking rotten parent. In fact, he was practically... practically decomposing. From one roast to another. You really want to be hot? Try this. Watch out! Made... wish. Came... true. Hey. A party this weekend. You will be there, won't you? Lt'll be a total flop without you there. It seems to me that the detective was beginning to catch on. There was something about Linda's burning that ignited something in the booze-rattled brain of Ringwald. Where was I? Oh, yeah. That's right. I'm back in the library. Now. Sally thought that Mark only had eyes for her. But what I think is she was about to stop seeing him... permanently. ...than you do with Mrs. Snuggles? No, I love you more. Oh, I really love you. Oh, I love you, too. No, I love you more. I love you more. Mark! I think he loves me more. You know, I've done you a favor. If I could have one wish, it would be that I never had to see you again! Linda. Linda. I'll bet she didn't see that one coming. And the school was in absolute chaos. The clown's terror-iffic reign of despair continued. But Detective Ringwald was on the case. An important lead was about to open his eyes to Samantha's part in this fright-mare. Yet, well, you know, I'm not the best sort at puns in the world, but I'm actually trying my fucking hardest. Sorry. Got something else better you can do? Well, go back outside and get the fucking shit kicked out of you? No! I thought not. Shut your mouth, and you might fucking learn something! Now, where was I? Oh, yeah. Okay! Here, here, here! Ah, oui. Ah, oui, oui, oui, oui, ouil "It is common practice in the 21st Century "for evil djinnis to use such devices as mobile phones and emails to cause their mischief." "The initial wisher, or summoner, as they are better known, "is granted their wish... money, power, fame, et cetera... "in return for forwarding the djinni onwards, "through chain letters, or text messages, "where they can wreak their mayhem. "The only way to stop the djinni is to get the initial wisher "to retract their wish, and return themselves to the state they were previously." A text message that is killing people. Yes! Don't you think that's just a little bit far-fetched? Just a little bit far-fetched? I just wished... people could see... how beautiful I was on the inside. - Oh, God. - Jesus Christ. Well, it appears that beauty is only skin-deep. I want to be fair. I mean, it took a lot of guts to make a wish like that, didn't it? Now, moving on swiftly to a different type of crush: The teenage crush. That age-old die-lemma. This is bloody disgraceful! Fail! Jennifer! And a fail for you, too. And don't you dare chew gum in my class again, young lady. This is abysmal! I waste my entire weekend marking this drivel. Will you spell drivel for me, Linnet? I doubt it. No, silly me. You're only taking English "A" level in three months' time. Why should you be able to spell? You can't bloody write English. Half of you can hardly speak the language! Well, I tell you, I'm bloody furious. It's not funny! None of this is funny! Mr. Dale. I wondered if I could talk to you a little. You see, I seem to be having some problems with verb positioning? I just don't seem to know where to put it... in front, or... behind? Now, Carol, please. We've been through this. While you're a pupil of mine, you remain very much a child to me. And I would appreciate it if you started behaving like one. Really. Mike. Ah, Miss Nibb. A spot of human biology? Oh, yes. Oh, yes! I wish I was old now. Who's there? Carol, is that you? Please help me! Please help me! Now, this young girl made a pass on Mr. Dale... Naughty, naughty... but ended up needing a pass of her own. A bus pass, that is. As for Samantha, poor love, you know her nightmare was just beginning. So hold on to your trousers 'cause it's full scream ahead... for my next tale. No! I have to stop this. I've got to call the police and tell them what I've done. Do I really want to go back to being the person I was? Hello? Daniel. What are you doing calling at this time? Yeah. Same here. Yes, I wish come true for me. Okay, I guess I've got to run. My parents will be wondering who's calling me in the middle of the night. Yeah. See you. You'll have to be strong. It's too late. You can never go back! Seems to me like Samantha's a little clown on her luck. I mean, is this freakish, funny man going to have the last laugh, or... will Samantha seize the day? Meanwhile, Molly and Kirsty are just beginning to get close. I mean, is there anything that can tear these star-crossed lovers apart? I wonder. I wish me and Molly were together until we die. Hello. I'm sorry. I think these two girls found out that love... love can be a right fucking pain in the neck. You see, but... an eternity or two together will probably be the death of their relationship. Now, here's another twist in an already twisted tale. Linda, you see, of course, can't actually see anything. But her "eye-fright" is about to improve, of course, because her boyfriend is like, lookin' out for her. Don't blink... or you'll miss it. See you tomorrow. Well, I certainly won't be seeing you. Good morning. I can see. You okay? You've got one last wish to make. Don't make me go back to being a geek. No. He says you've got to read out the passage. There you go. Can't believe we're doing this. That's it? I think that her eyes were bigger than her stomach. What's that? You want to go to the loo? You're having a fucking Turkey shot. You sit down. I'm nearly finished my story. Sit down. Samantha... Well, she's got to face up to her fears, stop clowning about. So pop your ass in a pew and pay attention. I'm nearly done. Hello! Please! Yes, yes. What? Who? Now? Yes! A big hand for the most popular boy and girl in the school! Yes, the couple you voted this year's Prom King and Queen. Well done. No! Do you really want to go back to being the person you were? Do you really want to go back to being... unpopular? Hmm? I wish... I had never met you! - Hey. - Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? You. What are you doing here? What are you doing in my room? Job done. Au revoir, poulette. Freak. What? Ahem. There you go, kid. That's my story. Careful what you wish for, as they say. Fuckin' hell. Right. Well, I guess those kids outside would have gone by now, so you can... Go on. Jog on. Fuck off. Off you pop. See you. Bye.
