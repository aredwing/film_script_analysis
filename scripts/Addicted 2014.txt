It comes with the territory. Make yourself comfortable, okay? Take off your coat. Sit wherever you like. I'm glad you found the time to come and see me. I assure you that everything we talk about is completely confidential. No one sees these notes but me. Well, it's not like I'm a movie star, or anything. Why don't we just try something? Maybe you can tell me what brought you here. You know, would that be easier for you? Um, okay. Well, it started the moment that, um, I realized that all the good things in my life could never fill this void that's always been there. I have the perfect life. Wonderful home. Best family anyone could hope for. Show it to Granny. My kids are the light of my life. They're funny... Go! ...and bright and just delicious, you know. A soldier holding a baby kangaroo... What? No! You're, like... Okay. Hold this thought. What else? Gimme something else. Up high. It's a torch! It's a... Uh, Statue of Liberty! Yay! Oh, my God! How did he get that? Whoo-hoo! Okay, now you. My momma's the kind of woman whose hug could turn a dark day bright. My husband Jason is every woman's dream. He's my first love and my soul mate. Oh, yeah. Yeah! It was so good, baby. You wanna go for Round 3? Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Wanna do something special. Do you? Mmm. Yeah. That feels so good. I love you. Really? Mmm-hmm. Good morning, Zoe. Would you like a tracking number, so you can give them a call? Good morning, boss. Good morning, Shane. You look absolutely dazzling, as usual. Thank you. Can you tell Brina to come see me when she gets in? Mmm-hmm. Brina is here. Brina is always here. Brina lives here. Hmm. Maybe I should charge you for rent. Maybe you should start paying me more. Maybe I should. - Maybe you can't afford it. - Maybe I'll do it anyhow. Maybe I won't let you. Hey! I'm the boss. And I'm here to keep you being the boss. You try to pay me more, and I'll quit. Okay, I'm confused. All right. Down to business. Quinton Canosa... Quinton Canosa exhibit. I need... A catalog of his art. And also... His bio, references, history... And finally... Nope, can't get that. What? His photo. He doesn't let people take his photo. I was gonna say "croissant," but thanks for the info. So, wait, this guy still doesn't have a rep? Amazing. I know. Well, he's all about the art. "Quinton Canosa, the people's artist. " Mmm-hmm. He's amazing. Yeah. You know, every piece just grabs you, you know, in the gut. We could license his work and introduce him to a whole new world of revenue. Okay. "Revenue" is a good word. Do your thing, girl. Go get that revenue. Ooh! And once that happens, we need to reinstate mani-pedi Fridays. Uh, excuse me. Do you like it? Like it? I... I love it. Yeah. Quinton Canosa's an incredible talent. Huh. If you say so. Do you know anything about art? That what you call it? Okay, uh... Quinton Canosa's genius, okay? He's one of the greatest artists of our time. If you can't see that, I don't know what you're doing here. Nice work, Quinton. Really nice. Appreciate it. Lovely lady as well. No, no, no... You? You... You're Quinton Canosa? I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. Okay. Yeah, you got me. I feel like such a fool. No, no. Please don't. Well, just a little bit. I'm so embarrassed. I'm just kidding. Oh, I don't speak Spanish. Oh, you don't? Um, I was saying, it, uh... It's a pleasure to meet you. It's an honor to meet you, Quinton. Yeah. I didn't catch your name, Ms... Oh. It's Mrs. Zoe Reynard. Oh. Oh, Mrs. Yeah. I see. God, that always happens, right? The good ones, they're always taken. Oh... Oh, thank you. Uh... I think he's my favorite. Really? That's mine. Uh, I don't know if this is the right place or time to talk business? Well, if it's the only way to keep you next to me... Um... Oh, well, uh... Um, business? What? You were gonna talk about business. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, I have a company and, uh, we represent contemporary artists. Oh, wow. That's nice. Yeah. Okay, can you tell me about it? Oh. Yeah, okay, uh... We would license your work to the highest bidder, you know, it could be a classy advertising campaign, or, um, you know, inspiration for a clothing line. I mean, you are an incredible artist, solely, but we would expand on that artistry into a brand. That's nice. Can you explain that to me again, please? Oh, I'm sorry. Spanish... Am I talking too fast? I just love to watch the way your lips move. Um, so, you know, if you're interested, uh, my office could contact you and set up a meeting. Okay, um... I don't think... Uh, you know what? Honestly, I don't like to be so formal. Besides, you already know I'm interested. So let's do something. Monday morning. 9:00. Come to my studio. Oh! Great. Pleasure to meet you... Zoe. Oh, can I call you "Zoe"? Call me Zoe. Okay. Meeting Quinton Canosa just made me realize how much I missed excitement in my life. And did you act out on that feeling? I sure did. I tried to relive it with Jason. And? And nothing. Hello? Hey, handsome. Are you on your way? Oh, sweetie. This is gonna be one of those long nights. I gotta finish the plans for the civic center by the weekend and I'm way behind. We didn't have any plans tonight, did we? Guess not. Um, hurry home, okay? I'll try my best. But don't wait up, all right? And kiss the kids for me. Okay. I will. Love you. Our love is forever. Always has been. Always will be. All right. Sweet dreams. Oh, hi, Momma. Um, I'm going to the store. Do you need anything? Hmm. You are definitely going to be the best-dressed lady in the produce department. Well, I got dressed up for Jason. I'll see you in a minute. Thank you. Mmm. Excuse me. Hello? Oh. Hi, Mom. Hey, you still at the store? Um, I'm in the parking lot. I'm just leaving. Can I get you something? Oh, I don't want you to have to go back in. You're probably ready to hop into bed. Is that music I hear in the parking lot? Oh, someone's just blasting their stereo. Um... What is it? I don't mind. I'm already here. I could sure use some ice cream. I mean, uh... That cookie dough flavor, if they have it. Cookie dough ice cream, coming right up. You sure? Yes, I'm sure, Mom. I'll be right there. Holy shit. Mmm. Oh! Oh, hi. Just got home. Mmm. I couldn't wait to make it up to you for missing dinner. I'm sorry. Mmm. Well, I forgive you. I love you. I love you, too. You look so beautiful when you sleep. Mommy! Wake up, sleepyhead! Oh... Lucky me. My own personal wake-up call. You must be hungry. Come on. Let me make you some breakfast. Dad's already made breakfast. He did? He made breakfast? Yeah. Well, let me go see. I'm so excited. Good morning! Good morning! Hey, sleepyhead! Hi! Good morning! Good morning. Here we go. For my beautiful wife. There you go. It's hot. Oh. Oh! It is hot. Um... Well, I have to get the kids to... I'll take 'em today. You just enjoy your breakfast. Don't forget this. Thank you. Good morning, Mom. You got up late. Mmm. Good morning, big boy. Okay, guys. Ready for school? Nope. Ha-ha! Very funny. Let's go. Where's your backpack? We love school! Yes, we do. No, we don't. Have a good day. I love you. Our love is forever. Always has been. Always will be. I was watching the love of my life take our beautiful children to school and all I could think about was what I was still missing. It's so strange, you know, to love someone so much, and still have it never be enough. Uh, physically. So did you feel this way in other relationships before you got married? Well, I wouldn't know. I never had any. Jason is the first person you'd ever been with, until recently? Yes. We were high school sweethearts. We had our first child a few years later. And the rest is history. Do you feel that changed your relationship with Jason? Yes. It made us parents. It's just that I, you know, always needed something more in my life. Well, you know, Zoe, with kids, intimacy changes. Sometimes you gotta make time for it. Yeah. Not really. Look, we have sex two or three times a day sometimes. And I'm still not satisfied. And if I keep telling him that I want more, he's gonna think I'm a complete freak. From everything you say, it sounds like you and Jason have a very strong relationship. I should've talked to him more. I should've done a lot of things, but, instead... Instead, you what? I took my first step down a terrible path. Hello? Hello? Hello? Zoe? Did I scare you? So you live here, too, huh? Oh, yeah. I actually do everything here. Some coffee? No, thanks. Tequila shot? No. No tequila. Uh, my husband would love your work. Really? Yeah, he has a good eye. He's an architect. Well, he's obviously a man of taste. Obviously. Por favor. Okay. So down to business. Yes. Here's what we do at Zoe & Company. Oh, let me guess. You add me to your client roster, and then you license my work to the highest bidder, and then my stuff ends up on every calendar, every coffee mug, lunch box... I don't know. Just pretty much everywhere. - You think I'm that crass? - Wow. Okay, maybe coffee mugs. So I believe you have a contract for me to review? Uh, yeah. Yeah. You can go over that with your attorney and do all your research about us, or whatever... Oh, don't worry. I, uh... I have done all the research I need. Yeah. Uh... That's it? That's it. Signed, sealed, delivered. The one and only Quinton Canosa is my new client? Okay. I'm all yours. I better go. Zoe... You, uh... You're not the first person to ask me to do the whole commercial art thing. I've turned down everyone before. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. You wanna know why I chose you? Why? I wanna ask you for something in return. I want to paint you. Well, I'm flattered, but, uh... Let me think about that one. Okay, so, I will let my office formalize our deal and get back to you. I want to paint you and put you over my bed. So that when you're not here, I can satisfy myself with the mere thought of you. Uh, I'm flattered, but... I really am. But I can't. I'm married. So... How do you open this damn door? Relax. I know you want it. I can feel it. I know you want it. I can't... This isn't right. It's not right. Come on, Zoe. Nothing's ever felt so right. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, yes! Boss? Excuse me? I was buzzing you. There's a guy named Balthazar Crayne on 2. Um... Take a message. You sure? This guy doesn't sound like he's used to being kept waiting. Take a message. Got it. Excuse me, boss. Excuse me. Oh, I have this. Boss? Can you hang on a sec? I'll be right back. Alfred Conteh is freaking over the coffee mugs. Yeah, I can't deal with him right now. You all right? I'm not feeling well. So I'll be home and just, um, forward me anything that's urgent. Is Balthazar Crayne urgent? His office just called a third time. Oh. Well, what's the problem? Balthazar Crayne! This Balthazar Crayne! He could change our lives. Take this place to the next level. He saw our website. Well, how do you know this guy? Well, his No. 2 man's assistant is my sister's best friend from high school. She introduced me to a guy who works for his accountant. One drink led to another, I sent him our website, and now the Balthazar Crayne is calling you. Nice work. No. "Nice work" is when I introduce you to an up-and-coming artist. This is "Brina, you are the most freaking amazing person in the world" level work. So you go back in your office and you call him. I'll be home, okay? Just tell him that I'll take him to dinner tomorrow night. And, um, we'll discuss it then. And just make it someplace expensive. I pull this off and you owe me something big. Bentley big! Just please handle it. Mom? Mom? You're home? Hi, sweetie. I thought you couldn't come to the game because you were working? We saw your car in the driveway. You okay? Uh, bad headache. Look, I wasn't feeling well, sweetie. So I came home early, okay? But I promise I will be there at the next one. Okay, sweetie? I promise. Okay. You have to come. It's the last game of the season. You have my word. Got it? Uh, why don't you let Grandma go get you a snack and go finish your homework? Okay. Are you sure you're okay? Uh, yeah. You know, maybe it was the kids' flu from last week. I don't know. I just took some medicine. Okay. I'll be down there in a sec. No, no, no. Rest. I'll get him started on homework and get Kayla from piano. Okay. Thanks, Mom. Love you. Love you, too. Okay. Here is the restaurant address and directions. Balthazar will meet you there tonight at 7:00 sharp. I had to sell one of my kidneys to get a reservation, so don't be late. Hey! Zoe. We need this. I know. Shane, can you get me a courier? Sure. Actually, uh... Never mind. I'll deal with it. Hey. Are you looking for Quinton? Um... He's not home. Left about an hour ago. Oh. Okay. Is there something you wanna leave for him? You can leave it with me, Zoe. Uh... No. How do you know my name? Quinton told me all about you. He was right. You're very beautiful. Thank you. That's very nice. I'm Diamond, by the way. Nice to meet you. Bit of advice, be careful. Quinton's an artist. He's very... Sensitive. Uh... Okay. Zoe? Zoe! What... What's going on? Are you... Look, I can't... You all right? I can't do it. What do you mean? I can't. I'm sorry. It's not that I don't want to. Some part of me... I'd be lying if I said that. But my family, my kids, my husband... Look, I... I never want to force you into something you don't want to do. Okay. Thank you. "Thank you"? Just like that, thank you? All right. Thank you for understanding. Yeah, yeah. Just come here. Mmm-mmm-mmm. No, no, no. Stop. Please. I can't. I'll make you a deal. Just give me an hour. What? I wanna show you something. I wanna show you something special. I bet you do. I'm not talking about that. It's just, um, some art. After that, you can go home if you want to. One hour. Okay, one hour. Promise. Just one condition. Condition? Turn around for me. Turn... Yes, turn around for me. Come on. No. Come on. Quinton... Relax. Quinton... Just relax. Where are we going? Trust me. Come here. Watch your head. Careful. Quinton, where are we? I want your first look to be perfect. Hmm? My first look at what? Enough. What is it? It's beautiful. I started it when I was 11. And I've never shown this to anyone before. Well, is, um, that you and your family? No, no. That's the family I wanted. When I was nine years old, my mom... She ran off with another man. We never saw her again. I'm so sorry. Broke my father's heart. He took a gun, put it in his mouth. Oh, my God. I know... I know things happen in a marriage, but for a mother to just leave her child and never look back, that's... I can never get over that. Oh, Quinton... I know this is all wrong. I know I'm not supposed to... To be with another man's wife, but... Zoe, I can't help it. Thanks, Mr. Crayne. Balthazar! Mr. Crayne! Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Hi. I'm Zoe. I am so sorry. Please don't go. Look, I would completely understand if you were furious with me for being so rude and didn't wanna have anything to do with me, but please hear me out. I am always on time. But my daughter Kayla was sick tonight and I took her to the doctor, and I just lost track of time. I apologize. I'm on a red-eye to Paris. And you should call my office to reschedule. Thank you for understanding. I hope your daughter feels better. Have a safe trip. I totally lost track of time when I was with Quinton. I keep using my kid as an excuse. I said my daughter was sick. God, you don't wanna put that out in the universe. This is making me crazy. I'm... I'm so messed up. And this obsession... I know, I know that it's ruining my life. It's terrible. But I keep going back. So how long have you been meeting him now? Oh, months. Every day, if I can. Oh, God! Oh. Well, thank you so much, uh, but I, uh... I better hurry. If I hurry, I can actually get the kids to bed. First time since Monday night. Zoe... Let's make some time for next week. Yeah, it's just that, you know... I have to see if I have, well, the time. You know, with the kids and work and Jason... See, coming here is just one more thing that I have to hide. When can I see it? When it's finished. When will it be finished? You don't like waiting for anything, do you? I thought that's what you liked about me. You know what? Um... Your chin... No, no... Just hold on. Zoe, Zoe... Come here. Let me see. Come here. There you go. Just hold it. There. Okay... Zoe, what are you doing? You're a model. Models keep still. Okay? What are you doing? You're not helping me here. I don't like following orders. Zoe... Quinton? That would be cheating. Curiosity killed the cat. Who are they? Some women I used to know. This one... It's so disturbing. Well, I, um... I paint what I feel. She's still stunning. They're all so beautiful. Are you jealous? No. I... I have no right to be. Zoe, come on. It's so funny. It's so funny. This is crazy. What the hell am I doing here? What are you doing here? I mean... I think we both know the answer to that one. Yeah, do we? Hmm? Yeah, we... We know the answer? Yeah, we do. Are you sure I'm not just another one of your women that you've lured into your lair? What's wrong with you? Zoe, come on. They're just paintings from a long time ago, I told you. Come on. I better go. Are you serious? I don't belong here. You do... You belong here, Zoe. You know that. Don't say that. 'Cause nobody... Nobody has ever made me feel this way. Talk this way. Seen my soul. Okay, trap it. First, trap it. Don't plant your foot too early. Mommy! Put it right next to the ball, look. Hey, honey! How'd it go? They won! They did? Oh, you should have seen him! Saved the day. Oh, wow! Our star player! Congratulations! That's right. You promised! Um... Hey, hey, hey, hey! Peter, I'm sorry. I had to work. What happened? Uh... Client crisis. Hey, how's my best girl? Momma's a Smurf! Look! You've got blue hair! Hmm. Oh! How'd that get there? Occupational hazard, huh? Can I get blue hair, too? Please? Come on, stop yanking on your momma. Come on. Come here, silly banana. Have some hot chocolate. Sit down. You want some? Yeah, thank you. Hey. I'm sorry. All right? Careful. Look at you. Messy Bessie. Here. I was gonna tell him. Swear to God. Good? I just couldn't. It would destroy my family, my life. I'm sick. I'm really sick. Zoe, this is an obvious sign of addiction here. Addiction? I'm not on drugs. No, you can't smoke it, shoot it, or snort it. But make no mistake, sex can be a drug, too. It's as powerful as any narcotic. Oh, come on. That's crazy. No, sexual addiction, it's not as common as alcoholism or drugs. But it is a very real problem that thousands of people are battling each day. Your first time with a lover outside of your marriage is like your first hit of heroin. The thrill of the illicit. Then you keep craving it. Okay. Well, then what do I do? Because I come here to see you, and we talk and we talk, and we talk. But what's the solution? I need help! What's the plan? Now, you said that you tried talking to Jason before. I think that you should suggest to him couples counseling. Then he'll know there's a real problem in your marriage. Okay. I'll give it a shot. I didn't know you got a new cell phone. Oh. Uh... Crayne, Balthazar Crayne, you know, that investor guy. One of his companies sells them and they gave them out as promos. That's pretty snazzy. Oops. Oh. Here, I'll take it. That's okay. I think that's your new millionaire boyfriend calling. Oh, please. Yeah. That's all I need in my life. Another man. You are all the man that I need. Really? Mmm-hmm. Mmm. What's on your mind, baby? Hmm? Uh... Yeah, you know, actually, there is a problem that we should talk about. A problem? Mmm-hmm. What's the problem? Maybe you and I should talk to somebody. Talk to who? About what? Uh, a professional, about our... Our sex life. What's wrong... What's wrong with our sex life? Wait, hold on. What do you mean by "a professional"? You know, a therapist. I'm not gonna talk to a shrink about anything. Especially not our personal affairs. Half of those people are crooks. That's ridiculous. No, no. Ridiculous is the money they spend on some fake doctor to listen to their problems. Wow. I didn't know you hated an entire profession. Look, sweetie, we have always talked about everything, right? Why would we need to bring somebody in, a total stranger, and have them get in between us? Hmm? Jason, why aren't you listening to me? I mean, I think that... You know, maybe... Listen to you, listen to you. ... it would be a good... Come here, sweetie. You're exhausted. You work too hard. All right, we both do. Tell you what. Why don't we go to that French place on Saturday? The one you like. With the candles. Have some wine, hmm? Mmm. Yes. Um... I need to take a walk. Okay, that's a good idea. Get some fresh air. I'll finish up. Our love is forever. Always has been. Always will be. Wow. Quinton, that was great. I needed that. Yeah, yeah, me, too. Mmm... You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. Actually... Actually, I'm not okay. I'm not okay. I, uh... I think we need to talk. Talk about what? About us. About the whole thing. I mean, it has been great and everything, but... But what? Leave him. Leave your husband and be with me. I can't. You can't? Why the hell not? I can't. I can't leave Jason. Tell me, tell me why not. Tell me. I wanna know. Because Jason's my life. Yeah, and that's why you're here with me every chance you get? Oh, Quinton, come on, you knew that I was married when we met. What'd you expect? I didn't expect anything. I don't know what to expect. I didn't expect to fall in love with you and I did! And I know you've thought about it. I look at you and I see it. I feel it. It's more than just sex to you, too. I can't! I have two kids! I have a family. I can't. I want to have a family, too. With you. He changed the rules on me. He wasn't supposed to do that. He changed the rules? Okay. We both did. Hmm. But, I mean, Jason wasn't listening. Damn, Quinton was right. I could picture myself with him. How does that make you feel, Zoe? Like I was cheating with my heart. Which is not what I signed on for. This is not what I need. What do you need? Oh, yeah? You want it in? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Come on. Yeah, you like that? Huh? My name is Corey. Mmm. I've never done it like that before. I enjoyed every minute of it. Is there medication? You know, some kind of pill that you can prescribe? Oh, Lord. I even sound like an addict. You know that we never really got a chance to talk about your childhood in Dallas, before you moved to Atlanta. Oh, I don't remember any of that. You were 10 years old when you moved, right? I'm telling you, I don't remember anything. Jason teases me about it. He says it's because my life began when I met him. So when'd you get that scar? Was that before Atlanta? Uh... God, I've always had this. Why? What does it matter? Because, Zoe, the past can help us understand the present. So we really do need to explore every avenue, in order to help make you well. Oh. I gotta go. Listen, I will try to remember more, for next week. I do wanna get better. And you will. Oh! You like that? Oh, God, yes. What do you like about it? Everything. Zoe? Zoe? Come in. Zoe... You all right? Um... Oh, there's just something going around at the kids' school. What's up? We need to go over the numbers for this quarter, and they are not good. Here... Quinton? Hmm. Little busy. Just leave it at the beep. Hey, it's me. I see your car downstairs, but I don't see you. Where are you? Oh, shit! Hey, you wanna join us? What's wrong with her? Zoe, listen to me. Don't touch me, you pig! Can we talk it over, please? Why don't you talk it over with your little trick over there, huh? Bitch! I don't even know what's going on with you two. I don't wanna know. I mean, you can stay and watch if you want. Zoe, I know it's fucked up, but, please... This whole thing is fucked up! This whole thing is fucked up! Yeah, you know what? You're absolutely right! It's fucked up completely! 'Cause you get to go to your husband every night. And what? What do you expect me to do, Zoe? Just wait here for you? Is that what... Is that what you want me to do? Zoe, I'm talking to you! What do you want me to do? Come here, Zoe. Listen, Zoe. Zoe, I asked you to be with me. I asked you. What do you want me to do? Tell me. Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it. What do you want? What the fuck did you want from me? Nothing. I don't want a damn thing. Hi, baby. What's wrong? You okay? What's going on? Just... Bad day. Hey, you know if you're in trouble, you can always stay here. I feel we have a connection. Hmm. So you know I got your back, right? I'll take care of you. I'm okay. Just fuck me. Oh, that's what you want, huh? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, you like that. Oh, yeah. Slide back, baby. Let me get up there and do that for you. I'll give it to you all day. Choke me. You like that? You like it, don't you? Yeah. Good night, Mommy. Good night, sweetie. Okay. Good night, Mom. Good night. I think I'm a little too old to be tucked in. Okay. Momma, I'll be back. Oh, yeah. Yes! Uh-huh. Open up. There you go. Yeah! Harder. You try it. No. Go ahead. Are you sure? Yeah, baby, just do it. Ah! Don't stop. You've missed every single soccer game. Kayla's asking where you go at night. I tried explaining to her, but I couldn't. So, maybe you can explain it to me. Why? You're the only person allowed to work late? I work. I don't disappear. Do you know how many nights that I've stayed up waiting up for you? Oh, I'm in my office. I answer your calls. You always know where I am. I don't know anything. I don't know what you do at work. I don't know who you talk to. I don't know what you're doing with them. I mean, I work, too, Jason. I mean, what? My work's not as important, because I don't make as much money as you? Okay, stop it! This is about the kids. Is it? No, I think this is about us. I think we should talk about what's missing. What's missing? Okay, let me see. We got a beautiful home, beautiful kids, we got great careers. What the hell else do you want? Yeah, everything's perfect. Look, I want you. I want more from you. I mean, I want you to loosen up. You know? If you just loosened up, and I could... I could take us to places that is just... That's just so amazing. Hmm? I mean, you know, we could try new things... Experiment. You know? Okay, who the hell are you? I'm your wife! No, no, no, no... My wife tells me when something is wrong. I tried. My wife... My wife tells me about her day, makes time for her family, and she doesn't get a fancy new cell phone and then lie about it. And what is this? Condoms? I... We never use condoms! You went through my bag? Since when do you care if I see what's in your bag? Jason, I told you that I went to the doctor. I wasn't feeling well, and so we... I got off the pill. Okay, look... You know I would do anything for you, right? Okay? I love you more than life itself. You can talk to me. Yeah, well... You could do me right here. What? Do me right here. Come on. The kids are asleep. You don't get it, do you? Okay. I want my wife back. I'm right here. What's going on? Okay... Uh, word is Preston Ellis is going over to ARC. Well, get him on the phone. I'll try and... There's more. Both Kanisha Wylie and Rob Diaz are going with him. Oh, damn it. And I think that's a letter from Alfred Conteh's lawyer on your desk. He's suddenly decided he doesn't need representation. Oh, well, forget him. He's an idiot. Is he? What? What's your problem? My problem? Oh, well, let's see. I have no life, because I work my ass off 24/7, to keep a company going for a boss who hasn't given a shit about the business for months now. And now I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna make my rent. Because my boss, who is also supposed to be my best friend, can't even see that we might not make payroll next week. How's that for a problem? I'm tapped out. We're done. Mmm-mmm, no. You don't get to give up now. You know, I came to work here because I believed in you. You were a visionary. The girl who could... Who could spot talent in a kid painting on the side of a building. If anyone can fix this, you can. But you need to act. Do what you do best. Bring in that big artist. Have that great idea. You know, this is it, Zoe. Sink or swim. It is up to you. And I will do anything you need. But do not just disappear on me. So where do I sign? I'm just kidding. I'm happy to have you back, whatever the reason is. Who is it? Oh, they're early. Hey, Quinton. Hey, man. Good to see you. Good to see you, too. Ed and Aaron are gonna meet us at the restaurant. But I don't believe you've met our chief architect, Mr. Jason Reynard. Pleasure. Mr. Jason. All right. Pleasure to meet you, man. Yeah. Since you'll be doing the mural, I wanted Jason to see your work firsthand. Yeah, no problem. Of course. Excuse me, gentlemen, I have to take this. This is Benny. Yep. Wow. You're talented. Thank you. Whoa, this is... This is... It's beautiful. It's disturbing. Disturbing... Yeah. Hmm. I love it. You know, my wife, she would love your stuff. Really? Mmm. She represents artists. Started her own agency from the ground up. Wow, that's nice. Hmm. I'm gonna get you a card for her. She's got a great eye, and she's a marketing genius. I'm sure she could make you a mint in reproductions. Jason? We should get going. Our reservations are for 6:30. All right. Let's go. Let's go celebrate and have some drinks. Well... All right. Nice. I gotta handle something real quick. Meet you guys in a few. All right. You weren't gonna stop him, were you? Here. I... I gotta go. Have a dinner with a client. I'm ready to go. Come on. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! I don't wanna miss the previews, guys. I wanna do it myself! Jesus, Kayla, okay, look, you know, the movies are gonna start with or without us, guys. I know. It's up to you. Hey, where are you guys going? Some new Disney thing at Phipps. We didn't think you'd wanna come. Course not. I wanna come. You can have my ticket. You better hurry, the movie starts in 15 minutes. Oh, great. Now we're gonna miss the movie because of you. I don't wanna miss the movie! We're not gonna miss the movie! Just put your shoe on, Kayla. Come on. No, it's fine. You guys go ahead. You sure? Yeah. Have fun. I'll make cookies for when you get back. Cookies! Yay! Cookies. Bye, Peter. All right. See you in a couple hours. Hey, Kayla, you know I'm in the front, right? Whatever. Just whatever. So how did that make you feel, being left alone? Horrible. Like I lost my family. Zoe, we need to talk about your childhood. You know what, Dr. Spencer? This is not working for me. What is it about your past that scares you so much? See, there you go again. All the same questions. No answers. You just sit there, 100 bucks an hour, and all you do is ask the same stupid questions! And nothing changes! It's okay for you to be frustrated. Or scared. But you have got to take control over your life now, before this addiction ruins it. You need to confront your lovers, call it quits and go cold turkey. And then you can begin to claim your life back. It may sound like a lot, but I promise you it will be okay. It's not okay! None of this is okay! You know what? Jason was right. People need to handle their own damn problems. Paying you to listen to me is not the solution. Then what's the solution? I need to sort this out on my own. Thank you. Zoe, you can't keep running from your past. Because sooner or later, it's gonna catch up with you. You can't keep running! What the hell? Thank you. Have a good day. You, too. What did he want? Slow down, honey. You're gonna give yourself a heart attack. Momma! What did that man want? He was a messenger. You have a package. Ugh! What is it, honey? What's the matter? It's fine. Are the kids inside? Of course. They're upstairs doing their homework. What is it? Do you wanna talk to me about something? Oh... Momma, I... It's fine. Hey, babe. Hey. What's that? It's from Quinton Canosa. Uh, the artist? Yeah. He's doing the mural for the civic center. He's the most generous guy. I went to his place, saw this, told him I loved it. He sent it over as a gift. And a note. Okay, Jason, I, um... Look, um... Here. "You told me your wife loves art, "and I hope she enjoys this as well. " Amazing. Can I even accept something like this? Honestly. Uh... What's wrong? Oh, God. I am... You know, I had bad sushi. It's heavy, too. You know? It's gotta be worth a mint. You all right? Babe. Hey. Surprise. You want a drink? Want a brandy? Maybe a... Maybe a wine for the lady? Tell me what makes you happy. Tell me what makes you smile. Tell me. Come on. What do you want? I can't see you anymore, Quinton. You can't see me anymore? Zoe, come on. Zoe... If it's because of my gift, I was just fucking around, all right? I was just playing around. I was just... No, it's not because of the stupid statue. Then what is it? What is it? Tell me, what is it? Oh, my God. Come here. Please come here. Please don't make this any harder than it has to be. Okay? Quinton. Quinton, I need you to hear me. I am listening to you. I am listening to you. Okay? Zoe? Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck am I? Who the fuck are you? I got an urgent text from her to come here. Zoe, who is this dude? Look, I'm sorry. I only wanna do this once. Do what? Wait. You fucking this guy, too? You fuck... What? Wow. Wow. It seems Ms. Zoe has been cheating not only on her husband, but on me, too. Huh? Is that right? You brought me all the way down here to confess? Is anybody else coming? I mean, I don't know. Maybe we can form a... We can form a support group, some shit like that, huh? Stop! Just stop! Look, I got you both here at the same time to tell you that it's over. This has got to stop, okay? I love my husband, I love my children, and I don't wanna see you again. So you think this is okay? You can fuck anybody you want and then it's just, what, it's goodbye? Don't you get it? I can't control myself. It doesn't matter who I screw. I'm sick. Asshole. You got a mouth on you. Listen to me! Get off me, man! Look, I got no beef with you, man. Hey, buddy. You good? He's not answering me. Oh, Zoe... You wanna know something, Zoe? You know, since I was a little boy, people would just walk away from me. Just walk out of my life. You're not gonna walk away from me. You're not gonna leave me. Don't come near me. Oh, you're scared of me now? What, my touch isn't good enough for you now? Tell me! I'm fucking asking you something! Look, let's just talk about it, okay? Just calm down. Oh, no, no, no. We're not gonna talk about shit anymore, you fucking little bitch. We're not gonna talk about anything. Do you hear me? Oh, you fucking bitch. That was not nice. That was not nice. Very fucking painful. You see... Very fucking painful, you fucking bitch. Come over here, you fucking bitch! Where are you going? Please let me go! Don't, Quinton! Think I'm gonna hurt you? I won't hurt you. You know, all I ever wanted to do, was to have some good sex with you. That's all. But you... You made me want you. You made me need you! What you looking at? Don't look at me like that. I told you to leave your fucking husband, but you wouldn't listen to me. Because you're a little selfish bitch. That's why. You know that I would never hurt you like you hurt me. I would never do that to you. I would never do that to you! Look at you. Look at you, you're so fucking beautiful. You're so beautiful. I'm gonna make sure... I'm gonna make sure your last thoughts are of me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Okay? Zoe? You can have that back. You left this on the kitchen table. Told me all I need to know. Jason? Jason, wait! This motherfucker's just crazy. What the hell happened? Jesus. Quinton... What did you do? Hey, baby... Hey... Jason, please. Please hear me out. I don't need to hear a goddamn thing. Got a pretty clear picture here. Oh, I am beyond sorry... You're sorry? Look, I know that I lied. But I'm not lying to you right now when I say that I've been seeing a doctor. And she's been helping me with my condition. That's the technical term for "screwing around on your husband"? Oh, God. Jason... I know I fucked up. I know I did. But I love you and you love me! And I think we can work it out. Yeah, let's all have therapy! It'll all be great! Look, you can't just throw away everything we... You threw it away! You screwed around! You put our kids in danger! I never cheated on you. You were my life. I'm still your life. You are a lying, cheating whore. Okay? We are done. Through. It's over. And you won't be getting the kids. You don't mean that. You're dead to me. You hear me? You're fucking dead. Without you, I am dead. Zoe! I can't believe it came to this. Me neither. You can't escape! I'm sorry. I don't think I can do this. What? Jason, what is it? All those people you were with... When I look at you, that's all I can see. Surprise! Whoo! Wow. Hi. Is it okay to hug you? I don't wanna break you. Oh, break my heart is more like it. Come here. Go ahead. I love you, Mom. I love you more. Come here. I missed you all. Me, too. I'm glad you're home. Hi, Brina. She's in there, watching TV. Okay. What is this? You don't even like television. It's numbing. What the hell are you doing, Zoe? You've been sitting in this house for months now. The pity party officially ends today. Look, I need more time. Mmm-mmm. Your time is up. You need to get up, and get your behind back to work. This ain't fair to you or those beautiful kids of yours. Now, come on. Come on. Uh-uh. I'm not... I'm not ready to go anywhere yet. I'm not ready to go. Dr. Spencer called this morning again. Says you're not taking her call. She asked that I make sure you get this. You know what, Zoe? You can try to chase me away, but I ain't going nowhere. Listen to me, damn it! Brina, I appreciate what you're trying to do, okay? I really do. Oh! You did not just turn that television back on while I was talking to you! Okay. If that's how it's gonna be, then we will just watch TV. But I ain't going nowhere. ...and you're going to have to make 250 portions. And then you think you're a chef, right? Well, I do hope so. Grandma! Grandma! Can I get a hug? Hello? Bye, babe. Mmm. See you. Silly banana... All right, go ahead. Bye, Dad. What do we do first? Wash our hands and do our homework. All right. How you doing? I'm good. But you're not. You know, the kids think we go to the hotel to let Mommy rest. I don't know how to tell them that we're apart. She loves you. She messed up. But she needs you now, more than ever. And if I can forgive her, so can you. What about your wedding vows? "In sickness and in health. " Those weren't just words, were they? Yeah, what about honesty and faithfulness? It's a sickness. Well, I have trouble understanding that. You two built this house and this family together. And just because it doesn't fit into a perfect package, are you willing to throw all that away? Here. Thank you, sweetheart. Welcome, everyone. Hi. Looks like we have a new member. Would you like to stand up and introduce yourself? Hi, I'm Zoe. Hi. And I am a sex addict. When I was 10 years old, I was raped by three boys. Uh, I buried that memory far, far away until someone I know reminded me exactly why I had to remember. It ruined my life. It, uh, destroyed my family. I, uh, would lie and cheat and do whatever I could to get that fix. I love my husband. I know it's hard for him to believe that, but I do. I miss my friend. I miss my best friend, and I know that with help from the one person that I hurt the most, I can get better. Our love is forever. Always has been. Always will be.
