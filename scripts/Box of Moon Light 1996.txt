Nice and tight up against the wall with a one-inch interval between the cans. All right? Let's see a double. Double! You got it. You got it. Hey, Al. What's going on here, Soapy? Nothing much. Just a little game to pass the time. I suggest that you postpone this little game of yours and get back to work... Pronto! It's a quarter to fucking 5:00. That's correct. Which means we have exactly 15 more minutes to get that turbine squared away for a systems check. We're on a tight schedule here, guys. Come on! Work with me. You got it, Al. We're with you, now. Let's break this up. That turbine's going in 15 minutes. Let's hit it! All right, Fuhrman, you take the left silicon switches. Get them all primed. You monkeys start calibrating the density magnetometers. Hey, Dex... Poker game tonight. My room. I'm there. You come too, Taco... and bring Elwood with you. Now, who gonna bring the beer? I'll bring the beer. No, no. you brought moose piss last time. Taco, you bring the beer. Nothing wrong with my taste in beer. Damn. I wish this place had a pool. What the fuck? Oh, sorry, man... I mean, Mr. Fountain. It's all right. It's all right, Dex. There's no harm done. You can call me Al, you know? Al. Hey, Elwood, wait up, man! Come on. Sure. I'd love to play poker with you guys. I'll bring the beer. I... I insist. I'm the boss. I'll pay for the beer. Poker? No, I really have no desire to play poker with you guys. Why? Because it's a stupid game. You heard me. It's a stupid, stupid game! Thank you. Hey, Al. What are you thinking about over here? Oh, nothing, really. I'm just thinking. What can I do for you, Soapy? I wanted to tell you I was sorry about the incident today. The guys were letting off steam. - It won't happen again. - It's all right. I understand. Sometimes I feel like letting a little steam off myself. Yeah? Why don't you come by the room, play some poker tonight? Poker? Hmm. Hmm. Maybe so. I got a couple things to get squared away, but we'll see. Ok. I'll see you there, then. Room 714. Take that! Hyah! Bobby, can you get that? - Hello. - Hello, Bob. It's your father. What are you doing? Studying. Good for you. See that? Summer school's not so bad, is it? No, sir. What's 12 times 7? I'm sorry, Bob. What did you say? No, it isn't, Bob. Put your mother on. - Hi, Al. - Is he studying, Deb? I don't get the sense that he's studying. He's studying, Al. Well, I want you to get him some flashcards, and I want him to know his multiplication... Did you have a bad day? You seem a little tense. No, Deb, I had a good day. I had to get firm with some of the men, But they took it well, which is good. Just trying to instill in them a healthy respect for authority. I'm sure they all like you and respect you, Al. Well, that's not my concern, Deb... although they did invite me to a poker game tonight. That's great! Are you gonna go? No, I don't think so. Oh, come on, Al. You should go. Listen, deb, I'll go if I feel like going. If I don't feel like it, then I'm not gonna go. No, that's good, Al. Well, we're right on schedule here, and it looks like I'll be home a week from today. So you're gonna miss the 4th? Yep. we'll work that weekend, and I'll fly out on the 5th. I should get into O'Hare around 4:38. I can't wait to see you, Al. I miss you. Well, Deb, it's my job. Sorry. I forgot. Thank god I didn't say something really stupid like "I love you." And I love you, too, Deb. Oh, mom, should I ask him... Hold on. Bobby wants to say something. Dad, can I get some fireworks? No, Bob. Fireworks are illegal. Good night. Good night. How's it going? Ha ha ha ha! How's it going, guys? Ha ha! How's it going? Hi, guys. What the hell did you invite Fountain for? Don't worry. He won't show. He's probably in bed right now with his nose stuck in the Abcom manual. He's probably jerking off to it. Hell, I'll bet he don't even jerk off. The guy better not show up, man. He bugs the shit out of me. Why? Why? He's an asshole! Oh, I don't know, Dex. The way I see, he's one of those guys who goes through life like a robot. He can't help it. He like a damn machine on automatic pilot. I feel kind of sorry for him. Yeah? I still think he's an asshole. So do I. You may be right. Are we gonna play poker here or what? Bring those pieces of pipe over there. We need that front end loader around here. Running like clockwork today, Al. Turbine's in. We're ready to run the system check whenever you want to give her the juice. Ok. All right. Systems check. We'll square that away right now. Jesus, Al. You look like shit. What did you do, party all night? I had a little trouble sleeping, that's all. Well, you should have come by the game. Yeah, I probably should have. What's going on, chief? The job is canceled. Canceled? what do you mean, canceled? Canceled over a management decision. They're giving us all our bonus, and... They're sending us home. Dexter moon. There you go, Dex. Gracias. Good job, buddy. Anytime. All right. Curtis Wiley. Pass this back. All right. Listen up. The shuttle van leaves for the airport at 3:45. I want all you monkeys to be on time 'cause I'm not missing that fucking flight. You got that right. I'd like for us to take a moment to thank our chief for getting us out of this shithole early... with a bonus on top of it! Let's hear it for Al Fountain. Let's hear it! Come on. All right. I'd like to make a suggestion based on experience, some of you guys might... Hyah! Take that! Hello. Hi, Deb. It's Al. Hey. Mr. Clockwork. - What? - Hyah! Well, it's 9:00 on the button. I could almost set my watch by you. Well, didn't we say I would call at 9:00? It's a joke, Al. Oh ho ho! I see. Yeah, now I get it. Listen, deb, I can't talk too long, But I just wanted to let you know that we're still on schedule, and I'll be seeing you in exactly 6 days. Hyah! What are you doing this weekend? Oh, I don't know. Some of the guys asked me to go fishing. I might go with them. That's great! See, I told you they liked you. Did you play poker last night? Yes, and it was a lot of fun. So... that's it, really. I'll call you the day after tomorrow. Wait. don't you want to speak to Bobby? No. I mean, yes. I'm practically out the door here. Did you get him the flashcards? I did, Al. Good. very good. Well, good-bye, Deb. Your father says good night. Listen, uh, Doris, I'm looking for a lake called Splashy Lake. Never heard of it. Really? Well, I went there as a kid. It was more of an amusement type of lake. Paddle boats, picnic tables, big slide. Slide? Yeah. This big slide that you had to swim out to. You'd go down this thing, and it would send you flying 10, 15 feet out into the middle of the lake. It was incredible... really. There's a swimming pool over in Neeterboro. They've got a slide. Oh. Ok. Well, thank you, Doris. Thank you. Have a nice day. What the hell is this? "Eddie's mix." Mix of what? Just a little drive, that's all. I'm taking a drive down the road. Life is a drive... down the road. Al Fountain... Saturday, June 30th... Here I come! I'm gonna get you! Mom! Mom! Jackie's trying to spit on me! Jackie, stop it right now. Leave your sister alone. Ok, mom. I'm just gonna tickle her. Come here, Candy. No! Stop! Mom, he's still doing it. Jackie, If I have to get your father, You won't eat tonight. Come on! Jackie! Jackie, I'm going to wake up your father. Is that what you want? Have you ever heard of a place called splashy lake? No, but there's a Splatchee Lake Oh, how do you spell that? S-p-l-a-t-c-h- double e. C-h-double e. Splatchee, not splashy. Is there paddle boats, picnic tables... A big slide? Oh, yeah. Lots of amusements. I can't believe it. I've been looking all over for this place. I don't know why, really. I spent a couple days there when I was a kid, And I just remember having a great time. Me, too. My brother and I drowned a cat there once. Is that right? Listen, how's the food across the street? Best I ever ate. Thank you. That pie almost looks homemade, doesn't it? Mm-hmm. It does look homemade. More coffee? No, thanks. I get off in half an hour. Thank god! First thing I'm going to do is take off all my clothes, take a nice, long, hot shower. That sounds good. You staying over at the motel? Actually, yes. I am. How's the hot water over there? I don't know. I haven't tried it yet. Why? Just curious. Just curious, huh? If she's just curious, why the hell doesn't she call the motel and ask them how the hot water is? What does she think, I was just gonna invite her over here so she could take a shower? Introducing our exciting audiotape series, heavenly faith. Jesus is strong, but he needs your help. Send a check now payable to Help-The-Lord Industries, and you'll receive... Hello. I'm Varla, and I'm lonely. Who are you? Norman. What a sexy name. It's making me very hot and horny just saying it. Norman. Wait, there's somebody at the door. their eyes red with lust. They rip my gown off, exposing my naked body to their evil gaze. Just as they are about to ravish me, I stick my fingers into their eyes and rip out both their eyeballs. Excuse me... Varla? I'm sorry, but, uh... This isn't too stimulating. Oh, there's that doorbell again. Oh, it's you... Norman. You stand there staring at me. I'm totally naked Except for 2 bleeding human eyeballs in my hands. You say, "Varla, I have never before seen a more beautiful, hot, sexy woman." Say it, Norman. Say it now. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! It's not where you're going but how you get there that counts. Al Fountain. Wait a second. It's not how you get there but where you're going that counts. Is that right? Jesus Christ. What is it? Well, wherever you're going, I hope to Christ you get there! Ha ha ha ha! Oh! It wouldn't be a very smart thing for him to do. Don't think he's gonna go in, do you? That's why I wanna talk to him a little bit. That wouldn't be a real good idea. Hello, there. You're not contemplating a swim, are you? No, no. no, I'm not. The wife thought you were going in. There's a chemical plant around that cove Been dumping formaldehyde in the lake for 15 years. You step in, and it'll burn your feet right off. Jesus! Thanks for telling me. No problem. Didn't wanna have to go in after you. I'm Luvven Coddle. This is my wife Wynelle. Howdy. Hi. Al Fountain. Pleased to meet you. It is a nice day. Yeah. Can I ask you, is everything all right, Al? Oh, sure. Everything's fine. I haven't been here since I was a kid. It's kind of a shock to see it like this. I can imagine. But we're used to it. We walk here every day. I'm not used to it. This was a beautiful lake. You ever go down that slide, Al? Yes, I did. Me, too. Just like flying, wasn't it? Like a bird out over that water. That's exactly what it was like... flying. I remember shooting down that slide and flying... My God, it must have been... Oh, 15, 20 feet. Yeah! Right out into the middle of the lake. I remember my dad was yelling for me to come in. I pretended like I didn't hear him and just stayed out there. And I kept on going down that slide even though I knew he was going to give it to me soon as I got in. What do you mean, give it to you, Al? Well, he pulled down my suit right here on the beach and he spanked me with this slide rule he always carried around with him. I'm very sorry to hear that, Al. It must have been... humiliating. Al, can I ask you... is there something else troubling you? Well, what do you mean? Forgive me for prying, but I... I sense a yearning in you, A searching... Almost as if you're lost. You've been lost for a long, long time. Am I right? Have you found Jesus, Al? Why? Is he missing? No. No, Al. He's with us right now, right here. Oh. I thought I saw somebody walking on the water over there. I don't think your salvation is a laughing matter, Al. Have a nice day. Nice to meet you. Some people, man, they got to stick their nose... Why they can't just mind their own... But no, that's not enough. They have to just... How about the salvation of your ass, pal... When I stick my foot up it? Holy... Aah! Wow! That was great, man. You all right? For crying out loud, what the hell were you doing? What do you mean? Stopping on a blind curve like this! You almost got us both killed! Oh, man... I'm sorry. My car just died on me right here. I can't even move it. I... You know anything about engines? Yeah, a little bit. Well, I already checked her out. I'm pretty sure it's the gasket. Could be that dang carburetor, though. Think you could take a look at her? All right. Out of the way. Oh, God. Hey, what are you doing? Be careful with that. Uh, you got trouble, pal. - Gasket, right? - No, no, no, no. It's the distributor. The drive gear's broken. This car's going nowhere. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Shit, shit! Hey, uh, what are we gonna do? What are we going to do? You're not gonna just leave me out here, are you? I'll drive you to a service station, all right? Wh-what about the car? You'll just have to leave it. No. I gotta get her home. And how do you propose to do that? I got a chain in my trunk. There you go, man. Slap that on her. Better lock it. Could pop off. I assume you've got the key. Shit! Shit, Shit! Goddamn it! What did you tell me to lock it for? Of course I got a key, man! Ha ha ha! What do you fucking think? Hey, come on. We got to figure out who's gonna drive. What do you mean? Someone's gotta ride the brake back here, But I know the road better than you do. It gets a little tricky. I thought you said you lived down the road. Yeah, just up the road a couple, few miles Through the woods. All right. You drive... But be careful. That's a rented car, and I'm responsible for it. Hey, I hear that. Oh, name's Bucky, by the way. Some people call me the kid or, uh, you can call me kid. Al Fountain. All right, Al. Like a fountain, huh? That's great. Listen, I really appreciate this. Ok. Let's get going 'cause I've gotta be someplace, all right? All right. Thanks, Al. Don't trip. Rental, huh? Ah, I like these babies. Jesus Christ! Whoa! Man! Ha ha ha! That is some weird shit, Al. Let's get going! Easy! What is this pigpen? Winston cigarettes? Cigarette? It's not funny. It's disgusting. Hey, how much further? Ha! Oh, man, I'm beat! Well, here we are, Al. You live here? Yup. I own my own home. It ain't much, but I'm off the grid, man. That's what counts. Come on in. I'll turn on some lights. Look, just get the key and unlock these cars. I've still gotta find a motel. Well... I'll tell you, man. Nearest one is a truck stop whorehouse off exit 58. Hell, you can stay here. No, I can't. I've got an important phone call to make. Well, shit, I got a phone. You can use it while I get the key. Kid? Kid, where are you? What the hell happened here? What? What's the matter? What do you mean? Where's the rest of your house? Oh, I only bought half. I got a really good deal. Listen, the phone's right there. When you use it, Only talk for 1 minute, 'cause I'm tapped in illegal, And anything longer they can trace. Christ almighty! All that driving wore me out. I'm hitting the sack, ok? You can have the bed. Ok? Hey! Hey, wait a second. No, no. I want you to have it. You drove me home. The least I can do. Hey! Hey, Buck... Give me the key. Kid! Hey! The key! Where's the key? Yeah. Hi, Deb. It's Al. Al! I'm so glad you called. Where are you? Remember I told you I was going fishing? We're all in a little cabin together. That sounds great. Are you having a good time? Great time. Listen, some good news. We're ahead of schedule, and it looks like I'll be coming home early. Al, that's great! So we can have a 4th of July. It looks that way. I can't wait to see you, Deb. And now I should go. Here, say hi to Bobby. Hi, dad. Hi, Bob. what's up? Dad, are the little fireworks illegal... The real little ones? They sure are, Bob. All fireworks are illegal. I was just checking. Good night, dad. Good night. Huh? Morning. What the hell was that? M-80. Them suckers pack a wallop, don't they? I got the cars unlocked. Come on, man. Get some breakfast before you take off. How long have you lived here? Oh... I've been off the grid now about 3 years. Dig in there... Before it gets mushy. I know what you're saying, though. The place could use a little work. You see, I'm kind of in a mediary stage. I want to go total self-sufficient... Solar power, windmill... Generate my own electricity. You know anything about that stuff? Yeah, I know something about it. You see that? I could tell you had a knack for things mechanical. What do you do? I'm an electrical engineer, actually... specializing in field installation Of Zeus Turbine Generators. No shit? I bet you'd even know how to change a distributor drive gear. Am I right? Listen, kid or Buck or whatever your name is... I went out of my way to get you home last night. Now I'm badly behind schedule. I'll drop you off at the nearest garage, And after that, you're on your own. That's fine by me, Al. Really. That's fine. What's with the costume, Buck? How did you know it was a costume? Is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah! I was an actor for a while... In this play about Davy Crockett In the olden days. You played Davy Crockett? Yeah. No, I mean, I played some guy standing around with a rifle, but one night I tried on Davy's costume, and it fit me so perfect, I just took it. You stole it? Pull up a second here, Al, will you? Hold on a second. Hey, there, Mr. Freaky. You been waiting for me? All righty, then. Let's get something to eat. You gained a little weight there, huh? Eating them apple pies. All right.

That little trick of yours almost killed an old man And 2 officers of the law. Do you think that's funny? I never thought of it that way. You're absolutely right. It was stupid. You must think I'm a worthless fucking piece of shit. Look, buck, I like you, but I have got to tell you something. I think it's time you got your life squared away. I think you're right, Al. Well, good-bye and good luck. All right. Al, good-bye. For Christ's sake... Where the hell... are the keys? What? The car keys? Yes. The car keys. All right. Hold on, Al. When did you last have them? When I drove you into town. Ok. Well, let's think. We got back. You got out of the car. What did you do with the keys? I thought I left them in the car. Might you have put them in your pocket? I might have... yes. Goddamn it! I bet they fell out when you were running around in that tomato field. Oh, Christ! All right. Now, take it easy. Take it easy, Al. First light... Crack of dawn... we go back to that field and find those goddamn keys. Crack of dawn? I have got to get going! I know you do, Al, and I'm damn sorry. I feel responsible. You're still there? Hey, don't think I'm happy about this. I wanted to get the hell out of here yesterday. I just bought $60 worth of groceries for a cookout. You and Bob get started, and I'll try to be there. Don't let him start the fire. Now, how's he doing with the flashcards? I'll let him tell you. Here's your dad. Hi, dad. Thanks for the flash cards. They're really helping a lot. Good. I told you they would. What's 12 times 8? Bob? Uh, 15? Listen, Bob, I'm gonna let you go now because it sounds like you've still got a lot of work to do. Thanks, dad. Good night. Good night. That's right, man! 'cause he did it! The little Cubano is tough, Norm. Yeah! Uncle Samson! Oh, come on! Hey. Dig in, man. Save some room for dessert. There goes the Castroator. He's in action now! Like wrestling, Al? I like college or high school wrestling, Not this garbage. Hey, this ain't no high school shit. This is professional wrestling. That's my guy right there... Uncle Samson... Ranked number one By the PWP and the WPW both. He's fighting some Cuban guy from Cuba. I feel for Sam now. This is a sad day for Uncle Sam. Ooh! Oh, no! Look out! Get away from there! You greasy bastard! Come on! Get away from there! Yeah! You go, Sam! I don't believe it! I can't watch. Sam's coming back. Look out, Castroator! What did I tell you, Al? Tough, isn't he? Shaking off a blow to the head like that! You know it's all fake, don't you? What is? The whole thing... The kicks, the punches, the chair smashing... They plan out every fight... who's going to win and who's going to lose. It's all fake. Everybody knows that. Uh, Al, I know you're smart 'cause you got a scientific-style job, but you're not using common sense. If this fight is fake and everybody knows it's fake, Why in the hell would anybody waste their time sitting around watching it? That's a question you might want to answer one day, Buck. I know the answer. This is what's happening all over America, Al. This country's being taken over By smart people with no common sense. And that's why I'm out here, man. Just me, my instincts, and nature. That's all you need. You see that moon up there? Look at that moon! Shit, in the city you wouldn't even be able to see that! The three-quarter moon, just about to slip into its second phase. Well, I don't know about that, Al. The Indians call that a creamy corn moon. What are you thinking about, Al? Well, it's kind of hard to say this, but I've, uh... started seeing things. Oh. What kind of things are you seeing, huh? Well, I'm seeing things moving... backwards. Like, someone pouring a cup of coffee, I'll see the coffee flowing out of the cup back into the pot. Are you serious? Yes. And other things, too. I saw a kid riding a bike, pedaling just like normal, Except he was moving backwards. Jesus, that's wild, man. Yeah. well, I'm a little worried, actually. I never know when it's going to happen. Well, listen, Al, don't worry about it. That's the main thing. You know, the Indians saw shit all the time. They had visions 24 hours a day. You think they worried about it? Hell, no. And don't worry about them car keys, either. We'll find them. I know right where to look, ok? Hey. Look what that moon's doing over here. Oh, watch this. Now I got a little box of moonlight. See that, Al? See what I did there? How's that hangover, Al? It's gone, right? Well, it's starting to go. I told you, man. It's this water. Funny about them keys, huh? I thought sure we'd find them. I've got another plan, kid. I'll call the rental office when we get back to the house. They'll call a local locksmith, give them the key code for the model number of my car, and I'll have a new set of keys delivered in less than an hour. Damn, man. That's a great idea. Why the hell didn't I think of that? It's called planning ahead, kid. You should try it sometime. Hey, hey, hey. Look at this. Whoa. What is it? Yeah. someone was here yesterday. Mm-hmm. "size 5. Mm-hmm. She's 15... She's redhead... Either a cheerleader or a swimsuit model. - Get the hell out of here. - No, no. I'm serious. Smell. I'm not going to smell somebody's underwear. Come on, smell. I'll show you something. - Smell that? - What? A kind of dry mustard smell mixed with, like, a bubblegum. Smell? Mm-hmm. Keep sniffing. Keep sniffing. I don't smell anything. Sure you do. I don't. Oh, come on, man! Your senses are gone! To my nose, it's overpowering. You see that? That's called sensory attunement. You should try that sometime. Ok. I'll start sniffing underwear Every chance I get, All right? Let's head on back. I have a call to make. Oh, that's right. Gotta get those new keys so you can get the heck out of here. It's not where you're going in life. It's how you get the hell out of there. What's that, Al? Where the hell are these people at 12:00 in the afternoon? I don't know. Lunch? Try them in an hour. Is that gun loaded? You bet your ass it is. You think I'm gonna let them F.B.I. sneak up on me? No fucking way. Well, just be careful with it. Hey, I know how to handle a gun, ok? Do you? I've shot a gun before. Good. Let's go get me a rabbit or something. I'm fucking starving. No, kid. I have to make this call, all right? We come back in an hour, you make your fucking call. Here. I'll get a shotgun. Plus, I gotta show you something, man. Open your eyes up before you split out of here. Wow. Look at that. wow. It's a deer. Yeah, that's right. Let's take a look. It's a fake. It's a statue. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! It looked real, though, didn't it? - Who put it here? - Me, man! Who do you think? It looks great there, really. It's great. Thanks. For what? For showing it to me. Oh, that's not what I wanted to show you. I got something. It's going to blow your mind. You wanted proof? Here it is. Come on. All right. here we go. You wanted C.I.A.? I'll show you C.I.A. What the hell... A C.I.A. nerve-gas factory, That's what the hell. They're making nerve gas To use in the war against their own people, ok? Ohh... Just blows your mind. I don't believe it. I just spent 2 days driving... In a goddamn circle. What are you talking about? That's the job I told you I was working on. Christ. The car-rental place is right in town. What are you t... Wait a second. You worked here? For a month. It's not a nerve-gas factory. It's a semiautomated facility For the manufacture of windshield wipers. Oh, I don't believe that for a second. All right. You want some proof? Come on. I'll give you some proof. Follow me. This is a Zeus 8000 turbine generator. It doesn't make nerve gas. It makes electricity, That electricity was going to provide the power for the entire assembly line. Making windshield wipers? That's correct. I suppose if you equipped enough people with windshield wipers, you could probably take over the world. Ha ha! Yeah. I can't believe you worked here, man. I could never do this shit. Didn't you hate it, Always having someone telling you what to do, Some asshole boss? Hey, Al? What? Come here. Think you can hit that bottle there? It's in front of the window. You can't hit it. Whoa! hey, close. That was close, Al. Let me try. Yeah! Jesus Christ, kid, that's an $800 window! Oh, baby! That's $1,600 right there! Hey, what's in those cans, Al? Paint. You sure? Yeah, that's paint, all right. All right! Yeah! Yeah! yeah! Reload! Windows! Yeah! Shazam! Whoa! I'm telling you, kid, this dog could climb trees. I'm serious. I don't believe it. He would just take off and run up the trunk. What was his name? Barky. He was just a mutt. He was all white except for one black ear. He found this rubber monkey somewhere, And every day, when I came home from school, he'd be sitting in the front yard with that damn monkey in his mouth, waiting for me to throw it for him. Kid, I'm telling you, I threw that monkey for hours. You still got him? No. I let him out one night right before I went to bed, and when I came in, he was shaking, breathing funny. I asked my dad if we should take him to the vet, and he said, "no. It's after 9:00. It's probably closed. We'll take him in the morning." So we went to sleep. Soon as it was light, I look under my bed... Because that's where Barky always slept... and I saw his tongue sticking out, all black. I touched him, and he was already hard, like there was cement under his fur. He was... he was dead. My dad said he must have eaten some poison. Your dad's a fucking asshole! Why? He should have taken him to the vet! I don't care what time it was! He was your dog, Al! Goddamn it, man. I can't believe it. Kid, what's the matter? Kid? Kid! You lost a hubcap over there. Good. they're open. I'll be right back. How did you lose them, Mr. Fountain? Carelessness, I'm afraid, Doris. Where is the car now? It's safe and sound. It's at my friend's house. It's a few miles outside of town. I'm going to have to charge you a $25 key-replacement fee. Fair enough. $25. I hope, for your sake, you don't lose these. Mr. Fountain? Mr. Fountain? Hold on, Doris. You just said something that was very, very smart. What? Well, why should I spend my last 2 days here worrying about losing keys, Especially since my friend has a car? I am going to give you directions, and what I'd like you to do is to deliver these keys to me bright and early on Thursday morning. We don't have a key-delivery service, Mr. Fountain. I see. But if you did... I bet you would have some kind of key-delivery fee. Doris? Have a nice day. Just my luck. Someone broke in this morning and stole all the goddamn keys. You're kidding me. What about the key codes you told me about? The bastard stole them, too. Soonest they can get me another set is Thursday morning. What are you going to do? Find a hotel, I guess. I don't know. I suppose you could stay at my place. I... I appreciate that, kid, but I'll only stay at your place on one condition. You let me buy you some food. I got food. Yeah, but I thought maybe we could do a little You know, barbecue chicken, make some hamburgers. You like corn on the cob? Are you kidding me? That's nature's perfect food. Good. Chicken, hamburgers, corn on the cob. Beer? Jelly doughnuts? Watermelon. Fireworks! Hey, that's not a bad idea. We'll get some sparklers. Sparklers? Are you fucking crazy? I got a whole box of fireworks, man... Real ones. I'm afraid those are illegal, Kid. Ha ha ha ha! What about breakfast supplies, kid? We're running a little low. Yeah. Good idea. Oh, here we go. What are you doing? My treat, kid. What else do you need? Luncheon meats? Yeah, yeah, and jelly doughnuts. - Jelly doughnuts? - Yeah. Got to have them. All right. Oh, I'm sorry. Man, watch where you're going! I'm sorry. What the hell are you looking at? Oh, nothing. Well, then get the fuck out of here, man. Thanks. Sure. Don't mention it. Jesus! Hey, bud, what's going on? Someone just saw Jesus on that sign. Where? In the fire, right below the hamburger. Come on, honey. Get out of here. You see anything, Al? No. Me neither. Damn it. You know, I always just miss those things. Yeah! Yeah! Take that, Saddam insane! Yeah! Ha ha ha ha! Yeah, you. We got back to the plant today and found some vandals had broken in while we were gone and did some minor damage to the turbines. I'm afraid we're gonna be delayed another day. Let me get this straight, Al. First you said you were coming home on the 5th. Then you said the 3rd. Then it was the 4th. Now, after all this talk about coming home early, Once again, you're telling me you won't be coming home until the 5th. That's correct, Deb. Early afternoon on the 5th, And I just want to say, I really look forward to seeing you. Well, Al, Guess I'll see you on the fifth, then... or the 6th or the 8th or the 10th or whenever the hell it is you feel like coming home. Here's your son. Here. It's your dad. Hi, dad. Hi, Bob. Mom's in a bad mood? I think so. I tell you what then, Bob. I only got a second. I know you're busy. Let's just do an easy one. What's 12 x 2? Bob, come on, now. That's an easy one. 12 x 2. I don't know. Bob, what are you doing? Nothing. Are you crying? No, sir. Hey, hey, hey, Bob, come on, now. Pull yourself together. There's nothing to be upset about. Everything's fine. Just keep at those flashcards. You'll be all right, ok? Ok. And a miracle happened today, according to Willard Snarp of Drip Rock, who claims to have seen the face of Jesus on a billboard outside the big lucky shopping center on route 17. It's Jesus, all right, dressed in modern clothes, wearing a suit and a bow tie. Can you point him out to us? There, in the flames. Experts from the Vatican will arrive on Monday to authenticate the sighting. Tina? In other religious news, police today arrested a local minister, charging him with a brutal triple murder. Police say Reverend Luvven Coddle entered the home of Earl and Lindy Sykes last night and hacked them to death with a small ax. Their 6-year-old daughter Mandy was also killed. Neighbors told police the Sykes had recently withdrawn from Reverend Coddle's church of hope and light. Hey, shut the fuck up! Goddamn it. Goddamn it! Killing a 6-year-old girl. Oh, what the hell is wrong with people? It makes you want to just get a machine gun And do something. Hey, don't open that! Why not? You'll let the moonlight out, man. Come on. Use your head. Let's get out of here. What do you mean? Don't you know a bar in town? Come on. I'll buy you a drink. Hey, good idea. I'm sick of sitting around this place. Hey, stinky. What's happening? Barnett.

He ever stops bleeding, he's gonna be blind... All right. Come on, now. For the rest of his life. Then we'll see that fucker jump every time I light a match. Let me take a look at you, all right?

Does she? Yep. Purlene told me so. Kid, let's get something squared away right now. I'm a married man. I don't make a habit of fooling around with every woman who kind of likes me.

Phone sex? Company called, um... Love Phone. You ever heard of it? No. I'm, uh, I'm afraid I haven't. It was the perfect job for me. I'm kind of a quiet person, Al. I like to just sit around and... think up things... you know, fantasies... Not all of them about sex. I got a whole bunch of stories in my mind about a princess who can kill people just by looking at them. But she only does it to guys who are mean to her, because there are a lot of nice guys out there. I know. I talked to a lot of them on the phone. What the hell are you trying to do? Why were you fired? They tried me for a week, but, um, guys kept hanging up on me. I guess I'm just one of those people who aren't sexy... even if it is just over the phone. Now, hold on a second, Floatie. I think you're exaggerating a little bit there. What do you mean? Well, I think you're... Sexy. Oh! Turn that tape over. Whoa! Whoa! Here we go. Hey, wow, man.

Thanks, kid. Ha ha ha! Thank you very much. You take care of yourself. Hey, you know me, Al. Ha ha ha! - 9 times 8 is...72. - Hey, there. How's it going, Bob? Good. I have them memorized, Dad.

So, you had a good 4th? Yes, sir. Good. Here's a little something for you, Bob. What is it? You'll find out. Ok. I'll see you in a bit, all right? How's he doing? We didn't get into it, Deb. I figured, you know, what the hell? I just got home. I'll deal with it tomorrow. Great. soon as you're unpacked, we can eat. It's a little early, isn't it? Early? It's 7:00. You always eat at 7:00. Oh, that's right. I forgot. I'm... Mr. Clockwork. Yeah, mister, uh... I'm glad you're home, Al. Well, Deb, I'm glad to be home. I missed you. I found this in the woods.
