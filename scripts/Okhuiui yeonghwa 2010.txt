A DAY FOR INCANTATION Ddaedabomok Jijilcaenabonba! Ddaedabomok Jijilcaenabonba! - Youngsu! - What? Never mind. It slipped out. - Who's Youngsu? - A friend from high school. His name just popped up. - His name is Youngsu? - You don't know him. Why are you smoking so much? I thought you were quitting. I will. Don't make promises you won't keep. Forget it. Do whatever you want. Where's the car? You don't remember? My wife isn't the same these days. Have I been inattentive? She won't talk much. And she doesn't really laugh at my jokes. Youngsu, was it? Who's Youngsu? Where's the car? It wouldn't move itself. It was here... I might be home late. I have a Q & A today. Q & A? They're showing that short I made today. - So you're drinking again? - I guess I might... We'll see. It won't be much anyway. You remember what you said? What you promised? Only twice a month. I know. I didn't say I'm drinking for sure. The whole crew will come and you know how hard they worked. You promised, just twice a month. How many times is it now? Whatever. There's the car. Right. There it was, all this time. As the morning light crept in through the window, he heard the doorto the hotel room open. The man knew who was coming in. He thought she changed her mind and forgave him. Before he hugs her, she stares at him. Her face is suddenly full of mischief. 'Cause I'm a mosquito. 'Cause I'm so cold, 'cause I'm a mosquito.' She says to him. Everything else is just technical things to fix. If you don't fix it, the narrative won't support itself. Your sincerity needs its own form. The form will take you to the truth. Telling it as it is won't get you there. That's a big mistake. Don't be so stubborn. You have potential. Dialogue is great. The characters' emotions aren't fake. There's a real sensibility. But if you don't fix this, it won't stand as a feature. Can't you understand? Do you want me to be greedy? Is that why you do it? Because of greed? What the hell do you know? So I'm doing all this shit because of greed? I'm showing you how to survive. You can't even change this? Turning points! Two turning points! That's how to take away what's fake in you, idiot! I can't. I just can't do it. I felt bad, so I told her I'd buy her a drink at Insadong. I need to cheer her up. - Hello. - Hi, professor. You had class today? Yes, I just finished. - See you later, sir. - All right. - See You at the restaurant. - What? Bye. Are we meeting later? Yes, some of the faculty. Aren't you coming? I didn't know. Nobody told me about it. We're meeting at three, at the Chinese place. - Yes, sir. - We'll just get a bite since everyone seems busy. Three o'clock is good for me. Why don't you come in to talk? - Yes, sir. - Come on in. Nothing good comes from chasing after money. They should've listened to me and built a reliable system first. To train and cultivate young talent. Look at this mess. Good things never come easy. You're right. They're all about money. Struggling artists like you can't make films anymore, when there's no more money around. It is difficult... Money ruins it all. Film as an art is finished. It's dead. It's the same overseas. It can't go back to how it was. Don't you agree? Yes, sir. I don't think so. Honestly, I don't know what I should do. Let's just read. In such a rotten world, only books will save us. Only books. I had nowhere to go on campus, so I went to the barber shop. One moment. I'll be done soon. Sure. Who's Youngsu? My cousin's name is Youngsu. Is she having an affair with my cousin? No way. That's Nonsense! - Professor. - What's up? I got a haircut. It's great to see you. I saw you a few days ago. How are you? I'm okay. Are you coming later? - The gathering? - Yes. - I'm not going. - Why not? Because of Professor Song. Professor Song? That Song is a piece of work. I almost raised hell. - Really? - You didn't know? He sold off the tenure to that new Mr. Bang. I found out he got a lot of money. He's insane! - Are You serious? - Dead serious. Bang only got hired for money. In this day and time! He's a scumbag. I can't stand the sight of him. He completely disgusts me! Is he really like that? Song would do anything for money! - Really? - Really. - For real, sir? - Yes. Anyway, see you around. - Take care, sir. - Yes. - Hello? - Hi, it's Sowon. Oh, Sowon. What's up? I was wondering where we're meeting. Right. I meant to call you. Sorry, but l forgot l have a faculty meeting. I can't make it today. I'm sorry. Hello? I'm already near Insadong. Should I wait? Oh, I see. But the thing is, I also have a Q & A afterwards. I don't think today will work. Let's set another date. What day is good foryou? I don't care. Hello? Why'd she hang up on me? What the hell are You doing? Sorry. Is it okay I took a picture? Do You know who I am? Pardon? No, I don't. Who are you? Don't take pictures without asking. You in A contest or something? I'm Sorry. Everyone's a goddamn photographerthese days. Do you know what you're doing? I'm sorry. I wanted to capture you. Why? Just. What kind of pictures do you take? That's A good camera. It's A Nikon. Nikon? It's pronounced nee-kon! How silly. I'm a filmmaker. Really? That's fascinating. Why? Just because... I also take pictures, so I know that feeling. But you shouldn't shoot someone who's sleeping. Il'm sorry. I'm a beginner, so I don't know much. I'm a film director. - So mine are moving pictures. - That must be great. They're a bit lazy. You just have to wait a little. It all depends on luck. - What does? - Photography. Here, I'll try it myself. I don't take pictures. You take pictures of others. Just pose. I really don't take pictures... - What's your name? I'm Jang Suyang. What do you do? Nothing. I just stay home. - You married? - Yes. I see. What kind of films do you do? I have to go. Let me just delete my pictures. Don't delete the ones I took. Of course not. Just the ones of me. Okay. There you go. Nice talking to you. Bye. That's a beautiful bottle. - Oh, it's empty. - It is. - You're quite the big drinker. - Thank You, sir. Great aroma. It's really something. I always wanted to try it. Mr. Bang. This must've cost a fortune. No, sir. It feels so smooth going down. How much was it? About four hundred? It wasn't that expensive. I'll bring another one next time. Congratulations! It's great news. Let's toast to Mr. Bang. Yes. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Congratulations again. - Thank you. Il really love your films. Really? Thank you. Say, what kind of person is Professor Song? - The professor? - Yes. He's a great man. I wish I had half the passion he has. He's selfless and moral. Never seen such devotion in a man his age. He's truly one of a kind. I was wondering what kind of man he is. Take it easy. He's selfless and pure. Unlike some other people. He reminds me of my cousin. He's a judo athlete and they look exactly alike. Oh, I see... I looked up to him when I was young. He was very hot-headed. He really reminds me of him. He's a very intelligent man. Right. Great having such a mentor, isn't it? - See you inside. - Congratulations! Do you always drink so much? That Jonny Walker Blue really got to me. It's so good that I couldn't stop myself. Working on any projects? Well, there's one l keep revising. But I'm not getting paid. Life is hard these days. And your wife doesn't work? She manages a cafe. It's not much. You really look like my cousin. He was a great judo athlete. Really handsome. I've thought that since I first met you. Could I ask you something? What? There's a bad rumor on campus about you. A rumor? About what? About you and some money. I tried to set it straight when l heard, but l wanted to ask you what happened. How could there be such a rumor? lsn't that wrong? Why are you bringing this up? Did someone make you? No, who would do that? It's so degrading that I couldn't let it go. You already knew? Just drop it. I know who's behind this. Just drop it. Mr. Nam, what are you doing? I don't think that's right. Words can ruin a man. It should be cleared... Stop it! What's gotten into you? He's making things up since he's being kicked out. He won't be here next semester. Who? He's leaving soon. He's only an adjunct professor. That's not the point. How can I sit here with you if I had the slightest doubt? I can't, sir. That's impossible! Must I really talk about it? People like that are everywhere. Just ignore them, orthey'll drag you into their shithole. If they come at me, then I'll strike back. Then I dodge them again right away. It's just one big fucking shithole! Professor. Then I'll keep believing in you sir, okay? - Go ahead. - Yes, I'll do that. - Go right ahead! - Yes, sir. You should study logic, Mr. Nam. Sir? Read books on logic. It'll do you good. If there are no questions, then I'll ask one. The film seems to be saying many things. What did you want to convey the most? Excuse me, I'm a little drunk. You drank? I just made the film. It wasn't with any theme in mind. My film is similar to the process of meeting people. You meet someone and get an impression, and make a judgment with that. But tomorrow, you might discover different things. I hope my film can be similar in complexity to a living thing. Starting with a theme will make it all veer to one point. We don't appreciate films for their themes. We've just been taught that way. Teachers always ask, "What's the theme?" But before asking, aren't we already reacting to the film? It's no fun pouring all things into a funnel. That's too simple. But people might like simple things better. Any questions now? Yes, over there. Mic, please. This is a personal question. I didn't plan on coming here, but I want to tell you something. I heard this directly from a very close friend. She said you two used to date. Do you remember? You were her teacherthen. That's your question? Is this inappropriate? She started dating you and broke up with her boyfriend. I know him too, and he still hates you. They were engaged, but his life fell apart. Maybe I shouldn't ask... Do you remember? It's been four years. I don't recall. When it's only been four years? That doesn't make sense. I don't know where you heard that, but I'm married. I know. You were married then, too. I didn't just hear it somewhere. She told me after the break up. She couldn't stop crying as she told me. And I heard it from her boyfriend, too. You really don't remember? This is bullshit... No kidding. How can you not remember? People's lives were changed. So that's your question? How can that be a question? Who are you to ask me this? I don't remember. Once I became a director, all these rumors began popping up. Don't mislead people by bringing up a rumor here. We're here to talk about film. Your film is just about you. And we pay money to see it. Then what should I be asking? And don't call it a rumor. I heard it myself. What are you asking me? She's devastated after dating you. Her life is ruined. What should I be asking? I've never done such a thing. Don't go around saying whatever you want. I'm going to jump in here, and you should stop. There are other people and other questions here. You know what? I'm not making films anymore. Satisfied? I'm not making films. I didn't make films for people like you. All right? Lee Sunkyun Jung Yumi Moon Sungkeun Kim Jinkyoung Shin sun Um Taegoo Seo Jeonghyun, Jung Daemin Jang Jungwon, Kwon Uyeon Park Seoyeon KING OF KISSES It was risky, but you pulled it off. You did it. You broke out of your shell. That's good. - Great job. - Thank you, sir. - It's really good. - Thank you. - You're the last one? - I think so. - Just keep it up. - Yes, sir. You did it. Thank you. - Hi, Professor. - Oh, hi. - What are you up to? - Not much. - Are you okay? - Yes. I've got to go. Done with class? You okay? - Oh, it's you. - Yeah. Is your class over? Yeah, with Professor Song. Well, see you. Did you eat yet? I'm not hungry. - Did you eat? - I thought I'd eat with you. - I have to go somewhere. - Where? I'm meeting Yangsoon. Oh, you're meeting Yangsoon... Why'd she drop out? Wasn't right for her. - See you. - Yeah. - Jingu? - Where are you? I'm with Yangsoon. Where? At Mount Acha. It's close to campus. Yeah, I've been there. l see. What are you two doing? Should I come? I miss Yangsoon, too. Yeah? It's Jingu. He wants to come. Sure. Hey. What were you doing in front of his office? Oh, that? I thought I heard something. Really? Didn't you? I know I heard something. Will you go out with me? - Why? - You're just so pretty. I'm sorry I'm making you uncomfortable. Thanks for the compliment. All the girls like you. Yangsoon likes you too. I don't care about that! I'm serious. No, she really likes you. What could you do for me? I've never felt this way. I've never dated anyone. Never? Never. You're the first. Couldn't you be with me? Can't we get to know each other? Just drink. Huh? Huh? I'll know everything if I know why this is here. However small, it affected me and changed the whole universe. Why did it have to be here? Fuck the bullshit in this world. Just tell me why it had to be here! Why right here, right now? Jingu. What you doing? Nothing. What is that? Up for a drink? - Drink? - Yeah. Are you kidding? What a piece of work. He's a psycho. - Jingu? - Yeah. - Congratulations! - On what? I heard you're going to win. - Says who? - Everybody. Aren't you? - I have no idea. - Oh? What you up to? It's freezing today! I have to go. Take care. Silly. You heard? Congratulations! There's a cash prize this year. Congratulations on what? Everyone heard at the pre-screening. Professor Song said you were the best. I didn't hear anything. The prize is three hundred. Let's drink with that. It's not for sure yet. Is he for real? Yeah, Song told everybody. Let's go get a drink. - Not now. - Why not? Tonight, afterthe festival. I knew you'd win. Big deal. Are you kidding? - I should go. - Now? See you tonight. You've reached voicemail. Press one to leave a message. Hey, Oki. lt's me. I didn't see you on campus. Can you call me? I need to talk to you. I might be busy later, but... I miss you so much. I really want to talk to you. I'm sick of everything here. Talk to you later. - You go ahead. - Should I? Sorry forthe hassle. Sorry I can't even buy you dinner. - Be careful. - I will. - Don't drink. - I won't. - Hi, professor. - Hi. Are you done editing? Huh? No, I'm still fixing things. - All right. - Yes. - Your phone is off. - I forgot to turn it on. - Did you get my message? - Yeah. It's so good to see you. - You get home okay last night? - Yeah. Did you? - You walked me home. - Oh, I did. Is your film in the festival? I think so. What about yours? - I didn't finish it. - Really? Why not? Didn't you know I'm a mess? No, you make much better films than me. Thanks. Going somewhere? Advising, and that's about it. - Want me to wait? - All right. - Jingu! - Hey. Psycho, way to go! You won. - Who says so? - Everybody. It's just a rumor. - A rumor? - Yeah. Okay, psycho. See you tonight. - See you, Oki. - Bye. - Bye. - See you, idiot! You won? 556 No. They're just saying that. Really? I just ran into Professor Song. lt didn't seem like it. l see. l should go. What should l do? How long will you be? Not even thirty minutes. Then l'll wait in the lobby. - Okay. - See you! What a nice spot. Nice and cozy. Let's drink. No, I'm okay. That's good. Why do you drink so much? Why shouldn't I? When did you start drinking? In college, I guess. Your nickname is "psycho", right? I don't have a nickname. They called you "psycho". Those goddamn idiots. You're pretty sane. No... I can't say that I'm sane. - Really? - Yeah. 'Cause all I can see is you. - 'Cause you're psycho. - Don't say that. Want some milk? - You have milk? - Yeah. I'll just drink this. I've never felt this way. I love you. It's cold, isn't it? It's not cold in here. I want to hold you. I want to hold you so tight. That hurts, you psycho! You're so pretty! You're just so pretty! No, I'm not. You're just a psycho. No! You're a good kisser. No, I'm not. You've really never dated before? Never! Is it okay to love you? I can't take it if you won't have me. I don't know, Jingu We should go. We didn't drink because of the film festival. Oki didn't want to go. Are you leaving? - Yeah. Bye. - Bye. Yeah. Why did you leave? You're not drinking? I am. Where are you? We're at the Cancan. Come here. Maybe later. Are you upset you didn't win? Wasn't that strange? He said you'd win. Whatever. Fuck this! You're upset. It's ridiculous! How could that idiot win? Who knows what Song's thinking? But he said you'd win. What changed his mind? Damn it. ls everyone there? Just a few of us. I'll stop by later. Hurry up. Let's just drink. Thanks. Oki isn't picking up again. Which apartment is it? Should've walked herto her door. Wonder if she's home, since it's Christmas. He keeps calling. There's something in the school water. Everyone's suddenly in love with me. - He goes to your school? - Yeah. He must be in heat. Must be something in the water. He even kissed me today. What? Then answer it. It's okay. Don't feel like going out. I need to get it together. You worry me these days. And who's that old guy? - Don't tell anyone. - Who would I tell? He's someone important. Someone famous. You've probably heard of him. But it's no good if he's married. I have fun with him. I liked him since high school. I know you'll go telling everyone. - I do that? - Yeah. Anyway... It's over now, so it's nothing. He's so controlled. We're both holding back well. Did you sleep with him? Yeah. Once. Just once when we were drunk. Well, that's just great! But it's hard to get over. He's so easy to talk to and fun to be with. You need to really suffer a bit. That'll teach you. I don't mind pain. But it's over now. Good. You should be more careful. You have to look after yourself. Yeah. I know. Where are you, Oki? Why? Why didn't you pick up? I kept calling. Did I tell you to call? Well... I've been waiting in front of your house for hours. You were calling from there all this time? Yeah. Are you out for Christmas? Where are you? I won't be home tonight. I have to go. - Oki, come home. - I'm sorry. Go home. - Oki! - Yeah. Hey! Hello? Shit! Jingu! Oki. What are you doing? You must be freezing. You're psycho. You were home? How could you do that? You were drinking. Yeah, I'm a bit drunk. I'm sorry. But you shouldn't just come over! - I couldn't sleep either. - Yeah? You were home... I did a lot of thinking here. - Aren't you cold? - Yeah. - Want to come in? - I do. Come inside. I like you because you're a nice guy. - You're good. - I'll be good. You happy we had sex? Don't say that. Fine. I'm hungry. You sleepy? Should we go eat? You're hungry? Yeah, sure. Are we dating now? Yeah. We're really dating now. I'm yours and you're mine. There's nothing good about me. You're everything I want. Every single thing. What am I? You're really smart. Only you stand out. I love the way you talk. They're all immature. I just want to be with you. You're good, so I can trust you. - You like me, right? - Of course! I like you too. I love you. You're the first. Thanks. Me too. I have Oki. I don't deserve her. - Merry Christmas. - Oh, Merry Christmas! - Let's go. - Okay. - It's not cold today. - It's nice and warm. Moon Sungkeun Jung Yumi Lee Sunkyun Song Kihyung AFTER THE SNOWSTORM Twenty minutes passed, and still no one. Was someone here? I don't see any bags. Lousy winter sessions. A TIMELESS RIDDLE: THE HEART OF A WOMAN Is it because of the snowstorm? Biggest snowstorm in a century... I can't wait anymore. I need to quit. lt's humiliating! Hi, sir. Damn snowstorm. Why are you out here? None of my students came. What? Not even one? Probably because of the snowstorm. But you're here. Those little idiots! You shouldn't go drinking with students. They're taking advantage of you. Those idiots. - I'm sorry, but... - Yes. I can't teach next semester. Why not? I might start a new film then. - Really? - Yes, sir. - A new film? - Yes, sir. That's great, but it's so sudden. Can't you shoot while teaching? I don't think l'm the teaching type. I understand. It's a hard job. Well, I have class. Don't wait too long. - Bye. - Bye. That's Oki. Good girl. Must've been hard getting here. I took the subway, but it took a while. There were lines on the stairs. Really? What time is it? About an hour past. How silly. What should we do? Whatever you want. There's another one. - Who? - Isn't that Jingu? - It is. - He sure took his time. A TIMELESS RIDDLE: THE HEART OF A WOMAN Want to ask me anything? I want to get old quick. How will I wait? You'll be old before you know it. How do you overcome your sex drive? Who says l do? Who overcomes sexual desire? Ever seen someone that does? Or even heard of someone that does? It's impossible, so forget it. Is love necessary? - You mean in dating? - No, just love. Don't ever love. Vow not to love and try hard to keep it. You'll still love something. Why can't people trust each other? Human beings aren't trustworthy. Become more tolerant, and you can trust more. Is it shallow to want beautiful girls? What's beautiful? What beauty do you see in them? Are we human beings or animals? Knowing the answer won't change much. What should we believe in life? It's your life, so find it foryourself. You choose what to believe. How is one wise? Wise...I'm not wise, so l don't know. Do you think l have any talent in film? Keep making films and you'll find out. Keep making films... Professor. Am I a good person? To somebody. What do you want most? Well, I want this today and I want that tomorrow. That's how I live. Is it okay to want an easy life? It doesn't really exist. Even if you want it... I've lived longer than you... - Afraid of getting old? - No, why? - Are you? - Do you have a lover? Yes, someone in my heart, but I don't sleep with her. Why do you love her? In life... Of all the important things I do, there's none I know the reason for. I don't think there is. I treated myself to some octopus. lt's not sitting well. Thank you. I'll always think of you, even after you leave. Call me whenever you're free. It's so sudden afterthe snowstorm. It's hard for me too. That's better. It feels good! Quitting was a good idea. I was a bad teacher. Moon Sungkeun Jung Yumi Lee Sunkyun Jung Yumi Moon Sungkeun OKI'S MOVIE I've compiled two experiences at Mt. Acha. Both were in snowy winter, first on December 31st. Then two years later on January 1st. December 31st was a walk with an older man. January 1st was a fresh start with a younger man. The guilt and exhilaration of walking one path with two men is why I made this movie. To see the two experiences side by side. The older man drove a luxury sedan. While he got the parking pass, I stayed behind, since he was a married man. The younger man drove a jeep. This time, I went along. Thanks. - It's expensive. - A little. It's nice having a car. It is. Now we can go anywhere. - That's nice. - How cute! The older man and I admired the wooden deer. The younger man and ljust passed by. Going up the hill, the older man held me. - Your first time here? - Yeah. Such a nice place nearby. - Let's come often. - Sure. I loved how he held me. First time here? Might have been here once when I was little. It's my first time here. Maybe for me too. It's so nice here. - Let's come often. - Sure. The younger man held me as well, and I loved it then, too. The older man and I stopped at the pavilion. He said he'd seen life and found peace with it. I believed him. What do you think? So, I held his hand. It's great. Everything except for you and me. The younger man and I walked past it. Happy New Year! - You too. - Yeesh. But again, I held his hand. The older man went to the restroom, just in case. We both went. The younger man also wanted to go, and we both went. I waited a long time for the older man. The younger man was already waiting outside. - There you are. - You wait long? As we crossed the bridge, I looked at his head. Don't lose any more hair. - Huh? Is it bad? - No, it's still okay. But you can't lose any more. We have a long time ahead of us. - It looks bad, doesn't it? - No, you still look great. Live a long life. Okay, I will. The younger man and l crossed without words. The older man stared at a beautiful tree, and asked me to promise him. Some day... I don't even want to think it, but if somehow we can't see each other anymore, let's meet under this tree. Every January 1st at 1PM, we'll wait here. So if we ever break up, on the first day of the next year, let's wait for each other here. It's a beautiful tree. - We have to break up? - No! I'm just saying if something happens and we can't reach each other. Just in case. I think l'll remember it. Let's do that. This is sad. It's okay. We won't break up. Of course not. You don't know how much I adore you. I know. That's why I love you, too. Thank you! - Should we go higher? - No. No? Then let's go down. I said the tree was beautiful, and the younger man agreed. We stopped to catch our breath. My heart was suddenly pounding. I looked at the time, but it was past one o'clock. Let's come here again. lt's great. - Yeah. Are we going up more? - Yeah, let's go. We're almost there. Why, are you tired? A little. Let's just go a little more. - Okay. - Let's go. There's nothing else I want. As long as I'm with you. You should meet other people, too. Not just me. Why? I don't meet other people? Try to make some good friends this year. All right. But guys only do three things: talking about women, bragging about themselves, or talking shit about others. They're immature. Is there anyone you really respect? No one that's alive. Makes sense. I really like Professor Song. But I don't think he likes me much. He's changed. Really? Then keep looking. You'll find someone. You're the one that only respects dead people. What are you afraid of? Really afraid of? Betrayal. That's why I'm scared to really love someone. I really love you. I see. I'm scared of dying. I'll live a long life. Until I can't poop on my own. Silly. You'll live long. The feeble ones outlive everyone. - You think? - Yeah. Then I'll live until I'm a hundred. Silly. I want to kiss. The older man and I made a stop to warm up. We had rice wine and seafood pancakes. Does Jingu still call you? No. Do me a favor. Deal with him. So he won't call you again. Fine. But what can l do? He keeps calling. That can cause problems. He's one of the kids close to me. I treat him differently because of how he is with you. I should be fairto him, but l can't anymore. Just be fair. What did I ever do? Make it so he can't mess with you. I can't do it myself. I mean, he wouldn't dare, if I were your boyfriend. What idiot would dare mess with you? He just keeps calling. But did I ever go? Don't take it out on me. Don't answer the phone. I really want to be fair. He's been so good to me! Then be good to him. That fucking idiot. The younger man asked if we could sit outside. I wanted to sit outside, too. We had noodle soup. The older man was sober, even after all the wine. It was awkward after the argument, but I felt I was truly in love with him. With the younger man, I felt a sense of distance. I felt we would break up some day. The older man didn't go to the restroom, but the younger man did. I went both times. I was waiting outside, when l felt someone's gaze. The older man was watching me from a distance. Expecting the younger man, I calmed myself down while watching the older man. He turned away when he saw the younger man. - Hey. - Sorry. Did you wait long? Hold on. He had come back to Mt. Acha on January 1st. Things repeat themselves with differences I can't understand. I wanted to see the two side by side. I chose these actors for their resemblance to the actual people. But the limits of the resemblance may reduce the effect of the two put together.
