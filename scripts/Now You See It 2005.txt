Others Think He Never Existed In The First Place. But Believe Me, He Is Real. I Know. I--I Was There. [Exhales] Some Of What I Witnessed Was... Pretty Terrifying. I Saw Things That Were So...Strange, So...Unexpected. Well, As Much As I Like To Think I'm A Champion Puzzle Solver Even I Still Haven't Figured Out Exactly How It All Went Down. But One Thing I Am Sure Of... Danny Sinclair Is Definitely Real And Unlike Anybody You've Ever Met. Oh, And Also, What I'm About To Show You. Was Never, Ever Meant To Be Seen. I Was Hired To Be A Segment Producer Of A New Reality Tv Show, Assigned To Make Sure Every Bit Of Action Got Caught On Tape. Mcallister: Everybody Take A Seat, Please. Thank You. As Thrilled As We Are That This Is The First Show In Television History To Be Produced Entirely By Kids, Not All Of You Will Remain. Only Those Who Discover One Of The 3 Final Magicians Will Stay With Us Through The Grand Finale. Think You're All Up For It? Oh, Definitely! Good. [Others Chuckling] Thank You. Heh Heh! Before We Proceed, What Is The Single Most Important Rule For Making Good Television? Oh! Make Sure They Spell Your Name Right In The Credits. Yeah. Yes, And You Are? Allyson Miller. I Think The Most Important Rule Of Good Television Is To Always Keep Your Camera Rolling. Excellent. I Couldn't Have Said It Better Myself. Actually, You Did. I Remembered It From A Quote You Gave In An Interview With Tv Weekly. October Of 2002. Well, It's Nice To Know One Of You Came Prepared. And Now It Is My Pleasure To Introduce You To Someone I'm Sure You Are All Familiar With. He Is Both A World Renowned Magician And The Host Of Our New Reality Television Show, Please Welcome The Amazing Mystic Max. Thank You. Good Morning, Ladies And Gentlemen. 100 Talented Magicians Between The Ages Of 10 And 16 Became Eligible For Our Show By Figuring Out The Hidden Message In This Poster. It Appeared On Billboards, In Magazines, In Newspapers And On The Internet. Hidden Somewhere In This Ad Is A Secret Message. Just Out Of Curiosity, Did Any One Of You Find The Hidden Message? Allyson. Big Surprise. Would You Care To Show Us? Well, As We All Know Magicians Say The Secret To Any Good Trick Is Misdirection. That Means They're Trying To Get You To Focus Over Here While They Do Some Hocus Pocus Over There. So Most People Probably Thought The Clues Would Be Found In The Magician And His Trick Because That's What First Draws Your Eye, But Truth Is It's The Background Things You Need To Focus On. See, The Spider Web Made Me Realize It Was Probably There To Direct Us To A Web Site. Then On Looking Closer At The Book The Statue Is Holding I Saw That It Was A Farewell To Arms, And Then Bam! It Hit Me! I Mean Everybody Knows That The Venus De Milo Is A Statue With No Arms. Sure. And That Made Me Think Of The Famous Founder Of The Magic Mansion, A Magician Named Antonio Demilo. I Mean, How Obvious Could It Be? This Is A Joke, Right? I Went On-Line, Typed In Demilo.Net And Got Linked Directly To The Contest Entry Form. Simple, Right? Well Done, Allyson. Oh! Thanks. Hunter: Know-It-All. Allyson, VOICE-OVER: Ok, So I'm Not The Best At Making Friends. I Know I Can Seem Like A Bit Of A Know-It-All But I Really Don't Mean To. It's Not Fault People Ask Me Questions And I Have Answers. I Mean, What Am I Supposed To Do? Hey, I'd Love It If Kids My Own Age Could Actually Relate To Me. I Mean I've Tried Pretending I'm Into Lip Gloss And Text Messaging And Hanging Out At The Mall. I Just Can't Ever Seem To Pull It Off. Ok, Sorry. What Got Me Off On That Rant? I Have No Idea. Seriously, I'm Not The Story Here. Danny Is. Ms. Mcallister Divided Us Into Teams. Each Team Had A Kid Producer, A Kid Cameraperson. And An Adult Mentor. Our Team Was Me, Our Camera Guy Cedric... Peace. And Our Mentor Whose Name Was Paul. We Were Sent To Find The One Kid Who Could Best Represent His Region On The Show. Mcallister: That's Good Work, People, Good Work. We Had Not Idea What We Were In For. Ok, Good Luck, Everybody. Let's Do This. Come On. Hey! Hi. Are You Blake? Yes, I Am. Hi, I'm Allyson. Nice To Meet You. Nice To Meet You. We're With The World's Greatest Magician. Wow! Sweet! Yeah! You Ready To Show Us What You Got? Yeah, Let's Go. Ok, Let's Do It. World's Greatest Magician, Contestant Number One, Action! Don't Take It Easy On Me. Get It Super Tight. Good Luck, Buddy. Unh! I Present... Siegfried... As Dog Gone! Ok, Now Be Prepared To Be Astounded As I Show You The Card You Just Picked. Ta-Da! Um, No. The Astonishing Linking Rings. Unh! [Whimpering] Allyson: Um...Brian? Ok, I'm Positive That This Is Your Card. No. This Your Card? No. Ugh! Unh! Unh! Oh! Go Back In! Go! [Yipping] This One. This One! This One? First, I Take An Egg... Crack It Into The Hat, Add Some Flour And A Little Milk. After I Stir It All Up And Place It On Your Head A Cake Will Magically... Oh, Wait, Wait, Wait! Appear. You Forgot The Rubber Cake. Oops. Ok. So Basically I Could Describe My Contestants In 2 Words: Impressively Pathetic. Hmph! Bummer, Right? If I Didn't Find Someone Who Was Cool Enough To Put On A Show, My First Chance At A Career Was Gonna Be Over Before It Ever Started. [Exhales] Cedric And I Were Down To Our Last Hope. Oh! Hey! [Alarm Beeps] Ok, This Better Be Good. Hi. Nice To Meet You People. Hi. Nice To Meet You. We're So Glad You're Here. Yeah. This Is All Danny's Been Talking About For Weeks. Great, Good, Awesome, Perfect, Yeah. He's Been Very, Very Anxious To Meet You People, Heh! Uh, Please Come In. Yeah. Oh, Ok. [Balloon Being Inflated] Hello. Uh... Heh! Hi. Danny. Hi. Allyson. Nice To Meet You. Paul. I'm Danny. Welcome. Ready To Show Us What You Got? Heh. Only One Way To Find Out. Contestant Number 10 Danny Sinclair. And...Action. 1...2... 3! Let Me Guess. The Incredible Popping Balloon. No, No. See, What's Supposed To Happen Is I Pop The Balloon And A Dove Flies Out. I've Done It A Million Times. Ok. Just Let Me Try It Again, Ok? Be My Guest. Ok. 1...2... 3! All Right, One More Time, One More Time. All Right, 1... 2...3! All Right, Next Time-- Next Time For Sure, Next Time For Sure. You Know, Maybe You Want To Try A Different Trick. No, I Can Do This, All Right? I Can Do This. You Need Any Help? You Want An Assistant? I Mean, We Could Always Try A Different Camera-- I'm Gonna Do It, All Right? You Just Gotta Back Off... And Give Me Another Chance. This Really Matters To You, Huh? More Than You Can Possibly Know. Well, If It Makes You Feel Any Better I Seriously Need For It To Happen, Too. You're My Last Chance. Yeah, And You're Mine, So... Let's Just Do This. Ok? This Time... This Time It's Definitely, Definitely Going To Work. Ok. 1...2... 3! Yeah. Thanks, Kid. No, No, No, Wait A Minute, Please, I Can Do This. Ok, I Can--I Can Do This. Peace. Guys, Guys, Plea-- [Exhales] Oh. I Bet The Only Reason We Did A Bajillion Takes Was Because Allyson Thinks The Guy's Cute. The Only Reason I Did A Bajillion Takes Was Because Our Other 9 Magicians Really Stunk. I--I Can't Believe I'm Gonna Be Off The Show. Hey, Now You Don't Know That. One Of Our Magicians Could Still Get Picked. You Seriously Think So? No! But As Your Mentor I'm Supposed To Be Encouraging. [Alarm Beeps] [Cooing] Whoa! Ha Ha! Tell Me You're Rolling! I'm Rolling! I Got It, I Got It! Cedric, You Rock! Wow, Man! This Kid Is Good! You Think Danny Did This? Of Course He Did. Who Else? Allyson, VOICE-OVER: Ok, Totally Bizarre, I Know. I Mean Danny Should've Been Looking Really Happy Just Then, But The Expression I Saw On His Face... Seemed A Whole Lot More Like...Fear. You're Right, Allyson. Very Impressive. Very Impressive, Indeed. Both: Yes! I Told You It Was Unbelievable. Yeah, A Little Too Unbelievable. Mcallister: What Are You Saying, Hunter? Isn't It Obvious? Her And That Danny Kid Must've Worked The Whole Thing Out Ahead Of Time. They've Been Scamming Us From The Start. We Were Not. Oh, Get Real! There's No Way You Pulled That Off Unless You Helped. Hunter, Allyson Wouldn't Do Something Like That, Ok? She Knows The Rules. Colluding With A Contestant Is Strictly Forbidden. Well, We All Know How Much She Likes To Be The Best At Everything. I Was There. I Mean, I Saw The Whole Thing. So What? He's On Her Team. Maybe He's Just As Big A Cheater As She Is. We Didn't Cheat, Ok? Yeah, Honest. I Mean-- Paul, You Were There. What's Your Assessment? Honestly, I Think This Kid's Real Deal. I Guess We Found Our Last Contestant, Max. Yes! Justice Prevailed. Danny Made It Onto The Show, Which Meant That I Did, Too. I Was Going To Be A Part Of The Coolest Reality Program Ever Filmed. I've Been Thinking A Lot About It And You Know The Way You Set Us Up Back At Your House With The Whole, "Oops! I'm Incompetent, It's All A Big Disaster" Thing Before You Completely Blew Our Minds With The Doves? That Would Be The Perfect Approach To Use In The Show, Too. It'll Catch Everybody Off Guard And They Will Love You. You Could Come Up With Something Like That Again, Right? Yeah, Yeah, Sure. Whatever. Great! Oh, And The Other Thing We Need To Talk About Is Costumes. I Want Something Eye-Catching But Not Flashy, Classy But Not Some All Black Funeral Guy Look. Ooh! What We Really Need Is Some Kind Of-- Of A Gimmick. Wow. An Exploding Wand, A Parrot Sidekick-- Allyson, All Right, Pick Any Card. Um, Ok. Any Card. You Got It? Yeah. All Right, Place It Right There. All Right, Here's What I'm Donna Do. All I Want You To Do Is Say "Jump." Jump. Right There. Oh! Whoa! Pretty Good. That's Awesome. Here, Here, Here. Why Don't You Do This? Pick A Card. You Want Me To Pick A Card? Pick A Card. I Want You To Pick A Card. All Right, Memorize It. I Got It. Put It Back Anywhere In The Deck. All Right, You Got It? I Got It. All Right. [Clicks Tongue] Is That Your Card? Cedric: Awesome, Dude! That's My Card. Oh! That Was Awesome! But This Whole Mopey, Brooding Thing You've Got Going On, It's Seriously Not Gonna Work For Tv. Too Boring. [Bell Rings] Wow. Yes. [Hoots] Welcome To The Magic Mansion And Congratulations To Our 3 Finalists. It's A Real Honor To Meet You. I'm Zoe And I'm From Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Honor Is Mine, Zoe. I Am Brandon. I'm From San Francisco, C-A. Good To Meet You, Brandon. I'm Danny From Pensacola. Yes. I've Been Looking Forward To Meeting You, Danny. I'd Like You All To Think Of This As Your Home. Follow Me. Wow. In Its Illustrious History, A Very Few Select People Have Ever Been Allowed Inside This Mansion. That's Because Very Magic Secret Known To A Man And A Few Not Yet Revealed Are Hidden Within These Walls. While Here During This Competition You May Use Every Prop, Every Book, Every Illusion We Have, And I Suggest You Take Advantage Of It. Remember, You Never Know How Strong Your Magic Is Until You Test It. Good Night. Oh, By The Way, You Might Want To Search Your Pockets For Your Room Keys. Whoa! Danny. [Contestants Murmuring] Allyson: Ok, Look, Danny, This Is How It's Going To Be For The Next 7 Days. You And I Are Gonna Be Like This! I Want To Know Everything About You. I Want To Know What You're Doing And What You're Thinking 24 Hours A Day Every Day. Right Now I'm Thinking That This Is My Room. So? So I'll See You Tomorrow. Wait A Minute. We're Not Done Talking Here. One Of Us Is. You're Blocking My Door. So? So Can We Continue This Tomorrow, Please? I Have Things I Need To Take Care Of. What Kind Of Things? None Of Your Business! [Exhales] Danny, I Don't Think You're Getting It. Everything About You Here Is My Business. My Business Is To Follow Your Every Move. Who Is This Girl? [Exhales] Look, I've Watched Liked A Gazillion Hours Of These Shows, Even The Really Gross Ones, You Know, Where They Have To Dive Into A Vat Of Cockroach Larvae-- What's Your Point? The Contestants Who Get The Most Screen Time Are The Ones Who Are Wildly Charismatic, Extremely Competitive And Have Usually Overcome Some Heartbreaking Obstacle To Get Here. Right Now The Only Heartbreaking Obstacle In My Life Is You. Oh, Come On, Please! We're A Team. Oh, Yeah? Then How About A Team Cheer? Like, Uh, Go, Team, Go! Ha Ha Ha! Danny, You're Not Funny! Open Up! Look, There's Things About Me You're Not Gonna Understand Not Matter How Much We Talk. So How About We Make A Deal. I Promise I Will Do Whatever I Can To Win This Thing For You As Long As The Rest Of The Time You Leave Me Alone. All Right. Excuse Me, Did He Seriously Think A Bargain Like That Would Stop Me? Ugh! I Mean, What Was He Up To? And Why Was He Being So Mysterious? As Far As I Was Concerned Danny Sinclair Was My Favorite Kind Of Challenge: Just One More Puzzle Begging To Be Solved. My Mentor And The Founder Of The Magic Mansion Antonio Demilo Was Once Asked, What Is A Magician's Greatest Asset? And He Replied-- "A Magician's Greatest Asset Is The Ability To Think In Unusual Ways." Well, That's Very Impressive, Mr. Sinclair. Yes, The Ability To Think In Unusual Ways, And That Is Exactly What The Nature Of Your First Challenge Entails. Watch Carefully. A Basketball. Oh! Oh, Wow! A Rope. A Broom, A 10-Gallon Aquarium And A Bed Sheet. 5 Very Different Yet Common Household Items And You Have Exactly 30 Minutes To Create An Illusion Using Any Or All Of These 5 Objects. Just Those Things And Nothing Else? Just Those Things, Nothing Else. And The Clock Is Ticking. I Know. It's Gonna Be Totally Perfect. Mcallister: Where Are My Cameramen? There's Cedric. So, Uh, Danny, Now That You've Done All This Intense But Not Very Interesting To Watch Thinking, Anything You'd Like To Hop Up And Show Us? Anything You Want To Try? Any Probably Futile But Charming First Attempt You'd Care To Perform? Have I Mentioned You're Making It Hard For Me To Concentrate? Ok, Maybe You've Never Watched Much Tv, But As I Said Before It Has To Be Active, It Has To Be Captivating-- Where Are You Going? I Can't Do This. What Do You Mean? No, No, No, You Have To Do This. Listen, I Shouldn't Have Came Here In The First Place, Especially Not If I Knew I'd End Up With You. It Might Help If You Try Clueing Me In, You Know. What's This Really About? Is It Stage Fright? Are You Freaked Out About Having To Perform In Front Of A Bunch Of Cameras? If You Are, I Totally Understand. Just Tell Me And We Can Figure Out How To Work On It. It's Not Stage Fright. Then What? I'm Only Trying To Help. Yeah, Well, You Can't. I'm Not The Enemy, You Know. Cedric And I Are Your Friends. Right, Cedric? Cedric! Attention, Please! Yeah, Thanks. Huh? I Was Trying To Assure Danny That He's Got Whatever Support He Needs Because You And I Are Here For Him. Yeah, For Sure. See? Great. Well, Now That We Have That Established Let's Just Cut The Chitter-Chatter So I Can Focus On My Trick. Uh...Good. 100 Have Tried, But Only 3 Have Survived. And Now The Stakes Get Even Higher. 3 Kids, 7 Days, Only One Winner. Who Will Be The World's Greatest Kid Magician? The Challenge Begins. First Up: Zoe From Philadelphia. Do You Believe In Magic In A Young Girl's Heart? How The Music Can Free Her... Anybody Can Bounce A Basketball, But How Many Can Do This? It Makes You Feel Happy Like An Old-Time Movie I'll Tell You About Some Magic It'll Free Your Soul But If I Try To Tell A Stranger About Rock 'N' Roll If You Believe In Magic Don't Bother To Choose If It's Jug Band Music Or Rhythm And Blues Just Go And Listen, It'll Start With A Smile It Won't Wipe Off Your Face Not Matter How Hard You Try Allyson, VOICE-OVER: Zoe's Trick Was Pretty Cool. Max Must've Thought So, Too, Because He Gave Her A 7 Out Of A Possible 10. Not Bad For Starters. Do You Believe In Magic? And Then... It Was Danny's Turn. So What Are You Gonna Do? [Exhales] Not A Clue. I'm Not Laughing. Good. Because Neither Am I. A Fish Tank. Uh, A Basketball. A Rope, A Broom. Yeah, We Know. Please Let Him Do His Trick. A Rope... Broom. Don't Blink Because All The Objects You See Here, They're, Uh... They're Gonna Disappear. Right! You Don't Stand A Snowball's Chance In You-Know-Where Of Pulling That Off. Oh, Yeah? Watch And Be Amazed. 1...2... Zoe: No Way. What Is That? Hey, What's Going On? Mcallister: Don't Stop. Keep Going, Keep Rolling. Whoa. Very Impressive. That's Truly Original. Uh...Thanks. Yeah, But Nothing Disappeared. What--What's With That White Stuff? The Trick Is Nothing. It's Real Snow. Who Does This Guy Think He Is? Hey, Hunter, Catch! Wait. You Said The Contestants Can Only Use The 5 Original Objects, But He Used This. Yeah! Snow Isn't One Of The Props. That's Ridiculous! He Just Did The Most Amazing Trick I've Ever Seen. It Doesn't Matter. Rules Are Rules. Only The Original 5 Objects, Max. That's What You Said. Yes, The Challenge Was To Think In Unusual Ways, Danny, And You Certainly Accomplished That. Yes! But Technically Speaking Hunter Is Right. You Were Meant To Use 5 Objects Only, So I'm Gonna Give You A 3. Yes! Ok, Let's Clean Up The Stage. Brandon, You're Next. If It's Ok, I'd Like To Use An Assistant For This. Danny's Right There. Use Him. But-- Mcallister: Oh, Stand By. Here We Go. Everybody Get Ready. Oh. I Call This Trick... Clean Sweep. Heh Heh Heh! Now, Danny, If You Could Unfold This Sheet And Hold It Up Like A Curtain. Easy Enough. All Right, Danny, If You Could Raise The Sheet A Bit Higher. You Know, Technically I'm Not One Your 5 Approved Items. Just Raise The Sheet, Ok? Don't Be A Freak. Heh Heh! And Now For The Most Amazing Feat You Have Ev-- Brandon? Uh-Oh. Brandon? [All Gasp And Chatter] Heh! That's--I Don't Know. Mcallister: Go With It. Max Seems Ok. [Screaming And Laughing] That Is So Crazy. Mcallister: Just Keep Rolling. Allyson: Will You Slow Down? What Happened Back There? It Was Brandon's Trick. You Ask Him. No, I Saw-- Saw What? I Think You're Hiding Something. Yeah, Well, You're Wrong. Are You Gonna Start Letting Me In? If Something's Going On Maybe I Could Help. Thanks, But No Thanks. I Need To Sort This Out Myself. I Can't Be Your Friend If You Don't Give Me Something To Work With, You Know. Look, I Realize I Come On A Little Strong And Maybe...Well, I'm Sure I've Gotten Too Caught Up In Trying To Figure You Out, But I've Got A Feeling We Might Actually Really Like Each Other If We Didn't Have To Be In Combat Mode Every Second. Ok. Uhh! Can We Try Calling A Truce For A Minute Or Two? Sure, Why Not? Great. So How Did Brandon End Up On That Wheel? I Don't Know. You're The Puzzle Solver. Why Don't You Tell Me? [Distorted Laughter] Ugh! This Is Where He Was Standing, Right? How Should I Know? Can We Do This In The Morning? I Mean This Place Creeps Me Out. No Trapdoor. There's No Way Brandon Could've Pulled That Trick Off Without A Trapdoor. Who Cares How Brandon Pulled Off The Trick? I Mean, It's Past Curfew, It's Dark. We're Gonna Get Caught. [Door Opens] [Whispering] Shh! Someone's COMING! I Know There's A Trapdoor Here. Hi, Guys. What Are You Doing Here? Same Thing You Are. Admiring The Fine Workmanship Of The Floorboards. Pretty Impressive Trick You Did This Afternoon. Sometimes I Even Amaze Myself. I'm Sure You Do. No Trapdoor. Yeah, So? Let's Just Say This. I Have No Idea What Really Went On, But I Know It Wasn't You Who Pulled It Off. Ok, So Prove It. Maybe I Will. Ooh-Ooh! Look, There's Gotta Be A Trapdoor Here Somewhere. Keeping Looking. Look Over There. Brandon: Ok. [Hunter And Brandon Whispering] [Birds Tweeting] Max: Good Morning, Everyone. I Trust You Had A Good Night's Rest. Now Let's Start. For The Second Challenge Each Contestant Will Receive A Wand Bearing A Famous Magician's Name. Zoe. Oh, Wow! Alexander Herrmann. Brandon. Oh! Harry Blackstone. And Last But Not Least, The Great Harry Houdini Is For Danny. [Others Gasp] Oh! Zoe: Wow! The Challenge For You Three Is To Research Your Magician. Select And Perform His Most Renowned Trick. Buona Fortuna. No Way! This Is So Cool. That's Awesome. [Coos] Ohh. Anybody Seen Danny? Can't Exactly Say I've Been Looking. He's Probably Somewhere In The Stacks. You Know What? Get Some Shots Of This And I'll Find Danny. Sounds Good. Hey, This Is Great. You're Actually Studying. What's Up? I'm, Uh-- I Don't See Any Houdini Books Here In This Mess. Don't Worry About It. I've Got That Wired. Then What's This All About? It's, Um, A Long Story. I've Got Time. Hmm. Ok, You're Always Claiming To Be The Puzzle Queen. Maybe You Actually Can Help. I'd Love To. See, Every Book Or Web Site I've Read About The Magic Mansion Talks About Its Secret Rooms Or Hidden Chambers. I Mean Even Max Mentioned All The Magical Mystery That This Place Holds. Ok, More Information, Please. Well, I've Been Searching Through These Books That Are Supposed To Tell The Mansion History, But... I Mean They Were No More Revealing Than Anything I Could've Gotten Out Of A Public Library. Where's All The Secret Stuff? It's Gotta Be Around Here Someplace. Hold On. W-What Are You Doing? J-Just Give Me A Second, Ok? Could You Please Tell Me What You're Doing? Look, See How Some Of These Books Have Markings On Their Bindings And Others Don't? We Need To Find All Those That Have This Symbol. Come On. All Right, What Now? See This On The Binding? I'm Betting These Are Your Puzzle Pieces, Pal. Now It's Up To Us To Solve It. Allyson, You're Brilliant. Thanks For Noticing. Don't Mention It. Let's Get To Work. Ok, Uh... Oh, Try This One. Switch Those Two. The Head Goes-- Yeah. Oh, This One. Yeah, That's The Head, There's The Tail. Danny, Look. Wow! Serpents. There's 2 Serpents-- Do You Recognize It? I've Seen This. I Can't Believe You Figured This Out. Well, Come On, Anybody Could Have Done It. Not Me. I've Seen This Someplace Before. There It Is. What Does It Mean? It Means If We Want To Figure Out Where This Is Leading Us, We Have To Find This Symbol. We Find The Symbol, We Find The Secret Room. Follow Me. Great. Let's Get Cedric. This Way. Come On. Uh, Guys, I Don't Think This Is Such A Good Idea. Would You Rather Stay Here By Yourself? No. [Rattles] Ok, It's Got To Be The Other Way. Come On. Yes! Look Out! Aah! [Bat Screeches] What Was That? Follow Me. This Place Gives Me The Creeps. Great. A Dead End. Hey, Guys, Let's Get Out Of Here. Wait, Wait, Wait. This Is It. This Is The Symbol. Allyson: Ok, So We Found It. Now What Do We Do? I Don't Know. I Don't Know. Just Come On, Help Me Out. Ok, That's It. I'm Getting Out Of Here. Hold On, Hold On, Hold On, Hold On. Maybe This Is A Clue. "Qui Libri Legat Aracana Intra Reperiet." What Does That Mean? It Means "Whoever Reads Books Finds Secrets Within." Or Maybe It's A Misdirection. That's What I'm Thinking. This Book Is Made Of Stone And If You Want To Read A Book, You Have To-- [Together] You Have To Turn The Pages! [Creaking] Whoa. We Really Ought To Get Out Of Here. Something's-- [Creaking] Cedric: Let's Get Out Of Here! You Guys Ready? Are You Getting This? [Scared] Uh-Huh. Come On, Cedric. Have I Mentioned That I'm A Little Claustrophobic? Will You Come On? We Need You. [Whimpers] This Is Pretty Creepy. I'm Not Sure I'm Really Claustrophobic-- Shh! We Probably Don't Need Anybody To Know That We're Here. Cedric: Why Not? It's Not Like Anything Bad Is Gonna Happen, Right? [Clanks] [Air Hissing] How Did You Do That? With A Lot Of Practice. Aah! Now How Are We Gonna Get Out Of Here? Danny: Guys, This Way. Come On. Oh, Now What? Wow, Here It Is. Wow. Hey, Guys, Have I Mentioned That I'm Really, Really, Really Claustrophobic? Just Get In Here, Cedric. I Can't Believe It. We Found De Milo's Secret Library. Now That We're Here, What Are We Looking For? Hey, Guys, I Wonder What This Does? Cedric, Wait! No, Don't! [All Screaming] Ha Ha Ha! That Was Awesome! Can Someone Please Explain To Me What Just Happened? I Don't Know, But Things Just Keep Getting Stranger By The Second. Allyson: No Kidding. Let's Get Out Of Here. I Hope You're Ready For Your Next Challenge. [Dramatic Music Plays] [Applause] I Proudly Present To You A Classic Trick Invented By Alexander Herrmann, But Performed By Countless Renowned Magicians Over The Years. Boy: Aw! They're So Cute. Maybe That One's Stuck. For Generations, Harry Blackstone Amazed People With His Levitation Of A Light Bulb. [Chuckles] I Will Now Attempt The Same Illusion. Whoa. [Applause] He Got An 8. That's Great. All Right, You're Up. Although Houdini Was World Famous For His Incredible Escapes, What You're About To Witness Was The Most Mystifying Stage Illusion Ever. To This Day, Very Few People People Know How Houdini Made A 10,000 Pound Elephant Vanish In A Flash. And Now, Ladies And Gentlemen, As I Attempt To Recreate This Stunning Feat, May I Present To You My Very Own Highly-Trained, Yet Deadly, Dangerous, Wild Elephant. [All Laughing] You Know, I Might Be Dressed Like An Elephant, But I Feel Like A Horse's Behind. Get Over It. All Right? And Now, Ladies And Gentlemen, For The First Time In Over 80 Years, May I Present To You Houdini's Original... Brandon: Yee-Hah! Ha Ha Ha! Vanishing Elephant. Whoa! Ha Ha Ha! Whoa! Whoa! Uhh! Hey, Hey, Brandon? You Ok? What? Ok, People! Everybody Keep Quiet! Everybody Calm Down! One At A Time! He Has To Be Kicked Off The Show. You're Just Jealous. Your Guy Levitated A 60-Watt Light Bulb. I Mean, My Guy Made A Mechanical Bull Appear. That's Exactly My Point. There's No Way He Could Do That. But He Did. Ok, How? How Did You Do It? A Good Magician Never Reveals The Secrets Of His Tricks. Or Maybe It's Because He Can't. Because It Wasn't A Trick. Then What Was It, Hunter? I, Uh-- I Think Maybe It Was Real. Real? Like, What If He Actually Has Magical Powers? Yeah, Right. Do You Have Any Idea How Crazy You Sound? Look, It's Possible, Ok? I Mean, There's A Lot Of Bizarre Things We Can't Explain Like E.S.P., Mind Readers-- And Donald Trump's Hair. And People Who Make Mechanical Bulls Appear Out Of Thin Air. Hunter: Exactly. And While We're At It, I Think It Was Danny Here Who Made Brandon Disappear During The First Challenge. [Sighs] Look, As Much As I Believe It's A Total Violation Of The Magician's Code, Why Don't You Just Tell Them How You Did Your Trick So We Can Move On. You Heard Her, Man. Give It Up. Yeah, Come On. Just Tell Us All How You Did It, Ok? We Really Want To Know. Ok, Fine! All Right, Hunter's Right. Girl: Huh? I Don't Know How I Did It. I Don't Understand Anything About Any Of This. These Things Just Happen To Me! Ok, There. You Happy? Very Good, Danny. That's The Ideal Answer. You're Really Learning How To Play This Game, Aren't You? What's That Supposed To Mean? Danny Just Evoked One Of The Oldest Tricks In The Magician's Black Bag. I Have No Idea What You're Talking About. Do You Realize How Many Classic Illusionists Have Garnered Endless Reams Of Publicity By Claiming To Have Actual Paranormal Powers? But I'm Serious, All Right? I Don't Know How That Mechanical Contraption Got There. Brandon Said He Felt Like A Horse's Rear End And There It Was. Well, That's Very Interesting. So, I Suppose You'll Have No Objection To My Getting Together A Group Of Distinguished Experts To Test Your Claim? Well, What Sort Of Experts Are We Talking About, Max? Well, As President Of The Worldwide Skeptics Society, You Might Want To Start With Me. Worldwide Skeptics? You? Surprised? Don't Be. No One Knows Better Than A Professional Magician What Nonsense Real Powers Are. In Fact, There's A Long, Illustrious History Of True Magicians Debunking Paranormal Pretenders. Because What We Do Is, We Provide Precisely Practiced Entertainment, And Every Fraud Who Comes Along Only Serves To Devalue Our Skills. So What Do You Say, Young Man? Would You Like To Settle This Nonsense Once And For All? [Knocks On Door] Danny! Are You In There? The Panel Of Experts Was Waiting And Danny Was Nowhere To Be Found. Call It My Own E.S.P. Or Whatever, But After Checking Every Place I Could Think Of, I Finally Found Him. What Are You Doing In Here? The Panel's Waiting. Danny? It's No Use. I Can't Do This. What? Why Not? Whatever Way It Ends Up, It's Just Gonna Be A Complete Disaster For Me. Why? So Far, You've Played It Perfectly. Seriously, Do You Have Any Idea What Great Tv You've Been Creating? Wait, You Don't-- You Don't Honestly Think You Have Real Powers, Do You? Look, I Need To Explain Something To You, But You Got To Promise Me That You Will Just Sit There Quietly And Just Let Me Get Through It. I'll Be As Silent As A Monk. So, What's The Deal? Come On, You're A Smart Girl. Think Logically. How Did Those Doves Appear In Your Van? How Did Brandon Disappear From A Stage That Has No Trapdoor? Nobody's Missing A Mechanical Bull Anywhere, But Yet One Totally Appears On Our Stage? I Mean, Do You Honestly Think It's Because I'm Such A Great Magician? What Are You Saying? I Was Serious Before, All Right? I'm A Freak. I'm A Freak. Your Powers? Look... About 3 Years Ago, I Was Walking To School And I Saw This Really Cool Skateboard In The Store Window. And I Was Thinking To Myself How Much I Wanted That Thing. 2 Seconds Later, It's Under My Feet And I'm Riding It. It Just Appeared? No, No. It Didn't Just Appear. Ok, I Made It Appear. A Couple Months Later, This Jerk At School Was Picking On Me, Making Fun Of My Hair Or My Pants Or Whatever, And I Was Wishing That He Would Just Get Lost. And Then He Was Gone. Then They Found Him Like 10 Feet Up In An Old Oak Tree Hanging By A Belt Loop. But How Is Any Of That Possible? That's The Point. I Don't Know. Ever Since That First Incident, I Have Been Driving Myself Crazy Trying To Figure Out What's Wrong With Me. I Can't Control My Magic, Allyson. I Don't Know How Or When Things Are Gonna Happen, They Just Do. That Must Be So Scary For You. Yeah. Yeah, It Is. It's-- It's Terrifying. That's Why I Don't Have Any Friends. And That's Why I Can't Get Up There In Front Of Those Experts. Either Nothing Will Happen And I'll Look Like A Total Fraud, Or My Powers Will Get Out Of Control And They'll Recognize This Great Gift Of Mine And I'll End Up On Some Government Operating Table Being Poked And Probed Like An Alien Lab Rat. Look... [Sighs] I Can't Even Come Close To Saying I'm Grasping All This, But I Certainly Do Know How It Feels To Be The Outcast, The Weirdo, The One Nobody Else Can Ever Relate To. Not Much Fun, Right? No, Not So Much. Well, See, That's Why This Is So Perfect. Maybe What You Need More Than Anything Is Just One Person Who's Really Gonna Believe In You. And That Person's You? If You Want Me To Be. Isn't That What Friends Are For? Yeah, I Guess. You Know What Else? I Think You Should Go Face Max's Experts. Maybe They Can Help You. Maybe They Can Explain All This. You've Got Nothing To Lose, Danny. I Mean, Isn't This Why You Were So Desperate To Get Here In The First Place? To Find The Truth? These Guys Might Finally Give You The Answers You Need. Allyson, NARRATING: Everything Was Set. Max's Panel Of Experts Included 2 Scientists Who Specialized In Explaining Unexplained Phenomenon. You Know, The Kind Of Guys Who Say That Crop Circles Are Really Made By Kids Stomping Around With Cardboard Tied To Their Shoes, Or That The Loch Ness Monster Is Nothing But Swamp Gas. Oh, And Just So It Wouldn't Be A Stacked Deck Of Techno-Geeks, Max Also Invited A Self-Proclaimed Psychic, Madame Susette. And Boy, Does She Look The Part. At What Age Did You Begin To Notice... [Chuckles] This Ability? Around 13 Or So. It's Common For The Powers To First Appear Around The Time Of Puberty. Tell Me, Danny, Is It Possible That These Claims Of Paranormal Powers Are Just A Ploy To Get Some Extra Attention Around Here? No, No. My Colleague Is Merely Making A Reasonable Assumption. Anybody Interested In Being In A Reality Tv Show Is Obviously Someone Who Craves A Lot Of Attention. Danny, Do You Have A Family History Of Paranormal Abilities? Your Mother? Your Father? No. An Aunt Possibly? Not That I Know Of. Maybe A Long-Lost Second Cousin Twice Removed On Your Father's Side? Look, I'm Sure We Could Go On With This All Day, But Either This Boy Can Demonstrate His Supposed Powers Or He Cannot. I, For One, Am Ready To Find Out. What Will You Be Attempting? Yes, Danny, Tell Us. What's It Going To Be, Hmm? A Little Localized Snow Storm Perhaps? Maybe A Mechanical Bull Appearing Out Of Thin Air? I Honestly Have No Idea. Don't Force It, Danny. Just Relax. Clear Your Mind Of All Thoughts. Let The Powers Come To You. Are You Up To It, Danny? Tell Us. Are You Up To It Or Not? Look! What? Boy: Do You See This?! Whoa! Girl: Remarkable! Ok, I'm-- I'm Losing It. Relax. Stay Focused. Breathe. What Are You Doing? Get Your Hands Off Of Him. Why? Are You Afraid I'm Affecting His Flight Pattern? You Weren't Actually Levitating. Were You, Danny? I Thought I Was. Of Course He Was. Oh, Really? Well, All Right. I Suppose It's Possible, But Instead Of Going For Far-Fetched Answers, Why Don't We Look At A More Logical Explanation Right In Front Of Us? Stand Up. Will You, Danny? You See, My Friends, The Secret Is Not In The Boy, It's In The Chair. Please, Explain. This Is A Very Clever Device Invented By A Scandinavian Illusionist Named Lars Holmstrom. He Made 2 Of Them. One He Kept For Himself And One I Have Here At The Mansion. I Keep It Locked Away In Storage, Although That Could Explain Why I Received Reports Of You Nosing Around Downstairs. I've Never Seen This Chair Before. Oh, I See. I Guess It Walked Up Here All By Itself, Didn't It? I'd Like To Demonstrate For You, Ladies And Gentlemen. There's A Trigger Device Right Here Behind The Left Leg. It's A Hydraulic System. A Thin Plate Recessed Into The Chair Seat Is Attached To A Rod Which Runs Right Up The Middle Spine Of The Back Of The Chair. It Is Able To Lift 200 Pounds. It's A Very Ingenious Device, But A Device Nonetheless. Danny's A Performer Like All Performers. But A Mighty Clever One, Don't You Think? Ah. Hunter: Well, Well. Brandon: Interesting. Danny, Wait. You Can't Run Away From Me. Whatever You Have To Say, I Don't Want To Hear It. Why? Because You Know You Lied To Me? I'm Not A Liar. Nobody Can Relate To Me. My Powers Make Me A Freak. I'm So Alone. Blah, Blah, Blah. Every Single Bit Of That Was True. Oh, Really? Because It's Feeling To Me Like Professor French Was Right. You're Only Using Me To Make Yourself The Star Of The Stupid Show. Oh, Come On, Allyson, That Is So Not It! Don't You Get It? Max Is The One Who Doesn't Want My Abilities Revealed. He's The One Who Rigged The Chair. Care To Tell Me Why? I Don't Know! Maybe There's Some Reason Why He's Out To Get Me. You Are-- [Sighs] You Are Truly Unbelievable. You Never Quit, Do You? You Actually Had Me Fooled For A Minute There. Except Suddenly, It Couldn't Be Clearer. You're Exactly Like Everybody Else I've Ever Known. Setting Me Up To Make Me Look Like A Fool. Just So You Can Prove I'm Not As Smart As I Think I Am! Oh, Will You Get Over Yourself! All Right, Did You Ever Stop To Think That Maybe This Has Nothing To Do With You? You Know What? Tell It Someone Who Cares. Sorry I Was Ever Lame Enough To Imagine We Were Friends. So, Where Did That Leave Us? As Far As The Expert Panel Was Concerned, Danny Was Just An Ordinary Kid Magician Who Also Happened To Be A Truly Impressive Trickster. Well, Much To Hunter's Dismay, That Meant Danny Was Not Only Still Eligible To Compete In The Grand Finale, But It Also Meant He Was Probably A Shoe-In To Win. And As For Me, Well, Losing A Friend Did Not Mean I Was Willing To Lose My Job. The Big Difference Was That From Here On Out, Danny And I Were Gonna Be All About The Show And Nothing Else. Hey, Shouldn't We Be Out Getting New Footage Of Danny Practicing His New Trick Or Something? I'd Love To, Cedric, But I'm Busy. Oh, Still Ticked, Huh? Don't I Have A Right To Be? I Don't Know If Danny Lied To You About The Levitation Chair Or What, But He's Still A Great Magician. I Mean, If Nothing Else. And We Both Know He Totally Pulled Off Getting Those Doves Into Paul's Van. [Scoffs] No, He Didn't. I'm Sure It's Just One More Lousy Trick. I'll Bet You I Can Show You How He Did It. Sure. Ok, Somewhere In Here We're Gonna See His Parents Or Somebody Show Up To Start Loading Those Doves Into The Van. How? Paul Locked It When We Left. It Was Still Locked When We Got Back. Maybe We Left A Window Cracked Or Something. I Don't Know. Hate To Tell You, But Here We Come, And Nobody's Messed With The Van. You're Opening The Door. I Still Haven't Seen Any Dove Wrangler. Did You See That? Back It Up. Back It Up. Those Doves Came Out Of Nothing. Now You See It, Now You Don't. It's A Miracle. Absolutely. Ha Ha! Without A Doubt. Danny's Not A Magician. He's A Wizard. [Indistinct Voices] Danny? [Knocks On Door] Danny? Danny? Come On. Cedric, You Check Outside. I'll Check The Vault. [Lock Rattles] [Air Hissing] Danny? [Danny Speaking Indistinct] Max: Come On, Danny. Sit Down, Relax. It's Nothing To Concern Yourself With. Danny: You're Sure? You Came Here Looking For Answers, Didn't You? Isn't That Why You Entered The Contest? Well, Yeah. I Guess. I Have Exactly What It Is You're Looking For. Sit Down. Danny, I Know All About You. I Know About Your Struggles, I Know About Your Confusion, And I Know About Your Powers. But Aren't You The One Who Said I Was Faking It To Get Attention? I Mean, Aren't You The President Of The Worldwide Skeptic Society? It's A Perfect Cover, Isn't It? You See, Every Generation One Or Two Truly Powerful Sorcerers Are Born With Magical Abilities That Would Boggle The Imagination Of Ordinary Men. I'm One Of Those True Wizards. And, Danny, So Are You. But How Did You Know? I Mean, How Did You Find Me? I Didn't Find You. You Found Me. I Created This Show Hoping It Act As A Lure To Bring Out One More Great Sorcerer, And It Worked. If I'm So Great And Magical, Then How Come My Powers Are Always Totally Out Of My Control? Well, You're Young Yet, You're Untrained, But All That's About To Change. What Do You Mean? Harnessing Your Power Is About Focus And Concentration. It's About Learning To Believe That You Are Entitled To This Great Gift You've Been Given. [Whispers] Oh, MY GOSH. It's Nothing To Be Afraid Of. Danny, I Have Felt Every Single Thing That You've Been Feeling. I Was Exactly Like You, Alone And Afraid. And Then One Day, I Met My Mentor, Antonio De Milo, And I Began To Feel What I Know You're Going To Begin To Feel. I Felt Safe. I Felt Home. And That's Where You Are, Danny. You're Home. Watch This. Now, You Try. You Need To Be More Centered. It's All About Concentration. It's All About Focus. What You Need To Do Is, You Need To Believe. There. You See How Simple That Is? All Right Now, Let's See What You've Got. Come On! Hit Him! Come On, Come On! Get Him! Danny: Ow! Get Back! Ohh! Get Him! Come On! Yaah! Come On! Yeah-Ah! I'm Gonna Get You, Max! Ohh! Max, I'm So Sorry. That Thing Could've Killed You. It's Fine, Danny. It's Perfectly Fine. We'll Work On It. We'll Work On It Together. That's What Mentors Are For. Meanwhile, I Have A Gift For You. Here. Slip This Ring On Your Finger And While Your Tutelage Proceeds, Your Powers Will Remain Totally In Check. There'll Be No More Unexpected Spells, No More Vanishing Friends, No More Having To Worry About Your Every Thought. Well, How--I Mean, How Is That Possible? Magic. Here. Go Ahead. Feels Good, Doesn't It? Yeah, You-- You Don't Even Know. But--But Are You Sure It's Gonna Work? Yes, I'm Sure. Look, I Know This Is Overwhelming For You. It's An Awful Lot To Digest, An Awful Lot To Grasp, So I Think You Should Go Back To Your Room And Have A Good Night's Sleep. I Want You To Have The Best Sleep You've Ever Had In Your Life Tonight. Danny: Thank You, Max. Good Night. [Door Shuts] [Door Opens] Allyson: Paul. Paul: Sounded To Me Like That Went Pretty Well. He Clearly Has The Potential To Be More Powerful Than I'll Ever Be. That's Why It's Imperative We Keep A Close Eye On Him. Not That It's A Problem. As Long As No One Removes That Ring From His Finger, He's No Threat, Because As You Know, He Can't Remove It Himself. And By This Time Tomorrow, His Powers Will Be Mine, Just Like Demilo Before Him. Danny, Please Wake Up. Are You In There? We Need To Talk. Please. Open Up, Please. Allyson. It's Late. Shouldn't You Be In Bed? Yeah. Yeah, Sure. After A Completely Horrible Sleepless Night, I--I Realized It Didn't Matter How Mad I'd Been At Danny. Max Was Up To Something, Something Terrible, And If I Didn't Warn Danny, Who Would? We Need To Talk. Nice Catch! Will You Listen To Me? This Is Serious! Max Is Not Who You Think He Is. Yeah, I Know. It Turns Out That He's The Only One That Truly Understands Me. No, Danny, You're Wrong! [Sighs] Look, It Would Be Better If We Could Talk Alone, Ok? Why? These Guys Are My Friends. I'm Actually Making Real Friends, Allyson. For The First Time In Forever I'm Feeling Like-- Like A Normal Kid. Yeah? Well, I Hate To Break It To You, But Maybe That Isn't Who You Were Born To Be. Cameraman: Hey! What The-- Wait. You Followed Me? No! [Sighs] I--I Was Looking For You, And I Heard Voices Through The Grate In The Wall. I--I Went To Investigate, Saw You There With Max-- All Right, Great! Then You Heard. All Right. This Ring's On Me To Keep My Powers In Check Until I'm Able To Handle 'Em. But That's Just It! After You Left The Chamber, I Was Still There When Paul Came Back, And Max Told Him-- [Sighs] He Said Your Magic's Too Powerful, That You Need To Be Watched. And He Also Said That-- [Sighs] That As Long As That Ring Stays On Your Finger... Your Powers Are Totally In His Control. Oh, Come On, Allyson! All Right, That Doesn't Even Make Any Sense! But It's True! You Know What? I Have Proof. Come On! Ok. Allyson, Good. I'm Glad You're Here. Hello, Danny. Uh, Shouldn't You Be Getting Ready For Tonight's Finale? Uh, Uh, Sure. Um, Miss Mcallister? Danny And Max Are Both Real Sorcerers, And Max Is Out To Suppress Danny's Powers. Danny: Allyson. I'm Not Kidding! I Have It All Here On This Tape! She Has No Idea What She's Talking About. Yes, I Do! It's All Right Here! Then Perhaps What We Ought To Do Is Watch This Tape Of Yours, Huh? Mcallister: What Is This About, Max? I Can Assure You, I Have No Idea. Allyson: Go Ahead. Show Them. Show Them What You're Really All About, Huh? Now You'll See. He Clearly Has The... Max: Well, Now, Um, What Do We Call This, Allyson? Polar Bear In A Snowstorm? This--This Can't Be. It Was--It Was Here. I Know It Was! I-- I Shot It Myself. You Guys... Please, You-- You Have To Believe Me. Don't--Don't You Get It? He--He Messed With It. He Did Something! Please, You Have To Believe Me. They're Sorcerers, Both Of Them! Only Danny's Basically Good And Max Might Be Evil! Oh, Yes, Yes, And... The Big Bad Wolf Is Coming To Blow Our House Down, Hmm? Please, You Have To Believe Me. I Know What I Saw And Heard. The Problem Is You're Confusing Fact With Fantasy, Allyson, And I Don't Think That's A Very Good Quality For A Reality Producer, Don't You Agree? You're Probably Just Overwrought And Overworked. We've Been Asking An Awful Lot Of You Teen Producers. The Pressure Was Bound To Get To One Of You. Danny, Please, Tell Her. D-Danny, Please. Tell Them What, Allyson? I'm Just A Normal Kid Magician Who Happens To Be A Truly Impressive Trickster, That's All. Allyson, I'm So Sorry That You're Upset, And I'm Sorry That You're Misinformed, But I Do Think That The Very Best Thing For Our Show And For Your Own Personal Health And Well-Being Is That We--We Send You Home At Once, Hmm? Well, It's Just To Get A Little Rest. No, You Can't Do This To Me! Miss Mcallister, Please, I-- Allyson, Max Is Right. It's Painfully Clear That You Need To Go, Ok? I'm Sorry. Wait, She-- [Indistinct Chatter] Allyson. Allyson, Listen-- Save It, Ok? You Had Your Chance To Speak Up, And You Didn't. Speak Up About What? All Right, You Said You Had Proof, But You Didn't. You Claim That-- That Max Is Out To Get Me, But You Don't Know How Or Why. I Mean, How Was I Supposed To Believe You, Huh? Besides, You Have No Idea How Happy I've Been Lately, Feeling Like-- Like A Normal Kid For The First Time In--In Years. I Mean, It's The Only Thing I've Ever Wanted. That's Interesting, 'Cause If You Want My Opinion, I Think What You Really Came Here Searching For Was To Find Somebody Who Could Accept You As You Are And Be Your Friend. Allyson, Look... Allyson! Allyson! Allyson! Wow, Look At This, Your Last Great Trick. Managing To Make Your Only Ally Disappear, Huh? Allyson: I So Stupidly Thought Danny And I Were Friends. But There Was One Little Thing That Wouldn't Quit Nagging At Me. If Antonio Demilo Had Founded The Magic Mansion And Served As Max's Mentor, What Had Happened To Him? There Was Something In My Gut Telling Me This Was One Last Puzzle Crying Out To Be Solved. Demilo's Power Seems To Have Deserted Him. A Prop That He Had Worked With A Thousand Times Fell On Him During A Live Performance And Crushed His Skull. And Then I Saw It, The Ring That Demilo Was Wearing, The Ring That Drains A Magician's Power, The Ring That My Friend Danny Was Now Wearing, And I Knew What Was Going To Happen. His Powers Would Fail Him, Too, If I Didn't Get That Ring Off His Finger. I Had To Tell Him Everything I Suspected, Everything I Found. I Wasn't Sure Exactly What He Was Up To, But If Max Was Now Planning To Rob Danny Of His Powers Or Perhaps Something Even Worse, He'd Have The Perfect Opportunity During The Finale That Night, The Finale That Was Just About To Start. I Was Out Of Time. I Had To Get Back Into The Magic Mansion To Warn My Friend. Sure. Ok. But How? [Owl Hooting] Mr. And Mrs. Sinclair. Hey. Welcome. How Are You? It's Very Nice To See You. This Is A Big Day For Danny. He's Excited. We Have A Table Right Up Front For You. Thank You. Enjoy. Hunter: Hey, You, Put That Trunk Over Here! Hey, I Need That Camera Out Here Now, Ok? Just Now. You! You! I Need You Covering Arrivals In The Lobby. Uh-Huh, Uh-Huh. Yes. Don't Worry. I'm On It. I Got A Delivery For Danny Sinclair! Let's Move, People! We're Live In 10 Minutes! A Little More Hustle Would Be Appreciated! Let's Go! Hi! Looking Good, Huh? My Headset, Please. Oh. I Just, Uh, Figured With Allyson Booted Off The Show You, Uh, Probably Needed Somebody To Pick Up The Slack. All I Need From You Is To Find Max And Make Sure Brandon Is Ready To Go On. I Hear He's Freakin' Out Over Some Sequin Crisis Or Something. No Problem! Ok. I'm Going On, In Like, 5 Minutes, And Nothing's Ready! Wardrobe Malfunction, All The Way! I Don't Get It, Max. How Am I Gonna Do My Final Trick If This Ring Keeps My Powers In Check? Don't Worry About It. We're In This Together Now, Danny. I'll Be Right There With You. Just Go Out On That Stage, And I'll Make Sure The Magic Happens. Isn't That Kind Of Like Cheating? I Mean, Maybe-- Maybe I Should Just Take It Off Until The Contest Is Over. No. Do You Remember How You Felt Before You Put That Ring On? Do You Wanna Feel That Way Again? Danny, I Want You To Trust Me. All You Have To Do Is Go Out On That Stage Tonight, Relax, And Have Fun. Miss Mcallister Needs You On Stage, Max. Yes. I'll Be There Shortly. Look... We Can Do Great Things Together, Danny. Don't Let Me Down. I'm Counting On You. Brandon: This Jacket's Not Even Buttoned Up Right, To The Light! Nothing's Ready, And I'm Going On In, Like, 5 Minutes! Nothing's Ready! Wardrobe Malfunction! Tonight Our Search Will Come To An End. 3 Incredible Contestants, One Final Challenge. Who Will Be The World's Greatest Kid Magician? Currently In First Place, Please Help Me Welcome The Brilliant Brandon Ross! [Applause And Cheering] [Applause] Keep Your Eye On Him. Ok. [Laughter And Applause] [Applause And Cheering] Hey. [Gasps] What Are You Doing Back Here? I Thought Max Banned From You This Place. He--He Did. But I--I Just Couldn't Stay Away, You Know? Me And Magic, We're Like This. [Chuckles] Yeah? Well, Too Bad, 'Cause I Think Security's Gonna Wanna Talk To You. Oh, Come On, Hunter. Don't Be A Jerk. I Mean, If You're Gonna Rat Me Out, At Least Let Me Show You A New Little Trick I Learned First. Well, What Kind Of Trick? Oh, It's Simple, Really. All I Do Is Make My Problem Disappear! Allyson, Get Back Here! Allyson! [Sinister Laughter] And Now Please Help Me In Welcoming Our Second Contestant, Philadelphia's Own, Zoe Cunningham! [Applause And Cheering] Camera One, Get Ready. This Should Be Fun. She's Really Cute. [Whispering Indistinctly] Hey, Man, Have Some Fun Out There, All Right? Thank You. Thanks. [Laughter] Psst! Danny! Allyson, What Are You Doing Here? I've Got Something I Need To Show You. It's About Max's Mentor Antonio Demilo. So? So?! He Died In An Onstage Accident During A Live Performance And Happened To Be Wearing The Exact Same Ring Max Gave To You, And You're Seriously Telling Me That Doesn't Mean Anything?! Yeah. Danny, You Didn't Hear Max Down In His Chamber With Paul. I Did, And You're In Real Danger Here! Allyson, That's Ridiculous. Max Is Controlling Your Powers With That Ring, And I Heard Him Say You Can't Take It Off By Yourself. If You Still Don't Believe Me, Then Just Take It Off And See How Different You Feel! I Don't Want To Take It Off. All Right? I Know How Different I'll Feel. I'll Feel Scared And Isolated And Petrified Of My Own Thoughts. All Right? I've Been There! And I'm Not Interested In Going Back. But You Can Learn To Master All That. Mcallister: Danny! You're On In One Minute. I'll Be Right There, Miss Mcallister. Please, Listen To Me. I Really Don't Wanna See You Get Hurt. Look, I Might Not Have Concrete Proof About Max, But I Know I'm Right! He Doesn't Honestly Care About You, And I Do! Please, Danny, I'm Begging You To Take A Leap Of Faith. I Gotta Go, All Right? Wait! At Least You Could Let Me Take Your Ring Off. You Might Be Able To Fight Back If You Need To. I'm Sorry, Allyson. All Right? I Won't Do It. [Applause And Cheering] And Now, Drumroll, Please. [Drumroll] Help Me Give A Warm Welcome To Our Final Contestant, The One And Only Danny Sinclair! Go, Danny! Yeah! Boy: Come On, Danny! Well, Danny, Here It Is. One Last Feat Of Legerdemain. How Are You Feeling? To Be Perfectly Honest, Way Too Ready To Get This Over With. Oh, Now, Wait A Minute, My Friend, You Mean To Tell Me That A Young, Skinny Fellow Like You Is Claiming That He's Able To Lift That Weight All On His Own? That's 1,000 Pounds Of Pure Lead. You Mean To Say That You Dare To Try To Lift That And Raise It Over Your Head? That's The Plan, Yeah. What Do You Think, Folks? Is It Possible? [Scattered Applause] Are You Ready, Danny? Absolutely. Well, Let's Get On With The Show. That's What We Came For, Ladies And Gentlemen. [Applause And Cheering] [Drumroll] [Exhales] [Audience Booing] Whoa. Wait, Wait. Hold On, Hold On. Woman: Give It Up! [Drumroll] [Booing And Catcalls] [Laughing] Woman: Give It Up! [Indistinct] Woman: Go Home! [Applause And Cheering] Come On, Danny! [Applause And Cheering] Yeah! Whoo! [Drumroll] See That? [Applause And Cheering] Danny, Look Out! [Women Scream] Woman: Oh, My God! Oh! Danny: I Can't Get The Ring Off! It's Stuck! Please Come Over Here! I'll Take It Off For You! Please! Come On! Well, Well, Well... It Looks Like We're Going To Need A Much Stronger Stage, Eh? [Laughter] I Can't Imagine What It Is Danny Intends To Do Next, But I Hope He's Not Planning On Using That Weight Again. What Do You Say, Folks? Why Don't We Give This Young Man Another Chance, Eh? [Applause And Cheering] Is There A Problem, Danny? I Said I Know About Demilo And The Ring, Max. You Tricked Me! Yes. It's A Pretty Clever Trick, Don't You Think? Yeah, Well, It's Not Gonna Work. Well, We'll See. Yeah, We'll See. Ladies And Gentlemen, This Young Man Is Ready To Work Again. Why Don't We Give Him A Nice Round Of Applause So He Can Finish His Act, Eh? [Applause And Cheering] It's Your Move, Danny. Uh, Special Delivery For Danny Sinclair? Well, What Could This Be? A New Wrinkle Has Been Added, Eh? What Is It? [Laughter] Well, Uh, Every Great Magician Deserves A, Uh, Beautiful Assistant, Don't You-- Don't You Think, Max? Oh, I Don't Know. It Seems To Me That Whenever A New Element Has Been Added Belatedly, It Can Be Quite A Sticking Point. [Breathing Heavily] [Audience Gasping] And... It Has Been My Experience That Not Every Assistant Is Quite As, Um, Sharp As She Might Be. [Allyson Yelps] Allyson! [Audience Murmuring] Well, Uh, They Do Say That--That-- That Good Help Is Hard To Find These Days. Well, As Amusing As All Of This Has Been, Ladies And Gentlemen, Particularly For Me, Why Don't We Give Danny A Chance To Focus On His Trick? [Applause And Cheering] Right, Right. Ladies And Gentlemen... [Banging] [Audience Murmuring] Allyson! [Applause And Cheering] Aha! Better Late Than Never. That's, Uh, My Motto. Allyson, What Are You Doing Here? I Told You. You Can't Remove The Ring Yourself. Someone Else Has To. You Don't Give Up, Do You? Not When It's Something I Care About. Well, Be My Guest. Oh. What Do You Think You're Doing? Oh, Well, My Final Trick, Max. Isn't That What You've Been Urging Me To Do? Ladies And Gentlemen, Max Has So Graciously Agreed To Join Me As I Perform My Final Act. [Applause] You're No Match For Me, Danny, With Or Without The Ring. Your Powers Will Soon Be Mine. Never. As You Wish. Your Move, Max. Ladies And Gentlemen, Let's Get On With This Show. Whoa! [Gasps] Ohh! [Applause] Whoa! [Audience Gasps] [Applause] Danny, The Ring! It's The Last Piece Of The Puzzle! You've Gotta Use It Against Max! Now It's My Move, Max! Aah! [Grunts] Aah! [Audience Gasps] What Is This? What? [Applause And Cheering] That Was Cool! Yeah, Danny! So, That Was It, The Most Incredible Experience Anyone Could've Ever Imagined, And I Was There To Witness It All. Of Course, Max Must've Gotten Paul To Take The Ring Off For Him, Because By The Time We Returned To The Production Office, Every Single Show Tape Had... Mysteriously Disappeared. But Then... Someone Managed To Make Them Mysteriously Reappear Right Here In My Room. I Cut Together Everything You Just Saw Because I Felt Like It Was Really Important For Everyone To Know The Truth. And Danny? Well, Once He Realized That Max Was Still Out There Somewhere, He Went Into Hiding, Hoping To Hone His Skills And Get Real Control Of His Powers Before They Meet Again. I Hear He's Definitely Getting Stronger Every Single Day. Unfortunately, Even I'm Not Allowed To Know Where He's Hiding. Ok, So Maybe I Do Know Where He Is. Aah! How'd I Get Here?! Magic. [Laughs] You Know, I Still Don't Know How You Do That! Oh, A Good Magician Never Reveals The Secrets... Of His Tricks. [Both Laugh] Show-Off! Do You Believe In Magic In A Young Girl's Heart? How The Music Can Free Her Whenever It Starts? And It's Magic If The Music Is Groovy It Makes You Feel Happy Like An Old-Time Movie I'll Tell You About The Magic It'll Free Your Soul But It's Like Trying To Tell A Stranger About Rock 'N' Roll If You Believe In Magic Don't Bother To Choose If It's Jug Band Music Or Rhythm And Blues Just Go And Listen It'll Start With A Smile It Won't Wipe Off Your Face No Matter How Hard You Try We'll Go Dancing, Baby Then You'll See How The Magic's In The Music And The Music's In Me, Hey
