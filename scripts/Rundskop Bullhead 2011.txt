But then you definitely with him testosterone to treat different... That will be, they go in my guy spraying. But Jacky has no testicles anymore. So we have him in his teenage years... necessary to give extra testosterone enough so that he can develop. You must do otherwise it will never be a man. Ask now. - Yes... You ask it. Irene, forward. We are big people. Ask what you want to ask. Will he be gay? Diederik is the only who can testify to that asshole. No, no. Jean, listen to me. If Diederik testifies against Schepers' son... Schepers cuts his fingers and we are shaved. You and me too. Would you like third world war started against a mafia figure? I do not want to go to jail, Jean. Schepers know too many of us. The prison that awaits us. And then also just for Jackie. You know who the real criminal? You, coward. Jacky, come. I could not talk to my dad. The stairs down. If you can do anything, sphere it only occasionally. It is well, young. Diederik. What do you do? Huh? Well? There he goes. Ask him whether it was an accident. Wait. It was not an accident. Stay here, eh, Jacky. Hey. Remember me? - What? Come on. You know that boy? - I hear you. You know him, eh? Come look what you've done. On your knees. On your knees. - Let me go. Look what you did.

Away. Day, sir. Can I help you? - Good day. Aftershave, please. - Certainly. Do you have a favorite brand? No. - Then we try a few. You follow me? So. This is something special, a hint of iris slightly powdery. This is seen typically in women's fragrances. Otherwise we have, our most masculine fragrance. Slightly fragrant wood. It's a classic. Very popular. And this is my personal favorite. Sporty, slightly lemony, fresh, young... For the active man. It's hard to choose, eh. I know what to do. I give you some samples with it, all right. You try them at home at ease. It is important to feel good, not only smell good. If you have chosen, will simply return. I take it. - A cologne. Why not? - For my mom. Of course. What a spoiled mama. Follow me to the checkout? Voil. 28 euros, sir. - Please. Thank you. There. Already have a loyalty card? No. - May I have your details? Jacky. Vanmarsenille. Roadway, Heers. - Dominate? The other side of the linguistic border? My mother lives near there. I will keep it, right? Well. So, good day, sir. Goodbye. - Goodbye. It's not. - What are you saying? Why? - So. Something's not right. Okay, De Kuyper has a reputation... but you said it yourself: We need him. This is an opportunity. De Kuyper has a head that does not roll. He scores his own shit. Not notice that we do now. Wait until they Daems' killer and see who remains. True or not? We're fine. We do not fuck up by a circusaap from the polders to work. You blow it seriously. You do De Kuyper like him whacked. Call it off. - Call it off? Come on, eh, calm. Let soon just something to drink. What did you spray on your? Sam Raymond. Leave the farm Vanmarsenille. Antony. - Hey, man. I thought Eva was not there, it must be something special. Not everything should be according to't book. - So I think there also. We are not by the book, huh. I go straight to the house fall Rikkie. I'd like to see programs, but afterwards. We need to separate business from... - From private? Of course, man. Shoot. Sit down. You suppresses things for us. - I? Not at all. No bullshit. I am warning you, do not. I mean it. I am cop, I'm looking for things, that's my nature. I feel you. I feel you. I smell you. And I feel that something is not right. Jacky has his dad at the time your dad denounced to the court. At that time, few resources and political interest. And suddenly comes Dad Vanmarsenille immediate cause, ideal for press and morality. Vanmarsenille free from persecution, your dad in jail. And yet they were good friends. And now that Jacky pop up in your entourage. Diederik, this is wrong. - Jacky here has nothing to do. We have known each other, When we were little, shit has happened with Jacky and me, heavy shit. Pedophilia or what? - No, man. Look, what his dad did, I would have done. Your father's wait time? - My father? My father is a coward. Was a coward. He made me silent. And then himself. I gotta go. - Me too. An appointment with your primary suspect. Diederik, give us one thing. Do it for yourself. And for us. The zoo had closed GAIA... and I as a veterinarian animals had to commute. Instead of sending them to the rendering plant to bring, I sold them. Restaurants. That month, all Congolese Matonge from monkeys ate... in Brussels from the zoo in Limburg. And snakes and all the shit. Dinner's ready. Pork Roast, croquettes and vegetable bed. And, Richter? What do you do for a living? Ask and I deliver it. My product is called networking. Very important. Very important. That's "a little reason why we are here together. Some networks can sometimes break. Especially the pharmaceutical, if you know what I mean. The court found hormones in my flesh which led to Pharmakin. What did Pharmakin? Our drop. I need no comment to make a deal with the cops. They said: We ensure that those caught. What can you do in such cases? Faster than they dare. Harder. - Ensure that they are afraid of you. So they are no longer with my balls rattle. They will by now have that does not trifle with us. Anyway... We will now ask more concerned with the smaller supply channels. Small is beautiful, as we say here. We need the hole to fill. Nothing else. And you will be our new supplier. Derrick, you're gonna help him. Richter and provides the contacts. What? Is not it good? Yes, yes, of course. I did not expect, that's all. I drive back tonight to Limburg. Why do not you participate? Then you see the Vanmarsenilles again. If we do, "one must therefore develop. I think a good idea of? Sam. The Vanmarsenilles. That's good. Excuse me, sir.

Who is this guy to you the whole time staring at? It is a customer. Stop it. - A customer? Have you seen how he looks at you? Not normal. I do not know. - Do you like him? He is...

Come on. Are you behind my back to the negotiate with De Kuyper? It's... No... No. I mean... It's more like a surprise. To show that everything is okay. What did I tell you? I told you that deal with De Kuyper was canceled. You know what it is with you? You have nothing. No balls on your body. Want to know how it is? Come on, Jack. - What do you want? You never know what it is. Both. You have to do both. Ah, sir Vanmarsenille. How are you? Everything good? Nice weather today, eh. Hello, you are the brother Stieve? It's annoying.

He has suggested to me that Fleming. I want you to steal a car for me. Christian is my cousin, a nice guy, but he has friends who... Do not worry, Flemish friend. Cars disappear is our business. He would never get rid of that car. He wanted to sell the parts. The next day Christian with Bayerische Motoren Werke... a BMW 5. - It's over. Stolen... - In Liege. No, that David has stolen BMW in Namur. Richter came back with's bastard Hymn of the Flemish. A butcher, with a scarf of Bruges. I did not say anything, but I asked myself: David, how do you know that Flemish bastards? My Flemish friends. What are you doing with those people, I wondered. Suddenly, five hours later Flemish legionnaire who was back there. He dumps the car in the garage and what do I see? The bullet hole. I think they... - Someone killed. The hormones hunter. Which bands? - Christian wanted to sell them. Ah, those tires. I knew that one of the brothers Vanmarsenille drove a BMW... So I thought, why does not he? I know him quite well. He comes along when he goes to the whores. I have the tires changed and the old Richters put tires on BMW. The next day I hear the news on the radio. So I drive straight to the Vanmarsenilles to retrieve the tapes. There is an error. Especially... Especially for Christian. My mobile. You want to know where those tapes are? Richter and other globe-Flemish bags work for Jacky Vanmarsenille. This guy is sick, 's got a head like an ox. The tires? Those of the murder? Well, who are with him. This is Richter's address. De Kuyper and Leon are in the female. Diederik. - Eva. Vanmarsenilles that? Who have nothing, and I mean nothing, to do with it? Sam I've never seen De Kuyper, let alone Jacky. That was just...

We are big people. Ask what you want to ask. Will he be gay? Diederik is the only who can testify to that asshole. No, no. Jean, listen to me. If Diederik testifies against Schepers' son... Schepers cuts his fingers and we are shaved. You and me too. Would you like third world war started against a mafia figure? I do not want to go to jail, Jean. Schepers know too many of us. The prison that awaits us. And then also just for Jackie. Do you know who the real criminal? You, coward. Jacky, come. I could not talk to my dad. The stairs down.

Very popular. And this is my personal favorite. Sporty, slightly lemony, fresh, young... For the active man. It's hard to choose, eh. I know what to do. I give you some samples with it, all right.

Okay, De Kuyper has a reputation... but you said it yourself: We need him. This is an opportunity. De Kuyper has a head that does not roll. He scores his own shit. Not notice that we do now. Wait until they Daems' killer and see who remains. True or not? We're fine. We do not fuck up by a circusaap from the polders to work. You blow it seriously. You do De Kuyper like him whacked. Call it off. - Call it off? Come on, eh, calm. Let soon just something to drink. What did you spray on your? Sam Raymond. Leave the farm Vanmarsenille. Antony. - Hey, man.

I mean it. I am cop, I'm looking for things, that's my nature. I feel you. I feel you. I smell you. And I feel that something is not right. Jacky has his dad at the time your dad denounced to the court. At that time, few resources and political interest. And suddenly comes Dad Vanmarsenille with a case, ideal for press and morality. Vanmarsenille free from persecution, your dad in jail. And yet they were good friends. And now that Jacky pop up in your entourage. Diederik, this is wrong. - Jacky here has nothing to do. We have known each other, When we were little, shit has happened with Jacky and me, heavy shit. Pedophilia or what? - No, man. Look, what his dad did, I would have done. Your father's wait time? - My father? My father is a coward. Was a coward. He made me silent. And then himself. I gotta go. - Me too. An appointment with your primary suspect. Diederik, give us one thing. Do it for yourself. And for us. The zoo had closed GAIA... and I as a veterinarian animals had to commute. Instead of sending them to the rendering plant to bring, I sold them. Restaurants. That month, all Congolese Matonge from monkeys ate... in Brussels from the zoo in Limburg. And snakes and all the shit. Dinner's ready. Pork Roast, croquettes and vegetable bed. And, Richter? What do you do for a living? Ask and I deliver it. My product is called networking. Very important. Very important. That's "a little reason why we are here together. Some networks can sometimes break. Especially the pharmaceutical, if you know what I mean. The court found hormones in my flesh which led to Pharmakin. What did Pharmakin? Our drop. I need no comment to make a deal with the cops. They said: We ensure that those caught. What can you do in such cases? Faster than they dare. Harder. - Ensure that they are afraid of you. So they are no longer with my balls rattle. They will by now have that does not trifle with us. Anyway... We will now ask more concerned with the smaller supply channels. Small is beautiful, as we say here. We need the hole to fill. Nothing else. And you will be our new supplier. Derrick, you're gonna help him. Richter and provides the contacts. What? Is not it good? Yes, yes, of course. I did not expect, that's all. I drive back tonight to Limburg.

He has suggested to me that Fleming. I want you to steal a car for me. Christian is my cousin, a nice guy, but he has friends who... Do not worry, Flemish friend. Cars disappear is our business. He would never get rid of that car. He wanted to sell the parts. The next day Christian with Bayerische Motoren Werke... a BMW 5. - It's over. Stolen... - In Liege. No, that David has stolen BMW in Namur. Richter came back with's bastard Hymn of the Flemish. A butcher, with a scarf of Bruges.
