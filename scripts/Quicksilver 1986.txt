It's ''cherridy,'' man. Beautiful. Look at the wheels. They're new. Yeah, well, almost new. And dig, man, it's got two sections-- got your hot dogs, got your ices. The umbrella, I'd get rid of that. I'd put my own, you know. Thank you. ''Hector's Hot Dogs.'' - Uh-huh. - So, what do you think, man? You know what I think? I think you're gonna get flat feet standin' in one place. Ah, there's no future on a bike. You fall, you get hurt... you can't work, no money. Look, I want something to look forward to. Can't stay on a bike forever, man. Seventh Avenue, two of'em, Shortstop. Go ahead. I'm telling you, they would never kick a door down, not my guys. Apache, Midway. Go. Whoa. Excuse me. You dropped somethin'. Thanks. All right! Come on. Come on, fellas. Back to work. Anyway, I see interest rates going down. The Fed is expanding the money supply, so I would... move to decrease our cash position, increase stock equity. Yeah, but not yet. Interest rates'll bump a few more points first, man. I'd buy high tech-- I BM, Teledyne. What? That's what old man Anderson said. I wasn't sure. Now I am. Listen,jack. I wanna be straight with you. Anderson wants to back us. But it's you they really want. I'm just part of the package. I mean, not that I'm not good. I make that jerk Anderson look like a hero. But I don't have half of what you have. You had the touch,jack. Anyway, he'll back us 1 00%%. I spoke to the lawyers, Burke and Blum. They're the best. Two years, three years tops, we buy out Anderson's interest. jack, we'd be back in business our way. Gabe, I'm happy for ya. I am. But... I can't. - What do you mean, can't? - Look, you're my friend. The best. I know you want it to be like it was, but it's not for me. Not now. You're telling me that driving a bike and delivering junk, that's for you? I don't believe it,jack. I don't. - If not now,jack, when? - Gabe, don't you understand? I don't have it anymore. I don't have the nerve. Okay... you see, that was my-- That's what drove me. And it went that day. I don't know where it went, you know, but it's gone. You see, now all I'm responsible for is me. Okay? I pick up here, I deliver there. It's simple. Nobody worries, nobody gets hurt. I pay my rent... I got a couple extra bucks. If I need more, I work a few more runs. And... when I'm on the street, I feel good, man. I feel good. I feel... exhilarated. I go as fast as I like-- faster than anyone. A street sign says ''One Way, East,'' I go west. They can't touch me. When I'm on a bike, I forget about-- Well, I don't know. - Hey, no, no, no. - No, I got it. I got it. Thanks for the coffee. Hey, what's that mean right there,jack? - Collateral. - Right. What's ''collateral'' mean? What's this? ''Loan application.'' What are you doin'? I'm borrowing some money-- you know, for the cart. So? - So, what? - So, what does ''collateral'' mean? It means you ain't gettin' no loan. What it means is you've gotta have capital goods. - Capital goods? - Yeah. Something that is worth the same amount or more than the principal. The principal is the amount of money that you want to borrow. - Seven grand. - Right. You got something worth $7,000? Oh, yeah. His pretty ass on the street! Let me get this straight. You mean I gotta have something worth seven Gs if I wanna borrow seven Gs? - Right. - Shit, if I had something... worth seven grand, what the hell would I need to ask the bank for? Well, it's a little more complicated than that. Don't you understand, brother... that you's a spick... a beaner? I mean, ain't gonna be no white shirt and tie for you. It takes it to get it. The man says, ''If you don't have it, then you ain't gonna get it.'' It ain't the man that steals your future. It's your bitterness. Oh, I guess I'm just a dumb ol' uptown nigger. I don't know nothin' about whatjack here knows, right? - Right. - Well, if that's the case... and jack is so smart, then what's he doin' here? Hey, Voodoo, you got something to say to me? I say you full of shit,jack. I say he'll beat your ass on any street, any day of the week. Oh, yeah? Well, where did you hear this? I wanna know how you knew that. Because your big mouth would catch too much wind, that's why. All right, flyboy. Money talks... and bullshit walks. Check it out. It's on the table, man. - Hey, I'll take some of that. - Yeah! Hey, Voodoo, we down. - Hey, where you going,jack? - Look, Hector. This is a job, okay? It's not a game. I got deliveries to make. Hey, but the fellas, they got the money down on you. I got a cheese sandwich and a coffee. Give the change to Bernadette. Hey, watch it! Yo! One side! What's the matter with you? What are you doing riding on the sidewalk? Are you crazy? What the hell are you doing? Wait a second! I gotta get this stuff picked up! I'm tellin' you,jack, forget about it. You're messin' with something you don't know nothin' about. All I'm sayin' is... he could've avoided him. He could've. I was there. He ran him down for nothin'. Not just for nothin'. Voodoo was known to carry product for some people. - Yeah, to Gypsy. - I don't know who. - He doesn't know who. - The brothers know who. I don't wanna know who. Voodoo stepped into that meat grinder because he wanted the fast money. He volunteered. just be happy it wasn't a closer race... or there would've been two funerals. Dig? Yeah, Quicksilver. Oh, yeah, sure. She's still with us. Right. Uh-huh. You got it. Terri. - What? - Terri, you got a command performance. 2829 Grand. - What's ''a command performance''? - That means you did a good job. They asked for you by name. - Come here. - I can't. I'm workin'. Yeah. 2829 Grand. - Yeah. - That's me. Come here. You know where this is? You didn't look at the address. - 21 West Eighty-eighth Street. - Know where that is? Yeah, it's off the park. What do you need me for? You got a car. You wanna conduct an interview, or do you wanna work? - I was just-- - Look, Terri. I'll find someone else. Give it back. No, that's all right. I'll do it. I'm sorry. I'll call you from time to time. I call... you come. Thank you, Maria. - So? - So, it's all there. All right. Wait a minute. You don't have the money yet. All you got there is a neatly typed loan application. What I got here is a chance-- a chance at somethin' better. Yeah, we'll see. - Friday, huh? - Yeah. jack, I'm telling you, this is just the beginning. This cart is just number one. I'm gonna work hard, I'm gonna watch the money. Pretty soon two, then three, then four. Who knows? Five, six. You're gonna see ''Hector.'' That's my dream. You know, Hector, sometimes things don't work out the way you plan. I mean, they can backfire on you-- knock you lower than where you started. jack, when you come from around here, ain't no place to go but up. jesus, man, you are one optimistic Mexican. Listen, Hec... when you go to see the loan officer on Friday... wear something nice, like a suit. Dress like a winner... be a winner. Right. - Hi,jack. - Hello, Pat. I got a pickup for Macy. Thank you. Uh-huh. Five, four, three, two, one. Hey, what the hell are you doin'? Hey, you moron! - You okay? Let me see that. - No sweat. I'm okay. Let me see it. Come on. Whoa. All right. Here, look. Put this around-- Yeah. just hold it there, okay? - So, you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Who's gonna fix your bike? - I'll take care of it. - You know how to reset a wheel? - Yeah. - No. - Don't have a bike, you don't work. You don't work, you don't get paid. There's no workman's comp. I don't need a lecture. I'll take care of it. Thank you very much. I appreciate what you've done. Okay? What are you doin'? I told you I'd take care of it. Come on, tough guy. - How come it's so empty in here? - Less to miss. This is you, isn't it? Hector said you were some kind of big head honcho once. - No one knew what you were. - Is that what Hector said? Well, you know Hector. He likes myths. What he doesn't find, he invents. Were you? - Was I what? - Were you rich? You look like you were. Oh, yeah? What does rich look like? Suntan at Christmastime. Yeah, always smiling 'cause there's nothin' ever to worry about. You know, like on TV on those commercials. They're always smiling. - What happened to all of it? - To all of what? - To all that money. - Nothing happened to it. The money's still there. It just belongs to somebody else now. If I had it, I'd never lose it. No way. You can lose anything in life. Well... there you go. Thanks. - So, you making any money? - I'm doing all right. Yeah, well, the reason I ask is... being a messenger isn't for everybody, you know. I'm doin' fine. Okay. It's just that... there are other jobs that'd be a little easier on the bones-- say, waitressing. I don't like waiting on people. I don't like touching their food. Look, Terri. Let me try to explain this, okay? There are people out there who use messengers... to do their dirty work. You know? So, it's our ass instead of theirs. - You know what I'm talkin' about? - Yeah, I do. It's cool. Okay. What are you doin'? - I'm oiling my chain. - Why? - Make it go faster. - It does? - You livin' with your folks? - No, I live with a friend of mine-- a girlfriend of mine. - Your family here in the city? - Yeah. No, actually, my parents like to travel. They're in Vegas right now. - Oh, yeah? Vacation? - No. They work there. They're singers. I don't know if you heard of'em. They're pretty famous. They open for Frank Sinatra's act. They're very close with Frank. - No kidding. - Yeah. A lot of people don't know this, but Frank is a profoundly religious man. I should know. He's my godfather. Of course, I don't remember a lot of him. I was a baby and everything. But he sends me birthday cards and Christmas cards. He's a good man. I know a lot of famous people. Let's see. Who do I know? Wayne Newton, Bobby Hackett-- they're all friends of my dad. Yeah, I think you mean Buddy Hackett. Oh, yeah. Yeah, Buddy Hackett. I get so confused sometimes. - Bobby, Buddy, you know. - Yeah, yeah. - Don't they worry about you? - No, they trust me. They know I'm okay. - How'd you do that? - It's magic, you know? Unbelievable. Ladies and gentlemen... for the first time ever, a full 360-- Hi, Rand. Terri, this is my friend, Rand. - Rand, this is Terri. - Hi. - Thanks. - Okay. See ya later.

Hey, Hector, are you gonna audition for the Four Tops? - Hey, funny. - Hey, Hec, what is this? - What are you doin'? - What? What's the matter? - The tux. Why are you wearin' a tux? - You told me to. No. I told you to wear a tux? You said wear somethin' nice. A suit, you said. - Yeah. A suit. - So, I ain't got no suit. - So, buy one. Borrow one. - From who? What money? Hey,jack, look, I blow 1 00 bucks on a suit, and what do I got? I got a crummy suit that Pee-Wee Herman wouldn't wear to his own funeral. But for 40 bucks, I got the best tux Hernando had, man. - Hernando? - Hernando. Go ahead, feel it. Come on. Touch it. Feel the fabric. This is linen. This is a 250 set of threads. - So many ruffles. - Yeah. Did I screw up? Did I do something wrong? No, no. Look-- Say you came from a wedding, okay? Say you came straight from a wedding right to the bank. - Yeah, but I-- -just do it, okay? Okay. Hey, Hec. - Good luck. - Yeah, knock 'em dead, Hector. Thanks,jack. Go get 'em.

That's right. We can. We can take a punch. And then you wanted to make me a sandwich! I tell you I've lost everything you and Mom have, and you're worried if I'm hungry or not. You know, I went out to the cab and-- I thought about what you said. And I guess I really-- I really wanted to believe it. You didn't hear me come back in, did you?
