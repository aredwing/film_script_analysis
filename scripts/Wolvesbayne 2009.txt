The first entry details Lilith, the most powerful and evil vampire to ever walk the Earth. A cruel and spiteful creature, Lilith gained control of the Vampire High Council... Premo super thee per valde ferinus. Forcing them to pay homage to her. But the vampires rebelled. They captured Lilith, and placed her on trial before the vampire elders. Too powerful to destroy outright, the vampires, led by Lord Drakulya... used the nos ferate amulus. - Guilty. - Guilty. - Guilty. - Guilty. We banished her from our world. The amulets, containing her wicked essence, were scattered around the globe. Please, I command you. For centuries, they lay dormant. Until now. Hey, Willie. What's up, man? How's it goin'? Oh, good, good, good. I'm just leavin' right now. The ship is yours. - All right, Willie. I'll see you later. - All right. Just, uh... ...lock up, on the way out. Ooh, a lucky penny. See ya. Oh shit. Hey, you can't park there. Yeah? I just did. Asshole. Be out in a second. Take your time. Just, uh... checkin' out your wares. Hi. Can I help you? Wow. Felix was right. You are gorgeous. No wonder he didn't get anywhere with you. I told your secretary, and your lackey last week that I wasn't interested. I know you did. But you didn't tell me. - Okay, I'm not interested. - Look. Due to some generous incentives by the city to clean up this area... I can offer you now ten percent more than Felix did. - I'm not interested. - And, additionally... I'm gonna give you a ten thousand dollar moving fee. Completely separate from escrow. All right, it's just something from me to you. - I'm not interested. - Alex. Ms. Layton. Ms. Layton. I've spent millions of dollars securing all the properties in the area. Save yours. The city doesn't wanna let me break ground unless I... I can prove to them that this development project is gonna work. This is my mother's shop. She left it to me. I am not gonna just give it to some... - cap - This offer is more than three times... the value of your property. You know that. With that money you can buy a house in the Garden District, - or and a vacation home. - I don't take vacations. And I don't want a house in the Garden District. Uh, you're getting in the way of progress, lady. I'm sorry. I really am. But I'm happy here. It's people like you that make capitalism needlessly difficult. You know what? Call me when you come to your senses. All right? Oh. Oh, oh. And the moving allowance... is only good for tonight. All right? At midnight, forget about it. Mr. Bayne? I think you're in danger. Excuse me? Wait, wait, wait. - Did you just threaten me? - No, I... I sense things. And... Right. The, uh... the cult bookstore psychic B.S. - But thanks though. - Seriously. I... Hey! Whoa, no, no, no, no, no. - Fellows, please, please, please. - I told you not to park there. I know. Thanks for stopping. Well, you didn't really give me much of a choice. My car, my cell phone, everything's dead. - I thought I hit somebody, but now the - Calm down. Calm down. I'll call for help for you, but I can't stick around, all right? I'm in a hurry. CarStar Center, this is Natalie Wright. How may I help you, Mr. Bayne? Uh, yes, hi. Um, there's a lady stuck on the side of the road here. - I think her car stalled. - Okay, sir. Do you have any idea what's wrong with her vehicle? Don't know, don't care. OnStar treats roadside assistance cases as emergency situations. I'll take care of this for you right away. All right. Thank you. All right. Help's on the way. All right. Thanks for stopping. Good morning, Mr. Bayne The nurse mentioned you were wakin' up. You were unconscious for forty-eight hours. How do you feel? What happened? Well, that's what we'd like to find out from you. Look at my finger. Now the police will want to speak to you. Why did I get out of the car? - Oh, my. - What? It still hurts like hell. Well, you have severe muscle damage. You'll have to have a few sessions with the physical therapist. Look, I really don't have the time to spend a couple 'a days a week... in an office full of invalids. All right, Mr. Bayne You'll need to sign a against medical advice form. Thank you. Bayne and Associates. Can I help you? Oh, oh, hi Ms. Johnson. No, I'm sorry, I haven't heard anything. Russell, are you okay? Are you doin' okay? I heard about you. Yeah, well... - I've been better. - I was so worried about you. - I tried to visit the hospital. - Did, uh... did you get those plans from the city? Yes. They're on your desk. Mr. Bayne, could you open this, please? How you feelin', boss? Hey, did that Layton woman happen to call? She's hot, right? Look, would you focus for a millisecond? Did she call? - No. - Damn it. We're gonna have to redraw all the plans... and go through that whole dog and pony show with the architects... if we don't break ground by the summer. And we're gonna lose Starbucks. They want the space on Junction. I'll deal with that. Are you sure that we've done everything? I mean... can't you slip some cash into the fire marshal's hands or... - or have her place condemned? - I've tried it all, man. She's smart, that one. And has a ridiculously perfect ass. I think she cursed me. - What? - Before I left... I think that bitch cursed me. She said that I was in danger, and then I had the accident. Mr. Bayne. Yes? Uh... Felix. I'm Detective Ladd. I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened. Yeah. Uh, please, come in. Have a seat. Thanks. So... did you know the victim? No. She, uh, she flagged my car down. I, uh, s- called for roadside assistance for her. - What attacked her and you? - I have no idea. I wish I did. It was just like, uh... it was like a coyote or a... wolf, or... a, a bear. Only he was a, bigger and, a... and faster. I'm tellin' you man, this whole thing happened so fast. Why'd you get out the car? I have no idea. S- stupidity. You know, thinkin' that I could do somethin'. Being a good Samaritan is never a bad thing. Missing two days of work and havin' an f'ed up back's a good thing? Sorry for your inconvenience. - It's fine. - Look, if you happen to... remember anything, give us a call. The direct line to the homicide department. Homicide? What, doesn't that imply murder? - Emily Van Becks was D.O.A. - Yeah, and, yeah, no kidding. That was an animal attack. Until the forensic pathologist can figure out what type of animal it was... it's with us. What do you mean? What... What you don't have some type of teeth or hair samples? Wha- I was kind'a lookin' forward to you guys tellin' me what it was. So far it's all inconclusive. None of the samples found at the scene match DNA of any known animals. So maybe you got attacked by Big Foot. Or a werewolf. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Good day, buddy. Yeah. You too. Xandrea. Zaifira. Hello, Alex. It's been a while. Not long enough. There's no need for a gun. Interestingly enough, I, I feel more comfortable with it. MacPherson. Bravo. Ease up on the gun, shall we, love? So, to what do I owe the pleasure? One of the amulets has been stolen. - The amulets? - Yes. And the clans are restless. What do you want with me? We can't confront them just yet. There's a treaty between us and the vampires in place. And since you are no longer one of us... - you're not bound to it. - I left for a reason. This is your problem. This is not mine. A world of darkness is all of our problems. I'll keep my ear to the ground. You know where to find us. With three boys running around the house all day... obviously, I don't get much time for myself. And the last thing that I wanna be doing is cleaning up after them. That's why I use Skeet - Skeet. Skeet - Skeet on the stovetop and all over the counter. You can use Skeet - Skeet in the bathroom. Skeet - Skeet on seat seat. You can Skeet - Skeet everywhere. And now a Skeet - Skeet furniture question. Damn it. What's going on? I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. - You wanted to see me? - Yeah. Yeah. Come in. Shut the door. What's up? What's that... uh, guy's name, the... problem solver? You know, when you... need somethin' to sort of disappear? Oh... Leo's guy. Oh, what's his name? - DePinto. - That's it. Uh, get me his number. - What happened? - Nothing. What did you do? Look. I just have a situation I need cleaned up, and I don't want to have to explain it to anybody - Dead hooker. It's a dead hooker. - No. If I wanted you to know, then I'd 'a had you take care of it, all right? Just get me his number. I'll be on my cell. Hello? Hey Dad. Yeah. I know. I know Stanford's a better school, but for my major. I know. Dad, you just don't understand. Okay. I know. Back for more? I'm still not interested. What'd you do to me? - How did you do that? - Get the hell out of here. - You shouldn't be able to do that. - Leave now... - or I'm calling the cops. - You're a witch. You, you did something to me. And I want you to stop. Okay, I'm not a witch. And I did nothing to you. Yes you did. You sent that thing to me, and now I am one. What'd you just say? Look, I don't need your stupid shop, okay? I promise just, just, just make it stop. - Russell, wait. - Make it stop. Oh, hey... could I get another... Damn it. I was a little disappointed you didn't want me to come over last night. It's a good thing you didn't. No, it would have been... a complete disaster. Why? Are you seeing somebody else? No. No. It's just... Have you ever... not felt like yourself? You know, like... like your whole life's changing? From the inside out? I know exactly what you're talking about. You do? Yeah. I love you too. - Go ahead, you can say it. - Oh. Hey, great. Food. Thanks. Thank you. You used to always order your steaks medium well. Oh. What an idiot. Didn't know what I was missing. You're avoiding me now. You're avoiding me, why don't you just say it? Say what? I'm an idiot. I'm, I'm sorry. Come on. Don't, don't leave. Just... Come back inside. Please. - I'm sorry. - No you're not. It's just the way you are. And that's fine. I was silly to think I could change you. All right, just please. Just come back inside. I'll see you in the office on Monday. Really? Fine. Four dogs please. - Hello. - Hey there, good lookin'. Hi. We know who you are. - How's that? - You are Russell Bayne. - Yes, I am. - Why don't you come with us? Okay. Well, is this some sort of joke or something? - Very funny Felix. - We will explain everything. Okay. Get in. - Oh, nice car. - Yeah. Um, yeah, uh... ti- I really, really, uh, need to... gotta go, I gotta go take care of my tab, all right? Uh... give me, two seconds. I swear. Um, do I need an ATM? I mean, is this one of those sort of deals? - No. Don't be silly. - It'll be fun. I'm sure it will be. Uh, look, I'll just be right back, okay? Two, two seconds. Two seconds. My car is parked out front, you're gonna wanna get in. Oh, God. - Not you again. - See your friends out there? They're bad news. I'll take my chances. Leave me alone. Hey, come on. I wanna sell. No B. S? All right, shake on it. Where is he? We tried to bring him here. She has found him and is protecting him. There was no point in turning him if he is not on our side. It is no matter. All will be complete soon enough. She may be able to protect him for a while. But no one can protect him from the Goddess. What year is it? Your majesty. We serve at your pleasure. And your service shall be rewarded. What year? You have been away for over four hundred years... - your highness. - Four hundred years. I shall make my captors pay. Many are dead. Drakulya, Ravencroft, Bathorly. All passed. The others are weak. They feed off of rats... and live in fear of the humans. Then we shall make the humans fear us. And dispose of all who stand in our way. - What the hell is goin' on? - That's what we're here to find out. The vampires want you for something. That's why they sent those two there tonight. So you're sayin' my accident wasn't an accident? There's no such thing as accidents. - Oh. You're not makin' any sense now. - Try it. Try what? Change. I can't do that. Yes you can. You're not really trying. Come on. You do it then. Come on. Lead by example. Demonstrate for me. Come on. Change. I haven't changed all the way in years. That's the point, Russ. You can control it. - How long have you been... - Nine years. - You haven't found a cure for it yet? - I don't wanna find a cure. It's a gift, Russell, it's not a curse. A gift I'd like to exchange. But you can't. Now I wanna help you. I will help you. So that you can learn to use it the way that I have. Use what? There's a lot for me to tell you. There's a world out there that very few people see. A dark world that exists side by side with the normal world. I kinda like the normal world. You've been given an opportunity, Russell. And with our gift comes many things. Powers. Responsibilities. Enemies. Well, see, th... that's exactly what I don't need. More enemies. Look. Let me explain somethin' to you. Getting in that car was the biggest mistake I ever made. I'm usually a pretty selfish prick. It's worked pretty well for me so far. You could be so much more. You're makin' me out to sound like some kinda superhero or somethin'. You are so much more. I gotta get outta here. Russell. I have progressed as far as I can without your assistance. And you have done so without our consent. Your actions will bring repercussions. Repurcussions, that will affect us all. We need not fear anyone. The goddess... The goddess cannot be controlled or trusted. That is why we disposed of her so long ago. We have peace now. Bringing her back will reignite the war with the humans. A war that we will surely win. You are forbidden from proceeding. The humans have probably already sent slayers here to kill all of us. Let them come. - All they will find is death. - We shall hear no more of this. Dare not continue with your treason, Von Griem. Am I clear? Of course. Your will... is my pleasure. My Lord. Good. - There's no time to gather the Council. - Agreed. - Eight assassins, kill them all. - Immediately. Bring me any artifacts they manage to cobble together. I'm on it. Eliminate them all. Von Griem. I don't remember inviting you in. Whoa. Oh, what a pleasant surprise. Von Griem sent you? Von Griem asked for a volunteer. Then, I... I simply couldn't resist. Your visit is about as transparent as that meeting tonight. Von Griem has already begun... the resurrection of the goddess, hasn't he? You were always smartest of the bunch. So you know why I'm here, huh? The Council isn't about to just hand over the talismans. They don't have to. Clever girl. Fortunately for you I am sympathetic to your cause. So tell me. Vlad. Where... can I find them? One, you already have. Hey. Might we have a word with you... - friend? - I'd rather not. And the other? Lord Rutherford was in love with a mortal. When she died, he had it buried along with her. Wow. And a name? Tell me a name. Oldham. Now. Tell me. What did your master instruct you to give me... in exchange for my cooperation? Death. Get the amulet. I've got this. Oh, please. Hold him. What is she doin'? What are you doin'? Bite down. This is gonna hurt. But you'll heal. - Please. Get me to a hospital. - We can't. / She's right. There's always questions. Questions that we can't answer. They'll be back. And we'll be ready. Why have so few of our kind come to my aid? We have had to work in secret. The others do not support your return. We are... outlaws. Outlaws. How can we be outlaws? Those who cower in fear of lesser beings and forces... should be the outlaws. Mm. The humans have grown in strength. They hunt us down. We are... weak. That's why we are meant to eliminate the day. When I am fully alive... and my power restored we will block out their sun. You tell them. Tell them I have returned. All of them shall follow. Or join the humans as victims of my wrath. Feeling better? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare. Uh, I don't want you to think I'm a pervert or anything. Perversion has its place. In the right context. I'm gonna take a shower. Then we can get started. Thank you... for savin' my life. No problem. Here's hoping you're not gonna have to return the favor. The first thing you're gonna have to do is control your transformation... which is gonna be difficult for you considering... how weak you were last night. Excuse me? You heard me. Look. Just 'cause we're in a similar situation, it doesn't mean I have to like you. You've been nothing but a selfish jerk off to me... since the moment that we met. - I'm sorry. - Oh. And one more thing. Any flirting that you think is going on between us... that's just me being nice. I wouldn't go for a scumbag like you in a million years. And when you stared at me this morning... that made me sick. That's good. Frustration. Aggression. That's where it comes from. Remember that feeling. The adrenaline. The increase in blood pressure. It stimulates the retro virus and forces it to become active. With training, you're gonna be able to control that. You're gonna feel the changes instead of the anger. And then... in time... you're gonna be able to do this. Jesus. See, I'm not angry. I just learned how to control it. How do I control it? Relaxation. Meditation. Just clearing your head. Again, in time this is not gonna be a problem. When the full moon comes I get a little crazy, so... pour a glass of wine, I put a Sarah McMahan CD on... and I'm good to go. Should I be taking notes here? Sarah McMahan and wine are just my thing. - Everyone's different. - Oh. Hold on. Hey Felix. Look, I, uh, I'm not gonna be comin' in to work today. It's a long... Hey. I just paid four hundred dollars for that thing. You need to focus. You're on vacation. Tell me something. How old do you think I am? Mid-twenties? I was. Nine years ago. Since then... I've been shot at, stabbed, and hit by a car goin' ninety miles an hour. So it's true? - We do live forever? - Yes and no. Some myths are true. Silver bullets impede our ability to heal. And then there's this plant. Wolvesbayne. It's like our kryptonite. Why do you have it? Because... I've been working on an antidote. If you're lucky, on contact, that stuff will kill you. What if it doesn't kill you? Uh, how did you learn how to do all this? An old friend. Where's he? He's dead. They killed him. - The vampires. - Yeah, uh, what's the deal with them? I think that's enough back story for today. Before you leave here... I wanna see you do the little stunt that I just did. - Yeah. For real? - Mm-hmm. All right. I'll try. No, you're not gonna try. You're gonna do it. Damn, you're bossy. Okay. Come on, impress me. All right. I will not wait any longer. Gather a company and fetch me the human. I want him tonight. Yes, master. Fascinating... isn't she? She worries me, master. How so? You heard the Council. They said she could not be trusted. Because she cannot be controlled. Their lust for power... and control... clouds their objectivity. But, if we do this... how do we know she will not turn on us? They have rumors that she tried to enslave the entire planet. Legends. Stories to frighten vampires before they go to sleep in the morning. No more. With her... we will be unstoppable. It has begun. What happened to him? Well, he's just a little tired from his first workout. I fell off the ceiling. Where's the amulet? - What? - Don't be stupid with us. - I know you have it. - We're running out of time. I would love to help you if I knew what the hell you were talkin' about. He doesn't know. Yeah. He doesn't know. Your great grandfather, Eric Bayne, was one of us. Entrusted with one of the talismans that the vampires now seek. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. Ho- uh. My grandfather and his best friend Lou Slawner... they, they own a bakery in Milwaukee. After he retired... he fought the undead for over forty years. He wouldn't just misplace it. So... think very hard, Russell. Where is it? The heirlooms. My dad left me this old box. It had, had a bunch of old papers and land deeds... and assorted artifacts. It's in there. Where exactly is there? The, uh, the Deltalands National Bank in a safety deposit box. Good. It stays there. Do you have an address? The vampires are being difficult as usual. Most of the higher-ups have fled the city. One remains. Vlad Arau. Who, who exactly are you guys? Sadie MacPherson. And this is Jacob Van Helsing. Van Helsing. I've heard that name before. There are six amulets. Magical talismans... that were used to put her into a state... of suspended animation four hundred years ago. - Who is her? - Lilith. The first of their kind. The vampire's Eve. The most powerful of them all. As vampirism spread, they began to organize themselves into clans. To protect and control the populations. Lilith demanded they pay homage to her. She had aspirations of creating a world of darkness. Where humans were bred like cattle for food. That sounds like a good deal for them. I mean, why would they want her gone? 'Cause not all vampires are bad. Some just want their immortality. To be left alone. They saw her as a menace to be destroyed. They couldn't kill her outright. She was too powerful. Oh. So you guys... you're professional vampire hunters? They hunt all creatures of the night. Including us. Only when we step out of line. They need the six talismans to resurrect their queen to its full power. They believe this Vlad character has one of them. The other two are disappeared. We know where one is. So we're one step ahead. Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second? Russell. Look. - You're not ready to fight. - Oh no. I can do this. No. Today was good, but you need a lot more practice. Hey, I'm all about on the job training. Come on. Let's, let's just do it. Hey. These guys are professional assassins. There's only nine of them in the world at a time... because that's all that they need. The entire vampire world, scared to death of them. - So, we're in good hands, right? - No. Look. They're ruthless. They are fixated on their mission and they are not going to protect us. Look, I don't really have a choice, all right? The vampires are gonna come after me. Just have my back. Shall we? - Hey, hey, what are you, what the hell? - You're not ready. Wha... you just said... Guess I lied. Hey... Hey... Sorry, mate. Come on. Hello. You should have come with us the other night. You would have had such a good time. All bark, no bite. Don't worry. A day late and a dollar short. No. Hey, toots. You're connected to two blood IVs. One is clean blood. The other is hers. She is an immune. Her blood is poison to your system. You tell me what I need to know and I'll be merciful. I'll allow you to regenerate, and after all this is over... I'll set you free. So predictable. Enjoy. Can't watch this. The poison is slow acting. The pain will go on for minutes. Days. Weeks. Months if I choose Or, you can cooperate. And tell me what I want to know. I will tell you nothing. Look around. The goddess grows in power. The sun will not rise tomorrow. Because she commands it. We will rise in power... and you will live as our slaves. Tell me what I need to know... and then I'll be merciful and let you live. Then we'll send your goddess back to where she belongs. 'Cause no one's enslaving anyone. Not on my watch. - These guys are no joke, huh? - No, they're not. Sometimes I think they actually enjoy their job. The other day... I didn't tell you the entire truth. About the man who taught me everything I knew. His name was Templeton. I was young. We fell in love. He was a slave for the vampires. Countess Bathorly was his mistress. When she died... he was set free. So he went to work for the vampire hunters. There was a war... between the vampires and the humans. They found a way to control him. Hunters killed him in his sleep. And that's why I don't trust them. Sounds like they might not have had a choice. We all have choices. The paths that we walk, they're ours, and ours alone. Is there any way for them to do this to us? To turn us against the hunters? Or each other? Give me a name. A name. Oldham. Oldham. What's the name again? Oldham. They captured and tortured me. I waited as long as I could. But they were gonna kill me. I told them where to find it. What was I supposed to do? Die? It's here. We'll cover you. Jacob Van Helsing. I should thank you for saving me some valuable time. - It's not here. - She's right, you know. I promise you. Your deaths shall be swift. You're nothing if not a... worthy adversary. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, shall we? Give to me what is mine. Sure you want it? Then I think we should give it to them. Right. You are immune but not immortal. Silver bullets, bitch. Bring me the final talisman or the others will die. Their blood shall be on your hands. Jacob. They took her. Now would be a good time to call your backup. I always wanted a pet. You need to be good or you're not gonna have any treats. You're quite amusing. I think I'll kill you last. Your killing days are over. Soon you will be one of us. You're almost as funny as your girlfriend. You will not be immune to the bite of the goddess. Something to look forward to. I was hoping to just shoot you in the face... with a forty-five and stake you to the ground. I will not allow that. You're going to stop me? No, my little one. You will call me master, you will do my bidding. Only if your bidding includes killing you and all your friends. I think not. But you and I are going to have some issues, love. You... will soon see the wisdom of our ways. How do we know where they are? One of my cohorts pressured the Vampire Council... into telling them where they are. That'd be him. Downtown. The River Run Movie Theater. Closed down in nineteen seventy-seven. Last thing they showed there was Star Wars. Ever since then it's been a bloodsucker hangout. Russell. I'd like you to meet Jimmy the Kid. - We call him The Kid. - Come on man, we talked about this. It's not The Kid. It's Jimmy. It's Jimmy. - Let me guess. You're the werewolf? - That's right. Do me a favor buddy. Keep your distance. I got one eye on them, and one eye on you. But I got silver bullets too. - With your name on 'em, pal. - Whoo. Come on. - Ignore whatever he says. - We usually do. - Who's The Kid? Let's go. I'm drivin'. Von Griem tells me that you were captured. - And tortured. - Yes. I had no choice but to tell them. But I told Von Griem immediately where to find them. I see. Yet, you... jeopardized... everything... because of your weakness. - I did... - The type of weakness... that will not be tolerated in the new world. - In my world. - Yes, your highness. Is it better to... try to teach her... - or to try to use her as an example? - Your Highness, may I suggest... How dare you? Your Highness. She was a member of my clan. Your clan? Your clan no longer exists. All of you shall follow me. I will lead us in this new millennium of darkness. I am their leader as I am yours. Do not dare... challenge my decisions. Child of the night. We're not so different. Yeah. Bring me the other one. Are you ready my child? Ready to become my servant? Ready... and willing. Von Griem. Van Helsing. Release them. And I will give you this. You are in a position to ask for nothing. Kill him. Bring me the amulet. Shall we give it a go? Try not to get too excited. The stake's in my back pocket. What have you got now, Van Helsing?
