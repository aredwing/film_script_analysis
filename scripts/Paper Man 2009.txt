That's the great thing about it Just whatever's Ieft laying around, you know. You can take all the crap that's rotting in your fridge and throw out, or you could toss it into a pot and make soup out of it So l go with soup. - [slurping] Oh. lt's superb. - Thank you. - No, really. lt's excellent - Do you remember the moment when you reaIized that soup didn't have to come out of a can, you know, like all manufactured, that your chicken noodle couId kick Campbell's chicken noodle's ass any day of the week? - I think I'm having that moment right now. - [chuckles] Plus, it's very nutritious, which is good. - Whatwhat happened there? - Oh. Sorry. It's just it's a boyfriend thing. Just, um, the bird kind of reminded me of him. He's chickenshit - Oh. Actually, it's not a chicken. lt's the North American heath hen. Related to the greater prairie chicken, but not technically a chicken. - Oh. - lt's extinct now. The last few lived out here out on the nature preserve at Camp Hero. - Hmm. l did not know that - l'm not a birder or anything. lt's just, the last surviving heath hen is a character in... - ln what? - That bird's just it's the main character of this book that, you know, l'm attempting to produce, to write, finish. Actually, to start. Saying it out loud just sounded kind of stupid. -Well, there's Chicken Little, you know, and Little Red Hen. - Henny Penny. - Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Oh, you know, there's a lot of books out there about poultry. [laughter] - We should settle up. - Okay. - ls that about right? - Actually, l'm $12 an hour. - Oh, okay. l only have a $10. Do you have change? - Let me check. - So how come your boyfriend's a chickenshit? None of my business. Sorry. - No, he just He just bugs. You know, it's like when he's with me, it's all, "Oh, you know." And when he's with his friends, he's all, "Ugh, whatever." lt's justyou know, he's a fucking chickenshit - Right - Okay, so thank you. - Mmm-hmm. Thank you. Can l ask you a quick question? - Sure. - Does this couch make me look fat? - l wouldn't sit there. - Hmm. - So okay. Good luck with the chicken book. - Same time next week? - Um... Okay. - You didn't tell me your name. [door creaking] - Richard? Richard. - Are we separated? - What? - ls this a trial separation, what we're doing? - What makes you think that? - l don't know.

[both moaning] - Why you got to wear so much shit? - 'Cause it's freezing in here. Run the heater. - You want to pay for the gas? [grunting] - Are you done? - [sighing] Yeah. [moaning] See you later. [engine turns over] [rock music blaring] [buzzing] - Okay. - Well, just go for it - ll l'm going. [buzzing] Okay, well, he's dead now. Why don't you go? Damn it lt's your turn. l don't know how you do this all day. l mean, there's so much pressure. - Well, it's just a game. - l know. - No one's dying here. - Go ahead. - We can play something else. - No, it's fine. lt'syou know. - All right Let's see.

[engine turns over] - [humming quietly] What? You're standing. Oh. Really? [groans] [exhaling deeply] That's enough of that You remember when you stuck that dime up your nose and tried to snort it out your mouth? The cowboy outfit for your seventh grade school picture? You remember? The horny toads, the hunger strike? l cautioned you against those decisions, but you didn't listen to me, which is fine, 'cause you were just a kid. But now it's grow-up time. The babysitter? Bad, Richard. Very, very bad, Richard. That chair's gonna be a problem. - Sakes alive. [sighs] - "Making the monkey. "A humorous monkey is popular in zooIogicaI gardens. "For exampIe, it is IoveIy that you make a baby monkey "with small paper and that you put it on a mother monkey. Fold A, top right corner." - Why origami? Why now? - l needed something to do with my hands. - l'm having trouble telling which is the monkey and which is the swan. [knocking at door] - Oh, that can't be all of them. - No, no, there's a bunch more in the truck. - Oh, great Start bringing them in. Horton r [knocking at door] - Richard, Richard, for the Iove of God, don't do this please. Listen to me. You're making a huge mistake. You're going for it - lt's Abby. My name. Oh, you got rid of the couch. - Yeah, the couch was a problem. - [chuckles] Um... This is for you. - Oh. lt's... it's a fish. A dead fish. A whole dead fish. - Yeah. My dad fishes, like, for a living. lt's a fluke. - ln what sense? - lt's called a fluke. lt'sthe water around here is swimming with them. - Ah, yeah. So it's edible? - Yeah. - A fluke. That's great Thanks. - So l read that book you wrote. l hope that's okay. - Reading my book? Of course. You may be one of the few. - So are you going out tonight? Out on the town? - Uh, l don't know. What do the people of Montauk do on a Friday night? - The Yardarm's totally dead. So you'd probably like that lt's down by the harbor. You can't miss it - What did you think of the book? - l don't know. What did you think of it? - Me? Oh, l you know, it's got its strengths, got its moments. l hate it - You should probably put that fish in the fridge, 'cause it'll stink up the whole house. Trust me. I know. What? - Soup ingredients. You know, if you feel like it - You bought me a rutabaga. - [chuckles] - You're making this too easy on me. - Well, like l said, you know, if you feel like it No pressure. - Your book was cool, actually. lt kind of blew me away. [bass-heavy rock music] - You planning on having something to eat? - Thanks, no. l've got soup at home: homemade. - Can't beat that Another beer? - Sure. - So what brings you down to the South Shore, then? - A book. A bird. A book about a bird. Research work, you know. - My wife makes a good chowder. Not so much a clam chowder Iike you'd expect, more of a corn chowder. - My Lorraine, she can shuck a dozen oysters in a minute and a half. - Local Malpeque oyster? - That's the one. - My wife invented and patented a Iifesaving poIymer shunt - Shunt, you say? - Shunt So there's our heath hen, hunkered down at Camp Hero. - Just down the road here? - Yep. As game warden - The Alfred guy. - Yeah, correct Alfred is his actual name. In the book, I am going to call him Horton or Morton. Anyway, so he's brought his flock of heath hens back from the brink of extinction. - Awesome. - l mean, he was down to 1 1 of them. 1 1, you know, but now with care, and dare I say, Iove, and incubators, he's got 200. And it's like the hen is saved. - Safe, thank God. - But because our story is a tragedy, you know what happens? - What? - Fire. - No! - Come on! - Oh, yeah, it sweeps across the preserve. Of course, the heath hen, not nature's most intelligent bird to begin with... - l hear ya. - She just sits in her nest You know, and she doesn't have the sense to run or fly or waddle. You know, when the fire runs out, there's just five birds remaining. - Roast chicken. - What happens to the five? - They dwindle. They dwindle till there's just one left, you know? Just one. Just one poor stupid little thing. You know, it's just a stupid bird. Just one. lt's a true story. - Another round for my friend here, Mike. - Chicken shit Oh, you did make soup. Bless your heart.

[groaning] - Okay. Look, it's gonna be 60 bucks. Okay, you should go to bed. - l don't blame her, the doctor. You know, she's just she's a human mechanic. You know, she's got her hands inside human beings every day. They're just machines to her, you know. They're machines that break, like rot factories. So how can you create life when you know it's gonna end up in death? l mean, l get that l get it! l don't blame her, but - Hey, l'm sorry. - Eh. See, she doesn't realize that human beings are warm. You know, they need contact They need, you know you are such a beautiful girl. You are such a beautiful child. thud! No, no! thud! [groaning] [dishes crashing] - Shit - [groaning] - l'm gonna go.

The juice. - You mean the broth? - Right, right, and then it just needs some cooking. [clears throat] - Richard, is anything wrong? l'm not l'm concerned. - Oh, weII, thank you for your concern, Claire. Speaking of... how are your patients? Are they doing well? And what are some of their names? - You know, you've got a bruise right here. - Oh, well, you know, beaten down by life. You know, winds of change. Anyway, l want to do some unIoading of boxes if you want to pitch in. Then we can grab some brunch. - Oh, no, Richard, no. Are these all - Oh, yes. - Why? Why would you do that to yourseIf? - Well, l just thought as I embarked on the writing of my second my much anticipated second novel, that l should be reminded of the remarkable, l mean, really quite noteworthy failure of my first noveI to seII any copies whatsoever. - Richard, l can't go down this road with you. - No, no, no, it's gonna be very motivationaI, reaIIy. - That was smooth. - Hey, l got through it - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait - What? - My super senses are telling me something. - What? - Yes.

What the hell is she doing? - l don't think l got a chance to pay you the other night How's $60? - Keep it You don't even have a kid, so [horn honking] - l think there was kind of a misunderstanding about some of my actions or intentions. I'm pretty sure l said some things. - Whatever. I'm sure you're sorry that you said all that stuff. - l'm not sorry, actually, about all that What l'm sorry about is that l was so abrupt at the house. lt was just - Your wife was there.

You know, it wasn't enough for him to save mankind. He needed a trade. I'm a fIimsy man, an insubstantial. - Well, compared to Jesus. - l'm a paper man. - No, you're a writer. - Yeah, that's crucial. - No, it is. Here we are.

And she was laughing, and, you know, fine. And then she was... And then she was gone. Just under and gone. And l just stood there. And then a couple hours later my mom came and found me. And l guess, you know, l was waiting for her to swim back in. But she never did. - How old? - Same age as me. We're twins. - Oh. Oh, my God. - That was a long time ago. l like to go out there every year and swim back to shore.

You shouldn't just assume l'll always be around, 'cause one day maybe l won't - Stop it - ls that what you want? - l don't have much of a story, do I? - lt's all relative, l suppose. - Exactly.

Richard, say something. - [stammering] - [sighs] What's this? - What's what? - This. Whose is this? - Will you just tell her? - Claire? - Yes? - Are we unhappy, or are we just pretending to be unhappy? - What do you mean? - Are we just pretending to be unhappy to add drama to our lives so that we seem somehow more substantial? l mean, think about it Our lives are embarrassingly easy. We've got plenty of money. We got friends. Well, you've got friends. There are people out there who have real problems, you know, real reasons to be unhappy. l mean, l could be a coal miner dying of black lung or something. You could be a Cincinnati crack whore on food stamps. - What? - l don't know. Doesn't it feel like we're faking it, our unhappiness? - No. No, it's real. lt's very real. l'm going home now. l think you think this is still charming. We're not 23 anymore.

You son of a bitch! - Don't overreact here. - Shut up. Don't tell me how to react - lt's not like that - Shut up! What is this, Richard? What who is that? Who the fuck is that? - She's the babysitter. - Get out Get out Get out! - Hi, Lucy. Hi, Peter. - Hi. Claire, we'll just be - l didn't sleep with the babysitter, if that's what you're thinking. - Oh, that's so comforting. Why do we even have a babysitter? - lt's just a kegger, Claire. That's all. - Just a kegger? And with whom exactIy did you have a kegger? - Just some kids from the high school. - Richard, just stop. None of this is okay. - Okay. - You knew we were coming this weekend. Why are you doing this? - l've been at a bit of a loss. - That's a bullshit answer. - l've been floundering, and Abby has been - What? Abby's been what? - A friend. - For God's sake. That's not a friend; that's a child. You have friends. - No, l don't - Do think that was a chipmunk that we hit? - l think they hibernate. - Yeah. - 'Cause you don't know how to relate to other human beings. Yeah, you isolate yourself. - Oh, you could talk. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - You can be cold, Claire. - Let's just maybe get out of here. Can we just get out of here? Can we Ieave this area? - What do you mean by that? - l don't know if it's your profession or what [both muttering] But it's made you hard. - l can't l don't accept that - l wanted to have a baby. - Is that what this is all about? - We could have had a baby, CIaire. Why didn't we have a baby? - Why? Because you are a baby! You're an infant You still have an imaginary friend. - l just wanted a little warm thing, something simple I couId start with, a single relationship with a person that was new and pure, where I couId be me and they could be them, and that was aII that was expected. And we could build this world where there was someone else other than me to think about and be about, the relief of being able to give the worId to someone eIse and just let it be theirs, let them have their turn, so it doesn't end with me. - Well, that's all you. Where do l come in? - What do you mean? God, you're the mother. - Uh, l'm so sorry, you guys. But we're gonna go. We're just gonna go. - B&B just anywhere? Anywhere. - l'm sorry. - No, it's fine. - No, no, no, no, no. - We're just gonna - Okay, l'll walk you out - We should all go on a cruise or something. - Okay. - Take care. - All right, if we're gonna do this, let's all right, by the way, what is she, like, 13, 14? Let's at Ieast get our facts straight, though. Okay, it was you, Richard. You didn't want to have a baby. You weren't ready. So that little fuzzy fucking speech my friends had to hear was bullshit And now l'm l can't So l guess l'm the bad guy. - No, not the novel. Look, l'd rather you didn't - What is this? What is this? - That's it - After all this time out here, this is it? This? Maybe if you'd spent more time working instead of fucking the babysitter - No. - You're useless. - Yes. - You're totally useless. - Yes, l am. - What is wrong with you? - l don't know what to do with my hands! - [sighs] - Everyone: Jen and my sister and Liv all envied me. l had the one who made me laugh. What happened? l don't know what happened. - You stopped laughing. [squeaking] [morose vocal and guitar music] - Help you? - Yeah, l came to pay my respects. - Sorry? - The heath hen, the North American heath hen. This is where the last one lived, died. - Oh. l wouldn't know anything about a heath hen. But you're welcome to Iook around. We've got several varieties of pIover. - Thank you. [bittersweet acoustic guitar music] So this is what the end of something looks like. - The world went on, Richard. - But never the same. Who knows how she might have changed things with herjust being here, the rippIe effect - And if that chicken hadn't died out, you'd be perfectly well adjusted. - Maybe. - Doubtful. - Instead, l'm a childless loser. l'm condemned to oblivion, Captain, just Iike our IittIe hen. lt's time for you to go. - No. - You know what l'm saying, Captain. I mean, go and never come back. - l'm not ready. - lt doesn't matter. You can't help me anymore. The doctor's right - But you'll be all alone. - Yes. Last of my kind. Okay. Do the voice one last time. Please. - When the world is in peril, when evil surrounds you, when danger is lurking... [whispering] Who do you call? - Captain Excellent [triumphant music] - [sighs] [sobbing quietly] [knocking at window] [window whirring] - I wish I had a really amazing fucked-up father like him. [window whirring] [engine turns over] [typewriter whirring] - Captain. [typewriter whirring] Richmond regarded his solitude Merton regarded Horton regarded [Richard's voice overlapping] [whispering] Richmond? Richmond? Richard. Richard regarded his solitude as something sacred. [typewriter keys clacking] - l had this dream last night And you were in it - Oh, was l interesting? - You were you. You're leaving, aren't you? - Yeah, you know, 'cause of the situation. - Yeah. l figured. You know, spring is my favorite time, 'cause summer people aren't here yet lt's not so fucking cold. - Yeah. Um, l made you something. - That's the swan. The beautiful, graceful swan. It's Richard, it's perfect - Yeah, well... - Thank you. - lt seems like we were just getting started. - Here. - Got to find a way back home - Okay. [bittersweet music] - Got to find a way to get home strong Got to find a way back home - [laughs quietly] - Got to find a road that brings me back soon Got to find a way back home Got to find a way to get home strong Got to find a way back home [stirring rock music] - Never wanted to feel this way l never wanted to feel so sad - [sobbing] - Never wanted to feel this way again - Okay. - l'm a horse's ass. - Yes, you are. - l'm sorry. l'm gonna need some help getting this couch in. - Got to find a way to get home strong Got to find a way back home Richard regarded his solitude as something sacred, as a well-earned badge of honor, a cloak to be worn to ward off life, as his safety. Solitude is who he was. This caused those in his life to view him with a barely veiled contempt. Richard was certain that he was not liked, which is hard on a man. Maybe it was because he gave nothing that he received nothing in return. ln any case, his situation had become intolerable. The closest things he had to friends were either imaginary or extinct. Richard had reached a point in his life where this was no longer enough. And then he met a girl, and she was warm, and she was sad, and she was maybe lonely in a way that reminded him of himself. She'd lost things that a girl should never have lost. And she knew things, and she taught him. And Richard thought, "Maybe this is what friendship feels like. Maybe." lt was just a glimpse. They'd barely begun, really. But in those long few winter days, she'd given him so much, enough so that Richard could go on. And what had he given her? Just a few words on a page. Not much, perhaps. But for Abby, he hoped it was enough. [gull cawing] [bittersweet music] - Got to find a way to get home strong Got to find a way back home Got to find a light to guide me home Got to find a way back home - Okay. - Got to find a way back home [wistful rock music] - l broke the door l broke the furniture l painted pictures Did it for you Oh, ho Oh, oh l said good-bye To my whole family l hope they'll miss me As much as you [bright acoustic guitar music] - Driftwood finds its way to sand So l'm sure that we will Recognize our landmark soon Wanderlust has lost its shine lt's left me cold, and we're running out of time As we wonder how much longer we can keep Our cars in tune And I onIy know that I'II never be the boy wonder Yeah, l only know that l'll never be the boy wonder It's too Iate for that sort of thing now Maybe l'll just cut my losses in this city That is how we say "surrender" Driftwood finds its way to sand And they're wondering if they'll somehow see a grandson soon And I onIy know that I'II never be the boy wonder It's too Iate for that sort of thing now Maybe l'll just cut my losses in this city That is how we say "surrender" [humming] Now if l get carried away, l'll get plowed under So I can't forget that I'II never be the boy wonder l'm too gray And l'm too beat down l could just come to my senses then retire to some smaII town And just surrender Driftwood finds its way to sand So l'm sure that we will Recognize our landmark soon
