Oh, boy. - Not at all. - No. Did anyone do the reading last night? Absolutely not. Mm-hmm. Actually, I read it twice. Okay. Okay, after we, uh, take the quiz, we'll go over the practice A.P. essays from last week. Please pass these down. Oh, sure. Lanie, if you would pass these down. Were the essays any better this time? They were, actually. I was very impressed. Good. All right. So... There are four questions on the quiz. A few sentences each, please. So, about a half a page? Yes. Right. Five lines, or should we do six lines? Let's just say half a page, all right? Smart-ass. Okay, it's 8:20 now, so at 8:30, you may use your books. At 8:40, pencils down. Please begin. Lanie, I love you. Can I borrow a book, please? You may. Thank you. Ah. Oh. Oh. Ugh. That was horrible. Yeah, it's the worst. Who are you texting? What? Who was that? Who was that? Nothing. Did I see the name Eric? Nope. Have I met Eric? Nope. And... He's nothing. Uh-huh. Where did you meet Eric? Ooh. At school. Nice. Very nice. Mmm. Have you seen the girls? Hello, madam. Oh. Hello. Um... shall we? Later, gator. Where you going? Hi. Hi. Oh, my God. When I was in high school, I used to go to have sex with my boyfriend in his car, and I'd tell my mom that I was going to get ice cream. Then I'd come back a couple hours later... with my hair all fucked up. I can't believe... She must have known. She never seemed to know. I should go. Hey, when do you get back? Uh, tomorrow. Night, I think. Late? Um, yeah. I can't wait. Okay, everyone. Have a fantastic Thanksgiving. Don't forget to do your reading. Catch up to chapter nine. All right. Thanks for the advice. Have a great Thanksgiving. You too. And what can I do for you? Would you also like to start a club? Maybe the make-out club? Shh. When are you leaving for Houston? Tomorrow. Hmm. Call me later? I will. Bye, Miss Watts. Have a happy Thanksgiving. You too, Mr. Tull. Yeah. I've got one in the mix this time. - She's a good student. - What are you all whispering about? Oh, we're talkin' about those kids who got busted smoking weed in the parking lot. Yeah, and the girl Hayley? She's in my A.P. Comp class. Her mom's just gonna bail her out anyway, so... Well, yeah, she might. Hey, we're gonna go for a drink after work. - You wanna come with us? - Oh, my brother's in town. I promised him I'd meet him for a drink, so... You never mentioned you had a brother. I know. I'll see you guys later. Have a good break. Yeah, you too. See you. Thanks. Hey, Diana. It's Hunter. Uh, I'm gonna be in Austin for a meeting. I know it's been a long time, but, uh, we need to talk about Mom. Um, you can't just avoid this forever. Okay? Call me. Di. Hunter. Hey. So how's everything? It's good. Mom's good too. She doesn't always recognize me, but, uh, she asks about you. I'm worried about you. Okay. Look, I just, um... You need to know... You know, I'm really... It was really nice of you to call. Hang on. This has been really fun, but I've got to go now. You can get that. I'm sure you can expense it or something. Sure. I don't wanna go. I just wanna stay here. Just stay the night. Leave early in the morning before Dad gets up. I don't mean right now. I mean this. Us. Hmm. I'm trying to tell you something. Okay. What did you wanna say? You smell really good. That's what you're trying to tell me? Yep. That was it. This is the happiest I've been in a long time. You know what really makes me happy? What's that? This. Does your family do like a fancy Thanksgiving, or... Oh, no, not my family. Can you imagine my dad being fancy? Um, but I am gonna introduce you to some high school friends... at this party that I go to every year, so bring something really cute for that. There's this guy, Dan... I think he's someone you should meet. And Rich, who's unemployed right now. But anyway, they're both really cute... and I don't know... I dated both of them a long time ago. But I just think... I think that either of them could be great for you. I mean, Dan is probably particularly great... because he is currently not unemployed, and he's really creative, and he's got a couple of Web properties, um, so, you know, kind of a keeper... someone you could see yourself going out with. So, when we were in high school, actually, he, uh, did this crazy thing... - Did you hear what I just said? - No. I'm sorry. I haven't been listening. Are you kidding me? I'm sorry. Okay. Super casual for Thanksgiving. Bring something cute because I'm taking you to a party to meet some men. Okay? Oh, wow. I don't have anything like that. Something cute. You could wear a paper bag, and you'd be cute. But don't. Something else. So... what were you saying? Done, yeah. This is definitely offensive. It might be offensive, but I think it made a lot of money. So what? From who? I don't know. Anyway... Oh, this is my lovely roommate Diana, guys. Hi. Dan. This is Dan. Hi. Diana. Good to meet you. How do you do? Jeff. Jeff? Diana. Nice to meet you. Do you want a beer? I'm good. Uh, yeah. Sure. Okay. I'm gonna get you a beer. Both of you. Uh, so you're the... the teacher? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Uh, Sophia was telling me about that. Cool. What do you do? I run this Web site called LOL poorpeople. com. I run a boring Web site. Hey. Hi. I'm Rich. Who are you? This is, uh, uh, Diane. Hi, Diane. Hi. Diana. Um... Diana. Okay, sorry. Yeah. I'm Sophia's roommate. What do you... She's a teacher. Okay. Yeah. I teach English. High school English. Oh. She is totally the teacher that all the little dudes in high school... wanted to bang, but they couldn't bang her in high school. No. No? Sorry. Shit. There's a hair in my beer. I'll be right back. There's a hair in your beer? Yeah. Hey. Hey. How much longer do you think you wanna stay? A little while. You wanna stay? Wanna go? I do. I'm just really tired. Um, you wanna take my car? - Could I? - Yeah. You can totally take it. Yeah, I can give you a ride back. That would be great. This is the key to the car, and that's the key to the house. Okay. All right. Yeah. See you later. Nice to meet you. See you at home. Okay. Be back soon. Hey, it's Eric. Leave me a message, and I'll call you back. Hey. It's me. I miss you. Bye. - Do we really have to keep watching this? - Yes. Dad. Yes. Hey. It makes him happy. Okay. Let him be happy. Fine. - I'll go put my feet up for a minute. - Okay. Oh, no. This is such a good play though. Really? Right here? Uh, no. In a few more. It's not really that good. You should go. I thought I'd find you in here. Whose picture was that? Uh, just Facebook. Yeah? Been on that phone an awful lot, missy. Mm-hmm. You're not trying to escape, are you? 'Cause I would like to escape from these crazy people... that are my family. Oh, they're so sweet. Well, they think you're great. They're so glad you're here. And I'm really glad that you're here... and not alone. You're well-fed, and it's good to spend the holiday with you. My family just loves you. Our house is your house. Just sleeping in a couple more minutes. It's just wonderful. I know. Hey, have you, uh... Have you seen that photo that's going around school? Apparently, it's a topless photo... of a freshman girl. God. I mean, a student's phone was confiscated, and the new assistant principal found it. Oh. What was she thinking? I mean, kids... They can do things that are so stupid. I mean, that's really dumb. Yeah. Phones are everywhere. Everybody will send that to everyone. It was a freshman? Yeah. Yeah, she's a freshman. I don't have her, but, um, I think Irene has her. So. But... I hope her parents don't see that. That would just be... That'd be so sad. Oh, my gosh. By the way, I totally forgot. I meant to ask you sooner. Is there any way you can help me chaperone the Sadie Hawkins Day dance? Please? I need, like, three more people. Oh. Really. It could be fun. I've managed to get out of doing that the whole time I've been here. Please, come on. Oh. Um... Who else is chaperoning? Um, Tony... and, uh... now, Irene... She never got back to me on it. Oh, gosh. I really need your help. I need to get, like, three more people. Yeah, I'll do it. Yeah, it's fine. I'll do it. You owe me, but... I'm there. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. Mm-hmm. That'll be great. It'll be fun. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It will. Mm-hmm. Hey. I need you to delete that photo from your phone. Okay. No, I need you to do it now. Done. Thanks. Is it about that girl? Yeah. It just made me really nervous. You have a good Thanksgiving? Yeah. It was good. You? It was all right. Can I, uh... Can I come see you tonight? Yeah. My roommate's out of town still, so just come on over. All right. What's up, man? Yo, what's up, bro? How you doin'? Good. What about you? Good, man. You boys stay out of trouble, all right? You hungry? Yeah, dude. Let's grill. Let's roll. ...the police department now wants the city... So, I got pulled in to chaperoning the Sadie Hawkins dance. Oh, yeah? This girl actually asked me to the dance today. Really? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Yeah? Figured, uh, I should go, you know, just so people don't get suspicious or anything. Yes? So, I have to watch you dance with some girl? Mmm. Are you jealous? I kind of like it. Does that mean that you're going with her? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Don't worry. It doesn't mean anything. Just goin' with her. The regular deadline for U.T. applications are coming up. Has everyone gotten their waivers who is planning on getting a waiver? Does anyone need any help with that? Good? We all good? Good to go. There's also A.P.'s. You want to start thinking about which A.P.'s you're gonna wanna take, which exams. You're gonna wanna sign up for that. How long is the exam? How long is each exam? The exam. Um... I think it's three hours. Okay. Just don't take it. My sister said it was like two... All right. What else? Um, do we have any announcements? Student relations? Um, if anybody wants to help clean up after the dance... Forget it, Lanie. Lanie, no one's gonna clean up after the dance. We love you, Lanie. Is everyone going to the dance? - No. - Oh, yeah. Are you chaperoning? Um, I do not know. You should. We shall see. s that freshman gonna be there? Lanie, are you gonna invite me to the dance? In your dreams. I asked that freshman.

I know. - You think it's gonna be raining at the ranch? - Nah. Still got a long ways to go, and it's moving out. It'll be good. Mmm. I've never been to a ranch before. Really? We don't have them on the East Coast. Right. How long have you been in Texas? Four years. You've never been to a ranch? No one I know has one. Wow. Lucky for you, I do. Hmm! Hey.

Do you think it's gettin' bigger? I think it's gettin' bigger. I mean, I don't know about you, but I mean, what do you think? I mean, it's stronger, you know? I think it's kind of...
