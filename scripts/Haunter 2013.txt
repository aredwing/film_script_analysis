Hey, watch out for blinky, okay? He always traps you on your left. Don't! Lisa, you messed up my game! Here's your walkie. Stop waking me up with it, brat. Edgar left it, not me. Well, tell Edgar he's annoying. You tell him. He's your imaginary friend. He's not imaginary. Lisa, go down to the basement and start the laundry, will you? I did it yesterday, you just don't remember me doing it. Stop being a smart aleck. Buster brown, where's your glasses? I lost them. Well, find them, pronto. Lisa, have you decided where we're gonna go for your birthday tomorrow? Ask me tomorrow. Okay. Well, I hope we get there, 'cause the car's not running. Your dad's been trying to fix it all day. He won't fix it. Laundry, please. Cold water only. The hot wears out the clothes. I don't think it's possible for our clothes to wear out, ever. Cold water. Lisa. Not a smart idea to go anywhere today, pal, with all this fog. Stay inside, okay? Play some games with Robbie or practice your clarinet. I'm sure everyone else in the neighborhood is staying inside today, too. Even the phones are out. Something wrong Lis? Hmm? No. No. Everything's fine. I mean, you wouldn't believe me anyway so... This is the story of Peter and the wolf. Early one morning, Peter opened the gate and went out into the big, green meadow. Lisa! Come downstairs, will you? Your father and I want to have a talk. Your mom says you've been acting kind of funny all morning. Funny how? Well, for one thing, some clothes are missing from the laundry. Do you know where they are? Honestly, I really don't know where they went. The truth is, they're gone every day. And what does that mean, "gone every day"? Okay, it's like mom's pancakes. Every morning, she makes them for breakfast, and you're always trying to fix the car, which for some mysterious reason has always stopped running. Then, Mac and cheese for lunch. Then, we have meat loaf for dinner every night. And at 8:00, we watch, "murder, she wrote" and go to bed, wake up tomorrow, and do the exact same thing. Well, you and Robbie have school tomorrow, and I have work, so... There is no school. There is no work. And what about your birthday? That's not tomorrow either? No. Never comes. It's always the day before I turn 16. It's pretty frustrating. I'm really trying to understand where this is all coming from, pal. Are... are you bored with your life? Is that it? I mean, are you anxious about something? - Is it a boy? - No, no, mum! God, no! You just don't understand it, like, at all! Well, explain it to us. Maybe we can understand. That's the thing, is that I have tried to explain it many times, and you guys just never remember and you don't believe me. Believe what? That we're stuck in this house and we're never gonna leave. Why? Because all of us... Shut up, Lisa, shut up! Enough is enough, Lisa! Shh. Hey, hey. It's okay, buckaroo. Shh. Your sister is just playing a silly game. Lisa, you tell your brother that everything is okay. Lisa? I'm gonna go finish playing the clarinet in my room. Let me know when the Mac and cheese is ready. Safe-deposit key... is that what you were looking for, captain downing? Or should I say, Mr. downing or whatever your name is? Lisa Johnson. Me and Edgar found the pirate treasure. Meet us down in the secret cave. We're gonna spend all Sunday morning there. Lisa? Go downstairs to the basement and start the laundry, will you? I did it yesterday. You just don't remember me doing it. Stop being a smart aleck. Hey, Charlie brown, where's your glasses? I don't know. Well, find them, pronto. Lisa, have you decided where we're gonna go for your birthday tomorrow? Ask me tomorrow. Well, I hope we get there, because the car's not running. Your dad's been trying to fix it all day. Laundry, please. Cold water only. Hot wears out the clothes. Thank you. Thank you, and welcome to the white house. In a moment, I will be sitting at that desk, taking up a pen and signing the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code in the nation's history. To all of you here today, who've worked so hard and long to see this day come, my thanks. And the thanks of a nation go out to you. They haven't made this the freest country and the mightiest economic force on this planet by shrinking from challenges. They never gave up. And after almost 3 years of commitment and hard work... "The impossible became the inevitable." Early one morning, Peter opened the gate and went out into the big, green meadow. Lisa Did you wash everything in this load? Some clothes are missing. Yeah, I know. So, where are they? I don't know, mom. Okay? Those clothes are missing, like, every single day. Come downstairs, will you? Your father and I want to have a talk. Your mom says you've been acting kind of funny all morning. ...Captain downing? Or should I say, Mr. downing? Lisa Johnson. Me and Edgar found the pirate treasure. Meet us down in the secret cave. We're gonna spend all Sunday morning there. Lisa? Sweetheart, pancakes are ready! And... We're in focus. Okay. Our new home. We're in focus. Okay. Our new home. We're in focus. Our new home. Who are you? Hello? Is anybody here? Was that you playing the clarinet? Are you trying to contact me? Are you dead? Are you... Alive? Lisa? What? What are you doing up there? Nothing. Some clothes are missing from the laundry. Do you know where they are? No. Well, they went somewhere. Okay, just give me a second. Well, Bruce, if you get the car fixed, I'd love it if you could go and get a few groceries. Okay. Well, I'm working on it. So I have no idea where to start with it, but I am working on it. Mom, can I go play with Edgar? What about chocolate ice cream for dessert? Me and Edgar will both have double scoops. No. You will each have one scoop. Go ahead, Mr. Magoo. Lisa, you haven't even touched your meat loaf. Meat is murder. What's the matter, Lis? Since when do you smoke? Sorry? That's not part of the routine. I've never seen you smoke before. Your father always smokes after dinner, but he's gonna quit. Right, Bruce? Absolutely. A scoop for you tonight, honey? - What's wrong with two scoops? - God, you're as bad as Robbie. One or two scoops for you, Lisa? Where's dad and Robbie? Uh, your father is in the garage fixing the car, and Robbie's up in his room playing video games. What about "murder, she wrote"? Oh, sweetheart, do you mind watching it upstairs? I just... I really want to finish this chapter. I know. I know, I know. See if I can get this son of a bitch working. I don't know. I don't know why it won't work. I just don't. Lisa? Go to back inside, Lisa. I got a lot of work here to do. Go on. You, uh, go ahead, sweetheart. Good night. Good night, dad. Lisa. Who are you? Why are you here? What do you want? Lisa Johnson. Get away! Lisa... Lisa, are you there? Wake up, please. Something's wrong. I'm hiding. Come downstairs quick. Bruce, stop it! Stop it! What? Stop it! Then tell me where they are. I have no idea. You stole them from me. Why would I do that, Bruce? You stole them. Stop lying! Mom? Dad? Lisa, go upstairs. Take Robbie with you. Do you know where the spark plugs are, Lisa? The... the what? I have been trying to fix the car all morning, and I've now discovered that it's just the spark plugs. They're missing from the engine. Somebody's taken them. Was it you? Was it you?! No. No, dad. I don't know what you're talking about. - Mom, no, don't answer it. - Why not? Please. Please, mom, don't. Lisa, I am not gonna shut out the rest of the world just because your father gets upset sometimes. Good morning, ma'am. I'm from the phone company. We're checking the lines in the neighborhood today. Has your phone been out this morning? Well, yes, in fact, it has. We get a lot of static because of the fog. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience. Do you mind if I come in and check the Jacks? Yes, of course. Well, it looks like you folks got quite a mess on your hands, down here. I'll check upstairs first. Lisa? Laundry. Cold, not hot. Lisa, do what your mother says. I... I forgot something in my room. I'll... I'll be back in a minute. How long have you been awake? What? How long have you known, understood? Um... I don't... I don't know. Um, a... a week, maybe. I... I'm not sure. Who are you? What's going on? What... What happened to us? I... Whenever you hear strange noises in this house, or voices calling out to you, ignore them. Pretend they don't exist, Lisa. If you should try to contact the living, or anyone else, you and your family will suffer in ways you cannot fathom. Have yourself a wonderful day. Okay, thank you. So, Lisa, you gonna start the laundry? Did you put something different in the meat loaf tonight, honey? 'Cause it's... it's fantastic. I put a little bit of paprika in it. That might have done it. Mom, can I go play with Edgar? What about chocolate ice cream for dessert? Me and Edgar will both have double scoops. No, you and Edgar will each have one scoop. Go ahead, yosemite Sam. Lisa, you haven't even touched your meat loaf. Ah. That was amazing. Where's your cigarette? I'm sorry? Don't you always smoke after dinner? I don't know what you're talking about, Lisa. I don't smoke. Don't you start either, young lady. The surgeon general just came out with a warning that if... Wait. How... how can you just act like nothing even happened this morning? This morning? Are you talking about the clothes that are missing from the laundry? Do you know where they are? Have you decided where you want to go for your birthday tomorrow? Your father gets home at 6:00, so I was thinking that we could just... Sorry. What? I just... I can't do it anymore. You can't do what? I'm sorry. Where are you going? You haven't been excused, Lis. Lisa, where are you going? It's not safe out there. Lisa! Lisa, stop! Come back here! Lisa! Lisa! Hello? Hey, is anyone out there? Hello? Hello? Please I don't want to be stuck here anymore. You hear me? I said I don't want... There you are. Come on back inside, pal, it's just not safe riding out there. Bring your bike back into the garage. You can then... Lisa! Okay, no more games, young lady. Get inside now. Mom's got dessert on the table, and "murder, she wrote" is just about to start. Are you here? I'm sorry I told you to go away last night. I was just scared. I know it should be the other way around... right?... Since... You're the one who's alive and I'm the one who's... Dead? God, it feels weird just saying that. I don't know how I died or why or... How long I've been stuck in this stupid routine with my family. It's kind of like we've been sleepwalking for a really long time, but... Now I'm awake. There's someone else here, too. He's dead like me, I think. He doesn't want me to be awake or aware. He told me not to contact you. But I need to find a way out of here, and you're the only hope I've got to figure it out, so... Please. Please just talk to me. Who are you? What's your name? What's the first letter of your name? You have to move the piece to the first letter. Just move it anywhere. Just say something! Lisa? Help me, Lisa. Please help me. Olivia? What are you doing in there? Look under the floor. Olivia, what's happening? You okay? Open the door. Olivia! Lisa Johnson. Lisa! Me and Edgar found the pirate treasure. Meet us down in the secret cave. We're gonna spend all Sunday morning there. Hello? Help me. Lisa! Sweetheart, pancakes are ready. Come and help set the table, please. You know this is homemade syrup, huh? Homemade syrup? What, you tap the trees in the backyard? No, Bruce. - Mom? - Mm-hmm? Edgar wants more pancakes. Ask and Edgar shall receive. Phones are working again. I've got it. Hello. Yes. Can I ask who's calling, please? Certainly. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Just a sec. Lis, it's a Mr. woods. He says there's been some changes to your lab assignment. He wants to talk to you about it. Lise, come on. Don't keep him waiting. I'm sure he's got lots of other students he's got to call. Lis, take the phone. Goodness sakes. I thought I told you to mind your own business. You are a busy Betty, and I don't like busy betties. What's down in that room under the basement? Who's down there? I mean, that's your scrapbook under my bedroom floor, isn't? This is my house, Lisa. It always has been. Why are you keeping us here? Stop opening doors that are meant to be closed. Why? What are you gonna do to me? I'm already dead. Lisa. Come and finish your breakfast, please. It's gonna get cold. Mom, can I go play with Edgar? Okay. Finish your pancakes first. You get away from him! Lisa, no! He's my friend! Lisa, what are you doing? Don't you see him?! See who? Edgar! Lisa, stop teasing your brother. I'm not! He's right... Lisa. They only see what I let them see, Lisa, and so do you. Mom... Dad? Robbie? Oh, Robbie! No, no, no, Robbie! Please wake up! Mom, dad, wake up. Wake up! Please wake up. Oh. Oh. Oh. No! No, no, please! Please, I don't want to be alone! I don't want to be alone in this house! Please! Please bring them back! Please! Lisa? Lis, what's wrong? Talk to me. Sweetheart, it's okay. It's okay. Everything's all right. I got you, pal. I got you. Lisa. Leave me alone! Please! This is all a mistake. Things need to go back the way they were. Go away! Lisa. Olivia, come play with me. Olivia? We're having eggs and bacon, so come help me set the table. How'd you sleep last night? No more sleepwalking, right? Your father. Come on. I know, I know, I know. God damn it. I know. God, this son of a bitch. Oh, God. Ah, I can't figure out why it won't. Come on, work. Come on. I don't know, I don't know. Son of a bitch. Need something, Olivia? You need you to go back inside, okay? I'm busy. Come on. Oh, come on. Damn it! I don't want you coming in here when I'm working. You understand? Do you understand? I said, get out! Lisa. Lisa. Oh, my God. Are you okay? What happened? I think she's sleepwalking. I was standing in the kitchen, and she just walked right past me and came in here. Sweetheart, you okay? - I think we should call a doctor. - The phones are still out. Well, we should do something, Bruce. Mom, I'm fine. Can you just bring me some Mac and cheese? Yes, of course. Okay pal... I'm gonna be down in the garage if you need anything, all right? Dad? Yeah? Did you find the spark plugs? The spark plugs? That's why the car won't start. Oh, uh, no. I'm pretty sure it's just an engine valve. Don't worry, though, I'll have it fixed before your birthday tomorrow, and we'll all have a great time. You can pick any restaurant you want to go to. It'll be your special day. Lise, are you okay? How about we go to hackney's tomorrow? Uh-huh. You got a craving for some onion rings. Yeah and I'll... I'll get the butterscotch sundae to share. You know my weakness, don't you? Yeah, I think so. You get some rest, Lis. Love you. Love you too, dad. Olivia? Olivia, can you hear me? Olivia. Olivia, where are you? I need you to bring me back. I need you to show me everything that you... Lisa. Come in, Lisa, please. Robbie? Hi, Lisa. Edgar says you need to be punished for being bad. He says you're a busy Betty. Robbie where are you? The secret cave. Edgar's with me. We're on a treasure hunt. Where is the secret... Robbie? Robbie? Robbie, are you in here? Robbie? Robbie? Robbie? Robbie! Robbie! Oh! Oh, my God. Lisa? Robbie. Hi, Lisa. Robbie, where are you? You told me you were in the secret cave. We tricked you. What?! I'm in the attic, Lisa. I was hiding from you the whole time. Edgar says we've won the game. Robbie. Robbie? Damn it! Don't worry. I'll watch Robbie for you. No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! No, no! Let me out of here, you son of a bitch! Somebody help me, please! Please! No! Hello? Hello? Okay. Dad, is that you? Hello? Did he get you, too? Who are you? How long have you been his prisoner? Oh, my God. You're... you're Frances Nichols. You were the first girl he kidnapped. Who was he? Get away. I have to get this door open before he comes back. No, please. Tell me who he was. Please tell me. Please. I don't know his name. I was walking home after the movies last night. He was closing up his store and asked if I needed a ride home. When I came closer, he grabbed me, put a cloth over my face. I passed out and woke up here in his car. I was tied up in the back seat. And the engine was running. I thought I was gonna suffocate. But... but you didn't? Well, I'm talking to you, aren't I? Aah! Look, that man that kidnapped you, he's the reason that I'm here, too, and my family and all the other girls that were missing. He trapped us all in this house. He wants us to be asleep. That's how he controls us. Quiet. Are you coming? There's nothing out there. Well, I've got to get home. My family's worried about me. I've been gone all night. No, you've been gone much longer than that, Frances. Your family has already grieved over you. Then, they moved on with the rest of their lives. Grieved over me? You're wrong. That can't be right. When I touched this, we connected. How did you get my ring? After he murdered you, he dumped your body down below. And then he burned you up... Just like all the other girls. He was a monster. And I am so, so sorry that you had to go through that, Frances. I really, really am. But you have to wake up. We all do. - Frances! No! - This is my house, Lisa! Lisa? Lisa, what are you doing in here? You're supposed to be upstairs in your room, resting. Lisa! I know what happened. Lisa, what are you doing? Where is it? Lisa, stop it! Sweetheart, talk to me. Lisa. It happened to us in the garage, just like Frances and the others. Lisa, stop it. What happened? What are you talking about? Who's Frances? Oh, my God. It was dad. And you... you let him do this! What on earth are you talking about? You didn't even do anything to save us! Lisa, talk to me. Wake up, mom! Wake up! I won't let it happen again. Never again! Robbie? Where's Edgar? He left. Robbie, you do understand that me, you, and mom and dad aren't alive anymore... this isn't the real world? Mm-hmm. When did you figure that out? This morning... After I found my glasses. Your glasses? They were under my pillow. I didn't want to find them before, 'cause I was too scared. Why would you be scared of your glasses? 'Cause I was wearing them that night... the night we all died. Don't worry, Lisa, it's gonna be okay. We're just like pac-man. We play in the same maze over and over, and we can never die. We're always in our house, and that's just how it's got to be. That's what Edgar told me. Hi, Lisa. If you're watching this, it means you made it back. Or it means I'm crazy. Either way, I hope you find this. The one thing I do know is I'm scared. The man who lived here before you, was named Edgar mullins. He was born in this house. He murdered all those girls over the years. And then he died here in 1983. My dad... he's changed. My mom's useless... totally in denial. No one will believe a word I say. I found this in the garage last week. It's how we connected. It's yours, isn't it? It belonged to you before you died. You're the only one who understands what I'm going through. Help me, Lisa. Help me save my family. Where are they?! David. What are you looking for? What are you looking for?! Okay, I know what you're doing. I don't know what you're talking about. - Olivia? - Where are they? I'm scared. - Where did you put them?! - What?! - You know what I'm talking about! - I don't. David, stop please. Just stop. Where did you hide them? I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. - Right! - What's wrong with you? Why are you acting like this?! Olivia, go back to your room. Take your sister with you. Olivia, please. Sweetheart. Go upstairs. Do as your mother says, Olivia. - You shouldn't be down here. - No, no. Now, listen to me. Listen to me, okay? You need to get out of this house. Take your kids with you and don't ever, ever come back here again. Do you understand me? He is not your husband. She's, uh, confused. I think she was sleepwalking again. He is lying to you. He is lying. He's taken over Olivia's father. Oh, I mean... God, I mean my father. Anne... You take care of Emily. I am going to take Olivia upstairs to her room. No! It's all right, Olivia. It's me. It's dad. No! Hey! Hey! Help! Help! Please call the police! Help! Help! Oh! Oh! Silly girl. Don't you know a ghost can never leave its house? Lisa. Lisa. Honey, wake up. It's okay. Shhhh. It's okay. It's okay. I'm right here. You've been out for a while... a few hours. You collapsed on the front lawn. I thought that you were sleepwalking again, but... you weren't, were you? I mean, how could any of us be asleep, since... We're dead? I know. I finally know. I've woken up, too. But how? You told me that I didn't try to save us. But you were wrong. These are the clothes that have been missing from the laundry. I packed them that night. They're yours and mine and Robbie's. I was gonna sneak us out of the house in the middle of the night while your father was asleep... 'Cause I was afraid. I was afraid of what he might do. We never made it out of the house that night, did we? Have you talked to dad? No. He's in that garage as if nothing ever happened. - I'll go talk to him. - No! Mom. No. Mom, trust me. It's okay. All of us are safe now, and the only thing left for us to do is leave. Dad is the last one who needs to understand that. You tried to tell me again and again. I'm so sorry, sweetheart. It's okay. I know what to do. Oh, hey, there, kiddo. How are you feeling? Where are the spark plugs, dad? What do you mean? No one stole them. You lost them on purpose. Lisa, I don't know what you're talking about. You hid them from yourself. All right. Why would I do that? Because you knew what you were turning into. Now, where are they, dad? Deep down, you know. Take them out. Why? Do you feel anything? Not a thing. I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. Put them back in the engine. All right, Lisa, I've had just about enough of this nonsense. The engine. Turn the key. Dad? Do you remember? Do you remember what happened to us? I used ether... On you... And Robbie and your... and your mom. And then I carried you... Downstairs into here... From your bedrooms. And then I... And then you did what? God. Oh, God. You and Robbie and mom... my whole family. What have I done? No. It wasn't you. Of course it was me! No, no, it was someone else. He got inside you. He did this to us. Who? Bruce! Bruce! Carol, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What's happening? We're awake... all of us. Mommy, where are you?! I'm right here. What's going on? We need to get out of this house. Mommy, the sun's out! Robbie! Carol! Carol! Robbie! It's all right, sweetheart. We can leave. Lis? I love you, dad. I love all of you. Lisa! Lis! Get out of my my house, Lisa. Where do you think you're going, little butterfly? You cannot hide from me in this house, and certainly not in my own room. I don't need your company anymore. I don't need your family's. I got a new one to add to my collection. Olivia! Olivia, where are you? Olivia! Olivia, bring me back! Olivia! Olivia, open this door right now! Olivia! Where are you, Olivia? Silly girl. I'm here. I've got your things, so listen to me, all right? Wake up. All of you, wake up. We can send this bastard to hell, but we have to do it together. Frances... Please. Please. Help me. No one can help you now, Lisa. Shh. Just go to sleep. Go to sleep, now. Hello, Lisa. You just won't let go of Olivia, will you? Such a plucky girl. You know, you were the same way when you were alive. Trying to save your family from me, trying to fight the tide. And yet here we are, the two of us, and it ends the same. History doesn't repeat itself. It rhymes. Time for you to go, Lisa. Go ahead, step across. Your home is gone. Your time is gone. There's nothing left for you but oblivion... a place worse than death. I don't care. You can send me wherever the hell you want, but you're not killing this family tonight. You can't get the keys, so you can't start the car. Olivia's father leaves the spare on the workbench. No! No! I always do enjoy killing you. Goodbye, Edgar. Aaaaaah! Aaaaaah! Olivia? What happened? - I'm so sorry, Olivia. - It's okay, dad. We're gonna be a happy family again. Have a good life, Olivia. Lisa Johnson. Lisa, wake up. Lisa, I found the pirate treasure. We're gonna be rich. Come downstairs so I can give you your share. Hurry. It's your birthday present. Happy Birthday, Lisa. Happy 16, sweetheart. Dad? Mom? Where are we? We're home, honey. We're finally home. You want to take it for a spin? Will you come back for some cake and pirate treasure, Lisa? What's out there? Whatever you want there to be. Lisa. .::Synch & Improved by Dragonborn::.
