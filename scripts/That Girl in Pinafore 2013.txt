Do I look that old? Yes. Older than me. Since I suck at studying, I might as well start working. Anyway, my family's business needs help. Speaking of which, didn't you guys offer to help? Honestly, your parents' music lounge is pretty embarrassing. I don't care, if you guys are my bros You guys will learn these songs. And, these pamphlets. Man, you should pay us for this! Will we be paid commission? Haoban, why are you so calculative? You still owe us our share for the last time. That was quite a big sum. When have I ever missed a payment? I just forgot to bring the cash today. I think we should quit when we graduate to JC (Junior College). Our business is now at its peak. We're pushing our luck. Actually, business will be even better in JC. There are tons of rich kids. We raise our prices and aim for their wallets. And we should do our version of 'Playgirl' And get Xiaopang to be the coverboy. Shut up! Those two girls are bitchy! I think they want our attention. Hey they are from Saint Nicholas, my favourite! Hey Haoban, you always talk big. Why don't you get their numbers? You don't think I got the balls for it? You've got the balls, but have you got the skills? Ok! If I can get their numbers We'll take your pay for next month. It's a deal! Lend me your discman. What are you up to"! Just hand it over. It's a birthday present from my mom. My discman! Are you alright? How can you trash your drinks like that"! Oh please! You are the one who is blind. Don't blame us. My discman! The player is broken! What are you going to do about it"! We can say 'sorry'. My poor mother worked so hard So she can buy this discman for my birthday. We've apologized. What more do you want? I need you to compensate me. $300 300 bucks? You're insane! Do we look rich to you? Give me your address and telephone number I'll collect the money after you've saved up. 'Small white face' (gigolo), don't take us as idiots. What are you going to do with our address? Stalk us? You think I'm that free? Forget the address then. Just give me your telephone number. Where do I write it"! Here. What are your names? My name is Hay- Our last name is Zhang. I am younger, people call me Zhang Qing Fang (90s Singer). I am the elder sister, Zhang Man Yu (HK actress Maggie Cheung). Zhang Qing Fang, Zhang Man Yu.

I don't feel well. Not well? Did you eat something wrong? Exams tomorrow. I've had too much chicken essence & Red bull. I've overdosed. Hey hang on, I've got an incoming call. But I need your help. Jiaming! Save me! Haoban? What's happened? I can't concentrate at all. Did you drink Redbull? Not just Redbull I've also mixed in tons of chicken essence Can't focus! Worst part is, I am wide awake now! These things are potent! What should I do"! Remember what the teacher suggested? Change subjects every 30 minutes. You will focus better. Okay. Xiaopang? Are you alright? I think I'm high... I need help. Hey sorry. Another incoming call. Why's everyone calling at this hour"! Hey Jiaming! It's me, Caogen! Caogen? Quick, turn on the radio! I'm on the dedication program. Quick! Hello? it's me again! So who do you want to dedicate the next song to"! I want to dedicate the next song to my friends. They are having exams tomorrow. So I want to wish them good luck! Anything else? I feel like singing the song myself. Ok, as long as it is not vulgar. Oh it isn't! It's a patriotic song! Ok go ahead then. We live here in Singapore My father used to live in Hoi Shan Street (Upper Cross Street) A Japanese bomber ew over here in 1941 A bomb was dropped right here on this street We live here in Singapore My mother gave birth to me at Tekka There were plenty of illegal cabs here So she took a scooter to work We live here in Singapore I grew up in Queenstown Behind the tiny apartment at ls a tiny little forest Where I used to play when I was a kid We live here in Singapore We used to have nothing Though what we have here is not much But we treasure them more than anybody else We live here in Singapore My cousin has just returned from San Francisco Like a little sparrow carrying a branch Always returning home where it belongs A little sparrow carrying a branch Perched on a branch, peering at Auntie Auntie is getting married and ties a buttery knot Her beautiful hair is lined with owers on both sides We live here in Singapore My elementary school used to be at Middle Road And when I didn't work hard in school I would go to the temple nearby before the exams and pray hard at the Buddha's feet We live here in Singapore My cousin has just returned from San Francisco Like a little sparrow carrying a branch Always returning home where it belongs Like a sparrow carrying a branch Always returning home where it belongs Though I suck at studying But like every other student I still hoped for good results. So my parents won't be disappointed. But due to my lousy English All other subjects suffered as well. Hubby, we lost money this month again. Don't worry. We shall prevail! My parents love music. My father wanted to be in a band. My mother wanted to become a singer. Few months ago, they dumped all their savings into 'Meng Chuan' (Dream Boat). Business was ok for a while. But as it turns out People rather listen to themselves sing Than listen to others. So the business went from bad to worse. Ma, Pa, I'm heading to school. Good luck! Son! I am a young patriotic soldier! I am filled with enthusiasm and passion! I have an abundance of energy! Put your trust in me, Singapore! Prosper! Son. Stay calm. I think... he's still doomed Jiajun, what are you laughing about? I don't understand what I am watching. Hey, aren't you going to wish me good luck? Score an 'A'. Elder brother, good luck! Hope you return with a 'D'! 'D'? You cursing me? No, 'D' for 'Damn Good'! Do you smell something? It's you again! C'mon guys! I'm stressed. Hey look! The girls from the airport. I think the bitchy one is cute, how about you? They both look the same to me. Son, take it easy. You're our son. We won't look down on you for being stupid. It's not like we need you to take care of us anyway. And you will inherit 'Meng Chuan' eventually. Son... We have a vision for tomorrow... just believe, just believe We have a goal for Singapore... We can achieve - What can we achieve with results like this? You and me, we'll do our part 3 months later Hello everyone! This is a Singapore folk song that I wrote! Let my heart break completely! Wow, this singer is a new low. Even my parents won't want to be seen here. I'm going deaf. My eyes are bleeding. You are behind on payments for a few months already! I'm so sorry. I'll pay you in a few days. Once my business picks up I will repay you! How can your business improve? Your singer sounds like a cat in heat! I'll give you 3 more days. This joint really is the dumps. Why don't we restart our business in JC (Junior College) now? Didn't we call it quits? What happens if we are caught? We've already done it for 4 years. What are you afraid of? It's extra pocket money for us, why not"! I'll go pick up new stock tonight. There's Loletta Lee. Loletta Lee? Really? Quiet down! I'm trying to sing! Please! Long time no see. Any new stock? See you later. What do you want to eat later? I feel like having... fried rice! Then I will have... chicken rice! Fat boy! Have you fixed your discman? - Not yet. Ask your fair boy friend to call us! Just my luck To end up in the same college with these two crazy girls. Chatting up the girls eh? I still have their number. You want it? When will you compensate me for the discman? I'll pay you once I get the cash. Break it off guys. Xiaopang, where are the goods? Hand one over. It's really Loletta Lee! I'll never tire of her. This place is too crowded. Read later. Read it later, I said! Listen up. Jiaming used to keep the time. Now it's my turn. Xiaopang, handle the good s. Caogen, you'll handle the cash. When the science classes breaks, we'll get ready. Ready, Steady... Prosper! Hey boss... look. Listen up, everyone. 7 minutes... no more, no less. What if I can't come in 7 minutes? That's your problem, not mine! Ok time's up! Get out! Not so loud. And don't go publicizing this. Playboy, Penthouse, and Loletta Lee? $7. $7, $10. Plus Free tissue! So how's business today? Business today was so damn good! See for yourself! This is quite a pile! If onlyJiaming was here. Is it safe to leave the magazines in the locker? What do you guys think? It's better to bring it home. Yea h, okay. You'd better be careful with those! I better be off to class. Me too. Bye! Fat boy, why are you avoiding us"! Why would I? You guys are so nice to me.

And I want you to practice your English Anyway Uncle Chew is returning to the States tomorrow. He is preparing a room for you for when you go over later this year. The best thing is he's found a doctor who can help you with your heart condition. Thanks, Uncle Chew. You're still young. There are lots of opportunities over there.

Hey guys. Thanks for your help. We owe you one. We can treat you all to a meal. Just one meal? We've saved your asses back there! You think playing drums is easy? It's difficult! Yeah! You owe us two meals. So what do you expect? Sacrificial offerings? Holy matrimony? Oh that would be nice! I knew you boys habor bad intentions! All men are the same! Hey don't make us out to be devils. How about this"! 'Meng Chuan' is run by my family. Perform there once and we'll call it even. It's your family business? I don't trust that 'small white face'.

There'll be more exciting performances! Yeah! Xiaopang really sucks at this. Hey guys. This is my tutor, Liyana. Hi everyone! (In Chinese) She's Malay.

Thanks for coming! It's a bit empty today. Let me show you to your seats! You guys don't need introductions. This is our Malay friend, Liyana. It's her first time here. Hi everyone, I speak Chinese. You can speak Chinese? That's so cool! I am May. Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Jayley Woo her younger sister. And I am Hayley Woo her elder sister. Hang on... Isn't your last name 'Zhang'? Dumbass.

So we're really free. Okay... Enough talk. Let's sing! Come with me. You know this song too. I walk alone at dusk on this mountain trek The glow in the skies revealed my loneliness I whispered a melancholic tune With a tinge of sadness in my voice The tune oats into my beating heart I walk alone at dusk on this mountain trek Our paths crossed and my eyes met yours The whole event is like a dream Like those love stories that we used to hear Could this moment be as such? I gazed upon the skies and prayed deeply May this moment last till eternity. Like father, like son. The performance was not bad eh? Since business is so bad we should do something to make this place more hip. Yeah. So what if you guys are good at your music? Nobody knows about this place. You boys should really repackage yourself. Repackage? What's wrong with this package? No one performs with ip ops on stage! I love ip ops! Very comfortable! Let's make a bet. If you girls can improve business at 'Meng Chuan' we'll do whatever you want! Do anything? No problem! Okay! We'll start by changing your clothes! Your shoes! Your image! When I was a carefree kid, everything was interesting I wait at home for my brother to return from school daily I ask my dad, when will it be my turn to ride in the school bus My daddy smiled and replied One step at a time After I started school, I realised it wasn't too interesting. Staring at my watch in classes, wondering about the holidays This is the place. Price is negotiable. Please support! Please come! The sun will set, and rise the next morning Don't watch VHS overnight Withered owers will bloom again next year But there may not be a 2nd chance at examinations. When I was 18 years old, I started dating. Wrote many love letters and waited at many bus stops Do you want more drinks? Yes, yes! More, more! Her mother told me to take things One step at a time Upon graduation, I realised that worklife is even more interesting Countless of interviews, before I was successful I was too embarrased about my pay Look! They both look close. After I got married, I got into more debt. I got myself a wife, but no money for kids. You must come to support us! Or we'll be very disappointed. Definitely! Definitely! How adorable! They're using sex appeal. Not everyone's a genius, and it is fine being ordinary Just like lining up for a bus We gotta take things one step at a time We gotta take things one step at a time The sun will set, and rise the next morning I'm rushing my life through like the MRT (subway) Withered owers will bloom again next year In life we should take things one step at a time. In life we should take things one step at a time. Woah! Full house. What now"! Full house! Change your clothes! What kind of a stupid bet is this? Xiaopang, you look radiant.

She wants me to be independent like her so I won't get easily cheated by men. Especially Singaporean men. Singaporean men? What's wrong with Singaporean men"! Where can you find a man as handsome as me? Let me tell you a story. My mom used to be in a band. She can sing really well. She fell in love with a guitarist. After she got pregnant that guy left her. That's why she wants to leave this place and for me to study abroad. Study abroad? But do you want to leave? I don't know. I don't know if I want to study abroad. But I do know I'll miss everything here. Of course! I'm sure you'll miss me. Who says so? Don't atter yourself. I'll not fall for a boy like you. Luckily, you're not my type either. What's wrong with a girl like me"! High maintenance. You are not up to it. I think it is tough to maintain a long distance relationship. If you set your mind to it nothing's impossible. The seagulls circle your slender figure The sun rises and sets for you Whether the sea waves caresses your feet Or if strong winds howls at you You still stand strong and withstand the changes You have watched over numerous faint lights over the seas You've looked over the multiple returning sails The seas offer beautiful words they come and go ceaselessly Yet you stand strong and would never lament You trying to charm me with this song? But I was singing about coconut trees. My home. I'll be... heading in. Good night. Good night. Miss. Madam's on the phone. I don't understand why you are still going to school. You're already going to the States soon. Do you love Uncle Chew? I think I will be happy with him. Are you using him to get a Green Card? Well, with a Green Card you're going to get a better life, rig ht"! I don't think I can be with someone I don't love. May... I don't want to argue with you today. It's your birthday! Tonight we will have a nice birthday dinner with Uncle Chew. I can't do dinner tonight. I don't know when my ECA (Extra Curriculum Activities) will end. May! Happy birthday! My 'Shen Nu' (Goddess - Old chinese term for prostitute). Do you know what 'shen nu' means? Don't know. Whatever. Why are you still doing this? Because I love you. Why won't you give up? Why do you keep rejecting me? Because I don't fancy you. Not even as a friend. We can develop our feelings over time. Are you in love with someone else? Is it that Lee Jiaming? So what if it is? We can't be together. You're not my type. Why do you girls always say that"! May. May. Quick, go get changed! But I just got to school. Isn't it your birthday today? We have a surprise for you. Where are we going? Four, please. 5llrprisell Happy Birthday! Kiss her! That boy fucks your daughter. You know you have a heart condition right? Those kids are going to ruin your future. They have no discipline whatsoever. They are not bad kids. I know what's rig ht or wrong. I'm not a kid anymore. You've been skipping school and lying to me. You have no idea what's right or wrong? Do you want to end up like that? What's wrong with that"! This is not what I have planned for your future! These are your plans. Not mine. You're the one who wants to go to the States. Not me. Wake up, May. Music has got no future in Singapore. I want you to stop hanging out with that bunch of idiots! Don't insult my friends. You mean your boyfriend? Did you sleep with him? No! Don't lie to me. Answer me! So what if I did? May. Are you alright? I'm annoyed... Why do they treat me like this? Why is my mom like an asshole? Why is James like an as$7 You never told me the bus numbers to your home? I got lost Hey crazy bitch. Stop screaming. I want to sleep. It's late. You'd like to vent your anger? I'll take you to a place. What the fuck! No one will care. What the F%$! Go to hell! Where have you been? I've been paging you all night! Give me your bag. - What are you trying to do"! Give it to me! You can't do this to me! - Stop it! I've had enough of your nonsense! You can't do this to me. What are you trying to do? Mommy! Mommy, you can't lock me up! Open the door! Open the door now! You are going to the US next week. You're not leaving this house before that. Understand? Mommy please. Mommy, please let me out. I'm so sorry. Let me out, Mommy. I was wrong. I am so sorry. Ever since the tea dance we haven't seen May at all. We can't reach her at all. Why are you always on the phone these nights? You've chalked up the telephone bills you know? Study harder, so it's easier to get a job. All those musicians, they come to eat my Fried Kuay Tiao too! Liang Wen Fu, Eric Moo (Singapore musicians) Stop bullshitting, I've never seen them come. Son, come over here. Your dad at your age, is just the same. Caogen listen up. Hormones off the charts. Very horny. Why are you holding a chewing gum? Where can you find chewing gum in Singapore? You better learn how to use this! You'd better not get sick from outside! I'll kick you out of the house! No STD (Sexually Transmitted Diseases)! Understood? I've never even seen this before. Don't forget to use it! Son. Is your Chinese tuition teacher a Malay girl? Yup. Her Chinese is very good! Why did you ask"! Is she our driver's daughter? She's smart, isn't she? A Malay, who can speak Chinese. And I heard she is pretty too. You think so too? She's very smart. Pa, you'll like her. Are you going out with her? No... Yes... We've just gone out a few times. Kids your age think it is cool to have a girlfriend. But why this girl? What's wrong with her? Your background... her background. It's not so straightforward, son. Is it because her father is our driver? And they are Malay"! Things are not so simple! You a re just racist. Hey! Watch your words! Let me ask you! Can you speak Malay? What do you know about her religion? If you go all the way and marry her you'll need to be circumcised? Mommy has bought your favorite roast pork rice. I'm vegetarian today! May wanted me to come and see you. She wants me to tell you to stop calling her. She wants you to forget about her. Because she doesn't believe in long distance relationships. I don't believe you. Fine. But can I ask you a question? You know she is going to the States for her studies. And she's going to have a very bright future. Can you promise her that sort of a future? If you really really love my daughter You will let her go. I don't want to sell Char Kuay Tiao! I don't want to sell owers! I want to have a choice! I don't want to be looked down upon! I'll shoot you all! Hi! Who's calling? Hi, my name is Jiaming. Jiaming, it is so late now. Staying up to study? I'm not in school anymore. Just can't sleep. Who would you like to dedicate the next song to"! To my girlfriend. And her name is"! May. Do you have any messages? No matter where she goes... I wish for her to be happy always. So your girlfriend's leaving? She's going overseas for studies. She can still come back, right? How do I put this? I think we've broken up. You think? Don't you know if you have? She got her mom to speak to me and told me to stop looking for her. Sounds odd, but that's how it happened. She should have the courage to tell you in person. At least a final good bye. Maybe it is harder to do it in person. Maybe it'd be too awkward. The next song is going out to Jiaming and May... and I wish all couples in the world happy forever May! I don't want to go. 'I will see you at the airport' Going overseas for studies is good for you. But I will wait for you to return. What time is the ight? Flight's at 8. But I have to be at the airport at 6. Then we don't have much time. Hello? Xiaopang? Camera! Come, let's go! Nobody will care. Where are we going? I don't know! Where do you want to go"! I don't know either! 'JM LOVES COCONUTS' Stars! It's beautiful! Please watch the road. I'm sorry. Jiaming, I'll help you with that. Remember to write. Uncle Chew will wait for you at the airport. I'll join you as soon as I can. Take care of yourself. This is the last time I'll ever listen to you. Go find her. Jiaming. Promise me. Go back to school, and study hard. Don't let anyone look down on you. You can do it. I can do it! After I returned to Singapore we kept in touch mostly by writing. Phone calls were expensive. So I am very happy whenever I get to hear her voice. Coming back to Singapore? When? In a couple of months Why so sudden? I've a surprise for you. What surprise? If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise anymore. I never knew that'd be the last time I'd ever hear her voice. 'JM LOVES MAY' Life is just like the movies Many things are often unpredictable There are good people and nasty ones And not everything is always fair. Losers! This is my place now. It's time for you guys to get lost! What is this crappy place? Cost me a bomb! Nothing lasts forever. All good things must also come to an end. Even the old man who used to drink at our place stopped coming one day. As time goes by, we got together less. Maybe we all got busy with our own lives Maybe we all matured Or maybe it is just the price you pay for growing up. Who's that sissy? Who's that crazy bitch? COE is crazy expensive now. Who buys new cars these days? Used cars are the best! This is my business card. Insurance. Property. Buffet catering. Contractor. Pet grooming. And I went back to school. And got a degree in English Literature. Today I teach at a prestigious college. You can only see things clearly with your heart What is essential is invisible to the eye. Like I said, life is like the movies Many things are often unpredictable. May is awake. Dear, go back to sleep. I'll take care of it. Hello dear... Come, Daddy will carry you. Auntie. - Hey, Jiaming how are you? Auntie. - Hey, Jiaming how are you? I am good. How about you? Not bad, not bad. How about Caogen? I haven't seen him in a while. He's doing fine. I'm buying the same thing. You buy the same thing every year. I just don't understand. May died 18 years ago. I was told that mom had a weak heart. She died while giving birth to me. Grand ma gave me away after that. Are you alright? I'm okay. There's just too many fond memories. How are you? Are you happy? I love my foster parents a lot. But for the most part I've always wondered what my dad looks like. I always knew that my mom is a Singaporean. Uncle Jiaming... Could you tell me a little bit more about my mom? We were very close friends. I was always happy whenever we were together. I remember the days we were in a band. I remember the songs that we sang. And the dancing too. We were really happy. If her friends knew that she had a daughter They would be so happy and surprised. I would love to meet them. Look, how about this"! I will be performing at Clarke Quay tomorrow night. And I would love it if you and mom's old friends could come. We will be there. I won't be lonely With my one and only 'Cause I can see forever Feeling her in my arms... Rachel Hi Uncle Jiaming! I'm so glad you are here! I have something for you. I've kept it for a long time. Some of these things belonged to your mom. I thought you should have it. Wow, I'm really grateful for this. Thank you. My performance is up next so... stick around and I'll come find you? Sure! See you! Thank you, thank you very much. That's the end of my set for tonight. Next up, we have some friends from the States. So please stay tuned. Xiaopang, where are you? Right behind you. Long time no see! Haoban! Caogen! - Long time no see! Sit, sit. Wow the kids are big now! Greet Uncle Jiaming. Uncle Jiaming. - Good boys! Jiaming how have you been? - Good! Caogen, what are you selling these days? There's nothing I don't sell! This is Singapore. Tough making money. You asked us here to watch a gig? Yes. I think they are starting soon. Hi everyone! Thank you so much for coming down here. Thank you so much for the opportunity to perform here tonight. I am absolutely grateful. I would like to start the set off with a local oldie and it is dedicated to a group of people over there who were once my mom's best friends. Guess what? My mom's actually Singaporean. This song is called 'Everlasting Friendship'. I hope you guys like it. When we were young. We all had dreams. There was once you revealed your wishes. And when your birthday came I gave you a harmonica I'll never forget The smile on your face Friendship is like a river that strings our hearts together I used to cheer for you at the basketball court and pick you up when you fall. And when I see the shooting star across the night sky The night breezes hear our every aspirations When we were young. We had our sorrows Only you could understand my indignation Whenever I am feeling down You'd play that familiar tune The sound of the instrument eases my pain Friendship is like a river that parts The time will come when we go our separate ways I'll put a pat on your back don't get too melancholic The world may be precarious But we'll be steadfast in our direction Regardless of the outcome, we'll not forget our times together. Yea rs later We'll meet again smiling with our wrinkled faces I will ask again my friend Will you play the harmonica again? Just like the old times. Just like the old times. Friendship is like a river that parts The time will come when we go our separate ways I'll put a pat on your back don't get too melancholic The world may be precarious But we'll be steadfast in our direction Regardless of outcome, we'll not forget our times together Yea rs later We'll meet again smiling with our wrinkled faces I will ask again my friend Will you play the harmonica again? Just like the old times. Just like the old times. We have countless encounters in our lives only true friendship will lasts We shall all hope for everlasting friendship Just like the old times.
