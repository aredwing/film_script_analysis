We can't get a better place for Rs.100. - Shut up! - Okay. Now come. Pull up the bed sheets. Dude, I have the liquor... ...but nothing to mix with it. What are you going to mix it with? Man made liquor.. mixed with the natural water, gives us the real high. Try it. Despite growing old... I didn't know it. No ticket. You have run away from home? Did you fail the exam? Did you steal money from your parents? Did you kill someone? I fell in love. So you must have suffered a lot? The almighty has to save you. My birth was a funny incident. Oh God! Fool! I asked you to get an auto rickshaw. What are you doing? Get up, man! now move! My wife is having labor pain. Please help me. Why should I help you? Its getting late. Please help. Gosh! The liquor shops will close soon! I will give more than the fare, please take us to the hospital. I'm going to buy liquor. I need to go to hospital. Impossible. Why? Passengers have already boarded. Take a look. Who is that? Oh God! - Hey! When did you people get in? Even her wife is pregnant. - You too! - I will adjust. - What? - There is no place. - Come on! Careful! Get in. 2 pregnant ladies in the first scene. Director is conveying a message. What baby is it? Boy or girl? - Boy - Then the other one is girl. It seems to be a love story. Stop talking. Arrogant idiots. I'm helping you at the risk of losing my liquor. Are you showing off your attitude? Your turn is awaiting soon. - Stop!! - Here he comes. - Hey Mr. - What is it? My wife is having the labor pain. - Don't panic. - Please help - Please help! - Don't blabber. - I know all the heroes of Bollywood. - Thank you. - See I scared him with my English. - Get in. You too. You got her conceived? Get in, moron. You don't deserve respect! What is it, madam? Boy or girl? Girl. Great! A boy and 2 girls. Guess there is a twist in the movie. Probably a triangular love story. Who is crying? I'll thrash you. When the other two can bear it? Why can't you? Please sing the song. How can I sing it now? - Only when the song is sung.. - Oh God! - the baby movement slows down - Oh God! Hey, Mr. sing that song. I too can feel the vibrations. We have reached the hospital. - Please get down. - Doctor! Doctor! wake up please. - What happened? - Three ladies are facing the labor pain. - 3 ladies? - Yes, Dr. - But I'm the only one available. - But there are 3 ladies. Please take them to another hospital. We can't save their lives. - What do you mean? - I can! They can be saved. We must aid the women in need. - That's humanity. - But there are no rooms - Take them to a ward. - That's fine. But, only 2 stretchers are available. I see.. Help me! Have faith in God! Don't worry. Don't cry. I'll not let the women cry. - Oh God! - What happened? - Doctor?! - Doctor?! Are they safe? The women have given birth to 3 cute babies. Thank you, very much Dr. I was born along with 2 girls. I was very happy. - Where is my kid? - Where is my kid?- Move aside. - Where is my kid? - Fools, look at the token. - Token? - Here is my kid. - My son! - My darling! - My cutie! My lovely daughter. Thank you, God! You have given me an angel. You will become a great doctor. You will become a reputed engineer. You will become a cop! You will become a scientist! My son! My cutie, you are my replica. - Hello! - Bro! - My dear brother. - Bro! Look at our son. Not ours! Its yours. - Okay. My son!! - Look at him! - My sweetie! I will go visit Hema. - Okay. Teach him something good. - I know. You are a lucky chap! You are sleeping beside 2 girls. But... No matter what you become.. May be a doctor! An engineer! Or a great scientist! But don't trust girls. Learn from my mistakes. I got dumped 'n' number of times. Since my childhood, Aditi and Ramya are my world. We were brought up in a same colony. - Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you!! - Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday to Ramya! Happy birthday to you! Give her a bite! You too share it, girls! Kiss Aditi! - Aditi! - Coming... Kiss her! - Ramya - Coming.. Why are you looking dejected, Ramya? I don't like to celebrate my birthday. Why? I would have got many gifts had I celebrated at my home. Here only you and Aditi get gifts. No issues, take whichever gift you want. I don't need it. It's your birthday too! Take whichever you like. I want that one. I can't give that. My uncle had made it himself just for me. You promised me. I can't it give it. Take any other gift. - Jeeva. - I'm coming, dad. Seek blessings from uncle. Ramya. I liked the song. What's it, dear? That's my gift. She stole it. - Is it his gift? - Oh no! - Give it back to him. - Give it. - Give it back to him. - Return it. Jeeva! - Why did you do so? - I'm coming, mom. 2 ones are 2. 2 twos are 4. 2 threes are 6. 2 ones are 2. 2 twos are 4. 2 threes are 6. Thank you Jeeva. You gifted her? What about mine? I'll give it tomorrow, Aditi. Moon is the closest planet next to Earth. Note that. Uncle, I gifted Rajini box to Ramya. - Okay. But, now Aditi wants a gift. Give me money. I can't give money. Don't provoke me. Listen.. Uncle, lend me money. Listen to me, sweetie. Tell her that you will gift her the moon. And tell the moon will follow her. Jeeva! Where is my gift? I have prayed to the God. The moon is yours. What? The moon will follow you everywhere. What are you blabbering? I swear. Mark my words. Moon will follow you. Promise! Are you ready? We are going for shopping. The moon will follow you everywhere. Thanks, Jeeva. Ring-a-ring o'roses. A pocket full of posies. - A pocket full of posies. I have to teach a lesson to Jeeva. What are you going to do? Ramya or Aditi. I will make one among them to fall in love with me. You aren't smart enough to do it. How can you say that? I will prove you wrong. Let's see. - Can I join you? - Yes.. - Thank you. - Ring-a-ring o'roses. - A pocket full of posies. - A-tishoo! A-tishoo! We all fall down. Go to hell! We have to insult him. Yes. We have to scold him badly. Teach us foul words. Dog.. Pig.. Something worse than that Jeeva! Useless fellow.. Buffalo.. More stronger.. Teach us more vulgar words. - 'David Pulla'. - 'David Pulla'? My neighbour always abuses like that when he is on the phone. I did ask him. He said... If a boy talks with many girls, he is 'David Pulla'. If a girl talks with many boys, she is 'David Pulla'. - Why do you keeping pulling my cheeks? - Because you are so bubbly! Yes, he is a 'David Pulla'... Jeeva! We are going scold him. Go ahead.. Joshua.. - What? - You 'David Pulla'. Yes, my dad is 'David'. I am his son(pulla). I am 'David Pulla'. He agrees. Did he? Let him go. I was leading a happy life. Aditi went to Bangalore for a week. Ramya and I were alone. That was the first time my hormones started working... The day I attained my puberty. Is everyone present? - Aditi isn't absent. Is everyone present? Maintain silence till the photoshoot is done. Is it clear? Okay. - Sorry, Ramya. Stand still. - Sorry. - Don't fall on me, idiot. - Stand still. That touch changed my perspective of looking at Ramya. It was God's play to send Aditi to Bangalore. Ready... Smile... I wanted to check if Aditi has the same feelings. - Hey. - Uncle. What is real love? Amidst heavy traffic... ... A fellow will scream your name. You won't hear it. In the same scenario... A girl who is in love with you... ... will call you at a normal tone You will hear it. That's called true love. Hello.. Is it audible? - Let me get my work done. - I am at the flour mill. I'm waiting since a long time. Yes, the one near your house. I'll thrash you. - Don't talk to me. - Go to hell. - How long should I wait? Don't spoil my mood. - Shut up. This is the right place. I will go sit there and will talk to you. Checkout if you can hear. I love, Ramya. - Is it audible? No. My love for Ramya is genuine. No. You idiot. I really love Ramya. Can you hear it? Isn't it audible? - No. None can hear anyone's voice in this noisy place. But, if I'm able to hear Ramya's voice... ...like the heroine's voice from movies Ramya is in love with me. Ramya! Ramya! Ramya!! Can you hear it? There are people around! Enough? Jeeva! Did you call me? Yes. Why did you come here? To meet you. Is it done? Yes. Then leave. What have you decided about Jeeva? Nothing yet. Boys are like computers. First come first served. They don't differentiate between good and bad girls. They will accept the proposal of the first girl. Propose him before Aditi does. It's farewell tomorrow. I'm repeating it. Aditi is not in the town. This is the correct time. I'm confused whether it is real love! Answer my question correctly. Whose face do you remember when you get excited? Jeeva. That's it, you are loving him. This is the best time for you to propose. Once they enter college, they will not be the same. Whom do you like the most? Aditi or Ramya? I like Aditi... But I like Ramya more than her. Then don't waste the time. Everyone's writing "ALL THE BEST" on other's t-shirts.. Write ' I love you' on her t-shirt. Okay, dude. It's easy to say 'yes'. She is coming, write it. Jeeva, for me? Won't you write on my t-shirt? - Do it. - I'm scared. Write, Turn. Now I'll. Bye, Jeeva. Buddy. I got scared and wrote 'Good night.. sweet dreams'. You totally spoiled it. Did I ask you to propose orally? I just asked you to write it. Useless. You failed to propose to Ramya. Can you propose it to Aditi? Stop. Why didn't you write it? What's your problem? You ruined it. I did tell you that girls will change after going to college. Listen.. What.. Everyone is staring at us. - Oh God! - Jeeva? Why is everyone staring at us? Turn. That was indeed a strong proposal. It was heavenly! I felt the happiness of watching volumes of adult video. You made Ramya to fall in love with you. Don't forget us. I won't. Give a substitute for 'friendship' which is also a synonym for inseparable. - A single word. - A word? Definition for 'friend'? I'm the first syllable - Okay. You are the second syllable. Dude, it's mind blowing. This is an unique definition. Where is the leg piece? Just now I parceled it to Ramya's house. It's the routine reply. Jeeva, you are concentrating in physics. Try out mathematics as well. Too much of academics. Are you working out mathematics? I have just started it. - Concentrate on it. Only then you can succeed. At least try to clear it in the upcoming exam. It's very tough, mom. Very very big problems. Leg piece! - Who rang the bell? - It's Dad. He bought chicken Chicken? That's a rarity. - Hello. - Jeeva, come to the A2 water pipe immediately. - It's 1 AM. - What? - I can't come. - What do you mean? My mom is sleeping next to me. As a girl when I can do it, why can't you? Wear the green shirt that I gifted and come downstairs. What do you want? How was the leg piece? Did you come here to know that? - Tell me. - It was good. Go! Someone might see us. I have proposed through writing. I wanted to propose orally. Just words won't make you understand. - Wait a moment. - What's it? What's it? This is the leftovers of my dad's drink. You have it, only then you will understand my feelings. I never had rum. Someday you will have it because of a girl. Let it be now. Have it. Ramya. Drink Jeeva. They mix it with something? Nothing is available now! Just drink. What happened? Side dish? Side dish? Jeeva, will you take me to some place? Where are we going? I'm heedlessly going crazy. The obscured eyes is showing the signs of love. The glistening and blooming flower is wounded. Your touch has raised my temperature. I shrivel in your thoughts Your pursuit for me.. Let's stay together forever. Let's get intimate and enjoy the gloomy solitude. Let me enjoy your painful pleasures all night. Your hushed eyes make me go crazy. I'll live with you through ebb and flow. Lets culminate our dreams and make it greedy dream. Let's get lost in the gloomy night. Your love for me is making spend sleepless nights. Love makes one to banish the boundaries. Your eyes are the reflectors of my love. Awaken me before the Sun does it. You and me are synonymous with us. My happiness is just embracing you. Let's get closer in the solitude. I lost myself in absurdness. Don't go crazy following me up. Don't hurt your love. I'm heedlessly going crazy. The obscured eyes is showing the signs of love. The glistening and blooming flower is wounded. Your touch has soared up my temperature. I shrivel in your thoughts Your pursuit for me.. Let's stay together forever. Let's get intimate and enjoy the gloomy solitude. Let me enjoy your painful pleasures all night. Your hushed eyes make me go crazy. I'll live with you through ebb and flow. Renu is to be pitied. She is suffering a lot. What's that cut on your neck? A cat pounced on me. Did you and cat make love? Not cat. It's Ramya. - Did you do it? - No. What happened? - Just petting. Promise me that you won't disclose it. None will share such things. Promise me. Done. Yes, sir. Chennai is horrible. I got transferred. Pack your things. We are leaving in a week. Dad, I am in 12th grade. Don't you know it? How can I join a new school? I will not leave Chennai... away from Jeeva.. My friends are in Chennai. You can leave with mom. I won't go anywhere. My daughter is in twelfth grade. Can you cancel the orders? I'm sure. Idiot, he promised not to disclose to anyone! Ramya. I asked you to propose. - Did I ask you to make love? - What do you mean? Did you visit Jeeva yesterday? The whole school knows it. You have been disgraced. What happened yesterday? You got me punished for a silly mistake. Not just me, but the whole school knows about your relationship. - Get lost. - Why are you crying? He has spread throughout the school. He may spread it through social media too. Had I been in your shoes I would have dumped him. Wouldn't you do the same? Where are you going? Jeeva was lying that it was just a petting. Uchcha! Yes, Ramya. Where is Jeeva? I don't know. Tell me, bloody. - Great, buddy. - Jeeva. This is boys' urinal. Get out. Get out! We will got to the girls' lavatory. - Non sense. Whole school knows it. You thought Im cheap as I proposed to you? No, I didn't mean so. Sorry, Ramya. - Shut up. This is the reason why girls take time to accept proposals. If you really loved me, would you have shared it? Did you know how Dinesh humiliated me? It was disgusting. Sorry. I really love you, Ramya. We didn't fall in love. It was something else. Get away from me. We have crossed half the path of a relationship. How can you leave me? We have been very intimate. You will remember me when you move closely with someone. Just to forget you, I'll move closely with someone. Ramya, I have canceled the transfer orders as per your wish. Our next 4 years will be in Chennai. We are moving out of Chennai. Act now. Got it? As you wished, I canceled it just now. Choose one. Transfer or divorce. What happened to her? Rascal. - Hello. - Hello. - Who is it? - It's Jeeva. You? Why are you calling from a new number? I have no talk time in my mobile. Idiot. Ramya is moving out of the colony. Oh! what happened? Everyone knows about our relationship? How can do such things in school? You are the first student to do so. Idiot, I'm talking about my relationship. - What? - She dumped me, uncle. Go to her and beg her to forgive you. Will she forgive me? When we can get a liquor if we plead the bar tender. she will accept your apology if you plead. She is yours. Rotten bud. - Hello. - What? - I did all the mistakes. I didn't mean it. Uchcha promised to keep it a secret. Hang the phone, scoundrel. - I'll die without you. - Go to hell, moron. Moron? How dare you call me names? Are you leaving the town, Ramya? Are you dumping me? Get lost. Return my sweet moments. Return my intimate moments. You act according to the situation and as you wish. Why do you cheat innocent guys? Return my sweet moments. She returned it. - My girl gave it yesterday. Ramya.. Angel.. What did you say? - Angel. Are you dumping for this silly thing? Is it silly? Take your hands off me. We spent hours together. Is it fake? That's not love but lust. Attraction.. Infatuation.. You started it. You are my life's happy moments. Don't pretend. Leave me. This is it? You are leaving me for ever? - Yes. Perverted.. My love for you is indeed permanent. You rejected me. Go away. Some one will hug you. He will move closely. Don't lament about it later. - Bye, Jeeva. - We are leaving. - Idiots.. - Convey it to your mom. The curse of virgin boys will haunt you. - Hello. - Hello. Jeeva.. Who is this? - It's me Aditi. I wanted to tell you in person, but I'm saying it now. 'I love you', Jeeva. I love you so much. - Jeeva. - Ramya. Go to hell. I love you, Aditi. - I love you. - I love you too. Ramya.. I got rid of that hitch. When we lose a beautiful girl we must believe that we will meet even more beautiful girl. Aditi entered into my life. I started dreaming about my married life. Yes madam, its Perfenol 250 mg. It's a heavy dosage. Okay. Dude, give me 3 condoms. You still owe me a credit for 17 condoms. My dad is questioning me. Will he question even for such things? Next time when you don't have money, buy a balloon. - What? - Who is she? - You don't know her. - I will get acquainted. - She is from other department. Tell me her name. You will feel bad if I reveal it. Go ahead. Ramya. Accounts department. It's because of you she left me. How can you? Why are you still lamenting about the past? When her name strikes my mind, I want to thrash you. I just shared your achievement with one of my friend. I didn't expect him to spread the rumour? When did I make love to her? Just because Ramya left you, Aditi came closer to you. I have indeed helped you. She is calling me up, dude. I'll see you later. Hello, I got it, Ramya. Don't rush, Sandhya. I have just reached the drug shop. I'll definitely get it. Mr. is it available? - Which one? - Which one? Are you newly recruited? Condoms.. Don't you have vanilla flavor? - Vanilla. Where is the chocolate flavor? Don't you have butter scotch? Am I running a ice cream parlor? It's not available, oldie. - Oldie? Give me the money. - Rs.120. Just 120? I heard that If I buy three Ill get the fourth one for free. Not fair. Sandhya, I'm done with my shopping. - Hello, Aditi, are you alone at home? - Tell me. - No one is at home. - Are you sure? Except granny. Why don't you mention it first? You didn't specify it. Why is she screaming? She is searching for medicine and screaming meanwhile. Hi, Jeeva. Get in. Take your seat. I heard that some boys boozed and troubled the neighbors. Elaborate it. - I'm unaware of it. - Are you sure? Is Aditi in? - Aditi? Jeeva has come, dear. What's it, granny? - Nothing. - This one.. - Forget it. It's time for the medication. You always put me under medication. Listen to me. - Granny.. ...how long will you take rest when you are under the medication? 1 or 2 minutes.That's all. Why? This is an imported medicine. Very powerful. You shouldn't open your eyes for an hour. - It's okay. - What are you doing? - It's burning. - Granny.. ...you must stay idle for an hour. You mustn't open your eyes. Else you may lose eyesight. What do you mean? Idiot. Come let's move to the kitchen. Where are you going? - Granny. - I'm feeling bored. How will you manage her? She has her eyes closed. Something bit me. What did you do? It had been a long time since I last met you. - I missed you a lot. - Very nice. - Yes. Kiss me one more time. Your kisses are very delicious, my sweet sorcerer. I'm enjoying this palpation. Your kisses are very delicious, my sweet sorcerer. I'm enjoying this palpation. You are tempting me, baby. I have a crush on you, sweetie. You make go crazy with your lips. My mind has become a spoiled brat. Your kisses are very delicious, my sweet sorcerer. I'm enjoying this palpation. I'll turn my heart into a aquarium tank. Swim in it as a small fish. My heart has broke the shackles and has gone outrageous. Your anklets creates a panic in me. My mind is after you. Your kisses are very delicious, my sweet sorcerer. I'm enjoying this palpation. Your smile makes me to behave weirdly. My mood swings to an excited state. The liquor didn't get me high. The supplementary too didn't help. I have spent sleepless nights thinking of you. I'm going bizarre. Your kisses... Lips.. Melting.. On cloud nine.. Your kisses are very delicious, my sweet sorcerer. I'm enjoying this palpation. Tell me, Aditi. Jeeva. Why are you crying? Come to Deepa beach house at the earliest. Deepa beach house? - Yes. Upper crust morons. Is it the way to dress up? Why are you crying? I was photographed in an indecent way. Who did? - It's them. It's fake. - Why did you take her snaps? - She was beautiful, so I took it. - I took hers. I took everyone's. Give me the phone. Why do you want it? Give me the phone. - Get lost. There are 10 important things for a man. If you learn the most important one, you can reach heights. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. What's the password? Samantha. Delete it. They have taken 4 snaps, Jeeva. Delete it. Take it and leave the place. Why do you go to such places? I was invited for a birthday party. I felt very bad. - That's why I came here. Bye, Jeeva. Good night. Jeeva. Why didn't you see the photos? Why should I see the photos? I will see it in live. My parents have gone out. Are you sure? But my granny is in. Say that she is in. She will suspect you, if you come alone. I have an idea. We shall invite 5 boys and girls from our the neighbourhood. We shall create an illusion that it's an group study. Be ready. Repeat it. Be ready. Hi, Jeeva. Jeeva. I love you. Be ready. Jeeva.. Leave me. Jeeva. What are you doing? I have to prepare for exam. To study or to booze? I have to prepare, dad. Prepare at home. We have to prepare in a group. Why are you crying? Please, let me go.. You never worried about academics. Please let me go once. I'll be back very soon. - What happened? - Thank you, dad. Idiot. How long can I wait? - Dude... Have you got the liquor It's your debut this is what I could get. What is this? My granny prepared it. Drumstick dessert. It gives you stamina. You are very affectionate on me. You have got it prepared for me. She misses my grandpa. Who is next? Is this what you do, when your parents are away? You too. Jeeva? Come inside. Thank you very much. Last 2 days were horrible. This is my day. I'll have a blast. Granny is coming here. Atleast act as if you are studying! Where is the rest room, madam? Rest room? - It's over here. - Okay. I will have some water. He bit me hard. Have you worked on those problems? - Whose shirt is this? - It's nothing to worry. I'll talk to you later. Hello, my son. Send it fast. Come to my room at 1 o' clock, baby. I spoke to your dad. He is coming tomorrow. I'll be relieved from tomorrow. - Dude. - Yes. As it's my first time, I'm feeling tensed. - So..? - I'll practice it once. Practice? This is my debut. I have no experience. I'm scared. Nothing to get scared. Come closer. I love you. What are you doing to my doll? Give it.. - Nothing. - Won't you spare even a doll? Insane. Why is she lying here like this? I have come well prepared. Aditi.. Get up.. Sweetie.. Aditi. Get up. Why don't you wake up? You invited me. Get up, Aditi. I guess you are my companion for the whole life. You did invite him? Why didn't you wake up? He is drunk. I smelled it. So? Boys behave well only when they are in a normal state. Once drunk, they will behave abnormally. Don't you like that? I'm scared of it. So, I avoided it. She made me suffer by sleeping through the whole night. I was hoping for a good debut. I'm totally done with it. If you can't do it now. You can do it later. - Is it? - Yes. Why are you crying, sir? My girl friend's dad insulted me very badly. Teach me the most offensive word. I have to insult him. !@#$% Boss? Call him !@#$% That's the most offensive word. Pass the phone to your dad. You are a !@#$% Superb.. Thanks. You look like GV Prakash. Greeting, sir. Sorry for hitting you. Don't say 'hit' but 'caught'. It was your mistake. - Why did you take indecent snaps? - What? Yes. That was the point. We are from a rural area. We have never seen girls booze. So, we took snaps. What does he mean? - Ignore him. - Aditi doesn't booze. - She did booze. - He is irritating me. He will get thrashed. - Show him the snaps she forgot to delete. - What is he talking about? Aditi can't booze. Take a look at it. I don't need to lie. Lifestyle has changed. Boys are preforming well at academics. Girls have started boozing. Bye. See you later. Do you booze Aditi? - What do you mean,Jeeva? - Don't you get it? Do you booze? Yes. Since when? 4 months. Why didn't you share it with me? Fearing that you won't allow, When you know that I won't allow, why did you booze? You too booze. Can women do what men do? I will just lose my money if I get high. Don't you know what will you lose if you get high? A real boy friend will not allow her girl to booze. Promise me. Swear on love that you won't booze. I swear, Jeeva. Henceforth I will not booze. Aditi. I'm coming. Aditi has chosen the wrong path. I guess she is cheating me. She is voiding me since I asked her not to booze. Why are you blabbering? She is a good girl. Something is fishy. Happy birthday to Uncle! Happy birthday to Uncle! Thank you.. Why are you looking dejected? Aditi boozes. Just like me. She has kept it as a secret. This is very silly. I can't accept a woman boozing. You broke up with Ramya for the same reason. Don't annoy her. She will dump you. Okay. I guess it will rain. Shall we go the pub? Pub? I have never been there. Money? I'll spend. We have to spend at least on our birthday. Come on, boys. Let's enjoy. You enjoy the most when it's someone else's money. - Happy birthday, uncle.. - Thank you.. My darling. Isn't it a bit pungent? Yes, it is. We could have boozed at the regular place. Why is this idiot calling up now? Hello. Yes. Karuppu Kumar? I expected it. No problem. I'll be there in 5 hours. By road. Manage. Stop it. - Okay. - What's it, uncle? I can't speak English. It's an emergency. I have to immediately leave for Kumbakonam. You take care of the party. - Settle the bill with the money you have. - Uncle? Make sure that everyone is safely reaching their house. Okay, guys. - Bye, guys. - Uncle.. - Bye, uncle. - I like you. Be careful. Jeeva. Get up, dude. Buy me a drink. Where had you been for the last 10 minutes? I went to the other side. There is a boozing bet. - What do you mean? - Yes. - I want to see it. - Get up. Let's go watch it. - Where? - Get up. Look at there. Drink... - What happened? - It's my girl. It's Aditi. Why did you break the promise? Let's go talk in private. Tell me now. Tell me one reason to stop boozing, I'll stop it. My mom doesn't booze. So do my sisters. So, you mustn't. Confirm about your mother's nature with your dad. You bloody. Don't cross your limits. When a man drinks A woman should advise him and mend his ways. How will a family prosper when both partners booze? I can accept if my girl is seen in beach, temple or in a theater. How can I accept her spending time in liquor shop and pub? When I say 'don't booze'. I mean it. Who are you to control me? Good. I was sincerely in love with you for 3 years without expecting anything. You are ought to do it. What's the use? - Have you ever took advantage of it? - I didn't get you. Have you been ever intimate? No. I did try the other day. You slept. I thought you don't like it. You were drunk. I don't mix up drink and love . Who said that I don't like it? Ramya dumped just because of it. I was afraid that it may repeat again. If you want to strengthen a relationship, you need to be intimate. To put in simple words Love is lust and vice versa. Got it? I didn't know this shade of yours. I heard actor Vikram performed well in the movie 'I'. You set a bench mark in acting. You oldie. Don't you have a family? Won't your husband worry about you? You are enjoying with someone else? - Idiot. - You too. Dude, what's problem when a girl boozes? Move aside. It's not a thing to boast of. Men won't get physical if they get high. but women aren't like men. Bro, what are you trying to prove? Now they want to booze. Then would like to get cozy. Will you agree to everything? Don't drag me into it. It's my mistake to love such a cheap minded fellow. Bloody... Boys.. Who is single? Note my number. 99-44-0... 44-44-0.
