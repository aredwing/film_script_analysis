You can't leave like this. - Inspector Cheung. - Let me go... - Pal, - Sergeant What's the situation? Take your hands off. Hey, what are you doing? Why don't you let me go? I can't let you go out and bad mouth my place. But there's a dead body. You owe me 2 months rent. Take my deposit! You can't leave... Don't move. I'm Inspector Cheung. You two are not going anywhere. We need your testimony. What's happened? The residents said they could not see the actual incident. Anyone one saw where the suspect goes? No. Thanks. Victim's name is CHEN, 65 years old. Already been sent to United Christian hospital. He lived here for years. Assailant's name is LEE, 68 years old. He'd also been living here for many years. He doesn't have a steady job. Lee fled after slashing Chen. Where's Lee's room? Over here. Dear. Look at the view. - I will late for 20min - This way. Ocean view. Beautiful. Harbor is over there. Let's see the rooms. Hi, Mr, Cheung. Here's the kitchen. Yes? It's got a terrace. I'll call you back. Come. Let's see the rest. This way. This room also has a view. Come. Good light in here. Now, the master bedroom. Mountain view. Sea view. Market is heating up. China investors will return after New Year. This is a great investment. Interest rate is low... - They can lease it out for - For this one up here, with such a nice view - I'm on my way. - I'd say it can go up to 30K. - I have to go, When will you decide? We should think this over. We need a place to live. Property price is soaring. We can't afford it in the future. Let's talk tonight. I have to go. Connie, I have another client. He's also interested in the flat. Please make a decision soon. Good morning. What can I do for you? Good morning. Why are the lines in red and green? Green line is for banking transactions, including withdrawals and deposits. Red line is... for investment services, including stock trading and funds. So what can we do for you? China investors are leaving for New Year. We should target local riches. Trusts for good times, insurance for bad times. People have to invest their cash somewhere. Just the difference on where you invest it. Our latest unit trust: "Wealth Co. " HK$2 million, This is your quota. It was HK$8 million. Now reduced as season ends. So take it as a favor from me. The trust invests in BRIC countries. Risk evaluation is "High. " Fund department already briefed you. I won't repeat here. Let's take a look at your latest performance. This graph shows the best and the worse. You know who you are. I'll briefly comment. Angel Yes. You and Jeff did great. But Tiffany came out on top. Congratulations, Tiffany. Allan, great improvement. Very good. Keep it up! OK Jenny, what about you? You're 1 million behind. There's two weeks left. No problem. I'll call 50 clients a day. If I make one deal per day, I'll over-achieve the target. Good! Remember our bank's motto: "Clear goal opens new roads". Season's almost over. I wish you a Happy New Year. Meeting adjourned. It was so close, lucky that I could answer her immediately. If she tells me to see her after work, I'm sure I'll be fired. You're doing good business. We're promoting a new unit trust. It invests in BRIC... I just bought a flat. Congratulations. Do you need to take a mortgage? Have you considered our bank? It's taken care of. Monthly payments are burdensome. Well, Mrs. Lee you are just being humble! Your husband and you are working professionals. Still we already got our hands full with the new flat. Let's talk later. Bye. Ok, bye. BRIC? What is it? Brazil, Russia, India and China. No, thanks. I didn't know Indonesia exports bricks. It's INDIA. Not Indonesia. Aren't they the same? Not interested. I want your calendars, and New Year red pockets. What's my credit card points? When would they expire? How do I redeem the rewards? I want to get the TV in your promotional offer. Our card center can assist you. Please hold. Nice tan, Yuen. Three-day trip to Thailand. Special discount. $750, all inclusive. I didn't pay a cent. And got myself a free pen. It's a beauty. It's gold-plated. It's yours. Thanks. Here's HK93.15 million deposited into your account. Discount doesn't come often. Next time I'll let you know when there's another discount. Sure. Thanks. Yuen, I looked into your account. Can I have a coffee? Bring me a coffee. Yes. You have quite a bit of cash in the account. Ever considered investing them? I have a unit trust to recommend. We have a newly launched fund. Bank charges will rip me off. It's only 2%. This unit trust's portfolio is... diversified among 20 stocks in BRIC countries. - 20 stocks? - Yes. If I invest HK$2 million, If I invest online, each transaction costs 2 US dollars. True, but... - 40 dollars for 20 stocks. - Right... Or roughly 320 HK dollars. But, if you buy... That's still less than 40 thousand. Isn't your bank ripping me off? But... we take care of your investment for you. I could take care of you. Business is all about profits, but you got play fair. Credit card charges up to 35% interest. I... I charge 15%, even with bad credits. Call me. I already have your card. Give them to your friends. I have to go. I'll see you out. - No bother - Here's coffee. It's mine. Hi Mr. Cheung, I'm Teresa from MT Bank. We have new calendars for you... I'm in China. Sorry. Roaming fee charges... by the minute. I have 20 seconds left to yell at you. What's wrong with you? Can't you tell this is a long-distance call? I'm sorry. - Sir - Yes? Please deposit the coins into my savings account. Sorry madam. We'll charge a 10% service fee for deposits over 500 coins. The minimum of service fee is $50. So I'll lose 70 dollars for 700 coins? Right. Even pennies and dimes? Yes. That's robbery! Sorry. But this is our policy. Thanks Mr. Huang. Bye. Hi Kun. Sit. Yes? Your fixed deposit is up. Want to renew for another 3 months? HK91 million savings only made 100 dollars in interest. That's less than my electric bills. That's not bad. It's enough to pay 2 meals. You should renew it. Inflation will force banks to raise interest rate. I'm diabetic. How soon will... interest rate go up? It takes time. Just a little at a time. How soon? Depends on US economy. Unit trust offers higher returns. We can do a risk assessment... before you decide. There is nothing to lose, right? This questionnaire will help you to assess risks in investment. The questions are meant... to find out... which investment profile... suits you most. This part... will show which types of products are suitable for you, but it may not reflect your actual investment risks. First question. Which age group do you belong to? A. Above 75 or below 18. B, 66- 75. C. 56- 65. D. 46- 55. E, 18- 45. I'm 60 years old. Next question. How many years of... investment experience do you have? This include long-term and short-term products, and fluctuating products such as stocks, trust funds, foreign currencies, derivative security, or so-called "warrants", commodity futures or stock options. A. No experience. B. Less than 3 years. C. 3- 6 years. D. 7- 10 years. E, Over 10 years. No. So no experience. Kun, the risk assessment says you belong to 2nd category: "Low Risk". What does it mean? It means... you have no experience in high-risk investment. You've only invested in low-risk products. We have just the right products. For example, Dahli National Bond already earned 2% profit in 6 months. Only 2%? We have better choices. Leid Allocation Fund is a solid performer. It invests in national real estates. It went up 7% in value last year. So I'll earn 70/fl interest? Your expected return... I mean you can expect to earn 7% on your investment. Funds that pay dividends... regularly earn 2-3% interest. That's a bit higher than fixed deposits. Your bank's deposit rate is so low. Money is being melted down inside the saving account. I hope to earn more. People in my age don't have income. But price for everything keeps going up. Government's Old Age Allowance pays so little. I need to take risks for greater return. "Wealth Co. " Our new unit trust. It invests in BRIC countries. Risk evaluation is "High. " I don't understand. New start-ups always take higher risks, That's why they gain higher profit. However, since there is no track record, the actual return would be hard to estimated, but return could be 10-20D/fl. High risk, high return. The risk assessment says this product isn't for you, but I can make an exception. The bank requires me to tape our conversation. When I ask you questions, answer "I understand completely". I understand completely. Thank you, Kun, for choosing our bank's product, she has chose... Wealth Co. Unit Trust. Risk evaluation is "High. " Your subscription is HK$1 million.

The three of you don't even have 10 thousand? Life hasn't been easy. Wah always gets in trouble. And he is not your boss, why you need to help him? Let his men worry about it. We're sworn brothers. Loyalty matters most. My junk papers are more valuable than loyalty. Are you going to help or not? Who the hell are you? Here's your money! Take it! What's wrong with you? I make more money than you collecting junk. We're wasting time. Hey. Everything's fine. OK... Come OK... I got it. Sam, you've always been a great brother.

But it retails for $200. Why? It's called "leveraging". Nobody cares where the money goes. Most people don't know how stock market works. They only care about making profits. Market just went up 150 points. We're 70 thousand ahead. Isn't this fun? Jackson, open an account for Panther. It's on me. - Ok, - Wait... Panther, I'm moving my business from China to Hong Kong.
