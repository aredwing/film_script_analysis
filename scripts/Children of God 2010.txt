Because my heart is so black it's purple. Charming. What? I can't deal with this. God was very successful in legislating morality when he decreed the ten commandments, which is the basis of law and order in every civilized society. Despite it's claim, the homosexual community is seeking to legislate immorality. The real issue is - what is the government's position on the homosexual agenda that seeks to legitimize homosexuality in our traditional Bahamian society. Slow. Bye. You going to Nassau again? I'm leaving you. The Bahamas says No! We say... No! We've been sitting around for too long while these sissies try to take over this country. They are everywhere these days. Even in government. But we're takin' them out and I will slay every one of those demons with the mighty blood of Christ. This is what God's plan is - man and wife. Meet me in my office. You are failing. We are going to take your scholarship. Why? My technique is better than any other student here. I'm not going to dispute that. It's what got you in here. But technique without emotion is absolutely nothing. Painting is like Dancing, the best dancers don't go on "skill" they go on feeling, and I see no feeling there. Why do you paint? It's my life. There you go. Go ahead. What is this? Your salvation. I have a house in Eleuthera - you're welcome to stay there. I want you to go, escape Nassau for a while, reconnect with your voice. It will help a great deal with your work. It has with mine. I can't go... I'll be too busy. How will I get there? I don't know Jonny. Figure it out. You better have something for semester review. You going to practice by any chance bro? Shit... I am heading to the airport. Romeo, you haven't been to practice in a while... The guys getting frustrated. We like you, you know, but I gotta give your spot to someone else. Reynolds from Nassau coming next week man. It's just not a good time man... I'm headed over to Nassau for just the day... taking the short flight. It's my grammie's eightieth. Mojo. Look at me man... I'll do it. It's the reason why I here right? Cool man. Cool man... Help me with this bike. You're wrong. I'm a Christian woman. Do it again. We're not wrong. I wish we were. I checked it... twice. You need to have your husband in here so we can test him as well, as well as, well I'm sorry to say this, anyone you may have been intimate with. You know us. There is no way that either Ralph or I have a venereal disease. This is treatable. I've written a prescription. Take the drugs, and in a few weeks, the whole thing goes away. I'm going to be alright. I don't need it. All I need is prayer. I just need to stay prayed up. I'm a believer in prayer too Lena, but if you don't take these drugs, It's going to get worse, and there's a chance you could die. You need to bring your husband in here. Please, take this prescription. Fag alert, Fag alert... Gay boy ray on the scene! What's going on? Look at him looking at you. Does he like you! Fuck you, not me. Like who. He like you! Hold on. Batty Man, you can't pass through here, you gotta go the next way. Sissy boy, you ain't listening to me, GO AROUND my boy. Know what? Come around here again and we will carve you like a pig. Believe that. You've been whoring around. Ralph? I bet that crabby been jumping all over Nassau. Excuse me? Do you really think that I gave it to you. Come on now. Lena let's get serious. I'm in this office all day. That's what I'm saying... You don't say anything... you submit. Slut. How can you say that! I'm the mother of your child. Who says that is even true? I bet that it is someone else's. Ralph just tell me... Who buys the house you live in, who buys your clothes, who buys these panties. Everything you have and ever will have is because of me. And you have the nerve to come in here and accuse me of some shit. Take your hands off of me. It's a happy birthday! It's a happy birthday! It's a happy birthday! Happy Birthday Grammy. So glad you're here. When you gonna let me take my dress out of the box for your wedding. We trying to figure it out granny, it takes time. It don't take all that time. I had three children when I was your age. Different times I guess. The times ain't all that different. Romeo you got any candy? I see Romeo is here. Yes, such a handsome guy. Yeah... but you just got to tame him down a bit. Get him back in Nassau. Make him comb his nappy hair. C'mon. Young people by themselves usually turn to drugs. I'm serious. Carmen's daughter, she was in Exuma for a while, she got herself mixed up in drugs... she nearly lost her mind. Not my son. Then why is he never here? Hey Jonny! What's Happened! Jonny open up! Open the door boy, what's wrong with you? Jonny... Jonny open this door! Go away daddy. A group of anti-gay preachers say they will demonstrate in downtown Nassau on Easter Monday when a suspected lesbian cruise ship visits a nearby cay. Am I going to hell? Why? Because of today. Aunt Millie says I am a big mistake. God makes no mistakes. You are a boy... always will be... The devil is messing with your mind. But she says I'm just like daddy. Nothing wrong with that. Your Dad is a good man. Is Daddy coming home tonight? What did I tell you about your hand? You don't want to go to hell. Do you? No m'am. I just want to say that it is a shame that people don't accept other people for who they are. They don't have to label somebody based on their sexuality. I am a human being like everyone else. The offer still stands, but it's modified. Since you like to do landscape, I want you to do the ultimate landscape. I want you to make your way all the way down to lighthouse point. The southernmost tip of the island, very difficult to get to and paint what you see... exactly what you see and bring it back. Why there? Someone told me that a journey brings us face to face with ourselves and maybe then I can see you in your painting. Hey Romeo. Hey Lena. How you doing? I didn't know you were coming to Eleuthera. Yeah, church business. Couldn't get a flight. Same here. He's getting big. Yes, too fast. Ralph and I can't believe how fast he's growing. How is he? Good? Wonderful. He may join later. I better get some sleep. I'm tired. Too early. Daybreak. Ralph, why didn't you come home last night? I am on the mailboat to Eleuthera and if you care anything about this relationship you will find your way here. Bye. - Move man! - I'm sorry man! You can't drive eh? Move your fucking car out the road. I'm sorry. I can't move this. I can see that. You need some help? Please. I think we are gonna need to change seats. Where are you going? Anna Ross's place. How are you going to get home? Don't worry about me. Lucky for you I live right around the corner. Oh. Ok. Hey, do I know you? You sat across from me on the ride over here. No I mean before the boat. You went to Bahamas Senior High, right? Yeah, you are the painter Jonny, shy silent one always kept to yourself. I never forget nobody's face, man Remember me? I think you got me confused with somebody else. No man. I don't know too many skinny white Bahamian boys and besides, I never forget nobody face man. I'm not white. Well umm... I'll be seeing you. Thanks... Romeo. Ahhh! I knew you remembered me. Thanks for the ride. No problem. Give me your motherfucking wallet. (laughs) That was me at my scariest. You don't have to be afraid to shake my hand. Welcome to Eleuthera. Good to be here. I wish it was under different circumstances, but the Lord's business is the Lord's business. When he says it's time to go it's time to go. So, what exactly do you need? What is your plan? I'm working with the Save The Bahamas. I'm collecting signatures to take to Nassau. I think we are gonna have a mini-rally and we'll need something to print out the fliers. We can do that at the church office. It has everything there internet, printer... what have you. Of course. Always forget how advanced the family islands are. Where's Rhoda? She left. Sorry. We can stay somewhere else... No. It's fine. I have plenty of room. Thanks. So. It's just us two then... The three of us! And loads of work. That's true. So, maybe if you stay a couple of days maybe we could catch a swim in. No I don't swim, I don't want to spoil my hair. You're that preacher right? Not in here. Can I ask you something? You like dick? Depends... on who's asking. Check this out bro. Just got it today. White gals love that freaky shit. White gals? Yeah man... these tourist girls come here for a helping of black doggy bro. I'm just supplying the demand. So what are you getting to drink? Just a club soda bro. Club soda? What kind of rum you want with that? Nah, just the club soda. You sure? Yeah. I'm sure. Alright. Could you pour it in a sanitary cup instead of a glass? Alright bro. You want a straw with that too? Yeah, that will be better. Alright. You are an unusual one aren't you? And he don't drive either. Romeo, Romeo whats going on? Hey Mojo. I'll have what he's having with coconut rum. You my old school friend naughty Jonny? No I haven't. So you enjoying the island, huh? I'm guessing you walked here. It's dead tonight... by tomorrow night it'll be all alive, man. You'll get to see real island culture dread. It's the best and our band playing on Friday... We Tte hardest native band in the Bahamas. We the hardest Band right Mojo? We are the hardest band! You should come. Two nights a week. I bet you don't even like Bahamian music. What you listen to, Rock and Roll? Heavy metal, alternative? Yeah sorry, I gotta get to lighthouse beach. Good luck with that. It's quite an excursion. You need a strong vehicle and my friend you ain't got one. And you do? I do alright. Then can you take me there? I'll pay. Hey, I'm coming. I'm coming. That is for the two of us. He doesn't look like he's in any capacity to pay. Don't do that shit man. So why you hate faggots so much? I don't. But you have to give people something to hate. It keeps them together. You understand. Yeah, I think so. What you waitin' on girl... put it in. Hey Jonny! What happen man? Hey, I want to give you money back man. No it's cool man. I still owed you for the ride. No no. I know. I am not ready for my payback yet. Goodnight. Goodnight. I'm so drunk. You OK? Yeah man. I don't think I could make it home though. Come on. It's me... Nice house. I want to take you to lighthouse beach you know. First thing in the morning... I'll take you. It's hot. Hey... Excuse me? Let Beauty live in this house, that's what those words say. For real, that's Russian or something hey? No, it's Greek. What it should say is Let Beauty always live in our lives. How do you know that? I know something beautiful in every language. You're drunk. Right. But I'm serious. First thing tomorrow I'll take you. And that's not drunk speak. Hey Sister Lena you OK? Fine... just... Have you been crying? No. Allergies. Are you sure? Happens every summer. I think I may have just the thing for that. Some seawater will have you cleared up in no time. Do you ever feel like we are just wasting our time? I'm here to protect my future and the future of my child. I know but when I was younger, I wanted to be a priest because I loved God and felt his love. I thought my greatest achievement as a priest would be to share that with others. Now, I feel like I'm always in attack mode. It's a battle. We aren't just handed over things. Who are you? Excuse me? Who are you? I know I am a Reverend, and I can be a bit shy. I like movies. I love the Lord, but I also love other things as well. I just wanted you to know that. I think a lot of times, we pretend to be this machine gun for the Bible and forget that we are just people. I can't believe what you're saying that. Where is your faith? What is wrong with you? I thought you ain't had no swimsuit man. What you runnin' like that for? What? You got a problem with my little friend Franky, eh? Ain't gonna lie. Maybe he's not that little... Come on, man. Don't go. Let's go swimming. You owe me, man. Remember? Yeah you owe me. I came by the house and I didn't see you. I came to take you to Lighthouse Beach. I just want to have a little dip first. C'mon. Please? You're gonna have to put your clothes back on first. What's wrong? The thing you had in your hand. What, the sea urchin? Yes. Aw, it's so cute. Put it away. Why? But its so cute... I'm serious. What's the problem? Spiny... disgusting... It's just a sea urchin. You alright? Yeah, It's just... animals freak me out. It's not an animal, man, its a sea urchin. You are so fucking weird. I'm not normal. It's been established. You know what you need? What's that? You need to relax. What are you suggesting? Float. Float? Are you serious? I can't float. Because in order to float gotta let go of everything. The baggage, the anger, the fear... and just be. I think you need that. You're full of shit. I'm dead serious. C'mon, fall back. Can we do it without actually touching? It's not going to work unless you let me help you man. It's OK. Take a deep breath in. Fill your lungs with air. Fall back into the sea. Now think of the most special place you ever felt. It could be real or from your imagination. You feel safe. You feel beautiful. You feel like you belong there... Now let go... Dread. (laughs) Dread, you floating. My first float. Nice. Now do you trust me? A little. Good then lets take it up a notch. AHA! I gotcha. Now. I got you. You dirty pirate. Is there anything else to do here besides swim in the water? You ain't got no toys in your house? My daughter's toys, the room you're sleeping in, if you look in the chest. So where's your daughter? She's dead. But they will be girl toys. We're not supposed to pay with those. A toy is a toy. Just use your imagination. I used to play with my sister's toys all the time. For real? Yep. But what I want to know is, have you been on a rocket ship? What? This! Are you sure about this? Yeah, trust me. One... two... Wait. What? Why are we doing this? It's safe. You going to lighthouse point right? This is necessary. We're not moving until we go down. See you below. What's going on? You're missing all the fun. Nothing. Are you OK? Yes. Fine. Allergies. Are you sure? I want to go somewhere. You really scared of dying alone? What? On the cliff you said you were afraid of dying alone. Yeah... I want to be surrounded by the ones I love and be loved. Who isn't? Listen to this. When you die your heart stops, but your brain keeps working for five minutes. And in those moments you dream for five minutes, but... there's no sense of time in the dream world so that dream lasts forever and ever. This is why I paint... gives me something beautiful to think about. I like you. Why? You carry a lot. I want to go inside. It's boring, and I'm getting bit. Just give it a few more minutes. You'll love it, trust me. It's the coolest thing. He's seen a sunset before. Not like this. Just give it thirty seconds. Keep watching. Keep watching... Keep watching... Keep watching... Keep watching. Wow. Cool. You were right. You alright in there? Yes. I really needed to do this. The faucet at my place is calcified. There is a water pump down the road from your house. Oh. I guess the day got away from us. I'll take you to lighthouse tomorrow or Sunday. I'd appreciate that. Youre just so odd. Gee thanks. I didn't mean it in that way. I meant you're strange. Different. I like it. And what are you, the perfect Bahamian boy? I'm far from it. Far. Is something wrong? No. There's nothing wrong. Can I sleep here tonight? Can you just hold me? Look, just so you know I never move this fast... and we just hanging out, eh? Slut. You scared? No. Never scared. You? I am a little. There's no need. I'm open... you can do whatever you want. Whatever? Whatever. I want to dance. Ain't no music, man. Are you nervous? I was told once that dancing is not a skill, but a feeling. You can feel right? Then just feel it. It's okay, keep going. - Feel that? - Yeah. The rest is easy. Morning. Hey you. Ready to go to Lighthouse Point? Yeah. Who's there? It's us Romeo. One second. I'm getting dressed. (whispering) Get out! What? Get the fuck out. Hurry. I'm sorry. What are you doing here? We were missing you, and I had a few days off work so we came. Mom I've been gone two days. Look who's here. What's wrong? Nothing I'm just a little surprised. Mum is there a problem? I know what you're doing. I've checked up. I called here yesterday and no one knew where you were all day... not even your band members. So I thought it was time for an intervention. I'm not doing any drugs! Something is wrong. What is the problem? You really want to know what my problem is? Yes. You don't. I don't need this shit. Thought I'd find you here, man. Mo, what's up man? Yeah man, save it! You string everyone along with your empty promises and you don't deliver. Everyone was waiting on you and you didn't even show up. We believed in this band because you made us believe. - Mo this really... - Remember this. We good. We damn good. We killed it without you. What you trying to say man? Think about it. It ain't rocket science. Goddammit! Daddy, watch your hand. What? Your hand. Only girls hold their hands like that. Boy you don't know what you're talking about. So, what brings you to Eleuthera at this point? Was missing my wife. Does that happen often? You missing your wife? Yes. She's my wife. I guess I better put Omar to bed. Is there a baby-sitter coming tonight for when we go to the fish fry? - Rev. Ritchie said he would... - I can't do it. I have to do some work at church. How are we supposed to find a sitter on such short notice? OK. Whatever. Come on Cap'n, let's go to bed. Lena put your hair back up. You don't have to stay, you know. My family is alive. I'm not like you. Why were you crying that night? Allergies. (music plays) Hello Romeo? Hey Lena, How you doing? I've been meaning to come by. - Oh, yeah, really? - Yes. You know Mum came into town. No I didn't know. I'm sorry, Lena. This my girlfriend, Lonnette. This is Lena, her and my mom grew up together like sisters. So where's Ralph? He's back at the house taking care of Omar, we could not find a sitter. Lena's here for church business. That's right. I'm collecting signatures to take to to Parliament. Gotta get this government to do something. Having a town hall meeting. Hope you can come. We could use your support. Most definitely. And you mister? Sure. See you tomorrow night. Goodnight. You ready to go... You said you were coming... Hey man... Back up man. You can't hear? Cool off. Come around here again or look at him like you have been lookin' at him and you will know. C'mon Lonnette What do you want from us? I've tried... I've tried everything I could do and I can't change who I am. Is it really my fault? What's your fault son? What's your fault? Me. It's not your fault. You are loved. Nobody should ever make you feel ashamed for who you are. You are loved. You are loved, son. Hello. Hello? Jonny... Jonny is that you? I know that all of you guys have been watching the news lately and have seen how Gay rights have become an issue for us once again in the Bahamas. So what we are doing at the Save the Bahamas Coalition is educating people on the threat this homosexual spirit has on this land. They say it's discrimination but it's not. It's us that they are being shut out one by one. They're adopting your kids, using children for disgusting acts that we all know about but turn a blind eye to. Moving onto this beautiful land to degrade it with immorality... We've been blessed with a good economy, so far. But God is a vengeful and wrathful God. And we cannot afford to do anything to upset him. So what we are doing is putting a collection of signatures to take to Parliament, to let the Prime Minister know that we don't stand for gay rights and we don't stand for gay tourism. They say they are discriminated, homosexuals, like our forefathers and they should be liberated. But homosexuality is a choice. It is not a race. I got a question. Why are we doing this? Why are you here? I just want to know what your vested interest is in this issue. Do people really care? Is it me? Or, is it you don't care about this issue? What about what the Bible says? Romans, Chap. 1, Verse 24. "Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanliness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves." You have a responsibility before God to care for your body properly and to use your body properly. It is the house you live in, and you should not do that which mars it or harms it. What about "Let he that is without sin cast the first stone". I have no agenda miss. I'm just trying to live and I don't think that's any better than what you trying to do. I just want to know what you think. I think I have been clear in what I hope to accomplish. How is it wanting to live your life honestly and to be respected an agenda? You are all my people and I don't know what's more destructive. This issue or this rhetoric. You have a child of God here. One of us, Us. And I'm not telling you how to live your life. All I'm asking is that you guys open your eyes and see. I see. The devil's been busy. Let's pass out the petitions. Where you going? What I came here to do. Why are you here? I'm here to see you. Why? Is there another way you want to hurt me? Don't go there, please. What do you want from me? I was thinking we could go exploring. Yeah thanks. I can do it on my own. What you'll learn how to drive a stick? I'll manage. What's your problem? What, you mad at me? How could I be mad with you? I just feel sorry. What did you want me to do? - I think you've done enough. - What did you want me to do? You want me step out with you, is that right? How you think that gonna look? I like you, but people ain't for that here, you know that. You don't want them thinking funny. That's just the way it is. Why's it gotta be the way it is? I see the way you are with people. I don't know why I thought I was different. I learned something though. I can only count on myself. I don't need you. I know who I am. What's that supposed to mean? You think I don't know myself? I've always known... I've paid for it too. You and me, it ain't the same. I come from a world you couldn't even imagine. But hey at least I ain't no faggot who can't let nobody touch him. At least I know I am a man. You don't know a goddamn thing. Good luck with your stupid fucking trip. I am just saying that the boy is too young. He doesn't know anything. He is confused. I don't know who is parents are, but they are failing. Still we should respect him, he's still a child of God. Do you think he was born that way? No one is born that way. They become that way. Proverbs says "Train a child up in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it". That's the way you need to lead children... be stern. I do respect gays but I don't like them. Mario is gay. Yeah but he's my hairdresser. Different. Is it really mommy? Yes. How well do you think you know me? Well. Maybe not as well as Lonnette, but well. Good. And you know your husband, huh? He's my husband. Like an open book this one knows me. Honey what are you talking about? Tonight's my last performance with the band. - Really. - Mhmm. Cause my mother think that its best that I come back to Nassau, and live a normal life. He'll be happier, and him and Lonette could make some babies. I don't think so. Of course you do. See mommy you don't know me at all. You just love who I pretend to be... which is the furthest thing from who I really am. Boy stop talking foolishness. Excuse me. I'm gonna pray for that boy. He seems troubled. Yeah, you should pray for yourself too. Well I think I'm doing OK in that department. Tell me Ralph does it burn when you pee? What? Does it burn when you pee? No. Because it burns when I pee. Don't talk to me like that. What the devil got into you? I don't feel a thing when I pee. Rough day? You don't know the half. I saw what happened last night at the fish fry. I just wish there was something I could do. It was a shitty situation. Mo, you don't have to explain anything. It's my own fault. I feel bad about the whole thing. I could tell you really liked the guy. I'm trying to say you are a cool cat, with a lot to offer. We already knew what was going on with you and we still thought you were cool. I still think you're cool. Be yourself, alright, don't worry about the band or anything like that. Go do you. You know you still coming home right? I'm staying here. Without my support. OK I just wish it was only a drug problem. Good night sweetie. It's too hot for this. Omar... what is this? I told you I don't want this kind of stuff. I ain't raising no sissy! I ain't raising no sissy! - Stop mommy! - I ain't raising no sissy! I ain't raising no sissy! I ain't raising no sissy! Lena! Let me go, let me go! That's my child. And you beating him half to death. You don't understand... you don't have a family. Lena, look at me. He got the idea from me. He was playing a game, Lena. That is your child. He is not your husband. Oh Jesus. What have I done? Be human. Relax. No Let me go I have to get out of here! Let me go. You see, did you some good! Impressive. Yeah little bitch! Wanna suck on somethin'? Suck on this. I bet every time you smell shit... you get a hard on! What's your problem? I don't get it. You gonna do something, eh? I am not going to do anything because unlike you I don't have to bring people down to compensate for my small dick. I've seen it. Small. I should just bust you inside your fucking head. You could bust my head, you could do whatever you want. You want to call somebody battiboy, faggot, you are the biggest sissy I'll ever meet. Fuck you! I hope that with this great show of democracy that we also have a great show of compassion and understanding. I would like to paraphrase P. Anthony White. When we look across our dining tables, across the aisles in church, sitting in traffic and watching the cars passing by. That is where we will find the homosexuals. When we look at our brothers and sisters, our uncles and cousins, even our mothers and fathers... Daddy, Daddy! Where did this come from? Some guy called Romeo brought that over. He'd says he wants to meet you later on at Crazy Johnny's bar. He seemed like a nice fellow. You gonna go? Yeah. I would like to say a strong rebuke and we will rebuke that spirit today. Holy Father we come up against that spirit of homosexuality in the mighty name of Jesus. We RENDER HIM POWERLESS. We spoil his plan for the Bahamas and our children. What's going on Jonny? Are you cool? I wanted to finish the talk we had the other night. I knew you would come around here. Hey where you going man? I just want to talk. Hold up motherfucker. Hold up man! Don't fucking touch me. Don't fucking touch you? What do you mean don't fucking touch you huh? Fuck you Jonny! You think you could say that shit and get away with it. Huh? You're still a fucking sissy. I ain't no fucking sissy. Dread... I've been waiting for you. It's a beautiful day at the beach. Let's go swimming.
