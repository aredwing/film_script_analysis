We mean you no harm. However, we have one rule which you must obey: stay indoors. - You call this living? - Dad! That isn't a home! It's a prison! Daddy, I'm begging you! Dad! Please come back! - No! - Please! Dad! Citizen, return to your home immediately. You killed her! You took her from me! Please, come, Dad! You have 10 seconds to return to your home. This is your final warning. You're gonna kill us all anyway! Five, four... You might as well take me now! - ...three, two, one. - Dad!!! This hasn't happened! This hasn't... happened! Go back inside! Citizen, return to your home immediately. Get back inside, kid, come on! Connor, get inside! - This is your final warning. - No, come off the street! - Five, four, three, two, one... - Stand down! Authorization code 97ZCRS. Request half-hour amnesty. Reason: citizen intends to return home. Authorization confirmed. Past your bedtime, isn't it, son? Please let me take him in. I've got the spare room. I got you these. Thanks. Thanks, Robin. He'd be well looked after. You're an angel, Kate, but, you know, you don't need to shoulder the burden. We have homes for orphaned children, good homes, good people. Couldn't you put him in with one of the... What's the...? Collaborators. Put him in with the collaborat... Collaborate is a word with all sorts of nasty connotations, son. The Volunteer Corps put food on your table, keep your lights on, put this nice roof over your head. I'd appreciate a modicum of respect for myself and my team. Robin, he didn't know what he was saying. I'm sorry. It's not you, Kate. You were a wonderful teacher. I've no doubt you're a wonderful mother. And Sean's a good lad. But these two... What about us two? I can look after my brother, Mr. Smythe. Can you, child? Look at the state of you. - Child? - It's high time we found you somewhere to live with proper adult supervision. I'm 16. I'm an adult. Have you heard anything about my dad? - I've checked the records, son. - He's not dead, Mr. Smythe. I know he's not. I'm sorry, Kate. Be strong. You can take the boy in, of course you can. Go. Citizen, you have five minutes to return to your home. Are you sure this is a good idea? The boy's just lost his dad, Sean. No, what I meant to say is can you cope? Shoes... Citizen, return to your home immediately. I said essentials, Connor! - Citizen, return to your home. - Forget the toys! - 15 seconds. - Just hang on a minute. Connor, get up! - I need all these! - This is your final warning. Connor, now! Five, four, three, two, one. You're gonna look like a Viking for the next four years. Speaking of Vikings, did you know that they used to give their swords names? Head Biter was one. Skull Smasher. That's really interesting. My name is Mediator 452. I have been purpose built to liaise between the Robot Empire and the humans in this zone. Our intention is to study all sentient thought in the universe. When our study is complete, we will leave your planet and never return. - Bullshit. - Alex, mouth. What are you gonna do, ground me? Everything we have told you is the truth. Robots never lie. Your tea, Mom. Come on. It's ridiculous, isn't it? - Sorry? - This. I mean, look. What? Look. Go to hell, you filthy traitor. I mean, no one talks like that in real life, do they? Heroes do, son. Heroes. Not like him. Hit it! Hit it! Gee, what's he angry about? I really hope you find your dad, Sean. Thanks, bud. Please don't die, PlayStation. I love you. Connor, turn the power off. I wish he'd stop perving on her. - Thanks for stopping by. - Anytime. Nothing's changed. He was a perv when he was head of year 10. Can't blame him. He's looking for a new wife, and Kate is well fit. This is my mum you're talking about, yeah? Why does Smythe need a new wife? Morse Code Martin told us that Mr. Smythe caught Mrs. Smythe doing the dirty with another bloke. His son was selling things on the black market at the same time, which didn't help the situation. And now, pfft! Gone. Both of them vanished, and no one knows where. Dead, probably. - Turn the power on, Connor. - Okay. What do you mean by doing the dirty? You'll find out once you've grown a few pubes. Bit left field, innit? No way to talk to your little sister. I'm not his sister. I'm a boy. I'll prove it. Keep your trousers up, that's fine. - Turn the power off. - Come on, enough, Nathan. The older sister's getting involved as well. It's like Thelma and Louise in here. Nate! You okay, Nate? Nate? I'm sorry! I'm really sorry. Connor, you dozy little tit! - Wait, wait, wait. - Man, my gums are numb. This can't be right. You flew, mate. You actually flew across the room. Sean... Look at his implant. - It's dead. - What? The shock must have turned it off. - It's dead. - When he got zapped... But that means... We can go outside. - Yes! - We can go outside! Awesome! Who's next? - Sean. Sean. - Hey. This battery... it's too heavy. It's hurting my back. Grow a pair of balls, Nate. Well, it was your idea to take it out in the first place. I don't know why you're not carrying it anyway. Yeah. You guys know what this means, don't you? I mean, this is just the beginning. Imagine what we can do with this. We should just go home before we get caught. No, we shouldn't do that. I was thinking we start a resistance. Really kick some robot arse. Look, my uncle, he was in the SAS. Taught me some guerrilla warfare techniques that can come in handy in this kind of situation. Same uncle who showed you how to kill a man with one punch? That's the one. Yeah. You don't believe me? No. Alright, that's fine. Connor, get up. I wanna show Sean something. I found this in the alleyway. Sean, what's it say? Sean? Danny was captured after the fighting. All RAF prisoners were put on to ration duty. He was a nice man. He said how much he missed you. After a few weeks, they were moved on, I don't know where. The zone chief keeps files at the school, if you know anyone who works there. Good luck. A friend. Scheie. I'm going to the school, see if I can find Dad's files. Okay, you should all go home. This is my risk. It's crawling with robots. Dad always said being frightened of something's the best reason to do it. I'm not frightened. I'm not. I'm just not stupid. Nate, if it was our dad, Sean would do the same for us. Look, if we're not back in an hour, get yourself home. Otherwise, you stay here, no matter what. - Okay. - Not no matter what, alright? Just... If someone comes, stay in the corner. Alright? It might be dangerous inside. You're safer out here. Yeah, I told you, didn't I? Alright, leave it with Shortarse the Viking. You look after the battery for us, okay? We'll be back super soon, I promise. Promise? I promise. What the hell is that? Did you see what he had in his hands? Files. Come on. Come on. Oi, what do the red crosses mean? I think it means they're dead, Nate. Smythe's wife and kid. Nate, Morse Code Martin was right. Smythe did kill his wife. He's alive, I knew it. I bloody knew it. Region 632-7560. Where's that? 632-7560... Got him. The hotel. Nate, your implant, it's flashing. - Okay, where's the battery? - I left it with Connor. You don't wanna leave it with Connor! You told me to leave it there with Connor! - Why'd you leave it? - Shut up. Shit. Sean, the implants are flashing and we really need to go. Sean! Agh! Sean. Crap. Guys? Ballbags. - Connor? - Connor! Why'd he take it with him? Who's gonna... Calm down, Nate. I just don't know where he's gone. Tits. Nate! Alex! Sean! Run! Citizen, surrender immediately. This is your final warning. I'm surrendering. Look at me, I'm surrendering. Stand down. Authorization code 97ZCRS. You lying shitbag. My dad's alive. I meant no malice, lad. No harm. But if you were one happy family, I wouldn't have a reason to see Kate again, would I? Sweeties... Now, how did you turn off your implants? Look, we're not talking, alright? Collaborator. Coll-ab-or-at-or. Five syllables. That's a big word, boy, coming from you. Since I very much doubt you heard it from Kate, it set me wondering. - He didn't do anything! - I beg to differ. We've been monitoring the torchlight messages from his loft window for some time now. - Leave him alone! - Let him go! Sending subversive communications on an unauthorized channel. A deep scan is what you get when you break the rules. - You let him go, Smythe. - Save your breath, son. This bastard collaborator's been looking for an excuse to do me in. If you hurt him... Smythe, if you hurt him, I swear to God, I will kill you. I'll kill you! Nate. Right, begin the deep scan. I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Hey, Smythe, go to hell, you filthy, filthy traitor. Do not be concerned. His pain will be brief. Please, no! But his data will last for eternity. Guys? Martin! - What was the point of that? - Why? - He didn't do anything wrong. - You killed him. You actually killed him! He isn't dead. Not yet. The subject experiences every thought they've ever had in a very short space of time. The process leaves the donor incapable of feeding himself. He will die of natural causes... eventually. For what it's worth... I'll make sure your mother's cared for. All I want is for her to be happy. You leave her alone! Alone? No. Poor Kate's going to need a shoulder to cry on. He's connected to the network. Excellent. We will search his memories for new ideas. We will know everything there is to know. God! Sean... In this very hall, right, I had pupils, well, monkeys like his lot, calling me the C word. If I were to take them outside, teach them some manners, suddenly, whoo, I'm the villain. Make it stop! Play by the rules, it's not a bad life. Kick up a fuss, this is where it gets you. Did your wife and son play by the rules, Mr. Smythe? Is that why you betrayed them? 'Cause you're more loyal to robots than to your own family? You know nothing about... Everyone in the zone knows. Martin told us all. You killed your son 'cause he was a crook. And you killed your wife... Silence! Be quiet! 'Cause she was shagging half the blokes in town. We've all been laughing at you behind your back. You dirty little... - Come on, quick. - Come on, hurry! Nathan, come on, leave that! The robots are coming! We don't have time! Nate, we don't have time for this! - Alright, keep your hair on. - Come on, get a move on! Boom! - Come on, let's go. - Come on, Connor! Connor! Alex, how often do we have to do this thing? They reboot after 13 hours. I miss my mum and my dad so bad. Hey! We'd have died if it wasn't for you. You saved our lives. Take it easy. Let's find Dad. He'll know what to do. - What about Kate? - What about her? She's gonna be fine 'cause Smythe wants to bang her. - I just sicked up a little. - Come on, shut up, Nathan. Me shut up? Look, mate, you can shut up. Listen, I'm sick of you! Martin's dead 'cause of you! And who's next, alright? Connor? Alex? Nate, get off him! We all had our chance to go home, Nate, all of us. There's no turning back now. I can't do it alone, mate. What do you say? Come on, then, donut. Mr. Smythe. Jake! Guys, I know this isn't the right time, but I really need a wee. There, there, that's it, the hotel. What's he doing? What's that? What is that? - Hit him! - Come on! That's it! Kill him! Balls! Go for the...! He's going down! Get those little worms! What we got here, then? School outing? Oi, pipe down, the lot of you! You heard! Well? I'm looking for my dad. He's a pilot. He was moved here. Look at this one. It's black, like a robot's. Get him upstairs to Monique now. Please, sir, can I go to the loo? I'm bursting. I've been holding it in for ages. Moni, you'll never guess what I've just seen. Bunch of kids just walked in off the street and I think they've had their implants switched off. - Bollocks. - Straight up. - Show me. - Come here. - How'd you do that? - It's pretty easy... - Zip it, Connor. - Easy, is it? You kids won't be so tough once you've had a few fingers broken. Moni, Moni, please, love. They're only kids. I'm looking for this man. It's my dad. Let's do a deal. You bloody geniuses. There is a God. We reckon it's something to do with the specific voltage created by the battery and the dodgy adapter. If only we had something to compare it with, like a Taser or... Schtum, okay? Look, alright... We've shown you ours, now you show us yours. No, look, you know what I mean. There's someone you should meet. Swanny, love, got someone to see you. Swanny here knew your dad. Thick as thieves, they were. And then last spring, they were gone. Swanny, love... You've got some visitors. Amazing. It goes in a long way, doesn't it? Get away, you little bollocks. - How'd he do it? - The watchmaker. Tiny little fingers. Glass eyes. - Watchmaker? - Tell 'em, Swanny. Tell 'em about the stones. The stones... Slaughter stone. It shows the way. The silver lake, that's where... that's where the watchmaker, the watchmaker, the watchmaker, tick tock, tick tock... Monique! Where are you? I need... I need you. I need you now, darling. At the end of the summer, Swanny came back to find me. He got lost in the woods. Heat stroke like you wouldn't believe. Follow the river! Find the secret lake! Find the secret lake! That was a load of bollocks, wasn't it? What lake did he mean? There's no lakes round here. And what the hell is a slaughter stone? It's where the druids make sacrifices. Like Stonehenge. There are some standing stones on the edge of Duncombe Wood, but... Then we head there. No, we don't head there, alright? Look, Swanny's clearly a mentalist. He's like Rain Man if Rain Man was stupid. Monique stitched us up. Got any better ideas? Yeah, here's one: we don't go in the forest, get lost and get sunstroke. I'm not ending up like him. Citizens, curfew is temporarily suspended. Assemble outside for zone chief address. Citizens, curfew is temporarily suspended. Assemble outside for zone chief address. This way, my dear. Citizens, curfew is temporarily suspended. - Sean! Sean! - Oi, oi, oi! Bloody hell. Does your mate ever look before he leaps? Citizens of Marine Parade, I'm looking for this boy. Anyone here seen this young man? This lad here. He was involved in a terrorist incident at Fairfield Bay High. This lad's name is Sean Flynn. Does anyone here know where he is? Sean's mother's very concerned. Sean! I've been so worried. I just wanna know you're okay. If you can hear me, Sean... Easy. Easy, now. Back off. He's mine. Hey, Mr. Smythe! I've got... Anyone says a word, I'll cut their liver out and feed it to the cats. Do I make myself clear? Try me. Sean's mother will be safe with me at the castle, the new zone HQ. - I need to get to the castle. - Okay. Get yourself to the back of the hotel and I'll let your mates know you're gonna meet them there, okay? Now, go, sharpish. Move. Think twice before you put your lives at risk. Curfew will resume in 2 minutes. Curfew will resume in 2 minutes. I'm gonna try and rescue Mum. And then we head for the standing stones and find Dad. - Come on, let's do this. - We're in. Okay. And Auntie Moni made you some sandwiches, little man. Thanks. Thank you. Make sure you share 'em out. Monique said she's gonna see you good to the edge of town. Be safe. Best of British? Just wanna say as well, you know, thanks for helping us out, geezer. Any time, winkle. And... godspeed. Did he say winkle? Straight up that street. Clanker. Get down behind them skips. Down, down! What's a clanker? Get down, get down. Okay... go. - Hey... - Good luck, kids. Been a pleasure doing business with you. It's payback time. Why don't we start with that toe-rag Smythe? Don't wait up, Mon. The Mediator gave it to me. All the zone chiefs get one. It contains a promise. A pledge from the robots. Earth to be. Unsullied by overpopulation and pollution. Brave new world. Cradle Mountain, Tasmania. I've been allocated 100 square miles. It's quiet, isolated, fecund. I'd very much like it if you'd join me there. With Sean? With Sean. He's a great kid. I'd be honoured to be his guardian. Connor... Look... I'm not a monster, Kate. I have qualities that you may learn to like. Love, even. Robin! You're coming with me, Kate. When I tell you the truth about why the robots are here, what they want and how they'll take it... you'll beg me. Look, there's too many and they're too close together. Then we'll have to be fast. - Go, go, go! - Hurry! You have 10 seconds to return to your home. This is your final warning. Five, four, three, two, one. Look at their implants. Look. They're in synch. It's like they're connected. What does that mean? I think I'm controlling it. Awesome. Right, Sean, seriously... make it scratch its balls. And then... and then give it like some of this. - Okay... - I nearly shat myself. I'm sorry. I lost concentration. - We've gotta get out of here. - Wait. I've got an idea. Steven Mayhew? Is that you? Yes, miss. You were such a nice boy in school. Why'd you join the VC? I got claustrophobia, miss. You can put those keys on the tray. - You're a prisoner. - Ha! That's ridiculous! What, did Robin, Mr. Smythe, tell you that? Go on. I'm not sure I can give it to you, Mrs. Flynn. Steven Mayhew, you will give me those keys right now! Thank you. - I should tell Mr. Smythe. - Yes, tell him immediately! Tell him I wanna talk to him! I'm very cross! Now! You should have kept running, son. You're in the lion's den now. No. Stand down, stand down. Authorization code 97ZCRS. Drop your weapons now! What's up, fools? How are you doing this, Sean? Incredible. You've become something wonderful. Bring my mother here. Now! Of course. Kate Flynn! Fetch her immediately! I was like you at your age, son, always rushing into things. - What? - The gun, Nate. - The gun? - Yeah. - You want the gun? - Yes. Reckon you can handle the gun? You want it? There you go. Yeah. He thought he was gonna have it then, didn't he? Please, Nate, come on! - Maybe later. - But I want the gun now. You can't handle it. You'd fly back. - Everyone stay calm. - Mum! It's me, Sean! Mum! Come on! Come on! Sean! - Sean! - Sean, where are you? Right. Alright, watch this. Death to robots! We're out of ammo! Sean! That's weird. Sean! How cool. Death to robots? Come on, cheer up. We're getting to run round, shoot things and blow shit up. It's well sick. Come on, Nate, my turn. Sorry, mate. Unfinished business. Smythe! Go on, run, you coward! Now, now, Nathan... This is for Morse Code Martin. - Come on, move your arse. - If I let go and this thing wakes up again, we're smoked. Try using your link. What is that thing? Its battery... I think. Mum, it's me, Sean! My God! I'm glad you're okay. Let me look at you, my handsome boy. I thought you were gone, sweetheart. Hello. You alright? Hi. We're alright. - No. - Drones. They're headed for the castle. Kate, is it alright if you drive? 'Cause I keep crashing a bit. Crashing? The boy's interaction with our network is without precedent. He will be examined. We must capture him alive, Zone Chief Smythe. - Can't you just lock him out? - To reconfigure the system would entail taking each and every robot offline. It's impossible. But you can track his mother, though. Let me know where she is and I'll... The boy's mother is not a priority. But if we have her, we'll have him, can't you see? Everybody in this zone is now scheduled for a deep scan. A sky ship carrying 4,096 deep scanners is en route. It will arrive in 15 hours and 42 minutes approximately. What, just like that? The operation will commence at noon tomorrow. If the boy is still at large, the first deep scan will be you, Zone Chief Smythe. - You find anything? - Nothing. It's all just names and initials... What if a lot of this was done before everything happened? None of it makes any sense. I'm noticing how bad a lot of this is. Whose tag is Bubbles? I mean, it's not very good, is it? It's not about it being art, Nate, it's about finding a code that works. - Just not looking hard enough. - I'm looking at rocks, mate. Come on, we're running out of time! What is it, like Stone Age Scrabble, you move all the stones around and it makes word or something? Not exactly making it easy, are they? Told you it was bullshit. No. No, no, no. Really? Really? Just looking at the stones, mate. Yeah, that's my sister. My sister. Practically your sister. So a bit disgusting. - Just looking at the stones. - No, have a walk. Have a walk, think about it, alright? You're practically family. I'm looking at the stones! This is... Guys! Guys, come see this! "Cross river three times to safety." Hold on... If we head straight to the river and cross here... here and... here... Stannum Valley. We end up in the middle of nowhere. This is good. Stannum. I think I've heard that name somewhere. I think it's... Probably something boring to do with Vikings. No, it wasn't something boring to do with Vikings, and Vikings are very interesting. It's Romans, I think, Romans. Yeah, Romans. Stannum is Latin for tin, tin's a silver metal, and there's a tin mine in Stannum Valley. - Yes, there is. - And there's a lake there. Swanny's silver lake. - High five. - That's where I'd be, if I was in the resistance. Underground, off the radar. Guys... Where now? Eenie meenie miny moe... Straight on. Keep heading east. Look... I don't wanna worry anyone, but Connor is starting to look like lunch. And when we do resort to cannibalism, I'm bagsying his legs. Shh! Look! Guys, quickly! Look! Hey! Wait! Wait! We don't wanna hurt you! Wait! Where is he? We've lost him. Where did he go? What is that? Is this a Spitfire? Yeah, man. A Spitfire? - Amazing. - Do you wanna look in the cockpit? Yeah. Whoa! Look at that! This is a double bubble! - What's a double bubble? - There's like a few of them in the world. They're like two seats. I think they were used for training. It's fully refurbished alright. She is a beauty. This is ready to fly. Nice. The curves on this. She's gorgeous. Nathan. Guys, come here. We just wanna talk. We just wanna talk to you. We saw your writing on the stones. Swanny told us. Remember Swanny? I'm looking for my dad. His name's Danny Flynn. He's a pilot. My God. I knew you were out there. There was no way I was ever gonna believe anything Smythe said. And I just... kept going back to the place where our street used to be. There was nothing there, just a hole in the ground, a crater. I kept going back. They rehoused us to Fleetwood Street. This is our home now. It's not bad? It's amazing. So you're not the resistance? No, that's over. Yeah, but that's your Spitfire, isn't it? Yeah, I was assigned it before the surrender, hung onto it in case the war kicked off again. It seems a long time ago now. Well, look, you know, I've logged over 300 hours now on a flight simulator, and my granddad, he actually kind of spearheaded the Battle of Britain. So if you need anyone, you know, to help you, I'm your guy. Okay, so you were an air cadet? Um... not really. It's Flight Sim X for the PC, but it's, you know, similar. - Right, right, yeah. - Same kind of flavour. Drone! Drone! - How often does it happen? - So often you'd hardly notice. On the tenth day of the war, they finally figured it out. I was given orders to commandeer the Spitfire, but... A Spitfire, against drones? Mechanical flight system. No electronics for the bots to control. You see, they can access anything electronic, anything with a chip. We stood a chance. And then we were told to surrender. I hid the Spit, turned myself in. And that's when I met Donald here. Next. Incitement to riot. Breaking curfew. Attacking volunteers. It's the game I'm in, it's what I do. And I enjoyed every minute of it. You know, it's people like you, your kind, that made this town such a misery before the robots came. You know what chav stands for? C-H-A-V? Council housed and violent. That's you, isn't it... Wayne? What kind of a cowboy name's that? Always wondered why you hated people so much. It's alright, those wonderful kids explained it all to me. Bet your old lady got the shock of her life, didn't she, the day you decided to grow a pair? But killing your kid too, your own flesh and blood... Even Saddam Hussein looked out for his kids, you rat! Now, the robots want to look inside your tiny little brain, cowboy. It won't take long, but I need to be sure the boy's headed for the camp at Stannum Valley, Silver Lake. Come on! You really think the robots haven't seen the fires at night, the washing lines? They think they're safe and sound, but their time will come soon enough. And your time is now, cowboy. Goodbye, Wayne. I'll see you in hell, Smythe. The scan puts you into a coma. You're dead within a couple of days. It's what they did to Martin, what they were going to do to me. It's how they punish criminals. It's not just criminals, sweetheart. It's everybody. Everybody in the world. One by one, they're going to trawl through our brains, looking for new ideas, whatever that means. Smythe said it'll take them a year to process a billion people. They can't do us all at once. That's why they're keeping us inside. And Smythe knew all this. Apparently, the collaborators won't be scanned. That's what the robots told them, anyway. Robots never lie. We're safe here. Well under the radar. Wait until you see what Sean can do, alright? No, you don't understand. The fighting is done. It's over. Alright, so you've got air speed. - Okay. - RPM boost, oil pressure... Could I... could I press the trigger? Is that alright? - Yeah, alright, just once. - Yeah? Alright. What is it, what is it? Alex! This isn't good. Good morning, everyone. I've come to give you a chance to save yourselves. Hand over the boy, Sean Flynn, or you'll all be killed. - Sean Flynn? - That's Danny's kid! I knew they'd be trouble! I know where he is! Sean! Get up! Back off! Get up! Where is he? Hey! Come here! Come here! Come and get me! Come on, then! Okay... Okay, Sean, come on, mate. Come on. Here he is. Come on. - He's not here! - What? - He's gone! - Zone Chief Smythe, you guaranteed that we would have the boy. This is a costly use of our resources. She's lying, Mediator. Kate, I promise you, if you and Sean join me, you won't be harmed. Robin Smythe! I'd rather die than spend another second in your company! You're not getting me or my son! The mother is not the priority. We must have the boy. Very well, Mediator. Please remove Kate Flynn from the immunity list. She is now a viable target. The cube will drill into the ground beneath your feet. Its thermal bore slices through rock like a hot knife through butter. The ground you stand on will turn to molten lava. You're going to die, Kate. Your husband, your son... Everyone here. Because of your selfishness. Hand Sean over now! People do the right thing when they're motivated by fear. You'll see. Hand Sean over now! 300 hours on a simulator, right? No... You're not thinking what I think you're thinking? What about your granddad, in the Battle of Britain? What would he say? Look, okay, my lot were Irish and we didn't even fight in the war. Sorry, mate, I can't do this without you. Okay, alright, alright, stop! I'm full of shit. Alright? I admit it. Hand Sean over now! Hey... Hey, it's okay, Connor. It's alright. It's okay. Listen to me. You wanna know why I'm not frightened? - Yes. - I'm not sad? It's because you're here, and Alex is here. And all of us, you, me, all of us, we got to be a family, didn't we? We're a family. Why won't Mr. Smythe believe us? Sean's not here! His control is sublime, exquisite. Sean? Sean Flynn, you are a fascinating phenomenon. We wish to study the connection you have made with us. Our simulations cannot replicate it. We offer you and your family immunity, a home of your choice, freedom to roam wherever you want. Defy us and we will order an immediate air strike. There is a 94.6% probability that the collision will kill you. - You reckon? - You are perspiring and your heart is beating 174 times per minute. We know you are frightened. Yeah, well, being frightened of something's the best reason to do it. Your decision is foolish. Goodbye, Sean Flynn. Mediator! Mediator! - Wait here. - Don't leave us alone! It'll be okay. I'll be right back, I promise. It's me he's after, not Sean. - Kate, Kate, you're gonna die. - Please. You're gonna die. Kate, they're gonna kill you! Kate, come here now, please! You idiots...
