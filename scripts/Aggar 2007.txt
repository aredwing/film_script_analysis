My name is Rajiv K Bajaj and right now... ...we have with us the famous Psychiatrist... ...of our country Dr. Aditya Merchant. I think our honor is being wasted and a young... ...talented Psychiatrist is there with us in our show... ...and other than this in the medical... ...profession I think this is a big success... ...that people like you are working in India. Thank you so much for the honor. I am actually speechless, sir. Very wonderful... From Mumbai say this Mr. Janak Hruday... ...is writing that you are God to him. Three months ago he couldn't even think... ...that he may be able to lead life like a common man. Now how do you react to that? I think he is over reacting. May be he needs one more counseling. Needs one more counseling? You are proud to be a God but I don't need God. I don't need a God. I have broken the TV Doctor now these people... ...will take me and close me in another room. Now we will never meet again. Goodbye. And yes please shut the window before you leave. It is good if some windows remain closed. May I speak to Mr. Aditya Merchant please. Sorry madam, he is not in the clinic. Please try on his mobile. I have tried for six times. The mobile subscriber you have dialed is... ...currently not reachable. Please try later. He is not mad like others. When you talk to him he seems to be normal. You know what sometimes I feel that he is not mad. He is acting so that he will be saved from punishment. I will make him get well and take him away from here... If it is that way then why don't you tell him the... ...truth that for what reason you are here. May be it may make some difference. No, not now. When he is ready to listen that time I will tell him. Oh my god seven missed calls. Whose is it? Wife who else. Does your wife miss you this much? Well... See you Doctor, bye Who the hell put the fan on here? Hey have you gone mad. Ritu will you please clear that mess. Sure madam. Switch off the fan. Good afternoon sir. Good afternoon, where is she?

Yes, I like you but that's not all. Two years before you and I had joined this company together. Today I am your senior. You have ever thought why? Aryan I have always thought that I will get married when... ...I am settled or the boy should be settled. I mean, both of us... what do you think we will do after marriage. Mihir is a nice guy. He is our boss. Yes, he does come home sometimes. I never made any commitment with you. I didn't say that I will live and die with you. Grow up Aryan. I have come here just to tell that I have not betrayed you. It's just a career adjustment. Try to understand. In this it is gainful for both of us. What did you say? What should I do? Career adjustment. Aryan, calm down. I didn't mean that. Means when he comes to your home I should welcome him? Aryan look, you are misunderstanding everything... ...that's not what I meant... - Please to understand. You were saying this only. No, I was not saying this Aryan please try to understand. I understand everything. Make drink for him. When he comes to your place... ...I should leave both of you alone. This is what you were saying. Ok, Doctor Aditya Merchant please... ...no but he has come there for conference. He must be there. Are you sure? Don't know, what happened to Aadi, Aryan started shouting. It took half an hour to control him. I think he is losing it completely. Don't worry, I will handle this. Hello, Aryan did you see any dream? No, just leave me alone. What did you see? Whom did you see? Nisha! Did you saw Nisha Aryan? Did you see your past? Again saw same dream Aryan? I didn't see Nisha. Listen Aryan, I need you to help me. I didn't see my past, go away.

How do you know dad? I didn't want to tell you. I did not know that your father is still alive in your memories. One day I got a phone from Jaslok Hospital that one old patient... ...who is going to die wants to talk to me. I was not able to understand that... Dad. There I went and I saw an old man... ...who was counting his last seconds of life. It was that girl's mistake. You will cure my son Doctor. Give him strength to start a new life in your talk show. Dad. And I have promised a dying man, whatever it takes. I will cure his son I will give... ...him a new life to start again. You are very late in remembering your dad. Dad... dad. O.K, it's O.K If you want to do something for your dad Aryan then for him... ...you must open all the shut windows of your life... You will be completely cured in three months and then you can complete... ...all dreams of your father. Aadi! - Yeah! - I don't know how court has given permission to him. I still feel this man can be dangerous. Was! Now he is not dangerous. Let's go, Aryan! Aryan... here. Doctor, money? They are yours. Your dad had kept it for you. But what work will I do?

Sorry, ten days are difficult. I can take out twelve days. You know I am... I feel like Richie Rich. Rich wife's poor husband. Shut up, Aadi. True, but listen, why there is so much hurry for going? After four days it is your birthday. First we will go to our dream house, and then you can take me where you want to take. Janhvi... Janhvi... Janhvi listen to me. What you said yesterday was like that only. Don't start this all again Aryan. - I know Janhvi you did not mean it. I did not say anything like that. - Good morning ma'am. Please don't do like this. Don't create a scene Aryan. Janhvi, please talk to me. - Get in there. What is this? What you want? Have you gone mad or what? Have you lost it? You don't understand what has been told you once? It's over Aryan. Do you understand? I never said that I will live or die with you. I don't love you Aryan. What I did was only Career adjustment. I never did any commitment with you. You mean to say you have not done any commitment with me. Exactly. I have not done any commitment with you That's what I am trying to tell you. No Janhvi, no... it cannot be all over. You cannot do like this. You have used me. You can't do this. I will kill you. What, what did you say? I will kill you. Get out... get out of my life, my office right now. Get out Aryan, you are fired Aryan get lost! I never said that I will live or die with you. I don't love you. I never did any commitment with you. What can we say to memories? It just comes. You never returned. Then why do I think of you. The eyes search only for your eyes. The heart beats, but it is of no use. I am a leaf broken from the branch. The breeze takes me everywhere. I don't want to live without you I don't want to live without you No, I don't want to live without you I don't want to live without you No matter how much I cry. The breath of air hurts me. I tolerated every sorrow with a smile. This pain never soothes down. Your pain seems to be painless. I don't want to live without you I don't want to live without you I don't want to live without you What can we say to memories? It just comes. You never returned. Then why do I think of you. I spend every moment thinking about you. I talk to myself only about you I feel so lonely. I accept all your atrocity. Your cold-heartedness, your disloyalty. I don't want to be happy. I don't want to live without you I don't want to live without you I don't want to live without you I don't want to live without you I don't want to live without you Yes Reetu, I have done the scheduling for the Delhi event. I have put them on the notice board. No... no I will do all the scheduling in future. I don't need any one. Come early tomorrow... We will take it ahead all right. Wrong planning. What do you want Aryan? What do you think you will tell me to get out and I will go? From this office from your life? You think it's all that easy. Whenever you want you can enter anyone's life when... ...you want you can go away from his life. This will be easy for you but not for me. You bitch. Call the police. There is no need. You go from here I will not tell madam anything. But madam... Madam has gone home. Now you also go Aadi, yes, I have reached just now. There is so much traffic on Link Road today.

How dare you... how dare you touch my wife, how dare you? I... I love her, Doctor. She is the one about whom... She is my wife. - I was... She is my wife. You are mad and will remain like that. It is my fault that I took you out from Mental hospital. Listen to me first. Shut up... Shut up. What happened to us in Bangkok, Doctor? Janhvi loves me. Ask...

Aryan Mehta, he has to get back to the sanatorium. He is dangerous. Don't worry, Doctor Merchant we will get him. Namdev, Bhosale let's go. - Yes sir. Well you wanted to be God, for whom? For those who don't believe in court? Why do you behave like a stranger? Why can't you give me a few moments? Why do you behave like a stranger? Why can't you give me a few moments? Why can't you give me a few moments? I am leaving Aadi, bye. Where are you going? I don't know. But by staying here every... ...movement I... I can't see... Aadi you are not wrong. If I would have been at your place then... I would have also not excused you. Won't you take the keys along? After some time it's your birthday. That dream house is waiting for you. I have two choices. One not to forgive you and other to lose you for ever. And? Don't go, please. Janhvi there are not many people... ...who get second chance to start their life. Your patient used to say correct that you are God. I am not God, but I am little selfish. Have a good flight ma'am. - Thank you. - Thank you. Yes sir. One ticket please. - For where sir? Anywhere - You will have to specify your destination sir. Delhi. - For Goa by Indian Airlines. - One minute sir. No, make it Goa. Excuse me, Delhi or Goa sir? He has attacked on Janhvi Merchant... ...Merchant Movie Entertainment' chair person. Police has registered a case against him under section 305 and 306. As per the information we have received... Passengers going to Bangkok by King Fisher Airlines... ...are requested to proceed to Gate number 4 for security check. Taking treatment. If any information is found please... What have you done? Come on get in. Thank God no one saw you. Why you take so much risk for me? You are in love with me or something? I think we will have to apply something on this wound. The first aid box is in this, help yourself I will be with you. Reetu. - Yes madam. We are going to our new house. Yes, everything is fine now. OK, please don't disturb me for one week. I won't be available. If you get any paper from Jackson... ...and Jackson send it to me immediately ok. Sure madam. Can you please tell me your new address? One second. Aadi what is our new address? Ok madam, happy birthday, bye. Bye. Thank you. You want anything. Nothing, I wanted water. I will take it. What are you doing? Where is she going? Aryan. - She is somewhere here. Aryan you will not go there. You will not take Janhvi's life. When I said something about taking life. You are not going there. All right I am not going there. If it was like this... ...then why you bought me here from the airport. Because I... ...but that doesn't mean that you want to take life of Janhvi, Madam... ...and I will help you in this. Please try and understand Aryan. Aadi sir has forgiven her. They are going to start a new life. She is very happy with Aadi sir. She can never be yours. Not in this life. I have to reach Janhvi's house. On the way there is police patrol. Only you can help me to reach there. I will not do anything like that. It's beautiful. Thank you so much. You know what sweety, let's make... ...it like old time. Sitting on the floor we will... ...have hot snacks and beer. What say? I will go now and bring and if... ...you want anything from kitchen tell me I will bring along. You will stay here for some time. Aryan what are you doing, stop it Aryan. - So that there should... ...not be any problem in your plan. Stop it what are you doing? - Quite. Aryan, stop it. - Quite... shut up... shut up. Aryan, you are not going to kill her, Aryan. Some fruits, some vegetables. - Aadi Yes. - Actually leave it don't go. Don't be silly, you will not give food or what. Will you keep hungry on your birthday? Ok then come early. Here I am alone and I am feeling something odd. Then let's solve your problem by making some arrangements. I will ring you up on each and every step. Got it... bye, see you soon. Ok baby, we go. Now I am leading towards the car. I have opened the door of the car and I am in the car. Now I am going out of the gate Shut up, I can see you. Then wife, we will keep talking for the next half... ...an hour until I don't return. Help... is any one there... any body there... help... ...help... help me please. - Listen wife I will ring you... ...after two minutes. Help... is anyone there... help... ...get me out of here. Reetu, oh God, shit. Reetu... Reetu what is... Aryan has tied me here. Aryan, Aryan is here? He has gone to your home to kill Janhvi. What? - Believe me he is going to kill her. Are you sure? He will kill her? Yes sweetheart. He will kill that bitch. He was leaving the city but I stopped him. I told him that Janhvi can never be his in this life. I think I provoked him enough. That's my girl. Why you left me with that mad. He has hit me so much. If I would have not left you with him, how he would have reached here. Now Janhvi's company of 200 crores and... ...insurance policy of Ours. No, mine. You have... I have? You have been killed by Aryan. Isn't it. Why don't you wear seatbelt sweetheart? Don't you know it's dangerous. You have chosen the wrong patient Doctor. First, I got doubt when Reetu saved me... ...and brought me here. No one knew that I am leaving this city. Then how Reetu came to know about it. Maybe she was following me. Second, doubt I got when you forgave Janhvi. So easily God also does not forgive. But I thought that you are great. You might do. But in Reetu's house while I was searching for first aid box I found the photograph of the lady whom... ...I saw on Janhvi's mobile. Hey Reetu where are you? Don't tell me I will have to again meet your Doctor friend. Now I have stopped working on these small roles. Now we have to catch a big fish Reetu... Found out that she was not a interior decorator. After that, I got the meaning of each word said by the girl. I acted like a mad in front of her and have brought her here. I was leaving this city, Doctor. I was not running away from the police, but... ...I was defeated by my love and so I was going. I was returning Janhvi to her husband. But it was written in my faith that I should come back. I have come back. ...not to kill Janhvi but to save... ...Janhvi, to tell your true story to Janhvi. Janhvi close the door he wants to kill you... Janhvi close the door. Janhvi... Janhvi get in Janhvi call the police. Don't listen to him. Janhvi don't Listen to him. - Aadi... Aadi. Don't listen to him. What is truth I will tell you? Janhvi... Janhvi call the police Janhvi you go inside. You have not killed Aryan, Janhvi but I have killed him. No Aadi, you will not say anything like this. I will say this only, Janhvi. But Aadi, I can say that I have killed him for self defense. I will say all that Janhvi that... ...I had to kill Aryan because he had killed... ...Janhvi with a big knife. You bitch. I had brought this mad to kill you but he himself has died. It seems that I will only have to do this work But why, Aadi? Two hundred crores of company wife. If you are alive I will be only called a... ...husband of a rich and successful husband. Poor little Richie Rich. I was searching for a right guinea pig... ...and the day Aryan's dying father called me... ...and told me about his mad son. I came to know that I got my goat. One heiress who is not having anyone in this world. In the eyes of law he is a murderer... mental. I had brought Aryan to kill you. That night I saved you to prove in... ...front of police that your life is in danger. Now, if I will kill you or someone... ...else kills you, blame will come on Aryan only. Isn't it? It was really nice knowing you. Enough Doctor sessions are over... today... ...relation between Doctor and Patient is over. Goodbye Come, your bail has been sanctioned. Earlier some one had bailed you out for some selfish reason but... ...this time really a new life is waiting for you. Thanks.
