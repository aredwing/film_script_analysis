Remember, you're traveling alone. Take care of yourself and don't look for trouble. I know! You must be thirsty. Let's get a cold drink. Two bowls of that! Do you have any hot beer? Hot beer? If you do, I'll pay double. She's pretty. Come, let's have a look at you! Not bad at all! Nice complexion. Not bad! Let go! Stay out of this. You forgot again. Don't be afraid. Keep us company! Dumplings! Hot dumplings! Try it! Not bad, one here! Take the basket. Pay first. You can't eat without paying! What? Damn you! Get out! What happened? They refused to pay and beat me! Why did you bully the kid? We'll beat you up too! It's Hsu Chien! Brother Hsu? Yes! Come on! Don't run! Stop! Hsu Chien! Third uncle! When did you arrive? Just got here. I'm here to see you. I got your letter. This is... Cheng Chao An. Come to my place. All right! Come on out! Third uncle! Please! - How are you? - Third uncle! This is my nephew, Cheng Chao An. My name's Ah B. I'm Ah Lun. I'm Ah Chien. I'm Ah Chiang. I'm Chen Yu. I'm Ah Kun. Cheng Chao An! Come in and sit down. Come on! Take uncle's luggage! All right! It's been two years. Sit, please. Let's talk! Let's all be seated. How are things back home? There have been many floods. Times are bad. Have some tea, uncle! She is growing more beautiful! She's our little sister, Chiao Mei. This is Cheng Chao An. Have some tea. Thank you! How's old Mr. Chang? He fell ill and died five months ago. What about the Chen girl, Yu Fang? Yu Fang? She got in bad company and drowned. Old Mr. Wang who used to live here left a month ago for home to find a wife, did you meet him? Old Wang? I didn't see him. Who can afford a wife nowadays? Take the teahouse next door. They've closed for lack of business. People are heading for the cities. They can't stay in the country. You've been away a long time. Yes! My letter explained why I came here. I know, I know. There was no work for Chao An. Don't worry! I've talked to the factory manager. I'll take him to see him tomorrow. Thanks! Chiao Mei, go buy some food and wine. We're welcoming uncle tonight! Right! Thank you! "Man Lee Ice Factory" You may leave. Remember, don't talk too much. Just answer whatever he asks. Third Uncle is coming. Do me a favor. I'm taking him to see the manager. Thanks! You people stay and chat. Third Uncle, there. Come here. Father said it's an important lot and must be delivered immediately. Don't worry, it's be finished tonight and delivered tomorrow. Take care. I'm off. You've worked hard. I won't see you off then. Hsu Chien! Is this your friend? Yes, His name's Cheng Chao An. This is our factory manager. The manager... We need hardworking people. Have him start tomorrow. Right! Come to work tomorrow. Thank you! Don't mention it! We'll show you the town afterwards. That looks like Auntie Ma. Why are you crying, Auntie Ma? Who tried to bully you? Tell me and I'll take care of him. Where's old Ma? We're broke and he's gambling. I'll go in and have a look. Old Ma, have you lost everything? Yes, you got any money? You still want to gamble? Look! Banker wins! What are you doing? How can you not lose? Loaded dice? Forget it, nobody asked you here. Don't be a sore loser. Come on! You should quit gambling. Here's $200. Take it first. That? I've nowhere to spend money. Pay me back when you can. - Thank you! - Go on home. Thank you! Working here is tough but the pay isn't bad. You can make enough in five years to start a small business back home. Hold it! Please step aside. Troublemakers! Trying to run? You're a nuisance! Only six of you? Come on, try me! Get out! You're pretty good. I learned some tricks back home. Mother gave me this to stop me fighting. Rise and shine, time for work! Get up! You're safe in Hsu Chien's hands. But he likes to champion the underdog. I'm afraid you'd follow him into trouble. Don't worry! With Mother's token, I won't fight. All right then. Take care. I'm off. Goodbye, uncle! I've been doing all the talking. You haven't said a word. Say something. Acquaintance leads to friendship. Don't be shy. Why don't you answer? I'm talking to you! Where do you live? I'll take you out. Let go! Not until you answer me! Brother Cheng! I'm off to work. Cheng Chao An! Come to start work? Yes! Report to the foreman first. Who's the foreman? The dark one. Hurry up, be careful. The one with a beard and pigtail. What's your job? My name's Cheng Chao An. You're the one Hsu Chien brought. What took you so long? All right, get to work. Set it down carefully. Push this across. Don't just stand there, get cracking! Do you want the job or not? What job? Help them move the ice. What is this? None of your business. Damn! Sorry! Stop! What was that for? He was careless and broke the ice. He's new here. Just dock his pay, why get violent? Why did you hit him? Why be so violent? Shut up! Get to work! Forget it! Wait, you two. What is it? The manager wants to see you. Chow time! Wait, Chien and Yu aren't back. Never mind. I heard the foreman say the manager wanted them. The manager? What for? I don't know. Leave something for them. Pass it over! Thank you! Sit down! Now let's have a serious talk. Here's $2000 for you. What for? Listen. We've come so far to work and to earn more money. Did you two discover something in the ice today? Yes! It's drugs. Drugs? How much can an ice factory make! There are more profitable businesses. Since you know now, we'll cut you in. We're in this together now. When we left home Father told us to work hard but to stay away from crime. I'm trying to be nice. $2000 is a lot of money. We don't want it. I won't force you but don't tell anyone. Don't worry. I'll trust you. We're off. All right! Goodbye! Goodnight! Hurry! Have Chien and Yu arrived yet? No! Get to work. Didn't the manager send for them? Yes! Why didn't they return last night? How should I know? Is the manager in? Yes! Sir! Chien and Yu didn't return. Do you know where they are? Why ask me? The foreman said you sent for them. The boss telephoned yesterday and asked for them. What for? I don't know. Strange! I don't believe it! You can go to the boss' place and check it out. Old Wang disappeared two months ago. Wang didn't disappear. He went home to find a wife. All right, get to work. They might turn up any time. Any news? What did the manager say? He said the boss sent for them. If they're not back soon I'll go there after work. Alone? Why not? I'll go too. Don't move! Step back, just watch me. Come on. See? That's the way to do it. You were too slow, left yourself open. Remember it next time. Yes! Father, let me have $2000. What, broke again? I've a reason for wanting the money. You change women every year. I've found one for you. Really? Tall, slim, pretty and educated. Not like those dumb clucks. Where is she? I'll find her for $2000. That's blackmail. Let's have it! Sir, two workers are here to see you. I'll see them inside. You take a rest. I'll be right back. This way! Come in! This is the boss. Boss! You go out first. Yes! What is it? Two workers are missing. They were called here last night. Yes! Chien and Yu work hard. I sent for them to reward them. I'm also promoting them. Do you know they haven't returned? Yes, I've informed the police. They'll be found. You said that with old Wang. It's been over a month now. What can I do? You workers eat, drink, gamble. You get up to all sorts. They've got hands and legs. How can I tell them where to go? This isn't as simple as it sounds. You needn't lose your temper. You're not their next of kin. Be smart! You're smart, work hard. I'll see you rewarded. I don't understand. I'll make it clear: Don't meddle, and I'll make you rich. What? So something's happened to them? I didn't say that. Hand them over! Otherwise I'll report you! I don't give a damn. You've no evidence. Don't think you can bully us. Hand over the men today. No! I'll charge you for murder! Brother Hsu. Ah Chiang! It's 12:30, time to sleep. Hurry and come to bed! Hurry up! The lane is deserted. We'll wait till tomorrow. Don't cry. Brother Hsu will be okay. Go to bed. Brother Hsu isn't back yet. Something may have happened. Chao An, you know the pier? There's a shop there. Brother Hsu often goes to play chess. Go and see if he's been there. All right. Ah B! Yes! Go quietly to the gambling den and watch for anything suspicious. All right. Hurry! Come on. I'll go and poke around. You go to old Ma's place. Ask him to help. - All right! - Hurry! Chiao Mei, stay inside. If he returns, come let us know. Has Brother Hsu been here? No, not for some time. Did you see Brother Hsu? Which Brother Hsu? The one who was in the fight. Thanks! Have Hsu and Chiang returned yet? No, everyone's waiting. What do we do? Ask the manager to call the boss to see if there's any news. I've called the boss. What did he say? Anything on Brother Hsu. And what of the other two who disappeared? He said Hsu and Chiang went to his home but they left soon afterwards. As to the other two, the boss has informed the police. They'll look into it. They went to the boss' place. He should produce them. Right! Tell him to hand them over. That's right! You're being unreasonable. You gamble all day. Nobody can tell you what to do. They may have gone to Bangkok. No, Brother Hsu doesn't gamble. He's our leader. He'd tell us if he were going! You'll hand him over or else. What's the use of pressuring me? How should I know where they went? We don't care what you say. Hand them over or we won't work. Quiet, it's no use shouting. Start work. We'll talk it over tomorrow. Hurry up! If we don't get Brother Hsu back, we won't work. We'll strike! Strike! What's going on? Start work! All right, you needn't get violent. Damn! You hit him! Why did you hit him? What if I did? Get me 336. Boss, we've got trouble! Chao An, help! Where did they come from? Stop! It's all a misunderstanding. We don't need your help. If you want to fight, fight me! Chao An is pretty tough. Come! Come on! What's keeping you? Get out! Good work! Cheng Chao An! Come to my room with those three. Why did the manager want Chao An? Will he start trouble? If the manager is rough on Chao An, we'll fight! Shall we go and have a look? No! He won't dare hurt Chao An. Let's wait here. We'll take a rest. What's going on? Go have a look. Right! What does it say? Cheng Chao An... is promoted to a foreman! What about Ah Sheng? He's demoted to third class! That's being fair! Now Chao An is our chief. He's our brother from home. Here comes our big brother! Congratulations! Marvelous! Brother. Come here! Stop! Disperse! Split! Ah Kun, why are you so happy? Don't you know! Cheng Chao An is now a foreman. How did that happen? Tell me. The manager says he's able and just. Able and just! What happened! We had a fight with foreman Sheng. He slapped me, and Ah B fought him. He called over 10 men to beat us up. Cheng Chao An suddenly stepped in. He's quick and skilled, he floored them all. The manager promoted him. Why did you fight a foreman? He tried to make us work. He hit me, and the fight started. Did you refuse to work? We asked for our four men back and refused to start work otherwise. There's no news of Brother Hsu. All you know is how to make trouble, you don't really care about Brother Hsu! Chiao Mei, don't cry. I'll talk to the manager tomorrow. If he won't hand them over. I'll show him no mercy! Well? He said he's reported to the police. If they don't return today, he'll come to the station with me. All right. Let's start work. Time to eat. Wait! Chao An went to the police station and hasn't been back. We should wait for him. Wait awhile! Sit down! The boss says he can't make it. He's having dinner with the police chief. Any news of Brother Hsu? Don't worry, the chief is a good friend. They'll do everything to find him. We'll be notified once he's found. Come, let's eat. Manager! You're coming! Come in! Come in, and sit down! Let me introduce you. This is Wu Man. This is Ting Kuei. This is Rose. Our foreman, Cheng Chao An. Foreman, a toast to you! Right! Mr. Cheng, I return your toast! Good drinker! You're a good drinker. Let this dinner make peace for you. We're all colleagues. You have a big future, Chao An. Thank you! Bottoms up! Come, let's eat! That's nothing great. Still waiting? Go to bed, don't catch a chill. Ah Kun, I'm afraid. What of? Five who lived here haven't returned. Could Brother Cheng also... Don't make wild guesses. He'll be all right. I'm worried. Why are you crying? I know you like him but we don't know much about him. He's young, don't worry about him. Leaving in such a hurry? Sorry! Where could Chao An have gone? I wonder! He's coming! Chao An! You didn't return last night. Where did you go? We were worried sick! - What did the police say? - Well? Police? I didn't go! Didn't go? Why not? Where did you go? The manager asked me to dinner. Dinner? So you forgot about Brother Hsu? No. Don't forget how you got this job. Listen to me. You forgot all about it! Let's start work. - Come on! - What's the rush? One dinner, and your head's all swollen. Acting high and mighty just because you know the manager. Go brownnose him. I work for my keep. Sir! Who is it? Cheng Chao An. What is it? There's no news of Brother Hsu. The workers are all worried. I'd like to see the boss. All right. I'll call him, go after work. All right! Hsiao Chun! What is it? There's a man coming to see me. We'll have to put up a show. Show? Who are you? A foreman from the factory. What's your name? Cheng Chao An. Thanks! You may go in. Don't bite! Come! Boss! - Are you foreman Cheng? - Yes! Sun called me about your visit. Sit down. Be seated. I know why you came. Is it about Hsu Chien? Idiot, don't be so careless! Sorry! I'm very unhappy. I've lost a lot, too. How so? I've been here so many years many people envy my success. They're using this opportunity to attack me. You'll hear a lot of rumors about me. Don't believe them. I treat the workers as my children. I advise them to be thrifty. We're all from faraway places, we should work hard and save money. Listen, I know you're capable. Thank you, but about them... Don't worry, I've told the police. They'll find them. Father! We looked everywhere, no trace. You're useless! Up to no good all day. You can't even do one thing right! Why are you home so early? It's almost dark. You'll look again tomorrow. Don't come home if you don't find them! Boss, I'll take my leave. Fine, ask them not to worry, I'll do everything I can. Okay. We got away with it for now. We must take care of the factory. You don't need to know so much, Cheng is not a simple guy. - Keep an eye on that fellow. - Yes. Father come! I've found where the girl is. She's beautiful! I'll get hold of her tonight. I'm looking forward to it! Have you eaten? Thank you! What? The boss kept you for dinner? No. What did he say? That he'd told the police? And they'll let us know if they're found? Rubbish! A foreman eating cold food? That's tough! Yes, a foreman isn't used to such frugal living. Ah Kun, why do you say that? I don't like him. We'd best keep away from him. It's no use being nice to him. We'll tell him to go when Hsu returns. Ah Kun is a good man but impulsive. Don't be angry. I won't! They don't understand me. In time, they will. Bear up! I'm going to work. Better go home. Mr. Cheng, are you looking me? Have a seat. What's making you unhappy? Some workers have disappeared. There's been no news of them. You must take care yourself. Your boss is tricky. Think! How much can an ice factory make? Do you know how he made his fortune? How? There's something in the ice. How do you know? I was their maid. Look! He did this. I knew you'd come here. What have you been up to? So what? I'll kill you! Chiao Mei! Chiao Mei... Chiao Mei! Mother told me not to get into trouble. But now I'm in trouble, what am I to do? If anything happened to me what would she do? She's over 70. No, I better go home. I only got to know them here. They treat me as one of their own. What am I if I don't avenge their death? I want to kill this cold blooded monster! I don't care what becomes of me. But I'll not let their deaths be wasted. Revenge! I'll get revenge! The young master didn't return. Find him and call me. Yes! It's none of your business. Come out. It's none of your business. The boss and the foreman are fighting. Run! Why should you save me? Never mind, run! Over there! Across! Brother Cheng! Translation: dima360 [notabenoid.com]
