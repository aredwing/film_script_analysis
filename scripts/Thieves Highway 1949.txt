Where's Polly? I called her from the station. - Sh-She not here. - Aw, she don't like you. What are ya doin' home? I could hear him singing three blocks down the street. - Ha, ha, ha, ha! - "Ha, ha, ha, ha!" Look, presents for everybody. - Presents? - The big box is a lamp from India. - Oh, India! - China. Japan. Africa. Melanese Islands. Ho-ho, you hear, mitera? Man of the worid, Nico. I bet he the best mechanic on the ship. Shoot a rod, they send for me. Blow a valve, they send for me.

Oh, isn't she pretty? Oh, thank you, Nick. I like it very much. - I'll use it as a pin cushion. - The finger. Keep your eye on the finger. Oh, Nicky! Oh, it's beautiful. Why, it must have cost a fortune! - Hey, what do you think of that? - Oh, that's wonderful! 1,800 smackers. More than enough to go into business with your old man. He's got an option on the vacant lot next to the drive-in. Hey, Jive-boy. These I got for Pop. All the way from China. Mandarin slippers. The Chinese have small feet. I had a tough time... trying to get a size to fit your number 12's. Here, try them on. See how they fit. What's the matter? Did I say something bad? All I said was, try them on. I can't try on, Nico. Why not? - Pop  - Cover me, Nico. What happened? - Tell me, what happened? - Nico  I came in here like a clown. I couldn't tell. He plays the phonograph, he sings  Oh, what I'm gonna do? I don't lose my head, just my legs. What happened? Tell me what happened. I get a nice truckload tomatoes. Earlianas, first of season. I leave with produce dealer. Mike Figlia. In San Francisco. On consignment. I go back for money. He say, he sell good, for good price. "Come on. We have party," he say. "I buy you drinks." I go for drink. Two, three glass wine. I say, "Now you pay me money." Mike Figlia say, "Sure, I'm gonna pay. Have another glass wine." Two fellas from market, they say, "Come on, pop." So, we drinks lots of wine. I laugh, I feel good. I have good time. I think how happy Mama gonna be when I come home... throw money like leaves all over the floor. Don't remember no more. All I know is, here it hurt. It hurt. For long time, he don't believe his legs gone. He think new legs will grow. Don't you know how it happened? They find truck turned over in ditch. Yeah, they find me, but they don't find money. I think Mike Figlia, he don't pay. I telephone Mr. Figlia in San Francisco, he say he pay. - He no pay. - My father saw a lawyer. - He say, forget all about. - I never forget. - The lawyer got in touch with Figlia. - Two witnesses say he pay. I say, he no pay! All right, Ma. Leave him alone. Polly, I'll see you tonight after you get home from work. Sure, Nicky. So long. Pop, those two witnesses... - did they work for Mike Figlia? - Yeah. They big crook, too. They big liars. - He's right, Mom. He never got paid. - Uh-huh. Yeah. They just got him drunk, put him in his truck and sent him home. On the way, he probably fell asleep at the wheel. Where's the truck? Insurance company fix. I got no legs. I don't need it. I sell it to trucker named Ed Kinney. Ed Kinney, he don't pay no money. Just take the truck and give promise. Ah, you're doing good all around, ain't you, Pop? - Where's this guy live? - Why, Nico? I'm gonna get that truck, go up to San Francisco and gouge your money... - out of Mike Figlia's carcass. - Is no use, Nico. I wanna see Figlia, Mom. Where's the truck? Uh, maybe Mom is right, Nico. Maybe Figlia pay. Maybe somebody steal money from truck after I have accident. Where does Kinney live? 1600 block, Elm Street. But you leave Ed Kinney alone. He know more about crop than anybody in state. He pay me. You're a pushover, Pop. Hey, Get-Rich-Quick, somebody to see ya. - Tell him I'm busy. - He says he can't see ya. - Tell him I can see him. - Better come out, honey. Looks like the man's gonna stay. - Yeah? - My name's Nick Garcos. You haven't kept up the payments, so I'm takin' the truck back. - You don't have to do that. I'll pay. - When? Day after tomorrow, all the money I owe in one lump. And a box of cigars for your old man. My old man falls for that stuff, but not me. Where are the keys? Tell him I need the truck. I got a big haul coming up. - Can I have the keys? - I bought this truck from your old man. I'll talk to him. - I'll square everything with him. - You'll talk to me. - Where are the keys? - Look, kid. This bargain your old man sold me... I been keepin' it together with spit. The universal's shot, the rear end sounds like she's comin' apart. I'd be glad to give it back to him, but I need it. For one more haul. Just one. If your old man's worried about his money, tell him Ed Kinney's got the first load of Golden Delicious apples. If you got money to buy apples, why don't you pay for the truck? I haven't got a dime, but this crop is so hot... two guys are buyin' me a load, just to find out where it is. You talk just like my old man used to. Always blowing off a lot of smoke. Come on. Let's have the keys. You'll have to kick my face in to get 'em, brother. I know when I've got a good thing. I've been hauling a long time. And this is it. I found this orchard where they come ripe early. A south slope that catches the sun. Golden Delicious apples. It's like money in the bank. Ask your old man if any produce dealer in the country... wouldn't give his eyeteeth to get 'em. Would they, um  Would they go for them in San Francisco? They eat apples in Frisco. They ain't snobs. They'd grab 'em up like that. - You think Mike Figlia might be interested? - That chiseler. He'd be so crazy to get 'em, he might even make a straight deal  It's too bad your old man is laid up. He'd go in with me if he had 1,200 bucks. Then I wouldn't have to go in with these other two guys. They ain't no friends of mine, but your old man, I like him. He used to be a good trucker. We could buy two loads of Golden Delicious  one for him and one for me and make a killing. Hey, Doc! The two guys I was telling you about. I wish I didn't have to go in with them. They're sharp. I got a hunch they're gonna bounce me after they find out where the apples are. Hey, you beanpole, you long drink of When are you gonna get that gas-buggy heated up, huh? Maybe I could raise 1,200 bucks. - Hi, Ed. Got her all set to go? - She's ready to roll. That's our partner, boy. That's our partner. After we pick up the money tomorrow noon, we're on our way. Tomorrow's too late. You should have been here yesterday. - Wait  - We ain't goin' nowhere. The deal's off. - What? - I don't hear ya. I don't hear ya! The farmer called up. Said he sold the whole orchard to a big shipper. He can't do that! You said he made a deal with us! Yeah, you can't trust nobody these days. How do you like that? We get kissed off before we even get a chance to pucker up. I know how you feel. Well, something may come up next week. Keep in touch with me. I got my eyes open. Great, great! I should have known it when I had that dream. You know I had a dream that I had a handful of $1,000 bills? - And when I woke up  - No. It don't sound kosher. It don't sound kosher. - What do you mean? - He's takin' it too easy. What do you want him to do? Wiggle in the dirt there and have convulsions? That's just it. He don't feel bad enough. We'll need another truck. I know a guy who's stuck with a lot of war surplus jobs. Triple-A Garage. That's where they got theirs. Just give 'em a down payment, and we're in business. - Tell 'em Ed Kinney sent ya. - That was a dirty trick you pulled on those guys. Kid, this ain't no lace pants business. It takes tricks to get what you want in this game, and I know 'em. You just buy the loads. I'll sell 'em. You pull a trick like that on me, I'd climb all over your neck. You want to back out? Any time you like. - When do we go for the apples? - Tonight. After you pick up the truck, go home and get some shut-eye. We'll be on the road for 36 hours. - You think you can make it? - Sure, I can make it. But remember, no tricks. Now why would I want to pull a trick on you? Because I'm a pushover, too, like my old man. I come down here to pick up his truck, and I wind up blowing all my cash. I wanna tell you one thing, I worked like a dog for that dough. Gyp me, and I'll cut your heart out. Thanks. I'll remember that. Havel! What you do? Pick the apples. Olga, Fedya. Maria, he's picking twice as many apple than you do. Truckman waiting. Whoa! - What's the matter? - Universal. Sounds like it's ready to go. - So that's what I heard. - Ah, I was afraid it wouldn't hold out. - Look at that thing. - Oh, great. - What do we do now? - Don't get the shakes. I been keepin' this together with spit, and I'm ready to spit all the way to the market. Uh, I'll need 1,200 bucks. Will you get your end wrench and try to tighten those bolts? Just the front ones. I'll go down and pay off the old geezer. My wife, she say to tell you, dollar a box. - That's right. - Thank you. Thank you! Good luck! Have a nice trip! And sell good my apple! Papa! Hey! Wait! Hey! Stop! - Don't go! Wait! - Truckman! Wait a moment. You didn't count right. You make mistake. You make mistake. This only 900. - That's right. Six bits a box. - Six bits a box? - "Six bits"? - Six bits cojest 75 cents! Seventy-five cents? You cheat. Six bits is all I'm gonna pay. If you don't like it, you can have your apples back. - What you say? - I busted my truck pulling up your hill. I don't care whether I haul 'em or not. You take your money! And I take my apples! - Seventy-five cents! - Papa! Here! Here! You cheat! Seventy-five! - Papa! - Seventy-five cents, huh? Here! All this cheating! You! Seventy-five cents! Nice going, Ed. Nice. - Nah, he cheat! - He says one dollar. He pay six bits. Saves two bits a box. That's a lot of dough. - 300 bucks. - Sure, we could lose our shirts at a buck. - What I am going to do with all these apples? - He got no truck. They gonna rot. - Give him his money. - What? - Go ahead. - We'll need it for that shot universal. If the universal goes out, we'll park your rig and come back later. - Sure, we got lots of time. We're on a tour. - You made a deal. Give him his money. Every john in the business will know about apples by tomorrow morning. - They'll flood the market. We'll be peddling ours out of our hats. - Give him his money. Thank you. Thank you. You good boy. I tell from your face. Here's five dollars for boxes he throw off truck. You almost saved me 300 bucks. - Or weren't you gonna tell me? - Maybe you'd like to wash up the deal we made. Look, I buy the load, you sell 'em. That still goes. - No grudge? - No grudge. Let's get the top on. - You go on ahead. I'll tail ya. - Maybe I'd better tail you. - Just in case you break down. - Nah. You'd lose time that way. You get south, fast. - We're hauling north. - Thanks. I thought the deal was, you buy the loads, I sell 'em. You can have the rest your way, but this first run we're making north. Okay, it's your dough. Hello, hello. Uh  Well, lookee, lookee, lookee. Hi! Hey, Pete... ain't we seen these boys someplace before? Yeah. Yeah, they do look familiar. Well, what do you know? They got apples. - What's the idea of following us? - Ha! That's very funny. Pete, some guys has always got a suspicious nature. Why do fellas have to be like that? We weren't following them. It's just fate. I don't want you to rupture your brain, but did you ever stop to figure... if we all showed up with apples, we'd all come out with peanuts? We understand that. We don't want to cool off your load. Nah, that's the last thing we'd want to do. - Listen, chiselers  - Okay, okay. It's free enterprise. We all want to make a buck. We're gonna haul north. You guys haul south. Now, there's a fella's got good manners. Go on, Slob. So long. Good luck. Maybe we'll see you again sometime. - Listen, "Free Enterprise." You know where they're gonna haul? - Uh-huh. - Where? - San Francisco. They wanna go where you go, figure you got the nose for a buck. At least we got the jump on 'em. We're all loaded. But they can spell each other. We gotta drive alone. Get in and get goin' fast. Watch it goin' down the hills or you'll blow a tire. You got an overload. - I'll watch her. - If you get sleepy, stick your elbow out the window. - Cool off your blood, wake you up. - Right. When you get to Frisco, don't talk to nobody about the load. They'll see you're green, they'll murder you. You hear? Wait'll I get there. I won't be more than 40 minutes behind. - I'll be waitin'. - Right. Forty-five, 50. We got 150 bullets. Well, that won't buy too many apples, but we'll make some change. Maybe we'll do better than that. Listen to that guy's truck. Sounds like she's beatin' eggs. Yes, Slob, we're gonna make out fine! What's from beatin' eggs? Let's grab the apples and get goin'. - There's no hurry, Slob. No hurry now. - What are you  He Hel  Maybe you better tail me, huh? Hey, Nick. Nick! Nick! Nick, try to get your head out of the sand. Nick, get your head up! Nick. Nick. Come on. Get up. - Hi. - Are you all right? - Yeah. I'm okay. - Come on. Let's get over to my truck. Hey, hey! - Can you stand there for a minute? - Yeah. Sure. - Let's take a look at that neck. - No, I'm okay. Let's get goin'. Sure, you're okay. But I gotta fix that tire first, don't I? I better put something on that neck, too. Let's get in front of the light. There. Let's clean you up a little. Ah, it's good. I'm glad you've got a fast truck. Like the fella says, I got here, didn't I? Don't forget to clean behind the ears. Listen, I knew a guy once walked around for a full week with his neck busted. - How's it look? - Swing your head around. Go ahead, try it. - How does it feel? - Great. - Haven't got a bandage. - There's a handkerchief in my back pocket. No, I'll use mine. Hey. - What? - I bet we look silly, sitting here. Yeah. - You think you'll be able to drive? - Sure I can drive. - Let's change the tire. - Oh, no. You'll watch. Next time you'll know better than to try to jack up a truck with the back of your neck. - Ed? - Yeah? I'd be a goner if it wasn't for you. Yeah. Hey! Hey, you. Hey! What do you do with a guy Them guys ain't gonna let you sleep, so how 'bout moving this heap out of the way? Hey, there, sonny boy. How long do you think you're gonna keep this truck parked here? - Just for a little while. - Well, that happens to be a loadin' platform, sonny. Well, I'm only going around the corner to check on some prices. Oh! Say, that looks like a mighty fine load of apples you got there. - Go ahead. - Help yourself. - Can I have some of that? - Sure. - Get the guy a paper cup. - Aw, never mind. Thanks. Wanna try it? That's asparagus packin'on ice. Hey, Mac. What do you think of this? - Hey, that's a nice apple! - What do you think it's worth? - Huh? - What do you think they're worth? - I don't know. Ask the boss. He'll be back soon. - Thanks. - Stop bargaining. Take it or leave it. - I'll take it! Too late. What are we gonna do with you? Juice is juice. Too dry. - How do you like that? - Are you selling or pricing? - What do you think they're worth? - A lot more than I can give. People who deal with me, little hole-in-the-wall grocery stores, can't afford to pay off. - Where can I find Mike Figlia? - Mike Figlia? - What'd he say? - He says, Mike Figlia stinks. - Oh. Where can I find him? - You're practically in front of him now. - Oh. - Hey! What do you want to get mixed up with him for? - There are plenty of straight outfits on the street. - Thanks. - What do you mean 12 bucks a crate? - That's Golden  I don't care if it is Golden Bantam. People ain't gonna pay two bits an ear to eat this stuff. I give you 10 crates at 12 and five at eight and a half. You're so nice to me. I'll tell ya what. I'll take it if you make a deal on 20 boxes of Golden Delicious. Tell you what. I'll give you just one bite. I ain't got no Golden Delicious. No apples, no corn. If you're gonna take me, it's gotta be worth it. Hey, wait a minute. How about 20 boxes of strawberries? You can twist my arm on the corn. I want apples. Apples? What do you want me to do, pull 'em out of my hat? What? Huh? Come back later. Might be a deal on the apples. - Hey! Jocko. Gonna park there long? - Is there a law against it? No. But I don't like it. Hey, Fig! Maybe he's got something you can use. I don't do no business with no wildcat peddlers. What do you know? Apples. - They're not for sale. - How's that? I said, you don't do business with wildcat peddlers. Get your truck out. It's in the way. Anything wrong? My tire's flat. Tire's flat? I got stuff movin' in and out of here all the time. Well, here. Maybe you can pump it up faster. Hey, Dave! Give the man a hand. Hey, what do you say, Charles? You think we may be able to use them? I'd have to see the entire load. That's Charles for ya. Got a great future. Never wants to take a chance. I'm willin'. - Aren't you afraid you'll lose your shirt? - I got plenty of shirts! What'll you take for the whole load, as is? Cash on the line. - Help him out, Charles. What do you think it's worth? - Hard to say, Mr. Figlia. Now, if they're all like this one  - Call that an apple? - What's the matter with it? - It's pulpy! It's not worth bringin' in. - Tire won't come up. I keep pumpin', but she won't come. That's a shame. Yeah, it looks like you're gonna be stuck here for a while. If you're a nice boy, I might be able to handle this load. - What'll you pay? - I don't know. It's kinda early for apples. - First crop's always pulpy. - Yeah, you know? There's no demand. Hey! Hey! Whaddya got there, more peppers? - I can't give 'em away. - You ordered them. Put 'em in the back. Unless you want to dump your load now, I'd take 'em on consignment. Consignment? That's the kind of deal you like to make on tomatoes, isn't it? Sign this, Mike. We're waitin'! - Hey. How 'bout a straight sale? - How much? Two bucks won't hurt too much. - That's $1,200. - Cash. Right in your fist. Sounds pretty good. I'll talk to my partner when he gets here. Hey! Yeah. You gotta sell to someone. Might as well be me, huh? I'll be glad to sell to you. You're a square guy. You offered me a fair price. - You got a good reputation. - Okay, okay. Get your truck outta here. I can't. Somebody cut the tire. Hey, Dave. Call up the Circle Garage. Tell 'em to send a tow truck. - Get him outta here. - Figlia, you're used to pushing around old men. Touch my truck, and I'll climb into your hair. Ah. The old man was easy. This kid's tough, huh? Want me to call the Circle Garage, Mr. Figlia? - What for? - For the tow truck, to tow him out in the street. You know, sometimes I'm worried for your future, Charles. I want that truck right where it is. See? See? Hey, Mike. See? Havin' trouble, Doc? Hey, Slob. Come on over here and give him a hand. - Hold a light for a fella. - Yeah. Yeah, once a universal conks out on ya, you're dead. - When that hot sun hits your load tomorrow  - Brother, baked apples! Lots of room on our truck. We'll toss 'em on for ya. We'll get you to town in a jiffy. Anything to help a neighbor. And all it'll cost ya is half of what you make, bud. - Hey, there's a spot on your chin there. - Aah  - Hey! You! What  - Just wanted to give you a helping hand. - That guy started from scratch. - And he's still scratching. You're not such a bad egg. Everybody just got you wrong. Two hundred bucks! "You're a crook," I say. And he says, "When you insult me, look me in the eye." Why don't you get up and give the lady a seat? - What'll you have, lady? - Black. - Match? - No match. - Looking for someone? - Yeah, my partner. You look tired. You'd be tired, too, if you drove 400 miles without sleep. - Hey! - Why don't you look where you're goin'? - All right, all right. - Come on. Get outta here. You can sleep here Sundays. Market's closed then. You wanna come up to my room and rest? - What? - I'm the friendly type. No, I'm waiting for my partner. I'm looking for his truck. You can see the market from my window. No. I think I'll wait here. Sweet dreams. Hey, those are potatoes, not coconuts! All right, all right, all right. All right, let's go. Hey. You talked me into it. What do you got? A penthouse? - Here we are. - Oh. - Got a match? - No match. - It isn't the Ritz. - No, it's a nice place. Ahh! Hmm. Soft. Ever try sleeping in a truck? You get the steering wheel in your ear. You can sit down. No wheels in this bed. Thanks. - You're French. - Mm-mmm. - I am Italian. - Oh. I went swimming in Italy once. - Yes? Where? - A beach. Place called Anzio. - Oh. - It's a long way from Italy. - It's a small worid. - Okay. Here's to... friendship. Long and sweet. Ahh. What's the matter? Don't you like giris? Sure I like giris. Always wished I had a kid sister. Wearing pigtails down to here. Giggling behind her hand and throwing sparks out of her eyes. You were somebody's kid sister once. And look at me now. You look nice. Nice face... nice eyes  Nice. - You look like chipped glass. - Do I? Yeah, like right now. Took me a long time to get that way. Seagulls. They fly over all the time. They make me dream of drowning. Why? How do you feel inside when you look like glass? I feel fine. - I'm sorry I took a cut at you. - Don't touch me! Why did I do that? Well. Hey. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, Riley. Hiya, Fig. Who you rookin' today? If that's funny, why ain't I laughin'? Look, you see that truck? It's been in front of my place all night. Why don't you ask the guy to move it? See, now there's a great head for you. See how fast he figured it out? Bright. You find him and I'll ask him. Say, that's the same truck. The kid with the apples. Well, will you get it out of there? I can't do no business. - I've got to talk to you. - Get in there. Get behind. - Listen. - What can I do for you, cutie? You told me to get the guy off the street, and I did. You didn't tell me he was hurt. Oh, he's hurt, eh? Hey, that's too bad. Oh, you didn't know, did you? Take him out of my room. He's in my bed. Well, it's your bed, honey. Here's your 50 bucks. What you do with him is your business. - You've got to get him out of my room! - What's on the lady's mind? The lady says there's a gentleman in her bed. Will you kindly show the lady to the street? - You heard the man. - You've got to get him out. - I'm losin' my patience! - I'll get into trouble! - You heard the man. He's losin' his patience. - Hey, not that way. Go on. - Hey, Fig! - Yeah? You can't get this thing out of here. Look at that flat. How do you like this guy? Get a tow truck and pull him out. Tow truck? Ten tons on a chopped-up tire? - Say, that baby's loaded. - Well, then I'll unload it. Now, now, slow down, Fig. Another five minutes ain't gonna hurt you. Gimme a chance to find the kid. Everything happens to me. The whole street, he's gotta break down in front of my place. - Tough luck. - I'm the original Tough Luck Kid. - Unload him? - What else? - Hey, how about the law? - Charles. Explain. Is the vehicle parked in front of our joint? - Yeah. - Has it been parked there a long time? - Yeah. - Is it obstructing our place of business? - Yeah! - Well? - We unload. - Come on! We'll sell this stuff on consignment. I'll give the kid a fair shake. If that's against the law, I guess I'm a crook. Yeah! Hey, Gino, Alberto! Come on! Hey, Mario! You want a good deal? - With you? When hair grows here. - Mario! Apples! - Apples? - Golden Delish. - How much? - For you, six and a half a box. Fig, you big crook. But I take 10. Okay. Charles, take order. Mario, 10 boxes. Hey, Midge, Midge. You want apples? You got 'em! - Where'd you steal 'em? - Oh, they dropped from heaven. How many at six and a half? - Twenty. - Twenty boxes, Midge. Charles, take Midge's order. Twenty boxes. Hey, Julio. Julio! Bring truck. The crook's got apples. Hey. Get up. Hey. Oh, let me sleep, Ma. Ed!

Just a little blood. - I thought you were going to die. - Haven't got time. Well, for your neck I have a Band-Aid and "ee-o-deen." Why, it isn't right, "ee-o-deen"? Is right, "ee-o-deen." You better let me wash it off first. Ohh! - How did it happen? - How did what happen? - Your neck! - Oh, that. I cut myself shaving. - Oh. - Hey, do you like apples? Everybody likes apples, except doctors. You know what it takes to get an apple so you can sink your beautiful teeth in it? You gotta stuff rags up tailpipes, farmers gotta get gypped... you jack up trucks with the back of your neck... universals conk out  I don't know what are you talking about. But I have a new respect for apples. Cold water. Makes me feel like a new man. Oh, my. Sit down. - What's so funny? - I don't know your name. - Nick Garcos. - Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. - How does it look? - Beautiful. - You know, you're okay. - Me, too? Yeah, you, too. Going out of your way to give me your bed  Someday I'll be sleepy, and you'll give me your bed. - You fixed my neck. - Someday, maybe you'll buy me "ee-o-deen." - Is right, "ee-o-deen"? - Is right. - Soft hands. - Sharp nails. - You like to make tough, huh? - I am tough. Mm. Is that your truck with the apples? Is it? Is it? The one that looks like an army truck? If they're your apples, Figlia's stealing them. He's selling them from the truck. All right, take it easy! Take it easy. One at a time. What do you want? How come first Golden Delish you got? How come biggest nose in the market you got? - Hey, hello, buster. - What are ya doin'? - We're movin' 'em. - How much you getting a box? - Uh, three and a half. - You're so bashful, Figlia. Go ahead, tell him what you're getting. - He's getting six and a half. - Oh, that's nice. Thanks. Listen, your rig was in the way. Couldn't move it without unloading 'em. - I'm selling 'em for you, ain't I? - I said thanks. That's good. We got 40 boxes left. They go in no time. - 600 at six and a half bucks a box? - Hey. Hey. Where did you get that six and a half stuff? That's what you're selling them for, isn't it? Or is she wrong? - She's not wrong. - Six and a half is right. I oughta know. I'm shelling out. Come on. We can work this out up in the office. What's the matter with working it out here? 600 at six and a half bucks a box makes 3,900 even. I talk business in my office. Thanks. - He'll eat that kid alive. - I'll take odds on the kid. - Sit down. - I ain't stayin' long. 3,900 bucks. I like you. Hey. Let's say you just rolled into town with a truckload of apples. Old Havana. Now what do you think would have been a fair price? - Six and a half bucks a box. - Six and a half is what I got. - I'm talkin' about your end. - Your end of nothing is nothing. You're a tough kid, huh? Okay. Okay, we'll split. Three and a quarter for you  - Six fifty for me. - Hey, listen, you cheap peddler. I was in this business when you were still suckin' a bottle. Probably got that load for a buck, buck and a half a box. I'm givin' you more money than you ever seen in your life. When did you ever make more than a day's pay? You're getting red in the face, Mr. Figlia. Aah. Terrible, the way I lose my temper, huh? - I like you. - I don't like you. - 3,900 bucks. - Hey, you sound like a busted record. Look, Mr. Figlia. You don't know me, but I know you. - You tried to take me. - Who said I tried to take you? - Who said it? - Never mind. Hey, wait a minute. I got it. That, uh  Rica, that trick that picked you up? Hey, the joke's on me. I tell ya, if there's one thing Mike Figlia appreciates, it's a joke. Okay, I'll admit it. I wanted your apples. You didn't want to sell. I paid that Rica a hundred bucks to get you off the street. So she tells you. Hey. Ask me why she tells ya. Huh? Right this minute, she's plannin' how to roll you for all your dough. I don't mind being rolled by her, but from you I don't like it. - Gimme my money. - Oh, what's the use? Gimme my money. I ain't got that much cash. I'll take what cash you got. Write me a check for the rest. How do you know I won't stop it? I don't think you will. - What's the name? - Nick Garcos. My old man's Yanko Garcos. - You remember him. - Can't say that I do. He left a load of tomatoes on consignment with you about four months ago. - I sell a lot of tomatoes. - This load you remember. My old man said you never paid him for it. And if he wasn't hurt, he'd come back and squeeze it out of ya. Oh, that guy. He ran around here squealin' like a stuck pig. It's our own fault we let cheap peddlers like you on the street. Whoop! Check ain't signed. Would you mind pickin' that up? Terrible, the way I lose my temper. Hey! Hey! I mean it. I like you. 3,400 dollar check. Five hundred bucks in cash. Hey, that's quite a killing. Take good care of it. Don't lose it. Take good care of your health. If we had some clams, we could have some steamed clams. That is, if you like steamed clams. I wonder if that thing makes coffee at the same time. How much further you think he can push that jalopy? You mean by day or by night? By night, he'd probably go a quarter of a mile. With a good strong tail wind. I can't understand it. We got plenty of speed, plenty of truck. Why, we'd be glad to take his load in. Wouldn't we? Yeah, we would. Only now, it'll cost him half of what he makes and, uh... a little bit more. Oh, that's awful. The longer he waits, the more the inflation? Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Hello, Polly? Hey, fellas, hold it down, will ya? It's long distance. Calling Fresno. Thanks. - Hello, Polly? - Quiet, fellas! The guy wants to talk to Polly! Can you hear me, Polly? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, well, get your bags packed. Nicky did great. He made a killing the first time up. Oh, Nicky, I'm so happy for you. Daddy, it's Nick. He did wonderful in San Francisco. Yes? How wonderful? Oh, excuse me, Nick. I was talkin' to Daddy I know what he wants to know. Tell him, but tell it to him easy. - 4,000 bucks. - 4,000 bucks. She'll come. - Of course I'll come. - I want you here right away. We're gonna be married today. I don't know. Ask your old man when then next train leaves. Tell her to fly! This is the 20th century. It's faster! Polly, why don't you fly? It's faster. She can catch a plane for Frisco, be here in two hours. Yeah, you catch a plane to Frisco, you get here in  Huh? No. Here. Get off at Oakland, you catch the ferry and I'll meet you at the ferry building here. Nicky Do you love me? What? Yeah  Of course I do. - Bacigalupi, you love me? - Antonio, you are my life! I give you a kiss. I'll meet you in the ferry building downstairs at 10:00. If a guy named Ed comes in, he'll ask for me. Tell him to wait. I'll be right back. Hey! Where you going? - Home, to bed. - Bed my eye! - I wanna take you out, buy you a drink. - Why? I wouldn't have gotten six and a half a box if it wasn't for you. - I just wanted to get you out of my room. - Take it easy. I told you I wanna buy you a drink. A little while ago you were falling asleep and now you're like a jitterbug. If you made 3,900 bucks on your first deal, you'd jitter, too. Come on! Hey, what's that face doing down there? Come on. Smile. This is a good luck day. Hey, hot it up! Hot it up! Let's have some jive. - Haven't you got anything better than that? - What would you like? - Have you got "Apple Blossom Time"? - No. - "In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree"? - No. "Ida, Sweet as Apple Cider"? - What'll ya have to drink? - Apple cider. - Where'd you dig him? - Whiskey, Shorty. We drink to luck. - Good for him, bad for me. - Whiskey you'll get. What do you mean bad for you? - Don't you know? - No, I don't. I thought you were going to be my boyfriend. To your bride. Tell me, does she have pigtails down to here? You know, Italian, American, a cat's a cat. Do you mind if I don't discuss my girl with you? That's right. In such company, who can you talk about? Me. I never had pigtails. See. Let her have them. Money That's what I want. Lots of money. Scusa. I have to say Polly's name again. Polly and I have one thing in common. She loves money, too. - I don't wanna talk about it. - Ah, stupido, she marries you for your money. Give him the bill. He likes to pay. I am sorry. I shouldn't have said that about Polly. - I'm sure she adores you. - I wanna tell you something. Nobody could pay her to pick me up. Keep walkin'. I'd pick you up anytime for free. You know that, lover. Come on. I'll take you home. I often walk here. I like those noises. You don't care about the noises. You walk here because... - in a spot like this, you can be yourself. - What am I? You're not the dame who was handing me that stuff at Shorty's. - You're just a scared kid. - Oh, no  You hang around crummy joints, you stay up all night, you know a slug named Figlia  Who do you think you're fighting? You're only taking it out on yourself. What's breaking you up? What's so funny? Oh, isn't that sweet? He wants to save me. Go ahead, lover. Tell me what a bad girl I am. I'm lost unless you save me. - I don't care. I'll never see you again after tonight. - That's right. Never again. Kiss me good-bye. Good-bye, lover. Nick! Frenchy, you're a beaut. - It was in this pocket. I know it. - The girl. She got it. Rica. Rica! Oh, Nick. I looked everywhere for you. Oh, what they did to you  - Give me my money. - Nick! Before you lie, I saw you pick up my wallet. Yes, I did! I did so Mitch and Frenchy wouldn't get it. Give me my money or I'll kill you. It's true. I took the money. But they caught me and took it away. Figlia. They did it for him. They work for him. - Figlia. - Oh, no, no, amore. The way you are, you can do nothing. Wait till your friend comes. - Ed. He'll help you. - Ed. Oh. Well, that's it. Listen to him now. Sounds like he's dragging cans up that hill. What keeps that crate together? Get up. Get up. I think he can. I think he can! - I knew he would. - Well, I'll be  He's sure steppin' on it now. He's goin' 55. He's climbin' right up. Hey! His drive shaft's busted. That guy's got no brakes! He'll get killed! Pete, watch it! - You are Polly Faber? - Yes? I am Rica. Nick asked me to meet you. - How nice. - How do you do? We go through the market. It's only a minute out of the way. Nick and I are looking for a friend. Come, please. - If you don't mind my asking, what's Nick doing in your room? - He's resting. - I hope he's comfortable. - Hmm? - I hope he's  - Oh, yes. He's comfortable. I hope I'm not intruding. I'm beginning to wonder what I came here for. I thought it was to get married. I ain't got no time. Make up your mind, will ya? - You paid Nick three bucks. What's the matter with us? - I like his personality. Besides, he got here first. Hey, Joe. Leave 'em on the truck. Hey, what do you want? The market's practically closed. You want two bucks? - Okay. Take 'em off. - Three hundred bucks. - By the way, where's Nick? - I don't know. He picked up with some dame. He don't know what happened. He'll die when he finds out. Yeah, it's too bad. A fella tries to make a buck, and that's all. Poor guy breaks his heart to bring us some apples. I'll never forget him. There's the guy - Nothin'. - Yeah, that's a shame. - You say his apples weren't burned, huh? - Not a scratch. Crime they're going to waste. - Well, that's how it is  - Hey. - Yeah? - Skip it. What's on your mind? What'll you pay if I bring in those apples? - Oh, I wouldn't want you  - You said yourself they're wastin'. They can't do him any good laying out there. Maybe you're right. Give you a half a buck a box. What are you two guys talking about? - 300 bucks more, that's what. - What are ya, a couple of grave robbers? Ah, quit your crying. Let's get 'em. They'll only lay out there and rot. - Pete, you seen that guy burn. - Yeah, maybe he's right. Nah, you ain't foolin' me either, Figlia. You want those apples. That's what you're tellin' him. - Standin' there like HonestJohn. - Listen, you, Slob  And you know what? There's the guy to go get 'em for ya. Gimme my share. If you ever see me again, you better be on the other side of the street, because I'll  - Look, you want 'em? - Why not? Okay, I'll get 'em. How do you know he won't run out on ya with the apples? Hey, lock up! Unload fast. We're going with him. I told you Nick was fine, but he isn't. - He was robbed last night. They beat him up. - What? They hurt him badly. But he's much better today. Hey What do you mean, "robbed"? Yes, it's good you came. He needs you. They stole all his money. - Nick. Nick. - Hmm? Hello, baby. Hello, Nicky. You two want to be alone. Help yourself. I take a shower. - Why did you pick her? - She picked me. It's a pleasant surprise finding you in her room. Where did you want me to be, in the gutter with my head busted open? - She took care of me. - Why You are hurt. What on earth happened? I had a little trouble. But I'm all right. Poor darling. I'll take care of you. Oh, Nick, aren't you excited? I can feel my heart pound. Where are we going to stay? I'd like to stay at the Mark. We'll have to wait three days though. It takes that long to get a license. I quit my job. Walked in and told old Bentley, "Bent, you old stick in the mud " Well, you should have seen his face. Darling  We'll, uh, have to be careful with our money. Didn't Rica tell you anything? Why, no. Is there anything to tell? Oh, Nick. I'm so proud of you. You did it. I thought you couldn't, but you did it. - Polly, there's something I ought to tell you. - Yes? Anything wrong? Well, I, uh  Polly, I  It's hard for you, is that it? For one thing, your partner, Ed, walked out on you. For another, you made $4000 like you said, but somebody beat you up and took it. And, of course, we can't get married. I don't suppose you have enough money to send me home. Or to feed me even. You see, I'm hungry... but I'd rather go hungry one morning than for the rest of my life. Aren't women wonderful? The only difference between you and Polly, she's strictly an amateur. She uses a club, you use a knife. - How well you know me. - You said it, sister. You picked me up so Figlia could swipe my load. - And you were so hard to get. - He gave you 100 bucks. - He did? - Did he or didn't he? No, he didn't. He only gave me... 50. And that walk. Where you like the noises. - That was to set me up for Mitch and Frenchy. - Of course. Sure. - Well, was it or wasn't it? - Whatever you say, lover. Any way you want it. Mitch and Frenchy. Where do they live? Where do they live? New Bay Hotel. But don't go there. To them, life is very cheap. Go to the police. Aren't you afraid if I go to the police? Go to the police. I can't figure you out. One minute, you're  What do you want from me? I want for you not to be hurt. Nick, go to the police. Frenchy and Mitch, they have ways. They can kill so it can look like an accident. They will follow you all the way when you drive home. And if you get tired and want to sleep a little... they will push your brake and make your truck roll back and to crash. What did you say? Yes, believe me. They have done this before for Figlia. When he doesn't want to pay money he owes. I know. Nick! They will kill you! They will kill you in your truck! Nick! Figlia! Figlia! - Hey, Figlia! - Hey, hey. Open up! Hey. Even if you kick that door down, he still won't be in. How do you know? What are you doing here? We crossed you up, Nick. We sold to Figlia, too. - Where is he? You know where he is? - Yeah. Well, where? Where? - He's out earnin' an honest buck. - Come on. Tell me! Will ya take it easy. I am telling ya. What was your partner's name? - Ed. Ed Kinney. - That's him. - Figlia and Pete went out to pick up his load. - Did Ed come in? - No, he didn't come in. - Did he send word he broke down? He broke down all right, but he didn't send any word. What do you mean? What do you mean? I'm trying to tell ya. He cracked up at Altamont. His truck went off the road and burned. What happened to Ed? He burned, too. Nick, Nick. Why didn't I tail him? It wouldn't have happened. Don't murder yourself, kid. We was right in back of him. There was nothing nobody could do. - What do you mean Figlia went out to pick up his load? - That's what he's doin'. Figlia's paying Pete four bits a box to take them apples off the road. Why didn't you go along? Don't you want your cut? Four bits a box. Four bits a box. - Four bits a box! - Nick, Nick, now, Nick - Nick, take it easy. - Four bits a box! They'll rook you in the grave!

All right, all right. Shove over, kid. I'll drive. Hello? Hello? Give me the police. Quickly! Quickly! Okay, set 'em up, Frank. Hey, come on in. Take that booth. Sit down.

Suddenly I don't like the company. I'm leaving. He paid me six and a half. Suddenly, I like the party. I'm beginnin' to laugh. You got no right to get rough, Pete. You agreed to it. A deal's a deal. That's right. You got your money, so shut up. You got paid in cash. What I got is a lot of smoke. Sure, Pete. There's always a guy like Figlia to take you. But you You're the kinda guy who plays both sides. You'll always be taken. Listen, cocky boy, you got your money. At least 10 witnesses know you got it. That's right. I gotta shut up. Pete's gotta shut up. How 'bout Ed? How about Ed? Four bits a box. How about Ed? You're crazy. You busted my hand. Does my pop have to shut up? You cut off both his legs. Put your hand on the table.
