You know the keyboard with type writes are like to crying... - 'Slow. Keep it down.' - Oh, yeah? Here we go! Dammit. Hold him still! My bad, sorry l'm trying. - Shit, shit, shit. - What? lt got stuck. Oh, l got this. - What happen? - She got stuck. based on a true story - l don't give a fuck of that bitch. - She freaked out? Yeah. ls there anything more bored than patterns on hotel room? l know. Why they can't just use solid colors? Easier to hide the stains. That's so right. We gotta get the fuck off the stain. Who you waiting for?. Hello, Mike. Can you turn off that goddamn music? Yeah, for most part, yeah. Yeah, l guess you can say that. So it's bullshit they fired a guy because of falsifying his resume... lt because he exposed the work orders. lt's a little late to change your tactic, isn't it? lt's all warp out on the repairs. But it didn't matter because they never gonna do the repairs to begin with. Hey, lad, shut the fuck up! - Hey! - Mike, where are you? Just hanging out with some friends. You know what? You get some sleep, l got this, okay?. - Hey! - Bye. Hi. - You still sleeping?. - Yes. So you try to tell the juror the reason my client was fired.. . Was because his falsify his resume. Not because he went bob your head... And reported the trucks not getting fixed, and people are dying as result. Correct? Say yes. - Yes. - Now, you also already said... That you won't even re-review my client resume... After he went to the media, correct? - Yeah. - On, May 9th... Trucks went to the house Alex Foreman for the broken water pump. That's result on Mr. Foreman burning to death... On June 1 7th... Another house went to the house Crystal Dorgan... Also with the non-working pump also ending with Ms. Dorgan burning... - To death. - ls that true? - lt is. - Not shit? - Damn. - He knew sent non- working fire trucks on the house on fire? - He says he didn't. - But you just say the trucks were broken. .. Because the work orders were deleted. Work order could be anything. lt could be broken ladder... lt could be tire alignment. lt could be a tear on the fire suit fabric. But it wasn't a tear on the fucking suit fabric. The damn pumps won't work, right? So if the work orders were being deleted... And you didn't know the trucks need to be fix... They were never gonna be repair to begin with, were they?. So... l'm sorry, after you realize the paper works system.. . For the work orders were so screw up... That you accidentally approved actually have... Working water pumps. Realizing this, by the way, because my client... Expose the fire department bureaucratic mess to the public.

You thought the first thing you should do... What looking for my client job application and resume... Even though he already been working for the department... For 4 years. - That maybe what it looks like. .. - l'm sorry, sir. To simple question, which is you look into first? The work order system that just cause death 2 innocent people? Or 4 year old job application of an employee... That just publicly humiliated you? And l remind you, sir, that you're under oath. l guess the application was first. No further question, Your Honor.

St. Anthony's Memorial Hospital used it for 2 years. - How's that working out? - Not a single needle stick accident in 2 years. So there's no way you can get stuck with this thing?. Can't get stuck with it. Can't re-use it. Doctors love it. Nurses were begging for it. Only St. Anthony's Memorial would buy it. Why?. l hope you guys can tell me that.

Mr. Weiss, i used to work for Thompson Needles Manufactures. then go fuck yourself. i was a friend of Vicky's. she asked to come talk to you. thought it might be helpful. you got a car?. yeah. follow me. up here. you see, up until the 1960.. needles syringes are made of glass. which hospitals sterelized with heat. Thompson Needle Manufacture refuse to switch to plastic needles, despite the money they make. because plastic needles can't be sterelized. founder of the company, James Thompson, he was quoted as saying.. ''we'll switch to plastic needles, over my dead body''. sure enough, in 1966.. the year he died, Thompson Manufactures switched to plastic needle. within 10 years, Hepatitis C, and AlDS were on the map. they knew that they'd be responsible for spreading epidemic around the world... this tape.. has footage taken by peace corps worker in Nigeria. look, see those kids? children.. they get paid pennies, to bring used needles and syringes to local pharmacies. clinics save unhealth-care by reusing needles at 200 times. this is what's going on, everywhere. Thompson Needles Manufactures they're not only NOT acting on this, they're actually suppressing the knowledge of it. the plastic syringe is the root that AlDS epidemic all accross Africa. and Russia, and lndia.. -sorry, they made an offer to buy Safety Point. we're advising our client to take it. oh Come on Mike! you know if they buy it, they're not gonna use it. that needle can saves more than nurses here. . it can saves millions of lives around the world. i'm just a personal injury lawyer. not exactly the best place to go around saving people's lives. you know something, Mike? sometimes the brightest light.. comes from the darkest places. get it. before it wakes the baby. hello. Jesus Christ, Mike. you'll wake the baby. i'll hang up now, alright? we could talk about it tomorrow. okay, sorry. i like people who are nuts. keep things interesting. do you know anything about the original glass needle manufactures? or anything about plastic syringes? you know, Michael. everyone goes to law schools, to become the good guy. fight the good fight, for justice. is that what you did? yes i did. -how's that working out? do you remember the big.. tobacco lawsuits? -of course. front of congress and on camera. and every states in the union sued them, right? -right. do you remember what happen after that? -yeah. they showed out a 165 billion dollars settlement, that's what happened. no, nothing happened. cigarettes are everywhere. new teenager starts smoking everyday. billions of people smoking worldwide. millions of people dying, every year. nothing happened. big tobacco got a spanking. slap on the wrist. and they went right back to business as usual. i assume you came here tonight to try and.. convince me to do the right thing. i look in your eyes, and.. like oh my God, you're right! then what? guys like me are like cafetaria trays, take one of the top, there's another one right underneath it. i'll bet you spent your whole life, claiming that you.. you were born to do something great. make a difference, do something special. important. well, Michael.. this is most ordinary thought anybody ever had. i'll see you in court. that might be difficult, since your client and partner already accepted the offer. you right. you might have settled with them, but you haven't settled with me. i'm gonna travel the country and making every hospital worker who's ever been infected every mother that lost a child, every child that lost a parent, i'm gonna put them on the stand. and i'm gonna tell them that your client has a needle that could have prevented it from but keeps it locked up. cause it's cost too much to make. trust me. you're about to see just how ordinary i can be. good morning. -good morning to you. what is this? that is a bonus. for the hard work you've been doing. are you serious? -i am. thank you. -you're welcome. listen, there is a long rambling message on the machine from Mike. figures. here he is now. you're up early. yes? you the partner?. -yeah. died in his sleep. so, this is your partner?. Michael Weiss? yeah. he died alone? detectives will be able to answer some of those questions. they wanna talk to you bout something. have you seen these needles before? it's a safety needle. can't be reuse. that explain why there's so many of them. are you okay, Mr. Dancort? could we offer you something to drink, tea perhaps? no, it's alright. Mr. Danziger. sorry to hear about Mr. Weiss. we offer our most sincere condolences. so, since we're all here we should probably hey boy.. hello Nat. it's been a long time. you and me.. we're going to court on this one. looking forward to it.
