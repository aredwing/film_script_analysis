(Yelling in pain) And you've been turning your back on me When on trial I'll say your name Can you hear While I'm begging for justice in vain I'll be near I'll be here, waiting I'll be here, waiting I'll be here, waiting Guilty Tyrant Lunatic Torturer In the name of God I'm nobody's son Victim Monster Judas Cain Call me like you want I'm my own father I'm my own father (Child speaking) (Woman speaking) (Dance music playing) (Shouting) (Laughing) Hi, uh, I'm sorry for my friends. They're... Haven't I seen you before? Oh, yeah, I'm Sofia. Thank you. Um, the beauty contest, two years, ago, remember? You won, right? No, I didn't. I only made the finals. Really? With your face and smile, You should have won the damn contest. Excuse me, another glass. So... how come you came back? Work, as usual. Are you shooting a movie in Bacau? No, it's a TV thing. Oh, what's it about? Uh, it's a reality show, And we're looking for an Eastern European girl... Thank you. Who can speak a bit of Italian. Oh, well... I do. I never get a chance to practice, but... I do. Well, here's a chance. You stick with me tonight, and you can practice. Or... You can come with me to Rome, and speak Italian all day long. Okay. What if I take a picture of you, And show it to the producers? You never know. Sure. Why not? Smile. Excuse me a second. GIRLFRIEND: Sofi! GPS: In two kilometers, you will reach your destination. Thank god for that thing. Well, Rome is so big. You can get lost even on foot. Big enough to make all my dreams come true. (Phone beeping) Check this out. Who's perfect? You are. The producers liked your photo. If you want to come with me, I'll organize the audition. But I can't just leave everything. When are you coming back? I don't know. In a few months, maybe. All right, look, let's do it like this. Give me your book and I'll take it to the producers. You have a book, don't you? Of course, wait a second. Never had a book, but I'm sure you know a photographer in Rome. All right. Today, I recall Some years ago My hands were too strong To let them go The dreams I had chosen to live When I was 17 And all that I've seen through my eyes I won't let it go No No My mother twisted fate She was the first to blur away Her curly hairdo The rouge upon her mouth I asked her, smiling, "Do you love me?" And father Twisted fate I stare in his eyes now Every day By day it's a bit cozier. I'm sorry for a little discomfort. No, it's okay. It's not important. But... Are we sharing the same room? I'm not that kind of producer. I'll be sleeping in another room. Good night, Sofia. Good night. Hey, here you are. Who are you? Sorry, where is Gabriel? Where is Gabriel... Do you understand me? Okay. Gabriel! Gabri... Stop! No, no, no! Relax. Hi. Who are you? Don't worry about him. He works for me. You're a very pretty girl. You look better than your pictures, actually. What pictures? Who are you? Where is Gabriel? Gabriel owes me a lot of money. And you're the one who's gonna pay me back. With your job. No, it's not true... No, it's... Get yourself dressed. No, no, no. There's a mistake, it... You shut up! No! This is your job. This is your fucking job, okay? I'll tell you what... I'd give ya... the count of three... If you don't get dressed, he's gonna help you. All right? One... Two... No, no, no... Three. No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! No, no! (Fabric ripping) No! No! No! No! No! Stop! How much? Get in. Didn't Fabian explain the rules to you?

For them, we're just merchandise. Just shut up. You don't know anything. Anything! How much? Get in. (Unzipping) Put this on... for me. Please go. Go. To the police. Take me to the police. What the hell? What are you doing? Do you understand me? I said take me to the police. Come on. Come on, take me there. Come on. Please. Sorry, I can't. No, no, no, please. I can't. No, no, no, you have to take me there. I'm married, okay? No, no, no, don't worry. I won't say anything. No, please, no! No, please! No! Go out! Help! (Yelling) You are in big trouble! Stop! Leave her alone. Shut up! She was screaming and crying. She got out of the car and ran away. She run away because the guy didn't want to use a condom. No, that's bullshit. I'm sure it is. Where did that mark come from, anyway? Who did that? I told you, not the face. Not the face. Why don't you show her her back? Look at the fucking mark on her back. Look at that. What do you think of that? You know what that is? That's my mark. That happens when people misbehave. 'Cause everybody around here needs to understand Who the boss is. Right? Let's see... Eeny meeny miny Moe. You know how she got that? Pull up her sleeve. All right, now, you can cut yourself, Just like that. 'Cause you're young, you can learn these things. Okay? I'll give you a chance. 'Cause it was your first time. If you can't do it... Well, then Fabian here, He's gonna fuck you up the ass. Understand? Here you go. No! No, no, no, no! What you did was very serious, all right? It's a disappointment. You're an investment for me. You became risky. I don't need a risky investment. You understand? Aaahh! (Screaming in pain) You can call the police if you want, All right, but they're not gonna believe you. In fact, even if they did, By the time they start an investigation, I'll be gone. I'll be long gone! You know where I'll be? I'll be at the school, looking for your little brother. And I'll get him, and I'll cut his throat, And I'll drop him in a fucking dumpster. All right? Aaahh! You owe me 30,000 euros! You understand that?! You work it off. And then you can do this. You can fly away like a little birdy. Hi. Hi. Nice. So... Let's go for a ride? No. Why not? Come on. Let's go for a ride. Come on, let's go. No. Why not? No. Not you. Go home. Come on. Let me go. Come on... What's wrong with you? Are you crazy or what? Come on. You don't wanna come with us? You look so beautiful. Stop it. Let's go, let's go. Fuck off. What did you say to me, bitch? She said fuck off. What the fuck you want? I'm worried about the safety of people around here. You should step five or six kilometers back. Whose safety? Yours. (Laughing) My safety? You know, man, I can pay. But see, first you pay, then you touch. You touched and didn't pay. That's not good. Fabian! Bring the jack. The fuck is this? What do you think you're doing with this fucking jack? Oh, well, it's for you. It's for me? Yeah. You fell down the stairs. Say it! I fell down the... stairs... The stairs. I fell down the... (Shouting angrily) (Car engine starting) My heart. Okay, I take 30... No, let me out. I can't. You take 30, right? I will triple that. Okay. Okay, listen, we can't go too far. Find a spot nearby and stop. That's the rule. I pay. I say where we go. Okay. What would you like? Shut up. Come closer. That's enough. Your shoulder. Higher. Are you okay? Shut the fuck up. (Car horn honking) Where the fuck did you go? You know you're supposed to stay in the area. Where'd you go? Hey, look... Take it. It's more. Hey. Listen, I... I never thanked you for the other day. How old are you? 17? You can tell you're still a kid. If you weren't a kid, You would've kept the extra 60 euros, Instead of forking it over to that shithead. How do you feel? Me? All right, I guess. Listen, I wanted to ask you... The money you gave me, what do you do with it? I mean, we're always here. Hey. Think you can keep an old goat like me company? The car? I have a camper, here in the lot. We take a short walk. Okay, with me. You have 40 euros? Are you kidding? Of course I have 40 euros. What about you? Are you coming? Come on, she's too expensive for you. Three is more fun. How much you gonna cost me? With three? 200? Yeah. Come in. Come in. My place. Pay now. Here. Here. All right, just leave it to us. I'll make myself comfortable, yes? All right. You like it, yes? Oh, yes. So sexy. Oh! Ooh! Oh, yes. You like it, yes? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Mmm. So sexy. (Grunting) Argh! Argh! (Girls laughing) How did you figure him out? Didn't you how he would never look you in the face? His eyes always down, like a trouble dog. Men are easy. They are mostly worried about their size. You always tell them, "My god, it's huge." What if it's not? Well, then, tell them it's big. And if that's not possible, You tell them they really know how to use it well. This is for Manol, this is for me, And this is for you. Okay... Let's go! Help me, please! (Laughing) Looks like no sleep today. How much have you set aside? A bit. A lot of clients ask to do it without a rubber. They pay more. Aren't you afraid of catching something? Yes. But I want to get out of here, so... But how? I've got about 10,000 euros. I'm looking for a client who will go and help me escape In exchange for that money. What if it takes the money and just disappears? Or what if it tells Manol? He will kill you! Wouldn't it be better to give the money directly to Manol For your freedom? See what a baby you are? Why? What did I say? If I give him the money, he will know I took it from the client, And he will kill me all the same. I need to find someone who will go to Manol and buy me. I can't wait so long. Sofi, I'm pregnant. Are you a soldier? No. Then how come in the photos... I was. No more questions. Get undressed. Put it on the floor. Look we need to hurry, Because I have to go back as quickly as possible. 300 euros. One hour. Get on the bed. (Heavy breathing) Don't. Hug me. Rock me. Will I see you again? Maybe. (Car horn honking) I told you, I was in a hotel... with a client. Which hotel was that? It was... it was the Providence. Providence. Yeah, the Providence. That's a nice place. I have something I want to show you. Little movie. Watch that. Not my brother, please. No, no, please. Please, no. Not him. Gimme that phone. Come on. Pavel. Yeah, everything's okay. Yeah. You can go home now. I know. I'm sorry. I know it. I just want to pay the 30,000 euros and so I can... Leave... please. 30,000 euros? 30% interest... Is, uh... 39. 39. 39,000. Now, food and clothing and gasoline, And all that stuff. You know... (Chuckling) I have a feeling that you're gonna be working for me For a really, really long time. Whoa... (Laughing) (Whimpering) (Tires screeching) (Crying) I... I... What the fuck are you doing here? You lazy bitch! What the fuck are you staring at, huh? (Grunting in pain) Fuck. I'm sorry for all that crying, before. Thank you. They are threatening my brother, And so I can't... I can't do anything, I... Look, I need 30,000 euros to buy my freedom, And I thought maybe you could lend me... I can give you... And why I should I help you? Because you're... Good hearted, and... Because you can. Okay. Open it, read it, and then fold it. This is the deal. You make me say what's on the paper... And your boss gets the money. You have five minutes. What should I do? I was no sergeant. I was a contractor. Everything in this house, The money I pay you, Comes from torturing a lot of people. Come on. Hit me for fuck's sake! Imagine I'm that son of a bitch who sold you. Will you give me the money? Two minutes. (Man yelling in pain) What's written there? If... If I die, I will not talk. (Yelling) No, no, please! What's written there?! Oh! Answer me! Please! Hey, are you there? Hey... Everything okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? Aah! What's written there? What's written there?! (Speaking in foreign language) (Man speaking in foreign language) (Repeating word in foreign language) What does it mean? It's Somalian. (Screaming inaudibly) It means "mercy". You blew it. There goes your freedom. Hi. I'm Hector. Sofia. Okay, what do you wanna do? Oh, no, nothing. I just wanna talk. Yeah, sure. No, really... Listen, do you wanna fuck or what? I... I can't. (Speaking Romanian) Please, wait, wait, wait. I'll pay you. I'll give you the money. I just wanna help. No, I don't need any help. Sofia... you don't understand. I am a priest. Shit... I belong to an association That's trying to fight the prostitution rackets. Do you know what that means? It means that we know that someone has been exploiting you, And they've been holding you like a slave. I want you to tell me their names, And where I can find them. And then we will set you free. I promise you. We can help. No, you can't. But maybe... there is someone you can help. Good. But tell me everything. Sofia. I'll be in touch with you very soon. Thank you. Come on! Hey! Ho, ho, ho! Get over there. The fuck over there. Hey. Listen, uh... my good friend, I'd like you to meet him. All right? Hector! The man of a thousand faces. A thousand joys and sorrows. He's seen me through thick and thin. Most trusted, all right? Say hello. This is Alina. Bella, Alina. (Speaking in foreign language) This one, however, no introduction is necessary. No... Sofia. Sofia was quite shy when I first met her. And then, suddenly, as if she was bathed In the baptismal waters, she started confessing. She confessed quite a bit about... About everyone, didn't you, Sofia? MANOL: I can only imagine. These things seem to happen. Over there. Are you hungry? Please. Yes? Actually, no. You deserve the most. Scusa. Considering your condition, right? Come on. Look what else I found. See? You don't hide things from me. It's not right. You're more expensive than I thought. You're getting more expensive every day. Did you know that Frank Sinatra used to roll up his money Just like that? I need it. For the abortion. (Vacuum whirring) No, no, no. Stop it! It's too much! Stop it, please! Please! Fabian. That's okay. Stop it. I grew up Catholic. We do not believe in abortion. I think the life starts as soon as the sperm enters the egg. It's growing. We should honor that life. It's a gift from god. Go. Go see your friend. You'll take care of this baby? No one's going to hurt this child, I promise. But will you take care of it? Good. Come. Do you have any idea How much a healthy baby is worth on the black market? (Laughing) Go. Ai-yi-yi... I mean, we're talking about a lot of money. How much is it? 300,000. Maybe even 400. It's gonna be okay, believe me. The last one we shot was skanky whores, disgusting pigs. Heroin addicts with one tooth in their head. I love them all, trust me. This time the client, they want classy. So let's give them classy. This is the duke. He handles all my logistics. Flash. He takes care of treatment and disposal. And this... this is Thomas. The great professor. He handles all my affairs when I'm away. You going someplace? I gotta go up north and handle some business. Don't worry about it. You're in good hands, With professore. Come. Let's sort your business. All right, we're all set. We got the actors. Everything's nice. All we need is a director. How come we don't have a director. Ah, we had one, but there was a little controversy. Little problem, so... we had to let him go. (Laughing) I mean, like, let him go. I know just the guy. I'll give him a call. Beautiful. Listen... maybe they are keeping us here, Because they want to sell us to another boss. It can happen. Okay, when? Tomorrow. Tomorrow afternoon. No. No, no, no. Now. Let's get it done. Okay. Let's get it done. Okay. (Speaking in foreign language) Hey, did you order the pizza? Yeah. All right, well go keep an eye for it, will ya? Goddamn thing. (Laughing) Watch it, you didn't see it coming over here. Boom! If he has a left-handed girlfriend, he's fucked. (Laughing) (Muffled screaming) Shh! Quiet! Or they'll kill us all. Who are you? They want to kill you, so I'll get you out of here. What the fuck is going... (Grunting) Grab something. We have to get out of here. Now! They wanna kill you in a snuff film, Sofia. Snuff. You know what that is? Manol called me to film your death. Tortured and killed, and then they'll sell on the market. I was supposed to be the director. Why?! Why did you sell me?! Because I got a rope around my neck! I lost 80,000 euros at poker with Manol, And I couldn't pay up. He was blackmailing me. He said he'd get revenge on my whole family. But now it's finished. I don't want to be anybody's slave. Look, I got your passports back. There is a plane leaving tomorrow at 7:00. Tomorrow morning, we are in Bucharest. We'll get your brother, my mother, and my sister Before those bastards can arrive. And we'll go away, Sofia. We'll go away. A friend of mine has a house near that airport. We'll hide there tonight. And tomorrow, at dawn, we'll take off. I hate you. Who is this friend? An Italian movie director... Who knows about my troubles. He's out of town now. And won't be back until tomorrow evening. We'll be leaving from here in seven hours. So you better rest a little. Solider. 100 if you tell me where Sofia is. Excuse me? Where is Sofia? I don't know. Who does? Ali. Ali. I'm sorry. That son of a bitch, Hector, tricked me. I just wanted to help you. I didn't want to... Thank you. Where is Sofia? I asked you a question. Where is Sofia? She's not here. Then where is she? You will never see Sofia again. Okay. (Gunshot) (Groaning in pain) You bitch! Shit. Damn you. Damn! Ali, wake up, Ali. We have to go. What's the matter? The door was blocked. You locked us in. I didn't lock you in. It's the door. Look. You should pull it harder. You see? And what's that light? There in the mirror. You see? Oh, yes. Gabriel. Gabriel! What the hell have you done? You evil bastard. I didn't make you come with me, Sofia. Give him the money. (Speaking foreign language) Hey, whoa! Finish the job. That job to finish, right there. For the last time, talk. You have no idea what I've been through in my life. You think a woman can make me talk? (Electric buzzing) (Chuckling) (Yelling in pain) Where is she? Where is she?! Aahh! Where is she?! Done. Why... did you free us? To make the film more realistic. It's one of the golden rules of cinema. Before inevitable doom, There must always be a scene of hope. In this game, the rule is: "do it to her". Simply pronounce these magic words, And the other has no choice but to sacrifice herself Instead of the one who was chosen. And the big prize is really simple. She who makes it till dawn, will go back home. Twenty lashes. Will you take them, or do we start on our little mom's back? Aah! Aahh! Everyone talks in the end. In honor of our financier, A respectable Turkish businessman, Our next tool is a typical affliction of that country. The falaka. This hurts more than on the back. 20 stripes. Do we give them to you, or your friend? Me. Stop! (Whipping) (Screaming) Please! Aah! TORTURER: Come on! Go on, say it. No, no, I did not understand you. No... No... Did you say "do it to her"? No! Do it to her... (Chuckling) (Moaning in pain) I need to change the battery. I'm gonna go outside for a while. I'm gonna go get a drink. All the time with those stupid masks. What the fuck are they doing? Almost done. (Unzipping) What do you expect? For them to show their faces...? Since you are so fond of each other, For your last admission, we will allow you... A sweet kiss. A special kiss. With this. One of you will go back home... And forget this ever happened. The other... will die. That's a good girl. Kiss your friend. Put the gun on the floor. Kick it away. GABRIEL: Please, I need help. Take me... to a hospital. You can't go to a hospital, you asshole. They'll call the cops. Later, I'll take you to a vet friend of mine. Now just shut the fuck up. But... I said shut up! I'll be finished here in ten minutes. Now you're gonna pay, huh? I'm sorry. I would've done anything to save you. MANOL: Smoking kills, huh? I'm getting sick of this shit. I gotta get out of this business, basically. It's no fun anymore. I need my money. Give me my jacket! Go on, kiss your friend. You have a minute. If no one swallows, both of you will die. (Spluttering) (Coughing) I said that the survivor would be allowed to go back home, But I'm afraid I was lying. MANOL: Can you imagine? Just give me... My jacket... my money... Now we... First, an old score has to be settled. My jacket... (Groaning) (Moaning) Today... you're gonna die. So are you. (Gunshot) Okay... You gonna kill me? Is that it? Go ahead. Okay. I don't give a shit, all right? (Laughing) Thank you. Today, I recall Some years ago My hands were too strong To let them go The dreams I had chosen to live When I was 17 And all that I've seen through my eyes I won't let it go No No My mother twisted fate She was the first to blur away Her curly hairdo The rouge upon her mouth I asked her, smiling, "Do you love me?" And father Twisted fate I stare in his eyes now Every day He's dark and grave But he speaks a lot right now He tells the words I've always wanted Brothers All the crowds, all the lights All the joy, all the fights And all the times we waved goodbye All the love, all the hate All the miles that we ate The Earth looked like a big balloon The time we played on the moon The woman that I love She whispered in my ear Yesterday The blackest eyes And that Mona Lisa smile The scariest dream was to survive her All the crowds, all the lights All the joy, all the fights And all the times we waved goodbye All the love, all the hate All the miles that we ate The Earth looked like a big balloon The time we played on the moon Now I'm old enough To leave this town And half of my memories Are shaking me right now I close my eyes, breathe out And feel my Charger '69 I close my eyes, breathe out And kiss my life goodbye
