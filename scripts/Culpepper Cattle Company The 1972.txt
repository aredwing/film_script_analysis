Teach you to mess with the Ben Mockridge Express. I'm gonna get you next time, Ben. Goddamn birds. I tell you, Ben, if I don't ever see another chicken again... as long as I live, it'll be too soon. - I've been making plans. - Yeah? Like what? You'll see. - I finally got it. - Yeah? Where? - It's in the wagon. - Let me see. - Maybe I will. - Ben, did you bring the laundry? Uh, here it is, Mr. Slater. Tell your ma we'll pay her next week. That is unless you want to trade for a couple of chickens. No thanks, Mr. Slater. My ma says we could wait. Go get the laundry, Tim. Hey. You're gonna show it to me. - How much? - Four dollars. Yeah? Let's see. That looks like a nice one. I wish I had one. If my pa caught me with one, he'd give me hell. - Does your ma know you got it? - No. - You've been practicing, huh? - Yeah. Can you do it? Can you- Can you really do it? - Of course I can. - Let me see. Told ya I've been making plans. Yeah, but ain't you still delivering laundry for your ma? Not for long. It so happens that Frank Culpepper's... gonna be driving 2,000 head... to Ft. Lewis, Colorado. - I plan to go with him. - Yeah? He signed you on? Not yet. Oh, hell, I bet you ain't even asked him. I'm waiting for the right time. - Yeah, when's that gonna be? Three days after he's gone? - I just told ya. I'm- Tim! Unload those crates! Goddamn chickens! What you doing creating so much dust around here? Excuse me. Could you tell me where I might find Mr. Frank Culpepper? Thanks. Hyah! - All right. Coming in. - Get that big one. - Come on. Bring in another one. Keep that rope tight. Stoke up that fire, boy. Aaah! Sorry. Mr. Culpepper? Mr. Culpepper is right over here. Uh, Mr. Culpepper? Mr. Culpepper? - Mr. Culpepper. - What is it, boy? Can I talk to you for a minute, Mr. Culpepper? That's what you're doing, ain't it? I wanna go with you, Mr. Culpepper. I ride real good, and I can do a lot of things. I mean, I'll work at almost anything, Mr. Culpepper. - Oh, I really want to go. - Why? 'Cause I wanna be a cowboy... more than anything, Mr. Culpepper. Well, that's one hell of an ambition, boy. I work hard. I work real hard. All right. See the cook and... tell him you're gonna be his Little Mary. Thanks, Mr. Culpepper. I'm Ben Mockridge. Mr. Culpepper told me to see you. - He did? - Yes, sir. - What for? - He told me to tell you- Well- He told me to tell you- I'm Little Mary. I got the money, Ma, from the Newsomes. Uh, Mrs. Burns paid me, too. And, uh, Mr. Slater said he'd pay next week. Mom... I talked to Mr. Frank Culpepper today. They're leaving in the morning, pointing them north. I asked him if I could go along. He hired me, Mom. Bye, Ben. - Bye, Mom. - Be a good boy now. Yee-haw! Yee-haw! I've never been up north before. Wait 'til we get to the desert. Sand scorching your eyeballs. Driving through country that ain't fit for scavengers. Dry enough to make you drink your own piss. Sit downwind, son. You really got the itch, ain't ya? Well, I do. I guess all I want to do... is punch cows and ride and... well, just cowboying. - There's nothing better than that. - Like hell there ain't. - That's all I want. - Kid, cowboying is something you do... when you can't do nothing else. Hayden, you old belly cheater. Damn, what a day. Finished skinning them birds yet? - This here's the last one. - Did you gut him? - No. - Hell, what are you waiting for? How do you know what to put in there? I don't. How do you make that look so good? Print, you and Wallop take the early watch. Burgess and Old John, you take the next. - When's your turn, Frank? - Not me. I'm the king on this one, mister. King don't do nothing but sit on his ass. The way the Good Lord intended. Hey, Little Mary... picket up my horse for me. Uh, yes, sir. Pete. Good God! I just told that kid to take the horse... over to the picket line. I didn't say to ride him. I'm telling you, that kid's as green as grass. Hey, I had a girl back home once. Lily of the valley. Yeah, she was real pretty. Uh-huh. Pretty goddamn ugly... and pretty likely to stay that way. No, I was gonna marry her. You'd fall in love with a stump broke mule. Oh, you sons of bitches can go to hell. She's probably like one of them girls... you was telling us about, in that saloon. Oh, yeah. You should have been with me, Print. That was some place. Oh, a place like any other saloon. Only it had this here glass ceiling. Bunch of Parisian girls living up on it. - How many of them was there? - Sixteen, 17 of them. - Naked as jaybirds. - Damn! That's right. Every now and then, one of them kinda hunkered down on all fours... and licked the glass with her tongue. Goddamn! I'm telling you. I was sitting down there looking up at 'em. Well, how come, uh, with all the naked Parisian gals up there... the glass didn't break? Small. Little tiny girls. Only stood about that high. Well, that's the truth. I gotta get out to the herd. I got enough of this for one night. Stampede! Stampede! Stampede, boys! Get mounted! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Don't get- Don't get too close to 'em! Get 'em milling! Mill 'em around! I can count 20 strays... but there's 200 more in a box canyon... - about three miles- - Good, Pete. An old man's got 'em, and he's holding 'em. - Did you talk to him? - Yeah. He said, "Come and get 'em." How many's there? - Like I said, about 200 head. - I mean men. Oh, the old man's the only one I saw. Hmm. Burgess, Wallop, stay here with Marco. The rest of you boys, come go with me. Does that mean me, too? You got ears, ain't you? In there. The old man was standing right there before. Well, he ain't there now. Print. Cook. Ramon, arriba. Rutter, come with me. Pete. Stay here and hold their horses, kid. Sure glad to see you, mister. Been waiting for hours. Your cattle, huh? They sure do run. And by the time we found these here... they was plumb run out. You're mighty lucky we come upon 'em... the way they was a-wondering. I appreciate it. The way I see it... generosity deserves its own reward. Say... fifty cents a head? Rounds out nice and even that way, don't it? I don't think I'm that generous. You sure disappoint me, mister. And what's more, you disappoint these boys back here... after they worked so hard... and they're plumb cultus... just as mean as they come. So do you wanna search your soul? Suppose I don't. Then you ain't gonna get your cows. Well, in that case, I guess we have no choice. Move. Hey, boy. Come over here. Yes, sir, Mr. Culpepper. Now we're just about right here. I want you to ride due south... until you come across this little river. Shouldn't take you more than three or four hours. You listening? Yes, sir. Due south. And then head west right into the sun. Over here is Castigo. No more than an easy day's ride. You got it? Yes, sir. Castigo. I'll find it, Mr. Culpepper. Go into the cantina, and you ask for Russ Caldwell. Russ Caldwell. You tell him I've lost four men, and I need him. Two or three others as good as him if he can find them. A dollar a day and found. You got that? Yes, sir. I'll tell him. A dollar a day and found. Then get to goin'. Now, I'm counting on you, boy. Thank you, Mr. Culpepper. Good-bye... Cook. Damn kid. He ain't never gonna find his way back here. Eh? What did he say? Oh, he wants to bet you can't hold your hand on that jar... and keep it there when that snake strikes. Yellow bastard! Afraid of a snake! - Excuse me, but I'm looking for Mr. Russ Caldwell. Thank you. Mr. Russ Caldwell? Huh? You're looking at him. Mr. Frank Culpepper- Now cut that out! What do you want, boy? Go on. Say it. Mr. Frank Culpepper lost four men. He need's you and two or three others as good as you. Dollar a day and found. I can lead you back to where they are. Don't stand behind me, kid. Well? You walk here? I-I lost my horse. There was only two of them. Trappers. They took my gun, too... and Mr. Culpepper's horse. Howdy. Shit. Get your stuff, kid. He was moving. Well, shit. That's my gun. Let him have 'em. Frank. This is Luke, Dixie Brick, and this here's Missoula. - They're all good men. - Glad you brought 'em. Uh, listen, Frank... we're gonna have to make more than a dollar a day. Then you rode all the way out here for nothing. Don't turn you back on me, mister. Don't let your mouth overload your hardware, cowboy. Things have been tough, Frank... and they're getting harder all the time. It's no fault of mine. Dollar a day. - Which one? - Which one? Which one have I been talking about all this time? No, there's no question, Wallop. That woman was playing tunes. You're getting worse all the time. You ain't gonna find anything like that in a small town. - Small town, hell. - I was in St. Louis one time. I went to this sporting house... and damn if there wasn't a little girl in there who had three tits. - Say what? - Three tits. One, two, three. Count 'em. Each one of them just as ripe and rosy as the other. Now, boys, I'll bear witness... that was a sight to behold. What was her name? Her name? Rosie. Rosie McCormack. You heard of her? No... but I heard of Hank McCormack. They say he could shoot the flame off a candle... at 50 feet. Not only that, on the next shot, he'd fire it up again. Is that a fact? Old man Fuller... well, that's someone I know back home... he said he saw his trigger finger once... in this big glass jar over in Leffertsville. Said it was the meanest looking trigger finger he ever saw. Mean and bony. Boy, you don't watch out... you gonna grow up to be a worse liar than I am. - Hey. You're rubbing off on that kid. - Shit. You call this found? Nobody said you had to eat it. I told you once before. Don't stand behind me, kid! How come they keep calling me Little Mary? That's your name, kid. What's the matter? Don't you like it? No, I don't. It's a girl's name. Well... that's what they call a cook's helper. Little Mary. Christ, I wish you was a girl. Sure is a nice horse. What's his name? You don't have to put a name... on something you might have to eat. How are they? They're tired, Frank. They won't run tonight. I'll remember you said that. Missoula, Wallop, you got the first round. Russ, Dixie Brick, you got the next. Mr. Culpepper, I'll go on night watch. - Forget it. - I can do it. Really. I'm not tired or anything. Hell, let the kid take my place. I'll tell you what, kid, you can- You can ride for me, too. Well... how do you know the kid's any good? You gotta sing to them cows. I haven't heard that kid let out with... one single, solitary note. You know, that's a fact. You know, if you don't sing to them cows just right... they'll just wander off. So come on. Why don't you sing us a song? Come on, sing. Come on! Sing! I'm not sure how the rest goes. That's enough. Get your horse. Hell, boy. You're gonna shoot your damn foot off. Who-Who's there? Don't get excited, kid. Just me. Wallop. Oh, yeah. I thought it was you. You got any tobacco? No, I don't. Figures. It's all yours, kid. Who's there? You better come out here right now. Now you just stand right there. I mean hold it. Hell, boy. You don't wanna shoot me. Why'd you wanna do that? Get back. Put your hands up. Listen, boy. I just wanna talk to you. I wasn't tryin' to steal those horses. I was just- Oh, hell. Yeah, you-you know what I was doin'. - Yeah. I was just- - Get back. All right. All right. Okay. I'm- I'm gonna tell you. I'm gonna tell you just exactly what I was doin'. Whew. Mighty nice horse. What- Frank, the remuda's gone. Roll out, boys! Make it fast. The horses are gone! - What is it? - How the hell should I know? - Easy, kid. - What the hell happened to you? M-Mr. Culpepper, I- - They jumped me. - Who jumped you? - They beat me up. - Who? I was riding along... and I saw there was some guy by the horses... and- I didn't know how many there were, and, uh- Go on. Go on. Well, there was a one-eyed man and he started to talk to me. Talkin' to you? What the hell do you mean? He was talking to you? - Yeah, just talkin' to me. - Well, why the hell didn't you shoot him? - I wanted to, Mr. Culpepper. I swear to God I wanted to. - But you didn't. Well, I'm sorry, I- Damn stupid kid. I should've known better. Sorry. I'm sorry. Let's get him back up. Easy. Missoula, go in there... and find out where we can get us some horses. While you're in there... get the kid a ticket on the next stage. Where to? I don't give a damn as long as we get rid of him. Hey, ask if there's a doc in town. Frank, how about a drink? Let's get rid of the kid first. Doctor's around back. No stage till tomorrow night, and he doesn't know nothin' about no horses. Keep a watch on the horses. Come now here, son. What happened? Well, you're young. You'll mend fast. You ready for that drink now, Frank? Yep. Come on, kid. Okay, drop in and go on through there, friends. Wait. Give us a bottle. That'll be two dollars a bottle. Maybe we're not gonna drink the whole bottle. That don't make me no never mind. It's still two dollars a bottle. It might not be worth two dollars. - There's only one way you're gonna find out. - Come on. Okay. I'll call you. Hey, how about some glasses here? There's only one way you can find out. You gonna call or ain't you? Say, friend, a town like this... there ought to be a lot of horses. There's enough. Why? Could be we're interested. Huh. You-You don't look like no stock buyers to me. What do stock buyers look like, mister? - Hmm? - Come on. He ain't gonna give you the damn card. He never could shuffle anyway. - Let me finish shufflin'. - Huh? - Well, you're takin' all day. - All right, you shuffle, goddamn it. Leave me alone, you son of a bitch. - It's him. - Who? The one-eyed man who stole the horses. What do you want to do now? - Put your ante up. - You'd better be sure, boy. - I'm sure. - Bartender. You want something, mister? Cover him, kid. Take it easy. If he moves, kill him. We're looking for some horses. I understand you got a lot of 'em. Well, here's a man who wants to buy some horses. I didn't say that. Well, then, uh... what did you say, friend? - Three cards. - I said I'm looking for some horses. I was just watching the game, mister. Maybe it's best you just tell me where they are. We ain't got no horses. - Yeah, you do. - Who says? The kid. The one you stomped last night. I didn't stomp any kid. We ain't got no horses. Where are the horses? - I don't know nothin' about no- - The horses! I'm not gonna ask you again, mister. Listen, I- I didn't have any part in this. I- I don't know anything. I want to go home. I want to go home. L- I was just watching. Just watching. I swear it. Shit! Ah. For a reformed man, I could've sworn... you looked like you was enjoying that. Please. This one's still breathing. Get up. - Can you hear me? - Get me a doc. Please. We will. But first, you tell me where you put those horses. - A gully just outside of town. - Which way? It's about a mile east. Where the road forks. - You believe him? - Yeah. - Is he dead? - Deader 'n hell, kid. Deader 'n hell. Come on, kid. Let's get the horses. Will you guys hold it down out there? You're gonna get dust in your grub! Thought you were gonna get rid of the kid. Sure as hell ain't worth it. You just like to travel. Best part is gettin' into town... or gettin' out of town. In-between is lousy. The same with women. Goddamn you, kid. I told you to stay out of my way. What the hell is goin' on here? - Ah, this crazy son of a bitch slugged the kid. - He took my gun. I was just lookin' at it, Mr. Culpepper, honest. I didn't mean- - Shut up. - Nobody calls me a son of a bitch. That's right. The gun was lying on the blanket. The kid just picked it up. That ain't no reason to slug anybody. You want to try to do something about it? You gonna do anything about this, Frank? - No business of mine. - Frank? It's just you and me. It was my fault. I shouldn't have picked it up. Go on, beat it, kid. It's your move. Mr. Culpepper, this ain't right. I don't want no fight. I ain't done nothin'. I ain't no damn gunslinger. Why, I don't want no trouble. You called me a son of a bitch. Nobody calls me a son of a bitch. Nobody. I take it back. I take it back. No. I'm waiting. Well, ain't anybody gonna do anything? - I'm still waiting. - Well, to hell with it. You son of a bitch, you. I told you I was gonna do that, didn't I? Nobody calls you a son of a bitch, huh, Russ? Well, I wasn't talking about you, Frank. 'Cause you're a rotten son of a bitch. You give me any more trouble, I'll blow your damn head off. You understand? - I said, understand? - Yeah! Mr. Culpepper, I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean nothin'. You just cost me a good man, boy. So from now on, you better make yourself real small. Damned if I wouldn't rather be robbing banks. Yeah. Sure as hell hope they got one in Fort Lewis. We just might do that. There's water, right over the hill. - Let 'em go! - Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Come on, move 'em up! Get around there, Ben! Hyah! Hyah! We're going into town to try to find out... who owns this land... - before we get our heads shot off. - Yeah. While we're gone, take a couple of the boys and try to get that fence back up. Yes, Mr. Culpepper. You do look awfully pretty. Get your horse and you follow 'em. I-I need supplies. Now, I need two sacks of flour... a sack of beans, big bag of Arbuckles... and potatoes and onions, if they got 'em. All right, I'll remember that. Well, tell it back to me anyway. Two sacks of flour, a sack of beans... a big bag of Arbuckles. Taters and onions, too, if they got 'em. Smart-alecky kid. Should be home with your ma. - Uh, whiskey all around? - Just pour it. You gentlemen just passing through, or... y-you plan on stayin' for a while? Who owns that piece of grazing land just west of here, by the river? Uh, that'd be, M-Mr. Thorton Pierce. Thorton Pierce? Yeah. He owns practically everything around here. Got some business. I'd like to talk with him. H-Hector. Y-You run and find Mr. Pierce, do you hear? We'll have another. Yes, sir. Pour. While you gentlemen are waitin'... I got something you might enjoy... passing the time with. Such as? Out in that back room there... is a n-nice little lady. Genuine... f-former virgin. I p- I paid $60 for her in Santa Fe... just last month. - How old is she? - How much? I- I'll tell you what- Uh, let's see, there's, uh, there's... six of you... I'll make it f-four dollars for the lot... and- and you can chip away all you want. And what about the kid? Think he ought to go half price? Tell you what... four dollars, and I'll throw in the whiskey. That sounds good. What do you think, Russ? I think we should take a look at her. Come on, Dixie. Come on, Dixie. You really pay $60 for that? I-It's the honest truth, mister. Well, shit, you sure got took. Hey, Russ? Why don't we let the kid go first? Yeah. Go on. Go on. Go on. - Come on, kid, go get in there. - You get it while it's hot. Ma'am. Oh, Lord. Kid! Well, what's this I hear... about somebody wants to talk business with me? You Mr. Pierce? Frank Culpepper. Those your cattle sittin' on my land? Yep. We're drivin' 'em to Colorado. I don't care where you're drivin' 'em. Right now they're drinkin' my water... and eatin' my grass. That's why we rode in, to make an arrangement. You should've thought of that before you drove... your pretty little cows onto my property. - We'll pay a fair price. - You will? Well, that'll be up to me to decide. I sell my grazing rights for 30 cents a head per day! I'll tell you what, $200. We'll be out of there tomorrow night. The way I figure it, you owe me $200 right up to now. And the price, why, it keeps goin' up all the time. - Like hell. - Keep out of this. We'll move 'em out- today. Uh-uh. First off I gotta have my damages... for trespassing. The 200 will do for a start. No, it sure as hell won't. You ain't got no choice, mister. Mr. Culpepper? So first off you... just drop your gun belts on the floor. 'Cause all I gotta do is spit. Now drop 'em. All of you! Nice and polite, ain't ya? $200, my friend. All right, pick up your feet and get moving. Get out! Now get your horses and walk 'em out of town! Scat, boy! And you, too, Texas. I don't stay generous for long. Ain't no egg-suckin' son of a bitch... ever take my gun before. Ain't you gonna do nothin'? We're going back to move the cattle out. Frank. Frank. Ain't nobody gonna take my gun. What the hell's the matter with you, Frank? You heard me! We're taking the cows to Fort Lewis. Mr. Culpepper, what about the supplies? Forget it! - Ain't nobody ever done that to me. - Shut up. You want a chaw? Um, no, thanks. Hey, boy. Hey, Little Mary. - Yeah? - Is it true what they're saying? About what? About them three pretty girls you seen in town. Was there really three of em there? Yeah, that's right. Three of em. - A dark'un, a redhead, and a blonde? - That's right. Is it really true that that blonde's from Paris? Paris, France? That's right. Sure wish I'd been there. Which one did you have, boy? I had 'em all. Had 'em all? I sure wish I'd been there. Water and grass. - How far? - Three miles. - Anyone there? - Settlers. They said we're welcome to it. There's water up ahead! Keep 'em moving! Hyah! Hyah! Easy! Easy! Hyah! Let 'em drink and then bed 'em down. I'm Frank Culpepper. I want to thank you people for your kindness. You're welcome here, my friend. I'm brother Nathaniel Greene. This here's brother Ephraim. Brother, huh? We're all brothers and sisters here. All children of God. We've been following the path that God set for us. It's been a long and difficult journey. We passed through the wilderness at last. And he's led us here. This valley's our Canaan. Here we shall build, and all will be welcome. Amen. Well, I never would've figured anything like that. Would you? Shit. I feel naked as hell without my goddamn gun. Boy, I'll tell ya... some things more important to a man than cattle. Here in this valley, we shall live in peace and love. We shall live without fear and without greed. Here we shall build a refuge for the weary and the sick... and the outcast... and we shall ask no help... but we shall offer it to all. Each shall give what he can... and each shall receive what he needs. This land will be the land of innocence... and here a man can live without violence, without bloodshed. I promise you as God has promised me that this shall be. Easy, boys! Well, now, Texas, you're still on my land. That means you're still trespassing. It could cost you plenty. Seems to me like you got an awful lot of land. You got a deed to it? These are all the deeds I need. You got one hour to get off. Start movin' and don't stop. You'll reach the salt flats by nightfall, and you're welcome to 'em. If you've got any other ideas, just remember... that last time I took your money... and I took your guns and that was pretty easy. This time I may have to take all of your cattle, and that could even be easier. - It won't be. - Then I'm giving you one hour... to get your cattle off my land... or I'm tellin' ya, Texas, I'm gonna take 'em all! I'm gonna take everything you got! One hour. That's all the time I'm givin' you. And you, too, brother! I warned you before, and I'm warnin' you again! Get off my land! God's land. - My land! - God's land. He brought us here, and here we shall stay. This is his bounty. There is land enough for all. You're a squatter, and around here, we shoot squatters! We come back, ain't nobody better be here... 'cause we're comin' in to blast whatever trespassers is left! Give 'em a taste. God sent you here to help us. Mister, the only place that God is sendin' me... is to Fort Lewis, Colorado. He's givin' me one hell of a hard time getting there. - He'll kill us. - All you have to do is leave. We cannot. - You ain't gonna let him do it again, are ya? - We're movin' out now! Damn it, Frank! I ain't gonna take this anymore! You want to eat that old man's dirt, you go ahead... but don't ask me to swallow it for ya! Ain't nobody askin' you to. I got maybe 12 or 15 days to Fort Lewis... and right now I don't care what I have to do, as long as I get there! Damn! So? Whoa. Come on, kid. Hurry it up. You ready to roll? - Right. - I'm not goin', Mr. Culpepper. I'm sorry. - I'm- I'm stayin'. - What the hell for? Get on that wagon, boy. Quit wastin' time. These people, they need some kind of help. You can't help 'em. Some things are more important to a man than cattle, Mr. Culpepper. Not to me. Roll 'em. - Move 'em out! - Hyah! Give me your rifle and some ammunition. I said, give it to me! Damn stupid kid! Come on, cowboy. Do this right. - Well, shit, come on. - Come here, boy. How long are they gonna keep that up? I don't know, but these people sure are gonna be disappointed. Why? They're expectin' God to come down and help 'em, but all they're gonna get is us. Here they come. Damn! Shit. We're leavin'. We can't stay in this field of death. This entire valley's been soiled with blood. But you said you wanted this land. God never meant for us to stay. He was only testin' us. You're welcome to come with us, if you want to. What about them? You're not just gonna leave 'em there. You've got bury them first. God's will is that we go. I said you've got to bury them!
