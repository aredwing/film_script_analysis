This is about a failure of the three blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. So what can we see here? Bleeding, anemia and some kind of infection. Can anybody tell me what it could be? Paulo. Paulo. Who gave me this name? Excuse me, my dear. Let me take a look at you. Let me see your eyes. Do you bleed when you brush your teeth? Yes, I do. - Do you? - Yes, I do. Lay down, please. Easy. You see petechiae, ecchymosis... It's anemia. Now sit up. Well, professor. It looks like leukemia. You are right. Paulo is inspired today. Well, as for the treatment, Rosalina should start chemotherapy, an aggressive and long treatment, but she still has the option of a bone marrow transplant. Anyone here would like to... I'll be waiting for you at the terrace after class. Alice, maybe you could say something. Rosalina is an old friend of mine. She works with me and has helped me a lot with my children at home. Now I'm trying to help her, right Rosalina? Thanks for helping me with these guys. Thank you. Relax! We will take care of you. - Excuse me. - Yes. I'll be back later. Land, ho! - Across the cross! - Stop it, Paulo. - You're going to fall down. - From clay to clay! Paulo! There is something better here. Come! Help! Come here. Let me go! Help! I'm gonna eat you up! Careful with the cannibal! Are you going to eat me up, you cannibal? Come here. Come here! Ol! - I have some grass. - No, not today. - You can pay me later. - All right. Some of your questions are a bit baffling. You're focusing on the political aspect, the moral aspect. You have to help the interviewees understand themselves as citizens and individuals and express their needs. But the research is really good, Len. It's really good, Rita. For God's sake, no way! Ritinha! - What do you think? - About what? "School and Soccer" by Len Maranho and Ritinha Almendos signed by both of us. No. "School and Soccer" by Len Maranho. I'll have my own ideas published. Wow, you're so vain! You can't work as a team. We are unbeatable together. All right: "School and Soccer" Rita Almendos and Len Maranho. It sounds much nicer. Stop talking nonsense. We're still 70 bucks short for the rent. Give me some money. It's all in here. And in here. I can't believe it! You lost your key and then you lost mine. Damn it! Let me take a look at this. "Anatomy for Artists. " Aren't you a doctor, man? This is a masterpiece. - It looks wonderful. - Wonderful. You don't pay rent, you don't pay the phone bill, you don't pay anything at all. Your money goes to books and this crap you smoke. Stop smoking this shit. It will make you dumb! You know my philosophy: it's forbidden to forbid. So tell the cops, when they catch you with your little box, "It's forbidden to forbid. " So I'm the one who spends all the money. Let's see what's in your backpack. What's this? Cartola! Don't you have his entire CD collection? Beth Carvalho, Jamelo. Samba School! Giddens is your department... Habermas... "A History of Insanity"? This is great! We're even, buddy. This is for you, buddy! - You're joking! - No. There's a dedication. "Idiots of the world, unite!" You son of a gun! - Is it here? - No, over there. We lost our keys. Go ahead! Give me your bag. You lost the keys! I can't believe it! This place is beautiful! Shit! Anybody home? Can I have a roasted chicken, Mr. Manuel? On credit with the rest? The cold water feels really nice. I love the color of the tiles. It goes with the sink, the bidet, the toilet... It's hot around here. It's hot, it's far from the ocean, but it's close to school and it's cheap. Why don't you live with your parents? Because I like to take care of myself. Besides, they live in Braslia. - I'd love to live by myself. - Really? But I don't have the guts. You don't have the guts? Look at where you are! This place is great. Your friend is a Botafogo fan! - Don't you ever fight? - We never have. - You will. - No, we won't. - Yes, you will. - No, we won't. - You will. - No, we won't. I can't believe it! It's so cool out here. Really? Those tiles look like a French movie. I have never noticed that. Your bosom buddy should arrive soon. I don't think so. Flamengo is playing today. - Hold the ladder. - I'm holding it. Kiss. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. I'm supposed to have lunch with my buddy here, in the Architecture building. Len. Your "buddy," right? Why don't we go to my place and study for a while? You could help me with the medical report. There's some beer and plenty of food. I've already eaten enough. Liar. You're always hungry! DON'T THINK ABOUT WHA YOU WILL BE, JUST BE I We're running out of white, I'll go get some more. God! These guys are so stupid! What's up, guys? Give me some attitude! - Aren't you a medical student? - Yes, I am. Here. Sign this petition. You'll be the first. Are you part of the student union? I'm the president. Really? Cool! Maybe you could help us here. Thanks. - Fuck! You idiot! - What happened? Look at this. - Hey, Brother. Jerk! - Jerk! - How's the water? - It's just wonderful. Jump in here with me. I'm not wearing a bathing suit. You can swim on your underwear. I'm not wearing anything. - Then jump in naked. - Naked? No way! What's going on here? This is my bosom buddy. Is this your girlfriend? The one you talked about and wanted to introduce me to? Me? Introduce you to my girlfriend? You came here by yourself! You are keeping her from me. You owe me an explanation. I don't owe you anything. You're not my therapist, my mom, you're nothing! I'm glad I have wax in my ears. What a beautiful mermaid! - With all due respect. - Do I know you, "Ulysses"? I'm Paulo de Almeida Brando, your humble servant. Let's go! - Thank you. - We support the strike and also the privatization issue. See you at 7 p. m. in the Architecture building. Make sure you go! Those fools are wasting their time. Why? Do you support privatization? What difference does it make? With or without my support, they will privatize it anyway. We'll see! "Students united will never... " This is so outdated! Not everyone is alienated like you. Idealists, like you, are all stupid. All governments have the same projects for their people: health, education, jobs, housing... For me salvation is in a pussy and cannabis only. - Write this on my tomb. - When you graduate, if you ever graduate, you'll be a terrible doctor! Your hungry faces made me feel sorry for you. My princess! When was the last time you ate? Who knows... Dr. Paulo. Dr. Len. Delicious! Can you buy me a hot dog too? With onions, tomato sauce, mashed potatoes... - Take it easy! - We can share it. What a moocher! Do you think my dad is a banker? Ah, Patrcia. My name is Letcia. Patrcia, the little rich girl. This retard has a sense of humor. Put the sandwich down! Put it down! Can I have another one? Go! Go! Go! Congratulations, man. Hold on! What? Wait! Her blue eyes were so beautiful, so... deep. What... what did she want to tell me? Maybe she wanted to tell you that drugs are no good. What's your name again? Paulo. Yes, you do look like a Paulo to me. This place here reminds me of my childhood, when I flew a kite and played soccer. Did you use to live here? No. I lived in a place similar to this one. Now my father lives in Braslia, it's different. - And why are you so happy? - Why? Love is beautiful So beautiful Nothing else can be that beautiful NEIGHBORS ASSOCIATION Do you go to school every day? - More or less. - More or less. - What about soccer? - It's just fine! You must go to school, man. And why don't you go to school every day? Because I'm lazy! Do you help your parents at home? Yes, I do. Do you help your mom or your dad? - My mom. - How do you help her? I help her pick up bottles and sell them. Go, Diogo! Go for it! Kick the ball! Go, Diogo! Go! This computer is a piece of shit. The questions are not straightforward, our project lacks purpose. Give me an example. We have no information on the families. But I told you that first I wanted to find out the children's life expectancy. This is not literature. This is reality! If we don't know their family reality, how can we get to know the children? Pay attention. The child depends on the family, right? - Of course! - So the problem isn't the child nor the family, but the context where they live in, and what they get from our country. Without that, our project will turn into a novel. A novel? Little Rita, you say nice things but you only think of politics. Little Len, you speak very smoothly but you are extremely stubborn. You never think of politics! - What? - This is about politics. - I know it is. - Everything is about... Excuse me. I don't think everything is about politics. There is no politics in love, in feelings, in Nature, in art... Listen, Letcia, if I were you, I'd put this sentimentalism, this love thing, aside, even Nature, if you please. But there is politics in art. When you mix art with politics, it is no longer art, because it sells an idea, it becomes commercial. - Can I give my opinion? - No, you can't. - It's forbidden to forbid. - I forbade you to touch my PC. - Let's eat! - All right. Let's go! - Paulo finally had a good idea. - A great idea! - Pasta. - It's the only thing you have here. Are there any onions here? Little Rita from Minas, I know why you are so irked about this research. You must hate soccer. Little Paulo from So Paulo. You are wrong twice. The research is going really well, and my soccer team is Atltico Mineiro. I bet yours is Corinthians. You are completely wrong! I was born to suffer. My team here is Botafogo and, in So Paulo, I'm So Paulo. Paulo! Paulo! Yes, Mariana. What is it, sweetie? Can you help me with Math? I don't understand anything. I can't today. What about tomorrow? All right. - Hi, how are you? - Fine. - Hello, Paulo. - I can help you. - Hi, how are you? - Fine. Mariana, get down. You're disturbing them. No, she isn't. - So I see you tomorrow. - All right. See you. Mom, if I don't a good grade, please, don't complain. This damn chemotherapy! Stop! Right there! It hurts so bad! I hate this treatment! It will go away. I'm dying for a cigarette! There are some in the drawer. Get me one. Are you crazy? If you smoke, you'll feel worse. - You have a fever. - So what? Will it give me lung cancer? What difference does it make at this point? - You shouldn't. - Get it for me! It's in the drawer. Hurry! There are no more cigarettes. And now this! If it weren't for my children, I'd rather be dead. Listen to me. I have some medicine here... No medicine! It's different. You'll feel better. But this is between you and I. If anyone finds out, they'll kick me out. How chic! Come. If only I could go home... What about your children? The younger one, Little Cacau, has a really bad temper! He only does what he wants, but he doesn't get in trouble. He's a very responsible kid. - How old is he? - Thirteen. I can't, I'm working. What about the other one? Cinzio is 22. He's a really good person. But he's always having problems with the police because he's a street vendor. - What does he sell? - Watches, radios, perfume... He treats me like a girlfriend. Don't be snooty! But he's a nice-looking black guy; I saw his photo. When he brought me here, he promised to stop fighting. Did he? Yes, he did. But I'm worried about him, because he hasn't shown up lately. You know how easily kids out on the street get in the trouble. I'd like to hear from my boys. I think about them all the time! Tell me the truth. Am I going to die of this blood problem? Yes or no? Life was never easy for me, but I always managed to get along. I had a job, a home, a samba school. Let me tell you something. Go ahead. I was a flag bearer, can you believe it? Of course I can. - Let me tell you something. - Sure. When I first saw you, I said to myself, "Damn! I missed this hot black girl!" Whenever I go out, I bring Diogo with me because he's already 15. So he helps you with that. Yes, he's the one who helps me. Besides that, he goes to school... Yes, he studies at night because he can't go to day school at his age. So I have to make him do something during the day. Does he play soccer during the day? On the weekends. On Saturdays and Sundays, he plays soccer the whole day long. And besides this job, do you do anything else? I'm a cleaning lady and a laundress at three different places. And do you follow closely his schoolwork? - Yes, I do. I have to. - Why? To make sure he really goes to school. I'm not saying it's useless, but it doesn't solve the problem. This is only a palliative project. The government should create a more consistent project. All right, pretty baby! So we go home, watch TV with our feet up, drinking beer, the government does its job while we do nothing! If I'm pretty or not has nothing to do with it. Don't change the subject! If a drug dealer offers one pair of sneakers, one T-shirt, a couple of bucks, whatever, to any of those kids, they run to him! Not everyone wants to be a thief, not everyone can be a thief, do you know why? - Why? - Not everyone wants to die young. - Do you know why? - Say it! Because there are too many beautiful things in the world. Mr. Z! I'm leaving the money here. - Sometimes you annoy me! - Why? You can see here the 5 principles or modern Architecture: it was built on a piloti, the facade separated from the structure, horizontal windows, free ground plan, the terrace and the garden. This is where Le Corbusier got the idea for his parasols, which are very suitable for our weather... It's so dirty! The streets are filthy, beggars on the streets. It's sad! Don't exaggerate. It's still a wonderful city. They've destroyed everything. Everyone "loves" Rio, but no one takes care of it. Sometimes I feel like going away from here, to a quiet place. Wouldn't you like to? Yes, I would. Who knows? Do you want to get married? What are you talking about? No. We could be roommates, like you and Paulo. - Do you agree? - Yes, I do. The Penha church is so beautiful! - It's gorgeous! - So, what is it going to be? What do you want to watch? Drama, comedy, action, porn? - Have you ever been there? - Yes, I have. I went there to do a work for school. Let's watch this Brazilian movie. Where is it? Let's go there instead of going to the movies. - I've never been there. - Let's go? - Let's go? - Right now. What about the movie? Is this a democracy or what? You're just getting a free ride, so shut up. This place is just beautiful! Let's scare her. Jesus! - How did you get here? - I'm smart! More than the two of you, you idiots! I feel like I'm in the middle of an ocean. What do you mean? An ocean of slums. Look. Land, ho! What do you want to see? The museums, the architecture; Paris must be beautiful! - The cafs, the Frenchmen... - Is that all? And also to practice French. Ah! That's obvious! The little rich girl speaks French. - Say something. - Go to hell! How do you say, "French women are really hot"? "Les franais sont beaux et bien elevs". "Petit con"! It sounds beautiful! What a poetic language! Don't you ever flush the toilet? - How do you say "I love you"? - Go flush the toilet! Say it and I'll do it. "Je t'aime". Hey! Don't you wash your hands either? Are you a sergeant to give me orders? How do you say in French, "French people love to beat up Afghanis, Jews, Africans... "? And how do you say, "Leave my girlfriend alone, moron!" All right! Mengo! Mengo! Go, you bastard! Fuck you! Mengo! Goal! Fuck you! Get this shit out of here! Get your hands off me! Wait! What are you doing out here? Little Paulo, I need to see my children. Calm down. You must get stronger first. I must see my children, then I can leave in peace. Go upstairs, stay here in your hospital room, and I'll go see them. - Do you promise? - I'll do it. Promise me! Do you promise me? Yes, I do. I promise you. Come with me! Help me here. Everything is fine. There's nothing wrong. Being sick is awful! Being a Botafogo fan is worse. It only brings me sorrow. Do you like Tim Maia? I like it too. Why? Nothing. I do. I used to play the piano. Cool. I thought you never studied! Did you? Why? I thought you didn't have time for it. You're always dating someone. - I've never dated anyone. - Liar! Not like you and Len. It's just... sex and that's it? Oh, my God! Don't give me that romance crap. It's not romance crap! Get your feet off here! Get off! Haven't you ever been in love? Ever fallen in love? No. Why? Am I abnormal? I don't know. Everyone falls in love. What time is it? Jesus! I'm late. Can you give me a ride? - Yes. - I'll go change. All right. Where are we? In the heart of the darkness! They've abandoned this place! My aunt raised us all together. She made us go to school every day. Otherwise she would give us a rap on the head. We really miss her. How is she doing? You know how it is, Mrio. Hers is a distressful disease, and the treatment is harsh. But she's very strong. For God's sake! I hope nothing happens to her. Everything is going wrong with us. Cinzio has just died, and the boy is hiding over there. My aunt must survive. With her it's a matter of time. We'll try to keep her as long as we can. I'm worried about her emotions. Cinzio was like a brother to me. He was a good person. We shared our secrets. He was a great guy. He was really angry. The cops took his merchandise and beat him up all the time. - How so? - How so? No, thanks. They took his merchandise and beat him up every day, those damn cops. He rebelled against that and tried to get us together. Are you also a street vendor? Yes, I sell CDs. Guess what the store owners did? They hired lieutenant Aldo to kill Cinzio. So he killed him. Now they want to kill Little Cacau. He saw everything. Give this to my aunt. It was Cinzio's. Let's go. - Mrs. Neide. - Hello! - How are you? - Fine, thanks. I've brought a few friends over to talk to the kid. All right. - How are you? - Hello. Letcia. Little Cacau! Little Cacau! This is Paulo, your mom's friend. He's cool. She sent me here. This is the best place we found to hide him from the police. Mrio told me what they did to your brother. I wish I could kill those bastards. - Fuck that! - Don't talk like that! Get this idea out of your mind! Come here. Let's talk over there. Down. Down. I still think this is a dangerous place. We have to take him somewhere else. Where to? Don't you have any family in another neighborhood ...or another city? - No, we don't. The kid cannot even walk on the street! The police is all over. The owner of the house is a very nice person, but she is scared. I don't know what to do. Look at what they've published. "The drug dealer Cinzio Souza was killed in a confrontation with police. His underage brother, who is also a drug dealer, ran away after a long shooting and is on the run. " Bastards! I'm sorry to barge in, but you need professional help, a lawyer, NGO... Listen! I'd rather die than to be fucked in prison. Shut up, Cacau! You are underage, and I know what will happen to you. I want my mom. We are going to help you. Paulo will help you see your mom. - Right, Paulo? - Of course! Everything will be all right. Write a letter to your mom. It will make her happy. St. George. Yes, to close the body. It's pure illusion. Damn! She's going to die of sadness! You can't tell her anything. I have to say something. Make up a story. Lie! Whatever! I'm getting drunk. What are you going to do? I've told you I don't know! I don't know what I should tell her. Are you stupid? I'm talking about the kid! You have to help that kid! - Help him? - Of course! What can I do? Don't you understand? That kid is going to die! They're going to kill him! - You have to do something! - Me? - Yeah, you! - Me? Why me? What can I do? I have no idea of what to do! Do you? No, I don't know what to do. Don't do that. - Please, don't do that. - Shit, man! - They're gonna kill the kid! - No, they won't. Nothing will happen. Please, Letcia, don't. Listen to me. - We are going to do something. - They will kill him! Listen to me! No, they won't. We are going to help him, OK? We'll do something about it. Was it your hands or your mouth Can you drive, please? Why? I'm not feeling well, I'm a little drunk. Me too. Do you want more? Look at that palace! "Love's House. " Have you ever visited a palace like that? It's half-price for students. Not like this one. But I think we should change the subject. Yes, definitely. - Do you believe in UFO's? - Yes, I do. I hope we are abducted and taken to another planet. - Let's go for a swim. - No way! - Stop being a wussy. - No! - You're no fun! - No, Letcia. You're so pale! Come on! I'm on my underwear. - You're so pale! - I hate the sun! Paulo! Stop it! Paulo! Fuck! Fuck you, man! Now I'll have a thing called scan. Don't worry, it's no big deal. What's wrong with you? It's nothing, Rosinha. Tell me. I've got something to tell you. What is it? Why are you so troubled? It's because of a girl. So you're in love! Maria de Lourdes, please. Is she married? I wish. It's worse than that. She's the girl of someone I know. I understand. Someone you know? Friend or relative? Take a rock salt bath, light a candle and pray. In those moments, only God can help us. Or maybe... Why don't you just do it? - Let's go! - All right. What will you specialize in? I haven't made up my mind yet. Why did you decide to become a doctor? The mystery of death has always fascinated me. What is the sense of living and turning into dust? Are you serious? Of course! Don't you believe in God? No. I do. I'm a Catholic. You believe in anything: in God, in anything I say, even in soap operas. Why are you talking like that? - I'm not OK. - Stop smoking this crap! - It's forbidden to forbid. - Don't give me this nonsense! This is harming you. When you smoke, you become a jerk. Superficial, uninteresting... A perfect idiot. There's something else here harming me. Are you in love with him? - I like him a lot. - Are you in love with him? - It's none of your business! - Are you or not? Damn! It is none of your business! I think this medicine is crap, it's too weak for this treating tuberculosis. It's just too weak. So you are Michael's father. Do you go with him to his games? No, I don't. Has he improved his performance at school since he started playing soccer? No, he's a good student. He comes home from school and does his homework right away. That's the first thing he does. Why are you so quiet today? You were kind of rude. You did not even listen to what people were saying. - You think so? - What's wrong? I don't know. I'm kind of worried. Worried about what? Nothing. Forget it. What's wrong? I don't know. I think... I think I'm very confused. I'm too tired. I want to give up on everything. I compete with my own shadow. Is it because I like Sociology? Or because I'm black and have to prove I'm better? I'm tired of this! You're the best in class, everyone knows that. You're not the best-looking one, but you're very charming. Any girl could notice that. What about you? Let's see what happens, OK? Paulo. Why did you call me here? I... was thinking... about Rosalina; have you spoken to her? I changed the subject. I began to talk nonsense. Aren't we going to do anything? Don't insist! What do you want to do? I don't know what to do. Do you? Do you know what I think? This whole thing is a mess. I just want to give up. At least you have your method for forgetting things. I don't. Why the long faces? We're philosophizing. - Are you hitting on her? - Don't be stupid, Len! You're hurting me, man. - I'll break your face. - Go ahead and do it. Be careful with her, she's not what she seems to be. - Hello, my little princess. - Hi, Len. Your friend said you were here. Well, I'm leaving. Where are you going? To accomplish an impossible mission. I'm going with you. Why are you excluding me? Wake up, wake up you whining black girl Stop being so lazy Who are those two angels? They are our friends. This is Letcia and this is my bosom buddy Len. No. He is my bosom buddy. We brought these for you. - Chocolate! - I have some chocolate here. Pick one. What if I pick the wrong one? You have one chance only. Let's see... You're great! You're the best doctor in town! Are you all happy? - Let's go for a walk. - All right. We'll be right back. A letter from Little Cacau. I feel so sorry for her! No one can help her, no one can help her son. I'm a very lucky person. I have everything. Are you happy now, Rosinha? Things will get better, you'll see. Look. Cinzio sent you this. He filled it with kisses for you. Paulo. You have a good heart. This was his amulet. It's yours. It will close your body. He sent it to you. Don't try to fool me. It's yours. Keep it. Damn life! All right, he will testify. So it's him and the cop before the judge. Who do you think they will believe? The cop! They don't believe us, they don't even care about what we say. I don't believe it! He didn't do anything. Besides there are lots of witnesses, everybody saw it. Witness? What are you talking about? There is no such a thing as a witness here. If you live here and testify, guess what happens to you? You are an informer, a rat. You're finished. They'll burn you up. Mrio. Look at me. Do you think I don't know how things work here, man? First, we are going to get the kid out of here. Trust me. - I'm not going to jail! - You won't go to jail. You are underage. The Law will protect you. The only protection I need is a gun to kill the bastards who killed my brother! You are not a criminal! Forget it! I know, but they want to turn me in. They'll take me to jail! What is your problem? Calm down, Cacau! Relax, Brother. - Calm down! - Hold on, Cacau. Calm down, man! Take it easy! Listen to me! I promised your mom to take care of you. You said that last time and didn't do anything! One step at a time. We are here to help you. - I want to see my mom! - Don't worry. You will see her. Shouldn't we talk to Rosa and let her see the boy? No, first we have to get him out of here. Shit! That's why I don't want kids. I want at least half a dozen. We'll take him to our place, but how do we get him out of here? In Letcia's car. No, let's leave her out of this. I'm going to call my mom and take him to Braslia. - He'll be safe there. - We'll take him together. She'll take better care of him than she took of me. - Damn! - Let's go. Easy! - Name. - Paulo de Almeida Brando. - Name. - Len Alves Maranho. Did you come here for drugs? - No, sir. - No, sir. We came here to do research for school. I want to see your backpacks. ID. ID. - Your name. - Rogrio, and I live here. - Your name. - Nlio Costa. I'm glad you didn't bring your little can with you. Do you think I'm stupid? Stop it, kid! Are you okay? My hot black woman! What is it? I need to talk to you. Say it. Listen. I have something important to do and I'm late. You don't have to say anything, I understand. Let's go! Watch this for me! - Hello, aunt Lu. - How are you? Fine, thanks. - Paulo. - Where is Len? I don't know. He said he would be here and didn't show up. - He had something important... - What? - I don't know! - What? - I don't know! - Damn! He went by himself. LEN, I CAN'T... So, what do you think? You might like Braslia. You could go back to school, and become a senator, or maybe even a president. Don't forget me! Can you imagine this guy a president? - A black president! - Imagine that! Awesome! The taxi is here. Let's go! Slow down. Slow down. Let me see your ID. - What's going on in there? - Nothing. Fuck! It's the kid! - Get out! - What's going on? Get out of the car! I told you to get out! - Come on! - Move! Really slowly! - Go! Over there! - Go! Listen. You've never been here. Go! - Get in. - Go! Ahead. Move! Up there! Move! Turn around. Right there. Away from each other. ID. Let me see your ID, you little rascal. - I don't have one. - Give me everything. Leave us alone. We won't say a word. I swear to God! We can explain. I was doing research. Research my ass! You're screwed! My father works in Braslia. If you do anything, you're screwed! - Shut up! - You're screwed! - I'm sorry. - Do you see? I have nothing against you. My business was with your brother. Don't do that! For God's sake! Don't do that! Stop it! - You son of a bitch. - Damn, Cacau. Don't do it! - Shit! - Freeze! Where the hell is he? You can't hide! I'll get you! Over there! What happened? Do you want me to call anyone? Oh, my God! Be careful! Help me here! Turn him around! How did you find him? Where was he? Some guy called me and told me to pick him up! He doesn't know what happened! Jesus Christ! This jerk went by himself! By himself! What am I going to do? He has to go to the hospital! He needs blood! He needs to undergo surgery! He said it was the police who did this! Haven't you learned anything in Medical School? He's burning with fever. Place a cold water compress on his forehead. If he bleeds again, hold it tight with a clean towel until it stops. Don't touch him. Give me your car keys. I'll go to the hospital. I need light here. Closer. I need light! I'm sorry. I think I can feel it here. It's close to the surface. His backpack is gone with his wallet and documents. I don't understand. I'd like to ask you something. - Please, go home. - No! I'm not going! It will be safer. If we need you, we'll call you. I'm not going! I carried him here in my arms! If he were conscious, he would ask you the same. But I'm not going! I saw him shot! I'm not going to leave you two here by yourselves. Hello. Is it the bakery? Can I speak to Mrio? It's a friend of his. Yes. Didn't he leave a message? All right. No, it's OK. I'll call him back later. Thank you. There is nothing here. Water. Water. I'm going to bring you an ice cold beer. How could you go by yourself? You should have waited for me. - I could have done something. - Like what? There was nothing anyone could do. I remember those bastards' faces as in a nightmare. The looked at us, as if we were nothing, some garbage, whatever! Cacau... Cacau was strong. He fought with one of them. But I was a coward. I just ran! I remember the look in Cacau's eyes. There was no fear! There was just hatred! Those bastards will come after me. I know they will. And I will kill them! Take it easy! When you get better, we'll solve this. Don't fool yourself. Everything is rotten! We pretend to be blind because we don't want to see it. What are you doing here? Why did you let her stay here? We are going to denounce everything. We are going to screw those bastards. Don't be stupid, man! Paulo, where is Len? He's disappeared. He had to go to Braslia take care of some family problems. Braslia? Len wasn't going to Braslia at the end of the term. Well, it's his life, not mine. Listen, Paulo. There's a guy looking for him, he has all his papers. He's a cop for sure. He wants your address. - Did you give him our address? - No. - What is going on? - There's nothing going on. - I know there is. - Don't get involved, Rita. - What? - It's nothing serious. - He is my friend! - This is a hospital. Keep your voice down. Stay out of this. - So tell me! - Damn you! Something really serious has happened to Len, but he's all right. I can't tell you. You will find out eventually. - Let me help you. - Do you want to help? So don't say a word to anyone. Forget the whole thing. All right? I must go back to class. I have an exam. Forget it. Call me, Paulo. If you need anything, call me. - Get out of my way! - What do you want? Do you want me to tie you down? - Get out of my way! - You're not going out! - Get your hands off me! - Don't do this. - Get out of my way! - Watch your arm. - Get your hands... - I'll hit you! Get your hands off me. I'm getting out of here! Let go of me! For God's sake! You only think of yourself. What will happen to Letcia? - She won't be with me! - What will they do to her? And what will it happen to me? Do you think I'll leave you alone? Damn you, Paulo! Damn it! I should have grabbed my things and left. Let me see the wound... if it's open. Thank you very much. God bless you! Shit! Shit! Let's go! Come! Stop at the observation point, please. Let's wait a little longer. - We'll stop later. - Give me a break. Let's stop for a little while. We'll stop for a while, grab some energy to go on with our journey. Do you want some? This product has an advantage: it erases your memory in a slow and safe way. I don't want to erase anything. If you die, you will have nothing to erase, nothing to forget or to remember. Poor thing. - He's screwed. - Don't feel sorry for him. I know him, nothing will let him down. Does he get along with his parents? Who does? I do. You do... He does... We do... You do... They do. But we don't. Excuse me? We are not getting along. What do you mean? Did you read the note I left him? - It's none of my business. - It is your business. Letcia, we are friends. All right? End of conversation. We can be anything else, but friends. How can you do that? He knows you like me. I like half a dozen girls. You like me. - He knows what's going on. - What's going on? - Excuse me? - There's nothing going on between us. Let's change the subject. "It's forbidden to forbid," remember? That's true. So... You bastards! I'm here! Come and get me! I'm going back. - What did you say? - I'm going back to Rio. What do you want, man? Cut the crap. Do you want me to tie you to the car? - What are you talking about? - I'm going back. I have to take care of things there. You have nothing to take care of in Rio. Of course I do! Go back! You will have visitors! There are lots of people waiting for you. I'm going back! Fuck them! - Fuck them? - You're going to fuck with us. - No, I'm not. - Of course you are. I knew he was going to do that to us! - He'll screw us! - I'm going by myself. Are you crazy? - You're not going anywhere! - Stop it! I can't forget the dead! I can't! If it's easy for you, it's really hard for me! Damn! Do you want to end up like them? Talk to him, Letcia. I have nothing else to say. - You know how I am! - Do you want to die? I don't want to run away! I should have put you on a plane! - Stop fighting! - I knew it! You idiots! - I'm going to... - No! Stop it! This place is so beautiful! ADAPTED BY VIDEOLAR
