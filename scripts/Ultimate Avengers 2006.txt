The battle for Berlin has ended, and Germany's unconditional surrender is expected within days. After 12 years and three months, Hitler's self-proclaimed 1,000-year Reich has ceased to exist, but what of those reports of a secret Nazi superweapon Categorically false, says the War Department, and we believe them, so to every one of our brave Gls soon to be home... Hey, Chuck, can that radio! Like we need to be thinking about home at a time like this. Say sauerkraut. Your best scowl yet, Kowalsky. So they got a superweapon. We got one, too. You mean that poster boy for the recruitment office? He's gonna die down there just like the rest of us. Captain. Drop zone, sir. All right, let's do this. Let's go. Go! Go! Go! Where's your Super Soldier, Barnes? We're getting blown to pieces! Here he comes! Okay, soldiers, let's take this dump! So that's their superweapon. Kleiser. This war is over, and you have lost. Haven't you heard? Hitler's dead! Patriotic fool! Look around you. This isn't about Hitler! Cap. My dearest Gail, My only regret is that I couldn't see you one last time, but I know in my heart that we will meet again in this life or the next. Love, Steve. Still nothing, General. - Professor Ross? - Hold on. I'm realigning inertial navigation systems. Here we go. A new one? Multiply that by 60-plus years Glacial mass off the starboard bow! All stop. Where? One hundred and eighty-two meters straight ahead, inside that glacier. Well, l'll be damned. l wanna minimize any undue trauma to the cadaver. Again, nice work, Professor. l'll let you be the one to inform Dr. Banner. Thank you, General. Dr. Banner? Excuse me. Sir? You were telling us the reason we've been assigned to the Program. Right, well, let's see. Yes, General Fury. so he's beefing up my staff. The Super Soldierserum, the same one that elevated a frail enlisted man to the peak of human physical perfection. It's useless, thanks to the inept record keepers of 1040, at the end of World War II. Then what data are we basing our trials on? A 4,000-page hypothesis, You'll note that we have for whom we're developoing It's unique for every person, only I am authorized to handle their blood samples. But, then, what will we be doing? It's what administers the serum. Any questions? Any questions not about the Hulk? We found him! How's the body? Any damage? None that I could see. I mean, he looks like he could just get up off the table. They'd better be careful. The tissue could be fragile. Easy, soldier. This is not what you think. Everyone stand down. Let him get outside. A lot has changed, son. Did... Did we win? We did. Mission control, activation of Shield One is complete. Affirmative, Sat Team. Stand by. All systems are green, General. Yes, sir. Already? It's confirmed. Vibranium hull. Definitely a Chitauri ship. It's changing course. You can run, but you can't hide, not anymore. Sir, vectors indicate it's moving into orbit toward the satellite. Get those astronauts back in the shuttle now! Return to shuttle immediately. I repeat, pull yourteam in. That is a hostile craft. Affirmative. Patch the signal into the war room. We have a situation. We cannot break free. Mayday! Mayday! We're burning up! We're burning... General Fury, how long before you can deploy another satellite? I won't sacrifice any more lives until we can guarantee the success ofthis mission. Within the week. Then we will use that time to put a defense initiative in place. Jumpstart Project Avenger. With all due respect, that would be a mistake. Begin recruitment efforts immediately. You have our short list. They won't take orders from me oranyone else. Now that we've found Captain America... That is all, General. They're just making sure he's stable. Still, I should be in there. - What? - I don't know. I know. No, Betty, I mean our problems. Look, I know things have been bad. l've screwed things up, Stop it! Just stop it! This isn't about us. - Why? - Why? Because it's never different. You'll never have it under control, and I can't live like that, not anymore. Banner, how soon before there's a working trial on that serum? - It's hard to say. Four weeks maybe. - No good. The entire program is circling the drain. They can't do that! l need results, fast. Then take me off my meds. - They're slowing me down. - No! We all remember the last time you tried that, Banner. They're still rebuilding the city. We're still waiting for components from Stark Enterprises, and I can't get a hold of Tony. Don't worry about it. I know how to get his attention. Sorry for the delay, Mr. Fortier. Next week at the latest. I'll have what he's having. Are you really Russian, or are you just trying to make an impression? I try nothing. Let's start again. I'm Tony. Stark, I know. I saw your name on the building. - And you are? - Unimpressed. You're not gonna make this easy, are you? Would you like me to? - Let's start with your name. - Not here. In private. Is this private enough? Natalia Romanoff. As in the Black Widow? I prefer to call her my number one. You're a hard man to pin down, Tony. Not really, given the proper motivation. Where are my parts? Try and be more specific. l supply SHIELD with many parts. You do, don't you? Could be you're overextended. Too many fat military contracts? Nice, Fury. Bully the man who put SHIELD on the map. It was my impression we put you on the map. Your parts were shipped out this afternoon. Now, we both know you're not here busting my chops - What do you really want? - This guy. - Iron Man? Why come to me? - I think you know him. In fact, I think he came to you for his armor. Please, I'm insulted. Stark Industries doesn't make cheap toys. - Jarvis, who am I having dinner with? - The Governor, sir, in 15 minutes. I'm free for nightcaps later. Interested? You can bring your gun. Maybe later. So long, Fury. This isn't a game, Stark. l want your help on this. All right, if it's that important, l'll supply you with my latest line of armaments, Jarvis, send Fury home with a couple of my new plasma cannons. Certainly, sir. shall we, Mr. Stark? No promises. The Program still exists? But l... I was told that it ended with me. It did, but not for lack of trying. It was reinstated several years ago. What, bad idea? I don't know. I haven't been able to duplicate the process, but I will. We're kind of hoping you'll help us with that, which is why l'd like to take a blood sample if that's okay. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. It means that much to you? It's everything to me. Here, this was in your jacket. I wanted to make sure you got it back. Is she still alive? Yes, but there's something you should know. It's a diffrent city than he remembers. - Man, I hate ants. - I know. Still holding a grudge, I see. No, I look at it this way. You got what you deserved. Good to see you've matured, Hank. - Is she expecting you? - Yes, I am. Don't forget your ants. I'll never understand what you see in that guy. Yeah, unfortunately, he doesn't see it, either, Good to know I can still inspire people. So what brings you to Brooklyn? We're forming a team, Janet. I believe you'd be an asset. We've got a problem that's more than SHIELD can handle. Sorry, but I can't tell you any more than that. I don't know, Nick. This sounds too big for me, Before you make up your mind, I want to show you something. Yes? Listen, Jan, you don't need to beg Fury to invite me to his little party. l can sell myself. Just show me what you got, Hank. Never underestimate pretentious lab jockeys, Fury. - Tragic, but why tell me? - Iron Man is attempting to rescue it. Welcome to the team. Please. Please, I'm only part of a larger rescue effort. - Be sure to... - Target is stationary, sir, Hold all positions. Sorry, folks. That's all for today. I'm late for a tune-up. He's made us. Let's move! Ease up, Iron Man. I just wanna have a conversation. Okay, here's your choice. Either set down, or we're gonna set you down. - Right. - Hi, there. What do you want with me? A minute of your time. That's all. Ten seconds. I want you on that team. I work alone. And by the way, Stark sold you some lousy guns. Nice outfit. Really, guys, I can find my way from here. Go get a cup of joe or something. I think I'm gonna dye it black and then get it pierced. What do you think? The neighborhood's changed a little. - I hear they call you Buck now. - Cap! I couldn't believe it when I got the call. It's just... Oh, hey, what am I doing? Come in. Come in. - How about some decaf? - Sure. What's a decaf? I'm sorry, Steve, but for the rest of us, time moved on. - Has she had a good life? - She has. We were so devastated, and then, over the years, Gail and ljust... - Well, you know. - It's okay. Listen, is she here? She needs more time. I hope you understand. What do you hear from the guys? Everything I knew, everyone I cared for, they're all gone. You haven't lost everything, son. You still have your country, and we need you now more than ever. Why me, General? Because you're the only one who has faced this enemy and defeated them. Well, I do. Here, get to know your team. What's his story? He flies, hurls lightning, makes rain. That sort of thing. Some, but this guy thinks he can do it because he's Thor. I think he's a few rounds short of a full clip, but there's no getting over those powers of his. I have faced down the frost giants of Jotumheim, so your threats matter nothing to me, whale killer. I won't be warning you again. Either turn around and let us pass, or things will get serious. We don't want your kind around here. Oh, but things are serious, and though we are but peaceful demonstrators, do not assume we cannot be provoked. Like that. Return to port. Please, wait for me below. Nicholas Fury, never a pleasure. Hello, Goldilocks. I don't believe we've met. We have not, officially. Thirsty? Asgardian mead, nectar of the gods. - Guaranteed to make you feel immortal. - No, thanks. I hope you are not here to arrest us for our recent protests in Washington, General. Until you were provoked. Yes, I know. We're forming a team to fend off a global threat, so what do you say? This. And this. Go back to your paymasters, General, - Thor... - Not interested. But at the very least, your team will have a conscience. Safe passage, my friend. You, too. Sir, what happened down there? Were we attacked? Yeah, by Bruce Banner. There's a monster inside the good doctor. That's what happens when a guy shares space with an explosion of gamma radiation and survives. Every time he finds himself even a little upset, He becomes raw, unleashed rage, a hulking monster right out of your worst nightmares. That's Captain America? He looks so young. Yeah, well, he's about 60 years too old for you, so you can pick your tongue up off the floor now. So, Fury, who have you got in mind to lead this little scout troop? Kind of early for a promotion, isn't it, Pym? All right, everyone listen up. You'll be working as a unit under the command of Captain America. Great. We'll all end up on ice. So let's get started. Pym, that's enough. Okay, now that we're all here. a nuclear warhead. Fortunately, it was scuttled before it could reach Washington, Oh, come on. Little green men? Mr. Pym, I have seen these things. They've killed my men, so they are very real. And just before they went into hiding, the unit photographer took these. The Germans called them Chitauri. and like to buzz our nuclear power plants and military facilities. We finally figured out how to track them, This is what they thought of that idea. We're burning up! We're burning... Oh, my God. One of their ships was destroyed when the Nazi warhead detonated. That was our first lucky break. We got this hull panel and some fragments. - What kind of alloy is this? - Unknown. but whatever it is, it absorbs energy like a sponge. Well, nothing except more vibranium. Unfortunately, the amount we've recovered is minimal. Tony will just backburner us for the next 12 months. I don't know how you guys put up with that arrogant jerk. - Am I correct? - I never said this was gonna be easy, so if any of you want out, tell me now. l had to learn everything about you. You'll be happy to know that the analysis of your blood has yielded exciting results. Dr. Banner, I know about the Hulk. You have to understand, the Hulk has ruined everything in my life. My work, my identify, my relationships. And you think the serum can help you? Yes! That monster is a menace because he can't be controlled, but the very principles of the Super Soldier process indicate that such transmutations can be controlled. He can be a benefit to humanify, just like you are. - Why? - All I ever wanted was to serve my counry We all have our place in this fight, Dr. Banner. You are a man ofscience. Use that to leave your mark on the world. We're finished here, Captain. Thank you for coming. Yes? On my way, General. Oh, no! Oh, no! Leave me alone! You've been ignoring your meds! Betty, I can't focus. You know the Hulk will destroy everything. I didn't ask for any of this. Neither did I. You're not the only victim here. a high-securify SHIELD facility was breached by a Chitauri alien. He then proceeded to kill every security officer on site. My guess is, he's after the Shield One satellites, the same kind they pushed out of orbit yesterday. the automated defense system surrounding the center hub. We've been unable to disable it. Captain, we cannot afford to lose those satellites, - Got it? - Yes, sir. Here's your new issue. The shield is a blend ofadamantium and vibranium fragments. No one will be denting this one. Well done. Tell me, are you issuing trashcan lids to the whole team or just him? Shut up, Hank. You waste vibranium on his shield when we need it for weapons? In the hands of Captain America, that shield is a weapon. Glad you could join us. Don't put me on the payroll just yet. Let's see how this goes. General Fury! The intruder has hacked into ourdatabase. Lock him out. I'm trying, but nothing's working. Our orders are to secure the center hub of the plant, which is one level below ground. To get there, we have to first make it past the automated weaponry. - l can get through without setting them off. - Wasp, not yet. Wasp! Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Take it easy, old man. Now you're gonna see what today's heroes can do. Iron Man, scan through the roof to determine the alien's position. I'll take the east entrance. Great plan, coach. - Bench your most powerful player. - Those are your orders, Pym. Let's go! The central corridor is clear. I'm proceeding ahead. Loading bay is clear. The intruder is still in the center hub, one floor down. I'm detecting what could be infrared triggers all around Wasp. Okay, everyone advance! Wasp, that corridor is too hot. Don't worry. At this size, nothing... Jan! Janet! - Wasp, are you all right? - I'll find her. No, Iron Man, stay in position. Sorry, Captain. Rescuing ladies is what I do. Jan! Janet! Pym, back off! You're gonna bring the whole place down. These amateurs! They're going to get us killed. Thanks. I... I'm not used to being rescued. Move! Move! Move! Help! He's not getting any air, and I can't get his helmet off. Listen, about that "arrogant jerk" comment earlier... Stark! I should have known. - Sir, I'm afraid... - Save it, Captain. I know what happened. and steal everything there is to know about SHIELD. and if Hank hadn't left his post, that intruder would have been ours. I was trying to save my wife. Oh, yeah? Well, good luck winning this without us, Fury. - I'm sorry. - Janet! This is exactly why I work alone. You two, report back to base. Captain, where are you going? Captain! Let him go. I will talk to him. Put the base on alert. We're going to Defcon 4. Yes, sir. And patch me through to the SSP lab. Promising news, General. l think we're finally ready. Good. l want you to prepare for all 12 candidates. Twelve? Well, isn't that rushing it a bit? Banner, are you ready, or aren't you? I am. I'll get right on it. Where are you running to? You have nowhere to go, Captain. Steve, wait. Please. Your performance today, it is to be admired, regardless of... - I failed. - No, the team failed you. You were not responsible. I told the General I wasn't ready for this. Someone could have been killed. It is not your burden. and whether I get hurt or whether I die, you are a man I'm willing to follow. Do yourself a favor. Don't. I just think that once General Fury cools off, we should go talk to him. - Forget it, Jan. Have you no dignity? - It was our fault, Hank, ours. - If we'd just listened to Steve... - Why are you sticking up for that guy? It's always everyone else's fault and never yours, right, Hank? Yeah, right. He's supposed to be getting the serum ready. It's finished? He didn't say anything to me. We have a problem. What's he doing processing his own blood? Where are the other trials? - There are no other trials. - What? All this time, he's only been working on himself. Wait! I can explain. Not if you have the Hulk. You're crazy. No, with the serum, I can control him. What? Move to Defcon 5. If we survive this attack, you're gonna hang for this. Oh, no. Bruce! What are you doing? I'll fix this, Betty. I promise. Stop, please! Get out of there, Bruce! It worked. Betty, see? I told you. Bruce, is that really you? Yes, everything's gonna be okay. Damn! They're shutting us down. Vibranium-tipped. I need to go, Betty. Get to safety. The Hulk's out there, but Bruce has control. Oh, this just keeps getting better. This is my fight! Stay out of it! Oh, hell. Good to see you, Stark. You're lucky. l had an opening in my schedule. Vibranium armor, Hank. Let's see what we can do with that. Serve him up. Yeah! Who's the chick with the hammer? Whoevershe is, I'm glad she's on ourside. Dr. Banner! Bruce, you did it. Rock giants crumble under the blow of the mighty Mjolnir. I fear this brute won't be as obliging. Betty, how can we stop him? What about Bruce's medicine? Will it work on the Hulk? Maybe, at 20 times the dose. Go get as much as you can. Leave him alone, Hulk. Fight me. Now, knock it off, or I'm gonna squish you. No! No, Hulk! Hulk, over here! Hey, we're not finished yet. Here! Iron Man, Hank, slow him down. Sure, no problem. Tag, you're it. I can't get a bead on him. - Wasp, distract him. - I'm on it. Stop! Hulk! Hulk, it's okay. It's okay. I'm here now. I won't let them hurt you. She's trying to calm him down so he won't burn through the sedative. I need you to stop fighting, okay? It's time to rest. Everything's going to be all right, I promise. Betty... How long has he been like that? Want me to let him know you're here? No, I wouldn't know what to say. Hey, Cap. I brought someone by to see you. He needed this. So did she. Now it's your turn. To Captain America, the man who fought to the finish defending this bunch of ingrates. General. I still can't believe it. It's finally over. Those hotshots actually pulled it together. Yes, they did. They had a great leader. br br
