She is terrible. To top it she has brought half a dozen kids! They well remember our address. I often left them in the temple... ...saying I'll soon be back. I'd fiind them sleeping in my bed! You're really nuts! Why are you cursing the unborn kids? Wrong! This superstar director husband of yours... ...is rehearsing his Oscarwinning play. Continue with these plays. But don't everwork. So, Oscarwinning... Tell me, this niece of yours who has come from Pune... How much longerwill she stay here? - What does that mean? She has nobody but me. Does that mean she'll live here all her life? Softly... talk softly. She has come to her uncle not you. Don't be rude to hertoday. - Why? - She's a very proud girl. - She's come here to look for a job. You've neverfound a job. How will she get one? I'm sure I'll get this job! - I know it in my bones. - Of course. My niece is the best. She's educated and smart. I must leave or I'll get late. I don't even know the way. Bye, aunt. If you get selected, negotiate for a house. These days you get quarters with the job. Also a car. Run along, dear. Or you'll lose the job. I've often told you not to eat chilies as it effects your speech. - Come, I'll give you some sweets. - Go and rehearse your play! Stop... right here. - Madam, the fare... - Oh, yes. Here you are. Pray for me. Can't you watch where you're going? What would you say if I asked you the same? This is an office not a jogging ground. - The way you're running... - Yes, this is an office. Not your drawing room that you're wandering around! Help me pick up my fiiles. You dropped them all! What kinds of people! I'm late and you had to barge into me right then!

Get her application out and read her bio-data. Her application is not in the fiile. - What? - Sir, I'll tell you... My name is Sapna and I've done B. Com in the fiirst division. Did I ask you? Didn't you fiile the applications in serial? - I did sir but... - Hurry up, Suri. Yes sir... Look at the state of yourworld, Oh God. How man has changed... It says in this... Sir, that's not my application. I remember mine by heart! I'll recite it for you. I don't know how the papers in my fiile got into yourfiile... Oh yes! You banged into me on the stairs... - I banged into you? - Don't you remember? In the bargain yourfiile fell down, so did mine. And in the process, the papers got mixed up! I think we should now interview her. What's your shorthand speed? I don't know shorthand but my English is good! What's yourtyping speed? I don't know typing but... I write very fast. I'd complete a three hour exam paper in 11/2 hours and run out! You may leave. I can leave? Does that mean I've got the job? Please call the next candidate. But... why are you calling the next candidate when I've been selected? A knowledge of shorthand and typing is essential forthis job. Give me one chance. - I'll learn... - This is no training school! I need an efficient secretary to run this huge office! You may leave! This is not the place to throw fiiles and certifiicates. They are trash for me! I came for an interview but he didn't conduct it! He only asked me one question, if I know shorthand and typing! - I said, no. He asked me to leave! - Did he say that? Yes. Didn't people work when there was no shorthand and typing? - Yes, they did. - Let me ask you something. - Do you know shorthand, typing? - How would I know? So there! Yet I'm sure you work pretty well. Yes I do work all right but you should explain this to him. If he'd listen. But he started off like a machine gun soon as I entered. I don't understand who gave him the MD's chair! You... don't know anything. I came here with such difficulty. I'm not familiarwith Bombay streets. I could fiind neither rickshaw nortaxi. Yet I came here. With the hope that my boss would be very happy. You're crying... - Why would I cry? - Look, my child... Tears turn into waterwhen they flow but turn to poison inside. Let them flow out. By the way, who made you cry? The Managing Director of the Oberoi group of industries! - That must be Vicky. - That's right. - You've brought me back there! - Where are you going?

Sometimes this thought comes to mind... Why sometimes? It should come everyday! That's wrong. Write again. I love you very much, dearest. I can swear by God if you wish. That's not a declaration of love. Sounds like a testimony in court. What do you actually want me to write? I just want you to write three simple words. But it's pretty normal. Can't we have something different? Why don't you ask me to write that? Great! My son is really working in office! Tell me, what he's doing. - Ask him. - Just an official letter. My son's fiirst official letter! Read it out to me. - What's the point? - Why? - You won't understand! - Read it out. - Yes, read it. One doesn't talk to clients in that manner. There's a lot of difference in yourworking style and mine. What will the horse eat if he befriends the grass? Aren't you ashamed to be lying to my Dad? Had I told him the truth he would have been hurt. - You should have let him be hurt! - He thinks you've come here to work. But you considerthe office a stage and continue acting! Look... try to understand... - I understand everything. - So I don't have to say a word! No sir. I can't be compared to you. You're there and I'm here. There's a lot of difference between us. So you were saying, there's a lot of difference between us. If it's a difference of height, it's very good. If it's a matter of colour. You're fair and I'm not. That too is good. If it's a question of sex, that's even better! But if it pinches you that I'm rich and you're poor... - I'll erase the gap right now. - Come here. - Yes sir? Give this to Mr. Oberoi and tell him he has only one son, Vicky. - What are you saying? - And tell Vicky, he has no brother. - Get it. Now go. - What's all this? - Let's go in the bus. All right. I'm willing to give up my car and travel in a bus with you. And you're not ready to give up the bus and come in my car! Is this how you love me? - What is okay? - Come on. Come here. Give me the car keys. Don't say anything to Vicky or Dad. Get in from here. What logic! I wish I was as tall as my logic! A little bit of peace and a little of restlessness Whateverthey call it... we call it love This happens to everyone sometime Whateverthey call it... we call it love I just keep missing you You steal my sleep of the nights Your love, my dear... makes my heart ache Sometimes we meet, sometimes we have to wait My eyes are awake But we both are sleeping In our own thoughts... we lovers are lost This is our state May someone believe it or not There is a little fun and a bit of intoxication - What happened? - I was acting. I came here thinking I'd fiind a good job. I neverthought someday I'd fiind you. Do you think I love you? - Yes. - I was acting. At the farm, I told you I love you? This too is acting. What? - You can't do this! - I love you! The public here hits hard. Quickly go and talk to your family about our marriage. - No way! - Why not? - Let my elder brother get married fiirst. The day that happens I'll tell them, my bride is ready. All right. That... that man! I'll beat you! Talk to me of marriage and look at other men! It's not that. He's the one who beat up Vicky sir. Let's see where he goes. Every week you come to fiix your car. - Why don't you buy a new one? - What can I say? Since I was fiired, I don't have money forfuel. And you talk of buying a new car! - Get the car checked. - Check the problem in the car. There's dirt in the engine. We'll have to open the nuts and bolts and clean it up. The glass is shattered. And the body is dented. How much can we repair? There are so many cars but only 2 mechanics? He'll fiix half the cars. I'll repain'the rest. You haven't slept? How can we sleep when our young son is still awake? I've lived the life a man lives. - I hope before your marriage, I don't... - What are you saying? You'll live to see my kids get married! - Wait a little. - If so many years go by... ...your grandma's life will fall short! - We've chosen a bride for you. - Bride? Who? - Not her! - Why? What does she lack? She took such good care of you in the farm house. She won our hearts. I am convinced... She will be the best bride for you - I'll have to think. - Keep thinking. - We've thought it out. Sapna will be your bride! One doesn't feel hungry orthirsty when in love. - But would you like something to pass time? - Get us whatever you like. What would you like, madam? And you, sir? - No point. - why? - It will turn cold. - Then get it cold. - Right sir. Where's the loo? I'll go to the loo and come. - What are you doing here? - Sir... I... You're so nervous as if I caught you red handed. Sit down. Get me a coffee. - Take this one. - No, give it to her. Get me another. - Take it. - Please have it. - Brother! - Shorty! - What are you doing here? - Nothing. Isn't she your crazy one? In the coffee shop during working hours... - what are you saying? - Now I'm saying it. Then the world will talk. Grandma's wish will be fulfiilled. - Shut up! - Why? - You are mistaken. Mistaken? - Nothing of that sort. - Sure? - Sure. - You're lying. - Not at all. Get up! I will come with you. Stay with me! Who is that handsome young man? My elder brother. - He means the world to me. - And the lady? His sister-in-law. I fiind her more of your sister-in-law than his! It's often said the boss sees the secretary daily and falls in love. No... I will tell brothertoday... Sapna is your sister-in-law. Don't even look at her. She's the love of your brother, his life. His wife... I love her a lot. A lot. - Brother! - What's up, shorty? - Car packed up? - No, waiting for you. - I wanted to talk to you. - Yes? - Like this? - Let's talk here. - No, I'll drop you to the office. Forthe fiirst time my elder brotherwill sit in my car! So tell me... - You'll go crazy when you hearthis - Just a minute. - Yes, Suri? - The papers you... - Yes keep the papers ready. - No more calls? - No. We've grown up together. Never kept anything from each other. I want to tell you about one little thing I kept from you. - You're hiding something? - That's what I'm saying... - Just a second... - Yes Suri? Shorty, just a minute. Yes, Suri? What? You still haven't made the contract! - You didn't get it done. - You should have told me yesterday! Write fast... Our company has been working with you forthe past 8 years. What will be the mode of payment before the contract is renewed? What will the payment be if the work days are more? What will the payment be if the work days are less? The contract is terminated if the contract is not ready. Here's the office. We'll discuss the rest in the meeting. I'm coming up. - Let me go! - How can I let you go? - We didn't talk. - Shorty, you don't work. Let me work. We'll talk at home tonight. I don't know why God is doing this! I will tell him at night! My mistake. I should watch my step. - No sir, I'd ratherwatch mine It's an office. Not a jogging park. In my case, the drawing room. - When I was new, I was scared of you. - And now? - Not anymore. I admire you. May I? - Go on. - No! Not Sapna - What's wrong with Sapna? Back at the farmhouse, she was so caring. She bowled me over For my family, she's the best I could everfiind. I am losing my sleep. I am losing my peace I am falling in love The world seems like a new place and everything seems pleasant. I am getting lost in your eyes I spent my days and nights with great difficulty Today I realise what is love Even I am lost I don't gain my consciousness... I wonderwhat intoxication this is The views are getting better... The climate is changing We both have started falling and rising in our intoxication Having come into the arms of my beloved, I'm aroused We feel lost in the shade of youth What kind of magic is this? What kind of a fiire and pain is this? - You haven't left the office yet? - The boss is still in. I'm late. Not late. Very late. And I've downed countless coffees waiting for you. I'm coming right over. - Take a taxi, and hurry up, please! Who was it? My uncle. I'm late, you know. That's why he called. - I'll drop you. - No! You mustn't take the trouble. - I'll take a taxi. - I wouldn't like that. Come, I'll give you a lift. Forgotten your bag? - Sorry sir, I'll be back in a moment. - One moment. He must be waiting. - Who? - They may be awaited at home. - At most, I'll be half an hour late. - Stop! Please. - What happened? I'll take a taxi. You won't get late. - Why are you bothered about my time? - He must be so bothered... - Who? - Why botherfor me? - Dropping you home is no botheration. All right. Tired of the waiting. And no news of the beloved. But I know, she isn't unfaithful Then why does she keep you waiting? - Moot point. - Show over. The audience has departed. - It's time to close forthe day. - Till this flame burns, I won't go. - May I take your leave? - All right. - A cup of tea for Vicky sahib, please. - What? Where's Grandma? - Grandma... where is she? ...overthere. - What's wrong with Mr Vicky? - God only knows! - Grandma, what do you seek from God? - He gives me whatever I ask for. When will He give me this wish for a bride... for you? If God can't refuse you, how can I... a mere mortal? You mean? Nandu! Murari! Come here! Quick! Call Balraj! Call Prem! My Vicky says yes, he'll marry! - Sir! Do you know? - I know nothing! Get lost What's it, Grandma? - I've been waiting for you! After you've heard what I have to tell you, you'll go mad with joy! - What could it be, Dad? - You can't even imagine! Your brother has said yes to getting married What's so great... What?! Said yes? To getting married? Brother, oh brother! Who's the girl? - You'll get to see, you'll get to know. - Right away. - Tomorrow. - Now! - Tomorrow! - Now! Tomorrow. - Now? - Tomorrow? - Not tomorrow, tell me today! - If you've waited so many years... - what's another night? - Tell me her name - Her name is... your sister-in-law. - Name? That's the relationship. Come off it! What's the name again? - Tell me. - Tomorrow. Now go to sleep. All night, all through the drive, you've kept me on tenterhooks - Now tell me! - Let me show you. - Show it to me! - Look... - No one at all? - Look. Properly. - But this is Sapna. - She's the one. - Am I the fall guy this morning? - No jokes. She's the one. Aren't you happy? Come on, what's wrong with her? - What's good about her? What happened to your choice? Look at her, she looks like yogurt. She's shorterthan I am! Mismatch! And what'd people say? Balram Chopra's son marries his secretary! No, she's a reject. - Find someone else, okay? - No Prem. Whatever people might say she means the world to me. She's the girl who has lit the light of love in my heart. She is the only one I will marry. I'll marry no one else. - Actually, brilliant choice! - But you just said she's no good. - Just joking. - Really? Now get married quickly and make babies... while I take a break. - Where are you off to? - Now that you've found yours... You've found yours, haven't you? Time I found myself one. - How are you doing? - Good you're here. I've got to take this weight off my chest. I think I should... - make a clean breast of it. - Why haven't you said it already? How could I? He was so happy. He would've been hurt. - So he won't get hurt now? - What do you want me to do? I was about to marry her. Now you want me to call her my sister-in-law? - You must. - Why must I? I'll tell him the truth - Why must you tell him the truth? - Because I've never lied to him. This could make him or break him. You have to tell the lie All right, I lie. But when he realises that she's his brother's girlfriend... - what's he going to go through? - Who'd tell him? Not you. Not Sapna. Then I'll have to leave this city. - Go where you want to - I'm sticking with my brother. - How can I leave without you? - Why are you crying? - Just forfiive minutes. - Let me cry my heart out. - So you aren't happy for your brother? - These are tears of joy! - Then keep smiling through the tears. - How? Like that. The signal has turned green. Move it. People will think you're insane Yes, yes, I'm moving - And don't you come to me again! - Don't you call me ever again. I won't! My brother's happy, my sister-in-law is happy, I'm happy! That's just what I want. Now get lost. Yes all right, I'm moving Not one of them cares! I'm in Panvel. On my way to Poona. The signal is very weak here I'll be back in two days. I'll call you after I get back Here's Prem. Put on the costume. Let's do the rehearsal. Move it man. - What's wrong with him? - What's the matter, Prem? - Vicky is in love. - Vicky in love. At last! Next, he gets married, and then it's little brother's turn. He's going to carry my niece away! The girl Vicky is in love with ...is your niece. Sapna What a joke! Now stop joking and get into the costume. - Don't you ever crack such dirty jokes. - I'm not joking! Is this something to joke about? Vicky is in love with Sapna - He wants to marry her. - Tell Vicky you're in love... - and you want to marry Sapna - I can't tell him that! - I can tell him that, can't I? - You won't! As her uncle, I will decide whom she marries, and whom she doesn't. And I know how much you and Sapna love each other You also know how much I love Vicky. I'd do anything for him. You know? I've done my bit of acting for you. Now I'm going to do it for Vicky. I'm going to need your help ...I need everyone's help. - No more directing plays with Prem. - What's the matter, Uncle? - What does Prem think of himself? - Why, what happened? That girl in our group, Sonia ...you've met her, haven't you? Prem insists on having her as his heroine in every play Even if she doesn't fiit the role. Guess why? So that he can go flirting. I just walked out of the rehearsal. - How come? Prem is in Poona - Where is he? - In Poona. He told me so himself. That's the official version for home. He's rehearsing. With that girl! Come on, take me there You? Why are you laughing? I never guessed I'd get caught so soon! So this is your urgent business in Poona! I trusted you. And this? If you trusted me, it's your mistake. Trust me, you're bound to be deceived I love you! How'd I live without you? You never even gave it a thought? You'll live. Same as before. I didn't bring you up these 20 years, did I? Don't give me those lines. I was born an actor. I'm in the profession too If you can take that, just fall into step. Like her. Who says there are only three actors in the world? No not Amitabh Bacchan. Nor Dilip Kumar. Only Prem. They do their acts on screen Who does it in real life? Let's do it tomorrow! My baby is so lucky! What a grand house! And such a good boy! One has to be lucky, yes Grandma? Still, ask Sapna once. - Why Sapna? I'm saying yes! - Here, eat a sweet - No thank you. You go ahead Well all right. She's my niece, but I love her more than my daughter - What if she doesn't like Vicky? - Didn't you see her at the farm? - She was doting on Vicky. - Yes. In her eyes, I've seen love. For Vicky Next Sunday is Vicky's birthday. We aren't throwing a big party. But this time I want to give him the thing he'll value most in life. - Make sure you're here. With Sapna. - You want to bring her right now? No! Eat a sweet. - One for you too? You could've asked me before getting involved with Prem. - I would've told you what he's like. - Get lost. I say, whatever happens, happens forthe better At least she got to know before things got worse. God forbid it, we'd have lost face. - In that family... Vicky is a more deserving boy. Siblings, yet poles apart. One is honest and hardworking. And the other... what a hypocrite! And it's God's wish that they want you for Vicky. This isn't happening! I love Prem. Make sure no one gets wind of it. Gone are the times when women would weep fortheir errant men. Look at Prem. What difference is it for him? He's still enjoying himself. And why are you crying? Come on, enjoy yourself We're going there tomorrow. For a formal meeting. Wearthe black dress. You look gorgeous in it. - No...! - This is for good luck. My doll! How pretty you look! The Lord has answered my prayers Now get married quickly and come into my house. And fiill my Vicky's life with happiness. Now stop directing plays and get into fiilms. Mr Oberoi will fiinance you. We're related now. Why not? Balraj Oberoi Presents Prem in every frame! - Super hit! I'm so happy! Nandu! Murari! Get the sweets! Sapna has said yes! Obviously! How could she refuse? What could be bad about my brother? Besides, it's magnanimous of my brotherto marry his secretary. - What is he saying? - She's your sister-in-law. - Now Grandma, what about me? - Later. - When? - Soon enough. Just wait and watch. Yes, here are the sweets. Come, give sweets to everyone. Sapna, fiirst of all, your brother-in-law. That's the brother-in-law And remember, for me, my brother always comes fiirst. All else can wait. May I reciprocate? Prem isn't with you either? - Where might he be? - He'll come. - He should've been home by now. - He will. - Where might he be? - How would I know? - Come on Rina, what's your problem? - I can't live in a joint family. I won't marry you before you start living away from your brother. - Afterthe wedding, I'll move out. - Not after. Before the wedding. Try to understand. He manages the businesses. Afterwe're married... - I collect my share, and move out. - Are you saying the truth? Trust me! What are you saying man? You want to walk out on your brother? Two minutes. Let me talk.
