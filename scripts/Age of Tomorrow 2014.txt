I will continue again love you. Will you tell me what is so important what you could not say about the phone Last night a meteor storm a lot of damage in the country. Not something we can not handle. But Colonel... - What? We have bigger problems. General Magowan, how bad is the situation? Mac, the president is so concerned that my phone keeps going. The Pentagon running scenarios. Their expert, any physicist will be here soon. I already said, my name is Dr.. Gordon. I have the General speak. Dr. Gordon... Have you come through security? - Look, he knows who I am. Sorry, I'm late. Gentlemen, the last ten years, I kept contacts between NASA and the U.S. Army. To bring them up to date potential near Earth objects. And when I see it, there will be a great this way. - My God, how big is it? With all due respect, if it so was the size of a satellite, I was not here. This is a quarter of our moon. We are talking about the end of time. And life as we know it. And based on his speed, I say... - Will it last for 48 hours until it collides with the earth. Get yourself a cup of coffee for the colonel. - You got it. Check out the seriousness of the situation. - Yes, sir. I have to keep this thing in mind. I will keep you informed. Mac, you have the best educated people. Now we need the best. There must be one of us fly to that rock, and get him out of the course of the earth. Captain Captain James Wheeler is coming. Are you familiar with this mission? Heard that he is negligent. Has anyone lost on his last mission. Decide that, but once he is. Now we have to spend a great alarm. People move to bunkers and shelters. God help us. - Yes. Had to happen again on my day off. Sorry, Chris. five men did not show up. They have not even been called. The meteor shower keeps us pretty busy. There are fires all over the city. I want injectors that windows there. - Come on. Is there anyone inside? - No, LAPD said everyone was out. I do not think so. Are you ready, boy? - Yeah, you old? Let's look up the heat. Did you get him? - We need reinforcements. There is no gain, just us. - Great. Hurry up, we do not have much time. I heard screaming, she should be here. The fire, is anyone here? - It's safe. We must find that woman now. - I know, is anyone here? Check those rooms. Safe. Where is she? - She's not here. Upwards. Come on, it's coming here, hurry up. There she is. Stay there, we'll come get you. Sully. Is it? - I do not know, I think it's broken. Yes, it's broken. We need to get you out of here, come on. - What are you gonna do, go after her yourself? What do you do to stop me? Come on, let's go. It will be okay. We're almost there. Help him, his leg is broken. I go back inside. - Chris, what are you doing? Is he crazy, the roof collapses so. Why does it take so long? - Come on, Chris. I see him, look. Is it? - Yes. What did you do? - The elevator was broken. How's the leg? - Are you better. Good thing we short path names are not. Excuse me, General? Colonel. Captain Wheeler, thanks for coming. Do you know Colonel McCanless? - Only through hear say. I heard that he was the best pilot of the Air Force. We're glad you could come as soon as in the short term. I think I had little choice. You are always very pushy. But I can be very clear. Whatever it is. It is no. I'm done. Ready? Why are you still wearing that medallions, captain? I said, I'm done. - He's very confident. How long will you torture yourself? It's been two years ago. You're a man lost and you have multiple saved. That means nothing. There's nothing I can do to change it. - Saving the lives of billions? Why am I here? - The meteor storm that sweeps away the world. At present, there is a huge asteroid towards the Earth. We have been told that if he takes... nothing will live more. Do we have your attention now? What do you want me to do? We want you to go there, dig, and explosives plant and that thing blows up... before it is on the earth. - How much time do we have Impact in 46 hours. I'm afraid this is a time sensitive situation. So we have a quick response. If I do this... - It will not happen as before. We will not send you behind enemy lines. - It's more that you send me to hell. Jim. Please. We need your help. He can watch the world burn-whether he can do something to change it. My mission... My team. No exceptions. Are you sure about him, General? Sometimes, Colonel, you have rely on your faith. At ease. General Magowan. Sergeant Clayton, exploration. Corporal Cabrera, explosives. Lieutenant Southard, communication. Fitzpatrick and Sanchez, pilots. General... Meet the Roughnecks. Al relieved? - That's me, when you get back. Captain Wheeler. I want you to meet Dr. Gordon. Pentagons most brilliant physicist. - . I just do not know about that If it saves, Doc. - Nice to meet you, Captain Wheeler. I'll show you. Your shuttle The SI-22: Astraeus. The Astraeus is made as interceptor with satellite and space emergencies. We filled up her for exactly one trip. So... So do not take the scenic route with her. There are things and drawings for which you have to dig and explosives should be placed. Do we get any weapons? - For the asteroid? No. However, for safety reasons, there is a closed briefcase with weapons. We do not make you trigger-happy. Great, so we got tickets to the end of the world, but we have no weapons. Do not worry, the government will be your richly rewarding. How richly? - Three. A hundred thousand? - Million. Start the thing though, I'm ready. Okay, let's do this. - Pack but. I think we see each other there. - We? Yes... Unless you know someone who these rock formations knows better than I do. I mean, if you know that's that cool. "We" will be. You did not think that I gladly would give. Get her out of there quietly. I just brushed her. Launch in less than five minutes. Do you think you understand this? Sure, after a 30-minute crash course to a trillion government unit to control... I get it. - I thought so Buckle up, everyone. Taking off in 30 seconds. If you arrive at the rock there may be problems with the radio contact. That's why we have these satellite beacon to to amplify signal. Great. I hope it is tight enough. Are you ready? You know I'm ready. - You were born ready. They also have drinks on this flight? We made it. Not yet, we still have a while. That was a ride. That can not be good. What the hell is that? Talk to me. Our set course is not good. We are on a collision course with the asteroid. That is not logical. Based on the speed we knew what Our journey had to be gently countries. It seems that it's slowing down. - What? His estimated distance has been established with the earth. It inhibits slowly. - At least. Everyone back in your seats. - Why? We're going too fast, it can be rough. - Hold on. Turn the thrusters on. Come on. Do you pee in your pants? - Do normal. What's this? Gonzo's rock? Team, all listen. You all have the coordinates. Find your target, and mark them with a traceerstaaf. Roger that, sir. Clayton, you're boring. Cabrera and Southard, you go back to the vessel and make the finished explosives. Stay together. Fitzpatrick and Sanchez, you make the shuttle ready to take off. Understood, Captain. The clock is ticking. Team at work. - Roger that, sir. Okay, let's go. Do not look at me, she's your tourist. I start here. An asteroid tooth root treatment the move, Captain. That is strange. - What is it? I drill, but I'm only 15 meters. It will be a tough chore to get deeper. That is not deep enough. - Go on. Roger that, sir. Come on, we should mark more points. - It is curious. What? - There. See that? - A cave. If there is a passage, there may be also a cave that leads us to the epicenter. We can load sites there, having We do not dig to destroy this thing. Team... we examine a cave since that a potentially explosive point can be. Keep going. - What, a cave? Be careful, we are next landed a cliff, so watch out. This way. - Take it easy, Doc. Captain James? - What you got? Look. This is not logical. Captain, do you read me? - Go ahead, Southard. There's something here. - What? Cabrera and I were on our coordinates marking and... And what? Something moved, there was a shadow passed. - Debris? Captain, where are you? Get ready, boys. What the hell is this? This is strange. I think this is nothing. - I've never seen anything like it. What is that? Do not. Okay, this is not an asteroid. Everyone, fall back to the ship. This whole thing goes back and forth. Spring quickly. Spring. I got you. Good work, kid. What the hell is going on? - . I do not know My god, go. What is that? Command Center, there's going to be hundreds bogey the atmosphere of the earth. Can you repeat that, Astraeus? Enemy planes, you get that? Warn everyone. Thirty kilometers from Saint-Guilhem-le-Desert, France What was that? My God. Please. Not now. Come on. No. That's enough excitement for one day. - Yeah, just relax. Have you seen anything like this before? - What is that? Station 2-4-9, Hansen here, do you copy? You see this? You drive too fast, stop. - Watch out. Turn your engine off. Turn your engine off. - I'll call you right back. What is going on here? - This is a limited area. What are you talking about, our barracks is only one block away. We have orders to everyone to move. safe bunker Moving? Under whose authority? That's classified information. So go back in your truck and I let somebody our escort you. Captain, what's going on? - An invasion. What's all the fuss? - This is not what you think it is. You're kidding. We gotta get out of here as soon as possible. Sanchez... Fitzpatrick... Enemies backwards. Walk. Clayton. Keep going. I got you, bitch. Everyone to the cave. - What, I'm not going in there. Cabrera, lie. Captain, help me. Cabrera. Come on, I do not think she's dead. It does not look promising. - We're trapped. What are you doing? There has to be some other way. - Take cover. How did you do that? I think it's the same thing happened to Cabrera happened. I think they have found a way to teleport, or a wormhole or something. Earth to Wheeler... They do not give up. It's our only way out. See you on the other side. Where did she go? - She's crazy. Maybe not, go. - What? I was wrong, you're crazy. - I said, go. Roger, let's go, Clayton. It going, guys? I think so. - I'm doing well. Where are my men? Do not shoot. - I do not shoot at you. That thing comes around. Where did he go? Hide. Damn, it's above the truck. What are those things? I do not know, I could not see well. - They have destroyed the radio. And killed my men. - Great. Whatever they are, they patrol. And turn off all possible threats. I can not see. - That's because we are under a truck. Wait a minute. It's Lindsey. Lindsey. Dad, I'm so sorry. Will you pick me up? On They came out of nowhere, and now we're trapped. Where are you? Are you okay? - I'm fine, there are other people here. What do you mean? You're not at home, where are you? I'm in the city. Dad, what's going on? I'm afraid. We hear noises, screaming and I... I know where you are, locking yourself and avoid... windows and doors, okay? Now tell me exactly where you are. They rushed to an old office building near Union Station... Dad, what are those things? They are dead, because I'm coming to get you now. Sit tight, all right. I love you, Dad. - I love you too. What's the plan? Major? - Blake. Chris Meher. - Nice to meet you. Listen... They have surrounded us, but I think they're leaving here. I think we can go come through that side. And I can see the weapons that we have in bring security. What's the plan, boss? - I'll go get my daughter. His daughter is not worth it. - She is not so nice. Dad, where are you? No, go away. Come on. Glad you could come upon us. Party - Where are we? I thought we were coming. Look at that. This is not South-central. What did I tell you? These things have a technology which is bigger than ours. They have come to Earth through wormholes. That's nice, but how do we get back? Good question. It is not that we can call for help. Our transmitters do not work here. Sure we can. We can use this beacon to us strengthen signal and sending. SOS But it's only for a transmission. - Yeah, do it. It will take some time to recharge. Give it an hour. - Beautiful, go ahead. Nobody leaves here without my permission, you understand? What are you, smart guy? We are on an unknown planet, You do not even know if there is oxygen. Do not worry, you can breathe. Crazy girl. That smells good. I miss Los Angeles. Captain, you should see this. I think we are in their backyard. Damn. That's not all. We are not the only ones here. They gather people. Doc, that should really take an hour? - Unfortunately, yes. We'll send an SOS. And hope they come soon. That's a long wait. - And time for those things to find us. Wait... And those people? - What about them, we gotta get outta here. Sure, and where? Pack up, we're leaving. - Where to? We go down and we save those people. Are you crazy? What about us? - Stand down, Lieutenant. These are innocent people who need our help. The rest can follow me or stay here with their thumbs up their asses. I said pack. - Got it. Can I have a gun? Thank you. We're going. Try this, the bigger they are the harder they fall. Come over here. Come and get it. Precisely, they pick Blake. Here you are. I'm glad I lie here. Come on. Deb, where is Shawn? Where did you see him last? He can not just disappear. I can not go home until they are returned. There are fires in the city. Call the police. Try again. Honey, stop crying. We'll find him. I promise. I hope you know which way we should go. We can not keep running around. So Do not worry, we're close. Come on. Holy Mary, are you okay? - Not quite. Tim, thank God you're alive. What's all the fuss? - It is the end of the world.

And there came back they abduct people... and bring them to their home planet. There are some... hundreds in captivity. We have found a way through one of their space transports to travel... and I suggest that you do the same. They are a dying, desperate race... and there is still hope to eradicate them. The asteroid is a launch pad... Fly there and shoot a bomb in the cave that we have highlighted. traceerstaven with That will make him explode. My... My entire team, they died as heroes.
