He's drunk again, isn't he? - He's gonna beat me again. - Not if I can help it. Argh! - Let's go! - Go! I ain't gonna leave you. I'm the only one who can handle him. - All right. But stay right behind me. - OK. OK. Why, Papa? Why'd you have to go hurt my brother? Family is sacred, Papa. You know I'd never hurt you. Not even for this. Hey, you took it. Ah! Stupid kid. Argh! Watch over this as you would watch over me. Eli, you said you'd be right behind me. Where is he? Let's go. He can do what he wants to me. But he's not hurting you, OK? We've just got to stay together, right? Right. Come on. Let's go. These boys will be in your care until the adoption. They've had it rough. It may take a while for them to get used to their new surroundings. 'The 6:18 from Lincoln, Nebraska, now arriving at Gate 10.' - They've never seen... - A city. I know you know. You're nervous. - But listen to me... - That's them. I'll get them. Stay calm. Mm. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. - You're too young to have a teenage son. - Stop it. William and Amanda, meet your new boys. Hi, Eli. Josh. - Welcome to Chicago. - We're really glad you're here. '692. 'White male. 45 years. About 180lbs. ' 'Welcome. Would you like to make a call? 'Hang up and try again. ' Well, this is it. Home, sweet home. You ready? Whoa, this is great. Bigger than our trailer, huh, Eli? You have nice things, Mrs Porter. Let's go upstairs. I'll show you your room. All right. This way. We got kids in the house. And this is our room. If you need anything, we're just down the hall. All we ask is that you knock before you come in. Joshua! Please, could you put that down? Uh, it's very, very expensive. You have a very nice house, Mr Porter. Thank you, Eli. You don't have to call us Mr and Mrs Porter, OK? Josh, I told you not to pick this up. Bill. It's just a piece of glass, OK? Come on. Let's all eat. Come on. Come on. We've got a brand-new Japanese invention. We call it... pizza. Thank you, John. Sit down now. Do you want me to help you cut it? For godsakes, Amanda. You don't cut pizza. You just pick it up. And you fold it and jam it in. Grace? Oh, um... I'm sorry. Would you like to do the honours? Let us give thanks to He Who Walks Behind the Rows, who protects our crops and keeps the infidel and unbeliever in the torments of hellfire eternal. - Amen. - Amen. Well, that's a real toe-tapper. Uh, pizza? I'll show you guys your new backyard. This is Amanda's Garden of Eden. She's got quite a green thumb, actually. The social worker said you grew corn. She did? No, no corn. Oh, I know! I sell corn. I'm a commodities trader on the exchange. What's on the other side? Just an old abandoned factory. It's not safe. That's why we built this fence. I don't want you and Joshua playing over there. Where is your brother? She wants to take him but she can't. - Hah! - Malcolm! And he goes for the basket! Hi. Um, I just moved in next door. What's with the, uh, clothes? Is that the new, uh, Amish wear? What's with your hat? Why is it... Why is it turned backwards? Joshua? Could you come home, please? Thanks. It was going to be a surprise. You have to be more careful. - You can't walk up to strangers... - William! William! I opened the suitcase and there's bugs in there. What? Open it up. Bugs, Amanda? I just thought I'd bring a taste of home. That's nice-looking corn. Hm. I'm uncomfortable. We're not exactly alone anymore. - They'll get used to it. - You think? Mm-hm. Don't worry about it. We'll get the hang of this. Besides, Eli is a gem. And Joshua, well, he'll probably need a little discipline. But then again, so will you. You're not doing this until we take one last look at those kids. Yeah. No. Shh! Be quiet! They probably always slept in the same bed. We'll leave them be for now. OK. What I was saying is, I screwed it up already. First he got mad at me for breaking his glass thing and then for talking to strangers. At least we've got each other. - Yeah. - Goodnight. Corn! Corn! Corn! I offer this to He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Come on, David, we know I deserve promotion. Besides, I got two more mouths to feed. Is that why you decided to, uh, adopt? Seriously, I mean, who closed the Agritech deal? Who sold the surplus corn in Iowa that nobody wanted? Me. That deserves some recognition. William. Too damned impatient. It'll get you in trouble. Now, relax, enjoy your new family. The market's not going anywhere. The market might not be, but I am. Remember that. I'll think about it. These fit fine. What do you think? How about this? I like this on you. It's a good colour. I'll get scissors and cut the tag off, OK? Well? Give us your blood. Give us your blood. Uh, Eli, you left your suitcase... I... take it you boys didn't like the clothes I bought you. No offence, ma'am, but modest dress is the surest way to a pious life. I'm sure not every kid at school can afford such clothing. Why should we make them feel inadequate? OK. Excuse me. Where is the principal's office? Just down the hall on the left. - Second door. - Thank you. This way. - Mrs Porter. - Amanda Porter. - I'm Father Frank Nolan. Principal. - Nice meeting you. - These must be your boys. - That's right. - Joshua. - Hm, close. Eli. Uh, Joshua. Like the shirt. I, um... I'll show you to your home rooms. - This... this way. - Thank you. Good morning, class. All right. Joshua, you'll be here, room 101. It's mine, by the way. And Eli? Let's see. You're splitting us up? You are both in different grades. Where Eli and me come from... I know you're used to being together... No! - Can I see you outside? - Of course. We'll be right outside. Excuse us. Take good care of them. Hi. Hey, yeah? Hello there to you. - I wouldn't sit there. - Why not? Cos I think you're gonna try to suck my dick. Hey. - You got cow shit in your ears? - Hey! Hey! - All right. - You wanna touch this? Oh, T-Loc. You're so bad. What are you gonna do? - Cut an Amish kid? - I'll cut you, bitch. Who you calling a bitch, punk? That's my sister. I'll kick your ass, talkin' like that. - Well, come on! - Hey! Back off. What's up, man? Come on, bring it on. Nolan's coming back! Eli, I'm sorry. You'll be able to see each other at recess. Come on, man! Come on! Come on, come on. What are you getting up for? It's... it's what you're supposed to do. When a lady's present? Jesus. You are from out of town. Waiting for your brother? Look. What you did this morning. It was cool. But really stupid. Don't start up with T-Loc. He shouldn't start with Eli. Come on! Go! Do you play? A bit. - Hey, Mummy-head! - What? Put the Amish kid in. - What for? - Cos I say. No, man. He can't play. Let him play, man. Hey, man. You got game? A little. All right. All right! Whoo! Whoo! That's "a little"? All right, all right! Come on! Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah! Whoo! We do handshakes out here when you do things good, all right? Really, quick - bam... bam... bam. Not too hard, not too hard. All right! - Oh, yeah! All right! - Whoo! - Good job, man. - Nice shot. - That was beautiful. Good passin'. - Man! Thanks. I'm sorry, man. I gotta go. Yeah? First you leave me, then you start playing their games. Oh! I was just having fun. I had no choice about leaving you anyway. You said we'd stay together no matter what. - You know we will. - Then don't play their games. Please. The wilderness shall be glad and the desert shall bloom. For He Who Walks Behind the Rows and all of his children. We are the selected. We will flourish on the land, in the homes, in the hallways and classrooms, the playgrounds, until the unbelievers feel our wrath, our fury, as we triumph over them, scorching the earth from within. We are the seed. And now it's our time to grow. For if the infidel and unbeliever shall pass over it... ...they shall be consumed... Bless my harvest to come! What the hell? What? What's going on here? Jesus Christ! Ow! Argh! Hallelujah! - Why won't you listen? - I won't argue about a corn patch. If you don't cut it down, I will. Amanda, for godsakes, it's his hobby. This is crazy. All right. I will look at it tomorrow. Thank you. Jesus! Hello? Hello? Boo! - Gotcha, didn't I? - Yes, you did. - Come to harvest? - No. - But by the look of it, I could! - Yeah. - Want to try some? - Sure. OK. - Smells sweet. - Yeah. Eli! Where did you get this? My papa, God rest his soul. He developed the strain. Guess you could say I sort of helped. These are his only samples. I brought them from Gatlin to see if they'd grow here. Well, they grow, all right. My God! I mean, it's not even planting season! And this is horrible soil. And there's no blemishes, no bugs. Eli, you grew this in only four weeks? Do you have any idea how much a strain like this could be worth? Well, like my pa always said, "You reap what you sow. " Smells good. Bye now. Hah! OK! Hey, how come your brother never joins us? Excuse me, guys. What did you say that for? Hey, Eli. Why don't you come join us? Why don't you join me? Or would you rather eat with... with that? "That", Eli, is a friend. All right? It wouldn't hurt you to make a couple, you know. Maybe I will. My sermon today is from Genesis 37. Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brethren and they hated him for it. So much so that they sold their own brother into slavery and told their father he was dead. Now, Joseph had seen a vision of the truth. Joshua. Shh. You were right. Quiet. Joshua! ...shall often meet with defiance from the ignorant and the wicked. - I do need to make friends. - Shh. Eli Porter! Does my sermon bore you? Yes, Father. If you feel you could do better, would you like to come forward and share your thoughts with us? Thank you, Father. Who was Joseph? Who in hell cares? I do. And so should you. Cos he was a child, just like us. A child with a great vision of the world. For Joseph loved the land and provided food for our bellies, timber for our shelters, oceans to play in and air to sustain us. Eli! But he foresaw that group who wants to desecrate our Mother Earth, poison our food with pesticides and cut down our forests just like grass... Eli! ...choke the air with pollution and cloud our water with sewage. And who is this group? His brothers. His adult brothers. And Joseph was not about to let that happen! And neither should you! Enough! Enough. Go to my office. Now. When you're ready to apologise, I'll be in my classroom. Didn't you like the sermon? I have no interest in anything you have to say right now. It comes with the soup. You never told me your bro was a preacher. Yeah. He says he gets it from his daddy. You mean... your daddy. No. His. Oh. I'm sorry. I thought I told you. He's my adopted brother. Mrs Porter, Samantha Gordon from Social Services. I was going through some old files. I found one on Gatlin. This concerns Eli. Could you give me a call as soon as you get this? Thanks. Hello? Hello? Oh, shit! Spending my tax dollars for the city's goddamn lights. At least they could... Goddammit! Shit. Where did it go? Looking for this? 'You have reached the emergency number of the Chicago Police Department. 'Please hold... A path will be forced for the holy. 'The unbeliever shall be expected to wait. ' All right. You guys have a great day. - OK. Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Don't I get a kiss? Sure. Of course you do. Bye, Mom. 'Mr Porter, your wife is on line one. ' - I'm in a meeting. - 'Lt's important. ' Then tell her I'm out. Feel the texture. It's tough, almost like fabric. It's not porous at all. It's almost impossible to penetrate. That son of a bitch. If William's not gonna do this, I'll cut it down myself. Well, I've got some good news. I'm actually passing some of you. Not you, Jenkins. You'll never pass. I'll have you next year and probably the year after that. You can't even say what the longest river is in the United States. - Where did it come from? - Come on, Charles. You know better. Think of it. A strain with an immunity to bugs and pesticide and four weeks, planting to harvest, regardless of soil. You're holding a fortune in your hands, Charles. Why bring me in on this - something this big? Why should I share this with my employers? I developed the strain. Yes, I know, but ethically you're still bound... Fuck ethics! My, my, my, William. I believe that's the first time I've heard you swear. Remember, there are only two major mountain chains in the US. Argh! Sh...! William! Charles, I need an investor, and, believe me, I can go to other people. Do I meet with your board or not? Excuse me. - Yes, Eli. - Can I get a drink of water? Go ahead. - So sorry. - Thanks, Frank. What a tragedy. Call us if you need anything. Thank you. Oh, my God! No! Good morning. Hello, James. Hi. Hello, Jonathan. Danielle. Mary. Good morning. I told the Monsignor that I felt a complete reassessment of the English program was in order if we were to instigate the goals I had in mind. Seemed to agree, with reservations. ...and burn them in eternal hellfire. And these frauds, these traitors - they know who they are. Excuse me. Look, Josh, I know Eli acts a little weird sometimes, but I've listened to him lately and what he says makes sense. Maria, no. Just stay away from him. Believe me. You don't know what he's capable of. Josh, what are you talking about? Hey! Come on! What's wrong? Take a look at this. I found it under his bed this morning. Oh, Jesus! I know he's your brother, but shouldn't you show someone? William would think I drew it. Show it to Father Nolan. - No. I can't. - Why not? Because... we're brothers. - Adopted brothers. - Maria, look. Eli and I have been through a lot together, you know? We've always looked out for each other - made each other feel safe. Well, you feel safe with Malcolm, don't you? - Yeah. - And with me? What... what's wrong? I've never, uh... ...never really done this before. It's simple. That's first base. That's second base. So... how do I get a home run? You don't. Malcolm! Come on, man. Me and Maria are just friends. No, Josh! No, man, no! She's my sister, OK? No. I put it to you this way. I just don't want her getting involved with a family like yours. Especially your screwed-up brother. Eli? What does he have to do with anything? Come on, Josh! Don't be stupid, man! Look at this place! It's deserted! It's supposed to be packed. School's out. Let me ask you something. Who do you think they're with? I'm outta here, man! With age comes blindness. But we who are young, we are the keepers of a vision of purity. That is the gift to us from He Who Walks Behind the Rows. So we may work his will - his will to cleanse the world of wickedness - our greatest harvest to come. Harvest this, motherfucker. Howdy. Hey, don't give me that goddamn Gomer Pyle, howdy-doody bullshit. We came to get Dee. Can't spare him. Well, what you gonna do, man? Preach me to death? Try me. Hey! Come back here, you little shit. Come back here! I'm gonna kick your little ass Doo-dah, doo-dah Hey, where you at, butthead? - Come on! You're in here with me now. - I'm not in here with you. You're in here with me. Oh! Fuck! Oh, you dead, now. Argh! Get it off! Get it off of me! Get it off of me! Get it off of me! Help! Help me! Help me! Help me! - Help me! - I can, you know. The question is, will you help me? Yeah, yeah. OK. Get it off of me! It's got me! Then let us pray. I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And that concludes my sermon... ...on Revelations. Does anyone have any questions? Look, Frank, you asked me my opinion as head counsellor, and I'm giving it to you. These last few weeks there's been no smoking in the bathrooms, no fighting in the hallways, no drugs, no knives... Face it, things are finally shaping up around here. - Shaping up into what? - Into something decent. Are you blind, Frank? Haven't you noticed? Things have never been this good. It was a lie that Noah led the world to rebirth for had it not been for his children - his children to fulfil his every wish - they would have never witnessed the earth's corruption and understand that the old had to be washed away, one way or another. Hey, man. - Hey. - Look, Josh, uh... I'm sorry. No, don't worry about it. I just wanna say, look, whatever you are, you are definitely... not him. I want to ask you something, man, just out of curiosity. What happened to his parents? He said they disappeared. Yeah. Just like your daddy, huh? I knew it, man. They're lost. They're like bad weeds and need to be taken out. Joshua, you should be in bed. This is no time to be going... Shit. - Hi. - Hi yourself. You're up late. Working hard? Just making notes for a meeting tomorrow morning. - Idle hands are the devil's tool. - I've heard that. Plus it helps me keep my mind off Amanda. This meeting tomorrow, is it about my corn? Yes, it is, partner. This could be exported to people the world over. Children too? Especially the children. You should get to bed. - OK. Good night. - Good night. What happened to his parents? They, um... He said they just disappeared. Yeah. Just like your daddy, huh? What happened to my father? Back in Gatlin. What did you do? Made sure he'd never hurt you again. Face it, brother, I'm the only family you've got. Enough! I agree. Package for Amanda Porter. She's, um... she's not here. Guess you can sign for it. Thanks. Malcolm? Malcolm! Wake up! Malcolm! - What the fuck is going on, man? - Let me in. Now. - You know what time it is? - I don't care. Let's go. Josh, man, if this ain't good, man, I'm gonna kill you. It's not good. Get dressed. Come on. Get dressed. Let's go. I need thy help now to end this madness... and evil. Oh, do not forsake me now. When I was 14, Papa and I moved to Gatlin. The town had a bad history, so the land was cheap. Malcolm, Wake up! Listen to me. So the land was cheap there. My papa needed a lot of it to work on his corn experiments. You woke me up for that? Help me, Lord. Give me strength to do battle in thy name against this... this devil with a child's face. He haunts my dreams. At school, I can feel his evil presence everywhere I go. Hello, Frank. 1964? No way, man. This can't be him. It's him. I know every inch of his face. Now, check these out. See, Social Services keeps pretty detailed records of their orphans. Each of these clippings is from Gatlin. Any farm boy can tell you each of those nights is a harvest moon. - You ever see one? - No. Well, look up in the sky and you will... tonight. Right, we've got to see Father Nolan. Get dressed. Who the hell are you? Father... As if you didn't know. Why are we seeing Nolan? I overheard him in the cafeteria. He might understand. You knew who I was from the moment you laid eyes on me. So did my poor foster mother. Certain people can do that, Frank. I don't know why. To stop you! Sure, Frank. Give it your best shot. Sorry. I'll kill you! Now let us pray. - Pray to me, Frank. - No. Frank, pray to me. No! All right, then. What are you doing? You won't get away with this. You can't get away with this! Father? He's not here. - Let's try the chapel. - Chapel, chapel, chapel. Dear Frank, thank you. Thank you for living just long enough to see all your work destroyed, your students turned against you... - I will... - What? What, Frank? Destroy me? With what? This? Your Bible is no match for mine. Show it to me and we'll see. Frank, Frank, Frank, do you think I'd be stupid enough to keep it with me? Why would that be stupid? Come on, Malcolm. Is that where you're vulnerable, Eli? It is, isn't it? I don't have time for this. It is! It is! It is, it is! You can't hide from God! Father Nolan! Father Nolan! Are you OK? Father, what's happening? Come on, Malcolm. Father? No, no! Oh, no! Oh, my God! Go! Ugh! Father? Father? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Father, what happened? What's going on, man? His Bible. What? - What's he talking about? - Get it. Destroy it! The Bible? What's he talking about? Whose bible? - Father, whose bible? - Eli... Eli's Bible. Back in Gatlin. Come on. Josh? Josh! Hi there, Maria. Partnership with Germany is complete. Congratulations. Let's have a drink. Good idea. It's time for dinner. Your parents are expecting us. That's my place. That's it? Yep. Home, sweet home. I think he put it at the foot of the scarecrow. Which scarecrow? You take the one on the right. I'll take the left. Mmm! This is excellent, Eli. So thoughtful of you to bring it. This is the best I've had this year. - It's my way of saying thank you. - For what? - Maria didn't tell you? - Uh-uh. Go ahead, Maria. - You're gonna be the first. - First what? Diana? What's up? Diana! Are you OK? Oh, God! A good beginning. Don't even think about it. Hey, Josh! This one's clean! Josh! You're fired. Oh, my God! Papa? Oh, shit! Oh, my God! Oh! Shit. Argh! Shit, man! Oh, Josh! Malcolm! Did you find it? What, man? What? Shit! Where's the fucking scarecrow? Oh, man. Josh, fuck, I'm out of here. - I'm out! - Malcolm! Shit! Josh! No! Hey, you remember where we parked the car? Oh, shit! The Bible! - Shit. I've got it. - No, man. I'll get it. Watch my back. Josh! Malcolm! What the hell's happening? Josh! Malcolm! - Malcolm, no! - Argh! Malcolm! Malcolm! Malcolm! This is the night of the harvest moon, when the children shall leave their homes and all their worldly belongings to join together with He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Tonight is the night when we will purge the old, cleanse the earth and purify the harvest. This cross joins you with He Who Walks Behind the Rows. This cross joins you with He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Thanks for the ride. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Eli! Let us give thanks to He Who Walks Behind the Rows, for the bounty He has bestowed upon us. And let us pray, pray that we shall have the strength to fulfil his vision, strength to slay those who are corrupted and corrupting. For we - we, the children - are the purity of the lamb, and the adults, the creatures past their 19th year, they... they are... The beast! A time of change is upon us, for in this season it will be the beast that is slaughtered... ...at the hands of the lamb. Eli! Oh! Oh. Daddy's home. Whoa! Hey! - Papa. - Eli, what are you doing up there? Who are your friends? Eli, what is all this? The meeting went well? - Yeah, my meeting went... - Good. You've been working very hard. And because of you our seeds will spread, our churches will grow and our harvest shall be mighty indeed. Well, whatever. It's time to rest, Papa. Oh, no, I just got started, then I... - Of course. - Huh? Eli! Let the harvest begin. I knew you'd come to me, brother. I'm not your brother! And I came back for you. I have your weakness, asshole. Go ahead. Destroy it. I have to get rid of you and your Bible at once. Then come for me. I wondered, if this Bible was so important, why'd you leave it out of reach? Then I realised it's because you're like a worm. A worm has two halves. You can kill one, the other lives. This Bible's your other half, Eli. Now I'm going to crush you completely. Give it to me! Screw you! This part of the worm doesn't like being hurt. Yeah. Come on, Eli! Come on, "brother"! Let's go! You want your Bible? I got it. It's right here. Come and get it. Huh! Argh! Give it to me, brother! Give me the book! Maria, he killed Malcolm. Now! You really want it? Here! Choke on it! Argh! Maria! Maria! It's all right. It's over. Hey, man. Oh! Shit! Hey! It's got me! It's all tangled! Help me, please, someone! I can't get it off me! Come on! Move your legs. Run! Hey! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Argh! No! Argh! No! No! Maria! No! Maria! Come on! OK, hurry, we've got to cut the root! Come on! You OK? Let's go. - You OK? - Yeah. Let's go. This is just the beginning, Hans. Soon we'll be shipping all over the world.
