I so want to go there. Hello. Boss, we might have found Daisy. Chor, what are you digging? What are you digging? Daisy. Daisy! Daisy, Daisy... - Boss. - Daisy! She's dead. I didn't kill her! I'm not involved! When I saw her again she was already like that. Boss... Boss. . .stop! Stop, Boss! Is he dead? Let me handle it. Shit, that's what I want. But this batch is hot. I can reserve some for you. How much do you want? How much do you have? Get me 4 bags! Sure, thank you! I don't want anything else! Of course. I'll call you when they're ready. Get lost. Thank you. I'm not doing so well lately. I sold my car yesterday to get some cash. My clad was all over me! You really should learn from me. Play the perfect son on important days! It'll pay off... when the will is read. Halleujah! You need to sweet talk the old folks sometimes. Take off your panties! What? You told me to be sweet to the old folks! It's her birthday. We'll need a little present for her! Right, got it. Let me do it myself. Let me help. You don't get it, ...move, watch me. I think you have an infection or something. How many years have you worn those? Man, you're nasty. Let me freshen that up. Two whole years, what have you done? Say it, how much longer will it take? TK. How about two more weeks? Say it! Two...two weeks... Pull over! Get out and get going! You don't have much time! Yes, Boss, I got it, Boss! Qing Dao is foggy. Mr Cheung says his flight is delayed. He asks if he can meet you tonight instead. That's his problem. Don't tell me you want to celebrate your birthday with him! Chor, call Amy. Tell her to remind Daisy not to be late for dinner! Yes, Boss. Yes, Mr Yao. Remind Daisy not to be late for dinner tonight. I got it. Daisy, I'm just doing my job. Don't make it hard for me. Boss asked you not to be late for dinner tonight. Chun! Not like that! How many times have I told you? Leave this and out it open along the edge. Understand? Start over again. Chun, do it like your dad, then you can scrape all the meat out. Yes, Auntie. Try it. You'll be choosing subjects soon right? Yes. Did you get the forms yet? Yes. - Let me have a look later on. - Yes. Oh miss, you are so early! I was buying the present and you started without me! Happy Birthday! Unwrap it in your bedroom. It will fit you so well! Daddy. Sit down and eat. Mr Yao, if there is nothing else, I'll go now. OK. Yeah! I really like that! Scrape all the meat out! Daddy Do you know a place called Salar de Uyuni? No. It's beautiful! I did my research on YouTube. Since it's like a mirror, it can reflect the sea of clouds above. I so want to go there. But it's kind of far...in Bolivia. I've done the math for the tickets and hotel. It shouldn't be too expensive. Talk to me after you've quit drugs. I was talking about a trip! What are you talking about? I said talk to me when you're clean! You always have your excuses when you run out of money. How could you have spent it all in two weeks? Maybe she's really planning a trip. It's none of you business! Call Dr Lam. I'll bring her there at 2pm tomorrow. I'm taking off tomorrow! You want me to take your head off tomorrow? You want a heart attack? Precisely! Daisy! - Leave her. - Daisy! Eat. What has she got for you? Oh, it's a purse. She gave me a gift and wished me happy birthday. That's quite something already. She wants money. Of course she'd smile. Perhaps she's really short of cash. She'd only spend it on drugs. That will kill her. She has to go to rehab! Give her some time. She's still a baby. A baby? I am your baby! Happy birthday! Do you like it? Very much. Thank you. I'm going to take a bath. My back hurts. At 3 am, a fire broke out at a grocery store in Dong Wo Village. On arrival, the firefighters evacuated the neighborhood and extinguished the fire about 30 minutes later. The store was seriously damaged but no one was hurt. The cause of the fire is suspicious. Near the store, we found two bottles containing flammable liquids and some burnt rags. We believe this is an arson case... Should we ask TK... ...to tell his men to lie low? No need. As long as he gets the land we want, I don't care how it's done. Dr Lam says he'll do a body check for Daisy first. Remind her not to eat anything. Where are you going? I am staying at a friend's place for a few days. Open the bag! Give it back to me! Let go! Give it back to me! Let go! Let go! What are you looking for? Where does your friend live? Where, huh? Bolivia! - I told you last night! - Bolivia? You should have said Mars. It's farther! You just want money! Give me my passport! I need to get to the airport now! Let go! Airport my ass! When you're clean, you can go wherever you like. What is this? It belongs to you? Look! That's what she means by a trip! You're as bad as people think you are! Yes! That's how I am! Ask yourself, how do you treat Chun and I? After Mom died, you treat us like strays. You done yet? That bitch gets whatever she wants! I am your daughter too, asshole! Go! Go now and don't come back! Keep an eye on her. Fuck off, you ass-kissing bitch! The party starts at 8. We'll see Mr Ho as soon as we get to Macau! I am sorry, Boss! Sorry! I promise it won't happen again! It's OK. The police are after you, not me. Whatever you did won't affect the company. Just make sure we get the land before the deadline. The chief agrees to meet me the day after tomorrow. There'll be good news when you return, I promise! It Will be OK. It's fine. You don't need to go with me, Give me a call when Daisy is back. Yes, Boss. I've been kidnapped. They want $50 million. If you call the police, they will kill me. Yes, Mr Ho. He's not feeling too well but he's alright. Sure, we'll schedule for another meeting later. Thank you. Bye. Boss, are we going to the police station? You remember the retired Superintendent Ma? He worked on a few kidnap cases, We can ask him to look into the case first. Go home first. Boss. Mrs Wong. Shouldn't they be going to Macau? The boss isn't feeling too well, so it's canceled. It's getting late. Go home. OK. Excuse me, Boss. I am leaving now. - I'm going. - OK. "2 pm tomorrow, get the money ready, wait for my call." Leave it! Let the brat clean this up when she's back! Remember the case of Fok Chi-Shing's son? You think Daisy is staging her own kidnap for your money? If I call the cops and they find out she's behind it all, people would say I'm the one sending her to jail. Ask Daniel to prepare the money tomorrow! We don't even know if the whole thing is a set-up! Just do what I say! Real or not, $50 million is a stake I can still afford! Seen your son lately? He always says he's busy with homework. Which grade is he in? Keep an eye on him! Kids that age are impressionable. Daisy started to change at this age. Ever thought about custody? I wish. His mom doesn't want him to take after me. She says nothing good can grow from a bad root. I tried waiting for him at the school entrance once, to see who he's hanging out with. But he found out! He scolded me so hard... He wouldn't see me for two whole months! Kids nowadays think the world of themselves. Like Daisy. She takes everything for granted! Her mum died early. I thought it's wise to send her to the States. Who knew she would end up like this. Cut her some slack. Have a talk with her. I tried. But she pissed me off every single time! She knows you care for her. Does she? Only you know that I care for her! I won't let her have her own way when she's back. I have to be even tougher with her. Mr Wong, it's ready! Thank you, Daniel! You're welcome! Hello, who's this? Hello, Mr Wong! You got my messages, right? Get my daughter on the phone! One thing at a time. Have you prepared what I've asked you to? Did you not hear what I said? Get my girl on the phone! Mr Wong, don't forget who is in charge here. You are in no place to give orders! Just answer what I asked. Is the money ready yet? Yes! Drive your XX926. Be at the parking lot underneath Ting Kau Bridge at 4. Alone. If any cars follow you there, I'll know! I'm telling you, if I don't see my daughter... The guy knows everything. Is my daughter behind this? I don't know, It could also be a traitor selling her out! Traitor? That will be a nightmare. I have thousands of staff. It'd take a year to look everyone up! Not to mention the hotels and clubs you usually go to. That's a hundred more. And there's me... I have a criminal record! I am the most suspicious. If it's really you, then I deserve it for being blind! Let's go. Why this car? Who cares? I am willing to pay, so it should be OK. Let me go with you. No, I am going on my own. I work for you, Boss. Please let me do my job! Hey, man. Please move your car a bit. We need to work. Are you coming or not? Get onto Shing Mun Tunnels and go to Ma Liu Shui Pier! What game are you playing? Wong Ho Chiu, mind your manners! You want to give orders? Fine! If something happens to my girl, I can do anything! Think twice before you start messing with me! You only have half an hour. Retract the roof. Who the hell is this? Retract the roof. Where's my daughter? Where's my daughter? I've installed four cameras, but only the left one captured it. But the news last night said the bike was burnt on a hillside. It was stolen. There are two men! The one who told me to retract the roof and the one who talked to me on the phone. The voices are different. They are two different men! Boss, I suggest that we call the police. You still think Daisy kidnapped herself? I don't know, all I know now is that I have been made a complete fool. Chor, check it out for me. Even if she kidnapped herself, and is having a great time right now with that 50 million, I still need to know where the hell she is! You know that I'm not used to troubling others unless its absolutely necessary. Have you been seeing your buddies? No. Ever thought of coming back to help me out? No thanks, I don't want to get into that again. Something bothering you? Lost a few things. A Car? A watch, necklace, perhaps even diamond earrings. Monday, 9 a.m. Did anyone pick up a 20 years old girl with long hair, wearing a white leather's jacket, at Pak Sha Keng in Stanley? She says she left her homework in the cab. Anyone who had seen that please report to the office. Your sister was crying the whole way that day, ...but I couldn't recall seeing any homework. Then maybe she forgot where she left it. Tell her to try looking somewhere else! Thanks! She got out here, then headed that way. Thanks a lot! After the arson case two days ago, Dong Wo Village is in unrest once again. A conflict broke out during the negotiation between the villagers and the developers. The representative was besieged by a large group of villagers who were trying to stop him from leaving. So what now? I'm on it! Don't worry, no problem! If you can't finish that off, just finish yourself off. Yes Boss! Boss! Meeting dismissed! I asked a friend who works at a web company to check some things. Neither Daisy's email nor msn has been logged in since the day she was kidnapped, and no record for calls or sms on her cell phone either! This is the cab driver who gave Daisy a ride, Lee Wai-Man, owner of the car, working as substitute that day. No criminal record, owns over 10 taxi licenses. Estimated assets over 50 million. This is Fok Chi-Shing's son, Kwok Wing-Chiu's son, Tang Po-Kin's daughter. Daisy's wasted company, all retards! This is Mark, broker. Hangs out at B&B all day long, was Daisy's dealer. Daisy placed an order at him before but she never picked it up! Chances of Daisy kidnapping herself are really slim. This way. Ho Chiu, Master Shaw is here! Master Shaw! Mr Wong! What now? I told you we have an appointment with Master Shaw at 4. I am so sorry Master Shaw, I'm a bit caught up right now, can we meet another day? Chor, show Master Shaw out! I am so sorry! Master Shaw! Master Shaw, this way. Don't you have to go to Qing Dao to sign a contract today? What are you doing here? You said things have been rough lately so you want Master Shaw to have a look! I never said that! Fine, doesn't matter. But Master Shaw will be leaving for Si Chuan shortly and won't be back until next week. So I figured I would ask him to come over and have a look before he goes! I have never said that things have been rough! I never asked you to get help! Why are you still here? To the airport, there are people waiting! Can't even manage such a petty task! I am your wife, not your maid! The guy wasn't a familiar face. Not a regular crook. He said don't sell it, he'll be back for it tonight. Fatso, where's the Boss? Boss. - Thanks Boss. - Alright. How did you get this? I found it on the floor! How did you get it? I really just picked it up off the floor! Ah! The chick dropped it! Fuck off, you ass- kissing bitch! What are you doing? Move it! Wanna get caught? I was only responsible for seizing her, I don't know anything! Who got you into this? A gang fella, called Bear, he told me to do it! How do you get in touch with him? He comes to me every time, I don't know how to reach him! How about the other guy? I don't know that guy! Where is the girl now? - Wing, thank you. - Don't mention it. Cup noodles again, here're some take-away. I didn't eat dinner either! Full already? Eat more! The noodles are no good. It's not like mum's cooking. Things are different now! Trying to preach again! You mother wouldn't want the two of you... to be like this even though she is not around. It wouldn't be this way if he hadn't married that woman! He can't lose face. You talking back to him like that will do you two no good. Oh so he's the only one who can't lose face! How about me? Being such a dictator all the time, does he know what respect is? You're talking just like your dad now. He's all over me all the time! He cares about your well-being. Why can't you two try to talk a bit? About what? I can't see you talking with your son! I'm trying! Ha ha! Your son is lucky, to have such a sensible dad! Your dad is very sensible too, just give him some time. Damn, you nag more than he does! All dads nag! I'm damn glad that I'm not your daughter! Chor, have you ever hit your son? I don't even have the chance! Don't try it even if you have chance. I will tell my wife and the others that I've sent Daisy back to the States. I don't want anyone else to know about this. "Recipient 'Yao Kai-Chor', amount FIFTY MILLION HONG KONG DOLLAR." Invest in a stable fund. Should be enough for your retirement and your son's college tuition. Boss, I can't take that. I promised Daisy's mum that I would take good care of her, but I failed! I am responsible! Whoever contributed to her death is responsible! Those scums are having fun while Daisy died for nothing. Sure you want to do this? You are the only person I trust now, please help me! I am begging you! Mrs Wong. Chor, you're leaving too? I am responsible for what happened to Daisy. I can't stay here any more. Be honest with me. What happened while I was in Qing Dao? Was Daisy really kidnapped? Then why didn't he call the police? The boss said, as long as she was unharmed, he'd forget about it. Also, Daisy was very upset. So he sent her straight back to L.A. Have you seen Daisy then? I saw her off myself. Mrs Wong. - I'm leaving now, Mrs Wong. - Bye! I'll give you a lift. Oh great, thanks! I am so sorry. What for? I couldn't even keep an eye on Daisy, and got you fired. It wasn't your fault, I quit the job myself. By the way, Daisy had been missing for so long. How did boss eventually find her? The boss said that she'll come back when she's broke. Hopefully she'll grow up when she's back in L.A. No one wants to see her getting into trouble again. Well, it's out of our hands now. How are the fish at home? Any new fish? Keung? I told you to call me Jason! Ok, sorry Jason. How are the fish doing? All dead except one. What? That's pretty sad! Is there a problem with the water? They just die when they are old! Then let's get some new ones later on. No, I don't like fish! How about dogs? Dogs in public housing? We'd get kicked out. Then now about getting our own flat? You've got the money? Well yea. Still, no thanks. Why not? They have a safer neighborhoods and better environments! What if something happens and you can't pay the rent? Don't worry about it! Trust me! Mum would say no even if I say yes, since Ken is living in the next block! Who's Ken? Mum's boyfriend! What does he do? Is he a gangster? He's a social worker! He's in charge of our case! What case is that? Father in prison, single parent on welfare, that's more than enough to make a case. Damn! The factory closed down recently, no one would be here. You can stay here for a while. Thanks a lot! The number you have dialed is not registered, please check and call again later. "Bear tel: 50189056" Yau Gwat Hei Hotpot... Gee! What happened? Why are you crying? What did you do? I didn't do anything! Don't cry babe, don't cry, mommy's here, give me a smile! Give me a smile! Hello, this is B&B! Sir, sorry, we aren't open yet! Shun! Brother Chor! Can you ask your friends if they've ever seen this guy? Going to sleep? About to. What are you doing? Packing up. I've chosen the science stream for you. Dr. Lam is retiring in 'IO years. I'll be needing a doctor I can trust. Work hard, you can do it! - Going back to the dorm tomorrow morning? - Yes. Still have 8 hours if you go to bed now. Hey Brother Pang! At the pier. Waiting for a boat to Thailand. Don't get me wrong Brother Pang... You didn't return my calls, what am I supposed to do? He came to the bar. I recognize him, must be the body guard of that Wong Ho Chiu. Lost him. I know. Hey, the boat's here, got to go, call you when I get there! Hey, I have been waiting for half an hour, are you gonna do your job or what? Where is the remaining one? Wanna go meet your fella? Talk! Everything... Pang's the one behind it! Move it! Wanna get caught? Don't be afraid, we would let you go once we get the money! Tie her up! They want 50 million. If you call the police... ...is the bitch behind this? You think you can scare me with this stupid shit? Hey, how can she talk if you hit her like this? If she says the right, I won't hit her. Again. Retract the roof! Who the hell is this? Retract the roof now! How about the chick? You taken care of the bike? Burnt already. And the chick? He killed the chick. I really have nothing to do with it... How do I find this guy? Where does your friend live? Bolivia! - I told you last night! - Bolivia? You should have said Mars, it's further away! You just want money! "Soul Purifying Journey, Mirror of the Sky - Bolivia" "May all lifes bring the end to the circle of transmigration." "And find their destiny in nirvana." "Ahimsa." What's the matter? Nothing. Steven invited me to play golf with him. Turn him down for me. Chun. What's the matter? The Royal Academy of Music has taken me in. I'm enrolling next month! Sorry, Daddy, I am really not interested in Medicine at all! No. All I ever wanted is to study music. I worked so hard to be admitted. Did you ask for my permission before you applied? I am sorry, but I wish you'd let me choose! Bye daddy! Bye auntie! Give him a break. In general, this is the content. Is there anything that you're not clear? I can keep the content of the will from its legatee, right? Sure! But at least make sure that, they know our number and address, ...in case something happens, they would know how to find us. How many years do they have to wait if I go missing? for a death certificate, ...and officially claim the inheritance. If you call the police, they'd kill me. Are you alright? Are you holding? Are you holding? Give me some... What the hell's wrong with her? She wants some of this! Hey, girl, c'mon, try this! Fuck! Fuck you! Go to hell! Daddy, help! Let me go! Son of a Bitch! Mr Wong, Mr Chiu wants to see you! Ask him to come in. Sorry Boss, I've tried everything. Those folks are afraid of nothing, and they don't want money, they refuse to talk, ...I'm now asking the elders for help. Give me 3 more days...3 days...I'll fix it... What are you talking about? Dong Wo Village, the land. It's alright, just leave it. Boss, please give me one more chance. The project is called off, just leave it, ...pack and go! You will have you retirement pension! Boss, it's not about the pension. It's about keeping my promise. I would get it done. One last time, 2 days, I'll get it done for you! You once told me, that no matter how much stress there is never turn to sleeping pills, one'll rely on it. Sleepy, but can't sleep. Daniel told me that you withdrew another 50 million. Something wrong? What's the matter? Why'd you want to know? Well, nothing, just trying to be the nosy wife. I've lent it to others, stop worrying, go to bed! Ho Chiu! - What? - Something happened to TK! "Ho Chiu Group Staff killed in Dong Wo Village." I've told you to leave it, why you're still on it? How are you doing? Get me some water, my stomach hurts. According to the victim's wife, you are the one who really killed her husband, not the villagers. You're hurting me! What do you wish to say about this? The victim has been fired, how come he's still going to meet the villagers? You're hurting me! Do you feel responsible for Mr Wong's death? Police states that the case is still in... Since you answered Bear's phone, I guess I'm the only one left! Yes you are! Too scared to show up? Of course not! No need to look for me, just stay where you are! - Boss - I'm fine. I'm fine, don't ask me to see doctor like everybody does! Just tell me when it's done! Mrs Wong, we've been following Mr Wong, he's at Bun-Chun Yuen. You look tired. Can't sleep, damn serious. Medicine can't help, I always see the sunrise. You should take a break. It's not about that, ...one more, still one to go. Inform me when you've found those bastards. I need to see them die...one by one... in front of me, then I'll be alright. Why did you lie to me? Mrs Wong. I am your wife. I'm asking you, why did you lie to me? I said, if anything happens to Daisy, they'll all have to pay. You're the one who's not okay now! I'm fine! I know what I'm doing! Then are you asking me to act as if nothing happened? What should I tell the boy? Nothing! I don't know, I don't care. No one can stop me. Get out of my way! Even if you take revenge, so what? You're not punishing them, you're punishing yourself! Why so secretive? I'll go after Wong Ho Chiu when I'm done with you! Well, then let's stop wasting time. Wong Ho Chiu is lucky to have you working for him. Why do you have to kill her? What game are you trying to play? Wong Ho Chiu, mind your manners. Makes things easier for everybody! You want to give orders? Fine! If anything happens to my girl, I'll do whatever I have to! Think twice before you start messing with me! You have half an hour. It's taken care of, on my way back! Okay! I've just got the money, ...but then your old man was threatening me. I don't want any more trouble. It was up to your boss whether she lived or died! Boss, found him. Wong Ho Chiu, what's up? Need me to bring a message to your girl? I told you, if anything happens to my girl, I'll do whatever I have to! But I am still in charge now! When I get to hell, I'll screw your daughter! You'll die like She did! Go to hell, you bastard! I am going back to my mum's place. The medicines you're taking, I've put them in the nightstand. Remember to fast next Friday. If there's any problem at the company, call me. In your case, I suggest that you go to Cheng for help! I'm okay! Chiu, actually nowadays it's really common to have psychological issues, ...especially people in your position. It's more common than you think! I said I am okay! Just give me the sleeping pills you gave me last time! OK! By the way, Daisy came to me for medicine in a hurry the other night, is she okay? Which night? It was...Two days after your wife's birthday, her assistant came to me at around 9! You...you're sure? Absolutely, I was in a hurry that night, to pick up my girl at the airport! Why did you still go to pick up the medicine after Daisy was kidnapped? Huh? - Besides you, who else is involved? - I don't know, - Who else? - I really don't know, I have nothing to do with it - Talk! - I don't know... Everyone involved is dead, you want to join them? I don't know, please! No! Please! Don't kill my girl, she's innocent. It's me who did it, I am so sorry. Boss, I am leaving! - OK - OK This chick's having a heart attack, bring the medicine! The medicine! Girl, we haven't got the money yet, don't die! Her old man didn't call the police right? Go back and keep an eye on them! By the way, Daisy had been missing for so long, ...how did boss eventually find her? He said she would come back when she's broke. Hopefully she'll grow up when she's back in L.A. No one wants to see her getting into trouble again... How is Wong Ho Chiu? Did he call the police? I guess not. He'd sent Daisy back to L.A. Have you ever seen the chick? The guy is really one hell of a liar! Didn't you say you'll let her go? Just mind your share, other than that, it's none of your business! Don't tell me you killed her! - You said... - I don't need you to tell me what to do! You're dead meat if you talk! They only asked me about Daisy's whereabouts. I didn't know it'd end up this way! I...l am so sorry! Who else is involved? When will it end? Winnie, run, run! Leave her. Gee! What happened? Why are you crying? What did you do? Don't come close, Winnie! Winnie... Mommy... Mommy's here! It's alright now, mommy's here! Do you think that, I'm just trying to make myself feel better letting Amy go? Is there a difference? For her, no, for me, yes. It's over now, don't dwell on it. I'll take care of whatever happens in the future. Can you? There're things that would haunt you for life. I don't want to bother anyone any more. From now on, we'd better not meet again. Thank you. Take care boss. Jason! Oh you finally remember how to call me properly! What's up? The company is sending me to Russia, I won't be back for a few years. Oh, good luck then! Call me when you're back! I've left some money with your mother. It'll cover your college tuition in the future, don't worry. What are you worrying about? I'm only in 7th grade! Anyway, remember to work hard, okay? Right, don't you have anything new to say? Got to hang up now, got another call, bye! Okay, bye! "My beloved daughter, Daisy Wong"
