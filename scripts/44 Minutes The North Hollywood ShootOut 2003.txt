These guys were slinging|automatic machine guns. - An AK-47 machine gun... is a weapon|that was designed for war. High-velocity rounds|were invented... to penetrate armour|and kill their target. Use them in a bank job... and you've done something that|no one in America has ever done before. Danger's all around us--|in the streets... in your car... maybe even the guy next door. Come on. Drink, drink, drink, drink.! - Yeah?|- The music. - For God's sakes, will you turn it down a bit?|- Um, right. - You okay?|- Yeah. Let it go. - Aw.! - Turn it back on, man.|- What'd they say? Nothin'. - What's so funny?|- Our life. Well, Jim, Kelly,|the forecast, plenty of sunshine with seasonal|temperatures. Looking for a high|of 7 2 degrees by midday. Lord, help me to remember|there are many paths and one truth. Help me to do the right thing|out there. Wake|up, Larry. Oh, shit. Shit, what time is it? - Let's go. Let's go. It's the morning time.|- Make some coffee. Unreal. You know any of'em? Yeah, Davis.|He was a good man. We went through|the academy together. - So, you gonna mail those taxes today?|- Yeah. - Don't forget to get a return--|- Get a receipt. Right. Mm. Be careful. My father was|my hero and a legend in the LAPD. He died in his patrol car|of a heart attack. He was, uh,|he was 62 at the time. All I ever wanted|was to be just like him. And my dad was proud.|He loved it when I made SWAT. Go for a walk?|Wanna go for a walk? Good boy.|Come on. Let's go. See, we're SWAT. That stands for|Special Weapons And Tactics. And we respond|to any situation. Regular uniform patrol,|you know... wouldn't really have the firepower|or the training to handle. - Police, coming in.!|- Open door! This way? - I got point.!|- Let me see your hands.! - Get down on the ground.!|- Stay with me, Donnie. - Down, now, down.!|- - You, get down! Get down!|- Get down, now! Drop your weapon!|I need a trailer! I got guns.!|I got guns.! - Cover him! Shit!|- Donnie, get in here.! Where the hell were you? I got multiple suspects here. Donnie, what the hell|happened in there? You left me completely|alone. Yeah, I was there. Hey, you gotta|take it down a notch, partner. Don't worry about me, all right?|Wrap this up and get in the car. You did good. Good morning, half past the hour... and it looks like|another beautiful day in the City|of Angels. For the latest on your|commute, let's go high in the sky with our own|Captain Chuck Scott. Well, Jim, Kelly,|traffic's moving fairly well for|a getaway Friday. Couple of trouble spots we'll be|telling you about in our next update. Right now, clear blue skies,|wind out of the northeast by 1 5. And we will have a complete|traffic break for you coming up in 1 0. R.H.D.--|Robbery Homicide Division. We're the best of the best,|and we get all the high-profile cases. LA Confidential. Al Pacino in Heat. Joe Friday and all that. The only difference is that, uh... those guys don't have to juggle|7 5 cases all at once. Me, I've got to prioritize. Back in '95, my priority was them. We had a name for|them. We called them the High Incident|Bandits. Chatsworth, two years prior... these guys decided to make|an early withdrawal. They kill a guard. They executed him.|Ambushed him. Took his head off|with an AK-47. That kind of firepower|in a bank job is unheard of. These guys were an anomaly. I made a promise|to that widow that I wouldn't quit... until I caught up with the sons|of bitches that killed her husband. We make promises like that|all the time in my line of work. And we like to think|that we mean it. That time, I really meant it. Six months later,|another armoured car. Then, two more banks-- takeover style--|the most dangerous kind. They, uh, got away|with over two million dollars. I guess they wanted|to live the good life... and they wanted to live it|pretty fast... instead of getting a job|like the rest of us. Anyway, they disappeared into the|wind one day, but I knew they'd be back. Hey, did you see that?|A Porsche 91 1 . - Oh, I love those.|- I hate the Germans. You're from Romania.|That practically makes you a German. I'm an American... and I like Corvettes and Mustangs. If you're going for horsepower and|good looks, nothing wrong with that. Corvettes and Mustangs and Mexican|girls. I love that girl over there. - Morning, sir.|- Hey, Luis. So, what do you think|of my new wheels? Wow, that's great, man.|I really love gold. - Champagne.|- Huh? It's the colour.|It's called champagne. - Oh.|- Hey, keep working hard and one|day you'll be able to afford champagne. Oh, I sure hope so, sir. I sure hope so.|Dick. Ow! Geez! - You all right?|- It's nothing. Hey, you can say if it hurts.|It's okay, tough Robo-girl. - Hey!|- Oh, here we go... with that whole|''women can handle it'' attitude... because of childbirth|and years and years of pain. Yeah, yeah, that's|right. You couldn't stand the pain of|childbirth, Henry. Better you than me, sister girl. I tell you what I could|stand. You need to take me out with a salsa honey|and teach me how. - I can salsa dance.|- Don't start that again. You'll embarrass me. - I've got flavour. I got mad flavour.|- Yeah, I know, okay? - I know you can move it, but--|Central Nine Adam 3 7. Nine Adam 37, go ahead. Possible 4 1 5 family.|52 42 Radford. Nine Adam 37, roger. You're my little sweetie.|Come on. Just coming up over|the Hollywood Freeway where it is slow|going this morning. There's a SIG alert|south of Highland. A tractor trailer is broken down|in the number-one lane. If you're travelling north,|consider using side streets. They're late. They'll be here.|Just stay cool. I'm cool. I'm cool.|It's just so freakin' hot in here. Try taking three of these. It'll definitely help|calm you down. Don't worry about it. That's about it for out here.|Let me show you the vault. I have one key,|and Randy has the other, okay? - It won't open with just mine.|- Okay. Let me show you something. A little tool of the trade here.|You know what this is? - Twenties.|- No. Two bands. See here? Dye pack. Dye pack. Gotcha. We keep one in here,|one in each of the drawers. You try and leave|the bank with this, and the|battery... makes the red dye|explode all over the bills. It's the bomb. One time we had this robber, right.|He leaves the bank with this... drops it on the way|out, picks it up, shoves it down his|pants and boom. It goes off. I don't think|he's gonna be having kids any time soon. Did you, uh, get robbed a lot? About three or four|times. But not here. At the other branches|I worked at. Look. It's all insured, okay?|You never argue. Look. It's all insured, okay?|You never argue. -Just give them what they want.|- Okay. - All right? Let's go get some coffee.|- Okay. - Yeah. Yeah.|- Okay. At that point, I kicked the door. I understand the old guy|had to get seven stitches. That doesn't concern me. What does concern me is|that you went charging in there like some freakin'|John Wayne... and left your partner alone|in a room with four felons. I know you've been going through a tough time, son.|Your father was a great-- Lieutenant, I'm fine. That's got|nothing to do with it. I had a bad day. Nine thousand cops|in the LAPD, Donnie... and only 60 are good enough|to make it to SWAT. We can't afford|to have bad days. Now, you're taking|some time off to mourn, kid. I need you making decisions,|the right decisions, from here on in. Next time it might not be some|70-year-old man behind that door. - I don't need the time off.|- And I'm not asking your opinion. That's all. - Here you go, Frank. - Thank you, Ralph.|- Good as new. Should last you another 20 years. Yeah, I'm sure it will. - But what about me?|- You're a survivor, Frank.|You know that. Let's hope so. - Hey, Donnie.|- Frank. - How are you?|- Not bad. Sorry to hear about your old man.|He was, uh, he was good. You guys worked together.|77th, right? He was my T.O.|Kicked my ass every day for six months. It was a different department|back then. So I hear. I gotta run.|Gotta be in court. So, uh, look after yourself, yeah? - I'll see you later, Frank. Thanks.|- All right. Yeah. Well, I'm a training officer,|and Bobby is probably the 30th... or 3 2nd younger officer|that I've trained. A young cop needs to learn,|more than anything... how to leap to that training|that you get, mentally... when you're in|an emergency situation. Bobby, is it clean? It is now.|Morning watch brought in a hype. Found two needles|in the backseat. Uh-oh. You get stuck? - Had my gloves on.|- Attaboy. Tires? At least 50 more miles of treads left. - Twelve-gauge?|- Four rounds, double-aught buck. - Tank?|- Full. Coffee? Black. You keep this up,|I might let you have lunch today. Hit me, huh? - I will take you out!|- Calm down, please. Come on! I will whip your ass|right now. Let me go! - It's your lucky day. Let's go.|- Calm down right now. Ramon, how old are you, man? - Sixteen.|- Sixteen. That's good. I don't understand|what's happened to him. - Is he using or running with a gang?|- Hell, who knows? No more juvie hall for you, huh? No, you hang with the big boys now. They're gonna love you, baby. You gonna be someone's date|for the prom tonight, huh? There's no father|to help me with this. I'm doing|it all by myself. - I know, ma'am.|- He's a man now. How can I stand up to a man? - I see. I see.|- It's just me. I'm doing everything I can. That's a good move too, man,|joining Florencia. What's that, about two of them|dying a week these days? Nigga, don't know|nothin' about me, man. Tell you what.|I know this. You mess with|your moms again, man-- Domestic violence|ain't no joke. For six months, he was doing okay. Getting okay grades,|going to school every day. Then his principal calls|me and tells me he hasn't been to school|in two months. And you didn't know about this? I've been working. I get up early.|I go to work. I get home late. Mm-hmm. How many jobs|you work, ma'am? - What's your problem, man?|- Nigga made it good... now you come back to the hood|all enlightened and shit? Please, man! Ramon, let me tell you something. You recognize him? Huh? Wasn't he the leader|of your gang there? I mean, until he lost|his mind and his nuts? You don't like my book?|Take a look at my book. Oh, I got another guy here.|Check it out. Huh. That's O-dog, right there. You know him? I had O-dog,|just where you're sitting, just now. You know, I need to get me|a picture of you. See that way I can have|a before... and an after. Now, you didn't like|my picture book, Ramon? Huh? How do you think|you're gonna end up? How you gonna get it, Ramon?|Like him? You need to think about that. These guys are media junkies.|Robbin' banks in the morning... and watching themselves|on television in the afternoon. Hello, Frank. Hey. - Testifying in the Cortez case?|- Who's gonna cover it? You? Care to comment on that? Yeah, the cop.|I think he's guilty. Actually, there are|three cops involved. Well, then, all three of them|must be guilty. I mean, that's what you're gonna|say anyway, right? - Right.|- So now you've got a source. Back in '65,|it was the Watts riots. Then, early '7 0s,|the Hillside Strangler... and, uh, the Night Stalker. You got everybody|good and scared. So afraid, they couldn't even|come out of their houses at night. Then, along came the early '90s... Rodney King beatings, and, uh... well, by then, we all became|a bunch of racists, right? It's gonna be a|while. Judge had to hear a PI motion|in part 49. What does that translate to,|an 8:00 a.m. tee time at Riviera? - More or less.|- How long do you think? - Couple hours.|- All right. Thanks. You know, you forgot O.J. - Did I? Well, imagine that.|- Uh-huh. I'll tell you what.| Why don't you come by|my house some evening... and, uh, I'll show you|my Bruno Magli shoe, size 1 0 1 /2. I only got one though. I left|the other one somewhere in Brentwood. - Bye, Frank.|- See ya. - There you go, chief.|- Gracias, seor. - Payback.|- You're gonna get us in trouble, Henry. You see that kid|in the car right there? He's the one in trouble, not us. Sometimes you gotta do|what you can do to reach somebody. That's very noble,|Henry, but showing crime-scene photos|of a live case. - And playing preacher--|- You know what? Just 'cause you don't|stand up for your own beliefs, doesn't mean|I don't for mine. Hey, you don't know shit|about my beliefs, Henry. All I'm saying is|these days you even look at a suspect|the wrong way... and the department gets sued. And our asses get hauled off|before a trial board. All right? Slide over. Turn around so I can uncuff you. You hungry? I brought you some food. Here we go. - Where's he going?|- That's not our guy. Shit! Screw this shit, man.| - Can you guys set up? And you, don't forget about Friday.|- Yes. - It's your turn to buy margaritas, huh?|- That's right. - Luis, can you open up for me?|- Yes, sir. I'm gonna do that. - Listen.|- Thanks. What's up with Bagstrom? - It's on your desk.|- Okay. Great. Judy.| Morning.|How's everybody doing today? Change of plans.|We do the bank. - Okay. I'm with you. Let's do the bank.|- - Hello.|- Hi, honey. - Hey.|- Did you get to go back to sleep? - No, I couldn't.|- No, it doesn't work, does it? So, you, um,|heading anywhere special? - Going to the post office.|- Good to hear it. Uh, you, uh,|gonna be late tonight? I think I'll call it off early today. Oh, great. Okay.|I'll talk to you later, baby. - I love you, honey.|- Love you too. When you're a cop... you have to make|split-second decisions. Sometimes it's life or death. Then, everybody else--|your boss... and the police commission|and all the reporters-- well, they get to take all the time|in the world to, uh... form an opinion about what it is|that you did and how you did it. It's kinda like|being on trial every day. And sooner or later, I mean,|how much of that shit can you take? You wake up one morning|and you say, ''That's it. I wanna turn|in my papers.'' Everyone's got an S.U. V.|They're nice. Yeah, and they're fun to drive too. Shit! - Shit. Hang on.|- 21 1 . - Everybody down!|- On the floor! Heads down! Move and you die!|Don't look at my face! 1 5-A-39,|we have a possible 21 1 in progress. - 6600 Laurel Canyon. Bank of America.|- Go! Go! Go! Multiple suspects armed with AK-47 s. Officers requesting help. - 21 1 . Let's clear this street.|- Right! I'll get the other side.! All units, 2 1 1 in progress. 6600 Laurel|Canyon. Shots fired. Nine Adam 37, we're en route. - Let me out here, man. It's cool. Suspects described as|large males wearing body armour and carrying|automatic weapons. I repeat, multiple shots fired. I'm en route. That day, I was ready to say, ''Enough.'' And then... I got the call. It's not something|that you can turn your back on. - Stay down!|- Attention, all Valley units.|Officer needs help, 6600 Laurel Canyon. ''Officer needs help'' call is|the most important call you can get. That means there's somebody,|he's down, he's in trouble. I'm gonna put the call|out there, and anyone in the area, get|your ass over here. The way I grew up,|the LAPD was family. My dad was, uh,|a cop for 3 1 years. Uh, my mom died|when I was very young. And so these guys were the people|that I knew. They came over to the house. They, you know, we had picnics|together. And, uh, they were my family. You get|an ''officer needs help'' call... that means your family needs help,|their life is in danger. It's your job to get there. We got a 21 1 in progress,|North Hollywood. Officers need help. Come on. Get your shit.|Let's go.! Load up the .223s. Leave the MP5s.|We don't need 'em. Move and you're dead. I did two tours of Vietnam,|and there's two things you never forget. Your number of days in and the sound of a Chinese-made|AK-47 machine gun. Now those two guys|were packing AKs... and I had a nine-millimeter Beretta. I was in the wrong place|with the wrong gun. 1 5-A-39, I want one unit|on the north side. One unit on the south side.|One unit around back if possible. Hurry up! You! The vault!|Open the vault! - What? What?|- The vault! - I need a second set of keys.|- Who got them? - Randy. Over there. Randy?

Head down! There's something|going on out here. I don't|know what it is. Flying over North Hollywood|right now, where there are several|LAPD units... surrounding what looks to be|a Bank of America building. One Adam 1 1, we are on scene. Where is your watch commander? How long they been in there? About six minutes. This is 1 5-L-1 0.|All units, stay off the air. I repeat, stay off the air|unless you have a genuine emergency. Do they know we're out here? I've been ringing the bank|manager's office. No answer. I think I know these guys.|They're gonna come out heavy. I want containment on the rear|of this building right now. - We need traffic blocked off on Archwood and Kittridge.|- You got it. No civilians in.|No suspects out. Why don't you take the south side? - All right, go.|- All the way to Kittridge. Right.|Take another unit. - Ramon, I'm gonna let you go under one condition.|- Are you crazy? You heard the radio.|There's bank robbers everywhere, man. - That condition is you stay your ass in school.|- Fine. Let me go, man. Wait a minute now. I see you got|the cross and crucifix here, right? Yeah? All right. You take this. You're gonna need it more than me.|Go ahead, take it. A Bible, man?|What am I supposed to do with this? - I want you to read it.|- Which part? Whatever part speaks to you. Ramon, listen.|Before you think bout hitting your|mama again... I got her number, she got mine. I hit back. Don't end up in my picture book,|brother. Go on. Go. You let him go? Move back inside. Hey, hey, I'm the one|that called 9 1 1. These two guys just pulled up and-- Ma'am, we're all over it.|We know. You need to stand back. - I saw them go into the bank.|- You need to stand back. The 1 01 southbound|beginning to back up at the 1 7 0. 405 is clear but slow|in both directions. Assignment desk,|this is Sky Fox. I'm flying over North Hollywood|right now, and something's going on|down here, you guys. - Talk about--|- They're surrounding|this Bank of America. - We're not sure what's going on, but it's really big.|- I have to call you back. Numerous police units|responding to a ''shots fired'' call. What|do you want me to do? Bill. Bill! We got a live feed up. Bank robbery|in progress. North Hollywood. - I think we should cut in.|- Police response? Multiple units. Shots have already|been fired in the bank. Okay, let's do it. Go live. Okay, everybody ready.|In three, two, one. We interrupt|this program for a special report from|North Hollywood. Given the force out here,|they've gotta give up. Commander?|Hello? - Hello? Gentlemen, I need a land line. - You ain't gotta do that, all right?|- Shut up! Not the safe deposit boxes.|Open this one. - Okay!|- Fill this up! You, head down.! Hurry up.! I said, ''Head down.!'' Faster! Faster! Faster! Lieutenant, over here. - You want a driver?|- LAPD. We got a major incident|going on down the street. We need your store|and your telephones. Yes, sir. Frank, I need you to expand|that perimeter right now. Let's set up on these tables here. Down! Hurry up! Don't look at me! The gunmen are|still apparently in the bank. We don't know how many people|are in the bank at this time. Jim, Kelly, we'll get back to you|as soon as we have any more details. Between Sherman Way and Oxnard. I want east and west traffic blocked. - Air 1 0. How's our perimeter look?|- Go ahead. Yeah, we've got four units|it looks like on-- Where's the rest?|Where's the rest? That's all we've got.|We're waiting for our morning delivery. Are you lying to me? No, no. They reduced|the amount of money we keep because of|recent robberies. Don't shoot me, man. We are going to the A.T.M's.|Let's go! Okay. - Fast! That's right, stay down.|- Okay. Everybody, in the vault.|Get up! Move! - Open it!|- I can't. See? What the hell does that mean? They changed the policy.|Only armed transport can open it. Shit! We just gonna sit here? We can't run in. We need to get|a possible position on them. We rush 'em now, there's civilians|in the background, somebody gets hurt. Conflicting numbers. We don't|know who's still inside the bank. People in there,|whether or not they were shot. We just don't know. Hit the deck! Shut up! Don't look at my face! What's taking so damn long? Eight minutes. Time's wastin'.|What the hell's goin'on? We're burnin' time.|What are you doin'? Piece of shit says|he can't open them. Open it, bitch! - I can't.|- Yes, you can! - I can't!|- Open it! - We're hearing some more shots fired inside. How do we open this stupid thing? I don't have the combination. Stupid. Come on! - Move! Go!|- We're movin' out.! Okay. What are you gonna do now? In the vault. These guys weren't playing games.|The black masks, the eyes. That guy just looked|at me, you know. I'll never|forget it. It was scary, you know.|I didn't think I was gonna get out|of there, really. I thought-- I thought|you were gonna be, you know... seeing one dead Latino right here. You know. Go down! You all go down. Larry, we got the money. Who's there? Cops. - I don't know what it is. Hey, hang on. Go back! - Mike, get me a shot of the bank. Come on. Let's go.|- Okay. Set up right here.|This is great. Here. Turn it around.|Come on. Turn it around. - Some roadblock.|- You can't come this way. You have to find another way. I have an important meeting|in the studio in 1 0 minutes. Your meeting will|be with the coroner if you don't|listen to me. - Back it up and move out now!|- You guys are always blocking-- You can't go this way, sir.|You must go back. - And take a left. Go. Back it out now.|- She's telling me to move.|I can't believe this. We can't|confirm at this time how many gunmen. We are monitoring the|situation. We're gonna stay overhead|as long as we can. We are monitoring the|situation. We're gonna stay overhead|as long as we can. LAPD.! Drop your weapon.! I repeat, drop your weapon.! I can see two gunmen are leaving-- - Return fire.! Return fire.!|- Get down.! Get down.! Return fire.! Return fire.! Civilian down! - R.A. units are responding.|- Shooting hundreds of rounds. 1 5-L-1 0, suspects|are exiting the bank. They're wearing body armour|with AK-47 s. I repeat, they have body armour. Anyone with a head shot, take it. Guys, we're looking|at multiple suspects, assault rifles|and body armour. Do not deploy the MP5s. Leave 'em|in the trunk. We're gonna go 223s only. I'm hitting them,|but they're not going down! - They got Kevlar. Head shots.|- Aim for the head. Aim high.! Hold it.! Here.! Cover me.! These guys are|out of their minds. They're just shooting|hundreds of rounds. - Hang in there, partner. Jim and Kelly, I'm here live on|Laurel Canyon in North Hollywood... where a bank robbery|is currently in progress. What you hear behind|me is not coming from a movie set. It|is actual gunfire. The details are coming in slowly,|but when we arrived-- - The North Hollywood site--|- ...bank in North Hollywood-- LAPD officers-- Once again, we|are in a firestorm of bullets. The gunmen are now shooting|at anything and everything. Officers from all over LAPD have been asked to respond|and are trying to-- Being the wife of a cop,|you learn that every day... any day, could be the day|that he doesn't come home. So, you can either|obsess and go crazy... or you do what I did,|which is, uh, denial. I mean, you know|that bad stuff happens... but you just think, um... ''Not my guy.|He's too good. He's too smart.'' So, most days, that worked for me. But, uh, that day, it didn't. Cover me.! An officer who was trying|to help a civilian has been shot. He's down. I can't tell from here|if hes moving or not. But he appears|to be seriously hurt. Rescue units are|unable to get to either of them. All responding units|to Laurel Canyon-- - Frank. Thank God. - So, where are you?|- Don't worry about anything. I'm okay. I guess you're watching TV, yeah? Oh, yeah. It's on every channel.|They say there's officers down. Patty, look. I'm not even close|to the action. I'm okay. Everything's fine.|I'm all right. - I don't want you to worry about me.|- I'm not worried. No one's worrying, okay? I just--|I just want you to be careful, okay? Everything's going to be okay.|I'll see you later. I gotta go. - Bye.|- ...of this part of the Valley are to remain where they are. I don't know if you can see this,|but the police cars... are literally being|ripped apart by bullets. Bullets are going|clear through the cars. At least one LAPD officer|has been hit at this time. Henry. Henry! Hey. Nicole. I want you|to do me a favour. You got it, Henry.|Whatever you want, buddy. Why don't you go ahead|and pray for me. I already have. Then I know I'm gonna be all right. The 1 70's really|starting to back up as the LAPD have|closed the exits... at Burbank and Victory off the 1 70. Oh, what a mess. Command post, this is 43 David.|I need someone on tac-one right now. - Donnie, what's your E.T.A.?|- Frank, I'm about 1 0 minutes out. I'm gonna need someone|to walk me in here. This off-ramp's like|a parking lot. Confirmed. Multiple suspects,|body armour, AK's. It looks like our guys, Donnie. We train so we're ready. That way what we do,|it's automatic. We don't have to|think about it. It's second nature.|It just comes instinctively. No, I don't think they|have any intention of giving up. They've|seen our resources. Firing non stop. - Back inside!|- I can see they have gone back into the bank. Shit. There was a lot of them out there. - We got these.|- Yeah, right. They got nothing but their dicks|in their hands. Multiple officers and|civilians are lying wounded, some critically|in the streets. There's also an unconfirmed report|of another uniformed officer... that has been shot several times. - Rescue units are unable to help either of them.|- We can't wait for SWAT. - You're bleeding. You're bleeding.|- What? - Oh, that's a scratch. Are you all right?|- Yeah, I'm good. Four years earlier,|these two guys were arrested... in a routine vehicle stop. The sergeant of the Glendale PD|found an AK-47... and 1 ,200 rounds of ammunition|in their trunk. They went to jail for six months,|and, uh, walked out. And then the judge|gave them their guns back. Their attorneys said they needed|to sell them to pay their legal fees. Can you believe that shit? Harris.! Hey, Harris.! - Yeah, what?|- You're right in the line of fire. - Get your ass over here.|- Oh, you mean, back there by the gas tank? No, thanks. Moron. 1 5-L-1 0, requesting|a V-1 00 RA unit. Copy that.|V-1 00 rescue unit is on its way. All units, we are on a|citywide tac alert. All units on citywide tac alert|till further notice. 1 5-L-1 0, hold your positions.|They could be coming back out. I repeat, hold your positions. Henry. Henry! Hey, Henry.|Do you hear me? The RA's coming, Henry.|You hang in there. Henry, hey. Henry, you hear me?|Henry. - Get the hell outta here!|- Okay. Get that camera outta here!|You're gonna get yourself killed. Stay with me, buddy. - Stay with me, Henry.|- Officer needs assistance. Unit requesting help.|What is your location? 9-L-49. I need help. 9-L-49, hang in there. Help is on the way.|What is your location? 9-L-49, what is your location? 9-L-49.|9-L-49. 9-L-49?|9-L-49. - 9-L-49.|- Officer down. Officer down, code|three. He needs help. Code three. Hey! We gotta get that man outta|here fast. He's not gonna make it. - What do you have in mind?|- I'm gonna take this car. - Pull around. Wait for me.|- All right. Henry. Henry,|you hang in there. We're coming for you. You drive, I'll cover. Just create enough chaos,|and we're bound to slip through. Right. Right. Very little movement|down there right now. The suspects are|still inside presumably. Police have not begun to move in.|They're still behind their vehicles. You know, I just remember,|I got my Visa from this bank. No shit.|Hey, you make it out of this alive... you oughta ask them|to waive your balance. If we get separated,|I'll meet you at the safe house tonight. I'd rather die than go to jail|for the rest of my life. That's right.|We'll do it. We'll do it. - I'm not going to jail.|- I'm not going to jail. I'm not going to jail! Wait. Hold on. The gunmen--|- Coming out again! Hey! Come on! Come on! It looks like there's|a rescue mission underway. Despite the gunfire, two officers|have scrambled out of their car... and are pulling|another policeman to safety. This is unbelievable.|He's driving directly-- This is unbelievable.|He's driving directly-- I was at a point where it was--|was out of my hands. It wasn't in my control anymore. Literally, whether|I was going to live or die. And, uh, they say|that if you lose... over 50 or 60% of your blood,|well, that's it. And I think I lost|40% of my blood. I was scared and... I went back to a place where... I remember... chasing a suspect on foot. He fired at me,|and I went for cover. I guess, in some ways,|maybe I stayed too long. The suspect got away|and eventually turned up... robbed, uh, some folks|and killed somebody. And there's a part of you|that you know... maybe you didn't|do your best. And, uh, because you didn't do|your best that day, someone got hurt. I guess I knew that|on this day, I was gonna do... whatever I could do|to help my fellow officers... to make sure that this time,|the bad guys didn't get away. They didn't-- They didn't hurt anybody again.|They didn't kill again. Incredible. I gotta tell you. I am watching this and I still,|I can't believe it's happening. The money, Larry.|The money! Fifty cops outside. He turned around|and strolled right back in... without a care in the world,|like it was nothing. - What the hell's he doin'?|- Look at the duffel. Whoever put that dye pack in there|is gonna be dead. Man. Total disregard for life. The devastation is terrible... as the gunmen continue|to fire at the police officers as they try|to make their getaway. Dozens of officers and|civilians have been wounded, but reports|are telling us... - that ambulances are being held until the danger has been cleared. Absolute war zone down there.|The firing continues. ...keep the police|pinned down... although these brave officers|are refusing to back down. It looks like one of the gunmen|has reached into his car. Want some? Come on, pig! Continue to fire at him. 43-David. We are eastbound|in an alley heading toward Laurel. Should be there in two minutes. The policemen's return fire|doesn't seem to have any effect. The rounds just keep coming--|Whoa.! Wait. He's shootin' at us.|We're gonna have to get outta here. - Looks like he's taking shots right up there.|- Yeah. Get up! Get out of there!|Higher! - And are firing at will. It is complete chaos here. - Pratt.|- Yes, sir? Haul your ass around the corner|to B&B Guns... and grab as many|semiautomatic weapons as|you can find. Yes, sir. They're still shooting at us. Larry, get in the car.!|In the car.! Stick to the plan.|You drive, I cover. Kill the cops. ...just continue|to pummel the officers. ...just continue|to pummel the officers. - They fire-- It achieves|no effect at all.|- Officers, good morning. - I need guns. We got a situation.|- You're tellin' me. We need some assault rifles,|some semiautomatics. What've you got? We don't carry AKs, but, uh,|we got America's answer. It's the AR-1 5.|It'll get the job done. You got your CAR-1 5.|It's used by the U.S. military. If you really want|something special... that's the Remington 7 00,|bolt action. It's the best sniper rifle made. I can't believe they|let people just buy these. You got proper I.D., good credit,|wait 1 0 days for a background check-- We need all this.|All of them. - Okay. Hey, John, give me a hand.|- Okay. Here you go. - We need ammo.|- Okay, sir. - Get these guys some ammo.|- I'll get it. They're here. Command post, this is 43-David.|We are at the scene. Let's go. Yes, Jim, unconfirmed reports now|have a possible third... and maybe even a fourth suspect|in the bank. and maybe even a fourth suspect|in the bank. Jay, I want you to grab|that armoured car. - We're going to use that as our rescue vehicle.|- You got it. L.T., what's the position|of your suspects? We have two suspects|heading eastbound on Archwood. We have a report of a|possible third suspect inside the bank|holding hostages. - Shots have been fired.|- Okay, guys, we got an active shooter in the bank. We're gonna make an entry.|Let's go. - Who's gonna pay for all this?|- Charge it to Mayor Riordan. Suspects are leaving|the bank building. They continue to fire|into police officers. 8-L-1 0. Suspects are|attempting to go mobile. That's Archwood Street that|you see he's pulling out on. He's going|east on Archwood. Get out of the way! Police! Open up! Open up.! They're gone.|It's just us in here. - They're gone.|- Bank's clear. Stay in the vault! All right. Come on. 1 5-L-1 0, officer advised. You've got a clear shot|at the suspect... eastbound on Archwood,|from behind the supermarket. Larry! Get in the car! Get in the car! Come on! It's gotten strange.|They've slowed to an almost crawl... but the police seem helpless|to stop them. But now they're|moving a little quicker. They're|separating. I need officers on all four corners|on Archwood. I want you to extend that perimeter|four blocks in all directions. We've got a number two|suspect driving the white vehicle headed|east on Archwood. We've got number one suspect|on foot. Number one is behind a|long trailer rig. Whew! - Come on. Come on. Come on.| Come on! His gun is dropped.!|Go to the back side.! Hey, you kids.! Get back inside.!|I'm a policeman.! Go back in your house!|Get in there! Oh, my God.! One of the gunmen|has just been shot. He's down.! He's down. Officers are moving in.|He's not moving. Vehicle is moving very slowly.|He's trying to escape. Looks like he might be trying|to commandeer another car. Larry.! No.! I told you, get in the car! - I told you. There are cars coming|the other way. There is no police presence down|on Archwood, mind you. - This is a residential area.|- Looks like maybe he's|trying to force someone to stop, but cars are|going around him. I don't know if these people know|what's going on. They're very lucky. You can't go through.|You can't go through. Hey! Hey, pops!|Let me borrow your ride for 1 0 bucks? - No, no. I can't.|- Ten bucks. Look, look.|Here's 1 0 bucks for you. All right? All right? - Block the street, damn it! Okay, he's firing.|He just shot through his own window. The victim is running|down the street. He looks|like he's okay. Keys are here. Well, it looks like the gunman's|reached into his car. What, you want a piece of this? You think you're gonna get me?|I'm the man. I'm the man here. He's stopped.|Maybe he's stuck or something. - Come on. Come on! The guy who's got the initiative,|that's the guy who's calling the shots. That's the guy who decides|where and when it's gonna happen, how|it's gonna go down. And that can't be the bad guy.|That's gotta be you. - Oh, shit. Suspect! Just unbelievable.|Shots are firing everywhere. Looks like SWAT's on scene|and shooting from point-blank range. Watch your crossfire! - Malfunction!|- I got you covered! That way! Clear! Go! I'm out of ammo! Are you gonna hide down there? He's down. Okay, he's down. SWAT officers are moving in|and they're on him. - Stay down.! Do not move.! Hands! I wanna see hands! When I saw that black mask... I thought to myself,|''Here we go.'' But, you know, those are moments|when your training kicks in. Do you get scared? Yeah. You stay scared?|Better not. It looks like it's over.|I think this nightmare is finally over. Check the truck! Get down! - Hands!|- 1 5-L-1 0. Code four, guys.|Code four. It's all over. - Ah, shoot!|- All units in vicinity, all units... just be advised|code three is no longer. We generally are supposed|to have the firepower. They had the firepower that day.|We had the willpower. But you know what? I'll take the|willpower over the firepower any day. 308. Holes complete. Looks like a war zone. You're going to be okay, partner. When you|think about it, the kind of firepower we|were up against... that we were outgunned-- People talk about being lucky,|where you're lucky... that the bullet went in and out,|or you're lucky this. Well, my granddad said, ''Luck is|preparation meets opportunity.'' You've prepared and you get the|opportunity and then you can be lucky. And I was lucky.|A lot of us were lucky. We were lucky that that day,|when you think about it... the only two guys|that got killed... were the suspects,|were the bad guys. That wasn't a miracle.|That's a series of miracles. Come on. - Hey, there, look who I found. - Hey!|- You hanging in there? - Here, partner.|- Hey, thanks, Bobby. Aw, sir.| They got you good. Hey, I know a buddy in East LA|that can fix that air bag. Does this mean|we're closed tomorrow? No. It's funny how fast everything|returns to a state of normalcy. In fact, the very|next day, there was a line of customers|outside the bank... and one of the customers|was complaining how the bank didn't|open on time. Hey, life goes on, I guess. It's kind of weird,|the way it happened. The morale in the LAPD|was at an all-time low. The public was all over us... and then, all of a sudden,|out of nowhere, this happened. After that, even the media|were calling us heroes. Nobody becomes a cop because|they want to be loved. They become a cop|because they love the job. But every once in a while,|you get to put away some bad guys. And on that day,|in 44 minutes of... sheer terror... not a single officer ran away. And everybody did their job,|and I think that means something. And in 44 minutes|of sheer terror... there wasn't a single officer|that ran away. Not a single one. I think that means something. - That's our out. Good? - Very good.|- Great. I think we should|do that over there. On Friday, February 28, 1 997... the Los Angeles|Police Department... experienced a day of terror|and remarkable heroism. The North Hollywood bank shoot-out|will long be remembered... as one of the country's|most shocking displays of criminal|behaviour... and an outstanding example of|professional heroic law enforcement. Yesterday's true|heroes were the members of the Los Angeles|Police Department. One thing|agreed on was the bravery shown by the|police department. Police officers tell me|they're just overwhelmed by the amount of support|they've received. Now the officers are|standing by this community... doing their best to|support the community as they try to move|on with their lives. My dad works|in North Hollywood. Thanks. It's nothing short|of miraculous that no one was killed. In fact, what you're talking about here is--|It's multiple miracles. For actions above|and beyond the call of duty... seventeen LAPD officers|were honoured today... for their heroics during the 1 997|North Hollywood bank shoot-out. Yesterday's true heroes, of course... the Los Angeles police officers... without bullet-proof vests,|without the same firepower... courageously tracked|down and stopped the two heavily|armed gunmen. I'd like to personally|thank Commander Weller... and the North Hollywood police station. The heroic behaviour|of many officers yesterday... - has triggered an outpouring of support.|- Thank you for what you did. Some baked cakes.|Others brought flowers. Many sent cards, yet others-- Thank you for|what you did, all of you officers. We're 3 2 years|living in North Hollywood... and we really appreciate|everything that you've done.
