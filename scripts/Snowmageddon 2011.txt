I can absolutely do it myself. - I fly that route all the time. - ( doorbell chimes ) - ( dog barking) - No. Hey, can someone answer the door? ( Barking continues ) Mo. ( Squeals ) I can't believe it. Jennifer. - ( Scoffs ) What? - The door. ( Sighs ) I gotta go- My rodent of a brother isn't old enough to answer the door. I don't know who the kid is, but apparently he's a big deal. Jennifer can barely contain herself. -( Mo growls, barks ) - Mo! Jennifer: Rudy! I'm kinda busy up here! Rudy, a little help here! Calm down. It's okay, Mo. ( Continues growling and barking ) Jennifer: Mo. Hey, who is it? - ( Growls) - Mo, quit it. Rudy: It's a gift. Well, say thank you. It's heavy. Maybe it's my Dragon of the Crown expansion set. It's probably another fruitcake. -( Bells ringing) - ( townsfolk chattering ) Man: Hi, Sam! Woman: Such a beautiful tree. Man #2: Hey, Danny. Merry Christmas. Yeah, I'm so glad we got that. It was the last one there. - Are you okay with it? - Yeah, yeah, I'm good. And you have a merry Christmas. Thanks. - Fred. - John. I see you still haven't fixed the town clock. Well, what can I say? Time got away on me. Yeah, well. You and me both. You think we're gonna have a white Christmas? No snow. Weird, huh? Gifts are all packed up. Some of them still aren't wrapped yet, but... That's great. Beth'll be thrilled. Sure is nice that she commits to doing this every year. Well, I guess there are people who need a lot more than we do. We're lucky here, Fred. That we are. That we are. Hey, did that game come in that I ordered for Rudy'? I was kinda hoping he'd have it for a stocking stuffer. Dragon of the Crown expansion set. Still on back order, I'm afraid. I don't have high hopes of it being here for the holiday. If that's the worst problem I have in my house this Christmas, then I'm better off than most. You got that right. All right. My regards to the family. Yeah, will do. John: What about headwinds? What about flight range? I know it's a lot of weight to fly that far, but we can't let them down. It's tough over there. A lot of families are counting on the help. Yeah, I know, but, uh... Lawrenceville's a ways away. No, we got the room and, yes, the forecast looks fine. So quit worrying. ( Mo barking ) What's this? That's the one I was telling you about. Someone must have dropped it off this afternoon. - Beth: No name, no address. - John: Hmm. No name, no address. Honey, maybe it was for Lawrenceville. No, it's not marked for that, and all of those went to Fred's store. It's from Santa. Santa brings gifts down the chimney, stupid. - Hey. - I think we should open it. The two of you. Honestly. What do you think it is? I think maybe it's a set of golf clubs. - Mm. Mm-hmm. - Dad. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - ( chuckles) So, Mom... Yes? Do you think you're gonna need any help tomorrow with the helicopter and stuff? Yeah, I think I got it covered, honey. You said Tim wasn't going with you. Please, Mom. Come on. Oh, for crying out loud. Just open it. ( Mo barking ) What is wrong with that dog today? Wow. - That is cool. - Yeah. It's so gorgeous. - Boring. - No, no, no, no, come on. Look at the craftsmanship in this thing. John: There's Main Street. There's Town Hall. The clock on the tower's stuck on the same time as the real clock. ( Doorbell chimes ) - I'll get it. -( Mo barks ) ( turns gears ) John: Pizza's here! ( Groans ) ( ticking ) John: It looks like, uh... ( ticking grows louder) ( ticking continues ) - ( gears turning ) - ( clock begins ticking ) ( gasps ) ( townsfolk yelling ) Ah! Move! Everybody off the street! Move, move! Come on, let's go! Move! Move! ( Yells ) ( yells ) ( ticking echoing ) You feel that? Yeah, was that a tremor? ( Cell phone ringing ) (thunder crashing ) Yeah, hey, Tully. Yeah, we did. Yeah, I'll be right there. - Something happened downtown. - Okay. - I'll call you. - Yeah. (thunder rumbling ) No one come any closer. You don't want to be near this if there's another aftershock. Tully. John, over here. Wow. Yeah. - Any injuries? - I don't think so. We got lucky. All right, let's get those fires out. Cordon this off. I got some rope in my trunk. (woman screaming ) Oh, my God. I think that's Jacob. ( Barking ) ( ticking ) Beth: Rudy? What are you doing awake? I can't sleep. Sweetheart, I have a really early morning. Your dad's gonna be busy all day tomorrow. We all need our rest, okay? - Okay' - OK?!/' - Mo, come on. Come on, boy. -( Mo growling) -( barks ) - Beth: Come on. I love you. Love you, too. (ticking, whirring ) ( bell tolls) Rudy's still in bed, lazy bum. Yeah, he was up past midnight. We'll let him sleep. Mary'll be by to look after him. So much for good weather. ( Birds chirping ) It'll be fine. I do this a dozen times a year. Yeah, I guess you should go. The kids in Lawrenceville would be disappointed if you didn't show up. And I'm gonna let Jacob's brother know. What about Jacob? Wow, look at you helping. ( Scoffs ) Can't a daughterjust help her mother once in a while? Mom, I'm begging you. It's Derrick Reed. He's a client. I'll be good. I promise. And besides, I can help with dropping off the gifts afterwards. - Please? - Who's Derrick Reed? Only the best snowboarder ever. John: Ah, wow. - Best ever, Beth. - Mm. Where I am going is very remote. And I have a very strict schedule. Well, without Tim, you are solo. Right? ( John chuckles ) ( sighs ) Get your coat. ( Screams ) Thanks. - I love you. - Uh-huh. Hey, how about a little love over here? I'm the one who made it happen. Hey, listen. Uh... that gift you got your brother. That was nice of you. Did Fred make that? Dad, I didn't get that gift. But if you want, I'll take the credit. All right. - You be safe. - You be safe. Mistletoe. Wait. - No mistletoe. - Ew, gross. - I love you. - See you soon. Get in the car. ( Engine starts ) ( Mo barks ) Hey, Champ. Hey, how you doing, buddy? Hey, Dad? Did the ground break last night? Yeah, I guess you could say that. - Hey, Rudy. Hey, Mr. M. - Rudy: Hey, Mary. Hi, Mary. Thanks for the last-minute help. Dad, I wanna see where the ground broke. It's too dangerous right now, buddy. How'd you know the ground broke, anyway, Mr. Big Ears? I-I saw it in the snow globe. In the snow globe? - Really? - Yeah. I'll have to check that out when I get back. Bye, Mr. M. Hey, no sneaking a look at the gifts under the tree. - ( Mo barks ) - ( chuckles ) Bye, Dad. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into. Aren't they supposed to be here by now? Yeah. Listen, I know you're excited. When they get here, I want you to be extremely professional. What's that supposed to mean? No ogling, no drooling. Mom, really? -( Horn honking ) - They're here. ( Music playing from car) ( groans ) ( door slams ) Ho ho ho. - Are you Beth? - Yeah. - Hey, I'm Derrick Reed. - Pleasure. - Hey, I'm Greg. - Hi, hello. Good to meet you. This is, uh, this is my assistant Jennifer. Oh, hi, Jennifer. Happy holidays. Happy holidays, indeed. So are you guys looking for anything in particular? Oh, you know. Just some choice powder. - A good incline. - Yeah, you know the mountain - better than we do. - All right. Let's get you guys loaded up and stop wasting daylight. - Cool. - Yeah. Okay. - Okay. - Do you need help - with your stuff? - Uh, yeah. That would be great-- Actually, I need you to do a final rundown on the engine. Hey, no sweat. Yeah, we can handle it. What? I wasn't ogling. No, you were flirting, which is way worse than ogling. What did I say? All right, dude. Let's do this. Tully. HEY - Coffee fresh? - Fresh, yes. Good? That's another story. Filled in most of the smaller ones. Roped off the larger one for now. ( Sighs ) So, where are we at with damage? Well, the gas mains are intact. Which is surprising, considering the flames everyone mentioned. Maybe a natural gas pocket. What about Grainer and Lawrenceville? Yeah, nothing. They didn't even know we had a tremor. - Even in Grainer? - Yeah. As far as anyone outside of town knows, that earthquake never even happened. - That's impossible. - I know. It's strange, huh? - ( Sighs ) -( hammer pounding ) Come on. Let's get this cleaned up. All right. Hey, did the rotor heads check out? The what? You don't know anything about helicopters, do you? No. She's your mom, isn't she? Hey, you want me to sign something? Yeah? Here. Right there? It's nice, honey. - Come on, man. Put that away. - What are you talking about? - This is what we came here for. - All right, man. - Good? - Yeah. What's up, boys and girls? We're fresh out of reindeer, but Santa's always got his sleigh. - ( Camera beeps ) - Good? - That's fantastic. - All right, dude. Let's do this. Derrick: Whoo-hoo! ( Echoing faintly ) Awesome! ( Barking ) Mo. ( Mo continues barking ) ( growling ) Stop it. Mo! - Mary: Rudy? -( Mo growling) ( Mo barking, whining ) What's going on out here? Mo made me push one of the buttons. All right, well, you can play with that later. - Your snack's ready. - But I'm-- Come on. Soup's getting cold. Let's go. ( Mo growling ) Mary: Come on. ( Ticking ) (thunder crashing ) I don't think there's anything Santa can bring you that will top that. This is the best Christmas ever. - What was that? - Just a little wind. We're okay. Okay, that is a hell of a storm front. We will turn right around. Mom! What the hell? ( Speaker feedback ) J' Joy to the world J' J' The Lord is come... J' Come on, Larry. Is that really necessary? Hey, it's Christmas Eve, John. We've always had carols. It's tradition. Now's not the time. Hey, I feel terrible about what happened to Jacob, but you know how much he loved this time of year. I wouldn't get between this man and his decorations if I were you, John. I think this town should just carry on in the Christmas spirit. ( Gears turning ) ( clock ticking ) Hey, Fred. - You fixed it! - Fixed what? The clock. You got it going. Impossible. I haven't touched it. Well, it's working now. No, you don't understand. I took the guts out years ago. They're in my shop. It can't work. (thunder crashing ) Whoa. What the hell is that? Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is Alaska Charter November-101. We are in a serious storm system at the bottom of Mount Thalberg. ( Screams ) Jenn, I need your help. - What? - I need you-- I need you to find me a frequency. You need to get a message out. Honey, go through each frequency. Mayday, Mayday. Can anyone hear us? - This is Jennifer Miller. - ( Ice explodes ) - ( static hissing ) - Mom! You ever seen anything like that before? -( Radio chattering ) - No. ( Over radio ) Mayday, this is Jennifer Miller. - Mayday, Mayday! - Jennifer, come in! - ( Static hissing ) - Jenny, can you hear me? Come in! Go, go, go. I got this. Ho ho ho. ( laughs ) - ( camera beeps ) - That good? - That was great. Perfect, man. - Good, man. - Awesome. - ( thunder rumbles) - Uh, Derrick? - What? What the hell is-- ( gasps ) Greg! Ahh! Derrick: Greg! You okay? Come on, get up. Get up. You all right? Look at me. I don't know, man. Something hit me. - ( Thunder rumbles) - What? (yelling ) You Okay? - Eh? - I think I'm okay. Look out! Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go! Grab your board, Greg. Grab your board! Let's go! - Mom! - I got it. Mom, get us out of here! Mom! Jenn! - Brace yourself! - ( screams ) Whoa! Ahh! ( Yells ) Everyone inside! - Into the basement! - Everyone inside, now! Come on! Tully: Let's go! Come on, come on! ( Groans ) Whoa. Everyone in the cells now! Move! Norm! Norm, what are you doing? You're gonna get yourself killed. Get in here. (woman screams ) ( yelling, screaming ) (thunder crashing ) ( groans ) ( loud crash ) ( static hisses ) Alaska Charter November-101, come in. ( Static continues ) Beth, can you hear me? ( Static continues ) ( engine starts ) ( electricity buzzing ) You all right? ( Groaning ) Help! Someone help! We're stuck! Fred! Fred. Fred. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? Oh! Those cables are still live. Larry, don't move. The tires are the only thing that are keeping the bus from being grounded. What the hell does that mean? He's saying unless you wanna get lit up like a Christmas tree, - stop trying to get off. - Is he serious? Easy, Tully. You're scaring him. - Shut up, Norm. - Deep breaths, Larry. Norm: Relax there, big fella. Look, I'll take care of this. You help the others. Don't move. ( Groans ) I know you don't need Tully to be scared. You listen here, jackass-- Oh, no. Hey, hey. Okay, sorry, buddy. Just take it easy. I'll get some help. - Tully! - Yeah? You st-- stay there. Stay there. Norm's hurt real bad. Okay, just stay calm. I'll get you something for Norm. That's right. They're coming, buddy. Just hang on. Hang on, buddy. They're coming for us. Should I put your feet up? Let's just-- just breathe. Just breathe. Just like that, it's over. Did you talk to my dad yet? I haven't yet, but don't worry. Hey... I'm sure your mom cancelled her flight. She's probably on her way home right now. So, which one of these am I supposed to be again? You're one of the Knights of Omnia. You've been quested to take the Dragon Crown and throw it into the volcano. Is that-- is that this thing right here? - This thing? - Don't touch it! Every time you touch it in the game, - you lose two life points. - I do? - It's cursed. - Oh. - Now, come on. - Okay, so, uh... throw the crown into the volcano. Got it. What else? Are you coming? Yeah. So, it's your turn. - Roll the dice. - Yeah. Jenn? Jenn? Jenn! ( Gasps ) Beth: Jennifer, can you hear me? Jennifer! Mom? Mom! ( Screams ) - Mom, I'm stuck! - Hey, don't move! Mm, help! It's okay, sweetheart. I'm coming to get you. Honey, stay still. Okay, what've we got? I'm stuck. I can't get out. ( Creaking ) - Mom, I have to-- - Okay, stay calm. I'm gonna be right back. I'm gonna cut you out, okay? Greg? Greg! Greg: Over here. ( groans ) Hang on, buddy. I'm messed up, man. I can see that. Hey, hey, look at me. Look at me. Don't worry. Okay, I'm gonna fix you up and get you out of here. - Lean forward for me - Okay. Just a little bit, if you can. - You all right? - Yeah, man. It's all right. ( Groaning ) Let me get you out of that, buddy. Hang on. ( Electricity zapping ) What kind of man puts this much work into decorating a bus? It's Christmas. It's a special time. And plus, people like it. It's just strange. That's all I'm saying. Well... Tully: Larry! Okay, you sit tight. I'll be right back, Scrooge. Here you go. Here. Catch. Look, can you get him through the window? If you don't touch the bus and the ground at the same time, I think you can jump free. Norm's not exactly in the jumping shape. All right, all right. Just sit tight. I'm gonna try and cut the power lines, okay? Hey, Tully, Tully. You know about electricity, right? I guess we're gonna find out. He's not one for pep talks, is he? -( Norm groans ) - Hang on, buddy. Okay, I got some stuff here. Hang on. You're gonna be fine. You just hang on. They're getting us out. You just-- this might hurt a little bit. Ready? Yeah. Put pressure on that. Hang on. Jennifer: Mom, what are you doing? Trying to find something to cut you out. Mom, I'm--I'm--I'm cold. You gotta stay calm, baby! - Mom, hurry! - I'm coming! We're gonna get you warm. We're gonna get you outta there. Yes. Please. Okay, here. Here. ( Metal creaking ) Come on, Mom. - ( Groaning ) - Mom, Mom, Mom! No! ( Screaming ) - Mom! - Jenn! Jenn! - Mom! - I'm coming, baby! Okay, here. Beth: We are almost there. Jennifer: What-- what's going on in there? - Beth: Fuel line's split. - What? We're getting you out of here. Come on, come on. No! Come on, come on! Let's go! Dude, just board down, get help, and come back for me. No, there's no way I'm leaving you up here alone. - Okay, that's ready. - Yeah. Okay, that's good. I want you to use these. Dig 'em in like that. Nice and deep. - Got that? - Yeah. Okay. Dude, you better not let me go. You'd better be nice to me, then. - Okay, you ready? - Yeah. Here we go. Nice and easy. Nice and slow! - Keep digging that in! - Greg: Yeah! All right. Yeah. You're gonna have to go. ' ( Groans ) - Honey? I-I think I need to lie down. No, no, no. You gotta keep moving, okay? We gotta keep the core temperature up. - Sit up for me. - I can't. Sit up at least. Sit up, baby. You gonna make me carry you? Huh? You gonna make me carry you? ( Metal squealing in distance ) What is that? (engine roars) What was that? Mom, what was that? Over here! Jennifer: Help! Over here! Stop! Dad? ' Dad! - Hey! - We're here, Dad! - Hey! Beth: Hey! John: Oh! You made it! Oh, my God. - Derrick: You okay, Greg? - Yeah! - Greg: Okay! - Qkay, set? Yeah, set! You Okay? Yeah. How you holding up? Slow and steady, right? All right. Here we go again. - You good? - Yeah. Now listen. We're gonna go right past that crash site. Dude, man. I hope they're okay. I'm not sure we've got any extra room on this board to share. You ready? Okay, let's go. Nice and easy. ( Greg groaning ) Okay. Okay. All right. Okay, Tully. This shouldn't be too hard. Whoa. Okay, uh... that didn't work. Uh... plan B. Did Tully get the power off? I don't know. Oh, go stick a toe on the ground. I'm sure the shock won't be that bad. I'm sure you'd like that, eh? ( Chuckles ) Hey. Stick with me, Norm. Norm. Norm, stick with me, buddy. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. I'm sure-- I'm sure Tully knows what he's doing. Okay, uh... Whew. Here goes nothing. Come on! ( Groans ) Mayday, Mayday. Search and Rescue, come in. ( Static hissing ) Can anyone hear me? We got a chopper down on Mount Thalberg. Two males missing. If anyone's out there, come in. ( Static hissing ) We're gonna be all right. Mayday, mayday! Still no one. Beth? Jennifer? I don't like the looks of this, man. We gotta get you moving now. ( Groans ) ( growls ) HEY Whatcha doing? I don't want it any more. What? Why not? Oh, wow. This is our town. - It makes bad things happen. - What? Bad things that happen in there happen out here. And let me guess. If I touch it, I lose two life points, right? I'm serious. Mo doesn't like it either. ( Scoffs ) Mo doesn't like anything - that isn't food. -( Mo barks ) What do these buttons on the back do? Don't press any. It's cursed. Rudy, I didn't. It's okay, see? ( Gears turning ) ( barking ) You pressed a button. Now a set of gears are turning. I-I didn't. I-I swear. - It happened on its own. -( Mo barking ) The buttons on the globe, they make bad things happen. Okay, Rudy. You're starting to freak me out here. ' Mo! ' Mo! Stay here. I think I left the door open. ( Ticking gets louder) ( bell ringing ) What was that? What do you see? - ( Ground rumbling) - Oh, no. What is that? Avalanche! (yelling ) Oh, my God. Dad? It's an avalanche! - Jennifer! - Dad! Come on! Faster! - John: Come on! - Beth: Jenn, brace yourself! ( Screams ) What the hell's taking him so long? Hey, do you smell gas? Come on, Norman. - We're getting out of here. - What are you doing? We gotta go. Come on. - Let's go. - ( yells, moans ) Okay, okay. All right, easy. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Don't worry. Don't patronize me. What's happening? All right, look. If we can smell gas in here this strongly, it means there's gotta be a lot of it on the ground, so we gotta-- Okay, just sit right there. Hang on. ( Groans ) Whew. - Whoa. - Tully! Fred! You gotta cowboy up, Norm. We're leaving. - Did they get the power off? - I don't know, - but we're leaving. - Wait. - ( Groaning ) - Norm: Larry. Larry! Larry, don't! Larry! Larry, what are you doing? The power's not off. - Wait! - ( electricity buzzes ) ' ( Qrunts ) ' No! - Ah! - Whoa! He's dead. Oh, no. Norm. Larry, Norm! John: You guys all right? Yeah, I think so. Jenn, you okay? - John: Jenny? - No! We're buried alive. Stay calm. ( Radio static ) Tully, can you hear me? Can anyone hear me? If anyone's out there, come back. ( Static hissing ) We need to get out of here. Yeah. I know. I just don't want to send us farther down the mountain. Okay. - Hold on. - Yeah. - You ready? - Beth: Yeah. - ( Engine roars ) - Here we go. Come on! Come on! Please, please, please. ( Engine straining ) ( John growls ) Damn it. (engine dies) We can't move. Rudy... Rudy, I couldn't find Mo and the lines are out. But we should probably just head over to the neighbors' and look for him. Rudy? Rudy? Rudy! Rudy! You've got to be kidding me. That was no normal storm. I was thinking the same thing. -( Metal creaking ) - Dad? These windows aren't gonna hold. - Derrick: Hello? - Did you hear that? - Derrick: Anyone? - Jenn: It sounds like Derrick. Derrick: Jenn! I need to get you out. Hold on, guys. - Derrick! - Derrick! ( Groans ) I'm gonna get you out! Hold on! Derrick! Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! Come on. It's not much further. (grunts) Keep g0il19- Tully: This is Tully in the Town Hall of Normal, Alaska. - Here. - If you're receiving this, - Thanks. - please acknowledge. Over. ( Radio static ) You reach him? Nobody. Not John, not anybody. The radio's working fine. It's like... nobody can even hear us. How is that possible? I have no idea. Emergency teams should have been here hours ago. It's like-- it's like the whole town just dropped off the map. So what are you gonna do? I'm hoping I wake up ( scoffs ) I'll get more supplies. This is Tully in the Town Hall of Normal, Alaska. If you're receiving this, please acknowledge. Over. ( Static hissing ) I'm worried about Rudy. Mary's a smart girl. I'm sure Rudy'll be fine. Come on. We're almost there. - Derrick: You okay? - Jennifer: Yeah. Jennifer: You okay? Yeah. I'll live. I'm sorry about your friend. Yeah, me, too. John: Okay, let's keep moving, guys. Come on. Let's go. Tully on radio: Mayday, Mayday. This is Tully in the town of Normal, Alaska. Is there anybody out there? Please respond. Mayday, mayday- If you're receiving this, please acknowledge. If anyone is out there, please acknowledge. Over. Tully on radio: If you're receiving this, - please acknowledge. - ( static hissing ) - Tully. - John. Oh, thank God. Jennifer and Beth okay? They're both a bit banged up. John: We've got a casualty on the mountain. Look, we need you in town. Tully: How quickly can you get here? We gotta check on Rudy and then I'll be there. Okay. Hurl'Y- Okay. Just sit tight, okay? Okay. Sit tight. Sitting tight. Rudy! Rudy! Hey' hey! Stop! Stop the-- stop! Stop! John: Mary, what are you doing out here? Oh, thank God. I have been going - out of my mind. - Where's Rudy? - Where's Rudy? - He's gone. What do you mean "gone"? I've searched for him everywhere I can possibly think, - but I can't find him. - Okay, okay. Calm down. Just tell us what happened. Mo ran away and I went to look for him for, like, two seconds. And then when I came back, Rudy was just gone. And he left me this note. "It's all my fault." What was? - What was all his fault? - I don't know. He was talking about his snow globe. I tried to tell him it was all nonsense, but he wouldn't listen. - He's alone out there. - He can't have gone far. Come on. - We should split up. - No way. We are sticking together. No, you guys keep going that way. I'm gonna head over to Maple Road. He's got a little hideout over there. Makes sense. You know it does. Yeah, I'll go with her. Okay, you're with me. Whatever happens, - meet back at Town Hall. - I'm coming, too. Mary, you should go back to your family. No, I'm going. This is my fault. I'm gonna help find him. Why is he blaming himself? What does any of this have to do with him? He's got a very active imagination. What was Mary saying about the snow globe? This morning, Rudy said there was a crack in the globe. Just like there was in town. You think he imagined that? I don't know. It sounds crazy. But he was right. I mean, he had to know somehow. God, I hope he's okay. Rudy! Jennifer: Rudy! So this hideout that your brother's got. What is it? It used to be an old mine access. But if you ask Rudy, it's his magic fortress. You know, from that silly Dragon of the Crown. Oh, what are you talking about? That game rocks. - Are you serious? - Hell, yeah. Throw the crown in the volcano. Kill the dragon. I grew up on that game. I guess my little bro isn't as much of a dork after all. Rudy! Rudy! Derrick... are you okay? You know that Greg was the closest thing I had to a brother? I mean, what's going on? How could any of this be happening? (sighs) You saved our entire family today, Derrick. I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for you. No one would have been on that mountain if it weren't for me. No, if it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't have ever gotten off that mountain. You saved us. (sniffs ) Now help me find my brother. Okay. Rudy. Are you okay? - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for you. Okay. What can I do for you? Did-- did you make this? No. - Jeez, where'd you get this? - It came as a secret gift. My dad thought you made it. Me? First I've seen it. It's exquisite. Everything that happens inside here happens for real. - Is that right? - You don't believe me? No, no. It's just that-- ( ticking ) Well, that just-- That just can't be. Rudy! - I know you're here! - Rudy! Rudy! - Derrick: Rudy? - Rudy! Rudy! Let's get a closer look. Jennifer: Rudy! Jennifer: Rudy! Rudy! I don't think he's here, Jennifer. Tell you what, we'll hang out for a bit. Maybe he'll show up. Okay. Rudy: It's like the Dragon of the Crown. The crown, it's cursed. So you think this snow globe is cursed. Or maybe the globe cursed the town. Yeah. And it's my fault because I opened the present. Oh, Rudy. There are a lot of myths about cursed objects. Sometimes the curse is a punishment. Sometimes the curse is a test. But, I mean... even if this is a curse, it's not your fault. ( Sighs ) So you do believe me? Well, there's certainly a lot of things here I can't explain. But the idea that this globe is somehow destroying our town is just... I mean, there's no markings, there's no serial number. There's certainly no "Made in China." I don't know about a curse, but this is certainly the strangest thing that I have ever seen. ( Static hissing ) Mayday, Mayday. If anyone can hear this, - please respond. - ( static resumes ) If somebody heard you, they'd be here by now. Larry, I'm-- I'm trying my best here. Look, Tully... whatever's going on is gonna drag this town straight to hell before it's done. Okay, Larry. You're scaring the people. - Just-- - We gotta get outta here now. I understand that, Larry. But we can't really leave right now until we get some assistance. Now everybody-- John. You've got a hell of a mess on your hands here. - You can say that again. - Rudy's gone. He ran away. - Has anyone seen him? - Have you talked to Fred? Last time I saw him, he said he was getting supplies - at his shop. - You okay, Larry? I've had better days, John. Just calm down, everybody. All right? We can't just sit around and wait. No help is coming. ' Rudy? Hey. - Mom! We were worried about you, buddy. You scared us. Oh, thank you, Fred. Yeah. Would you tell me where you got this? I thought it was you. It was left at our door. Why? Hell of a thing. ( Beeping ) Anybody answering? Phones are still dead. - What is that? - Found it inside. Official Dragon of the Crown issue. Face the dragon without this bad boy, you can forget about it. Of course. HEY It's gonna be fine. Rudy? - Rudy! - Rudy! ( Clock ticking ) It didn't look anything like that the last time I saw it. Rudy's right. I can't quite believe I'm saying this, but somehow, what's happening in there is happening out here. It's not possible. Neither are about half the things we've seen in town today. - You got that right. - Tully: John. Townsfolk are getting antsy and they're looking for answers. - Please tell me you got some. - John... I think you should hear - what your son has to tell you. - I'm worried about Jenn. Yeah, she should've been here by now. You stay here with Rudy, I'll go look for her. It'll be a nice change from Town Hall. Tell us, Rudy. What happened? ( Ticking continues ) A toy? A kid's toy is what we're talking about? This is no ordinary toy. Just listen to what we have to say, Larry. No, you listen up, John. We got a lot of dead friends and family. Town's coming apart at the seams. What does a damn snow globe have to do with anything? Everything. Look, we've all known each other for a long time. You just have to trust me when I tell you. Everything that's happened in this town - can be traced back to this. - It's true. - Ridiculous. - It's true. Now, ever since this thing was placed at our doorstep, we've had one disaster after another. Every time one of these buttons is pressed, another disaster hits. And who told you that? My son. ( laughing, groaning ) Look, if pressing buttons causes disasters, then don't push any damn buttons. It's not that simple. Have you looked at the town clock today? It's ticking. Yeah, well, clocks will do that, John. Fred: Not this one. You all know. I took that thing apart years ago. There are no gears inside that clock. And yet there it is, ticking away. And it's got the exact same time on it as the clock inside this globe. That's got to mean something. I think it's a countdown. Countdown? A countdown to what? I'm guessing at the top of the hour, another disaster's gonna strike whether we push a button or not. Yeah, and maybe Santa and his reindeers will come down from the sky. It's all hogwash. ( laughter) Look out. I got it. Go on. - No, Larry-- - ( yells ) - ( snow globe rolls on floor) -( board drops ) Didn't even leave a mark. - Here. - Larry, Larry! No, Larry! Come here. I need to talk to you. Mom, you believe me, don't you? Put down that sandwich for a second. I believe that that snow globe somehow has something to do with everything that's happening. And I believe that your dad will do anything to keep us safe. But I don't believe for a second that any of this is your fault. Getting everyone all excited doesn't help anything, Larry. You said that thing just showed up on your doorstep, right? Yeah, that's right. Just showed up on my doorstep. No address, no shipping info. Yeah, then it's your responsibility. - You're doing this to us. - Come on, Larry. You see what's happening in our town. It's our problem. We're all in this together. - No, he's right. - What? Okay, hang on here. Larry: Let's just say that I'm wrong. What are we gonna do? 'Cause if you're right, any minute now, another disaster's gonna hit us. Well, let's just hope I'm wrong. ( Ticking ) ( bell rings) Rudy! Rudy! ( Loud bang ) Did you hear that? What, is there something back there? Rudy? -( Rocks shaking ) - Rudy! ( Screams ) ( glass clinking faintly ) - You okay? - Yeah. (woman screams ) - Was that a scream? - What? ( Jennifer screams ) Jennifer! Let's gqg Go' go! gas (yelling ) - Derrick! - ( gurgling ) Derrick! No. Help! Somebody help me! Somebody help, please! Please. That thing's from hell itself. - Stay calm, Larry. - You stay calm, Fred. Guys, everything seems to be fine. Still no sign of Jenn. Okay. Look, it came to my house. My family. It's my responsibility. So what are you gonna do with it? I don't know. I'm open to all suggestions. Take it someplace else. Another town, if you can. I can't do that. That's not the answer. Throw it into the volcano. What's that, son? In the Dragon of the Crown, the crown that cursed the village needs to be tossed into the volcano. Wait a minute. That's not crazy. Oh, come on. That game is based on an old Greek myth about Hephaestus and Pandora. The gift is just like Pandora's box. Opened up and all the evils of the world are let loose to wreak havoc. But there's one thing left in the box. What's that got to do with the volcano? Hephaestus made the gift in the bowels of a volcano. The gift must be returned there to destroy it. Oh, come on. Fred, what was the one thing left in the box? - Hope. - Fred: That's right. Hope. Come on, Larry. It isn't any crazier than the things we've seen in town today. I know. Well, show me a volcano, then. You dimwit. We've already got one. - Mount Thalberg. - That's right. Thalberg's becoming active again. She's getting ready to blow. That's not a volcano. Well, it hasn't been active for thousands of years, - but it is a volcano. - What? Look, you all said it. This is my responsibility. This is what I'm doing. The rest of you have to get everyone out of town. You can't stay here any more. See, that's the first thing I've heard that makes sense. So what about you? I'm going back up the mountain. You coming with us or not, Fred? I'm staying. This town is all I've known, and I trust John to save it. You know it's gonna take a miracle to get out of this. - Wouldn't that be something? - What? I can't think of a better time of year for a miracle. You're crazier than the rest of them. ( Door opens, closes ) All right, just take some of this. John. Honey, I'm gonna find Jenn. I'm gonna take care of the globe. Then I'm gonna come find you. What the-- No! Help! - ( Screams ) Help! - ( concrete cracking ) Come on. Come on. Not again! No! Come on. Stay on it. No! ( Larry screams ) No! No. ( Horn blaring ) John, wait. I'm coming with you. I said this was my responsibility, Tully. Your resp-- this is our town, our responsibility. We need you down here, Tully. The town needs you. My family needs you. Jenny! Oh, my God. Beth, it's Jenn. - Beth! - Beth: Oh, my God. Jenn? Jenn. What happened? What happened? Are you okay? Sweetheart, where's Derrick? I love you so much, baby. Stay here and take care of your brother. What? Where are you going? I'm gonna go put an end to this. John, wait. My snowmobile. Side of the cabin. ( Rumbling ) Do you hear that? She's waking up. - Take care of my family, Tully. - You got it. Dad. Every hero needs a talisman. My talisman. Look at me. You're my hero. Dad. I love you. Go and take care of your mother. (wind whistling ) ( loud explosions ) ( revving engine ) ( groaning ) You all right? ( Car door slams ) ( engines starting ) You guys okay? Yeah, we're okay. Rudy: What about Fred? Fred's not coming just yet, but he's gonna let us use his car. Isn't that nice of him? -( Horns honking ) - Yeah, I guess so. Cowboy's ready. We'd better get out of here. ( Horn honks ) ( bell ringing ) Oh, blow it out your-- ( ground breaking ) ( gasping ) ( ground continues breaking ) Stay here. - Unbelievable. - Whoa, hey. South road! - What do you think? - Let's go, Beth. South road! It's all part of the curse. - There's no curse, Rudy. - Yes, there is. And Dad's gonna break it. Enough. We are not trapped. We are not giving up. We're gonna make it and Dad is, too, okay? Fred: Hurry up! Hurry! Fred: Come on, hurry up! Come on. Go. go! ( Screams ) - We're trapped. - Not yet we're not. ( Explosion ) (yelling ) -( loud crash ) - Oomph! - Where are you going? - To try and find a way out of here. (yelling ) Whoa. Now we're trapped. ( Groaning ) ( coughs ) ( ticking ) ( groans ) Okay. Let's go. ( Engine rumbles, roars ) Come on, 9! Come on, come on, come on! Keep going, come on! Yeah ! Come on, baby! Come on! You can do it, yeah! Yeah, whoo! You did it, you old bag of bones! Oh... Whoa. Come on. Come on! John: Oh... Come on, 9! Come on! Go! - Why is this happening to us? - ( explosions continue ) Why did we end up with the stupid snow globe? Maybe it ended up where it needs to be. What do you mean, little man? Every story needs a hero. Need a hook. That'll work. Way to go, Rudy. Come on. ' ( explosion ) - ( grunts ) I guess I'm gonna have to do this the hard way. - ( Ticking ) - ( explosions continue ) Oh. Hang on to your hats. This is really gonna be something. (grunts) Whoa. ( Groaning ) (yelling ) ( grunting ) Okay. Merry Christmas, you son of a bitch. Something's happening. ( Clock gears screech ) More like something isn't happening. Oh, wow. Way to go, John. Well, I'll be damned. An honest-to-goodness Christmas miracle. Beth: Come here. They're inside. Jennifer's trying to get Rudy to nap. But somehow I don't see that happening. Some incredible kids you got there. Yeah. They really are. Still no sign of him? No. Dad'll be back. - I know it. - Of course. ( Mo barking ) Mo! Mom! Mo! I was worried about you, boy. Rudy: You're okay. Oh, look who's here. Look who's here. ( laughs ) John: Beth. - Beth. - Oh, my God. - Jenn? - Dad! Oh! Dad! - You okay? - Yeah. You did it. Just like in the stories. Nice work, John. Fred. Hell of a Christmas, hey, John? Just another Christmas in Normal. Come on inside. I got some eggnog- That sounds about right. Mo's already ready. ( Gasps ) ( ticking ) ( music playing )
