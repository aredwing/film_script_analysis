I'll take that specie. We're short of cash at the diggings. What time do you open in the morning? Tomorrow's Sunday. Then put the specie in the saddle bags and I'll come by for it before you close tonight. You must have around 7,000 here. That's no trinket to be left lying loose around a hotel room. Gold is only yellow gravel, Cornelius. Yes, but the yellow color makes all the difference. Butter's yellow, too, and you can spread it on bread. Ever try that with gold? For a business man, you've got odd ideas. If I were a banker, as I shall be some day, I'd set you down as unsound and lend you nothing. A man can choose his own gods, Cornelius. What are your gods? What? Damp day. Let me see that. Yes, sir. It's a beautiful little locket. It came from England. I'll take it. A fortunate young lady, whoever she is. Anything else, sir? Yes, I need some dry clothes, shirt, socks, everything from the skin out. Hey, Logan! Come here. How are you, McLane? Fine. Just the man I want to see. What are the Indians doing down your way this year? So far, quiet and uncertain. Whiskey? Whiskey. Whiskey. Logan, I've got a consignment of general hardware from the brig Alice to be delivered to Clay & King at Jacksonville. It's cloth, rope, tin dishes, buckets. I'm shipping by boat to Salem. Do you want to pack it from there? How many mules will it make? Oh, 20, I suppose. What's your freight? Three dollars a mule per day. Agreeable. It'll be in Salem on the 20th. Two more of the same. Not for me. I've got to see if I can get a load of windows hauled out to Gales Creek. Windows? Windows with glass? We're becoming civilized. Oh, Bob. Bob Miller. Lumber's selling sky-high in San Francisco. You sure enough will make a handsome profit, Captain. Miss Lucy Overmire arrived? In Room 10. Just off the Cascades boat. Thanks. She's been asking for George Camrose. We got through all right. But the train back of us, 50 wagons, not a one of them left. Come in, George. Why, Logan! Hello, Lucy. Oh, George had to make a sudden trip to Crescent City. He knew I was coming up, so he asked me if I'd bring you home. Will you mind having me on your hands, Logan? That was a foolish question. You don't mind having women on your hands. Where did you get that? Rumor. George Camrose, I bet. Oh, have you got stout clothes? I want to get started before daylight and the weather's foul. I don't mind. How was your visit up at The Dalles? Quiet. Oh, Logan, there were a lot of cattle abandoned by the emigrants. You could probably get them for very little. Did you see any mules? No. Well, five o'clock then, and dress warm. We'll make Salem the first day and Toms River the second. We should be in Jacksonville Friday afternoon, unless that's traveling too fast for you. No. I suppose you're going down to play a little poker now. I guess not. Good night. A woman, Logan? I kept open for you. Thanks. I was just reading in the Advertiser they've completed a suspension bridge across Niagara Falls for the railroad. Well, that's progress. Out our way, we haven't even got a stagecoach yet. Well, you've got to have the roads first. Maybe it's the other way around. Get the stagecoaches and there'll be plenty of roads. Well, from a banking viewpoint, I'd want to be sure there were roads there first! What's that? I said, from a banking viewpoint, I'd... Oh, poohdaddle! Come in, Logan. You see, it wasn't a woman. Why didn't you say so then? You're marrying George, not me. What have you got in the saddle bags? Gold coin. You know, I was watching you from the window. There was a man standing at the corner of Alder as you passed and he followed you. Don't worry about it. Good night, Lucy. Good night. Logan! What happened? A bad try. He got away. Who was it? I have an idea it was Bragg. He had an arm like a chunk of oak. You're hurt! I'm all right. Lucy, you better get out of here. Go on to bed and get some sleep. We're leaving at five sharp. What makes you so sure it was Bragg up in Portland? He might have trailed me. He's had me on his mind for quite awhile, ever since those two miners were killed over at Evans' Ferry. The ones the Indians murdered? Indians? I was out on the road that morning and I saw Bragg come out of the willows running his horse. A few minutes later, I stumbled onto the two bodies. I could've had him hanged for it and he knows it. Why didn't you? That was rather careless. I didn't see him do it. You wouldn't want to hang a man if there was the slightest doubt. No, you wouldn't. Things have got to be dead even with you, is that it, Logan? Ease up there! Easy, easy. Where're you from? Salt Lake. No good back there anymore. Too populated. Get over here! Get over here! Come on! How are things along the way? One miner was killed last night over at Graves Creek. Indians? Are you game to make a night ride of it? We'll reach Ben Dance's by daylight. Fine. Howdy, Logan! Come on in. Tired? Dead. Go along in. Hello, Mr. Dance. Morning, Miss Lucy. Breakfast is awaiting. Asa, come out here and get these horses! Hi, Logan! Hi, Logan! "Hi, Logan"? "Mr. Stuart," you young varmints. Now rustle off them horses and give them a good feed. Well, how'd you find things on the way down? Not too bad. Had a little trouble over at Graves Creek. One miner was killed. Yeah, Indians. They got a Cavalry outfit under some young lieutenant combing the canyon for them. But I got a little bet with myself he'll get bushwhacked first off. He don't know Indian style. Why didn't you tell him, Ben? You can't tell them army fellows nothing. They got a little brown book. If it ain't in that little brown book, it just ain't true. How was Portland, Logan? A thousand people and raining. How can anyone live in such a crowd? Come and eat, Lucy. I couldn't eat a thing, Mrs. Dance. What she needs is some sleep. Well, hello, Caroline. How are you, Logan? Oh, I don't think you two are acquainted. Lucy, this is Caroline Marsh. Lucy Overmire. I've heard about you. I'm so sorry about your father. I brought you something from Portland. Did you? What? If you have on your best Sunday dress around noon time, I'll give it to you. Will you fix a bed for Lucy, dear? We traveled all night. And when you travel with Logan, you travel. Come along. I thought maybe she'd be on her way back to England. What for? Her folks come out here to start a new life for themselves. She's not the sort to give up just 'cause the Indians killed her pa. It's a joy having her around, Logan. We always wanted a daughter. Sure. But like all good-looking daughters, it don't look like we're going to keep her long, Ma. Logan... I mean, Mr. Stuart, do you think the Indians will break out? It's always possible, Asa. A peace treaty don't seem to mean nothing to them Rogue beasters. Well, it's their land and we're on it and they don't forget it. Things'll be all right, I reckon, unless some medicine man stirs them up or some white cuss starts something. You'll know it beforehand, they'll get insolent. That's the time to fort up. Well, this is my fort and darned if I budge. That's right, Ben. Ma is sending Caroline over to McGarry's place. Mrs. McGarry's come to her time. Now, there's everything you'll need, dear. You want me to send Dr. Balance back from Jacksonville? I can do whatever's necessary. Oh, for sure, it's only a baby. You stay at McGarry's tonight, Caroline. I'll be over tomorrow and ride back with you! Give my hellos to your ma, Lucy. Say I'm lonesome for talk. Bye, Logan! Hey! You ain't got much time! Well, here's where I leave you. It takes me back to England. It's just like my grandmother's. Hey! Come on! Thank you. Oh, Logan, there's a cabin-raising Saturday week. Liza Stone and Gray Bartlett are marrying. I'll be there. You'd have had your kiss if I hadn't been here. Yes. I'm sorry I caused you to miss it. But what's any woman to you? You're never happy except when you're on the go. I guess I'm just stuck on this Oregon or maybe I'm just ambitious. I want to see a Stuart & Company pack outfit stringing along every road. And when stages come, I want them to be my stages. Is that what makes you so restless and discontented? Or is it a woman, Logan? Must it always be a woman? Take me to the Rogue River Valley Valley Where the silvery moonlight shines Some one waits for me in the valley There among the blue-tipped pines She'll be by the river Where all heaven beams And there by the river We'll find the trail of dreams Donkey, don't you dare to dally Can't you hear the kill deer song? Say, Hi. When did Honey Bragg get into town? Well, it looks like he just rode in the way his horse is lathered. Must've done a little riding yourself. All the way from Portland. Don't tell anyone. Huh? What was that song you were singing, Hi? Oh, I don't know. Just a little song. It sounded very romantic. Well, Mandy gets that way sometimes. Silly, isn't she? She'll be by the river Where all heaven beams And there by the river We'll find the trail of dreams Donkey, don't you dare... Steady! Whoa! Whoa! Dad! Lucy! Lucy! Hello, Logan. Mommy. Nice trip, Logan? Did you enjoy yourself? Did you have a nice time, dear? Yes, it was fun. Oh, we stopped by the Dances and Mrs. Dance sends her hellos. There she is, George, there's your girl. Thank you, Logan. Did he behave himself, Lucy? Oh, you're lovely. I'd almost forgotten. Not entirely I hope, George. Is that the best you can do, George? Could you do any better? If I hadn't seen my girl for a whole month, a whole lot better. Same old roughneck. No polish at all. Did you mind my asking Logan to bring you home? What took you over to Crescent City, George? A mining claim. Looked like a real strike, but it wasn't. Another rainbow? One day, I'll bring you the pot of gold from the end of that rainbow, you'll see. Are you glad to be back, Lucy? How was the trip? Wonderful. Good night. Good night. Where's Morrow? He'll be back Tuesday. I sent 40 mules on the trip. Vane Blazier will take the Scottsburg string in the morning, 20 mules. Put this on the books, Clench. Thirty mules to be at Salem on the 20th. Henry McLane's freight. Where will you get the mules? You're spread pretty thin already. Maybe it's time for us to buy a few more. Buy, buy. Always buy, buy. Hello, Vane. Did you stop by at Dances? Yes. How is everybody? Caroline, you mean? She's fine. Do you realize you've got close on $50,000 sunk in this place? We must be rich. You ought to have $10,000 laid by for trouble. What trouble? The trouble that always comes. Why do you suppose I came here, 6,000 miles from Liverpool? This is Jacksonville, Clench, U.S.A. We sail with the tide. All Americans think that. They think the tide flows forever for them. But mark me, Logan. Gold veins run out, crops fail, men starve, wars come. And businesses fail. Then we get a new deck and deal again. So you'll buy the mules? What happened to you, Logan? We waited supper for you. I thought you and George would want to be together. Why, Logan, that's a very tender sentiment. George, when is this girl going to marry you? I doubt if she knows herself, Logan. When are you taking me, Lucy? George, do you like poetry? Must I like poetry to be your husband? We will be married when the leaves fall. You see, Logan. She strings me up and lets me swing. You mean the maple leaves that fall early, or the pine needles that never fall at all? Come on, there's a fight. Fight? Who is it? I don't know. What's going on? There's a fight at the back of the settlement. Come on! You better get up there, Logan. It's your friend Vane Blazer and Bragg. Come on, George. Don't never crowd me, boy. Nobody crowded you. Oh, you're calling me a liar. Stand up to him, Blazier. Yeah. Let him have it. I didn't call you a liar. I'll bust you up proper, boy. Having a little trouble, Vane? Hello, Bragg. Logan, my friend, how are you? I hear you've been away. I'm here and there, I'm a restless man. I've been away, too. You have? Well, you're a restless man like me. I notice you're favoring your left leg. A horse threw me. It couldn't be you fell through a window by any chance? Oh, let's get on with the fight. See you sometime, Logan. Well, by gum, it was a freeze out. Come on, Vane, buy you a drink. Never mind. I can fight my own battles. That was quite a surprise. More of a disappointment to the boys, I'd say. What can you expect from people living in the wilderness? What's wilderness got to do with it? Everything, I think. What do you say, Lucy? Some men are more primitive than others, I guess. Some men just fight it harder. Put his weight on Honey Bragg and he broke. I'd say bent. Well, broke or bent, what do you make of it, Hi? You're a lawyer, Jonas, you figure it out. I'm glad you enjoyed the trip, Lucy, but it's great to have you back. I missed you. Thank you, George. Well, see you tomorrow. You ought to do your kissing in private, George, and do it better. I'll ask you again, Logan. Could you do better? You brought it on yourself, George. Good night. Good night, Lucy. Going to play a little poker? I got to get some sleep, Oh, it's still early. I'm off on a trip tomorrow. I'm going to look for some mules. Another trip so soon? If you're not careful, one of these days you're going to end up being a tired millionaire. Then I'll take it easy. See you when you get back. Good luck. I'm riding on a silver saddle The moon is my silver saddle And long before the stars skedaddle I'll be with my love tonight She'll be in the gloaming Where all heaven beams Oh, hello, Johnny. Hi, Camrose. Ah, say, I know it's after hours, but I saw a light in your office. Mind letting me have my dust? Got some poker to play. Sure, Johnny, but I'll have to ask you to wait outside while I open the safe. Company rules. Sure, I know. The moon is my silver saddle And long before the stars skedaddle I'll be with my love tonight Me and my old Daisy, up there in the sky And my heart beating crazy, but it's no wonder why I'm riding on a silver saddle To someone who loves me right The moon is my silver saddle I'm riding the moon tonight Hello, Johnny. How were things up the Applegate? Oh, terrible. All I got for my trouble was this watch. Oh, I see. Yeah, the dandiest thing. I found it hidden in an old Indian skull. I'll trade you a good fiddle for it. What would I want with a fiddle? Well, all you can do with that is clock the time. With a fiddle you can pass the time. All right, I'll trade you for that. Oh no, not my Mandy. Mmm-mmm, no. Say, how long does it take to open a safe? Come in, Johnny. There you are, Johnny. Much obliged, Camrose. Glad to do it. Good luck with your poker. Heads. Hello, Linnet. Hello. Coming up to Lestrade's? Oh, maybe later. Uh, you feeling lucky tonight? I always feel lucky. That's my trouble. I'll see you. King high straight. Ace high. It's too good for me. And me. That cleans me. Of all the rotten luck. You're a cleaned chicken, huh? I'll have to give you my IOU, Jack. With pleasure. Marta, pen and ink for Mr. Camrose. Too bad your friend Logan couldn't be with us tonight. Oh, he's off on another trip tomorrow. Always on the move. I wish I had his energy. He came near using some of it tonight on Bragg. And Bragg backed down. What did Logan want to butt in for? Well, maybe he didn't want to see that young fellow butchered. All you boys wanted to see was a fight. Ever consider that? Better tell Logan to walk softly with Bragg. Tell Bragg to walk softly. Bragg is nothing but a low-down skunk. Oh, come, Dr. Balance. Honey Bragg's a sort of friend of mine. You have strange friends, Jack. Well, I didn't say that I like him or that I trust him. What's your idea of a friend? Any man, I suppose, who believes as I do that the human race is a horrible mistake. Always damp. Always cold. Isn't there any heat anywhere in the world? Good night. Coming my way, Howison? Mmm. Good night, Marta. Coming, George? I hear there's going to be a cabin-raising next week. Whose? Some young couple who apparently disagree with your husband's theories about perpetuating the human race. You'll come, won't you? Why do you play so high when the cards are going against you? Oh, I'll get it back. Five or six good hands in a night. Jack can't always be that lucky. You're a fool. Censure on your lips, solicitude in your eyes. Is that really for me, Marta? You're always reading things in the way I look at you. The things I'd like to read. They're not there, George. How's Lucy? Adorable. Good night, Marta. Good night. Hurry up! There it goes! There it goes! There, I think that's wide enough. That's big enough for anybody's fireplace. Here's your other door. You can get out either side in case you have trouble with the Indians or your woman. Oh, Mrs. Dance, I just can't get over it. All these people coming from miles around, people we don't even know giving their time and all to build a house for Gray and me. Yes, but don't forget it means a lot to them, too. For sure. A neighbor, a new family starting up. And another pair of hands to stand off those red beasters. Hold up! If you want to catch a man, you've got to work at it. I want no man I have to catch. Why, sure. You catch him and he catches you. A man always figures that he does the catching. The truth is, it's the woman that brings him up on the rope, him not quite knowing it. Is that the way you got Mrs. Dance? Sure. But she gave me the sign. You've gotta give a man the sign. Maybe that's so. Whoa, boy. Let's stroll down by the river. I thought we came here to help, George. Doesn't this scene of domesticity inspire you? Not to sweat over a hammer and saw. But it does inspire me to stretch out in the shade with my head on your lap. This will be a handy place for your woodpile, Liza. Oh, it's so peaceful here. Mmm. The illusion of peace is upon it. You sound rather jaded. Oh, these cabin-raisings jade me. People planting themselves in one rough spot for the rest of their lives. I'm more for mansions and plush furniture. What I wouldn't give right now to be in an expensive restaurant in Boston or New York. Mmm, with music playing. And you in a maroon waistcoat and me in an elegant green gown. Ah, Lucy, there's so much of this world that we're missing. Perhaps, George, if you took things a bit more seriously. You mean like Logan? Always figuring. More stores, more mules... What I mean is, if you didn't gamble so much. This is a gambling country. Everybody gambles. Even Logan gambles, doesn't he, every time he sends out a pack train? That's different. Well, we're different. He's not responsible for his character and neither am I for mine. You know, I feel that sometimes you make a comparison between us that leaves me at a disadvantage. George, don't complicate things. Let's keep them simple and straight. Mmm, my thoughts rarely travel in a straight line. How about your affections? My affections, always, where you're concerned Lucy. Oh, George. God bless the hands that built it, and the two that it was built for, and may they prosper and live in peace all the days of their lives. Those whom God has joined together, let no man put asunder. For as much as Gray and Liza here have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God and this company and thereto have given and pledged their troth each to the other, I pronounce that they are man and wife. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. Now kiss her, son, and let's eat. Where were you, Hi? What kept you? Well, the work all done? Yeah, you timed it just right, Hi. Cabin's all raised. The couple's spliced and ready to raise a cabin full of young'uns. Well, I couldn't find Mandy. Soy bean. Soy bean. It's nice to have a place of your own and know your children'll grow up there. If they're boys, I'd want them to take up land nearby. If they're girls, I'd want them to marry neighbors and not move off. When I'm dead, I'd like them to stand where I stood and see the things I saw. Yes, but the man you get might not want to stay in one place. Would it make you unhappy to move away? It would be hard to be always fixing a new cabin and starting a new garden. Do you like Jacksonville, Logan? It's a place to do business in. Folks say you make money, but you're always risking it. I never pay much attention to money. And you're restless, everybody says so. Yes, I guess I am. It's easy to be that way if you've nothing to keep you home. How about it, folks? Up on your feet. Grab a partner. Sing it way up high like a robin in the sky And tell them I'm getting married in the morning Put all your cares aside, come and kiss the blushing bride 'Cause honey, I'm getting married in the morning You ought to see who promised to be mine Here you are, whiskey or water! You can't dance without sweating! Lift up your hearts and shout So that the news will get about 'Cause, honey, I'm getting married in the morning That's it now! Sing it way up high like a robin in the sky And tell them I'm getting married in the morning We'll pass the little brown jug But bring a fiddle and a mug 'Cause, honey, I'm getting married in the morning Why you can hitch old Dobbin to the shay And bring the family out for a lovely day, hey! Lift up your hearts and sing when the church bells start... What you want? It's the same old story. They don't mind us coming here. It's like he says, mother earth is for all. What they don't like is the cabin. That makes the land ours. We got to live, too. That's right. Where's my boys? We've been watching them, they got no guns. Yeah, they got no guns. Good boys. Now you stay by me. Better hit it up, boys. What are you thinking, Logan? Oh, I was just thinking of what you said awhile ago, the years ahead. Caroline, do you like me well enough to make a marriage of it? Yes, Logan, I do. Caroline, it's time to pick up and go. You're a good man, Logan. And you've got a good girl. Logan! Why that's great. I know you'll be happy, Caroline. Thank you, Lucy. You see, there's nothing to it when you give him the sign. Soy bean. Soy bean. Morning, Mr. Logan. You're up early. What's on your mind? Let's have a drink. It's too early. I'm thirsty early or not. Lots of places up the street. Well, a drink's a drink. I want you and Morrow to pull out for Salem this afternoon. McLane's freight. Thirty mules. All right. What's hit you, Vane? Let's have it. All right, I'll tell you. She don't like big towns. She don't like big ideas. She don't like moving around and changing. It's her choice. You're not the man for her. I'm sorry the way it turned out for you, Vane. I didn't mean to bust out. Let's load the boxes. Bragg's up at Stutchell's. They're all expecting you up there. You might as well go. The town won't have it any other way. How about it, Logan? You got a bet on this, Johnny? Yeah, a small one. Which way? Which do you think? He'll get your eyes if he can. Kill him and be done with it. You too, Clench? Come on, it's gonna be a slaughter. He can't whip Bragg. Nobody can. How much have you got that says so? I've got a hundred. Well, put it up. You want a hunk of this, Linnet? No, I'm not betting. Did you ever see Bragg's arms? I seen him bust a two-by-four over his knee. I seen him break four of Jed Peters' ribs. He ain't got a chance. Give me a bottle, Harry, a full one. I left my gun home. I brought mine along. Let's make this a fair fight, Logan. I've got nothing against you. It's the boys that want the fun. You're lying, Bragg. What have you got against me? You ought to know. You're talking in riddles, Logan. What's on your mind? A picture of a tree, with you swinging from it. You hear that, Stutchell? Yeah. Yeah, I hear. What's the matter, Harry? Now you've got him. Beat his brains out. That's all right, Logan. I'll get you in a minute. That's all right, Logan. I'll break your back. Now, we can close in, Bragg. You think I won't? Now I've got you! Over here, Bragg. Over here. Time to put out the light! Dogs. Yellow dogs. You surprised me. Oh, that was great, Logan! Great! Now you can collect your bet, Johnny. He'll be after you the rest of your life. Why didn't you kill him? Would that have been more fun, Lucy? That's what you all came for, isn't it? Excitement? If that's the way you feel, you didn't have to fight him. Sure, I could have backed down and turned the whole town over to Bragg. But all it meant to any of you is a show. Logan! Look out! You should take my advice and put some raw meat on those eyes. They'll be all right. It's just bruises. Nothing I can do for you? Yes, one thing. Quit playing poker, George. Quit poker? What for? You can't afford it if you have to give out IOUs. Poker's the only relaxation I get around here. Mighty expensive relaxation at $500 a throw. George, what's got into you, lately? Oh, I don't know. It's just... I'm sick of this godforsaken hole. It's all right for you, you're rich. You've got your own business. You're not gonna get rich at Lestrade's. You'll end up owing him your shirt. He's practically got it already. George, are you in trouble? How much do you owe? Oh, at one place and another, a couple of thousand, maybe. Let me have $2,000, Clench. $2,000? What for? Grubstake. Grubstake. So that's what you call it. What's this? Pay them off. Just give me your word you'll quit, George. Well, if you insist, but it'll be a mighty dull world. Sure, but a man whose business is handling other people's money... Must be above suspicion. Yes, I guess you're right. But I wish I didn't have to take this. Don't feel that way about it. That's what friends are for. Sure. And long before the stars skedaddle I'll be with my love tonight She'll be in the gloaming Where all heaven beams And out there in the gloaming We'll find the trail of dreams I'm riding on a silver saddle The moon is my silver saddle And long before the stars skedaddle I'll be with my love tonight Me and my old Daisy Up there in the sky And my heart beating crazy But it's no wonder why Heads. I wish I was 10,000 miles from this place. It wouldn't make any difference, George. You'd be the same wherever you were. Wouldn't you miss me, Marta? Why should I? You've got Lucy. Have I? If you haven't, it's your own fault. Of course. But a woman is supposed to love a man because of his faults, isn't she? Some women. But not you? Oh, Marta, don't be so hard. Why can't we be friends? Why? Why can't you be a friend to yourself? How are you, Camrose? Mclver, what are you doing in town? I just blew In. I didn't expect you for another month. Well, I didn't have any luck. I just wore out shoe leather. I'll buy you a drink. Thanks. Thanks, I can't. I'll see you tomorrow. I want to get my dust out of your safe. Sure. Any time. Happy all of their lives Hello, Mack! How are you? Hello, Mclver. How are you? If you be happy Don't ever wed Just stay a free man I gotta go home, fellows. Oh, no, Mack. Come on. No, I gotta go home. I gotta go home. Come on, Johnny. Let him go. You don't know what you're missing, Mclver. Don't ever wed Till you are dead If you be happy Don't ever wed Go away? Leave Jacksonville? When? Tomorrow, the day after, as soon as we can. But why this sudden decision, George? Nothing sudden. It's just that I'm fed up with this hole. It's a place to strike it rich and if you don't, you should try your luck someplace else. Luck doesn't depend on a place. George, can't you be content here? No, I can't. Let's go in. You're upset. Lucy, I'm going. And you're going with me. You promised to marry me, didn't you? Yes. Well, when? Whenever you want. Sunday, this Sunday. Oh, no. I'll have to make a dress. Is a dress a marriage? Lucy, when did you say? Sunday? As soon as she can make a dress. Hello, Logan. Hello, Lucy. Well, George, I'm off to San Francisco in the morning, I stopped by to have a word with you in private. Sure. What's the matter, dear? Nothing. Is it true that you and George are really getting married? Yes. Oh, but why the haste? George wants to go away. But, dear... Where are you to find material for a dress in this camp? Yes, and besides, I always said that when my daughter got married, she'd have the finest wedding in the territory. I'll even get the Governor to come down. I'll tell you what. Why don't you go along with Logan to San Francisco? No. Oh, but why not, dear? There are any number of French dressmakers there. I ought to knock your head off. What's the matter? You gave me your word you'd quit poker. Yes, Logan, I did. I had every intention of keeping it. The devil tempted you, I suppose. Yes. The devil with green eyes. Envy. Envy of you, Logan. That's no answer. Maybe it's the only answer. But don't worry, I'll pay you back. I don't care about the money, George. I do. I'm pulling out, going someplace else and make a strike. Pulling out and taking Lucy with you? Lucy's my concern. Not if you're going to make her life a thing of running and hunting. Does she concern you that much? Yes, she does. I see. Logan. About San Francisco, would you mind having a woman on your hands? Why, no. I have to get a dress. You'll be in good company, Lucy. I'm starting early, I have to stop at Dance's. Aren't you staying for supper? I can't. I have something to do. Why, hello, stranger. How much did you take off Camrose last night? About 1,500 in gold, another 1,500 in a note. I want it back. You have a streak in you about Camrose. For me, he's strictly a tinhorn. Tinhorn or not, I want the money back. Look here, Logan, my business is cards... You do too well at it. If that money's not in Camrose's hands by the time I get back from San Francisco, I'll come after you. Where are you going? Shut up! What do you want? I thought it might interest you, Logan Stuart's leaving for San Francisco. Well, come on in. Where are you bound for this time, Logan? For San Francisco, to see if I can borrow some money. Are you in trouble, Logan? The trouble is my business, like young Asa here, always outgrowing his pants. You're a moving around man, Logan. Well, the hound that rustles always catches the rabbit. And there are hounds always lean and hungry from running too much. Aimed at you, my boy. I'm sure Logan didn't stop by here to see you wash dishes. Is she going to San Francisco to borrow money, too? Jealous? Should I be? No. Logan, there's nothing to delay us, is there? Not a thing. When's it going to be? Just as soon as I get back. In a couple of weeks. What's that? Down. He had to kill something. We'd better hide the saddles and get out of here. We'll have to make it back on foot. Another hard time for you to remember. That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Yes. Then don't look at me like that. Lucy, this is no good. You're lying. Logan, I want to get things straight between us before it's too late. It's too late. Maybe we can borrow a couple of horses at Elkton. Well, I'm sorry about your wedding dress, Lucy. Any dress will do. What brought you back? I ran into a little trouble, Clench. Mmm. The world is rocking with trouble this morning. Your world in particular, Logan. They've taken Camrose in for murder. Murder? Mack Mclver. They found him drowned in the creek. Looked like an accident at first. But Johnny Steele and Hi Linnet got to working on it. Where is George? They're holding court on him now up at Stutchell's. And it grew on me that Camrose was tampering with the dust the boys left with the company. He was losing a lot of money at poker... That's hearsay, Johnny. What's wrong with hearsay if it's true? Johnny, what have I got here? A silver dollar. Are you certain of it? Dead certain. Howison, what does it look like to you? You're was time, Hi. It's a plain old U.S. dollar. Well, you're mistaken. It's a Mexican dollar. You see, Johnny? What you don't see yourself, you can't swear to be true. You can't always swear that what you do see is true. Well, anyway, Camrose was losing a lot of money at poker... Hearsay, Johnny. You're trying a man for his life. Life is precious to all of you, isn't it? Well, it's precious to George Camrose. Life was good to Mclver, too, and it was took from him. Was it? Well, that's what we're here to find out. A murder trial calls for a proper judge and jury, doesn't it, Jonas? They understand that. Course we do. Get on with it. Lestrade. Lestrade, did Camrose play poker with you? Frequently. Did he lose money? Considerable. How much would you say he lost? In the course of a year, maybe $5,000. Where did you get it from? I won't say. You've gotta say. You can't compel an accused man to answer questions, Johnny. That's the law. If a man's innocent, why should he be afraid to answer questions? Linnet, did you ever see Camrose take pokes out of the office safe and pour dust from one to the other? Yes. When? It was the night before Mclver was found in the creek. I happened to see a light and I looked through the shutter. Do you make a habit of spying on people? No, but I've got a habit of observing people. Is that all you have to do? Well, Logan, you've got a big store and no time, and I've got a little store and lots of time. Order! Order! Get on with it, Johnny. All right. Now, then, Mclver came into town. The next morning, he was found dead with his face in the creek. We didn't find any dust on him, but we did find this, a receipt that Camrose gave Mack for his dust. That's your writing, George? Yes. If you gave him his dust, why didn't you take back the receipt? I seldom give receipts. You remember, Johnny, I never gave you one. I just put your dust in the safe and when you asked for it, you got it. It's been my usual custom, all you boys know that. But Mclver wanted a receipt. I merely forgot to ask for it when I gave him back his dust. Careless, I'd say. We're all careless with gold, it's the cheapest thing in camp. Is that all, Johnny? If so, it's not enough. On the testimony of a man squinting through his shutter, you've tried to show that Camrose is dishonest. And on the basis of an unreturned receipt, you deny he gave Mclver back his dust. You've proved nothing. Tell them, Linnet. Well, he came into my store a couple of days ago and traded me a nugget, and I noticed it was shaped like a shamrock, so I put it in a box, set it up in my store for good luck. Why, that's Mack's lucky piece. He always carried it. Shamrock. That's Mack's. I know that nugget. That's it. Sure, it was Mack's. Well, there's the case, Logan. Twist it if you can. Camrose could only have gotten that nugget at a time when Mack couldn't resist. In other words, when Mack was dead. I make murder out of that. Let's vote on it. Let's vote. Just a moment. Just a moment, all of you. This meeting has no sanction. If you vote this man guilty, you must still hold him over to a regular court. Remember this. Remember, if you vote this man dead on that set of facts, you'll be setting the scene for another day when you may be voting yourself dead. Vote! Vote! Let's vote! All those who think he's guilty, say so. Guilty. Guilty. Hurray! Did you know about the nugget? No. They'll hang him tonight. They'll just wait till it's dark. You've done all you could, Logan. Guilty. Oh! Dad, do you think he did it? Well, he's a weak man. Let's get along, Lucy. Logan... Lucy, Logan did everything he could. Don't ask him to do any more. Don't give us any trouble, Logan. It would be disagreeable, but disagreeable or not, we'd shoot you. That's plain. I'm glad you told me. Don't do it, Logan. You've done enough, haven't you? No man has to go against reason. Reason? Is that what makes a man hungry? Is it reason makes him fight or sends him in to Stutchell's to have a drink or makes him stand by a friend? What does make him, then? Something deeper than reason. The Indians have broken loose. They've broken out. How far did you come? Well, I guess about 40 miles. They're about 12 miles behind me here. They are? How far away are they? They got their war paint on? Sure. How big a party? George, pull on the door. Here. Take the black horse in my barn. Watch your chance, get up to the hills and keep going. Thanks, Logan. Thanks for your confidence. Don't flatter yourself. What are you doing this for? For Lucy's sake? You don't want her to see me strung up, is that it? Something like that, I guess. Everything's on fire all along the line. My wife's dead and my little girl's dead. How many Indians did you see? Big band? Little band? What made them break out? I couldn't say for sure. The ferry man said it was on account of Honey Bragg killing an Indian girl. Which way are they heading? Toward Dance's. A man ought to be tougher than that. That's a fool remark, Johnny. We'll have to raise a company. Sixty men or more. Count me in. Me, too. I'll go. On that mule? She can run. Well, you better stay here just in case. Come on, let's go. Just in case they head this way. He's gone. He broke out. Broke out? How? He busted the lock. Why didn't you watch him? I warned you, Logan. You're making long guesses again, Johnny. Whoever's going, be here in 20 minutes. Grub enough for three days. We'll take care of you later, Logan. There. Now you can let it down. There we are. Liza, you're just about the best little helper a man ever had. Oh. All right. How big an outfit was it, Logan? Thirty mules. I wonder if Morrow and Blazier got away. Hello! We were jumped, Logan, Morrow was killed. How are things here? Bad. Mr. Dance is dead and young Asa, too. Where's Caroline? She's gone. She's up in the brush hunting a cow. I found her trail, but I couldn't follow it. I'll have coffee for you all in a little while. We'll take you up to the ferry, Mrs. Dance. It'll be safer. No, I wouldn't... I wouldn't feel easy under foot in another woman's house. Well, what kind of dress was Caroline wearing? Gingham. Blue and white checked. Did she have a gun? I... I don't recollect. There was firing all around while the red beasters were here. My Ben was killed right off. It was him I was thinking about, not anybody else. Caroline was out looking for that no horn cow. She's a breechy creature, always knocking down the fence and some kind of grass up in the canyon that she yearned for. Who's that? Sing out! Hey! I'm coming in. Stay where you are! I'm dead beat. Do you want me hanging from a tree skinned and dressed? You got nothing coming to you. I'm coming in. Logan! Hey! Come here, quick. Caroline's. Caroline. Caroline. How are they all? Mrs. Dance is all right. Ben? He's dead, Caroline. So is Asa. Caroline. I want all of you to come back to Jacksonville. Put up at my place. I wouldn't want to do that. You'll be doing it soon. I don't want to leave here, Logan. I can never be a town woman again. I could never be a woman moving around. I... I'd disappoint you. It came to me last night. We're not the same. And then today, when you found me, you and Vane, I was sure. I want to look out of the window and see my man plowing. And in the evening, see him in the kitchen rocker. You're thinking of Vane. I'm thinking I'm not hurting you too much, Logan. And as time went by, I'd be hurting you, is that it? That's it. Caroline, crying helps some people a lot. Some people it doesn't help. You folks all right? Oh, yes. But what about the Dances? They were hit pretty bad. Ben and little Asa were killed. Oh, and Caroline? Caroline's all right. Well, didn't you bring her back with you? It's dangerous where she is. She didn't come. She doesn't like towns. Well, she'd better get to like them if she's marrying you. She's not. She's marrying Blazier. Well, what did I tell you? About what? About the trouble that always comes. And your Crescent pack string was destroyed over in the Applegate. The Scottsburg outfit's gone, too. Blazier got clear. You know how you stand, Logan? You're broke. This is what you lent Camrose. Where is he? Indians get him? No, one of the boys. Never mind which one. There was a lot of good in George. Yeah, he sure panned out no color. It's a thin margin, Johnny, between what could be and what is. Yeah. It was thin for you last night. We were a mind to hang you. Lucy. You see how thin the margin is. Did you know about this? Yes. In some other kind of country, he might have made the grade. There's not much left, is there? Not much. Well, Logan, now you haven't got any store, but you've got lots of time. I guess I'll have to make that trip to San Francisco after all. See if I can rustle up some credit. Want some company? If you can keep up on that mule. I'll see you. When are you leaving? In the morning. Logan, would you mind having a woman on your hands? Oh, buttermilk sky Can't you see my little donkey and me? We're as happy as a Christmas tree Heading for the one I love I'm gonna pop her the question That question Do you, darling? Do you, do? It'll be easy, so easy If I can only bank on you Oh, buttermilk sky I'm telling you why Now you know, keep it in mind tonight Keep brushing those clouds from sight Oh, buttermilk sky Don't you fail me when I'm needing you most Hang a moon above her hitching post Hitch me to the one I love
