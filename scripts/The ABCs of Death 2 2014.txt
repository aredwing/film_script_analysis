Kiss her. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. Fuckin' tits. Don't fuckin' care. What is that fucking smell? Would it kill you to smile? Fuckin' $6,000 a month to rent this place and it stinks like shit. Hi, I'm Peter Toland, welcome to "Toland's World". This week we're in Elderberry Vale in Nottinghamshire, - a thriving stretch of classic English countryside, - home to literally thousands of indigenous plants and animals, - including a 400-year-old badger sett, - which has crisscrossed this hill for untold generations. But in the last two years, the badgers have disappeared because - a shadow has fallen across this hill, a shadow in the form of this... Are you gonna pan off me? Hello? Are you going to pan to the power station? Or... Yeah OK, cut! Sorry, Peter we gotta cut there. No-no, don't cut. Do not cut. What's happening? Sorry, we lost focus a few times earlier so... Yeah? We lost focus or you, you lost focus? I... I could... I could do with another crack at that, Peter. - Sorry, yes. - Could you? Another crack. Well, what's going on? You lost focus. That's the whole point. That's your job, isn't it, Brian? We just didn't realize - you were going to move around so much so... Of course I move around, that's my style. There were some quite large movements. We could whack down a sausage for you, Peter, if that's... I don't want a sausage. Shove it up your ass! No... Look, all I meant was, maybe there's... No, look, Don, let me explain how this works, OK? It's John. Whatever your name is. I move around, you follow me. That's the way it works on Toland's World, it's like a dance. - OK? - Yeah I get it. So should we cut now and go again, or... No... no, I say cut, that's how it works on the show. OK? I call cut and until then we keep filming. You got that? Right, that's how we roll. - Alright? Good. - OK, yeah. Prick. Look, honestly, don't worry about it. It's just a little alpha male display - and it'll all blow over, I swear to you. Look, he knows you worked with Attenborough, right? So he just feels, he just feels a bit threatened. Oh, right, it's all about the Silver Leopard Awards. Yeah, he's a bit raw. Well done though. Good work. Really good work. - Yeah, cheers. - What, so does he think he should - have won them or...? - He's been nominated three times, - and now he thinks Attenborough's rigging it. I know, I know. What was that? Hang on, let me listen, let me listen, hang on. Greedy little buggers. Whoa. You still... You getting this, Brian? Yeah... the badgers. Having fun are we? Big fun. Fun times. Clue me in. Let's have a laugh. - Peter, the badgers are still here. - The badgers are still... No, the badgers are dead because of the toxins from the power station. That's what the episode is about. - Look, we put the... - Put what? I don't think we should carry on filming. Listen, you. Who are you anyway? You waltz in here at the last minute, - calling the shots. - I didn't waltz in anywhere. You... I don't want to hear any more from you, OK? But listen, Peter. Can you hear me? I mean is this for real? Of course it's real, and it's gonna get more real, - because someone's gonna get punched in a minute. Look, please. Listen Peter, I'm just trying to help. I do not wanna hear one more word from you. Shall I text you? Or...? Oh. Ow. Well don't just stand there. Give me a hand. Jesus! Peter! Peter! Pete, oh, God! Peter? Peter? Oh, Jesus. Cut. Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! People, settle. Settle. Justice will be done but not here. Fletcher Powell, this court finds you guilty - of the murder of Lucy Wilson. I didn't kill her! I did not kill her! You need to let me go! - You need to call the police. - Fuck law! You need to deal with this the right way! The only way. All local matters are dealt with internally. - You know that. - This is a matter of law! Your authorities do not stretch to those boundaries! Barclay... If you confess now, we shall call the proper authorities. Deny, and you will be executed this afternoon. - Don't stop! - Take him to the fucking woods! Very well. I killed Lucy. I dumped her body in the River Kennet beyond Eddington. There you go. There's my confession, - now call the Police! - You fucking shit! Call the Police. You said! You promised! You all heard him! You all bore witness! You shall be taken from this court to the place of execution, - with no further delay. The main headlines this lunchtime... Lucy Wilson, missing for over a month and presumed dead, - has been found alive and well in East Yorkshire. The fourteen year old had run away with her 26 year-old boyfriend, - who has been arrested by local authorities. Hey guys, she's alive. Lucy's alive! It's all over the news! Come on, faster! So this it? You're just gonna shoot me down like some dumb animal? Oh Jesus Christ, no, please! Don't do this! Father, don't let them do this... please! Dearly beloved, it hath pleased Almighty God - in His justice, to bring you under sentence - and condemnation of the law... Hold him down. You can't... please, you can't kill me! Father, please stop! You are to suffer death in such a manner - that others, warned by your example - may be the more afraid to offend. Oh, fuck! What the fuck Tobias, you didn't hit him hard enough! I'll hit him a-fucking-gain then, won't I! Oh fucking hell, you nearly took my fingers off! Well fucking move back then! Decorum, boys! Give this man his dignity! Father, shut the fuck up! For the love of God, finish this! Finish him off. And we pray, God, that you may make such use - of your punishments in this world that your soul may be saved - in the world to come. - You're blooded now. Lucy Wilson missing for over a month and presumed dead... I did not kill her! Welcome back. Looking good. Life is yours. Now you must pay me. You pay for life. You pay for life. You pay for life. You pay for life. Please don't... Shut your ugly face. Go ahead and alert them, go ahead. It's exactly what I'm about to do if you just stop interrupting. Sorry... I thought you'd like all the "tehila" to yourself. What do you mean by "tehila?" Glory. So say glory. What do you mean? If you'll shoot the rifle, - your friends will come running - and take all the credit for capturing the "Israeli bitch". What's your name? No names! Ok, so I'll make one up, - Muhammad. Very original. Instead of calling your gang, - you can climb the tree, - cut the cables, and take me to the village yourself. Or maybe you're afraid of heights? I'm not afraid of anything, you slut! Then prove it. I jumped from an airplane, - Let's see you climb a tree. If that's how you jump off an airplane perhaps you should stay in the kitchen. Look at her, I'll show her who's afraid... I don't get why you are so happy. It's not like you're getting free. I just really need to pee. Women, - you never know how to hold it in. Don't pee in your pants... Are you sure this is Cognac? Tastes more like supermarket cooking brandy. Trust me, it's the good stuff. Yeah, I don't know, Granddad. I've done wee-wees tastier than this. It's... the... good... stuff. Yuck! You could've got a TV in here. I've told you, I don't like telly. Well, just get a small one then. It's like being in the 1950s in here. Oh, have you heard something rotten about the 1950s? Look at you, my lovely little grandson. Not so little these days. Hello, this is embarrassing. Right... I'm fucking off to bed. Oh? This necklace? Yeah, it is real gold. Would look even better hanging off your tit, love. And I am absolutely loving it. "My lovely little grandson". What a twat! You're the twat, mate. Who called me a twat? Ahh, twat. Ahh, shit! Ahh, shit, twat. What are you doing in there? Oh, I'm here every night - and you keep me awake all night. With your wanking and your farting. Twat! Are you trying to look like me? Yes, is that alright? - What have you got on your finger? - I got this in Chad. It's for opening mollusks - and I'm absolutely loving it. Hey, that's my catch phrase. What is your fucking problem, Granddad? You are my fucking problem. You've been staying with me for a whole year now - and you're cramping my style. I heard you, on the phone calling me a wanker. Me, a wanker. You don't know how that hurts. Look, can you see anything that I could wank with? Can you? Can you? Can you? Can you? Ma! Die! We're fucking old! Give us our money! Die, bitch! Aw, fuck! You want your inheritance? Eat this! Go on! Take it! Let's end this goddamn thing! - Why me? She should take it! - No way! The eldest should take it! Motherfuckers! Want me to get as old as that wrinkly bitch? Let me rest now. I'm one hundred and twenty years old. Take it, please! Fucking old cunt! We don't want your stone! Take it with you to hell! I should get this house. Chita, you get the beach house. Brother, I also want the beach house. Get cash instead. My share should be in cash. Who wants my stamp collection? Inheritance my ass! Die already! Please! I'll pick the casket. Somebody call the lawyer. You can have the beach house. Chita, you're getting cash instead. Dad! Dad! You deceitful demon! Come forth, deceitful demon! Manifest yourself! Come out! In the name of Jesus! Be gone, demon! Be gone! Be gone, Satan! In the name of Jesus! Be gone, demon! Out you come, fiend! God! Out Seven Darknesses! Out Tranca Rua! Out Ze Pilintra! Transform, Lord, this Sodom into a New Jerusalem! There's disease inside of you. And we brought you here to cure it. Do not resist the love of God, boy! The Evil One set down a dwelling in you. But we cast out his spirit of depravity! Accept this! Accept this! Don't turn your face to Jesus! He sees all your filth! Yours and that other faggot's. Only that one's already gone down. He's burning in hell now. This is Satan mocking us! That's a trick, Reverend. This here is war, Reverend! No! No! No! N... LOVE IS THE LAW I'd be scared to get one of those. Hurts too much. Fuck the pain! God of Mercy... I brand this lamb... with your holy cross - so that he remembers your love... But also your wrath! LOVE IS THE LAW You are not to tell the King what the Diviner has said. I, Esagho, will tell him that his son has to be sacrificed. For the women in this harem to have more male children. My Queen! Untie him. Odionmwan, are you no longer going to carry out the king's order? Now do it. Do it as he bade you do. This lot is hers, my lord. She schemes to be the mother - of the next king of Ubiniland. Release him. Ubini. Ubini. As this beast gnashes in pain, - so shall it be for Ubini. What is this that is happening? My brother, I do not know. We have never seen anything like this before. A great wrong has been committed - against an innocent priest. Here we are, - consumed by his venom. Ogiso Owodo. It is a Prince Venom. Fuck yeah, I'll do some bath salts. Hey, I liked your movie. Did you like mine? Oh, I liked yours. Huh? Oh, I was taking a nap. I am ready. Yeah, I am dressed. I'm not going to be late, alright? Oh, my God... Excuse me, is this the fastest route? It's a busy night, lady. George is there, so yeah, I know, - they haven't seen each other since the divorce. Right? Ah, man I want to be there for that. I'd like to get there in one piece, if you don't mind. Yeah, okay, I should be there in ten minutes. Hey, shouldn't we be avoiding downtown with the parade and all? I'll be honest. It would be better if you took a walk. Hey, I can't hear you. I'm on the bike. I'll be there any second. One, two, three, four, five. - Frankie! - Hey, what's up guys? - Yo Frankie, you're famous! - Thank you, thank you. It's impossible to get across town. I don't think my cab driver knows what he's doing. Hey there, - can I take a picture of you, scary guy? You can take mine. I like your costume. Okay. We have to go meet your mom. Oh, wait, wait. Thank you. Just get us through the light, and pull over. Whatever you want, lady. Death! Forgive me! Stop! Wait a minute! I'm a human being! You're all zombies! Let me go! I didn't have a choice! Forgive me! Next case! Defendant, Kana Miyazaki, - during the recent outbreak of the "Apparent Death Syndrome" - is accused of multiple acts of aggravated homicide... Homicide? Wait... Wait a minute... ...and in 2018, while she was affected - by "Apparent Death Syndrome". You did shoot to death your daughter Mai. And that these murders were committed - despite the new wonder drug "Z-cu", - which restored life to those affected. But that drug hadn't been developed yet. Prosecution requests the death penalty. But they were trying to kill me. It was self-defense! So you are registering a guilty plea? No... I'm not. I'm your court-appointed attorney. From this point on, it's best to keep quiet... The "Z-cu" vaccine. Mr. Tanaka, who is it that killed you? Wha... What happened...? As your honors can plainly see, - beyond a reasonable doubt... the accused is guilty of murder. But I've never seen that head before! Oh, no... The murders you people committed... The same thing happened to all of us here. But I didn't kill any of you! Do you think that makes any difference? We remember everything you people did to us! Stop! Let me go... Mai... You're alive? Oh, thank God, thank God. Mai...? Your honor, I would like to call the second witness. Do you support the accused's claim - that the murders she committed were in self-defense? Yes. Mai! But... most of the time... she enjoyed killing them. Mai... what are you saying? Death! No objections! Wait a minute. Mai! Mai! Mommy, why didn't you bury me? Mai! Mai! Mai! No! Goddamn zombies... We should have killed you all! You should have died! Die! Die! I'll kill all of you! Kill you all! Kill you all! Mai... Mai! Mai! Does anyone have matches? Yeah, I got some. D- d-d-did anyone grab a m-m-map before we left? Sh-sh-sh-shucks K-K-K-Kirby, I f-f-f-forgot. D- did you f-f-f-f-f-forget too, P- Poppy? Yeah, Poppy forgot too. Boy that candle sure st-st-smells G- Good, what kind is it, P-P-P-Poppy? It's Poppy's favorite, it's P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P- P- grapes. Wha-wha-wha-wha- wha-wha-what's that? Only one way to fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-fi-find out! K- K-K-K-Kirby, I don't like it out here. Can't see a thing. Oh, oh, ah, ah, oooh. Hey look, it's a beautiful muscular man with a teeny-tiny baby. Sh-sh-should we wa-wa-wa-wa-wake him up? Hey, hello. Poppy? Do you have any more m-m-matches? Yep. Now-now-now, just wait a minute here. Hey! Say, what gives? Hello? Hello? Is anybody out there? Anybody? Hello? Where did everybody go? Oh! Huh? P-P-Poppy? B-B-Bart? Seven days of the week. 12 "S" of the - 12 Signs of the Zodiac. In the United States, can you marry your widow's sister? Oh, I've heard this before. No, because you're dead. What relationship is your nephew's brother to your brother? That's his nephew. Great. What is the missing letter in the 3rd three-letter sequence? A, B, C. B, B, D. A, E, Blank? A, B, C. B, B, D. A, E, F. Correct. Sorry. Can we wrap this up pretty soon? I need to... Actually, you're doing very well. I think it's worth your while to stick around. Really? OK, cause I kind of feel like I'm locked in now. Like, I'm in a good head space. The day before the day before yesterday - is three days after Saturday. What day is it today? Uh... Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday... Friday? Correct. Now I'm going to show you two flashcards. You tell me if the images are the same or different. Same? Different. Different. Noticed that one quick. Alright. One more question. True or false. A roller-coaster has a minimum rider - height of four feet tall. Johnny is three feet six inches tall - and Jimmy is four feet six inches tall. Jackie is taller than Johnny and shorter than Jimmy. Jackie can ride the roller-coaster. True or false. Jackie can ride the roller-coaster. She's taller than Jimmy? Shorter than Jimmy. Taller than Johnny. OK, so all these have to be true-false, right? This question reads, "true-false". OK. Can I say, "unanswerable", - or "trick question", or something like that? Under what reasoning? Well, you don't know how much taller. Like it could be, y'know, an inch. It could be two feet. I'm like looking at your face for clues. That's alright. So yeah, - my final answer is the question is unanswerable. Excellent, that is correct. Congratulations, that was a perfect score. If you can come with me right now, - I'd love to talk to you some about career opportunities. Great, I love opportunities. Great, let's go. That's not how it works. Like I told you before, - press it on at a right angle, very firmly. Otherwise you might survive. Who cares? The chamber was empty anyway. I am sorry. Do you want her lying on the table with a head wound? Then show us how it's done. It's your turn. And no cheating. The clip stays where it is. If the gun already made a "click" twice, - what are the chances of Michael dying? One in four. The chances are one in four. One in three. Remember, - press it on firmly, at a right angle. Fifty-fifty. Not a bad chance, is it? I love you. That was the door to the cellar! They've heard the shot! Maybe it isn't so bad. We are about to find out. Hey baby. Hey, sorry, did I wake you? No, no, it's fine. How are you? How's the hotel? It's fine, yeah it's alright, it's quite plush. Urm... look, I'm sorry I didn't call last night, - I just got stuck with these people... - It was... - It's OK. So how was the meeting? Good, no it was really good, not everything is nailed down, - but pretty much I think we've got a done deal, so... That's great, congratulations. So are you coming home today? I miss you. Not sure, there's another meeting this morning but... If that goes well then I should be on the night flight. How's... Is that the doorbell? Were you expecting anyone? No... Who is this? Who is it? Hello, sir... Who is it? I don't know... What do you want? Who is it? What do they want? Please go away or I'm calling the police. - What's going on, Miriam? - Don't know... Don't know what... What was that? Oh my god, he's got a hammer. He's breaking the door. - Oh, he's breaking in. He's... - What? He's opening the door. - Hello? - Give me the police. The English police. Come on... Come on... 999, which service? Police. How can I help you? You need to send somebody to my home, - an intruder's broken in. What's your name and address? Robert Walters, 35 Queen Mary Road, London. Are you at the property now, Sir? No, I'm in fucking France. I'm on the phone to my wife, now please send someone. Miriam? The police are on their way, are you OK? Shhhh... I'm in the bathroom, just... just don't speak, OK? Miriam? Miriam? Talk to me! Miriam, are you OK? Talk to me please. Miriam? Miriam. Miriam? Help! Help! Why? Why are you doing this? I love you. Whoever you are... please, I'm asking you... Don't do this. Please... don't hurt my baby. Please, there's a small baby in the room, please don't... Leave my baby alone please. What have you done to my family? Let me talk to him. What? Let me talk to my husband. It's... It's your wife... Alright. Basically why we're shooting your audition today - is to show the producers what you're comfortable doing, - what you're able to do, what you're willing to do... It's really like an attitude thing. Like, if I told you to suck my dick... ...would you do as you're told? Or would there be some sort of an issue? Open your mouth for me please. Good... You a little whore? Say it. You know... ...a lot of girls would kill for this opportunity. So you gotta stand above the competition. Wow! Phew, those are some eyes! Are you blind? We're gonna have to get some, ah, sunglasses for her - on the day of the shoot. We are gonna need to see your body. Unfortunately, producers are kind of picky about that kind of thing. So if you could just take off that retarded dress that you're wearing... Faster, please. We do not have all day, do we? Yeah... those're okay. I give 'em a "C-Minus"... Wait! What, what the fuck is that? - Oh, that's a dick... - Gross! A dick? Come on, you guys! How many fucking times is this gonna happen before - somebody starts fucking screening the girls?! Not a dick. I like dicks. What the fuck was that? Holy shit! Ooooh, yes...! Yes! Hi, honey! Hey, sweetie! Hi! Is this... is this working? Yeah, I can't believe your phone works there! Hold on, hold on, look at this, look at this. Are you seeing that? Oh wow, that is so beautiful. Tell me that's not gorgeous, right? Yeah! It is so good to see your face. I miss you! I miss you more. Where's Dylan? I think he's still sleeping. Yeah? Is he glad I'm not there? I bet he's been talking shit about me. What? No! No, not at all... Come on... Dylan loves you, okay? What'd you guys do last night? We literally took a walk... ...uh, in the sand, and we just had a couple beers. Uh-huh, on your boys' trip? It's okay, you can tell me... Okay! Three beers. But really, that was it. Um, honestly, you know, - it's just... We're just keeping it super low-key. Right. Oh, is that Dylan? Look, he's right there. Yeah, he's here. Hold on, dude, I'm on the phone. Give me one second, okay? I'm sorry... Hi, Dylan... Hi, Amber! Dude, I told you I'm on the phone, man... One second, one second... Okay... Where are you guys staying? Show me your room! Ah, honestly, it's a mess right now, you wouldn't... want to see it... You want to see our room? Yeah, give me the tour! What are you... what are you doing? Baby, I'm going to call you back... Let's give her a tour, man! Yo, what the fuck! Give me the phone! Dude! Give me my phone, give... give me... fuck! - Baby, hang up... - Hey baby, how you doin'?

Look at those itty-bitty titties! Remember when your titties used to look like that? I do! Fuck you, Dylan. Let me show you what Curt got. No, no! Look away! Look away! Did you know your boyfriend likes smelly old pussy? Did you know that? Wow! That's strong! But, funny story... ...you know you get a discount here - if you do both mother and daughter? Uggggh! Yeah, it's sick! Hold on... Put Curt back on the phone! You're disgusting! Wait, is that a screwdriver? Smelly mommy did a smelly trick with this last night... - Ugh! - Let me show ya. Don't listen to him! Baby, don't listen to him! Hang up the phone right now! - No, man, come on! - Give me the phone! Hang out with us! C'mere! Here, here, here. Do a show for Amber, okay? - Yeah! - Amber! - Suck him off. - Fuck again is extra... - No problem... - Stop it! Amber! - Yeah, I got you! - This is not me, and you know that, ok? - Seriously, stop it. - I don't know anything right now! - I have no idea who you are! - It's all Dylan, I swear, alright?

Has the heroic Prince Casio finally met his match? Oh no! Who dares challenge the evil Mindlord Zorb? Don't worry, Fantasy Man will save you. Terrify your opponents with the mighty Fantasy Man. - I wish we could help Prince Casio. - Yeah! Now you can explore the world of Zorb. Where are we? Prince Casio! We're dead! We're all fucking dead! Help me! No! No! No. No! What? Don't be scared, Princess. It's me... ...Fantasy Man. Sleep, Fungor. My old friend. Quickly, Princess, into the sack. There's no time! Quickly, into the sack! Where are we going? Almost there, Princess... We're almost there. No, no, no! Dad. I mean Mr. Takeda. Remember my Taro? The dog I loved so much? Had you looked after him better, - he would have been fine now. Just one week of responsibility. How come you couldn't take care of him? Taro was our family even before you came along. You said you were too busy for it - but for God's sake, you work at home! By the time we came home, - Tara's leg was covered by worms. All my flowers were dead too. Since then I couldn't count on you at all, - and hated everything about you. Your smell... and everything. So gross, - don't even brush your teeth. Better lose them all then. Not good at playing at all... so you became a teacher instead of a guitarist... Pathetic! Didn't you say you were going somewhere? Go get my make-up remover on the way. Mom? Remember the school's concerned about - our meals at home? No veggies because you don't like them. You don't cook so all the groceries you buy - end up going bad. My lunch was always full of junk food. Ow! So clumsy. The house is never clean and tidy. Ow! Always horny. Mr. Takeda's lack of interest in sex has made you so horny. Knock it off! Taking out your horny frustration on me, - you knock it off! The thing I still resent the most is when... You didn't care about my rash. I scratched it so hard, - and now I have this scar. You couldn't even remember I was allergic to eggs. Don't have a kid - you couldn't raise! I bet you have no idea how I've felt, - being caught in the middle. Miyuki, would you get me cigarettes? Are you going? Or what? Be nice. You want your stuff, right? Then you could get it for me, - but too busy with your guitar, aren't you? No. I'm not going. Don't leave me... Don't leave me, Ti, please. The midwife said chewing on Portlock root - will slow down the baby until I can get her from town. Just take small bites. Oh Ti, please don't leave. I don't want to be alone, please. You'll be fine, - there's years enough root in that jar, - and she's not even half a day out. Come back Ti, I don't wanna be alone again. Please, Ti! Ti! Ti! Ti! Ti! Ti? Is it him, Mama? No, it's not sweetie. What did we catch, Mama? A mean old bunny rabbit. Mom, why don't you go out and catch the rabbit - instead of waiting for it to get trapped? I can't be running around looking for rabbit with you inside of me. You should let me come out then. Why do you want to come out? Don't you like spending time with your mom? No, it's not that... Well, it sounds to me like you wanna leave your mom - in this place all by herself. That's not what I meant. Don't know what I'd do if you left me here all alone. I'm sorry Mama, - I'm just sick of eating the same things all the time is all. Well, you can come out when your dad gets back. And if you're a boy, he can take you out when he goes hunting. I hope I'm a boy. Well, he'll be back any day now. We'll find out then. But for now you're just a little baby. You alright, Mama? Where is it? There was a piece left, I know there was some left. Where's what? Mama's medicine. Calm down Mama, you gotta let me come out now. You promised, you said you won't leave. But I'm too big, and it's hurting me. Don't you leave me! I won't leave you, Mama. It's OK, Mama, I'm here, just calm down. You can't leave. Don't worry Mama, I'm not leaving. I don't wanna be alone again. I won't leave you, Mama. I just need the room, OK? Don't worry, I can fix this Mama, just stay calm. See, Mama? Now there's room for both of us. Ti, is that you? Do I really look that different? Where have you been? Don't start. I waited as long as I could, but it didn't sit right. I had to cut it out myself. Then we'll just have to try again. I don't know if I can. Of course you can. I mean, how the fuck am I meant to wank to that?
