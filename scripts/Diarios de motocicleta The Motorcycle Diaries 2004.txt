No, no, there'll be time for that Well, since we are here i can show you something The Amazon divides the colony in two The south part is where we keep the patients.|Here, in the north part is were the staff, the doctors and nurses live.|And a couple of nuns that are very efficient This is your room The beds are a little hard, but that is good for your spine You can see the hospital from here Over there|And that's the laboratory Doctor, let me introduce you to our Argentinean volunteers Alberto, i understand you have|some experience in baciloscopy - That's right|- I believe he could help us in the lab, why don't|you take him with you Ernesto, you are going to help me in the hospital Here we have the more serious cases,|we transfer them from the south area - Georgina|- Hello doctor - And do you make the operations on this side too?|- Yes, on that side we have an operating room She is Silvia, daughter of one of our patients|and a very good nurse - How is he?|- He's better, doctor - Then keep administering the same treatment|- Yes - Doctor, then how many patients live in the south area?|- Almost six hundred - All of them Peruvian?|- No, most of them yes, but there are some from|Colombia, Venezuela and other countries of South America I suggest you use these gloves.

Mother San Alberto, this gentlemen have good|medical experience in Cordoba and Buenos Aires That doesn't give them the right to behave|like this and break the rules I suggest we leave this conversation for later, ok? Thanks Mother, you are very understanding She is the Mother Superior This is the dinning hall. The nuns make lunch on Sundays,|but only for those that come to mass The sad thing is that most of San Pablo's patients are here|because they have been abandoned by their families|or thrown out of their jobs That's why they try to adapt to their new life|building their own houses, seeding, caring for animals - Doctor, good morning|- How is Silvia? - She doesn't want to go to surgery|- Thanks doctor, Ill go see her Silvia is a patient a little rebellious and if we don't|operate her ulna, she risks loosing her arm Hello Silvia She's very young Can i come inside to talk to her Yes Can i sit? Does your arm hurt? What is wrong with you? I was born with bad lungs What a shame No, is not that bad. Thanks to that|i skipped the military service I didn't have to shine anyone boots Is that why you became a doctor?|Because you are sick? Is possible.|The first word i learned was injection I want to be useful in some way - You are wasting your time|- Why? This life is hell Yes, it's really fucked up, but we have to|fight for every breath and tell Death to fuck off Hey Fuser, Bresciani is going to write me a recommendation|for an internship in Cabo Blanco's Hospital, in Caracas|What do you think?

San Pablo, Peru|June 14th, 1952 The Mother dances well, uh?|I like the way she dances No, I don't dance Thank you - It's good uh?|It's really good Listen, this is the tango that|Chichina's uncle played in Miramar - Ah yes, i like it|- You see|- Yes, yes - Do you know how to dance it?|- This one's a little faster, But you know how to dance it.|And there's a lady very interested in dancing with you - Should i ask her?|- The bird in the stories flies and never returns Fly, fly Do you want to dance? - Do you know how to dance?|- Yes Is just that this version is faster Dance Ernesto! Did you think it was a tango? Mambo, mambo, mambo Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, Ernesto, Happy birthday to you! Make three wishes Fuser Friends, one moment please... I believe this is a great opportunity to let Ernesto|and Alberto know, how grateful we are Not just for having gotten here, but also for their|commitment and enthusiasm to the patients of San Pablo|during the three weeks you have spent here For that reason, we have prepared|a little surprise Tomorrow you will receive a raft to|continue your journey and we will name it,|suggested by this night, The "Mambo Tango" Thanks a lot Speech! Speech! Well...I feel obligated to thank this toast with something|more than a conventional gesture But given the poor conditions in which we travel...|the only affectionate resource that we have is the word And is by using it, that i want to thank you all,|all the staff of the colony Thanks You, that give us this magnificent display of affection|by celebrating my birthday as you would celebrate one of yourselves And since we will leave Peru tomorrow, this|words also serve as a goodbye in which i want to put all my effort to give|a recognition to the people of this country that uninterruptedly have overwhelmed us with|nice gestures since we arrived And i would like to highlight something more,|a little off topic of this toast But don't worry, i won't dance Although our meager personalities prevent us|from being spokesmen of your cause We believe, even more after this journey, that the|separation of America in false and uncertain nationalities is completely fictitious We are a single mixed race, from Mexico|to the Strait of Magellan So, trying to free myself from any|nationality load I raise a toast for Peru and for America united Cheers What's up with you? Do you know where the boat is? No, i don't see it I'm going to celebrate my birthday on the other side Yes, of course, tomorrow when we find the boat|you will celebrate your birthday on the other side - No, now|- No you won't - My birthday is today not tomorrow|- I know Fuser but...are you crazy You can't cross the river at night with all|those animals that can eat you raw Mial, how many times in this journey did we thought|it was the end and look, here we are - This time is different Fuser|-Why? Because this time i won't be around to help you.|There's no way Im getting in the river You will always be with me Mial, come Hey, come here you bastard mother fucker, come back here.|Think of me, your mom is going to kill me Fuser, come back here.|Ernesto!

Come on, the plane is leaving! Wait, wait. This could be useful You kept it Is yours I'm off now I'll write you, ok? Fuser... I have to tell you something important. My birthday is not on April 2nd, it is on August 8th.|I told you only to motivate you - I knew|- You knew? Son of a bitch See you! See you friend! This is not the tale of impressive deeds Is a piece of two lives taken in a moment|when they were cruising together along a given path With identity of aspirations and a conjunction of dreams Was our vision too narrow, too partial, too rushed? Were our conclusions too rigid? Maybe... ...but that aimless roaming through our enormous America|has changed me more than i thought I.. ...am not myself anymore At least, Im not the same inside Eight years passed before the two of|them would meet again In 1960, Granado accepted an invitation to move|to Cuba to work as a researcher. The invitation came from his old friend Fuser,|that at the time was known as Commander Che Guevara,|one of the few influential and charismatic|leaders of the Cuban Revolution. Ernesto Che Guevara fought for his ideals in Congo|and Bolivia, where he was captured by the Regulation Army and,|with the consent of the CIA, was assassinated in October of 1967 Alberto Granado, always faithful to his friend Fuser,|remained in Cuba, where he founded the "School of|Medicine of Santiago". Today he lives in Havana|with his wife Delia, his three sons and grandsons.
