We're gonna do an EVP scan, check for possible recurrence, spontaneous psychokinesis. Heard a few things. Could be DVP's. What? - What is it? - Shh. Miguel. Miguel. Stop it. You're scaring me. What? What did you see? We need to leave. - You saw something, didn't you? - Let us get out. Please. Look. Help me! Tell me what you saw. I'm s... I'm sorry. All right, guys. Have a good day. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, love bugs. How was camp? - Great! - It was? Who was that? It's no one. They found something, didn't they? Jake, Mrs. Wallace is coming over in an hour. - Again? That was over five months ago. - We talked about this. Can I draw the menu for dinner? Oh, would you please? Video game time? Half an hour, but like basketball, none of that... You're scaring Mom. - Hi. - Hello, Ms. Heller. Hi. Come on in. Again, you can call me Madison. - Is Jacob in his room? - Yeah. I'll go get him. That's okay. I'd like to speak to him there. You know the way. Knock, knock. - Hi, Mrs. Wallace. - How are you, Jacob? Okay. I mean, good. How's camp? Have you given any thought to what we talked about in our last conversation? I still feel bad about what happened, but I don't really remember it. It's been nearly six months. We talked about you writing a letter. I didn't mean to hurt him. I just... I just couldn't stop myself. I don't know what I would write other than "I'm sorry." Jacob, you need to take responsibility. I can't help you if you don't help yourself. Hey. You know, people who do bad things... aren't always bad people. - How was it? - Good. He seems to be adjusting. He's been doing really well this summer. He's getting along really well with his tutor. I've never seen him this engaged. That's good. And how's the rest of the home? It's okay. But, you know, it's been tough. We're getting there. Well. One more visit, and then I can file my report. Then you can move on. Thank you. Let 'er rip. - Now the other one with the same... - Velocity. - Meaning they... - Have the same momentum. Excellent. Now if they both have the same momentum, why do we have such dramatically different results? Well, the wall applies a bigger stopping force over a shorter time. Good. And the sheet? The sheet has a smaller stopping force, but over a longer period. You got it. They both stop the eggs, and they both decelerate the egg's momentum to zero, but... But it takes a smaller force to decelerate the egg's momentum over time. In fact, so much smaller... that the eggshell barely even cracks. Good work today. You get to do all kinds of stuff like this in ninth grade physics. - Yeah. - What? Still not excited about surging past all your classmates? No, it's just that it's gonna be weird. Gonna be so much younger than them. You know, same thing happened to me? And if I can do it, I know you can. Hey. We're not too early? No. No problem at all. We're just winding things down actually. Hey, bud. - Thank you. - Yeah. Sam's e-mail, about the budget? Yeah. But at least she signed it with a "Thanks!" this time. Yeah. There's more kids this year, less resources. Think I'm gonna have to bring my eggs from home. It's nice to meet you. Uh, his name's Jon Bone Jovi. No kid will ever get that joke. Some might. Jon Bone Jovi. Mom, can we go? Sorry. Famished child here. Tomorrow night, then? I could also come tonight. Hurry. Tomorrow night. Go! Better run! Here I come! Okay, guys. Playtime, and we sit down for dinner in an hour. Yay! I heard you scream last night. It was a bad dream. Mom, you know we have to get out of that house... Don't scare your sister. I'm not scared. Mom, I've heard her talking to it. I'm working on it. - I know, but just... - Honey, not now. How was your lesson? Nick tells me that you're doing really good. When he was over the other night? I think he's nice. I think he's nice too. Wee! It's gonna go away. It's gonna go away. - Go back to sleep. - I heard something in the kitchen. It's fine. Just go to sleep. Here. Put this on your cut. But hold your breath. Do you think it was Dad? It wasn't Dad. About yesterday? I didn't mean to cut you off, but I don't want to scare Hales. If you want to talk, I'm here. Hey. If something is bothering you, I want you to tell me. I could sell my comics if you think that would help us get out of here. Okay. That's really sweet. But I'm handling it. I need you to trust me. It's just that when Dad... You like Hales's costume? It's almost as good as last week's. - Those wings are gonna fall off, you know. - No, they're not. Enough? Big spiders. Hey. Come here. All right. I want you to have fun at camp. Okay? I'm gonna pick you up at 4:00. I need you to watch Hales for a little bit tonight. - Yeah. - Bye. Bye. Hi. My name is Austin Hamilton. I'm a representative of Pacific Land Holdings. I know who you are. I've got your letters. Great. So you know why I'm here. That is a lovely garden. Money's been... a little tight. Yeah, Ms. Heller, I don't think you understand. But I've been authorized to make an offer on your property, buy out your existing mortgage. Do me a favor, though. Don't tell your neighbors, because, uh, the number we're offering you... is substantially higher than the open market prices we're offering them. - Why? - Well, over the next 10 years, we plan on expanding in this area, and your land... well, that's an important part of the process. Uh... What if I choose not to sell? Hmm. Well, you do know that CamSE Holdings owns the mortgage on your home. You're behind on your payments, and foreclosure... Oh. That could affect your ability to send your kids to college or... Well, I would need to see a number first. Of course. Yeah. Of course. Here. Why don't you take that? We'll get the ball rolling and have you and your family out of here in no time. Okay? Dude. Me and Steve found a way into that old car dealership on East Avenue. Hey! What? Don't throw things at my sister. Yeah? Why not? It's funny. Don't throw things at my sister! Those the only words you know? I fingered your mom with that. I heard you're a fucking psycho. But you look more like a pussy to me. I thought you'd be wearing that princess costume since you're such a f... I don't care what he called you, Jacob. - Can I talk? - Go up to your room, baby. - I said, can I talk? - Fine. Talk. - He was hurting Haley! - You broke his nose. We were almost done with Mrs. Wallace, and then you do this? You cannot get into fights. You have to go get a counselor. You can't keep sabotaging yourself like this. Do not walk away from me when I am talking to you! Your father used to... Please. Jacob, we need to talk through this. - Maybe Dad had the right idea! - What do you want me to say? That it's fine that you got into another fight? I'm sorry, okay? Jake, you have got to get control of your anger. I'm sick of talking about this! That kid was bothering Haley! Mom and Jake are fighting again, like you and Mom did. I wish they'd stop. Mom doesn't want to scare me, but she doesn't think you're you. Why aren't you saying anything? You can't get this mad all the time. I love you. I want you to be okay. Jake. Jake. Jacob! You don't understand me! Here. You okay? Haley, I'm... He just snapped and ran out. Well, he lucked out. If it had been during the school year, he might have been expelled rather than just getting kicked out of the program. But hey. Hey. I can... I can teach him someplace else. Maybe even here. That way I could see you also. Where is he right now? They're both asleep. I mean, he... He calmed down eventually. It's just... I hate seeing him like this, you know. He reminds me... - I'm sorry. I don't want to... - No. No. Hey. It's okay. You really can talk about him, you know. You know, when Mark and I first got married... we would come out here and make plans. - About what? - Future. I used to do that. Not anymore? No. After I was fired from my last job, I just kind of... learned to keep an eye on the present. Made things simpler. When Mark got worse, it was like mood swings and depression and... I know this sounds awful, but... after he was buried, I felt a sense of relief. Like I was... ready to be on my own. God, that doesn't sound awful. That sounds totally natural. I thought you said you quit. Yeah. Um... Actually, I was forced to quit. Hmm. Uh, I was doing work I was really uncomfortable with, and... Well, my boss and I, we had just a really... a difference of opinion. And so I left... and followed a new dream. And here we are. Give me one. - Sick. - Give me another one. We shouldn't. - Shouldn't? - Yeah. There's somebody there. Shut up! They're asleep. Either do it or fucking don't, but we can't just stand here. Watch thi... You hear that? What? No, I just... thought I heard someone scream outside. Are you sure it was from outside? Yeah. Why? Recently we, uh... It's nothing. Are you sure? You're very sweet. Oh. I think by "sweet," you mean "ruggedly handsome and a little bit dangerous." I definitely mean "sweet." Hmm. - I hate to ask... - Hmm. I know. - The kids are... - No. Hey. Hey. It's... It's okay. I totally understand. - It's been a tough week for us. - Seriously. It's okay. I'll, uh... I'll call you tomorrow. Hello? Mom! Mom! What? You okay? It must have gone away. Haley. Let's go. Hey. Calm down. Be right back. Did it hurt you? Mom. We're leaving. Is everything going to be okay? It's okay, baby. It's okay. Come here. Your arms. Oh, my God. - Mom, that hurts. - Just a little bit more, okay? Don't look at it, baby. Don't look at it. Come on. Jacob. Let's go. Jacob. Come on. Hey, honey. I want you to take your sister and wait right outside. - Okay. Come on. - Right outside. Hey. Hey. Hi. Sorry. No. Can we just come stay with you for a little bit? No, I can't explain right now. No, I just... Okay. We'll be there in 20. Mom! Mom! Mom! Jake! Jake, what happened? Talk to me. Haley, bring me the phone. Baby, please. Mommy needs you. Go grab the phone. You'll be okay, honey. Okay. Help! Is Jacob going to be okay? He's gonna be fine, sweetie. Haley! Haley. Come here, baby girl. I'm here. Help! It's okay, baby. 911. What's your emergency? My children. Something's wrong! Ma'am, I need you to stay calm. - Mom. - What happened to your children? I'm okay. - Mom! - Ma'am? Ma'am? - Do you need assistance? - No. - Are you sure, ma'am? - No, they're fine. He looked like he was going to die. I mean, they're fine now, like you saw. But out here... I'll need to do some tests on the children as well. If you don't mind. Yes. Thank you. Okay. Last one. You did an excellent job. Let's see how it goes. - Hello? - Hello, Ms. Heller. This is Austin Hamilton. Yes. Um... I wanted to follow up on our conversation yesterday. - Like I said, we'd like to move quickly on this. - I'm gonna have to call you back. Sounds good. Okay. I just wanted to mention that we've gotten... I will call you back. Geez. What does it mean? Well, it means that the two of you are in very good health... and you have no visible reactions to common allergens. Well, then you're testing them for the wrong things. May I speak to you alone? Ms. Heller, I've done every test I can on your children. Right now, I can't find anything obvious. Maybe when I get back to the lab. So what are you saying? That we just stay in the house? Until I finish processing the blood work, yeah. They seem fine while they're inside. I've seen cases like this before, where maybe they're experiencing symptoms brought on by stress. Perhaps you are too. This isn't stress. This isn't psychosomatic. This is very, very real. They almost died. You've told me that. Right now, I can't find anything wrong with them. Do you think I'm lying? I could also observe their symptoms while they're outside. I'm not doing that to my children. Thank you for your time. I'll run the samples at the lab and notify you if I turn up anything. Haley? Hales. Haley. Haley. What are you drawing? Um... Dinosaurs. I think the horses are queens and the dinosaurs are soldiers. Are they friends? Um, sort of. Did you know that horses and dinosaurs lived millions and millions of years apart? Yep. But I got bored of drawing horses. It's okay. It's okay. Just stay here. Jacob? Jesus. Jacob! What? Don't scare us like that. Haley, it's okay. It's just your brother. Oh. God. What are you doing down here? I thought I can try and fix this. Oh, my gosh. Wow. You remember this? No. You used to love Halloween so much. I don't remember it. He told me not to make the volcano. I only did it because he thought I should do something different. I couldn't stop yelling at him, and then he left, and... It's all my fault, Mommy. Jake, stop. He didn't leave because of your argument. He left because I told him to. Hey. Your dad had become a really... angry man. And I couldn't take it anymore. Okay? It was nothing that you did. Jake! Haley? Jacob? Hey, guys. Yeah? - Are you okay? - Uh-huh. I tried the front but nobody answered. - Mr. Hamilton... - Austin, please. I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd stop by. Now listen. It will only take a day or two to get that paperwork going, and then... I'm sorry. Look, I'm not gonna be able to, at least not right now. There's been some complications, and I can't... Look, I'm trying to help you here. Okay? Because we could begin foreclosure proceedings at any time. This is harassment. I'm only a month behind. You're as behind as we say you are. Now I don't know if somebody is giving you bad advice here, but this offer is real. The offer doesn't make a difference. My children are sick. Okay? We can't leave this house. I'm sure they'd be just as comfortable someplace else. Maybe even more so. - You don't understand. - Okay. Why don't you think about it then, and I'll come back. What? Hey. Sorry. I, um... I thought that you were someone else. Um, you mean the guy that was walking down the driveway? He's, um... Forget it. Um, I just wanted to check on you guys and see if you were okay. You guys didn't come over the other night. I just... I didn't really know what to think. So are you guys okay? I don't know. What's... What's going on? You know, I haven't been as... open with you... as I should be. You deserve that. You deserve to be with someone that can offer that to you. Wow. Um... Where's this all coming from? There's a situation in my life that I can't talk to you about. - Okay. - Look, I don't want you to get hurt. Okay, I understand. - I'm sorry. I... - Hey. You know what? It's okay. Mom! I can't find my dragon tail! It's in the laundry room. One sec. No. - Can we try again? - Hey! No! Madison! No! Step away from the door! No! Get up! Go! No! Madison! But we have to call people. This is enormous. This changes almost everything that we know of... I've called the police so many times, thinking that someone has broken in. I've had paranormal psychologists here. Mediums, clairvoyants, priests. No one believes me. Let me help you. The burns. Who did you speak to about them? They can be analyzed. I had an immunologist come to the house. He... He thinks that it's psychosomatic. And the kids. They can't be more than a few feet away? I mean, I've tried to find similar cases... Something to try to make this make sense. There was a... There was a scientist at CamSET. He couldn't leave his office, and the doctors couldn't figure out why. How often does it appear? Sometimes never. Sometimes twice a day. Some are more grotesque than others. There are others? There are three different things. And it always manifests like that? The same way every time? Mm-hmm. There's a flash of light, and then something appears. And then another flash of light, and then it's gone. Okay. What else? Uh, sometimes the rooms get colder. A strange hum. Doors open and shut. I've heard Haley talking to them. And the electronics... Does anything happen to the electronics? The electronics go crazy. It's never the same. I've seen one of them walk through walls. This is incredible. You're experiencing a phenomenon that has never been fully documented. This is... Nick, this is my family. We'll figure this out. I promise. Hey, Carl. It's the last time I can do this. - No kidding, Nick. It's the last time. - I know. I know. - It's all in here. - Cameras? Two of them. How's the shop? It's good. The guys are asking about you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Are they still, uh... - Yeah. I'm not as high up the ladder as you were, Nick. I don't know if they're... they're still doing that. But they are still using your work. ECHO is really gaining steam. - Wow. - What are you working on? - Uh, just some experiments, you know. - Uh-huh. I'll get these back to you as soon as I can, Carl. Yep. Be smart. Ms. Heller, I want you to understand that I only have Jacob's best interests in mind. You know, about the fight... He was protecting Haley. He knows what he did was wrong. May I speak with him? Jacob, do you know how serious this is? Can you tell me why you hurt Danny? He was... He was throwing things at Haley. And when I saw him hurting her, I... I told him to stop, twice, and he kept on doing it. And I'm sorry. I really am. I just... I was just scared that he might've hurt her even more. So what happens now? I'm not sure that this is the healthiest environment for your children. A bully was hurting his five-year-old sister. Come on. What was he supposed to do? He needs to show some restraints. Why does that other kid get the benefit of the doubt and Jacob doesn't? Because that kid didn't beat another child unconscious in the last six months. He's lucky to have escaped juvenile hall in the first place. Jacqueline, you know him. Look, Jacob is a special kid. I can see that. But these incidents can't keep repeating. Danny's family want to push for legal action. And you know what? I agree with them. Jacob needs to learn that his violent behavior has consequences. He's just a kid. I will give you a copy of my report. In the meantime, I suggest you obtain some legal counsel. No one is taking him out of this house. Good luck, Ms. Heller. Don't go past the steps. Is it bad? It's not great. But no. No, it's something that we're going to deal with. And it's... it's going to be okay. I really tried. Come here. Oh. Be careful. God, where did all this come from? Uh, a friend of mine owed me a favor. Uh, you said that the phenomena always starts and ends with a flash. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, a flash denotes energy output, so... with this, we'll be able to measure any sort of strange readings, any spikes in energy, jumps in background radiation, stuff like that. - Careful. - You know? Hey. Can you grab me that case? Thank you. This sees up to 10,000 frames per second. Which means that we will see everything. I will put one upstairs as well. And... Hey, hey. Madison. It's going to be okay. - I mean, if it tries to hurt my kids again... - I know. This is cool. Uh, I measured the normal electromagnetic readings of the house, and we'll find out if that number changes. So... We just wait. - I learned it from him! - No, you did not. I'll take ownership of that. I'll take blame for that one. Ready? Let's do this. It's my turn. Where's my ship? - Where's my ship? Oh, here it is. - Found it! This is an important roll, guys. I'm nervous. You guys ready for this? Haley, are you stealing... - Really? - I'm not doing this. My goodness. Okay. All right. - One, two, three... - Yeah, you lost. I know it for sure. - You're going to go to jail. - Aw. All I do is go to jail in this game. - You should practice more. - Oh, I should practice more? - Haley, do I need to practice more? - Maybe. Maybe? That's so sweet. - Can I put them anywhere now? - Uh-uh. Just a little more? Fill it up. Yeah! - Train station! - To the train station? - All right. It's my turn, so watch out. - All right, let's go. - What do you got? - Ready? It's happening. - Jacob! - Jacob, come back! - What's that sound? - Mom! - Go. - It's okay. Go! Upstairs! Go. No! In here! Stay back! We hurt it. How's that possible? I don't know, buddy. We have data now. Lots of it, so... Can I help? Yeah. Bring me that notebook. Well, you do know that CamSE Holdings owns the mortgage on your home. We'll get the ball rolling and have you and your family out of here in no time. That doesn't make sense. Okay, play it again. There, there. Do you hear it? - It's a pattern. - We need to isolate it. Okay, play it one more time. What is that? - What are those? - Sequenced intervals. - Is it energy output? - No. No, not this. This is too... No, it's too regular. It's repeating, like it's on a constant loop. Jacob, go downstairs. What is Project ECHO? - What? - What is it? How did you hear about ECHO? Why didn't you tell me that you worked at CamSET? Madison, the work that I was doing there was horrible. I was afraid that if you found out about the things that I'd done, you would hate me or I would lose you. I didn't want that, Madison. I'm sorry. What exactly were you working on? - Are you part of this? - Part of what? They're doing this! Doing what? What do you mean? You were experimenting on people. No. No. ECHO wouldn't be possible for another 40 years. - This teleportation is impossible. - Then explain this. Madison, look. This isn't me. Okay? The state... They offered us volunteers... that were prisoners, were injured or worse. No one at CamSET cared. I tried to stop them, I swear. I just found out too late, Madison. Let me help you. Okay? I know what's going on. I can show you what's happening. The patterns... The patterns that I've been measuring from your house... They've been coming up regular intervals, constantly looping over and over again. - What do these numbers look like? - Coordinates. Right. Look at this first one. Okay? Now, look at the second. - The signal is coming from CamSET. - Exactly! CamSET is trying to force us out of this house. They're expanding here. We need to shut them down. No. No, you can't. - Watch me. - No, no. Madison, you don't understand. You can't. What's happening isn't happening right now. Like I said, it was 40 years out, even in our most optimistic projections. The prisoner that's coming here? He's coming from the future. And I don't know how to stop that. Then we'll kill them. Don't touch any of these. Hey. I mean it. Jacob, if you need to. Come on. - Jacob... - I know, Mom. Haley. Hey. I need you to be brave. Okay? I need you to listen to your brother. And no matter what, do not come out of that basement until I come for you, okay? Mama, come with us. I can't. I will be back so soon. Okay? I love you. Go! Go. Ms. Heller. Ms. Heller, I brought the contract with me. Goddamn it. Ms. Heller... - 911, what's your emergency? - Help me. Help me! Hey! Hey, over here! Come on! What's happening? It'll be okay. Madison, you have to kill it. Are you okay? Are you okay? Ma'am, step away from him. Sebastian to backup, 1214 Woodbine. Officers, there's a man outside trying to kill us. Ma'am, what's the situation here? Officer, my kids are in the basement. Please. Haley! Jacob! Come here, baby. Ma'am? Are you okay? What's going on in there? No! Stay away! Go away! Mom! Hey. No. Why? Oh, my God. Oh, God. No. No. - Hang on. Hang on. - Mom? Madison. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hang on. Hang on. Okay? It's going to be okay. You stay with us. Hang on. Hang on. Haley. Haley, get over here. Press down right here. Okay? Not too hard. - Can you do that? - Yes. Jacob, you watch him. (SOFTLY) Hi. Come on, Mom. - Shh. Shh. Shh. - Mama. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, hey, hey. You stay with me. - Mama, stay with us. - You stay with us, please. - I can't. - Yes, you can. - Yes, you can. - Someone needs to stop this. Hey. Don't. We need you. Jacob, you won't understand right now. Please stay. Mama, stay. Come here. Come here. Mom's gotta do something. Come here. Yeah, that's it. Nice and easy now, Jacob. Man, they said not to call these guys by name 'cause their brains are scrambled. Don't let the file fool ya. He's got something going on up there. It ain't much, but... it's something. Hey. So you think he knows what's going on? Maybe. They've had him here for the past 40-some odd years. They caught him trying to blow the place up. - No shit? - Yeah. Something about revenge for his mother. I mean, the things they put this guy through, man. - Turn your blood cold. - What are they doing today? They're going to teleport my man about 10 miles away from here. Should be quite a sight. Yeah, they tried this with some others, but it wasn't quite so pretty. This man can usually take whatever it is they dish out to him. This little ride would be a piece of cake for him. Stop! Nothing to see here. Please get back in your homes. Jacob, come on. Let's go upstairs.
