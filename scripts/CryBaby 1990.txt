Penny a piece. Six for a nickel. Ah, you owe me from yesterday, young man. Please, look, look, I'll pay you tomorrow. Wouldn't you like to have one? Oh, come on, just a drag. [Snickering] Just a drag! No cash, no tobacco. Go on, scram. Hey, Mona! Get over here and help your poor mother. [Coughing] [People chattering] Hi, kids. Remember, always look both ways before crossing. Mother! We're having your favorite supper tonight, Wanda. Potatoes au gratin. (all) Mmm. Now walk. Look left, look right. That's right, then walk. Good teenagers. Are you gonna work this summer? ##[Music playing on car stereo] (Hector) Wanda, honey. You want a ride home with Dad? I got a lift. Thanks, anyway. We could count out-of-state license plates. I saw one this morning all the way up from Virginia. Dad, would you just leave me alone? Bye, honey. (woman) # O look, daddy, you're so cool # # But I can't break my momma's rules # # She would have to see what's in your family tree # # Before she would let you come home just for me # (man) # Oh, you thinking about marriage # # Now and then # # Oh, you goin' pretty steady # # Now and then # I am so tired of being good. # Well, I think I'm ready # # This is what you need # # Do you have plenty money? # # Yes, I do # # Tell me, is it all in cash? # # Just for you # # Will you give me all your lovin'? # # If you're true # # Then I will love you long as well # Hi. Well. You're a pretty little Square. Want to hang out with us Drapes tonight? [Groaning] Allison Vernon-Williams, get in this car. What's the trouble, honey? These hoodlums bothering you? (Allison) No, no, we were just talking. Grandmother, Baldwin, this is Wade Walker. They call me Cry-Baby. This here is my sister, Pepper. Greetings, Granny-o. Allison's my girl, so hands off, Cry-Baby. You could have fooled me, Square. Mrs. Vernon-Williams, I hear you're having a talent show at your charm school today. I can barely imagine what you would call music. I can sing pretty good. "Well," not "good." Haven't you ever heard of the English language? Don't go flip out, mama. Yeah. Sometimes shook-up old ladies get cut. (Baldwin) Come on, honey. They're just bums. Mr. Puniverse wants a fat lip. I'd like to hear you sing. (Grandmother) I will say this once and once only. Stay away from my granddaughter, you common juvenile delinquents. It was nice talking to you all. # Just you and me # # Go see our father # # Just you and me # # Tell our sisters and our brothers # # Just you and me # Let's go. [All cheering] # That you're going to marry me ## The prettiest and most talented girl in school and yet she socializes with Drapes. We're Squares, Allison, and Squares got to stick together. Yeah, but Drapes are people, too. They just look different. Maybe Cry-Baby can sing. Something cool, something hep. And where did you learn those vulgar jazz words? Your poor dead parents would turn over in their graves. It's those jukebox records she listens to. Honey, his kind of music isn't even on the Hit Parade. How can I think when you're always touching me? I have told you, Baldwin, a young lady does not like to be pawed. [Laughing] ##[Women and Cadillacs by The Nite Riders playing on car stereo] # The woman want a Cadillac she don't want no man # # I used to have a woman, said she loved me so # # I used to have a woman, said she loved me so # I think Cry-Baby's got a girlfriend. Cry-Baby and Allison sitting in a tree K-l-S-S-l-N-G. Shut up, Milton. [All laugh] Hey, Hatchet-Face, you think Cry-Baby's got blue balls for the chick? Allison's a Square, Wanda. Cry-Baby don't dig Squares. No, she's a "Scrape." Part Square, part Drape. I think she's pretty. Cry-Baby, want some hooch? I don't drink and drive. [Tires screeching] # Mess around with me # # Turn back, baby # # Mess around with me # You're too young to know the shameful truth about the Walker boy's family. But let me warn you, evil is in his blood. [Car horn honking] ##[Gee by The Crows playing] # Love that girl # # Oh, please # # Listen to me # Move up, now. That's not funny. # Why I love that girl # # Love that girl # # Hold me, baby, squeeze me # # Never let me go # # I'm not takin' chances # You're a dead man, Walker. # Oh, Gee, # # Yes, I love her ## [car horn honking] (Baldwin) Car! Car! [Screaming] [Tires screeching] [Car horns blaring] [All whooping] ##[Music playing] [People chattering] [Girls chattering] [Microphone squeaks] Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the annual RSVP Talent Show. (audience) Good afternoon, Mrs. Vernon-Williams. First, I must apologize for my frazzled nerves. However, this afternoon we were attacked by a gang of juvenile delinquents. [Audience gasps] It's all right. No one was injured. Juvenile delinquents are everywhere. Right here in this community. Boys with long hair and tattoos who spit on the sidewalk. Can't believe it. (woman) How disgusting. Girls who wear tight slacks. Hysterectomy pants, I call them. [All murmuring] And if one of these creatures ever approach you on the street, you are to silently repeat to yourself the four "B's" you learned here at RSVP. And what are they, children, the four "B's"? (all) Beauty, brains, breeding, bounty! [Audience applauding] Yes! Yes! Teenagers everywhere, repent! Let Jesus Christ be your gang leader! Get out of Turkey Point before it's too late. Oh, take it easy, honey. I'm not getting any younger here, you know. Oh! That is what I call a real great shape. Knockers up, sweetheart. Oh. Here it is! Beautiful. All right, here you go, honey pot. Thanks for the picture. Mmm. All right, who's up? Toe-Joe Jackson's art photography right here! Be a nudie-cutie, make good money to bootie. Hey, I'm paying $3 a shot. You got it, what the hell, why not show it, right? Hey, you. Yeah, you, the looker with the class-A sealed-beam headlights. You want to pose for Toe-Joe? Beat it, creep. Here he comes now, with that devil woman. Hi, Mrs. Hackett. Imagine our shame. Our only child, and he carries illegal weapons, drives fast cars, and wears clothes obviously designed by homosexuals. But he knows better. Jesus is still in his heart. Jeez, Mom and Dad, go home. You're embarrassing me. I'm a teenager. I want to live. ##[Music playing] Hey! Looks like somebody lost their laundry. Hello, Cry-Baby. You scorch me, man. Later, Lenora. But, Cry-Baby, I need a date for tonight's Jukebox Jamboree. Well, I'm solo, sugar. Want to see these gunboats? I give, Cry-Baby. I give bare second on the first date. Use your mentality and cool down. Well, Lenora, your bosoms ain't nothing. Better watch it, bozo. You might catch a cold. My brother wouldn't touch your titties with a 10-foot pole. He likes his women bad, Lenora, not cheap. ##[Scatting] # Oh, life could be a dream # # If I could take you up in paradise up above # # If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love # [girls chattering] # Life could be a dream, sweetheart # # Hello hello again, sh-boom, and hopin' we'll meet again # # Oh, life could be a dream # # If only all my precious plans # # Would come true # # If you would let me spend my whole life lovin' you # # Life could be a dream # # Sweetheart # # Sh-boom sh-boom # # Ya-da-da Da-da-da Da-da-da Da # # Sh-boom sh-boom # # Ya-da-da Da-da-da Da-da-da Da # # Sh-boom sh-boom # # Ya-da-da Da-da-da Da-da-da Da, sh-boom # [girls squealing] # Now every time, I look at you # # Something is on my mind # # If you do what I want you to do # # Baby, we'd be so fine # # Oh, life could be a dream # # If I could take you up in paradise up above # # If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love # # Life could be a dream, sweetheart # # Hello hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again # # Sh-boom sh-boom # # Life could be a dream, sweetheart ## [audience applauding] Uncle Belvedere! Wow! You caught me in my birthday suit, butt-naked. Grandma, we're home! How much? (Ramona) That muffler? Dupree, for you $15, take it or leave it. Come on, Ramona. $10. This thing's hotter than a pistol. You guys wanna do business with Ramona Rickettes or would you rather shop at Sears? Now, give me the bread and keep your trap shut. You're a hard woman. I'm going to see you in hell, Dupree. [Laughing] Go on, get out of here. [Kids chattering] Have you been bothering your great-grandma all day? She has customers. Hell, no. They helped me steal a car. It's a '51 Olds. It's really cool. That's my little Snare-Drum. And, Ma, I swiped six hubcaps like a big girl. Way to go, Susie-Q. Make those monster faces, Hatchet. Please. [Howling] [Children screaming] Goddamn gopher's digging up my front yard. What are you teenagers waiting for? Turkey Point is open for business! Let's celebrate! [All cheering] Come on. Come on, everybody. Come on in. Today's a special day for me and your grandmother. We've been together 10 whole years. [All whooping] I'm just so proud of all my Drape children. Oh, Wanda, you sure is pretty in them tight clothes all painted up like trash. I wish you and Belvedere were my parents. Oh. Now, Milton, boy, you are everything a man should be. You're young, stupid, and mean. We're gonna play some cool music for you tonight, Ramona. And, Hatchet-Face. Oh, honey. You're just like me. Now, you put the "T" in "tough." So hard, you could've been eating nails for breakfast. But that's the way a woman's got to be these days. I'd kick a Square's ass for you in a minute, Mrs. Rickettes. Oh, this is the best gang my grandson could ever have. Grandma, I'm so happy all knocked up I wish I was having triplets. Well, we got a little surprise for your young one in your oven. You show her, Bel. Sure will. (Cry-Baby) Oh, Pep, ain't that cute? It's beautiful, Grandma. Cry-Baby. When you was a boy, you had to be the man of this family. But I taught you how to dress, didn't I? You sure did, Uncle Belvedere. Yeah, well, you're the future now, boy. You're the only future for this godforsaken family. And I want you to go out there tonight and sing, boy. I want you to sing your heart out. You can show him now, Belvedere. This took a lot of hubcaps, Cry-Baby. [Gasping] [All cheering] Grandmother, Uncle Belvedere, you've made me the happiest juvenile delinquent in Baltimore. And guess what? [Motorcycle engine rumbling] I met a girl! # My friends all know it # # How I adore him # # I've whispered to angels # # What I'd do for him # # He is the answer # # To a teenage prayer # # He won't go steady # # The crowd has told me # # But I keep waiting # # To have him hold me # # Why won't you listen # # To a teenage prayer # # I wait by the window at seven # # and chill when my thrill passes by # # His kiss could send me to heaven # # Into his arms I would fly # ##[My Heart Goes by Nappy Brown playing] # My heart goes # # Piddily patter, patter piddily patter # # Every time I look at you ## (Allison) # My girlfriend, Betty # # Tells me, he's lazy # # But I know Betty # # Loves him like crazy # # He is the answer # # To a teenage prayer # # Yes, he's the answer ## [siren alarm blaring] All right, girls. What this is, this is unfortunately a red alert. So please take your duck-and-cover positions immediately. It is only an air-raid drill. There are no atom bombs actually being dropped. You were incredible, honey. Where did you learn to sing like that? Just practicing. Baldwin. [Siren alarm recedes] All right, boys and girls. [Sighs] That's the all-clear signal. You can come out now. Everyone is safe and sound. [Motorcycle engine idling] [All gasping] Stay in your places. [People chattering] Get back to your room. (boy #1) Is he here? Is he here? (boy #2) I can't see anything. That's him. Cry-Baby Walker. [Sighing] I'm sorry about this afternoon, Mrs. Vernon-Williams. Is Allison home? 'Cause, uh, I'm gonna sing tonight and I thought she might like to hear me. [Groans] Mind your manners. This is what we think of your kind of music. [Grunting] How dare you hit him! You don't own me, Baldwin. I have the right to hear Cry-Baby sing. Don't get all worked up, honey. The punk got what he deserved. [All gasping] Come on. Allison. Get up. Go! Go! Go! Hop on, honey. Just one minute, young lady... I'll take good care of her, Mrs. Vernon-Williams. I promise. And it's okay about my face. It don't hurt much. Please. It's not a school night, and I have been a good girl. Just one night of happiness, that's all I ask. But what if you get your dress dirty? [Sighs] Thank you, Grandmother. ##[Pistol Packin' Mama by Al Dexter playing] # Drinking beer in a cabaret and was I having fun # # Until one night she caught me right # # And now I'm on the run # # Lay that pistol down, babe # # Lay that pistol down # # Pistol packin' mama # # Lay that pistol down # [thunder clapping] # Drinking beer in a cabaret # # And dancing with a blonde # # Until one night she caught me right # # And now I'm on the run # # Lay that pistol down, babe # # Lay that pistol down # # Pistol packin' mama # # Lay that pistol down # [all cheering] # Pistol packin' mama # # Lay that pistol down ## [all cheering] ##[I'm So Young by Students playing] # I have a girlfriend # # She says I'm her only one # # We want to get married # # But we're so young # # So young # # Can't marry no one # # But we know our # # heart's direction # # So young # # Can't marry no one ## You okay?

It's really wild. But I'm... I'm afraid that I'm not going to fit in here. You know, with your friends and stuff. You're cool, Allison. You just look Square. Underneath it all, I think you're really hep. Well, what have we here? First Square to ever set foot in Turkey Point. Hey, fine mama. Welcome to the Jukebox Jamboree. These are the Cry-Baby girls. That's Wanda. Dig it, babe. You need a new look. (Hatchet-face) Don't you got tits? Stick them out, for God's sake. That's Hatchet-Face. She don't mean no harm. First thing a Cry-Baby girl learns, our bazooms are our weapons. Now, Pepper's pregnant. But she can fight like a man. I wouldn't be caught dead in a full skirt. Hey, girls. What do you think?

Kiss me hard. [Thunder clapping] I've never given a French kiss before. Watch. It's easy. You just open your mouth, and I open mine, and we wiggle our tongues together. And it feels real sexy. I won't get mononucleosis, will I? No, Allison. Just try it. If you don't like it, I promise I'll stop. # I'll get you yet # # Someday, Cherry # # You'll be my pet # # Right now # # Cherry # # The day is set ## (boy) Break the window. [Laughing] I'm sorry, Allison. It's just that you are so beautiful. I want to let you, but I can't. For my parents' sake. Cry-Baby, they're both dead. I'm an orphan. I'm sorry, Allison. No wonder we're together, honey. I'm an orphan, too. You are? Yes. And orphans have special needs. Just on the outside of the shirt, okay? Is it okay with you? Yes. Oh, yes! My parents were, they good people and they... they loved me. I want you. I need you. I love you, too, Allison. They had to go on a business trip together. It was their first airplane ride. Oh, Cry-Baby, your fingers feel so good. I've been saving it up for a girl like you, honey. Mommy and Daddy took separate planes for safety. In case one plane crashed, I would still have a living parent. But, Cry-Baby, both planes crashed and I never saw my parents alive again. [Thunder cracking] Goddamn! Lightning! What's the matter, Cry-Baby? Everything is the matter. It's just a thunderstorm. Heat lightning. It's sexy. It's not sexy. Electricity makes me insane. Why, Cry-Baby? Why? Here's why. Electricity killed my parents. They died in the electric chair? That's right, Allison. My father was the Alphabet Bomber. He may have been crazy, but he was my pop. The only one I ever had. God. I read about the Alphabet Bomber. Bombs exploding in the... the airport, the barbershop. That's right, all in alphabetical order. Carwash, drugstore. I used to lay in my cradle and hear him scream in his sleep. # A, B, C, D, E, F, G ## [mimics explosions] But your mom? My mother tried to stop him. She couldn't even spell, for Christ's sake, but they fried her, too. But I'll pay them all back, Allison. That's why, every day, I gotta do something rotten for my parents' sake and I cry for what I have to do. But not much, though. One single, salty tear is all that they will ever suck out of this Cry-Baby. [Thunder clapping] [Yelling] Cry-Baby. [Grunting] [People screaming] [All yelling] [Laughing] [Police car siren wailing] I'm going to have his baby. (Baldwin) Allison! [Wind whooshing] Oh, my God. What have they done to you? Allison, come home. They beat me and kicked me. All because I love you. [Screaming] [Thunder clapping] [Engine revving] Get on. Don't do it, Allison. No! (all) Too smart to work, too cool to care. Come to Turkey Point, man, if you dare. Too smart to work, too cool to care. Come to Turkey Point, man, if you dare. L-Let her go. She's with me. Her name is Allison and she is a nice girl. Allison, I'm sorry to get you locked up. But tonight, well, you were the coolest date I ever had. But, Cry-Baby, who is that girl? Why didn't you tell me you already had a lady friend? Lenora ain't nothing to me, I swear on my daddy's grave. I'm burning inside to touch you, baby. (reporter #1) How do you feel about your granddaughter becoming a Drapette? (reporter #2) Mrs. Vernon-Williams, a picture, please. Please, no pictures. [People chattering] Get your hands off! Get your hands off of me! [People shouting] [Inaudible] [Sputters] (judge) Order. Order in this courtroom. What a sad vision of today's youth. The juvenile authorities have had it with Drape gangs. Milton Hackett. Wanda Woodward. Mona Malnorowski, also known as Hatchet-Face. You are blights on this community. Are the parents here? Yes, Your Honor. We have been praying all night for our son. And praying so hard that we got headaches. Hi, Wanda honey. You were on the radio. Would you just get me the fuck out of here? What does "fuck" mean, Hector? Oh, Maggie, it's just a teen nonsense word Wanda uses to make herself feel all grown-up. Your Honor, could we take Wanda the fuck home? [All laughing] [Gavel pounding] Good God! Order. Order in this courtroom. You hear that, Your Honor? It's a sign. [Speaking indistinctly] She is speaking in tongues. God is in her gullet. And he is in yours, too. Let him out. Let the words of the Savior be heard. Order! Order! No wonder your children are in trouble. And you, Miss Malnorowski... By the way, that's a shame about your face. There's nothing the matter with my face. I got character. I see that your parents haven't taken the trouble to come to get you. (Mr. Malnorowski) Oh, yes, we did. You happy now, Mona? You finally did it. You put your own mother in an iron lung. Mrs. Malnorowski, there is no smoking in this courtroom. Why not? I pay taxes on cigarettes, don't I? And what do I get for those taxes? Happiness? Hell, no. I get tuberculosis. [Explodes] Oh, Christ! Now I got a flat tire. I'm going to release these delinquents to their parents' custody. And if they were mine, I'd give them a bare-assed whipping. Ohm, they can sing, Your Honor. You should hear them. Oh, it's new, it's exciting. We don't know what to call it. It sort of rocks, man, it spins. Yeah. Let me get the right words. It twirls. It twirls. Ramona and Belvedere Rickettes, I find you guilty of disturbing the peace and I fine the both of you $1,000. That's all we have. How are we supposed to live? Damn you. Handcuff those brats. Don't touch my children. (judge) And you, Pepper Walker, I'm going to have your two children put in the custody of the Chatterbox Orphanage, until they're adopted by God-fearing parents who at least will give them Christian names. (Pepper) Not my children. They're my flesh and blood. They're all I have! Mrs. Tadlock. Get away from them. [All clamoring] Don't you touch them! Come on. (Pepper) I love you, children. (judge) Wade Walker, better known as "Cry-Baby" what a sad and silly name for a young man. You were the ringleader in tonight's gang war. Grandmother, help him. We were just singing together. [People murmuring] Judge, let Allison go and I'll take the full blame. I didn't mean no harm, Mrs. Vernon-Williams. I may be a Drape, but I love your granddaughter. And if that's a crime, I'll stand convicted, ma'am. Your Honor, I am Allison's grandmother. And, uh, if Mr. Walker does have musical talent, I am willing to give him a second chance. Won't you? The boy is at least polite. Mrs. Vernon-Williams, are you aware that negroes were present at tonight's disturbance? My granddaughter is fond of all kinds of music. I am going to release Allison this one time, because you are a fine and beautiful woman, Mrs. Vernon-Williams. [People murmuring] But not you, Cry-Baby Walker. The only place you're going to sing is in jail. No! I find you guilty of rampant juvenile delinquency and I hereby sentence you to the Maryland Training School for Boys until your 21st birthday. Ha! [Banging gavel] Court dismissed. [People exclaiming] Lock him up! You can't lock up his music! [Crowd clamoring] I'll get out, sugar dumpling, if it's the last thing I do! I swear. Cry-Baby! ##[In The Jailhouse by Webb Pierce playing] # He's in the jailhouse now He's in the jailhouse now # # He's in the jailhouse now ## Boy, do I have a story for you. How does it feel to be a juvenile delinquent? It feels good. I've never been so happy in my whole life. (man) I hear you were... Lenora, you filthy hag. I wouldn't let you shine my boots! Allison's my girl. A-L-L-l-S-O-N, fellows. (male reporter) When did he propose? [Reporters clamoring] Oh, just last night. You see, I'm pregnant with his child. Well, you know that Cry-Baby is an orphan. He wants his baby to have a real family for the family that he himself never had. [Inmates clamoring] (guard) Break it up! [All applauding] Shut up! Delinquents, hit the sack! (man) Oh, I swear. Strip down, asshole. It's beddy-bye time. [Grunting] Now, don't forget to say your prayers. God bless my probation officer.

Following last night's disturbance at Turkey Point Cry-Baby Walker had the nerve to announce his engagement to fellow gang member and known hussy, Lenora Frigid, mother-to-be of his child. Cry-Baby is an orphan. He wants his baby to have a real family for the family that he himself never had. Wade Walker, defiantly entering the Maryland Training School for Boys had this to say: It feels good, man. I've never been so happy in my whole life. ##[Band playing] [People chattering] [People screaming] [People clamoring] ##[Band continues playing] Hurry, Allison, hide.

I'd be proud to, Baldwin. Cry-Baby Walker, I hope you're happy with Lenora. I only have one thing to say to you. I think you're a liar and a cad, and I spit on your tears.
