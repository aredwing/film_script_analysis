As a matter of fact you won't I've travelled on the 6:13 for the last time. - Good heavens, you've been travelling on it for years. - Forty-two, to be precise. - Retiring - Retiring? - You don't look the retiring sort - As a matter of fact I'm not. - A slight touch of arthritis - Arthritis? - Arthur my dear fellow, you're talking to the right man. My wife's brother was a martyr... A positive martyr. He found a specialist fellow... The specialist saw him and said... Goodbye! Good luck! Arthur! You're back, dear. - Mother, I'm nearly ready. - Yes, Ronnie darling. Your father will be with you in a minute. - What am I not to be told? - Can't you guess? - How does he look in it? - Quite adorable! - Where's Catherine? - She's in the garden, I think. Yes. There she is, doing her envelopes. - Should I tell her you're in? - No, don't. From now on, for my family I will always be in. - Oh Arthur dear, I'm sorry - I'd forgotten today was your last day at the bank. - What was it like? - They gave me a watch. To Arthur Winslow, from friends and colleagues at Lloyds Bank, 09.09.1912. - How nice. - I don't know how you feel, Arthur... - But I'm glad it's all over now. - I'm glad that at last you can have a real rest. I thought I made it clear to Dickie not to play that infernal machine in the drawing room. Hello, Father. I was just practicing... - The "Bunny Hug" - What? The "Bunny Hug". It's a cross between the "Turkey Trot" and "Kangaroo Hop". - Did you finish that work this afternoon? - No... Not exactly. But... I think it's time you found out that I'm not spending 200 a year in keeping you at Oxford in order... that you may learn to dance the... - "Bunny Hop". - "Hug", Father. The exact description of the contortion is immaterial. I consider it disgraceful that a 19-y-o boy should be .,.. Set an example in conduct and industry by his 12-y-o brother. I see, so that's being brought up again, is it? Ronnie got into the Navy, where I failed. Well, I think it's the first to not be understood by his own family. If you go to your room, I suggest that you take that object with you. I'm terribly sorry, I'm afraid I'm trespassing - That's all right. - My name Watherstone. My father and I only moved in yesterday. I know. We admired your sideboard very much. It is rather nice. You must have a great many friends. Not all are my friends. But I wish they were. "Votes for Women". So you're a suffragette. Do not be alarmed. I'm not militant. I won't chain myself to your railings. His father is a retired colonel and he is captain of the Royal Artillery. - Good Bye. - Good Bye. Mother, can I come in now? Yes, Ronnie darling. Remember it is a surprise. Father? Not like that Ronnie. Like this. That's better. That's the first thing they teach you when you get to Osborne. Turn around. He's quite the little naval officer our Master Ronnie, isn't he? He is a Navy Officer, Violet. It is no longer our Master Ronnie. Cadet Ronald Winslow, Royal Navy. Yes, I won't forget... See you soon. Goodbye, Ronnie. You have a great chance. I know you won't let us down. I won't, Father. Goodbye! Goodbye! Hello, mother and father. I am very happy. I would like some more jam. I scored a goal yesterday. My chemistry's not too bad. Thanks for the cake. Please send more jam. Dear father, you will be getting my first term report next week . I've got my fingers crossed. I miss you all very much. I'm counting the days until the end of the term. Hooray! There are only 32 to go. I can tie 16 different kinds of knots. Old Simpson says I can't draw a map for toffee. Silly old fool. Dear Mother, please send more jam. Tell Kate I swapped my last jar for a guinea pig. I called it Kate. Only nine days, 17 hours and 22 minutes before the end of term. Your loving son, Ronnie You haven't forgotten that John is coming at 12:30? Master Ronnie! - Hello, Violet. - Aren't you coming in? We weren't expecting you back until Tuesday. Yes, I know. Why ever didn't you let us know you were coming, you silly boy? Your mother should have been at the station to meet you. Where are they, Violet? - Church, of course. - Oh, yes. It's Sunday, isn't it.. What's the matter with you? What have they been doing to you at Osborne? - What do you mean? - Well they seem to have made you a bit soft in the head or something. Well? Don't I get a kiss? Or are you too grown up for that, now? Sorry, Violet. That's better. - Where's your luggage? - They're sending it on later. Well, I must get these things dry. They'll be so pleased to see you. All things bright and beautiful, All Creatures Great and Small, All things wise and wonderful, The Lord God made them all The rich man in his castle The poor man at his gate. God made them high and lowly And ordered their estate. All things bright and beautiful, All Creatures Great and Small, You'll receive John in the study, dear, won't you? - Yes. - He should be here at any moment. I hope you'll be kind, father. You're not going to let me down and forbid the match, or anything, are you? No. Look here, my dear I'm much to keen on the prospect of getting you off my hands at last. I'm not sure if I like that "at last". That will be John. Quick, let's go into the conservatory. You've forgotten your bag. What on earth is going on here? We're leaving you alone with John. When you're finished, cough or something. What do you mean 'or something'? I know. Knock on the floor three times with your stick and then we'll come in.. Do not you think that might look a trifle... coincidental? We'll be out here. Captain Watherstone. How are you, John? Forgive me for not getting up. My arthritis has been troubling me a lot lately. - I'm sorry to hear that, sir. - Sit down, won't you. Well, I understand that... Would you be so good as to ring that bell? Thank you. Do you smoke? Yes, sir. Thank you. In moderation, of course. Well now, I understand you... wish to marry my daughter. Yes sir, of course, Sir. Why, of course? There are plenty of people about who don't wish to marry her. But we won't quibble about that. I think we'll take the romantic side of the project for granted. As for the more practical aspect, however... she is not, in case you might think otherwise... - the daughter of a rich man. - I didn't think otherwise, sir. Apart from a small pension, we have nothing. Except what I managed to save during my career at the bank. I propose to settle on her one sixth of my total capital. That's very generous of you, sir. Not as generous as I would have liked to be. Now, about your own income? Are you able to live on it? - No, sir. I'm in the regular army. - Yes. But my army pay is supplemented with by allowance from my father. You rang, sir? Yes, Violet. My compliments to Mr. Dickie... and if he does not stop that cacophonous hullaballoo at once... I'll throw him and his infernal machine into the street. Yes, sir. What was that word again? Cac - something? Never mind. Say what you like, only stop it. I'll do my best, sir. - Excuse me. - Where are you going, Violet? I must tell Mr. Dickie to stop... "caco" something. Well, that all seems perfectly satisfactory. Perfectly satisfactory. - I don't think I need to delay my congratulations any longer. - Thank you very much, sir. Pretty rotten weather, isn't it, sir? Vile. - Would you care for another cigarette? - Thank you sir, but I'm still smoking. Yes... Well, well. My wife and daughter here of all places. Come in, Grace. Come in, Catherine. John is here. Why, John - how nice! Well? - Well what? - How did your little talk go? I understood that you were not supposed to know that we were having a little talk. You really are infuriating. Is everything all right, John? I'm so glad, I really am. - Thank you, Mrs. Winslow.. - May I kiss you? After all, I'm practically your mother now. By the same token, I'm practically your father, but if you will forgive me... Certainly, sir. Well Grace, I think this calls for a little celebration. Where are the keys to the cellar? I'll get them for you, dear. - Was it an ordeal? - I was scared to death. Poor darling. The annoying thing was I had a lot of neatly turned phrases ready for him... and he wouldn't let me use them. Anything about loving me a little? I thought we could take that for granted. So did your father,. incidentally. Kate! Ronnie! - What on earth are you doing here? - Where's father? All right, all right, he's downstairs, I'll find him. - No, don't. Please, Kate, don't! - What's the matter, darling? You're wet through. - You'd better go and change. - No! What's the trouble, darling? You can tell me. - Oh, shall I...? - In the dining room. Now, darling, tell me.. What is it? Have you run away? What is it then? This letter's addressed to your father. Did you open it? - Yes. - You shouldn't' have done that. I was going to tear it up. Then I didn't know what to do. - I didn't do it, Kate... - Really I didn't. Of course not, darling. - Shall we tear it up now? - No, darling. We could tell father term ended two days sooner. No, dear. Hullo, Ronnie, old lad. How's everything? Trouble? I'm sorry. Stay here with him. I'll find mother. All right. What's up old chap? - Nothing. - Come on, you can tell me. It's all right. Have you been sacked? Bad luck. What for? Stealing. - Good lord! I didn't know they sacked chaps for that these days. - But... At school we used to pinch everything we could jolly well lay our hands on, all of us. I remember there was one chap - Carstairs his name was - captain of cricket, believe it or not... absolutely nothing was safe with him - nothing at all. Pinched a squash racquet of mine once, I remember. Believe me, old chap, pinching's nothing. Nothing at all. - There darling! It's all right now. - I didn't do it mother. No darling. Of course you didn't. We'll get out of these nasty wet clothes now, shall we? - You won't tell father. Promise you won't! - No darling. Not yet. I promise. Come along now. - I didn't do it. I promise you. - Of course you didn't. - If father looks like coming up, for heaven's sake head him off. - I'll watch out for him. I say - who's going to break the news to him eventually? I mean, someone'll have to. - Don't let's worry about that now. - Well you can count me out.. I don't want to be within a thousand miles of that explosion. Bad news? How can people be so cruel? Has he been expelled? How little imagination some people have. Why should they torture a child of that age? What's the point of it? What's he supposed to have done? Stolen some money. Ten days ago, it said in the letter.. Why on earth didn't they let us know? - It does seem a bit heartless, I admit. - Heartless? It's cold, calculated inhumanity. Think what that poor little creature has been through these last ten days down there. Entirely alone, with no one to look after him... Knowing what he had to face at the end of it. No wonder he's nearly out of his mind. I'd love to have that commanding officer here for just two minutes, I'd... Darling, it's natural you should feel angry about it. But you must remember, he's not really at school. - He's in the Navy. - What difference does that make? They have ways of doing things in the service that may seem to an outsider horribly brutal... but at least they're always scrupulously fair.. You can take it from me, that there must have been a very full inquiry before they'd take a step of this sort. What's more, if there's been ten days' delay, it could only have been in order to give the boy a better chance to clear himself. I'm sorry, Catherine. I'd have done better to keep my mouth shut.. No, what you said was perfectly true - Forgive me. Nothing to forgive Grace, when did we last have the cellar looked at? I can't remember, dear. I thought we'd try a little of the Madeira before luncheon. Yes, we must drink a toast to the um... Happy pair, I think, is the phrase that is eluding you - Well, as a matter of fact, I was looking for something new to say -. No one - with the possible exception of Bernard Shaw - could possibly find anything new to say about an engaged couple. Ah Dickie, just in time to celebrate Katherine's engagement to John. Oh, is that all finally spliced up now? Kate definitely being entered for the marriage stakes. Good egg! Quite so. I should have added just now - with the possible exception of Bernard Shaw and Dickie Winslow... Are we allowed to drink our own healths? - I think it's permissible. - No. That's bad luck. We defy augury. You mustn't say that, John, dear. I know. You can drink each other's health. That's all right.. To John and Catherine. To John and Catherine. Ah. Violet. We mustn't leave you out. You must join this toast.. Well - thank you sir. - Not too much, sir, please. Just a sip. - Quite so. Your reluctance would be more convincing if I hadn't noticed you'd brought an extra glass. Oh, I didn't bring it for myself, sir. I brought it for Master Ronnie. - Miss Kate and Mr. John. - You brought it for Master Ronnie, Violet? Well - I thought you might allow him just a sip, sir. Just to drink the toast. He's that grown up these days. He's not due back from Osborne until Tuesday, Violet. Oh, no, sir. He's back already. Came back unexpectedly this morning... - ...all by himself. - No, Violet. That isn't true.. Well, I saw him with my own two eyes, sir, as large as life, just as you got in from church... and then I heard Mrs Winslow talking to him in his room. Grace - what does this mean? Catherine, did you know that Ronnie was back? Yes. - Dickie? - Yes, Father. Is the boy very ill? Answer me, someone! If he's ill I must be with him. No, father. He's not ill. Will someone please tell me what has happened? He brought this letter for you, Arthur. Read it. Arthur, not in front of... Read it. Dear Sir... I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty... to inform you that they have received a communication from the Commanding Officer of the Royal Naval College at Osborne... reporting the theft of a five shilling postal order. Investigation of the circumstances of the case leaves no other conclusion possible... that the postal order was taken by... your son, Cadet Ronald Arthur Winslow. My lords deeply regret that they must therefore request you to withdraw your son from the College. It is signed by someone... I can't quite read his name... Violet, will you ask Master Ronnie to come down here, please. Perhaps the rest of you would go in to luncheon. Grace, would you take them in? - Arthur, don't you think... - Dickie? - Will you please decant that bottle of claret? - Yes, Father. Arthur? Please don't... Please don't... What mustn't I do? Please don't forget he's only a child. Give me that letter, please. Come in. Come in and shut the door. Come over here. Why aren't you in your uniform? It got wet. How did it get wet? It was out in the garden, in the rain. Why? I was hiding. From me? Don't you remember you promised me that, if you ever got into trouble of any sort you would come to me first? Yes, Father. Why didn't you come to me now? Why did you have to go and hide in the garden? I don't know. Are you so frightened of me? It says in this letter that you stole a postal order. Now, I don't want to say a word until you've heard what I've got to say. If you did it, you must tell me. I shan't be angry with you, Ronnie... ...provided you tell me the truth. But if you tell me a lie... I shall know it... because a lie between you and me cannot be hidden. I shall know it Ronnie... ...so remember that before you speak. Did you steal this postal order? No, father. I didn't. Did you stole this postal order? No, father. I didn't. Go on back to bed. In future, I trust that a son of mine will at least show enough sense to come in out of the rain. Yes, Father. - Will you carve, dear, dear? - Of course. Forgive me for keeping you waiting. - I'm Captain Flower. - How do you do? Won't you sit down? Thank you. I'm sorry you've given yourself the trouble of coming down here at all. As I told you on the telephone... I'm afraid there is so very little I can do to help you. - There is so very little I want to do, sir. - Anything, of course. Take my boy back. That, I'm afraid, is quite impossible. The discipline here is very strict, stricter than at a civilian school. Of course, I can well understand that you as the boy's father... might think that stealing of five shillings a very trifling of fence. No sir, I do not. - I beg your pardon? - I consider it a very serious offense. Anybody guilty of it should be expelled forthwith. I see. You believe you boy to be innocent? No, sir. I know my boy to be innocent. Mr. Winslow... I assure you the evidence is irrefutable. All the same, I intend to refute it. What is the evidence? That I am not empowered to tell you, I'm afraid. Who is your superior officer? I am directly responsible to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. I see. To any Lord in particular or to all of their Lordships? Well, that I can easily find out for myself. Goodbye, sir. Thank you for your courtesy. - Good night, sir. - Good night, Violet. - Hello, dear. - Hello. So, what's happened? Nothing much. What are you going to do? In the words of our Prime Minister: "Wait and see." It think it's extremely droll, don't you? Oh very. I remember Nelly Farren and Fred Leslie. That was before my time. - Can I get you anything, darling? - No, but you can help me with this, please. - Good heavens, here's Desmond. - Who? Desmond Curry, the family solicitor. Darling, be nice to him, won't you. Why? Am I usually rude to your friends? No, but he's been, sort of fond of me for years. It's a family joke. Hello, Desmond. This is the last place in the world I'd expect to find you. As a matter of fact it's our annual celebration of our cricket club. I am the treasurer. I don't think you've met John Watherstone. - No. But I've heard a lot about you. - How do you do? I see from the Times I've got to congratulate you both. Thank you so much. Of course it was expected, but it was a shock to see it in cold print. I hope you both will be very happy. Thank you, Desmond. - Are you any relation of the D.W.H. Curry who used to play for Middlesex? - I am D.W.H Curry. You are? You used to be a schoolboy hero of mine. Was I indeed. D.W.H. Curry in person. - I'd never have thought it. - Very few people would now, I'm afraid. Oh! Here's mother. Desmond, we'll see you in the next interval. - Of course. - Good. Hello, Desmond. Do you know Colonel Watherstone? - Mr. Curry. - How do you do, sir? Ah Desmond, just the man I want. - I need your advice. - Is it about those shares? No, something more important. I want to draft a letter to the Admiralty. - Are you conversant, sir, with the facts of this case? - Perfectly, I was briefed not half an hour ago. What do you want us to do about your son, Mr. Winslow? Give him a fair trial. A civil trial or a court martial? Either, provided he is given the opportunity to defend himself. A Court Martial is out of the question, on account of his age. Then make it a civil trial. Mr. Curry has assures me there's a legal procedure by which... There is no legal procedure by which a servant of the King can sue the King. - On the contrary, sir. - I am not talking solicitors' shop, sir. I'm talking facts. Come, Mr. Winslow. Be reasonable. But don't you see? If we allow your boy to sue us... we should create a precedent. A very dangerous precedent. Dangerous to whom, sir? To us, to the Navy, to the country. No, sir. The service has its own laws and we must abide by them. And by no others. I'm sorry, Mr. Winslow. But we cannot allow you a civil trial. Have you ever studied Magna Carta, sir? Not very closely, I'm afraid. Have you? Closely enough to know there's a clause that states... that no subject of the King may be condemned without a trial. My son, I presume, is a subject of the King. Certainly He has been sentenced without trial. From the purely civilian point of view, yes. Well, from a purely civil point of view, I am going to fight you sir! And I'm going to win. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon, Mr. Winslow. - I'm looking for Mr. Hamilton. Yes, sir. My name is Winslow. I have an appointment with my member of parliament, Mr. Hamilton. Yes, sir. Mr. Hamilton is standing over there, sir. Just a moment, sir. Pardon me. There is a Mr Winslow waiting to see you, sir. Over there. Mr. Winslow? My name's Hamilton. How do you do? My solicitor, Mr. Curry. How do you do? I'm sorry I couldn't see you earlier. We've been working night and day this last week... National Health Insurance and all that. Come along and tell me what's it all about. Well, it all began... - I say! Jolly good! - Thank you, Dickie. - Who taught you? John, I suppose? - No, I taught John, as it happens. Feminism - even in love? Hello, Father. Father? - Good news? - He's going to press for an inquiry. - What you think will happen? - Who can tell? Let us see democracy at work Is the Right Honourable gentleman aware... that this matter is causing a most violent feeling among poultry farmers all over the UK And is he, or is he not prepared to do anything about it? The answer to both parts of the question is in the negative. Mr. Hamilton? Number 56. sir, for the First Lord of the Admiralty. The case of this naval cadet has been thoroughly investigated by the Admiralty... who have come to the conclusion there are no grounds whatever for reopening the matter. Further to that answer, might I ask whether the First Lord is aware... that this boy has been condemned without any trial of any kind... and, therefore, there has been a breach of Magna Carta? I regret I can add nothing to what I have previously said. The Admiralty are quite satisfied that cadet Onslow... Cadet Winslow is guilty of a grave misdemeanour and has been dealt with accordingly. Without a trial? Disgraceful! A very interesting letter here in the Times this morning from the Bishop of Chichester. - What about? - This Winslow business. Oh, that. Personally I think that fellow Winslow is a perfect fool. I don't agree. Winslow is only doing what any father would do. Nonsense. If he hadn't made such a fuss, no one would ever have heard the name Winslow. The Evening News. Mr. Winslow? Good afternoon. You're surprised to see a lady reporter? I know. And yet why not? What could be more natural? What indeed. Won't you come in? Yes, thank you very much. What I'd really like to do is to get a nice picture of you and your little boy. I've brought my assistant and camera. They're in the hall. Where is your little boy? He should be here in a few minutes. He came back from school yesterday. Won't you sit down? Yes, thank you very much. School. How interesting! So you got a school to take him? I mean, they didn't mind the unpleasantness? No. And why is he coming back this time? He hasn't been expelled again, if is what you're implying. He is coming to London to be examined by Sir Robert Morton... whom we are hoping to brief with the case... Sir Robert Morton? Well! But do you really think he'll take a little case like this? - Madam, this is not a little case. - No, no, of course not... Still, Sir Robert Morton. After all he is the best advocate in the country. - He's certainly the most expensive. - Ah, yes... But if one is prepared to pay his fee, one can get him for almost any case. Madam, once more - this is not almost any case. No, no, of course not. Oh, what charming curtains! What are they made of? - Hello, Father. - Mind my leg. Sorry, father. Ah! Now that's exactly the way I'd like to take my picture. Would you hold it, Mr Winslow? Hold it, my little man. Excellent. Who's she? Evening News. Fred! Will you come in now? Afternoon, all. That's the pose I suggest, Fred It'll do. Grace, dear. this lady is from the Evening News. She is extremely interested in your curtains. - Oh, really! How nice! - Yes, indeed, I was wondering what they were made of. Well, it's an entirely new material, you know. I'm afraid I don't know what it's called. Ready, Miss. Barnes. This is quite a thing involving you... especially with Sir Robert at work on your case. Yes, that's splendid. Yes, it's great. The Winslow Boy. That's the young Winslow. - That's the young Winslow. - Young Winslow... Read all about the young Winslow! Good afternoon. - Ah, Mr. Curry. - Good afternoon. Sir Robert is still in court The verdict hasn't come through yet in the Rogers' Case. We're expecting him at any moment now. The jury retired about an hour ago. - Would you wait in Sir Robert's room. - Thank you. Of course there can be only one verdict after the speech he made yesterday. Yes, I read it. I should hate to be in the position of the defence. Do you think I ought to telephone Mr Winslow To tell him Sir Robert's not yet here? Wait a moment. Now let me see... We have Lord Cheviot at five o'clock That shouldn't take long... and Mr. Mayhew of Mahyew, Saunderson and Saunderson. Mr. Mayhew is most anxious to brief us for the Imperial Copper case... against the Inland Revenue. Then, ah, yeah yeah, yeah... Look over the last speech in the House of Commons. That's the Ireland question. And then he must go home and change. There might still be time. There doesn't seem to be much hope. Excuse me, will you? Hello? Ah, yes! Thank you very much. Goodbye. The result will be through any moment now. It's well worthwhile your waiting. - May I come in, dear? - Yes, Father. Come in. - John is coming for you here, I take it? - Yes. I think perhaps it might be better if you didn't ask him in. Desmond has just telephoned that Sir Robert Morton is coming here. Here? Why? I don't know. He suggested it. Have you seen this? Glen Rogers guilty. Sir Robert Morton wins principal court battle. Looks like we picked a winner, doesn't it? I see I am thinking only of myself in saying that. You know what I think of Sir Robert Morton, father. Don't let us go into it now. It's too late anyway. It's not too late. He hasn't accepted the brief yet. I'd rather say he never does. I made enquiries about the fellow you suggested. Desmond says he isn't in the same street as Morton. Not nearly as fashionable. Well, I want the best. The best in this case certainly isn't Morton. Then why does everyone say he is? Because, if you happen to be a large monopoly... attacking a trade union... or a "Tory" paper libelling a Labor leader... then he is the best. But it defeats me how you or anyone else could expect a man of his record... to have even a tenth of his heart... in a case where the boot is entirely on the other foot. I believe you are prejudiced because he spoke against women's suffrage. Well, of course I am. I'm prejudiced because he is always speaking against what is right and just. Well I have an instinct about Morton. And you are my only ally, Kate. - Without you I would have given up long ago. - Oh, rubbish. We'll see which is right, My instinct or your reason. I'm afraid we will. Arthur, I almost forgot your massage. - What about it? - We have plenty of time before Sir Robert comes. Here is the ointment. No. Doctors you have won't mind. Do you have another appointment with them? Might have. No sense in spending all this money on doctors unless you do what they expect. All right. All right. That's the boy. - I say, you look stunning! - Thank you, Dickie. Out on the revel with John? You must have a sixth sense. There he is. All right, Violet. It's only Mr. Watherstone, I'll go. John, you're late... Oh... I'm so sorry, I was expecting a friend. - Good evening. - Good evening. Miss. Winslow, Sir Robert Morton. Please come in. - Won't you sit down, Sir Robert. My father won't be long. - Thank you. - Won't you sit here? It's far more comfortable. - No thank you. - Sir Robert has a most important dinner appointment, so we came a little early. - I see. I'm afraid he can only stay a very few minutes of his most valuable time. It's a long way for him to come - So far from his chambers - - and very good of him to do it, if I may say so. I know. I assure you we're very conscious of it. Shall I advise your father of our presence? Yes do, Desmond. You'll find him in his bedroom having his back rubbed. Thanks, Kate. Is there anything I can get you, Sir Robert? A glass of sherry or a whisky and soda? No thank you. - Do you smoke? - No thank you. - I hope you do not mind if I do. - Why should I? Many people find it quite shocking. A lady is surely entitled to behave as she pleases in her own home. - Won't you take your coat off, Sir Robert? - No thank you. You find it cold in here? I'm sorry. It's perfectly all right. At what time are you dining? - At half past eight. - Far from here? Devonshire House. Oh. Then of course you mustn't on any account be late. No. I suppose you know the history of this case, do you, Sir Robert? I believe I have seen most of the relevant documents. Do you think we can bring the case into court by a collusive action? I really have no idea. - Curry and Curry seem to think that might hold. - Do they? They are a very reliable firm. I'm rather surprised that a case of this sort should interest you, Sir Robert. - Are you? - It seems such a very trivial affair, compared to most of your great triumphs. I was in court yesterday during your cross-examination of Len Rogers. Oh yes. - It was masterly. - Thank you. The verdict must have pleased you enormously. Three years hard labour. Many people believed him to be innocent, you know. So I believe. As it happens, however, he was guilty. Sir Robert? My husband's so sorry to have kept you, but he's just coming. - It's perfectly all right. How do you do? - Sir Robert is dining at Devonshire House, mother. Oh, really? Then you have to be punctual, of course. I do see that.. Here is my husband. I hope Catherine entertained you all right? Very well, thank you. Sir Robert? I'm Arthur Winslow. - How do you do? - I understand you are pressed for time. Yes, he's dining with the Duchess of Devonshire. Is he indeed? My son should be down in a minute. I expect you'll want to examine him.. A few questions perhaps. I fear that's all I'll have time for this evening. - - I'm sorry to hear that. He's come down from school especially for this interview. And I was hoping that by the end of it. I should know definitely yes or no if you would accept the brief. Perhaps Sir Robert would consent to finish his examination some other time? - It might be arranged. - Tomorrow? Tomorrow is impossible. I'm in court all morning and in the House of Commons for the rest of the day. If a further examination should prove necessary, it will have to be sometime next week. I see. - Do forgive me if I sit down. - Please. Curry tells me you think it might be possible to proceed by a Petition of Right. What is a Petition of Right? Granting the assumption that the Admiralty, as the King, can do no wrong -. I thought that was exactly the assumption we refused to grant? Only in law, I mean. A subject can sue the Crown, by Petition of Right... and the practice is for the Attorney General - on behalf of the King - to endorse the petition... and allow the case to come to court. It is interesting to note that the exact words he uses on such occasions are... "Let Right Be Done" "Let Right Be Done." I like that phrase, sir. It has a certain ring about it - hasn't it? "Let Right Be Done" Come in, Ronnie. Shut the door. This is my son Ronald. Ronnie, this is Sir Robert Morton. How do you do, sir? He is going to ask you a few questions. You must answer them all truthfully - as you always have. I expect you would like us to leave. No, provided, of course, that you don't interrupt. Do sit down. Well Ronnie, come over here with me. Will you stand at the table, facing me? That's right. Thank you. - How old are you? - Thirteen and four months. So you were twelve and ten months old when you left Osborne, is that right? Yes, sir. Now I would like you to cast your mind back to December 17th of last year. Will you tell me in your own words exactly what happened to you on that day. All right. Well, it was a half-holiday, so we didn't have any work after dinner. Dinner? At half past twelve? Yes, at least, until prep at seven. Prep at seven? Just before dinner, I went to the Chief Petty Officer... and asked him to let me have 15 shillings and 6 pence out of what I had in the college bank. Why did you do that? I wanted to buy an air pistol. - Which cost 15/6? - Yes, sir. How much money did you have in the school bank at the time? Two pounds three shillings. So you see, sir, what possible incentive could there be for him to steal five shillings? I must ask you to be good enough not to interrupt me, sir. Now Ronnie, after you had withdrawn the 15/6 what did you do? - I had dinner. - Then what? I went back to the locker-room and put the 15/6 in my locker. Yes. Then? I asked permission to go to the post office. I went back to the locker room, got out the money and went to the post office. Yes. Go on. - I bought my postal order. - With 15/6? Yes. Then I met Elliot minor. He said, "I say, isn't it rot? Somebody's broken into my locker and pinched a postal order." "I've reported it to the P.O". Those were Elliott minor's exact words? Well, he might have used another word for "rot". I see. Continue. Well then, just before prep I was told to go along and see Captain Flower. The woman from the Post Office was there, and the Captain said, "Is this the boy?"... and she said "It might be. I can't be sure. They all look so much alike". You see? She couldn't identify him. Go on, Ronnie Then she said: "I only know that the boy who bought a postal order for 15/6 ..." was the same boy that cashed one for 5 shillings." So the captain said ' Did you buy a postal order for 15/6?" And I said "Yes"... and then they made me write Elliot minor's name on an envelope... and compared it to the signature on the postal order. Then they sent me to the sanatorium and ten days I was sacked. - I mean - expelled. - Right. When the captain asked you to write Elliot's name on an envelope, how did you write it? With christian name or initials? - I wrote Charles K. Elliot. - Charles K. Elliot. Did you by any chance happen to see the forged postal order in the captain's office? Yes, the captain showed it to me. - Before or after you had written Elliot's name on the envelope? - After. After. And did you happen to see how Elliot's name was written on the postal order? Yes, sir. The same. - The same? Charles K. Elliot? - Yes, sir. When you wrote the name on the envelope, what made you choose that particular form? That was the way he usually signed his name. How did you know? - He was a great friend of mine. - That is no answer. How did you know? - I'd seen him sign things. - What things? Oh - ordinary things... - I repeat, what things? - Bits of paper. Bits of paper? Why did he sign his name on bits of paper? I don't know. You do know. Why did he sign his name on bits of paper? He was practising his signature. - And you saw him? - Yes. Did he know that you saw him? Well... yes. In other words, he showed you exactly how he wrote his signature. Yes, I suppose he did. Did you practise writing it yourself? - I might have done - What do you mean you might have done? Did you or did you not? Yes. Ronnie, you never told me that. - It was only for a joke. - Never mind whether it was for a joke or not. The fact is you practiced forging Elliot's signature,. - It wasn't forging. - What do you call it then? Writing. Very well. Writing. Whoever stole the postal order and cashed it also wrote Elliot's signature, didn't he? - Yes. - And oddly enough... in the exact form in which you had earlier been practising "writing" Elliot's signature. - I say, who's side are you on? - Quiet! Don't be impertinent! Are you aware that the Admiralty sent the postal order to Mr Ridgely-Pierce... the greatest handwriting expert in the country? - Yes. And you know that Mr Ridgely-Pierce affirmed that there was no doubt... that the signature on the postal order and the signature you wrote on the envelope... - ...were by one and the same hand? - Yes. - Yet you still say that you didn't forge that signature? - Yes, I do. In other words, Mr. Ridgely-Pierce doesn't know his job? Well he's wrong anyway. Now, when you went into the locker room after dinner, were you alone? - I do not remember. - I think you do. Were you alone in the locker room? - Yes. - And you knew which was Elliot's locker? Yes. Of course. - Why do you go in there at all? - I told you. To put my 15/6 away. What did you do after leaving the locker room? I told you. I went to get permission to go to the post office. What time was that? About 1:45. Dinner is over at 1:15, which means that you were in the locker room for half an hour. - I wasn't there all that time. - How long were you there? - About five minutes. - What were you doing for the other twenty five? I don't remember. It's odd that your memory is so good about some things and so bad about others. Perhaps I waited outside the C.O.'s office. Perhaps you waited outside the C.O.'s office! And perhaps no one saw you there either? No, I don't think they did. What were you thinking about outside C.O.'s office for 25 minutes? I don't even know if I was there. I can't remember. Perhaps I wasn't there at all. No! Perhaps you were still in the locker room rifling Elliot's locker - Sir Robert, I must ask you... - Quiet! I remember now. I remember. Someone did see me outside the C.O,'s office. A chap called Casey. I remember I spoke to him. - What did you say? - I said 'Come down to the post office with me. I'm going to cash a postal order'. - Cash a postal order? - I mean get. You said cash. Why did you say cash if you meant get? - I don't know! - I suggest cash was the truth. No, no! It wasn't. it wasn't really. You're muddling me. You seem easily muddled. How many other lies have you told? - None. Really I haven't - I suggest your whole testimony is a lie. No! It's the truth. I suggest there is barely one single word of truth in anything you have said either to me... or to the Judge Advocate or to the Captain! I suggest that you broke into Elliot's locker... that you stole the postal order for 5 shillings belonging to Elliot... that you cashed it by forging Elliot's name! No, no. I didn't.. Furthermore, I suggest that by continuing to deny your guilt... you are causing great hardship to your own family... and considerable annoyance to high and important persons in this country. - That's a disgraceful thing to say! - I agree I suggest that the time has at last come for you to undo some of the misery you have caused.. By confessing to us all now... that you are a forger, a liar, and a thief! I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! I didn't do it -. This is outrageous! I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Can I give you a lift? My car is at the door. No, thank you. Well, send all this stuff round to my chambers tomorrow morning, will you? But - will you need it now? Need it? Of course. The boy is plainly innocent. I accept the brief. Good night. Curry and Curry 55 pounds, 13 shillings and 4 pence. All together: 627 pounds, 3 shillings and 2 pence. The solicitor's bills alone amount to 324 pounds... Not a monetary reserve. Now there Winslow, I never thought the time would come when I should have to speak like this to you of all people. You, who sat in that chair for ten years offering sound advice on core common sense. But I must point out that your overdraft is well over the agreed limit. And you have no further securities, have you? I'm afraid that if you really intend to proceed with this case, you'll be making things very uncomfortable for yourself You have to cut down on every little expense absolutely ruthlessly. I know. My dear fellow. Take the advice of an old friend. Think twice before you waste another penny. Grazia, signore. Dickie! I want to ask you a question. But before I do so... I must impress on you the urgent necessity for an absolutely truthful answer Naturally. Naturally means "by nature"... and I've not yet noticed that it has invariably been your nature to answer my questions truthfully. Oh. Well I will, this one. Father, I promise. Very well. What do you say one of your bookmaker friends... would be prepared to lay in the way of odds against your getting a degree? You don't want to have a bet, do you? No, Dickie. I'm not a gambler. And that's exactly the trouble. I'm no longer in a position to gamble 200 a year... on an outside chance. Not an outside chance, Father. A good chance. Not good enough, Dickie. With things as they are at the moment. Definitely not good enough. I fear my mind is finally made up. You want me to leave Oxford - is that it? I'm afraid so, Dickie. I can get you a job in the bank. Oh, Lord! Father, if I promised you that from now on I'll... I mean... Isn't there any way? Oh Lord. I'm afraid this has been rather a shock for you, Dickie. What? No. No, it isn't really, I've been rather expecting it as a matter of fact... especially since I've heard you managed to brief Sir Robert Morton. Still, I can't say but what it isn't a bit of a slap in the face.. I must thank you Dickie for bearing what must have been a bitter blow with some fortitude. - It was a grand day, don't you think that? - Most enjoyable. - Fine sit, old man? - Heavenly. Ah, my dear Morton, the very man I wanted to see. Thank you First Lord, how's your game these days? Pretty good. I'm trying out a new grip. It's literally revolutionized my game. Literally? I'm glad to hear that. We must have a round sometime. Yes, we must. Now listen, Morton, you'll receive an official letter from us tomorrow... but I thought I'd like to let you know beforehand. I'm afraid we've had to turn down your Petition of Right in the Winslow case. - Indeed. - Yes, I advised the Attorney General to do so. The last occasion in which a Petition of Right was demurred to... was in the reign of William and Mary. This matter is not so unimportant as you appear to imagine.. Unimportant? To allow Winslow to sue us in the person of the King would raise a most dangerous precedent. Come now, my dear fellow. I advise you to drop this senseless flummery... for your own sake, as well as for ours. Something tells me you may hear a great deal more of this "senseless flummery". Now, when shall he have our round? Just you wait and see Do not be impatient. Just wait and see. Answer in regard to his policy: "He says wait and see." He says wait and see. Now then, any other topics? What's that, madame? Ay? The suffragettes? With pleasure, madame. Here goes. Just you wait and see... The suffragettes' s'posed to take Government peace. They want the franchise, no wonder a man's shy. But just wait and see. Just you wait and see. Now then, give me another topic. The Winslow boy! - What's that? - The Winslow boy! - The Winslow boy! - The Winslow boy! We must have that. Just you wait and see. Why Winslow was treated so shamefully Will they burn their boats at the Admiralty Just you wait and see. Really, the name of Winslow is becoming a nationwide laughing stock. Father! Everything all right? Yeah? - What's that? The aeroplanes! - Yes sir. - Good night, madam. Good night Violet. - Good night, sir. Good night Violet. Have you spoken to her yet, Grace? No dear. Not yet. I'm sure if you explain our position to her, even show her the figures I jotted down for you yesterday... she'll understand. I don't mind how many figures she's shown. She's been with us so long. It's a brutal thing to dol. Facts are brutal things. Facts? I don't think I know what facts are these days. The facts are, at the moment, are that we have half the income a year ago, and we're living at nearly the same rate. - That's bad economics. - I'm not talking about economics. I'm talking about ordinary, common or garden facts. Things we took for granted a year ago and which now don't seem to matter anymore. - Such as? - Such as peace and quiet and an ordinary respectable life... and some sort of future for us and our children. A happy home, Arthur. A happy home. But you've thrown all that overboard. I can only pray to God that you know what you're doing. I know exactly what I'm doing, Grace. I'm going to publish my son's innocence before the world. You talk about sacrificing everything for him... but when he's grown up he won't thank you for it, Arthur... even though you've given your life to - Publish his innocence, as you call it. Yes, Arthur. Your life. You talk gaily about arthritis and a touch of gout and old age and the rest of it... but you know as well as any of the doctors what really is the matter with you.. You're destroying yourself, Arthur... and me and your family. And for what, I'd like to know?,. For what, Arthur? For justice, Grace? Are you sure it isn't just plain pride and self-importance... and sheer brute stubbornness? John? Do you really want to marry me? What? Do you really want to marry me? But of course I do. You know I do. I mean, we've been engaged for over a year now. - Have I ever wavered? - No, never before. But I'm not wavering now. Not a bit. - It's just... - Hi, Kate. Hello, John. Good night, Kate. Good night, John. Good night, Dickie. - Trouble between you and John? - Not really. - I say, you're not going to be left on the altar rail on your mind? - I'll get him past the altar rail if I have to drag him there. Do you think you might have to? Might have to. Yes.. - It's the case I suppose. - In a way. I could just about murder that little brother of mine. What's he have to go about pinching postal orders for? Why the dickens did he get himself nabbed doing it? Good night, Dickie. Silly little blighter! Goodnight, Mother. Goodnight, Father. Father! You ought to be in bed. - Kate, are we both mad? - What's the matter, father? Oh, I do not know. Suddenly I feel suicidally inclined. Should we drop the whole thing, Kate? I do not consider that a serious question, Father. You realize that if go on, your marriage settlement will have to go? Oh, I gave that up for lost weeks ago. As a matter of fact, I've been thinking of trying to get some paid work. What could you do? I could do some good. Things are all right between you and John, aren't they? Yes, father. Of course. Everything's perfect. I mean - this won't make any difference between you? Of course not. Very well... Weeks go by and nothing happens. Good shot. - A trifle pulled. Yes - Five iron. - I'm most interested to see this new grip of yours. - Oh. It's so simple my dear fellow. Watch. Oh, by the way, I meant to ask you - that Winslow case. I'm so sorry. - Oh. Did I put you off? - No, not at all. - What about the Winslow case? - What does the Government intend to do about it? - Nothing, I told you. - I should have thought the very least they could have a debate about it in the House. A debate is out of the question. Nonetheless. I intend to press for one. - You'd be wasting your time. - Time doesn't worry me. "The Winslow Boy debate today" A fine old rumpus that is, sir, and no mistake. As you say, Violet, a fine old rumpus. The was a lovely bit about it in my paper, sir. How it was about a fuss about nothing... and a shocking waste of the government's time. But how it was a good thing all the same because it could only happen in England. There seems to be a certain lack of logic in that argument. Well, they might have put it a bit different, sir. Still, that's what it said all right. And when you think it's all because of our Master Ronnie... I have to laugh about it sometimes. I really do. Wasting the government's time at his age. I never did. Well, wonders will never cease. As you say, wonders will never cease. Violet... How long have you been with us? Twenty-four years come April, sir. - As long as that? - Yes sir. Miss. Kate was that high when I first came. And Mr. Dickie hadn't even been thought of. I remember your coming to us now. I remember it very well. Things are a bit different now, aren't they, sir? Mr. Dickie living all on his own in Reading. Miss Kate getting married. It's no good shirking the fact, Kate. The old man's pretty worked up about this debate. Yes that's how a lot of people feel. I am, for one. Yes, but he doesn't see why there should be a debate at all. I must say, that a European war blowing up... there's a coal strike on, there's a fair chance of a civil war in Ireland... it does seem a bit odd that the House of Commons should have to take a whole day... to discuss your young brother and his bally postal order. Well, all I can say is, John... that if the day ever comes that the House of Commons has so much on its mind that it can't find time to discuss a Ronnie Winslow... and his bally postal order... well this country will be a far poorer place than it is now. I wish I could see this in your light, Kate. I know it's awfully important for you to establish Ronnie's innocence. That's not important to me, John. - It's not? - It's important to my father, not to me. All that I care about is that people should know... that a government department has ignored a fundamental human right... and that it should be forced to acknowledge it. That's all that's important to me. And it is - terribly important. Kate! Kate! It's time we were going. All right, father. I'm ready. Three more reporters outside, sir. Want to see you very urgently. Shall I let them in? Certainly not. I made a statement yesterday. Until the debate is over I have nothing more to say. Yes sir. That's what I told them, but they wouldn't go. Well make them. If necessary, use force. Yes, sir. Are you quite sure you're well enough to go? Nothing to say. Nothing to say. I did it! With this lot around, I almost forgot. Came in just now, sir. Open it for me, Kate. What is it? Give me that letter, Kate. No, father. Not now. The case. This must be the end. No, father. We've got to go on.. It's not just this letter. I can't go on sacrificing other peoples' happiness. We'll talk about it on the way. - What is the motion? - Reduce the First Lord's salary by 10. Capital idea! Capital! But what's all the fuss about? Oh some jiggery pokery of that fellow Morton's to discredit the government. Can't abide the fellow! Vicious sort of devil. Do you have the Times? Where's the Times? Here it is... There's a gentleman to see you sir. A Mr. Winslow. Thank you. Sir Robert, whatever the result of the debate may be, I must ask you to drop this case. - What has happened? - I have made many sacrifices for it. Some I had no right to make. Nonetheless I made them. - But there is a limit, and I have reached it. - What has happened? I'm sorry, Sir Robert. More sorry than you, perhaps... but the Winslow case is closed. Balderdash! My father doesn't mean what he has been saying, Sir Robert. - I think I should tell you that we've had a letter.. - No, Catherine. From the father of the man I'm engaged to... saying that if we go on with the case he'll use every influence he has... to prevent his son from marrying me. I see. An ultimatum. Yes, but a pointless one. He has no influence over his son? A little, of course, but John's of age and his own master. I see. Well sir? I can't go back on anything that I have already said. Your daughter seems prepared to take the risk. How do you estimate the risks, Miss. Winslow? Negligible. I must apologise, sir, for speaking to you as I did just now. It was unforgivable. Not at all. You were upset at giving up the case. And to be frank, I liked you for it. The House of Commons is a peculiarly trying place, you know. Too little ventilation and far too much hot air I'm really am most awfully sorry. Please. That's a most charming hat, Miss. Winslow! I'm glad you like it. It seems decidedly wrong to me that a lady of your political persuasion... should be allowed to adorn herself with such a truly feminine allurement.. It looks awfully like trying to have the best of both worlds. Yes, but then I'm not a militant, you know, Sir Robert. I don't go about throwing bricks through shop windows or making speeches from soap boxes. I'm very glad to hear it. Both those activities would be highly unsuitable in that hat. Well I hope that what my father has said will not prevent you from making your speech, Sir Robert. After all, the principle is still involved. What principle? The principle of right and wrong. Oh, quite. Quite.. Excuse me, Sir Robert. The debate has started. Mr. Hamilton is on his feet. Thank you. Excuse me. I must thank you, Sir Robert, for all you have done for us.. I hope you don't blame me but I must confess to a certain feeling of relief... that after today we shall hear no more about the Winslow Boy. Oh. You really think so? Harris has a duty to his constituents. How can I be expected to pay this man when I know about his feelings... about the bureaucrats in charge of a government department? Well he has been, to coin a phrase, bludgeoned and obstructive at every step. The high-handed attitude of the government... in trying to prevent the Winslow case from coming before the court... on the grounds of the immunity of the Crown... is indefensible. How else can First Lord explain... those petty-fogging devices... and mounting demerit... in reply to my repeated requests... is nothing more and nothing less than justice? In the light of my vast experience of government departments... I never known a more heart-rending example of indifference to the great principles of British justice. Will the right honourable gentleman please consider his position... for the sake of their own reputation... as well as for the paramount reason... never was a English boy... submitted to treatment so cruel. I see around the front bench of the Government... And what do I see? Despots. You may laugh. But how else any right-thinking person describe the callous - nay inhuman - conduct .. Of the Admiralty? The honourable member for Wimbledon has made great play with his elegant references to despotism and justice. But I should like to point out that the Admiralty... during this long drawn-out dispute... has at no time acted hastily or inadvisably... and it is a matter of mere histrionic hyperbole... for the honourable to characterise the conduct of my department as inhumane... and allowed them to deliver malice towards the boy Winslow. Such unfounded accusations I can well choose to ignore. - What about the Petition of Right? - He should have the same opportunity as anyone else. This criticism against the Admiralty... appears to stem from a purely legal question of Petition of Rights... brought by Mr. Arthur Winslow... and the Admiralty's demur thereto. There is no doubt whatever in my mind .. That in certain cases... advice may have to be sacrificed for the public good. And moreover... His Majesty's government cannot be and will not be expected to yield to threats... or eloquent gestures from any source whatsoever! Morton, why on earth didn't you speak? My dear Hamilton, the House is in no mood to listen to reason. But aren't you going to speak at all? Are you all right, Father? Yes, why? So much for right and wrong. So much for Sir Robert Morton. Well my dear, I did rather stay down, didn't I? Yes father, that's not the point. The point is, he didn't make a speech. He got out of it in a most magnificently dramatic way. I admired the theatrics. If I hadn't known I could have sworn he was really indignant. Of course he was genuinely indignant. So would any man of feeling be. Sir Robert, father dear, is not a man of feeling. I don't think any emotion at all can stir that fishy heart. Except perhaps a single-minded love of justice. A single-minded love of Sir Robert Morton. - Well, what's happening? - Admiral Westmacott's still on his feet... still saying precisely nothing. So the debate continues. - Why, Sir Robert! - Yes? I've never seen you smoke before. Oh, yes. I do sometimes. On very special occasions. Here's the latest one. - Anything in it? - No. The debate continues. That will be John. My dad just told me about his letter. I'm awfully sorry. - I hope you don't think... - Look, darling, it's perfectly all right. - I know you had nothing to do with it. - I must say, it was pretty high-handed of the old man. - High-handed? - I told him so, too. - We had quite a row about it. - Darling. The awful thing is he practically said it. If your father decides to go on with the case... he'll do everything he threatens. But, aren't they rather empty threats, John? Well, you see, darling... there's always the allowance. Yes. I see... there's always the allowance. What's your father going to do? Throw up the case. Oh my darling. I am so glad. I knew nothing so trivial and stupid could possibly come between us. With the barricades going up this week in Dublin this very minute... the whole country trembling under the threat of civil war... you waste the whole day, on what? Morton's up. - Who's up? - Morton. I must hear this. What has this puny little affair of a 14-year-old schoolboy... and the alleged theft of the paltry sum of 5 shillings... What has this to do with such grave matters as our rights and liberties? What indeed! What has that to do with our rights and liberties? Only this! Once allowed through indifference, one act of injustice,... ... and by degrees, the slow poison of indifference, by being convenient... may cripple and destroy those rights and liberties. - Yes. - Yes. It matters not whether the Winslow case is about a 14 year old schoolboy... or the oldest pensioner in the kingdom... or the most distinguished of the right honourable gentlemen opposite. Which of the distinguished gentleman opposite? It matters not if the sum involved is 5 shillings, 5 pence... or the fiftieth part of the smallest fraction of a farthing. It matters not one single jot. For the case of the Winslow Boy is none of these. - What is it? - Yes! It is not Winslow's guilt or Winslow's innocence that concerns us now. It is something greater by far, for the case of the Winslow Boy is none of these. It is Winslow's right as a common citizen of England, to be heard. To be heard in defence of his honour... so wantonly pitched into the mire... because of this monstrous assumption by His Majesty's government. This medieval and monstrous assumption... that the King can do wrong. And to maintain the common rights of Winslow against the King... I will fight to the last breath in my body... and the last drop of my blood. And I believe, with all my heart, that this house will accept my view... that there is only one course left open to the government. Namely this... let them not rest... until the Attorney General has endorsed Mr. Winslow's petition... with the time-honoured phrase... the phrase that has always stirred an Englishman... the manner, always will be that... wherever he may be... in his castle... in his backyard... or in the humblest little public house at the corner of the humblest street... "Let right be done." Well said, Robert Morton! The Admiralty administration cannot go back on a decision it has already taken. I have nothing more to say. Damn disgrace about English justice! That's not an answer! That's not an answer! Let right be done? Impossible. Are you sure - absolutely sure - that you've considered every aspect of the situation? I have. This is grave news. Grave news, indeed. Sir Robert must have been bitterly disappointed. After all, he has put his whole heart and soul into the case. My dear Desmond, Sir Robert has no heart and no soul. The man is a fish. A hard, cold blooded, sneering, supercilious fish. Sir Robert Morton. - Something gone down the wrong way? - Yes. - May I assist? - Thank you. Good evening, sir. I thought I would call and give you an account of the day's proceedings. - May we offer you some refreshment, Sir Robert? A whiskey and soda? - No thank you. We admired your exit. It was magnificent. Very good of you to say so. It's a very old trick, you know. I've done it many times in the courts. It's nearly always surprisingly effective. I don't think you've met my fiance, John Watherstone. Sir Robert Morton. - No I haven't. How do you do, sir? - Congratulations delayed. May I offer you my very belated congratulations. How delicious. May I help myself? Thank you. There has been a most surprising development in the House, sir. A certain barrister who happened to be interested in the case... suddenly got up on his feet at about ten past nine... and delivered one of the most scathing denunciations of a government department ever heard in the House. His style was quite superb. What a pity you missed it. - And the debate? - The debate, of course, revived... and the First Lord suddenly found himself under attack from all parts of the House. Rather than risk a division... he has given an undertaking that he will instruct the Attorney General to endorse our Petition of Right. The case of Winslow against the King, therefore, can now come to court. Well, sir, does your decision still stand? The decision, sir, is no longer mine. - You must ask my daughter. - What are my instructions, Miss Winslow.? Do you need my instructions, Sir Robert? Aren't they already on the Petition? Doesn't it say...:.. Let Right Be Done.? Kate! Very well, then. We must endeavour to see that it right is done. Silence! - Who's that? - That's the new Lord Chief Justice. Winslow against the King. If it please your lordship, and members of the jury. This is a bill of rights brought by Mr. Arthur Winslow... of Balmoral Avenue, Wimbledon... claiming damages for the unlawful expulsion of his son... Ronald Arthur Winslow, from the Royal Naval College, Osborne... and breach of contract by the Admiralty. In their defence, the defendants deny any breach of contract. They contend that they had a discretion in the matter... which has been duly exercised... that the supplicant's son had been guilty of misconduct... and also demurred to the Petition of Right... which has been granted, and is now before this Court. May it please your lordship, and members of the jury... in this case, in which my learned junior, Mr. Saunders has openly issued to you... I appear with him and Mr. Harris, for the plaintiff... and defence is represented by the learned friend the Attorney General, Mr. Simmons and Mr. Burns. Before I begin, I think I should tell your Lordship... in view of the very exacting nature of this case... and the fact that it is, I understand, likely to last as many as four or more days... that it is possible that I may, at some later stage, have to beg for an adjournment. Indeed, Sir Robert, and why, sir? I have not been in the best of health, lately, my Lord... and although I do cannot expect my health be a matter of urgent moment to my learned friend... I may have to beg his kind consideration should it, at a later stage, fail. Milord and gentlemen of the Jury, Nearly two years ago... on December 17, Cadet Ronald Arthur Winslow was summoned to his commanding officer's room. Hold the Testament in your right hand and repeat after me: I swear by almighty God, that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. You said, I think, that your relations with the boy Elliot were very friendly. Yes, sir, they were. - Now at dinner time, you sat next to Elliot. - Yes, sir. - What did you talk about? - Well, Elliot was telling me how old Fluffy... I mean, Captain Flower... had given him an awful time in navigation class that morning. Winslow Boy in Witness Box! Winslow case! Read all about it! - Here you are, Kate. - Thank you, mother. No coffee for you, Ronnie. Violet is going to bring you up some nice hot milk. - And off to bed with you, my boy. - Not yet, father. Certainly. You face the Attorney General again tomorrow. You'll need all your wits about you. Such as they are. Oh that's all right. The old boy can't crack a ' ...'. Don't '... ' until you're out of the woods. - Take him to bed, Grace. - Come on, darling. Good evening, Father. Have you seen the Times today about John's engagement, father? Yes, Kate, I'd hoped you hadn't seen it. Oh. It was to be expected, you know. As Desmond would say, half expected. Still, seeing it like that in cold print, it was rather... I'm sorry, Kate. I met her once, as a matter of fact. She is a general's daughter. Most suitable. - Come on, father up to bed, too. - Ah, wait a minute. I think Ronnie did well today, don't you? Yes, but I'm not quite as content as the Attorney General appeared yesterday. So you admit at last for at least half an hour, on December 17, two years ago... you were entirely alone in the locker room. I don't know if it was a half hour. I would say it was more like ten minutes. Perhaps your arithmetic isn't as good as it should be. What is 15 from 45? 15 from 45... 15 from 45... Yes, 15 from 45. I would be interested how you make it 10. Come now, what is it? - My lord - - I must protest about these constant interruptions. My learned friend seems remarkably impatient with witness this morning. Perhaps the heat in the courtroom is partly responsible. I find it rather t No doubt we all do, Sir Robert. What do you wish to say? Merely that the relevance of my learned friend's last question is a little disputable. I feel fairly confident that this court will be prepared to accept the fact... that 15 from 45 is 30 and not 10. But my client's skill, or lack of it, at arithmetic seems to me to have very little bearing... on whether or not he stole five shillings. My lord, it must be plain to the meanest intelligence what the purpose of my question was. As the possessor of that meanest intelligence to which my learned friend referred... may I say that the purpose of the question was as clear to me as daylight! It was to browbeat my client... by introducing to this court the atmosphere of a viva voce examination! Milord, I most emphatically protest! Sir Robert, that observation was certainly uncalled for. You are prejudicing your case by these interruptions. Oh... Do you really think so, my lord? As your Lordship pleases. Continued. Thank you, Milord. I am nearly finished. Now young man. At 1:15 you went into the locker room alone. At 1:45 you went to ask permission to go down to the village. - Is that right? - Yes, sir. - That leaves half an hour. Doesn't it? - Yes, sir. Plenty of time to break open a locker and rifle its contents. - I didn't do that! - Plenty of time to forge a name on a postal order. - I do not... - A name that you had already practised forging. - I didn't -. - Plenty of time to slip it in your pocket... and go brazenly to your C.O and ask for permission to go down to the village and cash it. - That isn't true! - And if it isn't true... why did you lie to the captain about the time you spent alone in the locker room? All right. Thank you Ronnie. That is all. Now Ronnie. You've had quite an ordeal the past few days, haven't you? - Yes, sir. - Well I won't keep you much longer. I just want to ask you one more question. Only one. When you'd finished your smoke, What did you do with your cigarette end? - Put it into your pocket? - No. On top of the locker... Oh! - I see... Thank you, Ronnie. That's all. The court is adjourned. The court is adjourned until 10:30 tomorrow morning. Gosh, how did you know that? It's my business to know these things. Sir Robert, this will make all the difference to the case, won't it? On the contrary. I didn't want to bring it up at all if I could possibly have avoided it. The Attorney General will say that a boy who is capable of breaking one of the strictest college rules by smoking... is more likely than not to have broken another by stealing five shillings. - But the jury, surely... - If I know the Attorney General at all... will tell firmly tell the jury that a verdict for Ronnie... will simultaneously cause mutiny in the Royal Navy and triumphant jubilation in Berlin. Catherine, your father's ill. - Father! - Promise me you won't come to court tomorrow. The verdict certainly won't come through until the day after tomorrow. Promise me you'll stay at home. Come along, dear, we'll get back home. - Hey. You that Winslow boy? - No, I'm the brother. - Wait a minute, our American readers want to know... - What is your profession, Winslow? - I'm a banker. - A banker, what are your views on this case? I don't know I have any. Except, I mean, I hope we win and all that. - Were you in court? - No. I just came from Reading. - Reading? - That's where I work. I came up for the last two days of the trial. - What's your brother like? - Quite an ordinary sort of kid just like any other, makes a noise... - Does fretwork, doesn't wash... - Doesn't what ...? Doesn't wash. I say, don't take that too literally. I mean he does, sometimes. Nobody in. - Hello, Dickie! - Hello, Mother. Extra! Winslow Boy latest! Read all about it! Winslow Boy - new witness! Read all about it! Winslow Boy - new witness! Captain Flower... at this inquiry at the college, Cadet Winslow was given every chance to defend himself? - Certainly. - And after hearing all the evidence, what conclusion did you come to? - That he was guilty. - Beyond the faintest shadow of a doubt? - Yes sir, beyond the faintest shadow of a doubt. - Thank you. I thought you said, sir, that in this preliminary inquiry at Osborne... as a result of which Cadet Winslow was branded as a forger and a thief... I think you said that the boy had every chance to defend himself. Yes, sir. That is so. Tell me, Captain, Have you ever been court martialled. - Milord, I protest most strenuously! - I agree. - You don't have to answer that question. - But I'm quite ready to. Yes sir. I was court martialled once about... about 25 years ago. What was the charge? Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Indeed. What more specific conduct was that? Stealing a policeman's helmet in Portsmouth. Speak up, please. Stealing a policeman's helmet in Portsmouth. I see - and what was the result of the court martial? - I was acquitted. - I'm delighted to hear it. How old were you then, Captain? About 22... I think. And you conducted your own defence, I suppose? No, I had accused's friend. Oh, you had accused's friend? A fellow officer to defend you. And at his inquiry, did Ronald Winslow have anyone to defend him? - That was different. - Different? Ah, yes, of course it was different. You were a man of 22, but he was a child of 13. Thank you, Captain. That is all. You were quite positive, Mr. Ridgeley-Pierce, that the handwriting was that of Ronald Winslow? Quite positive. And you arrived at that conclusion with the aid of every available scientific device... and after a lifetime's study of handwriting? I did. You said, I think, Mr. Ridgeley-Pierce, that you used every available scientific device... in identifying this handwriting? - Yes, that is so. Now you must have been called the greatest handwriting expert in the country. Haven't you? That is very good of you. I daresay I have. So naturally, you used the Schwutzbacher system. - What system? - The Schutzbacher system. You use it, of course. I'm afraid, I've never heard of it. Never heard of it? Never heard of the Schwutzbacher system? No. What is it? You are not cross-examining me, Mr. Ridgeley-Pierce, I am cross-examining you. What system, then, do you use? My own system. The Ridgely-Pierce system. Oh, the Ridgely-Pierce system, of course. That was the system you used in the Madison murder case, wasn't it? Yes, that is so. You gave evidence that Madison had written a certain letter... in a disguised hand confessing to the murder. - Yes. - Why, then, was Madison acquitted? Because the jurors were idiots. Oh - idiots were they? Because they disagreed with you and saved an innocent man from the gallows? No, I mean... And this jury... should they disagree with you too, and save an innocent boy from the... waging a young innocent... stigma of forger and thief... Would you call them idiots, as well? - No, I didn't mean... - That is all, Mr. Ridgely-Pierce. Now, Miss. Hawkins, how long have you been postmistress at Osborne? 23 years. Of course, I started very young. I can see that. Miss. Hawkins, I'm going to ask you to answer a simple and straightforward question. Are you quite, quite positive... that the boy who bought the postal order for fifteen and six... also cashed the postal order for 5 shillings? Yes, quite positive. I see. Had you any particular reason for noticing him? If there was - Well, I thought he was such a nice-looking little boy. Would you say exceptionally nice-looking? Better looking than, say, the boy Elliot? - My lord, I consider that question... - My lord, I insist the question be answered! - Proceed, Sir John... - Milord. The jury has to decide an issue of fact! - Not act as judges of a beauty competition! - I will have... Milord, it is truly neither right nor proper for my esteemed... Perhaps you had better leave me to decide what is right and proper, Sir Robert. I have had occasion to reprimand you before. I must warn you for the last time that you must not presume on the patience of the court. As your lordship pleases. Perhaps this might be an opportune moment to adjourn. The court is adjourned until two o'clock. - Are you alright, sir? - Yeah, all right. Morton, what you and I both need is a glass of good sherry wine. I suppose next you're going to ask for a postponement on the ground of ill health, ay, you sly dog? - Desmond... - Don't go, Kate, I want to speak to you. I have a matter of some urgency to communicate to you.. - Yes? - The fact of the matter is, Kate, I have a question to put to you... which, if I had refrained from putting until after the verdict... you might have thought - who knows... was prompted by pity, if we lose it, or... if we win, your reply might - again who knows... have been affected by gratitude. Do you follow me, Kate? Yes, Desmond, I think I do. Then possibly you have an inkling of what the question is I have to put to you? Yes, I think I have. Oh, you have. I am glad you have guessed. It makes my task the easier. You see, Kate, I know what your feelings for me really are. - You do, Desmond? - Yes, Kate. I know that they've never amounted to more than - shall we say, friendliness. A warm friendliness, I hope. Yes, I think we can definitely say, warm. When I was younger it might have been a different story, perhaps. When played cricket for England... perhaps even that wouldn't have made any difference. My athletic prowess is fading, I'm afraid... with the years and the stiffening of the joints... But my love for you will never fade. That's very charmingly said, Desmond. Don't make fun of me, Kate, please. I meant every word I said. Whatever you may feel, or not feel for me, whatever you may feel for anybody else. I want you to be my wife. Thank you. Can you give me a few days to think it over? Of course, of course. I need hardly tell you how grateful I am, Desmond. There's no need. Really, there's no need. Well, I must go and see Sir Robert. Strange man, that. At times, so cold and distant and... But what an actor! Almost convinced me that he believed what he was saying... until I saw him go out with the Attorney General after. You're wrong, Kate. He has a passion for this case. A real passion. I happen to know. Of course, this mustn't go any further... but I know that he has made a very very great personal sacrifice... to bring this to court. Sacrifice? What? Another brief? No. That is no sacrifice to him. No. He was offered - but you must really promise not to say a word. Come Desmond. What was he offered? The appointment of Lord Chief Justice. Lord Chief Justice? Yes. He turned it down simply in order to be able to carry on with the case of Winslow against The King. Strange are the ways of men, are they not? - Goodbye, my dear. - Goodbye, Desmond. Oh, no, dear. You mustn't do that. It annoys the exchange. I'd rather annoy the exchange than have the exchange annoy me. Catherine's late. Perhaps they're taking the lunch interval later today. Lunch interval? This isn't a cricket match. Nor, may I say, is it a matinee at the Gaiety Why are you wearing that highly unsuitable headdress? Don't you like it, dear? I thought it was one of Mme Dupont's best. Grace, dear - your son is facing charges of theft and forgery. It's so difficult! I simply can't be seen in the same old hat, day after day.. I tell you what, Arthur. I'll wear my black coat and skirt tomorrow - for the verdict. Mother, you can't you get rid of those reporters? Hello, Dickie. You came to be in at the death? - Is that what it's going to be? - Looks like it. I could cheerfully strangle that old brute of a judge. He's dead against us. - Is the crowd bigger than yesterday, Kate? - Yes, mother. Far bigger. We're gonna be late. I wonder if Violet will remember to pick up those onions? Perhaps I'd better do it on the way back from the court. Now, Dickie, when you get to the front door put your head down, like me, and charge through them all. I always shout: ' I'm the maid and don't know nothing... I've been a fool, father. Have you, my dear? An utter fool. In the absence of any further information, I can only repeat: "Have you, my dear?" - There can be no further information. I'm under a pledge of secrecy. - Oh? - Desmond's ask me to marry him. - I trust the folly you were referring to wasn't the acceptance of him? No. Would it be such folly though? - Lunacy. - Oh, I don't know. He's nice, and he's doing very well as a solicitor,. Neither very compelling reasons for marrying him. - Seriously - I shall have to think it over - Think it over, by all means. But decide against it. I'm nearly thirty, you know. That isn't the end of a life. It might be... for an unmarried woman, with not much looks. - Rubbish. - No, father. It's quite simple. Either I marry Desmond and settle down into quite a comfortable... and not really useless existence... or go on for the rest of my life earning 2 a week... addressing envelopes in the service of a hopeless cause. A hopeless cause? I've never heard you say that before. I've never felt it before. Poor Kate. I've messed up your life haven't I? No, father. Any messing-up that's been done has been done by me. I'm so sorry, Kate. So sorry. Don't be, father. We both knew what we were doing. - Did we? - I think we did. Our motives have been so different - Yours and mine, Kate. Can we both have been right? I believe we can. I believe we have been. Brute stubbornness. A selfish refusal to admit defeat. That's what your mother says our motives are. Perhaps she's right. Perhaps that's all they've been. But perhaps brute stubbornness may not be such a bad quality in the face of injustice. If you could go back, father, and choose again - would your choice be different? Perhaps. I don't think so. I don't think so either, Kate. I still say we both knew what we were doing. And we were right to do it.. Thank you, Kate. You're not going to marry Desmond, are you? In the words of the Prime Minister, father: "Wait and see" - What's that boy shouting? - Only - Winslow Case -Latest. It didn't sound like 'Latest' to me. Winslow Case Result! Result? There must be some mistake. Oh, Miss Kate, what a shame you missed it! Just after they came back from lunch... and Mrs Winslow she wasn't there, nor Master Ronnie neither. The cheering and the shouting and the carrying on. You've never heard anything like it in all your life... and Sir Robert standing there at the table with his wig on crooked... and the tears running down his face... running down his face they were, and unable to speak because of the noise. Cook and me we did a bit of crying too, we just couldn't help it. It was lovely! We did enjoy ourselves. Then cook had her hat knocked over her eyes by the man behind and the cheering and waving his arms about something chronic... and we kept on cheering... and the judge kept on shouting... but it wasn't any good, because even the jury joined in... and some of them climbed out of the box to shake hands with Sir Robert... And outside in the street it was just the same - you couldn't move for the crowd... and you'd think they'd all gone mad the way they were carrying on. Some of them were shouting: "Good old Winslow!" and singing "For he's a jolly good fellow"... and cook had her hat knocked off again. Oh, it was lovely!! Well, sir, you must be feeling nice and pleased, now it's all over? Yes, Violet. I am. That's right. I always said it would come all right in the end, didn't I? Yes. You did. Congratulations, sir, I'm sure. Thank you, Violet. It would appear, then, that we've won. Yes, Father... it would appear that we've won. I would have liked to have been there. Sir Robert Morton! I thought you might like to hear the actual words of the Attorney General's statement... so I jotted it down for you, sir. I say now, on behalf of the Admiralty, that I accept the declaration of Ronald Arthur Winslow... that he did not write the name on the postal order... that he did not take it, and that he did not cash it... and that consequently he is entirely innocent of the charge that was... brought against him two years ago. I make that statement without any reservations of any description... intending it to be a complete acceptance of the boy's statements. Thank you, sir. I... It's difficult for me... to find the right words to say to you. Pray do not trouble yourself to search for them, sir. Let us take these rather tiresome and conventional expressions of gratitude for granted, shall we? Now, on the question of damages and costs... I fear we shall find the Admiralty rather niggardly. Please, sir - no further trouble - I beg you. This is all I have ever asked for. Nevertheless, I have every intention of... applying a slight but decisive spur... to the First Lord's posterior in the House of Commons. Father, I'm most awfully sorry. I didn't know anything was going to happen. - Where were you? - At the pictures. We won, didn't you, Sir Robert? Yes, Ronnie. We won. Sir, the gentlemen at the front door say please will you make a statement. They say they won't go away until you do. Very well, Violet. Thank you. Yes, sir. What shall I say? I hardly think it matters, Whatever you say will have little bearing on what they write. - Thank you. What shall I say, Kate? - You'll think of something, father. Hm, Well... No! I refuse to meet the press in this ridiculous chariot. - Get me my stick! - Father, you know what the doctor said - Get me my stick! Ronnie, come help me. How would this be? It is not my victory. It is the people who have triumphed - as they always will - over despotism. How does that strike you, sir? A trifle pretentious, perhaps? Perhaps, sir. I should say it, none the less. It will be immensely popular. Well, give me a minute, I'll think of something. Once the witness had been discredited, the Attorney General threw up the case. That's what we heard. But this morning you seemed so depressed. - Did I? - Yes. Would you mind if I sit down? - No... Are you feeling all right, Sir Robert? - Just a slight nervous reaction - that's all. Have you such a thing as a drop of brandy? - Yes, of course. - I have not been feeling myself for some time. I told the judge so, if you remember, but I doubt if he believed me. He thought it was a trick, I think. Thank you. What suspicious minds people have, haven't they? Yes... Thanks. Sir Robert... I have a confession and an apology to make to you. Dear lady - I am sure the one is rash and the other superfluous. I would far rather hear neither - I am afraid you must. It's a bigger problem for me to say it than to write it. I have entirely misjudged your attitude to this case... and if, because of that, I have ever seemed to you either rude or ungrateful... I am sincerely and humbly sorry. My dear Miss Winslow, you have never seemed either rude or ungrateful to me. And my attitude to this case has been the same as yours. A determination to win at all costs. And when you talk of gratitude, you must remember that those costs were nof mine... but yours. Weren't they also yours, Sir Robert? I beg your pardon? Haven't you too made a sacrifice for the case? The robes of that office would not have suited me. Wouldn't they? I must ask you never to divulge it to a living soul... and even to forget it yourself. Sir Robert... Why are you always at such pains to prevent people knowing the truth about you? - Am I, indeed? - You know you are. Why? - Perhaps because I do not know the truth about myself - That is no answer. My dear Miss. Winslow, are you cross-examining me? I guess I am. Why are you so ashamed of your emotions? Because, in my profession, I must necessarily distrust them. Cold, clear logic - and buckets of it - should be the lawyer's only equipment. Was it cold, clear logic that made you weep at the verdict today? I really must go. For he's a jolly good fellow... Do you think I could slip out the back door? Yes, of course. Through the garden gate. Well. Goodbye, Miss. Winslow. You still haven't answered my question. Very well, then, if you must have it. I wept today because right had been done. - Not justice? - No. Not justice. Right. It is easy to do justice - Very hard to do right. But right has been done. - Do you smoke? Of course you do. - I didn't know you did. I do sometimes... on very... very special occasions. - Still pursuing your feministic activities, Miss Winslow? - Oh, yes. Pity. It's a lost cause. How little you know women, Sir Robert. Goodbye. I doubt if we shall meet again. Oh, do you really think so? How little you know men... Miss. Winslow.
