If we go aground or anything happens, you're dead! In the bag! There's guns too! Castin, take that! Grab some ammo! The rest overboard! All of it? We can't let Chenco use it! Where are you taking me? Wherever you want! You must put me ashore ... so I can reach the native mission at Santa Rosalia Leave them alone! They'll be better off! No one'll force'em to work! Thanks to the missions ... many tribes have now heard the Word of God From their foremen's mouths! That's not our fault But they follow you everywhere! They really love you! I won't argue with you Put me ashore at once! I'm in command here Get that in your head and we'll be OK I serve only one master. You don't scare me! We'll see Castin, you're wrong to aid ... such scum! What else can I do? I was innocent and they set a price on my head! Don't you hear anything? Sounds like a motor! Any other boats around? The Turica Bamba army launch Then we must land fast! Grab all the supplies you can! That's enough! ... Let's go! The boat's drifting away! My suitcase is on it! Ya won't need it in the jungle The boat'll sink! It's not yours to dispose of! It's how I make my living! You won't be living long! Walk in front! Kill him? What's it to you? Don't kill me! Take all my money! And leave ya here to betray us! I know the jungle! You'll get lost! You'll starve! He knows the jungle inside out Walk in front with him! If he runs, kill him! Forward! Walk! You know the region. How far to Rio Mambuti? I don't know. It could be three days ... or twenty It depends on the jungle Which direction do we take? Due west. No doubt about that You make me laugh! ... How d'ya know where west is ... with all the detours we've made? Don't be silly! We follow the sun The sun! It's given you sunstroke! Look, honey! We must get out of this, one way or another I don't have to! Nobody's after me! I'm goin' to the river Out of the question! Nobody's gonna squeal to the soldiers At least, nobody who's alive. See? We're all together to the end And yet we agreed yesterday ... Come on! Once in France we'll have ... my seaside restaurant My seaside restaurant!' Ya old slob! Miserable fool! I'll never make it! It's all your fault! Lemme alone! You make me sick! You're old and ugly! Here's your nest-egg! That's right! I'm fed up! She's ruthless! Who asked for your opinion? But she's always underfoot! Is you song over yet? Keep quiet! Get some sleep. Tomorrow'll be a tough day Impossible! Get up! I can't sleep like this. Tomorrow I'll be worthless You'll sleep! His rest is in our interest Mine is to keep him here! Where could he go? I'll answer for him. Tie him in front Turn around! The bastard! The bastards had it all planned! They had supplies for a week! Let'em starve! I'll spoil their appetite! Let's see! They had a lot? I don't know what they took! We must set out quickly, Lieutenant! They may be out of the cavern Bring that! Let's go! Lieutenant, may I move off to the right and ... cut them off? No need! The river's their sole hope They can't come this way because of us They're in the forest. They'll never get out Bring that! That's all we needed! What happened? Stay near Papa! What's wrong? I twisted my ankle It's only a sprain Walk or it'll swell! I can't! Try! And Chenco? It's settled! The supplies? Get'em if ya can! What's wrong? I sprained my ankle Padre, that's how to do unto others! I'll pray to God to forgive you Let's waste no time! Come on! It hurts! Walk! You'll get over it Everybody can keep up ... except you! They've got pains too! Nothing! Ya said you'd bring back food What can I do? The leaves are too thick to see animals! I just fire at random! With a carbine! If only I had a hunting rifle! No one can walk without eating! We've no choice I can't go on! If we stop, we'll die here Maybe we should! Well? No clearings in sight! We'll never cross those high hills out there We will! We have to! In our shape ... What's wrong with all of you? Ya wanna die here? The bugs'll eat you alive! I don't care! Ya still think we'll make it? God has condemned us! Huh, Father? Let God alone! We'll all die alike! The innocent and guilty! Quiet! I don't wanna drag a sick man with us It's no good ... We'll never escape! God's already refused to feed us! Shark, what do we do? Try to find a way further south We must keep going! As long as we've strength enough to walk! Shark! Look! It's too damp! Here! It'll be good! How's the fire? It won't light! Not if you go at it like that! Gimme some twigs! It's sure not easy Everything's wet There's nothing drier? Try that! It's the same! Everything's rotten here! We're done for ... Done for! It'll happen to the others too! Sooner or later! Maria did nothing! Sit down! Animals're everywhere ... hunting and eating one another! We can't find a one! They only come out at night Daytime, they hide We're not used to hunting for breakfast! My friends, do you hear me? Maybe hunger's made me delirious I'm obsessed! Obsessed by the story of an egg! Soft-boiled eggs! It was when I was at the seminary I must tell you about it! I was in my second year of theology I recall the dining hall and ... its tables ... like it was yesterday! We were ten per table The seminarist who served was a fat boy He was a nice lad. He did everything correctly ... except each time we had soft-boiled eggs ... Four or five always disappeared There was no explaining it ... until the day we caught him eating them two by two ... on the way from the church to the dining hall I mean, from the kitchen to the dining hall Even so, he became the coadjutor in my home church My mother's name was Mary ... Hurt? Yes Get up. I'll help you Don't be mad at me for the other night I was feeling blue I'm not mad at you ... We're all guilty! None of us are without blame! Don't talk that way all the time! We'll have our restaurant! No! ... There'll be no restaurant! Nothing! Come on Castin! Lemme alone! Lemme alone! ... I'll go on alone! Look! It's not an old fire! It's still intact! It's hardly damp! People must be near! Then we're saved! Let's catch up with them! They'll help us! We don't know who they are They may be head-hunters ... or escaped convicts! Why expect the worst? They may be explorers. Men of good will! We'll try? Look for other traces! We lit this fire We've gone in a circle! If we stay here, we're done for! Let's go! Djin, come on! Keep trying! Lizardi, try to convince her! No, hope's all that kept her on her feet We must do something! I'm going on ahead. I won't die without fighting! I'll come! No, I won't leave them alone ... with this madman! One of us must stay here! You're right If I'm alive, I'll be back If we don't meet again ... I thought you were just ... a bandit! Djin, our miseries are over! Look! You'll see! No more bugs or forest! Get your strength back! We'll have to walk a ways! Where were you? Where'd you find all that? You wouldn't believe me! Eat first. You'll see later! We'd lost all hope God saved us miraculously! Thanks to you, Shark! Funny ... Some 50 people had to die to save us Are you sure we're saved? It looks like a lake! It must be Lake Tocochapa on the Rio Mambuti We've only one thing left to do Build a raft and float with the current ... till we meet a boat That's not all. We must fulfill our duty to the dead Come on, Castin! ... Come on! What ya starin' at? I'm ugly, huh? Ya don't look good I wanna thank you for everything I like you Me too ... ever since the first day You slept like a kid ... with your mouth open You proved it to me the first day Let's have a swim Jewelry ... Where'd you find them? Here ... I'll put them in a safe place ... so we can give them back later They're not yours, Maria They belong to the dead To the dead and their families! You're very bad to act this way! You can't have them! You've always liked it ... hurry, it's yours! What's wrong? What happened? Father Lizardi was mean to you! His watch! ... I don't understand! Don't be sad! We're saved! It's Brazil! Your papa? He's sick He'll get treatment once we arrive Anyway, I could take his place Like to have me as your papa? I like you very much! God's cursed us! He's punished us Don't talk like that! God makes His own decisions Till now, I've been lenient ... but no more! God alone knows who He'll punish or spare! God's justice will soon be heard! You're beautiful! A real lady! Look! A fortune! Where'd you find it? In the lake! Fifty-fifty! I found the plane! In fact it's for you! All of it! And the girls as well! I hadn't understood You're nice when ya want to No! ... It's just that we're both alike! We could get along together Like that? All at once? ... May I? Beauty for the beautiful No, not all of a sudden! I liked you at once But we got off to a bad start You were mad at me And for good reason! Walking in the forest, it came to me A woman? ... She's nothing without a man There! You're ready for a new life Beautiful, huh? We may have trouble with the priest because of that Let's beat it! The two of us! Yeah, sure! But we can't leave the girl! The girl? Don't think about her I want a man all to myself It's never happened before Getting sentimental? Don't you believe me? You don't trust me? Sure, I trust you I really love you, Shark It took me a while to see it I'm so happy ... that I want to cry! It's incredible! Hide, Lizardi! You'll get yourself killed! He'll kill us all! Stay with Maria! I'll get behind him! What for? To kill him! He's raving mad! Wait! Maybe I can calm him down I'll talk to him Castin! Don't shoot! ... I want to talk to you! You know me! Lizardi! I trust you! In God's name, I beg of you! Stay there! Don't move!
