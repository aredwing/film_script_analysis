You oughta buy me a new one. Beat it, I said! Cheapskate! Hello, mister. Albert Baker? Yes? Come in, friend. Come in. Don't worry. My secretary. You've, uh, brought the money? We're having coffee. Try a cookie. They're very good. It's lucky they sent you today. By tonight, this would've been on its way to Washington. That would've been just too bad for your boss, wouldn't it? Especially the little, uh, prescription? I'm even willing to forgive your boss that nasty little word "blackmail. " So then, here you are and... the money, please. They said he'd be alone. Hi, mister. Mister? I dropped my ball. Thanks. It was very nicely handled, my boy. I compliment you. Taught Mr. Baker a lesson in morality, didn't you? Ugly people, blackmailers. Only one way to pay them off. Won't you have a sundae? I'll have my cut, Johnson. I'm broke. Here's your end. No, I'm not through with that. Oh, lovely. Dainty but sculptured. I'll bet you read palms. I'm an expert. How'd you guess? I guessed. Oh. My client is most grateful. He must have plenty of lettuce. Who is he? Oh, he's very shy. I couldn't discuss him. Say, Johnson, what is your line, anyway? You're not a finger man. I'm shy too. Why, Mr. Gates! My name is not Gates. You mean, you're not Will Gates of Los Angeles? I'm not. I'm sorry. So annoying. Second time today. Peppermint? They're all 10s. You didn't expect a thousand ones, did you? Don't you trust me? Who trusts anybody? Direct from the bank, as I promised. Oh, I see your point, of course. If the bills were bad, you couldn't very well complain to the police, could you? I'm my own police. What do you mean? What would you do? First I'd find out who you're stoogin' for... the shy boy. Then I'd give him what I gave Baker. Don't! I... I can't stand violence. Then I'd whittle off a little of that blubber. Such a warped sense of humor. Oh, I forgot. A little gift from me. Orchestra seats to the best show in town. I oughta know. It cost me plenty. That's my one vice... backing leg shows. No, thanks. Go ahead, take your girl. You... must have a girl or a friend. Why? Live alone, work alone, eh? Raven, how do you feel when you're doing... this? I feel fine. Well... be good. Lieutenant Crane? Yeah? I'm Willard Gates, Nitro Chemical Corporation of Los Angeles. My firm wants to know what the police up here are doing, if anything, about the man who robbed our paymaster. They're working on it. He's been reported here in San Francisco. Don't they know that? Yes, of course they know it. That's why I'm on the case. I'm from the Los Angeles force, up here on my vacation until this happened. Well, I hope you can get some results. It's been a week since the robbery. The stolen bills are all new and all 10s. Why hasn't an arrest been made? I'll tell you why. The man may not even be here. All we can do is wait for him to pass one of those hot bills. If he does that, we've got him. I hope so. You know we're offering a reward? Yeah. 5,000 for a 20,000 bundle. It's kind of unusual. Is it? Well, it's just because... the president of our company is so upset over it. Well, it's his dough. Remember we want him, dead or alive... preferably the former after what he did to our paymaster. And quickly, too, or we'll go higher up. Go milk a duck! Five thousand dollars. Mmm. I could buy myself a farm, get a couple chickens and lay my own eggs. That's a neat trick if you can do it. Thanks. All right, Miss Graham. This is the gal. Have you ever seen the love lights In a lady's eyes And then suddenly watch it vanish away If there's trouble in your love life Well, my friend get wise For as we magicians would say Now you see it Now you don't It goes hocus-pocus Alagazam That's love Try to kiss her First she won't And then presto, chango fiddle-dee-dee You're hand in glove One moment she's making you see Canaries in the air Next moment instead of her heart The ace of spades is there Now you see it Now you don't Because hocus-pocus Lo and behold You get blinded by that moon of bright gold above That's love Now you see it Now you don't Because hocus-pocus Lo and behold You get blinded by that moon of bright gold above That's love Thank you, McGillicuddy. How ya been? She's terrific. Caught her act in St. Louis. Yes, very clever and very attractive. She's audience-proof. Gets 'em bug-eyed. Her fishing number's even better. Fit right into your Neptune Club. What do you say? By all means. Oh, Miss Graham! You're hired. Rehearse in Los Angeles tomorrow morning. He'll do the talkin'. I'm Willard Gates. I own the Neptune Club. There isn't a producer on the coast who doesn't know that I'm the perfect sucker. Your act is very charming. Thank you. I wonder if we two might have dinner together tomorrow night in Los Angeles. McGillicuddy? My manager says no. I don't like your manager. Well, I don't always take his advice. And people ask me why I back shows. Thank you, Mr. Fletcher, very much for digging her up. For 10%, I'd dig up my wife's mother. Well, uh, tomorrow night then. How was I? Okay. He's hooked. Come on, change your duds. We're late. Why don't you tell me what this is all about? Talk takes time. Hurry up. I'll be right back. If this is a snatch, don't take me over the state line. Miss Graham, Senator Burnett. Senator? So you're the mystery. No mystery about me. Just a hick lawyer the voters got stuck with. - Miss Graham get the job? - Yeah, and I think Gates is hooked. I shouldn't wonder. I am too. Now, Senator, I have a boyfriend. And she don't mean me. Well, good-bye. Do senators usually have conferences in automobiles? Hotels have walls and walls sometimes have Dictaphones. Oh. Know about my committee? Read the papers? Mm, movie columns, gossip columns, football. How about your history books? Remember Benedict Arnold? Sure. The first all-American heel. There's a handful of those heels in this country today. And they're powerful enough to sabotage our defense. We're trying to expose them. It's okay by me. My committee thinks Gates is one of them. Him? The nightclub angel? In the daytime, he's an executive at Nitro Chemical. In between times, he's been seeing men... that are suspected of being foreign agents. Yet our investigators can't turn up anything definite. - And that's where I come in? - Will you give it a try? Well, it isn't exactly like deciding to go to a beauty parlor. Ooh. Worried about the boyfriend? I don't know what he'll think when he sees me with four other fellas. I don't either. But if you go through with this, you can't tell anybody, not even him. What do I do? Can I show you somethin'? How much? $8.98. Isn't it beautiful? It's one of our best numbers. What size you lookin' for? I've got all si... A girl named Annie will be down for it. Give her the change. Mama. Mama! Mama, I just made a sale. The dress in the window to a man! Can you imagine? That dress? Hey, Mama. Mama, the number. Oh, Mama. I feel sick. Are you sure? Look. Come on! Come on, folks! I'll be about five minutes. If you need me, honk. Right. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Over here. Step up! Play the scale. Eight shots, 10 cents. Win a carton of cigarettes. Come on, step up! Hi, angel cake. Hello, Michael. Got some good news for you, sugar. Me too. Hello, Slukey my friend. You're no friend of mine. Go on, take the cigarettes. Why bother to shoot? What a beefer! I've only been coming here once every other day. That's twice too occasional. Load for me, sugar, and start with your news. You don't know it, but I'm in a big rush. What do you mean, rush? Our date's for the whole afternoon. It was. That's my good news. Vacation's over and I'm on a case. Don't you get it? I don't have to go back to Los Angeles yet. You're here. Well, it's perfect. Except for one thing. I'm going to Los Angeles. You missed! Oh, I lived to see the day! What for? A job. That was my good news. I thought we'd be down there together. How long you gonna be there? I'm not sure yet. I'm leaving tonight. Look, sugar, what does it take to get you to darn my socks, cook my corned beef and cabbage... and sort of confine your magic to one place and one customer? Oh, Michael, I would've died if you'd let me go away without saying something. I want my guy. I want a home, some kids. Honey, you've got your guy. But I understand kids take time. ...and the girl is expected at the store. Detective Crane, proceed immediately. Okay. Do some magic. Tell that horn to go away. Go away, horn. I didn't hear a thing. I'm sorry. I've gotta run, darling. How 'bout it? Say when. Two bucks and the justice of the peace, huh? Sunday? But my job! No, no, no, that's out now. I can't quit on them. Why not? Just give them a week's notice starting last week. Listen, darling, it isn't really the job. It's something else. I'll marry you the minute you get to Los Angeles, but it must be there. Why? I can't tell you why. Well, this is a fine start! Michael, listen! One of the hot bills was passed in a dress shop. We've got to get there quick. The guy's girl's coming up. I've gotta leave, darling. Come on. Michael, I'm leaving on the 7:00 Southern Pacific. Please come. If I can. He's acted funny ever since he came here. He don't talk to nobody, he don't look at nobody. Like he's got a secret. I haven't looked up his record yet, but I wouldn't doubt it. The girl ain't lyin'; His name is Raven. Is he in now? I think so, Officer. What do you know about him? I can tell you. He's no good. You took a present from him, didn't you? It wasn't a present. He tore my dress, that's why. Anyway, I was gonna sell it back and take the money. How'd he happen to tear your dress? All I did was chase his cat out of the room. And you know what? Just for that, he hits me right in the face. He treats everybody like that. What's his room number? Room 9. Here. Here's a key. Okay. And you, don't leave. When I can see him in handcuffs? Ha! Don't worry. I'm going up to his room. Wait here. Annie, my wife would never forgive me. She'd have triple fits if she missed this. I'll call home, and you try her at Sissie's. Okay. Don't put in that nickel. Lift the receiver. Dial. Pretend you're talkin' to the old lady. Say, " Hello, Mrs. Stewart. " Hello, Mrs. Stewart. Louder so the cop can hear ya. Tell her what's up. They're after Mr. Raven. Why? Because he passed a stolen bill in a dress shop. What do you mean, stolen? You oughta know. Talk into the phone. Yes, Mrs. Stewart. The dress shop had the number from the police department. Gates. Stolen from where? I don't know, Mrs. Stewart. You do know. I don't remember, Mrs. Stewart. You better remember! I gave you a dress, didn't I? Yeah. It could've landed me in jail. Shut up! He's not there. Phone headquarters, Charlie. Oh, that phone's busy. There's one in my office. Annie, did you get my wife? I'm tellin' her now it's no use to come over. That's right. Say, I know something that'll help you. His left wrist, it was badly broken. The bone is big. He never smiles, neither. I wouldn't keep him, only he pays. I'm respectable. Hmm. Well, don't touch his room. We want fingerprints. I'm going to put a man in the alley. If Raven comes in, go to the window and give it this with the shade. Huh? Raise it and lower it. Oh. Okay, sir. I'll cooperate. I'm respectable. I heard you the first time. Annie, what are you gabbin' about? And what's happened to that light in there? Get back! I oughta plug the both of ya. Stay in there and keep quiet. Hey, wait a minute. You're under arrest. What? You're under arrest! Southern Pacific. Stay with that cab. Yes, sir. Compartment C, car 189. Through to Los Angeles. Thank you. 'Board! 'Board. Michael! Hey, Michael! Oh, honey, I'm so glad you came. Please say it's all right for me to go. Gimme a kiss. Hey, where's your magic? Stop the train a minute. Say it's all right. Sure. I just got a little hot under the collar. You will hurry down, won't you? Soon as I finish this job. Why aren't you in a Pullman? Did they chisel you out of a berth? I took cash instead. Why? He has to go to college, doesn't he? Who does? Junior! Oh! Taken? Are you that broke? Come on. I know you're not asleep. You talkin' to me? What do you want? My five bucks. It was the only one I had, and one corner was torn off. Don't make me call the conductor. Hand it over and we'll forget it. I'm no pickpocket. Gotta find somebody in L.A. Short of cash, or I wouldn't have taken it. Wanna borrow a dollar? I'll get along. Well, I hope your friend owes you something. I owe him. I don't get it. If you're broke, how can you pay him? I can pay him. He's a fat man who likes peppermints. You're gonna pay a debt with peppermints? Yeah. First I find out who his boss is. Then I pay both of 'em, see? I don't see. That's all right. Well, I'm turning in. First call for breakfast! First call for breakfast! First call for breakfast! First call for breakfast! Morning. You're sure this wire will reach Los Angeles ahead of the train? Oh, yes, sir. Uh, keep it. Thank you very much. Next stop, Los Angeles. Let me see your left wrist. Okay, thank you. Wait a minute. Lookin' for me for a job I didn't do, and they're not gonna get me. You're gonna help. Can we see your left wrist? Can we see your left wrist? Let me see that wrist. Thank you. Can we see your left wrist? There won't be any shooting, will there? That's up to him. Can we see your left wrist? Why, it's only me, boss. Tommy, take these bags and don't let me out of your sight. Don't worry, boss. I'll be right here holding your hand. All right, get goin'. Can we see your left wrist? Can we see your left wrist? Let me see it. They got him! I tell ya I cut it. I'm a machinist. Yeah? No, no, no! You sure? Of course I'm sure. You've let him get away. Easy. He's still on that train. Dig him out! Well, you made it. Sorry I can't have breakfast with you, but I've got a dress rehearsal. You, uh, won't be needing the baby anymore, will you? Good luck. I got a job to do. Nobody knows you're here. Go ahead. Somebody does know. Keep walkin'. Look, I... In there. Turn around. Turn around! Hey, what are you doin' in here? Do you wanna get hurt? We're tearing this dump down! What's cookin' here? Everything is prepared for the gas mask rehearsal, sir. We're ready in the processing plant, sir. At 8:00 tomorrow morning, everyone will be wearing a gas mask. The same with packing and shipping, Mr. Brewster. And my department, sir. I didn't quite hear you, sir. That's excellent. Mr. Brewster says, "That's excellent. " For their own protection, see to it that all my employees take this rehearsal seriously. They're the only family I have. That's all. Mr. Brewster, I don't know how to quite tell you... You're a bungling idiot, Gates! I gave you a job to do involving millions and you botched it. I didn't botch it, sir. Here's Baker's letter and the formula. Raven got those, and then you let him slip through your fat fingers. Is that all? As a matter of fact, I don't know whether they're working together or not, but there was a girl on the train with Raven. You know anything about her? She's... a performer I just hired for my nightclub. Apparently you want to commit suicide. I didn't know that when I hired her, and now I'm afraid to turn her over to the police. They wouldn't believe anything Raven said, but they might believe her. You're a fool! Get down to that club of yours! Uh, take her out somewhere. F-Find out all about her. And get out of here! Yes, sir. When you get to L.A., you're to see Mr. Brewster, president of Nitro Chemical Corporation. Old King Chloride, huh? Headquarters said you're to go straight to the plant. Brewster is screaming because we didn't get Raven. I'll see him. So long, kid. Happy landings. Hey. Ellen! They told me you were coming down. How are you? I don't know yet. Where's the telephone? Come on, I'll show you. Pardon us. What's the matter? You look like you've been on a hayride with Dracula. You're not kidding. Long distance, please. Who are you calling? A cop. On long distance? My cop. He's in... San Francisco, please. Person-to-person call, Lieutenant Michael Crane, police headquarters. Say, what's this all about anyway? Five thousand bank notes. Places, girls! Places! Ruby, places! See you later, honey. Come on, girls. Hurry up, line up. Yes? He just left town. No, couldn't tell you. But... - Miss Graham, please! - Coming. I've got you right where I wanted you Dangling on my line I've got you and I'm enjoying it fine You had me right where you wanted me That's the way I learned You had me Ah, but the tables have turned I was one out of 50 in your address book Oh, what a spot you had me in But today you're the sucker for the shiny hook And you'll never wriggle off You can bet your bottom fin That I've got you right where I wanted you Dangling on my line I've got you and I'm enjoying it fine 'Cause I'm not yours anymore You're mine 'Cause I'm not yours You're mine Say, do you know anything about this Graham girl? What's the matter? Don't you like her act anymore? Charming! Break rehearsal for a few minutes. I want to talk to her alone. All right, girls. Ten minute break. How's Mr. Angel today? Fine. Fine. Is our date still on? I'll be with you the minute rehearsal is over. Suppose we have dinner at my house in Hollywood? I'll drive you back in time for the first show. Peppermint? Thanks. I'll pick you up. The Hotel Wilshire. Right. Oh, uh, I beg your pardon. Hey, Walt! That guy! It's him! Yes? Will Gates? He's in the shop. I'll get him. Yes? Are you Will Gates? What can I do for you? Not a thing. He's right in there. Get back. Yes? Hello, Mr. Gates. Did a man just come in here? He had the wrong address. I sent him around the corner. Thanks. Thanks, pal. Now, don't worry. We'll get him. I do worry, Lieutenant. Tell him, Mr. Collins. The man's a maniac. Why, he threatened to kill me if I gave the police his description. Look what he did to me. You see? One of my oldest employees. I want him protected. We'll put a man with him night and day. That's not enough. This man Raven is a professional killer. None of us is safe. - When'd you find that out? - This report came in 10 minutes ago. Take it. Read it. Check on it. My men are at your disposal. Hmm. Very interesting, Mr. Brewster. Thank you. Thank you, Lieutenant. I am sure we understand each other. And for the sake of my employees and your own men, this man Raven should be shot on sight. Good day, Lieutenant. Well, I... Good day, Lieutenant! This getup is giving me arthritis. Do you know where this is? Yes, indeed. That's Hollywood... way up in the hills. You can hitch a ride if you're broke. Thanks. You know, when I was a little boy and the rain came down like that, my mother used to say, "God is angry at someone. " He couldn't be angry at you, could he? Mmm, I don't remember bending any commandments. You know, you're a very intriguing girl. I want to know all about you. That's a big little word, "all. " Well... practically all. I looked for you on the train last night. I thought we might be in the same car. I tried the observation car, the diner, the Pullmans... - I was in the chair car. - Oh, really? Isn't that uncomfortable? Not for an old trooper. That is, of course, unless you're unlucky and your neighbor snores. Were you... unlucky? Oh, no! I sat with a very charming old lady. She told me about her farm in Iowa, how her grandmother came out in a covered wagon... What's the matter? So you do know him? What are you talking about? - You were with Raven on that train. I saw you! - What have you to do with him? He's after me and you're helping him. He'll use that gun, the gun he used on Baker! Why did you get mixed up in this? I'm a peaceful man. I hate violence. But don't think I won't protect myself. I don't understand it. That girl's so nuts about you, I'm sick of hearing about it. Now all of a sudden she rambles off with that fat wolf. Why? If I were you, lover, I'd scram right out there. That girl's wrestling by now, or I'm no judge of character. Yeah. Thanks. Never even scratched her. We're a cinch. In a couple of hours the bridge over the reservoir will be deserted. Look... Don't tell me! I don't want to know anything about it. This is a work of art. The ropes come off. I tie sash weights to her ankles with soft catgut. Please, that's a horrible word. Now get the angle on this. She disappears, two weeks, maybe three. Then up she pops. None of this stuff on her anymore. No marks. A suicide. Now, isn't that beautiful? That's loathsome! Be sure no one sees you. Don't worry. I'll take the other car. And when they find her... Don't tell me! Okay. Between me and the reservoir. I'll wait down at the Neptune 'til you come. You're all upset over nothing, boss. Eat a good dinner. It'll calm you down. Such a lovely body. It's revolting! That's a relief. Come to the club as soon as possible. Yeah, yeah. Uh, no, sir. Miss Graham's been gone about two hours. I thought she was having dinner here. Not that I know of. Mr. Gates go with her? No, sir. He just left a few minutes ago. I'd like to use your phone. Certainly, sir. Excuse me. It's right over there. Thanks. Here you are, sir. This is Police Lieutenant Crane. Give me the Hotel Wilshire right away, please. Miss Ellen Graham. Oh, she did? What's the forwarding address? Huh. Thank you. Do you know where Mr. Gates went? No, sir. But he generally has dinner at the Neptune Club. Miss Graham is not in any trouble, is she? Personal matter. I see. Good night, sir. Good night. All right, get 'em up. In the back way. Say, what is this? Against that wall. Now, where is she? Oh, the girl? Oh, she-she left. Why'd you dump this, then? Well, she was here, see, but... Take it easy. What's Gates got against you? He saw us on the train. He thinks I'm your girl. How'd he catch up with you? I work in his nightclub. You got one of those dressing rooms, haven't you? Mm-hmm. Come on. What for? He's eating there tonight and I want to talk to him alone. Look, I'm not gonna hurt you. You treated me okay. But you do what I tell you. Come on. All right, but you'll have to help me. So you're a copper's girl. Who told you that? He was here lookin' for you, and he better stay away from me. Have you tried her hotel? They said she checked out. Then I'm afraid I can't help you. For you, sir. Oh. Thank you. Hello? No. Yes! He's got your car. The girl's with him. Get out of there fast, boss. Watch that cop. He's her boyfriend. Uh, right. Excuse me, uh... that was business. I've got to leave. I'll walk along with you. We've got some more talking to do. Good evening, sir. Go straight to your dressing room. Michael! Ellen, where have you been? Watch it, copper. It's Raven. Do what he says. You stay where you are. There's a dragnet out for you, Raven. It won't do you any good to hurt her, so use your head. You better stay put. Stop Gates! Tell him to stay in town. Where'd that couple go? What couple? I didn't see anyone, sir. Come here! Get on that radio and tell them to round up every police car they can spare. Cover this whole district. Hey, Mike, I told Gates what you said, but... Wait a minute. Hey! These are Ellen's! She's blazing a trail for us. Tell them to look for cards with these initials on 'em. Right. I've got to rest a minute. It's the gas works. We'll hide out inside until morning. You stay up on top until I get there. And don't try to run. Who do you think I am? Whirlaway? Hey! Here's one. Meet us at the other end of this alley. Hey, look at this. If we go after him in the dark, somebody's gonna get hurt. Ellen maybe. But if we keep him cooped up until morning, then we can spot him easy. Let's flood these walls with searchlights. Yes, sir. Steve, you and I will go after him alone. Maybe I can talk him into the open. Not him! I said "maybe. " Give us a boost over. Come on, boys, let's go. I've been thinking about what you said. We both took a beating from the same guy, didn't we? Yeah. I think I know where he'll be in the morning. Where? You've got to tell me something first. I want to know what you've got against him. I did a job for him. He paid me off in hot money so he could put me where I couldn't talk. What was the job? Your turn now. You haven't told me. Your turn now. He's at Nitro Chemical. Thanks. Get up on the catwalk. Be careful of Ellen, but if he starts to blast, let him have it. Raven! I want to talk to you. You're bottled up. You can't get out. We're moving in when it's daylight. We don't want to shoot unless you make us, so come on out and talk it over. Raven! Do you hear me, Raven? That cop of yours. We've got to move again. Hey, have you seen anything? I've looked everywhere and I haven't seen a thing, sir. Wait. Get in there. You're sure there's no place he can get out? That must come out someplace. Go on. Where's this go? To the railroad yards over there. You stay here. I'm gonna beat him to it! Go ahead. When you get on the new bridge, turn your searchlights into the yards. When we spot that drainpipe, we've got him. All right, step on it. There's some sort of light ahead. Keep goin'. What's down there? Looks like a railroad yards. Look out. Get on those searchlights. Over to the right. Turn the other one. Right away, sir. All right, turn around and drop down. Some fun! Keep every foot of the yard covered. Yes, sir. Swing the beam to the left. Lower. Yes, sir. Okay, we'll keep 'em here 'til morning. Still bottled up. Why don't you hop a rattler and get out of this? I've got that job to do. Come on, we'll find an empty. Take it easy. I've got a twisted ankle. Hogan, take 15 men and stop every train going in or out. You certainly pack an arsenal. Something I took from Gates' chauffeur. What happened? Drain pipe wire. You'll get dirt in it. Have you got a handkerchief? Forget it, will ya? That's it, boys. Cover the whole yard. That's enough. You're a funny guy. You like my doing that, but you won't admit it. That's sucker talk. You killed Baker. Gates told me. Who's the man behind him? That's what I'm trying to find out. Maybe I can help. You must have some idea who it is. Baker was blackmailing the guy behind Gates. He was going to send a letter about him to Washington. I gave it to sweet-tooth. What was in it? Piece of paper with some kind of arithmetic on it. A prescription he called it. Like a chemical formula? How do I know? Was the letter going to Senator Burnett? Huh? Yeah, that was his name. Hey, this is good luck. Cats bring you luck. And it's hungry. Ain't got nothin' for you, Tuffy. You like cats, don't you? Yeah. They're on their own. They don't need anybody. Well, this one could do with a friend. So could you. You're tryin' to make me go soft. Well, you can save your oil. I don't go soft for anybody. I could put somebody else in charge. I'd appreciate it if you didn't. What about your girl? That's just the point. This guy's a killer, all right. I've checked Brewster's information. That's why I want to wait 'til morning and gas him out. They'll move in in the morning. Every flatfoot in town. You know, I've been figuring something. That chemical formula. Yeah? I bet I know what it is. What? Gas. Poison gas. They're selling it to our enemy. So? So tomorrow they'll ship it back in bombs. Japanese breakfast food for America. Did you hear what I said? It's important. This war is everybody's business. Yours too. Mr. Gates is still eating his peppermints. That's my business. Why don't you stop thinking about yourself for a minute? Who else is gonna? Hey, look out for that clothesline! Some doings tonight. A cop wherever you spit. Yeah. How'd you like to be worth 5,000 smackers dead or alive? Wouldn't care for it dead. Did you hear that? That meowing? Come on. They don't pay off on cats. Let it up. They've gone. Let it up. It's dead. I killed it. I killed my luck. You got the break, Tuffy. I'd like to crawl down there with you and sleep. Why don't you sleep for a while? It's no good. I'd only dream. Every night I dream. I read somewhere about a kind of doctor, a psycho-something. If you tell your dream, you don't have to dream it anymore. That's right. You... You wouldn't laugh if I told ya, would ya? It's a woman. I dream about a woman. She used to beat me. To whip the bad blood out of me, she said. My old man was hanged. My mother died right after that, and I went to live with that woman... my aunt. She beat me from the time I was three 'til I was 14. One day she... caught me reaching for a piece of chocolate. She was saving it for a cake. A crummy piece of chocolate. She hit me... with a red-hot flatiron. Smashed my wrist with it. I grabbed a knife. I let her have it... in the throat! They stuck a label on me... killer. They shoved me in a reform school, and they beat me there too! But I'm glad I killed her. What's the use? There's nothing I can do. There is something you can do. Don't kill anymore. You're just killing her all over again. That's all you're doing. You don't really want to get Gates. What do you want me to do, send him some candy? I want you to make him spill the whole works. Who's behind him, names, everything. I want a signed confession. That's more important than killing him. It's important to your country. Come on, take your hands off of me. Button up, will ya? I'll take care of Gates my way. No, please! Get away from me. Go on, get away. Gonna wait for it to lift? We'll have to. It's thicker than gravy down there. No chance for a getaway. An eel couldn't get through. We've got every foot covered. They're waitin' for my whistle the minute it clears. No soap, huh? Too many of' em. But I got a proposition for ya. You still want that stuff from Gates? Of course I do. Help me outta here and I'll get it for you. Or was that hot air last night, that flag-waving? Come on, make up your mind. Okay, I'll shoot it out with 'em. I hope your copper gets the first slug. No, wait a minute! Promise me you won't use that anymore. All right. It's a deal. You go first, across the yard. Don't run or they'll know it's a woman. Here, take this. Wait 'til they spot you, then get under something. Stall as long as you can, then come out with your hands up. Now? Let them go first. Wait for the whistle. We'll give it another minute. You're gonna marry that copper? Right guy for ya? Mm-hmm. Okay. All right, go ahead. Look! Spread out, but watch me. Send Glennon up the embankment. Right away, sir. He's underneath there. All right, boys, let's use the gas on him. Chuck. So old man Brewster was right. She is Raven's girl, huh? All right, Crane, I'll take over. Drop it! The other one. You boys stick here. Come on! Hey, get outta there! Ellen, you've got to tell me. Where'd he go? Mike? He got Glennon. Yeah? Dead? Yeah. He promised me he wouldn't. Where'd he go? Now use your head! That guy's a killer! How did you meet him? What were you doing with him? I can't tell you. This isn't a cop asking. It's me. He saved my life. Where? At Gates' house? What was he doing there? So that's who he's after. He's headed for Nitro! Well, so are we. What's the matter? Did I scare ya? This is no time to be funny! I'm sorry, boss. Take it easy. Did you see the rehearsal? It's started. Yes, it gives me the shivers. Any news from the police? Yes. They're waiting for the fog to lift. What's the matter with them? It's lifted! Then everything's okay. I hope so. But you stay out there in front of my door. No visitors. Leave it to me. Will ya take it easy? You only got one life. Ladies and gentlemen, we will first visit the processing plant. This way, please. What? When? Raven's escaped! He's coming here! Phone the company police, and tell Tommy not to budge from that door. Tommy? Tommy! Mr. Gates, Tommy isn't there. Isn't there? Well, f-find him! Tommy, where have you been? Mr. Gates wants you in his office. Hurry! Tommy, you're getting very lax. Don't you realize that maniac could've walked right in here? The old man wants to see me. While I'm up there, get me a bottle of Scotch. I need it. This hot money too? What? Miss... No, you don't. I'm not to blame. You wouldn't... kill an innocent man, would you? It's all his fault. I was acting as his agent. Quiet. We'll both see the old man. Get up. Come on. Yes. Yes. Tell Mr. Brewster he'll be right up. Mr. Gates. Hello, Tommy. Have you heard about Raven? He escaped from the railroad yards. And Mr. Brewster is having a fit about it! Well... what delayed ya? What's the matter with ya? Put that thing away. That's him, huh? What do you want? My name's Raven. Don't answer it. What is that? This button, it rings the alarm and opens the doors. For 15 years! Dressing you, nursing you, cleaning you, listening to your dirty deals. Go ahead, wipe him out! We got business to do. Come on, give him that pad. Can you get to that office from the roof? No, sir. Wait a minute. There's a painter's scaffold up there. - Come on! - Who are you selling that gas to? You look like a young man who knows a good thing. Why don't you... - Do what he says! He'll kill you! - Stop whining! I'll tell you. That new gas formula, he sold it to the highest bidder. You've just committed suicide, Gates. To the Japanese! You know this stuff. You write it, and he'll sign. I will not sign it! And don't you think I will, young man! You'll sign. Let her go. There. If you want any more, there's the medal for services rendered... from his boyfriends abroad! H-How much do you want, Raven? I'm a rich man. Take that pen while you still got a chance. Oh, h-h-how foolish young men are. All right, you're next. Oh, yes, yes, I'll sign. Look out! Dead. His heart. One final double-cross. Believe me, it was Brewster! There's something else. You tried to kill that girl. No. No! That girl's my friend. She's not your friend. She told the police. - Shut up! - They called me up! - You're lying! Why are they here? She told them! She... So this was it. You didn't tell the cops, did ya? Did I do all right for you? Oh, Michael, my darling, hold me.
