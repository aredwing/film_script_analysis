YOU TOOK YOUR PLACE. - TOO FUCKIN' RIGHT, I DID. CHUCK, A POWER MAN. BRASH. OOGIE, I COULD TASTE YOU. ARIEL, YOU HAD WINGS ON YOUR BACK. I COULD SEE YOUR WINGS. AND YOU... YOU SEXY MOTHERFUCKER. THAT IS RIGHT. I CALLED HIM FORTH. I PLUCKED HIM HENCE. STAIN, MY LOVE, YOU HAVE TO WRITE A SONG. A SONG THAT WILL SUPPORT OUR D AS HE ROLLS DOWNSTAGE. BECAUSE WHEN WE TOUR, WHICH WE WILL, OUR BABY'S GONNA BE NAMED... "HEALAPALOOZA." HEALAPALOOZA, EH? HEALA-FUCKIN'. OUR BABY. OUR FUCKIN' BABY. I AM BRINGING ABOU THE DIPHTHONGS EXPERIENCE TO THE PEOPLE. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT, NINA, LOVE, ALL RIGHT? I WANTED DEAN IN THE BAND FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE OF HIS SCRATCHING. THIS MAN IS AN ARTIST. NOT SOME SIDESHOW FREAK. HE'S NOT GONNA SELL HIMSELF OU TO A LITTLE MAGIC HANDS TRICK. THE BAND IS THE MUSIC. WE WILL OVERRIDE THE SHOW INTO SOME DISPLAY AND BE RESPECTED. BUT, D, DUDE, YOU MAY END UP A PATHETIC JOKE. ARE YOU COOL WITH THAT, MAN? FUCK IT. LONG AS I'M GETTING PAID. DO Y'ALL HEAR THAT? ARE WE CLEAR, NINA? - YEAH. - GOOD. I'VE GOT PHONE CALLS TO MAKE.

THAT'S GOOD. YOU'RE OWED. YOU'RE OWED. YOU'RE OWED, RIGHT? YEAH, EVERYBODY OWES YOU. - YOU'RE SO FULL OF SHIT! I'M ABOUT TO PU YOUR CRAP ASS BAND ON THE FUCKING MAP! I'M GONNA GIVE EVERYTHING YOU WANTED! WHAT'S ALL THIS PURITY COMING FROM YOU? YEAH, MYBAND! MYBAND! MY FUCKIN' BAND, YOU MOTHERFUCKER! YOU FUCKIN' PIECE OF SHIT! YOU HAVE GOD'S GIFT! YOU HAVE GOD'S GIFT! DO YOU EVEN CARE ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE, DEAN? DO YOU EVEN CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM? WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? I KNOW MY PLACE IN THE WORLD. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU? PIECE OF SHIT. - I'M SO GLAD YOU DECIDED TO LEGALLY JOIN THE FOLD. I CAN NEVER FIRE YOU EVER. DEAN, LOOK, THERE WERE 17 SICK OR INFIRM PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE THE OTHER NIGHT. TWELVE OF THEM SAID THEY WERE HEALED. NOW IF THAT'S AN INDICATOR, THEN YOU'RE MISSING 28% OF THE TIME, WHICH IS A MARKETING NIGHTMARE. AND THAT MEANS THAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT, WHICH YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT. BUT I'M THE ONE WHO'S TAKING THE RISK. I NEED SECURITY. YOU'LL SEE. IT'S A PRETTY STANDARD CONTRACT. SEVEN-YEAR NEGOTIATION CLAUSE ON MY END, PLUS A FEW EXTRAAMENITIES, BECAUSE I'M SO HANDS-ON. AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT SWEETENING YOUR END. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT A SIGNING BONUS, HMM? GOOD. YOU READY? IT'S CALLED "HEALAPALOOZA." DOWNTOWN, THERE'S A BUZZ GOING ON. A NEW BAND CLAIMS TO HEAL PEOPLE DURING THEIR SHOW, ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY HEAL THEM. FANS ARE SWEARING UP AND DOWN THEY'VE RECEIVED HEALINGS FROM THE TOUCH OF THE BAND'S DJ, DELICIOUS DEAN. THE CONTROVERSIAL HEALAPALOOZA TOUR IS GAINING MOMENTUM OF TRUE BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS. ARTY PUNK-ROCK BAND, BURNT THE DIPHTHONGS, DENIED ACCUSATIONS THAT THEIR ONSTAGE MIRACLES ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A PUBLICITY STUNT. IN FACT, THEY CLAIMED THE SHOW IS REALLY ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC. HE TOUCHED ME IN DIFFERENT PLACES, BUT THEN HE FOCUSED HIS ENERGY WHERE I TOLD HIM I HAD MY TUMOR. I WOULDN'T SLEEP WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME. THE BIZARRE SCRATCH ROCK HEALING PUNK SHOW HAS SPARKED A RIO AND EVEN A RELIGIOUS PROTEST. BUT IT'S ALSO BEING CALLED "NEW CHURCH" BY ITS SURPRISINGLY DIVERSE FANS. DELICIOUS DEAN IS GOD. DESPITE THE GROWING NUMBER OF ATTACKS FROM DOCTORS AND THE AMA DENOUNCING THE SHOW AS A HOAX AND PROJECTED TICKET SALES REACHING INTO THE MILLIONS, IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE WHAT FANS ARE LOOKING FOR. A NEED TO BELIEVE. A NEED FOR SOMETHING MORE FROM THEIR MUSIC. SOMETHING IN THE FORM OF A TOUCH FROM THE BAND'S MESSIANIC SUPERSTAR. - SHE JUST PULLED ME RIGHT OUT OF THE CROWD, SAID "JUST PU THE NECK BRACE ON." UGH. SHIT. EASIEST $100 I'VE EVER MADE. SHE MADE YOU SAY SOMETHING TOO? MM-HMM. - WHAT'S UP? - NOTHING. - WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN? AND WHERE THE FUCK IS ARIEL? WE FUCKING REHEARSED THIS. YOU ENTER BEFORE ME. LISTEN TO ME, FUCK HEAD. I MADE YOU, YOU CUNT. I PUT ON THAT FUCKING STAGE. YOU JUST GET OUT THERE AND TURN YOUR FUCKING TRICKS. COME ON, YEAH! LET'S FUCKIN' HAVE IT. THEY SAID I WAS TORN  WHERE THE WATER HAD STOPPED  IN THE CRADLE OF FUSES WAITING FOR A FINAL SOLUTION  ELIMINATE THE ACCENT  DO I DIMINISH THE THREAT?  SOMETIMES I NEED YOU  JUST TO STAY A LITTLE UPSET  DO YOU OR DON'T YOU  WANT TO BELIEVE?  IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT  IT'S WHAT YOU NEED   WE'VE GOT A LITTLE MAGIC TRICK FOR YOU TONIGHT. A LITTLE CRACKER JACK ACTION AND SIDESHOW ACTION. THAT'S RIGHT, DEAN. THEY'RE CALLING FOR YOU, MAN. GIVE US A LITTLE BI OF YOUR FUCKING MAGIC HANDS TRICK. THAT'S RIGHT. FUCKING HEALING. - SHUT THE FUCK UP. COME ON. HA HA HA. THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE HEALING. COME ON THERE, MAN. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? GIVE THEM A HEALING, DEAN. - SHUT THE FUCK UP. HEAL THEM. HEAL THEM, DEAN. - FUCK YOU, THE STAIN! - USE YOUR MAGIC HANDS. FUCK YOU. GIVE THEM YOUR MAGIC HANDS, MAN. - COME HERE! RIGHT HERE! - GIVE THEM YOUR MAGIC HANDS. - LET HIM GO. COME ON. - COME ON. - LET HIM GO. - COME ON. WHERE IS IT? - COME ON. COME ON. HEY, ARIEL. ARIEL. DUDE, STOP. STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP. DUDE, STAIN. DUDE, DUDE, DUDE, GET THE FUCKING PARAMEDICS. SHE'S OD'ING. SHE'S FUCKING OD'ING MAN. FUCK. DUDE. ARIEL. FUCK, MAN. HERE. RIGHT HERE IS WHERE HOMICIDE BEGINS. IN THESE PRECIOUS MOMENTS, WHEN LIFE-SAVING DECISIONS COULD HAVE BEEN MADE, WHAT WAS ON THE MIND OF THE ROCK STAR, DEAN O'DWYER? WHAT WAS HE THINKING AS ARIEL LEE LAY AT HIS FEET, TAKING HER LAST BREATH? WAS HE THINKING, "WOW, WHAT A SHOW. HOW ARE WE GOING TO RECREATE THIS?" BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THIS, HE WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT ARIEL LEE BECAUSE IF HE WAS, HELP WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO ARIEL LEE AND SHE MIGHT BE HERE TODAY. AND THAT, BY DEFINITION, IS MANSLAUGHTER. - THIS IS A TRAGEDY TO SAY THE LEAST. WE ARE ALL ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED. DELICIOUS D'S ACTIONS WERE SELFLESS AND HEROIC AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SENSITIVITY AT THIS TIME. ARIEL LEE DID NOT DIE BECAUSE OF NEGLECT. ARIEL LEE DIED BECAUSE SHE OD'D. THEY WERE... PEOPLE SAID THEY WERE HEALED. DEAN, MAN, YOU SHOULD HAVE LE THE PARAMEDICS AT HER BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T HEAL HER OR WHATEVER HAPPENED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. MAYBE YOU DID TOO MUCH. JUST REMEMBER, YOU ARE UNDER OATH, SO JUST... JUST TELL US THE TRUTH. I SAY HE IS THE LIVING EMBODIMEN OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN HUMANKIND. WE ALL WANT TO KNOW THERE'S GOOD IN PEOPLE. AND I'M NO EXCEPTION TO THAT. THE CROWD WAS CHANTING FOR HER TO BE HEALED. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS ALL PAR OF THE SHOW. I GRABBED THE MIKE TO CALL FOR HELP, BUT POWER HAD BEEN CU TO THE STAGE AND THE PARAMEDICS HAD BEEN BLOCKED. I DIDN'T GET TO SAY WHAT NEEDED TO BE SAID THAT NIGHT. SO I'M GOING TO SAY WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID NOW. AND IT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN ASKED NOT TO SAY BY DEAN O'DWYER AND NINA HOGUE. OBJECTION. - YOUR HONOR, SIDEBAR PLEASE. - AND THAT IS THAT HE'S A FAKE. - SIDEBAR. - HE'S A PHONY. - OBJECTION! - HE'S A FRAUD. - ORDER! - THIS CHARLATAN SON OF A BITCH! - BAILIFF, REMOVE HIM. HE CAN'T HEAL SHIT! IT WAS ALL A FUCKING ACT! YOU WERE ALL DUPED! - ORDER! HE NEVER COULD HEAL! YOU BOUGHT A FUCKING LIE! WELL, WELCOME TO THE FUCKING SHOW! AS THE RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY FIGURE WHO FIRST ENCOURAGED THIS GIFT, YOU CAN TESTIFY TO DEAN'S HEALING TECHNIQUE AND HIS INTENSE CONCENTRATION, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED BY THE PARAMEDICS. IN THAT REGARD, THAT MAKES YOU OUR EXPERT WITNESS. AND CHARACTER WITNESS DESCRIBING DEAN'S EARLY HEALINGS ON SKID ROW. HOW SELFLESS HE WAS. HOW PURE HIS MOTIVES WERE. MR. O'DWYER HAS GRACIOUSLY AGREED FREE OF CHARGE AND FOR A DESIGNATED PERIOD OF TIME TO COME DOWN TO SKID ROW AND LAY HANDS ON WHOMEVER YOU WISH. IN EXCHANGE FOR MY TESTIMONY? - YES. - NO. NO. CAN I SPEAK TO DEAN ALONE FOR A MOMENT PLEASE? YOU DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT, FATHER. BY THE WAY, JUST SO YOU KNOW, I'M A MARYMOUNT GIRL AND I-I HAD THE CALLING TO BE A NUN, BUT I LOST MY WAY. MAYBE SOMETIME WE'D GET TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT THAT. CERTAINLY. - THANK YOU, FATHER. - THANK YOU, FATHER. SOMETHING ELSE, HUH? I, UM, I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING. SHOW YOU SOME OF THE GOOD WORK YOU DID. THAT MEXICAN WOMAN WHOSE HANDKERCHIEF YOU TOUCHED, YOU HEALED HER HUSBAND, DEAN. YOU HEALED HIM. THE CLOTH, IT CARRIED THE POWER. I SHOULD HAVE TOUCHED HEALAPALOOZA HANKIES, HUH? SOLD THEM AT THE T-SHIRT BOOTHS. THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY THAT I KILLED SOMEBODY. THAT'S BULLSHIT. THEY'RE JUST COMING AFTER ME BECAUSE OF WHO I AM. ARIEL WAS A JUNKIE. SHE TOOK A BUNCH OF PILLS. AND I DID EVERYTHING I COULD. I THOUGHT IT WAS WORKING. - IT'S HARD TO KNOW, ISN'T IT? - OKAY. ALL RIGHT. LET'S MAKE IT RIGHT. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOUR SHELTER? HOW ABOUT THIS? THE LORD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS. THINK OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HELP. I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY, DEAN. I MISUSED YOU. - IT'S OKAY. I FORGIVE YOU. YOU WANT TO HELP ME? DO THIS. DO THIS FOR ME. I'LL TESTIFY FOR YOU. I'LL TESTIFY TO THE HEALINGS THAT I SAW, BUT THAT'S IT. I WON'T BE YOUR CHARACTER WITNESS BECAUSE I-I WON'T GE ON THAT STAND AND SAY THAT... THAT YOUR MOTIVES WERE PURE. - WHAT WERE MY MOTIVES? - I DON'T KNOW, DEAN. ALL I KNOW IS THAT YOU ABANDONED THOSE PEOPLE WHEN THEY NEEDED YOU. YOU ABANDONED THEM TO BECOME A ROCK STAR. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY? - I'M NOT GONNA LIE. - OH! NO! NO, YOU CAN'T LIE. YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR THAT. YOU CAN'T CON PEOPLE. YOU DON'T USE PEOPLE FOR YOUR OWN GLORY. YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WHAT IF ON CROSS-EXAMINATION, MY LAWYER ASKS WHAT WERE YOUR MOTIVES? TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GRAND. THAT HAS NO BEARING ON ANY OF THIS, DEAN. - OH, YES, IT DOES. - NO, IT DOESN'T. - OH, YES IT DOES. - NO. YOU ARE THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS WHOLE THING. PAYING FOR MIRACLES. WHERE DID I GET THAT FROM? SO LET'S JUST SAY, FATHER, THAT YOU'RE GONNA GE ON THE STAND AND YOU'RE GONNA TELL THE FUCKING TRUTH. THE TRUTH IS IS THAT YOU PROSTITUTED YOUR GIFT. NO, THE TRUTH IS YOU PROSTITUTED ME. - THAT IS NOT TRUE. - PROVE IT ISN'T. CAN YOU PUT YOUR HAND ON YOUR BIBLE AND SAY YOU DIDN'T DO THAT? DEAN, I HAVE ADMITTED MY WRONGS, ALL RIGHT? BUT I AM NOT GONNA REPEAT THEM. THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S REALLY FUCKING HOLY OF YOU, FATHER. I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL. FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU, DEAN O'DWYER. YOU THINK, WHAT... YOU THINK... YOU THINK... YOU THINK THIS MEANS ANYTHING TO ME? YOU THINK YOU CAN BUY ME? YOU THINK I'M FOR SALE? I'M NOT LIKE YOU. YOU'RE NOT GONNA RUIN MY LIFE TWICE. YOU SOLD ME OUT! FOR YOUR OWN FUCKING SAINTHOOD! I TRIED... AND YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN RIGHT NOW! I TRIED TO SAVE YOU. I TRIED TO GIVE THAT GIF TO THE PEOPLE... YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME! WHO IT BELONGS TO. YOUR GOD-GIVEN GIFT, MY FRIEND. YOU'RE A BULLSHIT PRIEST! YOU ARE A FUCKING FRAUD! HOW DARE YOU. YOU ARE THE MOST SELFISH... I AM OUT THERE EVERY NIGH FOR THE MASSES! YOU'VE GOT A GOD-GIVEN GIFT. AND WHAT DID YOU DO? YOU USED IT FOR YOURSELF! - IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? FORGIVE ME. EXCUSE ME. AND THAT IS WHY YOU ARE HERE TODAY, FATHER. NOW, FATHER, I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT YOU ARE IN YOUR CIVILIAN CLOTHES TODAY. - YES. - MM-HMM. NOW, IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON FOR THAT? - I'M ON A LEAVE OF ABSENCE. - OKAY. BUT YOU ARE AN ORDAINED CATHOLIC PRIES THESE PAST 16 YEARS. - THAT'S CORRECT. - OKAY. NOW, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BELIEVES IN HANDS-ON HEALING. IT IS DESCRIBED AS A GENUINE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. SO NOW, FATHER ROSSELLI, CAN YOU, AS A MODERN PRIEST, COME BEFORE US TODAY AND SAY THAT HE HAS THE POWER TO HEAL? BECAUSE IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS: IF DEAN O'DWYER CANNOT HEAL, THEN THIS WAS A SHOW AND A TALENTED YOUNG WOMAN IS DEAD BECAUSE OF IT. SO, FATHER, IN YOUR EXPERT OPINION, DOES DEAN O'DWYER HAVE THE ABILITY TO HEAL? GOD. GOD IS THE ONLY HEALER. OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR. SPECULATION. HOW CAN THAT BE SPECULATION WHEN I'VE ASKED YOUR OWN WITNESS TO... WE ARE NOT SPEAKING OF A METAPHORICAL HEALING HERE, YOUR HONOR. ORDER. ORDER! HE IS MAKING A MOCKERY OF THIS COURT. I'LL HAVE ORDER IN MY COURT, COUNSEL. PERMISSION TO REDIREC THE HONOR... - COUNSEL! - THE WITNESS. YOUR HONOR, PLEASE. WHAT'S UP? HOW ARE YOU? I WANNA HELP YOU GET OUT OF HERE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. PROGRAMS FOR DISABLED PRISONERS ARE LIMITED OBVIOUSLY, BUT THERE ARE SOME, AND I THINK YOU SHOULD GET INVOLVED. I GOT NOTHING BUT TIME IN HERE. AND I WANTED TO BE SO PISSED AT YOU. BUT ALL I CAN THINK IS HOW BAD I FUCKED EVERYTHING UP. NAH, JUST TAKE YOUR TIME, DEAN. KEEP YOUR NOSE CLEAN. WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING? YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS I DOING? WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO LET THE PARAMEDICS COME UP AND DO THEIR JOB. THERE'S... THERE'S ONE PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR THAT I... THAT I THINK YOU'D BE GOOD FOR. IT'S A... IT'S A WORK DETAIL. YOU GET TO LEAVE PRISON GROUNDS TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE. YOU KNOW IF I GOT OUT OF HERE, I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'D START. I GOT NOTHING. I CAN'T HELP MYSELF. I CAN'T... I NEED HELP. I NEED... SORRY, DEAN. I TRIED TO CONTROL YOUR GIFT. I WANTED TO BE MORE THAN WHAT I WAS AND I WANTED YOU TO BE SOMEONE YOU WEREN'T. I'M NOT A PRIEST ANYMORE, DEAN. LOOK... I KNOW YOU THOUGH YOU WERE HELPING ME, BUT NOTHING HELPS. MAYBE YOU CAN'T HELP EVERYBODY. - NO, NO. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HELPED ME? WHEN YOU FED ME. YOU FED ME. YOU FED PEOPLE. A CRIPPLED WORK PROGRAM? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? HANG ON A SECOND. - GET BACK OVER HERE! - LET'S GO, GENTLEMEN! LET'S MOVE IT! MOVE IT! COME ON! - THAT'S REALLY NICE. - HUH? THE SHIRTS.
