( heart beating ) Here on the remote island of Kuttyhunk globally famed as a hotbed for scientific research... Proverbial gold has been found in a new breed of pearl, genetically engineered by the innovative scientific community that lives and runs this tiny island. Scientists from around the world moved here after World War ll as a meeting ground for inventive minds. Mason, famous for controlling his image, refused to comment on this groundbreaking achievement. Man:...Ieaving this reporter wondering, if they can produce this, what else are they capable of? ( heart monitor beeping ) Today is day one of the Human Growth Project. We believe that through continued development of parasitic research we can provide humanity with a tool that will remove the limitations placed on us by our DNA. Some people thought this to be impossible until now. This is important. This is monumental. And we have distribution in six out of the eight major territories-- quite an achievement. We need to think even bigger. We need to think global. We need to think evolution. Look at where we started and look how far we have come. I should acknowledge my niece Amanda Lane, without whom this would not have been possible. Behind this curtain-- ( crash ) ( screaming ) Run! Run! We've managed to control the outbreak. There have been fewer than two dozen deaths. - ( screaming ) - In the pan is a layer of ocean water. And since the island is surrounded by salt water, I think the mainland will remain safe for quite some time. But we are so close. Amanda has the antidote. We can reverse-engineer-- I can make this work. This is sadly part of the process. Man: Oh my God! Oh my God! Get out of here! Let me in! Let me in! Oh, Jesus. ( screaming ) - Sarah, hey. - Hey. - It's nice to put a face with the name. - Yeah, nice to meet you. Hi. How's everything at the camp? Fine, I guess. - It's not that bad. - What's not? He's landsick. Things are still moving. Yeah, I don't feel too well either. It is a little choppy out there. You don't have to make excuses for me. - I wasn't. - Yeah, you were. ( quiet rock music playing ) Weird being back, huh? A little. I told you I'd take care of it. No, it's good to get closure. I'm glad you called. The compound's kind of fallen apart over the years. That's why I brought my cleaning crew. - Oh my God. - How do you guys know each other? Boyfriend, stepbrother, friend. - Best friend. - Best friend. Should we show them how we make out sometimes? What? Like you guys don't want to see us making out. And you're Mason's niece? He was my great uncle, yeah. He and your mom are pretty famous here on the island. Jamie: Actually, my mom died here when I was a kid. But Marco got a call that Mason had passed away and left his property. So we're just here to clean it and sell it. - Is it worth a lot? - It's worth $2 million, actually. - No way. - But the weirdest part is that last month I was paying their rent and this month they're millionaires. - You're gonna let that go? - I'm not saying you have to pay me-- - It's my fault. - Justin. No. I got sick and they paid for me again. He has low immunity. I should be paying you back. Don't worry about it, bro. It'll work out. And we're gonna pay back your trust fund with interest. Awesome. ( child whispering ) Do you hear that? She's fine, baby. Go to sleep. Don't worry, Mom. I'm fine. I'm not worried, sweetie. Come here. ( giggling ) They're awake. Robert. Honey, get up. Robert: What? Emily. Emily, it's gonna be okay, baby. We're gonna get you some help. We're fine, Dad. ( screaming ) Daddy. This place is worth $2 million? Okay, well, I stayed up all night making the CD so that when we clean we could-- Wait, you said tonight was chill time. But it's French '80s disco. French '80s disco? Jamie, I'm gonna go to my room take off my shoes, tickle my accordion and go to bed. - And tomorrow we can do-- - Kristin. Tomorrow we can do it, Jamie. Am I right? - No. - I deem this weekend you shall be with a mustache. - No. - It's a mustache weekend, Justin. - Kristin. - And it looks so perfect. You look like a man. Oh, do you think you could grab my accordion? It's too heavy for me. Thank you. But be careful with it. It means a lot. Why did you even invite her? Because that chick would body-block a bus for me, and she hates public transportation. Come on, baby, this is me. I just-- I want to sell this place, you know, and have it be done. You are in luck, 'cause I am here-- the fixer of all things. Yeah, after you break them. Yeah, but I fix them though. Did you hear anything? No, sorry, babe. - Slimy Toads. - Huh? Slimy Toads-- it's the name of our bunk. So why don't you make your call and then meet me there... naked? I like Slimy Toads. ( applause ) - Mommy. - Jamie. I'm so proud of you. I like it. How is this any different from the last room? Well, you're here, for one. So? So I'm scared to be alone, Justin. I don't want to get hurt again. I don't know. I get scared. - ( screams ) - What? I totally got you. Bottom or top? I like it on top. Good. It's all yours. No, Justin, I said that I like it on top-- Justin: Could you not--? I came here to get some quiet, not to be told what to do by some bossy boss lady. You know, some people think I'm fun. Good. Fuck. ( car engine starts ) Hey, excuse me. How are you? Do you happen to know where a local pay phone is? What the hell? ( Marco snoring ) Moron. On the TV I saw a man selling second chance I thought, "What kind of sucker needs to buy self-confidence?" I sit alone on a Friday night in boxer briefs Saying I realize-- ( group singing ) Oh, this is incredible. Gina. No, I mean you told me about them but-- We've got to figure out how this is happening again so we can stop it. Listen. Infection, cellular lymphomatosis fusion, reproduction. Gina, these things infect. They ingest. They multiply and destroy. There's no middle ground here. Maybe it's some kind of mutation gestating in a plant or a bug. I mean, parasites live just about anywhere. A fish maybe? No, probably not a fish, at least not saltwater anyway. Watch. Watch what happens. Here. Salt kills parasites-- their chief vulnerability. Well, handy that we're surrounded by salt water. Talk to me about the first outbreak then. Well, parasites have been used in science for hundreds of years now. Tapeworms are utilized to keep people thin. Maggots are used for exfoliation. Parasites-- microscopic parasites can be given a simple set of instructions. They then burrow into their host and they can manipulate their DNA. We started with shellfish, engineering oysters that produced perfect, lustrous and round pearls. And money from the pearls funded further research. We set out to make the perfect human. And at first we were successful. They became strong, their senses heightened. The subjects became intuitive. But we made one major miscalculation. The parasites needed to feed and consumed the host from the inside. ( knocks ) Okay, you can't tell me that and then leave me alone in here. Gina, it'll be fine. I'll just be a minute. You're okay. But-- ( door closes ) I'm not gonna be able to keep this a secret much longer. People are gonna think-- People will think what I tell them to think. - Things have changed, Larkin. - You forget who you're talking to. Are you questioning my loyalty here, Jake? Oh, I'm questioning a lot more than that, Doc. How dare you bring Jamie onto the island without consulting me? If there's even a chance that she can bring us to the antidote, we've got to try. You still believe that fairy tale? No, this is our burden, Macavire. We said that coming in and I'm saying it now. Bringing innocents into this is madness. No, not bringing them would be. We have a larger responsibility. I wouldn't be lecturing anybody on responsibility, Doc. ( men continue arguing ) Stanley, please. It's over. It was a freak incident. It's been 20 years. That's what concerns me. You'll do as you're told. Jamie leaves now. Wouldn't be the first time you've been wrong, Larkin. Mm-hmm. ( Gina screams ) Help me! ( straining ) Help me! Help me! ( cocks gun ) Justin! - What? - You're not very good at that. You try it. I saw some townspeople today. Oh, yeah? Did you paint mustaches on their faces too? - No, actually it was really creepy-- - I don't care. Are you still mad about that? Beginner's luck. And I'm not mad. Why do you need to be alone so bad? Why can't you be? We have orders. Goody. This can't be done. You've already done it. Amanda: On shellfish. What you're talking about is something completely different. Mason: I have faith. Well, I have doubts, Mason. It's too big. It's too dangerous. And there's no time for-- Mason: Necessity is the mother of invention. Right? Jamie, stand up. Let me see how big you've gotten. Okay, look. ( knocks on door ) Coming. - Jamie Ackerman? - Yes. My name is Larkin Holberman from the city council. We know of your great uncle's passing and we wanted to extend our most heartfelt condolences. Mason was a friend. Thank you. So I'm pleased to inform you the City of Kuttyhunk has agreed to offer you $75,000 for the rights to this land. No, thank you. We have more substantial offers. From other islanders? No, from the mainland. But Miss Ackerman, you only have the rights to this property. Ownership can only be exchanged between islanders. No. I actually have this. Uh, let's see... Okay, right here, actually. In the state of Maine-- I'm afraid the local statute takes precedence in cases like this. Have you discussed this with a lawyer? No, I talked to a real estate agent. I suggest that you talk to a lawyer. Are you saying that I have no course of action? Well, you could take it up with the head of the city council. - Great. Who is that? - That would be me. This land is worth $2 million. - I'm afraid my hands are tied. - Are they? But we do have $75,000 for you. This won't even cover our debt. It's better than nothing, Miss Ackerman. Think it over. And I am truly sorry. Enjoy the ham. I was thinking about it, and I think we should just spend it all. Marco-- Humor me. How would you spend it? A 50-day 50-state shopping spree. Ooh, reckless spending. I like it. What is that? ( indistinct conversation ) ( coughing ) Hey, did you bring your medicine with you? I'm fine. Dude, you know we're alone on this island. I'm really sorry if I pissed you off or something, but we should probably try to make the best of it. We can play bullsnit. Bullsnit? It's this game where I say something, and if you think it's fake you say "bullsnit." And if it is fake, then I'll make a funny face. And if it's not fake, they you'll make a funny face. Okay, I think this game sounds dumb. How about this one? I had a thing with Marco before Jamie did. Bullsnit. - Oh my God. - Mm-hmm. Face. Kristin: Good. Justin: What happened? I can't tell you because that's not the rules of the game. Your turn. Okay, this is-- this is kind of messed up, but when me and Jamie were kids-- Wait, your dad married her mom? - Yeah. - Okay. After she left the island she came to live with us for three months. And we used to experiment sexually a little bit. Oh my God. Face. Oh my God, that was pretty good. In all seriousness though, I know I've been kind of aggressive with you, and it's because I like you. And we only have two days left, so... Kristin-- And I'm snitting. It's just I'm not the kind of guy that gets together with girls, you know, just for-- you know, that-- For fun? Yeah. It's not you. It's just, you know, 48 hours just-- I don't think, you know, probably-- Is that cool? Totally. Bullsnit. You know, I would say like, if I can drive six miles without pushing the brake, then Johnny Dexter will ask me out. And? I mean, it works usually. Like I would say, if I can hold my breath until I see a blue Prius then I would lose five pounds. And you did? No, not every time. - I wouldn't always see a blue Prius. - ( laughs ) Okay, so you're saying if I could swim across that lake, then I'll get whatever I want? No, that's not what I'm saying. There has to be an aspect of randomness to it, Iike if you could tread water until you see a bird-- --then I'll get whatever I want. - Right? - Mm-hmm. Well, okay then. Ohh-hh. - I'm doing it. - ( laughs ) Holy Christ, it is cold. Holy what? Watch out for sharks. What? Jamie: Mason and I used to play this game all the time. He called it "the hunt." It reminds me-- my uncle used to distract me. He used to stick up his left hand. And if you focus on the left hand, you don't see what the right hand is doing. That's fascinating. We're missing something. Kristin: Maybe it's not meant to be. No, I got a few more hours in me. Really? No, I'm giving up right now. Kristin: I'm getting hungry. Look! Justin: What? Oh. What does that mean? I don't know. It had to be while treading water. Really? Yeah, I don't know. It's how l-- Really? ( chuckles ) Come here. You're shivering. No, I'm fine. Here. Is that better? Yeah, thanks. - Does that help? - Yeah, I think so. Oh, I forgot that you don't hook up with girls just for fun. Screw it. I'm quick. Yeah, me too. ( exclaims ) Justin. Come here. Put your hand on my neck? That's anticlimactic. Is there anything fun? This is kind of fun. Wow, it's beautiful. ( voices whispering ) Hmm. What's in there? Pictures. Oh, wow. I got it. And now I'd like to introduce the man of the hour and someone I am proud to call my friend, Mason Lane. I know this. - Mason: Thank you. - This is important. Mason: Before we continue, I should acknowledge my niece Amanda Lane, without whom this would not have been possible. Jamie, you guys, something's wrong with Justin. Now in order for lntercorps to continue to expand at its desired rate, we need to think bigger. We need to think global. We need to think evolution. Behind this curtain-- ( crash ) ( screaming ) ( all shouting ) Mason: We need to think evolution. Parasites feed on adrenalin. And once they acquire the taste, they grow, consuming it from the host. This perfect strand will be ready in months;, not years, not decades-- in months. It is the key to our continued evolution. Intercorps can bring this to the world. Imagine the possibilities. I beg you not to stop us from completing our task. It is Adam's rib. Was he breathing? I don't know. He was scared. He just started shaking, so I came to get you guys. Where were you? It was right here. Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin! What's going on, buddy? Can you talk? I'm so cold. It's ripping me. ( screams ) - What was that? - We gotta get him to camp, come on. - What the fuck was that? - You're scaring him. Help me out. ( coughing ) I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. We're gonna get you help. Marco: Help me out. Help me out. Tell me exactly what happened. We were near the water and then he went into the water. - Maybe the lake's contaminated. - Did you see that thing in his stomach? - I saw it too, maybe a muscle spasm. - Is he getting sick again? - Let's not think that. - Did you see any signs? - I don't know what to look for. - Where are his pills? - Jamie: He gets shots now. - Marco: He needs a doctor. I'm getting help. ( grunting ) ( Jamie knocking ) Sarah, there's something wrong with Justin. I'm gonna run down to the dock, see if I get any service. I should clean off maybe. Yeah, it's fine. He's not going anywhere. I'll be back soon. Hang in there, buddy. ( door closes ) Are we being followed? Jamie: This is the closest place with a phone? Sarah: Yeah. I'll be right back. ( knocking ) Hello? Hello, is anyone there? Please, my brother is sick. Can I just use your phone? Please. ( knocking ) I can see you. Please, I just need your help. My brother is sick. Hello? I can see you. Please, my brother is sick. ( humming a tune ) ( Justin wheezes ) - Jamie: Should we go to the cops? - Sarah: They're idiots. We're not going to the cops. Dr. Mac will know what to do. ( playing accordion ) ( man breathing deeply ) ( stops playing ) ( air hissing ) ( man breathing deeply ) ( water running ) Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. Nam myoho renge kyo. ( continues chanting ) ( continues chanting ) ( door squeaks ) ( screams ) Are you okay? You're better now. Me? I'm fine. Did you break the door? Uh... ( chuckles ) - You got a little-- - What? - A little something. - Oh. I don't think you finished, but I'll do it for you. A little mustache. A mustache. ( woman speaks indistinctly ) Really? Kristin: What? Well, round two? The shower's ready. Jamie: Dr. Mac's house, right? Sarah: Yeah. - Wait. - What? Look. Kristin over walkie-talkie: Hello? Hey, it's Jamie. Kristin: Thank God. I've been trying to reach you for, like, five minutes. Justin is okay. What happened? I don't know. He just-- he got better. Really? That's great. We're headed home. ( walkie-talkie hisses ) Hello, is anybody out there? Can you hear me? Hello, is anybody out there? Can you read me? ( clock ticking ) ( clock ticking louder ) ( ticking loudly ) ( ticking quieter ) ( muffled voice speaks ) ( dog barking ) - Man: Oh, yeah. - ( wood creaking ) ( man and woman moaning ) ( Kristin breathing deeply ) ( clock ticking quietly ) ( heart beating ) ( noises stop ) I'm sleeping. ( rock music playing, people chattering ) What can I do you for? Whiskey. Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt, but can I talk to you for a second? I'm busy here. I've never really done this before, but I see you with your friends, surrounded by all this stuff, these people, and I don't know, you seem interesting. Really? I could be totally wrong, but I see someone who's stuck, wanting, waiting to get away from here, to be something, someone whom you forgot to be. This guy, man. He's treating you poorly. You should leave him. I'm not saying that I can help you get there or anything. I just feel like maybe we're the same, you know? Two little people wanting a chance to be different. Yeah, you got me all figured out. No. No. Please, this is ridiculous. - Really? - Yeah. Then why is your heart racing? ( rapid heartbeat ) Is there a problem? Only if you want one. - You okay? - I'm fine, Andy. Yeah? I don't think so. I saw this guy physically grabbing on you. As if there's any other way. What did you say? I said you're a small-town boy who should be moving on now. You're the one who needs moving, pussy. I sure as shit ain't gonna let you sit here and put your filthy hands all over my girl. Well, I'm sorry. You're right. Goddamn right I'm right. We should go outside. You guys, this is so stupid. Shut up. This asshole can't just walk in here with his stupid-ass sunglasses and act like he owns the place, no. You can walk away from this. ( chuckles ) You sure do talk tough. Why don't you show me what you got? But that's not how it works. You have to come to me. 'Cause you're scared? ( laughs ) That's what I thought. Hey! No harm no foul. Have a drink on me. Seriously, guys, I don't want to hurt you. All right. This has been fun. That was incredible. No no. He's drunk. Come on, let's go, okay? Wait wait, let me see your eyes. - You're freezing. - I'm fine. - What is this? - It's nothing. What is this? - It's nothing. - ( straining ) ( knocks on door ) Just a second. Rise and shine, sleepyhead. You didn't have to do that. Oh, yes, I did. You had us worried there for a minute. Yeah. But you're better. Much. Here you go. Your mom used to make my dad breakfast in bed. What? Yes, she would-- she would cut a flower and put it in a vase and surround it with salt and pepper shakers and make egg in the hole. Yeah, egg in the hole. I remember that she did that the day that they talked. She didn't know that I was there. I was just playing by the side of the bed and-- And she said that every time she looked at me she thought about my mom and how much he loved her. And then-- and then she said that she couldn't stand it anymore. And a few days later they-- they came to pick me up. And-- yeah. You know, you should be glad you didn't grow up in that house. It was not good. Justin, we're not getting money. What? I thought I could handle it, but-- I wanted to get you that treatment. It's stupid, I know. No. No, it's not stupid. Jamie, you're my sister. Step-sister. But you're my blood. Are you okay? ( panting ) Are you okay? Yeah. I guess I'm not 100% yet. Where's Kristin? Okay. Thanks. ( screaming ) ( footsteps ) - How's it going? - Good. Just chopping away. Looking good. Thanks. I, uh... This is awkward. You're Jamie's only family and-- ( screeching ) My God, why is this so hard? Um... I-- what I was asking is-- I was asking for Jamie's hand in marriage. Wow. Yeah, it's-- this isn't easy for me. Look at me. I'm a mess. Relax. - I mean, I brought the ring. - ( screeching ) You know, I wasn't gonna ask, but everything's been so tense around here that I thought, you know, maybe I would, you know-- Listen, I'm late for meeting Kristin by the lake, but I'm happy to be brothers. ( exhales ) ( screams ) ( whispering ) Hello, Jamie? Anybody? Hello? Kristin over walkie-talkie: Jamie, hello? Jamie? ( turns off sound ) Can you hear me? ( twig snaps ) ( screaming ) - Hey. - Hey. Do you want to open a military supply shop? - We're not getting the money. - Huh? There was some ordinance. And I tried to fix it, but it got all messed up. And there weren't any phones. God, Marco. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's okay. Listen, we can open a flea market. - I want you to relax. - Really? Yeah, as long as you handle the fleas. I don't like bugs. I was so nervous to tell you. Well, speaking of nerves... - ( knocks on door ) - Yes? Excuse me. Is someone here sick? - Who wants to know? - I found this note on my door. Dr. Macavire. Jamie Ackerman. I used to play with your granddaughter. Oh, yes, absolutely, of course. It's great to see you again. The note says that your brother is unwell. Are you he? No, he just left a minute ago. - Hmm, that's a speedy recovery. - Yeah, it was, actually. Muscle spasms, shortness of breath, disorientation, complaints of cold? - How did you know? - He just left, you say? - Yeah. - Where? How long ago? To the lake, about five minutes ago. We can catch up to him-- He's on foot on the trail to the lake. - What are you doing? - Jamie, are these his sunglasses? Jamie, he's diseased. He's very sick. And I need to see him right away. For what? - To help him, of course. - ( footsteps ) What's with all the heavy artillery? He already attacked one woman, killed her. She was last seen with him. Those glasses were found next to the body. - That doesn't prove anything. - No, of course not, but it does raise suspicions. - Come on. - Jamie. Kristin! Kristin! ( men chattering ) ( Jamie exclaims ) ( grunts ) ( muffled screaming ) - Gun! - ( two gunshots ) You're gonna kill us all. No, man, just you. Look at him. He's sick. ( muffled scream ) ( cocks gun ) ( screams ) ( screams ) ( muffled screaming ) I'm sorry. Oh my God. Darren Francis Roberts, Mary's son, three kids, a good man. ( gunshot ) That he was. How is this happening, Doc? A half-life maybe. I don't know. Tape 'em. Jake-- ( water dripping ) Feeling better? What is this place? It's our sanctuary. Who are you? It's me, sweetheart. Welcome home. Oh my God. Mason. Oh God. You've grown. Look. One of God' overlooked gifts to humanity, Iike me. ( hissing, creature screeching ) This will keep you safe. Mason, I can't do this anymore. I know. - What are you doing? - What needs to be done. Now she has to give us the antidote. You've lost it, Mason. Tell me where the antidote is so I can save you. I destroyed it. You killed her. Mason: This solution helps to keep the parasites at bay. ( Mason moans ) Your mother had developed an antidote that could have stopped all of this. But it doesn't matter now. Even if you do know where it is, you are the only one. What's gonna happen to Justin? I've been watching you. I needed a diversion to get you here alone. This is the place where your mother and I designed to evolve mankind. I have devoted my life to that goal. But I became old and ill. I had to infect myself in order to survive. But I'm close. Any day now my work will be complete. When I was stationed here with the task of evolving mankind-- That's enough! No! ( pounding ) Hello? Can anyone hear me? ( distant sirens wailing ) Go through sections 1, 3 and 6. See if there are any survivors and bring them here. Sections 4, 8 and 11 have all been overrun. Larkin, my father lives in 11. - Jamie over walkie-talkie: Hello? - No. Hello? Can anyone hear me? Jamie, is that you? Thank God. I'm trapped in a laboratory with Mason Lane. Whoever you are, I need your help. Jamie, listen, I know where you are. Get out and find someplace to hide. I'm on my way. You take care of them. I'll deal with this. ( man screaming ) ( crash ) ( panting ) Man: Somebody help me! ( crash ) Man: Help! ( footsteps ) ( keys jingle ) ( lock rattles ) ( light switch clicks ) It's over, Jamie. Come out. It's over. Mason. Ah, coming to touch greatness again? No, I came to see the man who spoke of greatness but never understood what that meant. Let's put an end to this. I came unarmed. That was a mistake. Stop. ( moans ) - It's over. - Yes. No. ( screaming ) ( coughing, grunting ) God damn it all, it shouldn't have come to this. We're in the business of helping mankind, not killing innocent people. And you shouldn't even be here. God damn Macavire Iuring you out here with some made-up inheritance story. Wait, why would he do that? Because he wanted the antidote to stop the outbreak - and he thought you had it. - What about you trying to get rid of me for 75 grand? I was trying to save you, to get you away from all this. Save me? You and Mason killed my mother. No, sweetheart, I came back for you. It was me that got you off the island. Your mother died trying to stop that lunatic. She knew that the antidote was the only thing that could stop his master plan. If you do have the antidote, this island is the last place you should be. Your mother-- ( tires screech ) - ( car honking continuously ) - ( baby crying ) Is that Sarah's car? ( baby crying ) Okay. Larkin: You got it? Jamie: Yeah. Shh. ( honking stops ) Shh. Let's get you out of here. It's okay. Shh. ( screams ) ( gagging ) ( baby crying ) There should be a gas can in here somewhere. What is this place? We preserve the pearls with salt and ship them around the world. Come on. That's what all these people are doing on the island. We've got a ready-built-- Here, fill the engine. I'll be right back. Just go do it now. Go. You don't have to do this. ( screeching ) Wait. Please. ( screams ) If you're looking at the left hand, you don't see me. Wait. Wait. Wait. Please. Jamie, don't go. Please don't leave me here. Come back. I don't want this. Jamie. Jamie! ( sneezes ) ( exclaims ) ( boat horn toots ) This will keep you safe. ( baby fussing ) Man over radio: Boat 0110, abandoned boat off starboard bow. It appears to have one infant passenger onboard, no adults. Over. Female dispatcher: 3249, confirm sole infant onboard. Over. Man: 0110, visual confirmation of an infant onboard. Request permission to pursue rescue. Over. ( woman continues shouting ) ( ominous music playing ) ( waves crashing )
