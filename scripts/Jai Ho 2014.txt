That's when someone abducted him. He's been found now. Thank the Lord that he was found safe and sound. Yes. Jai, you've dune a great job. Thank you and God bless you. Seriously, how do we repay this favor? How can we help? If you feel... we've done you a favor. Then don't say thank you. Instead...help three people. And...ask those three, to help another three people. I didn't get you, son. Hold this. Just like I helped you, you will help three more people. And you will ask them to help three more people. So 3 into 3 is 9. Into 3...27. 27 into 3 is 81. When 81 people help 3 more... - 243. Into 3? 729 . When 729 people help.. - 2187. Into 3. - 6561. Into 3? - 19683. Into 3? - 59049. 59049 into 3? - 170,147. And if 170, 147 people help 3 more? And when they help three more? Then we'll have to call Shakuntala Devi. 4,30,46,721. Correct? - That's correct. Wow! And similarly this help chain.. ...will grow from thousands to millions. Son, that's a great idea. We will definitely help three people when we get the chance. Amazing.

Are you Geeta's brother? - Yes. But she's gone to the market. I suggest that you come and wait here. Come on. He's a good match for Rinky. Come. Come in. Geeta and me, we're more friends than family.

How can I assist you, sir? This pillow's such a nuisance. Where does mother get these from? You fool! What are you doing? What's wrong? - Look behind. What? Spice...tea! Jai. What are you doing here? Geeta. Physical touch. Wait. What, Jai.. - Nothing. Her daughter was mistaken. She mistook me for Kabir. You? You two know each other? Yes, I know you. It's you. Inside the theatre, small girl, pink.. Pink? - Okay, sorry. Pink is our favorite. Inky-pinky-ponky. Let's go. Kabir must be waiting. He's a nice boy. Geeta. What does your brother do? He was in the army. Was? Mother. I guess he got scared and ran away. Let's go. Come on. Stupid girl. Don't talk nonsense. Let's go. Sister, I am really sorry. The reason my brother left the military.. ...was his bravery, not cowardice. Captain. Captain. Captain, come in. - Yes, sir. We have lost a lot of men Leave that area now. End the mission right now. - No, sir. Innocent children have been taken as hostage. Soldier, control your anger. Sir, try and understand. Civilians are involved here. It's the high-command's orders. You have to fall back. Get down, dammit. Get down now. Clear the area now. Captain Arjun, come in. Abort this mission right now. This is High-command's order. Listen to me. "Jai ho!" "Jai ho!" And Jai was suspended from the army.. ...for not obeying the High Command's orders. Sorry, sister. It's okay. - Thank you. No thank you, help three people out. Whenever you get a chance. And ask them to help three more people. Yes. That's Jai's ideology. You don't have to be in the army.. ...or be a politician to serve the country. He's a good man. "Your eyes are so stunning... they'll pierce my heart." "Your eyes are so stunning... they'll pierce my heart." "With your killer attitude " "You make my heart laugh, make it cry." "They'll pierce my heart one day "Your eyes.." "Your eyes are so lethal." "Your eyes.." "Your eyes are so lethal." "Your eyes.." "With your killer attitude.." "You make my heart laugh, make it weep." "They'll pierce my heart one day " "Your eyes are so stunning... they'll pierce my heart." "Your eyes misbehave." "And makes my heart crave." "Slowly these events move ahead." "Your memories... make up my moments." "I feel peace in your arms." "I feel peace.." "With your killer attitude.." "You make my heart laugh, make it weep." "They'll pierce my heart one day." "Your eyes are so stunning... they'll pierce my heart." "Your eyes.." "Are stunning.." "Your eyes.." What do I say, sister? He says such things over the phone" ...which I cannot tell you. Such vile and disgusting things. I can't believe that.. ...a man can say such things about a woman. Not just that. He knows things about Simran, like.. Harjeet, please. Before we complained to the police.. ...we wanted to meet you. Complaint taken. That's him. - Give me. Lots of money, you know. Hold on, it's an important call. Yes, Jai. Where are you? Trying to sell my plan to a Chinese man. Hey mister, I am from Nepal not China. Nepal's that way, behind the mountain. Get lost. Yes, Jai. Listen, you have an influence.. ...in the telephone exchange, don't you? Find out where this number's coming from. If he calls again, then keep talking. - Okay. Talk to him. Listen to his crap, don't disconnect. Hello. - Hi, my love. Why don't you understand, mister? Hello, Jai. I know. Hello. - Hello. I think it's your brother's voice. I guess yourjob's done. Is that him? - Doctor? He's my family doctor Kapadia. What? Being a doctor yourself.. I'll make sure your licensee's cancelled. Thank you for everything you did for us. No need to thank us. Help three people whenever you get a chance in life. Best of luck. Of course. Bye, sister. - Bye. Come. BYE, guys. Let's meet next week. Be safe, and don't drink and drive. Sir, he's drunk. He does that every day. Uncle. Is there anyone with you? - No, I am alone. Uncle, it's quite late. Go home. I am tired of waiting for a rickshaw or taxi. But no one's prepared to go to Vasant Nagar. I'll take a look. Rickshaw! Come, uncle. The rickshaw's here. Come. Careful. Very good. Where do you want to go? Where to? Uncle. Uncle, give him your address. Cottage no.5. Vasant Nagar, West. My rickshaw's from Mira Nagar. And I don't get a fare back. Find yourself another rickshaw. Let it be, he's old and also drunk. So, will he get in my rickshaw? I won't get a return fare either. Where will he go at this late hour? Fine, let's go. Thank you. 'No need to thank me.' 'Just help three people whenever you get a chance.' Uncle, no need to thank me.' Just help three people whenever you get a chance. We've reached your home. You brought me to the right place. From today I am your fixed client. - Great. Keep it. Thank you. On 'Jan-Manch' today we're talking.. ...about security of WIP.. Better learn these chores, Ann. It will come in handy after marriage, dear. By the way, it's not important for me. But it will be great if she learns it. How hard are you going to try, Sumit? Mom, you too. Hold on, let me hear. How justified is it spend the common man's earning like this. And other than that, when VIP convoy's ...set out on roads, the common man has to face difficulties. We'll now talk to our Chief Minister Ashok Pradhan. So, Mr. Ashok Pradhan, what would you like to say? You know, honestly. Security measures shouldn't trouble the people ...or it should trouble them as less as possible Unfortunately, politicians are human beings too. And human beings make mistakes. The only problem, when a politician makes a mistake ...the common man has to pay for it. What do you think about the new CM? He's given a diplomatic answer. The most important issue is.. ...when people misuse the security system. We'll take strict actions against them. There's a positive vibe. He looks like a nice man. Good man. What's the point if he is a nice man? He's a puppet after all. No, he's a nice man. I heard it too. Forget that. Jai, give me your hand. Shake hands. I did it. Jai's formula, to help three people ...instead of saying thank you. I spread that ahead. Come on, food's ready. Let's eat. Have you heard the latest about him? Quiet. - What happened? He has donated his eyes. And owing to his actions these days.. ...seems like someone will soon get an eyesight. Shut That's the limit. Curse you. Look, Jai, I want to explain you something. Not everyone in this world is like you. - Are you crazy? And given to the conditions these days.. ...everyone's busy with their own problems. Everyone will willingly vouch to help. But no one will do it. And look, Jai. You've to make me a promise. If your idea doesn't prosper.. ...then you won't be disappointed. I won't be, mom. Chill. What chill.. Really. This thought is so nice and noble.. ...that I definitely want to help. But I just got married. And that's why I was very busy. So I didn't get a chance or time. But as soon as I get some time or opportunity.. ...I will definitely help. - No problem. We haven't forgotten what you did. We even remember your thought. We want to take it forward too. But the past few days.. ...we've been doing rounds of the visa and passport office. My son Ronnie and his wife.. ...are migrating to Canada. No one helps anyone here, or wants to. Everyone's busy with their own problem. Some are worried about a job, some about finding a girl. I've seen the world. I speak straight. Some will say sweetly, some will say it decently. Some will say "I want to help you". Ask him... did you do anything? Did you? He'll say "I didn't do anything". You're living in an illusion.. ...that something's going to happen. Nothing's going to happen. Fine, sir. The times are bad. No one helped anyone. Why don't you start? It might make you happy. Nonsense! Sorry, sir. I shouldn't have said that to you. I apologies. Sir. Sir.. Sir. This is yours. This is yours. Oh no. Come on. I'm packed too. Forget it. Jai, whether anyone does anything or not. We will try. Yes. Sir, I am hungry. Please give something. - I said get lost. I am hungry. - Get lost. Who talks to a child that way? Sir, I am hungry. Give me some money. I said get lost. Jai. f; . Jai, listen to me. Jai. Child. Sumit, she's bleeding. What have you done? - What's your problem? Jai, leave it. - Problem.. Hey! Oh, God! Stop it. We're trying to help three people here, and you.. Forget it. Jai, let him go. Jai, central yourself. Take it easy. Get lost. Just chill. Poor girl. Just chill. I won't spare you. Get lost. Jai, you hit the window. I didn't see it was closed. Tend to the child. Are you fine? It's a minor injury. There's a limit to being cruel. What happened, dear? Mister. Mister! Who are you? - I am her father. Father? What father? He was playing cards. He's hale and healthy. You're absolutely fine, and making your child beg. What kind of a father are you? - Jai. Jai. Jai. I told you to relax. Do one thing, apply this. - Yes. Look after yourself, dear. Come on. What's wrong? - Why is brother-in-law so depressed? Something happened? Nothing, he picked a fight on the road. With whom? Forget it brother-in-law. You know Jai. What's wrong, Jai? I am disturbed, what else? Look at the chain of events. One after the other. A girl whom I helped out of the blue.. "Committed suicide in front of me. I find a kidnapped boy. A poor girl gets beaten up while begging. The more I try to run from reality.. Why do only I see these things? Everyone sees them, Jai. Others ignore it. You must have heard people saying. "I went out of my way to help him." This "Out of the way" is your way. Because that's who you are. And that's what separates you from the rest. You're not meant to spend.. ...the rest of your life in a garage. You will bring a change. I believe it. How and when, we just have to wait and watch. I believe it. Evil is like poison, it spreads fast. And goodness, is like a medicine. It takes time, but it's effective. Cheers. Fatty, why don't you come to school these days? The school's too far, I've to walk. I get tired. Here, take my cycle. This will help you exercise, and no more excuses. Thank you. - Don't say thank you. Just help three people whenever you get the chance. And ask them to help more three people. Get that. Hey, uncle. - Get lost. Where are you, darling? I've been waiting for you. Wow, mom. What a place. I love this place. - Isn't it? Hey, this was my idea. Uncle, I love you. Love you. - He's so audacious. What is he made of? I'll call you later. Uncle, let's go. Come on, uncle. Don't be so slow, uncle. Faster, uncle. That guys' here with his family at Wonderland. Get here quickly. We'll take care of him today. Strawberry flavor, uncle. Uncle, since the theatre.. ...you really like pink, don't you. Pink? What song is this? Mom, Pink Panther. You.. - You what? Peanut. Peanut? I'll show you. "My name's pinky." Kabir, let's go. Time for your tuitions. Come on, I'll take you. - "Pinky.." And time for mom's walk as well. Yes, I'll take her too. Bye, Pinky. - Bye. I mean Rinky. Bye, Pinky. Bye, Pinky. Hey, Rinky. Now your name's Pinky. Pinky. Pinky. Pinky. Pinky. Where is he? - You're late. He just left. You said his family's with him. They're inside. Out everyone. Hey, leave her. Don't make that mistake. Call your brother. Jai. Jai. Hold him! How dare you roar! Madhav! Idiot. Who is he? Hello. Hello, Manik speaking. What happened? I came here to help that idiot Madhav.. ...with 10 men. But only 3 are left. How many are they? - He's all alone. What was that? He's an animal. He's clawing, and biting like a madman. Wherever you are, just get him to our nearest party-office. We'll turn his roar into his scream. I'll try. Jai. Go home! No, Jai! Jai! Jai! Stop him. - Yes, sir. Jai sir. Sir, look. What do we see, Rajput sir? There's been no crime or FIR. Let something happen first, that's how we'll benefit. If you want to progress in life.. ...then learn to stand after the no-entry and signal. If you stand before it, you'll be left empty-handed. Where have I gotten stuck? Manik sir. - Let go. Let go. Who are you? I am the one whose sister you tried to dishonor. Sir. Look, my brother's no goon. In fact, he was in the army and served the country. Madam, we don't like arresting him. But what to do, we're bounded by the law. Madam, the FIR's been lodged. His felony has been registered. If we release him, our jobs will be at stake. There's a lot of pressure on us. My advice is, find a good lawyer. And bail him out soon, otherwise.. ...he will have to stay here until Monday. Sorry, madam. So, it's you. Let him out. Sir, the FIR's been registered. Only the court can grant him bail. Tear it. - Yes, sir. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, you said we can lose our jobs. You won't lose your job. Instead you'll be promoted. Send him out Sir.. - Shut up. You broke his hand. Now my men will break you. Yes! Give here. No. Get up! We cannot trust him. He's gone berserk. Run, save your lives. What are you doing? Run. Run. Get out of here. What happened? Run, run. Run away quickly. Jump, jump quickly. Come here. Come on. First you beg us for votes.. ...and later squash us like bugs. You think a decent man is coward. A respected man's afraid. An honest man's stupid. The common man's a sleeping lion. Don't try to poke him. If he wakes up... He'll tear you apart. "Jai ho!" Brother. Papa, what are you thinking? After what he did to us, his punishment is death. Death. People like him die only if you humiliate them. Make a circle around the dog. Make a circle. I'm going to Delhi for two days. As soon as I return.. Okay- Brother. What's wrong with, father? We had to face so much, and he's quiet about it. Let me show you something. Who is he? He's the handicapped girl's brother.. ...who went to lodge an FIR against you. And I did this to him on father's orders. Now imagine...what we'll do with Jai Agnihotri. Hello. Hello. - Who is it? Give the phone to Geeta? Sister's not at home. Talk to me. I am doing it? Why didn't you come see me all these days? When are we meeting? When is Sumit arriving? - In half an hour. Half an hour. - Okay. Half an hour. Let's meet at the Country Club. What. What's your favorite color? What color should be the bumper? - Black. Okay, done. Who was it? Wrong number. Where's my black dress? Mom! - Stupid. Why are you making a mess? Where's my black dress? - With the laundryman. Thank you. You asked me to wear black. How is it? Isn't it a bit loose? - Really? But you like black, don't you? Are you happy? I am happy... to see you so comfortable. For your happiness, I will wear black, drink black. Black coffee. Thief Blackout. Trying to impress my uncle with my clothes. Sometimes pink, sometimes black. What's your plan? Are you hitting on my uncle? Uncle, she's hitting on you. Be quiet. - Uncle, she's a thief. These are my clothes. What? Your clothes? - Yes. No wonder you're looking so comfortable in these clothes. Uncle, if it wasn't for you.. ...then I would've taken my clothes back. But let it be. I don't want to ruin your setting here. - I see. Uncle. Look, she has stretched out my T-shirt. And.. And she's eating cheese sandwich. I will...deal with you later. Come on, madam. Look back to the pavilion. Are these black clothes yours? - No. You like...black coffee. Yuck. Disgusting. Then what's all this for? Only for you. Only for me. Only for you. "You had to come in my life." "Why did you take so long?" "I've lived only fer you." "Whatever I do it's only for you." "Because I...love you." "I love you." "Because I...love you." "I'll love you till the end." "Each dawn...starts with you." "All day long I keep thinking about you." "I'll forsake every happiness in this world." "Only for you.". "Because I...love you." "I'll love you till the end." "No matter what happens, I'll always love you." "I am with you at every step." "As long as I breathe, I want to live only for you." "Because I...love you." "I love you." "Because I...love you." "I'll love you till the end." What stupid photos you show me, priest. If my son was supposed to marry such weird girls.. ...then, he would've been married 10 times by now. Madam, Jai's got a bad Tuesday? - What? I mean his stars are not favorable. That's why his marriage is getting delayed. But don't worry. I'll get him married in 10 years... I mean 10 days. He's making you a fool. He isn't married himself. How can he get uncle married? You said you're married. And you have two children. Yes, I do. I have two children. They might be mine. No, they are mine. And your wife? I do have a wife, but we got a small divorce. - Small? Listen to me, it was a mistake. What happened one day was.. ...I reached home before time. I rang the bell. I went inside and saw, that my poor wife.. ...was resting with our building's watchman. They got disturbed because I rang the bell. And that's why marriage was disrupted. See, he couldn't handle his own wife.. ...how can he get uncle married? Idiot. My child's right. He'll get hurt. - My child's right. Wow! The child took mercy. He knows I'll get hurt. - Move! Not you, my grandma will get hurt. Hold this. What are you doing? Hit him with this. Yes, son. Are you a boy or a demon? - Demon. Demon. - Beat him. You dare call him a demon. Grandma, don't get involved with these priests. Uncle has already found a girl for himself. What? Where is she? How is she? Actually.. Grandma, that's her. She's so cute. She looks sophisticated. Shall we go? - Yes. Does your mother know her? Yes. She's our crazy neighbor. She's so ugly. Useless girl. I don't want a girl like her. Come on, grandma. - No. Come on, meet her once. - No. Come meet her, grandma. You are becoming very mischievous. - No, grandma, please. Let me go, let go. - She's very beautiful. Do you like my son? - What? If it's a yes, then stay away from her. Ask her, who else will she ask to stay away? All that I don't know But if you don't stay away from her.. ...then, you're rejected. Rejected! You're only harming yourself. I know, so I am going to suffer. Tell her, she's sensible, isn't she? If she's so sensible, then better explain my son. God knows what he's up to these days. I am worried about him. Tell her. He even listens to her. What is this? They trouble me a lot. This is your doing, isn't it? I will show you. Look where you're going. Mother. Mother. Mother. Doctor. There's a serious complication. - What happened? The accident caused internal bleeding.. ...and its damaged her kidney. Oh my god! We'll have to transplant her kidney right now.. ...but we need a donor. Were there. - Yes, but.. Only after conducting certain tests.. ...we'll know whose kidney matches. Mother. Congratulations. One of your family member's kidney.. ...has matched with yours. You? - No, mother. Did...Geeta.. Excuse me. Did Rehan.. - Yes, mother. Our kidney didn't match, Rehan's did. I've tormented you so much because of my naivety. And ta myself. No need to remember the past and hurt yourself. Everything is fine now. We'll live together now. With love. And we'll spread so much love.. ...and forget all our sorrows in the past. What are you doing there? Yes. Come here. Come. I apologies for the other day.. - Grandma, don't apologies. Her kidney matched with yours.. ...yet she refused to donate hers. No aunt, he's lying. Shut up, Tiny.. - Shut up, Pink Panther. Aunty.. Aunty.. Aunty.. Rehan's calling you, mother. He's calling some aunty, not me. Call me aunty again.. ...and I'll hurl another file at you. I thought mothers were the law. But now you're my mother-in-law... - Hello. I heard that your mother survived. She survived because.. ...she still has to witness many deaths. Hello. Who is it? - Kavita Patil. And listen, your mother didn't meet with an accident. She was knocked down intentionally, get that? Jai, what are you going to do now? Who do you think you are? You're no longer in the army. These people are a system, Jai. And you cannot fight alone. If you do something, then tomorrow they'll retaliate. Today it was mother.. ...tomorrow it can be Rehan. Then Kabir then me. When will this chain end, Jai. Stop this. Everything's back to normal after so many years. Mother's back in my life. End this fight here, Jai. Even if you have to apologies. Or do anything else. Please. For my sake. Locking at his attitude.. ...it doesn't seem like he's here to apologies. Singh sir. We're here to end this matter. Forgive us, please. I am a little weak-sighted. I can't see his face clearly. Come closer. A little more. That's it. Move to your right. A little more. Stop there. A little up front. Enough, stop. Look. I made him stand in the dog circle. Are you happy now? - No, papa. Just like he publicly humiliated your son-in-law.. ...similarly, he should be humiliated too. Fine. You can vent your anger too. Go on. You should've known about me.. ...before picking a fight with my family. A reporter wrote wrong things about me. Really bad things. We severed his hands. A foolish judge... was trying to scare us with the law. We severed his tongue. When I was the defense minister.. ...and my post was under threat. I staged a terrorist attacks. Some of our soldiers died in the counter attack. And then I propagated my love for the country. I didn't just save my post, but also got promoted. Few days ago. A handicapped girl committed suicide. Her brother tried to raise a voice against my daughter. Regrettably, we had to send him to his sister. Jai! Papa. Hey, let him go. I said leave him. Let go. Dashrath Singh. The world isn't just round, it's small too. Your despicable actions.. ...hurt common people like us. And you have no clue about it. But this time...you locked horns with the wrong man. If you ever try to do anything wrong, then.. ...my brother won't just make you stand in that circle ...he'll beat you like an animal too. My sister... never lies. "Jai ho!" Here you go. Goodnight. See you tomorrow at 9 o'clock, at same place. I won't come tomorrow. Get someone else to cater to you. What do you mean? What do I say? I am selling this rickshaw tomorrow. Find yourself another rickshaw driver. Why are you selling your rickshaw? My daughter wants to take admission.. ...in a good college. And they're asking for a high donation. So, I have don't have any option" ...other than selling my rickshaw. I am not a rich man. How much? - Let it be sir. No, tell me. How much? It's too high. 20, 000 rupees Hold on. I finally received my pension after so many years. 60,000 rupees. Keep it. - I.. Keep it. And...get your daughter admitted in a good college. Make her a good officer. If I keep this.. And a young boy once told me.. Try helping someone, it'll make you happy. I tried. It really makes one happy. Thank you. Don't thank me. Now when you get a chance.. ...you help three people. And ask those three to help three more people. The wcrld will change. See you. See you. As the president of the youth association of this party.. ...I should be handling the election rally, Singh sir. And you're given this responsibility to this Verma. We don't need a weak and fallen leader in this party. This is wrong, Singh sir. - Quiet! Now you'll tell me right and wrong. The truth is... that you've lost faith in yourself. Jai has shaken you and your belief. He spoke too much, papa. - No, son. He spoke the truth. Before anyone else tries to raise his head.. ...crush Jai Agnihotri's entire family. Finish them. See, madam. Their marriage has been fixed. - Yes. I just want Jai to get married now. Then I'll be rid of all my worries. I will forsake these earthly bonds" ...and go relax in Bangkok. Bangkok! Idiot, you want to go to Bangkok. Morn! Hello. Hey Tiny, isn't anyone at home? - No, Pink Panther. You sound so happy? Anyone getting married? - No, engaged. Who is he talking to? - I don't know. Uncle. What did you say? Engaged? Your uncle? Didn't you get the card? Oh no. very bad. Hang up. lam playing a game. My game's over, give the phone to your uncle. Why did you lie? I didn't lie. He's my uncle too. And anyway, she's yours. You deal with her. It's okay. - Kabir. Naughty boy, come here. Hello. - Cheater. Fraud. You idiot. Aren't you ashamed? Stay there, I'm coming right away to teach you a lesson. Come on. Are you . - MonPnay Dandiya? Rinky! Here you go. Madam, change. - Keep it. Thank you, madam. - No need to thank me. Help three people, and ask them to help three more. Curse him. Let me see how you get engaged to her. You sang, danced, and dated.. What are you looking at? With me. And now you're getting engaged to someone else. And, could you find only her in the entire world? But I won't be fooled so easily. Is this a joke? Tiny, why are you doing this with me? Sister, you knew everything. And aunt, you called me your daughter-in-law. All of you. All of you are involved in this? And you.. Have you gone crazy? She's abusing my son. No, no, it's 'Gando'. GAND...O. In Gujarati it means crazy. What's the female of that? IfGandi!II She's gone crazy. Poor girl. Pinky. - Terrible. Come on. We fooled you. What fun. Pink Panther. "The boy's gone crazy."

And in the event, many people from your party.. ...were injured. Fine, take action against.. ...whoever is responsible for this incident.

Children, let me tell you a small story. It's an interesting story, and it also has a lesson. A man called 5 children.. ...and gave each one a stick and said.. "Children, break the stick you're holding." The children easily broke the sticks. Now the man gathered all five sticks.. ...and handed it to one child and said. "Son, now try to break them." The boy tried, but he couldn't break the five sticks. So that's the strength of unity and bonding. And this strength can solve big.. Sir...what happened? Are you okay, sir?

All set to leave, Anjali have you finished After that Jai lost his mental balance. He kidnapped the CM and started to flee. My workers ran after him, to save the CM. He was beating up everyone. Look here. Here. I was hurt too. He's a terrorist. He's a terrorist. He's not just crazy. Now we know, that he used to work in the army.

Your brother tried to kill the Chief Minister. What would you like to say? Look... whatever they're showing or telling.. ...about my brother is a lie. He risked his life to save the CM. They say that your brother's.. ...mental condition is unstable. The Home Minister has declared him a terrorist. What would you like to say about this? My brother's an honest man. He thinks it's not necessary to don a uniform.. ...to serve our country. He started a goodness chain. Instead of saying thank you, help three people. And ask them to help three more people. How can anyone say.. ...that such a man's mind is unstable. Papa. She's saying the same thing.. ...that sweet aunt said in school. Help three people instead of saying thank you.

You are still critical. No. Sir, but" Doctor... don't worry about me. But save him. Jai! If I am safe and sound right now.. ...its all because of Jai. But Home Minister Dashrath Singh was saying.. Dashrath Singh is lying. In fact Dashrath Singh has lost his mind. Dashrath Singh tried to killed me.. ...and blamed Jai Agnihotri for it. People like Dashrath Singh are the real terrorist. Dashrath Singh is the real enemy of the society. Not Jai Agnihotri. Hey old man! You don't know who you slapped. Move back. Don't touch me. Get back. Guards! Security! Get me out of here. Save me.
