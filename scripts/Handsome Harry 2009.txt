THAT'S RIGHT. - WELL, I STILL REMEMBER WHEN YOU LOST YOUR CHERRY THAT NIGHT IN CIUDAD TRUJILLO TO THE BEST-LOOKING WHORE I'VE EVER SEEN. - YEAH, WELL, YOURS WASN'T SO BAD EITHER. - THAT'S TRUE. YOU REMEMBER THE NIGH KAGAN TOOK US TO THE FIVE SPOT? AND YOU TWO BUSTED MY BALLS 'CAUSE I NEVER HEARD JAZZ BEFORE. - YEAH. - I TELL YOU, THAT WAS THE MOS BEAUTIFUL FUCKING SOUND I EVER HEARD. IN FACT, THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST NIGHTS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE MISERABLE LIFE. I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH, HARRY. I'M NOT EVEN THAT SORRY TO SEE IT END. I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO TO HELL. - YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HELL. - YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS ME WHO FUCKED UP KAGAN SO BAD. - ALL FIVE OF US DID THAT. - BUT... I THINK I WAS THE ONE WHO DROPPED THAT GENERATOR ON HIS HAND. - ARE YOU SURE? WE WERE ALL SO FUCKING WASTED. OH, HARRY. JUST TELL HIM I'M SORRY.

THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE THAN THIS. - HE NEEDS TO REST. - YES, MA'AM. - HEY. YOU LOOK HUNGRY. SHE IS THE BEST COOK. - WE'LL BE BACK. - OKAY. - OKAY. - I'LL SEE YOU LATER, BUDDY. ONE NIGHT IN BARCELONA, TOMMY AND I WERE ON SHORE PATROLLING THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT. WE JUST MADE PETTY OFFICER, AND IT WAS OUR FIRST NIGH ON PATROL. AND IT WAS KIND OF QUIET, SO WE TIED UP AND WENT UP THE STAIRS TO ONE OF THE HOUSES. THE GIRLS FED US TOMATO AND CHEESE OMELETS-- TO THIS DAY, THE MOS DELICIOUS MEAL I'VE EVER HAD. AND THE GIRLS YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY NO A PROPER STORY AT THIS TIME ANYWAY. - DON'T WORRY, MR. SWEENEY. I'VE HEARD IT MORE THAN ONCE. THE DEPUTY OFFICER CAME IN, TWO OF THE GIRLS STOOD UP AND SALUTED WITH YOUR NIGHTSTICKS BETWEEN THEIR LEGS. TOMMY TALKED A LOT ABOUT YOU OVER THE YEARS. WHAT HAPPENED WITH KAGAN? - TOMMY NEVER TOLD YOU? - SOMETHING'S BEEN EATING A TOMMY EVER SINCE I'VE KNOWN HIM. AND THIS LAST YEAR, WHEN HE WAS SICK, ALL HE COULD TALK ABOU WAS THAT HE'S GOING TO HELL BECAUSE OF SOMETHING HE DID IN THE NAVY. AND ALL I KNOW IS THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED, AND THE TWO OF YOU DID SOMETHING TO THIS MAN, KAGAN. NOW, I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE THINKS HE'S GOING TO HELL FOR IT. - I DON'T THINK IT'D BE RIGHT, MA'AM. TOMMY WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU IF HE WANTED TO. - HELLO? MOM, IT'S THE HOSPITAL. UH, THIS IS HIS DAUGHTER. THANK YOU. - I, UH... I'M... I WISH I-- - OH, YOU... BOTH JUST... GO TO HELL. - MR. SWEENEY! I GOT THE NAMES OF MY DAD'S FRIENDS FROM THE SHIP, TRACKED THEM DOWN ON THE INTERNET. IT WASN'T THAT HARD, ACTUALLY. I'M SURE HE'D WANT YOU TO HAVE THEM. THEY'RE ALL ON THE EAST COAST. - HEY, I'LL TELL THEM ABOUT YOUR DAD. DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER WAS HAPPY? - AT TIMES, HE WAS HAPPY. - AT TIMES, YEAH. WELL, I BET YOU'RE A GOOD DAUGHTER. - I GOT TO GET BACK INSIDE TO MY MOM. - DAVID? DINNER IS READY. SO HARRY, ARE YOU A-- WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ARE, DAVID? - A YEOMAN. - AH. - HARRY'S AN ELECTRICIAN. - ELECTRICIAN'S A SENSIBLE CHOICE. IT'S A DAMN GOOD TRADE. YOU CAN NEVER GET ONE WHEN YOU NEED ONE. - DAVID TYPES. - DAVID IS A WONDERFUL JAZZ PIANIST. HE WAS THE STAR OF THE NEW YEAR'S PARTY ABOARD THE SHIP. EVEN THE CAPTAIN MADE A REQUEST. - I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND IT. IT WAS PERVERSE OF HIM NOT TO CONTINUE HIS CLASSICAL TRAINING. DID YOU KNOW THAT DAVID WAS A FEATURED SOLOIS WITH THE SANTA FE SYMPHONY WHEN HE WAS 13 YEARS OLD? smash! beep! - YEAH? HELLO? - RHEEMS. PETER RHEEMS. - YES. IT'S HARRY SWEENEY FROM THE NAVY. - JESUS H. CHRIST. SWEENEY! HOW THE HELL ARE YOU? IT'S BEEN A LONG FUCKING TIME. - DID I CALL TOO LATE? - OH! FUCK NO. HAPPY TO HEAR YOU'RE STILL ALIVE. WHAT'S UP? - I SAW KELLY. - KELLY, KELLY. AH, KELLY! RIGHT. TOMMY KELLY! - HE DIED THE OTHER DAY. - YEAH? WELL, THAT'S LIFE, ISN'T IT? HEY, LOOK. I BUILT THIS NEW HOUSE WITH A BEAUTIFUL FUCKING GUEST ROOM, A VIEW, PRIVATE BATH. ANYWAY, I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE YOU. - HOW FAR ARE YOU FROM PHILADELPHIA? - HEY, BUDDY. GOD, YOU LOOK GREAT. YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL. - YEAH, WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT. - YEAH, FUCK YOU TOO. - [laughs] - WHERE'S THE FUCKING TIME GO, HUH? - I DON'T KNOW. - JESUS. HEY, HONEY, HARRY SWEENEY'S HERE. COME ON OUT. MY GOD. YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK I'VE TOLD HER ANYTHING ABOUT OUR YEARS TOGETHER OUT THERE IN THE NAVY. - GOOD THING. - AND I DON'T THINK SHE GIVES A FUCK. - HI. - JUDY, HARRY SWEENEY. THIS IS MY WIFE, JUDY. - NICE TO MEET YOU, HARRY. - NICE TO MEET YOU. - DID YOU BRING YOUR WIFE? - UH, NO. I--I'M DIVORCED. - OH, I'M SORRY. HOW LONG? - UH, TEN YEARS, GIVE OR TAKE. - LOOK, GUYS, WHY DON'T WE DO SOME CATCHING UP INSIDE, NOT OUT HERE ON THE PORCH. FOLLOW ME. - YOU'RE OUR FIRST GUEST, HARRY. - YOU STOPPED ANSWERING MY CHRISTMAS CARDS. - YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE. - SO KELLY BOUGHT THE FARM, HUH? GEEZ. WHAT WAS HE DOING? - HE SOLD CARS. ALWAYS HAD THE GIFT OF GAB, KELLY. AND YOU? YOU STILL AN ELECTRICIAN? - STILL A SPARKY, YEAH. - STILL? - YEAH. YOU? - I WAS A SPARKY FOR A WHILE, BUT ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO, I WENT INTO REAL ESTATE. MADE A FUCKING FORTUNE. - GOOD. GOOD. GOOD. I GOT TO USE THE HEAD. - SURE. GO AHEAD. YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE TO USE THAT TOILE SINCE THE PLUMBER PEED IN IT. IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, YOU JUST HOLLER, ALL RIGHT? - OKAY, THANKS, PETE. snap! - HARRY. PETER WENT TO THE LIQUOR STORE. HE WANTED TO GE A NICE BOTTLE OF WINE FOR HIS GOOD OLD BUDDY. ARE YOU SEXUALLY ACTIVE, HARRY? IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION. - NO. - HOW LONG? A LONG TIME. - HARRY. - YOU DON'T BELONG IN HERE. - TOUCH ME. - PUT YOUR ROBE ON. - NO. NO. JUST PUT YOUR LITTLE ROBE ON. - HARRY, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? I NEED TO. TOUCH-- - SIT DOWN. - NO. PLEASE DON'T TELL PETER. - INITIAL REPORTS CLAIM ISRAELI JETS-- - I'M SORRY, MR. BARCLAY APPEARS TO SYMPATHIZE WITH ONE WHO-- - HEY, BUDDY. YOU WANT A DRINK? - WHATEVER YOU'RE HAVING. - SINGLE MALT SCOTCH, STRAIGHT. - FINE. IS THAT WHAT SUCCESSFUL REAL ESTATE TYCOONS DRINK? - ONLY THE BEST. BUSTING MY ASS FOR YEARS. I HAD TWO HEART ATTACKS. - SHIT. - HOW'S YOUR HEALTH? - A LITTLE ARTHRITIS. - OH, YOU FUCKER. - YOU EVER HEAR OF A RETROGRADE EJACULATION? WHEN I COME, IT SHOOTS BACK UP INTO MY BLADDER. A $40,000 VASECTOMY THERE. HEY. GOD. THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET IT UP IS WITH VIAGRA. - YOU'RE TELLING ME MORE THAN I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR PLUMBING. WE'RE GETTING OLDER. IT JUST HAPPENED SOONER THAN WE THOUGHT IT WOULD. - DO YOU REMEMBER... DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN... WE WERE AT THE ACROPOLIS IN ATHENS? - YEAH, OF COURSE I DO. - LAST YEAR, I WENT TO EUROPE, RIGHT? AND I GOT JUDY TO COME. IT WAS HER FIRST TRIP. AND WE WENT TO THE ACROPOLIS. AND I'M STANDING THERE IN THE EXACT SAME SPO THAT I WAS STANDING MY BRAIN'S FLIPPING. ME THEN, ME NOW. ME THEN, ME NOW. ME THEN, ME NOW. AND IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING AFTER THAT JUST DISAPPEARED. IT'S GONE. - I GET THAT KIND OF FEELING WHENEVER I THINK ABOU THAT NIGHT WE GOT KAGAN. THAT WAS LIKE THE ACROPOLIS. THAT WAS 1,000 YEARS AGO. - KELLY DIDN'T WANT TO DIE WITH IT ON HIS CONSCIENCE. IT'S A LITTLE LATE. HE WAS A LITTLE LATE, WASN'T HE? - KAGAN'S IN MIAMI. - ISN'T THA WHERE ALL THE QUEERS LIVE? - YOU REMEMBER WHO CRUSHED KAGAN'S HAND? IT WASN'T ME. - YOU SURE? WE WERE ALL PRETTY SHIT-FACED. I WAS... I WAS ON TOP OF HIM. AND... AND HE WAS SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER. THAT'S ALL I REMEMBER. - KELLY DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE. - I TELL YOU WHAT. I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU. I DON'T TALK ABOUT MY FUCKING PLUMBING, AND YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT FUCKING KAGAN. HOW'S THAT? ALL RIGHT? HUH? COME ON, PUT IT HERE. PUT IT HERE. HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT, MY MAN. - YOU CHICKEN SHIT.

HARRY WAS GONNA BE A PRIEST, YOU KNOW. - OH, MAN. - A CATHOLIC PRIEST? HOW INTERESTING. - YEAH, WE'D PULL INTO PORT, AND WE'D GO OUT WHORING ALL NIGHT. AND THE NEXT MORNING, HARRY WOULD BE RIGHT THERE GOING TO MASS. EVERY DAY. UNBELIEVABLE. - WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? - JUST LOST THE NEED TO. - JUST LIKE THAT? - NAH, IT WAS A LOT OF THINGS. - WELL, WHAT THING? OH, HARRY. OH, COME ON. - OKAY. OKAY. WE HAD THIS CATHOLIC CHAPLAIN ABOARD SHIP. AND I MADE AN APPOINTMEN TO SEE HIM, TALK TO HIM ABOUT THESE STRONG FEELINGS I'D BEEN HAVING. I KNOCKED ON THE DOOR TO HIS STATEROOM, HE JUST SAYS COME IN. SO I DID, AND THERE HE WAS, SITTING IN FRONT OF HIS MIRROR WITH HIS BACK TO ME, BRUSHING HIS HAIR. NEVER TURNED AROUND. JUST SAID, "YEAH?" AND I WAS A LITTLE PUT OFF BECAUSE HE CARED MORE ABOUT HIS HAIR THAN HE DID ABOUT ME. - I SAID, "FATHER, I'M THINKING ABOU BECOMING A PRIEST." AND HE TURNS AROUND TO ME, NO SMILE, NO WARMTH. I COULD SEE I IRRITATED HIM. HE LOOKS AT THE INSIGNIA ON MY ARM. "ELECTRICIAN'S MATE?" HE SAYS TO ME, LIKE I'M SOME KIND OF FUCKING TERMITE--EXCUSE ME. I SAID, "JESUS WAS A CARPENTER." AND HE GOES, "I GOT A MEETING WITH THE CAPTAIN." AND HE TAKES OFF. PTEW! - THAT'S A TERRIBLE STORY. - EH. - GOD, IT'S A FUCKING AWFUL STORY. - I GUESS THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF ME AND THE PRIESTHOOD. HE REALLY PISSED ME OFF. AND I...GUESS I LOST SOMETHING. BUT OF COURSE, YOUR HUSBAND WASN'T A BIT SYMPATHETIC. - NOT SYMPATHETIC. - OH, REALLY. - NOPE, NOT ME. YEAH. YOU KNOW, I THINK HARRY SWEENEY HERE WANTS ME TO GO WITH HIM TO SEE OUR GAY NAVY BUDDY. - I NEVER SAID THAT. - THAT'S THE ONLY REASON YOU CAME HERE, RIGHT? - KAGAN WAS YOUR FRIEND TOO, PAL. - BEFORE I...

AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME THAT I'LL BE SAD TOMORROW. - I'LL BE SAD TOO. - VISITING? - PASSING THROUGH. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - VISITING AN OLD FRIEND. - IT'S NICE TO STAY IN TOUCH. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN OVER 30 YEARS. - I'M 29. - CONGRATULATIONS. - HOW COME YOU'RE STILL THINKING ABOUT IT? ABOUT VISITING HIM? - I'M AFRAID I MIGHT BREAK HIS JAW. - 30 YEARS IS A LONG TIME TO HOLD A PUNCH. WHAT'D HE DO? - NOTHING. DID NOTHING. - I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. - WHERE DID YOU GET THE IDEA THAT I GIVE A SHI WHAT YOU THINK? SUCH A FUCKING COWARD. - I'M REPRESENTING REASON AS THE MOTOR ENERGY OF THE COSMOS IN POPULARIZING THAT TERM WHICH SUGGESTED PERSONALITY AND WILL. ANAXAGORAS GAVE AN IMPETUS TO IDEAS WHICH WERE THE BASICS OF ARISTOTELIAN PHILOSOPHY IN GREECE AND IN EUROPE AT LARGE. CAN I HELP YOU? - UH, PROFESSOR WILLIAM PORTER? - YES. - I'M HARRY SWEENEY. - WHO? - WE WERE IN THE NAVY TOGETHER. - UH, I'M AFRAID YOU HAVE THE WRONG MAN. - WE WERE ELECTRICIANS ON THE USS FORRESTAL. I HAVE NEVER SERVED IN THE NAVY NOR IN ANY BRANCH OF THE MILITARY. IN FACT, I DO NOT BELIEVE IN WAR. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE A CLASS TO TEACH. - DO YOU REMEMBER DAVID KAGAN? - WHOEVER YOU ARE, YOU BETTER LEAVE IMMEDIATELY OR I'M GONNA CALL SECURITY. - HE'S NOT TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. PROFESSOR PORTER ACTUALLY GLORIED IN THE IDEA OF WAR. HE BELIEVED THAT ANY MAN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE FOUGHT A WAR WAS MADE BETTER BY IT, MIGHT EVEN BECOME GREA BECAUSE OF IT. - ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN. NOW LEAVE. - SUPPOSE I TELL THEM WHAT WE DID TO DAVID KAGAN. HOW'D THAT BE, HUH? smack! - OH, MY GOD. - GET OUT. UGH. WHAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT? - 20 MINUTES. - WHY ARE YOU HERE? - TOMMY KELLY CALLED ME. REMEMBER HIM? HE WANTED TO BE FORGIVEN BY DAVID KAGAN BEFORE HE DIED, BUT HE DIDN'T MAKE IT. - WHAT HAS THIS GOT TO DO WITH ME? - I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHA YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THAT NIGHT. - I DON'T MAKE A HABI OF REVISITING THOSE YEARS. THE BOY I WAS THEN IS DEAD. - TELL ME WHAT YOU REMEMBER, AND I'LL DISAPPEAR. YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO HEAR FROM ME AGAIN. WE WERE IN DRY DOCK IN NORFOLK. YOU AND KELLY CAME INTO THE SHOP VERY ANGRY. YOU SAID KAGAN HAD MADE A PASS AT YOU IN THE SHOWER. HE TRIED TO GRAB YOU. KELLY SAID, "LET'S GET THE COCKSUCKER." AND WE DID. - WHO PICKED UP THE ARMATURE? - I ASSUMED IT WAS KELLY. - DID YOU SEE HIM? - NO. IT WAS CHAOS. WE WERE ALL ACTING LIKE SAVAGES. IT WAS THE MOS REPREHENSIBLE THING I'VE DONE IN MY WHOLE LIFE. BUT WHY DENY THOSE YEARS EVER HAPPENED? - TO THE GHOSTS OF OUR PAST. YOU KNOW, I DO HAVE A PLEASANT MEMORY OF THOSE DAYS. SITTING BELOW DECK LISTENING TO KAGAN'S RECORDS. THE HUM OF THOSE TRANSMITTERS MIXING WITH OSCAR P. FLYING ON THE 88s, AND CHET BAKER ON THE SNARE TRUMPET, MAN! WE WOULD BE DOWN THERE FOR HOURS. UNTIL THAT LIEUTENANT-- WHAT WAS HIS NAME? UH... CRANE CAUGHT US. MM. - SO YOU'RE KIND OF A BIG SHOT NOW, HUH? - OH, YEAH. BIG FROG IN A SMALL POND. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO? - I'VE BEEN VERY BUSY BEING A FAILURE. - A FAILURE. "FAILURE" IS A BIG WORD, HARRY. - I DON'T WANT TO FOOL MYSELF. - YOU KNOW, I DON'T BELIEVE IN WHAT MOST PEOPLE CALL GOD, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A PURPOSE TO ALL THIS. - YEAH. TO BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF US. YES. IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. WE'RE HERE TO LEARN. - WHAT ARE YOU HERE TO LEARN? - TO FORGIVE WILLIAM PORTER, U.S. NAVY, ELECTRICIAN'S MATE THIRD CLASS. - YOU CAN'T FORGIVE HIM? - I CAN'T FORGIVE... WHAT WE DID. YOU KNOW, HARRY, THE TRUTH WAS STARING AT US RIGHT IN THE FACE. WE JUST COULDN'T SEE IT, COULDN'T SMELL IT. YOU AND I, BEING FROM WHERE WE CAME FROM, BEING AGAINST VIETNAM, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN... UNTHINKABLE. AND IF WE HAD KNOWN BETTER, WOULD WE HAVE BEEN COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, HUH? AND YET, WE WERE SURE AS HELL BRAVE ENOUGH TO NEARLY KILL A FRIEND. - YOU MARRIED? - I HAVE A LOVELY WIFE AND A WONDERFUL SON. HE'S A LIEUTENAN IN THE U.S. ARMY FINISHING HIS THIRD TOUR OF DUTY IN IRAQ. - HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME. STUPID WAR. AND YET, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, HARRY, I AM VERY PROUD OF HIM. SO... YOU GOT PLANS? YOU WANT TO COME OVER TO THE HOUSE FOR DINNER TONIGHT? - THANKS, BUT, UH... NO, 20 MINUTES SEEMS TO BE ABOUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THESE LITTLE REUNIONS. - WHOA. - HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. - I'M GONNA PRAY FOR YOUR SON. - THANK YOU. YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, HARRY. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - AS YOU WERE, SAILOR. AM I TOO EARLY? - NO. PERFECT TIMING. I WAS HALF EXPECTING A CLERICAL COLLAR. - IT NEVER HAPPENED. - YOU'RE STILL WELCOME. COME ON IN. I WANT YOU TO MEET MY WIFE. SARAH? - GOOD MORNING. - MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE. - GOOD MORNING. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. - DIDN'T I SAY I WAS HOPING THE LORD WOULD GRACE US WITH SWEENEY'S PRESENCE? - YES, YOU DID. - WELL, I'M GLAD HE DIDN'T OBJECT. - HEY, DID YOU EVER TAKE UP GOLF? - EH, FOR A WHILE BACK WHEN-- - WELL, I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO INDULGE ME A LITTLE. - HELLO. - GOOD DAY, MARY. - PRAISE THE LORD. - PRAISE THE LORD. - SARAH. - WE'RE GONNA GO, DEAR. NO, SARAH INSISTED THA I GET OUT ON THE LINKS WITH YOU. I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A WHILE FOR ME. KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE, SO TO SPEAK. I DON'T MIND BEING THE SECOND BIRD. - THAT'S WHY WE SETTLED HERE 'CAUSE WE BOTH LOVED THE GAME SO MUCH. THEN SARAH GOT HIT BY A DRUNK DRIVER RIDING HER BICYCLE. - OH, MY-- - YEAH. IT BROUGHT US CLOSER TO THE LORD. - YOU WERE THINKING OF RE-UPPING LAST I SAW YOU. - WELL, I DID. MADE MASTER CHIEF. NO SHIT! - YEAH. - I NEVER TOOK YOU FOR A LIFER, GEB. - THERE YOU GO. - SHOW ME THE WAY, GEB. - OH, NO, GUEST HAS HONORS. - ALL RIGHT. THIS IS GONNA BE ABSURD. - NO, JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, LEFT ARM STRAIGHT, AND DON'T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING BUT HITTING THAT LITTLE BALL. - HOW MUCH TIME WE GOT? - MARY CAN STAY FOR THREE HOURS. - YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO TO YOUR HOUSE. - I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE ABOUT AS MUCH FUN OUT HERE AS WE'RE GONNA HAVE. clink! - YOU WANT TO PUT SOME MONEY ON THIS? - I DON'T BET ANYMORE. - TOMMY KELLY DIED THE OTHER DAY. - SHIT! - SORRY, GEB. I GOT A LO I GOT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. - CAN I TAKE MY MULLIGAN? - YOU USED TO BE A GOOD LISTENER. - YOU KNOW, I'LL LISTEN ALL YOU WANT... BUT IN THE CART. clink! OKAY. START TALKING. - YOU REMEMBER THE NIGH WE GANGED UP ON KAGAN? - I FIGURED THAT MIGHT BE ON YOUR MIND WHEN YOU CALLED. - WHY'D YOU FIGURE THAT? - 'CAUSE IT'S ON MY MIND A LOT. - I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED ONCE WE STARTED HITTING HIM. - IT'S PURE EVIL WHAT WE DID. JUST KEPT PUNCHING, KICKING. THEN KELLY PICKED UP THAT ARMATURE OFF THE WORK BENCH AND CRUSHED KAGAN'S RIGHT HAND TO A BLOODY PULP. AND THA TOOK THE FIGHT OUT OF US. - YOU SAW KELLY DO IT? - YOU THOUGHT IT WAS YOU? - I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. WE WERE ALL SO GODDAMN DRUNK. WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT I AFTERWARDS. RHEEMS SAYS HE DIDN'T DO IT. KELLY DIDN'T KNOW FOR SURE. - KELLY. KELLY ALWAYS HAD A MEAN STREAK IN HIM. HE HATED HOMOSEXUALS. YOU KNOW, I HATED YOU FOR YEARS FOR SICCING US ON HIM. WHAT WE DID WAS A TERRIBLE SIN, AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU. - BUT NOW THA THE LORD'S FAVORED YOU, YOU DON'T HATE ME ANYMORE, RIGHT? - I DON'T HATE ANYONE. PRAISE GOD.
