So, do allow the shimmering lights of summer to refresh and illuminate - your fertile young minds. - What's she talking about? The future greets you with its magic mirror, reflecting each golden moment, each emboldened choice. Dude, Miss Darbus has snapped her cap. Dude, you're actually listening? Yes, Jason. So, what was your favourite summer memory, Miss Darbus? Summers have passed fleetingly since I was your age, but I remember each with poignant clarity. Summer. Summer. Summer.

Yeah, my folks are gonna match whatever I make, but I gotta get hired first. Me, too. I'm saving up for a car, so I can take that little hottie on a proper date. Gabriella. I understand you've moved every summer for the past five years, and I'd hate to think today is goodbye. No worries. My mom promised I'm here until graduation next year. Bless Mom's little heart. Sharpay, we got off to a rough start, but you really came through. I mean, you helped me with the winter musical. I did? Those vocal exercises? See you. Gabriella and I have had, like, five job interviews, but we keep getting beat out by college kids. Yeah, same here. I guess I'm back in the babysitting business. Hey, Martha. Hey, Taylor. Hey, Kelsi, what are you planning to do this summer? Grow, write music. Grow. Your summer activities consultant has arrived. Hopefully some of those activities will include a job. Hey, whatever happens, as long as we're together, it's cool, right? You promise? Here's my promise. - "T" as in Troy? - Well, I... Yeah. Hey, man, how's it going? There you go, boss. Hoops. Let's go. Yeah, sure, sure. We're not busy or anything. Let's go. We could go to the movies, download music. Oh, I'm definitely teaching you a twisted-flip on the skateboard. Oh, and I have first-aid training, so I can patch myself up afterwards. All right! "Going to movies, listening to music. "And, golly, Troy, I have first-aid training. " Oh, please. Oh. Come here, Kelsi. I have a summer job for you. At our country club. Our rehearsal pianist is evidently moving. Or hiding. - Pardon? - Sounds great. Cheer up, Shar, it's summer. We can do whatever we want to. Everything changes. Ryan, who's the absolute primo boy at East High? I'd say Troy Bolton has that category pretty much locked up, don't you think? And East High's primo girl? - Just answer the question! - Gosh, you? Troy, Sharpay. Sharpay, Troy. Sharpay... Shar. - It just makes sense. - Evidently not to Troy. But it's summer, Ry. Everything changes. What time is it? Summertime Hey It's our vacation What time is it? Party time That's right Say it loud What time is it? The time of our lives Anticipation What time is it? Summertime School's out Scream and shout Nice workout, fellas. - I'm starving. - Me, too. I'll tell you what. I'm seeing moves I didn't see last season. - Keep it coming, guys! - Yeah. What team? Wildcats! All right! Yo, time for milk. - So, guys, how's the job hunt coming? - The big zero. - Girlfriend alert. - Talk to me. This is Thomas Fulton, General Manager of Lava Springs Country Club here in Albuquerque. I understand you've been looking for summer work. Hey, Troy, does Gabriella still remember your name, or did she find somebody new to karaoke with this summer? That sounds fantastic, Mr Fulton. But how did you get my name? Well, we've always had a student summer work programme here at Lava Springs. So, are you ready? Here's the thing. I know the most amazing girl... I mean, student. Straight A's, quintuple straight A's, and it would be so amazingly perfect if... Man, he's really working someone. It can't be Gabriella. Whenever she calls, he just blushes. Yeah, I never said that. Yes! - What's up, dog? - Nothing. Nothing. Nothing! Okay. I'll tell you what, you guys stick together this summer, you work on the game, and we are talking back-to-back - championships next fall. - Yeah! Can we all redirect this energy by carrying in the groceries? - Yes, Mrs Bolton. - Yes, Mrs Bolton. Hey, we're kicking off another hot summer here in Albuquerque. So, for those cool enough to have a convertible, crank up the sound, breathe that fresh air, and say hello to summer! Miss Evans, Mr Evans, looking very sharp this summer. Welcome back to Lava Springs. Thank you, Charles. Hi, boy! Oh, can you find some shade for my car? - Even if we have to plant a tree. - Fulton. And may I say, welcome back. It's good to be home. Are the flyers ready? This year we embossed the flyers for the show. Inspired. I plan to limit member talent auditions to 30 seconds each. Amateur performers are very... - Draining? - Yes. Understood. And should I... We be so fortunate as to win the Star Dazzle Award again. But where would we put it? We're planning on expanding the trophy case. The designs are in my office. - Fulton, you are so efficient. - Well... The staffing matter we discussed? Done. With discretion. Fabulous. - Oh, stop it. Yes. Yes. - Ryan! - Sharpay! - Girls. Your chaise in its usual spot, Miss Evans? Thank you, Javier. Emma, Jackie and Lea, east of me. Oh, and you'll be a prince to angle our chaises on the hour, as the sun moves. Well, thanks to the kind words from your mother last season, I've been promoted. But, no worries, I'll make sure that the new lifeguard is fully briefed on just how you like things. So, what's the theme of the summer talent show, Sharpay? - Redemption. - Love it. It was a very trying year, ladies. My drama department was invaded by outsiders, singers coming from the chemistry lab and locker room. Shocking, really. Sis, we've got the pool, the entire club, and the whole summer to enjoy it. And the spa has been redone. There's a guacamole facial and a seaweed body scrub on the menu. What could be more fabulous? - More ice. - Right away, Miss Evans. It's out with the old And in with the new Goodbye, clouds of grey Hello, skies of blue A dip in the pool A trip to the spa Endless days in my chaise The whole world according to moi Excuse me. Thank you. Iced tea imported from England Lifeguards imported from Spain Towels imported from Turkey And turkey imported from Maine We're gonna relax and renew You go do I want fabulous That is my simple request All things fabulous Bigger and better and best I need something inspiring to help me get along I need a little fabulous Is that so wrong?

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous Absolutely. Not. Yeah! I got you. I got you. It's okay. - What are you doing here? - I'm the new lifeguard. Wait, are you a member here? I told you to hire Troy Bolton, not the entire East High student body! You told me to hire Troy Bolton. "Whatever it takes. " Well, why didn't you warn me about the rest of them? I did discuss the matter with the Lava Springs board, of course. The board. You mean, our... Mother! Gabriella Montez and the Wildcats? Mother, how could you? Think of your future, kitten. These are your school chums, not the fuddy-duddy Lava Springs staff. These are not my chums! They'll steal my talent show. And what fresh talent you'll have for your summer show. Mother, did you hear what I just said? Ryan, talk to Mother. - Hi, Mom. - Ducky! How's my dashing boy? Tell pumpkin if she worries too much, she'll get frown lines. Namaste. - I want them out! - But your mother specifically said... Oh, don't mention that backstabbing yogini to me! If you can't fire them, make them wanna quit. I'm hoping Chef Michael's gonna teach me the art of Austrian flake pastry. And Sharpay's gonna be where I work every day. How much better can summer get? Right? Right? - A real dream come true. - If you actually get to know her, - I mean she's... - Dude. Hey, I didn't even know Sharpay's parents owned this place. Mr Fulton just said, you know, there's Wildcat fans at Lava Springs, and jobs are available. So, I said let's go for it. Inspiring, Mr Bolton. Truly inspiring. However, what we're looking for from all of you, is not inspiration, but perspiration. Confirming assignments. Bolton, Danforth, waiters. And, when needed, caddies. What? Miss McKessie, I'm told that you're efficient. - Well... - Prove it. You'll handle member activities. Keep me in sight at all times. Kelsi, piano. Lunchtime and cocktail hour. That means mood music, not new music. Capisce? Martha, chopping, cutting, preparing plates. Do complete the summer with the equal amount of digits I assume you currently possess. Oh, Zeke, you will assist Chef Michael in the... The promised land. You hold on to that. Mr Fulton, Your Excellency, sir, would it be okay if we draw straws to see who has to wait on Sharpay? Please, none of you will be waiting on Sharpay. Oh, yes. Snap. - You will be serving Miss Evans. - Who's that? Always address our members as Mr, Mrs, or Miss. Let's practise. - Do we have to? - Shall we? "Miss Evans, would you care for lemonade?" Actually, I'm not Miss Evans. I'm Jason. - It smells so good and I am so hungry. - No, wait. You don't... - No, no, no. - What's for lunch? Miss Montez. It would seem your lunch break does not start for 3.5 minutes. I do hope no members drowned in your absence. Henceforth, do clock in and out on time. Three infractions of any kind, and your employment is terminated. Capisce? Chop, chop, chop. - Okay, that man officially scares me. - Yeah. Suddenly, I'm beginning to miss detention with Miss Darbus. - How sick is that? - Come on. We got a hoop out back, two free meals a day, and we only have to wear these stupid outfits on duty. All for one, and one for all. All right? - This is our summer. Now, what team? - Wildcats! - What team? - Wildcats! Come on. How did we get from the top of the world to the bottom of the heap? I don't recall you mentioning the boss is such a creep We still have the ingredients to make this summer sweet Well, we got rags instead of riches And all these dirty dishes Just wish I had three wishes Okay, guys, break it up. We've got to work, work to work this out We'll make things right The sun will shine If we work, work, there'll be no doubt We can still save the summer if we work this out Dude, what have you gotten us into? Come on. We can totally turn this thing around! I'd rather face a seven footer straight up in the post Yeah That sure beats hanging here And burning someone's toast I needed Benjamins But this ain't worth the stress Maybe there's a better way to fix this greasy mess We're a champion team A well-oiled machine And we've faced tougher problems than this I know it's a grind But I'm sure we can find A way to have fun while we get this job done We've got to work, work to work this out We'll make things right The sun will shine We got to work, work There'll be no doubt If we all come together We can work this out Let's work it! Tell me what you want Tell me what you need A little bit of sugar A little bit of butter It's the perfect recipe Payday It'll taste so sweet Payday Good enough to eat Gonna make some motion pictures Hit the mall with all my sisters Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers Kick it with the music mixers Buy a ride that suits my style Lounge around the pool awhile Make a date with my favourite girl We've got it made Whoa, we've got to work, work to work this out We'll make things right The sun will shine If we work, work, there'll be no doubt We can still save the summer If we work this out Work this Got to work this We can work this out So, can we work this out? Yeah, we can work it out. Send the waiters right in. Miss me? Of course you did. Hey, you ever been on a golf course? We're employees, Troy. Not members. And I don't play golf. Who said anything about golf? Are you sure it's okay for us to be out here? Yeah, unless the jackrabbits turn us in. So, how's kitchen duty? Oh, you know, the team that washes dishes together, wins together. My mom said summer jobs look good on college applications. All part of the frightening concept called "our future. " Are you worried? Hey, college costs a fortune. My parents are saving pennies, unlike the people at this place. You're a cinch for a scholarship. I'm only as good as whatever happens next season. It's... I always liked the idea of being in charge of my future, until it actually started happening. So, let's just think about right now, because I've never been in one place for an entire summer, and this means a lot to me, especially being here with... Such an outstanding peanut-butter and-jelly-sandwich maker like me? I want to remember this summer, Troy. - Here, catch. - Oh, I love this game. - Ready? - Go. - Beautiful. - Very nice! Oh. Your turn. - You didn't catch a single one of them. - You... That was so bad. Fulton, when I was on the fourth fairway today, it seemed bone dry. Oh, no way! Could you tell maintenance to give it a little extra splash? No way! - May I have this dance? - Why, of course you may. Let's go then. You are gonna get so wet! Yeah! Keep an eye on them tomorrow and keep me posted. Why are you smiling? No worries, Ryan. This is our turf, remember? First a break-time infraction, now frolicking on the golf course. We are not off to an auspicious start, are we, Miss Montez? Actually, Mr Fulton, this was my idea, so she's... How gallant, but irrelevant. We won't allow this to happen again, will we? Good morning, everybody. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Smells good. That smells good. - Hey, Martha. - Hey. - Hey, Jason. - Hey, morning. - What's up? Yeah You are the music in me - Sounding good, Kels. - Thanks. Actually, I need to go get ready for the ladies' luncheon. Won't exactly be rocking out. You know, I am so excited about the club's talent show. I mean, the employees get to do a number, and I have ideas for everyone. You guys can sing the lead, and maybe Zeke and Chad can do backup, and everyone can dance. Big timeout on that one. My singing career began and ended with the East High Winter Musical. I'm just here to make a cheque and sneak in the pool after work. That's... That's really it. What was that you were playing a minute ago? Oh, it's... It's nothing. It's just nothing. What's this? Well, I was thinking if you'd do the show, that I wanted to be ready, and I wrote this for you guys. Come on. Go. Yeah You are the music in me You know the words "Once upon a time" Make you listen, there's a reason When you dream There's a chance you'll find A little laughter, or happy ever after You're harmony to the melody That's echoing inside my head A single voice above the noise And like a common thread You're pulling me When I hear my favourite song I know that we belong Oh, you are the music in me Yeah, it's living in all of us And it's brought us here because Because you are the music in me Yeah, yeah, yeah You are the music in me It's like I knew you before we met Can't explain it There's no name for it I sang you words I've never said - And it was easy - So easy Because you see the real me As I am, you understand And that's more than I've ever known, oh To hear your voice above the noise And know I'm not alone Oh, you're singing to me When I hear my favourite song I know that we belong You are the music in me It's living in all of us And it's brought us here because You are the music in me Together we're gonna sing We got the power to sing what we feel Connected and real Can't keep it all inside Oh, yeah Oh, yeah - Oh, yeah - Yeah, yeah, yeah You are the music in me Oh, yeah Oh, yeah You are the music in me When I hear my favourite song I know that we belong We belong You are the music in me It's living in all of us It's brought us here because You are the music in me Oh yeah Oh yeah You are the music in me Yeah - Oh, I love that song. - Great job, Kels. Oh, I've got the talent show sign-up sheet right here. Are you in? Maybe we can work this out, but only if we're all in this together. Yeah! This is going to be fantastic. I'm going to coordinate rehearsal to coincide with all of our schedules. Goldenthroat, this is Jazz Square. We may have trouble. Now, it's an amazing song, but Kelsi didn't write it for us. Hi, Mom. - Seaweed scrub, darling? - Maybe later. Ryan, it might be wonderful if Troy participates in our talent show. What? If he sings with Gabriella then our whole show is going to be the "Troy and Gabriella Show. " I'm not certain Gabriella is ideally suited to help Troy realise his full potential at Lava Springs. Mommy, what time is Daddy gonna be here? We tee off at noon. Join us? Love to. Up. And how shall we get to the food today, sir? - I don't know, perhaps skipping. - Very well then. Shall we? Hipty scouty, hipty skipty, hipty skipty, hipty skipty... Danforth, Bolton, you're caddying today. $40 a bag. You've been requested. - What? - By who? Dude, who cares? For $40, I'd caddy for Godzilla. Close, very close. Thank you. - Thanks. - Thanks, man. Hey, boys! So, Troy, I thought it was time for you to meet my parents. Enchantee. - Awesome. - Hi. Hello. So, where's your dad? Hi, Daddy! Where's the first tee and what's the course record? I'm just kidding. I built the course myself and I hold the record, but who's counting? Princess. - Son, you've been working out. - Yoga. Bring that around, there you go. Quite a season you boys had. Oh, Troy played for the golf team, too, Daddy. Oh, versatile. How about you, son? - Baseball. Track and field. - Outstanding. Might come in handy the way I play golf. Fair warning. Fore! - Brilliant, darling. Brilliant. - Lovely. Chad, you'll be caddying for Mother. Troy, Daddy. Daddy. Bravo! Brilliant. Let's take a walk. - Is that a new outfit? - Yes, just this morning. And yours? This old thing? I got it last week. Come on, Chad. What do you think? Well, it's 190 to the pin, downhill lie, elevated green. I'd go with a full five, sir. Hi. - Nice call. - All right. Princess, grab your pitching wedge. This one's yours. Thanks, Daddy. Line it up. That's my girl. That girl needs to take up knitting. Or some sport where she can only injure herself. - I'm in the sand. - Me, too. Knees, hips, shoulders, hat. Good. Drill it. Backboard. Yes! That's my boy. - Where... - I have no idea. Gabriella! Dinner tonight? Sneak a swim? Troy! - Oh, lovely, darling. - Nice. Daddy, why not let Troy try a shot? - Of course. Of course. - No, I shouldn't. - Come on. - Are you sure? - Yeah! - Yes, sir. - Are you sure it's okay, Mr Evans? - It sure is. - Give it a ride. - Thank you. - Here you go, Daddy. - Thank you, dear. - That's a beautiful swing. - Really beautiful. That is a beautiful swing. - That was awesome. - Thanks, man. - Come on! What do you say we... - What? I don't know. Off we go. I'm saving up for a car. I'm saving up for a car. Well, Tiger Woods would have been proud to make that putt! What a shame that Troy is only bussing dishes all summer, given that he's a potential star for your alma mater, Daddy. I've seen Troy play basketball. I think the U of A Redhawks will be very interested in him. That's inspired, Daddy. Troy is very concerned about college. - Really? - Yeah. - How's Coach Bolton these days? - Oh, fantastic. Outstanding. What? Oh, next time I see Country Club Princess, I'm gonna launch her and her pink cart straight into the lake. I'll build the ramp, buddy. Danforth, this is a kitchen, not a day spa. You and Jason suit up for dinner duty in the dining room. Bolton, you have five minutes to change and come with me. In case you're not familiar with this particular item, it goes around your neck, like a dog collar. Chop-chop. - And she stepped on the ball. - I did not. - Yes, you did. - I can believe that. Hey! Here's our superstar. Troy Bolton, this is Peter. - Peter. Good to meet you. - How are you? - This is Claire. - Hello. - And you know the family. - Hello. This kid's pretty handy on the fairways as well as the hard court. Bet you worked up yourself an appetite lugging those bags all over the place, huh? Yeah, yeah. A little bit. What do you say we get some food, and we can talk about your future. - My future? - Yeah, sit down. Have a seat. Daddy's on the board of directors at the University of Albuquerque. So, Troy, I saw your championship game. I mean, wow! That last-second shot at the buzzer... Outstanding. Actually, my teammates here stole the ball, otherwise I wouldn't have had a chance... Oh, you're much too modest, Troy. You were voted MVP for the entire season. This shirt positively screams for a Windsor knot. - Thank you. - Let me get that for you. You know, we've got a heck of a basketball programme over at U of A, and an excellent scholarship programme as well. Scholarship? Yeah. You know, between the two of us here, we... We pull a little weight over at the school. Well, time flies when you're having fun, but Mr Fulton will probably want me clocking out. Come on. Don't be silly. You haven't had any dessert, and we haven't talked about golf, yet. Oh, basketball and golf are just the beginning with Troy, Daddy. Have you heard him sing? Oh, triple threat. Oh, how wonderful. Troy can participate in the talent show. Oh, come on, Troy. Give them a sample. Kelsi! Kelsi. No, actually my voice is... Is feeling a little bit hoarse tonight, you know, all the talking. But thank you very much for the food and the golf and everything. It was amazing. But you will sing some other time, though? With me. Promise? - Promise. - Perfect. Dessert? Sorry I'm late! Give me two more minutes. Nice tie. Your shoes don't match though. Kidding. Honey, two minutes is being late, but an hour is approaching a felony. Just because Troy's a nice guy, doesn't mean he's immune to boy disease. Boy disease? Yeah, forgetting things he shouldn't forget. Oh, so now you're a boy expert? My older sister has 10 rules about boy behaviour, and nine of them involve boys forgetting things they should never forget, like dinner dates. Well, it wasn't an official date type of thing. Rule number three, all dates are official, whether the boy knows it or not. - You're not done. - But I'm done for the day, sir. And actually, I have a date. Mr Bolton, you're under the mistaken impression I'm interested in what you have to say. Just follow me. - But I... - No more speaking. - Hey, where are we going? - Please, Mr Bolton. - How long is this gonna take? - Watch your step. Insurance issues. I'm supposed to have a date tonight. But the evening is young and so are you. Well, where are we? Hold your applause until the very end. What the heck? Mr Fulton? A long time ago In a land far away Lived the pineapple princess, Tiki She was sweet as a peach In a pineapple way But so sad that she hardly speaky Still, if you listen well You'll hear her secret wish Aloha, everybody, my name is Tiki. I long to free A truly remarkable fish My sweet prince Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua 'a Makahiki malihini who Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua 'a Ooh Hawana waka, waka, waka Niki pu, pu, pu Ryan, the fog! She dreams of a boy Who is under a spell That has left him all wet and scaly I sing from my heart Of the power of love Just a girl with a ukulele - Come to me - Come to her - My sweet one, and be still - Be still I'll grasp your tail Then stroke each tender gill My sweet prince Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua 'a Makahiki malihini who Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua 'a Ooh Hawana waka, waka, waka Niki pu, pu, pu Now this is where we lead into the whole Kabuki thing. The clouds turned grey And the big sky cried And the ocean had a fit Ryan! Where's my ocean? Then the wind went whoosh And thunder cracked And mighty Mount Fufu spit Mighty Mount Fufu spit Tiki, Tiki Want to speaky, speaky, speaky With the mighty spirit Fufu Tiki, Tiki Want to speaky, speaky, speaky - The words I will not mince - Word! Please make a man Of my fresh fish prince This is real fish talk. No lie. And then the fish turns into a gorgeous prince and sings... I'm Prince Humu Humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a No. No way. Makahiki malihini who With me. Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a Hawana waka, waka, waka Niki pu, pu, pu Everybody! Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua'a Makahiki malihini who Humu, humu, nuku, nuku, a pua 'a Hawana waka, waka, waka Niki pu, pu, pu Waka, waka, waka Niki pu, pu, pu One minute. We'll talk about this later. So, you love it? Look, you ever tried just singing? I mean, without all the lights and sets and, like, backup people? Well, it'd be much harder to get applause that way. I'm not talking about applause. I'm talking about hanging out with friends. You know, doing nothing, and singing for fun. Wait a minute. Not doing anything. That might work. A dark stage, a single spotlight. We break out of darkness into the circle of light. - Wait, "we"? - No set, no frills. - Oh, man. - Simple. Dramatic. Just you and me. That is such a great idea, Troy. We could do it at our club talent show. Look, I'm here to work. Sharpay, I already told you being onstage really is your thing, it's not mine. It could be our thing. Time out on that one, okay? I've got an "our thing," it's with Gabriella, and... And I'm very late for her, so I got to go. - But the show could be so amazing... - I love your shoes. - You like them? - I really do. I bought them in New York. I have them in nine colours. Girls! Again from the top. Hey, lifeguard! You're crazy, Wildcat! And so late, but I brought food, a few little candles. I'm good for a poolside picnic. What do you say? Zeke even made desserts. But first, I dare you to jump in. You know we're not supposed to be in the pool. Club rules. Cramp! I need a lifeguard! Rescue me! Rescue me! Here I come! Thanks for coming in. Follow me. Oh, listen. You know, right now, with you, it's finally starting to feel like summer. Yeah, it is. The water bugs are back. Look, Mr Fulton, this was my idea, she had nothing to do with it. I generously overlooked your previous break violation, but then came the golf course jaunt, and now this. Two strikes. Don't get a third. Out of the pool. Sharpay's dad let me play a few holes and then invited me to dinner with some U of A alumni. Really? And they were talking about scholarships, while Jason and Chad were, like, serving me. And getting paid for it. It's called a job. You were invited, nothing wrong with that. Yeah. I don't know. It felt weird. I love that you've got the team working together, but you're not gonna be a Wildcat forever. The team is now, and that's... It's good, but everybody's got their own future. I'm not sure I know what you mean. Well, when you graduate, lots of people are gonna be chasing the same opportunities. There's nothing wrong with keeping your eye on the prize. In fact, if you don't, you get left behind. Yeah, I know, I'm just saying, I didn't get my friends jobs at the club so they could sit and watch me eat in the dining room. You know, I'm just saying never be ashamed of attention, as long as you've earned it. You know, a scholarship's special, that's why there's only a few to go around. Yeah, yeah. I get it, Dad. Okay. So, how was the food at Lava Springs? Insanely good. - Take it out for a spin. - No way. Well, you didn't think I was going to drive this heap, did you? Yes! Yes! Okay, bring those knees up as high as you can and circle those arms. Hey, water bug. Last night was so fun. I really didn't mean to get you in trouble. Same here. - So, maybe today we can have our... - Troy? What time is your lunch break? Troy! -1:30. -1:30, great. Free cheeseburgers are on me. Everybody looks great. Awesome job. Okay, now, some jumping jacks. Hey. What is she up to? - Who knows? - Believe me, she does. I'm sorry I'm late, Mr Fulton, but about the pool thing last night, you can't blame Gabriella... - I'm promoting you. - You're what? There's an opening as an assistant to the golf pros. Salaried job, no clocking in. - But, I... - $500 a week, plus tips. What? Per week? Oh, my... That's off the hook! I think it sounds very manageable. Shall we? Bolton! - Wait. So you want me to teach golf? - To kids. Oh, the joy. - But, sir, I don't think I'm qualified. - Worry not. Simply show the little angels which end of the club to hold, tee the ball up, then duck. In addition, the board is extending membership privileges to you. You have complete use of club facilities, but do so prudently, meaning, fellow Wildcats? Not. Congratulations. You'll find an appropriate choice of clothing here. Do not mix checks with plaids, blue with browns, and avoid wearing white socks at all cost. Leave your shoes outside the locker, they will be buffed and polished each evening. Yes! Oh, man! Save it for the first tee. And to get there, this might come in handy. That's the key to your golf cart. Number 14. The same number that's on your basketball uniform, so I'm told. Questions? How did this happen? It would seem that the Evans family thinks you have untapped potential. Young man, the future is full of uncharted waters, and this family has real clout, so I suggest you take the ride. Yeah. Italian. Awesome, junior golfers! You guys look amazing! Hey! Hey! Slow down, champ. Slow down. Save some for the other kids. There you go. Cool shorts, buddy. All right. Hey. Hey, cutie. Try holding the club that way, you're going to hit it way farther. All right. Nice backswing, man. Nice backswing. Good job, killer. Make the ball fear you. You look good. Great job, everybody. Good job, guys! - Bolton. Bolton. Your 11:30 is here. - Thanks, man. Good luck, buddy. Troy! Oh, man. - Cool balls. - Thanks. You're welcome. By the end of summer, you'll have me playing like a pro. Yeah. If I live that long. I'm so excited about the show. Oh, and don't worry. We'll find something great to do. Look, Sharpay, I already told you, singing really isn't my thing. And here's the best news, all the Redhawk boosters will be there. - Really? - Of course. We'll lock up your scholarship with a high "C" right from centre stage. We're all in this together, right? Your parents have been really, really nice, Sharpay, but singing with you isn't a part of my job. I know, just something you promised to do. Remember? You look fabulous in your new clothes, by the way. - You like the shoes? They're Italian. - Nice. Let me show you how this is done. It's really easy. Just line up to your target. Nice, easy backswing. - Hey, Gab. - Hey! That girl's got more moves than an octopus in a wrestling match. - Nah. He knows how to swim. - Yeah. Troy can handle himself. I did overhear him asking her for her opinion on his new Italian golf shoes. He didn't ask me. So, wake up, sister! She's basically offering him a college education just to sing with her in the talent show. - Troy would never do that. - You got eyes, use them. - Let's go eat. - Yeah, I got to go. Hey, see you later? - Okay. - Okay. You're going to take it back and through. - Troy, Fulton wants you in the lobby. - Fantastic. Thank you. See you. And she steps on the ball. - Troy Bolton. This is... - I've seen them all play at U of A. Oh, all right. Well, come scrimmage at our gym. It'll be good for your game. - Play with you guys? - Yeah. Let's get down, bro. - Awesome. - All right. - Let's all get some awesome lunch. - Yeah. I knew it! Coral blue! It's perfect for your skin tone. And mine, too! We are majorly skin-tone compatible, Troy. - I have no idea what that means. - You don't need to. I'm here for you. - Who's hungry? - Let's eat. I mean, how can you hit the ball straight if your clubs don't trust you? - That's the key. So, it's all in the grip. - Okay. You got to hold it just right. That looks great. Hey, I almost forgot. I ordered Swiss on my burger. So, go ahead and check it out, man. Try it. See what you think. Danforth, table three needs more iced tea. Now, rotate your hands over the top. - Put your thumb on that side. - Okay. There you go, man. You're good. I'll see you on the course. - Yeah. Let's do it, man. - Yeah. - Zeke! Troy wants Swiss. - Coming right up. You know, you were right. There's a guy out there that looks just like Troy Bolton, but I have no idea who he really is. Oh, hey. Kelsi's got some great new ideas - to spice up the talent show. It's got... - I'm thrilled. That new duet that Troy and Gabriella sang? I need it. - Actually, it's not available. - Repeat. Well, it's something I wrote for Troy and Gabriella, just in case they decide to... You're an employee, not a fairy godmother. Let's have it. Transpose it into my key. Troy and I will be doing it in the talent show. Oh, and brighten up the tempo. We'll need to keep people awake. What about our song? - What about Humu Humu? - Change in plans. What am I supposed to do with my Tiki Warrior outfit? Save it for Halloween, go to a luau, sell it online. I don't know! But in the meantime, keep an eye on those Wildcats. If they're planning on being in the show, which I doubt, once they hear about Troy and me, I don't want any surprises. Oh, and don't worry, I'll find a song for you somewhere in the show. - Or the next show. - Really? Don't strain yourself, slick. Entertainers are so temperamental. Transpose! Look at you. - Go, team. - Yeah. It's a gift from the guys. The "guys"? Oh, you mean all those tall people? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, look. I got to go in a minute, but I'll be back in about an hour. I'll pick you up in my new truck and we'll go to a movie. I promise. "Promise" is a really big word, Troy. Yeah. I know. And we've got the staff baseball game after work. Remember, you "promised" that you'd play? Right. Right. Baseball. I will absolutely meet you there. - You forgot, didn't you? - No. I just got the date mixed up. And I'm sorry I couldn't make lunch today. I just... It's been wild, you know? I can't believe how things are working out here. So I see. Italian golf shoes, new clothes, golf carts. That's crazy stuff. Hard to keep track of it all, I bet. So, what's your point? It just doesn't seem like new stuff, it seems like a new Troy. All right, let's see if Tiger Woods still has a jump shot. - Hey, hey, Bolton! Come on! - Hey! Why don't you tell them to come over here and mix it up? We'll show them some game. You know, I don't think that's how they roll. That's not how they "roll"? No, no, no, that's not what I meant. I just think it's a closed practice. Sorry. Wow. Well, maybe you can get us a video? Bolton, come on! But yesterday you said we were going to play two-on-two after work, - before the baseball game. - I know. I know, man. I'm sorry. Come on, Zeke, that was so yesterday. You know, when we were all on a team! - Hey, man. - Hey, how's it going? Hey, Bolton! That's my ball. - Here we go! - How's it going, guys? Would you guys be mad at me if I ask him to get me one of those cool Redhawk jackets? Hey. Come on. I'm so excited about the game. It's going to be so cool. Hey, Ryan. No rehearsals? My sister is working up something new. So, you coming to the baseball game? I'm not staff. Wasn't invited. Hey, everyone's invited. Come on. Hop in. All right. Hold on! All right! Right here! Beep, beep! Beep, beep! What, did Fulton send you out here to spy on us? Nah, my sister did. She thinks you guys are going to upstage her talent show. Oh, no worries. We were going to do the show, but then Troy bailed on us, so, whatever. What do you mean "whatever"? It's our summer, remember? I thought we decided doing the show would be fun. - Well, I think so. - Me, too. - Who are we kidding? - I don't think so. We don't know how to put together a show. No, but he does. If we have a real director putting it together, it could be great. Have the employees ever won a Star Dazzle Award? - Hey, now... - I know what you can do, Ryan, - so why not do it for us? - All right, look, if you want to play ball, then grab a mitt, but I don't dance. You don't think dancing takes some game? - You got game? - A little. Yes! Hey, pitcher. Ball. All right! Let's hustle! Come on! Wildcats! Get your head in the game! Hey! Oh! Play ball Hey, hey! Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter Swing I've got to just do my thing Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter Swing Yeah I'll show you that it's one and the same Baseball, dancing, same game It's easy Step up to the plate, start swinging I want to play ball now and that's all This is what I do It ain't no dance that you can show me Hey, hey, hey - Yeah - You'll never know - Oh, I know - If you never try There's just one little thing that stops me every time - Yeah - Come on! - I don't dance - I know you can - Not a chance - No - If I can do this, well, you can do that - But I don't dance - Hit it out of the park - I don't dance - I say you can - There's not a chance - Oh - Slide home, you score Swinging on the dance floor I don't dance, no Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter Swing I've got to just do my thing Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter Swing Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Two stepping, now you're up to bat Bases loaded, do your dance It's easy, take your best shot Just hit it I've got what it takes playing my game So, you better spin that pitch you're gonna throw me - Yeah - I'll show you how I swing - You'll never know - Oh, I know If you never try There's just one little thing - That stops me every time - Yeah, come on - I don't dance - I know you can - Not a chance - No, no If I can do this Well, you can do that - But I don't dance - Hit it out of the park - I don't dance - I say you can There's not a chance Oh no Slide home, you score Swingin' on the dance floor I don't dance no Lean back, tuck it in, take a chance Swing it out, spin around do the dance I wanna play ball not dance hall I'm makin' a triple not a curtain call I can prove it to you till you know it's true 'Cause I can swing it I can bring it to the diamond too You're talkin' a lot Show me what you got Stop Swing Hey Swing it like this Yeah oh - Swing - Come on - Jitterbug - Just like that oh That's what I mean That's how you swing You make a good pitch but I don't believe - I say you can - I know I can't I don't dance You can do it I don't dance, no Nothin' to it Atta boy, Atta boy, yeah Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter What One, two, three, four Everybody, swing, come on - I don't dance - I know you can Not a chance No, no If I can do this Well, you can do that But I don't dance Hit it out of the park - I don't dance - I say you can There's not a chance No, no If I can do this Well, you can do that But I don't dance Hit it out of the park - I don't dance - I know you can Not a chance No, no If I can do this Well, you can do that But I don't dance Hit it out of the park - I don't dance - I say you can - There's not a chance - Oh Slide home, you score Swinging on the dance floor I don't dance, no Safe!

Oh, dang! This kid's good. I like what I'm seeing. Troy gives 110, 24/7, that you can count on. Here we go! - Game. Game. - Good game! Was I right? Great. All right, so you call that a "little" game? Little League. World Series. Newport, Rhode Island. Champions. - Good job! - Nice hat. - You're so awesome. - Hey. What can I say? - Troy, you ready to run it back? - Let's run it, man. - All right. Let's go, yo. - Let's go. Let's go, yo, let's go. Let's run it back. - Looking good. - Wow, Wildcat! - Too much? - Only in daylight. - Yeah. - East High colours, very impressive. - Hey. Be true to your school, right? - Absolutely. Everyone's excited about doing the show. Hey, I know everyone thinks that I'm Sharpay's poodle, - but I really think that I could... - Hey. If they were thinking that, they're not thinking that today. How do you do that swing-step you did last night? That's easy. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. So, I called last night. I got hung up at the gym. Hey, my dad says you're doing great with those college guys. Oh. Yeah. They're awesome. Playing with them is like being in another world. Well, you missed out on a fun night. It was a great game. But the dessert afterwards had to be the best part. Her mom makes the best brownies - in the entire world. - Yeah, I know. I've had them. Well, I'll see you guys later. Hey, LeBron, how'd it go with the Redhawks? You know, they're very tall. We got Vince from maintenance to play, so it worked out. - In case you were wondering. - Maybe we could play later today. I don't know. Check with Vince. Well, Mr Evans set up the workout, not me. Did you even ask to include us, Captain? I didn't go looking for the Redhawks, the Redhawks came to me. Okay? I didn't sign up for this golf job, Fulton offered it. I said yes. My decision. But I show up to work same as you, so chill, man. You get a speck of dirt on your pants, - and someone dry cleans you. - And you wouldn't do the same thing... - If I was as good as you? - I did not say that. - You didn't have to! - And neither did you! You know what? We didn't vote you captain because of your jump shot. Okay, we did it because you're the guy who usually knows what's up. - But I guess things change. - You think you got me all figured out? Well, I don't think so. And I don't answer to you. Then maybe you should start answering to yourself! Look, we have been like brothers since pre-school. If I don't know who you are these days, then who does? Excuse me. You're all being paid to work, not play Dr Phil. Chop-chop. Table settings, nice. Oh. No, no. No. No. No. Now, that? Fabulous. Troy! Daddy will make certain the entire scholarship committee is right here. Perfect view. I've already spoken to your mother. They're going to be sitting at a table right next to ours. It's going to be a fabulous evening. - Come on. - Great. Rehearsal, everyone! - Taylor, I'm signing off on everything. - Fabulous! - Thank you, Mrs Evans. - Good job. Look, Sharpay. I know I promised I'd do this, but just take it easy on me. I'm kind of new to the whole performing thing. Five, six, seven, eight! You are the music in You are the music in Are the music in You know the words "Once upon a time" Makes you listen, there's a reason And when you dream there's a chance you'll find A little laughter, or happy ever after You're harmony to the melody That's echoing inside my head A single voice Above the noise Like a common thread Sing it to me When I hear my favourite song I know we belong 'Cause you are the music in me It's living in all of us It's here Because you are the music in me You are the music in You are the music in Are the music in Harmony to the melody Echoing inside my head When I hear my favourite song I know we belong 'Cause you are the music in me It's living in all of us It's here Because you are the music in Me, me, me, me, me You are the music in You are the music in me Yeah, yeah Oh, yeah Great job! One second. Great rehearsal! Everybody break! You know, Troy, I've always known you were special. And it's pretty obvious I'm special, too. I think we were meant to sing together, don't you? I need some air. Don't be long! We're going to run it again! Show me what you got! Come on, everybody! Here we go! You're up! You're up! You're up first! Here we go! Give it to me! Come on! Oh, yeah! You got it! Here we go! Pass it to me! Come on, let's dance! You're up! You're up! Let's show them what we got! Come on! All right! Oh, cut that! Get out of here! - You got it! Hey. - Good job! - Thank you. - You're welcome. I said keep an eye on them, not turn them into the cast of Grease! Pretty cool, huh? Do you want us to lose the Star Dazzle Award to a bunch of dishwashers? Us? Well, I guess that's showbiz. When did you become one of them? You know, I'll take that as a compliment. But you and Troy have a good show, sis. Oh, we plan to. Give me a beat. The Midsummer's Night Talent Show means something to me, - and to my family. - Well... Those Wildcats will turn it into a farce. I'm... Your brother is one of "those Wildcats," I'm told. Oh, don't you mention that traitor to us. Employee involvement in the show is a tradition here. Traditions change. My parents have important guests coming. We'll need every employee working the party, and not on stage. Pardon moi, but we're not just talking about employees, we're talking about your classmates. You might want to think this one out. All right. Done. Now do it. - Hi, Taylor. - Hi. Distribute these in the staff area, but not until the end of shift. - What? Wait! Mr Fulton... - No discussion, Miss McKessie. This is a business. Welcome to the world of adults who wish to keep their jobs because they have mortgages they wish to pay, tuition bills, car payments, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, sometimes, we have to perform tasks, however unpleasant, that are necessary for that all-too-important paycheque to land in our all-too-empty pockets! - May I get you a cup of tea, Mr Fulton? - Chamomile would be lovely. - Go, Martha! Go, Martha! - Go, Martha! Go, Martha! May I have your attention, please? You guys, I need to make an announcement. All junior staffers will be required to work on show night. - What? - Yeah, it says, "No staff participation in the show will be allowed. No exceptions. " - No show? - There's a show. We're just not in it. That's great. I'm sorry, you guys. There's nothing we can do about it. It's Fulton's orders. There's no way this is Fulton's idea. Unless Fulton suddenly has blonde hair and wears designer flip-flops. Excuse me. - Totally! - Sharpay! Forget about the rest of us, how about the fact that your brother has worked extremely hard on this show? Oh, boo-hoo. He'll be in the show. He'll do his celebrity impersonations. And don't lecture me about Ryan, given the way you've been interfering with Troy's future. What? You've gotten him written up by Fulton for sneaking on the golf course, swimming after hours. I had to step in just to save Troy's job. I'm not interested in what you think you're doing for Troy. That's between you and him. But you're messing with my friends, my summer, and that's not okay with me. You don't like the fact that I won. What's the prize? Troy? The Star Dazzle Award? You have to go through all of this just to get either one? No, thanks, Sharpay. You're very good at a game that I don't want to play, so I'm done here. But you better step away from the mirror long enough to check the damage that will always be right behind you. Girls! Hey. What do you mean you're done here? I mean, you can't quit. Us working together sounded good, but plans change and people change. The club talent show is a big deal for Sharpay, and evidently for your future, so it's cool. Just make it happen. - Wear your new Italian shoes. - Hey, I'm still me. Blowing off your friends, missing dates? - If that's you, it's good to know. - No, no, no, no, no. I was only doing that because I'm working on the scholarship thing. You know that. But if along the way you act like someone you're not, pretty soon that's who you become. I meant what I said about movies and summer and just being together. I'm sure you did, at the time. But I also meant what I said, that I want to remember this summer. But not like this, Troy. I gotta say what's on my mind Something about us doesn't seem right these days Life keeps getting in the way Whenever we try Somehow the plan is always rearranged It's so hard to say But I gotta do what's best for me You'll be okay I've got to move on and be who I am I just don't belong here I hope you understand We might find a place in this world someday But at least for now I gotta go my own way Don't wanna leave it all behind But I get my hopes up And I watch them fall every time Another colour turns to grey And it's just too hard to watch it all Slowly fade away I'm leaving today 'Cause I gotta do what's best for me You'll be okay I've got to move on and be who I am I just don't belong here I hope you understand We might find our place in this world someday But at least for now I gotta go my own way What about us? What about everything we've been through? What about trust? You know I never wanted to hurt you What about me? What am I supposed to do? - I gotta leave, but I'll miss you - I'll miss you Oh, so I've got to move on and be who I am Why do you have to go? I just don't belong here I hope you understand I'm trying to understand We might find a place in this world someday - But at least for now - I want you to stay I gotta go my own way I've got to move on and be who I am What about us? I just don't belong here I hope you understand I'm trying to understand We might find our place in this world someday But at least for now I gotta go my own way I gotta go my own way I gotta go my own way You're usually taking these right off the grill. Maybe I've been eating too much at the club. You've barely been out of this room the last three or four days. - Let's call the guys, get a game going. - They wouldn't come even if I called. I find that hard to believe. Dad, do I seem different to you this summer? You dress a lot better, that's for sure. Oh, man, I'm serious. Maybe my friends are right, maybe I'm turning into a jerk with new shoes. New shoes, not a new kid. Where's this coming from? I've been so focused on my future. I mean, Gabriella quit. Chad won't talk to me. I don't see the Wildcats running around here. Is this about going after what you want? Yeah, Dad. The scholarship's important. I get it. Hey, hey. Look, it's only a big deal if it makes sense to you. I don't even know who I am any more. You know what? I've known this kid for a long, long time. And I got a lot of faith in him. He looks a lot like you. I'm absolutely sure he's going to figure out the right thing to do. It's so good. I cannot wait. Yeah, I'm eating so much breakfast, I won't be able to eat my dinner at night. Oh, yeah. It's okay, Ryan's gonna help. - I don't know. - We'll get it eventually. Excuse me. Everybody's always talking at me Everybody's trying to get in my head I wanna listen to my own heart talking I need to count on myself instead - Did you ever - Lose yourself to get what you want? - Did you ever - Get on a ride then wanna get off? Did you ever Push away the ones you should've held close? Did you ever let go? Did you ever not know? I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am I'll give it all I got, that is my plan Will I find what I lost? You know you can Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it Bet on me I wanna make it right, that is the way To turn my life around Today is the day Am I the type of guy who means what I say? Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it How will I know if there's a path worth taking? Should I question every move I make? With all I've lost, my heart is breaking I don't want to make the same mistakes Did you ever Doubt your dream will ever come true? Did you ever Blame the world but never blame you? - I will never - Try to live a lie again I don't wanna win this game if I can't play it my way I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am I'll give it all I got, that is my plan Will I find what I lost? You know you can Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it I wanna make it right, that is the way To turn my life around Today is the day Am I the type of guy who means what I say? Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it Oh, hold up Gimme room to think Bring it on down Gotta work on my swing Gotta do my own thing Hold up It's no good at all to see yourself And not recognise your face Out on my own It's such a scary place The answers are all inside of me All I got to do is believe I'm not gonna stop, not gonna stop till I get my shot That's who I am, that is my plan We'll end up on top You can bet on it, bet on it bet on it, bet on You can bet on it, bet on it, bet on it Bet on me I wanna make it right, that is the way To turn my life around Today is the day Am I the type of guy who means what I say? Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it You can bet on me This way. What do you mean you're not doing the show? - Exactly that. - We're singing a duet, Troy! A duet means two people. Well, mostly me in this case, but whatever! Duet! I'm an employee. Employees aren't allowed in the show. No, no, no, no. No, no. You're an honorary member. Not any more. - I asked Fulton for my kitchen job back. - What? Sharpay, I don't like the way you've been treating my friends. And I don't like the way I've been treating them either, so I'm doing something about it. An entire table of University boosters are coming to see you, thanks to me. So, I'll be their waiter. They'll be thrilled. Troy, Troy. This could change your life! I'm more interested in about what my friends think of me, and what I think of myself. Oh, we could all hold hands around the campfire some other time! Right now we've got a show to do. No. You've got a show to do. I got a kitchen to clean. It's okay. Kelsi, find Ryan. Welcome this evening. You'll be seated at table 21. Kelly, will you escort them, please? Excellent. Ladies, you look gorgeous - this evening. Beautiful. - And now, returning with a abridged version of last year's tap-dancing epic, Tina and her Tippety-Tappity Toes! There you are! Thank goodness you've come to your senses. Plug in the volcano. Humu Humu is back on. Enjoy your pineapple on your own, sis. I'm not doing the show. What? Oh, put some fresh batteries in your Tiki Warrior costume - and let's get going! - Took your advice. Sold it online. You've always wanted the spotlight. Now you've got it. Break a leg. The curtain's up. Showtime! Kelsi told us what went down between you and Sharpay. I'm more interested in what went down between me and you, man. - I was a jerk. - Yeah. But, hey, brothers fight. And they're still brothers. All right! Guys, I messed up your show and I'm sorry. Yeah, because show business is our entire lives, right? Hey, I hope you haven't permanently filled my spot in the two-on-two game. And, Ryan, I know how hard you must've worked on this show. Making these Wildcats look good couldn't have been easy. - Hey. - So, I apologise. Hey, the truth is, we've all had a lot of fun. At least, I have. Hey, you gotta see this dude play baseball. I'm looking forward to it. - All right! - Yeah! Troy, listen, all these people out there, I don't really want to see my sister crash and burn. At least, I think I don't. I think you should sing with her. My life is over. I've been a good girl. I've never lied, except when necessary. I always bought my parents expensive gifts, using their credit card, of course. But I don't deserve this humiliation! You need to get out there. Mrs Hoffenfeffer and her sock puppet are stinking up the premises. Well, the only thing that would make it any lovelier would be that if I won that Star Dazzle Award! Sharpay, I'm going to find you. That award, I tell you, it's mine! Mine! Mine! Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the... Oh, forget it. How's your show going? How's it going? My show makes the captain of the Titanic look like he won the lottery. - I'll sing with you, Sharpay. - What? I promised. And I keep my promises. But what was the first thing you said to me when I started working here? - Bring me more iced tea? - Think harder. We're... - All in this together. - Exactly. Well, we are.
