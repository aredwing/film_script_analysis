My pen creates stories of a world that might have been- a world of my imagining. And here is one I'm going to tell. But take care... not to smile at any part of it. It begins with a stranger. - Mr. Heathcliff? - Mr. Heathcliff? - You'll have to wait. - You'll have to wait. Who are you? Lockwood. Your new tenant up at the Grange. I'm surprised you'd choose a storm to go wandering about in, Mr. Lockwood. Well, I, um... I lost my way out on the moor. Is the Grange far? Perhaps I could get a guide from amongst your lads. You could not. I'll go with him as far as the park. You'll go with him to hell. Mr. Heathcliff, if I'm not to have a guide to take me up to the Grange, I shall have to sleep here tonight. I don't keep accommodation for strangers. Or I'll sleep in the chair. There's a room they don't use. Don't leave it by the window. Why not? "Catherine Heathcliff. " "Catherine Linton. " "Catherine Earnshaw. " Let me in. Who the deviI put you in there? The deviI is right. She's... Her face. She looked like... You should not have gone in there. Lockwood has stumbled into the end of a strange story... a story that began 30 years before when an old man returned to Wuthering Heights... weary after a long journey. He's coming! Joseph. All right, don't rush me. Father! Ah, home again, Cathy. What have you brought me, Father? Cathy, give Father a chance to draw breath. Just wait and see. Wait and see. Oh, my Lord. I found him... starving in the streets of LiverpooI. He's a filthy gypsy, Father. He's a gift from God. You're to treat him as your new brother. But where's my present? Hasn't he got any family of his own? He's part of our family now. That's your brother- Hindley, and this... is your new sister- Cathy. Offer your hand as I showed you. Earnshaw named him Heathcliff. Cathy was drawn to the silent, self-possessed boy. But it was hardness, not gentleness that kept him silent. Nothing here belongs to you- not now, not ever. From the very first, Heathcliff was more Cathy's brother than Hindley. Like all wild things, she shared with him a love of the open moor. The rock and the lowering skies. Oh, mercifuI God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ... Though Heathcliff became Mr. Earnshaw's favorite child, his protection was limited by the length of the old man's life. ...shall not die eternally. You have also taught us by His holy apostle St. PauI... Grant this, we beseech Thee, O mercifuI Father, through Jesus Christ, Amen. Your quarters are in the stables from now on. Heathcliff! Morning, Cathy. Morning. "Then Rab-shakeh stood "and cried with a loud voice "in the Jews' language, 'Hear ye the words of the great king. "'Hearken not to Hezekiah, "'for thus bade the king of Assyria "'make an agreement with me by a present. "'And come out to me and eat thee every one of his vine "'and every one of his fig tree "'and drink ye everyone the waters of his own cistern... "' 'untiI I come and take you away to a land like your own land," "'a land of corn and wine, Hindley, don't... a land of bread and vineyards. "' Stop it... "'Beware, lest Hezekiah persuade you. "' What, done already? When Father was alive, we could play on Sunday. Why not let them be, Hindley? You put these two down to their scriptures. And be sure to examine them on it this time. Heather... AnimaI. Pepper. Pepper? Pepper. Feels like tree bark. Silver birch. Silver birch? Mm. But it's warmer. My turn. Shame on you. Think of your souls! Master Hindley! Master Hindley! What are you thinking about? I was thinking about the sea. You ever seen the sea? No, I was too little. I don't remember. My life didn't begin untiI I... untiI I... Who sent you? Nobody. Was it a bird? Bird. Or a tree? No, a bird. Or the wind. No, a bird. I don't know. Do you know anything? Can you talk to trees? No. Talk to the wind? Mm-mm. Let's send your spirit into that tree. Where? There. There? Make it talk to us. Talk to me. Listen. Oh, listen. They're calling your name. How did you do that? I can do lots of things. What things? Stand up. Where are you going? Come here. Come back here. Come here. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. If, when you open your eyes, the day is sunny and bright, so shall your future be. But if the day is full of storms, so shall be your life. Now, open your eyes. What have you done? I don't care. Do you hear me? I don't care. Where are you going? To have a look. Come on! Sheltered in a valley, carpeted in crimson, the Grange, home of Edgar Linton and Isabella, his sister. Doesn't it make you wish you'd been adopted by the Lintons? I wouldn't give up what I have for a thousand lives like the Lintons. Come on. Come on! Come on! This way! Come! Come! Go on! Run! Oh, no, you don't! Make room. Ooh, my goodness. It's Catherine Earnshaw, Father. - Uh, Fitz. - Yes, sir. You had better send for Dr. Kenneth. Bring her through. Leave her be! Leave her! Come back here! I think he must be Earnshaw's gypsy. Throw him out. Catherine! Cathy! Look at the state of her. Poor girI. I will speak to Hindley Earnshaw about this. She's his own sister. Perhaps she should stay here for awhile. Thank you. How is she? Better, I think. I reckon the Lintons will be sorry to lose her. When's she coming home? Did she ask about me? Remember that Mr. Hindley's forbidden you to speak to Miss Cathy when she returns. So she... she had no message for me? No doubt we'll all find her very changed. Thank you. How are you? Much better. Thank you. Thank you, Hindley. Joseph! Nelly. Welcome home, Miss Cathy. Oh, Nelly, what do you think of her? She's quite the lady now. Where's Heathcliff? Heathcliff, you may come forward. Wish Miss Catherine welcome like the rest of the servants. Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me? Shake hands. That is permitted. I shall not stay to be laughed at. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to laugh. Look at you. You needn't have touched me. A little more? Yes, I'll have some. Thank you... Get that gypsy out of here! You're not... Stop it! fit... for a civilized house! The worst thing about you is that you never see anyone else's obligations. Oh, my God. They looked after me for three months. I found a lapwing's nest at Peniston Crag when you were away. I waited every day for a sight of you... coming over the moors. But you didn't come. So I put a wire mesh over the nest, and all the little ones died when they hatched. Why? Because the parent birds couldn't get near enough to feed them. No. Why did you starve them? Well, there wasn't any point in keeping them alive to show you. If you'd have come back, I'd have spared them. In the future, you must spare them. Don't you trust me? Don't you know I'll always come back? Don't you know that? Heathcliff. Always. In giving birth, Frances- Hindley Earnshaw's wife- died. And Hindley, whose sorrow was of the kind that could not weep or pray without her life, lost all interest in his own. Name this child. Hareton Earnshaw. Hareton Earnshaw... I baptize thee in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. We receive this child into the congregation of Christ's flock, and assign him to the sign of the cross, in token that, hereafter, he shall not be ashamed to confess the faith of Christ crucified, but manfully to fight under His banner against sin, the world and the deviI. Oh. What have you got that silly frock on for? We're still in mourning, Miss Cathy. Shouldn't you be back in the fields now, Heathcliff? No. Ah! Found it. Edgar and Isabella Linton said they might come this afternoon. Cathy? The crosses are for the days you've spent with the Lintons. The dots are for the days you've spent with me. You see? I've marked every day. Hmm. Very foolish. As if I took notice. Where's the sense in that? To show that I do take notice. Oh, I see. Should I always be sitting with you? You might be dumb for anything you say to amuse me. You never told me before that I talk too little. Or that you disliked my company, Cathy. That's no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing. It's so lovely to see you. Come in. Nelly. Oh, Cathy. I thought you were Frances, risen from the dead. Nelly, will you keep a secret for me? Oh, is it worth keeping? Today, Edgar Linton asked me... to marry him. Oh... Well... How should I answer? Well, really, Miss Cathy, how should I know? I accepted him. Cathy... Do you love Mr. Edgar? Um, of course I do. Of course. I can't help it. Why do you love him, Cathy? Uh, because he's handsome and pleasant to be with. Bad. Because, um... he's young and cheerfuI. Bad, still. And because he'll be rich. And I shall be the greatest woman of the neighborhood. Cathy. Is that what you really want? Well, marry Mr. Edgar then. Where's your obstacle? Here. In my souI and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong. And if my brother had not put Heathcliff so low, I shouldn't have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now. So he... he'll never know I love him. My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries. And I watched... and felt each... from the beginning. My love for Linton is like... like foliage in the woods. Time will change it... as winter changes the trees. I love Heathcliff. He's the... He's like the... eternaI rocks beneath. A... A source of literaI, visible delight... but necessary. Nelly... I am Heathcliff. Shh. Why? It's Joseph, and Heathcliff might be with him. In fact, I'm not sure he wasn't here earlier. Young deviI of a gypsy gets worse and worse. He's left the gate open and took off across the moors. No. Go and look for him. Call him back. What? Now, go after him. Do you think he heard? I think he heard something. What? What did I say? I think he heard up untiI the bit where you said it would degrade you to marry him. Oh... Heathcliff! Cathy! Heathcliff. Please, come in, Miss Cathy. Oh, my God, I lost him. - Cathy! - I lost him! Heathcliff... Heathcliff! I cannot live without my life. I cannot live without my souI. The Heathcliff of her childhood disappeared forever that night. She could not find him. As she recovered, she waited for his return... but he did not come. And eventually, Cathy turned away from her old life at Wuthering Heights. In marrying Edgar, she found a measure of happiness. Two souls as different as the moonbeam from lightning... or frost from fire. But thoughts are tyrants that return again and again to torment us. Joseph! Confound you, man. A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you, ma'am. What does he want? I didn't question him. I'll be back in a moment. It's not one of Hindley's creditors, is it? No, sir. It's someone the mistress doesn't expect. Heathcliff's come back. Well, don't strangle me for that. I know you didn't like him, but, for my sake, you must be friends now. Shall I tell him to come up? Come on. You bid him step up. Catherine, try to be glad without being absurd in front of the whole household. Heathcliff is a runaway servant. Sit down, sir. Mrs. Linton has asked me to welcome you. And, of course, I'm delighted when anything occurs to please her. And I, also. Especially if it's anything of which I have a part. Where have you been these two years, Heathcliff? You seem to have done very well. Yes. Perhaps you came into your inheritance? Yes. You look very fit. Perhaps you've been soldiering and seen some service abroad. Yes. I shall... I shall think it a dream tomorrow. And yet, you don't deserve this welcome. To be absent and silent for two years. I heard of your marriage, Cathy, not long ago. I traveled here simply to have one glimpse of your face. I fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice. And you must forgive my silence, for I struggled only for you. Where are you staying? At Wuthering Heights. Hindley Earnshaw invited you to stay at Wuthering Heights? It is I who invited him to stay. It appears that Hindley mortgaged the property to cover his gambling debts. I was able to assist my old friend by taking up his notes. I am the owner of Wuthering Heights now. What do you mean? Hindley and Hareton are both dispossessed. It's our old home, after all. Where Cathy and I grew up. I have a particular attachment to it. Everything's so awake now. Do you remember how we pictured heaven? I remember how you pictured it. Mm, how did you picture it? With you. Whenever and wherever you spent time with me. Go away. I love you. When you went away, I removed myself from the Heights. I rooted myself in his life, in the Grange. I cannot uproot myself again. Why not? I cannot. Let me kiss you good-bye. You won't drive me away again, Cathy. I don't want to. But let us kiss good-bye as Cathy and Heathcliff from long ago. And kiss good-bye to that time. All right... we put that time to sleep. When we meet tomorrow, we will be as we are now. And I shall kiss you again. You must never kiss me again. I love Edgar and he's dependent on me. If you kiss me again I would have to leave him, and I would not survive. The surest way to kill me is for you to kiss me again. You sent me away because you knew I wanted to be with him. I'll not believe this idiocy. You think you're in love with Heathcliff? I love him more than you ever loved Edgar. And he'd love me, too, if you'd let him. I wouldn't for you for a kingdom then. He's an unreclaimed creature. He's a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man. It's not true! Heathcliff has an honorable souI. You think I speak from wicked selfishness? I'm certain you do. Good. Try for yourself. I'm done. Heathcliff. We've been quarreling like cats about you. Catherine, don't. Let me go. My poor sister-in-law is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physicaI and moraI beauty. And she's sulked since yesterday's walk when I sent her out of your company. Well, she wished to be out of my company now, at any rate. There's a tigress. Mm. She's her brother's heir, isn't she? I believe Cathy has been painting a black picture of me. You mustn't imagine for a moment that she lies. I'm a villain. I'm only after your fortune. Devious. Who? Your worthless friend. What are you doing? What's it to you? I'm not your husband. You've treated me infernally. Infernally... And if you imagine I'll suffer unrevenged, you're a fooI. I've treated you infernally? At least allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style. Have you been listening, Edgar? You, sir, leave my house immediately. If you delay, I will put you out. Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull. Ellen, fetch the men. "Fair" means you haven't the courage to attack him. Apologize, or allow yourself to be beaten. Cathy, give me the key. I said give me the key. I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy. A compliment to you on your taste. I've seen her like this before, sir. She's making herself ill just to spite us. It could be dangerous with the baby due. Please, sir, couldn't you go and talk to her? Yes. You're right, Ellen. It was you that brought her back before, sir, when Heathcliff ran. I don't ever want to hear that man's name mentioned in this house. Good night, Ellen. Heathcliff. Heathcliff. Cathy? Nelly. Nelly? Nelly... I'm afraid of being alone. No, you're not alone. Nelly's here now. Shh. Cathy? Cathy? Let me feeI the wind. It come... it comes straight down off the moor. No, Cathy. No... I wish I were a girI again. Laughing at injuries, not maddening under them. Why am I so changed? Look. It's my room. The candle in the window. You can't see the house from here, Cathy. Joseph's waiting till I come home. He'll wait awhile yet. It's a rough journey and a sad heart to traveI it. And we must pass through Gimmerton Church to go that journey. We've braved its ghosts often together. We've dared each other to stand among the graves and call on them to come. Heathcliff, if I dare now, will you venture? He's considering. He'd rather I came to him. You are slow. You'll always follow me. Heathcliff... Cathy? Push! Push! Good girI. Come on, come on. That's it. Come on. Push down. Harder. Looks good. Harder, harder. Come on, Cathy. Good. That's a good girI. Good girI. Mrs. Dean wishes to see you. How's Cathy? Mrs. Linton has had a little girI. So... the Linton estate... belongs to my wife. You seem to forget my brother is still alive. I've not forgotten for an instant. This young lady is looking sadly the worse for a change in circumstance. Somebody's love falls far short in her case, obviously. Her own. She hates herself. As you see, she degenerates into a mere slut. It was a marvelous effort on her part to discover that I did not love her. But at last, I think she begins to know me. Tell your Master Nelly that I never in all my life met with such an abject thing as she. She even disgraces the name of Linton. Take care, Ellen. He wishes to provoke Edgar to desperation. I'll die first. The single pleasure I can imagine is to die... or see him dead. There. That will do for the moment. What will they name her? Cathy's daughter? Catherine. Catherine Linton. Hareton? I remember when this house was full of the sound of laughter, Mr. Hindley. Now there's nothing but bitterness and hatred. Stay where you are. You're not going yet. Sit down! Ellen... I must see her. Try and understand. Cathy's very ill. Another encounter between you and Mr. Edgar would probably kill her. I must see her, Nelly. Cathy. How can I bear it? You and Edgar have broken my heart. And now... you come to me as if you were the one to be pitied. I shall not pity you. - You've killed me. - No... Will you forget me? Will you be happy when I'm in the earth? Are you possessed with the deviI to talk in that manner to me when you're dying? Can't you see that all those words will be branded in my memory and eating deeper eternally while you are at peace? I shall not be at peace. I don't mean to torture you. Please, Heathcliff... do come to me. Please. Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy? You loved me... and what right had you to leave me? The poor fancy you felt for Linton? Nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us. You, of your own will, did it. I've not broken your heart, Cathy. You have broken it, and in breaking it, you've broken mine. If I've done wrong, I'm dying for it. You left me, too... but I forgive you. Forgive me. It's hard. It's so hard... to forgive. I look... at those eyes... Yes... I forgive what you've done to me. I love my murderer, but yours- How can I? How can I? She's dead. I've not waited for you to learn that. Put your handkerchief away. Don't sniveI before me. Damn you all. She wants none of your tears. She lies at peace now, Heathcliff. May she wake as kindly in the next world. May she wake in torment. I pray one prayer. I repeat it till my tongue stiffens. Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living. Heathcliff, don't! You said I killed you. Haunt me, then. I know that ghosts have wandered the earth. Be with me always, take any form, drive me mad... only do not leave me in this abyss where I cannot find you. Oh... God... I cannot live without my life. I cannot live without my souI. ...to raise us from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness, that when we shall depart this life, we may rest in Him, as our hope is this, our brother doth, and that, at the generaI resurrection in the last day, he may be found acceptable in Thy sight, and receive that blessing, as Thy well-beloved son... Before the spring was out, Cathy's brother Hindley followed her to the grave. He drank himself into oblivion, leaving Hareton, his son and heir, to try to wake some love in Heathcliff's embittered heart. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Now, my bonnie lad, you're mine. Let's see if one tree won't grow as crooked as another with the same wind to twist it. So Heathcliff claimed the last surviving Earnshaw. As the father had used him, so he would use the son. I was looking for birds' nests. 18 years have passed. Catherine Linton, Cathy and Edgar's daughter, grown up within the confines of the Grange, sheltered by her father... Catherine! and never knew the nearness of the wild inhabitants of the Heights... untiI today. Now... who is this? - Can you tell? - Your son? Yes, but don't you recognize your cousin... Linton? Linton. I thought you lived in London. Father sent for me when Mother died. Well, have you nothing to show your cousin? Take her outside. I do not think my father likes you, Uncle. I imagine he thought me unworthy to marry his sister. What does that inscription mean? Some damnable writing. I can't read it. I can read it. I want to know why it's there. Can you believe in the existence of such a colossaI dunce? Can't even read his own name. Is that your name- Hareton Earnshaw? My mother's name was Earnshaw. Didn't you know? Hareton is also your cousin. How do you do? Father. Guess who I saw today on my walk in the moors? Ellen has already told me, Catherine. Why do you forbid me to visit Wuthering Heights? Is it... is it because you dislike Mr. Heathcliff? No... not because I dislike Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr. Heathcliff dislikes me. He was quite pleasant, Father. Sit down. I have no male heir, Catherine. I'm certain that Heathcliff seeks by some means to dispossess you of your inheritance... and in that way, to revenge himself on me. He's a diabolicaI man, Catherine. He will stop at nothing to bring down those he hates. She might have been living yet... had it not been for him. Dearest Catherine... why have you not come back to me? Every day... I wait for you. My one waking thought has been of you. Perhaps Uncle Edgar has forbidden you to visit Wuthering Heights. You must find a way of seeing me again. My life didn't begin untiI I saw your face. Why have you not... come back to me... Catherine? I have waited so long. Now... sign it... "Linton. " Are you sick? No, I'm feeling better. I'm just tired. Oh. Well, cousin, I'm here at your command. Uh, you look well, Miss Linton. Miss Linton? Miss Linton. My father is gravely ill after fighting to come here because you begged me to. What is it you want of me? My house isn't stricken with the plague. Sit down and have some tea. Miss, um, Linton... I... I give you what I have. The present is hardly worth accepting, but I have nothing else to offer. It is my son. Linton. What are you saying? Father wants us to be married. He knows Uncle Edgar won't allow it while he lives, but he's afraid of my dying if we wait. So we are to be married tonight and then Father will be master of the Grange. I'm not afraid of you. Give me that key. Help me! No one knows you're here, Catherine. I swear, you will not leave this house untiI I am your father. The only father you'll have in a day or two. Oh, you're not afraid of me, hmm? Your courage is well disguised. I am afraid now, because if I stay, my father will be miserable. Let me go home. His happiest days were over when your days began. He cursed you, as I did, for coming into this world. Weep away. It'll be your chief diversion hereafter. Mr. Heathcliff, you're a crueI man, but you're not a fiend. If my father died before I returned, could I bear to live? I'm going to kneeI here, at your feet, and I'll not get up till you look back at me. Don't turn away. Look. Have you never loved anybody in all your life, Uncle- Never? Keep your fingers off. Move or I'll kick you. How the deviI can you dream of fawning on me? I detest you. Ellen! Uh-uh-uh, "I require "and charge you both, "as you will answer at the dreadfuI day of judgment, "when the secrets of all hearts should be disclosed, "that if either of you know any impediment "why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony "ye do now confess it. "For be ye well assured, "that so many as are coupled together "otherwise than God's Word doth allow, "are not joined together by God. Neither is their matrimony lawfuI." I've been waiting for you to come. Is it true you've married? I have. You happy? Yes. Your fortune belongs to Heathcliff now. Tell me you're safe. That Linton will protect you. He will protect me. So be it. I'm going to her now. Father... No. What was she like? What was who like? My mother. She was a wild, wicked slip of a girI. She burned too bright for this world. Am I like her? I see her mostly in Hareton. I've come to fetch you home to Wuthering Heights. I've found a new tenant for this house, and I want my children about me. Go make yourself ready. I haven't been in this room since the night I returned. I've made the sexton remove the earth from her coffin. Aren't you ashamed to disturb the dead? I disturb nobody. I gave myself some ease... when I saw her face again. It is her as yet. Your son is dead. How do you feeI? How do you feeI, Catherine? I feeI and see only death. Come to the fire- you must be frozen. Get away from me. How dare you touch me... when I would've given my life for one kind word when I was imprisoned. You kept off. Do you think I'm going to accept friendship from you now? I've only come into this room 'cause I'm cold. What is it? My son's will. He left the Grange and all your personaI property to me. Look where he signed it... "Linton. " It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now. There we are. There we are. Shh... Shh. He's just like a cart horse, isn't he. He does his work, gets his food, and sleeps. Do you ever dream, Hareton? I find out that I'm glad... that I should like you to be my cousin. Hareton. Hareton? Do you hear? Go to the deviI and let me be. No, I won't. You must listen to me. I'll go to hell body and souI before I look sideways at you again. You should be friends with your cousin. Friend? When she hates me? Thinks me not fit to wipe her shoes. It's not I who hates you; it's you who hates me. You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does. And more. You're a damn liar! Why have I made him angry then by taking your part a hundred times? I didn't know you took my part. Mrs. Dean? Mm-hmm? Please convey this gift to Mr. Hareton Earnshaw, and tell him, if he'll take it, I'll come and teach him to read it. And if he refuses, I'll go upstairs and never tease him again. So, you forgive me? You'll be ashamed of me every day of your life, and the more... the more you know me. So you won't be my friend? Mr. Heathcliff... I want to make a small garden. They'll be no gardens here. You shouldn't grouch a few yards of earth when you've taken all my land. Your land, you insolent slut?! - You never had any! - And my money. That's enough. And Hareton's land, - and his money. - You must not speak to him so. If you strike me, Hareton will defend me, so you may as well sit down. You dare to try and rouse him against me! You... you must learn to avoid putting me in a passion... or I shall really murder you sometime. Come back and finish your dinner. Go home. You've other company. I don't know how you can bear to leave her. How can you defend him? He's robbed you of Wuthering Heights. Your name's above the door. Doesn't matter. If he were the deviI himself, it wouldn't matter. How would you feeI if I spoke badly of your father? Heathcliff's not your father. He's my true father. It's a poor conclusion, is it not? My old enemies have not beaten me. Now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their children. I could do it. No one could hinder me. But where's the use? Eat it while it's hot. Oh, for God's sake, please don't keep staring like that. Turn round. Tell me, are we by ourselves? Heathcliff... you've not had a Bible in your hand since you were a lad. Let me fetch the parson. There's a strange... change approaching. How do you mean- a change? It's been a long fight. I wish it were over. Cathy? Eh... Mr. Heathcliff? You'll have to wait. Who are you? I- I'm Lockwood. Your new tenant up at the Grange. I'm surprised you'd choose a storm to go wandering about in, Mr. Lockwood. Who the deviI put you in there? The deviI is right. She said she'd been walking the earth for 20 years. Catherine Linton, or Earnshaw, or whatever she's called. Her face. She looked like... Oh, you should not have gone in there. Will you come with me? No. To you, I've made myself worse than the deviI. Together, they are afraid of nothing. They would brave Satan and all his legions. And the price? Three graves by a low wall where the churchyard meets the open moor. A generation lost and gone. Edgar, Cathy, Heathcliff. May they sleep sound in that quiet earth. But country folk will swear on their Bibles that he still walks.
