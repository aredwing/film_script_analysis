I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - You're okay? - Yes. It's moving up. It's going to...turn into something inside. Like an alien. I'm sure it'll find its way. - You know why? - Why? It's easier from down here than it is from your trachea. Do you feel anything? I can't even imagine. Do you feel anything? I'd like it to have your mouth. Just like that. I'd like it to get your tits. My tits? Not if it's a boy, that'd be a problem. That sounds weird. They're going to be so pretty. They'll both be girls? All six will be girls. They'll be pretty. And they'll talk with your super sexy British accent. It's not sexy at all. What do you mean? I love it when you say, "Fuck me". I'm not saying that to you. It's swearing. - It's what? - Swearing Whatever, you're really sexy when you do "swearing". Fuck me. What? Fuck me. Fuck me? Please! Fuck me. Oh yes. Fuck...you. Fuck...you. They're going to be so pretty. And really smart. And annoying. And the bathroom will always be occupied. And all the boys will be after them. I'm going to hate that. One of my aunts is really ugly. Well, I hope they don't date assholes. I'll be the typical badass father... - that scares his daughters' boyfriends. - You? Scary? You'll take them out for gin and tonics. I know you. Sure, you know me. Like I gave birth to you myself, Sergi. Wouldn't that be kind of weird? It's impossible. What's impossible? Looking into both eyes at once. You have to look at one or the other. Now all you see is my nose. Actually you can from a distance. Only if you don't think about it. You can forget about Lucia. Either Marina or nothing. Not Marina. Alba. Neither of those. It sounds like something from the sea... It sounds normal to you, but it's weird... "Alba" of what? Alba like "dawn"? And Marina... Marina sounds like "marine". No showering for four hours. Squid! It's Sunday! Christ. Alex. Alex. The coffee. You. What? The coffee. What's wrong? Alex. I got an email. Something bad? I don't know. No, not bad. What? From your mother? From an alien? Something about photography? Kind of. - What, a scholarship? - A residency. A residency? Shit, that's good, isn't it? Isn't it? It's in Los Angeles. In the United States. Damn. So, for how long? A year. And...when does it start? In January. January to December. So what is it for? To do a project. Wow. Do they pay for everything? Everything. Room, board. It's fucking great, right? Fucking great. Fucking great. - Right? - Right. How come you didn't say anything about this? I just read it. What do you mean you just read it? Yeah, I got an email. Out of the blue? - Kind of. - What does that mean? Marta submitted me. - Which Marta? - The curator. So, it's from earlier. Well, she'd mentioned it to me to see if I was interested, but... And you said yes? Of course. So, you knew. No. Well, yes, but it was a long shot. How long have you known? She mentioned it months ago. Do you want toast? Mm-hm. Don't you want to talk about it? Talk about what? We can think it over together. I'd like to know what you're thinking. So if you're already pregnant, what? I wouldn't go. You'd send me pictures of the kid? I didn't say I was going, only that I wanted to talk. Yeah, but you want to go, don't you? If not, you wouldn't have mentioned it. Do you want to go or don't you? Answer the question, Alex. I'd like to work doing what I like. You can't do that here? - In my free time. - So? We won't have free time with a child. Ah, that's the problem. No, it's reality. The same reality as ten minutes ago when I was cumming inside you. You can be so unpleasant sometimes. Just say you don't want it. Of course I do. They're two different things. And I haven't said yes. I just got the notification. I just wanted to talk. Sounds like you've been thinking about it for a while. Sergi, you have to understand me. Shouldn't I think about it? It's a mess here. When was the last time I presented anything? Everyone has gone abroad to make a living. Biel in Denmark, Johnny in Argentina. Everyone has had to leave. Yeah, but they weren't expecting a child. A lot of couples go together. Look at Oscar and Cristina in Berlin. I don't want to give English classes forever. Yeah, well, I didn't ask you to work. Fine. What about me? My teaching boards? I've always supported you. Or do I ditch the kids at midterm? So what? What are you asking of me, Alex? Permission to go away for a year? Is that what you want? Is that what you want? Where are you going? Out for fresh air. What about breakfast? Maybe we rushed into the baby thing and we're not ready. I don't know. We'll think it over later, okay? Sergi, I just wanted to think. If we could make it work, I don't know... It's just a year. It sucks for me too, but it's like... the last train. So take the train, Alex. What can I say? I'm not going anywhere. Okay? I'm not going. Here. Vitamin C. Sorry. Sorry about before. Stop it. No...no You should go. Yeah, you should go and... No. I don't feel like it anymore. And get back to doing exhibits and your photographs and all that. - Yeah. You should go and... - I am not going. We've been together for seven without having a kid. One more year doesn't matter. And I'd like to come see you in Los Angeles after I take the boards. And we can go on a road trip. And fuck like crazy in roadside motels with cockroaches. Grimy ones. And I'll impregnate you in Los Angeles. I don't want an American child. Alex, come on, add it up. Nine months. You'll be back here by then. It'll be born here. No! And I'll learn English. It's how I'll learn English. What? I'll learn English. Yes or no? I'll learn English. I believe it when I see it. I don't understand nothing. But listen to me. Listen. You...You're really good. And I'm positive you'll come back with a fucking amazing project under your arm. And then everyone here will be fighting over you. Hey. We're strong. Really? Or I could play some salsa. Fuck. Definetely not that. Come here. Day 2 This is Sunset Boulevard. Very nice. Palm trees and everything. Nice. There is where my neighbor lives. What's he like? Fine, I don't know. I think he's an art fag like me. - This is my place... - Meaning, you don't know him, do you? - No. - Okay. - And look. - Wow. This. Wait, wait, wait. Look here. Here's my cactus. Yeah. Holy shit. What a cactus. And my number. - 523 and a half? - Yes. My bathroom. My kitchen. A unique and incomparable couch from Ikea. Right. A unique and incomparable coffee table from Ikea... And this is my studio. Look, a unique and incomparable lamp from Ikea, too. That, too. Everything. Very nice. It's all really fucking white, isn't it? Yeah, I'm afraid to drink coffee here. This is my bed. What a piece of shit... Don't Americans have everything king sized? We'll have to squeeze when you come visit. Even better, let the neighbor suffer when he sleeps over. Shut up! - What I'm really crazy about. - What? The sexiest part. What? What is that? Carpeting? Yeah! So you left London to get away from carpeting and now you've got to suck it up. You look beautiful. That shirt looks good on you. It smells...ugh. It smells like you. The apartment stinks like you, too. It's a good thing! It's a nice apartment. What were you expecting? An apartment with a hot tub? Yeah. Really? And gnomes in the yard. Have you turned into an eccentric old rich lady? Yes. Minigolf. Tigers. Day 5 Day 16 I'm gonna let you go. I've got to get up at eight. How do you manage to wake up without me kicking you out of bed? Like everyone, with alarm clocks. Alright... ...good night. Well, good morning for you. Sleep well. Day 33 Stop it! Quit it with the socks. That's enough. What? I like to find the match. It's just a fucking sock, not a work of art. What an obsession with socks! Hey! You want it? Wait... Grab some black panties. Black? I don't know if I have any. - The ones you're wearing. - No, these are gray. Toss it! Day 40 Look. This is my neighborhood. - Tons of yards. - This is paradise. Not many people. A lot of light. You don't run into anyone when you take a picture. Empty landscapes. I'm gonna show you the lake. Silver Lake. There are no people here! I want to see stars. Aren't there any stars? See that gas station? Yes. This is the Stephen Shore picture I showed you. That's right, it is. I wanted to take a picture to recreate it, but it's impossible. The place has changed too much. Look. This is Hollywood Boulevard. Okay, show me Hollywood Boulevard. Look. Look at this. Look at this woman. Holy shit! The incredible faceless woman. Scary. - What is that? - They do it everywhere. Even in Barcelona. Day 51 Day 59 I swear I have food! The cabinets. You see? Mm-hm. Bird food. Very good. Let's see the shelves. A bowl, a plate, a pot... Very nice...a pan... 30 guests may just show up for dinner and you can't decide what dish to set for them. It's organized because I washed dishes. Right, organized. Of course. Organizing nothing is easy. - What? - You can't go on like this. Like what? Like this. What's wrong? I don't know. I'm here. Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing here. I feel stupid. You're not stupid. It's normal you wonder about it. Everything is new. We can't go on like this. You have a real city out there. You've taken too long a trip just to stay in, right? Go do things, meet people, say hi to your neighbors, bake them a cake. Don't gringos love cakes? Well, you should buy it or you'll poison them to death. Explore. Wander. You're no different. Take advantage of being a single guy. Look, I'm smoking in the apartment. I can't believe it. Bad boy. Day 71 Should I turn it on? I've got a ton of stuff to cut. Right, but put it over a low flame to heat it up slowly. And now toss in the rabbit. No, not rabbit! They don't eat rabbit here. They have them as pets. What did you buy? Chicken? - Is that okay? - Sure, it's fine. You've got rosemary? Yeah. Do I add it now? Where? On the chicken? Wait on it. Good. So, show me how you've cut the onion. How many carrots do I put in? No! Who cut that? A monkey with a razor? Why do you say that? Dice it, girl, smaller! I don't have time! They're on their way. Well, you should have started earlier. You weren't around earlier! Who's coming? Paul and Lisa. Did you heat up the pan? - No, no, no, no, no! - I knew this was a fuking stupid idea, why didn't I buy fucking meal, like, you could take out... What? The oil first! Add the oil first! What does it matter? And you've got to dice the onion smaller! Alex...No! - What? - You're going to burn yourself! You always add salt to the onion! I've seen you do it! Yeah, but you're going to burn yourself like that. No, I haven't turned the stove on yet. Turn it on! And rinse the onion. Rinse the oil off the onion. No! It's already got oil on it! Dice the onion smaller and then put only the oil in. Listen, Alex. Grab an onion. - Grab an onion. - I already diced one! Grab an onion from there! Which, small or big? The small one. Is this one okay? Okay. Look at the onion and say: "Onion so small." Onion so small. "My boyfriend is sick of it all." My boyfriend is sick of it all. "But he's going to help his girl out." But he's going to help his girl out. "Because that's what love is all about." Because that's what love is all about. Very good. Now, set down the onion. Do I cut this one, too? Day 88 Okay, look. These are the freaky pics of places I think you'd like. I took this one on the way to Joshua Tree. Joshua Tree? Yeah, the desert where I went camping with Patrick and Lisa. I don't remember you telling me about camping. Yeah, when we went with Lisa to take her photos of the Salton Sea. Right, but I don't remember the camping part. Well, you must have forgotten. I didn't forget. Well, then I forgot. Who cares. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Look, this is actually a camouflaged antenna. I'll probably use these two in the project. Google bought this building for their offices. Day 91 Hello? Hey you, what's up? I'm really glad you called. I'm really glad because your mother left her panties here and she needs to come pick them up because they're going to ferment. No, no. I can't. I can't. No, no god damn it, I'm studying. I'm studying for my boards. No. So I can get permanent status, jerk. And not substitute anymore. I can't, man. I've got to cover a bunch of subjects and I'm already behind. Okay... Tomorrow? I don't know, whenever you want. When? Is Monday good? Okay, let's make it Monday. Come by the school and we'll grab lunch. Sound good? Yeah, I'm fine. No, man, I've got a lot going on, but I'm fine. Really, I'm fine, let me study. Yes, jerkoff. Okay, come on. Bye. Yes. Me, too. Come on, please let me study... Day 93 Hey. Are you there? Hello? Hello. How are you? - Hello? - Can you hear me? Fine, fine. I'm doing great. How about you? Good, just working. I can hear you. Go ahead. Working. Here. Did you go out this weekend? Yeah. I'm there. Well, I'm here. I'm not there, I'm here, which is your there. Very funny. Hello? Can you hear me? - Hello, baby! - No, studying, I'm studying. Hello! - How's it going? - Studying. How's it going? Really bad. I've even been considering not taking them... Well, get on it. You're a smart boy. I'm sure you'll do great. Alex! Yeah? Hello! I can call you later if you're busy. No, don't worry. So what did you do this weekend? Um...I went with Lisa... to East L.A. And we ended up in this square called Placita Mariachi. It's where all the mariachis go... You're frozen. Look. Look who I've got here. I've got a surprise. What? Wait. Hey, Paco. Taco? What are you talking about? Look at him, look at him. No, no. Oh, Paco! Your parents are there? - Can I say hi to your mother? - No, no, no. They're not there? Off you go! Can you hear me? I only see little bits. Bits of what? All I can see... Now all I see is a dog's butt. - There. - No. Paco's not here anymore. - He's not here. - Ah. Well, he's... You're frozen. Are you frozen? No...You're such a goon. I'm gonna let you go, okay? Day 101 Cheers? Hey you, cheers! You'll be drunk for your meeting. No, I've still got three hours. So you'll have time to puke at home. Is the food any good? Not as good as yours. It's not? Let me try... Let me try! You are a real chef now. You know what I feel like doing? Yes, yes, I do know. You're sucking on a fork. Should I cut a hole in the screen and inseminate you? Sure. And I'll email you the baby. We could try it again. I get the giggles. But that's fine. Funny and sexy, isn't it? I feel like an idiot getting naked in front of a computer. You jerk off watching porn, don't you? Yeah, but that's healthy masturbation. That's different. It's good. Give me a kiss here. Now, here. Here. Now what? Do we touch ourselves? Jesus Christ, Sergi. Okay, okay, okay. Should I go to the bed? Take your pants off. My pants? That's it. Take off your dress. Show me that little ass. My ass? Hey, you had this all prepared. Now tell me what you'd do to me. If I were there. I'd make you... ...dinner. Okay. What else? I'd suck on your toe. I'd lick my way up. All the way up your leg... ...till I got to your thigh. I'd nibble on you, like this. I'd spread your legs open, really wide. I'd lick around your pussy, but without touching yet. And all of a sudden, I'd flip you over. I'd flip you over and nibble your ass. And I'd use these fingers... ...to touch you. I'd keep nibbling my way up your back. Until I get to your neck and I grab tight on to your hair. Until you told me to stop. Stop, you're hurting me. And I nibble on your ear. And I'd ask, "You like it?" "You like feeling my dick on your back?" And you...You'd be so wet that you'd start dripping. And I fuck you, I fuck you hard. Yeah, like that, like that. Day 104 No, wait a second, I've got a packege. How long do you think? So what time do you think? 4 AM, ok. 4 AM pick up, do you think this is enough time? For the sunrise? OK... Perfect...OK...eh Nonono, don't worry...don't worry, is fine, I've got massive... You'r such a dirty bitch, such a one track wagon...No! Trunk.. Day 106 Day 1 10 Day 1 14 Day 120 Baby! Hi. How are you, my love? Great. - Can you hear the music? - Yeah, I can. - It's cumbia! - Yeah, I can hear it. We went out dancing at our friends' concert and I loved it. You're trashed, aren't you? Little bit... Little bit. You're going to get your way and I'll end up liking salsa. Come on, I'm going to show you what I learned. Come on, Sergi! I don't feel like it right now. Look, it's four steps. Two to one side and two to the other. Come on! No, I don't feel like it. I don't! Please! Why are you acting this way? Alex. My boards were yesterday. That was yesterday? How'd it go? What does it look like? Bad?! Total shit. What happened? I don't want to talk about it now. Yesterday I did, but not today, alright? I'm sorry. I feel so bad... Yeah, sure. I can see you're crushed. Day 128 What do you want me to tell you? I don't know. What did you do today? Today I did the same as yesterday and the same as the day before and the same as the day before the day before. You say you don't want me to feel bad for you and then you throw this at me. I don't want you to feel bad for me. It's just the way it is. Can we talk about something other than our relationship? Sure. What do you want to talk about? I don't know. We've always talked about millions of things. About the world, about everything. Sure. But we didn't have the obligation to talk before. We don't have to talk if you don't want to. No. We don't have to. Day 132 Another camouflaged antenna! Where are you? And camouflaged rock antennas, too! So freaky! I thought we set a time to talk? Yes, I know. But we're running late. I don't know what time we'll finish. Don't wait up, just in case. Kisses. Day 135 Day 136 Day 14 1 Look! Look! Wait, no. You're not here! You can't see. Look, Alex. You see this, Alex? Your clothes, here, every fucking morning. What do you want me to do? And you've got all your things, your people, your photos, your fucking books! Sergi, stop! It's... It's... It's everything, Alex. It's everything. It's everything, Alex. Like this, Alex. You remember this? You're acting like a child. And you know what? When I go out, there's always someone asking about you. And they say, "Hey, how's Alex doing?" "Yeah, she's great. She's really happy." And on every corner and in every bar... I find some crap that reminds me of you. Like this, for example. Like this. Look at me. Sergi, please. See? Don't do it. Set it down, please. And you know the funniest part? Later, I have to clean all this shit up by myself. Don't do it. Day 142 Day 155 Where are you? It's been two weeks. Say something. Fucking anything. That you're alive. Or just that you haven't gotten shot out there, in some gutter. Anything. Alex, where are you? Alex, I'm sorry I hurt you. I don't want to ask anything of you. I hate having to ask you to do something because I know you hate it, too. I know that if I ask you to write me, you'll start with the whole space thing. You need space. What space? How much space? What's so important in this space that I always have to stand outside it? Like always. Like always? Is now when you need space? Like always. Like always? Like always. Alex, Where are you? Day 160 Dear Sergi, I'm writing you from one of those cheesy roadside motels that you always say you'd like to fuck in. I needed to get out of LA. I let myself get lost on the road. I ended up in Silicon Valley to take some pictures. It was Sunday. Nothing but closed company headquarters. Everything looked phantasmagorical, more deserted than the deserts I'd just spent days crossing. I took a lot of photographs. The last one, just as the day was ending, was at a server farm where these companies store our data. I was thinking that the last few months of our relationship could be physically stored there. In the middle of an immense empty parking lot, away from the pressure I was under in LA, I realized. I told you I had discovered things that I don't want to give up. I don't want to give you up, Sergi. But I don't want to ask for your forgiveness this time. If there's one thing I've learned since I left, it is accepting my own yearnings, as well as my contradictions. But you deserve something better than that. I'm dying to see you. I'll call you when I get home. Day 162 I've been thinking about us a lot lately. You and I are so different in many ways. You know I don't believe in better halves or nonsense like that. I think it's fucked up. I think we want different things. Not deep down... Well, maybe in some things deep down... but not in what's important, right? I mean... I mean, we're different, but we complement one another. And I don't know why, but something joins me to you, an invisible bond and I take it everywhere, and it gives meaning to what I do, to things, to everything. I know I hurt you. Forgive me. I know I said I wasn't going to apologize because I don't feel guilty, but I don't care. If it makes you realise how much I need you, then, I'm sorry... Some things will never change. I'll always have a hard time telling you what I'm feeling because... I think you already know what I'm feeling. That you always know what I feel just by looking at me. That's why I don't always tell you that I love you... ...because I figure you already know. But then I realize that it's not the same to know something as hearing someone tell you. I need to tell you I love you more often. I love you so much. Life seems so gray when you're not around to make me laugh. Well, I haven't made you laugh much lately. I understand. But I don't think I have the strength. You leave all of a sudden and now you want to come back as if nothing had happened. No, not in the same way. A different way. We'll make it up. That's a low blow. Dance with me. Come on... Come on... Day 171 Let's see here. Flights... Barcelona, Atlanta, Reus, Manchester, Rome. And Los Angeles. 100 euros. Not bad. No wait, no. Atlanta, yes. It's Barcelona, Atlanta, Los Angeles. That makes... 880... What day? No. That's during student evaluations. What day is your opening? The 8th. But don't bother. I'll be slammed the days leading up to it and running around. Yeah, but I want to be there while you're running around, like a sparring partner. L.A. is waiting for me! The 3rd is okay, isn't it? The 3rd and we said the return trip could be at the beginning of September, right? Have they said anything about renewing your contract in September? Nothing yet, no. You seem so calm. Fuck everything. Holy shit. This is really pricey. It's all so expensive in early September. Well...I don't know. Get a later flight. No, I'd lose out on work then. So...don't buy a return flight. Sure. We can go on the run. I'm serious. You're nuts. No! Well, yeah, a little. But I'd like you to be here. Alex, what would I do there? I don't know...We've got my apartment. And we can both live off my grant. And I can play house-husband? Well, you could find something. They teach music here, too. Private lessons. I don't know. And how would we pay for the apartment in Barcelona? We could sublet it. Or leave it and get another. There's no reason to live in the same one forever, right? So when we come back in December, we're in Barcelona with no apartment and no job. On an adventure, right? Alex! Come on, think straight. We've been apart for months. But now we've got a couple together and then we only have three more to go. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine, won't it? Won't it? Tell me. What? What you're not telling me. You remember the visit from the gallerist I mentioned? Well, he liked my work. But apparently, he wants something bigger, next year and... he wants to finance me to work on it full time. So you can stay. Listen, I want to be with you. What does it matter where we are? You don't want to be with me, you want me to be with you. We had plans. I liked my life. I know but in a relationship, plans are for two. We can redo them together, can't we? And the baby? I don't know. Later. When? A year from now? Five? Ten? Never? When we feel ready again. I already am ready to have one. And you were, too. I've waited a year. We've done what you wanted. And I'm still ready. Sergi, listen to me. Come here. We'll stay here a while and then we can go somewhere else. Barcelona? Barcelona. London? London. Whatever you want. Do you realize you can't have me waiting forever? You can't have it all. You choose. What? You're going to make me choose? Yes. Really? After I stayed so long in Barcelona for you... Now you can't come here? At least try it? I'm sorry. Choose. Day 201 I'm coming. Hello. What are you doing here? Like this, no call, no warning, all of a sudden... Where are you going? I don't know. A hotel or something. No! What are you talking about? This is the bathroom door? I don't know. I'd pictured it on the other side. I don't know why, I'd pictured it all the opposite. It's really different. I don't know. I pictured it bigger. What's this? It's new. Well... second-hand. I bought it at a flea market. Do you like it? Yeah. Yeah, it's really nice. It looks kind of like the one in Barcelona, doesn't it? The one at home. The one at...my home. You want something to drink? A tea... a beer... Water? I'm hungry. I've got pasta. I've got cream of vegetable soup I made yesterday... Sure, soup would be good. I had to bring you something. You'd toss a souvenir back in my face. Are you done? With it all? The photographs... Almost. The photos are at the lab. I just need to...organize them. Do you want to go to sleep? No. Are you tired? No, no. I slept on the plane. Not much though. It's really uncomfortable. The jetlag will last a few days. I figured. It lasted four days for me. It's better to stay awake so your body gets used to it. Thank you. How long are you staying? However long you want. I mean, I've got a flight back in a month, I can extend it by 15 days... or I can just leave if it sounds like a lot. What do you want to do? I like the idea of the road trip. Want some? Whiskey with vegetable soup. Does it burn? Do you want an ice cube? No, it's fine. It's really good. It's really good. Yeah? Why did you come here? To surf. I don't know...I don't know. I'm glad you're here. You weren't expecting it. You crossing the Atlantic without knowing why... I expected no less of you, Sergi. What would have surprised me would be you crossing over knowing why. I hadn't expected that welcome either. What did you expect? That you'd jump desperately into my arms. Like in the movies. They kiss at the last second and everything is fixed like some miracle happened. That would have been a good plan. What about the next day? I guess they're still unhappy. They take it to court and get divorced. You're stupid. Come on. What did I do wrong? Nothing. You did nothing wrong. Nothing? No.
