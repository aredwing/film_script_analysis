I had a great guy, sights on college, art school... and a dream of life beyond. - Good morning, Arthur. - It's a decoy, Arthur. The AK-47's in her backpack. Yeah, right. You tell yourself to count the days and put up with the shit. You tell yourself these people are illusions, passing scenery. Hey, snap these, babe! They were nothing to me. I just use them for my art. No blading in the hall. I don't want to have to tell you again! - Okay,jockstrap sniffers, say cheese. - Action. Look out! Coming through! Most of all, I avoided the snares, skating past the obstacles... the way everybody who can manage it does. Guh-ding went the little green frog Guh-ding went the little green frog one day And his eyes went aggh-aggh-gung Okay, hold these suckers down on their backs. Ready for surgery. Nail 'em good. Last year we had one of these ribbits jump off... during the incision of a pulmonary vein. It weren't pretty. - What is it, Rita? - I can't do it. - Flake. - Get off her shit already. Hello, Rita. Take the scalpel. Earth to Rita. It's so defenseless. Frogs, they don't have feelings like we do, Rita. But their cardiovascular system is an excellent model for ours. In other words, their little hearts work a lot like ours do. Young man. Young man, stop when I'm talking to you! What class should you be in? But then something happened, unexpected. I felt it before I knew it. Excuse me. If you're new, please take a seat. I'll get the paperwork later. If I'd known you were coming, I'd have ordered you a frog. Where were we? Class, let's concentrate on the frogs. On the frogs. Let's start slicing, and this ain't pizza. Watch it. Let's all show Rita we can do this. Okay? Rita, are you with us? Take the scalpel now. We've been working on this for three weeks. We're holding things up. Let's not waste any more time. I'm gonna count to three and you'll take the scalpel, okay? One. Two. Three. Hey, let's do it! - No, I can't do it. - Come on, let's go. I can't! - We're gonna talk in detention then. - No! - Class, anyone else having a problem? - What's the deal with detention? He's always giving her shit. He's such an asshole. So make him stop. - Okay, I'll do it. - What? I'm gonna do it, all right? All right, class, you hear that? Rita's gonna do it. That a girl. Way to go. She's now aiming it at the point of incision. What are you doing? What the hell are you doing, young lady? Hey, I'm talkin' to you! - I'll see you in detention also. - I don't even go here. It wasn't over. I could feel it... like a charge in the air before a storm. What else does he do? He... he gets really close... and he touches my chest. - What's going on? - Rita's making up shit about Buttinger. I'm not! Okay? I'm not! He gets behind me... and he rubs himself on my ass. - You should be glad someone does. - Shut up, Cindy. - She's crazy. Everyone knows that. - She's telling the truth. He does it to me too. You don't count, Violet. You do it with everyone. Well, at least I know what I'm doing. - If half the stories are true-- - Give it a rest, Cindy. Look. You're the assholes for letting him get away with it. No. You're the asshole for letting him get away with it ! Excuse me. Who the fuck are you? You're all assholes. Because when that son of a bitch puts his hands on her... you should tell yourselves he's putting his hands all over you. Or you, or you, or you! Because he sure as hell would if he could. So what are we supposed to do? - Make sure he never does it again. - How? - We stick together. - Gimme a break. So, are we together? Good. We're just gonna sit here until we learn something about the heart. You know, Rita... you have very little confidence... for someone with so much potential, talent. What is that? What is that over there? You're very pretty. Pretty and talented aren't the same. What? Says who? That's where you're wrong. You know, you just don't appreciate your value as a woman. You know, I think you're way ahead of all the girls your age. I forgot my notebook. Well, get it. What are you doing here, Madeline? - What is going on here? - Don't let us stop you. - Go on with what you were doing. - Pervert! - Come here, Red. - That young lady is in detention today. We need to talk. - Keep your hands off Rita. - And Violet. And whoever the fuck else you do this to. - How does that feel? - Fucking little punk! That's right. You better move. You better keep moving. Or what? This is outrageous! This is absolutely outrageous! I'm a teacher! Madeline. Madeline! Come on! You don't believe Rita. She's emotionally unstable. - I'm not unstable! - I didn't mean it like that. I'm not unstable! Leave her alone! Stop! If you ever put your hands on me again... I'll snip your little nuts off with my toenail clippers. All right? This is great! Buttinger's such a fuck! All right, let's go. Let's go. Get out of here. Go! Come on. Can you get up? Next time you think about fucking with some young girl... you think about this first. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! What if someone saw us? Oh, my God, what are we gonna do? - We should get the hell outta here. - Oh, my God, we're in trouble. -Just stay calm. - We are in so much-- Who was she, anyway? I think we should all go somewhere together. Does this bitch always talk in exclamation marks? We should all just go home. This is gonna be what it's gonna be. ''If you ever put your hands on me again... I'm gonna snip your little nuts off with my toenail clippers.'' I said that? The dork! Shit. - Maddy, sweetheart, did I scare you? - No, no. Get in here. - Hi. - Hi. Okay. Come in. Thank you. Spica in Virgo. AJune sky. - How did you get here? - I climbed. No. I mean, how did you find my house? You dropped this. Sorry, it's wet. It's okay. Do you have a dry shirt or something? I'm really kind of wet. - Yeah, yeah, sure. - Thank you. - So where do you live, anyway? - Mostly in my head. I'm just passin' through. - That's not very safe, you know. - I look in their eyes. If I don't think it's safe, I don't get in the car. - How can you tell? - It's a question of really looking. Mad, pick it up. Look, I heard what happened. - Is that your boyfriend? - Where are you? Just call me. I love you. Here, put this on. Thank you. - So where do you go to school? - Don't. I was thrown out. - For what? - For thinking for myself. So tell me about Buttinger. Is that his name? God, I have never done anything like that in my whole life. Rita Faldes isn't even my friend. None of those girls are. That's what's so weird. Well, she is now, for life. - Do you mind? - No, no, go ahead. There's some beef jerky under that pile. I can get you some. It's okay. Do you mind if I sleep on your floor tonight? Yeah. Are you sure? Good. - Good morning, hon. - Yeah. Are you gonna eat that? I was thinking about it. Yeah. Did Ethan stay over, Maddy? It's only a girl. - Who is she? - She doesn't believe in stairs? - Who is she? - She's my drug dealer. Thought I lost you. - I don't even know your name. - She says the next morning. - Don't worry. You're not my type. - Oh? What's this? That's my art stuff. It's a camera. Legs. What about 'em? That's what people call me. I vault without poles. That sort of thing. What are you doing? Come on. You're gonna fall. - I'm not watching this. I'm not. - Come and get it. - I'm afraid of heights. - Oh, how afraid? Are you this afraid? Does this scare you? Come on, Legs. If it was that important to you, you'd come get it. - I wanna puke! Come on! - Come on up here. Dance with me. - No way! - Come on. Oh, boy. Don't worry, I'll get it. Don't worry. Legs-- Don't! Come on. Oh, God. Careful! Legs, it's not worth it. Yeah, it is. You don't-- It's okay. Oh, God. Give it to me. Almost. Okay. - Easy. - It's okay. You're a frigging lunatic, you know that? God! - So is this good-bye? - It depends on how many bottles I find. Figure I need $50 before I move on. Nine hundred and eighty bottles to go. I hope you don't find all the bottles you need today. Look, there's a house about a half mile or so up the river. It's abandoned. If you needed a place to stay, I mean. Thank you. I gotta go. I'm late. Don't take any shit. How could you just do that and not tell me? - Because it's not about you, Ethan. - Why didn't you go to Mr. Parks? If Buttinger did that to you-- pressed you against the blackboard, grabbed your balls, what would you do? - That's different. - How? It just is, Maddy, and you know it. All right. I'd kick his ass. Where were you last night? I called. I passed out early. Come on. Live dangerously. Walk me to class. I'll be your substitute for the next few days. Mr. Buttinger is out due to a minor accident. Are you Madeline Wirtz? You're wanted in the principal's office. This note was intercepted between two students in class. Is there any truth to it? It says we beat up Buttinger. - Things got out of hand. - So it's true? - He grabbed me. - So she busted his nose. What? - He was sexually harassing Rita. - And you. This is a very serious charge. What are you girls? Some sort of gang here? Girls who run with foxes? That sort of thing? So you find this funny. Okay, I am going to suspend you all for two weeks... for your conduct in this office and for assaulting a teacher. I will have you escorted out. Mr. Parks, I need to stop by the art room, please. - I don't think so. - My application goes out tomorrow. - You should've thought of that before. - That isn't fair. - Two and a half weeks. - What about Mr. Buttinger? - You leave that to me. - He should be fired. Three weeks. Would you like to keep going? - It's all my fault. - Yeah. Why don't you kill yourself? - Why don't you just drop dead? - Savage wit. Don't you get dizzy constantly looking down on her? I can't go home. My parents will kill me. We can go to my house and watch TV. TV sucks, man. It's lame. I know where we can go. Mr. Parks, this is Rita's mother... and I'm very concerned about the situation with Rita. You do a lovely mommy. Maybe you will call him for me? Sure. I'll do it better on the phone. - Good. - Where the fuck are we going? I'll call your parents too if you want. Yeah, whatever. Isn't it beautiful? Bet it's haunted. I bet the ghost that I saw when I was little is still here. You saw a ghost? Really? - I saw a UFO. - Did you really? Whoa! There's a tree in here! We can build a tree house. So I hear you got suspended. For thinking for myself. Then cheers. Get away from me! I just found it. We all got suspended together. Mr. Parks is such an asshole. Yeah, he wouldn't let Maddy get his ar-- her art. It's my portfolio. - It has to go out tomorrow. - Then we should get it. - What do you mean? - We should go to the school and get it. If there's a utility hatch on the roof or basement, we'll go in and get it. If I got caught, I would be in so much trouble. - She took that risk for you. - Yeah. I'm down for a felony. - A felony? - This is way risky. We could be like dead gerbils up here. This is where they put the bad kids. I need to get outta here. It's not funny. - Where's the thing? - We're gonna get lost in here. - We're gonna die. - Here it is. Here it is. Thank God! This is so weird. - I can't do it. - Come on. Guys, please don't go anywhere without me. We're not going anywhere. We're right here. - Oh, fuck. - It's okay. Come on, Rita. You can do it. - Oh, good job! - Good girl. Come on! Don't you like flashlights? I always wanted one when I was little. - Hand this to Violet. - Not like a normal flashlight. Like one that would suck up the darkness like a vacuum cleaner. Shut up already. I gotta get my stuff. I only knew how to draw one thing in art class: a penis! - Okay, here. - Calm down. Just put the stuff in there. One more. One more. - Did you hear what I said? - No, was it funny? Okay, here it is. Okay, I got 'em. I got everything. I got 'em. I got 'em. I've got one more, though, so wait. Great, okay. I got 'em, I got 'em. Front door! Front door! Let's go. - See if you get it. - You got it. - Got anything? - Not yet. Okay, I got you. Shit! This way, this way! This is Simon. There was a small fire in the art room. Over. Yeah, it's probably a chemical reaction to something. Copy that. Over. Did you see-- - I wonder what happened to them. - I found more candles. You and your fucking weed. You're a tea head. Where were you guys? We need more candles. Where'd you get all these candles? - Look, it's a shrine. - Where'd you find these? Was it laying around in this house? Probably like witches here. - Crazy shit. - That's right. Oh, my God. - What are you doing? - Check out her pouch. I'm commemorating tonight. This is so I'll always remember tonight... and you, Maddy. And Goldie. And Violet. And Red. - Fire? - Because it nourishes... and also destroys if you don't respect it. That's how we were tonight. Do it to me. Hold still, okay? Don't be scared. Oh, my God. Is it done? It's beautiful! I love it! We're like those girls who run with foxes. You're such a geek! We're like those geeks that run with foxes. I'm a runaway geek, goddamn it! We're supposed to do our portfolios. You forgot? No, I remember. I just don't have mine. It's not at my house. - What's up? - Hey. What is this? It's a-- I got a tattoo last night. - You're pissed. - No. I'm happy that you beat up a teacher... got a tattoo, stood me up. Hit your head or something lately? What's the deal? You should just do your portfolio and get it in. I'll do mine alone. We're hanging out tonight, right? Why do you keep doing this? Are you some kind of freak? What is the matter with you? Don't you have any respect for yourself? This room looks like a drug den. I want these candles out of here before you burn the whole house down! We're going to be late. So, we'll be at the medical convention in Miami. Remember? The number's on the fridge. Don't forget to feed the bird. Oh, there's a girl or whatever to see you. Honey, you want me to stay home with her? She's 1 7. She's old enough to take care of herself. I gotta pee! - What's that? - It's nothing. It's a cut. Would you just get out? Get out. Get out! - Get dressed. We'll be late for school. - I'm getting a ride... with a friend. She doesn't have any friends. My stash. - That shit can kill you. - So can aspirins. It only takes 60 aspirins to kill yourself. Hey. Put that money back, young lady. First you gotta take the safety off. Put it back. Go ahead. Put me out of my misery. It was just a joke. If I hear any more shit about 60 aspirins... or one more of your fucking mood swings, I'm going to tickle you to death. Do you understand me? - Yes, ma'am. - Hey, come here. - Hello? - Come in. - Did you bring your lunch? - No. How are you? Hi. Hi. - Something to eat? - No. I brought Charlie Deen, the galloping machine. Oh, man! Figures. I got it in second grade. This I brought too. I brought another candle, but it's nicer than the others. That one's my favorite. I haven't decided what I wanna do with this one yet. Why don't you leave it like that? It's nice. I don't know. You will not believe what I got. Read it. Open it. '' Dear Violet, you don't know me. I'm only a freshman, but I feel like I owe you my life. Mr. Buttinger's been coming after me lately, but he won't anymore. I wish I could've been there. Thanks, thanks, thanks. Love, Anonymous.'' Fuckin' cool, huh? So this is headquarters. What are you doing here? We have a little problem, girls. It's called Lloyd Buttinger. - What about him? - This nasty rumor got started... and now these girls are signing a petition to have him fired. Wow. - What's your point, Dana? - Our point is... you girls started it, so you'd better stop it. Or what, big guy? Or you'll be fucking sorry. If Coach Buttinger loses his job 'cause of you sluts... you'll pay. - Shut up, Dana. - That's pretty big talk, Dana. You know, Violet, I was thinking about you last night. That's funny, Dana, because I was thinking about you too. Oh, yeah, that fuzzy little head of yours buried between my thighs... just blowin' away at what you love best. Why don't you tell all your friends here how much you love the way it tastes? In your fucking dreams! Dana, why don't you and your little boys here... run back to Coach Buttinger and tell him he deserves whatever the hell he gets? Let's go, man. Come on. So is it true, the stuff about Buttinger? Yeah, it's true. Hey, Bobby, do you know Rita? - You're in my French class, right? - Oui. I'll see you around. Bon soir, Bobby. Good night. See ya. - I'm such a hopeless romantic. - So perfect. So great. Oui. It's like panty hose. You have to unroll it. Like this. Okay? Yeah, but am I the one... that's gonna have to actually put it on and do it? It's more fun that way. - What are you guys doing? - Talking about penises. God! What flavor? This is Condom 1 01 . Now, we'll get into flavors next week. How do you know if a guy's got a really big schlong... before you actually-- You get an eye for it. Okay, smartie. What about-- No, not him. Him. - That guy over there. - Him? - Violet! - Him? - That guy right there? - Violet, stop it! Bushel of potatoes. Double meat! How do you know if a guy's good in bed? By how many times he makes me come. Do you wanna come inside my house Do you wanna show me things I've never seen before I don't wanna tie you down I just wanna tie you up Do you wanna come inside my house I wrote that myself. What do you think? I think you need to get laid. I know. I masturbate, though. Have I gotta hear about it? Oh, is our little bald one not familiar with the art... of autoerotic exhilaration? This is like a bad tampon commercial. Hey, smoke my dick, you fuckin' whores! - Fuck you, dick! - Stupid redhead. You guys, I'm afraid of heights... but I'm not afraid of getting high. I'm afraid of an island with no boys on it. - Are you afraid of anything? - I'm afraid of Legs in a dress. I'm afraid of myself. I have been out all night looking for you. Get in the car. - Legs, it's okay. - No, it's not. Who's Audrey? A friend. Audrey's my mom. How? In a car. She was drunk. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, me too. Do you have a dad? Yeah, somewhere I do. Maddy, I'm thinking about moving on in a couple of days. - To where? - To wherever. Somewhere. Do you have to go alone? Would you take someone with you? Is that someone sure? Is she cut out for the unknown? Sometimes the unknown will disappoint you. If I told you that I loved you, would you take it the wrong way? What do you mean by ''wrong''? It's just that I'm not-- And you're-- I'll take it however you want me to, Maddy. Look. You can see Spica in Virgo. Summer's on its way. Hi. Can I talk to you? I'm scared. Dana and I got in this fight... and he started pushing me and hitting me. I took off on him, but he's out looking for me... and I'm sort of scared to walk home alone. Why'd you come here? You guys just sort of have this reputation. I was kind of hoping you'd help me out. Thanks for doing this. It's no big deal. I'd do it for any girl. You guys really messed up Buttinger. - You know, they fired him. - He deserved it. I know. But Dana says it's all bull. '' Dana says, Dana says.'' God, Cindy, get a mind of your own! I can go the rest of the way alone. It's okay. It's okay. Laurel's not far. Yeah, but-- You should go home. What's goin' on? We'll take over from here, babe. Look, Dana, let's just forget it. Why don't we go for a ride? You watch too many corny movies. Yeah? We think you girls are gettin' a little too big for yourselves. Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about it? What you've been wanting me to do for a long time. Cindy knows you have. That's why she's comin'. She's a witness. One girl's word against another. Maybe this is just a bad idea. We're just gonna fuck around. Why don't you get in the car? We got a fighter here. Get her in the car. - Fuck off!. Cindy! - What do you want me to do? Get your hands off me, damn it! Fuck you! Let me out of here! Let her out! Tell them to let her out, you stupid fuck. Let her out. Come on. Get outta the car, bitch. Get out! Legs, get in. - Get in. Let's go. - Go! Damn! It's my fucking car! I can't drive! You guys, shit! Jesus Christ! Hold on! Have a nice walk, boys! What should we do with the car? Keep it. We deserve it. - After all of our hard work? - Shit, man. Come here! Get in! - What's going on? - What's up? Maddy almost got raped, and we just stole this car. What? Oh, my God, I can't believe we're doing this! Fuck you, Dana Taylor! Where are you taking us? It's not what you've been told There's nowhere we won't go What's a beautiful girl like you doing racing in a place like this? - Winning. - Winning Shit, red light! Excellent! - Let's go! - Yes! Where're we goin'? To the beach. Let's go to the beach. Cops! Oink! Oink! Legs, we can explain this. Shut up! What's up? Talk to me. Come on. Talk to me. I don't like police stations. Carjacking. resisting arrest... assault with a deadly weapon. You girls fell in with a bad element. I hope you've learned from it. I'm going to turn you over to the care of your parents. They, better than I, know what's best for you. Don't let me see you in here again. Now, Margaret Sadovsky. I think some adult guidance, supervision... could benefit you too, young lady. Because you have no legal guardian-- Is that right? Yes. And because you appear to be the most culpable of the defendants... and have a previous record... I hereby sentence you to six months to a year... at a youth correctional facility. No. - No, you can't do this. - Be quiet. You don't understand. She was just trying to protect me. That's enough out of you! No, we're telling the truth! You've got it all wrong. They're the ones that lied. They lied! - Cindy, goddamn it, tell the truth! - Watch your mouth in my courtroom. There's no justice. Fuck your courtroom! - You won't get away with this! - If she goes, we all go. Don't take any shit. No dates, no boys. You hear me? Maybe she's better off, Maddy. Look, she'll be okay. Your Honor, we have new evidence to be brought before the court. I'd like to request a recess to consult with my client. The court is in recess for an hour and a half. Thank you very much. -Judge Holifield? - Yes? I need to talk to you about something. Yes? I lied. Hi. Can I please speak to Rita? Rita's not allowed to come to the phone. Thanks anyway. Yeah, Mom. - There's someone here to see you. - Hi. Girl, what're you doin' in my house? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm at the library. - Bye, Mom. - Bye. Wow! This place is great! - Pull up a chair. - What are you doin'? You'll see. Come on, be here. - Oh, yeah. - ''I put my hand in his pocket--'' '' Never wanted more than a rocket!'' It's Red! - Maddy, it's Rita! - Yeah. - Can you talk to her? - Hold on. Hold on. '' Been eating any... meat and potatoes lately?'' You big slut! Can I just type? Yeah, talk to her for a while. I gotta do something. Hello. Can I speak to Goldie, please? Goldie isn't here. Who is this? Maddy Wirtz. Is that her dad? Goldie hasn't been home in two days. If you see her, you tell her to get home. What? Maddy, what's happening? Goldie ran away. I'm lookin' for Goldie. Yeah? And who are you? Tell me where she is. Goldie, get up. Goldie, come on, get up. Let's go. Come on. What are you doing here? All right, all right. If I ever catch you near her again... I will fucking kill you! Come on. - Come on, Goldie. - Get off me! We should stay with her, make sure she doesn't try to leave. Leave me alone. I can't stay here all night. I have to go home. We'll all take turns, okay? Maybe she's hungry. - I have some chocolates. - I don't want this. Get off me! - What do you want? - You know what I want. - Here's some pudding. - I can't. - Fuck you, man! Fuck you! - You know that I can't. Get the fuck away from me, then. Everyone leave me alone! Just leave me the fuck alone. - I don't know what to do. - Maybe we should call a doctor. - No, it'll just get her in trouble. - Get out of here. I'll stay with her tonight. It'll be all right. - I'll stay. It's okay. - Fuck. We should go. I'll walk you home. - Leave me alone! - Maddy, I'll be back later. Fuck. Legs? Shit! You guys! Hey, lady. Hi. Thank God you're back. Hi. What's wrong? It's Goldie. What? She's upstairs. She's sick. - How long has she been like this? - Two days. - She throwing up? - She was. What're we gonna do? Yes? We're here about Goldie. - What do you mean? Where is she? - She's in trouble. We need $1 0,000 from you to help her. What in the hell has she done now? It's for rehab. Goldie has a drug problem. - What are you talking about? - She's sick. You tell me where she is, and I'll take care of her. No, I think you've done enough. I don't know who you think you are, but I'm her father. - Didn't they send you away? - Fuck you! Get out of my house! No, not without the money. - Where is she? - No. - Maybe you'd like to tell the police. - Why don't we call the police? Why don't we call them and tell them what a lousy father you are... and that they should lock you up for beating your daughter? What? I never beat her. Is that what she told you? Stop blaming her for everything! You gonna give us the money or not? I want you, you and you out of my house. Now. I'm calling the police. Put the phone down. Put it down! You give us $1 0,000 right now or you're coming with us. - Put the gun down. - Or what, Maddy? It's not loaded. What kind of asshole would keep a loaded gun in the house? - Wait. - We can't-- No! Not until he gives me the money! Come on. Shit. Get the keys, Maddy. Pick them up off the table. Pick them up, Maddy, now! Come on, let's go. - Girls, please. - Move! You move! Maddy, drive. - Let's just talk about this. - Get in the fucking car. All right. - Legs, we can't do this. - Will you just drive? - This is crazy! - Don't choke on me. You don't have to obey her. You can pull the car over. Shut up! Just drive to the house. - What are you gonna do with him? - Don't know. Don't worry about it. - Shit! I'm gonna pull over. - No, you're not! I won't press charges. I swear. I will kill you. I don't care. Okay. Look, we're just gonna calm down, okay? I'm just gonna drive. Get out. - What are we gonna do with him? -Just get in. - Where's Goldie? - She's in here. She's awake. Go upstairs. Could I have some help? Maddy says it's okay. Let's go! Can you move? What the fuck happened? Sit. Come on, sit. Come here and help me tie him up. Come on! Take your socks off. Red, gimme your hand. You'll be okay. I'm just gonna think. Okay? Hold it on him. Talk to me. Tell me what you're doing. We're gonna call his wife and make her drop off the money. - Ransom? - That's kidnapping! That's just a word, Maddy. Don't let it scare you. You're what's scaring me. I'm just trying to make him do the right thing. - Not this way. - How? - He brought this on himself. - He is not the point. We are! God! We're the ones who live here. They're gonna find us. And when they do, we're the ones who are gonna pay for this. Like last time? Come on. This is-- This is for Goldie. This is about saving her life. And who we are to her. It's about who we are. You're doing it wrong. Yeah? I don't see you doin' it right. This is crazy! There's gotta be another way to go about this. - So what is it, Red? - I don't know what it is. Well, I'm out of ideas. Come on, Legs. I want him to see Goldie. - He doesn't give a shit about Goldie. - He's her father! She's right. You know what? Fathers mean nothing! They don't care. They mean nothing. This isn't about you. Maybe he'll come through for her this time. Maybe he'll come through for her this time. What the fuck is going on? - Someone call an ambulance! - Dad! - What's he doing here? - Violet, untie his hands. He's gonna be okay, Goldie. It went clean through. We have to stop this bleeding. He's okay. It went clean through. Oh, shit! Red! It was an accident. The gun went off. It's my fault. Look at me! - Okay? - Goldie, he's gonna be okay. We've gotta get him outta here. Can you take the girls out? No way! - I'll take care of him. - I'm not leaving you. Nobody's leaving. Let's get him to a hospital. Ready? One, two, three. - You're gonna be okay. I got him. - Easy, you guys. Put your weight on me. Hear me? - Easy. Easy. - Where are ya? I'm here. - Goldie, are you there? - Dad, I'm here. - Dr. Goldman, I've got you. - Down the stairs. - Easy, you guys. - Everybody just slow down. Keep him steady, Violet. Keep him steady. Dad... it's okay. All right. Careful, careful. Watch his head. - I'm sorry, man. - It was an accident. - I'm driving. - Where's Legs? - Shut it. - We've got to go! Go! Where are you going? You don't have to go. Stay with us. We're your family. Do you want to go with me? I'll tell you what. I'm gonna do this, okay? And when a car stops, you won't even have to think about it. You'll just know and you decide. You just do what feels right in your heart, okay? I'll never forget you. You're in my heart, Maddy. Goldie's dad claimed he shot himself. It was just stupid enough, the police believed it. He got Goldie into rehab, worked things out with her eventually. I've traveled since. Half the world. Art museums, bus stations, airports. I've never seen Legs again. The rest of us, we've drifted... but we embrace when we meet, veterans of a sort... bound together for life.
