uses less energy than any animal its size 4 00:01:01,333 -- 00:01:05,040 The Kangaroo is shaped by the land in which it lives 5 00:01:05,250 -- 00:01:08,915 one of the most challenging places on earth 6 00:01:41,666 -- 00:01:45,707 Australia is a vast ancient weathered land 7 00:01:45,916 -- 00:01:49,707 isolated from all others for 40 million years 8 00:01:49,916 -- 00:01:51,874 lt is a place of extremes 9 00:01:52,083 -- 00:01:56,332 more like another planet than another continent 10 00:02:31,916 -- 00:02:35,207 Travelling over Australia's 3 million square miles 11 00:02:35,416 -- 00:02:39,249 is like crossing an ocean of dry land 12 00:02:48,541 -- 00:02:53,999 Primeval landscapes belie its rich resourceful life 13 00:03:06,833 -- 00:03:11,874 Australia is almost equal in size to the continental United States 14 00:03:12,083 -- 00:03:16,915 lt is the driest vegetated continent on Earth 15 00:03:28,458 -- 00:03:32,957 Surrounded by three oceans it is the world's largest island 16 00:03:33,166 -- 00:03:37,165 lt shares no border with any other country 17 00:03:50,208 -- 00:03:56,040 Here some of the Earth's oldest rocks hold fossils from the dawn of life 18 00:04:00,583 -- 00:04:04,499 ln its heartland are mountain ranges that once rivalled Everest 19 00:04:04,708 -- 00:04:08,165 built up and worn down over time 20 00:04:12,166 -- 00:04:16,957 and remnants of a once vast inland sea 21 00:04:29,291 -- 00:04:33,082 Most of Australia's native animals are unique 22 00:04:33,291 -- 00:04:35,749 Their journey on this continental raft 23 00:04:35,958 -- 00:04:39,499 has taken them through cool forests and fiery deserts 24 00:04:39,708 -- 00:04:42,249 and changed them forever 25 00:04:42,458 -- 00:04:47,749 The survivors have been refined by poverty and uncertainty 26 00:04:52,333 -- 00:04:56,332 Some have climbed up out of adversity 27 00:05:04,125 -- 00:05:08,082 Some have outrun all their predators 28 00:05:15,791 -- 00:05:20,165 Most have adapted to hard fickle conditions 29 00:05:25,708 -- 00:05:30,124 A few are unchanged since the days of the dinosaurs 30 00:05:30,458 -- 00:05:33,040 Now sheer diversity of species 31 00:05:33,250 -- 00:05:37,165 spreads the risk that life is required to bear 32 00:05:43,833 -- 00:05:46,457 The story starts millions of years ago 33 00:05:46,666 -- 00:05:51,374 when Gondwana the great super continent began to break apart 34 00:05:53,666 -- 00:05:57,249 Africa South America and lndia were formed 35 00:05:57,458 -- 00:06:03,582 but Australia and Antarctica were still joined as one last giant land 36 00:06:03,791 -- 00:06:06,332 forested and lush 37 00:06:16,916 -- 00:06:19,832 By 50 million years ago the breakup was complete 38 00:06:20,041 -- 00:06:23,707 when Australia parted from Antarctica 39 00:06:24,791 -- 00:06:28,957 A massive ocean current began to flow around the South Pole 40 00:06:29,166 -- 00:06:34,540 and Antarctica's life perished under a blanket of ice and snow 41 00:06:37,458 -- 00:06:40,624 Australia pushed northwards from the freezing latitudes 42 00:06:40,833 -- 00:06:45,457 and remained isolated for the next 30 million years 43 00:06:46,416 -- 00:06:50,957 lt became an ark of survival for its cargo of ancient life 44 00:06:53,875 -- 00:06:56,499 Searing winds began to dry the land 45 00:06:56,708 -- 00:07:00,832 and its moist rainforest all but disappeared 46 00:07:01,291 -- 00:07:05,165 At the centre the desert was taking over 47 00:07:05,375 -- 00:07:08,540 Australia's plants and animals faced a choice 48 00:07:08,750 -- 00:07:12,665 adapt to the drying conditions or retreat 49 00:07:22,583 -- 00:07:26,915 Now the symbol of Australia's red heart is Uluru 50 00:07:27,125 -- 00:07:30,207 the Earth's largest exposed rock 51 00:07:30,416 -- 00:07:34,957 lt commemorates the relationship between life and this land 52 00:08:01,791 -- 00:08:05,457 Today Australia is the Earth's flattest continent 53 00:08:05,666 -- 00:08:10,207 lts mountains were worn to their stumps millions of years ago 54 00:08:13,291 -- 00:08:16,165 The Nullarbor plain on its southern coast 55 00:08:16,375 -- 00:08:20,082 has the world's longest unbroken coastal cliffs 56 00:08:20,291 -- 00:08:23,749 Once you could walk to Antarctica from here 57 00:08:43,041 -- 00:08:49,165 lf the dry Outback is a land ocean these parallel sand dunes are its waves 58 00:08:49,750 -- 00:08:54,749 Stretching beyond the horizons they cover nearly half of the continent 59 00:09:04,541 -- 00:09:07,374 Millions of years of rain and drying winds 60 00:09:07,583 -- 00:09:11,624 long ago leached the goodness from most of its soil 61 00:09:11,833 -- 00:09:18,082 ln the red centre there is no regular predictable pattern of rainfall 62 00:09:18,291 -- 00:09:24,915 Poor soils and a savage climate now challenge all life in this land 63 00:09:48,208 -- 00:09:51,499 Nature responded to the changing conditions 64 00:09:51,708 -- 00:09:55,207 The kangaroo started its journey as a marsupial possum 65 00:09:55,416 -- 00:09:57,540 the size of a mouse 66 00:09:58,625 -- 00:10:02,874 As forests contracted some kangaroos evolved to live in the trees 67 00:10:03,083 -- 00:10:06,082 and others learned to eat grass 68 00:10:09,666 -- 00:10:13,082 When food is plentiful the males are active 69 00:10:13,291 -- 00:10:16,082 and courtship disputes are traditionally settled 70 00:10:16,291 -- 00:10:18,874 with a round or two of kick-boxing 71 00:10:21,958 -- 00:10:26,374 Mothers and babies sensibly keep out of the way 72 00:10:46,833 -- 00:10:50,540 On most continents animals breed in response to the seasons 73 00:10:50,750 -- 00:10:53,707 ln Australia it is the availability of food 74 00:10:53,916 -- 00:10:57,082 that prompts the kangaroo to reproduce 75 00:11:01,416 -- 00:11:06,207 To capitalise on good times the mother can support a production line 76 00:11:06,416 -- 00:11:09,082 one joey in the pouch one at foot 77 00:11:09,291 -- 00:11:12,499 and another in the womb as an embryo 78 00:11:12,958 -- 00:11:14,582 She can even supply her babies 79 00:11:14,791 -- 00:11:17,999 with two different formulas of milk at the same time 80 00:11:18,208 -- 00:11:21,124 one for each generation of young 81 00:11:46,541 -- 00:11:51,290 The koala evolved from the same marsupial possum as the kangaroo 82 00:11:51,500 -- 00:11:54,165 When the baby is big enough to leave the pouch 83 00:11:54,375 -- 00:11:56,832 it rides on its mother's back 84 00:12:05,500 -- 00:12:06,915 Like the kangaroo 85 00:12:07,125 -- 00:12:10,207 the koala evolved in the moist rainforest 86 00:12:10,416 -- 00:12:15,874 As the forest dried it adapted to live on the leaves of the gum tree 87 00:12:20,666 -- 00:12:22,457 Now it drinks little water 88 00:12:22,666 -- 00:12:25,082 and its digestive system can extract moisture 89 00:12:25,291 -- 00:12:29,790 and nutrients from leaves that would be toxic to most other mammals 90 00:12:33,541 -- 00:12:39,457 Koalas use as little energy as possible resting about 19 hours a day 91 00:12:44,375 -- 00:12:48,957 Some members of the family however are active at any hour 92 00:12:49,166 -- 00:12:53,874 When moving from tree to tree they normally descend backwards 93 00:12:56,500 -- 00:13:02,624 Consejuently tree top traffic jams can sometimes leave one out on a limb 94 00:13:38,166 -- 00:13:43,749 For years on end much of the Australian inland receives little or no rain 95 00:13:43,958 -- 00:13:48,707 Two thirds is classified arid and one half is desert 96 00:13:49,166 -- 00:13:54,082 The Outback as it is called covers most of the continent 97 00:14:00,541 -- 00:14:03,582 By rights nothing should live here 98 00:14:03,791 -- 00:14:06,707 this ought to be a lifeless wasteland 99 00:14:06,916 -- 00:14:08,999 But it is not 100 00:14:10,333 -- 00:14:14,582 The closer we look the more we find that some of Australia's forest inhabitants 101 00:14:14,791 -- 00:14:19,499 have met the desert's challenge with subtlety and resource 102 00:14:21,916 -- 00:14:27,082 Now a diverse underworld of ants rodents marsupials and reptiles 103 00:14:27,291 -- 00:14:31,415 are among the most successful desert dwellers on Earth 104 00:14:32,666 -- 00:14:38,332 By day most life in this land ocean is hidden beneath the surface 105 00:14:47,958 -- 00:14:52,540 Many of the desert animals come out to feed in the cool of night 106 00:14:52,750 -- 00:14:57,124 These tiny hopping mice survive because they rarely need to drink 107 00:14:57,333 -- 00:15:02,790 Most of the water they require is contained in the seeds they eat 108 00:15:06,875 -- 00:15:10,249 ln the heat of the day they huddle together in deep burrows 109 00:15:10,458 -- 00:15:15,249 creating a humid atmosphere that helps to conserve moisture 110 00:15:25,125 -- 00:15:27,957 ln this arid region hardy mulga trees 111 00:15:28,166 -- 00:15:33,332 provide food for one of Australia's four thousand species of ants 112 00:15:43,041 -- 00:15:44,665 Six feet below the surface 113 00:15:44,875 -- 00:15:51,207 honey ants hang like clusters of golden grapes in cool humid larder chambers 114 00:15:51,458 -- 00:15:55,874 These specialised ants are living honey pots 115 00:16:02,166 -- 00:16:05,124 They are force fed by worker ants on nectar 116 00:16:05,333 -- 00:16:09,040 harvested from the sap of mulga trees growing above 117 00:16:10,208 -- 00:16:11,499 When food is scarce 118 00:16:11,708 -- 00:16:17,457 these honey pots feed the workers by regurgitating their nectar on demand 119 00:16:21,041 -- 00:16:26,707 Their underground storehouse will see the whole colony through the toughest of times 120 00:16:42,166 -- 00:16:45,874 Arid Australia is the land of the lizards 121 00:16:46,083 -- 00:16:50,749 There can be up to forty seven different varieties in just one area 122 00:16:52,875 -- 00:16:57,832 The Thorny Devil has a sticky tongue and it's picky about what it eats 123 00:17:00,958 -- 00:17:05,832 Out here black ants are one food that never runs out 124 00:17:24,625 -- 00:17:26,999 The devil is perfectly adapted to the desert 125 00:17:27,208 -- 00:17:30,290 lts prickly skin collects moisture from the air 126 00:17:30,500 -- 00:17:32,790 and a system of fine channels along its body 127 00:17:33,000 -- 00:17:35,957 carries the water to its mouth 128 00:17:54,041 -- 00:17:58,207 The biggest and most fearsome of the desert lizards is the perentie 129 00:17:58,416 -- 00:18:01,707 which is both scavenger and predator 130 00:18:02,583 -- 00:18:07,582 This lizard can exceed six feet in length and outrun a human 131 00:18:08,791 -- 00:18:12,165 lt hunts anything including the most aggressive 132 00:18:12,375 -- 00:18:16,457 and deadly of Australia's many snakes the King Brown 133 00:18:31,916 -- 00:18:36,707 Sometimes though the King Brown is more than even a perentie can manage 134 00:18:52,291 -- 00:18:56,457 The venom from this snake's bite will kill a human in minutes 135 00:18:57,208 -- 00:19:00,415 Luckily for the perentie it is immune 136 00:19:19,125 -- 00:19:23,040 While much of Australia's life was adapting to the dry inland 137 00:19:23,250 -- 00:19:28,874 some of its plants and animals retreated to the mountains of the east coast 138 00:19:40,916 -- 00:19:43,082 Here moist valleys and cool peaks 139 00:19:43,291 -- 00:19:48,290 provide a haven for Australia's living links with the past 140 00:20:00,583 -- 00:20:03,499 ln scattered pockets of primitive rainforest 141 00:20:03,708 -- 00:20:08,749 descendants of Gondwana's original plants and animals thrive today 142 00:20:18,083 -- 00:20:22,957 These Antarctic Beech trees began growing between 3 and 5 thousand years ago 143 00:20:23,166 -- 00:20:27,749 but their roots are in the ancient super continent 144 00:20:48,541 -- 00:20:50,915 Most of Australia's native plants and animals 145 00:20:51,125 -- 00:20:55,790 began to evolve in wet cool forests like these 146 00:21:01,916 -- 00:21:05,665 One of the most remarkable living links with that ancient world 147 00:21:05,875 -- 00:21:10,915 is found in the creeks and freshwater rivers of the east coast 148 00:21:23,416 -- 00:21:26,457 The Platypus suckles its young like a mammal 149 00:21:26,666 -- 00:21:29,499 yet lays egg like a lizard 150 00:21:33,083 -- 00:21:34,999 lt hunts under water with its eyes shut 151 00:21:35,208 -- 00:21:39,040 using electric sensors in its bill 152 00:21:39,375 -- 00:21:42,082 The first Europeans to see it were dumbfounded 153 00:21:42,291 -- 00:21:47,499 To them it was a living contradiction if not a practical joke 154 00:21:48,416 -- 00:21:53,249 The Platypus though has survived for 120 million years 155 00:21:53,458 -- 00:21:57,165 Today it exists nowhere else on earth 156 00:22:10,666 -- 00:22:13,290 The nearest surviving relative of the Platypus 157 00:22:13,500 -- 00:22:15,999 is the Echidna 158 00:22:17,166 -- 00:22:20,249 With its tubular snout and long sticky tongue 159 00:22:20,458 -- 00:22:23,790 it lives on ants and termites 160 00:22:27,291 -- 00:22:30,624 Unlike the Platypus the Echidna moved out of the cool forests 161 00:22:30,833 -- 00:22:34,332 and now ranges across the whole continent 162 00:22:39,416 -- 00:22:41,582 When threatened it digs in rapidly 163 00:22:41,791 -- 00:22:46,249 presenting an array of sharp spines to its attacker 164 00:23:07,083 -- 00:23:08,124 Drought 165 00:23:08,333 -- 00:23:11,582 lt can last for months or years at a time 166 00:23:12,000 -- 00:23:16,624 Long periods without rain push all life to the limit 167 00:23:29,041 -- 00:23:32,874 The young and the old are first to feel the effects 168 00:23:36,916 -- 00:23:42,457 Clear skies parched earth and searing heat become the rule of life 169 00:23:43,958 -- 00:23:47,665 Some will perish before the next rains come 170 00:23:56,333 -- 00:23:58,207 Now the kangaroos of the desert 171 00:23:58,416 -- 00:24:02,624 call on another remarkable strategy for survival 172 00:24:07,250 -- 00:24:10,874 The female can halt the growth of her developing embryo 173 00:24:11,083 -- 00:24:15,499 keeping it in a state of suspension until conditions improve 174 00:24:15,708 -- 00:24:18,957 Only then will she give birth 175 00:24:24,291 -- 00:24:29,249 For the joey already born the future is now uncertain 176 00:24:31,291 -- 00:24:36,165 But the unborn embryo will be ready when good times return 177 00:24:43,583 -- 00:24:48,124 Surviving kangaroos will either move to new territory in search of food 178 00:24:48,333 -- 00:24:54,374 or batten down near remaining waterholes while at least some grass remains 179 00:25:09,791 -- 00:25:13,457 Emu families have a similar hard choice to make 180 00:25:13,666 -- 00:25:17,415 Whatever they decide it will be a gamble 181 00:25:40,791 -- 00:25:43,082 Relief from drought is unpredictable 182 00:25:43,291 -- 00:25:47,332 and often arrives a long way from where it is needed 183 00:25:47,958 -- 00:25:50,415 Each year the tropical wet season brings storms 184 00:25:50,625 -- 00:25:53,999 and flooding to Australia's far north 185 00:25:57,208 -- 00:26:03,457 As the monsoon unfurls curtains of rain a transformation begins 186 00:26:37,166 -- 00:26:41,790 As the wetlands fill crocodiles emerge from scattered waterholes 187 00:26:42,000 -- 00:26:45,832 where they've been confined during the dry season 188 00:26:46,083 -- 00:26:48,582 They will build nests above the high water level 189 00:26:48,791 -- 00:26:51,707 and lay up to 100 eggs 190 00:26:59,875 -- 00:27:05,790 Vast networks of wetlands that have been dry since last season are flooded again 191 00:27:24,916 -- 00:27:31,040 Sometimes this powerful event can also transform Australia's arid centre 192 00:27:34,708 -- 00:27:38,165 ln years when rains are heavier and more widespread than usual 193 00:27:38,375 -- 00:27:42,707 the water flows inland to the parched interior 194 00:28:04,458 -- 00:28:08,457 Slowly heading south water spreads across the plains 195 00:28:08,666 -- 00:28:13,499 ln six months or more it may reach the centre of the continent 196 00:28:48,541 -- 00:28:52,415 Under cloudless skies the water creeps quietly inland 197 00:28:52,625 -- 00:28:55,957 filling hundreds of dry waterways 198 00:29:14,125 -- 00:29:18,749 ln dry sandy creek beds millions of tiny drought resistant eggs 199 00:29:18,958 -- 00:29:21,624 like seeds are waiting 200 00:29:28,333 -- 00:29:33,249 Subterranean life that may have been dormant for years begins to stir 201 00:29:42,666 -- 00:29:44,332 Stimulated by seeping water 202 00:29:44,541 -- 00:29:48,749 the burrowing frog awakes from its long sleep 203 00:29:50,958 -- 00:29:55,457 Carefully it parts the membrane that has kept it moist through the drought 204 00:30:03,666 -- 00:30:06,749 Like the frog many creatures are primed 205 00:30:06,958 -- 00:30:10,082 for the good times that are about to unfold 206 00:30:13,291 -- 00:30:15,832 Alerted by an ancient program in their minds 207 00:30:16,041 -- 00:30:19,332 Egrets arrive and take up feeding positions 208 00:30:19,541 -- 00:30:23,874 Fish have already started reproducing in streams that until a week ago 209 00:30:24,083 -- 00:30:26,957 were tracks of dry sand 210 00:30:46,416 -- 00:30:50,415 Thousands of waterbirds join in a frenzy of feeding and breeding 211 00:30:50,625 -- 00:30:54,332 that may happen only once or twice in a decade 212 00:31:36,458 -- 00:31:41,499 Briefly the desert blossoms in a colourful tide of new life 213 00:31:54,833 -- 00:32:00,582 One of the few large predators in this land also participates in the bonanza 214 00:32:03,833 -- 00:32:06,040 Australia's wild dog the dingo 215 00:32:06,250 -- 00:32:10,582 arrived from nearby Asia about four thousand years ago 216 00:32:15,583 -- 00:32:19,332 lts pups will feed on the plentiful supply of rodents and reptiles 217 00:32:19,541 -- 00:32:23,499 that are also multiplying in the abundant conditions 218 00:32:47,791 -- 00:32:49,332 Tens of thousands of pelicans 219 00:32:49,541 -- 00:32:53,874 are drawn by the irresistible call of inland water 220 00:32:54,333 -- 00:32:57,374 Responding to reflections far away in the sky 221 00:32:57,583 -- 00:33:04,082 the birds fly hundreds of miles to gather on the shores of newly filled desert lakes 222 00:33:14,958 -- 00:33:17,624 With more than half a million nesting birds 223 00:33:17,833 -- 00:33:21,290 colonies of this size are a rare event 224 00:34:05,166 -- 00:34:08,332 Pelicans normally breed in small scattered communities 225 00:34:08,541 -- 00:34:11,290 producing one chick a year 226 00:34:14,958 -- 00:34:18,499 Here they'll produce five or more in quick succession 227 00:34:18,708 -- 00:34:23,707 and go on doing so as long as the food supply lasts 228 00:34:34,625 -- 00:34:36,082 Millions of years ago 229 00:34:36,291 -- 00:34:41,540 pelicans were breeding in the vast lake system that covered much of the interior 230 00:34:47,958 -- 00:34:53,540 Ancestral knowledge seems to draw them back to their primeval home range 231 00:35:18,625 -- 00:35:23,707 The water ends its longjourney at the centre of the continent in Lake Eyre 232 00:35:37,791 -- 00:35:39,707 Nearly a million square miles 233 00:35:39,916 -- 00:35:44,332 of the continent drains into the world's largest dry salt lake 234 00:35:44,541 -- 00:35:48,665 lt fills completely only about twice a century 235 00:36:26,875 -- 00:36:30,415 lnevitably the flow of water stops 236 00:36:36,416 -- 00:36:40,749 The earth and blasting sun suck away at the stagnant pools where life 237 00:36:40,958 -- 00:36:44,665 newly born there is on borrowed time 238 00:36:54,166 -- 00:36:55,832 Trapped by receding waters 239 00:36:56,041 -- 00:37:00,457 some of these fish will provide a final feast for the birds 240 00:37:05,833 -- 00:37:09,249 Millions more will return to the mud of the riverbed 241 00:37:09,458 -- 00:37:12,582 enriching it for the next generation 242 00:37:24,333 -- 00:37:26,040 With their food supply running low 243 00:37:26,250 -- 00:37:29,915 the great flocks of pelicans become nomads once more 244 00:37:30,125 -- 00:37:35,124 rising to search for that far flash of water over the horizon 245 00:37:40,625 -- 00:37:44,790 Those who have left their run too late go back into the earth 246 00:37:59,333 -- 00:38:02,749 The familiar desert will now reclaim this place 247 00:38:02,958 -- 00:38:06,915 Suns will scorch it winds will dry it out 248 00:38:14,833 -- 00:38:19,249 Most living creatures will dig in and take refuge underground 249 00:38:19,458 -- 00:38:23,499 Some will flee to the gentler edges of this great land 250 00:38:23,708 -- 00:38:28,665 And the hardy ones will await a new flood in some future year 251 00:38:42,500 -- 00:38:47,707 ln Australia life has struck an unlikely deal with an uncertain climate 252 00:38:54,250 -- 00:38:56,624 The continent has been a ship of refuge 253 00:38:56,833 -- 00:38:59,374 for an alternate order of ancient life 254 00:38:59,583 -- 00:39:01,874 as it crept northward through the eons 255 00:39:02,083 -- 00:39:06,040 its passengers have had to adapt again and again 256 00:39:20,833 -- 00:39:22,749 ln this land beyond time 257 00:39:22,958 -- 00:39:28,165 life has learned to ride out the hard times and flourish in the good times 258 00:39:28,375 -- 00:00:00,-001 Far more than merely surviving life has triumphed in Australia
