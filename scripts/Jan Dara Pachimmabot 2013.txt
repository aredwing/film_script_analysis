It is old age but we still have a long story. Do you remember our story, Ken? Ken, we send it to the village. We like just expelled. In a place where we felt in exile. I still remember that time, Chan. We both felt free. And it's a story that is not forgotten. We send it to a far-flung village. Must use a boat to get there. And when it arrives I felt very strange at all. Are you Chan? Mistress is waiting for you. Alright. Are you Chan? Are you Chan? I'm very pleased. Are you surprised I'm old? Not too. Although I am old, I still remember everything. And I also have all of your pictures. Are you Chan? You know the story about me? Meyakitkan and very sad. Filled with suffering. Can not be expressed in words. Used here is often held performances. The story of the king and queen. Very touching and romantic. We are all fascinated by the role. Starring his very handsome man. And I start my story with him. A very manly at all. But in the end ... Very painful and regret. You have no shame! How dare you do that! I beg you. Please, you let this once. I want to explain all that happened here. No need to. Do not you want to know? Everything was clear. You already can not forgive. I want you to get out of here. And do not ever come back again. You're cruel. Doing all of this. What next? Do you really go from there? And leave him? I've been kicked out. There is no chance anymore. I start everything from scratch. Everything from the starting point. It all depends on me now. And then I found a place. A very peaceful place. And that makes me comfortable. Here, I found peace. I end here with Ken. In this remote place. Very quiet and peaceful here once. You do not need khawartir with me. I'm fine here. I remember when I had to part with you. It pains me, but I had to do it. To avoid pertengkaranku with Dad. It makes me have to part with you. Here a lot of servants. And a lot of activities as well. With that we both live everything. And I feel at peace here. While Ken, every day having fun. Joked with the maid. And the servants also entertain him. I want you to be patient to wait. I'll be home soon. And we will be together again. Jan Dara. Chan, why did you this? No nothing, Ken. Just being felt all this. You're lying, Chan. You always say that. Listen, Chan. I've got a great idea. Let's go have fun in the city. What do you want? Do not want. Why do not you like? Ken Chan wanted to entertain. So you do not like this pensive. Now, Chan. What would join Ken? Ken would like to ask you to have fun. You go. Good evening, may I help you? You can choose as you please. There are skinny, fat, tall, short. - How much is it? - Not expensive, man. With little money You can feel satisfaction. You do not need to worry, all very good ministry. What about it? Do you often come here? No. What you first came here? True, I first came here. Are you going to come here again? it depends on your service if satisfactory I will come again. You'll see. So many men are saying things like that. But I'm not that kind of guy. I'm a faithful. Faithful like what? It's easy to say the word faithful. but in reality ... Why do you say that? Back before I was here, I never felt a violent. Happened when I was in the woods. I had been obstructed by a group of people. And I can not do anything. I am at the abducted persons. And the servants also taken. And I was raped by them. Every night. Every night another man. And there was a man who helped me. He is also very loyal. I do not know what I'm feeling right now. Ken suddenly return with haste. And when he arrived at the house, he wanted to tell me something. Though I had gone to bed. But still he woke me up. And told me about her experience that night. With the woman. Then me and him immediately conduct an investigation. But we did not find any. You are sure of that story, Ken? Chan, have I ever lied to you? Looks like he also said ... something else. Oh, I remember there was something she said. All events the last 10 years here. What is your purpose? To find out what about it? It does not concern you, for what bother? Actually nothing to do with me. What to do with you? I want to find out the origin suggested. Actually ... We all also want to know the origin of our rafters. Then we place down The officer said that. Far away from the city center, and we had to walk along the river. To get there. And I hope, one thing. I could find I'm looking for answers. This they want to ask something. Can you help them? What do you want to ask? You want to know about? Sorry. I beg you to let me know. It has to do with my mother and origin suggested. I'm begging you. To tell them everything. What happened at that time. I beg of you. I'll tell you, Chan. At that time ... I'm very happy. At that time I was young and rich. No one can touch me. Everything wants to be friends with. No exception to the police and officials. I'm very familiar with them. Every day I always have fun. Are accompanied with my friends. And there is a policeman who is very close to me. On one day, he met a woman. Beauty as an angel. He instantly fell in love. And at that moment he promised in its own right. I must have this woman whatever happens. And it turns out his love too received by the woman. And finally ... The woman kidnapped by group of people. And do not know where it was taken. Not heard the news about him anymore. Until one day ... He investigated the carrying troops. Finding their hideout. And she found her hero. With a sad state. And finally she told me everything. What happened to him and others. And what they do. Tells us that she was raped many times. Day and night with the men. I'm very pleased. Finally you can go back to my arms. Whatever happens, forget it. From now on, we will begin a new chapter. No need to remember the past again. We can start from scratch. But what about me? Not a problem. I will forget everything. I was dirty. I feel not worthy anymore. I do not want to be like this. Chan ... Will you accept me? Although what happened to me. I receive you. And on that night, on their first night. One thing happens. Those that do will be in the firing squad. Because there is no mercy for them. I'm here to punish you. No need, I'll handle it. It was embarrassing my family name. No need to talk anymore. You, bastard. Embarrassing! You do not know who your father. Many men who never felt the body. Illegitimate child. Chan. Chan.
