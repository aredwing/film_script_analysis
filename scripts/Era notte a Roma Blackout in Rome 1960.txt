Dad, the sisters are here! Make yourselves comfortable. - What a chill! - North wind. Come in and warm yourselves. Thank you. That's better! Lovely and warm. What have you got for us, then? - A bit of flour. - And some beans. And oil? We can get hold of a few litres. For mow much? 1,000? - How do you expect us to pay that much? - Let's go. This is no good to us. - Goodbye. - Good day to you. Ah, well, goodbye. I'm sorry, but at these prices there's nothing we can do. Just a minute... perhaps we can come to an agreement. In the name of religion... How much did we say for the flour? - 15. - The oil? - 500, OK? We can't. We'll do as you wish, but you have to help us in return. We've got ourselves into some trouble. I want to talk to you. Sit down, make yourselves comfortable. Come and sit by the fire. Warm yourselves up. We've got ourselves into some trouble. I have to confess to you that we've hidden three prisoners of war in the house. They got here a month ago. One of them is injured as well. With all the evacuees that have arrived we've had to hide them and who can you trust? It means I can't rent out the house. You have to get rid of them for us. Take them on the truck with you, and leave them by the road somewhere. You have to help us. You can name your price for the food if you take them away but you must help us. - Salt at 1 00 lire? - What do you mean 1 00 lire? You should give it to us for nothing with the risk we'd be taking. If something goes wrong, what will happen to our poor orphans? Yes, those poor children. - Where are these prisoners, then? - They're hidden nearby. Shut the door. Shut it, shut the door. Are they all English, then? One of them is. One is American, he's got an injured knee. And what about the other one? The other one... You need to get them on the truck and take them away. We won't be able to, they're too big. They won't fit. We can't do it. No, it's too risky. - We have to think of our poor orphans. - That's right. We can't do it. Listen, is that ham you've got fresh? What do you mean? It's two years old. - It looked like it was all fat to me. - What about wine, have you got that? We've got some special wine. How much are the wine and ham together? You have to take the prisoners away. - All right, you said that one is English. - The other is American. - But who's the third one? - He's Russian, sister. Russian? Ham, wine, you can have what you want if you take the prisoners away. Do you think we're going to sell ourselves? If we help you, we're doing it for the love of God. - Come on, let's get a move on. - Yes. Let's get to the truck. Don't forget that wine. Come on. Here. Let's go, hurry. Quick, come on. Come on. Are you mad? Get down! Cover him! Hurry up, get in! There. Right... Where's the wine?! - I've got it here. - Well, get it, then. Yes, yes. Cover him up. Hide him. Hurry up! You're so slow! Quickly, come on. There we are. Pull it up. Make sure he's covered. Come on, let's go. Will you let me that room? I can give you 3,000 lire. Stop then, and we'll let them out. Wait till we get to the top, otherwise we'll get stuck. All right. When's he going to stop? What's going on now? How do I know? - Can you give him a lift? He's broken down. - The Germans! - OK, get in. - Thanks. Excuse me, sister, could I get in? Have a seat at the front. Hurry, Father, it'll be dark soon! You may pass. - Excuse me, sisters. - On you go. On you go! - Sister, sister, my bag! - Here you go. Thank you. Get down, hide yourselves. Give me a push, then. - Let's go! - Come on, push! Will you give me a hand lifting these planks? Right, move yourselves. Keep out of sight. Pass me that ham. Who's eating it now? I'll put it away. The ham and wine are mine, I got them. If I waited for you to see to it... The saIt's mine, then. Fine. - Nice associations we've been making. - What associations? - Associations with bullies. - Ah, I see. - I can tell you. - Too right. - Come on, quick. - The lengths we've been to. - Do you think we've been sleeping? - What's the point to go? Is that what you reckon? Good to know. Let's go, quick. Guess what the news is. We'll leave the wine, the ham and this. You're right, we're best off out of the way. We'll leave the prisoners to her. - See you, good luck! - Goodbye, boys. Come on, hurry! - Have they gone? - Yes. The swines. What do we do now, then? All right, get your stuff. Come with me. Quickly. Get all of it. Idiots, they've left the lights on. The battery will end up flat. Are you ready? Let's go, quick. This ham... Be careful. This is us. Put it down. Down! Take this. There. Just a minute, I'll open the door. There. Pick it up. In you go, quick. Put it down here. Careful. You haven't shut the door! Do you live in the Colosseum? Quiet. Careful. Take him through there. Through there, in the bedroom. That's right, take him through and he can lie down. Put him down here. For now, I mean, you'll be upstairs after that. He needs medicine. If he's got a fever what do we do? We could give him some aspirin? There you go. It should be in here. Here it is. The iodine. OK. What's up with him? What happened? What are you on about? I don't understand. Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. Here, take that. I'm going to go through there, I'm squeamish. Do you want something to eat? I'll make you some spaghetti with garlic and oil. Boys, listen... I trust you... A bit of respect... No messing about. Do we understand each other? Good. There. Ah, sorry. Did you like it? How was it, nice? Yes? I'm starving. Thanks. That's fine. Sister... Mis... Where... we... stay? Here. But... where? Excuse me a minute. Esperia! What have you been doing until this time? You know I've been out. I know, but why are you up so late? - I'll tell you later. - No, tell me now. I'm coming up. - Are you mad? What about the curfew? - So? So nothing. I'm tired and freezing cold. I'm off to bed. - I'm coming up. - 'Night. Turn that light off! If he comes up... You'll have to go up to the attic. You...up... I'll come with you. We'll take him up too. We need to hurry. No, not that way. This way. In here. Can you give me a hand? Let's go up. Up you come. For now you can make yourselves at home up here. Go over there. It's warm up here in the attic, eh? This is a chimney. Can you feel how nice and warm it is? It's full of rats up here. They've invaded us as well. If you see any, kill them. They don't even go into the traps any more. These are candles. Candles. Got it? Do you want a packet of cigarettes? Yes? - Thanks. - Make yourselves comfortable. Good night. Tomorrow you have to clear off. I'm sorry, but you'll have to clear off. Understand? Good night. Who is it? Who is it? Excuse me. I...would like... Don't get any closer or I'll kill you! I want... - tea. - Don't be stupid. - Tea! - What "te"?! What? Water? Water. - Hot. - I see. Stupid. Does he think it grows on trees? We work hard here, you know. I can't help, then. I'm sorry. Come here, you. - So, do you want the flour? - Yes, at 25 lire though. - Yes, at 25. - I'll take two kilos then. - I haven't got it here. - I'm counting on it. I've work to do, I'll get it before midday. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Listen, go and call the doctor, tell him I'll be waiting for him at home. Are you unwell? No, I'm fine. Tell him I'm waiting and that the stuff's arrived. - Hurry. - OK. Esperia, what have you done with the soldiers from last night? Nothing. Do you know what the lawyer said? Anyone the Germans find hiding an Allied prisoner will be shot. - Really? - You need to get rid of them straight away. I sent them on their way last night, what did you think I'd done? You've nothing to worry about, then. I've got things to do, I'll see you later. Where's Renato? I need to talk to him urgently. Go and call Renato. Esperia, how are things? How do you think? Everything round here's a mess. - Rena'... - What is it? You have to come home, I need your help. - I can't be seen about the place. - Everyone here is on our side. Yes, cover your face with your scarf. Let's go. Renato, how are you doing? - Here he is. Hello, Esperia. - Hello. I've not seen you in ages, I thought you were serving. No...I'm not serving. Bye. Look at them, on the terrace! What will happen if they're seen? - Were they here last night when I whistled? - Yes. Come on, tell them what I told you. They won't understand me. Make yourself understood! Come on. She says that you can't stay, - that you have to go. - Yes. - I don't understand. - He must understand! There's an injured American as well. This one's English, the other's Russian. - Which one's Russian? - That one. You idiot, what do you mean "tovarich"? You have to send them away. Come on! She says she is frightened, that if you stay here she'll be shot. Understand? Me! Yes, her. - Leave? - Yes, you have to go! Oh, God. For goodness' sake don't talk. Hide. Go through there. Don't talk. Ah, it's you, Doctor. You have to help me. It's the doctor! - The door. - Doctor, come through. Esperia took three prisoners last night. - Well, she found them in Cerveteri. - Look at this idiot laughing! Never! Good work, Esperia. Hush, hush, eh? Never mind that, if they're found I'll be shot, got it? Come through. He's the doctor. Hello. - Excuse us? - Go on up. - They have to go. - Oh, yes. Where are we going? My mother made the hole so you could get up to the attic. You can explain at last, Doctor. Can you tell them they must go? I didn't know that having them here I risked being executed. Don't worry, I'll tell them. Doctor, have you told them they have to go? Yes, yes, I've told them. Come on, Esperia, behave. Let me work in peace, will you? Try to get hold of these medicines. They're sulphanilamides. It shouldn't be hard for someone involved with the black market to get them. OK. And then will they go? Of course. They'll go straight away. You'd hardly want to kick them out in this state. - But when will he be better? - Soon. The sooner you bring the medicine, the sooner they can go. How's it going? Have you sold anything? Espe', when are you bringing the oil? Here, Doctor. It's all I could find. So? - "So" what? - Well... As soon as he's better he'll go, along with the others. I'll see to him now. He has to go downstairs and this place needs to be cleaned. Boil some water in a big pan for at least five minutes. Hurry. But... But, Doctor, they can't stay here... Right... Rena', they have to go. They have to go now, understand?! Knock it off! Come on. Be quiet, be quiet. Come on and we'll boil the water. But they can't stay here anymore! Leave me alone. You've all tricked me. You've all tricked me! Come on, stop it. They'll go, Espe', you'll see. - No, they'll stay here. - No they won't. Just the usual. This morning when she went out she didn't know. It's already gone 7. They'll end up inside, her and the other two. I've told them a thousand times to stop this caper of dressing up as nuns. - One of these days they'll get arrested. - Nuns don't get arrested. You think it's funny, Doctor? Don't worry, women always escape unscathed. Especially if they're pretty and what's more dressed as nuns. Right, but how do they go about it? Good evening to you all. - Ah, the doctor's here too. - At last. We were worried. I can see. Look what I've brought. No, I'm scared, I can't. What are you scared for? Turkey. No, I'm scared. How did you manage to get back after curfew? We met a very kind German official. Kind or lecherous? How vulgar you are. That's the last time I go outside Rome. Your friends at Santa Marinella fired their machine guns at us. You lot always say "sorry". I'm not fighting with those peasants any more. They've become like hyenas. Do you know how much they wanted for a ham? Oh, God, the alarm. I'm going to the shelter... I can't, dressed like this. - I'm off to get changed. - Let's go. Stay here, idiot. Take no notice, we're mad. What are you doing? Aren't you coming? Hurry up! - Aren't you coming, Doctor? - No, I'm staying. We're having a game of cards. - And what about you, are you staying? - Yes. Of course, you have to play the hero. You're all mad. - I'm going out, the major is coming with me. - Where? - Down to our place. - To... Yes. I'll come too. Let's go. Comrade... It's raining, it's cold. The "tovarich" is coming too, Doctor. OK. Hello. - How are the detonators coming on? - Badly. They're always playing up. It's over. Let's go. Let's go, Fyodor. - Goodbye, Fyodor. I'm staying here. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Doctor. - Bye. Be careful, won't you? Where are the others? - Where are they? - I don't know. Away. I don't know. But have they gone out? I'm fed up of this! Completely fed up! - Who is it? - It's me. - Do you want to get me sent to prison? - I wanted to see the river. You should have thrown yourselves in, the lot of you. I've had enough! Do you understand? Just think, if someone saw you... They're bound to have seen you and heard you. - The porter's always there, spying. - No one saw us, don't worry. And I'm fed up of you always being here! Everyone knows we're engaged. That means you can stay, does it? What will people think? What do you care what people think? I care a great deal! You're thinking of that with everything that's going on in? Oh, yes, since we're in the middle of all this a girl has to become a whore. Come on, what's that got to do with it? A girl should have a wider view. You can't see anything from here. Off you go, it's late and I'm tired. - Go on. - You're happy to kick me out now? You don't care if they see me? If the patrol... What patrol? Where are you going? Wait. You said I had to go. Off you go now. No one knows what's going on any more. No one even knows who's in charge. The Fascists say one thing, the Germans something else, the police yet another and we're always stuck in the middle. We've had enough. The party secretary says suppress the black market. The Germans, who are more cunning, say to leave it. We're between the devil and the deep blue sea. In the meantime children are going hungry. And my wife, as you know, gave birth two weeks ago. I know, you said last time too. That's why I kept that powdered milk to one side. The turkey's escaped! Oh God! Oh God, I don't feel well. Espe', the milk! It's OK. What have you been up to? I can't take any more of this. I don't know what to do. - It's all your fault. - My fault? Yes, it was you that tricked me into it. Sit. Comrade, where are you going? He was off, did you see? Where are you going? What's happened has happened, we just have to hope for the best. I... I didn't want to send you away, you know. Come on, put this stuff down. Poor thing, I feel sorry for him. - It's you I don't feel sorry for. - There you go again. Oh, really? You were the first one to trick me! Oh, Espe'! You know what?... "You have to go! You have to go!" And then when it comes to it, they don't have to go and she blames me! These Russians! - Who is it? - It's me, Alfredo. Just give me a minute to put something on. Be careful, the porter's here. Don't move. Have you taken up mountaineering? It's months since I've been up here. You've got a fine view up here, you know. Well, yes, no complaints about that. Do you want a drop of wine? Then you can tell me if you like it. It's nice. It's Cannellino di Grottaferrata. If you want a few bottles... Wine's bad for you on an empty stomach. With the rations we get we can't even feed the children. I see. Tell your wife that if she needs something I'm here. "Needs"! We could do with a lot of things. But we haven't got the money. Take this chocolate for the children. You're too kind. I don't know how to thank you. Don't be silly. If we don't share what we've got... But that lot have to leave immediately. Until now I've turned a blind eye, both in fact. But if they don't go, I'm obliged to do something about it. I know, of course. The others in the building have kept quiet as well. But after what happened this morning... Do you understand? - Of course I understand. - Well, then. Don't worry, they'll go. Listen, you haven't got a bit of Parmesan, have you? I'm sorry, Signor Alfredo, I haven't got any at all. Listen... I... I'll send them away after Christmas. No! They have to go today or tomorrow at the latest. Espe', it's not out of spite, but I've got responsibilities. All right. In a couple of days it's Christmas. How can we? Signor Alfredo, I know somewhere I can get hold of Parmesan. I'll get you some in time for Christmas. OK? We can do as you say, see what happens. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Is everything ready? - Shall I go and call Esperia? - Yes. - Come on. - Wait... It's lovely. - It looks like a ballroom! - There's even an orchestra. Thank you. It's all lovely. These are for you. Thank you. No, nothing for you. Don't mess about. You... It's silly, but with love. Thank you. I mended this for you. Thank you, Peter. We need a toast! There. To Russia... Here. America... and England. And to Rome, eh? Take... Who's going to sing? You are. I have to sing because I'm ltalian? Let's hear it, come on. All right, I'm tone deaf. Let's sit down while the pasta cooks. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers, everyone. - Cheers. Never able... express... feelings to you. I know much little of you... and you to know me little. My country... far... You not know my country. I suffer. I'm far from my country, from my family. Dear, good... and beautiful, Esperia. And you, my dear ltalian friend, "tovarich" Renato. Thank you. I'm sorry. To our good health. The pasta's still on the stove, it'll overcook! It's time to go. Get your stuff. Quick. Hurry. Hurry. We'll wait for you downstairs. Watch out! Hurry! On you go. Dante and Remo. When? This morning at dawn, we were told. - Rena', what's happened? - Nothing. Of course. You'll see, they'll go. What can we do? One day either way isn't the point. Let's hope God helps us. He always has until now. We'll find a way of getting you back up. Let's hope no one notices. You can stay. So, what is it you and Giacinto have been up to? It's just Giacinto and his obsession with inventing... You think I haven't seen that they're bombs? Are you mad? What are you on about? Don't you trust me? What's that got to do with it? Of course I do, but... Look, I'm not trying to tell you off, even if what you're doing is dangerous. Even if I'm frightened for you. Now that I know what you're doing, I'm happy. Not happy, exactly, try to understand. I said to myself, "Renato is better than I thought. "At least he's got an idea, a goal." I don't know if what you're doing is right or wrong. Who knows what's right or wrong these days? But I have faith in you. If you do something, it's because it's right. And l... I care about you. Damn it, I can't even explain what I mean! You've explained perfectly. I care about you too. Renato... Come on, let's go. Let's go. Renato, can I stay here? Work. - Espe'... - What is it? He wants to stay here and work. Giaci'... Are you sure you want to stay here? Well...goodbye. Bye. How can we? We can't hide more than one. Do you know these? Come on. Quietly. Be careful, darling, go straight home. Can't I come up? No, behave yourself. Why not? Now that those wretches have gone and you're alone... Let me come up. Thank goodness they have. Signor Alfredo was right, it was a burden for everyone. So, let's go up then. No, darling, I'm really tired this evening. Why not? Come on, Esperia. I can't. Maybe tomorrow, eh? Well, OK then, tomorrow. - Good night. - 'Night. I'm just going to the workshop, I'll find something for him to sleep on. Yes. - We're sorry. - Come on, what do you mean? What for? But thank you. - Happy Christmas. - Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas. Thank you. I'm going. Why don't you stay for a bit? Stay here. OK. - What time is it? - Nearly 7, hurry. I'm ready, I expected you earlier. I've been listening to the radio. They said they've killed Ciano and the others. Justice has been done, they said. Hitler wants them all dead. So? They're killing one-another. I'm coming too. We'll bring something to drink, some wine. - Give it to me, then. - It's downstairs. Hurry, it's almost the curfew. - OK, we'll tell them and then go. - Come on. Boys, we're going downstairs to take the Russian something to eat. Then I'll come straight back up and make something for you. Learning ltalian keeps me warm. Good. God, it's freezing. The wind's coming in all over the place. Couldn't you have wrapped up? - Hurry, the curfew, it's late! - Just a minute. We'll be right back. Don't make a sound. Take them away! Move it! You've killed him! - Move it! - Murderers! You've killed him! It went well, Tarci'. Hello? It's Princess Antoniani. Could you put me through to the lobby, please? Hello? Yes, just a moment, I'll call him. Your Highness, a telephone call for you. Hello? Ah, it's you. What's happening? Nothing, why? Ah, yes, yes. Yes, I know. It will be the usual alarmist voices. Don't worry, keep calm. And don't phone me, OK? Listen, Alessandro, I was forgetting to say that those two friends of Augusto's are here. What do you mean, which friends? The ones that had to do with the turkey. Keep calm, they won't be staying long. At least, it doesn't look like it. Yes. I'll expect you soon. Bye. The Allies have landed at Anzio. Baron von Kleist. Good evening. Dear Baron, how are you? Fine, thank you. Good evening. Good evening Rudy. I wasn't expecting you so soon. You know everyone, don't you? Of course, my dear Elena. Charming to see you, Princess. Vincenzo, would you tell Don Augusto Baron von Kleist is here? I've been taking care of your protegee. - Esperia Belli. - Ah, yes. I've been talking to the captain in charge of the inquest. He's been very kind. He's assured me that in a few days - unless complications such as further landings occur - she will be freed, it seems she wasn't involved in her fiance's activities. - So much the better. - You were running a significant risk. If the workshop had gone up, the building could have been blown to pieces. Let's not exaggerate, dear Baron. This house was built using travertine from the Colosseum. Who was it that wrote, "When falls the Colosseum, Rome shall fall; - "And when Rome falls... - "The World". They're the words of Shelley. Of course, Byron, how foolish of me! A little ice. Thank you. Did you say Byron? No, it was me. So there's no hope of the other two being released? Elena, dear, it's out of the question. They were caught red-handed, manufacturing explosive devices. They had a Russian with them as well. I can assure you, however, that they will be tried fairly. That's one thing, at least. What can you tell us about the landing, Baron? The matter is no longer of any interest but the 48 previous hours were very exciting. Now we are certain of being able to repel any enemy manoeuvre. Here is today's bulletin from the supreme command of the Reich's armed forces. The headquarters of the Fuhrer communicates the following. The quick reaction of the German armed forces has foiled the attempted Allied landing at Anzio. Squadrons of Stuka and bombers have attacked Anglo-American naval forces. The Germans! The Germans are here. You come with me. Take them up to the terrace immediately. You two, come with me. Quickly. - The lieutenant says... - No need to explain. I know enough German to understand that much. And what's your response? Nothing. Firstly because no question has been addressed to me. And also because I don't recognise any right to do so. Excuse me. The lieutenant apologises for the ambiguity and is prepared to forgo the ordered search of the palace, provided that you give me your word that the persons he is looking for are not on the premises. My word of honour? Tell him he can look wherever he likes. We're going to take a drink. Will you join us, Baron? Off we go. You two come with me, quick. Erica, you stay here. You come with me. - Let's go then. - I'll wait for Augusto. - This way, Professor. - Thank you. - Good evening, Father. - Good evening. This way. Father, these are friends of Prince Antoniani's. Welcome. You'll be a bit cramped but for the moment it's the best I can offer you. This way, Professor. Make yourself comfortable. - I'll be right back. - Thank you very much. Come with me. There's room for another two in here. Thank you. Please, come in. My fiancee has gone to the radio studios. She should be OK there, at least. I've heard absolutely nothing from my lot. I fled without even being able to close my shop. - You're lucky, in a way... - I'm so worried for that little boy. Let's hope it's all over soon. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Have you got the papers, Don Valerio? Any news for me? Yes. Bad news, unfortunately. There. May I have one? What else has happened, my son? There's been a bomb attack. "On the afternoon of March 23rd "Communist elements have thrown a bomb "at a column of German soldiers as they moved along Via Rasella. "32 German policemen were killed and many injured. "The German command... "..has ordered that for every German killed "ten Communists are to be shot." The order has been carried out. "The victims were sent into tuff caves dozen metres deep "with their hands fastened behind their backs. "The engines of lorries were left running "so as to drown out the cries of those being executed." - Dear Baron... - Thank you. I took the liberty of coming unannounced. You can visit as you please, you're a friend. Still? Of course. I leave tomorrow. I asked to be transferred. - They're sending me to the North. - What a shame. - Would you like some tea? - Yes, please. I managed to get the information that you asked for. It's in German, could you translate, please? - Lemon? - Yes, please. "Renato Balducci and Giacinto Renzi "died on the 24th of March 1 944. "Their personal effects can be collected "from the police at Via Tasso 1 55." Look at this, vandals. Look at it. They took everything. What for? Let's go through and I'll do your accounts. Come on. Right, this is 14,263 lire. I sold your stuff for you. Here are all the figures. Accurate to the cent. Count it. - All right... All right... - Come on, don't do that. Come on, Espe', be brave. Come on, let's go. Come on. I can't bear to think about it. Why? Why?! Father, I'd like to confess as well. I'm sorry but I haven't time now. I'll send another priest immediately. Follow me. It's terrible, it's been truly terrible. I understand. I would like to help you. I feel absolutely powerless in here. There's nothing to be done now. How's Peter? He went south. Well... we'll meet again. We'll meet again. There's a man in there... that I don't want to see. Who? Him there. Do you see him? - What... - It's Tarcisio. What's he doing here? He used to be a priest. Hurry! Get them down here at once! Come on, move it! Reverend fathers, you must excuse our having to wake you. We are good Catholics but we haven't had the time to educate ourselves. For this reason we would like to ask you a few questions, to benefit from your education. I've brought with me a friend who understands Latin well. The lesson will be of use to us all. We're ready, sir. Who said the words, "Quid autem amo, cum te amo?" Bring in the others. A learned father such as yourself doesn't know whose words they are? Who said, "Quid autem amo, cum te amo?" Your questioning is an insult to this place and to our calling. I order... yes, I order you all not to respond. What a beautiful voice. You, take them away. Him and him. Tell me, Father, is the active intellect part of the soul? What, you don't know if the active intellect is part of the soul? Perhaps it's a case of amnesia, ask him another one. Could you tell us whether free will is or is not distinct from a man's free agency? No, he's completely lost his memory. We'll have to send him back to school. Would you mind reciting the Adoration of the Cross, Father? "My people, what have I done to you? "How have I burdened you? Answer me. "Why did I draw you from the earth? "Have you... "Have you prepared the cross "for the Lord?" "Holy God, holy mighty One, holy immortal One, have mercy on us." "Because I guided you for 40 years in the desert. "l fed you, I brought you to the Promised Land, "and made a cross for your saviour". "Holy God, holy mighty One, holy immortal One, "have mercy on us.... That's enough! Take them all away! Out! Out! Who is it? It's me. Michele. Just a moment, I'll open up. Can you help, l... My dear. You must excuse me. I spent the night in the attic. I didn't want to disturb. Last night... I escaped from San Salvatore in Lauro because...the Fascists arrived... invaded. They took... many people. I want to... tell you something. Do you remember... How do you say... The man with the limp, that you saw in church. He was there. He was asking the questions, and all that didn't know the responses to the prayers... arrested. Tarcisio. I don't know his name. The one... with the limp, whose foot... Yes. Now I see. The swine. I'm sorry. My God. But... you won't have had anything to eat, poor thing. Come here. - Who is it? - Friends. What friends? It's me, Tarcisio. What a surprise! I thought you'd forgotten about me. If only. I'm joking. I've been busy. Listen, Esperia, the Germans are removing the wounded from the hospitals. They're packing their bags at the German embassy. I'm leaving. Some friends with a car are giving me a lift to Florence. From there I'll find a way north. Do you want to come with me? - Me? - Of course. That's what I came to ask. Esperia... it's going to be the end of the world here. They'll be fighting street by street, house by house. Rome will be demolished, stone by stone, and rightly so. This city should be wiped off the face of the earth, these poor cowards, traitors, spies. You'll come with me. Let's go. We'll go to Venice, eh? I've many friends there. Important people. You'll see who I really am. I... have some money put aside. You won't want for anything. I cared about Renato, you know. I'd known him since he was a boy. I did everything I could to try and save him. I told him to stop, not to mix with those people. To watch out, that Giacinto was being watched - but he wouldn't listen... - Swine! - Don Valerio isn't there. - Where is he? They don't know. Go back and wait until he comes back. Tell him that I'm waiting at home and to come immediately. OK. Looks like the Germans are leaving, eh? Don Valerio wasn't there. The little girl's waiting for him. It looks like the Germans are going. Who is it? It's me, Don Valerio. Good evening, Father. Ah, you're here. Yes. Good evening. You wanted to see me. Yes. The man with the limp, do you remember him, Father? Tarcisio. Yes. What about him? He's dead. But...when? - This morning. - And how? - I did it. - Both of us. It was me. And what's more... he was unarmed. Look. Don Valerio, help us. We need to get rid of him. No. We need to give him a Christian burial. My God, the light's come back on. Turn it off! No... No, you don't know... You don't know. I'm one of them, I'm a spy as well. I told the Germans to come and look here. While I was standing there with Renato they beat him on the soles of his feet with a lead pipe. I told them... what he wouldn't say. I told them everything, that you were hiding here. I would rather you had been killed, if it could have saved Renato. But... that's not how it turned out. But that wasn't spying. What is it then? There's no point making excuses, Don Vale'. I'm a wretch. I disgust myself. Everything disgusts me. Everything. Oh, God. I should have told you earlier. It would have been better. Better for everyone. I can't take it any more. Your men have arrived. What's going on? Who's here? The Americans... the English, the Allies are here. I'll be back.
