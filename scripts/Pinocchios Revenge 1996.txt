OVER. ROGER, ADAM DAVID 5. STAND BY. [GRUNTING] ADAM DAVID 5, NO WANTS OR WARRANTS ON GSQ74K. CAR'S REGISTERED TO A VINCENT GOTTO. ROGER, DISPATCH. [THUNDER] DON'T MOVE! DROP THE SHOVEL! I SAID DROP THE FUCKIN' SHOVEL! NOW TURN AROUND SLOWLY. YOU DID A NICE JOB HERE. THANK YOU, SIR. IT'S A GOOD THING YOU FOUND HIM WHEN YOU DID. A COUPLE OF DAYS, THAT WATER TABLE WOULD HAVE REALLY BLOATED HIM UP. I'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE. OH, CHRIST. ANOTHER ONE? LISTEN, YOU GO BACK AND GET FORENSICS, O.K.? YES, SIR. LET'S GET IT OUT. EASY. WHAT THE HELL-- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT? WHAT THE HELL HAVE WE GOT HERE, HUH? O.K., TOMMY, ON 3. 1, 2, 3. LOCAL WOOD SCULPTOR AND CONVICTED SERIAL KILLER VINCENT GOTTO IS IN THE NEWS ONCE MORE. WITH HIS NEW EXECUTION DATE LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY, HIS ATTORNEY HAS FILED FOR A COMMUTED SENTENCE WITH THE STATE COUR OF APPEALS, AND HIS FUTURE IS BEING DECIDED NOW IN THIS VERY COURTHOUSE. UH, YOUR HONOR, IF MS. GARRICK HAS SOME NEW EVIDENCE SHE WISHES TO SHARE WITH THIS COURT, THE PEOPLE WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO REVIEW IT. DO YOU HAVE NEW EVIDENCE, COUNSELOR? WELL, NOT EXACTLY, YOUR HONOR. I'M AFRAID MY CLIENT IS NOTORIOUSLY UNCOOPERATIVE, BUT WHILE REVIEWING THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATOR'S NOTES, I DISCOVERED SEVERAL DISCREPANCIES. I BELIEVE, IF GIVEN ENOUGH TIME, I CAN ACCOUNT FOR MY CLIENT'S WHEREABOUTS DURING AT LEAST TWO OF THE ALLEGED HOMICIDES. BUT YOUR CLIENT WAS NEVER CONVICTED FOR EITHER OF THESE CRIMES, WAS HE? UH, NO, YOUR HONOR, HE WASN'T. HE WASN'T EVEN CHARGED. HE WAS CHARGED AND CONVICTED OF ONLY ONE MURDER. THE MURDER OF HIS OWN SON. MS. GARRICK HAS THROWN UP AN ELABORATE SMOKE SCREEN AT THE PEOPLE'S EXPENSE. YOUR HONOR, I OBJEC TO MR. SILVERMAN'S IMPLICATION AND ATTITUDE. BUT HIS ARGUMEN IS NOT WITHOUT MERIT. AN ALIBI FOR A MURDER THAT YOUR CLIENT WAS NEVER CHARGED WITH IS NOT VALID GROUNDS FOR AN APPEAL. BUT JUDGE OLSON REFERRED TO THE OTHER HOMICIDES DURING SENTENCING, SO EVEN THOUGH MY CLIENT WAS NEVER TRIED AS A SERIAL KILLER, HE WAS CONVICTED AND SENTENCED AS ONE. OH, GOD. ZOE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP? ARE THEY ALL DEAD? ALL RIGHT. COME ON, YOUNG LADY. BACK TO BED. ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU ALL SETTLED IN NOW? YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM? NO. YOU DON'T NEED A DRINK OF WATER? NO. O.K. GOOD NIGHT, SWEETHEART. MMM. WHAT'S THE MATTER? NOTHING. DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE BAD DREAMS? ABOUT DADDY? HIM AND HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND, THEY WERE BOTH DEAD. OH... OH, SWEETHEART, DADDY'S FINE. DO YOU WANT TO CALL HIM JUST TO BE SURE? I'LL BET HE'S STILL UP. IT'S NOT THAT LATE IN LOS ANGELES. NO, THANKS. ALL RIGHT. WELL, MAYBE LATER. HEY, MAYBE WE CAN INVITE HIM TO YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY. I THINK I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP NOW, O.K.? [SIGHS] [SEVERAL TELEPHONES RINGING] WELL, I SEE YOU FOUND YOUR FRIEND, ALL RIGHT. ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR JOKES? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU ASKED FOR THIS STUFF. WHAT? PRISON IMPOUNDS DROPPED IT OFF. THEY HAD AN EVIDENCE REQUISITION REQUEST WITH YOUR SIGNATURE. OH, CHRIST. I COMPLETELY FORGOT. I ASKED FOR THIS STUFF THREE MONTHS AGO. THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP WITH THE APPEAL. OH, WELL. BETTER LATE THAN NEVER. WHEN'S THE DECISION? TOMORROW. AND IF THE JUDGE SAYS NO, I'M ALL SE TO ASK THE GOVERNOR FOR A STAY OF EXECUTION. NEVER HAPPEN. NOT IN AN ELECTION YEAR. "AND WHEN SHE REACHED THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF, "MATILDA LOOKED DOWN AT THE BIG GREEN OCEAN. "AND THEN SHE PULLED THE HAND MIRROR OUT OF HER BACKPACK "AND STARED INTO ITS SHINY SURFACE. "MATILDA'S REFLECTION WAS STILL BEAUTIFUL, "AND THE MIRROR'S FRAME AND HANDLE WERE STILL MADE OF GOLD, "ENCRUSTED WITH JEWELS. "BUT MATILDA WAS NO LONGER BLINDED BY THE BEAUTY. "SHE DROPPED THE MIRROR INTO THE OCEAN AND RAN HOME, HAPPY-- HAPPY TO BE JUST PLAIN MATILDA." SO... WHO CAN TELL ME THE MORAL? BETH? THE MORAL? [KIDS GIGGLING] YOU WERE LISTENING, WEREN'T YOU? YEAH, SORT OF. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. ZOE, WOULD YOU CARE TO GIVE BETH A HAND? I THINK WHAT IT'S SAYING IS THAT BAD THINGS DON'T ALWAYS LOOK BAD. SOMETIMES THEY EVEN LOOK GOOD. SO YOU THINK THE MIRROR IS A BAD THING? WELL, WHEN MATILDA FINDS IT, SHE THINKS IT'S GOING TO MAKE HER BEAUTIFUL AND POPULAR, BUT ALL IT REALLY DOES IS MAKE HER STUCK UP AND MEAN. WHAT DO YOU THINK, BETH? IS ZOE RIGHT? UH, UM, YEAH, I GUESS. WELL, THEN, WHEN THE TWO BES STUDENTS IN THE CLASS AGREE, THEN IT MUST BE RIGHT. O.K. NEXT WEEK WE'RE GOING TO START DR. DOLITTLE. GOOD. BETH LOVES TO DO LITTLE. [GIGGLING] [GIGGLING STOPS] WELL, IT'S A LONG SHOT, BUT I FILED AN APPEAL TO HAVE YOUR SENTENCE COMMUTED TO LIFE. THE JUDGE IS TAKING A FEW DAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT, WHICH IS POSSIBLY A GOOD SIGN. AT LEAST SHE DIDN' DENY IT RIGHT AWAY. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M TALKING ABOU SAVING YOUR LIFE. WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHY? LISTEN TO ME. I KILLED MY SON. EVEN IF I WERE FREE, MY LIFE WOULD BE MEANINGLESS. SO TELL ME... WHY WOULD I WANT TO EXTEND IT HERE IN THIS HELLHOLE, HUH? BUT I KNOW YOU DIDN' COMMIT THOSE OTHER MURDERS, AND THAT MEANS THE REAL KILLER IS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. THERE'S NO ONE OUT THERE. WHAT? THE OTHER CHILDREN? I MURDERED THEM. THEN WHY HAVE YOU KEP SILENT ALL THIS TIME? HUH? [GUARD] OFF THE GLASS, GOTTO! THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE, BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED. WHY DID YOU BURY HIM WITH THE PUPPET? PINOCCHIO? IT WAS HIS FAVORITE. I MADE IT FOR HIM MYSELF. [GUARD] OFF THE GLASS! FOR HIS LAST BIRTHDAY. THAT'S NOT EXACTLY THE ACTIONS OF A DERANGED MURDERER. WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT A DERANGED MURDERER? WHO ARE YOU PROTECTING? NO ONE. IT WAS ME. JUST LET ME DIE. HMM? PLEASE. WAIT. MR. GOTTO. [DOOR OPENS] MR. GOTTO! WHO REALLY KILLED THOSE CHILDREN? SOMEONE CLOSE TO YOU? IS THA WHY YOU'RE PROTECTING HIM? MR. GOTTO! STAY OUT OF IT! LET ME DIE! VISITING ROOM THREE! ON THE DOUBLE! JUST LET ME FUCKIN' DIE! PLEASE... STAY OUT OF IT! JUST LET ME DIE! PLEASE! [DOOR CLOSES] [BELL RINGS] PARTY AT MY HOUSE. THIS FRIDAY AFTER SCHOOL. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. THANKS, ZOE-BLOWY. I NEVER MISS A PARTY. HA HA HA HA! COME ON, BETH, GIVE THEM BACK! GIVE THEM BACK, BETH! I MEAN IT! WHAT? I'M NOT INVITED? WHAT YOU GOING TO DO? COME ON, BETH! YOU CAN DO IT! COME ON! AAH! GET HER OFF! GET HER OFF! GET HER OFF! [PANTING] OHH... I TOLD YOU SHE WAS CRAZY. YEAH. COME ON. YOU SHOWED HER, BETH. HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY? NOTHING SPECIAL. YOUR MOTHER TELLS ME YOU HAD ANOTHER NIGHTMARE. DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT? NO. WHEN SOMEBODY HURTS US, SOMEBODY WE'VE TRUSTED, IT'S NATURAL, EVEN HEALTHY, TO BE ANGRY WITH THEM. IT'S PART OF THE HEALING PROCESS. BUT IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON, ZOE. YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO FORGIVE HIM. FORGIVE WHO? WELL, YOU CAN BE SURE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. I HOPE NOT. NO. I UNDERSTAND. AGAIN, I'M REALLY SORRY. ALL RIGHT. BYE. ZOE. THAT WAS A MRS. WAYNE. SHE'S UNDERSTANDABLY UPSET, CONSIDERING SHE JUST CAME BACK FROM THE HOSPITAL, WHERE HER DAUGHTER HAD TWO STITCHES IN HER EAR. SHE SAID YOU BIT HER. SHE STARTED IT. I DON'T CARE WHO STARTED IT. WE DON'T BITE PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE. [TELEPHONE RINGS] HELLO. OH, HI, WARREN. GOOD TIMING. REALLY? YEAH. ZOE HAD ANOTHER FIGHT AT SCHOOL TODAY. WHAT? SHE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET THROWN OUT AGAIN. I KNOW THAT. I--I CAN'T EXACTLY FOLLOW HER TO CLASSES ALL DAY. HERE. YOU TALK TO HER. ZOE, IT'S DADDY. [WARREN] HELLO, ZOE. ZOE? HELLO? HELLO? ZOE? WARREN, I'LL CALL YOU LATER. O.K. BYE. YOU'RE GROUNDED, YOUNG LADY. NO TV AND NO PLAYING AFTER SCHOOL FOR TWO WEEKS! [DOOR SLAMS] MMM... YOU KNOW, HER BIRTHDAY IS THIS FRIDAY. OH, SHIT. WELL, SHE'S GROUNDED TILL THEN. [KNOCK ON DOOR] MAY I COME IN? CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING? HOW ABOUT MRS. PIGGLE WIG, HMM? NAH. SHE'S MAD AT ME. I FORGOT TO BRUSH OUT HER TAIL. BUT... WALTER SAYS HE WANTS TO SLEEP WITH ME TONIGHT. WHAT ELSE IS NEW? WALTER ALWAYS WANTS TO SLEEP WITH YOU. WHY DOES SHE ALWAYS TAKE EVERYONE ELSE'S SIDE? SHE DOESN'T, HONEY. SHE'S UNDER A LO OF STRESS RIGHT NOW, SO WE HAVE TO TRY AND HELP HER OU AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. I DO TRY, REALLY. BUT EVERYTHING ALWAYS TURNS OUT ALL WRONG. YOUR ARGUMENT HAS BEEN WELL-THOUGHT-OUT AND PRESENTED, AND I HAVE GIVEN IT A GREA DEAL OF CONSIDERATION. AND ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE YOU MAY HAVE A VALID POIN ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING YOUR CLIENT'S SENTENCING, THE FACT REMAINS THA IN THE EYES OF THE LAW, A ONE-TIME MURDERER IS JUST AS GUILTY AS A MULTIPLE MURDERER. THEREFORE, I CAN FIND NO JUSTIFICATION IN OVERTURNING JUDGE OLSON'S ORIGINAL SENTENCE. MOTION DENIED. JENNIFER! IS THIS YOUR LAST HOPE? WILL YOU APPEAL THE COURT'S DECISION? VINCENT GOTTO IS A VICTIM OF PUBLIC OPINION AND MEDIA HYPE. A BROADCAST THE OTHER NIGH REFERRED TO HIM AS A CONVICTED SERIAL KILLER, WHEN IN FACT HE'S NOT. EXCUSE ME, PLEASE. WILL YOU BE A WITNESS AT THE EXECUTION? [DOOR CLANGS] [PRIEST] THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD. I SHALL NOT WANT. HE MAKETH ME TO LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES. HE LEADETH ME BESIDE THE STILL WATERS. HE RESTORETH MY SOUL. HE LEADETH ME IN THE PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. THOU ANOINTES MY HEAD WITH OIL. MY CUP RUNNETH OVER. SURELY GOODNESS AND MERCY SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, AND I WILL DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER. [BELL RINGS] ARRRGH! ARRRGH! [GASPS] CAN I HELP YOU? [GASPS] I'M SOR--I'M SORRY. I--I DIDN'T MEAN TO STARTLE YOU. NO. IT'S O.K. ARE YOU A MEMBER OF THIS PARISH? NO, NO. ACTUALLY, TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, I'M NOT EVEN A CATHOLIC ANYMORE. I WAS DIVORCED LAST YEAR. THAT'S O.K. THIS ISN' A CATHOLIC CHURCH. IT'S EPISCOPALIAN. IT'S, UH, SORT OF LIKE CATHOLIC LIGHT. HA HA HA HA! COULD I, UM... UH, BUY YOU A CUP OF COFFEE? SO I QUIT THE FIRM, AND I TOOK A POSITION AT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. IT'S A LOT LESS MONEY, BUT THE SHORTER HOURS ALLOW ME MORE TIME WITH ZOE. SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU'VE MANAGED TO MAKE THE BES OF A DIFFICULT SITUATION. I WONDER. WHY IS THAT? ZOE'S BEEN HAVING THESE... HORRIBLE, VIOLEN NIGHTMARES LATELY, EVER SINCE I BECAME A P.D. HER THERAPIST THINKS SHE HAS A LOT OF REPRESSED HOSTILITY. OH, I... YOU THINK YOUR JOB IS TAKING ITS TOLL ON HER. NOT JUST ON HER. YOU KNOW, I DEAL WITH A LO OF BAD PEOPLE IN MY JOB. I PUT A LOT OF THEM ON THE STREET. AND THE FIRST TIME I HAD A CLIEN THAT I THOUGH WAS ACTUALLY INNOCENT, I COULDN'T SAVE HIM. [DOOR CLOSES] YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD, JENNY. LET IT GO... OR IT'LL TEAR YOU UP INSIDE. HOW COULD THE MAN WHO MADE THIS HAVE MURDERED HIS ONLY CHILD? EVIL COMES IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES. MAYBE HE DID KILL ALL THE OTHERS. NO. ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN WERE BEATEN WITH A BLUNT OBJECT. HIS SON WAS STRANGLED. SO? SO WHY THE DIFFERENT M.O.? MAYBE...THE OTHER MURDERS WERE PLANNED, BUT HIS SON WAS SPUR OF THE MOMENT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? MAYBE HIS SON FOUND OUT WHAT HE WAS DOING, AND HE HAD TO GET RID OF HIM... FAST. NO. GOTTO WAS DEFINITELY PROTECTING SOMEONE. BUT THE KILLINGS STOPPED AFTER HE WAS ARRESTED, RIGHT? SO HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT? HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND, JENNIFER. GOOD NIGHT. YOU, TOO. OW! OH, DAMN, ANOTHER NAIL GONE. [SPEED DIAL BEEPING] [TELEPHONE RINGS] GARRICK RESIDENCE. SOPHIA, HI. IT'S ME. HEY, DID WARREN REMEMBER TO CALL ZOE? YEAH, BUT, UH, SHE WOULDN'T COME TO THE PHONE. OH, MAN, SHE'S RELENTLESS. WONDER WHERE SHE GETS IT FROM. LISTEN, UM, THE TOY STORE CALLED, SAID THERE WAS A MIX-UP IN SHIPPING AND THEY WON'T HAVE THE DOLL TILL MONDAY. YOU'RE KIDDING. DID YOU TELL THEM I HAD TO HAVE IT TODAY? OF COURSE. THEY SAID THEY WERE VERY SORRY, BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT THEY COULD DO. OH, GREAT. O.K., UM... WELL, I GUESS I'LL LOOK FOR IT SOMEWHERE ELSE WHEN I GO GET THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE. I DON'T KNOW. BYE. HI, YOU GUYS. HEY, MOM. SWEETHEART, SORRY I'M LATE. CAN I GET UNDER HERE? WHAT'S IN THERE? DON'T ASK. HEY, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SEND OUT A SEARCH PARTY FOR YOU.

SHE SPOTTED IT BEFORE I COULD GET IT WRAPPED. WHERE'D YOU FIND THAT THING? IT LOOKS HAND-CARVED. [SINGING AND OVERLAPPING VOICES] I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON. COME ON, SWEETIE. O.K., MOMMY. BYE. SEE YOU AT SCHOOL. O.K. BYE, YOU GUYS. BYE! YAHOO! HAS ANYONE SEEN PINOCCHIO? HE'S MISSING? HE WAS RIGHT HERE A MINUTE AGO. LET'S HAVE A LOOK. [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] HERE I AM. JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE FIRE WAS OUT. WOOD, YOU KNOW? [EVERYONE LAUGHING] HA HA HA HA! HELP! ZOE, YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE DAVID. WOOD, YOU KNOW. HA HA HA... SOPHIA, WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE THOSE? I'LL DO THOSE TOMORROW. OH, I DON'T MIND. COME ON, IT'S LATE. I'LL DO THEM IN THE MORNING. YOU SURE? YEAH. YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH. ALL RIGHT, THEN. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. O.K. GOOD NIGHT. HEY, YOU. HEY, YOU. HOW YOU DOING? O.K. [GASP] OH, HO HO HO HO. HO HO. GOOD ONE, KIDDO. ZOE, YOU SCARED THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME. COME ON, MOMMY. IT'S JUST A LITTLE PUPPET. OH, NO, NO. IT'S NOT JUST ANY PUPPET. THIS IS PINOCCHIO. PINOCCHIO WASN'T SCARY. HE WAS GOOD. OH, YOU THINK SO, HUH? WASN'T HE? YEAH, THAT'S THE ONLY WAY HE COULD BECOME A REAL LIVE BOY. HE HAD TO BE GOOD. WELL, THAT'S TRUE, AND HE TRIED TO BE GOOD. HE TRIED REALLY HARD, BUT HE KEPT GIVING IN TO TEMPTATION AND DOING THESE REALLY BAD, BAD THINGS. AND THAT'S WHY THE BLUE FAIRY MADE HIS NOSE GROW LONGER EVERY TIME HE TOLD A LIE. THAT'S WHY SHE GAVE HIM A CRICKE TO AC AS HIS CONSCIENCE, TO TRY TO KEEP HIM FROM DOING THESE REALLY BAD, BAD THINGS. BUT NOTHING EVER WORKED. AND NOW... HE'S COMING AFTER YOU! [SCREAMING] SO DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME TONIGHT? YEAH. GOOD. HEY, SOPHIA SAID DADDY CALLED TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY. SWEETHEART, DADDY LOVES YOU VERY MUCH. HE WAS JUST UPSET. IT'S THE FIRST BIRTHDAY HE'S EVER MISSED. PINOCCHIO SAYS HE WANTS TO SLEEP WITH ME TONIGHT. PINOCCHIO'S FINE WHERE HE IS. NOW, REMEMBER, PINOCCHIO'S JUST VISITING UNTIL YOU GET YOUR REAL PRESENT, O.K.? BESIDES, HE WOULDN'T WAN TO SLEEP NEXT TO WALTER. WHY NOT? BECAUSE HE GOT SWALLOWED BY A WHALE, REMEMBER? ARRRGH! O.K. GOOD NIGHT, MOMMY. OH, I LOVE YOU. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. GOOD NIGHT. SO WHERE WERE WE? OHH... MMM... MMM... OHH... AHH... [THUNK] THERE YOU GO. I WISH YOU WERE A REAL BOY. THEN I WOULDN' BE ALL ALONE. [ENGINE STARTS] [GASP] WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY PINOCCHIO? WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM? AND THEN DAVID MADE PINOCCHIO TAP HIS OWN HEAD. AT FIRST I THOUGH IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY, BUT NOW I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE HURT PINOCCHIO'S FEELINGS. SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PARTY. YEAH. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU AND YOUR MOM REALLY LIKE DAVID. YEAH. YOU DO LIKE DAVID, DON'T YOU? YEAH, HE'S O.K., BUT... BUT WHAT? IF HE TAKES MY MOM AWAY, THEN I WON' HAVE ANYBODY. HEY, MOM. HI, SWEETHEART. HOW WAS SCHOOL? O.K. CAN WE TALK? WHAT'S UP? WELL...

I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. I'M TAKING IT BACK TO WORK TOMORROW ANYWAY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. SHE SEEMS TO HAVE FORMED A COMPULSIVE-DEPENDEN ATTACHMENT TO IT. SEPARATION AT THIS POINT MIGH BE TOO TRAUMATIC FOR HER. ZOE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR NEW BETTY DOLL? PINOCCHIO WAS JEALOUS. AND WHAT ABOU THE GIRL AT SCHOOL? SHE WAS PICKING ON ME. PINOCCHIO WAS JUS TRYING TO PROTECT ME. DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE COULD HAVE GOTTEN SERIOUSLY HURT? PINOCCHIO DIDN'T MEAN TO DO A BAD THING. HE JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG. HOW LONG'S IT BEEN LIKE THIS? EVER SINCE THE DIVORCE. WE'VE BEEN DRIFTING FURTHER AND FURTHER APART. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE. COULD YOU QUIT YOUR JOB AND STAY HOME WITH HER FULL-TIME? DOES WARREN PAY ALIMONY? MM-MMM. JUST CHILD SUPPORT. I WAS MAKING MORE MONEY THAN HE WAS WHEN WE SEPARATED. THAT WAS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS. WELL, YOU KNOW YOU COULD ALWAYS MOVE IN WITH ME. WHY NOT? YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU AND ZOE. I KNOW. I KNOW. I LOVE THE OFFER. BUT ZOE'S BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH CHANGES FOR ONE YEAR. HERE. SPOON ME. [SIREN] LOOK, THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THE DECEASED WAS A WELL-KNOWN PUSHER AND PIMP. TO TELL THE TRUTH, I DON'T SEE ANY JURY FEELING ANY SYMPATHY TOWARD HIM. OH, GEE... WOW. UM, MAYBE THEY'LL HAVE A CHANGE OF HEAR WHEN THEY HEAR HOW HE DIED. SEE, YOUR CLIENT, HE--HE HUNG HIM ON A MEAT HOOK, AND THEN HE TORTURED HIM TO DEATH WITH A BLOWTORCH. YOU KNOW, HE EVEN RECORDED IT SO HE COULD LISTEN TO I AND ENJOY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT'S GREAT. HERE, TAKE A LISTEN. AAH! AAH! [CHUCKLING] NO! PLEASE! GOD, NO! OOH. NO, PLEASE, GOD! AAH! THAT'S GOT TO HURT. AAH! [CHUCKLING] AAH! AAH! [LAUGHING] [RETCHING] [WATER RUNNING] HA HA...

IT TOLD ME TO-- IT TOLD ME TO KILL HIM AND HAND OUT HIS STUFF. THE TELEVISION TOLD YOU TO KILL THE PUSHER? DAMN STRAIGHT. I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT OTHERWISE. I LIKED THE GUY. DO YOU MEAN YOU SAW A SHOW ON VIGILANTES OR SOMETHING? NO. IT WASN'T NO DAMN SHOW. THE BOX WASN'T EVEN ON. ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT CRAZY, LADY. THE BOX DID TALK TO ME. IT'S BEDTIME, SWEETHEART. GOOD NIGHT. DO YOU WANT ME TO COME TUCK YOU IN? NO, THANKS. [ZOE] STOP PLAYING AROUND NOW. WE HAVE TO GO TO BED. I'M THE ONE WHO IS GETTING INTO TROUBLE, O.K.? ZOE...ARE YOU TALKING TO SOMEONE IN THERE? JUST PINOCCHIO. OH...O.K. ZOE, YOU SHOULDN' TELL PEOPLE I TALK TO YOU. WHY NOT? BECAUSE THEY'LL TAKE ME AWAY FROM YOU. THEN I'LL NEVER GET TO BE A REAL BOY AND BE YOUR BROTHER. YOU REALLY THINK WE'LL BE A FAMILY SOMEDAY-- YOU, ME, AND MOM? SURE. YOU KNOW I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU. BUT WE CAN'T BE TOO SURE ABOUT MOM... NOT AS LONG AS DAVID'S AROUND. I KNOW. I CAN MAKE DAVID GO AWAY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? PINOCCHIO. REMEMBER, YOU CAN' BECOME A REAL BOY IF YOU KEEP DOING BAD THINGS. GETTING RID OF DAVID WOULD BE A GOOD THING, THE SAME WAY PUNISHING THA BITCH AT SCHOOL WAS A GOOD THING. [FOOTSTEPS] PINOCCHIO. WHERE ARE YOU? [FOOTSTEPS] ZOE! [GASP] WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP? GETTING PINOCCHIO. I THOUGH HE WAS IN YOUR ROOM. NO. HE'S IN THE BASEMENT. WHOA. I'LL GET HIM. YOU GO TO BED. NO. THAT'S O.K. I'LL GET HIM. NO.

IS HE O.K.? WE'VE NOTIFIED HIS PARENTS. IF YOUR DAUGHTER HADN'T DIALED 911, I DON'T THINK HE WOULD HAVE MADE IT. [SIREN] O.K. ALL RIGHT. PINOCCHIO, DID YOU MAKE DAVID FALL DOWN THOSE STAIRS? ANSWER ME! DID YOU MAKE DAVID FALL DOWN THOSE STAIRS? NO. YOU'RE LYING, AREN'T YOU? YOU KNOW, MOM WOULD HAVE TO SPEND A LOT MORE TIME WITH US IF SOPHIA WASN'T AROUND. ZOE? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GETTING BUGS. I FORGOT. I HAD TO BRING ONE FOR SCIENCE TODAY. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY HOME FROM SCHOOL TODAY. NO. I'M O.K. YOU SURE? REALLY? REALLY. O.K. MMM. HAVE A GOOD DAY.

IN THE ORIGINAL ITALIAN VERSION, PINOCCHIO ACTUALLY HAD A VERY BAD TEMPER, AND HE SQUASHED THE CRICKE DURING ONE OF HIS TANTRUMS. COME ON. DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT DAVID'S ACCIDENT? YOUR MOTHER SAYS THAT HE WAS VERY SERIOUSLY HURT. YOU MUST HAVE SOME FEELINGS ABOUT THAT. [INTERCOM BEEPS] DR. EDWARDS? I'M WITH A PATIENT, KELLY.

[JENNIFER SOBBING] I OFTEN VIDEOTAPE MY SESSIONS TO DO A MORE THOROUGH CASE STUDY LATER ON. DURING YOUR DAUGHTER'S LAST VISIT, I WAS CALLED OUT OF THE OFFICE FOR A FEW MINUTES. [CLICK] I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY. NOW HE THINKS I HURT DAVID. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? NO, I DON'T! YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SLAMMED THE DOOR IN HIS FACE. WHO ELSE COULD I HAVE BEEN? OH, NO. IT WASN'T ME. IT WAS YOU. SHUT UP. SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! I WANT YOUR PERMISSION TO HAVE ZOE COMMITTED. NO. NO. BUT SHE'S OBVIOUSLY DANGEROUS TO HERSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS. SPARE ME THE LECTURE, DOCTOR. I DEAL WITH DANGEROUS PEOPLE EVERY DAY. I KNOW WHAT EVIL LOOKS LIKE. I SEE IT IN THE EYES OF MY CLIENTS, AND I'M TELLING YOU, I DON'T SEE I IN MY DAUGHTER! NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT EVIL, BUT SHE'S A VERY DISTURBED LITTLE GIRL. SHE DIALED 911. SHE SAVED DAVID'S LIFE, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! IF YOU DON'T HAVE HER COMMITTED, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO NOTIFY THE AUTHORITIES. OF WHAT? YOUR SUSPICIONS? IF YOU BREACH ZOE'S DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP WITHOUT SOME VERY STRONG, HARD EVIDENCE, I WILL USE ALL OF MY LEGAL RESOURCES TO HAVE YOUR LICENSE PULLED! [DOOR SLAMS] HI. THERE'S SOME DINNER IN THE OVEN IF YOU ARE HUNGRY. HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP? O.K. WHERE'S ZOE? WHAT? ZOE. WHERE IS SHE? ALREADY IN BED. WHY? IS SOMETHING WRONG? HOW DID THESE GET MUDDY? I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S HOW THEY WERE WHEN I FOUND THEM IN ZOE'S ROOM THIS MORNING. ZOE, WAKE UP. WAKE UP. HUH? WHERE DID YOU GO LAST NIGHT? WHAT? WHERE DID YOU GO LAST NIGHT? NOWHERE. DON'T LIE TO ME. YOUR SLIPPERS AND JAMMIES ARE ALL MUDDY. ALL RIGHT. I WENT OUTSIDE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT? WHY? ZOE, WHY? I WANTED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL, O.K.? TO SEE DAVID. DID YOU? DID YOU? NO. I COULDN'T FIND IT. I GOT LOST, SO I CAME HOME. ARE YOU SURE? ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN' GO TO THE HOSPITAL? NO. HONEST! BUT I THINK PINOCCHIO DID. THAT'S IT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE. DON'T YOU MOVE. WAIT! WAIT! BUT I-- DON'T PUSH ME, ZOE! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! [DOOR CREAKS] [KNIVES SCRAPING TOGETHER] ZOE? ZOE... WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THIS, SWEETHEART? HMM? COME HERE. I WAS PROTECTING YOU FROM PINOCCHIO. OH, SWEETHEART. PINOCCHIO CAN'T HURT ME. HE CAN'T HUR ANYBODY. ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HIM BACK TO JAIL? YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD, DON'T YOU? MM-HMM. NO MATTER WHAT. O.K. OHH. SOPHIA, ZOE'S NOT GOING TO GO TO SCHOOL TODAY. SO, IF YOU'D KEEP HER HOME AND KEEP AN EYE ON HER? IS SHE SICK? MMM...I'M NOT SURE. BUT I'M GOING TO TALK TO BARRY ABOUT WORKING OUT OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. OH, AND I'M GOING TO MAKE ONE STOP AFTER WORK, BUT I STILL SHOULD BE HOME EARLY. THANK YOU. DO YOU BELIEVE IN EVIL? IT'S A JOB REQUIREMEN IN MY BUSINESS. RIGHT. BUT DO YOU BELIEVE IT CAN BE A... YOU KNOW, A TANGIBLE, NATURAL FORCE? JENNIFER, WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? I THINK I KNOW WHO GOTTO WAS PROTECTING. HIS SON. I THINK HE FOUND OU WHAT HIS SON WAS DOING, AND HE STOPPED HIM THE ONLY WAY HE KNEW HOW. THAT'S WHY ALL THE MURDERS STOPPED AFTER THAT NIGHT. NOT BECAUSE GOTTO WAS ARRESTED, BUT BECAUSE THE REAL KILLER WAS DEAD. DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT A CHILD THAT YOUNG IS CAPABLE OF THAT MUCH EVIL? THE SON OF SAM... HE CLAIMED HIS NEIGHBOR'S DOG TOLD HIM TO KILL. AND THE GUY IN THE TEXAS TOWER, HE HEARD VOICES IN HIS HEAD. I MEAN, WE JUST ASSUME THEY WERE INSANE, BUT WHAT IF THEY REALLY DID HEAR THOSE VOICES? WHAT IF SOME KIND OF DEMON OR EVIL FORCE WAS TALKING TO THEM, MANIPULATING THEM, MAKING THEM INTO KILLERS? I DON'T KNOW. I DO PERSONALLY BELIEVE IN DEMONS. BUT I'M NOT SO SURE THAT ONE WOULD TAKE THE FORM OF A DOG. WHY NOT? WHY NOT A DOG... OR A DISEMBODIED VOICE... OR A TELEVISION, OR... A PUPPET? [TURNS VACUUM OFF] HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY, HONEY? O.K. CAN I HAVE SOME JUICE? SURE. A LITTLE RESTLESS TODAY? I'M WORRIED ABOUT PINOCCHIO. I'M SURE YOUR MOM'S TAKING GOOD CARE OF HIM. NO. I'M WORRIED HE MIGHT HURT HER. THAT'S O.K. HE'S GOT A CONSCIENCE NOW, REMEMBER? YOU FOUND I FOR HIM. AAH! ZOE? ZOE? ZOE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? ZOE? AAH! AAH! AAH! [THUNDER] [VACUUM CLEANER ROARS] [THUNDER] OH, WHAT AM I DOING? OH, MY GOD. [CLATTERING] [THUNDER] ZOE...WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? ZOE, WAIT! WAIT, PLEASE! LET ME HELP YOU, SWEETHEART! ZOE! ZOE? UNH! [BARRY] EVIL COMES IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES. [MICHAELS] DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE A CHILD THAT YOUNG IS CAPABLE OF THAT MUCH EVIL? [EDWARDS] SHE'S A VERY DISTURBED LITTLE GIRL. NO! JUST DON'T! PLEASE! IT'S O.K.! IT'S O.K.! I GOT THE POKER AWAY FROM HIM, BUT WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE HE COMES BACK! ZOE! [FOOTSTEPS] ZOE? AAH! DIE! [SNARLING] I'M GOING TO GET YOU! STOP! STOP! STOP! UNH! LET ME IN! OPEN THE DOOR! LET ME IN! LET ME IN, YOU BITCH! YOU HEAR ME? AAH! AAH! AAH! MOM, WHERE ARE YOU? MOM! MOM! ZOE, RUN! GET OUT OF THE HOUSE! [DOOR CLOSES] [FOOTSTEPS] [PINOCCHIO] GOTCHA! AAH! [CHILD LAUGHING] [LAUGHTER] [SNARLING] AAH! MOM, HELP ME! [SOBBING] ZOE... [SNARLING] AAH! [EVIL LAUGHTER] AAH! [SNARLING] AAH! HOW LONG WILL SHE BE LIKE THIS? HARD TO SAY. WE'LL KEEP HER CALM AND SEDATED UNTIL SHE COMES AROUND. SHE'S NOT DANGEROUS. SHE KILLED YOUR NANNY AND YOUR BOYFRIEND, AND SHE ALMOS KILLED YOU. I KEEP TELLING YOU IT WASN'T HER. THE ROOM WAS DARK. YOU WERE SUFFERING FROM A SEVERE CONCUSSION. I KNOW WHAT I SAW. TELL ME SOMETHING... DID YOU SEE THE PUPPE MOVE BEFORE OR AFTER YOU WERE HI IN THE HEAD? I KNOW WHAT I SAW. [SIGHS] AND I'M GOING TO GE MY DAUGHTER OUT OF HERE NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES. I HOPE NOT. FOR YOUR SAKE... I HOPE NOT. [DOOR CLOSES]
