So they dig the grave in the middle of the road where people pass all the time. Well, thats a cheerful introduction for you to our West Indies. Do you know where is the house of monsieur Beaumont? Zombies! Aller vite! Allez! It felt like hands touching me! Why did you drive like that, you fool? We might have been killed! Worse than that, Monsieur. We might have been caught. Caught? By whom? Those men you spoke to? They are not men Monsieur, they are dead bodies. Dead? Yes, Monsieur. Zombies. The living dead. Corpses taken from their graves who are made to work in sugar mills and fields at nights. Look! Here they come! Look! Look! Excuse me please, have you got a match? Did I frighten you? Ha, Im sorry. Im oddly enough I suppose. No, it wasnt you. Something happened back on the road there. We stopped to speak to some men. Our driver told us that they werent men at all. He said they were corpses. Corpses? Surely you dont believe it, do you? No. But I dont know - Haiti is full of nonsense and superstition. Theyre always mixed up with a lot of mysteries that will turn your hair grey. Ive been a missionary here for, oh, thirty years, and at times I dont know what to think. Come, lets go in the house. Oh, yes, come, dear. Is Mr. Beaumont in? You are expected, Dr. Bruner. Yes, Ive been sent for to marry someone. Maybe you... How long is it that youve known Mr. Beaumont? Oh, only a few days. Madeline introduced him on the docks in Port-au-Prince. Ah, and you? I met him on the ship coming from New York. He was very kind during the voyage. Madeline and I planned to be married the moment she arrived, but Mr. Beaumont persuaded us to come here. And he promised to take me out of the bank at Port-au-Prince and send me to New York as his agent. Strange. Very strange. You... Ill tell Mr. Beaumont you are here. Its all right, isnt it, doctor? Oh, I guess so. You see I, Ive only met Mr. Beaumont once or twice. But he never struck me like the man who would take the trouble to play fairy godfather to a young couple like you... Unless... Unless what, sir? I suppose youll think Im a meddling old fool, but... You know, Id feel a good deal better if youd clear out of this place after youre married, and have nothing more to do with Mr. Beaumont. The young people have arrived sir, and Dr. Bruner. They are waiting in the reception hall. Show them to their rooms, and tell them Im out. No wait. Perhaps Id better see them. It might look odd if I didnt. Very odd, sir. Especially as Dr. Bruner is a trifle skeptical as to your - motives, sir. Nevermind my motives. Has that other person sent word yet? No, sir. Not yet. Hes twenty-four hours late. I wish youd keep away from that man, sir. He'll make trouble for you. You needn't worry about that. I'm not affraid of him. I'm not easily frightened, sir. You should know that. But what you are planning is dangerous. Dont you suppose I know that, Silver? You dont seem to realize what this girl means to me. Why, Id sacrifice anything I have in the world for her. Nothing matters if I cant have her. I think, ah, I think youll like Haiti. Most people that... Madeline! Im delighted to see you! Neil, youre more than welcome. Thank you, sir. Doctor, it is very kind of you to come. I know what a busy man you are. No, ah, not at all. There is a native family live out here that Ive been trying to see for a long time. After this young couple are safely married, I'll leave. But surely you will stay for dinner after the ceremony? No, no, no. No, I must run along. Thats a great pity. We have something very special prepared for this occasion. It was very good of you, Madeline, to humour the whim of a lonely man. There was so little time to prepare, I couldnt do half the things I wanted for you. Youve done more than enough already Mr. Beaumont, for a comparative stranger... Giving Neil a position in The States. Neil? Yes. Yes indeed. Oh, yes of course! Im sure Neil will make a very good agent. But you must be tired after your drive. You get some rest. Silver! Silver will show you to your rooms. This way please. Delighted to see you again, monsieur Beaumont! Please. Please. Im sorry to have kept you waiting, monsieur. Ive been on a journey seeking men for my mills. Men? They work faithfully... They are not worried about long hours. You can make good use of men like mine on your plantations. No. Thats not what I want. Then perhaps we should talk about the young lady who came to your house this evening? Youve seen her? When? The road, tonight. There was a young man with her. They are to be married, tonight. You waited too long to do anything. What do you want me to do? If she were to disappear, for a month... What do you hope to gain by her disappearance? Everything... Everything? Do you think she will forget her lover in a month? Just give me a month. One little month. Not in a month. Not even a year, monsieur. I looked into her eyes. She is deep in love. But not with you. They are to be married within an hour! There must be a way! There is way. The cost... The cost is heavy! You give me what I want, and you may ask anything. No! Not that! Only a pin point, monsieur Beaumont, in a glass of wine or perhaps a flower. Take it. The time is very brief. You must do your share if I am to help you. Keep it, monsieur. Keep it. You may change your mind. Send me word when you use it. - Ill find another way. - There is no other way. They are driving away evil spirits! Close it, close it! Mademoiselle! I love you, Madeline, more than anything else in this whole world, dear. Heaven or hell lies in this little moment for me. You could raise me up to paradise or you could blast my world into nothingness. I can make you the envy of every woman. Id give my life to make you happy! Oh, listen to me dear before its too late! Dont, please. Dont go into that room. We can be in Port-au-Prince in half an hour. Theres a boat sailing at midnight. Youve been so wonderful. Dont spoil everything now. One last gift before I lose you forever! We are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of this company, to join together this man, this woman in holy matrimony. This is the night of nights! A toast to the bride! To beautys queen! Gladly, My Lord! Leave but a kiss within the glass. Fair gypsy, read my fortune. What do you see in the glass? I see happiness... I see love, far more than you can bear. Is that all? No. I see... I see... What is it? I see death. Death? Madeline, whats wrong? Madeline my dear, please. , no... Madeline? Madeline? Cant we do something? Please, please. Madeline! Not my wife. My wife! Praise of our lord and saviour and the love of god and the fellowship of his angels. Be with us ever more. Amen. Neil, Neil... Neil... Neil... Neil... Look! Zombies! Yes. They are my servants. Did you think we could do it alone? In their lifetime they were my enemies. Ledot, the witch doctor. Once my master. Secrets I tortured out of him. Von Gelder, the swine. Swollen with riches. He fought against my spells until the last. In him I have a struggling type. His Excellence, Richard. Once minister of the interior. Scarpia, Brigand Chief. Marcquis, Captain of Gendarmerie. And this... this is Chauvin. The high executioner, who almost executed me! I took them just as we will take this one. But what if they regain their souls? They would tear me to pieces. But that, my friend, shall never be. Madeline! Madeline! Madeline! Madeline! Theres two explanations that strike me, either the body was stolen by the members of a death cult that use human bones in their ceremonies, or else... Or else what? Shes not dead. Not dead? Are you mad? I saw her die, the doctor signed the certificate. I saw them bury her. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. Im not mad. But Ive lived in these islands for a good many years, and Ive seen things with my eyes that made me think I was crazy. There are superstitions in Haiti that the natives brought here from Africa. Some of them can be traced back as far as ancient Egypt, and beyond that yet, in the countries that was old when Egypt was young. Yes, but what has that to do with Madeline? I kissed her as she lay there in the coffin. And her lips were cold. Let me explain. Now, just a minute, Ill explain. Wherever there is a superstition, you will find there is also a practice. Now, do you remember what your driver told you the night that he took you to Beaumonts house? Oh, about those horrible creatures we saw? He said they were corpses! Taken from their graves. Yes - thats the superstition! Now for the practice. The ghouls that steal the dead corpses from their graves, are supposed to put them there in the first place. Do you mean that Madeline was murdered so that somebody could steal her dead body? Aagh! Nonsense! No, no. Not her... Her body, yes; but not her dead body. Thats what I meant. Well, surely you dont think shes alive, in the hands of natives? Oh no, better dead than that! Excuse me please, have you got a match? Thank you. You dont believe that, do you? Say, theres been lots of people thats been pronounced dead that came alive again and lived for years. Now, if nature can play pranks like that, why isnt it possible to play pranks with nature? Oh, I dont know. Your driver believed he saw dead men, walking. He didnt. What he saw was man alive and everything but this and this. Oh, the whole thing has me confused! I just cant understand it. Um, I dont blame you... I dont blame you. Ive been trying for years to get to the bottom of these things. To separate what you call fact from fiction. The law! The law of Haiti acknowledges the possibility of being buried alive. Here it is in the penal code. Ill read it for you. Its in French - do you speak French? No. Excuse me please, have you got a match? Right here, heres one. Oh, thank you. I didnt see it there. Ill translate it for you. If you could spare me. Article... Article 2.49. The use... The use of drugs or other practices which produce lethargic coma, or lifeless sleep, shall be considered attempted murder. Attempted! Yes I see. If the person has been buried alive, the act should be considered murder no matter what result follows. Beaumont! Say, you said you couldnt understand why he was so interested in us. Do you think he did this? No. No, I think his natives would. Natives would be right. Of course if you want to, we could go to Beaumonts house first. If I could get my hands on the devil thats responsible for this, Ill make him such an example that every witch doctor in Haiti would be shaking in his sandals. But we cant do this alone. Cant the authorities help? The authorities, Neil, my boy, you dont know these islands. The native authorities are afraid to meddle. I am not. Ive got friends among the natives. Theyll tell me things that no jandam could ever get out of them. Because I am a preacher. They think I am a magician. Before we get through with this thing, we may uncover sins that even the devil would be ashamed of. Oh, these witch doctors... Madeline... Foolish things, they cant bring back the light to those eyes. I was mad to do this, but if you had smiled on me, Id have done anything for you. Given you anything. I thought that beauty alone would satisfy, but the soul is gone... I cant bear those empty staring eyes. Oh, forgive me, Madeline. Forgive me! I cant bear it any longer. I must take you back. Back to the grave, Monsieur? No, you must put the life back into her eyes and bring laughter to her lips. She must be gay and happy again! You paint a charming picture, Monsieur. One that I should like to see myself! You must bring her back. Arent you a trifle afraid, Monsieur? How do suppose those eyes will regard you when the brain is able to understand? Better to see hatred in them than that dreadful emptiness. Perhaps youre right. It would be a pity to destroy such a lovely flower. Lets drink to the future of this flower. A glass of wine! Silver, bring wine! We have a toast to drink. To the future, Monsieur! Only a pin point, Monsieur. In a flower... or perhaps in a glass of wine? You devil! What are you trying to do to me? I have other plans for Mademoiselle. And I am afraid you might not agree. I have taken a fancy to you, Monsieur! Silver! Silver! Dont, dont! To the future, Monsieur! The vulture, you... No. Not that. Not that! We ought to be picking up an old witch doctor around here pretty soon. His name is Pierre, Ive known him for years. Bright old fellow. I dont know just where well find him. Come, son. There are evil spirits in the road. I will give you an awonga. And here, this one for the ox. Young man is sick with distress. Well hey, wait a minute, we cant afford to have you sick. Neil, why dont you go over there, we've got a hard day before us tomorrow. Now, now then Pierre, come on. Hes gone. We can talk. It is a dangerous thing you ask me to do. Well now listen here you know, we're old friends, you and me, and I want to go on. Turn back before it is too late! Oh, no. Ive come too far to turn back now. Im too old to go all this way with you. Well listen, cant you get somebody to go with us? My people all afraid of the mountain. Why? Because it is called the land of the living dead. Well, have, have you ever been there? I am the only man that has ever come back from there alive. There is an evil spirit man that is called Murder. Come, I will tell you all about what he did. Vulture. Just as old Pierre said. A cloud of vultures always hovers over the house of the living dead. Madeline... Is she there? Oh, I must go and see her. Neil, my boy, please, please lie down and rest. Please. Youll feel stronger in the morning. You rest. Let me go up and see what I can do. Why is she so restless tonight? Perhaps she remembers something? They never remember anything when they are like that. No? Because shes cut off. Madeline! Madeline! No, no, I cant, I cant! You must, its your turn. Lets run away! He might hear you! No way. I cant stand it. I am going to run away! He will find you and make you like her. Can you still hear me? It is unfortunate you are no longer able to speak. I should be interested to hear you describe your symptoms... You see, you are the first man to know what is happening. None of the others did. You refused to shake hands once. I remember. Well, well. We understand each other better now. Madeline! Madeline! Madeline! Madeline! I found you! Youre alive. Alive! Whats the matter? Its I, Neil. Oh my darling, what have they done to you? Who are you? And what are they? For you, my friend, they are the angels of death. Come! Zombies! Duck! Look! Madeline, dont you know me, dear? Its Neil. I could swear, for a moment she recognized you. Come on, dont let him get away! Madeline, my darling! Neil, I... I dreamed? Excuse me please, have you got a match?
