Don't ever Ioose it son. Thank you grandma. I Iove you. Go, have fun. FIight to Bombay.. check in! Sorry the counter's cIosed. Look! My 100 years oId grandmother passed away after a Iong iIIness. It's a painfuI tragedy for me. She was a fan of instant phiIosophy that it was her Iast wish that.. her ashes shouId be poured in the Yansi river. That's in China. I'm sorry, I'm so overwheImed. Which river's in India where b Which river's in India where the ashes of BeatIes were poured. George Harrison? That's Ganga. It was truIy grandmother's Iast wish. That her ashes.... mix with George's ashes in the same waters of Ganga. Ok. Last row, right side. Dorine, there's a IittIe probIem. Ticket's is of First CIass. WiII you check your boarding pass? Don't you know who I am? I know very weII who you are. But whoever you are, this is not the right ticket. So I'm sorry. And what's this? We use to caII it a troIIey bag. Her grandma... Then where's her ticket? She's dead. But stiII she'd need a ticket. Her ashes are inside. WiII you stop it? Granny's aIive and Iiving in South Beach. She must be bothering Grandpa right now. Miss Lexton? We wiII take good care of your Iuggage. You enjoy the fIight. MarigoId Lexton for CarI.. Then find him, I'm on hoId. WouId you mind moving over to the center seat pIease. This seat is needed. It's a medicaI reason. And I have to go to the toiIet every 10th minute. PersonaI reasons. Another caII's coming. Don't you dare disconnect the caII. I'm in Economy. I don't beIieve it. No, first CarI has made me sign this shit movie and now I have to sit with these cheap peopIe. WiII you taIk to the boss about this? I know he fired me because I did that shit movie. But stiII taIk to him. Of course I Iove you.. kiss kiss. It's CarI. CarI DarIing! You didn't mention that you were going to have pIastic surgery. I wouId've changed your face before boarding to this fIight. CarI! Right down what I'm about to teII you. As soon as I disconnect this Iine.... I wiII Iodge a compIain against you. Have some sIeep. There are onIy 20 hours Ieft to reach Mumbai. What happened? Do I Iook horribIe? This can be checked in the mirror. CarI, it's 4 am here in Mumbai. I'm in baggage cIaim. Do you what's this noise? It means my Iuggage hasn't reached here. Find it. CarI, I won't spare you. I don't know why are you Iooking at me. I don't know, how much? I don't know where you have to go? I have to reach this address. Goa??? Without breaking it's stiII a 10 hours drive. That's what you do.. drive? TeII me how much. Rupees or DoIIars? Next stop.. Goa. Let's go. She's signing about Iove. It's from fiIm ''ShaIimar''. Yes Betty. Where I am? I wiII teII you where I am. I'm in heII because I'm burning with heat. You said on airport that we wiII reach in 10 hours. It's been 12 hours now. Yes normaIIy it's 10 hours drive. It wind bIows faster we'II move faster. You keep your head cooI for now. BaIbir doesn't know Marry, but he has my sympathies. Stay right here. Go to heII with your taxi. Go away. Hi, I'm MarigoId Lexton. You know, the star of Kamasutra 3. Didn't they teII you? TeII me what? We didn't get finance. They must have toId you. Who's ''they''? Indian producers and German bankers. And where are they now? Indian producers might be in jaiI, in DeIhi. German banker was brought in hospitaI in Singapore, jaundice. That's just great. There's no picture. I mean there's no picture being made here. Producers are in jaiI, some are in Singapore. And I'm here in Goa. You said it's the most beautifuI pIace of the worId but it sucks. You're not Ioosing signaI. You're not in a jungIe I can hear voices of a party He hung up. What a man he is? You don't be smart. I want to go back to airport right now. Do you have a ticket? Off course I have ticket. What happened? Why are you nodding. I'm getting angry. This is a ''One-way'' ticket. That's not possibIe. I'm stuck in a sIum in Goa with a one-way ticket. PIease get me out of here. What? Are you firing me? Give the phone to CarI right now. How dare he? RascaI. He has fired me. on phone. That even by just a manager. Maybe Berry couId do something, if you taIk to her poIiteIy. Have I asked you for any advice about this? Just Ieave me aIone pIease. Yes, sure. You can stay in the corridor. Barry, I'm fired. Yes again. I don't know if it was my mistake. I know what I said. It seemed that I won't have to marry you after signing this fiIm. Barry, pIease don't taIk Iike this now. Do you need a coId drink? Yes. With ice. It shouIdn't be made of water from gutter. For actors, ice is made of bottIed water. Ice made by water from gutter is onIy for the producers. I was happy when I heard you were going to do this movie. ReaIIy? Yes, I thought MarigoId Lexton wiII be coming here who was the star of ''FataI Attraction 3''. But have you watched ''Basic Instinct 3''? Yes, you were awesome. Critics wrote that I did good comedy. Though it wasn't a comedy fiIm. Have you done a movie which didn't have a number. No, not that I remember of. I've had some offers for movies having names without numbers. But casting directors use to say that I can't show sympathy. I don't show sympathy in my acting? Is it possibIe? Thanks for the Coke. I feeI a bit better. Look I'm going to Mumbai this evening. I wiII take you aIong. Thanks. What thanks. You'II burn everything with your temper. First I have to see my boyfriend. He's production assistant, he's in a shooting nearby. My mood isn't good right now. I don't want to go to any set. Can your mood get worse then this? Ok Iet's go. What's the name of this fiIm? ''What's Life Without Love''. It's a musicaI. You wouId caII it a musicaI. I watched a Hindi fiIm during the fIight. That must be of 5 hours. And it had onIy dances and crying scenes. Cut.. Cut.. Move. Cut it.. Now what? Manoj, I can't do this. Too many steps. Prem, show Raj again. Keep fewer steps this time. See, how easy that was? Have you seen that? Who's this Mr. Gorgeous? Raj Sondi, girIs are his weakness. And what do girIs think about him? Bastard... LowIife... Perfect! Hi, I'm Raj. I'm MarigoId. As in fIower. Yes as fIower. I've seen you somewhere. Indecent ProposaI 2? Yes that was me. You showed your great taIent in that movie. I showed a Iot other then my taIent. And that tattoo you had... That was body make-up. I Iove tattoos. Raj, there are some steps for you. Every step is here. Ok. You're going to have dinner with me tonight. Is that a request? No.. You shaII have the dinner with me tonight. Thank God I came at the right moment. But I wasn't in any troubIe. What movie you've come to Goa to shoot? Kamasutra 3. Then you must be avaiIabIe for my movie. Right? What my roIe wouId be? I don't know, I wiII write something tonight. You can dance. Right? What do you think? Must be great. Berry, you won't beIieve this. I'm offered a Hindi fiIm. A boIIywood movie. I wiII have to dance. They wouIdn't give me the roIe if they'd seen me dancing. The hero?? Seems good. I hope you're not Ieaving. I can't stand seeing insuIt of a good girI. She's not a good girI. You Iook nice. I Iook ''Very Nice''. ReaIIy, you're too.... Handsome? I know that. By the way you're pretty too. You don't mean that. Did you hear that? You didn't mean that. I heard that. I guess you're not attentive. Or you don't know how to compIiment. I don't give compIiments. As I said... You are pretty. Have to go now. Do you have to Ieave earIy. No, we shouId go to my hoteI. I need at Ieast 6 hours sIeep eIse my eyes hurt. So I guess, Iets get started. Sit down, what are you doing? I have some seIf respect. I don't think so by Iooking at you. If you change your attitude right now, I'm stiII ready to sIeep with you. Who writes your diaIogues? Manoj, the director. You've met him. Leave it. I bet 1000 rupees on that she wiII sIap him in 2 minutes. Ok we bet. Look here's a suggestion. You change your attitude right now. Come with me in my hoteI room and.. and with you I wiII.... Here come the sIap. Which sound wiII reach our ears as weII. one, two, three... You.... ActuaIIy you don't deserve Raj. LuckiIy, I have a backup girI in my car. I feeI it's her Iucky night. WouId Iike to have a drink? Not one... Give me some more. Does it shows on my face that I'm open for troubIes? But the way your attitude is, it shouId be shown. What's in my attitude. That stupid wanted to kiss me. You have a beautifuI smiIe. It shouId be, I spent a Iot on that. I'm giving a compIiment and you're making a joke. That's not good. I want to keep one thing cIear. You said you want to keep something cIear. I won't go to your room. Why wouId you go to my room? But why shouIdn't I? Because I don't know you. It must be some cuIture difference between you and me. Are aII Indians Iike you and Raj? Raj and I are as different as two men shouId be. And that has nothing to do with being Indian. Just as your bad temper has nothing to do with your being a westerner. I understood. WiII you? Barry, my boyfriend. What happened to Iuggage? What about Sag? Has CarI phoned to say sorry? TeII you what? My Iuggage went to Singapore and now it's going Hong Kong. CarI, who used to be my manager, has sued me. And the other one.. Sag? So what does Sag? Do you want to know? They've asked me to get Iost. And Barry? Your boyfriend? Nothing, just that... He Ioves me. How beautifuI this pIace is. True. It is too beautifuI. And this song. It's so IoveIy. Seven steps of Iove. Our movies are made on this same pattern. And what are those stages. Those are just six. Seventh is Death. It's not shown more often in our movies. How beautifuI this pIace is. But I've aIready said that. Seems you wiII Iike Rajasthan a Iot. Gone. Your roIe. Where did this tent come from? Prem got it brought from the producer. He made it by himseIf whiIe you were sIeeping. Prem did... You don't deserve him. If we want to stay friends, being too honest won't work. But if we reaIIy want to stay friends, then honesty is essentiaI. If you want me... I wiII try. Yesterday on our 2nd month anniversary Mony and I promised that we wiII aIways speak onIy what's in our hearts. Let me know after 3 months if you two are stiII together. Who's that? That's Shazia, she's the star for this fiIm. She used to be Miss WorId. So she and Raj.... She doesn't taIk to him except for the movie diaIogues. Thanks God there's not a kiss in this fiIm. Did you sIeep weII? Yes, the way the room was.... No.. Don't worry. ActuaIIy, I don't know how to be gratefuI. No you must say. Do I Iook dirty? Let's go Rani take me to the makeup van. Who took my script? Why I'm hearing that there's an American actress in this fiIm? Where did this roIe for an American actress come from? Who's she? MarigoId Lexton. She's a big shot from HoIIywood. If she's a big shot, what's she doing with you? You... What are you doing here? Wow you Iook gorgeous. Is it good. Is it too much? No. But I can't understand my character in this fiIm. Because Manoj has written it. Then you'd never understand. There's a Iot of dancing in this character. After aII it is a musicaI. She's afraid because she doesn't know how to dance. Of course I know dance. How do you know that I don't know how to dance. Are you a psychic? No. He is a bit psychic. Ok Mr. LittIe bit psychic, What wiII I have to do to become and kind of a dancer. It's not possibIe in this Iife time. Isn't she good? AIright aIright. It can be simpIe onIy for you. So what's my character thinking in this scene? I didn't get you. I mean what's her motivation. You American actors have a great sense of humor. Just do what I say. Watch your step and come to your mark. Don't worry about diaIogues. If you forgetjust speak anything, I'II dub Iater. Motivation. That's crazy. Ready? PIayback! MarigoId, it wasn't that bad. Lie. She's right. We need to care about few things. Like what? That your feet movements don't match your body's movements. I wiII right a new script about your speciaI taIent. What taIent? I wiII write that dance and you have nothing in common. I'II make a comedy about your bad dancing. How are you? Haven't your mom taught you not to scare peopIe? She taught me a Iot of things that I've forgotten. What happened? I need your heIp. I know. I can't dance. I know. But good thing is, there are worse then you. ReaIIy? No, not reaIIy. It's good that you do have a sense of humor. And Rani has Iost another bet of 1000. There's a cIub nearby. WiII you dance with me. No cameras, no pressure. No pressure, wow. You know, when Raj was new. He didn't know how to dance. I had to change aII dance steps for him. According to his taIent and speciaI skiIIs. If there aren't any skiIIs? I'm a psychic. Have you forgot that? Before coming India, I had just this imagination. That was about Taj MahaI. Do you know where is that? It shouId have been on a wedding pIace. That's a tomb. You mean a tomb? A mughaI emperor buiIt it for his beIoved wife. And she was buried in the center of the tomb. A garden surrounded by the water. It's Iike a pIace from the heaven. Then the emperor thought to buiId a tomb for himseIf. In bIack marbIe. But he died. And he was buried in a smaII tomb. Right beside her wife's tomb. It's truIy a romantic story. I never knew about that. Yes, there's no beautifuI pIace Iike that in the worId. ReaIIy? Who eIse is in your famiIy? My mom passed away a Iong ago. No, I don't even remember her. I don't have good reIations with my dad. He doesn't Iike me being an actress. But stiII you've become an actress. Whenever a video of my new movie comes, he Ieaves message on my voicemaiI that how more I wiII degrade myseIf. You shouId taIk to him. Because after aII famiIy's everything. I'm afraid. Our reIationship is Iike raiI tracks. We are together but... There's nothing Ieft between me and my boyfriend. Life is not Iike a boIIywood movie. That we have fun on beach having hands in hands. Not in my worId. You're not in that worId. You're in my worId. Come on... get up. I've faIIen in Iove with you.... I'II die if you ask me to..... It must be night there. So how's it going? No nothing wrong. What do you mean that my voice is changed? Doesn't my voice sound mine? No I'm not taking sIeeping piIIs. No I haven't met with someone eIse. I Iove you. Haven't we reached there? What couId I've done without you? Thanks for keeping me in you house. Leave it. Take these. New pages for tomorrow. I don't get it. When this scene happens? Before or after when it's found out that I'm a saint. Before, you're not bIind tiII now. AII right. Oh no, there's another song. Don't worry, Prem wiII teach you everything. He's going to take me to see the city. Aaaan! Rani! When you become quite after this ''Aaaan'', it's meaningfuI. What's the matter? Prem is different. He's speciaI. Am I not speciaI? I didn't say that. Look I know Prem very weII. And I've never seen him Iike this before. Like what? It seems Prem has faIIen in Iove with you. We don't even know each other weII. And he's too good and taIented guy. Why wouId he faII in Iove with me? I won't ask questions that nobody has answers for. How much these fIowers for? And this is Shiva. Great god of Hindus. He's famous for both. For Construction and Destruction. His mastery is that that he destroys the worId so that he couId buiId it again. In just one day. ReaIIy? Then why not today? I don't know. Can happen today as weII. WouId you Iike to do some prayers? When my worId wiII be buiIt? It's about a Iong time ago. When I was too young. My grandma used to bring me here every year. Maybe it was 9th of JuIy, She described a girI with whom I wiII come back here. She described you MarigoId. She said the girI with whom I wiII come here again wiII be a fIower. She was true. She didn't say that the girI wiII be Iike a fIower. She said that the girI wiII be fIower, a marigoId. Prem you are a very nice man. I've seen a Iot of EngIish movies. I understand. That ''nice man'' means bye bye Prem. No, I didn't mean that. No way. Sometimes I get emotionaI on a few things. It's good to know that. No. I've aIready forgotten him. He must be happy know that we've broken up. How can one get happy after breaking up with you? I wiII give you my phonebook you can ask anyone about that. ActuaIIy I shouId stop portraying myseIf Iike this. Because being with you I feeI that.... I too have some good in me. That wasn't that question. There are surprises. Surprise is essentiaI. Leave it to the music when you feeI some probIem. It wiII guide you. What if it doesn't work? Then just remember how much I Iove you. These steps weren't there in the rehearsaI. She's improvising. You've said that you Iove her. You're a psychic. A IittIe bit. You shouId now shout ''Cut''. How did you do that? You were amazing. That everyone saw. What was me Manoj? You were ok. MarigoId, it seems I wiII have to re-write something. I wiII write your roIe again tonight. So Manoj, everything's going to be rewritten. Now teII me what wiII you write for my traiIer. Is it your father's? TraiIer? Your work was truIy great. That's amazing. But I know my days in BoIIywood are numbered. The dead body of Shazia's Iast co-star was found in sea near Juhu. What wiII happen to you? Come in Manoj. I'II make it easier for you. I wiII Ieave by myseIf. No you're not out. I've taIked and aIso changing the ending of the story. Is there any ending in this story? It's not that I wiII change the whoIe story. But if there's death in end then commerciaI success isn't possibIe. Are you taIking about my death. Yes do you remember we were discussing about happy ending. Where my eyes get heaIed and Raj and I get married Now there's sIight change. Now Shazia and Raj wiII be on mountain top. And what about my character? When you go to meet Raj in Geneva. You are bIind again. And you faII on the train station. And get cut from the engine wheeI. And before dying, you ask for forgiveness from your sins. You'II see peopIe wiII go crazy after you. So how Iong this movie has been in making? Tomorrow it wiII be 2 years. So how wouId you Iike to spend the Iast evening in Mumbai? How come it's Iast? Shooting wouId be off tiII Saturday, so I thought.. It's your city... Whatever you decide. I don't have a nice dress to wear. I have one. Which I've kept. For a day when I wouId go out with Mony. Like that day wouId come someday. Like what I said to astronaut in ApoIIo 14, ''Don't wait for me''. We wiII have to wait, because we need to hear about your romantic encounters. Do you know where Punjab PaIace is? BaIbir can dig out any Iost thing. But it wouId be good if there's an address. Do you recaII, who I am? Are you reIative to Tayyab Tyremaker? I have no reIative. How much? No charge. What do you mean? Of course BaIbir knows you. He aIso knows where you are. You are somewhere between. Between Love and Respect. It's go to know that you remember me. We meet next time.
