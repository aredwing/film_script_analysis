I'll smile when I find what I'm looking for. - Uh, uh, uh, uh. - So what you do you do, Victor? - Vincent. - Vincent Esquivel, right? - I'm a messenger. - Oh, is that God calling? - It's my cousin. So, is it Lucy like Lucia, or Lucy like Lucille? - More like Lucifer. I'm going to go get our stuff. - She's funny. - That's Celestina. It's Luzy, with a Z. - So kind of like Lucy and kind of like Luz, like the light that will shine my path. Oh shit! They're looking for you! So what do you make of it? - You designed this. Why make something so sad? - The only cure for the blues is to sing them. Who's that? - Sorry, it's um, it's my boyfriend. It was good meeting you, Vincent. - It was inspiring. Wait! How can I find you? - I'm a tattoo artist. - Hey fool, what's up with those sounds? - I could hear that paisa noise from down the street! I bet you were rain dancing. - Those who dance are considered insane. - By those who can't hear the music! - Hey. Who's that? - Uh, a potential client. - I like that. Always on the hustle. Time to start making a return on my investment, huh? - Hey Pete, Luzy's shop opened a month ago. They don't even have a sign yet, okay? So like Calmate! - Put your seat belt on. Bits and pieces fill our minds We dwell inside a space of freedom and escape From the world and its chains Shifting shapes and twisting... - Hey, I was on my home and just came by to drop off your key.

It seems to me that you two have some affairs to settle. And I have nothing to do with that. I'm going back outside to enjoy my evening. - Officers going to gentleman's club tonight. - Uh, I can't. Have to play the boyfriend tonight, but I'm on for tomorrow. - What's up, Pete? - You know, just taking a break from busting chumps. - Oh look out. - Ah take it easy.

In custody. - Who? - Edgar Fuentes. - From high school? - Who would've thought? Pointdexter would end up with a rap sheet. - Well what did he do? - He got into a wrestling match with one of our officers at a rally. - A wrestling match. You mean he got pinned to the ground. - He used to have a thing for you, right? - No, I wasn't even on his radar. - Worked out for me! I'll drink to that. - I'm good. I actually have to head back to the shop. I have a client waiting for me. - Come on, you're going to turn down sake? - Share it with Hiroki. - Gracias. - Well, thank you, Hiroki. - She has talent. You, you pay. - You know Pete, I'm going to be busy today, but why don't you come by my place tomorrow when you get off of work. - Sounds like a plan.

The fish's name was Tamashi. - Soul. - Yeah, Soul in Japanese. My grandmother's name was Alma. Both my grandfather and father have passed away, but Tamashi still lives with me. Oh, he's gotta be over 70 years old. You painted that? - I met Sofia last night. She had a conversation with me about Mr. E. - Where? - At the bar, she was there. She talked to me in the restroom. - Is that why you dissed me? Sofia's my ex! We've been broken up. - You know what, I don't care. I just don't want to get caught up in the middle. - Look, Luzy, I'm feeling you. If you don't want me to, you have to stop looking at me like that. - Clara Bow here told me you brought a over last night. - Yeah. They play a killer cover of Ojitos. - I heard. I haven't seen a serenata since I was a kid in Nayarit. - I just met you three days ago. - How about you play a song before you leave? You just gotta do whatever you feel like But life doesn't go - You should go. As planned I want to listen to it by myself. You learn from mistakes you make But you just gotta hold out - Hello? Hey baby. - Were you sleeping? - I came to bed early tonight. Want to come join me? - No. I want to talk to you about something. - Do you want to come over for lunch tomorrow? - No. You don't have to make anything. - I'm not making it just for you. You know I gotta eat too. It's my lunch break. It's gonna be good though. Just the way you like it. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. See you tomorrow. - Yo, Erik. Let's go blow some shit up. - I'll call the maestro so he can wait for us. - Yeah? Okay, yeah. I'll meet you at base, we'll take one car. Perfect. - So, Sofia's tripping out, man. - Really? I mean, she's fly and all but sometimes she does have that scandalosa twitch in her eye. - Yup. - So, what's up with Luzy? - Can't help but head toward the light. - Sorry we're late, Ron. - I was leaving when I finished my cup. Good thing I was sippin' slow. - Drinking the hard stuff? - Strong, son, strong! So, how are the crying clowns hanging? - Strong, Ron, strong! - Listen, I've been meaning to ask, is this some sort of heartbreak blues? - Definitely blues. No honey in my life blues, no money in my pocket blues, I done fucked up blues. - Sounds like you got them prowling blues! - Yes, he does. - Good God, Ron. - Ooh, I feel ya. Well, I'm gonna leave you two at it because if I come in any later, I will be drinking that hard stuff. You know the drill. Hasta la pasta, my muchachos! - There you go, you got it. - Thanks, Ron. - See you. - Come on in, it's open. Hola chulo. You're a little early. Let me boil some pasta so we can eat. - Sofia, we need to talk. - What's up? - We can't see each other anymore. - What? Are you serious? Are you being funny? We can do whatever we want. And we do! Isn't that the agreement? - I met someone. - When? - A few nights ago. - A few nights ago, like Monday night? The same night we slept together? - You know who she is. I don't want to play any games. - Are you sure? It looks like someone's playing you. - Look, I don't want this to end like this. I don't want to fight with you. - Then leave. - Sofia... - I said leave! You better leave before there's an accident. - But a woman's scorn. That'll put any man on the run. - How'd you know? - Magic. Let's take a break. - I've been drinking longer than you can remember. In my case though, I'm guilty. I admit it. - What happened? - I was banished. Lost all my friends. My band. - What'd you do? - I betrayed a Chicana princess. I understand it. They had to choose between the two of us. She was the life of the party. I was just a Mexicano. I miss those songs though. I miss that music. - Like you said, it's all about containing it. After you've gone And left me cryin' After you've gone There's no denying You feel blue, you feel sad You miss the best you've ever had There will come a time When you'll regret it There'll come a time And you won't forget it Some day when you grow lonely Your heart'll break... - Luzy. Like mine and your one and only After you've gone, after you've... - I'm home. Gone away. Someday - Hey. You will grow lonely Your heart'll break like mine and your one and only After you've gone - Do you want something to drink? - Yeah, I'll have some water. After you've gone away After you've gone, after you've gone, Away - What's up? - So um, so Pete. - This is bullshit. - There's nothing like this music to keep the demons at bay and the spirits high. - There's gotta be another way out. - Well if you know, let me know. - Yo, E-Dog. What it be? - Yo, Vincent. - Yeah. - Can you hear me? - Yeah. - Dude, I'm watching your ugly mug on TV right now. - What? - Channel 12. - Good afternoon, I'm coming to you live from the scene of the vandalism. It is Sofia Espinoza's daycare center. And as you can see, there are disturbing images that have been put up on the wall. And uh, we've got upset children and as you can imagine, very very concerned parents. Miss Espinoza, we've been told that you were able to see the culprit as he ran away. - Yes, I was able to get a good look at him and I actually sketched a likeness of him. - Wow, that's very good. That's almost like a photograph. - I took art classes in college. Oh, and I was able to get a good look at his car, he was driving an '87 White Chevy truck and I've got the license plate. - Well, here you go folks. The license plate number is 4H85373. Now if you see this truck, you should call the police hotline. That's 213-555-7447. Thank you very much Miss Espinoza. - You're welcome. I hope you catch him. - Hello officer. - How's it going? - Hey, that Miss Espinoza is well put together. - Yeah? I can put in a good word for you if you want. - I'll think about it. - Just go straight to the end of the cul de sac. - Okay. - I'll be back in one minute, okay? - Fuck. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. Gotta stay low. - You can stay with us tonight. My sister's having a for her birthday tomorrow. There's going to be a lot of Mexicans. You'll blend right in. - Hey Lobo, can I ask you for one last favor? - Why do you want me to sit here? I've said all I can say. - Just close the door. Open the glove box. - Pete, you only listen to what you want to. When I said I would never wear diamonds, I meant it. - I'll take it back. - It's not just the ring I'm turning down. I'm exhausted, I have to go. I have to get back to the shop. - Shit, man. - Luzy. - Vincent. What's up? - I'm calling to tell you not to believe anything you hear about me. My work is getting some bad press. - Bad press is better than no press, right? Make the most of it. - Yeah, but it's also bringing some heat my way. - You're not the type to buckle under pressure, though, are you? - I'm Vincent Esquivel. I'm in my prime. - Alright prime, tell me then why you're breathing so hard. - Because that's how I feel about you. - Pete! - This stupid clown again? - No, Pete, stop, stop, leave him alone! Leave him! It wasn't him, it's not him. - He's a cop! What's wrong with you? - He's a fucking cop? What's wrong with you? - Just get out of here. - You're not leaving me for that punk. You'd lose everything. What can he give you? - She's not going to want to see you anymore. - Why make something so sad? - They say the cure for the blues is to sing them. - I've done wrong blues. - We're in a mess. - Deal with it now blues. - You know, tattoos are also public art. - Not all of them. Just like the leaves Fall steady from the trees Slipping slowly away Drifting from day to day - I think I'm going a little mad. - Are you with me? - Yes. - Good. Then come inside and have some coffee. - Thank you. - I did not sign up for this shit. - I know, man. You guys haven't even kissed and they already knocked each other out. - What the hell? - Thanks. - You feeling better? - I gotta get out to the ocean. - Let's have a no dudes night tonight. - I'm all for that. You've had enough of spite and pain No use for lies or skies of gray No need to dwell in darkest days Just leave it all behind And fall right into life with me - Thank you. Oh, happy birthday. - Gracias. So how do you know Lobo? - Well, I met him at a bar and he helped me get away. - You're a criminal? - No. I'm an artist. - Oh. So draw me something. - Ok. Let me see your hand. Right here. - Because we're looking for inspiration. - Ah. So that's the answer. And the problem. - Wow. This is a party! Who are all these people? - It's about love. Love reminds us that we're human. That we should care. That we should smile at one another when we walk by. It's very simple. - Wow. This is beautiful. - Are you crying? - I'm inspired. - Good. - This is Luzy. Leave a number and I'll get back to you. - Luzy. I'm sorry, Luzy. I wish you were here with me. I know I fucked up. I wasn't there to fight your boyfriend. I just wanted to see you. I have a lot of work to do. - Yes you do. - I'll figure it out. Thank you guys. Thanks. Life feels real again. And I like that. We only really get the time we need. So, I understand if you never want to see me again. Thanks for shining the light, Luzy.
