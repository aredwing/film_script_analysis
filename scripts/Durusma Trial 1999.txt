I want to draw attention to this. The media's attention too. The matter is important. The defendant has a health problem. He couldn't get an erection and enter sexual intercourse with his wife... ...until the day he left home. My client is still a virgin. This has been proven by factual evidence. Your honor, they are insulting my manhood! Shame on you! This girl... Yes, she's still a girl. She divorced from her first husband with the same reason. Was he impotent too? Your honor! Order please! Write down. It is the order of this court... ...that the ex husband of the plaintiff Nazan Korkmaz... ...Cavit Durak is listened to as witness... ...and the case... ...postponed to 8.10.1999... ...10 o'clock. Insulting his manhood? Bandit. You should ask me. Quiet mom or a fight will break out. Let's remain calm. The media wants to provoke a fight. -Did you hear? -I did. Nazan, try not to talk much. They're coming. God damn them. They wasted my girl. She couldn't live her youth. Mrs. Nazan, a few questions? Sure but short ones. You see that she's pretty stressed out. -Mrs. Nazan, will you perform? -Ask my lawyer. Maybe. There are proposals but right now we're not considering. Did you receive an offer for TV serials? There are many offers, we're evaluating them. Mrs. Nazan must first read the scenarios and like them. My daughter deserves everything. I raised her like a flower but... -...she has bad luck. -Mom, cut it. Are you thinking of a third marriage? Why shouldn't she? She's still young. Where's a suitable husband for her? There's a shortage of men! Thank you very much. We're gonna have a press conference. That mother of her.. I'm going to shoot her. She screwed us. I'm going to shoot both of them. Right here. Don't be a child. Their lawyer is guiding them. That cunning bastard. I'm going to shoot him too. You know what bothers me most? Cavit will hear these and get overwhelmed with joy. You get what you deserve. Selami got divorced too. Yet he's still pompous. Look at that face. You should have been man and done your duty. -Don't talk like that! -To hell with your fish. Did I say something wrong? Shut up! What's it to you with our manhood? She left them. Hope you'll recover. What's that supposed to mean? Am I ill? They're here. Can we ask some questions? Dear friends, that's enough for today. As you see... ...Mrs. Nazan is very tired. She needs some rest. Well, if it's a short one, why not? Sevinc, who's that? Her lawyer. That's a handsome man. They look very close. Maybe she's done it with him. Could be mom. She's about to fall in him. The TV people are here to. They are famous now. We'll always have close contact with the press. Thanks. Is it over Necla? No way. This has taken too long. The judge decided to listen to Cavit... ...her ex husband. Why don't you go and tell everything? Come in Mr. Rafet, I'm sorry for the mess. -Can I offer you a coffee? -Yes I'd like to. Soon you'll have everything. Nazan will live in villas. I hope so. Idiot. Some get divorced from their second husband. You couldn't find even one. Take this. This thing has really worn you up. Hope you'll get over with it soon. -They are bitches. -Shut up. Am I wrong? We're full man. Forget about being a man Enver! Dilber Basak said ''I'm married for Hey, old fart! Are you joking? What joke? I'm just reading the paper. To hell with your paper. Get out of here. -How can you dismiss customers? -Customers like you I can throw out. Get out! Come on Mr. Rasim. He's pissed off. Never mind. Close the shop! I don't want no customers. We're closed today. We have a funeral. Turn off the TV. Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Your guy is coming. Just a second. Easy come. Thanks. -Did you hear? -What happened? The case is not closed. To hell with that case. What's it to us? The judge wants to listen to you. Me? What does he want from me? -As witness. -Witness? What am I supposed to say at court? It's been 2 years since the divorce, still I couldn't get rid of them You're a grown man. Am I supposed to tell you what to do? There's someone from the TV in the car. Wants to talk to you. What does he want to talk about? Just a small conversation. They asked for it. Welcome. Your picture has been published in yesterdays Hurriyet. -Have you seen it? -What's there to see? I'm embarrassed. Close the door. Put the chain on. Close the curtains. Enough! Don't let anyone in. I don't want any reporter or journalist. Turn off the TV. There's the news. I told you to turn it off. From now on you won't step out of the house. We're leaving this neighborhood. Don't be mad. How can you leave the hood because of a girl? Shut up! I gave my decision. It's over. We're going. I have some misfortune. I'm at the mercy of that Cavit prick. What will Cavit tell the judge? God damn him. Let him tell whatever he likes. Nothing will change the decision. It will end in this session. Hope so. Filthy bitch, god knows what she's up to again. Auntie, don't harass her. She'll put on a fight. Talk polite. -What was I going to say? -You forgot again? -Witch. -Mom, shut up. She'll hear. I don't mind. I don't fear anyone. What will that nerd tell now? Never mind. His statement can influence the case. -Go and find out. -I won't talk to that prick. You won't die. Just say hello. Sure. He makes a false move I'm going to kill him. We're in the court and surrounded with cameras. Shall I talk? Hey, look. I don't want to attack you but are you going to tell everything? Why? You think I'm lying? -I didn't mean that. -What did you mean? I mean... Very honest and direct? Like a man. What did you say? Man? Somebody stop me! Like a man ha? You mean I'm not a man. Calm down or I'm going to beat you up. Mom, I'm scared. You don't have to. You're going to get rid of these... ...monstrous, primitive creatures. Plaintiff Nazan Korkmaz, her representative Rafet Titiz. Defendant Selami Korkmaz. his representative Recep Sanli! Yes. We're here. Quiet please. Show yourself. What is he going to ask? How shall I know? The judge called you. You're going to tell everything. Stay here. You sorcerer. I wish you dead. Let's be quiet. Is the witness Cavit here? He's here your honor. Hurry up! Stay there. Incompetent fool. I wonder what he's going to tell. Oksan, look at them. They look like they've come for revenge. -Name? -Cavit. -Last name? -Durak. -Father's name? -Salih. -Date of birth? -14th June, 197 4. You know both parties? Yes. Do you have any blood ties with them? No. Will you swear to tell the truth? Yes. Tell everything you know about the case. You've been married to the plaintiff Nazan Korkmaz? Yes, sir. Unfortunately we got divorced. Don't unfortunate me. The court has decided that because... ...you didn't fulfill your duty as husband within 365 days... Don't talk about my manhood. This got nothing to do with it. Answer my questions. Sorry. ...you should be divorced from Nazan Durak... ...with the 28.06.97 dated decision of Kadiky 2. Court. Yes sir. We got divorced, unfortunately. Do you know Selami Korkmaz? Unfortunately yes. Cut that unfortunately crap. Nazan Korkmaz wants to get a divorce... ...from Selami Korkmaz, due to the same reason. I got nothing to say to that. I've shown the court at that time and I can proudly show again... ...my manhood is proven by doctor's reports. Excuse me. He is misleading. I want to show you while the press is here. What do say to this? We have a doctor report stating that Nazan Korkmaz is virgin. That's impossible! They pulled a trick on us. Two strong men. Let's say I couldn't do her. He couldn't too? Objection. My client is virgin. This is the report. You can look if you want. Let's not indulge in our complexes. Let's be objective. Sit down! Don't talk without given permission. You're not in a coffeehouse. Cavit. Yes your honor? What do you say to that? You both don't let anyone talk about... ...your manhood, yet there is official report stating that Nazan Korkmaz's... ...hymen is intact. How could that be? Unfortunately it happens. There's something wrong there. Selami, Nazan and me are from the same neighborhood. Our parents know each other. We were together in primary school and middle school. Nazan was at that time my girl. What made you think I was your girl? No, she was my girl. They can't talk about my client like that. I want to draw the attention of the valuable press members. She's under a heavy psychological pressure. She was my girl. Everybody knows it. Selami had a hung of her too but he wasn't serious. Everyone in the hood knew we were going too marry. Selami was showing interest in her to piss me off. After I came back from the army we went to ask for her hand. Well done my girl. Thanks my child. Slow down, you'll burn your mouth. Let it. This coffee should be drunk while it's hot. It's delicious. Well, who made it? Yes, how shall we do it Necla? Let's wait until next week for the engagement. You're no stranger. Thanks. What shall I say... She has another suitor. Again that guy? Well, if it's in her destiny... Aunt Necla, do we know that suitor? No, you don't. He's not from around. Let's make a decision. The kids like each other and are in love. So it is but, it would be very nice if the groom had his own job. My shop is his. He knows about fishery. Yes but it's not very pleasing to say the groom is a fisher. What's there to it as long as you work honorable? Let me tell you in first place, I won't let my only child leave. They're going to live here with me. Thank god we have a big house. What do you say? All right. It doesn't matter for me. Let's go then. Come son. Why dad, we were sitting. See you next week. Hope so. If nothing happens. If fortune wills. I'm her fortune mom. Good-bye. Get inside. Don't look so stupid. Wash the cups. Hi Cavit, how are you? Fine, and you? Where are you going Safiye? What's up? Something good. For Selami. So? We're going to ask for Nazan. I decided to marry. It's hard being single. Each night with another babe.. I'm bored. So you are that suitor? Go and ask! You'll get her. We'll see who will get what. Is that bum also seeking for her hand? Why didn't you tell me? From now on I'll shoot anyone who'll look at Nazan. For your information, we'll get married soon. They agreed to give her to me. My mother-in-law is a precious woman. She said ''I will give you my daughter my eyes closed.'' Bravo. Yes. She's a very decent woman. She told me to prepare my suit. Why is Cavit so certain? He'll get nothing. You think my mother-in law gives her to a fisher? Who's Cavit anyway? She said ''Let's wait till next week Selami. I happened to promise them.'' So it's a deal? It's done. We're getting engaged next week. ''The prime minister said the mafia is finished and added... ... ''I don't want anything for myself.'' Cavit will get furious. Let him! Selami, your would-be-wife is at the window. Saffet. One bread, one kilo sugar, six eggs. Hurry up Ziver. Bring her six bread, 10 kilos sugar and 40 eggs. Don't take any money. I'll pay Saffet later. Oh babe. Thanks very much. You're welcome. Tell him I'm grateful. You bum! So you were spying on us? Yes she sent me a kiss. How is that Cavit? Selami says ''They gave the girl to me.'' He's lying. Friday you'll see who gets the girl. Is her mother pulling something off? Don't talk like that about my mother-in-law. My mother-in-law doesn't pull anything off. Alright, I got it. You're not good to talk to. Give me my fish. I got things to do. Here. You're going to have a wedding? He'll want. He's our only son. -Don't you have things to do? -All right, I'm going. Bon apetit. This is from the side. Very soft. You can drink a big bottle of raki and won't even feel it. You got the necklace? Don't take it out. My father shouldn't see it. Don't give that to the girl. It's expensive. -Did you exchange the Marks? -Yes I did. Well, it's up to you. Why? Selami has finished everything. I saw it with my own eyes. She sent him kisses and he sent stuff to their house. What are you talking about? I swear it's true. You're my friend. Would I ever lie to you? Forget that girl. Dad, look what he says! Is Selami not here? He went to buy a wedding suit. -Why were you looking for him? -I'm going to kill him. Fine. What? -You're going to kill him?! -Yes. Bring us two tea. I rented the wedding hall. It's going to be a fabulous wedding. Just to make that nerd furious I'll have a band play at Nazan's door. My mother-in-law couldn't wait until Friday. She made up her mind. I have a wedding dress for my Nazan. I sent tailor Mualla to her. Man chopped friend who wed his beloved to pieces I'm going to chop you too. Is my Nazan gone? Nothing's gone. Don't upset yourself. We'll talk on Friday. That son of a bitch has already made a wedding dress for her. Dad. She'll be mine! I've heard. Don't bray. I said we'll talk on Friday. Then, your honor, my parents went there to talk on Friday. Nazan's mother decided I'd be a decent husband and gave her to me. Selami had a heart attack. We got the girl. Is it true? I couldn't wait either. I fainted of joy. We started the preparations right away. Selami was so jealous. Marriage is so hard. We make a dress, her mother doesn't like it. I get a suit my father hates it. We make a wedding party, the guests don't like it. Cut it short! Tell us about your marriage. What happened that night? Unfortunately nothing. I couldn't even touch her. Let's go to our room Nazan. Don't rush. My mother's doing preparations. I can't wait. Come kids. May God make you happy. May you grow old in the same bed. I'm scared mom. Don't be stupid. What's there to be afraid of? We all have done it. This is your best day. Come on. Come on sweetheart. You wait here mom. I'm waiting. You wait here. If you need anything, call me. Turn of the light. Why? Very rude. How come? You're my official wife. Honey, my Nazan. Thank God we're married now. I've waited for this day so long. Don't Cavit. Very nasty. Don't touch me like that. Why do you behave like this? Now that we're married do we have to do it? Do what? You know. Kissing and... What are the days for? Sit down and let's talk. What talk? Did we come here to talk? Of course. There's so much we can talk of. Undress my dear. I'm going to call my mom. I was betrayed. But it wasn't Nazan. That bitch got me. Her mother. Don't drink so much. What did the doc say? To hell with what he said. I'm burning inside. Are they sleeping now? Never mind what they do. Never mind? You call yourself a friend. He shall not touch that girl. I'll break his arm! How can anyone to her such a bad thing? Alright folks. Let's move. It's twelve o'clock. The municipality is giving fines. We'll pay Cezmi. Don't stress us. We're talking. He can't. The Cavit I know won't be able to do anything. You'll see. I promise you. He won't be able to do it. You remember? You and I were playing hide and seek when I was 11. You always scared me. One time you climbed on a tree... ...and jumped on me yelling ''boo''. My lips got herpes. My mother took me to a hodja. I never forget. You were such a freak. You still are. Where am I? You're sleeping. What time is it? Almost six. Undress. Shame on you Cavit. You can't do it during daytime. So when? What are you, a Serbian monster? Don't. Don't get closer. I'll call my mom. Mommy. I'm not leaving without doing it. Mommy! Shut up! Are you nuts? Mom! Hurry up mom! Cavit, don't. Help! Save me! I swear I'll jump. Don't shout. Get down! The neighbors will hear. Yeah. Then you'll kiss me! Of course I will. I have to, don't you see. Get down. What's going on? He's killing the girl. What wedding? He can't hear and makes things up! He's strangling Nazan. Oh my! He's killed the girl. Thief? Where? Where's the thief? I'll kill him! I swear he has killed the girl. Selami, hurry up! Get that killer! He's killing my Nazan? Let me go! Give me water! Open the door! I'm going to strangle you with my own hands. What's going on here? It's early in the morning. Are you crazy? Nazan.. is she dead? Why should she? She's in her husband's arms. They're sleeping. Sleeping? In his arms? They're holding each other. Good morning. Thanks. You too. Good morning dad. Good morning. Why did you come son? Why shouldn't I? They are different things. Did you get no sleep last night? You can say so. We won't be able to look at anyone's face. What do think you're doing? He attacks me, what can I do? It's not attacking. He loves you. What kind of love is that? He scares me to death. Don't be afraid. He won't eat you. He may. That's how men are. First days anxiety. You'll get over it. Relax. Close your eyes. Not now you idiot. Tonight. You must do it tonight. That's all I say, all right? Yes. Turn of the light. Don't start again. Turn it of and come next to me. I'm closing my eyes. Why? My mom told me. I said turn of the light. Why are you looking as if you're gonna eat me? I'm gonna eat you. You're so sweet. You stink fish. I swear I washed myself 3 times. Don't touch me! How am I supposed to do it without touching? Since you mentioned touching I recalled something. Nazan, don't act like this. We're not here to play house. All right, I'm closing my eyes. But if you scare me... I won't. Aunt Necla. Give me cologne. Nazan fainted. To hell with you. Again? Your daughter is truly something Aunt Necla. Don't call me aunt. Step aside. You both couldn't get it right. What's the matter with you? Any news? Nothing's happened today too. Didn't I tell you? He won't be able to do it. He's not that man. Leyla, who called her husband impotent was shot No one can shoot my Nazan! I'll kill anyone who'll touch her. Are you nuts? He's just reading the paper. Don't. Read silent. What happened to Cavit? I can't see him around. He is depressed. I heard things. I don't know. I heard too. Don't take it serious. It is just rumors. How you doing? He acts as if I've screwed his sister. Since Nazan married Cavit, he won't greet me. What's he supposed to do? He's hurt. He doesn't get hurt. He's such a liar. I feel sad for Cavit. If the rumors are true... They are. How many month have passed? She should have been pregnant by now. Cavit is useless. Cavit, come sit. When you talk of some good person, he'll come by. What were you talking about me? We were saying ''He got married and forgot us.'' That's something else. I can't leave the shop. Could you give me a cut? Sit down for a while. Not now. In the evening. My father went to the fishery. Wait, I'm coming too. Such a healthy man but still he can't do it. What are they talking about me? Don't you get it. They say so and so. You believe them? No way. I have nothing to say to your manhood but... Do you fail? What are you doing? Don't get that anxious. You don't know anything. Nazan is ill. Mentally ill. She faints all the time. I don't know what to do. I will never get in the same bed with him. He attacks me. Doesn't look like it. Don't get fooled. He has two characters. He scratched me all over. God give me patience. What shall we do? I can't go on anymore. Are you nuts? Everyone will blame us. Where are you going Latife? To Zehra my dear. Necla is very worried. I've heard it too. Poor girl. Besides, he's beating her every night. Of course she wants a child. God spare us all. I don't want to upset you but what can I do? I'm just a messenger. His condition made me suspicious. He's in deep thoughts all the time. Let's hope the word doesn't spread out. It did already. I didn't tell anyone. I swear to God, I just talked to you. Necla doesn't know what to do. She just talked to me. How wise of her. Why doesn't she talk to me? What did we do to deserve this? How am I going to tell his father? When will you get a child Cavit? We're hoping. You should hurry up. You'd like to have a grandson don't you? There's no need to rush. Hurry up. What's this talk? Everyone says something. You want to disgrace us? It's not my fault. Nazan is sick. What do you mean sick? She's nutty. Nutty or not. She's still your wife, isn't she? It doesn't happen. How come? Can't you succeed? Well, I can't dad. What do you mean she faints? Do it even if she's unconscious. Yes, it just takes a minute. You can tie her hands. Yes, do it. Easy talk. Come and do it yourself. Do you think I don't know, what to do? Slow down Selami. Welcome kids. Good evening gentlemen. Let's sit here. Nice view. Send us Fikret. Fikret, serve them. Welcome. Where did that idiot come from? Never mind. I want ram's testicles. Big one. Those that are in demand in the neighborhood these days. I'm going to shoot him. Sit down. Don't get annoyed. He's drunk. I won't let anyone make remarks about my manhood. We don't let anyone talk. I dare them to. I'm confidently talking here. I'm a man. You think I'm a woman? Why are you offended? Gentlemen! Cool down! Selami sit down. Nobody is saying anything to you manhood. Can't we order any ram's testicles anymore? Do it as I say and finish it tonight. I surely will. Ram her. Forget about rams now. Alright. No rams. I didn't mean that. I rather die than become a gossip subject for Selami. Just finish it tonight and they'll stop talking. Close her mouth. I will. Tie her hands. I will. I dare her to run away. Where's she running? She runs away even from the chimney. She won't. Then do it. I will. Tonight her cherry will burst. Every night the same trick. You can't fool me. Open the door! I'm home. Nazan's husband! Open up! What the hell? Are you drunk again? I'm not drunk. Just had a few drinks. Take it easy! You're not in a barn! Whoa! Where's Nazan? What are you going to do to her? If I catch her... This is going to end tonight. She's sleeping. Wake her up! Leave her alone. That's what made me end up like this. I'll beg you don't harm her. I'll do it. I promised my dad. Don't rush on her like an animal. Gently caress her. Shut up! I know what to do. Nazan, stop pretending. Get up! What do you want? You know better. We'll get over it tonight. Don't say anything or I'll do you bad. You stink! You drunk! Don't rely on anyone tonight. Mom! He's killing me. Yell. Yell so that your mom rescues you. During our marriage, I didn't hit her once your honor. Liar! He's lying. He came home drunk every night. He's a sex maniac. She's a maniac, I swear. He was attacking my child every night. I'm sorry to say but one time he even tried to kiss me. God damn you. Dear members of the press. Let's remain calm. Or I'll order you out. Silence. You're in court. Sit down lady. Didn't I tell you not to speak without permission? We apologize your honor. Sit down please and calm down. The independent court will decide freely. You hear the cries of a mother who couldn't see her girl's happiness. The valuable members of the press should hear it too. These two psychopaths made my client ill. They made me ill. Our friend tells the truth. I required hospital care. They are both perverts. I'm sorry but they are mentally ill. The drama and cries of a mother and her daughter... ...should be recorded. I request the members of the media.. ...to expose these people. I'd like to draw attention to another brutality. The witness Cavit Durak has not fulfilled his duty as husband... ...neither physically nor mentally. Therefore he's gone insane and tried to set fire to his mother-in-laws... ...house and burn these innocent women. It's a lie. I swear. They knocked over the pan while frying fish. That's how the fire broke out! I'm burned! Nazan, hurry up! Mom, what happened? We're burning. Fire! Cavit. Damn it. To hell with your mackerel and goatfish. So what's with my fish? You couldn't even buy 2 kilos meat from the butcher with your money. Fire! They are burning! Fire! Mom, run. Nazan's house is burning! You don't say. Selami! Run. What's up sis? The hell is up. They are burning. Hurry up! He's burnt the girl. I'm going to burn you too. To hell with a son-in-law like you. Look at me. My mother got burnt while frying your fish. I got burnt too. I won't bring you fish no more. Nazan. You're alive. What the hell are you doing at my house? He came to help. I can't look anyone in the eye. I pity my son. To hell with your son. Couldn't do her in 9 month. Donkey! Have a talk with him. About what! He's not coming to the shop now for a week. Where the hell are you? Home. Home. How is home? Are you comfortable? Very. They are taking very good care of me. My mother-in-law tells me to drink at home. She brings me the bottle every night and prepares great appetizers. How's it going with your wife? Better. She doesn't run anymore from me. She's very gentle. So you did it? Not yet. This time something happened to me. I feel sleepy. Why are you not going to the shop? Your dad is looking for you. I can't without doing Nazan. I know dad will beat me. He started catching fish. He doesn't go to the shop anymore. As long as he stays away from you, it's fine. Are you pleased with your oven? Thank you very much. It's very easy. I'll buy you a dishwasher. Automatic. Thank you. How is the medicine? You've seen any effect? Very. He goes to bed early. If he does any bad let's increase the dosage. There's not much time left to your divorce. Did you investigate it thoroughly? What does the lawyer say? It's certain. He said ''When a husband doesn't fulfill his duties as spouse... ...the court divorces them. This made me feel better. Let me bring you cake. Don't go to any trouble. What trouble? I won't let you go without giving cake. How are you dear? He does not bother you anymore, does he? No. He's not that horny no longer. He's helpless. To hell with him. I don't want him to touch you. Increase the dosage. He's in a good mood tonight. Wanted me to fry the fish. Never mind! Stay calm. He can't even talk when he gets the medicine. I think it is overdose. I love your pilaki. I can do it every day if you like it. I sure do. Where's this Nazan? She'll come anytime. She's frying the fish. I want her sit facing me. I'll eat her tonight. Just like a mackerel. He should have slept by now. There's nothing wrong with the drugs, is there? No way. I gave 5 ampoules. What? If he gets all of them he'll die. Let him. No matter how much I drink I don't get drunk. I'm tough as a rock. You know how tough I am. No one can make me sleep. In bed, I'm a monster. Everyone in the hood knows it. All the women have tasted it. Come to my room. Coming. Right away. You know what I'm going to do. Let's call a doctor. Are you nuts? The lights went out. He's finally asleep. I almost died. I couldn't come to myself for 2 month. While I was in half-trance they applied to the court. Write down. ''I wasn't aware that the time was over.'' Unfortunately time was over. They got their divorce. He's slandering. I swear. Don't talk without being given permission. What can she do? These are the cries of a mother who couldn't see... ...her daughter's happiness despite two husbands. I'd like to draw the attention of the press. Don't state your opinion without permission. You got anything else to say? Yes, there is. Unfortunately we got divorced. And she married that guy in a short time. What's this? Isn't this rigging? Your honor. They married without rigging or tricks. They married on mutual consent. We're the injured part here. They're lying your honor. They speak as they please. Your honor. They are both looking for revenge. They both couldn't do as man. They spoiled it. She's insulting us. They're assaulting our manly pride. They made my daughter ill. We'll sue for damages. We want compensation from these monsters. She is ill. They made us ill. We should be suing them. I've waited for both of them. Order! Sit down. You too. I'll throw anyone out who talks without permission. Let's remain silent. Or else I will continue with a closed session. Stand up! Yes your honor? Nazan Korkmaz has filed divorce against you, on grounds that... ...you didn't fulfill your duties as husband. She's very decent. Her mother is evil. She put on every trick on us with her lawyer. He's telling the truth. I'm protesting these assaults on me and my client. I have a right to sue for insult. I'd like to have it recorded. Sit down. Write. Cavit Durak, who was married to Nazan Korkmaz... ...and failed his duties as husband has given testimony. Then the defendant Selami Korkmaz was given word. Of course I have. I'm very upset. They used magic on me. First we were very happy. I brought a band to the hood for her. Stop! What do you think you are doing? I won't stop. I'm going to disgrace them. You're going to fall! Let me. Maybe I'll fall on both of them and kill them. Bastard! I wish I had shot both of them. Is this your only line? That ass won't be able to do it either. He never can do anything... ...I couldn't do. It's over. From now on Selami is ruined. He'll turn out better entering a nut house than marrying Nazan. He'll have a miserable life. Let him! Cut it! He won't be able to do it. I know it. Let's move it. We're closing. What do you think they're doing now? Don't throw everything down. I don't like messiness. Don't bother Selami. We're married. We'll tidy up. Undress. You shouldn't look when a man gets undressed. Turn around.. Are you joking? What joke? My mother always said that she never saw my late father... ...undressing next to her. Alright. Hurry. Give me my pajamas. You were not to look! If the bride sees it the first day, it's bad luck for the groom. God, don't embarrass me this time. Turn of the light. Why? You're my husband, aren't you? Slow down. Don't do like that. I'm tickled. I'll eat you. Stop Nazan. Why do you rush? Let's talk. Were you flirtatious to that Cavit either? Forget Cavit. Hold me. I want you Selami. Don't. I'll tell you something. Were you tickling Cavit too? Did we come to talk about Cavit? I can't stop. I've waited too long. This girl is out of control. The thief is on a payroll? She's strangling him. The groom is dead. Who's there? He killed the girl. That's just a ball. Open. Nazan will die! I'm going to kill that murderer. What are you doing? What was that? Someone's fired a pistol. What do you want again? Did he kill her? Beat it! Drunk! I'll call the cops. Is Nazan dead? Why should she? She's sleeping with her husband. Sleeping? Are they doing something? Good morning. Did you want something? I was going to the bathroom. Go my dear groom. I prepared everything. Towels and underwear is inside. Thank you. I've caused you trouble. What trouble? Is Nazan asleep? She just slept. Let her sleep. Wake up. Brides don't sleep like this. Make breakfast for your husband. What's up mom? The hell is. I'm going to burst with curiosity. What happened? It didn't happen. I've tried hard. God damn you. Incompetent fool. Why do you hit me? Selami is very odd. Odd? Could he be ill too? The neighbors are waiting. They'll say the bride is ill. What are we going to do? Let's pour red ink. You didn't but someone did. Don't look for trouble. I'll cut you to pieces. Did I say something wrong? They've did it. Are you going to drive me nuts? What's up bum? They'll make me a murderer. Everybody says something. Let's move from this hood. Where to? Where can we find such a shop? I've heard something. What? Selami couldn't do her too. They're bringing him to a hodja. Didn't I tell you. Nobody can do that girl. I've no problem with my manhood. I know. Sometimes it happens and you loose your power. It's God's will. I hope nobody has seen us. They've started gossiping. As if I'm their only worry. Drink this. May God answer our prayers. May you recover soon. One in the morning, noon and evening. It will benefit you. Don't eat too much or it will get you wild. Miracles are the work of God. We're just his servants. He was really a powerful hodja. He gave me a paste and said... ...''This will finish your hesitation within 40 days. Then come again... ...and I'll do charm for a child.'' I've started eating the paste... ...but it had no effect. Besides it ruined my guts. My mother said they were using magic on me. Lie. It's a lie your honor. It's true your honor. They could do any wicked act. They are trying to cast shadow on our case. I'm sure the valuable.. ...press has noticed. This is the final struggle of these felons. Sit down! -Sit down mom. I swear the truth your honor. I've found black cumin seed in my pajamas pockets. He doesn't know what he's talking. Your honor, the defendant is displaying a degeneration. In front of the supreme court and press. These are the anxieties of a psychotic character. What about the cock's crest I've found under my bed? They let me known as impotent. What kind of a marriage is this? The neighbors wait in ambush, her mother waits at the door. Don't sleep Selami. I've promised my mom. Wake up! Everyone expects us to have a child. I have headache. I don't feel very well. Did the paste do no good? It didn't. It made me worse. God damn it. I'm sick of it. Come here you. My back! Enough! I'll kill myself. What are you doing? Stop! She's committing suicide. Run. Where's the thief? Don't run. Let go of me! Don't shout Nazan. Everyone will think something has happened. What could be worse than this? I'll kill myself. What are you saying? God forbid. You take yourself as man? Be careful! I'm pissed off already. I could do you harm. Mommy. Tell me child. I'm depressed. I want to cry. Cry my girl, it will relieve you. She fainted. Give me the cologne. Everyone's on the street. Does she regain consciousness? No. What did you do to her? Nothing. The hodja's were not useful. They won't. Didn't I tell you. They tear each other apart. Never laugh at other's misfortune. Selami is no good. He's exhausted. Don't look at his display. He's right. Or else she would have been pregnant by now. Why the hell did they come? Never mind. Let them. Order tea. Ziver, two tea! Ask about Nazan. Not now. Ask, why are you scared? I'm sorry for what happened. Thanks. Is your wife ill? It's not important. Just a little headache. Ask if she's pregnant. Don't you see how he looks? You want to die? Don't worry. There's nothing to afraid of him anymore. The woman who couldn't have a child from her husband in 3 years... ...has committed suicide. Are you my pain in the ass? I'll kill you all! Was there nothing else to read? What are you doing? Stop! Let me go! They are going to drive me nuts. Don't come here again. What's my wife's pregnancy to you? This marriage can't go on like this. Her heart throbs every night. She'll get a chronic disease. Go out Derya. We have to talk with Necla. I couldn't talk while your daughter was around. It would be very bad if I start talking. You made the boy look impotent. I swear I did tell no one. I swear to god. The neighbors are filthy. They make it up. Don't make me talk. I've had enough. Just speak out if you have to. You cast spells on my son. God forbid. I don't know nothing about spells. You sure know everything. You made him eat donkey's tongue. Who ever said that should drop dead. Did you hear? Selami's mom and Necla had a fight. May they turn worse. Where does it snow? -To Selami's mother's... Don't move or I'm going to cut you. What's he saying? They had a fight because of sorcery. You may not remember but once we has snow in April... You're still in the past? Selami is nuts. He's looking for charms everywhere. What's this? Black cumin. Black cumin. Who do you think you're fooling? You think I'd eat this? It scatters from the bread. Shut up you sorcerer. Don't talk to my mom like that. I can eat it too if you don't believe me. You can eat it. It doesn't effect you. What have you put in my meal? What could we put in it? Are you crazy. I'm crazy. You made me crazy. You should see a doctor. His mother is provoking him. Don't start with my mom. What? Why don't you hit? That's the only thing you know. What's that? Give it to me. Don't hide it. Just a hair. Hair. It's sorcery. What sorcery? It's one of your hairs. -You've ruined me. You've ruined me! Owl's peak. Black cumin. Rats tail. Donkey tongue. Sorcerers! Are you going to kill me or what? I have it all over me. This is enchanted too. God damn you all. I'll kill you all. There are charms everywhere. Another charm. What shall I do with you? I'm gonna burn this house! I'm going to burn them all. You bastards! I'll burn them or I'll be paralyzed. Run, he's wrecking the house. You filthy sorcerers. Selami if you're insane, pray to God. You've gone wild. I'll call the police. Shut up! Call them. Let them see your sorcery. What's this? Nazan's lucky charm. To hell with... I don't accept all cases. My friends in the media recommended me to take it. I've found your file very interesting. Your daughter's future is bright. She'll earn big money, get acquainted to millionaire businessmen. Just a sign to the media is enough. The TV stations will wait at your door just to have an interview. Did you hear? Yes I did. This is good fortune. I don't talk nonsense. This is certain. You can have much much more. I'm listening to you. Tell me every detail. Where should I start? We can't hold on anymore. He's nuts. Can't do his duty as man. He has ruined my girl. What a pity. How long are they married? It's been 11 month. There's not much left. We'll file divorce, hold on for a while. I don't know how. It's easy. You're going to used my tactics. Do you smoke? Let me take one. My head is about to burst. You? Smoke one. It will relieve you. She'll get tuberculosis from this. My dear. Those days are over. You're under my protection now. Thanks very much. How old are you Nazan? You're very young. You have a bright future ahead of you. I wish she'd get rid of this trouble. She will. Don't you worry. They will divorce in one session. Hope so. My girl couldn't find herself an appropriate man. She will. Men are the easy part. Nazan will play with them. As long as we get over this process without problems. God forbid. I'd never let him get close to my girl again. Mr. Rafet, you know our budget. How much is this going to cost us? Money is not important. I don't want anything from you. Just sign this contract. You'll pay me after the suit is over. I'll get forty percent of all your contracts. Stage, movies, TV. Is Selami at the coffeehouse? -He is. What's up? -Give this to him. -There's nothing bad here, is it? -No, let him read it. Mind your business. Cavit. -What's it? -Nothing. Asshole. What do you mean they don't open the door? You're her husband. There's 22 days. Crush the door. You have mail. From whom? Maybe he has no parents. There's no name. Remember me after 22 days. Where's she? What are you going to do? Get of my way! I'm going to do whatever I please. She's my wife. If you wanted to anything, you would have by now. Damn you. Get up. Your husband is here. Stop pretending. Yell if you dare. I'll show you what a man is in 14 days. Ghost! -Hi. -Look who's here. We missed you. Hair and beard cut. As you wish. There's a letter for you. Letter? Why does he send it to you? Does that ass not know my address? It's from an old friend. Give it to me. You have 8 days left. Hurry up. I'm going to kill you all. I'll kill you all. The whole neighborhood is here. Get up! What are you doing here at this hour? Be polite. We're sewing. You've waited for me didn't you. I don't buy this trick. Get up! I'll screw my wife. You don't know what you're talking about! You can't send anyone away. This is my house. And she's my wife. Sit down. Don't bother. And I will do it in front of you. Shut up or you gonna get it! Move. Let me go. Or I will shout! Shout! Who's going to rescue you? Why don't you pull a trick now? It's no use. What's going on? There's a family here. I pity him. This is his last day. I'll talk to him. Are you nuts? Sit down. He'll kill you. He won't do shit. Look at him. I don't mean anything bad. We've suffered from the same problem. We understand each other. Go and push her. Score in the last minute. We'll wait here till the morning. He's right. Move. I'm home. Are you asleep? Wake up! Don't be afraid, I won't do you harm. Let's separate friendly. I came to say goodbye. Aren't you going to kiss me? You bitch. Where's Nazan? -I don't know. She ran away. -Where to? You made her run. I swear I don't know. So? There's nothing to do. This is your luck then. What are you doing? The file has been studied. The case is over. Upon careful consideration... ...on evidence that the plaintiff Nazan Korkmaz is a virgin... ...the court decided to divorce her from Selami Korkmaz. There's a right to appeal. Justice has been carried out. Thank God! Your honor. I accept the law. I have a request. While everyone is present, I'd like to do her here if you permit. I'd like to thank our media on behalf of my client and on myself... ...for their interest in this human tragedy. My client is in shock. Her heart is beating like an injured bird. Will there be a press conference? In a few days. We will tell everything in detail. We'd like you to excuse us right now. Come on Nazan. Thanks. She's gone. -She is. You let her go. I told you, dumb ass. Talk polite. I'm pissed off. What if I don't? This is an unfair world. Yours has become famous. It's not my Nazan anymore. As if she cared. She's become rich. What's it to me? What's it to you? I'm sure other men are doing her. Regret your stupidity. You're the one who's stupid. Let's move gentlemen. I have a home too. All right. Don't stress us. She has a fine voice. Do you want to make me cry? Don't cry. What's gone is gone.
