But is now a sport. How many bullets can your gun hold? Wrong, it's 21 plus 1. Magazines can hold one more when loaded. A standard IPSC target. Zone A, 5 points; Zones B and C, 4. Zone D, 2 points. Are you ready? Stand by! Stop! Don't you know you backfired? Hit the most zones A's in the shortest time. Accurate shooting and no technical errors. Better your chances of winning. Many of you shot off-mark. The bullets far from each other. Hitting the same target in quick succession. Is called Double Tap. Only experts can do that. You can usually hear and tell. How's the alteration? All right. It's excellent. Don't point it at yourself. You're afraid it will backfire? Of course. What if it's pointed at you? Same thing. Why did you come? It's far, the food is bad. Miss you; I want you to meet someone. An old classmate wants to be your student. You're a gunsmith and dislike teaching. But if not you I'd have married him. Hello... I'm Vincent Ng, nice to meet you. I'm so happy... He's so nice. We're like old friends already. You won at your first match in 1991. No one could beat you after that. You injured your hand by accident in 1995. And have stayed away from competitions. But you're still very famous. Not only as a top shooter but also as a gunsmith. Are you done? - But... - You checked up on me? No, I'm a forensics detective for 6 years. Research is my forte, and a hobby. I looked up all the details. Because I admire you, Mr. Pang. I really want to learn, may I? Give me one reason why I should. For me! I never do anything for anyone. Got it. Coming, Fatso? He loves you, doesn't he? I shouldn't have brought you. Unload your gun. Your speed... We won't discuss that. You squinted and shook your head. Don't be afraid of the sparks and sound. You must control the recoil and trigger. Back up. Headset on. You must learn to communicate with your gun. Each has its own character. Communication will bring out its best. What do you mean? What I mean... Don't fall next time you do that. Yes... And do this 100 times, 1000 times. Until when you aim you point at the target. The only reason to shoot is to win. To show how good you are. How do I know my limit? When you meet a real expert. Why must you be a bookie? You're smart, you can do anything. I like it. You can't stop me forever. I can bet you. The drop on the left will hit the table first. All I need are 2 drops of water. So? Who won? Who cares? But for me. The left by about 0.025 seconds. Wait, from my angle... Don't argue with me. They drop from my hand, I can tell. Now you're blaming your hand. Of course. Good, thanks. That was a conversation on 1972, between an FBI agent and the head of the largest US syndicate. What can you tell from that? He despises me, leads me on. Using me to kill time. And won't admit defeat. He's showing him he's stronger. A criminal's state of mind. I enter their world, see things their way. Gambling is his personality. Arrests can't stop him. He gambles with anything. Even water. Upon release, he won't change. Be a hunter. Actions reflect personalities. Imagine you're a killer, act like him. Not easy to do. But to know his next step. You must feel his heart. Know an artist by studying his art. Know a criminal by visiting him in jail. Correct. And serial killers like to return to the scene. Why? There's no definite answer yet. Be extra careful with these criminals. They think it's fun to go against the police. - Good bye. - Bye. You didn't drive? No, my wife has the car. I'll drop you off. I'm fine, just don't be late tonight. We'll try it again. I think the drop on the right is faster. Because your middle finger is longer. So is everyone else's. Good news, it's time to buy Chu Wing. I don't like gambling. It's not gambling. Stocks require judgement and analysis. That's out forte. Mine is to take care of my wife. You're talking a lot recently. What's up? You've either won big, or lost everything. I can pull nothing over you. You're joking. Yes! I finally got you! See you later. You do great alteration work. No wonder you're so highly recommended. If a car engine isn't finely tuned. It's useless even if it looks great. But this gun feels like it's flying out of my hand. Is it the trigger too loose? It's your trigger freeze. It's a waste of the gun shooing at these. Bring me another target. Yes, Mr. Yeung. It feels different. Isn't it great with the flesh flying out? What? Bring me another. Just hold it in your hand. But sir! Higher, higher... Please be careful. Hold still, I might get you. What are you doing? No blood to my gun. I'll refund your money later. Why you like me? Don't know. All I know is, the world is perfect with you. Don't you think I'm an introvert? So am I. You're sick, go to see a doctor. Let's go together. Great. I've altered your gun. Gave you a 13-pound recoil spring. Lightened the slide for speed and accuracy. But change the slide every 5,000 shots. My alterations are not crazy like others. Who are you talking about? Rick did one for C. C. Yeung. It's fast and great, but dangerous. Every gun has its own personality. Rick's good for the right client. If you think so. Let him after your gun. No. You each have your speciality. No one's right or wrong. I think Rick is talented. He's so good in shooting. But too bad he stopped competing. I'd like to face off with him. Still too slow. I'm afraid the gun will... What? Backfire? You have an advantage? Your weight. And you still can't control the gun. You don't trust the gun. You don't trust me. Got it. Right. You've low standards. Of course it backfires if you do this. But it doesn't mean others can't control it. Your hybrid guns are fast. But when everyone shoots equally well. In competition it's accuracy and tactics. And if not in competition? Then it's only an "if". There's no answer to that. Will you be in this year's match? Definitely. Good! You are lucky. I'll be the surveyor. Otherwise... Goodbye. What's a surveyor? Surveyor is the police of shooting ranges. Whatever happens at the range. Only he can stop it with his gun. Do backfires count? Try it and see. - Morning! - Good morning! - Here for your gun? - Yes. Okay. IPSC Hong Kong Match in 1996. Are you ready? Standby! Time is 16.45 seconds. - 2 Alpha. - 2 Alpha. - Alpha Charlie. - Alpha Charlie. O.K. Shooter, are you ready? Standby! O.K. Shooters if you're finished, unload and show clear! Gun is clear. Hammer down holster! Range is clear the time is 10.35 seconds. - 2 Alpha. - 2 Alpha. Great. Thank you. You've got a high score. It's okay. Is he giving you pressure? Nuts! Of course not, why? - Feeling all right? - I'm fine. Shooter, are you ready? Standby! O.K. Shooter. If you're finished unload and show clear! Gun is clear. Hammer down holster! Range is clear the time is 10.23 seconds. Are you ready? Standby! - Alpha Charlie. - Alpha Charlie. Standby! Miu:14,937 Pang:14,902 The range is hot! Shooter, are you ready? Standby! I'll get you a drink! Now you know there's an expert behind you. Yes. He's nervous when you stand behind him. Officer Miu... You shot so well. I did okay. How many A's? Go out and see how it goes. - See you later. - Bye. I wanted a fair match. Same as people marks you in the football. So what? Aren't we friends? Let's go. The scores are almost tied. You'll catch up tomorrow. In a match, a point is a point. No need to fear them. They pressure you because they fear you. To me, you're always the champion. - Really? - Really. Bring me the plan. Time me. Okay. Are you ready? Start! How long? Can you come watch the match today? Why? You know I don't like to see you shoot. Just come. No matter what, you're my champ anyway. You'll win for sure. This is stage 4, field course These are all the targets. These must be shot hanging from this rope. Standby! Stop! Shooter, relax! Okay, give me your gun. Shooter, you're disqualified. You aimed past the safety zone, understand? Understand. Disqualified! It's fine. I've been DQ before. Standby! Yes! The scores are tied after this round. So we'll go an extra stage. You have 5 steel targets. Ioad and make ready, condition one, step in the box. Draw and shoot when you hear the signal. If you shoot outside the target area. You will forfeit the game. No more questions, test out the positions. The range is hot! Shooter, you may load and make ready! Chu Wing stock owner lost 300 millions today. Are you ready? Yes! Calm down! Relax! Shoot me! Shoot me! You see me with a gun. Shoot me! Shoot me! Shoot me! Why don't you shoot me? Yu, calm down! I'm done for. I'd hate to harm my family. As long as I die... They'll be rich, help me! Why won't you help me? Help me! Help me! Help me... Why won't you help me? I beg you, please help me... He's been here half an hour, said nothing. It's not good to keep everything inside. We don't know what you're thinking. Tell yourself what you're thinking. I should have shot. If I had shot... He may not have died. I could have saved his life. He might have died too, who knows. Let bygones be bygones. Don't think too much. Right. I may also have aimed for his head. Don't. I want to see the smiling Inspector Miu. If not, we won't come again. You feel guilty? Uncomfortable? I can't sleep. My chest and head ache often. I hallucinate. This is normal. Everyone reacts this way. After a month, even 6 months. You will still have these problems. And occasionally depressions. As long as you take this medication. You'll fully recover soon. I will? Yes! Just believe it's not your fault. Think, he was a psychotic, about to kill a group of innocent people. You shot him to save those people. I want to know what I'll be. The way you were before. Living the life you love. A normal person's life. Life goes on. Thank you. Doctor. There's something I never told the doctor. What? I know I killed someone. But I'm very happy. Really. We're at murder scene 2, Body D, shot dead. Body E pushed him away after he was shot. Bullet entered left shoulder at 45 degrees. Went through shoulder and mandible into the head. - Vincent. - This is bad. Be careful of your hair and dandruff. Vincent, there's trail of footprints. From Room 7172 to murder scene 1. Then to the bedroom at scene 2. It's been a short time after the crime. We hope to find his escape route. Only body D had enough time to react. The shot went through his hand to body E. He did his best security job, but it's all the same. No one had the chance to draw their guns. In both rooms, everyone was shot twice. Body E, the G4 protection target. Was by the bed, pushed away Body D. Was hit in the shoulder by the palm bullet. And wanted to run when hit in the forehead. Officer Wong... Is it true the witness is still alive? Pulse 20, blood pressure 32 Any clue of the killer? A professional? Sorry, no comment. Blood pressure down to 4! Give him 30 heart presses. I can't speak for any department. Tentative data is here. Yeung's criminal files are on your desk. Preliminary forensics report in 2 hours. Autopsy report tomorrow. Give me a briefing in 3 hours. let me know of any progress. The police haven't released any information. In this afternoon's shooting incident. The wounded victim's identity is unclear. He may be prosecution's witness, in the recent smuggling case, C. M. Cheng. The motive is very clear. Keeping someone silent. Team C may invite Yeung for questioning. As for the killer, Joe... We don't have any witnesses yet. But G4s report in every 30 minutes. So the murder was between 14:14 and 14:40. We think he acted alone. Vincent, please. The suspect's footprint is 27 cm long. His height is estimated at 178cm, Normal stride, weight about 160 Ibs., male. Weapon is a semiautomatic. With 0.4 bullets with large caps. So each carries more powder. Likely the killer's own creation. Team A, please find out for me. Which firearms dealers carry this powder. Killer left no fingerprints. Only the G4's fiber on Cheng's clothes. We believe the killer didn't touch him. Kim from G4 will work with us. Immigration has sent entry and exit data. The killer knows Cheng is being rescued. He won't leave with an incomplete mission. I need a questionnaire... from all Hotel staff and guests after the incident. If they've met especially interested persons. Remember! The killer is our only clue of Yeung's case. Is that clear? Yes, sir! There are the data from immigration of H.K. Macau, and Lo Wu about all the suspects. But no report from the airport. When did you work yesterday? Day shift. From when to when? Between 3 and 4 p.m. yesterday. Did anything happen nearby? No, I've just checked in about one hour. I can't help you. Thanks. You Hong Kong cops workhard. To kill 4 agents in such a short time. He's not an ordinary killer. He knows police operations well. But may not be a present of former officer. He can get that information from a policeman friend. He lives alone. Otherwise he can't practice shooting at home. He has a lot of guns in his house. Self-confident, even an egomaniac. Possibility of psychosis. But definitely not perverted. Because he treated them as humans. By shooting them in the head? Otherwise he would dehumanize them. By riddling the bodies with bullets. I believe he often goes to police hangouts, bars. Listen to talk about cases and technology. So he would risk it and stay at the hotel. To watch us work. Officer Miu, we got a call from the hospital. Good news and bad news. The good news is? C. M. Cheng will live. And the bad? He may never regain consciousness. And become a vegetable. Keep this under wraps. Why? The killer will go to kill him again. If I were he. I would not move yet. I would wait. Until I know I've failed. Money is not important. Killing makes me feel I'm alive. Why shoot at the head? It's risky. You say he knows police operations. He knows they wear bullet-proof vests. But there's the lower body, a larger target. He thinks it's a game, the harder the better. Only a few people in Hong Kong can do this in under 10 seconds. Mr. Yu, please come with us for questioning. Mr. Wong, you have a meeting at 2. Move it to 4; call the driver to come at 3:15. Mr. Wong, come with us for questioning. Good morning, Mr. Ho... Stop running! Freeze! Stop or we'll shoot! What lawyer? We're not charging you. Yes, officer? Sir, I have a few more meetings. He used a real gun, This is an air gun. Can't he shoot air guns after the real one? Your name? Yu Chi Wah. Why did you run when you saw us? I thought you were the loanshark. We heard you excel in practical shooting and say you've done many double taps. I was just bluffing. Of course I'm not the best. Let the lefty in Room 1 go. Do you know C. C. Yeung? Yes, he takes advantage of people. When did you last see him? When I left his company 3 months ago. Where were you on November 28th, 1999? Don't you have ashtrays? Do you know the man in the photo? No. They say they know you. And do you know Mr. K. S. Li? Yes. Same thing. I'm famous, people know me. The question is, does Li know you, right? All right. Let's start over. Your name? Please ask relevant questions. Almost there. Wei, Room 4. Name's Yeung. It's so common. Do you have a first name? Yeung Ching Cheung! What? What do you want? I'm not afraid! My lawyer is here! Can't the police dept. have power failures? Inspector Miu, the suspect is finally talking. He was with someone else's wife. Call his wife to bail him out. Any more suspects? They're here. Mr. Pang, are you still altering guns? No. Your present occupation? None. Do you know anyone in these photos? Am I close enough? Be serious! Shall I show you photos of the corpses? I knew you did it. you could have shot anywhere. But you got him in the head. Like the G4's in the hotel. Professionals go for the heart. Only you go for the head; you're insane! These are not recent photos. I don't know anyone here, can't help you. Only you can do How much longer can we hold him? About 20 hours. Apply for a search warrant now. Put Joe and Forensics on standby. Anything new? No. We found numerous weapons in your house. You live with him; you're an accomplice? Things don't look good for you. May I have some water? Power failures again. And you, Officer? I know him. Well, Rick? I haven't seen you on the range in 3 years. Why did they bring you here? What do they suspect you of? Murder? You're an expert in shooting, not killing. What is the police thinking? Bringing in everyone who shoots. That's hundreds of people. They don't look suspicious. Shall I get you a lawyer? Get some paper, writes this down. Got it? It's my number. I'll let you know my arrangements. You must have a new number by now. I don't have your number. Never mind. Look, don't be afraid. You alter guns, that's a legit business. You didn't kill, and they have no evidence. They would have gotten you if they did. And not beating around the bush. You think they're so great? See till they find your gun. He's the one. Great! Don't you have anything to say? Where did I go wrong? Go on. Joe, how's things there? Also 1.75. I've tested them all; they're fine. Likes to alter guns... bearings. Test the guns again with these bearing. You visit him every year. Yu. I see the flowers you put at his grave. You, too. I don't think anyone will forget it. I've wanted to know. Why didn't you shoot him? Because he's your friend? No. You were chicken. You are the champion. But only of paper target shooting. You don't have the courage. I tell you, shooting at paper and at flesh... They feel completely different. From that day I knew guns are made to kill people. Guns don't kill. People do. No more speeches about guns being good. People invented guns... To kill people. You killed C. M. Cheng. Yes, I killed people. And the 4 agents in the room. But that was a long time ago. I forget. You were there; you saw it happen. How does it feel to kill? You want to know that? I'll let you find out. But I'm afraid you'll be addicted. Did anyone tell you, you're changed in 3 years. And I have you to thank? You're giving yourself excuses. We found many altered guns in your home. You can't tell air guns from real ones? We won't miss any clues. We'll meet again. Sure. We must finish the final stage in our match. Hope we can. I'm going to say hello to Colleen. She said that all the guns we found are hers. We'd to ask her here, Formalities. You have to release me in 3 hours. But I want to wait for Colleen. Please get us some breakfast. Sure. Sit here. Your birthday is in a few days; take it easy. We found the guns in your home. But the owner doesn't have to be you. All the guns are mine. If an air gun has a burn radius of 2 or more. It's legally a real gun? Illegally concealing a weapon is a felony. Did someone lie to you? No, I knew it going in. Why are you doing this for a man? Have you ever loved someone? It is my regret to release you. You're praising me. Don't! Stop! Enough! Time's up, or I'd have demanded inspection. Release her, Miu. Let's go. I'm officially arresting you. Your air guns have greater than a 2 radius. Don't you dare frame her! Want to fight? I won't charge you for attacking an officer. No! Take her away! Miu, don't frame her. Let her go. I believe my co-worker. Colleen admitted the guns are hers. We work with evidence. If you've evidence, charge me now! We've evidence she's concealing firearms. Mr. Pang, we've released you; you may go. You will regret this! Peking calling Doghouse. Hunter got in taxi HV2371, Tat Chee Road. Return to Doghouse; Sisi, sniff his butt. Sisi is on. Chow Chow, await orders at Tai Hang bus stop. Copy. Doghouse, Hunter returned to Tai Chee Rd. Homeward bound; what now? Sisi, give up the chase, Chow Chow, get ready. Chow Chow is on Hunter, towards Cornwall Street. Master, do you read? Stay 2 car lengths behind him. Does his gun have a greater radius than 2? Did he kill someone? I only know he killed 4 G4 agents. You saw him staring at our guns. Tell me if I'm out of line. Chow Chow to Master, Hunter discovered us. Overtake him, Squirrel, stand by. He's headed to Kowloon Bay. Be careful, Squirrel. Wolf, stand by to take over. That way. Doghouse, he got out at an illegal place. We've been discovered. Keep following him. He runs away, what now? Don't let him go, even if we must release him later. Hunter's disappeared. Sorry, sir. You've got rid of them but not me. Running? Think you'll get away? My brother won't die in vain, I'll get you! I'll kill you! Doghouse, Hunter's back. Bite his tail! All of you! Something is wrong. Report on your positions. Hunter is going up a hill. Everyone goes to Channel 2. Repeat, everyone goes to Channel 2. Bad reception on the hill. Please repeat... Hunter's location... He headed to the Gun Club... Master calling... please repeat... Squirrel calling. He entered the Gun Club, over! Hunter in the Gun Club... Back off, all teams! Repeat, back off all teams! Master... do you read! We'll go in, you two wait here. Yes, sir. - All right? - Okay. Bo may never walk again. I operated on a patient today. Removed a kidney; he died in 10 minutes. So many die in surgery daily. I try my best, but not everyone can be saved. I pushed him too far. What's crucial is not why we let him go. But how to catch him again. You're a police officer, my husband. You may go anytime. Don't tell me to go! Do anything you want... I won't be a burden to you. Do you know how stupid you are? Don't think you can stop me. If you do, I'll kill you! Are you ready? Yes! Are you ready? Yes! Double Tap! Rick! I'll help you... Why are you here? I said I'd leave you the key. You don't trust me? I won't trust you too. The passport and money are inside. Leave as soon as you can. I thought you worked safely and cleanly. Never thought a woman would cause this. Let her take the blame. A year or 2 in jail, then happy as ever. Marry, have kids, whatever you want. Why did you shoot the cops? For fun? They didn't have evidence against you. Now everyone knows you're insane. Get Colleen out for me. Don't turn yourself in; that's a life sentence. Give me time to think, but go now! I don't have time. I won't turn myself in. But I have an idea. You must help me. If I can... Thanks. She refused food and drink, and collapsed. I think she's suicidal. Inspector Miu. All right. Starving yourself is harmful. You may have health problems later. A professional takes money, does his job. Removes the target and he's done. But he's different. He seems addicted to killing. You made him do it, he didn't want to. He can't control himself. If you want to help, tell us where he is. - He's killed 7 of my men... - Are you afraid? You're afraid the next one is you. You're using me as your shield. You're starting to be afraid. Inspector Miu... If I can get her to help... I just want to arrest him, get it? Thank you, Sir! Inspector, you may close your case. I got rid of C. C. Yeung for you. It's time to let Colleen go. You're the one I want the most. Your deadline is noon tomorrow. Keep her past that, I'll kill a cop a day. You afraid? I'm not. Are you ready? Pang killed Yeung, He's out of control. We have the support of the bosses. Because the Cheng case is no longer one of silencing someone. But is now a public menace. You are all officers with shooting training. You know what kind of man Pang is. His race gun can hold 22 bullets. A police service revolver and hold 6. While they reload. He'll have time to shoot them in the head. We have 14 hours till Pang's deadline. I believe he'll come for his girlfriend. I think it's today. Happy birthday. I hate spending birthday alone. Can I do anything for you? Tell him. I won't be a burden to him. Not now, not ever. Happy birthday. One more minute. Are you releasing her? The police don't give in to threats. You're insane! Calling all units. Murder suspect Pang carries powerful guns. He's a suspected psychotic. With no regard for public safety. He is armed and dangerous. All units be on guard for him. There is a report from Wan Chai, check it. Yes, sir! Any report from other station? Not yet. Where's Joe? Home for his medicine. What are you doing? Sorry, sir! How you feel there's an expert behind you. Press here; you can last 30 minutes. If you don't, I don't know. Make your choice. I'll drop you off. No need, I'm fine. Give me the keys. Don't do that! Relax... calm down! Breathe slowly... Breathe in, slowly... Miu, look at me! What's wrong? Joe's dead. He's dead... Everything is fine. - Open up. - Inspector Miu. Get up and come with me. Get up! Come with me! Let's go out, see if he'll shoot me. See if he'll rescue you! Inspector, don't... - Out of my way. - Okay... Inspector, calm down. None of your business. - Go away! - Miu... Out! Get out! Don't do that, he's not worth it. Is Joe's death worth it? And the death of our other men? You won't be blamed for this. I'll take all the blame! Enough! This is not eye for an eye. You're not a hero. I don't want you to shoot and kill people. If you so, how are you different from Rick? Miu, put down your gun. If you get shot one day, remember... Calm down, think of nothing. Then breathe slowly. You'll have a greater chance of survival. Silly girl. Where's Inspector Miu? Inside. Let me join you. Will you shoot if his back is to you? Leave if you won't. Only shooters can help. Are you ready? We are; where do we release her? I'll let you know. Got it. Remember, noon sharp. Didn't you hear? Get the cars ready. We'll go as soon as we know the location. I'll take Colleen. Chiu and Chik, come with me. Sue, notify the SWAT team to stand by. Whoever sees him. Shoot to kill, without harming the innocent. The mall is too crowded. We'll wait for your orders here. When he leaves the crowd we'll take over. We'll try to evacuate the mall. We have men at every exit. We'll take care of things inside. Suspect is here! Be careful! Not him. Don't move; you're covering me. Sorry, sir! Are you all in position? Ready! Target, come out now. Going on the escalator to 1/F. Chung, Sue, follow the Target. He stands. Target sees Hunter. Everyone in position, fire when you can. Careful, I don't have a bullet-proof vest. If you shoot me, you'll hit people behind me. Did you wear one? No. But I told them to shoot when they can. Like when you killed Joe. This makes it more fun. Are you all ready? Release her. Position A, I don't see him. Position B, too many people; I can't shoot. Position C sees Hunter. Once the stairs are clear, fire when you can. I don't think we'll meet again. Remember we still have a final stage. No! - Don't let them up. - Police on duty. Inspector, we're ready. Remember. I'm the champion. You might not win against me. Hunter is gone Take action! Be careful! They went into the cinema. Take action! Block the cinema! Go! Colleen is blocked my way. Shoot him! I order you to shoot him! Let go! Let go! Let go... Remember, we still have a final stage. Call an ambulance! Let no one in! Get down! Don't move! Are you ready? Calm down. Breathe slowly... Mrs. Miu, your husband is getting better now. Thank you!
