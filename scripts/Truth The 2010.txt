Wrong answer! No sleeping! What are you thinking? About my son. About his mother. Wrong answer! What are you thinking? -What do you want from me? -Wrong answer! l want answers, you hear me? l want answers! No sleeping! Did you hear me? Yes. What are you thinking? What should l be thinking? You're a guilty man. You entered a government facility illegally, in search of non-existent information. You failed in every respect! -Yes. -Say it! l'm a guilty man. l failed in every respect. l deserve the harshest punishment for my crime. -How long has he been here? -l've tried to get someone to say. -Who called you? -Kersh's office. Who called them? l don't know, l just know he's being held here indefinitely. -What for? -For the murder of a military man. Mulder? Dana. Oh, my God. You okay? Am l okay? Mulder, l haven't seen you in such a long time. l was so worried. No. lt's okay. l'm all right. They're treating me really well in here. What's happened to you? Nothing. l'm squared away. Hey, Walter. lt's good to see you, man. Have they told you the charges? What you're doing here? Yeah, we're clear on that. You're clear on what? My crimes. -Mulder-- -l murdered a man, Dana. l went looking for something that didn't exist, and l made a terrible mistake. l should be punished severely. Whatever you were doing, you have the right to a lawyer. To an inquiry and process of law. l don't think you've heard me. All right, time's up. We're going to get you out of here. How's that? l'm a guilty man. Time's up. Let's go. Excuse me. l don't understand. Why are you helping me? Because you can't do this alone. Let's go. You saw him? Mulder? They've accused him of murder? They have him believing that he did it. Of murdering who? Knowle Rohrer. Knowle Rohrer? lt can't be. l watched Knowle Rohrer die. He can't die. Knowle Rohrer's a super-soldier. Mulder sidestepped security at Mount Weather... ...where they say our so-called shadow government is installed. What about the murder charge? Thirty workers will testify they witnessed Mulder push a military officer to his death. Killing a man who can't be killed? Where are you going? To beg mercy with the man upstairs. Come in! Deputy Director Kersh. l've just been going over my notes for this whole business. Please, have a seat. Thank you. We've both got a problem with this man of yours, Agent Mulder. Mulder's been a running problem for the FBl. But nothing this serious. l would think-- l've been asked by a female agent, Mulder's closest associate... ...to beg mercy of the military court. To give Mulder every consideration based on his good character. You've reviewed the charges, yes? Yes. There's a charge of murder. This'd look bad for the Marines if it didn't look worse for the FBl. What does Mulder intend to plead? You wanted a chance to clear up this mess, Mr. Kersh. And l'm going to give it to you. Give it to the FBl. How? A fair hearing for your agent, by his own agency. Your prosecutor, your judges, held in my court. That can't be legal. Why do this? l want a verdict. A guilty verdict. This man, Mulder, has made a lot of enemies. He's a crusader. And a lot of people do not like the crusade. l can't do that. You'll do it, Deputy Director. You and l both know there are forces inside the government now... ...that a man would be foolish to disobey. Mulder? Mulder? l smelled you coming, Clarice. Damn it, Mulder. lt's not funny to see you putting on that act. No, that is funny. What's not funny is what they do to you in here if you don't put on that act. Come here, you big, bald, beautiful man. All you're gonna be kissing is your sweet ass goodbye. The trouble you're in. l kind of gathered that, right around the fiftieth brainwashing session. Why are they doing this to you? They think they're preparing me for my trial, for my testimony. Your testimony's not gonna matter. Not with the case they're building. Not building. Rigging. Yeah, l don't think you understand the seriousness of the charges. This isn't some routine wrist-slapping. You're on trial for your life. My trial's a foregone conclusion. They really want me to admit my guilt and help them out. What's really on trial here is the truth. Mulder, they're saying you killed a man. Have they produced the body? You can't produce a body, because you can't kill a man who won't die. Body or not, they've got 30 witnesses from that facility who'll testify against you. Mulder, we'll get you the best lawyer. To defend a man who believes in aliens, against the FBl and the military? lt's never gonna happen. Skinner can defend me. l can't represent you. You know the facts, the details, the whole government conspiracy. More than that, l trust you. Mulder-- They can't try me without exposing themselves. l know what l'm doing. Now it's a party. Agent Mulder. What's the matter? We've been working off what we have. But the military just got back to us. You ready for this? l know this is impossible... ...but they're saying they got Knowle Rohrer's body. Mulder, it's me. Time to go? No. That's why l'm here. Mulder, l need you to talk to me. Confide in me. Or we'll lose. We can't win, Scully. We can only hope to go down fighting. You're scaring me. l'm so scared that l've just got you back, and now l'm gonna lose you again. l know what l'm doing. Whatever you're doing... ...you have no idea how much has already been lost. What l've had to do. l do know. Skinner told me. Our son, Mulder. l gave him up. Our son. l was so afraid you could never forgive me. l know you had no choice. l just missed all of you so much. God, where have you been? Where have you been hiding? ln New Mexico. Doing what? Looking for the truth. You found something, didn't you? What did you find? l can't tell you. You found something in that facility. That's what you were doing, right? Mulder, what did you find out there? Look, Scully, l can't tell you. That doesn't make sense. You gotta trust me, Scully. l know things it's better you don't. Assistant Director Skinner. Special Agent Callenbruner. l'll be handling the prosecution. l'm out of the L.A. field office. How'd you get this assignment? l was a federal prosecutor in D.C. before joining the FBl. And you? That's a good question. Let's bring in the defendant. This proceeding is called to order. Mr. Callenbruner, you may proceed. l have no witnesses to call. l will submit to the court, however... ...the sworn testimony of 30 men and women who saw the crime. Assistant Director? l move for a dismissal on the grounds it violates the accused's right to a fair trial. l'm not a lawyer. You're not a judge. This is not a court of law. This is a military court of law. You may want to familiarize yourself with Title 10 of the U.S. Code. But l suggest you call the witness. Then l move to delay this trial. My central witness, Marita Covarrubias, works for the UN, and l can't locate her. l've received no help from the U.S. government locating her. l have to deny that request. Do you have another witness, Mr. Skinner? l'll call a witness, but l do so under protest. Both the panel's judgments and rulings are sovereign, Mr. Skinner. There is no record. Excuse me? This isn't a secret tribunal, as you so kindly inform me. lt's a court of law. Military court of law, Mr. Skinner. lt's okay. Try your case. Please state your name for the court. My name is Dana Katherine Scully. l was assigned nine years ago to the X-Files to spy on Agent Mulder... ...whose methods the FBl distrusted. Assigned not just as an agent, but as a medical doctor. A scientist. As a serious scientist, you came to believe in Agent Mulder's theories? l came to believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life. And in a conspiracy inside the government... ...to keep their existence a secret. The proof was overwhelming. lt was even scientifically undeniable. l believe, as do many respected scientists... ...that life came to earth millions of years ago... ...from a meteor, or a rock from Mars. So what you're saying is, life, human life... ...is extraterrestrial by definition? Objection. What does this have to do with Mulder murdering a man? lt will prove that a government conspiracy is hiding the existence of extraterrestrials. You are not here proving government conspiracies, Mr. Skinner. You're here to defend Fox Mulder. And l'm trying to do that. lt's your case, Mr. Skinner. So, a meteor crashed to Earth. But along with the biological building blocks on it, there was something else. An alien virus. l believe there was a virus which thrived here prehistorically. I beIieve that virus infected earIy man... ...and transformed his physioIogy. Changed him into something eIse? Into an aIien Iife-form himseIf. And what happened to these aliens? They died, in the last lce Age, And the virus? lt lay dormant, underground, until it surfaced, once again... ...during our current geologic period. And the government knows of this? The government learned of this virus in 1947... ...when a UFO crashed in RosweII, New Mexico. The UFO crash revealed the virus? The virus thrived underground in petroleum deposits. In bIack oiI. It has sentience. It can think. It has the abiIity to communicate. And it communicated with the UFOs. And the government knows this, too? ln Roswell... ...they captured aliens from the space craft wreckage. They saIvaged various aIien technoIogy from them, and from their databanks... ...they learned of the alien plan to re-colonize the Earth. ls this all leading anywhere? Yeah. The destruction of mankind. l'll warn you once, Agent Mulder. What did the government do with this information of an alien takeover? They kept it a dark secret. lf it had gotten out, there would have been wild panic. Mr. Skinner, are we finished? No, there's still Agent Scully's own abduction in 1994. Abduction by whom? By the military, working with the government conspirators... ...to deveIop a breed of human-aIien hybrids that the aIiens wouId use as a sIave race. Thank you, Agent Scully. Your witness, Mr. Callenbruner. All these E.T.'s running around.... Hard to keep these aliens straight without a scorecard. l, myself, have never seen an alien. Could we call one as a witness? You're being facetious. No. l'd just like to see some proof. There are the Mars rocks. No. l need something good. Something amazing. Really cool. l don't know what you mean. What l mean is, you have no proof to back up one word you just told us. lsn't it true that you and Mulder were lovers and you had his love child? Objection! Thank you. Next witness. Can you state your full name? Jeffrey Frank Spender. l know you didn't hear Mr. Callenbruner, but he'd like to mock the X-Files. You worked on the X-Files? Yes, until three years ago. When you were shot in the X-Files office. Shot by your own father? Please tell the court exactly who your father was. He led the government conspiracy to exploit the existence of aliens. Objection. l've seen no government conspiracy established here. l agree. l don't see where this is going. lf l prove this conspiracy, it will justify Mulder's actions... ...and you will have no choice but to acquit. l hope this isn't the entire basis of your defense, Mr. Skinner. You have a relationship to Agent Mulder, don't you, Mr. Spender? He's my half-brother. His mother had an affair with my father. But he never knew that. Not until he met you at the FBl. He didn't know both his father and mine were in the alien conspiracy. His father was a reIuctant member. When Agent MuIder began to know about this connection... ...my father had his father kiIIed by an assassin named AIex Krycek. He kiIIed him to siIence him? Mulder's father lived his life in shame. Not for the conspiracy, but for a terribIe decision he made. InvoIving Agent MuIder's sister? The aliens distrusted their human collaborators. Members of the conspiracy were made to give famiIy members as coIIateraI. So, Mulder's father gave up Mulder's sister? His own 8-year-old daughter? Mulder witnessed his sister being abducted by aliens. It haunted him to no end. It's why he pursued the X-FiIes. -What became of her? Samantha? -She was returned. She was sent to California, where we were raised together. She was taken many more times, and suffered horrible tests. Mulder spent years looking for her. Several times thinking that he'd found her. But he was tricked. Samantha was part of the cIoning experiment done by the conspiracy. She, herself, died in 1978. By your own father's hand, essentially. l went to work for the FBl. l didn't know of my father's crimes. When l stood up to him, he shot me. When l didn't die, he subjected me to the same horrible tests. Your witness. Mr. Spender, l'm sorry for your suffering. l'm sure none of us can really imagine what it's like. Your father must be brought to justice. l believe my father is dead. Mr. Spender, you're here to speak for the character of Agent Mulder. ln reports you filed while an FBl agent... ...l see you describe Mulder as ''arrogant,'' ''difficult''... ...''a control freak,'' ''widely disliked by his peers.'' l wrote that before l knew the truth. This report calls him ''unstable,'' ''prone to violent outbursts.'' l have the report right here if your memory needs refreshing. Thank you, Mr. Spender. You found out about Mulder? You found out he's in trouble. l'll get ready now. l know why you're here and what you want. l can't give it to you. Make them a deal, Mulder. Guilty on a lesser charge. Maybe they'll let you walk out of here. l'd rather die, Scully. How can you say that? How can you say that, Mulder, to me? Because this is greater than you or me. lt's what we've worked for for nine years... ...the truth that we both sacrificed so much to uncover and to expose. Then expose it, Mulder. Take the stand. Whatever it is that you're withholding, take the stand and hit them full force. l can't. -Why? -l just can't. You say this is greater than us. And maybe it is. But this is us fighting this fight, Mulder. Not you. lt's you and me. That's what l'm fighting for, Mulder. You and me. Get up. Who's that? Who's there? What are you doing here? That's what l'm here to ask you. l'm putting the truth on trial. What truth? Whose truth? You think these men will even hear it? They're afraid to hear it. They're not afraid. They have too much power to be afraid. You're going to learn that, just like l did. You'll die learning it. l'm not afraid of that. There's a truth even you're afraid to speak, because you know it's futile. No. Because l refuse to accept it. Then you're going to need help. How can you possibly help me? They said this is where l could find the body, at Fort Marlene. Right. The deceased's name is Knowle Rohrer, former Marine, last employed by the DOD. No, l don't want to call back. l want to talk to your superior-- The son of a bitch hung up on me. There's somebody in your yard. Where is he? He was at the back door. l got him. He's coming around. Stay where you are! Federal agent! Hands in the air! Who are you? What are you doing skulking around my house? l didn't want to be seen. l don't want to endanger him. Who are you talking about? Someone who wants to help Mulder. State your full name for the court. Marita Covarrubias. And your former government title? Special Representative to the Secretary General of the UN. The United Nations. A position giving you unrestricted access to countries and Ieaders around the worId. Isn't that right? Yes. How did you use this power? Basically, to further the interests... ...of a secretive group of men who called themselves the Syndicate. What were their interests? Developing an alien virus vaccine. Before the Russians developed one. And how'd they go about that? By testing innocent civilians all over the world. Test subjects were tracked... ...through DNA identifiers in their smallpox vaccination scars. Without the subject's knowledge? Mostly. Some deveIoped suspicions. I saw Russians who cut off their arms to prevent being tracked. As they did to an American man that you worked quite cIoseIy with. Yes. AIex Krycek. Did you believe in the Syndicate? And their international conspiracy? No. l was paid for my access. ln fact, you came to hate them. Yes. lt's why l helped Agent Mulder when he approached me. But you were found out, and the Syndicate punished you for this. They turned me into... ...a test subject. Testing what? They were pretending to work with the aliens... ...to infect the entire population with an alien virus. But the conspirators were trying to save themselves... ...by secretly and selfishly developing a vaccine. The conspirators believed all life in the universe was infected with the virus. IncIuding the shape-shifting bounty hunters who poIiced the conspiracy for the aIiens. But they were wrong. And it led to the destruction of the conspiracy. And who destroyed it? A group of renegade aliens, who'd avoided infection through self-disfigurement. And the conspirators themselves, what happened to them? They're all dead now. KiIIed by these same faceIess aIiens. What are you afraid of now? Why resist testifying here today? Because the conspiracy continues. Just in another form, by other men. Objection. Mr. Skinner can't ask questions and give the answers. Sustained. Fox Mulder's on trial, accused of killing one of these new conspirators. An alien replacement for a human being, called a super-soldier. You can prove this, can't you? You know who these men are, don't you? Ms. Covarrubias? They'll kill her. Ms. Covarrubias, l asked you a question. l need an answer. No. lt's okay. Let her go. What are you doing? She's the last best witness that we have. lt doesn't matter. Thank you, Ms. Covarrubias. l got nothing else. Assistant Director? l have an unscheduled witness that l'd like to call here today. -No, not him. -Mulder, sit down. l'm trying to protect that boy. Now he's here to protect you. Mr. Callenbruner, do you have any objections to this witness? Not like Mr. Mulder here does. Can you tell us your name? Gibson Andrew Praise. Do you know this man? Yes. He's my friend. l hid him in the desert for the last year. Mulder met you as a chess prodigy. Your Iife was endangered due to your unusuaI brain activity. Cut to the chase, Mr. Skinner. Gibson Praise can read people's minds. Mulder and Scully proved this, scientifically. There's a certain junk DNA... ...which all humans share, but has no apparent function. Gibson's junk DNA is functional, DNA which is believed to be alien. You're trying to tell us this boy can read minds? Yes. He's reading your mind right now. And the minds of the judges, too? Yes. Even his. And what makes him so special? He's not human. He's one of them. One of them! l want that man examined! -Mr. Skinner, control him! -Mulder! You're afraid of what l know! You're afraid of the truth! Where's Gibson? He's with Scully, in good hands. We spent the night talking to him. He knows you're concerned. We're protecting him. He shouldn't have done what he did, exposing himself like that. He was trying to protect you, and it may have worked. He says three judges are wavering. They're leaning in your favor. lt's gonna take a little more than that, the way things are going. We were never gonna win. Take the stand, Mulder. Testify. No. -Then we'll testify. Me and Monica. -No. Both of us have seen too much-- Listen to me. They'll destroy you. They'll put you out on the street. What's left for us on the X-Files? We came to this job to give it our best. lt's the way we're gonna leave. lt's not about how good you are. They control the game. They own it. Then let's shove it up their ass. Mr. Skinner? l'd like to call John Doggett. Agent Doggett, you've been on the X-Files for two years. With all that you've seen, how do you feel about this term, ''paranormal''? The way l look at it... ...calling something paranormal's just a way of avoiding a real explanation. You're a skeptic. But l see here in your reports... ...some very detailed descriptions of things that a skeptic would never believe in. These so-called super-soldiers. That's a whole different deal. ln what way? 'Cause l've seen them with my own eyes. Shot, drowned, even ground up in a garbage truck. And they just come right back to life. What are they? The best l can figure, they're some kind of secret military project. -Ordinary men made invincible. -Objection. What does this science-fiction have to do with anything? Agent Doggett will tell you that the man Mulder supposedly killed is a super-soldier. A man that Agent Doggett served with in the Marines. Name of Knowle Rohrer. Objection. Agent Doggett was not present at the murder. Nor has he seen or examined the victim. Because the government's given me the bum's rush. Objection sustained. Then let me ask you, Agent Doggett: lf a super-soldier is invincible... ...how could Mulder possibly have killed this man? He couldn't. The way l understand it, the only way to kill a super-soldier is with some rare metal. Agent Scully says it's a form of magnetite from some meteor that fell to Earth. Mulder's not accused of doing that, is he? No, sir. Your witness. Agent Doggett... ...in going over your files, l must say... ...it's an honor to speak to a man whose record shows such duty to his country. l won't doubt a man of your integrity, Agent Doggett. Even if he tells me a story l find too incredible to believe. Thank you. Just as you must not doubt the integrity of Fox Mulder, for whom you're testifying. Correct. Even if Mulder believes these so-called super-soldiers are aliens? He believes they're aliens, you know. -You said you were a skeptic. -That's right. So, an alien conspiracy, which Mulder has built his defense on... ...must be entirely unbelievable to you, too? My name is Monica Reyes. l've been with the FBl since 1990. Before coming on to the X-Files, you worked in the New Orleans field office... ...investigating cases of satanic ritual abuse. l did. -Were any of these cases prosecuted? -No. For God's sake, Mr. Skinner. We're trying a man for murder. Not taking a trip down memory lane. l'm showing the court that Agent Reyes is level-headed and objective... ...on strange and extraordinary cases... ...that her belief in aliens comes from first-hand experience. She can offer you hard proof that there is an alien conspiracy. l was called on last year to protect Agent Scully... ...whose life was in danger because of her pregnancy. What does this have to do with aliens? l drove Agent Scully to a secluded location where we thought she could deliver safely. But we soon discovered we weren't alone. I was attacked, and had to defend myseIf against an assaiIant... ...who was shot at point-blank range, who should have died, but didn't. This assaiIant was then joined by others Iike him... ...who surrounded Agent Scully and me and witnessed her as she gave birth to her son. Witnessed her? What do you mean? We were confused, as well. But we came to understand that her son was a kind of miracle child. lts birth was all-important to these people, these so-called super-soldiers... ...who l believe are humans replaced by aliens. Why would Scully's child be important to aliens, Agent Reyes? We Iearned that ScuIIy was one of a number of random women... ...who had miracuIous chiIdbirths. These women all had been abducted... ...as part of a government program to manipulate their biology... ...operating off-shore on a Navy ship... ...using these women as surrogates. Surrogates? For alien babies. To create a slave race? Yes. A program, conducted by the Navy, on a ship, which is where? The ship housing this program was expIoded on a BaItimore dock. ln other words, we have no true evidence past your good word? You claim Scully gave birth to one of these alien babies. How can you be sure of this? l saw her child do things that could be explained no other way. I saw him dispIay amazing powers. He'd move objects with his mind. Could we arrange a demonstration that we could see ourselves? No. The child was given up for adoption to an anonymous family. She gave up the miracle child... ...the proof of everything that she and Mulder claim... ...they've risked their lives for over the last nine years? -She just sent it off to some strangers? -Yes. To protect him! Thank you, Agent Reyes. That's all. You don't care about that child. Or what Scully had to sacrifice. You're only too happy that there's no proof. Agent Reyes. You don't care what they've sacrificed, what's been lost to their cause. You make a mockery of it, gladdened it proves your point. That's enough! What is the point of all of this? To destroy a man who seeks the truth? Or to destroy the truth, so no man can seek it? Either way, you lose. Are you ready for this? We may have found Knowle Rohrer. You found him? His body. What are you talking about? He can't die. Knowle Rohrer's a super-soldier. Exactly. But they're saying it's him. The man Mulder killed. Who's saying it's him? l talked to a guy at Fort Marlene who didn't know he had to give me the runaround. l got him to send the victim's corpse to Quantico. lt's there now? We got a car out front. Agent Scully? Agent Doggett can stay with him. Oh, my God. This is Knowle Rohrer? That's what it says here. How could anyone tell if it wasn't? l need you to get me Knowle Rohrer's medical records. They'd have to come from the military. l don't know if l can. You've got to, Monica. Whatever it takes. l need those records for Skinner. l need them for Mulder. Mr. Skinner, please call your next witness. Assistant Director. l found it. What? What's gonna get you off. l move to dismiss again based on evidence l've just received that there is no victim. The body is not Knowle Rohrer. This man's neck was broken and his body was burned postmortem. -Motion denied. -You can't deny it. You're out of order and in contempt. You're in contempt! Of evidence proving that Agent Mulder is innocent! You had no authorization to examine the body. Remove her from the courtroom! -She's got evidence. You gotta listen. -Order! Remove the defendant from the courtroom! This trial is adjourned! Gentlemen. We have a verdict. lf you'd rise? Acting fairly, and impartially, this panel finds the defendant... ...guilty of first degree murder under aggravated circumstances. ls there anything you'd like to say on your behalf, Mr. Mulder... ...before we decide your sentence? Yes. l'd like to congratulate you. On succeeding where so many before you have failed. A bullet between the eyes would have been preferable to this charade. But l've learned to pretend over the past nine years. To pretend that my victories mattered, only to realize no one was keeping score. To realize that liars do not fear the truth if there are enough liars. That the devil is just one man with a plan. But evil... ...true evil is a collaboration of men... ...which is what we have here today. lf l am a guilty man, my crime is in daring to believe... ...that the truth will out, and that no one lie can live forever. l believe it still. Much as you try to bury it, the truth is out there. Greater than your lies, the truth wants to be known. You will know it. lt'll come to you, as it's come to me: Faster than the speed of light. You may believe yourselves rid of your headache now. And maybe you are. But you've only done it by cutting off your own heads. Yeah. l'll tell her. Who was it? Skinner. Agent Doggett? Death by lethal injection. 'Evening. l.D., please? Master Sergeant Rohrer. Go on ahead. Get up! Who's there? l'm here with Skinner. Get up. Move it, Mulder. What are you doing? We're getting you out of here. Come on. Guard! Where is he? Seal the building. Seal the base. We have an escaped prisoner! You're never gonna make it this way. Come on. Mulder? You've got to move out. What's he doing? What l should've done from the start. You want to go north to Canada. Get to an airport. lf you're not gone in 24 hours, you may never get out. Do you understand? None of you will be safe now. You let us worry about that. Good luck. Kersh told us to head north. You just got on a road going south. That's right. Where are you going? To see a man about the truth. You can't hide me forever. We can destroy your files, make it next to impossible to find you. You don't know these people. l'm gonna protect you, Gibson. John? What the hell is this? What the hell's going on? They can't do this. Who authorized this? l'm gonna find out. Skinner. They've packed up the X-Files. I know. lt's out of control. l'm trying to get to the bottom of it. l'm trying to get to Kersh. All l can think is it's punishment for taking Mulder's side. Unless they found out that we helped him escape. Then they know about the Deputy Director's involvement, too. l need to see the Deputy Director. And he needs to see you. He knows. Then we're all in danger here. No. He knows about Mulder and Scully, where they're going. You mean the border? No, that's not where they went. And they know that. They're gonna find them and kill them. Where are they, Gibson? Mulder and Scully, where'd they go? Hey, hotshot. You might have the common courtesy of doing your business there, downwind. Oh, boy. Why don't you just finish draining the little lizard, and then we'll talk. We're very worried about you. lt's craziness, man. Turn around. Just hang a big U-ie and never look back. l can't. Why risk perfect happiness, Mulder? Why risk your life? Because l need to know the truth. You already know the truth. l need to know if l can change it. Change it? For crying out loud, you'll only get yourself killed. Mulder? What are you doing? l'll be right with you, Scully. What are they? Pueblos. Anasazi lndians. Abandoned 2,000 years ago. Nobody knows why. Yeah, Mulder, but what are we doing here? Hello. My name is Fox Mulder. Do you understand me? Mulder, what is this? l was sent a message and a key to the government facility at Mount Weather. The lndian said it was from a wise man who lived in the ruins. The Keeper of the Truth. Do you see anything at aII? What's the matter, Agent Mulder? You come to see the wise man, but you look as if you've seen a ghost. You're not a wise man. You're a dead man. Just like Krycek and X. Do you see a dead man, Agent Scully? l hoped and prayed you were dead, you chain-smoking son of a bitch. You waste your time. Ask Mulder. He knows the futility of hopes and prayers. He knows the truth now. You have told her the truth, haven't you, Fox? l helped you find it. You didn't help me. You sent me to that government facility knowing exactly what l'd find. And now you refuse to speak it. Not to Scully, not to anyone. You even refused to testify what you learned. Even though it would have saved your life. You damn me for my secrets but you're afraid to speak the truth. You call me afraid? Look at you, sitting here alone in the dark like a fossil. lt's the final refuge. The last place to hide from those who are insidiously taking power now. Who? The aliens. They fear this place, its geology. Magnetite. Like that which brought down the original UFO in Roswell. lndian wise men realized this over 2,000 years ago. They hid here. And watched their own culture die. The original shadow government. Agent Doggett! Who the hell is that? Which leaves me to tell you what Mulder's afraid to, Agent Scully. Come on, let's go. lt's a scary story. You want to come sit on my lap? You don't scare me. My story's scared every President since Truman in '47. -You don't have to hear this. -No, l want to hear it, Mulder. Ten centuries ago, the Mayans were so afraid... ...that their calendars stopped on the exact date that my story begins. December 22, the year 2012. The date of the final alien invasion. Mulder can confirm the date. He saw it at Mount Weather. Where our own secret government will be hiding when it all comes down. Yeah, you smile. Feeling drunk with power. Power to do nothing. My power comes from telling you. Seeing your powerlessness hearing it. They wanted to kill you, Fox. l protected you all these years, waiting for this moment... ...to see you broken. Afraid. Now you can die. Run, Monica. Get out of here. No. Knowle Rohrer, that's far enough. Shoot me, Agent Doggett, if you think it'll make a difference this time. Agent Doggett! Mulder, get out of there! They know where you are! Get out of here! -Get in the car! -No! Go! Go! What are you thinking? Mulder? l'm thinking.... l'm a guilty man. l failed in every respect. l deserve the harshest punishment for my crimes. You don't believe that. l believe... ...that l sat in a motel room like this with you when we first met. And l tried to convince you of the truth. And in that respect, l succeeded, but... ...in every other way, l've failed. You don't believe that, either. l've been chasing after monsters with a butterfly net. You heard the man, the date's set. l can't change that. You wouldn't tell me... ...not because you were afraid, or broken... ...but because you didn't want to accept defeat. l was afraid of what knowing would do to you. l was afraid that it would crush your spirit. Why would l accept defeat? Why would l accept it if you won't? Mulder, you say that you've failed. But you only fail if you give up, and l know you. You can't give up. lt's what l saw in you when we first met. lt's what made me follow you. Why l'd do it all over again. And look what it's gotten you. And what has it gotten you? Not your sister. Nothing that you've set out for. But you won't give up, even now. You've always said that you want to believe. But believe in what, Mulder? lf this is the truth that you've been looking for, what is left to believe in? l want to believe that... ...the dead are not lost to us... ...that they speak to us as part of something greater than us... ...greater than any alien force. And if you and l are powerless now... ...l want to believe that if we listen to what's speaking... ...it can give us the power to save ourselves. Then we believe the same thing. Maybe there's hope.
