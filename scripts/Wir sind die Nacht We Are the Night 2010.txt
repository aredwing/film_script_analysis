How many centuries would you search for him? And if you were to ever find him, would you let him go? Wouldn't you hold him as tight as possible with both arms and never, ever let him go? What did we jet to Paris for anyway? You shouldn't have killed the pilot. Charlotte?. Two more pages. I want to know how it ends. Now. - What a shame. - What?. It isn't your fault. Let me guess. Her eyes were too pretty to be true. Don't listen to her, Louise. You'll be lucky sometime. Sometime. Watch out! Freeze! Get down on the ground! Get down, I said! Hands behind your head! Spread your legs! Stay down! Freeze! Out of the way! Let go! Police! Ow! Excuse me! Hi. Did you see a guy run past?. This tall?. Hooded sweatshirt, dark pants. Sorry. What have you got?. Not a trace. I can't believe it! May I sit down next to you?. I have to rest a bit. That rat was too fast for me. What'd he do?. Who?. The rat who was too Fast for you. He ripped off a Russian pimp we were about to arrest. Oh. I bet he doesn't know who he ripped off, but he nearly screwed up our operation. Tom. Hi. Doesn't that hurt?. It's okay. There's broken glass everywhere. Thanks for the warning. It's too late. What now?. I have to arrest you. - If you catch me. - If I catch you?. I got away once. I didn't know who I was chasing. But now I know who I'm running from. Does it make you faster?. What kind of cop are you?. We could... Stay here. Stop it. I don't want to hurt you. Sorry, Tom. "Insufficient funds. Contact your bank." Hey, sweetheart. You didn't tell me your probation officer is so nice. Could I have a glass of water?. Yes, of course. - Are you crazy?. - Fuck off, man! Let her in. [translated] Cold nights Let your eyes shine Hollow dreams And my soul makes its demands Fast breathing Our bodies quiver Gently trembling... And my soul is burning I'm dying of thirst. Buy me a drink if I pay?. No, don't! Don't. Keep it. As a down payment for gazing into your beautiful eyes. Where are your friends?. What friends?. Nobody your age goes out without their clique. I fly solo. If you want to be different you have two choices. You are destroyed by their world, or you create your own world. You need money for that. All you need is courage. And you have both. Enough for two. I'd rather do my own thing. Good luck. You don't see it yourself. Your eyes are blind, although they betray you with every glance. What are you talking about?. About what's inside you. And what is it?. Something special. Rare. Breathtaking. You'd be the first human being to notice it. I'm no human being. Berlin. There was a tragic plane crash last night. A plane coming from Paris crashed within city limits... The lions first dig into the fallen prey, always a bloody but fascinating spectacle. I was so excited about you coming that I couldn't sleep. Nora. Come on! Good evening. What did you do to me?. Sit down. What did you do to me?. Don't. I know what you need. What's in there?. Your new life. To immortality. That's all bullshit! You're all crazy! Oh. Your new trophy doesn't seem to get the picture. You'll have to show her the proof. If you want her to swim, throw her in the water. - You have a girl for me?. - Yes. - Does she have any experience?. - Not yet. What are you doing to me?. I'll teach you something you don't want to learn. Don't show any sympathy. The more evil the man, the sweeter the blood. She said you're a shy girl. We'll take care of that. I paid for you! She learns fast. We rarely treat ourselves to pimps. Just wait. Oh, Louise. Pretty please. You have two red ones that you never drive. Let go. Let go. - Morning. - Morning. Morning. Morning. What's all this shit?. Ohlsen, where are the stiffs?. Downstairs. - Morning. - Hi. Did you tell anybody?. Where'd you get that idea?. Okay. How many stiffs are there?. Two. A burned body here. The second one's in the back. They died about eight hours ago. Is the one in the back burned too?. - Yeah. - Who found them?. - Two young kids. - Did you question them?. Well, I'll be damned. Am I dead?. You won't quench your thirst with abstinence. Well?. How does it feel?. Yes. I know. You have no idea what wonders await you here. I know how you feel, Lena. I remember my own transformation. It was a masked ball at court. It all happened so fast. I hated her at first. How could she do it to me?. But then we travelled all over Europe together. She showed me the world and opened my eyes. When she burned to death in Nice a century later, I wanted to join her. I was so desperate, so lost. But something held me back, a longing, a hope, and I began to search again. And now... I've found you at last. There's no way they could have manipulated the tapes. Hmm. There. Huh?. We have a witness. I don't get it. Zoom in. What's that on his ear?. Cool! You should have given her a wedding dress. Welcome to the family. You look fantastic. - Shall we?. - I don't have any shoes. Oh, my poor little Cinderella. Take yours. Press. The one with the fewest bags has to pay. Got a favourite restaurant, Lena?. Do we eat?. Just for fun. We eat, drink, sniff coke, and fuck as much as we like. But we never get fat, pregnant or hooked. Enjoy it. Billions of babes would kill to be in our place. Did you see that?. It can smile. The waiter isn't on the menu. That was my dessert. Enjoy it. Doesn't satisfy my hunger, but it still tastes awesome. Mmm! Mm! How old are you anyway?. - Tut, tut! - Never ask a lady's age. If Louise hadn't found me at the Love Parade, I'd be 37. Hey, sweetheart. Smoking isn't permitted here. Was that all you wanted to know?. How many of you are there?. - And the men?. - Extinct. They were too loud, too greedy, and too stupid. Some were killed by humans. We took care of the rest. And we swore never to bite a man who had the gift. Long live emancipation. Yes, for over 200 years, no man, neither mortal nor immortal, has told me what to do. No king, no boss, no husband. What woman can make that claim?. Excuse me. If you ever hit on me again, I'll have you fired! I know. It was a bit mean. But he's cute, isn't he?. Why do you treat him so cruelly?. I don't want to hurt him. You just did. I mean, really hurt him. People fall apart so easily. Come on! Charlotte. Charlotte! You're so beautiful. You're so beautiful. I didn't mean to rush into it. I'm sorry. Stupid Louise. Stupid, stupid, stupid Louise. "Print job in a print queue." Good morning. - You're early. - Yeah. Did you even go home?. I couldn't sleep. - Why not?. - No idea. Afraid of missing something. I'll give you some advice. Find something to offset your job. - Like a hobby?. - No, a private life. Cuddling and smooching. I'm working on it. Are you going out?. I wasn't home the last two nights. Didn't you notice?. You're old enough. Lena?. How did you find me?. Hi. I almost didn't recognize you. You have a police record. And you want to try to arrest me again?. No, I'm afraid of you. Wait a sec. You ripped off an asshole who pimps out little girls. If I arrest you, you'll get 18 months probation for car theft. And that isn't fair. Here. What is it?. unwrap it. I wanted to wash it, but my washing machine is broken. I found it behind the pillar after you'd left and I could get up again. Thanks. You bet. Changed your style. - I like it. - It's just a dress. No, you're up to something. You just saw me once before. You get a feeling for it in my job. Your hair is different. It's no longer dyed. You never used to wear shoes like that. I can tell by the way you wobble. Anything else?. Yeah. You wouldn't have had coffee with me at our first encounter. Will you leave me alone then?. We just got started. For good. I promise. Come on. Give it to me. Here. How's your hand doing?. It's healed. - Not bad. - I have good genes. Why would someone like you want to be a policeman?. Someone like me?. Someone who seems to be okay. Thank you. It's one of the few jobs that pays for an adrenaline kick. Racing through streets, kicking in doors and chasing crooks. I love it. Did you say that when you applied?. Sure. And you?. You always wanted to be a pickpocket?. Not anymore. That's good. Did I say something wrong?. - I have to go. - Really?. - Yes. - What a shame. Can I walk with you?. Sure. - Everything okay?. - Yes. You promised. Tear it up when I'm out of sight. Hey, Lena, why shouldn't we see each other again?. My boyfriend would make trouble. You think I can afford clothes like these?. It's my way of getting out of this place. You're the lousiest liar. "There's a strange element among us." Had enough nightlife?. Louise would say, you'll get used to it. She wants you to be happy here. I became too depressed for her taste. And now she thinks you're the one she's spent centuries looking for. You'd better not disappoint her. I was a very untalented actress. I wouldn't have survived in sound films. Louise and I met opening night. My husband and my little daughter had already gone home. You were beautiful. Would you have bitten me otherwise?. Or Nora or Lena?. Oh, Charlotte, don't ruin the evening for us. Because we're all in such a good mood. The ladies are quite moody today. You spoil us. So you aren't tortured by unfulfilled wishes. I miss the sun. I was afraid you'd miss something that I can't give you. - Where is he?. - In there. - Who are you?. - Drop it! Are you a policeman?. Drop your gun first. Slowly. Show me. Put me in the most secure cell in the best prison. Please. Hi, boys! Mwah! Get out of there! We'll press charges! Please, don't. Have mercy. I won't say it again! Get out! Why not take off your silly uniforms and jump in with us?. - What did she say?. - We should get in the water. We have so much room. What do they pay you, to miss out on all this fun?. Look. She's topless. It's our big chance. It won't come again. You won't harm them, will you?. I promise. Ladies. - Hello, Mr. Security. - Hello. - What's your name?. - I'm Bernd. Bernd. - What do you do up there?. - I keep watch. - It's completely normal. - Really?. Yes, by all means. Absolutely normal. Will you tell me your name?. Guess. Chantal. Mm-mm. Mandy?. Babette, Nicole, Steffi, Isabel. Where's my partner?. Did he leave already?. Do you know where my partner went?. Nora! "For Whom The Bell Tolls" Charlotte! No, Charlotte! Charlotte! Stop overreacting, and accept who you are. Nora! - Why did you do that?. - Why not?. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Oh, please! We need an ambulance! Mm-hmm. - Yes?. - Yes. No, no, no! Shh, shh, shh, shh. Tom Serner here. Leave a message after the beep. Hello, Tom. It's me, Lena. I... I didn't know who to call. I... They're dangerous... What illegal substances do you consume?. - Who?. Me?. - Yes. Drugs! Drugs?. No! Why did you burn your partners?. In German, please. I told you everything. I didn't kill anyone. It was the women with devil's eyes, and they run on the ceiling. Ah, they have wings, huh?. You mean they can fly?. Why did they steal my Lamborghini?. What?. My Lamborghini! Very expensive! - What colour?. - Silver. Silver like cross. Where did you find the Lamborghini?. At the Grand Hotel?. - No, let the SWAT team wait! - SWAT?. Not my decision. Hello, Tom. It's me, Lena. I didn't know who to call. What's up?. Got a girlfriend?. Wake up, my Romeo. No. No! What did you do?. Shh. The police are storming the hotel! I'll stop them. Position your people at all exits. Yes, immediately! - Which floor?. - The fourth. How did they find us?. We'll take the safe cars. Don't move! Charlotte! Get in, Charlotte! - Where is Nora?. - Behind me. Shit! - Stop! - What for?. Stop! We have to help her! Fire! She won't make it! Go! - Charlotte! - No! Be reasonable! Don't leave me alone! Nora! Come on! Gone. Come on. Hurry. Freeze! It's all over! Please, Lena. Don't hurt him! We're heading toward the light. Get out! What a crazy day. Who was that policeman?. I saw you together once. I have no idea what you mean. How does he know you?. He wanted to arrest me for a trifle. For a trifle?. Nora burned to death for a trifle. We're on the run for a trifle! And you led them to us! That's wrong! I didn't tell him. How did he find us?. You kill people every night! Do you think nobody notices?. She's right, Louise. We were never good at cleaning up. - Are you on her side?. - I'm on nobody's side. Just calm down. Of course. Of course. We need money and new passports. I want to say good-bye before we leave town. It smells like death here. When was the last time that Charlotte saw her?. She's asleep. Maybe it's better this way. Mommy. Come on. Come on. It's time. The next sunrise we'll see is in Moscow. Charlotte. No! Charlotte! No! I'm sorry. Open the door! Don't do this! Open the door! Charlotte! No! Open the door! Charlotte! Charlotte I wanted to see you before I go. Who are you?. I can't explain it in words. Stay there! Let go. - Stop it. - Look right at me. Let go! No, damn it! Lena! Look right at it. - An ambulance. - No, look at it. Just shut up. No! Lena, no! Come on! Sorry, I had to do it. I'm sorry too. Fucker! Good evening. How do you picture your future, Lena?. Even if he stayed with you, which I doubt, he'd only have 60 years at most. And then... Then you'd be alone. And then your loneliness will devour you bit by bit. Believe me. I know what I'm talking about. Be quiet. No. Lena, run away! Louise, don't hurt him! Please! I'll give him his life, under one condition. Tell me you love me. So that I believe you. I love you. I love you. I love you, Louise. I love you. The loveliest lie I've ever heard. No! No! Now we're the only ones left. Headquarters?. I'll call for a manhunt. I'll do it. Headquarters. Come in, please. Okay, call in forensics. Headquarters. Come in. Good luck.
