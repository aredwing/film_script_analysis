Definitely money first. I was conceived in Las Vegas, Nevada. In less than two hours my birth parents met, Consummated, and ended their relationship. And nine months later on the mainstage of the pussycat club, Mom's water broke, And with awhoosh, I was born. That's me, George Calvin Menhoffer. Cal for short. My best friend's parents met at this drive-in theater. It's nowa Starbucks. We think it was in this public bathroom Inside this filthy stall, Where sperm met egg And little Leonard Smallwood came to be. He's so cute you just want to shmoosh him. Here's the orphanage where Lenny and I grewup together. It's nowa Starbucks. That's me and Len around age six, And that's old sister Mary. Ugh...what aface. At 16 we hit the road in search of the American dream. Big bucks, cool parties, fast oars, and women. More specifically, that woman. Oh, you won't believe the things I'll do To spend a night with her. We quickly realized life can be cruel to a couple of orphans-- Road kill crew, Norman, Oklahoma. Sanitation engineers, Kansas City, Kansas. Minimum wage and all-you-can-eat salad bar. Human shark bait, P.T. Cartwrighfs freak showand circus. Wabash, Indiana. Those freaks, uh, good people. After seven years, the American dream Was nowhere in sight. But things were about to change. Destiny led us west to the dream capital of the world-- South central Los Angeles. Broke, desperate, and starving, I came up with an ingenious, flawless Brilliant plan that would ultimately change our lives forever. I don't knowabout this, Cal. If you wanna buy food, Len, you gotta have money. Ifsjust the way society works today. But we've never done anything like this before. I'm sick of working for minimum wage, man. We're bustin'our asses and gettin'nowhere. Riding public transportation with a bunch of pathetic losers. No offense. I like your hat. We deserve betteryou and me. Don't worry, buddy. I got big plans for us. You gottatrust me, okay? I'm with ya all the way, Cal. I'm tellin'ya, man. Our luck is about to change. We are this close to having our share of the American dream And all the goodies that go along with it. Does that include fries? Damn straight, buddy. Think of today, this very moment ls our-first step straight to the top. And let's never-forget what sister Mary used to tell us-- Take this, you little piece of shit? Such an unhappy woman. You know what, though? We're gonna showher. Success is the best revenge. You're a genius, Cal. I know, buddy. I know. Hello. Here we go. She looks nice, I guess. Come on. Once you get through this first one, the next one's gonna be easy, all right? It's gonna be like taking candy from a baby, Len. Let's do this on three, okay? All right. One. Go. Just go. (slowmotion) what the...? ' Got it! ' Got it! Oh... Oh, my god! Woman: that man took my arm! Somebody stop him! Somebody help! He got my arm! Is anybody gonna help?! (stuttering) I'm sorry. L--I'm sorry. [ail I can't believe you stole my arm! And you're gonna... I gave it back! I can't believe you! Hang in there, Len. I'm 0omin'! Don't hurt him! He'sjust a boy! Aah! Hey, Steve. Open gate one. See ya, Marty. Oh... An amputee! W-what are the odds? Every day with the amputee. I keep telling you it's a million to one. Come on, we gotta get our act together, man. No more screw-ups. We're bright guys, you and me. Back at the orphanage, Sister Mary always said to turn to the lord, And he'd have all the answers. Yes... What would god tell a couple of entrepreneurs like you and me to do? That's far enough, ladies! Aah! Hey! Hey! The bags, mama! Hand over the bags, or we'll blow your heads off! The bags! You ol'bags! I think they might be deaf, Mordecai. Wait a minute. You're not Jewish. Don't make me pop a cap in your ass. 'Cause I vill. I'll pop za cap Right up in the ass! Now, hand over that bag, you ol'bag! Oh, god! I'm blind! I'm a loser. Yes, sir, afool. that's what I am, Lenny. A pathetic fool. So two old ladies got the better ofus. Life can't get anymore humiliating than that. Yeah, well. You got a point there. Hey. ..buddy... Why don't you take a picture. It'll last longer. We were robbed, uncle Walt. Yesterday. After leaving the bank, begging for money. We could've been killed! I sawmy life flash before me. Can you begin to imagine Howdepressing that is? We're gonna lose our home, you nut! You know what I love? The smell of Nazi fear. That magnificent aroma-- like daisies. Only putrid. Where's our money, uncle Walt? June 6, 1944, d day. Bombs exploding all around! Nazis dropping like flies. God, I wish I was there! It's syphilis, I'm telling you. It's advanced syphilis. What's the stupid meeting about? I'm a busy man, dammit! Our money, our inheritance. We have nothing left, uncle Walt! Forget about it already. It's gone. Long gone. All of it. I wanna see what's in that safe of yours! Jesus, I love the word shrapnel. Howcould daddy put this deranged lunatic In control ofourtrust? You're destroying us, uncle Walt! The battle of the bulge, Doris. Ever hear of it? I missed it by this much. Patten, that son of a bitch, kept me in Newark Distributing how to avoid V.D. Pamphlets. You're a sick, twisted freak! A liar, and athief! And you're mean. Howdare you insult aworld war ii veteran? Who almost died for his country ifhe would've fought. Howmany times is someone Gonna point a gun at me this week? You'll pay forthis, you son of a bitch! Yeah. that's what Hitler said. Look where he is now-- Burnt up to his ass! He needs so much therapy. We're gonnawind up in one of those state-run nursing homes With one of those sadistic nurses Giving us high colonicsjust for laughs. Couldn't we take out a second on the house? We already took out a second, athird, afourth. Really? I should've married Bruce when I had the chance, And you should've married Julian. They were 93y- We never should've introduced them to each other. I don't wanna end up in one of those homes, Betty. Who does? Let's go home. Stop! Oh, god, did I hit another oat? I've got it. What? The answerto all our problems. Hey! Which one of you scumbags is Menhoffer and Smallwood? Looks like your luck's about to change. We're being transferred to a mental institution? The charges against you both were dropped this morning. Oh. those two helpless old ladies you guys tried to murder-- they left you this. Did hejust say murder? Oh...take awhiff, Len. Take awhiff. Mmm. Smells like paper. What's it say? Oh, man... Oh, mama... You're not gonna believe this! Lenny... Say your good-byes to these pathetic losers 'cause they just got cheated out of the best two asses In the whole damn prison. Guard? Guard? Are you sure this is the right address? Yeah. Yeah, this is it, all right. I got a bad feeling about this. Hey, wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Where you goin'? Where you goin'? Come on. Take your skirt off, baby. Let's go. Ifsjust two nice old ladies, huh? Just two...filthy rich, nice old ladies. I guess they did drop the charges. That's right. And they invited us to brunch. You think to apologize?

You go ahead. Go ahead. (this could be the start of something big playing) Oh, man... Is this place cool orvvhat? You're lookin'in someone's eyes You suddenly realize that this could be the start of something big Can you even begin to imagine the kind of erotic parties I could throw In a joint like this? Betty: hey- You two little jailbirds. Is that them? I think so. Which of you two elegant gentlemen Is Cal? These are for you, Miss Mundt. Oh. ..please. Call me Betty. Howvery asian of you. What?

Let's...let's go into the living room And sit. Um, I just wanna say I feel terrible About what I did to yourtesticles. They swelled up like grapefruit, ma'am.

Here you go. Got one. There was a... Hair on it. I retain water like the hoover dam. Have you ever seen the hoover dam? Betty: I have that kind of bloat. So, uh, howdoes it feel to be out and about? Well, ma'am, this may come as a complete surprise to you, But prison life... Isn't for everybody. Especially us. And I wouldjust like to say that Me and Cal are real sorry we tried to rob you In that filthy, filthy alley. You weren't planning on molesting us, were you? Molesting? With what? These boys are not molesters, Doris. They'rejust criminals. And Pmjust curious... Why the sudden change of heart, Miss Mundt? Betty is fine, Leonard. Hmmph! I'm so relieved to hearthat. You know, um, looking at those suits, I can only begin to imagine Howbrutal life has been for you. All you boys need Is one good break. That would be nice, Miss Mundt. Betty, Lenny. Your last name is Lenny? L gotta pee. I gotta pee in the house. I gotta pee, see? Down the hall and to the right. Oh, and don't forget to lift the seat Because we would hate to have any tinkle on ourtushies. Cal: Lenny, you wanna come with me? Oh, isn't it cute? They go to the bathroom togetherjust like girls. Marry Betty and Doris? The Mundt sisters? The two out there in the living room? I'm telling you. they're perfect. It's brilliant. It's the answerto all our problems. I'm gettin'that bad feeling again. Hey, hey, hey- Once we take that long, terrible walk Down the aisle and stammer out I do, We become the legal heirs to their entire estate. Now, stick with the plan. We marry them, we insure 'em And we kill 'em. You got that? Yes. Let me hear you say it. We marry 'em, insure 'em, then kill 'em. Perfect. They're lonely, wealthy women Lookin'for some lovin' In their waning, waning years. You think that's-- that's why they invited us here? A-and dropped the charges? Of course, Len. Are you kidding me? To broads like that, You and me are fresh, young meat Hot off the stud truck. They'll never go for it, Betty. We're too old. Speak foryourself. I happen to have-- shh! ...a body of a 20-year-old. Take a good look at these. Look at these fresh babies. In describing your babies, the word fresh does not come to mind. Dammit. We don't look any different than we did in 1965. We can do this. We have to do this. They're never gonna go for it. they're never gonna go for it. Len! those two women out there are wild about us! Listen to me. Our dreams of the good life-- No. Your dream of finding your one-and-only Ain't never coming true Till we got plenty of dough to burn. I mean, thafsjust the way it is. We've been handed the opportunity of a lifetime here. Will we have to hold hands with them? Yes. Do we have to see them naked? Yeah. Will we have to dance with 'em? Yes. Do we have to fornicate them? Yeah. Will we have to have Oral sex with them? Seniors are very oral. How long until they buy the farm? See, that's the brilliant part of it. I mean, did you see the way they walk? the way they breathe? Six months. A year at best. Now, we have to keep convincing them that we're rolling in dough. I know. Maybe we could showthem the movie. Ah... Everybody loves that movie. Nowyou're thinking. Oh, wow. Your own theater. Very cool. Betty: our old man was a real film buff. He built this himself Back in the late '30s. What did your old man do to make all this money? He stumbled on a product that's used today By practically everyone. All except the Catholics. Toilet paper? Catholics use toilet paper. Huh. What am I thinkin'of? You boy's will get a real kick out of this. Have a seat, fellas. Doris: so, what'd you think? Was the man in the movie really your father? Handsome, wasn't he? No. You guys must be worth millions. Doris: oh, who's counting. Let me show you afamily heirloom. This is the very first Mundt condom. It's so big. (snorts) oh, you think that's big?

(sobbing) You really loved her, didn't you, Len? I guess so. Yeah. You knowifs so like Betty and Doris To die in their sleep on the same night. Their little hearts calling it quits Within minutes of each other. We so looked forward to growing old with them. Len and I in our 80's... the girls in their 130's. Dammit, ifsjust not fair. Shit. (vacuum hums) You got a, uh... Got a line over like right there. (vacuum hums) We are gonna Miss them so much. (upbeat music playing) (laughter, chatter) What did I tell ya, Len?

Looks like you got yourself a keeperthere, my friend. Tell me something. Anything you want, baby. When was the last time you had passionate sex? With another person? With a beautiful woman who finds you irresistible. Well, there was one time-- No. No, never. Never, actually. Do you think Betty would mind if we made love right here Right now?. Who? Yourvvife. She's dead. Her body's not even cold yet. Well, I knowit would help to ease my pain, My suffering. I knowifs what Betty would've wanted. You are such a sensitive man. A golden god. A gift to all women. I know. Mmm...the things I'm gonna do to you. Oh, god, You are so hot. Your body is so tight. (snoring) (continues snoring) Cal: she draws me maps ofher erogenous zones. There's 933 points of interest. Well, at least she doesn't make you do weird stuff. Like, lick her pits. Zone 44. I've memorized them. It's not as bad for me, I guess. Dorisjust wants me to be food. I've been a cob salad, an ambrosia-- Don't you find it just a little bit odd that we all sleep in the same bed? I want you to see me! They're in better shape than I ever imagined. I'll go down here backwards. Would you like to see that? Going down and her are two things I really don't wanna ever hear again. No! I'm gonna do a swan dive! Are you watching? Yes!

(farts) (gasps) (coughing) I blacked out, Doris! I could've died. That's it. What's it? We have to kill them. Pickle? You mean. ..murder? See, murder is such an ugly word. Try to think of it more like-- More like self-defense. I don't know. Don't you wannafind your one true love, Len, huh? Don't you want that, huh? Yeah. Yeah. But to kill the girls? Betty's wearing me down, man. She's suckin'the lifeblood out of me. I'm tellin'you, if we don't do something drastic, like soon, You're gonna be scattering my ashes to the wind. Please, please. Forthe love ofgod And all that is good and decent, Just go with me on this, okay? Help me snuff out the girls. Betty: those life insurance policies Pay out only on the death ofour spouses. Howmuch rat poison? Four heaping tablespoons per quart. Howmuch is a quart? You need Martha Stewart to figure this out. This is just too hard, this recipe stuff. Can't we just wound him? Just slam him over the head with a mallet? I told you to leave your heart out of this. You are stressing me out! This is the first time I've ever killed anyone! And I need cooperation! It'sjust that I find Lenny so sexually attractive. Oh! Maybe it gets easierthe second time. Be a good accomplice. Have some compassion. Have some compassion for me. I have compassion. Don't I always show you compassion? Showcompassion nowand stirthis! Okay. I wanna kill him, and I don't wanna kill him. More rat poison. This is the last time I ever kill anyone with you. Hi. You sure the girls are upstairs? Yeah. they're-- they're in the kitchen. Okay. Didn't you think Doris' meatloaf was terrific? So tasty. I thought it was very dry. I told you to put gravy on it. Our cooking days are numbered, my friend. In a million years you'll never guess what this is. Chloroform? That's impressive, Len. How'd you know?. It's written right there on the label. Wow!. You know, I never read the label. So, you wanna kill 'em? No, just gonna knock 'em unconscious. It'll be easierto finish offthejob lfthey're not squirming around. Isn't there away that we could put them into Like a permanent coma or something? Only death is permanent. Who knows with a coma? You and I could be livin'up the good life And then shazaam! they're eyes pop open! Won't they smell it? No. See, that's the genius of it. It's completely odorless. Here. Check it out. (sniffs deeper) It--it smells like somebody's feet. What? Whose feet? (slurring) I don't smell anything. You're a genius, Cal. (giggles) I know, buddy. I know. Do you think murder is unethical? No. then I don't either. As aristotle once said, When life throws you a lemon, Sometimes you just gotta up and kill somebody. Did you make this lemonade? No. the girls made it this morning Before they headed out to their gynecologist. They're not pregnant are they? Bite yourtongue, man! Oh, good afternoon, Mr. Wu. Thirsty. Very thirsty. Oh. Um... Yeah. Thank you. thank you. Oh, chug. Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug. Chug. Hey, hey! Whoo! thank you. All right. Whoo hoo! See what I did? 'cause I went whoo! And his name's Woo. Oh, yeah! (chuckling) Oh, hey, you want some? No, no. Lemonade always tastes like camel piss to me. It's got the-- no, thank you. I've always been much more of a, uh, Passion fruit- ice tea man myself. Those are good, but they always give you the runs. They're good, though. What kind ofham you got there? Is that, like, smoked ham or is it regular? I believe it's regular. I think they smoked my ham And I don't like it smoked. Think we could trade? Oh, yeah. Yeah. That'll be okay? I'm fine with that. Switch it out? What kind of bread you got there? Same bread as you. All right, I'll pass it off then. It's nasty. I'm not a big smoke guy. They're smokideverything nowadays, have you noticed? (loud muttering) Looks like Mr. Woo wants more lemonade. All gone, Woo. Poured down drain, Mr. Woo. Down drain. All gone, Woo-Woo. All gone. Hi. Hi! Hi. That musfve been some sweet-tastifilemonade. I bet it was. PoorWoo. What about mrs. Woo and all the little woos? Medic said it looked like a massive heart attack. You should know that he absolutely loved your lemonade. (gasps) Nobody bagged grass like Woo. Could he shape a bush! (snoring) I'm going insane, Lenny. You wannafly a plane? Insane. Insane! Oh. Insane. Just kill her already. You can do it, Cal. I love you. (farting) (farting continues) (snoring continues) Shut the door, shut the door! Come here, come here, come here, come here. Are they still sleeping? Yeah. I feel faint. Dizzy. My stomachs upset. Maybe Pmjust hungry. Are you sure this is gonnawork? This baby is a can't-Miss. We're sure to get at least one of them. I hope it's Betty. Nowlisten to me. We have to make it look like atypical household accident. That's the key to afirst-class murder. Okay? Come here. Here's what I did. I added a little motor oil to the petroleumjelly. It's kinda like my own little recipe. I call it death by invisible goo. Okay. It's gonna be like a slip 'n slide in there. Do you know that more people are killed every year In their bathrooms than on our nation's highways? Oh, yeah. It's a deathtrap in here. It's crazy, it's crazy. Do you think there's gonna be a lot of blood? That's the hope, buddy. There we go. That oughta do it. Nowall we have to do is make an excuse to leave the house. When we come back, we play it up big time for the oops. I'm a genius. I can't believe this is what a guy has to go through nowadays To earn a buck. Hey, hey, you just remember that society's to blame forthis, okay? It's their rules that drove us to this desperate place. All we evervvanted was just the best life had to offer. You know, without havin'to work for it. No one told me life would be like this Nowl knowa hell on earth exists You'll never know what I've been through Shouldn't there be paramedics? This is very disappointing. Very disappointing. Hi. Missed you. What took you so long? Did you get the prunes? Please, tell me you got the prunes. Aren't you ladies usually showered And ready to take on the day by this point? The drain's all clogged again. One of you sheds like a dog. I still don't understand. What does that have to do With you guys taking a showerthis morning? We will, once he removes that giant hairball. Who exactly are we talking about? The plumber. Betty: He just got here afewminutes ago. (plumber screaming, glass shattering) (gasps) the guy I bought it from Said it hasn't been fed in weeks. Are you absolutely positive this is gonnawork? I'm sure it'll work. It's bound to kill at least one of them. Well, I hope it's Cal. (snake hissing) there you go. Tell me when it's over. You tell me when it's over. Betty: oh, my god. Are they dead? (snoring) (rattling) I hear it went straight for his weenie. Maybe it mistook it for another snake. I once asked him If I could borrowa cup of sugar. He told me to go sorewmyself. I'm so glad I forgave him. Can you see anything, Cal? Not really. It's pretty dark. Are these gonna be loud? You've been to the movies before, haven't ya? Betty: Perfect. they're sleeping like babies. I can't do this. If Lenny ever-found out it was me, He would be so hurt. Okay. I'll kill yours, you kill mine. I don't think this is gonna look like much ofan accident. It might be a little more complicated To talk ourvvay out of, But I don't see any other choice. This seems a bit extreme. I think effective is a bettervvord. Here. I thought these might come in handy. I thought these might make the task a bit more pleasant. I think I'm gonna puke. It'll all be over soon enough. Ready? No. Okay, good. You ready? What? Are you ready? Not really, no. Okay. Good. On three. One... Two... three! I'm sorry about this whole tryin'to kill you thing. Ah, this kind of thing always happens to me. It was Cal's idea. It was Betty's idea. Whipped cream? Thank you. Friends like that are hard to come by these days. You're so caring, so unselfish. They're both insane, but brilliant. Brilliant. Why did you want to kill me? Why? Yes. Why? Why did I want to kill you? I wanted to kill you 'cause I wanted to have some fun. Okay? I want a blonde nymphomaniac With perky breasts and long, tanned legs And atight little ass. Oh. Oh, yes. And young. See, that's the key word here, baby-- Young...as in not old! Nowwhat is that? I mean, it's nothing personal. Killing me is one thing, But you hurt my feelings. You tried to kill me. You don't think that hurt my feelings?! Yes, it's true, I admit it, But the difference is that it was never an afterthought. I planned on killing you right from the beginning. Oh, howromantic! There should be awarning label Attached to every one of you broads. And my ass is little And my breasts are perky. Ask anyone. Yeah. I'll get right on that. We took these right afteryou threwup On the roller coaster. I dry heaved for nearly a half an hour. This one you look nauseous, and this one you look dead. Those were the days, all right. So...besides all the lies and the deceits And the trying to kill each other stuff, Don't you think we made a pretty good couple? There's not a person alive who doesn't think at one time or another About killing their spouse. I think it's a sign of a healthy relationship. Would you like some more syrup? Yes. Maple or boysenberry? You choose. You're so trusting. You son of a bitch bastard! You used me! My bottle! Don't you dare throvvthat. Huh? Is that all you got? Huh? Is that-- Come on, Betty. Right here, Betty. Right here, Betty! Hung like a stallion, huh? A four-year-old has got more meat between his legs. Howdare you insult my privates?! You want a piece of me? I'll kick your ass. (gasps) you're gonnafight me? I'm a woman, I'm practically in my 50's, And you're gonnatake me on? That's right. Come on. Flying wasp. Come on. Come on! I bet if we would've met under better circumstances, things might've been different. Yeah. Maybe we would've fallen in love for real. That would've been nice. I've never been in love. As I was staring across the bed through the haze of the shotgun smoke, I realized at that moment that my desperate search for my true love, My soul mate, Might be oloserthan I ever realized. You are referring to me, right? Yes. If I said I love you, Doris Mundt, Would you believe me? Do you believe it, Len? I mean, I'm not anyone real special. I don't want anyone real special. You know, we're not exactly real close in age. I mean, when you were in the fourth grade, I was probably in... the tenth. Age is just a number-for people foolish enough To let it come between them. Oh, god, that's the most beautiful thing I ever heard. I know. I can't believe I said it. Would you mind If I kissed you? Sorry I beat you like that. Thanks for helping me stop the bleeding. We have an announcement to make. Me and Lenny are in love. For real this time. Oh, that's so nice. Is what I just heard the truth, buddy? Are you really in love? I mean, with yourvvife? You rva/ife?! She's it, all right. She's the one. Then I'd say it's a good thing we didn't blovvtheir heads off. I wannathank you, Cal. You always promised You'd help me find her, And you came through just like I knewyou would. I'm happy for you, buddy. I really am. Before we break out the champagne, Which we ain't got, May I remind you that love don't pay the bills. Betty's got a point. Dammit! Hovvthe hell can your uncle Walt Go and steal all your money like that? I just told you. We were so naive. I know that he's got millions ofour dough Stashed away inside that big, fat safe of his. Have you ladies ever heard of a little someone Named lee harvey oswald? Why? Are you related? No, but my foster parents were sure I'd end upjust like him. Spit it out, Cal. What are you proposing? I'm proposing we do what, in my business, We call a little of the old b and e. That's breaking and... E? Exiting? Exiting. Good, Len. Breaking and exiting. You mean rob uncle Walt? What have we got to lose? Nowhe's got a point. I think he has a point. Yeah, I think so. But I'm not sure. So? What do you say? Are you with me or are you against me? Are you in or are you out? With you all the way, Cal. (groaning and grunting) (bones creaking) Does anyone feel Something magical is about to happen here? Anyone? (brakes squeal) It looks different at night. Scarier. Doris: he's right. I'm getting second thoughts. Hey, we signed offon the plan. It's a good plan; a damn good plan. It's a solid plan. I think it's aturn-on. Let's rock. Okay, quiet like mice, people.

Go, go, go, go. (horn honks) TV: ...of the 6th of January, 1943, Supreme allied commander General Eisenhower Greets the men of the... there it is, Just like I always remembered. I've never even heard of a coal chute before. I told you. It dates back to the turn of the century. We used to play in it when we were kids. Ha ha ha, that's great. Can we stay focused, please, people? I'm afraid of the dark. Don't worry. the dark will help to hide the rats. Ah! Did he say rats? Did I volunteerforthis? Maybe we shouldjust rethink this. All right. Lower. (Doris continues muttering) Okay, let her go. (yelling) (Doris screaming) Great balls! (TVoontinues) (rustling) (Whimpers) What is it, boy? Spit it out. Who? (barks) Nazis?! Nazis.

Is that what I heard you say-- nowwhat? Howabout go to the front door and lettin'us in? Are you okay, sweetheart? I took a leak in my pants. Patton called me a pussycat.

(TVoontinues) (crystals olinking) that was just to let you know We mean business, old man. Mr. Walter van Mundt, if that is your name, Me and my associates ain't here To play a game of hopscotch. Wipe that smile offyourface, Or I'll blowit off. Hey, hey! Don't you look away from me when I'm talkin'to you. Nowlisten up good, old man. I'm gonna ask you this one time and one time only. What's the combination to the safe? What's the combination?! He is some cool customer. He's dead. What?! As in not alive? We've murdered the old bastard. I have killed so many people. Well, dammit to hell! We've got to revive him right now Or my master plan is in seriousjeopardy here. Don't just stand there; help us. Come on. Tickle him or something. Hey! Hey, war guy! Betty: So do you have any ideas about what we should do? I vote for gettin'the hell outta here. Failure is not in my vocabulary. Howabout quitting? Come on, we came here tonight to get our money, And we're not leavin'without it. A good thief is always prepared With a sound backup plan. Watch the rug. He's got a lot of heads in this house. Boy, he's a heavy bastard, all right. Gives you awhole newappreciation Forthose in the moving business. You think the oops will buy this? Sure, sure, sure, sure. Ifsjust gotta look like an accident; Like he tripped and fell down the stairs. Stairs are actually a common deathtrap to the elderly. A lot of people don't know that. Spin him around, spin him around. Got him? Okay, prop him up, prop him up. We're gonna do this on three, okay? One... Two...three. Yeah, well, uh... that was... Unexpected . Okay. Let's go, boys and girls. Got a date with a safe. That's a big boy, all right. We're rich. Not so fast. Nowlet's get this straight, Cal. You're gonna do what to what? Rip the door off. Rip the door off?! That's correct. Are you experienced In this ripping the door off business? No. Well, I...no. And may I ask Just what tools you're going to use To rip the door off? One extra-long chain, One pea-green Cadillac convertible, And this brain. I don't think so. He can do it. Are you sure, honey? No. Lenny... Bring up the chain. Just like taking candy from a baby. Let me knowwhen you're in position. Over. Over. I'm in position. Say over afteryou finish, not before. Over. Gotcha. Over. Turn her over. Over. Okay, put the pedal to the metal, good buddy. Let's do it! (gasps) (loud rumbling) She's giving way. Come on! Give it all you got, Len. What the fuck? Ramming speed, Lenny. (groaning) You bastards. Stop! Stop! The brake, Lenny. Hit the brake! Uncle Walt? What the shit?! Stop, you maniac! Oh! Hello? Cal? anybody? Over. Doris: thank god he's dead. This would've really upset him. Walt's body's not downstairs. Wouldn't worry...

Oh, and happiness. Lenny and Doris settled into suburbia Where her art flourished, Winning the praises oftwo local critics. They even took in Bruno, uncle Walfs beloved dog. He's like a hairy, vicious child to them. As for uncle Walt, We tried to get his ashes entombed At arlington national cemetery, But he was flatly rejected, So we did the next best thing. Semperfi, uncle Walt. Semperfi. As for me, well, I guess one could say that, in my case, crime did pay... Rather beautifully. I missed you. I was just in the bathroom. Always take me with you-- promise me. Whateveryou want, baby. You know what you are? A golden god? A gift to all women. I know. Howmuch did you say you're worth again? $5,655,422. Give ortake. But it's not all tied up in stocks and bonds, is it? That's cash, baby. The things I'm gonna do to you. And don't think I forgot about Betty. We decided being friends was much better than being husband and wife. And I must confess that Miss Betty Mundt is one hell ofawoman.
