You lit a cigarette, and you're not smoking it. I'm trying to quit. So it's kind of a crutch. I'm an addict, okay? It's a crutch. Kind of like having two drinks a night. I'm not an addict. Sure you are. Let's review. Why didn't you review before I got here? I did, but now I'm gonna review With you. Why is this so hard? Are you still having two drinks a night? - Yes. - Ever break your rule? Couple of times. Couple of times in two years? - More or less. - More? Or less. Last time we talked, You said that, uh, were seeing someone. - I was. - You said you liked her. I still do. So, you're still seeing her? I am not. Have you talked to your wife? Ex-wife. I'm sure that's in there, And no, I have not talked to Jenn. But you wanted to. Old habit. I used to talk to her every day. So, why'd you stop? I ripped the phone out of the wall. Why'd you rip the phone out of the wall? Because it was pathetic. So, since you stopped talking to her, - You've gotten drunk a couple of times. - No. I got drunk a couple of times since I stopped seeing you. And why are you seeing me now? Because I got drunk a couple of times Since I stopped seeing you. Ay. You are a subversive son of a bitch. Nothing happens here. You did too good A job cleaning up dodge. I lost my conscience. That's definitely not in here. You lost your conscience. Is that kind of a feeling you got? - Yes. - And you're frightened. I've been afraid of half the things I ever did. But you're frightened now? Yes. Because? Because I lost my conscience. (sighs) (inhales sharply) (exhales) (classical music playing) (sighs) (waves crashing) Fate wouldn't do this to me. (sighs) Took so long to acknowledge a connection, Admit there was a bond. Life plays tricks on you. (birds singing) oh, oh, oh oh... ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh... ooh, ooh, ooh ooh... ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh ooh... ooh, ooh, ooh... (birds singing) ooh, ooh, ooh ooh... ooh, ooh, ooh ooh... ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh... (indistinct chatter, phone ringing) (footsteps approaching) It's done. Healy signed off? He did. I don't know why you need paper. I only work from paper. How's the weather in florida? He described it as predictable. Did he seem upset that I interrupted his vacation? I interrupted his vacation, and he seemed grateful. Must be staying with his in-laws. Last time got complicated-- healy's words. Lieutenant greenstreet, Under these rather unique circumstances, How do I address you? As sydney. As sydney, jesse. Jesse. This is complicated. My words. I'm undermanned. That's sad. Anyway, the price was right. Why would you work for expenses, jesse? I still get my pension from L.A. Homicide. I don't need the money. I need the work. This is a small sampling of open cases. Some cold, some recent but cold. Take your pick. Thank you. Raise your right hand. You're kidding. Well, last time, you ran away with the consultant thing. Let's make it official. (sighs) I... State your name. I, jesse stone. Do solemnly swear I will well and truly serve... Jesse: Do solemnly swear that I will well and truly serve The united states of america And the state of massachusetts... (distant horns honking) (guitar playing slow jazz) (crowd chatter) - Scotch neat. - Sure. (sighs) Mm. help me, please have mercy on a fool like me so unwise still i plead darling save your love for me... you can have fun with the crowd but for crying out loud... darling please save... your love... for me... (song ends) (applause) Thank you. Hello, jesse. (sighs) Hello, thelma. Thanks, sam. I think I owe you an explanation. You don't owe me anything, Thelma. How'd you know where to find me, Jesse? I pulled a guy over, a drunk, And he says, "you remember that babe who sold used cars "at hasty's tasty's? She's singing at a club in Boston." You think I'm a babe, Jesse? No. Yes. You sing like an angel. So you came here with a purpose? Yes. What purpose? I'm thinking about buying a car. I don't do that anymore. When the feds shuttered hasty's place... ...I ran away. From paradise? From you. You miss me? No more than I would my eyes. You're a curious man. You're gonna make every guy you meet A little bit curious. Jesse, I want you to know... I'm seeing someone, Jesse. Okay. My ex. Okay. I understand. I do. (grunts) You sing like an angel. (thunder rumbling) (sighs) (sighs) (sighs) (line ringing) Hi, it's Ienn. It's Jesse. I'm not in, but your call is important to me. Please leave a message. (beep) (sighs) (gulls calling) (grunts) (grunts) (sighs) (groans softly) (light buzzing) (sighs) (sighs, grumbles) (grunts) (knob squeaks, water stops) (sighs) You're late. You didn't answer my texts. I don't text. You're a dinosaur. The average kid On social media has an attention span of eight seconds. That's one second less than a goldfish. If you say so. I missed my train. Why'd you miss your train? I had my dinner in a bottle of scotch. I need this job, sydney. Anything else you need? I need a car. Why do you need a car? As you well know, Last time I used my police cruiser to work in boston, I got suspended. Internal affairs wasn't your calling, By the way. Homicide is. I don't like the train. Lets me think too much. I'll get you a car. Thank you, Sydney. You're welcome, Jesse. I don't know why I put that one in there. - You want certainty. - Well, We think we have the guy. - You think? - Yes. You think your way to a guess or a hunch-- That's not certainty. An assumption isn't proof. That's why you put it in there. Well, why'd you pick it? The boston ripper case Made a lot of headlines. What happened to the dog? What dog? This dog. Sitting next to his owner's body. (clears throat) Uh... (chuckles) Dogs can't talk, Jesse. No, but they listen pretty good. We need to get something straight. Okay. I'm not healy. I know that. I never slept with healy. (sighs) you're a bad boy. I am. (creaking) (chains rattling) Hello, richard. I like to talk with my hands. It's okay. (keys jangle) You're a tough guy. I'm tough enough. The hat. What's with the hat? You got juice. I do. Sit down. You don't talk much. I never found out anything by listening to myself. What do you think of my work? Your work? What do you think of my avocation? Your procedure is singular. I'll take that... As a compliment. Jesse. You're very skilled at this, Jesse. I am. Are you the good cop Or the bad cop? That's not worthy of you, Richard. I'm both. Your fourth victim. I don't like that word. What word would you prefer? "recipient." And I only have three. You only confessed to three. "in summary, The fourth victim..." Sorry, Richard, that's what it says here. "the fourth victim "was killed in exactly "the same manner as the first three. Prior to "the evisceration, the initial entry into the abdomen "was identical. "as the specific details of the method "were held in strictest confidence and all four victims "were prostitutes, it was concluded "that the same assailant had to be responsible For all four murders." I don't like that word. What would you call it? A public service. Who wrote that? The arresting detective. Daniel Steven Leary. An irish bricklayer of a detective. He's a decorated police officer. Almost got a rise out of you, Jesse. I'll be diplomatic. He doesn't share your gift. There's a profound reason why you're here, jesse. Stay with this. Find out who did it. I'm tired. You never told me what you thought of my work. I think you're a sick son of a bitch And you should already be dead. Thanks, Laura. Man: Feed a cold, Starve a fever. Suit. Guess you didn't have a fever. My sense is, you don't even have a cold. Another one, Jesse? Only one more. And what can I get you, Luther? Usual, Laura. Papaya and cranberry. Straight up. How'd you know where to find me? Small town. What else do you know? That you're not sick. I called yesterday and twice today. I went to Boston. You went to boston today? And yesterday. Thanks, Laura. Papaya and cranberry. I'll get my check. My sense is, you're working on something big. You got a feeling. You were thinking about it when I came in. I know how you get when you're on to something. You go inside yourself. I can help, Jesse. Somebody's got to run the shop. And I got a lot of vacation time coming. Nothing happens here. Crime could be just around the corner. All right. I went to Boston... To work for Healy. I didn't say that. I went to Boston to... To follow a trail. You're finishing my sentences again. Sorry, Jesse. I went to Boston to-- I'm a little embarrassed about this-- To enroll in some university classes... In police investigation. In the psychology of living alone. Say no more. I understand. You didn't take your police cruiser to Boston. The train. I like the train. Lets me think. What do you think you'll be doing in ten years? Who cares? I know who you are. You didn't answer my question. I did. I said I don't care. No, you said "who cares?" so who cares? I care. In ten years, you'll be... Well, in ten years, If you're sitting on that wall, smoking dope, I'd arrest you. But you wouldn't arrest a confused 13-year-old girl. Where'd you get it? My mom has A prescription, so it's legal. It's legal for her. It's illegal for you. Did she give it to you? No. So you stole it. What's your name? If you make one up, I'll know. How? I'm the police chief, I know everything. Jenny O'neill. You said you were confused. What about? My mom says you're a drinker. Small town. Why is drinking right and smoking dope wrong? I'm not in the right and wrong business. I'm in the legal and illegal business. Tell you what. I won't Arrest you if you go back to school right now. Don't have a note. I'll call your mom. (scoffs) she won't answer. I'll call your principal. I appreciate you seeing me, Mr. Davies. I hate to put you through this. Then why do you have to? Well... As I think you know, We do have a person of interest In your wife's murder. Richard steele. Yes, yes, I know. The man the press call The boston ripper. Catchy title. And they like catchy titles. The coroner's report on your wife is virtually Identical to the three murders That Richard Steele confessed to. But he denies any involvement In Mrs. Davies' death. What does this have to do with paradise, chief Stone? Absolutely nothing. I have an extensive background in homicide. The state homicide commander brought me in To see if we could close the books on this. Mavis' killer is already in prison. That was never proven. I don't think there is one person In boston who doesn't know the ugly details of this mess. Well, the details employed by the killer Were never made public, Mr. Davies. I'm talking about Mavis' sideline. I found out my wife was a prostitute in the papers. Do you have any idea what that's like? I do not. Well, I... I certainly made enough money. Why would she choose that? That's a shrink question. And mavis can't talk. Marital problems? Excuse me? Often a change in behavior Can be triggered by marital problems. I told everything I know to detective leary. Please. I kind of like to hear it from the horse's mouth, so to speak. Marital problems. Our marriage was perfect. I see. Would you have a personal photograph of mavis That I could have? The way I work on these things, It would help me. I destroyed every photograph of Mavis. Okay. Have you come across any new information Or had any new ideas that might be relevant? Yes, I have, Chief Stone. I have no intention of helping you open me up To another round of that public circus. Okay. May I see your dog? That was Mavis' dog. And I might as well have been on mars when I was in his presence. I tried with that dog. I had to give him to animal services for adoption. He was a source of hurt. Like the photographs. That's right. Good for you. Sorry. Chief Stone, this is detective Dan Leary. - Hi. - Hi. Hope I'm not stepping on any toes here. You're not. It's officially an open case, And Mavis Davies deserves justice, Just like the other Three victims. You know that Richard Steele will say or do anything To keep his name in the paper. That was my take. There isn't a day goes by That I don't ask myself why I couldn't give her justice. Don't beat yourself up. Five. Excuse me? That's the number of open cases I had in L.A. That I still carry around. Five. Is there a reason that you landed on this one? I don't know. Something this brutal, This premeditated, requires consequence. I'd like to work with you on this. You will not. Your plate's full, detective. You said Mavis Deserves justice like the other three. Clearly you think they're related. I do. All four were hookers, All four were killed exactly the same way. You'll keep me up to date? - We will. Thanks, dan. - Okay, Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. Good luck. The murders stopped, Jesse. So you think mavis belongs To richard steele. What was the motive, Sydney? We're never gonna know that. For any of them, you know that. Husband could have had one If he knew she was a hooker before she was murdered. - You talked to him. - I did. What do you think? He's hurt enough, he's angry enough. I want detailed daily reports On this investigation, Chief Stone. Jesse. You have a short leash on this, Jesse. (phone rings) Hello. Jesse: Crime could be just around the corner. I didn't wake you, did i? I know you're a night owl, So I figured you'd be up. Exactly. I was up, Jesse. I met a kid today on the way out of town. She was sitting on a wall, Smoking pot. Who is she? Her name's Jenny O'neill. She lives in paradise. What'd you do? Well, I sent her Back to school, but... But your coply intuition says there's more to it. Exactly. There was something in the way She reacted when I mentioned her mother. Could you pay her mom a visit? Oh, I might be able to free up some time. Could you do it in a way that doesn't raise any red flags? You know, like you're following up on a... Public disturbance in the neighborhood? There you go. I'm sure I can check with the school. I got to go. (starts engine) What's this about? I ca You can't tell me? - That's correct. Clearly, the dog has issues. Jesse: What's his name? Steve. I do not understand Why people must anthropomorphize their canine partners. There's comfort in it. I'm interested in this dog. I'm sorry. Steve is scheduled. For adoption? Goodness, no. He's scheduled. As I said, the dog has issues. He stopped eating And he's unresponsive. You're putting him down? We prefer to think of it As the canine is moving on to a better place. What place is that? May I see your badge? It's in a drawer. Here's my card. Sydney, this is highly unusual. Actually, it's not my card. It's the state homicide commander's card. She will explain my credentials. Oh, never mind. (sighs) (insects trilling) (dog toenails clicking on floor) (sighs) (sighs) (sighs) I don't see a need for this distraction. I will be brief. Just so you know, I consider my work a calling. A vital, if, uh, underappreciated calling. Good for you. So, lieutenant Greenstreet has some doubt About Richard Steele being involved With the fourth Boston ripper case. I didn't say that. Your presence implies it. It does not, And I do not speak for lieutenant Greenstreet. Richard Steele was not charged with The murder of Mavis Davies. He only confessed to the first three, So her murder is unresolved, as I'm sure you know. As I'm sure you know, chief Stone, The specific details of the killer's method were not Released to the public. No one else could have reproduced them. The same man Committed all four of those murders. I would stake my reputation on it. You already have. Look, the method of restraint, The depth and angle of the wound, The length and strength of the upward stroke, and... The murders have stopped. Everybody says that, and you don't seem To draw a conclusion from that fact in your report. That is not my job. No, it's mine. There was no toxicology report On Mavis Davies in the file. Oh, damn it! He won't mind. I think we're done here. I'm sorry, but it appears you did toxicology On the first three victims, but not Mavis. Toxicology would be a standard requirement On a case like this. Well, it's not in the file, evan. Well, I'm not the keeper of the files. Good lord, chief stone, for a man who's supposed To be so clever, you act like an idiot. That's one way to be clever. And you don't seem upset by that. By a lost test result. No. (sighs) Because... Both: The murders have stopped. You're telling me you came forward And confessed to three murders Right after the fourth one hit the papers. Why would you do that, Richard? I wasn't about to share my legacy, Jesse. Your legacy? My choice of words Troubles you, doesn't it, Jesse? Not really. What's troubling is that it doesn't trouble you. These people feed off the worst in us. They pollute their bodies with poison And prey on the innocent. That's how you see it. That's how we should all see it. That's why turning myself in was worth the sacrifice. That sacrifice would be? My work wasn't finished. Your first three were black, Mavis was white. Did that trouble you? Please. That is not my deal, Jesse. What is your deal, Richard? It would be wrong for me to take credit For something I didn't do. Wouldn't be ethical. You still don't understand, do you? I'd be ashamed if I did. (scoffs) Good luck with your problem, jesse. I don't have a problem. Sure you do. (seagulls screeching) (phone beeps) (phone ringing) well, the dinner is on a friday. Oh, of course. (laughs) Excuse me, father. Ah. (phone beeps) Hello, Jesse. We on for tomorrow night? We are. If you think it's a bad idea, We don't have to. Do you think it's a bad idea, Jesse? Why would I think it's a bad idea? Okay, listen, I'll see you tomorrow night. (phone beeps) (suv engine revs) (tires screeching) (thudding) (hissing, retreating engine revving) Where are you, Jesse? Nowhere. Sorry. Understood. Didn't eat your steak. I'm afraid I can't. My sense is, you're thinking about reggie. Kind of. You were the first on the crime scene that night. What'd you think When you saw reggie sitting next to his owner's body? I wished he could talk. Dogs can't talk. Jenny's mom's a mess. How bad? She was drunk. Not falling down drunk, But just the same. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. Do you now? I've seen it in my mom. I see. Any time her mother talked about Jenny, there was an edge. Do you think she knows why you were really there? My sense is she does not. Then she doesn't. What do you want me to do next? Get me everything you can on the mother. On it. (insects chirring, soft rhythmic chiming) (key clicking in lock) Steak. (smacks his lips) - You checking up on me? - Jesse. You checking up on me, Jesse? No. I'm just sitting here, thinking. You ever talk to your father? I don't know who my father is. Okay. How's school? School sucks. Lot of things suck. What happened? My mom loves me. Say it like you mean it. I hate it there. You hate it where? Home. I wouldn't want to make you late for school. (sighs) I need a car. I got you a car. It's leaking oil And overheating. - Not my job. - Might have something To do with being pushed off the road back to paradise. - You had an accident? - I'm not sure. Tell me something, Jesse. You don't look as though I could, Sydney. Is there something I should know? Could you run down the car for me? Did you get a license number? I always get the license number. Car was stolen yesterday morning. I guess that explains the hit and run. And you have reason to believe it wasn't an accident. I didn't say that. Could you pull up Mavis Davies? There was no toxicology report in her physical file. Not here, either. The M.E. implied he did one. Implied? As much as said so. He is steeped in bureaucratic belligerence. Your point? I think it's been scrubbed. Oh, Sydney. No, Jesse. Yes, boss. Not ethical. I was just reminiscing. Getting back to reality for a moment. I will only go as a visitor. I talked to Richard Steele again. Any insight? - Other than I needed to take a shower? He's relentless. Insists he had nothing to do with Mavis' murder. Yeah, tell me something I don't know. If you don't like the answers you're getting, Check your premises. Sister mary john: Most hookers are junkies. The streets are rough, their pimps are rough. Why'd you want to know? You know more hookers than I do. That came out wrong. I know what you meant, Jesse. Most of my girls aren't hookers. I know that. - And not all hookers are junkies. Though a lot are. Anyway, rehab's not my business. Love and support is my business. How's business? - Robust. Funds are not, But we have our angels. Gino fish is a benefactor, but he's no angel. No, he's not. At least in the biblical sense. It's good to see you, Jesse. And you. It's been a while. It has. How you doing with the nun thing? Doing good. I'm good. Honestly? - Please. - Well, There are times-- this is stupid-- When I hear this voice in my ear, and it turns out To be my sunday school teacher sitting on my shoulder. What's he say? Honestly? Again, yes. He says, "you sure as hell "better have a damn good reason for this 'cause you're not supposed to have dinner with a nun." We enjoy each other's company. That's a good reason. Thank you. You gonna finish that? It was delicious, but no. (microwave whirring) (ding) You believe in fate? Dix: - No. - I think I do. You think? Know but can't prove. The dog speaks to me. - Dogs don't talk. - No, But he's speaking to me. When I see this picture Of a dog who kind of looks like reggie Sitting next to his owner's body-- well... What's this dog's name? Steve. Dix: Unusual name for a dog. Jesse: It is. If you don't like the answers you're getting, Check your premises. Did you tell me that? I don't think so. I must have thought it. You're talking a lot today. Going easy on me? There's a hard part. Your cop hat still on? It is, and we have some time. Okay. The murders have stopped. That seems to be enough for a lot of people. - Greenstreet? - I don't think so. Murders could have stopped for a lot of reasons. Okay. What have you got? I got Richard Steele. He's a sick son of a bitch, but he seems To have some sort of code of conduct. I hope you're not looking for a motive. It'll drive you nuts. We can't know. And the guy's doing life, so what difference does it make? Clearly, a lot to him. It's not uncommon For a sick son of a bitch like him to have a standard. Don't chase this, Jesse. The dog speaks to me. You're not walking The street when you're walking the dog. If you're not getting the answers you want, Check your premises. All the victims were prostitutes. Steele confessed to murdering three. Steele had to commit the fourth murder Because no one else knew the killer's methods. The last one is a false assumption. Some people knew. (buzzer sounds) Woman: Yeah? Mrs. O'neill? I'm not married. I'm Chief Stone. I know who you are. Can we talk? I got nothing to say. I'm not here As a police chief. This is just between you and me. Jenny doesn't know I'm here. May I come in? You're on your way to losing your daughter. You're starting early. I'm not going anywhere. You know what I'm talking about. What's that supposed to mean? It means you lost your last job 'cause you're a drunk. It means your unemployment is running out soon, and i hope It means you can see the bottom. You don't know what you're talking about. Paradise is a small town. I think you know I'm an expert on the subject. The subject? Being a drunk. Oh. Well, you can't know how I feel. Don't kid a kidder. I know how you feel. Jenny's father isn't even a memory. You're her mother. My mom died when I was eight. Mothers are important. Oh, what's this? You can call it a voucher. If that offends you, let's just say It's a scholarship. You can only use it In one place. That's in there. His name is Dr. Dix. (sighs) There was a time I didn't like any part of me. Now, on my good days, I'm okay. You don't have any good days. You live long enough, You have regrets. And the ones that nag at you the most Are the ones where you knew you had a choice. Last time I saw Jenny, she had a mark on her left cheek. You right-handed? If I see something, if I so much as feel something, I will come back here with my police chief hat on, And you will go to jail, And Jenny... With regret... Will be on her way to a foster home. Hello, Amanda. Chief Stone. - Jesse. Mr. Fish is waiting for you, Chief Stone. I know our last meeting didn't go very well, And I see you're still upset. I'm sorry. I questioned your intentions. You asked me why. And I said I've kissed a few frogs in my day. Are you a frog, Jesse? I don't think so. Perhaps you'd let me make it up to you over a cup of coffee. There's no education in the second kick of a mule. I see. (beeping) (click) I'm... Very sorry, Amanda. Just coffee. Jesse. Jesse. Jesse Stone. - Gino Fish. - We remember Each other's names After all this time. Two years. You've been counting. Where have you been? Fighting crime. I missed our little talks. As have I. New digs. Keep moving forward. It's a little like changing your password. Have you heard from hasty Hathaway? I know of no such person. That's not why you're here. Do I need a reason? You always have a reason, Jesse Stone. With hasty gone... I know of no such person. With the disappearance of this... Mr. Hathaway, Paradise has remained remarkably Crime-free. I'm doing some housecleaning For state homicide. You're taking Odd jobs. This job isn't odd. It's what I do. The Boston ripper murders. An unspeakable horror. Thankfully, those murders were solved. The murder of mavis davies is an open investigation. But the killings have stopped. Everybody says that. I need a favor, gino. Well, there's your reason, Jesse Stone. I need a name. Who's running the top call girls in this town? (sighs) We've known each other a long time now. Clearly, I have no need for call girls. I know that. Perhaps on your dark side. I'm just a boxing promoter. Perhaps in the course of doing business a client had a need. That would be illegal. You're enjoying making this difficult. The reward is always in the journey. Mavis Davies was carved up while she was alive. If the killer Is still out there, This could happen again. I'll see what I can find out. (sighs) June? I came here... You came here With a good reference Or we wouldn't be talking. I was... Just a minute. (sighs, mutters) Okay, let's get something straight here. I operate a legitimate escort service. Now, if one of my girls chooses To go extracurricular, that's on them. Understood. Mavis Davies. That was horrible. And she was a nice kid. Well, I mean, all I can tell you is she wasn't working for me That night. I didn't think so. (phone buzzing) Did you know she was married? Uh, no. I don't want to know anything about my girls' private lives. Was there ever any kind of incident With any of her clients? No. No. Totally satisfied customers. (phone buzzing) (grunts) Select escorts. Uh, oh, well, no, I'm afraid That she doesn't work here anymore. Perhaps I could suggest someone else? I see. Well, please, uh, try us again. (chuckles) The gift that keeps on giving. Charlotte-- she was one Of my best girls. But she was very close to mavis, and... And the murder just absolutely just freaked her out. Yeah. She quit. Do you know where I might find her? All I can say is that there was a client Who thought that he saw her. You know, she was hostessing for some beachfront caf Up the coast. Quite a step down, huh? Do you have a picture? I can do better than that. (rain falling outside) (sighs) (sighs) (sighs) (grunts) (sighs) (insects trilling) (sighs) (grunts) Hi, I'm Mavis. I know it's hard to meet new people. I know because I'm in the same... (sighs) I know it's hard to meet new people. I know because I'm in the same situation. Maybe we could talk over a nice dinner. Call me. You can reach me at elite escorts. (sighs) Hi, I'm Charlotte. I know it's hard to meet new people. And I know Because I'm in the exact same situation. So maybe we can talk about it over a nice dinner? Call me. You can reach me at select escorts. (gulls calling) Excuse me. Can I sit anywhere? We're a little ahead of the season, So take your pick. (door shuts) (grunts) Can I get you something? You doing double duty? We're new, and it's my place. So, yes. I'd like a cup of coffee, charlotte. That's not my name. What is your name? Amelia. Do you have a last name? Yes. Do you have a name? Jesse. And do you have a last name? Stone. Are you a cop, Jesse Stone? Do I look like a cop, Amelia? You look like a man who asks questions. Well, I have another question. It's a hypothetical. Suppose I were a cop and you were a Charlotte, You'd know I was here About Mavis Davies. That's not a question, Jesse Stone. The killings stopped. That seems to be enough for some people. But it is not justice for your friend If the killer is still out there. I am a cop. I'm good at what I do. There is no part of me that thinks this is over. Hope your business gets better, Amelia. I just wanted to say hi. You miss me? Like I would a bad cold. That's sweet. It's nice that we've become friends. You going home? I hate it there. You hate it there Because you have to be the grown-up. I talked to your mom. About me? About her. Yeah. My mom has issues. Your mom loves you. But you're gonna have to be the grown-up For a little while longer. I can do that. I know you can. I know you don't like me. I didn't say that. Can you trust me, Jenny? Can i ask you a question? You can. Would you tell your friends about my place? Could you do that? I could. Do you have some time? I don't open till 11:30, So yeah. Cops have problems with professional escorts. I never said that. I don't. Why'd you call me? I couldn't sleep last night. Something I said? Do you really think that somebody else killed her? I do. How do you know? I don't know, I think. Do you think that I know? I do not. But you know things that I don't know. Was she still alive when he...? Yes. The things that must have been going through her head. Don't chase that. That's not Somewhere you should go, amelia. That's my job. Will you help me? Yes. Yes. Tell me about Mavis. She was my friend. She always had time for me. And in my... Former line of work, Friends are Irreplaceable. Did you know she was married? I did. After a hard day at the office, We would always have a drink and talk. After telling men what they want to hear, It's a way to decompress. Right before you lost your friend, What would you talk about? We would tell each other about our lives, Our... You know, our private lives, But at a certain point, She would always just cut it off. Like, there was things that she just wanted to hold private. She said that she was... Going to get a divorce. She had been seeing someone. And she was in love, Which is a common ambition in our profession. - Not a client? - No. No, Mavis was Way too smart for that. She did tell me that he was married, He had kids, And that he needed time. Could I talk to him? I don't know him. That's where she would always cut it off. All I know is that he was a-a cop And that he was trying to find a way That it wouldn't hurt his career. Maybe you can just tell me the why of that. He got her a puppy. She never let it out of her sight. A red setter mix named Steve. How'd you know? I just know. You satisfied yet? Not hardly, sydney. They locate the stolen car That pushed me off the road? They have not. How's detective Leary doing with this? He's pretty consumed with it. I brief him every day. Every day. You close? Not particularly. He's good at what he does. I mean, he did break the boston ripper case. - Well, Richard steele confessed. Healy brought him over from vice. I know. Why do you know? What's a good homicide detective Doing working vice? Paying penance. Apparently he had issues. What issues? I know you, Jesse. There's more behind this Than "how's he doing?" Humor me. What issues? Apparently he couldn't keep it in his pants. His wife, a real piece of work, by the way, blew the whistle On him. She's prominent in the community, Comes from a lot of money, She goes right to the supervisor of detectives. Why do you know his history? Mavis davies had an arrest for prostitution, But no charges were filed. It was when Leary was working vice. - So? - So, if I could Connect Mavis to Leary, it means He knew her well before she was murdered. This isn't tracking. Oh, yeah, it is, Because if he did know her, he certainly never told anybody. Did he arrest her? Her file shows the arrest But not the arresting officer. I think it's been scrubbed. You getting enough sleep? I never get enough sleep. Probably also scrubbed from NCIC. Check NLETS. NLETS? National law enforcement and teletype service. I don't have a teletype. A lot of cops don't know it still exists. I think they changed it to "telecommunications." I prefer "teletype." You are a dinosaur. Can't scrub something If you don't know it exists. My guess is, mavis' missing Toxicology report came back clean. Why does that matter? It matters to Richard Steele. Stay right where you are. Mavis Davies. Arrested in february of last year. No charges filed. Arresting officer... Detective Daniel Steven Leary. I checked the booking blotter At the precinct where leary worked vice. The page was torn out. No charges were filed. He let her go. I think he fancied her. All we know is he knew her. Daniel Steven Leary. He gave her a puppy. She named him Steve. Okay, then let's just throw him in prison. Sydney, she was in love with the guy. I think she was becoming a problem for him. I want you to lock him out. You want me to lock him out. Yes. As of now, I will work on who pushed me off the road. (sighs) Look, he knew Mavis And went to great lengths to hide it even after She was murdered. And he knew the specific m.O. Of the killer. I'm just saying. It would take a cold bastard to do to Mavis What was done to the other three. Premeditated murder's cold bastard work. Morning, suit. Morning, Jesse. Thank you. Donut? They're coply. My body's a temple. How are your classes going? Classes? Oh, my classes. Very well. Very fulfilling. You're working on something in Boston. I feel it in my cells. I kind of am. In between classes. Why do you do that? Do what? You withhold. Why? I'm not sure. I talked to Jenny's mom. Thank you. And? I think Dr. Dix put a dent in her denial. She wants to go to rehab. That's a good thing. Says she can't afford it. She's on scholarship. Can you afford it? (sighs) I'll have to. She doesn't know what to do about Jenny. Just love her. They might put her in a foster home. (sighs) they could. She's worried. It's about time. Well, time for me to lie in wait. Speed trap? For the greater good. I hate these things. (beep) (sighs) Amelia (recorded): Hello, Jesse Stone. I got your text. I can meet you before work, but I can't be there at 10:00. I got to pick up supplies. 10:15 okay? I don't text. (beep) (tires screeching) (sighs) (beep) (recorded): It's Jesse. Don't go to that meeting. Stay away from there. You're in danger. Man: Amelia? - Yes. It's nice to put a face to the name. Jesse's talked a lot about you. I'm detective Dan Leary, State homicide. Jesse's been detained, And we had a break in Mavis davies' murder. He asked me to take you to him. Oh, I'm sorry. I have to open up the caf. It's police business, please. I'll just let my assistant know. Please. Okay. (grunts) (grunts) (grunting) Stop! (whimpers) (clicking) (sniffles) (whimpers) I'll kill her! To what end? You're done. You kill us both, you're still done. (sirens wailing in distance) Step away. (shouts) (handcuffs clicking) You son of a bitch! (panting) (sirens chirping) (indistinct police transmission) Some cases are hard, some are easy. This one was easy. He made it easy. Did you have a choice? No. That's one cold bastard. (sighs) you okay? Oh, you know me, Sydney. Yes, I do, Jesse. I'm gonna need a new car. That would make three. How's she doing? Jesse: She's tough. Wasn't about to become a victim. - It's sad. - What's sad? Richard Steele will feel vindicated. I could care less. He ought to be dead. (indistinct police transmission) What are you thinking about? Mavis. Where'd you learn that move? My dad. He made me take self-defense classes. Fathers are important. Happens to cops a lot. They control themselves, do what they have to do. Afterwards, they become part of the debris. See what I mean? Steve's my new roommate. What? Mavis' dog. Oh. Maybe you'd like to come see him sometime. I'd like that. (sighs) Thank you. For what? Getting justice for my friend. I know you must have a last name. Hope. Amelia hope. That's a nice name.
