We're not in the jungle anymore. Just gonna trade one jungle for another, Simon. Well, this place has a little hot lady That actually thinks you're a pretty big deal. Where'd she get that idea? Well, hell, man, I told her last time we were here. Thank you. What are you doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm coming. You're not invited, Especially in that pink thing. Hey, man, this is rustic salmon. My mama gave me this. I told you, You're going to mess me up. Look, what you need is a witness. What I need is to do this by myself. I'm coming, man. In Ulu Tiram today, our reporter, Matt Ellman, And his cameraman, Simon Porter, Had a close call while filing a report From a rebel encampment. After a few tense moments, The rebel leader agreed to talk. Oh, he is so cute! Lucky girl... Dan! Dan! Come on over here! Look, it's Jessie's man. He's not my man, Deborah. Honestly, we've known each other For barely two months. Two months? Oh, you can get into a lot of trouble In two months, can't we, Hal? It's on the house, Antonio. Thanks. Here's a toast from tony and I. To Jessie Machalan, The best tour guide In all of southeast Asia. Well, thank you. Asia? Hell, the world! May she find true love Before I turn straight and marry her myself. Despite efforts at brokering a peace, The killing goes on. Three long years in the jungle, And these men show no signs of backing down... Hey, wait up! Matt Ellman, reporting to you from Ulu Tiram. He's lying. I don't think Matt's capable of that. He's lying! He's not in ulu tiram. And what makes you say that? Because I'm right here. Baby! This is Matt, everybody. Hi! Hi, Matt. Hi, everybody. God, you smell good. I missed you. I missed you, too. I hate it when you go off on assignment like that And disappear. It's what I do, But if anybody could talk me out of it, It would be you. Excuse me, Your champagne. Congratulations! Hey, thanks, But what's the occasion? You know, I'll let, Matt take care of that. No, stay, have a few beer. You know, I'd love to, But, I got to call my mom. Yeah, you see, when I win this lottery, I'm gonna buy her a brand-new house. You're a good man. Really, Jessie? Because I find that people find me... Good night, buddy. Yeah, good night, and... Make sure my boy has a good night. Sir, jewelllery, jewellery... Oh, yeah! Come on, sir. Wait here. You're not going to run off to the mountains again, are you? Not in this lifetime. Excuse me... Jessie... Jess... Jessie? Jess? Jess... Matthew Ellman, We have found you. Jessie... Jess? Jessie! What the hell is this place? Please, please, please, please... Please, please... Jessie, is that you? Matthew? Oh, thank God! I thought I was completely alone. I'm sorry, but... Do I know you? It's me. Deborah. Deborah glass, from Jessie's tour. Deborah? Yeah. But you're... Dead? Come. Over here. Oh, my God... Is that a face you remember? Not for a very long time. Matt... What happened to us? There was a bomb. This girl in the club, She just... She blew herself up. Oh, God, no... Daniel? Oh, Daniel! Daniel! Daniel, is that you? Daniel! Sweetie! Daniel! Honey! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I thought I'd lost you. I thought you were gone. Oh, no... Look at you. You're the girl I married. Deborah? Is that Deborah? Hal, is that you? - Daniel? - Hal? What's going on? Hey, where's Antonio? Shouldn't tony be here, too? Matt! Wait a minute, why haven't... Why haven't you changed? What the hell is going on? Where's Jessie? I don't know, But right now, the thing we have to do is Act like this is real, This is happening. Antonio and Jessie must be here somewhere. Let's stay together, see if we can find them. Yeah, but you don't have to do this. You know, we're not your problem. We all know Jessie. She's cute, but stubborn. If you're missing, she'll try and find you. Why don't you guys stay here, Make a fire, get warm. Okay. I'll see if I can find something to eat. Hey, Bernie... Hey, Bernie! You know that guy? I'm not sure. He looked like one of the junior partners From our new york office. Worked on the 82nd floor, North tower. Hey, Matt, wait up! It's just me. No bracelet? I had one. I remember waking up. I was floating in water. This woman in robes flew over me And cut the bracelet from my wrist. Man, how friggin' nuts is that? I saw all of us... Just before I blacked out. You were all dead. Antonio? I'm sorry. No, no, that's a good thing. That means tony has to be here, too, And Jessie. And I detest All of my sins, lord. And I detest all of my sins, lord... What is this? Some kind of scanner? One way to find out. Hey, Matt, Let me try it. Meatloaf? Okay, they got me there. That's weird. I was just thinking about how hungry I was. Mm, that's mom's meatloaf. Excuse me, please? May I share your fire? Oh, yes. Yeah, of course. I have gathered some seaweed. It may provide some nourishment. Anything'll do. We're starved. Can you tell me, Am I dead? That seems to be the question of the day. But that is not an answer. Only because I don't have one. Finally, An honest man. Your clothes, Your robe... You're a Bhikkhuni, A buddhist nun. Where do you come from? I am from nippon, near kyoto. I was born in the fourth year Of the reign of emperor go-reizei. You lived during the gempei wars? That was I'm sorry, I was... Am a history professor. This is amazing. You're from medieval japan, But you speak english? I have not heard of this... English... Before today. It is like I learned it in a dream. That makes as much sense As anything does in this place. English is the most widespread language In history. If I wanted everybody to understand each other, I'd rewire their brains to install english. But you didn't, Which begs the question... Who did? Are you okay? Jessica! Jessie! Jessica... I know you. You were there, in the river. No, you're mistaken. No. Remembering faces is my job. You were there, my friend. I said you were mistaken, And you've hardly earned the right to call me "friend." Just now, you called a woman's name. Who were you looking for? Was it Jessie? Jessie Machalan? How do you know Jessie? My arm, sir. Jessie Machalan. Tell me how you know her! My advice, sir, as a gentleman, Is forget Jessie Machalan. Forget you ever met her. Fast, fast! They will be here! Who? Hey! Who? Who will be here? My money. I thought you said this was going to be safe. My money... No. No money until you show us. Let's set up. I can't shoot this, man. My money... Let's set up. What... What are you doing? I'm sorry, Matthew Ellman. You saw? Who the hell are you? I was watching you. The man who beat you, do not judge him. Maybe you didn't hear me. I said who the hell are you? His name is Richard Burton. Those in power will try to use you against him. Do not listen to them. Okay, you know what? I'm just going to go find some cold water And dip my head in it, And start this day all over, All right, Obi-Wan? You're that thing I saw in the cave, When I was wearing the wrist band, When I was basically dead. I'm your caretaker, Matthew. I am here to watch you. He said he was watching me. Listen to me. He is a salvationist, a traitor. They have corrupted many here in Riverworld, Including this man, Burton. I'm sorry, but you guys can fight your own war. I've got someone I need to find. If you wish to find Jessica... Then you must first stop Burton, Even if it means killing him. No... You can't do that! You are hurt. Did you see that thing? I saw nothing. I heard you talking. I was looking for you. I'm not even sure it was human. You saw an oni? A demon? Oni, alien, bart simpson, I have no idea. I've got to get some answers from someone. You need to rest. You are fortunate to be alive. Yeah, if we are alive. Does your head hurt? It's killing me. If you can feel pain, then you're alive, And if you're alive, Then perhaps we all are. Oh, feels good! We lost one of our own tonight. We must be cautious. There are second chances everywhere. You were unwise to provoke Mr. Ellman so soon. Why? He has been chosen. He's not wearing a band. He's looking for the girl. Everything puts him in opposition to me. I say get rid of him, Sooner rather than later. Not while he's being observed... And protected, And he's not yet had time to make a judgement. Perhaps he will come around to your way. Not with the girl between us. Then let him lead you back to her, And perhaps the tower. And when you have it within your sights, Do what you must. How many times? How many times have you ridden the suicide express, huh? Me? Four! Four times I've killed myself. That, comrades, is courage. That, comrades, is stupidity. Because one time you won't come back, And no one knows when that time may be. Never do anything For which the outcome is uncertain. Now, wait for me here. Tomorrow, we meet our friend, And, God-willing, we'll begin our journey. So, what was his name? A woman like you Doesn't just suddenly decide to become a nun. Yoshinaka, A samurai. He was a great man, But also an ambitious man, And to achieve his ambitions, He waged a war. Many people died. He died. He was my greatest mistake. What was yours? There was more than just one. "the road we walk Was built with the stones that scar our feet." Who said that? Buddha? A nun from near kyoto, In the years after the gempei wars. I was a... A television reporter During our times of war. I had a buddy, A cameraman. We used a machine to take pictures of places, People who had been hurt by others. I'm not explaining myself very well. You painted portraits and told true stories. Yeah, most of the time, And you got it right, you were a hero. Wrong... To live an honorable life, One must risk everything, Always. Tomoe... This samurai of yours, If he had to kill a man, a stranger, to save you, Would he have done it? Without hesitation. I need to find this man, Burton, The one who attacked me. To kill him. You... You, get over here! Matthew! You killed us! You killed all of us! Stop! You're hurting her! I'm sorry... I'm sorry! I survived Afghanistan, Chechnya, Darfur, And this coward kills me And the only woman I ever truly loved! I'm sorry! I'm sorry... They told me you were devils, Unclean, That by killing you I would free our people, That I'd be rewarded in paradise. But there is no paradise, Only this place, This land of infidels. So, because you didn't get your reward, You're suddenly sorry for what you did? If they lied about paradise, what else did they lie about? How is a person supposed to live When everything is a lie? Soldiers! Who the hell are these guys? Conquistadors. That's a spanish flag. All right, honey, you stay here. No! No, no, no, I'll handle these clowns. Hey! Hey, you! Daniel... Hey, what are you doing? You guys can't just waltz in here. That's enough. Hey, hey, hey, who are you guys? Huh? What's going on? You will not address El Adelantado Without permission, peasant. Okay, shorty, listen, I'm an american attorney, And I'll address whoever I damn well please, Including the, man of La Mancha here. Nice outfit... No, you will be slaughtered! Silencio. Daniel! No! No! You will all bow down To your new lord and master! May I present the governor-general of Peru, Conqueror of the incas, Francisco Pizarro. Pizarro? Heed the words of El Adelantado! Poor ignorant bastards. You have no idea where you are, Or what is happening to you. I will make everything simple, huh? Clear. This world, This Riverworld, Is a purgatory, Constructed by demons, And overrun by pagans and idolaters, Not so different From the depraved savages Of the americas Before we spaniards brought them to heel. What this world needs Is vision. It needs order. I have that vision, And I will provide that order, And you, All of you, Will help me in this divine mission, Or... I will make you suffer Until you beg for death. Matthew... Your wound, it is healed. Things must heal quickly here. Show your grailband, And remember, one third of your food is ours. Anyone taking alcohol or drugs from the stone Will be punished. Well, this just keeps getting better. I'm almost glad Antonio's not here... Almost. We have to get away. Too many soldiers. We must be patient, Wait for an opportunity. Oh, hey, your grailband. Why don't you get lost? We'll scrape up enough to feed you. You, come with me! This way, move! Where are you taking me? What did I do wrong? Antonio? Oh, my God! You're alive. Thank God! There's too much to explain right now. We have to be very careful. Just know That I'm going to find a way to get us out of here, okay? Okay? Do you get to keep the uniform? I've been looking for you. I'd almost given up hope. A year and a half? How is that possible? Welcome to Riverworld. I hope you like mac and cheese. Are you kidding? Comfort food. Thanks. Work harder! Antonio... How many people did you see in your travels? Thousands. I think people from all across time Are constantly being resurrected On these riverbanks. But why? Why? Beats me. But there has to be some logic, Some connection, Or none of us would have found each other. Look, the only thing I know is We've got to find a way to get out of here. You, beat it! Some kind of ship's coming upriver. Pizarro's been chasing it for years. He's going to ambush it from this fort. This is good. When the fighting starts, we can run. There will be much chaos and confusion. In the meantime, We've got to do whatever we can To screw this guy. That means we work slow, we make mistakes, We sabotage weapons... That one. Arrest him. You heard the man. Please, sit down. I'm fine standing. Sitting's good. Show me your wrist. Peramo. Unbound, huh? Like me. You don't look like a soldier, but... I am told you have been through many battles. I was a war zone reporter. That's a man who... I know what a reporter is, huh? All the time crying to the world about the weak. But there have always been weak, huh? And strong. Which are you, senor Ellman? Which should I be? If I'm weak, you'll take advantage. If I'm strong, I'm a threat, And you might have me killed. Very clever. You're american, si? I have seen far too many americans Since I have arrived here, huh? Oh, so noble in their hearts, But they have no concept of glory, Only an overweening selfishness. They want everyone to be just like them. They are children. They are not men. This may surprise you, But history didn't treat you kindly. Are we through? Please, please. Be patient, huh? You're my guest. You see, I'm curious, senor Ellman, Where is it that you think that you are going? Have you a plan, A destination in mind? Or are you looking for something? Or someone? Did Burton tell you that? Ah, you know my new friend. Burton doesn't strike me As the kind of man who makes friends. No. No, but we are brothers, of a sort, Burton and I, huh? The question is, Whose brother are you? I don't know what you mean. You're unbound. No grailband, huh? But you must have been helped somewhere along the way, huh? Was it a... Was it a man or a woman? Look, I woke up here yesterday. I don't know anything about sides. I could end you, senor Ellman, Like I have ended so many others... Emperors, noblemen. Your blood would be little more Than an insignificant drop In a vast red sea. You can kill me, but I'll come back, won't I? Just like you and everyone else here. I haven't seen anyone really old. Do you just kill yourself and start again? Is that the secret? There are endless secrets Within secrets, None of which You have earned the right to know, hmm? Best I keep an eye on you. Put him in irons. Where did they take Matt? I'll find Matt. Just keep doing your dirty work, but don't get caught. Work harder or starve! Bernardo, come! I have to show you something. Thank you. Thank you very much. Haven't had a nice meal of knuckles and dirt Since my last birthday, You son of a bitches. Our first category is "three strikes." For 200 dollars, "these three outings Should never have been undertaken." What is the titanic, The hindenberg, And Matt Ellman's new year's eve party On the staten island ferry! Come here. Look at you! It's good to see you, man. Last glimpse I had of you, You were lying in your coffin. Sorry, man. I'm sorry for staring at you. I just can't believe it's you. Matt Ellman is in the house! What are you doing here? Oh, that's a sorry, sorry story. I had four numbers When this thing went down. I never got to see a fifth. What went down? The world, I think. What are you talking about? I was monitoring my police scanner, And there was lots of chatter. They scrambled f-16s, man. It was bad juju, really bad. You're serious? Yeah. Nasa was monitoring some ufo, And then it vaporized the entire earth. When? Six years after you died. You died six years after singapore? So, you've just been wandering this whole time? Yeah. Simon... Have you seen her? Jessie... I heard she was upriver Running from this guy named Burton. Look, I tried to find her, man, But I kept on running into this dude and his men, And they killed me. I'm not talking about a bunch of clowns Who slayed me with their humour. I'm sorry. You've died again, here? Twice. So we do keep coming back... Yeah, but I don't recommend it. Dude, I'm so glad you're here. You too, buddy. Yeah. Damn. Another accident? Flooded ditches, cracked oil drums, Loose support beams. It's astonishing how many things have gone wrong With this little project. What do you want? A stroll along the thames, And a maxim gun with a few thousand rounds, And a night with a hindi girl Well-versed in the Kama Sutra. Unfortunately, I have to make do with you And the rest of your sorry lot. I know you think you're being very clever With this sabotage of yours, But the problem is That each misstep you make is going to be taken Out of your dear Mr. Ellman's flesh, And, yes, you will be there to watch. Take him away, And bring me Mr. Ellman. Senor Ellman, Have you ever heard of diego de almagro? Diego and I were brothers-in-arms, huh? Amigos. Together, we conquered the inca empire, Laid low atahualpa, and shook the word. But when the king made me Emperor of Peru, Diego, he became jealous, huh? And he betrayed me. Should I be taking notes? Cause if there's going to be a quiz... I thought perhaps His fate will be illustrative. I rebuilt my army, Freed my brothers, Laid siege to his city, And defeated the cur in battle, And diego... He begged for his miserable life. He cried like a woman As I slowly strangled him to death. Well, there'll be no crying here, my friend. Burn him alive. El Adelantado, a word. Don't kill him, not yet. Why not? What will happen? You tell me now, Burton, Or I throw you on the pyre with him! He has no grailband. Draw your own conclusion. You think I have friends with the caretakers... What does he know of this? Probably nothing, But I suggest we keep him alive Till we know. Senor Ellman... Please forgive me, huh? I am but a... Barbarian. Bernardo, show our friend to our finest... Accommodations. I can't shoot this, man. My money... Let's set up. Simon, let's go. Let's get this done. No, you leave now. Men coming. This is what we came for. You got your money. The guy said let's go, so let's go. He's lying, okay? Do you see anything? Let's do this. This is Matt Ellman. I'm standing in front of a mass grave Here in the mountains of chechnya... Simon! Simon... Simon... Simon? Simon! Simon, get up! Get up, man! Come on, buddy. I got you. I got you... Okay... No! Eat, eat! Eat! Bastardo. Tomoe, what are you doing? Matthew's still alive, barely. We've got to get him out of here. It's difficult. He's under constant guard. Woman, here! A share goes to us! You, get us some more food, now! I got you. I got you... I'm sorry, I'm sorry... It was an accident... You can't keep beating yourself up over it Your entire life. I'm sorry. I'm coming, baby. You. Where's Jessie? She's still waiting for you, Matt. She needs you. Get to the river and find Sam. He'll help you, but you must find Sam. Sam. What do you know about Sam? What do you know about Sam? What do you know about Sam? Run! Run free! No! No! Risoner escaped! Prisoner e escaped! Sword. Get out of my way! Fire! Fall back! Stop! No grailband. Are you Sam? Launch ahead. Dead slow. Linesmen to starboard. Youseff, how many times do we have to tell you, No strays. Hold up your wrist. No grailband. Like me. Are you "Sam?" I'm Matt Ellman. A caretaker told me to find you. Male or female? A woman, While I was in Pizarro's camp. Pizarro. So he is waiting for us. We ambushed some conquistadors upstream. They were chasing him. They say the enemy of my enemy Is my friend. Are you my friend, Mr. Ellman? Maybe, Once I get to know you. My apologies. I have been remiss in my introductions. Well, you've met our chief of marines, Youseff mbaye. Mademoiselle fabarge, My chief engineer, And this lovely creature, This is Allegra Braccioforte... My diplomatic liaison. And I am the owner and operator of this fabulous riverboat, The not-for-hire. Captain Samuel Clemens, at your service. Samuel Clemens? As in Mark Twain? Guilty as charged. Impressive. You don't look impressed. Frankly, you remind me of a dyspeptic cat, Like you swallowed somethin', And you're about to cough it back up. I think, meeting you, it's made it all hit home... Mark Twain giving me a tour of his riverboat. This place... It's not just a dream, is it? We really are dead. Dead and reborn. I woke up here five years ago. If I am dead, Then this is the longest dream ever. Millions, Or perhaps billions of people From every epoch of human history, Reborn along the banks of a seemingly endless river. Basic needs all provided for... But no children... No old people... No civilization. The question, Mr. Ellman, is, why? What is the point of it all? Is it a chance to atone? For what we screwed up in life? Life is a considerable test. Having endured its random cruelties For 75 years, I see no reason for a make-up exam. Do you have a better explanation? Nope. But I do intend to find one. That's why I built the not-for-hire In the first place. You didn't build it. You stole it! I earned this ship. I found the raw materials, The engineers, Convinced Pizarro to provide the labour. Yeah, by telling him he could use it To conquer the world. That was a good trick, huh? The ship and the girl all at once. "the girl?" Allegra. She used to be Pizarro's woman, Until Sam... Won her heart. Pizarro was not happy. The man takes his grudges very seriously. So, why are we on this journey? Every river has its source. I'm convinced That, at the source of this particular river, We shall find its creators, And, hence, those responsible for our new existence. So, you're going to go to the "source," Find the gods, or God, Or little green men that made this place, And force them to give you an explanation? That's the plan. And, you, my friend, you're gonna make it possible. They've spotted the ship! It's coming upriver! It won't be long now. El Adelantado, they are 10 miles out, Moving dead slow in deep water. Does he think he can just steam past? Well, let's hope he tries. He can't get by Without coming in range of our weapons. You're surprisingly self-confident For a man who was just defeated By an aboriginal army And a man on foot. It wasn't my men who turned and ran like little girls, I can assure you of that. That's the channel where Youseff saved my butt. It had a strong current, So it probably joins back up to the main river Somewhere here... Above the fort. Well, it's a riverboat... Only draws three feet. Just might work. So now, if I do this, How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain And help me find Jessie? You don't. It's a quandary, I know, But... Look at this face. Would this face lie to you? In a heartbeat. It's true... I am a habitual mendicant, But I pay my debts, Not because I'm honest, But because I dislike intensely being obliged to another man. So, if you give me your assistance You will have my help in return, Measure for measure. And the others? The ones back in Pizarro's camp? What about them? I'm afraid they will have to look out for themselves. It strikes me, Burton, That trusting you could be a serious error. That so? How can I be certain That you're not an agent of the enemy? Certainty is a luxury, my friend, Along with clarity, faith, sanity... All those other foolish notions We clung to in our previous existence. Do not tempt fate, my friend... Look out! You are a mad woman. Why do you throw your life away? You killed her husband the day you rode in. Ah, si, si... I'd forgotten. It was of such little significance. Burn her at the stake. No! Youseff? When you were alive, you were a soldier, right? I was a taxi driver. In Dakar. My brother was the soldier. He was a sergeant in the tirailleurs senegalais, But I had a family, so I stayed home. Then what's with the hat? Allah gave me a second life. What is the point living it the same way I did my first? So I am a soldier... Now, And I've been one for six years. Why? Tell me, Does Sam's plan have a chance in hell of working? Insha'Allah... It is in the hands of Allah, Or whatever he is called in this place. Three years to build this boat... Another two years of runnin'... It all comes down to this. It's not good to worry so much. The rich and powerful of venice Must've lined the grand canal outside your door. Too bourgeois. I had an apprentice arrange it So my lovers never saw each other. Each could delude himself Into believing I was his... And his alone. I suffer no such delusions, my dear. I'm content to be among the unwashed multitudes. I was thinking... Perhaps I should get closer To our new friend, senor Ellman. Take a peek, See if he has something to hide. Are you trying to make me jealous? Are you trying to pretend It's not working? Let us endeavor to get past the spaniard first. And then we can discuss your machiavellian designs On young Mr. Ellman. Machiavelli... Now, there was a man who knew how to treat a lady. Incorrigible. Matthew? Matthew. Matthew... Matt... Matthew! Matthew. What do you want? Burton is still alive. You have to stop him. I'm not good at taking orders, never have been. Kill Burton. It is the only way To save Jessica. Look. You want me to kill someone? I'm going to need A little more information. Great. Really helpful. What is that? That... Is none of your damn business. The engine room was locked, But there he was, nosing around. You have to forgive poor amelie. She doesn't like strange noses In her private places. Excuse me, but I don't open my door To every man who's willing to pay the price. Ladies! Ladies. Now, back to the subject at hand. Yeah. Like what's that thing powering your ship? It was a gift... From one of our protectors. The woman caretaker? Yes. She bequeathed it to me In exchange for some... As-of-yet unnamed future favour. Helping you, perhaps? As to what it is? Mademoiselle fabarge has her theories. It might be a fusion reactor, Fueled by the hydrogen in the water. That thing is nuclear? You see now why it's important That this ship not fall into the wrong hands? How do we know this one isn't the wrong hands? Why are we trusting him? We are in position. Time to get to work. As to whether or not we can trust you, Mr. Ellman, I suppose we shall see... Directly. Help me! Somebody, help! They're going to burn her at the stake! It is time. Time for what? Time to be brave. Don't you think we need a little help? All the slaves enjoy complaining, But none will risk their lives. There's a friend of Matt's... In prison, his name's Simon. Then bring him. The spaniard's lust for death must be answered. Sounding. Half Twain. Six feet? I've stepped in deeper puddles. The grailstone... That's where I was held in the cage. Somebody, help me! No! No! No! Something interests you, english? Thinhe t fox has outfoxed the hounds. Clemens... On my ship! He's in behind us. Conquistadors! Reposition the catapults! Now! Now! We're under attack! We're under attack! Go! Go! Go! Go! We're under attack! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Watch out, watch out, watch out! Damn! That was cool. Where's Matt? Matthew's gone. El hefe's about to roast Deborah, And three of us are going to take on Pizarro's army. Sound fun? No, that doesn't sound like fun. Come on! Oh, geez! Come back here, you cowards! Come! To the front! Please, release our friend now. Prepare your soul. I am Tomoe Gozen, Swordswoman of the minamoto clan, Champion, consort, And war captain to Kiso Yoshinaka. I bow to no man. Please, release our friend now. Kill her. Kill them all. Stop, stop, stop, stop. We have to keep moving. Matthew, you cannot help. We have to get past the fort. I got to borrow this. Matthew! Let's go! But we're not fighting? Not his battles. Three-quarters Twain. It's getting deeper, and we're past the camp. Start the engines. Get us out of here. Not yet. We have an agreement With Mr. Ellman. You really meant all that? I thought you had sense. Sometimes, I don't know why I tolerate you. Well, we know it's not for my cooking. Burton, get your men! Burton! Never trust a man who eats blood pudding. Santiago y cierra! Conquistadores! Vamos! I'm a college professor. What am I doing here? Oh... Antonio! Look out! Antonio! No! Get him out of here! You never told me you were a samurai. A samurai does not talk, a samurai fights. Conquistadores! Deborah! Encore! Mr. Youseff! Vite! Vite! Wait, wait! Go! Go! Youseff. You guys seen Deborah? You guys seen Deborah? You know, I think we did it. I think we did it. Hey, guys. Bet you didn't think I was coming back. You're such a dumbass, You're not even smart enough to save yourself. As many times as I've seen this, I never get used to it. We're not supposed to. Is that your friend? I hope so. I sure as hell don't want her as an enemy. Behind you! I am nothat easy to. Sure ya are. Clemens... Hello, Francisco. Coward. In the back? I find, if you must shoot a dangerous animal, It's best to do it by surprise And from a considerable distance. Strange... Thought I would enjoy that. You don't see this every day. Burton escaped. Gee, sorry... I was a little busy trying not to get stabbed. As long as Burton lives, none of you are safe. The others don't see you. This is a dream. A message. Delivered to the wrong person. I'm not a killer. Why are you here, Matthew Ellman? Have you asked yourself that question? I'm still trying to figure out what "here" is. When this Riverworld was created, We believed it could be a place For your people to be reborn, A place for atonement, A second chance to achieve perfection. But there are a few among us Who believe we have failed, That you are not worthy, And so this world must be destroyed. You said "created." By who? We cannot act directly on your behalf. Our laws forbid it. But some have seen fit To ignore our laws And interfere... To choose champions among the awakened, People who they can use To serve their own ends. Burton is the champion of the salvationists, A tool they intend to use to destroy the Riverworld. And I'm your champion? Yes. You... Sam... Jessica. Jessica? Jessica is... Our hope, But she is in great danger. Stop Burton. For you... For Jessica... For all of us. Hey... You'll be okay. Just, maybe cut back on the swashbuckling a bit? I'll trade the swash for the swish. Sorry... I couldn't resist. It means you're feeling better. I'm going to go check on the others, But I'll be back soon, okay? I'm not going anywhere. All right, gentlemen... and lady... Let's fire this old gal up, see where she'll take us. That... Is an excellent idea. Who the hell are you? Burton. His name is Burton. I don't believe we've been introduced. Captain sir Richard Francis Burton. My friends call me "dick". Burton, the explorer? Yeah, I read one of your books. It was amateurish, unnecessarily crude, And pathetically self-congratulatory. Clemens, I'm confused. Are you talking about my work or yours? You again. You want to deal with me, fine, But, first, let him go. He has no part in this. Why, certainly. You see, Mr. Ellman, I can be quite reasonable. Now, Mr. Clemens, if you'll set down your weapon We can discuss the terms of your surrender. "Surrender" is not in my vast vocabulary. How about "bollocks"? Is that in your vast vocabulary? Bollocks? Ah! Son of a bitch! Not... A good idea. You, sir... Are a most despicable example Of humankind. Why, thank you. Mr. Ellman... I'm disappointed. I saved your life once. Where's the gratitude? I'll send flowers. Roses, I find, work for any occasion, Although now I've secured this ship, Keeping you alive doesn't have the same urgency That it once did. Jessie... Jessie? Jessie... Jess... Jessie? "Jessie." Yes, thank you for reminding me. She... Gave me a message to give to you. Now, what was it? You bastard. No, that wasn't it. Now I remember. She said to tell you She was in love with another man, And to give you this... Matt! Matthew! Sweep the ship for survivors! Prepare to cast off. Come on! This way. Salut. I'm amelie. Antonio. Call me tony. Thanks for helping me out back there. Show me. Lovely. Quite lovely. And you thought I never graduated from soviet naval academy. It should put on quite a show. Sorry, Sam. Matthew! It was an accident... It was an accident... Okay? Okay? You can't keep beating yourself up over it Your entire life. Yeah, that's what everyone says... What everyone says... What everyone says... People need to see the truth. People need to see the truth. "forget it. Put it behind you." "put it behind you." You owe it to that little girl to keep showing it to them... Otherwise you're wasting two lives... Otherwise you're wasting two lives. How come you know all the answers? You know all the answers? I'd better not lose you. To the end of the world. Found this one hiding In the captain's quarters. I was hardly hiding. I was doing my hair. She had the door locked. It is my room. I'm afraid that's no longer true. I wouldn't be so hasty. Sam's quarters are drafty. You might want a little extra warmth. Signorina Allegra Bracchioforte de Venezia At your service. Charmed. Is she the last one? I smelled a few rats Crawling around in the bilge, But we'll get them. Throw her overboard. Wait, wait! One of your rats, Amelie, our engineer, She's quite loyal to Sam. A little infatuated, actually. She knows every inch of this ship. I might be able to help you smoke her out. So, why are you telling me this? Guess. I think you like power. I think whoever controls the boat Has power, And if it's not going to be you, Then there are... Other ways to exert control. I am transparent to you, Unable to hide my motivations, Which is a good basis for a partnership, no? Besides, you need me. I was Sam's confidante, Privy to all his plans to find the source. I don't care about Clemens' idiotic quest. I have an agenda of my own. Really? Does it involve adventure? If you call armageddon a lark. I'm going to wage war on the gods, Shake the heavens, And bring this entire farce to a conclusion. Now, if you wish to participate, You'd best prove as useful as you say, Because I'm not good with disappointment. Nothing. No footprints on the other side? I don't know about Hal, But Matt would have fought like hell. Even if he couldn't swim to shore, I mean... He just would have floated downriver. No. He was shot two times. I couldn't save him today. I couldn't even do that. I just... I just watched my friend go down in the water. There is but one path we can choose. We are never going to catch them. We are never going to catch them By following the river. We're tortoises, And that hare ain't getting any slower. You all right, Mr. Porter? Not really. No sign of Hal, and... Matt's gone. I can't believe those words are coming out of my mouth. Well, are you certain? Yeah. What about Tomoe? Is she certain? She says the only way to find them Is to join 'em, And I don't know. I've already been around here twice. I just can't do it again. Everyone must heed their calling in this life, Especially here. Her decision is no more or less valid than yours. We will see them all again, Rest assured. The only real enemy in this life is despair, my friend. I know that. I've been there myself. I lost my wife, My daughters, And I woke up here alone. I found one infallible solution. Hey, maybe this is not the time... I am pontificating. Anger. That's the cure for what ails you. You get yourself good and riled up. That's what I did, Transformed myself into a mean-spirited, stubborn, Irascible hornet. Raged at the world! Anger is a distraction. Purpose. Purpose is a gift from allah. We're spending too much time winding back and forth. The nottie has to stick to the river. We sure as hell don't. Cross the mountains? Revenge, Our most comforting friend, Is waiting for us on that boat. I've been a poor husband. I wasted our lives on war And grasping for power. I ask for your forgiveness. They will remember you Long after I have been forgotten. Little girls will ride their ponies, Pretending to be Tomoe Gozen. I will find you. Welcome back, Mr. Ellman. Judging by your reaction, Your last few moments in the river Were not all that pleasant. Please keep that in mind as we proceed. What are you doing to me? Where am I? Jessie? It's okay, babe, I'm coming. I'm sorry, baby. That's why I was afraid to pull you into my life. I never wanted anything to happen to you. I saw a ring. A ring... Was it for me? Yeah. Then I'm happy. My answer is yes. No... No. No, Jess... Jessie... No, Jessie, wake... Jessie, wake up. Wake up, baby. Jess... No... Hmm, a good strong emotional memory. No! No, that's not the way it happened. Perhaps yes, Perhaps no. Who's to say? I was there. That is not the way it happened! I'm confused. You wish with all your being That that was the way it happened, yes? So, what's the difference? What the hell are you doing to me? What the hell are you doing to me? That's not the way it happened! That's not the way it... That's not... That's not the way it happened... That was... Vigorous. When I was a soldier in India, I came across a book called the Kama Sutra. It was... Quite educational. It won't work, by the by... Seducing me so that I will relax my guard, And you can find the opportune moment to strike. From one serpent to another. Yes, we are despicable creatures, aren't we? And yet I died of old age In my own bed, With my wife at my side. Oh? A moral lesson? Quite the opposite, really. My death was more... Poetic, Poisoned by a rival. Well, just so as you know, I never drink or eat anything That I haven't prepared myself. Very healthy of you. Show me that twisty one again. No, not now. Work to do. Worlds to end. You really intend to destroy this place? Watch and see. No! Well, I think that's quite enough Of that nonsense. So who exactly is it you're looking for? Am I that obvious? This world is home To thousands of villages And hundreds of thousands of people, Perhaps all of humanity at one point or another, And everyone is looking for someone. Including yourself? I may be the exception. I'm looking for a way out. Though you may be an argument to the contrary. You son of a bitch! Clearly, not an image you wish to cherish. It's not real. This, All those images in my head, It's just some sick game you're playing! None of it's real! Is it? Is this real? Define "real." Interesting. You have no grailband, You stopped Pizarro, You almost took the ship from Burton, And yet you expect me to believe That was all random chance? What did they ask of you? The second chancers? What did they ask you to do? I have no idea what you're talking about. I just want to find her! Jessie! The girl you showed me in my dreams. I just want to find the real Jessie. I just want to find the real Jessie. That's it. Perhaps that was the real Jessie, The one so vividly displayed, Or would you prefer to cling onto a burnished image From the past? You're so good at reading the bumps on my head, You tell me. Sadly, I suspect You would not be able to accept the truth. I have no reason to accept your truth. If you wish the discomfort to end, You will. You don't have the slightest clue who I... Am. You have a surprising appetite for abuse. It would seem you've come to the right place. Leave me alone. If I had to come back from the dead, Why not somewhere hot, man, like Jamaica? This is not Eyrie. You may want to conserve energy. We've got a long climb ahead of us. Look, man, I hate waiting, man. I always have. Not much on sleep, either, I'd say. Hey, sleep is for the rich. I prefer the casino. Good place to hang out all night, And it kinda keeps me out of the upper tax bracket. A man after my own heart. I too enjoy a good wager. It's another slaver camp. Same as every grailstone Between here and the river. Nine slavers, a dozen slaves. What is up with mankind and slavery? Each grailband only works once a day, So if you want to eat well... The strong will always prey on the weak. That is the sad nature of humanity. Hey, Sam, I've been meaning to ask you, What was it like in the civil war? Nothing civil about it. There is one more thing. I saw one of our friends down there... Hal. He's being held captive. So, if the professor made it, What about Matt? Then it's settled. We're taking the stone. Three to one odds, The element of surprise on our side. Could be worse. Allons enfants de la patrie... Le jour de gloire est arriv?... You enjoy fighting far too much. Yeah, it beats driving a taxi. All right, Mr. Porter. Here we go. Coming. Jessie... Jessie? She said to tell you She was in love with another man, And to give you this. Jessie! We are not your enemies, Mr. Ellman. Our salvationist cause seeks to free you and your kind From this eternal riverworld prison, But you are too pathologically stubborn, And your animosity for Mr. Burton Runs too deep for you to be useful. Can I... Can I go back to being dead now? Oh, I would have you killed, But that would only facilitate your eventual resurrection By your champions, Who are deluded enough to believe That this farce of an existence Is a second chance. They are pathetic dreamers and will soon be defeated. Enjoy your stay with us, Mr. Ellman, Which will be eternal, Unless your nemesis, Mr. Burton, Can bring this world to an end. If I were you, I would pray for his success. Tomoe Gozen... Go and find him. He needs your help. Hello? Is someone there? Can you hear me? Yes... Who are you? Please answer me. Jessie? Jessie, is that really you? Oh, God, Mattie! I can't believe you're here. Jessie, are you all right? How long have you been here? I think... Four years. Maybe more. I... I stopped counting. Four years? I looked for you. I hoped you were somewhere along the river, and... Shh, shh, shh, it's all right. I'm... I'm here, Jessie. I'm here now. What have they been doing to you? They're messing with me, playing mind games, Make me think things about you. Me? What have they been saying? That you were with some guy on the river, Crap like that To try and break me, But it's not working, So they try to drown me, But that's not working either. So they're basically screwed. God, Jessie, I've missed you. I just want to wrap you up And not let go. Mattie... I need to tell you. There was someone. Burton? You know him? Yeah. We've met here on the river. When I woke up on the riverworld, It was insane. Richard saved me. Yeah, I saw it. I saw it all. He set out to explore the riverworld, And I joined him, But it was hoping to find you, Hoping to find out why we were here. I'm sorry, mattie. It's okay, Jess. I can't imagine what you've been through. We're together now. Thank you. Right now we've got to figure out a way To get out of this asylum. Mattie! Mattie, they're coming! - Jessie! - No, please! Leave her alone! Help! No! No, Jessie! This is no pleasure cruise, Gentlemen! Nyet... We're just travelling upriver to end the world. Now, get back to work and find our hidden friends. We'll need that woman engineer before we reach the tower. Get up! You know, I hate to give idiots of that magnitude credit, But they're going to find us sooner or later. I should have disabled the engines When I had the chance. Oni. You... Told me to find him and to help him. Who? He will come. You are prepared to fight. Good. Oh, my God! Oh, thank you. No problem, my friend. Antonio? Last time I saw Antonio was on Sam's boat, But listen, how'd you get here? I'm not really sure. I-I remember going underwater. I woke up on the river Somewhere not far from here. I never thought I'd see any of you again. You're safe... How do you do it, huh? Just fht like that And sit there like it doesn't even touch you? We were fighting the good fight. There is no institution in human history I detest more than slavery, But try as I might, My eyes are inevitably drawn, Not to the joyful faces of the free, But the still expressions of the dead. Insha'Allah. I tell myself That what happens on the battlefield Is the will of allah, But the truth is, They are dead, and I am not, And I prefer it that way. Look, you freed these people. They're going to want to thank you, So why don't you try and look like You think you did the right thing, eh? Aw, hell. Why not? Matt, don't! It appears you were correct, Mr. Ellman. You are hopelessly obstinate and disruptive. I've been trying to explain To your friend, Mr. Ellman, That Mr. Burton is only doing What is necessary, What is right. It is the others Who are wrong. I'm pleased to see that you at least agree with me. You're wrong. I understand why richard wants to destroy this world, But I never agreed with his methods. He is a man from another era, One less sentimental than your own, But that does not negate his logic. It negates everything. He's a dangerous man who has to be stopped. Jessie... Don't say any more. I see. Then as long as your attachment remains with Mr. Ellman, You are compromising yourself, And our efforts. Unless you convince me otherwise, Neither of you will ever see the light of day again. No, no! I'll be waiting, come find me. Come find me, Matthew. Phantom... More treachery! Not that you weren't a gracious host, But I got to run. Your grailband, my dear. Pardon? I'm unbound, and I'm famished. Destroying the world as we know it Can work up quite an appetite. What the hell's in there? The fusion reactor. It was given to Sam. We must be near a grailstone. It's sending energy to the orb inside. I've been thinking, Each grailstone we pass Is more powerful than the last. That means we have to stop Burton now, Before he gets to the source itself. Okay, let's do this. No, no. It's too dangerous. Here. She told me "he" would be waiting And would need my help, And she did not say which "he." I hope you're not disappointed. It is always a pleasure to serve a friend. Matthew. Okay, so what now? I'm going to help you. Where are we? No idea. Tomoe, the caretaker, Did she say anything about Jessie? No, nothing. She was with me in that prison, At least a vision of her. Did she speak to you? She said she'd be waiting. But where? Too many questions obscure the path. What is it? I think I've been here before. When? First, you must prostrate yourself. Forehead, palms, knees and toes touch the ground. You got to admire the man For sticking to his guns, Theologically speaking. Well, we're going to need all the prayers we can get. Since climbing those mountains Looks to be suicide? Basically. Then we'd all be scattered, lost, And I'd have no chance Of ever finding Antonio again. Don't get me wrong. I'm going. I just don't like the odds. Well, if I played the odds, I'd have been an attorney. Hell, even the real huck finn Had more sense than me. He ended up a justice of the peace. Time to roll the dice. Did I hear someone say "dice"? Mr. Porter, you are too much. Roast squab with honey. This is a dish I haven't sampled Since cairo. I'm glad to be of service, With every dish you desire. Saboteurs! The prisoners are escaping! Get them! Imbeciles... You, go, save yourself! No! Listen, you saved me earlier. We're in this together. Come on, let's go! That way. No, I can't. I can't go any further. No. No! The bomb goes off and Burton wins? Then we never get to see the people that we care about Ever again. No way. You think this is easy for me? That ship was my life. There's one way out of this. What, the suicide express? Is that even real? You have done it. Three times. No, I can't do that. Not because I am afraid. I have to believe Sam and Youseff and the others Are coming for us. If we never went to the club that night, Hal would still be with me. And if pigs had wings, They would be eagles. But I think not. I think a pig... Is just a pig. You know, I finally figured it out, Who you remind me of. When I was a student, there was a boy. He didn't like the idea of women becoming engineers, So he came to my school, And he shot every woman he could find. I remember when he aimed his rifle at me, His eyes were blank. Reality didn't matter. Other people's lives didn't matter, Only the puppet show inside his head. You have the same eyes. If you had seen what I have seen... Your eyes would be dead, too. Do people actually do this for fun? Well, it is an unassailable fact That, as a recreational activity, Mountain-climbing appeals chiefly to lunatics, Suicides, And the british. Like rugby. Are you trying to upstage me, Mr. Porter? Not likely, Mark Twain. Do you want to stand here Talking all day, Or do you want to climb a mountain? You know, sergeant mbaye, If I ever novelize our adventures, You will be facing a considerable rewrite. Matthew, where are we? What is wrong? This place, I don't know what's real anymore. Are you really here? Am I? Is any of this real? Matthew... I've got an idea, Why don't you And the rest of the blue man group Just kill each other And leave the rest of us the hell alone? You are asking the wrong question. Her lies and illusions mean nothing. Ask her about what does matter. Is Jessie alive? She is. Take me to her. You're so damn powerful, take me to her now! It's all about using her. I finally figured it out. I'm right, aren't I? You will find your friends Climbing that next mountain range. Burton is 400 miles to the north. You have only one more day to stop him. And how are we supposed to travel 400 miles In 24 hours? A ship... A ship that flies. A zeppelin. This doesn't bother you? Being used as puppets? Fighting a war we barely understand? Saving the world, Stopping evil, Rescuing the woman you love? I have fought wars for less. That's the first thing I've heard in days That makes any sense. Come on. I got you. Yeah, come on. We've got a long way to go. Come on. You're killing me. Sam... Sam! What do you want from us? It doesn't make any sense! You're a coward! You're a murderer! You're a yellow son of a bitch! I think... I think I'll... Just sit here for a while and... Look out at the world. Come on, gentlemen. Let's find Antonio and the others. I want my damn boat back. Okay, pal, sorry to do this, But the lady and I need a ride. You the pilot? Then you're going to help us Get on that machine, okay? Now, I'm going to take my hand away, But if you scream... Let's just say The little lady doesn't like loud noises. Okay? You folks in some kind of trouble, Or are you looking for some? Maybe a little of both. Aces. I love a good dust-up. Eddie chung, nice to meet you... - Edward! - Hey, boss! Is everything all right? Yeah, yeah, just picked up a couple hitchhikers here. Guys, this is ludwig durr, The man who built the hindenburg. Matt Ellman. Wie geht's? This is my friend, Tomoe Gozen. Tomoe Gozen? I am a student of the ancient warriors. Hercules, achilles, Even alexander the great, But to meet Tomoe Gozen is indeed a fantastic honor. Hajimemashite! Hajimemashite. Come! To the herumferzen, ja? It's a dead end. Dead end... No food, no water, And now nowhere to go? Well, on the bright side, We're already dead! All right, all right, we... I suppose we'll just have to double back, Look for another route. Double back? Yes. Double back... Or we could fly. Now, is that some kind of senegalese aphorism? Faith in allah will give us wings? Or maybe mohammed can move this damn mountain Out of our way? No, what he meant was... We could fly. We could fly. Hello! We can fly! There they are. I see them. Dead slow. You miss me, brother? Look, man, don't be hugging me, man. Watching you die shook me up. Oh, well, I'm sorry, man. Next time I die, I'll tell you to look away. All right, dumbass. So, we catch up to Burton and those guys, And then what? Then we take the boat back. Oh, okay, And how exactly are you planning to do that? Repairs complete, captain. All ahead full, comrade Evgeny. We have a lot of time to make up. Yes, sir. And this is the observation room. It is as precise a replication of the original designs As I could create Under these difficult conditions. Well, that clock's still a few minutes off There, ludwig. The clock is not off, Edward. The planet is off. She's a most magnificent vessel, mein herr. Ludwig, in your travels, How much of the riverworld have you seen? Oh, only a small portion. - Danke. - Bitte. The planet is so vast. By my calculations, It is over 100 times the size of the earth. Well, the almighty did a pretty good job Of making man feel puny on earth. What do the gods intend here? That seems to be the question of the day. What the hell happened on earth? I mean, I've heard that it was blown up Or obliterated by someone or something, So if anybody's heard anything, Now's the time to share. It is possible that there was a... An event. As a man who makes a modest living Toiling as a wordsmith, I would have to say that if the lovely blue planet, Which had been my home for some 75 years, Was suddenly and irrevocably reduced To ash and cinder, The word "event" Is hardly the one I would choose to employ. Pardon me, But it is an acceptable scientific term. Besides, we have no proof, Only speculation, That the earth was attacked And destroyed. I knew it. I knew I wasn't killed By my downstairs neighbor leaving the gas on again. Attacked by whom? I have no answer for that. If you will excuse me. I must speak to Edward. The starboard rudder is off by two degrees. If you don't mind. Not at all. Enjoy. She might be gone. Mother earth. She may be no more. You seem troubled, Matthew. I do? What were you looking for Out there? I don't know. Answers... Guidance. You are trying too hard. Just... Be. Yeah? My mother used to say that. Well, not exactly that. She'd tell me to stop thinking so much. Be Matthew. The rest will follow. Do not worry. I did not come here to interfere. Good. So how about you drop me off Somewhere inside. I want to be sure that you grasp The seriousness of what you're about to do. Oh, I'm getting the serious part. You will condemn yourself and your kind To an eternity of torture, Including your beloved Jessie. What do you know about Jess? In fact, what the hell do you know about anything human? Yes, you are correct. I know little of your kind, But I do have the advantage To be able to foretell certain events. Based on our projections... Screw your projections. You want to stop me from killing Burton, Throw me off, right here, right now. Please... You know we are only able to intercede On a limited basis. Oh, really? So back in the bat cave That was only a limited version Of water-boarding? I only came here today to suggest that you turn back. What lies ahead will haunt you and your race for a very long time. a strange woman in a hooded robe That seems we all have the same mysterious benefactor And the same enemies. Burton's caretaker was just here. One of the salvations We had an interesting conversation on the starboard wing. What? Don't worry, we didn't bend anything. I'm gonna have to now assume that sir dick knows we're coming after him. And he will be prepared. You have my solemn oath that I will never abandon this ship. On my life. One thing is for certain... It shall be one hell of a contest. On the rocks. Bring her around. Bring her around. Get out. I was surprised to get your message. I trust you know what this means for us. I hear too many sweets can kill you. The captain's not here. He's busy. Yes, I am aware of that. But a big strong man like you must be hungry, no? You know he'll kill me if he saw me take any of this. Of course, he'll kill me anyway. Still, I want to be around a little longer. Hey, guys, come here, have a look. There she is. Dead ahead. Time to take back that which is mine. My apologies, that which is ours. No, Sam, she's all yours, And I'm not talking about the boat. I thank you, sir. What is that? The dark tower. I've heard of it. I was never sure it really existed. The dark tower? Otherwise known as the source. The source from which this river flows, the source of all things along its banks, both good and bad. Gentlemen, I believe a new day is upon us. Captain, sir, you might want to come see this. Friends of yours? If I had friends that could fly, Why would I steal this thing? Shoot them! Shoot them out of the sky! Rocket! Keep firing. We're hit! Port-side engine! Feathering prop now! Eddie, we need to stop them from firing. You need to get us down there fast. Getting down there fast will not be a problem. Well, how about stopping? Is that going to be a problem? Okay, now I'm mad. Bring them down, gentlemen. Whatever you have to do, bring that damn thing down. Clever little minx. A beautiful ship. Boss! I don't know how much longer this thing'll hold together. All right, now, what did you call This technique again, Mr. Porter? Jumping! Okay, Sam, it's not a riverboat, But you're still the captain. What do you say? Seems like a damn fool idea to me! And that's exactly why I like it! Who's next? Okay, let's go. Go, Eddie. Save yourself. Ludwig, what about you? If I am to die, I prefer to go facing into the wind. Just like old times, huh? Ain't no thing. We'll use this. Don't rush me. This takes time. You okay? I seem to be afraid of heights. Keep your eyes on me the whole time, you don't let go until I say. Okay? What about our two little mice? What about them? Ludwig, we're coming in fast. Drop it! Allahakbar! Brace yourself! When this is over, I am going to have to teach you how to fight. When this is over, I never want to see a sword again. Just like a man To only show up for dessert. My darling, You never cease to amaze me. Don't get sentimental. I'm only backing the winner, As always. I assure you, I have no time for sentiment. I did a little baking for the boys. Allegra Braccioforte... - Amore mio... You make me crazy. When's this going to end? Give me a shovel. Matthew, Burton. - Help! - Help us! Fire! Help us! Come on! Inside! Help us, please! Amelie? Matthew? Down here! Over here. Amelie, get out of there! Where's Simon? I thought he was with you. Have you seen Burton? We are too late. - Matt! - Brother, you scared me. What happened? I missed the boat, literally and figuratively. I came down in the trees over there, and I just... I just knocked myself out. That's a bad one. I'm sorry you've been dragged into this. Let's get you out of here... Just stay here till I get back, okay? Matthew! I am coming with you. Tomoe... It might not be the best idea. It was not a question. Our fates are entangled somehow. I want to see how it ends. Get out of here! If something goes wrong up there, Or it goes bad down here, Don't sweat it. We'll see each other in the next life, right? Okay? Right? Right. Go on! Tomoe, behind you! Lay still, lay still. Burton! Lay still. Yoshinaka... Never would have let one soldier Delay his mission, Not even me. You know, I got to tell you, This yoshinaka guy of yours, He doesn't sound that great. You are a true warrior, Matthew... And as such, Never allow the indulgence of self-doubt To cloud your vision. He's not with us. Well, where is he? Where's Hal? I am sorry, But somewhere down the river, There's always a chance he may be there. I just want this nightmare to end. Well, you may get your wish. What the hell... No, stop. Jesse? You said he wouldn't be here. Who? Who are you talking about? You! I don't understand, Jess. Is this you? Are you real? Or is this another one of their chess games? Chess... One of my favorites. Mine, too. Your move. No, his. I'm sorry, Matt. So, this was all planned? A charade? Everything in the prison cell? Why? You weren't supposed to be here. Why couldn't you just give up, Stop looking for me? We tried to tell you. Does he really mean this much to you? Matt, this isn't about him. I know you, Jess. There is nothing that would ever turn you To something like this. Never, not without him. Don't fool yourself. Look, this world isn't a dream, It's a nightmare... One that has to stop. Matt... I love you. I will always love you. Jess... This world is our home now. It's all that's left. Everything else is gone. If you destroy it, there will be nothing. We will be nothing. Look at me. Jess. Look at me. I can't. Why are you doing this? You ever heard about rat-baiting? In the east end, The common folk would catch rats And make them fight each other for sport. That's what the riverworld is. It's a vast barrel filled to the brim With the most dangerous vermin ever created, Humans, Battling each other for someone else's pleasure. It's a game! And it's one I intend to end, Now, on my terms. So, it's a game, and you don't want to play. I get that. I'm not sure I want to play, But what gives you the right To make that decision for everyone else? It's the only way! There's no escape. Finally, they gift us with their presence. If there's a God in this place I sincerely hope he's on our side Or impartial at the worst. I thought you didn't believe in God. I don't. I'm merely thinking of the rest of you. Our lords and masters. You want to save this place? Then do something! Stop me! No, because you are cowards. You are murderous cowards! Come on, Jess! Are you with me, girl? I don't know anymore. How many days? How many days did you have with her? I had eight weeks. That's it. That's all I was given. But you know something? I'll take it. Those memories... You want them wiped out? Obliterated? Richard... Please. You are right. You are both... Right. I'm being selfish and irrational, And perhaps the rest of the rats Deserve a chance at such happiness, And I am not a hero, Or a builder, or... Someone who makes things better. See, I'm a different kind of rat. I'm a biter, And I'm damned well going to bite! Burton, no! Run, Getty. See you again, brother. I am just gathering  It is so good to see you my friend. You too. How long have you been here? Just one day. Have you seen any of the others? You are the first, Which feels right. It makes me happy. Do you know what happened? It is all a bit confusing. Do you? I thought we were at the end of the world, But apparently not. I honestly don't know if it was all a dream. Is that not how life is? But hearing you again, I think we may have been dreaming the same dream. You were hurt, right? Yes. And you had found Jessie. That's right. I did. But then what? Everyone is waiting for you. Oh, you... Ugh, stop hugging me! Dude! I dropped a tear for you! It's good to see you, brother. It's good to see you, too, man. We've got lots to talk about. Matthew... Assalamu alaikum. Welcome back, my brother. It's good to see you, my friend. Yes. Captain Sam Clemens, at your service. Sam... Well... Here's to old friends. Jessie... Where is she? We were hoping... hoping you might know more about that. No, I just got here myself. She's bound to be here soon, right? How long have you been here? Just long enough To get the boat back in ship shape. I remain determined to go back to the source, To unravel this mystery, Claim this world as our own. Is this the same boat? Not exactly. So you've been here long enough to build a new one? Aw, got great sea legs, this girl. You survived, and we didn't, is that it? None of us survived, Matt. Sam and I were just the first ones back. We've been collecting everyone else since then. How long? It's been eight years. Eight years? Son, if history has taught us anything, If this place has educated us in the ways of this life... We all have to know there is hope. Matt, there's aloways gonna be hope. You did well, Matthew Ellman. I didn't do anything. It may not have seemed like much, but... You saved this world. By forcing Burton off the tower, The vessel's force field prevented the blast From fusing with the planet's power source. I didn't force him to do anything He wasn't already prepared to do. A sequence of events leads to a consequence. You were principal to that sequence. Without you, The result would have been catastrophic. We all died. You're here now, aren't you? Not all of us. Where is she? I don't know. You're lying. Like you, Jessie has no grailband. I can't track her. Then how... You can track my friends. So as long as I'm with them, You know where to find me. Your sense of loyalty Was one of the reasons why we chose you. I didn't ask to be chosen. In fact, I'd rather be unchosen. When the time is right, Matthew, Once you have fulfilled your destiny. What destiny? I just want to find Jessie! And so you shall, my friend. And so you shall. Aw, hell, it's not like there's any hurry. We're going to be here a while, And that's a certainty, A damned dead certainty if ever there was one. Full speed ahead, Mr. Youseff! We've got a long river to run.
