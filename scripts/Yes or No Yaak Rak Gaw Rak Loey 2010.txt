Keeping secret from you? You're so smart, I couldn't trick you. But I want you to know that I'm very glad that I can change the room. No, please don't... I can handle it myself, no problem. You don't have to worry. I love you, mom. Jub Jub Jub 1,000 times Jub Jub. I also love you, dear. Jub Jub Jub back 1,000 times. Yes. "Nice to meet you mate" O Pie O Don't come in! Don't! It's you who should be back off! Hold on, I'm hurt. You're a girl? What! I'm a girl You're not going to apologize? For what? It's because you look like this and you're suddenly jumped to me so I was frightened. Don't you see this house-size cockroach? And this is my room. Your room? Oh, I Ran away from a Dii (used to call Tomboy's girlfriend) just to meet a tom. Hey, no no no! I'm not a tom. You're not a tom even though you look like this? I'm really not a tom, I'm a girl. Umm, A girl? A girl like this? Oh, so feminine... look at your face, hair style, personality, body... Where? Which parts of you look like a girl, tell me? P' Kae. I can't be patient with this. Let me change the room. -Why? You just changed your room? -I can't bear this, VERY TOM DII Hey, I don't mean that she's disgusting or anything but you know it's very difficult to live with her. Now, I feel like I'm being with a man. I'm not comfortable living with a tom. How uncomfortable? It's tough Teacher. I just can't restraint my mind. You will be getting used to it. Tom or not, if you don't interest, then it's no big deal. But I have the right to change? Yes, you have. But you have used it already. And I don't approve. Hey As I was here before you. I'd like to take the right... Listen to me now. I'll be at this side, and you're on that side. This is the territory line, don't cross this line. I like silentness because my fish can be easily frightened. You can't understand. It's difficult to treat. Oh, and it's better to be quiet, if you can. How about singing? If you think you're a good singer, go on. Silence is better than singing like this. Can I cook? Actually, it's against the rule If the flat maids know, you'll have to move out. Well, just do it. How can I use the bathroom with this line separating us? -Climb on top of it -Ok "Nice to meet you, mate" O Pie O Ok The landlord isn't home. Hey, they come. -Oh -Are you ok? -My heart.. My heart is melting. -Oh. -Moron! -Oh, they just said that at the same time. -Oh, my heart hurts. -Why? -I just met a girl who's more handsome than me. -Hey, you're so handsome. You use Mr. or Miss? -I'm happy now. -Hey sis, where're you going? You can blow the nose, I don't mind. Who have you met this time? I don't know but... like I got a jackpot. Even E' Nerd was trembling. E' Nerd was trembling? She won't have any reaction even if there's a disaster. I don't know, I feel like she understand me in the way that nobody can. Who? Understand your blind side nobody can see? How about the senior you cried for? Don't speak about that, I'm in a bad mood now. You were just rampaging and everything almost fell down. Hey, Nerd. Can you sense that Jane's falling in love? I'm sorry but I need concentration. The noise didn't come out. Cause you had so much acting, like... It's noisy eventually. And it kept flashing the light. How about you change the side? Pie, do you have anything to eat? I'm hungry. Pie, come with me. Hey, who's that? Your roommate? -Don't tell me... -Yes, she is.. -the one that I told you. Do you think she's handsome? -Meh Hey, why? I think we should exchange our rooms? Ok? Oh and about Nerd.. Nerd is quiet.. What size of battery she use? Very sluggish. -Btw, what's her name? -Uh, I don't know. Hey, why didn't you ask her? Hurry up, ask her. You. About yesterday... thank you. We meet again. So, did you blow the nose? Crazy! I didn't but I washed it already, I'll give it back later. -My name's Jane -My name's Kim My name's Pie and I'm not a bridge to connect anyone. And what plant are you're planting? -Are you a agriculture student? -Yes I'm from a farmer family. For me? It's beautiful, what plant is it? Love at first sight. You love me? No, the plant's name. Can you find your way to the right room, Jane? "It's delicious" ^o^ I'm sorry, I was trying not to do.. but the noise couldn't be lower. Hey, I don't mind the matter like this. Are you hungry? Today I cooked a special recipe. You can cook inside the cooker? What's it? It's called roasted chicken. It has many things inside. Mushroom, vegetable, full of nutrition. Wanna try? It's delicious. How about it? Good, right? So so You like to cook? It's fun whether it's delicious or not. And what about the plant outside? Krapao, Horapa that sort of vegetable. If I need them to cook, just pick it up. No need to buy. So, do you like cooking or planting? I like both... How about you, Pie? You like fish? Yeah What is it doing? -Actually? -What? Actually is the fish name, but the breed is little dolphin -The name is cute -Is it a dolphin? -No, it's not but they look like dolphin so we call them little dolphin. It's a short nose- trunk fish, it's imported. There's only one inside, doesn't it feel lonely? It's very cruel, nobody can live with. Don't you try bringing another fish. It'll growl at the new one. Like its owner? Hey It's just being selective who to be friend with. Is there any fish that look like tom? I don't know but there're kinds of fish that like to be with the same gender. Any fish that doesn't like a tom-look alike fish? I give you another chance. I'm just kidding. Don't be frown like a mackerel. But she can do all that herself, P'Van. Yes, inside a cooker. It's delicious. Strangely delicious. Hey, P'Van you know she's very tom....so don't tell my mom. Everyone will think that she's a man. Ei Ei I don't know how long I can bear with her. My mom will have goosebumps. You can blow your nose if you want. You miss me, dear? How's the plant I gave? Kinda complicated but I can handle it. You can tell me if you have any problem. I will tell you when it needs to be fertilized. -Play game with me? -Yes Sorry. The music is nice. Hey, it's not a song, game game. You think this is the right place? It should be. The security guard told us. Surely Uni is a great place. Omg! I can't believe. Are you a girl or an angle? Excuse me. -Is this 'A' building girl dorm? -Yes -Is this your car? -Yes You can't park here. You should park at that side. I'll take you there. It's ok, I think I can go myself. Thank you. Hey hey, come in let's clear this out. We have the same hairstyle maybe we're soul mate. Where're you going? You don't have to fight, Pei can handle both of you. Double pack! I like it. -P' Ood -Hello, Khun Kim -Hi I only want a few of them. -Where should we put them? -Well, you can't go inside, so please lay them down here. Here -Are you going anywhere else? -Yes, I have to deliver them to many places. -Do you need anything? -It's ok, I'll go to aunt In's cafe myself. -Good bye -Bye ka Hmm who's N' Pei huh, E' Boy? Do you know this place? P' In's cafe, it's at the back of the uni. Could you take me, Pie? I have to go with Boy, so go by yourself. Not difficult to find. Go left to the pool direction, at the end take two rights. When you see a small area to the left, turn to that street, get out of that street, 5 mins and you'll be there. Oh, and it opens in the evening. Out of the building, turn left... Turn right 2 times... when you're at a small junction, turn left. Turn to that street, out of the street.... 5 mins and you'll be there. Turn to that street... out of the street, 5 mins and... it's dark. Hey, you can't find it? I'm lost. Where is Boy? He went with the girl gang. Why you're not asking somebody else for help? No, I don't want somebody else to take me. Could you take me? Ok, it's the thank for roasted chicken. Too much, Too much. Aren't you going? I won't take you anymore. One... Two... Three. You can stand up yourself. You're so smart So cruel that the fountain stops itself. You want to see the whole Uni has blackout. P' ka Is aunt In here? -Kim -Aunt In Little brat You look so handsome. How are you? -You're also more beautiful -Really? It's just a little bit. Dad send me a new wine for you to test. Wine? I'm thirsty now. Hello. You have a good taste. Your girlfriend? She's cute. -No No No, a friend -Heay!! I'm kidding, don't be so alert. -Good -Kim Come up here. Seems like every time I meet you, my heart is weaken more and more. I want to speak with you, greet with you. And why do I have to be shy? I can't endure the feeling when I meet... you.. May I ask you something? Is P' In tom? Come on, I just want to know. -I don't know -Nahhh I really don't know because I'm not a tom. Hey, Kim....I want to speak frankly nobody think that you're not a tom. I'm serious The more you say No, the more you are. Ok, so please tell me... what is tom? They're like you. Act like you. They aren't feminine at all and have girl lovers. Some of them act like they're so gentlemen, as if they're real men. Oh I see, like the dorm teacher? -Yes -So, I... don't look like a girl... and I "don't" like girls... and I'm not so manly. Who am I, then? Have you had someone you love? Have you liked someone? No Both men and women? So do I If I like someone...like to speak with...like to play with and like to be with but if she's a girl, that means I'm a tom? Will it change the meaning of being myself, Pie? I still like to play game, like to cook roasted chicken and everything is the same. What about other elements of mine? Will anyone see them? Other than "You are a tom" We have a trouble. -Let see, the mother is going to bombard -Pie What a mess! I bought it myself. The water wth! You can sleep on my bed. I'll sleep on the floor. No, it's alright Hey I'm not serious, you can cross my line. Are you sure? Sure, I'm a farmer's daughter. Sleeping on the solid floor is ok, I'm good. I know it! Why do you afraid of ghost? -People are frightened because of ghost, but you're not? -No What are you afraid of, tom? Crazy, I'm not afraid. Just don't like them. I understand because I don't like darkness, silentness so I have to make some noise. Because I'm afraid. You don't like me to play, right? So you won't be afraid. I'm not good. Don't be reluctant when you have the opportunity to play, huh? The mother will pound your head. A sadist Gay queen. You... You know who... who's keeping an eye on you only. In everywhere you go. But you're the one who... are at odds with me everyday... I keep it for long If I have a chance to be near you, I'll tell you to know my feeling make eye contact with me to see something inside... you'll understand the meaning... Do you see someone inside my eyes? Do you see yourself inside them? Can you understand me? See what I'm thinking? I've seen you for a long time, you know? Never look at any other place. Just one more time you turn to me, meet my eyes once again. One more time. If only you look at me and tell me what're you thinking. Someday that you have to walk beside me... just you understand me... I like water Actually, I like jelly fish the most. I like when they're swimming freely they're so soft, lightly, floating like...I can't describe I like to have one, but it's difficult. We're bad mouth. But we really have fun. -My eyes hurt -Why, friend? Cause love blow inside my eyes. -But I feel annoyed -Why? It's like losing a city to be a tom's colony. We'll sing this song for them.... Ching Chub Ching Chub (Use to tease girl-girl lovers, very very rude) Please, don't be too much. I think you should protect the natural because our ecosystem is in very bad situation now. If I tended to protect the natural and got men like you... I'd be better at the Ching-Chub tour It's funnier. -What? Ching-Chub tour? -Let's go, darling. -Waste of time -Hey, you Hold on, lemme ask something Don't you have goosebumps when you two kiss? That couple won't have goosebumps.. but if it were you guys and me... So much fun for sure. Why you have to stop? Hey, that's P'Van? P' Van Hello Hello N' Pie, your mom told me to pick you up for dinner. This is Kim, my roommate and this is P' Van -Hello -I'm her boyfriend Is this N' Kim that can cook inside a cooker? You're very good. -You want to go now? -Let's go, Pie Let me help Boy, do you think this couple is ok? Ok, good- looking and good manner. But I don't like this kind of guy, too boring. Yes, me too. Yes, not spicy at all, you have to add a lot of sauce and chili. -Pie likes to eat this kind of thing? -But Pie doesn't like to eat something strange How strange? My family call me and you as normal people. Do you think Pie will call us as normal people? Hello, aunt In. I'm hungry, one cup of milk please. Thank you ka. Delicious? Not delicious? What's going on? Your face looks like bottom now. No, I'm just bored. Bored? You came here alone, did you have a quarrel with Pie? No, she's with her family. A man picked her up. My cake isn't delicious because of that. Aunt In please don't laugh.... You like her? Who? What? You're so non-sense. Can I ask you frankly.. you act manly I know and what about inside of you? Inside? You mean me being tom? There're people who look like you but they are not. Or they don't look like this, but they are. Actually, this comes from inside not characteristic. Don't let it decides who you are You should be what you are inside. I saw you two always giggle In what way you like her? -Friend, a friend -Are you sure? Look carefully, both your body and your heart, look what you should do. So you don't have to be sorry later. Pie, could I pick you up for the cinema later? P' Van, please don't speak like that again. Speak what? You spoke that I'm your girlfriend in front of my friends. My girlfriend? P' Van, I've never told you that I'm your girlfriend. Pie I'm sorry I won't speak like that again. I'll wait for you to speak it yourself. Nah, It's no big deal, right? Don't be frown like a Mackerel. -Kim -Huh? Are you sleep? Why went to bed this early? Why not turning on the bed light? I'm sick. I have a migraine. I'll feel worse when seeing the light. Did you take pill? Yes. Only taking pill is not enough, you know? You have to get massage. Come on, I'll do it. If not feeling better, then get up to the head. Air condition is off. -Huh, what? -It's too hot I can't bear it. -So, you're... -Let me sleep here. Which bed? Actually, it doesn't matter your bed is ok, but Kim's bed is better. She's not well, has a migraine. Really? How do you feel? Too much headache? Let me massage you. Jane, Kim's head is damaging now. Let her sleep. Sleep with me ok? P' In's Cafe, Yes or no? Crazy Hey, where are we going today? Wanna eat pork on a hot plate? I'm hungry now that I see your face. She's right to the point. But it has bad smell, let go to P' In's instead? Go? Let's go? No, I'm lazy. Come one, I'll treat you cake. No, I always eat cake when I have a bad mood, today I'm in a very good mood. Hmm, right to the point again. Boy.. I also want to go to P' In's we could listen to her music. So, do you want to go, Pie? No, I'm lazy. Got it? Not much left? Let put it here. Ok, that's enough "Seeing each other by our eyes" "sensing each other by our hearts" "but it looks like our love is backtracking" "till I can't reach it, grab it' "You're so close to me" "just a breathe away." "But why.." "love is on the far end of skyline?" Hello, P' Van "Every other one has a dream." Hi? "Every other one has a dream." I'm bored. "Every other one has a dream." Tell something funny "Loving you..." Very funny, his fart smelled really bad and that the others... "Loving you..." "...is impossible." I'm going outside a moment. "....impossible" I'll be right back. Are you going for long? -A few mins -I wait here. And everyone was like.... -It's very shameful -Hold on, another call's coming. Hello. -Where are you? -The fountain garden. What're you doing? Being on a call with P'Van. He told that the sunset was very beautiful. -So? Hey, I got some news for you.. Where's your girlfriend? Why did you call someone else? Who do you mean? Ah, It's Jane. Which one do you want me to tell first, about Jane is not my girlfriend or Pie is not someone else? If I'm not someone else, who am I? "You're so close to me just a breathe away" "Just a word" "Love is just a word" "Like it's embedded in my heart" "I don't know when I can tell you" "Want to tell you once" "that I love you so much" "but telling you my love...." "is impossible." "impossible" Pie, are you P' Van's girlfriend? No, I'm not.. We're close since we're children. -Sure? -Yep My mom told me, if we like someone, we'll feel like there are hundred of butterflies flying in our stomaches. And sometime they're flying...here. Like..having no weight?. Maybe, I don't know. But for P' Van, even a caterpillar never come in. Have you felt like that? With girls or boys? Since my mom passed away, my dad was a big playboy. So many girls around He told that mom is his love when she's not there, he can't use love And he also told that love can't be something else if we love someone, that's when the love comes. Pie If someday I happen to love a girl, will you still be my friend? Pie, Kim Pie..Kim I'm tired Why we have to do something like this on holiday? -Are you alright, teenager? -My age isn't capable anymore. When will it finish? What kind of project is this? So tired. Come on. Let's sit around there. I like to eat sweet. Not giving to me at all? Hey, it's not something people share. It depends on our heart, come one share some. Many butterflies around here. -Maybe they just escaped? -Huh, where? -When I opened my mouth just before. -Huh? There are butterflies inside my stomach a long time ago, Pie. Where are you going, girls? -P' Van -Surprise. What took you here? My mom requested you to pick me? I used to tell you that I'll take you to the cinema. Uh, but why didn't you call me first? If you're not free, it's ok. If you have something to do, I can wait for later. Where're you two going? I can drive you. Jatujak market. Two of you, where were you going last night? And where're you going again? Why didn't you invite me? So bad Can I go too? You should ask Pie cause even me couldn't go with them. Why, Pie? You only want to go with Kim? No, if you want, it's ok. Everyone of us. -It's good P' Van, let go with them? Ok krab. Jane, let's go. -Hey hey Pie, look. -Huh? -I want this, will you buy it for me? -Um, yes -P' Van, let's go there. -Ok. This one is nice. -Hey I forgot the shopping bag. -Where? I'll get it. I can't remember which street, I'll go with you. No no you don't. I'll take her, it's on that street. Come on Pie, I'll show you. We'll be right back. If Pie's mom saw these 4 girls, she would be faint. I don't know if Pie has told you or not. Her mom doesn't like something like this. What kind of thing, P' Van? Like... Girls that look so much like boys. This is the elder thought. Being tom is so disgusting, P' Van? I don't intend to blame you Pie told me that if I'm a tom, things will get very complicated like many girls will be around me. I can confirm Pie is not among them. And I believe that Pie's not going to be against the natural like that. Pie, she's not there. Then go back. Kim Where did you go? Kim, what's wrong? You think you can do whatever you want, and you can go anywhere you like. I've called you for hundred times why didn't you pick up? Your period hasn't come? It's good, right? You could be with your boyfriend. How many times you want me to tell? P' Van is not my boyfriend. Hey, and can you look back at yourself? How about you and Jane? You guys walked so close like a twin. Don't act like this, I don't like. I knew You don't like whatever I am. You don't like me. Good that you know. So you will understand. Don't beg for any interest, cause you won't get it. It's annoying. I like water Actually, I like jellyfish the most. I want to have one but it's difficult to treat. What're you doing? I'm not begging for your interest I'm not calling for anything. I did it because I wanted to. I understand that you don't like me I know it. Knowing that you won't like what I'm doing Hi, P' Van. Ok What time? Will you come to me first, or my mom? Ok See you. My mom told him to drive me to do some business, can I go? Are you alright, teenager? It's ok, you should go. Ok, be a good girl. Don't let Jane come in and rape you. I'm a jealous girl. I can tell Jane right away about us. Crazy I don't know what will happen after this. If there's anyone comes to ask me about us or... if there's anyone knows about us... That has nothing to do with us, we don't have to be ashamed no need to be afraid. I love you, Pie. I'm not ready, Kim. I don't want to tell anyone, do you understand me, Kim? Kim Here, eat the new recipe cake, the latest, very delicious. You should try. Lay it here, dear. -Pie, let's go to buy something to eat? -Where? In your dorm, huh? I've never met your friend. Call her what she would like to eat. She's not there, maybe she went back home. -Call her to be sure, ok? -Yes (the number you've dial....) -Kim -Huh -Kim -Huh What is you afraid of? True love (not) lose dis"tom". Aunt. Fail humor. Please come in. -My bathroom -Lovely You like to do something cute like this? cute. You like to pee? Please go on. Ok. You room is lovely. Good. Hello Ka, I came by to borrow Pie's book. (Very sweet girlish voice) Pie, my book? Pie Pie, your friend came to borrow book, hurry. Thank you. Good bye ka (Very girlish again) Pie, if she didn't speak, I thought that she's a man. -Who's that? Is she from the same faculty? -Some subjects. Eieie, I have goosebumps now, Eieiei. She didn't do any harm, mom. I know dear but I think it's very disgusting. Girls pretend to be boys and boys like to be girls...I think that... the society nowadays is very weird. Good that you weren't like that if so, I would be dead by now. Those toms like to cut their hair short, you see? And they like to say Krab Krab like they're men. Hey, get up to take the pills, come on. Can you get up? Ah, come on. Don't be a cry baby. -Can I not take them? -No Take them first, or you'll be worse. Take them So playful. I'll be back to have a launch with you after the exam. and...Do you have exam this afternoon? but I'll be back here first. You'll be tired, no need to do that. I have migraine, I won't be hungry. I'll have a dinner with you. I'll think about that later. But I won't be tired because of that... cause you're my girlfriend, right? Sleep well. I'll be back, ok? See you. Do you have any question? Where is Boy? He'll be on his own, it's the end of the exam. How many subjects left? One more, but I'll finish it tomorrow. And how about Kim? Kim has migraine, sleeping at the dorm. Oh? May we go to Rong Guea this summer, there're many cheap things?. Ok, ok interesting but... Should we go with P' Van? So we'll save the expense. I think we shouldn't, shopping with a man is not fun. Why? It's not like a woman? I'll think later.. it's also a good way. Pie We'll talk later, Jane. Why? Are you and Pie have something to hide? I'm sorry. I didn't think it was you, Jane. Who did you think? Pie? Aunt In, do you see Pie? No I don't Sit down, I'll get you some drink. Kim, come to speak with me now? What's the meaning of that? I told you that I mistook... Mistook? I've never thought that you're like this.. Good, I'll tell everyone about you and Pie. Are you mad? Yes, I'm very crazy. You'll regret for what you've done to me. Have a drink? Drink? 50% of stupid tom and dii... like to create attraction by committing suicide. Kim You think I'm not a good girl? No, you are ok, you are nice. So, why don't you love me? Love....isn't that easy. If that so, everyone in the world could fulfill her hope. Look at you and me, You love me but I got to love Pie. Do you understand? Then, can I ask you to stay with me? I can be with you as a friend, but not for something else. I know, I know. I feel bad enough. Dear, have some drink? You've been crying for an hour. Is there anything I should know? Or did P' Van do something bad to you, dear? Mom, if I don't love P' Van, will you feel bad? I won't regret, dear why would I have to? I'm not forcing you about P' Van, I just see you two usually go together so I thought you're ok with him. And if.... the one that I'm ok with... is not a man? Will you be angry at me? I have to apologize you first that day I pretended to borrow her book. Actually, I'm her roommate Umm, not to be surprise, you're so similar to me. But why did you have to lie to me? -Did Pie tell you to? -No, I did it myself. I happened to know that you don't like... people that look like... Ok, Ok You don't have to speak It's good that you understand. I and Pie are very close and.... I want to ask for your permission to be together with her. To be with her? I love her. What answer do you want? That you know... I can't accept these abnormal sexualities. So you came to my house, and asked to have a relationship with my daughter, What answer do you want? Forcing me to accept it and... that I should tell you that... please take care of each other...have a good love life? Let me tell you frankly, I don't think this kind of relationship will be last long. But I'm serious. Ok. If you tell me that you're serious, so let's prove if Pie is serious with this or not. Pie, come down here. Did you hear all that your friend said? -I'm sorry, mom -We can talk about that later.. but I want to know what happened. No, it's nothing. Kim I'm sorry. Do you think she's being serious? I understand. There's one thing I want to tell you, I didn't think that was Jane I was blindfold, you knew it. No need to explain it, you don't care, right? Pie, I'll go now. "Surrounding with many other people," "you pretend that we're not in love," "I don't deserve to be with you, right?" "It's like our love has to be underneath dark shadow." "I'd like to see you to be brave enough for the love." "I'm still waiting for your love right here." -Please take care of her. "And there's a path that's waiting for us not far from here" "For one day, I just want you to look up for the stars" "and don't be shy with the sky" "Or if you look down for dirt on the ground," "don't avoid anybody's eyes" "you don't have to feel anything" -P' Van, I'm sorry "For one day, I want you to dare to look at people's eyes" "and tell them we are in love" "There might be no one who would understand" "but it's alright if there are you and me." "This is the most important thing" "if one day you'd be brave enough" "For one day, I just want you to look up for the stars" "and don't be shy with the sky" "Or if you look down for dirt on the ground," "don't avoid anybody's eyes" "you don't have to feel anything" "For one day, I want you to dare to look at people's eyes" "and tell them we are in love" "For one day, I just want you to look up for the stars" "and don't be shy with the sky" "Or if you look down for dirt on the ground," "don't avoid anybody's eyes" "you don't have to feel anything" "For one day, I want you to dare to look at people's eyes" (One day that you'd be brave enough, we'll fly together) Hi, can you remember me? Boss, there's a girl who would like to meet Khun Kim. -Hello -Hello -A friend from? -From the uni. I want to ask for your permission.... -Are you Pie? -Yes This is the girl that our trouble maker speak about a lot she couldn't sleep or eat when she had to get back here. It's good that you come. You're cute. Please take care of her. She like to play game so she has bad eye sighted. And one more thing, don't ask her to cook often cause she won't study. -Um...I -Ood Tell out trouble maker that the wife is here. -I think we should take her. -That's ok, a glass of wine, girl? This way. Kim did a good job. How dare you! You left your girlfriend's photo in the dorm. I'm hurt, Pie. What? It's only a little matter. Kim I'm sorry. I was afraid. I was confused. I was afraid of everything, that my mom would be angry at me, that my friends would tease me, and that I was afraid of others' eyes. But now I know that.. if I'm still afraid, I'll lose you. I don't want to lose you. Is it too late? It's ok. I come too late. Pie It's ok, I'm ok. Thank you. Thanks that you dare to love me. Can you remember the butterflies story that you told me, mom? I know what it's like now. Is it love, mom? I love you, love P' van but never have butterflies. I can't remind that I have. Could you give me an opportunity, mom? Please give an opportunity to this love, I want to know if it's true... I want to know if it will make me fall to break my legs and arms. I don't want to keep curious about this for my whole life, I will find the answer. -I love you, mom. Jub Jub Jub 1000 times Jub. -Hey, don't cry. Are you alright, teenager?
