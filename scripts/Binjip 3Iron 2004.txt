So you took pictures as if it was your own home. Officer Lee, see if their owners reported a burglary. Yes, sir. You two. What did you steal from all these homes? This punk needs to learn a lesson.

The autopsy results have come out. It's not murder, it's lung cancer. What? Lung cancer? - Are they sure? - Yes, I understand. He was delicately shrouded. Apart from a real ceremony, he buried his body better than any son could. He doesn't seem like a bad person to me. - Wait outside. - Yes, sir. Well, you're free from the homicide charge. So how was she? You liked forcing her, right? What are you looking at? Don't smile. Your favorite plant over there... I knew you'd come back so I took good care of it. It looks healthy, doesn't it? I've thought things out and I'd been too much. I'll be good from now on. Okay, I won't if you don't want me to. I've changed, you see? Oh yeah, while you were gone, I sent plenty of money to your folks If it's that hard to withstand, then do what you like. Isn't he being too harsh? Smile again. Let go, you bastard! Son of a bitch! Sit down! Sit down! Prisoner 2904! Playing games with me, you punk? You scared me! Try that again. Today. you go hung")!- Don't pretend you're sleeping.

He did this, but you stayed still? Like this? Like this? Like this? Prisoner 2904! Prisoner 2904! You son of a bitch! Why do you keep hiding? Wanna disappear from the world altogether? If you pull that again, I'll kill you. Can I help you? Excuse me! - You're cleaning it again? - Hi, honey. Who is she? I don't know. Let her sleep. Where have you been? I told you to call me if you go out! Where have you been? You're behind me, aren't you? The human eye sees within the 180 degree angle. So you're hiding in the other 180 degrees? But that's impossible! You bastard! You need more practice. And take care of the shadow. And you'll have to calculate the human mind, idiot! You crazy bastard. Even if you cover all that what are you gonna do? Let's move out of here. First thing tomorrow. You're waiting for him to finish his sentence, aren't you? I'm right, aren't I? A moving service please. Hello? What's with you? Fine, then. Let's wait together for him. I dare you to come, you son of a bitch. Prisoner 2904! Your meal! Prisoner 2904!

What the hell's wrong with you? Are you mentally sick? You made me this way. Who's the girl who always calls late at night? Let's stop this. Did you just hear something? - What are you talking about? - Hold on. I think someone's in the house. Who cares whether someone's here or not. - I'm the idiot for trusting... - No, I'm certain someone's in here. - Don't play the psycho act with me. - Hold on. Someone's here for sure. So who's here? I swear someone's here. I don't wanna hear it! I don't trust you at all! You see? I told you someone was here. Oh my goodness! You scared me. I did? So how was your day? Good. Why didn't you tidy up the sofa? I did this morning. But why is it so messy? That's strange. Can't sleep? Want me to sing you a lullaby? I miss you, too. Wanna come over? Hey, it's weird. It feels like someone's in my place. Yeah. Then hurry up. So who's in your place? I didn't see anyone. I just felt it. That's impossible. Am I just being too sensitive? - Isn't this your work? - You haven't seen it yet? - Can I look at it? - Yup. - Stop it. - Come on. - I thought someone was here? - Let him watch. - What's wrong? - I think someone's watching I'm scared. You see? What did I tell you? What is it? Why'd you hang up an empty frame? It's creepy. I think someone's here. Could it be him? He's bad luck, that son of a bitch. Honey, stay still. What are you doing up? I love you. What? Honey... Breakfast is ready! What's made you so happy? Stop smiling and eat. It's strange. It feels like someone's been here since last night. What are you laughing for? Are you that happy? Don't open the door to just anybody.
