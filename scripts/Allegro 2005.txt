Well, almost that simple. Let's take it from the beginning. Let's draw a line... Zetterstrm is born... here. In the years to come he grows older, bigger and more experienced - - as one does. In many ways he's an ordinary boy. He tastes his first soft ice - - kisses his first girl - - tries the local merry-go-round - - but one day he listens to a record with Michelangeli, the pianist - - which leaves a lasting impression on him. In music he finds calmness, a hiding place - - where he can elude life's disappointments. Shit! There, now... Come again. - Dammit! - Mind your language, please! - Shit... - You play wonderfully. Come and sit down. - Don't give me that attitude. - I can't play it. Yes, you can. Everyone makes mistakes. It's only to be expected. You don't believe me? Why don't you ever believe what I tell you? It's very frustrating. How can I teach you, if you don't believe me? Come and sit down. Zetterstrm, I know you can. Play something more delicate. Zetterstrm's teacher tries in her own way to help, but in vain. The secret behind his success is also the key to his failure. His quest for perfection brings him closer to music - - yet further and further away from life itself. But deep within, where even he cannot see, he yearns... ... he yearns for love. I don't believe it! Is something the matter? No, I just seem to have lost my keys. Or forgotten them. - Did you just lose them? - No, it probably happened ages ago. It doesn't matter. Forget it. I'll have to call a locksmith. Why are you so dressed up? It's because... I was playing. I hate this thing! - Can I help you? - I don't think I can... What the hell is wrong? Let me see... You want it off? Here you go... It's nice. You think so? Then keep it. - No. - I hate it. Take it. Please. - Really? - Yes, I hate it. - Why do you wear it then? - It goes with the territory. Nothing goes with the territory. Just don't wear it. Make it your trademark. Are you coming? You could always sit here and think about it. I could keep you company. Would you like that? Would I like that? - Does that seem strange to you? - Yes. Well, no... maybe not. Well, if that isn't one of life's ironic twists... A little mistake introduces him to Andrea, who becomes his great love. In no particular order they experience happiness, sorrow, loss - - and tenderness. Where are you going? - To play. - Now? - Aren't you tired? - No. You're very beautiful. You make me very happy. God, if you didn't exist... I'd have to build you. Why? You make me play better. Is that the only reason? I feel almost human when I'm with you. - Almost? - Yes. No need to exaggerate. - Yes? - You'll be there shortly, right? Yes. I'm almost ready. - I'll be there, darling. See you soon. - Bye. Go on. Get moving. - Hi. Are you ready? - Yes. - Where's Andrea? - On her way. Is everything ready? Yes... Shall we wait for her? - No, she'll be right over. - Let's go upstairs then. - Is something the matter? - No, I can't seem to find Andrea. - I don't think she's been here. - She was at the back of the room. No, she wasn't. That's where I was standing. - Do you think something is wrong? - No, of course not. I don't think she just left me. Will I regret we're together? No, why should you? Andrea has gone. Now what? Zetterstrm decides to forget. Quite simply. All his sorrows and joys. Everything he has experienced till now. Even Andrea is tucked away. I can hear what you're thinking: "You can't do that!" But yes, Zetterstrm can. The boy is very talented. The years pass by, and Zetterstrm reaps the fruits of his talent. He feels no need to look back to the country and the memories he left. But Denmark has not forgotten. It's hard to say what happened. But let me try. The past that Zetterstrm left behind explodes. At the place where Zetterstrm stood when he lost faith in love - - reality suddenly cracks and people must flee, as the area changes. In a matter of 24 hours, an otherwise normal part of Copenhagen - - has become its own city in the city. A city that people soon dubbed "The Zone". Established science tries to explain what happened and why - - but cannot come up with a satisfying answer. The only thing agreed upon is that the Zone is in Copenhagen. It's bounded by an invisible wall of an unknown substance - - and it measures exactly 372 x 88 metres. No one can visit the place anymore. It's closed to the outside world. Life goes on, and the Zone becomes an integrated part of Copenhagen. Of course there are rumours about what goes on in there. Some say that everything is in ruins - - but others claim that it contains the dreams of the world. But it's all rumours. The truth is known to nobody. Except to me, of course. Now we are here, then. It's been ten years since Andrea left Zetterstrm. He's here in New York at a safe distance of the Zone - - and his forgotten past. He is very successful. Not as a human, but as a pianist. Yes, well, I'm the expert. I'm Professor Fromberg. I've been asked to make a statement on Mr. Zetterstrm. But Mr. Zetterstrm prefers not to be seen when playing. If this is a modern publicity stunt, I don't know. But I've been told it hasn't always been like this. He is great pianist. Outstanding. No doubt about that. Technically speaking... But where is his passion? Fromberg is a wise man. He can hear something is wrong - - but he doesn't know what it is. I do. My mission is to make Zetterstrm see what he refuses to see. To remember what was concealed in the night. It won't be easy, but I'll manage. I have a plan, and everything has been prepared to the last detail. Let's get going. Zetterstrm has just finished a successful tour. Under the pretext of an interview - - our assistant will lure him to Copenhagen. The magical words to be said are simple: Your past has been kidnapped and is now in the Zone. Thanks for taking the time to see us. We are honoured. Thanks for taking the time to see us. We are honoured. You're welcome. You hide when you're playing. Do you have an aversion to being seen? No, it's not an aversion. My sole interest is music. The image of me playing diverges from the experience. I'm only a human. The music ought to be more than just me. Is that why all stage lights are turned off? And the audience has to be blindfolded with one of these? Any comments on that? I know it must be interesting to focus on something that appears eccentric - - but why don't we talk music? It's not that you're ashamed and want to hide? No. Could you tell us a bit about how you got started in music? - What do you mean, "started"? - When you started and why. Haven't you got any specific questions, or should I just jabber? When did you start playing the piano? - I don't think much of my childhood. - But what do you remember...? Nothing really. I think more of the future than the past. - You must remember something. - Of course I do. What? - What? - Yes, what do you remember? - Anything. - What's the meaning of this? Do you remember this woman? - Not off hand. - No? - No. What is this about? - She was your girlfriend. You lived together... It doesn't ring a bell? Forget it! I assume you can find your own way out. Do you know that your past has been kidnapped? - My past has been kidnapped? - Your recollections, your memories. They were stolen and placed in the Zone in Copenhagen, Denmark. - The country of your birth. - It's ridiculous! What do you want? Life as you know it began ten years ago. Everything before that is an impenetrable mist. - Let's be honest. Am I right? - No, you're not. Well, if you want to retrieve your past, you know where it is. Clara? Zetterstrm speaking. Zetterstrm... Were you asleep? What's the time at your end? That's early... Sorry. Listen, I think I'll accept the offer you mentioned. I know what I said before, but I changed my mind. I mean it. I'm coming to Denmark. I'll see you then. Sorry I woke you up. Take care... Bye. Zetterstrm has arrived in Denmark. The most important thing is neither the concert nor the people waiting - - but the invitation I sent him. He needs to read it as it will get him into the Zone. But first he has some questions, which is quite natural... I'm a little curious about the Zone. Where is it? It's right across from where you'll be playing. It's actually in the area where you used to live, isn't it? Right next to Gammel Strand. - And you can't enter? - No, it's completely sealed off. - Don't worry. It's quite safe. - Can you get me inside? You don't want to go in there. Do you? There's something I'd like to show you. Why are you sitting here? Maybe he isn't done with me yet? - Why is that? - I guess I'm not that easy to forget. No, you're not. But he managed to forget you anyway. He did forget you, didn't he? - I don't know. - Oh yes, you do. But don't you worry. We'll make him find you again - - and remember what you had together. Are you okay? Do you want to talk about it? - Do you regret we're together? - Why do you ask me that? Well, maybe you... Maybe I what? But it's not me... Is it my fault? I thought we agreed not to have the child. Am I wrong? I'm just upset. Is that alright? Of course it is. So am I. Hello. Terence Sander. Concert and museum manager. Hello... Terence Sander. Well, fantastic... Mr. Zetterstrm has arrived then. You both have... There's a letter for Mr. Zetterstrm. Important, I think... This way, please. This is our VIP entrance. - Shall I take this? - No, no... Is that the Zone? Yes. There you are! Zetterstrm, you are hereby invited to attend a dinner - - this evening at 7.15 p.m. At 21B Magstrde in the Zone. Entrance through K-Bar ladies' room, first cubicle - - in exactly 15 minutes from now. Exactly! And yes, we know when you're reading this, you're reading it now. PS: As the envelope says: This invitation is for one person only - - and that person is indisputably Zetterstrm, the pianist. Kind regards, Tom. Mr. Zetterstrm, are you coming? I fought for the idea. Not only is it the perfect location and backdrop - - but what could be more fitting than Thorvaldsen's statues? His controlled passion, the quiet onlookers, or listeners - - to Mr. Zetterstrm's magical music. Don't you agree? Absolutely. We've followed your instructions in detail and came up with - - what we believe is a magnificent solution vis-a-vis the concert. The box screens Mr. Zetterstrm from all angles without affecting - - the musical experience in any way. Would you like to see it now? Or would you rather have a drink and meet everyone? - Meet whom? - Well, this is quite an event... So we've prepared a small reception where you can meet the patrons. - And you want me to do that now? - Well, they are waiting for us. - Zetterstrm! - It's mentioned in the programme. Zetterstrm! I've been dying to see you again. It must be more than 10 years ago. - So much has happened since then. - Yes. I've been abroad. I came to help out with an event - - relating to the history of the Zone. - Are you alright? - I'm fine. - You do remember me, don't you? - Of course. - You've forgotten me! - Not at all. - You don't know who I am. - No, not really. He's forgotten me completely. Simone. Simone. I hope you are well. I won't take more of your time. Good luck. Thank you. I'm really sorry about that. - Shall we? - Yes, follow me, please. - What time is it? - 6:50 p.m. Why? - Nothing. Would you excuse me? - Of course. We'll wait here. - Go ahead. I'll catch up. - No, we'll wait... Go ahead. I'll be with you in a while. We'll go, and Mr. Zetterstrm will be along shortly. Do you believe me when I say I love you? Do you believe I love you? I don't know. I don't think you're lying, but I just don't know. You make me very sad. I hope you know that. - Good evening. - Evening. Where do I find K-Bar? Do you know where K-Bar is? - There? - It's where he points the truncheon. May we help you? We're quite busy doing our round, as you can see. - So that's the Zone? - Right. - Why can't one go there? - Because it's not legal. It's illegal. The opposite of legal. I get that. But why is it physically impossible to go there? Because it's an image. You can't walk through an image. - But I'm looking right into it. - That's what I'm trying to say... Stay put, will you? Now look... See? My guess is that the whole place is in ruins. Interesting. How long has it been like that? A long time. Perhaps you'd be so kind as to... - That direction? - Yes. - Good evening. - The ladies' room, please. On your left. What the hell are you doing? - Excuse me? - What? Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. - This is a mistake... - No, wait! - What do you mean, a mistake? - Nothing. Excuse me... Have we met before? We weren't meant to meet each other. Not like this. Do we know each other? Come on, what's your name? Hi. - Sorry, where am I? - Restaurant "Thorvaldsen's House". - And where is that? - 34 Gammel Strand. And yes, you are in the area referred to as the Zone - - where infinity doesn't reach out into the universe, but into the self. Sorry, I didn't write that myself! Are you coming? The kitchen's closed. Thank you. It was a pleasure. Delicate hands... Hope you have a pleasant stay here. - Where are you going? - I've got an appointment. - Where should I go? - I don't know. - Sorry, but I'm late... - Where do I find Magstrde? It was over there yesterday. I don't know where it is today. It moves about a bit. Sorry. You never believe me. It's very frustrating. How can I teach you, if you don't believe me? The problem is not the mistakes, but how we solve them... One moment, please. Yes? Hello. Hello. I'm Zetterstrm. I see... Hello. I've received an invitation. Are you Tom? - Zetterstrm, you say...? - Yes. What? Is that tonight? I had completely forgotten. I've been looking forward to meeting you. - Yes. - Yes... Please come in. - Tom! In here! It's urgent! - Oh... excuse me. - What's so urgent? - Are you sure he deserves it? It's for his own sake. You know that. You made it! Good. I was afraid we'd have to eat on the landing. Let me introduce myself. I'm Tom. As I said, I'm Zetterstrm. Thanks for inviting me - - but I have to ask: To what do I owe the honour? Simply curiosity. That's all. What book is that? Do you know it? Is it any good? I don't know it. Look, it's about you! I'll have to read it one of these days - - although I haven't read a book for years. It's not personal enough for my taste. A little too superficial. With all these books you can't always have felt that way. Yes, books are our collective memory. Just a shame it's so boring. It's only exciting once you're mirrored in the text. I'm not into reading about myself. Who's the boy in the picture? Yes, who is he? Who is he? I don't know him, but I love the picture. Very evocative, isn't it? - Yes. Do you play yourself? - No, not at all. So it's not your musical curiosity you're trying to satisfy? You look bewildered. Is something puzzling you? I'm just curious about the Zone, about you... - And the woman on the invitation. - The woman? Is she pretty? Yes. This is her. Well, pretty may be too strong a word. But she resembles someone you know? There was a photo of a woman here. It wasn't a drawing. - Where is it? - I don't know. - I want to know who she is. - You've forgotten who she is? I don't know her. These are important people. Very important people. I hope you understand that my vanity is not at stake here. No, that disappeared a long time ago... No, it's Zetterstrm. And what about... One can't disappear just like that. In principle he can do as he likes, but I need to know what goes on. What if he injures his hands or something? Cheers! And welcome to the Zone. It's a great honour to be granted entry, you know. I'm aware that no one is supposed to live here. People say the place is uninhabitable. Really? But we are sitting here, aren't we? People are wrong. They often are. I'm interested in hearing more about this woman. I gather that, but I can't help you. It's up to you. - How do you mean? - If it's not up to me, it's up to you. - I'm sure the Zone will help you. - I don't need any help. You sent me an invitation with a photo of a woman... - You are a great artist, Zetterstrm. - That's not the issue. - There's a picture of a woman... - Your music has changed, hasn't it? Is that why you invited me? To discuss my playing? - Not really. - What is it, then? Maybe the Zone can expand your horizon - - and elucidate your consciousness. Maybe you'll discover things you had forgotten. That's all. This is just a modest lunch with cracklings. - Is the Zone related to my past? - Related? Not romantically, no. Forgive me, but I know very little about this place. Ask as much as you want. Is it possible that my past is here somehow? Is that possible at all? In principle, yes. But we're dealing with a very big principle here. However, I'm sure the Zone can help you. Right. - It will have to be another time. - There is no other time. It's now, if you want to experience this unique place. Too bad. I have to go. You'll find many interesting things here. - Sorry. - Wait! Zetterstrm...! This is all wrong. Come back, please... Dammit! - What is it you want to show me? - You have to experience it yourself. - Tell me what it is! - I just want to show you the Zone. Show me what it is, then. And hurry! Of course... It's a small place. You'll make it in time. I hope you enjoyed the lunch. - What's happening? - I have no idea. Let's take a look. Do take a seat. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Just fine... - You're sure I can't tempt you. - Quite sure. I've got water as well, if you prefer that. - What kind of game is this? - It's not a game. It's the Zone. What does it mean? What was that I just saw? An inexplicable incident. Fascinating, wasn't it? So it doesn't mean anything? It has got nothing to do with me? Mean... What does a sunset mean? A beautiful flower? - They are, that's all. - They weren't real people? Of course. You saw them yourself. But they don't exist? Are they there now? They are only fictions. Fictions? I wouldn't say that... You can't see the canal from here. You sent me an invitation with a photo of a woman. Why won't you tell me who she is? And why can't I meet her? - It's time for you to get back now. - I think I know her. Is that possible? I'm not your therapist, fascinating as it might be. - It's not my area of expertise. - Why can't I remember her? I'm sure she's important, but I don't know why. Let's go. We must hurry... Stop! Wait a minute! I really think you ought to drink some water first. The Zone's strong stuff. You'll get a headache if you dehydrate. - I don't need any water. - Have some, anyway. - Where will I wake up? - Come on, it's only water. - It's only water? - Yes. Water. Let's go then. Hey...? Excuse me? Call off the search. Elvis is in the building. Well, he's almost there. You're coming now, right...? Are you finished soon? I'm finished now. - And it works? - It works. Good! - Are you sure you're okay? - Of course I am. I'll practise and then check out the piano. Is the stage ready? It's perfect. In spite of all, these people are okay. I'll practise, and then I'll be with you. Fine. The piano tuner will be here in fifteen minutes. I'm leaving... Hello? No, that's out of the question. He's practising. What's wrong with this? Mr. Zetterstrm, may I help you? - I'd like to try another piano? - Is something wrong...? It sounds odd. I'd like another one, please. Of course. This one should work. - I'd like to be alone. - Of course. An honour. Have you been playing? - This pile of shit is out of tune! - Let me check it... It needs tuning, but it's not too low. Try again, please. I don't get this at all... Is it mine? Finn speaking. Who...? Yes, he's right here. - It's for you. - For me? - Hello? - Hello. Zetterstrm? - Hello? - Hello. Zetterstrm? Tom speaking. Sorry to disturb you. You're probably busy. - That's right. - Well, you forgot something here. Or rather, my chef forgot to give it back to you. Rather embarrassing... I have a situation here. It'll have to wait. - But you can't play, dear friend. - What do you know about that? Don't look so sad. It'll all work out fine in the end... I'm right here! Sorry, I keep forgetting you can't see me. But I can see you. It all looks very nice. It'll be great when you can play again. But you have to come back and pick up your talent. Right? What? You have my talent? You've taken my ability to play? I can't play thanks to you? I'm so sorry. It's a mistake. My chef wanted to clean it to make it perfect for this evening. It was meant to be a surprise. I've got it right here. Well, in a small jar in my kitchen. In a jar? You sick fuck! Is that what this is all about? - Ruining me? - Absolutely not. On the contrary. You only have to pick it up, and everything will be great. Right? I see. How do I get across? Through K-Bar? Well, it's never as easy the second time. But listen... You'll find a small piano on Strget. Play for exactly two minutes. For two minutes exactly. Then you can enter through the nearest toilet. - You must be raving mad! - Manners, please! It's not that bad. - A little concert for the people... - But I cannot play! True, it won't sound beautiful, but it's only two minutes. - What do... - I must be off. I'll see you later. I'm not playing. Not a single note! Hello...? Fuck! I forgot something. It'll only take a second... What the hell is going on? You hear me? - Hello? Anyone home? - I hear you, dammit. You may catch your breath, and then off you go! Okay? Exciting, isn't it? Last minute preparations before the great event. - Where's Mr. Zetterstrm? - He was here a minute ago. He will be here for the concert, right? He does the playing himself, right? Well, you never know... - He's bloody strange! - That remark is totally unacceptable. You're right. Of course. Sorry! I'm sorry. - I don't handle pressure very well. - No, you don't. Damn! You fucking piss-ant! Damn you! Please take your boy. I need to play the piano. He'll be done in a moment. He's so fond of playing. - Get him off. I need the piano. - He'll lose interest in a minute. Take him! I need to use it now! It's very important. Come on, darling. That big, stupid man wants to play the piano. - Come on, get away... - Don't do that! Come, darling. - I'm sorry. - That's OK. You're going down. Excuse me? Yes? - I'm looking for Magstrde. - Sorry? I'm looking for Magstrde. It's supposed to be around here. I'm sorry, I don't understand. What are you saying? I'm trying to... Where do I find Magstrde? I don't... Magstrde. 21B Magstrde. - Oh, Magstrde! - Yes, goddammit! Magstrde! You're looking for Magstrde? Magstrde? - Magstrde. - Magstrde is right over there. - It's this way. - Where's Tom? This way, please. In here. Go to the top floor. - Get down. - Five more steps. Damn! You love me. Isn't that true? You know I do, but get down now. And I love you? - Is that a question? - Yes. Why are you doing this? - I want to know your thoughts. - You know them. No, I don't. I don't know what you think. I don't know what you feel. Do you believe me when I say I love you? I don't know. It's not that I think you're lying, but it's not the same as knowing. I don't know. - Fascinating, isn't it? - What the hell's going on? A little incident. That was me. What's going on? Stop this, and tell me what's going on. - A little incident. - Stop bullshitting me! What is it you want? This whole place has got to do with me. It's all related to my past, which you have taken from me. Yes, it may seem so, but it need not be the whole truth. The truth is that I know nothing thanks to you and the Zone. You're making progress. You know you don't know everything you should. Or "remember" might be closer to the truth. Impressive, isn't it? Why the hell are you doing this? Zetterstrm, you're right. Your past is here, but you never used it. We haven't robbed you of anything, but why should it go to waste? Your memories are fully functionable, but you had no use for them. I don't need your explanations! I want my memories back. - You want them back? - Yes! I want them back. I'm a pianist. It's my life, for God's sake. You can start by giving me back my ability to play... from that jar. - Jar? - Yes! And I want it now! - Yes... I see. - Stop that...! I've got a concert in 30 minutes, and I want it now! You mean fucking spastic! - I dare say... - Is that what you need...? - Zetterstrm, really... - What have I done? You're on your way. Towards the goal! Proceed straight ahead. Down to the mirror, and it's the door on your right. If you think you've broken me, you're wrong. It takes a lot more. - I just want what is mine. - I'm afraid you must take it yourself. How? How often do you get a second chance in life? Rarely or never. But you're getting one now. I think it's time you straighten out your life, Mr. Zetterstrm. The clock's ticking... even in here. Hello. - How do I get to the canal? - You want to go there? It's far. Far? But there are only three streets in this fucking... Sorry. - How do I get to the canal? - Through the back door, I suggest. - And then what? Where will I be? - Here. And you are going there. Have you learned to accept your mistakes, little Zetterstrm? - Not really. - You must learn to trust others. Trust me to send you in the right direction and not out of the Zone. Well? What will you do? You're okay. I love you. And I love you. Do you know that? I do. It just took me a while to know. A long time. Too long. I'm sorry. That's okay... That's okay. Come on... What the hell's going on? Where am I? - Right here. - But Andrea... - Forget it, old boy. She's gone. - No, she's here. - So you know who she is? - Of course I know who she is. Good. That was that, then. - Bring her back here. - I can't. Anything's possible here. Bring her back! I really can't. What you saw was your memory. You've got it back. - She's in there. - Bring her back! But she's not here. Surely you can understand that. - But what now... now that I regret? - It's a bit late for that, I'm afraid. So what do I do now? Well, you can go back to your music, if that's what you want. Take care. Play well. There he goes, our little Zetterstrm. Should we pity him? I'm probably not the right person to answer that. I don't think we can afford to forget. But maybe that's just me. But it hasn't been totally wasted on Zetterstrm - - for in a moment he'll be playing the most beautiful concert in his career. All screens are taken down, and his music attaches feelings - - to what many people perceived as cold and impersonal: Our very own Zone. For that we thank you, Zetterstrm. That was all. Good night.
