This is the third boatload of illegal immigrants. ...to land in Wakasa Bay in 6 months. Tokyo Shinjuku District. I'll take you to a nice restaurant. No, it's OK, maybe next time... Come on, it's OK... No... You're so rich and still you haggle... Stop, don't run! You can't escape. Where do you think you're going? Oh no... Let go, let me go! Let go! Stop resisting! Let me go! Northeastern China. Hey, little brother-in-law Hi. Can I get through? Yes. Don't fool me. I'm not, it's frozen solid! You little rascal. Who's your brother-in-law? My sister hasn't said yes to you yet! Let's go, let's go... Where are you running off to? My tractor's been destroyed by you! That's the one. No way, just from this scar. You can prove my wife is a Japanese orphan? What do you know? Those days, getting cowpox vaccination was a big deal. Only the Japanese children could afford such luxury. You're great Auntie. Just go along with it. ...and say they are your children. Then they can claim to be descendants of Japanese orphans. And go to Japan legally. Goodness, that's not possible. It would be illegal Yes. It can work! It can work? Oh, no way. Look, I can't have given birth to so many! It's not like making buns you know! Sure you can! Auntie Liu next door has 12! Please auntie, say we are yours! Let us have the chance to go! Yes, give us a chance... Steelhead. Are you romancing me, or that machine? Come up. Come up. My aunt in Tokyo wants me to go over. Should I? Will you come back? Why wouldn't I? You're worried I won't be back? Can't bear to see me go? Shameless! If you don't want me to... Follow your dream! Once I make enough money, I'll be back. Mail's here. No need to look, nothing for you. It's connected. Thanks. Jie, have you found her? No, she has moved. How can she just vanish? That's the thing. What about her aunt? She died last month. Died? How did she die? We are at the scene of the shipwreck. People of different nationalities are being taken away by the police. That's it, he must have been caught. Another one, poor sod. Jie, I've walked for two days. Thank God, I thought you didn't make it. Come on in. Some tea, hurry. Let me introduce you. This is my brother from home, Steelhead. This is Lao Gwei, Dai. That's Auntie Hao and her daughter Mae. Also just arrived. Now helping us to clean and cook. Hu and Fang. I said slow down... Slower. Don't choke. God, he stinks. When he's eaten, take him for a bath. You have to hurry, we're closing soon. Understood. Come. I'm surprised they have bathhouses here, just like home. This is the old area, some houses don't even have toilets. Idiots! Shut up! So sorry. Japanese mobsters, stay away. Why are there so many louts here? Tokyo has really gone to the dogs. That's right! Ain't that the truth! Damn it, if they had balls come to China. See if I don't chop him into pieces. How is life? Fine, just tiring. She moved away. After her aunt died. I've looked everywhere. You should give up. We'll talk after you get some rest. Come on, get up Coming. Move faster, or you won't get work. Takadanobaba. How've you been? Same as before. Is there any work? I don't understand English. Big brother... Wait. Any work? You're lucky, a foundation job. Guaranteed a week, 6,000 yen a day. Great! Can my two buddies go with me? Sure. But, 6 times 7 is 42,000 First, fork over commission of 4,200 each. Sure, sure, no problem... Go on then. Plastics with plastics, glass with glass. Separate the flammable from the inflammable. Don't be lazy! Damn it, I thought it was foundation work. Isn't all the land here foundation? In 20 years, this'll all be full of villas. Stop talking and get to work! Separate them properly! Plastics with plastics! What's that guy doing? Treasure hunting! Treasure hunting? Hey, hey... That's mine! The crane! Hey! Stop! You're crushing him! Hey! Someone's trapped underneath. Quick, call the police! They're calling the cops! Illegal workers better run! There's still someone there! Run! Run! Hurry up and help! Come on! Run! They're calling the cops! Thanks. Run! Run! Brother Steelhead, eat while it's hot. I'm Hong Kong Boy. You saved my life, I'll repay you 10 times. I have a plumbing job in a few days. Make sure you keep your word. A little token, please take it. Telephone cards. No, I can't. It's nothing. How do you sell these? Very cheaply, at a tenth of the price. Get me 20 of those. No problem, coming right up. They're fake! You have to use them at green pay phones. The red ones have a detection system. Never use those. How are you, big brother? Fine. Brother Tai Bo, please give me another 20 cards. Is 20 enough? It's for a friend. Look at you, didn't I ask you to work with me? There's a lot going on here! You can get anything you want! We are now at the Sanwa-kai headquarters... ...for the funeral of Mr Iwaida Jiro. All major mob heads are here. Police are being very cautious... ...and have sent a large contingent. We also hear from a reliable source... ...that the mob leaders will... ...sit down and elect... ...a new head for Sanwa-kai today. Excuse me. Togawa Taro, 2 votes. Muranishi Koichi, 5 votes. Muranishi Koichi is the new leader. The new leader is here! Boss... Boss... Our new leader, Muranishi Koichi. Sub-head, Eguchi Toshinari Enter. Kurata. Do you know what I do? I'm a police officer. You ask me to crawl down a sewer? Don't you know Iwaida Jiro is dead? I haven't even had time to celebrate... ...and you want me to do this? We received a citizen's complaint. Then you should tell them. It's the illegal workers who clean the sewers. A Japanese would never do such a dirty job. If his toilet was blocked. Shit would just pile up to his ass. OK, all right. After this, I'll buy you some drinks Lead the way. The number of illegals has gone up in the past 2 months. The brass needs to clean things up. He's the Chinese interpreter. I see. I studied some Chinese in college. But I'm not fluent. Can you understand me? I can follow you. Because I'm also Japanese. Oh... He really does understand me? Forget it. Watch your step. OK Stay where you are! Cops! Steelhead, run! Go! Cops! Run! Don't run! Stop! Round them up for questioning. Show your ID Take out your IDs. Keep quiet! Can you speak Putonghua? Speak it! What's happening? I can't understand them. Aren't you the interpreter? They are speaking in dialect. Besides Beijingnese, Cantonese, what else is there? Several hundred others! Oh really? How much do you earn a day? He said only 8,000 What's your point? This kind of work pays at least 15,000 yen. It's too little. Is my Chinese OK? Can you understand me? Yes I can. Get them out of here. Don't arrest me, please. Run! Run! No running! Stay where you are! Watch out! Over there! Help... I can't swim. Give me your hand. Steelhead, run! Hurry! Don't run. Wait. Run. Doesn't anyone guard the place? The Japanese don't steal, so they think others won't. Fools! Come, take this. This is worth nothing, get the LVs. ...and the Guccis. They're at department stores. Steal these, they're the hottest. I'll give you 20 percent of the market price. All these are stolen goods. The Southeast Asian buyers. All come here to buy. Some customers order in advance too. The harder it is to steal, the higher the price. Come, freshly grilled. Have it while it's hot So slow! I'll tell you who they are. The crew cut is from Vietnam. The effeminate one behind you is from Shanghai. Those on the other side... The loud ones. ...are from Fujian. The people here... ...are capable of doing anything. Do they work with each other? They're all in different gangs, so probably not. Don't listen to him. This year, everyone is under the same sky. Money is king! No money, no brethren. Get lost if you have no money! Don't talk rubbish! Let me show you something. Come over, come on. You eat first... Come over. I'll show you a trick, just a slip of paper. You spend nothing, but you have cigarettes. And you have spare change. Steelhead. I see an aggressive streak in you. It'd be a waste if you don't take short cuts. I don't want to be deported. Deported... You scared? Stop the nonsense. Just ignore him. I'll bring you back. Come back and play again, right? I'll wait outside. Are you new? Get yourself some food. Lily Yes. Go. Be careful. I'm drunk, Lily takes care of me. If you get drunk, I'll take care of you. Give me your money. I have no money. Hand over your money! Let go... What are you doing? Mito-san. Let me go... What are you doing? You... what are you doing? Help! Help! Help! Help! Run! Help... Thank you... Thank you. Are you OK? Oh, it's you. I hit the jackpot today. Mito-san. Sister. Mito-san, your head is bleeding! Come and help. I'm pissed off. No, don't drink any more. Give me a drink! Sit down first... I can't calm down without booze. Wang, bring the first aid box Right away. Come... Sit. Here's the box. I don't know how to thank you. Money's the most practical, please take it. I still need to return this money to you. Thanks. I'm looking to hire someone. Why not come and help me? It's OK, I have work. Let me get you a drink. Wang, bring some food. What would you like? I'll go prepare it. Anything will do OK No need to be curious. They're all working students. I purposely opened this bar at a quiet location. I wanted to keep things simple. Kabuki-cho is too uncivilised. Zunaku is a hostess bar. It's yours? Yes! If you're lonely or troubled. Just come here for a drink. This place is meant to sooth sorrows. I envy her. I too would like a man to search the world for me. You don't have a man? No good man! Good men like good women. Wrong! Good men like bad women. So you're a bad woman looking for a good man. Right! You're so right! Ah, problems, everyone has their problems. Are you doing OK at work? I'm doing OK That's good. Don't rush yourself. When people are in a hurry, they stray from the path. What do you want? You're obstructing justice, you're under arrest. Reject the Anti-yakuza bill, protect our rights. Can you please elaborate on... ...how the Japanese mafia can co-exist with other legal organizations? They don't exactly co-exist. It is a long and complicated story. Can you give us a simplified explanation? It's rather difficult... Tell the branches to burn all papers. And cease operations Yes. No one is to use any violence. Don't give the cops any excuse to hold us. Understood. Move out! Yes! Hurry up! There's no time! Hurry! Sir, times have changed. Sanwa-kai cannot survive on old rules. We need radical changes. Togawa Taro from Togawa-gumi... ...will never accept your suggestion. Perhaps, but Togawa-gumi is pushing things. The cops will use this as an excuse to arrest us. We can't treat him as the enemy. We can't have Sanwa-kai in disarray. And we certainly cannot anger Togawa Taro. I understand. Welcome. Good evening, Eguchi-san. Please come in. Here you go. Who is that man? Big shots! Look, look. The one in red... ...is Gao, the Taiwan gang's leader. The fiercest in Shinjuku. I think the tall guy beside him. ...is probably a mobster. Jie, is that her? Surely not. Isn't it? Hey, what are you doing? Don't go. Nakajima, take the things in. I can take them. No need. Nakajima, do you need to move some stuff? Thank you. If it's not enough, there's more inside. Thank you. That man just now... ...seemed quite taken with you. He is from my village. Under the circumstances, I didn't dare greet him. I didn't want to embarrass you. Yuko. We've been together so long. Why would I discriminate against the Chinese? Some people discriminate against foreigners. I think that's too extreme, and naive. Don't you agree, Nakajima? Many Chinese have come to Kabuki-cho. They're creating a mess there. Actually, they are no different from us. Just trying to make a living. Do you know how many Chinese... ...helped to build Kabuki-cho after the war? Never mind. Yuko. If you meet your friends again. Just make contact with them. I won't mind. I've been keeping this for a special occasion. Tonight, it's bottoms up! Come! Ah... Enough, enough... What's up? Waiting is such torture. Now we have the answer, great! Come, let's paint the town! Good, paint the town! Stop! What are you doing? Don't run! Come down! Run! My papers! My papers! Squat down! I can't go back. Since I'm on the road of no return. I should make life better for myself. I'll make some money and make myself legal. I can't live in the shadows forever. You mean... You want to skirt the law? What do you think? My problem is I'm a coward. I just want a pushcart to sell Tianjin chestnuts. That's my biggest ambition. Every dream needs money. Excuse me, brother Tai Bo. My buddy Steelhead has a deal for you. Let's sit and chat. What's to talk? Can you move that much? I have people. Good! Just show me the money! Remember, it's 1,000 for 8 cards. If they bargain, just throw in a couple free. Phone cards... Phone cards... Phone cards... Phone cards... If you want to make more, sell fake cards! To pose as tourists, you must behave like them. What do you think? Beautiful? Remember, look for the expensive stuff! Hong Kong Boy, come over. This is good. Look at this, this one... it's good. PACHINKO I've secretly rigged this machine. I'll teach you a special way to play it. It will spit out tens of thousands of yen every day. It's steady income. We've to get 600,000 yen to go into business. Is it risky? Isn't being an illegal worker risky? Let's go for it, here's 30,000 I'm in! Here's my 30,000 Jie, go and change the presents OK Sorry... There's no problem. Let me do it. Calm down, why are you so flustered? Thanks. Have you seen this kind of card before? I think so. Sir, are you not well? I'm fine... I'm fine... Are you sure? Yes, I'm fine. Please wait Thank you. You can take a seat over there. It's fine... Really. Why are you so nervous? He's really unwell... Let it go. All right? Jie... Jie... Come here. What's going on? There's a delivery for you, go take a look. For me? What is it? OK... quiet down. Jie, we all discussed it. You're too timid for a life of crime. We pooled our money and got you a cart. You can sell your chestnuts. Work hard Go have a look. Tasty chestnuts, sweet and fragrant! Sweet and fragrant! You can only win if you love a good fight. Check it OK Is this what you wanted? Yes. OK, I'll keep this one. Looks great. Such a coincidence... Shopping? My day off today, just looking around. I've been doing this recently. This is for you. For real? Of course, it's for real. It's from Takashimaya. I mean are you really giving it to me? Oh... Boss, give me a bag. Thanks! Don't put it here, over there! Do you have it? Two twos, any takers? No Three fours. Quiet... quiet... Steelhead's brought a woman back. No way! And she's quite pretty. They're coming. It's very lively in here. Let me help you. Thank you. What? Seen a ghost? Yes, two in fact. A male and a female. You! Can't ever say anything nice! Let me introduce. She's Lily, a special friend of mine. How are you? Sister in law! That's Auntie Hao How do you do? Pleased to meet you. Miss Lily. You and Steelhead look like a couple! Auntie Hao, what are you saying... Attention! Marry now, bridal chamber next! The banquet comes tomorrow Hear, hear! You people are impossible. Making noise all day long. You've destroyed my perfectly good place. Get out, all of you, or I'll call the cops! Get out! What did he say? What did he say? He... He said you're rude and noisy. He wants you to go, or he'll call the cops. Move? Are you kidding... Lao Gwei It's new year and he wants me to move! Hush... I'm sorry. Please... What's this? Please. This won't work next time. Remember, sort the garbage! This is a broken shack, what's he so pissed off for? Don't you agree? What did he say? You must have got him in trouble... ...by not sorting the garbage. This place is a garbage dump! What do we need to sort? That's right! Hey! You can't blame him for being mad, it's his property. If we piss him off, he'll go to the cops. Who suffers? We do. Hey, we have to learn Japanese... ...if we want to blend into their world. We're living in their home, we should build links. We need to communicate more. You're right. Why don't I start a Japanese class. ...and teach you all for free? Fantastic, count me in OK! Me too... I want to as well... OK, no more talk. It's new year, time to eat! Yes, new year! Let's eat! Lao Gwei, speak softer. You're the loudest, tidy up! Why so late tonight? Business has been good. Really? Look. Let me show you some magic OK Which hand? This one. Nothing. That... That one. Also nothing. Where is it? Where is it? I think, it's in your ear... How can it be? Let me see. It's really there. Really How would I know? I'll give it to you OK Who are you? He's my father. How do you do? I'm also Chinese! It's the New Year. A gift from me. You're also Chinese? Come, have a cup of tea! Come... Sure... How about my cart? No worries! Go on home. Why? Just go. I told you to go home! Why? I said go! Go home! Dad... Who do you think you are? You dare touch my daughter?

Who is this Uncle Tak? An old China hand. He has yakuza support. We always try to avoid him. ...and try to ignore him. I told you to leave his daughter alone. Why didn't you listen? Where are your ears? Can you hear? He's taken my cart. Let's go. Get the cart back! Steelhead, don't mess with these people. He really has yakuza support. If we don't look after our brothers. Does that mean I should also look away... ...if any of you are in trouble in future? Those without balls can stay and eat! I'll be back. What do we do now? Steelhead... Steelhead. Which one? The one at the back. What are you up to? You don't understand? Are you a foreigner? You looking for trouble? Shouldn't be. Chinese are forbidden. You asshole. You want to die? What's going on?

Now you'll regret it! Jie. There's quite a few of you! You the leader then? Tell your people never to step foot in Shinjuku again. If I ever catch any of you again. I guarantee.

Let's go! Go, quickly! Perhaps... I should have killed him! Auntie Hao, the doctor is here. Quickly... Come in. The doctor is here. The doctor is here. This is unacceptable! We should go and teach Gao a lesson! Yes, we should chop off his hands! And scoop out his brains! Right? Chop them up. Let's go! Hey, what are you doing? You think he's stupid enough to sit and wait for us? Aren't we going to pay him back? You like talking about it? If you want, just do it, don't talk about it! Don't be impulsive, calm down. Let's think this through! What do we do? Jie, what do you want? Water? I want my hand. Give me my hand... I know you and Eguchi are tight. I know he'll come tonight. Togawa-san. Is the head of Togawa-gumi in agreement? Eguchi-san has been good to me. Gao-san, I represent my father today. You won't be disappointed. You mean, the offer... ...is something I can't refuse? My father said... ...if you kill Eguchi. He will give you Kabuki-cho. On opening night. Did you see Eguchi's wife? Yes, she's quite pretty. She's... Yuko, right? Her name is Xiu Xiu. She used to work as a hostess. She looks very Japanese! Boss, we're really going to do it? I've wanted to for a long time. Had I not played hard to get... ...that wily Togawa would not have agreed to my terms! Ask the Japanese staff to go home. Then get the place ready. Eguchi-san is here. Welcome Thank you. Business has been good this month. Especially at shop 2 It's up 20 percent from last month. See here. Faster than I expected. Yes. It should do even better next month. Yes. Grab him! Sorry, boss! I don't really want to kill you! Kill! Run! Kill him! Kill him! Run! Not here! Go! I... Have seen you before. Thank you. They're back... Step aside! Deputy chairman. I apologise for your fright! Darling. Are you all right? I'm fine. Your old friend saved me. I'm going to change, please attend to him. Are you hurt? No, it's nothing. Mum, is he your friend? This is my daughter, Ayako. Were you bitten by a mosquito? She looks like you. Steelhead. Don't think badly of me. Don't be silly. I was just a little worried. Now I feel better. You're doing all right. I am now called Eguchi Yuko. Don't worry, I understand. Ayako, come here. Thank him for me. He says thank you. Tell him that before Gao tried to kill him. A young man named Togawa came to see him. Before you arrived at the bar. A man called Togawa was there. Ask him what he's doing now? He wants to know what you are doing now? Just crappy jobs. Just small jobs here and there. If he is willing to help me. I will pay him well. However much he wants. He asks. If you'll work for him. He can pay you well. However much you want. Please tell him, it's all right. Please thank him. Go home and see your mother if you can. She cries every time she thinks of you. Can you believe the irony? Your ex saves your husband's life. I'm sorry. Branch leader Togawa Taro. ...actually asked an outsider to kill his sub-head. If we don't expel him. ...there will be unrest. Where's your proof? If you slander my father again, I'll kill you! What do you intend to do? Shut up! Any more and you will leave! Sanwa-kai's secret of survival... ...is unity! Whoever brings up the word "expel" again... ...won't get away with it. Eguchi. I can't see why Togawa would want to kill you. Do you? Eguchi has been eyeing Kansai. That's why I think the Osaka faction did it. Give me a little time to investigate. Go bow to Togawa-gumi's leader. Wipe out the past. Let's make a peaceful new start. Steelhead, how's he doing? Fever's not gone? No, a bit delirious. Maybe he's having nightmares. Steelhead. A Japanese guy to see you. This reminds me of home when I was a kid. Please sit down. Is this your girlfriend? I'm Lily. You are very fluent. Would you translate please? He wants me to translate. There's no need. I want you to get rid of two guys for me. Why me? I can't use my own men. Who are these two men? One is the head of Togawa-gumi. The other is the head of Sanwa-kai, Muranishi. OK, I'll do it. But you have to agree to all my terms. Firstly. You need to get me legal status in Japan. Then, you'll give me the Taiwan gang's territories! We not only have the same tastes. We also work the same way. Togawa-gumi is crazy! We can't sit around and do nothing! I'm going to kill you! Maruyama is dead! Attack with full force! Go! Recent attacks in Shinjuku... ...have been classified critical. Ordinary citizens are in danger. Togawa! To prevent things from going out of control. The area commanders will take control. Organised Crime Division. Eguchi Toshinari, head of the Eguchi clan... His follower Nakajima Hiromasa. And the late Muranishi Koichi... ...were close... That guy Tanaka... isn't he a political bigwig? What are they doing? Black gold politics has existed forever. Don't be naive. Gangs, yakuza, showbiz. You can't separate one from the other these days. It's called capitalism. The dead have no more value. But the riches in this world still do. Vengeance must be resolved. In-fighting must cease. Eguchi... ...is hereby appointed head of Sanwa-kai. Togawa Taro is dead. Kyohei is Togawa Taro's heir. He'll handle the same territories. I've asked two friends to be witnesses. Any opposition? Tanaka-san is elderly. Don't give him cause for worry. You'll follow his orders, right? We will watch over you. You catch my drift? Kitano-san, they're coming over. Why is he beside Eguchi? Kabuki-cho's merchant list. Give Shinjuku territories to Steelhead. Boss, that's not right. How can I explain it to our men? The Chinese cannot be trusted! He saved my life. What's wrong with giving Gao's territory to him? Letting the Chinese control the Chinese might work. More importantly. ...he will draw Togawa arrows like a bullseye. But, boss... Enough, just do as I say. I can't go against the boss' orders. But I want you to know. I, Nakajima Hiromasa, despise you people! Brothers, onward to Shinjuku! May wealth pour in. Brother Steelhead, congratulations. We old immigrants will count on you from now. Come... Come... Come... Let's have a drink, thanks... Steelhead-san. This gift is from the head of Eguchi clan. He wishes you prosperous business. Thank you. Here, take this inside. Is this protection fee? This stops from next month. But it's the tradition. Yes, yes! It's unfair to you all. We've all crossed the seas to get here. Making it alive wasn't easy. We should work together. How can I take advantage of my own people? Besides. In future, when my brothers do business in Kabuki-cho. Running a noodle shop or Chinese restaurant. They will still need your help. Then... What happens when there's trouble? What trouble? There are lots of drunken louts here. Can't you call the cops? No, they're always gang members. Our licenses will be affected if there's trouble. True? Right? Brother, Kabuki-cho lives by one law in the day. And another by night. If you don't take this money. It will incite more fights when others find out. I'll take it for now. We'll treat it as a loan. When I make a profit, I will return it. No... No need to return. You have your work cut out for you. For instance, improve the safety here. And don't let the young ones sell drugs. Thank you, big brother. Thank you... We'll take our leave. See you... Thank you, big brother... Thank you. Jie. You've finally made it. I hope you can forget the past. Jie... Jie, what are you doing? Let go... Jie... Jie, let go! How could you? Let's go... Let's go. Go quickly... Jie... Jie... Don't push me! Are you on his side or mine? Steelhead... Hey Jie, what are you doing? What? You want to hit me? Calm down. You can only win if you love a good fight. Come... Bottom's up. The old wine from home is still best. Ganbei! Steelhead. We wouldn't be here without you. What are you saying! Don't fight, let's drink to Steelhead! Steelhead, to you! We have achieved some results today. But we all know in our hearts. This was achieved through illegal means. We can't do that in the long-term. I opened this Kabushiki Gaisha. Because I wanted us to have a legal business. To run an entertainment club on the lowest rent. A licensed one, not illegal. And, to grab the control of the Taiwan gang. So that we can protect ourselves. We hear you, Steelhead. We'll follow your lead. We have all suffered. That's why I want to set aside some money. To help those who have just arrived. Help them find jobs. I want this responsibility to go to... How about to Jie? Everyone OK? Good! Then I would like to do something that interests me. In future, the business here will go to... ...it's yours, Hong Kong Boy. I'm not sure if I can. You'll have Tai Bo and Hu, they have experience. Try it out. Remember, be united! Jie, any problems? Thank you. Thank you, everyone. A toast to Steelhead, cheers! Come... Come, drink. Steelhead. We're tired, we're going to go. OK, go on then. Congratulations, you finally made it. What do you mean? I want to see if you are illegal. So you finally got it. You owe me one. I let you go once, the debt is paid. Just once? That's worth a life? Half the debt then? OK, half! I hope you can be a good man. Because I don't want to... ...come after you one day. That'd be just great! One, two, three. You have more grey hair. I'm forty something! Finding me old? In your heart. What's the most important thing in life? That's a loaded question. Man's most original wants... ...were for food and shelter. But when we see what we don't have... ...our desires grow. Xiu Xiu, what are you looking at? Why so many people? Look... There's a fridge, and a color TV Go back Let's just take a look. You'll break the windows! Go home! Let's go... Don't look, it's no big deal. Look at her! Let's go... Come on. I want to find a job out there one day. Don't go, you'll never come back. Why do you say that? Because the city is vibrant. It's colorful, and different from here. If you go, you won't want to return. You're wrong Are you sure? You're wrong I'm dead right. Since becoming a wife and mother. I know what I value in life. You have to learn to be content. When people have been oppressed... ...or when they have certain demands. When they have established a force. That force evolves into power. Mobs have historically been formed like this. Unfortunately, power changes people. From passive and tolerant, they begin to get aggressive. They lose control of themselves. More than 1.5m foreigners living in Japan. What a broken and dirty place! How can anyone live here? What are you saying? I used to live here! It's smelly! Wasn't this cooked by my mother? She's been dead so many years, and it's still here! Damn it. Where's that bastard Tai Bo? Here, here. Why's the place so run down? Stop shouting. We're businessmen now. Cut the crap! Where's the stuff? Come, have a look. One kilo, the money? You only deliver once a week. How am I going to make money? Cops have been clamping down, there's not enough goods. Just add some ketamine, you'll be high in no time. Shizuko, I just bought a convertible. I want to take you for a spin. I'm busy. Is it because of this? I've already gone for laser treatments. It will disappear soon. I guarantee it will disappear! What's going on? It's... A friend. Friend? When did I become a friend? If we're friends, how come you can't even look at me? What's your problem? What are you looking at? It's very cute. Stop, don't hit him! What? What's up? Don't aggravate him. Go in for a drink, OK? Let's all go in! What are you guys up to? How can you let foreigners trample all over your turf? Eguchi brought them in. Why didn't you question Eguchi? He's the boss. I have no such right. Eguchi, let me ask you something. Master, what's the matter? Who are those Chinese people? It's better if they take care of certain things. It's OK to use them. But you can't let them build up power. They're just our chess pieces. It's OK to have chess pieces. You can't let your own people suffer. I will be honest with you. That's my plan exactly. I want to use them to take care of Kyohei. Master. I think Sanwa-kai needs to re-organise. About that... Let's talk later. Don't be too conspicuous, understand? Definitely, sorry to trouble you! Damn it! Ruled by ambition. Time to let him go. Can you do it? Come in! Kitano-san. Have some tea. Very fragrant. It's the best oolong tea. Hard to believe that. So much success in so short a time. It's just a small business. This is not small. Roppongi, Aoyama and Shibuya, all yours now. It's not small! These are papers on Toka Shouji Trading Company. Police already ID-ed you as Katou-gumi. The biggest foreign gang in Japan. You must be mistaken. You even dare sell drugs. If you have proof, arrest me. What are you trying to say? Your men must be hiding things from you. Secretly working with Eguchi. Who's working with Eguchi? It's your buddy Jie. If it is him, I will stop him. Don't delay. But I have a request. You're in no position to ask. Don't arrest my people. Impossible! Cops arrest crooks, that's the game. But... If you find evidence incriminating Eguchi. I can help with certain things. Steelhead. I've wanted to ask you. Muranishi Koichi, Togawa Taro. Did you kill them? You speak out of turn! Steelhead, ignore him. No matter what, I need time. Steelhead. I have repaid my debt in full. Big brother. Where's Hong Kong Boy? He's just gone out, back soon. My number will win. I've won! You lucky bastard. There are guests here, keep it down. He told you to pipe down. He's talking to you. What are you saying? Shut up. You looking for trouble? Where are you from? We're Katou-gumi. Let me teach you a lesson. Punch him! Let go... Let go! Let go! Do you want to die? You dare hit big brother? Do you know who he is? Brother Steelhead! Are you OK? Who are they? Jie's followers. They just arrived, they're ignorant. It's a mess. You again? Goldie! Is that you? Always making trouble! Apologise! Apologise now! Sorry, big brother! Go! Run! How did Eguchi look for Jie? He has a lot of men. You told him to take care of the new ones. Are we a triad gang now? It's for survival, don't interfere. When I came over. Most of the people got caught. You were lucky. Perhaps. Steelhead. Why don't we leave Japan? To go where? I have a good friend in Brazil. What language do they speak there? I think it's Portuguese. What can I do there? Something that lets you sleep at night. I can't leave them behind. Don't be naive. Life is one big mistake. How many can you help? Or save? You can't do anything. Why have you called me here? I don't look after domestic disturbances! As long as you don't arrest my people. I will turn evidence against Eguchi. Eguchi asked me to kill Muranishi and Togawa. Steelhead... what are you doing? Have you gone mad? Are they worth it? Are they worth this? It's all lies. Pay him no heed. He's only trying to save his brothers. He's lying to you! He's lying! What are you trying to do? Do you want Eguchi go to jail. So Xiu Xiu will come back to you? Have you ever considered my feelings? You are so selfish! Steelhead. Let's just leave, OK? Lily, I can't live in regret. Who do you live for? Your brothers? Your ex-girlfriend? Or for me? She seems to have fallen for you. If I were her. I'd kill you. Gao, if you want back Kabuki-cho. You'll have to rely on yourself. Yes! Kill Kyohei and Tanaka for me. What do I get? All the Chinese territories go to you. Eguchi-san. Your men have all betrayed you. Now is the time for us to use the Bushido way. To get rid of the Chinese pigs! Aren't we here for war? What are we waiting for? Shut up and sit down and eat. They're talking upstairs. What if they don't listen to you? Then send them all back to China. They have legal documents. Let's play it by ear! Aren't you afraid I'll run? It's a lifelong job going after guys like you. Steelhead. What are you doing? Isn't he a cop? The cops know you are a criminal outfit. What's this you and us stuff? Aren't we one family? Chairman Eguchi. I was just looking for you! Why are you in cahoots with him? Be clear in what you say. You worked with him first. What about you? When did you join the cops? How could you deal drugs? Don't just pick on me. Could I have done all this alone? All of you are in this? No... Not me. They said they wanted to. If you did it, then own up! Hey, you didn't want to run things. You just upped and left. Now, you lecture us? Can you hear yourself? Stop squabbling. Ingrate! Don't talk to me! Tai Bo... Stop quarrelling. Lao Gwei! Why are you speaking for him? We're only making some money, what's the big deal? We didn't sell to the Chinese. Steelhead. Since we all agreed to it. Keep out of it. The cops want to catch someone, who? Me! What have you turned into? Especially you. Look at you! You look like a ghost, you know that? Ghost? If there is one, you let it out. You're the real ghost! Wake up! Steelhead, you've done all you can. Leave it for now. You can't leave! Don't let them leave Get away... You can't leave... Get away! You know the repercussions of attacking a cop? We're family, stop fighting. Are you crazy? You treat the cops as family? If you follow him, it's a dead end! You are the one heading for a dead end. You've forgotten you killed someone? I killed. I did it for you! Stop bullshitting! You killed the border guard so you could see your woman. You killed the yakuza because you wanted legal status. For the money, for yourself! So what if I did? Didn't you get something too? Didn't all of you get something? All you have today, who fought for it? Without me, where would you be? You really want to talk like that? When you first came to Japan. Who looked out for you? Without me, you'd be eating turd! Didn't I risk my life too? Steelhead, you're wrong to say that. What? Want to take me on? The matter wouldn't end there. The Japanese won't let you go. He won't let the Chinese take power. He'll destroy you sooner or later! Kitano-san has already said. ...he only wants Eguchi. If you stop your activities. He'll let you go. Don't fall for it. If I fall, you all fall. Get them! Don't move! Kitano-san. Get away! Wait. Calm down, Steelhead. Go back with me. Jie. Just kill me. Jie. Shoot! Don't do this! Jie. Go away. Have you gone mad? A knife? This is not child's play. We can talk about anything. And come to an agreement. Chinese don't fight Chinese... Breaking my winning streak. You want my life? What do you expect from me? Go up! Come! Hong Kong Boy. Check on Lao Gwei, hurry. Help him. Let's get upstairs. Jie, no. Jie. Don't leave. You're all dead! Hey, come out! Go up! Go! Steelhead. Get away! Don't... Don't... Go. Fang, help! Jie, run. Run, run! No, Eguchi. Eguchi. Kobayashi, it's me. Bring men down to Toka Shouji. Quickly! I can't believe Nakajima sold me out. This is for you. All the information is in there. Your cop friend can get a promotion. I think... I could have gone out with a bigger bang. Eguchi. Nakajima, Eguchi is dead. He said, he'll come back as a ghost to haunt you. Give me the knife! Don't let him go. Steelhead! Dai! Dai! Dai! Go! Steelhead, here. There are stairs outside. Kitano, are you OK? Open fire if they resist, let's go! Don't run! Steelhead. It seems. I'm still a coward. Stop doing this, Jie! Xiu Xiu, is that you? What's happened? Stay calm. Eguchi is dead. Quickly pack and find a safe hideaway. How about this? Bring your daughter. To the Okubo station, I'll wait for you. Hurry! Well? Speak up! Tell us! You'll regret not talking. Your kid will die. Speak! Ayako. Don't... Ayako... What happened? The cops are here. Go to Okubo station now. Take care of Steelhead! Where are you? Okubo station. I'm on my way. Get me a car. Over there. There. Are you OK? Don't shoot! Nakajima! Hold your fire. Stop, don't shoot! Emergency! Officer down! How many men are down? Get an ambulance here... Steelhead! Steelhead! Steelhead! Steelhead! Hang on! Your lung must be punctured! It's no use. I have repaid my debt. Steelhead! We can call it even. What did you say? Steelhead, what did you say? The rest is a battle. You can only win if you love a good fight.
