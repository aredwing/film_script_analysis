Throw the gun down! Drop the gun! Stop screaming. Put it down! Shit. Enough! Don't move! Who are you? Why did you attack me? Are you hurt? No. - Do you know where we are? - No. Is that the only word you know in English? I was born in New Jersey. You got any idea how you got here? - No. I just woke up. - You just woke up? You just woke up, you decided to kill me? Well, I didn't know who you were. What's your name? - Jin. - Jin? Jin, I'm David. I let you up, Jin... are you gonna be cool? What is this place? I don't know. Last thing I remember, I was... I was walking down Beacon Street. I live in Boston. I was in New York. I don't think we're in any of those two places right now. I don't think so. This metalwork, it looks like... 6th century. You get a brochure on the way in? I was gonna be an architect. Where'd you learn how to fight like that? From the movies. My daughters say the same thing... - about cuss words. - Shh. Are you hearing that? I think I know what this place is. It's an incinerator. Do you think-- do you think it's gonna ignite? I don't know, but I don't wanna stick around and find out. Do you? Are we in a dungeon or something? I don't suppose that means we're anywhere near an exit. No. I mean, who does this? Huh? You sure you don't know who might've done this? No. You lying to me, Jin? Hey, don't bullshit me! This is not a fucking game here! You know something, spit it out! You have any enemies? Anyone who would've done this to you? There were these men. They came in one night, I was closing. Robbed me. That wasn't the first time. Gave me no choice, you know? I mean, a man's gotta protect his-- his property, right? I don't think they were even gonna do anything that night. It didn't matter, because I was gonna do something. I've been trying to forget that night ever since. If anyone's done this to me, it's their friends. - How long ago was this? - I don't know. It's-- it's hard to say. A couple of weeks, maybe. Whether or not these thugs did this to you, we gotta get out. I don't know, Jin. I think we can rule out the Jersey gangbangers as possible masterminds on this. Yeah, I think so, too. - Think it's government? - No. Only government builds something this ugly. It ain't the government. How old are your girls? 10 and 11. Michelle and Anna. They play for my wife and I every Tuesday night. The best concerts I've ever been to. What about you? What do you do? I was a cop. I don't think... we're alone. Jin. J-- Just put the sword down. Don't shoot. We don't know anything. Jesus. You're a kid. Back off or I cut him. You hurt him and I bust up your boyfriend! I'm not her boyfriend, asshole. I'm glad we cleared that up. Now drop the knife. - Drop the sword. - You first. - Fuck off! - It's gonna be like that? Every step. It's your turn. Now Why'd you attack us? Look at you guys. You look like the fucking cleanup crew. What the hell are you two doing down here? We're on our dream vacation. How the fuck am I supposed to know - what we're doing down here? - A real smartass, aren't you? Tyler, come here. Get over here. - You okay, kid? - I'm fine. When you bleed to death in two hours? Come here. - So what are you, a doctor? - Boy Scout. It's not perfect, but it'll stop the bleeding. My name's Tyler. David. This is Jin. She's Emma. Well, where are you headed? We don't know. Figure there's a way in, there's gotta be a way out. Yeah, okay. Guess we'll see you around. Take care of your leg, kid. Okay, guys, look, just wait, all right? We're down here alone, okay? We have no idea where we are, we're just as lost as you, okay? We just wanna get the hell out of here. What about you? Just don't slow us down. - Where'd you meet the kid? - In a pile of corpses. Jesus Christ. They're not fucking around, are they? Never thought they were. Who would do something like this? You think they beat her to death? That chain on her neck-- it's direct pressure on the carotid, it sends the heart into cardiac arrest. - They gonna kill us too? - No. It's not gonna happen. This wheel mechanism is connected to these chains, to the ceiling. But it looks like if you turn it, it can tighten or loosen. Now why, I have no idea. What do you think all these symbols mean? They're signs of the devil's students. This place has been consecrated for unholy teaching. That's what they teach you in Catholic school these days. There's some writing here. "Welcome to the end of your lives. For once you have survived these halls, you will no longer be who you once were. You have begun the first of four levels of the gauntlet." "Each has a test and a choice. Like Gideon's escape... there is one exit, and one way of opening it. Begin." What the hell is that supposed to mean? - Great, Emma, what'd you do? - I didn't do anything. Fuck. What the fuck is going on?! Why are you doing this? What, is this some rich bastard's idea of entertainment? - It's a science experiment. - We are gonna die down here - without any food and water. - Look, it doesn't matter! All that matters is getting out of here. It's a game. They want us to play their game, that's what we're gonna do. I just want a smoke. What do you think this is? I think it's a blood trough. A what? It needs blood to work. You sacrifice someone, blood drips into these grooves, turns the trough. - Jesus. - Hey, guys. Come take a look at this. Any guesses? That's 6-6-6. That's a satanic code right? Nothing. Just about a million different possibilities. What is that? I don't know. Father? I won't forget. 7-10-7. What? 7-10-7. What is that, your old locker combination? It's the number of the dragon. The devil. Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Shit! Fuck! Oh shit. Wait, all right. Stay still, Jin. I got you. I'm gonna lift you. All right, it's moving. It's moving. All right, put your weight on me. Tyler, I need you. Tyler, I need your help. We gotta take the pressure off his leg. Come here. - No! - Get your ass over here! I need you! - Come on, move it! - Help me! Stay with me, man, okay? Put your arm around him. He's gonna lean on you, all right? Okay, don't let him fall over, okay? Hang in there, Jin. What's your wife's name? - What's her name? - What? What's her name? What's your wife's name? What's her name? - Megan. - Megan? Just think about Megan, okay? And think about your two beautiful girls, all right? - All right. Tyler, you got him? - I got him. Okay. Emma! I need your help. - We gotta do this. - What? - You gotta help me. - You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Look, Jin is gonna bleed to death if we don't help him. - Now help me. - I'm-- I'm not gonna bleed a dead body. Look, I don't want to do it either. I know you don't give a shit about Jin, but I do. - Now help me. - This is so fucked up. If you wanna save your own ass and get outta here... help me. On three. One, two, three. Push. Push. Stop. Stop. Push it the other way. Spin it the other way. Spin it. Damn it! We killed her. Did you hear me? We fucking killed her. They set us up. Why would they set us up to do this? David, please. Come on. Push. Hold him still. Now this is gonna hurt. Come on. - Who are you? - Please don't hurt me. - You a part of this? - No, I'm not. - I need help. - How'd you get in here? I don't remember. I was thrown in a van and... there were other voices. They were almost chanting. Then everything went dark. Then... then I found myself here. How many people are in this thing? Yeah, and where are they now? Look at you. You're covered in blood. Obviously, it's not yours. They tried to kill me. They went crazy. Look at that girl. They hung her up... in the chains. And I was lucky to escape before they got to me. I don't buy it, David. She needs help. Leave her, man. Fair enough. You can come, but you stay in front. What do you want us to do? You want us to leave her behind? How do you know that she didn't spring that trap? And now Jin is probably gonna die - because of-- - Shh. Whatever. Doesn't look good, man. You gonna be all right? I might lose a leg, but other than that I'm okay. I just wanted to say if you need help with your leg... I can help you out walking the rest of the way. All right. I see you got some ink there. You a big drinker or those actually mean something? You don't have to pretend that you give a shit about me. Really. I mean, we're all stuck down here. You think we can play on the same team? My battle scars. What, you don't got any? - Not a scratch. - Oh yeah, you're so full of shit. A girl, right? - Me? - Mm-hmm. Oh, that's right. You went to Catholic school. I forgot. I bet you weren't there by choice. I didn't really choose much of anything in my life. To be honest with you, sometimes I wish I could just... start over as somebody else. My father's voice is what haunts me, if you're really asking. When's the last time you saw him? When I was eight or maybe nine. Dropped me off at the runaway shelter... then he walked away. That was it. Oh. Smells awful. Oh fuck. You've gotta be kidding. Let's keep moving. Let's go. This can't be the right way. I don't think we have a lot of options here, guys. How can you walk through that dead water? Look, it's either we go this way or we go back the way we came. What if you're wrong? Then we're wrong. Come on, let's go. You can relax. He's all right. It looks like he knows where we're going. Well, he doesn't. We're just as lost as you are. Look... my father has a lot of money. If you were to rescue me, he would reward you. Is there anything-- anything- that I can do to make you remember how to get out? No. There isn't. You sure I can't drink this water? Yeah, I'm sure. I don't think we're gonna get out of here. I'll fucking kill you. Give me the... Okay okay. - What is it? - Huh? David. Yeah. What do you got? Come here. Take a look at this. Okay, you remember in the altar room the stone that had the combination dials on it. It was much bigger and larger than the others around it. - Okay. - Okay, now we've searched every inch of the walls here and there are no dials for this level. - Yeah, saying there are some. - You see, I think it's on the floor, which would be impossible to find, but if you look at the ceiling... every tenth stone is wider and larger. It's part of the design. - You said the floor. - You see, the early stoneworkers had different grooves for the ceiling and the floor. And in order to solve the debate, they decided to mirror the ceiling to the floor. Okay, so we search every tenth stone for the dials. Right, but only in the center line. Okay, let's get to work. Oh! Kim, who is that? Uh... I don't know. Is he one of the people you were with? No. I-I-- I don't know. Is he one of the people you were with?! You know what? She's been shady since the moment we met her. Let's just ditch her and get the fuck out of here! Kim, you gotta come clean with us, okay? I'm s-- I'm sorry. Let's get outta here. Please. Please. You won't understand. Try us. There was this man. His ugly fat ass. He was the most disgusting freak I've ever seen in my life. Every girl's nightmare. He showed up to my class every night. When I ask him to leave, he wouldn't listen. Hey! Go! Go! Eh! He just stood there and watch... and watch. One day he just showed up from behind... with his camera. He was just-- he was... He was-- I was just-- something inside-- I just-- I was just snap! Am I being punished? Whoever's doing this, they're toying with us. They want us to suffer. One, two, three, four... I'm sorry about earlier. I was confused. It's-- uh, it's all right. Don't worry about it. You don't look at me like other men. Well, um... Where did you meet her? - Online. - Online? - Yeah. - You're kidding me. Online? Look, you know, I can lie to you and pretend that I have this exciting and original life and all that, but... the truth is far from that. I'm gonna be 30 next year, and I still don't know what I want to be, except that I don't want to be what I am now. G-guys, I got it. I think I got it. - Really? - Come here! I think this is it. Yeah, that's it. So how do we read it to know where we're going? Hmm? What about a circular dam? We're gonna need more. In here. Ooh. Let me see. Let me see. If we met out in the real world, do you think we'd be friends? More like a fling. A fling? Looks like there's some writing. "Gideon looked and beheld death. And the act of seven times 70..." "...brought the harbringer of hell." It's a riddle of some kind. What do you think it means? I don't know. What's seven times 70? - 490. - Okay. What is it? It's a key of some kind. Think it's for the exit? So where's the door? Everybody pick a corner, search for anything-- something small like a keyhole, something we missed. Let's go. Tyler. - Tyler, what happened? - Tyler, what just happened? The the the-- the door just-- Tyler! - Hey, Tyler, you all right? - Guys, the water! - Help, guys! Help! - On three, okay? One... Guys. help me! Stay calm. We're gonna get you out of here. - Emma! - It's not even moved an inch. - Open the door! - Come, look over here! Here! Look, this way! Guys, don't leave! Don't! - Don't leave, please! - Ty, it's okay. It's okay. - Who are you? - Morgan. What the fuck you doing here? I was out... and from nowhere, someone hit me. I woke up here. It's been days. Please. Please help me. Please help me. Help me. - They want us to swap. - Swap? Swap what? What? The girl for Tyler. We unlock her, we throw her in the crevice, Tyler gets free. Wait a minute, David. How do you know this? - Are you sure? - No. We have no time to waste. Tyler's gonna die. - We have to do something right now. - No. No. Emma? I know-- I know why I'm here. What are you talking about? Oh, he always said he was gonna do it. He always said it. The school thinks you're nothing more than a stale piece of shit - and you know that. - What do you mean? We make them know we exist. I never believed him. So why are you putting bullets in? No no, Ron, we're scaring the shit out of the football team, then we're walking away, okay? Listen, listen, you're in this. There's no backing out no matter what. Okay, just shh. It's all right. Everything's all right. I knew what I had to do. He deserved it. He deserved it. Listen, it's not your fault. This is why I'm here. This is what I deserve. - What? What's going on? - Come on, we gotta go. Tyler, Tyler, I'll be right back. Emma. I tried to stop him. I told him. I tried to stop him. I did. Who is she, Emma? Come on, you've got to talk to us! I knew it wasn't right. I knew it wasn't right. Calvin didn't tell me what was going on. I didn't know. Please. Plea-- - You've got to believe me. - Sh-sh-- shut up. - Shut up. - Please? - I didn't know. - Shut up! - Please! Please! - Shut up! Do you understand? Either she has to die or Tyler's gonna die! - We have no time. - We have no choice. Please. Guys. David. - Give me the key. - No. - Do it, David. - David. No. David. We got-- we gotta do this. - Give me the key. - No. - David. - Come on! No! No no no! Please! What are you doing to me? I don't wanna die! Please! No! No! No! Please help me! Help me, please! Please! I don't wanna die! Please! I don't wanna die! Emma! Emma! Help! Please! Emma, please help me. Oh, Emma, please help me! Please help me! Please help! Please! No! Help help! Please, no no! What happened? Wha...? Oh man. Jesus Christ. Holy shit. Who was Morgan? I don't wanna talk about it. You Okay? Actually, I'm fine. Well... I did what had to be done. The strange thing is... I, uhm... I don't feel any guilt. I don't know what's happened to me. Do you have any idea what we did down there just now? Yeah, but we're alive, Tyler's alive and that the price we had to pay. Who was it? Who'd you kill? No one. Somebody you knew well? Was it a stranger? - Fuck off. - Emma, stop... hiding from me. You're a killer, Emma. It's why you're here. I've been playing shitty bars... eight years. And the only applause I get is "Show me your tits." Vice President of A&R... he takes me into his little, uh-- his little fuck room. All I had to do to get out was... you know, just shut off my feelings for an hour and be done with it. But I just can't. And this guy isn't gonna take that from me. You know, when you ram an ice pick into a man's throat... there's a lot of blood. I mean there's a lot of fucking blood. And that little innocent girl that we just killed? She put me in that room. Get off of me. And she left me there. Do you think that Kim's right? Do you think that... this is our punishment? I think we've all done things we can't forgive ourselves for. Guys, guys, come here, come here. What do you got? "He was given the keys to the nine gates where he left those he held dear." Nine gates, nine levels... in hell. What do each of these levels mean? Level one was for the unbaptized. Level two for the lustful, three for the gluttonous. The worse the crime, the higher the level. So what crime fits us? Murder. Who goes to level nine? Traitors. Hey, you guys smell that? I feel-- I feel dizzy. What? - There's something in the air. - Yeah. We gotta find a way out. There's something in the air. No no. - No. - Come on. Don't leave her. Don't leave her. - God damn it, come on, Jin. - No, David! Where-- where's David? How did the cage fall? I must've pressed a button or something. So where do we go now? Let's go home. "The tear shed by the soldier of the lamb"? What the hell is that supposed to mean? David. How did you know those numbers? He shed a tear for each one of his soldiers that he killed. David, what the fuck is going on? David, who is in that painting? Tell me. Talk to me. Tell me. Tell me. Gideon. He was the finest warrior of the Israelites. After a great battle, he and his men were murdered by the Midianites while they slept. But instead of going to heaven, they were all sent to hell. You see, unknown to each other, they'd all wrongfully killed throughout their battles. Gideon made a deal with the devil... who agreed to let one of them free. Gideon felt assured that his men would pick him. But the devil... had a different plan. He gave each of them a weapon and said, "The last heart beating will be the one allowed to leave." Gideon slaughtered his own soldiers. His friends... that he fought next to his entire life. Eventually he walked out of hell. That's us. I mean, we're all killers here. How do you know that story? My father used to tell it to me when I was a kid. So it comes down to this. We can't kill each other. All right, come on. We're a team now. If I have to shoot a thousand people, I'll do it... but not you guys. Come on, we'll outsmart it. - All right? We always do. - No, we won't, Tyler. Can't you see that? Huh? I mean, they are getting exactly what they want from us. All of us. We're the devil's students. Now we're learning his lessons. So that's it? Hmm? We're one fucking step away from getting home and we're stopping now? No way. Shh shh shh. They're designed to hear heartbeats. When there's only one heart beating, the doors'll open. Are you sure that-- Maybe you read it wrong. Maybe it's something else, a different story. Is there something we're missing here, Jin? It's-- it's Tuesday, isn't it? What? My daughters are playing. Tyler, get out of here. Get out of here! Fuck! Do you remember what I told you, Jin? I didn't know what I wanted to be? You might be the only person I've told that to, and here we are. In the middle of hell I chose to open up to a total stranger. You were right about this place, Jin. And do you know what I've learned from this-- from this beautiful experience? What I want to be? When I killed that man, it was the best feeling I've ever felt. And then when I killed the others. That's right, I lied. I didn't run away. I killed them. I killed them one by one! All of them! Then I waited for you guys to come, and I was going to kill all of you too. Then the curiosity took over. I wanted to watch. I wanted to watch how you guys were gonna make it. I was afraid in the first place... what I was feeling. But not anymore. I'm a killer, Jin. That is what I want to be. That is what I truly am. I'm sorry, Jin... we have to say goodbye this way. I have no choice. Will you stand and fight me? I'm sorry, Kim. What? I was the one that pulled the lever. What did you say? I just wanted to see my kids again. I won't fight you. I won't. I'm not gonna become what they want. Do you hear that?! Jin. Is Jin dead? Throw me the sword, David. - Tyler. - Do it. Is there another way out of this, David? Please tell me there is. I don't know, Tyler. - I need help, David. - I'm trying. I'm trying, buddy- I'm sorry to spoil the heart to heart. - Okay okay. - Okay? David, what have you done? David. David. Emma. Jesus Christ, you're all right. Stay back. No, you don't understand. I believed you. Emma, please. Move. - What? - I said turn around and move. - Emma. - Now! Get your hands up. - I'm not gonna fight you. - Shut up. Keep walking and get your hands up. Higher. Stop. I hope your singing career works out. I really do. I can't do it. I can't do it. Why Tyler? - He was just a kid. - It was Kim. I couldn't save Tyler. I couldn't save Jin. I'm not a killer, Emma. Help me. No! Emma, come on. Come on! Come on! You saved me? I figured it was gonna be lonely. - Who are you? - This is the gauntlet. It is our mission to break the backs of pride. It was built so you would know what Gideon felt when he walked out of hell. He thought he was God's servant. But on his journey, he came to know his true calling. Just as you will, David. Father. I had to be someone else when you were a boy to keep the secret. Now you get to meet your real father. See, I've watched you every step of the way. You remembered. You remembered everything I taught you - about how to get through. - You killed those people. You ruined their lives. You turned us into killers for a game? David... this is what you were born to become. Everyone in that gauntlet was handpicked to test your leadership, your ingenuity and your resolve. We are the bringers of God's wrath, and you will be our hands of death. You will bring light to the dark world. You're home. You're home, David. David. No. And you know the rules of the gauntlet. You still have one final task. David. All I ever wanted to be was what you wanted me to be. Not what you're asking me to be now. Emma. Emma! Kill me, my son. Kill me. Take my place in here. Do it! Do it. Do it. Look at you. Look at what you just did. This is what you are. Who will accept you? You no longer fit in that world. You've become something else. You're right. I have.
