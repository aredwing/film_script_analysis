Lung, the luggage is in my room. You can sleep there tonight. What about you? I've got plenty of places to sleep! Remember this picture? The whole gang... They're either dead, in jail or OD on drugs. You're the only one left! But still the Mr. Cool! You've hardly changed yourself. Just a little older Yeah Spent in a Thai prison. Thanks, Brother Hong I wouldn't be here now if it weren't for you. Cut that bullshit! I would've died 9 years ago if it weren't for you! YOU cut that bullshit! Cheers! By the way, this Kowloon Cafe... Do you know why it's called Kowloon (Nine Dragons)? I named it after your namesake. It's only natural that you live here! No more bullshit. Here's to us! Brother Hong... About my family... Thanks. No need. We're brothers. Now that you're back aren't you afraid they may come after you again? I am expecting it. Loyalty? They don't practice that in the Society. You have to take the heat yourself and know when to be on the run. Boss, I'm in deep shit. Fei and Lok are dead. Lung, tell me where you are I'll send help. Don't walk away Just stay put. You are Wong Fat? You've heard about me? Fame is useless. I'll be executed tomorrow. I had money and power. I wasn't scared of anything. But tomorrow... I don't have the guts to walk up to that rope. If I get to choose again I would never have done all those despicable things. I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Get out! Let's go! Lung... I'm glad you've come to terms with yourself. I'm glad too. A toast to our Kowloon Cafe. Here's to good business! And most importantly that we'll enjoy our old age! Lung. You're up early. I better be for my own future's sake. Morning, Brother Hong. Morning! Let me introduce My good buddy, Lung. Morning, Brother Lung! Thanks. I'm Ming, Brother Lung. I'm Switchblade. Cut the bullshit, you all. Let's go to work! Get going! You've really changed, Lung. Really? You would never have acknowledged them before. What would you like? Bun with butter, please. Bun with butter... Make that 2. Sure. No problem. As your please What would you like, folks? Are you new here? Yup. I want the Love Meal A, Handsome. And a cup of Hot Kiss. What exactly is that? Look at him He looks pretty cool but his lower body... What a waste for him to be a cripple. Not really. He's quite handsome. What would you like? Coke. Check out those girls over there. Let me look under those skirts. Hey! What are you looking at? I'm looking at you, so what? What? Can't I look? No Who're you with? We're PK's men! PK? Get lost! We're with Macau Hung! Ever heard of Sister Hung? No Die What? Let me clean up the mess Hey! You're not transparent! Get out of our way or we'll beat you up too! Are you all mute or what? Greet him! Brother Lung! I came over the moment I heard you're back, Brother Lung. When you were trapped in Thailand Brother San needed me so I stayed with him. But on one condition, that I'd return to you as soon as you're back. Return to what? Working as a busboy? Interested? Please don't mock me, Brother Lung. So he's Cool Nine Dragons! And you called him a cripple! I really want to come back to you. I'm out of the game. No, really. I... Give him an uniform... Otherwise, leave. I'm leaving. Long Hair! I almost forgot. Please do me a favor. Get the orange, the green and the yellow out for me. Thanks. Got it, Brother Lung. Green, orange, yellow. Get out.

We'll go now. Call us if you need anything Brother Lung! Goodbye, Brother Lung. See you, Brother Lung Bye, Brother Hong. I recognize them They're Prince's and Eagle's boys. Really? Goodbye, Brother Hong. Goodbye, Brother Lung! Goodnight. Why are you two still here? I don't want to Go home Go home now or I'll start charging you rent! Why don't you just hire us to work part-time? Bye Even though they hang out here It's better than standing on the streets Alright! It's not time yet Why are you closing up so soon? It's already 10 pm, Miss. Look here It's only 9:59. It's you again, Beautiful? You're always late. Come earlier tomorrow. I'll go count the money. Come earlier tomorrow. Damn! I would've made it if I weren't talking to you. Miss! What? You dropped something. What did I drop? Your cigarette butt. Consider it my gift to you, Mr. Cool! Bye! Let's go! Let's go! Brother Hong, what do you think of the gangsters of today? PK Keung, Macau Hung... What kind of names are they? PK Keung is just a kid. Macau Hung has gained some reputation in recent years. But I've never met her. Their world is no longer our business. I smell onions. What are you making? Good stuff. Malaysian onion chicken noodles and Taiwanese tomato beef noodles. What's this? Fugitive cuisine? Where did you learn that? My old man taught me. My dad... Was his funeral a presentable one? Thanks. Get out! First you became a gangster now you fight with knives. You're in deep shit! Don't come back! Leave! What deep shit? You think I can't take the heat myself? You think YOU can take the heat? You friends had always bailed your ass out. Even I took the heat for you! You won't be able to handle it. Leave! I can handle it if I can handle my buddies! What do you know? My son... Your father's days are numbered. The doctor said I only have 2 weeks to live. I don't think you can come back to Hong Kong and see me for the last time. But, I want you to know that I've forgiven you. because I am still your father. Also I know that, someday you'll turn back to the right path. Dad. Strong onions, eh? Nothing to do with onions. It's regret. Brother San. Well? Are you going back to Lung? You no longer want to stay with me? I followed you when Brother Lung went down. After all, you two were buddies. We had a deal. Now that he's back... I know he's back. Had he asked you? No. He hadn't even asked. Then why are you so anxious to leave? Do you have a thing for cripples or what? It's all right. I'll go talk to Lung. There's no hurry You should choose wisely. Today's Special: Tomato Beef Noodles We're here, Brother Lung. I saw you. Don't smoke so much. Yes, Brother Lung. Iced Lemonade. Lung! You didn't even call. Luckily I've got my sources. Well, are you all right? What's with your legs? Nothing. Any drinks? My treat. With that crippled leg of yours you're nobody. You have nothing to stand on now. And you want my boys to go back to you? I never said that. That's good then. Don't go limping around now. Boss invites you to dinner tonight. You'll be there, right? You can go in my place. And, tell Boss that the triad's business is no longer my business. Why did you come back then? What's wrong with staying in Thailand? How about this? Why don't you move to Yuen Long, raise some pigs and grow some veggies? That will be perfect for the rest of your life That's a thought. But let me tell you I'm content being a waiter. I don't owe any one anything. It's the Society that owes us. Not the other way around. Fine. I know you never eat your words. I admire people like you who have perseverance. Keep it up. You'll make it! I'll keep it in mind. Thanks. Are you leaving? So soon? He didn't even call you Brother Lung! How soon he forgets the one that helped him most! What would you like? I recommend our Tomato Beef Noodles It's great! But I want extra tomatoes and extra beef. Also extra noodles and extra soup. That's 2 bowls then, kid. No, just one big full bowl. What's the difference? Then, do you count 1 to 10 twice? What? You're so dumb you have to count 1 to 10 two times! You're Cool Nine Dragons! Brother Lung! Nice to meet you. Your nickname was Mr. Cool. And you used to watch over Mongkok Yaumauti and Tsimshatsui! Ready to order? What would you like? Iced Lemon Tea, less sugar. Curry Beef Fried Rice. And Beef and Vegetable Dumplings! Add a side order of Chinese Broccoli! Thanks! She sure got an appetite! Stay here. Have you bought your lottery ticket? The sum is now over 80 million! I'll buy one for you. No need, thanks. Then watch the kid for me. I'll be right back. Thanks, Brother Lung. Behave now, okay? Another Coke for me, silly. Sure. Brother San! I thought you're in the hospital! Brother San! Boss. He said he's not coming. He said he's gone straight. Maybe he doesn't want to give you face. Is he still mad about Thailand? What's to be mad about? There're no personal benefits there! It's always for the good of the Society! Did he expect us to take the heat? Boss, it's good that you sent Lung to Thailand back then. Otherwise, we wouldn't have gotten the money back. We sacrificed Lung for the good of the Society. Should we hire him again? After all, he was a talent. He managed the three districts well. A talent? He's a cripple now! Just let him rot. In any case, tell him not to fuck around with me. Otherwise, I wouldn't give him any face. Let's eat! Don't get angry, Boss. Cheers! Bye, Brother Lung We're closing now, you all. Time to go home. Come on! You girls are always like this. Goodnight. Goodbye, Mr. Cool. Go home now. Bye See you tomorrow. What to do now? Your mom remembered the lottery but forgot about you. Where do I sleep, Dad? What did you call me? Dad. Do you know where your mom is? Looks like he's used to it. Bonnie, please. Who's this? I'm Lung from the Kowloon Cafe. Now stop gambling and come pick up your son. He's not my son. He's the kid Helen had with you. I'm on the run now. You take care of him. Also, he's been dying to meet you. That's it then. Hey! What're you talking about? She said she's on the run. You're kidding. She also said he's my son. Kid, what's your mom's name? Helen. And your dad's? Nine Dragons. Then what's your name? How old are you? Poon Siu Lung (Little Dragon) Where did you sleep last night then? The place where I stayed. And the night before? The place where I stayed. Are you done asking? What a nuisance! Not until you tell us where your mom is. I haven't seen her in a long time. I have to take a bath and go to bed now. Otherwise I'll be late for school. Fine. Bathroom is over there. You remember who Helen was? Helen was Poon Yim Hung. I remember. Bonnie said the kid was Helen's and mine. Now that I think about it She did look pregnant after you went to Thailand. She even said she wanted to look for you there. If you count the years that does sound right. So, what now? We can't leave him on the streets. Let him stay for the night. At least until we find his mom. It's not too bad to have a son this age. I'm going to bed! Please buy me some new clothes tomorrow, and turn the lights off for me Good night! Damn kid. He's just like you. Sister Hung. This is for you. Thanks, Sister Hung. Only for you. Bonnie has been looking for you Do you want to call her? She's short on cash again? Why won't she grow up like the rest of us? Hey, where are you? You're not in Hong Kong? Then who's looking after Siu Lung? The money was for him not for you to gamble with. You better not abuse him. Of course I won't, Sister Hung. Even though your boyfriend doesn't like him I'll still follow your orders. I've taken care of Siu Lung. I need $30,000 more, Sister Hung Please help me. I've helped you one too many times. Sister Hung, I'll give you some news in exchange. I'm listening. The first news is that Brother Lung Had been released from jail in Thailand. He's back in Hong Kong now. Go on. The second news is that Lung's living at Kowloon Cafe on Shanghai Street. Since I couldn't reach you I've left your son with him. Sister Hung, so will I get the money? Sister Hung? I always keep my word. Thanks, Sister Hung! Cool Nine Dragons is back? Yeah, that's the rumor. Xiao Si, you go back first. Yes, Sister Hung. Don't think you can bully us just because we're Taiwanese. Fine. Thanks for giving me face. You're late. I've been waiting to eat with you. My flight was delayed. Have some. I was supposed to have dinner with the Hong Kong Gang. But you hadn't returned. Just you is enough. I'm going to take a bath. Lung, go to Thailand and take care of him. But don't kill him. He owes the Society lots of money. Call us once you've captured him. But be careful He's a heavyweight over there. Lok, Fei, you two come with me. Yes, Brother Lung. Brother Lung, what about me? You're getting married! What about us? Be his best men! I'm going to Thailand for a few days. Thailand? Why? Business. I want to go too! It's not for fun. It's business! Now move. I don't care. I am going. Sit down. Can I bring this? Fine. Go and pack. Don't forget toothbrush and toothpaste. Open the door! What are you doing? Let me out! Time to take me to school, Dad! Wake up, Dad! I'm up. Stop shaking me. Special Breakfast, kiddo! Thanks, silly. He's calling me silly again! What's up, silly? Morning, Brother Lung. I have to take him to school You guys will handle breakfast. Sure! Brother Lung, should you take a blood test? Or a DNA, B, C test to prove it? No need! How about a tongue rolling test? That will work. You're nuts. Are you done? We have to get going. Here's my phone number Call me if you need help. No need. I'll know the way after you take me to school once. Just hang on to it. Turn left here. Siu Lung, can you do this? I don't think you can. You're such a retard. You're calling me a retard? Who took you to school normally? I go to school by myself. What about mommy? I don't know. She doesn't care about me so I don't care about her. Wait for me! Dad! Wait! Thanks. Miss Mung. Time for class, Siu Lung. Let's go. Where are you going? To see my son. All dressed up? His birthday's coming up. Bye. No answer? Of course not She wouldn't have left the kid here if she wants to talk to you. Since you like him so much why don't you just take him in? Dad, I'm home! I'm going to do my homework. He works harder than you and me! Like father, like son. Are you really doing your homework? That's right, Dad. Are you hungry? Yes. What would you like? I want Tomato Beef Noodle. Extra noodles, extra soup. And extra beef. You're early today, Miss. I just got off work. Why did you two page me in such a hurry? We had to. What is it then? Lisa is taking us to dinner. Then we're going to a rave. Go home and get changed. So soon? Let me catch my breath first. Give me a cigarette. It's still daylight and you're smoking already? Does it matter? Where's my cigarette butt? I've thrown it away. How can you throw away my gift? What would you like, Miss? This. I heard that you cooked it. Good choice. Been here long? Of course Lung. Mr. Cool! I'll be back for your order. Have you taken any of my $10 coins? Why? I am always missing some. Can't be the staff. Can't be. I trust them. Just coins, not bills, right? Never mind then. This is delicious! We have to go. Fine, fine. Then come on. I'll pay for it. How much, Brother Hong? $80. Thanks. This is for you. Don't throw it away this time. Bye! She told you not to throw away. Your sidewalk is filthy We'll clean it for you. We can clean it ourselves Are you from the urban council? Protection money. Hey! Your sidewalk is filthy We'll clean it for you. We can clean it ourselves Are you from the urban council? Protection money. Protection money? Go out and take a look. Run, Boss! Long Hair! Run! Let's go, Brother Hong! Brother Lung! Get them! It hurts! Hold on! I'm bleeding! I'll never collect protection money again! What's this? $300 fucking dollars? What do you think I am, a beggar? What are you looking at? Give me more! Are you guys done? Sister Hung. Who are you with? Sorry, Sister Hung. We're leaving. You're back. Have a seat. What would you like to drink? You don't remember? It's always been Iced Lemon Coffee. Right. I'll get it for you. Iced Lemon Coffee, please. We have a son? What happened to your leg? Why didn't you take care of him? You used to be so cool! Now you won't even strike back? You'd have beaten them senseless by now! I just want to know one thing. Are you taking him back or leaving him here? Are you telling me that you plan to stay at this cafe for life? Come back to the Society I'll help you. I don't need your help. I feel... happy here. I just need to know... don't you care about our son? It's all right It's my responsibility. I don't know what's gotten into you. I don't care what it takes You will come back. Are you leaving? Go and see our son. He's upstairs. So, you know Miss Hung? She almost never comes here. That stubborn 7-11 It's the End of Summer The overly bright neon light The skies too pale Only fools argue Falling leaves are the risks the trees have to take Feelings are occasional incidents An alternative cure for insomnia Are you satisfied with your love? Any new discoveries? An experiment in tenderness The body language of love Working hard at loving a person Has nothing to do with happiness Just be careful that the distance from love to hate is not that far Lovers who can swallow happiness They try hard to understand But seldom succeeding Those whose dreams come true will only make others jealous It's easier to hurt the one you love the most Just give in to your fatigue It's not worth it... Bravo, Sister Hung! You're pretty high tonight Sister Hung. Being on your own turf does make a difference. Come on. Let's talk. San. I need you to get me some stuff. I want to strike it big! A big investment, huh? Working with Prince? There's no need. I want to open 3 more joints. You get the stuff and I'll get the bouncers. I've got plenty of men. Let's do it together. No need. I've found myself a huge partner. Once he's ready everyone will flock to his side. Who's the tough guy? Are you referring to me? Are you kidding? Tell me. I don't want to scare you to death. Give me a hint. Cool Nine Dragons. Boss! You told us to collect protection money at Kowloon Cafe, right? That cripple is worthless. I poured the whole glass of water on him and he didn't even fight back! He's scared shitless. Too bad Sister Hung got there and spoiled the fun! Scare me to death? He couldn't even avoid a glass of water! What a dead dog. Today's Special: Malaysian Onion Chicken Noodles Brother Hung, we heard that you're a great boxer. Your kicks were powerful too! Today's Special is Chicken Noodles. Just eat and cut the crap. Lung, telephone. It's a woman. I'm Miss Mung, Siu Lung's teacher. Are you his parent? Yes. I just want to tell you that Siu Lung hit his classmates today. That's a serious violation of the school codes. We need to have a conference with you. I'll be right there. Bye. Lung, where are you going? I've to go get it. Get what? Miss? I'm Poon Siu Lung's father Man Lok Yin. What can I do for you? You're his parent? But his records show that he has no father. He took his mother's name. I see. What can I do for you? He got into a fight with other classmates. There were two witnesses who saw the incident. He wouldn't explain to me what happened. So I have to mark the violation on his records. Mark him? Marking his records might affect his future education prospects. Can you give him a chance? Of course not. He gets into fights at such a young age. Such behavior cannot be tolerated. You don't have to plead anymore. I have to do this, even though your noodles were good. In that case, I have to do this too. I wonder what the principal would say if they saw this videotape of you smoking? When did you tape this? When you were smoking. You're despicable! No wonder your son is like you! I didn't learn that from my dad! The three of them hit me That's why I struck back! Three of them? The three of them beat you up? Yes. Tsang, Pang, and Lee beat me up. They said that I don't have a father or a mother that nobody wants me and that I'm like a beggar. So what if they have a father or a mother? You heard that. Those who got beaten get marked. I wonder how you're going to mark the other 3 kids? I will look into this. I know it's not all his fault. So stop blackmailing me and give me back that tape. Sure, if you like. You'll enjoy it. I'll leave now, if that's all right. By the way, I want to ask. Are teachers allowed to smoke? Teachers need to have privacy too! Thanks, Dad. You were really cool back there. Dad, do you play soccer? What do you think? Come on! Why are you laughing like a fool? I have a dad too. Here, take this. Thanks, Dad. Man Lok Yin! Hey, Gorgeous. Get out of my way! Man Lok Yin! There're only cartoons on here. Where's the footage of me smoking? Give it to me now! I just picked the tape at random. Did you enjoy it? What? Then did you actually tape me smoking? Do you see any cameras here? So, you tricked me! Damn! Don't swear. Have a seat. OK. Forget it. What would you like? My treat tonight. Just tonight? But I come here every night! Then I'll treat you every night. Get back to work! What are you, a bystander? Poon Siu Lung! Poon Siu Lung. Who's taking you home? No one. I'll take you home. That's okay I know how to get back home. I'm going the same way too Let's go! $50.00 I'm back! Where's Dad? Upstairs. Do you think this is too childish? He is a child. Miss Mung You brought him here? Thanks! It's OK I told Miss Mung there's no need. But she said it's on her way. It is. I live close by here. What do you think? It's nice. It's for you. Also... A new backpack! Yours is too old Let me take it off. Come on! Take it off! Your backpack is so heavy! Why do you have so many $10 coins? Where did the money come from? I took it from downstairs Don't hit me! Have I ever hit you? Don't come near, or I'll hit you! You adults are always running around. No one cares when I'm hungry. So I took some money to take care of myself. I don't want to be kicked around by adults! Who has hit you before? Auntie, Mr. Na, Auntie Bonnie they all hit me! Then do you know that you can't use your fists all the time? Tell you what. We'll make a deal. Promise me you won't steal money anymore. And no more hitting. Come. Hooking pinkies seals the deal You promised. So did you. You look great in those new clothes. Thanks, Dad. Here's another drink. Thanks. Had enough? Yes. I'll take these. Do you have to correct homework every night? Yes What drink is this, Miss Mung? Finish your homework and I'll buy you one. Cool! Greedy kid. Come here. Sit down. I'll tutor you. I told you Miss Mung is here! Why did you turn off your cell phone? What is it? There's a rave tonight. I'm not going. You're kidding. You would rather stay here and tutor a kid than go to a rave? Are you turning to your maternal side? Do I know you? Just back off. Stop acting innocent! Are you crazy? Stop bullying the kid! Siu Lung, come with me. So she wants to play? Put this pill in her drink and she'll come to you quick! Don't do it! She's our friend! You took them and you're still alive! Are you sure she'll be alright? Mung! You're right. I was wrong. Please accept my apology drink. I'm sure there's a reason for it Just put it down. Have a sip. You stay out of it, you little punk! Stop hitting him! Who do you think you are, dude? He's my son. He's your son? I'm sorry. I'll hit even harder! It's breaking! Let me go! Excuse me, please! I'll let you go this time. Now scram! And don't ever come back! Well, are you alright? Are you hurt? I'm fine. Dad, I thought you said you wouldn't hit people. He wasn't hitting them. Dad was just trying to prevent them from hitting you. I need to talk to you. What is it? He drank my beverage. So? It's delicious! Those two guys put an Ecstasy pill in it. He should be fine. We always take two pills at a time. Don't say anymore! Siu Lung? Siu Lung! Come out here, you cripple! Let's go to the hospital. I'll go with you. Brother Lung! There're lots of guys outside! Take him to the hospital. Take the backdoor! Who do you think you are you goddamn cripple? You've got nothing to say, you chicken? How dare you hit my boys? Ask him why he hit my son. Because I felt like it! I am Long Hair of Kowloon! Who dares to bother Brother Lung? I'm Eagle of Kowloon! Who do you think you are to bother our Brother Lung?! We're from the Kowloon Cafe! It's for you, Boss. Boss, we have a problem! What now? Brother Prince, Nine Dragons is gathering his boys... Boss, Nine Dragons is showing off tonight. There're more than a hundred men! He's a cripple and he's still causing trouble! Nine Dragons is stirring up shit. Even Long Hair brought his boys in support. Sister Hung? It's Jo Jo. Cool Nine Dragons was so cool tonight. Everyone was on his side! Sorry, my brothers. I've brought my two boys here to apologize. Apologize to Brother Lung! Sorry, Brother Lung! We're going. Don't let them go! Let them go! Thanks, Brother Lung. Let's go! Hurry! I'm glad I had my scouts here. We came as soon as I heard. We weren't so late either. Let us come back to you Brother Lung. Let us join you, Brother Lung. Join me? What for? WHAT FOR? I've made up my mind and I won't change it! Please go. How's Siu Lung? He's fine, Brother Lung. The doctor is still treating him. How about you? I'm fine. Come over here, Brother Lung. What is it? I'm sorry I really don't know them well. I only hang out with the girls I hardly knew those guys. Please believe me. So you take Ecstasy? Not at all! I just like to dance. Well, you're still young. I'm not young! I'm already 20! You can teach at 20? Why not? After all, I was a valedictorian at Teachers' College. Teaching is great. You get 90 days of vacation each year! You need that many days? Of course, so I can have fun! Fun? Still, it's good to be you. Always happy and carefree. Yup, and I hardly have any worries. It's good to live a simple life. And I'm just doing what I like as long as I don't hurt anyone. I'll tell you a secret. My family gave me a nickname: Little Dumbbell. But don't tell anyone! Little Dumbbell. Will you still let me hang out at your cafe? Why not? You're... How's Siu Lung? He's fine He's still with the doctor. Who are you? I'm Miss Mung, his schoolmaster. I need to talk to you. Are you here to see your son? No, to see you. I've gotten a cargo from San. $15 million. It's under our names. I've already paid the money. Just ask your boys to come back to the clubs. You were great tonight. They all showed up and you didn't even need to holler. All of them are still waiting for you. Have you lost your mind? How old are we now? We even have a son. Why was he here at the hospital? It's because of those drugs. I thought you were Mr. Cool. Now you only care about a kid. He's not just a kid. He's our son. I've been a son too! Can't we just do our duty? What about me? Have you ever thought of me? You locked me in the bathroom on the day you left. I had to ask where you were in Thailand and why They all thought I was nuts! I really hate you. I hated myself even more! What had I done to deserve you leaving me? I didn't bring you along because I was worried for your safety. So, does that mean you cared? What about now? Say something. Just like before. It was my fault. I was wrong back then. But I don't want you to vent your anger on our son. Our son. What do you mean our son? You gave birth to him so he's our son! That's none of your fucking business! Say that again. He's only my son. Poon Siu Lung is not yours. Are you serious? He's not your son! I really wished he were! I don't hate him. I also want to love him. But I just can't. It hurts me every time I see him. Because he makes me think of you. Is he all right, doctor? He's fine now. You're born to live a gangster's life. I have to be with you, no matter what. We'll make a name for ourselves. Not for me, no. Just... just forget about it. I'll walk you home. There's no need I live just a few blocks from here. That's even better. Come on. Where is it? Almost there By the way, your son Siu Lung is a good boy. My son? I guess. How long have you been divorced? Divorced? I've never been divorced. Because technically I was never married. You weren't married? So it was hip to have a son out of wedlock back then? Actually, I think you are very brave. Why do you say that? Because I know it's hard for people like you to start it over. Let me ask you If you've suddenly gotten something you thought you'd never have you would be happy, right? What would you do if it were suddenly taken away from you? Do you mean love? No. The lottery. Just the lottery? It's fate, I guess It all depends on luck. But love is different. If you find the one you want you'll miss it if you don't go for him. That's why they're two totally different things. Sister Hung. You should just end the game San is not easy to deal with. Why don't we go back to Prince? That's exactly why I want to play with San. The harder the game the better. Go and find Cool Nine Dragons if I get into trouble. He'll come and help me. What if he doesn't? He will come I want to see him in all of his former glory. I thought you'd never come Sister Hung Have a seat. Hope you like '86. We work well together and we keep our books clean. You've got the stuff but I haven't got a penny. Are you playing with me? So what if I am? Macau Hung, don't be cocky just because Prince backs you up. I don't need Prince. My partner and I are more than enough to play with you. That cripple? Do you think I'm dumb or what? I'm warning you. Pay me the money or I won't give you the respect anymore. That's it. Fine. Consider this as my disrespect to you then. Sister Hung, you better go. Just go!

You looking for me, Cool Nine Dragons? You can speak Cantonese. I understand. Good. I also understand Mandarin. Get him a drink! Thanks. San kidnapped Helen for taking $15 mil of his goods. I know. I also knew about you two. The past stays in the past. I just want to alert you so you can rescue her. I've heard that you're pretty capable yourself. Why don't you go help her? Because you're her type of man not me. Besides, I don't have the manpower. Let me think about it. Later. You have to finish it now. San. I'm here to take Macau Hung away. Fine. Where's the money? Or the stuff? Are you saying that Prince cannot be trusted? It's a pretty big sum. With no collateral would you trust me if it's the other way around? Here's $7.5 million. You'll get the other half tomorrow night. How am I supposed to find the goods if you don't giver her back to me? I'll trust you for now. Get me the stuff tomorrow and I'll give you back your check.

But let me tell you. I'm still waiting for him to come back to me. We're finished. All because of Lung? No. Because you slapped me. If not for Lung would you stay even if I slapped you? I'm telling you! Return the goods by tomorrow or I'll take care of both of you! Can we eat now? I'm really hungry Let's not wait any longer. No way! Dad is not back yet. He's back now!

My luck is right here with me. Coming! You really didn't show up. Do you have to be that cruel? Seven years ago and now this? You still don't get it? I've made myself clear. We're finished. Just let it go. You're telling me to let it go now? You should've told me when I was 17! Your boys and me hold the fort everyday while you're away. You think we did it for heroics? We did it for you! Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. And I never imagined that I would affect so many. So I've been a fool for these past 6 years then?! I love you no matter who you are. I just want to be with you. Sorry Give me a chance I want to make a fresh start. Fine We won't be needing these then. They're only worth $15 million! Just throw them all away! I'll take the heat because you won't! Stop it! Stop it! Wake up! So you want me to take the heat with you on this? Fine. I'll take it! But, can you take it? I used to hear this question myself. My dad took it for me! Sorry... But you have really disappointed me. Sorry. Sorry. I waited for you all this time. But you've never cared for me. Mom, please don't cry. Siu Lung... I'm so sorry. Can we live here, Mom? Mom is going to walk you to school tomorrow. Great! What about after school? I'll walk you home. Now go to sleep. I haven't slept with you in a long time, Mom. Good night. I want to have some cake, Mom. I can get it myself. Morning, Dad. Morning. Lemon Coffee. Thanks. Go ahead. I am walking Siu Lung to school today. Don't worry. I'll leave Hong Kong once I settle things with San. Where will you be going? I don't know yet. Once I've settled down I would like you to bring Siu Lung to me. I want to take care of him. That's fine. Thanks. But I can visit him if I want to see him, right? Happy Birthday! Here. My first birthday with both Dad and Mom! Let's cut the cake. Wait. We'll cut it together. Morning Good morning, Miss Mung. Bye, Mom. Be a good boy now. I'll pick you up. Good morning, Miss Mung. San? Returning the goods is out of the question. I'll transfer $10 million to your account. What about the $5 million? You'll get it in a few days. How many days? Do you want it or not? Brother Prince. San here. I'm cashing your check for sure. That Macau Hung only paid back some of the money. What's with you? You can't even handle your own woman What did you say? You've been cuckolded and you don't even know it? She slept at Cool Nine Dragons' place last night. I'm telling you this as a friend. So you can still act cocky in public. But you're more of a cuckold now! Shut up! Come to my office's rooftop tonight. I'll show you who's the boss. Fine. Are you busy? Can you make me some noodles? Extra beef and tomatoes right? No problem! Lung, come here. Watch the counter for me. Where are you going? To have a chat with Long Hair. Must you? You may not care, but I do. Come on. I'll be back soon. Mom? Isn't this cute? What are you doing? This is Mr. Prince's order Sister Hung. Sorry. Please get in the van. Lung, your noodles are ready. OK. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Get out, all of you! Leave! Leave, I said! Just ignore them. Keep going! Stop it! He's on our side! Side? What side? Bull! You can mess up other joints. But you can't mess with Brother Lung's joint! I'm just following Prince's order Eagle. Please stay out of this. We won't respect you anymore if you trash this place! I'll check with my boss. It's Bull, Brother Prince. I'm at the cafe. Hand the phone to him. It's for you. I really, really dislike you. Many people close to me have left because of you. We must settle this once and for all. Helen and her son are with me. Come to my office's rooftop at 7. You will come, won't you? I'll be there. You can talk to my boss about this. It's a wrap! How can we help? No need. I'll handle it. We'll be going then. Goodbye, Brother Lung. Eagle! Thanks. Brother Lung! They've got Helen and Siu Lung! I know. Let's call the cops. No need. I can handle it. You said you're no longer part of their world! I'm doing this for my son not for them. Brother Lung! Please keep an eye on her for me. Sure. Hey, Lung! You're finally here. Prince has been waiting for you. I'll never be content if I don't defeat you in front of all of them tonight! I'm just a referee here. You guys set the rules. If I win, I don't want to see you in Hong Kong ever again! What if you lose? Then you won't see me in Hong Kong. What about my son? He's all yours! Thanks. I have lost. Let them go! Not bad for a cripple. I will leave Hong Kong. You three are staying, right? Bring me the champagne! Cheers, Brother Lung. Here's a toast to brotherhood. Aren't you giving me face? Who are you? Who am I? Did you ask my brother who he was when you killed him? Get out. Sister Hung. Dad! I don't like it here, Dad Let's go. Fine. Let's go. I want to be somebody too! Bastard! Why are you beating my boys? Lung! You can't die! Dad Lung! Lung! Hang on. Hang on! Did you hear me? You can't die! Lung! Dad! LUNG! I... I'm fine. You murderer! Let's toss him down! I'm sorry. I can't keep my promise to you. Sorry. Dad! You can't die, you understand? Lung! No, Lung. No! HQ, one man is hurt Send an ambulance. Never mind. Call the coroner. Dad, why aren't you with Mom? Get out! You gangster! Leave! Do you really want to know? It was my fault. Why was it your fault? I fooled around. Will you leave me, Dad? No. Why not? I've forgiven you because I am still your father. Just apologize to her I'm home, Dad. I've finally come around, Dad.
