My mother raised me, but didn't choose my in-laws well... Mama, you hurt me... Mama, you hurt me... The clear river water flows without end... My lover is forever in my heart, in my heart... I choose the seeds from among a half pint of soybeans... My mother raised me, but didn't choose my in-laws well... Mama, you hurt me... Mama, Mama, you hurt me, you hurt me... Director: Xie Jin Sister Hibiscus... add a little more hot pepper to my bowl! - I want vinegar in mine! - Coming up! Sister Hibiscus, give me some more green onion, hurry! - Guigui... - Hurry up... Sister Hibiscus, I've been waiting all day, hurry! Coming right up! - Did you add more hot pepper? - Of course... It's so hot your belly button will catch fire... If my belly button catches fire, you have to come put it out! Hey miss, one bowl of rice tofu, with extra soup! It's hot today, so I'll give you a bowl of kun soup... Whoa, Sister Hibiscus' hands are whiter than the rice tofu! You pig! Your wife must have not have punished you lately by pulling your ears... My ears have been waiting for you to pull them... Go ahead, have a tug... Get out of here, you brute! Big Momma's here? Come sit here... Make room, make room... Are you well? Business has been great lately, eh? - Yeah... Yours has extra peppers - Oh, great... - Leaving? Take care... - See you next time... Hi, Sister Mangeng... - Hi, Secretary Li... - Pick a big one... Brother Mangeng is here... Eh, Secretary Li is here? Eating tofu, eh? Have a seat... - You want a bowl? - Yeah, I'll have a bowl... - Sister Hibiscus, bring me a bowl, too! - Yeah, I heard you... - Sister Hibiscus, here's the money... - I'll collect it for you... Yuyin, how much have you made today? Mom! Keep going! - Sister Hibiscus, hand me another bowl... - Here you go! Wang Qiushe, are you up yet? Coming... Have you publicized tonight's meeting? I'll do it right away... - What do you think you're doing? - Where's Director Li? You think Director Li is in the pot? I've got some important town business to announce. If I'm delayed, it'll be on you! Ha, you think your bullshit duties are so important? Even at the government shops an official like me can't get a cup of hot water... Don't touch! The world has taken a turn for the worst! You'd think the people in this town had never had rice tofu before! What do you know? Look closer... Those men are acting like hungry cats circling a dead fish! Director, we should set up a food stall. We'd definitely make money, you think? Nonsense! We're a state-run business. Our salary is dependable, but theirs? Director Li, there's a town meeting with the cadres tonight... I know, I know... The "Four Freedoms" policy is getting abused more and more... Old Gu, what are you busy with now? - Nothing! - I'd like a word with you... You want to get dibs on grain again? With such fine grain, you should be able to cook up some pretty decent meals... Whenever the grain distribution director opens his mouth, its about grain... The shop got some Wuling Yeast Liquor, I want to give you two bottles special... Come on, let me fry up a couple dishes for you... Forget about it, people say your state-run shop serves up mouse shit in everything! Watch your mouth! Would I give you mouse shit? Why don't you let me wash the collar of your jacket then? Old Gu, in the cities now everybody is wearing fake collars... OK, that's enough... Old Gu, show up a little early to tonight's meeting! One bowl, please! Fuck off! - Hi, Director Gu! - Hi! I'm here... Guigui, Director Gu is here! - Old Gu is here... - Hey Mangeng... Hey, Director Gu, have a smoke... Qiushe, you're not paying again? Look at Qin Shutian, he eats, pays, and still lends a hand... But you're just a freeloader! This piece of land is still under my name... If I sold it to Hu Yuyin... ...it'd be worth at least two or three thousand bowls of rice tofu! You cheapskate! He's always looking for a handout, what a bum! Using his position to get the good stuff, and still not paying! - That would be wonderful... - Do you have a permit? - Oh, Sister Official, do you want to eat... - Business permit! What's the matter? We're a small stall that pays our taxes... Business permit! Everybody and their kids know me... I'm here to check your permit! If you don't have one, my staff will requisition your stall! Another bowl... another bowl! Hey, shouldn't you say something? OK OK, forget about it! We're all fellow townsfolk, and see each other all the time! If there's a problem, go to the municipal tax office to sort it out! - Sister Hibiscus makes delicious rice tofu! - That's right! Guoxiang, there's a cadre meeting tonight, were you notified? You assume I don't know anything because I'm not a local... - Give me another bowl! - She should feel dumb... Uncle... - Crazy Qin! - Here, here... Tell your fellow Five Categories Elements to gather in the town square after supper! - OK, right away... - Why is there so much smoke? - I just had my lunch... - Give me one! - Um, this is my last one... - Hurry up and tell them! Attention Brigade Cadres... Here on the border of three districts, your situation is complicated... Many farmers have abandoned the communes to do trading instead... ...which wreaks havoc on the local markets... ...and sabotages the collective economy of the People's Communes. Rice Tofu Queen: Hu Yuyin Colluders: Li Mangeng & Gu Yanshan For us cadres, how do we deal with this problem? Even though Hibiscus Town hasn't been touched by many political campaigns... The County Party Committee has handed down its strictest resolution yet! Guoxiang, you've been in Hibiscus Town for some time now... Do you have any plans to marry? Not a single one of the men here meet my standards... Secretary Li, they are all assembled! - Crazy Qin! - Here! Let's hurry it up! Everyone at attention! Sir, the Five Categories Elements of Hibiscus Town have finished assembling! - Everyone is here? - Yes, Sir! - Rollcall! - Yes, Sir! The Rightist Qin Shutian?... Here! - The Landlord Zhang Hongde? - Here! - The Landlord Zhang Yaozhong? - Here! - The Bad Element Tian Zhifen? - Here! - The Rich Peasant Liu Deqi? - Here! - The Anti-revolutionary Wang Jincheng? - Here! - The Rich Peasant... Li Fugui? - Here! What's with Li Fugui? Sir, the Rich Peasant Li Fugui... ...suddenly began coughing blood uncontrollably at 3:29 this afternoon... Since he could not be here himself, his grandson is here to replace him... ...and can pass on any further instructions! Ai, such wickedness! Is this class struggle? Hmph! I guess now it has to be passed on to three generations... Everyone go back to work, act conscientiously, and don't make trouble... - Dismissed! - Let's go! Everyone back to work! - Crazy Qin! - Here! Do you have supplies leftover for painting slogans? Sir, I still have some... Paint another slogan on that wall over there. Write... I'lll have a look at some reports... Wait a bit and come by to transcribe it. Yes, Sir! Sir, should today's slogan be painted Whatever you used last time will be fine. Yes, Sir... I guarantee completion of this task! Never forget... ...class struggle! How's it look? Director Gu... Wang Qiushe agreed to sell this part of his land to us... - We want to build a small house here... - Oh... Use this to clean your face... - OK, then... - Take care... Uncle, why was my request to transfer denied? You're the County Party Secretary, can't you help it along? Your transfer order is coming down soon... You are to become Section Chief for the County Commerce Department. - Wow, great! - Have some tea! - Eat some candy, give some to the child! - This house is so bright and merry! After we finish taking down the old house, Guigui and I want to adopt a child... We will call on you for the brigade's support at that time... OK, I'll support you... Director Gu, when the time comes, will you be the child's godfather? Me, godfather? The one who sells you rice chaff? People will talk... Ha ha, I'm just joking, of course I'll be godfather... We'll all prosper! Hey, Li... Manager Li... I mean, Section Chief Li... You've been gone for more than a year, eh? After you get settled, I want to apply for Branch Secretary... - You're Wang Qiushe, right? - Yes... - Wang was a Land Reform activist... - Hi, Old Wang! We'll be coming to your house soon... Huh? My place is a filthy wreck, you don't want to see that... We're looking for someone who has borne a heavy resentment... Take care, watch your step! You officials are really tireless... Comrades, it's already been Yet Land Reform activists like Wang Qiushe... ...have not yet been fully emancipated! How do we solve this problem? If we don't seize class struggle and launch movements, what else can we do? What's going on in the town? Oh, Hu Yuyin is celebrating her new house, its really lively... They have wine and meat, we should go. Chief Li, let's go over there! Hu Yuyin? The one who sells rice tofu? That's her. If I didn't run into you, I would have already gone over there... - Come on, drink up! Give her a full cup! - It's a special occasion! Drink it dry! - Come help me drink this! - OK, I'll help her drink! Open wide and drink it down! - Punish her by making her sing! - Make a speech! I'm no good at speaking... But I'll bow before all of you! Hey, over here! Bow for us, too! OK, over here! Brother Mangeng, help me! OK, OK! Let's ask Old Gu to say a few words... Never forget class struggle! The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer... That's the cause of this polarization we have in the villages... - Comrades, our task here is momentous! - Yes... Qiushe, why didn't you come over and drink yesterday? The rich get richer, the poor get poorer... It's time for a movement... Chief Li, is this movement going to be like during Land Reform? Right, like a second land reform? A second land reform? Should we redraw the class lines? Correct, we are overhauling the class ranks and alignments... ...to make a clear demarcation between left, right and center! Old Wang, you've got quite a few ideas, eh? That's good... Are we going to split up everybody's property and wealth? - Something like that... - Now this is a movement I can support! Old Wang, you are from this place, so tell us... Which cadres in this town are reactionary? And who are the newly rich? Townsfolk Add to the Glory of the People's Commune The Hardworking Couple Receives the Bounties of Socialism Is Hu Yuyin here? Here! Oh, Section Chief Li... I heard you had returned, but I haven't had any time to come by to see you... Come in and have a seat... Guigui! Section Chief Li is here, get some tea ready! - Come in, sit here... - That's OK, I can do it... Go boil some more water... Have some melon seeds... He's still so shy... I should have come here earlier... I came here on behalf of the Work Section to have a look at your new place here... There are a couple matters I'd like to discuss with you... - Have a seat... - Yes... - No market day today? - No... Our County Work Section Committee is in town, you must have heard? We're launching a movement... We're inquiring into each household's political and economic situation... You need to be completely honest with the Work Section, just as with the Party... Do you understand what I mean? - Have some water... - Yes... I have here the basic information of your accounts... Have a look to make sure they are correct... Every market day you sell approximately And take in about 50 yuan... There's six market days a month, so you make about 300 yuan in that time... About 100 is deducted from the net, which leaves 200 yuan... Hu Yuyin... Your income is the same as what a upper-level provincial official makes! We're just a small enterprise... Usually we pass the days in such a muddle, we've never added it up... Section Chief Li, we have a business permit! I never said for certain you broke the law or exploited anyone... OK, we'll leave it here for now... This house is built on land... ...given to the peasant Wang Qiushe during Land Reform, right? And these matching couplets hanging by your door... ...were written by the reactionary Rightist Qin Shutian, right? There's also... ...the matter of Grain Distribution Director Gu Yanshan... ...giving you 60 pounds of white rice every market day... B- b-but... That can't be considered white rice, it's just powdered rice chaff... A lot of Work Units and families alike buy it to feed their pigs... Other people feed it to their pigs that are then sold to the state... But you? Your powdered rice chaff... ...is turned into a commodity to fatten yourself, right? In total, Grain Distribution Manager Gu Yanshan sold you... What? No! Section Chief Li... That's correct? Isn't it? Don't be nervous! I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this... I've got things to do, so I can't stay any longer... The reports from the provincial, county, and municipal Party Committees... The reports from the provincial, county, and municipal Party Committees... ...on class struggle in the Four Cleanups Movement are now concluded... We now move to the second item on the meeting agenda... Is the Capitalist Rightist Qin Shutian present? Here! Come up here! Get up there! Stand here! This here is... Hibiscus Town's own, the famous Qin Shutian... - Also known as Crazy Qin! - Yes, yes, that's me... - Be serious! Stand still! - Yes, sir... Looking at this class enemy, do you really feel hate for him? I especially want to ask the Party Cadres present here... Do you consider Qin Shutian ... fragrant... or foul? This man made a name for himself in 1957... ...collecting folksongs and rewriting them into antifeudal plays... Then he launched a ferocious attack on socialism and the Party... He is a Rightist who has committed grave criminal acts... ...and was sent back to his hometown to reform himself through labor... But the strange thing about this class enemy is... ...he actually possesses authority over the entire town's propaganda program! On the streets, on the walls, in the market... All those revolutionary slogans come from the brush of this reactionary Rightist! Qin Shutian, tell us... These glorious and privleged tasks... who delegated them to you? Glorious tasks? Privleged tasks? Crazy Qin, speak honestly! It was... um... Oh, it was the superiors, the superiors... Look at your stammering! You're hiding the truth! - Step down! - Go! There are cadres among us... who cannot tell friend from enemy... They have forfeited their class standing! We want to ask those cadres... On which side are you going to put your ass? Huh? Comrades, low and middle-class peasant comrades... It gets even stranger... Not long ago there was a small food stall vendor that erected a brand-new house... Some people have noticed... ...that compared to the two biggest stores in town before the Liberation... ...theirs is even grander! Speaking of which... In the past 2 years and 9 months, this small food stall vendor... ...has accumulated an income of 6,600 yuan! Six thousand six hundred! Some of our own cadres have supported her on this road toward capitalism! Quiet down! Everyone quiet down! Quiet quiet quiet! Time to visit the toilet! We need to think of a way to get rid of the new house... No matter if we have to sell it for only a couple hundred kuai... Who has fated us to live in this tumbledown shack? Nonsense! You spineless good-for-nothing! From morning til night, we work ourselves to death... Wearing down the pot handle to a nub, til it has a hole in the bottom... Who are we exploiting? What crime have we committed? And you're already talking about selling the house! Yuyin... I was just thinking out loud... Our family affairs... are still yours to decide... Whatever you think, we'll do... Oh my heavens! You stupid thing... You don't even know to say something when you're hurt? Yuyin... With you by my side, I'm not afraid of anything! Even if I have to beg for food, I'm not afraid! Yuyin, don't think I have the courage of a mouse... To keep our new house... ...I'll even kill someone if you tell me to! Do you have a death wish? Don't talk such crazy foolishness! Listen to what have to tell you... There really isn't any way out of this! Oh you... We could sell the new house, or we could fight them to the death... But look how scared you are after just having a meeting tonight... If something more serious happens in the days to come, how could you bear it? All they can do is kill me! You! Hey Branch Secretary... Tonight half of what that County Section Chief said was meant to attack you... I'm not sure if you were clever enough to pick up on that... She's wondering just what you and your tofu-peddling "sister" are up to... Did you throw away your class postion for that Crazy Qin? The woman Section Chief came this close to saying your name... That tofu woman doesn't act like she's single or married... How about you stop your mouth from farting? You?! I've had quite enough of the stink in the air tonight! Don't try to act like a hero now in front of me! If you got the ability, why don't you throw your weight around out there? - You itching for a beating, eh? - What can you do? - You bitch! I didn't even hit you! - Serves you right! - Bitch! I'm not through with you! - You try it! You're the one who put your ass on that side... Hey! Come over here... We can't keep this 1500 kuai here... I'll see if I can give it to Brother Mangeng to hold it for us... If we keep it here, it will only cause trouble... Mangeng? Did you not hear that woman Section Chief? She was attacking him... Don't be scared... He's in the Party, and he is a veteran... What can she do to him? Besides... he's my sworn brother. OK... Yuyin... I think you'd better go away until this blows over... I've got some distant relatives in Guangxi... Be quiet! Brother Mangeng, help us... Fifth Sister... You are all Five Categories Elements... Targets of the dictatorship of the proletariat... Be conscientious, and don't make trouble... This week you should think about how you can improve... Then come back next week to make your reports, understand? Yes, Sir! What are you looking at, huh? Hmph, look at her! Hey! Hey... What are you doing, huh? Listen up, you'd better not see that Sister Hibiscus so much... The day will come when she'll make a criminal of you! Are you finished? Eating, sleeping, these are the important things... These days will pass... Movements! Movements... Movements are just temporary... What the hell do you know about it? Sleep, sleep... Quit smoking out the mosquitos... The life of a mosquito is not easy, either... Aiyo, what's the matter with you? Tell me what's on your mind... - You know... Yuyin is my sworn sister... - You mean? Hmph! She and Guigui are honest folk... You heard Li Guoxiang's implications... They are targets of this campaign. Hu Yuyin is still holding onto 1500 kuai... How do you know about your sworn sister's secret money? She's afraid it will be confiscated... - What does that have to with us? Hmph! - Hey, listen to me... After the meeting Hu Yuyin entrusted that 1500 kuai to me... ...and asked me to hide it for her. Did you take it? Where did you put it? Upstairs in the regular place... Oh great! You're just going to let disaster into this house! Ruin has struck this family! You're such an ingrate! I've always treated you well! - You're completely taken in by that vixen! - What are you shouting for? Stop wailing! Then explain things to me clearly... Just what kind of relationship is there between you and that fox spirit? Am I your wife, or is she? I'm gonna beat that stinking mouth of yours! Quit spewing such rubbish! Fine! Hit me! Go ahead! I've given you three daughters, and you want to get rid of me, right? You wanted to ditch me long ago... Mine can't compare with her fresh, white skin! You ingrate! Hit me! Beat me to death and be done with me! Go be with your fresh wife! You heard what that woman Section Chief said at the meeting... You could go down! You don't want this family anymore, right? You still want to bring your sweetheart's illicit money here, you ingrate... Fine, you want to drag me and the kids down with you when you drown... Make me your scapegoat to go sit in a prison cell! That's not going to happen! - What are you doing? - Don't mind me! You can't stop me! If you don't turn it in... If you don't... I will... - Where are going to go? - If you turn it in, if you won't, I'll do it... Turn it in? Turn it in? Give it back! You won't do it, will you? If you don't, I'll report it to the Work Section Chief! You wouldn't dare! You bitch! Like a dog on the fucking street, I'll beat you to death! Anay, I don't want to fucking live anymore, I... Mangeng! Mangeng! Mangeng! I'm begging you! Mangeng! If you won't do it for my sake, think about your three daughters! You need to turn that money in, Mangeng... I'm begging you... Oh god... Nowadays unless you trample on others, they'll trample on you! I can't take it! My sister was born with skin like white silver... Her melon seed-shaped face is loved to death... Oh, loved to death... As she walks down the road, they all fall in love... When she sits at home, they all come over... Oh, they all come over... You need to consider this very seriously... Either you keep your Party membership... Or you take that girl who opened a food stall as your wife... My sister was born with skin like white silver... Her melon seed-shaped face is loved to death... Oh, loved to death... As she walks down the road, they all fall in love... When she sits at home, they all come over... Oh, they all come over... Old Gu! How is your thinking coming along? You will be suspended from your position and must confess your crime... This is the decision of the County Party Committee and the County Grain Bureau... You're an old comrade... I used to respect you so deeply... I never thought the problem could be this serious... It's very possible that you will be made an example of in this campaign... Hmph! No matter how serious the problem, as long as you come clean to the Party... ...it shouldn't be difficult to resolve... As for me... I have no prejudice against Hibiscus Town... Nor do I have any prejudice against you... You see... I made a point of talking to you alone today... ...with no other comrades present... Gu Yanshan... I've got some numbers I want you to listen to... According to our examination of your accounts... Since the second half of 1961, over the next two years and nine months... You sold to that New Bourgeois Element Hu Yuyin a total of... Is this accurate? More than ten thousand pounds? Not a small amount... That was just powdered rice chaff, not rice from the state storehouse! No matter if it was powdered rice chaff or white rice... As Grain Distribution Director you issued more than ten thousand pounds, right? - When did you go work in the paddies? - Hey... If it wasn't the state storehouse where did it come from? Didn't you make the report to the Bureau? Who gave you so much authority? It wasn't just her I sold to... It's all in the official accounts! - I didn't profit one extra cent! - It was that clean, huh? You didn't profit one extra cent... This I can perhaps believe... However... a bachelor like yourself... ...should at least make a bachelor's profit... What bachelor's profit? Don't act so naive... What cat doesn't want to eat raw fish? That rice tofu beauty... she's the Xi Shi of Hibiscus Town! You!? You mean to say... I had relations with her? Wouldn't this kind of thing be right up her alley? Wasn't her mother a prostitute? Section Chief Li... How could I have had relations with her? How could I have? How could I have? Me? Me? Li Guoxiang! You! You... you... Go tell your Work to all come in here! I... I'll face all of you! I'll take my pants off for you to see! Gu Yanshan! What kind of pervert are you? You dirty old bachelor... Now you want to take off your pants? Fine! I'll allow this! I'll convene a meeting of the whole village for you! You can face the whole crowd and take your pants off! I... You have forced me to this! You... you... I was wounded in the war! You... I'm impotent... I'm impotent... Old Gu... Sit... Have a seat... You and Hu Yuyin may not have carried on an affair... But Li Mangeng isn't impotent, is he? They have passionately sworn loyalty to each other, ever wonder why that is? You... Hu Yuyin... Li Mangeng ... and that Qin Shutian... Economically, politically, ideologically... You want me to ignore the countless links between you all? Your little group here... Collaborating both within and outside the Party! You're running the whole politcs and economy of Hibiscus Town! It's become a counter-ideology! What? Actually, it is a... ...a clique! A clique? What are you doing? Just a cough... it itches... You still want to kill the Work Unit Chief? Where is that young girl from? She's married to my relative, she's just visiting... What class is her family? Low, definitely low... Does she have papers from her commune or work unit? Did you... for her... have her residency transferred? She's a relative, what papers does she need just to visit? Well... without papers she cannot stay here for very long, OK? Exhibition of Class Education in Hibiscus Town Posted by the Work Unit of Hibiscus Town May, 196 Uncle! Aiya, you're back looking for Old Gu? He got caught up in their investigation of you and now he's locked up! Sister, sister... Is Brother Mangeng home? I'm begging you, don't come here looking for him again... You've brought trouble on him... and trouble on this home! The bosses sent him to the county seat for self-criticism and reeducation... He left with just his bedding roll... What about my husband?

In the future it will belong to you lower and middle-class peasants... I was a hired farmhand... In the old society, we hired farmhands were the most exploited by capitalism... What? Capitalism? Before liberation, China hadn't yet reached the capitalist stage... They're all reactionaries, and they were all oppressing me! That's all I know... Hey, the rain stopped! - Chief, shouldn't we get going? - Let's go... - You want to change clothes first? - No need... Hey, Li Guoxiang!

It's about the situation with the campaign... This is information about the overthrow of Liu Shaoqi... Paint a large slogan... Write... "Overthrow Li Guoxiang"! She's done for after this... She relied on her uncle in the county office... ...to get her appointment as Chair of the People's Commune! You think I did the same to get to be Branch Secretary? Hard to say... You are a good guy... You turned in that 1500 kuai of Hu Yuyin's and secured your Party membership... Look at Gu Yanshan, just a washed-up drunk now... This clerk's position of yours... You've been at it for two years now? Movements, campaigns... you don't understand these... Movements are great... In the future when I'm a County Committee Secretary...

Believe me, I know it well! Time to get up... OK, let me do the sweeping... Clerk Li, what instructions do you have now? Branch Secretary Wang is back! So he's back... I thought you were going to announce we couldn't buy liquor... Huh? We can't buy liquor? That's right, no more liquor sales... Welcome Branch Secretary Wang's Return from Expedition Loyalty Brach Secretary Wang is back! - The Branch Secretary is back! - What? Aiyo, you're back! Branch Secretary Wang, your trip must have really opened your eyes! You went to Beijing, right? You must be tired... You've been gone a couple months, eh? You work too hard! Branch Secretary, I have a report on the situation here during your absence... Ai, what's the rush? We'll arrange a big meeting soon... I want to pass on the scriptures of the liberated revolutionary areas! Such a rich experience, enough to last us several lifetimes! Wow, several lifetimes? There was one thing, I couldn't have even dreamed it... - What was it? - The whole nation is dancing now! - Dancing? - Dancing!? You must be tired! Let me be the first raise a glass to you! - Tired? Impossible! - Branch Secretary Wang, sit a bit... They treated our touring group of peasant representatives so well... Everywhere we went they took us by car and picked us up... You know what else? An exclusive traincar! Exclusive traincar? What's an exclusive traincar? Is an exclusive traincar a special kind of dance? - Don't interrupt him! - You're so unsophisticated... At the meeting in a bit, I'll teach you all how to dance... You have to learn it right! It can show whether you are loyal or not... Branch Secretary, show us a little bit now! How about it? Yes! Show off your stuff! Come over here, we want to see it! What the hell are you laughing at? This is a solemn ritual! - Oh, Director, you're back... - Great, great... What's going on? Huh? Clerk Li... - I just said I had a report... - What's going on? What's with Li Guoxiang? What has happened with her? The campaign has changed quickly... Comrade Li Guoxiang was exonerated by the higher-ups... ...and made a part of the county leadership ranks... And now she's a member of the County Revolutionary Committee... - Also... - There's more? She's the director of the Commune Revolutionary Committee... It's the same as before... She's has come to Hibiscus Town to improve it and gain experience... And to seize... seize the revolution! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Fucking hell! Bastard! - I'll still be living at my old place - OK, we'll drop by to see you I don't want to see anyone for now, I have to undertake some serious research... The movement in Hibiscus Town needs to be seized and revised... Down with the Rich Peasant Element Hu Yuyin! Circled together, we sing our song... We sing of our sisters who must part... Today our song will see her off... Tomorrow no one will be here to sing with us... Today our song will see her off... Tomorrow no one will be here to sing with us... Time to get up... You're up early today... Crazy Qin... don't come calling me anymore... I... I... This life of mine... ...is all because of you... Because of you! Those songs you wrote... Why did you insist on singing them at my wedding? They were antisocial... You're a devil! And you've turned into a ghost... I had no idea how much harm could come from asking you to write those words! Why did you insist on writing those antisocial couplet lines that hurt us? It killed Guigui... And has tormented me... ...until I also became a ghost, too! When the day breaks... ...the ghosts... can no longer come out... - Is Director Li in? - No! She... where did she go? Director Li is seizing the revolution! I'm a revolutionary worker with a report... Hey, listen! Director Li is busy inside... When you see her, whatever you do don't let her know I told you, OK? Go on, tell me! Didn't I already tell you? It's me, Director Li... I don't care who it is! I have a report on the situation in town... I'm Wang Qiushe... I don't have time! Hey, did you see her? Um, yeah, I saw her... I mean, no, she's busy, really busy... Hey, let me tell you, you need to take a bath! Aren't you ashamed to let Director Li see you so filthy? Hmph! Hey, why don't you play with your kids and get them to go to sleep? Are you deaf? I'm talking to you and you're not even listening! Hmph! When other people talk to you... ...you're suddenly full of energy and can run all over the place! Why are you still giving me a hard time? I can't think straight in my own home... I've asked Old Gu to come over... Compared to that Wang Qiushe, Li Guoxiang is better for you... - Old Gu! - Sister! Clerk Li, where did all that energy you had during the day go off to? Where's your liquor jar? Bring it out! You old fiend! Nowadays it's no good to keep private things hidden... It's a serious offense... We must fight selfishness and criticize revisionism! Old Gu... I wish I were able to live like you... Huh? You want to live like me? It's not easy... You need conscience for one thing... I'll pour... Drink... Yuyin! Yuyin! Yuyin! Yuyin... Yuyin? Yuyin... How did your illness get so serious? In all of Hibiscus Town... The one who has it the worst is that suffering widow... Can't you see that? I made a clear class distinction between us... I was stupid... I was too young and naive... You, stupid? The Party wouldn't allow us to be together... You're not that stupid! I'm not that drunk... I still remember... You turned over Hu Yuyin's money to the Work Unit! She was at the bottom of a well, and you still threw rocks at her! You have no heart! - Don't bring up her name with me! - I will bring it up! Nowadays they're ready to eat her alive! I didn't have a choice! They only gave me two days to make up my mind... I was up against the Party and the Work Unit! They wanted to expel me, but I needed the Party! I have a wife and children... I would fight to the death! To the death... Actually... ...as soon as you said Sister Hu's name ... my heart began to hurt... It hurts! She became the wife of a Rich Peasant, something inhuman and evil! Old Gu... The name Hu Yuyin... Don't say it again... don't say it anymore! Come on... drink! Yuyin... Drink this, it's hot... Don't come in here! Drink it, it's hot... I don't want you to come here! I... I wish I were dead! Don't talk like that... In these times we only have our own selves to value each other... Your heart is not yet completely black... There is still a bit of conscience... Drink! Huh, empty? It's finished... It's finished... It's finished! It's finished! It's not finished! It's finished! It's not finished! Ah, it's finished! It's not finished! Not finished! Not finished! It's not finished! It's not finished! It's finished... It's not finished! Not finished! Don't be scared... It's just Old Gu, that's all... Not finished! Our hearts are not dead yet... If you've got the guts... Come out here! Huh? You coming? Come on! Get out here! I want to fight you! Kill! It's finished... It's not finished... Yuyin... I should go... Lay down... Get some sleep... Stay in bed tomorrow... I can sweep the streets by myself... Wait for me to bring you something to eat... Sleep, OK? I'm going now... Who is it? You? It's so late... Director Li, I've come to make a report... You work too hard, Director Li... It's snowing outside, the road from the county seat must be hard-going... About... the status of the movement... What do you have? I came to report of the conditions for class struggle in Hibiscus Town... Um, no, I came to report on my own thoughts... Branch Secretary Wang, you are too polite... How could I dare listen to a report on your own thoughts? I've already been taken down once... Director Li, I... I have no education or learning, I only know how to shout slogans... It, it was all just parroting other people... I don't believe in blaming anyone for speaking out... - I'm a beast! - Don't act so undignified... I really am a beast... Without your backing, I couldn't enter the Party, or become Branch Secretary... ...or been able to turn my life around... I'm ashamed, I was ungrateful... Everyday I am filled with regret! You have a good memory... I've forgotten all that... The past is in the past now... I'm not interested in hearing about your regret... Director Li, I know... how kind and forgiving you are... Something about what you are wearing today... ...looks different than before... I cleaned up specially... ...to come make my report... Director Li, there are some new developments... Last night while you were gone, Gu Yanshan was cursing you on the street... He called you a bitch! And cursed you to attack the movement! Old Wang... We must make sure Gu Yanshan and them don't return to power... ...and renew their control over the town! Do you understand what I mean? You are alright... not bad at all! Sit sit sit, sit... Here you are... Drink! Old Wang... Old Wang... If you are capable of withstanding the trials of this campaign... I am prepared to help you become... ...a full-time cadre! Director Li, I... I've wronged you! Director Li... I'm so sorry! From today on, I am yours... I am your devoted servant! You didn't wash your neck... Who is it? Wang Qiushe! Rice tofu? Eat... You're feeling better now? Then I'll stay for a moment and then go... No... Eat, while it's hot... Eat first... I need to go see Guigui again... OK... Actually... I don't think that sweeping the street is an undignified task at all... The key is how you handle the broom... Come, let me show you... Aiyo, I can't sweep! I really can't, really! Give it a try! Watch me, come on... ...5- 2- 3, right, very smart... Right! Sweep, and sweep... What are you doing? Come here... Branch Secretary Wang, you are such a hard worker... Gently... This is me when I was 14... ...and 12... ...and 19... This is a photo of when I won a singing prize... After this one, I haven't had any more pictures taken... This is my mother... Now she is your mother-in-law... This is my father... and your father-in-law... Are you OK? What's wrong? What is it? We have a child... Really? Really? Yuyin... Ai, sit there! Let's get married, Yuyin! Who are we to get married... Will they allow it? - Our crimes aren't so serious that... - Keep it down! Our crimes aren't so serious that they can keep us from marrying... Where is the rule that says Five Categories Elements can't marry? Brother Shutian... Someone's coming, quick! Are you tired? Lay down a bit... Be careful... Confession of Crimes What? You and that Rich Peasant's wife Hu Yuyin are applying to get married? Um, yes, Branch Secretary Wang, that is my request... You... have had relations with her? Branch Secretary Wang... I can see it is no use trying to hide from you in this matter... - Don't bullshit me! - Yes yes, that's bullshit... - When did it start? - I can't remember exactly... I'll confess, I'll confess... Didn't the authorities assign us to sweep the streets together? You know that I'm a bachelor, and she was single... Spending so much time together, who wouldn't have proper intentions? How many times have you done it? We don't dare do that, not a chance, it would never allow it, we don't dare! We are properly in love... - Properly in love? - Yes yes yes... You are both targets of the proletarian dictatorship... For Five Categories Elements, there is no marriage! Branch Secretary Wang... we... we are wicked, we are rotten... ...but are we not after all human? You can call us a cock and hen, a boar and sow, a dog and a bitch... ...and yet you wouldn't keep them from getting married! Crazy Qin, Crazy Qin... Don't say such ugly words! Confessing can get you lenience... Today I am feeling magnanimous... We'll have to look into it first, then turn it over to the commune for approval... Whether or not they approve it is far from certain... Branch Secretary Wang... I also want to beg of you, be generous, be generous... Our situation depends completely on your good word... To tell the truth... We already... have... You have? Yes, we have a situation... What? An enemy of the proletariat is still getting action! Get the hell out of here! Tomorrow you are going to write matching couplets on white paper! And you're going to hang them on your door yourself! Ai, get a look at this! Why hang couplets on white? Isn't that unlucky? So many people, eh? What is going on? Ai, what is happening here? A pair of white couplets! Secretary Wang made him hang them... "Black husband and wife, a devil's nest!" How inauspicious! Never seen couplets on white, at least not unless anybody died! They've hit rock bottom! This is really unlucky! This is too much! I've never seen anything like it! Look how serious he is! He still wants to make it straight... Hey, what's the matter? Don't cry! Ai, you... This is a good thing, and you're still crying! Sometimes, this is the authorities' intent... You have to experience it deeply and completely... Doesn't it say "black husband and wife"? It doesn't matter if its black husband and wife, or red, or white... In the end, it's still husband and wife! Most of these kind of couplets are meant to be a public announcement... We are husband and wife! I'll go open the door... It's nothing, wait here... Who is it? Open the door... This marriage didn't have a matchmaker... How can it count? I saw you sneaking around, busying yourselves all day... Buying wine, buying fish... And I thought... I must go drink a cup at their wedding! I was afraid if I didn't come and drink... no one else would dare! Actually... I will serve as matchmaker for you... So your marriage can be real... But your real matchmakers... ...are the brooms in your hands, and the stones that make the street... Oh, this is grenadine syrup, you two should drink it for harmony and affection I brought some baijiu for myself! I also brought a gift for you two... Don't refuse it... These last few years, whenever anyone in town gets married... I give them this kind of gift... I... hope you will soon be blessed with a son... Now that you are husband and wife... it doesn't matter if you are red or black... All that matters is the next generation! Director Gu... You must let me bow down to you! Because of me... Because of the rice chaff you were unjustly framed! You, an old cadre from the north... If all cadres could be like you, these days would know peace! I cannot repay all that you have done in this life... In the next life I will slave as an ox or horse to repay you! Get up, get up... Don't talk like that... Come on, let's drink and enjoy ourselves, drink! Yuyin, listen... This wedding... needs a happy song... It's an old custom! Sing! Sing! Yuyin, sing! Confession of Crimes They'll stop at nothing! Flouting the dictatorship of the proletariat like that! - Tie him up! Take him away! - Hurry! Strengthen the Great Proletarian Revolution's Victorious Achievements! The County Public Security and Military Affairs Committee announces: Convicted Rightist and Anti-revolutionary Element Qin Shutian... ...Is to serve a term of ten years... Convicted Reactionary Rich Peasant Hu Yuyin... ...is to serve a term of three years... Due to her pregnancy, she will serve her term outside prison... The revolutionary masses of Hibiscus Town will supervise her labor... ...and observe her behavior! The Great Proletarian Revolution... has achieved great success! A handful of class enemies are in a constant state of anxiety... They are certain to jump out to make trouble and cause destruction... Live on, like a beast of burden, live on... Live on! Like a beast of burden, live on! Yuyin... Director Gu... It's coming soon! I'm over thirty this year... Having my first now is really difficult! Stay with me, I'll be dead soon... Neither of us will be able to make it! I'll be right back! Stop! Stop! Stop! Your wife's age is advanced, it's difficult to deliver... We have to do a Caesarean, as her family, please sign here... Surgery Room For a new China, advance! For a new China, advance! It is like a ship far out at sea whose mast-head... ...can already be seen from the shore... It is like the morning sun whose shimmering rays are already visible... It is like a child about to be born moving restlessly in its mother's womb... Let us raise both of our hands... ...and welcome him! How sweet... What name will you be giving to this healthy child? Gu Jun... Which Jun? The Jun for "army," as in the People's Liberation Army... Gu Jun... Oh, Comrade Hu Yuyin, have a seat... According to the directives of the Central and Provincial Committees... ...and approved by the District and County Research Committees... ...it has been resolved to rectify past mistaken judgements. It has been decided that your new house will be returned to you... And your 1500 kuai will also be returned to you... Do you have any further requests? You've given back my house... You've given back my money... Give me back my husband! Give me back my husband! Give me back my husband... Give back... my... husband... Young Gao... I spent many a year working right here at Hibiscus Town! I've heard that, it was that business of many years ago... It really is true that important people are forgetful... You must be busy! Qin... Qin Shutian! Right right right, Qin Shutian... Also known as Crazy Qin! My specialty was sweeping streets, and I did a pretty good job of it! During the Great Cultural Revolution, I was lucky enough to get married... My wife is called Hu Yuyin! Comrade Qin Shutian... Through these years... you have suffered a lot... Comrade Qin Shutian! I've not heard those words together very often... Your rehabilitation case was also signed off on by me... Yes, the official procedures are indispensable in your work... Director Li, get in the car! It's all in the past now... Perhaps... I can help you again sometime... It seems... you haven't gotten married yet... I'm on my way to the county seat to get married now... Ohh... Great! Settle down peacefully, and learn to pass the days like the common people! Don't always be so hard on them... Their lives... are simple... but difficult! Aiya, it that...? Hey, who are you? I've never seen him... - Who is it? - Aiya, he's never been through here! - Who is that? - I don't know... Junjun, why haven't you gone home? Your father has come back... Your father has come back! Mom, mom! - What are you doing? - He's come back! Oh? Who has come back? He's come back! Garlic flowers blossom, oh, so soft and tiny... I keep my lover in my heart, oh, even in poverty... Just the two of us, oh, our affection is enough... Tea brewed with cold water will diffuse slowly... So he's finally come back... Poor ill-fated Junjun... What are you doing still standing here, go inside! Mom! Junjun... This is your father! How come you never came back? - What's everyone looking at? - Hu Yuyin's husband is back! Hu Family Rice Tofu I haven't eaten such delicious rice tofu for so long! Hey, two bowls of rice tofu! - Yuyin! - Coming! - Here you are! - You guys made it! Give out a little more... Old Gu, here's some extra... - Ai, its really delicious! - That's right! - How much for another bowl? - No charge... It's our fifteen year-old custom... If its no charge, everyone will love to eat it! This rice tofu of yours tastes better and better! It's all due to strict training from the wife! Comrade, let me see your business permit... Business permit! - Mangeng is here! - Brother Mangeng... Big Momma! - Yuyin, don't be too hard on Shutian... - Of course not! - What's the matter? - He said I shouldn't be too hard on you... That's right, Mangeng is correct... Shutian, the higher-ups have asked us in the town... if you will return to your old profession in the county government? Head of the County Cultural Office! Crazy, I mean, Shutian, congratulations! I already knew... Sit down, sit down! This is... This is all ancient history from twenty years ago... I forgot all that long ago, I can't do it... - What do you mean? Don't you know? - Shutian... You've been rehabilitated, you can be reinstated... You're such an accomplished man! I'm only accomplished as a man when I'm together with Yuyin... Ghosts can't carry on romance, can they? Yuyin... Mangeng, I'm serious, this street doesn't look as clean as when I was here... No one knows the cracks between these street stones like I do... The way I see it... From now on... I want to return to sweeping! I'm not going anywhere... Loyalty Time for a movement! Time for a movement! Lunatic! Stinking and filthy! Time for a movement! - Don't be afraid, it's nothing... - Time for a movement! So Wang Qiushe has lost his mind... Times like these... are really interesting... The one called "Crazy" isn't crazy at all... While the ones who weren't crazy... turn out mad... Without campaigns to launch, he's lost his mind... Go on! I'll hit you! Get out of here! Yuyin... Give him a full bowl of rice tofu. We can spare it... Time for a movement! We need a movement... There should be a movement! Unless our attitudes change, unless we stay on guard... ...what he's saying may still have a kind of logic to it... Assemble after dinner... for a movement! Time for a movement! Time for a movement! Time for a movement! Time for a movement! Time for a movement! The End
