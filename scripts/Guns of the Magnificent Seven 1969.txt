Senor Quintero... ...for three years, they have heard nothing but talk. Now, when are we going to do something? When are we going to get the soldiers off our necks? Soon, my friend. Soon. But first, we must grow strong. In one week I go to Sonora to meet with the revolutionary council. If I can show them the support of the people... ...and the young fighters in the hills... ...they promise that the generals sympathetic to our cause... ...will come over to our side. The presidente will run before our strength. Then you will be free to live as men, and not as animals. - And what about Lobero? - He is a bandit and a thief. It's hard to respect the law when you feel the heel of its boot on your back. I'm not sure that what Lobero wants from the revolution is the same as we want. But he says he wants to help. And he has many guns. Do you trust him? Only his guns. For the revolution I would make a bargain with the devil... ...so why not with Lobero? Let him join us. Perhaps, after we win, he will change. Oh. It is time for me to go. Senor Quintero. Please, be careful, huh? You took a big chance just coming here. In these days, one takes a chance every time he wakes up in the morning. (gunshots) Quintero! We are waiting! It's Diego. They're all over the place. Benito? - Is he dead? - He's dead. - I told you we should have brought guns. - Guns? What guns? (Diego) Quintero! It is useless to resist. We must wait for our time. Take this. It will help. Somehow, I don't know how... ...we will be together, eh? If I live. You will live. (Diego) Quintero! I do not like to be kept waiting! Look at your leader. El palomito. The little dove who would be an eagle! Take a good look. You will not see him again. This... this is who you follow, but you go nowhere. He talks... oh, how he talks, but he does not fight. Must we teach you again and again - to resist the president only brings death? Will you never learn? Tie them up. They have done nothing. Why make them suffer because of me? Perhaps you are right. They do nothing on the farms. They will do nothing in prison. We are short on rations, so why feed stupid mouths? (yelling) (yelling) (anguished cries) (snoring) Lobero. (in Spanish) Lobero. Wake up, man. Lobero. - It's me, Maximiliano. - Hm? - What happened? - Quintero's been captured. Argh! The little dove is in the rathole! (gunshots) I told you not to let him come. Nobody listens to Lobero. Now we will have to get him out. Tomorrow. But every time we do, we don't. But every time we do, we don't what? Every time we go in, we don't come back. Two brothers I have lost, trying to get your uncle out. He's right, Lobero. We're going to need some help. Need help... I have men. I have guns. - That's not enough. - It's not enough? - You have a plan? - I know someone who can help us. Someone who can help us. Who is this great genius, this great man? I have never seen him. All I know is that he's a friend and his name is Chris. And he will help us because he love us? - No, no. For money. - For money? - How much money? - $600. $600? - American? - American. You have the money? What do you think, Miguel? - I think... - Ah! I don't care what you think. OK. All right. Maximiliano... ...you go, but you better come back... ...with the cannons and the guns and the dynamite and the whole shooting match. Hang him! You got anything to say, stranger? I said it all at my trial. You didn't believe me then. String him up! Kill the horse thief! You, uh... you wanna know my name before you hang me? Not particularly. Just your last words. - I demand a re-count. - We've been all through that before. It was your word against the Garrett boys, three of the finest men I know... ...born and bred right here in this town. Three of the finest liars you know? Stealing a man's horse in this country is worse than stealing his wife. There's been too much of this thing going on and I'm going to put a stop to it. Horse stealing or wife stealing, Judge? Let's get on with it. I got some steers want brandin'. All right, boys. Get on with it. I'm a reasonable man, Judge. Give him a re-count. All right, Coley. Whatever you say. Everybody in favour of hanging him, say "aye". - Aye! - Against? No. And who says no? - Me. - Just who are you to say no? Who do you have to be to say no to a rigged court... ...stretching the neck of some poor slob? And what would you suggest? Well, she's just another horse. She's nothin' special. She... he could be anybody's. This man says it's his, huh? This man says it's his. - One of them's a liar. - You better prove I'm a liar. - I can't do that. - Then who can? The horse. It's all right with me, Judge. Take the horse out in the middle of the street. Come on, horse. Come on. Come on, horse. Come to Daddy. Come on, Billy-boy. Come on. Billy-boy. Come on, Billy-boy. Come on, Billy-boy. Yeah, come on, fella. Come on, Billy-boy. Come over here. Come on. Come on, Billy-boy. Come to Daddy. That's it. Come on, Billy-boy. Come on. Come on, fella. Come on. Yeah, attaboy. Yeah, yeah. (Judge) Well, that's fair and square and good enough for me. Case dismissed. We'd better get outta here before they wise up. (Coley) Hold it, you two! I'm overrulin' the judge. There's somethin' real snaky goin' on. I know you, Chris. A lot of people know you. Mostly sheriffs. That's my horse. I want him. And I'm gonna have him. I'll count to three. They'll draw on two. One... ...two... Let's go. That's my horse! Let's get after them! Is that your horse? Nope. Coley's the thief. Stole my horse in Dodge. Rigged faro game. So you stole his, huh? Yeah. Well, that's only fair. You didn't really have to call me a poor slob, did you? (Chris laughs) Name's Keno. I like that better than "poor slob". I know you from someplace. Fresno, Laramie, St Joe. You ever been a lawman? - I just got out. - For what? No questions. No questions. (horse approaches) Hello, Chris. It sure seems to be my day for strangers. Oh, you were magnificent. Both of you. There you were, standing on the scaffold... ...alone and friendless... ...and the crowd is yelling "Kill him! Kill him!" But you stand there, ready to die. Proud and defiant and unafraid. And suddenly there's a voice. "No." And Chris, Chris steps forward. As cool as the other side of the pillow. One man against a thousand. Chris, I'm so glad I follow you. My cousin said to me "Find a man. He's called Chris, and he will help you." - Who's your cousin? - In Mexico everyone is a cousin. And all the cousins are in trouble now. Big trouble. Angel Quintero has been captured. He is our only leader. With him we are something. Without him we are nothing. He's in prison. We need your help. - Have you tried to get him out yourself? - We have the will but not the way. Diego, the prison comandante - he's a crazy one, and our hands are tied. Un gato con guante no caza raton. That's: A cat with... with mittens doesn't catch the rat. Will you help us? I have money. I have lots of money. Here, it's all yours. - $600. - American? It's American. This prison, is it a big one? It's the Cave of the Rats. It's like a fort. I've heard of it. I'd need help. More men. We have the men. Quick with the guns, but slow with the brains. Six men. Not enough to cause suspicion, just enough to do the job. Six men. $100 a man. You like? Yeah... ...I like. - It's a deal. - Thanks. Oh, and Chris? Chris, can I fight with you? Oh, it's not for the money - I could not take it - but it's for Quintero. Not on the basis of what you did against Keno. Oh, but I'm young, I'm strong, I'm angry. And I will learn. Besides, my cousin says that seven is a lucky number for you, no? - What's your name? - Maximiliano Bienvenido O'Leary. Why do you people always have such long names? I don't know. Perhaps it's because we all have such short lives. Well, Chris? Can I fight with you? - Welcome, Max. - Thank you, Chris. Cave-in! Cave-in! (groaning) We'll get you outta here. We'll get you out. We'll get you out. Hold on, we'll get you outta here. Get him out! Get him out! Ah! That's great. That's gonna cost us nothin' but time and money. I told you it might collapse. The surface charge was too much. You're all back and no brains, boy. So you stick your damn advice. The company shouldn't hire your kind. Pick up your card and get your butt back up in the trees where you belong... (Chris) He ain't worth killin', Cassie. I wish I was as sure of that as you are! (boss) You're through, you hear? You're through! Get the hell off of this property before I call the sheriff! Go on! - What the hell are you doin' here? - I'm lookin' for you. - What's on your mind? - I've got somethin' going. I need ya. - Who is this? - Name's Keno. This is a rough go, huh, Cassie? Yeah. If I hang around here much longer, I'll end up in jail. Wouldn't you rather blow one up? - For money or for laughs? - About as much as you'd make in a year. $100. Not many laughs. I don't work here no more. I guess I might... ...take you up on that. (laughs) Chris, how are ya? It's good to see ya. Long time. I'm sorry about your hat, stranger. - Yeah, so am I. - This is my friend, Keno. Well, then you're no stranger. Levi. Come on in. Get in there. Well, sit down, sit down. This is my... This is my wife. She's a good woman, but she don't like strangers, just me. So I notice. Kinda surprise you a little bit that I got these shots left in me? - You didn't wait very long to fire 'em. - I didn't have much time. Supper's just about ready. We're havin' beans. - Hope you like beans. It's all we're havin'. - Fine, fine. Milk for the kids. No whisky. We can't afford it. - Land does look a little tough and dry. - It's like jerky. Dry well don't help none. - Why don't you dig a new one? - No time. I gotta feed the family first. Would $100 help? - What's the action? - Prison break. In Mexico. No, Chris. I've packed all that in. I do my talkin' with my... ...mouth now, mostly. Besides, I'm too old. It's time for a-settin' and a-lookin'. Most of the time, anyway. $100 would dig you a new well. Buy you a lot of staples. I ain't as fast as I used to be. You're probably a lot smarter. And you look just as tough. (chuckles) Well, what do you say we find out the way we used to? One... two... three. I think you're just bein' kind to me, Chris. In more ways than one. No, I've got guns. But nobody handles a knife like you do. - (wife) Beans, Mr Morgan? - Beans, Mrs Morgan. I'll think it over. (belly-dancing music) (applause) Buffalo Ben, is he? Never heard of him. (laughter) It ain't all that hard to shoot at somethin' that don't shoot back. I don't like rebs. I think I just might shoot the buttons right off of that mangy uniform. (Chris) Now you better get your friend to the doctor. (man) It's just a part of the show, folks. Just a part of the show. Step right over here and meet God and Billy Joe Hatfield for only ten cents. One thin dime, the tenth part of a dollar. Yes, sir, folks. The one and only Billy Joe... ...direct from a colossal and successful tour... Hello, Chris. Don't you remember me? (Chris chuckles) Slater. It's... it's useless, Chris. It's just about as useless as I am. I've seen phoney acts, friend, but you're not one of 'em. You're damn right I'm not, friend. - Slater, this is Keno. - Slater. I'm a freak, Keno. I'm a half-man, half-gun. I can't whip a six-year-old girl in a fair fight... ...but I can blow a man's eyeballs out at a hundred yards in a sandstorm. Yes, sir, I'm a real attraction. This is a tough way to make a livin'. You know a better? Better than this. Chris, nobody ever heard of a one-armed gunny. Not until just now. Can we see you in town later? Yeah. You ain't just feelin' sorry for me? A wife and a gaggle of kids. So you sold out, Levi? No, no. I bought in. No, it takes a man my age to appreciate a real woman. She's worth it, too. I appreciate 'em, Levi, every one I ever had. I just appreciated the hell out of 'em. I don't think you ever met a real woman, nino. - Except maybe your mama. - Yeah. Los hombres tienen que pelear, las mujeres tienen que llorar. The... the men have to fight and the women have to cry. I was lonely. I wanted to say something in my own language. Why, Max, do men have to fight and women have to cry? I don't know, Chris. It's just a saying. Comin' out. Oh. I wish this was for real money. Well, it won't be long. $100. I've never even seen that much money before. Sure buy a lot of watermelon. You're about to get yourself all busted up, boy. Your rag arm. If you weren't a cripple I'd break your back. It was a joke, Cassie. A joke, that's all. I don't see nobody laughin'. Maybe it was a bad joke. It was a bad joke. Let him go, Cassie. (Chris) Queen bets. - In for one. - Yeah. - I call. - Yeah. - Comin' round again. Ace with the queen. - Here we go. - Yeah. - Jack, seven, ten. May I have a word with you, Chris? These are my friends, PJ. Queen, ace bets one. - Call. - Hear you're lookin'. - I'm lookin'. - Well, I'm askin'. (coughs) You sure you're up to it, PJ? Yeah, I'm up to it. You wanna know what it is? Well, if you're in, it's all right with me. You wanna know the money? Whatever you say. There's a seat open over here, PJ. Seven here. (in Spanish) Hurry up. Come on. (in Spanish) Speed it up. Move it. Get in the wagon. (boy) Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Hijo. (in Spanish) Get back! Get in the wagon! (in Spanish) Get back! Get back! - (boy in Spanish) Leave him alone! - (in Spanish) Get back! (in Spanish) Diaz, go get the colonel quickly. (in Spanish) My son, it's been such a long time. (in Spanish) Come on, old man. Get in the wagon! (in Spanish) And you, boy, go to hell. He's our prisoner. They have to go back. I'm warning you, sir. Get out of my way. Where do you live? In the hills. Have you no home? They burned it. Where will you go? To find my father. Well, maybe we can help you. Why do you want to help me? You ask too many questions. - I asked only one. - Then I will ask one. Where will you go if not with us? I will ride with him. - What is your name? - Levi Morgan. What's yours? - Emiliano Zapata. - I'll call you Emil. - I'll call you Levi. - All right. He's the one I told you about. There he is. The one I told you about. Do you not know interfering with a federal guard is a prison offence? I made a mistake. You have my apologies, Colonel. Next time you will act differently? You may be sure of that, Colonel. A lot differently. - What are you looking for here? - Silver. - What else? - Gold? Without supplies? No food or tools? You hunt silver with a gun? You shoot it like an animal? No, we thought we would get our supplies here. There is nothing here, senor. No silver in the hills - only rebels. I'm glad you told us that, Colonel. If we see any rebels, we'll report them to you. You will not stay long, senor. Only until we get what we came for. I trust that will be soon. We all do, Colonel. Una mona se vista de seda, mona se queda. A pig without armour is still but a pig. (in Spanish) Here comes Maximiliano! Maximiliano! Maximiliano! (in Spanish) Over here, Maximiliano! I see and you see. All the young men are hidden in the hills. They'll come down when Quintero is free and not before. (PJ coughs) (coughs) No, no, no. So, so, so, so, so, so. (grunts) (laughs) Oh, oh, oh. Yeah. Thank you. - Gracias. - De nada. It's Lobero. - Is that a welcome party or a lynch party? - With Lobero, you never can tell. $600. American. Where are the cannons? The guns? The dynamite? Is this, these few men... ...this is what you bring to take our little dove from Diego? - You don't understand, Lobero. - I understand. Does he understand? That one? He is the leader. I can tell. It is in the eyes. Does he understand that he will have to fight against soldiers? Soldiers, not Indians with little bows and arrows. Soldiers! 10 times more than you. - He has a plan. - He has a plan(?) He also has our money, but I am the only one that has the men and the guns. What plan? Where is this plan? When I'm ready, I'll tell ya. When he is ready. Not when Lobero is ready, when he is ready! - Well, give him a chance, Lobero. - I do not need your advice! All right. I will wait. But not for long. Vamonosl - Levi? - Huh? Will my father ever come home? Oh, you bet he will. - Levi? - Hm? Will you be my father until he comes home? You bet I will. - Levi? - What? Why is it that people always fight? Well, someday you're gonna be an old man, just like me... ...and when you are you may get an answer to that question and if you do... ...you tell me, will ya? You bet I will. - Max? - Hm? You ever been inside the rathole? Not yet. Well, you will be. - How's that? - We gotta get the layout. How are we going to get in? Just ride in. (coughs) (Slater) I'm a freak. I'm a freak. Rag man... rag arm. I'm a freak. Freak... freak. Freak. (man) Buffalo Ben, is he? Never heard of him. (cackling) (Cassie) Rag arm... You're going to get yourself all busted up, boy. If you weren't a cripple, I'd break your back. (Slater) It was a joke, Cassie. A joke, that's all. (Cassie) I don't see nobody laughin'. We need water for our horses. You must have permission. Well, your colonel is an old friend. I will check with the sergeant. Permission to water horses. Si. The sergeant, he will talk to the colonel. It's a nice place you've got here. Thank you. The presidente himself gave us a commendation. - It's a big place. - 200 men. Does my friend work you seven days a week? It is hard work. But only six days. Sunday is no work. - Our wives come that day. - Early, I bet, huh? Unhappily, no, sir. In the afternoon after church. Some just say they are wives. I have two. - The prisoners' wives come too? - Never. Seven days a week for them. Well, have fun with both your wives. Ah, the treasure hunters. You are just in time. You will talk now... ...or you will never talk again. Who are your district leaders? Where are your guns? What are your orders? With what treacherous generals do you meet? I repeat, with what treacherous generals do you meet? I cannot ask your forgiveness, my friends. I can only ask it of God. (anguished cries) The ceremony is over. Soon there will be another... ...and another, and another, until you learn. Did you find your silver? - No silver. - Where are the rest of your men? In the hills. Oh, that is dangerous. The hills are full of bandits and criminals. You will be leaving soon? Good. I would advise it. I have advised it before. Yes. Very few men have impressed me as you have, Colonel. Lieutenant. Did you notice anything... anything unusual? No, sir. That is why you are not a colonel. They did not water their horses. Why did they come here? You've seen what I've seen, except in the prison. You should be glad you didn't see it. That's 200 of 'em. - That's thirty to one. - Thin odds. What about Lobero? You never can tell with him. He changes like the wind. - Without him, we might be dead. - Even with him, we might be. You want out? Nobody told you it would be easy. You're being paid to do a job. I'm gonna do what I have to do, you're gonna do what you have to do. Anybody that wants out is out. Whoa! When do we fight? Ask Chris. You. You have looked. You have seen. What do you wait for? I say attack, now. You have been paid. Earn it. You have taken the money, but you do not deliver the goods. What do you know of this land? Of my people and their needs? You are nothing but a stinking hired killer. You say you have a plan. What is this plan for my people? You're not one of your people. You are a liar and a coward. If you move any way but backwards, then you lose that eye. Now get outta here. Vamonosl Ha! Ha! There go our troops. Emil, are you sure this is the way? I am sure. I think. - There are gonna be three wagons? - That's what I saw before. Chris. I don't believe him. Lobero. - About what? - The money. You do not help us only because of the money. Do you, Chris? Like Max says, you ask too many questions. (gunshots) Drop it! - Vamonos, vamonos. - Amigos, atras, atras. Atras, atras. (in Spanish) Come on! Move it! (in Spanish) Let's go! Everybody out. Vamonos, vamonos. Rapido, rapido. Rapidol Vamonos. - Vamonos, vamonos. - Papal Papal Papal (yells) (cheering) Back in the wagon! Come on! Get in there! Get back in the wagon! Come on. Come on. (in Spanish) Come on! (in Spanish) And you, and you, and you... (cheering) Now we got somethin' to work with. It cuts the odds. Not much, but some. Chris, I have 20 men. One for each rifle and each horse. They're ready to fight. - But can they? - Well, they're young, strong, angry... - And they will learn, huh? - Right. (in Spanish) Get on the horses! Drink. Drink. It is hot. It is good for you. You are skinny. You could be such a fine-looking man. You have a good face. Did your mother never feed you? Maybe I should fatten you up. About last night... Thanks. - But of all of 'em, why you? - I was the closest. This uniform didn't bother you none? Why should it? It's dead, man. You're wearing a shroud. You don't know what it's like, Cassie. Bein' lonely an' all. People look at ya like you're some sort of animal. Slater, you are an amateur. You don't know what being lonely really is. If it's conversation you're looking for, tell me how you got to be a cripple... ...and I'll tell you all about bein' black. - Do they always cover the wagons? - Yes. To keep the sulphur from blowing away in the wind. - Where do they go? - To the railroad. - How far? - Two, maybe three miles. - Every day? - Sometimes twice. - What's at the railroad? - A small place. An office for the railroad and a cantina for the federales. (in Spanish) Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name... (laughter) - How's it goin'? - Rough. They wanna learn. I've tried to teach 'em. Some of 'em could be damn good. But we need more time. There's no more time. Tomorrow's ladies' day at the rathole. They'll hardly be in a fightin' mood. Too bad Lobero isn't. We could still use him. I don't think you'd like him ridin' behind ya. Gabriel. - Just in case. - No, Chris. We made a deal. It's yours. When you get Quintero back, we get that back. - Chris? - Yeah? Can I go with you tomorrow? - No. - Why not? You're too little. Chris? Mm-hm? How big do you have to be to die? Go to bed, Emil. You scared, reb? No. I am. You just don't give a damn. Ain't that about it, Slater? No, you just don't believe in life after birth. Do you? Did once. Now I can't even get a job to support my wife and kids. And you think you've got troubles? You could have been a black one-armed gunny. You got a wife and kids? What happened? She found a whole man. Well, I guess that makes her about half a woman. And you're better off, boy. These people... ...they got you hooked. No man gets hooked unless he wants to be hooked. Besides, what else is there? There's no more open land. Mountain man is dead. Buffalo are gone. Soon the horses'll go. Then it'll be our turn. You know anybody that'll be sorry to see you go? Maybe these people'll be sorry to see us go. What am I preachin' at you for? I'll see you in the mornin'. Yeah. I hope you'll see me tomorrow night too. Lobero! Maximiliano comes. Well, tomorrow is the day. So, he sent you to apologise to me, uh? He wants to beg me to help him. He does not even know I'm here. He would shoot me. - He's a proud man. - A proud man. He is a greedy man. Well, perhaps, in the beginning, maybe he was... ...but now... now, he feels for us. Then let him fight for us. I hear that he has an army. Killers, with rifles from the federales. It's only a few farmers. Listen, Lobero. If it's an apology you want, I apologise. - I beg for your help. - Lobero, maybe we should... What has Quintero ever done for us? Has he made me a general? No. He has fancy clothes. He makes fancy talk. He's no more than a politico. What will get us guns? A little man with a funny hat... ...or $600 that you gave to a stranger? Chris was right. You don't have big dreams, Lobero, only a big belly. (chuckles) And the rest of you, remember tomorrow, when you're half drunk and all crazy... ...that your brothers are out there dying for you. Maximiliano is right. You have no big dreams. Shh! Shh! (music and laughter) My horse threw me. My horse threw me back... there. (in Spanish) Out! Out! Let's go! Hurry up! (smashing glass) (yelling) (whooping) (in Spanish) Leave me alone! Leave me alone! (woman continues shouting) (whispers) PJ. (gunfire) (in Spanish) It's an attack! Cassie! Go! Take some men. Kill Quintero, quickly. Maximiliano. Hijo mio. A la torrel Keno. No questions. It will not be long for them now. Well, did you find your silver? Do not worry, Carlotta. He will not shoot us. I know this kind. He fights for money, not for passion. Matter of business with him. Maybe we can make what you call... ...a deal, huh? (shouting) - Where's your hero? - Lobero? He was sick. A bullet. In... ...his belly. Emil, uh... I made this for ya. It's really just a frog sticker, Emiliano... ...but if a man used a real one in the right way... ...he might be able to help his people one day. - Levi? - What? Chris. Chris, we're going to scatter in the hills and we're going to fight them again. We will stalk them in the night like jaguars. We will... we will sweep down from the mountains like hawks. We're going to tear out their throats like wolves. In the deserts, Chris, in the valleys, all of us, Chris... Goodbye, Chris. Los cobardes mueren muchas muertes. El valiente, solo una. Max, you must stop them, quickly. - The money. All the money. He forgot. - Chris! Chris! Max! He did not forget. Max? What did Chris say? He said that cowards die many deaths, the brave only one.
