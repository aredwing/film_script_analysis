One of the most prestigious schools in the country. Actually I do not even mind the scholarship. I mean, of course my parents could not afford to send me here. But the real reason we need this school, even though it is governed as a dictatorship with silly ... ... Narcissistic and abusive rules, the real reason is because ... ... It has the most crazy and insane vandals worldwide. The "Eight Crazy." And our first work will throw Vern to the source! Wilson, if you can not control these guys, I'll find someone who can. Hey, what are you doing? I want everyone in my office to that already! "Costilla," our sadistic supervising teacher. After our remarkable resistance to the lashes, I'm sure that has something up his sleeve unpleasant. Does anyone? Significa comprtense o vyanse a la f... Do I make myself clear, gentlemen? What? Sorry, sir, I'm confused. What did he mean by that "F"? I must warn you, boy. He estado ejercitndome. Well, enjoy the anticipation, I'll be watching. Retrense.

Oh, you would catch "mad dog" causing terror in the freshmen. In fact the new guys have so much ... ... Afraid to do whatever he says. Get down! Lizards! Well, become the dead.

Everything was Rambo said, "It's time to stop being children and become legends." Boys, welcome to the legendary wall of fame. Whose are these names? Spud, are all guys who told the Director to the goal. I bet that "Glock" has not even checked under his old desk. How did you hear about this? Haywire Mckenzie who was expelled for eating consideration. He vomited here. You see guys, not everyone can make their names under this desk. - Until then ... - Or I can do it again. No, can not. Everything we have done are a few nocturnal escapades. Nor even we deserve to be here. Let's go. "Mocoso" This is where our quest to become legends begins.

Before your friend Black, do you do something incredibly stupid. But if you and I work together, perhaps your future is safe. Well. Could you think about that Milton? Yes sir. Retrate. I do not know what you're thinking, but it is very obvious what's happening. Costilla will stop at nothing to make us expel all. - You are absolutely right. - We must stay together. Which only leaves us with one option. Costilla catch before he caught us. - Yes. - Yes. What do you mean? I want to give everything to get fired. What? He dresses as was watching the Glock. Right? All we have to do is prove that ... ... Costilla can not control our house and sent a farmer. If, farmer. I do not see how we can do that without expel us. Do not worry about it, Spud.

Dad, I don't- Is that a maybe? It is a maybe. SECOND QUARTER. Every night at 8, Costilla was leaving his house to go for cigarettes. It was also the time when Eve liked to bathe. How to fit this into our master plan, he was not sure. But you could not say no to Rambo who had us ... ... I convinced that even had sex with Eve when he felt like it.

Costilla want to betray my friends. Threatens to take away my scholarship. So it is being an informer or be shattered, right? Do you still want to be a Milton actor? - More than anything in the world, sir. - Well! Well, think of all the great actors. They have always given the middle finger to authority.

Rugby This field is off limits to all ... ... Those who are not members and only they, out, out! Out! Out! I do not know what your game Edly, but I assure you ... ... You will not make a mockery of our sacred traditions. They were good just standing on the lawn, director, not burning the flag. Exactly the source of arson. Is this about your early retirement? The only one in danger of an early withdrawal is this school. Do not push Edly, I have the board in my pocket on this. It is the cambo Ruby, not the field of poetry. - Good. - Understood.
