I hope it's not an ulcer. You're sweating. Another nightmare? No... the same one. Paul? Is something wrong? No, I've been feeling strange for the last couple of days. You've got to relax. Come on, this is what you worked so hard for. You got Howard to invest. I know, but you're the genius. Everything you touch... turns to gold. What made you say that? Come on, you really don't know how to have fun, do you? Don't you feel like everything's changed all at once? Of course, it's changed. We're fucking rich! Could we just enjoy it? Come on. Yeah. I don't find any of this enjoyable. Okay. No... Barbara, not that. That was great what you were doing there. - It's not that. - Okay. - I didn't mean that. - Don't do this, okay? Please. Sorry. So now you have to smoke? It's Howard's boat. He doesn't mind. "It's Howard's boat. He doesn't mind." Fine. Wait. Paul. Can't you leave that thing alone for five minutes? Please? Our stocks could be going underwater, and we wouldn't know it. I'm not worried about that. There are two possibilities. The share price stabilizes, and we're fine. Or it keeps going down, and there are two possibilities. We are in a boat off the coast of Espana. Please. Espana. Mother country, right? My mother wouldn't let me learn Spanish. Ran away to the States first chance she got. Well, now you're here. - Full circle. - Uh-huh. It's destiny. You can't program life. Why not? - It's a binary system. - Aw... Come on. Man, woman... rich, poor... - life, death... - Paul? I like that. - Grow up, okay? - What are you doing? - Nothing. I'm just going on vacation. Barbara. Honey... be careful with the company files. Vicki, sorry. There. Now the stock is underwater. What did you do?! Have you gone nuts? - You're fucking crazy? - Wake up, Paul! Look around! It's beautiful. - There will be a beautiful sunset. - There will be a beautiful sunset. That's great! That makes everything all right. There's only one thing. Now I only have those files on disk. I'm not backed up, all right? You're so backed up that's your ass coming over the horizon. Would you mind moving? There's only a little sun left and you're standing in it. Remember when we used to fight like that, darling? Except I would have thrown you overboard. Would have been cheaper. Hey... do you hear that? It's coming from that village. Probably some sort of religious festival. That's all we need. Singing nuns. I'm going to freshen up. Excuse me. Excuse me. I don't like the look of those. Yep. I'd say we've got a storm coming. All right, let's move everything below deck... or tie it down. That thing's coming right at us. I'll take us away from the reef. - Up anchor. - Yeah, sure. - Where is it? - I've got it. - You're not looking too well. - I'll be okay. Aw, shit! - Hey, look out! - Brace yourselves! Jesus! Aaaah! - Are you guys all right? - Yeah. - I think so. - You sure? - Yeah. - Yeah. Vicki? Okay, baby. Paul, give me a hand here. It's okay, Vicki. I'll radio for help. - Can you move your leg at all? - No, I can't. - I can't. - The radio's out. And the computer-- Okay. Take this and go signal to the shore. - Hurry! - What? Don't worry, we'll get you out of here. All right, okay. Come on! Where the hell is everybody? Damn it! We'll have to take the raft into that town for help. Okay... you go with Paul. I'll stay with Vicki. - It's my boat. - Howard, please. I'm staying here. - Okay, hold this. - I got it. - I'll be back soon, okay? - Please, please... Oh God. It'll be okay. Hang in there, okay? - You think she'll be okay? - Not if this crate sinks. Howard... are we going to die? No, not us. We're survivors. Rescue at sea, hey, darling. Okay. All right. We've got to get to shore fast. They won't have a chance if the storm gets worse. What the hell was that? We must have hit a rock. That's one possibility. We've sprung a leak. Anything to bail with? No, we have to make it to the dock. There's something in the water. What? I don't know. I felt something. I can't see anything. What are they shooting at? Please don't let it be sharks. Okay... - we've got to go back. - Are you crazy? We can't even make it to the dock! Well... Come on! I can't. - Dump the motor. - What?! Dump it. Come on. Use this. Come on. We've got to put in the thing. - Come on. - What do you do with it? Where the hell is everybody? Oh great. This way. No, wait. The singing. It's coming from the church. Hello? We need help. Ayuda, por favor. What the hell's going on here? What kind of church is this? Si? - We need the police. - La policia, por favor. - And a doctor. - Y un doctor. Nuestro barco choco. Nuestros amigos estan heridos. - Donde? Lleveme ahi. - Come on. It's right there. There! Tenemos que llegar alli. Imposible. La tormenta. Pero hay gente alli en el barco. Hey, you guys! Can they help us? Levade o home o barco. Xa me quedo eu coa muller. Los llevaran al barco. - He says they'll take us. - Let's go. Alguno de ustedes podria quedarse para informar a la policia? - What now? - He says someone has to stay here - to inform the police. - La senorita podria quedarse. All right. - You stay. - No. - You hate boats. I'll go. - No. I'll be fine. It's just... I don't want to leave you with this guy. - He gives me the creeps. - I'll help the senorita to find the police, and the doctor. Fine. Listen... be careful, yeah? Okay. Two possibilities. Okay. No funciona? Hay un telefono en el hotel. El hotel? Si, el Hotel del Mar. Usted avise a la policia. Yo traere al medico. - Gracias. - De nada. Necesito un telefono, por favor. Es una emergencia. El padre dijo que podria utilizar su telefono para llamar a la policia. Si? Podria utilizar su telefono, por favor? Let go! Hey! Ay! Padre, me ataco! Padre! Padre! All right. Bring us alongside. Howard, Vicki, I'm back. Howard? Vicki? Howard? Your friends? La senorita goes to find the police. Where? In Santiago. 50 kilometers. No police in Imboca. She says to go to hotel. She come one hour. What hotel? I'm supposed to meet someone here. A woman. Senorita. No? Senorita? Just give me a room till she gets back. Roomo... pleaso? Room, por favor. Muchos dias. Uh... it's upstairs? The room? I-- upstairso? Esta eiqui. Puxeno no habitacion. Dixenle que agarde. Oh! I don't fucking think so. What the fuck?! Barbara? I'm so glad you're back. What the-- What? Come on. Oh shit! Come on. Can I help you? Oh, fuck! Oh man! E Xavier! Xavier foise. Esta no secadeiro. No secadeiro, ben. A que esperades. Oh no. Oh my God! Howard! Stay away. Axuda! Axuda! Axuda! Shut up! What's the matter with you people? Why are you doing this? You're going to help me. And you won't make a sound. Silencio, understand? Understand? Huh? Okay. No hurt. - Why did they kill my friends? - They take his face. They kill you. Take your face. There was a woman on the boat. She dead. Two women dead. Two women? Si. One from the boat, one comes with you to la iglesia. The woman who came with me to the church, she's dead? Si. They kill. - How do you know? Are you sure? - I see them kill. The women... they die. No one leave Imboca. People come... no one leave. Why? What-- why try to kill us? What did we do? You think Ezequiel is loco. But I tell you true. I tell you secret. Secret of Imboca. Long before... Imboca no like now. Imboca pueblo de Cristo. Town of God. I am boy... son of fisherman. But no fish in ocean. So, we pray. But God, he no answer. Then come... Capitan Combarro. He say in great Pacific Ocean, discover gold. He say people fools. Pray to God who no answer prayer. He say he know God who bring fish... and more. Priest say no, but capitan say... he bring great God to Imboca. I hear first time... new prayer. "Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn!" I wish I never hear. I wish I never see. Soon, Imboca rich. There is much fish, and much gold. Gold from the sea. People go against God. No worship Cristo. All worship Dagon. Or die. All Imboca pray to Dagon. But one day, no more gold. Dagon want sacrifice. All worship Dagon... or die. Two possibilities. Either you're drunk... or you're totally fucking insane! What did you do that for? What are you doing? Drink, si. Loco, si. But I tell you true. Ezequiel no lie. I am last man in Imboca. Oh yeah? Yeah? Why didn't they kill you? I drink. I loco. You? Loco? No, really? I've got to get out of here. I need a car. No coche in Imboca. I saw a car, a big black car. Only coche in Imboca, but you won't get, belong to Xavier Combarro, grandson to capitan Combarro. That's Xavier. What the hell's wrong with him? What's wrong with everybody in this town? They are changing. - Changing to go into sea. - Into what-- the sea? Some cannot walk anymore. Xavier can go into sea, but he stay in Imboca. Bastardo! Oh great. - What am I going to do with you? - No kill! No kill! - I am man, like you. - There are two possibilities. - I kill you-- - I no tell. - I no tell nobody. - Or I could trust you. Okay? And then there are two possibilities. But I don't have time to-- Oh fuck! Where are you going? Bebo solo Ribeiro y solo Albarino de Rias Baixas... y Orujo. Carallo! Bebo solo Ribeiro y solo Albarino de Rias Baixas... y Orujo. Carallo. Non bebes? Pai? Si, pai. Uxia... oixes algo? Vixes alguien? Non, pai, non vin ningun. Boas noites, Uxia. Que dormas ben. Boas noites, pai. Thank you. - I dreamt-- - I know. Who are you? I am Uxia. I've been waiting for you. No, I can't. I can't. - I can't do this. - Please. Paul. Stay. Stay with me, please. Please! Paul! I need a bigger cell phone. Come on. Please. Pablo, quedate! Please! Stay! Help me. Yes! No! Esta eiqui! Esta eiqui! Vide, vide! Correde! Esta eiqui! Shut up! You've got the wrong guy. - Esta eiqui! - It's a mistake, kid. - Abo, abo, esta eiqui. - Shut up! You're making a mistake! Shut the fuck up! Vena, vena, vena! Asi, asi, asi! Dalle, dalle mais. Corre, corre, vena, asi! Vena, vena, vena! Vena, abo! Abo, vena! Vena, vena, vena! Abo! Abo, abo, abo. Abo, abo, desperta. Abo, desperta. Matastelo. Fablame, fablame, abo, abo. Son of a bitch! Paul? Paul. Hey. It's me, Barbara. Barbara? Barbara? Barbara. Hey, that's my lighter. Yeah. It saved my life. If we get out of this, you can smoke all you want. He told me you were dead. Who? I tell him, senora. Ezequiel! Si. I am like you, now. A prisoner. You said you saw them killed. Worse than kill. What's that? Come. She was already here when they locked me up. It's Barbara. Vicki? It's okay. I'm here. What happened? Howard's... dead. - I know. - They took him under. He couldn't breathe. It crushed his head. But you're alive. You're still alive. - Try not to think about it. - No. It-- oh God. - It's inside me. - They give to Dagon. - What does that mean? - He have her. Take her. Se la ha follado. He fuck her. It took me under. I was covered-- It had all these-- oh God, it-- I was... sick. I couldn't breathe. Vicki, listen to me. - We'll get out of this. - My leg! There was an accident on the boat. They must have... given you drugs for the pain and made you hallucinate. It was a dream. A dream? Is no dream. We'll get you to a doctor. Why are they doing this? Because you know. Know what? Their secret. What secret? Listen... if that happens to me... you've got to promise... you'll kill me. Listen to me. We'll get out of this. Promise. Please. Seguideme! They come. - They take our skin. - Don't let them take me! They pray to that thing! They're not human! You've got to be quiet. Voy por ti, cabron! - Come on, Vicki! - No. Barbara! Barbara! Now, you serve Dagon. No! No. - It's the only way. - Vicki! Goodbye, Paul. - Vicki! - Vicki, no! Vicki! Vicki! Vicki! Vicki! Levadeos! No! Don't let them take me! - No! - Let her go! Let her go! A la teneria, de presa! No! Como pudeste facernos esto? Parece mentira. Dexaronte vivir e traicionaxesnos. You will die here... in Imboca. We will live for eternity in the sea. This is the way of Dagon. Look... I can write you a check now for $1 million. $10 million if you let us go and the woman. Okay? We have thousand times that in gold. It means nothing. Great! Great! Ia! Ia! Cthulhu... fhtagn! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. If you hadn't helped me, I-- No. You make me remember... my father... and my mother... and who they want me to be. Muchas gracias, mi amigo. I will see your faces again... but you will not see mine. Si, but we die like men. The Lord is mi pastor. I no want. He make me lie down... - fuentes tranquilas. - ...In green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. ...me guia por el camino justo, por el honor de su nombre. He leadeth me in the path of righteousness... for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff... comfort me. Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. My cup runneth over. Thy loving kindness and mercy... shall follow me... all the days of my life. And I shall dwell... in the house of the Lord... forever. Do it. Do it! No! Quitalle as mans de arriba! Non lle manques! El sacrificio debe continuar. Osas decirme lo que debo hacer? Vete! Tengo que hablar con el. You will live because you are mine. You want to tell me why this is happening? You will understand everything soon. But you must stay with me. If I stay, will you let Barbara go? Until you came, there had been no sacrifices for a year. - Dagon needs her. - Fuck Dagon! Yes. And their child will be immortal. But there's a catch! It has to live the rest of its life as some half-assed fish in the sea! In joy, with Dagon. I'll do whatever you want. Please... let her go. You cannot care for her. You do not dream of her. We will go soon to a beautiful place. You'll forget your world... and your friends. There will be no time, no end, no today, no yesterday, no tomorrow... only the forever, and forever, and forever, without end. I don't have a choice, do I? No. It is your fate, your destiny. I still have human feelings. Imbocanos, escuchademe. Paul quedara en liberdade. Traedeo a ceremonia. Levate a ese cabron. The priestess Uxia chooses you... a man. Come on, motherfucker! I'm not a defenseless old man. You want this face? This is what it's like to die! You motherfuckers! Two possibilities. Right. Stop! It's enough! Para! Para! Goddamnit! Damn you! Te voy a matar, hija de puta. Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn! Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn! Ia! Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn! No! No! No! No! Ia! Ia! No! Leave me alone! Por favor. Dagon! Ia! Ia! You'll rot in hell! You'll burn for fucking eternity! We will live for eternity, and so will your child. Dagon! Ia! Ia! No! Pablo! Barbara! Barbara! I got you. I got you. Okay. Kill me. You promised. No. I'll get you out. I'll get you out. Barbara! No! Parad! - Pablo. - Si, pai, si. I look for you. I dream, pero nada. What-- You Combarro. - I'm Paul Marsh. - No. Your mother married Xavier. She steal you. Once, he was young, and rich... and handsome for a man. He brought women to Imboca. Outsiders... - your mother. - No! I think I never see you again. Imbocanos... Es Pablo. Pablo Combarro ha vuelto. Ten o sinais. You... are my son. You're fucking insane! Pablo. It is your destiny. You stay away! I'll kill you all! I'll burn this town to the ground! We had different mothers, but the same father. We are children of Dagon. You're a bunch of fucking freaks! Your dreams... remember your dreams, Pablo. They brought you here. They were nightmares. They weren't real. Every dream is a wish. Somebody help me. What's happening to me? You are my brother. You will be my lover... forever. No possibilities. Pablo! No! No!
