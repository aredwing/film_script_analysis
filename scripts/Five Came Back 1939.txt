Anything but murder, mister. If anybody asks for us... you've never seen us, and you never brought us here. Is that clear? That's not only clear, It's the truth, so help me. Good. There it is. Our plane, huh? In a few minutes, we'll be out of all this mess. It's wonderful. Miss Peggy Nolan! Beg your pardon, are you miss Nolan? No. Sorry. Miss Nolan! Miss Peggy Nolan! Miss Peggy Nolan! That's my name. Package for you, miss Nolan. Thank you. Violets, Madame. Gardenias, 10 cents. Perhaps you can sell these. Orchids. Thank you very much. Next plane, flight number nine, the silver queen. Los Angeles to panama via Tepic, Mexico. Leaving... I do hope they haven't misplaced our luggage. Martha, dear, I'm sure the young man knows his business Quite well enough to take care of everything. He didn't look to me As if he had a brain in his head. Straighten your tie, Henry. Thank you, dear. Thank you. Hello, Joe. A note from the superintendent. Thanks, ray. Oh, hello. Hello. Traveling with us? Mm-Hmm. Yes, we are. Watch your step, Tommy. Now, Tommy, I want you to be a good boy And mind your uncle Pete just as you would me. Do I have to go away and leave you? Oh, I'll be with you in a day or two. Then we'll get a boat and go fishing and swimming And everything. How would you like that? I'll join you in about a week. Mike, why don't you chuck everything and come with us? You've squared all your beefs. Nobody can lay a finger on you. I'm thinking of him. O.K. I'll see you in panama city. See you later, Tommy. I'll see you later. Don't be long. I won't. Get going. Say good-Bye to your pop. Bye. Good-Bye, son. See you soon, daddy. That's the two we had trouble with? Yes, sir. Six and seven cylinders. Take a look at this, bill Young man, how many minutes before we start? We'll be held up about a quarter of an hour. Orders from the department of labor. The department of labor indeed, You'll have to find a better reason than that. We're taking on an anarchist. Anarchist? Yes. Murdered some war minister down south. Murderer!? They thing he's crazy. But don't worry, folks. He'll be in custody the entire trip. He may not be as crazy as they think. The government of my country deeply regrets the trouble to which you've been put. Oh, it's no trouble at all. Will you kindly sign right there, please? You too, Crimm. Senor. Well, there are your deportation papers. Once again, many thanks. Here are your tickets and expense money. You'll get the reward when you deliver him to the proper authorities. All this is very useless, gentlemen. I can promise you you will never deliver me To the proper authorities. With 5,000 bucks waiting for me when I hand you over? I'll get you there If I have to take you in a little box. Are you positive you don't want us to send one of our officers Along with crimp? I am certain senor crimp will deliver him safely. If you please, gentlemen, don't move. You haven't a chance, Vasquez. This is the seventh floor, and between here and the street, There are at least 50 officers... all armed. Hanging is such an unpleasant death. Besides, a hanged man always dies alone. I much prefer dying in the company of decent citizens like you... always provided I'm the last to die. So don't try to stop me. Behind you, Vasquez. Drop that gun. Your warning might have cost Murphy his life. What's the matter with you, crimp? I said I'd deliver him alive, and I will. Nobody's going to do me out of my reward. They are holding the plane for you now. Come on, you. That's him. Have you got a match? No. Thank you, miss. Looks like we're taking the same plane, sister. I don't talk to cops. They been bothering you much lately? Your papers are in order. The steward will show you to your seats. Thank you. That's all right. The steward will show you to your seat, too. Ready to go, miss? Altitude 3,000 feet. Visibility good. Ceiling unlimited. Give me weather at Tepic. Wx2z to wnwo. Come in. Wx2z back to wnwo. O.K., thanks. Wx2z off. Tepic's all clear. Swell. What are you going to do when we lay over in panama city? Sleep. I'm figuring on a round of gaiety. With the passenger in seat 5? Right. That's her boss with her, isn't it? Sure. Young Alice. She says his old man owns half of south America. Rubber and tin. He might not like the idea Of you chiseling in on his secretary. They're mighty friendly. I suppose if you had a secretary, You'd give her a slap in the teeth. I saw them holding hands. Well, maybe he's got business worries. Yeah, maybe. I think I'll go aft and have a sandwich. Hey, skipper. Good evening. Aren't you going to get any sleep? Later on maybe. I just want to be sure my friend here Doesn't try to go for a walk. At this altitude? You might want to get it over in a hurry, And you're worth 5,000 bucks to me. Yes, Mr. Crimp. I'm very expensive merchandise... and I warn you... You'd better not relax your vigilance for one minute. I'll stay awake all night. All right, now, Tommy, let's go to sleep. Well, we have to say our prayers first. What do you mean "we"? Don't you say your prayers every night? Uh, sure, sure, I do. Shall we say your prayers or mine? Well, I'm kind of sick of my prayers. Let's try yours. Now I lay me down to sleep. Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the lord my soul to keep. I pray the lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake... if I should die before I wake... I pray the lord my soul to take. I pray the lord my soul to take. Please take good care of my daddy. It's personal right here. You don't have to say it if you don't want to. Oh, sure, sure. I get it. Please take good care of my daddy And help us to get back together again Soon as you think you can. Thank you. Amen. O.K., Tommy. Now can we get some shuteye? Good night, Pete. Good night, kid. Nice night. Yeah. We land at Tepic in the morning, don't we? That's what the timetable says. I thought perhaps you'd like a cigarette. No smoking allowed in here. You don't talk much, do you? Lady, we hit some bumpy air over the mountains, You might feel it less if you go to bed. Go to sleep. I get it. Well, good night. Oh, why don't they go to sleep? I'll take the call for you, Larry. Don't bother, Mr. Brooks. No bother at all. Oh, I get it. Number 5's that good-Looking gal. You want to borrow my steward's coat? Steward! Oh, it's you. Is there something I can do? The ventilator's stuck... but I called for the steward. I'm pinch-Hitting for him. I suppose he's flying the ship for you. Seems to be jammed. You know, we stop off at Tepic, Mexico, in the morning. They told me that when I bought my ticket. I'm pretty familiar with the town. You seem to specialize in getting familiar. Sure. It's fun. You ought to try it sometime. Maybe we'll leave the ventilator until morning. No, no, no. You might catch cold. Look, I've an idea. Now, lie back. Oh, but I don't see how that will help. Please. What now? Are you warm enough? Why, yes, thank you. Are you sure? It's a bad draft. Oh, yes, quite sure. Well, then, good night. Good night. Martha, at last I can get a bowl of real Mexican chili. Chili for breakfast? You'll have milk toast as usual. But, Martha, we're on vacation. Remember what the doctor said. Very well, dear. You'll do as I say. Ah, senor Joe! Buenos dias, senor. Pedro, how are you? I'm glad to see you. Excuse me a minute. Oh, hello there. Good morning. I trust you slept well. Like a log. I hope you weren't bothered By any draft last night, miss Melhorne. Draft? Oh, our pilots are so considerate, Judson. The policy of the company, ma'am. Can we get a good breakfast here? I was just going to suggest it. I don't think I care for anything. Mexican food's too hot for me. Oh, but this isn't Mexican. It's Chinese. The chef's a very good friend of mine. Then we should get some good service, eh? This your first trip to south America? Yes. You see, um... very urgent business. That's right. Some very urgent business. Mr. Ellis, if I had a good-Looking secretary like miss Melhorne here, I'd have trouble keeping my mind on just business, Even though it were urgent. You know, I always make it a rule Never to mix business with... romance. Then this! Is strictly a business trip. What did you think it was? Now, Alice, don't embarrass Mr. Brooks. Hello, Mr. Joe. Hello there. Bring you something good for breakfast this morning? This is Ching, The best Chinese cook this side of san Francisco. You'd better let me order for you. Fine. Thank you. Winning? Nope. You won't, either. Why? 'Cause that's one racket you can't win at. How do you know? I used to know the man who makes them. You should know how to beat them. I do... Don't play them. You speak Spanish. Could you order breakfast for me? Yes, I could. The waiter here is Chinese, and he speaks English. I've got a lot to do. We're taking off in a few minutes. Say, Pedro, what are those? For the oil company in panama city. Air express. They must need them in a hurry. I could have a lot of fun with the express charges. Me, too. Put them on board. When your old man finds out you ain't drinking any milk, What's he going to say? I don't want it. You go ahead and drink your milk like a good boy. I'm taking care of this kid. If I need any help, I'll ask for it, see? Sorry. You go ahead and drink your milk anyway. Don't drink it so fast. You'll get indigestion. Look, it's a kitty! Look, Mr. Crimp, a black cat... An ill omen. You're not going to have the best of luck. But this cat crossed in front of both of us, my friend. Time to go. Yep. Oh, no, this is on me. Oh, no, really, you shouldn't do that. Quite all right. Thanks very much, Juan. Here, keep the change. Thank you. Not at all. It was my pleasure. Thank you. Uh, excuse me. Aren't you Judson Ellis? Uh, yes. I'm the American pressman from Tampico. You're miss Melhorne, ain't you? We don't have anything to say. Come on, Judson. Oh, Ellis. No need denying anything. We got a wire from new York that you were on this plane. Yeah, your old man talked plenty, Practically busted a blood vessel doing it. Yours, too. You may quote us the same. We have nothing to say. All we want to know is why you're eloping. The newspapers are full of it anyway, But we want to get your side of the story. We'd like to give you a break. Please leave us alone. What we do is our own affair. It's no use, Alice. We've got to talk sometime. If I make a statement, Will you promise to print exactly what I say? You bet we will. Sure thing. The reason we're being married is because we're in love. The reason our parents object Is because they don't think we've sense enough To know our own minds. That's the truth. That's the whole story. No mystery, no scandal, no nothing. Where are you going to be married? Panama city. Tomorrow. Would you mind standing there for a picture, please? Get out of there, will you, boy? I want to make this romantic. Thank you. So she's his secretary. So what? I bought their breakfast for them. Come on, boy. What do they say? Keep on going. Weather at panama is zero, zero. He thinks we're about in the middle of it. Can we get above it? We'll try. But I think it's the same clear to the moon. Will you leave that radio alone? It's going away from our station so fast I have to keep retuning it all the time Or we won't get anything. It's too bad we're not a little further south, Mr. Ellis, I could point out the most interesting territory... The home of the Jivaros, a tribe of headhunters. Oh, I've heard a great deal about them, professor. When they kill an enemy, they cut off his head as a trophy of war. Exactly. I must write a book about the Jivaros sometime. After obtaining the head of an enemy, They slit the skin from crown to nape of neck And remove the skull. Then they fill the empty skin With hot sand or gravel and sew it up. I believe I told you, my dear, That has the effect of shrinking the head To the size of a large orange. Will you please be quiet? And in several days... I asked you to be quiet. You're a very unusual fellow, Mr. Crimp. Are you a simple maniac depressive or a schizophrenic? Your nerves are going back on you, Mr. Crimp. I'd rather have a drink. You'd be better without it, sir. Will we be out of this soon? Yes, miss. These tropical storms go faster than they come. May I lower your berth? Sandwiches? No, thanks. Doesn't seem to bother him any. He's like a baby. Lawrence... tell the driver to be very careful. Yes, ma'am. We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin From American press. The end of a notorious career was reached in the gutter Outside the Winslow hotel in san Francisco today When Michael Mulvaney was shot to death. Mulvaney, one-Time big-Shot mob leader, Was riddled by a dozen bullets When he attempted to shoot his way out of a trap set for him By members of his former gang... shut that thing off! Who resented his attempt... Was someone talking about my daddy? You was hearing things, kid. When am I going back to see my daddy? It's hard to say, Tommy. Let me take him. He needs a woman. He needs a lady. I want to go home. Shall I hold him? Come, honey. You mustn't cry. I used to have a little boy. Can't raise Tepic or panama anymore. Too much static. Well, we'll try the beam. Take over. We've lost that, too. Keep trying the range. Want some hot coffee? No. How are the passengers? Not bad, But that detective fellow's getting liquored up pretty fast. Watch him. If he turns mean, call me. Yes, sir. Here comes the wind. Any idea where we are? We're a long ways south of where we ought to be. This wind is probably driving us inland. Left engine. I may have to set her down. Turn out the cabin lights and drop a flare. Right. What's the matter with the lights? Everybody fasten their safety belts, please. Look there! It will set fire to the plane. That's only the exhaust. There's no danger from that. This thing's worse than a roller coaster. Why don't they turn around and go back? That's what I say. Why should we risk our lives Just so the pilot can get a good record? Mr. Crimp, I'm sure the pilots Know much more about it than we do. You think so, do you? Well, I know what I'm doing, too. I'm going to turn this ship around. What do you want? You fellows may be after a record, but I'm not. Turn this ship around. Go back. Go back and sit down. Mr. Crimp, please go back to your seat. You keep out of this. It's all right, Larry, we'll handle him. Mrs. Spengler! Yes. You must be tired. Let me take the baby for a while. Thank you, miss Melhorne. Be careful, Martha! Hold on! Hold on! Aah! Aah! Go back, I tell you! Shut up! Can't you see I have my hands full? I said go back! You, too! Can you hear me? Stay where you are, Joe. Drop another flare. Right. Left motor's dead. I'll have to set her down. Hold tight, everyone! I'm going to set her down! Give me your belt! Fasten your belts! Hund] I' got you. Ha on that kid. Lipcakeer I Joe Here go Br Yo brlfe yoe. Selfhejoe. E he we Yb huanyb y hu Hoto ho s to Y? O. O. Piim pi j him p, j You all right, Judson? Wrenched my arm, I think. Are you all right, Mr. Spengler? Yes, I'm all right. And you, dear? I'm not hurt. The steward's gone. What are we going to do now? There's nothing to do but wait for daylight. Make yourselves as comfortable as you can. We can't be far off the coast. Hike it in a day or so. Do you know how far we are off our course, really? Well, no, not exactly. Well, it's easy to calculate. We know how fast we went and for how long. Simple arithmetic. Simple arithmetic, eh? You know, I suppose, how fast the wind was blowing... and the degree of curve the ship took inland, huh? We'll allow for that. Young man, you haven't the faintest idea where we are. All right, you tell us, then. Probably on the east side of the Andes, Somewhere near the headwaters of the Amazon. How do you know that? Well, I'm a professor of botany amongst other things. I recognize several kinds of vegetation That only grow in that locality. We're in a valley between the two ranges of mountains, And you won't get out unless you fly out. Honestly, what chance is there to repair? Well, we smashed the right oil tank when we set her down. We've got to work on the motors and jack up the plane. That will probably take two, maybe three weeks. What about the radio? We can receive, But we can't send without another tube, And we haven't got one. We have food for a week, maybe two if we diet. Well, what do you say about getting breakfast, eh? Not a bad idea. The last radio message from brooks was received Four hours after they left Tepic. According to the speed reporters, He must be down somewhere in this area. All our available planes are searching the route. We have one squadron of reconnaissance ships in the air now. There will be two more by this afternoon. Thank you very much, commander. The coast guard is also cooperating. We're borrowing additional planes for you men From the Mexican government. You'll all take a transport plane to Acapulco, Where the ships are waiting. Concentrate your search to the north. It's not likely that they crossed the mountains Into the valleys near the Amazon. That's all, gentlemen. Thank you. This will do it. They ought to be able to see it if they fly anywhere near here. We'll keep the fire going all night. Pardon me. Hey, pilot, you might have chosen a less forsaken spot. I'm sure this place is just crawling with insects. Personally I think it's very pleasant. Hmm. No accounting for taste. Madame, you might think it was pleasant, too, If you were being taken home to be hanged. Hey, pilot, you can't do all that work on an empty stomach. Thanks. What are our chances for getting out of here? Pretty slim. I guess we're lucky to be alive, huh? Yep. Thanks to you. Don't thank me, lady, And don't blame anyone. Larry's dead, and we're cracked up, And things happen, and nobody can stop them. Yeah, I guess they do. You know you're the first woman I ever met who... who could make a good cup of coffee. Thanks, but the professor made it. Should have turned around like I wanted to. But we're here, and we've got a tough job ahead of us... That's to stay alive. He's right. There will be work for us all. Everybody's got to help. Mrs. Spengler, you'll be in charge of the cooking department. I'll be nothing of the sort. I'm not a servant. Did you hear what he said, Martha? You're the cook. Don't you use that tone to me, Henry. You were a very good cook when we married. Now let's see if you've forgotten. But... Don't argue. Cook. Better take off the left cowling, Joe. We'll need enough wood to last all night. Alice, take the ax. We can use our hands, crimp. I'm a passenger. I don't have to work. Well, that's all right with me, But those that don't work, don't eat. Casey, take everything out of the plane we can use. Give him a hand, Vasquez. Stay where you are, you. What's the idea? He's my prisoner. He takes orders from me. You ought to take orders from us. We paid our fares. Somebody's got to boss things If we're going to try and get out of here. Any other objections to my taking charge? Certainly not. The pilot of the wrecked plane Has as much authority as the captain of a wrecked ship. I think that's the law. Yeah, maybe it is, but how's he going to enforce it? Excuse me, gentlemen, but I think the officer in charge Ought to have an emblem of authority. Thanks. You want my rod, too? No, you better keep it. You might need it. Now don't make us waste any bullets on you. We might need them for food. All right. Rub-A-Dub-Dub three men in a tub The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker They all jumped out of the sweet potato Come on, Tommy. Time to go to bed. You sure know how to handle kids. Yes. I love them. I guess yours is grown up by now, huh? Mine... My little boy died when he was just that age. That's tough. Yeah. Come on if you want a listen! We got the cabin radio working, Trying to get a news broadcast. Hope they're looking for us. They better be! It's almost time for the 10:00 news broadcast From san Francisco. Maybe we'll find out what's happened to us. Well, go ahead and tune it in. No. We're waiting for the exact time. Got to save our batteries. O.K., Joe. Giants nicked two dodger pitchers For six hits and two runs But were retired by a fast double play Before they could cut down the dodger lead. This is the first time in my life That I don't care whether the giants win or lose. And from san Diego comes tragic news That commander Wilson of the naval air base Has recalled two of the squadrons Of reconnaissance planes Which have been searching for the lost airliner " silver queen, Which vanished in a tropical storm with 12 people on board. However, in the belief that the! Silver queen Was far off her course, One squadron of naval planes And several private planes chartered by the airline Will continue the search, Which has been switched to the west coast of panama. Little hope, however, Is held that any trace of the missing airliner And its cargo of 12 human lives will ever be found, As the country over which the plane was driven By the violent storm is dense and inaccessible jungle. O.K., Joe. Shut her off. A moose! He's got our scent. Let's get nearer. No, no. I'll get him from here. Darn! Missed him. There must be something the matter with this rod. No, you hit him! He's down! Oh, boy! Now we won't have to be vegetarians anymore. Do you mean it? Yeah. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You move too fast. I've seen guys lose a hand for less. I'll play you again, double or nothing. Well, I... Henry! I better go. It's past my bedtime. Turning in, Mr. Spengler? Yes. Good night, boys. Good night. I always thought professors were dumb, But that guy will surprise you. He tied me in a knot. I never was any good at games anyway. You're certainly handy with that rod of yours. Yeah. That was the best steak I ever ate. I don't want to blow my own horn, But in some circles, I'm considered very handy with a heater. Thanks for letting me keep it, though. I'm so used to it, I've even got a shoulder holster in one of my nightshirts. I had a reason for letting you keep it, Pete. Somebody has to stand guard here nights. You know, there might be animals around. Well, I'm a guardsman of the old school. Shall I start now? No. You better go to bed. I ain't sleepy. You go to bed. You got a lot of work to do on that plane tomorrow. Joe will relieve me at 2:00. You better turn in. O.K. If you need me, holler. Yeah. Night. Night. He's a pretty good guy. Yeah. They've all been pretty good... except crimp. I only hope they keep on feeling the way they do. That airliner's certainly a mess. Well, we can fix that in time. You know, Joe, This is going to be a very fine place To try to make a takeoff from. You think we can straighten that prop? We can try. What else can we do? I tell you what you can do. In fact, I've got a suggestion That will temporarily at least solve the whole problem, A solution I've tried before and has never failed. You're drunk. Elementary, my dear Watson. Don't you wish you were? You could be, you know. In fact, I've got a whole suitcase full of liquor Back there. I always provide against The minor inconveniences of modern travel. It's one of the secrets of my great success. Don't you think you better go to bed? No! Why don't you act your age, Ellis? All right, big shot. But I might as well go on the record for saying That I think you're carrying This guardianship of yours too far. You're the boss now, But if ever we get out of this, I'm liable to buy up that whole airline, And then I'll be the boss, see? Go to bed. Stand up. Sit down. Do this and do that. Who do they think they are anyhow? Hey, pipe down, you. What's the matter with you? You want a drink? No. Go to bed. I would if I could see. Why don't they have some sort of light in here anyhow? Here. Let me help you. Thanks. You needn't bother. Oh, that's all right. I've handled drunks before. No doubt. I want you to know That Alice and I are going to be married. Oh, relax. Can I have another one of those? Oh, yeah, sure. Take a drag of it. What's the matter? Can't you sleep? Mr. Ellis is kind of noisy. Oh, he's drunk. I better go quiet him down. Well, you can't blame him much. He's trying to be a good guy, But he's scared to death. Aren't you? Well, I'd feel a little better If we were out of this jam here. I've been in trouble before, But nothing like this. Yeah? What kind? Men. Oh. You didn't think I was going to panama To see the sights, did you? Well, it's mighty pretty scenery down there. You don't care much for women, do you? Oh, yeah, sure. They're all right. Never found one that really hurt, though. Is that it? Yeah, I did once. Who? My wife. Run out on you? No. No. We got married right after the war, and... weren't any jobs then, So I bought an old jenny, and... and took to barnstorming. I used to fly the plane. She was a wing walker. We played carnivals and fairs, You know, that stuff. One time down in Indiana, she didn't feel so good. I told her not to go up, But she just laughed at me, So we went up. She crawled out on the wing and fainted. We cracked up. I lived. Funny, you know. Things happen, And nobody can stop them. You better get some shuteye. Good night. Good night. Why don't you guys get wise to yourself? That thing will never fly again. Maybe you've got a better idea For getting out of here. You bet I have. We should have started to walk weeks ago. Sure, and we'd still be walking, Just as far from civilization as we are now. The only way we'll get out of here is to fly. Fly. You know what I think of you two? You're a couple of fools. Cut it out, Joe. That's right, Joe. Mind the boss. Be a good little boy. Let me help you, eh? No, thanks. I'm all right. Why do you take your whiskers off, uncle Pete? You want me to look like a gorilla? Well, no. Mrs. Spengler, do you happen to have a pin? See a pin and pick it up, All the day you have good luck. Thank you. The fisherman, eh? Your wife is very kind to me. I'm tempted to be jealous of you, Vasquez. We get fried bananas quite frequently Since Mrs. Spengler learned you were fond of them. Perhaps she's only sorry for me. Not at all, Mr. Vasquez. The moment that plane takes the air, All of you will begin to live again. As for me... You mustn't allow yourself To think of that. We're getting to know one another pretty well now. I feel I can speak freely to you, Vasquez. If you had it all over again, Would you do what you did? I don't know. My experiences here have made me think. Now, look at this camp. There are no classes here. We have chosen a leader In whom we all have supreme confidence And whom we respect completely. We have plenty to eat... The best. We are well-Sheltered. We are in good health. By all theories, Ours is an ideal community, And yet, everyone here except myself Is living for the day when all this will come to an end. That is how tightly modern living Has become wrapped up in nonessentials. Personally, I should be happy To spend all my life here. So you see, even in the jungle, I'm antisocial. I doubt that. See, this experience has changed most of us. Bill is more human. Alice has grown stronger. Ellis has grown a little weaker. Our friend Pete developed a paternal affection For little Tommy... and you, Vasquez, I think it's changed you more than anyone. Possibly, although it seems to me I have noticed some change In you people, too. Quite right. Quite a change. One I'm sure will make you very happy. Thank you for the pin, Mrs. Spengler. You know, Henry... uh-Huh? I'm afraid you'll think I'm a little crazy, but... in a way, I'm glad the plane crashed. I think I am, too. We've rediscovered each other, haven't we? What are you doing in there? Getting myself a drink. Well, why didn't you ask for one? 'Cause I wouldn't get it. Give me that. Give me that. Why don't you mind your own business? What's going on here? Oh. This, huh? I caught him stealing from my bag. I don't want anymore drinking Going on here, understand? Oh, you don't, eh? Well, we'll see about that. I'm getting tired of being bossed around by you. You know, Judson, I'd hate to have to hit you. Now, you do what I tell you. Wasn't my fault. Martha, we'll get back to our laundry. You see, he stole my liquor. That's tough. Alice. Jud, you've got to pull yourself together. Oh, so you're against me, too, eh? No, I'm not, Jud. It's just... Yes, you are. Everybody in this whole outfit's Acting like a Pollyanna, including you. We might as well face the... well, we might as well face the facts. Well, aren't you going to say anything? I was thinking of what you just said. We might as well face the facts. Alice? He's going to be all right. He's just a little mixed-Up, that's all. Yeah. I suppose so. You know, any man might go a bit haywire In a situation like this. Bill didn't. Professor Spengler didn't. Neither did Vasquez... or you. He hasn't been any help, has he? Has he? Crimp? Hey, crimp? Find any trace of him, Joe? No. I've been a mile upstream. He's been gone about seven hours. No signs of him, eh? Nope. Wouldn't it be unfortunate If something has happened him? The man is a fool. He's probably sulking around here someplace. He'll be back. Yes, if nothing has happened to him. I suppose you're going to start blabbering About Indians again the way you did on the plane. Is there Indians around here? Sure, there are. Ask your uncle Henry. Very bad Indians, too. They get you and cut your head off. Justin, for heaven's sake, be quiet. Listen you, if you're trying to scare this kid, I'm going to poke you in the jaw. Henry, you don't really think there's any danger? No, my dear, of course not. We're too far north. Why all the fuss Just because a man has been away a few hours? He'd better be back soon. Why? Because with any luck at all, We'll be out of here by tomorrow. That means I get to see my daddy. Yeah, sure. I'll be so happy to see him. It's time for you to go to bed, kid. May I take him, Pete? Here, you go on with your aunt Peggy. Come on. So we're getting out of here, huh? Yeah, looks like it. Back to our normal living, huh? To you, Mr. Ellis, it will mean marriage and happiness. I think I'll turn in. Alice, I want to talk to you. We'll talk tomorrow. No. Now. I don't care what those fellows say. They'll never get that thing in the air again. We'll know tomorrow for sure. Do you realize that we might be stuck here from now on? Do you know what that means? Yes, but if we are, We'll just have to make the best of it, that's all. Exactly. If we do get out of here, We can be married right away... but supposing we don't get out of here? You better leave... before I call someone. All right. You better go to bed, too. We're getting out of here tomorrow. Good night. Good night. You know, she's all right. Well, she is. Come on, boy. Bill? Yes, sir? I don't want to be an alarmist, But I think you ought to keep special watch tonight. Why? I'm pretty confident I heard the sound of drums. Where? Over there. At intervals. Maybe I'm mistaken, but... whether you were or not, We'd better keep it to ourselves. And double the watch. All right, Joe! Kill it! Great work, men! Great work! Well, now we've got to finish clearing a runway. That'll be a big job. I wish we had a lawn mower. Well, if we work hard, we ought to finish by tonight. What are you going to do about crimp? He ought to have been here this morning, unless... Let's not worry about him now. He'll be back. Come on, boys. Come on, little monkey. Won't you have something to eat? Please don't feel frightened. I won't hurt you. Here, junior. Hey, junior. Water boy? Water boy? Tommy? Tommy? Tommy? Has anybody seen him? Ain't he around? Maybe he went to sleep somewhere. What if he's run off in that jungle And gotten lost? I'm going to look for him. Better take your gun, Pete. I got it. I'm going to look, too. Careful, Peggy. Tommy! Tommy? Tommy! Here's the water pan. He must be somewhere on the other side. Tommy? Tommy? Tommy? Here I am. Darling! I ought to wham the daylights out of you, Scaring everybody to death. I found Mr. Crimp. Where? Over there. Don't make any noise. He's asleep. Show me. Take him. Oh, Pete! We better get back to camp right away. You take the kid back. I'll stay here. Oh, Pete, no! Go on. Do like I say. I can take care of myself. Run! Give her a hand. I should think this is about as light as we can get it. Every ounce counts. We've got to climb fast If we're going to clear those trees. Hurry up. Here comes Peggy. She's got Tommy with her. Tommy. Thank heaven you're safe! Is he all right? He's all right. Where's Pete? He stayed back there. Back where? Where we found crimp. Crimp's dead. He's been killed. We'd better get out of here Before we're all killed. We're not going to leave without Pete. Here he comes. Uncle Pete! Uncle Pete! Tommy, go in. Poison dart. We'd better get him on the plane. No. You guys better get going. Is Tommy all right? Yes. He's safe. Tell him, his old man... I'm taking care of him. He's gone. Everybody on the plane. Quick! We can't leave him here like this. The lighter we are, The better chance we have of taking off. Go on. Move. Come on, Peggy. Go on, Vasquez. We can't spare any more time. Everybody on the plane, fast! Bring those water bottles! I hope she'll lift. They've got to be racing when we try it. Well, here we go. There goes an oil line. What happened? Oil line on the left engine let go. Can you fix it? Well, I can try. I hope we have enough time. Listen. They're going to attack us. No. As long as the drums sound, We're all right. It's when they stop drumming they'll attack. Come on, Joe. How much longer? We're nearly ready. They've got to know, Joe. Folks, I've got bad news for you. I can fix the engine so it will get us in the air... but it won't last long. We've got that mountain range to go over, And one engine can't make it with a full load. How many will it take? Four of us and the kid. I know these planes. I've tested them at the factory. I know exactly what they'll do. So that means five of us get out, and... the rest stay. There's need for only one pilot. That's bill. Wait a minute. You're as good a pilot as I am. I'll stay. I'll stay, too. I'm pretty fed up with things outside. I don't care much what happens. Now, look here, if you two want to play hero, That's all right with me, but... there's one rule we can use. Women and children first. I think the women Have as much right to a choice as the men. We could draw lots. No. Chance is too tricky. The wrong people might win. We've got to be logical. Excuse me. I think this is necessary. I don't think so. It hasn't been decided yet Whether you go or stay. Oh, yes, it has. I stay. Now, some of you want to live, Others deserve to, But the question cannot be decided emotionally. It's got to be decided by cold, hard logic, By one kind of savage or stretched by another, I have nothing to gain either way. I am the only one you can depend on To decide things logically. Stay where you are, Mr. Ellis. I'm the law now. Legally, the question ought to be decided By bill or Joe, But I for one am quite content To let the matter lie with Mr. Vasquez. Thank you, professor. Don't you see? You've all formed attachments, friendships. I'm the only one who hasn't. I wish you all well. So whether you like it or not, I'm going to choose for you. All right, Vasquez. Make your decision, But make it quick. We'll be ready to take off in a few minutes. Come on, Joe. The drums have stopped. That means they may attack soon. Well, what about it? Who gets to go? I have to think it over Until the plane is ready to fly, Mr. Ellis. Henry? Mm-Hmm? The same moon was shining When we got married. It was much larger then. And 35 years younger. Martha? Um-Hmm? Vasquez must not choose us. I know, dear. I know. I'm grateful to you, Martha... for our life together. Thank you, Henry. I'm going to speak to Vasquez. Vasquez... my wife and I have grown to like you. Can't allow that to influence my decision, professor. Oh, yes, you can. Mrs. Spengler and I Have only a short time left at the best. The others have a life before them. Leave us behind. I ask it as a favor. If there were more men like you, professor, There would be fewer men like me. Thank you. Joe? Sometimes people find out their mistakes too late, but... suppose things turn out that one of us goes back And one of us has to stay here? I think I know what you mean... 'cause I've wanted to say the same thing. All right, Joe. Let's turn them over. Vasquez, I want to talk to you. I am very rich, you know. If... If you and I were to go back On that plane together, I'd... I'd hire the finest lawyer in the world for you. Thank you. I'll think it over, Mr. Ellis. How's the kid? Asleep. Never thought I'd be the motherly type. Chances are you'll be going back with him. You stay, I want to stay, too. If Vasquez says you're to go, you'll go. I've got some dough saved up... Enough to give you and the kid a start. I'll give you a note to the airport, They'll let you have the money. All right, bill. O.K. Hit the throttle. Clear the prop. Give me more gas! All right. We're ready. Come on, Vasquez. Let's have it. First I pick bill. I think he's the one to fly the ship. Now, wait a minute... What he says goes. Right. Tommy's second, of course. Third, Alice, fourth, Joe brooks... What? Please let me finish. Fifth, miss Peggy. Well, what's the matter with me? You're not worth saving, Mr. Ellis. Mr. And Mrs. Spengler are remaining at their own request, And as for me, There was certainly no bravery involved in my decision. Now, you better get going. You haven't much time. I'm not going to leave Mr. And Mrs. Spengler. Me, neither. Oh, yes, you are. Martha and I... My choice goes! Get them on the plane. Get them in the plane! It's all right. It's not serious. Get him in the plane. Hurry up, there! Hurry up, all of you! In the plane! It's like having children of our own, isn't it? Yes. Five young people all going back. Well, I'll go and fix the fire. If we're taken alive, It means torture. Three shots left. When she's not looking. Can I lend you a hand, Martha? Henry, you old darling. Group and U.S. Department of Education
