Yeah, this is gonna be good. - Come on. Everything' s okay. But here's the thing. you've gone fishin' every year since before we knew you, and so far everything has never been okay and fine. And you've never been as far away as Florida. But that's why this trip is so nice. that's why it's so important. we're goin' to the Everglades. that's the biggie, right, Joe? - Yeah, the Everglades.

F. H. In the G.O. M.?" What's that stuff you was readin'? O. F. H., G.O. M.? What's that mean? that's Optimum Fishing Hour in the Gulf of Mexico. Hmm, alligators. Hey, Joe, listen to this. "Alligators will attack their prey, but not eat them immediately. - "Often, they will drag their unlucky half-dead victim... - [Horn Honking] "Into their cave, where they will let the carcass rot, nibbling on them at their delight." A-And this too. [Shudders] "Legend has it that alligators are vengeful creatures. "If threatened or disturbed, "they will become obsessed with their target, not resting... until they have successfully unleashed their retribution." - Ohhh! - Obsessed? Yeah, obsessed, man. I mean, they could follow you to the end of the world. Wow! Hey, check this out. Boy, holy smokes. Hey, Gus, we don't have to worry about that, right? - we're gonna be fishin', right? - Right, right, right, right. - Yeah. Hey, Joe, it-it's nice gettin' away, man. - Oh, yeah.

Hey, what kind of fish is that? - Ah, a grouper. - Grouper, huh? And what's this? that's a strawberry grouper. Strawberry grouper, huh? I thought it was a salmon. - Yeah, that's a strawberry grouper. - what's this one, Gus? - Kingfish. - Kingfish, huh? Yeah. Hey, Gus, if we had money, we' d set this up different. We' d catch a lot of fish. - Yeah, who needs it? - Yeah. - Guys who can't fish. - Exactly. L-Look at it this way. You was a great football player, right? - Yeah. - If a great football player got a bad football... - he's still a great football player. - Exactly. Hey, how about this clean, fresh Florida air? [Inhales] Hey, a real Florida palm tree in the flesh. Holy smoke! Gus, I never thought I' d see a palm tree. - I feel like a million dollars, Joe. - I feel like two million. [Laughing] let's go eat. - And then fish. - Yeah. No, no. You got the last one. it's on me. Forget about it. Hey, Joe, check out them ugly sticks. Hey, don't say that. - They gonna break. - [Woman] You got number nine ready? - [Man] Here you go. - let's sit over here. Hey, don't say that. Hey, Gus, I can't believe you. You tell me, "Look at these ugly chicks." I was gonna laugh right in their faces over there. I said, "Ugly sticks." For fishin'. Oh, I thought you said "ugly chicks"' cause this girl' s sittin' there. You gotta have ugly sticks here because they feed a lot of fishermen. - Hiya. - Hi. Y' all know what you want? Uh... Hey, Gus. What do you think, Gus? Should I get this Southern Plate? Then you can have my toast and my bacon. Yeah, then I'll get the Fisherman' s Feast, and you can have my sausage and pancakes. If you're gonna do that, why don't I get the Mariner and you can have the whole side of ham? Oh, never mind us. This happens all the time. Must be enjoyable for ya. May I suggest the Panama Platter? It really hit the spot. Oh, yeah? Thanks. Um... what do you think? Shall we get a couple of those? - Yeah, a couple of those. - [Waitress] Two of those? - A couple of those, yeah. - Yeah. Thanks. - Gus, check this out. - Yeah. - Pure Billy "Catch" Pooler. Watch this. - Okay. Back, drop. - Back, drop. - Y-you're flickin' too much. - I can't get the flick. - Okay, wait. Let me show you. Which is the flick? Which is the dip? Think of flick instead of flip. - Flick. - Flick, dip. See, I can't... I get the flick and the dip mix ed all the time. - Uh, pardon me. - Oh, sorry. - I couldn't help noticing you have a fishing lure on your key ring. - Yeah. - That wouldn't be a deadly invader, would it? - It is! - You fish? - Not professionally. You could call me a frustrated amateur. you're a frustrated amateur. [Laughing] - that's good. - I was just kiddin'. Just makin' a joke. - It was a joke. - Oh, yeah, yeah. What about you two? you're professionals, right? Well, I guess you could say that, in a way. we're semipro. We won a lot of fishin' medals and things like that. - Not lately, though. - Well, scout camp... That counts, doesn't it? Stuff like that. - The reason I ask is... Sorry. Sorry. - Oh. - Do you mind if I join you? - No, come on. Thanks. You see, my father was a professional fisherman. - [Joe] Really? - He was telling me... that he was working on the deadly invader. You know, I think this might have been one of his last original designs. - By the way, I'm Joe. - Oh, uh, Martin. - How ya doin'? - Martin Jeffries. Gus. Yeah. - Anyway, are you two married? - Uh, yeah, yeah. - Children? - No, they're our age. - No, I don't think that's what he meant. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Do you have children? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - They all get together. - they're great kids, though. - See, Fiona and I, we never had children. - Oh, geez. When Fiona died, I suddenly realized... I' d wasted so much of my life, you know? - I' d spent 20 years behind a desk. - that's a long time to sit. - you're 100% right. - Right, Joe? - I was always jealous of men like you. - Really? Of course, I'm changing all that now, you know. My life' s different. Listen, I won' t hold you up. Anyway, look, it was a real honor meeting you. - Hey, the pleasure' s ours. - Yeah, thanks. Thanks so much. And good luck with the fishing. - Yeah. - Hey, try fishing. You'll see. - I'll give it a try. - All right. he's a nice guy, huh? Hey, what kind of accent is that? Polish or somethin'? - I think it's Irish. - Yeah, Irish, Scottish. Here. I'm glad y' all didn't buy a bridge from that gentleman. Why? He seemed like a nice guy. He didn't try to sell us anything. - Seemed like a nice guy havin' a tough time. - Oh, really? - Poor guy just recently lost his wife, you know? - Yeah. Did you know you just recently lost your car? - there's a car just like mine! - Joe, that's your car! - It is! With my keys! - [Tires Screeching] - [Screaming] - Hey, Joe! Holy smokes! [Woman] it's simple. When we find that guy who stole my mom' s money and broke her heart, I'm gonna kill him. - Food. - What... What? - Food. - Oh, no. Come on. We already lost two hours. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? Okay. What happened? Oh, we just had ourselves a little boatin' accident. Some fella stole a car. - Big mess. - Oh, yeah? He didn't happen to look like this guy, did he? Well, that was him. - He was here! - Well, when did he leave? - A couple hours ago. - Was he alone? When he got here. Then he sat over at that table with a couple of fellas and... they chit-chatted for a while and... and he took their car. Those guys whose car was stolen, what about them? Oh, you shouldn't have any trouble findin' them. [Laughs] [Laughs] [Joe And Gus Panting] My poor car, Gus. My poor car. My poor feet. Hey. [Car Horn Honking] [Boy In Car] Hey, you dorks! [Bird Squawking] [Bird Squawking] This trip ain't even a one. it's a friggin' zero. - It could be worse, Joe. - How could it be worse? You can't get any lower than zero, right, Gus? Hey, at least we're alive. We almost got killed by our own boat. My life stinks, Gus. But it stunk a lot less when my car was in it. - Yeah. - That car meant a lot to me, Gus. I got memories of that car I can't even remember. Yeah, but at least we're goin' fishing. Yeah. - Hey, Joe? - Yeah? L-I was just thinkin; Say, 100 years ago we were goin' fishin; - This is what we' d be doin'. - What do you mean? Yeah, think about it. [Chuckles] This is how we' d get our boat to the water. So we can't let that guy ruin our Florida vacation, eh? Hey, maybe you're right. Yeah, and 1, 000 years ago, we wouldn't even have paved roads. Hey, that's right, Gus. It would be filled with rocks and everything, right? Y-Y-Yeah. And the boats would be heavier. that's right. We got the latest technology wood. This boat's light, right, Gus? Yeah, and guess what, Joe? A million years ago, we wouldn't even have wheels for our trailer. [Laughing] We wouldn't even have a friggin' trailer, right, Gus? A-A-And Gus, if it was that long ago, our brains would be smaller. - We wouldn't even think about anything like that. - Oh, man, yeah. - So, it may not be a ten yet, - Yeah. - But it definitely ain't a zero. - [Horn Honking] [Laughing] Hey, hey! - Hey, Gus, they're pulling over. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey, Gus. - Yeah? - Babes. You guys need a ride? Gus, what kind of knot did you tie? A double shambo figure eight. You went over, under, over. Uh, the shambo goes over, under, under. - Hey, Joe, trust me. it's over, under. - it's under, under. - Hi. - [Both] Hi. Hey, it's really nice of you girls to give us a ride. We really appreciate it. - Yeah. - you're welcome. it's really too bad about your car. I feel bad. - We feel bad too, yeah. - Yeah. Hmm. - Did you report the car stolen? - Yeah, with the deputy. ' Cause the sheriff was out fishin'. ain't that a bummer? Y-You know the... You know your license plate number, right? that's the one thing thatJoe does remember. [Laughs] that's right. Uh, "JGTT 542." - Can you... What is it? "J" what? - Wait. Could you do that again? - Maybe I'll bump into the police, and I can help you. - Yeah, that's a great idea. - Thank you. that's nice of you. - One more time. - "J" forJoe, "G" for Gus... - that's me. "T"for tuna, "T"for trout. - "5." I was five years old the first time I tasted beer. - Yeah. And "42" was Gus' s old football jersey before he dislocated both his knees. Yeah, but that's not how I hurt my knees, you know. I sleepwalk when I eat red meat. - Sleepwalk? - that's right. Hey, listen to this. One time at a July 4th barbecue we had... After it was over, Gus sleepwalked all the way over to the 7-11 on the interstate. Got wiped out by a motorcycle. Almost killed him. Hey, true story, I swear to God. - it's a true story. - Right, Gus? - Yeah, right. - Ex cuse us. Hey, we'll talk to you later. [Laughing, Whooping] Hey, hey, you know, Joe? Life is so unpredictable, man. One minute, we're draggin' our boat, next minute, we're gettin' a ride with babes! Hey, you know somethin' else? I think they find us attractive. - Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Notice that? Hey, maybe they think we're cute. - Yeah, yeah. - W-Why not? what's wrong with us? We have the license plate number. We know that it's a blue Barracuda. And if we see this guy, we're going to call the police. - Of course, we're gonna call the police. - Okay. - Hey, hey, remember the killer looks? - The what? - The killer looks. [Mutters] - Killer looks? Oh, Joe! Your memory' s so bad. In high school. We' d be sittin' in the bleachers and givin' the killer looks... to Susan Dix on and Marilyn Mitchell. - Oh, yeah! Killer looks! - Yeah. What we gotta do is figure out what to do with these guys. You know what? I was thinkin' of that low-down dir... that's if... - Hi. - Hi. what's wrong? Are you guys all right? Oh, we're good, yeah. Okay, well, um, look, I just need to ask you... The guy who stole your car... Was he carrying anything? Like a... Like a black bag or a suitcase or... Uh, it was... It looked more like a purse to me. Yeah, yeah, he was a man with a purse, yeah. Oh, yeah, well, this guy with the purse, did he maybe... tell you which way he was going or something like that? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. - Uh, no. that's all we know, really. - Let me ask you a question: How come you're asking so many questions? - Yeah. Well, it's because... The guy who stole your car... - No, the guy... - [Chattering, Gasps] - Hey, Joe, the beer! - Gus! Get the beer, Gus! - I got it, Joe. - Get the beer. Hey, Joe! Hey, good save, Gus! Good save! - [Screams] - [Rope Slipping] Oh, Gus! [Grunts] - J-Joe! - [Grunting] - Hey, Joe! - [Joe Screaming] - Hey, Joe! - [Grunts] Hey, hold on, Joe! I'm coming! [Grunting, Panting] - Thanks, Gus. - Hey. [Joe] Hey, Gus, I told you it was under and under. [Gus] Yeah, okay, Joe. Maybe you're right. - Hey, nice R.V., Gus. - [Horn Honking] - [Both Gasp] - [Honking Continues] Hey, Gus, is there any way to steer this thing? L-l-I don't know. We better find a way to stop it, though. - Where' d they go? - What? Th-they're gone. - The boat, the beer, everything. they're gone! - Weird. - Hey, Gus. - Huh? - The anchor. - Get it, Joe. Throw it. [Both Screaming] - [Crashing] - [Both Laughing] - Hey, Gus. - Yeah. - It was just like a ride. - Yeah. - [Train Whistle Blowing] - [Both] Uh-oh. - Train! - Train! - Hey, Gus, you pushing or pulling? - Pushin'. - it's stuck on something. - [Whistle Blowing] Joe, go get the... go get the anchor! - Hurry up! - I'm doin' it. Hurry up! - let's go. - [Whistle Blowing] [Both Scream] Boy, that was close, Gus. You know who I feel sorry for, Gus? - Who? - Those girls. You know, the babes. - Yeah. - I bet they're drivin' all around lookin' for us, right? Yeah, you're probably right, Joe. Hey, look at this setup, huh, Gus? Where' re you guys headed? Uh, we're goin' to the Everglades. - Hop in. - Hey, thanks. [Beer Bottles Rattling] [Railroad Crossing Bell Ringing] I usually use a 80-pound test line... with a Bluefin II 1955 stand-up rods with those uni-butts, so I can pull it out of the rod holder when the fish is pulling hard. Do you anchor or do you drift? We usually power drift along the break, if we can find one. - Yeah. - And set each hook bait with a different depth. Man, we know a ton of great fishin' secrets. Last year, the Everglades were like a feeding frenzy. No way you weren't gonna catch some beauties. don't worry about your boat. Ours is big enough for all four of us. - Hey, Joe! - Hey, Gus, that's my car! Hey, stop! We'll be all right now. I got my car. - Hey, where are you guys headin'? - Tigertail Lagoon. - Hey, we'll see you there. - Good luck. - Guys are lucky, ain't they? - Yeah. Oh, man, I know. I wish I was them. Hey, where is the guy that, uh, parked this car? - Yeah. - he's in the john. - What are you doin; Joey? - he's gonna get a little piece of Newark, Gus. - Oh, come on, Joey. It ain't worth it. - it's worth it, Gus. - No, it's not worth it, Joey! - it's worth it, Gus! - Hey, what about O. F. H. First? - it's worth it. [Mutters, Sighs] Oh, man. # [Whistles] # [Whistles] Hey! Hey! Look what you're doin' there. [Grunting] Hey, what's going on over there? Joe, what about O. F. H.? Man, we still got time. it's not worth it! it's not worth it! he's got a gun! - he's got a gun? Shoot! - Got a gun. Come on, Joe! he's got a gun! [Gus] Hurry up! - Hey, mister. Hey! - let's go! it's against the law to start your car while I'm pumping gas! Oh, boy, that was close, Gus. - That guy could' ve killed us, Joe. - I know. - Joe, what happened? - I went in. I was gonna hit him with the club, see. - He was lookin' for me. He was underneath the toilet. - Yeah, yeah. So I get up on top, and the club gets caught on this, uh, thing. - And I look, and he's got a gun. - Was it real? No, he's loadin' a water pistol. Yeah, it was real! - So I ran outta there right away, and I ran into you. - Yeah. Yeah. - Where was you goin'? - L-I was comin' in to help you. As soon as I tell you it was a gun, you was the first one in the car. - Yeah, that's why I ran first. I got longer legs, man. - Yeah, you were scared, Gus. [Sirens Wailing, Horns Honking] [Mutters] what's goin' on? - I don't know, man. Yeah. - God! There must be a fire or somethin', huh? Man. Hey, Gus, check in there. See if this guy touched anything. - I'll kill him. - Better not have touched our tapes. Yeah, the tapes are in there too. what's that? - A knife. - Holy smokes! - Yeah. - Hey, Gus, it looks like it's got blood on it. Sure does. there's blood on it, Joe. Hey, we could use it to scale our fish. Yeah, that's a good idea. We'll use it to scale our fish. [Joe] It feels good to get the car back, Gus. I'll tell you that. [Gus] Smells good too. Yeah. Holy smokes! Look at this place, Gus! - Yeah, this must be it, Joe. - Yeah. But the sign says "Rod & Gun Club,"Gus. Oh. Glory Glades must be a few miles away. - Yeah, this ain't it, huh? - Yeah. - it's probably just as nice. - I bet it's even nicer. - Yeah, that's right. - Yeah. So far, Gus, l-I don't like the landscaping, I'll tell ya that. Yeah, somebody ain't doin' their job, that's for sure. This must be where the workers stay. let's ask somebody. Yeah, let's go ask.

I don't think you want what else we got. - I guess we'll go check it out. - Yeah. that's the top of the line. I just cleaned her out. - [Bird Squawking] - Hey, hey, give me that! Friggin' slob. I'll tell you what, Gus. It doesn't look anything like the picture. Yeah, they should' ve sent us a new brochure if they're gonna change the picture like that. - Yeah. - Yeah, they got a lotta nerve callin' this first prize. - [Thunder Rumbling] - I wonder what the losers got. Six months in Sing Sing? - Yeah, maybe. - Careful. Why don't you go first? There might be rats. Go ahead, you're bigger. - Me? - Go ahead. [Joe Shudders] [Gus] it's okay. Come on in, Joe.

The guys who can't fish get these. they're show-offs. they're pleasure boats. here's one like our old one. - Yeah. - Holy smokes! - Whoo! - Why is it so expensive, Gus? - Because we bought ours used 20 years ago. - Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Joe, maybe we oughta just fish off the dock, like we used to do in the old days, yeah? Look, I don't care. You wanna just rent one? We'll rent one. Yeah, we can rent one. Then we'll buy a real nice used one when we get back home. - [Man] it's sad, isn' t it? - What? The Little Guy. that's what we call this boat. "The Little Guy." - Yeah! - Oh!' Cause you got all the big guys around... I see, yeah. Right. Phil Beasly, Sr. - Uh, Gus. - Uh, Joe. Yeah, the Little Guy' s sad. But you know what's sadder? Follow me, guys. [Chattering] - The Little Guy. - Yeah, but maybe he'll show us somethin' real nice. - Watch your step here, guys. - Yeah. # Down in the Everglades # [Alarm Beeping] - Hey, how much further? - Oh, just right up here. - I wanna show you guys somethin' different. - All right. - Something special. - Yeah. - Most of my customers just shop the showroom. - Yeah. But I can see you guys are professional fishermen. I'm sure you can judge this boat in the water. - we're semipro, not professional. - you've probably won some awards. - Yeah, we won a few. - Yeah. Oh, We've won a lot of' em. Yeah, well, that's good. Right here, guys. - Hey, Gus, it's the Ranger 250C. - Wow! Yeah, the 250C. Let me tell you what's sad about this boat. A lot of people look at this and believe it's only a dream. You fellas know anyone like that? - Yeah, us. - But there's nothin' wrong with lookin'. Good point. I cite this nudie photo as a prime example. - You men married? - [Both] Yeah. Then you'll understand me when I say you're allowed to look. - Yeah. - That is the American way. you're allowed all the eyeballing your eyeballs can eyeball. you'rejust not allowed to touch. you're not allowed to play. Well, I got good news for you guys. Go right ahead. Touch. Play. - Ex cuse me. - Thanks a lot, Phil. - Yeah. - We might as well, Gus. It can't hurt none, right? Yeah, sure. Oh, man! - Wow, look at this. This is something. - Man! How about this guy? Tryin' to give us the old salesman pitch. With his nudie girl photo. He never saw a girl like that in his life. - Yeah, yeah. He tried to pull one on us. - Yeah. - Guys? - [Both] Yeah? Someone I want you to meet. This is my assistant. Julie, this is Gus and Joe. - Hello, guys. - [Both] Hi. I'll sign those papers now. Nice boat. You guys look great in it. - Thanks. - I'm tellin' you, that baby' s cryin; - Screamin'. - Yeah. - No, the boat. - Yeah, that's what I was talkin' about. Let me tell you something, guys. [Clears Throat] If I'm not honest with you, I'm not lyin' to anyone. I started this business because I'm a fisherman and a boatman, not because my time equals sales plus commission minus overhead. To me, it's the people that matter. - Yeah, people. - Yeah. People, yeah. I wouldn't want you to fall in love with... just for example... A boat like mine. that's the Waveliner II. She' d be overkill for you fellas. - Yeah, overkill. Too much. - Yeah, overkill. The truth is, this boat you're standin' in, the Ranger 250C... Gentlemen, this boat... Well... can you just see the neighbors? - Yeah, the neighbors. - The neighbors. - Wazinski. [Laughing] - Yeah. Can you just see them? I'm tellin' you, that's the best part of my job. Not keepin' boats afloat, but keepin' a man' s self-image above the water. - Yeah, self-image. - Self-image, yeah. Y-You see, Phil, we were thinkin' about buyin' the, uh, Little Guy? - Yeah. it's too, um... - But it's too, uh... - Cheap? - [Both] Yeah, cheap. - Where do you fellas fish? - Glory Glades. Fellas, are you familiar with the phrase... "No one fishes Glory Glades"? - No. - I never heard that. Guys, if you learn anything from me today, remember the two words... Tigertail Lagoon. - Hey, that's where Bubba and J. P... - J. P., yeah. - We got a couple of friends of ours fish over there. - Yeah, yeah. it's where I fish. Here, have a pen. - Hey. - Hey. Yeah. - Phil, would you sign this for me? - Oh, yeah. Gladly. Are you guys okay? - Fine, thanks. - Yeah, fine. - Okay. Thank you. - Thank you, Julie. Thank you, Julie. Uh, Phil, you know, there's no way we can afford... Gus, prices are relative to your outlook and how you approach a matter. - For example, I say ten dollars. - Yeah. You say two. that's eight dollars worth of play, my friends. - Yeah, it's eight dollars. - Yeah. Can we not disagree on somethin'? - We can't... We can't disagree. - No. I think we reached that place already, minutes ago. Now here's my point. - And you can take this to the bank. - Yeah. Think for a moment of the words "easy payments." - Easy payments. - Easy payments. I'm talkin' 810 easy payments... they're easy now... of $39.95. - $39.95. that's not bad. - No. Each. that's $39.95. This boat, your boat. Think about it. All we need is a signature, and you've already got a pen. - Yeah. - Ex cuse me. What do you think? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Yeah. It depends on what you're thinkin'. - Yeah, well... P.S. there's a 30-day money-back guarantee. So it's a test-drive. You don't like it... which you will... you call, we come, we pick it up. End of story, see you next time, no questions asked. - that's like free rent, Gus. - Yeah. You guys, if you need anything... I mean anything... just say out loud the word "Phil"! - [Chuckles] - Ex cuse me. - Hey, Phil! - Hey, Phil! Hey, Gus, did you ever think we' d own a boat like this? Oh, man, no. Look at the navigation, Joe. - Yeah. what's this? - that's the three-dimensional sonar. - Hey, Gus, I know we gotta bring back the knife. - Yeah. But do you think we could get a little O. F. H. In first? Yeah, we do a little O. F. H., and then we take the knife back. - [Sonar Beeping] - Hey, Gus, look at this! - A hundred yards north of here. Look at all that fish activity! - Wow! Hey, Joe, they all around us, man! [Laughs] - Hey, we're surrounded by fish. - Hey, we made it, Joe! Hey, you know what, Gus? This is the first time on this trip that life is good. - Hey, a ten. - A ten plus. [Together] Borderline 11! [Both Laughing] I can't wait to try out the new "flick dip," you know? - Flick, dip. - [Gus Grunting] [Screaming] [Screaming] - What happened, Gus? - You knocked me over with the flick. - Gus! - Oh, no! - [Sonar Beeping] - Joe, look at the fish activity here! Whoo! - [Screaming] - Hey, what-what-what? - Look! Gus! - [Screaming Continues] - Let go of the pole! - Hey, it broke! Get off! Get off! [Gus] what's it say, Joe? what's it say? - I can't find it. Ignition. Ignition. - Huh? [Man In Small Boat] Shut it down! - [Screaming] - [Both] Sorry. Slow down! Shut it off! - Let me have it. - it's broke! it's broke! Try shuttin' the key off, Gus. - Shut the what off again? - Shut the key off! - You broke it. - Yeah, it broke. [Screams] Sorry! Oh, I feel bad, Gus. Move out of the way! Move out of the way! - Sorry. - Hey, Joe, where are we goin'? - Hey, J... J. P! - Hey, it's J. P! Bubba! - Oh, Joe! - Oh, Gus! - Joe, get in! Get in! - Gus! Gus! Joe, the knife! Get the knife! Get it, Joe. Get it! - Gus! Oh! - Get it! - I can't get it. - Come on, Joe. You get it? - Did you get it, Joe? - No, I can't get it, Gus. You couldn't get it, Joe? Ohhh! Gus, what are we gonna do? We don't... - I don't know, Joe. - I can't believe it. I can't believe we lost that knife. - Me either. I can't believe it. - That was everything to us. - Everything. - I know. Oh, we in big trouble, Joe. [Man] Hey, there they are! - Gus! - let's move! Slow down! Where are you goin'? - Why are they chasin' us? - I don't know why. Look like they're gainin' on us, Joe! Get outta here! it's not our fault! It broke! The thing broke! Leave us alone! We got enough problems! - Watch those bushes, Gus! - [Screaming] [Screaming Continues] Watch out! [Screaming Continues] that's my boat! [Both Panting] - Hey, Phil! - Hey, Phil! Hey, Phil, we decided to bring the boat back before the 30 days was up. - Right, Joe? - Yeah. Look, Phil, this stuff all broke. You better get it all fix ed. Thanks, anyway. Yeah, thanks, man. You know, you need better material. Yeah. Sorry. [Screaming] These guys are a two-man disaster area. They just bought a boat and destroyed it in less than an hour. Look, these idiots won' t get very far. Now They've got my map. It might take me another day to find them. But I will find them. don't worry. And when I'm finished with them, I'll know where the money is. we're gonna be working every weekend for the rest of our lives, Gus. How come? Because that boat cost more than our house. At least we'll be home on time. Wrong. we're gonna be home a day earlier, and that's worse than gettin' there on time. Besides, that friggin' knife is somewhere at the bottom ofTigertail Lagoon. - In any case, we're goin' home. - [Tire Blows Out] - Flat. - Flat. I got it, Gus. [Dog Barking] - Hey, Gus. - What? - what's this? - what's what, Joe? Look, look. It looks like a map of somethin'. Joe, it's a map to the money andjewels. What jewels and money? Joe, your memory' s so bad. Remember the $2-1/2 million in stolen jewels and money... the guy on TV said was hidden away? - This is it? - Yeah. Who cares about the knife? We get the reward anyway. Hey, w-we got a map to $2-1/2 million dollars! - Hey, we're gonna get the reward anyway! - we're gonna be rich! - we're gonna be rich... - [Muttering] Wait, wait, wait, wait! - Gus, Gus, Gus, listen! Gus, Gus! Listen. - Huh? Yeah. Listen. Who cares about the reward is right. Forget about the reward. let's just take the 2-1/2 million in money and jewels. we're millionaires! Millionaires, Gus! we're rich! Joe, that guy stole that from 43 women. that's a whole lot of broken hearts. Yeah, i-i-it's not nice. We wouldn't like it if it was somebody in our families. - We can't take it. - But think, Joe. Not only is it a lot of women... That means a lot of rewards. it's a lot of rewards! - it's more than one reward. we're rich! we're rich! - we're gonna be rich. - we're gonna be rich. - we're rich. that's right. Instead of one reward, we get a bunch of rewards. - we're really rich now. And we're picking up... - [Muttering] [Together] we're goin' fishin'! - Holy smokes! Look at this place, Gus. - Oh, yeah.
