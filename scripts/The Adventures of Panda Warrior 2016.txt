Entire populations were starving. There was no more peace to be found. No peace anywhere in the world. Hey! Think you're a great fighter? Uh-uh. - You wanna get hurt? - Uh-uh. Then why are you asleep right in the middle of my training? Huh? Captain, sir. No, I wasn't really sleeping. I was just closing my eyes, that I could gain more insight, you see. Oh, is that true? You gain more insight? Absolutely. OK. Then go ahead. Uh. Sorry, sir. I mean, yes, sir. All right. Show me. I want you to attack me with your insight. Hyah! Hyah! What are you doing? I'm warming up. - You warmed up now? - Not yet. Let's go! If you don't come at me soon, then I'll just have to hit you first! Huh? Ridiculous. How do you plan to fight the enemy and protect your country? Uh, why must we fight each other? If we can live together in harmony, then there's no reason to fight. - We can live in peace. - Not true. There is no peace here. Peace doesn't exist. The world as we know it is hard! You're wrong. There is a place without any war. A peaceful place where people live in harmony, and it's called Merryland. Grandpa, I'll prove that Merryland really does exist. And I'll prove that my grandpa never lied to me. Ah. What a beautiful meteor shower. Wait a minute! Ahhh! Hurry, men! Go! The enemy is near! Get ready! But, sir, it's the enemy! Run! You coward! How can you retreat at a time like this? Ah! Don't chase me! Somebody, somebody help! Grandpa, it won't be long now. I'll see you soon. Ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah! Ah, this must be heaven. It's so beautiful here. - Aggh! Pig? - Uh-huh. That's right. Wait. A talking pig? Why not? Well, if a panda can talk, then why can't I? Huh? Wait. A talking panda? Where? What panda? I don't see any pandas here. How 'bout now? Oh, wow. It's a panda. What's a panda bear doin' in that thing? It's called a mirror. A mirror? Mirrors are made of glass. Hmm. Well, this one's special. Oh. Oh, no! You sure it's a mirror? - Yep. - No, that can't be me! Mmm-hmm. This makes no sense. I'm not a panda, and there's no such thing as pigs who can talk. Impossible! Huh. He really doesn't know how to fly? Hi-yah! Hey! You bumped into me. Sorry. I didn't know you were there. Help! Wait a minute. Where am I? Wow. Is this place for real? Whoa. Ahh! What a weird dream! Where'd I get these mittens? And what's with this black and white fur suit? Don't tell me I really turned into a panda? Can you see my tail? Is it back there? We're wasting a lot of time here. I have things to do. Noooo! What do I do now? I don't want to be a panda. Put me back the way I was. Chill. Everything will be fine. Now that I saved you. I've never seen a place like this before. Where am I? This is Merryland. Huh? Did you say Merryland? What, are you deaf? Of course. Where else did you think we were? Hmm? Merryland really exists. Grandpa told me the truth. All right, it's true! Ha ha! Hey, is something wrong with your butt? You gonna be all right? Yeah, sure. Uh-huh. Thanks. I guess I should introduce myself. I'm Patrick. Who are you? - Peggy Skyflyer. - Peggy Skyflyer? - Yep. - So you can really fly? Why is that so surprising? Hmm. Yeah, right. I guess nothing should be surprising at this point. Exactly. You're a talking panda after all. But I wasn't a panda before. I have no idea why I turned into a panda all of the sudden. Oh, I see. So maybe you're not a real panda. Huh? Looks real to me. What else do you call a black-and-white bear? But are you the legendary Panda Warrior? Huh? Panda Warrior? Hmm. Well, it's pretty hard to imagine you as much of a warrior. Yeah, yeah. Not so much. Ha ha. You got yourself the wrong panda. Now! Whaaa! Oooh, whaaa! And, launch! Gross! That is so stinky! Ah! Whoo! Well, would you look at that? Who knew? Pigs really can fly! Well, of course. See ya, panda! I'm on a mission. Got a lot to do. Wowee! It's beautiful here. Merryland is such a wonderful place. Hey, there. Huh? Oh, well, hi. What's that? Oh, hey. How's it goin', guys? Hey, ah... - Hee-ya! - Not again! Help! Hiyah! Wow. That was amazing, but why were they attacking me? The Phantom Army Cats are all mind-controlled. - Phantom Army? - Mmm-hmm. By the Evil Master. What? But wait. I thought Merryland was supposed to be a place of peace and harmony. It was many years ago. Why isn't it anymore? Unfortunately, most of Merryland is under the control of the Evil Master. It's no longer the paradise it once was. Isn't there anyone who can defeat the Evil Master? No. No one has been able to. The only one who can is a true hero. And who's that? The legendary Panda Warrior. Oh. Hmm. You may be a panda, but you're certainly no warrior. Hmm. That's what I've been tryin' to tell ya. Hey! Not so fast! Hey, where you goin'? Ah, oh, oh! All right. Why are you following me? Uh, well. I'm afraid the Phantom Army will come back and you don't want me joining up with them, do ya? I can tell you're a really nice person. Otherwise, you wouldn't have saved me, would ya? Huh? What else could I do? And I'm truly grateful for it. I mean, I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't come along. Hey, knock it off, all right? And don't follow me. But... That's the Evil Master's dark forest. Set one foot inside and his army could easily find you. Hey, so we're not goin' in there, right? When night falls, there'll be many army patrols. It's a dangerous place, especially for you. Just stay out here if you want to be caught. Heeeyah! Hey, wait for me! - Hey, calm down, will ya? - Who can be calm? Shhh! You have to be quiet. If you aren't careful, the big monster, who lives here, will find us, all right? There's a monster in here? A big one, but you see, no one who's ever seen it has ever returned alive. No survivors have ever returned from the monster's clutches. Now I'm really scared! - Hey! - Just kidding. You're pretty gullible, aren't you? Whoaaah! Oh, no! Help! What is that scary thing? That's a lot of teeth! You think he's mad at us for some reason? Oh, yeah? Ha! Yah! Hey, hey. Help! What's going on? Watch out, spider, here I come! Yah! Yah! Take that! Hey, wait. - Oh, no. - Help! What're we going to do? I thought you had this figured out. Be quiet! Unless you want to be spider bait. We gotta get out of here. This is it! Huh? Wow. That was amazing! You're awesome! Oh, hey, wait. Let me help you with that. Starting a fire is harder than it looks. Fine. - Need some help? - I got this. - Here. - I'm almost done. I think I got it. I almost saw an ember. Hey! Wait, how'd you do that? It's an invention called a lighter. Amazing! You can make a fire without hurting your paws. Mmm-hmm. Hey, let me take a closer look at it. - Mmm-hmm. - Cool, thanks. Whatever. Uh, how exactly does this thing work? Here. Let me show you. I can't breathe. It's dangerous to play with fire. You OK? Yeah. It's pretty obvious you need to take me with you on your journey. I'll fight the Evil Master, too. No! But you need some help, don't you? - No way! - Why not? I'll do whatever you want me to. Really? Sure, just ask. I'll do whatever you say. Hmm. All right. Fine, then. In that case, go join the Evil Master's side. - That'll help us out a lot. - OK, got it. Uh... am I that useless? Yes! Hey. Why do you wanna help? I wanna help because the world's in chaos right now. And I don't want Merryland to be that way. The Merryland that I've heard of is supposed to be a peaceful place. A place where everyone can live in peace and harmony, and I wanna protect that peace. I'm on a mission. I have to go. To spy on the Phantom Army. But I've no time to take care of you. I can take care of myself. Don't you worry. I hope so. I can't be responsible for your safety. Are you kidding? I'm a real expert at being careful. I can take care of you, too. I'm good on my own. Taking care of yourself is enough. Really? Then you'll let me come along? Mmm. It's not up to me. King Leo will make the final decision. Oh, I love it. I give you my word. I won't let you down. I won't ever let you... Whoa! - Sorry. - Oh, man, I totally regret it already. Uh, you can't go through life with regrets, but no more green gas! Hey, it's not fair. Pigs can eat whatever they want. I can only eat bamboo shoots. - Whatever. - Boring, right? I'll tell you, Skyflyer... It's not safe here. - Run while you can. - What's that? Are you talking in your sleep? Bet you're dreaming about that spider fight, huh? Run! Now! Once again, you totally saved us. Quiet down. Well, I can't blame you for resting. I'd take a break, too, if I were you. I said, "Run." "Run?" What was that? What d'you say? Hmm? I said, "Run," before it's too late. Ah? The Dragon Necklace. Where did you get that necklace? - Huh? - You heard me. - Start talking. - It was my grandfather's. - A family heirloom. - Stop talking! That is Princess Angelica's necklace, your grandfather stole it. No, he didn't. My grandpa's not a thief. He was. A thief never admits his true nature. Your grandfather was a slimy, stinking crook! How dare you insult my grandpa! Now you will pay for your grandfather's crime! No one insults my grandpa! Grrrr! Take it back, right now. No. I refuse to take back a single word, panda. - Yah! - Too slow! Hey, enough! I win! Now, why did you attack us? A real Kung Fu Master refuses to be ambushed. Huh. Guess that didn't work out for ya. You just wait, pig. I will defeat both of you. I demand that you untie me. Not a chance. I don't trust ya. And you haven't apologized. You can leave me here for an eternity, but I refuse to apologize. Now you did it. Just because you're big doesn't mean you are mighty. Huh. Wha. Ohhh. Thank you. You can go. Uh, huh? You mean, you're releasing me? You know nothing about my grandpa. Oh, all right. I apologize. You happy? Hey! What's going on? What'd you do that for? You're sure you're not the Panda Warrior? Of course not. What did I do now to make you think otherwise? Huh? - What are you doing? - Shhhh. We're pretty close to the onion village. It must have been taken over by those soldiers. Wait! Try to stay calm. Let's see what we can find out first. Right. Show him what happens when you disobey. If you try to escape, then you, too, will be punished. Enough. I can't just sit here while he bullies those onion things. Don't risk it. We're completely outnumbered. Weird onion animals or not, it's inhuman. Who's human? I'm a pig. Hey. Here I come! That's my pig. Me... Ow. Run, Patrick! Whoa! He knows magic. He must be a tree spirit. I am the one and only Phantom Warrior. Yeah, big deal. I'm here to destroy all evil forces. Well, we'll see about that. Whoa! Ahhhh! Take that! And that! It's the Mantis. What, does this little pipsqueak want a piece of me, too? Hah. I may be green, but I'm mean. I am a force to be reckoned with. Get lost, bug! Move it! Hey, he just said, "Your grandpa's a fool." What? No one insults Grandpa, except Grandma. Hmm. Course not. We all know who the real fool is. Now apologize to my grandpa! You hear that, you mean tree? Take that. Sorry, I lost a little bit there with the, you know, he was talkin' smack about my grandpa. So, what should we do with him now? Let's see. - Allow me to help you. - Wow. Are you the legendary Maestro Ginseng, the Master of Sonic Arts? Yes, and I have come here to help you. But you can just call me Jimmy. Oh, just Jimmy, huh? Sure. I thought you always worked on your own. So, why would you want to help us? Because from the moment I saw you, I knew you were different. I think you could save Merryland. That's why I've decided to help you. Weird. Better. He is now cured. What is the meaning of this? How did I end up here? You were taken over by the Evil Master. But that root saved you. Rubbish! I am the one and only Phantom Warrior. I can't be mind controlled. Oh, really? I see. Interesting. So you meant to attack the onion village, huh? No way! How dare the Evil Master take control of my mind like that! I'm going to go find him right now and take him down. Hold on! If you could beat him, you wouldn't have been mind-controlled. Enough. No insect bosses me. Jimmy, you freed the crazy tree from the Evil Master's control. Could you free the entire Phantom Army, too? I always need time to rest after I perform The Song of Peace. I need time to recover. I can't free them all. Well, that's weird, but I understand. You've helped us out a lot already. The Phantom Army will eventually return here. You should go now. Farewell, panda. Goodbye. And thank you, Jimmy. Thanks, Jimmy, for your magic. Come on. Hey, how long will it take to get to the Rainbow Hole? Long. I guess we better move our onions. - Hey. - What now? Company. Huh? Uh-oh. Onions, take cover! Perfect timing. Saves us the trouble of finding you. You guys somehow managed to break the spell, which means that you must be part of the rebellion. Enough threats. How about a little fire? Patrick. That big ox just insulted your grandpa. I didn't hear him say anything. Well, he was thinking it. How could you possibly know what he's thinking? Hmm. I just know. Do you know what I'm thinking right now? Hmm. How to escape? Well, I know where I'm going. Behind this bush over here. Let's attack together and we'll overwhelm him. Together? I'll do just fine on my own. Huh? Hiyah! Whaa! I am the Master! Oh, look. What an incredible insect he is. He's pretty cool. Ready? Bernie, Manny? Let's get him. Come on. Well, guys, let me know how it all turns out. Metal beak to the rescue! Whaa-haa! Ya-haa! Now, Billy! Take that! Here I come! High flyin' Bobby Bunny at your service. Whoo hoo! Let's do this! And don't forget me. Yours truly, Shadowfeet. Great footwork, but what the heck is he? I'm a river horse, here to fight. - A hippo? - Shadowfeet. You came, too? Yes, indeed. Hey, look. It's GoGo Goat. Spinny the Monkey and GoGo Goat, you're all here! We're all together again, at last. I'll destroy all of you! Ready? Wonder Seven battle array now! Bobby Bunny. I'm on it. Spinny's blaster does it again. - Out of my way! - Oh, no. The Wonder Seven battle array isn't powerful enough. Uh-oh. You're goin' down, panda. Ole. O-later. I'm Billy Beakman, a trained metal beak. You saw how I broke that huge rock, right? Yeah. That's a pretty amazing skill. His biggest skill is talking non-stop for three days. Ah, that's an old record. I can manage five days now. Want me to share with you everything's that's happened in those five days? Here. Fetch. Yum. That's the only way to shut him up. Come on. I'm high-flyin' Bobby Bunny, at your service. Need to cool off? No, I'm fine. I'm fine! I'm fine. Hello, there. I'm Shadowfeet, a river horse. But, you're a hippo. Uh-uh. No, I'm not. I am a river horse. You are a hippo. He just said that he's a river horse. That's right. I am a river horse, just like she said. Look, you say you're a river horse and I wanna believe you, but my eyes say... I think he's made it quite clear that - he's a river horse. - Yes, I have. Despite what you think you see, I'm a river horse. Then I'm a bumblebee. You're a hippo! I am not a hippo. I'm Shadowfeet, the river horse, I tell ya. At least admit you're a hippo horse. No. I am a river horse. I am not a hippo. I am a river horse! Get it straight! All right, all right, whatever. You're a river horse, OK? You crazy hippo. Are you happy now? Yes. That's better. I'm Bruce Barkley, the canine crusader. Hello. Ooh, that one hurt me. Below the belt. Hmm. He'll feel that later. Hi. Mwah. Hello, Patrick, how are you? Nice to meet you, GoGo Goat. You should try sleeping with cucumber slices on your eyes. Really. Your patches will vanish overnight. Trust me. It really works. Oh, thank you. This is Spinny, the genius monkey. He's a brainiac from Merryland. He invented every one of the weapons I use. - Hello. - Hello. I just got to say I really admire all your work. Hmm. The power isn't strong enough. I'll have to go back to my lab and increase it. I take everything I said about him back. Together, we're known as the Rebellion. The Rebellion of the Seven Wonders! Even if we all can't be geniuses, we're strong. Hmm? Mm... Hello, everyone. We're back. I brought my friends, and Patrick the Panda. We can find out if he's the Panda Warrior or not when we bring him to meet King Leo. He'll know for sure if he's the one. So, I take it you have roots here? Mmm-hmm. Where are your defense forces? They're all here. - Just the seven of you? - Mmm-hmm. Well, that's more than sufficient. We are the best seven wonders. Never mind the others. No matter who the enemy is, whether they're the Phantom Army or their Evil Master, I can K.O. them in round one with one talon tied behind my tail. - Mm. - Mm-hmm. Fetch. He is big and round and black and white. You're the Panda Warrior, aren't you? Oh, no. That's not me. I'm very flattered, though. It's just like the legend said. He's big, fat, black and white. It's real nice to meet you, Panda Warrior. But you see, I'm not. Got to hurry. I need to report to King Leo. Your majesty. Greetings. King Leo, we're back, and these are my brave friends who have come here with me because they want to join our team, and this is Patrick Panda. He's wearing the ancient Dragon Necklace. Maybe he is the legendary Panda Warrior, but that remains to be seen. Look, the necklace is glowing! This is indeed the Dragon Necklace. Like I told you, he is the Panda Warrior. He is not the legendary Panda Warrior. Oh, dear. That's what I said. How could a coward be the Panda Warrior? The Panda Warrior should be strong and brave, just like me. Here, fetch! Go, go, go, go, go! You're all tired after your long journey. Let us rest first. Ah, Grandpa. Why isn't Merryland the way you described it? The world changes every single day and Merryland is no exception to that rule, Patrick. Is that true? Mmm-hmm. Five years ago, a terrible disaster befell Merryland. First, an animal that I had never seen before suddenly appeared here to rescue us. The legendary Panda Warrior? Yes. You see, the Dragon Ball of Light powers Merryland and it used to also maintain the peace. It was guarded by Hope and Faith, the two heavenly whales, until one day when Hope absorbed far too much power from the Dragon Ball. The poor creature lost its mind and suddenly began destroying Merryland. It was then that the legendary Panda Warrior came down from the heavens. He quickly defeated Hope, turning her back to her normal self, restoring peace to Merryland. To show her appreciation for his bravery, Princess Angelica presented him with the Dragon Necklace. Then the Panda Warrior returned to his own world, with the magical Dragon Necklace, but during the ceremony, a despicable rat with a despicable plan snuck into Merryland from an evil parallel dimension. Using his dark magic, he merged Hope and himself into one, declaring himself the Evil Master of all Merryland, transforming himself into a terrifying nine-headed snake. He was too powerful for anyone to resist. He destroyed everyone who disobeyed him and then, he took Princess Angelica prisoner. Most of Merryland's citizens were bewitched and forced to form his Phantom Army. So, you can see how desperate everyone of us are, for the Panda Warrior to come back and rescue us, as he did before. I'm sorry. I wish I was the Panda Warrior, but I'm not. Patrick, Panda Warrior is nothing more than a mythical name. Whoever has faith and courage is the true Panda Warrior of legend. But sir, I'm nothing more than a useless coward. Don't you know there's no one in the world who could look down upon you than yourself. Our only hope lies in the return of the long-awaited Panda Warrior, Jin Long. Grandpa? You are his descendant? - I see. - Huh? Wait a minute. The Panda Warrior came and rescued you five years ago, right? But by then, my grandpa had already passed away. He can't be your Panda Warrior. I heard from Princess Angelica the time in Merryland moves differently than the outside world, so the timing makes perfect sense. It appears to me that your Dragon Necklace is the strongest evidence of that. Your grandfather giving you the necklace and your arrival here at this time is more than a coincidence. That is something to consider, Patrick. Well, I'm convinced my grandfather was the Panda Warrior And I must keep his reputation, and so I will help you save Merryland from the Evil Master. Huh? What do you mean, you'll help? Is this some kind of a joke? And how is it that you suddenly believe that you can save Merryland? I found my courage and passion. All right, then, prove it to me. Why, I oughta... OK. So, that is your courage and passion? Hiiiiiyaaaa... I'll never give up. Ah. Give up now. I'll never, ever give up. Then catch me. If you can't even beat me, how is it that you expect to beat the Evil Master? I understand, so please, King Leo, train me to defeat him. You think you have the courage it takes to become a warrior? - I do. - Very well. In that case, I will train you, Patrick. - Yes! - You all train yourselves, understood? Yes, sir. Wow, what a wonderful place. Doubt you'll be saying that later. Oh. I should have figured. Your first training task is to use these lilies to jump across the river. Sounds simple enough. - You really think so? - Haha. Yeah, sure. I hope your other tasks are tougher than this! Whoa. Whoa! These flowers have teeth! Oh, didn't I warn you? Sorry. My bad. They're piranha flowers and they're hungry, so be careful to not become their lunch. Hey, what kind of training is this? Trying to get me eaten alive? You'll have to manage on your own, or it wouldn't be training, now would it? And one more thing. These lilies have a surprise inside. What are you talking about? Uh-oh. Don't look, GoGo. Ah, my tail! Let go of my tail! Huh? The lake is so shallow. I don't need to jump to get across. I can just walk. Yeah, well, if I were you, I'd run! Give me one good reason. Uh, this lake is full of piranha fish. That's one. I said, "Run." Go Panda, go! I finished. I passed. Sorry, you failed the test, unless you complete it without getting wet. Huh? Again! Ooh, ooh, aah! This water hurts! So, your majesty, what exactly do you have in store for me next? - Look there. - Yah! What, more water? A piranha lake and now a piranha river? Don't worry, there are no fish to be afraid of in this river. This time it's extremely simple. All you need to do is fill the two buckets with water. And that's all there is to it? Well, not exactly. I knew it couldn't be that easy. I got this one. No! Not again! This one is a bit more dangerous. - Peggy Skyflyer? - Huh? Please demonstrate. Uh, yes, sire. Whaaaa! Huh? Now, it's your turn. OK. The world certainly is full of surprises. Patrick, you truly are the chosen one. You can keep me here, but the citizens of Merryland must not be hurt. You are a creature born of the Dragon Ball and when you are gone, the Dragon Ball will disappear. I will not be tricked by you. What do you want? You shall see. The poison water will drain away the goodness in your heart. When the Dragon Ball is drained of its goodness and finally turns dark and evil, I will absorb its energy and become more powerful than you can imagine. When that day arrives, nothing will be able to stop me. I'll conquer Merryland first and move on to the rest of your world. The Panda Warrior's coming back for you. I think not, Princess Angelica. Even your previous Panda Warrior would find it next to impossible to defeat me now. I still have faith that the panda will come and save us all. That's because you have no idea of the ways of the world. Your fate lies here, Princess. Patrick, now you understand the challenges of the world. Always treasure your Dragon Necklace. Hold on to it. In your most desperate moment, call upon its power, and use it to save yourself. You have earned your magical sword. I sincerely hope you can help us defeat the Evil Master and save Merryland. I will do my best. Wait just a minute. We can't let him be the leader just because of his grandpa. I object! What do you suggest we do then? I challenge him to be the leader. Patrick, do you accept the challenge? We should unite to fight the Evil Master, not fight each other. What if I lose or get hurt or something? Hah. That's because you know I'll defeat you. Maybe so, but if you really want a challenge, let's see who can defeat the Evil Master first? Right. You're on! But you're gonna lose. The Evil Master lives in a floating castle. Unfortunately, it has no fixed location, so it's impossible to know where it is at any given time. Oh, dear. I don't want to spend the rest of my life searching for some floating castle. What should we do, Patrick? My master, the Fox Elder, is a magician. She might be able to help us out. Then we should go and find her right away. - Right. Huh? - No! She doesn't trust anyone. Except for maybe the Panda Warrior. Huh? Listen carefully. This is a piece of the floating castle's foundation stone. It's very rare and contains mysterious magical powers. Take it with you and it will lead you to the castle's location. Yeah! This is going to be lights-out for the Evil Master. And take this. It has a special note inside. Open it if you should ever find yourself in terrible danger. Understand? Yes, Fox Elder. Thank you for your guidance, ma'am. You're welcome. Where are the Seven Wonders? They should be here. Huh? I sure hope they're not in danger. Help me. Hi, GoGo Goat. No, I wasn't scared. Are you all right? Everything OK? I'm fine, but... GoGo, what happened to everyone? It was awful. The Phantom Army attacked us. Where's everyone else? I don't know. Bruce Barkley dug a hole and hid me in it, but I'm afraid everyone else may have been captured. Oh, no. Forget about finding the Evil Master. The others may be part of the Phantom Army now. GoGo, please don't give up. Who else can save them, but us? We have to do it. But first, we need to find out where they are. - I can't right now. - But why? Because I need to take a shower. I'm all dirty from hiding. I need to freshen up before I can help out. Uhh. This way, guys. Why don't you just let me take them? You can't. Look over there. Whoa! All right, finally. So how do we get all the way up there? If Peggy Skyflyer was here, she'd know. I have a plan. Huh? Your horn is nothing but a fake. Fake is such a strong word. Can't a girl have a few beauty secrets? Hah! There she is! Peggy Skyflyer, it's us! Looks like she's been turned into a Phantom Army soldier. You dare to enter the castle without permission? You are all doomed! Nice try, but your little darts won't hurt me. Huh. We'll see about that. I'll inform the Phantom General you're here and we'll destroy you all! Even when she's under mind control, she has no sense of direction. Don't let her go. We gotta capture her. You got it. How you want her cooked? Don't hurt her. Ah, you're no fun. I gotcha. This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you. I bet Manny Mantis and the others are bewitched and part of the Phantom Army now, too. Oh, no. I really don't want to have to fight them. The only way to save them is to take down that nine-headed snake. Yeah! Let's go. This castle is like a maze. Which way should we go? Just be sure to keep an eye out for the nine-headed snake. Follow me, guys. Though I have not been here long, I do know every corner of the castle. Billy Beakman. At your service. Stay where you are. What's happened to you all? - Run! - They're bewitched! What do we do now? It's a dead end. That's right. We gotcha now. Come on, Bruce. Don't you remember us? GoGo, you can join us, too. I can't. You know I don't like it when things get dirty. I calculate we'll have to do this the hard way. Looks like we're gonna have to fight 'em. We can't do that. Your magical flames will harm them. - We got no choice. - They're mind-controlled. - We can't hurt our friends. - Watch out! Well, well, well. I have you now. And you're all mine. I'm gonna barbecue you, you big rump roast. How dare you! Quiet! If you aren't careful, I'll chop you into firewood. No, you won't. Hiyah! Are you trying to rebel? No, not rebel. Return! Wait. But I thought that... you were bewitched. Well, you thought wrong, didn't you, Crusher? Let's get you back to your old self. Patrick, grab the bull by the horns! Ha-ha! I gotcha. Hey, we could use a little help here. Thanks. Going up. How are you? How do you think I am? Awful. Right. If Jimmy Ginseng hadn't arrived in time, we really would have become your victims. You're ruining everything now. Play your song. Make it stop! I must resist. Yes! You've freed me from the Evil Master's mind-control. Ah, much better. Are you OK? I just need to rest. It's up to you now. Don't worry. We'll take care of everything. - Take care. - Thank you. What do you think we should do next? Well, first, we should ask them where the Evil Master is. No. I think we should rescue the princess first. Mmm. She's right. The poor princess has been locked away in an awful place and needs to be rescued now. Yeah. Can you take us right to her, Crusher the Ox? Yes, of course, I can. It would be an honor. Uh. General, sir. Step aside. Move it! Yes, sir. Sorry, General. - How much further? - Not too far. This place smells worse than Peggy's gas bombs. It's enough to make me wanna cock-a-doodle croak. I can't take any more. Hey, we're all in the same stinky boat for now. Princess Angelica, we're here to rescue you. I have been waiting for all of you to come here. We've been tricked. Crusher the Ox, why'd you sell us out? I wouldn't trick my own rescuers. Ah-hah! I'm the one who fooled you, suckers! - Why you... - Hey. I want to know what you've done with Princess Angelica. I bet you do. You will find her locked away in the cave behind me. However, I will never allow you to pass. Oh, yeah? Well, we'll just have to see about that, won't we? All right. Let's charge him. Snake eyes! - He got him! - All right. Good job, Bunny. Old nine heads isn't so powerful after all! We got this. You lose. The Rebellion of the Seven Wonders ends here. Bring it, ugly. Huh? You regenerated? But that's against the rules! Everyone, together. Unless we attack all nine heads at once, we won't be able to stop it. There's nothing I despise more than filthy traitors. Hah. Hiyah! My hair. How dare you! Bernie. The notes. Yes. I'll use the note. Careful. Step aside. I'm burnin' mad, now. I'm gonna break this snake. Let's do this! No, wait! Stop! There's no stopping me now. Feel the burn! Patrick, run! Or we're all going to be turned to ash. Ah, see that? That's how you do it. I can't believe we finally made it. I'm exhausted. I found this burnt piece of paper. - What is it? - It's from the Fox Elder. She told him to open it, when in desperate danger. So, what does it say? We must sacrifice one for the sake of all. We should honor his sacrifice. Let's go rescue Princess Angelica. This is where the nine-headed snake has been keeping her. - This is terrible. - She's in a trance. - Princess Angelica. - Is she alright? She can't hear us. We have to hurry and save her. Princess Angelica, I'll come over there and save you. No, wait. Stop. You can't. It's not safe. The water is contaminated. It's filled with evil poison. Don't touch it. GoGo Goat, use your whip and pull the princess clear. - OK. - No, that won't be sufficient. I calculate your whip won't stand a chance against those chains. Someone is gonna have to cross the water and undo those chains to free her. - Let me be the one. - Huh? If I'd have taken down that snake when this all started, Bernie Hothead wouldn't have had to finish him by himself. It's the least I could do. Ox, no! I'm the one to blame. When I was bewitched by the Evil Master, I almost destroyed Merryland with my rage. A sword cannot break these chains. Only I have the strength that can do it. Almost there. Your highness. It was too much for him. That poor bovine. He'll be all right. So, how is she doing? The power of the Dragon Ball will protect her. Eventually, she will be fine. But as for Crusher, I cannot say. You gonna be OK, there, buddy? Don't worry about me. I finally did something really good. Don't give up. We'll find a way to cure you. Eventually, I'll be fine. But you need to save Princess Angelica. Wait. I still smell the snake. The snake? Where? I thought he was gone for good. So, what are we gonna do now? We've got to get the princess and get outta here. There's only one way out of this chamber, but it's blocked by the snake. We can't get out. Then why don't we dig a new passage? Huh? Together again. Hello, friends. Manny Mantis. - Nice to see you. - How'd you find us? I am a master of many skills. We'll talk later, but for now, you must follow me. Manny's right. We can talk about all that once we've escaped. But first we must get the princess. Not so fast! I can't hold it much longer. Try! Wait. I'm stuck. You're right. I'm afraid the opening isn't quite big enough. Allow me to... Peggy, go next. Take Ox with you. - I can hold the door. - No, I can hold it. - You get out with Ox. - No. You leave first. Wait. Get out of here. - You first. - You go. No, you first. I can hold back the snake. You two, go! No, Crusher. I've got this. Escape while you still can. Hurry, before it's too late! I'll stay here, but you have to save Merryland. Crusher! You found your courage, Patrick. Now's the time to use it. Go now. Have faith in yourself. Thank you, Crusher. Come on. Is everyone OK? No, it's filthy here. How can it be OK? This place is disgusting. I can't wait to take a bath. No, you don't. Stay back! You thought you could contain me! Never! You will never escape! Did Crusher the Ox make it out OK? Well... What are we gonna do? There's a cave. Let's hide in there. - Yeah! - Come on. Hurry! Shh. Quiet. No! We've been hiding here all night. That nine-headed snake's gotta leave at some point. I can't help it. It's in my nature. Roosters crow at the crack of dawn. I've got you now. All right, ugly. I've had enough. Hey, 18-eyes. I'm gonna give your thousand teeth just one chance to give yourself up, right now, or I'm... What? Let's get Princess Angelica out of here. - A little help, guys! - I need to go help Patrick. Huh? Hey, you don't get to be the only hero. I'll stay, too. Me, too. I suppose that means me, too. But then I really have to shower. You are obviously going to need my expertise. - And I'll stay, too. - Hey, don't leave me out! If you all stay, then who's gonna help the princess escape? No, I'm fine. The sun will be coming out soon. The power of the snake is at its weakest right now. It's the best time to destroy it. - Come on, Manny! Run! - Yes. Hurry faster! The Song of Peace. Look. It's our best chance. Attack! Make it stop! I have faith. I won't give up until the last bear falls. Whoa! Oh. Look at that. Wow. Great Panda Warrior, you have finally arrived. Help us to defeat the nine-headed snake. I'm afraid you're too late, Faith. You'll never have enough power to defeat me. I will, with the power of the Panda Warrior. Together, we are invincible. Who is that great whale? That's Faith. One of the heavenly whales and guardians of Merryland. Wow, she's beautiful. She protects the Dragon Ball of Light. Along with Hope, the other heavenly whale. That infernal Faith has ruined all of my plans. This is not possible. I will destroy you all. It burns! Now! GoGo Goat, fight the wind head. Shadowfeet, fight the water head. Mantis, fight the ice head. Bobby Bunny, fight the fire head. Spinny, fight the electric head. Peggy, fight the poison head. Bruce, fight the spear head. Billy, fight the bewitching head. I'll take the main head. I'm all tangled up! No, you can't! - Formation. - Battle array. Hiyah! Bye-bye! That was terrifying. No more nine-headed snake for me. That's it! I don't want to be the Evil Master anymore. They can have all the peace and harmony they want. I'm outta here. See ya, Merryland. Now that the Evil Master is finally been defeated, Faith and Hope, the two heavenly whales are once again the guardians of peace and protectors of Merryland. This is hope This is love This is where we are one If you call, I will hear I will listen for you Merryland is free once more. The Dragon Ball of Light has been restored and will be forever protected by the heavenly whales. Faith and Hope, guard our peace eternally.
