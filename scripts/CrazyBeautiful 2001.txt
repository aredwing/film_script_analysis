[ Tom sighs ] I'm more than happy|to use my connections... to help someone|get a foot in the door... but I have|absolutely no patience... with individuals who will not|participate in the process. I can't do this alone. Mr. Oakley, um... I really appreciate|you seeing me today. OK. I think I know|what's going on here. I know the powerful effect|Nicole can have on people. She's absolutely fabulous... at taking|a perfectly-oiled train... and running it|right off the tracks. Now, I do love her.|Unconditionally. That goes without saying. But she can be so destructive. And volatile. And, um, the anger... ever since... Well, to be 12 years old... and to find your mother|like that... I think when Nicole's mother|took her own life... Nicole decided|then and there... that she would never,|ever trust anyone again. And it was her|against the world... and God forbid anybody|should try and help her. She's persona non grata... with half the psychiatrists|on the Westside. A lot of them have recommended|that I send her to... one of those behavior|modification schools... but I... She's tried to kill herself|a number of times... but what can I do? She lies and she drinks. She does drugs. She hates me.|Hates her step-mother. Mr. Oakley-- [ Sighs ] Ahh, nothing. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be|telling you about this... but you seem like|such a good person. Such a decent person. Now, you want me to write|this recommendation? You want me to put myself|on the line? Well, I want you to|listen to my advice. Now, stay away|from my daughter. You hear me? For your own good,|for my peace of mind... stay away from Nicole. You know, it's a painful|thing for a father to... have to acknowledge a truth|about their own child. It's taken me a long time|to accept who she is. And who she's never gonna be. MAN SINGING:|Well, I could sleep forever But it's of her I dream If I could sleep forever I could forget about everything We got a party, man.|Hey, Carlos... all them honeys|gonna be there, man.

All right. - What happened?|- No, nothing. He just said he'd write me|a recommendation. But what did he say? About what? - About me.|- Nothing. Come on, just tell me|what he said. I really don't want|to get in the middle-- In the middle of what? Look, I just need|to focus right now. You need to focus? I can't afford to mess up, man.|I told you that. My mom's all over me|'cause I'm never around... and my grades are for shit. I could hardly keep|my eyes open at practice. All I want to do is sleep for|more than four hours straight. I'm sorry|for messing up your life. I just need to remember|what's important. What's important to you? My priorities. [ Bell rings ] What did he tell you? [ Sighs ] He told me|to stay away from you. That you were trouble|and you'd just mess me up. And what did you say? I just... I see. MAN SINGING:|Every time It's time to call [ Sobbing ] In many ways Every dream Gets broken over With little time I will fly within your sky Every time You start to call And on the way All destruction is my wine Though it's sad and lonely There's a whole life|waiting after dawn Gonna slide NICOLE: You can be anywhere|when your life begins.
