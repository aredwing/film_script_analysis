The case against Mr. Komarov has caused widespread division amongst the Russian public. Some of whom view his incarceration as a political maneuver, orchestrated by this man, Defense Minister candidate, Viktor Chagarin. What do you want, Viktor? Why are you doing this? What do you want to accomplish tomorrow? I'm prepared to pay for my sins. You should prepare yourself too. Yuri, let's be civil about this. We were friends once... we could be again. Just give me the file... and I'll hand your life back to you. Forget this stupid trial. I don't want my life back. You think I'm going to... let you talk tomorrow? No one is going to hear you! I own everybody in that courtroom. You don't own me. Mike! Chagarin's making a move on Komarov. - Shit! - See who we got local. We are ready to get started. Make the call. You won't disappoint me? Have I ever disappointed you? Anton. Alik, it's Viktor. Yuri Komarov says hello... It's time to grab him. Yuri Komarov? and GOODBYE. =@= [Sub topian] for sub scene.com =@= McClane. - Hey, Murph. How ya doin'? - Nice grouping, grandpa. I can't hit the back one. Is that it? Yep, we found him. It's not good, John. Hospital or morgue? Worse. What was the last time you spoke to this kid? It's been a while. Maybe a few years even. Last time I saw him... pretty ugly. Well, there's a few different versions in there, but, uh... my people are pretty sure he's being held at a Moscow prison... awaiting sentencing. - What's he charged with? - It's a nasty sheet. He'll be lucky to get life. He could never get out of his own way. He had a lot of problems. But he's still my kid. I know. But it's Russia, they do things differently over there. Me too. - Good luck, papi. - Thanks, kid. Welcome to John F. Kennedy... Dad, I wish you'd let me go with you. You'd never be able to resist the urge to tell me what to do all the time. - This isn't your fault, you know? - Just... hope that he figure his life out. I got you something. Idiot's Travel Guide. Perfect. - Thank you, baby. - I love you. I love you too. See you soon. Dad... just try... Try not to make an even bigger mess of things. - Good luck. - I love you. See you soon. I was told you had something to offer me? You're looking for evidence against Yuri Komarov? Perhaps. Put me in the courtroom with him... and I'll testify that Komarov hired me to murder Anton. - Did he? - I'll testify under oath. That's good enough, isn't it? - You speak Russian? - How'd I do? Well, you asked for a large bag of hair, on the way to Taganskaya Courthouse... - but I got it, I got it. - Good, good. - Traffic sucks here too. - Sex? - You want sex? Sexy clubs? - No, no. No sex.

The last person I wanna see. Well, maybe you missed the whole part back there where I saved you and Papa Geppetto here from the whole buncha Russian bad guys! - You s-saved... You saved? - That's right, saved. - Are you Americans? - Shut up. Shut up! You know, you're a world-class screw-up. You know that, John? I'm a screw-up? I'm a screw-up? I'm still your father. Yeah, nothing I can do about that. What a joke. Just shut up! Try not to touch anything, all right? You've done enough Goddamn damage. The appointment is next week. We will begin immediately. Excuse me, sir. Komarov has escaped. I'll call you back. There is a problem with Komarov. What happened? Some sort of attack on the courthouse. - Who took him? - They don't know yet. - What do you mean you don't know? - Eh, well, it's confusing... Eyewitnesses say they saw Komarov... with an American. What American? John McClane. Let's go. After you. Yeah, I got him. Yeah, I'm on it. Look, Mike, we had an unexpected delay today. I'm sorry. I understand. All right, this is the last guy on earth I expected to see. Listen to me, you already have half in Moscow looking for you, okay? - I need you to get dressed, please. - Why am I here? Just please put on these clothes. Trust me. This is the key to your cuffs. Take these. Oh, my Jesus. - We okay? - What? Do you have the file on Chagarin? This is what you've been doing, Jack? Spy shit? This is it? You're a spy? Oh, my God. Very nice. - McClane, shut up! - Take it easy, Oddjob. I'm on vacation. Your mom will be pleased. We thought you were doing drugs or something. Mr. Komarov... Or selling drugs. Yeah, but that was me, really. Do you have the file on Chagarin? Yes or no? It's very simple. You give me the file and I get you out of Russia. And you're a free man. What do you say? It's not about me. I don't care about my life. - Well, that's the deal. - It's the only deal. Come on. Come on, Yuri, help yourself. What's it gonna be? Yes or no? The clock is ticking, Yuri. Come on. You will get me out of here? Only the three of you? Whoa, whoa! Leginski, I'm not in the gang. I just got off the plane! I'm still jet lagged! I'm not involved in this, huh, Jack? Only if I can take my daughter with me. Chagarin's people will kill her. Fine, make it quick. Uh-uh, where's the file? It's in a vault in Pripyat. The key is here in Moscow, at Hotel Ukraina. Shit. Make your call. We're going to the Ukraina. Let's go. It's papa... Father, where are you? What are you doing? I'm fine, Sunshine, we'll talk later. Listen. I'll be waiting for you where your mother and I shared our first dance. - Now. - Yes. Hurry! Hurry! You understand? Mike, listen, sorry about this morning, man. It's fine. Okay, let's go. Beam us up, Scotty! Down! Get down! Go! Get down! Go, go, go! - Get down! - Come on! Do it! John, cover us! Come on, let's do this! Move! Move! All right, jerk-off! - Fine, let's move, John! - I'm on fucking vacation! Come on, time to hustle. Watch your head. Go. - McClane, move it! - 3,000 and my hump for this? Stay down, Yuri! Stay low! That's it. Come on, go, go! Safe house, my ass. - He knows how old we are, no? - Come on. Here, here, here... Sit down. All right... Let me look at you. - It's all right, you're fine. - What are you doing? - Jack! - Just calm down. You're gonna get through this. It'll be just fine. Put this on, put this on. Stay warm. What was that, John, five minutes? Five minutes, you blew a three-year op. - You're welcome! - Five minutes! You're welcome! What do you want me to do? Unbelievable, unbelievable. I'm so fucking burned. I got no friends in this town any more. What about your people at Langley? Just give them a call. Give me your phone. There's a two-year contract to that phone. Give me your gun. Give me that. - All right, you got any cash on you? - Just American money. What are you talking about? We need to keep on moving. You gotta get this guy to a doctor, - to-to medical attention, Jack. - The mission stands. Your mission is bleeding out over there. The mission continues. We go to the hotel. Come on, let's move. Let's fucking go. Aw, this is nuts. What, are you gonna go out and kill somebody else now? - Why all this trouble for just one guy? - He's a political prisoner. Look, not that you care, John, but it's a matter of national security, alright? He's got the goods to stop Viktor Chagarin and we need that to happen. Well, great, Jack, let's drop him off at the embassy, and we can go home. Are you kidding me? After what happened at the safe house? Look, it doesn't work like that, all right? It's a huge diplomatic mess and I'm a burnable asset, so... I now need that file to unfuck this mission. Any more questions? Yeah, just one. How come you never call and told me where you were? When'd you give a shit? All right, Hold up, hold up. Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right? We're almost done, all right? As soon as we get that key, we're gonna grab the file, which means we're already out of Russia. All right? All right. All right, listen to me, you're doing good, all right? I need you to hang here a second. Keep an eye on him, John. Ey, what is it with all this "John" shit? What ever happened to "Dad"? Good question. In Russia, we have word for men like him... "Krutoi." That means "tough, hard." In America, it means "juvenile delinquent." Is he your only child? No, I've got a daughter too. You? I have only my "sunshine." When she was little, I was working all the time. I believed work was all that mattered. I screwed my kid's life up too. Worked all the time, round the clock most of the time when you're a cop. I just thought that working all the time was a-a good thing, you know? It didn't help him at all. It's never too late. I hope. - Okay, let's go. - Come on. All right, Yuri, which part of the building is the ballroom at? - Main tower. - Main tower, which floor? - Top floor. - Top floor. How about security? You remember any guards, cameras, anything like that? - I don't know. - Well, I-I-I need you to remember. I was in prison for 5 years. How should I know? Everything could have changed. I know. Just think, all right? Picture it in your head. Ballroom was closed in '89. I think it's under construction now. So that floor is unsecured. I don't know! Listen, my daughter is in there! I'm scared to death! Let's go! Just calm down, Yuri. I guess you have done that before. Smart. I coulda done it. Irina. Irina. Irina. Papa. Papa. Yeah, that's tentative. Really? I wouldn't know. It's all right. Need a hug? - We're not really a hugging family. - That's right. We just have to get one thing... and then we're leaving Moscow for good. - OK? - OK. Who are they? The young one works for CIA. The old one is his father. Americans. Then thank God for them. - There's something no good about this. - Just shut up, all right? I'm telling you, Jack. It smells bad. Just stop, okay? I know this might seem like a totally foreign concept, you know? Where you love to just run in, making shit up. But like any professional, I have a plan, so let's just stick to it, okay? It's moving by along. All right, Yuri, come on. Let's grab the key, get out of here. Yes. Just take a moment. How're you doing? Fine. How'd you get over here so quick? I took Garden Ring. Oh, the Garden Ring. It's supposed to always be bad, right? - Hey, John. - So were you stuck in traffic? I have it, I have it. Welcome, Americans! Put your Goddamn guns down, asshole! Papa, what is going on? - Hmm... give me your weapons. - Come and get 'em. Really? Really. - Sunshine. - Papa. - Yuri! - Do it! I thought you were a problem child. Is this part of your plan, Mr. "Professional"? What are you doing? It's about money, papa. Millions of dollars. You think life was easy for me? While you were sitting in prison being a victim. But I'm your father. And I am your daughter. - We should kill the old man now. - We still need him. - But them, you can kill. - Thank you. Hi. I don't know if I'm saying this right... "Hi." Do you know what I hate about the Americans? Everything. Especially cowboys. Could have been a dancer, I swear to God. But nobody support me. You two... have been such a... PAIN... in the... ASS! Come on, come on! I prefer dancing, really. But killing is much, much better than working in a grocery... Fuck! Jesus Christ! You guys... so arrogant. It's not 1986, you know? Reagan is dead. Oh, God! - What's funny there? - Can't tell ya. It's not you. I love these outfits. You guys are looking good. Yeah, yeah... yeah. There was nothing. Let's dance. Come on, come on! Watch out for detour! Jack! Do you remember the last time we talked just before you went away? Oh, no. No, no, no! You're not gonna open up to me right before we die! - 'Cause that's not your thing, John! - What's my thing? Fucking killing bad guys! That's your thing! You're not gonna die today! Go! Lift off! Shit! I'm fucked now. We're finished, John. I can't believe this. I can't believe this. Unbelievable. - Jack... Hey! - Shit! Jesus! Come on! Kid, don't even slow down! Where are they? Come on! Alik, that's it. We're done! - Let's go! Break left! - Copy, Commander. - Do you have him? - Yes. And the file? Does he have it? I need that file, Alik. - He's taking us there. - Right. No more mistakes, Alik. And when you have the file, kill them both. Yes, sir. Shit! - Yeah, that was exciting. - Yeah, loads of fun. You wanna go again? - Were you shot? - No. No, I'm fine. - Let me take a look at it. - No, it's fine. Oh, fuck, I can't believe she betrayed her father for Chagarin. I don't understand that. Someday you will. Kids. What's our next move? I don't know. - You don't know? - I don't know, all right? I... I mean, I'm out of moves. I don't know. I-I don't know. I screwed up. I blew the mission. - Well, then we're done, right? - Yeah, we're done. We're done. We should just go home. We'll stop by a little pharmacy on the way out of Moscow, get you some merthiolate or mercury and fix up your little scratches here, get you home... a little toy set. Make yourself a nice warm glass of milk with a little Bosco in it. - Your CIA slippers... - All right! - What? - I get it. - What the hell are we gonna do? - What's in the file? Evidence on Chagarin. Evidence about what? Chernobyl. Look, listen to me. Komarov and Chagarin used to have this nasty little... side racket going on back in the day. They siphoned weapons-grade uranium, got greedy, caused a meltdown. And, uh, you know, they fell out. Former partners, bad breakup. Scumbags. So, Chagarin had Komarov thrown in jail. You know, put him in the hole, forget about him. He doesn't have to worry any more. - So, what happened to "Russki Wusski"? - Well, he grew a conscience. - Yeah, well, that figures. - Listen, Chagarin is bad news. Now, here's the real deal... You see, this guy in control. We're gonna see the whole thing fall apart. I'm talking... terrorism, WMDs... nukes. Someone's gotta stop him. Well... that's what we do. We go out to P"j"ypia"p", and... do our thing. - Our thing? - Yeah. Go out there and kill all the scumbags. - What? You got something better to do? - All right, pull it. - You're not gonna cry, are ya? - Just pull it. Everybody needs a good cry once in a while, Jack. Don't be ashamed. - Pull it. - You remember that time when you and Ralphie Mauser were gonna have that house painting job? Got your finger caught in the ladder, you cried for about five, six days? - John, just pull it! - All right, come on, come on. On three. Here you go. One... two... - Good God. - Jesus! What's the last time you had a tetanus shot? - You all right? - Yeah. - We need a car. - Attaboy. Back to work. Hey, "Watergate", how's that lock coming? - Almost there. - Here, try these. Oh, stealing, that's nice. Yeah, real nice, John. Yeah, I'm up for the "Father of the Year" award. All right. How'd you know all of these guns were gonna be here? It's a, uh, Chechen hangout. Owner doesn't like guns in the club, so these bozos leave them in their cars. - Learned a lot in three years. - Yeah. So, are we really going to Chernobyl? Yeah. THE Chernobyl, where the radioactive joint meltdown? That's the one. It's not the "Chernobyl" in Switzerland, right? With all that... the skiing, and the snow and everything. You mean "Grenoble"? No, sorry, we're not going to Grenoble. Eddie Collins' kid took him on vacation last year. They went down to Boca. - Oh, yeah? - Spent four days at the track. Aw, that's nice. - Audrey likes it. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. - I get to go to Chernobyl? - Yeah, sorry about that. Put all the radioactive stubs out, right? - Is it as you remember, papa? - I don't want to remember. Tough. The file is in the inner vault. Very touching. Let's move. - Which one is it? - Get moving, old goat. A couple of fresh coats of paint and a weed-whacker and it's good to go. You know, at first, they denied anything even happened? Held a children's parade the next day to prove it. Never came back. As soon as they get in that vault, Komarov's a dead man. All right. You got a plan? Not really. I thought we'd just... wing it, you know. Running in guns blazing, making shit up as we go. - Yeah? - Yeah. What is this, a pirate gun? Yeah, go old school, man. Like you, right? Yeah, like me. One of these days, we're gonna have a long talk. Look, Jack, sorry your partner got killed. Sorry I fucked up your day. Wasn't my plan. I mean... that I caused you problems. You know, I came here for something else. Hey, you know what? I'm not gonna bullshit, I mean... I had a pretty good day. It's fun... running around with ya. It's good to see ya. I love you, boy. Me too. I want you to know, I got your back. I got yours too. All right. Let's go kill some motherfuckers. Key. Okay, what the fuck is this? I'm losing my patience. The fucking file better be here. Radiation has been pooling in this room for decades. You underestimated us, daddy dearest. Bring it in! Attaboy. Come on! Come on! Compound 274. It neutralizes radiation. Trust me. Well, what's this remind you of? Newark. All clear. We can ditch these suits. What the hell is that? What? Don't worry, it's stable in this form. The file. Irina, cut the crap, please. No one here is speaking about uranium. Where is the file? No more games. Where is the file? That's no longer your concern. Sunshine, you did well. I told you... everything would work out. Come to papa. - Pap, You're a genius. - I know. Load it up. Pegasus? Do you copy? A lot of hardware for a file. Wheels up in five minutes. Perfect. Here you go, sir. Team extraction completed. She's all yours. Good. - Are you inside? - Yes, yes, Viktor. I'm inside. - Yuri? - You surprised? I'm in the same place where it all started... before you betrayed me. Remember... you promised to give me my life back. You gave it back to me. I thank you for that. And now... ...I'm going to take yours. Static 4, we are ready for take off. Static 4, do you copy? Yuri! Yuri. I wanna see "Dancer." - You okay? You hurt? - No. I'm-I'm good. I'm all right. What's in these boxes? Thank God you're here, Jack. We have to leave. They're coming back any minute. - Just-just let me get the file. - What's in the boxes? It's U-235. Weapons-grade uranium. Armored cases. Bomb kind? Yeah, the bomb kind. - Not so fast, Eddie. - Are you crazy? - Yes, a li'l bit. - I'm getting the file. No. No, you're not. Your key... This is your vault, isn't it, Yuri? What? No... No, I... You put this shit in here, right? - What? No. - Right? I didn't know, Jack. - Is that the dancer down there? - What are you talking about? Had a tough break for a grassling. Jack, you know me... Yeah, I know you. I know. I know him better. There never was a file, was there, Yuri? Of course there was no file. It was simply... bait. What I needed was in this vault. Chagarin was the only one with enough power and influence to get me out of jail. I used him. I used you. - It's about money. - When's it not about money? You want to arrest me? You're out of your jurisdiction, Detective McClane. Aren't you? I wouldn't worry too much about being arrested. You see, my boy... CIA... No phone call... Spy shit. Goddamn Americans. You think you're so smart. No, I'm not that smart. I'm just on vacation. But my boy here... he gonna put a whuppin' on you. Move! Hope you said goodbye to your daughter, you Pavlovian fuck. Where's your little "sochiniso"? Shit! I'll be on the roof. The roof. Jack! - Welcome aboard. - All systems go? - Within normal parameters. - Lift-off. Subtle! What the hell's in those Goddamn grenades? Go get him! I'm going for the helicopter! - Vadim, watch the tail. - Copy. You are at 120 meters... There is small arms fire coming from the roof. There. Watch the tail for me there. - Come on! Come on, hurry! - Vadim, give me firing control now... Engaging! Jack! - Shoot him! - With pleasure, papa. I'm on fucking vacation! Vadim! He is there! I see him! The shit we do for our kids. Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker. CG's shifted... I've got full forward cyclic. I am losing control. Jesus Christ! Well done! Mr. "Super Spy." What a shame your father won't be alive to see you promoted. Neither will you. Hey! Jack! Hang on, John! John! Come on! - We're out of ammunition! - Shit. Bastards. What the hell are you doing? This is for you, papa. @ || ((||)) John! John! John! John! Dad! Right here. Did you just call me "dad"? No. - I didn't think so. - You're hearing things. You got swimmer's ear. So, we aren't gonna grow any third arms or anything, are we? Nah. - You might lose your hair. - Huh! Laugh it up, kid. - That's just you five years from now. - It's rainwater. We'll be fine. Besides... It's hard to kill a McClane. - Now you're a McClane? - Yeah, I'm a McClane. John McClane. - John McClane, Junior. - Well, that makes you a "senior." That's right. Try not to forget it. I'm your father. Have some respect for your father. Let me ask you something... Do you go looking for trouble or does it always just seem to... find you? You know, after all these years... I still ask myself the same question.
