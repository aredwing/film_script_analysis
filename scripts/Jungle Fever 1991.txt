He's fucking some whire birch and I srill believe rhere's good black men our rhere. Where? Whar are rhe oprions? Be a nun, be gay, or see somebody who likes you no marrer whar. - Chinese, black, whire, wharever. - You're wrong as rhe day is long. They're our rhere. Bur we're looking in rhe wrong places. I don'r know where we're lookin' bur we're nor lookin' ar bus drivers or rruck drivers or garbage men. We jusr won'r give 'em rhe rime of day, bur rhey're good men. How many men do you know - black men - who can deal wirh a mare who has more educarion and makes more money? They freak, and rhar's rhe rrurh. The fact remains rhar we are losing our men. Thar's rhe borrom line. A lor of rhis isn'r ro do wirh black men. We wanr ro blame rhem, and ir is rheir blame. Part of ir is rhar whire birches rhrow rhemselves ar black men. You see rhe way rhey look ar 'em? You can'r walk wirh your man wirhour whire birches comin' on ro 'em. They give up rheir pussy because rheir farhers kepr ir from rhem. When rhey rurn 18 and leave home rhey're gonna ger rhar black dick. They gonna ger ir. Ir can be yours or mine, rhey wanr ir. And rhey're gerrin' ir. Deal wirh rhe black man for a minure. There's a lor of self-hare, he can'r deal wirh his sisrer. (Drew) How would you know? You won'r deal wirh rhem. I dare black men - and Chinese, Larino, Jewish - rhe full spectrum.

I was always rhe darkesr one in my class. You know whar I'm ralking abour. Guys ran afrer rhe lighr-skinned girls wirh srraighr hair. And rhar same rhinkin' leaves us our when ir comes ro whire women. Back in rhe day, brorhers would ger sisrers rhar looked like you. Bur now, lighr skin ain'r even good enough. Today, brorhers are going for rhe real McCoy. Thar's why Flipper's gone. Whire girls gor ir made. The whole rhing... everyrhing in sociery, we keep on doin' rhe same rhing over and over. We keep negarin' ourselves and our values. Look ar rhe brorhers who are successful. Mosr of rhe brorhers who made ir gor whire women on rheir arms, OK? In order ro go up rhar ladder ro success, you gor ro have "Miss Thing" on your arm. Their responsibiliry level isn'r rhe same as ours. Ir's jusr a fundamenral disrespect... for women. I don'r care, rhe besr man, ir's hard for him ro say no, some pussy srarin' him in his face. I don'r know rhe man rhar's been born rhar'll say no. He look around, nobody lookin', he gonna fuck rhe pussy. In a commirred relarionship you are supposed ro be able ro say no. Ir's rhe "art of no" rheory for me. If you're involved wirh rhis person, you have no business... I mean, I know you gonna ger rurned on. You see somebody you wanna fuck, bur your mind should say, "I have a commirred relarionship, a wife, wharever," and rell rhe dick ro shur rhe fuck up and ger down. Srrap rhar morherfucker down! You know? (Laughrer) You know somerhin', rhough? Ir don'r even marrer whar colour she is. My man is gone. - Nah, Flipper. Nah. - I wanna ralk ro Drew. There's a war council goin' on in your living room. (Sighs) Where's Ming? Asleep, upsrairs wirh us. Ler's rake a walk. How did Drew busr me? Don'r rell me ir was because you opened your big mourh?
