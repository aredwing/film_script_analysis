I still remember that winter of my childhood. The harshest we had seen in a while. It was as though the valley was shrouded in the sheet of death. Let me go. Leave me. Name? Your name? Noor. Noor what? Nizami. Noor Nizami. Look, I haven't had a drop of vvater since the past two days. I want to eat something right now. If not, I swear I will tear you apart. And, don't even think of running.  find you and tear you to pieces. We were a group of five. Three were killed by the army on the border. One of us had turned traitor. I dug out that bastard from hell. And gouged his eye out. Now his one eye will haunt him for the rest of his life. ls there a place where I can spend the night? - Warning! The army has you surrounded. - We don't want any loss to life. - Give up your arms. Surrender! - Check over there. - We are warning you again. - Give up your arms. - Surrender! - Or you'll be killed. Give me the tool bo. Noora. So we are catching a cold now, are we? Where were you last night? I fell asleep waiting for you. I had sent him... to get the tools from the tool shed. I was stuck in the snow, sister. You two have worked hard enough to create the Taj Ivlahal! Are the designs for the embroidery ready? Why dont you show them? You both can do as you please. I request you to please come home early. Eid preparations haven't even begun yet. Go carefully, dear. The situation in the city is not safe. Why do you do this? You know she gets worried. Hovv long will I cover for you? These are beautiful, Noor! Have you made this? Why didn't you show them to her? This time I want a hefty Eid gift. Don't be miserly. In cross firing with the army three millitants were killed. Millitant commander Ivluazzam Bhatt is still at large. The situation has worsened after the flag was hoisted on Lal Chovvk. The army is on high alert. There is patrolling everywhere. The Begum has called me to the mansion to repair the roof. Thank God. If the Begum is generous, we'll make it through this winter. Our houseboat is hardly running this year. Take this mister, too. Let him know what its like to work for a living. Thafll get him in shape. The Begum came from a princely family. Pretty as an angel. Her mother was from Lucknow. There was a rumour many years ago that spread like wild fire. Someone cast an evil eye on that family. The Begum is a strict one. She will not stand any misbehavior. Concentrate on your work. Keep an apology and a greeting always handy. If anyone asks, present it immediately. The city folk say that the mansion is haunted. Noora, be careful of the ghosts. Junaid, tea? Stop staring. Firdaus, mother is waiting. F-I-R-D-A-U-S Firdaus. Listen. Mother has called you inside. V\/e be there in two minutes. Not you. You may rest. Only him. I\/Iy sling? What? Sling. Forget about it. Don't even think of telling anyone. Thafll be in your best interest. You are so beautiful. Hovv did you learn to speak so sweetly? Don't let your eyes wander and your words will automatically become sweet too. What did you say his name is? Noor. Master Hoor, what do you do? What can you do? Not Hoor, it is Noor. What do I need to do? Damn, it always stops here. Sing me something. Something that will touch my soul. I haven't cried since a very long time. Kashmiri Folk Song Excellent, Firdaus. Where did you find him? Sir Noor Khan, arent you a little gem? What else can you do? Can you ride a horse? What? Do you at least know hovv to tend to the horses? Mother, take a look at his shoes. So from tomorrow, you will look after our stables. If you work diligently, you will be rewarded well. And don't think that I'm offering you a job because I'm impressed with your singing. Firdaus liked your shoes. And I cannot say no to her. Firdaus will have someone to play with. But you don't play loose with your heart. This is the age for you to have fun. Save all your heartbreaks for later. Take a token from Kaleem on your way out. You are now going to be a part of this legacy. Your honour is ours. Wear something decent from tomorrow. There is a world beyond shoes, sir.  take your leave then. Who knew that God had His grace on this one? Novv, he finally be of some use. You must do everything to keep them happy. Are you listening? Don't do anything silly this time. Begum can change your life if she wishes to. With the soft threads of Pashmina Someone spins her dreams Hovv so? The abundant hills echo New songs, these instruments Hovv so? With the soft threads of Pashmina The blossoms have just altered Their moods, feelings Hovv so? The eyes have revealed New secrets, emotions Hovv so? With the soft threads of Pashmina Someone spins her dreams Hovv so? It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness. It was the season of light, it was the season of darkness. It was the... Delicate breeze blends with the young smoke The youthful heart seeks new moments Tepid sunshine slips on the untrodden paths Somebody surreptitiously whispers I will be your shadow Walk behind you Walk on with you With the soft threads of Pashmina Someone spins her dreams Hovv so? The abundant hills echo New songs, these instruments The Narangs are offering a cut above the market price. They want to turn this mansion into a heritage hotel. Tell me one thing, Zafar. Has your father not left you with anything? You come here salivating every year. Now please do me a favour and get your sorry face out of here. Sell it, sister. The market situation is bleak. Jagirdar, show them out. The old woman has lost her head. She has wasted more than half her fortune on jewelry. She should be sent to Tussauds. They will take her as is. Calm down, Sameera. There is jack shit we can do. 14th October. 3:10 pm. Remember the day and time. I made you my friend today. It's my birthday net week. You have to come. Don't forget. Stop staring, Noor. It's bad manners. Did he like it? Yes, mother. I saw him. He cou dnt let go of it. I have invited him on Sunday. Dear, at this rate the world will come to an end and you still won't know what to wear. And anyway, if Rukhsar figures out, who knows what she will do to us. You are really scared of her, arent you? You can't hurry these things. It's Firdaus birthday. Not your regular local fair. Sure, I'm looking good? Yes, like a prince. Noor! There now, sister has seen my outfit too. Prayer for the departed. Firdaus! Firdaus! You've come now? The birthday was yesterday. Firdaus will now wait for you on her net birthday. Where is Firdaus? Firdaus. If there is a heaven on earth, it is here. It is here. These are cruel times. Everyone wants a piece of this heaven. ve sent Firdaus to school in London. This is no place for her to grow up in. Bombs go off anywhere. She was choking here. Now you catch your breath too. Don't believe what your eyes see. Listen to your heart, Noor. But now it isn't yours anymore. You have given it away. I told you not to. It broke, didn't it? Love is not simple, Noor. You will either sink or swim. You have to become someone to be deserving of Firdaus. It's not so easy to enter her world. You will have to give it your all. You are no longer a child. Stop crying and go home. The situation here is getting from bad to worse. Stay alive, Noor. You are no use, dead. Neither to Firdaus, nor to me. And just like that, everything came to an end. Begums words kept swirling around in my head. As though a chasm opened up inside of me and I kept falling, deep down. A deep black chasm. So dark that even my screams were dying inside. Days turned to months and months to years. I couldn't get her out of my heart. But I could at least look for her in every living spark, in every dying ember. She, who was not anywhere. She, who was everywhere. Finish the rest tomorrow. Let's go get dinner. I will sleep in the shed tonight. Jiju? I told Junaid so many times. I even sent the art books with Kaleem. You didn't even come to meet me once. I got busy with work in the shop. So much pain. Hovv do you bring so much pain in your art? I recognized you the minute I laid eyes on you. ve pared a lot ofjewels in my time. Today is an auspicious day. I would like the good fortune of being your first patron. It is your first earning. Savour it. Your new life starts from today. God bless you. Any news of Firdaus, Begum? You may want to ask on me too, sometime. Firdaus is in Delhi. She was asking about you. Good thing we met. Now theres lots to tell her. Nooruddin Nizami. Age - 23 years. There is good news. He has been chosen for an Arts Scholarship. Art for Freedom. They are promoting young artists. In short, his life is about to change. There is a small clause. He will have to go to Delhi and join a residency program. He'll get an allowance every month. All expenses like food and stay will be borne by my client. Your client? ls it the Begum? Clause 5. I do not have the liberty to disclose the name. My client wants his training to start as soon as possible. Why me? Why was I chosen? Think of it as God's grace. What we know as Lady Luck or Kismet. See you in Delhi, then. But Jun-jiju, I cant just leave you. There is nothing left here, child. You just rot sitting here. The one above is paving the way for you. Don't fight Him anymore. If there is heaven on earth It is here, it is here My life, my soul, my heart are committed It is here, it is here Jun-jijus prayers worked for me. Whether it was God's mercy or Begums largesse. But d found my purpose. As though the world was calling out to me. It was extending its arms. Go, embrace it. I have spoken to the landlord. He already has one year's rent in advance. Your residency starts tomorrow. Leena Becker, who is a renowned curator, will be in charge of you. She will explain the rest. Alright? Yes. Good morning! Sorry for all the noise last night. Some breakfast? Noor, right? Arif Peerbhoy. Come, join us. Jagirdar had said you would be coming. Please have a seat. So, artist, huh? I dabble a bit in it myself. I have a small collection. Mostly new guys. What are you working on currently? I am still searching. FOr? Myself. Not bad. So, full on exploration happening, huh? You are from Kashmir, isn't it? Begum Hazrat Jaan is my aunt. Tell me, what is the equation between you and the Begum? She is a piece of work. Be careful of her. Anyway, the room on top is also mine. You can work here in peace. It's an open house. Feel free. I'm going to cancel my yoga today. I can't do it. Just can't. So do you come to Kashmir often? Who will go to that haunted house? Shes cut off all links with family. Tell me something, hovv can someone live so alone? It is not so simple to understand her. I have seen her heart. She does quite a lot for others. You mean for you? I am just messing with you. So, what is the plan for today? I have a meeting with Leena Becker. LBG Gallery. Not bad. Home-run right on arrival. Have you settled in? - Yes. Did you like the studio? - Yes.

Keep him behind you. Everything ahead has been decided. As for the rest, you are smart enough. I wouldn't have recognized you if I saw you like this the first time. Don't!

Your time is here. Goodbye, Noor! We will meet again... if life permits. Hello. Noor. .. my dear! Imagine, I had to hear from Jagirdar that you have come to Srinagar. When are you coming home?

Greetings. I thought as much. Got homesick so soon in the city? I was on my way home. Thought I'd drop in to see you. Oh, so His Highness has come to see the Begum. Did you meet Firdaus? What did you think of her? Isn't she precious? Noor's little princess. You've come to meet her, haven't you? Call out to her. Call her. Call her. Firdaus! Firdaus! Careful, Noor. Bilal is coming. ts her own choice. What could ve done? Hi, Noor. Hovv are you? When did you get here? I'll catch up with you in a while. Come on mother. It's peak afternoon.

One moment you blow hot, the other, cold. What's your problem, Noor? Why have you come after me? What have you come to see? Did I tell you to follow me for the rest of your life? You are just too much! Mother, you need to stop smoking that damn hookah. Hovv will the medicines work? These merciless medicines don't let me die easily. Maybe opium will help. Noor, what will you do now? Are you going home? If you are, do me a favor. I owe Junaid some money from last winter. Some two thousand three hundred. Take it from Kaleem on your way out. Move. - Yes. Begum clenched her fist and it was almost as if time stopped. What was I being punished for? Who had snuffed out all love from this house? Whose story were we reliving? This smell of yours will drive me crazy. Enough! You jin us now. Now hurry up and show some of your magic or somebody will steal this fragrance away. Look at this emerald. It'll look so lovely on you. Lord, hovv beautiful! Salman, hovv long are you here for? Father wanted to stay, but he had to leave for the elections. I leave for London on Sunday and from there to Islamabad. I would like to take Hazrat to London for the trousseau shopping. Why don't you ask her yourself? Hazrat is too much of a free bird. Hovv long will we keep meeting this way, Mufti? Who all will we lie to? I'm constantly worried about getting caught. Things are tough, I know. But we cant give up hope. Nobody can stop us from getting married, Hazrat. - Hazrat will understand and appreciate our choices. - Besides, she'll not be far away. - We'll get her married, but hovv will you manage without her? - Salman will care for her like a princess. - We shouldn't delay the marriage ceremony any more. Mufti! Mufti! Take care of this. Ticket. I'll get water. You wait here. Ecuse me, my wife is sitting there... Please watch out for her, I'll just go get some water. Sure. Mufti! Mufti! Hello.

Noor, it's one of Delhi's top art events... Why don't you answer it? Somebody is really desperate out there. It's been growling all day long. Don't talk nonsense. Just help me out. It's stuck. Who got stuck on you now? \/Ir. Minister, do I smell something burning? For sure! Just look at you. You're the prettiest girl in the world tonight. Someone's heart must surely be burning. Thank you, sire. That was such a backhanded compliment. Now shall we get about the rest of the evening? Everyone is waiting. Boundaries can separate countries, but they cant separate our language, customs and traditions. We live in each others hearts. And it's time now to welcome each other in our homes. To embrace each other vvhole-heartedly. We enjoy your food, you enjoy our ghazals. The circle of bonhomie will only prosper. Just one last request.

In fact, we are the ones who must do the hosting. No one can win with you in words, Hazrat. Anyway, we shall settle with your dearest jewel. Our Firdaus is looking like an angel. We should not delay the marriage ceremony any more. Three crores in the center of the room with the gentleman... we have Shahzia Sikandas The World is Yours, The World is Mine at three crores.

Don't you have anything to say to me? I've said what I had to, Noor. I love you. Don't be childish, Noor. You hardly know me. We were destined for just this much. Please let's just be grateful for what we had. ls this like some dole you handed out? I love you, don't you get it? But I don't, Noor. I can't love like this. What do you want? That I leave all this? Come with you on your houseboat? What will happen then? Have you thought about it? Have you thought about anything at all? You are too much, Noor. I'm getting engaged in two days. Bilal will keep me happy. We've been friends for years. We understand each other. And I can't let a stupid mistake ruin this. What about love, Firdaus? Or is money everything? You know no one can love you like I can. I don't want so much madness, Noor. And it's not about money. Marriage is between equals. Families are involved. You won't understand. You won't understand anything besides your love. Why are you lying to yourself, Firdaus? I have to go now. I can't be missing for so long. Please, Firdaus. Why are we standing so far away From each other? In your breath And in mine We breath the same air I Will die Dont leave me so Let there be an expression of love There's love buried deep within the heart The heart beats alone Alone Arif. - Yes? Heart to heart Let there be an expression of love Noor... That's enough. Let's get out of here. No. Not yet. In a bit. Noor, we've spent too much time here. Let's go somewhere else. Hang on. I'll just go meet Firdaus and come. Noor... Let her go. Which part of this don't you understand? It's not that she lied to you. I know... I know... but these people are like this. She is the Begum's daughter after all. They don't care for anyone. They will swallow you whole and you won't even know it. Get out of all this. Don't screw up your career. You've been a good friend.  never forget that. Now go home. Don't give me your advice. You can go shove it. To hell with you, your Leena and my future. Bro, give me a drink. Noor, my dear, what a talented artist you are turning out to be! Noor, what the hell is wrong with you! You are completely out of your... Firdaus! Excuse me... No, sir... don't. Please, sir, stand back. If you ask for milk, we will give you pudding! But if you ask for Kashmir, we will give you a thrashing! If you ask for milk, we will give you pudding! But if you ask for Kashmir, we will give you a thrashing! Such a bright chap... gone! You can't get drunk and create a ruckus at this kind of a high profile event! Take him away! Lock him up for the night. A thrashing will bring him to his senses. You should have kept him in check. Was it necessary to bring it down to this? Whatever happened in the past, I have no interest in digging into it. But your future is mine and mine alone. Isn't it? Isn't it? Nizami! You got bail. Take him with you too. He's been sitting here for two vvhole days. Mad family! Let's go home, Jun-jiju. I did what I had to. Here, drink this. Cool down. I've ruined everything. I had lost my mind. I only thought about myself and this great love of mine! Forgive me, Jun-jiju! Don't cry. Everything will work out. This was my mother's prized possession. I've cared for it like a baby. You need to forget about what happened in Delhi, Firdaus. That story is now over. Now you are going to become someone e se's possession. What will I do being someone e se's possession? Hang around their neck my entire life? Don't be crazy, Firdaus. You don't know what you are saying. I know, I should do what is right. I know... I know it all. I have been hearing all of this since I was a child. But my heart feels otherwise. Something is not right. Tell me mother... what should I do? Don't worry my doll. I was your age once. I had also got swept up in all these emotions. What did I get in return? Do you want to live my life, Firdaus? It's not necessary that what happened with you will happen to me. Yes, of course... It's not necessary at all. Anyway what wrong has ever happened with you? You are a fortunate one. Hovv else would an orphan ever become the pride of this palace? ls it necessary to remind me again and again, mother? Yes, it is, Firdaus. I had thought that God had sent you to me for a special purpose. I protected you from everyone. You were special. You are still special, my doll. You've not been made to waste away in love. This palace now needs a man, a name, a title. And now you are going to bring back that lost splendor. We can't be out on the streets again. Neither you, nor I. Please get dressed soon. Bilal will be here any moment. Congratulations! Be blessed! Praise the Lord, stay happy you both. Aunt Nargis, drop the spoons and dig into it with your hands! You won't become fat. Rascal! Kaleem, please feed him some meatballs. So many years have gone by you still haven't been able to forget her. Dear, the heart moves in mysterious ways. He who hasn't felt that yearning, has not lived at all. It's truly a blessing to be in love! As time passes, it only gets stronger. Pure, beautiful, soulful. I may be cursed like that. That the heart yearns for what once was. Those sweet fragrant days of my past. London's my last chance. Will you come along? I don't have the strength to do this alone. Arif? Should I do push ups for you? Give me 5O right now. Let me show you the gallery and the space for your exhibition. And here is the outdoor space for your exhibition. I hope it's inspiring enough! So 3O meters... we can't go wrong With that. Alright? Just measure it and come back and tell me. Sure. Congratulations... we made it to the London Time Out. This is centre stage! London, isn't it? There is something very interesting about the way he thinks. The way he articulates his expression. What could be macabre for one could be freedom for someone else. Noor, my child... you disappeared again! Now I have to meet you in this foreign city. When Jagirdar told me, I couldn't keep myself from coming. Firdaus sent these flowers for your big day. Oh my God! You were always a good artisan but now you have truly bloomed into an artist! There is depth in your work now. Good show, Noor! Somebody smashed your heart big time! You have poured out everything, you must be all empty now. You must be feeling naked. Noor. .. over here! Begum! Begum... Firdaus didn't come? Firdaus! Firdaus! I came... doesn't that mean anything? Go inside, Noor. This is the biggest day of your life. Forget everything else. Begum! Noor Nizami. .. Artist. Don't vvorry. Jagirdar has sent me. Come, I'll drop you home. No. I want to be alone. We are all alone. Come. Have a drink with me. Come on, sir. Will treat you to London's best Kashmiri tea. Come. Noor Nizami. That runt of a boy who used to ride a boat on the Dal Lake. Look at him today. The rising star of the art world! Have we met before? I swear to God. I will tear you apart. Ivluazzam! Nowadays, I am known by the name of Mirza Baig. What do you want from me? Jagirdar? - Yes. I had sent Jagirdar to you. Your arts scholarship is standing in front of you. IIC Delhi... The Gallery of Modern Art The exhibition at the Aman The Freedom Series All your show-stoppers! I picked up all of them. I doubled your price overnight. Lies! After what happened in Delhi, I had great difficulty convincing the London organizers. Vvhy? I had two sons your age. My jihad ate them up. Neither did I get freedom, nor death. I came here under a different name. Worked night and day. And built all this from scratch. But away from my country I couldn't forget that boy who risked it all to bring me a warm coat. The thought of that coat kept me vvarm many a night. Today when everyone in the gallery were singing your praises I had tears in my eyes! Noor, my boy. We did it! We? This is all about you. Did anyone ever ask me what I wanted? Don't be upset, Noor! At least not today. Today? Today you've reduced me to nothing! Today, I don't even know who I am. Am I even worth anything? Why did you do all this? Who told you to do all this? You can't just play God as you please. Screw your charity! I don't want it... don't want it! No matter hovv hard you run your past does not forget you. It follows you like your shadow. You are now going to be part of this legacy. Your new life starts from today. God bless you! For better or for worse I will always be that boy from the Dal. Little Noora! To be deserving of Firdaus you have to become someone. Presenting... man of the hour Noor Nizami! My whole life was a lie... a conspiracy. Why did you lie to me? Why did you say that if I want to win over Firdaus I need to become someone? Why did you make me feel that you are making me worthy of her? You thought whatever you had to. I never promised you anything. Your thoughts always got ahead of you. IVIy thoughts? And what you did was nothing? All this was a game for you. You laid my heart out and played dice on it. And Firdaus? You should have at least thought about her? Don't you dare take her name. When I saw you for the first time I knew right away. That same attitude that same insolent stare. I knew that you would strike when the opportunity arose. But not this time... not this time, Mufti. I have kept Firdaus heart locked up in my coffer. It's invaluable. People of your ilk can't even glance at her. She is getting married to Bilal. Can you feel it? It's broken. - Yes! And now you take these broken pieces and mend it all your life. Why did you betray me? Where did my love fall short? Now you will know, Mufti hovv it feels when the heart breaks. Hovv a living throbbing life comes to a complete stand still. Now you will know! No, father! No! No, father... my child! My Child Will die! No, father! My child will die. Come! Let her go. Forgive her! Move aside. Please don't do this. She made a mistake. Let her go. She's your daughter! We raised a whore for our daughter! She has stripped me in front of the whole world. Drop that phone! No doctor will come to this house. Let her rot along with her goddamn child! Mother... Your child is a girl. Madam. Firdaus. Noor... Noor! Firdaus. If I'm destined to ruin I accept. If this is hovv it has to end then I accept. I accept! I accept! I accept! Prayer for the departed. Child. It was an accident, dear. Don't curse yourself so much. It will take time but we will try to get through this. Let's complete the rituals and head to Islamabad. Noor had come to meet mother. I need to see him. What? Noor... I want to meet him. Your motherjust passed away. People are saying all sorts of things. And you still haven't come to your senses, Firdaus? Didn't I warn you? No more beyond this... that's it! Didn't I? Don't make the same mistake that your mother made. I am not my father who'll bow down all my life and pine away. It doesn't let go even when you die. Love... Love is a strange beast. You can whip it, starve it, push it deep down in your insides. But you can't pull it out of you. If your heart knows where it belongs you'll fight with the vvhole world to get there. A wise man once said it's truly a blessing to be in love. Let it possess you. Without fear, without shame. Without thought. Love in itself is its own reward. No one wins, no one loses. Noor! Noor! Will you stop staring, Noor?
