I mean baked goods, bread... - Bread and honey. - Right. Honey sweetens more for the same amount of calories. May I come in? Chambermaid. Excuse me... - I'll come back later. - No, come on in. - I'll start in the bathroom. - Okay. You look better with your hair down. That's the only thing that makes a difference. Ifyou smoke and drink coffee, whitening won't work. You drop from a B1 to a B3 in two, three months. I think you're at least an A2. - Bye. - Bye. - First time? - Is it that evident? A bit. Where are you from? Wait... - Budapest? - No. Ljubljana. Where's that? - Hi. - Hi. What are you looking for, Number 10? I don't know, the same as everyone else. A soul mate. Maybe. You? It's cheaper than a social life. Dinner and almost certainly a screw, all for 25 Euros. And the seduction factor is very important to me. I guess so. I'll mark you down as "yes". - Hi. - Hello. I'm Guido. I'm Sonia. - Not going to say anything? - I'm waiting. You haven't put "no" yet for the guy before me. Tough evening? - The worst is over. You're the last. - I could be the worst of all. So, what have you got to say? Anything, just make sure it's nothing sad, 'cause Marisa gets pissed off. Marisa? The organiser. That blonde. She wants to see everyone smiling. Yes, she told me that too. Leave the sad stuff at home, keep the chat cheerful. You start. I'm at a loss for words tonight. - Want to try mine? - Is it alcoholic? - Vodka and tonic. - No, thanks. - You don't drink? - Depressing subject. Yes. Marisa won't be too pleased with us. How about you? Why do you come here? Bye. - Shall I give it to him? - Definitely. - It's at your own risk. - Sure! - Guido! - Marisa... Number3 from last week called me. She said you went out together and got on really really well. - Why don't you date her? - 'Cause you'll lose your best client! Been going to these evenings for long? Yes, a long time. Don't they depress you? Yes, they do. - How about a drink? - You don't drink. How about going to my place? - I got the wrong idea. - No, I'm on first shift tomorrow. It's late. What's so funny? Nothing. Just a silly game. It reminded me of someone. What game? It's like when you see a shooting star, you have to make a wish. Does it work? No. What's up? Nothing, why? Just wondered... It's already 2:00. - Shall I call you? - Yes. Bye. I don't have your number! Guido! Guido! I don't have your number! Hi Marisa. Fine. You? No problem, go ahead. Yes, I remember him. Really? Thanks. Yes. Good morning. Give him my number. Sure. Thank you. Bye. Good morning. Wait, Sonia. I'm going up too. Marco, the new concierge. Cute, huh? After Stefano I said: "No more good-looking men." You have to be beware of them, they drink. But then I can't resist. I can feel his eyes on me all day long. Say hello to him. Say "hi" to Marco. - You're in a good mood today. - Is that unusual? I've known you a month and you've smiled four times. And three of those were today. What's his name? Come on. Tell me. May I come in? Chambermaid. May I come in? Chambermaid. Here he comes. I'm sure he carries his wife's corpse is in that suitcase. - Good morning Margherita. - Good morning Mr Caminiti. - Is it already Tuesday? - Call me Bruno. Tuesday. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Is she new? - Sonia? No! - She's already been here a month. - Sonia... Bye. Sonia... I'm pleased you called me. I don't know many people here. I almost didn't. But I was curious. Someone like you in a place like that... With too many choices, you always end up making the wrong one. You don't know anything about me. There was a wood behind our house that went down to a river. I'd spend the whole day there. Then mom would come looking for me because she'd be worried. Then what? My mother died and I came here to stay with my father. He's Italian, from Ancona. He'd already started another family. It didn't work out, so I left and kept moving around. But now I'd like to stay here for a while. Why did you come to Turin? I don't know, maybe the river. You, show me your ID. Fuck you. - What did you say? - Fuck you. - Fuck who? - You! Fuck you! Guido. - You disappeared. - Never gone anywhere. Good boy, Guido, you look good. - Thanks. - Did I interrupt something? - Sonia. - Dante. I'll get going. Call me, huh? - Trouble with the police? - Me? From the look on your face... I've got some grass on me. - You are a cop. - I was. Then what? Then... nothing. Want to smoke? I'd better not. You go swimming often? Your hair... smells of chlorine. You were a good cop. Was your wood like this? If you want I'll make you a CD. I don't have much to do. It's not bad being a watchman, you don't even have to wear a uniform. I hate mine. I only wearit when the owneris here. - What's he like? - I've only met him three times. That's my colleague's wife. - There's nothing of yours here? - This. You listened to the wood through it. It's a shotgun mic, but I adapted it a bit. It has a hypercardioid valve with a frequency of 50 Hertz. It shoots at sound. Shotgun. Do you bring them all here? You're the first. Why me? That was my wife in the photo. - You're married. - I'm a widower. It's the first time I've ever used that word. - I'm sorry. - It's been three years now. I wasn't ready for you. Deactivate the security cameras. - Now the alarm. - It's switched off. You got in. The one in the house. Open the gate too. Sonia, don't worry, they'll be gone soon. They're not interested in us. I'm sorry. Put it in vertically. - How much stuff is there left? - Just bits and pieces. I said put it in vertically! Help him, I'm going back inside. I'll keep an eye on them. You looked so sweet togetherin the woods. Shame I interrupted you. Do you mind if I finish off with your girlfriend? You don't mind, do you? It takes guts to jump like that. If I was going to kill myself... pills. A good sleep and it's all over. Marco told me the manager wants to change the windows. He wants those anti-suicide ones. Know what I mean? The ones you can't open. Go home, I'll finish up here. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. - You know how much that bottle of perfume cost? - No. Don't bother guessing, I'll tell you: This go-go dancerbroke it. 'cause she's no chambermaid is she? I'm very sorry, I assure you we'll work something out. Do you only hire morons like herhere? What must I do with you? I don't want to be harsh. Well all know what you've been through and sympathize but what shall we do? We can't go on like this. Sonia... Sonia! Your mercy is boundless. Remind us constantly how brief and uncertain our earthly life is. May Your spirit guide us in holiness and justice all the days of our lives. Because after serving you in this life, in union with the Church... It was with his personal effects. I thought you might want it. Thanks. You made a nice couple. You haven't been here long. The bills are still in the previous tenant's name. I gave them my details, but it takes a while. What now? Are you going to stick around after what happened? - I haven't decided yet. - It's a real shame. You just start finding a bit of happiness again... and it all gets fucked up. Odd, isn't it? You set up a perfect alarm system and the one and only day you deactivate it so you can score with a woman... Coincidence. Yes, of course. - POLICE OFFICER - - For anything. - Thanks. Hey, it's clean. Good morning. My granny was right. You can tell a true gentleman by the way he treats his maids. Respect is very important. They used to address their parents formally at home. Okay, they were old fashioned. I'm not saying we should do the same thing today. But, anyway... Was there a man here? On the stairs? - Yes? - It's Margherita. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Me neither, it sucks. Shall we meet? - Oh, I don't know. - Come over to my place. I've got a stash of bottles from the minibar. No, I really don't feel like it. - Okay, but tomorrow after work... - Sorry, bye. - Margherita... - Sonia... Sonia! Sonia! - Night shift? - No, I forgot something. Would you like a coffee? I appreciate the problem, but I can't change the room now. Yes, I understand. Of course. Fine. Yes. If I had a free room, I'd move you immediately. Yes, afterbreakfast. Fine. I'll move you from 422 to 435. All right? Thank you. The bullet stopped here. It made a depression in the skull but didn't cause it to fragment. They'll have told you this at the hospital. Sometimes a millimetre makes a big difference. So there's no damage... - Everything's okay? - You're absolutely fine. Listen: you suffered a serious physical and mental shock. Take it easy, fill your time with pleasant things. I bought a globe yesterday. I put it on the bedside table, looked at it... What do I need a globe for? All I do is Collegno-Turin, Turin-Collegno every day. I could have bought a ticket for London instead. Possibly one-way. Have you been there? Do you mind if I don't come tonight? I'll show you something. Lovely. - Where was this taken? - It wasn't. Look at the bridge. It's in Buenos Aires. - I've never been there. - You haven't? A police officer gave it to me. He said Guido had it. It must be a photomontage. Maybe Guido wanted to take you and this was a nice way to tell you. Yes, maybe. Okay. We'll go out some other time. - Good evening, Mr Caminiti. - Bruno. - Knocking off? - Yes. Remember that touchy guy with the perfume? I ran into him earlier. What a lout! - He's a regularhere too. - Really? Don't worry. I convinced him to change hotels. - I have to go. Goodnight. - Do you have far to go? - I can give you a lift. - No thanks, I'm not going far. I insist. No, really. Thanks. Look who it is! Out on your own this late? There's lot of scum about. My car's parked nearby. Tell me, who called the ambulance that night? I told the police. I woke up in hospital, I don't remember. The thief killed Guido but took good care to save you. Doesn't make sense. - Unless... - They shot me! No, they shot Guido. But the bullet went through him and got lodged in your little head. I'm going home. Sonia... Can I sleep here? What's up? Are you okay? Margherita... - You nearly killed me. - That shouldn't have happened. No, it shouldn't have happened. You'd better go, there's a cop on my back. Lucky guy. And Dolores Dominguez? - Dead. - Already? I came to tell you in person. It's not what we agreed. I wanted to see you. Come here. - When's the funeral? - Monday. - We'll communicate the usual way. - With the red bed spread. Monday. And on Tuesday we'll have breakfast in Buenos Aires. I can't go on like this anymore. Yes you can. Has something happened? No, nothing. Look, it's the barman's number. Manuel. I deserve it, I spent 60 Euros at the bar. - A ticket to London! - Yeah, London. - Will you be able to drive? - Yes. - Sleep here if you want. - No, I miss my empty bed. - Marco? - Marco... - Coming to work tomorrow? - Yes. I didn't feel like it today, I called in sick. - Bye. - Bye. - Thanks for the lift. - Thank you. I had fun. You look better with your hair down. - Bye. - Bye. Guido... I'm here. What'll I do without you? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Please, go away. Any news of Margherita? She isn't here today either. Will you stop that for a second? - What's up with her? - I don't know. If you hear from her, tell her I'm pissed off. I've already got used to it with you. Nice style, so much commitment. You're following me. I just wanted to see you in your swimming costume. I had a chat with your father today. Know what he says about you? - I can guess. - No, you can't. Sorry. It's my fault we got off to a bad start. But mistakes can always be corrected. What did my father tell you? A sad story. His little girl asked him for money to help out her boyfriend. Being a good father, he not only refused, he stopped herfrom seeing him. So one day, he woke up... and found the house cleared out, cheque books, cash, jewellery. From that day on, he stopped having a daughter. I already know that. Right, I'll tell you something you don't know then. Your father wasn't at all surprised that morning. He was expecting it. He says there's something wrong with you, you're damaged. - It was a long time ago. - Sure, but people don't change. But perhaps you already knew that as well. Finished? I have to take a shower. - MARGHERITA BAGINI HAS PASSED AWAY - It happened yesterday. They say it was suicide. Go back to work, our guests need us. Come on. How did she do it? She threw herself out of the window. God, creator of heaven and earth, in the design of salvation you have united men to Christ's Eastertriumph. With baptism, we too participate in the glory of the Lord's resurrection. Bless the resting place of our sister, Sonia... Did he say Sonia? Calm down. Why did he say my name? - Calm down, let's go. - He said Sonia, didn't you hear? Christ our Lord, amen. Amen. - What is it? - Coffee... with a hint of liquor. Funerals put me in a good mood. I don't know why. But, if you think about it, death is our salvation. If there was time to do everything, no one would do anything anymore. You? What kind of funeral would you like? Which way are you going? Don't worry, I'll take you home. You look great in this dress, Sonia. Sonia... Sonia. Sonia... Sonia. Careful. Hi. What happened? Don't you remember anything? But you... I've always been here. What? - You were dead. - No. I got away with just a flesh wound. The bullet went through me and ended up there. - How long has it been? - Three days. I knew you'd wake up. I knew it. The CAT scan doesn't show any damage. - The bullet? - It just grazed you. It doesn't have anything to do with your coma. The emotional shock and consequent release of pressure caused a subarachnoid haemorrhage, don't be scared by the term, putting you in a coma. We did an angiography, obviously you weren't aware, but it didn't reveal any vascular abnormality. You're fine now, you can go home soon. I just don't get it. I went to work, went home... a friend died and I went to her funeral. It was all in my head. Don't worry. During a coma, perhaps the mind stays active, it shuffles the deck, superimposes memories, perceptions, places, faces. Some people claim they heard a song that was played to them. Others swear they were awakened... ...by the voice of a loved one. - What'll I do without you? I'll do it. - Thanks. - That's okay. Hi, Margherita. - How are you? - You're asking about me? Well, if you really want to know... - Remember Marco? - Sure. I think I love him. But I only realized after I cheated on him with Lorenzo. Lorenzo, the manager of the hotel. I even had to call him "sir" in bed! They all come my way. The doctors gave me permission to bother you. Just a couple of minutes. Did you notice anything particular that might help us? - Did you see their faces? - They wore balaclavas. Did they call each other by name, or have unusual accents? - I'm sorry, I don't remember. - All right. I don't want to tire you. I'll leave you in peace. Let's do this... If anything comes to mind, call me. Did they call my father? They tried, but he couldn't come. Sure. - What's that? - My new office. I wasn't a very good watchman. Now what? Let's go in. I'd started it... before. All I can offer you is a glass of tap water. Get some sleep. You saved me. I just watched you sleep. How do you feel? Different. A lot of stuff. It'll make them a couple of million, maybe two and a half. Sit down. How are you? Fine, thanks. - And Sonia? - She's fine too now. I'm pleased. Take a look. Remember Monica? Yes, I do. You don't know, but we were lovers for a year before... then she left her husband and got together with me. The bullshit she used to tell that poor guy while I was in bed with her! The day I married her l thought: "What if she does the same with me?" But you married her anyway. We always hope it won't happen to us. Sure. Like hell, she cheated on me too. I won't read that file, Dante. - Don't you want to know who she is? - I already do. Even you guessed they were professionals. - You were a cop, for God's sake! - Cop... I spent the whole day tapping phones. - Shut up inside a van. - They used her to get at you. - That bullet wasn't for her. - You piss me off. - Yes? - Yes. You know who's pissed off? Giorgio Bechis, her dad. Know what he said when I told him his daughter was in a coma? She died twelve years ago in his eyes, when she ransacked his house and left with a guy. What did he do? Did he report her? - No. - Got any proof? Phone calls, bank operations? No. - Leave us in peace. - What if she does that to you? If she goes out one day and doesn't come back? Bye, Dante. Hello? Hello? Dad... Have you recovered? Yes. Good. Hello. They're cancelling now? I'm left with 30 women and 20 men. Be patient, how do I know... I'll call you back in a minute. Guido! Marisa... Guido, my dear. How are you? - And Sonia? - She's fine now. Damn you. I hoped to see you in the marriage announcements not the crime news. It's a first step. So, what are you doing here? I came to say goodbye, this time you really have lost your best client. I knew she was the right girl. Now I can tell you. She wanted to meet you at all costs. She joined a group session because she was shy. But really, she was there for you. - Hi. - Hi. - What are you doing? - Looking at job advertisements. Anything? - Want some coffee? - Yes. - THE FUNERAL OF DOLORES DOMINGUEZ IS AT ONE O'CLOCK TODAY - What time is it? - Almost 11:00. - Already! Thanks. I have to go out. I promised Margherita I'd drop by. - Will you be back late? - No, I don't think so. Stay if you want. - Your coffee. - Thanks. Help me put it on. As soon as I bought it, I regretted it. No, it's beautiful. Thanks. I don't know whether I really want to go. Margherita wants some advice from me. She cheated on her boyfriend and doesn't know if she should tell him. Who knows... maybe he already figured it out. And he wouldn't trust her again. That's what I thought. Hi. Look what I did to you. Does it hurt? What does it matter? It matters to me. What should I have done? Come to the hospital and put everything at risk? Of course not. The money's already in the bank in Buenos Aires. That bastard even wanted a discount. He kept that small Degas you really liked. Here's your new passport. What's up? The watchman figured it all out. Will he cause trouble? I don't know. No. Let's go. Guido. Guido? Are you there? Guido? Hello? Hello? This is the last time we run. I promise. Thanks, goodbye. Good morning. Luggage? You board at gate 23. And this one is for the connection for Buenos Aires. You don't need to check-in again in Rome. Mrs Dominguez!
