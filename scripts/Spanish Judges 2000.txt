See, here's the deal. Hand over the judges to me, right now. I'll see what I can do about saving your life. Who's gonna save your ass, bro'? Motherfucker! ( humming ) Mmmm! Hi there! - Oh, my God! - I'm sorry, I just-- Why-- How did you get in? The front door-- I came in-- I came through the door. Are you a cop? Do I look like a cop? Answer the question. Max gave me a key. I'm his brother, Jack. What? It's nice to meet you. Okay, I'm sorry. I completely apologize, all right? All right? ( chuckle ) Jesus! Ooh! You guys have got a great place. This place, it's great. Really nice. This stuff here... Which one ofyou is the collector? 'Cause this stuff looks like it could be in a museum. Okay, I'm cool. Max doesn't have a brother, asshole. We're not that close, that's all. Shut up! Argh! You know, I really wish you wouldn't do that. Shut the fuck up. Where is your gun? I don't have a gun. You have very soft hands. You're starting to piss me off. I don't want to hurt you. I didn't come here to steal any of your shit-- - What did you have in mind? - Nothing, I'm Max's brother-- Okay, now I'm pissed off! Max's brother wouldn't be carrying a little thing like that. I don't have a complex about the size of my knife. Maybe you should. Max has a knife. He has a very big knife. I remember the size of my brother's knife. You're Jamie. He met you in New Orleans, the summer he was doing long hauls. It was five years ago, wasn't it? Five years ago. He said you were crazy. - Max said that? - Yeah, he did! - When did you see him last? - Long time ago. Last time I saw him was the day he left home. I was 16. It was nine years ago. When did he give you the key? He mailed it to me. Ah? I understand he's been working in the collection business the past couple ofyears. - So? - I might have a job for him. - What is it? - A job. Quick, easy. He would make some real cash. What's real cash? I'll wait till my brother gets home. That's a good idea. We'll get along justfine, Jamie. I have a good feeling about this. Me, too, Jack. I have goosepimples. ( bell rings ) Ladies and gentlemen, the next item for bid is lot #54. An original 17th century German presentation sword, with highly polished straight double-edged 34-inch blade. I will open the bidding at $5,000. Do I hear $5,000? Let me hear five. Here's five. Max, that's your stuff. You need that right now, while I take that woman. Lord have mercy. Studs in the belly and all. ( man laughs ) You know what I bought here last week? A moose's head. A fuckin' moose's head. It weighed near 300 pounds. You know something? My wife loves it. 'Cause they stole it from Coppola's house, and Coppola's her all-time favorite director. Ha ha. Shit! Love, right? That's what it is. Ninety-five going once, twice, three times to the gentlemen right here, number 77, front table. Thank you. ( bell rings ) $20,000 and a moose's head and she love's my ass forever. I haven't seen you buy nothing yet today. You ain't going cheap on us or something? You used to be the fiercest one in this whole place. Always down there in the front row. Now your ass is hanging back here with these damned cheapskates. I can't remember the last time I've seen your hand raised. You ain't going cheap on us? You're not broke, are you Max? Oh, goddamn! Oh, shit! You're broke? You need a job. Hey, come over here. Give him a size... Iarge. And a hat to go with it. That's a damned shame. A grown man, ain't got a pot to piss in, or a window to throw it out of. I'm gonna have this thing fixed up in a jif. - Here. - Thank you. He's going to kill me. I'm telling you, he's gonna be very happy to see me. I'm talking about the chair. This thing's not worth anything. Don't tell me, you work at Sotheby's? No, I don't. But I do know fine things when I see them. You want a drink? Yes, please. I'll have whatever you're having. - Good choice. - Thank you. So what do you do? Do you work with Max? Yep. Max and I work together, so what? - You're so defensive. - So what? There you go. Look at that, huh? Good as new. I am good. So, is this your collection? No. That's Max's stuff. I collect other kinds of shit. What other kind of shit do you collect? - You know, the usual. - Yeah? Barbie dolls, baseball cards... ingestible poisons. That's cute. Oh, come on. - That better? - That's much better. Cheers. Thank you. You don't trust me, Jack? I don't know you, Jamie. ( Jack chokes ) Let me see. Oops. How... does itfeel? Are your hands getting numb? Okay. Are you feeling numb? Here, how many fingers am I-- How many fingers am I holding? That's all right, don't worry. I'll just watch you. It's okay, relax. Enjoy. Be careful with that. Be careful. Well, always next time, huh, Maxie boy? Always next time. Hold on, if you help me load this stuff in this trunk, maybe I'll give you one of these candlesticks. Light your way back home. Plus two or three dollars. 'Cause ain't no romance without no goddamned pot. Motherfucker's broke. Hey! Sorry, Jack. Maybe you are Max's brother, maybe you aren't. But I can't afford to fuck around, you know? - What did you do to me? - Ornithogalum umbellatum. Star of Bethlehem. It's 50 milligrams, it shouldn't last too long. Don't do that. I feel like shit. Don't move too much, okay? I really rather you didn't do that. I learned this while I was doing Juvie time at Tryon. I can never get enough practice. So-- How do I look? Well, nothing like Max, but not too bad. ( banging on door ) ( banging on door ) - Don't wander off. - Man: Max, let me in! Max! Max! Max! Shut up. What? - Max not back yet? - No. He's not back yet. All right. What? You're not gonna do "Piece, come in"? Piece, come in. What is that? Hi, baby. God, I hate this place. - What? - It gives me the creeps. This is-- I worry about you. It's so-- It's all this shit. I'm helpless, I'm a woman. What do you want me to do? Why did you come back for? Wellings, he rooked us. You mean you screwed up. No, I didn't screw up. I went and did a pick up for Max at Wellings' but he... rooked us. Two grand short. Two grand! Max sent you on a job by yourself? Yes. What? I'm doing things by myself all the time. What is this? I've got responsibilities. Remember last week? Remember, when I went for the movie guy's face? Remember that? Whose idea was that? That was my idea, taking the face instead of the body. Because he's a movie guy. That was me, "face." All me, "face"! Because of that, Max gives you Wellings? What did the fucker buy? VCRs, TVs. The same things he always buys. VCRs and TVs. Can I have a bucket, please? - Who are you? - No, no! Piece! Who are you? Who are you? - He's Max's brother. - I'm Max's brother. - Hold it! He's Max's brother. - I'm Max's brother. Max's brother. Why do you have Max's brother tied to a chair for? Because, he probably isn't Max's brother-- What is it that you need? What is it? Wellings! Wellings. What are we gonna do? He rooked us! We? This is your screw up. Why didn't you count the money when he gave it to you? I didn't think I had to. We've been working with this guy five, six-- I don't know how many months. I trusted him. Piece, you're a crook! What are you doing trusting anybody? That's it! That is it, that's-- I got in this mess because I-- because I trusted you! That envelope was on the table in front of us the whole time we were sitting there. I mean, you could have counted that. You could have counted-- Why didn't you count the money? I couldn't do it, it would've been impolite. Now I look like an idiot in front of Max's friend. Brother. Whatever! God! The point is that-- I don't know what the point is. Stupid-- You're stupid. You're a stupid bitch! - Jamie: Where are you going? - To get my money. Yo. Did I tell you to come with me? Stay here. You can't come with me. You call him a cheat and he'll shoot you dead. - Piece: Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Come here, baby. ( door slams ) Oh, that's Jack, honey. At least that's what we're calling him for now. - Who are you? - You mean right now? She's from another planet. Do you want to talk to her? Do you want to hear stories about meteors and comets and little green men? Of course that doesn't make her any more full of shit than you are. Baby, why don't you go and get Angie? I'll go get Angie now. I'm from Mars. Martians know all your secrets. Psst! Get in there. What is that all about? Ask Piece, she's his. He picked her up a while ago when we were living in New Orleans. She was trying to sell magnolia blossoms to the people. Baby: Fly! What are you doing? What did I tell you? - Sorry. - That's okay. So anyway, she was trying to sell these flowers and she had the idea all wrong. She was actually paying people to take the things from her. When we were getting ready to leave town, Piece decides to bring her along. I guess it makes him feel important to have a human pet. I hope it makes him feel good about himself. He ain't doing shitfor her. She's better off on the street. Being owned is better than starving to death. Bullshit. It's a pity you don't look anything alike. I always hoped Max had an identical twin. Somebody with his face and someone else's head. ( singing lullaby ) Jamie, Max is crazy. I don't know what he'll do if he finds his brother tied to a chair. Hmm? The shit I get talked into. ( door opens ) Jamie! If I don't get a cashew nut, I'm gonna puke! Jamie! Jamie! Jamie, we're moving on. Close up your deals, don't take on anymore. We are no longer residents ofthis stinkhole city. I have not had a pleasant stay in the city of Los Angeles. I have had a profitable stay, in the city of Los Angeles. But that's okay. That's okay. Because I've learned something. And when I'm learning something, nobody can say that I'm moving assways. You know what I learned? I learned you can't get back respect once you've lost it. Do you remember when we first came to this city? People would see me and they would say, "That man has had some success." "That man has success written all over him." "That is a successful man." And they all treated me accordingly. You know? Nice comments about my shoes, my clothes, valet parking... Yeah! A couple of bad things-- a few weeks-- A couple of lousy bad months, and what do I get? I get 10 tuxedo-less freaks with serving trays, and not one Goddamned nut in the whole place. Here, baby. Oh. No! Yeah. Don't you give me any lip about moving again, either. We're gonna have a fresh start. Maybe Chicago, or Detroit. Somewhere new. Somewhere that I can be treated like a... Iike a successful man. Want to be a successful man, Max? Where did you come from? I've been sitting right here the whole time. New boyfriend, Sister Mary Agnes? He says he's your brother, Jack. My brother? Nice to see you again, bro'. Particularly since, we've never seen each other before. Particularly since, I don't have a brother. And since I never have had a brother. I could be considered brother-less. I find it very interesting. Why don't you explain it to me? Apparently I'm not his brother after all. I should have just shot you. Why don't you? Jack? Jack, if that's your real name? It's as good as any. What do we do now, Jack? What do you wanna do? Jack: Ooh! God! I was sent here by a friend of yours, Bernie Nick. Bernie Nick! Max: Yeah, I know Bernie. So, how do I know you know him? He's the one who told me the story about New Orleans, and the long hauls, right? I had it right, Jamie. Didn't I have it right? Max: So what? Bernie's a dick. I don't trust him. Jack: I know, neither do I. If I had I would have used him, but instead... I want to use you. Use us for what? I have a proposition, a little business proposition. A collection tonight. It's a big take, very minimum risk. How big, how minimum? It's a million dollars in cash. What do you think? And how much of the money comes our way? I was thinking 5%... How about 10%, $100,000 each? $100,000 a head? Jamie: Oh, yeah. Yeah what? Max: We don't even know whatwe're doing. You wantthe long version, or the shortversion? - Shortversion. - I need protection. Give me the long version. All right! The long version. Eight months ago, in San Francisco, my friends and I were hired to obtain some merchandise. A set ofvery rare antiques from the court of King Charles IV of Spain. They were known as the "Spanish Judges." The guy was willing to pay very well for them, no questions, all ofthat. He showed us the house and the merchandise was in. We spent nearly two weeks getting our plan together. But when we finally moved in, another group of hired thieves had beaten us to the punch. The Spanish Judges were gone. They disappeared earlier that night. Like I said, the pieces were in demand. My associate and I went back to our employer with the bad news. He was furious. He took it out on my bestfriend's skull. They beat him within an inch of his life. And once it was over, he hired us right back again. He just couldn't let go ofthe idea of having the Judges all to himself. - You follow? - Max: Sure. Sure, he sent you and your crooks to rub out the other crooks for a better price. Six months and five cities, until we finally found them. They had been holed up in this little motel, right outside ofTucson. We confronted them. We didn't really know what we were doing and then, one of them just started shooting. And all hell broke loose. ( gunshots ) I saw my companions get gunned down one by one, including my bestfriend. ( dog barking ) Excuse me. When I searched the car, it almost seemed worth it, because there, in all their glory, were the Spanish Judges. That's a crying shame. You've got this bright and shiny merchandise, and nobody to share it with. What I'm telling you is, I need your help here. You can make a really smart choice and make a lot of money really quickly, really easily, or you can let go ofthe rope and drop me offthe edge. But I really wish you'd make up your mind. Okay? 'Cause I'm wet, and I'm cold, and to tell you the truth... I'm not too fond of the view. Jamie, I don't know what you're thinking. I don't know what the fuck you're thinking. - ( speaks Italian ) - What, huh, what? Stop whining. We're taking the offer. - Why, because you said? - Yeah! You make the decisions? No, I make the decision. - You need the money. - Shut the fuck up! We need the money. We need the money. We need-- You're sounding like a wife! We can't say no, and you know it. This is not what we do. We are not bodyguards. We are crooks! We don't know if he has a decent plan. Jack, what's your plan? We're set to meet at midnight in a warehouse on Hartford. I've got the merchandise. I've got a rented van. All I need is back-up. All you need to do is watch my sorry ass. We can do that. We can watch his sorry ass. We can definitely do that. Between you, Piece and me, we can definitely-- - What? - Piece. What? Wellings might have shot him two hours ago. When were you gonna tell me that? Itjust didn't come up. Well, is he dead or alive? You know Wellings. I mean-- Don't even try. Don't even think about doing this without Piece. - No. Right? - I'm not. I'm not going to go deal with Wellings. - Sorry. I'm sorry. - You're sorry for what? I've done my research on both of you. You're both very capable people, but in all due respect, when it comes to guns, neither one of you can hit the broad side of a barn. It was very nice meeting both of you, but I'm gonna take my business elsewhere, thank you. Sit the fuck down. Sit the fuck down! You know what? I'm gonna sit down. - We'll be right back. - I'm sitting. Jamie: You want to go to Wellings? Are you crazy? No, we're gonna go to Wellings, smart-ass. - Why? - Why? Because we need the fucking money, that's why. Okay, okay. Okay. What are we gonna do about him? - Jamie: I don't-- - I don't want him around my stuff. I'm not coming with you and risk getting my ass shot. Jack: Aw, come on! Come on in here! Don't be shy, it's nice to see the both of you. Good evening, Mugs. How are you doing tonight? I see you're cooking up a little dinner for yourself. A friend of mine mixed this up for me. Don't know what it is, don't know what it does, but I can't wait to find out. You should let me mix up something for you sometime. Oh, no, I know everything about you, Spider Lady. Not quite everything. ( moaning ) - How are you doing, Piece? - Fine, and you? Good. So Piece, you can do things on your own? - You can handle things by-- - Max: You guys finished? - Mmm? - Huh? Piece: Yeah? Well, I'm glad to see you didn't... rush the judgement on our little friend there. What did he say to you? He called me a cheat. - Piece: That's right! - Said I rooked him! - But you did rook him. - So I made a mistake. Okay. I ain't got to hear about itfrom the likes of you. People like you deserve whatever they get. Okay. Let's talk through this, Wellings. Let's talk about money. ( girl humming ) I saw you looking. ( giggles ) Look at that, it's 9:00. It's 9:00 on the nose. Come on. Didn't Max tell you to untie me at 9:00? Isn't that what he said, "9:00, untie him"? No. He didn't say you couldn't untie me at 9:00, did he? Yes, he did. ( laughs ) Max: So, what are you gonna charge us for, our friend hanging from the ceiling? Five grand. Five grand, that's fine. That's good, five grand. I'll tell you what, Jamie and I, tomorrow, we'll bring you $3,000 worth of merchandise. Okay? $3,000 of equipment, whatever you need. That plus the mistaken two comes to five. - Max: We're even. - Fine. - And Rude Boy... - Piece: Twit! can stay here and spend the night with me. Wellings: We'll have some fun. You motherfucking lucky son of a bitch! Shut the fuck up! ( Wellings chuckles ) I know, it's funny. I have $3,000 here. I do. Here's three thousand. You see? This is a marker for you. I'm gonna give it to Jamie. And Jamie, she's gonna put it in an envelope and seal it, and give it back to you. You see? You hold on to that tonight as a marker. Tomorrow, I'm gonna bring the $3,000 worth of merchandise, and give it to you, and of course, you'll give me back the envelope. But he goes now. Correct. Okay. So, I assume there is a key? Right. Okay. - Piece this yours? - Yeah! Bring me some tuners! I need some good tuners! I've heard a lot about you. - About me? - Oh, yeah, sure! Everybody has heard about "The Girl from Mars." It's in all the newspapers. And I can tell you, my friends are gonna be very jealous when I'll tell them I met you. Oh, how jealous they'll be. - Really? - Sure. Every man in America wants to meet a girl from Mars, especially one with beautiful eyes like you have. No, no. I don't want an American man. I want a man from Mars. What's your name? Really, what's your name? Can't say. I'm not gonna tell Max or Jamie or anything. Cross my heart and hope to die. No. Okay. How about I call you-- I call you... Mars Girl? You like that, don't you? I'll tell you what, Mars Girl, you want to meet Mars boys? You gotta go way back to Mars. And you're gonna need a lot of money. So why don't you come over right now, and reach into my pocket. Come here, Mars Girl, reach into my pocket. What are you laughing at? Reach into my pocket. - Mars Girl: No! - No? I don't need money to get to Mars. Someone will come for me. - They will, huh? - Uh huh. Someday, a beautiful stranger will come, and take me back to where I really belong. Then, I'll be truly happy. Maybe I'm the beautiful stranger? No! Men where I come from don't have scars. Piece: It was a goddamned good fight in there. Very slick talking in there, Brother Pio. Very slick hands, Sister Mary Agnes. Thank you. Merci! I knew itwas coming, I didn't even see it. - What did you put in there? - Coupons from Radio Shack. Here. Where would you find $3,000 in cash? Jack's wallet. Who carries that kind of money around anyway? Successful people, baby. Jamie, what we do back there, we did well. We should stick with what we do well. What we did back there is not gonna make us $100,000 each, baby. 1-0-0-0-0-0. What? I've got a bad feeling about this guy. - Something's gonna go wrong. - It's gonna be too easy. - Come on, Piece, let's go! - Where? I want to go to Piece's apartment. He's gonna pick outfor me a nice gun for tonight. You go home. Hey, go home. Get the mannequins ready, we'll be there in... - Whatfor? -...a few minutes. - Get... get out. - Jamie: Come on, come on! - Piece: Whatfor? - Get out ofthe-- Jamie: Just get going! Why? Because you say so? Huh? Because you say so? ( Jamie blows a kiss ) Fine. Fine. I've got a hole in my wrist. You're lucky it's not around your neck. Help me out here. What are you doing? One of Jamie's stupid ideas. You dress the mannequins up, put them in the car, park it in front ofthe warehouse, and when these people see it-- they think you've got an army of backups. - It's a genius idea. - I know. Maybe I'm talking to the wrong person. I just naturally figured that you were in charge but-- Oh, I'm sorry. I am on your team. I just-- I don't know why everyone else doesn'tfeel that way. Are you talking about Jamie? Well, the whole thing. Yeah. Well, she used to. You know what bothers me about you people, Max? I haven't seen a single gun since I've been here. Unless you're talking about these. Hey, hey, hey! First of all, don't go snooping around and touching my things. Secondly, they're not guns. They're antiques. French flintlocks. It's my newest addition. Oh! That is nice. Old dueling pistols. They come in a boxed set. - Yeah? - Yeah. Max: I don't have all the literature on them yet. I've only had them for a month or so. - Max: But eventually-- - Where are they from? See the tag? It says LaRoche. That's French, LaRoche. What does it mean, LaRoche? Max: It doesn't mean anything, it's a town in France. Quite grim, aren't they? Yeah. Jack: Guns make me nervous. - I never carry one. - I see you there. Ifyou need a gun, you're doing something wrong. That's why Piece has so many. He does everything wrong. Collecting is about patience, Jack. Unless you've got a lot of money, you can put all your collection together at once. You see this burgonet here? Fifteenth century. It's part of a complete set of armor made by the Massiglia family of Milano. I only have the helmet right now, but, I know a guy who has the pauldrons. I want to get it all together, you know, bit by bit. That's okay. I have what I have. What I have makes me happy. That's beautiful. It really is. So is a new Caddy. So is new furniture. So why do you have a cabinetfull of antiques? Why does your guy want the Spanish Judges? For the beauty? For an investment? No. Antiques are not about money. Not even about the beauty. They're about ownership. They're about position. They're about... success. They're about saying, "I have the power to reach back into the past, and grab anything I want and make it mine." An antique can say that. A new Caddy can never say that. I understand completely. You think a lot about that, about being a successful man. About being treated the way you deserve to be treated. We all get there. You'll see. - Detroit. - Detroit. Detroit. Or maybe Chicago after that. Here's to Texas, a year after that. We have chosen a very tough business. It's hard enough to go out alone, and you've got all these dependents. That's my problem. If I was an independent operator again, I'd get it like that. Like that. - Jamie. - Jamie. What does she know about being successful? Have you seen-- Do you know what she has in the closet back there? - You're talking about the poisons - Unbelievable! Unbelievable. With a job like ours, a hobby like that. And don't think it makes for comfortable living arrangements. Every time we get in a fight, I have to stay up all night and listen... Iisten for the closet door to open. That ain't right. It's selfish, that's what it is. The bitch. What? Nothing. Yeah, you said something. What did you say? - Nothing. - Jamie: Hello, gentlemen. My life is such a mess. Hello, gentlemen. Is he getting funny with the mannequins again? Are you? I'm gonna be up on the roof. At 11:15, come get me. All right. You know, this better be on level, right? I mean like, it better be like everything you say. Don't worry about it, Piece. - Girl, girl. - Uh-oh. - How you've been? - ( screaming ) Why don't you get some sleep. We're gonna go in a couple of hours. I want to go over the plan again. We'll have plenty of time when you get back. - Come on. - What-- Great. Let's go. Bye! It looks good on you. The gun. You know how to use it? I've used it a couple of times. But Max just won't allow it in the house. Why? Because, when we fight, we fight. Oh, yeah? Did he hit you? No, you did it. You did that. It doesn't hurt, though. - It doesn't hurt? - No. Is this a challenge? Where are you going? ( shower running ) ( knocking ) Hey. You seem to be in a much better mood than when I first met you. You brought some excitement into my life, Jack. Glad to hear it. Why did Max go up on the roof? He goes there to think, you know? Max likes to have everything thought out in advance. That's why tonight makes him so nervous. Yeah? What makes you nervous? Max. He's a very bad boy, Jack. Very bad boy. Very jealous boy. You wouldn't want him jumping to conclusions. Max is on the roof. What Max doesn't know won't hurt him. - All right. - What else makes you nervous? Not much. I like surprises. That's why Max and I are so unhealthy together. Because he's a control freak. And, I'm just not that kind of girl. I can see that. Why do you stay? You can find better. I'm looking for something else. I can see that. But you just don't walk away from a man like Max. He's very determined. Of course, I'm at your service. Do you really know what your getting into? Oh, yeah! No, not really, I don't. I know what you want. Oh, no, not again. - Okay. - You're gonna learn to love it. ( door slams ) Hey. Jack wanted to wash up. How about napping with me, for a few minutes? It's time to go. All right, go on upstairs. Waitfor us, we'll be back soon. No, you cannot come with us. Cannot! She'll be quiet. She will. She'll be quiet. You drive really fucking slow for a bad guy. ( blows horn ) You're sure you want want to get out of the van by yourself? No, but that's what I told them I'd do. I don't want to do something and scare them. Watch me in the rear-view mirror. If you see something-- I signal Piece and start shooting. Hey, Piece? Try to miss me, all right? Don't worry Jack, I never miss. Well, that's great. That's really great. Shhh! A gun. Can I borrow a gun for this? I told you, I don't carry guns. That's great. That's great protection I'm getting for my money. ( tires screeching ) How you doing, buckaroo? If everything is okay, you signal, correct? Then you come out with the boxes. Right. Okay. Hold this. - Oh, shit. - I'm sorry. You bastard. Aah! Gun! He's got a gun! - What? - He's got a gun. It's all right. You get on over in the corner. Go! Come on! Piece: All right. It's all right, I got it. - Piece! - Piece! Go! Go! Go! Go backwards. Get the fucking money, now! That's it, that's it. - Well, go get it! - I'm going, I'm going. Jamie: What the hell are you guys doing? I've almost got it. Jack! Come on. Come on. Piece! Max: Piece! You okay? Are you okay? Huh? Pow! Pow! ( girl laughing ) It's okay. It's okay. She's okay. Pow! She thought it was funny. That's great. Will you take this thing off? People can see you. We're gonna get pulled over. It's gonna be your fucking fault. Ah! I can't get it. It's got these code things. Okay. Let's go. - What are you doing? - Hairs in the carpet and stuff. Okay. Gloves. Everybody had their gloves on, yes? Nobody touched anything without their gloves? Is that correct? Right. Shit. I didn't even think about it. You are a problem. What are we gonna do about this? Torch the van. Piece: Torch the van. Piece: Right? No, we're not gonna torch the van. You and I are gonna come back tomorrow morning. We'll get rid ofthis. Nobody will find it before then. Good. Can we go now? Come on, you ready? Don't worry, Jack. I'll protect you. Protect me from what? Is anything else gonna go wrong? Yeah. You can tell me now. What happened in there? What you saw is what went on. I didn't see anything. I didn't see a damn thing. Jack said somebody pulled a gun on him. He said hit him, so I hit him. Max, is that true? Jack: I can't get the case open. I can open it with my x-ray vision. Jamie: It doesn't make any sense. Why didn't they waitfor Jack to get away from the van first? Just shut the fuck up for a while. You make so much noise. What about you? You were to be the lookout. The lookout! You were supposed to be watching. Why did Jack have to see the fucking gun? You were supposed to be watching. You're really starting to piss me off. You know what we need? A rock or an electric drill. Does anyone have a drill? Something? Anything? You know what I'll do? I'll ask my Super. He's probably the only one in this goddamned city that doesn't know what we did yet. - You're being a prick. - I can open it with my-- You're always being a prick. I'm thinking that I think, that you're not thinking who you're talking to. Jamie: Sure, I do. I'm talking to a prick. All right, that's it. Come here, you. Get back in the fucking car. You, get out of the way. - Jamie: Aah! - Piece: Hey! Jack: Okay, okay, okay. - You will not hurt Jamie again. - What did I do? Jack: No, that's enough. Listen to me. We've got the case. Nobody's hurt. These are good things. We need to focus right now on getting the thing open. Does anyone have an idea on how to open the case? I can open it with my x-ray vision. - Piece: Oh, girl... - Max: Shut the fuck up! I got an electric drill at home. There you go, drill. Drill at home. Let's go. - Max: I'll drop you off. - You'll drop me off? Yeah. We'll wait at the apartment, and you can fucking walk. You okay, baby? - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. Good. That way, we'll walk back to the 7-Eleven maybe we can get some watermelon popsicles. Piece, we want to do this tonight, okay? Leave the girl with us. You go, pick up the fucking drill and come back home. Enough already. Okay? Let's go. Come on. No. I have your solemn word you will protect these women if I leave them with... whatever over there. Yes, you have my word. - I'm "whatever" now. - Okay! Get in the car. That's what you're so upset about. I mean, you wet your pants, you could have said so. Could we all shut up for a while until Piece comes back? I can open it with my x-ray vision. Get rid of her. Get her out of here. I am sorely tempted to tear her fucking tongue out. Let's go to my room. Prick! - Bye, Jack. - Night, Mars Girl. What? I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I am gonna kill her. What? That white-faced, lily-livered, jong-loving, hot-blooded whore, talk to me like that. I can talk plenty. Did you hear the stuff she was saying? - Yeah. - Were you a witness to that? - I said, yeah. - I am not some hoodlum. I am not some low-life scum that hangs around a street corner store. What's a guy gonna do? I run a pretty tight ship. That's truth under the circumstances of having more dependents than God, I might add-- ( yelling in Italian ) Jamie: I'm trying to put the kid to sleep. - Then try harder. - Jack...? Is he boring you? Do you want a break? - No. - No, no, no. There's no teaming up on me in my household. What? Did she tell you she was in prison? She mentioned it. Juvenile. But did she tell you why? No, she told you? But she made me promise, I can't tell you. - Yeah. - I can't-- - What did she do? - I-- I think under the circumstances it's something you should know. What did she do? She killed her parents. ( banging ) Shh. Stop. Stop. - She told you that? - Yeah, she said that. She's 10 years-old, gets taken out of the school play because she's not doing her homework. So little Jamie steals a jar offormaldehyde. Next thing you know, her parents are drinking it. - Her own parents. - It's a wretched fucking thing. The hand that's feeding her, chopping it the fuck off. That's exactly what I thought. That's exact-- Fuck! I was right all along. - About what? - That's exactly it. She goes after the people that take care of her. Right. Right. But she wants to be taken care of. That's the clincher. People that she can rely on... Iike me. She seeks us out. And the minute she's feeling a little fenced-in, or something better comes along. Oh, I got it. - Formaldehyde. - Formaldehyde. Exactly. I thought you should know, Max. Max: I could wrestle her to the ground, and choke her to death. I could tear her to bits. Do it, Max. Do it. Go in there and take care of business right now. Come on. - Huh? - No, it wouldn't work. She doesn't wrestle to the ground easy, I'd have to take out my gun, shoot her, and wake up the neighbors. I thought you told Piece you were gonna protect the women? I lied. I like to lie. It makes me feel all tingly inside. It makes me really want to kick your ass. And you know what else? You know with all this excitement, I forgot I wanted to kill you, too. Why? In the warehouse, your guy did not pull a gun. - You didn't see anything. - You know what I did see? What? When he got back up, he went like this. You want to tell me how his gun got back in his holster? Hmm? This whole thing would have gone down clean if you hadn't bent it out of shape. You want to explain why you did that? - I have my reasons. - They better be good. I have reasons that don't concern you. No, I will shoot you through the head. You don't want to wake up the neighbors. Shit! Are you all right? Oh, you little-- Is he here for me? - Calm down, Max. - Oh, you-- What the hell is going on in there? Nothing. It's like having a mother in the house. I just want to kill so many people. This whole thing is getting way too complicated. You know what? Just worry about Jamie. As far as the events in the warehouse, you gave your protection, you know what? You're gonna get what's coming to you. Anything outside of that is my business. Leave it alone. - Think so? - Yeah, I think so. Let me ask you a little question, why didn't we waitfor Piece? Why didn't we just pick up Piece? You got a dead body you hadn't planned for, you got dirty prints all over an abandoned van, you got two eyewitnesses; the only face they see is Piece's. It wouldn't be that you and Jamie are planning a little deviation of your own? That's none of your business. Exactly. Piece will be here any time now. So are we gonna do this, or aren't we? Um-hmm. So, I'm gonna go and get something ready. As long as he's with you, he's leading these guys back to your front door. Leave him behind, the cops arrest him, he's gonna talk. It's the only thing you can do. I know. Now you get another share. Of course, you could have all three shares... - if you wanted. - Yes, I could. Yes. I'm just saying, ifyou think that she's gonna do to you what she did to her own parents-- Huh? No, she's not gonna do that to me. ( knocking on door ) - ( knocking ) - Should we go get it? Okay. Jamie, show time. Are you sure you want to do this? - Someone's got to suffer. - Yeah, but Piece? He stood up for you when Max wanted to knock your teeth out. What's your point? Are you sure you're doing the right guy? Hmm? Go. Come on. Come on. - Just think about it. - Okay. All right. Hurry. Go. Go. Go. Go. Shit. We were just talking about you. - Yeah? - Jamie, Piece is here! - Hey. - Hey. I got the drill. - Jamie: Great. - Wonderful. Anything strange happen on the way here? - Yeah? - No. - Where's the girl? - Jamie: Sleeping. Anyone follow you or...? No. - What's going on? - Nothing. You wanna try and open the case? - Yeah, well.. - Right there. ( drill whirring ) Are you guys as excited as I am? - More. - Jamie: Yeah. ( groaning ) Watch my stuff! Watch my stuff! No! No guns! ( groaning ) I don't know where you live, but gunshots are reported in my neighborhood. ( gagging ) Guys? Thanks for the help. Well, we did it. Let's get this body out of here until we're ready to dump it. Dead bodies. I don't like looking at them. The girl is sleeping in the bedroom. We'll just-- we'll throw him in the bathtub. All right? Come on and grab his feet. Jack: Get the door. Jamie: Shh! You'll wake her. - You know, Jack? - Hmm. We were talking about that guy that you set us up to kill for no reason. - Remember? - I remember the conversation. I think I figured out the reason. - Yeah? - You want to hear it? It's probably not what you're thinking. I think those boxes of yours are empty. I think that there are no Spanish Judges. I think this was a set-up from the beginning. A little shooting and you get paid for something you never had. Well, that's pretty slick. We get paid. As soon as you get that case open, we get paid. Funny, I'm beginning to think that I'm getting rooked again. Nothing has gone straight in this deal so far. He looks comfortable. Here. Let me do this. There's money in that case. That guy trusts me completely. Well then he deserves what he got. Jack: Come on. Jack: Come on. Tell her to hurry up. Will you tell him to back off? I'm trying to concentrate. The two of you can't talk to each other? If you got something to say to me, just turn around and say it. Just stop pushing me, okay? You're being such a baby about opening this thing. Maybe if you paid attention to what's been going on, - you'd be worried, too. - Jamie: What do you mean? Or maybe it's that you just don't care anymore. Maybe you just want the whole case for yourself. Maybe you're thinking aboutformaldehyde. That's enough. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Please, the two of you. This is just like you. You get these paranoid fucking delusions about anything that is not under your control. And you're jealous of Jack because he's a successful man. - Whoa. - He's got a big plan. And you got a little tiny plan. And in his case is gonna be full of money. If you just give me one fucking undisturbed moment to open it-- No. Open it. Open the case. Okay. Yes! Oh! Don't touch it. Let's just look at it for a few seconds. That's a million dollars. That is a million dollars. - How much you think is there? - A million fucking dollars. A lot. How many of these do we get? Huh? 10... no 15 each. Thank you, Piece. - It's all there. - Oh, my God, baby. I can't believe it. You stupid bitch. We finally did something. We finally did something. We finally did. - Lay it on me. - Oh, my God. What the fuck is this? We got a lot ofwork to do. Come on, get up! You should let Jamie get on top. 'Cause that's how it was when she was fucking me! Hmm? Sorry. Shoot him! I told you no shooting in the apartment. He's the one shooting. Give me my money. Max! Piece: Why you-- See this? You see this? This is a dead body. That thing before wasn't dead. This is dead. Don't blame this on me. Don't blame you? You poisoned him. Poison was not my idea. We couldn't have shots in our apartment. That was the whole idea. Your apartment! I no longer have anything to do with you, with this place or any of this. This time it's fuck you. This is the end. The end. We have to leave now! What do you want to do with this? Fine. Fuck you, too. - Fine. - Max, leave it. Forget about her. Leave it or go. What do you want to do? Hmm? Let the police take care of it. Let them earn their money. I'll get something. Good. - Is he here for me? - Go back to sleep. Why did you tell him? Why? Why the hell did you do it? I just said it. Do you want to spend the rest of your life with this guy? Make up your mind. Let's go. He's loading Piece's body in the car. Are we gonna do this? Are you gonna help me? All right. Come on. - Pour three martinis. - Three martinis. Three. Jack: Um-um-um. You're a fucking liar. I don't know what about exactly, but I know you are. Why should I trust you? This whole thing between you and Max was set in motion before I ever met you. I don't know if the part I like about you is the real part. I want you to come with me to San Francisco. Why would I lie about that? What do I have to gain? We can introduce ourselves to each other all over again. Two very nice, very rich people that never have to get involved in crime ever again. And then? Then we'll see what happens. Okay. I'm gonna finish packing. Make sure that he gets-- The right one is this one. This one. What about this? Who's share is this gonna come out of? It's her or me, right? Right? Never trust anything that bleeds for five days, and doesn't die, right? Jamie, come on we gotta go. Let's go. Let's have our drinks. A toast. To three very clever people, may we all get what we deserve. I loved you once, Sister Mary Agnes. I loved you, too, Brother Pio. Wait. Max: Stop. ( gagging ) Did you switch glasses? ( cries in pain ) Fuck. We'd better go. What did she mean about switching glasses? I don't know. Dying people say some pretty stupid shit. Huh? Drink up. Let's go. We gotta get out of here. I don't think so. What was this? Getting the money is not enough? Huh? Nothing is enough for people like you? Nothing!? Come on. Come on, you piece of shit. Garbage. You're fucking garbage. And you fucking smell like garbage. - Go on. - That's okay. Get off my money. Jack: Piece of shit. Max: I should have smelled you a mile away. I got played. I got played! I murdered Sister Mary. Why don't you get away from her now? You're not good enough for her. Piece of shit. You killed her. You're gonna walk away with a lot of money for it, aren't you? The money is nice. But it's nothing compared to the Spanish Judges. - You had them? - No, you did. You see that? Made by Jean Baptiste LaRoche in the galleries of the Louvre. It was going to be a present for King Louis the XV of France to King Charles the IV of Spain. What does that say? I can't speak French. But they sure are pretty, aren't they? Circa 1760. Supposedly, these are one of the finest sets of dueling pistols ever made. Personally, I don't like guns. But I do know fine things when I see them. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. The little story I told you about, remember, the gentleman in the motel parking lot? He'd sold the guns by the time we met with him. He sold them on the black market and sold them again and again, For a fraction of their worth. One million dollars. Oh, my God. Hidden this entire time in a graveyard of a fucking apartment. What a joke, Max. How many pretty Sister Mary's you had to kill for a million bucks? Think you know who I am? You haven't even met me yet. Max. Yes? When you showed me the pistols, you only loaded one of them. Do you remember which one it was? No. Well. There's only one way to find out. Shit. That's a 200-year-old gun. I wonder what this gun would do to you? You think it would kill you instantly? Or maybe it would just wound you. Hmm? I could watch you bleed and squirm all night. Like you been doing to Jamie and I. You fuck. You fucking cheap whore. Get down on your knees. Get down on your fucking knees. You beg Jamie to forgive you. Beg her! Mars Girl: Fly. Fly. What's happening? Nothing, honey. Excuse me, Max. Come on. Is he here for me? No, he's not. I got to tell you something. You got to come with me. I can't leave you here. You know too much. As soon as we leave the city, I'll let you go. I'll even give you some money. Go anywhere you want. - Come on. - No, thank you. I have to wait for the man from Mars. I'm the man from Mars. I couldn't tell you before because they would have gotten jealous but I'm that guy. Come with me. You're not, though. 'Cause I've got scars? Everyone's got scars. They know what to do so their scars will heal, but yours keep on getting worse. There's no man from Mars. The only people that are coming are the cops and you can't be here. Tell me you're gonna come with me. No. Please don't make me do something shitty. Okay? Tell me you'll come with me. No. I will do this, I swear. Please. Tell me you'll come with me. ( giggling ) ( cracking sound ) ( police siren wails ) ( knocking on door ) Open up, police! Police! Open the door! ( giggling )
