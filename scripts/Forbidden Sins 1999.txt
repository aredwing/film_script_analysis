Do it up, y'all! Get that money out, people! I wanna see some life! This isn't a funeral parlor! Do it! Oh, hell, yeah. Easy, sir. We wouldn't have to have you thrown out in the Dumpster. People, welcome to the club. There's gonna be no last call tonight. We'll be here until 6:00 in the morning. Then we're going to Sarah's house for a party. Her home number is 21 3-- I wouldn't do that to you. Folks, if you don't get money up on that rail, you'll be stuck with me. These girls will go home. They'll get dressed, and they'll leave. Listen, drinks-- Tequila's three bucks for the next, I don't know, three days. I'm not a manager. I don't care. I'd give 'em to ya for free. Three-dollar shots for the next 45 minutes. Have a good time. Who is this? I told you, I'm sick of your fucking games. Find someone else. Just leave me alone. How the fuck did you get in here? I wouldn't do that if I were you. Put the phone down. You like when they look at you. You like to show off like some cheap street whore. Show me. Show me like you show all them. Do it! Keep going. - What do you want? - I think you know. - Say it. - I can't. Say it. You fucking psycho. And? It's what I like best about you. So, bring me up to speed. Vic's name is Virginia Hill. - She's a stripper. - Who called it in? Another peeler by the name of Molly Malone. Hill didn't show up for work, so Malone comes to see if everything's copacetic. Needless to say-- Screen in the kitchen was slashed. Looks like the same guy who's pulling those home invasions by the airport. Except he never killed anybody. Had to happen sooner or later. Did you fiind any rope laying around? Handcuffs, anything like that? Look at that-- pure Rodeo Drive. If you're a guy who steals things, why leave that? Probably got spooked. Yeah? Then why'd he take the time to untie her? Miss Malone? I'm John Doherty. I'm investigating Virginia Hill's murder. I'm sorry about your friend. Yeah. I still can't believe it. I understand you two worked together, knew each other pretty well. No kidding. We were best friends. So you'd know if there were somebody who'd wanna do something like this. Everybody loved Ginny. - No one at the club gave her trouble? - Nobody. What about boyfriends? I mean, she was sort of seeing David. David? The owner. Were they having any problems? Ginny didn't talk much. But I was starting to get the feeling something weird was going on. All right, look, I shouldn't have said anything. I need this job, and the last thing I want to do is piss off Mr. Mulholland. David Mulholland? Yeah. You don't say. What is it? Life's been good to you, Mulholland. Gonna make that transition all the more diffiicult. Do you mind telling me what this is all about? I understand you and Virginia Hill were friends. That's right. When and where was the last time you saw her? - That's none of your business. -Just answer the question, Mulholland. We were together two nights ago. - And then? - I came home and went to sleep. - Anybody back you up on that? - Yes. Virginia. She'll confiirm when I was there and when I left. I wouldn't count on that, sport. Virginia was murdered in her home the night before last. That can't be. That's pretty good. - I almost believe you. - I had no reason to hurt Virginia. Just like you had no reason to hurt Teresa Seketrian? I barely knew Teresa. Yeah, well, her roommate says different, and for some reason I believe her. You fucked up this time, Davey. You left the body. - Get the fuck out of my home. - Oh, no. You get the fuck out. Search warrant, Davey. Well, well, well. Look what I found in your fiireplace. - Cut yourself shaving? - You know damn well that's not mine. Yeah. Yeah. You're probably right. I bet this blood belongs to Virginia Hill. You would know the answer to that. Cuff him. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you. Do you understand these rights? Very well. Bail is set at $500,000. Court is adjourned. It's a setup, Harvey. I wish I could see you through this one, but I'm not a trial lawyer. I do know one, though. - Who is he? - It's a she. Absolutely top-drawer. Very effective with juries. She's on her own and she's very selective about the cases she takes on. But you got one big advantage. What's that? She feels the same way about Detective Doherty. She's dealt with him before? Yeah. She was married to him. Elliot Greenblatt on two. Elliot. Sixteen hours, no charges. Yeah. Admit it, Elliot. You've got bubkes. How can a Greenblatt not know what bubkes means? Listen, Elliot, I'm sitting here with a motion for habeas corpus. Now, if you were a mensch-- which means nice guy-- you'd release my client and save me the cost of a messenger. Thank you, Elliot. All right. Lunch is on me. Bye. Lost. Yagher painted that in '43... just after he was expelled by the Nazis. Very impressive. Mr. Mulholland. Well, not as impressive as your reputation, Ms. Doherty. - I'm glad you'll be handling my case. - I haven't offiicially agreed yet. Brian, do you have a moment? Mr. Mulholland, this is Brian Armstrong. If we do decide to take your case, Brian does all my investigative work. I'm gonna be blunt, Mr. Mulholland. I am bothered that you were involved with a girl who worked at your club. It may seem like you're using your position to exploit her. I'm a businessman, Ms. Doherty. I own grocery stores, pharmacies. I even own a new age bookstore. Do you date the girls that work in those establishments too? Not the bookstore. I'm single. I enjoy the company of women... particularly beautiful women. But it's important that you understand... I had nothing to do with Virginia Hill's death. My job is to provide my client with the best possible defense. My personal opinions are irrelevant. Well, it's relevant to me. I'm not looking for a Johnnie Cochran to get me off with smoke and mirrors. I need my attorney to believe in my innocence. If you're unable to do so... we're wasting each other's time. Is your full name David Philip Mulholland? Yes. Were you involved in a sexual relationship with Virginia Hill? - What's your gut on this guy? - I don't know. I wouldn't want my daughter dating him. I like that he wants us to believe he's innocent so badly. So does every inmate on death row. There's a lot of evidence against him. Yeah. Yeah, the evidence. Are you responsible for the death of Virginia Hill? No. Hello,John. Been drinking? You fiight better when you're drunk. I don't drink anymore, and I'm not here to fiight. - I'm here to talk some sense into you. - You don't have the credentials. Cute. Is this a vendetta, Maureen? Are you taking this case to get back at me? You know better, as much as I'd like to. And in case you're interested, Mulholland aced the polygraph. He beat the polygraph. He killed her... just as sure as he killed Teresa. John, I know you loved your niece. We both did. But you weren't objective. You picked Mulholland as the killer and you never looked back. Did you know that... she told her roommate... that he liked to tie her up and hurt her? Hearsay, Your Honor, which you would know if you had stuck it out. The problem is, I don't like lawyers. Which is why you would've made a good one. Instead you became a bent cop. Objection, Counselor. They never proved that I planted that evidence. Well, we both know better. Don't we,John? Yeah, well, a wife can't testify against her husband. - Ex-wife. - Ah. Must be why I stopped drinking. Fuck you,John. If I so much as hear the DA whisper Teresa's name in that courtroom... I'll have Mulholland out on a mistrial faster than your head can spin. You better pray you don't get him off... because he will kill again... and the blood will be on your hands. Unfortunately, the cops didn't do their job, so you're going to have to. I want you to thoroughly investigate Virginia Hill. Go back to public school if you have to. - I want-- - The dirt. And I'm sure there's a sandboxful. Check with the girls she worked with. I love my work. Also, check the pawn shops. My client gave her some jewelry that's missing. I'll start at the club. I never know what to tip at these places. Five at the bar, twenty for a private. You think I never went to Chippendale's? Get outta here. I really don't see why this is necessary. It may trigger a memory. You know, something that could help us. So, you arrived before Virginia. How'd you get in? She left a key under the mat. And where were you when she arrived? The bedroom. She liked to pretend that I'd break in to rape her. They were just kinky games. Except... Except what? That last night she wanted something more. -Had you ever done that with her before? -No, not like that. With anyone else? No. It was Virginia's idea. I know this looks bad. But you asked me what happened. I'm no Boy Scout, but I never did anything she didn't ask me to... and I certainly never hurt her. She was alive when I left here. I believe you. I wanna bring out one of my favorites ever since I was a young dumb-ass. This is Molly Malone. Clap your hands, y'all. Do it up. Do it! Do it! Yeah! Go. Get that money out, people. - Bet I know what you're thinkin'. - What's that? If my moist... juicy... pink... mouth... - tastes as good as it looks. - Not bad. I bet I know what you're thinking. What's that? He's gonna have to pay to fiind out. Hey! Asshole! No touching. House rules. Never stopped him before. Who is he? Billy Peterson. Mr. Hot-Shit Manager. I wouldn't mind managing you. Yeah, I can tell. As a matter of fact... I think that was worth a little extra. - I'm liking you more and more. - Can I buy you a drink? Sure. And a BMW, while you're at it. I'm surprised to see that guy walking around free. I heard he was arrested for murdering some girl. You're thinking of David Mulholland, the owner. So you knew the girl that was killed? Ginny. Yeah. She was like a sister to me. I'm sorry. You really think that Mulholland guy did it? - Look, I gotta go. - Wait. Can I see you later? Make it up to you? We can just talk. Whatever you want. Checked all the pawn shops... but there's no trace of Virginia's jewelry anywhere. - So far. - So far. Now for the bad news. I spoke to a friend of mine over at the DA's offiice. She claims they have a woman who lives next door to Virginia. She saw... a man matching Mulholland's description trying to dispose of something. Can she positively I.D. him? That's what my contact says. No physical evidence. Just her statement. Other than that, the only lead I've got... and it's not much, is a woman who used to work with Virginia-- Molly Malone. - She's the one who discovered the body? - Yeah. Spoke to her the other night. There's something she's not talking about. Whatever it is, it scares her. Okay, well, stay on her, Brian. Do whatever you have to do. Have you seen this? Son of a bitch. You knew about this the whole time? - Calm down. - Not a chance. Four home invasion robberies in eight months, all single women living alone... and each time the burglar gained access to the home by slashing the screens. Except this guy didn't kill Virginia Hill. Do you make any effort at all to establish a link between crimes? I didn't have to. There were inconsistencies. Besides, it's been in all the papers. Mulholland could've easily staged the murder scene to fiit the M.O. That's it,John. You sat on a lead. I'm not gonna let you railroad my client. When I get through with you on the stand... there's not gonna be enough of you left to pin a Purple Heart on. The defense would like a continuance, Your Honor. There have been a rash of crimes committed in the last eight months... that bear distinct resemblance to the murder of Virginia Hill... so we believe it's completely relevant. We also believe information has been intentionally withheld by the police. That's a pretty serious allegation, Counselor. Mr. Booth? It's the fiirst I'm hearing about it, Your Honor. I didn't want to bring this up... but the detective in question and Ms. Doherty... have recently gone through a rather bitter divorce. For Pete's sake, Fred-- Now wait. I will not have my courtroom used as a personal battlefiield. I'll give you one extra week. This trial will begin in two weeks. And one more thing: Due to the nature of this trial... cameras and spectators are barred from my courtroom. Thank you, Your Honor. So, how did you feel, sir, when you learned of the death of Virginia Hill? I was devastated. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I-- Okay, don't look at me. Remember, the jury's over there. Eye contact with them is important. - This seems a little premeditated. - Well, that may be. But they're gonna haul out her mother, who will outperform Shirley Maclaine... so that jury better believe you. Why can't we tell them the truth? Why can't I walk into that courtroom and tell them what happened? You can. What is the truth, David? The truth is, I didn't feel much of anything. And? And it scared me. You're on trial for murder, not for being an uncaring lover. You're not actually putting me on the stand, are you? I might have to. The circumstantial evidence is very compelling. Unless they fiind that home invasion guy. It's past midnight. We worked through dinner, huh? Why don't I just check my machine... and we'll grab a bite? No, I think I'll just warm up some pizza or something. Oh, come on. Where's the kitchen? You'll be tragically disappointed if you think you'll fiind food in there. I'll be the judge of that. Where is it? Right? Left? - Right. - Right. Can you turn water into wine too? Nope.Just mushroom soup into turkey tetrazzini. - Where'd you learn how to cook? - My ex-wife. Speaking of which... it seems like she's vanished off the face of the planet. Oh, I told you. She remarried and moved to Europe. I haven't spoken to her in over six years. Why did you two split up? Oh, we just drifted apart. - You know how it is. - Yeah. The thing I don't get is... how a terrifiic woman like you ended up marrying a guy like Doherty. We were both in law school. That guy was in law school? Yeah. His parents forced him into it. He wanted to be a cop like his dad. - Was his dad crooked? - He wrote the book on it. Actually, you know, John was determined to be different. And he was for a while. He just got frustrated when the bad guys walked, I guess. Yeah, so he stacks the deck. I got out before things got really bad. Does he still resent you for leaving? I don't know. He's probably pretty relieved that I'm gone. Anybody that would let you go is a fool. He surrendered after holding her hostage for 3 hours. His name is Robert Nunn. - Same M.O.? - Right down to the cut screen. But the DA is gonna allow him to cop a plea for breaking and entering. They got him for kidnapping, minimum. But he's on his third strike. If they take a B&E, he's up for life. Of course. Then there's no worry about anything damaging the case against Mulholland. I'm gonna get a sit-down with Nunn. You stay with Malone. I wanna fiind out what's she's hiding. I'm on it, boss. - I was hoping you'd stop by. - Why's that? Had a meeting with my astrologer. Said I was gonna meet the love of my life. Sounded a lot like you. There's only one way to fiind out. What time do you get off work tonight? Mr. Nunn, my name's Maureen Doherty. - I'd like to ask you a few questions. - About what? I'm an attorney representing a man charged in the murder of Virginia Hill. Never heard of her. Here's a picture. Nice tits. Virginia was killed under circumstances... that bear more than a passing resemblance to your patterns. ``Patterns''? You can't possibly expect my client to confess to a murder. Her windows were slashed, and a lot of jewelry was taken. You have quite an affection for jewelry. If you say another word, Mr. Nunn, I will not be held responsible. I don't know what you're talking about. You were caught red-handed. You're on a third strike for mandatory life. You sure there's nothing you want to talk to me about? I didn't kill nobody. This interview is over. One more word from you, and I will have you up on disciplinary charges. You wanna be my lawyer? This guy's a fuckin' moron. That's me at seven. Daddy's little girl. Cute. Okay, you can't see this one. - What? - It's my graduation picture. No way! Give it here. God! I can see why you'd wanna keep that hidden. You were a late bloomer, huh? Here. Oh. Who's this? That's Ginny. She's the girl who was killed. You miss her a lot? Yeah. We had some great times. At least, before David. What do you mean? Well, see... David and I... used to see each other. Then he got hot for Ginny, she and I got in a big fiight. I mean, we made up... but it was never the same. I'm glad you're not with him anymore. - The paper said he was into weird shit. - Not with me. He was always a real gentleman. Just like you. Then why was Virginia so scared of him? Why are you always asking me questions about them? I don't know. I've never been out with anyone before whose friend got killed. The whole thing is intriguing. You want something intriguing? Don't mind if I do. Mulholland must be crazy. I'd never choose Virginia over you. I'm sorry. Oh, it's not you. It's just that there's something about that night that I haven't told anyone. Tell me. I'm scared. Molly... you can trust me. The night that Ginny was killed she called me. There was someone with her, but it was Dav-- This is Molly. I'm just sitting here. That is none of your business. What? What was it that you said you did for a living? Who was that, Molly? You're working for Mulholland, aren't you? - He sent you here to spy on me? - Who was that? I trusted you! You prick! Get out! Molly, I don't know who you're protecting... but don't you fucking lie when you get on that witness stand! I said, get the fuck out! The State calls as its fiirst witness Mr. William Peterson. Mr. Peterson, you are the manager... of a strip club called Night Moves. - Are you not? - That's right. Mr. Peterson, on the night of February 21 ... did you observe anything unusual about Virginia Hill? Yes. She had a bruise on her neck. - Did you ask her about it? - Yeah, I asked her. - She said Mulholland had done it. - Is that right? - Anything else? - Yes. I remember she specifiically said that she was scared of Mr. Mulholland... and she was worried that he'd lose it someday and end up killing her. - Objection. Hearsay. - Overruled. I'm going to allow it, but let's move on, Mr. Booth. Your Honor, I have no further questions. Mr. Peterson. How would you describe your relationship with the girls at the club? We get along okay. -Do you often get a little too friendly? -That's bull. Everything was always professional. Completely professional. ``Professional.'' Is that how you would characterize your relationship with Virginia Hill? Exactly. Nothing personal. Don't you fiind it strange then that she would choose to share with you... the details of her relationship with Mr. Mulholland? Objection, Your Honor. Calls for speculation. Sustained. Withdraw the question. Isn't it also true, Mr. Peterson, that shortly before Virginia Hill's murder... my client threatened to remove you from your job? He might have. Didn't one of the women at the club... come to Mr. Mulholland complaining about you making advances... and threatening to sue for sexual harassment? I never made any advances on her. I am a happy married man. Yes or no, Mr. Peterson. Did one of your employees come to Mr. Mulholland... complaining about you making sexual advances? Yes. But she was a lying bitch. No further questions. Wow. Are you Mulholland's lawyer? Yes, speaking. Ma'am, are you all right? Is there something you wanted to tell me? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called. - Don't hang up. - Why would I hang up? Did you get the painting? Yes, it's-- Well, it's spectacular. -And I can't accept it. - I'll tell you what. Don't charge me for this phone call, and we'll call it even. It's way too extravagant, David. Well, extravagance is relative. I just wanted to show you how much I appreciate what you're doing. Well, you know, I am being paid for what I'm doing. Yeah, but you can't pay someone to believe in you. - But there is a catch. - Oh, yes, I thought so. What is it? When we win... I take you to dinner. You know what? Let's win fiirst. - Then we'll talk about it. Okay? - Okay. - I'll see you in the morning. - Thank you. Ginny said that she needed to spend some time alone... and that she would call me later. Then she left. That's the last time I ever saw her alive. Your witness. On the night that Virginia Hill died, did she call you on the telephone? Do you realize you're still under oath? She didn't call me. If it's found you've perjured yourself, you'll face criminal charges. Objection. Defense is unnecessarily badgering the witness. Sustained. You had a sexual relationship with Mr. Mulholland, didn't you? Yes. Did Mr. Mulholland ever harm you in any way? No. Did he ever ask you if he could tie you up... or did he tie you up? Never. Thank you. No more questions. Hi. Come on in. What you got? Roger Nunn's rap sheet. The DA fiinally got around to sending it over. Don't bother. Nunn was in jail the night Virginia Hill was killed. He was picked up on March 1 2 on a bench warrant... for an outstanding speeding ticket... where he stayed until he fiinally made bail on the 20th. Damn. Hey. Don't you quit on me now. I need you. We're gonna win this thing. You'll see. - Mrs. Doherty? - Yes? I phoned you the other night. Yes. Hi. Of course. I was afraid you wouldn't call back. I have some information. I don't know what to do. Listen, why don't we meet-- I can't do this. I-- I'm sorry, I just can't. No, wait, don't-- Mrs. Peterson, I'm Maureen Doherty. I think you called me. Is there something you wanted to talk about? You have the wrong person. I don't know what you're talking about. Look, I know it was you. Claire! Who the hell is it? It's-- It's just Girl Scouts selling cookies. Tell 'em to get the fuck outta here! Make me some breakfast. It was a mistake. I can't talk to you. Please go. Look, wait, if you change your mind, here's my card. - Please, it's imp-- - Claire! It's important. So, one of the forensic guys called me over to the fiireplace. - This what he showed you? - It is. Please describe it to the court. It's a piece of light blue fabric with blood... that we've confiirmed belongs to the victim, Virginia Hill. Your witness. Detective Doherty, did you know Mr. Mulholland prior to this case? - I did. - Did you have a low opinion of him? Yes, and for a good reason. I wasn't asking for your reasons, Detective. Merely trying to establish that you had a preformed opinion of the man. You claimed you were never alone in Mr. Mulholland's residence, correct? That's right. And on the day in question, did you arrive prior to the other offiicers? It's possible. Was Mr. Mulholland out by the pool at that time? I wouldn't know. His maid told me to wait in the foyer while she got him. Well, now I'm confused, Detective... because you said you were never alone at the house. Isn't that right? - I was alone for a couple seconds. - Uh-huh. Long enough to plant evidence, Detective? Your Honor, may we have a side bar? Approach. Your Honor, Counsel is attempting to impugn solid evidence... with unsubstantiated innuendo... to discredit an outstanding offiicer. It's disgraceful. Your Honor, if you allow me to pursue the current line of questioning... it will become apparent the veracity of the evidence is doubtful at best. I'm going to allow it, but you're on a very short leash, Ms. Doherty. Thank you, Your Honor. Now, Detective Doherty, have you ever been accused... of falsifying or planting evidence? I was cleared. Isn't it true... that the charges were dropped as a result of a plea bargain? Your Honor, I strongly object. Detective Doherty is not on trial here. Maybe he should be. Strike that last statement from the record. Counselor, another remark like that and I'll cite you with contempt. I'm sorry, Your Honor. Detective Doherty, are you aware... that Mr. Mulholland's maid stated in her affiidavit... that she cleaned the fiireplace... a day before you arrived with your search warrant? Yes. Then isn't it true... that you found the evidence at Virginia Hill's home... and later planted it at the home of Mr. Mulholland? That is absolutely not true. I thought this wasn't personal. I warned you if you started playing games with me, I would crucify you. You know damn well I told you about that plea bargain as a husband to his wife. You crossed the line, Maureen. Oh, I'm surprised you even know where the line is. I thought you were better than me. Hey, it's me. You rushed off today. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I had some things to take care of. Well, let me take you to dinner. Well, thanks, but it's late, and by the time you get here-- Open the door. Sorry. What? Just hang up your phone and open the door. Okay. Come on in. I thought you might need a little cheering up. That's very sweet. Thank you. Can I interest you in a very, very dry martini? Oh, yes. By ``very, very dry'' do you mean just opening the vermouth bottle... and just waving it over the gin? I was thinking of pouring a few drops of vermouth in the humidifiier... and setting it on low. That sounds even better. Was I that obvious? Not really. I don't even think the DA noticed. Well, Fred Booth has the sensitivity of seedless grapes. Yes. - There you go. - Cheers. Excellent. I guess I did let my emotions rule the day today. Maureen, you were married to the guy. You're gonna have a residue of emotions, good or bad. Yeah, I guess you're right. Do you play? Enough to be critically panned. Me too. Oh, you use the pedal. That's good. Not bad. Thank you. I'm sorry. I don't think we should mix emotions and martinis today. You'd better go, David. All right. The People call Celeste Paige. I object, Your Honor. This witness is not on the roster, and we've had no time to prepare. Miss Paige was included in our discovery material, however... we were unaware of her whereabouts until she contacted us yesterday afternoon. - You're sure her testimony is relevant? - Absolutely. Your Honor, I must object. We've had no time to prepare for this witness. Overruled, Ms. Doherty. How long were you married to the defendant, Miss Paige? Three years. And could you give us a brief overview of those three years? Well, in the beginning it was wonderful. David was-- or seemed to be-- the perfect man. But eventually-- eventually I realized he was masking something. Masking what, exactly? Well, he started bringing home this smut-- women bound and gagged. It was disgusting. Their breasts and vaginas pierced. He asked me if I would let him tie me up. I agreed to try it, but soon that's all he wanted to do. What happened then? He became violent. He would hurt me... and he'd get this look in his eyes. What kind of look? I can't even describe it. It was deranged, crazy. And I knew if I didn't get out of there something terrible was going to happen. I am sorry we had to make you relive such an awful experience, Miss Paige. Your witness. Ms. Paige, do you feel vindictive toward your ex-husband? It's hard not to feel vindictive toward someone who abuses you. Was he ever, say, late on alimony? I didn't ask for alimony. I didn't want him to know where I was. I didn't want him anywhere near me. No more questions. Look, you said it yourself. She's vindictive. She didn't sound vindictive to me. She sounded injured. Virginia didn't ask you to tie her up. It was the other way around. - It's not true. - Don't lie to me, David. You know I haven't lied to you. Anyone can beat a polygraph, David. All it takes is lack of conscience. Look, Maureen. Celeste has ulterior motives. Please, David. I haven't candy-coated the truth, no matter how bad it makes me look. I need you on my side. I'm your defense attorney. I have to be on your side. I want more than that. I hope you're this convincing on the stand, David... because after today's testimony, that's the only chance we've got. You shouldn't leave your door unlocked. There's a lot of maniacs running around. And one of them is standing right in front of me. That's not a very nice thing to say to someone's who's trying to help you. Oh, yeah. Right. So what was so important you had to see me? I'm scared. - I want out. - You want out? That sick fuck tortured and murdered your friend. You want him to get away with that? Is that what you want? You know that's not what I want. But what if they fiind out? The only way they will fiind out is if you tell them. Just keep your mouth shut and you'll be home free. Look, Molly... why don't you get lost for a couple of weeks? Go to Hawaii till this thing blows over. Yeah, I'll just go to the bank and take out a loan. Well, how much do you charge your clientele? I don't do that anymore... thanks to you. That's too bad. I was thinking of making a contribution... to the Molly Malone Deserves a Trip to Hawaii Fund. How does that sound? How much were you going to give? Oh, no. I don't do that. No, you forget, honey... I know everything you do. It was nearly 2:00 a.m. when I left. I drove straight home and went to bed. Mr. Mulholland, are you responsible for the death of Virginia Hill? No. Absolutely not. Thank you. No further questions. Your witness, Mr. Booth. Now, Mr. Mulholland, do you frequent adult book stores? Well, I've been known to visit them on occasion, certainly. And have you made purchases there? On occasion. Sadomasochistic material? - It's possible. - Now, what if I told you... that a cashier at one of these establishments... claims that you purchase exclusively sadomasochistic material? Objection. Your Honor, there's been no mention... of this alleged cashier in any other testimony. Your Honor, he will appear on redirect. If he does appear on redirect then the testimony will stand. Otherwise it will be stricken from the record. By then the damage will already have been done, Your Honor. I said ``overruled,'' Ms. Doherty. Answer the question, Mr. Mulholland. Would this cashier be lying if he says that you have... an exclusive interest in sadomasochistic material? - Yes, he would. - And other customers-- would they be lying too? Yes. Drink up. I never should have put him on the stand. Well, you didn't have a choice. His ex-wife's testimony skewered you. This isn't good, Bri. It is not good. It's just not an option. As it stands, I can't see the jury not coming back with a guilty verdict. You could go to the gas chamber. At least consider a plea bargain. No. I won't admit to a crime I didn't do. I have nothing to fiight them with. How about the truth? You have to fiind out where they're hiding it. Going somewhere? Ms. Malone, I'll remind you that you're still under oath. Ms. Malone, you stated that the last time you spoke with Virginia Hill... was on the night she died, at the club-- is that true? She called me that night, at about 2:00 in the morning. And what did she say? She wanted to know if I would work a shift for her at the club. Is there anything else about the phone call you remember? I heard Ginny talking to someone-- to a guy. And was that guy Mr. Mulholland? I don't think so. Why don't you think so? Because I heard him ask her if she was talking to Mulholland... and she said no, she was talking to me. Did you tell this to the police? - Yes, I did. - And who did you talk to there? To Detective Doherty. I told him, and he said that I must be mistaken. I told him that I wasn't. Then he said that I didn't give a shit about Ginny... because I was just helping her killer. And did Mr. Doherty say who he thought the killer was? Yeah. He said that David Mulholland killed her and that he had proof. So you lied under oath... because Detective Doherty told you Mulholland was the killer. I just lied because I was afraid. Afraid of what? A couple of years ago I skipped bail in Texas. And when Doherty was questioning me he had an arrest warrant... with my name on it conveniently sitting on his desk. So you believed Detective Doherty... one of our illustrious LAPD... would arrest you if you didn't lie? Yes. That is exactly what I believed. Thank you, Miss Malone. No more questions. Your witness. Miss Malone, did you not tell Detective Doherty that you had been... drinking quite heavily that evening? I told him that I had some champagne. I believe you told Detective Doherty that you had eight glasses. So it would be fair to say that you were inebriated? - I know what I heard. - Is that right? You had eight drinks-- eight drinks-- and you claim to know what you heard? Objection, Your Honor. Badgering the witness. Sustained. Caution, Mr. Booth. Miss Malone, did Detective Doherty... actually threaten you with arrest? - No, but he had the-- - Yes or no? And he didn't ask you to lie either, did he? All he suggested was that you be absolutely sure... the testimony you gave was the truth... and not some drunken recollection. Your Honor, now he's testifying for the witness. Sustained. Withdrawn. No further questions. Court is adjourned until 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. I came as soon as you called. God forgive me. Oh, that's great. Thank you, Claire. So, Mrs. Peterson, what did you fiind when going through your husbands things? A check written to Virginia Hill for $5,000. Is this the check? Yes. Did you ask your husband about it? Yes, I did. Well, at fiirst he said... he'd borrowed some money from Virginia and he'd repaid her. But then eventually he admitted she'd caught him skimming from the club. That's a goddamned lie! You're dead! Bailiff, remove that man from this courtroom. You're dead, Claire. Don't you come home. You may proceed, Ms. Doherty. So, Virginia Hill was blackmailing your husband-- is that right? He said she was sleeping with the boss... and it would be very easy to get him fiired, maybe even prosecuted. -And they settled the matter for $5,000? -No. Two days before she was killed... he said she asked for more. On the night Virginia Hill was murdered... what time did your husband arrive home? He was late. It was already starting to get light out. Mr. Peterson, where were you the night Virginia Hill was murdered? I was at the club doing the books. Was there anyone there to see you do the books? - No. - Isn't it true that at 2:00 a.m... you went to visit Virginia Hill to make yet another payment? I never made no payment in the fiirst place. Is this your signature on the check? Someone could have forged that. And is this Virginia's signature on the back? Someone forged that too? You don't like Mr. Mulholland very much, do you, Mr. Peterson? No, I don't. So you waited until just after he left the club to kill Virginia... knowing he would be the prime suspect. Your Honor, she's putting words in the witness' mouth. He's already denied these outrageous charges. - Sustained. - You haven't told us... everything about your relationship with Virginia Hill, have you? I told you everything. You also told us that you were a happily married man. I was. Then why would your wife sacrifiice her very happy marriage... to come and testify for us today? Maybe she's fucking Mulholland. Are you angry enough to kill right now, Mr. Peterson? Your Honor, I cannot sit back and allow this line of questioning. No more questions. Your witness, Mr. Booth. - Cheers. - Cheers. You know, I thought Booth was gonna pop an artery... when Molly testifiied about your ex. Oh, and speaking of which, the word is... Doherty was suspended today. Well, I guess it's just as well. I better run. It's a school night. - I'll walk you out. - All right. - Nice job. - Thanks. Thank you. - Am I too late? - Well, you missed some champagne. You don't think all this is a little premature, do you? No. The case is blown to hell. They'll never get a conviction now. Well, I promised you a victory dinner. And I said we'll see. - I'm pretty sure everything's closed. - Oh, I anticipated that. Food, drink, ambiance. Wow. Very smooth. Let's give it a shot. So you really think that Peterson did it? Means, motive, opportunity. I owe you so much. You don't owe me. I did what you paid me to do. Well, I'd like to believe that it was a little more than that. I don't think this is such a good idea. You're probably right. Nice day for it. - You got keys? - You'll have to take me with you. I would, but I don't think the judge would appreciate it as much as I would. I'll see you in court, Counselor. I know. You forgot-- John. What are you doing here? I came by to see if you're okay. Of course I'm okay. Why? Peterson's flown the coop. His wife said that he threatened to kill you and her both. Well, from what I understand,John, that's no longer a concern of yours. Yeah, thanks to you. Nice to see you,John. Don't let the door hit you-- Wait, Maureen. Please. Two minutes? For old times' sake? All right. Come in. I can't believe you still have this thing. God, we bought that on our fiirst anniversary. That stupid canoe trip we took. You remember, I got totally lost? You gave me so much shit. Said only a genius could get lost on a one-way river with no turns. - You remember that, Mo? - I remember. Yeah, well, guess what. It's not that hard after all. John, sometimes you just have to get the hell out of the water and walk back. - But I was so sure. - That doesn't make any difference. Even if you were right... what you did turned you into the thing you hated most. So you hate me, Mo? Is that it? I don't hate you John. I never hated you. It's just that you stopped being a man I respected. Oh, that's great. Okay, here in one hour. All right. Bye. All right, well, I guess I'll let you get back to-- to whatever it was you were doing. One thing before you go. Did you plant that evidence at David's house? Like I said, I was so sure. So, what do you want? All charges dropped with prejudice. I can't do it. The press'll crucify me. Without prejudice, your guy walks. Only until you guys manufacture new evidence. With prejudice or no deal. It's no deal then. Who you trying to kid, Fred? You know you've got an election coming up in November. - How did you know he'd fold? - Oh, I didn't. It was a complete bluff, I swear. Oh, thank God for good deodorant. Did you call Mulholland with the good news? I thought I'd like to deliver this news in person. John, it's Maureen. Could you please call me as soon as you get this message? So help me, God, I really think I screwed up this time. Please call me back as soon as you can. Thanks. - Why'd you drive off so quickly? - Why do you think? Maureen, I can explain that. Mrs. Peterson came to me because her husband threatened to kill her. She needed some money till he was caught. How do I know you didn't pay her to forge that check? Did you seduce her, too, David? You used to believe me. Well, I might again, as soon as I take that check to an expert. And if it's forged, I will personally make sure that the case is reopened. Do you hear me? Please, Maureen. I don't want to lose you. I need to convince you I am telling you the truth. - I'm coming over to explain. - No. I do not want you here, David. David! Shit. You don't want to do this, Maureen. Get out of my way, David. I need that check. Open the door, Maureen. Open the door! It's the last thing in the world I wanted to do, Maureen. Just give me the check. - Are you okay, honey? - That stupid bitch. She's just like the other two. Oh, my God. So this was all planned from the beginning? Molly's changing testimony, Claire's new evidence-- all planned? And I should get an Academy Award for pretending to believe that drivel... that your buddy Armstrong was dishing out. I practically had to send him a telegram to catch me with your ex. Yeah, honey, but we couldn't have done it without you, Maureen. I mean, your sincere belief in my innocence-- that put them over the top. Don't believe him, Molly. He's just using you. And when he's fiinished with you, you'll end up like all the rest. - You're wrong. We love each other. - What about Virginia? He never loved her. She tried to break us up with her lies. And she got what she deserved. -Just like you're gonna get. - Girls, please. Can't we all get along? No, I-- I wanna watch you die. You look a little scared, baby. David, they're gonna know it's you. No-- Peterson. See, Peterson threatened to kill you. At least, that's what I paid Mrs. Peterson to say. Keep your eyes open. Come on, keep your eyes open. - Hi,John. - What's up, Davey? What are you going to do,John? What I should have done a long time ago. No,John. I'm not gonna let him kill again. Don't do it,John. []:skywalkerxp []:skywalkerxp []:English
