But no matter how wonderful this is, I will not accept it as a trade-off for losing you. I've got you. Thank you ever so for your kind assistance. Always anxious to lend a hand to a Dominar. So often I've proclaimed having a belly full of Crichton and Aeryn. Never thought it would be so literal. What did you call their species again? This is Crichton. He is called a Human. And Aeryn, Sebacean. Definitely Sebacean. Rygel, do you have all the pieces? From under every rock, every crevice, I sifted the bottom sand with my bare hands! Look at my nails! Caa'ta, the Leviathan ship has returned. Their transport pod is approaching. Order the concealment canopy lowered. Sir, another deep-space contact from Peacekeeper Strategic Command. It's Grand Chancellor Maryk again. Grand Chancellor. Where the Hedsmana in my orders did you find the phrase "preemptive attack"? The Scarrans are massing for an impending onslaught we all know is coming! A conflict we are ill situated to win. By challenging them before they are prepared, we have a fighting chance. - You were sent to gather surveillance and... - With all due respect, sir, I was sent here to perish at the vanguard of this inevitable conflict. I simply refuse to participate on their terms or yours! Because of your actions, the Scarran Empire has declared war against us. Do you know what that means, Scorpius? We are now officially engaged in the last war of our era! Congratulations. - D'Argo! - Chiana! - Your eyes. - I can see again. - What happened? How? - He, He gave me n-new eyes. - We found one, yes. - Stark and I found a Diagnosan. What's wrong with him? Nothing's wrong with him! He's fine. Grunschlk, I thought you were dead. Me? Hardly at all. Those crystals are people's lives. Stop waving that thing around. This had better work. You're lucky to have him, mate. Diagnosans, they're at a premium. Especially now that there's a war on. What war? The Peacekeepers and the Scarrans have declared war against each other. Do the Peacekeepers know what they're getting into? The Scarrans didn't give 'em much choice. They were already taking the galaxy by force. System by system. A galaxy-wide war. The Scarran vanguard has breached our defense perimeter. We've drawn them in sufficiently. The trap is set. Captain, initiate the plan exactly as I instructed. All pilots, deactivate targeting in-flight systems. We fly manual from here. Fly straight in. Their targeting telemetrics will be corrupted at least two degrees off center by the ambient magnetics. You dared them to hit you. Red Team, move close to my left flank. Blue Team, likewise. Upon signal, execute tier attack on lead Scarran Dreadnought. Confirm. All armada ships now taking heavy fire, sir. Only for the moment. Stay positioned. And... fire! Lower your weapons. How long? About 60 solar days. Where? Still on the water planet. Put your weapons down now! Bad guys? Yes and no. They did help us put you back together. Put us back together? They said it was an accident. You were crystallized. Crystallized? Last warning. - You said yes. - I did? - Sixty days. Any regrets? - No. It's going really well. Hey, we're gonna get married! Congratulations. Sir, you were absolutely correct. Their pilots and gunners were no match for ours. - Scorpius? - Prepare to withdraw. What? The rest of the armada is to continue to engage the enemy, covering our escape. But, sir, we're winning. - Without this carrier, all remaining units... - My orders are clear. Sir, you're asking us to withdraw our troops, our ships, our... Close hangars! Wait for maximum speed. He is alive, Sikozu. John Crichton is alive. One more time. Begin again. Fine. For the 89th time. Once upon a time, there was a boy named John. And John was an astronaut. He lived in a faraway place called Earth. Which is so far away, you've never heard of it. One day when John was out doing astronaut things, a big blue wormhole gobbled him up and spat him out at the far end of the universe. - Things were looking grim in Mudville - Canaveral? Till our hero met an amazing living ship, made some nice new friends and he hooked up with his dream girl. We could've lived happily ever after, but the Peacekeepers raped, chased and tortured us for years on end. Fire! Then two months ago, we got our asses shot off again. This time it was the Scarrans, big reptiles. Oooh! And Moya, our living ship, limped her way to your happy planet for a little R&R. Because we figure, it's empty! Hey, no one is gonna bother us. We're gonna have a baby! - Will you marry me? - Yes. Next thing, me and the future Mrs. Crichton are having a private moment when you guys fly by. Boom bada-bing, squiggly line, squiggly line. Crystallized. And it's two months later. What? Retreating. Scorpius has powered off his onboard beacon. We have no way of tracking him. Broadcast this order. Highest priority. The instant his command carrier is spotted, it is to be fired upon. No hailing, no offer to surrender. I want this coward Scorpius and all who fly with him erased from existence! Aye, Chancellor. Scorpius is many things, Maryk. None of them good. But a coward? Never. He has initiated this war, and then turned and run! How do you define cowardice, Grayza? Grand Chancellor, please consider my counsel on this carefully. Hatred of the Scarrans is Scorpius' sole consistent trait. There is something else. Perhaps. But my orders stand. - Funny how? - Different. Different how? Like ice cream cucumber different? I don't know. That's why I'm here. All right. Everything is gonna be okay. Do you know why? Because we're done. We're checking out. Next Ferengi we see, we run. No questions later. From this moment on, my one concern, my life is you and our baby. Are you sure? - What? - Is she all right? The baby all right? Doc says he doesn't know what you're talking about. There is no baby. What? Whoa, whoa! What do you mean, no baby? Ah, if there was a little passenger before, it ain't aboard the train no more. Doc says you never were pregnant. - I was. - She was! She was preg... You were pregnant? I was pregnant! There is no baby. No. Nothing. Whoa! We were in pieces, thousands of pieces. Rygel said he got every single piece off of the ocean floor. - Rygel. - He was very thorough. We made sure of it. Even carried the pieces up in his stomach to make sure he didn't drop them. Congratulations, mate. You are a mother! - Oh, no! - It's all right. The wee babe is doing just fine. Yes, but it's doing just fine inside me! This is not happening. - Do something. - Hands off, missy. The fee. The fee is going up. You take it out of him, and you put it back in her. Whatever it takes. Won't do it. Won't? I want this thing removed immediately. It's not a thing! Fine. I want this miracle of life out of me! All right. At the end of the first quadmester. The baby's too small now. Fragile. First quadmester? Give me a drink! Hey, princess, the nar's in your stomach? Drad. - What does it feel like? - You tell me. Hey! Weeber eggs? I hate them. Well, apparently babies love them. Actually, Rygel, what does it really feel like? Like having a parasite, a large parasite that's growing! Okay, what did we do to piss off the locals? - They're paranoid. - No, wrong, not paranoid. I've been talking to many of them. Stark our ambassador? No wonder they're avoiding us. What's their problem then? - Fear. Abject fear. - Of what? Their fear extends to the point of not talking about their fear. Perfect. Let's not exacerbated it by staying any longer. D'Argo, beyond that concealment canopy is Armageddon. Do we really wanna fly into that right now? I'll ask 'em if we can stay. They're not gonna like it. So what should we do in the meantime? We get married. What? Now. You will make a beautiful bride. I will see to it. - Emperor Staleek. - What is it? We have received a deep-space comm cipher. - We receive tens of thousands... - This is from a most unexpected source. With a most unexpected message. It is about John Crichton. The sender knows the Human's current location. An out-of-the-way water planet. No defenses to speak of. - Do the Peacekeepers have him? - Not yet. Your source, is it reliable? At the moment, impeccable. Have a course plotted. We will send a full battle contingent. A full contingent for one man? Not for the man. For the knowledge he possesses. It's very generous of you to do this for us. It is the first time I have presided over the union of soldiers. We're not soldiers. In fact, he's the only one carrying a gun. Either way, your petition to remain among us is being denied. On conclusion of your sermon, you will all leave. Right. If you don't mind my asking, who are you hiding from? Everyone. Aeryn's coming! The bride! The bride! Come on! - Okay, are you relaxed? - I am relaxed. - I've heard the key is being relaxed. - I am relaxed. - Stand here. Stand. - What about me? You're right here. - Good. - Okay, perfect. What are you doing? No, no! Stark! Oh, she looks so... Beautiful. You look great. - You owe me. - I know. Is there a particular invocation you would like me to use? Yeah, um... Dearly beloved. "Dearly beloved." We are gathered here. "We are gathered here." Beneath this magnificent... Command Carrier. Peacekeepers. Lies. All lies! They seem to know exactly where we are. How, if the concealment canopy is still in place? They know because we have been betrayed. Stark, go with them. Witchiepoo, you go as well. - What should we do? - Convince them it's not our fault! Hide Rygel. Guard it with your life. It's not our fault. It's not our fault. We knew nothing about this. Crichton will fix it. - He'll fix it. I assure you. - Come on, old woman. Now, that's familiar. Why do I know that? Now! Oh. Eidelons. Of course! Eidelons! Eidelons. You're Eidelons. Yes, we are. You know who it's gonna be, don't you? I know who it is. Come on, "D," bet me. How much? You're on your own, my friend. Hello, John. Easy money. Apologies if this is a bad time, but I believe we need to talk. How did you find me? Harvey? - I would prefer to be called Albert. - No. Invisible sidekicks that only I talk to get called Harvey. How the hell did Scorpius find me? Scorpius is like God. He does not play dice with the universe. He has a great plan, John. But his mysteries unfold slowly. Perhaps they will be answered when the proper tribute is provided to him. The wormhole! Or in your case, the wormhole weapon! Listen up, Strangelove, I can find wormholes, sense when they will open. Push comes to shove, I can even navigate one. But I cannot make a wormhole weapon! That is true, John. But you do know where to obtain the knowledge. It does not take an Einstein to figure that out, huh? Make sure he gets that message. So how have you been, Crichton? - I'm good, Bob. You? The wife? The kids? - Busy. Yeah. I hear business is booming. You're right. The Scarrans and Peacekeepers are at war. And the Scarrans will prevail unless you help us build a wormhole weapon. Gee, that all sounds reasonable, Bob. Only two problems. No matter what you may believe, I can't do it. Just as important, I don't think Peacekeepers are any better than the Scarrans. So make sure you validate your parking... on the way out. You will find no serenity during this conflict, Crichton. Examine your choices. You are not listening. Wormholes, no! Weapons, no! Killing, no. Crichton, no. You want to see it? The thing you've been chasing my ass all over the universe for. Torturing me, my wife, my friends for. - You wanna see it? - Yes. - Say please. - Please. - Pretty please. - Pretty please. - With a cherry on top. - With a cherry on top. Happy birthday. Now get out of my sight. D'Argo, D'Argo, a miracle! Eidelons, Jool, Arnessk, peace! Okay, what's he talking about? Eidelons, Jool, Arnessk, peace! Thank you. Please. We are the last Eidelons. - All others hunted to extinction. - Hunted? Our ancestors possessed the means to influence peace. A gift that sadly has not survived to our generation. I'm familiar with the history. Then you would also know that 12,000 cycles ago their great temple was destroyed, the conciliators were murdered, and all outposts of our species, slaughtered. Arnessk was the center of our spiritual power. The sight of the long-Iost great temple, upon which this very edifice is modeled. However, today, Arnessk is a barren and lifeless world. Perhaps not. We've been there. These images are part of a data upload transmitted by Jool before we left her on Arnessk. I have more in the archives if you require. Undoubtedly you will recall... Except not you because you weren't there. It was right after Crichton realized that he loved you more than anything. - And you were as frizbot as a... - Shh. Hmm? Oh! Arnessk. These ancient Eidelons were not long dead as everyone assumed. Just suspended in time for 12,000 cycles. When we reversed the device that was holding them, back they came into existence. Right after I went swimming with the creature from the black lagoon. That sounds exciting. There is no doubt that today's Eidelons are a direct descendent of the ancient peacemaking Eidelons of Arnessk. And? They have a unique ability tied to their physiology. Which is latent in our host Eidelons. Why can't their ancestors reignite that ability? Thus recreating the greatest peacemaking race in history! Am I going insane or is the crazy lady starting to make sense? - Yes. But I thought we were finished. - So did I. What happened to "run first, no questions later"? Scorpius. We wake up and he finds us before we have our first cup of coffee. - This is not our fight. - I agree. But as long as there's a war on, everyone's after me 'cause I'm the winner-take-all weapon guy. - Every time we get involved... I know. People die. We out of options? This Eidelon education program. - What are the odds it'll work? - Not good. Not good is the best odds we ever get. The most exciting aspect is the possibility of learning how to influence peace in others. Noble aspiration, High Priestess. We have discussed it amongst ourselves, and would be most appreciative if you would transport Pikal and Caa'ta to Arnessk for an introductory delegation. - But we can take many more. - As I have repeatedly said... Centuries of hiding do not melt away suddenly, Pikal. We remain skeptical about your motives. And that's just on our side. I know a little something of the Leviathans and their symbiotic Pilots. Peaceful to a fault, if I recall. To Moya or myself, violence is less than an option. Then I have a simple query. These beings that you ferry, do you trust them? Implicitly. Then I entrust Caa'ta and Pikal to your care. Tissue transferal conductor. The doc hasn't got all the bits, but you'll probably find everything you need up on your ship. And the doctor will give you detailed instructions. That's unacceptable. He's coming with us. No, I'm sorry. The doctor and I do not travel into Peacekeeper territory. We have some previous issues with them. Aeryn, this is a relatively simple procedure. My baby is in a Hynerian. It's nowhere near simple. Of course it is. This part attaches to Rygel, the other part to you. Before you know it, the baby's transferred. So elegantly designed. Anyone can use it. Good luck. - What? Where are you going? - Not with you. Why not? These Eidelons have just absorbed a thunderbolt revelation. I know more about their ancient culture than they do. They can benefit from my instructions until you return. Can I do it myself? No. Right. What the hell is he doing here? - We were invited. - Just stay there. I've thought this through. We need him. I don't like it. Well, blame me. I do blame you. I don't like it! I don't like it either. But we are currently flying through Peacekeeper controlled space during a war and he is a Command Carrier officer. Actually my most recent commission was commander of a full Peacekeeper armada. Uh-huh. Among other things! He knows all the current pass codes. I'll keep him away. I hope so. Oh, Aeryn, Rygel, off-limits. - Good morning, Commander. - Morning, Pilot. Moya looks beautiful. How much did you miss us? We have received a message that appears to have been hailing for some time. First Arnessk. I have enough of a fix that we can begin our journey. I will find the exact location from Moya's data banks as we grow closer. Excellent, Pilot. Proceed. - Their message? - Sure, Pilot. Who is it? Apparently the Royal Palace of Hyneria coming from someone named Bishaan. What is really happening there, Bishaan? It is this damned war. The Scarrans have already taken our outer territories. Millions are dead. You are a direct descendent of the royal lineage. If our people will unite under anyone, it will be under you. Cousin Rygel, you are welcome to return to Hyneria. You must returnl If Bishaan thinks I'll return to a shared throne, he is beyond diluted. Ow! You're not going anywhere. You rest. Some mother you're going to make. Ship-wide announcement for our new guests. Prepare for starburst, people. - Chiana, Chiana! - In here. Blessed Eidelon, may I enter the room and... Enough! What is it exactly about these guys that makes you so faasbotten? Are you serious? The Eidelons are remarkable negotiators. The Scarrans aren't gonna be reasoned with. But they will if... If what? Frell... - Is he propositioning me? - No. That's a very special gland. Smart. - In a weird place. - It's an antenna to feelings. An inner eye. Am I right, Pikal? Yes. And our history leads us to believe substantially more. It gets bigger? Not that we know. However, it vibrates. We used to be able to create an energy field that had a calming effect on individuals, allowing them to see reason. Yeah, but your little, limp thing. It can't do the trick anymore. Unfortunately not. We've really gotta get married. Now. She has a good strong kick. Perhaps to remind you that you're needed on the command deck. There is nothing to be done at the moment. You know the situation. Situations change. We are outnumbered, out-gunned, and our populace has grown averse to hardship. What are you trying to say? More to the point, what are you not saying? We have now lost every single battle since the start of the war. I seek your opinion on a truce. The Scarrans will accept no truce. Only surrender. A surrender then. When all is lost... only. What are the signs, my dear Grayza, that all is lost? A military leader who broaches surrender. Crichton has departed the water planet. My contact has provided approximate coordinates to his destination. Fearful flight or purposeful journey? He seeks the means to end this conflict. - Wormhole weapon. - Unknown. Though he does now have a traveling companion. - Scorpius. - How well do they guard Crichton? The Leviathan travels unescorted. Though Peacekeepers now protect the water planet, they have left. Order the remainder of our battle contingent to engage the enemy there. Defeat them. Then subdue the inhabitants. And this Decimator? To follow Crichton, and settle old scores. Any good vibes from the Eidelons yet? Caa'ta is suspicious. Imagine finding out your 12,000-cycle old relatives are still alive. I once thought my Aunt Ruth was dead. You can't believe the stuff we found in her closet. - Do you think they can do it? - I don't know. Think the Eidelons can stop this war? If they can't, we get to find another galaxy to live in. John, between you and me. - Lf this doesn't work, can you... - No, I can't. Ohhh, by Hedsmana's sight, why me? You're a Dominar. It has to count for something. Carry their baby. Marry them off. What next? Let them move in? What? Forget about it. This is all wrong. Stop! You are ruining my wedding. Honey? - What? - You're pointing a gun at the baby. I've traveled with the two of you for quite a while now. Known you since you first met. Over the cycles, there were times when it looked like you were gonna kill each other. Other times we couldn't have got you off each other with a fire hose! Sounds like a marriage to me. So, upon my pronouncement, may these two be joined as one and evermore let nothing come be... No! Pilot! What the hell is that? We're under attack by Tregans! You, hide. Reporting multiple harpoon strikes. Each with a hauling line attached. - Can Moya free herself? - There are too manyl The Tregan ship is already pulling us in. We're still in Peacekeeper territory. Most likely they're mercenaries. - What does that mean for us? - They're probably less likely to take prisoners. I've counted at least seven two-man craft coming towards us. They'll attempt to incapacitate Pilot and cripple Moya's vital systems. One way or another, this will all be over in half an hour. - These guys work for the Peacekeepers? - Quite likely. Right. You're with me. I wanna hear those pass codes. If the Dark Lord here can't convince them we're a Peacekeeper vessel, make sure you have an outstanding plan "B." We'll protect neurocluster. Chiana, Sikozu, go find Caa'ta and Pikal and keep them safe. - What about me? - How best can you help? - I can stay out of your way. - Excellent. This may not go as smoothly as you'd hoped. What? You don't do improv? When I received the signal you were still alive, my departure from Peacekeeper service was less than sanctioned. Meaning what? You there, hold position. We're about to find out. Do you know who I am? Scorpius. I take it, you are sentries for this sector, yes? I wasn't informed you were out here, sir. Nor do you know it now, lest it cost you your life. In special service to the Grand Chancellor, I order you to release and vacate this ship. That won't happen. And you are? Chief of my vessel. Our orders are to commandeer any ship not broadcasting a Peacekeeper ident. My mission would be jeopardized by advertising such a beacon. Your mission is more than jeopardized. It is over! Who is in charge here? Whom should I be addressing? And who is going to take the blame? Chief, release the harpoons. On Scorpius' authority. Your command code, sir. 767 decahelot. Scorpius, it is an honor to meet you face-to-face. That's a damn nice set of body armor. Does that come in blue? What the hell did you do when you left the fatherland? - Kill the goose that lays the golden egg? - Deserted my post. What? For little ol' me? It's amazing what a man will do when he's in love. Pilot, anything you can do to help? - Not without killing you also. - Hold that thought and be ready to duck. - Who's taking fire? - Who isn't? You all right? Other than being shot at by the Electric Mayhem, I'm fantastic! You must stay hidden. And you? Your sensitivity is of much more value when we are meeting our ancestors. It is my function to assure your safe arrival. - But... - There is no time to argue. Three of them heading parallel to us. You can see that? I can with my new eyes. Two. Son of a bitch! - Pilot, stay down! - I can't! We have to get outta here before Pilot gets shot. What we need is the release transmitter. - Where is that? - Over there with the head Treg. Fine. Surrender or die! You enjoy this, don't you, Crichton? You know this species? Then dead is okay. You never struck me as the type who would want children. You either, huh? He wants it so badly. So I do. You'll come around when you see the little guy in person. I hope so. All right, lover boy, get ready to cover me. Are you having fun yet, John? You call that covering fire? No more Tregans aboard. That's good news, Pilot. However, they're still reeling us in. - Because we can't release the harpoons. - Why not? 'Cause somebody sent the transmitter down the abyss. This transmitter, what does it look like? A star-shaped medallion. - Pilot? - All lines disengaged. We're free! Ooh! Guess they figured out their captain's dead. Rygel? Pilot, can Moya starburst? She will try. That's our girl. This is not good. Rygel? Rygel? Don't get your knickers in a twist. The baby is all right. I'm terribly upset I failed to detect the Tregans. 1812, pipe down. I was so preoccupied with other duties, they snuck up on us. That's all right, Pilot. You're a few thousand mistakes behind the rest of us. Hey, Pilot, how much is this gonna slow us down getting to Arnessk? The answer, Commander, is not at all. Excellent. Okay, I'm lost. Not lost. - Your business? - Hiya, Jool. - You. - Me. - Crichton. You? - Crichton. - You are crazy. - I knew you wouldn't forget me. The more we were apart, the more I knew you'd realize that you are meant to be with... Aeryn. - Jool. - Get your own fantasy, they're having my baby. Baby? And it goes without saying you show deference and respect. - Absolutely. - Please, don't embarrass me. Excellent acoustics, are they not? Perhaps you'd care to lead us in prayer. Apologies, Hierarch Yondalao. I was explaining to them... So you are the pilgrims who purport to be our heirs? Not us. Just him. Go. We understood all of our descendants to be gone. Though we trace ourselves to your lineage, my people have lost the ability, but not the desire to influence peace. Troubling. And exhilarating. I shall confer with the other conciliators and notify you when the matter can be assessed. I told you this was a waste of time. Myths are rarely satisfying upon examination. Hierarch, please. You know me. I know these travelers. They are honorable. Why do you send them away? I do not. I simply require time to examine the issue. But, but with great respect. What is there to examine? Pikal is an Eidelon like you. We have awakened from 12,000 cycles of sleep. What pertinence can we have to your galaxy now? But the war. The deaths, the slaughters! Peacekeepers, do your duty! The horror! Sit. May I speak? The Peacekeeper shall be heard. We apologize for invading your sanctuary. And we understand you have reason for caution. But what could be more pertinent in this time, or any, than the ability to inspire peace? Even if he's Eidelon, how can this one supplicant help that cause? You are few here, and Pikal's people are many. With your instruction, they could become a great force for peace. Though the Peacekeeper provides sound counsel, I still sustain reservations that must be meditated upon. Peacekeepers, clear the temple. Can you believe this? Somebody wants us to be Peacekeepers. Are you assassin? No! I'm just the guy without a brain. The Lion here would like some courage. Tin Man, he needs a heart. Toto here just wants an easy birth. And Dorothy here, she is just looking for a way home. Now we're not gonna be here tomorrow so I suggest you take a long hard look at our broomstick. He is your heir! An Eidelon. As youths, we open our faces to the universe, absorbing the joy and anguish all creatures feel. Then upon maturation, we step to the altar to receive Hora Dalay: The ability to encourage rationality and tranquility in others. The capacity to influence others toward peace carries great responsibility. Do you accept this burden for the rest of your days? It's going to work. With training, Pikal and his kind, should be able to stop the war. - No wormholes. - Exactly what I was thinking, John Crichton. Can we go back to Moya now? I'm starving. In a microt. Go and get Stark. - Is it just me or is he getting bigger? - It's a geometric pregnancy. Please tell me that means we're gonna have a mathematician. A soldier more likely. But we will be having it sooner than you think. How sooner? With genetic modifications put into someone born into a battle unit like myself, essentially we're going to be parents in a matter of solar days. Days? - We don't have a name. - Already picked one. Well, what? - Excuse me? - Do you not like it? Uh, boy or girl? Either. It works for both. You just made a joke. Soldiers don't have a sense of humor, John. You better have my dinner ready when I get back on that ship now. Is there nothing they can do? Then order retreat from Alentro Quadrant. Have Commander Spreddic regroup in defense of our nearest outposts. Sir, how have the Scarrans moved so quickly through our forward positions? Because they have been planning this for many cycles, Lieutenant. And you have a design to turn it around? Of course. In due time. Thank you for your assistance, Aeryn. Independent verification of hull integrity is invaluable to Moya and me. - It's the least I could do. - Lf you'll close the thermal-imaging ports, I'll begin cycling to numistatic distance calibration, completing our harpoon repairs. Back so soon? Why don't you tell Scorpius that continuously asking me will not change my opinion? Peace is still a better option than trying to build a wormhole weapon. Not spoken like a true soldier. Depends on your definition. With all due respect, Crichton is your inferior. So why would you bear his child? You should leave, Sikozu. And I mean off this ship. I did not mean to offend. When I first met Scorpius, I naturally assumed I was his superior. I have since learned there is a reservoir to his abilities that continually overshadows my own. Same with Crichton. You view Crichton as your superior? No, as my equal. Sikozu, perhaps your under and over estimations of yourself are meaningless. Perhaps you're just meant to be together. Interesting these Eidelons. Yep. Tell me about it, Bob. Despite the fable around them, these Eidelons can only affect peace when the combatants are willing to let them get near them. Am I detecting a little professional jealousy? The Scarrans for certain will destroy these Peacemakers long before they can get close enough to have any impact. Great! Then you won't mind them doing their thing. Fine! But do yours at the same time. Me making weapons is just a means to your ends. God! What is it you really want, Scorpius? Privacy achieved during peace will always be challenged. However, if ascended during conflict, it can last a lifetime. You wanna say that in English? We've been hit. I have a highly-developed survival sense. It's telling me to leave. John, it's a Scarran warship closing in on the planet at maximum speed. Stryker or Dreadnaught? Neither. Something new and much faster. How much time we got? More like how little. D'Argo! I'm on my way to get you now. Hey, where the hell do you think you're going? To remove as much of our presence as possible. The Scarrans will be hard enough on these Eidelons as it is. Don't worry about it. We're taking them with us. - Everyone has to go. - That is impossible. Jool, will you explain to him what is going on? - He knows. - Hierarch, listen. These are not chirpy Saturday morning Sleestaks coming. The decision has been made. The big hand says I don't have time to argue. And the little hand says, Pikal, it is time to go. He is not yet prepared to instruct others. His education must continue. We came here because we need conciliators. There is an entire planet of his people waiting. How the hell are we supposed to bring them up to speed? I will instruct them. Fine. Fine. Jool, you should come as well. I can't. I belong here. Go. You always made the best mistakes. This is not good. No dren! This frelling thing is supposed to get the baby out of me. I don't think so. - Not you, them! - Who them? What? You wanna worry about someone? Worry about me. The Eidelons. What about them? Their good give in peace. Their good sleep in peace. Their good die in peace! - Why aren't we moving? - Ask Pilot. The Scarrans are close enough to have targeted us. Initiate starburst. Moya refuses. Before she has time to fully power up, we will be hit. Any ideas for a diversion? Scarran vessel. The inhabitants of Arnessk are peaceful. We have no weapons and pose no threat. Do you wish to land? - What are they doing? - Deciding how savage they want to be. - Okay, come on. - You'll be safe in here. - Pilot, we can't just sit here. - Moya's got to take the risk. Pilot? At this range? It's suicide! Scarran vessel, please respond. Bad feeling. Jool, can you hear us? Get away from the temple. Now, Jool! The Scarrans have fired. - Evasive! - No time! Son of a bitch. Not us. Jool! Crew of Leviathan, you must immediately abandon ship and surrender to the Scarran lmperial Forces. Noncompliance with this command will result in the immediate annihilation of your ship. - Repeat, noncompliance with this command - We're cursed. Will result in the immediate annihilation of your ship. Everything we touch. Prepare for emergency starburst! - Crew of Leviathan... - Shouldn't I stay here? If anyone stays behind the Scarrans will destroy Moya. Come on! But I'm pregnant! Let's do it. I cross-connected the power drive and the fuel system so we can detonate ourselves should we choose. Comforting. "D," last chance to bail. I'm fairly certain they can't pierce Moya's invisibility shield. But you give us the signal, we'll be there. We hope. Good fortune. Now, get out of the way. Well, when this idiot plan dies, I would say I am the first one you rescue. Ask Aeryn. Rescue Yondalao first. Isn't he supposed to be rescuing us? Yeah, how about that? We stride onto the ship and you convince the Scarrans to smoke the peace pipe. They are a species unfamiliar to me. I must first sense their fears and desires through proximity. You're about to get all the proximity you can handle. Scarran vessels straight ahead. Probe the Leviathan. If you discover any life other than its pilot, annihilate the vessel. Oh, I must've overlooked this. Sorry. - You lived among the Scarrans. - Most of my life. Assisted their dying rituals. Passage to the other side. - Then you know their psyche. - As much as possible. Assist me with that knowledge. Welcome to my flagship. That was a temple you nuked down there. An act of precaution. Requisite in times of war. As is truth-seeking. The Luxan and Nebari who are traveling with you? Gone... a short while before we came. Strange. I always assumed His Highness was male. A tumor. Not long to live. I would agree. Take the Hynerian to separate barracks. Stop it. Let go of me! I find it troubling that Humans and Sebaceans can propagate together, and intriguing. How could you know that he was pregnant with their child? The same way I knew to find you here. - A traitor. - But who? Grunschlk. Ah, they say one traitor can always recognize another. If you hadn't facilitated Crichton's earlier escape, there would be peace now. With you the Supreme Ruler? A position I know you dream of, Scorpius. You, John Crichton, are alive for one reason only. I will have the wormhole technology you possess. If not, War Minister Ahkna will pleasure herself torturing the Hynerian and the abomination in his belly. You have one arn to decide. Here, here. Options? It's not ready. They have Rygel and the sand is trickling though the hourglass. - We can't give them wormhole weapons. - They don't know that. And I can give them the middle finger. You don't know what you're doing. I never do. You, give them nothing! Let's make a deal. One power source. Two compartments, forward and last. More intense, and smaller. And here. That's it. That's it. Excellent. I'll be able to stop 'em cold with three perfect shots. Why three? You usually slay me with just one. Rygel's invited us to Hyneria. Thought I could do some work with my hands. Plant some food, make some wine. Oh. Hey, Godzilla, let's get this over with. - You have something to give me? - Yeah. I got something you don't get very often. The truth. - I can't give you wormhole weapons. - Then you will die. You're asking for a kilo of pure wormhole technology which I don't have! But I can take you to a guy that does. In exchange, you give me Rygel. Undamaged, free and clear. Give me the coordinates! It doesn't work like that. You are immune to the probing. 'Cause I always speak the truth. Okay, here's how it works. We go in my module down a wormhole to the source of ultimate power. It's a two-seater. Me and one other. It's the only safe way to get there. The emperor will never go alone with you in your craft! I will accompany him. Yes, always good to see who wears the britches in a relationship. No! Set a course to rejoin the battle group at the water planet. We shall leave as soon as I return. It's a question of balls. The ball's in his court. How would they react? I see. If faced with such a moral choice, the Scarrans would still choose to slaughter innocents. A conundrum: How to tap into their morality. I must think. - Is there progress? - A great deal. - I will soon be able to influence their passions. - Excellent. In the temple, you said, "Peacekeepers, do your duty." What did you mean? I had forgotten that you had forgotten. At the dawn of our period of usefulness, 27,000 cycles ago, we developed need of a guard, a race no one had quarrel with. A force to insure harmony prevailed once negotiations had finished. Peacekeepers. Apparently your forebears attempted to carry on once we vanished. However, lacking our mediation abilities, they kept peace the only way they could: At the muzzle of a weapon. And that's why they're hated. It wasn't such at the beginning. We took great care to choose a species no one had met before. We found your kind primitive, barely clothed. Far removed on the galaxy's outer spiral. Having brought some of you back, your evolution was accelerated with generous alterations until you became our trusted acolytes. The emperor wants this one maintained. However, I would consider it a personal favor should he die of explainable causes. I grow weary. We'll stop for coffee on the way back. There is a problem? Take your hand off me. You know what you have to do, John. Yeah, I know exactly what I have to do. Just crash the module. No more Staleek. No more Crichton. No more Aeryn. No more anyone. Do you think War Minister Psycho-Drama's gonna be a kindler, gentler soul? Somebody else's problem. But you would've done your duty. Get your hand off me. Please take your hand off me. Get your hand off me. We shall return to my ship. There is no wormhole here. We're catching the 7:15 to Enlightenment. It's just a little late. I have been informed you plot escape. - We are prisoners with no weapons. - None here. But perhaps out there. I promise you. You will never be reunited with your baby. I'm sure your mother wished the same thing. How brave you are. Ordinance Officer, fire! Fire! - D'Argo! - They know where we are! Fire! You can stop now. You've proved your point. The Luxans are like Peacekeepers. Soon to be enslaved or dead. Fire. You... Enshrine their souls, end their suffering and guide the passage of D'Argo and Chiana to their place of rest. Cannot a Luxan survive in space? Quarter arn. Maybe a little longer. Scarran brutality surprises me. They will be difficult to influence. The Scarran blood that runs through my veins knows more than you'll ever know. The first scent of interference, you'll be as dead as D'Argo. And then the... There is only one path out of this prison. We must fight our way out! Bingo. This is the source of your knowledge? That and the back of cereal boxes. Cinch up your diaper, big boy. The first time is always the worst. This is normal? No. The module's overweighted. We got a big bubba in 2-B. Last chance, John. Veer into the wall of the wormhole. It'll be over fast. Nope. Child's gonna have a father. I hope it's a boy. Boy, girl, either is fine. Buckle up. Check it out. I'm Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer. You have violated our trust. He has my family. Unimportant to the greater agenda. They are my greater agenda. - Why have you brought him here? - Who is this creature? You can call him Einstein. I suggest you do it nicely. Staleek! Staleek, he can wrap time round his little finger. The whoo-doo voodoo is not gonna work. Einstein, do you possess the knowledge of wormholes? Yes. Can these wormholes be made into weapons? Yes. - Then you will give me that power! - No. Hang on. I can find a wormhole, and fly down one. Right? With the rudimentary knowledge we have given you. Can I make a weapon? You cannot. Why not? Because no one should have that power. Exactly! Listen up. This is your universe. This is your universe on wormholes. You mess with the natural order, you destroy multiple time lines. I will have that power! Humbling, ain't it? Returning here was wrong. I have to protect the people I love. And you owe me for putting that crap in my head. It may soon be prudent to remove it. Amen. I wanna be blond again. You truly cannot create wormhole weapons. We should get back before Rygel damages your wife. Absolutely not. Our best opportunity is when or if Crichton walks through those doors, we must try to escape! Not without my child. A disagreement past its time. - You should be dead. - And how was your day? I saw a wreckage on the way in. They killed Chiana and D'Argo. Is Yondalao good to go? Apparently not. Well, Staleek's gonna give us Rygel. You've traded ultimate power for an unborn offspring. No. I gave it to him. You know why? Because he's such a nice guy! But the funny thing is I don't have anything to give. So, Chiana and D'Argo, me being chased around the galaxy for years, everything, it's all for nothing. Your ranting aside, we still have no way out. I wouldn't be so sure. You have to do something. Time to transfer the baby. When I am ordered. However, I can give you something to eliminate the pain completely. Oh, that would be great. Hurry! Aah! Whose orders override mine? War Minister Ahkna. I had no choice. You will die when I order it. Okay. If I knew my word was useless... The Luxan stealth craft, I discovered and destroyed. The presence of Scorpius who has already betrayed you once, and the constant ability of these creatures to plague us with resistance. Add these up, and they should die for our own security. Scorpius is a commander in our enemy's armada. Officer Sun a former pilot. Who knows what information may be coerced from them! - It's not worth the risk. - Stop seeing Vitubian vipers in every shadow. And never countermand my orders again! Here, have him! Did they do anything to you? No. This maintains my portion of the accord. Beyond this, I promise nothing. With deference, Your Eminence. - Who are you? - Hierarch Yondalao. Triumvirate Council. Eidelon faction of neutrality. There is no such thing as neutrality. You travel with my prisoners, you are a prisoner. Emperor Staleek, you wish power, acknowledgement of your personal intelligence, and to gain acceptance in the upper echelon of civilizations. What do you know of my aims? Only that there are many paths to accomplish them. War is our path. At the peace table, we know how we're viewed: Brutish, ignorant. Then what greater victory than to prove them wrong? And without the loss of a single Scarran... life. I am listening. Now you will tell me this one Human holds such fascination that Scorpius would desert, the Scarran emperor would pursue. And we would all tremble at the power of his magical wormholes. Did you not tell me Crichton was powerless? His doomsday weapon a myth? That was my belief. This moment, however, is not without opportunity. Agreed. Knowing the emperor's whereabouts allows us to negotiate a peace proposal before our position becomes so eroded as to be laughable. Yes, my love. Of course. It also gives us the opportunity to surprise the Scarran leader and decapitate his empire. The sudden chaos in their ranks might tip the balance. And if that fails? No, I will not be remembered by history as the commander under whom Peacekeeperdom fell. No, my love. You will not. Because despite your station, you are weak. I say again that which I have said before. Death is preferable to subjugation under Scarran rule. They must be defeated. How? Chiana. Father. Not quite the Luxan greeting, but... - What are you doing here? - Right now? Saving your life. Thanks. Jothee, shouldn't we be running? Our concealment technology is three generations beyond yours. We could pull up beside 'em and they wouldn't know we're here. So, you're in command now. - He's a cleaver. - Cleaver? - Field officer. - Which means he's got brains. The rest of us just like to fight. What are you doing here? We've been following the emperor for quite some time. And then, there you were. We gotta take the crown head out, but his ship is pretty well impenetrable. One would think. Is this accurate? Looks like we could take him out in four shots. Three. Yes, that sounds quite reasonable. Absolutely. We're walking into Federationville here. You cross the T's. You dot the lower case J's, and we're good to go. Emperor, could you review the accord - that you wish all of us to agree to? - Of course. At the core of the matter is the perception that Crichton can create wormhole weapons. If I propose an armistice to the Peacekeepers with Crichton by my side, they will naturally assume he has bestowed a military edge upon the Scarran Empire. The Grand Chancellor is no gambler. He would indeed choose peace over a war he knows he would lose. Being benevolent, I will then propose an accord which favors us in mining rights and trade balance, whilst allowing complete self-rule of all Peacekeeper territories. And I'm out, right? You shall be released upon the signing. And a great many lives will be saved by everybody sim... Do you really wish to broker peace with an enemy you are certain to destroy? What is this? It is the proper course of action. If your kind has a prayer for the dying, fill your mind with it now that you may be comforted. He's passing over. The secret of peace is lost. It's not good. Stark, give him last rites. Oh, I cannot. I'm beneath him. Astro Boy, you can take his power, protect his gift. Oh, no, I cannot. Stark, you can! You're a Stykara. I've seen you do amazing things. When you pass someone over, you take what they know. - Help him help us. - Quickly before he dies. No, I cannot! Aeryn, help me! No, no! No, no! My mask! Don't touch me! - What have we done? - I don't know. Something good or something very bad. Hey, hey. We're gonna have to transfer the baby now. Now? - Can you remember what to do? - I think so. - You stay with him. Where's the transfer kit? - Over there. - Where? - There! - It's gas. - What? - You gotta be kiddin' me! - They're entombing us. Saleek, this is very unoriginal. What does this do? - Paralytic embalming agent. - Stark. Preserves living tissue without harming the brain. Scarrans use it on specimens they wish to dissect whilst they're still alive. Stay with me. Breathe, Rygel, breathe. - You've ruined my life. - I know. This war is not your responsibility. How am I supposed to protect you from the Peacekeepers and the Scarrans and the Tregans and the lions and tigers and bears? This is what you want. No, Aeryn, it is not what I wantl It's just that fate keeps blocking all the exits. And no matter what I do, I just keep circling closer to the flame. Breathe, Rygel, breathe. - Rygel? - Rygel! He's unconscious. I'm gonna have to get him up, get him outta this gas. Gas. Is this stuff flammable? Preservatives? Combustible. At a very high temperature. - You can ignite it? - The gas is smothering my receptors. Come on, we're gonna get you to higher ground. On my count. One, two, three! So basically you're going to blow us up. Whoa! Whoa! I can direct it. Find cover. - What was that explosion? - Internal. Level 21. Insurgency teams to containment quarters. All teams, now! - Explosion at mid ship on the Decimator. - Crichton. - Those are not internal. - All systems off-line. Stark, weapons. We all need weapons. Feel like killing someone? Okay, maybe not. We need more than weapons. We need a plan. - We have to transfer the baby. - Now? His pulse is slowing. He's dying. Okay, okay. John, Aeryn, are you there? I'm hearing dead people. "D," how are you alive? Long story. Can I give you a ride? - Absolutely. In what? - It's gonna be a big surprise. You stay put. We got a fix on you. We'll come to you. You heard him. This is the Alamo. Brace. Go! Chiana, call Peacekeeper Command, confirm our coordinates. Go! Good luck. Luxan commandoes confirmed aboard, sir. Secure my ship! Aeryn, we gotta hurry. I'm losing a pulse here. - Here they come! - Ready when you are. Man, am I glad you're not awake for this. All right. You might feel a little pressure. Hold still. Hold still! - War Minister Ahkna, report. - Positioning to cut them off now! I'm really sorry about this, baby. Just get it right the first time. - Nobody gets it right the first time. - Wait! Are you okay? I'm pregnant. - I'm running out of ammunition. - As me. - Well done. - Thank you. Rygel, you all right? Thank you. - He's out again. - What is this? Whatever you put in my head is gonna explode! You're not gonna be the only thing around here exploding if D'Argo doesn't show up. Stop acting like a bunch of losers and look down! Hey, the cavalry's here. Okay, stand back. It's no good. We can't get through. It's Dorian ore. It's pulse resistant. How are we supposed to get to you? I don't know. All the lifts are sealed. We better make it quick. Our surprise is wearing off. Stand aside! Get back! All right, ladies and children first. You look great. - I'm pregnant again. - Congratulations. Don't you touch me! Catch! Feel free to stay and cover our retreat. Holy crap! It's good to see you, Jothee. Yeah, who'd have guessed? Good to see you too. We done? Quick! Go, go, go, go! Get out! Go! Get outta here! Move, move! Damage repair immediately. The Peacekeeper armada is sure to be on its way. And we are sitting fodder! Move! Coming through! Here. Go, get in! You guys are a mess. Everybody hang the frell on! You've grown, dude. Yeah? Well, it's the armor. I'll take over, Sergeant. You take care of the engine. Sir. So was this a planned reunion? You got any backup out there? Well, they can't maneuver or fire so we're good to go. Nice work, Cleaver. Yeah. Well, the old man had a lot to do with it. Peacekeeper armada confirmed on scanned perimeter. Tell me. When will we stop following this Human and start imposing our agenda on him? We already have. Crichton insists he will not build a wormhole weapon. He insists he can't. Human insistence. Nothing more than a futile attempt to avoid action they insist they will never take! He will help us? Never. But he will help Aeryn and his new child. Luxan penetrator out and away. See you back in Kajargan. - Safe journey. Can I speak to Jothee? - Sure. You need a guide to get through Peacekeeper-controlled space. Chiana was the first person since your mother that I really cared about. I'm glad you and Chiana are back together. Day by day. Trust takes time. Yes, it does. I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy. Can't do that, can't do that. I can't do it. John, where are you going? We can see the comms are open. Would you answer please? Frell. Scarrans continue to fight. It is clearly Staleek's vanguard. We're outnumbered and under attack. The command carrier is heavily damaged. We are unable to defend it. Ma'am, the grand chancellor is dead. A great tragedy for our people. Arrange a ship-wide memorial service. And set a course for Captain Braca's location immediately. With respect, ma'am, High Command is sending Vice Chancellor Vosler... Don't let the belly fool you, Lieutenant. You were aware of my status? Commandant, ma'am. - Within this battle group, who outranks me? - No one. Then send apologies to the vice chancellor for the extra distance he will have to travel. And set a course for Captain Braca's location now. Ma'am. Your assumptions were correct, Excellency. My spy informs me that the water planet Crichton previously visited was populated by a species called Eidelon. Yes. Same as the frelling creature they brought on board to cloud my mind. Obviously a plan to defeat us with trickery. All speed to the water planet. Crichton is no longer our only threat. Inform me when every single Eidelon is dead. It's time! Indeed. Unlock the knowledge. I have to make peace. - Time... - Flies. - Time... - Bandits. - Time... - Wounds all heals. - Time... - Rosemary and... Time... Time ends. Crichton, you possess it, don't you? Don't... touch me! The secret to victory. The violent path to peace. Congratulations, John! Damn, it's big! It's bigger than big! These wormhole weapon plans are complicated. But I think we can build it to budget. - My head is killing me. - Give the man a hard hat. Oh, you MBA types. I didn't get this for you. Ladies. This project, John, is for both of us. "Coming this year, Wormhole weapons to the stars. Harvey and John's Construction and Engineering." John and Harvey. I can make us a new sign. You agreed to do the job. Now we gotta build it. We're on my time table. You're fired! You went there, didn't you? I went the whole way there. - I didn't want you to do that. - Yes, you did. Everybody wants to see the great big wormhole weapon. I want to see war turned into peace. War and peace. War and peace. Did you know that Woody Allen's version is better than Tolstoy's because it is funnier? And absolute power corrupts absolutely. Where the hell's my pen? Where's my pen? This is what you want. This is what you want! No, Aeryn, it is not what I want! It's just that fate keeps blocking all the exits. And no matter what I do, I just keep circling closer to the flame. Then pull back. This war is not your responsibility. You and the baby are my responsibility. And how am I supposed to protect you from the Peacekeepers and the Scarrans and the Tregans and the lions and tigers and bears? With this? This gun? No gun is big enough. We still have Stark and the Eidelons. It's not enough. This is enough. Wormholes. What's inside my head. This is ugly, and it is malignant. - But it will protect you and the baby... - Ah, you see? You don't just protect me. We protect each other. Did you feel that? It kicked. I can really feel it alive inside me. Here, Starky. I don't remember him being like this. Nobody does. Toad, what's with the waterworks? - I miss the baby! - What baby? - He had a baby? - It's kind of a twisted story. It's the chemical imbalance in his system from carrying the child. He will recover eventually. Are you all right? I'm quite fine. I can't do this without your help, Pilot. Or is it Moya's? This will be used as a weapon against others? Worse case scenario, yeah. If I understand correctly, it has the power to kill tens of thousands. For starters. Are you capable of using this? Yes. Then I don't know you as I thought. So you'll be starting with me then? Someone points a gun at your head, what do you do? You defend yourself. And that is why we have to build this. No one has a weapon pointed to your head. God, Pilot! Everybody's got a weapon pointed at my head! There are other options. Explain that to the millions who will die in the meantime. Is that truly your concern? Or is it Aeryn and your un-birthed offspring you wish to protect? That's my family, Pilot. Everything begins with family. Scarrans! - What the hell is happening? - We're in a crossfire. What are the Scarrans doing here? Pilot, get us out of here. How're the Eidelons holding up? Their city is also under attack. There are too many of them! What? No hailing? Not even on our part to surrender? Pilot, what are you doing? Not me! It's Moya! She's heading into the ocean! Crank! See? Fate. Can Moya do this? She's done it. She should be watertight. Should be? Harpoon holes notwithstanding. Don't fool yourselves. The pressure differential down here compared to the vacuum of space is huge! We will flood! Pilot, where is Moya intending to go exactly? Pilot? Welcome to the bottom. Pilot, we have light showers in here. What are we seeing everywhere else? Sikozu's assessment is accurate. Many tiers are taking on water. If we're going to make peace, we have to get Stark to the Eidelons. - Okay. How do we get back to the surface? - Transport pod. If Moya's not watertight, then transport pods won't be either. We'll have to make one watertight. Come along. Where is Stark? I can't locate him, Commander. Yeah, right here. Don't get your minivox in a twist. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. But Stark went completely fahrbot when he heard the Scarrans blowing the Hedsmana out of the Eidelons. - Where is he? - Don't know. I'm on tier 7. Hard to track him through the water. I'll check the lower tiers. I got topside. We're going to need more weapons on the surface. - I'll raid the armory. - Right. Be careful. I'm pregnant, not incapacitated, John. Right. Pregnant. Come on, Stark! Give it up! You act like you're high half the time, but we got an ocean ten feet above our heads. Holy crap. Anybody see him yet? Nope, but when I do you're gonna know because I'm gonna rip his arm out. He's not on the lower tiers. All right. You go to the bow. - I got the aft. - My pleasure. Stark, I know what you're feeling. You got something in your head that everybody wants. Something that never should've been there in the first place. I promise you, we'll get it out. We damn well better get it out. Approaching water planet. One damaged command carrier on scans. Multiple Scarran ships bombarding her. Do we have surprise? From all indications, no cannons swiveling to our vector. Have you isolated the emperor's vessel? Not yet. Then target all craft equally. Shock wears off quickly, ladies and gentlemen. You know how I change my mind about things sometimes? I get so excited. I say I'm gonna do it and I really... frelling mean it. And then I change my mind completely. Yes. Hyneria. I'm gonna do it... with you. - You know why? - Because you like Hynerians? Not so much. But I like you. Can you hear that? That's just the sound of a DRD. And that is the sound of our ship, Moya, under pressure. And this... is the sound of an AKR maximum load ammo pack being chambered into a full-grade field ranger pulse pistol. Are you all right? Yes. The baby is just kicking a lot. I should go and help find Stark. We said no to John. I know. Moya and I will have no part of mass murder. None of us want to, Pilot. But if we don't, the outcome will be worse. Are not Stark and the Eidelons preferable to the wormhole weapon? Of course, but I'm not sure they can do it. You know, we all want the same thing, Pilot. Peace. Hello, D'Argo. I found him. He's in the lower maintenance bay. I'm sorry I ran like I did. It was mindless of me. Are you okay? Fine actually. Remarkably fine given the responsibility that now resides within me. So it worked? It's inside you? Yondalao's knowledge. We really have to get outta here. We're in awfully deep, aren't we, D'Argo? Please, Stark, we have to go. Water. Yeah, there's lots of water. More water. Get down! Breach on the lower tiers where D'Argo and Stark are! I'm close and moving. Where are they? Here. Over here! D'Argo, no. Look after him. Thank you. Are you all right? I saw the most amazing thing before I almost died. What? The vision? The light? - Your ancestors? - No. I saw a big wall of water and the ground as my nose was scraping along the floor. You're lying. It's not your regular brand. Eidelon. Crichton, I'm not afraid anymore. Hold that thought 'cause we're going to the surface. Grand Chancellor Maryk. Get us into that battle! Nothing matters but the carrier. You all right? It's beyond me why women would choose to do this more than once. - They say three is the magic number. - Three is a scary number. Come on, move! Let's go! Stark, come with me. We're too late. We don't know that yet. Come on. - Where are the Eidelons? - The Scarran term is nullified. Sergeant Learko, this is Cleaver Jothee. Sergeant, are you there? More like here, sir. What's the situation? Scarrans control the whole of the city. Isolated pockets of Peacekeepers, but they're being steadily neutralized. - What about the Eidelons? - Slaughtered, even in surrender. The rest of our men are on the other side of the city searching for survivors. We have to get Stark to them. Captain Braca, are you still alive? - Very much so, sir. Good to hear your voice. - Your location? The great temple. We're holding out with a band of Eidelons. My requests for reinforcements have been unheeded. There's some on the way. Stay tight. Yes, sir. Let's move. You're on point. Sergeant Learko, you go with him. Stark is now our number-one priority. Stark? How's that for an inversion of normalcy! Don't get shot up too much. I was thinking the same thing about you, old man. Why can we not immolate that city? Weapons systems is inoperative from the Luxan attack, Excellency. Excuses aside, I want every single Eidelon eliminated. It is being attended. That chair becomes you. Reports from prior to our arrival suggest that Crichton and the Leviathan perished in the ocean below. Would you agree? I would rather have his head as proof. Once the Peacekeepers have been defeated, I intent do oversee larger galactic governance issues. Bring me Crichton's head and all differences between us will be resolved. Paving the way for you to assume my position, Empress Ahkna. Why no opposition on this path? Scarran shock teams containing a small number of troops, delivering a high body count. Looks like they went street by street. Extermination pattern. Now they're down there. How hard's it gonna be for everybody to leave each other alone? Impossible, I'd say. I would like you to name the baby Rygel. Maybe... if it's a girl. All right, folks, when things go to hell in a hand basket, we meet here. It's a good spot for Moya to pick us up with the docking web. Okay, everyone, let's move out. Very impressive subjugation. I dread my cities looking like this. Hi, Grunschlk, going somewhere? Oh, I suspect you have some serious issues. - Shoot the traitor. - I'm not a traitor. Someone relayed our location to the Scarrans after we left. Someone else. Have you signaled to anyone that we're here? Signaled? I'm trying to get away. From a Scarran weapon. So? We use that trick all the time. Look, Missy New Eyes, my dealings with the Scarrans are purely financial. Okay, enough talk. Either we kill him or we take him with us. - Take him. - Scarrans. - Okay, down. - Go! Go! We can take those Dreadnaughts on. A pulse blast would bring 100 Scarrans. They don't know where we are. I wanna keep it that way. Don't move. There's enough here for both of us. Go. Scorpius, there's movement outside the temple. Yes, Captain, we're on approach so hold your fire. Thank Juka. We were worried it was another Scarran insurgency team. Braca, open the door! Good to see you. You're the reinforcements? No, we're the band. Looks like Kiss was your opening act. Frell, I'm in the wrong band. Report. Six of our troops, two trained Eidelons, four others who refuse to bear arms. The Diagnosan, minimal munitions. At least the Scarrans don't know we're here. Let's keep it that way. Sergeant? He's a spy. Watch him. I am not a spy! I report, my spy is trapped inside one of the city's largest edifices. Most interestingly, with Crichton. - So, he lives. - Rectified shortly. I continue to keep your future seat warm for you. Stark, you're the reason we came. Is Muoma here? Yes, she's around the corner. Do you have a plan? We had a good plan till your guys shot us down. I don't suppose they'd loan us a ship, would they? No, I'm afraid Commandant Grayza's focusing on other issues. The grand chancellor's dead. I suggest we observe operation silence. Fortify our defenses. Doc! Your water just broke. That means the baby's coming. Doc! - Big baby. That's good. - The timing isn't. Considering the amount of fire power it takes to drop a single Scarran, we're in trouble. We should disassemble the weaker munitions. Make our own shot grenades. Arts and crafts. She's gonna be a great mom. She's right about the fortifications. Captain Braca, Scarrans. Take cover! Small arms, but a lot of weaponry. Everyone, help me close up this door. War Minister, the structure is surrounded and prime for takeover. Excellent. When we attack, the Peacekeeper female is to be left for me. I just spoke to Pilot. Said he won't be ready till dawn. At least a couple of arns. Is there anything I can do to help? You've done enough already. If this was a Sebacean child, a pure one, it would've been born long ago. So, how long is this going to take? On Earth it can last days. I have killed men for less. Hey, baby birthing was not part of the original deal. Hey, we will be renegotiating. How's it going? I'll explain the processes as best I understand it. - When they finish meditating... - We are ready. High Priestess, prepare yourself. The legends are true. Our heritage, Yondalao's knowledge, lies within me. It has left me completely. - Will you be able to educate the others? - Of course. And make peace? Our numbers are too few. Many more are necessary to make a lasting contribution. We might be able to do something about that. - Jothee, pick up the phone. - Hello, Crichton? Noranti, what the hell are you doing? Rescuing Eidelons. What are you doing? Where's Jothee? Gone on reconnaissance with his men. Their comms are off. What's the situation there? Any Eidelon that isn't dead appears to be hiding with us. Upwards of 100, I'd say. I'm in charge, Crichton. Jothee has made me an honorary commando. - Tell me he didn't give you a gun. - Most certainly. But pulse packs are in short supply so it's not loaded. Moya won't be able to pick them up all together. She'll barely be able to take us. Listen, Grandma, call us when Jothee gets back. There's a lot happening. I'll try and remember. I have to go now. We can get you 100. If we were all to be reunited, peace is possible. Just keep doing your thing. We'll get you there. Fantastic job. You're the Johnny Appleseed of detente. Thank you. Thank you. Johnny Appleseed? Enough! Don't touch me! Everything he does causes more pain. This woman could chew her own arm off. What is going on? No, no. No hablo Diagnosan. What the hell's he saying? The baby's turned round. In a bad way. Tangled in the cord. And the translation is extra! Entangled. Breached. Must manipulate. But you can fix it, right? They're here! Return fire! Aeryn, get down! You have to give birth! Key for their muzzle fire. Frelling Scarrans! They will charge! Use your weapon! Need your help. Stay down! We're way outnumbered. Our number's about to grow by one. Can you help Aeryn? - I'll do it myself. - The baby is breached. I can't birth her narl. I don't want a narl. I hate narls. I'm still a narl myself. - You helped Moya give birth. - I blew out a wall and three tiers. I concur. The baby's head is up. It has to be down. Don't make any structural changes. I'll be right back. Mind if I borrow your knife? Careful, it's sharp. - How are we looking? - Stay here. We're not looking too good. Scarran experts, what are our tactical options? In this position, very limited. A distraction and a break. Some make it, some don't. We've got to stay. We've got no choice. Pilot isn't ready. You heard the man. Batten down the hatches. We stay and defend. Uncooperative. Twisted up. She's having it. - I need you. I need you to reload my weapon. - I'm here, baby. - If she keeps firing it past my head, I quit! - Fine! If she doesn't stay still, I can't do this. If I don't fire, we're dead. Sweetheart, for once let me cover you. - Can you do this? - Yes. Maybe if she stays still. Shooting makes me feel better. Honey. All right! But do it quickly. Come on. One, two, three. Jothee, you're back. We were worried about you. Biggest threat so far is this crazy old witch you travel with. - How're things going? - We're deep in it. We're gonna try to make a break for Moya. You guys got a plan? Found a nice Scarran transport vessel. Should hold all the Eidelons. Good luck! I believe one of our empty troop vessels is under attack. Comms went silent after an initial transmission burst. We have others. Ignore it. How long before your engineers are ready here? Moments, Minister. They're charging! Fall back! Reinforce the defense perimeter. Move back! Move back! Hey, all right, listen. - We gotta get you in the fountain. - What? - Into the fountain. - You get in. It's the most exposed position. It's better for the baby. It's cleaner, safer. Hey, do you want this thing out of you or not? Hold your positions and fire! John, get these! Come on, hurry up! Move it! - Hey, you all right? - You all right? Okay. - We're gonna get you up, in the fountain. - No. - Build a barricade. - Yes, sir. Learko. Say hello to the... cleaver for me. Tell him... Tell him it was an honor to serve. Up. Soldier, your wounds mean nothing! Attend to your position! Untie me. Give me a weapon. I'll only shoot myself. Honest! Leave the dead! Reload. Careful. - Captain. - Yes, sir? We need as many weapons as possible to the breach holes. Sikozu, I have something for you to do. - Astro. - We're... Just a few scratches. How long till first light here? Another arn at most. Pilot, where are you? I am here, Commander. Yeah, and when are you gonna be here? Preparations are almost complete. Perhaps in an arn. Hopefully we'll be there. - Come on, in you go. - No! Come on. Come on. Come on, in the fountain. Listen, we need raslak. Lots of it. Come on, in the fountain. Here we go, here we go. Okay. I've untangled the baby. You gotta get her in the fountain. She pushes, you pull. I'm done. You're fired! In the fountain. You like this? It's very inventive. I've never met a spy more resourceful, more tenacious. Scarran comms device. What did you expect? How long have you known? Long enough for you to service my desires. Unfortunately, your desires no longer serve my needs! They promised to free my people from their servitude! They will not, and you have blown something unique. What are you doing? Hold still. All right, Aeryn, we have to get ready. Great. I'll cut it out. No! It's for your clothes and for the cord. Oh. Right. Whoa, whoa, easy, easy. All right, breathe. Breathe with me. Inhale. Exhale. Does anybody have a plan that doesn't involve the word surrender? There's absolutely no way we can withstand another assault. Agreed. Let's go on the offensive. Bring me every weapon we have. I'm gonna create a little diversion. Exhale. With me, with me, inhale. Sir, where's Sikozu? On her final mission for the Scarrans. Get down! Everyone get down! Too much fun. Can we go now? I think it's time to push. - I can't! - You can! You can! Push! Here. - I'm helpless. - You're not helpless. I'm here. Come on, push! - Wait. Stark! - What? - Come here. - Do you want me to take your pain? No. I want you to marry us. What? - Now. - Aeryn, we can go to Vegas tomorrow. - No! - Marry us! Wait, wait, wait. What? Ah. Here. It was with the crystals. I kept it moist for you. - It's my mom's ring. - That's wonderful! You didn't think I'd go back into that cold ocean for nothing! Quick, quick! Come on! Idiot! That's a Shayan prayer for the dead. What? Dobian puberty right. Okay, okay. You two love each other? Yes! Enough to be married forever? Yes! Then you are. Congratulations. Thank you! He's alive! Here, stick him in this bag. We'll carry him. Father, I don't think we're gonna be able to get to you. If we're gonna make it to Moya, it's gonna have to be further away from the battle. Can you get past the Scarran lines? Yeah, we got a chance. Yes. Just one more time! Oh! Now push! Push, push, push, push! Push! Its head. Wow! We have a son. We have a son! - We did it. - I love you. I love you too. Hey. - Could you do me a favor? - You name it. Can you get us out of here? Done. Fall back! Take high positions! Ambush them in the street. Fool. Where are they? Pilot, we're on the move. I have to bring Moya's propulsion up to maximum to break free of the seabed. No one I'd rather have in charge. We'll be there. How's your honeymoon? Well, the brochure was better. There's too many boot prints, and they're fresh. We're not alone. Inside! Get back! Get back! There's too many! Take cover! Come on, go, go, go! I hear Bolivia is perfect for a honeymoon. They're pinned down, War Minister. Supply the troops in the buildings with missiles. We get hit with any more of those missiles, and we are Spam! We'll try for that building. Set up a crossfire so we can move. Go! Cover fire now! Go! Move out! I'm out! All right, one through twenty. We are lifting off now! - You can be at the cliff when Moya arrives. - Not 'til we clear this path! Oh, that'll be easy. - Sounds like you guys could use some help. - Son! We thought you were gone. - How far away are you? - A lot closer than you think. Okay, everyone down, down. Get down! Again! You're good to go. I wish I could pick you up. But along the way, I rescued some stragglers. You gonna be all right? Yeah. Moya's on the way. Thanks for the help. I'm proud of you, son. It's all genetics, Father. It's like the Luxan lottery. Okay, get outta here. I'll see you weightless. Y'all be careful out there. That means you. Let's move. We'll wait for a signal. Now you cry? I'm fine. Fine. At least you die. It's a boy... in case you were wondering. We're gonna have to get to the meeting point. Can you make it? Hurry up! D'Argo, hurry up. Come on. None of that. Someone has to be here. May as well be me. No way. Hey. We'll fix you up. - We have to go. - You'll be fine. - Come on. - More Scarrans will be here before Moya is. I'll stay, you go. No! Yes. This won't heal. It won't fix. It won't... I'll take your pain. No. Pain is good. Means I'm still alive. Then let me help you to the other side. This is the other side. I was hoping to go back. Come on, Rygel. Hey, hey. Come on, let's go. - No. - Let's go! Give me some pulse rifles. Give me some pulse rifles! Okay. It's gonna get uglier soon. You better get going. You're the closest friend I have. You could've done better. Nowhere in the universe. You got a lot of life to lead, John. Two big things. Do me a favor? Name it. I'll look after her. I'll take care nothing's gonna happen to her. Go away. I wanna speak to Chiana. I'm gonna miss you. Stop it. No laughing. Don't make him laugh. Hey. Please don't die. - We all die. - No. - I love you. - No, no... Take this. - Take this, take this. - I don't want it. Take it! John. Take it. - Don't leave me. - I'll find you. - I love you. - I'll find you. The first Scarran you see, you tell him who his daddy is. Tell him, D'Argo! I'm almost to the surface. Moya senses there are still many Scarran attack ships out there. Get ready to jump. What? It's safer to fall into the web than risk being scooped up by it. - Give me the baby. - No. I'll be hovering. I won't fall. He's safer with me. I'm your daddy! Let's do it. Good luck. We'll need it. On my count. One, two, three... jump! - Pilot, have we heard from Jothee yet? - Safe. As is the ship they commandeered to rescue the other Eidelons. How soon can we rendezvous? We have to get Muoma into play. We can't, Commander. We're on opposite sides of the battle zone. I'm doing all I can to keep us from being destroyed as it is. I don't care what you say. He's got my nose. The frellings killed my D'Argo. He wanted you to survive. You have to keep your wits. Come on. Even if these three Eidelons on board are enough, - I propose... - Not now! Pilot, have we heard from Staleek or the grand chancellorette? No, Commander. How the hell did this get here? The DRDs built it to your specifications. What changed your mind? Not what. Who. It's operational? As far as I can tell. This will make a wormhole weapon, yes? I thought this is what you wanted. At the time. Not now. Not ever really. Pilot, can we run? We're too damaged to starburst. And the Peacekeepers and Scarrans seem as intent on annihilating us as they are each other. Jothee, can you hear me? Pretty tight over here. I can't make it to you. Cut loose. Get clear. You understand me? Copy. Everybody safe? It's a little crazy around here for roll call now. Just get as far away as you can. We'll catch up. Hey, come here. Kill the frellings. And kill them others too. If you can kill them slowly, do it. Back off. Keep away! D'Argo's dead. Do you think I frelling care what I do to you? Yes. D'Argo is dead? Yes, Pilot. Saving us. Is there another way? I don't see one. Do you? It's worse than you think. Is it worse than D'Argo being blown to pieces? Is it worse than our son dying? Is it worse than living with this? Come here. Closer. You wanna see it? The thing you've been chasing my ass all over the universe for? Torturing me, my wife, my friends for? Formidable weapon. You wanna see it? Yes. - Beg. - I beg you. That's not good enough. Say please. Please. - Pretty please. - With cherry on top. - With cherry on top. Happy birthday. Now get outta my sight. Behold, the wormhole weapon. That? Yeah. Ain't it beautiful? Is this some kind of joke? Cosmic. Keep watching. Blink and you'll miss it. There. Isn't that sweet? Baby's gonna grow. Pilot, are my comms open? It's time for a birth announcement. Comms are open, Commander. Attention, ladies and gentlemen, and all ships at sea. If you look out your front window, you will see, by special request, your very own wormhole weapon. Crichton, what's happening? The end of all this crap. Hey, Emperor Sleestak, you big upright iguana. What does it look like from the Death Star? Sir, do you wish to respond? Yes. Increase fire power. Increased rate of fire. And begin reverse thrust. Pull us out of here. Reverse thrust, one quarter. Can I get a huzzah from the grand Peacekeeper bitch? Wormhole at 12:00, Lucy. Ignore that hail. Continue all guns against the Decimator. That object is beginning to exert a gravitational pull on us. Steady retreat while continuing to fire. Unbelievable. Nobody has anything to say. How big is that thing gonna get? Big. Okay, boys and girls, here are the rules. Find a penny, pick it up. Double it. You've got two pennies. Double it again. Four. Double it 27 times, and you've got a million dollars and the IRS all over your ass. Round and round and round it goes. Where it stops, nobody knows. But it all adds up... quick. What do you mean we cannot reverse thrust? Because it's just not working. We're trapped here, ma'am. Pilot, how you doin'? Acceptable, Commander. Though Moya and I are beginning to question whether it makes any difference. We have tried to retreat from the wormhole, but are unable to escape. I know. Our destinies are no longer in our own hands. Give me my world. Cease fire! Ma'am, your orders? Hold all salvos. Silence the guns. What have you done, Crichton? What did you ask me to do, Sparky? "Crichton, please make the wormhole so we can all have peace. "Crichton, you gotta make the wormhole. We all want peace! "Crichton, make the damn wormhole. We gotta have peace!" How many times did you say that, Sparky? Wormhole. Peace. Peace. Wormhole. How many times, mister, I beg you, "Please with a cherry on top"? I'm sorry. I tried to explain it. I tried to tell them all. You do what you have to do. Kiss me. Here's how it lays out. Are you listening, Staleek? I am listening. Yes. Wormhole weapons do not make peace. Wormhole weapons don't even make war. They make total destruction. Annihilation. Armageddon. People make peace. Can you stop it? I don't know. Maybe. It eats the whole galaxy. Monumental black hole. Giant, swirling headstone marking the spot where we all used to live and play and slaughter the innocent. This is insane. God! Four years on and you're finally getting that. You will not go through with this. - I already have! - I agree. You are weak. You will not sacrifice the woman and your offspring. Our son will be raised in peace. Amen. You hear that, you bastards? All or nothing. Wormhole doubles two more times, Moya goes first. Twenty seconds later, you join us. Either way, this war is over. Peace. For the sake of our children, I will agree to a settlement. May the spirit of peace descend on Staleek. May the spirit of peace descend on Staleek. Save some for me. I don't know. If it is the largest black hole, then it's a death worthy of a Dominar. Peace. Agreed. The Eidelons participate? A real peace? Agreed. Stop this thing. Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Wake up! Wake up. No! Whenever we cross paths, I leave the encounter transformed. And no more so than on this occasion. Thanks to you, I have found my own internal peace. Remember me, John. Till we meet again. Did he suffer? Are you kidding? They suffered. Are you going to Hyneria? He wanted you to have this. I had toyed with Slim Pickens on the bomb. But this feels far more appropriate to the moment. Don't you think? Now that Einstein has removed all wormhole weapon knowledge, my purpose is fulfilled. We've done everything we can together, John. Somehow you'll have to make all your future decisions on your own. My eradication program has begun to remove all vestiges of me. Soon... I'll be nothing but a pleasant remembrance... of the good old days. Good-bye, John. Thanks for your memories. You did it, John. There's no more dying. You know, it's strange. It almost took me losing this little one to fully understand motherhood. And I love it. And all of a sudden three is not such a scary number. Here we go. But no matter how wonderful this is, I will not accept it as a trade-off for losing you. What are you doing here? Did I scare you? 'Cause you scared me. Crichton's don't cry... often... or for very long. Where's your mother? That's it, open your eyes. You see all these stars? They're yours. Except that one. That one's yours. Hi. Let's do this. There you go. Come here, buddy. Yep. Your father and I want you to have the name that means courage and strength. So we have chosen Little D, we don't know what life has in store for you, but whatever it is, you'll figure something out. But you will never walk alone. And God willing, you'll never know war. Instead... Come here. Your mother was right. Your mother is always right. Get used to that. You ready? This is your playground.
