I wanna hear the announce. We'll take the announcement. Tally? Testing one, two, three. This is Tom Orr. Testing one, two, three. You know those faces, you remember those stories. They were the men and women who made I.B.S. News... Okay, that's enough on Tom Orr. Let's go to Tally. Hey, kill the music, guys.

What we in the news business can never forget... is we're only as good as the stories we tell. Guys, you still got the shadow. A little more fill, please. If you could talk a little about how you got started. A few bio-bites. Let's see. I guess I always pretty much knew what I wanted to do. Sallyanne knew what she wanted. And what she wanted was to be number 1. - In neon lights. - The sister comes down to two bites. There's something cute about how you got started. You went to college? I tempted, waited tables. The minute I was old enough, I dealt craps. I wanted deal baccarat, because you could make more money on tips. But where we were living, in a little mining town in the West... you had to be connected to deal baccarat. And the only person I was connected to was my little sister, Luanne. I was going to community college at night... doubling up on communications courses, making up for lost time. Everyone said... "You wanna get a job in television... you have to make a demo tape." So, I made a demo tape. You might ask, "Out of the thousands of women that send tapes, why hire Sally?" I sent it to thirty-seven stations. W.M.I.A. Miami... was the only answer I got. So I said I said good-bye to Luanne and got... on the American connection to Dallas with a four hour lay-over to Miami. I wanted it to be four days, I was so scared of getting there. So, you're Sally. - Thally Atwater. - That's Sally with an "S", right? - Do you thing Im overdressed? - No. Not in the least. I didn't know if it'd be... you know dressy or... cool... Warren? Ms. Atwater is here. Okay, go up those stairs and Warren's in the control booth. - Hey. I'm Ned. - I'm Sally. You majored in communications. Yeah, Vic, listen.

Do not call her "sweetheart." - There's got a kid trapped. - No kid. Dad, Mom, Grandma in one car. The driver, his wife or girlfriend in the pickup. - There's some discrepancy there. - Run that discrepancy by me. Lady calls, says the woman in the pickup was her "husband's whore." Warren? Trish again on two. Trish? Yeah, we'll send you references. Weren't you and Trish... You know, if you don't mind my asking? - I do mind. Who you got on Homestead? - Nobody. Unless you unfired Trish. We don't usually wear out credentials in the newsroom. Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, that's good. - I'm sorry. I'm from Nevada. Okay, here's the rundown. - We'll have the kid hostage story live. - No. It'll be "What-does-it-all-mean?" Have Lou do it. Consuela's doing the P.B.A. Endorsing the mayor for second term. Bury that before the first commercial. Harvey's doing Anders, and there's the Coco Plum housekeeper killing. Lead with that. Because... Come on. Let's have it. The golden rule of local news. "If... it... bleeds, it leads." - Your predecessor... - Trish... Trish didn't think the desk had a whole lot to teach her. How 'bout you? - I think the desk can teach me. - What? - Everything. - Everything? So... that later when I'm... So when I'm ready, I'll be able to do a story. Excuse me a second. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This is a great honor... ...already a seasoned newswoman. She covered crucial... Crucial California Youth Forum Elections? You might ask, "Out of the thousands of women that send tapes, why hire Sally?" Because I'm Sally, and I'm going to be a star. If it is to tell me I have a lot to learn, I already know that. - I'm going to learn it. - Noted. Meanwhile, you answer the phones, work the data-base... get the reporters what they need... addresses, numbers. Who, what, when, where. And you see that Mister Coffee machine over there? I like it strong. Lleana, cancel my dinner. We're gonna have to go late. You used to cover the White House. - You'll tell me you watched me? - You asked George Bush how... as former C.I.A. Director, he didn't know Noriega was on the C.I.A. Payroll. Bush said, "No questions at photo op." And you put the whole thing on the air. - It was in a course I took. - You still get the coffee. - I could probably get the coffee. - Good. Otherwise you'd just have the shortest career in W.M.I.A. Channel Nine History. News Heartbeat of the American Riviera. Sugar, no cream. You always wear that much makeup? Turning to the weather front, looks like scorchers stacked up over Florida. Newsroom. May I have your name, please? And what is the name of the hospital? Does this person have a name? No, I am trying to help you. No, ma'am. I do not remember Miami before there were Haitians. Thank you, ma'am. Happy Halloween to you, too. - You're getting' the hang of it. I am, yes. Actually, I've been getting the hang of it since at least July. - Here you go, Warren. - Thanks. Good, Ned. This is not a criticism, it's more of an observation. - You don't have a weather person. - I fired her. I don't like it. But having the anchor do the weather reduces his credibility as anchor. - Credibility? Rob? - If you wanted someone to do it... ...you think you might be ready to... ...take in a little more... ...responsibility? - Exactly. I'm already. You know what you are ready for? You can stop tomorrow morning on your way in. My cleaning. Shun Lee. You want a ride home? Otherwise I've just had the shortest career in the History of W.M.I. A... - News Heartbeat of American Riviera. - The ride home is optional. I opt no, thank you. - You want Rob to wear that? - You know, weather is sponsored spot. What if it's not raining, Dan? Any other costume ideas on tap? I was thinking maybe big sunglasses if... Shit. Warren, Three has happy weather. Three? The night the Gulf War started... they led with a Bal Harbour Winter Wonderland Shopathon. And Three is the top-rated station in this market. What could it cost to try? - It would could cost you nothing. - Give me a second. - I said I wanted them boxed. - They still don't come boxed. - I was watching the news last night... - Is that unusual? ...and I have an idea about something. I was rethinking the weather spot. Yeah, everybody is. I could do the desk and the weather... ...same salary. - If I could restate my point... - I got it. Salary to one side, Sally. - I did some weather in Reno. I wanted to hire regular weather, an Arnie Poole type. San Francisco's got Arnie Poole. We've got Rob. - All I ask to let Rob try this. - The weather in Reno. Let's see. They must get some genuine weather there, huh? - Oh, big time. - You prove me wrong, I'm easy. Dan... meet our new weather person. Really? Really? This is Dan Duarte, our station manager and my boss. I go through life with a smile, try to spread a little goodness. You know, some people in this business get jaded because... it's always the same awful stories. And it is the same stories. But they're happening to different people. Our new weather gal seems to be under the weather. Thirty seconds, Rob. Focus on spreading that goodness, Rob. What is this? Okay, come on. Let's get up. - Now, what is it? - Oh, I can't do it. Now, you've done this before. If you're Sally, I want you in makeup now, please. Not now. Wait outside. - Say, "Sally Atwater." Say it. - Thally. Thally. - Say it. - Thally Atw... - No, I can't do it! - Then don't do. You don't have to do it. - Yes, I do. - What? - Yes, I do. - Okay. I'll get you through it. I'm your floor manager. You're gonna be on camera two the entire time. Okay, everybody, happy weather! In fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve... Okay, everybody... Keep on your toes. Let's do this one for Uncle Dan. Rob, check the prompter. And now with the weather, here's Sa... Tally Atwater. Tally? It's your new name. It's easy to say. don't look at me, look at the camera. You got twenty-nine seconds to commercial. Talk straight into the red light. You will find you've got a new best friend. Tally? Come on, baby. Thanks, Rob. How long was that? Okay, we need to lake thirty seconds off the close. What an idea. We will want these, because it's heat, heat and more heat. Oh, another good idea, Dan. We're looking at an expected high of ninety-eight. - Sunglasses don't look silly on Seven. - Will she come out next with a banana? When the sun goes down, look for a balmy low of eighty-six. - Pick it up. - More high pressure moving in means... Pace yourself. don't look at me. Look at the camera. And so the five-day forecast is more... ...more, more hot, hot, hot. Thtay... Stay inside, cuddle up and enjoy the air conditioning. Rob. You made your point, Warren. This is a non-starter. She eats the lens. This is Rob Sullivan saying, for Adela Syms and myself... and all of us here at Channel Nine News good night. Be of good cheer. Won't want this. Will need these. Not to worry, Dan. Uncle Rob was there to step in if it got any worse. - Good job, Sally. - I was betting she'd pee on air. - I've never seen anything like it. - We'll do it again tomorrow, okay? You don't have to put up with him, Lu. Luanne, I hear it. I hear it. No, it is not the guy from the sweepstakes. Nobody but you believes in the guy from sweepstakes. It's like the tooth fairy. Wait, don't hang up! I wanna talk to you. - You're feeling sorry for yourself? - What are you doing here? N.B.C.'s million dollar baby and how she got there. No Miami Herald, no Washington Post, no Wall Street Journal? You getting a cheap rush from this? You know the demo tape I sent you? I faked it. I didn't do any of those things. I went to East Reno Community College. I wasn't valedictorian. I didn't graduate. I rented a cap and gown. I did the camera myself. I even threw the confetti myself. No crucial California Youth Forum Elections? Big time weather? Once when I was working at... Cal-Neva, there, it got snowed in. And a Reno station asked for some report... phone reports, and I did one. It was forty seconds long. - I know all that. I checked it out. - So, fire me. If you're hungry enough to fake it, you might be hungry enough to do it. - The weather is not gonna work. - You don't think I know that? You come across on camera. I'm giving you a shot as reporter. That's what I came by to tell you. You thought I came by to fuck you, didn't you? Lu! I think I just got promoted. Actually, this is a set-aside. Harvey's Belle Glade piece tells me a story. Yours doesn't. Miami's beautiful people got an eyeful today... - What's the story? - The story is... The fashion industry comes to South Beach. It came. It went. We did that story. It's gone. Now let's lay in B roll and see if we can't salvage this thing. Some of the finest cigar makers exiled from Cuba... are making profitable businesses here in Little Havana. As I quickly learned, it's not as easy as it looks. What's the story here? Is it the Cuban? Or are you getting cute with the cigar? This is Tally Atwater, Channel Nine News, in Little Havana. The Cuban, of course. Then you should've found out that this particular exiled cigar maker... is not from Havana, but a Batista officer. - Just do it better. - Right. Harvey's truck is down. On his way to... How long would it take us to get to Miami Beach? I thought we're doing this bullshit boat show. - This' a much better story. How long? - Half an hour. Vic... Yeah, Tally. Listen, Ned and I are moments from this Harvey story. - Harvey's truck is down. - I'm covering till he gets here. But if he doesn't get here you'll need an on-camera reporter. You've never done a live feed. You don't even know what the story is. Get the boat, get the cable, get the balconies. Get the spokesman. Then tell me what the story is. Okay, show me what you got. Get in there. Jam the damn mike in his face. Hey, wait a minute! - We have to make a positive I.D. First. - How do you do that, Sheriff? - Metro-Dade, missy. - How do you make a positive I.D.? I know she's never done a live feed. So, if she can't cut it, I'll do it. - We can call this one Juan Doe. - His name is Juan Doe? Or is that your way of suggesting that this particular John Doe... or unidentified person, or was Spanish speaking? Cute, missy. I'm gonna ask y'all to bear with us and be patient here. - First thing, stay upwind. - Which way is upwind? Away from the sting. Floaters stink because their stomach's full of gas. That's what brings them up. Sometimes they pop. We can shoot right here. But they're over there... Raul Sota, Domingo Katz. Colombians. Deck hands on the S.S. Bolivar out of Barranquilla. They jumped ship. I called the harbor master. Calling the harbor master what reporters do. - Raul Sota and Domingo Katz. - We're still too close. The storm that slammed into Miami yesterday... Forget yesterday. Yesterday's history. News happens today. - Forget yesterday. Today, okay. - Shoulder facing camera so Ned can... - I'm gonna faint. Where's upwind? - Not where you're at. Vic? Are you with me? How much time have we got? A minute and twelve seconds to come up with the lead-in, okay? This isn't about lipstick. This is about them. Two guys jumped ship... for the land of plenty, and they drown 25 feet from getting it. People like Sota and Katz don't get taught how to swim. That's what this story's about, not makeup. Vic? One minute. - In the blue water off Miami today... - Miami Beach today. Raul Sota, Domingo Katz. What did they die for? What did they want? In the blue water off Miami Beach today, divers... Hold the divers. Lead with Sota and Katz. I'll tell you what to say. - I know what to say. - Well, then say it! Raul Sota and Domingo Ka... 25 feet from the big enchilada. 25 feet from the promise land. 25 feet from walking down Colliens Avenue and a job bussing dishes. - Did you want something that bad? - Ten seconds. - Answer me. Do you? - Yes! - Then show me. - She's on in seven seconds. Six. - Tell me a story. - Five. Four. Three... Two men drowned today off Miami Beach. Raul Sota and Domingo Katz... didn't belong in the luxurious cabanas that line this beach. They jumped ship. They wanted to come to America. And they died... 25 feet from what they must have seen as the promised land. Were these men seeking asylum? All we know is that a pilgrimage... to El Norte that began in Barranquilla, Columbia... spelled death today for Raul Sota and Domingo Katz. This is Tally Atwater on Miami Beach. Girl's got chops. Thank you. I was wondering if you could say that. - It was nice work on the aliens. - Thanks. It made me reflect on how many of them... every day, actually get in. Food for thought. I'd never thought of it that way, Rob. A little advice from Uncle Rob? Watch Warren. Don't let him bring you along too fast. You feel you need a mentor... - Roberino. - Thanks. On tonight's Assignment Earth, "Selling Dirty Air." When Oriana Fallaci interviewed Fidel Castro, she did it in Spanish. Before you set up your one-on-one with Fidel... you might wanna get a new jacket, or two. We have a consultant that we use, Inez Cifuentes. We have a budget for it. We don't want the look to get in the way. Warren said to keep a little edge. It's a when-did-you-stop-beating- your-wife kind of deal. Diaz isn't doing to admit he's taking money from Cali. If you can get him not answering the question, then you've told the story. Another thing, if... Well, that's nice. Edgy enough for you? Inez, you can do something about the hair? I'm not cutting my hair. Ned, run, get ahead of me. Excuse me. Toda la familia... How do you answer allegations that you profited from drug money? That is no longer an issue. Isn't it true that your campaign received sizable contributions... Do you have vaginal or clitoral orgasms? Isn't it true you prefer fellatio although you're a practicing lesbian? Would you like to clear up these allegations? Tell him I got the mother of the sex-change boy. Because Donahe has the sex-change boy. I know she's a second-tier get. I also she's available. 200 years of a free press and we've down to the sex-change boy? There's nothing big here. Just get me into Havana on Thursday. Three, two, one. Behind those smoked glass windows in downtown Miami today... I bet that one's yours. - You win. - Got it? Asshole Diaz. Tally Atwater, Joanna Kennelly. Joanna's my ex-wife. Well, one of them. The one that left me in Washington, not in New Orleans. - Joanna's on her way to Havana. - Why don't you come with me? - Do you expect to talk to Diaz? - Let me show the beauty of news. - I wanted to get him on camera. I did. - Of course you did. Get plenty of ambient noise, okay? And balloons. - How would you do it? - Oh, perfectly. I love balloons. - Here, look at this. - Congressman! Is it true you prefer fellatio? Watch this. And you dissolve from the window... to you, like this. And then... I'm gonna lay in the sound. Behind those smoked glass windows in downtown Miami today... is Congressman Jorge Diaz... So... - You and Joanna... - Joanna... thought I was a Capitol Hill insider, which, at the time, I was. We were a cute couple on the Sunday shows for a while. But being around in the morning isn't my long suit. So, you got your questions... you got your ambient noise at the rally. I don't imagine it's your long suit either. Maybe not. So we keep it loose... and we keep it open. And if we get lucky... gold. Okay, here you go. You and Joanna have any children? - No. Iris and I had... - Iris? My first wife. We had a little girl. She lived a week. Eight days. You have family? - My sister. - You close? I raised her, after my mother died. Our mom totaled the car on Mount Rose Highway. She always wanted to sing in a lounge, but she never did. She had this whole Patti Page set. She was okay. Look... I've been here before. So have I. Newsroom. Just a minute. - For you. - For me? This is Tally. I'll call you when I get home. - I need to take a few days off. - Something wrong? - No, nothing's wrong. - But you have to take some days off. It's personal, okay? Lt's okay. It's gonna be all right, Luanne. I'll get the money. I'm here. It's not about economic chaos or political uncertainty. - Today at six, The Channel Nine... - About that Omega Seven story. The Omega Seven parole hearing? Let Steve do it. And if Tally's back tomorrow, she can do an action wrap-up. I wouldn't count on that. You want me to get Accounting to wire her the cash advance? No, I'll take care of it. Tell Dan I hear Arnie Pooles contract's up in San Francisco. And I just might get him a new weatherman. One seventy-five. It's not my problem if her boyfriend skips out on her and steals her money. - I want the rent now. - I'll get it to you tomorrow. I need it in full. I told her that, or else I gotta get the marshal in. - I'll get the rest of it tomorrow. - Tomorrow's today. Pay up or out. How much? - What are you doing here? - I'm on my way to San Francisco... to buy Dan some happy weather. How much? She's five fifty short. The extra goes on account. Let's go. Did you interview you any celebrities, Sallyanne? Come on. - You get a rush out of humiliating me! - I didn't come here for a rush. - The what did you come here for? - I had a hunch. You had a hunch you'd walk in here and get the story on me and my sister. I have no interest in your sister. I just met her a few minutes ago. Why don't you get her in depth? Washing her underwear in the sink? Look, you asked for cash, I provided it. Over and out. You provided it? What exactly do you take me for? - Wait a minute. - You come here and spreads bills... around like you picked me up in some bar, in front of that asshole! - You have no business here! - Hold on. You work for me. You announce you're taking off, forget about the part, if it's okay for me... shoot off a fax demanding cash. And you figured you'd do me this big favor and Id owe you. - Well, that was my mistake. - Every girl I grew up with... - ended up thinking she owed some guy. - This doesn't interest me. I was gonna get us out of here. I told Luanne, "We'll get an apartment on the Upper West Side"... because I read some magazine that said Diane Sawyer lived there. I didn't know the upper side west side of what. I just knew... I had to get us there. That's what happens. Some guy comes along and no more Upper West Side. - Does that interest you? - That interests me. I need another couple of days... to make sure she's all right. If that's okay with you. It's perfectly okay with me. This is the final boarding call for flight 804 to San Francisco. All remaining passengers should board now. - So, take as long as you need. - I didn't want you to see any of this. So what? He completely ignored the fact that this is a society divided by fear... ...hatred and violence. - Not true. We haven't discussed... "Promises and pie crust are made to be broken, "Jonathan Swift once said. And the President's environmental package resembles cherry pie crust. South Vietnamese planes struck the wrong target here today. Their own village. Napalm burned civilians running for their lives. Here's what we don't know, on this day where over 200 US Marines were killed. With the death toll still rising. There was no perimeter defense set up that might've stopped the bomber. We don't know what roll these Marines were supposed to play here... why they were even here. And so, at the end of this terrible day... what we do know is that over 200 Marines died without knowing why. This is Warren Justice, I.B.S. News, Beirut, Lebanon. Warren Justice stepped down today as Chief White House Correspondent. An award-winning journalist, Justice has been a prominent figure at IBS... So, what's is it like working at the network? You think you'll get to the network and look back at everybody that made... you eat it and say, "Up yours." But it's not like that. - What is it like? - It's hard. It's fun. - Then why did you leave? - It stopped being fun. Tell me about these dumb contests you used to enter with Tawney Buchner. - Why don't you tell me why... - How about the contests? The contests. Miss Stateline, Miss Truckee, Miss Tahoe, Miss Sierra Logger. - I'll tell you a secret. - Id keep Sierra Logger a secret. No. The secret is, in not one of them did I finish in the top five. So, what's you do for talent? Did you by chance sing, "Feelings"? No. For your information, I did not by any chance sing "Feelings." To dream the impossible dream To fight the unbeatable foe To bear the unbearable sorrow To run where the brave dare not go To right the unrightable wrong To love pure and chaste from afar To try when your arms are too weary To reach The unreachable star This is my quest To follow that star - Phone sex is on the rise. - Yeah? Warren won't touch that. - Alaskan wolves. - As in the slaughter of? We have tape of a wolf caught in a trap. You got tape on that? Run it at six. Metro-Dade reports tourist robbery complaints are up eight percent. It's a story this town's talking about. Correction. It's not a story his town wants to talk about. I don't think Tally's her pulse on the finger of the community the way I do. I think you mean finger on the pulse of the community, Rob. Anyway let's get people talking about it. Harvey, you get into that. It's your first step towards the Peabody Award. Somebody makes me happy. Wait! Here's a cross-dresser from Tallahassee who gets all the... to the finals in Miss Florida contest. - Boring. - Tally, maybe you wanna handle that. - You'd do a real in depth piece on it. - I think I'll pass. Think, "Cross-dresser from Tallahassee who dreams the impossible dream. You cannot be trusted. Okay, anything else? - So, this is where I live. - It's... - What? - 502, vehicle registered to... Skylight Limo. - You keep this on all the time? - I find it soothing. The sound of human iniquity. You know what a 502 is? D.W.I., driving while intoxicated. Skylight Limo's the one the rockers use. Probably a drug bust. Controlled substances. Tally Atwater reporting live. You better get going. The night we did the Diaz story, in the editing room... I didn't know you then. I'm not gonna be the guy that goes, "No more Upper West Side." So? First on the scene? One-on-one with the lead guitar? Isn't that what you want? What do you want? I knew you'd go. This is Tally Atwater saying Happy New Year form W.M.I.A. Channel Nine... News Heartbeat of the American Riviera. You give us thirty minutes, and we give you Miami. Yel mundo. - We're back in Times Square... - Have you ever met Bucky Terranova? Agents are for babes, Tal, not for grunts. He's coming Miami next week for a panel. So is Joanna Kennelly. Tally, you and Warren... you guys aren't having a... you know... thing, are you? That's what I thought. The usual deal is somebody ends up crying. Nobody is going to end up crying. And it's usually not Warren. Happy New Year to all of you! Okay, you got the baby? Oye... you got me, okay? Fernando, you were convicted in July of armed robbery... - your third felony conviction. - No... fourth. So you get free baby clothes, toys, diaper service for a year, all for... - what are you calling the baby? - Fernandito. And so, Fernando Buttanda heads north for Holmesburg Prison... leaving behind wife, Augustina, and their five children in Cuba. - Here's something from the booth. - And Rosario Mota... who at 12:02 this morning, gave birth to Fernando, Junior... Miami's first baby of the new year. - Sad story, Tally. - It is, Rob. One with a New Year's twist. I was just informed that the local... merchants association decided that because of the unusual circumstances... the first-born layette should be awarded instead to Tiffany Policek. Very nice. - You might've cleared this with me. - Back to the two-shot. Tiffany was the second. The layette was supposed to go to the first-born. Well, I think I see the merchant's point, Tally. - I'm not surprised you do, Rob. - Happy New Year. Go to commercial. No go. It's thirty seconds till the credits. Buttanda is an habitual offender. The woman has 2 children out of wedlock. - After all, what? - Guys, cut it out. - I don't think we need to go into that. - You got two cameras on 'em. - Get one on something else. - What else is there? Lt's a runaway train. In the spirit of the new year and the whole idea of first-born... I'm sure W.M.I.A. would be delighted to... honor Miami's true first-born, Fernandito Buttanda. - She can't do that. - She just did. - Fifteen seconds to credits. - That's all. I'm Rob Sullivan. Tally will surely join me in saying, "Be of good cheer. And Happy New Year from all of us on the Channel Nine News Team." Go. Matte it. We gotta hold this for fifteen. Fill in mikes. - This the last time you sit here. - I didn't know you'd been appointed... - Commissar of Public Morality. - He's a criminal and she's a whore. Well, only whores have babies out of wedlock? - Warren, your protge is out of line. - Protge? Does that mean whore, too? Tally, shut up and smile. Rob, we're still on air. Keep smiling. - Warren, we've gotta talk. - She doesn't have the maturity. - You're pushing her too fast. - Your protge doesn't have maturity. If you think that pompadour gives you maturity, you need professional help. That's enough, Tally. Rob, handling the unexpected is what we call television. - She has no right... - To what? Tell the truth? Or change copy to something safe? She's off reservation. And it's up to you to go... To what? Rope her in? Cut her down to size? What size do you want? Your size? Warren, I'm warning you. - That's a wrap. Thank you. - This is unbelievable! Childish and amateurish behavior. They would've fired her in Saint Louis. - Right, Rob, though shop, Saint Louis. - I'm taking this to Dan! If you don't, I will. Listen, next time you want to embarrass the station, quit first. - You want me to quit? - Yeah, that's what I want. You don't go around changing station policy on air! - I'm the one who has to... - This is a team! But I'm not part of the team, am I? I'll always be written off as the News Director's protge. So, fine! I'm capable of finding a job where I am nobody's protge. Feliz ao nuevo. You're right. My sister has a baby. Her live-in has a record. That make her a whore? - Right again. - He's just stupid. He's an anchor. - Mister Terranova, one photo, please. - Joanna Kennelly? - Mister Terranova? - Tally? Joanna Kennelly. We've met before. Hi. - Have you know Bucky for long? - No, I don't actually know him. But you want to. Bucky, come here. Tally Atwater, Mister Bucky Terranova. "News Heartbeat of the American Riviera. You give us thirty minutes, we'll give you... el mundo"? I was wondering when you'd walk into my life. Oh, please. I'm gonna need a suite at the Wilshire and a floor pass at the Forum. Just tell' em it's for the day that the Lakers play the Phoenix... - Suns. - Suns. No, I'll call you back. "Sex and Drugs: The Downside of Basketball's Instant Millionaires. - A Joanna Kennelly in-depth Report." - Those millionaires will love you. You still got a nice ass. But it's not this year's ass, is it? Not even last year's. I am seven years and three dozen asses back. The next time I see you... it'll be four dozen. Unless you're gonna tell me this one's different. Wait a minute. - Has somebody finally got to you? - This is not what you think. Just good friends. That is novel. What's it feel like? It feels good. You gonna go with her when she makes her move? You need a year or two in a major market. Preferably at an O and O. What's your feeling about Philadelphia? A large city in Pennsylvania. I can put you there. - It's a number four market. - It's do-able. They're looking for a fresh face. Lucky timing. Your vice is full of money. Anybody ever tell you that? - I was having... - I know. I know where you're going. I bet he said your voice was full of money. That's what he always says. He's famous for it. He even said that to Joanna. It's actually not even his line. It's from a novel. "Her voice was full of money. That was the inexhaustible charm... that rose and fell in it." Hemingway, right? F. Scott Fitzgerald. Cheap shot. It's the right move. Nobody ever called Bucky dumb. I guess it's even the right time. We had some fun, you and I. didn't we? What is it you want? - You know what I want. - You wanna go to Philadelphia. So, he says to me... "If you need a mentor... Roberino." Roberino? Will do me a favor? don't ever say that again. You could come with me. First prize: A week in Philadelphia. Second prize: Two weeks. It's an old joke. - Ive already been where you're going. - You could go back. - Why not? - I already told you. All you told me is that it stopped being fun. It was a good run while it lasted. Then I made a mistake. What kind of mistake? I had and trusted a source. I went with the story and I got burned. The source did what sources do. I missed the signals. You're allowed to make a mistake once in a while. Not really. If you chose not to play on the team... you can't afford mistakes. Why didn't we do this before? Because it was always gonna be this hard to stop. You know, we have some time before you go. I don't wanna go. Sure you do. You know something? I never got a... What've you got here? For me? Miss Sierra Logger. Okay. You better go. Go. Up next, shocking new information about a nursing home sex scandal. Stay with us. We'll back in a moment. John, whoever wrote that copy about the nursing home should be fired. It's silly, it's wrong, and I won't say it. Then wing it. You're up to speed on this story. A real warhorse, Marcia. We'd get together for a drink so you two kids could get to know each other. Sure. Would you mind having your guest move? She's in my eye line. - I'm sorry. - Oh, here we go again. John, have you any idea how little coverage... we actually devote to substantive discussion of public policy? You an issues wonk, too, Tally? - I agree it's an important point. - What is? The need for substant... Bucky told me. - Bucky? Bucky who? - Bucky Terranova, my agent... said that Tom Orr told him... - Tom? You know Tom? - Well, not exactly. But... Tom is just about the worst offender. Well, I have two charity auctions to attend tonight. Is that actually a banana daiquiri? Spring break, Lauderdale. Good night, Tally. - Ready, B.T. One. - Time again for 90 Years Young. Today we're blessed with twins. Roxy and Ruby Temple down in South Kendall at the Clearview Home. - It's a cute segment. - What's cute about it, Dan? ...long life to the active things they did in their younger days. Is it cute to be nice to people just because they are older than you? Will it be cute when you're 98, fighting to hang on to your dignity... and there's Rob Sullivan out of the blue with some cheap birthday cake... - calling you a beautiful youngster? - I don't wanna argue about this. There are people fighting out there for this spot! And any time I have a spot that advertisers are willing to fight for... then this is a good spot. Is that how we're programming news? Asking the advertisers what they want? Say an advertiser wants a laugh-track. What about that, Dan? No problema? - Like it or not, this is a business. - Yeah, it's a business. The entertainment business. The hell with the news and with the truth. - Where have all the good times gone? - Philadelphia. Off this ambulance drivers' strike, we'd get into the crisis in emergency... Emergency rooms are so crowded, hospitals are turning ambulances away. They don't have the beds. - What hospitals, Tally? - County General, for one. Queen of Angels? Saint Matthews? How many hospitals? You said hospitals, plural. Which hospitals? When? How many people turned away? Why? I have a call in to the Paramedics Association. When you have the statistics, you should reintroduce. Shall we move on? If you could find him, Lleana, I only have a minute. I saw on the weather channel it's ninety-five there. Actually I just didn't wanna forget what your voice sounded like. No, I haven't forgotten what you look like. Stop right there. We have to feed. I miss you too. Rape has become an ugly fact of life in Philadelphia. And in just a moment, we'll be hearing Tally Atwater on that subject. Some statistics may convey the idea, Marcia. According to recent studies, the median age of men who commit rape... in Philadelphia, is twenty-three. Half have a prior arrest record. Nine percent of these had been previously arrested for rape. Sobering. But don't you think, Tally, that statistics can seem... in the face of real human outrage, worse than irrelevant? Right, Marcia. Coming up next, Bernie Plant, with the weather. You want some coffee or something? Well, I thought I owed you a talk. We've got these marketing consultants. They run focus groups. They invite... 20 citizens in for cold cuts, see what they like and don't like. I thought it might be constructive to know what they had to say about Tally. Very helpful, John. I don't like her. I hit the refrigerator when she comes on. - She looks like... ...a bush league Marcia. If you ask me, it's her hair. Why is it women always go with the hair? - Hair is character. - Nobody from nowhere. Well, that's enough of that. Tally, I hired you. You have real potential. But there's a feeling that you're not making... - Contact. - Right. I wanna leave this on a positive note. What you ought to do is talk to the consultants who run these deals. And just see what they have to say. Okay? Is something up? Anything wrong? No reason at all. I just... Why should anything wrong? I'm so busy. And I just hit a break. You busy? You hit a brake? - Well, I saw these consultants. - Consultants on what? - I had a makeover. - A makeover? What do you mean a... It seems that I was a little too edgy for Philly. Marcia couldn't be nicer. - She's a super girl. - Super? Marcia McGrath? Tal... you okay? Anything I can do? No, everything's great. It's just that I... It's just that I... I... wanted to say hi. You wanna say hi again, I'm here. Habla inglese? - Bucky Terranova. - So, Warren, how long has it been? R.F.K. Stadium, owner's box, Redskins-Giants. I wanted to leave Washington. You said, I didn't handle people on the way down. So, what brings you to Miami? - Stone crab? - Try again. The fact is, Warren, I have a client in a certain amount of distress. A client with whom you have a special relationship. And it occurred to me, you might want to be up there for a period of time. - Last I heard, I still had a job here. - I see that it keeps you very busy. What if I can arrange a leave? Wait a minute. I'm seeing daylight on this. I bring Mel Casey from Atlanta to sub for you. He's got a young wife, only wants the spot jobs. But it's his life. You've already laid this on Dan, haven't you? You two could use a timeout. This isn't about you and me. She's in trouble. Think it over. What's up? I was just wishing I was driving down the Keys with you... and we were already picking up Havana on the radio. - How long can you stay? - Long enough. Oh, hey, what the... - John, long time, no see. - Warren? John and I covered the D.E.A. Together in New Orleans. I just left my appointment book here. And I'm on my way. - I didn't think you were coming back. - I think he figured out, Tal. Tally, Warren. Fabian, here you are, back home in the town where you were discovered... Everybody loved that piece. We got a huge response. I mean, considering... How about that guy who chose to murder that woman? That was a terrific idea. It just wasn't... It wasn't quite executed... You and your children have been here for seven weeks now. I was... I was really off that day. But there is some good stuff with her children. - I... I... - The S.R. O Housing Corporation... of course being the city agency responsible... - You didn't get to the children. - I don't need to. - No, but it's good. - It's shit. - It was what? - It was all shit. Why she was in the hospital? Why couldn't she get her kids back? Did you listen to one word that woman was saying? Or were you too busy worrying about impressing the viewers? Who the hell is this? What the hell happened to you? - Where's Tally Atwater? - You tell me. You invented her! Well, I did one lousy job! You come, take one look at Marcia and you fold. If I was into inventing... - Id have invented somebody tougher. I'm exactly the way you made me. Do it this way! Do it that way! I don't even know how to do it without you. Bullshit. I dressed you, I pointed you toward the camera, but you did it. You told the story. You know how to do it. You're gonna doing it on your own. - I can't. - Look at this. - The network... - don't even talk... ...twenty million people are gonna be depending on you. - I don't care. - Before they trust you they've to... know you're listening to them! To do that, you must know who you are! You see? It's not all Marcia McGrath country up here. So, give them Tally Atwater. When I asked you how long you could stay and you said, "Long enough"... how long is that? - When we're not together... ...everything shuts down. As Councilman, you were influential in securing the permits and waivers... that allowed Patriot Hill to begin construction. Yes, I cut through some of the red tape for the developers. When Patriot Hill was still called Dog Bottom... these same developers bought up the neighborhood for dog bottom prices. - They also are in business. - Big business, from what I understand. Evacuations continue at the Holly Ball, the scene of a suspicious fire. - Tally, what's the latest? - Whether the chandelier went down... before or after 9-1-1 got called nobody is saying. But this has to be one of the most incendiary affairs of... what social register types here call "The Season." The Holly Ball is one of our prettiest and most traditional events. How do you suppose such a thing happened? A kid with too much time and nothing to do with it. Bored silly. And dressed to kill. - Is that your opinion, Tally? - No, that is observable fact. - Thank you, Tally. - Bucky. Right, she is looking good. Id like to sit down with you sometime this week. So, the ratings are up. The research says it's Tally. I owe you one. I hadn't factored she was gonna need her hand held. You make your living off of people that need their hands held. - She can go all the way, can't she? - Assuming she doesn't go wiggy again? Does a first-rate job, makes a few breaks for herself. I.B.S. is the shot. Unless Wendy Chan shows more than she's been showing'. - How long? - A year, two years, eighteen months. Timeout to decode. You up for the duration? No comment, read yes. Miami know this? Dan and I don't put each other on speed dial. If Dan hears you're even thinking, you've seen your last moon over Miami. From the point of view of the guys, you don't exactly read user-friendly. - You left too much scorched earth. - What is this, Bucky? Tough love? Try Pete Raymond. The last time I saw Pete Raymond... I told Id be interested in watching him cover his own retirement. That's funny. But you see the problem. I got it. I didn't mention to Tally I was seeing you today. Still doing it your way, I see. Tell Merino if he wants to keep her happy, there's a cameraman in Miami. He's a good man. - What are you doing here? - Old Warren pulled a few strings. - Really? - That's right. Hell of a temptation, Warren, having you back on the market. Never though you'd leave Miami. But, end of the day, you're a hard news guy. - We did a five-parter on nannies. - Five-parter on nannies. - Right off the charts, response-wise. - That right? Okay, you don't do nannies. You don't take prisoners. You ought to pitch somebody you don't have a history with. There's a hot young kid at Four in Baltimore. Cord Otavio. Hold all my calls. So, tell me something about yourself... Warren. You first, Cord. I talked to Bucky today, mentioned your being here. He already knew it. Asked how you were. So, how are you? I never thought an eclipse would get to be my idea of a good time. - You know what I wish? - That this eclipse would move faster. I wish you didn't have to go back to Miami. It's Warren Justice calling for Pete Raymond again. Not Mister Warren. Mister Justice. If Mister Raymond doesn't know who I am, he doesn't have to call me back. Another blue heaven morning here at Radio Rock It Sock It Philadelphia. Channel Seven. They got the babe that makes me shout. Talking 'bout Marcia, I am not. Ooh, Tally, what you got? Marcia, you may be overreacting. She takes my broadcast with which I am identified... and for which I am responsible and she makes my broadcast... and by extension, me, the object of vulgar innuendo. The object is not you, it's me. - Lf you wanna talk about the DJ... - Forget about the DJ. We've got an election coming up here. Marcia knows more about politics... than the polls do. So, I offered her Senior Political Correspondent and... Director of Campaign Coverage. I don't know whatever the title she wanted. And she passed. I want you to take over some of her duties. Is that what this is all about? Is she staying? She has an offer in Cincinnati. Anchor. It's nice market for her. You don't use hypo-allergenic? My red twenty-eight. You should use twenty-nine. A quick comb-out and I'm ready to go on air tomorrow night in Cincinnati. Quelle irony. I was offered a job in W.M.I. A this week. Chris Reiss phoned me to come in and co-anchor with Rob Sullivan. - Chris Reiss? - From Chicago. Dynamite news guy. What's he doing at M.I.A.? Getting along with Dan, which is more than Warren ever bothered to do. Miami's a little Chiquita banana for me, but Chris is shaking things up. I actually considered blowing off Cincinnati, streaking my hair... and going down to work with Chris. But, you get to be 42, you know what it costs to jump off high board. You didn't know it was Chris who replaced Warren? - What does it take to jump off? - You beet to be 42, you won't ask. It's not your fault, you know that. It's not anybody's fault. This is the way it works. Actually, I'm forty-four. Not even Bucky knows that. - Been a while, Buford. - Good times. Good times. You're looking for a job, aren't you? Shit, Warren, you got a habit of calling' a horse's ass a horse's ass. We got some folks around that shop just don't appreciate that. You mean like Gabe Lawrence, Vice President of Info-tainment? Yeah, what was it you said about Gabe's Granada coverage? Blood, sweat and Perrier. He never made in invasion. It coincided with a periodontal appointment. The flossers are in charge, now. I'm just a noble, fuckin' savage they trot out to the affiliate meetings. Are your sources at the Pentagon still good? - Think so, why? - You might ask 'em about SOUTHCOM. 1999 we got to give back the Panama Canal. And I can't. See that... happening' without a whole bunch of people running' lot of plays. - This intuition or you hear something'? - The usual people are interested. You got anybody on it? Old Gabe don't think there's a story. You go down there, you'd own it. I kind of wanted to stay around here for a while. She worth it? Deep down, she wants to shoot up the town. - I'm always good for lunch. - You've heard all my stories. - Take care of yourself. - You, too. - Ive been trying to call you all day. - I should tell you, I went up to NY. - To do what? - You should've been up there. There was this street fair, on one of the incredible New York days. - See anybody you know? - All these little kids running' around. - What? - Anything happen up there? I got a cab driver that could find Penn Station. Wait a second now. - Is there something you don't tell me? - You ask a lot of questions. I don't get a lot of answers. Reporters think the job in Washington is cover their bets. Warren didn't. He was there to tell the story, which didn't make him widely popular. Did he ever tell you why he left the network? He said he made a mistake on a story. He trusted the source and he shouldn't have. He trusted the source because I was the source. I took a year off from the bureau to run briefings for State. Warren and I had a deal. I did what I had to do, he did what he had to do. I never dreamed for a minute he'd buy that story. - But he did? - Yeah, he did. In the overall scheme of things, it shouldn't have mattered. But it did... matter because the network was looking for an excuse and now they had one. They saw him as a wild card to begin with. He and Buford Sells had lunch. "Play it the network's way or take the highway." And Warren took the highway. Buford used to be his best friend. So, you see, it took a lot for him to ask Bu for a job. You do a lot for a lot of people. There can't be many who don't owe you. Now you're going to collect one. You're gonna collect it for me. No way! I'm not gonna do it! You do this to me, Terranova! You tell me I gotta hire this guy! I don't have to hire these guys! I worked with Warren for the D.E.A. He almost got me killed. Not now! Whatever is good for the Governor. I'll make myself available. We do a series of backgrounders on the news before it becomes news. The Governor hanging his re-election campaign on prison reform. McBrides up twenty-four points in the polls because... the public thinks cutting inmate privileges is the tough way to go. - We ask questions. - We? You and me. - Why didn't you ask me how I saw it? - Well, how do you see it? You talk to the warden. You talk to the guards. McBride thinks he's being tough? My bet is he's just being butch. The you'll do it? - We could see each other all day long. - You want something, you don't give up. - There's something else I want. - Already got me doing one thing I don't want. What other things you got in mind? Marry me. What? Marry me. I been married. Twice. Bad idea. Twice. I want you around in the morning. You already have me in the morning. How, I don't know, but you do. I wanna know you're legally required to be there. ...with the power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss your bride. Getting the Rotary-lunch speech from the warden won't do it. But if we'd show how McBride's reforms are affecting just one inmate... A Day in the Life, then that would tell the story. - You listening to me or not? - I thought this was our night off. My wife, the candy ass. Did our night off end at midnight? Remember Fernando Buttanda? The father of the New Years baby. Miami. Layette? Rob and I fighting on the air? They sent him up here. To Holmesburg. He's the Day in the Life. Full screen headline: Governor Signs Prison Reform Act. Cut to McBride. Smash into his campaign bites. "Holmesburg is a prison. It's not a resort. Holmesburg works." - We show the jump in the polls. - Then we have this one prisoner... and the effect on him when McBride take out the TV sets and laptops. And also defunded all rehab and vocational training. - What else? - What do you... what else? I just get the sense you may be coming down heavy on McBride. Is it heavy to say that McBride has been pedding nitro to get re-elected? Do I think the crime issue is manipulated for political ends? Yes. - Then what are we talking about? - Do many people wanna hear this? Not necessarily. - John's concern is... - I know what's John's concern is. I think John's feeling is... He wants us to tell the viewers what he thinks they wanna hear. Did you ever entertain any idea you didn't get from a focus group, John? You stake out the moral high ground. Everybody else gets altitude sickness. You think I want this kind of shit? You think I even wanted this project? She wanted it. She's the one who's out there on the line. And the only reason she's out there is to give you something to do! Actually, I've got something to do. You thought he'd show up? He cooled down? Lt's a great story. He's a professional. Inspiring stuff like that? Let's go in and set up. Warren Justice for Colonel Peters. Barry? Long time, right. Are you still covering Panama for the Pentagon? Oye me. I was working in the infirmary all day with... - I don't know how to say, los locos? - The disturbed. And I like it. And then they go and shut down the program. And when they shut down the gym, like they say they're going to do... everybody in here is going to be loco. Disturbed. Actually, I'll be in Washington later today. Maybe we could just... sit down and chew the fat. About this and that. Specifically? I'll call you when I get there. If you need anything more, this TV is light duty, so call me. Thank you so much. You were so helpful. You get over there! They'll let you out? ...all units, especially those in vicinity of Holmesburg Prison. Prisoners took control of the gym and 2 cellblocks. 10 to 12 hostages. ...crew from Channel Seven had been filming when riot broke out. You throw the power, the guards are dead. Stop chicken shitting around. - The Governor doesn't want... - What's he got to do with this? - The Mayor and the Commissioner... - Get the Commissioner on the phone! Anything on the Channel Seven News Crew? Gary Logan, I.B.S. The warden's gonna be briefing me... Warden. Excuse me, Warden. There's a Channel Seven reporter still inside. Is he alive? We won't know until we go in. I'm getting something on the line. It may be Tally trying to feed. - Is Ned shooting this? - Somebody is. Roll a protection copy. Tal? Are you there? Tal, it's me. Are you there? Can you hear me? - Tal, can you hear me? - I hear you! Stay against the wall. Watch your back. Okay, you've got one thing going for you. You've got the camera. Whatever you do, do it on air. It's the only weapon you've got. You're their chance to tell the world what's going on. Use the camera. I'm not on air! They don't know that. Before they do, you will be. Keep it out there. It's going to protect you. Keep it in his face. Who the hell are you? Four, three, two, one! Holmesburg Prison, live. Come on, just say it where it will be heard. - This is Tally Atwater live from... - Tape it. It's not gonna be perfect. First of all, we demand full TV back! - They're feeding. They can see us. - You're now feeding live. We'll try now to go to Tally Atwater for a Channel Seven exclusive report. This is Tally Atwater reporting live in Holmesburg Prison. At approximately four fifteen this afternoon... the whistle sounded that all across this country means, "Guard in Trouble." Can you tell us what precipitated this incident? Okay, Warren, coming back in thirty. Tal, in thirty seconds, you're back on air. There's something happening' in C-block. I'm gonna try and get closer. - How are you doing'? - I'm so tired You know what I keep thinking about? That time you tried to teach me to bone fish in the Keys. - I was really terrible, wasn't I? - Well, you were okay. Ten seconds. Tal, the TAC teams are here. They're taking up positions. As you know, Channel Seven's Tally Atwater... and cameraman, Ned Jackson remain inside Holmesburg Prison... where they have been reporting exclusively... ...for WFIL. - Merino. The Team was inside the prison interviewing inmates for a special... report when the riot broke out. The network wants to go live, national. It's your show. Let's try to go live, once again, to Tally Atwater. What can you tell us? We've been told that tactical assault teams are taking up positions... outside, even as I speak. Should there be an onslaught, prisoners... What the hell? Tal! Can you hear me? - Goddamn it! - What's going on? We lost her. - Warren, what's happening? - Tally, are you there? Do you hear me? We're here in Holmesburg Prison, where the SWAT team has come in. Philadelphia, hang on. New York, what? They don't have audio either. When we do, we'll let you know. If we get it, when we get it, we're gonna go national. That's right. You wanna hold in New York City? Civil rights attorney... prisoner's advocate, Gary Mandinak. Gentlemen, thank you for joining us at this very late hour. - Is it, is it her? - Wait a minute. We got something. - Fernando? - Tal, can you hear me? Open this door! Open it! Open it! Tal, can you hear me? Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm okay. Fernando? Can I talk to you? Question. Are you now saying that you have this situation under control? - Under control. - How is that possible? They're claiming control... ask her about it. Tally, we're getting word that the situation there is under control. You're feeding live, Tal. National. - Well... the inmates have the control. - Which inmates? Or... more accurately one group of inmates has control. This has not been good news for other inmates. Of the 8 men have been killed today, none, repeat none have been guards. One of the eight dead inmates... one was apparently shot by tower guard. The other seven... were victims of continuing racial vendettas here... No more gang shit, Tally. Fernando, how much more time do you have left on your sentence? Ah, madre. I got fifteen months, and then I come up for parole. You know what's going to happen when the guards come in. You'll end up dead. I could end up dead on Biscayne Boulevard. It's two AM. The riot has been underway for close to ten hours. We're back live with W.F.I.L. Philadelphia Tally Atwater... who is inside Holmesburg Prison. Tally's been keeping us informed from her bird's eye view of the riot. - What's the mood? - Describe the scene. Can you, Tally? The mood here, Tom, is ominous. Inmates are prepared... for what they believe will be the final assault. Probably before dawn. - They give indication they'll fight. - Are they armed? Because to fight is a way of life, life learned on the streets. To see the faces inside this prison, is to remember that... on such streets crime is just a way of taking care of business. This is Tally Atwater inside Holmesburg Prison. Get it down? You're watching live footage of the riot at Holmesburg Prison. W.F.I.L. 's Tally Atwater and cameraman, Ned Jackson... are inside the prison, as you see by these... dramatic pictures that we're getting. The TAC team has entered the prison. In the next minutes and hours, the matter will be resolved. Now the question is, how high the price? Can you hear me, Tal? You see anything? I guess... Turn around. don't get shot, guys. Stand by. We've lost Tal. When we get her back, we'll let you know. Twenty-four hours ago, I came to Holmesburg Prison... to report on how Governor George McBride new "get tough" prison policies were affecting one convict. It was meant to be A Day in the Life of Fernando Buttanda. Fernando Buttanda was not a good man by society's standards. He was not even a good man by his own standards. Recently, however, in a job-training program here at Holmesburg... Fernando began to learn nursing skills. He volunteered to work in the prison hospital... at some risk to himself, with violent patients. He was good at it. He liked doing it. A month ago, Governor McBride, who is campaigning for reelection... on the pledge to "reform" other Pennsylvania prisons... as he "reformed" Holmesburg, canceled this program. "A prison is about punishment." He added, "it's not" about another chance." During the next weeks, we'll hear a lot about what prisons should be. A lot opinions as to why this riot occurred, in this place, at this time. Many fixes will be proposed, many answers formulated. Inside Holmesburg Prison last night, answers were harder to come by. What we do know is that fifteen prisoners died... including Fernando Buttanda. This is Tally Atwater, W.F.I.L. News, Holmesburg Prison. Thank you, Tally. And we'll be recapping all of Tally's coverage... You were good. No... you were great. Tally Atwater for Mark Lindner. This is as far as I go. One floor up, the first door on your left. Miss Atwater, I'm Mark Lindner. It's good of you to come and see us. - Would you like coffee, a soft drink? - No, thank you, I'm fine. Karen, you know what call to put through. This is Buford Sells. - How do you do? Lt's a real pleasure. - And Gabe Lawrence. - How are you? - Have a seat. For better or worse, we're the Three Musketeers who run the News Division. That was quite a job you did for us at Holmesburg. Don't get up. - So. - So. - Well, tell me what they said. - Washington Bureau... weekend anchor, evening news. I said Id think about it. - Can I help you? - We'll wait. - Sure. - Weekend anchor? What's to think about? Well, actually what I think is, we make a pretty good team. It's no good that way. We tried. It doesn't work. - We did Holmesburg. It worked. - No, you did Holmesburg. And you did it yourself. And you were terrific. I think there's a story in Panama nobody's telling. I have a hunch that some people would like to see us get into a war... 'cos they're not that enthusiastic about turning over the Canal in 1999. We can do Panama. - Networks aren't interested. - We can make them interested. I can go into Panama City, spend a few days, pick up a local crew... and head out. You already set this up. Yeah. Ive gotta do this by myself. Do you see that? - Wasn't the idea for us to be together? - It was. But it can't be me putting wine on ice while you wrap up the evening news. And it can't be you turning down a story 'cause you don't wanna leave me. Do you wanna be with me? So much that it hurts. I don't wanna be anywhere I can't see you, touch you, hear your voice... or tell you a story, or see this great smile. But I've got a narrow but very definite window of opportunity. And if I can get this... - And if... ...we get lucky... ...gold! - Do you really want this? - You made me want it. Flight 811 to Miami, Belize and Panama... is in its final boarding process. Passengers should be aboard. We haven't had enough time. Every day we have is one day more than we deserve. I'm gonna tell you the best story you've ever heard. Uh, darling? Oh! Been a while since I've done this. Have fun. Stay upwind. ...to explore possible repercussions to our economy. Meanwhile the dollar continued its freefall against the yen and the mark. We'll be discussing this latest run on the dollar tomorrow night... on American Notebook with Treasury Secretary, Willis Barry. This is Tom Orr. I'll see you then. - Tally, how are you? - Go on, sit down, He won't bite. don't get too attached to that chair. You know, I call it home. Have you got the uplink? We're gonna try out a new stringer. Just chat him along. We've got some minutes. Satellite time costs money, boys! Run him out here. Here he is. That has to be the dirtiest excuse for a reporter I have ever seen. My God, it's the anchor person. New hairdo, I'll bet. Shoe shined. Hey, Buford, get the hell outta here. I wanna talk to my wife alone. - Miss me? - Occasionally. When are you coming home? I got a few more days in the boonies. Then I can wrap this up. - Did you get it? - Yeah, I got it. I nailed it. - You look so good. - I'm sort of glad I can't see you. The mind... it's a wonderful, dirty thing. But wait. Just one more thing I wanted to tell you. God, I'm having' fun. Okay, first of all... I'm gonna try not to cry. This is for Warren, who couldn't quite make the party... but is definitely on his way back home from what he calls hog heaven. Ned, who is one of two people who knows what I look like in the morning. Where is he? Ned? What are you doing? Usually, for these farewell bashes, I only budget domestic bubbly. To repeat, reports are sketchy. But we're receiving word that in the remote Darien section of Panama... a freelance news crew came under heavy fire within the past 24 hours. The group included at least one American. - We don't know if the survivors... - Enough of Bulgarian bullshit! Ive liberated the hard liquor! We can now confirm by this startling, unedited footage that the American... is former I.B. S newsman, Warren Justice. There he is. He's okay. Get down! Lt's now definitely confirmed that at least two crew members survived. - He's okay. He made it. - We're trying to technically... enhance these pictures so we can confirm exactly what we are seeing. We still don't know what motivated this attack. Information is contradictory... but it appears to indicate that an ambush took place... at this remote airstrip near the Colombian border in southern Panama. We are hearing via telephone hook-up with sources in Panama... that Justice was investigating reports about the arming of groups... violently opposed to the turning over of the Panama Canal. Excuse me. We have now confirmed that the American traveling with this group... former I.B.S. Newsman, Warren Justice, was killed today in Panama. Warren Justice was a seasoned journalist and a good friend. As we continue... to sort this out, we'll take a short break... to allow our stations to identify themselves. We'll have more on this breaking story in Panama when we return. This is the I.B.S. Evening News, I'm Tom Orr. Questions emerging from information uncovered by former I.B.S. Newsman... Warren Justice, before his death in Panama... are beginning to seem uncomfortably close to home to... some people in Washington. This network is just now editing tape obtained by Justice before his death. Information in this tape seems to change the face of... You know those faces. You remember those stories. They were the men and women who made I.B.S. News this year... number one in five of your twelve top markets. Next year, you can count on this: We're going to be even better... because the I.B.S. News Team just acquired a stealth weapon. You may not have caught her on W.M.I.A. You may have missed her at W.F.I.L. News. But none of us will soon forget her award-winning coverage... of the riots of Holmesburg Prison. What we in the news business must never forget is... we are only as good as the stories we tell. She arrived in our business from Small town, U.S.A. You can say that Sallyanne knew what she wanted, to be number one. And Sallyanne, as her family like to call Tally... wouldn't take no for an answer. Everyone said... "You want a job in television? You have to make a demo tape." So... I made a demo. Why hire Sally? Because I'm Sally, and I'm going to be a star. So, she walks into my office that first day in Miami. Skinny. God-awful clothes. Not much going' for her. Wanting to be anybody but herself. And I make her get my shirts and I make her get the coffee. I shoot down all of her stories. But she was tougher than me. She was already something. She was already the sun and the moon, all by herself. We at I.B.S. Hold a special place in our hearts... for that honored handful of news men and women... whose lives and careers, in the course of bringing home the news... have been cut tragically short. We salute them. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to begin a new generation at I.B.S. Tally Atwater. Panama turned out to be a big story for I.B.S. It didn't start that way. It started with one reporter... who had a hunch. He had a hunch. And he went alone. And he did all the leg-work. And, at the end of the day, he got it. Which is what going this is all about. I didn't always think that. I thought if I ever stood up at something like... that, it would be about glory or, showing people. It's different. I know that now. I'm only here for one reason. To tell the story. My husband told me that, not so long ago.
