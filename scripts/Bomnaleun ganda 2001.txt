You Ji-Tae Lee Young-Ae One Fine Spring Day Hi, excuse me. It's me. Hello. Hi! It's me, I am here... I called you. How are you? I'm from Ah Ram Sound Studio. My Name is Lee Sang-woo. I'm Han Eun-su. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Don't be late next time. Let me listen to it. Ma'am! -Are you finished? -Yes! That was fast. -Could I interview you? -Why not? What's your name? Kang Hwa-soon -Kang... Hwa... Soon? -Yes. -How old are you? How long have you been living in this bamboo forest? 52 years. -52 years? -Yes. I really like the sound of the wind when it blows through the forest. When does it sound the best? Of course it's when it snows, and the wind is blowing. The sound of the bamboo brushing against each other... ...can really comfort me. I see. I am starving! I will bring it over. Hurry up please. How long have you been doing sound recording? Around 5 years. You're not bad. Cut your fingers? Let me see. Oh, it's bleeding Try this. Come on. -It's okay. -Try this. Come on. Higher, higher. Above your heart. Where did you learn this? From my grandma. Do you live with your grandma? How nice. She's ill. Not like this, okay? Like this. Enjoy your lunch. Thank you very much. It's too much for you. You think I can't eat all of this? Make sure you finish it then. After breaking up with him... ...my heart is filled with sorrow and pain... Did I really love him? Never had I truly expressed how I felt inside... This is you, right? I have to DJ as well as produce in this small radio station. They only found out how much they love each other after they were separated. If they can meet each other again in the future. I guess they are just destined for each other. Don't. I want to listen to it. Be brave and give him a call. Ring...Ring... I think I can already hear his voice. It is so full of love. This is Han Eun-su's FM music hall... It's embarrassing! Would you get the light? Come on in. The third one sounds the best. I like the second one. The third one sounds softer, because... The third one's better anyway. Ms. Kang Hwa Soon has lived in the bamboo forest for 52 years. She said that the sound of the bamboo brushing against each other in the wind can calm her mind and heart. It can also help her forget all her worries. Today on ''Human and Nature''... ...let us hear the sound of the bamboo forest.... ...in Kangwon province. It must be hard working late every night. Doesn't your family worry? I wish I have someone to worry over me. Why don't you get married? I tried that once already. Do you know how to use a fire extinguisher? You have to pull the safety pin... point the hose to the fire... and squeeze the handle tight... I memorized it while I was making my coffee. The pain from the past. The sadness from the present. Is this a woman's destiny. Or is fate playing games with me. I know I have to choose the hardest road. I will never forget the past. Looking back in tears. Goodbye! A round of applause please! Mother. I'm good, aren't l? I'm getting better, right? Thank you, mother. Hey, you should pay for my song as well. Mom paid you already. I gave her that money. Why don't you go home? You want me to go away? I'm just kidding. Great grandma, great grandpa. Be careful with the album. Grandma looks pretty there. Mother...mother...mother. This is the train dad used to conduct. Grandma, who is this? My husband. Grandma, Who is this? Who is this old man? Mom, this is dad. This is dad when he was young. This is dad when he was old. What's grandma doing? She fell asleep. Aunt. What? Did grandma and grandpa get along well? Really well. Your grandfather took good care of her. He used to buy her all kinds of clothes and cosmetics. He also took a lot of pictures of her. Then why did he have an affair? Sometimes that happens. Oh, yeah? Sang-woo, you should get married while she's still alive. I'm serious. -Hello? -Speaking. Oh, it's you, Ms Han. Next Monday? Okay. Is it raining there? Not here. Okay, good night. I don't think we should do the recording today. We'll have to try tomorrow. What did you pray for back there? Don't remember. Thanks for the ride. You're welcome. Hey. Do you want some ramen? Come in. Ok. What kinds of alcohol do you like the best? Why do you ask? You've got a lot of bottles here. How long have you lived alone? Can you think of a better topic? Rice wine and ramen taste good together. I don't have any interesting story to tell. I'm kind of a bore. I can see that. You want to sleep over? Let's get to know each other first? This is embarrassing. Lower. Here? Lower. Here? Lower. It feels so good being with you. Hi, this is Sang-woo. I couldn't record yesterday because of the rain. I think I have to stay one more day... I'm at the temple. Hello, hello? The connection is bad. Now it's my turn. A fine spring day. The spring wind blows at my sheer skirt. I am leaving then. Ah-mei. Isn't this the spear of the tribe-master? That's all mother can give you. You must find Pipo. Let me talk to them. It's not Pipo. It's Papo, okay? Can we try one more time? Let's do it again. Something good happened to you recently? What do you mean? You know. Nah! I miss you too. Eun-su. Eun-su... You really do miss me? Okay. Good night. To Kang-neung. What? Kang-neung! Don't you know where that is? You're drunk. How much did you have? Jeong-kook,l fell in love with someone. She lives in Kang-neung. I'll pay you. I really have to go. You're not kidding? I want to see her now. She has to live that far? Thank you. Buy me a drink next time. Drive safely. Okay. -See you. -Bye. You look handsome when you're drunk. I feel good. Tell me about your high school days. I was a troublemaker. -What? -A troublemaker. Really? This is the house where I was born. It is? The radio station. This is where my great grandfather was born. You've lived here all your life? Yeah. See? My grandmother is passing by. Oh, passed. Another coming... Passed. Be careful, be careful. Oh, my god. You like it? Speed up now. No, this is fast enough. Come on. I can do this. Huh? Sang-Woo. After we die, how about getting buried together like that? Huh? You don't want to? Hello? Sister. Do you recognize me? Mother! Mother! Come on out. Mom, come on. It's not you who did anything wrong. Tell her that I am sorry. I am sorry. Who's she? Your grandfather's mistress. -You are not late yet? Are you? -Nope. -Is this right? -Yes. Thanks. Have you eaten? Go. I will see you later. Hey, who is he? Just a colleague. Does anyone at that station know we're seeing each other? You'd be fired if they know. Then we can't see each other no more. Want me to do yours? Don't! I'm sorry. You want some ramen? Yeah, I'm hungry. What kind do you want? Ttok ramen. Ttok ramen? Put some kimchi in it. Sorry I'm late. Today we have music critic Mr. Lee Chi-Fen here with us. This is Han Eun-su's FM music hall... You got your eyes done right? Please feel free to mail me your letters. -Having a good time? -Hi, brother. -How are you? -Good. I'm home. Grandma. I'm home. Where's mother? She's taking a nap in Sang-woo's room. It's too hot. She's not here! Where is she? She's sleeping there. She must have gone out. Stop it now. Come on. What are you doing? Didn't you hear that mother is gone? You guys wait for me. I've lost a lot, ok? Mother! That old woman is causing a lot of troubles for the family. When did she leave? Thank you so much. You guys should take better care of her. I understand. See you. This kimchi is really good. Who made it? My dad. No kidding. Can you make it? Yeah. You think I can't? My mom passed away when I was young. There was this one time when my dad started beating the crap out of me, I couldn't stop crying ''Mom! Mom! Mom!'' He never laid a hand on me since. And he wants to see my girlfriend. Sang-woo. I can't even make kimchi. I'll do it. No problem. Let me love you with all my life could bear, lalala... lalala... I heard you are doing another program? Hot, isn't it? Do you know how to use a fire extinguisher? Forget it. I know how to cheer you up. Want to have a drink? -Were you drinking? -No. You had a lot. Why did you drink so much? I didn't. You'd better lie down. Are you okay? What? Something's wrong. Are you really okay? What's wrong? Something's wrong. Don't cry. Don't cry... Eun-su, come and have some breakfast. Have some breakfast, Eun-su. I'm not hungry. I want to sleep more. I made something good. Get up, okay? I don't want to. Come on. Get up. Leave me alone! Just go away! How long have you been singing ''Arirang''? I started when I was 20... How long ago is that? 60 years. 60 years? Ma'am, do you sing ''Arirang'' with him too? That's a ridiculous question. Men do not sing with their wives. Not like these days. Not even once with her? Men do not sing with their wives. Not old man like me. Are you ready? Why don't you sing, Ma'am? I put up a thorn fence to hold in my youth. But it slipped away, leaving me with grey hair. The sun must set when it's time comes. I wish my lover had a good reason to leave. Arirang...Arirang...Arariyo. I follow my love up Arirang Hill. What are you going to do now? We're almost finished. What do you mean? I mean, we're almost finished. What's finished? I said we're almost done. Didn't you hear me? -What's finished? -Oh, Jesus. I just wanted to know... what you are going to do after this project? Okay? I've got to go somewhere. Come make me some ramen, okay? Okay? I have work to do. What work? Something I don't know about? You're going drinking aren't you? Eun-su. Do I look like your maid? Watch your language. Eun-su, I got you something to eat. This is FM Music Hall with Han Eun-su. Please feel free to share all your love stories with us. I loved you with all my life could bear. I trusted you with such sincerity. I know I shouldn't have loved you. I'd be willing to try it again, but goodbye... Hurry up. The producer is going crazy. Okay? All right. Is this the one? Hello? Where are you going? Move! I'm in the sound studio. It's been a while. I have to get back to work. Are you still angry? Are you happy that I came? Did you miss me? I should go. Are you asleep? No. Sang-Woo, let's not see each other for a month. Do you mean you want to break-up with me? Would you want to? I don't know. Grandma! Grandma! It's been a long time since we had dinner together. Do you normally have your meals at regular time? Sang-Woo. Where is your girlfriend? I thought I told you to bring her home. You have a girlfriend? Marry her, then. I can't take care of your family forever. I am tired. -I don't have one. -You don't? You should get married while your grandma is still alive. And I want a grandson too. You want me to set you up? I know a nice girl. Don't bother. I'm full. Can I be excused? Where are you going? You haven't finished yet. I lost my appetite. I bought pork belly just because you are home. Mother, eat slower, okay? Come on, mom. Something's going on, isn't it? Nothing's going on. Hang on son. Hi, it's me. How you doing? You sound busy. Okay. Don't want to bother you. Seems like we are pretty far away. You scared of me? Drive faster. Faster. Hello? I said I'd call you. Stop doing this. What are you doing here? Hey. What's up? I don't think I can continue working here. Let's go for a drink after work. I'll find someone to replace me. What are you talking about? What's the matter with you? You know better than that. Aw, fuck! What? Fuck? I'm sorry. Stay here... Come back! Let me stay here tonight. Let me stay here tonight. Sang-woo. Eun-su, want to see something funny? Don't act like this. You want a ride? No, thanks! I didn't do anything wrong, did l? See you. Could you stop, please? I want to break up. I'll do better. Let's break up. Do you love me? How could love disappear so fast? Let's break up then. Grandma, let's go. Grandma, come on. I have to wait for your grandfather. He's gone. He's passed away, Grandma. Let's go. Get a hold of yourself! Get a hold of yourself! -Hey, how've you been? -You skip dinner again? I'm eating now. Want to go to Kang-neung? Let's have a drink. Nah. I don't want to drink. Because if I get drunk, I will feel like she's waiting for me again. Sang-woo, forget about her. Imagine she's an old woman. Her hair's all gray, she's got wrinkles. That might help you forget. Just keep that in mind. Right. I feel kind of sorry for an old Eun-su. But I still miss her. Let's go. Stay a little longer. What are you doing here? I just wanted to see you. Are you going somewhere? Go home. I've got to leave. Do you want a ride? Was it hard to find? Yeah. You got here early? Yeah, we've been waiting for you. -My friends. -How are you? -You must be tired. Let's get inside. -OK! Sang-woo! Let it out. Buses and women are all the same. Once they leave, they will never stop for you. -How have you been? -Very well. You haven't changed a bit. Do you remember? What? You know... It's for your grandma. I heard plants are good for old people. Take good care of it. Stay with me today. What's wrong? I should go. Goodbye. Sang-woo!
