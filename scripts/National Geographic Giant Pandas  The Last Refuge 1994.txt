This knowledge could save the species After years of patient searching Pan and Lu Zhi now suspect a birth has occurred in a high den and set out on a September morning to investigate The treacherous slopes of Qin Ling are like fortress walls... and perhaps explain why the existence of giant pandas here was not confirmed until 1964 A gentle approach... to glimpse without disturbing In a cramped cave an adult female they have tracked closely... Cradled in her paws a tiny pink body Pan will find that a panda mother devotes herself entirely to her newborn She holds and soothes the baby continuously... neither leaving the den nor feeding for 25 days Blind and helpless the newborn is dwarfed by its mother... at about four ounces it weighs only 1/900th as much Perhaps in part to prevent an accidental crushing the infant panda wields a voice out of all proportion to its body Professor Pan's hope is that by studying the baby's needs he can learn enough to help avoid misadventures of the past involving pandas and human beings A panda was not seen alive in the West until 1936 when a cub named Su Lin was carried to the United States Though Su Lin would survive only 18 months it was love at first sight The public craved more pandas and zoos responded The sudden fad was called "panda-monium"... The panda was immediately beloved but poorly understood... treated as if the living animal were itself a child's toy... ...And the toy arrived without an instruction manual Keepers could only guess at its needs Nearly half died within five years As a result of our enchantment one in ten of the world's remaining pandas lives in captivity today... among the most popular and profitable of zoo animals The dream has been to breed pandas in captivity for release into the wild but arranged matings produce very few offspring The result has been a record of more deaths in captivity than births Even in a more natural enclosure in a Chinese panda reserve successful reproduction remains uncertain A female can conceive only during a few days each year In captivity males are mainly indifferent in part because they lack competition and often overweight Loud love songs frequently lead to no more than a wrestling match Even when young are produced their chances of survival are bleak In the past three decades nearly 60 percent have died within their first year Despite intense care this cub would live only five months So far, it has not been possible to breed a self-sustaining panda population in captivity For the species to survive protecting it in the wild is critical But time and habitat are running out A panda homeland that once stretched across southern Asia from Vietnam to present-day Beijing has shrunk under human pressure to only six small unconnected areas For about 240 wild pandas the slopes of the Qin Ling mountains are a last refuge By fitting pandas with radio collars and monitoring their signals professor Pan and Lu Zhi have been able to track the pandas in their study group from atar... ...and locate them easily for closer observation Theirs is an unprecedented bond between human and panda Never before have wild pandas wild pandas become so accustomed to scientists and allowed them so close "For nine years in Qin Ling Lu Zhi and I have lived among giant pandas We drink water from the same small stream with them and we have stayed together with them almost everyday They are familiar with our scent These pandas know us very well Lone pandas are often very tolerant But will a mother be so trusting if they attempt to visit the newborn inside the den? Hoping to conduct a thorough examination of the panda cub Professor Pan and Lu Zhi approach while the mother feeds some distance away from the new den. She has stayed away so long they now fear the cub may be dead erasing a scientific opportunity and another life in a lineage where each has become precious Their fears prove unfounded Pan knows his time to inspect the cub is limited Too long in the den and despite their efforts to gain her acceptance the mother could react violently to their presence here and attack them They usually observe from a distance but they must sometimes examine the infant panda closely to document its growth It's a female... an advantage for science In the years to come she may bear cubs of her own permitting study of a panda family across generations At seven weeks the baby weighs more than three pounds Her eyes are opening on the world Her expanding repertoire of sounds could alarm her mother still browsing nearby Pan is heartened by what he finds the cub appears normal and fit with a stomach full of mother's milk and a strong heartbeat Time is up The baby must be returned quickly to avoid a confrontation In the weeks to come Pan and Lu Zhi make an important observation When her cub is weeks old a wild mother leaves it to feed for hours at a time In the past this natural behavior was often though abandonment and many cubs were taken from their mothers only to die later in human care This all began with a boyhood dream of adventure in a far away exotic land... "When I was in high school I read Jack London's books Among the books, two greatly impressed me "White Fang" and "The Call of the Wild" Form then on I dreamed of living in remote areas like western America or Alaska or the Yukon River Valley... Living in the wild and among wild animals... that was my early dream and I hoped to make it my future The years have turned early fascination to enduring devotion Pan spends months of each year in primitive conditions paying some research expenses out of his own pocket working late hours to log and analyze data in a tiny cubicle that is both office and bedroom Pan's other world offers a stark contrast The rest of the year he spends in Beijing sprawling symbol of modern industrial China Here Pan is a biology professor at Beijing University His work was mainly in the laboratory until he and the panda had their first fateful encounter "Um, after graduating from college when I was 25years old, I had the opportunity to um, to go visit um, the Beijing Zoo where they had the first captive-born baby panda And that was the first time that I was able to hold a panda and it was very interesting The baby panda climbed all over me and that was when I decided I wanted to devote my whole life to studying the pandas" At a zoo in the ancient capital city of Xi'an a visit to a friend... Her name is Dan-Dan... a reference to her reddish-brown and-white coloration She is one of only three such pandas they know of Pan and Lu Zhi think this color scheme may be a throwback to prehistoric times Pandas may have developed their black and-white coloration as camouflage during the ice ages Finding Dan-Dan ill in the wild Pan and Lu Zhi brought her here for temporary care hoping she would be released later Her confinement disturbed Pan who was himself held prisoner in the late Sixties during the Cultural Revolution "The Cultural Revolution was a big mess No one dared to speak the truth Because I told the truth they put me in jail beat me and pulled my hair I thought: the only thing I can do is to insist on seeking the truth..." After 56 days of beatings and confinement in darkness, Pan escaped "Overcoming this suffering has become the basis for my conviction as a scientist always to tell the truth" In a Beijing classroom Pan carries his campaign on behalf of pandas to a wildly receptive audience Using props made from the skins of pandas who died in captivity Pan teaches about the need to protect wild pandas His stories evoke surprise The children thought pandas lived only in zoos Pan wants to inspire understanding of wild pandas in the generation that will probably decide their fate In a country to nearly with urgent human needs he faces a long road Even some friends cannot understand why he leaves his home and family several times a year for the sake of a wild animal the trip south to the Qin Ling mountains is itself a test of resolve then 14 hours by bus For Pan, this journey retraces the ancient retreat the panda before advancing waves of human settlements The last stands of wilderness like the last pandas survive only where food crops cannot... at the highest edges of existence For years, Professor Pan and Lu Zhi conducted a lonely enterprise But they have now attracted a following of students who staff the Qin Ling research station in seasonal shifts To Pan, they hold promise that the panda will not be forgotten And they have been staunch companions in an adventure that has sometimes been an ordeal "There were many difficulties when we started this research We always felt cold and clothes were always wet Lu Zhi got frostbite on her face and Ding Qian had frostbitten fingers Mid-December Four months have passed since the birthing season among Qin Ling pandas Cubs are now old enough to crawl from their dens and are sometimes found outside while their mothers browse nearby Face to face with humans, the cub seems by turns reticent and full of bravado To symbolize her importance for the future of pandas the two researchers have decided to name her Xi Wang-meaning "Hope" The christening is of no interest to a baby who may sleep 20 hours a day even when guests are present Easy slumber is a panda trait Nearby, her mother unwinds from the labors of eating bamboo Xi Wang seems vulnerable But animal predators pose less of a threat than humans A panda pelt can bring poachers more than $10,000 and dozens of panda cubs have been taken into captivity by well meaning "rescuers" who believed or wanted to believe that they had been abandoned. Xi Wang is still nursing so bamboo which will dominate her life is for now just a plaything A surprise... The mother returns and decides to move Xi Wang to a new den a routine occurrence But for Pan and Lu Zhi it's a rare moment Despite years of observation they have seldom seen two pandas even mother and young together in the open Touched by her devotion they call the mother Jiao-Jiao or "Double Charming" In Pan's study area only one farm has persevered in the harsh altitudes of panda territory En route back the two scientists visit the Li family who count themselves protectors of the pandas Pan has heard reports that a panda has been sighted in the vicinity It behaved as though ill Have the Lis seen it? They have, by the river and were surprised to encounter one so far down the mountain In a chill are rain at one in the morning Professor Pan and his team are summoned on a special mission... Villagers have sent word that a wild panda has appeared on a doorstep Pan thinks it may be the animal seen by the Lis The scientists are puzzled by a tendency of wild pandas to come to human dwellings when ill... an enigma in a creature normally so withdrawn Though they are neighbors of wild pandas few in the village have ever seen one Beneath corn [Zea mays] dried for hog [Suidae (family)] feed the creature huddles as if seeking help The animal appears old Pan asks if the panda has been fed It has not The man discovered it whimpering... ...and he was amazed Suspecting a digestive problem Pan decides to treat the panda back at camp It proves no easy task to relocate the 200-pound creature At Shashuping research station therapy begins with a breakfast of bamboo Weighing the old panda's good fortune at being rescued the students call him by a name that means "Lucky" Already, his appetite is returning... Antibiotics and vitamins mixed in honey meal quickly revive Lucky's spirit In ancient texts a creature believed to be the panda was known as "the iron-eating beast" ...because it chewed up metal cooking utensils ...and it still tries to Lucky, it turns out, has an unruly curiosity and an indiscriminate palate Eventually the cautious researchers manage to retrieve this unusual delicacy In Shashuping's field lab Lu Zhi adds samples of Lucky's blood to a growing collection from pandas living in isolated groups Through genetic analysis she seeks to learn how much inbreeding has occurred In a hundred years, she fears all Qin Ling pandas could be first cousins This could cause extinction through harmful mutations and vulnerability to disease "There is a critical question: if this animal is inbreeding then how much and how bad the inbreeding could be This work, we hope will answer this question and then we'll find a way to help pandas" Recovered after a week of treatment Lucky is ready to be released... Pan is hopeful but the scientists know Lucky may be too old to survive in the wild Weeks later their fears will be confirmed Again ill Lucky will be taken to a feeding center where he will die In the bitter cold of early January while other Qin Ling animals hibernate the panda cannot Enslaved by the need to eat almost perpetually pandas continue to roam the frozen forest Pan and Lu Zhi have learned to respect the panda's tough constitution Thick, oily fur and bulky bodies insulate them and they seem immune to the cold For Xi Wang, snow is just a new terrain to explore Now a five-month-old toddler she seems dimly aware that trees are important In the months to come they will offer her only safety from predators in her mother's absence But to hide in a tree Xi Wang must first learn to climb it For now, baffled by the challenge she gives up For those who would study pandas winter in the Qin Ling mountains is a test of resolve... The cold is relentless... even inside Days and nights pass in the shared chores of a dwelling heated only by wood fire lit only by candle and lantern As winter drags on Jiao-Jiao begins to take Xi Wang with her while foraging The ancient Chinese may have found in such scenes of tranquility a symbol of peace According to one account retiring armies waved not a white flag but an image of a panda For Xi Wang another attempt to climb Success brings not only safety but a measure of youthful adventure As winter gives way to spring the panda's realm in the Qin Ling mountains reawakens with sound and color By may the new foliage intrigues Xi Wang At nine months she continues to nurse but like human babies she investigates the world with her mouth For Jiao-Jiao spring brings not only the bamboo shoots she treasures but the seasonal agony of ticks [Metastigmata (suborder)] and leeches [Hirudinea (class)] Xi Wang will watch her mother from the trees another four months until she's ready to join her foraging along the forest floor Once tentative, she now climbs about freely sometimes showing greater daring than judgment Jiao-Jiao seems concerned about a well-padded youngster especially when succulent bamboo shoots are abundant For both, life is serene They look awkward but pandas are deceptively agile their joints so flexible they can bite their own tails and perform gymnastic routines in suspenseful slow motion Clear-cut harvesting of the panda's forests is the paramount threat to their continued existence Food and cover dwindle Populations are further isolated Panda ranges have declined by half in only two decades... primarily from logging A billion people in China need wood for homes and heat In fifty years it could be almost two billion Over the years Professor Pan has watched timber companies invade 70 percent of Qin Ling's panda habitat He asks how far the loggers intend to go Next spring, they will cut all the way over the mountains the slopes now roamed by Jiao-Jiao and Xi Wang To penetrate the panda's forest new roads must be blasted out of the mountainside By most standards the operations are crude sometimes conducted with a casual daring that mixes gun powder with cigarettes Industrial safety is a recent development here but despite accidents the work goes on relentlessly Risking all Pan has pleaded with authorities to stop the logging of Qin Ling With stubborn insistence despite threats and harassment he has succeeded The government has halted the timber cutting in the An excursion to check on Xi Wang now outfitted with a radio collar... It is mid-October At fourteen months Xi Wang is passing her second autumn Something is amiss The signals lead to a tangled clump of brush Expecting Xi Wang they find only her collar Pan believes Jiao-Jiao tore the collar from her youngster He suggests they search for Jiao-Jiao instead But Jiao-Jiao's signal is weak... ...They will have to separate and scour the slopes Xi Wang is invaluable to science She has been monitored since birth and has provided unprecedented information But for Pan and his crew this panda has also become a friend Following his instincts Pan comes to a steep ravine... Barely visible among the foliage sitting casually in a tree the familiar shape of Xi Wang To re-establish contact they must sedate and re-collar Xi Wang They must act now before they lose her again But her perch above a cliff makes it a delicate operation The tranquilizing dart is necessary the pain to be inflicted slight But the moment is always disconcerting to those whose lives are dedicated to protecting wild things Several minutes pass as drowsiness sweeps across her They pray she won't fall Now docile Xi Wang stays in the tree enabling them to bring her down safely At 80 pounds she is a precious but awkward burden The professor who is her observer and defender a father of two daughters bears her as carefully as if she were a third Using radio collars Pan and Lu Zhi have been able to keep track of the whereabouts and activity of more than Theirs is the first comprehensive study to document social and breeding behavior of wild pandas These periodic inspections are inconvenient for Xi Wang and rob her of dignity But she is contributing details of her development that can be obtained in no other way Xi Wang's story could affect her entire species revealing how to ensure their survival in the wild and to improve their care in captivity For Xi Wang it has been a day of curious events and a close encounter with another species... She returns to her mother and the life of endless simplicity now interested only in a drink of water and soon perhaps, a little bamboo At the Shashuping research station, a moment of farewell After months of work four of Pan's students must return to the university Assistants will come and go during the years ahead but Pan intends to stay here as long as it takes to understand the life of pandas in the wild and to keep them roaming freely through the surrounding forests In the ritual exercise called qigong Pan daily rekindles his determination "My friends in Beijing always ask: 'Why do you continue to work... "...in the field year after year? When will it end? Your work has been published Why don't you stop? I tell them: "My goal is to protect the panda and to establish a refuge for them in the wild That is my mission but it will be difficult Achieving this goal may take my entire lifetime And even that may not be enough" So one man perseveres as solitary as his pandas a lonely figure in this island of wilderness One man and one panda Since these scenes were filmed Xi Wang has struck out on her own In the not too distant future she could have a cub herself As pandas have for millions of years she will feast on the forest drink from cold streams endure the chilly mists But her passage though life will be recorded for the ages because, like her name Xi Wang represents for all her species... a last fateful glimmer of hope
