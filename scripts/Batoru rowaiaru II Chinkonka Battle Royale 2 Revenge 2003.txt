The world entered an Age of Terrorism. Nanahara Shuya, leader of the anti-BR group, Wild Seven, became an international terrorist suspect. In the name of "justice," the adults introduced a new game. The Millennium Anti-Terrorism Act AKA: BRII The die is cast. We refuse to forgive any of those adults who made us murder each other. Let us rise up... and fight together. We now... declare war against every last adult. BATTLE ROYALE II Requiem Three years ago, my father, a teacher, was shot and killed by his students. The central figure in my father's last painting was a young girl. After I realized it wasn't me, I never could face school again. Now I've decided to join the Game, to confront my feelings about my father. Wanted: for Murder and Accessory Nanahara Shuya, Nakagawa Noriko BRII: Bright, cheerful, fun. Thank you for registering. And so I enrolled at Shikanotoride Middle School, a ragtag collection of losers and delinquents from across the country. We'd all been written off by adults. Buncha jocks. None of us had any future. For me, the only thing that felt real was my plan. Shit! Friends - Shintaro You, too, Taku. Not me. Why not? Sign it, you graduated. Nothing's finished yet. Hey, hey! Shintaro! - Hey! My neck! - Where are we? What the hell? To you, the 10 million fans of Battle Royale! Look! the bus has just arrived under extremely tight security. This time, Class B in 9th grade at Shikanotoride Middle School has been chosen. Look! You can see the students! Go in closer! Go in closer! Get a good look, folks. This is a specially selected bunch of losers! They're the first students to play under the new, revised BR rules! As the whole world watches, what battles can we expect this time? Thanks to our sponsors, they're getting their combat uniforms and watches. Imagine the stirring sight of 42 youthful, passionate deaths! Be seated! Teacher! Teacher! What the hell? All yours, sir. Merry Christmas! I'm Takeuchi Riki, in charge of your class. By the way, you guys do understand what's happening... We're clueless. You've gotta explain. This necklace hurts, teacher. Japan, China, North Korea... What's that shit? - Load of crap. - Let's split. Time to go. Move! Cuba, Congo, Peru, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Grenada, Libya, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Sudan, Yugoslavia, and... Afghanistan. What do they all have in common? In the past 60 years, America has bombed every one of them. Some eight million dead among 22 nations. Equality? That's a lie. There's no such thing as equality! It's been one year now, since that disastrous act of terrorism last Christmas. The terrorists who destroyed so many lives in an instant have barricaded themselves on an island. As he claimed responsibility for the terrorist act, their leader, Nanahara Shuya said, "We declare war against all adults!" Go right ahead. By the way, in this country, you're not an adult until you're 20. Anyone else is a child! Have you ever considered just how much money it takes to raise a child to adulthood? Huh? What the... the hell? Save your weapons for later. Somewhere between That's what your lives are worth right now. This impoverished country can no longer afford to support expensive, worthless kids like you! So the adults discussed it with the bigwigs, and decided to reject his declaration of war. If you want a war that badly, you kids fight it out! Sorry to have kept you waiting. BR II! Today, you guys go to war. Not so fast! BR ll is a whole new war game, based on the BR Act, with simple rules. Track down and kill the evil leader, Nanahara Shuya, and you win. You've got 72 hours. Got that? No way! See that white line on the floor? There are only two sides in life, the winners and the losers. Anyone who crosses that line has the guts to be a winner. Players to the right and losers to the left. The losers are bad. This is the line that divides good from evil. It's white or black. There's nothing in between! I'll call your names in order. Boy #1, Aoi Takuma. Girl #1, Asakura Nao. Are you two for the winning or the losing team? We don't need losers, so they die. Here goes. Three... two... -one. - Asshole! What the hell? Girl #4, Kitano Shiori. You're on board? Yes. A Christmas gift for this brave girl! Shiori! Wait, Shiori! Now, back to our first pair. One last time. You on the winning or the losing team? Here goes. Three, two, one... We hardly have a choice! - Taku! - Are you crazy? Shutup! But I'll never trust adults! It'll never work out like you say! Oh, yeah? - Taku... - Nao! Nao! Okay, next! Boy #2, Urabe Shugo.

Boy #15, Makimura Shintaro. Girl #15, Fukuda Kazumi. I absolutely refuse. Come again? I refuse to participate! Shintaro... Loser! Sorry, I'm going ahead. Go right ahead. What the hell are you guys doing? Don't you see this is crazy? Why the hell should we have to fight? You sure, Shintaro? Here goes! Three, two, one Okay, then. Don't, Taku! Are you nuts? Hurry, come on over! Hurry UP! I absolutely refuse! Think it over carefully, Shintaro. You've spent your whole life losing. This is your last chance. I haven't lost yet! Here goes! Three... two... one! Shintaro! Why? Why, Shintaro? Friends - Shintaro Are you crazy? We're friends, right? Cut the crap, man. Cut the crap. Cut the crap, Shintaro! Boy #15 Shintaro Dead - 41 To Go Me? Kazumi! Oops, sorry, I forgot. You play this game in pairs. Kazumi, you're #15, just like Shintaro, right? Each of your necklaces is linked to your seating partner. One of you goes, the other automatically... Boom! Blows up. What's wrong with you guys? For real? For real. - Are you really dead? - Cut it out! Okay, listen up, guys. You pairs stay within 50 meters of each other of you'll blow! So be careful, now. Were friends. Sorry about before! Kazumi! The necklace, it won't shut up! Mommy! Girl #15 Kazumi Dead - 40 To Go Next! Boy #16... No! Shintaro, no! That's the spirit. You 40 survivors, all in the game! Go! Run! Move it! The Game Begins Day One Mission 1: The Landing Maneuver Attention, everyone. Attention, everyone! The time is 06:00. Launching the maneuver. Check the map on your navigators. Our enemy is barricaded in a hideout on the hill. There are three attack points. The island's divided into several zones. Every hour there'll be a new danger zone. You should leave the new zone before it gets hot or you'll blow automatically. We're releasing the boats from auto control. Prepare to land immediately! Cut it out! It's me! Help! No! Please, help!

Something's coming out. What is it? What did I ever do? Oh, no! Miki! That idiot. You're in the danger zone! Unless you get back here, Shugo's necklace will blow, too! I peed my pants. I peed.

I'm sort of disappointed in you. These deaths lack individuality. Put some guts into it and battle for your lives! Get some rest, Taku. Hey. Hey! Shutup! Aren't you pissed? They murdered all of them! Of course I'm furious. I can't believe I'm here, fighting like this. I'm pathetic. What's up, Kuze? What is that? Insulin. A joke, right? It's my parents' DNA. I can't live without it. But I've only got three days' worth. I never dreamed we'd wind up here. Your first smoke? We have... so many things we've never learned, and never tried. What are we doing here fighting a war'? Hey. Hey! Hosaka? Over here. Here. - Look! What's that? - What happened? Nobody move! It's a trip mine. Don't! It's Jo and the rest of Squad 2. Jo! Nanami! You okay? Risa, what'll I do? I'm scared! Don't worry, I won't leave you. Stay away from me! Are you crazy? I'm sick of this! Totally sick of this shit! Don't move! Don't move! Shit! Hold on, Jo! We're coming! Kitano! I won't let you. And let friends die? We get Nanahara first. I won't let you die until we get him. Risa! Honami! Honami! Hurry! Hurry! Kurosawa, do you copy? This is Jo. Answer me! Jo! You okay? Anyone hurt? They got six of us. Maezono, too. Really? Jo, we're approaching Position A. Let's finish this thing off before dark. You're on. You happy now? Fuck! Mission 3: The Assault Haruya! Hurry! Nanami! Taku! You okay? Sagisawa! Takuma! What are you doing? A necklace! - Wait! - A child! What's going on? Wait! Drop your weapons! Disarm! Disarm! Don't move! Disarm or I'll blow you away! Hurry! These kids are wounded. Please, help us! What do we do, Kurosawa? What are you doing, Maho? Let's surrender, Maho. Over my dead body! You're crazy! Don't run! Nanahara Shuya! Where the hell are you? You die and it's all over! I'll blow you away! Get out here! Stop, Maho. Stop! Kurosawa, let's surrender. How can you guys forget the horrible pain they caused? I'll never forget it. What are you doing, Kurosawa? Shutup! I lost my whole family to your terrorism! How the hell would you guys know what it's like to lose your family? Their bodies were blown to bits! My dad, mom, sister... all blown into bits and pieces! Fuck your terrorism! Fuck your war! I'll never forgive you for what you did! Cut it out! We're all the same! We're just like you! Just put down your weapons! Shut the fuck up! Toki! S'0p! Kurosawa! Kitano! Nanahara Shuya! Maki, activate the EMB. But Shuya, that's for our escape. Just do it. Got it. We're activating the EMB! Girl #10 Yuko Maisukawa Dead I'm sorry. Here we 90, GUYS! Ready or not! What the hell? All wiped out? Impossible to confirm. No necklace signals at all! Hackers? Audio monitor's dead. - No sign of explosions. - What the hell? A powerful electromagnetic field in Zone G-6. Electromagnetic field? We're confirming it now. What's an electromagnetic field? Day Two Nanahara Shuya? What are you going to do with us? Wanna finish off the game? Fine with me! That's enough! You, come here. Sit! Don't move. It'll blow. Answer me. What do you want with us? What did you come here for, dressed up for combat? You call that fighting? Get to your fucking point. Ever seen this weapon? The AK-47. Automatic Kalashnikov. The international symbol of guerilla resistance. When we survived the game three years ago, the other survivor and I escaped our country for a place that's been at war for 20 years. Overflowing with four million refugees, runway inflation, whole areas reduced to rubble by bombs. The conditions its people endure defy imagination. But even under those hellish conditions, their smiles were always those of a proud people. The open smiles of the children. So what? What the hell's that got to do with us? What are you fighting for now? Listen. Kill me and the game's over. But would your struggle end? Can you forget all this, and resume your old lives? Then what are you fighting for? They all died because of you! We'll keep on fighting, even if we have to fight every last adult in the world. Until the day that we can smile the open smiles of the children we once saw. Shuya, Special Forces, approaching our rear. Here we go. Back to our hideout. All of us here either survived a game or lost family. We're not your enemies. We're going. You, too! - Wait, Jin! - Hey! Taku! You kids stay back. Hide! I didn't have a clue what the hell your point was. How does it feel? To murder others? To survive all alone? How does it feel? You aim a gun, you shoot it. This is what it takes to survive. Yuuma? Yuuma? Yuuma! Down! HQ! This is Mamiya! The students have gone over to the terrorists! We're being slaughtered! Send reinforcements! Sir! Sir? Shit! You're just a bunch of brats! You got me. Shit. I have a family, too. The rain kept falling. Day Three Nozomi. Hang on, Nozomi. Only the moans of the dying echoed heavily in our minds. Nozomi! Sagisawa! Sagisawa! I'm sorry, Sagisawa. I... I... Survive. All of you, survive. Don't forget about me. Don't forget. Nozomi! Sagisawa! Girl #6 Sagisawa Nozomi Dead We lost another friend. Now, what are we supposed to do? Answer me! There is no answer. You've got to find it for yourself. Taku! We never had anywhere we could go. I knew that all along. Or any place to go home to! This is war, right? You're all fighting for your lives! But die and you're just one more candle! Even those poor little kids. You're all the same. You're no better than the adults! How I wish this war would end. I keep on asking myself... what can I say to all those who have died? I don't know. But inevitably, we all grow up to be adults. The best we survivors can do is to keep remembering the ones who died. Always and forever, even after we grow up. Hello? Hello? Hello? What are you doing? I told you to knock. You stink. Don't come in here. Listen, today's your birthday, right? Thought you and Mom and I could go out. You're the worst. What? My birthday was yesterday. It's today, isn't it? It was yesterday. Just get out. Listen, Shiori. Still got more to say? What? I guess I should... do this, right? What an idiot. The thing people fear most, isn't death, it's being forgotten. We're all here, now. We all wanted someone to know. You'll be fine, just fine. It's not because you're sick that you keep losing your temper. If you make friends at this school. you'll get better. Because all the kids here are just like you. I promise I'll come and get you. Please, let's go. One day, they'll all disappear. Family, friends. But I'll always be by your side. I can't do anything for you, but I'll be there. I promise. Nobu. Kawada. All you guys. I'm not wrong, am I? I'm fighting along... with the best of you, right? You Okay? - Mimura! - Run! Shit! Blowing a couple of guys away won't change a thing in this country. But I don't know any other way. Survive this! And don't look back! And then, finally, the rain let up. How much blood has been shed? How many tears spilled? All our friends who fought beside us are dead, killed in the last three years. But even as justice can never be vanquished from the world, we terrorists will never vanish, no matter how evil they make us. Because we know... that a handful of adults, a handful of nations, selfishly define the nature of peace and freedom in this world. But our world is so much more complex than that. This world has six billion people living their own lives, in six billion different ways. There are six billion kinds of peace, six billion kinds of justice, six billion kinds of war and evil. No one has achieved peace without fighting for it. Behind every peace, there's a river of blood, sweat and tears. It's going live to global host computers. But if we avert our eyes from that history and abandon it, then peace might as well be dog shit. Dog shit, huh? Japan, China, North Korea, Guatemala, Indonesia, Cuba, Congo, Peru, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Grenada, Libya, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Sudan, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan. To all you children of the world who battle in solitude, you may be lonely, but it's time to stop being afraid. To all the abandoned children of the earth, let's rise up together and fight together. We're throwing away the old rules, taking off to a world far, far away! Tonight, I send this message to all the adults who stole our freedom and pinned us down. Merry Christmas. Nanahara Shuya, Wild Seven. Evacuate! Are you okay? Look after the baby, the children... Who fired the missiles? We're still investigating. Sir, a call for you! Who the hell's calling at a time like this? It's the Prime Minister. - Put him through. - Yes, sir. Hey, teacher, what a mess, huh? Who do you think fired those missiles? We finally pissed that country off. I just got a call from their President. They're going to attack in 12 hours. What the hell's going on with your class? What are you waiting for? So what if a dozen kids die? It doesn't matter. Fire a missile and blow up the whole damned island! You really mean that? You surprise me. I thought you were a full-fledged adult who'd crossed the line a long time ago. You do understand? There are only two sides, the winners or the losers. Which side are you on? Fight with that country for justice and freedom... Cut the crap, you murderer! What? Half a century ago, that country compared ours to a 12-year-old. How old does that make that country now? If any country pisses it off, it just bombs them. You call that adult behavior? Listen, the whole world's rallied behind that country. And who made that choice? So what the hell are you doing there? I see. Too bad. I had hopes for you. Exercising my full power as Prime Minister, I call upon the armed forces. Prepare for battle immediately, before that country launches its missiles. I want every last terrorist and Nanahara Shuya dead. Attention! Salute! Taku! Taku! Taku? Taku? Takuma? Kuze? You Okay? I can't really move. But we've got to get back or Nao will worry. You're hurt. Save your strength. How ironic, isn't it'? What? I always wanted to be alone with you. But now that my dream's coming true, look at me. I..- I never used to care about dying... but... but... but now... Kuze? Kuze! Girl #5 Kuze Haruka Dead Drink? No thanks. It's nearly dawn. Our battle with the adults is about to begin. In the six months we've been here, we've stumbled upon a mine shaft. It might lead back to the mainland. Take the children and escape. What about you? We'll stay here and draw the enemy in. This is no place for you. The real struggle lies ahead. Truly living life is 100 times harder than dying. The Final Morning This is Sakai at Position B. We're deployed. Yonai from Position C. We're ready. Shuya? I'm going to stay and fight. Jin, give me your gun. This is the Kalashnikov Mimura gave me. You know how precious it is to me. I'm leaving it with you. Protect the others. Shuya... I know you'll lose your way. But whatever you do, never give up. Farewell. Sister. I..- I'll never forget you. What's wrong? You go, too. I'm staying here. To see this through to the end. Draw them in closer. Not yet. Closer. Not yet. Not yet. Fire! Kazama! Kazama! Dig in! Hold 'em off! Taku, what's wrong? I..- I don't understand things much and I don't want to. But if I run away now, I'm turning my back on something important. You want to go back, don't you? I can't go back. I promised Shuya. I..- What am I supposed to do? Decide for yourself. I'm going. Kyoko! I was always in love with you! Go, then. Yes! I'm sorry I always make you worry. I'll see you again, right? Of course. I'm going to find an answer. Yo! What are you idiots doing here? We're in this together. Hey! Hey! Shibaki! Shibaki! No big deal. I'm glad I made friends. Go, now. Shibaki! - Now or never! - Okay, here goes! Go! Taku. Give my love to Kyoko. Osamu! We're going. Ouch! Boy #3 Kasai Osamu, Boy #6 Shibaki Dead - 7 To Go Sakai! It's me! What the hell are you doing here? Why'd you come back? It's not over yet, is it? Aren't you fighting to the end? To honor the ones who've died! Sakai! Hold on, Sakai! Sakai! Shuya! We've only just begun to fight, right? Don't stop. Keep on fighting. Sakai! Shuya! Go ahead! Maki! You guys, too. See this thing through! Hurry! We're going! Maki! Haruya. Hurry! Yo! So you're Nanahara Shuya? I'm Takeuchi Riki. "We declare war against all adults!" Gotta hand it to you, you've got guts. Every adult on earth wants you dead. From now on, you'll have to live with all the lives you've taken. Including my daughter, who died in your terrorist attack. Neither of us have anywhere to call home. Boy #1, Aoi Takuma, Girl #4, Kitano Shiori. Question. In life there's only the winning or the losing side. Is that really true? Go. You'll only find the answer by living your lives. I..- always did want to play rugby with you guys. Just go. Three... two... one Go! Hey, look. There's a light. Let's go)! Hang on. Hang on! Can I ask you something? That girl in the painting, Nakagawa Noriko. What's she like? Who are you? Kitano Shiori. You killed my father, Kitano. Noriko always... looks you straight in the eye and smiles openly. Listen. If you hate someone, you have to be prepared for the consequences. I'm sorry. I never... once called you... my own father, "Dad." Girl #4 Kitano Shiori Dead - 6 To Go I'm out of ammo! Kitano! Hey, Kitano! The last of our weapons. Game Over Boy #1 Takuma, #5 Haruya, Girl #1 Nao, #3 Kyoko, #8 Risa, #13 Mayu and Nanahara Shuya Whereabouts Unknown Really? It's Taku! Taku! Nao! Hey, Taku! You're alive! Shuya. Jin. Noriko? Welcome home. Once again my best wasn't good enough. Did you know? Even in this place that's been at war for decades, spring is so beautiful. The seasons will always return. I promise. See you, then. Yeah. We're all in this together. Whenever, wherever we are. The path we've chosen is so perilous and so long. But now we know all over the world, we're in this together. And we can go as far as we want. We do have a future... as long as we can dream of it.
