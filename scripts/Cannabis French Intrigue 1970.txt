As soon as they are fledged, the trouble begins. Either they build bombs, or they cry for revolution. Of all things the son of the mafia boss, and most of his friends are niggers. I had a visitor recently, a guy called Carbona. Carbona knows the business in France. All the drugs pass France. Those are excellent Labs you should get along with them. That could be interesting. Carbona will help you. He is going to be on the same flight with you tomorrow evening. I don't want to leave that fast. I really like you Serge, but don't forget it was me, who got you into the Mafia. You had been the sleazy russian guy for everyone, the annyoing foreigner. Nobody wanted to help you. But you forget we are all only foreigners here. So you will take the flight tomorrow. I did a lot for you already. I could do a lot more for you. You mustn't disappoint me. I trust on you, you damn russian pig. Is Paul coming along? - You don't need him for this job. The plane to paris is ready. I repeat: Last call for flight 1 14 to Paris. It's going to be tough. You will do it. - You never had made it alone. I'm sick of it. I got enough of all this. I only have one wish. When all this is done, i want to leave, as far as possible. From that dough i'll buy a farm. And there you'll spend your remaining years, togehter with your wife. So you think it's not that easy? - Why shouldnt it? Above all things i want to go to the south. Sit in the sun, under palm trees. You want Coffee, Tea or Milk? Good, i'll get it for you. Would you like to drink something? Good evening, are you busy? - Not at all. Do you know France? - Yes. When it gets boring someplace, i step on the next plane and off am i. To New York, to London, and now I want Paris. I'll just take the next plane and I'm done. How about you? I don't want to do anything. I just travel for fun. That's not bad. - Anyway, I'm sick of it all. Sitting around, the travelling... - I'm never bored. Maybe that's because I'm not very demanding. And what do you expect? I like to see new things. - Are you happy? Well, I think I am. Why not? That's going to be expensive for you. - M. Carbona, It's not my fault. Those are Emery's killers, the two deaf-mutes. No worries, I'll handle them. - Where are you going anyway? Good evening, old friend. I knew I'd meet you here. Well. You still look great. How are your deaf-mutes? And how are you? - Oh, always the same. You get older. That gets to me. - I know that. There are days when I wake up and can hardly move anymore. But you pull yourself together anyway. - You won't be destroyed by cancer. Have you been to a doctor? - What would I want with a doctor? I know that I'm sick - Don't listen to him. His constant talking makes me feel sick all over, too. But today it isn't as bad as it used to be. You suffer, you die... That's the way it is. What do you want? You have all that, you have Rita. You have achieved everything you wanted. You never were ambitious anyway. So, everybody likes you. Everybody respects you. You are to be envied! Sure, disregarding the fact that I don't like your deaf-mutes, they earn way too much. - That's none of your business. Do you hear that, Rita? He thinks it's none of my business. And what do you have to say about that? - I don't think that it can continue like that. The last word hasn't been spoken yet. - Too late, that will no longer happen. You exposed yourself too much. What have you become? You are mighty and powerful. And what do you do? You fill in checks, receive the foreign legions cross of merit, and now even the cops salute you. It's long ago that you touched a weapon. Go die of cancer and leave me alone. Aren't you afraid of the Americans? Don't worry, i can deal with them. First i will take care of the Carbona Family. Hello? Is the doctor there? Jane Swenson. Yes, ok, thank you. I'll wait. No, stop this. Hang up. Do what i tell you. The is a little book in my Jacket. There it says where you have to call. You will discover it later. What i want to show you in the book is the fact, that the attitude of the youth towards intoxication is the same, but not towards oriental culture. I am definitely also thinking about the young people that are going to India, to Nepal. But they are not looking for the cultural ideas. The are looking for the drug, nothing else. This has to be prohibited, especially from your side. Thats your job. That has nothing to do with my job. I am not speaking as a police officer, but as a philosopher. How interesting. I think you don't have fun drinking. I am not into entertaining myself. My wife likes these parties. She somehow likes these snobs. It's cold here. Cold and humid. My rheumatism immediately acts up. I used to operate in the big hospitals. The hygienic facilities are not really up to date here. But you can cope with that. So what, first you catch a black eye. And then you call for me, and i have to be there. You know what Flats, Hotels and Rooms i have seen? I operated in cellars and barns. Once in the middle of a forest. There she is. It's bleeding hefty. Some kicked the bucket. He has slimmed. The woman like that apparently. Anyways, if i would see a girl like you with somebody like him... Most important that you have fun. When i see something fragile like you. Yes. Your eyes, your complexion. No, you can't fool me. You are young. You still have a smooth and firm skin. But that will decay quickly. Remember that. So, you observed how Emery was refueling? Yes, M. Bardeche, i lost him in a traffic jam in Aix. But i disovered him. He entered the "Hotel du Roi Rainier". Since they brought in his luggage, i assumed that he stayed there over night. Then he surely entered the bar and met somebody there, right? Yes. They had a long conversation actually. Then he continued his trip to Marseille. - Thats right. And there he directly went to the harbour, dispatching the overseavessels, so i presumed he wanted to get a freight deal done there. But he didn't stay there. - He went straight to the city hall. Yes, indeed. I was quite surprised. - So? I am not surprised at all. Slowly i am getting to know him. I am sure that, he is having me observed. He is having me followed. So put your man on the leash. For my sake relocate him to Nouma or whereever. If that is all, you dont have to fear a lot. It will be OK. - Listen, Edouard, this M. Bardeche should disappear. - I understand, i understand completely. I promise you that i will take care of that. Too bad that this man is not open for reason. He doesn't respond to financial propositions at all. You said it yourself, this guy is not from this world. Where should I drop you off? At the ministery? - Please. To the ministry. Is it already healing a bit? A bit. It looks better already, but you shouldn't move the arm. Above all, you should sleep now. When i feel better, i will sleep more. For the injections. I got that a long time. I had a head injury, the sleep center got damaged by that, nobody can fix that. Well, I dream and I dream. The nights are so long as if i was living twice. I miss the natural dreams, that everyone usually have while sleeping. Who are you? What are you doing? It's you! Now you are knocked over, aren't you? I'm quite fast, aren't I? The doctor called in New York. You should be happy to see me again. Hey, man. Is there anything drinkable here? - Everything you want. I really came in a rush. When they told me, that they will send me... Boy, you dont picture this. - I told you before. A job in Paris is not an everyday opportunity. Two americans that can do what they want. Let's put it this way, that can almost do what they want. You don't have to get mad about these guys. That's peanuts. We will get them quickly. Do you want to see my new invention? I fooled the customs with this. Not bad, eh? You see? It's great, isn't it. Open, Close. Great toy. Look, do you understand what this means? We'll find your deaf-mutes. Now you got me and i got you. Ain't that funny? Say, isn't that a joke? Paul and Serge in Paris. Nothing can go wrong now. Thats for sure: Nobody can hold the candle to us. We are never going to have the short end of the stick. We are inseperable, undiscoverable and unbeatable. I'm glad, Paul. I knew you'd come. Why do people put such crap on their walls. Do you get that? That's really a drag. I'd prefer mirrors. What can i see there? Myself! At least i am alive. There is action, it's moving. Strange guy, your friend Paul. He must be really attached to you. I guess so. Thats entirely mutual. He helps me. The attitude he has towards life. He sings, he dances. I feel as if he is watching me. He is interested in everything, has fun with all kinds of this. And besides that he is a good shooter. He passionately loves weapons. Soon you are fit again. And you'll be able to go. Both of you will go then. - Yes. We are not her for fun. - No. I think we've got better things to do than asking each other questions . Everything has an end sometimes. I am like you on that question. I have always done everything very thoroughly. You don't need to move out from here. Just stay. Both of you can stay here, if you want. Yeah, i am alive. I am laughing. And living. The bill, please. Look Madame, i am looking for a Mme. Carbona. - Who? She is the wife of a guy, whose name is Carbona. You know him? I am looking for two guys, that can't speak, deaf-mutes. Ah, no. Why don't you go to the Police. - The Police? Thanks. Look, over there at the Bar There is a young american, he was asking for you. - An american? Yes. Do you want to talk to him? - No, by no means. Somebody should follow him. - Alright. Looks as if we have the same drink. The color is the same. But his is pure alcohol. Take a guess how nutritous that is. It just contains Vitamins and Lecithin. It's incredibly healthy, raw eggs and tomatos. Thats my line. Thats the best for me. It gives me strength. You know, When i think of those guys, that cannot stop boozing... Remember Andr? Do you recall shortly before his death how he was sitting in the Casino? We watched him gambling. He knew that he had to bite the dust / believe in it(?) The more he won, the more he drank. I always brought him the champagne. At his table the 22 came three times in a row . Three times, really. He has never been so cheerful. I can tell you that. Though he even knew it. - And that made quite an impression to you? Why? It's actually not true that he drank so much. He had tuberculosis since 20 years. You wouldn't have been able to save him too. And now he's dead. So what? I always tell myself that I'm already dead. That's why I am so quiet. - Do you know why he has been released? He should have been able to die in his bed, and because to stop him from doing foolish things. He kept too much confidence in his girlfriends. What do you think? What if he had kept on talking? Don't make me laugh! I don't like that. I want tomatoes. - Bring some tomatoes. Hey, what's up? - Do your stuff alone! Bring me something to smoke. She'll recover soon. No, it says "where they were happy". I'm quite done now. No, no, I've got plenty of things to do. No, it's not that important. I just don't like to go out now. No, I just told you I want to be alone for a while. No. - I could go mad. It's not because of the work. I actually don't work, at the moment. Do you like a new one? A punch from the house. - There's not enough industry. The only industry down there is in the region of... Well, I don't know the name of the region. But further down there, up to the Chinese border, there's nothing there. That's the way it is. Punch is a great drink for a young woman, and it lifts you up. But I believe you put too much sugar in it. You get the best punch in a small bar close to Quai d'Orsay. - I always said "no". I want to talk to you. Come on, let's sit down. A Martinti. Calm down. Let me explain. You cannot do that in France. You cannot shoot around just like that like in Detroit last year. They don't do that in Paris. Let me explain. The cop's mentality in France... Bullshit. Cops are cops. - You have to know what you want. I know what I want. I want revenge. I can imagine. - I know. You don't like that. Exactly, it doesn't work. I want to ask you something which may appear indiscrete. Who's the American you met at the flight from New York a few days ago? You know who I mean? Oh, I actually don't know. You've met him again in the meantime? He was very nice, you know, but a bit shy. He never introduced himself to me. I can understand. He may have realized that he isn't the right acquaintance for the daughter of an ambassador. Even if social differences are blurred nowadays... Whatever, for sure this guy is dangerous. He is a professional killer. If you should stumble upon him, on the street or whereever, please call me immediately at this number. Don't be scared. You are being protected. Please call me at all costs. That would be it, Mademoiselle. Goodbye! You're on a lucky streak today. I continue. Here, i'll get more und i got a lot of these in my pocket. And if this runs out, i'll make a call to New York. Ok, i'll win the next game. Let's try again. Pick it up. That's it? That'll come back to me. Poker is a game where spectators interfere. Come on, continue. You can't just quit like that. Are you leaving again. I don't like it if you stay away that long. Paul? Come on, Paul. So, let's play some more. - I don't feel like it. Well, then. You got something on your mind. What's up with you. Is somebody following you, or what? Have you seen anybody? I must know that. Answer! Speak out! Tell me now what's wrong. What is wrong? I told you already I was sad. Besides I am afraid of you. I've just been walking the streets. And that I... I know that I can't change anything, but... I would like very much to be alone with you. I don't want you to go. You don't sleep? Does your shoulder still hurt? - No. You are afraid? - No I'm well and healthy. It goes like it always does with me. I can't sleep anymore. And change. What now? What do you want? Are you M. Morgan? - Yes. I am mrs von Carbona. - I have been expecting you. I,ve been looking for you. - He has never been lucky. Well. I'm sorry for that. We would certainly have worked well together. And now, what do you think you'll do? - I was with him for 10 years. He trusted me on all. And so it had to be like this. They were the last ones he had contact with. He would work with them. Therefore I give you his reasons. I will go away from Emery and from all. Emery? - Don't you know who that is? No. - You will know when you read it. You will find a long list with names of suppliers and customers. Thank you. Then we can worry about him. What is Emery like? - He has a lot of money. His wife is very rich and has good relations. Is he violent? They destroyed everything in Marcel's swimming restaurant yesterday. on the crane. I know that he's after me. I hope no one has followed you, Mrs. Keep your mouth shut. Oh, hello. Look at her, she's totally naked. Now she makes herself up. Like all women, typically. She waits for some man. Everyone is waiting for somebody. There is a cute boy, down there. Now even they start with it. He is pulling the girls hair. He is doing it on purpose so she will start crying and he can comfort her. No he is whispering something to her. Now the little girl lifts up her skirt. She is emberassed. That little brat is still quite timid. And at the end the lovers waltz. There appeared a woman on the balcony. She calls the two in the house. You can stop it slowly, we have everything that we need, all the documents. Lets go to work. - It's about time. Lets begin with those deaf-mutes. How unnecesary. Oh my god, she is totally bloody. She is dead. Whoever she was, now she is a shadow. Shadows, kingdom of shadows. Now she passed the mirror, to the other side. She has passed, from light to darkness. The darknes engulfed her. We felt very comfortable here. Tomorrow we have to leave. - That would be best. My godmother has a big house with a huge garden in Neuilly Nobody will bother us there. She lives there all alone, with an old governess. She really loves me. Nobody will look for us there. You'll stay here, it's too dangerous. I will send notice, when everything is done. Nobody will find out anyway. It's not the first time. Aren't you afraid? Afraid? No, why? Nothing will happen to us. I want to talk to you. - Who is talking? I am not here. Don't nother me. Where is that voice coming from? I don't want to hear that. When does the next delivery arrive? Answer! I don't know. - Who's your distributor? Lacan, the opera's dancer. Breathe deeply. Come on. Shoulders back. Look, like that. Breathe deeply now. Now stop. One, two, three, four, five, and exhale. Well, come on. They will let you in. Come on, little thing, nothing will happen to you if you stay with us. Does Lacan live here? He doesn't live here, but he stays here most of the the time. Sit down. I want to see you. I've heard about you in Rome. I am totally done. I'm in desperate need for some stuff. I already tried weed. But that doesn't suffice. I need something better, something stronger. I urgently need something else. The best stuff. - Yes, I understand. I hope you can help me. - Let me see what I can do. It's really urgent. I understand. I can understand your situation. So I can trust you? I'll see what I can do. But I really need it badly. Well, that's a problem. Please. You should have brought me with you. Shut up. We will get him. Sucker. I believe we are being followed. Hold fast, I turn right. I will park somewhere here. That's at least something. Keep observing, but be careful. No, that's all. I'll drive home now. Call me every three hours. Thanks. Attention, duck down! Why, but why? And two... and three... and four. One, two, and three, and four. Where's the Lab? Come on, what's the adress! Where's the Lab? At the factory... shortly before the Cam?? Where does the delivery arrive, and when? That payed off. And Paul? - He'll always get through. Come on! To Neuilly, to your aunt. Dirty swine! And you also told him when the delivery from Beirut is arriving. That's just typical for you. You told him everything, uhmm? The place, the date, everything! - No. No, I don't know the date at all. And what about the Lab? He also knows about that. You told him everything. - No, really no. So you say. Emery. Leave that to me. I'm in charge of that now. No, that's my business. I cover that. He's gonna pay. You will pay for this, I'll tell you. This will finish you dinner societies. Now he's going to puke. I already knows what to expect. And how do we proceed now? - See for some concrete and a delivery truck. No! - Topple him somewhere into the creek. Get rid of him. If I have had a room for myself when I was young, even if it would have been just a shed, maybe everything would be totally different today. I always had a vast one. - That's why you are different. I always had the feeling that you look down on me. You keep your head high. You look at me, come to me, so close to me. I love that smell surrounding you Like old perfume, a bit sweetish. It fascinates like a spell. You let yourself fall and find yourself somewhere else. Maybe I'd be happy in a Southern country. Under the sun, at the sea... You lie on your back, look at the shifting clouds , and listen to the sound of the waves. Why don't you go there with me? Today, now. Right now. Nobody can stop you if you want that. Come on! I found you after all. And I know exactly where the Lab is. I'll bet the stuff is hidden here. I've already looked there. It smells shitty here. Sorry. Pardon me. Everything okay? You're happy now? Come on, it stinks here. Stop! Stop! Come quick! Quick, bring him in here. Quiet, quiet please. - Sometimes I want to end it all. I haven't had anything since two days. And then I hadn't had the courage any more. You can go. - I'm not to blame, you understand? Yes, I understand, but... But why do you do that? Because... I absolutely know what's going on. Your date didn't work out. The guy hasn't been there. Yes, exactly, otherwise I would be like anybody else. I'll be back on my feet soon. I am quite reasonable. Only when I don't get anything, I'll become crazy. Well, I understand. Do you know that your delivery man is in prison. - And where should I... No, no, don't worry, we care for you. Nobody could stand quitting from one moment to the other. I am going to help you. Then you got to help us, too. I already do everything. Hey, boss, they have beaten the Lab into pieces. So what? I know that. This will be done my way. You get what you need from us. - Now. Immediately. Who's your supplier? This guy from the opera. - Fine. Well. Everything will be okay. I'll do this on my own, absolutely on my own. This is what I wanted to tell you. You have to understand. I really don't want to be the odd job man all my life. I am fed up by New York and the Mafia. It was ok, when i was your age. But now... I understand that. I cannot resent you. I am so happy about that, and I will stay by your side. I'm fed up with them too. They think they can get away with everything. We both don't need them. You and me - we don't need no one. We will alway get along, Serge. Paul, I don't want you to be involved with that. I'll make them on my own. - But I won't let you on your own. She's behind that, uhm? Yes. I pack in this stuff because of you. You cannot drop out just like that. I just leave and that's it. And what are you going to do then? You never cared for anything. Nothing made a difference to you. You are living in another world. You've never been totally "on". Nothing ever touched you. Do you really think it will be different with her? - Yes. The Mafia will never forgive you that. They will find you. But that's very strange. People die like flies since this American has arrived. Every morning I ask myself who will be the next. Haven't you read the papers? Massacre at Fontainebleau woods: Shooting in a night club: Shooting at a chicken farm: 5 dead. I eventually was told that you know the proprietor well. Bullshit. I got the impression that you cannot cope with this thing. You don't get any further. You are incapable. I begin to be fed up with this. - Calm down, calm down, Mr. Emery. Hard words. The department chief told me, that you are obviously very interested in these things. If that's so, one has to take precautions. Maybe we should put you under police protection. I will send you two policemen. Just for you. For your protection. If I consider it necessary... - Well, just call me. But, please, be careful. Should something happen to you, my department chief would surely never forgive me. Swine. Do you have to play cards all the time? Don't you have anything better to do? Hey, you want to see my cards? You want to see what a lousy card I have? Hey, come on, keep it cool. That would be a great card. There's your shit. This makes me sick. If you want to fuss around, drink at another place. Ok! Ok, ok. Ok. Come on, you pigs! I kick you in the face. If you want to deal with me, you'll have to get up earlier. I have their guardian angels in front of the door. Do you believe your safe because of that? I will tell you what I want. I want everything. Think about it. I'll call you again. This was an invitation? -Yes. You could call it that way. Everything I have done disgusts me. Sometimes I don't remember anything. As if I cannot think. I would have to start all over again, that is... Everything goes on the same. No, it's not like before. You wouldn't have said something like this before. You always kept everything to yourself. You never gave a thought to anything. If you'll have finished this business... you can end the whole thing and be totally happy. I would like to believe that. There are people whose life goes on straight. Everyone has a destined duty. I shouldn't try that at all. No one can trick oneself, that's impossible. Anyway, I have made some nice journeys together with you. No, he doesn't care about you anymore. New York is over, and Mafia too. Since when? Since this girl appeared. - So you want to kill him? No, no, It's better to wait. It's like that since I'm here. It's crazy. Even if we are in the port I shouldn't leave the ship. I just don't want to know, where we are or in which country. I don't mind. I would dream about countries which don't exist anymore. Countries which aren't on maps anymore. Only at Jule Verne's. Yes, but that's why I didn't come to Paris. No, absolutely not! Wether I am a good shooter or not, is totally... This has nothing to do with that. No, I want to return to New York. Then we'll send another one to finish the business. An other one? Why? No, no. Either me or no one. Are you worried? Something didn't go well? You don't have any money? I'm leaving. I'm fed up. I quit. I leave everything. I am actually happy. Sometimes this had to happen. It was a good lesson to me. When I think about the plans I had with my life... I wanted the big adventure. - And now? What are your plans now? To be honest we haven't learned anything. You cannot turn back the time. Don't we want to leave somewhere, anywhere? - We have dreamt with open eyes. The aircraft is already gone. I knew it wouldn't be that easy with you. You gotta do what's kept inside you. Delete and destroy. Your're not inwardly free before you've done that. Not before. There's more. That's not that bad. We sure will give you something. Stay seated. Well, that is clear now. You know it's in your interest. - Yes. Wether it's in my interest or not. That's not what it's about, it's about me leaving. Do what you want to do. That's out of the question. I still need you. We'll see afterwards. That's not necessary anymore. I am leaving. You won't leave. The American is surely going to call you, And you are going to make an appointment with him. I am sorry, but you have to look for another one for this. I am leaving. Goodbye, Mr. Bardeche. - You won't come far, Emery. Until now you had support from many people. But from now one no one can do anything for you. But me. If things get too dangerous, the love is going to end. You have no more friends then. They will abandon you. You will do what I say, then you can leave. So? I have found a safe place for your appointment. The police yard. So, please. What else can I do for you? Think about it. I have been helpful all the time. And when I can help you by this... Okay, I am ready to leave the field. That means... there's one condition. We will meet each other in person. At a neutral place, where nothing can happen to either of us. It's time, yes? Okay. Leave me alone, Everything is okay. Leave me alone. I choke. I always choke in closed rooms. A disease. I don't stand to be closed down. This is why I have to leave the room from time to time. I need life around me. That's the way I am. I've got everything. And I lose it. You can be paralyzed all of a sudden. You can't do anything about it. You even cannot cry. "Very beneficial". She's going to break her neck. What a pity. I cannot do it. This little bitch. Serge, take that...
