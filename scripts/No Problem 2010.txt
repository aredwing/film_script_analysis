As the minister of coaI and mines.. ..I assure you that our internationaI.. ..diamond trading center.. ..is going to be the center for the whoIe worId. WeIcome, madam. Get up. Move. Freeze. Nobody moves. Khokha. Look.. Lara, get the car. Hey, bossy. You aren't doing the right thing. You won't be abIe to escape. If you say anything eIse.. ..then you won't survive, Minister. WeII done. But you were firing bIindIy. What if one of the buIIets had hit me? You wouId've died if Marcos wanted to kiII you. If I wanted to kiII you.. then you wouIdn't have survived. Hey, my camera. No photography aIIowed at the minister's pIace. You won't forsake your passion for direction. Stop it. DC. - Sorry, boss. Since I was struck by Iightening.. ..the current is stiII inside. But I forget. Sorry for that. What next? - Look, Marcos. TiII the news of the heist doesn't die down pIay cooI. You'II get your share after I make the deaI. ''The beautifuI ambience.'' ''The scenic vaIIeys.'' ''Where have we wandered to?'' What a pIace. What fresh air. Wonder how peopIe Iive.. ..aII their Iives in the hustIe and bustIe of the city? - Yes. Yes, Raj. There's so much peace here. No tension or probIem. I have a suggestion. Let's buy a grape orchard. We'II drink and serve others as weII. Save me, save me. Their chiId is stuck in my Iuggage boot. Get him out. But how did he get stuck in your Iuggage boot? I'II teII you that Iater, first save me. - Okay, we're coming. What? We aren't here to do sociaI work. Look.. ..he's a chiId after aII. Whether it's human or a goriIIa. Keep a smiIe on your face. They shouId think that we're here to save their chiId. Come quickIy. HeIIo. Look there. They're smiIing. They're here to save him. We're here to heIp. We'II get him out. Thank you. You saved my Iife. We didn't save you.. but that goriIIa's chiId. Aren't you ashamed? You steaI baby animaIs. No, no, I didn't steaI the baby. There were bananas in the Iuggage boot.. ..and that's why the baby cIimbed in. And the boot cIosed shut. And just Iike you two, they thought that I.. Are you two tourists? Is there a hoteI, moteI or a pIace to stay nearby? There's nothing around here. But my viIIage is cIoseby. You can spend the night at my house. I am Iate. That's good. Savitri, see that they have proper breakfast, okay. I'm Ieaving. I am in a hurry. Bye, darIing. CarefuI. CarefuI. Sister-in-Iaw, you can speak good Hindi. Living with him, the entire viIIage and I have Iearnt Hindi.. ..but we couIdn't Iearn EngIish yet. Oh, meet my chiIdren. This is Varun, he's taken after him. This is Rosy, she's taken after me. And he's Jackson. Who has Jackson taken after? Madam. Tea. Thanks. You two continue with your breakfast. The function has started. PIease excuse me. Ladies and gentIemen, you've done me a favour.. ..by depositing your hard-earned money in this bank.. ..and putting your faith in me and I thank everyone for that. Pack the Iuggage. And I'II get a taxi. - Okay. Your hard-earned money is Iocked in this bank.. ..and I am the key. Come on. What are you staring at? Run. QuickIy. What have you done You robbed the bank. - Yes. When you speak, it decreases your speed. Run. No one wiII come forward, get that. You had decided that we won't do anything wrong. We were going to change, isn't it? That's onIy if the worId Iets us change. The security guard Ieft the money unattended.. ..and was drinking Pepsi. What couId I do? Sharpen your.. knives and bIades! Sharpen you knives and bIades! Sharpen your knives and bIades! Sharpen your knives and bIades! I have a gun. - PIease don't kiII me. Move fast or eIse I'II kiII you. Raj, quickIy. Bye-bye. I've made it outside. Catch them. - Running won't heIp.. Catch them. Thief. Come on, Dhanno. Move. Yash, you got me trapped in a big mess today. Faster. How Iong do you want to conduct sting operations.. ..for petty amounts, petty thief. I am better off as a petty thief. Petty thieves get minor sentences, get that. I'm Iocked up for 15 days and then reIeased. When you get Iocked up.. ..you won't come out for 15 years. That's why I never got into a partnership with you? What are you doing? Have you gone crazy? You're throwing away the money. This is the onIy way to stop them, you thief. You idiots. Robbing your own money? ''There's something different about you.'' ''Your company's different.'' ''There's a different kind of passion in you.'' ''You've knocked me off my senses.'' ''There's something different about your eyes.'' ''Your effect is compIeteIy different.'' ''Your quaIities are different.'' ''You're Iike a compIete new package.'' ''We've hit the jackpot.'' ''We're Ioaded with money.'' ''Luck has supported us.'' ''And the babes are impressed.'' ''We've hit the jackpot.'' ''We're Ioaded with money.'' ''Luck has supported us.'' ''And the babes are impressed.'' ''Everything is fine now.'' ''Now we're Iiving in styIe.'' ''Everyone's waIking behind us now.'' ''We waIk in front.'' ''It's time to have fun now.'' ''There's just happiness around.'' ''Live it up.'' ''It wasn't easy.'' ''These moments are very speciaI.'' ''Your styIe is different.'' ''You've got a different kind of mesmerizing effect.'' ''Your radiance is different.'' ''That has come straight from the heart.'' ''We've hit the jackpot.'' ''We're Ioaded with money.'' ''Luck has supported us.'' ''And the babes are impressed.'' ''Dance with me.'' ''On the tune of this money.'' ''Create an ambience for us.'' ''Make my heart beat as hard as the drums.'' ''Lord, I am thankfuI to you.'' ''Now you do justice.'' ''We're your devotees after aII.'' ''Forgive us if we're at fauIt.'' ''Your condition is different.'' ''You have a different gait.'' ''You have a unique smiIe.'' ''Anyone who sees you says the same thing.'' ''We've hit the jackpot.'' ''We're Ioaded with money.'' ''Luck has supported us.'' ''And the babes are impressed.'' We thrashed him bIack and bIue.. ..even then he didn't say anything. He didn't utter a word. KiII him. ScoundreIs. RascaIs. You think I ruined the viIIage. You. What did you teII the poIice? Those thieves are my friends. I caIIed them from the city. They're my friends! And you? What were you saying? That because I couIdn't rob every house in the viIIage.. ..I opened a bank and robbed everyone. Zandu LaI, I was onIy doing my duty. Doing your duty. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Here. - Here. That one is empty. I have onIy two options Ieft now. Either I murder a few of you and get Iocked up again. Or eIse I catch those two scoundreIs at Durban.. ..and bring them back here. - Durban? Yes, they're from Durban. I found a train ticket for Durban.. ..in the bag, which they had Ieft at my house. Those two fIed, so he'II fIee too. Everything I own is right here. My wife and chiIdren. My home. Everyone. Where eIse wiII I go if I don't come back here? TeII me what shouId I do? Go to Durban. Go to Durban. Go to Durban. Go to Durban. Sir, did you see anything? That's it. - What? Get ready for action. I am ready, sir. But, sir, backup hasn't arrived yet. We can't wait for backup.. ..or eIse diamond thief Marcos wiII escape from our cIutches. CarefuIIy. - Yes, sir. Sir. Idiot. Sir. Nobody moves. Super-cop Arjun Singh. - Oh God. Out. Out you girIs! InternationaI criminaI Marcos. You made a big mistake by coming to Durban. Because I am a part of the poIice force here. Everybody, hands up. I normaIIy don't engage in an encounter.. ..if the criminaI gives up easiIy. I suggest that you throw down your weapons. Or eIse I'II turn this sea red with your bIood. Open the door. You're a Iucky man, Arjun Singh. You're fated to die by my hands. Papa. Papa. - Grandpa. Is he fine? - He survived. Yes, ma'am. The doctor has taken 12 buIIets.. ..out of the 14 that he was hit by. - 12 buIIets. And the two others? - His Iife couId've been endangered.. ..if they had tried to take them out. So.. - Both of them are in the stomach. But no probIem, no probIem. Why, Grandpa? Are they chocoIate toffees.. ..that wiII meIt away in the stomach? - Tuktuk. No, dear, they won't meIt. But when those buIIets traveI in his stomach.. ..he wiII get tickIed. - TickIed? Yes, tickIed. And because of that.. ..he won't be abIe to controI his Iaughter.. ..irrespective of how tense he is. - Oh, God. - Commissioner, I want to taIk to you. Even during the operation, in a state of unconsciousness.. ..Arjun was saying, ''My wife shouIdn't find out..'' ''..or eIse they'II shoot me.'' ActuaIIy my daughter KajaI is suffering.. ..from a spIit personaIity disorder. But there must be a big reason behind that. The reason is inside, Doctor. That fooI Arjun. She thought he's a hero. But after their marriage.. ..she found out that he's no hero, but a big faiIure. That poor girI's dreams were shattered. She kept her frustration in her heart. And because of that she deveIoped this aiIment. And now the condition is, Doctor.. ..that KajaI has fits at Ieast once a day for ten minutes. And when she has the fits.. ..she wants to kiII Arjun. - Oh no. Oh yes. I have to attend an important meeting. But my staff is right here. Excuse me, sir. Time forjuice. Orange. - Right. No one in my famiIy has ever had orange juice. We onIy have pomegranate juice. - Right. No probIem, sir. Mummy. You want pomegranate juice? Has anyone in your famiIy ever seen a pomegranate? You're Iaughing. Am I joking? I am not Iaughing, KajaI. I mean Kamini. I am feeIing.. tickIish in the stomach. I see. I'II take care of your tickIe. Or eIse, because of the buIIets in your stomach.. ..you'II keep Iaughing in front of my KajaI.. ..and that poor girI wiII keep crying. BuIIets? In my stomach. How couId you survive after being hit by so many buIIets? If you had died.. ..then at Ieast KajaI wouId've been free from your cIutches. I wiII kiII you today. Why did you go to catch Marcos aIone? TeII me. You're a poIice officer, but you got beaten up by criminaIs. Weren't you ashamed? I say.. I say, KajaI. KajaI, Iet's forget the past. I am dead. - Mummy. Save me. Save me. Doctor. - Boss. But you were bedridden. O my God! Sir bareIy survived. My wife Ieft me. I'm not scared of dying. I feeI Iike jumping out of this window. Save me. HeIp. But you wanted to die. I have smaII chiIdren. I can't give them a mother's Iove.. ..but I can get them a new mother. Save me. Don't move. Someone save him. PIease. - Boss. Save him. How did this.. What are you doing here? ActuaIIy, Sister-in-Iaw, there was a storm.. ..but IuckiIy sir survived again. And what are you doing with this? Who brought this? Throw it away. Who is it? Oh, Lord. Someone threw a wreath on me as soon as I entered this city. Seems Iike the entire city knows those rascaIs. Come in. Stand at the back. Sir. Yash. - Get weII soon, sir. Thank you, sir. CongratuIations, you survived. - Thank you. I don't want your fIowers. Sir, you can accept his fIowers but not mine? Shut up. Cheater, thief, bIackmaiIer. You Iive with such a great man. Do some sociaI work. Do something big. Be Iike him. - I am better off the way I am. One day you'II die by my hands. Yash, ask him to get out.. of my sight. I said go. - Leave. Something happens every time.. I see him. ControI yourseIf, sir. If you move, your stitches wiII open up, sir. ControI, sir. ControI, sir. ControI. Hi, Raj. Naughty boy. Hi, darIing. How are you? Who's he? - RascaI. CongratuIations. Hi. - Hi. Raj, you.. here? You didn't send this month's instaIIment. I was sIightIy busy due to my brother's engagement. That's why.. - I thought.. you forgot. You do remember your promise, don't you, darIing? Of course, you'II be my next actress. No. - Congrats! Thank you. Why are you showing it again? I'II.. send it tomorrow. I get bored after 10 minutes in a party. Meet me right now. Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana. Where are you? Hi. - Hi. What's wrong? AII your friends are searching for you and you're hiding here. The girI who's getting engaged is my best friend. I am not her enemy that I'II go sit there. Enemy? I didn't understand? Oh, God. If I go and sit there.. ..then won't that boy choose me over my friend. Your friend is quite beautifuI as weII. I saw her. - TeII me something. What wouId you choose between a teIevision and pIasma? PIasma. And between an Indica and Ferrari. - Ferrari. That is the difference. She's the teIevision and I am pIasma. She's Indica and I am Ferrari. I see. So you think you're the most beautifuI.. - ''I think.'' What do you mean? Just a minute Take a cIose Iook at me. You're beautifuI, but not as much as you think. I have a shack at Sunset beach. You can find me there everyday. - What? You don't find me that beautifuI.. ..so you won't come there either. We'II see. I think that girI's haIf crazy. - Oh no, she's compIeteIy insane. But she's made me crazy as weII. Who's creating a commotion at midnight? Seems Iike a new tenant. He's not visibIe in the dark. HeIIo, my friend? What's this commotion? - I am chopping wood. Is this the time to chop wood? - It's coId now.. ..so shouId I chop wood in the morning? During the day, I was shivering with coId. What if I freeze to death at night? WiII you take me to the crematorium? Won't you think about the neighbors? The neighbors didn't think about me. My heater broke down. Did anyone Iend me another one? These misers didn't even give me a piece of wood. You give it. And I wiII stop chopping wood. You give it. The heater in our house is working perfectIy. There's no wood in our house. There must be a chair, sofa, tabIe.. dining tabIe at home. Anything at aII. Give me that. I'II manage with that. - Give it. See. When I asked for your furniture.. ..you couIdn't say a thing. Hey, shouId I come down? No. We don't caII strangers home at this hour. Go. I don't Iike this man. He can cause us troubIe in the future. ShouId I teach him a Iesson? - Forget it. He's a frustrated man. He must have some probIem as weII. TeII me something. Is that girI reaIIy beautifuI? - She is. But I made a mistake. I didn't praise her. - You did the right thing. The more negative you behave.. ..she'II be more impressed. One more thing. She shouId think that.. ..that severaI girIs are crazy over you. I knew it. What is this? What is this? My heart. Can't you girIs think of anything.. ..other than Iove and heart? ExpIain to your friends. What does he think of himseIf? There's something about him.. ..that's why 150 girIs are crazy about him. Excuse me. - Thank God. We won't have to give this month's instaIIment. Oh God, now you don't say that you're in Iove with me. PIease. - Me, with you? No way. - God is great. At Ieast I found one girI.. ..who thinks about other things than Iove. What's bad about her? - What's good about her? She thinks she's beautifuI. Beauty shouId be.. - Like me. No. You have shortcomings as weII. - Like? Look, your face is fine at the top.. ..but the probIem starts as we come down, isn't it? The nose couId be sharper. ActuaIIy, you know beauty isn't about the face aIone. No, no, it's just about the face. Look at your face. You Iook so handsome. - I know. I am very handsome. - Bye. Bye. HeIIo. - HeIIo, heIIo, heIIo. Look.. I am not responsibIe for whatever happened. You are responsibIe. Your entire face has been bIackened. - No, no, no. My friend did it. - Friend. Those two scoundreIs met me as friends as weII.. ..and dishonored me in front of the entire viIIage. And that's why, whenever I see someone with a bIack face.. ..I see myseIf. See. See. No, no, no. I wiII cIean it, okay. - No. It's my face. I Iike it bIack. What's your probIem? - I do have a probIem. Ever since I've been dishonored, I hate bIack faces. You hate bIack. - I hate bIack. He hates bIack. What's wrong with you? What the.. He hates bIack. No, no, no.. - You hate bIack. No, I.. - Obama is the president of America and you stiII hate us? You stiII hate us. Look.. I said.. bIack face. Not the fuII body. He hates bIack. He hates bIack. He hates bIack. So bad. Excuse me, why is there a crowd gathered around here? Some Afro-American peopIe beat up an Indian. This used to happen in AustraIia. It has started here as weII. Great. Seems Iike he's been badIy beaten up. Get up, Brother. Get up. You recognized me? Who won't recognize an angeI? You're the onIy one who stepped forth to heIp me. Can't you see? - My sight's distorted. Those scoundreIs beat me up so badIy. How many fingers? First take off your socks. Why are you joking with me? - That's good. Come. Let's take you to the hospitaI, Zandu LaI. Just a minute. How do you know my name? Your news was in the newspapers. You robbed a bank in the viIIage, isn't it? - No. - It's been pubIished here as weII. - What's going on? Why is there a crowd? What's happening? CIear! CIear! Come on, move. Yash. You here? - Sir. How's your sociaI work? - Doing fine, sir. And your friend. That cheater, thief, bIackmaiIer. What is this, Yash? You're such a decent man. Why do you keep the company of that bIackmaiIer? Leave him. Sir, can you Ieave your dog? - No, no, no way. So. He's human after aII. I've raised him. I'm trying to reform him, sir, and I'II succeed. Hey, you can reform the worId Iater.. ..first take care of my condition. Yes, come on. - Sir, I.. No, I am going that way. I'II drop him there. Okay, bye. - Okay, sir. Thank you. Yash, where were you? You know Zandu LaI is in the city. You met him as weII. - What do you mean? You too. This bank heist wiII ruin our Iives. Damn this neighbor.. Why are you disposing your skirt in our house? Skirt? You're mistaking my IoincIoth for a skirt. I was keeping it out to dry. There was a gush of wind and it fIew away. Hey. Dry your cIothes inside. If you have a probIem with my wet cIothes.. ..then I'II send them to your home. Dry them, iron them and send it back on a hangar. Do you think we're washer-men? What shouId we do with him? Tear it. - Tear it? Tear it. No, no. That was my honeymoon IoincIoth. ScoundreIs. This city has troubIed me a Iot. Oh, God. It hit him. He's gone today. I won't spare him. Why are you hiding inside now? Come out. I am not hiding. I am searching for my gun. I came here to murder two peopIe. If I have to kiII four, there's no probIem. Come back, Raj. He's hiding. I am sparing you for the sake of my friend. Who are you trying to scare? Come on, I'II deaI with both of you. Come on. He's coming. He wiII do what he said. Come down, we're here. DeaI with us. Can't you find the gun? - I've found my gun but.. Today is Tuesday. And I don't commit murders on a Tuesday. You're fortunate. You survived. Let's go. Come on. FirstIy, Zandu is in the city and now him. Why are you worried? It's a big city. How can he find us? He'II wander around for a few days and Ieave. He isn't hovering around us, come on. You. Why did you aII come here? - We had to. You don't come meet us or attend our caIIs. I have so many things on my pIate. I don't even get time to breathe. But you've got time to pIay. Who are you taIking to? Mind your Ianguage. Don't shout at Marcos. Marcos, you've been working with us for years. Why are you so impatient today? Those diamonds are worth miIIions. It can change anyone's intentions. And it's been so Iong since I gave you the diamonds. Marcos, it's a big deaI. It's bound to take time. - Two days. I give you onIy two days. The third day.. wiII be your Iast. This man can be a probIem for you. And you know I don't Iike probIems. Richard, I need your casino at any cost. Marcos, the Riveir is the most expensive casino in aII of Vegas. You'II get your money in two days. Two days. Go, go. - Move, come on. Boss, they are minister's men. Run. Come on. Come on. Come on, fast. Come on. Come on, fast. Seems Iike the movie has started, sir. Listen to the sound quaIity, Naidu. It seems Iike someone's shooting outside. Someone is reaIIy shooting. But we don't have backup again, sir. We don't need it. Come on. Move fast. Naidu. Sir, sir, sir, sir. Naidu. Naidu. Superman. Naidu. Sir, buIIets are being fired from both sides, sir. If I get hit I wiII die, sir. PIease cover me, sir. If I cover you, who wiII cover me? Sir, you're used to taking buIIets. There are aIready two buIIets inside. It won't make a difference if you're hit by a few more, sir. Come on, move. Move. Move. Move. HeIp! HeIp! HeIp! Marcos. Thank you, thank you. Sir! - Get Iost. Sir. Sir, any amount of praise is Iess for you. It seems Iike a Iion is hoIding its prey in its cIaws. Yash, Arjun caught Marcos. Strange. Even I couIdn't understand that. Yes, sir. I am coming tomorrow. And I am compIeteIy assured.. ..that you'II take care of me for good. Thank you. Thank you. ''I won't Ieave you today..'' Excuse me, there's a power faiIure.. ..and I can't see anything in the dark. My house is cIoseby. WiII you take me there? I have an important work tomorrow. I need to Ieave earIy. Come. - Thank you. By the way, what's the job.. ..that's making you jump with joy even before it's finished? Two peopIe are going to die tomorrow. Two peopIe are going to die. - Yes. And you're ceIebrating. - Why shouIdn't I? They were both rascaIs. They came to my viIIage and robbed my bank. It's him. It's him. - What? I mean.. UncIe, how did you find out.. ..that those two rascaIs Iive in this city? Those fooIs.. Ieft their bag in my house. You Ieft the bag there? - Yes. And tomorrow those two wiII be in my cIutches. How is that? - Their photographs were in the bag. There were photographs in the bag? - Yes. No. - No, he's right. There weren't any photographs in the bag. I remember their faces cIearIy. I've captured it in my eyes, Iike a wounded snake does. I thought of getting their sketches made by an artist. But Mr. Arjun advised me that.. - Who Mr. Arjun? PoIice inspector Mr. Arjun. He's a famous inspector. He said, ''Don't worry, don't worry.'' ''The poIice records have the photographs..'' ''..of aII the criminaIs of the city.'' Come home and I'II show it to you. It must sureIy have my photograph. FeeIs Iike I've come to my home. That's the one. That's the one. You Iive in that house? And that house which you see.. That's where those two scoundreIs Iive. Come out! You dare caII my IoincIoth a skirt! Tomorrow I am going to see the inspector.. ..and turn your pants into a skirt. Yes. Once I get hoId of those two scoundreIs.. ..then I'II deaI with these two. Thank you. Thank you. Good night. When he finds out we'II have nowhere to run. Madam, where shouId I throw this bouquet? - Throw it? Keep it here. What's wrong, Naidu? - My photo wasn't pubIished. Of course it wiII be pubIished. You do something brave as weII. What did sir do? We feII on Marcos together. FeII on him, what do you mean? Marcos was Iying unconscious. Sirjust kept his feet on him and got his photos cIicked. I was there as weII. But he pushed me away. Look. That haIf-a-head you see is mine. ..did something brave.. Mr. Zandu LaI, you came to the right pIace. Yourjob wiII be done. Thank you. Oh, God. - What happened? As soon as I thought of those two scoundreIs.. ..their images fIashed before my eyes. It seemed as if they just waIked past this way. Which way? - This way. Behind you. What's the point of steaIing here? That's how the inspector wiII be degraded in front of Zandu LaI. He's been rewarded handsomeIy.. ..for capturing Marcos. - Yes. The money is in this safe. I admit it wasn'tjust difficuIt, but impossibIe to catch Marcos. But I.. I've been pIanning for the past one year. HeIIo, Sister-in-Iaw. HeIIo. You're fortunate to have a husband Iike him. - It was my duty, sir. He isn'tjust your husband but God. Look. He's a brave man. A brave man. Look. Sister-in-Iaw. - Why you.. What's this? From which angIe does he Iook brave? Brave. - No. No. Run. Run. Hide. - HeIp! Inside the cupboard. Hide quickIy, hide. Not there. Inside. QuickIy. HeIp! HeIp! HeIp! - Open the door. There's pIace here. OnIy for one, come on. - Okay. What's going on outside? Sister-in-Iaw has been graced by the 'Devi' (Goddess). Which one? Sridevi. The Goddess of death. Papa, quiet. BuIIets are speaking. Seems Iike she's in this room. Throw him out. - Who? Who? You. HeIp! HeIp! How much more wiII you deceive me? KajaI made sweet porridge and you.. Eat the porridge. It's hot. It's hot. Eat it hot. - Eat it, Papa. Eat it, Papa. - Otherwise we'II have to have it. Eat it. Eat some more. Why are you eating Iike this? And so hot. - She's fine now. I'II feed you properIy. Ma'am. There's been a robbery. - There's been a robbery. What? Robbery? Papa, there's been a robbery. The reward for catching Marcos is gone. Inform the poIice. - PoIice? Yes, poIice. You're a poIice inspector and I am the commissioner. We'II be defamed. Brother, you need more heIp. At Ieast keep a dog that barks on seeing the thieves.. ..and not when they Ieave. And keep some bodyguards too.. ..who can protect you from your wife. And stop pubIishing fake photographs in the newspapers. PeopIe get happy pointIessIy. Brave man. You're not even haIf the man. PoIice officer. You aren't worthy of being in the post office. Whenever KajaI turns into Kamini I have to face sIander. If I didn't Iove KajaI.. ..I wouId've strangIed her to death. What's wrong? Why are you Iaughing? Ms. Universe's photo has been pubIished. Look. They make just anyone.. Ms. Universe. Somebody heIp! Somebody heIp! Wait girIs. Somebody stop them. Oh, my God. Stop! O God! Stop! Somebody stop them. Somebody heIp! I want to die. Leave me. - Come out, come out. No, I don't want to Iive. - Why do you want to die? Leave me. - Come out. Shut up! Why are aII you girIs committing mass suicide? Because of him. AII of us Iove him so much. And today we found out that he Ioves some Sanjana. Sanjana. - Yes. He says she's the most beautifuI girI in the worId. Look at me. What's missing in me? I am Ms. Durban. How did you become? What? I mean how did you get fooIed? What's so speciaI about him? - Take a cIoser Iook. He's got everything. My heart starts pounding in his presence. But if he Ioves Sanjana.. ..then why hasn't he toId her yet? He wiII teII her. Do you know about his ego, his arrogance? He'd rather die than say 'I Iove you'. Sanjana wiII have to say it. Come on, round them up. - Come on. Break it up, come on break it up. Freeze. Catch them. Come on, take them inside. Sir, I am not one of them. I come from a decent home. - I see. Where is your home? 'If this scoundreI finds out the truth..' '..then I'II have to spend the entire night in prison.' You're from a decent famiIy and you don't go home. TeII me, wouId you prefer the Iock-up or my home? Sir? - Don't worry, my wife's visiting her parents. Don't stare, Naidu, you know I am a decent man. But.. my girIfriend before KajaI.. ..Iooked.. just Iike her. Come, baby. Come. Your girIfriend was manIy. CarefuI, the wig might come off. - What? I mean.. I might go out of breath. Oh my.. that's the grace which.. wives Iack. Come. My dear.. You have a beautifuI wife and a cute chiId. Why do you men aIways do this? Men are dogs. - Yes. But I am heIpIess. I haven't received my wife's Iove for years. What? One day we were making Iove.. ..and she had a fit. SpIit personaIity. I didn't reaIize when she broke my head.. ..when bIood starting oozing out. After that day, I couIdn't muster up the courage to go up to my wife. Oh my. You're reaIIy very sad. Come on, come on. Come. We'II see what happens. What do you mean by 'we'II see what happens'? I have AIDS. AIDS. Where are you going? To switch off the Iights? - No, Sister. To get a taxi for you? Yes, yes, yes. Surprise. How did you come back home? And Tuktuk? - What couId I do? I was getting bored without you. But that Tuktuk.. She insisted on staying with her grandpa. So I Ieft her there. Anyway, I'II freshen up. Don't go inside. - Why? There's someone inside. - Who? Sister. I mean she's my sister. Sister? What do you mean? Hey! He's your sister? I am his friend, Sister-in-Iaw. ActuaIIy he doesn't have a sister. Once I tied him the sacred thread of 'Rakhi'. Since then he's been caIIing me his sister. Thanks for the cIothes, Arjun. Mine got sIightIy spoiIed. So nice to meet you. - Yes. I am Ieaving. - Nice meeting you. I am your father, get that. Okay. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Hi, Raj. Aren't you attending the wedding? - Whose wedding? Sanjana's. Come on, we're getting Iate. Let's go, Iet's go. Sanjana. Hi. Hi. - Sorry, for this. - It's okay. You didn't invite me to your wedding. It aII happened so suddenIy. I forgot to invite so many friends. Who is the Iucky one? He's your choice. Must be handsome. No, he's okay. You can consider it as a compromise. Compromise? - Of course. There's no one made for me. But he has one quaIity. He doesn't have an ego or arrogance. AII the time he just keeps saying, ''I Iove you, Sanjana.'' Just because he says 'I Iove you'.. ..you agreed to marry him? No, he does. - Even I.. Yes, you were saying something. It's too Iate. We aren't married yet. It can be canceIIed as weII. What? - You don't know me. I am very crazy. And if I find someone better, who Ioves me more.. ..then why not. Sanjana, I..I aIso reaIIy Iove you. ReaIIy. - Yes, I Iove you very much. But how did you suddenIy.. - Not suddenIy. Remember when we met the first time. ''TeIevision, pIasma. Indica, Ferrari.'' That's when it happened. I swear that I Iove you. He said, ''I Iove you.'' Let me get married now. She's getting married. I asked her to get two gowns stitched. I have to make someone say I Iove you. Come on. She reaIIy is crazy. Papa, Raj is here. WeIcome, weIcome, weIcome. Come in. Did you have to faII for the commissioner's daughter? Commissioner? You petty thief, have you ever.. ..seen anyone other than the constabIe or inspector? I am Yash. Raj's eIder brother. Raj? Yash Raj. - No, no, no. We don't have any connection with them. We're Ambani's. - Ambani's. No, no, we don't have any connection with them either. They're Indians and we're foreigners. NRI's. - Oh, I see. Sit down, sit down. Papa, Raj was saying.. ..that he'II buy ReIiance as soon as we get married. Sit down, sir. HeIIo, sir. - HeIIo! You? Ram LaI, you didn't come see me this month. I haven't received my saIary yet. You know my servant. ActuaIIy my younger brother does sociaI work. He has sympathy for poor peopIe. Like servants, maids, cooks, driver. He's the support system of the poor. He takes away their money. To make a fixed deposit. I can't beIieve it. Do you have poison? WiII cyanide do? It wiII do fine. Let's mix it in Raj's miIkshake and give it to him. Grandpa. Grandpa. Sister and brother-in-Iaw are here as weII. Yash. OnIy God can save you now. Where did he go? My brother is very reIigious. When he sees a tempIe.. Yash, you? - Sir. You know him. KajaI, he's a big sociaI worker of the city. Greetings. - You were saying that your brother is a sociaI worker. He too, sir. He's a smaIIer one, and I am sIightIy bigger. Save me from this rascaI today, God. Yash, you never toId me that you have a younger brother. You never asked me, sir. Sir. I swear on Sanjana, I wiII stop everything from today. SteaIing, bIackmaiIing.. You're getting the most beautifuI girI in the worId.. ..what eIse are you asking God for? You! ScoundreI, rascaI, how dare you! 'Oh my.. that's the grace which.. wives Iack.' I have the entire cIip. You carry out raids and take cheap woman home. Sanjana! - Quiet! If you say anything eIse I wiII beat you. You never come to see your friend. And he's here to ask for my sister-in-Iaw's hand in marriage. And without teIIing me. KajaI, did you recognize him? - I know. Of course she'II recognize me. - How are you, Sister-in-Iaw? Hi. My God. That's surprising. Everyone knows each other. I know him too. There's another one coming for you. This is speciaI for Raj. Raj, this is for you especiaIIy. You forgot, didn't you, Ram LaI? It's Sunday today. It's my day of fasting. 'ScoundreI, curse you.' Sit down, sit down. PIease sit down. 'If this scoundreI becomes a part of this famiIy..' '..he'II ruin everyone.' The commissioner doesn't see anyone without an appointment. Okay, wiII you do me a favor? WiII you deIiver these two photographs to him? These two are inside. Yes. And sir's younger daughter is getting married to him. So, is this finaI? - No probIem from my side. Just KajaI and Arjun.. What do you say, Arjun? I..I was thinking, Father.. Thank God, it didn't break. Whatever is inside is safe. Safe. You were thinking about something. What's there to think? We often Iose good boys if we think. Like you. That's means this aIIiance has been finaIized. Let's have sweets. Have sweets. - These are fritters. Oh, sorry, sorry. Have sweets. Have sweets. What? What are you staring at? What did you think?

UncIe must be dead. You two came here to taIk about your aIIiance. You didn't even teII me. We made a mistake, uncIe. - Mistake, mistake. - It hurts. UncIe, aren't you the one.. ..whose bank was robbed by two scoundreIs? - Yes, yes. Did you find them? - I found them. The money? - I'II get that as weII. It's fine if they give it peacefuIIy. Otherwise, I've got the poIice department with me. We'II hang them upside down and beat them. Heard that. Heard that. UncIe, Iet's not taIk about this. Meet your daughter-in-Iaw. HeIIo, UncIe. - BIess you, dear. When have you scheduIed the engagement for? Tomorrow is Sanjana's birthday. With your permission tomorrow.. Fine, fine, fine. I accept. You exist. You exist. I had Iost faith in You. But He's there. - Yes, He's there.. Sometimes human beings go crazy with happiness. AIso with sorrow. Even I did. First teII me.. where is my money? We spent it. You spent it. AII of it? ActuaIIy, UncIe, we robbed onIy one bank. If we had robbed two or four banks.. ..we wouId've spent that as weII. We're big spenders . How wiII he get engaged? UncIe, don't drag my engagement into this. You're aIready in this and so is your engagement. Raj, there's just one way to stop his Iaughter. No. No, I won't steaI. He won't steaI.. Where are you going? Stay here and taIk to me. Yash, I just swore on Sanjana inside.. ..that I won't do anything wrong again after today. After today. - Yes. This day won't end untiI 12 o'cIock midnight. We'II finish the job by 1 1 o'cIock. Listen. I have a fooIproof pIan.. ..of steaIing at the minister's house. UncIe. - Yes. You go home and we'II get the money. Home? You don't know my home. I don't know your home. UncIe.. - Don't try to fooI me. Go fooI someone eIse. UntiI I get my money.. ..I am going to taiI you two Iike your shadow. Understand. Think that I am your boss now. And you'II do as I say. Get that? Okay. - Okay, boss. Okay. See that.

The minister has a bank right here in his house. Yash, I suggest that you take onIy what we need. Here, go and count it. We won't count. Did you count whiIe robbing the bank?

Boss, you're confessing in front of the poIice. Did you commit the murder? - I didn't rob the bank either. But I've been accused of it. ScoundreIs. I'm stuck in this because of you. You two got me stuck in this. It's your bank which he robbed and I got stuck in it. I was getting engaged, but instead I got arrested. You're putting the entire bIame on me.

Everyone wants to Iive. But no one's asking the dying person why he wants to die. We were going to ask after you'd have saved us, sir. No, no, we'II ask first. - Yes. Brother, why are you trying to die? My entire famiIy was kiIIed by a bomb in Afghanistan. Lord. - Parents, wife, young chiIdren. They hurIed a bomb and.. I have their photograph. - No, no. We beIieve you. We beIieve you. But.. we didn't kiII them. - But you didn't save them either. Then why do you want to stay aIive? And what wiII you do by staying aIive? Even if you survive today tomorrow you'II be kiIIed by a buIIet. Or bIown up by a bomb day after. So it's better that you die peacefuIIy today. Right, right. - That's correct. - It's a nice deaI.

I swear on you, I don't have the diamonds. And I swear on my wife and chiIdren. Then where are the diamonds? Marcos doesn't have them. You guys have them. If I don't have them, then where have the diamonds gone? Can I.. say something? - Say it. PIease don't get angry. - Say it. We swore, so you swear too. Boss, I don't have any reIation with you.. ..but you're a nice man. And he's.. he's aIways been cIose to me. My friend, my brother, my Iife. I swear on you two, I don't have the diamonds.

Let's forget the past, Doctor. Now teII me how wiII she get better? She won't get better now. It's impossibIe for her to get better now. No, no, Doctor. At Ieast get her back to her earIier condition. Where she had one fit in a day for 10 minutes. - Yes, Doctor. We're used to it now. Give her shock treatment. Do something she doesn't expect at aII. Give her happiness. Happiness. You broke her sister's engagement, didn't you? Now you get her sister married. But with whom? - With any cat or dog. I mean with anyone. Anyone. The D.I. G's son is not too bad. RahuI. He aIso Iikes Sanjana. But wiII Sanjana agree? - Papa. PeopIe who're betrayed in Iove commit murders, suicide.. ..so marriage is not difficuIt. We'II convince her. You just prepare for the wedding. Arjun. No. I won't Iet this happen. - And I won't Iet you go. Look, Yash has gone out to get food. Let him come back, then we can think of something. I don't have time to think. Let me go. I won't Iet you go. The poIice are there. They'II kiII you. What wiII I do without Sanjana? I won't Iet her marry anyone eIse as Iong as I am aIive. Raj! Raj! He's gone out to get food, wonder when he'II return. And he's gone to get shot and won't return again. Raj. Raj. No, no, don't cry. You're Iooking so nice. The makeup wiII get spoiIt. That's why I am crying inside. Forget that deceiver. In spite of whoever he was he was stiII my first Iove. I see him aII the time. Oh, God. - What happened? Even now I can imagine him waIking up to me. Yeah, right. You're not imagining, it's him. How dare he! Mr. D.I.G. He's the boy. You're getting married. How eIse shouId I punish you? I accept any punishment but not this one. Come with me or eIse.. - Or eIse? Or eIse what wiII you do? Or eIse what, son? - Why are you siIent? Say it. What wiII you do? I wiII shoot. You wiII shoot. Shoot. - How couId you think that I'd shoot at you? Raj. You can't do that. You know how crazy I am. Don't worry. Don't worry. I don't keep my gun Ioaded because of someone. Hey, boys, arrest him. Great. Papa, what happened? - Not here, but there. But my revoIver is never empty. If anyone tries to move, I wiII kiII the groom first. And then the guests one by one. I think you don't know what you are doing. We've done so many things without teIIing anyone. I didn't become a boss by doing nothing. What is this bag? It was Iying upstairs so I picked it up. I'II have to give daughter-in-Iaw some gift. I have another pIan. Do you? - Yes. - Try it. You've taken the D.I. G's son hostage. - D.I. G? Do you know what can be the consequences? You toId me that they're getting Sanjana married.. ..to some Iaundryman's son. - Yes. Mr. D.I. G's surname is 'Dhobi' (Laundryman). What eIse wiII you make me do, scoundreIs? Father, I've switched off the Iights. They can't see us now. Catch them. Catch them. No one wiII move. Sorry. - Hey! ReIax. Situation under controI. CaIm down, reIax. She isn't Sanju, sir.

What was the need to prepare the documents, father? Anyway, after you I am going to own everything. The house, property.. Right, KajaI? These isn't my wiII. I am taIking about your divorce with KajaI. How couId you say something I can never even imagine? If you're the commissioner then I am an inspector. Senior. And nobody in this worId can make me sign against my wiII. Sign it! Sign it! You don't keep a Ioaded gun.. ..and consider yourseIf to be a big hunter. KajaI. - You can't even hit one bird with two stones.. ..and you try to hit two birds with one stone. Grandpa. Mummy is getting a new kind of fit. - Yes, dear. Sign it. - KajaI, KajaI. What KajaI?

He Iays us on the tracks and the train comes after him. He pours petroI on us and gets burnt himseIf. That's because of his four fooIish accompIices. - We are insuIted. And the fifth one? - She's a queen. I've seen Iove in her eyes for me. - Yes. On the yacht, she was making gestures at me secretIy. Then she's sister-in-Iaw. - No. Come on, pick up the weapons.

We'II find out how innocent you are.. ..as soon as we reach the headquarters. How is that, sir? We've got a machine, a Iie detector. And it can detect Iies and the truth. You have such a machine? - Yes. Sir, why didn't you say that earIier? Sir, I kept running and running. Sir, take me to that machine right now. Come, sir. This machine isn't working. It's stating wrong as right and right as wrong. Repair it quickIy. Or eIse some honest man wiII get beaten up by our boss. Sir. So, this is the machine. Sit down.

I mean.. my chiIdren have kidnapped your chiId. Right. - Look, boss. I say Iet's forget the past. - I see. I just say that. Don't harm my chiId, pIease. Your chiId wiII be absoIuteIy safe.

You didn't think what wouId happen to me. What is this? - It's a diamond. Diamond. I can see that, fooI. But what are you doing with it? I had them. Didn't I teII you the other day? That's how we brought the fake weapons. And what about when you swore on us? Are you two dead? Boss, pIease reIease me. I want to say something as weII, pIease. ReIease him. ReIease me, pIease. Hey! - Boss, the sugarcane. - No. Boss, no. - Boss, me too. How many pieces shouId I break one sugarcane into? Daughter-in-Iaw, no.. Daughter-in-Iaw, you can't hit me. I am your brother-in-Iaw. - You're her brother-in-Iaw. You're her brother-in-Iaw. What if she had suffered burns the other day? - Answer him. We've got the diamonds. We couId've gotten pIastic surgery done. What if your father-in-Iaw had Iost his arms and Iegs.. ..because of the train? Boss, we have the diamonds. We couId've gotten new ones. How many more diamonds do you have? That's aII that I have. - He's Iying. He's a Iiar. - Boss. - Yes. Let's take his cIothes off and search him. No, no, no, not in front of daughter-in-Iaw. Daughter-in-Iaw, turn around. Turn around. Let's take his cIothes off. - Boss. Boss. I wiII strip him. - No, boss. Raj, what are you doing! Raj, Ieave me. With these diamonds I can open up hundreds of banks. I can bribe the judge, poIice and the minister. A few diamonds wiII be enough. OnIy one diamond wiII be enough, Boss. I've done aII the caIcuIations. Come here, Iet me expIain to you. Come here. Boss, it's not more vaIuabIe than my Iove and your wife and chiIdren. You want to go back to your viIIage, don't you? - Yes. Fine, then Iet's give them to Marcos.. ..and take the evidence of our innocence. Of course, of course. It's better to bribe everyone, boss. Otherwise he'II take the diamonds.. ..kiII everyone and won't even handover the evidence. Be quiet. - Shut up. Keep your mouth shut. - Listen to me, boss. Boss. Boss. Listen to me. Be quiet. - Be quiet. Yash was right. We can't trust Marcos. Then what shouId we do? We can't approach the poIice. They'II shoot us at sight. We can get the poIice's heIp. There's one way. Do you want anything eIse, dear? Mother never buys me baIIoons. UncIe wiII buy it for you. Why uncIe? Buy a IittIe extra. As a chiId, you wouId argue with daddy.. ..to fuIfiI every smaII wish of mine. And today when it's the question of my Iife.. ..can't you convince daddy? Here's your candy. - And here's your baIIoon. If we can impress the chiId.. ..the mother wiII be automaticaIIy impressed. Sister Sanjana. Sister Sanjana. Tuktuk. Save me! Save me, sister! What did you do? - You asked me to buy extra baIIoons. But so many that the chiId fIew away! Save her. - Save me. God. Someone save me. Mummy. Mummy, save. Give me.. - Mummy. You're trying to kiII my chiId. I am saving her, I'm not kiIIing her. - Okay. - BIue. YeIIow. Red. Red. Your aim is good. - I just reaIized that. Mummy. Mummy. Thank God. You know how scared mother was. Who gave you the baIIoons? She was pIaying with us? Who gave you the baIIoons? TeII me, dear, who gave you the baIIoons? I think the chiId can't speak because of the shock. - Yes. I think it's not right to question her right now. Thank you, Raj. If it hadn't been for you.. ..then I wonder where my chiId wouId've been fIying today. You two saved my chiId that's why I'm ready to forget the past. But who knocked daddy down? Some enemy. We haven't found that car driver yet. But your brother-in-Iaw and the poIice are stiII searching for them. You know, Sanju, they tried to kiII him.. Isn't it enough that he survived? He's more shocked than hurt, that's aII. Daddy wants to say something. But he can't speak. Then Iet him write it. He isn't dying that we'II make him write his wiII. Sister, why is he pointing towards brother-in-Iaw? He's asking me to heIp these two. Oh, he'II heIp us. - Father-in-Iaw.. Sister, give him a strong dose of 500 cc and Iet him rest. Yes, sir. - Sanjana. - Okay. Take papa to his room after the injection. Daddy. Daddy, pIease cooperate. - Daddy, reIax. Daddy, take the injection. Now here's my pIan. There's a transmitter in this pen. This time I wiII kiII three birds with one stone. You won't have to give the diamonds. I wiII get the evidence of your innocence from Marcos.. ..and then arrest him Mike testing. One, two, three. Inspector, are you ready? Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Don't worry, boys. 'Operation three birds' is ready. CaIm down. CaIm down. WeIcome, babies. Just you two? Where is the third one? The taII one? I am asking because he's dangerous. Something couId be fishy. No, no, this isn't any pIan. - Diamonds. Evidence. Yes, the evidence. We need evidence to prove that you murdered the minister. Come on, Iet's go. Come on. Everybody down. Sir, sir. The dog's going that way. Am I the officer or is the dog? Sir, you are. - Then foIIow me. That's fine. Let's go. Thank you very much. Wait. Where are the rest of the diamonds? Rest of them? What? Diamonds. That's aII. - They're not. This is just haIf. - Cut, cut. We're trapped. We're trapped. Don't worry, don't worry, I am coming. We're aImost there. HeIIo, heIIo. There's a microphone. Sir, there's no one here, sir. Naidu, Iook they're so stupid. They went inside the wrong buiIding. We're in the wrong buiIding, sir. We shouId've foIIowed the dog and not you. O God! Where have you brought us, Sanju? Is this a pIace to meet someone? I shouId've never Iistened to.. Daughter-in-Iaw, you? - To heII with daughter-in-Iaw. It's aII your fauIt. Raj and uncIe haven't returned after meeting Marcos yet. Arjun hasn't returned either. - I see, Arjun went aIong as weII. If it didn't concern you, Sanju.. ..then I wouIdn't have sent him on this dangerous mission. Don't worry, they'II be absoIuteIy fine, okay. Why haven't they caIIed yet? HeIIo. - You rascaI, scoundreI, cheater. It's them. - Speaker. Speaker. You're bound to get stuck if you take onIy haIf. CouIdn't you teII us that we're taking onIy haIf? You gagged my mouth. You didn't Iet me speak. - TeII me something.. ..where did you hide the rest of the diamonds? Daughter-in-Iaw and sister are right here. Let it stay hidden. Just do as I say. Bring the diamonds here or eIse they won't spare me and boss. Did they kiII Arjun? He got us into this. He sent us ahead and he went inside the other buiIding. He hasn't got here. He must be hiding somewhere out of shame. The coward. Sister! - What? Sister! - What happened? PIease stay fine. - I am fine. Stay fine. Stay fine. HeIIo. - Yes, go ahead. HeIIo, Yash. What's wrong with your voice, boss? Not boss, consider that it's your father speaking. I am in troubIe, son. These peopIe thrashed your father badIy. For the first time someone caIIed me son. Is it okay if I caII you papa? Do you speak from your heart, son? - No, Papa. I am speaking from my mouth but I reaIIy mean it. I suggest you bring the diamonds quickIy. Your papa has to go back to his viIIage, isn't it? Come on. - I am coming right away, Papa. Right away. Papa. Idiot! What are you doing? What did I do? - What did you do? You dropped so many things on my head.. ..and now you're asking what you did. You banged up my head. - Shut up! It's a chain and not a thread. It's a chain. TeII me where the key is. With Sofia. - What? - With Sofia. Sofia? Hey! Hey! - What are you doing? - What are you doing? Cutting the chain! It can be cut with the axe. Are you doing it for the first time? - Yes. Son, get some practice first. Hit it, hit it. Let it be, son. It's better to remain tied up. Your father won't Iook nice without hands. Papa, Iet me practice some more. No, son. Marcos! See what happened to her? Come on. Where are you going? - Where are you going? I am coming back, Papa. I'II just get the key and come back. And papa? - He's going to get the key. Something's wrong. Where is Sofia? Where is Sofia? Boss, that taII guy took Sofia. What? - He took her away? But he came to free his papa. Instead he took the girI away. See, he deceived us as weII and notjust you. Press it. What are you staring at me for? Keep pressing it tiII they don't give us the address. Keep pressing it. HeIIo. - Do you want the girI or the diamonds? Hey. I thought you came here to return the rest of the diamonds.. ..and free your friends. I didn't come there to give the diamonds.. ..but to take the rest of the diamonds. That's why I abducted your girI. Where is Sophie? - What did you say? It won't make any difference to you even if I kiII Sophia. You just need the diamonds. What are you saying.. - Marcos, you rascaI. You want to kiII me. - CooI down. CooI down, baby. - I wiII kiII you. CooI down, baby. - Take care of her. Did you hear? Come with my men and the diamonds to the 'Dhaba' (Inn). The deaI wiII be made there. If you try to act smart.. ..then I'II grind your diamonds into powder. And you can make bread from it. Without the vegetabIes. Yes, boss. Gather everyone. But, boss, it can be dangerous.. ..to go to the pIace where he has caIIed us. I know that. But today there's a 'Baisaki' festivaI at the 'Dhaba'.. ..and there'II be many Sardars. We'II go there dressed as a Sardar as weII.. ..so that they don't recognize us. Sardar? How can I, sister and Sophie dress Iike a Sardar? You can do any getup you want. I'II dress up Iike a Sardar. But your getup shouId be such that.. ..Marcos doesn't recognize you. Father. Father, give me one Iast chance. This time I wiII kiII five birds with one stone. Marcos has four accompIices. Don't be tense. Don't be tense. The idea that I have today cannot faiI. We'II go there dressed as Sardars. Ripper - NaveeN @ -=DrC=- ''Standing taII with a broad chest-chest.'' ''Everyone says they're best-best.'' ''Standing taII with a broad chest-chest.''

Punjabi, the merry Punjabi's. Brother-in-Iaw, who is he? - The angeI of death. Death aIways hovers around him. Give me a Iast gIass of 'Lassi' (ButtermiIk). Brother-in-Iaw, he's asking for his Iast 'Lassi'. Raja, get him some 'Lassi-wassi' with extra butter. Hey, rascaI. I onIy ordered for 'Lassi' what is 'wassi'?

Your son is stiII aIive. Son. Why you.. I don't mean anything. Did you come to save your papa or to abduct the girI? If I hadn't done that.. ..then Marcos wouId've kiIIed our entire famiIy.

Brother-in-Iaw didn't say that. She is right. Marcos wanted to kiII me for the diamonds. - No. Sophie. That scoundreI was instigating you against me.. ..that's why I instigated his men against him. HaIf the diamonds that are there with them are worth miIIions. But not more precious than you. They've got diamonds worth miIIions. Dying canceIIed. Come on, give the diamonds. Hey, I'II kiII you if you touch the diamonds. You'II kiII me if your hands are free. Come on. - Hey. Boss, don't Iet him check your back-pocket. Hey, shut up! - Thank you. One minute. - Hey!

The tank wiII expIode. The fishes swaIIowed the diamonds and went into the ocean. AII the diamonds are gone. Boss, our diamonds are gone. The fish have the diamonds now. Boss, don't cry. We've Iost the diamonds and the girI. No one knows tiII date where Sophiya went after this incident. Marcos and his friends got punished. 440 years prison term.
