Wise think that little girl that one day she would marry a .... Beautiful ... And strong Doctor. She knew. You were always part of the plan. What is that? It is the curfew. When you were in the bathroom said Phil that the village has a curfew. Everyone in their homes at 8. Are you kidding? That is too much. I like. Family first. Remember? Family first. Want help with this? No, that can wait. Let's relax. Thank you. For our new house. What? Nothing. You're still thinking this afternoon. I tell you, I think he wanted I got into that room. If he wanted you to see his wife, I'm sure he'd asked. Probably you heard the wrong door No. He definitely said, go left. Maybe the other bathroom was broken. He said he had cancer. I know. Terrible.

No Daddy, you have to stay lines. What? Sorry. That's better? Enough What are those? Honey? Papi ... Do ghosts exist? Why are you asking about ghosts? Scooby-Doo movies. There are no ghosts. But I see in my room at night. The lights frighten me. Nothing will happen to you ... While I'm here. You promise? - I promise. Hello Michael! Hello, Phil. Good morning. I have not seen much since you moved. Yes, yes. Everything has been very crazy and full of patients. Are you going for a walk? Yes, I thought ... Check the trails. They can be a bit dangerous if you do not know. I can help you if you want. Yes. Let - I guess if ... All right. This way. Are we going to a specific place? Oh, just a little place that I know. It's not too far. This is incredible. I thought you'd like. What is this place? Just a piece of land time forgot. Native American? Not exactly. Years ago ... Actually ... centuries There was a race of wild men that populated this area. They were not Indians. Were people living in isolation. And all who trod this earth will be victims of the savagery of "isolated". That's what the natives They called "isolated". Lady Zellis ... That brought me here when I move to Ashborough. The meet. She can tell the story better than me, but ... "Isolated" grew in numbers and they learned to hunt. And people decided to make sacrifices to keep their families safe. ?"Sacrifice"? Yes. You know ... Rabbits, squirrels, deer ... Any animal. These are bloodstains. And they are not of a century ago. I know. Are you saying that people still they make sacrifices? Yes. When I came here first ... Zellis Lady stressed the importance of the traditions of the people. I'm doing the same with you. Am I saying that you have to find a dead animal ... and put it on a slab in the the woods? I meant that shopped a living animal, you put it on the slab and kill him. All we have done is tradition. You can not be serious. After today, you can not tell nothing about this to anyone. Phil, it's just folklore. No, it is not folklore, is legend. What is the difference? Well, legends never disappear. How long do we have to be here? Do not be melodramatic. They are our neighbors and your patients. I know. I just do not think it will be happy to see me here. Honey, that's ridiculous. Just look, I do not fit the demographic. Just give them a chance so they get used to you. Provided they do not find me a 'Cave "winner Bible. What is a "troglodyte"? You see what you did. Yes, I am expanding your vocabulary. Michael. I'm glad you could bring your family. Of course, of course. This is my wife Rosy. And we do not really ... - It's a Nice to meet you finally, Dr. Cayle. And you must be Christine. And Jessica. Mommy, what's wrong with your face? - Jess ... Sorry Mrs. Deighton. Please do not have to apologize. Let Jessica. Let us know your new classmates, okay? Sorry. Let me introduce you to all doctor. Thanks Rosy. I was hoping you could end the previous conversation. I think I already did pretty Phil clear on that. Hello Doc., Sam Harper. - Hi. And my wife Joanna. Welcome to Ashborough, Doctor Cayle. - Hi. Listen, I have this back pain ... You know, if you call the office and make a appointment would be happy to check it out. Andy Godbout. I know this rash that keeps popping up. My son A.J. Do not be rude A.J. Dr. shake hands. Nice to meet Doc. - Nice to meet you. A.J. enters fourth year As this school year Tyler. That's great, great. Are you thinking about going to college after graduation? My son does not have to go. Not when you can follow the footsteps of his father. Right. Sorry. That's Lady Zellis. Who is she? She leads the women's club in the church, but ... His family founded Ashborough why She thinks she owns the people. You do not trust her, right? Why do you ask me that? Okay, you should not ... - Hello Tyler. What do you A.J.? Can we talk for a second? - I was talking to Dr. Cayle. This certainly would not mind, Doctor right? No, it is not, either. What do you think you're doing? Christine! Christine! She's not here, doctor Cayle. Miss Hunter. I was looking for my wife. It's just you and me. Alone. So I think it should look outside. What's the rush? What are you doing? Only what I have to do. I have to go. Cayle Doctor, please ... You do not understand. Release my arm. You can help me, protect me. What? ?Protect Yourself? What are you talking about? What is your problem? Nothing. No problem. All right. Good afternoon, Miss Hunter. Hey ... Where have you been? It was ... Never mind. Can we go home? Hey ... What? I just found out ... her daughter died. - Who? Lady Zellis. It's not important, just let us go. Jesus, Michael. Where were you? In the bathroom. I thought I heard someone down. I do not know ... Just lie down. Are you sleeping? Yes, for now. I'm worried. He who is afraid of sleep in his room. I'm sure it's just a phase. I think he's starting to get stressed or something. It not stressed affection, only 8 years. Do not talk to the teacher and she said Children are beginning to lead away ... Michael ... - What? I am pregnant. Christine ... That's fantastic! I thought you were not ready yet. What are you talking about ?, why It was that we moved here, right? Then you went to see the "OB" or still ... I actually started seeing the village midwife. Why? It's what all women here they do. Who is the midwife? Lady Zellis. What? Come on, you can not see .... - Please Michael is my decision. I do not want to discuss this, It's okay? All right. Jessica wants you to help with homework. Okay, only I have to finish this. You know? I thought that one of the reasons why It was that we moved here for ... had more time for your family. Chris, we can not ... Sorry. I know you're busy. ?Lauren? You can help me. You can protect me. Please Cayle Doctor! The church needs volunteers to clean so ... I'll be all day in the village. You've been spending a lot of time in that church lately. Michael ... I thought you were gonna help me in the office. Next week, I promise. I already made this commitment. Listen ... Do you hear something in the yard last night? Like what? Nothing, just thought I had heard something. Probably some kind of animal. That's our car. Let Jess. Honey, do not forget your backpack.

Where is your body now? I do not know. I told him that disappeared when I went outside. Well, are you sure she she was dead? Of course yes! You of all people should know that dead do not rise and they will walk, Doctor. Look, you gonna help me or not? Listen ... I suppose I could go home Lauren to see if she's there. She will not be there. Do you know what ?, I'll go away to see if someone can help me. Calm down and I'm sure We solve this! What the hell am I doing? Need help Doc.? I imagine that you are a mechanic. The only one in town. The car is dead. Would you mind check? Well I can tow ... And if you want to take it to the workshop. I'll check when there. No, I have a hurry. Could you check it now? If he's dead ... there's nothing I can do here. Is something Doc.? You decide. All right. I take it away. Michael, thank God you're here! What's going on?
