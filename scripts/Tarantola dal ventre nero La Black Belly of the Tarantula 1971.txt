Listen.|I don't really want to talk to you. And right now it's not possible. I told you, I can't right now. Why don't you come|by my house tonight? Ok then. Just don't start any fights. Will you stop that? You're so hateful. I knew you would start it again. I'm hateful you say? You are a dirty slut. That is all that you are. Why did you send me this picture? To piss me off? No, it was not me. I had nothing to do with it. It wasn't me! I'm not going to let you ruin|my life, work or my reputation. What does this have to|do with your work? What do you want from me? The truth is you're jealous. You probably had|those pictures taken. I think this is a stupid trick.|I'll bet on it. It's a stupid scam. I want to know who he is. Give it to me. Filthy pig. What are you going to do now? Just leave me alone. That's enough now. Come in. Enough. Quite. Who's there? The bedroom is rectangular|twenty nine by sixteen. A window on the eastern side,|three feet from the wall. ..with no traces of blood... On the wall right by|the library, some marks. On the left side, on a small|glass table some blood. The bedroom is where|the body was violated. Anyone you would suspect? What? Oh, excuse me.|No, no suspects. Have you two been|separated for long? Four months. How was your relationship? Fine. Can I have one? What? A cigarette. After you finish that, check|the house inside and out. Listen, from top to bottom.|Turn it upside down. Take photos of everything. Got it? Why did you come to see her? I had my reasons. Detective, we found this. Look under the dresser. Check under that one too. Did you know you wife was|having affairs with other men? Do you get jealous? That is none of your business. I see. What do you do? Sell insurance. Did your wife have life insurance? What are you trying to say? Nothing, nothing. For the moment, nothing. When was the last|time you saw you wife? About ten days ago. Where were you yesterday? At a friends place. What is his name? Gianfranco Carlini.|Marolini street number five. Ok, we will check it out. For now, stay available. Sure. Oh, my god! Who can I talk to? The commissioner. This is all my fault. I can never forgive myself. So you killed her? Are you joking? It's my fault because|she called me last night. She was so upset. Don't photograph me.|I don't want to be in the papers. And I didn't do my hair. Don't worry.|We're not going to take your picture. Let's understand each other. I don't want to be|involved in this investigation. Unless it's really necessary. Why was she upset? Because she had an|argument with her husband. Where? Right here in the house. I should have come over last night. If I would have come|over I would have killed her. You promised you would not be late. Oh, well. Look. Six hundred. I sold everything. Isn't that what you wanted? What? The furniture. Now we can remodel. We wanted to do that right? Yes, that's right. Did I get tricked? If I did, I can give this back. I'm going to.|I got tricked... I've changed my mind. I don't want to do it at all. It's wondertul. Out with the old, right? Are you tired? I'll get dinner ready. Eggs tonight? Nope, chicken. Oh, chicken. If it's not eggs, it's chicken. So...|how did things go today? Fine. Come on. Tell me.|What happened? We found a nude girl dead. Poor girl. These are the|fingerprints of the victim. They were everywhere,|including on the water glass. Here we have the prints|of an unidentified women. And the prints we found|in the guest room of the house... -They belong to the husband?|-Yes. First, lets see if he purchased|life insurance for his wife. Very well detective. No, that is not the husbands hand. And, what is that? I can't tell.|Perhaps if the photo was enlarged. I can find him in two days. I just need to get started. That's why they call me "speedy''. Pardon? Speedy.. Now that l'm on the job,|l'll be working at this case... ...non stop. Look, l'll call|you the day after tomorrow. The phone is broken. If your phone doesn't|work how do I contact you? I use the phone at the bar. By the way... ...write down the number. Who will answer? Whoever picks up will answer Just ask for Speedy. And l'll get the phone.|It's easy as that. Hurry up. Report the cocaine to narcotics. Very well detective. I'm almost done. Check everywhere.|Especially around the victim. We'll probably|find more drugs there. Move, move.|Come on. Let me through. Ok, this is the complete report. Forensics report and the scientific|report from the Narcotics squad. Trafficking drugs? Yes, large quantities of cocaine. Well, looking at this... ...first she was by herself. Second, the drugs aren't superticial. Third, the girls were both|killed the same way. And forth, the girls|have nothing else in common. But our investigation|may prove otherwise. I agree. Regarding the women at the store,|we must identify all her suppliers. We can check her address book. It seems she was a middle-man. Oh, that reminds me.|What about the pin in her neck? Oh yes. We have figured that out. Look. It's an acupuncture needle. The killer used to paralyze her The victim remains|completely aware but frozen. Aware of the killer,|but unable to resist. I see then these cases are similar. Should I take it, or you? No, you can have it. It was yours first.|Go ahead it's all yours. Freeze. Put your gun on the dash. You are making another mistake. I came to ask you for help. I am innocent. Why don't you turn yourself in? I don't trust you. You'll lock me away. This way I can find the killer I am not joking. Killing a cop will cost you This is how you ask for help? I came to get help from you. Now don't move. Why should I believe you? Don't move. Why should I believe you? For the same reason I am here. I could have phoned you. Without any risk. The tarantula is a terrible creature. It has only one|enemy who can kill it. The deadly and very|poisonous black wasp. You can see,|the wasp always attacks first. In a fight between them,|the wasp always wins. The tarantula has no escape. Watch closely. See. The wasp has won. The tarantula is paralyzed|from the needle of the wasp. The needle enters|the skin and injects... ...a poison venom. The tarantula is paralyzed|and the wasp devours it. The spider is helpless against|the wasp and can do nothing. It can only watch as it is eaten alive. I see. I wanted you to see this so you can|understand the killer in your case. Thank you professor. It's been very interesting. But you haven't told me about|your relationship with the lady. A simple acquaintance. That's all. So commissioner.|If you don't mind... I need to get back to work. Where do they come from? The Orient. Careful, they are very dangerous. Don't worry. It's a flimsy case. But who would think of|putting their hand inside? Why would anyone want to do that? Because this isn't sand. Open the box and|take out the spider. Commissioner, I ... Don't waste my time. Take this to Narcotics. There's much more inside. Want coffie? No! I just finished painting it. Did you get some on yourself? What is all this? This is going to be the couch. Just for now. Not very comfortable. It has no cushions. Don't worry.|It will be beautiful. I tried it at the store|and it came out just great. You'll see. Ok, but what did|you buy with the six hundred? I bought the bed, a lamp|and those two pieces over there. Is there any chance|for a table to eat on? Yes, someone is giving us one. Who? The manager at the store. I'm doing a window display. And he's paying me with a table. I don't like that guy so much. What are you doing? I'm going back to bed. It's Sunday.|A fine day to lay in bed. Do you want any coffee? Fine. Come on. Go. Take a walk. Here is your coffee. You know, l'd be a great maid. The photos. Wait before you send them. Wait? For what? Do what I tell you.. I'm coming over now. I can't hear you. It's a jet landing. Finally we solved the mystery. By analyzing the|angle of the decent... ...can we determine|the location of the apartment? We can try.|I would think so. There, there! Where? That way. They jumped over the gate. Hurry commissioner. Commissioner. Zani, I found him. Commissioner,|do you guys remember me? Speedy! This is squad two. The detective is|chasing two suspects. Over. Freeze Zani! Have this developed immediately. Commissioner, the red car|that killed the young man, was apparently his. Very well. The rest is routine. I'm done here. See you tomorrow. Sir, the bill. Mrs. Valentino. I'm commissioner Tellni. Open up. Open it. I know you're home. What do you want from me? I gave you everything I had. Go. Please go. Calm down Mrs. Here. I'm commissioner Tellni.|Homicide. I don't know. I don't understand this. Just please go. Fine. I can't force you. Anyway. Take this. What is it? It's your money. Please Mrs. Let me come in. I need to talk to you. I know you're being|blackmailed for certain photographs... ...taken while you where|in the company of a young man. That young man was killed|and now you're in danger. As you see I had to|play the role of the blackmailer I did it to make you confess. Otherwise you would have denied it. Mrs, you are my|only lead in this case. You must tell me everything. No, I can't. I can't. Too many things. But you have to tell me. Just have courage. I promise,|there won't be any scandal. You have my word. Yes, fine. I'll tell you everything. But not now. I am too tired... too tired. Excuse me, but I really can't. Tomorrow if you want. Come over tomorrow, any time. But for now, please leave. Go please. I beg you go.|Please just go. Please... This is the film found|in the victims house? Yes, captian. Should I stop it? No, wait. Maybe we'll figure something out. Seems like the|investigation is going deeper. What are you doing here? Spying on you. Come on. Really. Did something happen? I've decided to resign. But why? Because I can't do it anymore. That's why. I'm not cut out for it. Yesterday there was a woman... I couldn't even save her. And then, there's|something even worse. Our private life has been invaded. Understand? I don't want that. You shouldn't be at risk. Please explain. Yes, I always told you|to quit if you hated it. But now? You can't give up. No question, not now. Anyway,|think about what's going on. If he's humiliated you,|then the killer must also fear you. That means you are getting close. He's scared of you. I didn't ask for anything. Come on. Eat, Mrs. Blue. You know you want it. Fat is beautiful. Right? On the contrary. I don't care. I'm leaving right away. Don't get hysterical. You are hysterical. Can't you see we're in trouble.|Yes or no? -The police...|-Shut up! Stupid girl. Everything fine Mrs. Masari? Fine, she's asleep. He can't see. But he understands. Now tell me silly girl. What's wrong with you? Wrong? l'm Scared. Scared of everything. Even of you Laura. Everyone has ended up dead. Zani, Richi, Valentino and now Mario. Oh, no my dear.|Too easy. When you were|putting money in your pocket... You were singing a different tune. I'll tell you something. I've had enough. Enough of you especially. Things have gotten worse. I'm going to talk to the police. I'll tell them everything. I'm not worried. You have more to lose. Perhaps. But at lest l'll save my skin. Do what you want. But, here is some advice. Be careful. Very careful. What are you saying. Is that a threat? Take it however you want. I still haven't found a place to sleep. Just this evening,|then l'll figure something out. Thanks. Thanks, you're very kind. What is it? What do you want? Oh, really wondertul Mrs. A women with a|moustache is beautiful. I don't know what you think|but I don't think it's correct. They say Torino has ltaly's|second largest amount of prostitutes. Can you believe that? A business without taxes. Here you go. Chineto, a cigarette? Sorry. Have you seen Miss Laura? Miss unisex? I saw her in the|sauna a little while ago. A detective is here. You caught me just in time.|I was going to the police station. For what reason? To talk about Jenny. One of my employees. I look after the girls who work here. I think that Jenny|meant a bit more to you. Perhaps, but only in my private life. And your partner? What partner? The blackmailer He was blackmailing|some of your clients. Seems the ones|blackmailed are now dead. If you are accusing|me of blackmailing my clients, you better explain why|I would want to kill them. I didn't say you killed them. I am only investigating. To start with; I need to|question all of your employees. But there are clients here.|Please inspector. Send them to me one by one. I've been working|here for three years. Why have you decided|to quit Ms. Laura? I found a job with better hours. I prefer that. Even for less pay. Yes, of course. Come on in. May l? What is your job here? I am the waiter. And your name? Geno Parlotta.|But they call me Chineto. Married? No, thank God. Very well, thank you.|You can go. Take off your shades. Certainly Very well. Thanks, you can go. But... Excuse me, l'll help you. Beatrice. Commissioner. I think I know who is the killer But, in exchange... I want you to forget|certain things you may know. Mrs. If you know anything,|it would be better to tell me. Just give me until tomorrow night. At that time l'll have the proof. Detective! l've got the proof.|Come to the institute fast! Come now, don't wait. I'm scared. -What's going on?|-Nothing, nothing. Hello? If you're going to be long, call me. So I won't be worried. Come on in. You must wake up. Or it's just not exciting. You must experience|what is happening to your body. Stop! It isn't critical.|Your wife will be fine. The killer has confessed. Seems he is a|psychotic schizophrenic. He also has a suffers from|paranoia and is impotent. His wife would boss him around. Seems she had|affairs so he went mad... Pathologically, suddenly|he snapped and killed his wife. That happed five years|ago but was never discovered. He just confessed to it. Then he decided|to pretend to be blind. It made him feel|secure around women. He then had an|encounter with Mrs. Zani. She was the type of woman|who provoked and angered him. He felt intimidated by|her and with his paranoia, she reminded him of his wife so... ...he returned to murder.|First one, then another and another... Excuse me.You know, I can't take it... Let's talk later. You can relax now.|Everything is alright. She will be totally fine. Can l... Right now she needs rest. You should rest too. You look like you need some.
