President Roosevelt signs The Draft Bill... an epochal step in national defense. Impressive ceremonies... Secretary of War Stimson is blindfolded... draws the first number from 9,000 sealed capsules. Roosevelt: The first number drawn by the Secretary of War is serial number... Man: And the youth of America prepare to become peacetime buck privates. - That's no way to drive, Martin. - Sorry, sir. The line forms on the left. You play soldier. Everything seems to be running smoothly, Captain Johnson. Yes, sir, we're getting a fine group of men. - More teeth and less flat feet. - That's splendid. I'll see you later. - Captain Johnson. - Yes? I'm Randolph Parker. Dad's in Washington now heading some kind of defense board. - I suppose you've heard from him? - No. Oh, well I'm sure you will. Dad's bound to want me working with him. So, about this order to report for training... Why of course, Mr. Parker, I understand. If you'll just step in here, we'll be delighted to take care of you. Thanks. You're sure this won't take long? Oh no. You'll hang your hat there please. Yes. - And your coat, too. - My coat? And the rest of your clothes please. - Doctor: Tonsils okay. Open please. - The rest of my... - Wide. - 155, next. Tonsils okay. Next. - Wide please. - 175. Next. - Name? - I'm Robert Martin. Number 158. 158? Say, that's a nice number. Imagine me being first prize in a raffle. Give a boy a break, Officer. He's reporting for service. Man: That's the stuff. That's fine and dandy. I don't want to give you any sales talk, but in my time, I've advertised tooth powder face powder, foot powder and flea powder. I've lived on the bounty of the county and done my boardin' with the warden. Never have I ever had the opportunity of presenting such merchandise to the public. Feel that material. That's enough. Now, friends, ordinarily this tie would sell in any haberdashery for a dollar and a half. But am I asking you for a dollar and a half? No. Am I asking you for a dollar? No. Am I asking you for 50c? No. All I'm asking for is 10c. Now wait a minute. Let me get a word in... or two. Go on, go ahead. I'll listen to you for a while. Thanks kindly. Neighbor, how much money have you got? - I've got in the vicinity of $28. - You've got $28? In the vicinity. In the neighborhood I've got three bucks. - Then, you've got $3? - Roughly speaking. - Roughly speaking? - When you smooth it out I've got a buck. Then you have a dollar? You have a dollar. That's all I want to know. The gentleman buys 10 ties. How can he sell ties that cheap? We ain't got no overhead. We haven't even got a license to sell these ties. - Feel that material. - It won't wrinkle or fade. Fade, Smitty, fade... What's wrong? What's wrong? The "oper-cay" is here The "oper-cay"... Come here! Get in the cab. Hey, cabbie, step on it. We're trying to get away from a cop. - Cops: Oh yeah? - Ooh-ooh! Herbie! Quick, get in line. - We'll hide in the movies. - Yeah, and when we get in we'll stay a long time. - Get a couple tickets. - Okay. - Whoop. - What are you, a wise guy? You want to fight? Take your coat off. It's much cooler this way, ain't it? Go ahead, get a couple of tickets. What's your hurry? We got rid of that dumb cop. - How much to get in? - Nothing. We're going to give you $21. Oh, bank night. Giving any dishes away? - No, tin plates. - Tin plates, what a novelty. Now we can start our new set. - Step inside. - Come on or we won't get a seat. Hey, usher. Hey, you, what picture's playing in here? - You're in the army now. - Good, I never saw that picture. Calling Dr. Coldwater. What's this "Calling Dr. Coldwater?" - It must be a double feature. - Ah, yes. - Draftee? - Not a bit. - Do you feel it? - No. I feel very comfortable in here. Right over there. Let's register before the drawing starts. Think you're gonna win, huh? Step right up, boys. Sign right here, please. - "Please"? What polite ushers. - Quiet! And let me have your signature right there, please. I'd be delighted. And I hope I win. Congratulations, men. - We're glad to have you in the army. - Both: Thanks. What?! - Smitty: The army? - You won. Gangway! Mutiny! - Whoop-whoop! - Going someplace, boys? Yeah, yes, we're going someplace. We're going in the army and you can't touch us. Oh, so you're going in the army, eh? Well, I'll be seeing you. What am I laughing at? What are you putting your tie on for? Somebody might come in. 239. You just made it. If you'd been over 240, we'd have had to turn you down. Next. - Hey, Smitty, did you hear that? - Yes. - If you're over 240 Ibs. they don't take you. - That's right. Boy, am I lucky. Get a load of this. 241, hm-hmm! Oh, sit down before you get in trouble. Get away. 1- 6-4, 164. Next. 239, next. 158 and 1/2. Next. 173 and 1/4. Next. 164, next. Set still. You act as though you've got a hot foot. Hot foot? Brother, you've got a very poor sense of direction. 158 and 1/2. Next. Boy, this is arson. 164. Next. That's you, Herbie. Whew. Okay, Smitty, have a good time in the army. It's going to be okay. Congratulations, my boy. You're in the army by two ounces. Two ounces?! Double crosser! Just for that, you go to bed without your supper. ...and that I will obey the President of the United States... All: ... And I will obey the President of the United States... ...And the orders of the officers appointed over me according to the rules and articles of war. All: And the orders of the officers appointed over me according the the rules and articles of war. You men will report at the High Street Armory at 7:00. We will leave from the railway station at 9:00. Until then, dismissed. I'm gonna go home to my mama. Will you get my hat, Martin? I left it in the other room. - Mr. Parker. - Yes? I've worked for you for two years, haven't I? - Yeah, that's right. - Quite an experience. I've carried you upstairs and put you to bed any number of times. - Why bring that up? - I got you out of fights with nightclub waiters and gambling house bouncers. - So? - Remember that night I froze both my ears waiting for you? And that little accident you had where I took the rap and went to jail? Look, Martin, let's not reminisce. But we're in the army now and I think it's time I tendered my resignation. - Very well, tender it. - Yes, sir. - What do you think of that? - That gives me an idea. - Turn on the heat and get me in the army, will you? - So what? - Why... - No! Well, what are you waiting for? - Detail! - Detail! - Halt! - Halt! Let the men fall out until train time. Yes, sir. You men can fall out, but don't go out of this area. Say your goodbyes and when I say, "fall in," be here. Dismissed. All right, girls, you can go into action. Cigarettes, soldier? Compliments of the army. Everything all right here? Oh, you look lonesome. Won't you have an apple? Cigarettes, soldier? Judy Gray, what are you doing here? - I joined the army. - Go on. Um-hmm. I'm a camp hostess now. It's something new. We're going to try to give the boys the feeling that the camp is their home. - Add the feminine touch. - That'll make being drafted a lot more popular. I think it's pretty popular right now. - Your cigarettes, sir. - Thanks. See you later, Bob. Apples, compliments of the army. I'm sorry, sir, but your mother's in sight. - Go away. My mother?! - Yes, sir. Oh, that's all I need. Scram, you beautiful things. Come on, come on. What is this? She's coming this way, sir. Very good work, Edmonds. Fix your face, sir. Fix your face. Have an apple, boys? Cigarettes? Cigarettes? Mrs. Parker: Randolph, my boy. - Hello, Mother. - I phoned your father. - Yeah? - He'll have you out of this in no time. - Did he say exactly when? - Oh, a week at the most. I suppose you'll just have to make the best of the ordeal. Pardon my saying so, Mrs. Parker, but it won't be an ordeal. As a matter of fact, a year in the army can do a great deal for any man. Just heaps. Oh, I can understand how it may benefit some men... those who have no advantages in their homes. - I know, but... - But his education and background should certainly entitle him to more than these other young men. How can they make a Yale man a private? Would you care for some chewing gum? Yes, thanks. - Have you got a lollypop? - Um-hmm. You like lollypops? I'm a sucker for these things. Gee, she's a nice-looking messenger boy-girl. Oh, stop looking at her. I was only looking at her to see if she was looking at me to see if I was looking at her. Remember our vaudeville days? You remember those three little girls worked with us on the same bill? Oh, look over there. Oh, the Andrews Sisters. Oh, boy.

Oh, hello. Hello. Oh, you need a light, soldier? Yeah, thanks. I didn't catch your name. I didn't throw it. - Don't go away. - But I have to, I'm on duty. A hostess' first duty is to keep the soldiers happy. And I will not be happy unless we get better acquainted. We have a full year to become acquainted. Yeah, but I'll be out of the army in a week. What's the matter, Judy? Just a fresh recruit trying out the manual of arms. - Uh-huh. - Oh, Bob, please. It wasn't anything, really. Oh, Judy, we're running out of chewing gum. Do you have any to spare? Yes, Patty. I'm just telling you to stay away from her. I'll pick my own company, Martin. Maybe on Park Avenue, but not in the army. Keep away from Judy! Judy, eh? Private stock? - Why you... - Mmmm-mmmm. It's no good, huh? Excuse me. - You guys see my pal? - No, I haven't. You haven't seen him, huh? I always did prefer cinders to cigar smoke. Do you boys mind if we share this platform with you? - No, not at all. - Come right in. We'll finish our dance later? You've got a date. Come on and do your duty. Wham! There it is, boys. Seven is a natural. - Cleaned me. - Talk about hot dice. There goes my lesson for today. - What are you doing, boys? - He just gave us a lesson in dice. Dice? What's dice? It's a game. Don't you play games? Yeah, I play jacks. - He plays jacks. - I'm up to my foursies. Oh, behave. There's the game. Will you teach me how to play that? Will I teach you how to play it? I should say I will. Will I teach him? There's numbers on there from one to six. Now, you roll 'em out and if you should roll a one and a six, that's a seven, that's a natural, you win. Your roll a five and a two, that's seven, that's a natural, you win. You roll a four and a three, that's seven, that's a natural, you win. - That's all you do is win? - Well, no. - Oh, you can lose, too. - Well, not often. If you roll a one and a two, that's craps, you lose. If your roll two sixes, that's craps, you lose. You can win and you can lose. - That's it. - That's fair. See, seven you win and craps you lose. - Let's play. - You want to play? You roll the dice. - We play for money? - Yes. Now how much do you want to bet? - I'll bet $10. - That's a good bet. There you are. Now good luck to you. - Seven you win, craps you lose. - Here I go. - Go ahead. - Whee! Seven. I win. Wait, I forgot. Don't pick up the money right away. - I do get to pick it up. - Yeah, sure, it's your money. - Yeah. - Yes, yes, yes. You roll 'em again. How much you want to bet? - Fade that. - "Fade that"? Wait a minute. Just a minute. - Don't get so rough. - Wait a minute. - Where did you get that "fade that"? - Did I say something wrong? - No, you said it too darn right. - I'm sorry. You're sorry? You're sure you never played this game before? All right. There you are. Go ahead. - Same thing? - Same thing. - Here I go again. - Go ahead. Wheee. Seven again. I win. - Yes, you win again. I guess it's beginner's luck. - Yeah. What do you want to bet now? - Let it ride. - "Let it ride"? Wait a minute. - Just a minute. - Hmmm! Now, don't tell me you got that out of thin air! I heard it at the clubhouse. - That's what I thought. - I must confess. - Come on! - Well, there was a bunch of boys in the clubhouse and they had lumps of sugar and they was throwing them out. I heard the boys say that. - But you didn't play? - They wouldn't let me, I was too young. - Oh, that's different. - Starting Tuesday I'm going out with girls. I don't blame you. That's all right. - Go ahead. - Okay. I though you'd played the game. - Same thing? - Same thing. - Wheew! - There you are, four. - A little Joe. - "Little Joe"?! Now wait a minute! - Just a minute! - Clubhouse! Clubhouse! "Clubhouse," yes. You learned a lot at that clubhouse, didn't you? Four is your number. But don't forget, if you throw a seven before you make that four you lose. - Okay. - Go ahead. - I start? - You start. Uh-uh-uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh. - I'll be legitimate. - Yeah, you'd better be. Wham! - Clubhouse. - Um-hmm, clubhouse, eh? - Three, you lose. - How come? - What'd you roll the first time? - Four. - What did you just roll? - Three. - Four and three is what? - Seven. Oh, you add 'em up? He didn't say anything about adding them up. - Go down to the clubhouse and learn that. - That's not fair. - We play my way now. - I gotta use my money now? For a change, yes. You've used mine long enough. Put it all down. You don't care, do you? All right, watch 'em. Here they go. - Six - Six is the point. Well, boys, watch this one. Six again, you lose. - No, I win. - What'd you roll the first time? - Six. - What'd you just roll? - Six. - Six and six is 12. Craps, boxcars, big bennies, hh-hhhh. Whistle toots: I'm a bad boy. Detail, halt! Take it easy for a few minutes, boys. You'll be inoculated as soon as the jam's over. Hey, what are we waiting for? Let's go. - Go ahead. - Step up, boys, pick yourself a tie. Hey, get a load of them, fellas. 10c each, real silk. Won't rip or tear. See... Uh-oh. It must be one of the cheap nickel ones. - Put that grip away! - Yes, sir. - And don't sell any more ties out of that case! - Yes, sir. You heard what he said. Don't sell no more ties out of that case. - How does he expect us to make a living? - That's easy. Come on fellas. I've got ties. 10c each. Next. - I don't like this. - Next. Don't be scared. The doctor takes a needle. Like this, it's all over. Be brave. Next. Don't push, brother. Hi, shorty. - Next. - Don't be scared, I'm right behind you. Ouch! I hope they're not out of style when I get out. Here, clean 'em, press 'em, give 'em a double dose of moth balls and throw them away. Detail, halt! Right face! At ease, men. You may rest your equipment. I'm Captain Williams, Commanding Officer of this company and, men, I'm just as new to you as you are to me. But we all have the same job ahead of us. And I believe we'll find it an interesting one. A great many people are counting on our success... people from all the walks of life who are contributing to this great national defense program just as much as you or I. I refer to the factory workers, the farmers, the citizens whose taxes are paying for this training... the people of America. No one expects you to be seasoned soldiers overnight, but we're going to do everything we can to help you in every possible way. And I believe if we all work together that we'll make K company a unit of which any regiment can be proud. - Sergeant Callahan. - Yes, sir? - Appoint acting corporals and assign the men to tents. - Yes, sir. Sergeant, first seven men... last tent on your left. First seven men, right face! Next seven men... second to last tent on your left. I never knew you made your own bed at home. I must have forgotten to tell you. Man: Men, the new sarge! - 21 bucks a month to be a chambermaid. - Oh, fix it up. Hello, boys, I'm Collins, your Sergeant. - Smitty, that voice is very familiar. - Too familiar. - Who's acting corporal here? - I am, Sergeant. Well... this is going to be more fun than I expected. So you gentlemen are in my section? Not any more, we're resigning. - Herbie, pick up your things. - Right. Where are you going? To collect my social security. You can't collect your social security until you're 65. Seeing you I aged 35 years. - Oh, put that down. Put it... - Uh-oh. - Well. - It's a put up job. It's a frame up. Never saw the stuff before in all my life. In that case, you'll never miss this, will you? - That'll cost you a dollar and a half. - What?! - Who said that? Not me. Smitty, I don't think he likes me. Not bad. Not at all bad. - Where did you learn to make up a bunk? - Military school. Why didn't you tell the first sergeant? You might have been made acting corporal. You can have the whole army. By Monday I'll be through with it. Oh, so you're the one they've been talking about. - The dude with all the drag, huh? - That's me, Sarge. Only singing. Hey, you with all the drag, drag yourself over here and see if you can show these monkeys how to make up a bunk. And you two pay attention. If you can't stand up like a soldier, let's see if you can learn to sleep like one. Sergeant, will you tuck me in bed? Ahhh! Get rid of that thing! Throw it out! Understand?! Well, you heard what the sergeant said. Throw it out. Oooh! Hello, Bob. Having a little trouble? Yeah, sort of. You know, when you want to write a letter to a girl how would you start a love letter? There's only one way to write a love letter. Sweetheart, my own You don't know how I miss you Just thought I'd drop a line And let you know I'm fine Except I wish you were here I've been so blue What I'd give Just to kiss you It rained a bit tonight But now the stars are bright Gee, but I wish you were here Each night when lights are out I make up dreams about you and me And like the fairy tales I used to read They all end happily Sweetheart My own All: How I long To be with... You I miss you more each day All: There's not much else... To say Except I wish you Were here. Wonderful service. I got an answer to my letter before I even wrote it. Army service. Oh, I get it. Nothing personal, huh? I'll let you know about that one later. There's one thing you could tell me right now. Have you seen any more of my ex-boss, if you know what I mean? Uh-huh, I know what you mean. I haven't seen him. And I don't intend to. You don't know that man like I do. He'll be around. But so will I. Woman: Oh, Judy. You certainly get the cute ones. Miss Durling wants to see you. Thanks, honey. Miss Gray, this is Private Randolph Parker. How do you do, Miss Gray? - I'm very anxious to meet you. - How do you do? Mr. Parker saw you in the recreation hall tonight and asked for a formal introduction. Yes, you see I'm new around here and I don't make friends very easily. So I thought if Miss Durling could spare you, you might show me around. You don't know your way around? Not in this neighborhood. Now run along, you two. - Take good care of her, Randolph. - I'll do my best. And thank you, more than you know. - I had to see you... - This is the main recreation hall. Soda, soft drinks and ice cream may be purchased at the fountain as well as candy, cigarettes, cigars and razor blades. - Look, Judy... - In the reading room you'll find the latest copies of all magazines as well as a carefully selected library. The post office is the first building to the west. - Which way is west? - That way. You go out this door and turn... Oh, I'd never find that. A Yale man. There's the post office. You can see it from here. How about forgetting what happened on the train? What happened on the train? It's all your own fault you know. - My fault? - Certainly. Five double malts. Why don't you order another and make it and even half a dozen. - I don't want to make a pig out of myself. - Herbie. Yes, Corporal? Whoever touches the heads of those double malts dies like a dog... unquote. Ask any man if he'd pass up a chance to kiss you? Nonsense. I'll prove it to you. Hey, soldier. - Private Parker? - Yes? Captain Williams wants to see you right away. - Oh, excuse me. - That's fine. Maybe he's heard from the old man. I'd better go. - Of course. - Wait here. I'll be right back. Okay, Corp, she's all yours. Thanks, pal. I think you'll find it on the first shelf. You may not know it, but you've just been rescued. What do you mean? Captain doesn't want to see Parker, but I want to see you. Oh, I get it. The old army game. Hiya, neighbor. How you feeling? - Not a penny. - Aw, now come on. Herbie, did I ask you for any money? You've got that look in your eye. You cleaned me out in that crap game, didn't you? - You gave me a lesson, that's all I know. - Do me a favor, loan me $50. - Smitty, I can't. I can't lend you $50. - Yes you can. - No I can't. All I've got is $40. - Give me the $40 and you owe me 10. - Okay, I owe you 10. - That's right. How come I owe you 10? - What did I ask you for? - 50. - And how much did you give me? - 40. - So you owe me $10. - That's right. - You owe me 40. - Don't change the subject. I'm not changing the subject. You're trying to change my finances. Come on. Give me my $40. All right, there's your $40. - Now give me the $10 you owe me. - I'm paying you on account. - On account? - On account I don't know how I owe it to you. If that's the way you feel, it's the last time I'll ever ask you for $50. Wait a minute, Smitty. How can I owe you $50 now? - All I have is 30. - Give me the 30 and you owe me 20. This is getting worse all the time. First I owe him 10, now I owe him 20. Why do you run yourself into debt? I'm not running in. You're pushing me. I can't help it if you can't handle your finances. - I do all right with my money. - And you're doing all right with mine, too. Wait a minute, I asked you for $50, you gave me 30. So you owe me $20 dollars. 20 and 30 is 50. No, no, no. 25 and 25 is 50. All right, here's your $30. Give me back the 20 you owe me. Fine guy... won't loan a pal $50. How can I loan you 50? All I've got now is 10. To show you that I'm your pal, you want to double that? Go ahead. See you later. I don't want that kind of money. On the up and up, hold it. Now take a number. Any number at all from one to 10. - Don't tell me. - I got it. - Is the number odd or even? - Even. - Is the number between one and three? - No. - Between three and five? - No. I think I got him. - Between five and seven? - Yeah. - Number six. - Right. How did he do that? Mmmmmm! - See how I rolled that pack? - Very neatly. Some of you men have been getting away with murder. Brown... let me see you do it. - Ain't this a fine thing for the army to give anybody? - What's the matter? By the time you get this thing rolled and packed, you'd be too tired to fight. - Snap into it, Brown. - It's mutiny. - How can you be so stupid? - Oh, that just comes to me natural. Goodbye, boys, It's been nice knowing you. Parker, where do you think you're going? I just saw my father drive in, I thought I'd... Never mind about that. You stay here until the instruction period's over. All right, Brown, on his back now. On his back. No, not you, you idiot! The pack. Put the pack on his back. I thought we were going to play piggy-back. I haven't played since I was a kid. - You're still a kid. - I'm playing now. Come on, get it on. You've got more left hands than an entire company. - That's good, huh? - Quiet. I'll pick it up later, kid. I'll put it in my own pocket. - Get up there. - Give him a hand, Smith. You know what he said. Give me a hand. Give him a hand! Oh, hello. What are you doing tonight? You imbecile. Get your silly carcass off of me. Sergeant Collins. I'll attend to you later. - What's cookin', Sarge? - Get out of here! Private Parker! Report to brigade headquarters, immediately. Thanks, Sergeant. Well, boys, looks like this is it. All right, Mr. Parker. We'll try to see things your way. Private Parker reporting, sir. - Captain Williams ordered me to report to you. - At ease. - Hello, Dad. - Hello, son. You're looking better than your letters intimated. I feel fine, but I thought you'd forgotten about me. Your mother didn't give me a chance. I came down here as soon as I could. Did you fix everything up? I had a little difficulty, but everything's arranged. That's fine. - Why don't you take a look around while I get out of my uniform? - I can't. Why not? 'Cause I have to return to Washington at once. Because you're not getting out of that uniform. Dad, you just said... That I'd just fixed everything up. Well, I have. It seems that your father has a little more respect for army life and army institutions than you have, Parker. We were quite ready to cooperate with the Washington authorities... But I talked them out of it. This camp may be short of sport roadsters and chorus girls, but it's excellently equipped to make a man out of a playboy. You're going to stay here the full year... and like it. I'll be with you In apple blossom time Mmm-mmmm I'll be with you To change your name to mine Maybe one day In May I'll come and say Happy the bride That the sun shines on today Andrews Sisters: What a wonderful wedding There will be What a wonderful day For you and me Church bells will chime You will be mine In apple... Blossom time I'll be with you In apple blossom time Chorus: Then what will you do? Then I'll be with you To change your name to mine Men and women: When will that be? One day, maybe in May Men and women: Then what will you do? I'll come and say to you, dear Happy the bride That the sun shines on today Andrews Sisters: Then what... A wonderful wedding There will be One day in May What a very very wonderful day For you and me, dear Church bells will chime You will be mine Maxene, LaVerne: When? In apple... In apple blossom time. Did I remember to say thanks for keeping this date? Mere curiosity. - Curiosity? - Uh-huh. Why a certain soldier decided to stay in the army... that's gossip item number one in camp. Maybe he wanted to be near you. Of course. It couldn't be because the army might do him some good. What good? My dad had some pretty fair ideas about that. He was a captain in the fighting 69th. I remember mother telling me how he always believed that army life changed boys into men. He always said it was the great leveler. It doesn't care how much a man has in the bank or how little. All the army cares about is how much of a man a man can be. You're wasting your breath on him, Judy. The captain wants to see you at once. Very funny. Tell him I can't make it right now. And on your way, soldier. Oh, no, this is as far as I go. I said on your way! I said this is as far as I go. All right, we'll just have to pretend that you're not here. Now then, Judy, about Sunday. How do you think we should start our day? Judy's promised to spend her day off with me. Why don't we let Judy decide about that? Martin, did you tell Parker the captain wanted to see him? - I did, Sergeant. - What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation? - I thought he was kidding. - You get on over there. Captain's been waiting so long he's got corns on his hips. Okay, Sarge. Goodbye, Judy. - And you, Martin. - Yes, Sergeant? That bed of yours looks like a goat's nest. And your pillow... What have you been doing, picking a chicken? - I left it in order. - I suppose somebody else messed it up. - Somebody did... - You'll straighten it out. Now get going. - Judy, I'll... - Get going, soldier. Don't tell me he needs a valet to keep his things in order. As a matter of fact, he's rather neat about it. It took me every bit of 10 minutes to scramble it up. Say... by the way, isn't Sunday your day off? Oh, why, Sergeant? One, two, three, four. Detail, halt! Get back there. You first four men, right face! Forward, march! Detail, halt! Left face! Order arms! Ohh. You four men are undoubtedly the dumbest numbskulls I've ever had the misfortune of drilling. Private Smith, fall out. Smith, you seem to know what this is all about. I want you to take over these men, drill them for half an hour and see if you can sweat some sense into them. I'm exhausted. The rest of you men, follow me. Forward, march! Dick, put my gun in the rack. Attention! - Never mind that. - That's my pal. - Big man, he's a captain. - Wipe that smile off your face. Wipe it off! - Uhh... - Quiet! Quiet! What are you doing? - Talking to myself. - Well, don't talk so loud! - I've got to hear what I've got to say. - Quiet! - Count off. - One... - Two... - Three, four... - Bingo! - You behave yourself! Do you understand?! I won't warn you again. Get your chins up! Get your chest out! Throw out your chest! Get your chest out! Throw it out! - I'm not through with it yet. - Quiet. Right shoulder, arms! - Whoop! - Come on. - Pick it up. - I thought I had it. - Pick it up! - All right! - Come on, snap into it. - What's the matter, big man now? - Quiet! - Okay, okay. - Order, arms! - I'll have a cap pistol. You keep quiet! I won't warn you again! - All right. - All right. - Pick on somebody else. - Quiet! Right shoulder, arms! I said right shoulder, arms. That's your left shoulder. - I'm left handed. - Get it over! It feels better over here. Get it over there! Get it over there! Left shoulder, arms. Right shoulder, arms. Why don't you make up your mind? Get back there. Come on! - Right shoulder, arms. Left shoulder, arms... - Quiet! Do as you're told! Order arms. - Left shoulder, arms. Left shoulder, arms. - Quiet! Present, arms! Come on, I don't want it. I don't want it! - You want it? - Put it up there? Get it up! Right face! Come on, come on. Left face. Turn with the rest of 'em! That guy hit me! Turn with the rest of them! Pick it up! Right face! Oh, come on! Left face. Pick up that gun. Do as you're told. Turn with the rest of them. Pick it up! Right face! Right face! Forward, march! Halt! Halt! Halt! - Where are you going? - I don't know. You don't know? Well, find out. - Now get with it! - What time? None of your business. About face! Forward, march! - Hi, fellas. - Halt! Halt! You guys are going the wrong way. Will you get in line here! I don't know. You got me in this mess, brother. Right face. Forward, march. Halt! Right face. Forward, march. Halt! Right face. Forward march. Halt! Get a load of this. Left, face! Ah, gently. Right face! Right face! Whew! What a time we had with them three. Forward, march. Herbie: My feet are killing me. Mmmm, and do these shoes hurt. Well, no wonder. Look what you've got in them. How do you like that. And I thought I had fallen arches. - Boy, am I dumb. - You are dumb. And to prove to you how dumb you really are, suppose you had $5 in this pants pocket and $10 in this pants pocket. What would you have? - The captain's pants on. - There you are, you see... What are you asking me those kind of questions for? - Why don't you ask me a nice easy one? - All right. - Ask me something about that big. - Will you answer it? All right, say you're 40 years old... - Who's 40? - I mean just suppose... If I was 40 years old, I wouldn't be bathing my feet here in the water. I wouldn't be in the army. After all, I took my uncle's advice. My uncle told me, "Herbie, you go in the army. " - What uncle? - Uncle Sam. - All right... - He's my uncle, your uncle. He's everybody's uncle in the army. - I understand. - He's the only relative I've got. - I like my Uncle Sam. - We all do. Answer this question. You're 40 years old and you're in love with a little girl say 10 years old. This one's going to be a pip. - Wait till I finish. - Now I'm going around with a 10-year-old girl. - Wait a minute. - You've got a good idea where I'm going to wind up. You're 40 and in love with this little girl that's 10 years old. Now, you're four times as old as that girl. - You couldn't marry her. - Not unless I come from the mountains. - There you go... - Why don't you ask me...? Wait till I finish this. You're 40, she's 10. You're four times as old as that girl. You couldn't marry her, so you wait five years. Now the little girl is 15, you're 45. You're only three times as old as that little girl. So you wait 15 years more. Now the little girl is 30, you're 60. You're only twice as old as that little girl. - She's catching up. - Well, yes, yes. Now here's the question, how long do you have to wait before you and that little girl are the same age? Well? What kind of question is that? - Answer the question. - That's ridiculous. - What's ridiculous? - If I keep waiting she'll pass me up. - What are you talking about? - She'll wind up older than I am. - Then she'll have to wait for me. - Why should she wait for you? - I was nice enough to wait for her. - Aw, go to bed. Girl don't want to marry me, she don't have to marry me. - That's silliness. - I like her, I'll marry her. Wait a minute, where are you putting that water?! - Throw it out. - Brown, Smitty... You! You, I'll strangle you! I'm a bad boy. Man: Ready, aim... fire. - Nice shooting. - Nice shooting, fellas. Soldier: Boy, that's swell. Great shooting, Parker. Great shooting. Here, keep this and have it framed. What for? It isn't half as tough as a round of skeet. It's a shame. He's just as good as he thinks he is. He's plenty good with a gun all right. You're not so bad yourself. Man: Fire! - How're the men doing, Sergeant? - First in the regiment. Oh yeah, I've got some Tennessee boys in my company that can shoot the spots out of the five of spades at 300 yards. You call that shooting? Why, our boys at 500 yards can shuffle a deck of cards Maybe we can cook up a five-man match. Any day. Well, boys, our fortunes are made. Every dime of this company's money is on that rifle match tomorrow. Over $500. - Including my buck and a half. - Including the works. - We're all in but Parker. - Won't he bet on himself? - Collins said not to tell him. - Why not? Well, the sarge figures that there's not enough L company money to cover that millionaire's idea of a small bet. - What odds did you get? - Herbie's placing the money. - All: Herbie?! - Don't get excited boys. With his baby-face, they'll feel sorry for him. They're apt to give him five to four or seven to five. Five to four or seven to five? I got us a real bet. - You did? - 10 to one. 10 to one. Certainly, that's the boy... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who put up the 10? I did. 10 of ours to one of theirs. - 10 to one. - You did?! Mm-hmm. What's the matter? Did I do something wrong again? Sergeant: Parker. How's your trigger finger, my boy? I... I haven't made up my mind yet. Good afternoon, ma'am. You're going my way? Hello. If you're waiting for Martin, he won't be able to keep his date. Oh. - Oh, I see. The captain wanted to see him. - No. He's shooting with the company rifle team. Hear him? I thought you were the star of the team. I was until this morning. Then the strangest thing happened to my wrist. I could hardly move it. So when I told Captain Williams about it, he replaced me with the sixth man on the score-sheet. - And Bob was the sixth man, of course. - Of course. - How does your wrist feel now? - What do you think? And you walked out on your rifle team just to chisel a date with me, is that it? You're a lot more attractive than any target in this camp. The men you sold out in your company bet every cent they had on the team, on you. They did? I didn't know that. I'll make their losses good. - With what, money? - What else? It's just that easy for you, isn't it? I'll tell you one thing, there's no price tag on loyalty or friendship. I didn't ask for this uniform. Why should I take it seriously? After what you did today, the only friend you'll have is the guy who looks at you out of the mirror. And if he had any sense, he'd stay as far away from you as I'm going to. Wait a minute! Hello, boys. I'm sorry we lost the rifle match. What do you mean "we"? I'll make your losses good if you'll tell me how much you dropped. I think I'll take a walk. There's a strange smell around here. Wait a minute, boys, I said I was sorry. What do you want me to do, back flips? Yeah, wise guy, and we're the boys that can flip you. - Now listen, you... - Don't you sock him, Henry. Come on, boy. Give it to him, Bob. Ooh, it's the sergeant. Move... move it. It's the sergeant. Ooh! - We'll finish this later. - You mean I will. Herbie, the light. The light. No, no, no, turn it out. What kind of a brawl is going on in here? Don't you recruits dummy up on me. Oh, so it's you, eh? Yeah, it's me. I wasn't doing anything. I wasn't doing any fighting. I guess that's how you got that black eye, huh? Yeah... I got a black eye? - Ooh. - Dry up. Keep quiet or you'll find yourself on KP. I don't want to hear another peep out of this tent. - Douse that light. - Okay. It won't go out. What a life. What an army and what a sergeant to have in the army. Give me liberty or give me death. That's me. Who's playing that radio?! - Nobody, it's playing by itself. - Turn it off! Be quiet in here. The men have to get up at 5:45 in the morning. - Go on and play it. - You heard what the guy said. What are you worrying about him? He's only the sergeant. What, are you scared of him? Play the radio loud. What did I tell you?! Didn't I tell you the men were sleeping? Didn't I tell you they have to get up at 5:45 in the morning?! Well now don't play it! Go on and play it. - You're an American citizen, aren't you? - Hmm. This is a free country, isn't it? Go on and play the radio. If he come in here again, I'll tell him off. - You'll tell him? - You leave it to me. Play it. - Didn't I say not to play that thing?! - Yeah. - Didn't I say the men were sleeping? - When are you gonna tell him? - What are you going to do about it? - Look here, Brown, I don't like wise guys. - Sorry. Next wisecrack out of you, somebody's going to punch you right in the nose. I'd like to see you do it. I'll do it all right. Why don't you be quiet like your buddy here? Now remember, the next wisecrack out of you, I'll punch you right in the nose. Yes you will. Yes I will! Yes I will! When are you gonna tell him? Nobody loves me. Who's got a pencil and paper? I'm going to write the President of the United States a letter. - What the matter now, Herbie? - I'm going to hand in my notice. Don't look now, brother, but you're missing a leg. What are you, a wise guy or a salesman? I've been around. Did I hear a radio playing in here? - There's no radio in here. - Don't let me hear any carousing. - Yes, ma'am - What? - Yes, sir. - That's better. - You've got to be one or the other. - Go ahead and play it. - You heard what the sergeant said. Never mind him. I'll take care of him. - It's a free country, ain't' it? - Yes. - You an American citizen? - Yes. Go ahead and play it. And loud. You know... Wait a minute. - Take it easy, I'm on your side. Please be my friend. That sergeant always makes me boil I'd like to fry that guy in oil No matter what you do he's always squawkin' But you just wait and don't forget I'll get to be a captain yet And that's the day that I'll do all the talkin' Men: Three cheers for the red, white, and Captain Brown Hip, hip, hip, hooray... My buddies! - What did you do? - I'll scramble it later. When I become a captain The title will be strictly unofficial I won't be highfalutin Forget about salutin' Just step up and call me by my first initial Men: Three cheers for the red, white and Captain B Hip, hip, hip, hooray! My buddy! Snow this time of the year? It's marvelous. Well, I'll see you later. When I become a captain They'll be no bugle calls to spoil your slumber There'll be no KP duties and we'll draft a bunch of cuties And instead of doing drills we'll do the rumba... What are you doing?! Men: Three cheers for the red, white and Captain Brown Hip, hip, hip, hooray! What do you think is wrong with this army? I'm glad you asked me that, my friend, and I can tell you in just two words: Pa-lenty! Get the rest of the boys down here, I'll tell you. Come on, fellas. Now, the way I see it, There's too much cold and too much heat Too many MPs walking a beat too many hikes and too many marches Too many feet with fallen arches Too much water in the soup, too many pairs of pants that droop Too many orders, too many drills, iodine and quinine pills Too much mud and too much rain too many aches and too much pain Too many blisters, too many corns too many drums and too many horns, whhaaaaa Too much working like a slave Too many spots that need a shave Too many rules and too much law Well it's the darndest mess I ever saw Three cheers for the red, white and Captain Brown Hip, hip, hip, hip Hooray. So you want to be a captain, huh? Well, I've had a talk with the general about you and we've decided to make you an admiral. Admiral? Ooh, ooh. Do they have admirals in the army? Sure, we're going to put you in charge of all the vessels. Oh, goody. Three cheers for the red, white and Captain Brown... Vessels! Hip, hip, hip, hooray! Hiya, boys. Good fight, huh?

Private Bill McGuire of L Company... ...challenges any man... particularly any man from K company! Men, are we going to backwater and let them get away with that? - Men: No! - Are we? - What are you looking at me for? - Certainly not. Not after the way those L men clipped us in that rifle match. Yeah, that rifle match. Remember that, boys? Who's going to stand up and volunteer for the honor of K Company? Somebody over here should volunteer over there. Well, who's going to stand up and volunteer? Wow! That's the proper company spirit! Come on, I've got some trunks that will fit you perfectly. I don't want to fight that guy. I ain't even mad at him. You mean to say you're scared of that little guy over there? I mean to tell you that I'm... - Is that the guy I'm going to fight? - Yeah. Tell that fella to stay in the ring. - He's a pushover. - Sure. Boy, I can picture myself now. The place is crowded, I'm coming down the aisle, I jump in the ring, I throw off my robe, and the whole crowd lets out a terrific roar. - What happened? - I forgot to put on my pants. Come on. Come on. Okay, boys, okay. Relax, entertain yourselves till Private Brown gets into his fighting togs.

All right, you boys know the rules: no fighting in the clinches, break clean, and no hitting below the belt. - You mean I can't do that? - No, you can't do that. - You can't do this with your thumb. - I can do that? That's all right but you can't do that. - Back to your corners and commence fighting. I don't want to fight. Get in there and fight. Mix it up. Where is he? You can't find me. Oh! It didn't hurt. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... Count, count, count! All right, mix it up. Herbie, give him the one-three. The one-three. - Herbie: Huh? - Okay, break...

Forward, ho! - I'm going to write my congressman about this. - Yeah, what's the idea? Quiet, no talking in the ranks! Cover! What'd I have to join the army for? - Defend your native soil. - Well, they don't have to feed it to me. - What is this all about? - Looks like a sham battle to me. - Sham battle? - Yeah. I should have stayed home in bed. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the radio audience. This is Mike Frankovitch speaking to you directly from the central observation point for the most extensive army maneuvers ever attempted by the United States in peacetime. Just remember you're being watched by umpires, by staff officers whose duty it will be to report on the conduct of every company. Unofficially, I can tell you that the company receiving the best report will be named top company of this regiment. How can the umpire figure out the right answer if we don't really shoot the other guy? That's easy. Everybody knows that. All you do is... you tell him. With a book of rules. For example, if 10 of our men of the white army catch up with 8 men of the blue army, we outnumber them, so we've captured them. They cut loose five of their tanks against one of ours, our tank is destroyed. We have a plane that drops a flour sack... that is supposed to be a bomb. If it lights on a battery of field artillery, the battery is wiped out. You understand? Yeah, but how do I know if I get killed? The umpire hangs a sign on you reading, "This mug is as dead as he looks. " You see, that's the only way they could... All the latest developments in mechanized air and land equipment are being employed in this extensive maneuver. Present here to observe these maneuvers in addition to commanding officers of the two opposing armies are high ranking officials of the War Department as well as military observers from Central and South America. Take cover over here on signal, men. All right, up. Wait a minute. Where's Herbie? Where's...? Herbie, how did you get up in that tree? How did I get up in the tree? I sat on it when it was an acorn! Mmm-mmmm-mmmm. Mike: Latest reports from the front indicate that the blue army is rapidly approaching the Schuylerton Reservoir and it appears certain that they will gain control of that vital spot and be declared the winner of these maneuvers. Men, three miles west of here is a blockhouse. That's a marker for the Schuylerton Reservoir. Our section has been given the vital job of getting to that blockhouse and blowing it up before it can be surrounded by the blue army. We've got orders here to split up into three patrols of four men. Each patrol will attempt to gain the objective from a different approach. One must get through and blow up that blockhouse before it's captured by the blue army. Now the first patrol, Corporal Martin in charge, Parker, Smith and Brown. Toss up your rifles. No, come on. Me, me. - Stand still. - Bob: Shake a leg, Smitty. Wait a minute. Hold still now. Lift me up. Come here... nobody. - Come on. - Wait for me, will you? All right, come on, fellas. Martin! Look out, Smitty. That's loose rock. Climb on up to the next ledge. Grab my ankle. Climb up over me. Work your way around that next ledge and go back. Thanks, fella, you saved my life. You owe me a nickel. - You all right? - Yeah. Let's go. Your inexperienced soldiers have done a fine job holding out as long as they did. They have done splendidly, but the maneuver isn't lost yet. One of our patrols hasn't been captured and it's just possible that those men might reach their objective. Bob: It looks like we got here ahead of the blue army. Yep. Go on, get down there and blow up the blockhouse. So you can tell Judy how you gave me a chance to be a hero? Oh no. It's better than her thinking I grabbed the glory by outranking you. Go on, get going. Look, blue army patrol heading for the blockhouse. Give me your pistol, quick. - What are you going to do? - Surround the blues with a whole company. - What? - You blow up the blockhouse. I'll attract their attention and draw them away. Why those kid soldiers. I'll bet not one of them comes within a mile of that blockhouse. Not a chance with every road covered. Let's get over there and hoist blue flags. What the? There might be more of them than us, but we've got to get over there and head them off. Come on, up and at 'em. Well, hello, boys. Looking for me? Well, there you are, Parker. I've been looking all over camp for you. Why aren't you over with the other fellas? They seem a bit allergic to me or hadn't you noticed? Report to brigade headquarters, immediately. Thanks, Sergeant. Private Parker, sir. Captain Williams ordered me to report to you. - At ease. - Hello, son. Hello, Dad, nice seeing you. General Emerson has some news for you. A transfer to the Officers' Training School. - No thank you, sir. - Don't you want a commission? I want one very much, sir, but I've heard that it's possible to get an appointment from the ranks. Thanks for the string-pulling, Dad. I had nothing to do with this transfer. That's right. You were recommended by your colonel along with other men who've shown exception ability. Thank you, sir. Hello, Randy, how're you feeling? You sure put it over, pal. - Howdy, Randy. - Hello, Randy Boy. Nice going, soldier. Save me a dance later. And remind me to give you my phone number. Thattaboy, soldier. Say, what kind of beat is that? Man, that really spins my hat Doesn't sound like boogie woogie But it's really got a beat Maxene, LaVerne: Seems to us that it's in four Let us hear it just once more Come on and latch onto that rhythm All: 'Cause a solid boy's my meat Some folks like to hear eight-beat rhythm I don't go for that stuff no more Anytime you really want to send me Bounce me, brother, with a solid four Come on in, the whole place is jumpin' Everybody's out on the floor If you want to keep the rhythm pumpin' Bounce me, brother, with a solid four The boogie woogie was never like this We've got a new beat that no one can miss If boogie woogie sent you like I think it did Four to the bar will flip your lid Move the tables and roll the rug up Shut the windows and lock the door While I try to dig the little brown jug up Bounce me, brother, with a solid four Da-da-da-da- da-da-da-da-da Clank, clank, clank, clank The joint is jumping as it never did before Clank, clank, clank They're saying bounce me, brother, with a solid four. The boogie woogie was never like this We've got a new beat that no one can miss If boogie woogie sent you like I think it did Four to the bar will flip your lid Move the tables and roll the rug up Shut the windows and lock the door While I try to dig the little brown jug up Bounce me, brother, with a solid four. - Randy! - Hello, Randy. - I'll buy you a soda. - I'll buy you a man's drink... a double malted. - I thought you guys were broke. - Broke? Does this look like we were broke? We just about busted the blue army at 10 to one, thanks to you. - To me? - Yes, Bob's told us and everybody else how you won the sham battle. - Bob told you. - Yeah. It's really something, overcoming the handicap of being a millionaire. Gee, I wish I was handicapped like that. May I have this dance, soldier? What are we waiting for? Make way, boys. Another handicap. - Excuse me. - Hello, boys. Did I clean out the blue army? Did you? What about us? Show him, Herbie. Look what I won. - Did you ever shoot dice? - Dice, no. Shall we step in here? I would be glad to accept your most cordial invitation. - Come along. - Clubhouse. - No cutting, I'm sorry. - Who wants to cut? - The captain wants to see you. - Oh, not that old gag. Look, pal, this is my last night in camp and last dance with our girl. Now isn't that a coincidence. Mine, too? - You, too? - Officers' Training School in the morning. Oh, that's swell, Bob. Congratulations. And thanks for everything. - What for? - Never mind. - We're going... - Both: to miss you a lot, Judy Oh, no you're not. Both: Oh, yes we are. - All right, you take it. - I'm going to miss you, Judy. I don't think so, because it so happens that I've been transferred, too. Don't tell me that they have hostesses at the Officers' Training School. Now isn't that a coincidence? - We're lucky fellas. - Mr. Smith. You're a lucky fellow, Mr. Smith Look around you and get a good view In the shops and stores and down in the mines Everybody works for you There are farmers plowing in the soil And the factories are running full speed Just to back you up 100% And to follow where you lead Wheels are turning and they're hard at work The wealthy man, little man, banker and clerk They're punching for you so you do your part All the power they need is the beat of your heart We're 130 million strong And we're sticking with you right along This is really your lucky day So, buddy, what do you say? All: Just throw your hats to the sky Up where the stars and stripes fly And keep your country rolling it high You're a lucky fellow, Mr. Smith.
