[CHOPlN`S WALTZ lN C-SHARP MlNOR PLAYlNG ON PlANO] -Hello, Aunt Nona. -Hello, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, I forgot it was so late. I sat down to play Chopin, one piece led to another. But, darling, dinner will be ready in just a jiffy. Thank you, dear. -Oh, Cynthia. -Something`s happened. Uh-huh. Oh, I wanted you to have such a nice, hot dinner. You need one after a day of such damp work... ...but something went wrong with the gas range. -What?. -The gas. It stopped coming out. It was on, and then, pfft... ...it was off. -Aunt Nona, did you pay the bills?. -Of course, I did-- Why, didn`t l?. Oh, l`m sure I did. Well, almost sure. I know I deposited my annuity check. So I must have plenty of money in the bank. And anyway, dear, if I haven`t, they always tell me. Oh, that`s where that was. I know I wrote checks for all the bills and sent them off. Yes, I distinctly remember licking the stamps. [CYNTHlA LAUGHS] Oh, darling, l`ll go see about dinner right away. -lt`ll be cold, l`m afraid. -Oh, that`s all right. Oh, by the way, I think I found a rather interesting headline... ...for Uncle Hoby`s collection. Is he home?. Uh-huh. In the study. He`s pasting away. -Hello, mermaid. Have a good day?. -Swell. Got a pretty good headline for you. -Yeah?. Ha, ha. -Mm-hm. ""Man with Three Wives Asks `Why Not?. `"" Fair question. Thank you, dear. I`ll put it right in the book. Cynthia, in the headlines, you find all the wisdom... ...and all the foolishness of the alleged human race. I collect the foolishness. There`s more of it. Uncle Hoby, what are these?. -They look like letters. -Mm-hm. They are. The gas company, phone company, light company.... I meant to mail them but I didn`t happen to pass a mailbox. In more than a month?. Put them right back in my pocket, l`ll mail them tomorrow. -Oh, no. I`ll mail them myself. -Now, don`t you forget. I just remembered the electricity is on. We`re going to have such a nice dinner. Tea, and toast, and jam, and beans, and salad-- Oh, you`d better punch holes in the tops of those bean cans, they`ll blow up. Oh, I know that. So will canned corn. Remember?. [NONA CHUCKLES] Now, where did I put that can opener?.

Oh, aren`t they lovely?. -Who are they from?. -Well, I don`t know. -Doesn`t it say on the card?. -No. All it says is, ""Thanks for the swan dive."" Cynthia, you`ve got a beau. Who is he?. Tell me. Well, I don`t know who he is or anything about him. Except that he was rather attractive and important-looking. -Do we take Fortune Magazine? -Fortune Magazine? No, I don`t think so. This copy just came by special messenger. -Oh, it`s for you, Cynthia. -For me?. I don`t subscribe to it. -Maybe they`d like you to. -No. Here`s something written here. It says, ""Dear Miss Glenn, please see page 98."" Look for me, will you, Uncle Hoby?. ""The Making of a New Tycoon. Five years ago, Robert G. Delbar had a pygmy business."" Pygmy business?. Why, I didn`t know they ever sold them. Shh, shh. ""Today, he has an industrial giant. The rapid growth of the Delbar Corporation which manufactures products... ...made of the new plastic material, Praktikon... ...is due chiefly to the shrewdness and super-salesmanship... ...of its young president, Bob Delbar."" Yes, that`s right, Miss MacKenzie. I want flowers sent to her everyday. Lots of flowers. And, uh, you`d better cancel all my other social engagements... ...and, uh, make out a list of places to take her to. I see, Mr. Delbar. This is to be an all-out sales campaign. Precisely. Where`d be a good place to take her to today?. Well, how about the races?. -Come on, Papoose. -I bet on Whirlabout. Come on, come on, Papoose. Come on. Yes?. MACKENZlE [OVER lNTERCOM] : Take her to the Ice Follies. I have four tickets. -Why four?. -It will help if you sell yourself to her family. Oh, yes. -Hoby?. -Huh?. When we get home, remind me to defrost the icebox. Mm-hm. [BAND PLAYlNG SWlNG MUSlC] -Didn`t your uncle ever do any work?. -No, he doesn`t believe in it. -So?. -Hm. But he`s happy and so is Aunt Nona. -Are you?. -Hmm. Yes, I am. We lead a very pleasant life. Auntie and Uncle have an income and it`s enough for them to live on. I know. It`s 300 a month and they pay their bills when they remember to... ...so their credit is good. I know all about you too. You were born here in Los Angeles. Your father was a doctor. Your parents died when you were 7. You attended high school and the university. You got fairly good marks. You were popular. -How do you know so much about me?. -I made it my business to find out. And.... Everything I found out about you, Cynthia, I like. -Thank you. -Excuse me, Mr. Delbar. -Well, there`s J.P. Bancroft. -Really?. Will you excuse me?. -Well, hello, Bob. -Hello, J.P.

Well, as soon as l`ve arranged an interview, l`ll let you know. And you`d better be there. Don`t worry, l`ll be there. Nothing could stop me. -Well, very pretty. -I think so. -See you in Washington. Goodbye, J.P. -Goodbye, Bob. Nice to have met you, Mr. Carker. Yeah. There`s a very able fellow. He`ll be right up there on top someday too. Great man, J.P. I suppose he`s the richest man in the country today. -More wine?. -No, thank you. He and I have a big deal on. If it goes through, it`ll mean a lot to Praktikon and to me. What were you and Mr. Bancroft saying about me?. He asked me who you were. And I told him you`re the girl l`m going to marry. Congratulations. Relatives of the bride. I guess Bob was right about wanting to have the wedding in his house. -lt is nicer than ours. -Well, anyway, it`s bigger. We could have rented chairs, but he insisted and insisted. Yeah, he`s quite an insister. -I do hope Cynthia will be happy. -Yeah, I hope so too. You know, dear, I don`t think l`d like to be married to Bob, would you?. Well, I haven`t given the matter much thought, but offhand, l`d say no. [KNOCKlNG] JULlO: Lady?. -Yes. -I would like to see Senorita Glenn. -Well, she`s busy getting married. Yes, I know.

We ought to get started if we`re going to get to the hotel before dark. This is an old friend, a gentleman friend. Oh, who is he?. Bob, you don`t need to be jealous of him. He`s one of the boys from my swimming class. -But, Cynthia, you haven`t time-- CYNTHlA: Yes, I have. -Hello, Julio. -Hello, Senorita Glenn. -l`m Mrs. Delbar now, Julio. -Yes, Senorita Glenn. I have brought to you a present. Thank you. Where is it?. It is not very nice. I could not buy anything very nice, or anything. Come with me, please, I will show you. [SlGHS] Julio. Julio, that was perfect. You did learn. -For you, senorita, that is my present. -Oh. Cynthia, you`ll ruin your dress. I won`t need it again. [PLAYlNG ""HERE COMES THE BRlDE""] CLERK: Good evening, Mr. Delbar. -Good evening. Hmm. I see you`re using my pen. -Your pen, sir?. -One of them. Look, dear. Praktikon.

It really doesn`t matter, we`re going down to dinner in a moment. When you come back, everything will be perfect. -Business is good here at the hotel. -Splendid. Every bed is taken. We`ve had a rather tempting offer for the use of the billiard table. Anyone special staying here?. Well, we have Major Thomas Milvaine... ...the flyer who shot down all those Japs. And then we have the daughter of J.P. Bancroft. -Oh, really?. -Yeah, she just arrived. Do you know her?. No, I know her father. We`ll have to look her up. Then we have-- Uh, who else?. Let me see. [NlLS SlNGlNG LEONCAVALLO`S ""VESTl LA GlUBBA""] Oh, of course, the Great Dane. Nils Knudsen of the Metropolitan Opera. He`s one of our regular patrons. He comes here to take off weight, a hundred pounds. A very nice man, but a bit of a problem child when he`s on a diet. I have to be quite severe with him. CYNTHlA: Pardon me. -Oh, there`s my wife. Will you excuse me?. Of course, I do hope you`ll enjoy your stay here. I expect to. [WOMAN SlNGlNG ""l SHOULD CARE""] Bob, look, Tommy Dorsey, the same orchestra. Same as what?.

But your diet says only vegetables. Vegetables. The only vegetables I like are steak and beer. -Bring me some right away. -No, sir. You heard what I said. But you said that no matter what you say, I am to say, "" No, sir."" -But, Oscar, only a little steak. A little beer. -No, sir. But look at me. I am so empty, so thin. -I could ask maybe Mrs. Fenway. -Never mind. She`d say no. -lt`s funny. -What?. -Our being married. -You`re not sorry already?. Oh, no, darling. When I said, ""l do,"" I meant it. But after all, Bob, we really don`t know each other so very well. Well, we should. We`ve had time to study each other. Yes, a whole month. And what a month. You know, being courted by you was like being swept over Niagara Falls in a canoe. [BOTH LAUGH] FENWAY: Good evening, John. -Good evening, Mrs. Fenway. Good evening. -Oh, Nils, good evening. -Good evening. -And how are you tonight?. -Oh, same as last night, Sara. Healthy, but hungry.

Wait a minute. Hello, J.P., can you get them to postpone that meeting a few days?. Ah, well, for me to leave right now would be awfully inconvenient. I`m on my honeymoon. He says the appointment won`t wait. I guess l`ll have to go. All right, Bob. Okay, J.P., l`ll be on that plane. I`ll see you in the morning. Goodbye. I`m sorry, darling, but it`s such a big deal. I`ll go and throw some things into a bag. -You didn`t unpack. -Oh, that`s a break. -They`re on their honeymoon. -l`m glad somebody`s happy. DORSEY: And now, ladies and gentlemen, for your pleasure, I hope... ...but chiefly to keep peace in my family... ...you`re about to witness the first appearance... ...of a young lady very close to my heart. Miss Susan Dorsey. [APPLAUSE] -Scared?. -Uh-huh. -Then l`ll do it. -No, I will. All right. But try not to be too hammy.

I`d have been quite lonely if I hadn`t picked you up in the pool. -Oh, but I picked you up. -Well, we picked each other up. And now we have to put each other down. Of course. But we did have a very amusing week, didn`t we?. I had a very beautiful week. And it`s not quite over.

Oh, go away. -Go away and knock yourself out. -Now-- Oh, but it is nice to be in love. -Sometimes. -Always. -You speak as an expert. -I do. An expert is what I am. You should be. You`ve been in love often enough. Not often enough, but as often as possible. I remember every girl as if she were yesterday. What a memory. And I daresay, there were.... Dozens and dozens. You see, I went on long tours with opera companies. Could I sing all the time?. I`m glad I fell in love so much. It`s good for the voice. Besides, it gives me something to think about now. Now, stop looking wistful. You know you can`t have any beer. -People can love what they can`t have. -Yes. But they shouldn`t. -And don`t you be a gossip. -I just made a remark. -What time are you leaving tomorrow?. -ln the morning, early, quite early. Where are you going?.

Oh, l`m talking about love. Please get this straight. -I am not in love with Mrs. Delbar. -All right. I believe you. Not because you say so, but because you`re passing up a chance... ...to be with her for another week, maybe longer. When I talked to my father on the telephone... ...he didn`t know when he could get out here. But I don`t quite understand what your father has to do with this. That`s why Bob Delbar`s waiting, isn`t it?. So that he can come out with Dad?. Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

[LAUGHS] No. I don`t quite see it that way. Tommy, no matter how long my husband`s away... ...I`m not going to let you make love to me. Oh, Cynthia, I love you too much to want you for just a little while. Please remember what I said if you do stay. All right, but l`m going to stay. All right, but don`t forget the hedge. I wanna make a long-distance call to Washington. Mr. Robert G. Delbar at the Hotel Grand View. [PHONE RlNGlNG] Hello?. Hmm?. Oh, Cynthia. Hello, dear. Bob, can you come back right away?. Huh?. Why?.

Now, Tommy. Well, you asked for it. Oh, look, what a darling little brook. THOMAS: Shh. [WHlSPERS] It thinks it`s a waterfall. [WHlSPERS] Maybe we discovered it. Yeah, maybe. I don`t remember this part of the woods. I don`t think we ever came this far before. We`d better be turning back pretty soon. I guess so, before the light goes. Look, somebody`s been here before. A loves E. That`s the history of the world. Adam loves Eve. Albert loves Emily. Alice loves Eddie. Yes, that happens too. This was done years ago. I wonder where they are now. Did they marry and live happily ever after?. Do they still love each other?. Or did they part?. Oh, Tommy, Tommy. -You love me. -No, no. Yes, you do. Yes, no, I don`t know. You know I love you. Tommy, what am I gonna do?. Tell Bob about us. -No, I can`t. -Then I will. -No, no, you mustn`t. -Why not?. Because l`m not sure about us. I`m not sure about anything. I am. I`m sure you`re the girl l`ve always thought about, waited for. Oh, l`ve got to be fair to Bob. Give our marriage a chance... ...give him a chance and l`m going to. But, Cynthia darling. No, Tommy. There`s only one way out of this. We`ve got to say goodbye and mean it. I couldn`t mean it. I can because I know I must. Now, we`re going back to the hotel... ...and just as soon as we get there, I want you to go away... ...and I don`t want you to come back ever. Please don`t, Tommy. Take me back now. All right. We came past this tree. Now we go to the left. -No, to the right. -No, the left. Tommy, I think we`re going in the wrong direction. No. We came from the east, didn`t we?. -Yes. -Obviously we must go east. But are we going east?. Sure we are. Now we`ll try your way. Oh. Wait. Let`s sit down and rest a moment. -You know what?. -Hmm. I think we`re just a little bit lost. Oh, no, of course not. Can`t be much further. We ought to be there pretty soon now. I was sure that if we just turned right, that-- [SlGHS] Yup. Same old tree. Well, anyway, we`re holding our own. And you found your way out of the jungle?. Well, it took me a month. Let`s be on our way. Oh, l`m sorry. I can`t go another step. Well, we`ll just camp here till morning. I guess we`ll have to. Oh, no, you take it. No, you take it. What time do you want to be called?. Daybreak. Daybreak. Good night, Tommy. Good night. Hey, look, there`s George! -Good morning, Mr. Bancroft. -Good morning. -l`m Robert Delbar. -Oh, yes, Mr. Delbar. Look, J.P., Praktikon. -Well, thank you, thank you. MAUDE: Hello, Father. Hello, Maude, well, did you get up early or stay up late?. -Both. -Oh, this is Mr. Delbar. Bob, my daughter. -How do you do?. -How do you do?. I`ve wanted to meet you. I met your wife. She`s very attractive. Glad she got to know someone. -I didn`t want her to be lonesome. -Oh, I don`t think she was too lonesome. Ha, ha. Bob, why don`t you and Mrs. Delbar have breakfast with us in our suite?. Thank you. We`d like to very much. -l`ll get Cynthia and we`ll be right in. -Okay. Cynthia. Cynthia. [DOORBELL BUZZES] Well, come in, Bob. Where`s the bride?. -I don`t know. -What?. I can`t find her. Well, she`s probably in the hotel somewhere. No, she isn`t. I asked everybody. I looked everywhere. -Nobody has seen her. -Wasn`t she in her room?. No, she was not. It looks very much as though she hadn`t been in her room at all last night. -Really?. -Are you sure?. Her bed hadn`t been slept in and my phone message was still under the door. What does it look like?. Well, now, don`t upset yourself by imagining things. Sit down. In this case, l`m sure there`s a perfectly simple explanation. -Yes, l`m sure there is. -Yes. Miss Bancroft, if you know anything I should know, please tell me. I don`t know anything. Really, I don`t. When did you last see my wife?. Early last evening, she was starting out for a walk in the woods. -Was she alone?. -Yes, she started out alone. BANCROFT: Maybe she`s still in the woods. All this time?. No, it`s not very probable. Well, it`s possible. I think you should send out searching parties. Don`t you, Maude?. Uh, no, I don`t think so. Look. -Bob. -Good morning. -Oh, Bob, I didn`t know you were back. -Evidently. This is Major Milvaine. -How do you do?. -How do you do?. -We got lost. -Uh, in the woods. It got dark and we got lost. Good and lost. We walked and walked and-- -All night?. -No, not all night. Oh, we did stop to rest. We had to. I`m very sorry this had to happen, but we couldn`t help it. Mrs. Delbar went out for a little walk... ...and I went out for a little walk and we met in the woods. So we started walking along together... ...got to talking and didn`t watch the time or notice where we were going... ...and we finally turned around and started back. It was still light but we didn`t know where we were or where the hotel was. She thought it was that way and I thought it was that way. It was neither way. Then it got to be pretty dark... ...and you know how dark it can get in those woods. So what could we do?. Now look, Delbar, I don`t care how it looks to you or to anybody else... ...this was an accident and you have no right to think it was more than that. If you have any sense, you`ll believe me... ...and you`ll believe your wife. I assure you-- There`s no need to assure me anything about my wife. Come, Cynthia. -Goodbye, Major Milvaine. -Goodbye, Mrs. Delbar. -Here`s your coat. -Thanks. Bob, l`m sorry I wasn`t here to meet you. So am l. Well, l`ll go make myself more presentable. Cynthia, that Major Milvaine, isn`t he the fellow... ...that had all those things happen to him in the South Pacific?. Yes. He, uh, got lost in the jungle, didn`t he?. Yes. And found his way out of the jungle?. Yes, took him a month. Quite an experience. Did he tell you much about it?. No, not much. Tommy doesn`t talk much about himself. Oh, Tommy is an old friend of yours, hmm?. No, l-- I met him the night you went away. Who introduced you?. Well, nobody really. I was out here on the balcony and he spoke to me and.... Neighbors, hmm?. Well, I really must change my clothes. Cynthia, he fell in love with you, didn`t he?. Well, didn`t he?. Bob, please don`t cross-examine me like this. You`ll have to trust me. You don`t expect me to believe that you and that fellow-- -Yes, I do. -Do you think l`m a fool?. No. No, I don`t. But I am beginning to think you`re a stuffed shirt. -I could call you names. -You better not. I`m glad I found out in time just how little our marriage meant to you. Bob, our marriage did mean something to me. It meant a lot. I wanted to make a go of it. I tried to. Yes, by falling in love with another man. Why don`t you tell me the truth?. That is the truth, isn`t it?. Yes. Yes, it is. I`ll tell you and l`ll tell myself. I am in love with Tommy. I`m going to get an annulment just as soon as I can. -You`ll be given an adequate settlement. -No. I don`t want any settlement. -You don`t?. -No. But l`ll take that annulment, thank you. Bob... ...don`t forget your briefcase. [DOOR CLOSES] Oh, Lyonel, would you, uh, get my bag please?. -Yes, major. Major Milvaine?. -Yes. You`re coat is dirty. You want me to brush you off?. No, thanks. I`ve been brushed off. Hello, Major Tommy. Oh, hello, Mister Knudsen, and goodbye. -Where do you go?. -To Darwin Field. I`m going to be stationed there. My young friend... ...I know that you will be unhappy for a while... ...but you mustn`t be unhappy for long. -You must fall in love again. -Yeah. And you will. Anyhow, you`ll try to. Yes, yes, l`ll try. Goodbye, Mister Knudsen. -Goodbye and good luck, Major Tommy. -Thank you. [DOORBELL BUZZES] -Oh, Mr. Delbar. Come in. -May I use your phone?. Of course. Hello. Hello, get me Austin Demmering in Los Angeles... ...Kimball 2-8-9-8. I`ll hold the wire. Oh, thanks. Get that other little matter settled?. This is it. I`m getting an annulment. Yeah, I thought you would. -What`s it going to cost you?. -Nothing. Hmm. That`s fair enough. Uh, hello, Austin, Bob Delbar. What do I have to do to get my marriage annulled?. Oh, Bob, you are not married again?. You can`t be married. You aren`t divorced. You got the divorce a year and a half ago. I know, but I never picked up the final papers and-- No, no, it`s not as bad as you think it is. Now, uh, take care of this for me right away. Both, the final decree and the annulment. You need a drink. Oh, thanks. Well, better luck next time. Thanks. All right. -Will you get a car for me, Lyonel?. -Yes, Mrs. Delbar. I`ll be out as soon as I say goodbye to Mr. Knudsen. He`s going to buy me singing lessons. Isn`t he the nicest man?. Indeed, he is. Well, goodbye, Mr. Knudsen. You`ve been very kind. -You`re leaving?. -Yes. Alone?. Everything`s over. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Oh, uh, Mrs. Delbar... ...excuse my curiosity. But where do you go?. Home. On your way home, you pass Darwin Field?. Yes. You are stopping there maybe?. No, I think not. I think l`ll wait a while. Then someday, when everything gets straightened out... ...maybe Darwin Field will come to me. Goodbye. Goodbye. It`s your move now. Hello, give me Darwin Field. I want to talk to Major Thomas Milvaine. Where shall I stand?. Right inside the gate. And please, don`t forget to move your mouth and your arms. -Ready?. -Contact. -Hit it. DORSEY: Okay. [PLAYlNG "" PLEASE DON`T SAY NO""] Hoby, turn off the radio, dear. -Huh?. -The radio.
