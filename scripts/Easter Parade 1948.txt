I do. Wrap it up for the chap With a very happy Easter to you Never saw such a lovely day Happy Easter Everything seems to come your way Happy Easter My, oh, me, what a kick to be On the well-known avenue Me, oh, my, you're a lucky guy Happy Easter to you Happy Easter Happy Easter Happy Easter to you A bunny for my honey A dolly with a curl An aeroplane, an electric train And a teddy bear for my girl A kitty for my pretty A castle for my love Gee! What do I see? Brother, if that's a drum That's for me I'm drum crazy Yes, I'm drum crazy Yes, I'm plum crazy for drums I've got drumsticks full of hot licks And a roll Loaded with soul Under control First, soft violins Then sweet saxophones Then blue clarinets croon When it's my turn I turn into a loon When the drum takes the melody When the drum carries a tune Come on. Alley-oop. Now we go. - Happy Easter, Essie. - Oh, Mr. Hewes. Darling, where are you? - Don, I've been trying to call you. - Essie, will you help me, please? Thank you. Well, I got all tied up with an Easter rabbit. Hello, sweetheart. Here. Oh, I wish you hadn't. Haven't they come for your trunks? I told them to pick them up this morning. - They weren't ready. - We'll send them by pigeon. Here, try on your hat. We have time to walk in the parade before our train leaves. I don't wanna take that train. It's the last one that'll get us to Chicago in time for our opening. Look at that. This hat will wear the prettiest girl there. Don, I have to talk to you. Essie! - Take Michelle. - Come on, short hemline. I've had an offer for a show. Well, sure you have. I've had some myself. Yes, I know. Listen, baby, we're a team. We're playing the big time. See that? Nadine & Hewes? That's written in stardust. They've offered me a wonderful contract. They say they'll star me. And you can dance with anyone. Well, wait a minute. I suppose I could. I've danced with lots of girls. It's always been just a business. That was before I met you. This isn't just dancing. It's... It's different. This is... ...us. It only happens When I dance with you That trip to heaven Till the dance is through With no one else do the heavens Seem quite so near Why does it happen, dear Only with you? Two cheeks together Can be so divine But only when those cheeks Are yours and mine I've danced with dozens of others The whole night through But the thrill that comes with spring When anything could happen That only happens with you But the thrill that comes with spring When anything could happen It only happens I hope I'm intruding. Why, Professor, when did you get in? Just now. I had to make up an exam. - I've got the whole holiday before me. - Good. - Need any help celebrating? - Nadine. - Johnny. - I brought you something. Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny, what a darling. I know just the dress to wear him with. Essie. Essie! - Take your coat off. - Look what Mr. Harrow brought us. - Another one? - For my new beige suit. Who pushed you in the face? I want to give you a farewell tonight. Where will it be? Delmonico's? - Please sit down. - Sherry's? You decide, you're the party boy. Gosh, I wish you two weren't leaving. I'm not leaving. Oh, but, darling. I signed that contract, Don. - You what? - I signed it this afternoon. I'm going into a show, Johnny. Why, you're kidding. We've signed contracts for the next six months. You did. I didn't. There's no way they can hold me. I know it must sound terribly selfish of me, Don... ...but I've got to think of myself. After all, there's no future in my just being a ballroom dancer. You do understand, don't you? No. I'm sorry. I don't understand. - Don... - Johnny, you understand. Frankly, no. You can't be serious. It doesn't make sense. - I always thought you and Don were... - Did you? He's done everything in the world for you. Why walk out on him now? Johnny... ...don't you know? I think I'd better go and look for Don. We have a dinner date. - We'll be back. - But... - Can you drown a brunette in this? - How tall is she? Five-foot-six. - Try that. - Two bourbons, Mike. She's not going to Chicago. He travels fastest who travels alone, I always say. Right. I bet you know a lot about women. I should. I've been single all my life. - You're a smart fella... - Mike. Work behind a bar, you get to know what makes people tick. This place is like a clinic. People come in with their troubles. Well, if you listen, you learn. Been here 15 years, and I can boil down trouble into two classifications. - Yeah? What are they? - Women and their mothers. - Hello, Don. - Hi. Oh, hello, Professor. - What'll it be? Blond or brunette? - The same. Brunettes. They're the ones you got to watch. How did you find me? I didn't have my crystal ball, so I just followed you here. Meet my friend Mike. He's a disciple of Aristophanes. - How do you do? - Pleased to know you. Don, I'm taking you back to Nadine. Did she send you for me? - No, but... - That's the trouble with college. You've been reading. There's more sense in this than in a library. - Right, Mike? - Education's all right. It's the people who spoil it. Nadine didn't mean what she said. You two belong together. If she'd just fallen in love with some guy, I could do something about it. You know she can't get along without you, or you without her. Who says I can't get along without her? See those girls. Any one of them has as much talent as she. You're crazy. There's no one like Nadine. - Dances like an angel, knows how to dress... - I taught her. - I could take any of those girls... - Show's on. I could take any one of them and do the same. She still wouldn't be like Nadine. I promised I'd get right back. You coming? She knows where I am. She'll come around when contracts are out of season. You sure? No, thanks. You run along. All right. Take care of him, Mike. Okay. Any one of them. Do I need her? Well, no man is an island. - Thanks, Mike. - Every man is a piece of the continent... ...a part of the main. Sorry. Yeah, I think you'll do. - I'll do what? - I'm looking for someone to dance with. - Wrong number. - I need a new dancing partner. I'll give you $ 100 a week. A hundred doll... That would never do. - All right, $ 150. - A hundred and fifty. Thank you. Now may I go? Sure. Just a minute. Here's my card. I'll get a rehearsal hall at Michael's. Know where it is? Yeah. All right, tomorrow morning, 10:00. You'll wait for me. - Hi, Hannah. - Hi. Will you help me into this? - Sure. - Thank you. There's a nice guy. He's unhappy and a little lonely... I'll bet he's lonely. Got away from his keeper. You know what he wanted me to do? Give up a good, steady, $ 15-a-week job. - Thanks. - I didn't catch his name. Don Hewes. Don Hewes?! I was born in Michigan And I wish and wish again That I was back In the town where I was born There's a farm in Michigan And I'd like to fish again In the river that flows Beside the field of waving corn A lonesome soul am I Here's the reason why I want to go back I want to go back I want to go back to the farm Far away from harm With a milk pail on my arm I miss the rooster The one that used to Wake me up at 4 a.m. I think your great big city's Very pretty Nevertheless, I want to be there I want to see there A certain someone full of charm That's why I wish again That I was in Michigan Down on the farm I wanna go back I wanna go back I wanna go back To that old farm Far away from harm With a milk pail on my arm I miss the rooster The rooster that used to Wake me up at 4 a.m. I think your great big city's Very pretty Nevertheless, I want to be there I want to see there A certain someone full of charm That's why I wish again That I was in Michigan Down on The farm She's not coming. Come on, let's go. You said 10:00. She's only a minute late. She won't be here. At least I hope she won't. To tell the truth, I got emotional last night. I can't remember what happened, but I seem to have been carried away. Well, there goes five bucks. Here. It's worth ten to get out of it this easily. I'll see you later. Am I late? I'm sorry, Mr. Hewes. I couldn't catch a bus. It is Easter Sunday, you know. I walked. You should have seen Mr. Pastini's face when I quit my job last night. He was furious. Good morning. Say that again. - Good morning. - I mean about quitting your job. You... You told me to quit my job. You said... I know what I said. This is Marty. - How do you...? - Your name is? Hannah Brown. Oh, we can fix that. Sure, we can. Now, there's nothing to this. I lead for four counts, starting with your left. Half-turn to the right, drop to a curtsy as I bow. On five, rise slowly. Twist to the right, then to the left. Right arm fully extended in preparation for the first lift. I beg your pardon? You understand, don't you? No. Miss Brown, what idiot ever told you you were a dancer? You did. If I did, you're a dancer. Now, let's start this thing right from the beginning. Now, left foot forward, please. Left foot forward. You're gonna hate me. - I am? - Yes. You know your left foot from your right, don't you? - I'm never sure. - Oh, no. This isn't my fault. When I was little, I was left-handed. But the doctor told my mother I might grow up to be a dangerous criminal. So they made me do things with my right hand, and now I'm not sure anymore. How did you dance in the show? When I danced in the show, I had a garter on my left leg... ...but I haven't got a garter today. That is your left leg. That is your right leg. See? Yes. Here. - Here's a rubber band. Put that on. - Thank you. Did I say I got carried away? - Ready. - All right. Over here. Let's have some music. This is what you do. And... ...left, right, left, right. Turn right. Curtsy. And twist right. Twist left. Arm out. Lift, two, three, four. One, two, right, left, right. Good. One, two, three, four. Turn, two, three, four. Turn, two, three. Change. That's it. Now softer. Very quiet. Don't take your eyes from mine. You just look as if you're in pain. I am. The rubber band's too tight. - Well, then take it off. - It won't take me a minute. - I didn't know. It stopped the circulation. - Pick it up about here. Right there. - I know it's gonna be better now. - And, one, two, three, four. Now, look at me intimately, caressingly. Make every man in the audience wish that he were in my shoes. That's the idea. Closer. Closer. More. More. Lunch. Marty, about an hour I think will do, don't you? - Leave the music? - I've got the place all afternoon. - It won't make any difference. - Okay. Was I too terrible? No, no. You know, I've never really danced before. You're going to be fine. Mr. Hewes, you know, you don't have to go on with this. - Now, look... - I mean it. You're a wonderful dancer. You could get anybody to dance. You could get the best. I don't want the best. I want you. I mean, look. You didn't ask me for the job. I picked you. You're gonna make good. Not just for your sake, but for mine. It means a great deal to me. - It does? - Come on. Oh, look. The Easter Parade. Isn't it beautiful? It's all right, if you like Easter Parades. I can't believe I'm really here. I used to read about the Easter Parade in New York... - Excuse me. - In New York. And then I'd look at the pictures of the women in their lovely clothes... ...dream that maybe someday l... Here I am. Oh, look. May I take your picture, Miss Hale? Hold it, Miss Hale. Just one more, Miss Hale. - Good. Thank you. - Miss Hale. Thank you. Isn't she wonderful-looking! Even with that silly hat. - What's the matter with it? - She must be very important. Look at her clothes, the way she walks. See her nose? One year from now, you're gonna put it out of joint. - I am? - Next Easter, when we walk down here... ...you'll cause more excitement than an earthquake. Every photographer will break his neck to take your picture. One year from today, no one is gonna notice her when they look at you. - This is lovely. - That one. Yes, Mr. Hewes. May I see that, please? - Isn't this beautiful? - Wrap this up. Just send all the things. Yes, Mr. Hewes. - You ready? - Yes, Mr. Hewes. Mr. Hewes, I... These dresses are beautiful, but... - But what? - Do they look like me, like Hannah Brown? There is no more Hannah Brown. From now on, you're Juanita. If you wanted a Juanita, why did you pick me? Now, don't get mad. This is business. A girl dancer has to be exotic. She has to be... ...a peach. I suppose I'm a lemon. No. Here's what I mean. Now, when you walk down the street alone do men try to catch your eye? Of course they do. Do they turn around and look at you? L... I don't know. I never turn around to look at them. Here, give me those. You go ahead. I wanna try something. Just walk on ahead. I wanna see. Right! You've got it. Thank you. Let go of my hand. Let go of my hand. Left. - I'm afraid... - Don't worry. - It was just the first performance. - I was so nervous. One thing you mustn't do: Get a stranglehold on me. It pulls me off balance. - I know. - Relax, you'll be all right. I hope so. Did you send these? - Yes. - They're very beautiful. - You go change, we'll have dinner. - May I bring my roses? Sure. - Keep sending flowers. It's good business. - Yes, sir. How did the act go, Mr. Hewes? One bow. Too bad. Eddie. Eddie. Eddie, get down there. Sit. Sit. All right, everybody sit down. Sit down. Tomorrow we'd better get some dogs in the act. - Here's the young lady. - Nadine. Darling, I was so excited when I got your message. - When did you get in town? - I got in this morning. I can recommend fillet of sole meuniere. - Monsieur had that last night. - Last night? - We'll order later. - Very well. I'll remove this. We're expecting someone else. - Luncheon for three? - Who's joining us? Someone who's very important to both of us. Johnny, I'm going to meet your father. Look, Nadine, our future is so far away. I have years of school ahead of me... I thought you were almost finished with law school. I am, I am. But I've decided to become a doctor. I'll wait. Well, it's liable to be a tough struggle. I won't inherit any of my father's money until I'm at least... ...fifty-five. - Fifty-five? That's an odd arrangement. Well, Father was very eccentric. He hated children. Oh, I love children. Maybe you could adopt one. - There he is. - Hello, Johnny. Donald. If you'll forgive me, I have an oral psychology exam. You what? You'll flunk it. Hello, Nadine. I'm glad you're here, Don. Sit down, won't you? - Thanks. - I've been wanting to talk to you. You have? You look tired. Breaking in new routines. You remember it. It seems years ago. I can tell you how many minutes it's been. Is the gentleman coming back? Yes, but not for lunch. Luncheon for two? We have some very fine broiled lamb chops today. We'll order later. Thank you. Very good, monsieur. It's... ...very nice to see you. I've been hearing about your new act. It's not really broken in yet. It seems so strange dancing with somebody else. Remember our opening night in Boston? Three encores, eight bows. We stopped the show cold. I still have those reviews. - Listen, baby, I was thinking... - I start rehearsal soon for my new show. Are you going through with that crazy idea? Crazy? Because I don't wanna spend the rest of my life being a common hoofer? It was good enough when I took you out of that chorus. You think if it hadn't been for you, I'd still be there? That's possible. The fellow who ran that place wasn't Ziegfeld. Let me tell you something. If you can get along without me... ...tell that seamstress dancing with you to stop imitating me. Imitating you? She's never even seen you. No, but you have. All my friends are laughing. - That's it. - You bet that's it. - And you tell that Miss... - Brown. Hannah Brown. - I have something to do. - Don't you dare leave me alone. You forget, honey. You're on your own now. The gentleman is coming back? You're wrong twice. Luncheon for one? May I suggest the sirloin tips to mademoiselle? Thank you. I'm not hungry. Certainly, mademoiselle. Come in again soon. Bring your friends. How much is that, please? Let's see. Roast beef, pie, milk. That'll be 15 cents. - Thank you. - Thank you. Bye. Goodbye. You can't trust those weathermen. They said rain today. If they'd said sunshine, I would've worn my raincoat. Oh, I'm terribly... ...sorry. That's all right. I think we can straighten up now. Raining, huh? Yes. I wish it'd stop. I've got an appointment. Nobody would expect you to be on time in this weather. He will. - Lf I were you, I'd divorce him. - He's not my husband. - Oh, then I wouldn't marry him. - No, no, this is business. - Well, I think it's letting up... - Oh, no, no. It's still raining very hard. You know, I bet you like to walk in the rain. - Yes, I do, but... - But home, in the country. - Yes. - In the woods, in the spring? - But you wouldn't be wearing that hat. - I really must go. Oh, no, no. You can't go out in that. - It's an epidemic. - What? - Pneumonia. - What? - I'll get you a cab. - Don't get me one. - I've only got two blocks to go. You can't... - No. Don't move. In two minutes, you've managed to find out that I'm not married or engaged. That I'm from the country, and meeting a man on business. It wasn't bad, was it? Yeah, but you haven't told me a thing about yourself. I'm just a fella A fella with an umbrella Looking for a girl Who saved her love for a rainy day I'm just a fella A fella with an umbrella Glad to see the skies of blue Have turned into skies of gray Raindrops have brought us together And that's what I long to see Maybe the break in the weather Will prove to be A break for me So I'll be the fella The fella with an umbrella If you'll be the girl Who saved her love For a rainy day For every fella Each fella with an umbrella There's a girl A girl who saved her love for a rainy day For every fella Each fella with an umbrella There's a time when skies of blue Must turn into skies of gray Raindrops have brought us together That's what they were meant to do Maybe the break in the weather Will turn into A break for you And I'll help the fella The fella with an umbrella Help him find the girl Who saved her love For a rainy day One of the first rules of this business is to be punctual. - You're a half-hour late. - I'm sorry. - All right. - I got caught in the... I said, all right. I have something important to talk about. I found out what's wrong with our act. - You did? - Yes. You've been trying to be somebody else. I've been trying to what? - Look at you. - What's the matter? - That dress. - I've tried to explain... - That hat. - I knew I wouldn't look good. - The way you move in the numbers. - You told me to move like that. All right. I've changed my mind. - From now on, you're gonna be yourself. - I am? You'll start from the beginning. There'll be no more fancy dresses. There is no more Juanita. From now on, you're just plain Hannah Brown. Whatever you say. - Do you know this song? - Yes. - I'd like to hear you sing it, please. - All right. Get over there where I can see you, please. I love the piano I love the piano I love to hear somebody play Upon a piano A grand piano It simply carries me away I know a fine way To treat a Steinway I love to run my fingers o'er the keys The ivories And with the pedal I love to meddle When Paderewski comes this way I'm so delighted If I'm invited To hear the longhaired genius play So you can keep your fiddle And your bow Give me a P-l-A-N-O Oh, oh! I love to stop right Beside an upright Or a high-toned baby grand Oh, that's wonderful! - Is it? - Wonderful. Great. - Do you know this? - Yes, I know it. Good girl! Cross. That's fine. Now around. Oh, yes! I love to stop right Beside an upright Or a high-toned baby grand All night long he calls her "snookey ookums" Snookey ookums All they do is talk like babies She's his "jelly-elly roll" He's her "sugey-ugar bowl" Here's the way they bill and coo "Poogywoo," poogywoo Poogywoo All night long he calls her "snookey ookums" Snookey ookums All night long the neighbors shout "Cut it out," "Cut it out" "Cut it out!" They cry, "For goodness sake Don't keep us all awake With your snookey-ookey-ookey Baby talk" Fiddle up, fiddle up On your violin Lay right on it Rest your chin upon it Doggone, you better begin And play an overture upon your violin Hurry up, hurry up With your violin Make it sooner Don't you stop to tune her Fid, fid, fid, fiddle the middle Of your ragtime violin When the midnight choo-choo Leaves for Alabam' Alabam', Alabam' - I'll be right there - Where'll you be? - I've got my fare - Show it to me When I see that rusty-haired Conductor man What'll you do? I'll grab him by the collar And I'll holler "Alabam'! Alabam'!" That's where you stop your train That brings me back again Down home where I'll remain Where my honey lamb Am I will be right there with bells When that old conductor yells "All aboard, all aboard All aboard for Alabam'!" I will be right there with bells When that old conductor yells "All aboard All aboard All aboard for Alabam'!" Stop it! Stop it! They'll be asking Mr. Ziegfeld for more money. Good news, Don. He liked the act and he wants to see you right away. - Thanks, Al. - That was charming. Don, isn't that the girl we saw in the Easter Parade? You know, the one with that hat? - There's no need to introduce you two. - Hello, Don. - Hello, Nadine. - How nice to have you in my show. - Your show? - This is Miss Brown. - Nadine Hale, star of our show. - How do you do? I've been looking forward to meeting you. Don and I have talked about you. - Don and you...? - Harry, we'll do Miss Hale's number. Excuse me. Harry, I think I'll need four extra bars on my intro in order to get... Is that the Nadine you used to dance with? Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? - Well, I never thought about it. - Were you in love? - What? - Were you in love with her? - Well, we... - Never mind. - Hannah, look... - Don, Mr. Ziegfeld's waiting upstairs. I'll meet you at the hotel. Taxi. Taxi. Hello, there! - Oh, hello. - Where have you been? I've been living in that drugstore waiting for you. - How are you? - Fine. How are you? Fine. - Gosh, it's good to see you again. - It's good to see you too. This brilliant conversation's costing you money. Yes. I must go anyway. - What are you doing here? - We just auditioned for the show. Have you ever heard of Hannah & Hewes? Hannah & Hewes? Don't tell me you're Hannah Brown. - Don't tell me you've ever heard of me. - Of course I have, from Don. - Do you know Don? - Do I know him? We're like brothers. - Hey. - Oh, I'm sorry. Well, I have to... Wait a minute, now. I'm not gonna lose you again. - Have dinner with me tonight? - I don't think... It ain't worth it, lady. - I'm almost one of the family. - All right. - I'll fix it with Don. - Fine. - Where are you staying? - Regency Park Hotel. - Regency Park Hotel. - I'll pick you up at 7:30. - Bye. - Bye. Officer, I thank you. - Hello. - Hello. Well... ...what did he say? When do we start? We don't. We turned it down. Turned it down? But, Don, l... I don't understand. This is everything we've worked for. It's everything you've dreamed of. Come here. Sit down. Now, look, there are all kinds of dreams. Some people dream about a little farm to settle down on... ...a spot all their own. That's what we want... ...only our spot's on a marquee. "Hannah & Hewes" in blazing lights. It's got to be all ours. We're not sharing it. Besides, Nadine doesn't belong in the same show with you! She can't compare to you! She can't? No. Professor! How did you know I was here? - Well... - This is wonderful. Come on in. Hannah, this is the greatest guy. Johnny Harrow, Hannah Brown. - Hello. - Hello. - Won't you sit down. - Thank you. - What are you doing tonight? - Well, I had plans... Cancel. Dine with us. I'll make a reservation. We won't take no for an answer, will we, Hannah? - Wanna get yourself a date? - Well, I have a date, I think. - Fine. Bring her along. - Thanks. I will. - Those are lovely. - Oh, they're for you. Thank you, Johnny. It won't take me a minute. I'll get dressed. Don, you're welcome to join us... ...if you'd like to. There's no point in your wasting those flowers on me. Look, tell Hannah I'll see her tomorrow. - So long, Johnny. - Goodbye, Don. - Don said he'd see you tomorrow. - Thank you. Johnny, could we go someplace where we can talk? Yes, I know just the place. - Thank you. - You don't want to order. Yes, we do. The specialty tonight is beef stroganoff. - But you wouldn't like it. - It sounds wonderful. - Make it two. - Two beef stroganoffs. - Yes. What about a salad? - Salad? There is only one salad. Salad Franois. - Your salad? - Let's try it. - Try it? - What's in it? I'll show you. This salad has been handed down... ...from my great-grandfather to my grandfather... ...to my father, and from my father to me. Spice... ...from India. Herb from Africa. Garlic... ...perfume for a gourmet. I gently rub the inside of the bowl. Petits pois from France. Apartment 24B. Egg... ...from a chicken. Lemon. You must be ruthless. Cheese, Parmesan from Italy. I put them in anyway. Onion from Bermuda. You slice the onion very thin. This gives the salad flavor. It makes it bright, refreshing... ...and gay. Mix, mix, toss, toss. Mix, mix, toss, toss. Toss, toss, mix, mix. Toss, toss, mix, mix. Mix, toss, toss, mix. Mix, mix, toss, toss. I don't think so. It's very nice here. I like it. Now, what did you wanna talk to me about? You and Don are very good friends, aren't you? Yes. - Was he ever married? - No. Engaged? I only ask because I'm curious. He never talks about himself. Just about dancing. - Everything is strictly business. - That's a good idea. Sometimes... ...if we make a mistake in the show, he'll ask if I'll stay... ...and rehearse with him. We go out and have a late supper... ...and we dance... ...just the two of us. Sometimes I make mistakes on purpose. You know, I think that Franois was right, there are three of us here. Look... ...supposing Don were interested in someone else? Do you mean Nadine? Well, they used to work together. - He was in love with her, wasn't he? - I don't know. I guess so. Well, he isn't anymore. He turned down the Ziegfeld show. Why? Because he said that she didn't belong in the same show with me. I agree with him. Now, is there anything more that I can tell you about Don? No. Good. Now let's talk about us. Did you know that scientists say that people fall in love quickest during a rainstorm? I can prove that. Because that's when I fell in love with you. You're not angry? Angry? No, I'm not angry. I'm very proud. Do you think that... ...you could love me? Oh, Johnny, I'd be such a fool if I didn't. But... ...l'm in love with Don. Are you sure? And it's... It's nothing like I thought it was going to be. It never is. You know, l... I used to dream that... ...when I'd fall in love with a man... ...he'd send me flowers... ...sweep me off my feet, take me in his arms. It's nothing like that with Don. He doesn't even know I'm alive, half the time. When he sweeps me off my feet... ...it's during a dance number. When he sends me flowers... ...it's because it's good for business. Oh, he's taken me in his arms... ...but there've never been less than 700 people watching. Oh, it's not his fault. It's mine. When they were passing out the wishes... ...I wished for him. Our dinner should be ready soon. I'm not very hungry. Neither am I. Should we go? Yeah. We're not staying. - You're not? - No. Your hat and coat, Mr. Harrow. There's an old superstition Way down South Everybody believes That trouble won't stay If you shake it away When they hold a revival Way down South Everybody with care And trouble that day Tries to shake it away Shakin' the blues away Unhappy news away If you are blue, it's easy to Shake off your cares and troubles Tellin' the blues to go They may refuse to go But as a rule, they'll go if you'll Shake 'em away Do like the voodoos do Listenin' to A voodoo melody They shake their bodies so To and fro With every shake A lucky break Provin' that there's a way To chase your cares away If you would lose your weary blues Shake 'em away Shake 'em away Shakin' the blues away Unhappy news away If you are blue, it's easy to Shake off your Shake off your cares And shake off your troubles Show them that there's a way To chase your cares away If you would lose your weary blues Shake 'em away Shake 'em away Away Away Hello? Hannah. Now, don't tell me you're gonna break our date. Johnny, have you heard from Don? I haven't seen him since yesterday. I've been calling everyplace. No. I wouldn't worry. Nothing could've happened. You don't know how depressed he's been the past few weeks. Then today, with the papers saying what a big hit the Follies is. You know, he turned it down, and... I don't know. I'm so worried about him. Oh, wait a minute, Johnny. Will you hold the line? There's somebody at the door. - Hello, baby! - Don! - Where've you been? You read the reviews? - Sure. Very good. - But wait till you read ours, baby. - Ours?! - Dillingham wants us for a show. - Dillingham?! Yeah! He called me this morning. I've been with him all day. - He wants to build a show around us. - Oh, Don! - Where's a calendar? A calendar! - A calendar? A calendar! Here! Here! - Here's one. - Yeah. Move over. Now, everything's all set. We start a week from Monday. Four weeks' rehearsal. Four on the road, Philadelphia, Boston. Opening in New York April 6th. Oh, Don, look! April 7th. What about it? Easter. We'll be here for the Easter Parade. - That's right. We have a date, haven't we? - Yes. - Say, how about celebrating tonight? - Wonderful. - Go out and do the town. - I'd love it! I better meet with the writers. Pick me up, huh? - Right. - Good. Eight o'clock. - Sharp. - Sharp. Bye. Johnny, are you still there? I'm sorry. Yes, I'm still here. Congratulations. Did you hear? Isn't it wonderful? Yes, it's great. I hope you don't mind if I break our date for tonight. Oh, Johnny. That's all right. We'll celebrate tomorrow night. Thank you, Johnny. Bye. Operator. Plaza 3-1549. Hello, Nadine? Nadine, I'll be able to make it for dinner tonight after all. Right. - Hello. - I hope I'm not late. - You're right on time. - Aren't we going out? I thought if you didn't mind, we'd have dinner here. - I'd love it. - Good. Champagne? Yeah. There won't be anybody to disturb us, just the two of us. I thought we'd go over some new ideas I have for the show. - There's one in particular I know... - What?! What's the matter? What have I done? Nothing, that's what you've done. Nothing. I thought we had a date tonight, not a rehearsal. I should know better than to expect you to be human. - You're just a pair of dance shoes. - What? I'm tired of being a prop here! - I don't even feel like a girl! - Listen... - You're just a pair of dancing shoes! - You said that. I don't care! Besides, I bought a new dress! - It's pretty. - You haven't even looked. - That's not true. - Oh, isn't it? All right, then tell me: What color are my eyes? You won't be able to answer that because you have never paid enough attention to it. They're brown. That's right. - I'll get my hat and coat... - Oh, no, please. Can't we stay here? - But you said... - I know, but... ...that was before. I don't mind now. All right. Fire is so pretty. "It Only Happens When I Dance With You." That's one of the old songs. She's very beautiful. Yes, but she doesn't mean anything to me anymore. I told her I could teach any girl to dance as well as she. And you have. No. We have. The idea was just this. I started out to prove something, and now it isn't important anymore. That's all. It only happens When I dance with you That trip to heaven Till the dance is through With no one else Do the heavens seem quite so near Why does it happen, dear Only with you? Two cheeks together Can be so divine But only when those cheeks Are yours and mine I've danced with dozens of others The whole night through But the thrill that comes with spring When anything could happen That only happens With you Why didn't you tell me I was in love with you? Come in. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? Thanks for the flowers. - Nervous? - No. Don't do that! Don't put your hat on the bed. It's bad luck. - I'm sorry. - That's all right. - Come in. - Fifteen minutes, Miss Brown. Oh, I feel like I'm going to my execution. Don't worry. They love you. That's unanimous. Come in. - Hello, Don. - Hi, John. I'll go start leading the applause. Good luck. - Thanks, John. - Don, can you die from fright? You'll be all right once you get on-stage. I better go get dressed. Good luck. - Thank you. - Don't forget to watch my number... ...with all those beautiful girls. This is my left leg. This is my right. This is my... Anna? Anna, my garter. - Garter? - The garter for me. Where is it? The garter. Here he comes Looking for his baby It's for sure Sure and not for maybe Don't ask when will the lucky day be Here he comes And let him tell you himself If I seem to scintillate It's because I've got a date A date with a package of The good things that come with love You don't have to ask me I won't waste your time But if you should ask me Why I feel sublime I'm steppin' out with my baby Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right It's for sure, not for maybe That I'm all dressed up tonight Steppin' out with my honey Can't be bad to feel so good Never felt quite so sunny And I keep on knockin' wood There'll be smooth sailin' 'Cause I'm trimmin' my sails With a bright shine on my shoes And on my nails Steppin' out with my baby Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right Ask me when will the day be The big day may be tonight Steppin' out with my baby Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right It's for sure, not for maybe That I'm all dressed up tonight Steppin' out with my honey Can't be bad to feel so good Never felt quite so sunny And I keep on knockin' wood There'll be smooth sailin' 'Cause I'm trimmin' my sails With a bright shine on my shoes And on my nails Steppin' out with my baby Can't go wrong, 'cause I'm in right Ask me when will the day be The big day may be tonight This is Essie, Miss Hale. Mr. Hewes just did a number with a lot of girls. I tell you, Miss Hale, any one of those girls is better than she is. How was Mr. Hewes? He was all right, but not like he used to be when he danced with you. That's fine. Come on back now. I can't find a thing. I'd better stay for the next number. I'll be right back after that. We're a couple of swells We stop at the best hotels But we prefer the country Far away from the city smells We're a couple of sports The pride of the tennis courts In June, July and August We look cute when we're dressed in shorts The Vanderbilts have asked us Up for tea We don't know how to get there No, sirree No, sirree We would drive up the avenue But we haven't got the price We would skate up the avenue But there isn't any ice We would ride on a bicycle But we haven't got a bike So we'll walk up the avenue Yes, we'll walk up the avenue And to walk up the avenue's What we like Wall Street bankers are we With plenty of currency We'd open up the safe But we forgot where we put the key We're the favorite lads Of girls in the picture ads We'd like to tell you Who we kissed last night But we can't be cads The Vanderbilts are waiting At the club But how are we to get there? That's the rub That's the rub We would sail up the avenue But we haven't got a yacht We would drive up the avenue But the horse we had was shot We would ride on a trolley car But we haven't got the fare So we'll walk up the avenue Yes, we'll walk up the avenue Yes, we'll walk up the avenue Till we're there We would swim up the avenue But we haven't any lake So we'll walk up the avenue Yes, we'll walk up the avenue Yes, a walk up the avenue's What we'll take - Mind if I say I told you so? - Johnny, I'm so happy. - Miss Brown, you were magnificent. - Thank you. - You were wonderful. - Thank you. - I'll call you tomorrow. - All right. - Hello, Johnny. - Hello. - Hello. - Great show, Johnny. - Don. - Yeah? - Just wonderful, really. - Thanks. I'm taking Hannah to celebrate. Come. I'm going to the roof to see Nadine. - Oh, fine. - Come in. Come in. - Don, you know where I'd like to go? - Where? To Pastini's, where we met. Sure, but some other night. I made reservations for the Ziegfeld Follies. - We gotta celebrate. - All right. - Good night, Anna. - Good night. Good night. And there she was, all dirtied up, and with a man's clothes on. When they danced together, they laughed at her. It was just awful. Come in. - Good evening, Nadine. - Oh, hello. Well, Essie, I see you got here before me. I suppose you won't believe me, Johnny, but I'm sorry for her. Really sorry. What? Essie was telling me about their show tonight. Oh, you were? - On-stage, Miss Hale. - Oh, coming. Essie, don't forget my slippers. I'm flattered you came tonight, Johnny. I wasn't sure you could tear yourself away. Oh, dear, I wish they'd stop. They won't until we take a bow. Come on. - Who's getting the hand? - Hannah & Hewes. - What?! - They made a big hit in that show tonight. I still say she doesn't compare to you. The girl I love Is on a magazine cover It seems they painted her Just for me I'd fall in love If I could ever discover A little girl quite as nice as she If I could meet A girl as sweet I'd simply claim her And name her my queen For if she ever came I would love her the same As I love her On the cover Of a magazine If I could meet A girl as sweet I'd simply claim her And name her my queen For if she ever came I would love her the same As I love her On the cover Of a magazine On the cover Of a magazine Here, take this. I'm not through yet. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. My former partner, Mr. Don Hewes, is here this evening. And perhaps we can persuade Mr. Hewes to do one of our old numbers: "It Only Happens When I Dance With You." Oh, no. Please, Don. - What time does the last show start? - This isn't an all-night joint... Hannah. Hello, Mike. Gosh, it's good to see you. If I knew you were coming, I'd have cleaned the place up. Oh, no, it's never looked so wonderful. - Gosh, you look pretty. - Hello, Joe. - Hello, Hannah. - Been reading all about you. How does it feel to be a big success? Fine. - How are things with you, Mike? - Oh, always the same. Problem with every drink. People's troubles never change. - Don't they? - No. They always come in... ...whenever they've got... How about some champagne? No, thanks. I don't think so. Well, I'm gonna celebrate your opening night. - Cheers. - Cheers. This is your opening night, isn't it? Well, what are you doing here by yourself? Oh, I don't know. I just... ...wanted to get away for a while. Sure. If there's anything I can do, break anyone's neck, just say the word. No, thanks, Mike. There isn't anything anyone can do. Don't say that. No man is that important. Plenty of fish left in the sea. - You know, it's always darkest... - Oh, Mike, please. I don't think you've got a motto for what my kind of trouble is. Maybe not. Maybe not. But I've got a poem. For ev'ry rose that withers and dies, Another blooms in its stead A new love waits to open its eyes After the old love is dead That sounds all right In a careless rhyme But there's seldom A second time Better luck next time That could never be Because there ain't gonna be No next time For me No, sirree Made up my mind To make another start I've made my mind up But I can't make up my heart I'd like a new lucky day That would be nice But this comes Just once in a lifetime Not twice So don't say "Better luck next time" That can never be Because there ain't gonna be No next time For me Good evening, Miss Brown. Congratulations. Thank you. - Any messages? - No. - Good night. - Good night. Hannah. I was beginning to think you were never coming. If I knew you'd be here, you'd be right. - Oh, listen. - You're lost. This isn't the Ziegfeld roof. Why did you run off without letting me explain? You don't have to explain. This is after working hours. - I had to dance with Nadine. - You made that very obvious. You couldn't wait, could you? Was it fun watching me make a fool of myself all those months of rehearsal? I was willing to do anything to make good, but I thought it was for us. - But it was. - No. The whole thing was a buildup... ...to get Nadine back. Well, now you've got her. Excuse me. You're wrong. I don't want her. I want you. Depends on what song is being played. - Would you listen to me? - I'm sick of listening to you. I'm sick of you using my life for a checkerboard. I've had enough. Now go on back to Nadine and her Russian wolfhounds. Tell her the experiment worked. You can dance with anybody. Good night. Hannah... ...even a murderer is innocent until he's proved guilty. All right, I told you I did start this thing to get Nadine back. I was sore when she walked out. I wanted to show her I didn't need her. Well, I found out I don't. I didn't know that until I met you. How was I to know that you'd be the most wonderful... ...girl in the whole world? Hannah, will you please open the door just for a minute? I'm gonna stay right here until you do, if it takes all night. Baby? Baby? - Oh, hello. - Well, it's nice to see you too. Did you come alone? Certainly. Well, do you mind if I come in? Oh, I'm sorry. Please do. I thought maybe Don might... We had a little misunderstanding. I know. I stayed over at his place last night. I haven't slept all night. Didn't close my eyes. - How's he? - I don't know. - He was still asleep when I left. - Asleep? You mean he wasn't upset? Oh, a little. It's always a nuisance auditioning a new partner. Auditioning?! He can't do that to me! - Why not? - Because he loves me, that's why not! He's under the impression that you weren't fond of him. But I am. Terribly. - I'm afraid it's a little late. - Late? That can't be. What'll I do? Well, if I loved someone, I'd find a way to let them know it. Well, it's different with a man. - Why? - I don't know. It just is, that's all. It's easier. They can... Johnny. Johnny. Put on his favorite dress. You'll be late for the Easter Parade. Do something about your face. You look horrible. Oh, Johnny, thank you. Thank you. Hello, operator. Plaza 3-1598, please. Hello, Nadine? Nadine, get out all the hounds. We're going for a walk. Mr. Hewes' apartment? Sam, where'd you put my...? - What's that? - These just arrived. - Who are they for? - For you. For me? Well, they couldn't be. Sam, well, don't put them down there. - Go catch the fella... - No card. There must be some mistake. Find out where they belong, will you, Sam? - They're very pretty. - For you. - For me? Well, who brought them? - A messenger. Put them down, will you? Sam, do you know anything about this? You think we dare open it? "Happy Easter, darling." There must be some mistake. He got the wrong apartment. - Shall I open the other one? - No, I'll open it. What a cute little rabbit. Hello, little fella. Hello, there. Isn't he cute? Aren't you hungry? Where did you come from? Bunny want a cracker? I'll get it. - Hello, Sam. - Oh, hello, Miss Brown. - Meet bunny. - We're old friends. Happy Easter. - Happy Easter. - Thank you. - Did you...? - Aren't you ready yet? - Just like a man. Will you get his jacket? - I'll get it. - You're gonna be late. - Late? For the Easter Parade. We had a date, remember? Here, let's look. Oh, very nice. Never saw you look Quite so pretty before Never saw you dress Quite so handsome, what's more I could hardly wait to keep our date This lovely Easter morning And my heart beat fast As I came through the door For In your Easter bonnet With all the frills upon it You'll be the grandest fella In the Easter Parade I'll be all in clover And when they look us over We'll be the proudest couple In the Easter Parade On the avenue Fifth Avenue The photographers will snap us And you'll find that you're In the rotogravure Oh, I could write a sonnet About your Easter bonnet And of the guy I'm taking To the Easter Parade On the avenue Fifth Avenue The photographers will snap us And you'll find that you're In the rotogravure Oh, I could write a sonnet About your Easter bonnet And of the girl I'm taking To the Easter Parade
