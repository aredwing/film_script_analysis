I deal in natural remedies, not mystical. Really? I was told a witch named Thorne travels the countryside, seeking out young women for their magical abilities, selling their whereabouts to the coven of the crescent moon. Now, if this were to be true, I might know where to find a young woman with such a gift. You seem to know much about me, yet I know nothing about you. Forgive me. You are the witchslayer. I've heard things about you as well. And I assure you, all of them true. I told you she was a witch. Somebody has been sharing our secret. -What do you want from me? -The coven. The queen will kill me if I betray her. I will kill you if you don't. I am many things, patient is not among them. I don't know where the coven is, it finds me. Not the answer I was looking for. Wait, wait, wait! I know where its Warlock will be tonight. He intends to bind a girl into their order. It's the village to the south, the blacksmith's daughter. She's unaware of her gift. For this information, I will let you live, witch. However, I cannot speak for Lara. She mentioned a Warlock. Warlocks are a rare breed. As many witches as I have slain, I've yet to hear of a queen ruling a coven. This witch's coven must be powerful. -Let's find out. -Okay. Your skill rivals my own. You're a good teacher. You're my favorite student. I'm your only student. That's why you'll always be my favorite. -Let's eat. -Yes. Soon you'll be able to take over, Wm my Father. Where is that boy you like? Haven't seen him lately. -What is it? -Someone's out there. - Don't. - Who's there? Who are you? What do you want? Father! No! No! No! Father! Hello, my dear. My name is Abyss. I know you are frightened, but don't worry. We'll become very well acquainted, as you learn to serve my queen. She's powerful. No! No! -Ehren! -No! -We are going to bind you. -What do you mean, bind me? What is this? Let me go. Let me go! Please, let me go! What is this? Let me go! No! Let me go! What is this? Let me go! What do you want? What do... No! No! Let me go! Let me go! Is everything prepared? Let me go! No, don't! Please, don't! Please, don't. Please. This will all be over shortly, my dear. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go! You have no idea the trouble you are in. Where are you? No, don't. Please. Wait. - I won't hurt you. - What are you? A witchslayer. Father! Father! I rescued the girl. Really? Well done. She's on her way back to the village. Her father is dead. But it doesn't look like the work of a witch. What, then? I'm not sure yet. I managed to kill two of the coven. - And the Warlock? - Still out there. No. No. Stay away! I didn't mean to frighten you. I'm not your enemy. My name is Lara. I just want to help you. Try to. - Go away. - I'm so sorry. I just want to help you make sense. May I help you bury him? I don't want your help! No! Father! Let him go! Lara! The girl's sleeping. And I found this. - What is it? - It's a scale from a gargoyle. The witch's familiar. And only a powerful witch could conjure a familiar. We need to move. What do we do about her? Her magic is strong. I can sense it. - We should kill her. - She's an innocent. Not if she has magic. You spared her from the binding. Her magic is still pure. If I could train her to use it properly... -No, Lara. -It takes magic to fight magic. If I convince her to travel with us, then at least she stands a fighting chance. She'll prove to be either warrior or bait. All right. But the first sign of trouble, I will slay her. For once, for now, have faith. She's lost much, as much as you or I. Please. Fine. But the first sign of trouble... We are going to get lost, brother. Don't worry, I'm marking our trail. This is far enough. I want to go home now. All right. This way. What's wrong? We're lost. I promise. I'm coming. I promise. Let me. Yeah. What did they want with me? They intended to use a binding spell on you. It's designed to enslave both your mind and your magic to their coven. Magic? My magic? I'm sure if you think on it, there have been signs. Moments in your life that defied logical explanation. You may have met someone and been able to tell what they were thinking without them having said a word aloud. Someone angered you and through no conscious act of your own, they were hurt. The gift flows strongly through you. I can feel it. Prove it. I was hoping you would say that. In my hand, this sphere sits motionless. I want you to take it from me. Keep your fist wrapped firmly around it until I say otherwise. I need you to trust me. Take it. Now open your hand. This sphere is reacting to your instinct of magic. I can't! Believe me when I say it is better to have magic than to not. Are you a witch? Or are you a witchslayer? A little of both. It's very important that you learn how to use your powers so that they are only ever used for good. Ehren, you have nothing left here. It would be safer if you traveled with us. If you remain, think, they'll find you and they'll turn your powers against you. Do you intend to hunt the Warlock that killed my father? Not only him, but his queen and the entire coven. I'm coming with you. You failed to acquire the girl. She was rescued by the witchslayer. He killed two of the coven. Why is the slayer's head not befor me on a pike? He has weapons we have never seen before. Something more troubling is, my magic was useless against him. I had no choice but to flee. The girl you lost is the only one suitable for my host. This body is failing me quickly. You must reclaim her. And the witchslayer? Bring him to me alive. Alive? Yes, I believe he and I have history. And, Warlock, take my pet. Do you question my order? The familiar is unneeded. I did not ask for your opinion. You will do what I tell you when I tell you. Yes, Mistress. Don't worry, she will not kill you. Unless I tell her to. The quicker you learn to control your power, the better. We don't have much time. Focus. See in your mind's eye. Trust. Know with magic that all things are possible. Understand, everything in our world starts with an idea. The grasp of this concept is key. Are you saying I can think something into happening? You can conjure things straight from your imagination into form. It's the same energy that you use to move your arm. And you can extend that energy outside of yourself onto other things, onto people... It can be a wonder or a weapon. I want to try something. Okay. Concentrate. I want you to focus. Hmm m g See it in your mind. And then make it so. Yes. Outstanding. Now unleash it. -See? -Yeah. We head west. She needs to better understand her powers if she is to be helpful to us. She'll learn as we go. Lest you forget, we are hunting witches, not training them. How can you be sure? Each X marks a kill. If you look to the west, you'll notice no )('s. No kills yet. And there lies the coven. If we want to destroy this witch, we need to strike her at her heart. Therefore, we need to move. Where are we going? West. You ready? I should thank you. - I owe you my life. - You owe me nothing. Any excuse to kill witches. Did I do something to anger you? Not yet. If I do, please keep it to yourself. Forgive him, Ehren. You're the first witch he's encountered, well, since he found me, that he hasn't killed. Conspiring with the enemy. I conspire with anyone who helps serv my cause. Do you intend to hunt me once we destroy this coven? You're not a true witch yet. All I wish to do is avenge my father's death. Then we should get along just fine. Something's not right. I can feel it. You hold here. I'm going to scout ahead. See what we're getting into. - Be careful. - I always am. - Where is she going? - Lara has a sixth sense for danger. It's kept us out of trouble on more than one occasion. - Should we follow her? - She'll be fine. Trust me. Let's use this time to teach you something useful. Follow me. Hello, my dear. -Defiant bunch, are we? -Let her go! Let her go! Stop it now! Run, run! No, no. Kill them. No! Where is the girl and the witchslayer? I believe I found you suitable host, my mistree. Come closer, dear. She has no power. Crystal arrows are our best weapon. Difficult for the witches to shield against. Most effective when you strike the heart. That's their power source. A direct hit, and they'll be destroyed by their own magic. You miss your mark and only wound, they'll be on you in a flash. Don't worry. I'm no shrinking violet. Impressive. You have failed me again. Find the girl that you lost. She is the only one whose magic is strong enough. She may be dead. For your sake, hope she lives. There is no need to threaten me. I don't threaten, I act. Be mindful of your place, Abyss. You live and breathe to serve me. It would almost seem as if you are trying to fail me. I would rather see the coven destroyed than its power in your hands. Do you understand, Warlock? Yes, Mistress. Then get out of my sight. And don't come back until you have the girl. And remember, don't lie to me. I'll know. My pet sees all. My father used to say, "if you want to make weapons, "you need to know how to use them." Your father was a smart man. I can see your father taught you well. No. My father died when I was very young. Learned my skills much later in life. Why? My story is no different than yours. -Who did you lose to them? -A sister. - Tell me more. - Perhaps another time. How come you know so much about killing witches? I learned much on my own, and then I found Lara. She was part of a coven. - So she is a witch. - No longer. Something happened that broke the binding spell. She was near death when I found her. She remembers nothing of life, but everything of witchcraft. Every potion, every spell. She has no power. Her knowledge is priceless and so is she. Lara created our entire arsenal. Here. Armor, lightweight, tough. The witches we encounter will have weapons. These will allow us to communicate over great distances. And this delivers a charge like a lightning bolt. Extremely painful. Hinders their magic. You. -You used this on the warlock. -Yes. I never encountered a Warlock before. Very powerful. Never seen anyone jump so fast. Makes him difficult to kill? Difficult, yes. But impossible, no. And these allow us to see the glow of a witch, even when they cloak. Come quickly. There's been another attack in the village. Come. This just happened. I watched the creature fly west. Towards the coven. I'll check inside. Ehren, Ehren. You've earned his confidence. That's no easy task. I may have earned his trust, but a man who hides his past, who hides his true identity... Are we wise to trust him? Why do you call him "witchslayer" as if it is his name? Because I don't know his true name. He hides his past, while mine was taken from me. But I know he is a good man. Until he is not. Have faith, Ehren. Sometimes things need to be believed in order to be seen. Follow me, they've taken another. How large is the coven? A typical coven is four to five. But everything we've learned, this coven is anything but typical. The head of a coven draws its strength from the collective magic of its members. The larger the coven, the more powerful its leader. What is it this queen wants? I wish I knew. Ehren, if something happens to us, I want you to run. If they take you, you won't be spared a second time. - I'm not afraid of them. - I'm not implying that you are. I'm saying if something happens to us, you'll be all that's left to stand against them. It'd be wiser for you to live to fight another day. The choice will be yours. What's wrong with you? I have a terrible feeling about this coven. It's overwhelming. Your instincts are never wrong. In this case, I hope... -Lara! -It burns. - What is that? - It burns. I don't know. Lara. Thank you, witchslayer. You've done our work for us. Lara. - You know me, Warlock? - You don't remember? How do you know me? Answer me, Warlock! Answer me, Warlock! Run, Ehren! Spells may not work on you, but you're not entirely indestructible. I could kill you right here and now, but my queen wants you alive. Lucky me. I'm going after the Warlock. Why ml Perhaps I should kill her. I knew one day he would come for me. -I am not a witch. -Oh, yes, a powerful one. My family is dead. I have no one. I wish I was dead. I want to die. Kill me. Please kill me now. What happened here is not your fault. You simply have a gift you do not know how to use yet. This is no gift. This is a curse. Believe me when I tell you it is better to have magic than to not. I can teach you how to use it. Magic can offer you a new life. Come with me. You have nothing left here. She is powerful, just as you once were, Lara. You've been teaching her, haven't you? You may be free of the coven, but I sense you still hunger for magic, even if it's not your own. I can give you back your powers. The queen knows nothing of your survival. You can help me kill her. Only to become your slave. I will rule this coven, and you can be my right hand. I am no longer a witch. I'm a witchslayer. And tell me, what kind of life is that? When magic can offer you so much more. Where is he? Where is he? What does this mortal mean to you? -Everything. -Everything but your past. Tell me what happened to me. I need to know where I came from. Your story comes with a price. I missed the bastard. - Are you all right? - I will be. I thought I told you to run. -You never told me where to run to. -Away. I'll get it right next time. Where's the witchslayer? I don't know. Then we find him. Brother? Brother? Brother? Sister! Brother! Hansel! Hansel! No! Let me go! Let me go! Gretl? Gretl. Hello, Hansel. My familiar brought you back to me. The Warlock failed to perform his duties. Are you not pleased to see me alive, brother? It's so good to see you. The last time we were together, I was a little girl. How do you like me now? You are the witch queen? I am. I had a feeling you were the witchslayer. What a strong man you have grown into, boy. Where is my sister? What do you mean, brother? I'm standing right before you. You are not my sister. Zhore! You see the truth. I'm not your sister. But I am all that's left of your sister. Monster. You tried to burn me alive. I did. Imagine my surprise when my power was deflected back on me. When my body was burned, I was forced to take Gretl's as my own. I had no idea that you would survive in the world. No food, no shelter. No family left to run to. Gretl. Hear me. Please. it's me. I want you to fight. Fight for us. Remember who I am. Remember who you are. I'm not entirely to blame for what's happened to you. Your stepmother is guilty as well. She knew that Gretl had the gift. I made a bargain for her. She was happy to oblige, but I had to take you in the bargain as well. -Liar. -Why would I lie? I have nothing to gain. Ask yourself who sent you out into the forest that day. I can only imagine the depths of the hatred that you have for me. And now to see me in the body of somene that you love. I will kill you, witch. Kill me and you kill your sister. Give me what I want and there is a chance she still might live. What do you want from me? The girl that you rescued from the village. Return herto me and I will return your sister to you. And if I don't? Then you will die and so will your sister. Why do you need the girl? The girl for Gretl. It's an even trade and that's all you need to know. I will kill her myself before I hand her over to you. That's your choice. Her blood is on your hands now. Mistress. You make my creature do your work for you. Do you wish to leave my order, Warlock? There is only one way to leave the order, Mistress. In death. Exactly. Burn him. I want him to feel the pain that I felt. Even dead, he will lead the girl to us. Can you perform this simple task, Warlock? Yes, Mistress. Then go. Do you think they killed him? If they wanted him dead, he'd be dead. He survived the creature, but they've taken him. Witchslayer? Witchslayer, are you there? Witchslayer, are you there? Witchslayer? Did you see that? - Witch es. - Yeah. -What are they looking for? -Us. Run! Run! Burn, witch. Did you see that? It's not a game. Yeah, but I feel so powerful. Don't deceive yourself into thinking that this is yours to control. This is a world of magic. And you're just a pawn in it. It runs through everything. It exists in a fine balance and it needs to be respected. If you think you're stronger than it, then I can assure you, you will not be. But it made you strong, didn't it? Magic doesn't make me strong. Character does. W Em mg And it's a fine line, and if you cross it... But you didn't cross it. If I did, he would kill me. As I will have to kill you. Do you understand that? Do you? What's your duty with the coven, Warlock? How did you come to serve Zhore? Male children born with the gift are rare. When my village found that I had the gift, they tried to kill me. Even my father. Zhore found me and taught me how to use my magic. For that, I've sworn to protect the coven, and to add to its numbers for my queen. From what I've heard, I would say that your days are numbered. And for that, I'd say you're right. That Warlock knew you. I was one of their order. He was the warlock that bound me to it. I'm beginning to remember things. Pieces of my time with this coven. There's still some mystical connection between us. - Is that good or bad? - We'll see. Leave the witchslayer to me. If you truly wish to save your sister, I offer you another way. If you help me, we can kill Zhore. What could you possibly offer me? Your sister can be saved. Her soul is held prisoner in Zhore's damaged body. -Where? -The body lies in a tomb inside the Black Forest. Zhore's soul lives in your sister. If you can destroy her body, then you can destroy her. And if you can destroy Zhore, you can restore your sister's body and soul. Why do you need my help? Why not kill her yourself? 'Cause I am bound to her. The familiar will find me. He'll come after me even if she can't. The queen grows weak now. She needs a fresh body with the gift. She seeks to discard Gretl's body for that of the blacksmith's daughter. And if she succeeds, you will lose your sister forever. I see. And what of Lara? How do you know her? Zhore tried to use Lara as her vessel. But Lara resisted, despite the queen's spell. I thought she was destroyed, consumed by her own magic, but she must have transported to wherever you found her. Breaking away from the coven almost killed her. It's not what I wanted. This will lead you to the tomb. It's the best offer I can make. So far, magic has been nothing but a curse to me. Magic can be a good force in this world, Ehren. You've been given this gift for a purpose. It's no coincidence that the witchslayer spared you from the coven. Hmm U r Why are you doing this? Because if she gets the girl, then she will live forever. But if Zhore dies, control of the coven falls to me. And that is all I want. If you honor our bargain, we can go our separate ways. I'll lead the coven far away from here and our two paths shall never cross again. The devil you know. There is one more thing. - The familiar. - Zhore's pet. Even in death, it will protect the queen. You must find a way to destroy it or it will destroy us all. How can I believe any of this, Warlock? Because you still live. Do we have an agreement, witchslayer? Lara. I'm here. I got away from the lair. I'm coming your way. Where are they? I told him to burn Hansel. The Warlock betrayed me, as I knew he would. Find the witchslayer, kill him and bring me back the girl unharmed. I'm almost there. I'm approaching the swamp. I think I can see you. And you survived the Warlock yet again. I made a deal with the Warlock. I agreed to help kill the queen so he can take control of the coven. In return, I get Gretl back. I don't understand. The witch queen is Zhore. -The same witch who took Gretl. -What? I know, I believed them both to be dead years ago. But instead she has taken over Gretl's body. It's in a tomb, but it is failing her. How do you know of this? The Warlock is ambitious. I have something to tell you as well. Some of my memories are coming back. I'm just starting to make sense of them now. - The Warlock can't be trusted. - I do not trust him. He will die when the time is right. Come. Gretl was everything to me. - Did you have siblings? - No. It was just my father and I. My mother died giving birth to me, so he raised me on his own. I think he always wanted a son, but he didn't have one so he taught me everything he knew about hunting and archery and being a blacksmith. Just like he would have a son. -Did he have.... -Magic? No, just me. Gretl always had the gift. Even when she was a little girl. It was our secret. She was born with magic. I was born the opposite of magic. "The opposite of magic"? Immune to potions and spells. It's my fault she was taken. I couldn't protect her from the witch. I need to do everything in my power to save her. The queen needs to be stopped. Even if it means you must sacrifice... I will not lose her a second time. Even if the world turns to hell? If it were you the queen had taken, I would do the same. If there was a chance to save my father, I would make the same choices you do now, no matter the consequences. Once I destroy Zhore's body, Gretl's soul will be released. -We can't be sure of that. -I must be. Someone once told me that sometimes you need to believe things in order to see them. We need a plan. You and Ehren go to the tomb. She will help you. And it would serve to keep her as far away from the queen as possible. We need to wage this final battle on two fronts. I will go to the lair. I'm remembering things that will help us. And I will protect your sister when Zhore leaves her body. Thank you. - Be careful. - You, too. I always am. What? I know this place. What is it? It's where I first encountered Zhore years ago. Are you all right? I was here with Gretl. This is where it all started. The witch lured us here. We were only children. My father had recently passed. Gretl and I were left alone with our stepmother. She led us to this forest. -We're never going to find our way home. -We will. - You promise? - I promise. I promise! It wasn't your fault. Gretl looked up to me like I could protect her from anything. But I couldn't. You were just a child. I promised her we'd get home safe. I broke that promise once, I will not break it again. -Gone. -The queen's pet? - I'm afraid so. - We need to kill it. In all due time. Everything has its weakness. You don't seem to. What happens when we find the queen's tomb? We find my sister. How far still? Damn him! Look at this, nothing. Oh, no! Are we lost? I know the way back, but not forward. Can you remember anything? Anything from the map? The map implied the tomb was to the north. But it indicated only landmarks, not direction. Is it possible to gain your bearings in this forsaken forest? Maybe not. Well done. It takes magic to fight magic. After you, witch. Have you returned for me? Or for him? For myself. If I could have, I would have killed Zhore to spare you. Spare me from what, Abyss? Your queen will be dead soon enough. The witchslayer's on his way to the tomb. Do you think he'll succeed? He's not one to fail. You'll get what you want. Will I? For what I truly want is you. Did you think that you could run from me, Warlock? As long as I breathe, you belong to me. You think that you've betrayed me. You've only succeeded in helping me. You knew! You knew I'd betray you. Sooner or later. The girl lives. The tomb. Help me. - I think it's time. - Indeed. - You need to move the stone. - It's too heavy. Use your magic. Get down. I'm impressed, Warlock, that you were able to keep this hidden from me. You're far more clever than I gave you credit for. Kill me. Kill me. Please. Not yet. When I see you and your true love reunited, before I send you both to the grave. If we get lost in here, we'll never find our way back. The stones. What? My father once said if you're worried about getting lost, you should leave a trail. That day with Gretl, I picked up stones from the ground and laid them down just in case we got lost. But when we went to leave, they were gone. She'd taken them. The witch? Her. Help me. Hansel. Gretl. I'm so sorry. I abandoned you all those years ago. I wasn't strong enough to fight her then, but I'm strong enough now. I need you to trust me, sister. Forgive me for what I'm about to do. It's done. You will serve me well. Through your sacrifice, you will honor me above all others. Can you speak? I will help you. Witchslayer. Witchslayer. Who are you? Gretl. Don't be afraid, I'm not going to hurt you. Your brother sent me to help you. Hansel? Yes, Hansel. Where is he? I'm going to take you to him. Give me your hand. It's okay. It's okay. No. No! Ehren! Ehren! This girl is so powerful. Kill me, you kill the queen. Do it! Do it! Do it! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Help me. Lara, free me. I can restore your magic. You can serve as my right hand. You won't suffer the binding ritual. You'd be free to do with your magic as you wish. You're a tyrant, Abyss. No different than Zhore. I opened your eyes to your gift's true potential! And you embraced it. You embraced your magic, the coven. You were one of us. And you lie. Do I? I remember. My mind is clear now, Warlock. I may have wanted magic, but I never wanted this. You did! Well, it doesn't matter what's come before me. Only matters what's before me now. So goodbye, Warlock. Lara! Run! Find your brother. Go! The coven is now mine. And I have your witchslayer to thank. I am going to restore your magic and you will serve me. You've forgotten, Warlock. My magic has always been strongr than yours. Gretl? Hansel. Gretl. It's all right. This time it really is your sister. It worked. Where have you been? Looking for you. But that's along story. Warlock is dead. Where's Ehren? She's gone. I'm going to make this right. I promise you. Look at me. I promise you. Thank you. I owed you, Hansel. Don't get used to calling me that. What of the witch? She's still out there, for now. Help! Somebody help me! Help! Help! Somebody help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! Anybody! Hello, Zhore. It all ends tonight. Go! Starting your own coven, Lara? Quite the opposite. If you break our bindings, you will lose your magic and this time it will be gone from you forever. It's your decision. So be it. M mm M M And I'll look forward to killing them. I'll send my regards with each and every one. You'll never kill all of us, witchslayer! -Stop. -What is it? Hansel, she and I shared a body for years. She must die. No. She's too old and too waek to harm anyone now. I have much forgiveness in my heart. Gretl, you don't understand what you're asking. - Witchslayer. - We must leave her. Silly girl. It's gone. You're the last of us with magic. I know how much you just gave up. You'd do the same for me. In a heartbeat. Where to now, brother? The witch was right, she won't be the last. We continue to fight to keep the world from going to hell. Come no closer, strangers. These woods are dangerous, even during the day. I hear they are filled with witches. There's no such thing as a witch, strangers. That's what they say, but I know that's not true. Told you she was a witch.
