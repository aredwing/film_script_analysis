Listen, if a guy named Teddy Gish friends you, ignore it. Alright? Do not accept. Aaron: Uh-oh. Mark: You already did. Lea: Uh huh. You know he's in town. Right? Mark: What? Aaron: Why? Lea: Yeah. He's dating this Dartmouth grad student. Lea: It's on his profile. Aaron: No. I never go on there. Gavin: Why don't you want to allow this guy to play in your virtual sandbox? Aaron: Mark never really liked Teddy. Mark: Nobody did. Lea: Hey. Aaron: Remember that time he hid cards up his sleeve for poker? Mark: Yeah. And he was always borrowing money and never paying it back. Aaron: Drinking your last beer. Mark: Bogarting your joint. Aaron: Hitting on your girlfriend behind your back. Gavin: Ah. There it is. Lea: Oh Whose? Yours? Lisa? Mm hmm. Aaron: No. Lea: What? Gavin: What yours? Mark: It was college. I was experimenting. Gavin: What is it with you Americans? Nobody knows how to refill a goddamn wine glass. Gavin: Aaron. Would you like some more wine? Aaron: Why yes. Gavin. Thank you. Mark: Mister Manners. Gavin: Lea? Lea: Yes please. Lea: Well maybe he's changed. Gavin: No. People don't change. Not after adolescence. Mark: The oracle has spoken. Gavin: Nobody really knows anybody anyway. Least of all themselves. Mark: My god. Does anyone have a pen? Gavin: You only know what you want to believe you know about me, my love. Lea: I don't know. I think I've changed a lot since college. So have you guys. Mark: Believe me. This is not a guy that we want back in our lives, okay? Aaron: Yeah let's just keep it online. Mark: No. Not even online. Aaron: Okay. Gavin: So sorry. The loo is off limits for the next 48 hours... to anyone without a Hazmat suit. Mark: That's nice. Dear. Lea: So what's his twin like? [Sound]: AARON ARGUES ON PHONE OFFSCREEN Mark: Whose? Lea: Teddy's. Mark: He doesn't have a twin. Lea: He's on his friend list. Mark: What? What's his name? Lea: Tom? Mark: Yeah that's his brother. But not twin. Lea: They have the same birthday. Gavin: Maybe different years. Lea: Did you ever meet him? Mark: No. Do you know what the odds of that are? Gavin: Three hundred sixty five to two? Mark: No. Aaron: (offscreen) Well there'sa big difference between "it just doesn't feel right" Aaron: And an actual problem with the tracking. Mark: Look, we'd definitely know if Teddy Gish had a twin. Gavin: Maybe he doesn't want you to know. Aaron: Oh, God! Fuck! Aaron: Get the broom! Get the broom! [Sound]: SMALL WINGS FLUTTERING Mark: Here. [Lea screams] Gavin: Get him to fly over here. Get him to fly over here. [Sound]: WINGS FLUTTERING Lea: Aaron! Don't hit it! Aaron... Gavin: It's still alive. Mark: So put it out the window, just... okay. Okay, okay... Mark: O-kay. Lea: Aaron. Lea: You could have chased it outside. Aaron: It would've come back in. Lea: Well, they're good. They eat bugs. Aaron: And carry rabies. Aaron: What? Lea: I thought I saw something. [Sound]: CAR ENGINE STARTING Lea: What? [Sound]: CAR DRIVING AWAY Lea: Oh, sorry. It's nothing. Aaron: Or whatever it was, it's gone. Aaron: Or is it? Lea: Aaron Aaron: What was that? Lea: Oh god! Stop it. Aaron: Sorry. Aaron: Do you have to work tonight? Lea: Ugh, yes. Aaron: How's it going? Lea: Well, it's not The Misfit. Aaron: Really, it's the Grandmother? Lea: Nope. Aaron: Who? Lea: You'll see. Lea: What was that? Aaron: Northern. They're threatening to cancel the new order. Lea: Because of the tracking thing? Aaron: Yeah. Lea: Well can they? What if they do? Aaron: We'll survive. Lea: Well, we can't live off Proem forever. Aaron: I'll deal with it. Lea: Okay. I know. Lea: I'm sorry. Aaron: Don't... tell your parents yet. Lea: Oh god no. Aaron: As long as I'm out here. Lea: Ugh. Mm mm. Well, brush your teeth before you come to bed, mister. Aaron: Yes ma'am. [Music] Katie: Did you get that message? Teddy somebody? Aaron: He came here in person? Katie: He said he might stop by later. I told him you'd be in this afternoon. Aaron: If he comes again, tell him I'm out. Katie: He might see your car. And I don't think lying is part of my job description. Aaron: Well neither is telling the details of my comings and goings to total strangers. Katie: Total strangers? Aaron: Tell him I'm in a meeting. Katie: With whom? Aaron: Myself. Katie: Happy Birthday. Aaron: Katie, wait. Aaron: That's very sweet. Aaron: I'm sorry. Katie: Sorry I befriended your stalker. Aaron: He's not my stalker. Katie: If he comes back, you're in a long meeting. Aaron: Thank you. Katie: Everything okay? Aaron: Yeah. Lea: He can't come home a day early? Cynthia: What do you want? He's giving a speech. Lea: A speech he agreed to give on his son-in-laws 40th birthday? Cynthia: Oh, he doesn't keep track of birthdays. Ah ha. Teddy: Lea? Teddy Gish. Lea: Oh, hi. Lea: Mom, this is Teddy. Teddy, this is my mother. Teddy went to college with Mark and Aaron. Cynthia: Nice to meet you, Teddy. Lea: Teddy and I are friends online but we've never actually met in person. Cynthia: I have no idea how that's possible. Teddy: No, no, we met. Lea: Oh. Teddy: Yeah, you came to visit Mark senior year. Lea: Oh. Right. Of course. Cynthia: What brings you to the area, Teddy? Teddy: My girlfriends finishing up her Ph. D at Dartmouth. Cynthia: Oh really? Maybe you know her. Lea: What department is she in? Teddy: Philosophy. Cynthia: Oh. Lea teaches Literature. Teddy: I know. Cynthia: And what do you do, Teddy? Teddy: Uh, I work from home. Cynthia: I see. Well that's convenient. Lea: So, you're going to be living here for a while? Teddy: Yeah, yeah. For a couple months at least. It's somebody's birthday? Cynthia: Aaron's. But don't tell. It's a surprise. Teddy: Oh, how fun! When? Cynthia: Tonight. Lea: Actually Mom, it's not a surprise anymore. He heard me talking about it with Mark. Cynthia: Oh... He could have pretended. Oh, hey, Teddy! Why don't you come? You'll be the surprise. Bring your girlfriend. Teddy: Oh. Lea: I... I don't think we have enough food, Mom. Cynthia: Well... Lea: Hmm. Yeah... Teddy: I have been dying to show off Simone. Cynthia: Simone? What a pretty name. Teddy: Yeah, pretty face too. Lea: Okay... well... Teddy: Actually though, Uh... Simone's a vegan. Lea: Oh. Cynthia: Well there will be a salad and we're having shrimp cocktail. Teddy: No, unfortunately not but... Lea: I don't think so, Mom. Teddy: We can bring a vegan dish. Lea: Well it's not really a potluck thing. Cynthia: Sure! Lea: But you know, we could go out to dinner sometime for vegan, Teddy: No. You know what? She'll be fine. She'll be fine. She eats like a bird anyway. Lea: A vegan bird. Teddy: Right. [Sound]: JAZZ MUSIC ON THE STEREO Teddy: To old friends. Teddy: And uh, new narratives. Lea: And new friends. Mark: And um... The birthday boy. Teddy: Yes, the birthday boy. Aaron: Thank you. Cynthia: Aaron, you couldn't just play along? Aaron: She knew I heard. It was too late. Gavin: Sounds like a recipe for a heart attack if you ask me. Mark: Oh, did somebody? Teddy: Well, I have a surprise, actually. Simone: No, Teddy. Teddy: Uh, today is actually Simones birthday too. Aaron: Really? Lea: Happy Birthday. Mark: Happy Birthday, Simone. Everyone: Happy Birthday. Lea: Why don't you try it with it going from inside and then out? Gavin: It's going to look like a dart board. Lea: It's not going to look like a dart board, don't worry. Lea: Oh, hey... Thank you. Simone: I am so sorry. He didn't tell me it was your husbands birthday party. Lea: Oh... Simone: He said we were going out for a surprise. Lea: Oh, no don't worry about it. Simone: Um, maybe I should go. Lea: What? No, no, no, no, no. Hey, Happy Birthday, come here. Lea: It's okay, you want a drink? How about a beer? It's organic, and local. Lea: Okay. Gavin, beer. Simone: Thank you. Aaron: Thanks for thinking of me Teddy, but I'm kind of all-in with my kayaks right now. Teddy: I heard there was a problem with those. Aaron: Where did you hear that? Teddy: Hmm, I don't remember. Teddy: Anyway, we're not talking about a lot of money here, dude. And it'd be first in, first out. Aaron: Fifty grand is a lot of money. Teddy: Really? Aaron: It's just not the right time. Teddy: Just come by and see it. The location, un-fucking-believable. It just needs a gut job. Aaron: Well that'll cost more than fifty grand. Teddy: No shit. You're not the only investor I'm talking to. Teddy: You think Lea would be interested? Aaron: I speak for both of us. Teddy: How about her parents? Aaron: No. Teddy: Well, Aaron... with all that happened with me and Proem, you don't think you could throw a little my way? Aaron: With you and Proem? Teddy: You know. Aaron: No, Teddy, I don't. Teddy: Really. Teddy: Huh. Teddy: You know, Neil told me Teddy: Before he died, he said some kind of interesting things. Teddy: He was like, quoting a lot of stuff. Teddy: Like, he said, History is the version of past events that people have decided to agree on. Aaron: He was obsessed with Napoleon. Teddy: Yeah, but this was in the context of Proem. And Version 2.0. Aaron: How? Teddy: I don't know. That doesn't make any sense to you? Aaron: Well, he was pretty delusional at the end. Teddy: Yeah, this was a little before that though. Teddy: He also said something about Proem maybe not really being worth what everybody thought it was worth. Aaron: It was worth what the market said it was worth. Teddy: No, it was more like, it wasn't actually what the market thought it was. Aaron: What does that mean? Teddy: I don't know. I always wondered about that. Teddy: So, Mark's baby sister. "Little Lee-Lee. " Aaron: It's just Lea now. Teddy: Quite the catch, man. Aaron: I'm a lucky man. Teddy: Mm hmm, you can say that again. Teddy: Hey, I heard you guys did that whole weekend-long retreat thing, Teddy: All that like, uh, sharing and soul searching. Aaron: Who told you that? Teddy: Neil. He and Marnie did it too. Teddy: Yeah, he said it was great. Make sure you both really know each other, Teddy: That you both really know what you're getting into and all that, right? Aaron: That's the idea. Teddy: Isn't that like a Catholic thing? Aaron: Uh, I think so, originally. Teddy: You think Simone and I should do it? Aaron: You're not engaged, are you? Teddy: No. Aaron: Well I think the idea is to do it before, you know, a lifelong commitment. Teddy: So apparently you passed muster. Aaron: HaHa... Apparently. Teddy: No major deal killers. Aaron: Guess not. Teddy: Or none you cared to share, anyway. Or dared to. Aaron: We shared everything. Teddy: Even Gitta Glitter? Aaron: Her last name was Girard. Teddy: Yeah? Well, I'll always remember her as Gitta Glitter. Teddy: You didn't, did you? Teddy: You know how she got that nickname, right? Teddy: Yeah, maybe you're better off not knowing. Aaron: Oh. Wow. Teddy. Teddy: Sorry. Teddy: Tell me you don't have a Touch already. Aaron: Actually, uh... Mark: Yeah, hence the uh, Nano. Teddy: No! I should've got more intel. Aaron: One for the office? Lea: Oh, three iPods? Gavin: Yeah. Like a good American. Cynthia: Or for your car. Teddy: It's got my top ten Dead shows on it. Teddy: Fillmore East, 1970. Oxford Speedway 88. Mark: Weren't we at that one? Teddy: Yeah, of course, sophomore summer. I made it myself. Aaron: Remember, everybody thought Dylan was gonna sit in. Mark: Yeah, who opened for them? Teddy: Little Feet! Aaron: Didn't Branford Marsalis sit in? Teddy: No. Nassau Coliseum 90. You guys. Simone: Wait, Branford Marsalis toured with The Dead? Teddy: Nah, he just sat in a couple of times. Aaron: He's never played this for you? Simone: No. Aaron: Well, Happy Birthday. Teddy: She's never heard any of that stuff. Aaron: Well, now she can. Simone: I've heard some of it. Actually, um, thank you, but I couldn't. Teddy: Yeah, nevermind, I'll just take it back if you dont want it. Mark: Shit, I'll take it. Teddy: Or you could at least give it to your wife. Lea: Yeah, okay. Aaron: It's not your birthday. Mark: And you hate The Dead. Teddy: I'll just take it back, never mind. Aaron: No, no, no. You know what, I'd love to hear these in my car. Aaron: Um, thank you Teddy. It's way too much, but thank you. Teddy: Nah, it's nothing. Aaron: No, it's really nice. Teddy: Kampai. Simone: Japanese for "Cheers. " Cynthia: Oh, I knew that. Cynthia: Kampai. Gavin: Salud. Teddy: Nazdrave. Cynthia: Is that Russian? Aaron: Czech. Teddy: Very good. Good memory. [Music]: FOREBODING MUSIC [music]CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON THE STEREO Lea Laughs Aaron: What? Lea: Come here. Lea: Oh my god. Wow. Lea: Teddy posted it. Aaron: How do I delete it? Lea: Uh, you can't. Aaron: He didn't ask my permission. Lea: He doesn't have to. Aaron: Well, how can I get my fucking name off of it? Lea: Just, untag yourself. Aaron: How? Lea: There will be a link next to your name. Lea: You have to log on as yourself. Aaron: So it's just sitting out there. Forever. Lea: You can ask him to delete it. Aaron: Teddy. Lea: I thought you were going to ignore his friend request. Aaron: He wouldn't stop bugging me. Lea: By the way, you looked totally hot. Lea: Somebody touched a nerve. Lea: So, who was Gitta Girard? Aaron: Where is it? Lea: Right there! Lea: So? Aaron: What? Lea: Gitta? Aaron: It's all a bit of a blur. Lea: Seems like she'd be pretty hard to forget. Teddy: I'm sorry I brought my girlfriend to your birthday party. Aaron: Nah, it was fun. Teddy: I just thought it would be a cool surprise. For both of you. Aaron: It was. Teddy: Thank you. Aaron: But, I'm not a big fan of being tagged in photos online. Teddy: I thought you'd get a kick out of that. Aaron: I didn't. Teddy: I bet Lea did. Teddy: Okay, Mr. Old-fashioned. Aaron: Well, I better Teddy: You ever wonder what happened to Gitta? Aaron: Not particularly. Teddy: You didn't keep in touch? After you broke her heart? Aaron: I didn't break her heart. Teddy: I did. Aaron: What? Teddy: Kept in touch. Aaron: Good for you. Teddy: She's happily married now too. Or married, anyway. Teddy: In fact, she lives in Montreal. That's actually just a few hours north of here, isn't it? Aaron: Yeah, about three. Teddy: You never wish it was you? Aaron: What? Teddy: Happily married to Gitta Glitter? Aaron: I am happily married. Teddy: 'Course you are. Aaron: Gotta get to work. Teddy: I'm sure she'd love to hear from you. She'd probably be too shy to friend you though. Teddy: Maybe you should friend her. Aaron: Maybe I will. Teddy: Or I could tell her you said it was okay for her to friend you. Aaron: Enough! Okay? [Music] Teddy: Hey, look who's here! Teddy: Did we miss much? Gavin: No, they just started. Teddy: Great Lea: Do you guys want to join us? Teddy: Sure. Simone: Thank you. Simone: Oh! Don't worry, we can sit on the ground. Aaron: No, we've got another one in the car. Teddy: But you're gonna miss the show. Aaron: It'll just take a few minutes. Teddy: I'll come with you. Aaron: No. No, it's okay. Lea: Simone, sit down. Teddy: You know if you just hear me out on this thing, Aaron. I think you'll see its got mad potential. Aaron: I'm just not looking for something like that right now, Teddy. Teddy: Like what? You don't even know what it is. Aaron: Teddy, how many different ways do you want me to say no? Teddy: Aaron, we all know what Proem sold for. Aaron: A long time ago. Teddy: Don't you think the least you could do is hear me out? Considering all that happened with me and Proem? Aaron: You never worked for Proem, Teddy. - Teddy: Before it was Proem - when it was just an idea. Our idea. In Prague. Aaron: Even if you were, in fact, there when we thought of it... Teddy: I said what if? I planted the seed. Aaron: Everybody in the world said what if? But we figured it out. Mark, Neil, and me. Teddy: Yeah, after you pushed me out. Aaron: You were never in. Teddy: Aaron, I know I could be kind of difficult back then... Aaron: No, Teddy - come on. That's not... Teddy: No it's okay. I know. But, I've actually changed a lot. Aaron: We all have. Ever since Prague it seemed like you and Mark didn't want to be my friend anymore. Aaron: Come on Teddy! We never were. Neil was. Teddy: He didn't like you as much as you think he did, you know. Teddy: He once said you were a non-player. Aaron: Goddammit. Katie: What? Aaron: Nothing. Aaron: Can I see your message log? Katie: Whose number do you need? Aaron: Can I just see it, please? Aaron: Thank you. Aaron: I'll give it back to you in a minute. Katie: Okay. Aaron: Close the door. Aaron: What do you want, Teddy? Gitta: Come in. Gitta: Aaron? Gitta: You have some explaining to do, mister. Aaron: What are you doing here? Gitta: You didn't expect me? Gitta: Teddy told me that... He told me that you wanted to see me. Aaron: I'm gonna kill him. Gitta: I am such a fool. I'm sorry. Aaron: Wait. Wait. Gitta: Please just let me go. Aaron: I have some explaining to do? Gitta: You just... disappeared. Aaron: You never answered my letter. Gitta: What letter? Gitta: What What letter? Aaron: The day I left I left you a letter. I asked you to come join me. Gitta: No, you just disappeared. Aaron: No, I gave it to Neil to give to you. Gitta: Why would you write such a letter? What if I didn't receive it? Gitta: You hoped that I wouldn't receive it. That was your passive way out. Aaron: No, I gave it to Neil the day I left to give to you. Aaron: Why didn't he give it to you? Gitta: You didn't want to be with me. Aaron: No, I did. I... I waited. Gitta: You didn't know how to explain me. Aaron: No I... assumed. Gitta: Then why would you do such a thing, Aaron? Gitta: It's so unlike you. What if I didn't receive it? I didn't receive it. Gitta: You look good. Aaron: So do you. Aaron: I'm married. Gitta: Do you love her? Aaron: Yes. Gitta: Good for you. Gitta: Why didn't you try harder? Aaron: I'm sorry. I'm sorry Aaron: What? Aaron: That, uh... Aaron: That girl that was in the photo with me that Teddy posted... Lea: Yeah? Aaron: She was actually my girlfriend at the time. Sort of Lea: Well what happened to her? Aaron: I don't know. Lea: I mean why did you break up? Aaron: It's just... It never would have worked out. I had to go back to the States and... Lea: And? Aaron: She was... Aaron: She was a call girl. Lea: So she wasn't your girlfriend. Aaron: No, she was. Lea: And she was a prostitute? Aaron: It was complicated. Lea: You really should have told me about her, Aaron. Aaron: I was too afraid. Lea: I knew that there was something you weren't sharing. I knew it. Aaron: This is it. I swear. Lea: You think that was easy for me? Aaron: No. Lea: What I shared? Aaron: I know. Lea: That was the whole point, Aaron. Aaron: I know. Lea: Why would you need to go see a prostitute? Aaron: It was Neil and Teddy's thing. Lea: Thing? Aaron: Yeah they found this place... it was really hip and exciting. Aaron: We were young. Neil had more money than we knew what to do with. Lea: So you decided to go buy some women? Aaron: This is the only thing that I haven't told you about, Lea. I swear. Lea: You loved her. Aaron: No. Lea: Yeah that's why it took you so long to commit. Aaron: No, it had nothing to do with that. Lea: What did that have to do with? Aaron: Lea... Aaron: Still not talking to me? Aaron: I think you're overreacting. Lea: I don't care what you think. Aaron: But he seems to think he was pushed out somehow. From Proem. Mark: Bullshit. You know he tried that same crap with me at the reunion? Aaron: Well that's what he thinks. Mark: You just need to stop talking to him, dude. I think he might know something about you-know-what Aaron: "You-know-what?" Mark: Yeah I think Neil might have told him about Plan B before he died. Aaron: Plan B? Mark: Where we all pretend that you think Neil and I fixed the hole? Aaron: But you did. Mark: Oh come on Aaron. It wasn't fixable. It was hide-able in the code. Mark: Aaron? Aaron: What would that mean if that came out? Mark: It's impossible to find, trust me. Aaron: Unless he knew where to look. Or he wouldn't be sniffing around you for it he'd be using it. Aaron: Using it? How? Mark: Well he could... No, that's not gonna happen. Aaron: What if it did? Aaron: Can't like couldn't or can't like shouldn't? Mark: Just stop talking to him. Aaron: Just hear me out? Lea: I'm parked over here. Lea: Pretty. Aaron: Please Lea. What do I do? Lea: I guess what's done is done. Aaron: Meaning? Lea: I don't know. Aaron: I'm sorry. Aaron: Nobody in the world means more to me than you. Aaron: Will you let me take you to dinner? Lea: That would be a start. Lea: Yeah well. You know you guys aren't getting any younger. Well... You know what I mean. Yeah. Lea: Well. You know, maybe Dad's just going to have to be more careful and Lea: Maybe you're going to have to be the one... ...that makes sure that he and what did you say? [Lea talks on Phone] [Lea talks on Phone] Lea: It's the truth. Yeah. Well. I think Dad would take it a lot better... Oh, hold on a sec, Mom. Aaron: I have to go meet Teddy for a beer. Lea: Okay. Aaron: He's got some investment thing he wants to talk about. Lea: How long are you going to be? Aaron: I don't know... Uh. Couple hours? Lea: Okay. Drive safe. Teddy: I thought you should have that back. Aaron: Why do you have this? Teddy: Uh. Well, the day you and Mark left Prague? Uh, I was bored so I went over to Madame K's for some fun. Teddy: Neil gave it to me to give to Gitta. Aaron: He gave it to you? Teddy: Yeah. Aaron: And? Teddy: Well. I was just going to peek at it but then when I read it... Teddy: I realized it was kinda the perfect way to finally have a go with Gitta. Teddy: Cause you weren't very generous with her. Aaron: How much do you want? Teddy: I want to know about the hole. Aaron: What hole? Teddy: The flaw in Version 2.0. What Neil was talking about before he died. Aaron: Neil was delusional. Teddy. Teddy: Yeah? No. I think it was more like guilty conscience. Aaron: I don't know what you're talking about. Teddy: I think you do. Aaron: Did you have something on Neil too? From freshman year or something? Teddy: Have something? Aaron: Or did he just see something in you no one else the world could see? Teddy: I was his best friend. Teddy: Hey. You know Aaron? The thing I never understood about Gitta? Teddy: Why was she such a popular whore? Considering what a terrible fuck she was? Teddy: I mean. Right? Aaron: Fuck. [Crickets chirping] Lea: Oh. Hey. Lea: What's wrong? Aaron: Total waste of time. Lea: Well. I was surprised you went. Aaron: Coffee? Lea: Book proposal. Due tomorrow. Aaron: Oh. Right. Lea: You're gonna have time in the morning to read it. Right? Aaron: Yeah. Lea: So what did he want? Started out promising enough but it turns out he doesn't know what he's talking about. Aaron: Hasn't thought it through. Lea: Are you sure you're okay? Aaron: Just incredibly annoyed. Lea: Well. I better get back to it. Lea: Oh god. 10:30 already? Aaron: I'm gonna Lea: Oh. Aaron, don't start again. Aaron: I already have. Lea: I know. Why? [Crickets] [Aaron vomits] [Garbage Bag ruffles] [Phone rings] Aaron: Why don't you get up early? Lea: Mmm. No I can't. I'm on a roll. Lea: Thanks. Honey. Aaron: You'll be fresher in the morning. Lea: Mmm. I have to finish it tonight so I can proof it in the morning. Aaron: Okay. Lea: Thanks. Aaron: Good luck. Aaron: 'night Lea: Good night Aaron: I've gotta go to the office. Lea: Oh. Really? Aaron: I've gotta take care of this Northern thing. Lea: Well. Are you gonna have time to read this? Aaron: Can you e-mail it to me? Lea: I guess. Katie: Oh my god! What are you doing here? Aaron: What are you doing here? Katie: I have some stuff to catch up on. Aaron: I don't pay you to work on Saturdays. Katie: I know. Aaron: Don't stay all day. Katie: I won't. Aaron: Did you call the police? Simone: They won't even consider him missing. Simone: You know, if he were planning to go somewhere, he'd bring his laptop. Aaron: Do you have his computer? Simone: Yeah. It's in the car. Aaron: Well. I could try to get into it, if you want. Simone: Oh. Okay. Aaron: Maybe we can find something to convince them to start looking for him right away. Simone: What did he want to ask you about? Aaron: Simone. I think Teddy may be in trouble. Simone: What kind of trouble? Aaron: Last night he asked me to stake him some money but for a drug deal. Lea: Last night? Simone: Oh. Teddy. Lea: So what do you think could've happened to him? Aaron: I don't know. But he seemed pretty desperate. I think he might've already owed somebody some money. Simone: So why didn't you lend it to him? Lea: Okay so you refused, and left. Simone: Okay. Uh, come with me, and tell this to the police. Simone: You know. Then maybe they can start looking for him right away. Aaron: What if- what if he's not missing? Lea: Aaron's right. I mean, what if you go to the police, and he's not missing? Aaron: Devil's advocate. If he's not, if he doesn't want to be found, Aaron: We could get him into a lot of trouble if we go to the police. Simone: But he's obviously already in a lot of trouble. Aaron: We don't know that for sure. Simone: Why is his car still there? Lea: Maybe he took a ride with somebody. Simone: Oh. God. Where? Who with? Aaron: If I could get into his laptop maybe we can find a lead. Simone: Okay. Lea: It's gonna be alright, okay? He's gonna turn up. Lea: A drug deal? Aaron: I figured the less you knew, the better. Lea: And I completely believed you. Aaron: I should go to the office. I don't have the right software here. Aaron: Oh! Your proposal. Lea: I already submitted it. Aaron: Shit. I'm sorry. Aaron: Don't wait up. This could take a while. It could be all night. Lea: I won't.

Aaron: No. Mark: And he never told you who they were. Aaron: Uh uh Mark: No luck with his computer? Aaron: Nope. Mark: You? Mark: Well. The police will get into it. Aaron: I hope so. Mark: Fucking Teddy. Probably got himself killed. Not that that would be such a bad thing. Aaron: I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. [Music. Sound]: FOREBODING MUSIC, BIRDS, CRICKETS Mark: Lets do it. Mark: What. Wednesday, you free Wednesday? Aaron: Uh.

[Sound]: AARON HYPERVENTILATES Mark (o. S.): Yeah? Has there been any word? Any leads? Aaron: So are they calling him a missing person yet? Simone: Finally. Aaron: We'll do anything we can to help. Tom: Uh. Can we uh, speak in private? Aaron: Sure. Um Tom: Maybe outside? And then we should be going. Tom: I know he's dead. Aaron: You do? Tom: Yeah. It's hard to explain. I just... I just know. Aaron: I see. Tom: Well. And he, he sent me this sort of cryptic e-mail the day before he... Tom: Disappeared saying that if anything happened to him, That it was all in a folder with my name on his computer. Aaron: Really? Tom: I didn't wanna get into this in front of Simone. Aaron: Oh. No. Tom: And he sent me his password but it's not working. Aaron: Hm. Tom: You don't think you might've locked it up or something by trying and failing too many times? Aaron: No. I didn't even try to guess it. I tried to bypass it, but he had it set up so you couldn't. Or anyway I couldn't. Tom: I see. Well. The police have an expert coming up from Concord to work on it, so... Hopefully they'll get into it. Aaron: Okay. Tom: You don't know anything about the kind of people he's doing this drug deal with? Where they were from? Aaron: Unfortunately. No. Tom: Well look. Aaron, Tom: If you're holding anything back, like, because you're thinking he's still alive, to protect him, I understand. Tom: He would've appreciated that. But, I think you should tell them everything you know. Aaron: Unfortunately. Like I said, I left as soon as he brought it up. I didn't want to know.

A long time ago. In Europe, after college. Why? Miller: When was the last time you saw her? Aaron: I don't even remember. Pond: Recently? Aaron: No. Pond: Well. Is there anything else you can tell us that relates to this drug deal? Aaron: No. Like I said, I didn't want to know anything about it. Miller: Um. Why did you try to hack into his computer? Aaron: Well. Simone, his girlfriend, say you guys, uh, Aaron: So I was trying to find some information... ...to convince you to do something earlier. Pond: We might have if we'd known about this drug deal. Aaron: Well. Like you, I thought we should wait... ...a little bit to see if he was really missing. Miller: Give him some time to close the deal? Aaron: No. Pond: We're just trying to find your friend. [Sound]: TYPING ON COMPUTER KEYBOARD Aaron: So. What did they ask you about before I got here? Katie: They said I shouldn't discuss it with anyone else. Aaron: I don't think they meant me. Katie: I think maybe they did. Aaron: I think they meant like friends and family. People who aren't involved in the case. Katie: Am I involved? Aaron: Well technically. Through me because I know him, and you met him when he came to the office. Katie: They asked me about that Saturday. The day after your friend, the day after Mr. Gish disappeared. Aaron: You told them I was working at the office? Katie: Yeah. Aaron: Good. Katie: And that you left as soon as I got here. Katie: And that you weren't exactly thrilled... ...when he came by here looking for you earlier. Aaron: That's not really any of their business. Katie: Do you think he's dead? Aaron: He'll turn up. Don't worry. Katie: How do you know? Aaron: He may be in a lot of trouble, but, he'll turn up. Lea: The police were here looking for you. Right after you left. Aaron: I spoke with them at the office. Lea: What did they wanna know? Aaron: Well. Since I was apparently the last one who saw him ali... I was the last person to see him that night. Lea: Alive? Aaron: Last person to see him that night. Lea: You think he's dead? Aaron: Honestly, Lea? I wouldn't be all that surprised if he was. Lea: Oh my god, don't say that. Aaron: Well given what he was up to? Did they talk to you? Aaron: About what? Lea: What time you left and came back. Aaron: That's it? Lea: And what I knew about your relationship with Teddy. Aaron: What did you tell them? Lea: The truth. Aaron: Which is what? Lea: When did you guys first meet Tom? Aaron: I don't know. Uh... freshman year I guess. Lea: You know he's dead. Aaron: What? Lea: Yeah. That's why you were so shocked to see Tom. Aaron: No. Lea: You didn't know he had a twin. Aaron: Yes. I did. Lea: No, neither did Mark, not until I told him the other night. Aaron: No. Lea: You were in the other room. Mark said you guys didn't know. Aaron: He doesn't know everything I know. Lea: You just said you guys both met him in college. Aaron: Maybe I was wrong. Maybe Mark didn't meet him. Lea: Aaron. Something is not... Aaron: He must've forgotten. Lea: Aaron. What is going on? Lea: Whatever it is, you can tell me. Aaron: I killed him. Aaron: By accident but nobody's gonna believe that. Lea: Oh my god. Aaron: I... I punched him. And he fell and hit his head. Lea: Why did you punch him? Aaron: He threatened you. Aaron: He was trying to scare me into giving him the money he wanted. Aaron: He implied that bad things might happen to you if I didn't. Lea: Like what? Aaron: I don't know. That's when I hit him. Lea: Oh my god Lea: Where is his body? Aaron: It's better that you don't know. Lea: Aaron, we have to call the police. You have to tell them. Aaron: And go to prison? Lea: You have to turn yourself in. You, you've made this bad enough already. Aaron: I'm not going to prison because of that guy.

Lea: What about Simone? Aaron: She's better off without him. Lea: His parents? Aaron: They're dead. Lea: His brother. Tom? Aaron: No one will miss him, Lea. Lea: How can you say that? Aaron: We can do this. Lea: Where did you put him, Aaron? [Sound]: PUTS PHONE BACK IN CRADLE Aaron: Do I deserve to go to prison for defending you? Lea: If you tell them now, you might not have to.
