Was fought where wolfsberg manor. Now stands. Vampires and. Werewolves fought to death. Thousands on each side were. Lost. But werewolves prevailed. This becomes sacred land. The varcolacs become the great. Protectors. Now dragomir is. Gone. Without bloodline werewolf. To protect the sacred land, The vampires will try again to. Gain control. If they do, It will be signal for them. To rise up and feed upon. Human race. No one will be safe. This will become a world ruled. By the undead! Maybe you should tell dad? What about me?
