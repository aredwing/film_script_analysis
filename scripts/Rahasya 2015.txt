Like a fight...or someone screaming? No, sir... Tell me the truth or... Sir... ...when Riyaz left the building... ...his arm was bleeding and there was a bandage around it. He was in a fit of anger... You can leave now. Go! He left home at eleven last night... ...to meet a friend... ...he hasn't returned since then... There's nothing to worn] about... ...this isn't the first time... ...he stays out for days together... ...with his cellphone off. Young people...can't stop them... What was his relation with Ayesha Mahajan? Who's Ayesha? Dr. Sachin and Dr. Aarti Mahajan's daughter, from across the street. Riyaz has many girlfriends. We can't keep track of all of them... Well... ...this girl has been murdered. And your son Riyaz was in her bedroom at the time of the murder. Not so funny now, hmm? Dabbang...let's go. Scratch marks on his chest... ...and a lump on the back of his head... We've sent his blood for the tests... Did you get any lead on Chetan? The police is not answerable to you. Where? Hey underpants... Who's Sudhakar Mishra? Yes sir, it's me... - Sudhakar Mishra? Yes... - So, you're a caterer? Yes, sir... And, you sir? Can't you see who we are? What's your relation to Chetan Tiwari? ...he's my brother-in-law... Where is he now? What's the matter, sir? You'll find out. Dabbang...he's yours... What for...? Where are you taking me...? What have I done...? - Come on... I haven't done anything... Where's Chetan Tiwari? Don't try my patience... ...I'll hit you where it hurts most... You'll never stand erect then. Tell me now, where's Chetan? I haven't heard from him for the last two days. So, you don't know, huh? I'm telling the truth... Like I give a f. Dabbang... - Yes, sir. This Chetan Tiwari hails from Bihar... This guy spat out his hometown address... Send this info to the Bihar Police, now! Sir, this Chetan Tiwari has a criminal record... These rich people ought to... ...employ domestic help only after police verification. But do they ever learn? What now, sir? - Now... Here...have these roasted peas... Mr. Malwade... ...as per the autopsy... ...I'd place the time of the murder at around 12:30 a.m... There are scratches on the victim's arms and shoulders... There was a struggle before death... Rape? No. Read the post-mortem report Yeah, mom...we'll reach in a couple of hours... Yeah, I'll call you soon... Hi... Really sorry to hear what happened... We are helpless against God's wish... That's true... Are you guys leaving this place? The Police has sealed our apartment. Stay with me till things get sorted... Thanks, pal... ...but we'll be staying with Aarti's parents for a while. I'm really sorry about what's happened. Don't hesitate if you need any help... Absolutely... - Anyway...You take care... Thanks for the offer. Call me if you need any help... Absolutely... Let me know if there's anything we can do... ...take care. Take care Aani... See you...bye. Come on... I'm sorry your holiness, give us a minute, please... Dr. Sachin Mahajan... You're under arrest... What the hell are you talking about? You're the prime suspect for your daughter's murder. There's some misunderstanding... You can say that in court, ma'am. Dabbang, take him. Just a moment! You can't just do this...! Come on, quick now, I don't have all day. Hold on, listen to me... There's some misunderstanding... Listen inspector...please... Come on, get up Doctor... Hold on, listen to me... Please...just listen...one second, please just listen to me... Let go of me! Don't touch me...! - Hold him...come on... Struggling is not going to help you... - Come on... Please, at least listen to me once...please... Your honour... Dr. Sachin Mahajan's blood report states that... ...he was under the influence of alcohol that night... A pen, that has Dr. Mahajan's fingerprints, was found... ...lying on the floor near the victim's body. The police discovered from his clinic that... ...Dr. Sachin often carried this son of pen... A blood-stained shin was discovered... ...in the common garbage dump inside the building premises. Objection your honour, The blood-stains on this shin... ...are not of the victim - Ayesha Mahajan. Yes...you're right. Sir... According to the forensic tests... ...these blood-stains belong to a 'young male'... ...who as per the Police is most probably... ...Riyaz Noorani... ...who's been absconding since the night of the murder. And - as per the DNA tests... ...the scratch marks on Dr. Sachin Mahajan's body... ...were made by the deceased Ayesha Mahajan and vice-versa! A hair-strand, proven by DNA tests to be Dr. Sachin Mahajan's hair... ...was found between the victim's fingers. The post-mortem report states that... Ayesha Mahajan, at the time of her death, had been pregnant for a month. Sir, the case is crystal clear. That night, a drunk Dr. Sachin reached home at midnight... ...only to see Riyaz Noorani...a Muslim youth... ...inside his daughter's bedroom. ...he flew into a rage and attacked Riyaz. Though Riyaz escaped... ...Ayesha succumbed to Dr. Mahajan's murderous rage. He's lying, your honour...! Then, to destroy the evidence... ...he tried disposing his blood-stained shin. And finally... ...he bribed his servant Chetan Tiwari, to leave with his belongings... ...so that... ...Chetan becomes the prime suspect. The next witness please... ...lnspector Ram Charan Pandey - Bihar Police. Sir... ...we've scanned the whole of Bihar... ...but there's no trace of Chetan Tiwari anywhere. He was affiliated to the mob in Bihar. He's hiding at the moment. I don't remember much of what happened that night... I'd had one drink too many... ...and when I drink excessively, I do not remember much the next morning... But...Ayesha... ...was our only child... She was my child... My Ayesha... There's some mistake here... There's some mistake... I didn't kill her... She was my child... Please believe me... Dr. Sachin Mahajan... ...is remanded to judicial custody... ...till the defense council submits the defense statement. Inspector Malwade, How did you crack this case so quickly? It's our duty, ma'am. We did it sincerely. That's all. Mr. Malwade...Mr. Malwade... one question please... Do you think Chetan Tiwari will be apprehended? Of course, he'll be caught! What do you suppose we do inside the Police station? Eat roasted peas? Ayesha was our everything, Aarti... ...we could have spent more time with her... Sachin... ...what exactly happened that night? You know - when I drink too much... ...I can't remember much the next morning... ...you know that... Aarti, you too? ...even you don't trust me...? I don't believe this! Smita ma'am... ...this lady has lost her daughter... ...and her husband has been falsely accused of killing his own daughter... The Police have wrapped up the case in haste... ...without analyzing the evidence thoroughly... This is an appeal to you ma'am, from our NGO... ...please help this lady get justice. I'll look into it. Paraskar... Sunil Paraskar... ...from the C.B.l. (Central Bureau of Investigation) Walnuts? They're good for the brain... Alright. The Police did such a good job on your case... ...that we...the C.B.l. had to be called in. But for you, it's like moving from hell to high waters. Not funny? Not a problem. Only one person ever laughs at my jokes... Me. Anyway, I studied your file... The post-mortem report says that... ...the incision on Ayesha's neck... ...was a single steady cut... ...a neat and clean slice... ...two inches deep... ...through tissue... ...muscle... ...and flesh... Don't do this! Enough... Leave me alone! Please... But then, Dr. Mahajan... ...it struck me... ...weren't you heavily drunk that night? Were you pissed drunk or not? Yes. - A drunk man couldn't have made such a neat and precise cut. Exactly! Therefore... ...tell me what exactly happened that night? I don't remember anything... I don't remember... - We have ways of refreshing memories... Like these walnuts. I didn't kill my daughter. ...she was my daughter... why would I kill her...? Because Dr. Sachin Mahajan... ...there's more to you than meets the eye. What? What do you mean? What are you going to do? All the bloody proof is already against me. I didn't kill my daughter, damn it! That estate agent had called... ...you must have been avoiding him, I'm sure... Do you know about Ashok Kamble...? What about him? He's purchased his own apartment...isn't he junior to you? Yeah, so what? So... Where will we stay after you retire? This Govt. apartment won't be ours then... Have you given this a thought? Yes, I think about it everyday. That's all you do...think! Asha, it's not easy to buy an apartment. No seller bids below ten million. ...how do you expect me to afford it? How the hell did Ashok Kamble afford it? Don't know. But I'll know soon... ...when the dept. raids his house. Excuse me? Someone's at the door for you... Yeah, I'm coming... Go, catch up with your brother... Yes, tell me... We are from the ICICI bank... Yeah, so? You haven't paid the mortgage on your car for the past three months. Next month... For sure... Yeah, Parvez... Get Dr. Mahajan's apartment ready for a re-examination. Please come. How do you like the house, Parvez? It's grand, sir... Where's the girl's room? Upstairs, sir... And the father's room? - That's upstairs too. Let's go... The pen was found here, right? Yes, sir... Parvez... -Sir... ...it's cracked at the bottom. Could have fallen, or... Look at this garment... Sir, it's torn... Torn by someone's bare hands... Check those drawers. Bring the kit... Sir... Put off the lights. There are blood-stains here, someone has washed something here... Sir, should I take a swab...? - The trace is too faint. You won't be able to take a swab. Sir...this is Dr. Sachin's bedroom... Yeah... Sir...that's Riyaz's blood... How do you know? Sir, the District Attorney mentioned it in court. But the report merely states - 'Young male'. Do the Police have Riyaz's blood sample? No, sir... - So, then? Do you think, that after attacking Riyaz and murdering his own daughter... ...Dr. Mahajan would go off to sleep in the same blood-stained shin? Not possible, sir... But he was heavily drunk, so anything is possible... It's possible, sir... Is it possible or not possible? Don't know, sir... - Walnuts? I got them, sir. - Eat... Can you hear me!!? Yes sir, I can hear you... Parvez, can you hear me? Yes sir, tell me. I can hear you clearly! Yes sir, tell me... Tell you what? You were saying something from inside? Of course not. You've started imagining things now. Close the door. Are you mad at me? No sir, why? I've been teasing you since morning... No sir, not at all. Should I continue then...? Send this for forensic analysis... - Sir. The knife's handle has Dr. Sachin Mahajan's fingerprints on it. And - the victim Ayesha Mahajan's fingerprints too... That proves there was a struggle between them. Does the blade have blood-stains? No. ...only the handle has fingerprints, right? Yes. That means someone washed the blade holding the handle? Possible. The cut on Ayesha's neck - - could that cut have been made with this surgical knife? Yes, it's possible. Alright. Fresh after a bath, Chotelal? So...? Sir...l... ...I fell asleep... You fall asleep everyday at 1 .30 a.m... ...and you continue napping till 5 a.m., don't you? Sir... ...I work elsewhere in the day, I get tired, so I fall asleep sir... What time do you assume duty? Sir, 10 p.m... What do you do between 10 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.? Sir, I am on duty, sir... And you don't visit the loo? When you got to go, you got to go. Right? So, 3 minutes to go, 3 minutes to come back... ...and how long does it take for you...to do it...? Sir, 2 minutes or so... That's it? ...and then you smoke, right? No way, sir... - Then what are these...'candles'? I smoke sir... - So you smoke... The building's staff toilet... ...was filled with your 'candles' this evening... So, that night, some person may have entered or exited the building... ...and you may have not seen him... ...coming or going out. Right? Yes, sir... You'll be saying this in court I'm terribly sorry... ...you had to wait... ...I'm Dr. Hansal... ...I was caught up in a delicate surgery... ...it took more time than expected...sorry. No issues. You're a head surgeon after all. You guessed it right. Matters of the heart are delicate. I just hope... ...you never ever require my services... My head is fine... ...but my brain gets a little messed up, sometimes... I completely understand... ...my patients go mad too... ...after they hear my fee... I can see that. Well... ...I manage to earn my bread and butter... What will you have? - That's Dr. Sachin Mahajan's apartment. Isn't it? That's Ayesha's bedroom window. If the curtains were open... ...one could see who's coming in there, or going out. What do you say? Brinda... You two haven't met... That's my wife, Brinda... Brinda, this is... - Paraskar... Sunil Paraskar from the C.B.l... I'll see you later... I've seen you before, on T.V.? Brinda has been an actress and model... ...but that was before she met me. Isn't that right, sweetheart? Yes. Why don't you sit down? How was your relation with Dr. Sachin...? Doctor? He's one of my good friends. In fact, he's close to me. And to you, Mrs. Brinda? I hardly know him. To me, he is...you could say... ...an acquaintance. I see... These are... ...Dr. Mahajan's call records. You've called him forty-five times... ...in the last two months. We're good friends... And did you... ...know about their 'friendship', doctor? Dr. Hansal...? No... ...not really... You're a bigger liar than your wife. Mr. Paraskar... I must ask you to leave now. May I ask you to shut up now? I'm not here on a social visit. Hansal, I'll see you later. Sit down. Ma'am, sit down. On the 28th of August... ...Mrs. Brinda... ...you called Sachin in the evening... ...and then you called the hotel Meridian. I was at the Meridian this morning. Brinda Chhabria. She last booked a room with us on 28th August. Had she come with this gentlemen? No sir... ...not with him. In fact, this gentleman... ...had come here inquiring about her, just like you. Do you have a booking in the name of... ...Brinda Chhabria? Yes, Brinda Chhabria... Had Brinda come alone? No, sir. Another gentleman had joined her... ...he often comes here with her. Was it him? Yes, sir. It was him... Was there any confrontation between these two men? No sir, I don't think they spoke to each other... How are you so sure? You remember everything in such detail... Sir, I remember because... ...that clay this gentleman had a brawl in the lobby, with a young lad. Our staff had to stop them. Show me the list of all reservations you booked that day. That day, we had... Mr. Vijay Sharma, Mr. Pradeep Singh Chauhan... ...Mr. Riyaz Noorani... - Riyaz Noorani... Who was he with? A girl in her teens. Was it her? Yes, sir...it was her. Good morning sir...how may I help you? I want to book a room... Yes, sir. At the same time... ...this gentleman was waiting for the elevator in the lobby... ...and... Dad.. What's happening? Dad...? What the hell are you doing with this guy? One second, let me explain... Riyaz...Stop! Dad! Riyaz, please don't... lam sorry dad, leave him... Dad! Please stop! Dad, stop it! Please stop! How dare you touch me? I'll get you, you bastard! Who the hell do you think you are...? Sir...please sir...relax...don't... And then... ...he took the girl away. And the other gentleman... ...left silently too. Mr. Paraskar... These are our personal matters... If you could... ...shield us from the public eye... ...we'd reward you appropriately. According to Dr. Sachin Mahajan's call records... Are you hinting at a bribe? No. Me? When? You just did... When did I say that? I was trying to say something else, that... Oh, so I misunderstood? Yes, there's been a misunderstanding... Oh, 0k... So, as per the call records... ...you called Dr. Sachin Mahajan at 11 p.m. that night... So...? He's a good friend... ...I call him often... ...what's wrong in that? Right... And quite a friend he's been... ...right, Mrs. Brinda? You have no right to insult my wife... After dropping Ayesha home... Sachin Mahajan left again... ...for hotel Meridian... ...where Brinda was waiting for him. Get in... You're never going to meet that boy again... Is that bloody clear...? Hey...it's been two hours... I know, I know... - ...you didn't even bother to call me... I'm really sorry. And then, at 11 p.m., Riyaz Noorani... ...came to meet Ayesha Mahajan at her apartment. I don't want to listen to you. Ayesha... He's my dad! How could you hit him Riyaz? Ayesha, I'm here only for you... And it's possible that at that time, you might have seen Riyaz... ...entering Ayesha's room, from here... That's it... You got the perfect opportunity... ...to repay your 'friend'... Hello... Hello, Sachin! ...where are you? I'm with a patient...what's the matter? That Muslim boy... Noorani... He's inside Ayesha's bedroom at the moment... What? - Yes. I just saw him with my own eyes. What shit are you talking about? Listen, I'm coming there... - What happened? I need to go. - What happened? ...I'll be back, Brinda. That's enough, Mr. Paraskar! What are you trying to prove!? You'll find out, in court, Dr. Hansal... Bye. Parvez... - Yes, sir... Hansal or Brinda? - You got them both by their tails, sir... Which of them has a motive? Both. Hansal could have done it to get even with Sachin. Or Brinda could have done it... ...because she may be wanting to marry Sachin... ...and he might be refusing for Ayesha's sake. Either of them could have paid someone to get this done... Someone like...Chetan Tiwari... ...or even Remi. I spent more time with Ayesha than her mother. When was Dr. Aarti ever at home? Your quarter is right below Ayesha's room, right? Yes. - Yet, you didn't hear anything that night? Actually, I'd heard something... A very faint noise... It was like someone was moving the furniture upstairs. But then, the noise stopped. So I went back to sleep. Alright, Mrs. Remi Fernandes... Inform Dr. Aarti that I'm here to see her... Am I through? - Yes. Sir... ...one request. I am not 'Mrs.'... ...just 'Miss'... OK... ...'Miss' Remi Fernandes... How old are these reports? I'd taken them the last time I came... It's been four months... The C.B.l. is here. Ask them to wait. I'll see them in a minute. I've resumed work... ...to dived my mind, but... ...it keeps coming back to me... Apart from your family, who else had the keys to your house? One set is with Remi... And another set of keys is with Dr. Hansal Chhabria... ...we'd kept a spare set with him in case of emergencies. What do you think of Hansal and Brinda? Hansal and Sachin are good friends... And... ...Brinda? No comments, eh? I don't like her... Oh... Did you know about Ayesha and Riyaz? No. Sir, Riyaz was overly possessive about Ayesha. He'd often threatened her... I don't give a shit what your parents think of me, Ayesha! The next time you speak of breaking up... ...I'll kill you. Got it? Sir, he dropped out of college, he's a hooligan...a goon. Did you know about this? Sachin had mentioned that Riyaz and his friends... ...weren't good company. Hey skin-head...next weekend... ...we're going to Lonavala...alright? No, let's go to Goa instead... - No dude...Lonavala. No, Goa... Let's try Alibaug . No, Lonavala will be more fun... Alibaug guys... Who's that!? She makes my heart go ga-ga! 'Ga-ga'...? Parvez... ...round them up... What have we done? Sir? Sir... Sir... ...you can't do this. We know the law, you can't touch us... ...we're entitled to call for a lawyer... Sir! Please sir... ...please let me go... Have you acted before? Sir? 'Acting'...have you acted before? No. What oozes out when one gets beaten? Sir... Not from down there, from up here... One screams, sir... Yes. So, scream as loud as you can... ...or else you'll get it for real... No! Sir please! No! Sir please! No! No! Sir please! Sir please! No! Sir please! No! Yes, now... ...tell me about the law... Sir...Riyaz wanted to elope with Ayesha. He'd planned it out with us... But Ayesha refused consistently. We know nothing else, sir... We don't know anything else, sir... We don't know where he is now...we haven't heard from him... We don't know. We don't know where he is now... He hasn't contacted us since then, sir... ...we are telling the truth, sir... I swear... Wow, sir! That was too cool! You screwed them inside out. Thank you so much sir, for letting me act... Aah, been a while since I've done that... ...enjoyed it thoroughly... Let's have lunch? Yes, sir. - Stan. It's possible that Riyaz killed Ayesha. Or maybe he got her killed by Chetan Tiwari. What could be the motive, sir? Possessiveness. What's your lunch? Egg sandwich? Same old dish. Ayesha may have insisted on ending their relation that night... ...that could have triggered him off... Sir, we'll know the truth once we nab Chetan Tiwari. Chetan's brother-in-law. . . Sudhakar Mishra. Keep an eye on him. Sir... ...he's left his place, like every night, he's carrying a bag as usual. Sir! Kanheri caves? Kanheri caves? Where did he want to go? Borivali National Park... Kanheri caves. Sir, I'm at Kanheri caves... Sir, he's ahead of me... Tell me... - Sir, he's right ahead of me... I can see him. Conceal yourself... Don't stop him. Let him pass. I want to see who's he feeding? Okay, sir. Yeah, Parvez... Yes, sir...did you see someone? There were two of them... ...they got away... But sir, who were they? Open the tiffin box. Taste it. - Sir... Don't worn], we're in a hospital. What is it? It's beef, sir. Would Chetan 'Tiwari', a Hindu Brahmin eat beef? Not possible, sir. Are you done? One second, sir... - Get lost! Will you operate on me next? Show me the knife... A butcher's blade... No fingerprints, I'm sure. The handle is covered by cloth. No, sir. Clever. Cloth handle with an uneven surface, impossible to extract fingerprints. But sir, who do you think was inside the caves? Riyaz Noorani? And who was... ...the other man who attacked you? Chetan Tiwari? He might have gone to meet Riyaz... Sudhakar Mishra will give us all the answers. Take him in custody, now. Sir... ...we received a call. Saying what? Sudhakar has not reached home. Did he fall off a moving train? Yes sir, it seems he fell off a moving train... Did you find a tiffin box, near his body? Tiffin...? You're from Mumbai, right? - Yes, sir. Don't you know what a tiffin box is? Hey, was there a tiffin box next to this body? No sir, we didn't find any tiffin box next to the body. Sunil... - Hmm... This cut... What about it? Sunil, anything could have happened... It's nothing...just a scratch... Are you done, nurse Asha? I'm really sorry. 30ml" Didn't Hansal Chhabria offer you something? Yeah, so? Why don't you accept the offer? Get aside...! Sunil... Sunil... To tell you the truth... ...you are the most selfish person I've met. Your ego means more to you than your children. This whole fracas is an ego trip for you. You care a damn for your family! Hello...Riyaz... Your mother is worried sick... ...she's asking you to come back home... ...forget all this now... ...just come back. Listen... I'm speaking to you because your mom told me to... Do you know the C.B.l. had rounded us up? This is getting serious now...so just come back while you still can... ...hello...hello... Take him away... Parvez...! Tell me! What happened in the apartment that night!? Sir, I'm sure... Chetan Tiwari and Riyaz are hand-in-glove. Sir... Riyaz Noorani has been located. Sudhakar Mishra's house... Open it. Pick this up... Silver. Sir, if you recall... ...Dr. Sachin had silver cutlery at his house too. Come... Chetan pocketed these spoons from here. But then, if Chetan took away meagre belongings... ...like his toothbrush, comb, etc... Why would he leave behind a silver spoon in Sudhakar's house? Maybe for safekeeping, maybe he just didn't get the time. The evidence is in this house. Think Parvez, think hard! Sir... Parvez... ...come, sit... Oh! Sorry... This pair, sir? Yes... Male...size 7... They are Chetan's, for sure... Obviously, Remi wouldn't wear these... When he ran off with everything... ...why did he leave his shoes behind? Come... Chetan's room...? - Yes, that one sir... Servant's bathroom? - That one sir... Go upstairs...enter Ayesha's room and come out. Quick! Parvez... Sir... Rem's quarter is below this, right? Yes, sir. Right below this. Actually, I'd heard something... ...like someone was moving the furniture upstairs... ...a very faint noise... Move the furniture from this spot... Get a screwdriver... Chetan's toothbrush, comb and everything else is right here. I want you to fight Dr. Sachin Mahajan's case... You see... I'm almost retired now. I take up only select cases. I can't take this case. I'm sorry. Mr. Ajwani, you've rarely ever lost a case in your career. This case really needs your expertise. Please reconsider... Mrs. Brinda... I am really sorry. Please... Please... This is a classic case of a frame-up, your honour. The scratches found on Dr. Sachin Mahajan's... ...and Ayesha Mahajan's bodies... ...prove that there was a struggle between them. That does not prove... ...that Dr. Sachin Mahajan... ...murdered Ayesha. Dr. Sachin Mahajan is Ayesha's father. That night, he might have beaten her up, to discipline her. And in that struggle... ...they could have scratched each other with their nails. And it's possible... ...that some third person may have seen them... ...and taken advantage. The blood reports have established... ...that Dr. Sachin Mahajan was heavily drunk that night. This is a carefully planned double murder... ...not an act of drunken impulse. It's impossible that a heavily drunk Dr. Sachin could've done it. Dr. Sachin Mahajan is granted anticipatory bail. Give me the bag... - No, I'm fine... Aarti, I've been waiting to tell you this since years... One second... - Just listen... Please, Aarti. I was concerned about Ayesha... ...it would affect her mind, her studies... ...custody cases have an adverse effect on kids. But now, I think... ...there's no point in continuing... ...this mechanical marriage of ours... You and Brinda...? Yes... Since a long time...right? It's not what you think... She's taking you for a ride... - No, she's not, that's not true... She's trying to... - Can you just take her away Remi, please? No...just listen to me, Sachin... We'll talk about this but not here... ...don't create a scene here! Listen to me, Sachin... She's taking you for a ride... - we'll talk about it... Sachin, just listen to me... She's taking you for a ride Goddamnit! We've spent so much time here. I have a surprise for you. Go in. Home...? For a few days, this hotel suite will be our home. Excuse me, ma'am... I'm Sachin's friend...Mahesh Limaye. Oh... I'd come here from Mumbai, for some work... ...Sachin sent these sweets for you. Sweets? He didn't call me about this... Must have slipped his mind... Anyway...thank you, ma'am... Wait, come in, you can't just leave like this... No ma'am, it's perfectly fine... Have a cup of tea at least... No, ma'am, thanks a lot... - Come, son... OK... You haven't even tasted anything... No ma'am, thanks... - have something, at least... - I'll have this... ...it looks good... So, when are you visiting Mumbai next? Not sure... Sachin,Aarti, Remi, they talk about you all the time. What's the matter, ma'am? Is Mr. Mahajan not too fond of Remi? Curious, aren't you? Are you really Sachin's friend... ...or someone else? Now that you've figured it out, ...tell me about Ayesha's murder. By the way, my name is Paraskar... Sunil Paraskar from the C.B.l. We don't know anything. I don't understand you. Sachin is your son, Ayesha was your grand-daughter. They are not my family, ...yet, I was attacked. I could've been killed. My wife pesters me day and night to accept bribes... She's worried that if I die... ...how'll she support the kids? Anyway, thanks for the tea. These sweets are good. Please do taste them. We don't know what happened there. But, beware of that woman Remi... ...she's capable of anything. Parvez... Yes, sir... Were you on Sudhakar Mishra's tail on the night of 18th Oct? Yes, sir. Repeat all that you saw at Borivali station. Why sir? Was my pop sipping lemonade there? Oh yes...Remi...Remi Fernandes... Call her for an interrogation, now. Ok, sir. Where were you on the night of 18th October? 18th October... I don't know sir... Who was sipping lemonade at Borivali station then? Borivali station? I must have gone to meet my mother... Where does your mother stay? Vasai... So, what were you doing at Borivali station then? Came to drink lemonade, eh? No... There's no direct train to Vasai. Sol change trains at Borivali station. Remi Fernandes... Sir...please... Where's Mr. Fernandes? There's no Mr. Fernandes... ...I'm not married... Any affair? Any affair? No, sir... Why are you joking sir? Am I joking? Am I joking!? No...no... I'm sorry, sir... I've not done anything... I swear on God and cross my heart I've not done anything... sir...please... Take her for a complete medical check-up, now! Please, sir... Come... - Sir, please... Come... - Please... Sir, please... - Come... Sir... This woman is sexually active. She has even given birth, at least once. When did your daughter Remi visit you last? Tell me... When was the last time Remi came to meet you? She does not remember. She's got alzheimer's. She can't remember much. Remi's husband does not let her come here... What is she saying? She's saying that... ...Remi's husband does not allow Remi to come here. Remi's 'husband'? Yes. Ma'am... What's Remi's husband's name? He's asking you... What's Remi's husband's name? What's Remi's husband's name? She doesn't remember. If you could ask her one more time, please... I'm sorry, it's her time to rest... ...we can't risk stressing her out too much. Have you ever seen Remi's husband? No. Remi was very beautiful when she was young... She says... Remi was very beautiful in her youth... Yes, sir. Tell me... Sachin's phone is not reachable, where is he right now? Sir, he's moved with Brinda to the hotel Meridian. Take your team and reach Meridian quickly, now! Sir? What's the matter? Sachin could be in danger, get there now, fast! Ok, sir. We were at the lobby... ...when the room service person called us from this suite... Sir, he's killed himself. Out of guilt, probably. Did anyone ask for a duplicate swipe card? No sir. No chance. We are very strict about that. Parvez... Sir... Assemble all of them inside Dr. Sachin's apartment... ...tomorrow, first thing in the morning. Alright sir, I'll do it. The 28th of August, Dr. Sachin Mahajan, drunk to the bone... ...reached his apartment at midnight... Dad? Dad? Dad? Ayesha wait, I'll explain... Sir, we were trying to sort things out... Dad! Dad! Dad! No! Please! Dad! Dr. Sachin Mahajan genuinely did not remember... ...whatever happened after that. Dad... Dad... Is there blood? There's no blood... It's a swelling... 30ml" At that time... Remi and Chetan... ...were fast asleep inside their respective quarters. Careful, Riyaz... Careful... - Keep your calm... I just hope dad doesn't remember all this tomorrow... Whenever he drinks too much... ...he doesn't remember much the next day... Let's hope he doesn't remember this... Ayesha, the knife... Oh, shit...come... Just pick it up... Alright, just leave now... - I'm leaving, you take care... I think Hansal would be able to tell us what happened next... That's right. I did call Sachin to tell him about Riyaz. I wanted to get back at Sachin. But I did not kill that cute little girl... Why would l...? But... I know who killed her... Who? Your beautiful wife... I mean ex-wife, Brinda? Brinda doesn't have the guts to do this sort of thing... Do you, Brinda? Then, who do you think did it? This woman! Wrong! How can a mother kill her own child? How can a mother kill her own child? Am I right? You were in a relation with Sachin, since an early age... Sir...? A physical relation... Sir, please... Sir... And this relation continued till you both were grown up... No, sir. - Right. Sir, please... No, ma'am... You could never be Mrs. Sachin Mahajan... ...so you settled with being Mrs. Remi Mahajan, didn't you? I won't use the word 'mistress' or 'keep'... Sir, please... Since I really respect women... No, no, don't get me wrong Remi... ...I'm saying, you really loved Sachin... Please...l beg you... You loved him so much that you could have done anything for him... That's why he kept you with him, didn't he? Please... And then, one day, you gave him some 'good' news... Sachin had to say it just once... ...and she would have aborted the child without a question. But, Sachin didn't do that... Because, after three years of marriage... ...he knew by now that his wife Aani... ...cannot give birth. She's infertile. I'm sorry... I confirmed this through the gynaecologists... ...in Ahmedabad... Are you the family physician for the Mahajan's? I have a few questions for you... You visited these gynaecologists for treatment, didn't you? All this is irrelevant! - Alright. Coming back to the stow... Sachin then sent... ...Remi away to her mother's house in Goa... ...where Remi gave birth to a beautiful little baby girl... ...Ayesha. Next, Sachin convinced Aani... ...that he's adopting a baby girl from an orphanage... Aarti agreed... This is Ayesha's birth certificate, from the birth registry office... It's fake. Then, when Sachin started a clinic here... ...he called Remi back to Mumbai and employed her as a nurse. I am Remi. - Come in. You may wonder now, - How did Aarti not know this...? I'm sure she must have suspected it... But, Sachin Mahajan was a seasoned player... ...he successfully convinced Aarti otherwise. But then, one day after eighteen years... ...Aarti finally saw Remi and Sachin together... Isn't that right, Aarti ma'am? Why are you doing this? Haven't we suffered enough? Why are you humiliating us so? Weren't you in Pune, that night? What? Weren't you in Pune on the night of the murder? Yes... That's where I'm a bit confused. The operation that you were called for... ...the amputation... ...was over before you reached the hospital. Since it was an emergency... ...a junior doctor had executed the operation, in your place. Operation records from Bhagwati Hospital, Pune... ...the doctor's name, the time of the operation, etc... - I reached a bit late... Right. And this... ...the taxi service... ...that dropped you here at your doorstep at 11 :45 p.m. You were here, weren't you? You reached here at eleven forty-five... How is this relevant? What has it got to do with anything? You tell us - how's it relevant? What are you trying to say? What the hell are you trying to say? If all this is not relevant... ...then why the hell are you getting worked up? What? No one knew that Aarti had reached home... Dr. Sachin Mahajan, drunk to the bone... ...reached his apartment at midnight... And then... Careful, Riyaz...please be careful... Keep your calm...I'm doing it right... Careful, please... Riyaz, please, go now... I'm going... - Leave now, please... Just leave now, please... - I'm leaving, you take care... This was the best opportunity Aarti'd ever get... ...to get even with Sachin and his family. Why are we even listening to this man's gibberish? And then, Aani... Bullshit! You accused Sachin earlier, And now me! You know what? Just get out of my house... Just get out! Just get out of here... Just get out of here... - Ma'am, please calm down... What the hell are you doing? - What's he trying to do? Ma'am, it's a C.B.l. inquiry... - What are you doing? Ma'am, it's a C.B.l. inquiry... Please, stay calm. Ma'am, please... Please, sit down... Carry on your discourse, Mr. Paraskar... Actually, it slipped my mind... ...how would you explain Chetan's death? Inspector Malwade? You've begun taking this madman seriously? When Aarti emerged from Ayesha's room after killing her... ...Chetan may have stepped out of his room too... ...maybe to use the loo. That's when... ...he might have seen her. Anything...just anything! Anything... Then, you struck a deal with Chetan. Did you not strike a deal? Careful. Mr. Paraskar, with all due respect to your experience in the C.B.l... ...your theory here is completely wrong. This could not have been the work of a delicate lady. It's impossible. Dr. Aarti Mahajan... ...is an orthopaedic surgeon. She amputates human limbs - arms, legs... ...clean, precise... ...with her skilled, trained and strong hands. So? Like this... Hey! Do not try that again. And with these strong, trained hands... ...she concealed Chetan's body below the floorboards. And then, at 1:30 a.m., when... ...the security guard had fallen asleep, she silently made her exit. Aarti knew... ...that Chetan's body would be discovered soon... ...and that's exactly what she wanted. So that the noose gets tighter around Sachin's neck. In the morning... ...Remi saw Ayesha's body... Sir...! Remi woke Sachin up, They wept bitterly for their child, and then... ...in a hasty attempt to protect Sachin... ...Remi tried to dispose his blood-stained shin off... Finally... It was time for Aarti's final vendetta. The lock of that hotel suite was neither forced... ...nor damaged nor tampered with. The only logical explanation, for the killer to have got in, is... ...that Sachin invited the killer in, himself. You'd visited Sachin at the hotel... ...with the divorce papers, right? Then who killed my son Riyaz? And, sir... ...who killed poor old Sudhakar Mishra? He did. Aani had bought off Malwade, right at the beginning. Riyaz contacted you, as soon as he heard of Ayesha's death. Ayesha's dad has killed her... ...I want to kill him, with my own hands. But, by then... ...Mr. Malwade had been bought over... There's this young guy, Riyaz. He says - Sachin has killed Ayesha. He wants to kill Sachin with his own hands. What do we do with him? Control him for now. Tell him that this is not the right time. If the law does not convict Sachin... ...then we'll use this boy. If the law failed to punish Sachin... ...Aarti would've used Riyaz to punish him. You were present at the scene of crime at the time of the murder. And there's a deep gash on your arm. The defense lawyer could put the blame of the murder on you. It's best that you go underground for some time now. If Sachin is convicted, then you can come forth and give a statement. If he gets out on bail, you can kill him. Malwade then pressurized Sudhakar Mishra... ...into delivering food to Riyaz. Do you wish to come clean from this case? Yes sir, please. - Then do as I say. One day, Malwade visited Kanheri caves to check on Riyaz. But instead, he saw that... ...Parvez and I had tracked down this hideout by trailing Sudhakar Mishra. So, he attacked me... Since we'd seen Sudhakar Mishra coming there... ...you killed him off too. You picked up the tiffin box from the tracks... ...since it had Riyaz's fingerprints. I still managed to deduce that it was Riyaz holed up at the caves. It's beef, sir. Had Riyaz opened his mouth to the C.B.l... Tell me! What happened in the apartment that night!? ...your game was up, so you... Mr. Malwade, thanks for... You bastard! You killed my only son! I won't spare you! I'll bury you with your uniform... I'll finish you and your family! Let go of me! Let me at him! Get lost... You have no evidence, Mr. Paraskar. You have no evidence. You are my evidence. Take him away! Hey, take him away! Yes sir. Come on, get him. You can't touch an officer in uniform! Come on, move! I'll fix you guys... I found an old photograph of Remi at her mother's place. In an 18-year old Remi's face, I saw an 18-year old Ayesha. And that's when all the little pieces of this mystery fell in place.
