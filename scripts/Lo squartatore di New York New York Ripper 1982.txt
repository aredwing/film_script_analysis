[BANGING] THE DOOR. DID YOU HAVE TO BREAK DOWN THE DOOR WHEN YOU GOT HERE? NO, IT WAS OPEN. WHY? NO, NO, NO, DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM. GET UP. McNAB, I WANT YOU TO ESCOR THESE TWO MEN OUT OF HERE NOW. OH, COME ON. LET ME READ THE WITNESSES. YOU KNOW, DUE DILIGENCE. SPENCER, WE DID THE DUE DILIGENCE. IT WAS A SUICIDE. THERE IS NO CRIME. THERE ARE NO WITNESSES. YOU'RE WRONG. THERE IS A WITNESS.

WHAT CHOICE DID I HAVE? PLUS THIS CA IS THE LEAD WITNESS IN A MAJOR MURDER INVESTIGATION. YOU WANT TO HOLD HIM? OH, NO, YOU DON'T. YOU TOOK THE CAT, YOU CARRY IT. WE'RE RIGHT ON THIS THING NOW. I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING SUBANTIAL. A STEAK? THE CHAIN THE DOOR? A STAIN ON THE CARPET? I WOULDN'T HE BELIEVED ME. WE NEEDED AN "IN," NOW WE HAVE ONE, PLUS HE CLEARLY LIKES YOU. GIVE HIM A SNUGGLE. YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO ENJOY THIS, YOU HAVING TO CARRY THIS CAT AROUND, PRETENDING YOU CAN COMMUNICATE WITH IT. I'M BUYING A DISPOSABLE CAMERA FOR WHEN YOU HAVE TO CLEAN OU HIS DIRTY LITTER BOX. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THIS CAT HERE IS A GIFT, A CONDUIT FOR US TO SAVE LIVES, AND HE HAS MORE TEGRITY IN HIS LITTLE FURRY HAND... PAW. PAW, THAN MOST PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR WHOLE... APPENDAGES... APPENDAGES. WHAT? ALL OF... THAN MT PEOPLE HAVE IN ALL OF THEIR APPENDAGES... COMBINED. OH YEAH? I THINK HE WANTS TO SLEEP ON YOUR CHAIR. HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THIS UP FOR? UNTIL WE SOLVE THE CRIME.

I'M JUST SAYING I CAN KINDA GE WHERE LASSITER IS COMING FROM. A FEW SUICIDES IS NOT UNCOMMON. GUS, DID YOU LOOK AT THE SKY TODAY? BLUE, CLEAR... AND DID YOU FEEL I OUT THERE? WARM. NICE. STATISTICALLY, PEOPLE IN MILD CLIMAS ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO KILL THEMSELVES. NOW, IF WE WERE IN VLADIVOSTOK, WE COULD TALK. THE POINT IS, AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS WAS A 50-YEAR-OAN LIVING ALONE WITH A CAT. OH. OH. DO YOU WANT DOWN? YOU CAN GET DOWN. YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. I KNOW I'M RIGHT. IT'S PROBABLY A SUICIDE. THANK YOU. THAT WAS BIG OF YOU TO ADMIT. I'M UNCLEAR ON ONE LITTLE THING. WHAT'S THAT? HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THE SECOND BODY THEY JUST FOUND? DETECTIVE O'HARA. WELL, YOU'RE HERE ALL BY YOURSELF? AH. DAMN IT ALL. COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ANYBODY. TALK TO ME. WELL, VICTIM IS A FEMALE IN HER LATE 20s, GLORIA STARKS. WE'RE WAITING FOR FORENSICS TO CONFIRM, BUT IT APPEARS TO BE A SUICIDE. CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING. ASPHYXIATION. OOH, I'M AFRAID THE CAT DOESN'T THINK SO. TURN AROUND AND WALK AWAY. THIS CAT CAN TELL US IF THE KILLER HAS BEEN HERE. ALL I NEED IS 30 SECONDS. WATCH THIS. YOU READY, BOY? HUH? YOU READY? WHAT? WHAT, OVER HERE? WHERE? WHAT... THAT IS-- THAT IS VERY THOUGHTFUL. I'LL TELL HIM. HE SAYS THE FAC THAT YOU TAKE THREE CREAMS AND FOUR SUGARS IN YOUR COFFEE? DANGEROUS. IS THAT TRUE? DO YOU REALLY TAKE THREE CREAMS AND FOUR SUGARS? SO WHAT? THAT IS A HEART ATTACK WAITING TO HAPPEN. YOU'RE STILL A YOUNG MAN. THAT WAS AMAZING. HOW DID YOU DO THAT? IT WAS A LUCKY GUESS. DON'T YOU GET TIRED OF SAYING THAT? WITH YOUR PERMISSION, I'D LIKE THE LITTLE BOY CA TO SNIFF OUT THE CAR. ABSOLUTELY NOT. OOPS! WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

NICE KITTY. YES, DID YOU MAKE GOOD PEE-PEE? DID YOU MAKE GOOD PEE-PEE? YES, YOU DID. WHAT? THAT'S--THAT'S A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE. I'M SORRY, THAT'S RUDE. HE WAS JUST SAYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING IF HE'D KILLED HIMSELF. HE WOULD HAVE SWUNG BY THE DRY CLEANER'S AND GRABBED THE PANTSUIT FIRST. MAYBE SHE PICKED UP THE DRY CLEANING DAYS AGO. DID THE CAT EVER THINK OF THAT? WHAT IS HE DOING RIGHT HERE? HE IS MEASURING THE AMOUN OF CARBON MONOXIDE EMITTED. OKAY. I KNEW THAT. [SHAWN]: YEAH, YOU DID. [STARTS ENGINE] [RADIO BLARES] WHOA! NOW, DOES SHE STRIKE YOU AS THE TYPE THAT WOULD GO FOR HEAVY METAL? ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE COULD HAVE CHANGED HER RADIO STATION. MR.

I HAVE NO IDEA, BUT I SEE IT ON NUMB3RS ALL THE TIME, AND IT SEEMS TO WORK FOR THEM. YOU READY TO GIVE UP? FOUR SEPARATE SUICIDES, TWO OF WHICH OCCURRED BEFORE WE CAME ON THE CASE, AND I DON'T SEE A PATTERN OF ANY KIND. DIFFERENT AGES, DIFFERENT SEXES. DIFFERENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC LEVELS. DIFFERENT METHODS OF DEATH. NO DUPLICATE WEAPONS, LOCATIONS. WHAT DO WE GOT? FIRST WE HAVE A JUMPER, SECOND, AN OVEN, THIRD, PILLS, FOURTH, CARBON MONOXIDE. THEY ALL HAVE TO BE CONNECTED SOMEHOW. WHAT I SEE IS A WHOLE LOT OF NOTHING. NOTHING. YOU SEE, SOMETIMES, SHAWN, YOU DON'T NEED TO DIG SO DEEP. YOU JUST NEED TO TURN THINGS UPSIDE DOWN... TO MAKE THEM RIGHT-SIDE UP. AND THERE'S YOUR PRIZE. WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M TURNING THINGS UPSIDE DOWN IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM RIGHT-SIDE UP. AND THERE'S THE PRIZE. [GUS]: THIS IS THE PRIZE?

WHO IS HE? WELL, PUT IT THIS WAY. TAKING THE APARTMEN ISN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA, UNLESS YOU THINK IT'S COOL THAT OUR WOULD-BE LANDLORD IS A SERIAL KILLER. HILTONBOCK? THERE WAS A PATTERN. SEE, ALL THE MURDERS COINCIDE WITH DATES THAT HILTONBOCK WAS SERVICING THE PHONE LINES. THAT'S WHEN HE HAD ACCESS. WITH THIS? YES. YEAH, YEAH, SEND THAT DOWN. PERFECT! SEE, THIS DEVICE STORES ALL THE INCOMING AND OUTGOING CALLS. MY GUESS IS WHATEVER NUMBER HE DIALED LAST, THAT'S WHERE HILTONBOCK IS HEADED, AND WHOEVER THAT IS IS PROBABLY HIS NEXT VICTIM. [RINGING] HELLO, YOU'VE REACHED BUZZ McNAB. I'M NOT IN RIGHT NOW, BUT PLEASE DO LEAVE A MESSAGE, AND I WILL GET BACK TO YOU WHEN I GET IN. OH, NO. WHO ARE YOU CALLING? HELLO, CHIEF? HEY, UH, SHAWN SPENCER HERE. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. LOOK, I'M GETTING A VIBE RIGHT NOW AS BIG AS A BUICK. STAY, BOY CAT! HEY, McNAB. SO THIS IS THE PLACE, HUH? IT'S NICE. IT'S REALLY NICE. DROP IT! DON'T COME ANY CLOSER! I WILL DROP YOU! I SWEAR TO GOD I'M GOING TO SHOOT HIM! DROP IT! EVERYBODY, BREATHE. JUST BREATHE. GET OUT OF HERE. WOW, THE OTHER ONES MUST HAVE GONE A LOT SMOOTHER THAN THIS, HUH, HILTONBOCK? YEAH, COMPARATIVELY, IT WAS PROBABLY PRETTY EASY TO GET MORTIMER TILDEN TO SWALLOW THOSE PILLS. YOU WANT TO DIE, OLD MAN, HUH? EAT 'EM. BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT REALLY A COLD-BLOODED SERIAL KILLER, ARE YOU? HE ONLY THREW HIS OWN BROTHER OFF A BUILDING. I DIDN'T PUSH HIM OFF THE ROOF. NO, NO, NO, NO. NO, YOU DIDN'T. YOU DIDN'T DO THAT. BUT YOU WERE THERE. YOU SAW IT. YOU SAW THE WHOLE THING. YOU SAW HIM JUMP OFF THE BALCONY OF THE APARTMEN THAT YOU SHARED. HE WAS WEAK. THERE'S A LOT OF WEAK PEOPLE OUT THERE, HILTONBOCK. YOU GOING TO TRACK THEM ALL DOWN, HUH? ONE AT A TIME? PUNISH THEM FOR THEIR WEAKNESS? YOU WANT TO GET BACK AT YOUR BROTHER SO BADLY, YOU DON'T EVEN... YOU DON'T EVEN CARE WHO THESE PEOPLE WERE, JUST THAT THEY CALLED A LINE. LOOK, YOU WERE GOING TO KILL McNAB HERE JUST BECAUSE HE HAD A FEW PRE-WEDDING JITTERS. I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR A LITTLE ADVICE. NOBODY ELSE WOULD TALK TO ME. IT'S OKAY, BUZZ. WE ALL HAVE STRESS. ALL OF US. RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM. I MEAN, TAKE A GOOD LOOK, HILTONBOCK. WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS. WHO ELSE DESERVES TO GET SHOT OR HUNG? MAYBE IT'S GUS. THAT'S ENOUGH, SPENCER. OH, SHOOT HIM. WHAT ATE YOU DOING? YEAH, MAYBE I SHOULD. DON'T LISTEN TO HIM! HE'S A CRAZY PERSON. HE'S CRAZY. THAT'S RIGHT. I AM CRAZY. SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD SHOOT ME. OKAY. HERE'S THE BEST PART. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK, BECAUSE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM THAT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN ME... THIS GUY. THE MAN WITH HIS GUN TRAINED ON YOU IS NOT ONLY A FINE HUMAN BEING WITH A STRONG IRISH HAIRLINE, HE IS AN EXEMPLARY PUBLIC SERVANT, AND ARGUABLY THE FINEST DETECTIVE MIND IN THE LOWER WESTERN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AREA... OVER THE AGE OF 35, AND RIGHT NOW, WHILE I'M SPEAKING, HE IS DEVISING A SWIF AND STEALTH-LIKE TACTIC THAT IS GOING TO DISARM YOU... AND BLOW YOUR FREAKING MIND. ANY TIME YOU'RE READY. ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GO TO MAKE THE MOVE. OW! OW! OW! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. THAT WAS ADEQUATE, SPENCER. DON'T THANK ME. THANK THE LITTLE BOY CAT. OW! OW! THERE YOU ARE! THERE'S MY BIG GUY. THERE'S MY BIG GUY. YOU'RE A HERO! YOU'RE A HERO TODAY. YES. SPEAKING OF HEROES, McNAB, I WAS GOING TO GET YOU SOMETHING OFF THE REGISTRY ONLINE, BUT IT TURNS OUT THE CHIEF ALREADY GOT YOU THE ASPARAGUS STEAMER, SO... INSTEAD, I GIVE YOU THIS LITTLE GUY. YEAH. IF YOU TAKE HIM IN THE CAR, HE LIKES TO RIDE UP FRONT. SHOTGUN. Is something beatufull clolor ABOUT THE COLOR FRUITY PUFFS TURNS THE MILK. I THINK IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD. I'VE BEEN THINKING. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS A CHARMED LIFE, SHAWN. I'VE GOT I PRETTY GOOD TOO. YES, YOU DO, AND IT MAKES ME GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO. I MEAN, THE OTHER DAY AT WORK, THIS DERMATOLOGIST, KATIE FINESTATT, COMMENTED HOW I LOOKED HANDSOME CARRYING MY SAMPLE CASE INTO HER OFFICE. FINESTATT SAID THAT? YES, SHE DID. AND SHE IS FINE. SO IT GOT ME THINKING, MAYBE PHARMACEUTICAL SALES CAN BE SORT OF SEXY. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I HAVE TO STAND A FEW FEET AWAY BECAUSE YOU'RE LITERALLY SIZZLING. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? I MEAN, YOU MAY BE MY ONLY NON-WORK FRIEND. BUT YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND, AND HOW MANY BEST FRIENDS DOES ONE GUY NEED, REALLY? THAT'S MY POINT. IT'S ALL IN THE ATTITUDE, GUS. EXACTLY. NOT SWEATING THE SMALL STUFF. LIFE'S TOO SHORT. TOO SHORT. CHANGING MY ATTITUDE, SHAWN. WHERE THE HELL IS MY PRIZE? WHERE'S MY RING, SHAWN? EASY, NOW. NO, NO. I TIMED THE BOWLS OUT PERFECTLY, SHAWN. ME, THEN YOU, THEN ME, THEN YOU, THEN I GET THE PRIZE. SO WHAT HAPPENED TO NO SWEATING THE SMALL STUFF? LIFE'S TOO SHORT? ALL THAT? DID YOU OPEN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX? WHY WOULD I DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? THAT'S MY RING. HMM? YOU KNOW I WOULD KILL FOR THAT RING, DON'T YOU? UH, YOU'RE UPSETTING ME. YOU JUST CHANGED MY MOOD FROM AN ORANGEY YELLOW TO A MUDDY BROWN. YOU NEED TO SAY SOMETHING SWEET, QUICK. GUS... THAT'S SO CHILDISH AND... I'M GOING TO EAT YOURS.
