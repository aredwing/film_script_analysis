Please respond. Shit. Copy, control. Just have my foot stuck on the accelerator. This is not a joke, falcon. [Beeping] Mig 29s! Control: Their fighters are instructed to escort you back to American air space. Control, they're burnin' my ass. Request permission to break formation. Negative. Do not break formation. Keep it together, Doug. They're just messing with us. Control, they're moving in. Control, I have to break it. They have missile lock. Request permission to break formation. Control: Denied. Control! Got to break it now! Control: Do not break formation. Eject, Doug! Eject! Eject! You ok, bucky? What time is it? Well, it's late. Ok. I'll be out in a second. Hoo! You look like dog vomit, bucky. Well, that's the price of sobriety, I guess. Sure. Just get your wings on straight. [Music playing on walkman] Excuse me. [Humming] Hey! Hey! [Turns music off] Well, I keep telling you, this mixture's too lean... Just like you are. How'd you find me? Santoni. Told me where you were. Your friends care about you even if you don't. Yeah. Got a proposition for you. I'm not interested. I done retired from the air force. Yeah? I got a little flight school over at silver creek. Hey. And a handful of t-6s. T-6s? Those things are relics. Hey, you're a pilot. I figured I'd give you a chance to get back behind the stick. Amanda lets me fly her baby once in a while. I can get my fix without your charity. Look, the school's got some problems. I could use a flight instructor who knows what to do. I got a job. Being bitter is not a job, Doug. Good-bye, general. So, he wouldn't go for it, huh? Nah. Says he's already got a job. Well, wait here a minute. I'll go fire him. [Laughing] What'd I do? I mean... Damn it! Oh! No. They're gonna kill themselves up there. Just what kind of problems you talking about, chappy? [Grunts] Snyder! Snyder! Hey, snyder, how many times I tell you to keep those kids away from those planes? They offered to take me for a spin, sinclair, by tying me to a propeller. They're high-spirited, that's all. They're mutants. I'm gonna do something less stressful like become an air traffic controller. Snyder. Snyder... you the new dupe here? Let me give you some advice. Run away... far, far away. Wha... Doug, I need your help. Please. Look. Please. Hey. They couldn't do that the other day. See how they taxied over there? That's perfect. Remember how hard it was for you to do that? Look at that. Hey, that's pretty good. I'm impressed. Yeah, I know you're impressed. But look, they could not do that the other day. That's perfect. You guys are dead! Stay outta my way. Come on, Wheeler, take it easy, ok? Stay outta my way! What the hell's your problem? Girl: What are you doing? Next time you guys bounce me, I'll break your necks! Let's go have a beer. Wheeler! Dana! All right, everybody, listen up. Listen up there, kitty. This is Doug masters. Mr. Doug masters, the first freshman class of the iron eagles flight school. This is one here, this is Dana Osborne. She's a little pissed. Convicted 5 times of assault and battery. Last time, she took a baseball bat to the high school coach. After he dragged me into the locker room and made a slide for home. Kitty: Good girl. This here's Malcolm Porter. 24 counts of telephone fraud. Tried to sell shares of a bogus phone sex operation to the city council. Peter Kane. 24 counts... grand theft auto. Yeah. This one, that's Katherine Shaw. Keep trying to dream up laws against what you can do on a computer. Isn't that right, kitty? Hoarding information is a crime against us all. But selling it will get you 2 to 10 in the state pen. Shut up. This little guy here... Rudy marlowe. Tried to proposition a hooker. The only thing is, she was a lady vice cop. When he couldn't steal her heart, he stole her gun. What a stud, man! [Inhaling] Last, but not least, Ms. Wheeler here was a courier for the infamous Luther penrose. Drugs, counterfeit bills, weapons. Hey, what the hell? It's there to sell. My conscience is clear. It ain't never been used, baby. Watch your mouth, man. You don't be calling me baby. Oh, you don't like that? Don't like being a girl? So, there you have it... the freshman class. Mr. masters here is gonna be your flight instructor for the first combat trials. Combat trials? Chappy: Combat trials. Against some air force kids from the cardwell base next month. Next month? Huh! Like to talk to the class? Here we go. Talk to us, Dougie. When I was 9, I wanted to be 15. When I was 15, I wanted to be 21. Why? 'Cause I hate kids. Hey, hey. Hey, Doug. Hey, wait a minute. Come back here. You should've told me this was a flight school for delinquents. It's a motivational program. We use flying to hopefully teach them a little responsibility, a little discipline... A little self-worth. Still the patron Saint of lost causes, huh, chappy? You know, you got a kid in there who's a severe asthmatic? Eh, he's medically sound. It's just a security blanket. He aced his solo flight. Mm, that wasn't flying today. That was hot-dogging. It kinda reminds me of somebody I used to know. Hot-dogging will get them killed. Then help me pull it together. Forget it. At least stay until I can get a replacement. How long? A few days... Couple of weeks. Couple of weeks? Look, I'll give you a week, but that's it. I'm honored. Yeah. Hey, Doug. You really don't think this program is gonna work, do you? I really don't care. Russian man: What is your name? Captain Doug masters, United States air force. 5342991... 210... 49... How long... Can a man live without water? You know? 6... 7... 8 days, hmm? [Ring] Day-o  [rap rap rap] Day-o  daylight come, and me wanna go home  daylight come, and me wanna go home  day...  hey, cut it out. Cut it out. Everybody down to the flight deck now. Ok, Doug. Doug, I'm kinda new at this, man, ok? You gotta tell me what to do here. Doug. Huh? Ok, ok. Take it easy. Take it easy. What's the matter, can't take it, pops? You go up, and you're gonna go... And you're dead! [Imitating missile attack] Ok, how am I doing, man? I don't think that last one was too good. Is that all right? That's great. Oh! Oh! What? What the hell do you mean you can't find a replacement? Look, I promised Doug masters that I'll get him a replacement. Now you do the best you can and hurry up, all right? Man. [Chuckling] [Rhythm and blues plays] You're not supposed to smoke around the planes, you know. We'll just, uh, keep it our little secret, ok? I thought you'd be gone by now. Yeah? Where? I don't know. South. What's South? Mexico. Mm-hmm. What's in Mexico? It's a good place to live if you're a pilot. And if you're not too choosy who you work for. That's pretty slick. Good business sense. Got some good contacts. You look like you know how to handle yourself. Maybe you need a new start. New starts are where you find them. You believe that? No. You're one hell of an inspiration, fly boy. Don't nothin' turn your crank? You drinking to success? How are the kids coming? They ready for the competition? Absolutely. If the air force brats are flying kites. Look, Doug... chappy, the kids they're going up against live on an air force base. Their fathers are pilots. They've probably been in training since they were in diapers. Doug, you gotta give them some time. Rudy: Yeah, like you're an expert yourself. Wheeler: Don't get wise with me, ok? Peter: What's gonna happen, you gonna beat us up again? [Kids all arguing] Well, what do you know. Here's my little would-be angels. Get off our case, ok, wilcox? Why don't you save that kind of talk for your drug dealer? I'm just about one breath away from sending you all the way back to polsonville. Is that so? These little gangsters belong in jail, not in some bleeding-heart bullshit reform program. Say that to the governor, huh? And watch your language. The governor. Yeah. You're a friend of the governor, I suppose. That's right. Well, I tell you what I am. I'm here to check your security. You got 6 children here from the state youth authority. You so much as screw up once, I'll shut you down quicker than a moonshiner at a police picnic. Good-bye, sheriff. You understand that? Give my regards to your governor. Good-bye. See ya later. Come on, kids. Make your move now. Make your move. Fire. [Machine gun fire] Missed. Get behind him! Get on his tail! I can't. He's too fast. Come on! Give it to him! Go! Go! Go! He's behind us! Shake him! Shake him! I can't! Come on! Kitty, do something. Oh, no! P.A. Announcer: Outstanding marksmanship... general kettle's team. Your kids have improved a lot, chappy. Does that mean we can forget about that case of scotch? No. No one ever improves that much. Hey, chappy. That kid of yours is in trouble. [Engine droning in and out] Pull up, kitty! Pull up! Kitty, get us outta here! Come on! What are we doing? Oh, my God! P.A. Announcer: Just a little bit of stunt flying, folks. Nothing to worry about. Next we have the team of Wheeler and marlowe for the iron eagles versus Chuck sendak of the junior guns. We should be back at the competition, Wheeler. We're gonna let the eagles down. We got lots of time. I'll be in and out in 2 shakes. Keep the meter running. Hey, Luther. How's business? It grows painfully, like hemorrhoids. You have been scarce, Wheeler. I've been busy. 4 months in polsonville. Another 8 at that silly little flying school. Teaching drug couriers to be pilots. I got a deal for you. Ah. How much? 2 grand. Oh, you are very generous. I'm taking that plane to Mexico. I'm starting fresh, and I need a new stake. Should I have it tested? Absolutely. I like you, Wheeler. I will miss you. Sugar. White death. Kill the little snot rag. Get her! Back up. Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Come on! Rudy! Slow down! Slow down! Come on, Wheeler! What are you waiting for? Go! Go! How do you like that, Luther? You rat fink slime-sucking pig dog! Yes! We did it, Rudy. You and me, kid. You ever been to Mexico? What are you talking about, Mexico? We gotta go back. We got a competition to go to, Wheeler. Let's go. Well, nice of you and Mr. marlowe to put in an appearance, slick. It's duster Doug and his music to grow old and die by. I'm taking you back to the school, Wheeler. I want you glued to my ass the whole way. I got better things to do than being glued to your ass. You don't wanna try this with me, kid. Come on, duster, let's dance. Come on, Wheeler, you're gonna get us killed! Wheeler, you're gonna get us killed! Don't get any nearer the plane. You're gonna hit the other plane. Wheeler: Hey, duster, choke on my smoke. [Rudy moaning] That was easy. What's next? Ok, hot dog. Let's see how good you think you are. How'd you like that, duster? It's not bad. Not bad?! Not bad enough. Not bad. But not enough. Come on, Wheeler, just take us down. I'm losing it. Pull up, Wheeler! Pull up! Feel it out. Punch it. Now! You ok? Yeah. I'm ok. There's an abandoned air force base 3 Miles west of here. Set the plane down there and wait for me. Got it? Yeah, I got ya. Wheeler. Yeah? That was some good flying. Thanks. I think we've got it, sergeant. Major Pierce. We've uncovered it, sir! Sergeant osgood, get your men back. Captain, you have the codes. Sir! [Beeping] Fincher! We're clean, sergeant. No evidence of venting. Outstanding. Get them loaded. On 2! On 2! Let's move it! Let's move it! Incoming, sir. See to our security, captain. Yes, sir! I don't like this, Rudy. Cameron. Yes, sir. What the hell? Hey, guys, we thought this place was... 2 kids, sir. Shoot them. Captain? Do it. Yes, sir. [Airplane approaching] [Gun fires] Oh! Hang on! Hit the deck! Come on, make a run for it. Wheeler: We made it. We're up. Wheeler: They were going to kill us. Sarge, do we have an incident here? Clean, sarge. No breach. Major, should we inform prometheus of the attack, sir? Maintain radio silence. We're almost finished here, osgood. All right, let's move. Let's get these things loaded! [Beeping] Major Pierce, this canister's been activated, major. It's counting down from the 48-hour mark. Then I suggest we get a move on. We'll hand the canister over to Dr. gully as soon as you reach prometheus. That's 2 days... 2 days, major. Don't you think you're cutting it a little close? God transformed the face of creation in 6 days, sergeant. Now, surely the air force can improve on his record. You heard the major. Get this canister loaded! Where'd you find them? On the way to acapulco somewhere? How close are you and that air force general guy kettle? Why? Just call him. I'll explain later. Come on. Look at all this. It's all fresh sod. They came prepared. Paint, sir, from Doug's guns. Someone tried to hide it by raking up the grass. What's going on here, Brad? I don't know. Damn bureaucrats closed this place down a couple years ago. I need a secure line. I gotta make a call. Wheeler: Who are they? Chappy: Air force intelligence. General kettle. Ken, spying on your own side again I see. Perhaps you could explain the presence of civilians on a restricted base. This is brigadier general Charles sinclair. Sinclair... operation dark star. Right. You're retired. I know. And captain Douglas masters. Also retired. Captain masters and these young people flew over the base today and, uh, well, they saw something peculiar. There's a couple of your flyboys outside uncovering some kind of storage bunker? They're probably just recycling some old equipment. That's s.O.P. Is it also standard procedure to open up on civilian aircrafts with a 50-caliber machine gun? My team will investigate your claim. Sir, we should also secure the eyewitnesses for questioning. You mean detain them, huh? Wait a minute. Well, I hardly think that's necessary. General kettle, thank you for your help. Air force intelligence will take the investigation from here. Lieutenant mara? Sir. Escort Mr. sinclair and his party off the base. A canister? The bottom had these little flags on the bottom. And it had these, uh, letters stenciled on the side. It was t-x-c. Let me see that. I think I might know somebody who can tell me what these letters mean. Chappy: It's got these letters... t x c and it's got something, something, something, then it's got an "a." What? You sure? Wait. Thanks, Ronny. I'll talk to you later. What is it? T-x-c, it's prefixes for toxic biological agent. Oh, that's great. Chappy: Somebody's driving around with a truck full of chemical weapons? Sinclair and his people have just become a liability. You really are leaving, aren't you? In the morning. First I've ever heard of you running away from a fight. Hey, it's not my fight. Some fantasy of yours. Stealing 2 jets to rescue your father in the middle east, now that was a fantasy, but you made that happen. Not the Doug masters I remember. Hey, that Doug masters is dead! He died in a Soviet prison. He died while everyone else he knew got on with their lives. His parents retired, his girl got married. Oh, now all the reports said you were blown out of the air. All the reports were wrong! I waited, chappy. I waited for you to get me out. Then, finally, it was the politicians who stumbled across me. Did you press the Soviets? Did you try to verify those reports? Or were you too busy being promoted to general? Now, look, son... hey, I'm not your son. Look, I'm sorry if this Doug masters disappoints you. That's too bad. 'Cause you sure as hell had a hand in making him. Just give up on me, chappy. You've done it before. [Raining] Wheeler! I'm getting out of here, kid. I'm taking one of these planes and heading South. Wanna come with me? You can't just take off. I'm relocating in Mexico. It's the American way. They'll send everyone back to polsonville. Not my problem. Yes, it is. We discussed this last night. Grow up, Rudy! The only person you can trust in this world is you. If I can't trust you, then I can't go with you. Do you have some time for some coffee before you go? We don't have any sugar. We always seem to be out of sugar. Come out here to stop me? Who me? Can't stop masters from hating me. Can't stop this school from falling apart. Can't stop a single truck. What the hell makes you think I can stop you? Well, here they come. Captain wilcox. That's right. No time for coffee now, huh? Good luck, kid. All right, boys, go rouse those sleeping angels. Wilcox: Wakey-wakey. Wilcox: All right, rise and shine, boys and girls. Got something here for you. Chappy: What's up? Sinclair, I was talking to your old friend the governor about that Wheeler business and he wasn't too happy. As a matter of fact, there's nothing he can do for you. And I got myself an order here that's going to shut you down tighter than a drum. It stinks, but it's legal. Where is Wheeler? Wheeler? Well, I guess your guys let her get away, huh? I'll tell you this much, sinclair. If we don't find Wheeler, you're gonna end up working in one of my state-run programs. You got that? Let's move out. They're going to give your friend Wheeler a real hard time after she's caught. She ain't our friend. You haven't caught her yet. Now don't you worry, little man. Sooner or later, she's gonna run right into us. There she is! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! All right. Yes! Wheeler: Whoo! I'm coming for you, wilcox! [Machine gun fires] [Tires squeal] Yes! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Take it! Now, you'll go to jail. One move, and you'll be Mr. no-cock. Dana, yeah! Guess I'll go and try and get those kids back. You, uh, wanna ride? All right. Let's go. Let's hit it. Let's do it. Wilcox: Boy, your friend chappy, he must be real, real proud of you. This is a whole 'nother ball game, you know. Holding a police officer with his own gun. This is not a misdemeanor. This is a felony. I tell you, you might be laughing now, but in the end of this, you're going to have more charges against you than a sears credit card. All right, captain wilcox, you have a nice day now. Yeah, have a very nice day. Wilcox: Yeah, I'll have a nice day. I'll come to your college graduation. I know where it's gonna be... at a state prison. Yeah, ok, whatever. Ok, Rudy, what are we going to do now? Why don't we take the other planes? Peter: Ok, let's go. Let's turn it around and go back, ok? [Bus engine starts] We got roadblocks down there. Whoo! [Chappy laughs] Whoo! This is going to turn out to be a long, long day. Yeah! Whoo! Rudy: Wheeler! Wheeler, you came back! Chappy: You kids are fugitives now, huh? We're taking the planes, chappy. Yeah, where? Up. Time is something we don't have. We? Yeah, we. Rudy: You're coming with us? I sure the hell ain't gonna stay here. Look, you guys got... gimme those guns. You guys got 3 minutes to get the squadron up in the air. Hurry up. Now! Come on, guys! Have you completely lost it? Yeah, I have. Now's the time for me to get it back. You, too. Chappy: Coming? I can't do this. Hey, you know, Doug, I know how you feel about me. That's not it. No, wait a minute. Hear me out. I know how you feel about me, but these kids need some help to get through this. Now, please, please, please don't abandon them the way I abandoned you. Don't punish these kids like this. I'm not trying to punish them. I'm trying to keep them alive. Do you know why I was shot down? I tried so hard to convince myself that you were responsible. But that was just another way of ducking what I am. What are you, Doug? I know what I am. What? I'm a coward. A coward? I'm sorry. Hey, look, um... I made this tape for you last night. I was going to give it to you this morning... but I ran. Now, you can listen to this tape or not. It's up to you. How many planes in your squadron? I am p-4. 991-210-4963. What the hell is going on? They've escaped, sir, in their planes. I want them found, lieutenant. Right away, colonel. It's not like they can hide in a haystack. Chappy: We gotta camouflage these things really good so they can't see them from the sky, all right? All the planes. Mrs. kirke, you know, I really want to thank you. Well, my pleasure, general. Gets kind of boring around here after locust season anyway. You know, they look good. Yeah, they do. You and bucky really pulled them together. Listen, I'm sorry that he stalled out on you. [Airplane approaching] Plane! Oh, hold it. I think it's a t-6 engine. It must be Doug. I thought you'd come here. You forgot this. You know, you never cease to amaze me. Ok, so wait a minute. This air force colonel... birkett. Yeah, birkett. You figure he pulled a bunch of strings and got captain wilcox to come down to the school and close it down? That's right. Well, I mean it makes sense. They distract us with domestic authorities and then we don't know about the canisters. Question is what do we do now? We go after that convoy, miss Wheeler. How do you plan we do that, sir? By using the resources that we have at hand. Wheeler: What resources? All right, everybody at the table. Quick! Now, I'm going to divide ourselves into 3 teams... intelligence, supply, and recon. Now, myself, miss Shaw, and Mr. Kane will be the intelligence. It will be our job to infiltrate that air force base and find out all we can about those missing canisters. Miss Shaw? You're going to have an opportunity to play with some of those military computers. Yes, sir. Mr. marlowe, Mr. Porter, miss Osborne, you'll be our recon team. It'll be your job to locate that rogue convoy. Dana: How? Miss kirke, am I correct in assuming that there are a lot of crop dusters in this area? You are. Then locating that paint-splattered convoy shouldn't be all that difficult. Mr. Porter, as I remember, you have many, many counts of telephone fraud. Just give me an open line, sir, and I'll have every pilot in this state paying to help us. Which brings us to supply. Miss Wheeler. Sure, what do you need... potatoes, army boots? Guns... Bullets... Ammunition for our planes. As I recall, you worked for a man who trafficked in such material. And he's overstocked now because the Colombians all want helicopters. All right. We have to get to that convoy before the police and sheriff birkett get to us. Now, this isn't school anymore, people. This is real life. We can't go around protecting our own backs. We have to look after each other's back. Alone, we're dead. Now, as a team, we can't be stopped. Yes, sir, it's my dad on the convoy and he doesn't know my mom's sick. That's right, red splashes. He ran out on me and the baby. And the military won't tell me where they sent him. No, I don't think it's fair that the army keeps a boy from talking to his father on his birthday, either. Drive safely, guys. Kitty: Of course we will. All right... We'll meet tomorrow at 1700 hours. We'll communicate with these satellite telephones here. Now, you take that one there. And if anything goes wrong, I will pull the plug, I promise. [Sighs] 1700 hours? 1700 hours, man. Ready? Yeah. Let's do it. Good luck. All right. [Car engine starts] Amanda: We'll be fine, bucky. You just take care of you. Come on, bucky. See ya. Be careful, Wheeler. Come on! Jesus, if the general could only see me now. Get going. [Telephone beeps] Chappy. Yeah, we're in. Good. Remember, no heroics. Right. Be careful. I gotta go. Chappy: Hold it! Roll your window down, soldier. General, yes, sir! What are you carrying? Uh, bathroom supplies, sir. Bathroom supplies, huh? Let me see your manifest. Yes, sir. Those are bathroom supplies... toilet paper... Chlorine bleach? Acidic-based toilet cleaner? Soldier, you know if you mix this together you get mustard gas? You trying to endanger this entire complex? No, sir. All right, be quiet. Yes, sir. You take this. I'm gonna keep my eye on you. You follow me. Yes, sir! Guard: What are you escorting today, general? Bathroom supplies. Toilet paper. It's a dirty job, but somebody's gotta do it. Sir. Screw you, Luther. All right, step back. Ooh! Ooh! Come on, I've been waiting for you! I don't exactly have a map to this place. Good day, colonel. It could take hours to break this system. Try... Operation dark star c-o-v-2-a- double 3-1-5-6. Operation dark star... classified, joint u.S./soviet assault force. Commanding officer... it's brigadier general Charles sinclair. One and the same. Now what? Now, we cross-reference our way into the heart of the system. [Beep] Ok, we can try c-o-v-e-a-4-5-e-double a. It's alternative scenarios. [Beep] Wait, wait, wait a minute. What's that soft combat? Soft combat... feasibility study by doctor Francis gully and major Neville birkett. Open it and see. Colonel birkett? Better take a look at this, sir. Colonel, this is being accessed from a terminal inside the building. Put a tracer on it now. Master control, put a trace on gc-4. Doug thought the letters started with t-x-c and ended with an "a." 7 and and "a." Come on. Wheeler, you little skid mark. The plan's coming together. Yeah. Just sit there and buckle up. Now? We're home free. I don't think so. You gotta be kidding. [Laughing] We're dead, duster, we're dead! Get us out of here, will you? Doug: I'm trying! Eat this. Stop going in circles! Do something! T-x-c-7-a-6-3. Oh, my God. [Telephone beeps] Hey, Doug, it's called operation pandora. Destabilization of hostile regimes through the use of eliminator diseases. That's really interesting, chappy, but I'm a little busy right now. You make your enemy too sick to fight, you can win the battle without firing a damn shot. My money! Good-bye, Luther! Whoo! [Alarm beeping] They're onto us. All right. Print it out. Let's get out of here. [Siren] Here's the printout. Go! They know about pandora, sir. Get them. Chappy, they sealed the door. Be quiet, listen to me. Listen to me. You look around carefully. Find something to get this door open. Shaw: A chain. Hurry, Peter. Anything. You'll find something. Hurry up, now come on! Lower it to me. Link that to the jeep. You get it? Back off, back off. Come on. Let's go. Go! [Gunshots] Good job, Doug. Arm yourself. Get back with the others. Doug: What about you? We're gonna make a little side trip, and we're gonna need some help on this one. Good luck. See you. Chappy, who's gonna believe us? I think I know someone. Come on. Let's go. Got it. Thanks. Kids, I just heard from smudgy Jeff in mills landing. He just spotted your convoy heading southeast on rural route 19. Let's go, Dana. Whoa. Hey! Shouldn't we wait for bucky and the general? You heard chappy. We're recon. You guys are nuts! They're gonna be radioing ahead. I know that. You show-off, you. Heh heh. What's goin' on?! Woman: Hold it! Brad, we need your help. Put those weapons down! Birkett's right behind us. Airmen... If colonel birkett or any of his men try to enter this building, I want you to shoot 'em. Whew. All right. Entertain me. We're gonna get rid of these paint bullets and load the planes with the real McCoy, ok? Cool. Dana and Rudy went after them. What? Dana and Rudy took a plane. Ok, guys. Change of plans. I want you to load up your planes, and we're gonna go now, ok? So hurry up. Let's go. I'm sorry, sir. I can't let you beyond this point. Do you know who I am? Yes, sir, and I'm sorry, I can't let you through. Get the hell out of my way. Now, that's an order. Love to see birkett's face. Where we going? Talk to the doctor who helped write the report on soft combat. Francis gully? Current posting is Craig air force base. Rudy: We're over rural route 19. There! It's over there! Hang on. Rudy: Watch this, Dana. We'll force 'em off the road just like Wheeler. Give me the gun. Sir. Dana: Rudy, they've got guns! We have to stop them! Take him out, major! Take him down! You take down that bird! We're hit. We're hit. I can't hold it! I can't hold it! Don't panic. Don't worry about it. Hold on. Hold on. All right, men. Let's move out. I want that plane. [Engine sputtering] Hold on. Hold on. We're gonna go down, ok? Did you guys catch that? Let's get down there. Roger. Rudy: Get out! Run! Rudy: Come on, Dana! Aah! Rudy! Rudy! [Sobbing] Are you ok? Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! They shot him! They shot him! I'm... I'm sorry. Ok, he's going into shock. Get him into my plane. No, no. No way. Just put him in mine. 'Cause you're gonna be busy. Go. Hey! Stop, or I'll shoot! You know, I was in the air force, flew jets. Then I got shot down and... ahem... spent some time in a, uh, Soviet prison... As their guest. Are you familiar with the term "psychological torture"? No? Bite me. Nice wasps. [Buzzing] Is this a working air base? It's running on a skeleton crew. You know, this was my first command. Now it's just another victim of federal cutbacks. I don't know how the bureaucrats expect us to defend them if they keep cutting us off at the knees. All right, Brad. Let's get out of here. Sorry, chappy. Brigadier general sinclair, may I present major peirce and captain mcquade. [Wasps buzzing] Let's see. You stand back. See... I don't have much time. See, now, the wasps, they're not like bees. They can sting maybe 4 or 5 times before they die. That much venom could... Burst a man's eyes, swell up his tongue so he chokes to death. Well, here goes nothin'. You haven't asked me anything! Ask me something! Come on, Doug. You know, man... Yeah, ease up, man. Come on, anything! Come on! Ask him where the convoy's going. Craig air force base! Who's in command? Major Miles peirce! Ok, men, let's get this job done. Let's move! Let's go then! Get those crates loaded into that bird! You handle those crates like they're your little baby girls! You understand me? Let's move, gentlemen! General kettle: All right, chappy. Let's go. You, too. Come on. Let's go. Chappy, this is Dr. Francis gully. Major, one of the canisters you brought in is faulty. You took a great risk... my orders were to deliver 6 canisters... why don't you and captain mcquade see to the last stage of preparation. What about the prisoners, sir? Airman fincher and I'll handle them. Chappy's not gonna try anything with these children around. I had to shoot one of these children, general. I wouldn't underestimate 'em. Chappy: Killing babies now, Brad? All right, let's go, chappy. We've talked about it. We're goin' after him. You guys don't seem to understand. This is not mock combat with paint guns and rules. These men will kill you. Don't you think we know that? Dana: We don't need your permission. You're just kids. We're gonna do it. I'm not lettin' you. Doug... What is with you? We are goin' after the guy who shot Rudy. You wanna be a hero? Trust me... It's not worth it. [Cell phone rings] Fincher: Hold it. Get your hands off! Stop it! It's just a phone call. General kettle: Easy, easy. Hold it. Hold it! Give me the phone. [Ring] [Ring] Chappy, it's Doug. Listen, Rudy's been shot. This is getting out of hand. It's time to pull the plug. I couldn't agree more, captain masters. Interfering will only get you killed. General kettle? Where's chappy? He and your friends are my guests, and my continued hospitality depends very much on you not doing anything rash, son. Of course, it's been a long time since you've done anything rash, hasn't it? Time in a Soviet prison can take the iron out of a man. We all know about the depression, the shaking. I survived. Cowards always do, Doug. Know why they survive? They survive because they run away from their dignity. You keep on running, son. You run. Trying anything else'll get you and your friends dead. Ok, load up. We're goin' after them. Yeah! Thanks. Colonel, a crop duster just brought a wounded boy into beckvay county hospital. She told the police he's been shot by a soldier. Get over there now. General kettle: Is that safe? Dr. gully: It is now. That idiot major of yours could have infected the whole southeast coast... banging it around on a truck. A truck is less conspicuous, that's all. Air force intelligence has been sniffing around since we diverted the f-16s. That's why birkett knew we were on that base. They were chasing after you. I presented a report to high command on the feasibility of soft combat. Birkett opposed every scenario. Where are they taking the canisters? Only one target makes sense from this area, and that would be... Cuba. Isn't that right, Brad? Exactly. No more communists, no more refugees fouling our beaches and contaminating our cities, and no more Castro to remind us of how emasculated our country has become. And once we've demonstrated the effectiveness of pandora, we can repeat the operation anywhere... South America, north Korea... anywhere we need to destabilize a regime. You forgot that Doug's gonna go to the authorities, you know, the government. The government will deny, deny, deny, deny, and secretly, men of real power will be pleased. This should all be familiar to you, chappy. It was your rescue of Doug masters' father that inspired me. Yes. What? You saw injustice, dreamed up a plan, and went ahead and did it... to forget the bureaucrats with their impotent backstabbing ways. Gosh, I... I admired that, chappy. I really did. You're gonna have to forgive me now, because I would hate to miss the end game. What happens to us? Dr. gully has always enjoyed bad health. Sorry, chappy. [Door hisses] Well... What's your little darling here gonna do to us? Pandora is an advanced smallpox derivative typified by fever and pustular eruptions. In the interest of mercy, it has been improved to the point where it can kill in hours, minutes if the dose is concentrated enough. How very compassionate of you. It spreads like wildfire, but it can be killed with any smallpox vaccine. That's the key to making it manageable. Ah. Well, that's the thing about wildfire. There's always somebody around to fight the spread. Isn't that right, Ms. Shaw? Kitty: Let's go! Dr. gully: No! Stop! Aah! No! Hurry. No! Aah! No! Get up! No! No! Stop! Help! [Screaming] Chappy. Not until these turn green. These are sensors. [Alarm buzzing] [Tone sounds] Let's go! Something's gone wrong. I want those birds in the air now. Let's go. All right, men, let's saddle up. Attention. This is an all-service emergency. There's a hostile aircraft originating from Craig air force base bound for Cuba. This is an all-service emergency. There's a hostile aircraft originating from Craig air force base... Mara, get this man to call for some backup right now. And tell them we want choppers. Where's the closest chopper base? You can't do this. The boy needs to stay in the hospital. Bring the boy. Officer, listen to me, this boy... get out of my way. I'm on an official government high security case. Hey! Hey! Come back here. Hey! Hey! Jeez, he's got my car. Chappy on radio: This is an all-service emergency. There's a hostile aircraft originating from Craig air force base... Did you guys catch that? They're gonna drop those canisters on Cuba. Let's continue on. I'm heading over to the base. I repeat, attention. This is an all-service... excuse me, sir. I'm afraid you'll have to stop now. I'm gonna have to kill you myself, chappy. Nothing can stop pandora now. Nice set of wheels. Minotaur, you got 2 bogies moving in from the west. That's confirmed. Minotaur leader to minotaur 2 and minotaur 3. I will escort cyclops to target. You take out the bogies. Roger, minotaur leader. [Police sirens] We got company. Oh, no. They're a couple Miles back. Coming around. Did you see those antiques? T-6 trainers. We're sitting ducks for the rockets. Follow my lead. Climb. I'm going to stall. I'm going to stall. Just a little longer. Missiles behind us. Pull out now. Dive! They maneuvered too sharply for our missiles. Time to get up close and personal. Here they come. Damn it, I overshot. They're so damn slow, you're past them before you can hit the trigger. Come in from above at an easy glide. You can pot them like Clay pigeons. I can't see them. I can't see them. Aah! Dana, I'm hit. Take over. Take over. Malcolm! Like shooting birds in a cage. [Beeping] Missile lock? Someone's got missile lock on me. These old planes don't have missiles. No, asshole, but I do. Holy God. Minotaur 2 and minotaur 3, take evasive action. I flew right into his guns. My systems are shot. I've gotta bring it down. Gotcha! Nice shooting, slick. Duster, glad you could make it. Look, I'll take the last jet. You guys go after the c-130. What about Malcolm? Let's go. I wouldn't miss this for the world. All right, let's do it. Good hunting, eagles. Time just caught up with you, masters. Major Pierce is gonna burn you all the way down to the ocean just the way it should have happened years ago. The tape, Doug. Listen to the tape. Chappy. Chappy on tape: Hey, Doug. Hope you're not too angry or too busy to listen now. If I had known you were alive nothing in the world could have stopped me from getting you out. All reports said you were dead. If I didn't look farther, it was because it hurt so much to look at all. You know, I remember when you first came to me with your hare-brained scheme to rescue your father. You were a boy with a boy's contempt for the impossible. But you believed. Before long, you got me to believe, too. Well, I still believe. I believe the Doug masters I knew then is alive and well. He just lost his contempt for the impossible. Nothing is impossible, Doug, if you believe in who you are. In who you've always been. Major Pierce... Identify yourself. Your jets are gone, major. I'm asking you to return to the U.S. mainland. And who the hell are you? I'm a crop duster. And I'm death. For a crop duster, you're a hell of a jet pilot, son. I'm used to killing pests. [Beeping] Eject, major, eject. Eject. Death, thou shalt die. They're all over us. Corporal Scott, would you be good enough to put out a welcome for these people, please? 60-caliber. What are they doing? They're setting up machine guns and they're gonna open up the back door. They can't. They're gonna de-pressurize the plane. We're gonna be sucked out. Not if they wait till the plane gets low enough first. Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second, I got an idea. Stay here. Hang on, ok? Hang on for your life. Who opened the door? We are not low enough. Corporal Scott, report. Aah! I think somebody goofed. Get back there. Check it out, now. Peter! Peter! Kitty, hang on! Don't let go! Peter! Kitty, it's ok, just hang on! Come on, come on. Get off me! Let me go! Aah! Whoever's flying that thing must have taken lessons from kitty. I heard that, Wheeler. Kitty? Kitty! You're ok? Guys, listen, I'm having enough problems flying this plane, ok? I dumped the canisters. They're at the bottom of the ocean. Where's the pilot? He stepped out. Sergeant osgood, it's time for a strategic withdrawal. Please, get me my helicopter. Chappy, you're infected. Infected with something more virulent than pandora. Disloyalty. And it's killing my country. Well, loyalty is earned, Brad. It's nurtured. It's not the anesthetic you people think it is. You know, I'm gonna miss our little competitions, chappy. Any words for posterity? I hope your aim is as bad as your judgment. Not at this range. Not much chance of that. Well, nothing's impossible. [Shots fired] Doug, what the hell are you doing? Something rash. Sergeant, give me the gun. Lift up. [Police sirens] Are you ok? Hey. Ha ha ha. Hey. You came back. Of course. And I know you would have done the same thing if you could. What's that sound? Kitty's gonna land the c-130. Uh-oh, we better get out of here. Rudy's right, you know. We do want you to stay. I got a hankering to see Mexico. You know, new start. Well, at least stay until we find a replacement. How long? I don't know. It'd be, uh, few days, a couple weeks, hmm? Mexico will still be there. Guess a new start is where you make it. Guess so. Come on. Ah, it's not so bad here. Not if chappy's here. Welcome, second freshman class of the iron eagle flight school. If you pay attention, this could be the first day for a pretty good life for you. I'm chappy sinclair. This is Doug masters. He's gonna be your primary flight instructor. You gonna teach us to do that? That depends. On what? On you.
