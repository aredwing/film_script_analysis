Want to make one? It's out of our budget. We need to sell, or rent for six months or more. This wall cuts circulation of. What? This wall. - Which wall? - This one. That, over there. Make some room. - Let's tear it all down and build a house with our own hands. - And if we go to my mom's at least until you fnish the bedrooms? - It's all broken, the ants made a giant house and this one sucks. - We'll fix the house, minus your room. - They aren't moving. They're all dead. - I catch them, they try to escape and I squash them with my nails. They'll have their revenge! You're making me dirty. - Nooo! - Are you crazy? - You're mean. - You threw some on my tongue! - What? - On my tongue! - And my bedroom? - It's the largest one. - This one? - Yep. I bent my foot. Have you got the deed? We're working on it. - I sent a draft. I would love for you to see it. Whenever you want. Do you have it here? - Yeah, it's unfinished. - The future kid bedroom... Is it a girl? Ay, no, I love it! - That's what the doctor said it seemed like. - It's great, a daughter. - Yeah, I wanted one. Anyway, until they see the penis they play it safe. Let's quiet down, Lauti knows nothing yet. You had a csection, didn't you? - Yeah. Five hours pushing and he wouldn't come down. My belly full of bruises... A mess. You were induced? With a drip? Yeah, that serum they put on you... The scandal she made with the epidural! Screaming like cray... - The anaestheticst tells me "You're gonna be paralithic" And he leaves me alone! - Alone. - What did you want me to do? Hit her? A person coming out of your belly, Another one receiving him or her... It's a lot. Well... Another wine? - Whiskey? - No, we should get back. Well, then stay for dinner! I'll make pizzas. Uh, they are fghting... - Let them. Let them resolve it amongst themselves! Hey, hey! What's that? Santi! Santi! Stop it, stop it. Don't hit me! Santi! Make some room. Make some room. I'm tired. What's wrong? - I want to sleep! - Can't I hug you? It stings. You didn't buy me the razor. You smell of alcohol. - You too. I like it when you're drunk. - Stop it. - Stop what? Stop it. I want to sleep, c'mon! Stop it! Why do you get mad? Don't get mad. Are you mad? Are you mad? Don't get mad. - Leave it to me. - I don't want to! I don't like it! I don't like it! - Don't move... - No! Santi! Santi, don't touch everhing, c'mon. The chocolate cereal is there. I'll reach them for you, wait. Take them. No, no, no, don't start, nooo! No one likes it. And do you hide to smoke, that's the case? - It's not nice to leave it with the wires out. - I'll take it. - Where will you hang it? - On top of the desk. I won't let you. - What are you doing, Santi? - It's hot. - Don't put that in there. - It's hot! Where's the screwdriver? Can't find it. Take it. Har's collection? Did you see the catalogue of profles? Har's collection? - I can't make it at five. Tell them to send another helper. - Didn't you talk to your dad, told him we moved today? Dad, the milk has weird things on it. Tell mom to help you. - It has things, mom. - It doesn't, eat it. It doesn't have anything. Take it, it's too full. Now you're stained. It's nothing. It's nothing! He's a boy! Go change yourself! Lucia! Lucia! What do you want? Come here... help me. Hold it. Who's going to pick him up from school? - I wanted to talk to Gaston's mom, see if she can. You have your t-shirt inside out. - Tell the moving guys to be careful with the towers, they come of. - Anyway, we'll put everthing inside a box. So it's all in the same place and we don't lose anything. And we don't lose any pieces. - No, we won't take it. We are ready. - Santi, listen to your mom. - No, we won't take it! We can't. - Listen to your mom, Santi. Santi, could you listen!? Fuck! - Are you stupid? - There, it's done, it's nothing! - Give it to me, you'll cut yourself. - Get away! Get away! What's wrong? What a spoonful, eh? - What a spoonful! It's over, nothing's wrong. Let's go to school. Don't take mine. Let me know the address where I have to pick him up. Let's go. Boys! This is loose! Dad. Yeah, the ambulance already arrived. He was conscious, he spoke to his wife. Everything's ok. With Sanchez, his friend. Insurance should cover it. Yes, the boys are waiting there. What time does the fight leave? Yes, he already left me the key. I finish here and I go to the clinic, relax. Have a nice trip. Have a nice trip. Bye, bye. My dad goes on a trip and a guy falls. - But he had insurance, right? - Yes. - Well, then, we tell them he had a harness on, that it broke... Take me away from here. Could you help me move this from here? Take care of your things so you can leave fast. - Who asked you for help? - Mom did. C'mon, help me. I can't, I'm busy. - If you touch my stuf I'll kick you out. - Ok, ok, I understand! What's going on? This brat... I'm tring to fx things and he doesn't help. There's no way. Fix what? - The damp stains. - Ok, easy. Don't get in the middle. Don't make the kid listen to this. Hi! Your shoes... Where were you that you are all muddy? - He was afraid to stay, left me at the gas station. - And your employee? Did you speak to his wife? Went to the clinic? My legs are still getting numb. Didn't you have them checked? It's nerves. Why didn't you have yourself checked? You didn't see a doctor? I had things to do. Okay. I'll clean these for you. They haven't even stopped chipping. Whenever it rains, they leave. It's all sticky. Where is the bag with the medicines? Don't know. Bathroom, I suppose. - You drink too little water. That's why you get cramps. He doesn't take care of himself. Can I have some water? Want to eat? Eat, love. C'mon, it's good. Monday, we travelled and eat rice. - It's quinoa, not rice. The cereal the indians ate to go to war. Do you want to be a strong warrior? I don't like wars, I won't be a warrior. It's really good, mom. - Tomorrow, what will you disguise yourself as? Do we have a pirate costume? - Pirate? - Pirate! - Yes. - I love pirates! You'll learn a lot of english. I love that school. - I don't like it. The english teacher always yells at me when I ask for my eraser. I have to explain it's mine and he says "In english, in english". - Eat, eat now. - I'm explaining to grandma. Grandma will lend us fabric to make an eye patch. And paint to make blood? Eh, that's loud! - You're gonna break the table. - It's blocked. It's done. - Thanks, but eat! - You have too little. That way we don't waste that, we can eat it other day. If you eat i'll buy you trading cards. - You're gonna buy him trading cards? He's misbehaving and you're gonna spol him? Hey! To bed. - No! - You don't want to eat? Go to bed! Stop it! - Lucia. - To bed. Stop it! Walk. Lucia! - All my classmates are awake. - I don't care. To bed. Stop it! - Grandma's food sucks!

It's not an important wall. - How do you know? You haven't seen the blueprints. We'll make a lintel, about that height... And see the laterals too. Can you picture it? Some comfortable couchs... to read whilst listening to music. A wall to wall librar. And Santi running around. No, no, no. Yeah? Hi, Otero. Wait a second. How are you? Yeah, I got caught up on things. I was thinking of going tomorrow. Noo, no! I won't stand you up. Ok. See you tomorrow.

What's that dog doing here? - Easy, easy... - Well, but... Leave him, leave him... Don't get close! - Stop! - Leave him, come here! Leave me alone! Easy, easy... What are you laughing at? Can't you see that if you were alone that dog could have rpped your arm of? - That beast can't be loose! - I'll talk to the neighbours, don't wor. The house was empty too long, he didn't recognize us. - Yeah, you'll talk, I won't take care of anything else. And if you want to open that up, we need bars and an alarm. I won't take care of anything else! What happened? - My sister kicked you out? - The air conditioner broke. - Looks like it's gonna hail. Take care if you go out. What are you looking for? A clean shirt. I'll stay at my parents house today. I have to finish Otero's work. Are they opening? I told you. I told you, but you don't listen to me. Bye. You abandon me.
