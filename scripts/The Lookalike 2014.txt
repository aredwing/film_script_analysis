I sure as hell didn't deserve a good hand, dealing drugs for my ex-basketball coach Bobby... Dumbing down the population one brain cell at a time... Though I had my reasons. For years, I was hung up on a blown-out knee that ended my basketball career. Then, along came Mila. Choosing my bar for her final night out... and everything changed. Not now. Sadie Ann Hill. - How do you spell "Ann"? - A, double N, no E. - Where were you born? - New York. Your parents were convinced that you'd be a boy. - They'd chosen a name. - Thomas. No, that's incorrect. My mom liked the name Thomas. My dad liked the name William. When you were 11, your parents took you to the palace of Versailles. Yeah? What did you wear that day? What did I wear? I don't know what the fuck I wore. You had a friend accompany you. What was her name? Georgia? Something happened to Georgia in Versailles. Didn't it, Sadie? The correct answer will ensure that your friends get what they need. Yeah, something happened to her. Okay. I look forward to seeing you, my dear. Well, you need a drink? Hey, hey, hey. - What happened? - The guy they want me to screw. - I know him. - What? Who is he? William Spinks. Oh! I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Oh, God, I'm sorry. Here. Do you like shoes? Okay, you like shoes. Here. You come in here, I will give you a free pair. Okay? I'm sorry. Drew, are you still there? You thinking of pulling out? No, I'm not thinking of pulling out. I just... - I just need to think about it, okay? - Okay, baby. Whatever you say. All right. Can I get a drink? Yeah, I'm not going to be able to make it to Vegas this weekend. I got too much to do here. All right? - He's filming it, isn't he? - Listen! And he's going to send a tape to my dad, isn't he? I could give two fucks. I just don't want it to go public. It's not going public. All right? He's got a reputation, too. Okay. But I want a half a mil. You agreed to 300,000. Yeah, that's before I knew who it was. You didn't tell me I'd be fucking my dad's business partner. - And my girlfriend thinks... - Hey, we said to tell no one! - Relax. She's not going to say anything. - Hey. She's the only one you told? Huh? Is she the only one you told? And what does your girlfriend think? She thinks that you need me more than I need you. - Don't fuck with us, Sadie. - Frank. Frank! Fuck it. Okay. All right. All right! Half a million. I swear to God, you tell another soul, you are fucking dead! Hi. Hi. Is Joe there? No, he's not, unfortunately. Are you... you here for the... I'm Holt. Hi. Lacey. Yeah, well, you can wait here? No. If he's not here, he's not here. I should probably go. Well, I'm sure he won't be long. All right, that's it. That's the last of it. Good girl. Your dad did like dogs. He just didn't know how to pick the fast ones. We done? - Say hi to your mom for me. - We're done. - You don't go near her again. - Mom's pride and joy. - College hero to drug zero. - Goodbye, Vincent. Yeah. Come on, girl. - It's good, right? - Not bad. Just the right amount of MSG. Hey, here comes Frank. What's he doing? Did you see who came in that? That ain't his car. She drives a gold Camry. Jules is going to take it to the garage, and then Lewis will drive your jag. Crack. Whether you're selling it, smoking it, no good... What? No good comes from fucking crack. I'm sorry little lady. This deal is not for us. What, William Spinks retiring and passing his Columbian connection not for us? Anyway. The boat already left. - What? - They couldn't wait any longer. You call Spinks right fuckin' now, and you tell him, she pulled out. You think he's gonna let us sell his coke if she's pulled out? Willy wanted a Booty call with Sadie hill, our connection. - No Booty? We're fucked. - Aw, fuck. We're fucked! Who is that? Drew. "How did it go? - You were supposed to check in." - That must be that girlfriend. Relax. Everything is fine. He's not picking up. Weird. He's usually on time, I mean we arranged to meet here. Yeah, no, I know. It's not like him, which is why I can only assume it's... something's wrong... and I try not to get into his business. For legal reasons, too, but from what I can kind of piece together, it's something to do with the... what was he saying the other day? The supply coming in from the midwest. Having a hard time getting here. Probably due to the fact that it's, you know, illegal. Who am I to judge? People can do whatever they want, and I don't have any issue with any drugs, that anybody wants to do, but, it's... the thing I think about, I think about where it comes from, you know? I go to the bottom rung, and I think about the people who are growing it, you know, these poor peasant farmers in Bogota. They're not bad people. They're good people, they're just trying to provide for their families, but it's very lucrative. And the government's banned all these coco plantations, so they come in, do these raids, and if the farmers don't have money to pay them off, they throw them in prison, and they burn all the crops, and it takes months to recultivate, and during that time, who's paying for it? The kids. The kids whose fathers are in prison, whose mothers now taken to drinking a moonshiney-type palm wine, so they're alcoholics, they're out of the picture, and these kids are starving. And it's a really vicious circle, and I have a hard time not thinking about it every time somebody comes to buy a gram, you know? They wanna get hopped up on a Friday night, and I hear... - I hear kids in Colombia crying, - I'm sorry for the Colombians, okay? Yeah. Whoa... Hey. You okay? And what are you calling this show of yours? - Joe's Grand Cooking Paradis. - No, no, no, we dropped the "grand". - Joe's Cooking Paradis. - Are we sure? It loses something. Your expectations, and what's with the paradis? Why can't you just say paradise? - People respect the French. - He's right. And where are you guys filming this Martha Stewart shit? - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Hey, how about a little more respect for our cooking show aspirations here, pal? - Thank you, brother. - Yeah. Welcome, chef. - Europe, by the way. - Expensive. Yeah, budget's sitting at about 200k. How are you gonna fund it? Oh, no, let me guess... "Proudly brought to you by Joe's Grand Cocaine paradis." We dropped the "grand." Alby's got a guy at the food network. He says he's interested. Look, the planet needs a "no vacancy" sign when it comes to celebrity chefs. I mean, we got them growing out of our asses... Sam, Sam, I'm trying to turn a new leaf here. Okay? If you can't stand the heat, don't enjoy the "all you can eat" perks of my... Kitchen. Here you go. Oh, look at you! It's so... It's so good to see you. I know. Are you sure? About this? I'm not going through with chemo again. And I'm not waiting for it to slowly claim me. I'm ready. You know what they say about nembutal. Once you try it, you never look back. Thank you, my beautiful friend. Yes. Now, go. Hurry up. Get in. Get in. Get in. Hey, that's Bobby's jag. Go with the Camry or Bobby. Let's go with Bobby. Hello? You okay in there? Hey, come on. Open up. - Help. - Help? I'm trying... Stop! What do you mean, a lookalike? Well, Willie got his validation, last time he saw Sadie, she was 11. So, all we have to do is find a lookalike, - give her a tutorial, and move ahead. - God dammit. - Well, when'd the coke arrive? - Thursday. I don't know, man. What if Spinks finds out? Well, I'd rather rot in a landfill, then in prison, so... Where the fuck are we gonna find a lookalike? Fuck. You got her? Hey, man, what if she's got birthmarks? What? What if she's got a mark on her back or her thigh, some shit that Spinks knows about that's gonna trip us up. I don't know, what if she's missing a fucking nipple? You want to count her nipples? Fuck me! Okay. Hey, cowboy, come on, help Frank out. So Joe's your brother? Half brother. Yeah, I live in Houston, so I don't get to see him very often. Holt's an unusual name. Holt? Yeah. Well, my mom, thinks I'm the son of former Australian prime minister Harold Holt, who, as far as I know, drowned in '67. I was born in '82. I should probably start by saying my mother is bananas. Well, sorry if that's above your head. Clinical term. I'm sorry, have you heard from Joe? No. Sorry, no. - Do you need your fix? - Wow. I'm sorry, I know, I can be really judgmental. I... I didn't mean that. It's not you, at all. I can remove a person from the lifestyle. My lifestyle? What about your brother's lifestyle? He's the one who's dealing. Yeah, well, he's got really good reason to do that. - Well, yeah, I'm sure he does. - No, he does. He's, he's... He's bailing out our dad big time. He needs to make a lot of money. - Hi, mojitos. I hope you like mojitos. - Are you shouting? I told you I can read lips. All right, of course, I'm sorry about that. - Cheers. - Cheers. I don't want to sound insensitive, but you don't sound deaf. Really? How should deaf people sound? - Well... - No, I'm kidding. - I was deafened three years ago. - I'm so sorry to hear that. Oh, rub it in, why don't you? My voice hasn't changed much, but over time you can forget how to pronounce things. What were you doing in the men's room? Someone bumped into me earlier. I went to adjust my little friend, here, and I didn't see the sign. Well, you might be missing a leg, deaf, and occasionally blind, but you certainly weren't shortchanged in the looks department. The looks department? - Yeah. - Really? - That's as good as you can do? - I'm sorry, what? What? - The looks... - I'm kidding. Deaf joke. - I heard you. I have perfect hearing. - Funny. Funny. You're funny. Ha-ha. You're so beautiful, oh, my God you're so beautiful, - what are you saying? - I'm not... You don't know what I'm saying! - I'm just say... I was singing... - I don't appreciate that! I was... Oh, my God, you're so hot. - A little tickle in my throat. - Oh. Smoky. Sometimes I just like to... - I'm gonna hit you with this. - No, no, please, stop. That's heavy. - I've heard it's... - I know! Thank you, Julio, thank you. Coming through. Hop you around. Sorry. Thank you. Hey, Dillon, grab us a cab. A little further. A bit of a downslope here. - Hey, sexy leg! - Whoo! Very funny. Pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow! Idiots. Just ignore them. Taxi! Here we go. All right. Almost there. - Whoa! - Oh. Okay. You okay? Thank you. Hey, hey! Wait up a sec! Hold up! Hey! Hey! You forgot your leg. Night cap? Yeah. Not just basketball. There's football and baseball. Every sport he touched. Ping-pong! Except golf. For some reason, I was always a good golfer. You lucked out. That's the sexiest sport there is. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's really sexy. Yeah, there's a lot of hip movement going on. You got some putting and some chipping, right? Yeah. Yeah. Look at you. - You don't need it. - Don't need what? You don't need the shit. I'm serious. You... you... You have so much going for you. You're gorgeous and you're funny and you love your job. - I do not love my job. - Well... I love this acting class I was taking five years ago. Yeah? What is that? Why would you not do that? You can be an actress. You're so beautiful. - Shut up. - You shut up. I'm serious. Quit all this shit. You can do whatever you wanna do. You're way too hot to be a junkie. You really are. You're right. I'm not doing it. Not me. I'm not doing it. - Are you serious? - Yeah. That's great. That's great! Go with this. What about the deal? - I'll flush it down the toilet. - I'll do it right now. - No, no, wait, wait. - What, what, what? Sorry, sorry, sorry. - I just need one second. - Are you sure? - I'll be right back, okay? - Do you want me to wait here? No, I just need one second. It's not happening tonight. - You all right? - Yeah. I'll be right out. Okay. Okay. Hey, Lacey? I don't think Joe's gonna give you your money back. - I really don't care. - Okay. Hey, princess. I don't think so. - I don't know about this. - We'll find a girl tonight. Too tall. - How about you, sugar tits? - 5'7" and a half. Hey, this is the last one, all right? What about her? Good face, good match. Yeah, if we had time for a goddamned breast reduction. We need a hooker. That's it. Way too dumb. - No, that's a stereotype. - Fuck, too! All my years of dealing with hookers, did you ever meet one like Julia Roberts? Huh? I got an idea. We've got Jade, Dakota, Madison, Cindy and Dakota. Yeah, we don't work the same nights. Yeah, bitch gets Fridays 'cause she blew Michael. - Fuck you with your stinky pussy. - Oh, my God. You have to cut that shit out 'cause you got a motherfucking mouth like... - Girls! - Shut up! Dakota number two's great. - I'm Dakota one. - This is bullshit. All right. Thank you, ladies. The rest of you can split. Fuck this. - How tall are you? - Oh, I'm 5'2" and a half. Good, good. So there was a girl who had the gig, and she can't do it. So you got the job. It's a lot of dough. And, so you know, it's... They're gonna need you to... They're gonna need you to... Need me to what? We need you to fuck him. Asshole! Hey. Hey, it's not the kind of request you can prep, okay? - Jesus. - What's wrong with you? Oh, my God. Hey, Holt! Hey! Heading out. Sorry I have to leave so soon. I get it. It sucks, but I get it. I mean, it would've been pretty weird if Joe came home and... Yeah, yeah, I didn't even think of that. You left your purse in there. Shit. - I don't want to go. - I don't want you to go. - I'm gonna call you. - Okay. Okay. Hi. Coffee? Tylenol. You know what? I don't think I have any Tylenol. Coffee. - Hey. - Hey. We're a man down. You wanna play today? No, I'm gonna head home. I thought you were in Vegas. Nah, I changed my mind. Well, where are you? Hello? Oh, shit. I'm gonna pay you, brother. I am. Brother? Yeah! I know your brother. He paid. You and your father... You're both lame! - Look, this is your last chance, you dig? - I dig, yeah. - A hundred grand, Sunday. - A hundred grand? - What are you talking about? - Twenty on the dogs, fifteen on the ponies, eight up your nose, the vig, and you haven't paid in two months! - That doesn't make a hundred. - Cut the shit. I see you at the track, it's over for you. - You got that? - I got it. I have to go, but... do you wanna do something tonight? And, also, I would like to do something tomorrow night. And the night after that and... I wanna make sure I can book you the night after that, as well. - Get it in the books. - I'm sorry. I should've told you, but I'm going away. For how long? One more, and I'm done. Yeah, I know, I know. I actually have the money. Come on. The money is... Sixth race, barracuda bay. I-I-I'll pay you when I see you. Fuck! How am I gonna pay you until I see you? No, seriously, I'll take barracuda bay. Rich? Rick? Rich? Fuck! Fuck! There's mold all over the house. You can't even breathe in there. I really need to get... No, no, I-I understand that. I-I can't afford to pay that whole thing right up front. I-I just... right. Okay, listen. I'll have somebody over here to get in touch with you, all right? Where the hell were you last night? We had a surveillance team camped out all night waiting for your ass. I told them I was cool. You told them you were cool? I told you to get in and get out. I-I don't know. I don't know about all of this. You don't... what... Sweetheart, you were caught with a significant amount of blow. If you do not comply, then these charges... But I gave you all of that information about that pill press. And it was appreciated, but it's still not gonna exonerate you - from a potential two-year sentence. - Surely it's enough to do more for me... Oh, my God. I put my ass on the line for you. You know, everyone at the station, they think I'm an idiot. They think you're gonna screw this whole thing up. They'll be happy if a pretty young thing like you gets thrown in jail. Do you want that? This is a no-brainer for you. You know, Joe's not really that bad of a guy. He only got into this because his dad's in a lot of debt. Listen, Lacey, you're a very sweet girl. You're very fucking naive, though. We all have our problems. We don't have to become drug dealers in order to manage them. Surely there's... something else... that I could... Are you trying to bribe me? Come on. I've seen your... your finances. You're almost as broke as I am. I mean, you couldn't come up with a hundred bucks, let alone a hundred thousand dollars. It's really better that you just stick to the plan. Hey! Joey Mulligan! What's up? - I thought you were headed home. - No, no. I gotta talk to you about something. - You in trouble? - No. - Fuck, no. - Good, 'cause I'm done. - Yeah? With what? - With the shit. Debt's clear. - Are you serious? - Yep. Holy shit. That's great. That's great. Who's gonna take over? - I'll talk to you after the game. - Well, wait. Really quick. I'll talk to you after the game. - What's up? - Joey! Joey! What up? - Ready to do this? - Hey. - Hey. Hey, Joe. - What are we doing? - Joe, two seconds. - Really quick. - After the game. - All right. Hey, Holt! What are you doing here? It was Joe's game. I thought you might be here. - Right. Right. - Something wrong? No. Why? I'm just... - No. I got a lot of shit to do. - Right. I... I'll call you. Okay. Okay. That's what I need. Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe. What's up? Hey, Joe. How's it going? No, asshole. I don't want a midget hooker. I don't want a bitch that can fire ping-pong balls outta her bush. All right? I want her to look exactly like the picture. Exactly like the picture! What's up? Hey. Can we talk? Yeah, yeah, let's talk about how to play basketball, 'cause your legend's shrinking, Joey. - Come on. Hurry up. I got shit to do. - I need a loan. A loan? You're outta work six hours, you're outta cash? - It's for my cooking show. - What cooking show? - The food network wants it, but I... - No shit? Okay, one condition... I'm the host. No, I'm... I'm the host. Oh, you're the host, I'm the host, Mike here wants to be a host. Anybody can boil an egg wants to be a fucking cooking show host. I'm just breaking your balls, kid. Everybody's got a dream? Hey, come here. - Don't lose count. - Yes, sir. 'Cause I'm watching you. What? See this girl? She was... She is an old family friend. You okay? Yeah. She was gonna help me do something. Now she won't do this thing, so I gotta find another girl... A lookalike... to help me do the thing. - What's the thing? - Nothing. She gotta fuck someone. - Who? - That don't matter, 'cause this man... He hasn't seen her for a very long time. This can work. Can you help me? - What does the girl get? - She gets a lot of money. - How much? - 300k. - Why so much? - To do a good job, keep quiet. - So you don't want a screamer? - I don't want a hooker. I want a girl. Normal girl. You help me find a suitable girl, I'm gonna fund that cooking show, okay? Now, look, you got till tomorrow, no longer. Nobody else is to see that picture. Got it? - Okay. - Okay. My man. Go. Move your ass! Yo! Hey, who's that... That tall guy that kept elbowing you? La'Shawn or Da'Shawn, Ti'Shawn. - Something apostrophe Shawn. - In a better mood now, are we? What do you mean? Yeah. I'm all right. - Where'd you get it? - You think I'm using? Are you nuts? I'm... no. Relax. Lacey come by last night? - Good. - Yeah. So she picked up the deal? I wanna talk to you... Who are you calling? Who's that? Who is that? - Lacey. - Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay. - She didn't want it. - Oh. Okay, so the drugs are in the tin, then? Not... no, not exactly. - The drugs are up your fucking nose? - Joe, she didn't want her money back. - Do I seem concerned about the money? - Well, then you... You shouldn't deal from the apartment, okay? - What do you expect me to do? - You swore to me you'd quit. I'm fine. Joe, look at me. I am fine. I'm trying to tell you something. I'm not the one you need to worry about. What? This is no joke. Give me all the money right now! - Go, go, go, go, go! - Okay, please. It's a real gun. Give me all the money now. - Okay, I'm... - Go! Don't talk, go! Okay. Okay. I'm so sorry. I'm not gonna hurt you if you put the money in the bag. - Go, go, go. - Here's the money. Take the money. - Put it in a bag! - Okay, okay, okay, okay! - Go! - Okay. I'll fucking kill you! I see more. - I see there's more! Don't fuck with me! - Okay! All of it, all of it. - Oh, fuck! - You better run. Please, please, just give me something. - Get the fuck out! - Please! Fuck! Fuck! All right. Well, how about her friend, Emily? No, no, no, the other blonde. The one with the... Hey, John, let me call you back. I'm in a lot of trouble, Joe. How much? A hundred thousand. To who? You don't wanna know. Cute. These girls are all local? Make a bunch of movies here now. Some big tax break or some shit. Oh. We gotta lose this Drew. I'm telling ya. Oh, fuck. Hey, Holt? - Hold on. - He showed me this photo of a girl. Yeah, hold on. What? This is crazy. Bobby needs a lookalike for some sex deal. - Yeah? - If I find someone, he'll give me 200k for my show. - What? - Yeah. But the girl, she gets... she gets 300. $300,000? For what? - For fucking somebody? - Yeah, so, you know, I... I was thinking if we could swing it, you know, 200 for the lookalike, 100 for you. - Let me see. - Yeah, but we only have 24 hours. Holy shit. Hi, J.C. Yeah, yeah. I-I... I was just wondering, has Sadie been in there today? No, no, no. Everything's fine. I-I... yeah... Listen, I'm gonna have to call you back. Hello. How are you today? I said, how are you? Hello. How are you? I-I'm fine. What can I help you with? I'm looking for Sadie. What's it concerning? She said she would hook me up with a free pair of shoes. So... - So she offered to give you free shoes? - I'm sorry. Did you say something? I'm... I'm deaf. So I didn't catch what you said. But I-I can read lips. I-I was just... She's always giving away free shoes. Well, she bumped into me at a bar the other night... - Wait. When? Was it on Friday? - Yes. What bar? You look amazing. You really do. Glad you came. Sorry that I'm late. I was with some friends - debating whether or not I should come. - Right. I get it. I-I-I'm just gonna say it. I-I was an asshole to you the other day. It's a long story, but it wasn't anything to do with you. I was dealing with some weird shit from Joe, and, I just had... I-I brought this energy to you, and I'm sorry. 'Cause the truth is, I can't stop thinking about the other night. - I-I'll do whatever... - Just shut up. I forgive you. - I forgive you, too. - You did get me off cocaine. Hey. Come on in. I thought you were going away. It didn't work out. I have to talk to you about something. Saturday night, after you left, Joe and the club owners came over, and they were saying all this shit about you. And I got so mad, that's actually... - That's how this happened. - What? Yeah. They were saying that they had an inside man at the N.O.P.D., and they were adamant that you were somehow involved and were gonna turn in Joe... - Why? Why do they think that? - I don't know. They're crazy, and I tried to tell them that, I swear to God. Obviously they didn't listen. But, Lacey, they want your head. These guys don't fuck around. - Wait. I have to have sex with him? - This is insane. What's insane is that she almost turned me into the cops. - I told you I was sorry. - She said she was sorry. I can't believe we're talking about this. Joe, I don't care what these guys are threatening. She's not doing it. I can't believe we're even talking about this. What are we talking about? If I do this, does that mean that I'm off the hook? No one is coming after me? Only if you get your detective friend off my ass. Well, I... I think that I can. I just need an advance. Okay. No. Hold on. Listen, you don't have to do this. - There's got to be another way. - Maybe it's not so bad. I get $200,000, no one's gonna kill me. I'll quit my job, finish my acting course. We could go on a beach vacation somewhere. I could start over. Okay. All right. I can do this. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Tell me about her. Who? My character. This was the best jambalaya, other than my own, you will ever taste. Yeah, when am I going to try this legendary cooking of yours? Joe Mulligan in the flesh. Got me a birthday tomorrow. - Could use some reinforcements. - No, man. Now's not the time for this. Seriously. - Not right now. Seriously. - Sign your life away. - Oh. - Please. Autograph. Sure. What's your name? Sorry. Oh, it's for my wife, Julie. Yeah, personally, I thought you were overrated. I kind of forgot her big day last year, so, you know, trying to make it up. There you go. "Julie, your husband is an ass. Leave him. Joe." She's gonna love it. - Thanks, bro. - Yeah, okay. - There you go. Your... your pen. - I'd like that back, yeah. Listen, I've done some things that I'm not very proud of in my life, but... Since I've met you, I-I... I never wanna let you go. I'm sorry. Was that too intense? No, you're wonderful, and... I just can't stop thinking about how much of a jerk that guy was. Yeah, well, welcome to my life. I have to take this. I'm so sorry. I got the check. I will be... right back. Sorry. All right, gentlemen. Remember, Lacey... She's only doing this because she thinks you want her head. - I do want her head. - You want her vagina. Bobby, there are a lot of vaginas on my to-do list, but hers ain't one of them. Well, Frank, without her head, she's useless to old Willie Spinks. So don't lose yours. - After we have her vagina... - Then I'll have her head. No, no, no. No, no. No one's having anyone's head, okay? She's gonna loan us her vagina. She gets to keep her head. - Can we please stop saying "vagina"? - Bitch was gonna turn you in. Bitch had no choice, and now she's offering us a bone. Vagina. - Do we agree? - Yeah. Let's brief her. Can you pull your hair back a little? Fuck me, man. Wow. Wow. All right. It's gonna take place this Thursday, okay? At a hotel in the French quarter. We're not gonna tell you which, 'cause the less you know, the better. - What's the call time? - The what? - What time am I expected? - You'll be picked up 6:00 P.M., sharp. For hair and makeup? Someone's gonna do my hair and makeup, right? - You can't do it? - She'll definitely need a hairdo. Yeah, but we should, you know... We should fucking... We should do it. You think you can make my hair look like this? I'll need a spray. I think I should consult with... Hey. All right. You're not gonna consult with anybody about anything, okay? - I can't get a spray? - What's a spray? To bronze the skin. Take a spray. But don't tell the person spraying you why you're taking the spray. Yeah. And don't come out looking like an oompa loompa, all orange and shit. Don't see your usual hairdresser. You know, you fucking... Got it. You know, across town. Sweetheart, you're perfect. You got the look. - But you unsettle me. - Bobby, you can trust her, I swear. Reassure him, Lacey. Reassure him. - You have a floater. - I got a what? It's a little black speck in your eye. It's worse in the sunlight. Yeah, in the glare, it... The thing, yeah. I get 'em, too, mostly when I'm stressed. There's nothing to worry about. Your vision will get used to it eventually. Come on. Pick up, pick up. - Hello? - Hey, Holt, how's it going? This is Sadie. - Why do you sound like that? - Sadie's from New York. I was trying to get in character. - Shouldn't you be at work? - I called in sick. I gotta do something to take my mind off of the big day. You got any suggestions? Just transfer it. Transfer it. You're not... not like... You're not dancing. It's just right to lef... - Just transfer the weight, just like this. - That's what I'm doing. Yeah, but you're doing it like you're at a club. - Get outta my way. - All right, all right. Nice! Okay. Thank God. You're really terrible. You're really bad. - You hit it. - I did. It was really ugly, but you were real purty doing it. Holt mulligan, hitting balls into the Mississippi? Right. What's up, Vincent? Yeah. I bet you wish in life you could take a mulligan sometimes. Whoa! He's good. So how do you know each other? - Through his brother. - Right. - A client of Joe? - Friends. Just a friend. Don't sweat it, honey. I won't tell nobody. Hey, you coming over to my birthday party on Saturday, right? Yes, of course. Okay. You bringing the cake? Yeah, yeah. Joe's gonna whip something up. Yeah, 'cause, you know, at my age, I get all hung up about the frosting, right? - Right. - Right? Yeah. Okay, here we go. This one's for you. Whoa! That's a really nice shot. Well, I'll tell Joe you said hi. Great. Thanks. Nice meeting you. - Good... - Who the fuck is that? - Come on, Norma. - He's, just, you know, one of Joe's pals. - Okay. All right. - I don't feel like it. Really? Oh, you were so... You had such a promising start. Okay, so, this is kind of weird. I-I was, I've been seeing this guy, Joe mulligan? Okay. And I found this photo in his wallet the other night. I don't understand. Sadie never mentioned a Joe. She's still not picking up. And I know the texts aren't from her. Have you thought about calling the cops? Yeah, but I can't. Look, there's a deal going down with the guys who own the bar. They're paying her 300k to screw some guy. I didn't catch that last part. 300,000 to fuck a guy. I'll be home soon, all right? - What's up? - I wanted to give you this. I left the battery thing at home but I'll give it to you and I'll have the rest for you by the end of the week. Where'd you get this? Do you want it? All right, then. No. No, no, no, no, no. This is not what we agreed on, okay? Yeah, well, I'm not happy about this either. Do I sound happy about this? All right, listen. Okay, listen. Listen. Just reimburse me for the French bread pan, okay? I will keep the cassoulet ramekin. Right, okay. You know what, I actually I want the skillet with the copper base, gotta have the copper base. All right, Janet? Can I call you back? Thanks. - What? What is it? What's wrong? - I'll tell you what's wrong. Your little buddy Vincent, and his fucking dog have been following us around all day. - That's what's wrong. - Us? Who's us? Lacey. Me and Lacey. - What? - Why are you hanging out with Lacey? I'm not hanging out with her. We just went to hit some balls. You realize if I was here Saturday night when she came over, I'd be in jail right now. - You understand that? Right? - Yeah. I know, Joe. Come on, man. She was fucking scared. She had cops half way up her ass. And there's, there's a reason, by the way, that... Oh, so you like her now? You have a little crush on her? Oh, shut up. You always do that. No, I don't have a crush on her, I just... Let me ask you, though. This guy that she's got to... - Fuck. - Well, what do we know about him? We know what we need to know, which is nothing. Right. But.. Okay, but is, is she gonna be safe? I mean, can we ask him to wear a condom at least? Or two? Come on, come on, come on. Yo, lady bug. Hey, we got cheap shoes, cheap handbags, what you need? - Thank you, but I'm kind of busy. - Oh, it's for your store. Designer. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Look, look, look. We got cheap shoes, we got Gucci, Fendi, Prada. - His price is cheap, I'm telling you. - Oh, they're cheap, all right. Did either of you two slave away at fashion school while surviving on two-minute noodles and tap water? Actually, we love two-minute noodles. Look, baby, ain't no trouble here, come on. Come on. - Get your hands, let me go... - Come on, hurry. Come on, Jules. Come on. - Come on, man, hurry up. - Get off me. Get her leg, man. Come on. Oh, nice. Bitch, stop moving. Come on, control her. Put her in here. Wait, wait, wait, we ain't doing no killing, man. Hey, you want to take over for Joe, you got to step up your game. - Joey never killed nobody, though, Frank. - She's seen your faces. Get her in there. Fuck! Now she was going to compromise our deal. So harden the fuck up. - What did she do, Frank? - She asked too many questions. - Sorry, boss. - Nah, it's all right. She's just looking for her girlfriend, who she's never going to see again. That's right, honey. That's right. He was always going to fuck her, and then kill her. I just left that out of the job description. Sorry. Push it in. But you don't tell Bobby I said that. In. Get up some speed. Come on. There you go. Great. Great. - Come on, push it in, man. - Shit. Useless. You're useless. - Frank, it ain't working. - All right, all right. Any of you idiots have a gas can? Have to do everything myself. All right. We got a gas can. All right, let's go to work. Come on. Come on. Hey, Bernard. Thanks. I'll clean up before I get outta here. Okay. Contrary to popular opinion, the key is to keep flipping the burger so that you get a nice delicate crust on the outside but it stays rare on the inside. Now, we've got homemade thousand island, all right? Which is going to consist of, olive oil, lemon juice, worcestershire. We got some paprika. You don't seem impressed. How do you know Sadie Hill? I know about the deal. With Holt and Lacey. Who are you? - I found a photo in your wallet. - You went through my wallet? What's happened to Sadie? Look, she's... She's not playing ball with this deal. That's all. Her girlfriend Drew said she was all about it, that she had a meeting the night I met you and Drew hasn't seen her since. Really? Are you a drug dealer? Call Mila. Face time. And that's the only reason, the only reason, I got into it in the first place. Now I have this one crazy deal. I get to do my show, and I leave all this crap behind. Haven't you ever just wanted to hit a race? To start over? You okay? Yeah. Your, your phone. I have to take this. Lacey, what the fuck you doing? - What do you think? - I look ridiculous. Why so blonde? It's for a role. Some hotel in the quarter. But less you know, the better. Yeah. I got it. But, Bobby, I'm curious, what's the deal with this Sadie? I mean, what does she think about all this? She's on vacation. All expenses paid. Okay. Well, then, that's cool. - Is that all? - Yeah. - Good. - I'll be in the kitchen. You hungry? Nope. Hey, Joe? You did good with Lacey. Thank you. Where is Sadie? I want to see Sadie. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - I want to see Sadie. - Put that fucking thing down. - You stay back. Where is my girl? She's fine. If you don't bring Sadie to me right now, then I'm calling the cops. Why the fuck would we hurt Sadie? We need Sadie. Oh, yeah. You need her. Right about... Fuck. Frank! What's wrong with you? Motherfucker. Holt! - Hey, hey. Get up. Get up. - The fuck? - Deal's off. - What? Call Lacey. The deal is off. Why? Oh, you're nervous? Yeah? You know if I don't get Vincent that cash on Sunday, I'm going to get shat out by a crocodile on Tuesday, so, I get it. We have to find another way to get the money. I knew you'd do this. There's no other way. Joe, we talked about this. Come on, come on. Look, you think I really want her to do this? I like this girl. I don't want her to go fuck... - Two girls are dead. - I know, I know. But this is different. She's going to get in and out. It's going to be fine. I've taken precautions, believe me. Oh, yeah? What precautions have you taken? Okay. Mace. Hey. I went and asked about Sadie. It was an accident. She's dead. Sorry. That's why they needed the lookalike. - I should call Drew. - No. You can't. - D-day. - Yeah. Whatever happens tonight, I just want you to know, I understand. Yeah? Frank. I'm here. I hope she's not far. The product will be delivered as soon as I'm satisfied. Yeah. Put the money in the room? Yeah, they're right above me. I can hear every sound. - Lucky you. Keep me posted. - Oh, yeah. You know what's the one thing a girl finds more disconcerting than having to sleep with a total stranger for money? Having a guy watch her while she does her makeup. Sorry. I hear ya. Okay. Let me get you another drink. New York. You Lacey? Holt! Holt. - Holt? - Joe, this is Lacey. What's wrong? You should be at the hotel. This woman, she came in here. And she was dressed like Sadie. She had her hair cut. - What? - And she, she drugged us and she bound us on the bed, and she stole my phone, and, I don't know, she took the outfit. I don't know what she's doing. Was that, I mean was that, was that Sadie? I mean, who else could have known about this? No one. Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Sadie. You've grown up. Do you recognize me? You were very young. Can I get something for you? Lobster. You can go now. Thank you. Yeah, hi, I'm looking for a Lacey Fitzgerald. I believe she has a room there. - Let me check, ma'am. - Thank you. I'm sorry, we have no guests under that name. All right, thank you. Mila! Mila. Mila! Mila. What the hell are we going to do? I'm going to fuck this guy, get the cash, and save my ass. Yes, hello? Hi, I'd like a lobster please. And another bottle of champagne. That's right. Thank you. - What the fuck. How long's it been? - Louis took her in at nine o'clock. - Not too bronzed? - I haven't seen her. So he does the deed, he leaves, briefcase stays in her room. Why does the briefcase stay in the room? She takes it when she's done. Of course. Hey Frank, is there something going on I don't know about? Will you relax? I got this. No. Come on, come on, come on. Well, Sadie, I guess this is all a little strange, isn't it? Or is it Baps? Didn't your dad used to call you that? Sorry, I'm... nervous. Well, when I press record, I want you to act... like you love me. Okay? Hello? That doesn't matter. Just send up whatever you have. I'm sorry. - Talk to me. - I've got Bobby. You sure? - No, we got everything. Big deal went down. - I'm on my way. All right. I'll meet you at the station. Hey, hey, what are you doing here? - Is she up there? - Dude, this dude is sick, man. Fuck 'em and snuff 'em. We got to get up there. - The room's guarded, bro. Guns. - Fuck. - She ordered room service. Lobster. - Come on. Frederick. Good job, bitches. Yeah, it's the shit. Come on. Let's go. Let's get out of here, motherfucker. - Hey. - Joe Mulligan. - Yeah, man. How are you? - I'm excellent. Wow, all this going up to William Spinks? Room eight? We're really not supposed to say. You know what, I'm a close friend of his. Do you mind if I take it up? Flush it! Flush it. Flush this shit right now. Advancing through parking structure. Freeze. Put your hands on your head. Put your hands on your head. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday, dear Al. Happy Birthday, Al. I bet you never expected to see this when you turned your computer on today. Like when I came home six months ago and saw my little girl... My Georgia... Lying face down on the bed, having put a pistol to her temple. She was in and out of institutions her whole life. Her whole life. And I never knew why. Until... That suicide note explained everything. About all the things that went on in Versailles. Between an 11 year old and a 40 year old man. I couldn't save Georgia then. And... and you... You can't save Sadie now. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Can I help you? Yeah, I have champagne and lobster for Mr. Spinks. You're going to have to wait here. No, no, no, no, no. Joe. Joe, we gotta go, Joe. - Come on, Joe. - Get out of here. To the naval yard. Pier three. Pier fucking three, Paul. Five minutes. Go. Murphy. I got a man down. We're on the east side of the factory, the principal's headed north toward the river. I'm on foot. Hey. - The fuck are you doing? - Your dirty work. - Give it to me. - Fuck you. Hey. - Joey? What are you doing here? - Did you know she was going to die? - What do you care? - Did you know? Collateral damage. Bitch put the heat on us... Wrong bitch. Get out of here. Get back in the car. Go! Stop. Police. Bobby Zan. I got you, I will blow your fucking head clear off, I swear to Christ. That's right. Nice and easy. Put your weapon down. Put your weapon down, hands up. It's over, man. - Okay. - That's right. Nice and easy. Hands up. - To your ground, now! - All right. Joe, lovely Joe, who came into my world at just the right and wrong time. But that's not how I want you to remember us, as too brief or too late. I didn't lose my hearing or my leg in an accident. I battled cancer since I was eighteen. It was back and I was done. When I found out about the plan, I knew I could help. Because opportunities, moments, people, they come into our lives and shape things in the most unexpected, positive ways. Ways that shouldn't be measured with regret. Who's your friend? Oh, that's Joe's brother. Holt Mulligan? You know him? Seriously? Lacey, you realize he's a cokehead, right? Hey Holt, come here. You know what? You're a real asshole. - Remember that. - I know. So take this opportunity, Joe, and make the most of a new life, the life I know you want. And Joe? Don't forget me. Okay? And do take the time to make your own sauce. I know it's gonna sound a little fattening, but I like to use butter, cream, provolone, and romano. You know, good food really is like music. The beautiful notes take you back to that quality company, or that special occasion. Okay...
