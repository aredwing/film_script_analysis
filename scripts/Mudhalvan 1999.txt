Aren't you interested to fall in love? I don't want to love. I don't want to lose. Hey, get lost man. Good bye man. Okay. Hello Father! Pugal! Come inside. Father, what's special for today? This is the one. What is this father? You've made me a Politician. Just for fun I sketched you as a C.M. What? Why suddenly? Regarding your marriage - I've shown your horoscope to the Astrologer. He was surprised. Your horoscope depicts very good fortune. Horoscopes like this will be seen once in years. Earlier Statesmen Rajaji had a horoscope like this. Hey! You are going to become a big Politician. Father, If I get the Executive Producer Post in B.B. C or C.N.N., Or If I get a Gold Medal in Olympics I would feel more happy. Politics... Father, it's like a drainage. Come fast, come fast - It's running, running. Where? What happened? Look, look Titles are going on. Our son's title is going to come. Look, look, make a call to the bride's house. Rascals! These people won't hold the titles even for a minute. Fools, it has gone. You started shouting after seeing your Son's title! I got frightened.

Whatever your age may be, You will always be a child for us. See the girl's photo. Look at this, She looks like Pepsi Uma, - Yes. Look at that, doesn't she look like Renuka? I had shown your photo to them. They said, You look like a Superman. The T. V has become your obsession. Do you like the girl? She is nice, but something is missing in her. What's missing? Mother when you see a girl, she should create ripples in the heart. If you look at a heroine will she create ripples? Hey! You are watching the T. V too much. The T. V devil won't leave you - Keep quiet. Don't trouble us in between like a joker - Show your face. Tell me, how should your girl look like? I'll search. Her hair should be like Clouds. Eyes should be like that of a fish. Nose should be like a Parrot's beak. Lips should be like a rosy fruit. Neck should be like the Conch. Legs should be like a Plantain stem. She should have a poetic appearance like this. Look, does she look like her? Don't ask your father to search for bride. He will choose someone like her only. He has drawn a picture of a she devil. At the time of marriage, you also looked like this Really? How did you look? He looked like his cartoon. Your are a lucky fellow. Greetings! Viewers. Tamil Nadu's C.

You are getting in at the signal. Get down. Do you have sense? Why didn't you stop at the bus stop? I will stop or I'll not stop. Is it your father's bus? Hey! Get down. Our exam starts at 9 A.M. If we miss this bus, we'll not be able to write the exam. That's why, we rushed into the bus. You didn't stop, & you're talking like a fool. Now, are you going to get down or not? - No. Hey! Get down, get down. - No, I'll not. Driver attacked our man, catch him. Stop the bus, stop the bus. Students attacked me. Stop the bus, stop the bus. They are hitting me, hitting me. They attacked bus driver. Bus will not move, get down. Stop, What's the problem? Who is the bus driver. Start the bus. Because of you, there is a traffic jam. Do you know who I am? - Driver. I am ruling party's driver. - May be. Go & bring the camera. - Okay. I'll start the bus only when you arrest these students. Hey, keep quiet. This driver only attacked our student. We'll move only when he seeks our pardon. First park your bus on that side. At peak hour you're parking the bus in the middle of the road. Let the traffic be cleared then we'll argue... First you remove the bus. - The bus will not move. Hello control room. Near Teynampet signal a bus has stopped. There, whether the students have hit the driver, or the driver has hit the students, it's a big question. Traffic jam for 1 mile. Just because of that bus. Inform the Commissioner to come to the spot immediately. We'll find a solution. Hey, driver is going that side. Leader, Greetings. While he was on duty, Driver Murugesan's head is bleeding because students had attacked him. You phone & inform all employees of City Transport immediately. Stop all the buses in and around Tamil Nadu. Excuse me, is the auto free? Yes. Keep it on your head, it will come, go man. This is a too much. - Buddy, this is too much. Hey, come. Excuse me, Will this bus go to the temple? - You Swine. Get in, it'll also go to heaven. - Okay. Great! There is a traffic jam bus will not move. All are in tension you are reading newspaper. Cruel people! Why are you creating problems? My daughter is 32 yrs. Old & her marriage has been fixed only now. The bride & the auspicious thread is here. And groom's people will be waiting for us. The auspicious time is going to pass away. In such a situation, you're stopping the buses. Who will be responsible if my daughter's life gets ruined. Hey, get lost. - Cruel people. Sir, I've got the last chance for an interview. If I don't get the job I'll have to commit suicide. Sir, I beg of you, please start the bus. Sir, my husband is almost on the verge of dying. I have to take him to the hospital. - Madam, what can I do? I can start the bus only if the vehicles parked in the front move. Oh god! What can I do? Sir, the driver is not prepared to negotiate. Even the students are adamant. Move, move... - Don't beat us we are the reporters. Hey, the problem is between a student and the driver of that bus. Why has the traffic of the entire city been blocked? Who is the driver of this bus? Remove the bus. I'll not. Hey come here. You're a driver, aren't you? Yes sir. - Take the bus and clear the road. Hey, all of you move. Start, let me also see! You carry on. He'll get up. If you kill me, my caste people won't spare you? The whole State of Tamil Nadu will go up on flames. Let me also see, go over me. Come on, do it. Let me also see. Hey, How has caste come in between? Alpha calling control. Connect me to C.M. Urgently. Hello leader, I'm Palasami speaking. They have run over a bus on the driver who belongs to our caste. My blood is boiling. Are we of no consequences? We have to show them our worth. Immediately call for a strike. There should not be any movement throughout the city. Sir, the Commissioner is on the line. Tell me. Sir, the situation here has worsened. On one side, they say its the Ruling party. And on the other caste problem. It has become like a battle field. You are the Home Minister. If you permit us, we can stop everything within minutes. Hello, don't take any hasty decision. In this problem, one driver is from my party. And another driver is belongs to the Caste which made me win. The Students support is also important for me. That's why if you do any harm to anybody. I'll be in problem. It will harm me. Damn it. Only because of the fear of losing their support, such small letter pad parties & such Caste leaders, are holding the Government to ransom. If we don't take any action, they'll convert the city into a graveyard. Atleast give order to use tear gas and disperse the crowd. Hey, if I listen to you and issue Tear Gas order, Public will not disperse. My power will dissipate. That's because the four legged chair on which I am sitting, all its four legs are not mine. One leg is of the Alliance Party. Second leg is of the Caste leader. Third leg is of the Financier who finances the whole show. And the fourth one is of the Party Members. Even if we lose any one leg out of the four. We'll be made to bite the dust. We shouldn't end these problems. We have to play Politics through these. Mr. Commissioner, no tear gas & arrest. They'll shout for sometime and cool down themselves. Oh God! Check mate - You girls are playing Chess. Hey, why these two T. V's One for my 1st. Wife & the other for my second wife. You scoundrel! Robbing for your concubine? Exam. Would have started. My preparation has gone waste. Sir, the situation has gone beyond control. Everywhere shops are being broken, stoned, buses being damaged. Public property is being damaged to a large extent. We can't control, unless you give the shooting orders. Hey, if I had to give the shooting orders, I would have done that long back. Do you know, how big a problem can be created because of it. Instead let glasses break. I'll send that Caste Leader and Education Minister. Be patient, till then. He is fit for nothing. He can't take immediate decision. Oh my Godl Hey, look at this. My Godl - If he is left here like this he might die. Is there any hospital near by? There is one S. M Hospital, which is 1 km. From here. In the present scenario traffic will not get cleared. Alright, hold this. Hello, what's your name? Hello, Paremalakujalambal! - What! I am calling you only. Oh! I am not Paremalakujalambal. - Okay. Abithakujalambal. Oh! Not Abithakujalambal either. - Alright! Kunthravali! Hey! Don't tease me like this - You're not telling your name, then how can I call you? - You don't have to call me by name. Hey! Kunjaee! - Oh God! It's horrible Your name will be Kunjaee till you tell me your name. Go, go Thopla! - What! Thopla! If I am Kunjaee then you are Thopala. All are telling lies. Who is she? Come and watch the bioscope. In front of you all are telling lies. Oh! It's me! This is my present for telling the truth. There is no power for light, isn't it? - Yes. Did you like this? - It's not good. Why? - You've caught me crying. It's horrible. You've seen the pictures. Please tell me your name now. It is there in the picture see it. - Alright. Thenmozhi can't you keep your mouth shut. Thenmozhi! The joke is, that the student who was the cause of the strike, you all will be surprised to know about that student. Student, who was struggling for his life, our Q T. V cameraman. Admitted him in the hospital with great difficulty. Kumar, how are you? - I am fine. If you were late by few more minutes, you would have lost more blood, and then we wouldn't have been able to save you. Thank you, Doctor. Don't thank me, Thank him. Thank you. - All the credit goes to, Our Q T. V Cameraman Mr. Pugazhendhi. It's okay. Oh! Thopala! Hey! Why have you all gathered here? - All have gathered for you. Why are you shaking my hands? What's special today? Coverage of strike which was done by you. It has become very popular in the Network. They are repeatedly showing the coverage on every channel. Calls are coming continuously asking, who is Pugal, Who is Pugal? T.R. P rate has reached peak level. From today, you're not a Cameraman. You're a Senior Reporter. Take this. Thank you sir-Best of luck. Madam, milk... milk... Hey! Don't make noise, getting tickled in the hips. Name is Pugazhendhi, shooting Cameraman. Wow, so nice. Hey! She is mine. Go that side. - Okay. Oh God! - Hello. Hey! You stupid! You took photos when I am bathing, and you will telecast them and show them to the public. Show me. Show me all what you've taken. - Wait. I'll show you You thought I am a fool? - Oh! It's not like that. Alright, look at this. Move. Move man. Oh! Do I look like this? Why are you taking my photos? That day, you didn't like your crying photos, that's why. I want to show you, your beauty That's why I am taking photo's since morning. I thought of taking your photo's the whole day, in between, something bit my leg, and I shouted, you also shouted & the entire program collapsed. What's this? Thorn. Not thorn. It's a snake bite! Snake bite, where?! Oh! Snake has bitten you. Oh! Snake! What will I do now? For Snake bite, in your village, won't you suck it out? Don't be silly. You were clicking photo's without knowing the snake has bitten you. Your life is saved because that is not a Poisonous snake. If it was a poisonous snake... For your happiness, I can do anything. Will you do anything for me? - No Yes. You will ask me, "will you do anything for me?" I'll say "Yes" Then, you ask me to die. But I will not die. I want to live with you for ever. In front of all the people, without bothering about the Chief Minister, you told the truth. Similarly, you tell me the truth now. Tears of joy in my eyes... Because of you, I died several times. Thenmozhi, Thank you very much. I'll always be with you. You should not cry. My Thenmozhi should always be happy. Smile. Come on. Otherwise I'll click your photo when you are crying. Smile. Give a broad smile. Oh! Your crying was better than this. Superl... Okl Oh beautiful devill You're burning like fire in my heart. You're killing me by your harsh words.

Respected Chief Minister. Greetings sir. Greetings sir. Greetings. - Please, sit down. Excuse me. Are you going to interview me? - Yes sir. What's your name? - Pugazhendhi. Greetings. A special guest that I am going to interview today, not only our country, but the entire world, doesn't need his introduction. Greetings sir. Greetings. In every election, Public votes, with the faith that the elected C. M will do some good for them. In the end they feel cheated and disappointed. This is happening in our Government also. Sir, what is the reason for that? What are you saying? In every house, there is a Colour T.V. In every village, there is Dish Antennae. In every street, there is an S.T. D Booth & Internet. All are going on Two wheelers. In jewellery shops & Garment stores, there is a big queue of buyers. They are going to amusement parks & expensive restaurants. Not only that, they are wearing slippers & watches. The standard of living of people has increased. For the last 15 years, is there any news of people dying out of hunger & poverty? As you say, no farmer is going to a jewellery shop. No labourer is going to a restaurant. People who are earning illegally & taking bribes. Are only leading such luxurious lives. Rich are becoming richer & the poor, poorer. They are still being squeezed in buses and trains. The people are still standing in queues for Kerosene & Rice for hours. They are sending the children to school only for the nutritious noon meals. Sir, our children are still begging on the streets. Some people always complain. Brother! After I came to power the literacy rate his gone up to 62.5o/o. But sir, State of Kerala has achieved 100o/o. In industrial growth our state has come from 7th place to 5th. Sir, don't we have more respect for a Gold medal winner than a Bronze. People below the poverty line has come down from 39o/o to 32o/o. But, still in our villages, the average income of a man is still Rs. 3 only. Brother, you have to talk only when you are well aware of the statistics. Sir, just a minute. Sir, this is a report from World Economic Forum. This is IMF report. This is from Amnesty International. And this is from human rights commission. This is World Bank's report. The Credit from World Bank has not reached the people properly, And your ministers have gobbled up all the funds, saying this they have cancelled the next instalment also. Brother! You don't know? The World Bank people have almost asked for the mortgage of our state. Putting conditions. What are those conditions? Would you specify them? That's not for you. I'll tell it to the people. The people are watching. Please tell me. Why did the World Bank stop the funds which we should have got? It's a 1000 pages report. There are annexures. Pay Rs. 15 and get a copy from Secretariat. And then read it leisurely and explain it to the people. Next question. Sir, were you from an affluent family before entering Politics? No, I was from an ordinary farmer's family. Oh! What is your salary? - What?! What is your salary? After all deductions, I get about Rs. 18,000. Say that's! About Rs. 2 Lakhs per year. After addition and deductions your total earning till now. May not exceed 25 lakhs. But, today you own properties worth 800 Crores! How did you acquire those properties? Cat on a Hot tin roof. This is a false accusation. If you want to, you can file a case against me in the court. I'll come to the court and prove myself to be innocent. Case?! In the past 10 yrs, pending cases awaiting prosecution are 14 lakhs. This delay has emboldened the criminals to do more crimes. I am not saying this... This Human Rights Commission report is saying. Do you remember this? I remember having seen it. Your election manifesto! Don't your remember it? How can I forget it? I was the one who wrote it. Every promise, I can remember by heart. To form a castless society. To maintain peace & law and order. To protect women. To distribute the basic commodities at a reasonable price Free education to all. There was a spelling error there I know it by heart. Do you think all these have been achieved? Are you saying that we haven't achieved them? You are saying that you'll maintain peace & law & order. But, you are the man behind the chaos in Law & Order. You said you'll form a caste less society. But, you are the one who instigates caste conflicts. Brother. Are you questioning me with an intention only make me angry? That's not my intention. People should know the truth. Please have a look! Stop all the buses running in Tamilnadu. Will you go over me? If you run over and kill me, will my caste's people leave you? Whole of Tamilnadu will burn. A driver stops his bus on the road and creates a traffic jam. If asked, he says he is from the ruling party. The traffic police are unable to take any action against him. Another driver falls in front of the wheels and threatens in the name of caste. Police Commissioner is unable to do his duty. And when you were asked to order action, fear of losing that caste's support, you remained silent without taking any action. Whole Tamil Nadu was burning. You were not bothered about it. Lot of people were affected, but you were not bothered about it. Loses were a staggering 300 crores but that's not important for you. Your sole aim was not to lose your seat of power, isn't it? To make this interview a sensation and make a name out of it, You shouldn't cast aspersions without evidential support. I have the evidence. In this one driver belongs to my party. Another belongs to a Caste which was instrumental in my election wins. I need student's support also. Whomsoever you lay your hands on will lead to more trouble. That will affect me. They'll shout for sometime and disperse. Heyl If I wanted, I would have given the shooting orders long back. Do you know how much more trouble it would have created? Don't bother about breaking up of a few glass windows? You just keep quiet. Now, come out. Aren't you more concerned more about your seat than the welfare of the people? Come on & tell me. What happened? What's going on? Aranganar has been made speechless! Hey! You come on reply to him. He's blinking. Very nicely cornered him. Switch off. I'll kill you. Tell him, to switch off. Hey! Is this the way to Interview? Stop the camera. Stop the camera. Hey! Baldie! I'll hit you with my slippers. Stop the programme. I am warning you, stop it! Are you still interviewing? I'll kill you. Hey Palavesham! Pan the camera to the control room. A person here is showing his slippers. I'll burn down the T. V station! Cool down. - Oh God! They're picturising even this. Hey! Brainless! If this had been the legislature, we could have expunged the remarks from the house records. This is a live telecast, the whole of Tamilnadu will be watching it. Throw down the slippers. Will I also be seen? Why only you? You, with slippers in your hand, the dung in your slippers, everything will be seen. You imbecile! Throw it down! Unable to bear the stench! Shit. He wants to become an M.P. Brother! Will you please make way? Sir, will you take the light? Leader! Discontinue the interview and get up. That's all. Interview is over, isn't it? Greetings! Sir! The interview is not yet over. It's a live relay and the people are watching. You've not yet answered my questions. So please sit down. You have dubbed it very nicely. You have dubbed my voice with someone who has the same tone, and trying to mar my reputation in public. I don't have to reply to all this. I had only videographed that strike. How much bribe did you take from the opposition party? How much did you pay when you were in opposition? With a mike in hand and a T. V station to boot. Wearing a coat, you'll ask anything, for that, do I have to answer it? Answering them is your duty. For that only, 6 Crores people have elected you. Do you know what does a C. M's position mean? Did you ever step the threshold of the C. M's office? Come and see. How many people come to meet me in a day? So many petitions, solicitations... thanks giving, crisis... felicitations, agitations... problems... tensions... he who sits there knows them. Nothing can be decided on the spur of the moment. If a disturbance breaks out, we'll have to foresee, and take a decision, which will not affect anyone in future. I have done only that! The problem that could have been solved easily, You wantonly made it to grow bigger for your personal gains. Now, don't give silly reasons. I am saying that, if you put your finger in the fire, It'll burn it. You are not able to understand it. You put your finger and see only then you'll understand. One day... For one day you become the C.M. Then you'll understand. This is not the correct answer. How can I sit in your seat? It may be good for argument's sake, but, is it possible? It is possible. There is a provision for it in the Constitutional law. I can issue an ordinance to that effect. You see it for yourself for one day. Me? You are joking. - I am saying it seriously. For one day you sit on my seat. My seat is a bed of thorns and a crown of thorns. You'll understand. What can be done & what cannot be done? You'll understand clearly, how difficult is the C. M's position. Go and explain it to the people of this country. Say "Yes", say "Yes". Say "Yes"... say "Yes". What's this? They are playing a one day match with the C. M's seat. Our C. M is talking silly since his visit to the State of Bihar. No sir, that's not my job. Look, you are backing off from the Challenge! That's it. Never play silly with a National leader. When given a responsibility, you'll back off but always question. That's it! When a person like you is given a responsibility and challenged directly, you are backing off. What? Will you try it for a day? It's a live relay, people are watching. Come on reply. Shall we stop this interview? Yes sir, if it's a possibility, then I am ready. One day, I'll be in your position and see. He got stuck as he challenges the general body meeting. Okay, let it be. Let me atleast in my life work with an educated C. M for a day. Okay brother. Victory to India. Hey move... move. Excellent. Pugal! My dear friend. Excellent job. Silence... silence. He has simply asked him to become C. M for one day. Please tell us, whether it is admissible in law or not? - It is. There is a precedence. When the assembly is not in session, we can do it by an ordinance. Otherwise. - Say it. Sometimes ago, in Bihar wasn't a C. M appointed temporarily? In Delhi, after the death of a leader, Wasn't the son appointed as the Prime Minister? After the death of leaders it's usually done like this. When a C. M went for a bye-pass, it had happened like this. Once it has happened in this State also. To appoint a person as a C. M for one day, Does he have the authority or not? In accordance to the discretionary powers of the Chief Minister, the fundamental rights are enshrined in the constitution... Hey! Don't talk in English. Tell me? Is it possible or not? It is possible. By using your discretionary powers, and notifying in the gazette it can be done. Leader, what's this? Because it is possible, should anybody be appointed as the C. M for one day. Poison can be drunk but should it be drunk? Why to take this risk? You don't know, this is a game of politics. That day, when so many people were watching the T.V., he said, I was giving importance to caste vote. That's why during the strike, he cornered me saying that I didn't take action on anyone. What will you reply? Can I accept the truth? They will hit me with slippers. Tomorrow I can't face the Public for votes. That's why I challenged him. Suppose if he does something on that day. He can't do anything. Before he comes to know the duties of C.M. That one day will be over. You see, he will go mad & run away. Two birds in one shot. Because one person has blamed, this Araganathan has given up his post. And this will enhance my image. It is easy to blame others. But doing something is difficult. Public will understand this fact. Leader, whatever you are saying it may be true, agreed. This is my resignation letter. For appointing Mr. Pugazhendhi as the C. M for one day, this is the letter from 145 M.L. A's supporting him. I, N. Pugazhendhi, as by the law & constitution of India, accept the post of C. M of Tamil Nadu, Under the law of Indian Secrets Act, I accept to protect all Government secrets that come to my knowledge. I give my assurance. Greetings viewers. C.M. Of one day is taking charge, In the history of Indian Politics, This is the first time that such a live telecast is being shown. To telecast this, the State is crowded with all the National Channels. So come on let's go. Counsellor himself is coming in a 'Contessa'car. And the C. M is coming in a Public transport. I think, the country has definitely progressed. Please come. Why are you disturbing him, he has just arrived. Till yesterday you were an ordinary T. V reporter. Even without your expectation suddenly out of the blue, for one day, you are sitting on the C. M's seat. How are you feeling about it? You'll have to excuse me. I am not sitting here for giving an interview. I am thinking of doing something creative and constructive. Please co-operate with me. Okay... Thank you so much for your love. Listen to what I say. I want to immediately see all the officials from I.A. S & I.P. S departments. Make the arrangement. Make it fast please. - Move... Greetings to one & all. Sir, he is Anand Krishnan I.A.S. I am sorry. I have no time for introductions. Yeah please, coming to the point. There are people responsible in stunting the growth of this country. One, those who aren't abiding by their assigned duties Two, those who become a hindrance, while others perform their duties. Three, those who're misusing their authority. Criminal to escape from his crime, by threatening, by apple polishing, by luring, Or by giving the other a share of his bribe, are washing away their sins This starts from an ordinary peon. I am sorry. And reaches to the levels of I.A. S, I.P. S Officers and also to the Ministers. There is no one who punishes them, Nor there is any fear among them of getting punished. On such people, the complaints that have been registered, And the action on it, Which has still not been taken, all those files, within an hour's time should be brought to my notice. Make a phone call, send a Fax, Telex, go by a taxi, or by a helicopter. I don't mind. But one hour... just one hour. Within 1 hour, I need to get the list of such people. And if I don't get it, I've to add your names to the list also, I mean it. Excuse me sir, what are we going to do with that list? I am going to suspend all those people. Okay, the meeting is over you may all go. Great! He hit a sixer in the very first ball itself! Sir, what's this? You have also come to the slums Like others are you also going to give rice, tooth powder, Sarees etc... No. I believe that there shouldn't be any slums in our country. Our Politicians also think in the same way. And they burn the slums. Come here. Government has allotted a separate place for you. And it has also built houses for you. Even after that, why do you people stay here? Sir, there are 350 huts. They've allotted only 2 houses. What about the others? Where would the rest of people go? Who is the director responsible for allocating these? Here he is, come fast. How many houses are allotted for this slum? - The thing is... Hello, reply promptly, houses! This man says only few houses have been allotted. What about the rest? Gone with the wind. Sir, half of the place allotted to them has been taken over by the Politicians. And in the rest of the place houses were built. Most of the houses are taken by the members of ruling party, and persons like him having the authority. This man must be having 20 flats. Apart from that if they allot the houses, they let them out on rent & stay here. Here he is, Ezhumalai. Even he has been allotted a house, but he has let it out on rent to someone for Rs. 1000- Hey. - Shut up! Inspite of knowing all this, why haven't you still taken any action? Sir, there is pressure from the Ministerial level. Sir, they are the ones who cast their votes Which educated person is casting his vote? They give lame excuses, sit in the house and watch TV. If they are driven away, will they not lose their votes? That's why they're totally ignored. Okay, Where is the typewriter which I had asked for? You'll get it. Hey come fast. What's your name? Type his suspension order. - Sir, What are you saying? Sir don't do it, ask him to stop. Ezhumalai, come here. In which area you were allotted a house? You come with me. - Okay sir. In this slum, to all those people who have been allotted houses, get all those huts vacated and come with everybody to Velachery. - Yes sir. Sir... You are suspended. - Sir, please sir... Ezhumalai, which is your house? The first house on the ground floor. Who's it? Chief Minister... Chief Minister... Oh I see, come in, do you want tea? Hey, we don't want anything, whose house is this? It's my house - What's your name? My name is Ezhumalai. If you are Ezhumalai, then am I Bill Clinton? Lmmediately, vacate this house & hand it over to him Sir, why should I vacate, I have given money! Look, this house has been allotted to him. According to the law, your staying here is a crime. We'll have to take action against you if you don't vacate the house at once. Then you'll be behind bars. - Alright sir. Sushma, take out everything we'll go to Sowcarpet. Immediately he remembers his place. In the same way, check all the other flats. Sir, I've brought everybody. Okay, you do one thing... Ask those people to vacate who are illegally staying here, and make these people stay in their respective houses allotted to them. From now on they'll only stay here. Hey, one day C.M. Long live. When we go away from here, and if you let it out on rent & stay in the hut, I'll rip you apart. Are we really interested in staying in those huts by choice? Many of our family members are jobless. We survive on the rent that we get from the house. Sir, to eke our livelihood, if you make any arrangements for a job, Sir, god will definitely bless you. A request to the natives of the State. My holding the post of a C. M for day is known to everybody If I have to do something good, I need your co-operation. What you all have to do is, on this one day Whatever commodity you buy, whether a match box or a car, whether Gold or a Diamond, a hair pin or an aeroplane, anything you buy, buy only after paying the tax. If the shop-keeper doesn't make the bill ask him to make it. This tax goes to the Govt. You must know how much money is collected in a day. If you buy goods at less than the actual price without bill, the tax which should be utilized for public welfare, goes to the sellers as black money. So, I request everybody to pay the tax. If anyone refuses to give the bill, lodge a complaint at the nearby Police Station. Rs. 350. - Hey, make the bill & give. - Oh shit. This applies to the business men. If anyone of you do business without making a bill, Your licence will be cancelled. Make sure such contingency doesn't arise. Besides if you pay your earlier dues today itself, I'll cancel all the charges against you in sales tax evasion cases. Hey, what is the sales tax amount that we've to pay leagally for a day 40 Lakhs. - How much are we paying? Only 4 Lakhs - That is what he is asking for. Pay it otherwise he'll cancel our licence. - Alright sir. Hey, What is he up to? What is his idea? He is totally raw. If he collects only the Sales Tax is that enough? He is building castles in the air. You've it. Hey, Finance Minister. What is the income from one day's Sales Tax? For the party or for the nation? For the nation. - I don't know. Shit, you're a bloody Minister. Stop eating, get up & get lost. Sir, did you see. Catch him, catch him, catch him. Hey, what's all this? - Magnet. Sir, the lesson he learnt in his school about the magnet power. How well he is using it? Look, how people's brain work. What will be its weight? - It should be around 200 gms. Hey man! If you are under weighing 200gms for 2kg, With this weight how much you would be stealing in a day? Will you reform? You blood sucker! Hey! What's this? What's all this? - World cup! Whichever side you measure, it will measure only 2.5 litres! He is a expert in pilfering kerosene. Catch it. Sir, after calculations he's swindling about Rs. 1500 per day. He is earning more than the C. M in a month. Hey! Whose money do you think it is? It's these people's money! Look at these street rag pickers, maid servants, laboureres, milk sachet suppliers, It's the hard earned money of all these poor people. Sir, what should be done to this man? Tell me. Hit him with slippers! Cool down, cool down! Sir, the people are very enthusiastic. If we hand him over to them, they'll measure him with his weights & measures! No we'll have to dismiss him from his job! Hey! What's your name? - Sir... Is "Sir" your name? Come on tell your name! What's your name? Look at the names they have? Get out. Hello C.M.

Eve teasing here has reached in tolerable proportions. Boys from the neighbouring slums are teasing the girls. It's been happening everyday! Which is the nearest Police station? Police? We have reported to them many times. They are afraid to take any kind of action against them. I am coming over there right now. Instruct that area inspector to be on the spot. - Okay sir. t. Driver! Take her immediately to the nearest hospital. Take her immediately. Who called me up from here? - Sir I called What had happened to that girl? A rogue trying to hold her hand injured her.

It's a small accident, these girls are blowing it up. No sir, they are lying. Please be quiet. Hey you keep quiet. Come on you carry on. In the nearby Kasi slum there are few rogues. Their full time job is to to tease girls. Their boss is Alan, a big rowdy. Who's involved in political murders. They never take any action against him because of ruling party's support. On that strength, those scoundrel's are misbehaving with us. Every time they're patting our backs. It's really disgusting! Please. Don't you feel ashamed of listening to this? Aren't you being paid for catching them? Useless fellows. Sir, police cannot enter into that area. Those who had gone like Head constable, constable, Inspector, They have killed them. Why? Haven't you been given a uniform? Haven't you been issued a weapon? Sir, the commissioner has curtailed my power. Sir, the minister has restricted my power. Everybody. Mr. Mayakrishnan, without omitting anyone put everyone in the list. Don't leave anyone. Which one is Alan's house here? If you go straight first house on the left. Hey!

Women are like our eyes... women are like our eyes... Mr. Mayakrishnan! What about the sales tax collections? Sir, very high collections. All the treasury's of Tamilnadu have more then 260 Crores till now. - Fantastic! Do one thing. Use all the collected money for the poor slum dewellers. To create job opportunities according to their education and skills. Okay sir. It's a very good idea. Sir, what happened to the list that I had asked for this morning? Sir, It's ready. It's divided separately district wise in the order of its seniority. These are those who didn't do their duties properly. These are those who interfere in others doing their duty. That are those who misuse their authority. Sir, totally there are 46518 persons. Suspend everyone indiscriminately. It'll be night before we can sign these papers. We have a very short time. Issue an omni bus order! Put it on the internet. Like the examination result, put it on the notice board. They all should be suspended. I'll issue orders empowering all the collectors for suspending them. Sir, there are some Collectors also in the list. Then for them you sign the orders. - Okay. If your name is in the list then I'll sign your order! - Oh no sir, I'm clean. I am just a little talkative, other than that... I don't even use a pencil of the office. Sir, even the cell phone bills I am paying from my salary. On what strength so many people have committed there mistakes? Only on the strength of Ministers of all those departments. Because even they get their share. Which are the Ministers involved in this? Revenue Department, Housing Board Food and Public Works Dept. Totally department's Ministers are involved. Sir, what shall we do with them? Actually, they should be arrested! - Then do it! Pugazhendhi Down Down... Pugazhendhi Down Down... Look leader. He has come here also. Your 12 ministers have indulged in corruption. We have evidences for that. Excuse me. I've no other option other than to arrest them. If you lay your hands on anyone I'll kill you. Ask them to come in. - Yes sir. Hey! Do you want your corpse to float in Coovum river by tomorrow? That isn't so easy. All the Press people are watching. Please advice them to extend their co-operation. You can proceed now. Constable, break open the door Sir, I just came to the loo. Leader, what's this? I haven't achieved or effected any social reforms. I have just abided by the duty of this post. If you had done this in the last 5 yrs., our country would have become heaven on earth. Thank you so much for your advice. Your one day is over. You can go. Still there are five minutes to go. There is one final work, which I've to complete. You are the root cause for so many people to commit mistakes. You are totally responsible for those people indulging in corruptions. That's why, I am arresting you also. Don't talk like a kid. You don't know the law. It's not a joke to arrest a Chief Minister. For that, Governor's signature, Supreme Court's permission, and other formalities are required. Don't talk without knowing the details, get lost. Excuse me. Today I'm the Chief Minister. And you're just an ordinary man. I have all the powers to arrest you. Arrest him Oh my god! This was not at all in our list! My dear, your good time has started. Pugazhendhi down... Hey, move, move, enough of taking the photo's. Please make way. Please move a little way. Leader got trapped us by his strangle talk. If he comes back to power, I'm dead. I thought he can do nothing in a day but he has put the whole lot behind barsl Release our leader. Release our leader. Heyl Remove your hand. Release our leader. Release our leader. Keep quiet. We'll get him released soon. Advocates move to the front. You're all lawyers move to the forefront. Sir, lawyers have come. Lawyers? When will you get me released? He'll put me in a Central Jail before dawn. So do something immediately. We have done all the work, all you've to do is sign these papers. We'll go to the Magistrate's residence & come back with the bail. - Take that. And more importantly, get a stay on all the orders issued by that one day C.M. Get a stay order to make them ineffective. - Yes sir. I'll issue an ordinance and make all his decisions null and void. Shall I leave now sir? Go and get the bail immediately... go man... Hey You, Maya Krishnan! Got struck. Where are you sneaking out? Come here. Sir, it was very paining for me to see you in this position. So, I was avoiding you. Don't cry and deceive me! I know, you were with him & adviced him in everything, isn't it? I swear on you sir, I did nothing like that. I was going around with him just like a puppet. Blind man! Had he been illiterate he wouldn't have understood anything. He was educated enough to understand everything in one day. He is clever. Don't play double game with me. By dawn, I'll be the Chief Minister, do you remember? Oh my god! I am a family man don't take revenge on me. Shall I arrange someone to throw acid on his face? Say yes, I'll arrange it. We'll forgive him & spare him. No sir. We'll have to do something. What's this sir? For a small scratch, you broke a man's hand. That guy had hurt you emotionally, And you want to forgive and leave him. Left him... but didn't forgive him. A small boy... Has eclipsed my years of political life. For all his one day's achievements he should be consecrated, with Milk, Honey and BLOOD! Screwing up means this is the best screwing up. Screwed up all the people at a time. That's called the real screw up. Even after requesting you never turned up for work. But yesterday's screwing seems to have worked out. You have come to work so early. What?! Beedi? - No Soda water?! If that man becomes the Prime Minister of India, He'll cleanse the whole system. Hey! He's our one day Chief Minister. Why are you standing sir? Sit down sir. What happened sir? I fell into a sewage slush. If you pour Soda on him When will you clean him up? No Water man. He cleansed Tamil Nadu in one day. We should clean him in one minute. Heyl Our one day Chief Minister has arrived. Leaderl Leader, Chief Minister Lion, shake hands. You have achieved. Move out. Pave the way. Beat the drums. Carefully... carefully... slowly... slowly. You may throw him down. Bring him down. Go... All of you move out. Let all the evil eyes cast on you be warded off. You have done a wonderful job. Congrats. Now, I am no more Sensational Subha. You are the Sensational Pugal. Son! Arrest of Mr. Aranganar was your master stroke. Hey! One day Chief Minister has come. Greetings Leader. Greetings Sir. - Hey keep quiet. Brother! Spread and hold your shirt? What? Hold my shirt? Spread your shirt and hold. - Why? To measure Paddy. With your one order, without any broker in between, you have made the government buy all the stocks directly from us. After deducting all the costs and labour, for a hectare, we are getting a net profit of 5 thousand rupees. After the harvest the first measure is offered to God. But, now you are our god. Please don't flatter me. Our hearts are overwhelmingly filled. Take this brother. Take it brother. Take it brother. What will I do with this paddy? Offer it to God. Brother! - Hold it! Brother! Even then, for the respect you have bestowed on me... Are you happy? What will my Thenmozhi give me? With great expectation I have come running. Why are you hiding your face and leaving from here? Hey! What happened? Why are you crying? They gave you paddy and raised your status to that of god. What can I give you? They say that, life is priceless, but I will not give my life. I want to live with you. Modesty is more than life. Take it. Thenmozhi! What's all this? I don't have anything more precious with me to give you. The paddy they gave is not important but the honour is. The way you gave yourself to me is not important. But the trust you have in me is more important. That is enough for me. Hey slim girl. You're the one who dissolved me in your vermilion. When you apply turmeric on your body, dear you remember me. Oh dear, you convert me into your anklet's bells. Oh slim girl, you've dissolved me in your vermilion. When you apply turmeric on your body, dear you remember me. Oh dear, you convert me into your anklet's bells. One eye is shedding tears, and my lips are craving for the life. I live and die frequently because of you. Like the leaf which drops on the river, and is carried away by the same river, my heart is following only you. Even on forest trees flowers are blossoming. Oh slim girll You've dissolved me in your vermilion. When you apply turmeric on your body, dear you remember me. Oh dear, you convert me into your anklets bells. By staying in my eyes, you're making me restless. Oh jasmine flower, you have never talked smilingly... You grabbed my words, by the lip to lip kiss. Till now, your warmth on my neck had not diminished. I'm not fair like you. Even your toe finger isn't black. The places you touch will become sweet. Another half of my body should get that boon. Oh slim girl, you've dissolved me in your vermilion. When you apply turmeric on your body, dear remember me also. You convert me into your anklets bells. Oh dear, you hug me tightly once and stop my breath. Oh my love, there's a time to search myself in you. Your talk drenches me. Your sight burns me. Will they be everlasting in my life? Your soul is with me how can you die? Am I not present in your soul? Even god of death will be confused while taking your life. Oh slim girl, you've dissolved me in your vermilion. When you apply turmeric on your boldly, will you remember me? You convert me into your anklet's bells, Will you do it? The corruptions in Aranganar's rule, when exposed by the one day Chief Minister has lead, the alliance front's party leader Mr. Tirupathi Samy. To withdraw his support from the Government. Following this Mr. Aranganar's Government has fallen. Fresh Elections have been announced. Heyl Look at a rat pulling an elephant. In the forthcoming polls, who do you think will form the Govt? We voted for him because the previous Govt. looted 300 crores But this man has looted more. As if the ruling front's partner was very honest, It pulled the strings at the right time. A real opportunist. Again if we vote and bring them back, They'll squeeze us. We don't want the repeat of all those things. If a new person comes, it'll be very good. If you ask me, that one day Chief Minister Pughazendhi, should come back. Pugazhendhi is the right person. For Pizza its Italy. For Noodles its China. For Chocolates its Switzerland. For clean rule its PUGAZHENDHI. Only Pugazhendhi. It'll be Rama's rule. - It's A.R. Rehman. It's M.G.R. We want Pugazhendhi's rule. My Pugazhendhi. We want Pugazhendhi. Pugazhendhi! Bugger! We want Pugazhendhill We want Pugazhendhil I'll take care of him. Hello greetings sir. Congratulations! - Why sir? Pugal, I least expected this. The whole state is agog with your name. Come on get down quickly. Sir! I am not interested in politics. I'll always stand by you. Don't be scared. Look! This is a rare opportunity. Sorry sir. I am an ordinary man. With ordinary wishes. All I need is 8 hours of sleep. Flower like rice cakes and mint chutney. A game of cards with my loving parents. A contented job. On Sunday watch Titanic, Breakfast at Saravana's. And a beautiful ogre in Pooncholai Village. That's more than enough for me sir. Sir, now my only aim is to secure a Govt. Job. For that only, I am studying for Public Service Commission. Hey man, the Govt. Itself wants to be yours. And you are trying for a Govt. Job. Is it the same man talking, Who achieved so much in one day? Sir, we'll always find fault with the cooking at home. One day, they'll challenge us to cook. We'll accept it on a Sunday and achieve it. And it may turn out good. But, Can we cook daily? We can't. Because, cooking is not our work. Then with a pad and pencil. Do you know only to ask questions? Sir! That's my duty. I am asking the questions, which the people want to ask. As their representative... Is it the end of it? Don't you want to come and stand by the nation in good or bad times? I'll stand by the nation, as a follower. Not as a leader. I'll fight as a citizen, but not as a Chief Minister. Hey you! What do you think of yourself? You'll do something good and awaken the public, and then make people to look forward for your entry into politics. With one voice if we call you, You'll say, I'll go to see Titanic, I'll have breakfast... Hey you! Who has barred you from having breakfast after you become C.M. Hey! Why are you going back & running away? They have come. On every T. V channel they have mentioned your name without exception. Go and hide somewhere. Hey Look. - Hey are you the next C. M? Listen to me! - What do you think of yourself? Are you the next C. M? Are you the Sensational Prabha? Come I'll Sensationalize you. Help me please. What? What? - Give me a good pose. I'll shoot. Come, shoot. Shoot it in 70 mm. Come shoot... Mike is broken, take that light in your hands. You want me to take the light, You son of a Cockroach. Oh! My god! What a beating? Hey! You swine. Come, let's go. Let him die. Kalyani! Is water coming in your tap? - Yes. Then, why isn't it coming in our house? What's this? Even power is also off? What's this everyone's house is having power? Damn it! Even the telephone is dead! I'll go and lodge a complaint! How many offices will you go to lodge the complaints? Sir. - Sir, who are you? We are coming from Corporation Office! - What's it? You have transgressed the rules and regulations of the Corporation, while constructing this house! What are you saying? Look. You have encroached upon Govt. Land by 1 foot and 8 inches. We have been ordered by the commissioner to demolish it. It has been there like this for 17 years! What has happened now? Did you ever serve us a notice? We have served a notice last month, itself. What can I do if you don't receive it? Sir... Sir... Sir... - Look, don't disturb us! Stay away and co-operate with us. Come on, you start your work! - Ask them to stop! Please... Oh! God they are demolishing. You can stop it, if you wish to. I curse them. They will be ruined! Oh God. Its gone! It's gone! You sinners, my chicken! Take care! Get down safely! What's this? Why is he getting down from an ambulance? What happened to him? Why is his head extensively bandaged? Nothing! There was a small problem in Q T. V? The wounds are small, only the bandage is extensive. Why? Why is this happening only to our family? They have stopped water, power, phone... Not only that, those murderous sinners have demolished even our house. Because of your one day's Chief Ministership, they are beating us with our hands tied. Mother, don't worry! Father! Take mother inside! I am not going to take it lying down! They barged into Q T. V and beat me at the behest of Aranganar. All are his hench men, I have seen them with my own eyes. Palvesham! You go and call lawyer Sundarajan. Stop! What are you going to do? Are you going to file a case. Great Idea! There are 14 lakh pending cases in Delhi, you only said in that interview. It'll take at least 25 years for your case to get over. Before that your lawyer Sundarajan will get beaten twice. Till now how many cases have been filed against politicians. Has any politician ever been prosecuted and sentenced? Before the case gets over he'll rule and enjoy the power and die. Only bugs will crawl on those files! For that, do you want me to spare him? I am a media man! I'll call all the T. V channels and Magazines and tear apart that Aranganar. They tore apart Q T. V, haven't you seen it? Sir, What was the mistake I committed? Doing good itself is a crime in our country! I had taken an interview. Was it my mistake? It was my job! It was an accident, that I became a Chief Minister for a day. Actually what was to be done by the ruling people, I did just that on that day! Everything was over with that day. I have returned to my ordinary daily life. I am just an ordinary man. Sir, why are they still chasing and hurting me? Who said that you are an ordinary man? When you sat on that seat for a day. That day itself, you had become a politician. Politics is like drugs! Once you are hooked to it you are gone. Tomorrow, if he wins he'll use police to beat you. If he loses he'll use his hench men to beat you. You can never escape from him. Then, where is the end to it? Either, settle down with your family some where near Poona, Or else plunge in Politics! No, I don't want Politics! This is the winning point for the Politicians. Those who should question them never do & keep quiet. That's why, these Politicians are creating so much of chaos. This is the curse on this country! The famed bad man of movies P.S. Veerappa said it rightly. "LET THIS COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE BE RUINED" Hey Auto stop. Oh! The leader has got up! Come on get up, get up... Hey! Don't photograph me? News may reach higher levels. Sir, Its just a photograph! - Man! I may lose my job! Don't I have to be in this job, at least till this man comes. What are you doing here? I couldn't stay away so, I had to come back. What have you decided? Let him get up and brush his teeth! Move, leader has to go to toilet, move... move... Stay away from my waist You swine. Go, go. Move... move... make way ... go... go. Hey! Stop... Stop... Greetings brother. I am the opposition leader Vaduganathan. I think you know me. I knew you'll come to the bathroom. So, I was waiting for you since morning. Brother, our party has 40 MLA'S. They'll sign wherever I tell them to sign. Today you join our party. Who will be the next Chief Minister? Will it be you or me? We can decide after discussion in the general body meeting. Brother... I have cash in the van! Totally 100 'C'- 100 'C' means?! 'C' means 100 Crores! Yuck! What sort of men are you? Not allowing a person to go to toilet and fix rates! You go... stop. Why this garland for going to the toilet? Is he going abroad? He is just going to the toilet. Why do you bother him so much? You go. Greetings Pugalji. What? Pugalji?! Why are you changing his father's name. Give it to me. We are coming from a National Party. Join our party, you will be the next Chief Minister. From Delhi, 500 'C' has come as your growth fund. You inform our leader about your acceptance on phone itself. What? 500 Crores?! Pugal, give me that income tax number... Palveshji... formality for me too. If you talk to Pugal and get our work done. We'll pay you 2 C. - You! Swine! Long Live Leader Tirupathisamy! Long Live. I am Alliance Front Party Leader, Tirupathisamy. You need not enter Politics. All you have to do is just issue a statement that you support us. We'll accept you as our spiritual leader. The way you ruled for a day, We'll continue it. Brother! - Who's that calling our leader as younger brother? Who is that? - Brother. - Oh! Agricultural Party! Come. Greetings. Come... Saw on T. V that you were beaten up. Seeing that, Thenmozhi has been distressed. I couldn't see her distressed. So I brought her here to meet you. Nothing has happened to you, isn't it? - I am okay, Thenmozhi. Come, with me, I have to talk to you alone. They are discussing important family matter. Don't disturb... I was distressed hearing your name from everyone on T.V. I was afraid that all of them may push you into Politics. Don't enter Politics. Once if you enter, you can never extricate yourself from it till death, Or lead a peaceful life. I am not saying this with any self-motives. But as a parent I am advicing you. Before you decide, think once about Thenmozhi, who always thinks about you only. Pugal, I like this girl very much. Without further discussion marry her. We'll settle down very far away, beyond the reach of these Politicians. Hey, Palvesham move. - I won't. Now everything is under my control. You Swine. You have become an eminent person. Do you know how many people are waiting for you, just for your one "YES". By dumping crores of rupees in a van. They have come to bargain your rate. The opposition party on one side, The Nationalist Party on the other. And since you got badly hurt, and not being able to bear it, The youngsters are ready to lay down their lives, gathered on one side. And on every channel of the TV, public chanting your name is on the other side. And above all, this is the latest turn on the platform of Indian politics. Why only India, the CNN, BBC etc. The whole world is waiting for your reply. What have you decided? No... no please... please stop. I beg all of you. Right now, I am not interested in saying anything. Look, I am just an ordinary man. I am already fed up after getting beaten up. Just leave me alone. Hey, move. Come. Come here and look at the crowd. Pugal, has this crowd gathered after getting money? Or have they been given liquor or fish & chips? This crowd gathered on its own. Look at the curiosity on everybody's face, will a good leader not come? Will a good government not be formed? Will a good future not come into vogue? Look at their desperation! Today, invariably everyone wants to become a Doctor, Engineer or a Lawyer. Is anyone ready to become a Politician? If asked, they say Politics is a dirty game. If its so, they should clean it, isn't it? Instead, handing over the country in the hands of dirty politicians, They have got used to the muck. What do youngsters want? Just think? A good job and a beautiful girl to marry. And till 45 years, after saving money in installments, buy a small land away from the city, build a house in 800sq. Ft and paint it in yellow colour, and then read papers like Indian Express or Hindu, and die thinking only about "My family, my life & my children". Get lost. Would Mahatma Gandhi also had thought in the same vein, if so, would the country had ever got its independence? If Thomas Alva Edison would have thought like this, would the country had ever got Electric power? If Graham Bell would have thought like this, Then nobody would have had ever spoken on a telephone or a cell phone. Even a small worm like the silk worm gives silk and then dies. We are after all human beings. Who is he? What is the relation between him and you? Why should he wait for you from 5 'O' clock in the morning? Son, why have you come? Our country is also crippled like me. Leader, make it stand tall and walk. Greetingsl In the polls, people's party leader Pugazhendhi, has won with record creating vote margin. Candidates belonging to his party have won in all their constituencies. With an absolute majority, it has created a new record. All the candidates of all the parties, who opposed him in the elections... First time in the History of World Politics 97% voting has been recorded. For the first time a 28 year old guy has become a C. M of a state. Candidates of all the parties who contested against him, have lost their deposit. It is history in World Politics... Best wishes from beautiful devil. Greetings to everyone! What, I expect from you people is that, What I did in one day, we should all make it permanent feature, and to do that excellently, I have appointed 2 Ministers in each department. An intelligent veteran! And a zealous young man! We have Laws for everything, but they are all ineffective. They'll leak, till there are holes in it. Till the mistakes are being committed, However good administration we may give its a total waste. First, we should identify the mistake committed in every corner of this State, and rectify them immediately. We have to punish the wrong doer. For that I am going to introduce a new scheme. Complaint Box. But, we have a complaint register in all the departments. Then, why are the mistakes being committed? Because, its beyond reach. Not only that complaints registered there, go to the same concerned authorities, who never take action on it and close the file. It has become an ineffective customary symbol. But, this Complaint box will be there in every street of Tamil Nadu. If water doesn't come in taps, or if electricity fails... If roads are in bad shape. Adulteration, bribes... Not only I.A. S, I.P. S or Ministers, even if I commit a mistake, people can make a complaint without getting scared. Action will be taken within 24 hours. Maximum 1 week, to rectify any difficult problem. For this, I am going to start a new department. That'll be "COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT". It'll be under my direct supervision. The day, when complaints thin out & complaint boxes become redundant, only then we can say that the administration is good. And to achieve this we are going to dedicate ourselves. A green horn, in one election has screwed up all our political lives. Till, he runs the govt. We have to keep off Politics. We'll have to go back to our villages to start business afresh. That, isn't very easy. On his instructions, Enforcement Directorate is after our black money. He must have been a bandicoot in his previous birth. He's dug up all the old files and has registered more than 800 cases! He'll not rest till he puts all of us behind bars at the earliest. We'll have to precede him. There is no other way than to assassinate him. Sir, what? Didn't you say there is a party in Bombay? Not one sir, there are many. Like acid throwers, stranglers, poisoning specialists. Injecting needles, Bomb specialists... Get the Bomb making specialist. That's best suited for our terrain. And also its very easy to throw the blame on others. Pugazhendhi has sent me to give you this present. Oops! Cell phone to a rustic village girl! C. M is on the line, press OK button and speak. Hello... Hello. I'll go, you carry on. Hello. - Thenmozhi, How are you? Do you still remember me? Don't kill me Thenmozhi! On assuming duty, I had received many bouquets from P. M, President... But the one sent by you, a rustic bouquet. You don't know, how much happiness it had given me? How much I was fretting and fuming to meet you? Nobody is there to stop me. But, I couldn't get rid of myself from my responsibility. I had telephoned many times at Chettiyar's house. Your father hanged the phone saying you were out of station. That's why, I have sent you this cell phone. You can talk to me, whenever you wish to, on this cell phone. Will you never ever come and see me again? I'll come on Sunday. I'll be waiting for this Sunday. There are 6 nights and 5 days, I fear something might happen by then. My father is seriously searching a Govt. Employee groom in the vicinity. Like a Post man, Lines man Health Worker, Mill Inspector. I am under constant fear. Don't worry! - Software Technologists are waiting for you. Okay! I'll speak to you later! Hello. - I have to speak to him. To him, means who is him? There are 36 "Him's" here. Why even I am also a "Him" only. Which, "Him" do you want to speak to? I am Thenmozhi speaking! Thenmozhi, why didn't you say it earlier that it was you? I have arranged all that. - Sir call for you. Who is it? - Ogre! Tell her that I'll speak later. He's busy, he said he'll speak to you later. Hello, C. M's. Special P.A. Palavesham speaking, I am Thenmozhi speaking! Thenmozhi, I am Palavesham speaking! Are you fine? Damn with your enquiries! Call him first. He is in a very important meeting. After the meeting, I'll inform him that you had called. Go to hell! You never inform him! He has never called me back. I am feeling miserable without him. A C. M's job is like that... His time no more belongs to him. Try to understand. Subscriber you're calling is not reachable at the moment. Please try again later. Oh chief minister... chief minister... Oh chief. Look at me. Don't you've time for romance? I'm worried after coming to the edifice of our love. Won't I have the relief of your kisses? You're hearing the sound of weapons. Why can't you hear the sound of my bangles? Oh chief minister. Oh chief minister. Allot some time... and write notes on my shoulders. I'll sign on your heart with the ink of honey. You allot money for the welfare of the country. You allot some time to me to make my life happy. There is prosperous life for the chief minister. You're an exception for that. Oh leaderl I belong to you. Oh chief. Oh chief. You opened Mosques & schools. But don't you've time to enter my bedroom. I've relaxed curfew & exempted tax. Then I should dispense your dresses. By leaving your sweet heart in distress, Are you visiting places with your ministers? If I wipe off your tears, Will there be flow of water in the taps of people? Oh rulerl Will you look at me? Chief minister, look at me. Don't you've time for romance? After coming to the edifice of our love, Are you worried? Relief of kisses... - I will. When the sound of weapons stop, I'll come to hear the sound of your bangles. Oh chief. What was that sound? - Father nothing! Take it out. Who gave it? He gave it. - Who? He... He has left you for politics, why are you still enamoured of him. Who's that? "MUMBAl" Ohl That bugger from Madrasl Ohl Chinnasamy come. Please carry on. Accusing the former C. M Aranganar to be behind those caste conflicts, you had dethroned him from the post. Are you planning to do away with castes? - I'll tell you. In Tamil Nadu, there are totally 350 castes. But, in my administration, there won't be so many. I am going to amalgamate them into four. I didn't get it. In future there won't be any column for caste in the application forms. There will be just 4 divisions. SC/ST/MBC/BC/FC. All you have to do is to mention which part you belong to. Excuse me, by this the reservation and job opportunities of the oppressed class, will be snatched from them? All the castes of Tamil Nadu will come under some part, isn't it? Yes! - What more do you want? There won't be any changes in their customary benefits. By this you may lose support of many caste associations. I am not bothered about it. Everyone is afraid of losing the support of caste associations. Today, any good work can't be taken up with courage. Now, these caste associations have sprung up like petty shops, and are scaring people at large. I am not a person to be afraid of all these things. Whatever is good for this nation I will do it. What is the aim of this drastic action? After 25 yrs, the future generation will not know which caste they belong to. The generation coming after me will reduce its number. Atlast there'll only be one caste left. That'll be "HUMAN" Thank you. Control from alpha. VIP about to start now, over. Mr. Manohar, I am going to the village on a personal work. Why so many cars? You could have arranged a P. T car? Sorry sir, whenever you go all these cars have to follow you. It's wrong to spend so much on my security. The mistakes and the unnecessary expenses committed by former C. Ms., should not be commited by me. And do you know something? In W. Bengal, the C. M has travelled by bus! You know, isn't it?! Sir, don't misunderstand me, You have a threat on your life. That C.M. May not have. So, we have to provide you with "Z" Category security! That is our duty. You've property to this State. Your life is more important to us than your privacy. Today, you are travelling by the third car. Okay! I am not going anywhere. VIP trip is cancelled redirect all securities to station, over. Hey Thenmozhi. Nobody is observing. Hey the standard is one foot blue metal and 1/2 foot of minute blue metal. 2 inches of Tar and the road should be rolled 5 times. The road laid by you should hold for 5 years. If potholes appear, we'll make potholes on your head. This is our brother Pugal's administration. Keep it in mind! Yes Mr. Public. Did you look at our position? Everyone is coming and threatening us! Where ever my son goes it's all flowers & fragrance Excuse me lady. Give me five arm length of "Caste" Jasmine garland! After our brother Pugal's rule castes have vanished. Ask for just Jasmine, I'll give! - Okay give me. Oh God! I forgot to bring money! Can I give it, on my next visit? Is it okay for you? Even known faces are deceiving. I don't know your face. I am a known face. Oh my god! He is Chief Minister! Don't shout! I have come on a personal visit. Please, don't reveal it to anyone. Sir, he has come to Pooncholai village. In a disguise with blue turban yellow shirt and silk 'dhothi', over. You keep watching him, I will come immediately. Take this! - Thank you. Damn it. There's no photographer in the vicinity. Brother, autograph this. A man rich in thoughts & deeds. If you have promised to come on Sunday then you must come. You keep up all the promises given to the people. But, when it comes to wife you'll deceive. What sort of a man are you? Anybody at home? - Nobody. Then, who's talking? Ghostl Stop there, who are you barging in? What do you want? Not barging in Madam, I have come for some sweet nothings! Why are you talking with some motives? I have come here with some "intentions" What will you do? Peel off your lips, a bite below the neck. To seize your waist with mouth, and a small rape! Okay! Go ahead. Oh! You sinner! You deceiver! Hey! Thopla! Can't I recognize you if you wear a turban? Take it off man. What's all this disguise! Thenmozhi! Now I am not a Chief Minister. No files, no Police around, no siren I am just an ordinary man. I am your lover! This day belongs only to you. Order me to do anything? I'll do it for you. Thenmozhi! Now I am feeling very hungry. Hey! You sinner since you didn't turn up. I didn't buy chicken. Only left over rice is there! - That's enough! There are no side dishes. When you are here, why do I need side dishes with rice? Salty dry fish and left over food. You're there to feed them to me. By kissing you on your forehead, I want to die lying on your heart. Salty dry fish and left over food. You're there to feed them to me. By kissing you on your forehead, I want to die lying on your heart. Shall we catch a chameleon? Shall we share a mango? Fishes, which jumps in the rivers... and the grass which grows in the slush. You come and dance along with me. Shall we take bath as nudes? Get rid of your shyness. Past and future are false. Only present is true. Let both of us have feast from one leaf. You're crossing your limits. What're you murmuring in my ears? I'll tie the knot & present you with a blouse matching your size You start your love ploys. Salty dry fish and left over food... you're there to feed them to me. By kissing you on your forehead, I want to die lying on your heart. The forest, where only air can enter... in the Loxia bird's nest... You allot a place for me to stay there. Even if you steal my saree, I'll cover it by my hand. Clothes are false. But their worth is real. You put all your beauty on my hand. My heart is beating drums... You fulfill your wish through proper channel. The real thing will be in the joining of two souls. Salty dry fish and left over food. Do you want me to feed you? By kissing me on my forehead. Do you want to die lying on my heart? Salty fish and left over food. You're there to feed them to me. By kissing you on your forehead. I want to die lying on your heart. Shall we catch a chameleon? Shall we share a mango? Thenmozhi! I am very happy today! How nice it will be if we have 2 Sundays in a week! You are the C. M isn't it? - Yes You can grant yourself any number of holidays for you. You don't have any authority over and above you. That isn't true. People are my Superior Authority. I am just a worker for them. So sweet... - You too... You have managed even your adamant father for our marriage. What next? Marriage at the next auspicious time. I'll present you turmeric & with a blouse matching your size Sorry sir, even without your permission, It's my duty to save your life. Look back! Down! Attack! Move fast. Come. Leave him. - Come on. Everything is under control now. - Go fast. Come fast. Clear that stretcher. I never expected it. You may have selected this life of playing with death, but I and my daughter don't need such a life. Father! He... Even after all this, if you still wish to marry him only, let him leave all this and come as an ordinary man. I can tolerate you as a spinster all your life, but I don't have a heart to see you as a widow! What's this father? Reversal of roles! I should press your legs! You have come back from death! Let me at least touch you and feel. For that, why do you want to touch the feet? Didn't I do this when you were very young. Now, you have lot of tensions. Let me massage your legs so that you can have a peaceful sleep. Come on sleep. Henna! Shall I apply henna on your palms?! Mother, It's been long since I slept on your lap. How nice it'll be, if all my life passes off like this. No C. M... no security. How nice it'll be if we have a rewind button in life like a VCR. Mother, why are you crying? It's been long since we had a talk. I feel you have gone far away from us. Mother, you talk... What else will I talk except your marriage? What did Thenmozhi's father say? He's also interested, but... Father, cut that phone call. You and your father come, we can talk it over and finalize it. Maya Krishna is on the line. May be something very important. I am Maya krishnan speaking. Hello! Not able to get the signals inside the house! I'll move outside and talk to you. Please be on the line. Hello! Sir! I am able to listen properly now. Pugall Just now we have received an intelligence report. A bomb has been placed in your house ask everyone in the house, to move out immediately. What? Mother. Father! Mother! What's this? What's all this? Mother! Mother! Mother, the henna which you have kept on my hand has not yet dried. Before that... Mother! Mother! Father! Father! Please come back. If we also had a rewind button like a VCR in our life. How nice it would had been. You are a happy man! Dear... Hey, you... Don't do it, brother! Leave him, brother, leave him. Brother, leave him, don't harm him leave him. On being appointed as Chief Minister I, N. Pugazhendhi. To safeguard this nation and its people, I promise to be beyond the personal prejudices. You, you, what did my parents do to you? You have torn them into pieces! I want my father's hands which took me to school. Where is my mother's breast which fed milk to me? Where is it? You... where? Mother, everybody bury's the dead! Or cremates them. But I have come here after washing away my parents ashes. And the reason for that is... your husband. Is it that easy to hold a CM's post? Didn't you do something very drastically? There are people who may not like it. Like Caste Associations, Extremists Foreign Hands, there will be enemies like them. Tomorrow if anything happens you may accuse me... Hey! Don't act smart. I know perfectly that its you! Stop all pretensions. The law will come to get you. Maragatham, he's dishevelled my hair. Give me a comb. Chinnasamy! Before he arrests me his govt. Should fall. Wherever they see there must be Strikes Riots, Communal Clashes, here and there bombs should go off and people should die. Law and order should be disrupted. You sinners! To the respected Chief Minister. For the past few days, Some suspicious people had threatened us and stayed in our house. I have gathered from their talks, that they may be involved in big crimes like bomb blasts. Before they commit any dangerous crimes, I request you humbly to take necessary action. From a person who wishes for your perpetual good rule, and not interested to reveal the name, a citizen. My god! Hey You! Where did this letter come from? No... We don't have time for that! First arrest that Chinnasamy. Okay sir. Maya krishnan? I have told you to arrest Chinnasamy and interrogate him. Why did you call me here? As soon as he sensed that we'll be arresting him, The fatso intelligently complained of Diabetes and B.P., and got himself admitted in this hospital. They have made it a style of getting admitted in a hospital. Look at him, sleeping like a corpse in a well. We have to enquire an important matter. Please, can you co-operate with us? He's acting as if he has just passed out of Poona Institute. Sir, please excuse me. He has got high B. P, high Sugar, and also Chest pain. That's why, its not possible for him to speak. Oh I see! Besides being a lawyer you claim to be a doctor too! No, I have his medical certificates. Please, don't disturb. - Okay, I understand. Right now, he is under what treatment? There was a small wound in his leg, Because of high Sugar, gangrene has formed. They gave him an injection on the spinal cord, They have cut one of his legs. Oh my god, where is my leg? Oh my god, where is my leg? Sir, the sugar has again increased what will they do? Nothing much, they'll cut the second leg and keep it in the Delhi Museum. Sir, please don't disturb the patient Kindly leave him alone. Hey, Lawyer, shut your gob and get out from here. Sir don't believe him I am perfectly healthy. Before dying, people will be bright & shiny like you. You have sugar, B. P and all the ailments that are in the medical records. Sir, all those are false certificates. Don't believe them. Get out. Now, with civility tell me, where have they planted the bombs. Tiger Balm, or Zandu Balm. Joke! And you expect us to laugh at it. Bloody rascal, we'll tear you apart, tell us. I swear, I don't know. Chinnasamy look, you are caught red handed. You have given a false certificate that you have high sugar. If we cut your leg or hand nobody will bother, tell us. Brother... - Touch any of these fingers. This one is for what? - To cut your hand. This. - To cut your leg Then this. - For that... Oh my god! Don't cut any of these I'll tell you. - Fast. I'll tell you... We have planted them at 4 places. In a bank at Mount Road, Railway station, in a marriage hall & in a cop's bike. Wow! I've got back my leg. Can we do business by keeping your leg, you keep it. Then can I take rest? - Yes of course, but in the lock up. At once, contact the bomb squads and ask them to go to the spots. And one more thing, call up the Police control room, And ask them to park all the cop's bikes in a sterile area. Okay sir. - That's it. Sir, did you find anything? - Nothing, as of now. Shit! - Sir, you go, we'll do it. No... no... I've to examine it myself, come. No... Come on. Son, don't move. Wait... Hold him, be careful! Cool... Check, and go back... go back... There is a bomb inside the hall everybody move out. Listen to me, keep all the doors open, take out the ladies safely & properly. Sir, to besmirch the Govt. Of Pugazhendhi, It seems, you have planted Bombs at 4 places. He'll himself plant the bomb, and he'll himself defuse them, and he'll put the blame on us. How is it possible? Not a single planted bomb would explode. He'll defuse the bomb correctly before it explodes. The opposition party which is fully united. They are scared that it may come in power again, that's why he has hatched this conspiracy. But, the one which was planted in his house, didn't kill him. Didn't you understand its implication! To upstage his political image, he didn't hesitate even to kill his own parents. Sir, your reply. Look, there will be an enquiry. You yourself planted the bomb to kill your own parents... No... no... comments... Why did you ask me to come? Hey look, I never aspired to sit on this chair. Neither, did I snatch it from you. Lakhs of people came searching for me to my house, with the faith that I'll do something good for them, they cast their votes for me and made me to sit here. I intend to do some thing good for them, But you... You are not allowing it work out. Do it fearlessly, do it, I am not stopping you. You are not stopping, but you are putting spokes in it. You use your brain to destabilise ruling party, Even if you had used 1 o/o of it for public welfare, Our country would have developed long back. You'll always create problems like Strikes Caste conflicts, Bomb blasts... Do I've to think about the welfare of the people, Or follow the trail of the bombs planted by you? From the very beginning you have been accusing me! The Police is under your control. File a case against me. Set up an enquiry commission, if you are able to prove your allegations, hang me! Am I stopping you? I know how a spineless politician will try to escape from the law. You cannot escape from me, okay? I am going to kill you! You are not able to handle me, isn't it? You don't have to show compassion towards the life of a mosquito. 30 yrs of my political life I have spent eating flesh and leaving shells behind. Now I have come to your place, everyone outside knows about it. Only we both are here. You cannot escape that easily after killing me. You have 30 yrs experience. Add to this my 1 year of acquaintance with you, So I have become 31 yrs. Experienced politician. Now, I am going to shoot... Not you but myself! Guards! You have made me a fool! Now you die! How can I sit in your seat? It may be good for an argument but is it practically possible? It's possible! Why don't you be there for a day and see it for yourself? That was a good interview. Mr. Krishnan! At last they have made even me a Politician. Sir, forget it. He had always indulged in dirty politics. You have indulged in it only once for a good deed. You keep quiet. You didn't tell me anything and I didn't hear anything. You Sinner! How unjustly you have shot him? How's that? Son! I am ignorant about other things except agriculture. I was concerned only about the welfare of my daughter. But, you have sacrificed your own parents for the sake of others welfare, And there is no one besides you to take care of you. I bless you!
