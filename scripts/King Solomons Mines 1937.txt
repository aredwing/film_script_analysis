IT HAD A VAST, UNEXPLORED INTERIOR. I WAS A HUNTER AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE YEAR 1881 THAT I LEARNT THAT THE MINES WERE A STARK REALITY. I SAY "WERE" BECAUSE THEY NOW LIE BURIED UNDER A MILLION TONS OF ASHES AND LAVA. AT THE TIME I'M SPEAKING OF, DIAMONDS HAD BEEN FOUND IN KIMBERLEY. MANY ADVENTUROUS SPIRITS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD... YOU'VE STRUCK LUCKY AGAIN, RED. YES. YOU CAN COUNT YOUR MONEY TOMORROW. I'LL HAVE 5 POUNDS ON ACCOUNT TO GET DRUNK WITH. [Laughing] GET YOUR BACKS TO THE WALL, THE WHOLE BOILING LOT OF YOU. DON'T SHOOT, BOYS. IT ISN'T A HOLD-UP. I'M JUST TENDING MESELF AND THE TREASURES OF ARABIE. CAST AN EYE OVER THAT, ME BOY, AND SEE WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND? A HOUSE, CARRIAGE AND PAIR FOR ME DAUGHTER AND THE LIFE OF RILEY HEREAFTER AND EVERMORE. DID YOU EVER SEE THE LIKE? A NICE PIECE OF CRYSTAL, O'BRIEN, BUT NO DIAMOND. YOU DON'T MEAN IT? I'M SORRY, MISS KATE. THAT'S BAD LUCK, PATRICK, BAD LUCK. BAD LUCK NOTHING. I WAS ONLY HAVING A JOKE WITH YOU. COME ON, GIRL. [Donkey braying] TRY AGAIN, PATSY. DEVIL I WILL. I SPURN THE DIAMOND FIELDS UNDER ME SHOES. IF WE COULD ONLY GET TO THE COAST, I COULD GET A JOB TEACHING. AND WOULD YOU LIKE IT? I WOULD NOT. [O'Brien] OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T. LISTEN, THERE WAS A MAN IN THE BAR LAS NIGHT FROM THE CONGO. HE SAYS THERE'S A FORTUNE IN IVORY. THERE'S BEEN A FORTUNE IN EVERYTHING WE'VE TRIED, BUT IT WASN'T US WHO FOUND IT. FROM NOW ON, WE'LL BE DECENT, RESPECTABLE CITIZENS, AND WE'RE GOING TO THE COAST BEFORE I CHANGE ME MIND. HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE WE? LESS THAN A POUND AND ALL OUR TRAPS ARE IN THE PAWNSHOP. WHAT'S THAT YOU HAVE? FOR YOU, A GIFT I BOUGHT TO CELEBRATE OUR MAGNIFICENT DISCOVERY. A SHAMROCK! FOR LUCK. IT DIDN'T COST A THING. I KNOW WHAT IT COST. THERE WERE TWO IN MULLIGAN'S STORE. HERE'S THE OTHER FOR YOU. KATHY, ME GIRL, THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING TO BEAT IT. WITH A BIT OF SHAMROCK APIECE, THERE'S NOTHING ON EARTH CAN HOLD US DOWN. LOOK! GLORY BE TO GOD, STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN. ASK HIM FOR A LIFT TO THE COAST. IT'S A 5-WEEK JOURNEY. IT'S A LOT TO ASK. AND YOU CALL YOURSELF AN IRISHMAN? IT'S A FINE MORNING. [O'Brien] IT'S A FINE MORNING. IS IT? IT IS. ARE YOU GOING TO THE COAST? NO, KITSFONTEIN. WELL, THAT'S ALL ON THE WAY. WHOSE WAY? OURS. WE WERE WONDERING IF YOU'D GIVE US A LIFT. NO. ME NAME IS KATHLEEN O'BRIEN, AND THIS IS ME FATHER, PATRICK O'BRIEN, BACHELOR OF ARTS, TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN. THANK YOU. BACHELOR OF ARTS AT TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN! A DOWN-AND-OUT FROM THE DIGGINGS, HUH? WE'RE DOWN BUT WE'RE NOT OUT. [Quartermain] YOU'RE OUT AS FAR AS MY WAGON'S CONCERNED. OH! SO YOU DON'T APPROVE OF US? I DON'T APPROVE OF TEARING UP THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY FOR GREED. ME DAUGHTER IS A GOOD COOK. I HAVE A GOOD COOK. ME FATHER'S A WONDER TO TALK. YEAH, HE WOULD BE. [Kathy] AND HE'S A LOVELY RIFLE SHOT. JUST THINK OF THE GAME HE COULD GET FOR YOU. [Laughter] WHAT'S FUNNY IN THAT? QUARTERMAIN, BEST HUNTER IN AFRICA. THAT ENDS IT. IT DOES NOT. MR. QUARTERMAIN, YOU NEEDN'T TAKE US IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, BUT HERE'S SOMETHING FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT IN YOUR PRECIOUS SOLITUDE: ME FATHER'S OWN SISTER IS DYING IN KILKENNY AND IF THEY NEVER MEET THIS SIDE OF THE GATES, 'TIS YOU THAT WILL HAVE PREVENTED THEM. JUMP UP. [Spiritual singing] HOW MUCH LONGER? ANOTHER 10 DAYS. LOOK! [Kathy] AH, THE PRETTY CREATURE. YOU STARTLED HER. MAYBE SHE KNOWS THAT IN 10 DAYS YOU'LL BE AFTER HER WITH YOUR MURDERING GUNS. I'LL GET YOU A KNIFE. YOU DON'T LIKE HUNTING? NO, I DO NOT. NEITHER DO I. THEN WHAT DO YOU HUNT FOR? A LIVING. IT PAYS ME TO RUN HUNTING TRIPS. I'VE GOT 2 CLOWNS WAITING FOR ME NOW. THERE MUST BE A LOT OF MONEY IN HUNTING. I'VE BEEN THINKING OVER WHAT THAT FELLA SAID ABOUT IVORY. HAVE YOU HAD ANY EXPERIENCE IN TRACKING GAME? HE ONCE TOOK PART IN A BADGER HUNT, BUT THE BADGER ESCAPED. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO TILL YOU TRY. WHILE YOU'RE TRYING, YOUR POOR SISTER'S PEACEFULLY PASSING AWAY IN KILKENNY. ALAN QUARTERMAIN, IT WAS A LIE ABOUT ME FATHER'S SISTER. I KNOW, I'VE MET THE IRISH BEFORE. I'M GLAD YOU OWNED UP. AND WHY SHOULDN'T SHE? SHE'S GONNA SETTLE DOWN AND TEACH SCHOOL. YOU'RE GOING TO SETTLE DOWN? OF COURSE I AM. I SUPPOSE THERE ISN'T ANYTHING IN THE IVORY TRADE IS THERE? IF YOU ASK ME, THERE ISN'T A PIN TO CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU. THERE'S A WAGON ACROSS THE RIVER. NO. ANTELOPE PROBABLY. I'M SURE IT'S A WAGON. CAN'T BE. AND WHY NOT? THERE'S NOTHING ACROSS THAT RIVER BUT DEVILS. THAT'S WHAT THE NATIVES SAY. IT'S UNEXPLORED LAND, DESERT PROBABLY. IT MAY BE THE DEVIL'S, BUT I CAN SEE A WAGON. COME ON! [Shouting] TAKE THIS. WATER, QUICK! WHOSE WAGON IS THIS? HE'S NOT ABLE TO TALK. IT'S THE DESERT. INSIDE. [Man whispering] [Shouting in foreign language] THAT'S ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE LOOKING AFTER HIM. THE OTHERS RAN AWAY IN THE NIGHT MANY DAYS AGO. THE FEAR WAS ON THEM. SURE, THE DEVIL. HE FELL ILL. WE COULD NOT REACH THE NORTH. HELP HIM BACK TO CAMP. I TURNED BACK. HE DOES NOT KNOW. LET ME GO ON. OUT OF THE WAY. YOU CAN'T GO ON. YOU ARE ILL. DO I CARE IF I AM ILL? I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING BUT-- YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE I'M GOING BUT I TELL YOU, YOU CANNOT FOLLOW. I CROSSED THE DESERT. AFTER THE DESERT, I FIND KING SOLOMON'S MOUNTAIN. AFTER THE MOUNTAIN, I FIND KING SOLOMON'S MINES. DIAMONDS. SYLVESTRA, WHEN YOU SEE ME AGAIN, I'LL BE THE RICHEST MAN ON EARTH. SO, OUT OF THE WAY! [Mumbling incoherently] [Gasping] DID YOU HEAR THAT? THE MINES OF KING SOLOMON OVER THE DESERT. IS IT TRUE? TRUE, WE HAVE HEARD OF THE MINES. [Quartermain] GET ME SOME WATER. [Speaking Kukuana] ALL THE JEWELS OF OPHRAH AND NO ONE EVER DISCOVERED WHERE OPHRAH WAS. THAT'S WHERE IT IS MAYBE. [Quartermain] KATHY! MY MEDICINE CHEST. ALL RIGHT. [Speaking Kukuana] WHAT'S THAT YOU HAVE? A MAP. LOOK, 300 YEARS OLD. HE SAID A MAN WENT THERE AND NEVER CAME BACK. LOOK, THE WAY ACROSS THE DESERT AND HERE, KING SOLOMON'S MOUNTAIN AND THE MINE. THE JEWELS OF OPHRAH, THE GREATEST TREASURE IN THE WORLD! NOW, THAT MAP IS HIS. YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TAKE IT. I KNOW, BUT IF HE LIVES WE WON'T USE IT, AND IF HE DOESN'T, I'LL SEEK THE TREASURE MESELF AND I'LL HAVE MASSES SAID FOR HIS SOUL. THE SHAMROCK! I SAID IT'D BRING US LUCK. [Quartermain] KATHY! I'M COMING. DIG A GRAVE. [Speaking Kukuana] [Chanting] ALL OVER? GOD REST HIS SOUL. KATHY ASLEEP? IT MUST BE TERRIBLE TO DIE ALONE IN THE DESERT WITHOUT YOUR FOLKS. TERRIBLE. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE MAP? HOW DID YOU GUESS? I KNOW HUMAN NATURE WHERE TREASURE'S CONCERNED. WHERE'S THE HARM? I RETURNED IT. AFTER TAKING A COPY. WILL YOU BE SENDING THE MAP TO HIS FOLKS? AND PROVOKE SOMEBODY ELSE TO LOSE HIS LIFE? BESIDES, HE HAS NO FOLKS. HAVE YOU LOOKED OVER IT? DO YOU THINK IT'S GENUINE? IT'S UNEXPLORED COUNTRY. NOBODY KNOWS. YOU'RE LOOKING AT A MAN WHO MEANS TO KNOW. YOU'RE NOT GONNA TAKE THAT GIRL-- WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR? I'M HER FATHER, NOT A MURDERER. I SHALL GO ALONE. IN ALL ME LIFE, I MAY NEVER GET ANOTHER CHANCE LIKE THIS. OF DYING? OF FINDING AN EXCUSE FOR HAVING BEEN BORN. YOU'LL THINK ME A CASUAL KIND OF A MICK, WHO DOESN'T CARE A CRUST IF I'VE A SHILLING IN ME POCKET TO BUY A MEAL FOR ME OWN FLESH AND BLOOD, BUT IT'S THE WAY WE IRISH ARE, TO TAKE OUR TROUBLES WITH A SMILE IN OUR TEETH WHILE UNDERNEATH, THERE IS DEEP SHAME IN ME HEART. DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OWE TO THAT CHILD ASLEEP THERE? I DO KNOW AND HERE IS WHERE I MEAN TO PAY THAT DEBT IN FULL. WITH YOUR LIFE, HUH? IF GOD WILLS IT, WITH ME LIFE. HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO MAKE THE JOURNEY? HASN'T PROVIDENCE SENT ME A TEAM OF OXEN? AND A WAGON, AND STRENGTH AND PURPOSE TO CARRY ME TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH? YOU KNOW, O'BRIEN, THERE'S ONLY ONE KIND OF MAN THAT IS USELESS TO ARGUE WITH. AND THAT IS? A FOOL. EH. [Men speaking Kukuana] INKOOSI, OUR WAGON, WHERE IS IT? I'LL TAKE YOU ON. AT LEAST YOU'LL BE SURE OF FOOD AND A WAGE. KATHY, WAKE UP! I DO NOT WORK FOR MONEY AND YOU DO NOT GO MY WAY. [Quartermain] KATHY! ALL RIGHT. ALLAN QUARTERMAIN, HE'S GONE AFTER THE TREASURE. I KNOW. WITHOUT ME. ME, WHO LAY DREAMING OF THE WAY WE'D GO TOGETHER. DID YOU EVER HEAR OF SUCH A THING? [Quartermain] HURRY UP, THEY'RE STARTING. YOU'RE HEADING THE WRONG WAY. AREN'T WE GOING AFTER ME FATHER? NO. BUT-- PUT ON YOUR BOOTS AND GET INTO THE WAGON. I TOLD YOUR FATHER I'D LOOK AFTER YOU. YOU KNEW HE WAS GOING AND YOU LET HIM GO BY HIMSELF. ALLAN QUARTERMAIN, WILL YOU TAKE ME AFTER ME FATHER, PLEASE? WE'LL LOOK FOR THE MINES TOGETHER. AND WHEN WE FIND THEM, YOU'LL HAVE YOUR SHARE AND MORE, MUCH MORE. DOESN'T A FORTUNE MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? ALL RIGHT, IF YOU WON'T TAKE ME IN YOUR WAGON I'LL GO ON ME OWN 2 FEET. DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID? I DID. THEN WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING? [Quartermain] BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT. THE INKOOSIKAS GOES ACROSS THE RIVER. YES, I DO. WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS? THE INKOOSIKAS HAS THE MAP. I GUIDE HER. THE MAP'S IN MY WAGON. NO ONE'S GOING ACROSS THE RIVER. KATHY, GET INTO THAT WAGON. GET INTO THAT WAGON! WHAT'S YOUR NAME? I HAVE MANY NAMES. ONE'LL DO. UMBOPA. WHERE DO YOU COME FROM? YOU'RE AFTER DIAMONDS. WHITE MEN CARE FOR DIAMONDS. THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO NORTH? MOVE UP. [Speaking Kukuana] NOW, LOOK HERE, UMBOPA. IF YOU WON'T TAKE SERVICE WITH ME, I DON'T WANT YOU HANGING ABOUT MY CAMPS. [Speaking Kukuana] THAT FELLA'S UP TO NO GOOD. ALLAN QUARTERMAIN, I'LL NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN. NEVER! I'M USED TO SILENCE. [Shouting] [Man speaking Kukuana] [Quartermain speaking Kukuana] MY CLIENTS ARRIVED LAST NIGHT. IT'LL BE QUITE NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO TALK TO. GEAR IN HERE. WE'LL USE THIS WAGON. HOW ARE YOU, QUARTERMAIN? HOW ARE YOU, SIR? I'M AFRAID I KEPT YOU WAITING. THIS IS MISS O'BRIEN. [Henry] HOW DO YOU DO? DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TREK? NO, I DID NOT. DON'T MIND MISS O'BRIEN, SIR HENRY. SHE'S STRONG AND SILENT. THE MAP IS IN THE WAGON. HOW DID YOU GET HERE? INKOOSIKAS DOES NOT FORGET HER PURPOSE? GOOD WILL INSISTS ON HAVING HIS BATH. NO REASON FOR BEING UNSANITARY, EVEN IN AFRICA. QUITE RIGHT. WELL, I'LL SEE YOU BOTH AT DINNER. YES. HOW DO YOU GE OUT OF THIS THING? YOU BETTER ASK SIR HENRY TO TIP YOU OUT. RIGHT. NO, NO-- [Mumbling] SIR HENRY. SIR HENRY CURTIS. SIR HENRY CURTIS. WILL YOU HELP ME, PLEASE? I'M IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE. MR. QUARTERMAIN WANTS ME TO SEND THE WAGON NORTH SO THAT THE BOYS CAN HAVE CAMP READY WHEN YOU ARRIVE BUT THEY WON'T OBEY ME. MUTINY, EH? GLORY BE TO GOD, I THOUGHT IT WAS A PIG. COMMANDER GOOD, ROYAL NAVY. RETIRED. I'LL GO FETCH QUARTERMAIN. AH, NO. PLEASE DON'T. I DON'T WANT HIM TO KNOW I'VE HAD TROUBLE. WILL YOU SPEAK TO THEM? OF COURSE I'LL SPEAK TO THEM. BY THE WAY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE STRONG AND SILENT. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE MR. QUARTERMAIN. HE'S A TERRIBLE LIAR. GENTLEMEN, THE QUEEN. GOD BLESS HER. WITH YOUR PERMISSION, I'LL LIGHT UP. AND WITH YOURS I'LL RUN OVER A FEW OF MY PROPOSALS. I TAKE IT YOU WANT TO GET A SABLE ANTELOPE, SIR HENRY. IS MISS O'BRIEN OFTEN AS LATE AS THIS? SHE'LL SHOW UP WHEN SHE'S HUNGRY. SHE SEEMED TO ME TO BE A CAPABLE YOUNG PERSON. HMM--YES, CAPABLE OF ANYTHING. SHE'D HAVE STOLEN ONE OF MY WAGONS IF I HADN'T KEPT ME EYES OPEN. [Quartermain] ANYTHING WRONG? I TAKE IT IT'S IN ORDER FOR SIR HENRY TO TELL YOUR WAGON BOYS TO OBEY THE YOUNG LADY. WITH THE RESULT THAT YOUR WAGON IS NOW PROCEEDING NORTH TO ESTABLISH A CAMP. BUT SHE TOLD ME-- MY BOY, I'M AFRAID YOU'RE THE VICTIM OF A WOMAN'S WILES. WE MUST GO AFTER HER. WE CERTAINLY MUST. MY ONLY TOOTHBRUSH IS IN THAT WAGON. SHE HAS 3 HOURS START. IT'LL BE 2 DAYS BEFORE I GATHER A TEAM. SHE TOLD ME THOSE BOYS WERE MUTINOUS. I'M AFRAID, SIR HENRY, THAT IT'S MISS O'BRIEN WHO IS MUTINOUS. WILL YOU HAVE A LITTLE MORE PORT? I'M NOT AFRAID I'M NOT AFRAID WHY SHOULD I CARE IF MY JOURNEY'S LONG I'M SURE TO GET THERE THOUGH MY JOURNEY'S LONG MY TEAM AND MY WAGON ARE STRONG [Playing harmonica] STRUGGLE ALONG STRUGGLE ALONG OXEN OF MINE TILL YOUR SHOULDERS CRACK KEEP PLODDING ALONG TILL YOUR SHOULDERS CRACK I'LL NEVER BE TURNING YOU BACK WALK, WALK OXEN OF MINE ANSWER MY WHIP WHEN IT FALLS WALK, WALK KEEP IN YOUR LINE LEOPARDS WAIT TO GET THE ONE THAT FALLS GET UP AND WALK WALK, OXEN OF MINE SHINING AS BRIGHT AS THE MOON WALK, WALK KEEP IN YOUR LINE THERE WILL BE A WATER HOLE SOON WE'LL COME TO THAT WATER HOLE SOON WALK, WALK YOU BETTER KEEP ON THINK OF THAT SUN IN THE SKY WALK, WALK HURRY ALONG OR THE SUN WILL DRINK THAT WATER DRY GET UP AND WALK, WALK STRAIN AT YOUR LOAD THOUGH YOU ARE WEARY AND SORE WALK, WALK KEEP TO THE ROAD SOON YOU'LL BE RESTING ONCE MORE SOON YOU'LL BE RESTING ONCE MORE WALK, WALK OXEN OF MINE ANSWER MY WHIP WHEN IT FALLS YAH, YAH KEEP IN YOUR LINE LEOPARDS WAIT TO GET THE ONE THAT FALLS GET UP YAH, YAH OXEN OF MINE SHINING AS BRIGHT AS THE MOON YAH, YAH KEEP IN YOUR LINE THERE WILL BE A WATER HOLE SOON WE'LL COME TO THAT WATER HOLE SOON LA-DA-DA-DA LA-DA-DA-DA LA-DA-DA-DA DA-DA-DA-DA-DA DA-DA-DA-DA DA-DA [Quartermain] YOU'RE 9 MILES NORTH OF THE HILL, HEADING FOR THE DESERT, IN A STOLEN WAGON. AND WHAT'S LEFT OF MY TROUSERS. [Quartermain] YOU'RE COMING BACK TOMORROW. MEANWHILE, COMMANDER GOOD WOULD LIKE HIS TOOTHBRUSH. YES. IF YOU WEREN'T A GIRL, I'D GIVE YOU THE HIDING OF YOUR LIFE. ASHAMED OF YOURSELF? BUT I'D DO IT AGAIN. READY TO COME BACK? I'M NOT COMING BACK. I MADE UP ME MIND TO GO AFTER ME FATHER AND I'M GOING. NOT IN MY WAGON. I DON'T WANT YOUR WAGON ANYMORE. YOU CAN'T TAKE A WAGON OVER THE DESERT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TAKE ANY OXEN. WHY? BECAUSE THEY DRINK TOO MUCH. WHO TOLD YOU THAT? I DID, INKOOSI. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? [Kathy] I BROUGHT HIM. LOOK, KATHY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MAN'S BEEN TELLING YOU, BUT I GIVE YOU MY WORD NO ONE CAN CROSS THAT DESERT. HOW DOES THE INKOOSI KNOW? I'M GONNA TRY. I'M NOT AFRAID. THE INKOOSIKAS IS READY.

I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GO HUNTING. YOU KNOW, HUNTING, FISHING, ANYTHING WITH A LITTLE ADVENTURE IN IT. DO YOU KNOW HOW MEN DIE FOR LACK OF WATER? THIRST, BURNING THIRST THAT TURNS TO PAIN. TORTURE, THEN YOU GO MAD AND THE SUN KILLS YOU. IMAGINATIVE FELLOW, ISN'T HE? QUARTERMAIN. I'M SORRY OUR TRIP'S HAD TO END LIKE THIS. HOW DO YOU MEAN "END"? WE'LL BE AWAY FOR SOME TIME.

THEY MUST BE TO LIVE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS. WE CALL THEM "THE BIRD THAT SMELLS DEATH." HUH? OH. GOOD! COME HERE. O'BRIEN'S WAGON. GO BACK AND KEEP HER TALKING. FETCH THE OTHERS. [Henry] THAT'S THE LAST RATION OF WATER. HALF A BOTTLE EACH. THAT'S GOOD, I-- I SEE BY THE MAP THAT WE OUGHT TO GET TO PAN BAD WATER BY MIDDAY TOMORROW. WHY'S IT CALLED "PAN BAD WATER"? BECAUSE IN 300 YEARS IT MAY HAVE DRIED UP. OH... OH, I SEE, YES. GO ON, DRINK IT. WHAT'S THE USE, CURTIS? THERE'S NO POINT IN HER SURVIVING US. SAND! GO DOWN! RUN! [Wind whistling] [Wind howling] I SMELL WATER. I SMELL WATER. I SMELL WATER. [Speaking Kukuana] [Shouting] [Speaking Kukuana] LOOK! THE MOUNTAINS ARE NEAR! [Umbopa] CLIMBING UP CLIMBING UP TILL I'M HOLDING THE CLOUDS IN MY HAND CLIMBING UP CLIMBING UP TILL THE WORLD IS BELOW WHERE I STAND CLIMBING UP TO THE LAND THAT I KNOW MUST LIE OVER THAT MOUNTAIN CLIMBING UP CLIMBING UP FOR MY HEART IS AWAY IN THAT LAND MIGHTY MOUNTAIN [Echoing] MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OH YOU MOUNTAIN [Echoing] MOUNTAIN MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OH YOU MOUNTAIN GONNA CLIMB YOU [Echoing] CLIMB YOU GONNA CLIMB YOU [Echoing] GONNA CLIMB YOU MIGHTY MOUNTAIN [Echoing] MIGHTY MOUNTAIN CLIMBING UP CLIMBING UP TILL I'M HOLDING THE CLOUDS IN MY HAND CLIMBING UP CLIMBING UP TILL THE WORLD IS BELOW WHERE I STAND CLIMBING UP TO THE LAND THAT I KNOW MUST LIE OVER THAT MOUNTAIN CLIMBING UP CLIMBING UP FOR MY HEART IS AWAY IN THAT LAND MIGHTY MOUNTAIN [Echoing] MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OH YOU MOUNTAIN [Echoing] OH YOU MOUNTAIN MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OH YOU MOUNTAIN MIGHTY MOUNTAIN BREAKFAST READY? [Kathy] NEARLY. WE HAD MELONS FOR BREAKFAST YESTERDAY. WE DID. AND MELONS THE DAY BEFORE. WE DID. I SUPPOSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE MELONS TODAY? [Both] WE ARE. DON'T THE BIRDS IN THIS COUNTRY EVER LAY EGGS? I WONDER HOW FAR ME FATHER IS AHEAD OF US? YOU SURE HE GOT THIS FAR? OF COURSE I AM. PATRICK O'BRIEN HAS ALWAYS DONE WHAT HE SET HIS MIND TO. WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT IN THE DESERT? SAND, MOSTLY. DID YOU EVER THINK OF ME? YES... YOU AND THE SAND. I'M GLAD OF THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF ME IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. AM I? I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T AVOID IT. YOU SEE, WE'RE IN UNINHABITED COUNTRY. I HATE TO CONTRADICT YOU BUT, THERE'S A MAN BEHIND THAT ROCK-- SEVERAL MEN. THEY SEEM ANXIOUS TO MEET US. MUCH TOO ANXIOUS. [Shouting in Kukuana] WHAT'S HAPPENED? THEY SAY, "WHAT MANNER OF MAN IS THIS WITH THE BEAUTIFUL WHITE LEGS, "WHO GROWS HAIR ON ONE SIDE OF HIS FACE "AND CAN PLUCK HIS EYE FROM HIS HEAD AND REPLACE IT WHERE IT GROWS?" [Speaking Kukuana] HE'S TELLING THEM YOU ARE WHITE GODS FROM THE SKIES. YOU MEAN, ON ACCOUNT OF MY LEGS? I NEVER THOUGHT THEY WERE AS GOOD AS ALL THAT. [Speaking Kukuana] HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT BETTER IF HE'D BEEN AN IRISHMAN. [Drum beating] [Drums beating] [Chanting] [Speaking Kukuana] [Man shouting] [Chanting, drums beating] [Shouting in Kukuana] [Chanting and drumming] THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT FOR AN UNINHABITED COUNTRY. [Quartermain] THIS IS A MILITARY CROWD. I HOPE THE COOKING'S GOOD. THOSE ARE THE SOLDIERS' QUARTERS. THAT'S THE KING'S HUT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE AND WILLINGTON BARRACKS. SO UNLIKE THE HOME LIFE OF OUR DEAR QUEEN, ISN'T IT? SUPPOSE PATRICK O'BRIEN'S IN THERE? DON'T WORRY. ME FATHER'S GONE AFTER DIAMONDS. KING SOLOMON'S MINES, THAT'S WHERE WE'LL FIND HIM. IF THERE IS SUCH A MINE. [Speaking Kukuana] I SUPPOSE HE SAYS HE ISN'T IN. HE SAID, "THE TWALA, THE KING "WILL SEE THE STRANGERS WHO COME TO HIS LAND AND CLAIM TO BE GODS." [Cheering] I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THEIR SPEARS. IT'S ALL RIGHT. THEY THINK WE'RE GODS. I HOPE THE TWALA DOES. HEAD UP. IF HE THINKS WE'RE AFRAID ANYTHING MAY HAPPEN. [Speaking Kukuana] HA HA HA HA... [Shouting] WOULD IT DO ANY GOOD IF I WHIPPED OFF MY TROUSERS, DO YOU THINK? [Speaking Kukuana] HE ASKS,"WHY DO THE GODS HONOR HIS KINGDOM? "IS IT THE WHITE STONES THEY SEEK?" DIAMONDS! THERE IS A MINE. TELL HIM YES. [Speaking Kukuana] [Speaking Kukuana] HE'S GONNA TAKE US. KING SOLOMON'S MINES. THE GREATEST TREASURE IN THE WORLD. WITH ME FATHER INSIDE FILLING HIS POCKETS. [Shouting orders] [Crowd murmuring] IT SEEMS THEY ARE NICE FELLOWS AFTER ALL. I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH YOUR SHARE OF THE MONEY? IF WE GET OUT OF THIS, GO BACK TO ENGLAND AND KEEP SHEEP. I THINK I'LL BUY MYSELF A BATTLESHIP AND REJOIN THE NAVY. [Chanting] SCARED? OF COURSE I'M NOT. NOT VERY. KING SOLOMON'S ROAD AND THE SILENT ONES TO GUARD IT, BROKEN AND OVERGROWN. I WONDER HOW MANY CIVILIZATIONS HAVE PERISHED LIKE THIS ONE? SOLOMON HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IDOLS. THE PHOENICIANS DID. THEY WERE THE GREAT TRADERS OF SOLOMON'S TIME. PERHAPS SOME PHOENICIAN RAN THE MINE. GAGOOL, THE WITCH DOCTOR WHO LOOKS AFTER THE MINES. THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT SHE'S 100'S OF YEARS OLD. WOULD YOU SAY THAT SHE WAS WELL-PRESERVED? REMINDS ME OF MY POOR OLD AUNT HANNAH. SHE CAME TO NO GOOD. [Speaking Kukuana] SHE ASKS WHY THE WHITE MAN'S SERVANT WALKS LIKE A PRINCE? I'VE NOTICED IT MYSELF, AN UNCOMMONLY GOOD WALKER. ASK HER IF SHE'S SEEN A WHITE MAN. [Speaking Kukuana] [Speaking Kukuana] SHE HAS? PERHAPS IT WAS YESTERDAY, PERHAPS IT WAS 100 YEARS AGO. TIME HAS NO MEANING TO HER. [Rumbling] THROUGH THAT DOOR, SLAVES BROUGHT JEWELS FOR THE QUEEN OF SHEBA THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. AND PATRICK O'BRIEN WENT IN TO FIND HIS FORTUNE. COME ON. CAREFUL, INKOOSI. TWALA DARE NOT HARM YOU HERE. THE PEOPLE THINK YOU GODS. ONCE INSIDE, HE HAS NO ONE TO FEAR. THE STONE WILL ROLL BACK. [Shouting] COME AWAY. [Speaking Kukuana] [Shouting] [Rumbling] GET OUT OF HERE! GIVE ME THAT! [Shouts] KILL HIM, YOU'LL HAVE THE LOT ON US. THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A GUN FIRED BEFORE. [Crowd screaming] I BET THAT MADE HIM FEEL PRETTY SILLY. [Drums beating] [Chanting] OUR ONE CHANCE IS TO ESCAPE BEFORE THEY MAKE UP THEIR MINDS. I'M AFRAID IT IS. SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE GUARD. PITY, SEEMED A VERY DECENT FELLOW. ALL RIGHT, BUT I'M STOPPING HERE. KATHY, BE SENSIBLE. YOU CAN'T. I CAME HERE TO FIND ME FATHER. THERE ISN'T A VESTIGE OF PROOF THAT YOUR FATHER EVER REACHED HERE. HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY. ME SHAMROCK! BUT I--IT'S NOT-- IT IS HIS! ME FATHER'S! SO HE IS HERE. NOW DO YOU WAN ME TO RUN AWAY? WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS? ON THE WAY TO THE MINE. KATHY, YOU SAW WHAT NEARLY HAPPENED TO US. THIS PROVES THAT IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO YOUR FATHER. IF YOUR FATHER LOVED YOU AS MUCH AS YOU LOVE HIM, HE'D BE THE LAST ONE TO WANT YOU TO STAY. WOULDN'T HE? THAT'S NOT FAIR. I'M SORRY, KATHY. AGREED, WE LEAVE TONIGHT? YES. IT IS NOT AGREED. YOU MUST STAY. I'M IN CHARGE HERE. I TOLD YOU THAT BEFORE. THAT WAS IN YOUR COUNTRY. WE ARE NOW IN MINE. YOU CANNOT ESCAPE. EVERYWHERE, THE MEN OF TWALA WATCH. ONE STEP BEYOND THAT DOOR AND A SPEAR WILL PIERCE YOUR BACK. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? TOMORROW THE DRUMS BEAT, THEY SMELL OUT THE EVILDOERS. GAGOOL WILL PUT HER MARK ON THE ENEMIES OF THE KING. THEY DIE LIKE CATTLE. LOOKS LIKE A RED- LETTER DAY FOR ALL OF US, DOESN'T IT? YET THE PEOPLE ARE WEARY OF WICKEDNESS AND BLOOD. IF THERE WAS ONE TO LEAD THEM, THEY WOULD RISE UP. ISN'T THERE ONE? PERHAPS HE COULD BE FOUND. WHO ARE YOU? THE MAN WHO LOOKS FOR DIAMONDS AND HANGS ABOUT YOUR CAMP. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID. ONCE THERE WAS A KING IN THIS LAND, IMOTU THE LOVED, BUT HE FOUGHT THE WICKED GAGOOL, WHO IS OLDER THAN THE MEMORY OF THE OLDEST MAN. FOR THAT, SHE MADE HIS BROTHER TWALA THE ONE-EYED KILL HIM WHILE HE SLEPT. THE WIFE OF IMOTU AND THE SON OF IMOTU WERE DRIVEN INTO THE DESERT. IT IS SAID THEY DIED. IF THEY DIDN'T, THE SON OF IMOTU SHOULD BE KING AND NOT TWALA. YOU ARE THE SON OF IMOTU. I AM THE SON OF IMOTU. [Drums beating] [Whispering in Kukuana] [Drums beating, chanting] [Umbopa speaking Kukuana] THE COMMITTEE SEEMS UNANIMOUS. I ALWAYS THOUGH THAT FELLOW HAD A SPOT OF ROYAL BLOOD IN HIM. YOU DON'T GET A SNAKE ON YOUR STOMACH FOR NOTHING, YOU KNOW. IT IS AGREED. TOMORROW AT THE SMELLING-OUT OF THE EVILDOERS, THEY WILL LEAD THE PEOPLE OF THE KUKUANA AGAINST TWALA, BUT I NEED YOUR HELP. AND IN RETURN I OFFER YOU YOUR LIVES AND THE FREEDOM OF THE MINES. FOR YOU, THE DIAMONDS, RICHES. FOR YOU, ADVENTURE. FOR YOU, THE HAPPINESS OF THE INKOOSIKAS. TODAY, YOU SAW HOW TWALA TREATS STRANGERS. IF YOUR FATHER IS ALIVE, HE IS IN THE MINE. HOW CAN WE HELP YOU? BEHIND TWALA STANDS GAGOOL. THE PEOPLE FEAR HER MAGIC. THEY WILL RISE ONLY IF YOU SHOW THEM A GREATER MAGIC. YOU LIVE AMONG US. YOU KNOW THAT THE WHITE MAN HAS NO MAGIC. I MUST HAVE MAGIC. AND IF WE CANNOT GIVE IT? THE DRUMS WILL ROLL AT THE SMELLING-OUT. GAGOOL WILL GIVE THE SIGN. THE KILLERS WILL SPEED TO THE EVILDOERS. THEY WILL BEAT US TO DEATH. [Chanting, drums beating] FUNNY TO THINK IT'S DERBY DAY BACK HOME. VERY FUNNY. I HAD A BET ON MANITOBA. THERE'S NO SUCH HORSE. THERE CERTAINLY IS. I'VE GOT IT IN MY DIARY. [Chanting] HERE IT IS, DERBY DAY, MANI-- BY JOVE! LOOK HERE! "11:15. TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN VISIBLE OVER TENERIFFE, SOUTH AFRICA." MAGIC! GOOD, YOU'RE A GENIUS. 11:15. THAT OUGHT TO SETTLE 'EM, EH? IT'S A CHANCE. IF WE CAN HOLD OUT TILL 11:15. ARE YOU SURE IT'S THIS YEAR'S DERBY? OF COURSE, I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A BET ON LAST YEAR'S DERBY THIS YEAR, WOULD I? NO. [Shouts] [Drumming stops] [Shouts] [Crowd repeating chants in Kukuana] [Rhythmic chanting] [Crowd] OOOOHH! [Drums beating] [Drums beating faster] [Man screams] WHAT TIME IS IT? 11:10. [Drums beating] [Drums beating faster] HOW LONG BEFORE THEY GET TO US? A MATTER OF MINUTES. [Drums beating faster] [Man screams] NO SIGN OF THE ECLIPSE YET. WE'RE NEXT. I HOPE I'M RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME. GOD HELP US IF YOU'RE NOT. [Drums beating faster] [Drums beating faster] [Speaking Kukuana] [Shouts] [Crowd chanting] [Speaking Kukuana] [Crowd screaming] KUKUANA KUKUANA KUKUANA KUKUANA KUKUANA KUKUANA [Clapping and song continuing in Kukuana] KUKUANA KUKUANA [Rhythmic drumming and clapping] KUKUANA KUKUANA KUKUANA KUKUANA [Singing in Kukuana] KUKUANA [Crowd] KUKUANA [Drumming] KUKUANA [Drumming] [Shouting] [Drums beating] [Shouting] [Chanting] [Drum beating] [Shouts in the distance] [Shouting crowd approaches] [Umbopa] WA! [Shouting] [Umbopa yelling] [Shouting] LAST TIME I FIRED THIS THING, IT DIDN'T FIRE. [Gun clicking] IT STILL DOESN'T. [Shouting stops] [Mumbling] [Speaking Kukuana] [Shouting] [Shouts] [Chanting] [Shouting] [Chanting] [Shouting] [Shouting] [Screaming] [Silence] [Shouting in Kukuana] [Crowd repeating chant] KATHY? KATHY! SHE'S GONE. LOOK! GAGOOL, THE MINE! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! FATHER! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? INDEED, I'M NOT ALL RIGHT, NOT AFTER BREAKING ME LEG. [Rumbling] KATHY! KATHY! KATHY! COME ON! OF COURSE YOU WOULD BREAK YOUR LEG IN A PLACE LIKE THIS. HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO CARRY YOU? YOU OLD DEVIL. KATHY! KATHY! COME ON, YOU CAN GET THOSE LATER! KATHY! [Gurgling] [Hissing] DIDN'T I TELL YOU HE'D GET HERE? THANK GOD YOU'RE SAFE. OF COURSE I'M SAFE. SO THIS IS WHAT PUT AN END TO THE MINES. THEY STUMBLED UPON A VOLCANO. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THOSE SKELETONS? MINERS TRYING TO ESCAPE AND TRAPPED BY THE LAVA. OH... HURRY UP, CURTIS, WILL YOU? [Speaking Kukuana] [Screams] THIS IS GOING, TOO! COME ON! TOO BAD THAT WHEN WE GET TO A FORTUNE IN DIAMONDS, THE MOUNTAIN SHOULD DECIDE TO SIT DOWN ON IT. IT DID NOT, THEN. I'VE A FORTUNE HERE IN ME POCKET. THERE'S ENOUGH HERE FOR ALL OF US. DIAMONDS ARE NOT MUCH USE WHEN YOU'RE TRAPPED BEHIND SOLID ROCK. I DON'T WANT TO DEPRESS YOU ANY FURTHER, BUT I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ERUPTION. THAT FALL OF ROCK, YOU KNOW? VOLCANOES ARE NERVOUS THINGS, IT TAKES VERY LITTLE TO UPSET THEM. [Explosions] IF IT WASN'T FOR ME, YOU'D BE QUIETLY SHOOTING GAME IN THE SOUTH. AND THEN YOU'D HAVE GONE HOME AND MARRIED SOME NICE GIRL AND LIVED IN YOUR BIG HOUSE. AND SLOWLY GROWN OLD AND FAT AND DISAGREEABLE, AND ENDED UP A FEEBLE OLD MAN WITH NO ONE SORRY TO SEE YOU GO. NO, I'D RATHER DIE YOUNG. STRANGE, I USED TO HATE DYING. I'D LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT THINKING ABOUT IT, SCARED. BUT WHEN YOU COME TO IT, IT'S NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL. [Rumbling] [Explosions] THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I'M SORRY ABOUT. I'D LIKE TO HAVE SEEN IRELAND AGAIN, THE GLEN OF ARMAGH WHERE I WAS BORN, WITH THE MOUNTAINS RUNNING DOWN TO THE LAKES. WE WERE TO HAVE GONE HOME NEXT YEAR. YOU COULD HAVE COME WITH US. [Umbopa] QUARTERMAIN! [Echoing] QUARTERMAIN! [Echoing] QUARTERMAIN! LOOK! IT'S MOVING! GOOD IDEA BUT-- IT--IT'S BOUND TO FALL ON US. UMBOPA? [Umbopa] CURTIS, WE MUST PUSH IT CLEAR. READY? RIGHT. [Umbopa] READY? THIS TIME. IT'S GONNA ERUPT! STEADY. GOT HIM? [Rumbling] COME ON! HERE MY COUNTRY ENDS, BUT 100 OF MY MEN WILL LEAD YOU ACROSS THE DESERT. GO NOW, MY FRIENDS, AND AT TIMES, REMEMBER HOW WE STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN THE GREAT BATTLE. CLIMBING UP CLIMBING UP TILL I'M HOLDING THE CLOUDS IN MY HANDS CLIMBING UP CLIMBING UP TILL THE WORLD IS BELOW WHERE I STAND CLIMBING UP TO THE LAND THAT I KNOW MUST LIE OVER THAT MOUNTAIN CLIMBING UP CLIMBING UP FOR MY HEART IS AWAY IN THAT LAND MIGHTY MOUNTAIN MIGHTY MOUNTAIN MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OH YOU MOUNTAIN MIGHTY MOUNTAIN
