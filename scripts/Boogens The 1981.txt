Hey, are you done some more damage? Truck, some of mine? Do not look like that. This is another strange thing. We have a lot of radio in the truck, mostly on the go, but they did not not even touched. Well, someone should keep an eye on the generator, to avoid problems later. It costs 5-600 dollars. Or 1,000. Yes. Well, as we said they were vandals, that's all. Pretty weird by vandals. Damn weird from vandals. Remind me not to budge. Are you finished with the bathroom? - Yes.

Svratiu to the grocery store as soon as I ended up in the office. I really want to write about the mine? At least I will have a press kit. If you forget something, call me. OK. Hey, thanks for the bathroom. Bye-bye. - Hi. I worked at the Post. Seriously? Yes, in 1953. year. In 1953. and 1954's. Really? The extension. I was the first raznosaica newspaper. You know I could write about this topic: First raznosaica newspaper in Denver. Yes, this sounds fascinating. It'll definitely remember. It was a summer in 1953. A Articles Resources on mine? O, that erosion. How's it going, guys? - Great. What are you doing? - I want to take some samples. Before you come from a surveillance... I'll send some samples to Denver for analysis. I want to ask you something about these bones. Yes, what about them? If these died from gas or because of lack of air, or from hunger... Their skeletons should be separated, rather than a pile of bones. Yes, you're right, this is really weird. OK, we're done with this. Roger would ever need to return. I want to call the office and ask when he was there. We need the maps should work in these tunnels afternoon. I am sure that there are no problems , otherwise the call. Well, you certainly find out! OK. Come on. Come on, do not give me a hard job. Now this is more like it already. They wrote a lot of stories about these collapses. What is this? Lieutenant in the U.S. Army limo was sent from Denver spasilaku to lead the operation. But by the time he arrived on Tuesday, anyway... Rescue camp was abandoned... This is weird... Do not write why they broke up with a rescue. Why did I tell you that in this day and age write worse. This should see. Listen to this. Suspect that it was done by a miner named Harold Griswold, who caused the tragedy. Griswold was the only man who survived the collapse of , But was not able to testify in court on accident in a mine... Remanded to hospital for mental health problems . Why would a man mad? Hello? Yes. It's for you. A girl by the name of Jessica. Thank you. Hi! - Hi! You look like a real miner. What's going on, huh? So, what's up? I do not know. Roger had problems with the car or something? Why? Well, I've spoken to Jess, she looked garage and pick there. Brian's pick? Yes, I do. Roger's with the should go to Denver. Came back? It's already to come back now. I do not know. I mean, I, we have not heard about it. I'm talking now with the Denver office, but Roger has not appeared there. Do you think he had the accident on the road? - On With what? The car in front of his house. Might be stopped. Roger did not want to go so in Denver. This is really weird. Yes. Do you want to hear something else weird? Well, I was in the office of the press by some articles of the collapse. I one of the miners actually pulled, and said that they were attacked. Attacked? Yes. Supposed to testify here in Denver but totally freaked out, went crazy, after he was transferred to a mental hospital. This does not seem to have much sense. - A lot of things now, so it seems. Listen, I want to now go back to the Jessica, right? 'll Talk with Brian, I'll see if he can let me go early. Okay, great. I have to stop and pick up some groceries. What do I say? Tell her I'll find out what's going on, and tell her not to worry. OK. And do not you worry. See you soon. Hey! Where are the rest of the bags? Need for samples. Got there a couple. OK. Pogledau. Oh, shut up. Tigre? Tigre? What hell are you doing? - Any of something in the water. Come on, you're imagining things. Not imagining anything. Something floating there. You reach? Yet. What the hell? - I do not know, but it's stuck. God! This is Roger! My God. Jesus Christ, look at his face. Well, get it. This is the young man who work for you, right? Who's there? You could not leave them alone , is not it? You had to set them free. Who are you to hell? I warned you. Warned? Damn. You've set the damn cross? Now we have to close them again, is not it? What are you, the hell you talking about? You let them come out. And now we have to close it again. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, Mark! Your friend... is dead. Jesus. But Roger was at home. The mine was closed. How is it possible... These tunnels water everywhere under the city. They are associated with the home. Your explosion freed them. Popee through tunnels and uhvatie them. Through the tunnels? Tunnel to the house. Girls! Go get them! You go get them! Come on, for God's sake, go get them. I bring some help, hurry up! They are... They closed my father... An asylum, after the great collapse. No one did not believe him. I would check out the tunnels over the years. To make sure they are well sealed . I checked and tunnels at home, too. Yes, I'm sure this can be solved somehow . That was my job. Well, you see, we we want to help you . Do not you, Dan? - Yes. You see, we we want to help you in your job , if only... No! No! You opened the tunnels, you let them come out. You have not listened to my warnings, I I have to close them again explosion. Den! Den! Monsters! My God, is returning to! Back! We have to stop him! For Christ's sake, answer the damn phone ! Yes, operator, give me sheriff's office. It's an emergency. Jessica! Jess? Jessica? Jessica? Jessica! O God! God! Jessica! Jesus! Jessica ! Trish! That's it! That's it! Take it easy! 'll Be all right. It's... Jessica's dead. What? Jesus. What is this hell? Whatever it is, it's probably attacked Roger at the mine. Roger? Roger is dead. O God, what is happening... This is najudnija damn thing I've ever seen. Mark! No, Jessica... For it already is nothing we can do! Good, could explode at any moment. No, no. Do not worry, come on. Do you know where we are? - Yes, this is connects to the main tunnel. OK. Just be careful. Mark! Come on! Get out of here! Brian, slowly, slowly. It'll be all right. There's more. Okay, okay, we're almost out . - There's more. We need to blow up and shut this damn place. What I'm saying? Dan is dead, and the old man. Izveu you out. We'll all get out! Dynamite, take the dynamite. There is back. We have to close this damn mine. Come on! Stay close to us, in case. Just in case. Hurry! Hurry! No, no, no. It's okay. Done. We stopped them. Come on.
