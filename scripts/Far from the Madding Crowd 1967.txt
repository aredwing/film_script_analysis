Come here, come here! Come here. Bad dog. Sit down, down. You mad dog. No. Come here. Now, get away out. Get away out back. Get away out round him. Mr. Oak! Sweet. Bathsheba. She was here. I brought her a lamb. I thought she might like to rear it. She might. Bathsheba. She should be here. Would you care to wait? Thank you. If you'd like to leave the lamb, I'll tell her. Well, the lamb isn't really the business I came about, Mrs. Hurst. In short, I was going to ask her if she'd like to be married. Were you, indeed? Because if she would, I'd be very glad to marry her. Do you know if she has any other men hanging about her at all? Dozens, I'm afraid. One, two, three, dozens. Oh, that's unfortunate. I'm only an everyday sort of man... ...and my only chance was in being first comer. No use of my waiting, then. Well, I'll take myself off. Gabriel! Gabriel. It's not true. - What isn't? - Dozens. - Oh. - Not one nor two nor three. - I see. - In fact, I haven't anyone at all. Well, I'm really and truly very glad to hear that. I've got a snug little farm. Yes, yes, you have. A man's advanced me money to begin, but I shall pay that off... ...soon as my sheep come to market. - Mm. I'm only an everyday sort of man, but, uh... Well, I've got on a little since I was a boy. And when we're married, I shall work twice as hard as I do now. I know I can make you happy. You shall have a piano in a year or two. Farmers' wives are getting to have pianos now. Oh, I should like that. And I could practice up a flute. Play for you in the evenings. You shall have one of those 10-pound gigs for market. - Really? - And a frame for cucumbers. We'll have the wedding put in the papers. - Oh, I should love that. - And the babies in the list of births. And at home by the fire, whenever I look up, there you will be. And whenever you look up, there I shall be. I'm sorry, but it's no use. Why? Because I don't love you. Now, that is a tale. You chase after a man, then you say you don't want him. I didn't chase after you. I just didn't want you thinking I was any man's property. Look, Mr. Oak. You're a farmer, just beginning. And in common prudence, you ought to marry a woman with money... ...who can clear you of debt and stock up a good farm for you. That's the very thing I've been thinking myself. Then why'd you come here bothering me? Perhaps because I can't bring myself to be prudent. Oh, I see. And how could you possibly expect me to marry someone who can't be prudent? No, Bathsheba. I'll wait a while. I love you far more than common. I'm sorry, but I don't love you a bit. So it'd be ridiculous, wouldn't it? Very well. Then I shall ask you no more. - Bye-bye, auntie. Goodbye, sweetheart. - Take care of yourself. - I will. Get a message to me. - I will. Take care of her, Mr. Gibbons. - Take care of yourself too. Don't forget to write to me! Boxey! Boxey! Come back! Thank God I'm not married. Form ranks there. Come on. Get into line. Frank. Frank. Fanny. Come on. Come on. What are you doing here? - I can't stop now. - But you did say that we could... That I could come and see you. You shouldn't be here. Frank? - When will it be? - When will what be? The ceremony. The ceremony? The wedding. You did say time and again we'd be married. If I said so, then we will. Only, I can't stop now. You did mean it, didn't you, Frank? Fanny. Do I love you? Oh, Frank. Well, do I? You will get permission from the officers, won't you? I'll get more than permission, unless I get on. I'll lose my stripes. And you'll lose your week's wages if you don't get back. As soon as we get our posting, I'll send you word. - I'll come right away. You'll come when I tell you. And not a minute later. Now, don't be a doodle, Fanny. I'll see you soon. That's enough of that. Forward, march. Where would you like to go now, then? You looking for a hand, sir? No. I'm looking for a place myself. - Do you anyone who needs a bailiff? - Oh, that I don't. - How long have you been a shepherd? - A year, sir. What work are you after? - Bailiff, sir. - I'm wanting a shepherd. And how long have you been with him? Yes? What about old Samway? There was no one better in his day... ...and there's work in him yet. Not enough for my acreage. You get him cheap. You eat well? Are you wanting a shepherd? - No, a bailiff. Seven shillings. - I've got three children, I can't... - Seven shillings a week and a cottage. - I don't know, sir. I was hoping 8. - It's a good cottage. Take it, Tom. - I was hoping 8, sir. - No. All right, sir, all right. Whose farm were you last upon? My own, sir. Good night, Mr. Boldwood. I'll race you home sometime. Her's a handsome body of a woman, the new mistress. As far as looks are concerned, that is. So her do seem. So her do seem. Hey, boy, steady. They say, sir... ...every night afore her goes to bed, her sits in front of the mirror... ...to see her nightcap's on proper. There's a vain female. And not a married woman. Of all the world. It were a funny thing to do, leave a farm to a woman. I never thought old Mr. Everdene would ever leave a farm to a woman. His nearest relation, she is. Ah. Looks in the glass to put on her nightcap properly. Ha, ha. Very vain female. Help, everyone! - Gonna catch, they'll all go up! Help. Help! That were a funny thing to do... ...leave a farm to a woman. Looks in her glass to put on her nightcap properly. That's a vain female. Her's a vain female, for sure. Hurry up, hurry up. Keep back, you lot there. It's hopeless. The whole yard will go up. Where's the bailiff? Where's Bailiff Pennyways? Where's Bailiff Pennyways? - Nobody's ever seen him, it's hopeless. - Where's Bailiff Pennyways? - I don't know, ma'am. - I don't know where he is in all this mess. Where's Bailiff Pennyways? He must be somewhere. Just go and find him. Go and find the bailiff. Leave the rick alone. It's gone. It's hopeless, sir. It's hopeless. No, it's not. Get rick tops. Rick tops. Rick tops. You, get water. Bring those underneath, stop the draft underneath it. Rick tops? Rick tops. You, get water. Water. Bring the water over here! This way. Soak these ricks up. Make a line. Make a line. Make a line. Here. Full buckets coming up. The empty ones going down. Keep this line going. Who's that giving orders? Bring the water over here. Faster down there. - Pass them down quicker. Buckets. Buckets. There goes the other rick. - Get the ladder. The ladder. Fetch your dad's claw. - Who is that man taking charge? - I don't know. But whoever he is, he saved your ricks for you. Where's Bailiff Pennyways? Let's go. Put it in the bottom there. Down that way. Pour it on there. You want a shepherd, ma'am? Who's that? What are you doing here, Mr. Pennyways? It's you, Miss Everdene. L... You startled me. I was shifting some barley... ...because of the fire. - Don't you lie to me like that. Leave that and get out. - Don't get the wrong idea, Miss Everdene. - I haven't. Last count there were five sacks missing. - Now I know why. - Now, look... I want you off this farm before sunrise. Otherwise, I'll have you thrown off. Do you understand? Give me the keys. Laid at him like a tomcat, I heard. Did she? Wondering who's gonna be baily now. Question is, who's gonna be baily now? What kind of a place is this to live at? What kind of a missus is she to work under? Her hasn't had the farm above a couple of weeks. Her uncle was took bad, doctor was sent for. But with all his worldwide skill, he couldn't save the man. Yes, yes, yes. Good morning, miss. Good morning. Before I begin, you ought to know that the bailiff has been dismissed for thieving. - Pennyways? And I resolve to have no bailiff at all. I shall manage everything with my own head and hands. So from now on, these keys remain where I can find them. Now, there's 10 shillings on his pay, for anyone who wants to stay. And no hard words for anyone who wants to go. What do you say? I'll stay, miss. And I'll stay too, ma'am. Henery Fray. What's your name? Me? Cainy Ball. Cain? How did you come by such a name? It were like this, ma'am. My mother, her not being a scripture-read woman... ...uh, made a mistake at my christening. Her thought that Abel killed Cain. And her called me Cain... ...mistaking Abel for Cain. How unfortunate for you. Thank you. We call him Cainy because it sounds better. Oh. Um, Andrew Randle. Will you stay? Well, I... He can curse as well as you or I. But he can't say a common speech to save him. If you're staying, Andrew, just nod your head. Oh. Finish thanking me in a day or two. Laban Tall, will you stay with us? For you, or anyone else who pays me well. A man must live. Who's that woman? - I be his lawful wife. Oh, you are? - Well, will you stay, Laban? - He'll stay, ma'am. - I suppose he can speak for himself. - Oh, Lord, ma'am, not he. Poor gawk-hammer mortal. Thank you, ma'am. Fanny Robin. Born on the farm. Brought up by your uncle, one of the family. Oh, I hope you'll remain so. Two shillings and sixpence. Thank you, ma'am. Temperance and Soberness Miller. Both women, I suppose. - Here we be. - Here we be, ma'am. What do you do? - Tend the threshing machine... ...wimble haybonds, ma'am... ...and say whoosh to the cocks when they go upon the seeds. And plant Early Flourballs and Thompson's Wonderfuls with a dibble. Are they satisfactory women? Yielding women, ma'am. As scarlet a pair as ever you saw. Sit down. Who, ma'am? - Sit down. Temperance and Soberness, live up to your names. - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am. Joseph Poorgrass, I'll stay, sir. Ma'am, I meant. Thank you. This is the new shepherd, miss. Oh, yes. You understand your duties? Quite well, thank you, Miss Everdene. And if I'm in any doubt, I'll inquire. Thank you. You know... ...I don't yet know my powers... ...or my talents in farming... ...but I shall do my best. And if you serve me well, so shall I serve you. Don't let anyone suppose that because I'm a woman... ...I don't understand the difference between bad goings-on and good. I shall be up before you're awake. I shall be afield before you are up... ...and I shall have breakfasted before you're afield. In short, I shall astonish you all. What a mess. Oh, I don't know what he wanted all these old papers for. Don't you feel that way? Oh, excellent, you are so strong. - All right with it. Mm. - Are you sure? Yes. - I wonder if I shall be able to keep it up. - Oh, yes, of course you will. Yes, I will. Look what I found, miss. A valentine. Be a pity not to send it, seeing it's the season. Oh, yes, so it is. Isn't that lovely? I'll send it to one of the Coggan boys. They'd love it. - Yes. - Oh, that's lovely. Thank you, Maryann. He's ridden right up to the front door. Impertinence! I'm not seeing anyone who behaves like that. And I don't care who it is. Who is it? It's Mr. Boldwood. He's got the farm opposite. I wonder what he wants. Why doesn't someone answer the door? He'll ride away. You're gonna see him, then? - Why, no. Of course not. I don't want him to go without knowing I'm not gonna see him. Oh, Maryann, you go. I can't go like this, miss. He'll ride away. Fanny! Where is the girl? Oh, Mr. Boldwood. Is Miss Everdene in, Mrs. Coggan? I'll see, sir. No. I'm sorry, sir. Miss is dusting bottles and it's quite an object. I beg you to excuse her. I was just wondering if she wanted any advice, what with the fire and so on. - Tell her I'll be too happy to be of service. - I'll tell her, sir. I'm sure she'll be grateful. - Morning, Mr. Boldwood. - Morning, Fray. Tell your mistress if she needs any help, not to be too proud to ask. I will that, sir. We're like England herself now, with a queen at the helm. Indeed. I wish you joy of that. Mr. Boldwood. Is there a Mrs. Boldwood? No. Never was there such a hopeless man for a woman. He's been courted by sixes and sevens. All the girls, gentle and simple, for miles around have tried him. Janey Perkins worked him for two months, like a slave. He cost Farmer Ives' daughters nights of tears and 20 pounds in new clothes. Oh, he's married to his farm. That's the truth of it. There's no woman can touch him, miss. 'Tis said he has no passionate parts. Did anybody ever want to marry you, miss? Oh, lots of them, I dare say. A man wanted to, once. - How nice it must seem. - Ha, ha. And you wouldn't have him? He wasn't good enough for me. - Did you love him, miss? - Oh, no, but I did rather like him. Come along. It'll do the work of 10 men, and do it better. So don't let's have any shaking of heads. Come along. I want one man on the bags and two at the back... ...to clear the straw. Come on, it won't attack you. Come along. Two at the back. The rose is red The violet blue Carnation's sweet And so are you Do you know what I'd like to do? - What? - Send this to Mr. Boldwood. Well, he'll not be amused, miss. Do you think I shouldn't? Oh, yeah, go on. Go on. Yes, I'm going to. Where's some ink? I saw some... Oh, there it is. - Tomorrow at 11:00. - Yes. At All Saints. And, um... - Don't you be late. - Oh, Frank. Tuba. Eyes on me. Tuba. Tuba. Eyes on the leader. She will have to be here in the next quarter of an hour, you know. - Is this the All Saints Church? - This is the Garrison Church of All Souls. Oh, Frank. Oh, Frank. Thank heavens. Oh, I made a terrible mistake. Can you believe it? I thought the Garrison Church was All Saints. And then I realized. But it's all right, isn't it, Frank? I mean, it can always be tomorrow, can't it? You fool, for so fooling me. Oh, Frank, I am sorry. - But it can be tomorrow, can't it? - Can it? You made a fool out of me. - Well, when will it be, Frank? - I don't know. I don't know. I said I was sorry! Why, I wouldn't give you 45 shillings a quart for it. - Forty-five shillings a quart? - No, not 45 shillings. Good morning, miss. Good morning. I wonder if you could help me. Where would I get the best corn seed? You've come to the right place. That's old Everdene's niece. - Who? - Old Everdene's niece. Sam here has the finest in the county. Trouble is, it's gone the moment he sets his foot in the exchange. 'Tis true. 'Tis true. I haven't got a sack left. Still, I dare say, you could thresh an extra sack or two? Well, I dare say, I might, possibly. But, mark you, 60 shillings a sack is what I've been offered. Sixty shillings? You'll not find better than that, miss, wherever you go. Here, have a look on it. There's no nose to it. You won't find better grain than that in the market. Well, now, I know nothing about these matters, it's obvious. Oh, you can trust Sam, miss. Or I'd say that this was... ...a fusty, pinched, no-good parcel of pig fodder. Stay. Hurry. Come on. Get them up there, now. Gabriel. Good morning. Well, miss? - I've been checking the records. We've never had so many lambs come to maturity as this year. Not ever. Well, we've been lucky, miss. I've been lucky. Morning. Morning, Mr. Boldwood. - Good morning, Miss Everdene. - Mr. Boldwood. Good morning. I have come, hoping that I might speak to you. Yes. Yes, of course. L... I feel almost too much to think. But I've come to talk to you without preface. My life has not been my own since I've beheld you clearly. Miss Everdene, I've come to make you my offer of marriage. Beyond everything, everything I ever believed... ...I want you as my wife. It will be a good thing to put the whole valley under one master. What's her got to get married for? Her's strong enough to fight her battles. Well, he's a fine man. She'd be lucky to have him. Shouldn't I like to kiss her. Oh. Smack her on her cherry-red lips. I should say so. Ha, ha. That ought to cool you off. That's enough of that smack-and-coddle style of yours, Mark Clark. Do you understand? I would never have spoken out... ...had I not been led to hope. Oh, that foolish valentine. Foolish? That foolish, wanton valentine. If you can only forgive me for my thoughtlessness. No, don't say thoughtlessness. Make me believe it was something more, a sort of prophetic instinct. The beginning of a feeling that you would like me. You shall have everything you want. No worries. No household cares. No thought of weather in the harvest. I wish I could put my feelings into more graceful shape. Miss Everdene, if you could... I do not love you, Mr. Boldwood. Certainly, I must say that. Say, at least, that you do not refuse me absolutely. God only knows how much you mean to me. I don't know what to say. - Then say nothing... - I must say... ...and let me speak to you again upon the matter. I'm afraid they will notice us. - May I call on you tomorrow? - Oh, no, please. No, please. You must give me time. Any time. I'm happier now. Oh, no. I beg you, really, you mustn't think... No, no, no. I must think. Yes. And I will wait. Gabriel. Are you there? Gabriel. Is that you? Yes, miss. Did you not hear me calling? No, miss. I wondered whether everything was ready for the shearing. Oh, yes, indeed, miss. You needn't worry on that score. Tell me, Gabriel, did the men make any observation... ...on my going off with Mr. Boldwood? Yes, they did. Did they think it odd? No, miss, not odd. Well, what did they say? That Boldwood's name and your own... ...were likely to be flung over pulpit together. Oh, that's absolute nonsense. There's not a word of truth in it. And I want you to tell them so, Gabriel. Well, now, Bathsheba... Miss Everdene, you mean. I mean this, Miss Everdene, I mean this. If Mr. Boldwood really spoke to you of marriage... ...I am not gonna put it about that he didn't just to please you. I already tried to please you too much for my own good. I only want you to tell them that I'm not going to marry him. Not that there'd be any shame in it if I were. However, I'm not, and I'd be glad if you told them so. I can say that to them, if you wish, Miss Everdene. Likewise, I could give an opinion to you on what you've done. I dare say you can. But I don't want your opinion. Well, what is your opinion? That it's unworthy. I'm sorry if that sounds like a reprimand. Oh, no, not at all. As far as I'm concerned, a reprimand from you... ...is the same as a compliment from anyone of real judgment. And where in particular lies my unworthiness? In not marrying you, perhaps? I long ceased thinking about that. Or wishing it, I suppose? Or wishing it, either. My opinion is... ...that you are blame for playing pranks on a man like Mr. Boldwood. Leading a man on you don't care for, for the fun of it. Just to satisfy your own vanity. How dare you criticize my personal conduct. - You invited it. - I will not allow any man to criticize me. I won't have you a moment longer. Very well. In that case, I shall be glad to go. Go then, in heaven's name. Very good, Miss Everdene. Can't you do anything? There's only one man in the county that knows the trick. Well, get him. Go on, hurry. Shepherd Oak, missus. I won't have him on this farm. How about Farmer Boldwood? He'll know. He haven't got the touch, saving your presence, not with animals. They'll all be as dead as nits if they bain't be gut out and cured. I won't have him on this farm. I won't. I won't, I won't, I won't. She says you must come at once, Gabriel. Must? You go tell your mistress for me that beggars can't be... "...choosers," he says. And you must ask him civil. As becomes any human being... ...begging a favor from another. I won't. Go. Yip. Yip. Go. - Hey. - Hey, hey. Get on. Get up. Get up. Get on. Hey. Ho, ho. Hey. - Hey, get on. - Get on. - Get up. Here. Here we go. Get on now. Hey. Here. Get on. - Gabriel? - Get on. Get on. Ho. Gabriel? Would you stay on with us, please? I will. Now, Master Poorgrass, what about your song? - Mine, ma'am? - Yes. I be all but in liquor and the gift is wanting in me. Don't be ungrateful, Joseph. Mistress is looking hard at you. - Come on. Come on, now. Come on. Yeah, come on. "Seeds of Love." - "Seeds of Love." - "Seeds of Love." Hush-a-bye. Hush-a-bye. Good evening, sir. Mr. Boldwood, how nice to see you. Good evening, Miss Everdene. Evening, sir. Evening, Mr. Boldwood. Evening. Gabriel, would you...? Will you sit down, Mr. Boldwood? - Thank you, Oak. - All right. Bunch up, lads. Come on. Give the man room. - Will you sing us a song, mistress? - Liddy. - Oh, yeah. Mistress, sing us a song. - Go on, then. Gabriel. Yes? - Do you have your flute? You'll need it. Pass up the flute. - Will you play if I sing? - Well, what shall it be, miss? "Bushes and Briars." - "Bushes and Briars." - "Bushes and Briars." Now, let's have a bit of quiet for the mistress. - Thank you. - Very good. - Thank you, mistress. - That's great. - Bravo. - Well done. - Good night. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Good night. Let's get ready. Come on. Get up. Come on. Come on, give her a shot. If I can believe... ...in any way that I could make you a good wife... ...I will indeed be willing to marry you. - Miss Everdene. - But I cannot promise yet. And I have not promised tonight. You shall not regret it. If it's in my power, you shall not regret it. When can I hope to hear? Why, I shall not keep you in suspense a moment longer than I need. Please, don't decide hastily. No, no, I won't. Perhaps... Perhaps... ...by harvest time? By harvest time. By harvest time I shall know. Yes, you shall have your answer. But please remember, I have not promised yet. Good night, mate. - Aah! Good night. Let me go. I haven't got you. - Is it a woman? - You have. And it is. A lady, I should've said. If you'll just give me the lantern a moment... ...I'll unfasten you in no time. Please do. I'm in a hurry. Oh, dear. Oh, dear me. It could be a long business. Mm. Uh, unless you want me... ...to, uh, cut the material. Then cut it. You don't want me to do that. No need. If you'll just, uh... ...hang on a moment, I'II, uh... Hold still. Be patient, patient. You're not doing anything. I'm looking at a beautiful face. One of the most beautiful faces I've ever seen. Well, it's unwillingly shown. - Oh. Ha, ha. - Oh. I like you the better for that incivility, I must say. You're making it worse on purpose. Please go and leave me here. Impossible, I'm afraid. If I go, I shall drag you with me. And, uh, ha, ha, if I leave you here, well, I'm absolutely bound to stay... ...and keep you company. - Who are you? - Sergeant Troy, ma'am. What are you doing here? Before I entered the service of Her Majesty... ...I used to live here. I always come back for haymaking. Ah, mm-hm. There we are. Free. I only wished it had been the knot of knots. There's no untying. Good night... ...beauty. Ah, Miss Everdene, little did I think it was you... ...the queen of the corn marketer herself, I was speaking to the other night. I'm sorry if I offended you. But it does seem a bit hard. What seems hard? That ill luck should follow a man... ...for honestly telling a woman she's beautiful. It's not your honesty I take exception to. It's your impudence. Miss Everdene... ...you do forgive me, don't you? I do not. How can you blame me for your looks? A woman like you... ...does more damage than she can conceivably imagine. Please go away. I'd rather you didn't talk to me again. I haven't been able to stop thinking about you since I first met you. - Oh. Honestly. I loved you then, at once... ...and I do now. It's not possible. There's no such sudden feeling in people. Evening, Gabriel. Sergeant Troy reporting for sword exercise, ma'am. Sit down. First, I'll show you the cuts. Cut one, as if you were sowing corn. Cut two, as if you were hedging. Cut three, as if you were reaping. And four, as though you were threshing. And from the left: One. Two. Three. Four. Now I'll show you how they look in action. Stand up. - You're the enemy, right? - No! You're not scared, are you? No. Because if you're scared, I can't perform. I promise I won't touch you. Don't move. - Is it very sharp? - No, got no edge at all. Hold still. - Are you sure you're not scared? - Sure. Of course, we usually do them from horseback. I'll show you. Hold still. There's a caterpillar on you. Don't move. Wait a moment. There's a lock of hair needs tidying. Bravely borne. Wonderful in a woman. How did you do that with a sword that has no edge? No edge? This sword will shave like a razor. But you said it... I've been within an inch of my life. I wouldn't say that. I'd say half an inch... ...of being pared alive 295 times. If he marry her, she'll give up farming, all right. Well, I wish I had half such a husband. I'd give up farming, all right. I've heard he's had almost as many girls... ...as there are letters in the alphabet. Mistress will be Y or zed, at the least. Temperance, Money, you're dreadful. I heard what you said. So don't waste time denying it. I simply want you to know I don't care for Mr. Troy in the least. - So don't let me catch you gossiping again. We wouldn't. Because I don't care for him. In fact, I hate him. Do you understand? Hate him. - I hate him too, miss. - We all hate him, miss. He's a wild scamp. You do right to hate him. What do you mean wild scamp? How dare you to my face. By what right have you to hate him? You or anyone? Not that I care for him. I don't. I don't. If I catch any of you saying a word against him... ...I'll have you dismissed instantly, understand? It's your fault. What you said that for? You gossip. Oh, stop. It's not funny. Storm's passing now, miss. Fine tomorrow. I hope you're not still angry, miss. Angry? Oh, no, no. People always say such foolery. From now on I'm gonna tell them, "A lady like Miss Everdene can't love him." I'll say that in plain black and white. You fool, can't you see? - Aren't you a woman yourself? - Miss? I love him to the very distraction and misery and agony. Liddy, come here. Tell me... ...the things they say about him... ...tell me they're not true. They're not true. No, miss. I don't... No, I'm sure they're not true. You only agree with me like that to please me. He cannot be bad as they said. Do you hear? Yes, miss, yes. And you don't believe he is? Well, I don't know what to say, miss. If I say no, you don't believe me. If I say yes, you rage at me. Well, say you don't believe it. Say you don't! I don't believe him to be so bad as they make out. He's not bad at all. I know he isn't. It's just jealousy and gossip that makes them say so. Anyway, he's not here... ...for a few days. I don't often cry, do I, Lid? Why is loving such a misery? - I shall be ruined, Lid. I know I shall. - Oh, no, miss. If he comes back to Weatherbury... Then he must not, miss. He mustn't come back here. No... ...he mustn't. Ladies and gentlemen, and listen to a tale of adventure... ...of a life of which you have never heard before. This is the tale of Captain Cook, and this is his ship. From there, he sailed on into uncharted seas. Never before entered by civilized man. At last, they sighted land, and soon... ...they arrived at Tahiti... ...the paradisiacal island of the South Seas... ...where everyone went naked, as you can see. And lavish entertainment was offered to them. Including dancing girls... ...and other delights of forbidden fruits. But all was not beer and skittles, ladies and gentlemen. For to their horror and dismay... ...the captain and his crew were present next day... ...as a human sacrifice... ...at which the unfortunate victim was tied up... ...and done to death in... Is it working better now, Parsons? All right now, Mr. Boldwood, sir. Oh, Mr. Boldwood. - Good evening, Liddy. - Good evening, sir. Your mistress is back? Well, um... - She's tired? - Rather, sir. You think I might see her for a moment? Oh, she cannot see you, sir, at present. Um, not anyone. Yes, I see. I see. Um, would you tell her... ...that I called her? - Yes, sir. - Would you? - Yes, sir. Good night. Whoa, boy. Much obliged to you, James. Cheerio, Troy. Sergeant Troy? That's my name. I'm William Boldwood. Oh, yes, good evening. I want a word with you. About... About her who lives up there. And a woman you've cruelly wronged. And should have married. Do you really? I wonder at your impertinence. You're gonna have a conversation with me. Very well. No need to raise your voice. I know about you and Fanny Robin. Do you, now? You ought to marry her. I suppose you're right. Unfortunately, I can't. Why not? First of all, she's disappeared. And secondly... ...I'm too poor. I may as well speak plainly. I don't wish to enter into the question of right or wrong. I intend a business transaction with you. I see. Leave Weatherbury, now... ...and you'll take 50 pounds with you. Fanny will have 50 to prepare for the marriage... ...and 500 for you on the day of the wedding. What do you say? - Is that reasonable? - Yes, very. Fifty pounds, right away, did you say? Yes. Seems you've counted on me accepting. I'm afraid she's expecting me. I suppose I better wish her goodbye. I don't see the necessity. Can't you just go? She'll only wander around looking for me. You know women. Tell you what. You shall hear all I say to her. It'll help you in your lovemaking when I'm gone. Wait there. Frank, darling. Is that you? Oh, Frank. It's been so long. You go in. I've left my bag. I won't be a moment. You see my difficulty. - I'll kill you. - And ruin her? It would be a mistake to kill me. Would it not? It could be a mistake to kill you now. Better kill yourself. Far better. She must love you. She must love you indeed. Troy, you've got to make her your wife. Fanny or Bathsheba? - I want to be quite sure I do what... - Bathsheba. And I will help. You shall have the same money as before. Anything you need. As long as you do what is right. She has a right to approve of the arrangement... ...don't you agree? Oh, Mr. Boldwood? Now, what was the arrangement? Fifty pounds to marry Fanny? Sorry, no. Fifty pounds not to marry Fanny, 50 pounds to marry Bathsheba. Only one snag, really. Do you know what that is, Mr. Boldwood? We were married this morning. Thank you, darling. Let us pray. Evening, Gabriel. Evening, thank you. Evening. Good evening. Gabriel. How are you? Just tell the sergeant I'd like a word with him, will you? Right, Gabriel, right. He won't listen, Gabriel. Just tell him there's gonna be a storm. The ricks must be covered or they'll be ruined, the farm along with them. All I need is five men for an hour or two. I'll tell him, Gabriel. Give us a speech, sergeant. Aye, let's have a speech, sir. Friends! Give them an order, sergeant. Ha, ha. Friends, this is more than just a harvest home. This is a wedding feast as well. As you know, not so long ago... ...this lady and I were married. And we've yet to celebrate the occasion. Well, we're gonna celebrate now. I want every man to go happily home to bed. So I've ordered a special nightcap of hot brandy to be prepared. Frank, Frank, please don't give it to them. - They really have had quite enough... - I'll tell you what we'll do, friends. We'll send the women home to warm the beds. And we men will stay and have a carouse to ourselves. What do you say? But let any man show a white feather, and he can look elsewhere for a winter's work. What about a song? - It'll only do them harm. You want a song? Yeah. Yeah. All right. One of them military songs. "Jolly Tinker." Half an hour. Whoo! Gabriel! Yes, ma'am? - Is my husband up there? He's still in the barn, ma'am. What can I do? Tie these ropes to the saddles, ma'am. If you can. Tight! Hold on, Gabriel! Hold on! Well done, ma'am. The storm's going around and around us, luckily. Can you take the weight, ma'am? Gabriel... ...you must understand. Listen, when I went to Budmouth... ...I meant to give up Mr. Troy. I really did. It doesn't matter. I didn't mean to hurt anybody or betray myself. What's done is done. Thank you, Gabriel. Thank you a thousand times. Go in, woman. Go in. Half an hour? Half an hour, indeed. - I told you half an hour. Oh. I've been worried sick all night. Good morning, sir. - Morning. Hello, my beauty. Hela. I'm sorry. Mrs. Troy. Now, come. Worse than what it were three years ago, isn't it? - Have you seen Mr. Boldwood? - I ain't seen him, no. Good morning, sir. Good morning, Oak. How are you, sir? Well. Very well. It's a terrible sight, sir. Possibly. Whatever happened, it's my fault. I don't believe I shall save a tenth of my corn this year. Oak... ...I've been a weak and foolish man. I don't know what I can do. It's this miserable grief. I had some faint belief in the mercy of God... ...before I lost that woman. I know they will laugh about me in the parish. - I don't think so, sir. - I think so, Oak. However, no woman's had power over me for long. We were never really engaged. I wasn't jilted, whatever they say, was I? I won't give up. I wasn't jilted. She never promised. I'll need 2 guineas on the white. Make it 4. Okay, I'll raise you 2. I'll take it. Not dodging the issue, are you, Troy? - I'm not the one for that, Your Lordship. - Still 50 guineas, then? Fifty guineas? Hardly worth my coming. - Make it a hundred. - And 20? If you've got it to lose. Come on, my beauty. Frank. Oh. Frank. Fanny? My God, what are you doing here? I wouldn't have come... ...but I need help. Where have you been? What's happened to you? Why didn't you write to me? I feared to. Is that you, master? - Yes. Yes. Shall I be getting the boy to give him a rubdown, sir? Um, in a moment. In a moment. - You can't stay here. I know, I know. I had to see you, Frank. I am going. I'm going, Frank. - Where? - Casterbridge. - Where will you stay? - The workhouse. You can't stay there. Well, perhaps for tonight. And tomorrow I'll come for you. I'll bring all the money I can lay my hands on. We'll find you some proper lodgings. Eleven o'clock... ...at the Corn Exchange. I'll meet you there. Could you let me have 20 pounds? - What for? - There's another fight tomorrow... ...and if I could raise some cash, I can win back what I lost. - It's not the money I care about, it's just... - Good. I don't want you to go. Oh, Frank, please? Don't. It's only a few weeks ago you said I was sweeter to you... ...than all your other pleasures put together. I am your wife. Frank, what's the money really for? All this grumbling over a little money. I think I have the right to grumble a little if I'm the one who pays. Well, you've had your little grumble, so now suppose you pay. Bathsheba, give me the money... ...or you'll be sorry. I'm sorry already. Sorry about what? My romance has come to an end. All romances end at marriage. I wish you wouldn't talk like that. You grieve me to the soul by being smart at my expense. Well, you're dull enough at mine. When I married you, your life was dearer to me than my own. Frank, I would've died for you. Well, if you repent of marrying... ...so do I. I only repent if you don't love me... ...more than any other woman in the world. Not otherwise, Frank. Don't be so desperate. Don't be so desperate. Frank? That girl you were with, who was she? No one. No one. Go. Get on. Get out. Whoa, boy. Come on in, Joseph. What's the hurry? The poor woman's dead. Nothing will bring her back to life again. Come on, Joseph. All right, Matthew. Get his mug out there. I can only stay a minute. I got to be in before... Have a beer. You'll be out walking the road... Come on. Don't you come home with no weans. I knew you wouldn't pass by without calling. Yeah. Reckon that. Reckon that. Joseph? Joseph? - What time is it? It's past 5. The parson's gone home. - We shall have to bury her in the morning. - Parson? Well, I got a slight attack of the multiplying eye. I got a bit held up. Mistress says to take her up to the house. She can lie there till morning. After all... ...that's where she came from. Move over, Joseph. Come on, now. Up. I'll sit up for master if you like, miss. I'm not at all afraid of Fanny if I may sit in me own room. It's all right, Liddy. I'm all right, you go to bed. Very well, miss. Liddy? - Miss? Fanny passed through Weatherbury yesterday, didn't she? I believe she did, miss, yes. What did she die of? What I heard, miss, was a... A wicked story, l... I can't believe it, so I wouldn't repeat it. Her sweetheart was a soldier, wasn't he? That's right, miss. In Mr. Troy's regiment. Go to bed now. - No, I'll stay with you. Go to bed, please. Please. Miss. It was someone in his regiment. That's what I always said. I always said that. More women than he knew what to do with. Fanny Robin. Leaving her in that condition. Leaving her in that condition. Oh, it's not true. True, right enough. At the Casterbridge Union. Oh, God help me. Oh. Who is it? I must go. I must go. I must go. - I must go, I must... - I want you to stay. Oh, don't, don't, don't. Don't. Don't, don't. I love you better than she did. Kiss me. Kiss me, kiss me. You will kiss me. I'm your wife. In the sight of heaven... ...you are my very wife... ...my darling Fan. I'm your wife. I'm not morally yours. This woman is more to me, dead as she is... ...than you ever were. Or are. Or could be. Almighty God that give us grace... Almighty God that give us grace, that... Almighty God that give us grace, that we may cast away the works... Almighty God that give us grace... ...that we may cast away the works of darkness. Almighty God that give us grace that we may... Almighty God that give us grace... ...that we may cast away the works of darkness... ...and put on us the armor of the light. Almighty God that give us grace... ...that we may cast away the works of darkness... ...and on us put the armor of light. Almighty God that give us grace... ...that we may cast away the works of... Miss! Liddy. - Oh, miss, come in, do. Oh, miss. You must come in. Look at you. Look. Oh, Liddy. - You'll catch your death. No, no, I can't. He's gone. He has? Come on, come on. Oh, no, no, I can't go home yet. I must think. This ain't never worth 3 shillings, you know very well it ain't. - Got a nose to it. - Nose, don't be damn good... Been in the rick for two years. - You know as well as I do. - Two years? That's a bit of this year's corn. That's a fair price. Not bad at all. - I'll give you 50. - How many sacks do you want? - How many you got there? - I've got 56 left. A hundred pound? Forty-four for the quart. - Forty-three. - I be looking for Mrs. Troy. Is that she? Yes, that's Mrs. Troy over there. Yes. Forty-three for the hundred? Mrs. Troy? - Yes. I have some pretty bad news for you. I'm afraid your husband's been drowned. He washed out to sea. What's happened? - Her husband's been drowned. Coast Guard found his clothes and brought them into Budmouth. Must've been washed out to sea. Don't know. Chap just come and said her husband has been drowned. Must be washed out to sea. Poor girl. Get some water. I want to go. I want to go home. Morning, Mrs. Troy. - Morning. Morning, Mr. Oak. Gabriel. Jan? - How are you? Oh, pretty tidy, sir. Thank you. - Good morning. - Ten and six. Good morning, Mrs. Troy. Henery? - Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Oak. Thank you. - Cainy. Sir. In six years, you'll be free to remarry. Even if nothing more is heard of him. I'm willing to wait that long. More than willing. If you are willing... ...to promise that in six years, if you are still alone... We may all be dead. - Six years. - But if we are not. Mr. Boldwood, I will say this. I will never marry another man whilst you wish me to be your wife. I cannot say more. Promise me, that in six years, you'll be my wife. If I can give you happiness by a mere promise... ...not to get married before six years, should my husband not return... Promise. - It is a great honor to me and I cannot... - Promise. ...consider... - Promise. I cannot yet promise. If not yet... ...then when? Soon. Christmas. Christmas. Christmas. Come for Captain Fortesque's famous circus and menagerie. This way, ladies and gentlemen. One penny admission or 2 pennies for a cushion filled with straw. Come on up. Come on up. Come one, come all. For 1 penny, ladies and gentlemen... ...you can see Captain Fortesque... ...representing the infamous Dick Turpin. The finest menagerie in the world. Animals imported from the Far East for your special entertainment. Come and see Captain Fortesque... ...as the infamous Dick Turpin, on his famous pony, Black Bess. For the price of 1 penny admission... ...or 2 pennies for a cushion filled with straw. Draw up, ladies and gentlemen, the show is about to commence. How do you do? Pleased to meet you. Evening, Mrs. Troy. Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Troy. How do you do? Pleased to meet you. Enjoying yourself? Yes, thank you. Very much. You all right, mate? Quiet. - I can't go on. - Don't be ridiculous. I've lost my voice. You were singing your head off a minute ago. That's how it went. They'll tear the place apart. There's 50 pound in there. Listen. To tell you the truth, there's a man out there I owe money to. You've dodged creditors before, haven't you? Brush up your mustache and thicken your voice. It's a risk you'll damn well have to take, captain. Captain Fortesque and his pony, Black Bess. Draw up, ladies and gentlemen. The show is about to commence. Afternoon, sergeant. Not drowned, then, I see. - Story is, you was drowned. - The story was wrong, wasn't it? Had a bit of luck. Got picked up. You always was lucky, wasn't you, sergeant? What are you doing here? Oh, I thought we might do a bit of business together. Just get out, will you? If you like, sergeant. I'm sure Mrs. Troy will be relieved to hear the news. The show is about to commence. Stand and deliver! Your money or your life! Come on out. It'll be the better for you. Don't shoot. Don't shoot, please, sir. Oh, my goodness. Ah! Oh, my lord mayor. This should take some weight off his shoulders. Oh, my good woman. I'll wager she could spare a pound or two. Oh, me pies. Aha! Offi... Officer! Ah. Here's the groom. - Look after her well. She's done me proud. - That's Mr. Pennyways. Keep your mouth shut. Tell no one you recognize me, and you'll not lack your proper reward. But speak to those you shouldn't... ...and you won't live to tell the tale. Ha, ha. Thrust. Thrust. When the spires of York Minster Now burst on my view And the chimes they were ringing a knell Halt Halt, my brave mare They no longer pursue As she halted She staggered She fell Her breathings are over All hushed to her grave My bonny Black Bess Once my pride Now her poor heart has burst Her rider to save For Dick Turpin she lived And she died No. There. - Have you enough chairs? - Plenty. Place them along the wall. - Good. - Gunning. Yes, sir. Gunning, there's no holly with berries. - Find some holly with berries. - I will, sir. Now, you have plates, cutlery, bowls. Have you enough of everything? - I'm not sure, sir. - Not sure? If you're not sure, ask. Understand? There must be no mistakes. If you need anything, send into Casterbridge. This has got to be a great occasion. This house hasn't seen a party like this since I was a boy. - I know that, sir. - Since I was a boy. Yes, sir. Uh... Is there any new knot in fashion, do you know? I don't know that, sir. Plates, please. Over here. "They shall take other stones and put them in the place of those... ...and he shall take mortar and plaster the house." That's no good. "Enter ye in at the straight gate, for wide is the gate... ...and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction... ...and many there be which go in thereat." I don't know what to do. I just don't know what to do. I really believe that if I don't give him my word, he'll go out of his mind. Gabriel, I believe I hold his entire future in my hands. I tremble at responsibility. I hope nothing so dreadful hangs on it as you fancy. Perhaps you should give him the promise that he wants. I think I would. But is it right? Is it right, Gabriel? The only sin, to my mind... ...lies in thinking of ever marrying a man you don't love. Honest and true. You may suppose that love is wanting. Love is an utterly sorry, worn-out, bygone thing. For him or anyone else. Sorry, ma'am, I'm obviously not the right person to advise. Good evening, Mr. Boldwood. Good evening. - Have you everything you need, ladies? - Yes, thank you. Good evening. There's a supper table downstairs. Thank you so much. You're very kind. Enjoy yourselves. Good evening, Mr. Boldwood. - Good evening. Good evening, Mr. Boldwood, sir. Coggan. Fray. Don't feel you have to stay down here. There's dancing here. Food. Help yourselves. I want you all to enjoy yourselves. - That's very kind of you. - Thank you very much. - So you've come. - Oh, yes, of course. I said I would. Yes, you said. I must speak to you. Please, no. Not yet, please. I must. Now. Please, Mr. Boldwood, I do beg of you, please. Please, Mr. Boldwood, I do beg of you. Oh, good evening, Mr. Boldwood. Oh, may I have the pleasure of presenting Dr. And Mrs... - Braybrooke. - Braybrooke. Mrs. Troy. - This is my daughter, Janet. - How do you do? Splendid party. Well, what do you say? Your promise, to give it. Mr. Boldwood, I'm... I'm not the same as I was when... Before... You're still a very beautiful woman. I ask only for the privilege of looking after you. If I say yes, you'll not press me anymore? No. Very well. In six years, if my husband has not returned... ...I will be your wife. - Oh, no, I cannot wear a ring. - As a token... ...of a present engagement, with a marriage at the end. No. Besides I would not want anyone to know about... Wear it tonight. Just for tonight. Please? Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen. I wish to propose a toast. I want you to charge your glasses. Gunning. And when you have, I want you to drink with me... ...to the lady who... Is Mrs. Troy here? Yes, sir. Troy. Troy. Bathsheba. I come here for you. I've come to take you home. Come, madam. Do you hear me? Come. - Aah! Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank, Frank! - Frank. Frank? Doctor, quickly. Here he comes. Frank? - There's nothing I can do, Mrs. Troy. - No. Frank. Frank. No. Frank. Frank. Oh, Frank. Frank. Oh, Frank. Frank. Frank. Frank. Oh, Frank. Frank. Frank. Frank. Frank. Frank. Frank. Frank. Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Frank! Come on. Come on. Hurry. We're late. Good afternoon, Mrs. Troy. Eight months. Seems like yesterday to me. It seems years ago to me. Long years. And I've been dead between. Are you in the choir now, Gabriel? For quite a time now. - Mrs. Troy? - Yes. I've been hoping to have a word. - What? The fact is, I'm thinking of leaving England. - Leaving England? - I don't see much of a future here. California's the spot I had in mind. But I thought you were to have Mr. Boldwood's place. I heard it... I had the offer, but I decided not. That's why I thought it fair to give you clear notice. Oh, I see. Why, I'd hoped that if you leased Mr. Boldwood's... ...you might still give a helping look across at mine. I would have, willingly. Now that I'm at my most helpless, you're going away. Yes. That's the misfortune of it all. And it's because of that very helplessness... ...that I feel bound to go. I see. Yes, ma'am. Well... Good afternoon, ma'am. Oh, Gabriel. You're not really going, are you? Well, I will stay on one condition, and on one condition only. - Well? - This one. That whenever I look up, there you will be. And whenever you look up... ...there shall I be. - Thank you. - Bye-bye. Congratulations. - Congratulations. Thank you. Good night. Good night.
