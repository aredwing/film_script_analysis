Baby, I here by declare this piece of land ours. The final detail. Right. Here. Oh no, for God's sake. Use this. It's just been painted. - Congratulations on your new home. - Thank you. - I want to show you something. - What? Wait and see. Come on, baby. OVER THE EDGE - What's up? - Nothing. I just felt like coming up here to enjoy the view. - Hey, look. There's an eagle. - There is? - I don't see any eagle. - You're looking in the wrong place. No, look at the rocks. See? Somebody wrote something. Somebody proposed. WILL YOU MARRY ME How romantic. Wanna? We bought the house, so why not go all the way? Try it on. Yes. I will marry you. What the fuck? - What was that? - Come on. Daniel! - What's up? - What happened? Do you see anything? What is it? Don't look! We can't just stand here staring. Let's go. - Let's go, baby. - Sure. - Think we should report it? - What? That we saw someone running through the woods. Negotiations are about to break down. And in local news: The police say the death at the Cliffs of Mn was a suicide. And the weather.... Welcome. You are the first to see what I am about to show you. I think it's going to change our view of games and reality. Let me first take a photo of you. I'm going to upload that photo to Real Dreams. Easy as pie. There you go. Now you're actually inside the game. Real Dreams is a life simulator. It enables you to do stuff you may not dare do in real life. - Bo, can I borrow you for a sec? - Sure. Bo is active in the game... now. Everyday life is full of situations. You may have a boss who won't give you the raise - - you think you deserve. And that's the difference between the game and reality. Let's go to Italy on our honeymoon. How about Mexico? Baby, I'm going for a swim. Wouldn't these birdhouses be a good idea at the Geo Center, For the kids? Sure. Kids just love staring at wooden boxes. Very funny. Kids need to experience real life instead of video games all the time. Oh, shit. What the fuck? Crap! Oh, fuck! - Hello. - I came to give you an offer. Come in. Oh, this is bad. Oh, no. The house is about to collapse. All in all you're looking at 550,000. - 600,000. - Plus or minus. Maybe we can do some of it ourselves. - I know. - Get real, baby. You can't put two Lego bricks together without breaking both of them. I know, I know. - I heard about your problems. - Oh? Where did you hear that? Welcome to Mn. Roar, the local handyman. Bricklayer, carpenter, plumber. Hi. Want me to come back, or should we inspect the palace now? - Now? - Sure. Well, come on in. Raining even more inside, huh? - Roar. - Freja. This way. This is completely corroded. Smell this. The water's been trapped behind the wallpaper. All it needs is plaster and paint. It looks worse than it is. What the hell is this? I don't do roofs. I'm afraid of heights. Think you could help me with that, Daniel? - David. - David, right. You need to fix it right away. For your own sake. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Oh, and then there's that. - What is that? - We have lots of bugs down here. - Sure. That bug sounds big enough to try the rides at the fun fair. - I mean... It sounds big. - Sure. But don't worry. I'll fix that too. Okay. So, could you give us an estimate? Yes. - If you want everything fixed... - Yes. - It's gonna cost you 300,000. - 300,000. I know it's a lot of money, but it's a big job. Wasn't it a bit pushy of him to show up unannounced? He's determined... Maybe that's a good thing? Maybe. Let's believe in it then. Let's believe in it all. MN'S HUNTING CLUB Hi. - You're the new one from Tjrnevej? - Yes. - Finn finally got the house sold, huh? - Yes. - The house needs quite a lot of work. - Yes. Luckily we got a great offer. So I heard. - I find your trust admirable. - Trust? Well, I'm not one to gossip... But the man who committed suicide was Roar's former employer. Never mind. You know how people talk. I got hit by a spark. Roar made a glass wall for the birdhouse, so the kids can look inside. - Cool, huh? - Look. I had one just like it as a boy. Roar says he can fix the house in a month, if he can sleep in the shed. The local storekeeper told me it was Roar's former client... ...who died at the cliff. I went to the store too. - What a gossip. - You don't find it strange? Sure. It creeped me out, so I went straight to the local police. It's an open and shut case. The jumper left a suicide note. Gossip runs wild out here. - They just told you that flat out? - Pumpkin, we're in the country. Yeah, we are. Leave your imagination at work, okay? Okay. Roar, how would you like to join us for dinner? Sure. We're gonna be seeing a lot of each other. Well, my ex-boyfriend invited David over. To fix our computer. At first I thought you were a nerd. But then I found out that you were. Just look over there. - You're my nerd. - Then her computer kept going down. So I had to come and fix it over and over again. - So, are you married? - No, but... she said yes. - Can I see? - Sure. - The wedding is on August 7. - Oh yes. And then we're off to Italy on our honeymoon. - No, Mexico. - Italy. - We agreed on Italy. - No, we've been over that. We considered Italy first, and then we decided on Mexico. - I once shot a wild boar in Italy. - Awild boar? It was delicious. - Do you hunt? - Who, me? No, I'm from the city. All we hunt there is parking spots. - Sorry... Oh, parking spots. - Right. They're scarce, you see. But you hunt. So you have all the gear? The whole kit and kaboodle. Except For the feathered hat. How about you? Got a girlfriend? No. I haven't been that lucky. Well, it was a lovely meal. Damn! They sure are low. So, could I sleep in the shed to get an early start? - And finish up in a month? - Yes. Okay. Fine. - That's a deal then. - I'm going for a swim. Good night. Come on. - No, it's freezing. - Come on. It's freezing. Come on! - Your girlfriend is lovely. - Thanks. And so forthcoming. You're a lucky man. SELL YOUR OLD HOUSE TO AVOID FORECLOSURE Does Roar know the realtor Finn Lund? Are you okay? That was Veronika. The widow of the man who died at the cliffs. She's in a bad state. Oh, what a mess. Daniel! Think you could help me with that, Daniel? This water pump is bust. It's gonna cost you a little more than expected. Oh, think you could give me a hand? - Now? - Yes. We need to cover up that hole before the rain sets in. You do remember I don't do roofs, right? Tarp, hammer, nails. I'll hold the ladder, so don't you worry. - But you have to tell me... - Sure, I'll guide you through it. - You're holding the ladder? - I'm right here holding it. There. Tuck the tarp underthe cross-pieces. - There you go. - Roar? - You always stay with your clients? - No, not always. Only when they need the job done fast. It's gonna rain soon. Hurry up. - I can't reach the last cross-piece. - I've got you, David. I promise. Climb another step. There you go. Tuck it in, so the wind won't catch it. Stretch out. You can reach it. It's tucked underthree pieces now. I'm coming down. No, Roar! What the fuck are you doing? Stop! No! Roar! Are you okay? Anything wrong? Just come on down. You're pale as a ghost. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Oh, by the way, thanks for the gift. - The gift? You sure do have a considerate girl. Let me just grab this. Much obliged. They're so cute. They moved in already. The Geo Center already ordered five more. The kids just love them. Roar just... - You gave Roar a hat? - A hat? Yes, he just said so. Oh, that hat? No, Berte gave it to him. The storekeeper. She asked me to give it to him. So why did he say you gave it to him? How should I know? He must have got it wrong. Hey, you can give him a hat. I just want to know. Look, I'd tell you, if I'd given him a hat. I haven't. Are you jealous? Because Roar fixed my birdhouse? You're jealous. Look, I'm not into hicks. I'm into geniuses... like you. That's way too violent, David. It doesn't fit into our universe. Please remove that feature. David? Are you okay? Sure. THE SEASON BEGINS FOR MN'S HUNTING CLUB Freja? DEAR EMPLOYERS A LITTLE GIFT FOR YOU - ROAR DEAR VERONIKA YOUR DANIEL Hi. I just came to thank you For the deer. - Nice one, isn't it? - Very nice. I gotta admit I've fallen in love with her. Trine Dyrholm. But then who hasn't? Hello. We're looking for Roar Panowski Poulsen. - Can we come in? - Sure. Please wait here. It's all a misunderstanding. David? I caught some herring. All that hunting talk inspired me. - You look like you've seen a ghost. - The police just came. They took Roar in. I've got something to show you. You're going through his stuff? Fuck, it's gone! He must have seen me. I found a note before addressed to Veronika and signed Daniel. - Who are they? - Roar's former clients. Daniel died at the cliffs. It was Daniel's suicide note. - Why would Roar have that? - Maybe it wasn't the real note. Maybe... - Maybe it was a draft. - A draft? Maybe Roar wrote Daniel's suicide note. - You're saying that Roar? - Yes. To practice his handwriting. - What did it look like? - A handwritten note on ruled paper. Could this be it? No. It was addressed to Veronika. - Think he'd keep the note, if he... - Why else would the police show up? I don't know. Maybe they caught him speeding or something. In his tractor? No. Who's there? There! In front of you! Man, you looked funny! I was just taking the piss. Sorry. Island humor. Look, I get that you're... Okay, let me cut to the chase. A couple of months ago I was at the Duck, when these... Is that herring? Can I have one? Anyway, I was at the Duck, when these two fishermen got into a fight. There's this vendetta between the east and the west part of the island. I tried to split them up, and suddenly I'm attacked. - By a dog. - A dog? Yeah, believe it or not. Look. No! The local cop, Jensby, always has his dog with him. And it bit me. So now the police arrest me for assaulting an officer and his dog. - I hope I didn't have you concerned. - No... yes. Sometimes your imagination gets the better of you. And then I come charging out like a loonie. Baby, come over here. - I'm really sorry about that. - It's okay. I'm going to the bathroom. - This is nice. - They took you in for questioning? HUNTING HA Are you asleep? What if he was lying about that fight? Look, David... You saw the wounds on his leg. That could be anything. What if the police took him in for questioning about the suicide - - but had to let him go on lack of evidence? What if he's conning the lot of us? I think he's lying. And even worse, I think you're lying too. - You think I'm lying? - You gave Roar that hat. Here. Hunting hat, 299. You go through my stuff, David? Are you jealous? Is that what this is about? You've got everything wrong. Berte asked me to give Roar that stupid hat because he mows her lawn. It got mixed in with my groceries, and she accidentally put it on my bill. But we found out, and she punched out a new bill, without the hat. I've got two bills, and you just found the old one. You expect me to believe that? David, I've had it! Freja... Come back to bed. Come back inside! Freja, stop it. Don't sit there. Let's go back inside and talk about it. Happy now? No hat! I'm sorry, baby. I got it all wrong. Aren't you going to work? Sit down for a sec. David, I don't know you anymore. I don't know what's going on with you. What happened to that relaxed, fun guy? Where are you? What's happening to you? He's not coming between us. - You are. - I know. But it ends here. I promise. If I get myself all worked up again, I have these two - - to remind me that I'm the fool. It's just me. Okay, it's nothing. Gotcha! Cute little marten, huh? Hey, wait! Can't you... set it free or something? It's just gonna come back. No more scratching sounds. David. You forgot your bag. Thanks. - Sorry. I had a terrible morning. - Finally. Let's get started. - You're gonna like this. - I hope so, David. Okay, let's get started. If it's good, I guess it's worth waiting for. You're gonna like this. Have you still got that handyman staying with you? Yes. In orderto get the job finished faster. It turned out to be a great idea. Nothing fishy about that suicide? No, they were just stupid rumors. Too bad. I had my sights set on a real murder mystery. - Call it a work hazard. - How do you mean? The handyman fucks the wife. The wife falls For the handyman. The husband understands nada, and they push him over a cliff. Feigning a suicide. But that's only the beginning, because the handyman craves fresh meat - - and Freja's too hot, and David Hjort understands nada. I'm just making it up. David. - Berte? - Yes. Have you got Veronika's address? What do you want from Veronika? In 100 meters, turn right. Turn right. THE CLIFF WOODS Make a U... Make a U-turn. Hi. How come you use the back door? Sorry, I didn't know. But does Veronika live here? - Sure. Come in. - Thanks. Veronika. Sorry, I don't think she's there. Excuse me. My name's David. I hired this handyman, Roar... Have you got a minute? - Are you married? - Engaged. - And Roar is working at your house? - Yes. I'd advise you to fire him right away. And now I want you to leave. I just need to ask you... Did you go to bed with Roar? I just want to understand what happened. - How did you meet him? - The realtor knew him. Please go. Finn Lund? You bought a house. It seemed to be in good shape, but it wasn't. Did Roar suggest he move in with you as well? Is that Daniel? Yeah, and he doesn't deserve to hear this. Oh, it's whisky. Our house was out by the cliffs. It was perfect, apart from a little plumbing - - so we contacted Finn, and he knew Roar. Roar became a close friend. A little too close. One night I came home - - and found my diary on the kitchen table, open. And Daniel wasn't home. And then I saw him. He was standing on the edge of the cliffs, and I ran to him. I begged him to understand that this thing with Roar didn't mean anything. It was just a fling. He didn't even get mad. He said he understood. He had been too distant. And then he asked me to go back home. So I did. And on the way back I realized something was terribly wrong. Daniel would never read my diary. So I ran back, and then I heard a scream. And Daniel was gone. I saw someone running into the woods where Daniel stood. - So did I. - It was Roar. He stood there waiting for Daniel to jump. But he didn't. So he... He pushed him, you see? You've reached Freja. Leave a message. Freja, I just talked to Veronika. Roar did it! Get out of the house. Roar. I'm happy with your work, and I'll pay what I owe you. - But our collaboration ends here. - Baby... I don't want to... Hey! I don't want to discuss it. Freja and I are going for a walk, while you pack up your stuff. Pack up and be gone by the time I return. - Or else I'm calling the police. - Oh, come on... Stay away! Freja, come here. Come here! - What the hell is going on? - I talked to Veronika... I got your message, and I tried to call. Roar told me all about it. Veronika is nuts. She's badmouthing Roar because he rejected her. - And you believe him? - Sure! And you should too. Are you in love with him? Where are you? Look into my eyes. What's going on? - David, don't. - Look, he's dangerous. He was cooking dinner! And so was I as a matter of fact. If you call the police, it's over. He's inside. - Did you get in a fight? - No, but he won't leave. Roar, the complainant wants you off his property. Please leave. - Do you want me to... - No. Look, I live here too. Roar is our handyman. He lives in the shed. He no longer lives in the shed, and I want him out of my house now. - Come with me. - No... Roar wrote Daniel's suicide note. I saw a draft among Roar's things. That note was addressed to some Vera. - You didn't see the same note. - I did. - David has been stressed out. - She's got it all... Baby, listen to me! You've got it all wrong. I talked to Veronika... Be quiet! You, stay here. - I talked to Veronika. - Look. I understand your concern. I've heard the rumors about Roar, but I investigated this case - - and three independent witnesses saw Roar that night at the Duck. But they're Roar's friends. Off the record, Veronika is a bit... you know. It's tough to have driven your own husband over the edge. Sometimes you search for an explanation to ease your own guilt. You know? Lene! No, don't just leave. I hope you work things out. Try talking to someone. NEED HELP? CALL ME David. This just isn't working. You're not yourself. What with the police and the iron bar... I just don't know you anymore. Freja... I have to give this back to you. I'm sorry. This just isn't working. You're not yourself. I have to give this back to you. Are you asleep? - I think you're lying too. - You think I'm lying? Are you asleep? It's okay if you gave him a hat. David, I love you. Leave your imagination at work, okay? Come on! Try it on. Yes. I will marry you. I will marry you. I will marry you. David? I saw you from my window. Are you okay? Come on. You shouldn't be out here alone. - What are you doing? - Relax. Just hold on to the rope. What if we're the crazy ones, you and I? - Here. Put these on. - Three witnesses saw him. Sure, but I just know I saw Roar that day on the cliffs. No thanks. It's so depressing to smoke alone. Have one. - David speaking. - Detective Tom Jensby here. I was at your house the other day. I'm writing my report and just need to get a few things straight. - You have the note you mentioned? - No. If you find it, I'd like to see it. I checked out the witnesses - - and Roardoes in fact know one of them from the hunting club. However, the other two check out. I just thought I'd correct that little error. - Call us, if you find the note. - But still... Bye. Veronika. I dreamt we were... in Mexico. The police just called. You were right. Roar did know one of the witnesses. Did you hear me? I bet it's Finn. Got any coffee? They asked me about the note too. I bet Roar burnt it. Have you still got Daniel's suicide note? Can I see it? Roar wrote this. I recognize it from the draft. We must give the police proof. We'll just pretend we have something. Video games are about making people believe something that isn't real. We'll tell Roar we found the pad he wrote the suicide note on. We found the pad with his fingerprints on. If he did it, he's bound to believe us. Mexico. You want to move to Mexico and start over. And you need money for the trip. He has to pay for your trip. I'll get Freja out of the house. On my cue, go in and talk to Roar. - I'll be monitoring you. - What if he didn't do it? What if I'm imagining things? You're scared, and I understand that. But he can't harm you, because he thinks we've got proof. I can't. "When you read this, please know that you were always on my mind." "When I'm gone, look to new horizons." "Remember that time heals all woes." "Your Daniel." It's beautiful no matter who wrote it. It's "wounds". Isn't it "time heals all wounds"? Yes. - What was Daniel's job? - He was a school teacher. - David, do you hear me? - Yes. Quiet. Freja's close-by. Freja. - What's up? - She just went inside. - I'll think of something. - Careful. Stand by. The water's back. - I reopened the old well. - It's been closed? You're tapping into the womb of Mother Earth. David? - Crystal clear water. - It looks clean. Let's celebrate with a toast of Mn's finest. - Now you can water your sunflowers. - Yes. No, Roar. It's too soon after David. I understand. Hey! Who's there? I know this seems crazy, but I have to talk to you. I just need ten minutes with you on the beach. Say you're going for a walk alone. If you ever loved me, do this for me. Is she coming out? Yes. Ready? Go on in. I start recording now. - What's going on? - I know it seems crazy, but trust me. I came to return these. I knocked, but there was no answer. I just wanted to see you face to face and say goodbye properly. I'm knocking now. Ready? - Veronika. What do you want? - I've got something to show you. - The pad you wrote the suicide... - What are you up to? Nothing. Freja, no matter what... - I cherish our time together. - Me too. David doesn't know I took the pad. I want to start over in Mexico. - What are you talking about? - Buy my ticket, and you get the pad. - Am I going to Mexico? Yes or no? - What are you talking about? - Want me to go to the police? - What are you doing with that thing? No. Let's keep them out of it. Come here. I want to show you something. Listen. And look at the house. - How much do you want? - 20,000. If he agrees, it's to stop her from going to the police. And you don't say a word to Freja nor to the police? You've got some nerve. Will you give me the money? Okay. I'll give you the money. There's our proof! Let's go. We're going to the police. Let's go! What's going on? Someone's coming. - Finn. - Are you there? Veronika, run! They've got a gun. But... Oh no... Freja, call the police. Check down there. - Shout, if you see her. - Veronika! I've got your purse. Finn! - No! Let me go! - Take it easy. Roar! Let her go. - Are you in on this too? - Don't touch me. Put that down! - Throw down that iron bar. - But it's not me. Throw it down! On the ground, now. On the ground! - They were chasing us. - That's not true. We were going hunting and just wanted to return her purse. Don't listen to him. He hasn't done anything. - Send an ambulance immediately. - What are you doing? It's just a phone. We've got his confession. It's true. Listen. I can prove Roar committed the murder at the cliffs. - I've got something to show you. - What are you talking about? Listen. - We all know she's out to get you. - Hey, what is this? - Finn. - Is that hers? Finn? How did he get into the recording? - Shit. She dropped her purse. - And so what? I have to return it, or she'll accuse me of stealing too. - I must have dropped my purse. - Everyone knows you didn't do it. - Why did you say yes? - What if the police buys her proof? - So Roar wasn't guilty? - Yes. - But they said... - He was putting on an act. - I had to buy me some time. - She can't prove anything. - You didn't do it. - Help me find her. As I was trying to say, we were going hunting - - and just wanted to... return this to the lady. - David, get real. - You don't know how cunning he is. If you don't let me out of this jail - - that psycho will become the father of my child as well. David, I've seen those pictures. This isn't a jail. Roar is just an ordinary guy. And Freja chose him herself. - You don't understand. - I do. That's the way it is. - I'm just trying to help you. - Yes. Face it. You were wrong. If you tell them this at the evaluation meeting on Friday... Zyprexin. For psychosis and schizophrenia. This is what they give the patients they've given up on. That's what they give Veronika. You're too good to spend the rest of your life here. You know what you have to do, if you want to get out of here. It may feel awkward - - but it will be a relief to get it off your chest. Yes. - Are you ready, David? - Yes. - Hi. Roar. - Clara. Hello. - Coffee? - Yes, please. - No, I'd rather have some water. - Sure. Thank you. Welcome. I'm glad you came. I know that David has got something important to say to you. - Am I right? - Yes. Roar. I accused you of something - - that wasn't true. I know that now. And... I want to apologize for that. Freja, I want to apologize to you too. Do you remember - - when we stood on the cliffs? I felt like the luckiest man alive when you agreed to marry me. I know I was the one who came between us. I want you to know I wish you all the best. I wish both of you all the best. - We have all we need now. - Thank you for coming. - You did very well, David. - Thank you. I'll just go and say goodbye. I'm sorry, but I forgot... See you, David. By the way... I'm sorry it had to end like this. I wish you all the best too. I hope you get well and are discharged from here soon. Rememberthat time heals all woes. - What did you say? - Time heals all woes. No, Roar. Time heals all wounds. That same mistake was in Daniel's suicide note. No! Wardens, help! Help! Help! Wardens, help! - He attacked me. - He's lying! Calm down! Get him! PSYCHIATRIC WARD Roar just revealed himself. He said "time heals all woes". - What? - Freja's still here. I have to get hold of her. Maybe he said it before. When do you use that expression? "Time heals all wounds." When you think you'll never get over something. And when do you think that? Yes. Freja... It's too soon after David. The suicide note. Call the police and get Clara outside in two minutes. Trust me. Hey! What am I gonna tell them? We're not crazy. Okay? Stop! Freja, I need to talk to you. That night... - Did you just hit Roar? - No. Listen to me. - That night you got the water back... - Don't listen. What did he whisper to you? Listen to me. Let go of me! Give me just one minute. - Listen to me. Let go. - You promised to help him. Okay, David. What do you want to say? - That night the water came back... - This is absurd. He wanted to kiss you, but you said no, and he whispered something. What did he say? Roar just said that time heals all woes. That same mistake was in Daniel's suicide note. Think. Has he said that to you too? Freja... - Freja, let's go. - You do remember. Come on. He said... Time heals all woes. Yes. That same mistake is in the note. Let go! - It's the same mistake. - Move, Roar. No! - Enough about this stupid note. - No! It doesn't mean a thing. Freja, get in and let's go home. Freja... Freja. - Come on, Freja! - Here! - Look. - It does say so. And why has he got blood on his hands, when I haven't? Roar, can you explain this? Let me go! What if I hadn't figured out what Roar whispered to you? I might still have been locked up. What makes you so sure that was what he said? - What do you mean? - What if... What if I made it up? Maybe he just asked me to go for a swim. - I don't get it... - It's kicking. Do you feel it? David. Now you tell me what happened. For the last time. The truth and nothing but. Okay?
