Let me never forget my sacred and holy vows onto Thee and I should not be prey onto demons and devils, and all the dark things of this world. Honour me with the armor of Thy righteousness. Give me the sword of truth, that I shall confound mine enemies... ...and be onto Thee... the true knight. They blockade the path! This way! Guard! Fall back! COVEEER!! - Jacob, we can stop this. - Stop now, we lose more men. There is no stopping this [...] - We can outflank them. - There are women and children in it. - They won't be hurt. - They WILL be hurt. We end this today! WITH ME!! - Your Highness. - With Allah's help we may still prevail. - The time for false hope is over. There is one final request I must beg of you, my friend. Haven't you had enough of this - killing for hypocrite priests? - We do God's work. - The blood we spill here is on our blades. Our souls, not God's! We don't have to do this anymore. We can just go. - Go where? - East. No one goes East. - Cannot be any worse than here. - You doubt our cause? - You're not the man you once were. - None of us are. Go there. Go East! You know, I swore an oath to your father. My father is dead, you are released of your oath. I release you. Go! - Father. - Papa! Hassan will escort you away from here. I will see you again... very soon. You have to be strong. You have to be strong. For the children, for us. My love. GOD WITH US!!! Stop, this is finished. Leave. My days draw to an end, my son. - No, father! - They do... child. That is the nature of life. All that is left for me... ...is to ensure my Kingdom receives the leader it deserves. Which is why I have chosen you... ...to sucseed me. - Me? But... Shing? - Your brother is a great warrior. Now it's the time for peace. That is my request of you. Father, no one will follow me. They will... ...because you will be King. Majesty, Prince Shing approaches the gates. Our time is less than we thought. Qiang Long, the royal seal. Yes, your Majesty. Qiang Long will escort you... ...ensure that you all safely reaches the General Sen Ching Wen. I will protect him with my life. I have made none of these decisions lightly. Which is why... I have chosen you. Father. Out of necessity, Lian. A King... tends more to his sons. But it does not mean... he has any less love for his daughter. I trust you... with your brother's life. With the future of our Kingdom. Go now. Majesty. - It's been a long time. - Too long, my son. I came as soon as I heard of your declining health. My health has always been a concern of yours. I have other concerns, father. About... rumors I've heard. Rumors... are the distraction of children and old women. Indeed. Unless they are true. And... what rumor carries... such weight, my son? Perhaps we should summon my baby brother to discuss it? Unfortunately, your brother is away from the palace. I fear your ill health is clouding your judgment, father. The throne is my BIRTHRIGHT!! I earned it, fighting your wars! Without you... there would be no Kingdom... ...but everything! I've given everything for you. I know... my son. But please... ...it is in the best interests of the people. - What... do you know about THE PEOPLE?! - Prince Shing! My son means me... no harm. My father must trust you very much. You have family? A wife? Children? Resist me and I will see that your children are nailed to the walls of your home... - ...one piece at a time. - Shing! That your wife spends the rest of her life pleasuring my guards. Die for a King whose time has passed... or choose to serve a new one. - Leave us. - Out! All of you. Remember this blade, Father? Your mother... once saved my life with it. When I was old enough... she gave it to me. And told me I would be King. But you are not the child she loved. Where is the seal? Where. Is. The. Seal? Heaven... forgive him. Heaven is closed to me... because of all the things I've done for you. The King... is dead. Murdered. By Prince Qiang. He stole the royal seal. Bring it to me. Follow me. Keep your men under control. Summon General Gao. Now. Or should I send for your family? The horse! Stop them! Go! Maybe we should just keep going? And how far will we get? We have no horse. We need help. - You stay here. - But Lian, I should go! Father chose you, because he knows you are strong. Whatever happens, you keep going. You reach the Generals. And you will be King. Be careful. Here. No money, no food. When you first came in, I thought you might be the White Ghost. I guess I was wrong. Is that the Princess? I seek an escort for the road. I can pay. What use is coin to the dead? The Black Guards are hunting you. Look who I found skulking outside! I'm sorry, I did not see them. - My father will hear of this. - So the dead have ears. No, my father is not dead. It's not true! Oh, you know it is. After all it was you who murdered him. - Or was it you, Princess? - Shing. The seal, where is it? You mind? Hold them. No! Stop it. Give it back to me! - The seal is mine! - Cut these throats. The sword... is mine. It belongs to me. I'd like it back. Then come. Take it. Opium. Your kind are such fools. Clean him up. Kill him. - Lian. - Qiang! Either way, the boy dies. - Kill him then, I just want my sword back. - If I give it to you, then will you leave? You have to help us. Good luck, Princess. Wait! Much obliged. Wait. Qiang, come. Please! Help us. We must get to Shing Yuing. If your reward is what you seek, we have gold. My brother is the Kingdom's only hope. If you don't help us, we will be killed. Come. You will be if you stay here. Do what you must, but there are riders down below. - How many? - Wake the boy. Quietly. Shh. We have to hide. Keep looking! Why did you come back? You had your sword. You promised gold. And I was having that way, anyway. What brings you to our lands? I know. But it's all we have. Let's stop. Wait here. I said, wait. This is our fault. - They need help. - We need to go, come on. You can't just go! Wait! How is that possible? - Let me go! - Come on! You're welcome. It's great. I'm only trying to help. All right? - I'm Lian. - I'm Qiang. And you? Xaoi. Beautiflu name. We can't just abandon her. It's one more mouth to feed, and one more body to hide. They seek three, not four. All right. That shot. How did you make it? Practice. We go off the map, get through the woods. Hopefully we won't see any Black Guards until Ching Shao. Your Majesty, General Gao. - Lord Shing. - Majesty. - Lord Shing. - Majesty. How many of your fellow generals will offer support to the boy? - Once the Council has officiated over the appropriate ceremony... - Yes... ...can't be no ceremonies without the seal. But... if he... has the seal, there's nothing to be done. He murdered my father. Stole the Seal. If that's the case... ...he will be punished. Accordingly. It's inexcusable. Even from a Prince. Forgive me, General. My father's murder has left me overemotional. They will be heading to Shing Yuing. Make sure they never get there. I'm sorry, for what Shing's men did. He murdered my father, too. For what, a few coins and a rusty plough? Does it matter what it was for? I want to make things better, for people like you! Do you think it makes a difference for people like me - who sits on the throne? It should. And we change things. You don't believe me? I believe you're just a boy, and Shing Yuing is still faaar away. And yet, it's closer than yesterday. We'll make camp here. I needed that. Tear of the poppy. Dull the man's senses. Some things are better dulled. Our lives and the future of our Kingdom... ...depending upon your wits. Your Kingdom. You're far from home. Are you running? Or searching? Both. Your people... - ...do they believe in Hell? - We believe in Diyu. The realm of the Dead. One is assigned to one of 18 levels. A place of heart [...]. The Lake of blood. The punishment fits the crime. What was yours? Ohh... there've been many. We all have our weights to bear. No doubt, the life of a Princess... is a heavy burden. Do you know what it's like - being a woman in this world? Do you think watching men destroy everything you care about bears no weight? And for what? Pride? Greed? You warriors march off and forge new worlds. We have to stay behind, to raise the children. We have to explain why their fathers don't return. And we have to fix the broken creatures that do. Do not judge my life. - When you know nothing about being a woman. - I'm sorry. A Princess... is a woman, too. I am, what you wanted of me. I did what you needed, but couldn't. I will have what is mine. Wake up. I want to fire arrows like you. Teach me. Teach me! I thought White Devils didn't bathe. A man picks up bad habits when he is away from home. You've been in many battles? I wish to become a great warrior, too. My father wanted me to learn from books, not have to fight. Teach me! - Why? - My father... Shing must pay. Please. Teach me. Battle is both craft and art. First you must learn to craft. Then you push past it, until action and reaction become instinct. A part of you. The man who taught you, was he a great warrior? Use your back, allright? Not your shoulders. Release. Fire. Fire! I'm sorry! Better. - You're good with my brother. - The boy has a good heart and mind. Like his sister. If we'd gone East, we'd already been nearing Shing Yuing. Where do you think the most of Black Guard are concentrated? Once we get past Ching Shao, there is less chance that they follow. They follow [...] where my brother instructs. In the Silver Mountains there said to be bandits who despise your brother and his men. You mean the White Ghost. Wouldn't he despise us equally? Quiet, stay low. We should move on, quickly, Mount off. Thank you. - No thanks. You're welcome. Ching Shao. Everyone will be looking for you. We need to find a way in. - Greetings. - Greetings. I'm travelling with my mistress and her servant boy, searching for new company. You will find us extremely hospitable, for the right price. You and your lady are welcome to join us. She's shy, she enjoys her privacy. She will enjoy it so much more in a city full of strangers. You gave her your gold. I'll see you are properly rewarded when we reach Shing Yuing. Stay calm. Dismount slowly. - Out of the cart! - What seems to be the problem? We are searching for the Prince and Princess. You'll find nothing of interest here. Let them through! Come on, let's go. You did well. - You should stay with us. - I think my mistress would prefer to keep travelling. You're exhausted, and think of the children. I have private rooms, your mistress will appreciate the privacy. Waht are you looking at? You are hungrier than you appeared. Take my guests to clean up. They must be tired. Stay. I have something that may interest you. Make sure you are fit to travel. Thank you for your hospitality. It's all to your health. This way. - Are you all right? - Of course I am. - He served us well. - Did anyone say he hasn't? Now go and get cleaned up. I want to be ready to leave first thing tomorrow. - It's still early. - Just do as I say, Xiaoli. If you'll excuse me, I have some business to attend to. What did you give me? Help the man! Apparently he can't handle his drink. It's not you they want! They're worth more money than you've ever seen! Your share alone! I already have a mistress. - Come on, you have to go. Come on, now! - What happened? Let's go! We've been betrayed. - Hurry, this way. - Wait, our horses! You'll never pass the city gates. Go to the river and find a boat. Head downstream, wait for me at the Silver Mountain. - There are bandits! - I know, that's where I was going. - And you? - I'll meet you there. If I don't arrive, Shing Yuing is a day beyond the mountain. I don't even know your name. Please Lian, go. Go now! Allright, just go. Untie them all. Go search the building! Don't kill him yet! Where are they? Speak quickly. Tell me now, or I kill you. General, Prince Qiang and Princess Lian are on the river headed toward the Silver M ountains. Go after them. Get to the shore! Run! Let me go! Let go! Open your mouth. It was my choice, I would have let you rot. - My companions? - Safe! The Black Guards are as thick as flies on a fart [...] ask because of you. You brought them here. - How did you find me, lad? - Nobody goes East. Remember? There is few [...] of our kind beyond Baghdad. - We need to talk. - We have nothing to say. - Please. I should have left you in the woods. For [...] But you didn't. As soon as you can move, you leave. Gallain. Gallain, please! - Please. He lives? - For now. - You're the outlaw they call the White Ghost? - I am the White Ghost. But no one calls me outlaw, child. Not to my face! - Your friend sent us here. - My friend? And you expect that to count in your favor? - You saved our lives. - Well, killing Black Guards, that was no hardship. Your lives have value. Yes, my love. - Shing will pay handsomely for your return. - Or he might just kill you. Outlaw! If we escape my brother, I will be the King. - How old are you? 10? - 14! - And I should help you, because? - I will give you a reward! - And you may come down from this mountain! A free man. - Now, I do not know. In my experience those who climb to the top only ever remember they got there by their own effort. - I won't forget! - Maybe you will, maybe you won't. I need time to think. You are lucky my wife likes you. Where is my wine?! Free them, they got nowhere to run. You were his friend. We fought alongside one another. - He belives he's damned. - He's right. We were, all of us - killers. But he became... ...more than that. - That what warriors do! - Some get a taste for blood. He is not one of them. There was a time I wanted that to be true, as much as you do now. At least he still sees hope in others. Puts his sword at the service of that, rather than his own game. Your Majesty, we have news! Saddle the horses. Jacob... - My name is Jacob. - Nice to meet you, Jacob. - I am sorry. - For what? We'd never have come this far without you. You... don't have to do that. I know. I want to. There's not much else to do here, except watch Xaoi eat. She lives because of you. As do we. Maybe you've repaid your debt. Rest, for now. Please, help me. I must see him. What? Oh man, don't you ever stop? Here, fucking opium. It keeps the ghosts away, huh? This is MY medicine. What you saw that day... If it's forgiveness that brought you here, you've come a long way for nothing. Perhaps you've come to tell me it was some terrible mistake? - That you didn't kill them? Huh? - I can't tell you that. But they did not die by my sword, I promise. Riddles give me headaches. The children were killed by their own mothers. The women died by their own hands. Because they fear of what you have become. Yes. What is it? You think if you save this boy, God will forgive you? Men can not know God's will, and when they pretend to... - ...it ends in blood. - That I'll drink to. So what happened to you? The White Ghost, bandits? I tried my hand as a merchant. But the Black Guards took all I had. My wife - she's good with a knife, aint't it? But in one time... she had the most... beautiful... singing voice. But the... Guards... ...cut out her tongue!! Blinded my right eye. But I still have her. Which is all that really matters. If Shing becomes King, this land will burn. All lands burn, Jacob. You know that. Better than anyone. I have to take a piss. You should be resting. I'm younger and healthier than you. I made a promise to my father. I swore to him... ...I'd protect Qiang with my life. But you... ...why? I once looked for God in all of the wrong places. But you... your brother... It started to make sense again. My father would have liked you. Ohhh, I don't know. I think your father would have taken my head. And rightly so. Perhaps to the man we first met. But you... he would have loved. Lian, I... He's been out there for hours. With the right people by his side he will hold the peace. You sound like one of those priests that blessed us as we marched off to war. The ghosts... - ...you really see them, too? - Only when I let my guard down. And what do they ask of you? - Mine don't talk. - They don't need to. And if they did? What would the dead whisper? What is ought, must be paid. It's not for us to decide when, though. To the damned, each and every one of us. You are not hard enough on him. - Gallain, with your help... - No! I told you before! I'm done fighting other men's causes. - Ah, you could have handed him over to Shing. - I'm a simple man. Easily bedazzled by swift-talking young Princess. You are many things, none of them simple. They have [...] reached the riverbank. We have no choice now. Make what preparations you can! No more that four bombs in each bag. I chose this place for a reason. We beat them down below, take as many as we can. - Bring confusion. - Fall back to the caves? - No, you stay here. - But they're here for me. And if you die on the Mountain, you will never be the leader your father wanted. Be careful. SHIELDS!! SHIELDS UP!! SHIELDS!!! Return fire! RETURN FIRE NOW!!! Fall back!! Get back to the cave, now!! Back to the cave, we'll finish them there! LET'S GO!! - Get your sister and Xiaoli back to the inner cave. - I should stay! - You've got nothing more to prove, all right? Men have died for you, don't let that be in vain. Go! Go now! Mei!! NOW!! The Black Guards!! GO!! GO, MEI, GO!! Go... get the boy... now! You want my blood? You want my BLOOD?! - The others? - Oh, it's just Gallain. We have to leave, before more Black Guards arrive. I see you... ...woman... I see you... Qiang Lian and the white monkey. Did you help them? Or was it this one? No. I think this one is the White Ghost. - Why? - Because... ...the boy isn't like us. And what are we like? The world will be better without us. And you... little brother. Do you really think bandits and barbarians can win you the throne? Our father would hate what you have become. Then it's probably a good thing you killed him. You've spilled a lot of blood today. Let's see how much you have left. Who [...] his bow, dies! Careful, then. You might cut yourself. No more, Shing... no more... Lian, no!! Lord Shing is dead. - Sister! - I'll be all right. - What were you thinking? - Of my country... And Qiang... I love you... I'm sorry. Your Majesty. Please, forgive me.
