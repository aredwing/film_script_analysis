Authorities believe - it was a terrorist attack. - We are suspects now? The CCTV is rigged too Police have found CCTV footages of the two suspects fleeing the hotel shortly before the blast After analysis on the footage Police concluded that the two men are very likely to be accomplices of the A Hotel attack in Singapore. Interpol has been contacted for assistance. Interpol has already issued arrest warrant on the five suspects We're criminals now. Making money is hard. What did Sam say? Who's Sam? Sam the reporter! You don't even know the client's name! How can you be a bodyguard? How do I know who that reporter is! How could you? You talked with him - Fine, you are always right. - I... Over at the car park Babe! You even asked if today is his birthday No! What are you talking about... What did Sam say? Those messages are vital for catching the real terrorists. Why should we believe you? It's up to you, I just want my answers. Babe! He doesn't believe you but I do! Don't be mistaken! It's not the right answer! Don't underestimate us How can you tie people up this way? Figure 8 knot is too loose - You should have - Bro! Used diamond knot. See how hard it is to undo? You need to exert a bit self control. There's no need to pass out three times a night. He is Wong Bok Yo, born in Hong Kong, 38 years old. An Interpol a year ago, now just a security service agency owner. He is Lee San, Korean, 28 years old. Wong's partner at Interpol. Both were fired after a failed mission in London a year ago. Listen, only we can help you. We are both Cat is a legend among bounty hunters Bounty hunters? How did bounty hunters become terrorist suspects? We've been tracking the Singapore hotel terrorist suspect. We've been framed also. But we did see that terrorist. We made this sketch, but haven't got his ID. Purandhri Dhupam. Bomb specialist. How did you know him? It's my weakness, photographic memory. Just one glance and it's stored here. Dhupam I've heard he later joined a criminal enterprise Then fled to Thailand. We told you everything. What did Sam tell you? This information is too expensive to be given away He said he's looking for a guy called Sipuan in Bangkok. That's all we have. Dude why did you give away everything! Don't you know the basics of negotiation? Quid pro quo Wanna go to Bangkok with us? What? Just wanna be partners before clearing our names. You'll take all the bounty when it's settled. We're not short of money. It's a $2 million reward. Happy to work with you! One condition: I'll be the leader. Yes boss! Babe! Drink a toast to our partnership? Cheers! I'm not interested in partnership. I'll leave when my name is cleared. Relax man, take it easy. We're wanted by the Interpol now, can't even get out of Korea, let alone Bangkok Don't worry, Babe will take care of it. Ok To partnership! To partnership! To partnership! Drink and be merry! Please!

The delivery guy seems weird We have to tell them now! Don't worry, San is really good. A Chinese ship was hijacked by African pirates, one guy captured all the pirates, and saved 23 crew members.

Just scared, come back please It's not a good time I really miss you, come home tonight ok? I'm sorry, I need to take care of something. Gotta go, I love you That's about it There's nothing useful there What a man... It's not useless He must be around, he misses this woman What more did he say? Have you located his cellphone? Almost there! What's going on? Look! A Hotel! Sipuan? Sipuan is not a person's name... How's the situation? It could be the next terrorist attack target Don't jump into conclusion Look how scared you are Not scared, just cautious. Swan, find out which room the guy's staying I'll check the hotel guest registry Wait, rewind 12th floor. Swan, enlarge here Got it! Room 1210 How did you do it? I sent him a message as his girlfriend. Said I'm at his door Told you he misses this woman. Wait here, I'll go alone Wait, I haven't... He'll check with his girlfriend! Sam's got one minute max! Hurry up! Why don't you go? No necessary, he's the guy who caught Osama bin Laden. Not the African pirates? First caught the pirates in Africa, then bin Laden in Iraq bin Laden... was caught in Afghanistan Really? Maybe it was Saddam Hussein? He was an Indian commando after all, have to be careful I'll take care of myself, you should be careful What's so miraculous Why are there so many bombs? How long until they go off? You know what these are? I saw them in The A hotel in Korea! You were the guy who was with Sam. How do you know Sam? Because I was the source... Soon the fireworks will begin. Get out of here now. this hotel will blow up soon. Who made you wear this!? Cat, we need to evacuate the building Let go of me! He's our only lead! Cat! If I don't do as she says, she'll kill my girl friend... Who is 'she'?!! May... May? Former specially appointed SSG officer We need to inform the hotel guests It's too late... Where can we find May? Tell us! Jump now, we're out of time Let go of me Hurry up, we don't have time Take your hands off, we need more leads There's no time now We haven't tried yet - Boom! - Madam! Come, we're all alive. Where there's life, there's hope Yes! May is the only lead now, you still see hope? You think it's ok to catch the bad guy and get everyone else killed? Catching the murderer saves lives, it's the big picture. We don't have a choice, San. As long as the boss is having fun? You're entitled to be cold blooded because your parents are rich? Babe, stop the car! What? Stop the car now! Fine! Madam's parents were killed at a bomb attack when she was 7. She swore to catch the terrorist. She's using her trust fund to recruit people. She doesn't want anyone to go through the same pain any more. Madam! Cat! San! Where are we, bro? Wakey-wakey The village's name is Lakunbatun. We need to fix the car and run away from the police, it's safer here. Look! Seems like a wedding there Where's Cat? Cat... Cat is... I'm fine Ready? Almost Almost done One second Look how happy they are! Babe told us about your parents... so you caught the killers yet? Caught recently. Brilliant Why were you fired by the Interpol? It's ok if you don't wanna tell me Yo and I followed a drug cartel for 6 months. When we found their hided out, I defied order for reinforcement and stormed in. We lost the informant. I was too greedy. Sorry for this morning, I shouldn't have said that. But if you kiss me without permission again, you're dead I won't kiss you even if you want to, don't worry Look! So high! We will take full responsibility to care for the patients. We will cooperate to the authorities and Interpol to the best of our ability, to apprehend the terrorist. It's getting worse now, what shall we do? A Hotel... why target on this particular hotel? Hotel A will undergo an extensive innovation to remedy its management and security system. How come... What's wrong? Hitler had the same face too, a lone wolf. It's not a time for jokes The reporter said it's committed by a mole? We should check this woman out You're blind guessing No. Old man is right this time, look There is something fishy May? She's the officer Dhupam mentioned? May is now the security manager of A Hotel Group What does she get from bombing the hotels? Only she knows Where is she now, Swan? Sources say the chairman will be in Jeju Island's A Hotel, May should be there too If they arrive tomorrow morning, we should be able to reach Jeju before them. Prepare the plane, Babe. Ok! Dig more about May, Swan. Madam, I have booked the suite opposite to Jeju Island's A Hotel So you are a Korean, teach me how to address you in Korean? Just call me "Oppa" (Honey) Oppa Oppa! Oppa! I'm sorry Oppa! Go away! I'm sorry! I'm ready, shall we jump? Wow! Boss you own a department store right? These are special weapons for combat. Be careful not to hurt yourself. This looks like a hairspray, but it's actually a time bomb. Set the time by turning the bottle. You take it back. You are petrified! These are tasers. We're bounty hunters, can't use guns. Mine is way better than yours. It's fully-charged Looks great, I'll use it when needed. That's a bullet proof jacket, double reinforced Kevlar fibre, can resist most bullets. And this is a rifle style taser, much more powerful than mine. Useful on a group target. The gun is so so, I like the jacket. Cat, May is not on the airline's passenger list. She's coming alone on A Hotel Group's ship. Babe and Swan, bug the chairman's room. Yo and San, come to pier with me. I can go with Swan It's ok, I've always done this kind of technical stuff with Babe, only he knows how to do it, right? Ok then! Don't pull that! Ok ok! - Don't touch it! - What? Take off his trousers! Take off your trousers! - Babe - What are you doing? - Hurry up Babe! - It's a bomb! - Bomb! - Let me help you! - Off! - No! Hurry! - Hurry! - Take it off! Stay down! Are you ok madam? Install in these spots. It should be fine Sorry, please, be careful! Stop looking! Reverse the car! Which way should we go? What if that container is full of explosives? Watch yourself, old madam! Ok! Ok! Is that preservative? Is it necessary to store them separately? Hey! Who are you? What's the matter? Isn't it Korean? Translate it! It's a dialect, I don't understand either Freeze! We're customs officers! Follow me. We've got work to do, brothers Ok! Try searching one Scare the shit out of me What are you doing up there Boss! We're family, Boss, there has to be another way It'll be very painful, come down No, please don't, really, I beg you! What the hell is going on? She's using taser! Boss! What did you say! Taser! What's your relation with May? You're bombing A Hotel Jeju? May ordered you to do this? It's May isn't it? When will you bomb it? What is May up to? What does she gain out of bombing the hotel? What does May gain out of bombing the hotel? Bro! I said the same thing! Why copy me? Really? I'm sorry, my brain is shocked by the bombing Why A Hotel? Save your breath, I won't tell you Babe! Babe! He's not back yet! What! Wait! Come! - Shut up! - Wait, you're Korean also? It's your last chance This is 10 times more power than the taser you tried just now You don't know what it's like to be tasered? Kills lots of brain cells Ok I'll tell you! I don't want to know now! Why! I said I'll tell you everything No need, I don't trust you, taser him! Taser coming! I'm gonna tase you now! Tommy Tommy! It's Tommy! It's all Tommy's idea Who's Tommy? Son of A Hotel Group's founder, used to be the successor. I'm sorry, Anyone there? Who are you! I'm Tommy Lock him up Hello! Nice meeting you. It's much more beautiful than I thought here! Ding dong! I just wonder who would make such a joke in the chairman's room. Turns out it's you lot Babe! Babe! - Babe! - Babe! It's ok, where's Swan? Your cute friend? She's fine, May! Swan Press and the bomb goes off You're behind all these? Yes Why blame it on us? You put the blame on yourselves. I just wanted the reporter to stay out of it, but you guys stood in my way. I could only blow off the ambulance. What a beautiful terrace! What a view, must be nice to watch the fireworks here! Anyway... Do you like fireworks? You need all the lights off for fireworks. It would be fabulous. This is a truth. What a shame! The night is too bright now. May, I've seen it before, I'll let you take care of here. You have one hour to surrender your guns and bring the bomb, or your friend will die. Release Yan Shen too. Where're the things? On the car. Where's Swan? Cat, come with me, alone. Where's Swan? I'm stuck at this level, do you know this game? Play with me, I'll bring you to watch fireworks. Cut the crap, let Swan go first Let's play something else then, come with me. I'm gonna break this level! If you win, I'll release her. The red pill is poisonous, can kills you in 10 mins. The blue one is the antidote. For the sake of explaining the rules, let's practice first. No! How many storeys are there? 15 storeys This is gonna be fun. Haha. 10 mins, the game begins He'll make Boss take the pills I'll rescue Cat, you'll take care of Swan Go! What are you doing? Lift! Lift! Take this and I'll give you the key. Your friend is in the car park. After 10 mins, I will press this remote control at the car park. Just like in the movies, bang! You know it well. In 10 mins will you get the antidote to save yourself, or save your friend. Your choice. Antidote! Get out of my way! Game starts! The antidote! Here! Antidote! Move away! Looking for this? May, today is the last time anyway. I wanted to follow the steps, but what now? Since you're here, show me what you can do. Let's see if she gets the antidote! What are you tasting, just swallow!

I'm sorry No problem, that's the fun We've got rid of them! Be cautious still I'm scared, Cat! Don't give up Lee San! Where are you? Look ahead We'll see what you've got! Crash them! Are you nuts? These hotels are your father's life! A Hotel Group Chairman, you business people only have eyes for money. What about your family? Who's nuts? Your father did everything for your sake! For my sake? He's always at the hotel on my birthdays. For my sake? When my mom died, he's in some ceremony at the hotel. For my sake? He left his fortune for you to manage when he's dead. Still hungry for money even when he's dead. I can give you back all the money and hotels, please just stop it! What a bore. You just don't get it. The thing I used to love most was watching fireworks with my parents. Tommy, I... Burn down this world corrupted by money and desire, then create a new world of love and peace. Madam, the necklace is off? No, unless all the battery inside is used up We've installed an electric wave barrier as remedy. It should block the remote control. Don't know if Lee San can come out in one piece. We should help What should we do now? First stop the bomb from going off, then get Tommy. Hack into the hotel's server, find out Tommy's next move. Ok Can't join the wifi network! Is it Tommy again? Madam, it's the wave barrier Then we can only use the cable. Cable? Thank god you came back safe! Come on in! What's the matter with you, since you lost contact Cat's been worried We've wasted some time, sorry about that OK! We'll clear our name then claim our reward. Yes Let's reorganise ourselves and take down the nutcase. Babe! Here's your room key. We're having a lantern festival tonight, please do join us. How long do you need, Swan? Just a second! It's so complicated with cable! Tommy would like it, but not his men. Neither do I Quiet, let's get started! Swan Yes! Set off the bomb now? Retreat! Look, piece of cake! Where's the bomb? That can't be all of the explosives! Tommy's not here either Let's find it What's going on! What's going on, Swan It's not the "go" sign yet, calm down. Go back to the suite.

They want to blow us all up too Throw it away! We can only set it off at the roof We have no choice but here What on earth is going on? Can you hear me? You are relentless! We need to black out the entire city for the perfect fireworks. The view is indeed the best here. You're gonna black out the entire island for the bombing, nutter? Why hasn't it gone off yet? Take off your ear piece guys. Wave barrier. Why's it not working? I hate this all! Tommy will guess we have a barrier, we must get him before he finds out. We'll remove the bomb first. You guys get Tommy What if you go and the bomb goes of at once? Who knows when it will blow up I have an idea. Go rescue Swan first. What's your idea You're my man! Let's go down, Babe Not even a goodbye and take care before leaving, you guys! Brother! Here I am! Sure you're not afraid to die? I'm not the only one! Let's move! Hurry up!

Cat! - Madam! - Babe! Madam, I'm fine! They've gone up! Victory is... playing fireworks game, you psycho? Shut up! What do you know? It's a present for my mom, watching the fireworks in despair with me! Stop it! Yo made it! Yo made it! Back off! The game's not over yet. What's the story here? Back off! I'll throw it down That's your final weapon. If you do it you'll die too I'm... really... Goodbye! Game over! Want a happy ending? Not so easy! A happy ending will come for sure. Lee San, get me the antidote! Oh ok! It's for Babe! Ok You took it? Spit it out! Save me, Oppa! Hurry up! Oppa, hurry up! Am I so easy? Why am I bullied again? When can I get my reward? Send it to my bank account tomorrow Why does Yo love money so much? Is he poor? Thought I mentioned? When he was at Interpol, he learned that kids who lost their parents in incidents were sent to the orphanage. He's been sending money to them from then on. Thank you, for saving me so many times. It's just lip service? Huh? That's my first kiss, Oppa! Whose order is it from? Animals' rights group Why send us to somewhere freezing cold? They say there'll be a $2 million reward Didn't I pay you salary? It's not good enough for you? 2 million? The plane ticket to the North Pole alone costs 1.5 million.
