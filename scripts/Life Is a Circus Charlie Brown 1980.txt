There's a circus in town... ...and they've closed our schooI so we can see it. I go to a progressive schooI, Chuck. They want us to experience all the good things in life. For your information, we also have been given the day off. Hey, that's great, Chuck. We'll meet you at the big top. That means the big tent, Chuck. The big show. I'll be there. [CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYING] One second, Chuck. I like to mix popcorn with my cotton candy. Here, Chuck, I'll give you half my popcorn. On second thought, Chuck... ...I don't think I want to mix my corn and candy. Bleh! [CHATTERING] MAN: And for your pleasure... ...ladies and gentlemen... ...the fabulous Miss Polly and her poodles. [UPBEAT CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYING] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] Hey, that's your dog, isn't it, Chuck? Ol, ol, beagle. Not bad, not bad, they really like us. Come on, beagle, they like you. Flip. Up, up, come up, up. Beagle, up, up, up, flip. Beagle, flip. How did he ever get into a circus act? Hop, hop, hop. I think it's beautifuI, Charles. Maybe Snoopy's found a career. It's a good direction in life for Snoopy. A career in the arts is something. But he doesn't need a career. His career is being my dog. [DRUMROLL] [GULPS] Hop, hop, hop. They love us, beagle. Up, up, up. Ol. Oop. [LAUGHING] Boy, pretty great, Chuck. Your dog is a circus clown. Imagine, Snoopy a circus star. I think he's pretty good. At least he's in show business. Show business? He's my dog. He should be home, guarding the house. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] Can you imagine that dog? A beagle in a poodle act? I wonder if he's coming home for dinner. I don't know, beagle. Maybe we'll have to use you as comedy relief. You were pretty clumsy. But with a little training, we can make you part of the act. Tomorrow we'll start your training, beagle. It's gonna take a lot of work. Once again, flip, flip, flip, flip. [PANTING] We'll just have to work at it, beagle. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PHONE] Yes, sir. He seems to have some talent. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes. Beagle, I just talked to the coloneI about you. And he thinks I should give you a try, but he says you need a new name. He says we should call you Hugo. Hugo the Great. From now on, when I call you Hugo, you'd better answer. And when the coloneI sees you, you'd better be great. Snoopy? Snoopy? Snoopy isn't back. I wonder if he stayed at that circus. Snoopy! Snoopy! Snoopy! Good grief, he's gone. Dognapped. [BELL RINGING] [TEETH CHATTERING] [YAWNS] [GRUNTING] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [SCREAMING] [PANTS] [YAWNS] [WHISTLE BLOWS] All right, everybody, rehearsaI time. We're gonna sharpen up our act and include Hugo. Hugo. Hugo the Great. Here, boy. Come, Hugo. Here, Hugo, you'll ride this. [YELPS] That's it, Hugo. Great. [GIBBERING] That's pretty good, Hugo. Now we'll try it on the wire. Okay, Hugo, ride the wheeI across and back. SNOOPY: Yipes! [YELPING] POLLY: Come on, Hugo, you can do it. Ride, Hugo. He just up and ran away. Joined the circus. Maybe he was bored... ...and needed a more exciting life, Charlie Brown. I don't wanna stand in his way... ...but after all, he got his food and lodging from me. I expected some loyalty. It's difficult not to be attracted by romance and excitement, Charlie Brown. Snoopy's now in the glamorous world of show biz. There's more to life than a plastic supper dish. [APPLAUDING] [UPBEAT CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [FANFARE PLAYING] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [UPBEAT CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PHONE] Yes, sir. I'll tell them. Uh-huh. Hm? The coloneI thought you were pretty good last night. But he thinks you can do even better. The coloneI says we need a trapeze act. [TEETH CHATTERING] Okay, Hugo, you catch. [YELPS] Okay, Hugo, now flip her back to the trapeze. This is a great act. We'll knock them dead. What do you think you'll do... ...if Snoopy doesn't come back from the circus? I haven't even thought about it. Sometimes I wonder why people love pets in the first place. People buy pets for strange reasons. How did you happen to get Snoopy, Charlie Brown? Well, I'm not quite sure because I was kind of young. I think it started because of something that happened at the playground. I was playing in the sandbox with a couple of other kids. I can't even remember who they were. Anyway, all of a sudden... ...one of them poured a whole bucket of sand all over my head. I started crying, I guess. And my mother came running up and took me home. It's kind of embarrassing now to talk about it. Anyway, the next day, we drove out to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm... ...and my mom and dad bought me a dog. You were right, Charlie Brown. People do buy pets for strange reasons. But what if Snoopy does stay with the circus? What if he doesn't come back? That's such a horrible thought, I can't even deaI with it. What in the world are you doing? Since Snoopy is obviously not coming back... ...we're closing down his house. What do you mean, he's not coming back? [CIRCUS MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PHONE] Yes, sir. Yes, sir, coloneI. We'll do anything you say, sir. Hugo and Fifi, I just spoke to ColoneI Stromp. He's the owner, you know. He says the act is great and now you two are stars. However, he thinks the act needs more color and class. He says your color scheme is all wrong. You know, the black ears and spots on white? All wrong. And as for you, Fifi... ...if you're gonna be Hugo's partner, you'll have to be color coordinated. The coloneI has decided to color you both pink. [GIBBERS] That's why I'm mixing this food coloring. Okay, Hugo. In you go. [YELPING] Now, then. [GROWLING] Hugo, let me at her. [SNARLING] Hugo, down, boy. Down, down, down, boy. [GASPS THEN YELPS] Hugo, Fifi, come back. Hugo the Great, Fifi, come back.
