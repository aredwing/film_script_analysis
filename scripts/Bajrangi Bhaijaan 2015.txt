Then the Pakistani police Will somehow or someway find Munni's parents, surely! Don't ever think like this! You'll rot in jail and nobody will know your whereabouts.

I've promised Bajarang Baali That I'd find her home. And that is what I will do There might be a way.. Television. TV? The story has no punch... What are you saying sir? An Indian.. Sneaks into Pakistan to help a mute girl reunite with her parents I think it's a wonderful story sir Your spy story had more punch - whatever happened to that..? ..but sir he's not even a spy! Then this talk is over! Bye. God bless Hello! Hello!? Sir but... What good is that story to us? Sir.. A child will be reunited with her parents - What else? Reunited with her parents? Listen.. We sell news..alright.. We are not Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah Temple Who unites separated people. Bye. Hate is easy to sell, sir But LOVE... What is Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah Temple? It's a famous shrine. It is said that wishes can come true. Why didn't we go there yet? Really.. You get sick of even the mention of mosques and shrines Remember that mosque.. You were running away as if you saw a ghost! I am prepared to go to any shrine for Munni! Let's go then and catch tonight's bus! It's ringing! It's ringing! Kamil! I was worried.. thank God.. Where are you? Is someone near you? Nobody is around me. Are you with the spy? He's not a spy man - He's quite a pure guy What do you mean? He's here to unite a little girl with her parents man Where are you now? We are leaving for Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah. It is said that it unites all missing people with those they love... Okay sir, okay - Take care of yourself! I'll see you later. You go in - I'll be coming along soon Where are you going? I'm Chand Nawab speaking And today I am going to tell you about such a man who came here without any visa.. And entered our land at night by crawling under the border fences and whose name is "Bajraangi" Just like the police, I too believed.. that he's an Indian spy.. But now - I know the truth he's NOT an Indian spy Then who is this man? ..then what is he? Why is he in our land? What does he want? He's a common man just like you and me.. And he's here because of just one and only one reason: Love. Compassion for a 6 year old speechless girl. Who got seperated from her parents in India. When all the doors were closed on Baajrangi slowly He only had this one way to find the girl's parents All the TV channels refused to air this story! They say the story is nonsense and a waste of their time That nobody is interested in this story So I plead you to help Bajrangi so that he can reunite this girl with her parents And also find himself safely back to his own home, and his own family in India Ring him. He's here with the police...come in quickly They are near. He's not answering. Answer the phone. What! Answer the phone. -Why? There's a plan. Hello brother Chand Nawab! Is everything alright?
