You can't understand a word | of the newspaper. At last. I always have to wait for you, Martha. My whole life I've been waiting for you | and your mother. -Nonsense, father. | -It's not nonsense. Then you're exaggerating. You always try to draw me | into a discussion... when you're in the wrong. -Forgive me, father. | -You say that to keep me quiet. Will you order the taxi? Yes, sir. At once. I sent the Libyan up to your room. | The one you winked at. Was that okay? -Who did I wink at? | -The dark guy. Yesterday. I've been in this business twenty years | and... I didn't wink at anyone. -It's not my nature. | -Sorry. I thought... Don't forget the taxi. Father, I want to write a card to mother. If you must. Mother, I'm fine. The weather's lovely. Rome is wonderful, | and father's so good to me... -Your taxi. | -Just the stamp. -Come on, Martha. | -But... Was it okay? What am I saying? I don't understand why they allow it | in a place like this. Yes, it's surprising. Come on. Do you feel unwell, father? | Is it too much for you? These damned steps are endless. Yes. They're very tiring. Lean on my arm, father. You always want to touch me, Martha. Father... Say something! Please, please. My God! Say something, father! Let go of me, Martha. My purse! It's been stolen. Mother! Keep quite calm now! I've some terrible news. | I just don't know... No, mother, it's... Father died today. He collapsed suddenly | on the Spanish Steps. No one could help him. Then my purse was stolen. | With all the money. Father didn't suffer at all. | Everything happened so fast. You mustn't cry, mother. He had such faith in God... so it's not so bad for him. That's why I'm at the German embassy... Because of the money. We must wrap the matter up, madam. | We close in ten minutes. Of course. Just ask your questions. | No mother. It's just... -Name? | -Martha Heyer. I have to answer a lot of questions. They're helping me. | I'm completely lost here. Father gave all the money to me. | He doesn't like having it on him. -Age? | -31. These last days he was so happy | and at peace with the world. He'd been wanting to see | St. Peter's for years. -Married? | -No. And he's always talking | of seeing the Pope. One shouldn't take it seriously. | He just enthused about it. -Full address? | -Constance. 21 Douglas Sirk Street. I was born and went to school | in Constance. I'm a librarian. I was always drawn to books. One thing at a time. | I have to write it all down. Of course. I'm just a bit upset. You understand the situation? Oh mother...don't cry! You know father doesn't like you crying. He never liked us crying, mother and I. Now I've hung up on her. | I didn't want to really. It just happened. I...couldn't help it. Help me! I just ran off and left father lying there. I had no idea what to do. Could you give me a cigarette? Thanks. Will you help me? Of course, we'll help you, Miss Heyer. I promised you that. Do you know, it's the first cigarette | I've ever smoked. Father forbade me to smoke. Would you be so kind | and dial mother's number again? I'm sorry. We were interrupted. Do you know... I'm smoking a cigarette? It's my very first one. The people are so nice to me here. They're going to help me bring | father's body back to Germany. -No, no... | -Mother! Come on, mother. Sit down here. What did you do, Martha, | to upset father so much? He was always upsetting himself over you. Sit down, Martha! Why can't you be like the others? | Father was always occupied with you. You took up all his energy. -Hello, Erna. | -Hello, Miss Heyer. Well, here I am again. Take a seat. It was rather quiet without you. Terrible about your father... What you must have been through. Such a cultivated man. What a shame. -Had he been unwell for some time? | -Yes... Father had a weak heart from childhood. Then it's easier to come to terms with. -Miss Heyer... | -Yes? You wanted to give me | an answer to my proposal. I've made up my mind | not to marry, Mr. Meister. Not yet, at least. You can imagine | how much mother needs me. Everything's so difficult... That's very sad for me, Miss Heyer. But I must accept your decision. Thank you. Did you manage on your own, Erna? Pretty well. It wasn't always easy | to find the trickier things. -Miss von Scratch? | -Yes? Would you come with me? He wants to marry me. You can't imagine how happy I am. | How good things will be. He's got such a lovely house, | and he's such a good man. Oh, Martha. Martha. Mother's her old self again. She wanted to see the doctor today. -It hit her harder than I thought. | -Of course. She phoned up half the town, | abusing people...including me. But she must have been pretty drunk. Drunk? I can't imagine that, Marianne. | Father never tolerated alcohol. I can't be sure. | She just gave that impression. Maybe she drank on the sly | and you never noticed. Mother? Maybe you're right. You've no idea what goes on | in some marriages. I always argued with Edgar | when I had a different opinion. -That's as it should be. | -On the contrary. I've learned to agree | with what my husband says, always. But when it comes to the crunch, | I get my way. And Edgar doesn't even notice it. But that's... Dishonest? Okay, so it's dishonest. But it's more peaceful, | and you need fewer tranquilizers. And... the divorce? Not acute anymore. So much has happened recently. | So much has changed. Who's that? Dr. Salomon. You must know him. -He's proposed to Ilse. | -And Ilse? She accepted, of course. | She'd be dumb not to. Hello, my dears. I can't stay. You'll have to excuse me. | Something's come up. -Meister asked me again to marry him. | -And? I... It's mother, you know. She needs me. You turned him down? Pretty dumb of you. He's a good catch. -He's marrying Erna now. | -Erna? Erna von Scratch, the girl I work with. That was inevitable, I suppose. Interesting. I didn't know it was so late. | I must be off. Edgar's waiting. He gets so impatient. See you some other time. Mother. Has our little madam come home at last? Sorry. I should have phoned. Get up! Since when do you drink? You never used to. Stupid bitch! | I've been drinking for 20 years. 20 years. Do you hear? You must eat something. Have you seen the doctor? That stupid idiot? He has no idea. I'm in good health, he says. Just my nerves, he says. | My nerves are on edge. No. The swine. -Mother. | -No one takes him seriously. -He prescribed Valium. | -There you are. He did prescribe something. I'm not taking orders from you! | Under any circumstances. What's this? That? My husband. -I can do what I like with it. | -Of course, mother. By the way, Meister asked me again | to marry him. -And? | -I said "no", of course. Stop laughing! Stop laughing at once! I'll laugh as long as I like. | I'll drink when I like... I'll do as I like, as I like... You're a horrible old spinster. | You revolt me. Who's talking of dying, | particularly at a wedding? One thinks of living, Mrs. Heyer, | of vitality, children... -Do you want to have children? | -Hans doesn't. Ilse! I never said I don't want children. I'm just afraid of raising them. Everything becomes such a problem | nowadays. I'm sorry, but children need love | and a firm hand, that's all. That's what I say. Adults just | have to pass on their experience... and not leave it all to the state. To quote Goethe: One could give birth to properly | brought up children... if the parents were properly brought up. Hear, hear. All this talk of freedom. | Life's not free. That's all very true | and we were all brought up strictly... and it didn't harm us. Nevertheless... No "nevertheless". | Don't be fooled by newfangled ideas. Moral laws are not a matter of fashion. You shake your head, Martha? | You disagree? Me? No, on the contrary. | I agree entirely. Dr. Salomon, your brother's arrived. -Hello, Helmut. | -Good evening. This is Ilse. My congratulations. Take a seat. That's Ilse's mother... Her father... Her friend Marianne... and her husband. Mr. Meister, | director of the state library, and his wife. And that's Dr. Hauff, our family doctor. And Mrs. Heyer, and her daughter Martha. Good evening all. We know each other, I think. Me? But... Oh yes. We know each other. No, I'm sure we don't... -But I'm quite certain, Mrs... | -Miss, if you please. We met in Rome, | outside the German embassy. Oh there? That's right. Why did you want to keep it a secret, | Martha? -That was mean of you. | -It's the truth. What will mother think? Mother's got such a dirty mind. She sees things biblically... if you know what I mean. -But you're a grown-up woman. | -No, I'm not. I mean... of course I'm grown up. But mother doesn't realize it, | or doesn't want to believe it. She's... a bit strange. She wasn't always like that. | Only since my father's death. I was struck by you in Rome. You had tears in your eyes. Father had just died... maybe a quarter of an hour before we met. -Halfway up the Spanish Steps he... | -You aroused my feelings then. I haven't forgotten you since either. I didn't say I hadn't forgotten you. You... But maybe that is the case. | Maybe I haven't forgotten you. Yes, maybe. -You've never slept with a man? | -How dare you! Am I right? Yes... you're right. And you think you're beautiful... attractive and charming? Yes, a little. I don't think you're very beautiful... and certainly not attractive and charming. You're too thin, almost skinny. When one looks at you, | one can almost feel your bones. And I have the impression your body smells. Mother! I must go back inside. For heaven's sake, doctor! | What's the matter with mother? Nothing serious. | No need to alarm yourself. Your mother took too many tranquilizers | by mistake. Give me a hand. Prepare some hot milk. Olga! -Yes? | -Bring a glass of hot milk! -Milk, milk, milk! | -Right away. Thank you. You can go now. | It won't be a pleasant sight. Is the milk being warmed? What have you done to your mother, | Martha, to make her want to die? Keep an eye on her. I'll be right back. | And warm the milk. Mama, what have you been up to? It's no joke, you know. You want to kill me, Martha. -Good morning, Miss Heyer. | -Good morning. That's her. Come here a moment. I'd like to introduce Mr. Kaiser. He'll be taking over the duties of my wife. I described you to him in glowing terms... and promised him you'd show him the ropes. -You will, won't you? | -With pleasure. -I knew it. | -Thank you. Don't mention it. Even so, when one | begins a new stage in one's life... I know what you mean. Come with me. -What do you like most in life? | -I don't know. -Fate? | -What? Fate? Why? Do you find that strange? I don't know. Is it because of despair? Let's talk about something more cheerful. Do you know: What thinks the mouse on Thursday? No. It goes like this: What thinks the mouse on Thursday, | on Thursday, on Thursday? It thinks the same as every day, | as every day, as every day... Oh how I'd love some ham on bread, | some ham on bread, some ham on bread! With lots of ham and not much bread. -Isn't that nice? | -Yes. Let's say it together. What thinks the mouse on Thursday? It thinks the same as every day... Oh how I'd love some ham on bread! Who was that? That? The man I'm going to marry. -Well, will you? | -It'll make me sick. -I'm really afraid. | -But Martha, I'll be with you. -That's all very well, but... | -What then? Fear is there to be overcome. Martha... I want you to be my wife. I want to marry you. Thank you, Helmut. Thank you, thank you. You've no idea how I've yearned | to hear these words. Won't you take a seat? -Thanks. I prefer to stand. | -As you wish. Something to drink? A cognac? | I've got French cognac. Helmut Salomon's asked me to be his wife. And I've accepted. | I'm going to marry Helmut. No you're not, Martha. Not as long as I'm alive, you won't. Yes, I shall, mother. Very well, if that's what you want. Have it your way. -Where are you going? | -I must phone Dr. Hauff. -Why? | -Mother will die if I don't. Oh Helmut... I understand what you want to say. You mean, she has a right to die. That's what you meant? Never do that again, Martha. Never resist me | when I want to make love to you. Dr. Hauff? Helmut Salomon here. Come quickly. Mrs. Heyer's taken an overdose | of tablets again. I think we can't avoid putting her | in a psychiatric clinic. Thank you. Well, Martha... Did you really believe | I'd let your mother die? No... That was just your imagination... and your wish, too, no doubt. It's so lovely being alone with you. All those people. It was a lovely wedding, I know... Everyone was so nice to me, | even mother. One hardly noticed the medical attendants. Mother's in good hands now, isn't she? She seemed so cheerful, so open. Everyone genuinely wished me happiness. Oh Helmut! | To think I'd live to see this day! And now...alone with you. We'll have three wonderful weeks. You've no idea how much | I'm looking forward to Italy... to every grain of sand, every wave... I'll be so good to you, so tender. My God, I've so much tenderness | to give you. All my desire. I'm so happy. I could cry for joy. But you... You're so serious, so quiet. Aren't you looking forward? | Aren't you happy? Of course I'm happy. I don't have to convince myself though. I'm sorry. My God, how lovely it is here. You couldn't see anything by night. | The view... I could drink a whole pot of coffee | and eat ten eggs. I've ordered tea. It's healthier. | And cornflakes. -Oh...you ordered tea? | -And cornflakes. Yes, cornflakes. Of course. -That's all right with you, my dear? | -Oh yes, of course. Martha, not before breakfast. It's good that someone watches my health. How easily one forgets oneself. Yes, Martha, that's true. The worst thing when one's traveling... is that one has to put up | with local customs. In South America, for example, | there's no tea with breakfast. One's compelled to drink coffee. | How I've suffered. Every morning: coffee... for nine months. | And the food in general! But one has to eat... and one gets used to everything. My God, yes. | We've never talked about food. What's your favorite dish? My favorite dish? That's not so easy. Pig's kidneys in Burgundy sauce, I'd say. Pig's kidneys? My God, just like father! But one has to avoid things like that | in southern climes. One never knows what one's really getting. Poor thing! | I hope your long journey will soon be over. In the next few years I'll be in Germany, | Switzerland and Austria. I can get home every weekend. Would you mind creaming me? -Martha, you've got such white skin... | -Yes? I'd like you to get brown quickly. All this white skin. What if I get sunburned? Ah, the sun's not really strong here. All right. | If you want me to get brown... What are you reading? Professor Hans Kilian's | The Dispossessed Consciousness. Is it interesting? That depends. If one understands the subject, | it's interesting. Ilse's given up her job. That's sensible. If a man can support his wife, | it's embarrassing if she works. That may be true of Ilse. She hated her work. But if a woman loves her work... it can be something wonderful. Still no better? You fell asleep, Martha. You mustn't sleep in the sun. The body has no resistance then. You are beautiful, Martha. Am I? Helmut...aren't we going home? -Of course we are. | -But...this is the wrong direction. We live over there, in my parents' house. We're not going to live there. | I've rented a house... Colonel Olbricht's house. But Helmut... | a murder was committed in that house. That's why it was cheaper. You're not afraid, Martha? No, it's just that... I was used to my parents' house. My whole childhood... | All those memories... I was happy in that house. And now... And now? That's precisely the point, Martha. We want to make a new start, | a completely new life... Don't we? I wanted to ask you a favor. Here, in the house... you know I can't stand smoking. If you want to smoke, | do it on the verandah. To please me, hmm? Where is the verandah? Please. Maybe I could... What? Maybe I could have... my own furniture? But Martha... | the style wouldn't fit here. You'll get used to it. You shouldn't be so sad. I, a whole week without you. I'll be back on Friday. I'll be thinking of you all the time. Maybe your ears will burn. Good morning. Hello, Mrs. Salomon. I said, "Good morning." All right, I'll say it again: Good morning. What are you doing here? What am I doing? I don't understand... Your husband handed in your resignation | long ago. -My job? | -Yes. Oh, that's... that's right. My God, I... I just wanted to borrow a book. | That's right. Of course. Make yourself at home. | Drop in any time. Hello, can I speak to Mrs. Ilse Salomon? Oh...they're on vacation? When do you expect them back? In two weeks. Can't be helped, then. Thanks all the same. Aren't you a bit too old | for a hairstyle like that? Don't cry, please. I was so looking forward to seeing you. You did it for me, didn't you? If I find your hairstyle funny... I know that you meant well. Laugh now, come on. What have you been up to | the whole week, my dear? Nothing much. I tried to read a book. | But the story wasn't interesting. -Helmut? | -Yes? -Why didn't you tell me? | -What? The business of my resignation. What business? You mean your job? We settled that long ago. I made it quite clear, | I didn't want my wife to work. You hadn't forgotten? -Come with me. | -Where? -Where do you think? | -Now? Dinner's ready and... it's not dark yet. I'm sorry, Martha. I hurt you. Try to understand, | it's because I love you so much. I've been yearning for you all week. When I hold you in my arms | I don't know what I'm doing. That should tell you how much I love you. Martha? Are you still angry with me? No, Helmut, no. I'm not angry with you. Now I know. For a moment... I was so frightened. Oh, Helmut, forgive me. Yes, Martha. I forgive you. Come on now. I need you. -By the way, Martha. | -Yes? I bought you a present. A record. That's good of you. Thank you. Do you listen to this dreadful music? What? Donizetti, Lucia di Lammermoor. Yes. I like it very much. But Martha, that's not music. It's... Slime. Pure slime. I don't understand anything about music. I just like to listen to it... This is music. This is what you must listen to. Orlando di Lasso. Yes, probably. Of course. But... I must get back to the kitchen...dinner. That's what you must listen to, | over and over again... -Until you understand what it is. | -Yes, Helmut. I'll try. -What's this? | -That? Pig's kidneys. Pig's kidneys in Burgundy sauce. I took great trouble... I'm sorry, Martha. | Did you forget I'm allergic to offal? I have been for years. Always. No, Helmut. That's your favorite dish. Pig's kidneys in Burgundy sauce. There's no need to cry. No need at all. I see that you meant well. Yes, you can see that. Of course, my darling. Of course I see it. You're just a bit confused. | You're mixing things up. Don't worry about it. It'll pass. Did your father like pig's kidneys? Just think! Father? Yes, it was father's favorite dish. There you are. We've cleared it up. Let's go in the kitchen | and cook something quickly... For me, anything will do. Here's a book about dam engineering | for you to read. You've a whole week to read it. I want you to understand my work | so that I can talk with you. For the vibro-compaction... necessary for high-grade concrete... the water-cement factor... should not exceed 0.45. Hello, Marianne. Martha here. I've been trying to reach you | for over a week. Yes, fine. At three? Okay, see you then. How do you like married life? It's all so...new for me. And not as great | as you thought it would be? I always told you... not to have such high hopes. But... you know... it isn't as you described it either. How is it then? Hard to say. It's just so different. You've got one of the most attractive men | I know. You think so? But...he's... a bit strange. What do you mean, "strange"? | He loves you? Oh yes. He loves me beyond all bounds. And yet he still seems very strange. Just you wait. | One day he'll seem very ordinary to you. You think so? Yes, that would be lovely. It would be quite wonderful. What's so strange about your husband? I can't think of anything when you ask. I don't want to say he frightens me, | but... sometimes I'm almost afraid. You're afraid? Why? I can't describe it. It's more a feeling, an intuition. What does he do? Does he beat you? How can you ask such a thing? | Of course he doesn't. He's...really...quite...normal. But... I don't know. I can never think of the right expression. Maybe everything's really too new. -Are you unhappy? | -No, Marianne... Not in the least. | I'm very happy, naturally. It's just that... when he makes love... he's so... severe. -Severe? | -Not severe in the sense of severe. He's so violent. -Violent? | -No, not violent. -He just kisses me so hard. | -Where? Oh, he's unrestrained in his love making. | Is that it? Yes, that's what he is... Unrestrained. Hello, Mrs. Salomon. I happened to see you. I live near here. I must be going. Goodbye. Maybe I could walk with you a bit? I've been wanting to ask you something. Why did your husband do that? -With your job, I mean. | -What did my husband do? He quit your job for you | without your knowledge. That's the truth of the matter. No, Mr. Kaiser, that's not the truth at all. And anyway, it's my business entirely. Good day! Donizetti again? Didn't you like the music I gave you? Yes, but... | I couldn't listen to the same music all week. Did you listen to it at all? No, Helmut, I... I don't like that kind of music. Did you read the book | about civil engineering? To be quite honest, I... I haven't even started it. It simply didn't interest me. For the vibro-compaction... necessary for high-grade concrete... the WCF should not exceed 0.45. Hello, Martha here. | Sorry to bother you, but is... Is Helmut there? He was, but he left hours ago... I've read the book. | He's really not there? We could talk now. | I've listened to the music, too. It's lovely. He's really not there? No... I'm just a bit on edge... and I don't have any more tranquilizers. I flushed them down the toilet... some time ago. I just thought he might go to his brother. But if he's not there... Yes, good night. Martha Salomon, nee Heyer... on a Monday, September 23. Hello? Martha Salomon here. Mr. Kaiser? I wanted to apologize | for being so rude recently. It was because... I've been so nervous recently, and... so lonely. I haven't heard from my husband for days. I just have to speak to someone | or I'll go crazy. Would you care to meet me? Oh yes. Two o'clock. Thank you. Helmut? Helmut! Helmut! Is this the Salomon house? I...mixed you up with someone else. | Yes, we're the Salomons. -Can...Can I help you? | -I'm from the Post Office, ma'am. I've come to disconnect your phone, | as requested. The phone. No, no! Impossible. We don't want it disconnected. Here's the application, signed by your | husband: "urgent" underlined. Yes, that's...correct. I didn't think you'd come so quickly. It's there, in the corner. What happened? Did you quarrel? No...It's just... I didn't read his book. | But I've read it now. I can quote whole passages, | all those in bold print. -What book was it you hadn't read? | -It's not important. He's got such rigid principles. | On the other hand, that's good. Where would we be without principles? But to quarrel like that over a book? Quarrel? There was no quarrel. Suddenly everything was so grey. Do you remember: What thinks the mouse on Thursday? Oh yes... I remember. It thinks the same as every day... You mustn't be unhappy, Martha. | You don't deserve to be. Helmut. You? What are you doing here? I don't know what you mean. | I don't know you. But you... disconnected our telephone today. I'm sorry, you must be mixing me up | with someone else. Was that your husband? I don't know. -Hello, Martha. | -Hello, Helmut. -How are you? | -Quite well...now. Would you like a cup of tea? Very much. Then I'll bring you a cup of tea. Orlando di Lasso? Thank you, Martha. Did you like the book? Oh yes. Most interesting. For the vibro-compaction... necessary for high-grade concrete... the WCF should not exceed 0.45. Water-cement factors between 0.38... and 0.4 are optimal. These and lower factors | can be achieved... with the aid of additives. The surface tension of the water | is thus reduced... and therewith its coating capacity. When choosing aggregate... it is sufficient | if the strength is twice that... of the concrete to be produced. Clean aggregate is a precondition | for a good mix. You see, these things can be fun. I love you, Martha...boundlessly. Martha, my dear little thing. Don't cry. I'm here with you. Look at me. I've been thinking... You could do something wonderful for me. It would be a tremendous token | of your love for me. Yes, Helmut. Tell me. I ask you not to go out of the house | anymore. I want you to be here for me alone. The whole week at work, when I think... The very notion that you could be unfaithful... I couldn't bear that. It would be the end of me, Martha. | It would be my death. How can you even think it? Silly thing. How could you imagine I'd deceive you? I'd never...never do such a thing. You see. I knew it. And that's when I thought... the best thing would be | not to put temptation in your way. Will you? That's good, Martha, very good. -Helmut? | -Yes? Could we perhaps have a child? No, Martha, I'm sorry. Think of your mother. She's very sick. Or do you want to give birth | to a demented child? Come on. What's this? Oh that... A cat. I've called it Rubel, | because it's so black. I didn't think you'd mind. It's only an animal, and... And? I longed to have a living creature... when I was here the whole week alone, | and so I... You won't forbid it, will you? Say you'll allow me to keep Rubel. But of course, my darling, | if it means so much to you. I knew it. Thank you, thank you so much. -I'm hungry, Martha. | -Of course. I'm nearly finished. Rubel? My little Rubel! He's dead! What's the matter? My cat's dead. Rubel's dead. And yesterday the cat was dead. A cat doesn't die just like that. | It was still young. The strangest things can happen | with animals. And this? Stop it. People are looking. -Did he do it? | -Yes. He always hurts me, when he makes love. He grows more and more abandoned. | I'm afraid. You must be careful, Martha. | Your husband's... a sadist. That's not true! It's a lie! You're mean and nasty. You've got a dirty mind. | You want to ruin my marriage. You know where to find me if you need me. You've been out, Martha. You promised me not to leave the house. But...that... that's... No need to stutter. No harm done, is there? No, no...of course not. Of course there was no harm done. There you are. I'll have a bath now. My car broke down... and I desire you so much. By the way, I've brought you a present. I want you to be especially loving | to me today. It's upstairs on the bed. He brought me a present! He brought... My God, I have to be especially loving... He wants to kill me! What's the matter with you, Martha? You've got to help me! | He wants to kill me. He brought me a present. | He wants to kill me. Please come! Okay...we'll go for a drive. I'll get the car keys. What's up? Pull yourself together! He's following us. He said his car had broken down. Drive faster! My God, he's drawing nearer. Faster! He's coming! Don't slow down! | Don't let him catch me! Where am I? In the hospital, Martha. The hospital? And why? You had an accident... in the car of a certain Mr. Kaiser. Did anything happen... to him? Mr. Kaiser's dead. My God! It's all my fault. And what about me? You can tell me the truth. I can take it. You're paralyzed for life. My God! I'll manage. | I can still work with my hands. I'll manage. But Martha, you've got Helmut. He's not a person to leave others | in the lurch. He was sitting the whole time | by your bed. He loves you. No, no! Help me! Mama, mama, mama! Come in. A visitor for you. Yes. -Martha, Helmut's here. | -Let her be. She has to come to terms | with her new life. Give her time. Martha... my dearest. You can take her home soon. | She's doing well. That's good. I felt so alone at home. Mrs. Salomon, you're going home. | Aren't you pleased? Yes, nurse, of course I'm pleased. Chin up, Martha, | and make a complete recovery! Complete? When God makes a decision, | man can't change it. Goodbye. Take care, old boy. -Goodbye, Mr. Salomon. | -I've got something for you. Thank you.
