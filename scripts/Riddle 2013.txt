You're messing up his hair. Ah, it's good for him. Make him look like Eddie Van Halen. We are going to be late. Have a good day at school. Bye. Love you two. Be careful. Hey. Your lunch. So, where are you taking me this weekend? We'll see. Hmm. Oh, man. Come here. Oh, God. You're an idiot. Nathan. Hey. Don't forget to meet me after practice. Okay. Open your textbooks to page 207. I take it everyone did the reading last night. How's it going? The Civil War. Key battles. Can anybody tell me the significance of the date July 21, 1861? Matthew Caldwell. Uh, it was the first battle of Bull Run. That's correct. But can you tell me who won? Well, it was a real mess. But Colonel Thomas J. Jackson got the credit and his nickname Stonewall for rallying Johnny Reb and driving the Union back to D.C. Very good. But reports of the battle were not without controversy. Since the Confederacy captured the Union supply depot at Manassas Junction... Death from above. You know I hate you, right? No, I mean, just... I just want to let you know. How do you eat that garbage? You mean this? Okay. All right. I'm out of here. Hey, Lendie. Check this out. Shit. So, who's the dead man? Hey, Matt. Check this out. It costs four rubies for a Dwarf spell. That was mine. What'd you say? Cam. Cam. You two. What? We're just messing around. Detention. Hey! Let's go, Colts! Whoo! Let's go, Colts! Let's go, Colts! Team, let's go! Dude, do you think that maybe someday we can get out of school at the same time as everyone else? Look at that. It's that little weasel. Come on. Let's go, Colts! Let's go, Colts! Let's go, Colts! Let's go, Colts! Let's go, Colts! What's up, Chief? Well, I can see why you like to sit here. I mean, suddenly, I just got some more school spirit. Jess, what's up? You see those Riddle boys talking to your brother? He's fine. All right, girls, let's go again. It's Nathan, right? Yeah. Hey, you a motor-head? Got a '73 Plymouth 'Cuda, dual exhaust, V8. Hell, yeah! He's not joking, dude. It's a beauty. Hey, you want to see it? I... I can't. I... I have to wait for my sister. Come on. He doesn't show just anybody. # Our ship is burning Whoo-hoo! # And as she slides into the darkened sea # # I'm haunted by this melody... # Ready? Okay. Let's get down, let's get mean. Come on, Colts, let's beat that team! Let's get down, let's get mean. Come on, Colts, let's beat that team! Let's get down, let's get mean. Come on, Colts, let's beat that team! When are you gonna take me back? You like chicken? Quit playing around, man. Come on. Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! Oh, yeah! Whoo! Ha ha. You all right, kid? That wasn't cool, man. Stop being a little girl. I didn't scare you, did I? Son of a bitch! He pissed himself. On the new seat covers. Dude, get out. Get out. Out of the car, man. Heh. Dude, there's a bathroom by the garage. Why don't you get cleaned up, all right? See if you can get some beers. # I'd find someone like you # # The kind of dream # I've always held on to # I'll get the kid. Maybe he fell in. Hey, buddy? You ready? You in here? Where's Nathan? I don't know. Please be okay. Hey, Hols. What do you think? Heh. Very cute. Do you have to leave today? I really just want to get back. My folks are in Palm Springs. I've got the house to myself for a couple days. Stay. Come to the party with us. I really can't. I promised I'd work at the farmers' market. I'll be back in a week. We can do something then. Yeah, you always say that, but you'll just end up burying your nose in another textbook. Have a drink for me. You like that one? Sir, your change. Thank you. Have a good day. Hey. Is that all for you? Yeah. You've been a huge help today, Holly. Oh, are you kidding? I love the market. Well, I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. It's a madhouse today. Oh. Sorry. Oh, dear. Are you okay? Yeah, can you cover for me for a minute? Nathan? Excuse me, sir? Did somebody just buy firewood from you? Plenty have, all day long. He had a beard, a dirty jacket, beat-up old shoes? Oh, yeah. He don't buy wood, he sells it to me. We just do a little business round this time of year. What's his name? Well, he never said. He don't say much. I think he gets his stock over in Riddle. They got plenty of hardwood out there. Why do you ask? Are you okay, sweetie? Yeah. Everything's fine. Uh, but I have to go. I'm really sorry. ...and the Beast that was and is nigh, even is the eighth and is of the seventh and goeth into perdi... Hey! Hey there. No, don't be afraid! Excuse me, sir? Can you tell me where the police station is? Sir? Excuse me. Excuse me. I really need to speak to the sheriff. What's the name? Holly Teller. He's in a meeting. Take a seat. Could I use your phone? I suppose. Hey, this is Dave Teller. I'm not available to take your call right now, but if you leave a message, I'll get back to you as soon I can. Thank you. Amber. Oh, God. It's my body. Why do you care? Well, you might as well paint a bull's-eye on your ass. God, give it a rest, Dad. Bill. Look who's here. Sheriff Richards. I'm Holly Teller, Nathan Teller's sister. What can I do for you? I saw my brother. He's alive, and I think he's here in Riddle. Let's slow down a minute. You saw your brother? Here in Riddle? Not here. Back in Jefferson, and I'm not positive... You're not positive. But I think they were headed here. You're not positive. Well, I saw a man in a truck. Nathan was riding with him. Ms. Teller, when family members suffer a loss, it can be very difficult. I'm not making this up. All right, let's talk in my office. Have a seat. Now, unless there's any new evidence, then the case is closed. But I told you, I... I saw him. Well, lots of people saw him or claimed that they saw him. That's the problem. Nothing ever happens. Let me give you some advice. Why don't you go back to Jefferson and tell the people there what you think you saw? Because he's not in Jefferson. He's here. You're just refusing to believe me. When your little brother went missing, it was as if this entire town was put on trial. The FBI, state troopers, everyone came in like the Knights Templar. Everyone knew best. He's a missing child. How could you turn your back to that? You're just another outsider coming in on your white horse, making demands. We've done all that we could do. So that's it? Sometimes your problems are your own. No, it's semiautomatic. Come on. Let me just hold it. Now, you know I can't do that. Mmm. Are you sure about that? Look, I gotta get back, all right? All right, then. You're Holly Teller. We went to school together. I know who you are. So, uh, what are you doing here in Riddle? I was hoping to get help from the Sheriff. From my dad? Yeah, he's anything but helpful. Is, uh, this about your brother? Yeah. Come on. Bill... this gonna be a problem? Don't you worry about it. This doesn't concern you. Mm-hmm. These past few years must have been pretty hard on you. Doesn't help that everybody wants to forget. My parents have been really strong, but... even they're starting to give up hope. Yeah, well, at least you still have your parents. My dad and I... have a terrible relationship. I was kind of counting on him to show a little bit more compassion. Yeah. Ha ha ha. Well, don't take it personally. He's, uh, not really one for foreigners. No, he thinks anybody who comes here is some kind of... threat to his little world. You know, my grandmother used to show me these pictures. Before that hospital closed down, this place really wasn't that bad. I mean, there was a hotel and a bank. Amber, I came here for a reason, and it wasn't to give your father a hard time. But he was the sheriff when my brother disappeared. That didn't happen here. Those boys... they were from here. Holly, they just went for a ride. That's it. Nobody knows what happened after that. I know. That's not what I meant. I... I need a drink. # Gotta spread the money blues... # Amber, hold on. There's something I need to explain. Relax. Sam? Two beers. Got it. I can't relax. Sure you can. Have a beer. You don't understand. I saw my brother today. What? At the farmers' market back in Jefferson. This guy had him in his pickup truck. Before I had a chance to get to them, they drove off. I think the guy lives in Riddle. That's why I came here. Are you sure it was him? I couldn't get that close of a look, but... I know my brother. It had to be him. That's why you were talking to my dad. But why would... There must be something he's not telling you. What are you saying? I'll be right back. Get lost, wench. Look who's here. # You know that beggars can't choose # # Gotta spread the money... # You're that girl, aren't you? The one whose brother went missing? # Beggars can't choose # Gotta spread the money blues # I'm sorry. I should keep my stupid mouth shut. I didn't mean any harm. It's okay. Wait. What do you know about it? I can't talk about this right now. Sam! Another round. Yeah, yeah. Keep your hat on. Holly. What are you doing? I don't want to talk to him. Hi, Holly. Don't worry. He's here to help. We're in. Found it. "Myotonia Congenita. Thompson's Disease." Does that mean anything to you? We've known about Nathan having Thompson's since he was little. "Name of child, Nathan Bristol." "Place of birth, Riddle, Pennsylvania." Birth parents, Gene and Sandra Bristol. "Known siblings, Holly Bristol." You were adopted? Riddle psychiatric files? Oh. Hold on. Bristol. Bristol. Bristol. "January 17, 1989, "Gene Bristol was arrested by authorities "at 7:31 in the morning after a neighbor reported a disturbance at the residence." "He had taken the life of Sandra Bristol, stabbing her 13 times in the chest and back." Oh, God. It says, "Gene Bristol, pronounced unfit to stand trial, "has been committed to Riddle Psychiatric Hospital on this day of March 15, 1989." We gotta get out of here. Let's go. # The chip inside my mind # The one behind my eyes... # Hey. Anything left to drink? Um... whiskey. # Of a shrine # Pulsing in the head # I don't even sleep anymore # # A NASA weather vane # Transmissions from outer space # # Weird skies at night... Dude, what's she doing here? You're not gonna believe this shit. Hey. # I don't even sleep any more... # You know, their lives changed a lot that day, too. # Transmissions from outer space... # I know. I know. I just wasn't expecting all this. I just want to find my brother. What else does it say? "Gene Bristol, declared dead along with 43 others, September 3, 1989." That was the night of the fire. The hospital became a place for the criminally insane... but not everyone in town approved. Okay, boys. Let's fire it up. There were questions of security and rumors of patient abuse. When a local nurse was killed... chaos broke out within the walls. The asylum was put on lockdown. It's the way it has to be. That's when the fire started. It could have been the prisoners. Some think it was hospital administrators. Others blamed a group of kids. Many were burned alive. It's not all peachy keen and white picket fences, like in Jefferson. Well, actually, Holly was born here in Riddle. That makes you one of us. One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us. Okay, let's go ahead and, uh... This one. Yes, Doctor. Great. Thanks. Check this out. Aww. Hey there, sleepyhead. What's that? "Holly, meet me at the quarry in an hour. "It's about your brother. Come alone. Sam." Did you talk to Sam? Yeah, when you left me at the bar. Oh. All right, I'm gonna go get the boys. No, wait. I'm not gonna let you go up there by yourself. Please. This could be my only chance. Can you tell me how to get there? Wait. What exactly did she say? She just said she had to take care of something. That my daughter? Did she at least say where she was going? Could you stop asking me a million questions? You guys starting early? Sam? Glad you could make it. Who are you? Where's Sam? I'm the man you want to talk to. You're not gonna find your brother. What do you know about Nathan? You know, there's a lot you don't know about our little town. You've been snooping around where you don't belong. Look, I saw my brother. I saw him. I know he's here. We don't share our secrets. Where is he? You don't understand, do you, sweetheart? Don't touch me. Hey! Hey! No! No! Please! Please! No! No! No. No. You made a big mistake coming here. No! Get off of me. No! Are you okay? Oh, look out! It's Jack Abel. What was he doing here? Wouldn't expect him to do something like this. What did you do? He was gonna tell me something. I know it. Holly... what is wrong with you? He knew something about Nathan. He was gonna hurt you... and now he's dead! Calm down. All right, look, it was an accident. What was I supposed to do? We have to tell the sheriff. No. Look, we can't do that. They'll... They'll never believe us. The guy's dead, Cam. We kind of have to report it. There's no way in hell the town's gonna understand. They'll protect him. And besides, Amber's dad has been gunning for us since we were kids. Cam is right. It was just a mistake, especially with Holly being here. Wait. Holly. This has gotten way out of hand. Nathan's gone, isn't he? I'm not sure. I don't know what I'm doing here anymore. I need to go home. You kids been getting into trouble? Amber, get in the car. And you, darlin', I think you've overstayed your welcome. Amber, I said get in the car. Hey, look, you don't have to listen to him. Don't even try it. Put that shotgun down. All right, this charade is over. I don't want to see the four of you together again. Hey. Hey, I want you to know that we really liked your brother. And I'm sorry. Cam and I, we were immature, and we... we didn't mean for any of this to happen. It's okay. I understand. Holly, Hal will get you up and running in no time. All right, kids. Get her back to my place. What, you're not gonna tow it? It's a block away. Push. So... how's the college life? It's different, that's for sure. Yeah. It's definitely not for me. You must have wanted to leave here at some point. Why would I want to live anywhere else? People don't care what you do here. We just party, and we can do whatever we want. Plus, you know, what would these two do without me? Foreign cars, that's my specialty. Yeah, I've seen radiators like this. Might even have one of these fancies lying around here. Hey, Cam, it's your old coupe. Hey, put that back. That's Veronica. Heh heh. Nothing wrong with naming your car after a girl. Yeah. Sport, did you hear what I said? Oh, yeah. Veronica. What about this one? '86 Silverado. That numskull, always chewing up his tires. Can you tell me where I might find the owner? Well, I can't say. We don't, uh, talk about other folks like that around here. No, no. We're gonna talk about it. How long have we been walking? I cannot feel my feet. I don't even know what we're looking for. The mechanic said he drives on these tracks. There's gotta be something. Well, I mean, look, we've been out here for hours. It's gonna be dark soon. Yeah, we'll come back. Hey, guys! Down here! I think I found something. Look. Tire tracks. This has to be it. Wow. I didn't know this was up here. Holly, hang with me. Come on. Look at this place. Home, sweet home. Come on. Keep a lookout. Whistle if you see anything. Cam? Hello. Stay close. Matt! Over here. Won't budge. No shit. Hang in there, buddy. Hey, guys, I found him. Nathan? He's locked in the pen. Nathan? I'm going to get Amber. Yeah. Nathan. What are you... Nathan. Oh, my God. It's locked. Can you pick it? Yeah, yeah, I think so. Um... No. I'll check it out. We have to get out. I'm not leaving Nathan. Holly. Holly, he's back. I'm not leaving. No, it's just a matter of time before he comes in here, okay? Don't worry. I will get Nathan out. Come on. Come on. Come on! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no. We'll be right behind you, okay? Be careful. Go. What, you want to get rough, old man? Come on. Let's go. No! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No! H- Help me! Help me! Help! You're late, pretty boy. Just making the rounds. No Jack Abel tonight? Looks that way. What are you in for? How 'bout 20? No! Holly! Holly... your brother stays with me. You... belong with your mother. Yaah! Oh, my God. No. Help me! Somebody help me. Please, what are you doing? Please, wait. Please just let me go. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Ow. Ow. No. Nurse... prepare the conductor. Two ladies. I'm calling it a night. Luck's not running your way, huh, boss? Just rags tonight. Clark! Jersey, get an ambulance out here. We learn through pain. Okay. On my mark. Okay. Oh, God. It's okay. It's okay. She wasn't lying. She wasn't lying. Sandra? Oh, hey. Hey. I'm here now. Hey. I thought I'd lost you. Nathan? Nathan? Nathan, please say something. Hey. Hey, hey. I'm here. I have you now. This is Clark. We're at the compound now. Jersey and Bobby are searching the grounds. They found the Teller boy. God damn. Sheriff Richards! Can you comment on the incident? Sheriff? Let's give him some room. All right? Back up. There'll be plenty of time for answering questions later, all right? Hey. You okay? I want you to meet someone. Thank you. All right, here we go. Ms. Teller. I need to know what happened up there. Well, Sheriff... sometimes your problems are your own. Oh, my God. My baby. Oh. Oh, my God. Come here.
