The master will deal with it. Huiwu yes, in the temple only you can use the diamond blood palm. Mr Shi died in our temple which is very serious. as a master of this temple I have responsibility to make clear. Jingchen, Jingxu yes throw him into the Huixin room. yes, master no, you needn't.

I guess it is him who did it. uncle,what did Huishi do, you said. it is he who stole the kungfu book. it is he who killed the king of kungfu. and killed uncle Huichen, too. no, Uncle Huishi is a good man. how could he killed them? you know nothing. what I said is right. grandfather, grandfather something happened. something strange, something strange. what? the body of Mr Shi and Miss Shi disappeared. ah? Both disappeared? such a bad man from our temple. This made me so sad. Jinxu yes notice arhat room, ask them to go dowmhill. you must catch uncle Huishi back. ok. so many people died under my QISHA kungfu. livc if you follow me and die if you betray me. think it over. such a bad man wants to bribe me,xiong Yang, daydreaming. young master, your QISHAkungfu is very good. you should be the king of kungfu. who is next one? no smilling in jiangnan flexible dragon, in mind. insidious snake, in heart. cruel tiger, in power. sharp crane, in willpower. violent leopard, in force. dragon, snake, tiger, crane,leopard how is things now? young master, that's ok. It is time to go to Mr Shi. your master said you wanted to go downhill. Why? I will catch Uncle Huishi back. He stole the treasure. haha, you are so kind. but you are a little conceited. brother Huikong. brother. the eighteen arhats did not find Huiwu. can he find? this is his feeling. how is his kungfu? good. Yilan, you are willing to remove the evil. I allow you go downhill. as a rule, can you pass the arrangement of eighteen arhats? I want to have a try. uncle, be merciful. be gentle. uncle, let me pass. master is look at us. I cann't. ok, I fight. stop. Yilan, you are quanlified at present and be careful. take care. uncle, please allow me to use the two-stick weapon. good every uncle, I have learned all the kungfu so try not to take mercy on me. throw away your stick, I will loose my hand or I will make your beard off. master, Yilan passed. Yilan, you are quanlified and you can go now. what relation you and SHI'S I am Yonghuang, the grandfather died of the disease. left me alone I am in charge of all here. haha that's great. take out the brand. oh, the brand? yes, since Mr Shi died another king shoul appear. but according to the rules what rules, fist is rules. the man whose fist is the hardest is the new king. in your words, the kungfu meeting which appear once in ten years is a joke? I tell you, all parts in the world the men who have the quanlification to be the king were killed by my magic fist.. magic fist? you won't take out the brand, you want to have a try on my fist? I think, though Mr Shi is dead her daughter is alive. anybody who wants to take the brand should ask me. what a beautiful girl! you cann't keep the brand. hehe, you can have a try. go away. come down! give in or not? no it is a shame that the big guy bullies the little girl. come down, Yilan. hwo you came? why you fought with them? this man is Qinglu. he wants to be the king. he asked me to take out my daddy's brand. the king? you are Qinglu. you want to be the king? I tell you, the man who is quanlified to be the king is here. who are you? who am I?You will be afraid if I tell you. stand upstraight. I am the best one, the strongest one, the brightest,Yilan. enough? haha Yilan, his kungfu is really good. oh, you take it for me, I will teach him a lesson. touch your stomach? cann't be locked,It is flexible. help, please let him go. go quickly. my son is terribly stupid. so don't put it in your mind. He is good. yes. bring here. in fact, brand should be taken out quickly but according the the rules,the brand should be passed by the master. I suggest we go to the shaolin temple seperately seven days later and tell all the people. and your kungfu is the best, the brand is yours of course you don't care these days? or the other people will think you are robbing. this will be bad for your honour. ok, I agree. so see you seven days later. please so conceited. uncle, I am your son? You are a monk. if I did not say this, you will die. I can win him. not necessary. I know his kungfu is good, so I lead him to the shaolin temple. the master will deal with him. every body go except the men in the diciplin part. Huiwu, you are a monk, but you stole the fist book. you killed the king of kungfu and killed Huichen. you say, what is wrong? since I came to the temple I know the reason. Now it is not worthwhile. It is hard for me to explain. I hope you can invest. you needn't explain. the diamond blood mark is the proof. If you are not guilty why you escaped? a? i don't know how my father died and Qinglu appeared again, he tried to grap the brand. I am too young terrible kungfu, I can't keep my father's brand. so I bring the brand back, I hope you can keep it. Qinglu, how old is he? about thirty, the fist, outstanding. his fist? yes, who are you? I am Qinglu. It is said that the king, Mr Shi died. the kungfu should have a king. I came here for the brand. this? where he learned the fist? I think master should check it. Shaolin seven fists. It disappeared for over hundreds of years. where I learned from? It is a shame you ask me. haha. uncle, he cann't be so rude in shaolin temple. if the theft of the fist book is known to all the prestige of shaolin will go away. I think we should tolerate it. our young master came here for the brand it just give you face. in fact everyone should say yes to our master's kungfu. if you donn't you will die. master, uncle, this guy is so rude,why not give him a lesson? we monks donn't strive against them. I am not the monk, I hate it. today I should teach you a lesson. hi, Mr Lu, Let us play a while. haha, you are the loser. last time you are lucky, you didno't die. This time you come again. you are so conceited, why not change to another job? today we don't know wether you play with me or I play with you. come over if you are a man. crane go to the sky. give you three pieces. play the chess with king of the hell. what fist are you playing? five shapes fist oh, five shapes fist? stop, we cann't hurt people in the temple. you don't hurt me, I hurt you. dragon snake tiger crane leopard dragon snake tiger crane leopard Qing, Qing I know who you are. you are Qingtian Lu who lost the king position thirty years ago. thank you for your rememory I won all the people with my kungfu at the kungfu meeting that year. but your monks said I was too young, had no enough prestige. it is you who made me lost the king position. I hate you, I swear I will take revenge. so you change your name, cut your hair to be a monk, live in the temple? yes, I live here for thirty years I take the fist book. I want my son to be the king of kungfu. I need the genarations of LU to be the king of kungfu. I feel it is very strange since the fist bood was stolen. when I found the false diamond blood mark I guess there is a hidden traitor in temple. but I didn't think it is you. it is me. I killed Mr Shi and Huichen. my father had no hatred with you. I killed the strongest rival for my son. how you killed when you in the sealed room. there is a secret road to the outside. what's wrong with Huichen? he suspected me and ask for my actions. I have no way but killed him. why you said it was me who killed them. a scapegoat will make me safe. ok, now all of you understand. today I will take the thirty years' revenge. the new hatred of killing my son, destroy shaolin. it is me who killed your son, have nothing to do with shaolin. leopard who? who hit me? don't stop me. who are you? foot, foot oh, oh you cruel, you cruel it is my turn to hit you. why you stop me? Go away. the worse you help snake tiger five in all master, stop hitting
