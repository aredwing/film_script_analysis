Live long...Live long Congratulations.. -Here eat some sweets. You were in first place in your.. exams! Bravo! Ok..now tell me where your father is? Karan Bhai....what happened to you? Today you got hit again? That's what happens when you get late. Hey Suman...don't think too much.. of yourself! You hardly studied a little... 87% inter.... Even I know this inter-pinter... CAT...cat, for cat Tell me...right or wrong?" Okay...now you give me your hand. Here...have some ladoo Suman. I've got hurt here. - Where? - Here! Wait...careful! You father and daughter share a lovely relationship. I only live for her. Otherwise this is not the age for me to be dancing. My blessing is that you keep jumping and dancing like this. Your job is confirmed in Dubai. Six month job and good remuneration. Here is your passport and all the requisite papers. But what have you thought about Suman? I think I'll leave her at my friend, Kishen's place in the city. You're very worried for me. That's why you're leaving me. I'm only worried about you. I have to earn money. The house has to be done up. I have to get you married. I'll really miss you. I'll stay here and wait for you. I don't know anybody in the city. ls that what's worrying you? Listen to what she's saying. Silly girl! They'll pamper you. I have that relation with them. It's been years since I met Kishen. Sometimes such a hunger arises to hug him that... Sometimes my heart runs towards you. And sometimes towards him. Towards his friendship. I don't know when the foundation was laid. And why? I never studied but he was always into books. I'd keep looking at him. Going to town, progressing, earning money... But his pocket was always empty. He felt shy taking money from me. He would smile and I'd be happy. Once he sold his books in order to return my money. I slapped him real hard! He thought my friendship was an obligation. I felt peace only after bringing back his books. I remember when he got married. He stepped into a new world. I got a cute sister-in-law. She was always smiling. But I knew she was sad. To have a little flower in her bosom. I took them to the temple. We pleaded for wishes, kept fasts. Then Lord Rama gave them a boon. With a name that would make all hearts bloom. Kishen's fate looked up with the birth of his son. He went to city. He started his own business. And became a big man. They came here again. When your mother passed away. For a week she looked after you. Like a mother. While leaving she hugged you and cried a lot in the train. Then the train went far away. For some years he wrote letters. Then he became very busy in work. But he kept coming in my thoughts. - What's wrong? - Nothing Dad. We'll go to the city tomorrow. The house is beautiful. Suman is beautiful. I smell something delicious! I know you smell something delicious. It's lentils tempered with cumin seed and asafoetida. I'll serve it in a while. - Tell your master... - ls Kishen at home? - Yes. - And you didn't tell me! He's having a meeting. Cancel the order. We should have contacts only with the best. Why contact him on the phone. I'll go over to meet him. See how he'll meet me! Relations with small people do not behoove us now. How are you? Forgive me for interrupting. I just couldn't stay away. You finish your work. I'm outside with your wife. Sister-in-law, he's converted home into office. He never listens to me. His hair is graying. ls he working very hard? Age too is racing past. Our son too is grown up. Yes, where is he? He used to call me Babuji when he was small. I gave him his name. Prem. How can I forget? I got my son only because of your prayers. This is all thanks to God. That he has such good parents. But where is he? My husband insisted and sent him to America for studies. He's finishing studies and will return tomorrow. Not since yesterday, I know Ranjit for years. And his daughter, Seema. Ranjit is one of the wealthiest men here. Don't embarrass me, in this city if anyone has prospered... It is you. To own 14 factories in a short time is incredible. We're setting up a huge factory together. What's your business? I'm a diesel mechanic. I've just come to the city I'll leave tonight for Dubai. - You could've stayed for awhile. - When I return I'll stay long. I'm leaving her here. If she makes a mistake, don't hesitate to scold her. We should make a move. I have an important meeting with the bankers. - Or I'd have dropped you to the airport..- Go ahead and work. - Arrange for the driver. - yes. See you. Won't you hug me once? Now, go. Let's have a little conference after the meeting. Come, Papa has left. Papa has left! He's Manohar. Prem's childhood friend ls he afraid of Kishen? Are you? Peep inside him. He's like wax. I can't even look at his outside How can I peep within him? If he's here, I go the other way. Bananas give you muscles. - You're eating again? - I'm fasting today. Lying? - Show Suman the house. - Yes. Let's begin with the kitchen. I committed a grave sin today. - What? - I lied to mother. But she won't feel bad. I know her since childhood. Only the lucky orphans get so much of love! Why are you dressing up and putting lime on your face instead of working? Servants in our house talk in English. Brothers tell us why this make up? She...is going to come. - My beloved. - Let's go. Won't you introduce me? This is Gulabiya, the milkmaid. She comes and goes, has no other job! - That's all. Come on. - Madam... Tell him to show me television. Drama... on the sly. - Want to see television? - Yes. - Slyly? - Yes. - Ashamed in front of others? Shall I square your accounts? When will you do it? Not now. I'm not in the mood. When I have the time. Everything is hot here. Let's go! My beloved is my foe. Take the milk! This is your room. White and pure. Open your bags. In the meantime.. - You...? - I'll begin from the kitchen again. I'm hungry. Shall I get you something? You hardly eat anything. I'll get something. You have to eat. - Listen... - Yes? May I call you brother? You're leaving very soon. I'll return soon. Suman, I'm going. Be good and learn everything. I want no complaints. Forgive her if she errs. She cries at little things. You're leaving her. Won't she feel emotional? Today you're crying at my leaving but tomorrow you'll cry leaving them. You'll get so much love here. Okay. See you. - Shall we leave? - Yes, or you might be late. Don't cry dear. Bid farewell to your Dad with a smile. It's so late. Uncle hasn't come. He has no time these days. He's getting a big cabin made for his son Says he'll gift it to him. He's his pampered child. - He loves him a lot. - Don't ask how! He won't meet him like a Dad but like a sportsman. He'll shake hands, wrestle arm. And then they will race. We have to get ahead in this race of father and son. Then you also know why I've trapped him in my friendship. When you've trapped him, why do you pretend to limp? - For sympathy? - lt strengthens friendship. Kumar's life is his son. He likes you so he'll surely make you his daughterinlaw. But Prem is young, has hot blood. Don't worry, Papa. You pretend to be friends. I'll pretend to be in love. - Careful! - Let him go! The road is blocked ahead. he'll be trapped. I won't be trapped! Move! We won finally! You've never driven this fast. There's another reason for this. The times of knocking at the door seem to have gone. The times of locking the door too seem to have gone. I was looking for you. Met him? - Where's Prem? - Changing in his room. For you. - Are you going to Prem's room? - Why? Any objections? It will be better if you open his door carefully. - Hope you're not hurt. - What prank is this? Will you practice your talent of boxing on us? Save yourself if you can. May I come in? I'll wear my clothes. What did you do in America? - Studies. - Studies? Who studies these days? Don't pretend to be innocent! Don't leave me and go. I feel very lonely. Lunch is served. Everybody is waiting. If you're free, will you sit with her for awhile? She's feeling very lonely. - Sure. - I'm an expert in loneliness. May ljoin in to pass time? That's because I ate corn. Prem recited a nice couplet about you in the car. Shall I tell you? Yes. It's like this. Pay attention. I want applause. Are these your tresses or a net of satin? How fortunate are the rats who nibbled away your hair! Please sit... Your walk man. You like my poem so much that you broke the glass? You're very old fashioned. I'll tell you an imported line. You'll break the entire house. You said shut up. I said cut up... Your cap. For you, from me. - For me? - Can't I give a gift to my friend? Friend? But we just met. A friend is one you want to meet and talk to. Whom you like. And then our fathers are friends. And this cap has been made for friends. There's one rule in friendship. Today again the son won the race. Whenever I lose to him, I'll celebrate my losing. One should have a son like Prem! Let's go Seema. Your son possesses all your qualities Now get the cigarette! I've been trying for so long! People puff away constantly. When did you begin? Sometimes I'd take a puff after dinner in America. Hurry up! Why are you removing tobacco? - It's finished. - It's finished? Now where can we get it? Let me think. - We'll get it! - Where? In Papa's room, in the white cigarette case. Papa must be downstairs. Go and get it. Are you mad? I won't go! But why are you so scared of Papa? - Will you go or not? - I won't go! - I'll hit you! - Chop my head with a sword. But don't send me to 440 volts. Let's go together. And die together. All right. Let's go. I have work. That way. Go and get it alone. Open sesame! What are you doing here? Clearly say what you want. Prem has asked for a cigarette. - I mean a book. - Which one? Our dear Papa. Prem asked for it, not me! Grandfather not papa. Uncle not grandpa. Our dear Vivekanand. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Exercise. Here you are. He was a great man. I'll read it in the day and return it by evening. Brother, what are you hiding? I went to borrow a book for Prem. This is the cigarette... The day is bad. I'll go mad! He's not here. Give the master his tea in his room. Sugar separate. He's here. Idiot! Do something! Now what will we do? Why do you hang these? I've brought sweetmeats for you. Keep them there. I'll eat them. But I'll feed him myself. Open your mouth. Why is your face swollen? - Open your mouth. - Mother, we were boxing. Why do you keep fighting? I'm keeping these here. Eat them later. What's burning? ls something burning? No, mother. This is burning. Brought it from the prayer room? Give it to everybody. I need this! You saved us today! This cigarette had me...! You also throw it away. I said throw it away! He's not throwing it! injurious to health. She asked you to and you put it off. Of course. You have to do it if you make friends. This time I'll play Olympics. You can't! Just eat bananas! Lost again! Better stop playing. - You've lost to me the third time - I know. - Fool! - And you're a champion? Of course I'm the champion! - Playing table tennis? - No, we were swimming. - Greedy hog! - Why are boys so vain about their game? Because this game requires stamina and brains which girls don't have. ls that so? Shall I play to show? Yes, I'll watch with mother. This looks like your Dad's letter. - Look at him. Does he look like a champion? - No way. You lost to me 3 times Maybe you'll win with a toffee! Don't want to play? - Later. - Saw that? First I'll play to show. Then, later. Why is she crying? Her father has written. She will feel emotional. Wipe your tears. She's not wiping them. To feel sad and cry alone... It's injurious to health. Good! He said it once and you wiped your tears. Of course. If you make friends, you have to do it. P: You? Come in. How is the pain? It's a little hurt- it will be fine-. There's one rule to friendship. Keep this medicine there. Shall I apply it? I'll keep my eyes shut. Do you know what mother says about me? That I make friends wherever I go. Abroad. But you are different from all of them. You, your talks. Everything is different. Do you know? Won't you say anything? You can open your eyes. Why? What's the matter? - Nothing. - Really? Girls are like this! Crazy! Come in Prem. This is my nephew, Jeevan. He'll learn work with us. Let's have the inauguration this Sunday. I've organized a party for Saturday. Just friends. You must come. She's called you for the party Why are you taking me along? I won't go without you. - Why? - What do you mean? Answer me why? - Because... - Because? I won't tell! Do you know you're looking handsome. I'm very handsome. Know what mother says about me? That I look dashing when I shave and wear a coat. - Are you getting bored? - No. I have a certain style. Mother praising me is obvious. There's something in some people. What are you doing? Aren't you ashamed? You have no right to take any one's life to practice shooting. This pigeon is mine. I bought it. My brother has all the right if he wants to shoot it. Who are you to interfere? Give it to me. This is the limit! What do you think of yourself? Mind your tongue! Come on. We won't stay here any longer. This goes on in friendship. Apologize to her. - What's wrong? - What does she think of herself? No manners at all! - You felt hurt? - Of course! Now don't ask why. Why? Get me some food. I'm famished. After dinner tell me what else mother says about you. I won't be bored. Are you taking this for Prem? We too are hungry. What's wrong? Have I committed a crime in touching her? You want the same thing I want. There's something about her. Not one more word! She won't be worthy of you? You're quite worried about her. ls she your private property? - What is she? - His friend. Friends did you hear that? Can a young boy and girl be friends? See this scene of young friendship! A good drama of friendship! A girl and boy are never friends. This is a curtain to hide the flames of passion on dark nights. Great! Friendship in a new house brought good dividends. Congratuhte them. - Stop them. - How many will you stop? You are the cause of this. Don't let this relation grow. Which will give Prem nothing but defamation. A girl and boy can never be friends. Friendship in a new house can bring good dividends. Don't let this relation grow. It won't give Prem anything but for defamation. Your cap. Mr. Prabhu will be bringing some papers from the head office. Send them to the site. I'll go in Prem's car. Hurry up. It's getting late. Coming. It would be nice if you'd come for the opening of the factory. You'll be left alone at home. - Brother will be here. - As you wish. Come on, son. I don't know what the world calls our relation. I don't know the limits of this relationship. I only know this much I have loved you. What is this if not love? I laugh if you laugh. I cry if you cry. Where there's love, the heart gets hurt. I love you. I wish I'd understood the depth of this relation earlier. Uncle and Aunt have come. - Where's Uncle? - He's gone to the factory. Why did you return so early? Dragged by the friend's friendship. - What do you mean? - I'd called so he ran. - What happened to you? - Stomach upset for 2 days. Always eating trash. No food for him for 2 days. Nothing? But now I'm fine. Traffic constable! Mustn't listen to her. Get some food. It's a banana. Alone. Nice, isn't it? You were saying something? - Not now. - Fine. We'll go boating this evening. Don't say, not now then. Be prepared. What's cooking? The neighborhood ladies are coming for prayers. Lots of guests will be coming. They will stay for dinner. - There's lots of work. - These fat guys will do it. - I'll take you out. - Me? Didn't find anybody else? Shall we come? Give me those and rest for a while. Sister, fry these. Do you have henna on your hands? - No. - Shall we apply it? I have some work. 5 minutes. It's 4:15. Just 5 minutes. It happens. - Henna? - Henna! See how it looks on my hands. Are you tired? Are you very angry? Won't you talk to me? No! I'm not in the mood. May I say something to put you in a good mood? I don't want to hear anything. I'll still say it. You may hear it if you want. Not in the mood now. That's too much! Now if you pretend, I'll tell mother! That the marriage season is on. Get me married elsewhere. Go right now. Mother! I have something important to discuss. - Aren't you worried about me? - Why? What happened? Have you ever looked at me? I've grown up. Don't you want to get me married? Already thinking of marriage? You shouldn't take these things lightly. Children shouldn't be given freedom these days. So far I'm very decent but if I slip up somewhere? Papa stiff neck will be bent. But how do I know what kind of a girl you'll like? That's absolutely clear in my eyes. She must never wear salwar kameez. She shouldn't have long hair. Absolutely short. Mother, this and that... She should be an atom bomb. But such a girl won't do anything in the house. - She won't shell peas. - She will aunt. - Won't she? - Yes, she will! Respect for elders, mingling with her age and love for youngsters. - She won't possess these qualities - She will respect everyone. - Won't she? - Yes, she will. And I'll force her if she doesn't. Start looking for a bride for me. Will you have some tea? If I eat, it will only be after my marriage. Fell down! It happens. Now I'm going to bed. Now I have to search for a bride for his majesty. That too of his choice. He's lived in America! - Good day. - How are you? Lord! I'm dying of hunger. The difficulties of the devotee... The food runs away! Dinner. Eat it fast. No! No! - What's the matter? - lt vanishes. - It's fake. - No, it's real. It is real! May I eat it? Feed it to me. You are so nice... What's this? - What's wrong? - Full moon night and you're sad? He hasn't eaten dinner. So even you haven't eaten. Then even I won't eat. ls he annoyed? Please him. What does he want? He wants me to hold my ears and say, l love you thrice. - Only then will he eat. - Then say it. How can I say it? He's sitting with the women. I feel shy. That's how he's troubling you! Come on. To tell him. We can be one up on him We'll give him tit for tat! You'll say it now, in front of everyone. In order to spend some time let's sing songs in a game. - Who will play? - All of us will play! - Won't you play? - I don't want to! - Scared of girls! - I'm scared? - Of course! - We'll see! Let's begin. Now begin. Will you sit here? - Next to me? - Yes. - Yes. - For prayers? I'll give you one! Go away! Why are you yelling? I am going. - We will win. Come here. - Go and see your face! Sir, she too hasn't eaten. - She'll eat it. - No, you'll have to feed her. - Come with me. - Where? Let's go and talk to Prem about his wedding. I think I should get a daughterin-law as soon as possible - Yes. - Come on. - Going to the office? - Yes. Why? Nothing. Have your breakfast and sit with us for a while. - What's the matter? - Nothing. We've come to discuss your marriage. - Marriage? - Yes, I've found you a bride. What is it? She's just as you had wanted. She doesn't wear salwar kameez.. The only things she wears are... But listen to me.. Don't worry. Her hair isn't long. She's like this and that. Mother, sit down. - Listen... - She's giving it with love. I thought a lot yesterday. You are right. Such a girl won't work in the house. - She won't shell peas. - She will. Right? If she won't, I'll make her. But mother, respecting elders, loving youngsters. She won't do that She won't? Then what should we do? You find a different type of girl. Find one of your choice. - Will my choice do? - Of course it will! - Won't she do? - If you say so... - She'll do. - There's no hurry. Take your time to think before telling me. - Will she do? - I'm going. Crazy fool! I m really fortunate. Will you be my crazy son's Suman? Stay here to spread fragrance in my home forever. I only want both of you to be happy. Must be Prem. You talk to him. I'm off. Mother said something to me today. Today mother said something to me too. What do you think? Today is a really beautiful day. I want to be colored in this colorful weather. Will you join me? Had it! Going to Prem's room? Yes and I'll be careful Any objections? He's not in there. He has gone out with his future bride. He has decided to marry Suman. Any objections? Come in. By accepting your proposal for his son, sir has obliged us. You may not believe it but I'd chosen a sample ...of a wedding card in anticipation of this day. She likes it very much. Then we also like it. Let your wife too approve of it. Jeevan show it to her. - It's her choice too. - No, uncle. What do you mean? She likes somebody else. The girl you gave refuge to, is dreaming of marrying into your house! She's taking advantage of Prem's innocence. Nobody just gifts an expensive locket to anyone! Some people are known for grabbing rights! When I tried to show her her place, she slapped me! Excuse me but if somebody has a hand in this, it's that cheat's father! Your friend! You have done your duty as a friend. But he's a stain of friendship! He left his daughter her on purpose. Suman's birthday falls in 2 days. Can't say what she might ask Prem for as a gift. Did you call me? Yes, there's some urgent work in our new plant. I may not be able to go. Instead you should go. Leave by 6 in the morning. - Tomorrow? - Why? Some other work? I'll go. So you're going? And breaking your promises? Even I want to stay back. - Then refuse Dad. - No. You must go if uncle has asked you to Don't disobey him. We'll celebrate some other day. - But... - Brother. Nobody listens to us! - When will you return? - In 4 or 5 days. I'll be waiting. Now we wait for Prem to leave. Tomorrow morning Kumar will tell Suman of his decision. Her heart will break. He's given it to me. Why are you jealous? Look away. Who is it? How could I leave without celebrating your birthday? Now come here. - How are the gifts. - Very nice. - Shall I wear them? - There's one more. Somewhat like this. Shall I wear it and show? Don't send me away. Should I return early? Live long dear. Happy birthday. May I take tea for uncle? So you want to serve your father-in-law tea by yourself? Hold it. ls today your birthday? - Yes. - How old are you? L!. You're very smart for an 18 year old. I have nothing against you. You've been given the convenience of staying here not the right. With what right have you stepped into my son's life? I want an answer! I'll give you the answer. Prem's love has given her that right. My decision to make her my daughterinlaw! She can't be our daughterinlaw! - Why not? - Because she came here as a guest. She's dreaming of owning this place! She and her father contrived to own this property worth lakhs! She and her father have stabbed my friend in the back! Whose friendship are you accusing? The one who supported us in poverty and difficult times? Thanks to whom we have a son! What will he do with wealth? You seem to have forgotten the meaning of friendship today! Look at her innocent face once. - Can she do this? - Her face shields her plan. Now she can't stay here for a minute! She has to leave now! This is my decision! Happy birthday my child! You're crying? Silly! I've come. I left everything to reach right on your birthday. To your and my friend! Why is everyone so quiet? See what I've brought for everyone. Keep it here. Have some sweets. I bought you a pen. This is your tool. Hello. I bought you sarees. I picked them all up. All the colors suit you. Where is Prem? Son, see what Babuji bought for you! What a way to win hearts! Both father and daughter! Why? Have I or my daughter done something wrong? Really sir, these poor lowly people are like this! Blood sucking parasites! - Control your tongue! - You should've control. Controlled your daughter! What she has done here! She has brought shame to this family! She has shown her true colors! What did you say! Stop this bestiality! Enough! Did you hear what he said about Suman? He is right! You took undue advantage of my friendship! You left her here with ulterior motives! So that she could trap Prem in her love and own this house! I never imagined you could spin a golden web for wealth! Don't scream! Before dreaming of converting our friendship into relationship... You should have seen the distance between us. Where I earn lakhs, you make 2000 a month! Isn't it 2000? Come to my position first and then see these dreams! Stop it! Now you've gone far from me My friendship is a burden now! Today my clothes stink! The daughter of this man who earns only 2000 is not fit to stay here! I accept it and don't blame you. But why this false accusation on my child? My daughter is my pride! - Answer me, why? - First of all you kept her here! - I did you a favour and... - Favour? You obliged me by keeping my daughter? ls this all that remains of our friendship? No. I won't be obliged to you! I'll pay the price of your 5 star hotel! In which you kept my daughter and fed her! What are the lodging and boarding charges here? 5000? 10000? 20000? 50000? Answer me! I'm going! I'll be waiting for you outside this five star hotel! The bonds of the heart are broken. I don't have the courage. Sir is waiting for you. I have to talk to you. We will talk son. But in your own cabin. Sit on this chair and take charge of the company. For what crime are you punishing me? This is a gift for you. - Now make your own decisions. - I had taken one decision. Of marrying Suman. Why was that rejected? Yes Papa- Why? I'll explain to you, son. Your Papa need not give you explanations. Where are you going? - I'm leaving home. - Why? But even your son need not give you any explanation. Listen to me. What do you lack? All this is yours. Next week you're getting engaged to Seema. The cards have been given! Sir, you explain to him. He hasn't seen the world outside which is cruel and wicked. He can't even walk properly on the roads. - I will learn. - You don't even know... How difficult it is to earn money. - What a struggle it is! - I will learn. Learn? what will you learn? You don't even know how to learn. Love teaches everything. Stop him before I take nay step! He hasn't honored his father He'll at least honor your love! When she was here, I couldn't give these to her. When you meet my daughterin-law slip these bangles on her wrists. Mother, am I right? Are you with me? I needn't fear anything? Are y0U going? But we are to get engaged? Please don't leave me. All right. Then come with me. Come on. Thinking? People in love never think. Uncle has come! I am Prem. I know you are angry. Papa abused you quite a bit. I apologize to you. The father wounds and the son applies salver. Apologizes! Go away before I thrash you. I haven't come to go away. I've given up everything and come to marry Suman. Mother has sent these bangles for Suman as a symbol of her acceptance. Go inside, Suman. Go inside! I always followed my heart. Maybe that's why I never became rich Like your father! But today I understand the world! I've learnt today. Sister-inlaw's bangles can't move me! I survived the accusation of looting wealth! But I won't bear being accused of stealing bangles! Hear this carefully! My child won't marry into that house! Even if your father comes to my door and rubs his nose! I love her. N0, YOU played a game! Like your father! I'm going to see a boy for my daughter tomorrow. Hear it well! P: What do you want? Why are you bent on ruining my child! I've come to give her all the joys you want for her. Joys for her? Where? In that hollow world of your father's? I'll make my own world. You are angry with my father not me. Look at me just once. Forget I'm Kumar's son. Judge me after separating me from my father's name. Like any normal boy, I've come to ask for your daughter's hand. All right. Come. How much do you earn? What do you earn? How this question hurts! It cuts through the heart! Your father similarly asked me... A man earning 2000 a month has to reach his status before dreaming! Today I ask you, what is your status? Dad, what are you saying? You stay out of this. You can't settle down by running away. How will he look after you? If his love is true, Let him prove that... Let him reach my status. Earn 2000 rupees! Then let him dream. I'll earn it. I'll prove my love. In this very village. In front of you. I'll earn 2000 in one month. These are mother's bangles. Keep them safe with you. I'll give them to Suman when the condition is met. 2000? In one month! This is a hilly region. We only work on stones and wood. This isn't even the tourist season. You are educated. Go to the city. No, I have to earn it here. Give me any work. Even the last batch of workers is full. - Has the truck driver come? - No sir. Labor is sitting idle at the other side. The road is so dangerous. Who will take the lorry? - I'll take it. - You? I want work! Give me the key of the truck. ls this the time to come? Comes to work, drunk! You may go. We've kept another driver - Another driver? - Yes. Square his account. This is insulting. Another driver when you're around? Brother! Listen... stop the truck. What are you doing? Stop the truck! That's enough! Now move aside. You love to drive trucks? Wants the truck! Saw the outcome of kicking me out of my job! Take the key of the truck. Every man has his earning written when he comes here. But if you don't respect it, it won't wait for you. If you look at him, the hands that taught you driving will... ...make you forget it! Get lost! Hope you're not hurt. Who is it? Sit down. Eaten? Forget it son. You can't do this. One day has tired you out. 29 days still remain. You have lost. Go back. Take your mother's bangles back. This is my first earning. And the first earning is given to an elder, isn't it? Who is yours. Bless me. Son. You can stay here if you wish. Your father obliged me by keeping my daughter in his house. I can oblige you. If you want to oblige me, then only do this... Don't let tears come to Suman's eyes. Now I'll come to your step only after completing the condition. After 29 days! It's terribly cold here! And I forgot my sweater. How did you know I was coming? How are Prem and Suman? - Welcome sir. - These guys keep laughing? Just follow my friend. Sir says to just follow. But who is to be followed? - Behind that? - Yes. - Really? - Why are you scared? He's a special friend of mine. Came to the station to take me! Walks with such style! And what a name! Why did you stop? Your friend is looking at you! My friend is here. - No, here. - Where? - He's coming here! - Don't leave me alone! Look after your brother! Your brother ran away. I came only for you! Quiet! What's your name? - Looks like Freedevi! - What? Then I'm Jitendra! Let's go to the garden. We'll have an ice cream. Let's go. - I'll comb my hair. - They're fine. Come on! My honor is in your hands, Basanti, come on! May you be ruined! Pretends to be Jeetendra! Meet me and I'll show you! Mother has sent you her love. Everybody misses you. How is Gulabiya? I knew you'd ask! How do I know? Am I her bodyguard? Instead she's my body guard! - Sir, where are you? - Here. - How do you feel after a bath? - Fresh. I'll like it even more if I sit there. - I'm very hungry but if you say" - Go ahead and eat. What should I eat? The food looks delicious. Sit and eat. I'm off. Emergency food. - What's wrong? - Such a pretty face and sad? What s the matte r? - How is mother? - Very well. Mother has sent money for you along with sweetmeats. - I don't need the money. - What do you mean? - I won't take this money. - Then what will you do? Will you burn yourself all month? What sin have you committed? Love has no conditions. Then why this pretense? Come here and listen to me. There's 5000 in this. Give him 2000 and get married today itself. I'll arrange for the priest. If you won't listen to me, our friendship is finished. Won't my blood boil seeing you in this state? Do you remember what I told Papa when I left? Love teaches everything. If I take this money, how will I ever learn? What do you want? Do you want to prove my love false? Will you then respect your friend? I'll keep the money. I love her. I have to do this. Go and tell mother, today I've learnt the value of money. What do you say? Sridevi has come dressed up! It is said your prayers come true. Pray for my friend. That he gets married soon. I pray to God your wishes come true! - Don't take his name! - Why? Isn't he your son? I have no son! You don't have a son? ls he an orphan like me? ls Prem an orphan despite having parents? One more word and I'll lose my shirt! Do you recall when Prem would fall sick as a child...? You'd stay awake all night. You'd willingly lose out to him. Now you've left him alone in the race of life. How can you leave him? How can you say you don't love him? Answer me! Have you got your answer? Yes. Mother, he loves him a lot. He is pining for him, just like you! What proof can we ask from a helpless father? I'll take you out today. Lame uncle. Listen to me You too go out for a while. There'll be some peace in this house! Mother! Picking up fights with us! If you say I'll jack him! Begin. Help! Thank the Lord. God knows who played this prank. - Rest for awhile. - No, every moment is precious. The wound is deep. Try to understand You're even running fever. My Papa. Please be seated sir. You move away. Start the machine. I'm coming. A very decent child. How are you, son? Get one cup of tea. Special. Sugar separate. How are you? What's all this for? What do you think? If you earn 2000 bucks, will Karan let you marry his daughter? No, this is his plan. Shall we race back home once again? I've brought your car along. The vehicle has changed. Stick to your guns. In this dirt, dust, filth! Yes. I wasted your precious time. No, I've reinforced my ideals. - You won't manage. - It's my struggle. Isn't it also my struggle? Are you leaving? Please drink this tea of your son's earning. You' ll get thrilled-. P: There's been no account kept of our new factory. Jeevan was given the responsibility on your commendation. What answer do you have for the workers complaints? When you drew the amount from the bank in time, why weren't they paid? It's very difficult to progress with dishonesty. Go and apologize to them. - Go. - I don't apologize. Half the share of this factory is my son's. I won't tolerate his name being sullied! What son? The one who crushed your dreams? You should be ashamed of yourself! Get out! Great! You had won his trust! No leeway for suspicion! He forced you to lower your head in front of those measly workers! I even felt ashamed when his fool of a son rejected my daughter's love! I never loved him. - But you pretended to! - There's a difference. Either way we were humiliated. Then and now once again! - Now it's our turn. - Yes. So far he has only seen my friendship Now he'll also suffer the attack of my enmity. Good day. Leg healed itself? Whose colors are you going to show me today? I've come to extend a hand of friendship to you. Even I hate Kumar. For years I was loyal to him as a friend... He insulted my friendship. I want to teach him a lesson. Why don't we combine forces and burn him with the fire in our hearts? Yes sir. Can you ever forget how he treated your innocent child? Can you forget the atrocities? I want every newspaper to print what he did to us. Cover all the press... Go to court against him! Destroy him! He won't be able to walk with his head held high! So, shall we shake on that? Get out! lam going but I'd like to know one thing... You are his enemy. So am I. Then why the difference between us? Scoundrel the difference is only that your gait changes with time. - Meaning? - Didn't understand? You won't even understand. You are made that way! I'll show you what I'm made of! To both of you! That day has come! Here are 2000 including your night shift last night You've earned another 200. I need only this. Today is Friday. Donate a sheet to the mausoleum on our behalf. Going? Go on. Suman must be waiting. I know that day has come. Going to get married? All of us have come for your wedding. Come on guys, dress up the groom. Adorn him with flowers. Let me go. She must be waiting. She's waiting for him. Let him go. ls this what you earned in one month with your sweat? Your life is in it. Let me see how much it weighs. What? Prem is missing for 2 days? I was driving past and thought I'd meet him. I even asked Karan but why would he answer? He's burning to take revenge. Come soon. I fear Karan might... What s the matte r? The game of love is over. It's destiny. Let's tell uncle the good news. I've kept your word. Take these. Can I now ask for your daughter's hand? Can I dream? Can I now meet her? The condition is not met. Why? This is my money. Mother had sent money. But I didn't take it. Swear by Suman. This is my money. Forget it Suman. The condition was to earn money. Not wet pieces of paper. What's the value of this money? They are giving way. Useless. Look carefully. Some of them don't even have the numbers. What can you give my daughter with these wet notes? Nothing. Not even 2 square meals. I don't want 2 square meals! ls this justice? For a whole month he stayed hungry, thirsty and earned this money. You can't see the wounds on his hands. Neither his tears of pain. But you only saw these wet notes? If these have no value, nothing in the world is valuable. No value! Don't be offended by what she says. It's love for me that makes her lose courage. Give me another chance. One more chance. I'll earn again. I'll bring the money again. And this time I promise... I promise the notes won't be wet. You have won. I cant test you anymore. I can't Suman! This money is priceless! Your love has won. I've tormented you so much! Isn't it? Where is my son? If something happens to him, I... Why are you silent? Why are your lips sealed? When a man does some wrong, his face is stripped of decency! - Where is his son? - I don't know his son! I only know the boy who has made his own identity today. And I'm proud of him! Would you like to meet him? Surprised to see me alive? It's fate. Your closest friend tried to kill your son today. And Jeevan is responsible for it. No, it's a lie. When a man does something wrong, his face is stripped of decency! No, he's like my son. Why should I ...? Let go! This is how you repay my trust? Those who trust others have to listen to abuses. Like him! Another water balloon on his face! - That's 24! - Tying up mother! You hit him. Make a silver jubilee. - No. - Hit him! - Hail the Mother! - Hail the Mother! - Say it loudly! - No shame tying up mother! Go and save her my son. Won't you hug me once? Oblige me just once friend.
