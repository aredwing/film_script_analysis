My whole family was there. My dad, Michele Vernia, marshal with the Tax Police, born down south near Bari. He'd been waiting for this day. Aunt Vittoria, his sister, who raised me like a mother. And this... This... is Uncle Duilio. A true Genoan, a real bundle of energy They won't make him read meters? Does an engineer read meters?! My thesis had fascinated everyone. They were all struck by it. What's up? Congratulations! It's been a long time since we heard such a finely argued defense. I hereby award you a masters in electronic engineering, accompanied by the academic kiss. - Please, don't bother. - No... I insist. You deserve it. Regards to the Marshal. I'd heard those words before. That watch... I'd seen it before too. Put these fakes in the van and have them destroyed. Corporal, you can go. I'll see to this. We can handle it, sir. Corporal, I gave you an order! I said I'll see to it. Is that clear? The body of Christ. Father, I never went to catechism. That's ok, you'll do it later. Regards to the Marshal. Regards to the Marshal. Vernia... You're in a real fix. Me? With your degenerative chronic asthma... I don't have asthma! You do. You're unit for service. Regards to the Marshal. Enough with the watches, Dad! It's corruption! Calm down, young man. It would be if they were real but since they're fake... it's a polite gesture. Auntie? Call it added value. Enough of your tax shoptalk, ok! Where's your brother Jonny? The only one missing. Yo, bros, where's the can? - Upstairs! - Thanks, bro. My brother is kind of special. He's always been crazy about music. We could never figure out why. 'Nth age, it's gotten worse. - What're you drinking? - Soda pop. Can I have soda pop? He was such a fan of John Travolta, we all started calling him Jonny. YOU'RE AWESOME, BRO! Milan! The New York of Italy. Where a graduate makes his dreams come true. Milan never sleeps. Milan has jobs for everyone! Thanks, but we're not hiring. Thanks, but we're not hiring. Ok. Goodbye. Thanks, but you're not hiring. Goodbye. But, in Milan, a highly qualified electronic engineer always ends up with a top-notch job. I'm the printer guy. Follow me, I'll show you. How do we sell this alarm clock? Take my breath away We have some really original ideas. The printer guy.. That's the third one so far. One that works would be nice. - Yes, sir. - Where were we? We have some pretty original ideas, pretty effective ones... Here's the first His is the first "Wake up, guys!" Shit happens... Let's hear the other genius. "It's time for the future!" You think I'm dumb? I knew it. He knew it! - What's so funny? - It's nothing serious. The papers blocked. You don't need a technician. Ok, genius, since you're such hot stuff, give us your idea. - Me? - Yes, you. When he set the alarm clock, my dad always said, "Being first is a matter of seconds. " Being first is a matter of seconds... - That's beautiful! - Really beautiful. You guys won't even understand in 20 years. He's good, huh? Really good! Sometime later - Hello? - Giovanni? Who is it? Who do you think'? Your father! Dad, what's up? it's 6:30 AM. Were you sleeping? No, I wasn't. You're getting sloppy in Milan, son, sleeping so late! Listen to your dad. I'm trying to get your lay about brother hired. I asked a friend, Marshal Vincenzo Di Prima, to get him into the Tax Police. You remember Di Prima? Sure, we played with his son as kids. What's that music? What? You play music while talking to your dad'?! Anyhow, as I was saying, Marshal Di Prima pulled strings and got him through the written exam. Now he has the oral. Do I care? You should. Your brother's oral is in Milan. No, Dad. Can't we sleep around here? You can't do this! I can. You only need to put him up for a week. But when? Who knows? Your brothers unpredictable. Like the IRS. Aren't you getting the entry phone? Enough! - Who is it? - Tax Police! Come up, jerk! He just got there! Be nice to him I'm wasting my breath! Ok, Dad, I have to go. Remember, I only want good news. What's this racket? There, that's settled. Who is it? Federica... My brother. Hey, sister! Number one, bro! Who's this? My girlfriend, Federica.

You have fans? But I brought my throne from home. - You're Pasquinelli, right? - Right. You see that guy? He's setting the place on ire and he paid to get in. You want 5 grand but no one gives a shit about you! Pisquonelli, go fuck yourself! Just go sit on your throne. - Had a good time? - No, Fede... I guess so, you're home so late. It's your brother's fault. After everything that's happened, you should be ashamed. You could at least say something sweet. They stole your car. I can't stand you two anymore! - I'll take the couch? - Yes! Awesome! Hey, sister, this is the men's room. Since you don't understand, I'll make you understand. You really don't recognize me? - I'm Ugo! - Ugo? Ugo, Marshal Di Prima's son. I used to come over to play with Barbies. The wooden puppet with the long nose! I always lost. Ugo... Whove believed it?! You've changed massive! - You're hot now. - Really? The dental braces never suited you, bro. You're still the same. It's great to see you again. Don't trust this guy. First he takes your hand, then he dumps you. Your go-go guy's here. Good luck. A croissant. - Cream or chocolate? - Chocolate. "We are, we are... " I'd never have guessed. What? You always seem so conventional but... But? Don't play dumb. We waved to each other last night. - Last night? - At Gilez. Gilez, right! Yes, I was at Gilez last night. So hows it go, Jonny? "We are, we are... " There's a mistake. You were the only good thing the whole evening. Tell her the truth or you're a worm. Sorry, you talked about a mistake? A mistake... in the hand movements. In the dance you're doing, the hands go like this. Like this, see. that's it. The cow-print pants... Where did you get them? Where did I get them? Good question. Where did I get those pants? Where did I get them? How should I know? But why talk about the place? What remains isn't the memory of a place. What remains are the scents, the atmospheres, the emotions. I remember the horses, galloping horses, the dust and that little kitten mewing on a myrtle branch and I knew then and there that the little girl's dad wasn't her dad. Imagine... the drama of such emotions... Imagine the feelings that I experienced... We don't understand a damn word and we have work to do. I thought of something like, "Crazy Pizza... "Take a bite of America. " But I didn't like it. Thank God. Instead, I'd go for something like... But not "do it", "do eat". Get it? Is there a problem? No, the paper tray's jammed. In that case, if it's jammed... - You take your case... - it's ok. Off you go. The doors that way. Goodbye, thank you. All right. Where was I? You were at "at". Eat... Dad lent us his car. Sweet, isn't he? Yes, really sweet, as usual. - Shit! - Giovanni, I was thinking... - Where are you? - Here. - What's wrong? - Shit, this is a beautiful door. - It is? - You bet. I already have a headache, so out it out. - Let's go. - Now? When else? Where's the handle? Look, interior carpeting! Of course, it's a car. Your cell's ringing. Answer it. "Blocked number". Blocked numbers are a drag. Why? I always use a blocked number. Answer it. - Hello? - Tax Police. Jonny, out the crap. Hi, bro! I'm goin' back to Gilez tonight. I'm in love. Come too and I'll introduce you. No, not tonight. I want to stay in tonight and relax. I'm tired, ok. He hung up. So you're staying in tonight? To relax. What day is it? - What day is it? - Wednesday Cuban music is emotion, vibration, feeling... Live it to the full. Like life itself. Sure he's Cuban? - Totally Cuban. - Yeah? Something bothering you, Jovani? No, this is fun. Come on then! Butt tight... And your eyes in your niOa's eyes to pass the heat on to her. I'll pass that on, thanks. Watch the moves, ok, I have my eye on you! Don't let me down! Cute! 'Excuse me, I'm way up the list! Hi, sister! Hi, Jonny! Jonny, hi! The phenomenon's back! Jonny, getup here! People, Jenny's back! All together now... We are, we are... And now it's time to listen to my master, Guanito MirabaL You have the record I lent you? Paquito has it. Put it on, Paquito. - Ain't workin'. - Plug it in! Wow, that's central Havana dialect. Look. Guanito's record... What's the problem? What the fuck? Thanks, bros! I've worked in a lot of clubs in Rome, Ibiza, London... - Bravo, you're something else. - Thanks. - What's your name? - Jonny. Good, Jimmy I like you. - Want a drink? - Please. What? Jack n'lemon? No thanks. - A Mautau? - I don't drink that. Sky n'water? A goulash? Who drinks goulash? - Have a drink. What'll it be? - Soda pop. Soda pop? Like Tony Manero. Two soda pops. One for him, one for his friend Tony. Remember, this place is your home now, tu casa, mi casa. Do what you want. Come dance, have fun, you, everyone. Silvano, we don't have any soda pop. So find some. Where, at this hour'? How should I know. You get it, it's your job! A nice cold soda pop coming up. - Thanks, bro. Can I dance after? - You have to! You have dancing in the blood! - Off you go, Puppi. - Thanks, bro. That Puppi is hot. - I was a dancer. - Who gives a damn! He's nothing but trouble. First my aquarium, then my car, Pepe's record smashed to bits... He's the biggest moron ever. You're right, Fede, what can I say? I never even spoke about him. He's our black sheep. How can I have a brother like him? We're so different. You want to know the truth? I'm ashamed of him. Don't be so upset, Giovanni. At least he's out of our hair. It's just you and me, ducklin' sister. I didn't give you a name yet. How about Lady Gaga? You look like her too. I love you, Lady (Saga. Say you love me and you'll never leave me. Thanks, sister. We'll be like a family You and me, we'll always be together. Even Lady Gaga doesn't love me. Fine, Dad, Jenny's studying. Ok, let me speak to him. He's studying. Don't disturb him, he's studying for once. When your dad says do something, you do it! Ok. Jonny... Dad wants a quick word with you. Comin'. Hi, bro Dad. Everythings cool. Hows your brother treating you? Good. Awesome! His girl's awesome too. You should see how awesome! Your aunt's here too. She wants to say hi. Here you go. Hello? Hi, sister Auntie. Giovanni, out it out. Put your brother on now. Hi, Auntie, you recognized me? I wanted to ask you something. Will you do me a favor? Tomorrow can you take Jonny to the exam? If he goes to a club tonight, he'll forget and your dad will be mad. - Can we go? We're late. - Sure. Is that Princess Sissi? It's Federica. "Can we go? it's late. " - You have to leave her... - Give me the phone! I don't like her. The storeowner's niece was perfect. She was crazy about you. Crazy! Understand? I can't really hear, Auntie. Giovanni, she's a bitch! Give me the damn phone! Ok, bye, Auntie. - She says hi. - Can we go now? Can't I even have a quick word with my nephew? - He's more my son than your nephew! - Your son! Can't I get some peace here? Move it or I'll give you peace! Can't I have a little nap? No, you're always yelling, yelling all the time, and I can't get a wink, not a damn wink! Not a damn wink... He's not ashamed of you, he was just saying that. No, he really said it. My dad said the same: "You won't live that way here. " You've been here 10 years now. And no one's ever come looking for you. He's different. His brother loves him. He does, sweetheart. Awesome! Whose clothes are they? They're our costumes for the drag shows we do. I'm Pink Panther. I'm Lady Queen. And I'm Maya the Bee. Why don't you wear them to Gilez? We can't work dressed like that. Why not, sisters? There's only one place for us at Gilez... The kitchen! Useless... Tonight, Insomnia is taking you to the legendary Gilez club to meet... To the cry of "We are", let's meet... That sucks. ...The legendary Jonny Groove! Look at him... We're going to interview Jonny Groove. I found him. I invented Jerry Grug. Jonny. As the king of Gilez, you have loads of female admirers? Sure, but I have a girl, sister. Breaking news: he has a girl! That's quite a scoop! What's her name? I don't know - I call her One Night. - Like the perfume. I never thought of that. Why One Night, Jonny? Because I saw her one night only. She waved to me like this and I knew she was my girl. Great! We're really curious now. Tell us what she's like. Beautiful. Her eyes? Beautiful. - Her hair? - Beautiful. - You know her? - No. Why can't I find her? Let me take care of it. If the gin with beautiful eyes and beautiful hair is watching this, come down here, Jonny Groove's waiting for you! At Gilez. Beautiful... Cut it out, Camilla. A phenomenon! I have to thank Jerry Grups. Jonny. Same difference. Start with my close-up then slowly reveal the place, show the atmosphere here... Then swish pan and track in on the key area of the club. Soda pop is the real new thing here! And it's all down to this guy who's changed the rules of the game! - Jolly Groove! - Jonny. He's as thick as a brick! He said something really important. Jonny, let's send a message to young clubbers Sure, give me the number. No, not like that. Let's say something. Ok. Bros, this is important. Go dancing, have fun, have a blast every night! But when you leave the club, bros, keep your wits about you and do what I do! Get your hand-stamp or you can't get back in! Get your hand-stamp... The guy's too much. Fuck this! You're listening to Radio DJ Nicola who's hot, hot, hot on this hot summer day. Good morning. - Hows it going? - Fine. You got your hand-stamp last night? What hand-stamp? Ah, the hand-stamp! You saw me on TV last night? Yeah, I was clowning around as usual. You know the way I am now You see me in this suit but it's not a suit, it's a shell. This tie is a noose that imprisons my instinct. My instinct that wants to fly free like a falcon in Wyoming. But I'm forced to be here. Why the strange look'? You think I'm mad? But I'm not mad. I'm a free spirit. If I don't want to go to the office, I don't. Yes, that's the way I am. When I want to do something, I do it. Too bad you have to work, Alice, or I'd take you... Where would you like to go? To the sea. I'd take you to the sea but you have to work. It's ok, I can hold the fort here. What are your bosses going to say? They're not here. They'll be back. They're in Rome, auditioning for Big Brother. Big Brother'? Until tomorrow - They're here all year... - But not today! What an incredible coincidence... it's beautiful. So, if we wanted, you and I could take off just like that. So let's do it! Who needs a bill? This is between you and me. Outflow and inflow... We don't discuss this over the phone. Yes, that's fine. What a loser, that guy... Talking of losers, where's your guy? Give him a minute, Dad. I want his Crazy Pizza campaign. Where is he? He was working all night. He's totally committed. He'll soon be here with a big surprise. What surprise? We're not selling Kinder eggs. We're selling pizza, ok! Pizza isn't the same as... Are you listening? Is it that cold? Hi, Fede... I had to come to Genoa. My aunt was taken ill. I'm in this really grim hospital... Coconut! - Coconut. - Streptococcus, the doctor says... - Thanks, doctor. - Coconut! Sorry... I'm coming, doctor. Sorry I have to go. He took her to the sea. He took her to the sea! - How do I look? - Great. - A swim? - Sure. It's freezing! Giovanni, come on, it's beautiful! A shark! Screw you, moron! - What a great day. - Better than the bar. Know who you remind me of? - Who? - My granddad. Your granddad? He brought me to the sea as a girl. I thought you meant physically. No, he was more handsome. I'm kidding! There are no men like him now. Every guy I've ever met was a shit. Especially my ex. - Why? - Because he was cheating on me! "If there's someone else, tell me! "You're so slimy tell me!" My only regret is that I didn't kick him hard in the balls. Giovanni, are you ok? I'm suffering for that guy. You see how he's using his fist? He'll break it that way. I was a junior judo champ. - I don't believe you. - You don't? I'll show you then. I'll show you? I'll show you then. You don't believe me? I'll show you. If you strike like this, you'll break your wrist. You need to twist your body, torso straight, nice and loose, eye on the barycenter right here... When you're powered up, let all hell loose! - Oh, God! - Damn, what a blow! I thought you were the ball. A little ice will ease the pain. Bye! A little ice... Hold on a second. I'll give you a little ice! Faster! Damn, I'll get you! He's gone... - You're really funny - Why? I don't know but you make me laugh. You'll laugh if that Minotaur finds me here. Anyhow, he's gone. So what do we do now? Ask the crocodile. You know how? It's not easy for me to trust a guy. I don't know... What would Jonny say now? Right now, Jonny would probably say... Jonny... Oh God, Jonny. Oh no, bummer! The exam! Where did you sleep? I'm not talkin' to you, I'm mad. Sorry I've been a real... Shit. You said you were ashamed of me! I was wrong, I'm sorry. I was wrong. I was wrong about everything. My life here's wrong. Should I be working for a guy who weekends in Monte Carlo? Or Federica nagging me about staying in... She busts my balls over that Latin American shit. You said "Latin American"! I'm an engineer but I work in advertising! I have to sell that gross pizza. They want to launch it? I'd launch it right out the window! That's howl like to see you. Truce? Ok, bro, truce. Did you study for this? It's important for Dad. No, I'll copy from someone. Copy? it's an oral! That's what I forgot. Take the next right, then pull up outside the barracks. What's an oral? Here I go, bro. You can't got to an exam like that. I didn't have time for the tannin' zalon. Tanning salon... Just put this on, ok. Nice! Ok, Jonny remember. Focus and blow them away. You can be number one. So nice. Come back after. Don't go out on the town. What if the ish gin gets mad? If she does, don't worry, I'll handle her. - Know what? - What? You're awesome, bro! The barracks is the other way. I'm confused. Seventy and seven in. 'Scuse me, bros, can I come in? I put down cards, we're even. Vemia? Hello. Come in. - Hi, bros. - Have a seat. Hi, bro. Friendly kid, huh? I'm Marshal Di Prima. I'm Marshal Di Prima. The primer? He has a sense of humor! The force needs new blood. - Right. - Absolutely All right then... I feel like changing how we do this. After all, it's obvious this young man has studied. So... Do you smoke? He said he doesn't smoke. Leave the cap alone, Jonny. Leave it alone. Jonny, do you drink'? No. Only soda pop. He only drinks soda pop. Leave the cap alone. It breaks otherwise. You broke it. I'll have to get it stitched back on. Nice and easy... I would say that'll do. What more do we want to know? We need healthy elements on the force. You know the Tax Police? You bet I do, bro. They live in the woods, have a blast... We build tires, go into the woods... - How's it going in here? - Very well. A total blast, bro. We've finished with him and it all went beautifully. Are these yours? - You bet, bro. - Fake. You bet, bro! I never buy originals. This pair cost 5 euros. They're 200 in stores. Are you nuts? The boy knows a bargain, he's smart. Smart, economical... Bravo. Can I ask a question? Why? Why ask another question? Vile have other applicants. I'd dismiss Jonny Jonny? His first name? You know him? He mentioned a primer but he never gave me one. What a sense of humor. I'm Marshal Di Prima. Get the joke? Marshal Di Prima! I know who you are, bro. You're my dad's friend. He told me, "Take the exam, he'll pass you for sure.

All right, let's ask this friendly guy a really simple question. - Come on. - Let's. What is the Personal Income Tax rate? That's a tough one. - We don't know. - After all, there were times when I didn't know it myself. It happens. A simpler question then. Much simpler. What does 730 call to mind? What? What's 7 and 30? When... When? What does 7 and 30 mean to you? I know! - He knows! - I know Ok, bros, 7:30 is the happy hour. But don't go then. No one goes at 7:30. Go at 8:30 with the hot babes. What do hot babes have to do with it? Hot babes are always involved. You don't know 730, you don't know tax rates... What about IVA (=VAT)? - You know her? - Who? - Iva, his son. - What do you mean?

I've had it with these goddam watches! Enough! I want to get ahead on my own! Is that clear? What have you done? You destroyed the birthday gm. from my wife! Go, Vernia. Just go. Was the restaurant Gino's'? Out! Only Jonny is still the same. No doubt about it, Rome's beautiful. - It's wonderful. - Fantastic. Fantastic but shabby. Look, that place is full of holes, a ruin. Why don't they knock it down and build a great club? That's Italy. The guys in power don't give a damn. To my mother I know him, I want to say hello! - Sure. - Let go of me! Where are you? Wait till I get you... They took everything. I'm poor. Join the club, pal. Know where to put the roses? This'll blow you away! Damn, if I catch you... Crazy Pizza, the pizza to eat on the fly! You're totally nuts. Holy Madonna! Vote to decide who joins the house, Tonino or Peppino! Phone in your votes, guys. I'll give you ice if I catch you! Sony, pal. Regards to the Marshal.
