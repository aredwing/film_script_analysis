Cold sweat, heart palpitations, shortness of breath. Please, specify your name, sir? Alex Green. The military took me to one a mobile hospital. I saw dead bodies in the hallways. Some of them have been shot, Directly in the head. I think I opened my eyes too early. I do not know how long I tied on the bed, I do not know what could out of that hole. You said he woke up on the way over here? Forget what you saw. This is an elephant tranquilizer, cause hallucinations in patients. We see the results, this would not kill him. Do you know? Each of the first dose not working, can kill you. So congratulations' son, you successfully overcome. Then I was transferred to a civilian hospital. And that's where I met with Kate. So ... ... Six years ago, I have returned. I want you to know because is correct and up to date. I think, you should know. - Thank you. - See you next month. Let's get out of here! Get back here! Please, do not hurt me. I want to remain normal. Do not hurt me. If not injected within a period of 36 hours, the spread of the virus in the body become unbalanced . These statistics are undeniable, not the case single to prove otherwise. And we all know the consequences. We do not have an official number compared with the first outbreak. But most of us have experienced at least one case. However, we believe there's millions deaths worldwide. Outbreaks can not be compared to the tragedy Other known in modern history Trauma is what drives us to start looking for solutions. And ten years later, the protein of "Who Came Back", is a great gift to the people humans are commendable. So, after the outbreak The second inevitable. we were able to save many people. "That Has Back" is a person who ever contracting the virus and suffering, but at the same time good luck large has addressed immediately. As you know, the virus is still there. We can not turn it off. For now. But now at least we can control if it arrives on time. Protein "That Has Back" as barrier, as a retaining wall. The virus is still there, but the daily dose keep it at a safe distance. This problem of lack of natural proteins, ended with the creation of synthetic alternatives. It will be a long treatment infected for life, guaranteed. Cutting funding from private would be a disaster, believe me. For "Who Came Back" is, of course, but for society as a whole. Yes, but there are two things awkward. Please, everyone is free express an opinion. You are very friendly. These people, is a time bomb. Before we found the protein synthetic, they are a threat. If the first dose is skipped. One: there's no way back. Precisely that is why we need to continue to investigate. True, and this treatment is very expensive, which takes up all of their lives. Yes, I do not deny it, but face another epidemic like 20 years ago ... - There are alternatives. - ... It would be much more expensive for everyone. There are other alternatives. Please share with us. That could put them live in special camps, Outside the city, far of the children. - Or we could destroy it. - I do not say it. But you think about it. Therefore, get rid of smokers, diabetics, and obesity as us. I mean, besides we need many costs, too unpleasant. Well, that was ... different. Too harsh? No, no, no, you just Just call it "Fat dumb". He was stupid, is so fat, and now I have prejudice against fat people. Yes, among others. He thought he had a lot of money? Who? The Fat idiot? No. Fuck him, everyone is so meaningful because you are very attractive, right? Correct me if I'm wrong, but natural proteins can be extracted only spinal fluid of infected of those who have died. Fortunately there is little "That Has Back" But it also means a lack of resources from which to extract the protein. Exactly, this vicious circle, so "That Has Back" both protein deficiency. This has led to restrictions imposed in access to treatment, consequence of this restriction, is what worries the government, especially after tensions in recent weeks. - Please fill $ 60. - My father in, pay it there. - $ 60. - Good. BACK Thank you. All right, everyone, good music. I come to work nights, no food in the oven. I love you. Damn, just spent half night, I am not accustomed to shift work. Get used to now, only three shift, your turn is almost complete. I know. That's perfect. I mean, I think Tristan and Josh can go home early. I hope, Josh here in a long time. Where are you going? Close to the wall. You! there. Come on! Calm and silent, there is no relationship with you. It is, thanks. You must have nerves of steel to take care of the zombies, right? Why are you crying and shaking? There are no zombies, meraka "That Has Back". What did you say? Listen bitch, because it seems You do not understand my language. They are zombies. Is that clear? They are not zombies. They are zombies. Repeat again! I'm telling you, they are not zombies. And I say they were zombies. Repeat again, bitch. Come on, tell me. Fine, I'll put a bullet in This bitch's head. Tell. They are not zombies. Forget them! We have to get out of here! It's your lucky day. - Do not move a fucking muscle, it is clear? - Let's get out of here! Who is responsible? I ... Oh, God ... I ... I have never seen something like this. This is the first time. Unfortunately. Let's take a look A video recording. I told you, they wearing a mask. Sabentar again will come reporters vultures (scavengers). There is nothing more they like rather than a piece of fresh meat. Go home. Yes, thank you. What is it? Honey, it's okay. Unfortunately, all is fine. Network what? That's what we do not know, and they do not have leadership However, many people firmly condemned this action. Network "Anti That Has Back" condemned the criminal acts such as last night, we always did. Yes, but never before we have seen that good action. What do you think causes increase in these attacks? - Fear. - And fear justify such barbarity? Do not cut off my sentence. That's right, the Department of Health to control most of the "Who Came Back", but we also know there are loopholes in the system. There are a bunch of out of control physicians, such as the homeless, for example. - And they are tolerant to the protein. - Yes, like that, exactly. Do you remember what happened when "Who Came Back" stop taking their daily dose without warning? In less than 24 hours without treatment of the person attacked five people. He killed them all. Crazy people, crazy fucking commit suicide. Do you think the scale is justified thousand people ... Yes, God .. All right, calm down. So, how long rest? - One month. - A month? Kate, I need you, you're the best doctor. Please at least tell me you will ensure fundraising conference alright. Please. No, it's not going to stop. Thank you God. Are they kidding?

Yes, go up the stairs apartment No.. 4, there the words "Administrator" on the door. - There is the view when you entered? - Not. I mean, I do not know for sure. So, next time be sure, just in case. Yes? After the attacks of that day, I can not be much of a hospital. So I no longer think there again. For two-class women, like us, do business. Is there anything else? I mean money is not a problem. Yes, of course. But realize too risk taking inventory. Only I can take few at a time. We have not received letter from the lab this week. What? Other hospitals also so .. How long have you been careful? There is one month. Can you get me again next week, please? I'll pay whatever. Please. Well, I can not guarantee it, but I'll try. It will cost you four times more current. I say money is not an issue. Well, give me a few days. Thank you. Is this you? Are you one of the they "That Has Back"? The bastard did not just kill the damn thing them, but also take notes. All patient records? Taking the hard drive as well, therein no address, phone number. All that you have good for them. So if you're one of them, be careful. Thank you. Hey, buddy! - What are you doing here? - Talk to you. - Succeeding with the glasses? - You like? Yes, very sophisticated. I do not want people I think advanced. This is false. I'm kidding, what are you so one of those people? I'm one of them. Want a drink? - Always. - Let's go to Spendler. Spendler, whatever.

Are you okay? Do not worry, it's finished. Dispose. We had to call the police. No, we are fine, they will ask questions, and draw conclusions? - So "That Has Back" is not a crime. - Yes, but it could be a problem. Calm down. Come on! entire press comes ... ... press conference, the Minister of Health of guessed there would be an announcement authorized temporary suspension distribution of protein for "That Has Back". " "There is no reason to worry" Has Back ", a temporary regulation, and all state resources that work well. Officers our facilities specially designed, for all emergencies and ensure that all affected can be a viable treatment. This announcement has rocked the community, afraid that this situation will lead to The new outbreak is not under control and Government accepted serious response.
