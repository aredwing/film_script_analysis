Mmne there'll put 'em aside for you for a favour. You needn't get yourself worked up. The papers... they're her love letters. But it's off to the mines for the rest. They don't have your biceps, they don't turn on the dames. In this life, if ya can't seduce, you gotta sweat. You, you gotta sweat. l'm old and ugly...'m I tiring you? No... you're giving me the shits. There's your hundred... you could say 'thanks'. Thanks. You could say 'good day'. Good day, thank you and goodbye. - Gimme 50. - Pascal! What? I see you a lot. Twice a day, anyway. I wasn't talking about here, but in general. For tonight l've made 'boeuf-miroton'. If that grabs you... Boeuf-miroton? Right now I can't... l'm getting fat rolls. You know I could help you lose them... you wanna hear that don't you... You're a skunk. You don't really mean it! Hey, Mmne... My fifty? Auguste, will you check my sprocket.... my chain's jumping. Can't do it today. Tomorrow alright? Yes...but l'm counting on you. Understood. Cheerio. Get your latest "France-Soir"! "France-Soir"... final! There you are sir. Thank you. Get your latest "France-Soir"! Madame... "France-Soir". Monsieur. Get your latest "France-Soir"! "France-Soir"! "France-Soir", madame. I can't change that much. I don't have any change. It's the same for both of us. You keep your paper and l'll keep mine. Hey! "France-Soir". There you are. You wanna take a "Le Monde" as well? Then you'll know all the news. Why not? You wanna lift? No thanks. Cheers, Pascal. Cheers. Ah! Come on! Come on! Here! l'm cold. It's a bit breezy. Come out into the sun. There, that feel better? l'm still cold. You've just been cavorting in the drink... you're a scream, you are! What's happened to make you do this? If I were to tell you, you wouldn't believe me. Come away! Come back under the bridge! You don't look as if you like the pigs. What've you done to upset them? You robbed a bank... or what? You'd ridicule me if you knew. If I knew what? What someone did to me. Who? A woman. You jumped in because of a woman? Yes. So now let's fix you up. Take it off. Hurry up. Turn around. Hold it. Gimme ya shirt and put this on. Thanks. Wanna smoke? No thanks. Still cold? No, but l'm hungry. You're not backward in coming forward. You say when you're cold.. you say when you're hungry. For someone else to fix. So now l'm s'posed to feed you? l've had nothing to eat for two days. Don't complain... ...you'll avoid indigestion. So, what... you're broke? Yes. I don't know anyone in Paris. I came from my place. Where's your place? Puisaye, in Creuse province. What'd you do there? Battery chickens? Battery chickens? I was a land-owner. Wha..? land-owner? You kidding me? I don't have any money, but I do have property, my good fellow. Property... Believe it or not, my good fellow, I can't stand your type. So, fuck off back into the drink... or sell your estates. There's 500. Get yourself something to eat so I don't need to see you again. You shouldn't've pulled me out of the drink then! Alright... come along. Raymond! Hey, Raymond! Come on. Hi, can you give us a lift? Of course. Righto, loser from Creuse... get up on the back. Shove over, make room and open the door. Your bike broken down again? Oh, it's always the chain. Mademoiselle... - Don't forget my leeks. Pardon, Paulette. Your calf's head, Monsieu Pascal, and one leeks. Could you pass me the pepper. Thanks. What you waiting for? Aren't hungry? OK.. so leeks aren't a fun dish. That goes for the rest the way l'm thinking... Ah yeah? And just what are you thinking, might I ask? About her. You're not thinking of starting again! You might think it's a joke, but for me it's serious. Mealtime...that's what's serious. And occasionally... screwing, but you don't have to drown yourself over it. What's she got more than any others? She's mine. You wanna pledge your troth in front of the mayor? Yes. Oh...excuse me. You can't know what a bitch she is. Paulette! Yes? My wine. Coming. You don't give a damn. No, not really. l'll tell you anyway. You've got a right to know. Bon apptit, Pascal. If it'll make you happy... I knew her down there, at Puisaye. She wasn't like the others. She was from town....Aubusson. Your talking about quite a place. I hadn't experienced her style of dress...her makeup. I spotted her right away. Same with her... except that she'd spotted my farm-houses, my barns, my cows. No. Well, she knew just what it was worth. She was beautiful. To make a long story short, you humped her, right? It wasn't that simple. With her, nothing's simple. At first...l'd have to marry her. She had principles. And you'd have been more of the immoral type, a bit of a lad? Go on. Paulette, a bit of pie on the side. l'd been happy for just 8 hours when the brother-in-law turned up. Her brother-in-law... a total arsehole. They did everything possible to drive me nuts, iand they succeeded. Don't get worked up. Have a drink. You don't believe me? No...I do...come on, drink. They had it in their heads that I should sell up everything to come and settle in Paris. They would have taken everything and put me out of business for ever. I realised too late. Paulette, do you have any more apricots? No, they're finished. OK...leave it...that'll be OK. Every time I got angry, the brother-in-law made an issue of it. He made me fly off the handle in front of other people. In front of the lawyer, the priest. People started treating me as if I had something wrong with me. One day, they pulled out all the stops and had a doctor come from Paris. Did he fit this story? Yes, he was a mental specialist. He started to talk about treatment. Bro-in-law said: "That'll relieve Catherine." The slut agreed. I just had time to beat it. Well...tell me... You wanted to drown yourself over that? There was a lot too it. You don't know what it's like if you've never had someone try and lock you up. Not yet. But if I hang around you for long, it'll happen pretty soon. OK...time to beat it.. Aren't we paying? I pay weekly here If your paying, l'll give you back your 500. For tomorrow, what're you gonna do? 'Bye, Paulette. 'Bye. Cheers, Maurice. See you, Pascal. This is where I live. Fine, l'll give you back your jumper. You dunno where to sleep, eh? No. Come on. It's great what you're doing for me, my good fellow. Don't call me your good fellow, I don't like it. Fair enough. Your name's Pascal? Yes, but all the wheelbarrow jokes have already been done. l'm Didier Barrachet. Didier, OK with you? OK with me? It sweeps me off my feet! Better than that, it transports me. Hang on, we're there. This is it. There's only one bed? It's not a dormitory. You'll sleep on the floor. You get the bargain 'cause my bed's hard. There are broken springs in the middle Sleep 'round the clock and tomorrow you'll be a new man. Hoy!... So whadda you think? That I should have killed them. You're going to get that idea out of your head right away. You don't know what they've done to me, Pascal! Ah, those hustlers! Every day they came up with a new trick to make me mad. I couldn't take it any more They've taken everything. l've got nothing left. l'm not talking about money, but about myself. My habits, my delights. Hunting for example. You wouldn't know what it's like, but I lived for it. Down there at Puisaye, it's teeming with partridges. l'd go out in the morning with my dog... ...and my gun, an over-and-under... a marvel. But the slut hid it from me to make me believe I was losing my head. So, l'm... Hang on, do you think you should go to bed? Go to bed and never wake up. Wrap yourself around a shot of this and you'll be out like a light. Drink, that's an order Go on... drink it! Pascal? What? You were wrong to pull me out of the Seine. Oh no!...now l've really had enough! l'm not a Good Samaritan who can put up with anything! So if you wanna be stubborn... ...it's easy, the way out is free! What you waiting for? Jump! You're on the seventh floor... ...you won't fail this time! So jump! Nothing more to say, eh? Instead of hiding your gun, they should have used it on you. Then I never would've met you. If your wife lived with you for 8 days, great. For me 2 hours are too much. Where are you going? Somewhere where you're not. If you're still there tomorrow you go down the 7 floors. Think about it and sleep well. Who is it? It's me. Just a sec. You gonna open? If you aren't alone, just say so. You dummy! What took you so long? I was washing my hair. You've been doing your chores eh?. I wasn't expecting you. When I do expect you, you don't turn up. What's up? You seem a bit strange. Yes, you amaze me. Weird, eh. Work trouble? No, not at work. I pulled a guy outta the Seine. Whaat? And on top of that, he's home at my place in my bed. Ah... so that's why your here? Coz you haven't got a bed. Thank's anyway. Cut it out, l've had enough shit. You eaten? Yeah. Well...tell me 'bout it. How'd it happen? Sure... later on, eh? What's that about? It's from Marilou's place ...2nd door on the right Her sailor's got 3 days leave. It's lively. It seems so. According Marilou, he has a famous temperament. It's the sea air. It's a tonic. My dingbat might never leave. We should rent a house for August for the month. Eh? Where? By the sea. A la mer... l'm saying that for you. Will they finish soon? l've got used to it since yesterday. Pratique, pour dormir. If your feeling drowsy... ...it's best... ...we go to bed. You thinking about your loonie? Oui. l'm wondering if he really is so crazy. If he was, he would've jumped, and l'd be in deep shit. Jumped...where? Out the window. Well you both have something to be happy about. Are you sure he hasn't held out on you? Maybe. But he unnerves me, I like normal people. You haven't even hugged me. One thing for sure about you, you're normal. - I wanna breathe...you hear me? - It's late. - I don't give a fuck if it's late! It's imposible... they doing this on purpose or what? Hey sailor, you gonna carry on all night? God! What are you doing? l'm scared stiff. What? Scared stiff! Cheers, Louis. Cheers. You in a rush?! For once... that OK with you? Ah OK... OK... 'Morning, Mmne. Why the long face? You're very affectionate today. Your speedy departure... because of your nutter? No... forgot to turn off the gas... ...l'll explain... Fine. Here's your 100. No, today l'm taking double. You wanna make your fortune? Exactly. You coming to eat tonight? l'll come back when the sailor's gone. You lousy shit! She's yours. Thanks. Fifty, Mmne. Don't hold them like that. Put them on your arm like this. Always a hand free for the change. There...you've got it. That's it? No, otherwise anyone could do it. You sell by shouting. You can't just shout anything. It's: "Get your "France-Soir"!" Like everyone in Paris was after the rag. How much can I make? Well... To start, What d'you make? Depends on the events at the time. Sputnik, the Tour de France, wars: you can double your month's take. Wow! See what can happen... you can stop thinking about hunting! No way. I'll take you to Alma, I'm sure that'll work out. You think so? I'm telling you. "France-Soir"? No, thanks. "France-Soir"? "France-Soir"! Latest news! there, monsieur. "France-Soir"? Get your "France-Soir"! All the late news! There you are. Get your "France-Soir"! Get your "France-Soir"... Give me"France-Soir". Gimme "France-Soir". Thanks. Thanks very much. - Get your "France-Soir"! Latest news! Latest news! Get your "France-Soir"! "France-Soir" latest! All the news! Get your "France-Soir"! All the latest news! What's happened? You haven't sold them all...? She just passed! There, the grey Peugeot, it's her! Who's "her"? My wife! But I thought your wife was back in your hometown. She came to my place with the bro-in-law! Your place? Yes! You've got your own place? Of course. If you knew where to sleep, why all the carryings-on yesterday? To be alone. You never told me about it! I'm sure I did. No, you told me about your sister not about that. No... I told you at the restaurant. You weren't listening to me... you were stuffing yourself. Didier, look me in the eye and answer me. Just where is this house? At Passy. At Passy. Yes. But I don't wanna to go there! They'll take me off to 'St Anne's'. D'you ever stop talking crap! So...this is crap..eh? These are the keys to my house. Okay. We'll go and visit your house. And your wife, and your bro-in-law. Right now... I wanna see everything. If it's not true, you'll be out on your ear. The car... it's her... like I told you. All this... is really yours? Yes, my good fellow. All mine. Come on... let's go in. No. Whadda you got to lose? Strait-jackets. That's all those two dream about. Pascal, wait. Listen to me, Didier. Listen well. If anyone tries to hurt you, I'll be in there. I can handle your wife. And the brother-in-law? Him too, if he's real. If it's still bullshit... Come on. No. As you wish. Anyone here? Anyone? Monsieur? Who are you? Are you Madame Barrachet? Yes... Madame Catherine Barrachet? Yes...but that doesn't explain what you're doing here Excuse me, but...so...you're Didier's wife? What's happened to him? Has Didier had an accident? No, rest assured, madame. But... as it happens, your husband did in fact try to kill himself. He threw himself into the Seine. He almost drowned. I managed to get him out right away. Thank you for saving him. But saved him for just how long? It's the third time he's tried to kill himself. Didier is.. Didier is very sick. Perhaps you've noticed it? We..ll... He's been gone for 48 hours. But where is he? Why isn't he with you? He didn't want to know about it. Understood... Sit down, monsieur. I do assure you I understand nothing at all about him. Whether it's what he says or what he does. He talks all the time about things that don't matter... ...his dog...his hunting...his gun... He's talked about his dog... ...and his hunting? Yes. And probably... ...about his farms in Creuse. To an extent, you know everything. There is no hunting, no estates in Creuse. He hasn't even been there. My husband's a pathological liar, a sort of child. A child who is sometimes terrible. One day... ...he stopped working, and invented a past for himself as a landed gentry. Look at the garden. He calls it his "pasture". Once, he nearly strangled me because a mole had damaged the lawn. He's no doubt told you I want to have him locked up? Well... yes... ...he did say that. So as to seize his property. That's his endless theme-song... ...his property. So listen then..., I'll tell him I've seen him... ...that I've spoken to you... ...and then... Do you want to try and get him to come back? Not tonight of course. But tomorrow. That suits me fine, but... But? Sometimes he says that he's afraid. But he is afraid. If we only knew what... Not so much you... it's his brother-in-law that he doesn't seem to like. Tell him I'm alone. And tell him that I've found his gun. Maybe that'll convince him. Without prejudging what you'll do... ...I can't thank you enough. Please... but there's something I'd still like to ask you. His obsessions, about the gun, the pasture and all that... In your opinion...can he be cured? And you aren't afraid that one day... ...he'll take you for a partridge? Didier is my husband, monsieur... ...but things may in fact end badly. OK then... I'll try. Goodbye, madame. Goodbye, monsieur. Didn't you like it? Wasn't it any good? Yes, but I'm not hungry. Maybe a bit of cheese... goats' perhaps? No thanks. I'll take my dessert home and eat it in bed. You feel woozy? Me too. It's the heat maybe. Maybe it is. See you, Paulette. See you...'bye Didier, it's me, Pascal! Didier, wait for me for God's sake! Stop there! - Don't come near... Don't come near! I know you're on their side. I can tell! Am I boring you? You think I'm a nutcase? You'll finish up making me truly insane. But what were you looking for here? Yes, it's what they want... and you too. I can see in your eyes. You've switched to their side. She's got to you... admit it! Listen, take it easy. What's the matter with you? Better to run off than be frightened. The only thing that saves me's my fear. Those without fear, finish up in a strait-jacket. I'm afraid and I'm getting away. I knew you were going to roll over when the slut opened the window. It's never opened. Everything's dark...on purpose. She opened it to look normal. If everything looked normal, it'd be me who was mad. And you've gone along with it eh? She always leaves me in the dark. Here you are... Didier, listen to me for 2 minutes. You don't think you're imagining things, that you should try and be ...rational? You're going to go back to your place some day? Yes. There, you see. Want one? Whadda you think of that my good fellow? Sorry, you don't like me calling you that, I'm sorry. Angry? I give you the shits, eh? But I do like you. If you like me so much, why do you tell me that stuff. I don't give a fuck if your rich or poor. So what's with all the bullshit? The farms in Creuse, your hunting, all that..., She said it wasn't true? I've been doubting it myself. She got you, I told you that. You still don't believe me? You want proof? I'll give you proof. There! My electoral card! Hard evidence eh?! Well... read the address. Go on!...read it! "Puisaye, Creuse". My hunting licence: "Puisaye, Creuse". And who's that? You recognise me? The gun, my dog... There...and there! Puisaye tax receipt. Who's it addressed to? To Monsieur Barrachet. OK then? I'm gonna finish up in the nut-house! Last time I believed you. Then your good wife. Then you. I just don't get it. You're going to get it, 'cause I'm going back to my place. I want you to believe me. But I won't stay, I'll just get my money. Now you've got money? Yes, I've got money! I didn't have it yesterday 'coz you don't need 400 grand to jump in the river. But it's mine, that money. You listening? Even though they walk past it every day. Whadda you telling me? I've stashed it in a writing desk. An old writing desk in the back room. They'll think it's impossible to open. But the key isn't far away. You know where the key is? I don't give a fuck about your key. I'll tell you anyway, 'coz you're my friend, eh? Yes! It's in the Chinese vase at the side on the right. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes... You don't believe me? No. If I show it to you, will you believe me? I'll just have to go.. I'm going to find it. If those two are there, I still won't fail to get it. Hey! Hang on...I'm coming. Why? You've done enough stupid things as it is. Only... wait... It takes longer to unlock. To help a guy and to do a robbery are not the same thing. This money really is yours? You bet it is! OK then, come on. But after this, you and me...finished. Finished! You're very kind, you know. I'm a mug you mean. Tomorrow I gotta be up at 7 and here I am playing the night prowler. All this...what for?...who for? 'Coz Monsieur needs someone to hold his hand. An I'm playing the nursemaid. I swear to you...what a world! Go on...I'm not gonna take your arm! Shit! Oh, shit! You're making a racket. You got it? You're the limit... out of practice. Gimme that...you're getting on my nerves! You're sure this is it? Yes. Ah...there..come on. Pascal... I'm scared, I'm not going in there. Come on, you're going. I leave the dough but I don't want to see them, 'specially her. We'll go. That's it, and tomorrow you'll have changed your mind. I'm going in...give it to me. Only, I warn you... You pull another stunt like yesterday, so I gotta run after you...that'll be it. The big key's for the back room The desk key's in the vase. Go past the back stairs. Hurry up. I swear I'll wait for you. Promise. Hullo? Come quickly. A burglar's breaking into my house. Madame Barrachet. Ye, yes that's it, Oh, shit! Didier! - Look over there! You come with me! - Raymond! - Hands up. - Hullo, Dumont? Brossard here. I'm at 14 Rue Mandel. It's a crime scene, send the superintendent right away. Send the quack too, and be quick. I think that's it. Sure. 'Evening, superintendent. 'Evening, docteur. I had you called. You've done well, thank you. Pardon, I was at dinner at the Brassac's... ..of The Academy, and Madame. It was sleep-inducing. Those intellectuals talk their heads off. Everything's covered: Gallo-Roman architecture with the lobster... ...Montherlant with the cheese... ...and when the phone rang they were on about Mozart... ...and fresh fruit. Ah, tell me, doctor... ...to what extent is Death your client? My client? You're going a bit far. Multiple wounds to the head caused by a blunt object. Skull fracture, low external bleeding. Death would have been about three quarters of an hour ago. No sign of a struggle. A quick and easy death You didn't find the murder weapon? Yes... pardon, that's my job. Well, thanks doctor. My respects. Are you in support of the 8-hour day? I'm often asked. - Superintendent - Good evening all. Who's the lady? The widow. Madame, please accept my condolences. Superintendent Dodelot. I don't want to have to bother you in this hour of grief. Thank you monsieur. Unfortunately, my duty requires it. Yours too, for that matter. Neither one of us would disagree... ...that this dreadful deed remained unpunished. Let me say... ...do you know drama? In the end it'll be solved. I was just about to go to bed. I was here when I heard a noise in the garden. Specifically at the bottom gate. I turned out the light... Yes, I think I turned out the light. I saw the light under that door. I was terrified... and I called the police. And then... I got up to warn my husband. Pardon...but was your husband already asleep? My husband was an invalid...a nerve case. Sometimes he stayed out at night. Other times he spent a few days in bed. I got up, but my husband wasn't in his bedroom or in the house. I thought he heard the noise and went down by the small kitchen stairs.... That's what must of happened otherwise we would have bumped into each other... ...and I would have stopped him going down. When I think that it's only because of that...! I was coming out of his room or mine, I don't know which... ...when I heard my husband cry out. Not so much a cry as a stifled yell. Then a thud and I ran back down. Yes the outcome is tragically evident. I do thank you madame. Just one question... When you found your husband, was he no longer alive? Alas, yes. Certainly. Madame,I won't keep you any longer. If I may... ...allow me some advice: you should get some sleep. I'm not going to leave my husband. It's very painful, I know... ...but with a crime, an autopsy is inevitable. Your husband's body will be returned to you after the legal formalities. I ask you to call into our offices tomorrow... ...to repeat and sign your declarations. I'll make sure to keep you the shortest possible time. Madame. Brigadier. What's her name again? Madame Barrachet, Catherine Barrachet. Born Jolivet. 28 years old. And him? Didier Barrachet. aged 49 estate owner. What estate? - Pardon... Superintendent, that candlestick... ...which is always on the pedestal table... ...have you moved it? Get it to the lab immediately. This'll be it? Look . Look out for the fingerprints that we've a habit of missing. You've unwittingly identified the murder weapon. Oh, it's horrible. Get some sleep. It'd be a good idea to take a sedative. Looks like a man, using a candlestick. You taking a look? Head wound, fractured skull, instant death, what more is there to know? And then... no..., I'll skip the dinner table. I'd rather see the living...temporary living. Have you taken him away in the van? I was waiting for your instructions. He's there in the back room. As he's here... Not that way, Superintendent. What's going on?! Ssh! How much? - 400,000 francs, a bundle. Ah? The widow's pretty, I thought maybe a crime of passion. Too bad. You make a habit of heinous crimes? What? But i haven't killed anyone! I was coming to find Didier's money. Didier's dead. That's the best yet! This story of madness continues! Didier was waiting for me outside... he didn't dare come in. I'd come with him to stop him doing anything stupid. I shoulda stayed in bed! Well? That's not Didier. I don't know this guy. - However, it's Didier Barrachet. This guy's 20 years older than him. You're starting to irritate me a bit. You were taken with 400,000 francs that you deny having stolen... I haven't stolen them You deny having killed Didier Barrachet. I haven't killed anyone! When you were shown his body, you denied it was Didier Barrachet! That'e the truth! I pulled him out of the river! He wanted to do himself in because of his wife and brother-in-law. He had savings he didn't dare retrieve. He gave me the keys and waited for me at the gate outside. He told me as well that the key to the writing desk was in the Chinese vase. I found it as he told me. He hadn't made it up! Of course this one here won't contradict you. Can't you understand? I'm telling you this guy isn't Didier. Michel, tell Madame Barrachet to please come downstairs. With consideration, please...OK? What do you do for a living? I'm a "crier". A what? Newsagent. Pascal Cazalis, born Sienna, naturalised French age 38. Ah, Sienna... I had a wonderful holiday there 2 years ago. Are you setting me up? Yes, fair enough. In your place I'd have stayed in Italy where the death penalty's abolished. While here... the mandatory chop. Madame, I'm confused... ...but this individual makes out... You recognize him? I saw him here several hours ago. and tell him why. Go on...speak! He came to tell me that he'd saved my husband from drowning. Ah! Didier suffered with acute neurasthenia.. I had already known him to have moments of terrible depression. But at 8 o'clock, when Didier came home... ...he categorically denied this story, and was quite amused by it. Just when did he tell you... ...that he hadn't thrown himself in the drink. Liar! I can swear on something. Didier didn't come home at 8 o'clock... ...then he was with me! Just a moment... When this man came, he wasn't with your husband? No, he was alone. He was waiting for me outside. Already? ...your Didier passing his time waiting for you outside his house. Why didn't he come in? He was afraid. Afraid of what? Of her and her brother-in-law. Superintendent. Rest assured, he said this isn't the same man, . Acording to these allegations... ...by Pascal Cazalis, the victim couldn't be... ...Didier Barrachet. How can you be so cynical? - You've seen this guy there? You say this is your husband? You pretend it's Didier? I beg of you... this is odious. Odious? IT'S DISGUSTING! Calm down. It'll take more than that to make me calm! You trying to drive me crazy?! I knew Didier! I pulled him out of the drink! I'd have been better off with a broken leg. I lived with him two days! I fed him! I put him up!! You can't tell me that's him! It's not possible. What now? This gentleman wants to introduce himself. I wasn't trying to introduce myself, I was coming back, that's all. Catherine... I've just learned. - It's horrible, Philippe. Pardon, monsieur. Would it be indiscrete to know... Philippe Barrachet, the brother-in-law. Well..there you are...the brother-in-law! I invented him too? The brother-in-law, madame's lover, bullshit! It was Didier who told me! The prisoner's 'cuffed! You often get home so late? Every evening, I'm the manager of Circus Zoo. I come home after the show. I live here when we're playing in the general area. Otherwise, wherever we are. Superintendent, unless my presence is indispensable... You can retire. I apologise for not questioning you earlier. I'm going to ask you to please identify the body. That's certainly him. - But 'him'...who? Go on, say it. Say it's Didier. Go on...this is getting comical. Can he be silenced... Can I have my head cut off, right now, as well! The other one played by the rules, but this one's impatient. Superintendent, this is all beyond me... I don't know what's going on. I'm sick of it all. And I'll be taken away and have to go through it all again. I'm tired...I'm falling asleep... . Ah well... good night. Take him away. Michel, take care of it. Certainly. Thank you monsieur... you may go. Fine. Your circus isn't about to leave town? No, we're on the Plaine Saint-Denis until the 18th. We'll be in touch with you within 48 hours. Who was the first of you to enter the back room? Me, superintendent. By which door? That one there? The one in the corridor. The key was in the door? Yes. And the door was shut? Yes... double-locked. It's obvious... The guy's pinched the money from the writing desk... ...he's going out by the loungeroom, and it's there that he's been surprised. It's quite clear. Sergeant, you're the same build as Cazalis. Agreed. Try to get through...under the door. I didn't steal the keys... Didier had them. That makes 20 times I've told you... ... and you're sticking to it. Perhaps one of these keys is something of an enigma. You might at least smile at my jokes. Go back to where this one came from... It was in the vase beside the writing desk. How did you know? Didier told me! I'll repeat that for 20 years! Yes, I forgot, I beg your pardon. Perhaps you also told me, when I wasn't paying attention... ...how, after taking the money, you've left the back room? How? The way I came in... the door opening onto the garden. Then I ran over to the street gate but Didier wasn't there . That was incredible? Yes. I knew we'd finish up agreeing about something. To sum up... will I be forced to believe you? Admit you're not helping me. So...open up... ...tell me who your Didier is...if he exists. Me, I've got a blue-ribbon body. Recognised by the whole family...unquestionable... ...it's only you who persists in disputing it. In favor of who? A ghost, an apparition. A Didier that no one has seen except you. Hundreds of people have seen him... ...when I had him selling papers on the Alma bridge. Passers-by... you call them witnesses? For exemple... ... I'd've liked to talk to your van driver. He's on holidays. And you don't know where, as usual. When the waitress remembers seeing you with a man. she can't remember the day, or describe the man... ...or tell me what he ate. Leeks. Cazalis, I don't blame you but you're getting on my nerves. Come in. Madame Barrachet's statement. - Fine, tell her to come in and sign it. I like the courage of that woman... ...her dignity. Don't you? What I like about her most of all is her freedom. Madame, thank you for coming. Superintendent. I'm just going to ask you to sign your statement. Ah, wait... I see here "wife of Didier Barrachet , landowner. That's enough for me, but the judge will most likely want ... ...as much detail as we can give him. Please, take a seat madame. I'm listening. My husband had inherited some farms and land. About 500 acres. At Puisaye, in Creuse. Yes, at Puisaye, in Creuse. - I thought Puisaye didn't exist. He didn't have any farms, any crops. That your husnad was a... I don't know what... ...someone who makes things up. A pathological liar. That's it, that's how she described him. M. le commissaire... ...must I stay here having this individual questioning my word? No. Thank you for that. It's disagreeable enough as it is. After all... I am free. She said it... she's free. - Be quiet. Why would Madame Barrachet have misled you? Especially as I wasn't accountable to you. You'll never be accountable to anyone, while there are mugs like me to take the rap! You said Puisaye, in Creuse? - Yes superintendent. I'll get you to sign your statement. Your initiale there... ...and there. And your signature there. Thank you... I hope we don't need to bother you any more. I'm at your disposal... ...I'll not budge until the murderer of my husband... ...has been tried. Where's the way out? Through here, madame. According to his neighbours, he's a nice sort of guy. His workmates say the same. At first the people at the paper weren't very cooperative. But they directed me to a Germaine Montillier, known as Mmne. The delivery-counter girl. According to her, Cazalis really had pulled a guy out of the Seine... ...and had put him up. And he'd told her the guy's name was Didier. The problem there is... did Cazalis sleep with her? Ask around ... That's easy, she told the world. So that's out. And the candlestick, what did it reveal? Nothing. The dead man's starting to talk... The autopsy confirmed the first impression. He was 1-65 metres tall and weighed 53 kilos. And it was not done with the candlestick. Ah no? No. Barrachet was a minnow, a weakling. Have you seen him? He would've been knocked out with a slap. That's why the candlestick bothered me. It's too much. However... it was there. Yes, that's why I bothered about it. But I like the killers to be consistent with the murder weapon. Here we have a candlestick... ...and we find someone who seems to go with it. You'll get a taste of my client for a bit. In 2 hours I have to submit the case to the prosecutor. Do you know a Mademoiselle Montillier? You mean Mmne? Yes and no, I sort of know her. You're her lover? Mmne's got nothing do with this business. There's nothing to discuss. Gimme a piece of paper and I'll sign it. Put anything you want on it That'll put an end to it. No having me with a floodlight in my eyes. I'm ready to sign, I'm telling you. Go on with the interrogation. We'll begin at the beginning. Who gave you the keys? A piece of shit. That was a good idea of his, shining a lamp in his eyes. Who gave you the keys? Release him? You're an odd one. There was still a motive. To be honest, your candlestick theory took my fancy... ...but I'd really like a bit more. Ah... but I have just that. Pascal Cazalis came in by the garden gate. He had to open it. How come he wasn't able to open it to get out? Cazalis isn't very cunning, but he's not so stupid... ...as to lock himself in with a body. But if someone had opened the gate for him... ...that someone was able to lock it. That supposes the existence of a third party that we'll call X. Why? Let's call him Didier, for example. This Didier that Cazalis never stops talking about... ...and whom I'm starting to believe in. Do you know who I also believe in about it? Yes. And the wife, eh? - I haven't sawed through the bars. They released me 2 hours ago. And here's where you came to? Yes, but I'm not alone. They came to see me yesterday. I know. Mmne? Yes? I've been a bit worried about you, all this... If you only knew how much I worried... ...from the moment you left. You must be hungry. I've got some cold veal. My meals have been a bit erratic for a while. Gimme a cup of coffee anyway. Did they beat you? No. That wasn't the only thing that surprised me. I've been lucky... the superintendent's a rum bird... He's like a pair of sugar tongs. He's picked up everything. Picked up what? The way that I was set up. Me too... I think I've cottoned on. D'you still think that... Oh... listen...we'll see. D'you know if my bike's ready? No. I'll go and see. You want to ride tonight? Yep. And box, too. I need to get back into shape. It'd be stupid to leave right now and I've had mail from Puisaye. The accounts are blocked until the reading of the will. Yes, we expected that... my brother-in-law'd told me. Someone's at the door. Yes, at the door, I'll have answer it. No, not tonight. That's right...call me tomorrow. Yes, it's me. Get out! Get out this instant! Don't bother calling the police, they're here. You want to see? They've released me, as you can see. That's not possible. It is. What do want with me? How dare you come back here? I haven't come to scream at you or do you any harm. I've just come to find out where my Didier is. Not to give him up to the police, just to explain to me. We know your way of explaining! And what do you mean by "your Didier" I only knew one Didier: my husband. But you're lying, you never stop lying. That's all you do...lie!. The garden, the first time came here you said it was his pasture. At the superintendent's, you said... ...that he had 500 acres at Puisaye, right? Yes, I lied. Ah...as usual! If I could, I'd have lied more. I'd have invented anything. I don't want my husband's killer to get away with 10 years in prison. That requires agreement as to the name of the assassin. it's not complicated... That night, there were 3 in the house. The dead man, you and me. The superintendent doesn't know one thing that I'm sure about... ...that it wasn't me who's killed someone. Then, it's either you... ...or the other dirty slob, the phony crazy who was scared to come in. Oh well, I'll admit it. What? Admit that he exists... you want to know more? How much do you want to know? Well, that's hard to believe... What do I want to know? Along the way I get my balls cut off and I'm not supposed to ask why? I never looked for trouble, I sold papers. That other bastard pretends to drown himself and I get accused. What've I got here with you two..eh? You got together to pull a dirty trick. You were the candlestick and he was the candle. You're nothing but pieces of shit, that's what you are. Really? Repeat that at the trial... ...I'm talking about yours. Don't forget I'll be wearing mourning in the witness box. Don't come near me or I'll scream. Thanks to you... ...I've got guardian angels. Rest assured.... ...women have a chance with me...I never hit them. There's one who won't have the same chance... the brother-in-law. I like 'em big like him...you can hit without killing. He's going to tell me where Didier is! That's ridiculous. You won't find him. Yes I will, at the circus. Oh! I'm going to the circus, you too? Better call the boss. You're right. Good evening, mesdames! Good evening, mesdemoiselles, good evening, messieurs. and scoubidoubidou ha! Good day, I'm very glad to see you. How are things? Good! Good! Listen! Marcel, I'm very happy to see you and I'm going to let you in to a secret... A secet which can make you That interest you? - I guess so, yes. - D'you have 10,000 francs? You put them there...and on your knees. I put them there...and on my knees. Take this funnel, put it on your head and aim through the hole. Your ticket, monsieur. It's forbidden to be here. I want to see Monsieur Barrachet. He's in the stand. Wait for the interval. ...in the funnel you make 10,000 francs, right. Eh? That right? Oh, are you there, Marcel? I'm here. I say...it's too high for throwing the balls. I'll get lower. Encore plus bas. Oh! Even lower! Like that. I can't go any further. You there, Marcel? I'm here. One , two... One, two... Three! Show the gentleman to one side. You can't stay here sir, monsieur. - It's a joke. - Ah...yes? - To catch one...look over there... ...go after one more stupid than you are. You think you'll find one? Looking hard. The first one to go by... I won't miss him. - Good evening, Monsieur Loriot. - He's the first to go by... Wait...don't move. Loriot, come here! You're going to make 10,000 F! Hold the funnel! - 3 balls in the funnel... ...and you earn 10,000 francs. Hop! Hop! and hop! - come over here. What? I have an idea. If you stick the funnel in his trousers? - He's right! It'll be better. It's a good idea. A good idea. So are you there? - I'm here. Oh! Attention... You're there, Monsieur Loriot? I'm here. One! Look! It didn't work with him. I'm not so stupid! It's a regular attraction. There are no rules about playing to the house. On good evenings, Julien does a victory lap. Catch, my good fellow! Whadda you say about that, my good fellow? Whadda you say about that, my good fellow? Catch, my good fellow! Whadda you say about that, my good fellow? Whadda you say about that, my good fellow? That's great, my good fellow! My good fellow! Michel, come with me. What's going on? if I only knew! You guard your prisoners well. Julien, my clown, is being pursued by Cazalis. It's her! it's her! She wanted to take all his money! No! No! It's her! She wanted to take all his money! No! No! Julien! Julien! I'm looking for him too. How long has 'Julien'-'Didier' been your lover? Three years. I'd hoped you would have guessed the motive of his crime earlier. I was only a helpless witness ...a victim of all this. You believe me don't you? We'll see! Take madame in, and take her statement. Just between us, am i stupid? Oh non, boss. Tell that to her, it'll save a lot of time. Pascal, listen to me! When I dropped the keys near the door... ...it was the signal. It's her, Pascal! I didn't want to do it! She must have killed him while you were taking the money. Don't move, Pascal. Piece of shit! Afraid to be alone, eh? I was your friend, eh? Scum! - Pass me the pole...hang on. - Grab it...there. You want another sandwich? Butter? Yes please! You've enough sugar? It's OK. There. Thanks. Doesn't lool like you've lost your appetite after all that? it's still me who gets into a stew the most. There was a bit there I was seeing myself as a widow too. What do you mean you too? Mmne... I recall, I don't know why... ...how could you speak of Didier? I never told you his name. I don't know, i must have read it in the paper. i didn't ask you that. You told the cops I said his name. I saw you in trouble. I don't think we're talking about the same thing. I'm explaining myself badly. Don't get snappy! What?! Let's not just talk about Didier Barrachet but Madame Barrachet too. "Pretty widow aged 30". I read between the lines and saw a caught-in-bed scenario. A husband who surprises his wife's lover can also leave a pretty widow. So I lied to the cops. Did you really think that? Yes. I didn't want to lose you. That woman made me talk too much. Poor Mmne, you can be silly sometimes. But how silly was that! The neighbours are fighting. And so it starts all over again. I've had enough for the day. Tell them to shut up. Not me. They can throw each other out the window... ...that's their business It's just that... other people's business, understand? Back to normal...come on.. The confessions of Catherine Barrachet!
