You know, if this thing works out, it might give our boys all the way from Bataan to Singapore a big lift. And it may pull a lot of Japs back to their islands. - It'll work out, General. - I'm sure it will. Hello. Hello, York? Doolittle. York, I want you to get 24 B-25s with volunteer crews down to Eglin Field as soon as you can. The job will take them out of the country for about three months. Tell them it's a secret mission. They won't know where they're going until they get there. That's right, volunteers. Tell them they're not to talk to anybody. That's an order. I'll join you in a few days. Right. Zero-two-two-four-one to Eglin Tower. Three B-25s request traffic and landing instructions. Go ahead. Army four-one. The left-hand pattern. Wind direction north by northeast. Land on runway number three. There's the field all right. Boy, did you ever see such a wide runway? She's big all right. You could almost close your eyes and get in. And I'd give plenty to know where we go from here. Yeah, so would I. Hey, don't do anything till I get my camera. How does she look from the nose, Clever? Great. Florida, palm trees, alligators, bathing beauties. Hey, Thatcher, have a look at some real country. It's not as pretty as Billings, sir. Did you keep the cookies this trip, Thatcher? Yes, sir. I had a little trouble coming over the mountains, but I hung on. - Zero-two-two-four-one to flight. - Hey, wait a minute. We'll go around, make an echelon right once over the field, then break away. Let's make it pretty. Here's for luck. Switch is off! - 5:25. Not bad time. - Yeah, we moved. Better write that left engine up. She sounded a little rough. Boy, I got some swell shots, Lawson. You really made a nice break away. Gave me kind of an artistic angle. Some day I'll do a crash landing so you can get a real movie. Thatcher says that Florida can't compare to Billings. Trouble with Thatcher is he thinks that any place with more than 300 people - is overcrowded. - Oh, according to the last census, sir, Billings has a population of 16,380. 16,000! Oh, no, Thatcher, you must be thinking of Greater Billings. No, he's right, Clever. They count the cows up in that country. - Sorry, sir. - Yes. - Cameras aren't allowed on the field. - What? That's right, sir. A lot of secret work goes on here, and they're very strict about it. Well, I can't see anything secret from here. Then I'll have to report you to the Commanding Officer, sir. Those are my orders. Okay. Okay. Hey, look, Brick Holstrom's still with us. We were afraid you wouldn't get that turkey in till tomorrow. Why, that baby flies so pretty we floated the last 200 miles. - Are you guys ready? - Yeah. Come on, Brick. Oh, Thatcher, I'll be right back and tell you where your quarters are. Yes, sir. Come on, Davey, you've got an idea. What's the dope? - Where do we go from here? - I already told you. All they said was that it'd take us out of the country, we'd be gone about three months and that it'd be dangerous. Look, I got the real dope from Joe Randall. He says they're forming patrol squadrons to guard the Canal. What's dangerous about Canal patrol? Well, what are we worrying about? Ski will give us all the dope when we check in anyhow. Three ships in, sir. Holstrom, Lawson, and myself. - Good. Your ships okay? - Yes, sir. Sit down. Where we staying, Ski? The government's leased a hotel near here. They call it the Officers' Club. The men whose wives are coming can stay there. The other officers' quarters are in Barracks 5. Is Emmy coming down? - She'll be here in a couple of days. - Where'll I put Thatcher, Ski? The enlisted men are assigned to Barracks 12. Okay. - Anything else? - Nope? At least, not until tomorrow morning. Well, we'll be seeing you. Say, Ski, the guys are all crazy to know what's up. You know as much about it as I do. We may be given more information in the morning. Well, beat me, daddy! Look who's coming! Well, well, well, plant me now and dig me later, if it isn't the pride of Randolph Field. How are you, boy? Great, Shorty. The minute we heard that razzmatazz, we knew you must be somewhere around. - You volunteer for this deal, too? - Sure enough. They had me stationed up in Minneapolis. Coldest country I ever did see. I'd have volunteered for anything to get back in the sunshine. - Where you been? - Columbia, South Carolina. - Bob! - Hello, Ted. You guys know each other? Oh, we just went through Kelly together, that's all. - Sure. Bob was bridesmaid at my wedding. - Wedding? Nobody tells me anything anymore. How long you been balled up and chained down? Six months, in five more days. Well, blow my foot off. Skin me again, boy. Hey, Davey, what are you doing down here? - Brick! - Hi, Don. - I thought you were hunting subs. - Was. Got me one, too. - You in on this deal? - Sure. I've got a swell crew and it looked like it was going to be something, so why not? - Any ideas what we might be up to? - Oh, just a hunch. Yeah? Well, give. South Seas. Knock ourselves off a few meatballs. Yeah? Three. Honest man. Dealer takes two. - You know, I just got an idea. - About what? About where we might be going. The way it looks to... No, that's not right. Forget it. Says two. - You know, I've got an idea too. - Yeah? I've got an idea you're pretty much of a dope to have come in on this deal in the first place. What kind of a crack is that? Oh, I don't know. You're married. You've got a swell girl. I never would have stuck my neck out if I were in your boots. Go away. You say two? And up two. Those guys are off again. Hey, stand up there. Who do you think you are? Have you ever carried a navigator in your ship before, Spike? Neither have I, until I volunteered for this job. Oh, we're going to see some fancy stuff, all right. I kind of got a feeling. Shoot me for a pole cat. Do I see two red-blooded citizens lying on their backsides while the Texas anthem is being rendered? On your feet, men. What are you beefing about, Shorty? You're from Virginia. That's right, sharp cat, but my pal here, he's from Texas, and he takes offense easy. - Hello, Joe. - Hello, Joyce. I've got some news. Hey, you guys, shut up! Quiet, fellows. Listen. Jimmy Doolittle's down here and he's a Lieutenant Colonel now. Jimmy Doolittle! A southern boy from Southern California. Let's have Eyes of Texas for Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle. Attention! Gentlemen, Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle. As you were. You men are here because you've volunteered. You have been told it's a dangerous mission. I can't tell you any more than that now, but I want to emphasize the danger. The most important thing at the moment is secrecy. I don't want you to even tell your wives what you see down here. And if you think you've guessed where you're going, you're probably wrong. But don't even talk about your guess. If the slightest word about this mission gets around, you will endanger not only your own lives, but the lives of thousands of other men. Now I want to ask you a question. Has anybody tried to talk to you about this? Good. If anybody on the field or off the field tries to engage you in conversation as to why you're here, no matter how innocently, I want you to get his name and give it to me and I'll turn it over to the FBI. This is going to be the toughest training you've ever had. You will have the same crew all the way through and the same ship. And the man or the ship that fails will be dropped. You're going to do things with a B-25 you thought were impossible. Now, if any of you have any doubts, I'd like you to drop out right now and I promise you that no one will ever think the worse of you. If you have wives or children or any other considerations that might get on your nerves in a crisis, it's perfectly all right. As a matter of fact, it's your duty to drop out. Very well. We'll have these talks as often as possible. That's all. We're going up this morning for an orientation flight. There are four auxiliary fields. One, two, three, four. Line them up and locate them all. We don't know which we're going to use for our confidential experiments, so familiarize yourselves with all of them. Look over the countryside, and we'll meet here again at 3:30 this afternoon. Are there any questions? Sir, the plugs are being changed in my engines. To save time, may I go along in Jones' ship? Right, Smith. All right. You can go to your ship now. It looks to me like it's going to be a long time before you swing down Main Street of Billings again, Thatcher. In Billings, sir, the main street is Minnesota Avenue. You know, that guy really means business. - He had me sweating a little. - Yeah, me too. - Lieutenant Lawson? - Yes. Someone to see you out in front of the PX at J Street, sir. Thanks. I wonder who would... I'll be right back. Ellen! - Where did you come from? - I drove to Carolina to surprise you. - And then they told me you're down here. - Well, how are you? I'm just fine, thank you. And how are you bearing up? Oh, great. You look just the same. Well, of course I do. You can't expect any change this soon. - What's the joke? - Nothing. Except you're so funny. Tell me, honey, were you surprised? Oh, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here, let me buy you a drink. Gee, I'm glad to see you. Come on, let's go around here. Tell me, honey, how come you're so cute? I had to be if I were going to get such a good looking fellow. You know, there's a lot of things I want to talk over with you. Go ahead. Were you really surprised? Well, no, not exactly. You know, you go into something like this with your eyes open. - Naturally you've got to take your chances. - I see. Isn't that kind of a cold-blooded way to look at it? Oh, now, don't get mad. You've got to be cold-blooded about it. This is the most important thing that's ever happened to me. - What about me? - Well, you're in on it, too. - That's why I want to talk it over. - That's very generous. Go on, Ted. Well, in the first place, we've got to keep it a secret. - I don't want you to tell a soul. - You're not, I mean, you... You don't wish it hadn't happened, do you? Oh, no, of course not. But it's a military secret, I've got my orders. Military... Say, what are you talking about? Well, this job I volunteered for. Didn't you get my letter? - No. Didn't you get mine? - No. Well, I suppose it's very funny, but... - Hey, Lawson! Ted Lawson! - Here. What are you hiding out... - Ellen, when did you get here? - Five minutes ago. How's my bridesmaid? Great. Only I'm going to have to break this up. Doolittle came out to watch us take off. Okay. I'll see you for dinner. There's a hotel about a mile and a half down the road. I haven't seen it yet, but they tell me you can't miss it. - I'll find it. - I'm sorry to have to rush off like this. Don't forget dinner. Say, did anybody pick up a letter for me? Yes, sir. I did this morning. I forgot all about it. - Well, bring it up. - Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. Okay. Thanks. Take over, will you, Davenport. Sure. Hey! I'm going to have a baby! Hey, it's from Ellen. She's going to be... I mean, I'm going to be a father. Hello, flyer. Oh, I'm sorry I woke you up. I wasn't sleeping, really. I was just dozing and thinking. I'm sorry I didn't get back for dinner. We had a lot of checking to do. You must've thought I was an awful dope this morning. But I didn't get your letter until later, so I didn't know. I know. Sit down. - I think it's swell about the baby. - I knew you would. I wasn't a bit worried. You know, it's going to seem funny. I don't care whether it's a boy or a girl. Not that much. I just want you to be okay. It's pretty serious. - Well, what's so funny? - I was just thinking. Here you're getting ready to go off on something really tough, and you're worrying about me. If I were in your spot, I'd be scared to death. - But I guess I am anyhow. - Purely routine stuff, flyer. The kind of job every girl takes on once or twice in her life. Why don't you lie down? You know, Ellen, I'm kind of glad I got you. I guess that's what I was thinking about in my sleep. It almost frightened me. It seemed that I was thinking, "What if I'd never met him?" Well, for one thing you wouldn't be traipsing around the country from one airfield to another trying to catch up with me. And for another, you wouldn't be having a baby right in the middle of a war. Oh, no, it wasn't that. I was thinking that if I hadn't met you, I'd never have felt really close to anybody, never in my whole life. Married six months and together less than two weeks. That's not being as close as I'd figured on. Don't you see, Ted, that's just it. If people can be close when they're far away from each other, well, that's what it should be. Yeah, yeah, I guess so. Cuddle me. I was thinking about last Christmas. The tree we set up in that Portland auto court. - Wasn't it an awful little room? - Yeah. And the Christmas dinner we were planning on. And then you ran out of gas and landed in the mud up in lllwaco, Christmas Eve and Christmas were all over before I saw you again. Yeah, that was tough. But I got a scarf out of it, anyhow. Well, it wasn't exactly as we'd planned it. It was our first Christmas, and somewhere way off, it didn't matter where, I knew I had you. Oh, Ted, it was the nicest Christmas of my life. You were born to marry a flyer, Ellen. I knew that the minute I first saw you. As a matter of fact that's why I married you. - You know, I've got a confession to make. - What? The truth is, you didn't marry me. I married you. Oh, you did, eh? The first time I saw you in the library at LACC, I said to myself, "Oh, oh, that's for me. " And from then on, clear up to the night we got the judge out of bed in that little Idaho town, nothing was an accident, Ted. I planned it that way. - You think you're pretty smart, don't you? - I'm not sure whether I do or not. You see, you didn't put up much of a fight. I suppose you figured out on that baby, too? That's something you'll never know, flyer, you'll never know. Boys are working late these nights. Yes. Do you have any idea how long you'll be gone? But as soon as this job is over, I'm going to ask for a leave. Two, maybe three weeks. We'll have that honeymoon you're always talking about. Yes, just the three of us. Ted. I do hope I don't get big and fat like that lady in Chicago. I want each one of you to know something about the other man's job. The pilots will practice every job on the plane. Navigators will learn the work of bombardiers and so forth. That's in case any of you get shot up. There's one thing more. It is inevitable that some of your planes are going to fall into the hands of the enemy. For this reason, I have ordered your Norden bombsights removed. Captain Greening has designed a sight which will be perfect for our job. If there are no questions, I'll ask Captain York to take over. Just like I said, we patrol off Brazil. Yeah, but what about taking the Norden Bombsight out? There's no chance of falling into the hands of the enemy if you're hunting subs. - I hadn't thought of that. - That Doolittle's a cheerful cuss, isn't he? "Just in case any of us are shot up," a bundle of sunshine. Oh, it's Ted, it's Ted! George used to buzz me when we were first married. He doesn't do it any more. They're not supposed to. - I wonder if he still loves me. - I wouldn't worry about that. Every time Ski gets a new ship he has a terrible love affair with it, but he always comes back to me, especially when he's hungry. Just think, they'll be gone three months. I think I'll get a job in a defense factory. I couldn't stand just sitting around in some little apartment and waiting. What are you going to do, Ellen? Oh, I'm just going to sit around and have a baby. - A baby! - A baby! Ellen, why didn't you tell us? I don't know. I guess I just never thought of a way till now. As it turns out, it wasn't hard to tell at all. Well, I'm going to have one, too. - What? - Really? Gee, I think it's wonderful. George and I have talked about it, but, well, with him away and all, - I guess I'm just too scared. - I thought I would be too, but... Well, Ted and I figured that everything since Pearl Harbor has just been so much velvet. And then I guessed that if anything should happen to him, only I know nothing will, I'd have the baby, and that would be a little bit of Ted still living. I sometimes wonder how we'll feel when it's all over. Just think, being able to settle down in a little house somewhere and raise your children and never be in doubt about anything. We'll probably have exactly the same doubts that we have right now. For example, will he or will he not be home for dinner? We're about to enter the most secret part of our training. This field is patrolled on all sides so no one can disturb you at your work. Gentlemen, this is Lieutenant Miller of the Navy. He's going to instruct you in takeoffs. Instead of the normal B-25 takeoff in 1,500 feet at 90 miles an hour, he's going to show you how to do it with a full load of bombs and gas in 500 feet at 50 miles an hour. You will attempt no short takeoffs from Eglin Field, where people can see you. Lieutenant Miller will also give you a few short talks on naval etiquette. Now, if this gives you any hints as to your destination or as to what kind of work you're going to do, don't even discuss it among yourselves. I'll ask Lieutenant Miller to take over now. Gentlemen, those flags out there are at 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 feet from the starting line. The line down the center of the field is to guide you in your takeoff. The kind of work you're going to do won't permit any deviations. Now, the whole idea is to get up full power before you release your brakes. Then start, at maximum r. p. m., manifold pressure and with your wing flaps all the way down. You'll have to rev your motors until you think they're going to burn up. And then, when they reach the right pitch, and that's a matter of sound and feel more than instruments, release your brakes and hunt for heaven. I don't expect any of you to do it the first time. - Gray. - Yes, sir. Suppose you and Manch try it first? The rest of us will stay on the ground, mark your takeoff and check the wind. Yes, sir. I think at first we can learn as much by watching trial runs as by actually flying the ships. So let's all line up over here and see how he does. - What kind of surface wind, Ski? - Eight miles an hour. He didn't have his engines revved up enough. Lawson, you go next. Now remember, for our purposes, if you get your wheels a foot off the ground, that's good enough. You don't need height, but you've got to get your wheels off before you hit the last flag. A little later we'll try retracting the wheels at around 450 feet and relying on your motors to float the ship. - Don't try that just yet, though. - Right, sir. Now, grab the column and pull her until you feel the inside of your backbone. Yes, sir. Did you ever take off a B-25 at 500 feet, sir? No. But you men will. Don't worry about it. Watch Lawson there. You'll have to rev your motors at least that high and maybe higher. About 700 feet. He burned his tailskid. Didn't pull his wheels up soon enough. Brother, that takeoff was strictly on the cob. That airplane of yours looked exactly like a ruptured duck. How do you like this guy? He takes off like an old lady in a high wind, and then he's got the nerve to talk about a real ship. It's lucky you didn't have a muddy field, or you'd still be there. If I were you I'd worry about that turkey you and Gray are pushing around the sky. - The ruptured duck will get along okay. - Oh, I'm insulted. Come on, fellows. That won't take long to fix, sir. Ruptured duck. Ted. Don't you think Linda's a good name, if it's a girl? Oh, yes, yes, it's fine. No, maybe Nichola. Nichola? That has a nice sound, don't you think? What's that? Oh, yes. Look, honey, we don't have to decide that right now, do we? No. Ted. He wasn't badly hurt, was he? - Who? - Johnny Adams. - How'd you hear about Johnny? - Those things get around. - He wasn't hurt, was he? - Of course not. I don't know how those things get started. Every time a guy does a noseover on this field, it's a crack-up. Ted. You've been working ever since dinner. Come on, let's get some air. It's a deal. Nice. I'm sorry we haven't had more time together, Ellen. We can spare a little. We've got all the rest of our lives. That's right. Something blooming? It smells good, doesn't it? - Ted. - What? Please, don't worry about anything. I'm not worrying, just working, that's all. You know, this is going to be quite a deal. You're not worried about the deal. You're worried because you've got a wife. And that's wrong, Ted. Say, Bob Gray hasn't been trying to scare you, has he? - Of course not. - Okay. Because there's nothing to worry about, nothing. Silly, as if I didn't know that. Besides, if anything did happen, you've got all that government insurance, that'll take care of you and the baby for a long while. Oh, what am I talking about? Nothing's going to happen anyhow. Ted, look at me. That baby and I, we won't ever need anything but you. We mustn't either of us be scared about it, Ted. Because the baby, the baby's why I know you're coming back to us. We'd better make this one, or Shorty'll never let us hear the last of it. Yeah. - Hear those engines? - Like music. Come on, you hopped up bus drivers. It's been 10 weeks work and one night's fun. Let's go. - I got my flaps up, brother. - Heat it up there, Smitty boy. Steam and sizzle. Where you're going, no one's gonna hold you tight. Hey there, Doc, don't you know how to dance? When they start picking flak out of your feet, you'll wish you'd put them to better use. I'm a doctor, not a jitterbug, Shorty. - Hey, what gives? - Shorty's throwing a party. A party? What for? Somebody said he's celebrating Texas Constitution Day. - Texas Constitution Day? - Say, I'm gonna sample this. Grab your gal, Lawson. Don't you know it's Sam Houston's birthday? Sam Houston? For a guy that never saw Texas, that Manch is really sold. - Hi, Lawson. - Hi. How did this riot get started? It's Texas Admission Day. And that ain't no riot, mister, that's a full-fledged war. - Seen Ellen? - I've seen everybody. - Hello, flyer. - My dance? All of them, my boy. Every dance from now on out, including the last one. And I love you, Ski. I love you, I love you, I love you. You know, it's a funny thing. That Lawson used to be about as graceful as a Texas steer. Now, look at him. Maybe the girl's got something to do with it. Ah, you said it that time, Clever. You know, there's something I mean to tell you more often, - but I never seem to get the chance. - What is it? Just that I love you. I got a letter from your mother this morning. Forgot to tell you. She said to take good care of you. - How am I doing? - Better than mother ever dreamed of. Here. Here. Now smile and sing. Ted. Telephone's ringing. - Telephone, Ted. - Oh, sure. Yeah? Right now? Okay. Okay. Okay. What was it? Oh, just another night call. But what a night. I'm sorry. What time is it? 3:10. - Hung-over maybe a little? - Oh, just a headache. - I'm not used to party life. - Poor baby. You go to sleep. I'll be back by breakfast time. I'm so sleepy. Goodnight, darling. Or rather, good morning. Boy, if I ever get a leave, I'm going to sleep for six days solid. I wonder what this is. Well, men, your ships are all serviced, gassed, and ready to go. You will take off in shifts, the first shift taking off in 45 minutes. Captain York will give you your clearances. Now there's one thing that must be thoroughly understood. After you take off this morning, you are to see no one, speak to no one, telephone no one, not even your wife. There are no exceptions. Continue your gas consumption tests to your destination. Now, the work you will be asked to do will require a little low altitude flying, so hedge-hopping on this trip is perfectly okay. Only bear in mind that cowboys wear pretty tall hats, so watch your step, men. That's all. I think you're very well prepared for what you volunteered to do and I want to thank you for a lot of good hard work. I'll see you in a few days. Good luck. I hope I get a chance to tell Ellen goodbye. Yeah, you will. Your destination is Alameda field. Take the southern route, refuel at San Antonio and march. As your names are called you can start. First flight, Holstrom, Jones, Lawson. Second flight... - Ted. - Well, this is it, honey. We're off. - How soon? - Just got time to pack. Where's my B-4 bag? - In the closet. I'll get it. - Good. Socks, shirts. - My ties in the closet? - Yes, I have them. Good. Wow! Don't go in there in your bare feet, I broke a glass. All right. - You forgot your toothbrush. - Oh, doggone it. - We got everything? - I think so. Swell. Well, be a good girl and take good care of that baby. - I will, Ted. - Yourself, too. Oh, Ted, I'm going to write you a letter every day you're gone, I know they won't deliver them. I won't even mail them. But I'm going to write just the same. That way, we'll kind of be in touch. That way, we'll feel close. Goodbye. Bye, flyer. Tell me, honey. How come you're so cute? I had to be if I was gonna get such a good looking fellow. I'll be back. Hey, the Bay Bridge is off to our right. The Bay Bridge is off to our right. The Bay Bridge? How about flying under it? - For why? - Well, so I can get some pictures. You know, shooting up at the superstructure. - Come on, Lawson. - Do you want to? - Sure. Go ahead, if it'll make him happy. - Thanks. I hope there are no cables hanging under that span. Here we go. Let's take a turn and go it again. I forgot to put film in. We're due at the field. Forget it. Oh, I may never get another crack at it. Hey, look. McClure, take a look down there. - It's a carrier. - Yeah. And look at her deck. B-25's. Holy Smoke. Then this is it. Kind of small, isn't she? Pilot to bombardier. Pilot to gunner. Pilot to gunner. Thatcher. Thatcher. It's dead again. We'd better report it to Doolittle when we get in. Yeah, that left engine along with it. Still seem a little rough to you? I can't tell anymore. - Is everything okay on your ship? - Why, yes, sir, yes, sir. Taxi over to the edge of the carrier's wharf. They'll take care of you there. Yes, sir. They don't even wait until a fellow gets out. - All Navy guys are cocky. - Miller's a Navy guy. Well, Miller isn't exactly Navy. He's a pilot. Hey, Spike. - Spike. - Spike, what's the matter? Oh, I put in a beef about my fuel pump and Doolittle told me to take her to the hangar. Well, then you're not going? No, and there's nothing really wrong with that plane. - It's the best ship in the squad. - Boy, that's rough. And I nearly told him about our interphone. You would've been a cooked goose. I think, sir, I'll go and watch those Navy guys. - They might bang her up or something. - That's a good idea. How do you like that? They're going to break the Duck's back sure. How did we get in the clutches of these Navy guys anyhow? - Boy, that's an awful big ship. - Yeah, let's take a look at her. - So long, Spike. - So long, Spike. - Be seeing you, Spike. - Goodbye, fellows. Lieutenant Lawson, reporting aboard, sir. - Bettinger, take Lieutenant Lawson to... - 306, sir. - 306. - This way, sir. See you guys later. Lieutenant McClure, reporting aboard, sir. These are your quarters, sir. Mr. White and Mr. Felton are on shore leave. Thank you. Are you sure you'll be able to find your way back up to the deck, sir? Oh, sure. Thanks. What are you doing down here? Oh, just looking around. What are you doing here? Just looking around. - Are you lost too? - Am I lost? I'm trapped like a rat. I've been walking for miles. This is the biggest cockeyed ship I've ever seen. Yeah. And I wish the deck was twice as big. The smoking lamp is out. The smoking lamp is out. Sir, "The smoking lamp is out" means no smoking anywhere on the ship. - Okay. - Why is that? Because they're refueling, sir. They'll let us know when they're through. Hello. Well, you guys finally got on, huh? Yeah, we've just been looking the tub over. - How are your quarters? - Perfect. Nice room with two bunks and a cot. A cot? Follow me, brothers. I'm gonna show you real quarters. And I mean quarters. Hats. Hats. - Well, look at what's here. - Well, we have guests. What's the idea of bringing people up here from the tenement district? This is jocularly known as the admiral's cabin. Looks like you guys are going to have to start bathing. This isn't all. There's something else. Follow me. I'd be glad to. Careful of the rugs, please. Now just inside, gentlemen, is something to really feast your peepers on. The first guy turns in after dinner gets this bed for the trip. You know who that'll be. Enter. What dirty, lowlife... Come out of there, you boll weevil! Well, feed me corn and watch me grow. How did all this scum get in? And me in an Army cot. That's where he'll end up, before the night's over. - Let's get out of here. - Oh, Lieutenant! When you guys go down to dinner, would you mind bringing back a roast beef sandwich, rare, and a piece of huckleberry pie, Lieutenant. - Well, are you still glad you came along? - Sure. Aren't you? - I've got a funny feeling about this job. - Yeah? I think maybe it isn't going to be as much of a cinch as we figured on. Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing. Well, my ship's over there. I think I'll go take a look at it. Well, the Duck's up ahead. I'll see you in the morning. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Who's that? - That you, Thatcher? - Oh, yes, sir. Oh, forget it, Thatcher. Got her pretty well lashed down, haven't they? Yes, sir. They did a good job. I was kind of worried about her, so I thought I'd better come up and have a look. You lonesome? I guess everybody is a little, sir. Don't bother with the sirs, Dave. Your quarters all right? - Yeah. Fine. - Grub's good, too, isn't it? The best I've had in a long time, sir. What are you going to do when we get back home, Thatcher? Oh, I have a girl in Billings, sir. I'm going to marry her, if we get back. Oh, we'll get back all right. Oh, hello. - Hello. - Hello. I thought I'd come up and shoot the stars for a little while, but I guess it's too foggy. Pretty foggy, all right. - What are you guys doing here? - Oh, just getting a little air. - Yeah, it's pretty stuffy down below. - Yeah, it sure is. You guys worry over the ruptured duck like a bunch of old maids. Me, I'm going to bed. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Ted. Wonderful air, isn't it? The smoking lamp is lit. The smoking lamp is lit. - What's wrong? What happened? - Just battle stations. Around sunup and sundown the pig boats give us a little trouble so we always lay for them. This is Jig White and I'm Bud Felton. - Glad to see you. - Glad to see you. - How are you? - See you later. - Are we underway? - For the last five hours. Glad to have you aboard, Army. General Quarters, man your battle stations. Army personnel, man your planes. Boy, the only way you're going to get that thing off of here is with a crane. Maybe so. But we kind of think we can take off on our own power. Hey, where'd they come from? That's what's known as an escort. They just slipped up on us during the night. The Navy likes to do things quietly. Looks like it's really going to be a show, doesn't it? Boy, did I hate to part skin from sheet this morning. What a bed. Oh, this is Shorty Manch. Jig White and Bud Felton. - Hello. - Hi y'all. This lucky stiff is sleeping in the bedroom off the admiral's cabin. Yeah. Wonderful accommodations, but nothing much to do. I thought there'd at least be a poker game or something going on. Oh, I guess they have them every once in a while. How about Seven-Toed Pete? Do you ever play much of that around here? What's Seven-Toed Pete? Well, it's a kind of seven-card poker. - I'd be glad to teach it to you some time. - Never heard of it. Attention, Army personnel! Attention, Army personnel! Assemble in Ward Room. - See you later, fellows. - Assemble in Ward Room. Well, it's been a great pleasure, fellows. We'll certainly have to get together soon. Maybe we can get up that little game of poker. See you later. You know, I believe that boy wants to play poker. I wonder if they got their pay before they came aboard. As you were. For the benefit of those who haven't already guessed, we're going straight to Japan. The Navy will take us within 400 miles of the Japanese mainland. We're going to bomb Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya. It'll be a night job and you will be given the opportunity of choosing the city you prefer. Now, this is going to be a tight squeeze. The Chinese have prepared small fields just outside of Japanese occupied territory for us to land on after the raid. They'll gas us up and we'll take off for Chungking. From now on we're in constant danger of enemy attack. If there should be a surface attack, stand by your planes with fire extinguishers and let the Navy handle it. If there should be an attack by air, take off and make for the nearest land. The Navy will give all navigators their bearings twice a day. Now once more, I want to emphasize that if... If any of you feel you're not up to this job, it's perfectly all right for you to drop out. We have a few spare men and I think we can fill your place. Get together with Captain York and find out what to do with your planes. We'll meet here tomorrow afternoon at 2:30. Are there any questions? Colonel, do you mind if we smoke during these assemblies? I have no objection to that if the Navy hasn't. Anything else? Dismissed. 48, 49, 50. 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56... Oh, sorry, Manch. - Just getting a little exercise. - Yeah? Well, I wasn't. I'm measuring off this cockeyed deck. Nine... Attention, all personnel. You have been wondering about the mission we are on. I think you might like to know that the Army personnel on the Hornet are going to bomb Japan. We of the Navy are going to take them in as close to the enemy as possible. This is a chance for all of us to give the Japs a dose of their own medicine. It's an Army-Navy show. Let's extend every courtesy to the Army men on the Hornet who are going to do the job. Good luck, good hunting and may God speed us on our mission. Have some? Thanks, buddy. You're awfully lucky for guys who never heard of Seven-Toed Pete. They tell me Virginia's a great hunting country, too. What's that? Oh, yeah. Let's play, fellows. - What's the bet? - It's up to you, Manch. Don't they call Virginia the Mother of Presidents? Yeah. I mean... Bet five. Up ten. Thomas Jefferson lived there, too, didn't he? I drop. A lot of guys lived there. Are you sure you never played Seven-Toed Pete before? Makes it ten to you, Manch. Have they finally gotten that hookworm situation under control down there? There never has been a case of hookworm in Virginia. - I've got a small straight. - Mine's seven to the jack. All pink. Well, that beats. I think I'll turn in. - Somebody's won a lot of dough. - A little. - You just had a run of bad cards, Manch. - Yeah. What say we get together again pretty soon? Oh, sure. See you later. Say, you haven't got any books on Virginia, have you, Manch? You Army guys are real pigeons. I wish you were in the Navy. You take the bunk, Lawson. I'll sleep here, if you don't mind. - What's the idea? - That thing's as soft as a feather bed. I never could sleep in it. Yeah. It's not bad. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Lieutenant Randall is going to tell us something about a carrier takeoff. Mr. Randall. From the minute you're in your planes, I'm the man to watch. Have your engines turning over as soon as the man in front of you starts taxiing. When I want you to rev up, I'll give you this. Now, if your engines don't sound right to me, I may have to keep you revved up longer than you think necessary, I can hear your engines and tell when they're missing better than you can. When I want you to start taxiing, I'll give you this. Now you're in position. I give you a final rev. And when I drop it, you're off. We'll aim you straight for Japan. One more thing. Once we're lined up for the takeoffs, there can be no delays. If your plane stalls, if it doesn't start immediately, if you have any trouble of any kind, we won't have time to do anything about it. The Navy crew has orders to push the ship overboard and make way for the next one. Lieutenant Jurika has detailed maps and pictures of cities and specified targets. Mr. Jurika spent a great many years in Japan. I think it might be a good idea if he gave you some idea of what kind of people you're going to run up against in case you're forced down. Mr. Jurika. I was Assistant Naval Attach at our embassy in Japan, long enough to learn a few things about the Orient. Just what should we do, Mr. Jurika? How should we conduct ourselves in case we are forced down over Japan? My advice is, see that you're not forced down over Japan. The run I've got figured out for you starts here. The smokestacks are bright red brick, and you can't miss them. One of the largest smelters in Japan. Then, following the line of the bay and allowing 10 seconds between bombs you should take out this and this. Both of them are machine shops owned by brothers, I forget their names but I remember I didn't like them. Then on out here to drop your incendiary. How does this line up for you, Lawson? Well, you're going to drop them, Clever. The run seems all right for me if it's okay for you. - We can take them out. - Fine. Jones, have you got the course laid out for this run? Yes. Over here, fellows. Now you'll take off about here. You go due west to Tokyo at minimum cruising speed, flying at about 50 feet. When you hit the bay, get up to about 1,500 complete your bombing run, then down again and out to sea, - south by southeast to Yakushima. - Can we take the maps with us? All you need. Be sure there are no marks on them though, which might show the Japs where you came from in case you're captured. By the way, I'm taking off first with four incendiaries. That should light up Tokyo pretty well for you. Suppose by the time we get to China, the Japs have taken over the landing field? The Chinese will arrange a signal for you when you get to the field if the Japs have captured it. If that's the case you've got to keep right on going until you've run out of gas then bail out and destroy your planes. Yes. There's just been a change in the disposition of the barrage balloons over Tokyo. This balloon and this one were moved this morning to here and here. You know, the changes in those balloons threw me. Just think, a bunch of guys sweating all day in a sub down under Tokyo bay, guys just like us sneaking up at night to radio balloon positions. Just let me hear anybody talk about the Navy again. Boy, they're good. Plenty. They're not bad at poker either. Oh, you're not kidding. I kind of figured on getting Ellen a present in Chungking, you know, a kimono or something. But these Navy guys have cleaned me. Believe it or not, I've only got 14 bucks. Well, I got $8 or $10 I could let you have. Oh, no. No. I've been thinking, cigarettes sell for 60 cents a carton on the boat here. But in Chungking, I hear the boys will pay seven bucks. Yeah? So I figure I may load the duck with coffin nails. Hey, that's an idea. - It's a good night for subs. - Yeah. You know, it's funny. When I was a kid I used to dream about going someplace on a ship. Well, here I am. And out there is Japan. My mother had a Jap gardener once. He seemed like a nice little guy. You know, I don't hate Japs, yet. It's a funny thing. I don't like them, but I don't hate them. I guess I don't either. You get kind of mixed up. Yeah. It's hard to figure. Yet here we are. All I ever wanted to be was an aeronautical engineer. I joined the Army in '40 because I figured it was the best way to learn. I wasn't sore at anybody. But here you suddenly realize you're going to drop a ton of high explosives on one of the biggest cities in the world. You're not getting squeamish, are you? Oh, no, of course not. I don't pretend to like the idea of killing a bunch of people but it's the case of drop a bomb on them or pretty soon they'll be dropping one on Ellen. Yeah, that's right. I wonder how many of us will pull through. Oh, they figure about half. - And everybody thinks he'll be in that half. - Yeah. - When are you going to get married, Bob? - Oh, when I find somebody like Ellen. It'd be swell, you know. The four of us. You know, when this is over I'd like to get me a small ranch. Something that'd run about 40 or 50 head of cattle. A nice well and a house. It'd be wonderful for kids. I've always been kind of nuts about ranches myself. You know, in a decent year you can make real dough out of 40 head of cattle, if you've got feed. - Why don't we do something like that? - Well, I'm game if you are. - Okay, it's a deal. - Good. Of course, now if we had 80 head of cattle we'd really have ourselves a layout. - Yeah, and our own meat too. - Oh, yeah, milk, butter, eggs, the whole works. You know, a guy who's got himself a place, he doesn't have to worry about anything. - And with a little hunting near. - Oh, sure, that's easy. Gosh, I'll be glad when this war ends. In the event of an emergency there will be no assembly. No last minute instructions. We'll just take off. If you should develop motor trouble within a half hour after leaving the Hornet, fly back to the ship and land in the water. The Navy will try to fish you out. If trouble should develop after that time, you'll have to keep right on going. Because by that time the fleet will have to fire on any craft overhead. I don't want you to throw out the extra cans of gas as you use them. That would leave a perfect trail for the Japs to follow back to the Hornet. Save the cans and throw them all out at one time. Now let me repeat something I've said previously. You are to bomb the military targets assigned to you and nothing else. Of course, in an operation of this kind you cannot avoid killing civilians. Because war plants are manned by civilians. If any of you have any moral feelings about this necessary killing, if you feel that you might think of yourself afterward as a murderer, I want you to drop out. We'll find someone to take your place. And I promise you that no one will blame you for your feelings. Barring any sudden switch in plans, we'll take off tomorrow night. There's one thing more. When we meet in Chungking I'm going to throw you a party that you can tell your grandchildren about. You're a great bunch of guys. I'm proud to be associated with you. Good luck. - 12 cartons of cigarettes. - 12 cartons? Say, what gives with the Army? I've never sold so many cigarettes in my life. - We're chain smokers. - You must eat them. What kind will it be? Oh, any kind. - You just want lots of cigarettes. - You hit it right on the head. All right. That'll be $7.20. Now hear this. Our carrier task force has been sighted by enemy surface vessels. All Army pilots and crews, man your planes for immediate takeoff. There goes a Jap just three minutes after we sighted her. Yeah. That means she had two minutes to tell Tokyo what she saw. Now hear this. Get all bombs loaded on the double. - Are you all packed? - Have been for five days, sir. Good. Better watch how those guys handle the Duck. I will, sir. And don't tell anybody about that bumped turret. I won't, sir. - Hey, we're off, aren't we? - Yeah! Oh, bomb me, daddy! I think I've got everything packed. - Swell, thanks. - I'm sorry we couldn't have picked out a little better weather for you. - We'll make it. So long, Felton. - Give them a pasting they'll never forget. We will. Look, thanks for everything. You guys in the Navy, well, you're okay. Be seeing you. Now hear this. Clear the flight deck to start engines. Hey, how about my change? They're giving us fifteen extra cans instead of ten. Good. At least getting off now will put us over Tokyo in daylight. Don't forget about the barrage balloons in daylight too. Oh, next you'll be telling me it's good because you can get better pictures in the daytime. - You're not kidding about that, either. - Let's give her a final check. Hey, Bob. - What? - Are you up ahead? Fourth spot. See you in Chungking. You said it, brother. - How they doing? - Doolittle will be off any second. Then Hoover, Holstrom, Gray and Davey Jones, we're seventh. Seven's a lucky number. Ted, Ted. Hey, Ted, Ted, hey. Put these some place, will you? - What are they? - Sizzle platters. I've got the phonograph in my ship. But I haven't got room for the records. We'll meet in Chungking and cut a Chinese rug. Okay, Shorty. - Take care of these, will you, McClure? - Right. - Pilot to gunner. - Gunner to pilot. Go ahead, sir. Take a look at the turret if you get a chance. I've been working on that, sir. She's still jammed. We'll use the auxiliary power if we have to. Right, sir. We've got ourselves in a fine jam, haven't we, Lawson? Well, this is a great time to think of that. Oh, no, I mean having to take off ahead of schedule. Oh, I'm sorry, Davenport. I guess maybe I'm a little on edge. - Bomb bay clear? - Bomb bays clear. - Clear on right? - Clear on right. - Clear on left? - Clear on left. He made it. He made it. Get your flaps up. Hey! Good luck, fellows. Hand them a couple for the Navy. - We sure will, Miller. - And thanks to you. Wish I were going with you. So long. - So long. - So long. Goodbye, boys. - Four more ahead of us. - Let's start the engines. Let's go. - Clear on right? - Clear on right? Clear on right. Clear on left? Clear on left. Those Navy guys are moving up to push us over. They're not gonna toss this ship overboard. Come on, baby. Give. Give. Give. Check hydraulic pressure. - Hydraulic pressure okay. - Check brake pressure. Okay. There goes Bob. Two more ahead of us. Check fuel booster. Hey, Army. Ted! Give them for me. When we get to Chungking, we'll tell them it was a Navy show too. They'll know that when they see how broke you are. Good hunting. - Bomb bay doors closed. - Bomb bays closed. - Pilot to gunner. All set, Thatcher? - Everything okay, sir. - Wing flaps down. - Wing flaps coming down. There goes Hallmark. We're taking off, fellows. Happy landings. Phew! Yeah. Both the flaps up. We didn't even have them down. How do you like that? I wonder what else we forgot. Coffee, sandwiches, water, plenty. Pilot to gunner. Thatcher. Gunner to pilot. Go ahead, sir. - You all right, Thatcher? - Yes, sir. You'd better get started on those cans. - We've burned over 40 gallons already. - Yes, sir. Well, we're on our way. If anybody's carrying a rabbit's foot, hang on to it tight. What's our position, McClure? I figure about an hour and 58 minutes from the coast. Get that, Thatcher? We can expect their fighters any time now. - Keep your eyes open. - Watching, sir. There's nothing in sight. Could we try out this turret again? Okay. Relay switch on. It works all right, sir, but that emergency power's not going to hold out long if we run into trouble. Turning it off now. - How far are we behind our first gang? - About an hour. Then we really can get set for trouble. Yeah, but nothing like what the guys behind us are going to run into. I'd feel a lot better on a night job. Did you hear that left engine miss? No, singing like a lark. I must be hearing things. Navigator to pilot. Pilot to Navigator. Go ahead. We ought to hit the Japanese coast any minute. Look. - See that flag? - Yeah. - Saving bombs today. - They're waving at us. Those guys must be nuts. Japanese coast straight ahead. Fujiyama. We'll be catching buckshot any second now. Zeros. - Pilot to... - I saw them, sir. - Shall I turn the power on for the turret? - No, wait a minute. I don't know what happened to them, sir. I guess they didn't see us. There she is fellows. Take a good gander. When we get back home, the folks will want to know what Tokyo used to look like. That must be Davey Jones giving them the works. Pilot to bombardier, bomb bay doors open. - There we are, the big red smokestack. - Pilot to bombardier, - approaching smelter. - I'm on it. They've got our altitude. One away. Two away. Three away. Four away. - Six fighters just above and to the right. - Have you got them, Thatcher? Ready for them, sir. Why don't they dive? They're going away. We're not going to wait for them to come back. We're getting out of here. Well, I guess maybe we're in that lucky half. Not yet. Not till we get to China. Wow. What a headache. - Were you scared? - I'm still scared. - McClure, on our course? - On our course. A hundred and sixty gallons. I hope it's enough to get us to Changchow. Yeah, and I hope the Japs don't get there first. What's the dope, McClure? About 200 miles to Changchow. - And we ought to hit the coast any minute. - We'll never find it in the dark. Pilot to crew. We're going up and flying on instruments. When the gas is gone we'll bail out. We'll buzz it. Maybe we can land. Keep a lookout for rocks or logs. All set for landing. McClure, get our guns out. Take off chutes and be sure your life jackets are on. Carry your guns. Wheels down. Flaps down. Air speed 135. I lost my ship. I lost my ship. - You hurt bad? - I don't... I don't know. I can't move my arms. Your leg, it's all busted up, sir. Get Davenport. Ted, Ted, look at me. That baby and I... We won't ever need anything but you. We mustn't either of us be scared about it, Ted, because the baby, the baby's why I know you're coming back to us. Lawson! Shall I shoot them, Lieutenant? No, hold it. - But they may be Japs, sir. - Don't shoot, Thatcher. Hey! Hey! He says he's Chinese. What's that word for American? That leg's got to be sewn up, sir. It's split wide open. Me, Charlie. Americans. - We're Americans. - American. Americans. We need a doctor, and some help to get to Changchow. Chiang Kai-shek. - We're his friends. In Chungking. - Chungking! - Yes. - That's right. We go Chungking. Chungking many, many days. Many. Doctor. Doctor. Charlie, go, go doctor. Charlie, bring doctor here. Charlie, bring doctor or we die. Doctor, one li. One li, that's a Chinese mile. One li. Go. Bring doctor. Doctor, Japanese man. Japanese doctor. Maybe Japanese man, Japanese soldier, come here. Japanese man no come at night. Boat, you go boat. Let's go. Hey, cut that out. I think he wants to trade bullets with you, Thatcher. Friend. Charlie, friend. Charlie, go. Charlie, friend. Sure, Charlie, friend. Goodbye, Charlie. The Japs must be all around us. - I wonder where the rest of the gang is? - Scattered all over the China coast, if they're alive. I think I'm going to pass out. - I, Ted, take you, Ellen. - To be my lawfully wedded wife. To be my lawfully wedded wife. - To have and to cherish. - To have and to cherish. Until death us do part. Until death us do part. Until death us do part. Until death us do part. Don't let them cut my leg off. Please, don't let them cut my leg off. - Don't let them cut my leg off. - Lawson, stop it. Lawson. - Don't. - Lawson. - What's the matter? - You were yelling. Thank you. My name is Foo Ling. Everything we have is yours. We know what you have done and we honor you for it. Our navigator has both his shoulders broken. Is there anybody who can set them for him? No one. But we hope that help will soon arrive for you. Thanks. How are they? We have washed them. They are bandaged. But we have no medicines. Not even aspirin. What's that? - This is Dr. Chung. - How do you do? We've come a long way and we're going home now and we've been hunting a doctor everywhere. I understand. Have you got anything that'll knock them out, Doctor? They're in awful pain. We hope to have some medical supplies by the time we reach my father's hospital. Hospital? Where's that? In Lin Hai. About 60 li from here. - I have come to take you there. - It's a funny thing, Doctor. There were a lot of planes and we had to take off early. - You see how it was. - Of course. They aren't in any shape to make much of a trip, Doctor. We'll have to move them at once. The Japanese captured one of your crews yesterday, not very far from here. So many planes, and we don't know what happened to the others. All up and down the Chinese Coast. My countrymen are seeking your countrymen. We'll bring them through. I have some money. I want to give it to you. Please, Lieutenant, you have given us enough already. - What? - The bombs you dropped on Japan. Please, now try to rest. The Japanese, they are in the village we just left. - Chan. - Mr. Parker. - Mrs. Parker. - Doctor Chan. - How are they? - They are very, very sick. - I'll need your help. - How close are the Japanese? They took Ching Ming three hours after our departure. One of the American crews has already fallen into their hands. Hadn't they better be taken straight through to Hop Sai? They couldn't stand the trip. This is my father, Dr. Chung. - The others, please, help them. - Please, don't worry, Lieutenant. We'll take care of everybody. You won't have to take it off, will you, Doc? We hope not. One cannot tell. You've had a long journey. Now you must rest. All we had at our Mission was a little antiseptic fluid and some bandages. But we've sent out runners for supplies. Is there any way I could get a message out? I'd like my mother to know that I'm okay. The whole region's swarming with Japanese. Well, do you think they've heard back in the States what happened to us? We've been listening in on short wave. They know all about the raid, but apparently they're keeping the details secret until the rest of your men have been saved. Have they found any of the others? We have word that one crew will be coming through here pretty soon now. I understand there's a doctor among them. Oh, that must be Lieutenant Smith's crew. Excuse me. Lieutenant Smith's crew has been rescued, sir. Smith's? They found Lieutenant Smith and Doc White and they're coming here. Don Smith's crew. The Doc was flying with Don Smith. They'll be here any minute now. It's funny, isn't it? I mean the way Clever's head just keeps rocking back and forth, back and forth. Somebody ought to help Clever. I think the Chinese are a swell bunch of people but I can't say I go for their music. Shorty Manch would go all to pieces if he heard a little of this. Yeah. How's Lawson? Well, his leg looks pretty bad, sir. Dr. Chung thinks gangrene has set in. Looks like a Jap Zero. You guys ought to go on and leave me. They think I'm passed out half the time and I hear what they say. The Japs are coming closer all the time. Why don't you guys go? We're not sticking around here because of you, Lawson. - None of us here are able to travel yet. - I was just thinking. I guess Ellen and I aren't going to ski anymore. That's too bad. I was going to teach her some fancy stuff. Now don't start talking like that. You're going to pull through all right. What do you think a girl would do? I mean, say Ellen and I like to ski. Be kind of funny if they cut my leg off, wouldn't it? Why don't you try to go to sleep? Yeah, it'd be kind of funny, all right. You marry a guy, he's got two arms and two legs. Then he comes back and he hasn't any. - I am Dr. Chung. - Where are the boys? How are you, Pop? Did you have a good trip? - Here they are. - Hi, fellas. - How are you? - How you doing? - Hello, Sarge. - It's good to see you. - Holy Joe, what happened to you guys? - Nothing serious. The Duck forgot to duck. Yeah, McClure's been trying to do his own flying ever since. This really looks like something left over from a massacre. Well, you guys don't look so good yourselves. You don't smell so good either. Well, there's nothing wrong with us that a good bath won't fix. - I wish we could say the same for you. - How's the grub around here? I think I'd like a good thick steak, French fried onions and a baked potato with plenty of butter and about three bottles of beer... You'll take bean sprouts and like them. - Say, where's Lawson and Davenport? - They're upstairs. - Lawson's in pretty bad shape. - You better go up and see him. He needs you bad, Doc. Well, it's certainly good to see you fellows again. Hey, Pop, how's the chop suey around here? He doesn't speak English. I'm sorry, Pop. Yeah, and when Shorty jumped, he had two. 45s, a. 44 rifle, a. 22 automatic, that Luger of his, a hunting knife, a Bowie knife - and an ax. - What a guy. He stuffed his shirt full of chocolate bars but he forgot to button his collar. So when he pulled the rip cord, he just naturally molted candy all over North China. - What happened to his photograph? - It went down with the ship. Next morning Manch scared the Chinese right out of their wits. They didn't know anything human grew that tall. What about Bob Gray? He's okay. I think they moved on to Chungking. Oh, yeah, and that guy "Me, Charlie" said to tell you hello. If it hadn't been for Charlie, the Japs would have had us that first day. Yeah, us too. I'd like to come back some day and fight alongside that guy. Me, too. Well, it's all over. Let's save some of this talk for tomorrow. A pint and a half, that's not bad. You'd better get to bed now. You're an old grandma, Doc. But I'll take it slow, just as a favor to you. Be seeing you, Lawson. Thanks, Doc. How's the leg, Doc? It's not good, Lawson. The next forty-eight hours will tell the story. Well, thank you. - Hey, Don. - Yeah? Tell Doolittle to hold off that party till we get there. Okay, Davenport. We'll wait for you. - Where's Thatcher? - He's in with Lawson. He'll be right out. Okay. I wish you would let me stay here until you're ready to go, sir. These people will take care of us. There's no reason for you fellows to hang around and maybe get caught. Yeah, I know, but I might come in handy if the Japs show up, sir. Thatcher, when you get back to the States, if you should run into my wife, just tell her I'm okay. Don't let her know about anything being wrong. I understand, sir. And say hello for me to that girl in Billings. That I will, sir. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Thatcher. Good morning. - Good morning, Lawson. - Hi, Doc. I'll try not to hurt you, Lawson. I'll have a look at this. Thanks. You going to take the leg, Doc? Yeah, I think so. We talked it over and there's nothing else to do. It's pretty rough to have to cut a man's leg off. I guess it'll be all right. After all, a wooden leg is just kind of like wearing a shoe with a high instep. When are you gonna do it? I might as well give you a shot right now. You mean we have something to knock me out? Our runners arrived with anesthetic this morning. It'll only be a spinal, Lawson. You won't feel anything from the waist down, but you'll be conscious. That's the best we can do. Oh, swell. I can watch you and make sure you don't take off too much. All right, Lawson. We'll have to roll you over. It'll take a little time to work. We'll get you over to the operating room. - Doc? - Yes? - How high are you going to cut? - Oh, not too high. - Will I have a knee, Doc? - I'm afraid not, Lawson. - Any feeling there? - No. Look, Doc. We can't waste any time, Lawson. When that anesthetic wears off, - we haven't got any more. - Okay, but just one thing more. Yes. If anything happens, don't let Ellen know anything about the operation. She might just as well think I died while all in one piece. All right, Lawson. Now, you're not going to feel this. But you might get nervous and jump or something, so the nurses are going to hold you. Okay, Doc. Fire away. Oh, when you said "no knee," you weren't kidding. If I cut any lower we might have to do it again and your system couldn't take it. What're you stalling for, Doc? We're doing the best we can, Lawson. Take it easy. Okay. Only hurry. It seems like I'm beginning to feel my other leg. It seems like I can move my toes, Doc. I think I can move my ankle. Hurry, Doc, I'm sure I can. Hurry, Doc, hurry. - Hello. - Hello. Hello, Ellen? - Ted, where are you? - I'm in a lumber camp. I had to make a forced landing in a mud puddle. - You aren't hurt, are you? - No, not a scratch. - Have you got the tree all fixed? - Oh, yes, Ted. You should just see it. - It's so beautiful. - Anything under it? - Oh, yes. - Well, let's open them up. - Oh, we can't do that. - Sure we can. Go ahead. Well, if you say so. I'm not going to be cheated out of my Christmas by a cracked up airplane. Oh, Ted, it's the most beautiful box of candy I've ever seen in my whole life. Good. Isn't there maybe something else lying around? - Let me see. Yes, there is. - Well, open it. It's a silk scarf. And it looks like it's handmade, too. - I'll bet it's got my initials on it. - That's not fair. You peeked while I was making it. I just know my wife. - Oh, Ted, I wish you were here. - So do I, honey. I'll be thinking of you tonight. I'll sit in front of the tree and turn the radio on to Christmas carols and just think of you. Thank you. And thank you, scouts. I mean, all the fellows would like to thank you very much, for everything. Lieutenant, my father has asked me to present this to you. It has been in our family since the fifteenth century. Father begs me to tell you that beauty belongs to beauty, and asks that you honor him by presenting it to your wife. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I didn't know that you knew about Ellen, my wife. You spoke of her a number of times. It says, "This is an American hero who has bombed Japan. "Whenever he goes among the people of China, "let him be accorded respect and honor. " He has just come from Kow Chai. Another one of your crews has been captured and the Japanese are moving in this direction. I think Lawson will be able to travel in a couple of days. There's nothing wrong with me, Doc. I can travel right now. I'm afraid a couple of days will be too long. This is Wang Tsung. He has walked all the way from his native village of Kow Chai. And he begs the honor of presenting gifts to his American Allies. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. He felt a lot worse than I did. There, I can get along pretty well already. I should say very well for your first day out of bed. I guess, I'll have to be a little more careful. I don't ever want anybody to see me do that. I don't want anybody to see me till I get a new leg. Lieutenant White, word just came. The American plane will pick you up in Changchow tomorrow afternoon at 5:00. Wonderful. He says if we don't hurry, the Japanese may get there first. - When are you leaving? - We're going to stay here. We're quite used to it, you know. - Here. This may come in handy. - Thank you. You and Mr. Parker have done so much for us, and we'll never forget it. - Goodbye, Lawson. - Goodbye. - Good luck. - Thank you, sir. - Goodbye. God bless you. - Goodbye. Thank you. My father wishes me to tell you that you have honored us with your visit and that he will offer prayers for your safe return to America. Isn't he coming along with us? Father feels that he must stay with his people. They will need him here. Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye, Doctor. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye, Doc, and thanks for everything. - I hope, sir, that we may meet again. That goes double, Doc. Goodbye, Doctor, and thank you. Thank you. If you ever come to the States, Doctor, look me up, will you? I'll be in the Portland telephone directory. - With pleasure. - Goodbye, Doctor. I have one sorrow, Lieutenant, that we did not have the medicine to ease your pain. - You saved my life, Doc. - I hope someday you will come back to us. We'll be back, maybe not us ourselves but a lot of guys like us. And I'd like to be with them. - Because you're our kind of people. - Thank you, sir, and goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. - Go ahead, sit down. - Thank you. I know how you feel. Take it for a while. Thanks. Smell that? That's America. That's the USA. Every time I make a trip back, she smells better and better. Yeah. - I think I know what you mean. - I'm from Pittsburgh. I know it may seem screwy to you, but it seems to me as if I can smell some of that coal smoke right off the old Monongahela River. That sound crazy? No. I'm from California and I can smell orange blossoms. Oh, it couldn't be, that's too far. It must come from Florida. Oh, if you want flavor, you've got to have a California orange, but for smelling, Florida's just as good. Hello. Yes. What's that? - Just a minute. Ellen. - Yes? Ellen, Washington on the phone. Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Lawson. Hello, Colonel. I mean General Doolittle. Oh, yes, I'm fine, thank you. No, not a bit excited, General. Oh, he's back, Mother. Ted's back. He's back. Oh yes, General, how is he? Oh, yes. I understand. Of course, I do. Yes, I'll be ready. I know, I know. Oh, that's so nice of you, General. Yes, thank you. Oh, yes, thank you, General. Thank you. Just cry, darling. Cry it out. He got in this morning, Mother. General Doolittle just saw him, so it's true. General Doolittle's sending a plane ticket for me. Ted doesn't want to see me. He doesn't want to see me because he's lost his leg and he doesn't even want me to know it's happened till he gets a new leg and learns how to use it. As if it would make any difference. As if anything would make any difference to me as long as he's alive. Oh, I'm going to see him, I'm going to see him. Well, that means we have to get your clothes ready in a hurry. Have my things come back from the cleaners yet? Let's see, I'll take this suit. And my blue coat. He always liked it best. I can't take any of these things. I can't take any of my pretty clothes. They don't fit me anymore. Do you think Ted's going to pay any attention to what kind of clothes you wear or how you look? He always did. Oh, Mother, I'm scared. There's nothing to be frightened about. Lots of people lose a leg or arm - and continue living perfectly normal lives. - I'm not scared about Ted. - I'm scared about me. - About you? Well, you see, most husbands and wives are together while things are changing. Husbands get used to things like that because, well, they're around. Ted's been gone all this time and when he went away, I was so slim. All the time he's been gone, he's been thinking of me like that. Ted loves you Ellen, and you love him. That's why neither of you is going to notice any change when you meet. - Do you think so, Mother? - I know so. All the same, if I held my coat like this when I walk into the room, don't you think it would hide me, just a little? Hello, Lawson. How're you feeling? - Pretty good, sir. - You look fine. Thank you, sir. - Won't you sit down, sir? - Yeah, thanks. - Well, got any plans? - About what, sir? Well, about the future. Have you decided what you're going to do? Not particularly, sir. I always wanted to be an aeronautical engineer. I suppose I'll start studying again after they muster me out. Who said they'd muster you out? Well, I won't be much use to anybody with a... What are you talking about? Do you think we'd let a man of your experience get away from us? - Well, that's fine, sir. Thank you. - Don't thank me. I just happened to think of something, Lawson. Yes, sir? What about your wife? Does she knew you're back? - No, sir. - Why not? Well, I thought I'd wait till I get my new leg and my scars fixed up. It won't be so much of a shock to her that way. Shock? What kind of a girl did you marry, anyway? She's okay, sir. She's a fine girl. Well then, she deserves to know. She deserves to see you too. No, no, sir. If you don't mind, I'd rather wait. When I see Ellen again, I'm going to be all dressed up and have a new leg. And I'm going to take her out to the best place in town and I'm going to dance with her. - That may be quite a while, Lawson. - No, sir. You see, I'm getting along fine. And in a month or two... In a month or two you'll be back at work, hard work. Well, I'll try to drop in on you again, Lawson. - I hope you can, sir. - Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. Your wife's going to have a baby, isn't she? Yes, sir. I've got a couple of kids myself, both in the service. You know, Lawson, if my kids and all the other kids who are in this thing could fix it so this would really be the last one, your kid would get quite a break, wouldn't he? He sure would, sir. I just had to come. Ted, Ted, Ted. Let me help you. Don't, Ellen. You'll hurt the baby. When things were worst, when there didn't seem to be any chance at all, I could see your face, your beautiful face. I knew you were coming home, Ted. Tell me, honey. How come you're so cute? I had to be if I was going to get such a good looking fellow. English
