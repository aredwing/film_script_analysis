This is the biggest invention of this century: The gramophone It can contain your most beautiful voice Amazing! Even voices can be captured now This is an English folk song. The story is that King Henry Vlll wrote it for a girl who rejected his love. Really? That's amazing! The girl had character Oh my God! You scratched my record. How am I going to sell it? I didn't mean it... Well... I'll pay you for it This is very expensive. Do you have the money?

I'll pay you back Don't worry about it Thank you Sister! We don't have a gramophone at home. What did you buy the record for? I wasn't buying a record, I was buying a feeling You hit my head with that thing. Pay! Sorry, Sir! I don't have the money I don't care. You've got to pay me Where will I find No money, eh? Sister!

Don't worry! Good morning Good morning Good Morning, Reverend Good morning Good morning Good Morning, Reverend Good morning, class Practice more at home, understand? Is Ip Man at home, please? He's gone to Hong Kong. May I know who's asking for him, please? It's nothing important. Thank you. Good morning, Brother Chung So Let's eat fried sticks These fried sticks look very interesting You are all big eaters, double sticks aren't enough to feed you. So I made them triple Let's eat! Why are you people so unhygienic? You want to know why? Come on! Do you know now? Let me help you Don't bother! There you are! How nice! Chairman Lee Godfather Thanks for looking after me, Mei Wai. Here's a present for you. How beautiful! Thank you Tin Chi, you have given tremendous help ever since you joined the Jing Wu Athletic Association Don't mention it Anyway, I have a present for you, too Thank you, Chairman Lee These were selected from my jade collection They seem like a pair Definitely, a pair, like you two I've never seen Chinese pigs playing hockey before. It's so funny! Hey, you! Mind your language. My language? It's none of your business I heard you say Chinese pigs Oh, no, no! I'm sorry, I didn't mean Chinese pigs I meant... Sick Man of East Asia! Come on, then! I'll give you three minutes No, two minutes No, one minute Good! Just 45 seconds! Take a seat Relax It's OK Your Kung Fu is formidable We call it Wing Chun What's your friend's name? He's wonderful His name is... Good morning, Ip Man! Morning Master Ip, morning Say "Good morning" to him! Morning! Have I met them before? Good morning, Ip Man Not this one, I'm sure Boss! I'm not the boss here, I'm the manager How can I help? I need some medicine for a friend What else would you buy in a drug store, kid Which is better to treat bruises, powder or ointment? What? He's injured? What happened? A fight? What else? Who beat him? I did I thought he was your friend That's how we became friends Why did you beat him? Boss, why don't you... Why don't you bring him here? Here to receive treatment? Treatment? Bring him here so I can beat him, too. Make sure he won't call us 'Chinese pigs' again Where did you learn about that? From your friends. You and your name are known to everybody on this street now, Ip Man You're popular kid. So, you're studying Wing Chun? Authentic Wing Chun. The name was inherited from the school taught by Master Leung Jan from Foshan So you must be one of Chin's (Nickname of Chan Wah Shun) Disciples Correct! Authentic my foot. So much so that you made me believe you learned directly from Master Ng Mui How long have you studied it? Finished the lower body strength training yet? What about 'targeted finger'? You're in Wing Chun, too, boss? First, I told you I'm not the boss; I'm the manager here Second, I am practicing Wing Chun, but don't know if it's considered authentic Do you want to try it out? Next time I might be too busy next time. If you want to try me, try me now Better not, if there is any injury... Are you looking down on old folks like me? Come on! Mr Manager! Hasn' t your master taught you that when practicing with the others, you reserve only the strength applied, not the skill? What, despise me? I mean business then Are you alright, kid? I'm fine Well, again! Watch my medicine! Be careful with the Three-Prick Wine Wait! You call this Wing Chun? Whatever comes from my fist is Wing Chun They are not Wing Chun My Master said Wing Chun strategic movements are 70% from the hands, attacking an opponent's lower body Your master wasn't wrong. The traditional focus is on the use of the hands But that doesn't mean it forbids changes. Changes allow more flexibility Movements can be adapted in multiple ways, such as leg movements in a form of wrestling, and they all work May I know your name, please? I'm Leung Bik from Foshan. People call me Sir Bik Master Leung Jan was my father You're my senior! So is my Wing Chun authentic? You're funny Come back the day after tomorrow, kid Come here the day after tomorrow? Don't you want lessons? Of course I do. But I can't afford to pay you Did I ask you to pay? Customs inspection. Open the crates, officers! Hold it! Inspection is not authorized. The medicine was purchased from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce by the British Embassy Mr. Kitano said you can't open this as it was purchased from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce by the British Embassy I don't understand English How dare a low-ranking customs officer display public contempt for the Japanese business bureau Should any damage be incurred, who will be held responsible? How dare a low-ranking customs officer like you display public contempt for the Japanese business bureau Should any damage be incurred, who will be held responsible? If smuggling is going on, who will be held responsible, then? Officers, open the crates! Mr. Kitano said you can't open this Stop! What do you think you're doing? Do you know who this gentleman is? Do you know how much Mr. Kitano donates to Foshan every year? My apologies! Mr. Kitano. You may take the goods What're you standing here for? Clear the way! Of course I welcome donations. But if they are from the Japanese, I will definitely decline Why did you make such a comment, Chairman? Japan's evil intentions became apparent after the Russo-Japanese War, they annexed our territory... and built the Manchurian Railway, aiming at economic invasion Look at what they did in the North-East, their ambitions are obvious I think I understand how the Chairman feels But the thing is, the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Foshan did not participate in the North-Eastern affair Mr. Kitano came here only to do business, not much different from other foreign investors So I think we should treat his donation the same way as others I don't believe the Japanese would make a donation without a personal agenda Well... after he's done business for so long in Foshan, this could probably be his gesture of retuning a favor Don't be suspicious You're in business, too, Tin Chi. Why don't you tell us what you think, as a newcomer? I tend to agree with what Chairman Lee suggested After all, ourAssociation is on very sound financial ground, and is not urgently in need of donations Tin Chi, I'm going back to the school See you later Try to talk Chairman Lee out of being so stubborn, Tin Chi Mr. Mayor, we are all educated people Why should we allow the uneducated to upset us? You are right Goodbye Take care Bye The improved version of Wing Chun is the good use of'distant fist, near elbow, close wrestling, incorporating long and short distance movements' Wing Chun wrestling uses the reverse joint principle; no need to hold on to your opponent Your Master concentrated on the long stretch and low kick My improved version of Wing Chun incorporates the short stretch and high kick Wing Chun should not be described as 'authentic' or 'non-authentic' anymore To me, Wing Chun is one big family, there is no distinction between you, me, and him Goodbye, Man Ip Our surname goes first, Reverend Ip Man, all the best Same to you, goodbye Goodbye Let's go Bye! Bye! Goodbye! Bye! Thank you Thank you You should have told me you were coming back, Ip Man Mei Wai Ip Man's back, everybody! You brought back so many things Only this one is mine, the rest are presents for you all We know Ip Man is good to us! OK This is for you For me? How am I supposed to finish all these toffees Don't eat them all, some are for my brother to sell Man! Tin Chi's back! Brother! There you are! Yes! Long time no see. You're still stout. Keeping up with martial arts practice? Do you want to try me? Sure! Give it to me One point for Man Great! Another point for you, Man! What style is this? Wing Chun! The high kick doesn't exist in Wing Chun, where did you pick that up? Try me more first OK Good! One point for Tin Chi Excellent! Good! Don't tell me this is Wing Chun, Man? This is fantastic. Show me, Ip Man It's wonderful! Teach me, too Me, too Me first! One at a time Mei Wai, watch out! Is this necessary, Man? I'm all right. Take it easy next time Take a rest, Mei Wai Let's learn it together To reward your enthusiasm. Come on! Alright? Amazing! This focuses on the reverse joint principle It's a different approach like Japanese Judo, there's no need to hold on to your opponent It's amazing! I want to learn, too Me, too Count me in Brother Chung So Brother Chung So Let me help you Such a fat chicken, let me take care of it Remember what Master Chan said to you, Man? Time to go home Let's go! I ask you Whose style is authentic, our Master Chan's or Leung Bik's? Leung Bik? Brother Chung So, Mr Leung and our Master are from the same school; his style shouldn't be considered deviant from authenticity Also, Leung Bik is Grand Master Leung Jan's son; he practiced with him since he was a child But he never got along with the Grand Master, nor with his brothers. Leung Bik is conceited Perhaps... he held different views Despite a difference in views, he shouldn't have created tension in the family I remember after the Grand Master passed away, Bik's brother immendiately put up a wall... to partition the two families; you can see how badly he was received by the others He's a bit strange, but we can't assume that his art is not competent People often thought that Wing Chun seldom uses wrestling moves But he believes that by applying the targeted finger style or darting hand movements, opponents can be overpowered I've tried it and it's very effective. Comparing Bik's with the tradional moves, his allow more flexibility Let me tell you, the Wing Chun Leung Bik has learned... only accounts for a fraction of his father's. Most of his movements are made up How can one improve without deconstructing the old? You are greedy to aspire for more before you can manage the basic Wing Chun principles You'll end up gaining nothing. I'm fed up. Enjoy your meal Don't get upset, Brother Chung So Man just got back, give him a chance! Fine! He has his chance now Show me the sort of deviance you've picked up. Get up, up! Brother Chung So! Brother Chung So! Ip Man Brother Chung So! Stay away! What happened to the things Leung Bik taught you? Brother Chung So! Man! Ip man should be feeling sorry by now Brother Chung So, that's enough! Was it Wing Chun that he just demonstrated? Does our school have high kick like that? Or elbow as low as his? Now, I demand you all go on your knees in front of our master and vow that... you will never again learn anything that deviates from our school tradition They have nothing to do with this, Brother Chung So It was me who wanted to try things out. They never said they wanted to learn it from me. I'm the only one who deserves punishment for this I have taught you all I know, Man Thank you, Master! Stop calling me master Why? Your master is Chan Wah Shun; you have to show due respect When I was young, I was too emotional to try to think from another's perspective And my family was too conservative to accept my innovative ideas, thus causing a lot of misunderstanding and friction In order to aviod conflict, I decided to leave Foshan Ip Man is gifted, but he's such an ungrateful brat Do you think I should expel him? Please give me instruction, Master If you think I should, please show 'the head' when I toss the coin Master, Ip Man is young and restless; he's doomed to make some mistakes And... perhaps it's not entirely his fault. I might not be competent enough as an instructor Why don't we do it three times to decide on the result? Thanks, Master Thanks, Master, thanks a great deal You are... We heard that your Association has a reputation for the vision of promoting martial arts on the grounds of abolishing segregation of schools So we're here to join the Association I'm glad that you share the same vision. How may I address you? Before we enroll, I'd like to see whether the Association is qualified to teach us I don't quite understand what you mean You need to show a sample when you sell goods. So we'd like to check out how competent the masters are first This is not how our Association operates. Don't make things difficult All right, then. If you don't want to demonstate, we'll be happy to take over You just came to create trouble Hold it! Wait a minute! Father Chairman Kitano, what do you want from us? Not much, I only want to say hello I don't think so, it's more like picking a fight This is a place to learn martial arts; I don't see why not! Chairman Lee, allow me Good! Good fight! Stop! What are you doing? Good! Good show! Sorry that my daughter isn't as capable Valour is better demonstrated by the young! Come and have a snack, Ip Man Yours Triple fried sticks Yes! My creation Three-sided. How can one person finish it? It's for all three of us. We each have one You two have the crispy sides, the middle part is not as crunchy The triple stick is what you wanted when you were a kid I didn't say that You really don't remember, eh? It seemed that I had a sense of humour when I was a kid Too bad you have none left. I won't eat any more Mei Wai... What have I said wrong? No! Let's eat Oh yes! I forgot to congratulate you On what? On your successful career in business, young and hopeful What's more, Chairman Lee will recommend you for Vice Chairman, a bright future lies ahead of you Stop teasing me. I owe this to Brother Chung So's leadership What's your plan after graduation? I won't keep it from you, but don't laugh at me, alright? I'd like to start a martial arts school to promote Wing Chun What a wonderful idea! If you start in Foshan, I'll come up with the capital for you Not just in Foshan, I want it all over the world I want to show the world how wonderful Wing Chun is The world? Great! Congratulations to you, Guru of Wing Chun, who will breed numerous splendid students Thank you! Also, when you become popular, let's make a film to promote Wing Chun to the whole world You'll contribute the capital, and me, the hard work Good! What about profit? Let's say thirty seventy Fifty fifty! You forty me sixty. Definite! The congee is getting cold. Eat! Done deal! Let's eat first! Sis! What? The mayor's son is here. He wants to ask you out to a film And Dad has agreed on your behalf Is that right? Yes! Did he say what film? Do you really want to go? What about Ip Man? What about your freedom of romanatic love? Freedom of romantic love? I've waited so long, but have yet to find my love Perhaps Ip Man and I are not connected Do you really think so? Or else how could I have done so much but to no avail. What else can I do about it? Look! A new film is on I don't think you're a fan of horrors. Let's go have a drink No! I want to see the film I'll go get the ticket, then This way please! Here's your ticket, have a seat. Ip Man? Miss Justice? Aren't you the daughter of the Deputy Major? How are you? Hello! Watching this film, too? Yes, what a small world! Miss Cheung was looking for you, Man Really? Anything important? Let's wait until the end of the film You're not even afraid of thugs. I thought you're the fearless kind Of course I'm fearless Don't touch me! What's happening now? Now Dracula is moving towards the female lead and about to bite her Is the biting over? He's still biting, still biting Alright, you may open your eyes now Are you sure? Yes! I'm Dracula So am I Scared the wits out of me. Excuse me Please allow me to take you home, Miss Cheung Don't worry about it, Mr. Cho, bye! Come on... Miss Cheung, when will we... Three yams, please! Thanks for taking me to the film, thank you very much. See you Bye! Buying yams? Where did you pick up your Englsih, Miss Cheung? I learned it myself My brother took English lessons in Hong Kong, too Perhaps you two can get together and practise speaking it Where are we heading now? Tomorrow will be our Master's birthday, we'll go buy a chicken OK Let's leave, Mei Wai. We don't speak English, neither do you! Let's go Didn't you say you had something to ask me? No need now You're amusing, yet I have a question to ask you Please do I've not got your name Didn't you address me as Miss Justice? I like it You're not going to tell me My name is Cheung Wing Shing The feeling of thinking of a person, whose name is not known, is like listening to a song without knowing the title Or you know the person's name, but not what he's thinking about The feeling is like listening to a song, when the title is familiar but not the tune One, two, three, four Is it hurting you? It's not nice to me. Beat it up Watch me! Like this, one, two So slow, speed it up, come on, come on Don't laugh, laughing drains energy Look at you, being around this log all day long You've grown to be loglike, hopelessly inarticulate How can I be more expressive, then? You can exercise your thoughts, for instance... Think of something you like or somebody you want to be with Well, I'll stick your name here, then, Cheung... Wing... Shing So you want to beat me up every day? No, no, no! I just want to be with you Ip man! Go and help prepare dinner I'm taking Wing Shing out for dinner Come over here, Wing Shing, I have something to tell you Go clean the study Yes, Sir! What do you want to tell me, Dad? You've made a major mistake, Wing Shing What major mistake? The worst I could think of was giving the Mayor's son the cold shoulder You shouldn't have gone out with that martial arts guy, Ip Man If you loathe martial arts guys so much, why do you support the Jing Wu Athletic Association, then? I support them because my job requires it Our freidnship is not based on a job. I'm not a hypocrite like you Me a hypocrite? I'm your dad, why won't you listen to me? I'm just worried that you make friends who are a bad influence and bring disgrace on the family Unless you don't care much about our family, go back to your room and reflect For you Thank you. I'm sure it'll bring a lot of sweet dreams I'm afraid that we might have to stop seeing each other What happened? I'm here to see Deputy Mayor Cheung Please come in! Please take a seat OK, it's done I hope to see you soon, Mr. Cheung The pleasure was all mine See you soon By the way, where can I purchase "bone china"? He wants to find out where he can purchase some Chinese bones Chinese bones? The British simply adore bone china The British have developed a taste for Chinese bones I think he can get a better price from the slaughter house Go to the "Killing Animal House" to buy some Killing Animal? Yeah, yeah, yeah! Kill, kill, kill In that place they kill chickens, kill cows, kill pigs, kill ducks, kill geese... Thank you OK! Sir! The British would like to buy bone China He wants bone china!

He was very happy and is a bit tipsy Stay here tonight, Ip Man. Go to sleep, go! Yes, Sir! Watch your step Ip Man Let's fill our glasses again, Man It's getting late, President Lee What do you mean by late? The night is still young. Tin Chi said your martial arts skill is superb Come on! Show me your skills Next time! Why next time? Let's do it tonight President Lee, seriously, it's getting late! Let's not start late, then President Lee! Sir! We don't need you here. Retire to your room. Let's try again President Lee! Let's go! Sit tight, off we go! Master Ng, Master Ip, where's Tin Chi? Isn't he coming? It was his wedding night last night. I'll tell him later Let's go in first Master This way I can't imagine the honorable and respected President ended up with such a tragic death We must locate the murderer, the President cannot die in vain Show me in. Have you reported to the police? Not yet We'd better report it first Right away Got it! Where's my brother? In his room Ip Tin Chi! Ip Tin Chi! Ip Tin Chi, come with me What's wrong? You stay here. You come with me right now; I have to talk to you What's the matter? People should have qualms of conscience What're you getting at? Didn't Lee Man Ho treat you like his son? Why did you do that? What've I done? Are you out of your mind? Stop acting innocent! Strangle me if you have the balls I have no clue what you're talking about You strangled President Lee, only you used left hand Lee is dead? I won't let him die in vain! Let go of him, Man! What are you two doing? Why start a fight? Your Godfather was killed. Look this man in the eyes. He is the killer All because he was strangled with the left hand, you're accusing me of murder I'm not the only one in Foshan who's learned the strangling move You taught me this move. You know how to strangle with your left hand, too. The Japanese want to get rid of their opponents. You must be the one who helped them Tell me, why did the Japanese send gifts to your wedding? I do business with many foreigners. It's no surprise that the Japanese would send me presents Swear that you have nothing to do with President Lee's murder All right! I, Ip Tin Chi swear... Tin Chi, the police are here Ip Man, have you reported to the police? Mr. Ip Tin Chi, we are here to take Mr. Ip Man to the police station Why are you taking my brother away? He's suspected of President Lee's murder Lee's servant witnessed a fight and heated argument between Ip Man and Lee last night The President was quite drunk and my brother just escorted him home No need to start a fight with President Lee after taking him home, right? Arrest him You're not taking Ip Man away There must be some understanding here. My brother doesn't kill Mr. Ip, please stop your wife from obstructing our course of action I'll go with them. I fear not as I'm innocent Go! Ip Tin Chi, remember you swore an oath Inspector, if you don't have enough evidence to press charges, you have to release him Deputy Mayor, Ip Man has been charged with felony. We need more time to investigate Ip Man is innocent, you can't lock him up. Miss Cheung, we go by evidence; we don't bring charges against innocent citizens There are witnesses in this case. If he's innocent, why won't he try to defend himself? You keep saying Ip Man is innocent; do you have evidence, Miss Cheung? Unless you can prove his innocence, stop making these empty claims Ip Tin Chi has been elected President of the Jing Wu Athletic Association Good! Congratulations! Thank you! Congratulations! Thank you! Mr. Kitano will donate $300,000 to the Association And will send his students here to exchange knowledge. Any objections? Lee Man Ho... killers in ambush You can leave now! How come? Let's get out of here first Come on! At 10:30 pm, the night of the murder, Ip Man came to my place We stayed up and chatted. He was drunk and so spent the night in my room Miss Cheung, are you telling the truth? Were you really with Ip man on the night of the murder? Your testimony is critical to the case If you're making things up, you could be arrested I swear the truth in my capacity as the Deputy Mayor's daughter However, I can't simply take your alibi and believe that Ip Man is innocent I need more supporting evidence More supporting evidence? Is my daughter's chastity not enough to prove his innocence? I guess I need the Provincial Governor to come and do justice Dad, don't be too upset. I had no alternative but to make up such a lie. I'm so sorry You sacrificed your reputation to rescue him; just to rescue a Kung Fu guy! You must marry my sister as soon as you can! Dad, don't get mad! Wing Shing! Sorry! I'm not worth it Worth it or not is only for me to decide I don't want you to marry me because of this Wing Shing! That's not what I mean, I want you to marry me I'll take you as my wife with an official ceremony and a grand wedding. Your father need not worry Mei Wai! Mei Wai! Mei Wai, why are you doing this? Did you kill my Godfather, Tin Chi? Do you work for the Japanese? Did you betray your own people for money, or for power? It's not as simple as you think It's hard to explain Mei Wai, please don't leave me! Listen to me I beg you. Please listen! What other lies do you want to tell me? You can't die, you'll be a mother soon But you've killed, you should give yourself in It won't work! It won't work! Listen! We should go somewhere we belong Where's the letter? Who came? Tell me, who came? No... Nobody Tell me who was here? Brother Chung So... he came to see me just now I've caused my brother enough damage, I don't want to involve Brother Chung So Where are you heading? I've done so much for your career advancement Dad even made Ip Man the culprit for your crime And you back out because of this lowly woman! I've done what you told me. What more do you want from me? Kill Ng Chung So; he's aware that you're working for us For you, and for us, whoever gets in the way should be eliminated I don't want to kill any more! This is not an option! Tin Chi! Don't hurt her! Tin Chi! I gave you my word on the honor of a samurai: You'll be free to leave after this mission Don't say that you haven't been given a second chance! How can I overcome him? If you can't do this alone, we'll form a brother and sister team Tin Chi, come out! Tin Chi, come out quick! We don't spare traitors in the Wing Chun Martial Arts School He's no longer your senior. Get him out here, now! Tin Chi! Tin Chi! I beg your forgiveness, Master. I've failed as a teacher and a leader Yiu Choi! Yiu Choi! Master! Ip Tin Chi, you traitor! That's no way to treat your fellow disciples Watch out, Man! I will! Kill him! Clear the way! I beat you up, not in revenge for being framed But to defend Lee Man Ho, the Master, and Dad's reputation Why did you turn traitor when you were so loved and respected by us? I'm not a traitor! I'm a Japanese sergeant, Tanaka Eiketsu I left my parents when I was twelve to become a spy in China I miss my country, I want to go home I couldn't even see my mother when she died I have yet to be able to pay my respects at her grave It might not be a bad idea to die now, so everything can be ended I'm a soldier, which leaves me no choice I'm relieved now as I've finally carried out my mission I don't need to hurt the people I love any more It's been a pleasure to be adopted by the Ip family and be your brother I have no regrets, as Mei Wai has been my wife Where's Mei Wai now? Ip Man... The essence of Wing Chun is to follow one's shadow, not his hand. Focus on what you feel rather than what you see Where's Tin Chi? I feel guilty; I wasn't able to keep his son Captain, these crates have just arrived. They are all Kitano's Open them for inspection! Where am I? Who are you? I want to go home There's one over here, too! Help him out Over here, too! Any water? Give them some! Will do! Easy, get him out! Dad, a beggar is unconscious outside Don't be afraid! Leave! Give them some water! At the critical moment, he arrived in a hurry with a long rod in hand, beating the hell out of the Japanese with the authentic Wing Chun 'half-past six' rod style However, his rod was slashed into two halves by your Uncle Tin Chi's Japanese sword Yet Tin Chi didn't let go, he pressed even harder... by attacking Ip Man with Karate and Judo How did my Dad react? He was very alert; he immediately used the two half rods like a pair of wing-shaped swords, and brandished them frantically, at times mixing in some unknown styles, styles difficult to identify, to beat his opponent These mixed movements, regardless of their authenticity, were not only powerful enough to win, but also good enough to save my life From then on, I stopped believing that martial arts schools should be segregated to maintain their own authentic styles My eyes were opened and saw a broader horizon I don't understand how Uncle Tin Chi picked up Japanese Kung Fu? Yeah! Why? Why? As a matter of fact, your Uncle Tin Chi... Why stop practicing? Dad! Go and do more training and practice. Hurry! Hurry! Let's go and practice! Telling stories again, Brother Chung So? You've gone over them thousands of times The thing is, every time it's a new story to them You're right! Children should know about their past Pay full attention when you practice. You are not allowed to eat before you're done Dinner's ready, Jun! Stop the training. Come and eat, everybody! Dad says I have to practise well before I can eat What's more important? Martial Arts or food? Food! Dad! All right! Take a good rest. Practise more after you eat Eat!
