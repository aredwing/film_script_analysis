Looks like you've completed nine months. No, l'm jjust in my eighth month. There's still one month left. l didn't ask your delivery date. l meant, is it necessary to stand in this queue with... ...so many people pushing you to watch this movie? Please put some sense into her She doesn't listen to me. She put herfoot down and brought me to this movie. l need to put some sense into you first. lnstead of making her stand in the queue... ...why don't you go and get the tickets? lt's easy for you to say that just look there. l will be dead if l go there. She will lose her husband but you'll be fine. Lord ama! Oh no! lt's so unpleasant to hearyou. Speak softly. Hey, l'm Lord ama! Chandram master! ou? No, l'm ayaprada. l felt like watching a movie with you. So, l discarded the sari and came in a shirt and trousers. Watch the movie, not me. l have a small doubt. What is that? Do you follow equality before law here? Listen, l'm in pain. es, when you watch NTR's movie... ...your hands are bound to pain with all the clapping. Not that pain. These pains? lt is jjust your eighth month, isn't it? Oh dear! Somebody please help. Come, tie a screen. Oh God! No, not my dhoti. He has nothing inside. What's the use of having it anyway? l will never become pregnant Shut your mouth and go out. Please be careful. Okay. Chandram, don't worry Nothing will happen. She is in labor inside How can nothing happen? Who are you? l'm Subramaniam, your neighbor. ABODE OF WlND Listen, you have a baby boy. l knew it when you pulled that man's dhoti... ...l knew it was a sign for a baby boy. Why is he so quiet? He came here before his time, didn't he? So, he might be wondering where he is. just a minute. l'll show you. This will be your plight all your life. ABODE OF WATER ABODE OF FlRE ABODE OF lNDRA What is this chaos? What is happening here? Kubera! Why do we have a natural disaster? Are the Gods of Wind, Fire and Rain... ...fighting among themselves for Rambha? l don't know, Lord. God of Wind, why are you upset? l'm not upset l was driven here by the wind. What is happening here, Lord? Even though we are sitting at home with no work... ...our own powers are turning against us. l don't know what's wrong. lf l stand up, l might be thrown into another world. One thing is clear. Adisaster has been created that will ruin us very soon. Since our own powers are turning against us... ...l think Lord Brahma gave our duties to someone else. There's no doubt about it Only he can do that. Let's go and ask him. Lord Brahma, how can you be so indifferent... ...when we are faced with such danger? He did what he wanted to and got the desired results. Now even thorns will be like a bed of roses for him. God of Wind! Why are you hurling accusations at me? Accusations? you should've told us, if you had anything against us. lnstead, you gave our powers to somebody else. We should know where we went wrong. God of Rain! Shut yourtaps. our sins are not responsible forthis chaos. There was a small mistake in my administration. Narayana! Greetings to the father! Father! What are we facing this distress? l'll break your teeth, if you make me angry. lnstead of using your spare time for good work... ...you caused all this trouble with your useless talking. just look at the confusion in all the worlds. What did l do, father? you didn't do anything, son you made me do it. Narayana! My greetings to father and mother. Father looks busy with some mindboggling matters... ...concerning the administration of his duties. es, son. l'm writing the destinies of Telugu movie poets... ...and their works that need to be sent to the earth. We need to send them for their deliveries. l have a small doubt Will you clear it for me? No, son. l don't want to rattle my brains after that. l know you very well Let me do my work. you may go. My doubt is about your work, father. What do you mean? ou've created many great poets like... ...Acharya Athreya Veturi and Sinare with your pen... ...and caused them to write amazing songs... ...and entertain millions of people. Even though your pen is so talented... ...why did you never pen a song for your wife? lf you write jjust one song for my mother... ...l'll see the happiness in her eyes. you can come to see that when l'm free. l'm not without any work like you you may leave. Listen to me, Sarasu. Sarasu... our happiness is going to cost me a lot. Sarasu, your mouth looks sweet when you are angry. l've nothing left but an angry mouth and runny nose. Sarasu, will you be happy, if l sing a song foryou? Will you rob my heart...? Will you rob my heart, my dear lady! l'll keep you safe in my eyes, my dear lord! The flower hit him and he was born without a destiny. He is immortal if he is born without a destiny, right? es, and he has powers equal to us. Whatever he wishes with his heart will definitely come true. Then we'll be ruined lf this is the case when he is born... ...what will happen when he finds out he has powers? Narada! Give me those wooden pieces. For what? To sing hymns. Was that ajoke? This is what happens, when you forget your duties... ...and get busy romancing your wife. Look at him, Narada. Earlier, lndra used to be afraid to look at me. But now he is poking fun at me. you caused this. you will... Calm down, father. Since l created the problem l'll give you the solution. What is that? you create humans But who takes away their life? Lord ama! He will help us correct this problem. God of Wind! Bring Lord ama to me immediately. Okay God of Wind! Are you deaf? you were asked to bring Lord ama not Chitragupta. Lord ama refused to come. He sent a message with me that he won't come. He refused to come? That's what l said you will have to... Chitragupta! He asked you to resolve your own problems. Bye! Calm down, father. l know very well howto bring Lord ama to our feet. Nowthis problem belongs to Lord ama, not us. That premature baby will be Lord ama's nightmare. YAMA lNCARNATE - Good morning, sir - Good morning. Naresh! es, ma'am. you are a teacher's son. Aren't you ashamed to get a zero in your test? No, you didn't give me marks. l wrote correct answers to all the questions. What is that correct answer? That l don't know. ou! Why are you screaming? ou'll understand the pain if someone does that to you. Mine will go farthest. Mine will go even farther. Mine will go way ahead! Look! lt's drizzling it might start raining heavily. es, when skin touches skin in the rains... ...your desire for love, becomes even more, come. Naresh... Why are you crying? Can't you pee like me? No, Bet Raja took away all my money. Really? Come with me. Why is it not raining? Why does rain water taste like salt water? ls it... Gross! l said we'll go to a movie. But you brought me to into these bushes. Bet Raja, bet! Two for one, fourfor two! ou'll lose a single or win a double! Bet Raja, bet! One rupee on Sridevi. One rupee on Sridevi! Sridevi won! Bet Raja, bet! Again Sridevi! 6 for 3! Keep them right there. Bet Raja, bet! Two for one, fourfor two! Again Sridevi! Bet Raja, bet! Bet Raja, bet! Again Sridevi! Bet Raja, bet! Bet Raja, bet! Again Sridevi! Bet Raja, bet! There's a stone in my throat! Take all the money Take it all away. How did Sridevi come so many times? Anyone will come if l call even Sridevi. Who are you? l'm Sridevi you called me jjust now, didn't you? - Did l call you? -es. Okay, come again after 5-6 years. -Why? - Then l'll have a mojustache. 'Do you think he's writing some lAS exams?' 'Not at all lntermediate, Batch No. 2002.' 'Now 2012. Headache of the home.' 'Talk of the whole town He's Mr. Naresh.' Did our son pass the exams? l'll make pudding. Forget pudding give him some poison. Pathetic! Did he fail again, uncle? There's no chance of me failing. l wrote well. Maybe it's a mistake. Dad, see the numbers before and after my number. Why? Did you copy from their papers? No, they copied from my paper. Even they have failed. Thank God! Even they have failed, right? you fool! you should have completed it in 2 years. But instead you've settled down there. All your classmates went ahead and got good jobs. Forget about them, dad. l'll kill you if you try to play yourtricks before me. Give me one more. Eat, my boy. How can you eat when l'm scolding you like this? Mom made such delicious breakfast that... ...even your scolding is not spoiling the taste. Why are you scolding this little boy? - ls he a little boy? -es. lf we had got him married he would've given birth... ...to ten more useless felloWS like himself. Ten? Come on, dad you are embarrassing me. you have no shame! When will you change? oujjust roam around with those useless people... ...in the name of dramas, the whole day. Pathetic! Don't worry about him just wait and watch. One day he'll definitely make you proud. He is becoming irresponsible because of your love. - Brother! -es? - l have a small doubt - Go ahead. We both are born to the same mother. Then why are you black and why am l fair? l'll break your bones if you mess with ancient writings. ls that the way to apply lipstick? l'm Sita, not Hanuman Do it correctly. Stop! What is he doing? ls he painting my wife's face... ...or, is he trying to impress her? He hasn't even got his first beard. ls there no limit for your suspicions? l'll be in trouble if she crosses her limits. She is not your wife so it's easy foryou to say. We can never trjust these drama people. Narayana! Man, how are you related to that woman? l'm her laundry man! She is my wife, so what? l had a doubt. Did she give you the rights to doubt as well? What's up? My doubt is... is Sita really your wife? Or, is she the wife of Rama that is sitting there? you are saved because you are in Lord Krishna's getup. Didn't l tell you she's my wife? Don't be upset Looking at the situation here... ...l thought he's her husband. lf you peacefully clear my doubt l'll be grateful to you. Okay, how should l clearyour doubt? you go and ask her to come home. lf she agrees, she's your wife lf she doesn't agree... l'll skin her if she doesn't agree. Let's go home. Why should l come whenever you call me? l have a drama l won't come, you go home. Let's go. l won't come. How dare you refuse? - l said l won't come - Let's go. - l won't come - Let's go. Did you see? What? Sita is gone? How?. es, her husband forcefully took her home. l meant, what will we do without Sita's character? l'm here. Narayana! Look at yourself in the mirror. ou'll be like a devil, if you dress up as Sita. Narada's character was not there in this episode. Then who is he? Why do you care? l have many girls like... ...Rambha, Urvashi and Menaka to do that role. Now l got it. Looking at your getup l thought you were an actor. But now l know you have many kinds of businesses. Narayana! l'm speaking of actresses in my drama group. l see. Oh! Drama group is a facade for your actual business. Why don't you believe me? Okay, call her. you call her. Won't she come if you call? l don't want to interfere in your business. lt will be better if you call her. Okay, dial the number. There's no need forthat just close your eyes... ...call out for amaja sincerely and wholeheartedly... ...and she'll come to you no matter where she is. What is he saying? Really? Okay, l'll try. ls she really a girl? Wait, let me check. Who are you? ou are Laxmana. you shouldn't look at Sita in that way. Can you look at her in that way? l'm Rama. By the way, where is that man that brought her? you are not an ordinary man. l don't know where you found her. But the girl is really beautiful. She appeared here with costumes when l called her. Did you set this up in advance? lt's my duty to start the drama at any cost. What? l meant you should start it. Are you starting a family instead of starting the drama? Audience! Silence! Silence! Silence! How long? 'Sita's Wedding' drama will start in a few seconds. Lift the curtains first. The first participant to break the bow is Ravanasura. l'll break the bow. Are you drunk? l would've come in the correct way if l was drunk. Hi! How are you? Oh God! Save me! The bow is so heavy Someone save me. This is crushing me. Come, and lift it up. Kiran! Why did you make the bow so heavy? Ravanasura would've died if not for Rama. Even this is heavy l'll talk to you... ...when you come to pay me this evening. Sri Rama who gives pleasure to the world... and beloved consort of Janaki Sri Rama who gives pleasure to the world... and beloved consort of Janaki Welcome to you, the glorious ruler! Sri Rama who gives pleasure to the world... and beloved consort of Janaki Welcome to you, the glorious ruler! Naresh! The response to the drama was amazing. Here is your money and your wife's money. l thought you had no hair Did you lose your brain too? l don't have a wife, do l? The girl that played Sita's role. All the viewers felt that she was your wife. They even asked for rice grains to bless you. Really? you should've organized a feast for them. you think l'll reduce the amount if you flatter me? ou'll start dressing up like a woman if l kick you hard. Give that to me. Husband! l'm talking to you, husband. Are you still in the character? Where is that clown that brought you? l don't know how much he asked for. Take these 1,000 rupees. What? lt is actually 800 rupees. But since yourfigure deserves a better figure... ...l gave 200 rupees extra. Have fun. Husband! What? you feel 1,000 rupees are less? Take another 100 rupees l can't give you anymore. What do you want? l want you, husband. Why are you calling me that? Am l your husband? you married me here before the five elements. This is a stage, not real life. Even life is a stage, isn't it? Don't use stupid logics Why are you following me? Actually, l should blame that stupid broker. 'l have many girls like Rambha, Urvashi, Menaka...' There's no doubt that this is his doing. He left herto me and disappeared. My life will be ruined if l don't deal with this carefully. Won't you leave me? Awife follows her husband, doesn't she? Really? Husband! Husband! Why is she following me like a TV reporter? Wait, husband! Wait, husband! Husband! Wow! you run quite fast. Athief that's in form, right? What did you steal? Achain? No, Russia. Was that ajoke? Does the great stage artist Naresh look like a thief? you look like a thief from all angles. Look, artists like me are like that water. We look like the character, the audience imagines. Let me give you an example. Since you are a policeman l look like a thief to you. lf you are a doctor l will look like a patient to you. Husband! Since she is my wife l look like a husband to her. - Let's go -es. Wife and husband. Thank God l'm saved. Let go off my hand. l like this, husband. l feel like my hand is in acid Let go off me. Shall we play a game now?. But we played a game earlier. This is another game Close your eyes. Count from 1 to 10 and open them. What then? l'll tell you First close your eyes. Okay. Finally l got rid of her. l need to relax immediately. Cheers! What? you needed a whole night to finish a beer earlier. Today you finished it in one sip Did he bite you? The girl that played Sita's role in the drama... ...thinks that she is really my Sita. That crazy girl is following me calling me her husband. She is driving me crazy. l took a bus and fled from there. Husband! l'm your husband! Come! How did you come here when l left you somewhere else? l followed you and got into that strange vehicle. She's got a great figure even though she is crazy. She's not a girl, she's glue. That's why she's comfortably sticking to you. Shut up! This is not a ladies bar you can't be here. Shakeela House, only for gents. Get out of here ladies shouldn't be here. Don't listen to him. Look howthey are ogling at you. l won't go anywhere leaving you. l'm ready to die with my husband. ou'll be in trouble, if you remain here. Still l won't go. Super! l'll drink this poison and die if you don't go. Don't drink the whole glass. My life is useless without my husband. Hey, that bottle costs 650 rupees. Oh dear! Hey... Oh noble man! You are my hubby Whether you like or not, l am your wife Oh noble man! You are my hubby Whether you like or not, l am your wife l've shed my shyness and longing for you Oh magician!

Oh noble man! You are my hubby Whether you like or not, l am your wife l've shed my shyness and longing for you Oh magician! Don't bid me farewell after garlanding me Husband... She's taking your name What does that mean? lt means she's sleeping. ou trapped her in the name of love. ou caught her hand in the name of marriage. But you left her after your work was done, right? Do l look like a white paper... ...that you can write whatever stories you like on me? l'll tear your face apart with one punch! No one knows why crazy people behave like this. Only they know of that art. lt's better if we maintain our distance with them. Let's go. - Let's go - Come on. He ruined the whole plan. - Hey! -Another drink. - Listen! -es? She's a poor girl it is winter and this is the centre. We can't leave her here. l'll take her to some safe place ou go ahead. Okay. Finally he likes her Didn't you get it? Husband... Sir! There's a girl. Madam! Oh God! Why did she come at this time? Where is madam? Not madam, sir. She's a girl. Someone that is not used to drinking left her here, sir. Should we take a peg and party, sir? Well, whetheryou want to party or participate... ...the boss comes first and then comes the staff. Should we call up the DGP? For what? He is boss to all of us, isn't he? Did you lose your brain because of ljust? l meant your boss, that's me. Let's take her inside and enjoy her beauty. Husband... Husband... Oh my God! Why are you hanging in air like batman? ou came at the right time, 201. Take the girl inside and enjoy yourself for 10 minutes. We finished jjust now. Thank you, sir. This is the batman story How is it? We got a shockjjust because we touched her. She's not an ordinary girl, sir. lf we don't send that devoted wife away, we'll be dead. She's really a devoted wife. -We'll leave her in the temple -es. Sir, l saw her with her husband sometime back. Who is her husband? ou think l'll give you money if you come... ...to beg wearing police uniforms? How dare you poke fun at policemen? Look there and you'll get the shock of your life. Oh God! Did you get a shock? Did you try to get rid of your devoted wife? Are you a human? l'm a human, but she is not my wife. What about him? No, he's not. 'Since she is my wife, l look like a husband to her.' Naresh, l thought you arejjust good on stage. But you try to fool everyone around you, right? Husband! Let go off me. lf you try to get rid of your devoted wife again... ...l'll file a case against you under domestic violence... ...l'll put you behind bars and force you to accept her. Start the car. Husband, where am l now? - On my neck. - Huh? Husband, is this our house? lt is my father's house. l'm entering my in-laWS house for the first time. So, l'll put my right leg first. ou don't have to do any of that. l'll cut your tongue if you talk about in-laWS house. Be silent. l don't know what to tell my family. Who is this girl? Actually, you told me our maid is... ...quitting work tomorrow, didn't you? So, l brought a new maid. But she doesn't look like a maid. ls that because of her dress and garland? Earlier, she worked for a very rich family. When she quit thatjob, they gave her new clothes... ...put a garland around her neck and gave a send off. Really? l'd rather believe a thief than believing you. How can you believe me when you don't love mother? She is sad that the maid is quitting. How can you talk like this instead of comforting her? How can you irritate her with questions like the CBl? just to save one month's salary... ...are you ready to trouble mom who has leg pain? Look into her eyes and tell me dad. Will you be happy to see her in pain? Stop your dialogues. ou are turning the house into a drama scene. This earth is a drama scene. There are no rehearsals here Only entries and exits. ou give answers that are not connected to my questions. And she doesn't stop crying. l've had enough ou do what you want. - Listen... -es? l think your brother married this girl in some temple. He is lying to us that she is a maid. ou think my brother did the same mistake l did? Oh God! Mom, please don't cry. l brought a maid foryou. Dear, the old maid's clothes are inside. Get changed. lt's already very late We have lot of work tomorrow. Go to sleep. Okay, mom. lt's all because of this garland. Why didn't you start doing the household chores? What do you mean by household chores? ls she really a servant girl? lt is new to her, mom. How can household chores be newto a servant girl? This girl is a thorough professional. She studies the clothes and washes them... ...without ruining their color orthe fabric. And she does all the work with great clarity. ou go inside. l'll personally make her do all the work. ou've played enough with me and them. Let's go. Where? Are we going out? No, we are going to do the dishes. Come on. Now do the dishes. What do you mean by that? Cleaning. What does that mean? ou are acting as Cleopatra to avoid doing dishes. l'll show you how to do them. First, tuck that sari at your navel. Navel? Where is that? lt is in the living room go and get it. Wait! Do l have to showthis as well? l finished tucking the sari now we'll do the dishes. Doing the dishes means to sit like this... ...scrub them like this and rinse them in water like this. - Did you get it? -es. - Now do all the dishes - But how? Darn it! l showed you jjust now, didn't l? Why do you ask again? ou showed me how to wash that one. But you didn't show me this one. Give it to me. Like this. Did you get it? l don't know how to wash this one. - Did you get it? -es. Don'tjjust say yes Do all the dishes again now. Don't play yourtricks with me Oh God! God, l cried when l was born like every other baby. But l didn't make you cry by wishing for big things. l jjust have one simple wish. Make sure that no one interferes in my hard work. Only then my devotion and your power will be balanced. Hail Lord Krishna! Sir, green tea. Sir, are you taking a nap? Should l increase the air conditioner? l'm not taking a nap l'm going into the flashback. Why do we want to kill him? What is the enmity between him and us? Does he actually deserve to die in our hands? Only when l rewind all these facts in mind... ...l'll understand if we need to take revenge or not. Move aside! Don't cry! Don't cry! - Hey! -es, sir! - Come here - Come on. because he is still unmarried. ou incapable men! This pathetic man first buys boats insures them and... ...then destroys those boats for the insurance money. Now he has started insuring the lives of our... ...sons and husbands for more insurance money. He is changing them into corpses. Hey, Royyala Naidu! May you be ruined! Sir, she is cursing you. We shouldn't worry about the sins of fishermen... ...nor the curses of sinners. What do you say, officer? es, but l'll worry about them. l'll expose all your sins very soon. This is the officer's house, sir. Very good. Not the house l meant that you balanced... ...my flashback time and the traveling time... ...very well with your driving. Who are you? l'm your distant brother. But l never saw you. Even l thought l'll never see you. But your husband made me see you. ls that so? Please have a seat, brother. ls the officer not at home? He is bathing Will you have some tea? Green tea. That's okay. just bring hot water, we have the tea bags. Okay. Anu, who was at the door? Sir is here. Why are you here? The doctor said green tea increases your life span. Sister, bring another cup Even your husband will drink. Why are you here? Don't take stress. Stress and screaming have, an ill-effect on your heart. Please sit, l'll tell you. lt is wrong to hurt the heart, isn't it? We'll sit peacefully and talk. Come, dear. lt's a personal matter Please go inside. We need to dip it well and then drink it. l'm like the vast sea. ou should use me but never play games with me. l told you to enjoy life with your wife and kids... ...without interfering in my business. But you said you'll drink green tea and die. What can l do? Sister, don't let kids touch these green tea bags. l mixed poison in them. 'l should get rid of her today at any cost.' ami, what are you doing? Husband! That man in the TV is my father. What? Collection King Mohan Babu is your father? Her madness is worsening every day. l thought only humans look like humans. Are there humans who like Lord ama as well? This is so strange, isn't it? ami, you wanted to go out yesterday. Shall we go? Go out? Are you going to Manasa Sarovaram? That's quite far. l'll have to sell my kidneys to go there. For now, we'll go to the exhibition. What does that mean? Exhibition is a place that has a display of variety of things. ls that so? Mother! Where are you going? l need to inform mother, right? No need. Mom and sister went to the market. They'll take time to come back. Should l adorn myself? ou don't have to adorn yourself. ou already look like an angel. Come! Throw a ring and get the thing! Throw a ring and get the thing! Husband! l want to try that. What? That man couldn't throw even one ring. How can you get it right? Sirs! Madam! Please come! Okay. Give me those rings. Here you go, sir. l don't know whose face l saw early this morning. l've incurred great losses. l don't want any of these. Playing is jjust fun for me but it is your livelihood. Earn some more with these things. Let's go. -ami! -es? Will you sit in the Giant Wheel? What is that? That big wheel. Come, get in. Bye! Come with me, husband. ou go round and round l'll watch you from there. Really? Okay. - Bye. - Okay. Mom, tea! Thanks, mom! ou? es, husband. l was so sad that you got lost there. What? l got lost? es. But l prayed in my heart that your love for me... ...will safely bring you home and came back. And that came true. Keep yourjoy aside and tell me this. How did you find the address and how did you come? l jjust followed the same route that we went. Darn your memory power! Why did you come back? Responsibilities l need to help mother and sister at home. When father and brother return from... ...school and office l've to serve them. l need to arrange for snacks for the kids. So l came early and finished all the work. Did you learn to do all this in a single day? l cannot digest that at all. - Husband... - Stay away from me. Are you angry that l left you there and came home? l know how to make that anger go away. Mother, something is happening outside. Please come quickly. - What is it? - Come on, l'll tell you. See for yourself. This is for you. For me? And this is foryou. What is wrong with you? That girl is lovingly feeding the kids. Why did you drag me here as if something is wrong? Mother, she was not feeding the kids. She was planting kisses on your son's cheeks. - Naresh! -es? ls she really a servant girl? - Why do you ask? - l saw her kissing you. ou are so funny. How can you see clearly without your glasses? What? Am l so blind? Who are you? our wife. l'll kill you if you say that. l almost got into trouble. Since sister didn't wear her glasses, l managed it. Otherwise you would've got me into deep trouble. ou can't be mad as you talk more cleverly than me. ou can't be trapping me for my immense wealth. Because my dad Chandram doesn't have any wealth. Why are you confusing a good kid like me? What is your concept? Why did you enter my life? Who are you? l'm amraja Lord ama is my father. Lord ama is your father? Where is he? -amapuri - Oh! Where is it? Besides lndra's world. -And where is that? - Besides Brahma's world. - ls Brahma your uncle? - No, Shani is my uncle. That's why you came as a bad omen to me. Go inside and serve your in-laWS. Okay. Oh God! She is totally crazy. l wish l meet her crazy father. Hey! l'm ama! ama! What? How can that be? How can this happen to the God of Death? How can this happen to the Ruler of justice? How can this happen to the King of amapuri? Why are you ranting these questions, Lord? Chitragupta, this is not ranting. l'm burning with anger that my daughter went to earth. ou are worried that she went to earth. But did you think about who sent her there? Who is that? None other than the man who creates contentions. Narada. Narada? es. Earlier, when Brahma requested you to... ...take up the case of a baby with no destiny... ...you totally ignored him Did you forget that? es. Narada took that case up and created trouble for you. Narada! Narayana! Narada! ou... Such vulgar language? He mjust've learnt it on earth. Why are you hurling abuses on me? Why did you send my darling daughter to the earth? ou... Lord, please calm down. l can understand your anger. But understand the reason behind my actions. lf you feel l was wrong you can do as you wish. Lord, l needed someone to play Sita's role... ...to solve the problem of that human. Sita was a very beautiful woman. l searched all the worlds for someone as beautiful as her. There was no one as beautiful as your daughter. He forgets the problem when he is praised.

Why is he upset? l did this so that he doesn't see sorrow at this age. Did l do anything wrong? ou did everything. ou did everything, father. l've lost enough from childhood. What did you lose? - Happiness, father -What? l've lost the smallest ofjoys because of you. Have you ever asked me what l like or don't like? ou always ask my friends about my likes and dislikes. These felloWS don't even understand my words. How will they understand your words, father? Please be my friend, father. l always say that, don't l? ou are upset because l said what you usually say. How upset l should be if you do what l should do? l'm tasting defeat everyday in order to give you victory. Why can't l see my father? Father! Father!

But if you give performances on the road... ...the same people will chase you and beat you up. She was chasing us because we saw something. What did you see? Wow, you felloWS are lucky. Why? Because we saw?. No, because you weren't caught by Silk Dada. Who is that? He is the husband of Silk Smitha you sawjjust now. What do they say about me and my knife in this area? They say your knife is jjust a showpiece. Was that ajoke? No, it's a fact. Dada! Dada! ln which area is she now?. After covering all the areas she got tired and went home. That's the information we got from our sources. Silk! They saw my body that l was guarding with my life. l didn't even let my husband see it properly yet. lt's betterto die than to be alive. Silk, your death won't solve this problem. l was talking about your death. Till you kill them, l won't apply oil to my hair... ...or soap to my boy That's my promise. Silk! l'll kill them and apply their blood to your hair. l'll cut out their hearts and turn them into bath soaps. lt's up to you where you want to apply them. ou can use this spray until then.

Chitragupta! l'm very hungry. ls that a stomach or a djustbin? ou've been constantly eating since we came here. Are you being sarcastic with me? Do you expect me to shower flowers? What did we come for and what are we doing? l don't care what you think l jjust love this earth. Wow, that's a lovely dress. By the way, what is this called? Lollypop. ls that so? Will you give it to me? ou should lick it not bite into it. So, you hold it like this and... Mom! My lollypop! What's wrong? What's the matter, dear? Thief! Thief! -Who are you? - Thief! He is running away. They think we are thieves. Come on run! Fast! He is running away. Catch him. What is this? Nobody ever ran from me like that.

Rip his clothes off and chase him in the city. Come on, go. Oh God! What a humiliation! Did you see what l'm capable of? How can l return to ama's world after this humiliation? - Silk Dada! - Long live! - Silk Dada! - Long live! What can l do if your wife comes in my all the time? Silk! ou'll definitely come to hell one day. l will torture you so much that you'll regret this. Oh dear! Give me your leg. The rickshaw man is here He's honking. Give me your leg. Mom, the shoe is biting me. What? ou feel that when you wear new shoWS. ou always make a scene before going to school. Be quiet. Don't make noise. Why is she crying? She's playing tricks to avoid going to school. l'll give you a tight slap. Come on. The shoe is biting me. Don't cry. l said don't cry. - lt's hurting me. - Bye. What is this? ou can clearly see that Royyala Naidu... ...is cheating us in the name of insurance policies. Why didn't the previous officers file a case? They tried doing that. That's why they became previous officers. And you became the new officer. Hello! What? Ascorpion bit her? ou get the kids ready for school every day, right? Don't you have the common sense... ...to check the shoes before making the kids wear them? Look what happened now. l should've known that if l treat a servant girl... ...like a family member she'll forget her duties. Pathetic! Don't worry. She is out of danger ou can see her. - Thank you, doctor. - Thank you, doctor. What is this, amaja? l got the kids ready for school today, didn't l? Mom scolded you because she didn't know that. But you didn't speak a word. When you were becoming close to everyone... ...with your goodness l thought my l'll lose my value. l never tried to understand you please forgive me. Sorry. amaja, why were you silent when it wasn't your fault? What happened today was jjust a mistake. Scolding me or sister for it would be the same. Did you feel hurt? l'm not a neighbor to feel hurt, husband. Husband, what are you looking at? The moonlight lt looks beautiful, doesn't it? Moonlight is always beautiful. But my eyes never saw its beauty till today. Now l can see it clearly. Really? l tried to get rid of you all these days. But now l feel l can't lose you. Okay, tell me where you father is. l'll call him up and say that you'll be with me forever. My father doesn't have a phone. Even beggars have i-pads these days. By the way, what does your father do? He punishes the bad people. Oh, he is ajudge. Now l got it. ou love dramas jjust like me. But your father hates them jjust like my father. So, one day you both had an argument. And the next day you ran away from home, right? amaja, what's wrong? l miss my brother. That means l have a brother-in-law. He loves me very much. He can't stay without me orfood. Where is he now?. - Chitragupta! -es? l love these lollypops. We'll take 100 lollypops when we return to ama's World. He's a lollypop and his father is a fool. l heard that. ou heard it but didn't understand it, right? Stop your nonsense. l need, to rest now. l'll lie down here. This is called a road Vehicles and dogs run on this. l'm not scared of them. They might get scared of you and attack your vital parts. My vital parts? ''l have what you want.'' He says he has what we want Let's ask him. He's coming to us. Do you have what l need? That's right in your mouth. l'll break your skull. l need matches. What are matches? - Fire - Fire? Human, if you show us a place to rest... ...l'll give you matches. - Really? -es. There! There? Let's go. Wait! What about my fire? That smells disgjusting. Wow! -young yama! -yes? This place looks good for resting. Chitragupta! Who are they? just as we have guards of death in our world... ...they have protective guards in this world. Why don't they have horns? They don't need horns they jjust need money. Oh... Chitragupta! l didn't see this toy in any other world. What is this? This is that man's weapon. What does he do with it? lf you put your finger in the ring and pull the trigger... ...lots of lollypops come out from this hole. Lollypops? Why didn't you tell me sooner? Chittu! These lollypops have no taste. They tastejjust like grass. Who are you? Ganda! Yamaganda! What do you want? We need a place to sleep. you should be a policeman like me... ...or a criminal like him to sleep here. Who is a criminal? A person who picks pockets, steals chains... ...does eve teasing and kidnapping... ...or at least beats up the person before him. l like the last option very much. How dare you hit me? One, two... He's going around like a wheel Blow him away. l'm the future yama! Oh God! The same reaction. They are definitely related to that devoted wife. Naresh! Open the door. Who are you guys? Why are you disturbing us at this hour? Did you lose your mind like our town's lnspector? What did you say? Sir! How did you get hurt? Did someone get drunk and beat you up? Or did they plant a bomb? New members of yourfamily entered... ...and closed all the entries of our bodies. - My family? - Take a look. Their faces look familiar. Human, it's us this morning we hid behind you... ...when those people were chasing us. Will they become my family members... ...because they hid behind me? Not for hiding or anything else. We brought them here to avoid further trouble. l don't care about all that. Have a look Do our genes match in any way? We don't care if the jeans, or underwear match or not. The shock treatment that the girl gave earlier... ...and the shock treatment they gave today match. That's why we brought them here. - Sister! - Brother! Sister! How are you? - Brother! - Sister!

Who are these men in disguises? Are they from your drama company? No, dad. He is my brother-in-law. l mean, he is this girl's brother. l don't know who he is. l know. l'm Lord Yama's right hand. Why is he talking like that? He hasn't come out of his character yet. l thought you were the only fool. But looks like there are many like you. Why did they come here? For my sister. Do you have to come at midnight to see your sister? We started this morning in Yama's world But it became night by the time we reached here. He is out of his mind. Looks like they didn't eat anything since morning. Dear! Take your brother inside and give him food. Okay. Keep this mad man out of the house. Feed him here and make him sleep here. Come in, brother. Padma! l opened new toothpaste yesterday. But l can't see it today. l think you need to get your eyes tested. you fool! l said there is no paste in this tube. Forget about the paste that you opened yesterday. l opened a new soap and it disappeared... ...by the time l got my towel. Notjjust the soaps, all the breakfast l made is gone. All the monthly groceries in the kitchen are gone too. l think some thieves stole them. Why will those thieves need my medicines? They took them as well. How can they rob our house when l'm here? There's no chance for that. Our Yamaganda did all this not any thieves. Did he sell all those things? No, he ate them. No matter what your guest eats at your home... ...it comes under hospitality. But he even ate the sash gourd that we hanged... ...at our doorpost to save our house from evil eyes. What is happening here? Any human will have breakfast in the morning. Why is he eating medicines soaps, and toothpastes? He will eat anything as long as it is eatable. Where is that glutton? l think he has a cleaning liquid in his hand. Sister, this is delicious. But this liquid is even better. Oh God! That is a cleaning liquid. Oh no! Did you drink that liquid like a fruitjuice? ou'll die, you fool. ou'll die. There's no need to worry. He can eat and digest anything. - Really? -yes. Dear, if he continues to stay in our house... ...we'll have to beg alms forthe rest of our lives. Send him away immediately. There's no need forthat l'll leave myself. Sister, let's go to our home. Oh no! l think he'll end my love story. l can handle my dad later on. But for now l'll have to make sure this fellow stays here. Brother-in-law! you can call me with any name you like. But l don't want you to call me brother-in-law. But l like you That's why l brought you here... ...so that you can have fun. ou can buy whateveryou want l'll pay for it. - Listen... -yes? Beautiful cheeks. Adelicate nose that reddens when you smile. Lips that are like petals of a red rose. Tiny waist that attracts your attention. He is praising him and touching her. Stop it...l'm nothing like you described. He was praising your sister. es. Who gave you the right to praise my sister? -you. - Me? How?. Like that. Oh God! How does he know my weakness? Look, you can't buy me with ice-cream. Won't you eat it if l buy it for you? No one in my family takes a back step. Let's go. Come on. l don't have change, Lord. - Hey... -es? ou stay right here l need to speak to you in private. Okay. Give two ice-creams. Okay, sir. Hello! The ice-cream should be chilled. Close your mouth l can see your spinal cord. ou can eat as many as you want. l'll pay you. - Okay, sir. - Enjoy yourself. l said l'll pay you after he finishes eating. He finished eating, sir. That's okay. Give him two more. He ate all of them, sir. All? ou said you'll buy me a big ice-cream. Why are these so tiny? Are these the ice-creams? ou deceived me. l want some more. Oh God! l need to divert him with mind, not food. Come with me, l'll tell you something. Get your hands off me. Are you your sister's only brother? l'm also the only son to my father. So what? l think there's one more like you. ou think l'll believe you so easily? l trjust my father. - But l don't trjust him. - Lord Yama! l'm asking him who it is. How will l knowthat? He looks exactly like you l saw him hiding... ...in that swimming, pool after seeing you. Lord, if he is exactly like you he'll come to... ...ask for a share in the kingship of Yama's World. ou saved me. l'll bury him in the same water right now. l'm coming for you Where are you? es! Chitragupta! - l'm coming, Lord - He looks exactly like me. So this is the work that my father comes to do... ...on the earth from time to time. Hey, who are you? How dare you talk like that to me? l'm coming to get you! God, give me strength! Now show yourself to me. Lord, chop him up into tiny pieces and feed the fish. Okay, Chitragupta! What? This man looks like me. He removed his cap when l removed my cap. Lord, l think your father and my father came to this... ...earth behind our backs and fulfilled their desires. Now l'll teach him a lesson. Hey! l won't spare you. l'm my father's favourite l'll destroy you today. - l got him. - l got him. Oh God! They saw me again! - l didn't do anything. - They saw me again! l've seen her before. Chitragupta! ls she the same woman that... ...we saw in the bathroom and then in the shopping mall? They saw me again. ou show everything to the world and nothing to me. Go inside now. How dare you touch my wife before my eyes? Shut up! our wife was romancing someone under water. We pulled her up He looks exactly like you. See if he is your brother. Oh God! He looks jjust like me. Father! When did you do this mistake? He looks exactly like me. Brother! l won't spare you because you are my brother. He doesn't knowthat his life will be in danger in water. But we know that. Let's go. Finally l got a chance to speak to you in private. l think my heart will die, if l don't tell this to you. l'll tell you. l'm going to tell you. l love you. Oh girl! With pistol like body You shot my heart with your bullet eyes Lost my control, baby My heart became holey Oh girl! With pistol like body You shot my heart with your bullet eyes Lost my control, baby My heart became holey You made me feel crazy Touched and made me softy Stay with me And l'd dance in the air l'll be your man if l am born again Would pray to God for that lf l have this pretty as my girl l'll live for a 100 years When l have this great beauty near me l am in a dilemma to cross beyond limits Explore her daily The milky beauty is for you Rob pleasures from me non-stop No restrictions for you, my beau On her slender body, is written my name Seeking me She has joined me Stay with me And l'd dance in the air l'll be your man if l am born again Would pray to God for that lf you are a knife, l'll stab myself Though it is pain to lose my life l'll fondle and care you like a baby despite peoples'gags You're brimming with love now Announce it for the people to know lf you feel hungry Would offer my beauty to taste Won't leave you even if you thrash me or kick me out l'll stay on your forehead as Kumkum Stay with me And l'd dance in the air l'll be your man if l am born again Would pray to God for that 'After considering all these evidences, it is proved that...' '...the accused Royyala Naidu has killed many fishermen...' '...for his business. So, under lPC sections 302 and 420...' '...the accused is, given a life sentence. They have been... Officer! l might've gone to the temple a couple of times by mistake. But l've never been to a court before. ou forced me to come here. ou handcuffed the hands that gave you a bouquet. Time is on your side. But l'm like a cobra. l'll balance it out very soon. Chittu! ou said we'll find a way to save my sister... ...from that human. But l can't see anything here. ou are fool! Finding a way is not as easy as finding an onion. We should go stealthily and take your sister away. There she is. Let's go. Don't make any noise. Come on. l'm feeling homesick. lf we travel another ...you, me and your sister will be in yama's World. - Oh no! -What? Chittu! My sister has changed. People in love do change. ou fool! She is that human's sister-in-law, not my sister. Let me see. Let me sleep. Why are you both besides me? ou were floating in air, so we are trying to stop you. Oh God! Why am l floating in the air? That's what l said. These days it's fashion... ...to lose a lot of weight to become size zero. What? Did l lose so much weight? Did l become a size zero? Oh God! Thank God! She fainted for good. We'll take her down before she wakes up. Chittu! My sister usually sleeps here. How did she come here? She might've lost interest in her husband... Sister... She felt hot inside as there was no power. So she came and slept here. ou switched off the power, didn't you? l know that you came here to take me back with you. But l can't leave my husband. This is my in-laws place, your brother-in-laws place. l won't accept that human as my brother-in-law. lf that's the case since l'm that human's wife... ...l'm not related to you anymore. Sister, don't say that l won't be able to bearthat. Brother, there are inter-caste and inter-religion marriages. ls it wrong to have an inter-world marriage? Even though our mother was from heaven... ...she became the daughter-in-law of yama's world. lf she hadn't done that, you and l... ...would never have been a brother and sister. We wouldn't have had this headache as well. Brother, try to understand your sister's heart. Chitragupta! My sister's happiness is more important for me. ou go back and l'll stay with my sister. Hey, stop chanting your sister's name. ou'll father will skin you if you don't go back. l'm Lord yama! Are you upset? ou are a man that has no affection for anyone. Why should l listen to you? All the worlds should unite to separate me from my sister. ou can do what you want to. Even his father didn't abuse me so badly. What will you say now?. l have lots of lollypops. Sister, will you come with us or not? How can l ask her that? No, l won't come. Go and tell our parents that l'm safe. Give that to me. Okay, sister. We'll take your leave. - Greetings. - Bye! Where is your brother? l didn't see him since morning. He had come for me. But l sent him away foryou. Husband, you said you have something important to say. l wanted to tell that to you in this sacred place. Let's go. Husband, what are they doing? They believe that if they tie their desires... ...in the form of a bundle on that tree... ...Goddess will fulfill them That's why they are doing it. Come on. Why are you tying that bundle? ou mjust've wished for something important. es. l wished that my in-laws family should be... ...happy and prosperous for all eternity. When l put this garland in your neck that day... ...you accepted me as your husband. Today l consider this garland as a wedding chain... ...and take you as my wife before the five elements. l'll introduce you to my family as the... ...younger daughter-in-law of the house. Come. Greetings to my father! He entered as a comic villain in a cartoon movie. ls he yourfather? l thought he was ajudge. ls he a part of our drama company?

'l left you far away How did you come here?' 'l followed you and got into that strange vehicle.' 'That man in the TV is my father.' 'ls Brahma your uncle?' 'No, Shani is my uncle.' Yamaja, l didn't come to the earth... ...to prove to this foolish man that l'm Lord yama. l came here to take you back. Father, l can't leave my husband to come with you. ls that so? Father, give my yamaja back to me. Otherwise l won't let you go. Human! l will go up because l'm yama. Let's go. NO RESTFOR YAMA Hey, Human! Usually yama folloWS the humans. But why are you following yama? Let go off the tail! l won't let go off the tail, if you don't give me my yamaja. Howfar will you come like that? l haven't decided that yet. But l've decided that l'll come any distance for my yamaja. ou fool! Have you gone mad? This is love, not madness. Why will you know about love, father? lt starts in the heart and fills the body with power. No matter how many villains like you attack... ...love will win in the end. l don't think this human will let go.

We sages are used to doing that. Sage, where am l? ou are here, son. l meant, what's the name of this colorful desert? This is Trishanku Heaven, son. Heaven? ls there where Rambha, Urvashi... ...and Menaka do cabaret dances? Don't get too excited, son. That heaven and this heaven are totally different places. This is Trishanku Heaven.

That is my question l'm a great sage, son. l have power to come and go anywhere l want to. There is no logic. But there is something behind your coming here. Wait a minute. ou are God's offering, son. By God's offering, do you mean... ...Milk Pudding, Lime Rice and ogurt Rice? l'm not talking about offerings that are eatable, son. God's offering means God's gift. l am God's gift? Oh God, that sounds very serious. Can you please give me the details? ou are a man that doesn't know fear. our shout will be like a thunder. ou are a trend setter not a trend follower. ou didn't die and come here. ou came here to make yama's World dance.

How do l reach yama's World? Very simple. ln your world, there are four directions and several ways. But here there are only two ways. The earth is down and yama's World is up. Really? How should l go to yama's World now? Don't ask me questions? our love has the powerto show you way. Wish for it with sincerity. ou will reach your destination. Go! Thank you. Narayana! Where is he? The Lord looks very happy after a long time. Did you show your strength on madam after a long gap? Hey! l'm happy because l got rid of that stupid human... ...on the way and brought my daughter back home. l agree that you got rid of him. But can your daughter stay without him? Can you really stop her? What did you say? There's nothing l can't do. That's why l shut her up in a secret place. What is it? ls it applause for my victory? Enough of your laughing. lt was a quake that said that the human is here. My dear father! As this place is new to me... ...you thought l'll get lost like a kid in the market, didn't you? ou are in my world you can't escape from here. What? Who said anything about escaping? l'm not leaving this place without yamaja. What did you say? ou can do that if you know where my daughter is. First find her and then you can take her with you. ou can do nothing but talk. What did you say? Did you say l can't do anything? This is a test of love not a test of proving yourself. But if you insist let me tell you something. our daughter left your world and came to earth for me. Why didn't you do anything then? Forget that you sent your son and Chitragupta... ...to bring back your daughter that fell in love with me. Why didn't they do anything? How can you challenge me? ou came on the buffalo to kidnap your own daughter. What were you able to do at that time? Without any vehicle facility or a passport... ...or a trip to the airport didn't l catch hold of the animal's tail... ...and travel through the other worlds to come here? Didn't you see what l can actually do? Now you are asking me to find my darling that you hid. l'll do that and defeat you completely. Any doubt? ou have the past but l have the present and the future. Hello! Even defeat is yours, father. My coming here is your first and present defeat. He is the right man! l'll see you later. Oh no! This man made even Lord yama dance to him. lf he catches me my garland will fall to the ground. Control yourtummy, uncle. Chitragupta! -yes, Lord? - Why is that human so overconfident? He is an extraordinary human, Lord. He doesn't have enough flesh in his body. But he has love foryour daughter... ...and the courage to make her his own. Those two weapons are enough to give him victory. That's impossible! lt is possible. Narayana! This is not the time to get angry or scream. lt is better to be patient. What did you say? What did you say? Did you forget what will come after... ...the tenth day from today? - Eleventh day - Stop your calculations. Am l wrong? l didn't ask the number Which day is that? Sunday, a New Moon day. So? Since that human has the same powers as us... ...you can do nothing but hear when he speaks or argues. But did you forget that this New Moon day... ...Gods of Eight Directions are going to unite their powers? So what? Give that human, a taste of your power. Until then, that human will make him dance to his tunes. yes, even if he dances or makes you dance... He needs to shut his mouth and sit. Chitragupta! He said that, Lord. Narayana! This looks like a family pack. Who is she? She's equally beautiful as my darling. Why is such a glamorous woman in this frame? ls she an aunt? Maybe. l need to change this aunt into an antenna... ...that will telecast my love program successfully. Who is it? l'll tell you that But ladies first. Who are you? l'm Lord yama's... ounger daughter, right? l correctly recognized that you are amraja's kid sister. No, l'm not yamaja's kid sister. Are you her older sister? ou don't look older to her Please tell me the truth. Are you kidding me? No, l'm Lord yama's wife, Aiyo. Oh God! Oh dear God! What's wrong? Such a beautiful and delicate woman... ...like you is Lord yama's wife? Oh God! This is totally unfair! Sons of Gods! Sages! Angels! ls there nobody to question this? All of them went to do their duties. ou were born in a wrong place, mother. Had you been born on our earth... ...you would've been a top heroine. K. Raghavendra Rao wasn't fortunate enough to cast you. Otherwise he would've hit you with... ...all varieties of fruits and flowers in all the body parts. Why is that? To showcase your glamour, mother. All young directors will fall at your feet foryour call sheets. Hmm. Does that mean a yes? That wasn't a yes, it was a sigh. lt doesn't suit you, mother. The sound of a sigh doesn't suit your skin tone at all. How are you staying with that hard-hearted man? Do you know what you've lost because of him? l know. But what's the use? A bud will blossom into a flower. Can a flower turn back into a bud? ou used a clever dialogue that can't be censored. ou are a beauty with brains. Father is pressing you down with his cunning character. ls he pressing me down? yes, mother. l'll give you an example. Mr. Brahma gave his wife Saraswati... ...a lotus to sit on and his wholehearted love. -What about Manchu Vishnu? -What? l mean your Vishnu. ln every form he takes he has his wife besides him. es. Lord Shiva turned his life partner Paru... ...into half his body and gave a new life to concept of love. es. All Goddesses are in the top positions... ...and are being worshipped by people. ou don't have any temples or coconuts as offerings. How can you bear this? What else can l do? lf we dig up the past... ...we'll be left with nothing else than ditches, son. That's right. But how did you know that l'm your son-in-law?. Because you lovingly called me mother so many times. ou have blessed me even though... ...he didn't accept me as his son-in-law. That is enough for me, mother. But he hid my yamaja somewhere. ou might knowthe place Please tell me. l don't knowthat, son. l haven't seen my daughter from a long time. l'm worried about her. ou don't worry, mother. lf l apply pressure on father... ...he'll definitely give out the details about yamaja. Please bless me, mother. l'll see you later. Aiyo, how did that human come here? He came through the door. Why did you let him come? Why didn't you throw him out? Did l ever throw you out? No. But l'm your husband. He's my daughter's husband. Oh! Hey, listen... Wives are the same in any world. They never listen to their husbands. l should be careful as that Narada said. l shouldn't let even a thread enter my doors. What did l do? Why did you bring me to yama's World? By the way, who is here? oung Lord is here. Who? Chandra Babu Mohan Babu or Bali Babu? None of them He is our younger Lord. younger Lord? Please come. Did you forget me, son? yes, l got it. l dressed you up as a woman in the shopping mall, right? yes, Silk Dada. Did you die before me and come here? you died and came here. yama's World is Lord's native place. He is the son of Lord yama. What? ounger Lord yama? l'm very sorry, Lord. l didn't knowthat you are a citizen of yama's World. So, l humiliated you on the earth. l liked the way you humiliated me on the earth. So, l've decided to bestow honor on you here. Honor? Lord, you are not like the other lords. lt's like Karna was born to Lord yama. - Guards! Prepare to honor him. - Do it quickly. Please come, Silk Dada. - l'm coming. -Welcome. What is this waterfor? ln yama's World, you need to bathe before being honored. you need to bathe with perfume. - ls this perfume? - Of course. Then young girls will bathe me right? Call them. We don't have girls here. Bring the mug. Why do you walk as if you are carrying a corpse? our mug. Why did you give me a spoon? you should bathe with that. Are you out of your mind? yes, l'm out of my mind. This spoon has a hole. you need to bathe with that. l don't want your honor. if you don't like it. Tell me whom l should hit. you will be hit with a whip. Now l understood that you'll honor me with revenge. That's right. Oh God! yes, enjoy the whipping. l'm very happy today. That's enough, fat fellow. Sinner! l saw your wife on earth by accident. But you've tortured me so much for that. That was your earth But this is my world. Torture him! Father! ou hid my darling jjust like... ...the Maoists hide atom bombs. That funny man caused all this trouble. He is such a fool. Dangerous! Dangerous! Hello, Muni Sharma! Stop! l'm not Muni Sharma l'm Michael ackson. Michael ackson? ou are dressed like him. But something is definitely fishy. Nothing is fishy, man l'm purely Michael. Narayana! Narayana? l caught you! Narada! l'll break your bones. Even if you dress up, a rickshaw as a Benz car... ...it will still be a rickshaw. Sorry. What is your problem? There are heroes like Pawan Kalyan and Mahesh Babu... ...on the earth Then why did you choose this... ...Allari Naresh to be the hero in your movie? Actually, l was curious to see what happens... ...when the earth and yama's World become relatives. When l was searching for the leading man... ...l thought you would suit the role very well. Why are you going around in disguise? What can l tell you? l was the director for all the past episodes. l was afraid that Lord yama and you will beat me up. lf we were on earth l would have fed you to the dogs. But l won't do that now because... ...you got me a superb marriage proposal... ...that no marriage bureau could've offered. lf you want to be totally free you've to do me a favor. What is that? you have to tell me where my yamaja is. l don't have another option. Lord yama hid his daughter in his own weapon... ...so that nobody can see her or bring her out. Oh God! He looks like a malnourished man. But he is very intelligent. ls there no way l can meet yamaja? - There are two ways. -What are they? Option one, you go in Option two, she comes out. That's so foolish. l need herfather's entry pass for both the options. ou don't need a pass if you attack on his weakness. Really? What is that weakness? Lord! This sinner's name is Mrs. Kanya. She trapped many rich men with her beauty... ...made videos of their ljustful activities with her... ...and looted them of all their wealth. lt is not wrong to give her the severest of punishments. Send herto heaven without any punishment. Lord? She gave heavenly pleasures to many men. lt is only fair to send her to heaven. She did business with her body to gain profits. That is fair. The law changes for ladies. Send herto my room before sending her to heaven. For what? l need to teach her some important things. Wow! Travelling on the buffalo made him like one. l'll become a female to play with your weakness. Mr. Narada, dress change. Chitragupta! l can see golden pumpkins behind those bushes. They are not pumpkins... She is a beautiful young woman. No, Chittu! She's a big woman. Hey, when l am walking in the street with flowers in hair bun, finger on my cheeks Kevvuu Kekaa The entire street is going crazy Lord, she's hot. Who are you looking for? l'm looking for a thief who stole an important part. Who is that thief? Lord yama! - Lord yama? ls he a thief? - Hey! Don't you know him? l know him very well When he robbed my heart... ...l captured his image in my eyes... ...and stored it in all the parts of my body. When did that disgjusting incident take place? ln my dreams. Why didn't you recognize him when he's right before you? No, he's not that man. Since her eyes were closed while dreaming... ...she is not able to recognize me. No. just like the three faced lion on one rupee coin... ...l remember his face very well. He looks like NTRwith thick curly hair in a well fitted suit. Beauty! Don't worry l'll fulfill your desire. No, you can't satisfy me. l meant that l'll fulfill your desire... ...by sending Lord yama to you. l'm so happy to hearthat. Come to my garden at the same time tomorrow. Okay. Forget him, come to my guesthouse... - Chitragupta! - l'm coming. Notjjust on earth even here women have no freedom. Do l look like NTR in this getup? Why to compare him with you? yes, l'm incomparable. ou understood it that way? es. Chittu no one should knowthis secret. The secret about this suit? No, my encounter with that beauty. Oh! - Will my Sir come searching me? - He'll definitely come - Will he give me his heart? - He'll give me undoubtedly - Will my Sir come searching me? - He'll definitely come - Chitragupta! -es? - Go and hide behind those bushes. -What about you? l'll impress that beauty with my words. l'll measure her with my eyes. l'll embrace her in my arms and... Go ahead. - Lord! -es? lf you permit me, even l want to do that. No! Only yama! Come, father! l'll make you dance with my beauty. Priya! That same voice. He had that same disgjusting voice earlier as well. Darling, l'm here. He's afraid that she'll fall for me. What's the matter, darling? When l saw my dream man before my eyes... ...l lost control of myself and fainted. What did you say? Since you desire me l left everything behind... ...and came to you to fulfill your desires. l hope l won't get pregnant. No way. He got a vasectomy. Nothing will happen to you, Priya. My name is not Priya. l forgot to ask your name. Because you were filled with ljust. -What is your name? - Katrina Kaif. Notjjust your body even your name is so beautiful. Naughty boy! Wow! - Darling! - Naughty! l think he'll get tired with all the running. Wife on one side Kaif on the other side. Lord! Stop! l can't stop. l said stop! Chitragupta! l didn't mean to disrespect you, Lord. our wife is coming this way. Kaif! Go quickly and hide. - Shall l hide here? - No. Are there no rooms here? This weapon is the right place. What are you saying? l'll suffocate to death inside that. Kaif, jjust see what l can do. Oh God! The exterior was jjust one meter and a half. But the interior is one kilometer long. Where will l search for my yamaja? Aiyo! Who are you? How dare you address me as my husband? ou'll turn to ashes if l curse you. Aiyo! l'm your husband look carefully. What is this getup, my Lord? l got to knowthat a sinner escaped from prison. So l came in this disguise to catch him. That's it. Why did you come here at this hour? What kind of a question is that? ou sent a messenger and asked me to come here. Me? Oh, yes! l felt that l was neglecting you because of my duties. So, l planned to spend this day with you. l found you. Hi! Who are you? l'm your lover's lover. He came to this world foryou but l came for him. Stop it! He is my husband. l'm his future wife. What did you say? lf you say yes we three can live happily together. What? ou with my husband? Husband! What is this disgjusting getup? - Don't l look good? - No. You're the Man of courage and caliber This flowery beauty is yours, accept it You are the star in the sky and flow of love Pleasantries arrive, come and join me Taste the nectar, oh honey-bee! To fulflll the desires in me l'll come and join with you You're the Man of courage and caliber This flowery beauty is yours, accept it Oh my star! Getting aroused by the feelings The beauty found its company Making love with you slowly Will take you to the magic world Getting aroused by the feelings The beauty found its company Making love with you slowly Will take you to the magic world Luck knocks at the door of mine l'll come and join as your pair l crossed the limits of the world You are my breath of life Oh my dear...! You're the Man of courage and caliber This flowery beauty is yours, accept it Oh my star! Don't know why my mind gets disturbed Sorrow...anger...wrath Would lose them with my hug Don't know why my mind gets disturbed Sorrow...anger...wrath Would lose them with my hug The dame is ready For the game is about to start Come, my beloved! l'll get rid of your sorrows My mind and body fly on high Never experience this before The festival day has come l was waiting so long l am a pious girl; have only your thoughts and admire only you in my mind l'll stay in you as the moon-light And bring the joy and happiness l'll be your better half, and live many a births - Chitragupta! -Wait a minute. Narayana! Narada! ou? How is Lord's romance? This couple looks so good in different postures. lf an older couple can be so romantic... ...l'm sure the younger couple inside the weapon... ...mjust've crossed all their limits. The younger couple inside the weapon? But they both are women. ou don't have to bite your tongue or nose. l know everything. you know it? Does that mean that Lord is in trouble? The trouble has jjust started. The person inside the weapon is... ...not a young woman that caught Lord's attention. That person is the human that yamaja loves. The one that will teach your Lord a lesson. The one inside is not Katrina? No, it's him. As soon as your Lord sees a sari... ...he pounces to embrace it without checking... ...if it's really a female or a male. That human is with yamaja inside the weapon. - Really? - Lord! Are you out of your mind? lf you'll lose your mind after hearing this. The one inside is not Katrina it's him. Lord, what's the matter? Dear, you go home. l have information about that sinner. l need to go and punish him. Hey, Human! l think yourfather knoWS. What is it, father? Did you go into a shock when you found out that l'm here? ou could go inside by fooling me. But you cannot come out. ou are proud thinking that you've captured me. But you are forgetting that l'm in your daughter's arms. We didn't go to honeymoon after our wedding. My body is craving for her. Lord, he is a man full of desires. He'll get to work and make you a grandfather very soon. l mean, even your daughter doesn't seem to mind. lt would be better to bring them out. Father, do you know something? Love is like a lucky draw. Not everyone gets it. But you can't stop someone from getting it. So stop your nonsense book a grand function hall... ...and arrange for a marriage reception party for us. All the worlds will applaud both of us... ...you for making me your son-in-law... ...and me for marrying your daughter. Hey, l'm yama! l'm Naresh! l'm Chitragupta! Enough of the stupid introductions. ours is not love, it is deception. Don't be so happy because you've won with deception. ou'll be ruined because l'll win tomorrow! l heard you Now l'll give you a super challenge. ou will agree that my love is true love. ou will give your daughter's hand to me. ou will wash my feet. That's a challenge. That won't happen even if l die. ou don't die, you kill others. Hey, no logic. l won't let that happen at any cost. lt will definitely happen. Why did you bring me here? Are you going to whip me again? We'll show you a cricket match. Cricket? l want to play. Our Lord will play with you. No one ever won a match against me. Our Lord has never lost a match. What's the bet? lf you win, you can go back to earth and be with your wife. l like that. What if l lose? l'll go to earth and... Shut up! That's impossible! l won't lose even if l die. you came here after dying. The Earth should, defeat yama's World. What is he doing? How can he sit and bat? That's the style of our Lord. Last time he batted while crawling. Wow! That is yamaganda! Catch the ball! That's cheating! That's the style of our Lord. He is like a bull in form and his bat is flexible. l condemn this rubbish game. A bat should be like a bat. - Okay - Ball, please. Thank you. Stop! Why should l get up forthis? l'll sit and bat. l got it. l got it. Wickets! Come to me. Run! Run! Run! Run! What is this nonsense? l won't catch the ball! Oh God! Sachin Tendulkar can't make so many runs... ...even if he plays throughout his life. Chittu! The poor man is discouraged. l'll declare the innings. What? He talks as if he played a gentleman's game. What bowling do you want? Fast or spin? He can't run fast with his body. l want fast. How can you bowl sitting on the buffalo? That's the style of our Lord. l can't handle that much speed. Then l'll throw a spin That's better. Why is he coming in a palanquin like a bride? Why is the ball jumping this side and that side? Oh God! ou are finished! Lord! Lord! es? lt's time to punish the sinners. Even this crown feels heavy because of that human. Why worry about it? Keep the crown at home... Chitragupta! our weird behavior shoWS that you are scared of him. No! l'm jjust being careful. They both mean the same. lf you think about him and stay back... ...the queue of sinners will stretch to the other worlds. l should make sure that the human... ...doesn't come here in my absence. Son yamaganda! Greetings, father! May you life forever! Son, l want to give you a responsibility. Give it to me, father. He is stretching his hands thinking that... ...responsibility is some kind of eatable, Lord. - ls it not? - No! Don't worry, father. Leave your worries with me. lf he comes anywhere nearthis house... ...l'll squeeze him with my hands... ...and stamp him under my legs and finish him off. Will you eat him as well? That's my style l'll eat anything to do my duty. yamaganda, don't eat anything you see. Father, what is this? Non-vegetarian food? No, it's a fruit from earth. Afruit? -you should peel the skin before eating it. - Okay. And you should throw this part. Okay. - Son! -yes? Be careful of the human. l'll take care of him father Please go. What is it, Lord? ls the crown irritating you again? lt's not enough to give this responsibility to yamaganda. We should know whether he is doing it well or not. We'll know it when that human comes. l'll go to yamaganda in that human's form to test him. This fruit doesn't taste so bad. Hey! Where are you going, human? l know you very well. Don't play your tricks with yamaganda. Do you think l'm, a fool like my father... ...that you can deceive, me and go inside? l'm afraid of yourfather, not you. Do you know something? My father is scared of me. l'm warning you to turn back. Otherwise l'll use my weapon, and bury you in the wall. No, l'll go back. ou should be afraid of me. Oh God! Father! Please forgive me, father. l threwthat peel as l didn't know it was you. He has broken bones. Hey! Son, l'm proud of you. Why? Because you had a fall? No, l'm proud of the way he handled his responsibility. l'm very proud to be his father. Now l can fulfill my duties with courage. Chitragupta, come. Father, you are a clever man. But l know how to deal with you. Wait! Son, didn't you recognize me? Of course l recognized you, father. Why did you come back so early? Did you finish the meeting? No, my heart is broken. Did you come to test me again? l have faith in you. l came here because l doubt your mother and sister. Father! ou fool! l didn't mean that doubt Slap yourself. l came in that human's form to test... ...whetherthey are as strong as you. Please go ahead. Thanks, brother. Wait! What did you say? l'm in that human's form now. That's right Please go inside. Wait! The peel. l want your sister. Why did he say that? Narayana! What is it, troublemaker? Narada, why are you here? l came here to give you some important information. l won't listen to you. our wish No one can save yourfamily. Wait a minute. What's the matter? Tell me. l won't tell you l'm not in the mood now. Please tell me, Narada. l will tell you because l still respect you. That human is making your fears come true. Husband! Son, that musical instrument is very good. l've heard a variety of flutes and trumpets before. But l've never seen this one. lt's a mouth organ, mother. lt's a musical instrument that has... ...romantic heroism on our earth. Heroes like us impress heroines like you with this. Teach me how to play that organ. - Me too. - Okay. l'll teach you both at the same time. Lord, he is playing with you and them as well. He is your son-in-law after all. Oh my aunt! Daughter of aunt!

Notjjust you even l can't forget it. Madam danced so well. Chitragupta! yes, Lord? Give me that drink My head is hot with anger. That drink won't work if your head is hot with anger. So, l got this. What is that? lmported scotch whisky from earth. We can forget our worries if we drink this. We can even trouble the people that depend on us. Even you have a drink. How can l drink before you? Respect me before others not before a drink. Go ahead. ou are kind. l have devotion foryou. l have respect foryou. l have hatred for you. Hey! -yama! -yama? ou forgot me, the man beside you... ...and gave a human the chance to defeat you. Pathetic man! Do you know whom you are talking to? Shut up! What is so great about you? He is drunk. A genius like me should get your drinks in secret? Should l get you the woman you desire? lf l sit on that throne l won't have figures to punish you. Where is the drink? Did you finish it? The drink is finished. Did l ever answeryour questions in that manner? l poured you another drink. Come on. Oh God! l unnecessarily messed with that fat fellow. lf l get caught he'll show me hell in his own style. lt's better to hide here No one can find me here. Tell me what you did for me. Because you ill-treated me a human called Naresh... ...came from earth to deal with you and yourfamily. He doesn't know that he has no destiny yet. lf he finds out that he has the same powers as you... ...you'll be completely ruined. ou and yourfamily will have to bearthe consequences. -What? l have the powers of Gods? -es. Anything l say will be fulfilled? l'm trying to fool, my father-in-law... ...and you are trying to fool me in turn. just use your logic and think about it. Even though you are messing with Lord yama... ...he's not able to do anything What's the reason? Think deeper. How could you come here before dying? Because of my love. That happens only in the movies This is real life. ou can test it to confirm it. Command me to go back to earth See if l go. Go back to earth. Notjjust your mouth even my brain has power. Silk, it's been so long since l saw you last. Adorn your hair with jasmines and be ready for me. Come up. Why am l going up again? Why did l come here again? Naughty boy! Can't l bring you up if l can send you down? That's correct. Since you gave me such great news... ...you have to see my next step. Another step? Father, wait and watch how l'll trouble you.

Lord, tomorrow you'll have the powers... ...to put an end to that human's drama. So, please calm down today. Get your powers tomorrow. Will you move aside? Why? Will you clean the throne with that cloth? l put that there so that l can sit on that throne. - Hey, l'm yama! - This is a kerchief. Whoever puts that in the seat first should take that seat. ou can ask our transport system about its capacity. This is not your government's transport system. This is the authority of my government. Today is an off foryour authority. Because the seat and the authority belong to me. Lord, tomorrow you'll have the powers... ...to put an end to that human's drama. So, please calm down today. Get your powers tomorrow. Gupta! Did you call me, Lord? How do l look in this getup? you look like Lord yama on a diet. Gupta! Shut up and sit down.

He put his head on the railway tracks. What's the matter, brother? My girlfriend's dad is getting her married... ...to someone else tomorrow. So you died today and came here? lsn't eloping better than death? Look, brother! ou died jjust once. But that girl will die every day in an unwanted marriage. Go! Slap your father-in-law if he stops you. Okay? lt's not enough to have a heart to love. ou need to have the courage to win your love. - Chitragupta! -yes, Lord? Send him down immediately. - That's not possible -Why not? - Rules of the book - Throw it in the bin. you can go. Next. A drunk driver killed these school children with a truck. yama! you are too much! lf you had killed that drunk driver 5 minutes earlier... ...these kids would've been happily playing with parents. Don't you care about their pain? Don't you have mercy or common sense? Human, life and death are decided by Creator. That's enough. He writes whatever comes to his mind. And you guys go and take their lives. Why can't you give equal lifespan to everyone? Creator decides their lifespan based on... ...their acts in their previous lives. Their previous lives? ou destine that they should do those mistakes. And you kill them for doing those mistakes. ou are playing cricket with our souls. This is what you do, right? Do you think nobody will question you? l'm giving you the answer. And that is, l'll give l'll dojjustice to my people. l'm yama! Human, what do you know about destinies? ln the first birth, everyone is destined to a full lifespan... ...with complete knowledge But humans selfishly use that knowledge... ...to destroy the society and commit sins. Those sins become curses for the next life... ...and they get punished in hell for committing them. ou said it is wrong to take the lives of children. The sins of their parents in their previous lives... ...are responsible for the deaths of these children. ou know nothing about these things... ...because you are a mere human. just because you have equal powers with Gods... ...you became arrogant and played games with me. But today l'm more powerful than you. Even with all this power l can't harm you. ou have no death as you have no destiny. But yourfather and brother have destinies. See what will happen to your family in the next 3 days. See this as well. Did you see their destinies? They will meet their deaths in the next 3 days. Lord yama! Please don't do that l beg of you. Fool! lt's my duty to fulfill destinies. ou cannot stop death jjust as you cannot stop time. Please don't say that. Only you have the authority to stop death. My only mistake was to fall in love with your daughter. l'll kill my love for your daughter right before you. But please don't harm my family. ou can take my life if you want. As long as you have those powers... ...no one has the authority to take your life. l don't want any powers, Lord yama Take them away. My father and brother are the pillars of my family. Please don't be unjjust to my family by taking their lives. l can only fulfill the destinies that are written. l don't have the authority to change them. l will save my family Give me one chance, Lord yama. ou have no powers now. ou can't do anything even if you go back to earth. lt's impossible to save them. No, Lord! Since l know what is going to happen... ...l'll save them by not letting them go there. Give me 3 days time Afterthat you can take my life. Okay, l'll accept your request. Go. Son... What's wrong? Why are you so worried? Son... Please forgive me This is your world. l came to a place where no human can come. But l'm still a human l can never be equal to you. That's why l'm leaving this place forever. Can you please call yamaja? My mom believes that f we see yamaja's face... ...before going anywhere everything will be a success. l should succeed My mom's belief should come true. l'll come with you. ou can't come. ou married me. l'm your wife. No! How can l get married when l have no destiny? What do you mean? Will you leave my hand? My family is in your hands, yamaja. l've to leave their hands to hold your hand. Should l leave them? our hands tied a bundle at the Goddess' temple... ...wishing for their welfare. Can you wish badly forthem? Since you got a taste of their affection... ...you left my hand to save them from harm. l'm their son. What can l leave? That's why l left my life. Naresh! Listen! Our son is here. Our son is here? Where have you been all these days? Actually... Why are you asking him that question? He mjust've gone to another town for his dramas. yes, dad. l finished the drama. Didn't it occur to you that we'll worried about you? He'll inform us only when he has concern for us. you were missing from home for 10 days. l wonder whether you ate well or not. Make his favorite dishes for him. our exams are approaching. lf you don't pass this time you'll not get another chance. The syllabus will change next year. yes, dad. The syllabus will change. This is my last examination. Whatever is destined will take place. By the way where is the servant girl? She didn't come back from the temple that day. She won't come back, mom Her father took her with him. Brother! Hey, where were you all these days? Forget that. Why are you worried? No, l'm fine. No, brother. Something is wrong. No. l was a bit worried about you in your absence. Brother, where are you wife and kids? She went to see her parents She'll come in 2 days. The shirt. Light blue shirt. l can't find my scooter keys Where did you keep them? Where did you keep them? Why can't l find them? l kept them right here but l can't find them now. Why did you come running? Nothing, dad. ou said you can't find the scooter keys. yes, l can't find them. l'm getting late for school. Mom, you search there. Okay, l'm getting late l'll take the bus. Goodbye, son. Dad! ou should say, l'll see you later. - Okay, l'll see you later. -yes. Dad! Oh God! Dad! Look at me. Father! What's wrong? -What? ls he yourfather? -yes. Why did you commit suicide from my bus? Suicide? yes, he jumped out of the bus. Dad... Why did you do that foolish thing, dad? Why did you try to commit suicide? Why did you do that, dad? Because l'm a father. Every father desires to see their sons become capable. Even l had that desire. But... God didn't give me that chance. ou are roaming around without any responsibilities. One of my eyes was blinded long back. But l didn't worry about it. Do you know why? l was happy to see the world with one eye. That one eye is my older son. l can't bear it if something happens to that eye. What are you talking about, dad? Hey! What are you doing? Leave me, dad. Get down. l won't life, l'll die. First get down. lf something happens to you... How can we live if something happens to you? What is this foolishness? Why are you doing this? Look what happened. How can you deceive the bank? Royyala Naidu hates me for sending him to prison. The ones who applauded me for my honesty in the bank... ...joined hands with Naidu and forged some documents... ...to show a deficit of, 2.5 million rupees in the bank. They created strong proof that l did that crime. l can't prove my innocence, dad. There are only two ways. l have to pay back that money or go to prison. l can't do any of them. So... What brother did was wrong. But did you do the right thing, dad? l know that it's not the right thing. But l'll have to die so that he gets the insurance money. l sold our house but it didn't fetch 2.5 million rupees. We need another 300,000. Who will lend money if we can't pay them back? Don't worry, dad l'll arrange that money. l arrange the food you eat. ou have the power to make others laugh. But you don't have the power to earn money. l will really earn that money. l will do it, dad. Please trjust me. Who else will trjust me if you don't? Please, dad! Trjust me. What should we do? l don't know. But we should somehow earn that money. just say yes, l'll get the tools ready. For what? We'll rob the very bank that is creating problems for brother. We'll settle this whole matter in a single night. What do you say? lf everyone that needs money steals it... ...only thieves will remain on this earth. But... Hi, Naresh! How are you, man? l've been trying to contact you since last week. ou are... l'm Narendra, an event organizer. l transform stage shoWS into albums and release them. l saw your performance last time lt was simply superb. Look, brother! l need an ultimate program... ...which is message oriented and which touches the heart. Will you do it for me? Don't worry about the money. l will pay you whatever you want in advance. Say yes. l'll do it, sir. l'm a joker, not a lover. This is my heart. Let it be magic or illusion lt takes us to an unknown world Yesterday is a waste paper Today is a news paper Tomorrow is an question paper Life is a book, fail to read it properly Can't find answers for the troubles you face And don't get confused yourself l am the laughter joker! Friend! Both our roles are different We're born with pre-written destiny This is purely the drama of life Hardly we born and open our eyes Then began our life story We should lead it forward The director who makes us act The audience who praise our performance ls none other than God Himself He hides from our eyes But watches our antics And assesses our good and bad deeds Good performance makes you a good scorer Get scared and fail and you become a joker Good performance makes you a good scorer Get scared and fail and you become a joker l feel l'm seeing light after ages. But my body is burning hot. Sir, there's air conditioning in the car. Please get inside. Air conditioning won't solve the problem. That officer's death will cool me down. ou have the power to make others laugh. But you don't have the power to earn money. Before you close and open your eyes The time will pass in a jiffy lt is His play He decides the start and the end Should perform the characters given to us Should fulfill our duties as written in our fate Parents gave life to this body l am duty bound to repay them Should make them happy those who gave birth Good performance makes you a good scorer Fail in your duties and you become a joker Do your duties perfectly Don't be called as a joker l accept you as my wife before the five elements. Nothing you desire can be attained easily No road to happiness is straight Destiny can be altered by parting from the love one Will have to bear the pain of the heart Curse and remorse are the only two ways out The life mjust go on whatsoever... The play should be ended without fully getting defeated Perform the play to His likes You'll be a good player lf you perform otherwise You'll become a joker Perform the play to His likes You'll be a good player lf you perform otherwise You'll become a joker Fantastic! Brother! l paid back all the money. - Brother! - The problem is solved. Okay. But why did you wear this shirt? - What's wrong with it? -ou didn't have this shirt. our sister-in-law brought it for me while coming back. But why are you so worried? No, brother Take off that shirt right now. Officer! Brother, take off this shirt. -What are you doing? -just take off this shirt. l didn't decide that l'll kill him if he has a shirt. l jjust decided that l'll kill him That's it. Brother! Oh God! Oh God! ou can't escape from me. l beg of you. Don't kill me. Royyala Naidu set the trap. Brother, take off this shirt Come on. Brother, please take it off. Take it off, come on quick. Take it off, brother. 'ou fooled me by showing only half truth, Lord yama.' Royyala Naidu! ou are finished! Son! Son! Mom! Brother! 'ou gave me a chance to save my family.' 'Thanks, yama.' Son! Son! l'm the guardian of this invisible wheel of time. l decide the lifespan of everyone in this universe. l give death and take lives. There is no power that can stand against me. How can a mere human stand against me? l made you write your own destiny. l made you spell your own death. And then l took your life. l'm Lord yama! What did you say? Will you make me wash your feet? you died today and fell at my feet. Narada! ou created all this drama didn't you? Look how l put an end to it today. Tell your creator to do his duties sincerely from now. Are you proud of yourself? you've proved that you are impartial... ...by punishing humans on earth and you daughter too. you can be proud of yourself. -Aiyo! -yes, l'm Aiyo. l'm your wife Aiyo that never spoke against you. But l question you today as a mother of a daughter. Answer me. What sin did this human do? ls it a sin not to misuse his powers? Or, is it a sin to be born without a destiny? Don't you know that it was Brahma's mistake... ...that he didn't write this man's destiny? Then how can you punish him forthat? ls it because humans are below yourfeet? Or, is it because there is no one above to punish you? The problem started the day this human was born. Why didn't you take that into account that day itself? Are you punishing him today because he loves your girl? our whip that takes lives is not great. Their love that gives life is great. That's why he gave his life to save his father's life. He sacrificed his love for your daughter. He left his powers at your feet and left. you should be proud that your daughter... ...got a place in such a loving man's heart. Father, killing is your duty. So you killed him. you killed our love. Kill me as well, father. l don't ask for anything else as your daughter. Lord, we are used to giving lovers an untimely death. lt doesn't matter if he is a man oryour own daughter. yes, father. Shejjust asked you for one thing. At least fulfill this one desire of hers. l love my sister very much Me as well... Husband, look into my eyes. Why can't you look into my eyes? ls it because you did a mistake? Be it a human or a God they can't look into the eyes... ...of another person when they do a mistake. l know that you are stopping your heart. Otherwise why would you have tears in your eyes? you can deceive your heart. But your eyes give you away. There's nothing like that. Dust went into my eyes and made them teary. Hey, Human! you what's the most powerful weapon in the world? lt is love. you proved that you can win over your neighbor... ...the neighboring country and even Lord yama with it. Don't stand before me Take my daughter and leave. ou? Why did you come after doing what you did? l came to do what needs to be done. -What is left to be done? -Wedding. There are no auspicious timings in this month. Shut up! Brahma himself wants to get them married. Why do you need auspicious timing? The time fixed by Brahma is very auspicious. What, Brahma? Brahma! What time did you fix forthat? - For what? - l meant for that. We don't need him forthat We'll fix it ourselves. Let's go. That's the story of yama's son-in-law. He finished his intermediate exams... ...and immediately went for his honeymoon. But he got his honeymoon results... ...before the intermediate results. yeah! l think yourfather called him up. l told you. - My father. -yes, dad! you passed your exams. Really? -our daughter-in-law is missing. -What? l meant she is pregnant. -Am l going to be a grandfather? -yes. yeah! Tell this to your father-in-law as well. l told you since you have a phone. How should l tell him? yami! That man is going to yourfather. Let's tell him. Hello, brother! Please do me a favor. Tell her father that she is pregnant. What? Oh, sorry. you speak English, right? you tell Lord yama that his daughter is pregnant. Ask him to celebrate this Enjoyment, okay? Okay. He'll give the message.
