I live on peanut butter sandwiches, So my sweat smells like peanut butter Instead of B.O., which is fine. I'd rather smell like a school cafeteria than a school gym. In two weeks, I turn 13, Which is kind of a big deal if you've ever been 12. I'm pretty sure there's a secret handshaking You learn when you're a teen like a seal of approval Or a sign that says, "congrats, you're in the club, Even if you smell like peanut butter. " Knock yourself out, kid. Everyone should have a collection. That's what my dad always said. My dad collected used furniture and was always on the hunt For a 13-cent stamp issued in Hawaii in 1913. There is only 13 in existence so, you know, Jackpot if you find one. Even my best friend Lizzy has a collection. Yes, my best friend's a girl, And, no, I don't have a crush on her. Ru-u-u-u-n! And when I say Lizzy collects, I mean she steals. I'm pretty sure one day she'll get us arrested, But for now she only takes stuff that no one would miss, Stuff like playing cards and banana stickers. Well, well, ahoy there, Summer vacationers. Dad, you're embarrassing me. Really? Because when I said it yesterday, You thought it was very funny You did. Alright, fine. Well, I have your... my magazine. Right, thank you. You're reading "teen fashion"? And I have a package for you, master fink. Oh... Ah, wait a minute. Now it says it's for your birthday, But it's addressed to your mom, and it's registered mail, So that means it has to be signed by... An adult. Correct. So I'm sorry. Well, my mom's at work all day, You know that, And I don't think she would mind if I signed it. well, you are as tall as some adults, And you're almost 13. Dad? You're being a pain. okay. Fine then. Sign right there. The pen's in there. And, you young lady, I expect your chores to be done By the time I finish my route. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. All right, now make like bananas and split. Yes. Wait, Lizzy, we have to pack this up neatly So my mom doesn't know we opened it. What the heck? Lizzy, look at the date. That's the day your dad died. I can't believe it's been five years. Oh! Ahem, "scientists believe black holes Might be the key to time travel. " You need to put this in your file. I already have it in my file. I clipped it on the week of his funeral. Wait, there's a letter. "from the law offices of Liam Goffanine Esquire. "dear Elaine, I know I wasn't supposed to send this "until Jeremy's birthday, "but we're shutting down our Manhattan branch. "when you sent this to me five years ago, "I took great care to hide the keys somewhere very clever, "so clever that now I can't find them. I'm certain you and Jeremy will figure out a new way to... " Stop. "way to open it, and when the time comes"... Wait! Wait. "I have nothing but fond memories of Daniel And I was honored to treasure this for Jeremy, "for all these years. Best wishes to you both, Liam Goffanine. " "the meaning of life, for Jeremy fink To open on his 13th birthday. " I gotta go. But... Tampering with mail is a federal offense! I'm too young to go to on prison! Hi, Elaine! Bye, Elaine! Oh, monkey. Hey, you wanna know something? Your dad would have opened it, too. He was very curious about everything. That's why he loved flea markets and collecting so much. You know, he always used to come home And find all these special things, And even if they were broken, we would... We would figure out a way to give them a new life, you know? Like that flower pot over there? It had a crack in it, so... Umbrella stand. Right. And see? You know, our dear old grandfather clock over there. Sure, it's broken, but it's still right twice a day. Look at things a different way, and the answers will come, Like in "through the looking glass," remember? I stopped at "Alice in wonderland. " blasphemy, monkey, and your mother a librarian! That's why it's at the top of our Summer reading list, honey, Because it teaches you to look at things From a different perspective. Your father was so good at that. He taught me how to think that way, And it made life so much sweeter. Like he always said, "eat dessert first," And, boy, did we eat dessert first. I remember dad saying that. You know what? I remember the very day that he found this, alright? Now, most people might see this as just a box To put on a coffee table and admire. No, your father knew that it was the most unique object He had ever seen, somewhere to put the most important thing In the world, the secret of life. So what's in it? I don't know. It's a secret. He was very secretive about it. He wants you to find out. Wanted me to find out. Right. Wait, so he did this because he knew he was going to die? No, monkey, we all die. It's because he loves you. Yeah, but he knew he was going to die. That fortune teller told him on his... On his 13th birthday, yes, I know, But that does not mean it was true. But it happened. She said he was going to die when he was 40, and it happened. Please, can... can we... let's not. Let's just not. Let's... let's put our heads together and find a way To figure out where those keys are. They're lost. That's what the letter said. Ah, lost. That can mean so many things. Like? Like they're just waiting to be found. At night, when the city gets quiet, I like to take my H.O.J., hour of Jeremy. I usually spend it reading about time travel Or researching scientific facts. When I was young, after my dad died, H.O.J.S were for building my time machine And thinking about the what-ifs, Like the day my dad died. What if... stop. What if that morning my dad left for work, He stopped to give me a kiss while I was sleeping? Or what if he had taken Delancey instead of Broome? He took a different route to work every day. What if he had called in sick? And what about that woman? What if she had left the coffee shop 10 measly seconds later Because the owner wanted to talk about the weather? What if her coffee had been the perfect temperature? Maybe she would have sat in her car a moment longer And enjoyed the first sips? Just one moment. It would make all the difference. "sorry I bailed. Hope you're not grounded. Come over tomorrow. I have a plan. Enjoy the jelly beans. Lizzy. " Hey, looks like we got some new neighbors. Who cares? Get in here. From easiest to most difficult. Plan "a"... freezer! Plan "b"... butter knife! Ooh, I'm sorry. Plan "c"... nuke it. I don't think we should nuke it. Strike plan "c"! Plan "d"... Larry's locks and clocks. Good idea. And if that doesn't work, plan "e"... We go to the flea market and find some keys. I've never seen keys there. Well, you haven't been there in like five years. So you wouldn't even know. I used to go there all the time with my dad. I know. I was there, too. Duh. And there were keys. You're gonna have to leave the 2-block radius Of our building someday, Jeremy. Well, what's plan "f"? Maybe we can just skippy and go straight to "f". Let's hope you'll never have to know. I've never seen anything like it in all my years. Well, do you have any keys that might fit? You don't have the keys? Well, that's a darn shame. This here is no ordinary box. It has an internal locking mechanism with pins And... and tumblers. And each hole needs a different type of key, And unfortunately, there is a... An internal latch that prevents the box from being pried open. See here? There's a layer of metal under the wood. Now in order to get through that, You can't without destroying what's inside. Well, I guess plan "g" is out. There is a plan "g"? Chainsaw. That would not be a good idea. You don't wanna destroy the meaning of life, Now do you? Off to the flea market to find some keys. We just have to keep our eyes peeled. Nothing to fear, fink. Nothing at all. Am I talking to myself here? I'm not proud of the fact that I've never taken Public transportation without an adult, but... But what?! You live in new freaking York! I know, it's just that everything I need Is usually within my walking distance-ish. Well, not today! Whoa, Lizzy, wait! Look at all this stuff. Most of it doesn't even seem to have a purpose. Please, half the stuff in your house doesn't have a purpose. Word. Your dad used to say One man's trash is another man's treasure. Whenever he said that, you said, "one man's trash is another man's trash. " Did I say that? Wow. I must have been a pain when I was younger. Hey, Lizzy! Look. Eight of hearts. Isn't this one of the ones you were missing? Well, yeah, it is, thank you very much. But now you've ruined it. You know the rules. I have to find it, and I can't pay for it. It's okay to pay for things in a collection. Not in mine. Keys! You break it, you buy it. But how could we break keys? You kids have a way of breaking everything. Well, we have some locks, And we just wanna see if the keys fit... If you want to try it, you pay for it. But couldn't we just... no. Not even to just... not even to just. Ru-u-u-u-u-n! Run! Run! Breaking and entering, that's plan "f"? Well, the keys are somewhere in that lawyer's office. It says so in the letter. They could be under the carpet or in a drawer or something. Where's the flashlight? It's illegal. You'll get us arrested. Do you wanna spend the rest of your life Searching through an endless supply of keys Or do you wanna go to the source? The law office is all the way uptown. What if my mom doesn't want me going up there alone? Then what? I have to lie to her. And then what if she finds out that I lied? And what if the other people Have already moved into that office? Are you gonna sit there what-iffing all day When you can actually go out into the world And find the answers? Look, I've got a bus map, gloves, and a screwdriver. Now I just need the dumb flashlight and candy. The candy? To bribe the security guard. Duh. And what if that doesn't work? Then I'll have to use my feminine wiles. Your wha? Feminine wiles. You don't have those. Yeah, I do. You're just blind. You'll see tomorrow with the security guard If it comes to that. Yes! I will see you in the morning. And be sure to dress for success. I don't think I can go today. Is it bad? Define "bad. " Crud. How will my feminine wiles work now? Does your mom have any, like, zit makeup? How would I know? Can I check? Sure. Or we can just cancel plan "f"? Oh, hi. Hi! I'm Samantha. I'm Rick. I'm Lizzy. I'm a delinquent. We just moved into the building. Oh, cool. Just so you know, we've got a meeting On the upper west side with lawyers. We don't normally dress like this Or carry briefcases. Say nothing, please. Elaine? Hey, blueberry. Can I borrow some makeup? Sure. Right under the sink. Sweet. Have a fun day. Alright, well, I have made a whole pile Of peanut butter sandwiches, And they are in the fridge just waiting to be eaten. Okay. Got it. Also, if you're planning to go out, Just make sure you bring a set of keys with you. I'm staying in. I'm not going out. Oh? Really? Oh, oh, oh! Almost forgot. Look. Look what one of the publishers Brought to the library the other day. It's the new planet you've been talking about, The one with the blue ice and the curly clouds. Looks like Neptune. Really? Huh. Not if you look at it like this. See? Yeah. I guess so, sort of. Monkey, remember in "the little prince" When the little prince wanted the man to draw him a sheep, But the man wasn't very good at drawing sheep, So he Drew him a box, and both of them knew That the sheep was inside the box. It's what we believe that's important. Still looks pretty neptunish. Isn't it late? Shouldn't you go? Oh, my goodness. You are right. Alright, well... A voil! okay. Be good. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Bye, monkey. Bye, blueberry! Bye! Thanks for the makeup! Lizzy? No more what-ifs. Get on the bus. Please make him stop. Who? Garlic sandwich. Garlic man. Definitely garlic! Jeremy, the rest of the world Doesn't live on peanut butter sandwiches, you know. Yeah, I know. This is unbearable. It's exactly why I do not do public transportation. Garlic? Garlic. People. Irritating people. It's too much information. Oh! What? I just looked in someone's ear. I do not want to know this much information About people I do not know. Please get me out of here. This is our stop. Hey! Wait! That was our stop! Mister, that was our stop! Mister! You have to press the yellow bar. What? He said we had to push the yellow bar. I can't go on. People... Pick up your bag or somebody's gonna steal it. You pick it up. Great. We're lost. It'll take us forever to get back To where we were supposed to be, And we'll have to find another bus. Then we won't have exact change... Shut up! You're being overdramatic. It's just two blocks. Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh! What? That! I haven't found a card in two years. One down, one to go, and my collection is complete! But if we had gotten off at our stop, There's no way in the world we would have found this. How many other eight of hearts are wedged in sewer grates, Waiting for people to miss their stop Or take a wrong turn? And is it a wrong turn if something so right happens? What if you can map out all the possibilities And go back in time to try them? Would the number of possibilities Be infinite or finite? And why is someone shaking me? Earth to Jeremy. Earth to Jeremy. Hello? Oh, was I saying that out loud? You were having a what-if fest of epic proportions. Lizzy, because we missed our stop, You found one of the two playing cards You're missing for your collection. I know. It's awesome. It's beyond awesome. It's jaw-droppingly awesome. Now, come on, let's go. We got keys to find. Pick that up. Try to look like you belong. It's a good thing you don't have to scale up the building And break in with a glass cutter. That was part of plan "f" I didn't tell you about. Really. Excuse me. Where do you think you're going? Um, well... Our uncle works on the 14th floor? All visitors must sign in. write Tony castaway. T- o-n-y c-a-s-t-a... Yeah, you're good. Thank you. Jack here. run! Why were you vandalizing the office? Well, we had passes to go up there. So this is all just a big misunderstanding. We have it all on video. You destroyed private property. Add breaking and entering, And you're working on a pretty serious rap sheet. There was no breaking, and the door was unlocked. So what's so bad about entering? Stop it. Stop talking. I asked you not to get me arrested this Summer. We're not getting arrested. Are we? Names? And none of Tony and Tia crap. Jeremy fink and Elizabeth Muldoun, M- u-I-d-o-u-n, and we did everything you said, The breaking, the entering, the false identification. My dad died, and we needed some keys, And I knew that plan "f" would get the book thrown at us. Just take us to juvenile hall. I waive my rights to a lawyer. Let's see what kind of community service We can find here. You mean we're not going to juvie? Not unless there is something more you'd like to confess to. That was it. Really? You sure? In order to pay back society for your vandalism, Breaking and entering, and false I.D., You get to pick up trash in central park, Or you can work with the NYPD mounted unit stables. With horses? With horse manure. How are shoveling skills? Weak. At best. Well, there's another option. You two look like you qualify as first-time offenders. Helping a man named Mr. Oswald make deliveries. The job does involve some heavy lifting, And you two look like you've never seen the inside of a gym. We'll take it. We have muscles. Keep a log of your hours in these and your observations. Observations of what? Stuff. Community service is supposed to make you learn something, Come away a better person, yadda, yadda, yadda. Give me your addresses, and Mr. Oswald Will send his driver over to pick you up. Wait, if this guy has a driver, Then why doesn't he just hire people to help him? You know, you got a real fresh mouth on you, kid. I'm about this close to giving you the trash detail And your buddy here, the delivery kick, got it? Yes, sir. That's right... yes, sir. Now what do you say we give your parents A little ring-a-ding-ding here? Did you get grounded? No. I did. Good. You deserve it. You ruined my Summer. Lucky I'm still friends with you after what you did. I have a permanent record now, And I'll never get into a good college, so super lucky. You ratted us out! I told the truth! You caved like a baby! I have my integrity! Jeremy fink and Elizabeth Muldoun? yes? Wait, wait, why is a limo picking you up, dork? Rich uncle. Wow. Yeah, pretty much. Like, he's a very powerful man who doesn't take too kindly To his nephew being called a dork. Rich uncle, huh? yeah. Sweet. Man, oh, man, if I had known Community service was this good, I would have gotten into some serious trouble years ago. So are you two siblings? Best friends? Girlfriend-boyfriend? Not girlfriend-boyfriend. Sometimes not even friends. Yeah, in the eyes of the law, we're like accomplices. But in real life, we're like half-orphans. You see, my mom's gone, and so is his dad, And we've lived next door since we were babies. It's nice you have each other. My mom died when I was 10. I know how you feel. My mom didn't actually die. She left, which is kind of worse in some ways. How can you say that's worse? At least you could see her again if you wanted. You know what? If you're gonna be a jerk all day, How about you just not talk to me? Fine. Fine. Right. Right. No talking. No talking. Mind the boxes. Go ahead. Ahead. Go, go. Up the stairs. Come on. Right here. Step. Hold the railing, please. Hold the railing. Hold the railing. Ah! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Come in! Come in! Come in! Please! Come in! My little truants. please, please, come in. Now, you must be master Jeremy and you must be miss... Don't tell me. Miss sissy, yes? Lizzy. Lizzy. Oswald, pleasure. you have a lot of amazing stuff. That doll is kind of cool-ish. Your house is like, wow. Ah, yes. I'll be sorry to leave it. But the warm climates of key largo, They... they... they agree better with these old bones. Except when it's humid or it rains, whoo! Now, uh, down to business. Ah, yes, community service. Now I need you to make some deliveries for me. Do you have a license to drive? Do you own a car? Are you married? No. Married? Unh-unh. Do you... do you like books? Do you like the smell of them? Do either of you even enjoy reading? Jeremy does, all the time, even during Summer break. His mom is a librarian, so it's massively genetic. I see. Well, I might have a book for you, Jeremy. Um, and what do you like to read, Jeremy? Uh, mostly science fiction, especially about time travel. Well, then, you might not appreciate this book. It's about animals in the... in the woods. I like science fiction, too. Have you ever read Eckhart Tolle? "the power of now"? Okay, now. Good luck. Enjoy. Wait, why would we need luck? Mary? This way. Follow me. Follow me. W- why do we need luck?! You won't need your backpack. But I have something very important inside. You brought it with you? Your computer will be safe in the car. 5b. Get on, little doggies. Seriously, you're not coming with us? I don't owe a debt to society. Oh, please, it was just a big misunderstanding. This is bullpuck. Yeah. And why did Oswald wrap it? Maybe it's not a book. Maybe it's a hollow book with a treasure inside Like the Hawaiian 13-cent stamp Or some keys. Ding-dong. Reality calling. Whatever it is, it's probably illegal. That's why he has minors deliver it. Children. Um, we have a delivery? And I suppose you'll be wanting a tip? Sure. No. Well, I'm not tipping anyone until I see who it's from. Oswald. Oswald who? We don't know his last name. Wait, maybe that is his last name. Or could be a fake name. you children are useless. Oh... Do something. Uh, ma'am? Call 911. Get off of me. Are you okay, ma'am? Do you need anything? A glass of water? 'cause if you are okay, then we'll be going. Where did you get that book? Whoa. Uh, the... the Oswald guy. He said it belonged to you. That is not possible. Oswald Oswald has been dead for years! Honestly, ma'am, we don't know anything. It spoiled my life. Let's get the heck out of dodge. Wait, ma'am, uh, what else happened? Go on. I was 16. I had a crush on a boy. And I knew he was going to a party, And I wanted to go, But I knew I'd have to get a fancy dress to wear. I sold the book... To... To... I knew it, Jeremy. Oswald set us up. To buy a fancy dress to go to the party. Get the book. Now... Open it. Winnie the pooh? The inside cover. "to Mabel and Bitsy. " It's signed by the author? Bitsy was my best friend. And if she wants more apologies, She can come here and ask me for them, Now get out. And leave the book! That's my pooh! We almost died today. Death by letter opener. Well, it's kind of sad when you think about it. She dumped her best friend for a guy. I thought it was a dress. Well, she needed her dress to get the guy, But who does that to their best friend? Oh! Hey, Rick! Um, how's it going? Good! Thanks for asking. Yeah, so maybe I can get a ride in that limo sometime? Oh, yeah, sure. Maybe. I'll see. Alright. Cool. See you later. Okay. I got to... Oh. Oh. Thanks. He's nice. Observation one... There are two types of choices, Choices that seem harmless but can wind up Leading to someone's father dying, Like buying a cup of coffee at a certain moment, And the other kind, when you know the choice Will lead to bad or good. Observation two. Like that woman today. She knew she was risking her best friendship With bitsy for a dress. Observation three... some choices are forever. Observation four... Just because people aren't in our lives anymore Doesn't mean they stop thinking about us, And vice versa. Goodnight, dad, wherever you are. I'm eating dessert first when I can. You sure she's coming? I don't know. She said she needed a few extra minutes. Girls. What happened? Eyeliner accident. What's eyeliner? Makeup for your eyes? See? Doesn't it make my eyes look more dramatic? I guess so. Well, one of them. Well, Samantha taught me how, and Rick says it looks better. They both think I should wear my hair down more often, too. When did they say this? Last night. I went and hung out at their apartment. Really? Mmm-hmm. why didn't you tell us that she had no idea We were gonna be there. They had no idea. She had no idea they were coming! And why did you say that the book was about woodland animals? The book was about woodland animals... Why did it take her 60 years to get it back? 60 years... 60... Mary! And don't think chocolate milk can keep us quiet. Although it is delicious. You have my sincere apology For not giving you enough information So you could do your job. The story started with my beloved grandfather, Oswald Oswald II Come on, is this story for real? I swear! I swear on... I swear on... on... I... I... I swear... On this 1932 Starsky and hutch telescope! Now that could be yours if the price is right. It's very rare, very valuable, cast in gold, And my grandfather grew up with nothing. Nothing. So... When children came to him With something of value to pawn, Well, grandpa's heart went out to those little hearts. He purchased their objects. He had each one of those young persons write out The reason they needed to sell. with some research, I made it my own personal duty to return almost everything To those who are still alive. The car is ready, sir, as is your biplane. Thank you. Very good, James. Jeremy? Sissy? I'll leave you to your own devices with this hint. The woodland animal book came with a form, And this one... Does too. Good luck. Simon Rudolph, age 14. "I need money to buy a silver watch. "all my friends have nice watches, But my mother's too busy spending money on herself. " "she has 20 of these lamps, so she won't notice "one missing because she doesn't notice anything. "dad says I need to learn the value of money, but someday, "I'll be even richer than him, And I'll have 50 silver watches. " You better be coming with us, James. My job is to drive you. I had no idea child endangerment Was part of your job description. Again, I don't owe a debt to society. So you're gonna leave us with them? What? What's wrong with those guys? They're not gonna hurt you. You're not gonna hurt them, right? See? Nice lamp. Thanks. Namaste. Simon. Jeremy. Lamp. Rub-a-dub. Thank you. You don't want it? I have a lamp. Works great. So that means I can keep this one, right? Right. Score. Let's go. Wait. Where's the watch? Which one? The one that you bought when you pawned your mother's lamp. I gave it to a homeless man after I made my first million. You made a million dollars and you live like this? Oh, I made a million over and over. Then I gave it all away. Money... It's dirty. Then how do you eat? I didn't say I gave away everything, But I do believe that all life's problems Come from attachment. What do you mean? When I was young, I thought it was all about owning as much as possible, I collected and amassed, and I hoarded as much As I could, including money. I made tons of it, but all those things, And all that dirty, dirty cash... Blinded me. It made me miss the point of... Living life. So getting rid of things would you say Is the meaning of life? Jeremy, you're reaching. And this is our out. Let's go. We'll just leave a note. We'll write on the table with our fingers. He'll find it. Lizzy, this could our plan "h," alright? I don't know if we can open the box, okay? But it's possible that we can learn the meaning of life From other people, how does that sound? From this guy? Jeremy, he's cuckoo-berry. Look at this flower. What do you see? Big, purplish flowers. Look at this picture. What does it mean? I don't know. I guess it kind of brightens the room? It reminds me to treasure every moment Because they are fleeting. A minute later, and the Sky will be different. It reminds me of a beautiful day Back when I used to go outside. So, a real question... What do you think a photo means to a flower? huh? Exactly. So when you ask the meaning of life, There is no single answer That will apply to everyone or everything. We all bring our own perceptions And experiences to every situation. Oh, oh, my God, is that... is that a bug? So wait, so you're saying that the meaning of life Or a sunset is different for everyone? Yes. And if you ask the meaning of life, You have to ask first, why are we here? I would love to continue this conversation, But right now, I have to shower and call an exterminator. Rain check. Observation five... I'm starting to think I don't understand the grownups at all. Observation six... or they just don't understand me. Observation seven... probably the only person On the planet who ever understood me was my dad, And now I have no clue what he's trying to tell me at all. Hey. Hi. How was your day? Fine. Freakish. Fine. Well, I made you some black-eyed peas, Huck Finn's favorite. Jeremy... Sweetheart. Monkey, you're on an adventure. An adventure's supposed to be fun. What's the point of trying if he's not even here To see what I'm doing? He is here, baby. I feel him all the time. I feel him in the wind. I feel him in the sunshine on my face. I feel him in the starlight at night. Whether or not you believe that he is here And that he's watching you, everything you do is important. Your father may have lived each day as though It were his last, but that does not mean that we Didn't have dreams that would carry us far into our old age. For instance, one of them, we decided We were gonna take you one night into the desert And watch a meteorite shower. And then, when you were a little older, Maybe, like, a few years from now, We'll bring you to Paris, And we could all wave our baguettes madly on the sand As the flyboats went by. Vive la France! And then the simplest but maybe my favorite dream Is that I would give your babies... If you ever have any... A million kisses as I held them in my arms. Look, I know I may not get to all of them, But gosh darn it, I can't stop dreaming these dreams And trying to make them come true Just because daddy's not here physically with us. He wouldn't want that. Please... Don't tell me what dad wants or wanted. Okay, monkey, I'm sorry. And please do not call me that. I am not a little monkey anymore. Right. Right, Jeremy, I'm... I'm sorry. I'll respect that. Thank you. What the heck are you doing? It's noon. It's a Summer vacation. I get to sleep in. Don't you wanna find the keys? What's the point? Excuse me?! And what's that? Are you sleeping with your dad's box? So? Wow. Get up. I have plan "h". I don't care, I don't wanna do anything Until I know why I'm here. Well, I'm pretty sure you won't figure that out Lying in bed with a box all day. Besides, we're due at Samantha and Rick's soon. I don't wanna go over there. Yeah, you do. I told them about the box and the keys... You what?! I told them about the box and... Great... You're up. Come on, Jeremy. Samantha says if you wanna know where the keys are, You have to go to the source. You have to ask your dad. What are you talking about? We're having a sance. She's got Ouija board and everything. No. I'm done listening to you and your stupid ideas. You always get me in trouble. You're like a bad luck charm. come on, she's had it worked When she asked her dead grandma something. Jeremy, what do you have to lose? My integrity! What's that even mean?! Let us all hold hands and close our eyes. You are gathered here today to call upon the spirit o... What's your dad's name? Daniel fink. Daniel fink. Mr. Fink, if you can hear the sound of my voice, Please send us a sign. Thank you. We shall take that as a sign of your presence And your willingness to speak. Why does it smell like peanut butter? I don't know. Just keep going. Okay. Let us all put our first two fingers on the pointer. Oh, great spirit of Daniel fink, We call upon you to answer our plea. Where are the keys you left for Jeremy? My bad. Be serious, Rick. Jeremy, are you feeling anything? Yeah, I feel like an idiot. Quiet! You must concentrate. I have way better things to do. What's more important than contacting your dad? Building your stupid time machine? hold up, you're building a time machine. I cannot believe you just said that out loud! What? Is it a big secret? Everyone knows you've been building it for years! It's not like I've worked on it recently! time machine?! That's the dorkiest thing I've ever heard. Shut up, Rick! Wait! Jeremy, wait! Don't be mad! Come back here, Jeremy! Go back to your new friends! Jeremy! Jeremy, I'm sorry! I was only trying to help! Go away! You've done enough! I don't want you to tell anyone about me Or my dad ever again! Are... are you destroying the time machine? Stop! Jeremy, stop it right now! What do you care? You don't even believe in it anymore! Do you think you're the only one That has to struggle to get out of bed? Do you think people don't just wish They could go back in time and change things? Yeah, your dad died. But he loved you, you big dumb jerk! My mom didn't love me enough to stay! Did you ever think about that? So how we doing today? Is it safe to assume you two are now silent partners? We're not partners. Just silent. Jeremy's not talking 'cause he's having A "existential" crisis. Oh, big word. Big whoop. And he gets cranky when he leaves the boring two blocks Around his apartment. What's the problem, Jeremy? A lot of things that I don't want to get into. Like what? Like I don't know why I'm here. How's that make you feel? I don't know. Like I'm lost in outer space and there's no gravity And nothing to hold onto. Well, maybe today's assignment Will help bring you back to planet earth. "this telescope belonged to my grandfather. "looking through it was his favorite thing to do. "he left it to me when he died. "I need the money to buy a track uniform, "and my parents can't afford it. "I need to run track in order to get a scholarship "to get into M.I.T. "someday I want to be a scientist "and help answer some of the questions in the world. I'm almost certain my grandfather would understand. " The telescope belongs to Dr. Grady. He's an astrophysicist at the museum of natural history. I remember that place. We went there on a school trip. I fell asleep during the movie thingy. Yeah, you were snoring like an elephant. Chop-chop. Find the scientist's entrance, and you'll find the answers. Excuse me? Uh, excuse me? Do... do you know where the scientists' entrance is? That way. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Excuse me! Do you know where the scientists' entrance is? Thank you. James, why do you have to do this to us? Jeremy and Lizzy? Dr. Grady. Pleased to meet you. You'll have to forgive my impatience, But we scientists are a very curious bunch. Wait, how did you know it was us? Oh, that nice gentleman over there pointed you out. I see endangering children's no longer part of the job. I can't take the suspense another moment. Tell me! What do you have? Incredible. How in the world did you find it?! This guy named Oswald. Old Ozzy is still alive? Impossible! No, Oswald is his grandson. Oh, well... well, that's a relief. For a second, I thought he built a time machine. Do you know how? Jeremy's been trying for five years. I told you to stop telling people! What? He's a scientist. Maybe he could help. Well, between us, I do think it would be theoretically possible To go back in time. As to traveling to the future, Now that would be incredibly difficult. Huh? Well, maybe you would understand better if I show you. One way to travel to the past is to look at the stars. The light that comes from stars has traveled from very far away. Never thought of it as looking into the past. Yes, you're seeing light as it appeared 100 years ago, Not as it looks today. It might not even exist anymore. Wrapping my mind around that Just made me think of 20 more questions. Well, I thought it was a headache, But it might be questions. Oh, now you see why I love science! When I was young and I pawned the telescope, I thought I'd know all the answers by now. I didn't realize that for every answer I learn, Twenty more questions pop up in its place. Wait. No, it is a headache. Stop. Please, go on. So it's very important that we not destroy What makes us curious. We encourage it. We... we... we delight in it. We... we... we keep asking and wondering And trying to understand, but when we stop wondering, We stop asking questions, And then there's no point being here. There's no point? Someday when you two are old and married... We're not getting married. At least not to each other. Well, regardless. I hope you're still asking questions when you're my age. Questions are the key to everything. are you sure you don't wanna put it back together? Dr. Grady was talking like it's possible-ish? It's going to the trash. You helping or watching? I need to go to Coney island. Because... To go to where the star first gave its light All those years ago. Talk English. When my dad turned 13, That fortune teller told him his Destiny. I need to go to the place where it all started. Maybe there's a clue there or something. Okay. I'm game. I think this is something that I need to do on my own. You're out of your gourd. I'm coming with you. No, really. I mean it. You gotta respect the man. Is that you? Yes. Okay. Oh, no, you don't. There's nothing to worry about, fink, and if there is, I brought this, just in case. Hey, Jeremy. Stop. Why? Because people will think There's something wrong with you. there is something wrong with me, Jeremy fink! You should know that by now! Where you going?! Stop. Jeremy fink's sweat smells like peanut butter! Can I see that for a second? Bingo. Let's find the old lady. If she's still alive. Wait. I just wanna see if I feel anything. Okay. welcome to Madame Zaleski House of Palm. Who would like reading today? No... ch-ch-ch-ch. Don't tell me. I think you are here... With, um, burning question of young love. no. Shh. Wait, wait. Don't speak. Don't speak. You are here today with... Question about lost pet. Dog, cat? Turtle? You are siblings who were separated at birth. I apologize, I believe we have the wrong place. No! Nonsense! No one comes into Madame Zaleski House of Palm by mistake! Bigger forces have brought you here! Well, we came looking for the real Madame Zaleski. Real? Madame Zaleski? What makes you think I am not real? Touch. Real. Very real. Uh, well, for one thing, you're too young. Oh, meow. Madame Zaleski like you. You I give reading half price. You, you pay full. Look, is there another Madame Zaleski That was here around 30 years ago? Mmm. Yes. My great aunt. She taught me everything I know. A shame what they did to her. Kick her off boardwalk after all those years. And may we ask why? Why? For nothing! They say she tell everyone same thing. What did she tell them? They claim she told all the women That they would grow long fingernails and have good shoes And all men that they would not live to see 40th birthday. Ridiculous! If she did this... if she did this, is gift. Make people live life more full. This is blessing, no? What? She told this to everybody? Does that mean yes? Yes. listen, do you guys want a reading or what Because I got a nail appointment in 20 minutes and I have to go. that clears up a lot. Guess it wasn't his Destiny to die young. It was just an accident. Or a coincidence. Same thing. Is it? I don't know. I feel like I don't know anything right now. Well, even if we don't find the keys, At least we learned... Stuff. Yeah, I guess that's what my dad wanted. Hey, Lizzy? Yo. I'm sorry about the thing I said. Or I'm sorry for what I didn't say Is what I mean. I've been so busy missing my dad, I never stopped to think about how hard it must be For you when your mom left. I thought it was temporary and that she'd be back And everything would be okay. And then you'd have your mom again. I really never thought about How hard it must be for you. Thank you, Jeremy. And I'm sorry, too, About telling anyone about your dad Or the time machine. I was just trying to help. Sissy, wake up! Now, since today will sadly be our last day together... Thank you. What? In two days, I'll be sailing to the Florida keys. So as a reward for a job well done, I'd like you to choose something from my shelves, And if you wish... doll, please. Alright, help yourself. Yes! What? Jeremy, is there anything you'd like? Do you by Chance have any stamps? Stamps, uh... Stamps. I have stamps. Ha ha! I meant old stamps. Oh, what... what kind of stamps are you looking for? A 13-cent Hawaiian issued in 1913. It's pretty rare. I don't believe so. Um... Letter opener? Nah, I'm good. Then may I make a suggestion? Uh, sissy said that you aren't fond Of traveling outside the two blocks of your general area? I'm getting better. He is, as long as someone's with him. His palms don't sweat anymore. Well, that's commendable, 'cause turning 13 is a big deal, And there's a whole world out there Ready for you to conquer. That's why I suggest you take this. That could come in handy. Whoa! What's in it? Flotsam and jetsam, papers, photos, pencils, keys. I... Mary?! Will you dump this junk out of here?! No! I... I mean no, thank you, Flotsam and jetsam. It's great. I love it. Skip it. Very well. It has been a great pleasure meeting the both of you. Goodbye. Thank you Mr. Oswald. This has been one of the greatest summers. Definitely made my top ten. Oh, my gosh, it works! Lizzy... Two down, two to go. Thank you, Oswald. It fits. One more... And then... The meaning of life. Well, maybe we missed one. No, I was really careful. I gotta go to bed. Wait, but we have to retry all of them. It's 2:00 A.M. And I would rather stick a fork in my eye. But, hey, happy birthday officially. You're two hours into being a teenager. Actually, I did the math, and it's the end Of my 13th year on the planet so... Goodnight, fink. Mom. H- hey, mom? Mom. Oh... Hi. Did you find the rest of the keys? Three of them. Oh. Come here. Remember in "the giving tree," When the tree gave the boy all of her apples and branches? Sure, I think we only read it to you About 100 million times. Remember at the end When the tree gave the boy all that she had Until she was nothing but a stump? Sure. That always bothered me. But the tree loved the boy very much. Remember the last line? "and the tree was... " happy, yes. Daddy used to say that you were the giving tree, That you would do anything for us. He said that about me? Yeah. And sometimes I want you to be that. And sometimes I don't. Oh. Okay. I think I understand. Thank you, monkey. I mean Jeremy. You can call me monkey. Yeah? Well, then, happy 13th birthday, monkey. Thanks, mom. Yeah, he got it! He got it! Oh boy, I remember when I turned 13. I was all, hey, where's the secret handshake? You know it? Oh, Jeremy, there is none. You just gotta sink or swim your way through it. And just when you figure out teendom, bang! You're 20, and right there, That's a whole nother set of mysteries to unlock. So happy birthday, kiddo! Thanks. Can we do presents now? Open mine first. It's the best. Slow it down, Lizzy. Elaine first. Thanks. Alright. How did you know? You've only been telling me for 100 years. But this one. A certain Dr. Grady had it delivered. Whoopdy-doo. Now open mine. Okay. It's the ignition key to your time machine, duh? And you didn't tell me? Well, you threw it away! And when your mom saw you took apart the time machine, She made me get it out of the garbage. I got grounded, and I dumpster dived for you. Mom? Jeremy? I love you. I love you too, monkey! It's okay, you can go somewhere else to open it. Wait up! dear Jeremy, I wanna tell you some things I've learned Since I met that fortune teller on my 13th birthday. Of course, it's my hope that I'm with you When you turn 13, but just in case, I'm writing it down. From my 13th birthday forward, I grew up with a deadline over my head. If I only had 40 years, How many more times would I see a sunset Or play in the waves at the beach? How many more times would I hug my son at night? I made sure to be fully in the moment, To pay attention, because that's all life is, Really, a string of moments That you knot together and carry with you. Hopefully, most of those moments are wonderful, But they can't all be. The trick is to recognize an important one When it happens and to hold on tight to it. Inside this box is a record Of what gave meaning to my life. I hope it inspires you to do the same. Rocks? What? "rock number one... The boardwalk at Coney island, age 13." "rock number two... the first flea market "my parents took me to, age 14. "rock three... outside the dance where I met your mom. "rock four... high school graduation. "rock five... The cemetery at my father's funeral. " None of these rocks have numbers on them. I guess it doesn't matter As long as you remember the moment. It's the last one I'm missing. "expect the unexpected. " But I only had ten cards in my collection when your dad died. I know. Well, how did he... I don't know. I gotta go. Wait! Where are you going?! Wait! Where are you going?! What about me?! Lizzy, you've always been there for me and you always will, But I think this is something that I need to do on my own. Okay. Then... Ru-u-u-u-u-n! Rock six... Outside the hospital where you were born. Yes. Rock seven... The first day you said "dad" and all the other moments You made me laugh and filled my life with Joy. I spent a lot of my life thinking it was death That gave meaning to life, but I was wrong. Life and how we choose to live it Is what gives meaning to life. Life is all about the Journey, And I hope this is one you'll never forget. I hope Lizzy is still your best friend And that she's as feisty as ever. Take care of each other and hug your mother for me. More than anything, I hope the string of moments That make up your life delight you and fill you with wonder. Every moment is waiting for you, Jeremy, Starting with this moment. And this one. And this one. They're all yours to celebrate. They're all yours. I love you, Jeremy, and I am so proud of you. Hello, Mr. Oswald? Mr. Oswald? H- hello? Mr. Oswald? what a surprise. Jeremy, what are you doing here? Is Oswald home? Oswald, no. Oswald is in Florida. The keys, remember? Now I'll never know. Never know what? Who set this whole thing up. If Oswald knew about all of it. If Oswald and my dad knew each other Or if this was just some weird coincidence? Well, maybe I can help you. Okay. Well, I have a few technical questions for you. Shoot. How long has Oswald had the keys? Since your dad died. How did my dad and Oswald know each other? They met at a flea market about six years ago. Oswald sold your dad the box. The missing key to the box was the key in my time machine. It was? What do you know about that? I know that Oswald gave that key to your mom When you started building the time machine. Since my dad's funeral. They've been planning this for a long time. everyone has. Everyone? So the security guard? And the police officer? It's amazing what people will do for a good cause. Even Larry the locksmith was in on it. Your dad wanted you to have an incredible 13th birthday, So we were all here to make sure it happened. Oh, everyone did this for my dad. Everyone did this for you. Lizzy's playing card. Your dad signed every card in the deck To make sure he got the right one. How did he know which one was the right one? Lizzy's dad did some snooping. Of course Lizzys dad was in on it. Everybody was. Operation Jeremy fink and the meaning of life. We had code words and secret handshakes. It was fun. Wait, so how did the card get inside the box? Oh, please, Jeremy, you left your bag in my car So many times. That reminds me. Oswald wanted me to mail this to you, but... So it's goodbye again. Where are you going? Me? Off to the next job. Thank you, Jeremy. You're thanking me? For what? For letting me see the world through your eyes. You got a pretty amazing life ahead of you. # come sing me a song # and I will do anything you ask me to # # oh, yeah # oh, yeah # come give us a smile # a million eyes shining down won't see you frown # # oh, yeah # oh, yeah # your love's got a hold on me # # and there's nothing I can be # # without your love # without your love # without your love # without your love # come sell us a dream # I'd buy it now and feel so proud # # oh, yeah # oh, yeah... # we're on a Journey # # better take the long way # there's so much here to explore # # waiting to discover # all the secrets to uncover # # everything that you're searching for # # looking for the meaning # looking for the meaning # looking for the meaning of life # # looking for the meaning # looking for the meaning # looking for the meaning of life # # life is such a mystery # we have to find our own way # # our own special path # we can wander this whole world # # leaving no Stone unturned # the answer's within your grasp # # looking for the meaning # looking for the meaning # looking for the meaning of life # # looking for the meaning # looking for the meaning # looking for the meaning of life # The end
