You know, we're close to that river that used to be Argentina's main trade route into Paraguay. Apparently it used to be a pretty happening town. A lot of smugglers and rough types. Really? I like it already. Pick one. Uh... -this one. Yeah. - This one? Thanks. Here you go. You can keep the change. Thanks. I mean, gracias. De nada. Go on, ask her. - Go. - Um... Buenas tardes. Um, donde est El Hotel Rosarnaria? Okay. Gracias. Did you get all that? Shut up. Hello? Hola. - Hello? - Hola. - Buenas noches. - Buenas noches. Um, me llamo es Stephanie. Mm-hmm. Y nosotros tenemos un, um... You have a reservation? - You speak English. - Yes. Luca. You stay only one night, yes? Yes. Actually, we leave tomorrow. Do you know what time the bus to Posadas leaves? At 8:00. And it's the only one of the day. Please tell me that's 8:00 PM. I'm sorry. It's 8:00 in the morning. Figures. - Your passport, please. - Oh yeah. Ellie. "Assport"? Ellie. That's a good one. You are not traveling alone, are you? Um, well, yes and no. We were traveling with a bike tour but we kind of went AWOL after the first day. Yes, I see. Well, please let me know if you need anything. - Cool. - Thank you. Okay. - Ciao. - Ciao. One key. Oh, gracias. - Ah. - Weirdo. Cute. Yeah, this is cute. Hmm. Whoa! First shower. Ugh, this is gross. Ugh. Hey, Steph. There's no towels. Yeah, coming. Here are your towels. Danke schoen. What did you say to those guys? Nothing, just that you're single. Gee, thanks, El. Okay, I like the potential. Yeah, it's nice. Oh, excuse me. Two cervezas, por favor. Gracias. Is that Nick? Seriously? He's such a dick. I know. But maybe I should just talk to him. No. No no no. Don't even think-- it's so not worth it. I know, but... You know I'm not-- I'm not good at being alone. I know, but I'm right here. Okay? - We had fun. - Yeah, absolutely. We're about to have more fun too. Gracias. Um, disculpe. We didn't order these. Don't be rude. Mmm! Whoo! All right! - No no. - Yeah yeah. - Ellie, no. Seriously, I'm done. - Just shut up and drink. Tomorrow's gonna suck. Yes, but that's what Advil is for. Come on, it's our last night. To you and me. Salud. - I can't-- - That was hard. Whoo. What about him? I don't know. You think he's my type? Totally. He looks... Responsible. Should I invite him over? I can totally invite him over. - No. El, stop. Sit down. - Im gonna do that for you. Jesus, sit down! Sit down! He's gonna look over here, Ellie. - Stay. - Isn't that the point? Oh my God. Are you hearing this? Do you hear this? Please don't tell me you're not hearing this. - What are you doing? - I'm doing us all a favor. Oh no no, you cannot play that song. - Ugh, Ellie. My friend wants to know why you don't like the song. Well, 'cause there's a fine line between irony and just plain bad. Kind of like... Your shirt. All right. No. Nope. Okay. This one's for you, baby. # I love myself # # I want you to love me # # When I feel down, I want you above me # # I search myself, I want you to find me # # I forget myself, I want you to remind me # # I don't want anybody else # # When I think about you # # I touch myself, ooh # # I don't want anybody else... # - Senor. - # Oh no oh no # # Oh no... # Hey hey hey. Take it easy. - No problem here. - # You're the one # # Who makes me come running # # You're the sun who makes me shine # # When you're around I'm always laughing... # Hey, where are you going? Um, el peepee. # I close my eyes and see you above me # # Think I would die if you were to ignore me... # Girl emergency. Sorry. # I'd do anything for you # # I don't want anybody else... # # Oh, I don't want... # You're not from around these parts, are you? Performance anxiety? You should stick close to your friend. Wow. That backfired. # I honestly do, I touch myself # # I touch myself. # - Hello. - Hi. - Do you want to sit? - Yeah. Thank you. - Let me take your picture. - Okay. - Did you get it? - Mm, I got it. Let me take one of you. - You think so? - Yeah, I like it. Now you're my prisoner. Really? - Does that mean I'm in trouble? - Big trouble. What? What does that mean? - It means that you... - Yeah? - ...your friend... - My friend? - ...and I... - Uh-huh. No way, Jose. Not with that one. Mmm. Ooh! Oh my God. You'll wake her up. - Shh. - Shh. Silencio, por favor. Let's go to my place. Your place? No no no. We can't. Who says? - Me says. - Oh, you says? Yeah, me... - Come on, you're gonna love it. - I know I'll love it. I know. I just can't. My friend, she's in... she's inside. Well, tell her to come. Tell her to come. I'm not gonna tell her to come. Come on. I live really close to here. - I don't... we can't. - Okay? - I told you I can't go. - Come on, you're coming with me. I'm not gonna come with you. Okay, all right. This hurts. Ow, stop! What the hell? - Hey! - Let me go! - Get away from me! - Come inside! - Hey hey! - Steph. Come on, we are just having-- Keep 'em closed. He's mean. Oh! - What? Habla la bamba? Girls, open the goddamn door! - Ooh. - Jesus, you trying to get us killed? - Ellie, come outside. Ellie! Hey, asshole. Qu pasa? Qu pasa? Sorry, girls. Maybe next time, all right? You too. Hey, Steph. You saved me. Aw shit. Ellie, get up. We're late. Oh, no no no no. Oh no. Im not kidding, El. - We cannot miss that bus. - Oh no. Wait! Don't leave us here! Wait! No! Oh, we're screwed. - We'll just take the next bus. - There is no next bus. Oh yeah. Why did this have to happen to us on the last day? Everything was going so great until now. Come on, let's go back. So that's flight 206 at 1600 hours. Um, that's 4:00 PM, right? Okay. No, that's fine. Thank you. - Thank you, bye. Are we good? No, Ellie, we're not good. We're both out 200 bucks. Oh my gosh. Wake me up never. Come on, let's at least do something fun. I am doing something fun. You have not left. Oh no. Actually, we missed our bus. But we wanted to go to this place... Villa Del Lago. Have you heard of it? They say the water there can cure polio. I don't have polio. Villa Del Lago. No, it's a ghost town now. There is nothing to see. If you must go somewhere, go to see the waterfalls or to see the caves. - They are beautiful. - That sounds like fun. Ellie. All right, well, thank you. Thank you. That's great. Rosa. - Permiso, chicas. - Thanks. - Come on. - Huh-uh. - Come on, Ellie, let's go. - Huh-uh, no! Wake up. Dude, stop! Oh, look at that. Wow. Hey, let's just lay out here. - Ellie, really? - Come on, just relax. We really don't have anywhere to be. You win. Here, sunshine. It will all be okay. I promise. Thanks, El. - All right. # I'm feeling blind # # Like the sun's in my eyes # # Since I'm fighting in a losing war # # Tiny little fault lines cracking inside my soul... # # I'm alive... # You ready? Ellie, I know you can hear me. - Let's go. - Huh-uh, later. And when exactly is later? I don't know, Steph. When I'm ready. Ow! What the hell? I said I'm not ready. Well, I am. El, we cant be here all day. You really really need to learn to have some fun. And what, you're gonna teach me, I suppose? Yeah, actually. I probably could. Where would we start, huh? The men's bathroom? That sounds like fun. Okay. No, that's great. I see where this is going. - Forget it. - No. Forget it. No, you're right. If you didn't care before attacking him in the bathroom, you're certainly not gonna care now. Okay, Steph, I'm sorry. If it's any consolation, he didn't take the bait. It's still really shitty, Ellie. - I guess you can't help it. - What? You know what? I probably actually should have done something. Because God knows you never would have. What the hell is that supposed to mean? You know what? Just-- just forget about it. No, bullshit forget it. Say what you mean. I mean, Steph, God forbid you take a chance on another guy instead of dwelling on the same old one. He said wed work it out, El. Stephanie, he cheated on you. This is crazy to me that you're still defending him. You should have dumped that guy right on the spot. But you didn't. And now you're hurt and I have to pick up your pieces of yet another disaster relationship. What? Is this coming from you, the expert? You think a relationship is when you get the guy's last name. Wow. You know what? Screw you. Nice. Steph, wait. Where are you going? What do you care? You're on vacation, Ellie. I don't want you to have to worry about cleaning up after me. Have fun. Come on, El, where are you? Oh my-- So it's me. Um, where are you? I'm at the cow place now. Um, okay. So call me. Bye. Hey' - Hi. - Where's your friend? Coming. - Yeah? - Yeah. Any minute now. Oh hey, thanks for your help last night with that guy. - He was a real creep. - Yeah, he was. You know what? Probably got a flat or something. I'd better go. But see you around, uh... - Michael. - Stephanie. Hey, where are you going? I'll give you a lift. No, I'm okay. Thanks though. Wait! No! Somebody! No! No! Hey' You follow me here? Yeah. I just wanted to make sure you were all right. Are you? 'Cause you don't look it. Her bike is gone. Well... Well, maybe she left already. No, there's only one road. I mean, we would have passed each other. Right. I'm gonna go inside and look for her. Are you sure this is the place? - Yeah, I'm positive. Do you hear that? - It's over here somewhere. - Ellie! Who are you calling? The police. Good luck with that. - Hola. - Hola. - Michael. - Calvo. - What did he say? - We're gonna show him. Here, give me the phone. Calvo. - What did he just ask? - He asked... Why were you and your friend not together? We got separated. Separated? How did you get separated? It was stupid. We got in a fight. Oh. Well, I am sure she will forgive you. Wait, where are you going? Your friend is fine. When she realizes she has lost her phone she will come back to find it. Senor, please wait. Where are you going? Calvo. Michael. Do yourself a favor and find another lover. This one has a habit of losing his girlfriends. Hey. Hey! I am very sorry, but I... She was with a guy last night. What did he look like? He was tall. He had brown hair. Brown hair? You just described half of Argentina. - Did you get his name? - No, I didn't. - Could you identify him? - Yeah. Yeah, if I saw him again I'm sure I could. Well, when you do see him you can call me, but now there is nothing I can do. Please. Please. Okay. You may make a report if you want. Yeah, that... thank you. Can I ride with you? - Of course. - Okay. You want me to come with you? No, Michael. Thank you. I think I can handle the situation from here. Yeah, I'll be fine. Just because he speaks English does not mean you should trust him. I don't know if I trust anybody right now. All done. Wait, that's it? - That's it. - No. We should be out there looking for her. I mean, we can still make a search party before it gets dark. A search party? Where do you think you are? This is not America. Does it look like I can make a search party? Then what else can we do? Today? Nothing. Nothing? Please, you should not worry so much. Your friend is just having her fun. My friend is not out there having fun, okay? I know her. She wouldn't just leave me like this. The way you left her alone in a foreign country? I'm sorry. I will do everything in my power. You have my word. This is so messed up. Is there someone else I can talk to? You're tired. Why don't you go back to the hotel and take a siesta? You want me to take a nap while my best friend is missing? Yes. I think you will feel much better. It's okay. Look, if she's not back tomorrow, we'll file a missing persons report with federal police in Buenos Aires. Okay? Okay. Good. Everything will be all right. You'll see. Disculpe me. Uh... I'm looking for my friend. Senora. I'm just looking for my friend. Mi amiga. Senora? Oh, excuse me. Can you help me? I'm looking for my friend. I can't find her. Senora? I just want to ask... - I just... Senora, please. Hey, wait. Hey! I just want to talk to you. Wait. Hey! Ellie? Hello? - Michael? I'm sorry. I've got to go. Look what I found. It was in his room. - It's Ellie's. - Whose room? Michael's. Okay. I will question him, but only if you go back to the hotel and wait for me. You let me do my job. Is that fair? - Okay. - Good. What's wrong? Ellie's gone. Gone? We got in a fight and I went on without her. I've got to-- I've got to find her. Come inside. Have something to drink. Come on. it's okay. Come on. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Hey' - Please don't! No! - Just wait! - No, let me go! - Hey! I won't hurt you. - Hey. Hey. - Stop, no! Stop it! - Get off me! - I'm not gonna hurt you. What's the matter with you? Where did you get this? You went through my things? Where did you get this? Look, it belongs to someone I know. Bullshit! This is Ellie's. What did you do with her? Look, I swear to God I've got nothing to do with your friend, okay? You have to trust me. Look. Look, please. Would you just take a look at this? Okay? Just take a look at it. Her name is Camila. She disappeared somewhere around here. That's her bracelet. I've been up and down these roads Oh God. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. You know, when we met she was organizing a humanitarian mission to South America. And I wanted to be with her so I went too. What happened? About six months ago we came to work here. One day she took the truck into town to get some supplies and that's the last I saw of her. Nobody knows what happened. And if they do, they're not saying anything. I'd do anything to get her back. And I'm not leaving this country until I find her. Did you call the police? Calvo? Yeah, he filled out a form. Oh no. God. I'm gonna be sick. Oh God. I can't.... Look, I've been hearing things about young women, girls, who've been abducted and taken across the river into Paraguay. I don't know if that's what's happened to your friend. I mean, it's rare. it's risky to kidnap an American. But it does happen. That's why I tried to warn her. Oh. I have to find her. I have to find Ellie. Okay. Well, I mean, chances are she's probably still in the area. It's too risky to move her during daylight. But we need to find her before it gets dark. - How? - We need to split up. Now I'll understand if you don't want to do that. But we can cover more ground if you do. No, you're right. You're right. Okay, I'll meet you back here in an hour. Yeah. Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! - Oh shit. Michael, you're becoming a hard man to find. Surely you must be lost. You know me, just seeing the sights. Yes, of course you are. Have you seen Stephanie? No. Because a car has been stolen and that does not happen very often around here. Wow. A stolen car. Did you find Stephanie's friend? I was going to ask you the same thing. So her friend is still missing and you're looking for a car? Okay. Come with me. Let's take a drive. Water. Chucho, I know you're not a bad guy. I can tell by the way you kissed me. Come here and kiss me again. Come here. Come here. So you want that? I want you. No! Help! - Hey hey. No! Oh my God! -Don't! No! Bastard ! Shh. You fucking bastard. Help me! Stop it! Fuck you! Oh God, get me out of here, please. Well, seems that tonight is your night. Listen. Don't you move, okay? Steph. Hurry hurry. - Ellie. Ellie, are you okay? - Steph. - Are you okay? - I just want to go home. - Let's go home. - We're gonna go home. Shh Shh. - Get this off me. - Hold still. - You can do it, right? - Oh, he's coming! - Shit. Come on. Come on. - Hey! Hey! Let's go! - Ellie, come on. Hurry hurry. - Go, go. Lock it! Lock it! - Oh God! Oh God! - Go, Steph, now. Come on, go. - Oh shit. - Get it! Get it! - Shit. - Come on, come on, come on! Okay okay okay. Open the door. - Steph, watch out! - Come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on! Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Shh. - No! Watch out! Wait, stop! Ellie. Ellie. Oh my God. Oh my God. Ellie, come on. Oh my God. Ellie, please. Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Hey, get off of her! - Ellie. Ellie, please. Ellie. She's dead! She's dead! Oh my God. Stephanie, is this the man you say was with your friend the other night? - Yes! - Stephanie, get into the truck. It's for your safety. Trust me. Now! Oh my God. She was very desirable. What a waste. "Assport"? Clever. That's a good one. Michael! it's him, Michael! - Michael! - But that one will do fine in her place, don't you think? - Michael. - Shut up. Get away from the car. Where is she? Just put the gun down. Where's Camila? Michael, we can still help each other. - But you must put the gun down. - On your knees. Shut up! On your knees. Think for a second. If you kill me then who will tell you where to find Camila? Just put the gun down and let's talk, okay? Man to man. I think we can work out something that will satisfy us both. - Where is she? - She's safe. Trust me. - Where is she? I swear to you no harm has come to her. Okay. I can bring her to you, but we must trade. You piece of shit. This is the only way. Stephanie for Camila. It's simple, Michael. Stephanie for Camila. No. I'm sorry. Michael, no! I hope you're going to be a good girl and play nice. 'Cause if you give me any trouble, I swear I will cut you so bad you will not even make $10 per day sucking cock in the streets. Please. What if I told you that you are only worth $2,000? $6,000 if you're a virgin, but-- are you a virgin? Get away! Stop it! Stop. No. No, I don't think you're a virgin. Please. I'm sorry. Don't worry, you're American, not some brown peasant. You're worth much more. It's lucky for you my partner across the river is open-minded. You see, he is a businessman too. And they think you could make a nice accessory for one of his clients. Night night. - Get up. I should kill you. Then you would owe me a lot of money. Pick her up. - I don't like this. - What's not to like? - This is what we discussed. - This is dangerous. Girls like her-- people will look for her. Then put her someplace no one will find her. So easy for you. Please. Please. Your greed is going to get you killed one day. And you, you'd better be worth the trouble. Never! Help! Help! Help, somebody! Help! Please! Please wake up! Please help me. Help me, please! Help me! Stephanie, please. Give me the gun. Come on. Be a good girl. Just give me the gun! it's okay. it's okay. # When I woke this morning # # I saw that you were still gone # # And just for the weekend # # Just sayin' I think that's way too long # # I toss in these sweaty sheets, no sleep # # The clock is wailing on and on and on and on # # Who in the hell was I to come here # # All alone on my own? # # But you you you # # I love you # # More than I ever wanted to # # It's all I am # # All I do is sit around # # And remember you # # I'm on my knees now # # Please turn around and come home # # I left my cold soul on the ground # # I can't believe I'm falling apart # # I need your needle in my arm # # 10cc might suit me # # I'd rather all day than go without # # Your arms # # I'm drying up without this cocoon # # Well, I want to be your monarch # # Pin me up to the wall in your bedroom # # But you you you, I love you # # More than I ever wanted to # # It's all I am # # All I do is sit around # # And remember you # # I'm on my knees now # # Please turn around and come home # # I left my cold soul on the ground # # I'm all alone # # I'm all alone # # I'm on my knees # # I'm all alone # # I'm begging you # # Come back to me # # Come back to me # # I'm on my knees now... # # Please turn around and come home # # I left my cold soul on the ground # # Come home, come home # # Come home # # Don't leave me here # # Please, turn around. #
