Night-night, Susie. Night, mommy. She's going to be a beauty, isn't she? Of course, dear. A beauty. [door creaking] [breathing] [crying] Daddy! Daddy! Aah! Aah! Oh! You've left that door unlocked again. You've left that door unlocked again! No! No, John! Please don't be violent. No! No! No! No. No. No. Please. No. [mother crying] Easy. Easy. This way. Easy. Come on. Come on. [door locks] Stop! Please stop! I'm sorry. Cigarette? I don't want to go back there. That's all there is to it. The nearer I-- The nearer I get, the worse I feel about it. Isn't it stupid? No, it's not stupid. You must think you married some sort of nut. Hope not. Why am I so scared of going back there? I was a little girl. I don't remember anything. My mind's a total blank. Blanks are rarely total, And I don't think your mind Is as blank as you'd like it to be. That's your trouble. Are you going to insist Upon being older and wiser? I don't need it! What was that about a cigarette? It'd be the easiest thing in the world To turn the car around and go back to New York. Oh, Mike... I don't deserve you. I'm just an ignorant, overemotional juvenile. No, you're a highly intelligent young woman. At least that's the impression I had. If I find I'm wrong, I'll throw you in the nearest ditch without a backward look. I don't believe you. You'd look back. Maybe one quick glance. To see if I hurt myself when I hit the ditch, right? Yeah. [music plays] Anybody home? [horn sticks] [horn turns off] Lookin' for somebody? Yes. Are you the gentleman who runs that ferry? That's right. Could you take us across? Don't lead nowheres. The other side's the ocean. No hotels nor nothing. How much for the trip? $10. Come on, Barry. Looks like we got business. $10. He saw us coming... For Miles. Come on, fella. What are you waiting for? Ha ha ha ha ha. Come on. Don't be scared, mister. You ain't going to hurt her none. Ha ha ha ha. So long, fella. Thank you. Thank you. [horn honks] Hey! Hey, buddy! [shouting] Move! Hey, move over, will ya, man? Move! [honking] Move! Whee! Oh! Oh! Oh! What'd you let go for, stupid? [groaning] Is he going to be all right? Yeah, sure. He scratched himself on a piece of barbed wire. That's careless. Oh. I wonder if you could tell me Where I could find Zebulon Whately. Yeah, sure. Um... How many guesses do I have? He's in the forge. Thank you. If you can walk that far. Thank you. [banging] Mr. Whately? Mr. Zebulon Whately? Mornin'. Can I be of help? Mr. Whately? Lots of people around here named Whately. I'm looking for a Mr. Zebulon Whately. I think that's the way you say it. Zebulon. That's correct. Zebulon. Where could I find-- I'm Zebulon Whately. Oh. Hey, this is crazy. Woof! You folks on one of these "see the USA first" tours? I mean, this ain't exactly no beauty stop. At least not until you came along. Well, I was born on this island. My name is Susannahh Whately. You're kidding? I'm glad to know you. You might say we're related. I'm married to your niece. My niece? She's in the car. Would you like to say hello? Susannah? The one that was raised in New York? Why'd you bring her here? Do I have to have a reason? If I were you, mister, I'd turn that pretty car around And go right back where you come from. What's your name? Susannah. What's yours? Lisa! Lisa, come here! I told you not to speak to strangers. You know, that Mrs. Sutley, She believes in those stories About New Yorkers eating children. Do you? Yeah, sure. It's possible. Especially on hot nights. That mill wheel's been rusted up solid 16, 17 years, Ever since Susannahh's pa and ma died. Ain't no use for nothin' these days. We don't intend milling corn. Can't get in there. It's locked. The lawyer sent us the keys. Lawyer? Yes, on my wife's 21st birthday. 21? Is she? You're sure you wouldn't like to meet your niece? Is she beautiful? Very. Tait, come here. I wouldn't take her into that old house, mister, 'less you want her to end up like this. Hey, fellas. She says she's one of us. Born here. What do you think of that? Ha ha ha. How do you do, ma'am? She doesn't look like nothing we've ever seen here. Does she? We're happy to welcome you back. Ain't we? Yeah. Yeah. I wandered to that place a couple of years back. Was liquored up, figured to sleep in the mill So my wife wouldn't smell whiskey on me. In the night, the hot breath of hell blow in my face. There was beelzebub rushing down on me, And from his mouth A red-hot tongue of flame that smote me in the eye. I ran out so fast, Even the devil couldn't catch me, And I'm advising you right now, Don't go near it. There's no one but demons lives there, And they don't take to strangers No more than we do. Miss Susannahh, I want you to meet big Rick. Oh! Oh. Oh, Rick's hurt. You hurt, Rick? Yeah, Rick's hurt. Oh! Get him, Rick! Get him, Rick! You go get him, Rick! [cheering and clapping] Get him! Come on! You get him, there! Ha ha ha ha! [engine starts] Where are they going? They're going to open up the old mill, Use it as a Summer home, they reckon. Aunt Agatha! Aunt Agatha! Aunt Agatha! Aunt Agatha! Yes, boy? The Whately mill, is it mine or not? Will be one day. When? When I'm gone. Who's Susannahh Whately? Come up here, boy. What do you hear about Susannahh Whately? I just seen here with her fancy husband and fancy car. Where are they headin'? To my mill! Zeb told them how to get there. She's come back. Well... All I can say is it looks, um... Ghastly? Gruesome? No, I was trying to think of something more like, um... Delightful. How about... Frightful? Come on. Darling. Darling. Did you feel it? Feel what? When you opened that door, It was like I was standing in front of a refrigerator. I didn't want to walk in in case I froze to death. Aren't I stupid? No, you're not stupid. What am I afraid of? Some bogeyman who once played the starring role In the nightmare of a little girl. Maybe she ate too much apple pie That particular night for supper. That's about it. Mmm. Ha ha. Some dream I once had, that's all? What do you think? That I'm getting dangerously close To being discarded in that ditch, right? Look, you're doing fine. You're doing fine, But I'd like to catch up with that bogeyman And ask him a few questions. Wait a minute. I'm only going back there On your personal guarantee That he isn't around anymore. This must be the place. Michael. Where are you? You know what they say-- Cleanliness... Is next to godliness. [gasps] What is it? Ha ha ha ha. Cobwebs. Oh. Ha ha. Darling, don't ever do that to me again. I'm glad you're here. Oh, I didn't mean to disturb nothing. I can come back later if you folks are busy. What is it? I got a message to hand on to the lady. Mornin' again, ma'am. Nice to see you again... Uh, so soon. You have a message for me? Yeah, from your Aunt Agatha. She says if you want to visit, She'd be glad to see you. Aunt Agatha? She used to take care of me When I was a little girl. Fine. We'll drop by this afternoon. Oh, it's a pretty tough place to locate. If you want to come now, I'll show you where it is. All right. You won't get that machine up there. You got to use boot leather. [whistling] O.K., honey. Come on. Come on. Come on. What's keeping you? Here. Come on. Thank you. [Ethan whistling] [whistling the wedding March] [humming the wedding March] Come on. Move it. "John & Mary Whately." My mother and father. Are you coming? Oh, you got plenty of time to visit them folks. They ain't goin' nowheres. Why wasn't I told? Why did I have to wait Till I was almost grown up To find out who I am? [awk awk] [woman laughin Oh! Tell your mistress there are folks here to see her. What are you waiting for? Ahem. If I were you, I wouldn't sit, Not unless the old lady says so first. If you don't act pleasing to her, Your aunt's likely to put a spell on you. She's got enough stuff there to cure most anything. She put her mind to it, She could make you blind for a week. Maybe you ought to play it safe and get up. Oh, I'm not so sure I believe it, But some folks do. She's a-comin'. I bet they cost $2.00 a pair, them hose. 10, at least. Yeah? $5.00 each leg. Isn't she great at figures? Ha ha ha. Aunt Agatha. Susannah Whately. It's almost too wonderful to be true. I prayed and prayed, And my prayers have been answered Beyond my wildest dreams. You've grown into a beauty, my child, A beauty, Just like your mother, God rest her. Aunt Agatha. You remember me? Yes... Yes, I do. You were standing on the dock, Waving goodbye to me, And you were crying. You remember. And you were only 4 years old. Who is this man? My husband Mike Kelton. Is she happy? You make her happy? I try. See you do. There's been enough misery In the Whately family, And this island has seen it all. That's why you were sent away, To be reared elsewhere To save you from it. You mustn't tempt fate by tarrying here. Begone now before anything happens to you. Ethan... Take them across in your boat. Oh, they got a-- they got an automobile. Well, sail across and fetch Wilkes and his car ferry. Tell him these people are returning To the mainland before nightfall. Wait a minute. It's nice of you to help, But we like it here. We may stay a few days. You can't stay in that mill house. Oh, what a pity. It'd make a great Summer house With paint and the services Of a cobweb-disposal firm. No, you'll start it up again. With a Whately living there, No one will be safe on this island. You'll start it up again for sure-- Evil. Excuse me if I find that difficult to understand. There's a lot of things city folks don't understand, Mr. Kelton, Even with their scientific know-how. There are things they have no way of knowing, No way of figuring out. Like the Whately curse? Yes, Mr. Doubting Thomas, The Whately curse. You don't know where it come from, But it's there. How does a chicken know When a fox is hiding behind a bush, ready to spring? That chicken can't see the fox, Can't smell the fox, But it knows the fox is there. Now, a chicken is a stupid creature. All it does is run around in circles and cluck. You linger around looking for proof, And you'll end up like the chicken, With your neck tore out. Do I, um... Detect a threat there somewhere? I'm not threatening you, But I see you're beginning to sense danger. That's a good sign. I'm glad you think there's hope for me. There's hope for you, Mr. Kelton, Because you're not a Whately. But there's no hope for Susannahh If she spends even one night in that house. Well, thanks for the chat. I found it quite informative. Maybe we'd better be on our way, Susannahh. It's not exactly a good road. Did you ever hear what happened to your wife's parents? Struck by lightning, both killed instantly. Their faces were horribly burned. Do you have to tell us things like that? Her ma and pa died violently. So did her aunt and uncle. How many more Whately deaths Do you need before you leave? I sent her away to protect her. Why'd you bring her back? Can I ask you a question? Yes. Does, um... Does this fella bite? Of course he does. That's how he stays alive. No power on earth Could tame a creature like that. He remains as God made him, No matter how much we try to civilize him. That's why I love him. Ohh. Hey. The road's up there. [Ethan laughing] Histng] [awk] [awk] Are they staying in my mill or ain't they? Seems like they are. Why'd you say it was mine When you knew about her all the time? What'st matter? You'd never have the nerve to set foot in that house. Would you spend one afternoon there alone? No. No. I'd burn t mill and use the land, but... I wouldn'ttay in that use. No, sir. Oh, no, sir. If I'd known about the family curse, I'd have had you fumigated before the ceremony. "spend one night in that house And the Whately curse will get you." brrrr... I feel a bit silly being so afraid before. She's a great old girl. I like her. She should be saying all those things in any other century. The moment I saw her I remembered her. She was around all the time when I was little. I hope she came the short way. Maybe she rode up on her eagle. Or her broomstick. Hey, what kind of room is that? Oh, the wagons used to pull up here. That chain would pick up the sacks. Let's see what's there. No. We haven't seen the house yet. What are you doing? There's no hotel on the island. We'll have to spend the night here. Of course. Shall we take another crack at it? Let's go. Shall we? After you. That's where my parents slept. I just know it. And through there... Was my bedroom. How strange. I didn't expect to remember anything. I do. My doll. My cot. I don't think anybody's been in here since they sent me away. Nothing's been touched. The doll's house. I used to be afraid That someone... Or something Was hiding in it, watching me. Some nights I couldn't sleep... Because I was sure that there were people in there... Staring out at me through the windows. No. I can't remember anything anymore. Just a feeling... A feeling that when I was a child, There was something in this room that was hostile, Angry towards me. A power terribly, terribly strong. Hey... Look at this. A genuine, early American sweeping tool. Ha ha ha. Do you a lot of good to get rid of some of these old cobwebs. We'll clean the place up together. How about that? No. I'll do it. I want to. You go to the store, get some food, And we'll have a picnic. Sure you'll be OK Here alone? I'll be fine. Now, beat it. O.K. %% %% %% [music stops] He's left his wife alone there. Susannah... Susannah. Susannah! Aah! Where'd your wife go? [seagulls] On your way. Didn't know where I was, I tell ya. Oh...Aah! [splash] Hey! Hey, Mr. New York! I got something to tell ya. Oh... I got something-- Oh, let me catch my breath. Oh... Wow. You own this? Yes. You own it or you're paying for it? You, um, said you had something to tell me. You aren't going to stay in there, are you, With the curse and all? What have you come to tell me? 'bout your wife. The fellas are after her. [shouting] How 'bout a go, now, baby? Hey, Elmer, where you going? [shouting] Go! Go! Go! Mike! Mike... Oh... [wolf whistle] Doing anything tonight, baby? Hey, pop! Pop... I got something to tell you. Wanna hear it? Ha ha ha. Hey, I like the taste of your wife's ears. She's so white. White like a bed sheet straight out of the laundry. She looks at you like you was about to dirty her. That's hot! You need it hotter to cleanse your sinful thoughts. And her hair... I bet you a dollar she washes her hair every day. It's silky. You can tell because it blows in the wind. I'm rning you, boy, Get your thoughts off another man's wife Or you're headed straight for hell. So what? Ever been to New York? Sure. Lots of times. Yeah? You never told me. Shut up. You gotta take me to the city one of these days. Take me to the airport. I've always wanted to see the wheels come down. All my life I've seen them go over But never coming down From all those places. Shut up, will ya? Shut up. [child screaming] Please don't be violent, John. You've left the door unlocked again. Why? John, please... The door... Please, John... [child screaming] Daddy! [woman] Susannahh. %% Susannahh %% Mother. Su-san-nah. Memories? Yes. [horn sticks] [horn blaring] Hee hee hee. [horn blaring] [horn blaring] Aah! [horn stops] Ohh... Ohh, ohh... Come on. Now... Come on. Come on. [whimpering] Easy... Easy. [chain rattles] Thank God. I'm sure your explanation will satisfy me Once I've heard it. I don't think you believe What I told you about the Whately curse. One doesn't run into many curses on Madison avenue, At least not the kind you're talking about. I knew you were going to be hard to convince. Forgive me-- Though I respect your right to believe. But I don't. I beg your pardon. I never believed it. I invented it in the first place. The moment I met you, I knew you were a remarkable woman. I had to invent something... To make those superstitious islanders Afraid to go near that mill for their own safety. Hey, you wanna drive more careful? This ain't no express highway. Out of my way, please. Just offering you a piece of friendly advice. Thanks. Now, I'm in a hurry. Can I ride along? Where are you going? Same way you're going. All right. Jump in, but hurry. Hey, is this next year's model? Hey, she really takes off, doesn't she? Power. That's what you gotta have, right? What's your line of work? I edit a magazine. No kidding? A movie star magazine? Maybe I read it all the time. I don't think so. No? Maybe not. We don't get some On account of we ain't got no use for them. See them pylons? Bringing electricity into your home To power better things for better living. Only we ain't got no electricity Unless we generate our own. Them pylons walked right over this island Like it was somewhere to wipe your boots. They don't stop here. They just keep right on going. That's one magazine wouldn't have much sale here, One with electric toothbrushes, Such like fancy gadgets. One of these nights... I'm gonna get me a bunch of dynamite, And I'm gonna knock one of them pylons right over. Then I'm gonna sit back And listen to all the squawking When you city folks wake up and plug everything in. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha! [chain rattles] [rattling] [rattling] [gasp] Aah! Lookin' for me? 'cause I was looking for you. Got a couple things to talk about. Please, I have to see my husband. What's wrong with passing the time of day with me? What's wrong with that? We got the same aunt. That makes us, uh, relations, don't it? Please... This is where I am. Over here. You see anything? You're hurting me! Oh, that proves I'm around here someplace, don't it? That's good to know. I got the idea there was just you and a lot of air. I was beginning to worry. Gee... Your eyes are beautiful. No. Ahh! [honking horn] [honk] Come on, give me one of those fancy punches Right there. Come on. Show me. What kind of stuff you throwing there, chief? That's some kind of imported fighting, ain't it? How'd you like to try some of this? This is strictly homegrown. Uhh. Hey, chief, That sure is a lovely wife you got there. I hear she's just as pretty all over. Ain't that right? You wouldn't know what your wife's doing right now, would you? Hey, guys, where's Ethan? Hey, maybe Ethan knows what this guy's wife is doing. Maybe this guy's wife Knows what Ethan is doing. 'cause maybe they is doing the same thing. Ha ha ha. Together. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! [thunk] [whistling the wedding March] Hey! Let's see if he's chicken. Hey, that's a peachy idea. [whooping] That's it. Hold him down. Hold him down. Hold him down. Hold him down. Ugh! [whooping] Tie him up. Tie him up. Don't you worry, now. No, no. Just take it easy. Ha ha ha. Just stay there. We're just going for a little walk. Just stay there. O.K. [whooping] Whoo! Come on, cowboy! That's right! Come on, let's try it. Come on, boys. Come on. Hold on down there, big daddy, We're coming to get you! Stay right there. We're coming to get you. Can I come in there? Wait a minute. Let me help you. If I can't stop you, Let me help you. Is this what you want? Is it? You animal! [shouting] Come back here! Hey, you come back here! Come back, you New York bastard! You viper! Witch. You're a witch. You hear? Where are you? [squeak] Yah! Aah! My... My sister. I know, darling. Aunt Agatha told me. Ugh...Ugh... Uhh... Uhh...Uhh... Ugh! [whimpering] [whimpering] Darling... Darling... I'll take you home, darling. Let's take you home. No. No. Darling. Ahh...Ahh... Please...Please... Please... Save her. Give me the key to that chain. Give me the key to the chain. Hurry. Come on. Why? I promised your mother to care for her always And to keep you from learning the truth. Oh, Lord in Heaven, How many's the time That I prayed to be released from that promise? Aah! Aah! Aah! Let me take her, Mr. Kelton. I know how to handle her. Give her to me. I'll--I'll calm her down. That's all right. Let her go. Lead the way, please! I can't see through the smoke. Open up! Open this door! It's best this way, Mr. Kelton. Aah!
