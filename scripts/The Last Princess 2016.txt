Good morning, Department Head. Welcome. Good morning. Reporter Lee, I haven't seen many reports lately. Look this over. Oh, sure. Thank you, Department Head. Welcome. Welcome, Department Head Kim. The new government will promote the 6th Korea-Japan talks. Department Head, it's Japan. Please transfer the call to the Department Head's desk. The call is transferred. We found her! We found the princess. Did you hear me? Where is she living? I understand. We'll talk later. Has she been found? That's great! Then you should go on the trip this time instead of me. Thank you. Have a drink. My child. There will be a lot of good things in the New Year. (GOJONG, THE EMPEROR GWANGMU) Yes, Your Majesty. Your Majesty, we will shoot on the count of 3. One. Two. Three. (1919 DEOKSUGUNG PALACE) Agassi! Agassi! Agassi!... [young lady] Your Majesty, the news of your disapproval of this union seems to have reached the ears of the Emperor of Japan. And so? We will arrange a date to travel to Japan. Telling me I should go kneel down, can you still be considered one of my subjects? Can you still be considered one of my subjects? I am now... (LEE WAN YONG, PRIME MINISTER) Your Majesty's subject. Your Majesty's subject. I do not approve of a union between Joseon and Japan. This is for the sake of our people and our country. Under the rule of Japan, Joseon will become even more rich and powerful. Yes, it is possible everyone will prosper. You 150,000. You 100,000. Wan Yong, are you the second or third wealthiest in Joseon? Even if you desire nothing but personal gain, do you have nothing to sell but your country? You rotten fellows will leave a dirty stain on our history! Father! Agassi, you cannot! Please let me hide behind you. Okay, my child. I heard you sent a secret envoy to the International Peace Conference. That was stupid. Please apologize to the Emperor of Japan, Your Majesty. Even if I die, something like that will never happen. Disrespectful fellow. Move out of the way. He said he was leaving for Shanghai tonight, right? Yes, Your Majesty. After meeting Mr. Wu Dang, he will convey your decision. This will be our last chance, so please be careful. Yes. Did you call my nephew to come here? Yes, Your Majesty. Let him in. Yes. Come a bit closer. You're quite handsome. Who is this? "Jang" meaning seal. "Han" meaning endurance. I am Kim Jang Han. Jang meaning seal. Han meaning endurance. Your name is Jang Han? Yes, Your Majesty. You are the second son of General Kim Hwang Ah, head of the Manchurian Restoration Army. The death of your father must have been a great blow to you. Since you have taken care of me like a father, it has given me a lot of comfort. Then why have you rejected becoming my son-in-law? To continue my late father's wishes, I plan to join the independence movement. I was thinking of retreating to Shanghai. Now the whole world will know what things the Japanese have done. But if things don't go well, I don't know what may happen to the princess. I would like for you to protect my princess well, so she won't be killed by the Japanese. Despite your young age, I have decided it would be best for you and Princess Deok Hye to be married. Your Majesty, I have brought your cinnamon punch. Come in. Father! Father, look at this! This is the painting I made. What are you doing? Don't come any closer. Don't! Father. Don't. Father. No. What's wrong? Don't. Father, what's wrong? Child. Father, what's wrong? Father, please get up! Father! Father! Father! Father, what's wrong? Father, get up! Father! Father! Father! The state funeral of King Gojong, under the supervision of the Japanese military chief, was carried out in the Japanese style. Suspicion that he had been poisoned aroused anger in the Joseon people. This incident became the root of resistance against Japanese colonial rule. Then the "March 1st Manse Demonstrations" lit the fuse. "Princess Deok Hye" - =1925 Changdeok Palace, Gwanmul Pavilion) Agassi! Come in. Young Master Jang Han is here. Have you been well? Hello, Princess. No news at all. I thought you had forgotten me. Should we play a bit? It's a song I wrote called "The Rat." Try to follow along. You play well. It looks like it's from Advisor Han Taek Su. He'd like you to wear it for the event tomorrow. What are you going to do? Just set it on fire? No. He wants it to be worn. (CHILD CARE CENTER) Princess! Princess! Hello, Your Highness. Welcome. Hello. This way please. These clothes are really uncomfortable. I was confused whether I could even wear a coat or not. Just endure it for a while. No pictures! What's going on? It's the hope of Joseon! Princess, what is this about? Is there something wrong? Did you not expect anyone else to be here? Surely... you didn't expect a Korean princess to wear the kimono you sent over. Bok Sun, you bitch... Is it unattractive? Let's go, Bok Sun. Is it unattractive? Why did they tell us to come if we can't take pictures? Princess! Thank you. Children, shall we sing the princess a song? Yes! Begin. Very cute. Impudent. You were shamelessly boasting how this publicity would create unity. But you were outsmarted by this little girl. My apologies. With the princess as the center, the spirit of the Korean people is on the rise. The Princess is a dangerous person. We have heard from the Emperor of Japan. Our princess has finally been granted noble status in the Royal Palace. Congratulations. Deok Hye, congratulations. Advisor Han, you've worked very hard. I'll prepare everything for her to study abroad in Japan. Since our princess has finally become nobility, shouldn't she also have an education befitting an aristocrat? Your Majesty, the Princess should stay in Joseon. Didn't King Gojong arrange a marriage for her? Royal Consort Yang, don't interfere if you don't understand anything. Education and marriage of palace nobility is the jurisdiction of the advisor's office, don't you know? Deok Hye, what do you think? How can we abandon the will of King Gojong? Your Majesty. Drag Royal Consort Yang out of here. Prince Eun was sent away at age 13 and never returned! Do you want that to also happen to the Princess? You cannot! You absolutely cannot! Please protect her, Your Majesty! Advisor Han, you must have lost your mind. I don't want to go. It appears the safety of Royal Consort Yang is not important. What do you mean by that? I mean that I may not be able to ensure the safety of Royal Consort Yang. It seems you're admitting that my father was poisoned. Your father passed away from a serious illness. The order is from the Emperor, but the decision will be yours. If you refuse, the entire Joseon royal family will be in imminent danger. Please understand this very clearly. We will send clothes over again. This time, don't play any games. I used to be a housemaid. Did you know? Mother. I have a favor to ask. You have to promise me. I've always wanted to wash your feet for you. Can't you just say this time that you're unable to go? I'll come back as soon as I finish my studies. Don't worry. Princess, you must come back. No matter what happens, you must come back. I will. Mother, just call me Deok Hye. I really want to hear you say my name again. It's my wish. Be sure to always bring this thermos with you. In an enemy country, you can't drink just any cup of water. Always remember how your father passed away. Yes, Mother. I'm going. Agassi! Agassi! (1961 - TOKYO HANEDA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT) Seonim! Seonim! [Eldest brother] How long since we last met? It's already been 30 years. Seonim. We meet again like this in Japan. Let's go. This way. (LEE BANG JA (MASAKO NASHIMOTO) WIFE OF CROWN PRINCE EUN (KING YEONGCHIN)) After the war ended, all of our assets were returned to the South Korean government. Life has been very difficult. His Majesty has always longed for his homeland. Recently, we heard news that the Princess was missing. Do you happen to know her whereabouts? His Majesty has felt very guilty toward the Princess. He was afraid people would laugh at her. Apparently, every month he sent money to some people, but he never told me who it was. I hope you will help me look for the Princess. (PRINCE AKASAKA HOTEL, FORMER RESIDENCE OF CROWN PRINCE EUN) Do you have a reservation? Would it be okay if I just looked around? Okay. Thank you. 2nd lieutenant Kim of the Japanese Imperial Army. (KING YEONGCHIN [CROWN PRINCE EUN], SON OF GOJONG) You've finally arrived. You've finally arrived. This is the 2nd lieutenant just appointed as my aide. This is Princess Deok Hye. It's nice to meet you. This is my wife. I am Masako. We have been waiting for you. Are you that Korean? The one who graduated in 2nd place from the military academy? Yes, that's right. I am Han Taek Su, the royal advisor. It's too bad. It you had been born in Japan, it would have been better. I think my loyalty to the emperor would not have been diminished. Unpack and get ready for dinner. How about a cup of tea before dinner? Princess. I am Jang Han. How can you be here? The Japanese uniform suits you. When we heard you were coming, we had them prepare sashimi. Well, let's eat. I will enjoy the meal, Your Highness. This is quite delicious. Why aren't you eating? I'm still not used to this type of food. A Japanese Imperial soldier still can't eat this. Try something. You might love it as much as I do. How is it? Very good. I'm glad. I guess I will come to enjoy sashimi. Our Princess still hasn't developed a taste for sashimi. Why did you postpone my return home? Since I've already graduated, please keep your promise. Deok Hye, let's discuss this matter later. Korea and Japan are one. As Japan and Korea are one, is there still a need for you to return? I'll request the royal family to arrange a good marriage for you. Your joking has gone too far. My stomach doesn't feel well, so I'll leave first. Your Highness, eat a bit of this. I suppose the Queen sent this for me. Please just eat a little. Today I was really craving some Korean food. Your Highness, I'm sure you'll be able to return, so just be a little patient. After we get back, I'll make you some extra spicy kimchi soup. (PRINCE YI WU, GOJONG'S GRANDSON) It's been a long time, Aunt. I thought you were in Shanghai. I came back not long ago. Have you been doing well? How would that be possible? I keep waiting for the day I can return to Joseon. Let's go. I'll send you back to Joseon. You've come. Is everyone here? Yes. Please come in. Come this way. I'm sorry we're late. Welcome. Comrade Kim, is everything going smoothly? Very smoothly. Good work. Please come over here. This side. Your attention. This is my aunt, Princess Deok Hye. - Welcome. - We are Joseon students studying abroad. You're very welcome. Hello. I'm Yi Deok Hye. Now that everyone is here, let's begin the meeting. We found this.(EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF JAPAN-KOREA UNITY. THE NUMBER OF KOREAN WORKERS IS INCREASING.) (EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF JAPAN-KOREA UNITY. THE NUMBER OF KOREAN WORKERS IS INCREASING.) The conditions for Korean workers are worse than we imagined. It's completely different than what is reported in the news. They live collectively together. Children who should go to school are also enslaved. A lot of the children have had their fingers pinched off by machinery. Japanese managers even collect the fingers that fall on the ground. Then they play catch with the children. These damned workers are really nothing but slaves. Let's all discuss this and find a way we can help our people. Welcome! What happened? The police are on their way here. There must be an intelligence leak. Please leave quickly and hide. The Japanese police are coming! Clean it up! I'll go down and stall them. Please take care of the Princess. Comrade Kim. Hurry up! I'll take you home. Quickly! Open the door! Wait just a moment! This way! It must be this way! I'm sorry. Don't be. You're not that kind of person. I'm sorry I misunderstood you. In the future, you must continue to misunderstand. Do you hear news from Joseon? I can only read what's in the Japanese newspapers. It's impossible to read news that's really true. Starting this year, I haven't even received any news from my mother. Probably someone is intercepting her letters to me. I will check into it and see if I can help. I never dared to imagine I'd finally have someone on my side. I will rely on you from now on. Princess. We plan to help King Yeongchin flee to Shanghai. Let's go with him. Princess, you must come back. No matter what happens, you must come back. Hello. You haven't been here in a while. I'll show you to your table. I'll take it. This is General Tadao Yoshida. This one is the actual person in charge of vehicle inspection. They are our main targets at the New Era celebration. The key is having enough explosives. We must figure out a way to get those. What is the reason the King is still hesitant to flee? Because of the Queen. She can't. She is from the Emperor of Japan's bloodline. It seems the Queen... is pregnant. That was unexpected. The people in Shanghai are trying to arrange a new marriage for the King. Does that make any sense? For the sake of legitimacy of Joseon, there is no other choice. His Majesty will absolutely not go alone. Commander, there is no other way. You must go and persuade the provisional government. Okay. The uprising will surely succeed this time. The day of Joseon independence is nearly within our reach. Yes. We have a guest. He was sent by the Shanghai provisional government. Japan is far better than I had imagined. We've finally come back. Did everything go well? I want to return to Joseon. You are very much needed in Shanghai, Your Highness. I miss my mother very much. I understand. Officer, I have a favor to ask. Please go ahead. For the workers' children, I would like to set up a Korean school. After meeting those students the other day, I felt our Royal Family has no presence. In any case, I'd like to help them. Princess! Princess! Princess, you're so beautiful! You're all wrong! This one is not the Princess! She's over there! She's over there! - Princess! Princess! - Hello everyone. Princess! That isn't necessary. Please get up. They thought I was the Princess. Bok Sun, your name means you're lucky, right? Me too. Sure, take one. Thank you. How old are you? I'm 33. You're older than me. (JOSEON HANGEUL SCHOOL) Let's take a picture! Don't look so unhappy! Smile! Just count to 3 and take it. Smile! 1 - 2 - 3! "Please forgive me for entering your room without permission. Kim Jang Han" Your Highness, this letter was brought to you by Young Master Jang Han. These people actually want to stop our contact with each other. How much are you suffering while you are there? I am powerless to do anything except miss you. I hope you can quickly return and fill the void in our Royal Family. Please stay healthy. It's nice that there's still a place we can hear Joseon music. Thank you for doing this. I won't forget your help. Stay strong, Your Highness. I'll come back later. It's all right. I have prepared a special gift for Your Highness. Oh, it splashed me. "Kiss me fire!" The Princess doesn't drink. I never said that. I'll drink it. Drink it more slowly. You'll get drunk. Very tasty. Please give me another one. How about a margarita? Not too strong. Not too strong? A little stronger. A little stronger? Call me when you two decide. It's so pretty! I could die from happiness! Next time, I'll give you something new. But, isn't it a bit too small? No! It fits me perfectly! Bok Sun, could you make some porridge for me? I think I drank too much last night. Sure. Would you also call Officer Jang Han? What? What? Okay. I have important matters to discuss with the Princess, so please leave. I said leave. It's okay. You can go. Yes. What do you have to say? There was a labor uprising at Daito Industries. We need you to go there and make a speech. In front of my oppressed fellow countrymen, you want me to read this? Oppressed? They voluntarily came here. I can't do it. This was a request from the Japan royal family. Please say it clearly. By request, you mean an order. If you refuse, it will become an order. I can't do it. If you give the speech, I'll send you back to Joseon. (ROYAL CONSORT YANG IN CRITICAL CONDITION.) Princess, you can't do it. If you issue a pro-Japanese speech now, all of our previous efforts will be for nothing. This doesn't mean a step backward. Princess, don't forget you are the last pride of the Joseon Royal Family. Before I am a princess, I am the daughter of a critically ill mother. Princess. I'm tired. Leave now. In order to encourage the Joseon workers in their hard work for our great Emperor of Japan, there will be a special speech. The speech will be given by Princess Yi Deok Hye of the Joseon Royal Family. Friends and countrymen from far away, for the sake of the great Emperor of Japan, we Joseon people, in order to build a strong nation for the Emperor of Japan, we all stand at the forefront. I feel this is a very great honor. A lot of the children have had their fingers pinched off by machinery. They live collectively together. Children who should go to school are also enslaved. These damned workers are really nothing but slaves. My countrymen, I am Joseon Princess Yi Deok Hye. What is she saying? - She is speaking in Korean. - Today, I am standing here, and for all of you, I am unable to do anything at all. For that, I feel very ashamed. You all must have hope and continue to work hard. But don't forget, we still wish to return to our homeland. At this moment, we have family members waiting for us. So please don't lose hope. Please don't ever give up. We will reclaim that which has been taken from us. Arirang, Arirang, Arariyo Over Arirang Pass I long to cross today. Send us back to Joseon! Princess! Princess! Let us go back to Joseon! I'm extremely sorry! We want to return to Joseon! Soon. Just wait for a while. Please help me go home! Princess! Princess! I will take the Princess. Yes. Let's go. This way. Get out! How dare you! How dare you strike the Princess! You bastard! You son of a bitch! Why don't you go straight to hell! You crazy bitch!... - Minister. - Let go! People are watching. Princess. Are you all right? Han Taek Su is getting more and more abusive. Using protection of the Royal Family as an excuse, he has even had soldiers stationed inside the house. He doesn't suspect anything, does he? It seems he just wants to monitor the Princess. This has me worried. Uncle, how about we get rid of Han Taek Su? Who is it? Your Highness. Princess, are you not able to sleep? You don't need to worry. I heard the troops will be withdrawn soon. Bok Sun. Yes, Your Highness. I'm sorry. If not for you, I could never have endured any of this. Aigoo. Aigoo. My princess. Stay strong. I will always be by your side to protect you. Why are you together? Take her away! Yes! Let go! What do you think you're doing? I have instructions to send Bok Sun back to Joseon. Who gave you these instructions? What are you waiting for? Yes. - Don't! - Your Highness! Bok Sun! No! - Bok Sun! Bok Sun! - Your Highness! Minister Han, who gave you these instructions? - Bok Sun! - Your Highness! Control her. Bok Sun! Come here. That's enough! That's enough. Bok Sun, I will think of a way. Just go with them for now. Please stop! Please stop! Your Highness. Bok Sun! Bok Sun! Hurry and go! I want you to go. That's an order. Are you not listening to me? Your Highness. Please take care. I know. Go quickly. I promise you, if I return to Joseon, I will surely find you. Yes, Your Highness. Bok Sun. And I promise you. The day will never come that you set foot on Joseon soil again. It's Jang Han. Come in. Even if those people try to stop me, I will return to Joseon. Even if there's no one to help me, I want to see my mother. Princess, some news has come from Joseon. Is there news of Bok Sun? Royal Consort Yang has passed away. When did she pass away? I heard it was yesterday. Was anyone with her when it happened? From the old Tsushima clan, this is Count So Takeyuki. He is a graduate of Tokyo Imperial University. Their status is too different now. I had intended to find a Joseon husband for Deok Hye. I understand. Your Majesty. I am the matchmaker for the royal family. I also want to go into exile. I want to help Joseon become independent. The provisional government there will welcome you. Has my brother made a decision yet? Not yet. I'll go and persuade him. Go into exile? That's impossible. What will happen if you go? Do you think they'll give us even one penny? Is this something a Korean Royal Family member should say? A Royal Family member should not express an opinion? (PRINCE YI GEON, ELDEST SON OF KING YEONGCHIN) No matter where we go, we won't be treated as we are now! Aunt, am I wrong about this? I don't want to live like this anymore. Minister. Oh, it's you! The Princess wasn't feeling well and went to sleep early. She felt unwell? Minister, I have something to tell you. This way, please. After Japan is defeated, the Royal Family will take back their place, isn't that right? We must go. Japan is defeated? Let's just say I was never here. I used to dream of being a soldier. If Japan had come a decade earlier, I would have gone to military school. Would you like to try it on? No thanks. If I had gone to your military academy, how do you think I would have ranked? I'm sure you would have been number one. From now on, call me "hyeong." Yes. Yes. Yes. We can't let them keep using us as puppets. If we only think of our personal interests, our people will never be able to forgive us. Your Majesty, you need to go into exile. Here. The New Era Celebration will be held at the Tokyo Guild Hall. All of the targets we are fighting will be participating. When the bomb will explode at 1:00 pm, our war will begin. A bomb? Does it have to be done that way? It is to attract their attention. If at the same time that Japan's new government is attacked, you will leave into exile, the whole world will know that the Korea-Japan union was not done voluntarily. Within 6 hours after the operation begins, you will have to leave Japan. Even if they find out, searching for us after sundown will be more difficult. The Princess and the Queen, after the first base will be in disguise. At the second base in the seaside tunnel, they will transfer to the luggage truck. From the truck, they will board a cargo ship together. To ensure the security of this information, the Queen will not be told about this until the day of the operation. Will that be okay? If I told her in advance, she very likely would refuse. Once I say I'm leaving, I'm sure she will come along. The Princess is supervised very closely. You will have to reach the first base on time with the Queen. The most likely to notice change in the Royal Family would be Han Taek Su. If we must get rid of him in order to escape, doing that with the bomb will be no problem, right? Don't worry. What else am I doing here? I won't die by myself though. Don't worry. It's too bad we can't go together. You still have more important things you must do. I'll see you in Shanghai. We will definitely be successful. Long live the Korean Empire! - Long live! - Long live! He's already waiting. It's been a long time. Yes, it has. I'm very honored to meet you. I am So Takeyuki. You are taller than I expected. Thank you for freeing up some time for this. Microphone check. Microphone check. Everyone who has gone through the checkpoints, please enter. Wow! That looks great. Doesn't it? It looks very good on you. Is that so? Thank you. The ceremony will begin shortly. Please take your seats. We repeat once again. Did you have breakfast? My stomach is about to explode. What are you doing here? So you've arrived. This is one of my cousins. He said he really wanted to attend the New Era Celebration. Oh. Is that right? You must be extremely loyal to the Emperor of Japan. I've often heard my brother mention you. It will start soon. I should go. This has already been prepared. It's so pretty. I think it will look very nice on you. May I ask sister-in-law to help me? Of course. We welcome General Yoshida Tadao and... Prince Nobuyuki Watanabe. Everyone, please sit down. Go into exile? I can't believe he never told me. Where is His Majesty right now? My brother is already preparing to go into exile. Is something wrong? Yes, but it's all right. Are you feeling unwell? Just a moment. Today, the New Era Celebration begins. It's a very important day. We are here to commemorate the day on which the Emperor Showa ascended to the throne. We will now proceed to award the Golden Owl medals. We celebrate this meaningful day with the people of the whole country. We're going to be late. There's no time. The more you hesitate will put my brother in greater danger. Let us all give 3 cheers for the long life of the Emperor! Long live the Emperor of Japan! Long live! Long live! Long live! Long live! Where are my wife and Deok Hye? They're on their way. Change your clothes first. The bomb exploded. The uprising is successful. Who are you? Long live the Empire of Korea. Han Taek Su is still alive! Checkpoints have been set up all the way up the shore. You must leave quickly. We must go straight to our second base. Please leave first. Your Majesty, I will remain behind and escort the Queen and the Princess. Time is running out. Please leave quickly. Who are you? You can't go in! This is... We know the whereabouts of King Yeongchin and the Queen. Leave quickly. Was there another problem? Officer! All the roads to the seaside have been blocked. Go quickly. Please get in the car. My wife and Deok Hye have not arrived yet. We don't have time to wait for them. Are you alright? You have to leave. Your Majesty! This is your identity card. It's a forgery. Please be sure to take it with you. Only think about righteousness. This is our last chance to recover the Joseon Dynasty, Your Majesty! My wife and Deok Hye are not able to come here. I can't leave and abandon them. You must leave quickly! We're about to be surrounded! Hurry! Commander! Stop fighting. Go tell Jang Han. Close the second base. Commander. Leave here now! You should tell them you were kidnapped at the ceremony venue. In my next life, I will continue to fight for our homeland. This way! It might be the commander! I understand. Be careful. What did they say? Bok Dong, go and look for a boat. I'll meet you at noon in 2 days at the seaside base. Boat? The operation has failed. Is His Majesty safe? Yes. Princess, you may have to flee into exile by yourself. There's no time. Hurry! I'm going to stay here! Go in! Please be careful. Take care of my brother. King Yeongchin has been taken. The Queen and Princess Deok Hye are inside this building. Keep them in there. Make sure there are no other exits! This is the Queen. Where? Over here! This way! This way! Hurry! We don't see an escape path. Both of you be careful. I'll find a boat somehow. I'll see you in 2 days. Take care of yourself. The Princess, too. Please be careful. That son of a bitch. Kill them! Are you hurt? It's all right. (SHIZUOKA, INDEPENDENCE FIGHTERS BASE) Sit here. Princess, can you help me? Yes. Pour on some disinfectant. Hemostatic powder. Just hang on. Jang Han, wake up. Stay with me. How are you feeling? Wait. Let me do it. It's better if I do it. I searched around and found some potatoes. This water is very cold. Let me do it. Go back in the house and rest. I want to do it. It's very good, Princess. When it was cold here, we would all drink this together. I really feel a bit warmer. Princess, I'm sorry this has been hard for you. It's all right. I can withstand it. Tomorrow afternoon, the boat will be here. Just endure this a bit longer. (IDENTIFICATION CARD) Miyuki Fujiwara. Beautiful happiness. I hope the name I picked for you makes you happy. When we get to Shanghai, I would like to teach Korean to the Joseon children. Princess, have you ever had 5-spices pork? When we get to Shanghai, I will take you to a good restaurant. Thank you. Luckily we still have 3 potatoes left. We can give one to Bok Dong. Princess, just a moment. The sea breeze is very cold. Stop! Stay here and don't move. Take cover! Princess, from now on you'll have to go alone. Follow this path until you find the trail. Keep going down the trail until you come to the shore. At the beach you will find a place where the boat is hidden. No! I absolutely can't go alone! Let's go together! I'll cover you and then follow. No matter what happens, don't ever look back. Just keep running straight ahead. Princess, just give me 10 minutes. In 10 minutes, I'll come and find you. I will definitely protect you, understand? Go now. Stop! Let's go. Over here. Stop. It's here. Take cover! Over here! Bok Dong! Over here! Here! Princess! Princess! Hey! Hyeongnim! No! No! You can't! No! Don't! (MISSING PERSON LOOKING FOR YI DEOK HYE.) At that time, I thought you were dead. At that time, I thought you were dead. I was caught by them and sent to the South Pacific Islands as the scapegoat, and was eventually released there. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. It's all my fault that this happened to all of you. Hyeongnim, I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry, hyeongnim. Oppa! Can we have a drink? The intestine soup is really good here. Really? Welcome. I'm so hungry. The usual? Yes, right here. It's been a while. That's right. Just a moment. On May 8, 1931, following the Emperor of Japan's order, Princess Deok Hye was compelled to marry Count So Takeyuki of the Tsushima clan. The Joseon people were extremely angry upon hearing this news. At that time, one newspaper deliberately wiped the face off So Takeyuki. Eventually, Princess Deok Hye faded from people's memory. Tokyo - So Takeyuki family Eat something. I had them prepare some Korean food for you. If this goes on, she might really starve herself. To get married to a Japanese person like me... I know was against your will. But for me, you... are not a Korean person nor a Japanese person. You are only my wife. So I... will do my best for you to live happily. (SO TAKEYUKI) I'm a reporter from South Korea. We are looking for the whereabouts of Princess Deok Hye... I do not... want to be involved with any of her issues. How can you say you don't want to be involved? She was your wife, wasn't she? I will rely on you. You surely must understand. Go back. Hey! What do you think you're doing? It's all right. Stop this! What are you doing? You are the one who should stop! I will call the police. Why are you hiding her? You abandoned the princess twice! Who are... Just who are you? These are Deok Hye's things. It may be helpful to restore her memory. That was... her favorite record to play. That is our daughter, So Masae. Her Joseon name is Jeong Hye. Two years after Deok Hye and I were divorced, she committed suicide. I did abandon Deok Hye... but I... never abandoned her first. The one who left first... was her. (AUGUST 15, 1945) Jeong Hye, the maple trees at Deoksu Palace are brighter than this. Walking between the red and yellow trees, do you know how happy I felt? So I could never wait for autumn. Like this? Mom, I'm hungry. Wait just a moment. (TAKING EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES TO HELP THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE PEOPLE, ) (THE IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT DECLARES SURRENDER TO THE UNITED STATES, BRITAIN, CHINA, AND THE SOVIET UNION.) Japan has surrendered. Mom. Let's go now. Let's go home. (SHIMONOSEKI PORT) Next one, please. You may pass. Next! Why can't I? Let go of me! Let go! Let go! Shut up! Don't move! Keep in line! Is it okay if we go home? Didn't I tell you? Japan lost the war. Now we can go back to Joseon. What about Father? If the war is over, Father will also come back. From now on, you must forget about your father. From now on, you aren't part of the So family. You're a Korean named Jeong Hye. Okay? If we can return to Joseon, they should welcome us. I have waited for almost 20 years. Waiting for 20 years. Next. So Deok Hye. Your guardian, So Takeyuki, where is he? He is still in military service. What is your Joseon name? Yi Deok Hye. Are you... Princess Deok Hye? Yes, that's right. (NOT ALLOWED) Joseon will not allow you to return home. Why am I not allowed? Joseon has put your name on their rejection list. Next. Excuse me! Why am I being rejected? - I'm from Joseon! I'm Deok Hye! - Next! - But why? - What are you doing? - Wait! Wait! Wait! - Mom! Why am I being rejected? I'm from Joseon! Mom! Mom! Are you all right? Are you all right? I'm Deok Hye from Joseon. I'm Deok Hye from Joseon. I'm from Joseon. It's been a long time, Princess. This world has changed again. Joseon has unexpectedly recovered. Isn't that such wonderful news? Oh, you must be Jeong Hye. You've gotten big. Step away! Step away! Mom! Didn't I tell you this before? Princess, you will never be able to step foot in Joseon. Are you Mr. Han? Yes, my name is Taek Su Han. Please, come this way. Mom. Princess Deok Hye again attempted to return home, but at the time, the government was concerned about stability, and they refused to allow any Joseon Royalty to return home. Yang Deok Hye. She even changed her name to her mother's name. So that's why we couldn't find her. How did the Princess become like that? I guess it would be good to forget everything in your life and just live happily. Who can understand her grief? Just what exactly does royalty or homeland mean? Do you regret it? What? All that happened to you for the sake of the homeland. No. What about you? I don't either. Yes. Yang Deok Hye is here. Is that true? But without a family certificate, you won't be able to see her. She is the Joseon princess. This reporter has come all the way from South Korea to see her. May I please see her just once? I beg you. How about it? Please. Up until now, she has not had anyone come to visit her. According to our records, there have been 15 times she has tried to commit suicide. Suicide? Come in. I want to go out. Let me out of here! Let me out. Let me out! I want out of here. This is it. (6TH KOREA-JAPAN TALKS) Prime Minister Ikeda's position on the Korea-Japan economic agreement is very positive. After returning home, we will conduct specific negotiations. Please continue your questions. I am reporter Lee Jeong Oh of the People's Daily newspaper. Will detailed negotiations be carried out in the future? Of course, they must. But at this stage, we have no specifics. Due to our schedule, we can only take one more question. I am Reporter Sin Tae Yun of Dongsin News. Prior to most of the talks with the Prime Minister... Who is he? I am Kim Jang Han from Seoul News. We realize that achieving normal Korea-Japan diplomatic relations is a major issue. But first, we must restore our national pride. You know the last royal family of the Korean Empire has been abandoned in Japan. Why have they still been unable to return home? Today's press conference is only regarding the Korea-Japan economic agreement. This is both shameful and a disgrace to us. They used to be the royal family of the Korean Empire. They were abandoned while an enemy stole and ravaged this land! You can't continue to ignore this! Chairman! You did such a great thing. What's going on now? Why write this stuff about royalty? As a reporter, I only do what needs to be done. Don't you love your country? Let him go. Chairman Pak wants to see you. I heard you were a senior officer in the Imperial Army, but still involved in the independence movement. You don't want to serve in the revolutionary government? I don't support this current government. You're very cool. But, why has King Yeongchin not returned home? President Lee Seung Man who took power after the liberation, rejected requests by the Joseon royal family to return home. Chairman, the King and his family did not voluntarily go to Japan. They were forced to go. It was wrong for us to refuse to let them come home and abandon them. How do you want our government to help you? King Yeongchin and Princess Deok Hye, restore their nationality to them, and allow them to come home. Princess Deok Hye? Who is Princess Deok Hye? Welcome. How did it go? Long live! Everyone! Tonight, everything is on the house! Really? Thank you! (PATIENT: YANG DEOK HYE / GUARDIAN: KIM JANG HAN) Be careful. I'll go finish the paperwork. Please wait a moment. Yes. Princess. Princess. Do you remember me? I am Jang Han. Kim Jang Han. "Jang meaning Seal. Han meaning endurance. Kim Jang Han." "Princess, just give me 10 minutes." "In 10 minutes, I'll come and find you, understand?" No matter what happens, don't ever look back. Just keep running straight ahead. I will definitely protect you. We don't have much time! We must hurry and escape from here! That's right. We will. We will escape from here and go away. You can now return to your homeland, Princess. Why have you just come now? It's been more than 10 minutes. I have been waiting for you for such a long time. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Princess. I'm sorry that I couldn't protect you. (JANUARY 26,1962 GIMPO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, SOUTH KOREA) This way, please. Okay. Princess. You have now returned to your homeland. Agassi! Agassi! Agassi! Agassi, you have returned! Agassi! Agassi! It's been 38 years! Agassi, please receive our respects! Welcome home, Princess. Welcome! (ACCESS PROHIBITED) Princess, I'll go buy a soda for you. Please wait here for me. Agassi! Agassi! My child. You've worked hard, my child. Deok Hye. Princess. Princess. As a princess of Joseon, I have a lot inadequacies. No, Princess. No. I wasn't able to become the hope of my people. I was powerless to do anything for them. Everyone will think of me like that. At least for me, you have always given me strength. You have always been my motivation.
