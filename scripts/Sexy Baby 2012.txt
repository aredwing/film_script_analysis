WE'RE LIKE THE FIRST GENERATION TO HAVE WHAT WE HAVE. SO THERE'S NO ONE BEFORE US THAT CAN KIND OF GUIDE US. I MEAN, WE ARE THE PIONEERS. [HONKING] HELLO, AND WELCOME TO WINNIFRED'S WORDS OF WISDOM. GET READY PEOPLE, BECAUSE I'M ON A MISSION. A MISSION TO REVEAL REAL STORIES ABOUT REAL GIRLS. IF YOU AIN'T GOT NO MONEY TAKE YOUR BROKE ASS HOME G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S G-L-A-M-O...

THIS HAS BEEN WINNIFRED'S WORDS OF WISDOM. SEE YA NEXT TIME AND UNTIL THEN, PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU MAKE US DO PEOPLE. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN! [APPLAUSE] Dr. Stern: WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO YOU WHEN YOU STARTED LOOKING INTO THIS? Laura: JUST THE BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES. DO THEY TELL YOU HOW THEY WANT IT TO LOOK? AND THEN, OR. CUT IT OFF, TAKE EVERYTHING OFF. I WANT TO FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE BEDROOM. RIGHT. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE LOVE WITH THE LIGHTS ON. MAKE IT PRETTY, MAKE IT SMALLER. I WANT NOTHING HANGING. AND THEN YOU WONDER HOW SOMEONE, LIKE THAT, WAITED TILL SHE WAS 43. A LOT OF MY MALE FRIENDS JUST JOKE AROUND WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT THE GIRLS THEY'VE HOOKED UP WITH, AND THEY'LL SAY IT'S LIKE ROAST BEEF OR "SHE HAS A MEAT CURTAIN, HAHA" AND I WAS JUST LIKE LAUGHING ALONG, AND THEN I WAS LIKE OH MY GOSH, I DO, I HAVE THIS PROBLEM. Stern: LABIAPLASTIES IN YOUNG GIRLS SEEMS TO BE INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY. WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE REQUESTS. FROM TEENS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 EVEN, BECAUSE OF A HEIGHTENED SEXUAL AWARENESS, BECAUSE OF MAGAZINES, BECAUSE OF PORN, BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET. THEN MOST OF THESE AREN'T LOCAL, THEY WILL TRAVEL TO GET THIS DONE. WHAT DO YOU DO? I'M AN ASSISTANT TEACHER OF KINDERGARTEN. OH, OKAY. DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND RIGHT NOW? NO. GREAT TIME TO DO SURGERY. AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU WANTED THIS FOR? 2 YEARS. BUT IT'S BOTHERED YOU FOR LONGER THAN THAT? YES. UP HERE? EVERYWHERE. EVERYWHERE. EVERYWHERE. EVEN IN MY DREAMS. EVEN IN YOUR DREAMS. I HAVE NIGHTMARES, YES. WOW. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH, I'M GOING TO FINISH TAKING A GOOD HISTORY ON YOU, MAKE SURE THAT ALTHOUGH ALREADY WE KNOW WE'RE DOING THIS FOR THE RIGHT REASONS-- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT DOING THIS FOR YOU IS GOING TO CHANGE EVERYTHING. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE EMOTIONAL ISSUES. MY FIRST SERIOUS BOYFRIEND WATCHED X-RATED MOVIES AND STUFF, AND HE WAS LIKE "OH, IT'S BIGGER THAN MOST GIRLS, LIKE WHAT'S WRONG?" AND I JUST FEEL IT WOULD BE A HUGE TURN-ON TO A GUY TO LOOK LIKE A PORN STAR. MC: [INDISTINCT TALKING] ...EROTIC ENTERTAINER OF THE YEAR, LADIES AND GENTLEMAN WELCOME OUT NAKITA KASH! [CHEERING] Nichole: I THINK THAT THE ADULT ENTERTAINMENT WORLD HAS COMPLETELY INFILTRATED THE MAINSTREAM. MUSIC VIDEOS AND BILLBOARDS LOOK LIKE PORN. CHICKS ARE DANCING IN NIGHTCLUBS TRYING TO LOOK LIKE STRIPPERS. REGULAR GUYS ARE TRYING TO PULL PORN MOVES IN BED. AND I DO BLAME THAT ON THE DIGITAL AGE. HOLY SHIT. WOW! OH MY FUCKING GOD! [CHEERING] I WAS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I STARTED STRIPPING. I WENT FROM HOUSE DANCER TO COMPETITIVE DANCER TO MODEL. NOW ADULT ACTRESS. AND GOT REALLY, REALLY WELL KNOWN AS THE PORN STAR WHO POLE DANCED. GRAB YOUR BUTT. NICE. I STARTED POLE DANCING ALMOST A YEAR AGO. JUST TAKING LESSONS ONCE A WEEK AT ONE OF THE LOCAL GYMS. BUT TAKING THE CLASSES FROM NICHOLE, TAKING THE LESSONS FROM, YOU KNOW, A REAL EXOTIC DANCER, A REAL PORN STAR, HAS KIND OF TAUGHT ME THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS. IT'S LIKE, YEAH, I CAN DO THAT! GO IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. I WANT YOU TO GO UP. THERE YOU GO. Nichole: POLE DANCING WAS MY LIFE FOR 15 YEARS. AND ONCE THE MAINSTREAM WORLD STARTED SHOWING INTEREST IN WHAT NAKITA KASH WAS REALLY GOOD AT, I WAS ABLE TO HAVE NICHOLE SHOW THEM WHAT NAKITA KASH HAS LEARNED. AND I FIND WOMEN WANTING TO BE LIKE NAKITA KASH, BUT NICHOLE JUST WANTS TO BE LIKE THEM. NICE, MELISSA! [MUSIC PLAYS] ONE, TWO, THREE. WHEE! JUST HAVE YOUR MOM CALL ME OR CONTACT ME SO I CAN FIND OUT. YEP. Ken: I HAVE FRIENDS WHO LIVE IN THE SUBURBS AND FRIENDS WHO LIVE IN OTHER CITIES, AND THERE'S LIKE THIS STEREOTYPE OF A NEW YORK CITY KID. [DOG BARKING] PEOPLE SAY "WOW, WINNIFRED. SHE'S NOT SHELTERED, SHE'S EXPOSED TO THE CITY." Winnifred: COME ON INTERNET! I GUESS I DO WORRY, BUT I WOULD SAY MOST KIDS GET EXPOSED WHEREVER YOU LIVE. Winnifred: OKAY SO THESE ARE ALL PHOTOS THAT I TAGGED OF MYSELF OR PEOPLE TAGGED OF ME. Ken: WINNIFRED IS A STRONG GYMNAST, SHE'S A WRITER, SHE IS AN ACTOR. SHE'S INTO SOCIAL JUSTICE. SHE KNOWS ABOUT ISSUES IN THE WORLD. I MEAN, SO FAR, SO GOOD. PERSONALLY, I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT MUCH. I MEAN, I KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE, BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN IT. I MEAN, I'M THINKING BACK TO WHEN I WAS A KID, MAYBE NOT 12 BUT DEFINITELY 13, LIKE KIDS HAD ACCESS TO DIRTY MAGAZINES. DAD, THAT'S SO OLD SCHOOL! SO, IF NOW YOU'RE ON THE INTERNET, WHY WOULDN'T A KID YOUR AGE LOOK AT SOMETHING ONLINE? IT'S DIFFERENT, DAD. WHAT STOPS KIDS YOU THINK? JUDGMENT! VERY LITTLE KIDS HAVE IT. I KNOW BUT I'M SAYING, RIGHT. I HAVE IT! OH, SNAP. SSSSS! NEED SOME OINTMENT FOR THAT BURN? I'M KIDDING, DAD, I'M KIDDING. Nichole: YEAH, YOU BIG BABY GIRL. SHHH. WHAT'S FUNNY IS THEY ACT LIKE THEY HATE ME. THEN AFTERWARDS THEY RUB UP AGAINST ME LIKE "THANKS MOM!" WHEN I WAS ON AMERICA'S GOT TALENT... AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME? MY NAME'S NICHOLE. ...I GOT A STANDING OVATION FROM A CROWD OF PEOPLE WHO ALL DAY LONG HAD BEEN BOOING PEOPLE OFF OF THE STAGE. [CHEERING] IT WAS A PRETTY COOL EXPERIENCE. YOU'RE GOING TO VEGAS. YES! BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I DIDN'T GO ON NATIONAL TV AS NAKITA BECAUSE MY FAMILY WAS GONNA WATCH. GOOD BOY. YEAH, I LOVE YOU. SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOUR SISTERS. COMING TO FLORIDA I GUESS MAYBE WAS THE FIRST STEP OF PULLING BACK THE NAKITA KASH LAYERS. THERE'S HAIR EVERYWHERE. GETTING BACK TO MY TRUE SELF. I THINK MY FAMILY ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BE AN ARTIST. OR AT LEAST AN ENTREPRENEUR. BUT AT LEAST THEY WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK, I'M A PERFORMANCE ARTIST. I'M CREATIVE. MY MOM HAS A LOT OF PICTURES OF ME DRESSING UP IN MY DANCE COSTUMES. I ACTUALLY WISH SHE WOULD HAVE ENCOURAGED ME MORE, AND BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT ME MORE IN MY DANCE. WHO KNOWS WHAT LIFE WOULD HAVE ENTAILED. AND WHO KNOWS, I MIGHT BE IN A THEATER INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PERFORM DANCE IN ANOTHER WAY. I'M REVEALING MY COOKING SECRETS. ESPECIALLY BEING IN THE INDUSTRY, I DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IN MONOGAMY. I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MARRIAGE. UM, I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW ONE PERSON COULD KEEP YOU HAPPY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. AND, I DON'T KNOW, I MET DAVE. THE WHOLE WORLD CHANGED. CAN YOU COME HERE PLEASE? I CAN'T REACH THE THING. THE OTHER ONE. IT'S WAY BACK THERE. EVEN THOUGH DAVE WORKS IN THE ADULT INDUSTRY, HE TALKS TO PORN STARS EVERY DAY, HE BECAME VERY AWARE THAT HE COULD SEPARATE IT. HE COULD GO HOME AT THE END OF THE DAY AND JUST BE A NORMAL PERSON. AND I FIND, I FIND MYSELF EVERY DAY LEARNING WHO NICHOLE IS AGAIN. WATCH THIS, THIS IS HOT! NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. [SIREN WAILS] Man: LET'S WELCOME OUR PANEL. HOST OF FOX NEWS' REDEYE, BILL SHULZ. STATE ATTORNEYS JENNIFER BONJEAN AND JENNIFER SMETTERS. LET'S FIRE UP THE CLOCK. JENNIFER BONJEAN, THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME IS AREN'T COURTS... YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO-- THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS SORT OF THING, NOT THE PRESIDENT. IT'S LAWYERS WORKING IN COURTS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THESE JUDGMENTS. YES, BUT THEY CAN'T DO THE SWEEPING POLICY CHANGES THAT THE JUDGE DOES, THAT THE PRESIDENT DOES. LISTEN... WAIT A MINUTE, THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED CONGRESS. IT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP HIM DO THAT. THAT'S TRUE, BUT HE CAN PUT HIS INFLUENCE, HIS SWAY ON THIS, AS JENNIFER SAID. AND NOT ONLY THAT, IT'S THE ANTI-REGULATORY APPROACH OF THE LAST ADMINISTRATION... Girl: MOMMY! WE SAW YOU ON TV! OH MY GOD, WE RAN OUT OF FROSTING! [LAUGHING] HAPPY B-DA! I ALWAYS SAY I'M EITHER BEING A LOUSY MOTHER OR A LOUSY LAWYER. I'M NEVER REALLY OUTSTANDING AT BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. DADDY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR WINNIFRED CHA-CHA-CHA! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! CHA-CHA-CHA! ALL RIGHT. MAKE A WISH! DAD, WANNA SEE MY BAT-MITZVAH SHOES? Winnifred: WANT ME TO GET THE DRESS? SHE WANTS TO WEAR FISHNETS WITH IT. WE'LL SEE. "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, WINNIFRED. "WHILE YOU ARE GROWING INTO A BEAUTIFUL, INDEPENDENT, "THINKING YOUNG WOMAN, WHO YOUR MOM AND I ARE BOTH SO PROUD OF "IN SO MANY WAYS, AT THE SAME TIME, "YOU REALLY ARE STILL A KID. YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MY NUMBER ONE." HAPPY B-DA! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! OH MY GOD -- WAIT. YOU GOT LADY GAGA TICKETS! YOU CAN GO WITH WHOEVER YOU WANT TO GO WITH. OH, MY GOD. DAD. Jeni : THESE GIRLS, AND BOYS THEY'RE GETTING THE SAME MESSAGES AND INFLUENCES ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. AND YOU CAN EITHER BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION, BE PART OF THEIR THINKING, OR YOU CAN LET THEM FIGURE IT OUT ON THEIR OWN. AND I SORT OF WOULD RATHER BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND BE PART OF THE THINKING. I GET BLOWN OFF A LOT, BUT I DO THINK IT REGISTERS SOMEWHERE. LOOKS GOOD, THAT'S PERFECT. THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU. ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE? OW! SORRY. DON'T POKE. LOOK! SHOW YOUR SISTERS HOW PRETTY YOU LOOK. YOU DO LOOK REALLY PRETTY. YEAH, DOESN'T SHE LOOK PRETTY? RIGHT HERE, C'MON DOVE. OH MY GOD, DUDE! DID YOU WEAR THE TEAL ONES? YEAH, OH, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE OVER THERE. OKAY, STEVE. STEVE, THESE ARE AISLES. THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK. SHEMA YISRAEL ADONAI, ELOHEINU ADONAI ECHAD AS THE GREAT POET GIBRAN SAYS "TO SOAR AND TO FLY, YOU NEED A STABLE BOW". AND WHAT COULD BE MORE CONSISTENTLY STABLE FOR YOU, WINNIFRED, THAN A COMBINATION OF MOM AND I. RIGHT? I'M GONNA CHEAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I'M GOING TO READ TO HER THIS WRITING THAT COMES FROM EVE ENSLER, WHO IS A HERO OF MINE AND WHO I KNOW IS A HERO OF WINNIFRED'S. I AM AN EMOTIONAL CREATURE. UM..."HERE'S WHAT YOU WILL BE TOLD. "FIND A MAN, SEEK PROTECTION, "DON'T CARE SO MUCH, DON'T TRAVEL ALONE, "YOU ARE NOTHING WITHOUT A MAN. "HERE'S WHAT I'M TELLING YOU. "EVERYONE'S MAKING EVERYTHING UP. "THERE IS NO ONE IN CHARGE EXCEPT FOR THOSE WHO PRETEND TO BE. "SAY NO WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING, "SAY YES IF YOUR INSTINCTS ARE STRONG, "EVEN IF EVERYONE AROUND YOU DISAGREES. "TAKE YOUR TIME. "MOVE AS FAST AS YOU DO, AS LONG AS IT'S YOUR SPEED..." I'M SORRY. AT LEAST IN MY HOUSE, AND WHAT I HOPE TO ROLE MODEL FOR MY DAUGHTER IS THAT YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR SEXUALITY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, KICKING ASS AND DOING IMPORTANT THINGS AND ALWAYS BEING IN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS... AND UM, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? AND VALUING BEING TREATED WELL. [APPLAUSE] MC: WHO'S GOT BETTER MOVES, MOTHER OR DAUGHTER? SO LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, AS YOU CAN SEE, IN THE CENTER OF THE DANCE FLOOR, WE HAVE WINNIE VS. JENI. CHECK IT OUT, MOTHER VS. DAUGHTER. LET'S GO! SOMEBODY CLAP YOUR HANDS, JUST CLAP YOUR HANDS! I THINK WINNIE IS WINNING. WHAT YOU GOT JENI? C'MON, "DAMN YOU'S A SEXY CHICK"! Laura: FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE EVERYBODY SAID THAT I SHOULD BE A MODEL BECAUSE OF MY HEIGHT, OBVIOUSLY. I DO HAVE A FAVORITE. IT'S A BLACK AND WHITE ONE WHERE I'M LIKE SITTING ON A BED AND I'M HOLDING MY HAIR UP. IT'S JUST, IT'S VERY SIMPLE I THINK, BUT STILL SEXY AND RELAXED. I THINK THE MODELING HERE IN CHARLOTTE, IT JUST WAS VERY SHADY SO I REALIZED THAT I NEEDED TO FIND SOMETHING WITH ACTUAL SUBSTANCE TO IT, AND BE A LITTLE BIT MORE RESPONSIBLE. TWO IS BIRCH. MY JOB NOW, I TEACH KINDERGARTEN IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. I'M AN ASSISTANT TEACHER. AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE UP SO THAT I COULD AFFORD SURGERY EARLIER, BUT I DID GET A SECOND JOB NOW AND I'M PLANNING ON SAVING UP ALL THE MONEY THAT I CAN TO PUT TOWARDS THIS. [READING INDISTINCTLY] Ken: I THINK I'M AS MUCH AS A FEMINIST AS, YOU KNOW, A MAN CAN BE. I HAVE 3 DAUGHTERS AND I WANT THEM TO GROW UP TO BE STRONG, POWERFUL ADULTS, SO I PAY ATTENTION TO THE GAZILLION DIFFERENT INFLUENCES THAT COULD HURT THAT. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE. WHEN GOGO WAS 5, WE HAD THIS BOOK CALLED CINDEREDNA, WHERE THERE'S LIKE CINDERELLA AND CINDEREDNA. AND CINDERELLA IS A BLONDE, BEAUTIFUL BARBIE DOLL, AND CINDEREDNA IS LIKE COOL, INTERESTING. SHE HAS HOBBIES AND INTERESTS, SHE HAS A GARDEN, SHE'S INTO SCIENCE. AND SO I SAY TO GOGO, LIKE YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME READING THIS BOOK TO HER, SO WHAT'D YOU THINK? LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHO DO YOU LIKE BETTER? AND SHE'S LIKE "CINDERELLA, OF COURSE." I GO "YOU LIKE CINDERELLA?" SHE'S LIKE "YEAH!" I GO "WHY?" SHE GOES "SHE WAS PRETTY." THAT'S, IT--IT'S EVERYWHERE. YOU CAN'T AVOID IT, SO I LIE TO MY KIDS A LOT. I TELL GOGO "IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE." AND AT SOME POINT THEY REALIZE YOU'RE LYING TO THEM, BUT HOPEFULLY INSTEAD OF BECOMING, LIKE 80% OF WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT, IT'S LIKE 32%. DO YOU HAVE HER CHARTS? MY PRACTICE IS LIMITED TO FEMALE COSMETIC GENITAL SURGERY. I OPERATE ON 5 PATIENTS A DAY. Woman: THE FIRST BUNNY IS A GIRL BUNNY. SEE THE PRETTY EYELASHES? SHOULD WE MAKE THIS ONE A GIRL BUNNY? Stern: AND THE MOTHER, MOST OFTEN THE MOTHER AND THE DAUGHTER DO COME IN TOGETHER. COME ON BACK. GET UNDRESSED FROM THE WAIST DOWN, HAVE A SEAT ON THE TABLE. OKAY. SCOOT DOWN TOWARDS ME. SLIDE BACK A LITTLE MORE, THERE YOU GO. ON A SCALE OF 1 to 10, 10 BEING THE ENORMOUS ONES, YOUR RIGHT ONE'S A 7, YOUR LEFT ONE'S AN 8. SO THIS ISN'T IN YOUR HEAD. OKAY? IF I GET THOSE WINGS OFF COMPLETELY AND ROUND THEM TO THE SIDE, IS THAT GONNA MAKE YOU HAPPY? YES! OKAY. C'MON. WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS. NO, THIS IS-- I'M ALREADY LOVING IT. NO, BECAUSE THIS IS... YOU REALLY-- NOBODY NEEDS IT, BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY A GREAT CANDIDATE, 'CAUSE I MEAN, THESE ARE BIG. HOW MANY BUNNY RABBITS DID YOU MAKE TODAY? UM, 5? RIGHT HERE? NO, YES, YES, THIS WAY. ARE YOU STILL FEELING EXCITED AND HAPPY ABOUT THIS? I'M SO EXCITED. ARE YOU? YEAH. WHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED LABIAPLASTY, AND I TOLD MY MOM AND MY BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME. THEY WERE BOTH KIND OF LIKE "YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT, YOU'RE PERFECT THE WAY YOU ARE." BUT I FEEL THAT I ALREADY HAVE THIS IMAGE IN MY HEAD OF WHAT A LABIA SHOULD LOOK LIKE AND THERE'S NOT REALLY ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT NOW. IT'S LIKE A PERMANENT SCAR IN MY MIND. NOW MORE WOMEN ARE HAVING A VERY CONTROVERSIAL PLASTIC SURGERY DONE ON THEIR MOST PRIVATE AREAS. I LIKE A LONG HAIR THICK RED... I DON'T KNOW, HOW'S IT GO? "OPEN UP HER LEGS, BIG RED THONG, OPEN UP HER LEGS THAT FILET MIGNON." THAT PUSSY, I'M A GET IN AND ON THAT PUSSY YEAH, IT'S LIKE THE LIPS, IT'S THE OPENING. IT'S THE HELLO. GON' THROW IT BACK... THAT'S HOW WE KNOW ANATOMY, FROM HIP-HOP. I'D BE REALLY CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE AVERAGE LABIA IS LIKE. I MEAN, THAT WOULD PROBABLY MAKE ME START THINKING LIKE "AAH, WHAT IS THE PERFECT LABIA?" I DON'T WANNA EXPLAIN ON VIDEO CAMERA WHAT ROAST BEEF CURTAINS ARE. OH MY GOD! I NEED THAT SURGERY! Nichole: WOMEN ARE MUCH MORE AWARE OF WHAT THEIR VAGINAS LOOK LIKE BECAUSE OF PORN. I THINK THAT THE VERY FIRST LABIA REDUCTION THAT WAS POPULAR WAS PROBABLY THE PORN STAR BY THE NAME OF HOUSTON. IN FACT SHE MADE A HUGE DEAL OUT OF IT. SHE WAS A VERY BIG PORN STAR AND SHE AUCTIONED HER TRIMMED LABIA OFF ON EBAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, SOME AUCTION WEBSITE. SO I WILL CALL YOU TOMORROW AS SOON AS I HEAR FROM HER ABOUT THE HBO TAPES. [INDISTINCT TALKING] WOULD YOU PREFER THAT WEEKEND AND WE'LL JUST SAY YES AND DO IT NOW? [Phone beeps] HI HUN, IT'S NAKITA. I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH BASE WITH YOU TODAY. GIVE ME A CALL BACK, I'M IN THE OFFICE. THANKS. MY FIRST MAGAZINE I EVER SAW WAS UNDER MY DAD'S MATTRESS, AND BACK THEN, I MEAN, THERE WAS NO PENETRATION. NO PENETRATION IN A NUDIE MAGAZINE? NO. WOW. THE FIRST UH, THE FIRST PENETRATION EVER WAS IN A PENTHOUSE ISSUE WHEN I WAS WORKING IN LAUDERDALE, IN '97, '98. NOWADAYS, UH, THE LIMITS ARE PUSHED A LOT FURTHER. THERE'S, UH, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I CAN SAY, BUT ANAL, DOUBLE ANAL, DOUBLE PENETRATION, CREAM PIES. I MEAN THERE'S THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING IN MOVIES NOW THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT 10, 15 YEARS AGO. I WOULD ASSUME A LOT, KIDS ARE HAVING SEX A LOT YOUNGER NOW. IT'S IN THEIR FACE A LOT MORE. IT'S JUST MORE ACCESSIBLE, SHOWING THEM WHAT TO DO AND-- AND SHOWING THEM MORE THAT IT'S OKAY NOW BECAUSE IT IS SO MAINSTREAM. DO YOU THINK THAT IF, WHEN WE HAVE-- IF WE HAVE A SON AND HE BECOMES 12 YEARS OLD... WHEN WE HAVE A SON AND HE TURNS 12, WHAT? WHEN WE HAVE A SON AND HE TURNS 12, DO YOU THINK THAT THIS MUCH PORN AND SEX BEING IN YOUR FACE AT THAT AGE IS HEALTHY? I DON'T WANT TO ANSWER THAT. I DON'T LIKE THAT QUESTION. WHEN I SAW PORN FOR THE FIRST TIME? I DON'T KNOW. I WAS PROBABLY IN LIKE MIDDLE SCHOOL. YEAH LIKE 12 OR 13. LIKE MY FIRST ENCOUNTER SEEING SEX WAS LIKE THE MOST DIRTIEST, LIKE CRAZY SHIT EVER. SO IT PROBABLY PERVERTED MY MIND A LITTLE. LIKE, I MEAN I'M A GOOD GUY AT HEART, BUT I DO LIKE TO LOOK FOR, YOU KNOW, CERTAIN FEATURES OF A GIRL TO BE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO SOMETIMES PORN STARS. EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET THAT BIG BOOB, BIG ASS, PORN STAR THAT EVERYBODY SEES, YOU KNOW LIKE... WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK YOU DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT IT, YOU PICTURE THAT IN YOUR MIND. IT CHANGES THE WAY THAT PEOPLE HAVE SEX, IT DOES. 3 GUYS HAVING SEX WITH YOU AT THE SAME TIME, LIKE, HOW DO YOU DO THAT? UH, I DON'T KNOW, SOME OF IT IS JUST REALLY...DEGRADING. I THINK ABOUT IT TOO, IF I HAD NEVER LIKE, LOOKED AT ANY OF THAT, I WONDER IF ANYTHING WOULD HAVE CHANGED WHO I AM RIGHT NOW. BIBI, YOU WANNA GO TO THE...PARK? DO YOU WANNA GO TO THE PARK? [BARKING] OKAY. PORN IS FOR ADULTS. IT'S NOT MADE FOR TEENAGERS TO LEARN ABOUT SEX. A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT GUYS DO ON CAMERA IN PORN IS FOR THE CAMERA, BECAUSE IT LOOKS GOOD VISUALLY, AND DOESN'T NECESSARILY FEEL GOOD. FOR HIM OR THE GIRL. A LOT OF THE SPITTING AND THE SQUIRTING AND THE CUM GUZZLING AND SNOWBALLING AND THE THIS AND THE THAT, I MEAN, IT MIGHT GET SOME GIRLS OFF, BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY'RE DOING THAT FOR PAY. WHAT'S SNOWBALLING? [LAUGHS] SORRY. I'M PIMPIN'. THREE, TWO, ONE. OW! I WOULD NEVER EVEN THINK OF WEARING REAL FUR. SMELLS LIKE MY GRANDMA. MINE, TOO. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I FEEL LIKE ONE OF THOSE REBELLIOUS PEOPLE. DANIELLE, WE ALSO HAVE TO WALK THE DOG! [SINGING INDISTINCTLY] IF I HAD TO SAY HOW MANY GUYS HAD PORN APPS ON THEIR PHONE, I WOULD GUESS 8 OUT OF 10. BUT I'D GUESS FOR GIRLS IT'D BE LIKE 5 OUT OF 10. IS THAT COOL TO WATCH PEOPLE, LIKE, HAVE SEX? FURIOUSLY? I LOOKED ON THE SCREEN AND IT WAS THIS ONE BLACK GUY, ONE HISPANIC GUY AND THIS ONE VERY BLONDE WOMAN. AND UM, THEY WERE OUT ON A LAWN AND THEY WERE JUST LIKE, FEROCIOUSLY... BANGING EACH OTHER. IT WAS VERY...MMM. I MEAN I CAME HOME, I WAS BAWLING MY EYES OUT. I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. I GUESS I'M THE KIND OF PERSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE GUTS AND DOESN'T REALLY CARE ENOUGH TO LOOK AT PORN AND STUFF. I KNOW WHAT SEX IS, I DON'T NEED TO SEE IT IN FRONT OF ME PLAYED OUT. I DON'T REALLY CARE. WANNA SPEND IT ALL ON YOU BABY MY ROOM IS THE G-SPOT, CALL ME MR. FLINTSTONE I CAN MAKE YOUR BED ROCK I CAN MAKE YOUR BED ROCK GIRL I CAN MAKE YOUR BED ROCK I CAN MAKE YOUR BED ROCK I NEVER HAD MORE SEX IN MY LIFE THAN I DID WHEN I FIRST MET MY HUSBAND. NEVER. IT WAS CONSTANT, NONSTOP FRICKIN' NAKITA KASH SEX. UM, I HAD TO PROVE MYSELF. HE FELT THAT HE HAD TO PROVE HIMSELF BECAUSE I WAS A PORN STAR. WHICH IN GENERAL, THAT'S, THAT'S WHAT PORN SEX IS, IT'S SPORT FUCKING. IT'S YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND OF POSITIONS CAN I GET MYSELF IN, AND HOW HARD AND FAST CAN I GO, AND HOW LOUD AND CRAZY CAN I GO. IT'S DEFINITELY NOT MAKING LOVE. THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE. MAKING LOVE IS THE KIND OF SEX THAT YOU WANNA CRY AFTERWARDS, JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL, AND SO EMOTIONAL, AND SO POWERFUL. THAT'S LOVE SEX. AW, A FRENCH BULLDOG. I LOVE FRENCHIES. ALRIGHT, I GUESS WE HAVE TO GO THE OTHER WAY. ALRIGHT MUNCHKIN, YOU READY TO DO THIS? IT WON'T LAST LONG. BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY. C'MON! THE FIRST FEW TIMES DAVE AND I MADE LOVE WAS A MILLION AND A HALF TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY SPORT FUCKING COULD EVER BE. C'MON, LETS GO TO THE BEACH! DON'T GET ME WRONG, WE STILL HAVE OUR SPORT FUCKING SESSIONS. BUT IN GENERAL LATELY SEX HAS BEEN GET-TO-THE-POINT. PURPOSEFUL SEX IN TERMS OF LET'S MAKE A BABY. DAVE IS 40, I'M 33, HE'S IN A HURRY, AND I'M IN A HURRY FOR HIM. DON'T KNOW, LOOKS A LITTLE WEIRD. YEAH. OKAY, SO...SO TO SHOW YOU WHAT PEOPLE USUALLY WEAR TO THIS LADY GAGA, THIS IS. HOLY CRAP! YEAH, AND LADY GAGA TALKED TO HER. SHE SAID, "OH LOOK HOW CUTE WITH THE CAUTION TAPE!" SO, YEAH. WE GOTTA DRESS UP! JUST DANCE BUT HE... IS THIS SLUTTY? THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S A GOOD LENGTH. IT'S SHORT LIKE IN A COOL WAY, NOT LIKE A SLUTTY WAY. FRENCH KISSED ON A SUBWAY TRAIN HE TORE MY CLOTHES RIGHT OFF HE ATE MY HEART AND THEN HE ATE MY BRAIN HE'S A MONSTER ARE YOU WEARING HEELS? FUCKING A, I CAN'T WEAR THESE. OH, OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, THEY LOOK RETARDED WITH THESE TIGHTS. AND SECOND OF ALL, THEY'D BE TOTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE. LIKE, I'M ALREADY BORDERING ON INAPPROPRIATE, SO... THIS SHIRT, NO THIS SKIRT, ACTUALLY MAKES ME LOOK LIKE I HAVE A BUTT! WHICH IS GOOD! BECAUSE I HAVE NONE. Ken: YEAH, SO WE'RE BASICALLY HERE . UM, I'M KIND OF NERVOUS. I'M SO FRICKIN' EXCITED! WOULD YOU RATHER BE OVERDRESSED OR UNDERDRESSED? OVER. WINNIFRED. YES? WHEN YOU GET INSIDE THE CONCERT, GO TO YOUR SEAT. WHEN YOU FIND YOUR SEAT, CALL ME. ALRIGHT? YOU LISTENING? THIS IS GONNA BE... OH MY GOD, LOOK AT EVERYONE. LOOK AT EVERYONE! AND YOU THINK THAT WE'RE UNDERDRESSED! A LOT OF THE FEMINIST LITERATURE AND STUFF I READ WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, IF I READ IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, OR JUST REVISITING IT NOW THAT I HAVE A 13-YEAR-OLD IN TODAY'S CULTURE, IT'S LIKE A WHOLE 'NOTHER LAYER. AND I LIKE LADY GAGA. BUT I AM A LITTLE TORN THAT SHE'S JUST SORT OF DISGUISING THE SORT OF TYPICAL SEXUALIZATION, OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN IN SOMETHING MORE COMPLICATED OR DEEP. CAUSE YOU WERE BORN THIS WAY BABY BUT SHE REFLECTS THE CULTURE OF TODAY, AND IT'S A HIGHLY SEXUALIZED ONE. YOU KNOW THAT I WANT YOU CAUSE I'M A FREE BITCH BABY! BUT AT LEAST SHE OWNS IT. SHE'S IN CONTROL OF IT. WANT YOUR BAD ROMANCE! I GOT GIRLS ON MY RIGHT, I GOT GIRLS ON MY LEFT AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER IMAGES AND MESSAGES WHERE GIRLS ARE JUST OBJECTS. I JUST WANT TO UNBUTTON YOUR BLOUSE AND LET THE GIRLS OUT I WANNA FUCK YOU PORN HAS CHANGED TO WOMEN BEING OBJECTS. NOW THAT IT'S MORE ACCEPTABLE, WOMEN IN THE WORLD I BELIEVE ARE SEEING THAT THAT'S THEIR ROLE IN SEX. SOME GUY WAS LIKE "YEAH FLASH THE CAMERA!" AND EVERYONE'S CHANTING, "DO IT, DO IT!" AND PEOPLE ARE PUSHING ME FORWARD TOWARDS THE CAMERA, THE CAMERA'S SHINING ON ME AND I'M LIKE, "I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT." I THINK THE GIRLS GONE WILD PHENOMENON IS EXTREMELY DEGRADING. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAKING CHARGE OF YOUR SEXUALITY AND SAYING "I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING," INSTEAD OF HIM SAYING, "LET ME SEE, LET ME SEE, LET ME SEE." [MC TALKING INDISTINCTLY] I WAS IN CHARGE OF MY SEXUALITY BY INVITING MY ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL TO COME WATCH ME DO AN AMATEUR CONTEST. MY VERY FIRST TIME STRIPPING ON STAGE I WAS NAKED IN FRONT OF MY ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I DID WIN THE CONTEST. BUT I'VE ALWAYS, IN DANCING, IN PORN, IN EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE, CONTROL IS MY MAIN THING. HIS HANDS! I DON'T MIND DOING A LAP DANCE FOR YOU, YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS WHERE I TELL YOU TO KEEP YOUR HANDS. YOU DON'T MOVE. I TURN YOU ON. PERIOD. MY WAY. THAT'S JUST HOW IT WORKS. THE WHOLE USING YOUR SEXUALITY AS POWER AND EMBRACING IT, AND FEELING LIKE IF I WANNA DRESS IN A PARTICULAR WAY I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE JUDGED AND I'M DOWN WITH THAT, I DO IT MYSELF. I WEAR FISHNETS IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS, MANY-A-TIMES. BUT IT'S SORT OF SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DEVELOP AFTER YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT REALLY MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING IN WAYS THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO SOCIETY. CHANGING YOUR LIFE AND CHANGING OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES. MOMMY! MOMMY! CAN YOU COME HERE? I HAVE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. SO WHAT ROLE DO YOU HAVE IN THE MOCK TRIAL? WE'RE GONNA BE LAWYERS. I TOLD THEM EVEN THOUGH THE PROSECUTOR CASE IS GONNA BE SO MUCH EASIER, BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS WIN EVERY YEAR, I WAS LIKE "MY MOM'S GOING TO BE SO PISSED "IF I END UP BEING A PROSECUTOR "SO I SUGGEST YOU SAVE YOURSELF AND MAKE ME A DEFENSE ATTORNEY." I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE ISSUE, MAYBE I WOULD SAY, LET'S SEE, THIS IS THE ISSUE... IT'S ABOUT FINDING THE BALANCE, AND IT'S HARD. I MEAN IT'S HARD TO FIND IT AT 40, LET ALONE AT 13. Winnifred: "A SCANNER ERROR HAS OCCURRED, TURN POWER OFF AND TURN ON AGAIN." WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PHOTOCOPYING MY BUTT, LIKE BRITNEY SPEARS. DADDY-O, YOU GOT THE SWAGGER OF A CHAMPION TOO BAD FOR YOU YOU JUST CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT COMPANION C'MON. WHOA. I GUESS WHEN YOU HAVE ONE TOO... DAD, CAN I TALK TO YOU PLEASE? NO! NO! DAD! IT'S OKAY. WHAT IF, WHAT IF, DAD, CAN I GO TO SCHOOL AGAIN EARLY? THAT FELT GOOD. I FELT ACCOMPLISHED. I LIKE THAT METHODOLOGY. BECAUSE I FEEL ACCOMPLISHED TOO, YOU KNOW WHY? IT ACTUALLY FORCES ME TO GET UP, TOO. IT'S GOOD. AND YOU GET A FREE CAB RIDE. OH, MY GOD. DAD. I'VE HAD LIKE 6 CAB DRIVERS AND LIKE 3 OF THEM HAVE NOT MADE ME PAY, OKAY? SWEAR TO GOD. HE DIDN'T MAKE ME PAY! ACTUALLY HE DIDN'T MAKE ME GIVE HIM A TIP. IS IT LIKE "OH, YOU'RE A NICE GIRL, I'M SORRY YOU HAVE TO GO BY YOURSELF TO SCHOOL". NO, I JUST BLOW THEM. EXCUSE ME? I'M KIDDING, I'M KIDDING. I'M KIDDING, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS! THAT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY. GET OFF OF ME. [INDISTINCT]. DAD! WHAT? THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE. HOLY SHIT! WHAT THE F IS THAT? OH MY GOD, IT'S BLOOD, I HAD MY PERIOD! [MAKING PHONE NOISES] "MOM, CALL ME BACK, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. IT'S AN EMERGENCY. DAD, I NEED A MINUTE!" (HEAVY BREATHING) STUFFING TOILET PAPER IN UNDERWEAR. "OKAY, I'M COMING!" AND SCENE. ARE YOU WEARING MY BRA? THIS IS NOT YOUR BRA. THE BIO-FIT. THIS IS MY BRA. LET ME SEE THIS. OH, IT'S YOURS. [RINGING] WHO IS IT? CAN YOU LEAVE? CAN YOU PLEASE LEAVE? I'M VIDEO CHATTING WITH SOMEONE! GO! HE CANCELLED--HE CANCELLED THE INVITATION! GOD I HATE YOU. WHY ARE YOU HIDING STUFF FROM ME? BECAUSE YOU'RE SO WEIRD, MOM! [LAUGHTER AND INDISTINCT TALKING] GO AWAY! OKAY, OKAY, ACCEPT, ACCEPT. HI. WHAT? Boy: MY SISTER JUST CAME TO MY COMPUTER AND LIKE, LOOKED THROUGH ALL MY STUFF. THAT'S WEIRD. [EXHALES] ALRIGHT, I HAVE TO GO SHOWER, BUT I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. ALRIGHT, BYE. BYE. MY GOD! THAT WAS LIKE THE MOST AWKWARD THING EVER! I NEED TO HOOKUP WITH SOMEBODY. I DON'T WANT TO DATE THEM, I JUST WANT TO STICK MY TONGUE IN THEIR MOUTH. THAT WAS GRAPHIC, SORRY. IT HAPPENS, IT HAPPENS OVERNIGHT. THE INTERESTS COMPLETELY CHANGE. THEY ISOLATE THEMSELVES MORE FROM YOU. I DON'T KNOW, IT'S AGE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN BEING COGNIZANT OF THE OPPOSITE SEX. SO, LET'S SAY, LIKE, I'M TALKING TO A REALLY HOT GUY, AND I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET WITH HIM, AND I KNOW HE'S STALKING ME ON FACEBOOK. I'D PROBABLY DO THIS ONE. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. IT'S LIKE, SEDUCTIVE. SO BASICALLY, LIKE, THERE WAS THIS REALLY HOT GUY THAT WE WERE LIKE HOOKING UP. AND LIKE, I SNUCK OUT TO SEE HIM AND LIKE, I LIKE, COULDN'T REALLY, LIKE, SEE HIM THAT MUCH. AND LIKE, I REALLY WANTED TO BE LIKE, CLOSE TO HIM, SO I JUST LIKE SENT HIM, LIKE, A PHOTO. AND THEN HE LIKE, PUT IT ON FACEBOOK AND I GUESS A COUPLE PEOPLE SAW, LIKE, MY BRA. BOOBS LIKE OUT--NOT LIKE OUT, BUT THERE WAS LIKE, A BRA, AND IT WAS LIKE A SEXY BRA. AND THEN I WAS LIKE OR SOMETHING. I FORGET. BUT IT WAS JUST LIKE, I FELT KIND OF DIRTY AFTERWARDS BECAUSE I JUST FELT LIKE MISCONCEIVED FOR 2 MINUTES ON HIS WALL. EVERY GIRL WANTS TO FEEL, LIKE, SEXY. AND I FEEL LIKE A GUY TELLING YOU THAT, LIKE, JUST MAKES YOUR DAY, LIKE, MAKES YOU FEEL REALLY GOOD. LIKE MEGAN FOX, EVERY GIRL WANTS TO BE HER. VAGINA, CLITORIS, UTERUS AND MORE, BY SCARLETEEN, SEX ED. FOR THE REAL WORLD. RAWR! YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE GETTING PLASTIC SURGERY ON THEIR VAGINAS? WAIT, ACTUALLY? YEAH, WOMEN THINK THAT THEIR VAGINAS ARE TOO DROOPY AND STUFF. WHAT THE FUCK, I DON'T NEED TO SEE THE CLITORAL... GO TO "LABIAPLASTY." THIS IS THE SURGERY. BEFORE AND AFTER! BEFORE AND AFTER PHOTOS, DR. BENSON IN TEXAS. OH, SHE DEFINITELY NEEDED SOME LABIA SURGERY! SO THE DOCTOR IS GOING TO CALL YOU AND LET YOU KNOW WHAT TIME YOU'RE SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW? YES. I HOPE HE CALLS YOU TONIGHT. I GUESS I'M KIND OF IN THE DARK, MOM. IT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT MY MOM AND I HAD EVER DISCUSSED. AND THEN SO I WAS LIKE, WOW, KIDS ARE REALLY MORE UNINHIBITED NOWADAYS. AND I GUESS I DIDN'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE. BUT SHE DIDN'T LET UP, SHE CONTINUED FOR LIKE 2 YEARS! I FEEL ALREADY, JUST KNOWING THAT I'M GETTING IT, I ALREADY FEEL HAPPIER, AND LIKE, MORE MOTIVATED TO DO THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. I FEEL MORE OUTGOING AND JUST ALL AROUND HAPPIER. GOOD! SHE'S AN ADULT NOW, AND IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHE FEELS WILL ENHANCE HER LIFE, IMPROVE HER LIFE, I WANT HER TO BE HAPPY. DON'T CRY. WHY ARE YOU CRYING? I DON'T KNOW. SHE WAS MY LITTLE BUDDY. SHE WOULD GO WITH ME ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE. SHE'D PLAY WITH HER BARBIES AND HER BABIES AND STUFF LIKE THAT. WE WERE VERY, I THOUGHT, VERY, VERY CLOSE. THEN YOU GOT INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL. (LAUGHING) I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF GROWING UP. I GET NOSTALGIC, THEN I START LOOKING THROUGH PICTURES OF MYSELF, WHEN MY PARENTS USED TO LOVE ME. AND THEN I CRY BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT THE WAY I USED TO BE AND I'M NOT, LIKE, INTERESTING ANYMORE. CAN I PLEASE GO WITH MY FRIENDS ON FRIDAY? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MISS GYMNASTICS SO YOU CAN GO TO A MOVIE. WAIT, WHY? DO YOU KNOW HOW HORRIBLE IT IS FOR ME TO DO GYMNASTICS? YOU KNOW I HATE GYMNASTICS? OKAY, QUIT. WE DO BATTLE ABOUT NEXT YEAR, WHETHER SHE'S GOING TO CONTINUE WITH IT. AND I'VE HAD A LITTLE PEEK INTO WHAT SHE DOES WHEN SHE HAS MORE TIME ON HER HANDS. AND IT'S, IT'S NOT PRETTY. IT SCARES THE BEJESUS OUT OF ME, ACTUALLY. LIKE, MY MOM PUTS SO MUCH PRESSURE ON ME TO LIKE, WRITE AND WRITE POETRY. AND I LIKE DOING THAT STUFF, BUT I WISH I LIKED IT MORE. I DON'T KNOW, I JUST WANT HER TO BE LIKE, PROUD OF ME. I MEAN, THERE'S STUFF THAT I KNOW CORRUPTS ME. THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T WANT TO HAVE IT. LIKE FACEBOOK. I MEAN, FACEBOOK IS LITERALLY LIKE 30% MY LIFE. AND IT SHOULDN'T BE. THERE'S A PICTURE OF ME IN MY BRA ON FACEBOOK. IT'S STILL UP THERE. IT'S ON OLIVIA'S PAGE -- LIV. I'M NOT GONNA DO IT AGAIN, I PROMISE YOU! I'VE NEVER-- NOPE. NO. I'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE. NO YOU HAVEN'T! OH, YEAH, I HAVE. I, I, I MEAN IT! I MEAN IT, PLEASE. YOU'RE NOT GETTING FACEBOOK BACK RIGHT NOW. NO. CAN I HAVE FACEBOOK BACK? Ken on phone: UM, NO. IF YOU SAW YOUR KID SHNARFFING DOWN A BAG OF POTATO CHIPS, YOU'D SAY "HEY, NO MORE POTATO CHIPS!" FACEBOOK'S NO DIFFERENT REALLY, BUT IT'S JUST HARDER, IT'S HARDER TO LEGISLATE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE COMPUTERS, THEY HAVE PHONES, AND THEY CAN GET ON IT WITHOUT YOU KNOWING. TEACH ME HOW TO DOUGIE ALL THE BITCHES LOVE ME Woman: WHOO! ALL MY BITCHES LOVE ME, ALL--ALL MY BITCHES LOVE ME ALL MY BITCHES LOVE ME, YOU FUCKING WITH MY DOUGIE? THE WAY I SEE SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS ENCOURAGE MYRTLE, TO ME THAT IS ON THE BORDER OF EXPLOITATION. YOU MADE ME DEACTIVATE MY FACEBOOK. BECAUSE OF THAT? WHAT ELSE? GUESS WHAT I GET TO DO NOW ALL DAY? GYMNASTICS. YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT AWAY, TOO. IT'S LIKE HORRIBLE, FACEBOOK IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE AND I CAN'T HAVE IT! LOST IN THE WORLD, FETAL AND CURLED, AND NO WAY OUT. LIGHTS OUT. COLD. OH MY GOD, THIS IS LIKE, HORRIBLE. I NEED SOCIAL NETWORKING! WHEN I FIRST STARTED TELLING MY STUDENTS WHO HAVE KIDS, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE PLAN OF KIDS AND IT'LL HAPPEN WHEN IT HAPPENS, ALL OF MY STUDENTS, FOR SOME REASON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAS TOLD ME TO DO ACUPUNCTURE. THERE WAS ONE AROUND HERE THAT I REALLY FELT. AT FIRST, AND THEN-- I AM SCARED THAT I CAN'T HAVE A BABY. I TRIED FOR MANY YEARS. I'VE HAD A MISCARRIAGE. ALRIGHT, THAT'S IT. I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE NEXT LEVEL OF MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY HUSBAND. AND I AM SCARED THAT IF WE CAN'T REACH THAT NEXT LEVEL, WHERE OUR RELATIONSHIP IS GONNA GO. AW MAN. IT SAYS, UM, "I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN THOUGH THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST WILL SPEND ALL OF HIS OR HER TIME DURING THE SURGICAL PROCEDURE ENSURING MY SAFETY, ANESTHESIA DOES BARE SOME RISK OF A POSSIBLE, POSSIBILITY OF EITHER INJURY, ALLERGIC REACTIONS OR RARELY DEATH. I GUESS THEY'RE COVERING ALL THEIR BASES. THIS REMINDS ME OF WHEN I WENT WITH HEATHER FOR HER TO GET HER BREAST IMPLANTS. DID YOU GO WITH HER? MMM-HMM. THAT WAS A GOOD FRIEND. DID SHE HAVE TO SIGN STUFF LIKE THAT TOO? THESE ARE COOL SHOES. ARE THOSE LITTLE SHELLS? JUST A LITTLE DESIGN. ARE YOU CRYING AGAIN? YEAH, I'M JUST, I'M JUST-- I SHOULD BE THE ONE CRYING. I'M JUST NERVOUS FOR YOU. DON'T CRY, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME NERVOUS! READY, CAROL? [MONITORS BEEPING] THERE IS A PERFECT-SIZED PIECE, JUST LIKE IN HER PICTURE. I HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG GIRLS THAT'LL CONTACT ME THAT'LL SAY "I HATE 'EM, I'M GOING TO CUT THEM OFF!" AND I SAY "MAKE SURE YOU'RE NEAR A HOSPITAL, BECAUSE THEY CAN REALLY BLEED." (GROANING AND CRYING) THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE A KID? PROBABLY NOT. WORSE? NO. NO? NO. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL. WANT ME TO SIT THERE NOW? YEAH, GO. THAT LITTLE GIRL IS SO FRIGGIN' ADORABLE. Dave: NO OFFENSE TO HER, BUT WE DIDN'T MARRY EACH OTHER JUST TO BE TOGETHER. NO. IT WAS TO BUILD AND DEVELOP A FAMILY. SO WE GOTTA GET ON THAT. THAT WAS A STIPULATION OF GETTING MARRIED-- DO YOU WANT KIDS? IF I HAD SAID NO... WE WOULDN'T BE MARRIED. WE WOULDN'T BE TOGETHER. IT'S PART OF THE PACKAGE. YEP. I DON'T LIKE CLICHES. I CAN'T STAND CLICHES, BUT WHEN IT'S MEANT TO BE, IT'LL HAPPEN. I HAVE 458 FRIENDS. YOU HAVE LIKE 12. OPEN UP. STOP. IF I DRANK ALL OF THIS, WOULD I DIE? NO, WINNIFRED. STOP IT. I'M JUST ASKING. THAT'S LIKE 2 SHOTS. YES, YOU WILL DIE, BECAUSE I WILL KILL YOU. THAT WAS GOOD! YOU LIKE THAT? (LAUGHING) THAT WAS GOOD. WINNIFRED. YEAH? THERE ARE SO MANY COOL THINGS IN YOUR HOUSE. I WANNA GO DO A PHOTO SHOOT. CAN WE PLEASE DO A PHOTO SHOOT RIGHT NOW? C'MON LIV, PHOTO SHOOT! AH! I LOVE YOU. THAT IS SO PRETTY, OH MY GOD. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. I LOVE YOU, TOO. I SAID I DIDN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THE PICTURES YOU ENDED UP POSTING, I'M PRETTY CERTAIN-- YOU DID BEFORE I POSTED THEM. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GETTING POSTED! HUH? BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TRUST ME! YOU WERE DOING A PHOTO SHOOT WITH OLIVIA. I'VE SEEN THAT GIRL'S PHOTOS. OKAY, BUT THAT'S NOT ME! YOU DON'T TRUST ME TO LIKE, MONITOR MYSELF? LISTEN, WHEN YOU'RE A PARENT, YOU THINK YOU KNOW YOUR KIDS, BUT EVENTUALLY YOU GET TO THE AGE WHERE YOU'RE KIND OF SHUT OUT OF THEIR PRIVATE LIVES TO SOME DEGREE, AND THEY HAVE SOME PRIVACY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH THAT YOU'RE MAKING GOOD DECISIONS, BUT WE DON'T KNOW WITH 100% CERTAINTY-- JUST BECAUSE I'M HANGING OUT WITH OLIVIA, DOESN'T MEAN THAT SHE HAS ANY CONTROL OVER ME. WELL, I KNOW THAT. AND I DO TRUST YOU. BUT YOU TOTALLY DIDN'T BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT. YOU TEXTED DAD THIS LONG-ASS THING ABOUT HOW I'M LIKE, YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ANY SLUTTY PHOTOS... YOUR FACEBOOK PROFILE IS NOT NECESSARILY WHO YOU ARE. IT'S MORE LIKE WHO YOU WANT TO BE. WE MAKE OURSELVES SEEM LIKE WE'RE DOWN TO FUCK. WE MAKE OURSELVES SEEM LIKE WE'RE UP FOR ANYTHING. AND LIKE, IN A WAY, ALL OF THIS INTERNET STUFF KIND OF TRAPS YOU. YOU'VE STARTED AN ALTER EGO THAT HAS TO BE MAINTAINED, AND HAS TO BE REAL IN A WAY. SO YEAH, IT DOES KIND OF SHAPE HOW YOU END UP, AND HOW YOU ACTUALLY ARE IN REAL LIFE. YAY! YAY. TAKE A LITTLE BREAK? TAKE A BREAK? OKAY. Nichole: I THINK DAVE THOUGHT FOR AWHILE THAT HE WAS BEING PUNISHED FOR ALL THE BAD THINGS THAT HE DID IN HIS LIFE. I KNEW HE HAD GIVEN UP. THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY. IT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT. I WAS LIKE "CRAP, I DIDN'T GET MY PERIOD." DAVE WAS LIKE... WOO HOO, JUST KIDDING. SO WE WAITED 3 MONTHS. UNTIL WE WERE OUT OF THE FIRST TRIMESTER. 3 MONTHS BEFORE TELLING ANYONE. LITERALLY, RIGHT AFTER WE HEARD THE HEART BEAT, HE WAS ON THE PHONE WITH HIS MOM. OH YEAH. IT WAS GOOD STUFF. HE CRIED. SHUT UP. YOU CRIED. SHUT UP. YOU CRIED. DID NOT. YOU CRIED. I LOVE YOU. I'VE ALWAYS CARED DEEPLY FOR EVERY PERSON IN MY FAMILY. BUT I HAD THAT WALL BUILT UP SO THAT I COULD KEEP THEM AT A SAFE DISTANCE SO THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE JUDGMENT OR THE DISAPPOINTMENT. WHEN DAVE CAME INTO MY LIFE, A LOT OF THAT WALL WAS BROKEN DOWN. ALRIGHT, YOU GUYS READY FOR THE COOL STUFF? WE'RE GONNA GO INTO 3-D. DUDE. THAT'S SO COOL! HERE, WE'LL DO THIS. AW! BABY ROCCO! I LOVE THAT NAME. MY CHILDREN ARE NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED A COMPUTER IN THEIR OWN ROOM. IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE LIVING ROOM WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE WATCHING. I CAN'T AS, YOU KNOW, A FORMER ADULT FILM STAR TELL MY CHILDREN THAT SEEING EXTREME PORN ON THE INTERNET IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. JUST THOSE CAN'T BE YOUR FIRST EXPERIENCES. YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT A LITTLE BIT SLOWER THAN THAT. Woman: ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU LATER. Winnifred: I WAS SO GOOD, I DIDN'T GET IN TROUBLE LIKE ONE TIME. UM, YOU CAME HOME WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE A HICKEY ON YOUR NECK! WHICH OF THESE SCRAGGILY LITTLE BOYS IS IT? AS LONG AS YOU DIDN'T INHALE WINNIFRED, IT'S OKAY. OH MY GOD, YOU'RE SO FULL OF CRAP. GLAD TO SEE THERE WAS ALL TYPES OF INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT GOING ON ON THIS SCHOOL TRIP. OH TRUST ME, YOU HAVE NO IDEA. WAIT. THANK YOU! OF COURSE, THERE YOU GO. YOU'RE THE STAR, OKAY? THANK YOU! WHO WAS THAT? SOME RANDOM GUY. LOOK AT THE GARDEN, THERE'S BEAN SPROUTS! SHE'S NOT INTERESTED IN BEAN SPROUTS ANYMORE. NO REALLY, MOM! I'M INTERESTED. I'M NOT DRESSED LIKE A HO BAG, OKAY? I'M KIDDING. LISTEN HONEY, IT'S YOUR BODY, YOU CAN DRESS THE WAY YOU WANT TO. THAT SMELLS REALLY GOOD. CAN I WEAR THAT? YEAH. DID YOU NOTICE THAT I COLORED MY HAIR? NOW THAT YOU POINTED IT OUT. NOBODY HAS NOTICED. BUT IT'S BLACK NOW. I'M COMPLETELY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS OF THE SURGERY. I THINK THAT MY SEX LIFE WILL BE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. I UM...IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET, BUT I'M ANXIOUS FOR IT, AND I FEEL EXCITED TO JUST SHOW OFF MY BODY NOW. "YOU HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER. "I WILL BE INDEBTED TO YOU FOREVER. "I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW "HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR CLIPPING MY WINGS. "I LOVE MY NEW LIPS. "ON BEHALF OF WOMEN I'LL NEVER KNOW, THANK YOU FOR IMPROVING THEIR LIVES." I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE I'VE CURED CANCER. "SHE CHECKS HER FACEBOOK PAGE. EVA'S PIC IN THE SHORTS APPEARS ALONG WITH A COMMENT." ANYBODY CARE TO READ MATT'S COMMENT? I'LL READ IT. OOH, YEAH. OKAY, OKAY, GOT IT, GOT IT. "DAYUM, LOOKIN' HOT AS HELL, SEXY. NO WONDER OLD DUDE HIT ON YOUR ASS. SEE YOU TONIGHT?" SHE ADDS A COMMENT OF HER OWN. "THAT'S MY GIRL. YOU'RE SO FUCKING HOT, "I'M ABOUT TO PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE, BITCH. STOP BEING SO DAMN SEXY. LOL. LOVE YA." THAT IS VERY GOOD. IT'S AMAZING, IT'S SO SIMPLE AND YET VERY POWERFUL. AND IT SHINES A DIFFERENT LIGHT ON IT, LIKE HOW YOU WERE ALL SAYING BEFORE. WATCHING THIS PLAY OUT, IT MAKES YOU REALIZE MAYBE HOW YOU'RE BETRAYING YOURSELF SOMETIMES IN YOUR ACTIONS. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? THIS GIRL'S NOT FINDING REAL VALUE IN WHO SHE IS. ALRIGHT, EVERYONE'S DONE. THAT WAS LIKE... THIS WAS THE BEST WORK YOU'VE DONE SO FAR. EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT. WILL YOU PLEASE KEEP PRACTICING. [BARKING] WHY ARE YOU FREAKING OUT, BEATRICE? I WANNA TALK ABOUT THE WAY YOU DRESS. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY? I'M WORRIED ABOUT IT. WHY DO YOU WEAR SHIRTS THAT SHOW YOUR BOOBS? I DON'T WEAR SHIRTS THAT SHOW MY BOOBS. WHY DO YOU WEAR SHIRTS THAT LIKE, YOU CAN SEE THE SIDE... THE SIDES OF MY BRA? YES. BECAUSE I THINK I LIKE THE SIDES OF MY BRA, AND I LIKE LOOKING AT IT. SO YOU DO IT FOR YOURSELF, OR IS IT LIKE-- IT'S NOT LIKE A SEXY WAY TO DRESS. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRESSING LIKE A WHORE AND DRESSING THE WAY I DRESS. THE WAY I DRESS, IT'S MORE STYLE-BASED. SO YOU'RE NOT DRESSING BECAUSE YOU WANT BOYS TO BE ATTRACTED TO YOU OR THINK THAT YOU'RE, LIKE, SEXY? THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT? BUT YOU UNDERSTAND THE WAY YOU DRESS... WELL AT LEAST I DON'T ACT LIKE A WHORE. MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THAT VS. HOW I DRESS. [DOG BARKING] OKAY. SEE, THIS IS NOT THAT BAD. OF COURSE JUST BECAUSE YOU DRESS IN A SEXY, PROVOCATIVE WAY, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE DOING THOSE THINGS. I GET THAT. UM, IT'S TRICKY, YOU KNOW? SO...I DON'T KNOW. I'M LOOKING AT YOU WITH A MIXTURE OF STRESS, ANXIETY, HORROR AND REALITY CHECK. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL THOUGH. THANK YOU. SO, YEAH. Winnifred: I THINK THIS IS THE SAME WITH EVERY TEENAGER. YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SO MANY CHANGES THAT LIKE, IT'S SO FREAKING CONFUSING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU WANT TO PORTRAY YOURSELF. AND THERE'S A LOT OF GIRLS JUST EXPLOITING THEMSELVES TO BE AND PUTTING THEMSELVES OUT THERE TO BE JUDGED BY GUYS AND OTHER GIRLS. BUT, AT A CERTAIN POINT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BECOME A PROP IN SOME GUY'S LIFE, YOU HAVE TO FIND A GOAL AND A PATH. AND I DO WANT TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND... AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT BY BEING SEXY. I'LL COME PICK YOU UP IF YOU DON'T HAVE A RIDE. ALRIGHT? ALRIGHT. IS THAT OLIVIA? LIV! Dave: THIS IS OUR LITTLE ROCCO. THIS IS MY PRIDE AND JOY! HI DADDY! YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE MOMMY'S FAVORITE NO MORE.
