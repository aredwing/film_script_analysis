So you're saying this whole thing is one big conspiracy? - Do you mean you are the victim? - Not exactly, no. Not like... Not like whom, Mr Stevens? Not like her, you mean? Where were you this morning, Mr Stevens? I asked you where you were this morning. At home. - My wife and kids are on holiday. - Not anymore. She's on her way here. She'll have a few questions of her own, I'll bet. So you were called out of bed this morning. At what time exactly? It must have been around half past ten. It was Rob. He kept shouting I had to come over, that something very bad had happened. - Robert Hartman? - Robert, yes. - Where was he calling from? - The loft. I had to come right away. Did he say what the panic was about? Did you know why? Not at that time, no. Rob? Jesus, man. What's wrong? - What happened here? - I don't know. I walked in and there she was. What are you going to do? Don't touch anything. Wait for the cops to get here. - Did you call the cops? - No, but aren't we supposed to? No one's calling the cops just yet, okay? Christ, what a mess. - Do the others know? - Willem and Bart are on the way. ...but I couldn't reach Tom. - They need to come right away. - All of them. - Who is she? Do you know? - Matt, do you know who that is? - No, of course not. - How did they get in to begin with? - I don't know. The door was locked and the alarm was off. - Impossible. - I swear. - The door was locked but no alarm. - No. That means that someone... Yes, I know. Someone must have used one of our keys to get in. Do you know the property next to the DSM site? No, I don't. Your good friend Matthias Stevens is the contractor. He owns a big firm, many projects. There's a loft on the top floor of that building. - That doesn't ring a bell? - No, it doesn't. That's odd. We have information that you and your friends share that loft. In secret. Behind your wives' backs. - That's ridiculous. - You really think so? You never take anyone up there? No girlfriend or mistress? Five friends who need some privacy for their sordid little affairs. No hotel bills to hide from your wife. - That's just ridiculous. - I'd advise you not to play dumb. One of your friends has spilled the beans. Don't you want to know who it was? I don't cheat on my wife. What happened to your eye? - I ran into a cupboard. - Did you get into a fight? - I told you, I ran into a cupboard. - Where were you this morning? Bart and I had breakfast. We've got witnesses. Bart Venneker, the psychologist. The friend you share that little sex pad with. Bart is married with two children and he's not the cheating type. We've got a big problem, Bart. Oh my god, Tommy... What was that, Bart? Did you say 'Tommy'? You think your brother's involved? Jesus Christ, I don't know what to think right now. - This is fucked up. - Shit. - We've got to call the cops. - Just a minute here. You know what happens if we call them. Think, man. - Do you want your wife to find out? - There's no other choice. Think for a minute. If Matthias is right... If Tom is involved we have to turn him over to the cops. He's the first one you thought of too? Have you forgotten about last time? - No. - We're both thinking the same thing. Come on. We'll help him, of course. You know that, we're friends. - If he explains, maybe we can... - What? Dump the body? I won't have scum like him ruin my marriage. Will you? Willem, do you know if Tom was here last night? No, I don't. - What are you doing? - I want to see her face. Don't touch her. Leave her alone, Bart. Jesus, man. Who is it? Tell us who it is. I don't know. None of us have anything to do with this, right? Right? We have to find out what happened here and then we deal with it. Okay? We're keeping this quiet. We're all friends here. Alright? Go right in and enjoy yourselves. - Hey, how are you? - Hi there, Matt. - What do you think? - Not bad at all. Look what the cat dragged in. How did you make it past security? - Well done. - Thanks. Glad you could make it. - Hi there, Eva. - Hello. - You look fantastic as usual. - Thank you. - What a building. - The perfect apartment by the water. - I don't think we can afford it. - On your salary? If you say so. Why don't you get a drink. We'll see you in a minute. - Matthias Stevens. - Nathalie. Looks great. - Let's not stay too long, okay? - Honey, we just got here. You're right. Have you seen the skirts in this place? Check out the black bird. Annette. Caught in the act. - You're at it again, aren't you? - Just checking out the crowd, honey. - You behave or I'm leaving you here. - Promises, promises you never keep. - Where's Marjolein? - She's checking her sugar levels. - There she is. How are you feeling? - Fine. I had to... I'm fine now. Go home if you have to, cookie. She just measured her sugar level and you call her cookie. So he loves his wife. What would you do if that were me? If you were I'd be more than happy to inject your ass every day. Can I ask you something, mister psychologist? - Of course. - You are Dr Venneker, aren't you? - That's right. - You knew my sister. She was a patient of yours. Sophie Marai. I was sorry to hear what happened. Well, some people are just born unhappy, I suppose. I still don't get it. We'd been making big strides recently. That last leap forward wasn't exactly a success. Ten floors. You didn't buy an apartment here by any chance? Excuse me? No, I didn't. The architect is a friend of mine. - And you? - Who, me? No. I'm here with alderman Roijers. I'm his personal assistant. - Interesting. - Not really, no. I'm Ann. Ann Marai. - I'm sorry about your sister. - Don't worry about it. - It runs in the family, I'm afraid. - You do lots of stupid things? All the time. You see, I have a tendency to fall for the wrong guy. Tom, there you are. - Not your first party tonight, is it? - No. Let me introduce you to two friends of mine. This is, uhm... Oh, whatever... This is, uhm... Can I borrow this guy for a minute? A quick kiss. Step over here. - A short family meeting. - Big brother's going to lecture me. Hello, Barty. - Kimmy's friends or are we babysitting? - The marriage is still a month away. You know I love Kimmy but how can I pass up on all this candy? - Good to see you guys. - Where are Willem and Rob? I've got something to show you. Just follow me, gentlemen. The lift is impressive but I thought we were here to see the loft. - Just a minute, we're almost there. - Watch it, you idiot. That wasn't funny. - So gentlemen, what do you think? - Nice. It's lovely. When it's decorated this will be a haven of peace. Quiet, by the water, city view. Your haven needs a bit of work, though. You can come here whenever you like, with whomever you like. Just imagine... wouldn't it be fantastic to have such a place? Your own cubbyhole, where you can... steal time, as it were? - Steal time? - Do you think I should sell it? - Would you like to keep it yourself? - With a few friends maybe. - To do what? - Those girls in their skirts... Are they... No, they're not coming up here, are they? Why don't you give me the keys so I can show Tom's lady friends around. Those birds are pretty expensive, you know. - You have to pay them? - Why would we rent a loft here? - I think you know what I mean. - I do and I'm not like that. You know that. Neither is Rob, for that matter. Aren't we all like that, really? Or don't we all want to be like that? If you say so... You can read a pretty thick newspaper here, you know, Bart. Come on, let's get out of here. Have a beer, Rob. I have to get out. I can't do this. I can't stay here. Where are you going? Stay here, prick. We're in this shit together and we're taking care of it together. Easy, man. Let's not freak out. We have to keep our cool. It's over, Matt. Can't you see that? We can't keep this a secret. That's where you're wrong. We're going to handle this, okay? Let's stay focused here. Tom's voicemail, leave a message. What if he doesn't show? He has to and he will. - What if it's just like last time? - We can't protect him forever. What the fuck is this, guys? Fatum nos iungebit. - What does that mean, Bart? - It means... Do you know Latin, mister psychologist? Do you know Latin? - Yes, I do. - Great. Tell us what that means. - Fatum nos iungebit. - I can read. What does it mean? Fate will link us. Fate or, in this case, death. Written in her blood, no less. We've found that the victim is not exactly the type that knows Latin. So it's quite possible someone wrote that with her finger. Someone who does speak Latin, mister psychologist. - Fatum nos iungebit is wrong. - What do you mean? The present future tense of iungere is not iungebit but iunget. So it should read Fatum nos iunget. The person you're looking for made a classic mistake. But I'm guessing you knew that already. Didn't you, detective? Mr Venneker, where is your brother? We can't seem to find him anywhere. I have no idea where he is. I really don't. I'm sorry. He's actually your half-brother, isn't he? Same mother... Youth spent in institutions with his sister. - He didn't have the best dad. - Apparently. A severe alcoholic who routinely beat his children. You never had much contact and all of a sudden you're the best of friends. That's right. We have a lot of catching up to do. What does that mean? Fate will link us. Is that for us, Bart? Hey, guys... - It's one of ours. - Just what we need. - Where the hell is Tom? - Where do you think? - Can anyone tell me what happened? - You sadist motherfucker. - Cut it out, Rob. - Touch me again and you're dead. Cool it. Calm down now, okay? Simmer down. - Do you know anything about this? - No. I've got nothing to do with it. It's okay. You can count on us. We'll find you a good lawyer. I don't need a lawyer. - Were you here last night? - No, I wasn't. I spent the night at my in-laws. What took you so long? I was at a construction site with my father-in-law. I couldn't just leave. Great voicemail message too: 'There's a stiff in the loft. ' - I don't get it. - Care to tell me where you were? Before you start accusing people, where were you? - I was at home last night. - Any witnesses? What, you don't believe me? No, there were no witnesses. - Nathalie's in Nice with the kids. - Please, guys. If one of us is involved, this is the time to say so. This is the time to fess up. It's now or never. Another one bites the dust. I'll drink to that. - Is the fat guy the father-in-law? - Anton de Nijs, aka daddy Concrete. Building projects all over the world, loaded and that's his only daughter. That teller machine in Tom's ass must hurt like hell. - He looks very happy. - And there's his partner in crime. He's been building like mad since Roijers became alderman. - Roijers, wasn't he at your opening? - He was just networking. The gravy train has its own architects, I'm afraid. So you can't play with the big boys? How sad. I've just about had it with their type. Here you are, gentlemen. This is my present. Are you serious? There are only five copies so don't lose them. If you accept this key, you also accept the rules of the loft. Willem? Our wives are here, remember? - Exciting, isn't it? - A bit. The loft is finished. Check it out. It's my gift to all of you. You're not like that, are you, Bart? Save it for later. Who knows, it might come in handy. Robby. Just make sure it doesn't blow up in your face. Guys, our very own loft. And now to find a date, Willem. No lack of birds here. Say what you want but these guys have taste. Young chicks, too. See the one in the purple dress over there? - I'd love to show her a good time. - She could be your daughter. She's eighteen. Touch her and I'll kill you. - She's yours, is she? Sorry, dude. - That's Linda. - Is that Linda? Lazy-eye Linda? - What? - It's Linda. - Is that your baby sister? She filled out nicely. That little flower is ripe for the picking. More than ripe. Shut the fuck up. Excuse me, boys. They say the seed of a friend can't hurt, right? - I'm thirsty. What do you say we... - Get a beer. Don't ever talk about my sister that way. Lay one finger on her and I'll rip your balls out. I was just having a laugh, you lunatic. - Hi there. - Hi. - Do you remember who I am? - I do, as a matter of fact. You're Ann. Ann Marai. You do remember me. That's nice. You work weekends as well now? - The alderman will be very pleased. - He can go to hell. You're a bit more than a simple assistant, aren't you? I told you I have a tendency to fall for the wrong guy. Shall I let you in on a secret? But it stays between us, okay? Do you know what gets the good alderman off? He likes to put my panties in his pocket at events like these. He gets off on knowing that when he spots me in the crowd... ...he's the only one who knows I'm naked underneath. Be careful. Make sure you don't catch cold. Bart, I'm sorry. I have no idea why I do stuff like this. - I have a tendency to shock men. - I don't shock that easily. We should have a normal conservation sometime. Over coffee perhaps? I would like that. Matt, that key of yours... Perhaps I'd like to use it after all. It's not what you think. I'll give it back as soon as I can. Trust me, Bart, it's never what I think. Have fun! Just a quick check, guys. Does everyone still have their key? - Of course we still have our keys. - Let's think this through. There are five keys. You need a code to make a copy. That code is in my safe, so you can't make a copy. There was no break-in so just to be sure: does everyone have his key? You think we're handing those keys out? Isn't that against your rules? - Let's see those keys. - And prove what? Maybe someone's lost his key. Come on, guys. Here's mine. Where's your key, Bart? - You didn't use your key to get in. - I didn't bring my key. - Lost your key, Barty boy? - I didn't bring it. I don't need it every day, like you do. But you still have it, right? Whether or not I brought my key is irrelevant. Irrelevant? I only see four keys and where's the fifth? - Someone used one of those keys. - And why was the alarm off? That tells me that whoever used that key also knew the alarm code. You're right, unless... I'm such an idiot. Of course. She must have let him in. Oh really? And how did she get in? Whichever way you look at it, it always comes back to us. I'd like to know which one of us is hiding something here. Sorry, I don't get it. He was cheating in the Efteling? In the Efteling hotel. He took her to the Efteling hotel. - Why there of all places? - To fool around, I guess. I know that, dear, but why not take her somewhere nice? If you're going to fool around... - Don't do it in Mother Hulda's well. - Are we in the Efteling again? You know that girl said she really wanted to go to the Efteling. She wanted to play with Long Neck. - She was very young, you know. - You mean like twelve? Just young, that's all. Around Kimmy's age. Sorry? Look, the cheating thing... it all depends on how you go about it. You do it right or you do it right, or not, uhm... Or you do it... No, no, wait. You could take her somewhere like, say... Walibi. - Walibi? - Sure. I admit it's easy and cheap. ...but you can also... Listen, you can also take her to... No, get this: To the Museum of Jewish History. You feel the difference, don't you? You just need the right approach. - Annette, I've made a bit of a mess. - Bart, can you hand him a wet rag? We'll do the dishes later, honey. Why don't you join us? The fun went out of the evening long ago. - They're still our friends. - Your friends, and you were late. - You could at least get home on time. - You know what my job is like. Should I also pay you by the hour to get some attention? Quit sulking, will you? It's not as if we have them over every week, is it? Come on and join us, okay? - Please... - Okay then. I only hope Willem won't puke his guts out again. An affair sounds great but it's so much trouble. You're right. There's the kids, work and family... we're always tired. And who wants to send texts from the bathroom at night? - What about your boss and that girl? - They're living together now. She's 22 and blonde with fake tits. - I wonder why men like fake tits. - Women! Always whining about fake tits. Look, she's got fake tits. So what? If it's done right they look great. My mother has false teeth. When she smiles, people don't say: Oh my god, she's got false teeth. No, people actually tell her those false teeth look great. They think it's an improvement. Women are just jealous, that's all. A gorgeous chick is a gorgeous chick, fake tits or no fake tits. Can I get you another drink, Willem? The topic is too profound for my small intellect, I'm afraid. Perhaps you should have your brain enlarged then. You might want to get the corners of your mouth lifted as well. Who knows, it might help you smile. Anyway, you should use your head and that's all I'm going to say about it. - What do you mean, 'use your head'? - Could be anything. Right boys? Thingies, stuff... Or keys. Dear Willem, it looks like you've got a keen interest in the subject. Are you telling me you don't? You devil, you. - Are you feeling alright, Willem? - Have another drink. - Or why don't you just go home? - Okay, but what home do you mean? - That's the question. - You have several? - 'We' have several, yes. - What do you mean: we? I mean 'we' in the sense of 'us, men', of course. In Holland there's a loft, in Holland there's a loft. This is embarrassing. A glass of water, perhaps? - It's okay. He's had one too many. - And it happens slightly too often. Why can't he be more like you? - I'm sorry. - No worries. I felt a bit queasy after that starter. Thai food... - It gave you a runny nose, did it? - No. What? No. We're almost out of insulin. Is there something you need to tell me? What do you mean? - Are you keeping secrets from me? - Of course not. I know my illness has been making life difficult lately. For both of us. - You're talking crazy. - Is there someone else you like? Where are all these funny questions coming from? - I'm not cheating. - That's not what I asked. Cookie, I may be somewhat boring compared to the others. ...but I'll always be there for you and for the children. I couldn't live without you. I want you to know I could really take a lot... I'm sorry. - What are you doing? - I want her out of here. Can't you see she's tied to the bedpost? Don't you see what's going on here? We're being set up. - Isn't that obvious? - Who would set us up? Think for a minute. There's a dead body handcuffed to the bed. The Latin saying... And the knife. All of it right here in our loft. Someone's gotten wind of our little deal. There's no other explanation. Did anyone spill the beans? Willem, how about you? - No, why me? - Dunno, when you were drunk maybe? I always followed the rules. You've never given anyone the code? No one's ever seen you key it in? - Don't look at me guys. - What are you saying? Maybe someone wants to get even by making sure this gets out. - Who would want to get even? - No idea, Tom. A jealous boyfriend, a rejected mistress... Something like that. Are any of you in trouble? You're sweet. Sweet. Is that all? No. You're really one of the good guys. What I'm doing right now is not so good. Whose loft is this, by the way? The owner's a friend of mine. He's abroad. He's been abroad for a long time. I love you, Ann. - You don't have to say that to me. - But I mean it. I've never cheated on my wife before. I don't fall in love easily. I don't want you to fall in love with me. This isn't real life, you know. I want to be with you, Ann. - Stop or I'll get mean. - I've had enough of all the lies. All that sneaking around. I want to come clean with Eva. I want to leave her. The only people that can hurt you are the ones you love. - I would never hurt you. - I'm not talking about you. You don't know me. I am a whore, Bart. I sleep with men in exchange for money. But don't worry, mister psychologist. I won't bill you for the past few months. What are you talking about? Never mind. You don't know the half of it. - Does Bart cheat on his wife? - No, he's a dedicated husband. And a great father, I'll bet. You should go into politics. But you really messed up big time, didn't you? - Isn't that why she wants a divorce? - Divorce is not the word I'd use. We're temporarily separated. Why is that? My wife has... She's found out something about me that's made her very angry. You cheated on her? - Technically speaking... Yes. - How did she find out exactly? - The woman who... - With whom you had the affair. Apparently she expected more than just the single... Encounter. She turned up on my doorstep one day. That stupid cunt... The lady in question told my wife everything. I hope my wife can forgive me because I love her a lot. You know, cheating is easy. It's the getting caught that's a bitch. - Did you take her to the loft? - No, it happened in Dsseldorf. - What were you doing in Dsseldorf? - There was a trade fair. Matthias had two tickets. Two days away from home, it sounded like fun. - You were one of the lucky winners? - Yes, I was one of the lucky ones. You're chicken. She's been checking you out all night. Why don't you ask her over for a drink? You take your pick and I'll have whoever's left. - Those chicks don't interest me. - Why pass up a golden opportunity? - They're too easy for me. - Matt... No, really, I prefer women who are worth the effort, who are special. I prefer unknown territory. There's an entire archipelago waiting for you. The Maldives. Does Nathalie know about your little expeditions? Why would I want to hurt her, Rob? You also have a key. Or do you only go to the loft to do the dishes? - You're Dutch, too. - Nein, wir sind von Deutschland. I'm Anja. I'm waiting for one of my colleagues. Expensive joint, isn't it? Say, Anja, can I offer you a drink? If you insist. What are you having? Bubbly? - A glass of bubbly then? - Great. - You're chasing the hot chicks away. - All ugly girls have hot friends. What if she's the hot friend? - That's your problem. - I'm staying right here. Hey, Matthias... Look, it's daddy Concrete. And no mummy Concrete in sight. - You men are all the same. - So much wisdom. I'll drink to that. - You speak my language. - Yeah, right. A bottle of champagne and four glasses for the table at the back. Weren't you at my daughter's wedding? Friends of Tom's? - Aren't you the architect? - Matthias Stevens, I designed... I know who you are, Mr Stevens. Perhaps we should do lunch sometime. - I can always use an architect - I'd be honored, Mr de Nijs. I've got this huge project. A block of apartments. Luxury condos. Very trendy and all that crap. You might be interested. It's still a big secret so I hope I can count on your discretion. - I would be... - Discretion, Mr Stevens. I insist on it. Dictum sapienti sat est. A good listener only needs half a word. Are you a good listener? Absolutely, yes. Absolutely. I'm in software myself and I can be most discrete. Put these gentlemen's drinks on my tab. Have a nice evening, gentlemen. - And you too, miss. - Thank you. Who does that asshole think he is? Dictum sapienti sat est up his ass. Cheers. Look who's there. Another island hopper. And that is the alderman's whore. You want a refill? Hi, this is Ann. Leave your message after the beep. - Who are you calling this late? - I'm checking my voicemail. Your voicemail? What's on your voicemail? You're a bad liar, Bart Venneker. What's gotten into you? Is something wrong? I don't know. Maybe I should ask you the same question. Eva, I... I... I'm off to bed, okay? Don't forget to put out the light. I've got another one. Check this out: A three-year-old is in the bath pointing at his balls. He asks: Mom, are these my brains? And she says: No, son, not yet. I can't leave you alone for five minutes. Five minutes? Sarah, I've been waiting for you for an hour. Are you going to introduce your friends? No. Willem, if we get caught they'll kick us out of the hotel. I hope there'll be flowers at the finish line. And this is the pool. - Matthias, we should go, man. - We're finally having some fun here. A bit too much fun for me. Well, Matthias... Why don't you get undressed? You're the one who wanted to go skinny dipping. You lost a bet... And I've come to collect my prize. Looks like that squid is acting up. You mean the champagne, don't you? - There. - What? - The rest as well? - Yes. That's not too bad... For an old guy. You like that, don't you? Playing games. Your turn now. Is it still too exciting or are you starting to settle down? Rob, are you coming in? Don't just sit there watching. No, I'm fine, thanks. - Good things to those who wait. - You do like to play games. I'm better at this than you are. Can you feel me? Can I have the key to our room, Willem? Robbie, give us a minute here, okay? Bang, bang. Was that the first time you met her? Yes, that was the first time. Sarah Lunter. - I don't want to say goodbye. - I'm sorry it has to end this way. It can't end this way. Please... I'm sorry. I really am. - Why are you throwing that away? - It's empty. You were here last night, weren't you? Why won't you admit you were here last night? We are your friends. She was here when I left. She was still alive. - Someone else came after me. - Tell them. - You're only making things worse. - We have to call the police. - We can't solve this on our own. - Are you crazy? What will we tell them? What will we tell our wives? Matthias has something to tell us. What do you have to tell us? Get that, will you? - Who is it? - Some real estate agent. - Someone put the loft up for sale. - I told you, didn't I? - How is that possible? - She's to meet Sarah Lunter here. Who is Sarah Lunter? Who is that? And who decided to sell the loft? - You know her, Willem. - What do you mean? That's Sarah Lunter over there. - I've never seen her before. - That's crap. You have met her. - Why would you say that? - You met her in Dsseldorf. The last night at the bar. She was Anja's friend. - I was wasted. I don't remember. - You've made that clear, Willem. But you remember her, don't you Robbie? Is that her? Don't be an idiot. You talked to her. You saw her naked. How do I know that's her? I never saw her. You turned her over, not me. Do you know her or not? When I see a dead body, I'm not thinking of a girl I met in a bar. He's twisting the facts, can't you see that? Madam, I'm afraid you're mistaken. We don't know any Sarah Lunter. - Who is it? - I can't see her face. Was that what you forgot to tell us? I had an affair with her, alright? I brought her here a few times. But I swear on my children's eyes I didn't kill her. On your children's eyes? Get real. Did you bring her here last night? I ended the affair yesterday. Jesus, Matt. Bart, listen. She was alive when I left her here. And that still doesn't explain why our loft was put up for sale. Tell me to my face you're dumping me. How can I dump you? There's nothing between us. - Was that what we had? Nothing? - Don't make this any harder. - You know what I do for a living. - I don't care who or what you are. How many women did you take to that loft? You and your friends? Wait. You know I'm not like that. You know that. You're a bad liar, Bart Venneker. Here. I only need this when I'm there with you. Don't lose it. Just get in touch if you want to see me. Does your wife know you share a loft with your friends? - I don't share a loft with my friends. - Did you know the girl? Yes, I met her in Dsseldorf. Did you know Mr Stevens had struck up an affair with her? I'd be surprised. Do you get jealous when your friend is picking up beautiful women? - No, I'm not jealous of him. - Not jealous of him. I meant are you jealous of those women. What's that supposed to mean? Where do you get the nerve to insinuate that? - Why so feisty, Mr Hartman? - Matthias is my best friend. Well, that best friend of yours is giving everyone away. He would never betray his friends. You're full of crap, asshole. What did you call me? You asshole. First you accuse me... I told her we were through and then I left. - That's it. - That's it? Well, you made your point. When were you going to tell us? Put that knife away, dickhead. I don't know what happened next. I've got nothing to do with this. Maybe I wasn't the only one. Maybe she was seeing one of you as well. - Someone who is trying to frame us. - Frame you, you mean. You hypocrite. - It's your problem now. - Can't you see what's going on? Why meet an estate agent to sell a loft that's not hers? On the day she's found dead. What a coincidence. - Guys, we can't keep this quiet. - And then what, Willem? Are you dumping this mess on me? Willem, are you nuts? I'm here with someone. Annette's gone. What do you mean? She found out about Dsseldorf. That Anja told her what happened. - Does Annette know about this loft? - No, it happened in Dsseldorf. Annette is gone. What do I do now? She's my everything. Calm down. You didn't confess, did you? Never confess, Willem. Don't hurt them unnecessarily. They don't get that. Okay? Help me. You have to go talk to her. Tell Annette I love her and that Anja bitch is lying, okay? - She really listens to you. - Okay, I'll see what I can do. I love her so much. Everything will be alright. I'll take care of it, I promise. I just hope that's all she knows. Thank you. Now do you see the kind of mess this has got us in? I'm sorry, man. I never wanted this to happen. So, what do we do now? First we ditch the body and then we cover our tracks. - You can't just make her disappear. - It's our only shot. What a prince. You were lovers and now you want to dump her body. - What does that make you? - You're one to talk. How will you move her? Chop her hand off? Or do you have that key anyway? No, and I thought handcuffs were more your thing. She is screwing me over. Tom, calm down, okay? - Give me the key, Tom. - That filthy whore... You want the key? Here's your key. Calm down, will you? She's just a whore. You know what it is with whores? You can't rape them. Isn't that right? That's no way to treat a woman, you asshole. Any woman. What's wrong with you? You're high and you're beating up women. Do you realize you're putting all of us at risk? Do you? Shut your mouth or I'll do it for you. You're just like your father. Bart had more luck with his daddy, now didn't he? Bart who's always saving everyone. Where were you when we got beaten and mum pretended not to hear? Where were you then? You didn't care about us. It was me who had to protect our little sister. - We didn't mean anything to you. - I didn't know anything about that. - If I had known... - Then what? I would have gotten you out of there. Matt, empty your wallet. - That is what she wanted, money. - Shut your fucking face. I'll never forgive you for what you made me do today. Never. - Why weren't we told? When was this? - Two weeks ago. We agreed to keep it between us. Right, Tom? Between friends. You have nothing to teach me about friendship. That's why I didn't say anything. I thought you were involved. I thought you were here yesterday, stoned, riled up. - Fuck your excuses. - You should cut down on the coke. - Spoken like a true alcoholic. - Enough already. - You should hear yourselves. - This is what they want. They're trying to set us against each other. Screw us over. I'm afraid I have a confession to make. Can someone restrain Tom first? Now we're even, dirt bag. - Rob, what are you talking about? - You wanted honesty. I'm being honest. I'm putting all my cards on the table. Jesus, Rob. You're fucking kidding, right? So you recorded everything that went on here? Every woman we brought here? - Not always. Sometimes. - Only when you liked the show? - At least I don't cheat. - No, you like to watch. - You're sick, man. - I'm not the one who raped a whore. - I've got it all on tape. - Remember we're in this together. I want you to destroy every one of those DVDs. If you don't, I swear to God I don't care how this turns out. Wait, you've got a DVD from last night. You know what happened here. No, Matt. You didn't tell us you were coming last night. Against your own rules. And it's not the first time you break them either. Look who's scared now. Scared I've got all his affairs on tape. Don't worry, Matt. I'm your friend. I'm your best friend. My lips are sealed as usual. I've always known you were a perv. Getting off on your friends. You don't know anything about me. Did you see anything? Anything that might help us? Do you know what happened? If all the people who got cheated on or got hurt were to find each other... what do you think would happen? - What do you mean? - What do you think? - You okay? - I don't feel like leaving tomorrow. - Not looking forward to a vacation? - I don't feel like going alone. - The kids are coming with you. - You know what I mean. Why don't you join us? Just come with us. Okay, I'll work my ass off and I'll join you as soon as I can. I love you and the rest doesn't matter. What do you mean, the rest? Everything that's not important. All that is bullshit. Champagne? Gambling for Africa. Look, if it's a fundraiser mummy Concrete is invited. What happened with that project? I hear the permit's been approved. I don't know. Looks like I'm not allowed to play with the big boys. But they haven't heard the last of me. Gentlemen, congratulations. A wonderful initiative, gambling for Africa. - Ladies, good evening. - This is Matthias Stevens. He's the architect for the new building next to the DSM site. - Is that you? Wonderful building. - Thank you, you're too kind. Your husband and I talked about it in Dsseldorf. Too bad you weren't there. We discussed a trendy project. Do you recall that conversation, Mr Denijs? - You said I'd hear from you. - We're working on it. We just filed for a permit. Cross our fingers, just like everyone else. Yes, great. Are you a gambling man, mister alderman? And you, Mr Stevens? Do you enjoy taking risks? That depends on the stakes and on what the other party has to lose. You put it beautifully, if I recall correctly: Dictum sapienti sat est. Ladies, I'd like to wish you the best of luck at the tables. Because it's obvious you're already lucky in love. Thank you. What a nice man. Well, you're having fun. Try not to lose it all again now. - What are you doing here? - A girls' night out. - Looking for a man I can trust. - Annette... I want you back so badly. I'm sorry, honey. I made a stupid mistake. I was drunk. It didn't mean anything. I never got that. Why do it if it doesn't mean anything? - That's not very nice for the girls. - I promise you I'll change. How would you feel if I told you I wanted to have my own affair? You wouldn't do that, would you? Funny, you still see me as your faithful little Annette. Perhaps I've done it already. Maybe I got even with one of your friends. With Bart or with Matthias. Whom you sent over to talk to me. Oh, Annette is having such a rough time. Well look at that, you've won again. It's your lucky night. Just remember half of that money is mine. All of it, all of it. - Did you invite Linda? - You're hurting me. - Have you seen how slutty she looks? - I thought you liked sluts. Leave her alone, Tom. She's an adult. Ann, are you here? Mr Venneker, we really need to talk, you and I. What about? That architect friend of yours. He's playing a dangerous game. He'd better be careful. Could you give him that message? I thought this was going to be about Ann. - I'd like you to stop seeing Ann. - Really? - And why would I do that? - Because I'm in love with her. You're paying her for her services. I want you to let her go. That choice is hers. We're just two losers who take what she gives us. - Sorry but I never paid her. - That's true. You didn't. Not you... Not another word, Alex. You will pass the message along? Ann, I'll see you in a minute then? What did he mean by 'you didn't'? What does he mean when he says I didn't pay for you? I'm so sorry. Only the first time was paid for. I was only a whore the first time. All those other nights it was me. But who paid you that first time? - Come with me, now. - I can take care of myself. We're leaving now. - Didn't you hear what she said? - Back off, man. I'm serious. She wants to stay, clown or prick? Clown? Do I have 'clown' written on my forehead? Do I? It doesn't say 'clown', now does it? I never want to see you again. Do you understand? Not ever again. Get him out of my sight. Get him out of my sight. Come here. It's alright. Don't worry, it'll be just fine. Sarah, it's not what you think. - What am I thinking then? - She's the sister of a friend. Someone harassed her and there was a fight. - Is she the only one? - Don't be stupid. She's my friend's baby sister. One of my best friends. She's a child. What do you take me for? I don't know. I don't know what to think actually. Listen, I shouldn't be talking to you. My wife is here, okay? Do you love me? Of course I love you. You know that. In my own way. Yes, in your own way. But what if you had to choose? Sarah, it's not as simple as you think. Okay? Let's meet tomorrow in the loft. Nathalie's gone for the week. We'll have time to talk. - I could make it very easy for you. - What do you mean? I could help you choose. What are you doing? I'm so sorry, are you hurt? Don't do it. You'll regret it. They know. It's our wives. - Our wives set us up. - Why? Because they found about this place. - Why did you do it? - Why did I do what? I'm telling you. - It's our wives. - We are your friends. It's not your wives but your friends who found out the truth. - What's going on? - You still don't get it, do you? - Get his clothes off. - What are you doing to me? - Did you have to maul her like that? - That was the agreement. We didn't agree on all that blood. - The Latin was a bit much. - Guys, cut it out. Later, okay? You... It was you who killed her? We didn't kill her. We just found her, that's all. We were here this morning as well. Without you, Matt. - I thought she was asleep. - And Matthias knows her? She wrote him a farewell letter. We have to call the cops if it's suicide. We can't keep this quiet. Can't we drop her at her place? - Come on, Matthias is our friend. - Where is he, by the way? - I didn't call him. - What do you mean? Why not, Rob? Guys, there's something I think you should see. - Bastard, you've been filming us? - Not now, Tom. Beat me up later. Have a look first. You may change your mind once you've seen this. What do you mean? We're not going down for a mess Matthias left behind. Matthias wasn't always such a good friend. What is this? - What is this, for God's sake? - She was drunk. The night he went to talk to her. - Help me out. She listens to you. - Calm down. I'll see what I can do. Perhaps I've done it already. With Matthias, whom you sent over to talk to me. This isn't happening. Oh, Annette is having such a rough time. - How long? - It doesn't matter. - How long? - Since the day after your wedding. Is that your baby sister? She filled out nicely. They met here regularly. He was her first lover, too. The only people that can hurt you are the ones you love He paid her to get you here. He used her, Bart. Like he used everyone else. - I'll fucking kill him, I swear. - Calm down, Tom. Stick to the plan and we might pull this off. We have to keep him in the dark. Work together. - We have no choice. - The cops will question us. That's why we have to keep denying we share this loft. They'll play us off against each other. - You sound like Matt. - If this gets out we're screwed too. I'm in on one condition. I need to be totally sure he was here last night. I want to hear him say it. I'll give a sign. Break a glass or something. But we don't do a damn thing until we're 100% sure. So what's next? Now we provide alibis and stage everything. There's not much time. - I'll do it. - No, I'll do it. It's okay. You go out and be seen. I'll take care of it. - Where's that farewell letter? - Right here. You knew about this, all that time. You knew and kept your mouth shut. You're no better than him. - Be glad you know now. - Of course I'm not glad I know. What the fuck happened here? Tell me what happened. - How long has this been going on? - It doesn't matter. Is that your baby sister? She filled out nicely. They met here regularly. He was her first lover, too. You guys staged this whole thing? It was you who set me up? Bastards. Why did you do that to us, Matthias? Fucking hypocrites. You're all liars and cheaters, just like me. Why? Why for God's sake? Because it never meant anything. Because I'm above that sort of thing. I'm above it. - Am I dying? - No, you're not dying. She lured you here and sedated you and then she committed suicide. Fate will link us but you'll survive. We're friends, aren't we, Matthias? We are friends. They framed us. Me and Sarah, the whole thing's a set-up. - That's a funny story if you ask me. - But it's still true. I would like to believe you, Mr Stevens. What we need are facts... ...findings, evidence. Facts. Fact is that no fingerprints were found beside yours and Sarah's. They wiped everything clean. We found traces of sleeping pills and alcohol in your blood and hers. And there's the DVDs with your sexual exploits. An impressive collection, Mr Stevens. Rob made those recordings. I knew nothing about them. It's you on the DVDs. No friends, not Willem's wife or Tom's sister... It's actually just you, Mr Stevens. - Will we get away with this? - Jesus, Tom. Why couldn't you just tie her to the bed like we agreed? - She was already dead. - And so you mutilate her? I only spiced up her suicide, that's all. I hope your little improvisation won't cost us. No matter what he tells the police, we know nothing. Rob's right. This was not necessary, Tom. I hope we won't regret this. Put pressure on them. Willem's bound to crack, maybe Rob... We interrogated them. There's no reason to assume they're lying. And they have something you don't and that's an alibi. - Get real. Not for this morning. - I'm afraid so. Rob and Bart were seen on a cafe terrace and Willem was at work. Impossible. We spent a whole hour together at the loft. Where is Tom? Tom just came in with his father-in-law, Mr Denijs. What's Denijs doing here? According to Denijs they spent the day together at a building site. He was at the loft this morning. - Sorry, his alibi is bullet-proof. - I know why Denijs is doing this. I saw him in Dsseldorf with another woman. Tom knew that. He knew I was using it to pressure Denijs. That's why. So you were blackmailing Mr Denijs as well? The plot thickens. They're all cheats. They're the bad guys. - Just cut the crap and tell the truth. - Fuck off. We already know what happened. You killed Sarah Lunter. I didn't kill her. Are you crazy? I didn't kill Sarah. You're free to go, Mr Venneker. Thank you for your cooperation. There's just one last thing that bothers me though. Why would Matthias keep accusing his friends? I have no idea. I don't understand it either. Is it possible that he's trying to cover up something else? What do you mean? Well... we're thinking perhaps he murdered her. - Your colleague said it was suicide. - Yes, it did look like a suicide. But the autopsy report said the sleeping pills didn't kill her. Her wrist was slit and she didn't do that herself. We didn't find any hesitation cuts on her arms. The initial attempts of someone trying to slit their wrist. - We found no such marks. - Matt would never do such a thing. Maybe, but let's not forget his fingerprints were found on the knife. Oh, and we didn't find a farewell letter either. Is something wrong, Mr Venneker? Is it possible that he murdered her? The autopsy report said the sleeping pills didn't kill her. And we didn't find a farewell letter either. - Is it wise for us to meet here? - I think we have a problem, Rob. We tried a bit too hard to cover our tracks. - What do you mean? - Where is Sarah's farewell letter? - Didn't you put it in your coat? - Yes, but it's gone. When did you take it? When the bell rang? Get that, will you? I'm sorry the letter's gone but why would I have anything to do with it? Why did you steal that letter from my pocket? The only real evidence of her suicide? Is it possible she didn't write that letter herself? - Could this be your handwriting, Rob? - What does it matter? Matthias deceived all of us. You saw the footage, didn't you? And it made us so angry we went along with your plan without thinking. What's your agenda, Rob? What happened here last night? What did you do to that girl? Was she getting between you and Matthias? Was she in the way? Not her. Still think it's exciting? She didn't get in the way. It was Matt who got in the way. Wait. Forget about him. Forget Matthias. He's much better at those games than you are. He's hurting you. Can't you see that? He's using you. - Why are you saying all these things? - I could never hurt you. If you could only give me a chance... What are you saying? I would never hurt you. I could never hurt you. Never. No, Rob, you're absolutely right. You could never hurt me. Do you know why not? Because you're a limp dick. And because I could never feel anything for you. How about that? Never. Maybe in the next life but certainly not in this one. So you were here last night? I knew they'd meet because Nathalie and the kids are in France. I waited for him to leave. She startled when she saw me. She cried. She said I was right about Matthias. A shoulder to cry on, that's all I am. - You gave her the pills. - They were a diversion. I gave her an insulin overdose. Works instantly. Leaves no trace. Jesus, Rob... Out of love. I did it out of love. Loving her hurt like hell. ...for Matthias. And it doesn't bother you that Matt is taking the fall? Matthias is a son-of-a-bitch. He used all of us. - Now it's his turn to be used. - You framed Matthias for murder. Sarah wasn't dead when we left her with Tom. - Impossible. - It's true. So Tom's the one who did it. Tom killed her. Your brother's sick, Bart. He's very sick. You're the one who's sick. I called them. Called them before you arrived. - I told them everything. - You're lying. You're bluffing. I know you too well. I thought I knew you, too. It's over. Believe me. Yes, it's over. - Don't. - Let go of me, Bart. Don't do it. Don't do it, Rob. - Tell Marjolein I'm sorry. - No, Rob, no. ...one year later. - He's having an affair, I can tell. - Not everyone cheats, you know. It's in the way he sips that coffee. Oh Gerard, watching you with that coffee gets my juices flowing. You horny devil. You know I get all wet when you talk dirty like that. - I'm gonna come all over this chair. - Guys, I'm off. - Are we chasing you off? - I've got the kids this weekend. Don't leave me here with my wife. One more drink? Next time. Hi, Ann. Long time no see. I still have a key. I don't think it'll fit anymore. Matthias lives there now. It's all he could salvage from the divorce. How's your brother? He's appearing in court next month. We'll have to wait and see. - What about you? Are you okay? - Fine, most of the time. Most of the time? The only people that can hurt you are the ones you love. - You taught me that. - I don't believe it anymore. I'm not the same person. I heard you even switched careers. So you've been checking up on me a little? A little. A little? Does that mean you'd like to have a little cup of coffee?
