Ten bucks he says these guys will "sway" the voters. - Nope. He'll say "woo". - "Entice". ,, all this in an effort to woo the state's undecided voters, Thank you. Uh, no cheques, please. I need those stats. I can't write him a speech that says "Take my word for it". - Thanks. - Hello, Julia. Larry, Curly, Moe. I see you wimped out on the anti-development piece. - What? - Page ten, next to the crossword puzzle? - Mr Ventura. - How's the school-aid speech? We can make a difference for these kids, if Lloyd gets behind it. Good, but we must find a hotter button to give the campaign a boost. - OK. Let me work on a few things. - Write a speech for Mrs Wannamaker. - Mrs Wannamaker? - She's addressing the Historical Society. The topic: Pioneer suffragettes. Here's your research. Thank you, dear. Can you send ten copies of this up to my room? - Sorry. - Pete! Hey, Pete! Yeah, hon, over here. Hi. You have a reservation for me? - You're...? - Eastwood. Clint Eastwood. - Are you gonna give me your name? - No, I'm kidding. Kevin Vallick. - Are you with one of the campaigns? - I just got hired to write some speeches. See if I can't turn this baby around, know what I mean? - Which candidate, sir? - Uh, you know, uh... whatshisname. Uh... Come on, help me out here. - Republican or Democrat? - Republican. - Garvin. - Garvin! That's him, yeah. Yeah, Garvin. Second floor. Elevator's right behind you. - Nice, quiet room, right? - Very quiet. - Dark? - Dark. - Soft mattress? - Softest we've got. - Real big one? - The biggest we've got. Cos I cover a lot of territory on a mattress, you know what I mean? And I don't want you sneakin' up there and botherin' me. Wait. Can you...? Hold on. - Oh! - Hi. - Wish I didn't need it. - Yeah. My kid has this cough. - Really? - Yeah. Let me see that a second. I don't think these are for kids. These are... No, they're not. In fact, they're not even for coughs. No, I know that. I realise that. It's for me. His cough is keeping me awake. This is a tough call, cos my grandmother just came through some surgery, and, uh, she... she can't sleep. Really? How awful. What kind? What kind? Extensive. It was really, uh... extensive. She had some liposuction work done. I know. I said to her "Grandmother, you know, you're 80." "It's not like they're beating down your door." But she's vain. So... - I'll give... - Can we split it? You want to split it? Perfect. Let's go over it again. Here's how the black-hole theory works. Don't patronise me. I'm not patronising you. I'm trying to teach you something. Then be patient. Our unemployment cheques are here, so maybe if we put them together,,, Yeah, right, $280 and 85 cents, plus,,, $33 million and 55 cents, Eddie! They made a mistake, You gotta give the money back, - (slams door) - (waitress keeps snoring) - Hey. - Hi. Hi. - How's the kid? - Oh, it's sad, really. He was abducted by aliens. How's Grandma? Sore.

Oh, well, I shouldn't say. I never really watched a whole one. It's OK. No, it's all right. Really. You probably watch PBS. - Oh! Oh! - ,, the ditch that divided New Mexico, Is the ditch a blight? Is there a better way to stop illegal immigration? - What is this? - The Mexico Ditch. - Oh. - It's to keep out illegal aliens. It's completely barbaric, but Garvin is for it, of course. - You don't like Garvin? - Republican simpleton. - You like him? - Better than the other guy. Wannamaker. At least he doesn't hang around with junk-bond kings with slush funds. I just prefer him over some tax-and-spend, knee-jerk liberal is all. - Let's drop it. - Good idea. Good idea. You know what? It's our first fight. It's OK. It had to happ... Sorry. - Let me know when I'm charming you. - Oh, just a few more moves like that. Pie? You like breakfast burritos? I know this place across the border. - Takes 35 minutes. - We just had pie. - They're really good burritos. - Mom told me never to go with strangers. - We'll pick her up. Where's she live? - Rhode Island. All right. 45 minutes. We'll put her in the back. Get your motor running Head out on the highway Looking for adventure in whatever comes our way Best cure for insomnia? Hot laundry. Take all your laundry fresh out of the dryer and pile it all on top of you. Now, if you really wanna sleep, you take some Fresca, you beat in three raw eggs, touch of cayenne pepper. I tried it. Ha! I'm kidding. So, uh, what do you do, Julia? - I write, too. - Are you a reporter? - Yeah. - Yeah. I saw your, uh, press badge on your bag here. - Oh, uh-huh. - I'm very observant. So who's "R Freed"? Fasten your seat belt. - You always drive this fast? - No. This fast. - Hey, Julia. Are you divorced? - Hm? - Well, you got a tan line there. - Oh. Long engagement. Oh. It's over? Yep. Very boring. Not of interest. ("Big Girls Don't Cry") - Hey, what's wrong with that? - Wait, wait, wait. I'm celebrating my second anniversary. Of my divorce. Oh. Yeah, very boring. Not of interest. - Would you please find a station? - I'm looking for a song. Our song, if you must know. So, we've graduated to "our", have we? About two hours ago. I wish you'd keep up, Julia, if this is gonna work. - Figured it out? - Yeah. Oh. So, whaddaya think? You know, us. - Do you think we have a future together? - Pff. Good. Me too. A que lejos queda el carro? - Como unos diez minutos, - Gracias, - What'd he say? - He said about another ten minutes. - You don't speak Spanish? - Uh-uh. A very romantic language. Necesito una toalla, - That's pretty. What's that mean? - "May I have a towel?" Oh. Be still, my beating heart. You gotta love the language. - Is that cologne? - Black Flag. Great aftershave. You know, it's manly, and as you can see, not a bug in sight. - What do you think? - Not bad. ("No se tu" by Luis Miguel on radio) - Breakfast? - Most important meal of the day. ,, que me diste Y el momento que con besos construiste No se tu Pero yo te busco en cada amanecer Mis deseos no los puedo contener En las noches cuando duermo Si de insomnio, yo me enfermo Thank you. Me haces falta, muchas falta No se tu Well... You know... I mean... ("All Shook Up" by Elvis Presley) - The seat belt... - All right? I'm in love I'm all shook up Ow. The handbrake. Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak I can't seem to stand on my own two feet - The car. We're rolling. - Oh, I know. The clutch. - Just show me where your clutch is. - On the car. My tongue gets tied when I try to speak My insides shake like a leaf on a tree There's only one cure for this body of mine That's to have that girl that I love so fine She touched my hand and what a chill I got Her lips are like a volcano that's hot I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup I'm in love I'm all shook up - Ouch! - Hi. Good morning. - This is, um... - Kevin. - Dan. - Nice to meet you. - Kevin's a sitcom writer. - Yeah. I write for, uh... I write for sitcoms. It's nice to meet you. Here's today's schedule, Julia. - I'll see you inside. - Great. Thanks. - Who's that? Your boss? - Oh, it's like being caught by your dad. - It's bad enough they patronise me. - You know what to do? You're full of advice, aren't you? Best thing to do, when people try to patronise you, is yell. Shout. Let me put it on. Really. Speak louder than they do. They're trying to see if you'll wimp out. Just raise your voice a little bit. Try it. Let me know tonight how it works. I mean, we never got those breakfast burritos. - What time? - Eight. - My hair's a mess. - It's perfect. - Eight o'clock, in the lobby? - Out here. (photographer #1) That's good. (photographer #2) That's it. More smiles. - Oh, my stomach. - Whew. Campaign food, huh? - Mm. Watch the fish. - It's too late. Good luck. It needs a touch-up, Lee. Unacceptable, Annette. - Piece of shit, Kev. - 12,999, and there's an even 13,000. - Not bad. How are you? - That's why I fired him. See what you can do with it. Give it some humour, some heart. - You didn't sleep last night. - Ah, you know me. Solid ten minutes, I'm good for the day. Thanks for doin' this. Comin' out at the last minute. I know how you swore off this campaign stuff. Hey, don't worry about it. I owed you one. Hey, uh, where's he givin' this thing? - The barrio, three o'clock. - What's this, uh... what's this ditch issue? - The Mexico Ditch? Why? - Some reporter told me about it. It's a sore point with the Hispanic community. Our guy's for it. Don't bring it up in the barrio. - I bet our opponent does. - Spin it our way, Garvin'll love ya. - Hey, you think this guy's any good? - Of course he is. He's better than good. Would I have called you if he wasn't good? What reporter? - Just some reporter. - What's her name? - Hey, hey, hey. - Listen, Kev. It's a cutthroat campaign here. Don't do anything stupid. And for God's sake, don't mix with the enemy. Smile. Great, great. Just one more. One more. - That's enough! - Let's keep up the good work. - Mike, I have an idea for today's speech. - Not now. - The Mexico Ditch. Time to attack. - Listen, we have been over this. I am the press secretary. I make the policy decisions. Is that all, dear? (shouts) No, it's not! - Excuse me? - Firstly, the name is Julia, not "dear". Secondly, I don't like being patronised, Mr Kratz. I'm not patronising you, de... - Why are you talking so loud? - I am the speechwriter. I have ten years' experience. And if you think I can't handle it, let's talk to the campaign manager. Walk with me. Wannamaker attacks on the Mexico Ditch. We hold his statement till four. Garvin can't hit back till tomorrow. And guess where he's speaking today? - The barrio. - That's good. I'll try to get that approved. And next time, don't be so angry. We're in this together, don't forget. Oh. So, good, he could say something in Spanish, maybe? - What's the name of this town? - San Jose. Excuse me. Excuse me. Who are you? - I'm the new guy. - Oh, I'm sorry. Everyone, this is Kevin Vallick, our new speechwriter. He worked on the Tobin campaign in '84, remember? Fresh from Hollywood. He wrote Chuck and Eddie, - Oh, I love that show! - Thanks. OK, now, listen. This town, San Jose. Is there a local hero? Anybody save anybody from drowning? - Yeah, there's a spelling-bee winner. - Girl or boy? - Girl. - Perfect, perfect. OK, let's do this. Put her up on the stand with Garvin, and he will say "I'd like to introduce someone to you." Someone who makes me proud to be an American. This young lady is the state spelling-bee champion. Let's talk about Garvin's record on immigration. "I've a spotless record on Mexican..." "My opponent says he's a friend of minorities." My opponent claims that he is a friend to minorities. - Yes, good, good. - "But actions speak louder than words." But anyone can speak words. Acting actions, that's the important thing. My opponent claims... "Insecure friends... soon become enemies." Insecure enemies are soon at war. Now, this ditch... "...that separates the two great countries of Mexico and America..." ...it's really an act of friendship. - Talk about the economics... - No, it's a moral issue. OK. "It rebuilds the Berlin Wall, brick by brick. So I must ask my opponent..." ...torn down in Germany, rebuilt in America? - That's the sound bite. - It's a step backwards, - "Good fences make good neighbours." - "The beginning of a new intolerance." It is the American Wall. I call it... the Friendship Ditch. Maricon! You know, you're gonna get a sound bite outta this. Yeah, well, we'll find out at five. It's the Channel Seven Action News with Doris Wind, - Lead story? - If the Martians haven't landed in Taos. - Please, please. - Good evening, Our top story tonight, It was day two in the desperate struggle of one small bear cub to stay alive, - Teddy, a cub beloved by millions, - Get outta here with this bear. - How can he be the lead story? - Excuse me, can you try Channel Two? ,, at the bottom of a water well in the Albuquerque zoo, - In what is turning into,,, - Look, it's the bear again. Oh, my God. Every channel is covering this story? ,, as we enter day two of Bear Watch, Well, take a gun and put the little shit out of his misery. Good idea. - Even the youngest of bears,,, - This bear is everywhere. The bear and the... Now we're getting dancing bears. Oh, this is really lovely. I'm really pleased. - That's real cute. - Yeah, look, the top hat, the cape. - Unbelievable. - I'm gonna grab my phone. - Hello. - Hi. You out of breath? Oh, hey. How you doin'? Yeah, well, you know, 45 minutes on the StairMaster. - About tonight... - You're cancelling, Why? Cos I ran out of gas? I don't normally do that. We really oughta move past the gas gauge thing, cos that's shallow. - We're deeper than that, - Shut up. Let's make it midnight, OK? Is that too late? Whew. You kidding? Midnight. I just wake up at midnight. Me too. - Oh! It worked. - Good. Good. What worked? My boss. He thought I was gonna explode. Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, the... See? I told you. I told you. That's great. The more intimidating you are, the better. I might be outta line, but can I make a suggestion? Tattoo. Really mean-Iooking tattoo. You should get one. My old boyfriend had a tattoo. On the inside of his lip. - I'm sorry? - Know what it said? Uh... Oh, boy. "How am I driving? Call 1-800" and then a number? Did he have a really big lip? Was it Mick Jagger? - Come on! - Oh! Gotta go. Oh, yeah. Yeah, me too. OK. Look, uh... So, tonight then, right? - Midnight. - Yeah, midnight. Bye. ,, more and more, the fate of animals means less and less, Oh, put some pants on that bear! Meanwhile, Teddy's mother, Big Bertha, waits for some word, any word, of Teddy's fate, - Back to you in the studio, - They're killin' us with this stuff. - ,, politics as usual, - OK, here we go. With the election only 30 days away, both candidates vying for the vacant seat argued the merits of the so-called Friendship Ditch, Friendship what?! Yes! Dr Spin! - Whew! - ,, denounced by Lloyd Wannamaker, - Torn down in Germany,,, - Sound bite! Yes! That's it. No more bets. No more bets? How am I gonna get my beer money, fellas? But New Mexico business tycoon Eay Garvin defended the Friendship Ditch,,, Friendship what?! ,, the Friendship Ditch ensures our security, it ensures our friendship, They had to know we were attacking the ditch. Friendship what?! Our resident genius. - Great speech, Kevin. - Thanks. Oh, there's a career seminar at Mesa Junior High tonight. - They wanna hear from our speechwriter. - Whoa. Gee, I can't tonight. - I got something really important to do. - Well, you'll be done by eight. Why? Seeing your reporter? No way. Uh-uh. I took your advice on that. I'll give a short introduction, then let you two start. - I'm sorry? Two? - Uh, she's a bit late. - Mr Wannamaker's speechwriter. - Oh. - You're fine with that? - Oh, sure. Oh, here she is. Meet Mr Wannamaker's speechwriter, Julia Mann. And, uh, Mr Garvin's speechwriter, Kevin Vallick. - Have you two met already? - Yes. - No. - No. I'm sorry, I thought she was... she was somebody I knew. A reporter, actually. Why don't we get started? Uh, Miss Mann, could you come sit over here? People! People! Calm down. Take your seats. Now I'm sure we've all heard the horror stories about politics and politicians. Well, Mr Vallick and Miss Mann were nice enough to take time out from their busy schedule to show us there is a human side to politics. Maybe we'd better start with questions. Anyone? Mm-hm? I was interested in politics, but my dad said that only liars go into it. - Bobby, I don't... - I can respond to that. Most people in politics aren't liars. It's only the opportunistic ones from other fields, let's say TV comedy writing, the last stop of the untalented, who turn into liars. - I see. - Oh, and hacks. (nervous giggle) Well, maybe Mr Vallick could offer us a different perspective. Bobby? Yeah. Hey, there are frauds in politics, sure. But you know what? There are also some passionate, seemingly idealistic individuals... - That's very encouraging. ...who turn out only later to be frauds. Any... other... questions? Is there much interaction between the two campaigns? Between Democrats and Republicans? Ah, I think this is your area. Uh, it's discouraged for campaigns to socialise. If one speechwriter were to date another, they might reveal something about the campaign. Some campaigns have spies for just this purpose, to pursue someone on the other campaign, to seduce her... - Or him. ...and try to find out her secrets. On the other hand, sometimes people have a tendency to get "paranoid". And just because someone seems interested in them, that doesn't mean they're after their secrets. Still, it's not paranoid to be suspicious of, let's say, a relationship that moves too fast, a chance encounter that isn't chance. - Or somebody lying about their work. - Or asks too much about work. Of course, a speechwriter could, to use Miss... Sorry, I forgot your name. - Mann. - Yeah, right. To use Ms Mann's example, a speechwriter could protect herself... - Or himself. ...from being compromised by not flirting. You know, not sniffing around like a cat in heat. Or she might tell the other speechwriter "Peddle your shit elsewhere, scumbag." - I really think we ought to veer... - Once the infiltrator, or "slut-spy", for lack of a better word, has been uncovered, the other speechwriter's passion for the campaign is renewed. And he'll need it. If he's a has-been, jumping from field to field like a fuck-happy rabbit, with an inadequacy born of inexperience... Or the lack of creativity born of over-experience. ...he'll need motivation, especially against someone who believes in her cause! I'd like to thank both Mr Vallick and Miss Mann for their illuminating words about politics, the human side. - You lied to me. - You lied first. - First? This isn't grade school. - It is. You used me. You took the Mexico Ditch! You never even heard of it before! Of course. I didn't realise you had a copyright on a ditch. - What other forces of nature are yours? - I will keep this simple. I. Me. This person in front of you. I do not. Not. The international symbol for "no". - I do not want you near me again! - Hey. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. - So are we still on for midnight? - Ohh! My opponent has accused me of playing politics. My opponent has accused me of taking his issue - his issue, the Friendship Ditch - and using it for my own ends. Perhaps he should warn me of any of other issues that come up that are strictly his! Garvin continued to accuse Wannamaker of using the Friendship Ditch,,, And I wish Mr Garvin would treat this process with some dignity! With only three weeks left until the election, why can't he decide whether he wants to be a candidate or a businessman? Why doesn't he stop jumping from field to field like some slaphappy rabbit? Come on, Mr Garvin, Why are you treating this campaign like some slick sitcom, with sound bites worthy of a Hollywood hack? That's why I'm travelling across this great state of New Mexico, - To hear your concerns, - Let's go, guys. Go, go, go! So goodbye, and God bless! Move, move, move! (man) Hey, Freed, man! ...balloon fiesta at four o'clock. Great visuals. Baghdad Bob? Slummin' it in local news? Whew. Ah, I just follow the story. - Come on. This isn't Iraq. - Yeah, well, it's early yet. Excuse me. - Hi there. - Hi. - Guess who. - Oh! - Bob. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - You glad to see me? Surprised to see me? A little less than thrilled to see me? What was the middle one? - I'm just here on business, Jules. - My God. Albuquerque's been invaded. No, we're doing the Senate races. Network sent me to cover New Mexico. OK. I chose New Mexico. It's a real interesting story. - And getting more interesting. - Oh, hi there. - It's a real honour. - Well, thank you very much. I'm not sure how long I'll be here with you guys. Yes, Bob's a busy man. Busy, busy, busy. Well, the congressman is free for a minute, and he'd love to chat. OK. Well, thanks. I'II... I'll be there in a little while. Oh, Jules, you look... You... You know what? I think I'll just get this out of the way and... be right back. - I'll be right back, OK? We gotta talk. - Right. Oh, my God. - Julia, bring those position papers! - I got 'em. Pete, hold your horses. We'll be there in two seconds. Get some cutaways of the balloons. So, Jules, what's the story? Oh, damn. What are they doing here? Bob, I'm a little busy right now. Yes, he's a beautiful baby. Excuse me, we need to step over here for a moment. You know what this state needs? More friggin' photo opportunities. What about this Proctor? I heard Garvin took a half-million-dollar bribe. That's the rumour. If you get proof, we can win with it. - So when's the debate? - Not set yet. Garvin's dragging his feet. - Why'd you move out? - No comment. You didn't even leave me a note. Two years. Two years of watching... You know, let's not get into this right now. - No, wait. Say it. - Bob, face it. You don't want a fiancee. You want a fan club. Well! Baghdad Bob. It's a pleasure to meet you. You too, sir. We're having a little get-together at my vacation home on Thursday. - I'm... I... You know... Uh... Sorry. - I would love it if... Julia! Time for happy hour with the press. We're not sounding too good on the debate issue. - Garvin's dodging us. - Absolutely. So hit 'em hard. - Hi, guys. - Hi, Julia. - On this debate front... - Is your guy backin' off? No. Wannamaker's position on the debate is clear. He wants one. - But where's Garvin? - Look, the debate is a non-issue. - The real story is Garvin's cowardice. ...call Lloyd Wannamaker cowardly, Excuse me? Sorry, I was... I wasn't talking to you. - No, I know. You were plagiarising me. - I didn't even hear what you said. Come on. You're standing right behind me! Obviously you're more conscious of me than I am of you. How can I not? You're wearing a quart of cologne. It's... it's aftershave, and it spilled. I wouldn't put cologne on for a balloon... God bless you! Vote on the 8th! - Would you leave me alone, please? - I'm on my way to my car. Which, by the way, has a pinging sound in it ever since you drove it, thank you. Hey, there's... What's that guy's name? Beijing Bob? That's Bob Freed. That's "R Freed"? Wait a minute. Nah. You and Mr Flak Jacket? - Are you jealous? - Why would I be jealous? - It's so clear who you're interested in. - Yeah, and getting clearer. - Going my way? - Come on. I'll give you a lift. Thank you. Hey! Hey! ,, via ropes and pulleys, And although no one's sure if the young bear cub has actually touched the meals, one can only assume that after several days, a young bear cub would have to be pretty hungry, Is there any word yet, Jim, on, uh, what the food consisted of?

My sympathies with unions are strong. Let me tell you a little something about myself. I come from a blue-collar background. My dad worked for the Southern Pacific ever since he came to this country. I started working for the railroad when I was 16 years old. Hard 12-hour days. Picture the grime, the dirt, the smell of sweat, the despair. Can't you hear the whistle blowing?

Kev, this isn't cutting it. It's supposed to be a friendly speech. - Comfortable? - Yeah. "Wannamaker has run a sloppy, inept and hostile campaign." - Good. - "He's incompetent, mean-spirited, and out of touch with the voters." - What's the problem? - Where's the friendly? Read the next line. - "Still, he has the right to run"? - There you go. I don't... I don't understand wh... - That's, uh... - Wannamaker's staff. Their campaign manager, Dan Ventura. What happened to mixing with the enemy? - What are you doing? - Huh? Oh, my... my back. It helps it a lot if I crawl around on the floor like this. They're here to negotiate. I'll introduce you. No, that's OK. So lighten up on the vitriol, Kev. Wannamaker'll be backin' off soon anyway. You know Julia Mann? - Who? - Campaignosaurus. She's been on a dozen of 'em. Didn't you meet her at that junior high thing? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, right. Julia Mann. - We hear she's the one mixin' the mud. My back. Helps it a lot if I can just, you know, lean against something. Whew, there you go. Well, here's the thing. She doesn't know it yet, but end of the week, she's out. - What do you mean, "out"? - They're replacing her. Ever since the Friendship Ditch, you've been kickin' her butt. It's exciting to see, Kev. What's doing it to you? (knocking) I'll explain later. - Let's go. - I'll be there in just a second. OK. Great. We'll just go wait out here.

I wanted you to know, that's all. Anyway, uh, what was it you needed to tell me? Uh, nothin'. (honking) - Hey. Car trouble? - No. No, I'm fine. Nice rental. Did you see the, uh... the polls? We're sliding. Yeah, that's temporary. We're gonna get him on that... (Kratz) On the what? The, uh... the thing we were talkin' about. - What thing? - The thing wi... uh... with the other thing? What? The... What? What on earth...? The... the fish? The porpoise? The whale? The... - Can we talk about this later? - Oh... Let's not talk about it now! OK? Julia, is something wrong? You're acting kinda unfocused lately. - What? Unfocused. I... Wha...? - Never mind. It's all right. We'll talk. What? Uh, wh... That's it, Kevin. You're on your own. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I've been thinkin' about what you... Wait! Wait a second. Look, congratulations on the engagement. I mean it. There. See? There's no reason we can't be friends now. - What? We're in a campaign! - So? It... What's the matter... Look at these hands. You can't go back to the hotel like that. OK, a framed picture of JFK in the living room? In the kitchen. You're good at this. You bet. You probably graduated near the top of your class. - Uh, valedictorian. - Ooh, very near. And you were class clown, no doubt? I was voted Most Likely to Embarrass My Family. - You would've hated me in high school. - No, I would've avoided you. - Did you always want to write sitcoms? - No. I always wanted to write. I was a speechwriter before, then I found out I believed in my words more than the candidates did. So I quit. You know, sitcoms are depressing too, but the money's a whole lot better. - Hm. You're so funny. - Why? You're cynical on the outside, but on the inside... What? Not like Bob? Is Bob warm and gushy on the inside? Is that why you guys decided to get engaged again? We just need some time, that's all, to, uh, fall in love again. - What? - Nothing. - How come I don't trust you? - You know, I honestly don't know. - What the hell are you doing? - Take your shoes off. OK. Hey, Julia. What would you do if... you weren't campaigning? You know, what if you... if you were... Well, what if you quit? I won't quit. I spent ten years on losing campaigns. - Clinton made it, now it's my turn. Why? - You want some advice, Julia? You're a regular Dear Abby, aren't you? Get in here. Put your feet in. Your boy Wannamaker... He's a total stiff. - Aiee! Hey! - It warms up. - Ohh. - You have nice feet. Thanks. Well, you know, I work out. - Yours aren't so bad either. - I like feet. They... reveal things. Yeah. They say something about somebody's personality. - My advice, Julia? - Hm? Wannamaker needs a "ya-see-Timmy". - A what? - A "ya-see-Timmy". At the end of every episode of Lassie, Timmy's mom said "You see, Timmy..." - And she'd teach him a lesson. - I can't believe I'm listening to this. It was always hopeful, it always had heart. That's what his voters want. They just wanna see if the guy's got anything going on inside. When? When does it get warmer? Why are you telling me this? It doesn't do you any good. You're right. I'm doing it because... I like you. That, and... I know Wannamaker can't pull it off anyway, so I'm not really worried about it. Boy, he doesn't get it. Campaigns are about one thing only: Winning. No, they're about changing the world. I hate that. I hate how people treat it like it's a game. Like it's all some race, with winners and losers. What we do affects people. And the people who'll do anything to win do anything to keep on winning. Why are you looking at me like that? Cos I haven't heard anybody talk like that in a long time. You should run. - Julia? - What? I wanna tear your clothes off. - Hey! - Hey! - Hey, you... - No! All right! Truce! Truce! All right, wait, wait, wait. Really a truce this time. All right? I mean it. It's just immature and foolish. Look, your hair's a mess. - Julia? - Don't. I know what you're gonna say. - I can't. - They're going to fire you on Friday. (sighs) Why do I do these things? (TV) The president's note read "America is proud of your courage and diligence," "All we can do now is pray," And that seems to sum up the mood on this, day 15 of Bear Watch, Michelle? (Michelle) How have local children reacted to Teddy's dilemma? Child psychologist Lydia Stern,,, At a certain point you don't worry about the scuds any more. You just do the job. Cos the audience has a right to know. God, he's much sexier in person, huh? So I've enjoyed these experiences all over the world - Grenada, Belfast, - lately in South Africa. - I heard he was gay. Oh, come on. He's engaged. Well, he was whistling show tunes in the elevator. (hums "Just in Time" by Tony Bennett) - Hey, top you off there? - No, no. I can't drink that much. - Can you do this? Here. Try it. - Why? I don't know. Haven't you ever done anything just to do it? - Like get a tattoo? You ever get a tattoo? - Yeah, once. - Where? - Maui. No, I mean... you know... - Hey, d'you hear I'm gettin' married? - Yeah, I heard. - Yeah. Dumb move. - Huh? You don't really know that many married people who are actually happy. - What are you doin' it for? - Oh, man. My life - I need some security. Hey, you see that? Iraq. Shrapnel. Wow. See that? Guy threw up on me once in a bar in Pittsburgh. - Whew! Brutal. - Yeah. Hey, uh, let me run something by you, Bob. - You can call me Baggie. - Really? OK. Let me, uh... let me run something by you, Baggie. How 'bout a piece on Garvin's handlers? You know, kind of a behind-the-scenes kinda thing. - Been done. - Not like this. You could follow us around, all day, all night. See how I write a speech from beginning to end. - What do you think? - Interesting. What's the access? Open. You know? No closed doors. Day and night. Spend all your time with me, I don't... I don't care. Call it "Handling of a Candidate" or somethin'. - Nah, I don't know. - What? Don't like it? To the end of the campaign? I made a commitment to be with my fiancee. What the hell, Baggie. I mean, she'll understand. What kind of woman would she be if she didn't understand? Damn. Got one of those damn canker sores. - Those are painful. - Do you ever get them? - Right up here? How 'bout down here? - No. - You have a lip tattoo? - A lip tattoo? - Oh, my God! - We have to be able to put a spin on this. - Oh, disaster! - Channel Two. We interrupt our regular broadcast to bring you this special news flash, On this, day 16 of Bear Watch, Teddy has been safely rescued from a well at the Albuquerque Zoo, It was senatorial candidate Lloyd Wannamaker who was the first to pull the bear cub to safety, Wannamaker took time out from his campaign to dig with other concerned citizens, Get back to me as soon as possible. We're living a nightmare. With other concerned citizens looking on, Senate candidate Lloyd Wannamaker was the first to pull the exhausted cub to safety, This bear is truly an inspiration, He taught me that even when all is lost, when the polls tell you to throw in the towel, there's always a light at the end of the well! Huh? - No more than three points, tops. - Three points? The guy just saved Winnie the Pooh, and you say three points! Why didn't you think of it, genius? And you, too, Annette. He's your guy. New Mexican tycoon Alan Proctor was in the news again with rumblings from a Santa Fe grand jury,,, Mr Vallick? For you. - You won't believe it! You really won't! - Julia, this is enemy territory. - You'll get in trouble. - I'm press secretary. - You're kidding! - No! Wow, that's great! Good for you. Let me ask you a question. The bear thing. That was your idea, right? Yes! They fired Kratz and they made me press secretary. And I owe it all to you. - No! - Yes, because that idea and everything... Anyway, I just... I wanted to thank you. I wish there was some way that I could repay you. - But perhaps you'll accept a mint. - A mint? Yeah. Well, a mint. It was a lot of advice, the number one news story. Hang on. You're right. And... some shampoo. Oh, well, there you go. Mint and shampoo. Done deal. And it's organic. So what did, uh... what did Bob say about all this? Oh, I haven't told him yet. Really? You came here first? Yeah. Well, you know, you were closer. Geographically. I'm pretty close now, actually. Geographically. Anyway, I better go. Um... - I have to go tell, uh... - Bob. - Yeah. Anyway, thank you. - Sure. You're a good friend, but I am gonna kick your ass in November. - Well, I wouldn't bet on that. - Oh, I would bet on it if I were... - Que,,, que, uh,,, que hacen aqui? - Uh... Necesito una toalla, Oh, look at that. They were there all the time. Funny. Thank you. See ya. Don't feel bad, She didn't appreciate you, So, yeah. It's a... behind-the-scenes thing. "The Handling of a Candidate". But the point is, I'll be with the campaign 24 hours a day from now till the election. - You said we'd spend time together. - Yes. I'm doing it on your campaign. I'm doing it on you, - What do you think, press secretary? - I'll see if I can get it cleared. - Hey, you want a little more? - Yeah, thanks. I think we are stuck together for the rest of our lives, for all eternity! I can't think of a more frightening idea, Bob? Let's say you were married for one year, and your wife comes to you and says "I met a man at a party." "I slept with him. I promise it'll never happen again. I still love only you." What would you say? Well, I'd say "Hey, you know, I love you too. I won't pretend it doesn't hurt me, but maybe we should just get some counselling and try to put the whole thing behind us." - But you'd forgive her? - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'd have to forgive her. - OK? - Yeah, sure. Helen was too selfish for you, You can't be selfish and be a friend at the same time, Friendship is about self-sacrifice, Sacrifice is a two-way street, Like us, "You see, Timmy"! What? Timmy? Honey, who's Timmy? Con la noche que me diste Y el momento que con besos construiste No se tu Pero yo te he comenzado a extranar En mi almohada no te dejo de pensar - Hello? - Another word for "misconstrued"? What's the, uh, context? "My position on education has been misconstrued by my opponent." "Has been, uh... distorted." Great, Thanks, I knew you wouldn't be sleeping, Do you have a minute to talk? Yeah. Sure, sure, sure. I was just, uh, finishing a letter to, uh, your mom. - Say "hi" for me, - Sure will. - Can we meet? - Yeah. Sure. Let's meet in about, uh, 20 minutes. So, uh... how are you doin'? You and Bob. - Notice I didn't say Baja Bob. - Thanks. Um... Uh, great. We're... He's great. Good. Great in what way? It's for your mom's letter. You know, uh... generous. He fills my room with roses. Stuff like that. In fact, the thing I needed to talk to you about... Right. See, I'm not sure that we shouldn't... not see each other any more. You're not sure we should, or... you're sure that we should? - I'm sure that we shouldn't. - See each other? Wait a minute. Didn't you call me? Yes, right. I called you because I needed to tell you that we shouldn't see each other any more. Did we just enter another dimension? Why do you keep meeting with me, - to tell me that you can't meet with me? - Because it doesn't make any sense. My life doesn't make any sense. We don't make any sense. - Nothing makes any sense. I have to go. - No, wait. Wait a minute. - You just got here. - I have to get up really early. Bob is doing this behind-the-scenes thing... - Right. I know. ...on the campaign and me. He... What? Um, the days and nights of a press secretary. Right through till the election. - "The Handling of a Candidate"? - Yeah. So, uh, we'll be spending a lot of time together, and with his crew around... Anyway, I'm engaged. OK? And, yes, it is a trial engagement, I'll give you that. But still, I'm not being fair to Bob if I'm here. I know you'll say "But we're friends." Maybe friendship is an element in every relationship. Is Bob my friend? I don't know. But what I'm trying to say is... I have to go. Good evening. I'm Jim Rodriguez. In a campaign that seemed to provide more debate behind the scenes than in front, it finally comes down to two men. And though polls have Wannamaker ahead, experts believe that Garvin can only win tonight with a clear knockout. (Bob) The white bull. That's what Hemingway called the blank page. Every day the writer has to look that bull right between the eyes, with those dreaded words still looming: "Deadline, deadline, deadline." Good, like that. That's great. Ba-bee-bee-bee, ba-ba-boo, ba-ba. Muh-muh-muh-muh-muh-muh. Rik-tik-tik-tik-ting. Ten tiny tots on the train tracks. Ten tiny tots on the t-t... You know, gotta keep the tongue loose. Uh, guys, let's get a close-up on the screen now, see how she's doin' here. Oh, boy. You got a long way to go, huh? - Something's been distracting you, Kev. - I'm not distracted. And it's costing us. Ever since the bear they've been getting the better of you. - Who has? - Wannamaker. - Oh, yeah. - And I need that script for the infomercial. All right, all right, all right. What are you tryin' to do here? - Ooh! Ow! - God, Jules! You all right? - Uh-huh. - That was smart. Sweetheart? - Oh, I'm fine. - I'm gonna get you some ice for that. With the debate now only moments away, now the fight with nerves begins. Like Grenada, 1983, with the airborne division waiting for the night drop. Good. Cut. Oh, shoot. No, man, I... I gotta get her the... - Hello? - One minute! Hello? Anybody home? Hey, Jules? Hey, Jules, listen. I got a great idea. I've been meaning to run this by you. Bob, I'm a little busy right now. How 'bout we put a camera on your head, right? That way we can get your POV. What do you think? We gotta get you suited up. I'm not walking around with a camera mounted on my head. Well, why not? Julie-cam. It's perfect. Hey, is somethin' wrong? Something's wrong, isn't it? - Yes. - What? - I can't do this. - Well, the camera's not that heavy. It's lightweight, it's got fibre optics, remote control. It's... Oh, shit. Is it Timmy? All right, people, five-minute warning! We're live in five! God. - Kevin, this is not a good time. - I know. But listen. I... What's on your eye? What is that, a hickey? - Yes. Yes, it's a hickey. - Look, wait a minute. Julia. I have only one thing to say to you. - You can't marry Freed. - Why? Why? All right, I didn't expect you to ask me that. Uh... Wait a minute! - How many minutes? - Four. - Julia, listen. - Shh! Julia. You can't marry Freed. Ask me why. - Why? - Because... Julia, every day I don't see you... is painful to me. Every day I can't press my lips against yours... I feel like I'm gonna die. Better? Oh, yeah. Please... I really need to do this. This is so crazy. We're gonna get fired. - Dan! Hi! - Hey! - All right. Let me see. - Is it gone? Got it. She had a little piece of spinach there we were trying to get. Julia, drink a toast to Teddy for me. - Thank you. - Hi. Kevin, isn't it? Sitcom writer. Exactly. I was thinking about what you said about running. - You were heading off. - I gotta get goin'. No! No, don't leave. Watch the debate from here. I think I can make that happen. There's a congressional seat up in Rhode Island. - Three minutes! - OK. Three minutes. Good. - Think about it. - Great. Thank... Oh, God. - We gotta talk about this. - Hey. Bob Freed. - Have you met Kevin? - Uh, yeah. Sure. We're drinking buddies. - Since when? - Kind of. I heard about the behind-the-scenes thing, Baggie. Great idea. That was before Timmy. - Jules is a lot like you. She writes for... - Whoever pays the most! - So what are you workin' on now, Kevin? - Oh, good, everyone's here. - OK. Everybody ready? - Kevin was just telling us about his latest. Yeah. He's a good writer. It's shaping up great. - You've read it? - Of course. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I show everything I write to Lee. - Ah. What's it called? - What's it called? Uh... "Health Care Reform". "Show." - It's the "Health Care Reform Show". - Ten seconds! - What is it, um, comedy? Drama? - Uh, it's... it's a little of both. - We got Florence Henderson lined up... - Now is no time to play partisan politics. - Cue music. - Oh, look. Good evening, and welcome to the New Mexico Senatorial Debate, I'm lan Campbell, and I'll be your moderator, Tonight will be your one chance to examine the men who hope to represent you for the next six years in our nation's capital, It is an important decision, and one we hope you will take seriously when you go to the polls next week to cast your ballot, (whispers) God, you smell great. Let's get outta here. - Yeah. - I'll meet you outside. You go first. You have said that Garvin has run a Hollywood-slick campaign, - Kevin, where you goin'? - Uh, you know what, I... I'll be... I think I hear my car alarm out there. Is that what that sound is? It's really improved, Oh. Hey. You know, I have to just go call my mom, uh... ...to take her pills. She falls down if she doesn't take them. The... the not-falling-down pills. ,, but we raised the spirits of a state, Let's get outta here. - Ooh. - What's that? - Oh, I'm sorry. - Let's go. Did you do it on purpose? From the Latin, "paranoia". - Come here. - I am so glad to be outta there. By the way, I'm not marrying Bob. - You're not? - No. I'm glad to see Mr Wannamaker taking a more conciliatory tone, Good choice. I've made no bones about it, in fact, that this has been an unnecessarily dirty,,, ,, wherever you park your car,,, - America cannot be seduced, - What's goin' on? - America cannot be debauched, - Wait. Wait. ,, has flames of fire in him, and has skin,,, What's going on? Somebody tell me what this is. - My money's on Garvin. - Has Wannamaker lost some weight? (Tarzan yell) I don't have to tell you who gets hurt first when this sort of thing happens, Me, Tarzan, Jane, Tarzan, Jane, Tarzan, Jane, (Tarzan yell) - Ha! - What? Oh, yeah. Those were my serial-killer years. (snorts) - Did you just snort? - No. Yes, you did. You laughed, and then you snorted. - (snorts) - See? There you go again. You're snort-laughing. It's a common thing. Actually coulda used a snort-laugh here. Whoo! Such a bad attitude. Oh, I hate when people say "Smile!" - Yeah. Guess so. - Hey, isn't this some... - That's my ex-wife. Why's that in there? - You're kidding! You and Annette? I know. There's no explanation for some things. I don't understand it either. Probably a lot like you and Bob. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So what... what finally happened there? - What ended it this time? - The behind-the-scenes thing killed it. Really? - That's too bad. - At least say it like you mean it. OK. Let me try it. Well, that's too bad. How's that? - Kevin. - Julia. Say you've been married for a year, and your wife says... - Is this a test? - Yes. "I met a man at a party, I slept with him. I promise it'll never happen again, and I still love only you." - What would you do? - I'd take her to a really romantic spot, like a mountaintop, or a real pretty bridge, or something like that, and I'd push her off. - You wouldn't forgive her. - No. Well, maybe after the funeral. What would you do? - Same thing. - My kinda girl. Shall we speak the unspoken language of love? - You mean the kind only dogs can hear? - Yes. The very same. (barking and howling) (knocking) Kevin, open up! Wake up, sleepyhead! Kevin? Garvin is panicked. Chuck and Eddie are already here for this infomercial, and this script is shit! There are the research materials. Fax a new script by 6am, or you're fired! The election's a week away. I'm tired of you paying more attention to your reporter than to your job! Kevin. Kevin. Wake up. Wake up. Come on. You gotta... Kevin, wake up, OK? We gotta write this thing. Come on. - Are you awake? - Uh-huh. (snoring) There you go. All right. Come on. You really can't handle champagne, can you? OK. OK, here we go. Right up here. Come on, Kevin. Let's go. Kevin. Here we go. All right. Jeez, Kevin, when you sleep, you really do sleep. OK, here we go. Kevin, cut it out. Come on! We don't have time for games. All right, here we go. Come on. Now, where's the... where's the script? Here, wait here. Is it in here? Oh. I got it. OK. OK, here it is. Infomercial. Right there. OK. Here we go, Kevin. All right. Hold yourself up here for just a second. Let's get some light. Hang on. All right. Now, uh, you dictate and I'll write, OK? What would he say? What would Ray Garvin say? Let me tell you about... Go ahead. "Let me tell you..." Wait, Kevin! Are you OK? "Let me tell you about" what? Myself? My life? My prostate? Ah. "Let me tell you about my family." "During this long campaign..." ,, I haven't had a chance to just sit and talk, So I wanted to invite you into my home, where I can sort of let my hair down, Oh, I hope you don't mind. You see, I never miss making my kids' school lunches. Rusty? Spot? Hey, Euffles! Euffles! This is great. You're gonna love this. Oh, I'll show you later. - It's Chuck and Eddie! - (both) Hey! Julia? - Hey, Shakespeare! - Hey. Hi, guys. - Good stuff. - Best thing you've ever written. - Thanks. Thanks. - Let's get together, huh? Yeah, yeah. How's it goin'? - Hey, all right. - Hey. Home run. You know, one of the reasons both of you are out of work,,, Between employment opportunities, It's because of policies like those of my opponent, For example, if you give one of those eggs back to me, that's one less egg for investment, Euffles! Boy, you really saved my ass on this thing, Annette. Thanks. Julia! In related news, overnight polls show reaction to the senatorial debate clearly favouring Garvin, - Many believe he has the momentum,,, - Many?! Who, you and your cousin? ,, especially with tonight's daring campaign broadcast, - This is our man, - Ignorant populist bullshit! ,, which featured a guest appearance by sitcom favourites Chuck and Eddie, has clearly helped Garvin, Have we got the documentation yet on the Proctor stuff? That could blow up in our faces. Put it out there. OK. Time to play hardball. - Well, can't we first try to address... - I don't want to hear it. Get goin'. (Bob Freed's voice) - Julia Mann, please. - I got one for ya! You're nothin' but a horse's ass! - Are you all right? - Yeah. Shit, yeah. (phone) Hello. Hello. Hello? - What's going on? - Come on in. I just got off the phone with a, uh, reporter who, uh, is gonna run a story tonight, from an unnamed source, claiming that Ray Garvin accepted a $400,000 bribe from junk-bond king Alan Proctor. - What? - Oh, my God! Thus effectively ending our campaign. Someone turned our finance red file over to the press. And I'd just like to know why in the hell you did it, Annette. - You're kidding, right? - I wish I was. You're serious? I don't believe this. You have some gall accusing me. This campaign is my life. You can take your finance red file and shove it up your ass! - Goodbye. - Why would Annette do that? Only three people knew enough to be this unnamed source: Proctor, Garvin, and whoever gave the files over. So I ruled out Garvin and Proctor. - Which reporter? - It doesn't matter. - No, no, no. I need to know. - Bob Freed. Is Kevin Vallick there? Thank you. That's all right, thanks. You're amazing, Julia. I thought I was good. Oh, God forbid I endanger your position in the campaign! Where are you going? - I'm walking to a more appropriate place. - Where? A firing range? - OK, go ahead. What's on your mind? - Your little Proctor leak. Nice work. If you can't take competition... Oh, no! I can take the competition. It's the backstabbing that's the real drag. - I keep you from getting fired... - You keep me from getting fired? - You keep me from getting fired?! - What I did last night was a sacrifice. Really? Thanks. Thanks a lot. I didn't know sleeping with me was a burden. - That's not what I meant. - I should have known. I don't know why I don't realise this. I'm such a jerk. Politics and love never mix. Never. You know what, Julia? From the moment I saw you, I should have just run. Then run. Julia! Mr Vallick? Proctor bribes Garvin. Wannamaker goes to the press with the bribe story. And Garvin is ruined. All right? It's all very convenient. The question is, who gave the information to Wannamaker? - I already know who gave it. - Proctor. - Why would Proctor do this? - He bribed both candidates. He kept 'em both in his pocket. And he decided he wants Wannamaker to win, so he's destroying Garvin. I want him to lose. And I want Garvin to hire me when you win. ("Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word" by Elton John) (phone) What do I do to make you love me? What have I got to do to be heard? What do I do when lightning strikes me? What have I got to do? What have I got to do? When sorry seems to be the hardest word I would like to introduce New Mexico's newest senator! The only man who will do everything in his power to make sure that this is the most progressive state in the Union! - Hi. - Hi. - I was just leaving. - Yeah, I saw your car. - Yeah, I've been trying to call you. - I've been really busy. Sorry. - I stopped by the hotel. - I just haven't had a minute to myself. Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for our new senator! All right, I'm gonna say this real quickly, OK? Look, Julia, I'm really sorry. I didn't know. I feel like I blew it, and I... - This is really hard for me to say. - Harder than not trusting me? No, no, no. I just... I couldn't have done it without my staff! Come on, guys! Come on up here! - Come on, Julia. - Come on, he wants us up there. I, uh... - What? - Congratulations! - Get used to winning, Julia. You're next. - Uh-huh. Right. Look at him. He'll never know how close we came. How close did we come? You sure you don't want to be kept in the dark on this? Wannamaker took money from Proctor, too. Fortunately, Proctor wanted our guy to win. Thank you. Have a nice evening, sir. What am I doing? I also wanna give a special thanks to my press secretary, a real trouper, Miss Julia Mann! Oh, come on, Julia. Come on out here and take a bow. Come on. Come on. She's a little shy, folks. No se tu Pero yo quisiera repetir El cansancio que mi hiciste sentir (over Tannoy) Uh, pardon me, Julia? Kevin? Can I talk to you for a second? - Where the hell are you? - Up here, on the balcony, A little to your left, A little more, Eight here, - Hi. - There he is, right up there. Get rid of that guy! What the hell is this? I've got a speech to finish. I know all about Proctor, Lloyd. OK? So stuff it. You're already finished. Go ahead, Kevin. You have something to say? Here? Look, I just... I think maybe there's this tiny little possibility that maybe we, uh... we make sense. Well, we did sleep together, I'll give you that. No, I mean we actually slept. Sleeping slept. I... I haven't slept like that for a long time. - Unlock the door! - Look, Julia, let's face it. We belong together. Why? God, I'm a writer. I should be prepared for this stuff. Uh... Because after all we've been through, Julia, I mean, look at us. We're still here, aren't we? I mean, we're still together. - Kind of. - That's it? Can't do any better than that? Can't do any better... Uh... - Open the door, sir! - Well, uh... - Push it. - Unlock the door, sir! Wait right there. No. Kevin. - Get him! - Oh, shit. (cheering) - Kevin! - Julia! - Tarzan! - Jane! - I love you, Julia. - I love you, Kevin. What did the lip tattoo say? - Kiss me. - "Kiss me"? Nah, you're making that up.
