There are 10 million people here, 10 million souls, each one of them searching for meaning in their lives. But how many actually find it? See that cross? Countless people pass underneath it every day, but how many notice it? And for those who do, what does it mean to them? Ask me, and I'll tell you it's about forgiveness and redemption, because I know that's what it's supposed to mean. But what does it really mean? This is the story of 12 souls who are about to find out, 12 lives who will intersect at the cross, where they will all face the same question. Airway constriction. Filled out for oxygen. We're pushing 100% at 15 liters per minute. Rather not trach, unless you advise otherwise. Affirmative, 81. Let's try not to cut her unless we have to. Come on, girl, breathe. - She's breathing on her own. - Got it. Okay, eating Chinese takeout with a severe food allergy. I'm gonna go with "Suicidal" for $1000, Alex. The EMTs already pushed 5 milligrams of epinephrine. Yeah? Anyone bother to tell them that's a lot of adrenaline for a girl this size? They had trouble maintaining her airway. That is why they call it severe anaphylaxis. And from the looks of things, she couldn't care less whether we save her or not. How can you make an assumption like that? Several lacerations on the lower arm. You have another theory, a better theory you'd like to propose, nurse? I want a stat chest X-ray and a round of labs. Yes, doctor. Hey. Hey. How's she doing? She'll be fine. Yeah, well, she's lucky someone called 9-1-1 when they did. Yep. You gonna be home for dinner? Maribelle's decided it's time for the flu, so I'm working a double. Again? Hey, you're the one always saying we need extra money. No, I'm the one saying we need to spend less so we don't need the extra money. Gotta run. Can you check and see whether maybe she's been skipped over on the list? She's in the system, so we can get her in as soon as we can. We've been here for 6 hours, please! What do I have to do to get a doctor to see my daughter? She has a really high fever. All you can do is wait. She's in the system, she hasn't been skipped over. I mean, we'll get to her as soon as we can. Are you sure you're okay? You heard the doctor. He said I'm fine. - Just take it easy, J.D. - What? I'm walking. Well, walk more slowly. Would you relax? Until the Good Lord decides it's time for me to go, there's nothing gonna kill me. Once he decides it is time, there's nothing gonna keep me. Not much point in worrying about it, either way. That's a nice butterfly. I love butterflies. Do those wash off? Afraid not. What's your name? Lily. That's a beautiful name. I like it. It's different. It is different. My name is Joe. Nice to meet you, Joe. Nice to meet you, Lily. Do you wanna see the pictures I drew? I'd love to see your pictures. I like this one. I love that one. And, look, you even spelled it correctly. I believe I'm a good speller. I believe you're correct. Well, you can tell I love blue. Blue is my favorite color too. Lily, what are you doing? Nothing! I was just gonna show Joe my pictures. Don't be upset. It wasn't her fault. We were just talking-- Okay. It's not that. It's just that I just can't even get somebody to even take a look at her. I'm fine, Mommy. You don't need to worry about me. Hey, guys! Sorry to rush you out here, Pastor, especially for a false alarm, but my pacemaker thought my battery was running low. Ha! No worries. Better safe than sorry. He still thinks he's 17. Yeah, and whereas she's convinced I'm 117. Personally, I like my fallacy better. It's not funny, J.D. We've lost enough already and I'm not ready to lose you too. If you could talk nicely to each other, we'll get you some ice cream. I don't want any ice cream. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. If you'll look at your screen, you'll see the next patient's name is Joe Phillips. I'm Joe Phillips. And I'm asking you, will you give Lily my spot? Whatever. Hey, Gina, can you take that little girl over there into Room 3, please? Yeah, sure. Bless you. Thanks. You realize we're both gonna die eventually, right? I know. But if you were a gentleman, you'd let me go first. Duly noted. Well, thanks again, Pastor. You bet, anytime. Oh, I hope I'll see you at service Sunday night. We'll be there. A world rushing to its destruction. You know, devil done dug a deep hole for y'all. People fighting each other to be the first to jump in. You got to deal with this cross, brother. You got to deal with it. You got to deal with it! Ha! Excuse me? Young man, you believe in the cross of Christ, son? I'm a pastor, so. You didn't answer my question. I asked you if you believe in the cross of Christ. Yes. See, the cross is blood-stained, painful. It loves and forgives and demands. But what does it demand? That we profess it to this dark world. And if you believe, then the question is what are you gonna do about it? Hey! Go around the side! Hey! Hurry up! Hurry up! Let's go, let's go! Hey! Hey! What you are doing is wrong. It's against God's law. Back on up, ol' creepy, unless you want your timecard punched. I'm ready. Are you? You know what I'm gonna do? Why don't you tell me? I'm going to pray for you. All of you. Yeah. You do that, you old fool. Yeah, I'm a fool... ...a fool for Christ. Me and Paul! Paul and me! Excuse me. Are you okay? What do you think? Look, I know you don't know me. Is there anything you need? What are you, some kind of freak? No. I'm just someone who wants to help. Yeah, you're all scared. You thought he was gonna swing that thing at me, huh? You thought he was gonna use his Jesus powers? Hey, Pretty Boy, you awful quiet, brother. What are you thinking? That old man, he was ready to die, yo. And what if he's right? What if we're going up against God himself? Hey, that's funny, dawg. Forget it. Yeah, that's crazy. You hungry? Okay. Matthew, you promised. You can't just bring her here. I know. I'm sorry. I should've called first. Well, I can't just turn her away. I'm not asking you to. Just can't have her stay here. I'm sorry, I can't. Thank you. You're all set. Great, thanks. Well, here you go. I'll come to check on you in a couple days. I want you to eat and get some rest. Take care of yourself. Hey, thank you for helping us before. I'm really sorry if I was rude or anything. I didn't mean to be. No, don't worry about it. I'm fine. I'm just glad you got your Lily taken care of. How is she? I'm feeling better already. Yeah, she's gonna be good. They gave her some medicine, so... Shelter's closed. Okay. We'll be okay. And that's gonna be a problem, isn't it? No, we have a car. We're good. I know it's none of my business, but I don't think that's such a good idea. I mean, she needs to stay warm, doesn't she? Yeah. This may sound completely crazy, but I only live a couple of blocks from here. If you want, you and Lily can stay the night. Oh, no, no. I've got someplace else to stay. That's a very considerate offer, but I'm afraid-- It's okay, Mommy. Joe wouldn't hurt us. He's our guardian angel. Aren't you, Joe? I love butterflies. Carlos! You're back. You're back! Why didn't you call or something? Ah, you know me. Look at you. This time for real? They're not sending you back? No, deployment's over. I'm a nasty civilian again. Thank God. Come on in. Come on in. You could've rung the bell, you know. Bobby's home. Nah, I didn't want to wake the boys. It's not much. Pretty basic, really. Bathroom, bedroom, kitchen. Keys. You sure your friend's gonna be able to take you in at this late hour? I promise. He's always there for me. Don't forget your toothbrush, Joe. Good call, Lily. You gonna be all right? Lock the door behind me. Thank you. Good night. Good night. Okay, conscious, responsive, alert. Here's how this is gonna go. I'm gonna ask you a simple question. If you want to go home, you say yes or nod your head. You understand? Last night, you ingested a previously known allergen. Was that an accident? - Yes. - Really? Yes. Okay, then you're free to go. Be a little bit more careful next time, unless you want to see your name on a death certificate. Do you have someone to pick you up? Didn't you guys call my dad? We tried, but we couldn't get ahold of him. Is there anyone else? No. Are you gonna be okay? Yeah, I'm good. Thank you. Take care of yourself. So there we were, a dozen different souls, all moving in different directions. All searching. And now you know as much as any of us did a few days ago before the cross made its presence felt in each of our lives. When you gonna get a haircut, bro? 'Cause it's about that time. It's about that-- What time is it? It's about that time. Hey, boys, boys. On that note, on that note, later, G-ma. That was good. Thank you. Wait a minute, you out of here just like that? How 'bout you clear off the table first? Don't look at me. I did it last night. You got experience then, good. Keshawn, get back here and help clear this table 'less you want a whoopin'. Better clear this up 'fore you get-- before you get a whoopin'. Thank you. Uh, hey, dry them dishes off, boy. Be nice. I love you, G-ma. Mm-hmm. I guess it's time. Hey, Pretty Boy, come here. What's up? You nervous? Nah. Hey, look at me. It's good to be nervous. Yeah. This is our one move. We take Nefarious out, it's a whole new world. Everything changes for us. This is how we make do. This is how we take care of our own. But, hey, it's got to be done right. You with me? Yeah. Live together, die together. Live together, die together. I love you, bro. I love you. Let's do this. Ready to do this? Let's do this, baby. I wanna ask you a question that was asked of me late last night. Simple question, but one that rocked me to my core. It affected me so deeply, so profoundly, it could only have come from the Holy Spirit. The question I was asked was: "Do you believe in the cross of Christ?" I mean, that's a simple one for me to answer. Of course I do. The bank is open for business. And yet, when I got home last night, I couldn't sleep. It was that question that caused me to revisit the true meaning of the cross. Well, then, what does it mean to believe? True biblical belief requires action, so if you truly believe that Christ died so that we may live, it should not only bring you to your knees, but also bring you to your feet. The cross is a gift, and it was paid for with blood. But that's blood that my sins and your sins require as the price of our ransom. Come on! Get out now! Come on, K. My sin that separated me from God died with Christ on the cross. Come on! - You seen Nefarious? - What? Did you see Nefarious? Nah! What about Little B and 40? That's the price of doing business, brother. Go, man, go! 1 John 4:4 says we are overcomers. "He who is in me is greater than he who is in the world." Get us out of here! Yo, we trapped, man! Get out! Get out, man! P.B.! Get the money, man! Freeze! Let's see your hands! Get on the ground! Stop! Police! Stop! Stop now! And his spirit in us gives us all believers the power over the temptations of this world. The cross of Jesus Christ promises to love you, forgive you, and give you a new life right now. Hold it right there! We all, as captives, are free from the bondage of this flesh. You know, he's saving a seat up there for you. Nah, I ain't staying. Are you sure? I think you should. Man, you don't know me. Yes, I do. I've been where you're going. Believe me, the only way out you're ever gonna find is right in there. Listen to me. Listen. He's always been there waiting for you. For you. But you have to choose to take the first step that'll change your life. The Bible also says in Romans 6:23, "The wages of sin is death." And because we are all sinful-- Right there. It is a death we all deserve. Guess what? The cross offers us a way out, the only way out. You come to the cross by way of repentance. It means to change the way you live, to turn away from your sins. Now, maybe there's somebody out here tonight, somebody who desperately-- somebody who desperately wants to know God's love. Please, Lord, save me. Somebody who's tired. Lord, please. Somebody who's lost. Somebody who wants to be saved. I'll change my ways, I promise. Just please save me right now. If that's you, I want to encourage you right now, right now, just open your heart and very simply, ask Jesus to forgive your sins. And I want to challenge all of us tonight. Take out your cross and let it be a reminder of the amazing gift that Christ has given us. Because this is not just a symbol. It is not just an ideal. It is the way; it is the truth. And if you believe it's the truth, let your light shine. Take up your cross and show it! Why'd you do it? Do what? You know. The truth? The Holy Spirit put it on my heart that you were in trouble. Asked me to help. Man, you expect me to believe that? Doesn't matter if you do. You're still here, aren't you? Speaking of which, I kinda gotta lock up, son. Yeah, it's P.B. You know what to do. Repeat, dispatch. We have a 41 -year-old male with his legs and lower torso trapped under a storage tank. This is a priority one, requesting immediate air evac. Copy, 81. Stabilize in place. Stand by for flight assistance. ETA 30 minutes. We don't have 30 minutes. I need heavy rescue here now. Be advised, Air Med One is en route to Kenosha, and Air Two is grounded for electrical problems. Have fire set up an LZ, will you? You bet. I don't-- I don't want to die. Help me. Listen, I'm doing everything I can, okay? Can you tell me your name? Ron. Ron. All right, hang in there, Ron. All right, there's a lot of good people here and they're here for you. I'm scared. I know, but I'm right here with you, okay? I can't feel anything. What's gonna happen to me? Take this. What is it? Do you believe in God, Ron? No. I mean, I don't know. I can promise you this. He loves you, he knows you, and he suffered and died on the cross so we could be forgiven. Forgiven? Absolutely. If you believe and accept him, Jesus Christ, as your Savior. Ma'am, it's not safe. That's my husband! Dear God, please protect my family and my children. Forgive me. I am sorry. I am--I am so sorry. I-- Jesus. No. What's this? What is this? Great, now all we need is some cereal. Oh, Mom, is this cereal? Yeah. Good job, sweetie. Mommy, look what I found. Honey, put that back. I wasn't gonna take it. Right, but that's somebody else's money. We don't touch that. Put that back, please. Okay. Room service. You don't sound so good. I'm okay. Is anyone hungry? Sure. Come on in. Joe, guess what? We found your money jar. Lily, I told you to put that back! I told you I wasn't gonna take it. I'm so sorry. We just were looking for cereal and we found it, but she didn't take any. We're not that kind of people. It's okay. That's a lot of money. You should probably hide it better. Maybe I should. Although, it's not the money I really care about. Cool! An angel! Where'd you get it? I made it as a reminder. A reminder for what? That the angels are always watching over us. Here. Now, what do you say we eat? Heck yeah! What are you doing? Something we should've done a long time ago. Put it back. What's the matter with you? Teri, Kathleen is gone. She's not away at college or working in Minneapolis. She's not coming back for Christmas. I know that, J.D, but this is my daughter's room. This is all I have left. This is not a room, sweetheart, it's a museum. We're not honoring her memory, we're living in the past. What else are we supposed to do? Teri, the world didn't end when she died. Ours did. No, it didn't. We wanted it to, but it didn't. And ever since, we've been selfish. We've turned our grief into our most prized possession. God doesn't want that. Where was God the night we lost Kathleen? I'll tell you where he was. He was asking that man not to take another drink, begging that bartender not to serve it to him. He was hoping he'd call a cab, go home with a friend, anything but get behind that wheel. And when it was all over, he cried, just like we did. Why are you doing this, J.D.? Why now? Sweetheart, you know how Matthew said that belief is an action? Well, it's time for us to act. We've got to get back up and start living again. I want to do more with the time I've got. There's a whole world of people out there who need help, who have no place to stay. And every time it rains, they sleep wet. And every time it's cold, they sleep cold. You're turning our whole life upside down because of a sermon? No, no. I've been thinking about this for a long time. That sermon has given me the courage to actually do something about it. Harry died when she was just 4. Sometimes I'm afraid she's not even gonna remember him. When he died, it was just-- it was so hard. I just wasn't prepared for that much pain. It was like the bottom just dropped out and I just couldn't right myself. And, you know, I was, like, a stay-at-home mom so I had to get a job, and I did. But I had a really hard time finding people to take care of Lily. And the hours were not good, and so I was late to some of my shifts, and then I guess I didn't show up once or twice 'cause my headspace was all, you know. So, they fired me. So, after that, I did everything I could and I borrowed from everyone I knew. But then that day came, and I'll never forget it. We're walking down the street, holding Lily's hand, we come to our building, and all of our stuff, our entire life, is out there on the sidewalk. Clothes and dishes and Lily's toys, they were just-- it was a Wednesday. I hate Wednesdays. Yeah. I guess I never really thought about how it happened, you know, to people. But there I was one day without a home. Sure wasn't the way I thought things would end up, I'll tell you that much. Hey, it's not over yet. Take it from someone who knows. God has a way of making bad things...good. What? You don't believe? In God? Why would he take him away from us? Leave her without a dad and with a mom who can't even take care of her most basic needs? I mean, my husband brought us to church every Sunday and look at where we are. So you're saying that this isn't the best cup of coffee you've ever had? Well, it is-- it is pretty darn good. See? Things are looking up already. And with a little girl like that, you're doing something right. Okay, well, thank you. We should go. You know, you really don't have to go. Thanks, Joe. I mean, I really appreciate everything, but I can't have her staying someplace she can't stay for good. You know, she just gets used to it and it's just too hard. I'm sorry. Thanks. You're welcome. That was very sweet of you. Thank you. Come on, baby. Bye. Hi, Daddy. Um, I miss you. I was thinking that maybe I could come see you guys, or maybe you could come visit me or something. Well-- I know, but you said that-- you said that you were coming up here. You know-- you know she doesn't like me. I don't really like her, either, but I'm trying. Please, just can-- I just want to see you. Please? I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. I'm not. I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Daddy? So, are we still on for our little weekend? If my deposition doesn't run late. Why can't you just go to dinner anymore without being proselytized? Jesus was a carpenter, not a chef. If you want to thank someone for your food, there's the kitchen staff. I actually know her. She works at the hospital. Well, how about you don't let it ruin your dinner? Sorry. No, you know what? I'm not sorry. I'm the one who saves these people, and who do they thank when they wake up? "Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord." Yeah, I get it. I grew up with these people. But you, you've got a God complex. No, I don't. This is not a complex. I do his work, I should get the credit, at least some of the time. Wow. Carlos. Carlos. You're choking me! Get off me! What's wrong with you?! What happened? Daddy? It's okay, honey, it's okay. It's okay, buddy. Go back to bed. I hurt you. This was a mistake. I knew I shouldn't have came here. Carlos! Carlos! Elena! He's upset. You're upset. That's what happens. It's not good for you or the boys. Elena, he's right. It's better that I'm not here. That's not what I said, Carlos. It's okay, man, I get it. You have no money or anything. I'm fine. I don't need it. You can't just disappear like that again. I need to know where I can find you. Stop worrying about me, okay? I'll be fine. No, no, I'm not taking your money. I'm not gonna take-- No, I'm not taking your money. I'm not taking your money. Okay, but let me give you something. Here, can you just take this, please? Promise you'll call. Bobby, chief wants to see you in his office. The widow was looking to file a complaint against the department. The charge'll be proselytization under color of authority. Well, what exactly does that mean? She'll claim you implicitly threatened to withhold necessary care from a dying man unless he accepted your religious beliefs. You know I'd never do that. And she wasn't even there. Look, we've got to defuse this thing before it gains traction, so you're gonna craft a carefully-worded apology explaining how you made a mistake in the heat of the moment and it'll never happen again. I'll help you draft it. I can't do that. Why not? 'Cause I'm not sorry for what I did, and if I wound up in the same situation, I'd do it again. It's my obligation as a Christian. But not before my professional duties as an EMT were complete. Look, Bobby, if you can't find your way to apologize, then the union is gonna have to distance itself from you. Your legal defense, as well as any damages, are gonna have to come out of your own pocket. You're gonna lose everything. Is that what you want? So the union's gonna defend you, right? No. They say I acted outside of my capacity. And if the union's seen as backing my actions, they'll be liable, too, so unless I apologize, they're cutting me loose. Apologize. I can't. Not for sharing Jesus with a dying man. And especially since they're looking to turn this into some kind of an example. So to prove a point, you're willing to risk everything? I'm not trying to prove a point. I'm trying to be faithful. And you were. The guy's safe in heaven now, thanks to you and Jesus. End of story. Sure, he is. What about the next guy? I spoke with Tom's friend, Steve Katz. He's willing to represent me, but he's asking for a retainer. Twenty thousand. Where are we gonna get that kind of money from, Bobby? We have one month's mortgage in your checking account and all of our cards are maxed out. I don't know, but I trust God'll provide a way. Bobby, we're not in church. I need to know where the money's gonna come from, especially when you insist on tithing on every nickel we make. Tell me. Where's it gonna come from? I can't do this anymore. What do you want me to do? Sign the statement. Apologize. Do whatever they want you to do. Or what? Or what, Elena? Yeah? You okay? Yeah, I'm cool, man, but-- but we lost Little B and 40, yo. I know. Like, they gone. I know. You got the money? Nah. You gotta find it, P.B. Nefarious made it out. You know he's gonna have his boys hunting us down. We need that money. All right, I hear you. Thank you. Have a good night. Hey! Hey! You okay? Yes. You? For some reason, I expected a little more privacy. Yeah, me too. You want to grab a cup of coffee? Sure. So, Carlos, why didn't you do it? You know, like-- It? I met someone. Okay. How about you? Mmm, I don't know. I think I'm still in the beginning stages of feeling sorry for myself. Yeah. So, you some kind of religious nut or something? No, no, hardly. My sister gave me this. Her husband got saved a couple years back, and so Elena, she-- that's my sister-- she, I don't know, think she's, like, half saved, or five-eighths. I don't really think it works that way. No, it doesn't. What's funny is that I kind of feel like this is what kept me on that bridge. Then I met you. You're not God, are you? No. Nuh-uh. If I was, I would change a lot of things. Really? Mm-hmm. Like what? Like puppies would be puppies forever. Everybody would have somebody. Like, parents would really be there for their kids and fathers wouldn't abandon their children. Just stuff like that. Well, you got my vote. What about you? What would you change if you were God? No more war. No more killing. That's really heavy. Well. And what about you, yours? Talking about dads, not leaving their kids behind or whatever. Fair enough. Hi. Hi. I'm Grace. I'm Matthew's wife. Yeah. I'm the one who turned you away the other night. Look, it's not right that you should be staying here alone. Look, I'm really sorry. Will you forgive me? Okay. Well, let's get you out of here. Yeah. Sure. That's it. Yo. You got the money? Yeah. Good. That's good. Bring it to me. Nah, I can't do that, big bro. Why not? 'Cause it's not right what we did, yo. What you mean, not right? Right now, right has nothing to do with it, brother. Bring it to me. P.B., don't make me come looking for you. I'm not messing around. So, have you had any prenatal care? No. My stepmom took me to what I thought was gonna be my first appointment. It wasn't 'til I got there that I realized they were looking to get rid of the baby. I felt it kick for the first time on my way into the clinic. It's like the baby was telling me not to let them do it. Just couldn't get that feeling out of my head. I just realized that everything they were telling me was wrong and I had to get out of there. That's why I ran away. Oh, green beans? Would you like some corn? Here you go. Have a nice day. Is this your first time volunteering? Yes, it is. And the last. Just keep serving, sweetheart. Would you like some mac and cheese? None for me, thanks. It's 'cause the lactose. It doesn't agree with her. Is that so? Yeah, but I'll have some of hers. I'm a big fan of cheese. You sure know a lot about food. Yeah. I know about a lot of stuff. I'm Lily. Well, pleasure to meet you, Lily. I'm J.D. This is my wife Teri. You know, it's about time for our break. Mind if the two of us join you? Sure, if it's okay with my mom. She gets a little weird about strangers. Yeah, that'd be fine. Thank you, it'd be lovely. See you guys over there. Well, thanks for letting us join you. Sure. You're welcome. Well, for what we're about to receive, and the gift of our two new friends, may the Lord make us truly grateful. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Do you always pray before your food, Mr. J.D.? Yes, I do. Me too, even when they run out of beds in the shelter and we have to sleep outside in the parking lot. Sleeping in the parking lot? Huh. Well, that sounds like fun. Sort of like camping. No, it's not really camping. We have a car. Mom calls it the orange dork mobile. The orange dork mobile? Well, that was quite nice, wasn't it? I thought they would look different. You mean like orphans from a Dickens novel? Something like that. Hey, hon. Hot date? New client. The wife of an accident victim. Ambulance chasing, not quite your style. It is when the victim is forcibly converted to Christianity while he's trapped dying. Forcibly? Meanwhile, his wife is restrained out of earshot by the police. Picture this: a Bible-thumping EM has poor Ron Carson as his captive audience, painting him pictures of hellfire and damnation in his final moments. Isn't that kind of what they do? Maybe he was a believer, too, and she just didn't know it. Both were members of the American Humanist Association. Their motto is: "Good Without God." I like it. But it still kind of seems like her word against his. That's the best part. These Christian types, you swear them in, they put their hand on the Bible, they actually tell the truth. Imagine that. Hi, G-Ma. Where is your brother? I don't know. Come on over here. My Pretty Boy. You know, when you were just a baby, I would sing you to sleep. Every night, the same song. I remember. Amazing grace How sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me I once was lost But now I'm found Was blind, but now I see Now you listen to me. You are not blind. You are not lost. You got voices pulling you in all different directions, but there's only one voice that matters. You listen for that, you follow it, and you will be just fine. So, how long have you two been married? Matthew and I have been married for 11 years. Can I ask why you haven't had children? It's okay. I can't. There's this really long, boring explanation, but it all just boils down to that I can't. Of course, we thought about adoption, but I don't know. It's just--I really feel like a mother should be there when her baby is born, you know? Hey, hon. Hi. Hey. Surprise. You know, you can't go just handing these things out and not expect things to happen. You're amazing. Oh, man, those onions-- they are, whew, getting to me. Yeah. Except this is celery. This is an onion. Mm-hmm, you're right, but it's not cut. What are you doing? I'm gonna go get 'em. Now? Yes, now, while it's cold and wet and raining. Here, baby. I want you to be warm enough, okay? Yeah. Your fever's gone. Mommy, we're leaking again. We are. Wait, I won't let it get on you, okay? Okay. I miss Joe. I understand. Mommy, could you read me a story? It's too dark, baby. That's okay. You just make one up. Samantha? It's J.D. What do you want? Well, I'd like to offer you a place to stay out of the weather. How did you find us? Your daughter, she mentioned you slept out here sometimes, and with the rain, I knew the shelter would be jammed. So, I looked around for an orange dork mobile and there you were. Just because we're on the street doesn't mean that I'm a bad mother. That thought never crossed my mind. Look, I don't mean to appear ungrateful, but I need to know what's going on. Well, that's fair enough. See, my wife and I, we had a daughter of our own once, but we lost her. We haven't felt anything since then but her loss. Truth be told, well, we need this more than you do. I really appreciate what you're doing for us. Oh, don't you mention it. It's our pleasure, right, hon? Look, a dollhouse! Lily. This was our little girl's room. I put fresh linens on the bed. Thank you, darling. Thank you. Don't worry. It'll be okay. Just make yourself comfortable. We won't get in your way, and we'll be very quiet when we leave in the morning. Well, if it's all the same with you, we'd like you to stay. That is, if you like it here. We'll see. Thanks. Good. Well, that's fine with us. Good night. Good night. Can I call them Grandma and Grandpa? Not yet, baby. We need to see if this works out. Well, but they like us, don't they? I mean, isn't that why they brought us home? Well, they were gonna bring somebody home. It just happened to be us. I think we should thank Jesus anyway. Come on, Mommy. I like being able to sleep in a bed and not be afraid to go to the bathroom. You're right, Lilypad. Thank you, Jesus, for being so good to us, for watching over us, and for always taking care of us. What do you want to thank Jesus for, Mommy? You have to tell him. For you, baby. For you. What's up, man? Look who it is. Welcome back. Thank you. Wow. There's something different about you. Yeah, well, a lot's changed. What can I do for you? I'm looking for the guy who runs this place. Well, that would be our Father, and he would be in heaven, but I think you mean Pastor Matt. Yes. Follow me. Welcome home. Thank you. Pastor Matt? This is Percy. It's Pretty Boy. Thanks, Joe, I got it. Uh, nah. I want you to stay. Thanks for seeing me like this, Pastor. Sure. How can I help? Well, listen, the other night, this guy saved me. I mean, Jesus saved me, but this guy was definitely part of his plan, same as you. When I heard you talk that night, it's like I knew you was talking to me, even though you didn't know you was talking to me. What I'm trying to say is this: I asked the Lord to save me and he did. Which means this ain't mine no more. I want to do good with it, 'cause up until now, all it's done is bad. I want this bag to help people, to change them like it changed me. I--I can't take that. Man, this is a bag full of money. What's wrong with you? Hey, take it easy. Listen, last night I was reading on when Jesus got killed. That Judas guy, he gave the money back to the church, but they couldn't keep it, so they did something else with it. The way I see it is like this: the money is sin, and the wages of sin is death. So me holding on to this money is like me asking for death, but not just dying. More like hell and damnation. You have been reading. Well, yeah. I kind of stole this from the motel last night. That's all right. That's what they're for. Would that I were Solomon. If you were who? Solomon. He was the wisest of men. He knew how to solve the most difficult problems. This don't seem that difficult to me, and if your boy is as wise as you say, he would take this money. Well, maybe you're right. Maybe he would take it. And he'd give it away. Word. Only one way to find out. All right, you know. Yeah, it's gonna be cold, man. Whoa, Ski, Ski, Ski. Is that Pretty Boy over there? You got to be kidding me, man. He got some nerve. What, does this man have a death wish or something? He has to. Yo, Kriminal. You ain't gonna believe this, man. We seen Pretty Boy walking out the church. Church? What church? The one on 17th. You know, my aunt got saved by one of those TV preachers when we was kids. Want to know what was the first thing she done? Mm-mm. Gave that man on TV every dime she had. So you're saying-- Sheep follow the shepherd. I'm guessing the shepherd's got my money. This is gonna feel a little cold. Okay. Are you ready to see your baby? Yes. Okay, does that feel okay? Mm-hmm. You're gonna be great. That's your little girl. She's beautiful. She is. You're gonna do great. It's gonna be okay. Congratulations. Thanks. Welcome back to "The Lily Show" on how to do gymnastics. Get ready for the world's greatest handstand, into a back bend, into a somersault, into a cartwheel, into a one-handed cartwheel, into the splits! That was awesome. Thank you. That was so impressive. Thank you very much. Wow, she's so pretty. Yes, she was. I'll try not to remind you of her too much. Oh, sweetheart. Listen, you just be yourself and everything's gonna be okay. Okay. Bravo, bravo. Where you going? Preliminary hearing. The union wants to hear my side of the story. Have you decided what that's gonna be? The truth. Which truth? The one that's gonna keep you working, or the one that's gonna get you fired? I didn't know there were different versions to choose from. Amor, I'm gonna ask this one last time. Please don't do this, Bobby. I don't have a choice. What do you mean you don't have a choice? You're making one. You've been making a lot of choices lately. What does that mean? Bobby, you started going to church without even asking me how I felt about it. We talked about that. We talked about it, but you decided that. You did it on your own. You risk your life every day for strangers, Bobby. What about us? What about me, Bobby? You're about to throw everything away, but, hey, you have no choice, right? I am trying to do the right thing here. At least think about the kids. Will you do that? Just think about the kids. I am thinking about the boys and how I want them to behave when they become men. Well, it looks like you've made up your mind. I hope it all works out, Bobby. What made you want to become a Marine? Honestly, the billboard. What? Yeah, when I was a kid, I used to see it. I'd see the uniform and the sword. Just looked cool? Listen, if I could've been the first 8-year-old marine, I would have. I love being a Devil Dog. What happened? Things changed. Or you got tired of being a hero? Yeah. You know, the funny thing about war, it shows you who you are, not who you want to be. You could talk to me if you want. One morning, we're near this place called Shebesha, about 11,000 feet up on this mountainside, about to get overrun. Then out of nowhere, this chopper just comes down the valley, chain gun blazing. And they're there to get us out of there. It turned out, the pilot was actually a really good buddy of mine. Sam, this big ol' Korean guy. Always smiling. Always smiling, man, even then. Anyways, just shy of the perimeter, an RPG found them, took them down. Copilot, crew chief, they were both gone right away. But Sam, he was stuck up in the cockpit. I wanted to save him. I mean, he came to save me, but I was too scared. And he died. And now I just see it over and over and over. I don't know, maybe I deserve it. My punishment. No. I don't know what you did or didn't do over there, but I know that you saved me. So, that counts for something. I don't know how I saved you. I didn't do anything. I'm here. All right, what do we got? Fever is 104.6. He's burning up. Any conditions I should know about? Yeah. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Stage four. What's the name of your oncologist? Dr. Emil Martenek. Statesville Correctional Center. So I assume that means you're on compassion leave? What kind of treatment you been getting since you were released? Mostly praying. I did come in the other night, but I didn't get treated, so I ended up sleeping outdoors. Well, let's lay you down. You're living on borrowed time with a highly compromised immune system, and you decide to spend the night outside. It's complicated. There's an infection roaring through your body and it's highly unlikely I can stop it. I'm gonna admit you, make you comfortable. That's about all I can promise. It's okay, doc. I knew it was coming. Well, your little camping adventure probably shaved your time from a few weeks down to a couple of days, if that. It was worth it. Now I'm going downstairs. Down, down, down, down. I guess I can do it for myself. Okay. Hi. Yeah, can I help you? Actually-- Are you Samantha? Yes. This is for you and your little girl. From Joe. "Dear Sam, it looks like I'm gonna have to leave "and I don't think I'll be back this way. "The angel's for Lily. I want her to have it. God bless. Your friend, Joe." Oh, thank you. Hey, do you know where Joe is going? You don't know? Joe is dying. I dropped him off at the hospital this morning. Okay, I-- I'm sorry. Can you take me there? Sure. Yeah, yeah, my cab's right outside. Hey, you go ahead. Teri and I will feed her something and take her to the park for a couple hours. Thank you, J.D. Sure. Hey, hon. Hey, does that mean that she's having the baby? Okay, all right, I'll-- I gotta go. I'll get there as soon as I can. There's a young girl who's about to have a baby, right now, and I got to get her to the hospital. - Right now? - Yeah. Right now, you need to be worried about your future. My money. Your money. It's right here. I haven't touched it. Show it to me. Now what would Jesus think about you trying to take my money? I think he would know I didn't want it in the first place. So you believe in Jesus? I do. Then you believe that when I pull this trigger, you're gonna see him. I do. I believe we all will, sooner or later. Well, pray for me, Pastor, for hoping that you're wrong. Oh, thank you, God. Bobby Wilson, right? Yes, may I help you? You might not want to. I'm the attorney for Lauren Carson, the widow of Ron Carson. Can I ask you a question? Anything I can do to stop you? In a few minutes, you're gonna go in there, the union, the department, the city, and the county are gonna look to hang you, and you're gonna let 'em do it. That's about the size of it. And after that, I am gonna take you for everything you own. And you're still gonna go through with it? Yes. Why? I was once asked, "If you were ever accused of being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?" I don't know, maybe. But if what I did has suddenly become a crime, then I'm proud to plead guilty. I shared my faith with a dying man. It's something I've done for years, only no one's ever cared about it until now. Times change. People who are smart change with them. I didn't fail your client's husband. Medically speaking, I did everything I could. I did my job. Off the record? I don't really care. Then why? For me, it's about money. For my client, it's about hurting you. And for all of us, including the city, it's about stopping people like you from pushing their beliefs on others. I don't expect you to understand that. There's one thing that you should know if you don't already. This cross is gonna cost you. Mr. Wilson, they're ready for you. Thank you. See you in there. Told ya. Hey there. Hi, Joe. I'm so sorry. I didn't know that you were-- Dying? Everyone's dying. I'm just at the head of the line. Thank you for coming. Isn't there anyone else you want to be here? Friends? Don't really have any, unless you count my pastor. I figure he's already done enough. How about family? No. Not anymore. A long time ago... ...I had a family. I had a little girl. She was about Lily's age. I loved her so. And then I went and got myself in trouble. By the time I got back, she was all grown up with a life of her own. She didn't need her daddy anymore. Not that I'd been much of one, anyway. That was my Lily, my little angel. I guess that's why I took such a liking to you and your Lily. Selfish, I suppose. That's not selfish. It's human. Are you scared? No. Jesus has a soft spot for sinners, so I figure I'm all set. He loves you, Samantha. He really loves you. You'll see, someday. But how can you be so sure? Because he's God. I wish there was something that I could do. There is. What? Could I see Lily one last time? Sure. I can do that. Thank you. Hey, you hungry? 'Cause I make a really awesome peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I'm just saying. I'm sure you do, but think it's better if I go. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I just think I should go. What's wrong? Nothing. It's not you, okay? I can't do this. I--honestly, I can't remember what it's like to feel anything but shame. Then let me help you. That's it, that's just it. I can't be helped. But I want to help you. Us meeting, that wasn't a mistake. No, it wasn't. But eventually it will be. You don't know that. I do. Please don't do this. Please, I'm asking you, don't do this. I'm sorry. Look, look, listen. I really care about you, okay? I really care about you, and that's why I got to go. I'm too broken. We're all broken. Come here. Listen, I'm gonna go, okay? I'm gonna go. Well, look who it is. Prodigal son returned. What's up, big bro? You got my money? I don't. Trick question, P.B. I went and got it myself. What about Pastor Matt? Did you touch him? Too late to know now if I did. But, nah. He's still vertical. What's the matter with you, P.B.? After everything we've been through, all that I done for you? Live together, die together. And now you gonna go steal from me in front of everyone! Man, it's not like that. Then what is it? You found Jesus and what? Suddenly, you think you better than all this? Man, I see things differently now than I saw before, and I'm trying to share that with you. Don't you get it? Okay, so you trying to save me. We all need to be saved. And your Jesus is gonna do that? He died for us all, so that we could be saved, yeah. Yeah? Well, I wouldn't die for him. Why'd you come back here? You know what I got to do. Or what? You just thought I was gonna forgive you? I'm already forgiven, but just not by you, K. See, you want to forgive me, so we can go back to do what we did. But Jesus forgave me, so we ain't got to. And neither do you, man. That's what I'm trying to tell you. We don't have to be who we were. Shut up about Jesus, P.B. I can't and I won't. He loves you, Keshawn. What? Did you forget about me? No! No, man! P.B., P.B., come on, man. You aight, hold on. Percy, Percy! P.B., come on, player. Come on. Percy! Wake up, man! Come on, man! Get up, man. Stay with me. Stay with me. You alright, man. You alright, man. You aight. What you want me to do? Tell me what to do. Tell me what to do. Believe. No! Percy. Percy! Percy, wake up! Hold on. Thanks for stopping. So, where are you going to? Anywhere. They say that you're God. Please show me. We're almost there. I think there's something wrong! Can't you get us there faster? I'm going as fast as I can. You're doing great. I'm so excited for you to meet Joe. He's a super cool dude. But you do know he's really sick, right, sweetheart? Yeah, that's the sad part. But don't worry, I've been praying for him. We're almost there. Hang on, hang on! You guys okay? Watch out, J.D. What happened? Nothing, honey. It's just an accident. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Mommy! It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay. Now, listen to me. Can you open your door, so you can climb out carefully? It's stuck! We've got to get her out of the car. Just please get here as soon as you can. This baby's not gonna wait! There's too much blood, Matthew. There shouldn't be this much blood. We need to get her to the hospital. We can't wait for them to get here. There's no time to get to the hospital. This baby is coming. I can see her head. I can't do this. Stop the truck. Stop the truck! I'm gonna get you out, okay? Maggie, you're doing great. You're doing great. Keep it up. Good, good. Push! Push! Now you should cover your face, and turn away! Come on, we got to get you out of here. Wake up. Wake up! Come on. I got you. Quick, give me your hand. Give me your hand. Come on. No, I'm scared! I don't want to! It's all right. Come on, I got you. It's all right, Lily. Just go with him. Come on, come on. That's it. Wait, my angel! Okay, come on, get your angel. Come here! Hold on! Hold on! I need some help here! I need help! Someone help! You okay? You okay? Get over here! Please! Hang on! Anybody help! Help me! We need help! Take her. That's it, that's it, that's it! Matthew? Is my baby okay? She's beautiful. Come on. Get her, get her. Come on, you're next. Come on. I'm not leaving you, J.D. And I'm not asking you to. Now, you go on. I'll be right behind you. We got to go, Carlos! We got to go! If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do this now. Come on! - I love you. - Go. Please, ma'am, we gotta go! Come on. There you go. You're gonna be okay. Come on, let's go. No, you're finished here, son. My leg is broken. You go now. Maggie? You've lost a lot of blood. Remember how you said you wanted to be there when your child was born? I think you just were. No way. I'm not leaving you behind. Come on. Bobby! His leg's broken. Help me pull him out. That's it. Let's go, there you go, that's it. Pull! Come on. Easy. Come on. Go, go, go. Hang on! Tell me it's not just a lie. Tell me I'm gonna see Jesus. I've accepted him into my heart. Just promise me he'll accept me too. With all my heart, I promise you. He will. I got you! Come on, Bobby, come on. Thanks, bro. Thanks. Don't mention it. Maggie? Maggie. Joe? Lily's on her way. I want to thank you, Sam. My whole life, I've been afraid of dying alone. Thank you for believing in me. Joe... I'm sorry. Me too. Grab my Jeep. Meet at the hospital. Sounds good. Why did you save me? "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you." Thank you, Bobby. I'll be praying for you, Andrea. What time did you call it? 23:17. Cause of death: unidentified staphylococcus septicemia. Contributing causes: stage four pholymphocytic leukemia. Is there anything I can do for you? No, thank you. No. You came back. What happened? Doctor? Doctor, there's something you need to see. Joe Phillips. The one whose certificate I just signed? Did I miss something? You could say that. I don't understand. He's been dead for what, like, 8 minutes? All right, Joe. How do you feel? Amazing. Run a full panel. CBC blood cultures, the works. I want an accurate identification of what this infection is. Yes, doctor. Doc, you're not gonna find anything. It's a miracle. It is. There's no such thing as miracles. Do you have a better theory, doctor? Not yet. "For though they have eyes, they will not see. For though they have ears, they will not hear." Whatever this is, the answer isn't in the Bible. Okay, doc. But the man whose death certificate you just signed is sitting right here, talking to you, and you don't wanna believe in miracles? I'm just saying, you might want to reconsider. That's a nice thought, Joe. I'm glad you're awake. I get a second chance. You want to grab a coffee, on me this time? You came back! He brought you back to me. Are you okay? I think so. Yeah? Come on. What happened? It's a long story. We've got him. Hey. What are you doing? Praying. More like apologizing. Tonight I saw a miracle, a real live miracle. And it made me realize how I was acting, like the God who did that somehow wouldn't be there for us. I felt so ashamed. No. I don't want to live my life like this anymore. I want to give all of my life to Jesus. No more holding back. I'm the one who should be apologizing. I spent so much time sharing my faith with other people, I somehow lost sight of you. Forgive me. Deal. Want to pray with me? Gladly. Mommy! Lily! Baby! Oh, I was so worried about you. So worried! Are you okay? Yeah, we had a little accident, but I'm fine. I'd say so. Hey, I think somebody over there might like to see you. Joe! Hey, my little butterfly. You're looking better. Thank you. Look, I brought your angel back to you. Yes, you did. But you keep it. It's for you now. You're right. They are watching over us. Yes, they are. Yes, they are. Have I told you I love you? Every day for 44 years. Just wanted to make sure. You know I lost my favorite ball cap? Aw, we can get another one. Hey, how you doing? You all right? Actually, no. I'm not. Let's have a look. What kind of person would risk his life for someone who just finished ruining him? I honestly don't know. I think I was wrong, Thomas. And I think you were too. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Maybe I'm the one with the God complex. Come on, you know what? Maybe we should just get out of here. No,we shouldn't. I'm not sure any of us ever gets to see the whole picture, the God's eye view, so to speak. It's like we're little children, sitting on the floor, gazing up at the back side of a tapestry that's being woven. To our eyes, it sometimes looks ugly. The colors are a jumble and none of it makes much sense. - Hey! - Hey. - Hey, Joe. - How's the leg? Eh, gets me out of raking leaves. I want to thank you for taking them in. Oh, we're blessed to have them. We're one big family now. See, Mommy? God really does love us. He does, baby. He really does. But one day, we'll no longer be sitting on the floor. We'll come around to the other side, and the genius of God's handiwork will become clear. At the center of it all, we'll see the cross. Are you the one that calls himself Kriminal? I was. But in that immense tapestry, we'll also see the single unique thread, the only one of its kind and color, that our own life has added to the piece, the one thread without which the whole thing would somehow be incomplete. Personally, I can't wait to see his masterpiece. So, let our faith be more than anthems Greater than the songs we sing And in our weakness and temptations, we believe We believe! We believe in God the Father We believe in Jesus Christ We believe in the Holy Spirit And he's given us new life We believe in the crucifixion We believe that he conquered death We believe in the resurrection And he's coming back again Let the lost be found and the dead be raised In the here and now, let love invade Let the church live loud Our God will say we believe We believe And the gates of hell will not prevail For the power of God has torn the veil Now we know your love will never fail, we believe We believe We believe in God the Father We believe in Jesus Christ We believe in the Holy Spirit And he's given us new life We believe in the crucifixion We believe that he conquered death We believe in the resurrection And he's coming back He's coming back again He's coming back again We believe We believe Up to the hill of Calvary My Savior went courageously And there he bled and died for me Hallelujah for the cross And on that day, the world was changed A final, perfect Lamb was slain Let earth and heaven now proclaim Hallelujah for the cross Hallelujah for the war he fought Love has won, death has lost Hallelujah for the souls he bought Hallelujah for the cross What good I've done could never save My debt too great for deeds to pay But God, my Savior, made a way Hallelujah for the cross A slave to sin, my life was bound But all my chains fell to the ground When Jesus' blood came flowing down Hallelujah for the cross Hallelujah for the war he fought Love has won, death has lost Hallelujah for the souls he bought Hallelujah for the cross Hallelujah for the war he fought Love has won, death has lost Hallelujah for the souls he bought Hallelujah for the cross Hallelujah for the cross Hallelujah for the cross
