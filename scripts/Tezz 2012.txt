May I help you, please? Just a moment. Hello, this is the Railway Security Chief speaking. Hello. There's a bomb on London-Glasgow 112. If the speed drops below 60 the bomb explodes. Do not stop the train. Do not stop the train. Excuse me, sir. - Yeah? You are needed inside, urgently. Hi, guys. - Good morning. Hello, sir. - Hey, Radhika. How is your cold? - Absolutely fine, sir. We've a situation. Good morning, gentlemen. So, what's happened? There's a bomb threat. - Trigger station? London-Glasgow. Train 112. Did you say the London-Glasgow express? Radhika, there's a bomb threat on 112. The bomb can explode if its speed goes below 60. Perhaps someone is playing a prank. But I'm not taking any chances What? Okay, listen up, everyone. Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, listen up. There's a bomb threat on London-Glasgow Express, No. 112. I want each and every one of you to concentrate. Radhika, keep the track of 112 clear. - Yes. John, get me the driver on the line. Sir. You're needed inside, urgently. I told you there's a bomb on the train. If you think it's a hoax then... You... Give me the phone. Hello. Hello. Just rewind. Quickly. Stop. Play. - 'Lt's a hoax then... ' 'You... ' Hello. He's on line. Who are you? I just heard you abuse. Who are you? What do you want? Who are you? - My name is Sanjay Raina. Railway Traffic Controller. My name isn't more important than 500 passengers' lives. But your good sense could save their lives. Hence, listen carefully. If you this is a hoax then I have planted a similar bomb... ...on London Manchester Goods Train 509. It is currently running at the speed of 15m/hr. In a while the train will ascend. While ascending its speed will reduce by 5 miles. And the bomb will explode. If you want to save the drivers... ...then they should jump off it before the bomb explodes. Hello. A bomb. Come on, jump. All the exchange points that I am concerned about... Sir, he hasn't lied. Goods train just blew off. There was a bomb on that train. What about the drivers? Sir, they jumped off before the bomb exploded. But there were minor injuries. Find out the exact position and speed of the train. Fast. And John, I want the position of all the trains... ...coming in the opposite direction. Bring it over. - Yes, sir. Sir, it has just crossed Chelsea on the North Line. And the speed is 90m/hr. Good. Ask the driver to maintain the speed... ...and not to reduce it at any cost, unless I say so. - Sir. John, inform all stations, 112 will not be making scheduled stops. Okay, sir. Radhika, check all lines, crossings and signals. There shouldn't be any obstructions on the track. - Right, sir. Hi, sir. It's Richard speaking. Sir, I've got the train driver on the line. What's his name, John? Give me the headphones. - Richard. - Richard. Sir. - We have reason to believe there is a bomb on your train. We have no official confirmation yet. But we are not taking any chances, Richard. Richard. Richard. Richard, get a hold of yourself and listen to me very carefully. What is your speed right now? We should be reaching our next station in 20 minutes. We could stop and do checks there. No. No. No. No, Richard. You'll do nothing of that sort. If you reduce your speed to less than 60m/hr the bomb will go off. Do you hear me? Radhika, how long will it take to reach Glasgow at this speed? Sir, approximately 10 hours. Okay, Richard, now concentrate. You bring your speed down to 70m/hr. That will make yourjourney to Glasgow to about 12 hours. I'll speak to you later. Wish you luck. - Sanjay. Sanjay. This is Sanjay Raina. Our head traffic controller. Hello. - Detective Inspector Alan Fisher. Senior investigative officer. - Good morning. Has the bomber called again? - No, not yet. Well, he might. So, we need to be prepared. Where's the control room? Lt's this way, sir. Sir, sir. Excuse me, sir. Can I have a quiet word? Sir, we've an emergency situation. And this is an emergency joining call for you. When we go to Jammu we'll do a lot of shopping. You two will have to go to India alone. Why, is everything fine? There's an emergency, Alka. The department has called me to the office for an urgentjob. I am sorry, Alka. I think I will have to work for another day. Mamma was right. You can never retire. Why aren't we stopping? Are we supposed to be stopping here? How can this be? My ticket is valid to this station. Oh, this is ridiculous. Where's the train manager? Excuse me. Could you tell us what's going on? Yeah. Why haven't we stopped? Please, be calm. There is nothing to worry about. You sure passed our station without stopping. How can you tell me not to worry? Sir, please. Sit down. - No. No. No. Shut up ...and tell us what's going on. - Calm down. Calm down. Excuse me. Why didn't he tell us why didn't he stop? What's going on? This is Chief Inspector Shivan Menon, narcotics branch. Please open the door. Is there any problem? Yes, sir. The metropolitan police have confirmed a bomb blast... ...that occurred this morning on a Northern Railway. That a Manchester bound goods train exploded... ...this morning near York. I am currently standing outside Platform 10 at Euston station. That a similar bomb has been placed on... ...the London-Glasgow train Police suspect this is where the bomb was planted. Sir, is there some sort of crisis? Many trains have been stopped. Sir, there was a blast on 509... - No comments. Are all the tracks ahead of it clear? Sir, they are clear for the next three stations. But a lot of trains are getting delayed because of these diversions. There cannot be any issue greater than this, at the moment. See, I don't care. - Sir... Even if I've to cancel every single train in the whole of England. Excuse me, sir. Somebody's here to see you. - Yeah. If you do what I say... - Sir, but... Sir. Just do what I say. - Arjun Khanna. Counter Terrorism Command. Sanjay Raina. Railway Traffic Controller. I heard that you spoke to the bomber. - Yes. You handled the situation well, Mr. Raina. In spite of you talking to him he didn't stop the train. Otherwise police's job would have gotten easier. Sir. Excuse me. Mr. Raina, how long will it take the train to reach Glasgow? About 101/2 hours. - Yes, Miranda? These are the trains that were diverted to the south-east line. And which is this one? Lt's alright. Just give it to me. Who could it be? Not a terrorist. If he would've been one, he couldn't have called to inform. He would've called after the incident to claim responsibility. If he is not a terrorist then what does he want? Get me that. - You spoke to the bomber, Mr. Raina. It's yourjob to give me the details. - Fine. Was he an Indian or a Pakistani? I think an Indian. - Why do you think so? Because he was talking in Hindi and not Urdu. Which accent was he talking in? Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi? Look... - Sir. Sir, we have a huge problem here. Train 308 is on our track coming from the opposite direction. Oh, God. - We diverted all the other trains, except this one. How far is 308 from the other one? - We can't do that, sir. - Why? Because there are only two tracks in that area. And there is already a stopped goods train on that track. There should be an exchange line before the station. Ken, get me your aerial feed on the large monitor. Okay. This is our train. And on the same track And on this track there is just one exchange line. Sir, this is the maintenance line. You cannot change the track with the speed of more than 50m/hr. The train will topple. - Even I know that. But railways, as a safety precaution... ...sets the limits 15-20 miles lower. We'll have to take this turn at the speed of more than 60. We have to take that chance. - But sir... We have to take that chance, Radhika. How long it will take for our train to reach the exchange point? Three minutes. And 308? - Sir, five minutes. Sir... - If both the trains have to cross safely then... ...both have to reach their exchange point at the same time. Radhika, tell the driver of Are you sure, sir? - Just do it, Radhika. John, give me the headphones. Richard, hear me carefully. There's an inbound train coming your way. You have to reduce your speed to 65m/hr. Do it now, Richard. - But 65m/hr is too close to the trigger point. Damn it, Richard. You have to take that risk or it's over. Do it now. Kevin, you be on your toes. You make the change when they give you the signal. You hear me, Kevin? Three. Two. One. Now. Now. This is not yet the time to celebrate. This is just the beginning, guys. Please get back to work. Thanks. Thank you. Yes, Vikas? - Sir, I've checked the database of all Indian... ...and Pakistani history-sheeters. All of them are under the watchful eyes of our officers. I don't think he is one of them. - Okay. That means he's a new scoundrel. Okay, do one thing. Reach Railway's goods station. I'll meet you there. "Without you..." "Without you I feel restless." "I feel restless." "Without you..." "Without you I feel restless." "I feel restless." "You are my life." "You are my happiness." "You are my prayer." He's get a British citizenship if he marries you. And also be the proprietor of my wealth. And yet, you want to make him my son-in-law. Whether or not you make him your son-in-law... ...I surely want him to be my husband. Oh, shut up. What is his stature, after all? Father, show some respect. He's better educated than you are. He's an engineer. Nikita, if you want to spend your life with them... ...then you'll have to leave this house. Aakash, come on. "I swear. I swear, beloved." "I am... I am crazy about you." "How do I live?" "How do I live, tell me." "I can't die either." "I swear. I swear, beloved." "I am... I am crazy about you." "How do I live?" "How do I live, tell me." "I can't die either." "You are my life." "You are my prayer." "Without you... Without you I feel restless." "I feel restless." "How do I say it? Where do I go?" "Who do I worship?" "Who do I worship?" Excuse me. Manish Solanki. He's in Ward A, bed four. Okay. One moment. The payment has to be made before the operation. Sir, I have checked the entire CCTV footage. I couldn't see anyone. - Okay, when did the goods train come? Here, sir. On this track. This area, sir. Forceps. Vikas. I want the footage of the past 24 hours from this camera. Is this your bike? Yes, it is. - How many bikes do you have? Five in total. And all five of them were with you last night? No, three of them were with me. Two of them are in the garage getting repaired. Where's the garage? The Alfa point center. Over on Richard Street. Thank you. Railway Control Security. May I help you? I want Sanjay. Yes, its ready. Take it. Sanjay here. - Stay close to the phone... ...or this train won't stay close to the ground. Okay. What do you want? Old currency. Why this silence? You aren't paying from your pocket. Listen... - You have one hour. Yes, Vikas? - Sir, the bomber has asked for 10 million euros. Then the bomb will surely blow. The ministry won't pay up so easily. What's the ministry's take on it? They haven't taken any decision as yet, sir. Will they take a decision after the bomb explodes? Anyway, keep me posted. The smoke meter's diaphragm... Greetings. Welcome. What happened? Your car stalled? - Police. Look, sir, I will tell you. I am sure Mrs. Khanna must have lodged a complaint. Mrs. Khanna on purpose wears skimpy clothes... ...and passes by my window. I get compelled to whistle. I... How many people work in here? Here? Only six. Everyone has a permit. Everyone? - Two don't. It will come. I am trying. Where are they? - Here. Novice. Come here. Come here. Come here. Hurry up. Hurry up. Say hello to sir. - Hello. Where's the other one? The dark egg? Sir, he didn't come today. - He didn't? I look at their innocent faces and give them work and get trapped. Where were you last night? - I was with Mrs. Patil. My wife, sir. Where were you? I was here, at work, sir. - Alone? Tell him. - No, sir. Aadil was with me. - Who is Aadil? The one I told you about. The boy working without a permit. The other mechanic. - He was with you the entire night? Yes. No. He had left to test the bike. What time? At 10 or 11 pm. Which bike? - Chip Shop's owner's bike. Fish and chips' bike? - Yes. Yes, sir. Do you know Aadil? His whereabouts? Where does he stay? Do you have his address? Sir, he didn't have a permit. I just appointed him. So, now we don't have documents. One day you too will go to jail along with such boys. Vikas. Immediately send a sketch artist to Alfa Garage. We need a sketch of a boy named Aadil. Yes. - I guess we have got our guy. What? There's a bomb? What? A bomb on the train? - There's a bomb on the train. Listen, everybody. There's a bomb on the train. Oh, my God. - Are you sure? Sir... - It's all over the news. Everybody, there's a bomb on the train. - What? This... How did he come to know? Is there a bomb? Move. Move, you. Why did you hide it from us? Why didn't you tell us? Our lives are in danger and you hid this from us! Close the door. Shut the door. And get inside. Shut the door. Get inside. Leave him! Move! Don't push it. Go back to your seats and sit down. Everybody. Stop it. - You get off him. I'll blow your head off if you touch anybody. Okay? Go back to your seat. Go. Yes, there's a bomb on this train. We can't stop or even reduce the speed below 60m/hr. Or the bomb will explode. We can either panic right now and make things hard... ...or we can stay calm... ...and trust the government to get us out of this mess. The position of the British government... ...on terrorist acts is very clear. There will be no negotiation whatsoever. Let's make it official. All in favor raise your hands. Mr. Khanna doesn't seem to agree with our opinion. May I ask you exactly what do you have in mind? I think we should have the money ready. Sir, all I am asking you to is make the money visible. It will be a tool for me to negotiate. A way to get the boomer out in the open. It will be just a bait. And if you lose the criminal and the money? Sir... You've believed in me for 23 years. And I never failed to deliver. You called me back from retirement all because of your trust. Just trust me one last time. And I promise you, I'll not lose the money... ...or the passengers on the train. I'll get him. Sir, Aadil's sketch has matched. This is his file from the immigration department. Aadil Khan. He came here from India, 7 years ago, on a tourist visa, sir. With a music troupe. He neither went back nor did he ever get caught. Dispatch his photo and all his details to all the police stations. Bus stations. Police stations. Airports. Everywhere. Keep the police officers ready. - Yes, sir. What's the news on the train? The conductors have checked all the compartments. They didn't find any bomb, sir. This means the bomb isn't controlled by a lunatic. This bomb is now controlled by speed. Listen, Vikas. From Railway Control Centre take the details of the next bridge. I need 4- 5 high speed cameras under that bridge. I ant clear pictures of every compartment's base. Dear, I'm a little busy. Can I... - Daddy... Am I going to die? What are you saying, Pia? Everyone here is saying that there is a bomb in the train. Everyone is going to die. Nothing's going to happen to anyone. I am concentrating only on your train. I won't let anything happen to you. Promise? I promise. Excuse me, Dr. Renu. - Yes? Please report to the front desk. There's a telephone call for you. Okay. Hello. - Hello, Renu? Renu, don't hang up. Is Pia alright? Renu, Pia is on a train. And we've just got the news that there is a bomb in that train. Then stop the train and get Pia out. We cannot do that. Until I don't inform you anything about the train... ...don't believe in what anyone else says. I'll keep in touch. Okay? Got something for you, sir. One moment. Stop. Now rewind. Stop. Zoom. Bomb squad reports? - That way, sir. They say that the goods train too had a similar bomb. You see, sir, there is an electronic dynamo. It's sensor is attached to the wheel of the train. If the speed of the train goes below 60... ...the dynamo will activate the trigger and the bomb will explode. It's all mentioned here, sir. Under which compartments is the bomb placed? - Four and seven. Connect me to the engineering department. Send all the passengers in the first three compartments. Separate the rest of the compartments from them. I think that should work. - I don't think that's possible. What you are saying is impossible. Why is it not possible? Lf we switch off the main hydraulics of the train then... You don't understand. This train runs on an automatic system. If you switch off the hydraulics, the train will stop right there. And that bomb will explode. You mean to say there is no way to stop the train? There is no way you can stop that train... - If there was any... ...I would've stopped it. My daughter is on that train. My daughter is on that train. Hello. - Sanjay. Sanjay, my money? - It's ready. Do you have any idea of how many innocent lives... ...you are putting in danger? Lf you get caught you'll die. Why are you playing with your life? One shouldn't love life too much. In the end, everyone has to lose it. Look, I can help you if you have been wronged. You won't be able to catch me even if you talk for long. Give me my money... - Where do you want the money delivered? Who are you? - Arjun Khanna. Counter Terrorist Command. I'll get your money. Where should I get it? Mr. Khanna, put the money in a bag. There should be no tracking device in it. Nor should there be any officer with you. You should come alone. Till I don't get the money... ...no one will know the way to defuse the bomb. Glenalmond College. Surrey. In 20 minutes. Are you Mr. Arjun Khanna? - Yes, Father. Then I guess this belongs to you. A gentleman delivered it to us this morning. He said you'll be coming to collect it. Did you happen to see his face? Sorry, I didn't. He was wearing some kind of helmet. But he did seem to be in a great hurry. Hello. Mr. Khanna? Speaking. - Get into a car. Get out through the forth gate and take a left. Go straight and take another left. It will take you to an unpaved road. Keep driving. It was that scoundrel's call. Vikas, I'm calling you. You'll get this mobile's number. As soon as the bomber calls again... ...trace his exact location and tell me. I'm taking this car. Did you see "the inn" board? Yes. Turn right from there. Half a kilometer away you will see an "animal crossing" board. Take a left from there. Sir. Sir. Yes, Vikas. Tell me. Sir, the call got traced. What's the exact location? Alexandra, Bun No. 67 Hogway. Okay. Go for him and get him alive. I'll keep him busy. - Okay, sir. Come on, guys. Let's get inside. Let's move. Animal crossing road. Got it. I got it. Turn right. Hello. I can't see any Richards Farm's board here. Mr. Khanna, I guess you aren't paying attention. I think I'll have to hang up. Yes, I can see it. I can see it. This is the police. You've been surrounded. Slowly come out with your hands over your head. There is no other way out for you. Freeze. Don't take a wrong turn at any cost today. It can prove to be dangerous. Stop the car near the Rapid's board. He watches a lot of English movies. I'll have to give him that. Will you tell us what to do next. Get out of the car. By now you must have reached a riverbank. Yes. There, below a tree, there's a yellow waterproof suitcase. Got it? Keep the money in it. Now throw the suitcase in the water. I said, throw the suitcase in the water and walk away. I want all units to setup a two kilometer radius around this area. All highway routes should be blocked. No vehicle should be allowed to pass without being checked. Please go to shore. Please stop otherwise we will have to open fire. This is your last warning. Please stop otherwise we will have to open fire. This is your very last warning. Every time I think you cannot do anything more stupid... ...you prove me wrong. Who the hell do you think you are? Who told you to give in? How are we going to stop the train now? Hey, look, if you can't handle it, you should've left it to us. You are an amateur. It was an accident. You coming back was the accident. We needed him alive. The bomber is still alive. She was not the bomber. She? - Don't look confused. There's more than one person involved in this crime. So, how do you intend to proceed? What is the plan? That's for me to know and you to find out. As you know, Alan, that investigations are based on leads. And I have one. Vikas. - Sir. I got this hospital bill from that girl's pocket. Get all the details possible. And do this fast. We are running out of time. Stop. No. Please let me go. Let me go, please. Please. I have not done anything. What's happening? What's happening out here? Please, don't hand me over to the police. They will send me back to India. Please. It's my... It's a question of my life. Along with mine, my family's life will also get ruined. Please. Let me go. Please. I haven't done anything wrong. I'm scared for my life. Please, sir. Hello? Did everything go well, sir? Hello? Where are you? Where is Megha? Megha is dead. No. Oh, God. No. Aadil. - No! Aadil! Moments ago, a high speed chase on the M25... ...has resulted in the death of the London railway bomber. Authorities have said that the bomber, a female in her twenties... ...was trying to escape on her dirt-bike... ...and had a fatal accident during the chase with the police. Hello? - Hello, Sanjay? Sanjay, tell me the truth. Everyone here is telling me a different story. I had told you, no matter what anyone tells you about this train... ...don't believe in it. But in the news they are showing that the bomber is dead. That train won't stop. Media... Media has gone crazy. The bomber is a guy. He is still alive. And I am talking to him. I hope you are not saying so just to calm me down. Do one thing. Talk to her. You'll feel better. Hello? - Hello. Hello, Pia? - Mamma? Are you alright, dear? Yes. But how did you get my number? Your father gave it to me. You spoke to him? Yes, dear. Hello? The bomber is dead. It's all over. We are all going to die. I'm not going to die like this. I bet we can jump off this train. - Please sit down. How are you going to defuse the bomb if the bomber is already dead? The bomber is not dead. How do you know? My daddy is a chief of railway control centre. What's your name? - Pia. Pia Raina. Okay, Pia, what did your father say? He told my mother that the bomber is not dead. Can I talk to your father? I found sister-in-law's address. She's a teacher in some kindergarten school. I didn't get any other information. Megha's brother's operation was to take place today. Of what? He has started lose vision. Both his eyes. The operation is very expensive. And if he doesn't get it done, he can go blind. I think they have found out that we are Indians. Unit four, are you in position? In position, sir. Shall I go in? No. Hold your positions. Nobody approaches the target without my orders. Aadil, run. Hey. Hey, stop. - Stop. - No. Stop! Stop. - Stop. Come on. Stop. Stop. Stop! Come on. Come on. - Whoa, whoa. Come on. Stop. - There. Get him. Get him. Get him. Just kill him. Whoa, whoa. Oh! - Get him. Watch it, man. "Speed." "Speed." "Everybody... speed." "Speed." "Everybody... speed." "Speed." "Speed." Stop, or I shoot. Get down, everybody get down. I've got him. Clear the bridge. Clear the bridge. Stop. I said stop. Damn it. Drive. Good morning. - Good morning. Here. Have some sweets. Sweets? What are we celebrating? Remember, I had told you about my brother, Manish? He has got an admission in an engineering college here. Oh, that's nice. But how did he come to UK? He didn't come through illegitimate means like us, sir. He has come legally. He has got student visa. Then you deserve double congratulations. He'll be an engineer like me. This has been possible only because of you. You had done a lot of favors. My parents... - Enough. Enough. Enough. Give me the sweets. This is a routine check. Stay where they are. This is the UK Border Agency. Everybody stay where they are. Wait a minute. Sir, please. Plesae leave me, sir. Sir, people from the immigration department are outside. They are checking everyone's papers. What should we do? ...get away! Aadil. You leave with Megha. Sir, but you? I'll take care of them. You both leave. But, sir, you too. - Just stop it. I said go. Come on, Megha, let's go. Come on. Yes, officer. Is there a problem? My name is Peter Harvey from the Department of lmmigration. We've just been checking your workers' papers. And a few of them don't seem to have... ...the proper documentation to work in the UK. I guess I am not aware of that. What's yourjob here, sir? I am the CEO. - And who owns the company? My wife. - Can I see your papers, please? I have applied for my citizenship and work permit. I have a copy of that. - Sir, without citizenship... ...and work permit you cannot work in this country. I'm afraid you have to come with us. It's okay. It's okay. It's almost done. Just relax. May I know who he is? Someone who has nothing to lose. And you? Someone who has lost everything. Let's go. Thanks, Doctor. I think we should stop right here. Why? Our intention was to commit a crime and get our lives back. Without endangering anyone's life. Megha has lost her life. And you are injured. I don't want the money at the expense of your life. It's no use backing out now, sir. Megha is dead. And if I didn't have the hope that you would return... ...then I would've hanged myself long back. Who do we fear? Lf we don't win, what do we have to lose? And if we win, we have our lives ahead of us. Give it here. Yeah, Sanjay here. - Everyone in this world wants to go to heaven. But no one wants to die to go to heaven. Your mistake will today take those passengers to heaven. The deal is off. Have you gone mad? Who the hell do you think you are? When the government had given you the money... ...to give to the bomber then why did you have to act smart? You should have quietly given the money and defused the bomb. That money was a means to catch those scoundrels. Not to fulfill their demands. Now just calm down. - Now don't you tell me to calm down. I've been trying my best to save the train since morning... ...so that you get time for your investigation. A lot of time has been wasted, but the little hope that we had... ...you have ruined that as well. Mr. Sanjay, I understand. - No, you don't understand. Because you don't have anyone close to you on that train. Shut up. Everyone in that train has a near and dear one. I don't need a reason to save people's lives. It's my job. It's my duty. He will call back. Why will he call back? How do you know so? I'm telling you, he will call. - Why will he call? Because he won't leave without taking his money. - He will not call. It's him. - He will call. It's him. Hello. - Take the money and go St. Georges hall. And don't do anything stupid this time. Last chance. Excuse me, mister. This is for you. Who gave you this? Hey, listen. Put the bag in the trash can behind you. Keep an eye on the green dustbin. I repeat... Alpha Team, talk to me. No, sir. Nothing yet. Snipers. Keep an eye on the green dustbin. No fatal shots. I want this guy alive. - Okay. Here's your coffee, sir. - Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Sir, I've just seen something in his hand. Bravo Team, do you see anything? No sir, still looking. Nothing yet. He will come. We will see him soon. Target confirmed. Approaching drop point. Everyone, now, stay calm. Be focused. Be focused. Negative, sir. "Hey, everybody pay" "Hey days, days, days, p-p-pay" Can I have a word with you, please? They've found a suspect. That's his picture. 'Do you have the packages? ' 'What's the idea? - You'll know soon.' Stay back. Move. Move. Move. Hey. Where's the emergency brake? - I don't know, man. Calm down. Go ahead. You'll show me the emergency brake. Stay back. Move. Move. Move. Stay down. The emergency brakes have to be put on anyhow before any station. Where are the brakes? - There. Why aren't they working? The driver has jammed the brakes. Open up or I'll blow the door. If you got to shoot someone, shoot me. We got to get off this train. We got to get off this train. We got to get off this train. We are going to die. Shut up. - We are going to die. - Shut up. It's true. It's true. - What's true? I sold the explosives to him, okay? I saw him at the railway station. Saw whom? The bomber. You know him? - Yes. Who's he? His name is Aadil Khan. - Where does he stay? Hello? - Job's done. Yes. Yes. Yes. How are you feeling? Now I'm feeling great, sir. Okay, I'm coming. I will be back in five minute. Okay. Keep moving back. Back. - Keep moving back. - Back. Please. Come on. Move. - Move back. Move back. Move back. Second floor, rear window. Repeat... Hello. - Aadil, try leaving through the back door. No, sir. Police has surrounded the place. Then I'll come upstairs. Don't try to save me, you too will die. Then we will die together. Come on, move back. Please leave, sir. Just go. Get back. Get back. Team A, cover. Cover. Drop your weapons. You're arrested. Come out with your hands up. Come on immediately. Drop your weapons. You're arrested. Come out with your hands up lmmediately. If you move, you'll die. Me or we? The investigation strategy was to get the bomber alive... ...defuse the bomb and save the passengers. And what are you doing? Killing them one by one. Who the hell do you think you are? Dirty Harry? He blew himself up. It was a suicide. Oh, so, now, what do you suggest we do? Catch the real bomber. The man who has the money. - Yeah. The idea of the money was to use it as bait. Hey, he's lost all the money. He's killing all the bombers. He screwed up the whole operation. For all we know, he could be a part of the conspiracy. And gets his share of money when he gets back to India. What did you say? Another word and I'll break yourjaw. - Sir. I'll break yourjaw. - Sir. Sir. No, sir. Vikas, let go of me. Let me teach him a lesson. - Sir, please. Please. Stop. What does he think of himself? - Yes. Get him off me. - You foreigner! Let it be, Vikas, I will show him. - No, sir. Get him off me. - Sir, let it be. Leave me. - Sir. Let it be, sir. Listen to what he is saying. - Let it be, sir. Please. We are getting defamed because of such scoundrels. One man plants a bomb and because of that... ...his community and his country gets slandered. Today it's either me or the bomber. Sanjay here. There's a restaurant at Alford Lane. Delhi Darbar. There's a table booked in your name. You'll find an envelope on the table. It contains the instructions on how to defuse the bomb. "I am dew." "You are my dawn." "I am love." "You are my world." "I am the speaker." "You are my prayer." "I am the ground." "You are my sky." "We met, in spite of being worlds apart." That's my husband. He's my husband. "Nothing came between us." - He's my husband. "Let me spend my life with you, beloved." "Let me spend my life with you, beloved." Aakash. - "In your arms..." "In your path..." "In your arms..." "In your path..." "Let me spend my life." "With you..." "Let me spend my life with you, beloved." I tried hard to look for you. Phone calls, letters, emails. But I didn't get any reply. Then I thought of asking your father. All I got was abuses. I was in prison for six months. The loan we took was in my name. After you left, I couldn't repay the loan on my own. First I went under trial and then I was imprisoned. Our child? He's playing outside. He? Daddy. How did he recognize me? I've been telling your son about you since the last four years. And everyday, he looks at this picture and waits for you. What is your name? - Aakash. Go out and play, Aakash. The name Aakash holds some hope to it. I wish you were here. I wish we were together. I couldn't find a name better than Aakash to live with this hope. Nikita, I'm here to take you. Come back, man. Come back. The letter that you had kept for us in Delhi Darbar... ...got burnt with the restaurant. We are making an appeal. Call us for the last time and tell us, how do we disarm this bomb. This is an appeal. Thank you. That's it. How much time do we have? Sir, two hours. Okay. One second. Ask the rescue team, if we run another train... ...parallel to this one, at the same speed... ...can they transfer the passengers from one train to another? Come on. Come on. Move your hand. Give me your hand. You need to help her. Grab my hand. Come on. Come on. Steady. Steady. Be careful. Come on! I can't. - Don't look down. Keep moving. Please, go. Faster, faster. Give me your hand. You can do it. - Faster, faster. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Faster. Give me your hand. Mr. Manish. Someone's come to see you. Who is it? I'm Megha's friend. She has told me about you. And I came here to... You are here to pay the fees for the operation? Yes. I'm here to pay the fees. You are brother Aakash, right? No, I'm Arjun. Which Aakash are you talking about? Aakash Rana. My sister treated him like a brother. She had said that he and brother Aadil... ...will come to meet me before the operation. Surprising. Aadil never told me anything about Aakash. Four years ago, he was their boss. Then, all of a sudden, he had to shut down the company... ...and go to a foreign country. I heard that he came back a few days back. Yes, Megha was saying something about it. I don't remember the company's name. What was the name of the company? Global services. Global services. Okay. Sister said she'll be back before the operation. Hello, Vikas. Do a background check on Aakash Rana. We deported him to India 4-5 years ago. He used to work here in a company called Global Services. I want details of his family, his friends. I want details of his every move. Excuse me. Please charge for Manish Solanki. I think it's Ward E, bed four. Sorry, what name? - Manish Solanki. Oh, everything has already been paid for, sir. By whom? - Oh, he was just here. He left for the ward. Just down that corridor. Vikas, that scoundrel is here. He just paid the hospital bill. I am getting all doors and exits of the hospital closed. You quickly send backup. Please call security. This is Detective Arjun Khanna. Counter Terrorism Command. The train bomber has been spotted in your hospital. Yes. The train bomber has been spotted in your hospital. I want you to lock all your doors, exits, anything to get of here. Nobody moves out of the hospital till the police comes. Come with me, I want to see his face. - Sorry? I mean I want you to identify him. I want you to identify him. Please come with me. Okay. Please calm down. Please go home and wait. There he is. He's gone that way. Police. Come out. No. Open the boot. Sorry. CTC. - Sir. This is Anne. She has seen the suspect and she'll be able to identify him. I want every person, every car, every boot to be checked, now. Yes, sir. - Yes. Yes, Vikas? Sir, there are some Air India tickets booked... ...under Aakash Rana's name. The flight leaves at eight. Some Nikita Rana and a child are with him. Where are you? Where are you at the moment? I'm going to the headquarters, sir. Go to the airport, right away. And go directly to the check-in counter. And see to it that no one boards the flight using those tickets. Are you listening? I'm on my way. So, we went up to look at the security cameras. Then we came down here... Sir. So far no man named Aakash Rana... ...has showed up at the check-in counter. Now the counter has closed, sir. And there is no booking on this name on any other flight. Thoroughly crosscheck any Indian or Asian you come across. Sir. Did you get any photo or ID of Aakash? That will take a little time, sir. Immigration department will send us a photo as soon as they find it. If he isn't taking flight then... ...there is only one way to get out of this country. When does the train to Paris leave? Sir, I think, the last train leaves in an hour and a half. He has made a fool out of us. Come on, let's go. 'The letter that you had kept for us in Delhi Darbar... ' '... got burnt with the restaurant.' 'We are making an appeal.' 'Call us for the last time and tell us, how do we disarm this bomb.' 'This is an appeal. Thank you. That's it.' Sir, the ministry has sent orders. We'll have to stop the train at Glasgow station. Sir, according to them, they have got the station vacated. And they have also sent a 90-member rescue team. This is not possible. They have lost their mind. The train cannot enter the station at this speed. Anyway, if the speed goes below 60... ...the bomb will explode before it reaches the station. No, sir. They aren't reducing the speed. They want the train to crash against... ...the break-ribbons and sandbags at the speed of 60. Sir, the fire brigades is already there. They have also started spraying the anti-fire chemicals. Doctors, paramedics, police. Everyone is on standby. Even the passengers are being shifted to the last compartment. That will kill more than half the people. Sir, they say that at least some people will get saved. This is ridiculous. This is stupidity. Sir, it's him. Yes. Sanjay. There is no bomb on the train. You can stop the train. No, no. You are lying. Bomb squad has confirmed it. I saw the bombs under the train. Yes, there are. But they aren't activated. I had written the same in the letter I had send to the restaurant. Listen, please, don't play with the lives of innocent people. I cannot say anything more than that. Just a minute. Just a minute. The bomberjust called. He said that the bombs are fake and that they won't go off. He is a liar. We can't take that chance. We follow the ministry's orders and stop the train at Glasgow only. To hell with the orders. I am stopping the train right now. You cannot override the ministry. You understand! Oh yes, I can. I'm in-charge here. These are my people. And they will do exactly what I tell them to do. But sir, why do you trust him? Had he been a liar, he wouldn't have called. What? He wouldn't have called if it's a lie. If this goes wrong... ...you are going down for life. John, stop the train. Hello? I will wait for you at the station. I hope you come. Yes, I'm coming. Yes? Are you... Nikita Rana? Yes? Nikita, take a good look. The lives of 500 people now rests in your hands. Inform me as soon as you spot him. Excuse me. He's here. Okay, good. Move closer to him. Go to him. Authorities have confirmed that the bomb on... ...the Glasgow bound train 112 was a hoax. The high tension ordeal which lasted 14 hours today... ...has finally ended. There were no reports of causalities as passengers... ...started disembarking the express train minutes earlier. There was no bomb connected to the train. Everyone's safe. All the passengers of 112 have alighted from the train safely. Don't look towards me. Nikita? Nikita? Nikita, can you hear me? Nikita? Where is he? I'm asking you, where is he? Please tell me where is he. Sorry, that wasn't Aakash. What do you mean he wasn't Aakash? He wasn't Aakash but someone else. I know you saw him. I saw you looking at him. Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me. You are the one lying to me. You told me he's a bomber. Yes. Yes. He's a bomber. And this is your only chance to save the passengers. Once again you are lying. Everyone is safe. All the news channels are showing it. Someone was playing a prank. And you want to punish my husband for it? Just because if entered this country illegally? Just because he wants to meet his wife and child? Why are you not getting this? He is a criminal according to the law. And you are helping a criminal. Your law has given a very harsh punishment. He just wanted to help people. Do you have any idea how many lives and families... ...has your law ruined? Let him go. He wants to leave this place for good. I won't let that happen. I will arrest him. It's my duty. You... you... - I cannot help you in it. You can find him on your own. Please. Please. Please try to help me. No. Daddy. No. No. That's not him. That's not Aakash. That's not him. That's not him. No. The bomber is on level one. Send back up immediately. Can I go now? You have go... But to a prison. Surrender yourself. You don't have a choice. I still have a choice. Don't compel me. You are a criminal. You cannot escape your punishment. You don't need to be a criminal to endure a punishment. It's the same even if you are innocent. What wrong had I done? I tried to fulfill a dream of a good life... ...through hard work and honesty. It was called cheating. A fraud. I helped the ones in need. It was called sabotage. A murder. When I married the one I loved, it was called rape. Yet I got punished. Everyone was taken away from me. My wife, my child, my friends, my hopes, my future. Everything. You, too, must be having a wife, a child. Ask your heart... ...what would have you done had you been in my place? And still, if you think that I am wrong then take the gun. And shoot me. I am going, to my child. I want to hug him and sleep in peace for a night. No. 'We had a lot of dreams which stayed as dreams.' 'There was love, thank God, it stayed intact.' 'Lf you are reading this letter then it's certain... ' '... that I've gone very far away from you.' 'One man made a mistake and two had to suffer.' 'For all my mistakes and all the promises I didn't keep... ' 'Please forgive me.' 'And do me two favors.' 'Tell Aakash that his father was... ...a good man caught up in a bad situation.' 'Who died fighting for his love and his right.' 'And secondly, there is a cheque enclosed with this letter.' 'Send half the amount to Megha's brother and Aadil's mother.' 'And if we meet again in the next life... ' '... I promise, that story will have a beautiful ending.' 'Until then... ' 'I love you.' "The road was leading ahead." "There was danger behind."
