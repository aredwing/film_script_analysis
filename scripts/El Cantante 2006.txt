Enough! Who the fuck do you think you are, huh? You wanna be a man? You wanna be a fucking man, huh? Be a man. Huh? Shut up. Get out. - Ah, yes. - Get out. Get out. Why don't you get out? Get out. Get out! - Now! I said- - Listen to me. Shut the fuck up. - Listen to me. - Get out! - Oh, yeah. Huh? - Let go of me. Let go of me, Hector. Huh, Puchi? Huh? I'm gonna tell you something. You're finally going to listen to me, okay? Fuck you! How's that? Whore, fuck it. Doorman? Yes, is this the doorman? Don't give him his keys. No, he's drunk. Okay? Yeah, no. Thank you. I know it's tough, bro, but you have two problems. And I don't know which one's harder to quit. You? Me neither, man. But one'll kill you. And I love her. I can't help it, you know? I think she loves you too, man. We had a great show last night, gonna have another one tonight. It's all gonna be good. We got so much more to do, bro, and you're right there, front and center, bro. And I'm right behind you, you know? I got your back, bro. Hector, I just- I just want you to say that you're gonna try to make it work. I want you to say that you're gonna spend more time with Tito. I want you to say that you're gonna stop with all the drugs. And I want you to say that you love me, because I love you, baby, and I want us to be together. Is that too much? - Isn't that what you want? - You know what's funny is that... I'm not the only one fucking up here, Puchi. You know that. Puchi, you want it all, but I can't promise you all that- all that in one night. I can't. I'd be Iying to you, baby. And you can't either. You can't sit there with a straight face and tell me that you're ready to promise all that either. There's no way. I don't like talking about what hurts me. That's just the way I am, and you know that. And you don't like it either. That's us. Look... Look at me. What we had was like an old-fashioned type of love, you know? Not like this new- this new-wave soulmate type of shit, you know? It was good. It was bad. It was beautifuI. And for the first time in our lives we had everything that we'd never had. Yeah, I know what you're thinking, but love is never perfect when it's reaI love, all right? It's not his problem. It's not his problem. It's your problem. - Jerry, please. - And you're my problem. - Please, bro. - This is the last time he does this. Let's go, let's go! Hey, what's going on? Willie. Fuck, man, you're not gonna believe this shit. You're not gonna believe this shit, man. You're right, I won't. Hey, what's with you, man? Huh? No no no. Listen, let me explain it... - Brother, let me explain to you. - Hec- This is not another story, man, really. Hector, bro, this is the third time this month. I can't deaI with your crazy shit anymore, man. I quit. The band is yours. It's that simple. You can be late all you want to. Wait a minute, look, let's go someplace. Let's go someplace, man. Let's smoke a joint. Let's talk, just me and you, plea- - Brother, I-I was stuck in traffic, man. - Yeah? - Please believe me. - I told Ralphie to canceI all our gigs. I'm moving on. You do the same. I'll work with you, but not on the same stage. - Go home, Hector. - You're making a mistake, man. Eh, you know what? Fuck you. Just get some rest, man. ? The festivaI and the chapeI with their chanting? ? Highlight the emotion of the town? ? And the trembling lustfuI notice? ? Catalina la O...? This is the best thing that could have happened, okay? Now is your time, okay? He is nothing without you. Fuck him, all right? It's not that- it's not that you were always late. It's that he was always too early. It's a lot more than that, Puchi. It's a lot more than that. I mean, Will- W- Willie was like my brother. I know he was like your brother and he'll always be like your brother, okay? You are the show. Everybody knows that, Hector. Let him go out there and try and sing with that squeaky little voice of his and see how far he gets. Forget it. It's his loss. All right? This had to happen. This is the way it's supposed to be, okay? It's gonna be all right, baby. Now "the man who opens his mouth" is going to sing, Hector Lavoe, come on! By 1975, Hector had recorded 12 albums; he had seven number-one hits; he had drugs; he had a wife; he had a kid; he had a family; he had other women- everything you need for a good guy to break down. Go away, take a vacation. Hector? Baby, are you okay? It's okay. Imagine you wake up in the middle of the night and you see your husband just sitting there like he's a character from a horror movie. And all you can think is, "Shit, it's my fault. " He was hurting inside. He couldn't- he couldn't hold it in anymore, you know? So his body- his body just shut down. Men like Hector, they don't- they don't get therapy. They don't go to AA or anything like that, you know? But we- we- nobody ever knew about that stuff because we kept our private lives very private. Mom, are we going to the hospitaI today? Uh, no, sweetie, not today. - Next week. Next week. - You always say that. I know, but- but I promise. Come on, honey, be good. Just get dressed. I'll be there in two minutes. I love you. Going to a dance? You know, he's your brother, but he's my husband too. So give me a break, okay? I wish I could, but you know, from the first day you met him, and from the first day I met you, I had a bad feeling. His father never wanted him to come here so he'd never have to meet people like you. - I always wanted to tell you that. - Well, you said it. Are you happy now? You know what? Ciao, Priscilla. Mind your business. Go get fucked and all that. You know, you may not like my kind, but he doesn't seem to mind it much. Yeah? Look where he is. I hate the food in this place, man. How's Tito? Does he listen to you? Yeah. I miss you. I miss you. I do. Do I look crazy to you? Baby, let's go home. - Dad! - Hey, son. Oh, Ave Maria. You look good. I missed you, boy. Look at you. Look at this. Looks like my grandfather's night table. Well, take your medication. I don't want you going crazy on me tonight. No? Okay. Ralphie called. What did he want? What do you think? Had a bunch of stuff lined up- shows in Los Angeles, Europe, Caracas, you know. But I spoke to him. I handled it. They're not gonna be fucking with you like they did before. I told him that first you had to get back to spending time with your son... making love to your wife. You hear me? What is it, baby? You nervous? Yeah. I'm- I'm straight. That makes me nervous. I know. Hope you're listening. Yes. Mm-hmm. ? Aguanil? ? Aguanil? ? Aguanil aguanil may may? ? Aguanil aguanil may may? ? Aguanil may may? ? Aguanil aguanil may may? ? Aguanil aguanil may may? ? Ay aguanil aguanil? ? Aguanil? ? Give me water I'm thirsty and want to drink? ? Aguanil aguanil may may? ? Aguanil aguanil may may? ? Aguanil? ? Aguanil aguanil may may? ? Aguanil aguanil may may.? You ever seen a coqui sing? Seen one in the Bronx? No. That's right. You've never seen one because you can't see them. They're there. You can hear them, but you can't see them. And they only sing one song. And it's two notes- Just like that, all their life, their whole life. They're born to do that. And they live everywhere in Puerto Rico. And they can't survive anywhere else in the world. I guess you're a little bit like the coqui, huh, Hector? Fuck, man, you can be depressing. Yeah. Look at me. What, am I in love with a frog? Don't be, you know, fucking depressing. Don't be depressing? Instead of- - I have a dyslexic one. He goes... Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Corso. We have a surprise guest for you tonight- Mr. Rubn Blades. Hello. I'm Rubn Blades and tonight I'm here to give someone a present. I wrote this song for Hector Lavoe, someone I really admired since I was a kid who wanted to be a singer. I remember when I went over there to Panama with Willie Coln. - Damn. - After I sing it for you, it's his. It's called "El Cantante. " It goes like this. ? A la le? ? Le le? ? My best testaments? ? Today I dedicate to you? ? My best testaments? ? Today I dedicate to you? ? My best testaments? ? Today I dedicate to you? ? My best testaments.? Hey, look, I'm buying- What the fuck-?! Pay him off. Hector, baby, you here? Hector. Hi, honey. Ah, look who's here. My favorite little whore, just like I like it. What's gotten into you? You crazy? - Nah, where were you, babe? - In a sexy mood? - Where were you, baby? - I was- what? - And you're st- - I was at my sister's house. - And you're stoned too, yeah? - No. - Oh. - I left Tito over there. And you're stoned. You got stoned at your sis- - No. - How is she? - No, I got chicken. She's good. - Yeah? She's- - Zaida's good. - She's good? - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. And- - You look nice. - Thank you. Yeah, I b- I bought you chicken. - You hungry? - Dressed like that? - What? - Looking like that, you were at your sister's house? - Yeah. - Oh, yeah? - Yes. - You look like a whore. Like a whore? And since when don't you like it? You wanna- you wanna eat here or you wanna eat in the kitchen? I got you wings and thighs and everything. What do you want? I got potatoes. I'm good. Come on. You know, I was gonna surprise you at the club, but then I went by there and you weren't there. Where the fuck were you, huh?! Smile, smile. Okay, you got it, you got it. Give me some more. Give me some more. Oh, get out of here. All right, look this way. What? - No, huh-uh. - Good job, good job. Bye. Tell me he doesn't look crazy. I mean, I think he looks a little crazy, but it's gonna work. I don't know. Baby, do the sad face. Like this... - Hold on, hold on. Don't even take it. - Take five. This is exactly where we wanna be. It makes me crack up when you do that funny face. - Who was on the phone? - Huh? Who were you talking to on the phone? - Nobody. - Oh, nobody? - No. Nothing. - Huh? No? Fucking whore, damn it. Who was it, the fucking piano player? Huh? What, the bass player? Who the fuck was on the phone, Puchi? What are you talking about? What am I talking about? - Don't do this here, please. - Don't do this here? - Come on. Go over there. - What are you doing? Hold it in. Puchi, don't do that. Damn it. Walk. What, you really wanna know who I'm fucking? Okay. All of them. The bass player, the drummer, the congo player- all of them. All of them except the singer. Yeah. Because the singer is always too high to get it up. That's why. You know what? You accuse me of fucking so many men that I'm finally gonna fuck all the men that I'm accused of fucking. Okay? ? I have not seen you in so long...? Okay. I just wanted you to be proud of me, but from what I see, fuck it, eh? Go ahead, give it to him. - Here. - What is it? He made it for you in shop at schooI. - How nice. - You like it? That's perfect, son. I wanna take it everywhere with me. Thanks, man. Don't worry, my feelings are not hurt or anything. There goes- there goes mommy. - I love you too, Ma. - I love you, baby. Show him your dance. I know you're dying to do your dance. - Go ahead. - Do I have to? No. - Just don't laugh at me. - Okay, son. - Please don't laugh at me. - No, I won't say- Don't laugh at me. Look, why don't you let me help you? That's what a wife does. Just let me. I'm gonna take you on tour with me. I don't wanna see any more doctors, okay? It's not a doctor. It's nothing like that, I promise. Puchi, can I enjoy watching my son, please? It's better than any doctor, huh? I enjoy this. I won't break. I know you enjoy this, but how about him? - Oh, damn. - Since you only see him once every six months, and even when you're home- don't think I don't know you're fucking high, Hector. Puchi, God, don't start with that shit, man. What's with you, man? Huh? I'm trying to fucking relax. Or maybe I should go somewhere else to relax 'cause I can't relax - in this fucking house. I can't do a goddamn thing, man. - Yeah, that's a good idea, maybe another rehab. Or maybe you should go to one of those fucking whores who keep fucking calling the house. Enough, damn it, Puchi. It's enough! Damn it! ?... Baby, that's plenty? ? And never has one man rocked so many? ? I'ma make you wet then make you sweat? ? Just to see how funky you can get? ? Now when I'm on the mic, I do serve well? ? And I go by the name of the-? What the fuck, man? I'm sorry, son. Oh, man. Oh, this can be fixed. Look. Oh, we can fix this, son. With a little Crazy Glue we'll fix this. Look look look look. All the pieces are here. It's okay. Son, it's not okay, okay? I mean, I was a warrior, but that was one battle that I never won. Your son- he can't keep seeing his mother and father like this. Do it for him. Don't do it for me. Don't do it for you. Do it for him. He loves you. He needs a father. But he couldn't do it. Maybe deep down he didn't want to. I don't know. Maybe you didn't want him to change. Why the fuck wouldn't I want him to change? That was- that's so stupid. He was my husband. Of course I wanted- I wanted him to be better. I think you owe me an apology. God knows when you got it. It doesn't matter. But yeah, the H.I.V. test came back positive. Uh... I'm really sorry, man. And Puchi? Well, the doctor says that the- the disease might not show symptoms for years or even- maybe never. He doesn't know how long I've had it. He said that you should get yourself tested... just in case. I don't want anybody to know about this. What's in the future for Hector Lavoe? I'm looking forward to the best years of my life, you know. Think about it, look around- every year's supposed to be "the Latin boom," you know, and now young musicians come and make money. And then, you know... I'll go back home and be myself, just a nobody. I was thinking, man- I was thinking of getting an apartment in Jersey or something- a small little place, you know? I can't stay, man. I'm more afraid to go. There's somebody here tonight that's trying to hide from us, but it's not working. Hector, come on, man. Come up and sing. You're under arrest. You can't run. Come on, we really do need a good singer up here. All right, ladies and gentlemen, Hector Lavoe. ? Because your love is my backbone? ? In all four corners? ? They talk about us? ? They say this is a scandaI? ? And even put me down? ? For loving you? ? Pay no attention to the people? ? Stay the course? ? And love me even more? ? I've had enough of this? ? Let's move on? ? Without knowing what they'll say? ? If I could one day? ? I would climb up to the stars? ? I would take you with me? ? To where nobody could see us.? Excuse me. Don't touch me. Get off me. - Come on, let's go. Don't make me take you out. - What are you doing? - Hey. - Let's go. - Motherfucker, get off. - Come on, calm down. Look what they're doing to your wife, faggot. - Do something, you chunky little faggot. - Puchi, Puchi, what are you doing? - Get off! - Let's go. That's- okay, come here. Come here. - Hey, Puchi, Puchi, no. - Leave me alone, you piece of shit! - Come on. - You can't even be a husband. You can't even be a father. - Gentlemen. - You coward. Puchi, come on, let's go. - Huh? Hey. Fuck! - Leave me alone, please. Puchi. - He can't even be a father. - Puchi, enough, damn it! Puchi. You don't have a son! You hear me? You don't have a son. It was an accident. He was shot in the stomach with the gun... by his best friend. Well, anyway, I don't like to talk about that too much. You know, I'm- I just- I don't remember too much from that year anyway. It was- Don't talk to me like I'm your grandmother. I'm your mother and if I ask you where you're going, then you tell me where the fuck you're going. And if you don't know, then you make it up. But please don't say that you don't know. - All right, I got- - You better give me a kiss right now. - Mmm. - I love you, Ma. You feeI like you're gonna die too, but you live through it, and that's worse- you wish you'd die. Tito? Oh, Hector? He died with him. Your son is smiling at you one minute, the next thing you know, you turn around and he's gone. No one prepares you for that. All the death in the world couldn't prepare you for that, and I've been around a lot of death. But Hector- Hector... I'm gonna get going here. If you need anything, just- just call me up, okay? Thanks for everything, bro. I appreciate it. Puchi, I- be back in the morning just to check up on you. Hey, uh- I I- I love you guys. Hey, Puchi. See you. That's it. Everybody's gone. You know what I've been thinking? We don't talk anymore. You know we haven't been straight for more than three hours a day for, what, 20 years? Not since we met. And we just go on with life like this. I love you, you know, but... it's impossible, Puchi. Impossible? Impossible? Oh, I get it. Now that our son is dead, it all comes clear to you? I'm this horrible bitch and you're a great guy? And maybe the best thing to do is just to- to make it officiaI now? Is that what you're saying to me, Hector? All of a sudden a fucking light bulb went off in your head... and now you're realizing that you and me ain't good together? Is that what you're fucking saying to me right now, Hector? So we're just gonna break things up to fix it up? That's your fucking genius idea? Fix what up? Now? You f- fucking selfish bastard. You can never leave me. I've never been scared of death, man, I mean... And Puchi? She tested fine. Still going out, you know? I don't like talking about this shit, you know? It's like you can hear the clock ticking in your head or something. You know- dah dah dah. Fucking with you. Can't sleep. Imagine, I can't sleep. I have all the time in the world to think about, "I should have quit... I should have done this, I should have done that. " Can't do shit now. Yes, you can. Of course you can. Can't smile the same. Can't sing the same. Nothing's the same. It's like... the fucking woman I fell in love with, right... I put up with it. Now she can't put up with it, you know? It's almost like- you're doing time or something. I don't know. I don't understand it. You know what? I'm gonna break you out of jaiI. I'm here, and there are people still waiting for you to sing again, to see you. They feeI for you, man, they mourn with you, but they need you. These people- these people love you, Hector. They love you like, shh... No matter what. But they're not gonna wait forever. You know how it is. Listen, take that gig in Puerto Rico. It's home. Take it. Merengue and all this other stuff that's coming out now is gonna kill you, me, Fania and everything. Let the people know we're still here before they bury all of us. How does anybody ever leave this place, man? We're back now, man. Feels good, huh? Yeah. Maybe- maybe this is a new beginning, Papa. I hope so, man. I- I feeI good, man. I feeI good. Patience, people patience. In a couple minutes were going to start this great Salsa concert. But please... Now somebody explain something to me, bro. I just- I hear cancellation 'cause he canceled it. - No, listen, Hector- - Wait. Somebody talk to me, tell me the fucking truth, bro. I'm really sorry about this whole situation, bro. I don't wanna canceI, but Ralphie- Ralph, see? The place is empty. You know, people didn't show up, man. What the fuck do you want me to do? You know, I did my part. Whatever happened here, bro, wasn't my fault. That's all I know. - It's not your fault? - It's not my fault. You didn't fucking advertise, okay? And don't fucking talk to my artist. Hey, w-wait-w-w- Take it easy, okay? Yeah, it's like you didn't know about the free concert that's going on today, - right, in San Juan? - The free concert? You didn't know about that either? Five free bands. You knew about that concert, so this is what you get. This is your concert now. You take care of it now, all right? You're not in New York now, buddy. Bro, you're not in New York, okay? This is Puerto Rico, buddy. - Easy easy. - You gotta fix what you broke, brother, okay?. Come on, come on. Easy easy, okay? I'm gonna fucking sing now. Take it easy, okay? First of all, I'm fucking here, okay? I'm not a ghost. I came to sing, I came to sing, bro. Tell- Eddie, tell the band not to fucking leave, okay? - Hey, you guys don't go anywhere. - The band is here. I'm here. I'm the only one here. This one's on me. You guys fix all your fucking problems, but I'm gonna sing, bro. I'm a professionaI. Let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go, man. ? Soon? ? My lucky day will come? ? I hope that before I die? ? My luck will change? ? Soon? ? My lucky day will come? ? I hope that before I die? ? My luck will change? ? Soon? ? My lucky day will come? ? I hope that before I die? ? My luck will change? Yo! Hey, pull the sound back up! Pull the sound back. - Pull the fucking sound back up! - Hello? "Hector I LOVE YOU SO MUCH" Hey! Go on, go on, go on, damn it, go on! ? Soon? ? My lucky day will come? ?

I don't lose hope that I'll fight? ? And surely my luck with change, but when will that be?? Hurry up! Help him, please. I mean, how do you live through that, right? What did they expect from him? What, that he was fucking Superman? King Kong couldn't live through that. I mean, I- sometimes I wonder what I'm doing sitting here in one piece. Everybody in the story is fucking dead. He had multiple fractures and broken bones and he hurt all his insides which were already all fucked up from all the drugs and the alcohoI, and he survived. You know what? The motherfucker survived the fall. He hit an air conditioning shaft on the way down outside Johnny Pacheco's room and he bounced, that's all. But if he would have hit the concrete, he would have been dead, forget it. But he didn't. He did- he lived. He lived five more years. But it wasn't reaI life. And I wasn't there for him all the time, you know? Never never leave me, baby. It's not the same thing as being there with you. touching you, kissing you. You know, well. I'd better stop. Just wanted to tell you over and over that I love you. I'm right here with you. You see me. Happy birthday, Puchi. Happy bi- I wanted to remember him like he was. Like he wanted me to. ? El le le? ?
