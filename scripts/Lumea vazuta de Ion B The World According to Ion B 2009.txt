'Scuse me... 5 00:00:40,782 -- 00:00:42,932 Has anything ever hit you in the head? 6 00:00:45,142 -- 00:00:50,580 No, but it almost has. A woman got hit with a crust of bread, 7 00:00:50,742 -- 00:00:53,540 hard as concrete... Like that bottle over there. 8 00:00:53,902 -- 00:00:57,690 Good thing you've asked me, sonny!

Wake up! - Shit... 21 00:03:20,142 -- 00:03:23,578 These dustmen have never come so early... 22 00:03:24,262 -- 00:03:27,095 Open the dumpster, Ion. Give it here. 23 00:03:29,502 -- 00:03:31,254 Open the dumpster. 24 00:03:58,102 -- 00:04:01,139 During communism, you couldn't do anything, sonny. 25 00:04:01,302 -- 00:04:07,935 I think you weren't even born. Sorry... How old were you in '83? 26 00:04:08,582 -- 00:04:10,254 - 4. - Well... 27 00:04:13,302 -- 00:04:16,977 When you were my age, how did you imagine life? 28 00:04:18,582 -- 00:04:21,813 I didn't believe in anything, I thought I was immortal. 29 00:04:24,582 -- 00:04:29,576 I was handsome. I was a sort of... Have you heard of Rudolph Valentino? 30 00:04:35,822 -- 00:04:38,541 Do you know why I am in such a state? Because of my brothers, 31 00:04:38,662 -- 00:04:43,782 my parents and my mother. I have a brother in the country. 32 00:04:43,902 -- 00:04:48,453 If you see him, he hasn't read a book in all of his life. 33 00:04:48,742 -- 00:04:51,859 I've read a few things. I'll tell you about Chekov. 34 00:04:52,182 -- 00:04:55,413 When I read Chekov... I had found a booklet. 35 00:04:55,582 -- 00:04:59,575 You know, a great Russian writer... He wrote "Ward No.6". 36 00:04:59,742 -- 00:05:01,892 I was put in an institution once, it was a mistake. 37 00:05:02,022 -- 00:05:03,614 Some assholes put me in there. 38 00:05:03,742 -- 00:05:06,336 He was sleeping here, on the stairs. 39 00:05:06,502 -- 00:05:09,494 Our super got pity of him, and took him in here. 40 00:05:11,422 -- 00:05:16,098 Many of us were... They told him "why did you bring him here?" 41 00:05:16,942 -- 00:05:19,979 And others were... And he said something like 42 00:05:20,142 -- 00:05:26,138 "some keep dogs..., animals, I'll keep a human being, 43 00:05:26,382 -- 00:05:28,532 why is it bothering you?" 44 00:05:33,462 -- 00:05:36,135 I met him when I came here, almost 30 years ago. 45 00:05:36,262 -- 00:05:41,097 I found him here. He was alone, he had no family. 46 00:05:42,342 -- 00:05:46,938 In time, I found that he had come from somewhere in Moldova. 47 00:05:47,502 -- 00:05:50,062 He had run away from home. 48 00:05:59,862 -- 00:06:07,132 I'm from Vaslui, Zpodeni County. Z-po-deni. 49 00:06:08,782 -- 00:06:10,500 You recording me? 50 00:06:18,502 -- 00:06:23,576 My father was a Stalinist. I'm a self educated man. 51 00:06:24,702 -- 00:06:29,457 Now I'm just "bottle-educated". Sorry, sonny... 52 00:06:36,422 -- 00:06:40,540 Come here... Tigress, come here, girl. 53 00:06:47,862 -- 00:06:50,820 Mr. Alex, I hit her sometimes, but she's still coming back. 54 00:06:51,022 -- 00:06:57,291 I met him by sheer miracle. 55 00:06:58,502 -- 00:07:04,532 On the 1st of December, last year, in 2007, on Romania's National Day. 56 00:07:06,382 -- 00:07:11,934 Ovidiu Fenes, one of my artists, came to the gallery. 57 00:07:12,742 -- 00:07:19,739 He seemed possessed "come with me, I've got something to show you". 58 00:07:23,022 -- 00:07:28,221 There are about 900 collages, that cover some sort of... 59 00:07:30,142 -- 00:07:34,055 They cover everything from the 70s to the mid 90s. 60 00:07:34,742 -- 00:07:40,612 And everything is... It's a well rounded work of art. 61 00:07:42,022 -- 00:07:45,935 It's any gallery owner's Graal. 62 00:07:52,982 -- 00:07:55,416 Why did you make all these clippings for? 63 00:07:55,542 -- 00:07:57,419 For the collages. 64 00:08:01,182 -- 00:08:03,616 Do you know how much I enjoy cutting them? 65 00:08:03,982 -- 00:08:05,938 But I also like to turn them into collages. 66 00:08:06,102 -- 00:08:08,297 Cutting things is very hard work. 67 00:08:10,462 -- 00:08:13,260 During one single night, I can cut as many as in this heap here. 68 00:08:13,382 -- 00:08:15,942 Where from? Do you buy the magazines, or? 69 00:08:16,302 -- 00:08:19,738 I used to buy them, now people just throw them in the garbage. 70 00:08:25,582 -- 00:08:27,812 Belmondo, when he was young. 71 00:08:30,622 -- 00:08:33,739 This one is from "Il Gattopardo". Burt Lancaster. 72 00:08:38,142 -- 00:08:43,614 This one is a Rock singer, Prince. And this is Liz Taylor. 73 00:08:49,222 -- 00:08:54,535 I wanted to be an actor. I had the calling. 74 00:08:56,182 -- 00:08:59,174 Only a man that knows what the secret life is, 75 00:08:59,302 -- 00:09:02,817 can be in the movies. But now I'm a director. 76 00:09:03,302 -- 00:09:07,136 I've only later realized that the most important is the director. 77 00:09:10,302 -- 00:09:17,617 Get it? Elia Kazan was a Turk who went to America. 78 00:09:37,902 -- 00:09:39,733 That's it! Stop! 79 00:09:52,142 -- 00:09:56,897 I could've done the same thing, but not as beautifully as he has. 80 00:09:57,742 -- 00:10:02,611 But, you know, only few really acknowledge his talent. 81 00:10:03,582 -- 00:10:10,260 So, the right people don't know. Listen, I'm going... 82 00:10:12,942 -- 00:10:15,615 - Where should I put the money? - Here, in the... 83 00:10:15,742 -- 00:10:18,461 - You won't lose it, right? - Thanks and bless you. 84 00:10:27,422 -- 00:10:30,971 I don't understand what you want from him, really... 85 00:10:31,822 -- 00:10:34,859 - He's a very good artist. - Maybe. 86 00:10:35,102 -- 00:10:38,253 But he has no ID, no nothing. He's been here for 22 years. 87 00:10:38,542 -- 00:10:43,058 They took him in out of pity and it's been 5-6 years now. 88 00:10:43,222 -- 00:10:45,941 Nobody put him to work. The super wanted to set him up 89 00:10:46,102 -- 00:10:48,536 with an employment record, so that he could have 90 00:10:48,662 -- 00:10:50,857 a retirement fund. He refused it. 91 00:10:51,022 -- 00:10:54,810 You've asked me, I've answered. He's a great artist! 92 00:10:56,342 -- 00:10:58,981 What can one do with a drunkard who, most of the time, 93 00:10:59,142 -- 00:11:01,337 doesn't even know he's own name? 94 00:11:01,582 -- 00:11:04,050 You'll see, ma'am... Come to the gallery. 95 00:11:04,182 -- 00:11:08,141 May God make him stop drinking. Do as you think fit. 96 00:11:09,422 -- 00:11:12,459 Wow, you're all dressed up! A real dandy! 97 00:11:12,582 -- 00:11:14,777 I don't want the neighbors to see me. 98 00:11:15,502 -- 00:11:20,530 One of his problems was the place he was living in. 99 00:11:21,182 -- 00:11:27,576 I've found him a studio where he could live like normal people do. 100 00:11:29,422 -- 00:11:34,542 The yellow one. So this is it: Red, yellow and blue. 101 00:11:35,462 -- 00:11:39,296 Starting from here, okay? Red, yellow and blue, just like... 102 00:11:50,782 -- 00:11:52,340 Don't lose the keys! 103 00:12:05,342 -- 00:12:09,972 I'll be here for two more weeks. I'm really cleaning the place up. 104 00:12:10,142 -- 00:12:14,613 - Why two more weeks? - Well, 'cause... last night I... 105 00:12:15,382 -- 00:12:21,571 C'mon, pops! Turn around! Al Capone... 106 00:12:48,902 -- 00:12:51,541 I'm neither Andreea Marin, nor Rduleasca. 107 00:12:51,982 -- 00:12:55,611 I'm Ion Brldeanu, collage director. 108 00:12:56,902 -- 00:13:00,178 Ion, first of all, you have to tell me, 109 00:13:00,302 -- 00:13:03,977 roughly, at least... When did you make them? 1990... 110 00:13:04,142 -- 00:13:06,576 Oh... I can't remember, I'll estimate it. 111 00:13:06,702 -- 00:13:09,216 Yeah, estimate it. '90-'91. 112 00:13:09,342 -- 00:13:13,221 If I had know there was gonna be an exhibition, I'd have signed them. 113 00:13:13,382 -- 00:13:18,410 Before... Last century, I mean... I'd have never written my whole name. 114 00:13:18,582 -- 00:13:21,494 - I'd have put only '89, '80... - Yes, exactly like that. 115 00:13:41,382 -- 00:13:42,815 '82. 116 00:13:48,182 -- 00:13:50,412 - Do you like this cardboard? - Yes. 117 00:13:51,862 -- 00:13:55,411 - It needs... - No, don't write your name there! 118 00:13:55,702 -- 00:13:59,854 I don't, I just wanna cover it up a little bit. 119 00:14:01,582 -- 00:14:04,813 Now it's hard to write my name, it has to be on the line. 120 00:14:05,342 -- 00:14:08,618 If I had a rubber stamp, I wouldn't work myself so hard. 121 00:14:09,582 -- 00:14:11,220 It's better this way. 122 00:14:11,462 -- 00:14:14,340 Many people have asked me about this timber here. 123 00:14:14,542 -- 00:14:19,980 I just measure it. I failed math, but I'm pretty good with geometry. 124 00:14:21,182 -- 00:14:26,097 There are more dots over there, and less over here. 125 00:14:26,262 -- 00:14:28,571 But I start at the centre, so that it'd look 126 00:14:28,742 -- 00:14:32,530 like a real classroom. And these are in pen, glued together. 127 00:14:34,342 -- 00:14:37,618 Here we have a Nazi Chaplin. This is the real Brigitte Bardot. 128 00:14:37,822 -- 00:14:39,540 - Really? - Really. 129 00:14:41,262 -- 00:14:43,822 This is "Gogu's Revenge". 130 00:14:46,662 -- 00:14:48,812 This one wanted to shoot him with the Mauser. 131 00:14:48,982 -- 00:14:52,258 The Germans had this gun during the war. 132 00:14:53,622 -- 00:14:57,535 The guy in jeans wanted to shoot Gogu on the sauerkraut keg. 133 00:14:58,662 -- 00:15:02,211 But look at Gogu's precision. Hadn't he thrown the axe in time, 134 00:15:02,342 -- 00:15:05,414 he'd be dead, that's for sure! Bang! 135 00:15:08,662 -- 00:15:12,496 Lino Ventura, Steve McQueen, Mircea Albulescu, Mircea Diaconu. 136 00:15:14,422 -- 00:15:19,542 - This one is a French actor. - Unbelievable... 137 00:15:20,582 -- 00:15:23,255 At first, this was a drawing and then... 138 00:15:25,542 -- 00:15:27,692 This one is taken from a Turkish newspaper. 139 00:15:27,822 -- 00:15:33,897 He's a "squint-eyed", the quack! The way he's holding the cigarette! 140 00:16:07,262 -- 00:16:10,060 I've been in this neighborhood for more than 25 years. 141 00:16:10,222 -- 00:16:11,894 I still had my hair... 142 00:16:28,542 -- 00:16:31,932 If I'm going back to my village, I won't even know my own folks, 143 00:16:32,142 -- 00:16:34,133 it's like I've been born here. 144 00:16:35,582 -- 00:16:38,301 I've lived in that building for 22 years. 145 00:16:48,382 -- 00:16:52,091 - Why did you leave? - Well, they threw my out. 146 00:16:56,302 -- 00:16:58,770 - Why? - I was aggressive... 147 00:17:03,662 -- 00:17:06,540 I'll tell you about it, but some other time. Not now... 148 00:17:09,382 -- 00:17:14,217 I've framed about 16 of them. 149 00:17:53,982 -- 00:17:57,691 He's the king of the magazines. 150 00:17:58,542 -- 00:18:02,694 He's been gathering stuff, so he has enough to keep on working. 151 00:18:02,862 -- 00:18:06,059 As far as I understood, he hasn't made anything in 10 years. 152 00:18:07,262 -- 00:18:10,891 After all these years, I wanna make somethin' new. 153 00:18:13,782 -- 00:18:16,899 I don't wanna get rich, I only want the bare essentials. 154 00:18:18,302 -- 00:18:21,453 But I'd really like one of those basic bikes... 155 00:18:51,102 -- 00:18:53,491 What did you fear the most in your life? 156 00:18:57,382 -- 00:19:00,579 Ceausescu! Can't you see how much I love him? 157 00:19:04,782 -- 00:19:09,697 In '79-'80, I started hating the communists. 158 00:19:12,862 -- 00:19:17,219 They put me in jail 'cause a grave digger denounced me. 159 00:19:19,782 -- 00:19:22,535 I was digging graves without a permit. 160 00:19:22,702 -- 00:19:25,500 I can still dig a grave. You don't need a degree for that. 161 00:19:26,462 -- 00:19:30,580 Those in Bucharest treated me as if I was an international criminal. 162 00:19:35,982 -- 00:19:39,054 There was a captain Tamas. A moron, with capital "M". 163 00:19:39,942 -- 00:19:42,172 He was in charge of the collectivization 164 00:19:42,302 -- 00:19:44,611 in Zpodeni County, just like my father, before him. 165 00:19:44,782 -- 00:19:49,094 They were mates. And he said: "You, rascal, 166 00:19:50,742 -- 00:19:53,381 you've ashamed your father! 167 00:19:57,382 -- 00:19:59,622 You'll spent 3 months in jail!" 168 00:19:59,622 -- 00:20:03,297 Everything was very strict. The smart ones had left the country. 169 00:20:04,302 -- 00:20:07,851 For years, I've earned my living with the shovel, like a nitwit. 170 00:20:08,102 -- 00:20:11,538 And it wasn't only me... There were engineers, too, 171 00:20:11,902 -- 00:20:16,817 doing all the hard work. How am I not to like Ceausescu? 172 00:20:47,742 -- 00:20:51,582 These are my movies. You really think 173 00:20:51,582 -- 00:20:55,780 they'll love me for them?

This winter was really harsh on him. 240 00:29:32,262 -- 00:29:34,856 He thought he won't live to see the spring. 241 00:29:35,182 -- 00:29:39,460 And then, when I came back to work, he told me that Mr. Dan had come 242 00:29:39,622 -- 00:29:43,410 and left him cigarettes, 10 packs of Kent and a million lei. 243 00:29:44,022 -- 00:29:47,537 "That's it!

Then things changed 267 00:31:43,382 -- 00:31:48,820 and he entered a rather Baroque area of the collage, 268 00:31:49,822 -- 00:31:52,939 in which he'd cut out the eyes and put them to other people. 269 00:31:53,142 -- 00:31:58,216 It was a sort of Surrealistic Pop, really strange and twisted, 270 00:31:58,422 -- 00:32:04,099 induced by alcohol, I'm sure, but, nevertheless, remarkable. 271 00:32:05,262 -- 00:32:08,777 Then things became more and more synthetic, 272 00:32:08,902 -- 00:32:11,416 simpler and minimalistic. 273 00:32:23,942 -- 00:32:29,141 His first works, the really crowded ones, 274 00:32:29,302 -- 00:32:32,533 are the ones I like the most. But he says "no'; 275 00:32:33,582 -- 00:32:39,452 he says that he wasn't at the top of his game yet. 276 00:32:54,182 -- 00:32:57,219 - Repeat after me: "ham", "clam". - "Ham", "Clam". 277 00:32:57,382 -- 00:32:59,737 - "Mississippi". - "Mississippi". 278 00:33:01,582 -- 00:33:03,493 - "Massachusetts". - Sorry? 279 00:33:06,142 -- 00:33:10,818 Let me take this...

Actually, Brldeanu is trying 285 00:33:37,982 -- 00:33:42,578 to say some disturbing truths and put them into images. 286 00:33:44,142 -- 00:33:47,418 His drawings are extremely ironic, and if those about Ceausescu 287 00:33:47,582 -- 00:33:50,582 had been seen in the underground circles, 288 00:33:50,582 -- 00:33:53,699 it would have stirred things up in the society of that time 289 00:33:53,862 -- 00:33:57,411 and the Securitate would have had to hunt 290 00:33:57,542 -- 00:34:00,261 an even more dangerous dissident." 291 00:34:04,582 -- 00:34:07,415 - What's up? - I keep away from the sun. 292 00:34:10,902 -- 00:34:16,659 You know what we should do today?

People put bottles in and it clogs up. 304 00:35:45,582 -- 00:35:48,654 Look. The cleaning lady washed the floor the other day, 305 00:35:48,822 -- 00:35:53,498 and when I went to buy water, I fell down and broke my hand. 306 00:35:53,622 -- 00:35:59,094 Can you imagine? Go fill this with water, for me... 307 00:35:59,742 -- 00:36:04,213 Please...

They've made up their minds. 313 00:36:27,862 -- 00:36:30,854 I've interceded with Mrs. Nina, 'cause she's the one... 314 00:36:30,982 -- 00:36:34,338 "Ma'am, please, tell the super to let him stay at least for a week." 315 00:36:35,382 -- 00:36:37,498 He talked back to the president, and that one is now bent 316 00:36:37,622 -- 00:36:42,252 on getting rid of him. They're all in it, together. 317 00:36:42,542 -- 00:36:47,536 They're saying "they are leaving, we're staying, we're neighbors." 318 00:36:49,902 -- 00:36:56,057 And we...
