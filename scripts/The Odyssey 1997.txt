Which? One! Hey! Swallow this. Not ... It's moly ... It has poison. It is I who give it to you ... A god to a mortal. No, I refuse. Good! But it is the only way to counter the fate of the witch. You do not trust me? She knows that you get. But now when you drink the potion with honey, you shall preserve human form. This will disconcert the witch. Frightens her a little! It will make you an offer then ... Take her to bed. It does not say she is a goddess! Only after that it will make you your men. Come on! You're almost there. You must be hungry and thirsty. Again.

No. You have given so much, Circe ... but no bed in the world will make me forget Penelope. Not in my lifetime ... let alone in five days. Poor Ulysses ... who believe they have been here for five days, while it has been five years. How do you play? What you think one day or one hour ... is a year out of these walls.
