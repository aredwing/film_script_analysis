I'm gonna eat hot dogs. Someday, I'm gonna go to America and enter a hot dog speed-eating contest! I'm gonna win it and be in the Guinness Book ofWorld Records! You know, Sakura... There really is something wrong with you. I've gotta work hard! Akuma used the Dark Hadou... ...and stained his hands with the blood of the old master, Goutetsu. And probably my master, Gouken's, too. Um... Can I help you? I... I'm here to see my big brother! I've heard the rumors, but InterPol sure let somebody incredible join up. Flank 'em, Chun-Li! What was that? Awesome! Is this some kind ofmovie shoot? I don't see any cameras or anything, though... Damn! Back off!. I'll blow this kid's head off!. Oh, no! What's going on here? Just try to mess with me! Keep an eye on this kid. S-Sure. He's slipping between the bullets like it was nothing! Who is this guy? Behind you! I wonder who that guy was? As good as he is, somebody ought to know his name. Ryu, a Japanese martial artist who defeated Sagat, the Muay Thai Emperor... He beat Sagat? Chun-Li! What is it, Wallace? What'cha doin'? No! It's not what you think! Forget about him, Chun-Li. It looks like those guys we caught work for Shadowlaw. Shadowlaw? They say Shadowlaw's funneling money to Professor Sadler, a well-known biologist. What's more, it looks like Sadler's gathering together martial artists... ...from around the world in one of his labs. Shadowlaw's backing Sadler...? Maybemy father's there, too...! What is this? Who's there? An illusion? There?! You certainly get worked up easily. You're still a child. I've come to tell you your future. What? You will soon meet someone who will shape your destiny. And through that meeting, you will change. Will you grasp the light, or be swallowed by darkness? Who are you? My name is Rose. That card is said to call up the Devil. But people can overcome suffering and grasp their heart's desire. If they can overcome all. Ryu, become even more powerful. You-- Rose... Hey. Ken? Hey, Ryu, you look a little out ofit! I guess. An interloper interrupted me. Will he become the trump card, or...? Ken, did you come all this way just to pay your respects? Yeah, but I have some other business, too. It's been a while, huh? Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. Right, the Master was like a father to you, wasn't he? You've been training here for as long as you can remember, right? Yeah. I grew up not even knowing what my parents looked like. Everything I know about life, I learned from the Master. And from the martial arts. I'll go get some water, okay? Sure. Thanks. Not again...! It's like all of the blood in my body is boiling black! Ryu! Open your eyes to the evil Hadou within you! I... What's happening to... Man, I really hate to give flowers to anybody but a cute girl... Ryu? Ryu! Snap out ofit! Ryu! What's wrong?! His little brother?! My name is Shun. I've been dying to meet you, Brother! '' Brother''? Are you serious? This is our mother. Hey, not bad! And this here is-- Looks like your average kid. I lived with Mom in Brazil. She always used to tell me, ''Your big brother lives in Japan.'' '' His name is Ryu.'' Still, that doesn't really prove-- She said she had a reason that she had to leave him... ...with a martial artist named Gouken right after he was born. That story was all she left me, and I finally found you. All she left you? She died six months ago. She always wanted to meetyou. So I came in her place. Refill! So why is it that you've gotta eat with us, too? 'Cause I'm his little brother! How come you gotta sleep in here with us, too? 'Cause I'm his brother... You can't expect people to believe you when you show up outta nowhere... ...and say you're somebody's little brother, you know! That's not true! Right, Brother? I wish you'd stop calling me that. Same here! You've studied the martial arts? Yeah! Ever since I found out my brother was raised by a martial artist! Your brother, huh...? Oh, forget it. He can call you whatever he wants. And Dad, he-- Hey, that's right. Come to think ofit, what about Daddy? You know, a Mommy can't have a baby all alone! She and Daddy have to-- Is our father dead, too? N-No. Dad's-- Out with it! Just drop it, Ken. Why? This is important, right? It doesn't matter. Big brother, little brother, mother, father... It doesn't matter to me. Brother! Spar with me once, okay? Excuse me! It'snothim. I'm sorry! Sakura, why'd you sprint in here all of a sudden? I'm looking for him! I'm gonna find that guy from yesterday! He had on one of these! Take that! I want to see him again. Excuse me! You there! Excuse me! I can't keep up. Sorry for the wait! Hey, there he is! What is this? Pork and beans. It was Mom's specialty. A taste of Mom's cooking, huh? Hey, not bad! Great, huh? So, why are we eating on the roof? Oh, pipe down. I like high places, that's all. It's sinking into the sea... Back in Brazil, we always watched it set in the sugar cane fields. Mom always used to face the setting sun and pray. '' Please let tomorrow be another good day,'' she'd say. For me and for her. And for my big brother, who was so far away. What's that chi coming from? Ryu! That chi is incredible...! It must be the Dark Hadou the Master told us about. Snap out ofit, Ryu! Ryu, you... Brother! - Brother...? - Don't... Don't touch me! Our style was originally used for killing. ''I wish to become the strongest of all.'' You must never let such a desire rule you... ...or the Dark Hadou into your fists. One possessed of an evil spirit will fight out of pride until his dying day, and most likely fight to kill. Just like Akuma, who took up the Dark Hadou... ...and whose hands are dark with the blood of his own master, Goutetsu! When did it start? Why did the Dark Hadou start to awaken? I don't know. Ryu... Kill me. IfI'm possessed by the Dark Hadou and can't break free, I want YOU to do it. Sadler's coming to Japan?! Seems a street fighting competition's being held down in Kabuki Town. The winner's gonna get some serious prize money. Sadlerwill be there? Probably. A street fighting tournament? I came all the way here to Japan to fight in it. Can I enter it, too? What's with the headband, kid? 'Cause I'm his little brother! Wants to dress up just like big brother, huh? Brother! You're gonna enter, too, right? Right? I... You two are my cheerleaders. Just you watch! I'm gonna show you some cool moves! You're not gonna fight, Brother? Not this time. You're no fun... Like I said, I am gonna show you some cool moves. That headband is really you! Try tying it again. Okay. Like this. Whenever I tie this on, I always ask my body a question. Am I worthy of this fight? Hurry! Hurry! What?! Kabuki Town? Darn it,just when I thought I'd finally tracked him down... Hejust left. Youjust missed him. I'm not gonna give up! I'm not gonna stop until I see him again! What a cheerful girl! Such spunk! - I... I give up. - Kei, I'm gonna leave you behind! Justyou watch! All right! I know the tournament's being held somewhere around here... Come on, man! Pipe down! I think there was something about the tournament on the internet. Huh? ''Out of area''? Is it the buildings? I'll find somewhere else and try again! Go on ahead! Hey, Brother... You're really not gonna fight in the tournament? No. But why? I heard you even beat Sagat! You'd be a cinch to win! I can't right now. Geez! But ifyou're strong, you oughta fight...! We'll fight you. Enough to make you cry. Or will you pay my doctor bill? These are Valentino sunglasses, kid! My buddy's shades are real expensive. Is this your wimpy brother? You little punk! I didn't think I'd be able to do any street fighting in Japan. Shun! W-Why? Didn'tyoujust say it? Did you sayyou should fight ifyou're strong? I'm not strong. That's why I fight. I fight myself. I fight against myself. Can you stand? Excuse me! I hear there's a street fighter tournament being held around here. My, what a brave little girl... You don't wanna see that, honey! Come playwith us! Take this! Ow! That's funny... That kick shoulda connected in mid-air! Come on backwith us, okay? We'll have ourselves a good time. Cut it out! Hey, not bad! '' Not bad''? Are you a street fighter, too? If you are, do you know a guy with a headband like this? You mean Ryu? I'm Chun-Li, a special agent with the Asian branch of InterPol. I'm-- I know. You're Ryu, the man who took down Sagat. You're competing in this, too? No. You're just a spectator? Are you just here as a spectator today, too? I'm here on business, ofcourse. I'm on someone's trail. You liar! He's not here! He was, until just a while ago. Maybe he's inside. Must be. What a horrible fight... Winner! Vega! It's started! It's started! Fighter registration has already closed. What?! But I came all the way to Japan for this...! Why don't you just give up? There he is! Oh, come on...! That's... the Dark Hadou! The Dark Hadou...! Ryu? What is it? Don't tell me it's drawing you in, too! Ryu...! That's enough. Stop it. Brother... Brother... No, Ryu! Don't! Such power... It must be that ability... I want it. He deliberately missed... Over here! Areyou okay? I'm fine! I'm fine! Ow... Ow! Looks like it's broken. Come on, I'll carry you. Thanks. Brother... That was the Dark Hadou. Where did you learn it? From Dad. He used that hadou, too. He used the Dark Hadou...? Who the hell is that? It's too dangerous to hang around here. We'd better take off for now. But what about him? He'll be fine. I'm sorry. IfI hadn't gotten hurt, you could... Don't be stupid. Ladies always come first in my book. Kikou-ken! Brother! Ryu! Bro...ther, I... Shun... Shun... I'll give you a taste of that, too. There's that strange chi flow again... Incredible... I've never felt such enormous chi before. You lose. He's still alive! The Dark Hadou... I... I... Am I going down the same path as Akuma? Damn! Ryu! Ryu, pull yourself together! Shun, he's... He's still alive! Shun... SHUN! Hey, buddy, that hurt! You hit somebody, and you're just gonna walk away? Don't play dumb, you punk! - Come back here! - Bastard! Get over here! Stupid punk! Let's get outta here. The Dark Hadou? '' Dark,'' huh? So, that's the chi that generated such incredible power? That's what Sadler's after, then. The boy who was kidnapped isn't on par with you, but he's another user of the Dark Hadou, isn't he? Chun-Li... If that's the case, where was he taken? Sadler's laboratory. Knock knock. Hey. How's the patient? Not too bad, I guess. Now look here... Hey, I'm bored! How's he doing? How should I know? He hasn't had anything to eat or drink for days. The guy's practically a zombie. A zombie? A total zombie. Fall for him ifyou want, but don't get into the martial arts unless you're willing to go all the way. The pain he's going through right now is a wall all fighters slam into. Fighting. Becoming strong. If that's all you think about... ...you'll be end up plunged into eternal darkness. Will I turn into Akuma...? I can see it. I can see that your heart has lost its way. Rose... But you'll go on fighting. What do you know? The boy is wavering, just as you are. But the boy doesn't know how to stop it. The boy is merely waiting to be crushed by the darkness. Who can lift the darkness from him? Is it wrong for you to fight to do that? Ryu, the Dark Hadou is yours alone. The darkness or the light? It's up to you to decide. Which will it be? I see. The boy's soul is no concern ofyours, is it? Leave me alone! Ryu! What happened?! It's hopeless. IfI go on fighting like this, I'll be consumed by the Dark Hadou. Ryu... So before I rescue Shun, there's a man I have to go see. Huh? Where is he? That's what I'd like to know! Chun-Li's disappeared, too, damn it. Those guys sure don't mess around, do they? Huh? Hello? He wouldn't... Fighting. Becoming strong. But what is fighting? Why does he fight? Somebody actually lives here? Why doe she want tobecome strong? What is all this? He's here. I can sense his presence. What incredible power... What is this? I feel the Dark Hadou. Where is he? Has another come to my island in search of death? Akuma. Over there? A pupil ofGouken? Areyou traveling down the same path as me? No! Incredible... He's moving around with his chi completely masked...! The true warrior enters the arena with all his powers at the ready. I'm being pulled in... The enormous chi that Akuma's giving off is drawing me in... Ifyou are to fight me, awaken the power within you! Ryu! I... I'm not... like you! Then leave me. Ryu! Akuma! Do you have a family?! Do you have a son?! Where I walk, I walk alone. Where I fight, I fight alone. Where? Where will I find one who can stand against me? That's Akuma... The man who mastered our fighting style. If you go on fighting, you'll turn into that. Into someone who lives only to fight. I don't know. But I still have no choice but to fight. Ryu! Fighting and becoming strong are the only things that have kept me going. That much is certain. I figured you'd come here. Can you really beat it? I mean, even Akuma was swallowed up by the Dark Hadou. Hey! Stop it, you two! Ryu! Why? Why? Why does he fight? Why? Why is he trying to become strong? You can handle it, right? Ifanybody can, it's you... But if the time comes when I can't break free ofthe Dark Hadou... If that happens, you'll have to-- Ryu... Please. If I can only get my hands on the Dark Hadou, the world will be mine! Hey, this fight is only open to super first-class fighters, right? Other'n you, that is. Say what? Fine! I'll show you some first-class moves! Hey, you shouldn't go crazy in a cramped plane like this, okay? Besides, this bucket's about to fall apart as it is. We're ticked off'cause you little punks are here! Suit yourselves. I hope we can get that boy out of there safely. Yeah. So, how come you're going to Sadler's place... ...ifyou know how dangerous it is? I know it's your job, but still. My father might be there. He's disappeared. I hope you find him. Happy day! What the hell? Bravo! Loser. What the hell? This is a lab? What's his problem? I've got a bad feeling about this... Welcome, you martial artists who live only to fight! Today, I will make you show me exactly what you've got. Okay, that money's mine! Who's gonna take me on?! A worthy opponent! Not from where I'm standing. Gadou-ken! Are you gonna feed me or something? You'd better find me someone to fight soon! Don't let him chicken out and run away! Kinda fishy, isn't it? Looks like there's something underground. Wanna try to sneak in? Leave everything to me. Hey, where are you taking me? What the--? Muscular data... Brainwave data... Cellular data... I collect the data, one by one. And then the final data... When I incorporate the data from your Dark Hadou, the world will be at my feet! Geez, you're one harsh lady...! Okay, what're they doing to those street fighters they took away?! Ifyou don't talk, I'm gonna feed you to the scary lady over there. He's... taking their data! P-Professor Sadler's using them as research samples! Those... husks we saw walking around... ...are street fighters that had their data sampled? That's horrible-- What's wrong, Ryu? I can sense Shun's chi... He's in pain. You go find Shun! We'll rescue the other fighters! You've got to get out ofhere! They're going to sample your data and suck you dry! Where's Birdy? He was the first winner, so they already took him away. Chun-Li, we have to hurry! What in the world? What are they doing to him? Stay away... You've got to get out ofhere...! Birdie! Shun! I just can't do it... I'm sorry, Professor! Please forgive me! What did he do toyou...? I can sense it! Your brain is in turmoil! And now, the Dark Hadou will grow within you little by little! Hang in there... Somebody's here! Ken, this chi... It's Ryu's! It's not him. This chi is evil! Chun-Li! Get Birdie out ofhere! But, Ken...! Just do it! Wait, this chi is-- That chi! It's-- The chi... It's turning me...! You damn monster...! Birdie! For...get about me... You're still alive? IfI got taken out by a puppet likeyou, I'd never be able to live it down! Chun-Li... Ken... He's too dangerous... He isn't fighting for the same thing we are! You're wrong. He'sjust a puppet. Ken, don't do it...! Get out ofhere! Run, Ken! You can't move if somebody isn't pulling your strings, jack! I'm through here. I'm tired of playing. All that's left now is to wait for you. I'm still rarin' to go, you overgrown Pinocchio! Oh, you mean I can have some more fun with you? Ryu, you-- That's the way, Brother... Shun! Feel more anger! Feel more hate! Shun? That's right. It's me. You're-- You sure are an idiot, Brother. You're a complete fool, falling for such a simple trap. Why did you come? I'm not your brother. Even you didn't believe I was. Come on, fire off a Dark Hadou at me. This guy will die, Brother. Shun! Stop it! Fight. Shun! Stop! That's good, Brother. You're finally angry, aren't you? I've been looking forward to fighting with you. Fight! Fight harder! I want to collect more data from you! Fire more of them! Your abilities will become my own! I didn't even feel that. This body incorporates all the data taken from all those martial artists! You want to kill me? Then fire off a Dark Hadou. You're fighting because you hate me, right? Shoot, Brother! Come on, Brother... Shoot. Ken! I've never fought anybody just so I could hurt them. But not this time! I'm gonna kill you! You're a fool. Ryu, watch this... Ken! SHORYUKEN! Is that the best you've got? Shoot! Don't...! Shoot, Brother. Shoot. You'll feel better. Thank you. Now I have power equal to yours... No, even greater than yours! This body is magnificent! The evil is swelling up and flowing out of me! Only one person should have a body like this, and that's me! Ryu, I'm going to swallow you with my evil. Am... Am I going to be swallowed up by the Dark Hadou...? Or can your evil consume me, Ryu? Ryu. You haven't turned over the Card of Death yet. Brother, don't... Don't shoot... Ryu, don't lose... Hang in there. You're not like Akuma. You and I, we don't fight to kill! Why does he fight? Why? You keep fighting... ...to find that answer. How...? Bro...ther... So that's... how you fight, huh? Shun, I... I... Brother, why'd you come...? Pork and beans. It was Mom's specialty. A taste of Mom's cooking, huh? - Hey, not bad! - Great, huh? So, why are we eating on the roof? Oh, pipe down. I like high places, that's all. It's sinking into the sea... Back in Brazil, we always watched it set in the sugar cane fields. You knew it was a trap, so why? You didn't even think I was really your brother, so why...? You are my brother. 'Cause I'm his brother! Let's go. I'll never use the Dark Hadou again. Neither will you. I was after money. I wanted to help out my mom... And I wanted to become stronger than anybody else... So why did I... Next time, we... Aw, come on... Go easy on 'em, will ya? Sakura... I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna work hard so I can fight him when I see him again! Are you in a hurry to die, as well? But I'm not going down the same path as you.
