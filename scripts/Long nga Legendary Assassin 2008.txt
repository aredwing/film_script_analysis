Don't lose too much weight, or the wind will blow you away. Right. As if! -Thanks a lot. See ya -Bye. Haven't seen you in a year. Yet you still have an apetite. Well I'm full now. It was very satisfying It makes you feel alive. Do you think God will forgive us... For what we did in the past? Well, it depends which way you look at it. What suddenly made you think like this? You know travelling alone these few years, boredom I guess! It gets me thinking sometimes... Your fried eggs and tomatoes still taste like crap No it doesn't. If it tasted so bad, why did you finish it? You didn't add any soy sauce. Who fries eggs with soy sauce? Who doesn't fry eggs with soy sauce? Let me fry some up for you! I won't eat it. Eat it. It's very good. Wife Excuse me. Excuse me please. Attention residents. Please remain calm. In the light of the typhoon signal number 8 being announced All ferry services have been stopped But officer, I have to go to a banquet. So are the boats still running or not? Officer, isn't that a boat coming? That's the last ferry coming in. Once it docks, it stays. Come on! Officer Harrison, when will the ferry services resume? Mrs Fong, I'm a policeman, not a weather man I can't answer that question Watch the news, everybody. How can we watch the news now? I have nowhere to spend the night, what am I going to do? Don't wait here, if you can go home, go home. If you are looking for a place to stay, go look. Alright now, stop hanging around here. I'm in a hurry There is nothing I can do. Go. Go. There is still no answer on Chairman Ma's phone Keep trying! Did you listen carefully? Well, fugitives are always on the run. Last I heart he was nearby Mr, is there anything to eat around here? There is a typhoon, sorry we're closing. Thanks. Baby, come here! Come on, over here! Come, baby. Come here. Come here, baby, come... Baby, come, come to mom. Baby, come, yeah! Yeah... Come here. Oh my god. I am so sorry. I'll pay you back Do you have s needle and thread? Yeah Are you here on holiday? Aren't you bored, travelling alone and all? I am use to it. Being alone is convenient. Well, were stuck with a typhoon today. Pretty bad timing for a holiday. Since I am here, I may as well enjoy myself. I don't mind. You know, you can speak to me in Cantonese. Ok. Wow, your bag is heavy! Did you buy a lot of souvenirs? It's a bowling ball. You brought a bowling ball on your vacation? I am a bowling instructor. Are restaurants here open during a typhoon? There's one restaurant downstairs that stays open despite the typhoon Just take a left downstairs, walk down 3 blocks. Turn right, take the shortcut through the bushes and you're there. How about this, I will take you there. But lunch is on you. Damn it! It's a typhoon 8 and I'm still stuck here working. Ling Ming, since you are sitting so close why don't you crack up the radio? Turn it up! You idiot. So nobody's eating! Big deal. I am still making my noodles Winds are expected to pick up in speed within the next few hours. I got nothing to do anyway. Tell me, what else can I do? Good morning, Uncle G. Good morning. Hiu Wor. Morning. Little Ming New boyfriend? No. Mr. Bo is here on vacation Mr. Bo? Mr. Bo... Spending some time for vacation, I see. Let me introduce our specials for today. The abalone here is famous for... No thanks. Just the usual please. What's the usual? That would be fish ball noodles. Make it fast! Have you found a place to stay yet? With the typhoon going on, there won't be a ferry leaving for a long time. I tell you what, I have a place to rent that you can take up for the night. Just four hundred and fifty dollars Think about it. Fifty dollars for a bowl of noodles? Are you trying to rob us? The Hong Kong Observatory advises us to stay indoors during the typhoon. I am risking my life here! If I get blown away, who's going to look after my restaurant? Fine! Same price for you. And I will waive the 10% service charge. Damn it! Now I'm losing money. You don't look like a bowling instructor whichever way I look at you. Well, you don't look like a police officer either. What are you on about? All female cops in western films look just like her! It was Hiu's childhood dream to become a police officer. How rightgeous. Well, I wouldn't say it was my childhood dream. Certain things just require people who care to do the job. Exactly! Hiu and I are just those types of people. Whatever your complains are, whether it involves hygiene, transportation or housing. Even as small as the discoloration of toilet paper in public bathrooms. The lack of garbage cans or the lack of tourist information posts. Just say a word and I will have it reported immediately. I pay special attention to those who are weak and less fortunate. People like you can't protect yourself and lack self-righteousness. And that's where Hiu and I come in. Come on, we're not the only ones that can help. Defending justice and upholding society is everyone's responsibility. Here, let's eat. You need anything else? Chopsticks. Oh, yes. A speedboat in High Island was overturned by a massive tidal wave. Everyone on board is missing. The marine police have uncovered a large quantity of US Dollars on the abandoned vessel. Preliminary investigations reveal a possible connection with a robbery of a money exchange bureau in Tsim Sha Tsui last week. Police are investigating three male suspects of Chinese nationality. Eat your noodles. This is the police, please take out your ID cards. You want to check my ID while I am eating noodles? Why do you want to check my ID? Excuse me sir, can I please see some identification? Excuse me sir, can I please see... My shoe! What the hell? Are you alright? Can you please do me one more favor? Can you come with me to the police station to file a statement? Little Ming? Where's my... my restaurant? I know it's gone. Why didn't you mediate? I knew you wouldn't Ok. Let's go for a foot massage. How about you massage it for me? Don't be shy, come on! I don't bite. It's right here. Wrong. This "mouth" character is too big. The character for "mouth" can't be bigger... ...than the character for "eat" Otherwise you wouldn't be able to fit the food into your mouth. Why would you have such a big mouth to eat? A little mouth is good for eating. Just write it smaller. Smaller. Little Kin, have you finished with your homework yet? Your mother is back. Lets go home for dinner. Ok, ok. Coming. -All done! -Mommy! Finish the rest of it when you get home. Did you ask Tarzan for help with your homework? -Yes, it's all done. -Good boy. Here. Vegetables. How much? Just take it. I will tell you tomorrow. -Thank you! -Bye! Mom. Tarzan bullied me. What are you talking about? Who bullied who? Hello? Commissioner Yu. No problem. Just sign your name and you can go Mr. Bo -Thank you. Thank you. Attention. Headquarters is now verifying our suspects. There is a 90% chance we caught the guys involved in the Tsim Sha Tsui robbery last week. Good work. You smart girl. I've been on the police force for 10 years and I've never cracked a big case. You've been at it for 2 years and already you've solved a major case. No, it was all Mr. Bo. I couldn't have done it without him. Just call me Bo. One against three. You've been eating "night congee". Is that a midnight snack? It's strange that you've been travelling... Well... Let me introduce myself. I am Guan Gong. I represent the Outlying Islands district. Thank you for helping us solve our case. I will be nominating you for the "Good Citizen's" Award Well, I can't fight kung-fu, but I do know one or two things about making kung-fu tea. Come. Let's all have some tea to celebrate. Come. Where's the head? Can anyone recognise the person who killed Chairman Ma? There are four of you! Four pairs of eyes! And nobody caught a glimpse of his face? He was very quick! Very quick? Were you drunk? He was carrying a bag! What kind of bag? What kind? What colour was it? Hello? Boss. Something has happened to Chairman Ma. They took his head Find his head. We have to preserve his whole body! Yes, Boss! Keep a few people her to watch Chairman Ma. The others, follow me. No matter what. We must find Chairman Ma's head. Let's go. Wake up! Come and taste my Kung-Fu Tea. Here. This is yours. Here you go. Kiddo. Thanks. Cheers everybody. Thank you. There are loads more convicts here. Why aren't you taking them all if you're all that? Wanted: Timothy Ma. Mr good citizen. How Long have you been in Hong Kong? Two days What is your business on this island? I'm on vacation Where are you staying? I just checked out I already asked. Do you know how to write "death" in traditional chinese? Tarzan. There is no difference with "death" in traditional or simplified chinese. Cathing criminals is for those who've undergone professional training. A bit of Kung Fu is not gonna to take you anywhere What? You think you're a cat with nine lives? Are we clear? The police officer cannot hear you. I said, are we clear? I can't hear you. Speak up! Tarzan! What the hell is your problem? Did you pop the wrong pills today? No, Hiu. This type of guy, these brutes. They're bullies. They misuse their strength. They are dangerous. Keep your distance, Ok? And also, if there's anything out of the ordinary. Speak up! Get ready for dinner! OK. Maggie, could you please add another place and cook two extra bowls of rice I made the rice already. Come on, please. Guan Gong and I will help you. I don't have time. Here, take my seat. We will be eating very shortly. Waste of breath. You're really pathetic. I won't even let anyone sit down. And you let them push you around. You're terrible. Sir, there are no more rooms to rent. Sit down! No, Boss. You guys go look that way, we'll go this way. Let's go. He's like the plague. Even the light is broken. Stop checking yourself out! You'll never be as good looking as me. Now move over Fix the light. Call the electrician to come and fix it. You're crazy, I can fix it myself. Be careful! Move over, watch this! Wow! That was one strong kick. Are you alright? Arrest him! He's attacking the police! Hey! What are you doing? I feel much better, all of a sudden. What? Something wrong? Not bad! Come on, it's dinner time. You look violent even when you eat? Hey kid! Just because you don't want yours. Doesn't mean you should give him mine as well. It's alright! I'll just ask Maggie to cook more food. Maggie left! Are you messing with me? Is the taste too plain? No. It's OK. It's been a long time since I've eaten such spicy and tasty vegetables. Can't you eat spicy food? Who says I can't? If you can't take it, spit it out! I'm full! I'm full! So, how was your first meal at the jailhouse? Very satisfying! Well, eating it once is enough! As for those three thieves, they'll be eating it for a long time to come! As for you, kiddo. Lucky Bo was there. Next time something like this happen again, you must report it to me immediately. It was very dangerous. I am a police officer, why would I be scared? That's exactly what I feared. That you are not afraid of anything! If only you had gone with your mother to Canada, everything would've been fine. But no, you had to become a police officer. She has a family of her own. I don't want to get on their way. I was born and bred here, I mean, I speak Chinese. This is my home. Why should I leave? What about you? Where's your home? Yeah. I come from the grasslands (North Eastern China). I don't have anymore family. Oh, I know, you must be... One of those guys who rides his horse everywhere Kind of like a shepherd right? Something like that. Actually, we're just like you. We're orphans too. But orphans plus orphan equal family. Yes. Eat, it's very good. Look Uncle G. Let's cut the nonsense Just find me a place that is cheap, nice and spacious. Alright! I'll be waiting for your reply. I'll find you a place to live very soon. Here, drink some tea. Don't worry, I won't charge you a commission. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to Hiu! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday! Thank you! I chose this cake myself. Make a wish about me okay? Whatever. Good! Yes. Sorry you had to do the dishes with me. Well, I had a part in eating, so I have a part in cleaning. You got that right! Oh, by the way, thank you for cooperating with the police. Do you have to be so cool? You're cuter when you eat. You almost died back there. Weren't you even a little scared? Yeah! But, as a cop, you have to face your fears. It's our responsibility. Hey! What's that? A wolf's tooth. You like wolves? I respect them. They are the guardian spirits of the plains. We normally believe that when we die... The wolf can guide our spirit to heaven. What, so you worried about going to hell? Maybe! Come on, you're definitely going to heaven. You're a good person. Thanks. You know, I have a more practical guardian angel. You. Why don't I teach you how to protect yourself? Are you kidding? I should teach you few more moves or two. What are you doing? I'll arrest you for police harassment. I should arrest you first! When you're done with your cake, leave. This is a police station or did you think it was a resort? Let's go and file a complaint. Come on, let's go! Where? Next to Tien Hiu Temple Road. Mrs. Robinson again? Who else? What were you doing with him? Nothing, none of your business! Thanks for helping out Uncle G. Lunch is on me Alright, bye! Bo, alright. Come here... I found you two places. Both are in Tung Wan Both are two hundred and fifty. One has a TV, the other one doesn't... Thanks! Stop! Stop! Stop! Give it to me! Why did you grab my bag? Why are you running away? I am going home! Hiu, did you like the birthday gift I gave you? Yes, thanks, but next time don't waste your money. It's not a waste, as long as you liked it. So did you like it? Hey! So, what's the matter Mrs. Robinson? Who's disturbing you tonight? Those dogs over there! They have been barking all night. I can't sleep! Go and poison them for me! Mrs. Robinson, calm down now! We'll take care of it. You'll take care of it... You better take care of it or else I'll report you! So damn troublesome. Dogs are animals, they bark, what does she expect? They only bark when there are strangers. Hiu, did you see the present yet? What's the matter with you? What's going on? What are all of you doing here together? We are just avoiding the rain officer. What's on the ground? Stand over there! I said stand over there! Stand right there! Don't move! Boss! Have you found Chairman Ma's head yet? Not yet but Jellyfish is onto him. You must find Chairman Ma's head. I know, Boss! But... Chairman Ma is now inside the police station. What? They found Chairman Ma's body and brought it to the station. You idiot! Chairman Ma cannot stay over night at the police station! You have to get him out. Put the bag down Seriously Harrison, we have been brothers for over ten years now. You have to believe me on this one. I really saw Bo. Who beat you guys up? Hiu, did you see Bo? No. Guan Gong. This case definitely involves Bo! Why? When I was on site, I saw Bo's shadow. You saw Bo's shadow? No, seriously. Think of it. The two of us beat up three guys. So who beat up these two? Who has the best Kung-Fu on the island... And who else would come back to save her? You see, he couldn't has known. Where to go to save her. Unless he knew there was something going on. But he couldn't has known what was going on there. Unless he had something to do with it. I agree. Where's the proof? I want to file a report... What's the problem? Madam, I have been beaten... Calm down and speak slowly. What's the problem... One at a time. What's the issue? Let him go! Don't mess with me, I just want to take this body away. Hold your fire, it's gasoline! Don't move! Don't move! Stay calm! Let's go! Open the lock! Hurry up! Hurry up! Where's the body? Hey! Come help! Hold your fire, it's gasoline! Don't move! Get down! Get down... don't move! Officer Harrison! Tarzan. Are you OK? I'm fine You're all OK, right? No, we're fine. What's wrong? Do I look bad? You look great! You were brave as ever today. Special report. Typhoon Bo is steering away from Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Observatory has lowered the signal to a signal 3. All transportations will resume their normal operations shortly. Morning Sir! Is everyone here? Everyone is here, Sir! Let's go! Yes, Sir! At this point, nobody's happy. Including myself Now, what we need to do is... Bring this murderer to justice. Our source tell us that... This case involves an international drug ring. The deceased is Timothy Ma, also known as Chairman Ma. He is the crime syndicate mastermind, and is wanted by international authorities. Right now, his body is intact and his head is missing. Which means the murderer could be on the run with his head and still on this island. Involved in this case is another person. Who is managing Timothy Ma's death? I have reason to believe that... The gang who came to the police station to steal his body is linked to Chairman Ma's wife. Special report. A suspected murderer was uncovered in the Outlying Islands. Two officers were injured during the incident. One hour later, an attack occurred at the local police station One officer was killed. The marine police are on their way to the crime scene to assist further investigation. You over there! Police! Stop! Dispatch, suspect found. Black shirt, black trousers... Timothy Ma's wife Miho Sasaki While Timothy Ma was on the run. She took control of the crime syndicate. Unfortunately, we have no evidence against this woman. Because her record is cleaner than yours. ID card. Hurry up. What's inside this bag? Open it, let me take a look. Where do you live? I live in Kowloon. What are you doing here? Just visiting friends. OK So did you bring it or not? We need to handle this now. Hurry up and find Timothy Ma's murderer. Prevent any and all confrontation. Sir! I suspect someone. Attention all units... We have a suspect, male... Short dark brown hair, wearing army green jacket and black trousers. Speaks fluent Putonghua. You in the green jacket... stay right there! Don't move! Don't move! Now, put down your bag! Do you hear me? Put down the bag, faster! Both hands on your head. Don't move! -Let's go. Let's go. -Yes sir! Are you in a hurry to leave? The boat is here. Bo Tong Lam. If you did not break the law, you will definitely catch this ferry. Open the bag. I said, open the bag. Don't move! Kid Let's go Bo! Last night, officer Harrison... My condolences. Can you answer a question for me? Last night, the person who saved me at Tin Hau Temple Road... Was that you? No. Goodbye! Can I borrow your phone? Call me. Ok. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. Hello? Fat Wing. Boss. Where is he? I'm watching him. Don't let him escape. He won't escape. How much longer before the boat arrives? Did you hear me? How much longer? Fat Wing. Fat Wing, say something! I asked you how much longer? About half an hour. I want you to return my husband's head. I'll give you one day to leave Hong Kong. You haven't slept all night, are you tired? Do you think you'll be alive tomorrow? I ask myself the same question everyday, tomorrow... Will I still be alive? Don't worry. Everything will come to an end soon. Fat Wing. Help, help! I'm in here! Help him out. No need to help me. Hurry up, get the guy in the green jacket with the bag. Hurry up! Hurry! Hello. Hey kid. Our colleagues have discovered Timothy Ma's killer. Hey, you there? Who is it? We suspect it's Bo. Officers found Timothy Ma's head inside a bowling ball. He just escaped. Commissioner Yu wants you back in the station immediately. Drive. Please lend me your phone. How was your vacation? Pretty good. I heard a birthday song and made a wish. It's a holiday, you should be happy. Bo. Hiu Wor. I'm sorry, I'm keeping you from returning to the Police Station. With all the bad you've done, it's only a matter of time before we get you! Your friend is here, shall I allow you to arrest him first? How many do think he can take on? Fifty or a hundred? Bo! Quick! Get up! Bo! Quick! Get up! Bo! Bo, Run! Bo! Get up! Hurry, get up! Bo! Bo! Let me show you how it feels to be beheaded! Bo! Bo! Yesterday... was the... happiest day of my life. It was also my birthday. Eventually, he left. Just like the typhoon, leaving nothing behind. Nobody knows why he took chairman Ma's head. Some say it's a native custom. Until one day, I discovered a news story. One year ago, a nurse from a volunteer organisation Was abducted by drug dealers, whilst treating a patient along the Thai-Burma border. chairman Ma took her hostage and demanded the local government to release his party members from jail. In the end, the negotiations fell apart. Afterwards, I searched for more old news articles which were possibly related to him. Sorry. This is the only way I can repay you for saving me. Hey there! Long time no see. I've been busy. I hardly come this way nowadays. Shredded beef, less rice? To go please, thanks. Shredded beef, less rice. Fifty five dollars. What's with the leftovers, does my food taste bad? No, I'm just on a diet. On a diet? It'll be fifty five dollars. Don't lose too much weight, or the wind will blow you away. Right, as if! OK thanks, bye bye. If a person killed somebody who did something terrible... can we say that this person is providing for justice? Of course not, the law will decide the fate of the criminal. And you don't have the right to decide the life or death of a person.
