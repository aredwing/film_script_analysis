I got you a pass. It'll get you to the free zone. Contact my brother-in-law. He'll take you to Switzerland. Here are the papers and baptism certificates. Very good. Thank you. From now on you're not Bernstein, you're Gerard and Paul Louvier. Why? I already told you. - Say it. - I'm Paul Louvier. - Now you. - I'm Gerard Louvier. Shall we go? Sleep well my rabbit stews? My God! All our stuff was stolen! - When? - Last night! It could only happen to you! - What is it? - My hams were stolen. I said pack light. - I forgot my violin. - Stay, I'll get it. Only a kid could fit through! What kid? Look no further, father-in-law. Wait in the car. You're going on vacation? Yes, I'm going on vacation. Can I have a word with you, doctor? I don't want to keep you. My future son-in-law... It's about your children... The oldest one. Now, I'm not accusing him... This morning, I brought some scraps for my rabbits... I'm sorry, I must go. My ham was stolen last night! He must've heard about tomorrow's raid... I haven't a clue... I sent Mr. Batignole after him. Alright. It's my pleasure, Commissioner. What's going on? Nothing, my treasure. I'll make some coffee. What would he do with ham? We don't eat it! He can sell it. What are you implying? You think you're so high and mighty. Since you've been here, you barely say hello. You're a surgeon, I'm just a butcher, that's no reason to be snooty! I know I wasn't born under a lucky star! A yellow one? If people resent you so much, there's a reason. I saved your daughter's life. You were doing your job... And I paid you for your services. What's your husband doing? I hate to end this fascinating conversation. Will you open your suitcase? No. I'll call the police! - Kiss your vacation good-bye. - Wait! Dad! What are you doing? We're finishing up. Leave us! For God's sake, do as I say! Come in. Here. Shit! Here! And another up there! Run, David! Run! Go. Run. Run away, Simon. Run away! Let me go! Daddy! On the second floor, Commissioner. French police! Open up! Thanks a lot. It wasn't me... Open up! Police. - Where's the kike? - Don't know! - What are you doing here? - He was delaying him. Take them away. Thank you both for your help. I didn't do much. Participating is enough. Don't you agree? Absolutely. Thank you again. - Did he pay forthe ham? - No. - You dunce! - They'll pay when they return. That won't be soon. - Where are they going? - Compiegne, then Germany. - Theirthings are up there! - Not for long. Careful, it's fragile! Where is it all going? It's stored in Paris, and sent to Germany. And the apartment? An administrator handles it. If you'd like, we could benefit from this. I can pull some strings. We can't accept. It's 200 square meters... I don't want any trouble. When opportunity knocks, my husband ignores it. There's money to be made these days, but no! He's got scruples. "He's Got Scruples" Great title for a play! Get the first one produced. Sir? It's regarding the Bernstein apartment. Come in. - We have rice pudding. - No thanks. As you wish. I started by saying you were a hardcore anti-Semite... That you thought Germany and its culture was the future! I'm French nationalist all the way. I didn't stress that. I spoke of your artistic side... Your articles against degenerate art. I told him that to write your plays, you needed a calm, comfortable apartment. - And? - He's not against it. You're the best! Some "tea" forthe digestion? He wants to see you. I hear he's seeing some actress, she's a call girl... He wants to produce a play for her. And you'll write it. - When can I meet your colonel? - Tonight. Excuse me. Mr. Guitry, a table will be free in a few minutes. Sir! Excuse me, Sir. - Do I know you? - Pierre-Jean Lamour. I'm sorry... I sent you my play a month ago. My pen name's Francis Mozeur. Of course, Francis Mozeur... The renowned theater critic. He has a fatal machinegun style, like his initials. Initials? F.M. In otherwords, Frankly Mediocre. Yourtable Mr Guitry. - You're insulting me, Sir! - Yes. But that's not how I earn my living. - You know... - What! Forget it. So, about the colonel... Isn't that nice. It was a gift. Earned through another's loss. The tables are finally turning. I've never denounced anyone. We don't talk politics here. I'm speaking my mind. Be like me. Don't! Thank you very much. Have a nice day. Good night. See you tomorrow. I'm off to the movies with Pierre-Jean. - How are you getting there? - By metro. I'll drop you off. You can help me with a delivery. Yes, Daddy. - Feeling a bit flat, Paul? - Very funny. - What's playing? - "The Killer lives at n 21." There's a party at Colonel Spreich's afterwards. Spreich? The one who seized the Jews' furniture. You're invited? Nice one. Pierre-Jean's cousin knows him. I don't like this, Micheline. I'm just having some fun. - Your fianc, isn't. - Who cares about him. So drop him. He's moves in all the right circles. - All the doors open for him. - Doors can shut too. The Germans are here. You should benefit from it. I may be an old fool, but I fought the Germans... I've got a painful memento in my thigh... I won't kiss up to the Germans. What about the apartment? I don't want it. Don't bother peddling! We lived like sardines in 20 square meters. While they lived in the lap of luxury. It's on the upper floor, too. It's perfect for you. Think of the grandchildren... They'd have to marry. I wouldn't hold my breath. - They're engaged 2 years already. - She's using him. What about our customers? People are talking. People always have to eat. Dealing with the Krauts won't change the line at the door. Use your brain... If you still have one. Look, my little sausage! This place is a dream. Don't dream. It's not ours. It's not our home, and it's too big! Where did they go? Gone! They disappeared, like the French army. Applause! This is Paris! Here's the young author I told you about. Please, don't get up. I hear you're a budding young talent. And my faith is intact, too. My latest play. I autographed it. "A New Order." I know this play. You're in it. Do I come off as a buffoon? It shows your nation as the leader of a New Order... The future... The great Europe! You should change the title. I told you it wasn't a good title! It's only a temporary title. Everything's temporary, right Mademoiselle? Answer him. What about our other business? Yes, come to my office tomorrow. - Yes, Colonel. - 10 sharp. Great title! "10 Sharp." I can see the first scene... How about a little spin, Mademoiselle? - Is he after Micheline? - Forget it. He likes the way you criticize the Jews. I've been writing plays forten years. He wants you to take a more active stand. In return, Batignole gets the apartment. is worth the effort. Hold on. If I were you, I wouldn't hesitate long. I know Spreich. Like milk, he sours quickly. Need my glasses? Colonel Spreich will see you. Edmond, the little gift. Of course. I won't offend you by counting it now. You now live in 200 square meters. Thank you, Colonel. Thank your future son-in-law, Madam. He's a remarkable young man. He's a lovely young man. I was told by my administrator you're the best caterer in Paris. The best... He won the "Golden Tripe" in Caen in '36. His brother supplies him with pork. Black market? Small... very, small. You must think big. I've tried to drill that in to him. It's a friend's birthday tomorrow... Would you organize something? Prepare a nice buffet. Are you listening, Leon? I need eggs... Move over, Daddy! Butter, flour, foie gras... Goose pat, a dozen chickens. You could help! I'm ordering from my brother. What else? Smoked bacon. Talk about heavy. It's ugly too. I want something modern. When Dad starts making money... That'll be the day! Don't say that. He's on a roll. Let's hope it lasts. "Let's Hope It Lasts," great title! I see you work quickly. - What do you think? - A bit bare. But it has its charms... Take a look at your room Pierre-Jean. Separate rooms until we're married. - Delivery. - You were here yesterday. They say me come today. Your papers, please. Me, caterer for colonel Spreich, forthe... Speak normally. I understand perfectly. Come in. The bedroom's overthere. Any good furniture? Junk. Except for a new delivery van. Here's the beast. For your kids. - It needs a paint job. - Yeah. Edmond, come see. - What's this? - Look. You dreamed of it, Germany provided it. Rations for gas. This is too much. Careful, wet paint. Be right back. I'll get another one. You swine, neverthought my brotherwould be living here. Property is cheap these days. Like my produce. - I pay for it. - Then you hike up the price! Why don't you shout it out. I may raise my prices. - My expenses are high. - I see. - I'm just renting. - It's not free. Just about. - Cheers. - Thank you. Some champagne? We weren't satisfied with the last operation. We expected 30,000 Jews. The French police are doing their best. Do better, Pierre-Jean. Do better. We need an independent force... a militia working for our cause. We need money forthat. "Can I top you up?" What do you mean? It's a French expression. What's the French language? Gallic. The Gallic language barely has 20 words. In 10 years, French won't exist. Excuse me, Daddy. This is Edwige, my neighbor. Haven't we met already? At the premiere of "The Killer lives at n 21." "The Killer lives at n 21," Excellent title, don't you think Pierre-Jean? Excuse me... Edmond, the door! I've only got two legs. Is my daddy here? Daddy? My father. - Listen... - Why are you here? It's not your home anymore. Are those Germans? They're friends of Pierre-Jean. You can't stay. It's my home now... I have the papers. It's legal. Sorry, you have to leave. My things are in my room. My books, violin... It's all gone! - Where? - I don't know. The SS took it all. Why? I don't know. I don't make the laws. - What's your name again? - Simon. Go orwe'll both be in trouble. Can I have something to eat? It's been three days. - In the camp... - I don't want to know! I'll feed you, but not here. Go to the servant's quarters. Hurry up. Wrong apartment. How did you get here? They took us to a station. We were getting on a train. My dad said run. I ran. I didn't look back. - When was that? - 3 days ago. When I stopped running, no one was behind me. What did you do? I walked at night. Then a nice lady gave me money forthe train. Dad said to meet here. You misunderstood. Which room? Here. You can stay till morning. I don't want to see you afterthat. By helping you, I'm at risk. There's no heat? No. Why? - It's summer! - I'm cold. Sorry. No heat! Your dad decided not to heat the servant's quarters. How did your maid manage? Ask your dad when you see him. If I find him. You'll find him. - How? - Do you have family in Paris? Cousins, near Montmartre. He's probably there... I'll get some food. Could I have a drink? Yes, but stay right here! I'm locking you in. Just my luck. This is all I need! - Where were you? - Getting champagne. - Where is it? - I forgot the keys! Everyone's asking for you, Herr Batignole. Coming! You need a hand? No, my kitchen is my own domain. Get out! - What are you doing? - Don't mind me. - Hello, Paul. - Hello, sir. - Your studies going well? - Yes. Where's the bubbly! - I'm going! - Upstairs? I didn't want them stolen in the cellar. - You're white as a ghost! - It's nothing! - I'll get them. - No, you cut the cake! I'm coming. Not only do you just show up, but you've got lice! Where I was, there was only one toilet for200 people! One bar of soap cost the same as 100 bars... A cigarette cost one chicken. People paid for a puff. Business is business, everywhere. - It's cold. - I can shave it. - No. - Then stop complaining! What? What are you doing? I'm on the throne! Are you spending the day? However long it takes. Leave me alone! Your parents can't say I didn't take care of you. - Was it good? - I threw up in the bucket. What a waste of foie gras. Can I have some tea? I've been running up and down since 6 am! - Can you empty the bucket? - The toilet's out there! You locked me in and said not to move. Some day off! Hello, Paul. Did you rent your room? - No, why? - I heard some noise. My brother's son has typhus. You'd better stay away. Can I have a book? Pierre-Jean has books. I doubt you'd enjoy them. You don't read? I'm up at 5 am and don't go to bed till 10 pm. And I work non-stop in between. - I didn't know. - Now you do. If someone knocks, don't answer. What about my parents? We'll talk later. Here. They were mine when I was young. It's so humid. My legs are like lead. I feel a storm coming. Do you have lice? I was itching all night. So was your father. Your party was a success. Are you listening? Spreich should stop lecturing me. He wasn't happy with the round-up. But he does nothing. - Now they want kids! - That's different... How so? Don't you agree, Edmond? I wasn't following. He was speaking of Jewish children. Which ones? What a pig! Pork pat, dipped in coffee. Not in this apartment. You don't know what you're missing. Try it. - I'll pass. - You don't like anything. He loves Micheline, right? Absolutely... Since we're on the subject, may I have the honor of asking for your... Not that again! Why didn't you let him finish? It's not the first time he's asked. - He's so good to us! - It's my life! Hands up! Don't make us shoot... Too bad. - It's coffee? - I couldn't get tea. It'll settle your stomach. What's that? It's pork pat. My speciality. I don't eat pork. There's also homemade jam, good bread, real butter and an apple. - Will you see my cousins? - I'll call. Jews can't use phones. Everything's against the law for us. That's the Germans' fault. No, the French. We've had no phone for a year. We're not allowed good jobs. I know a Jewish butcher. All Jews can't do that job. Where are your cousins? You turned in my father. You knew the police were coming. Why would I do that? I'm in business, Simon. I like to make money. - You can make money that way. - Not me. You live in my home. - They made me. - Who? If I had denounced you... with the Germans last night, I could have done it again. You said we stole your hams. Why would I do that? You don't eat pork! My dad said you accused him. - Your dad made it up! - Are you saying he lied? I am not accusing anyone! Everyone lies... Me, my wife, your parents, the radio, the news... If everyone told the truth, we'd be at war! We are at war! Yes? - Hello Ma'am... - Sir? I'm looking forthe Cohens. Are you family? Not at all. Then what do you want? Mr. Cohen's a friend. A friend? An acquaintance of an acquaintance, of a neighbor in my building, on rue Sivel. Come in. - They do live here? - Not entirely. The parents are in Vel d'hiv. - The bicycle stadium? - Yes. They were arrested and taken there 3 days ago! They left a small token, but I can't keep them. Me neither! I have one in my cellar! A Jew? Bernstein isn't Irish. David or Simon? Bernstein. - There's tons of them. - Not on rue Sivel. - They're gone. - Not the one in your cellar! Listen, I came to find Simon's relatives. Since they're not here... They're your friends. - Who? - The Cohens. I don't know them! We know you. He's our cousin. There you go. I'm not Jewish. I've been French for ages. So have we. I can't keep them. A cop lives upstairs. I live with a collaborator! But you're hiding the kid. We all have our cross to bear. Red light, green light, 123... Simon! Come here now! It's slippery. That's the fun part. - You're nuts! - They're school friends. There are no friends during war. Did you find my parents? But I've been thinking... Before you were arrested, what was the plan? To go to Switzerland, with Mr. Morel. He smuggles Jews? I don't know. He makes head stones. There you go. Maybe your parents made it to Switzerland. Why don't I have any news? They don't know you're here, nitwit. I'll find this Morel guy. It can't be hard. And then? He'll take you to them. What if I don't find them? What if they were arrested? When you escaped... You didn't look back. Maybe you ran faster. Just because you didn't see them, doesn't mean they were arrested. But it's possible. It's possible, but maybe it isn't that bad. With Pierre-Jean around, I should know. They take you to Germany to break stones for roads. Do children break stones, too? Yes. Small stones with small hammers. You know I can't keep you here. In Switzerland... You'll have to pay Mr. Morel. Your dad already did. He'll say it's not true. He's no good. He took off when the police came. When did your father meet him? During the war in 1914. - Your father fought in the war? - Yes... I want to stay here. I can't keep you here. Here you're ticking a bomb, in Switzerland you won't explode. The kid's going to kill me. My rations haven't come in. Come back later. Anybody here? What do you want? I'm looking for Mr. Morel. What for? Business. The same forthe smuggler. You're quick. Paid on delivery. He's just a kid. The risks are the same. Here. Where did you get it? Someone owed me money... Some deal. Forthe other guy. It's fake. I don't believe it. Someone tried to pawn it off on me, too. Nice clients. Could be the same. Bernstein right? Something like that. He's got financial troubles. So he says. You ever seen his place? No. The furniture's not cheap. His Renoir is worth everything I own here! Renoir? It's a painting of a kid. Not bad. He should've paid you with that. Is a Renoir expensive? You idiot. Some go for a million. If I get the painting, will you take the kid? You want him gone? I want to save him. OK, but theirthings were taken when they were arrested. Really? A few weeks ago. You know how it goes. If I get the painting, will you take him? Yes or no? Sure, but you're taking a risk for nothing. For nothing? Not too thin. Look, that's 28 grams. Like I say, we lost the war, not our appetites. When you're done jabbering, can I pay? It's been hours. Here's your change. - Sorry. - Leave it. I'll sweep it up. Lost your keys? I rented my room to Edwige and her boyfriend. Really? When do we go? In three days, with Mr. Morel. He's a good guy. - Is it expensive? - It's nothing. He knows it's you. He said your dad paid a bundle. He did? Absolutely. You're in good hands. What if we don't make it? I'm not going. My business doesn't run itself. Are you done yet? Is that a German? What's going on? I told you. Got a problem Edmond? I'm fine! Not you. Someone's banging on the wall. It's my brother. He's very sick. Sick? Typhus. Typhus? You ruined my orgasm! It wasn't me, Colonel! - Nice work! - Can't a girl have fun? With a Kraut? - What about Pierre-Jean? - He's French! Sold out, like you! I don't sleep with the enemy! - Time to pay up. - No way. Who's in your room? - My brother. - Yesterday it was his son. There'll be nobody soon! Then you can rent your room to the German army! I don't trust Spreich. He could send his men up there. But he loves a French girl. It's no crime. It's disgusting, like Pierre-Jean and your daughter. She doesn't sleep with him. That's his problem. Why are they together? I wonder. Mind your own business. Into bed now. It's not ideal, but I'll feel betterwith you here. What about yourwife? There's only one key. Can you leave the light? Someone might notice. I'm scared of the dark. You're safe in the dark. - Edmond! - Coming! - What are you doing? - Storing champagne! - I'm not a pig! - You scared me. I'm bleeding! - You're drenched. - I'm bleeding! Get Doctor Bernstein! He's gone, my sausage. - Where are we? - His apartment. What's that noise? Pierre-Jean's typing. What's he typing on? On his typewriter. You're not well at all. You've no reason to be anxious. Calm down now. It's for my son-in-law. He's got business with Colonel Spreich. July... 9... 11... 14... July 15... Bernstein. Here it is. Max... rue Sivel. Taken between 9:17 and 11:32, by Colonel Spreich. Talk about precision, those Germans. It's regulations. All theirthings are in aisle 27. That's it. I've a list of furniture. What timing. It's going to Germany in 2 days. Section B is at the far end. It's incredible! You should see the pianos. Hundreds of pianos lined up. It's extraordinary. Incredible. Here it is. Bernstein. - What are you looking for? - A Louis XV chest. - It's not on my list. - But I saw them take it away. The officer in charge often helps himself. I'd check Spreich's office if I were you. He's a fanatic... for Louis XV. What can I say? I could've gotten a head start. As usual, you don't tell me a thing. I wonderwhat you do all day long? You think this stuff is heaven sent? Stop bickering. - It's heavy. - I don't have four arms. Don't get your hands dirty. "Don't Get Your Hands Dirty." Excellent title. How about "Lazy Bones" instead? I'll note that. - After my delivery, we're going. - You're coming too? No. I'm taking you to Morel. That's it. Move your junk. Air raids are expected and people use cellars. If they find you here, I'm finished. It's just a storm. Get the rest from the truck. Looking for something? Colonel Spreich. I thought I'd... You're bleeding. It's nothing. - I'll get a doctor. - Don't bother. Don't move. I'll be right back. I'm Edmond Batignole. You know me. Me come here every day. That was from before. Truck requisitioned by my son-in-law. Bad French paint, that's all. - Excuse me? - Papers forthe truck! Me French, not Jew. Understand? You can go. Colonel, this is Andrea. I think we have a problem with Batignole. We started eating. How was the delivery? I got it in early. Did you hear about your promotion? What's this? Edmond's to be Gestapo caterer. And the fool doesn't tell us. It's not official. They owe me. I've been footing the bill. It got you in the door. If there's no contract, I'm out. Don't be such a pig. The Krauts have been the pigs around here. Sorry, Pierre-Jean. Your scorn is appropriate. Besides, things can still change. Are the winds changing? Well Marguerite, scornful tones must now shift to more somber ones. Collaborating with the Germans is fine, if they respect us. We've done a fine job ridding the country ofJews and terrorists. Now Hitler must do his part. Absolutely. Let's raise our glasses to a new cleansed France, one that's serene and prosperous. To a revolution led by Ptain. Vive la France! Vive I'Amour. Let's have champagne! I'll get some. No! You're hiding something. You stop me every time. It's fishy. Remember, I put it upstairs. - You said you brought it down. - No. Up. - You bring it up, then down. - So? - Well it is odd. - What's odd! Are you OK, Edmond? He's never OK! It's her! - Daddy... - I've had it with her. That's a new one. It's not new. You yell constantly. Edmond, you've no guts, no brain. You're a pig! - Do I treat you like a fat sow? - Watch it! I'm ashamed of you! That's my problem. I am ashamed of you! - You're still making my life hell. - Not much longer! I'll get the champagne. Hold on. It's Colonel Spreich. He wants to talk to Dad. He seems upset. Yes, Colonel? This is Pierre-Jean. We're leaving... - What are you doing here? - Eating. No, them. They're my cousins. I'm already in deep shit, and you brought them here? I didn't go anywhere. How did they appear? Was it the Holy Spirit? You told our landlady Simon was in your cellar. We climbed through the opening. This isn't a summer camp! - Taste good? - I was hungry. Edmond. Who is it? Edmond. Open up! Leave me alone. Spreich called. He wants to see you immediately. He has a few questions. I'll go with you. - The Gestapo can't be good. - You can't refuse to see Spreich. He's suspicious lately. I don't know what you mean. Leave me alone. Open up! Daddy, let us in! Leave me alone or I'll hang myself! This is the champagne? I know you. Colette and Simone are Simon's friends. Little whores. Watch your mouth, Pierre-Jean. I put myself out so that you could live in a fine apartment. Got involved with the SS, and compromised my art forthis. Lowlife scum who sides with Jews. I wouldn't worry about your art. Even Sacha Guitry... I told Daddy about Mr. Guitry. Daddy's little girl tells all. How sweet. Call Spreich. Get him here! - They're just kids. - Obey me! If you're still my daughter, don't listen. He's the one who denounced your family, Simon. He told the police. This time the SS will be coming for you. - You say you're not a puppet. - I'm doing my duty! You vermin aren't going to a camp. You'll go directly to Germany in cattle cars. Everybody upstairs! Move! We listen to Mr. Edmond. Tell them to go upstairs. Do what he says. He's sick. I warned you. That's an excellent title! Excellent title. You've got 5 seconds, or I'll butcher you. Please, Daddy. We'll go, Edmond. Who, Marguerite? Who? Daddy found him - Where's your father? - At the police station. Will you take hostages? If you don't find the guilty party? Pierre-Jean was a minor French collaborator, not a German officer. He was more than a son to me. We'll find the person who did this. And he'll pay dearly. Skin him alive! - Keep the change. - Thanks. - Open up. - Now what? Open up. Where did you two disappear? They came to see their cousin. A man wanted to take us to a camp, but he saved us. He killed the man with an ax. I neutralized him. - Then he won't die? - Of course not. The hospital will sew him up. Ask Simon. His father knows. You must hide us. Just tonight. I can't turn you out. Thank you. Want a drink? I'd be delighted. It was Mr. Bernstein's. His son said he got it from you. Max never finished paying for it. Max was arrested with his wife and son. I need cash to get his other son to Switzerland. There are other kids too. Congratulations. I can sell it somewhere else. - I came to you. - You have no one else. I'll give you 300,000. It'll get a million on auction. It won't go on auction for another2 or3 months. And you seem in a hurry. Do you have cash? Wait a moment. - May I use your phone? - Certainly. Is your mother alright? She's busy. All of Vichy Paris has come out for Pierre-Jean. It's his moment of glory. - The SS is investigating. - Who do they suspect? Since you left, they have doubts. Especially Spreich. I heard you rummaged his office. He wants to make you talk. Says you're a Gaullist. Here's 150,000 francs. No questions. I want you both to stay with my brother in Normandy. What about you? I'm taking the kids to Switzerland. I'm sorry about Pierre-Jean. - I had no choice. - Yes you did. You killed him after he alerted Spreich. You could've left. You think he would've let me go? He would've butchered the children. Don't say you loved him. When do you go? Tonight. When will I see you? I don't know. I'll call you in a few days. Why can't a professional take them? Can't trust them. It'll be good to take some time off. There'll be identity checks. We'll take the night train. It's safe. We get off at Morteau. Just before the free zone. Here are your papers. What about the kids? Simon has his fake passport. - He's clever. - And the others? I'll work it out. You won't go farwithout a pass. I've no choice. Can't vouch forthe quality. Smile forthe birdie. You know I love you. Me too. Be careful, Daddy. Ask for a reduction. What do you think I did? How much is that? Slow down. And the girls? They're my daughters. Their papers? Of course. Here. Their passes were stolen. You can go. Thank you so much, Sir. Go to sleep now. May I buy some bread for my kids? Of course. What do you say? Thank you, Madam. - Some cheese? - Thanks. - Some sausage? - No. They're not fond of meat. Forget it. - Is it good? - Yes. - Where are you going, Daddy? - Men's room. What does he do? He's a surgeon. That's a nice job. My Dad... He's a doctor. Gerard just said so. Listen when I talk. How old are you? Eleven and a half. I'm 8 and my sister's 11. Only 6 months apart? That was Dad's 2nd marriage. Right. Your mom's not here? We're meeting her. In the free zone? Just before. We're going to Morteau. Another check point. My tummy hurts. Let's go through the toilets! Me? Thanks. Your son said you were a doctor. It's true, Daddy. He says he fell when he got off the train. That hurts? It's normal. That joint's full of nerves. With the shin twisted, it doesn't look good. I'm afraid I can't help you. You must go to the hospital for an operation. Repair it! Now! Repair it. Naturally. I'm a nurse, doctor. Good timing. I forgot my medical bag in Paris. I see. Was she in our compartment? You'll be fine. His knee is twisted. I see that! First we'll ease the pain. What a wimp! Do you speak German? Yes. English and a little Russian, too. Here doctor. Sorry. - What are you doing? - I'm giving a shot. It's an intravenous shot. Oh right. In Paris, I'm chief surgeon. The help administers the shots. That'll do it. Go ahead, doctor. Yes, the knee. - Want me to do it? - I know my stuff. Guess it's painful. They didn't even check our papers. Put a lid on it! - Thank you. - Thank your son. Have a nice trip. If anything happens to the kids, call a real doctor. Relocating a knee is a cinch. I did the same for calves as a kid. I could've been a vet. Is Switzerland very far? - My stories aren't interesting? - They are. I don't think so. - Can you carry me? - Yes. - I'm hungry. - Me too. You've got fat reserves on you. - You ate on the train. - Not much. The landlady in Paris made us a snack. - I forgot it. - That was clever. Did you remember? All he does is act like a clown. I got us out of the station. We were lucky to find a wonderful nurse. She didn't speak German. It was obvious he twisted his knee. I found out she was a nurse. When you went to the toilet, I did some research. - Would you shut up. - I'm explaining. You run off at the mouth like my wife. I'm thirsty. Let's move. There's a farm. I'll get some food. Wait for us. - Wait here. - I'm coming. No! Stay with your cousins. Bring something to drink. Very funny! How do you know German? - It's my native language. - Was your mother German? My mother's French. My father's German. We left when I was born. You said your father fought in WWI. That means with the Germans? I guess so. So the shrapnel in my leg... the shell that hit the mess hall could've been sent by your dad. He wasn't fighting. A shirker. He helped the sick. I was on the front. You said you were a cook. In the trenches, in the midst of bombs and bullets. You don't know how lucky you are. Darn flies! Daddy said to talk nicely to them. That's sweet. Aren't we having a fun here? Fresh air, peace and calm. No Germans. The good life. Vacation. - I'm hot. - Take off yourtop. Forget it. Show your boobies. You're so stupid. It won't get betterwith age. Just kidding, Simon. You annoy me! - Now what? - Time for a nap. Smart move. Didn't eat enough? I wanted dessert. Dessert! - That's stealing. - It's no problem. It's me again. Do you know her? She sold me the cheese. Was it any good? - Yes. - Yes, what? Yes, ma'am. Where are you? With Gerard. I'm coming. How many do you have? Three. Where are you from? Paris. We're going to Switzerland. She's talking to me! He'll get me hung. You're not the first I've seen in these parts. Do they get through? Depends on the smuggler. - Do you know any? - Enough Gerard! - Stop yelling. - Be polite! Can we talk privately, because with him... Have some juice at the house. Get your sisters and bring my things. Then meet me at the house. - Do you hear? - I'm not deaf. Hello. - Is my father here? - He's talking to my mother. My sisters: Colette and Simone. - Hello. - What are you doing? Making a sling to kill crows. Why? I eat them. - What's your name? - Martin. I'm Gerard. Is this smuggler reliable? Yes. Until now. I don't know how to thank you. Drink while it's hot. I'm sure it's better in Paris. Where can I find a hotel? I can put you up for a night. Is it OKwith your husband? He's a prisoner in Germany. I'm sorry. You didn't know. I'll call the Parnets. Let the girls have your room. You two take the room upstairs. My other son lives in town. Where's he sleeping? You could sleep on the sofa. That'll be fine. I'll pay you. - No. - It's the least I can do. Keep your money. I'll be back in an hour. Can you kill a rabbit for dinnertonight? I'll handle it. - You do this every night? - Morning and night. And if you don't? They explode. Taste it. - It's hot. - It's not coming from an icebox. He's moving. It's the nerves. Didn't your dad teach you that? No. You've never seen this before. Come here, I'll show you how to skin it. Now we'll take off his pajamas. You're a monster. We'll talk when you're eating it. I'll never eat it. Guess you've never been hungry. Actually, I have. That's just it. It was only 2 or3 days. You pathetic man. - Alright! My turn. - I'll put the bottle back. Watch it, I'm coming through! Don't aim for people. It's delicious. Bravo! - Not eating? - I don't like rabbit. - Taste it first. - It smells bad. I made it. Of course, I can't cook. Whatever I do isn't good enough. Can I eat his portion? No. He won't leave the table until he's eaten. You must give me your recipe. It's a first for rabbit. It's not rabbit, it's cat! Watch your step, Simon. Isn't it Gerard? The idiot makes things up. I'm not an idiot. Don't give me orders. Who do you think you are? I've had it! You called me Simon! Don't talk back! - I've had enough of your yelling. - Me, too. When I find my father... I hate you! You're a big fat idiot! Want another? Brat! Don't listen to Gerard. It's rabbit, not cat. That's not why she's crying. Don't you start. She's exhausted. Come on, Colette. I'll tell Sarah to come up. Stay with me. Sometimes I slap Martin, too. That doesn't mean I don't love him. Your brother doesn't seem easy to handle. He's not my brother. I said he was my father to trick the enemy. - Who is he? - A goy. - A what? - In yourterms, a non-Jew. He's a neighbor. His name's Batignole. My parents were arrested because of him. What's that? A smoke. Want some? It's strong. You were saying... About Batifiole? "Batignole." He stole our apartment. He's got our money. Did he steal a lot? He's got 130,000 francs in his bag. I counted it. He'll probably lose you in the mountains and keep the money. Take another hit. It's not so bad. Go on. When I got home, he had the Nazis there. Last month, a guy like him was dealing with the Krauts. He was strung up by his feet, they slashed his balls and let him bleed. Who killed him? - The guys in the Resistance. - Of course. Do you even know what the Resistance is? They kill people. Not just anybody. The Krauts. Or other scum. Like your so-called father. Know anyone in the Resistance? Plenty. Do they have guns? A lot. They come from America. What do they have? Machine guns and canons. What about planes? Planes and tanks. How do you know? - Can you keep a secret? - Sure. My brother. He's one of the head guys. He's gonna kick the Krauts out of France and free my father. My parents, too? Yeah, but first we have to kill bastards like Batignole. We need him to help us go to Switzerland. My brother can take you. Those are my dad's glasses. They're getting some use. Night, Mom. Good night. - You smoked. - I didn't. Liar! I can smell it a mile away. Up to bed. Good night, son. Kids aren't easy. The girls don't give me too much trouble. The boy's causing me grief. I shouldn't have slapped him. - He'll live. - You're right. - How can I say... - I know. They're not your kids. It was just by chance. You're very courageous. That was by chance, too. But here I am. I have laundry to take in. That's dry. Into the basket. That's dry. That's dry. And that? Martin, I just wanted to say... Batignole did help us, too. Once a bastard, always a bastard! Don't let yourself get mushy. Tomorrow we'll see my brother in Bizot, and by noon, Batignole will be strung up. Look Daddy, I found a snail. Wonderful. Did you sleep well girls? No. Simon threw up all over. I'll see how he's doing. He left with Martin this morning. I told him not to leave. I said that, too. - Where did they go? - I don't know. Simon took your bag with the money. - Why didn't you tell me? - Where were you? Where did you sleep? I slept outside. Why didn't you dummies tell me? - I'll see if they're any eggs. - Me too. - Stop copying me. - What you do is so interesting. Did you and your cousins come alone from Paris? No. They came with some guy named Batignole. He's a lowlife collaborator. Tell him what you said last night. Did you kill a collaborator? That's what you told me. Is it true or not? Back to business. What do you have? Not much. You said you had 130,000 francs. I need some for later. How about 50,000? For my cousins too? Yeah. Is it a deal? And you kill Batignole? Don't bother. He's a bastard. Pierre-Jean was the real bastard. He was the collaborator. Batignole killed him. He's part of the Resistance, too. Last night you agreed. Last night I was schlamiel. That means I was stupid. Last Yom Kippur, I smoked, I drank and I danced on the table. It was the same last night. I smoked yourthing. I was just babbling. Batignole's a nice guy. Not a lot of French help us. They denounce us. I gotta go. Come on. Come with me! You stay. We don't know you. French police. Come with me. Not so fast. What do we have here? Who's that guy? - A spy. - Where's he taking him? - To the cops. - Do something. What can I do? You're part of the resistance. You want me to attack with Dad's rifle? You said you had machine guns. We're just getting started! At Deedee's party, you said you had tanks. I was drunk. - I told Simon. - You shouldn't have. - I look like an idiot! - Go home and forget it. You asshole! Edmond, hurry! What's going on? My cousin's chief of police in Bizot. Simon's at the station. - What's he doing there? - I don't know. Bring his papers. They want to check them. Thanks. - Can I borrow your car? - If you can find gas. You think it's clever to take your father's money. Why did you take it? I don't know. - Who were you giving it to? - Nobody. So you were stealing it! Here's the kid I told you about. What's your name? Gerard Louvier. He's a good kid. - I'll leave you. - Thanks. - Hands made forthe piano. - I play violin. I got an award at the Conservatory in Mrs. Rosenfeld's class. I've been with her for 5 years. Is your dad a musician? He owns the Batignole butcher shop. He was catering for German officers. A collaborator? A real one. Is that your father's name? No. Louvier. The Batignoles are the old owners. My father's name is Louvier. Edmond Louvier. Rue Sivel. We're on vacation here. They're staying with my cousin. They come once a year. They're good people. Daddy! - What are you doing? - I'll tell you later. You really scared me, Gerard. He's a menace. Kids, you never know what gets into their heads. Let's go. Hold on. - May I see his papers? - Of course. - Wait for me outside. - No. Thanks. - And yours? - I wasn't told to bring them. He's my father. The resemblance isn't striking. He's the image of his mother. My wife died last year. I know them. They go to my cousin's every year. Fortheir health. Does your cousin knowJews? - We're not Jewish. - Your son was stopped in a caf, because he was talking in Jewish terms, where he was acting like a fool. What were you doing? Answer Simon! - Simon? - His second name. A Jewish name. - I didn't know that. - And "schlemiel"? Schlamiel is German for jerk. He must've heard it at a German party. I organize buffets. I'm a butcher. I told you he worked with Germans. With the French, too. I have a buffet for200 people coming up. High-level administration people. Wait in here. One last question. Does your son play music? Absolutely. What instrument? The violin. He's constantly bending our ears with it. - No talent? - You said it. He said he was at the top of his class. A small local school. I preferred the accordion, but since his mother's a violinist. Isn't she dead? Isn't yourwife dead? It's as if she's still alive for me. Such a wonderful woman. You know the way life is. His teacher's name? Your son's violin teacher's name. What does that mean? Why don't you have him drop his pants! You're clever and like all businessmen. You probably have all the right certificates indicating he's had an operation. What I want to know, since he's your kid, is the violin teacher's name he's had for 5 years. You must know it. I knew the French police were bad, but it's beyond belief. That's your answer? I just sold my shop. I've got cash. Take it. That's my only response. You sold your business, but you're catering for200 in a week? You're implying Jews are liars? I've heard that for years, been subjected to it. The kikes do this, the kikes do that. First they took away my phone, then the radio. I wasn't allowed to work. Then I had to wear a star, but that wasn't enough. The French police took my wife, my brothers, my cousins. They gave my apartment to a French couple. My furniture was seized, all I owned was stolen. I sold a small painting to get this money. Apart from my kids, it was the only thing of value. I'm not a butcher. I'm a doctor, a surgeon. I saved tons of idiots like you. I served in the French army to help liberate my country. So that you could live freely. We've been here for 50 years. I've been a law-abiding citizen, paid my taxes. The State uses my taxes to pay salaries for people like you. And this is the thanks I get? You treat me like a sub-human. Who's the sub-human here? Call the Commandant. But, Lieutenant. Do it! Hands up! Get your hands up! Hey, mister! Are you alright? What are we doing here? Forthe love of God, keep quiet. Father. You're supposed to help us cross the border. I know. Wait a moment. - He's taking us? - Were you expecting a rabbi? - What happened? - Problems. We've got to go. Irene spoke of 2 other girls. They're at the farm. I'll warn them. I'll get them. I don't know. Calm down. Hide in here. - Gentlemen? - Good evening. Seen anything unusual? A man with a mustache, balding, around 50, with a child. I haven't seen a soul since confession. What did he do? He's a Jew. With his son. Sorry I can't help you. Good evening, Father. - Sorry to bother you. - Don't worry. It's OK. Stay here until it calms down. Then go to the farm and I'll get you in the morning. - Excuse me, Father. - Yes. I hope Irene won't have problems. Don't worry. I'll lock you in. Why did you go into town? I don't know. What about the money? Martin said you wanted to stay with his mother. I thought I had to find someone else to help us. You're crazy, Simon. I can't wait to get you to Switzerland. I'm thirsty. We found nobody. Same here, chief. Watch your step. Was I supposed to know they were Jews? Am I to be hung for renting 2 rooms? The law is the law and ignorance isn't acceptable. Night, Irene. Good night. The imbecile's gone. Now we wait forthe Father. Are you alright? They're sleeping. I'm hungry. Any rabbit left? Yes. Let's get going. See you later. Bye, Martin. Bye, girls. Good-bye, Irene. Bye, Martin. Have a safe trip. Bye. This is for your brother, so he can buy a tank. We've got to go. Bye. This is it. You're in Switzerland. We made it! Listen carefully. Go to that house. Mr. Blanchard knows you're coming. He'll take you to the next village. Then to the Red Cross in Lausanne. You're safe now. See, I worked it all out. This is good-bye Guila. Good-bye Sarah. Good-bye Simon. Thank you, Edmond. I should thank you. Get going. They'll be patrolling the area. Take this. Take care. Go on! Let's go. Go ahead. Don't wait for me. Thanks, Father. - Are you coming? - Yes, I was thinking... You need help with the language. You speak German, English and Russian, but not Swiss. They speak French. - No, they speak Swiss. - What does it sound like? It sounds like "Theese." How do you say hello? Hello, you say "Haylooo." And a car, that's a "karrre." A "karrre." Now you're getting it. Edmond, Sarah, Guila and Simon stayed in Switzerland until the end of the war. Simon, Sarah and Guila never found their parents. Adaptation: Pamela Grant
