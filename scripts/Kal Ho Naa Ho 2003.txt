Every breath of the city...every heartbeat is filled with speed People are always in a hurry here... in a hurry to leave home...in a hurry to reach the office... always in a hurry to be a step or two ahead of life There is no place for anyone who can't cope here Miles away from lndia, this city is infested with lndians In fact they say every fourth face in Newk is an lndian One more thing... Oh... by the way that's me!. This city taught me to be independent... it taught me to fulfill my responsibilities... taught me to face life... ...but it couldn't teach me to love... where was the time? Whenever I watched the city from far... I felt Papa was closer Whenever I missed him, I came here I am Naina Catherine Kapur and this is my story I understand Mr.Shah, but try and understand my problem I must have the loan extension, please. I know the restaurant is centrally situated. But there's competition around, Mr. Shah... My mother, Jennifer.

Come on, come on. And Naina, please leave my hand... what will people say? May I sweet heart? Aman Mathur's magic was spreading in all the directions... whether they liked it or not, Everyone was being swept off their feet On Aman's insistence Dadi, Kammo and Vimmo had given up their music... and had embraced a new passion to... ... Kill us... Allah... Kill us... Excellent, what a performance! And while this was the situation upstairs... downstairs was a cookery special... Half a spoon... No... Full spoon... Half...- Full... What are you...? Aman could do anything... anything Gia's perfect family had a new entry I love you. And as for me...

I need some more time No... you can't get time The restaurant is going to shut... You have to order now I'm not talking about the restaurant... It's not the time to joke It's a serious problem.

It's our family problem That's why I'm saying But we aren't...- Shut up specsy. Jenny, this restaurant of yours doesn't run... it shouldn't Why should it? Just tell me what is available in this restaurant... that isn't available anywhere else on this street? Zero. Come here... Why does that Chinese restaurant do so well? Indian-Chinese Brother Brother... Bye Bye Bloody fools The bloody fools' restaurant works... because they have got their culture and their country to this place... Did I say wrong? - Not at all! We should do the same We have a great advantage which we must make use of being lndians. We must get lndia to Newk. Yes, including, Gujarat. - Yes I'm with you. Right on. We have to get lndia here... bring it to this small street... spread it in all the directions. I don't believe this nonsense. - I told you to shut up.

Eyes... have you seen your mother's eyes? There's a lot of pain in them Whatever I have done, it's for those eyes You know I have a problem I can't see any mother's sorrow or pain Because Mothers are strange When God made them, he gave all things that were meant to be here... here... in their hearts... So this is where they think from, understand and love And they have another problem too They listen to others' conversation and start crying at the smallest things Mine must be crying right now Crazy! What do you mean heee heee? I did so much for you... at least say Thank You... Thank you. Specsy! Naina... Naina... Naina What happened, Naina? I can't see anything! Oh! Now? What's going on?

What's to ask? My answer is 'Yes'... - Uh?

Something has happened... something surely has happened Have you fallen in love? There's no such thing called love. If there's a marriage it's always...arranged! Love? the body does not know to love. It only knows hunger... hunger for lust! Love...Love is Yash Chopra's songs. Love...Love is...to chill Love...I'll just tell you... Something has stirred... something surely stirred In the last couple of days, I've felt as if... everything has changed... everything is new Something has stirred... something surely has stirred I keep things somewhere... Absent-mindedly... when I'm all alone... So different now... are my traits Something has stirred... something surely has stirred Ever since I have found my heart melting... my mood has been swell too I meet everyone... I'm happy... with whatever I've found Something has happened... something surely has happened I find sparkling colours... My path strewn with stars... Roses I now find so much more beautiful As if the air too... were filled with a fragrance Something has happened... something surely has happened I take better care of myself I keep wondering... Whenever I see mirror... I check out my appearance This face of mine... now breaks into a smile Something has happened... something surely has happened This is a high we both feel. It's a wave we both flow with Make what you will... this is love indeed I have found love... and lost my heart Something has happened... something surely has happened" Love... when in love everything begins to look beautiful Every dream seems to come true All your goals change direction Even the wind changes its course... eyes search for colours... and now even red starts to look nice... every moment...every time... always... there's only one name on the lips Sweetu, Sweetu, Sweetu...

I can be a bit rude. She got angry... she left home... and came to Newk Her parents live here. My mother and I followed her here To take our Priya back home But she's still angry with me She says she needs more time But I know everything will be alright You know how it is? Ins't she so pretty? Yes... Why are you crying? Oh god, all you women are the same... Don't worry, everything will be alright I'm telling you everything will be alright! Can I go? Please stay, Priya... - I mean Naina I'm really sad... Me too... I'm going Flowers?

Naina... it's raining outside... why don't you take this towel? Bye Aman...- Bye... You love her, don't you? Who? There's no such thing. I don't love Naina... But when did I say Naina? I don't love her! I'm your mother. You can't lie to me So what do you want me to do? Tell her the truth? When you can't face the truth after knowing everything... how will Naina bear it? What do I do Mom? What do I say? How do I say that for the first time this heart is beating for someone... is breathing someone's name... for the first time this heart has loved someone... how do I say... Naina the love from this heart is very strong... but the heart itself is very weak How do I give her my weak heart, Mom? How do I tell her... that the girl in the photograph is not my wife... that she is my friend...my doctor... who's fighting day and night just to keep me alive for a few more days? I'm dying Mom... That's not true... That's not true... Priya said a transplant is possible After that everything will be alright... Everything... everything will be... alright... I'm your son, Mom... You can't lie to me No... Mom...Please. if you become weak... who will give me strength? Please mom. I will hide my tears and pain... but will you be able to hide your love? It's not my love anymore. It's someone else's I just have to reach it to the right destination That's my only dream now And He has to fulfill this dream for me He has to Priya, I want to ask you something Tell me the truth Do I have very little time? Ah! Aman, you know... That stupid face... How do you make that face? I have tried so many times... Is it Doctor's special? Aman, be serious. - Okay, I'm serious. What did you tell Naina? - What's to tell Naina? Actually Naina has a mental problem She thinks whoever she loves leaves her and goes away If I leave her too she will go insane She's half way there anyway And anyway, you know the effect I have on girls I'm so sexy, baby. Except me... of course Yes... That's because you are taller It will take time but will definitely have an effect You really love her, don't you? - I do. I can't believe it. I have known you for so many years but I have never seen you like this How did you manage this? It's kind of strange. All my life I ran away from love And now when life is running away from me, I have bumped into love Tell me the truth, Priya... Do I really have very little time? Can't anything be done? Tell me the truth, please Aman... as soon as you get a donor... Aman, it's really not funny. It's really not funny. - Give me a hug. No.- Come on. How will it have effect otherwise? Long hug from a long lady. Come on. Please, give me a hug. Is it having any effect? While it was a season of heartbeats at one end... it was a season of heartbreaks at the other One was my heart... the other was Gia's whose Aman had turned out to be married I love you, Aman. And poor Rohit... Even Laila had found someone But the greatest heartbreak was... He doesn't love me, Naina. Sweetu, don't cry. Relax. Everything will be all right He doesn't love me...He says he's confused Silly boy. I don't blame him. How rude is that. He wants to leave for London... to join some bhangra group Bhangra group? Yes... and do you know the name of the group? 'Forget Daler... Watch us' What kind of a name is that? Tissue...thank you. And while we youngsters were nursing our heartaches... the elders were finding their mates Can you believe it? Those stupid red roses were back in my house Enough is enough. And if red roses were in the house... the red dress was out! Hi, I'd like to return this sorry, not my color. Not mine either. So... you didn't like it? No, And you?- No Nice dress. - Nice tie. Oh... What happened with Aman? What? He's married? Why didn't you tell me earlier? If I had known earlier, would I fall in love? Now? What now? First I couldn't fall in love... and now I can't fall out of it But I have to... Or else me and my heart will feel lonely You will never be alone. I will always be there Why are you being so nice to me? Well....I'm a nice guy. Had you loved me, your heart wouldn't break That's the problem with you. You never take me seriously But when are you ever serious? Right now! You don't really mean that... - Not at all. You think you will ever fall in love with someone again? My silence said it all... and Rohit realized that his first love... has to be forgotten I have to forget my first love I have to forget my first love. It's not easy. It's not that easy to forget your first love My first love... Dev Anand! My first and last love... Lajjo My first love...- Lovechand... Kukreja... - You too! My first love...

I don't understand this... How did you let go of Naina so easily? Look at you... Ladies & Gentleman... Welcome to Lalaland. Rohit loves Naina... Naina doesn't love Rohit She loves Aman But Aman tells Rohit that he shouldn't let go of Naina so easily So basically Aman is... insane! Who are you talking to? I haven't gone insane Your brains have been displaced Naina hasn't fallen in love with me She just thinks that she has fallen in love with me. She thinks... Ah... she thinks! Now what is 'she thinks' supposed to mean? Man... I am a new entry into her life I just laughed a little with her, made her smile... and she thought she is in love with me While you have known her for years... she takes you for granted... now she is not going to dream that you are in love with her Now just forget all this friendship nonsense and show her some love man... whether she says 'yes' or ' no' leave it to her But at least give her a choice... You keep running after that Chameli... Lily... - Camilla... But you know Camilla has sexy legs. - What legs man... Shut up! We are talking about Naina - Sorry focus on Naina. Naina! Naina's beautiful eyes! Naina's lovely face Naina's fury... Naina's love... Naina's smile... Whenever she does, that is Naina's hair... when she ties them up like this Actually I like her hair all let down Why are you saying, Naina? For you... I'm married! And what if you weren't? Then I wouldn't let go of her. I'm not an idiot like you I am talking about Naina. You are right! Now what do I do? - You don't do anything Now whatever has to be done, I will do You just do as I say I have a plan... six days and girl in your face... Just six days. Wow! But why six days? Because I don't work on Sundays DAY ONE Naina waits for me everyday here at 6 p.m. We go together from here to the class But you won't go with her today - Why? Because I say so Is your plan to bring us together or throw us apart? I have a theory about girls The more you run after them, the more they will run away from you But if you run away from them they will be confused and will run after you... to find out the reason for their confusion And we have to take advantage of such a confusion of a confused girl... Even I'm confused! That you are... from childhood! That can't be helped... but trust me... do as I say Put this into your ear Put it where?- In your ear This device will be attached to the phone... so that I can speak to you constantly Whatever I say or do... you should do Got it? Rohit come in please. - Alfa Bravo Charlie, I read you. I have reached the college Good Soldier, Now relax at ease... at ease. Loosen your tie For God's sake, change your walk Walk?- Yes, your walking style. I mean cool walk, you know? Have you reached the classroom. - Yes So stop shaking, idiot! Can you see Naina? Yes...- Shut your mouth, duffer Go and sit next to her but don't speak to her Where were you? I was waiting for you for over half hour You are always late. I just don't understand this. Don't look at her... Don't... Look up... Iook down... Look to the side... Not her side, idiot... the opposite side! I'm talking to you... what has happened to you? Are you ill?

Not mine, you dumbo... Tell her that Hi, It's my birthday. - Hi, Happy birthday. Now push your cheek ahead Did Naina see that? Now hold her...Hold her tight... Hug her... Don't let her go Sorry. Over & out. DAY THREE Hello Rohit!- Yes, come in Aman. Rohit!- Yes. - ldiot. Do you want to say something? You won't attend class today - Ok.... No... I want to go to the class today Your plan is all rubbish! I haven't spoken to Naina since three days... Even I haven't spoken to Naina for three days But you are not the one in love with her, stupid! Don't worry. Now when Naina calls you... you will not speak to her No... I will speak to her. - No, you won't Yes I will... - No, you won't Naina, I love you... Sorry. It's your mother See? It's mothers who always run to rescue Mummy, I love you. Sorry, yes Mom... I have taken the medicine Why should I lie? Mummy, Bye... Bye... And what is that? Those are two fingers what else? Sorry man, I asked. See...? Naina didn't call. You don't worry. I know Naina She will wake up from her bed, she will pick up the phone to call... but her ego will stop her She must be missing you. So she will get up again... She will pick up the phone again. She will curse you twice... Idiot...Moron... - She'll definitely make a call. I don't believe you... that must be your mother again! Don't make fun of my mother! - What did I say? Aman, give it to me. - No...never. Oh my god! What happened to her - I don't know Oh no. Today you will speak to Naina And you will say what we discussed... Understand? Hi Naina..- Hi Lee. Thank you for your notes. You are welcome. DAY FOUR One second... one second... How far can you run from me darling? Leave my hand... Just leave my hand I don't know what's happened to you, I think you have gone mad For the past three days, I have been trying...Where were you, Rohit? When I needed a friend, where were you? I'm tired... I'm really tired of being your friend What?- What? What? When you want to laugh, it's Rohit... when you want to cry, it's Rohit But when you have to love, it's someone else! It's not going to work anymore, right? Are you alright, Rohit? - No, you listen to me, Okay. We are friends, right? - Yes... So a very intelligent man has said that the first step to love is friendship... and the last step is friendship too It's the middle that's left Take a step Naina and you will find your path Think....Naina... think... And to think I give you... my entire life Wonder what Rohit meant That day I felt Rohit had ceased to be my friend... he had become something else And what that 'something else' was... I didn't know... Didn't know... DAY FlVE. Hi Sweetie, how are you doing? This is for you What's in it? My heart... Just kidding! Nice dress. The red in here is the colour of my heart On you I'm sure it will look smart It's not a gift... it's something I don't know what to call... Isn't Subhash Ghai's film called 'Taal'? P.S.

Look, I can't do that ' Dandia' Okay. So I thought... why not Salsa? I need a partner to join the classes Since you are going to be my life partner, why not start now? - NO I'm just asking for a chance to dance not to flirt with you.

Look at my tie. - You were saying this, I thought... Naina has given me this tie With a lovely love letter Love letter, very good. - You...you are something else, man. If it wasn't for you, there would be nothing I know...I know... You are a genius.- Since birth. You are intelligent, brilliant... You should write a book Six days and girl in your face! Even I was thinking along those lines Anyway, whatever I did for you is ok But even you are quite lucky. Because for you, l... What did I do? I didn't do anything... It's all you... It's because of you... your love... You... You are so great! You don't even want to take the credit for it Listen to me for once. Okay. The truth is that it's because of you Naina is in my heart... in my heartbeat... in every breath and in my room... - And in my room! Naina wait, let go of me...- Listen... Let go of me...what? Must have been fun... right? Must have been great fun breaking my heart Six days and girl in your face Both of you should be given an award! Fantastic, Rohit. Listen to me...ya... - No, listen to me. I thought of you as a friend and poured my heart out to you And what did you do? Told him everything! And he... He, who wants to play God to everyone... decided that since he couldn't love me, he would find love for me... and he knocked on your door And told you that your friendship is not just friendship, it's love And you got convinced? Rohit, what kind of a person are you...? who doesn't know his own heart... understand his own feelings? I love you Naina... and that's the truth No! That's not the truth... The truth is that you have broken my heart! You have hurt me... I know that I didn't have laughter in my life before.. didn't have happiness... But at least I had a friend! But today you have taken that away from me... Both of you Just listen, Naina...- No. No! I don't want to hear anything I don't want to understand anything For God's sake, just leave me alone! Just a sec... Naina, I wish I could tell you how much I love you One sec. Wait, I love you very much... And then it says... I love you &... And when I close my eyes I see you When I open my eyes, I long to see you Even when you are not near me, I feel you in everything I'm surrounded by... Every second... every minute... all the time... my eyes search only for my dear Naina Call it love, madness or just my heartbeats... it's the same thing for me A lot of people have loved before... but my love stands apart from all of them because... they don't have you I can never forget you Naina I don't want to forget you You are mine and I will love you forever I will love you till I die... and even after that! All this is written in this diary... Rohit has written all of it How can he hurt...? And you have such a bad handwriting Aman... all this... I didn't... You didn't write... but I said it If you had to write it, you would write the same thing So I said what was in your heart... what's the big deal? Right? And girls like all this... I have done it a lot Are you okay? I just want to make a call. Excuse me! Sorry Mom It's late, let's go I want to say something to you... just listen Naina, to sustain lifelong... every relationship has to have strength along with love Your Papa loved us a lot, but he was a weak man He left us all and went away... didn't even for a moment think what would become of us after him But Rohit... Rohit is not weak... he loves you a lot How easy it is for you to say Papa was weak! And Rohit... taking someone else's help to attain your love... isn't that a sign of weakness? Tell me Mama... To attain his love he sought help... what's wrong with that? Look, I still maintain Rohit is not a weak man He knows you love someone else and yet he is willing to accept you That's strength, my child. That's love. If you reject his love today, it will be a girl's decision... and tomorrow when you repent it, it will be a woman's regret! Hello. Hi Rohit.- Hi Naina. Where are you? In the office Wanted to speak to you Actually it's kind of private. Private & confidential...J. Kapur?... Oh My God! It's Frankie's letter Didi... Guess what? - Now what's happened? Congratulation!

It's Frankie's letter! - Yes... yes What happened? - Naina wants to meet Rohit Finally and they're going for the first meeting. And Frankie's sent a letter - Yes that's fantastic news.

What happened?- Heart attack! Oh, heart attack. Just waiting for Naina and Shiv to settle down... then I can peacefully leave for Chandigarh! And what about Gia? She is not ours!- Dadi. No, no, Gia is as much ours as Naina is And my husband didn't die of a heart attack... he commited suicide Why did you have to tell them the truth? You cannot base new relationships on a lie You couldn't handle old relationships How will you know how to handle new ones? Relationships are not handled. They are maintained But what would you know about them? Now listen my dear daughter-in-law... I will only be your daughter-in-law the day Gia is your grand daughter Gia was not my grand daughter and she will never be! Blood is blood after all! That's it! I don't want to hear anymore! Why? When you are so fond of saying the truth... Iearn to listen to it too. Gai is not my grand daughter She is not a part of this family She is just a burden... a burden which you thrust on this family by adopting her A burden which took away all the happiness in the family... took away peace...took away my son... I hate her... I hate her... I hate that nasty little... NO! We are still paying for my son's mistakes The first mistake he made was marrying you The second was adopting that girl He made a third one too You? Who the hell are you to interfere in our family matters? No one... Just a voice that should have reached you a long time ago A truth that you should have realized long ago Please Jenny, please let me Since you are harping on the truth, I would like to tell you a truth too About your son's illicit relationship... which he hid from all of you But he couldn't hide its result Do you know the name of the result? Aman please.- Jenny, it's alright. The result was Gia... Gia! who could not be accepted by her own mother... but was accepted by your daughter-in-law, Jenny... was brought into this house by your daughter-in-law, Jenny... Jenny... who could have seen the face of the other woman in Gia's face... who could have seen her husband's mistakes in that face... But what she chose to see were those incomplete eyes... and she chose to complete those eyes by filling them with love... your daughter-in-law Jenny Your son would have understood her hurt and her anger... but he couldn't understand her acceptance Jenny's strength reminded him every minute of his own weakness... and it was this feeling that took his life... Not Jenny Dear Jennifer I know in these last six years I have only enquired about Gia... never about you But today, in this last letter I want to thank you.. Thank You Jennifer. Thank You Women are built to forgive the mistakes that their husbands make... but very few women have the courage to accept the mistake... and shower love to such a degree that it doesn't remain a mistake You accepted Gia when l, her mother, couldn't accept her And for this I will always remain indebted to you They say that when a man makes a mistake... he also possesses the ability to pay the price for it But Jennifer, all these years you have paid a price for a mistake... that was not yours in the first place And all that because of me If you can, please forgive me I'm sorry Jennifer. I'm really sorry I caused you a lot of pain! I'm sorry. He was a good man! It was just a mistake! Just a mistake! Yes, my child... Yes... He was a good man! He was a good man, Mother... He was a good man Naina! Just a mistake! And finally Gia's perfect family was complete... complete All the distances were bridged... and we started praying together... Iike one big happy family!
