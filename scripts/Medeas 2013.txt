Forward, hup. Forward, hup. Giddy up. I'm scrubbing dada. Okay, come here. Mama was soaking. Can you pass the salt? Pass your sister the salt. Don't feed the dog. Keep doing that, I'll give it away. Eat your food. Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty. Here I come. Found you! Mama. What's a S-P-I-G... Do insects go to heaven? No. Only people go to heaven. Good people. No one ever knows how bad... If you're in the middle of a doubtful day... It's okay, it's okay. Come down, come on. I wanna see! Michael. You know how it's been. Ain't no food out there for them. Ain't no rain either. Can't do it. I'd like to help you out. You know I would. We've gotta do something about that bill of yours for the past couple months. Well. Been just as tough around here. He has it! Move. It's not it. No. Try moving. Move over a little bit. Wait. Get back, like, this way. Go back. Yes, right there. No, I feel it. If you could take only one, who would you save? Dad or Mom? Mom. Mom has AIDS. You have AIDS, too? No. I dunno... maybe. She's gonna die. When? Soon. That's what happens to people with AIDS. Jacob, come on! Come on. Let's go. Why are you walking so slowly, buddy? And then he landed on the trampoline, jumped over the moon, and landed in a China shoe, then went back home to see his friends, June Bug Head and Hairy Head. ...jumped over the moon, and landed in a China shoe. And then he went back home... To see his friends. To see his friends... what were their names? - June Bug Head and Hairy Head. - June Bug Head and Hairy Head? Are you serious? "I give you Navar the Great, the last of a renowned family of fire eaters whose history goes back way back to Napoleon's days. That preliminary there was just, shall I say, a warm up, because I want you to be prepared to be amazed now with what Navar will do. First, he will consume five cigarettes." Wait, Dad, no, please. Just a little bit longer. Bed, now. Come on. Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight. Where do you think you're going like that? We're not leaving until you wash that off your face. Still don't see it. "Do you know how sweetly he once said to him..." What's going on? What happened? Dad, no. Let's go. Where are you taking him? - Get up. - He didn't do anything. Get in the car. Come on. When are you gonna stop doing that? Instead of doing that, should be doing what you're supposed to. Fill her up. Fifty five. One, perform it on a hill. Two, make sure you have a lot of room, so you don't run into anything. Three, spin around in clockwise circles. Four, yell it while spinning around in circles. It should be rhythmical and fast. Five, if you're trying to get rid of rain, spin in counterclockwise circles and say your chant backwards. It works more effectively in an open field, and it won't work straight away. "From waters of the heavens, to waters of the sea, bring my will upon me, I cast this spell so mote it be. From waters of the heavens, to waters of the sea, bring my will upon me, I cast this spell so mote it be." Rain! Dad. Yeah? Here, let me see that. This is supposed to help. Is it better now? Yeah, much better. Mom. Mom. Mom. Stop it, Dad, stop! Mom, Mom! What did you do? Que bonito es estar hasta arriba  Cuando tienes bastante dinero  Te resultan resto de amigos  Que te dicen que son muy sinceros  Pero el dia que se acaba la plata  Te das cuenta fueron traicioneros  Hay amigos que si son sinceros  Pero existen de todos senores  Son muy pocos los que se te acerquen  Y que tienen buenas intenciones  La amistad de aquellos companeros  Eran flasas por puro dinero  You look like you wanna dance. Hay un dicho que dice la neta  Come on, dance with me. Te visita si estas en la carcel  I don't dance, sorry. Everybody dances. I don't. I'm sorry. So you see I love you so much  That I don't want to watch you leave me, baby  Most of all I just don't  I just don't want to be free, no  I was just, I was just  I was just sittin' here thinkin'  Of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah  When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips now, baby  Yeah yeah  Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah  Baby, baby, I'd rather  I'd rather be blind, boy  Than to see you walk away from me, child  So you see I love you so much  That I don't want to watch you leave me, baby  Most of all, I just don't  I just don't want to be free, no  I was just, I was just  I was just sittin' here thinkin'  Of your kiss and your warm embrace  Look at me. You're my wife. You're my wife. You're my wife. Wanna see something? Do you wanna touch it? It doesn't hurt, look. Dad says it won't even leave a scar. Look at mine. What happened? I was just chasing a cat and, just as I was about to capture it, fell on a bunch of broken bottles. I was a cat in a past life. So I've got a couple lives left. I don't wanna go. You're coming with us, end of story. Let me see it. Put it away. Don't do that. Put it away right now. Now! When I head on out  For an evening  To stretch out my wings and soar  Dad, I gotta pee.
