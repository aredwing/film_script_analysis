I was just 7..and was visiting the bank with my dad. I didn't let go of my dad's hand.. ...nor did his eyes stop haunting mine. After that, every time I visited the bank.. ...I hoped to see him again. But he didn't come. But people had already made up stories about him. ...according to their own convenience. Like.. Like some said he was caught. Or..he became one of the greatest thieves in the world. There's a theory that suggests he suddenly disappeared. And he's been living in some unknown country under an alias. Your earlier films, 'Guns-Part 1' & 'Guns-Part 2'.. ...was the story of a thief. Tell me. Will he be caught in 'Guns-Pan 3'? That's an intelligent question. For that you need to watch the film. So what next? Guns-Pan 4..5..6..7.. I don't know. You seem quite attached to that thief. I've heard so many stories about him. "But there are some yet to be told. Tell me..they say you're quite the ladies-man. I see.. Who are "They". According to the local-media. ...you recently had your 21st break-up. History stands witness, every artist has a process, sir. Don't you think..this is too much. "Less..more..right..wrong." I never keep track. Yes, Meera? Mr. lrani called. Who? Navrose lrani, from Freeway Picture. Oh..him! What's he saying? He's in. He didn't even try to negotiate. He's willing to sign the deal at your price. That's good. He's sent the agreement to our lawyers. Just one problem. He wants to read the script. Now that's a dedicated financer. Wants to read the script. And what did you say? I told him the truth, obviously. Lying is your job, remember. Come on, Meera. What did you say? Don't worry. I didn't tell him that there's no script. I just said you didn't show the script to anyone yet. Did you send those DVD's London to my dad? In the afternoon. - Good. Tonight's the night. Bono. Go and sleep. Hi, dad. You want to have an affair at this age? Not an affair. I want some fun in my boring life. You already had six hean attacks. ...due to your so called "Fun". I am still alive. Exactly. You need a nurse, not a girlfriend. I know, I know. That reminds me, Lisa called to say.. ...that she is quitting from today. Lisa is my nurse. - I know. Jeez.. What did you do this time? Nothing. I just asked for her bra size. Now that's not. - Dad. That's the third nurse that quit this month. I am joking. I need.. ...an inspiration Who's that? Idiot, it means.. Inspiration. Oh..that. Shall I give you? Goodnight, dad. - Bye. Inspiration! Hi.. Hi Kabir. Bye.. - See you. Inspiration! From costumes to DP..everyone's been calling. Even/thing's getting delayed. What do I tell them? Where's the script? Meera..what do you think is a film? A film..is a dream. A dream..where we write stories. We portray characters. We give them dialogues.. ...and then an actor brings those characters and dialogues to life. But..what was that film? It was a dream. And where's the dream? Here..in my mind. It's ready..or getting ready. I just..need to write it down. I know you've seen this face before. But take a good look at it again. Our first encounter with this thief. ...was 2= years ago. In Louvre Museum, Paris Exactly a year later..in the Royal Palace of Qatar. Seven months later.. Petronas Towers, Malaysia. Then lndia..China! Even after 2= years and millions of dollars of theft. ...we still don't know who he is. We're only following a mask. Without any clear information. And whoever he is, he's dangerous. And right now..he's doing a better job than us. He's many steps ahead. Gradually..he's being assumed. ...as one of the greatest thieves in the world. And we.. We're the protectors of the Law..who failed to do their duty. Hello. Hey, Piya. No..dinner won't be possible. I still need to work on the script. Maybe tomorrow" Yeah. You have a good one. What? Greedy dog. As you can see I am standing outside. ...Malaysia's oldest an museum. "Which is now the site of the biggest art robbery in the entire world. The thief walked into the gates of the museum. ...and stole three paintings and walked out in the dead of the night. Three paintings worth over 100 million dollars were stolen. The Malaysian police were informed in the morning.. "But still they have no clues. We'll be following the story, as and when it develops. This is the last painting from a famous French Painter. Bought from an an gallery in London, in 1967. For..25,000 Pounds. Last week an an collector paid me a visit. ...and told me some incredible facts about this painting. He said this painting is incomplete. And someone else has the other side. That art collector wants that painting..the complete one. And he's ready to pay a handsome price for it. How much? 120 million dollars. - For both? For one. Why doesn't he talk to the owner directly? He tried" "but he doesn't want to sell. Roy. It's been a decade since someone called me that. Roy? But that's your name, right? Yes, but no one knows. We humans always want to live someone else's life. That's our nature. And..l am a thief after all. Even my own life..isn't completely mine. Strange, isn't it? Feeling estranged from oneself? You sound too intellectual, Roy. Where's the other half of this painting? Welcome to Malaysia's 'lndo-Malay' Radio channel. The big news of the morning.. ...is that Kabir Grewal.. ...have arrived in Malaysia to shoot Guns-Pan 3. Ayesha Amir, London's film-maker.. ...has been shooting her film here for the past 10 days. Cut it! Cut it! What the hell is this? What is all this? It's rain, sir. This isn't going to stop. You think this will stop today. I mean..why didn't you tell me about the weather report? What do you want me to do? According to the weather report. "The skies were supposed to be clear. Yeah..right! I don't know why we came here. Come on, Kabir. Remember Guns-1 in Afghanistan. You wanted to leave the first day. That was different, and this is different. You know what. Why don't you come over to our hotel for dinner tonight? Meera, this is your third film with me, isn't it? Yes. You know I don't meet my actors outside the character. If they can respect that, then why can't you? I am done. Pack this up. Excuse me. Can you get me a Mikalin with three cubes, please? Three cubes! - Sure, sir. Oh, thank you. Three cubes. Perfect. Excuse me, can you get me one more please? And one of whatever that lady there is having. Thank you. Must be a really interesting book. You never looked up for a moment. I've been standing in this bar for an hour. This is such a happening place. ...and the only thing happening here.. is watching you read. Honestly speaking. I can't drink alone. I feel like I'm an alcoholic. So..please, if you don't mind. I don't mind drinking alone. That's great, thank you. I love a glass of wine with my book. Being alone isn't bad. You find life somewhere entangled in the silence. So that's the secret. ...behind Kabir Grewal's loud, extravagant films. I was going to introduce myself. But how did you know? The newspapers are always flooded with your news. Local press is tired of waiting for you. I really liked meeting you too..Ayesha. It wasn't easy finding out about you. do some hard work. We're all not famous and lucky like you. Oh come on. Don't give fate undue credit for my hard work, please. Actually..according to whatever I heard about you.. ...I shouldn't let you sit here. I see..what did you hear? You're arrogant..rude..etc...! So which was the worst pan? And do you believe everything you hear? No. - That's good. But I was wondering are you really what the people think you are? Or you try to be what the people say about you. I've to get up early tomorrow. Thanks for the wine. Good evening Ms. Ayesha Amir. - Good evening. Mr. Kabir Grewal has sent this book for you. Have a pleasant evening. Yeah..Kabir. I need a girl in this film..who will stay in that mansion. What mansion? What girl? She will have the painting which Roy wants to steal. Kabir..l don't understand. I haven't read the script yet. I haven't seen it either but you will understand. And by the way, I had a word with the casting agency. She is the perfect cast. Arrange for her tickets, okay. You know what..this film is completely on you. If anything goes wrong..it's on you. Yeah.. 110,000 dollars to no.82.. sold. Thank you. Now the next work is by young, and upcoming. ...Spanish artist by the name of Edward Ramon. He's causing a bit of stir in the an world.. With his emotionally. encycle pieces. May I introduce..La Bella! I am opening the bids at 25,000 dollars. 25.. No. 23, thank you. 25,000 dollars. Do I hear 30? Anyone, No.93.. 30,000 dollars.

Going twice. Sold. Gentlemen in the back..no.46. Thank you very much. Our next piece, ladies and gentlemen is a very fine piece. Okay, cut it. Doesn't she look a bit like Ayesha Amir? Who? That was rude! You know I didn't write that book. Still..that was rude. What? Now I get it? You do relate to some of the things in that book. And it's raised a few questions to which you don't have answers. Now you're furious at me, because I sent you that book. Right? Yeah.. What do you want to say? What do you want to hear? Actually. I have an early shoot tomorrow. Got to go. Goodnight. Cut it. Cut! Looks good, huh! - Very good. Nice work. Shall we move on? - Yes. Prepare for the next shot, I'll join you. 0K8'!- Ayesha..hi. I was just shooting close-by, and saw you pass-by. How's your shooting coming along? It's alright. Don't you have a shoot? I was working on the script. Aah.. Me too. Never-ending process. Kabir GrewaFs films have a script too? Of course not. I don't have a script. People just come to watch my film. And my film makes millions. I am not like one of those film-makers who.. ...hugs trees, does..Yoga! Makes films for himself..and watches others films. Are you one of them? Those types really scare me. Okay, that was bad. I am sorry. I know you don't like my sense of humor at all. Definitely not my wine. And neither my book. But the coffee here is really nice. 0K8'!- Yeah? Come on.. Don't you believe that. ...sometimes the location gives the film-maker his story? You know, just like lndia.. "The British ruled Malaysia for many years. They got their independence 10 years after us. In 1957. But if you look into the eyes of any local.. You can see that the battle is over.. ...but the destruction is still following him. If you see closely, you will also see hope. I see.. Is that why you came here? Actually I was heading somewhere else but, ended up here. Maybe this is just a coincidence, or something else. But this place is perfect. - it is. There couldn't be a better place for my film. That's good. Do you believe in coincidences? Are you one of those people, who believes. ...that there is a reason for every small event in our life. Coincidence. Coincidence is nothing. There is a reason for everything. Madam, package for you. Put it in the car. So first you outbid me on a painting. And then you gift it to me. You could've let me buy it. Then I wouldn't have met you. There are other ways to meet. Yes..but this is my way. I don't know whether it's right or wrong. But at least we met. Aren't you a bit crazy? People have called me crazy before. This isn't the first time. You have an answer to all the questions. Right now..only your questions. I can't take this. Why? I don't even know your name. Sometimes..it's not necessary. So I am flattered, truly I am. Give it some time" You might change your mind. Hi. Can you tell me which room is Kabir Grewal in? Sure, let me check for you. Mr. Grewal is actually in our royal villa. Just give me a moment, I'll get a buggy for you. - Sure. Buggy! Buggy! Hello. Need a ride? What do you think? I've been waiting for a buggy for over an hour. And you're taking a tour of this jungle. What happened? Break-up. Too much to drink. I don't know. Maybe she's dead. That's not funny. Good news. She's still alive. Shall we? Idiot. You know I was thinking. ...you were telling me about that coincident. I was thinking let's discuss is it over dinner tomorrow at 8. You are unbelievable. You are just like how people describe you. Rude, Obnoxious, Arrogant. You know how it is with these boys. You like that. You still didn't tell me what you're doing here? I did. I am a tourist. I've seen many tourists. You're not one. There are some things here.. "Which I buy cheap and sell for a higher price. When you say that it sounds like you're here to rob us. It is stealing from one point of view. We're all thieves. You're very strange. You know that. Tell me something more about yourself. Something unique. I want to disappear. Meaning? Someday I'll leave all this and go far away. To some unknown city of an unknown country. And star-t a new life under an alias. Don't forget to ask me before you leave. Will you come? You won't ask. What are you doing here alone? Just thinking. Ayesha Amir. Huh? No. She's an amazing girl, but not your type. Really? I see. You have a type, Kabir. Actually, it's quite simple. Pick up any fashion magazine.. ...and you will find your type of girl. But Ayesha is different. She doesn't fit in your films..nor in your life. Thank you. Don't you think you're being too dramatic? Yeah..okay. Yeah..Maybe! Cut! Oh..champagne..nice. Does Rohan know about this? Oh my, God! Kabir Grewal! Right? I am going to call him. Kabir. I just want to have dinner with you. Not marry you. Thanks for the champagne. You are most welcome. Then meet in lobby at 8 o'clock What? Nothing. "Get me those golden earrings." "SweetheamPll dangle them on my ears." "Get me those golden earrings." "SweetheamPll dangle them on my ears." "Get me those golden earrings." "SweetheamPll dangle them on my ears." "Get me those golden earrings." "SweetheamPll dangle them on my ears." "Get me those golden earrings." "SweetheamPll dangle them on my ears." "Say yes..and take me shopping." "Say yes..and take me to a romantic film." "I have sent requests." "My fair arms.." "O Baby..my fair arms." "My fair arms.." "O Baby..my white arms." "My fair arms.." "O Baby..they are for you." "My fair arms.." "O Baby..my fair arms." Geoffrey.. It's Kabir. Yeah, from last night. How are you? Okay, I need a table for two tonight. 8 o'clock. Okay. The best champagne. No, no, no..not the same.. Hey What are you doing here? I missed my flight. - You missed your flight? Wonderful. "I feel overwhelmed." "And I am soaring in the sky.." "And I am soaring in the sky all night." "My life's completely changed." "..and I've lost my slumber." "And I am soaring in the sky.." "And I am soaring in the sky all night." "Say yes..and buy me a pink veil." "Say yes..and buy me colorful bangles." "I have sent requests." "My fair arms.." "O Baby..my fair arms." "My fair arms.." "O Baby..my white arms." "My fair arms.." "O Baby..they are for you." "My fair arms.." "O Baby..my fair arms." Good evening, MsAmir. I am the hotel manager. Your car's waiting for you. My Car? Your car. Where's Kabir? Mr. Grewal is at the venue, but he's sent a car for you. Shall we? Hey..there you are. Hello. - Hi. You look great. - Thanks. Shall we? I was so confused. Why two cars? Oh..that. Just you know..safety. If you want to go..or we..or her? Who? Pia's inside. Pia? Last night's casualty. Can you believe it, she missed her flight? I mean unbelievable. No.22.. Yeah whatever. But you know what, Ayesha. I totally understand if you don't want to go inside. It's not your fault or mine. It's completely her fault, and she should pay for it. Right? So..if you're feeling uncomfortable at all. And I think..you are feeling a bit uncomfortable. So all you got to do, is go inside and tell her that. We're going someplace else, that's it. And the other car can drop her home. What do you think? Me? Yeah. What do I think? Just tell me..are we going in or someplace else? That's it. Okay..let's go someplace else. Okay, cool. So I should tell her. Yeah. 0K8'!- Give me a minute. Idiot! Yes? Send him in. Did you make these? Huh! They say a good picture is one that can narrate an entire story. And a good story can be captured in a picture. After looking at these, I feel like I don't know you at all. Stop, you're embarrassing me. I'll change and come. I can't say where he is or what he is going to do. But owing to years of investigation. ...and the evidence that we gathered in the past 10 days. ...I can see that we're very close to him. Have you ever heard cops and robber stories? No matter what the thief does. "But he always gets caught in the end. This story is about to end now. Hello. - Detective Wadia. Speaking. Nice interview. And you are? But you made a mistake. You've been chasing me for 3 = years.. ...and you haven't even read the first chapter yet. This story will end, detective. It definitely will. But not the way..you claimed it will. Okay, cut it. That's good. Guys, give me a nice big wide-shot. Kabir..we've been working overtime for three days. The crew's tired. How about we take a break tomorrow? 0K8'!- Thanks. I hate night shoots. Wow! Good morning. You're up early? Yeah.. I was about to hit the bed when I got a little distracted. 80.. Yoga..huh? Yeah.. Yoga. You should try it sometime. Me? I am fine. Hello. I am not sick either. Yeah.. Sorry for not calling you after that day. I thought. - Oh..forget about it. Disaster. .huh? If I could, I would've reshot that entire scene again. No time for that. I'm leaving in three days. What? You're done. Yeah.. WOW! Three days, huh! Make it four. Why? There's an island close-by. Just two hours away. If we leave in the morning we'll be back by evening. 0K8'!- No..no.. You live alone in this huge estate all by yourself. Aren't you scared? Not scared. I do feel lonely. But not scared. Don't you feel lonely? I do.. But I am used to living alone now. Me too. You're strange. Just like you. You were saying something. - What? About some island. Yes. "Selfish. ." "Be a little selfish." "Stop listening to the world." "Listen only to yourself." "Selfish. ." "Be a little selfish." "Stop listening to the world." "Listen only to yourself." "if something goes wrong.." "Even if the head's lost for a while." "Let those careless heartbeats." "..make a sound loud enough for everyone to hear." "The sun has just set." "Take a sip of fun." "And forget your way back home." "The sun has just set." "Take a sip of fun." "Forget all the grief in the world." "Ask me for anything." "I can give you anything." "..forget your way back home." "Ask me for anything." "I can give you anything." "..forget all the grief in the world." "Let's not care about anyone." "That's what this moment is teaching us now." "Let's not care about anyone." "That's what this moment is teaching us now." "With this selfish desire.." "..let's live freely." "It's a romantic ambiance." "The sun has just set." "Take a sip of fun." "And forget your way back home." "The sun has just set." "Take a sip of fun." "And forget all the grief in the world." "Let's soar in the skies right now." "With no clue where to go." "Let's soar in the skies right now." "With no clue where to go." "Because all the paths..lead to the destination." "Let's distance ourselves..from the world." "And some distance between us." "The sun has just set." "Take a sip of fun." "And forget your way back home." "The sun has just set." "Take a sip of fun." "And forget all the grief in the world." "Ask me for anything." "I can give you anything." "Ask me for anything." "I can give you anything." Actually, you know something. The one holding the gun is always in control. Because everyone listens to him. That's true. That's not true. - It is. Yeah..if you're speaking in terms of hean then, I won't argue. Why not? Because the hean can't be trusted. It slips anytime. At least to shoot a bullet one needs to pull the trigger. I have a rule too. - Really? If the story is heading in the wrong direction. "Then, you should end it right there. No point in taking it any further. And what do you mean by that? You know what I mean. I wish I could take this serenity along with me. You can find this serenity in any corner of the world. Things we don't understand, we don't hear. And after you leave tomorrow" "this place will be calmer then it needs to be, Ayesha Amir. I don't know why, but. I will miss you. I always wanted to be a belly dancer. I couldn't do that. I would be afraid to come on the stage. Stay here. Who are you? Be honest. Because you never give an honest answer. I told you.. You like to keep that mystery about yourself, don't you? I guess you're hiding yourself. From who? You will have to tell me that. You're making me confess before I commit the crime. Thanks for today. What I did? I read your script. What? Really? WOW! How was it? I only got to the part where Roy steals the painting from Tia. I only wrote it so far. What about Tia now? The story is about Roy, not Tia. What if Tia is in love with Roy? That won't happen.. "But if she does, it's okay. She will have to get over him. And what about Roy? Roy.. Roy is a thief in this story. He's gone for now. Now he'll have a new job..new name. Do you know what they say about writers? Read their story, and you'll know how they are. Are you judging me, Ayesha? Don't do it..it's just a story. Stories can never be wrong, Kabir. Is this your car, sir? - Yeah. Sorry, there's no parking here. Just five minutes. - I am sorry, sir. You must park inside. Just five minutes. - Sorry, sir. I'll be right back. Director of Guns Pan-1&2, Kabir Grewal.. ...who's often been in the headlines regarding his love-life..

As soon as the police checking reduces.. ...I will come. Hello. No, I didn't read the article. And don't call my number again, understand. Hey, Sam? How much longer for the shot. Just 10 minutes, Kabir. You've been saying that for the last one hour. We're shooting here, not out on a picnic. Meera, we'll have to cancel shoot today. I don't feel too well. Meera, since the last five days there has been no shooting. This is not done. Where is Kabir? Pick up goddamit! So what did you do this time? Nothing. Then why did she leave? She just left without saying a word. She just left. - Just like that. Yes, just like that. Is this the new trend? What trend? How are you? Are you fine? Yes, why? You're not upset, or yelling at me. You sound delusional. Are you okay? Dad, please. Why do you always judge me? I am not judging you, I am just asking. And so what if I judge you, you're my son. Kabir! Open the door! Kabir! Open the door! Hello. Dad. I'll call you back. Kabir! I said open the door! Kabir, enough is enough! Open the door! Everyone's waiting for you! I knew that after she left there will be a strange tranquility. But this was different. It grew with time" ...and I was completely sinking in it. Like I've been locked in some room. And it has no doors. When I came here, I didn't have a story. When I found her, I found my story. Every moment I spent with her star-ted weaving the pages of my story. She left suddenly. Didn't say anything, just left. My story came to a halt. I don't know what happens next. Roy's story is your story. Every question is your question. And you know the every answer. If you don't know what happens next. "Then no one does. Good evening Mumbai. It is 10.40 at night. The temperature is 32 degrees Celsius. To know the state of Mumbai traffic, call on 462323. And now the news of the Entertainment world. Kabir Grewal who had gone to Malaysia two months back.. ...to shoot his fllm 'Guns-3'.. ...will return to Mumbai tonight. We have just got the news. ...that Kabir Grewal had kept his unit there for one month. "But however there was no shooting taking place. During this time there was news about his affair with Ayesha Amir. There is more spicy news from the Entertainment world. ...till then wait for a short while. Look who's here.. Hi! How are you? You're not giving me too many options, Mr. Grewal. We've already suffered a big loss. Do you know how much money I've invested in your film? You're right, Mr. lrani. You have indeed suffered a loss.. ...and it is completely my fault. Let's do one thing, you can take your money back from me. Kabir? - Yeah. Do you know what you're saying? You'll be out on the streets, Kabir. I know. Fine..I'll talk to my lawyers. Hi, dad. Do you have any dinner plans? No. No plans for dinner. - Fine, I am coming. What? Here? Hello..dad? Hey What are you doing? The doctors advised you against it. I was celebrating. Celebrating? For what? You know what's been going on in my life these days. I know.. What you're feeling right now.. ...and not letting you work.. ...is called a 'hean-break'. Actually, it's called a 'Writer's block'. That thing you're saying, doesn't happen with me. It happens with everyone. Okay..so now you're generalizing it. No, I'm not but. Remember, when you were just a kid. All you kids together went for a treasure hunt. And the boy that won the treasure hunt.. "Got a toy-gun as a reward. You didn't talk to anyone for a week. You were adamant that you wanted that gun. You didn't admit it back then" ...nor will you admit it now, that you were heart-broken. I think that was a kid's obstinacy, but. Not bad, dad..you remember. I am your father, my son. Cheer up. So this time..you're really head-broken. So are we're celebrating that? Look, you didn't complete your studies. Consider this as your graduation. And as they say all that is not in need is a broken hean. Your graduation gift. Oh..gift. A watch..which I don't wear. Wear it.. You'll know the value of time. It's really sweet of you, dad, but really.. no thanks. Fine, I'll keep it. 80.. ...how is she? Who? Come on, you know who I am talking about. Ayesha. She's crazy, just like me. Unique. That was probably the most beautiful evening of my life. Everything was perfect. But everything changed with dawn. He was in front of me, but I was alone. All I remember is that I was scared of him. Hello. Mr. lrani, I am with Kabir. At Ahuja Towers. I'll be at the office in 30 minutes. Yeah..I'll see you. Okay, bye. You didn't have to do this, Kabir. You're wrong. At least I won't have to tolerate that lrani anymore. You know I am proud of you. Finally.. Finally..really? That's really sweet of you. I always thought..you will never be able.. ...to stand up to the real struggle in life. It's really good to know.. ...that you have such high thoughts about me. That's done. And better leave before I star-t to cry. I have lots to do. Bye. I love it. Try to fix those together. - Okay. Very nice. Yes just skip. Didn't you see the "Do Not Disturb" signboard? Open the door, Kabir. - Wait. Eastern Oriental International Film Festival Jury. You want to go? They invite me every year, but I never go. Why now? Have a look. Just have a look. Hey bono. Ladies and Gentlemen, the next section is.. The award for the best foreign language film goes to.. Ayesha Amir, Malacca Diaries. WOW! Thank you. Congratulations. WOW! Someone once said to me that sometimes a place gives you a story. Thank you, Malaysia for being that beautiful place. That beautiful story, that became my Malacca Diaries. And you've made me the happiest person alive today. And for that I'm forever grateful. Thank you so much. Did you get this award because your ex-boyfriend is on the jury? Do you think you won this award because of Kabir Grewal? 'There were all kinds of faces and mask around me.' 'Young, old, male, female. And everyone was happy. I wonder what they were happy about. Or what grief were they hiding. Happiness is very addictive like alcohol. I was feeling happy too.. ...that maybe a new chapter of my life was about to begin. Kabir. Hi. I thought you won't come. Maybe that would've been right. Ayesha.. - Wait. I had many questions about you. And not a single answer. But when I thought about those questions, I realized.. ...that no matter what you say..it's going to be wrong. . I knew one Kabir Grewal.. ...and there's another one, whom I don't want to know. Who are you? Are you Kabir or Roy? Do you know that? You plundered my life and made your story. You stole it from me, just like Roy. We're very different people, Kabir. I wanted a simple story. But time made me realize.. ...that we were both living in two different stories at the same time. Let's forget..what happened between us. There's no point in taking that story any further. If you know everything, then.. ...why did you come here? To tell you to stay away from my life. There's no place for you in it. "Are you a stranger..or a kin?" "What do I say..or not say." "Are you a stranger..or a kin?" "What do I say..or not say." "The gestures are silent..and I am at loss of words." "I feel lost, and my arms are lonely." "Beloved.. O Beloved." "You still dwell in this separation, beloved." "Beloved.. O Beloved." "You still dwell in this separation, beloved." "Even though we're apartbut you're still with me." "Somethings definitely attached to me." "Even though I am shattered.. I still didn't break apart." "You still exist somewhere in my life." "The gestures are silent..and I am at loss of words." "I feel lost, and my arms are lonely." "Beloved.. O Beloved." "You still dwell in this separation, beloved." "Beloved.. O Beloved." "You still dwell in this separation, beloved." "Every moment..l feel the desire.." "..which was never satiated." "Life is still going on.." "But this isn't life." "The gestures are silent..and I am at loss of words." "I feel lost, and my arms are lonely." "Beloved.. O Beloved." "You still dwell in this separation, beloved." "Beloved.. O Beloved." "You still dwell in this separation, beloved." You also come. But be careful.. Roy Wadia is still here. Hi. Sit. How are you? 0K8'!- What's wrong, Roy? Roy! Where are you lost? I never cared about what the society deemed right or wrong. Only listened to myself.. ...and followed my own rule book. I am a thief..and this is my job. I star-ted working with you.. "Because, I wanted to run away from my life. I wanted to leave everything behind. I had many questions in my mind.. ...and this seemed to be the right answer. And you gave me a new name, new identity. ...and a chance to get away from myself. But in the past few days. "After spending some time with myself.. ...in the middle of the sea, I was haunted by the same questions again. And I realized that..questions remain the same. ...only the answers change. Hi, Doc. What? Yeah, I am coming. Hi, Meera. I'm okay. I've said my goodbyes, Meera. Now let's complete the movie. Vikram, his name's Abra Rizvi. And he's the same person.. ...who's connected to many painting thefts. Whoever has done the robbery.. ...he is the one who has bought it. And I know..he's now in Malaysia. 0K8'!- Take the Malaysia police' help and find him. If we find him, we'll find our thief. Got it? 3 pm? That sounds good. Yeah. I'll be there. That sounds perfect, Mr. Garcia. I know the place. You are here? I want those paintings back. What do you mean? I'll pay you whatever that art collector's paying you. Come, sit. - No, I am fine. Roy. Sit. You never speak without a reason. So I won't ask why you want those paintings back. The fact is..that art collector's already paid me. I've been in this business for 40 years. If I've given my word, I have to stick to it. Listen. My job is to deliver those paintings. After that you can do as you please. Right? Hello. Detective Wadia. You've been missing for so long. Where are you? We're both in Malaysia, Detective. This story is over. Tomorrow I will disappear forever, but before I leave.. I want to return something that belongs to you. Me? What is that? Hello. Do you play chess? I was wondering.. ...what the next move should be. I don't want to waste your time. Shall we get to the point? I never heard your name before? Who I am is irrelevant. You know what I want. You know..l am not ready to sell them at any cost. So..why did you come here? To tell you.. ...if you don't change your mind.. "Then I'll have to steal those paintings from you. Seems like you're looking for someone? Two days ago..l lost someone here. Who? He's just a thief. Has he stolen from you? No, this is my job. He's a thief and I am the police. I was this close to him. But I couldn't see his face. Finally 'Guns-Pan 3'. What should be the audience's expectations with this film? The thief's story ends with this story. So is this the end of the trilogy? If his story ends, then I guess so. How was your shooting experience? It was one of the most memorable experience of my life. And was Ayesha Amir also responsible. ...for making it a memorable experience. Not at all. Your personal life is not making the headlines these days. What's the secret behind the new Kabir Grewal version 2.0? Someone told me that. ...read the story, and you'll know how they are. Does that make sense to you. People often say "Now I will change my life completely." But they never do it. But my opportunity is here. But..no matter how much time changes. ...we still have to pay for our past. Whether in this world, or the next. "But we'll definitely meet again. I know. "Bring me closer to myself." "I want to see..whether you dwell in me or not." "Ask my every breath." "Whether you dwell in the infinity or not?" "Bring me closer to myself." "I want to see..whether you dwell in me or not." "Ask my every breath." "Whether you dwell in the infinity or not? "I am near you.. and near me." "Are you there or no?" "Are you there or no?" "Are you there or no?" "Are you there or no?" "You're the path my dreams tread on." "You're the one that connects my dreams with reality." "You're a beautiful moment in my lifetime." "You're the moment that never stays..of my future" "I am near you.. and near me." "Are you there or no?" "Are you there or no?" "Are you there or no?" "Are you there or no?" "You're the reason for the smile on my lips." "Without you my existence has no meaning." "Without your light..l seem faded away." "Fill me with life so I can stay alive." "I am near you.. and near me." "Are you there or no?" "Are you there or no?" "Are you there or no?" "Are you there or no?" WOW! I don't know what amazes me more. Seeing you ready before time, or..watching you play the piano? Actually, I always wanted to learn to play it.. "But I could never spare the time. Why? I have the number of the piano teacher? Do you want it? Stop it. You look happy. You should be too. Come on. Today is your film's success party. Finally..it's over. I don't know, Meera. How I made this film? The story is about someone else, and it's got my name. No. This is your film, Kabir. And honestly speaking. ...this film is more about you, compared to the rest. Thank you. We've done three films together. And you didn't leave me. Actually. ...you're the first one that lasted this long. You didn't give others a chance. You just kept moving ahead, leaving others behind. Maybe I've come too far now.. ...and there's no one around now. Sometimes I think" ...did I leave them or did they all leave me. Hey..what's wrong? Nothing. First time in my life.. ...I'm feeling lonely. Dad's no more. There was so much I wanted to tell him. And the one I want to talk to.. "Doesn't want to listen. And when I think about everything. ...I think I deserve it all. No.. No you don't. You. You've changed, Kabir. And maybe.. ...now you know the importance. "Which you didn't earlier. Are you flirting with me? You wish.. Come on..lrani must be waiting for me. Oh, G0d.. When will lrani's drama ever come to an end. Let's go. I thought maybe this was the biggest mistake of my life. Maybe this is the film which will make me bankrupt. But thank you, Kabir. Thank you. We've got the biggest opening of the year. Cheers. Cheers. What are you doing here? Are you following me? I never imagined this story would end like this. Me neither. Now I know, life can never be contained. ...in small boxes like in comic books. N ow? What next? I don't know. Look.. ...our questions were similar, and so were the answers. Out story star-ted in the same way. And it will end in the same way. Must be a really interesting book. Hi. So..you're off to Hong Kong? How do you know? The newspapers are flooded with your pictures these days. What are you doing here, Kabir? I am here to see you, Ayesha. Last and final call for passenger Ms. Ayesha Amir travelling on British airways flight no. BA 232 to Hong Kong. Please reach immediately. That's my flight. I have to go. Kabir...! You have many questions, don't you? I have the answers. So, if you stop running, then maybe.. ...I can give you your answers. Nothing is a coincidence, Ayesha. Not even our meeting. When you came in my life.. ...you became a pan of my story. And you gave me a story. "Which brought me closer to myself. All I know is.. ...I don't want to lose you, Ayesha. And if you still want to go away, then" I saw your film. And, how was it? British airway flight no. BA 232 to Hong Kong is now ready to depart Roy. I thought you would never ask. I thought you won't come. "You fell in me drop by drop." "And you were more in me than myself." "I felt your wet body." "Come, I wish I could drink you." "There is ego left in me." "Look, there is no ego in you too." "I am getting burnt with hot breaths." "You are melting in me." "I burn slowly." "I meet with your shyness." "I will melt your wax body." "Even my twists and turns are fed up when you are with me." "I will burn every pan of you." "I felt your wet body." "Come, I wish I could drink you." "Let's make some mistakes." "This exploring fingers." "Let them feel your body." "Are you a hot moment or a boiling ice." "Come waste yourself on me." "I felt your wet body." "Come, I wish I could drink you." "There is ego left in me." "Look, there is no ego in you too." "I am getting burnt with hot breaths." "You are melting in me."
