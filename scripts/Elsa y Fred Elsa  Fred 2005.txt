We'll take it off ourselves. - What? Us? - Well, you. - You have a tool box? - Yes. Then go get it, I'll help you. Come on! - Get me my tools! - Why are you yelling? This woman is driving me crazy! Good morning, Ma'am. Got off on the wrong foot with the new neighbor? She's not my neighbor. Her father's the one that's moving in. Yes, it seems he's a widower. Poor man. Though, if the deceased was like the daughter... - Here! Take your box. - Good luck with the pliers. Thank you, Ma'am. You see? It wasn't that hard! - Well, we've... - I haven't got all day! In the bedroom. Careful! It was my mother's! - Mom! - Where's your father? - No, Mom... - Give me the car keys. Did you lock it? Take this to the room. - But, Mom... - Come on! Come on! Idiot! Some nerve. Why does he have a cell phone? He never turns it on! I can't believe it! This woman is taking me to my grave. Alfredo, let's go. Is it better here or on the coffee table? I don't know. Ask grandpa. It's his house. Hey! Hey! The chairs! Take them to the kitchen! Don't just leave them there! Finally! Where the hell have you been?! And why is your cell phone off?! Cuca, what have you done to the car? I leave it one hour with you and you crash it. Are you crazy? I didn't crash the car! You didn't? Well, the two front lights are shattered. Are you deaf?! I didn't crash the car! It was an old lady in a dark red car. - Why didn't you tell me? - You didn't let me! You see?! You never think what you say! Cuca! I told you to leave it in a parking lot! Oh, sure! Let Cuca do everything! I'm always doing everything anyway! Oh, really?! Who'll fix my car?! My car is ruined! What do you think of the apartment? It's fine. Fine. I'm on my way. You should've been at the clinic 15min ago! - I got held back. - What were you doing?! I'm not going to explain. Just wait for me there. That's why I'm calling, Mom. I can't be there. My office called for an emergency meeting. - I'll stop by your house later. - Is not necessary! Yes! Yes it is, Mom! I have to ask you some questions. Okay, I've got to go. I'm driving. Bye. A controller like his father. The fridge and microwave are plugged in. I took a walk around the block and there are many restaurants. Even so, I left you some chicken soup. - It's in the microwave. - Okay, all set. Let's go, Cuca. Come on! Your dad needs to rest! I'm coming! Here! Take it! Javier, leave that dog alone and say goodbye to grandpa! The super is called Goyo. I talked to him. He'll help you out if you need anything. Bye, Grandpa! In any case, call us if anything happens. Let's go, Cuca! He'll be fine! Bye, Dad. Call me whenever you like. Hey, did you give Juan your new phone number? I'll call him tomorrow. - I can call him if you want. - No, I'll call him. Call him. It'll be good for you to go out with him. - Sweetie! - Cuca! - Oh, I'm sorry. - That's okay. - Good evening. - Good evening. Come on, come on! Let's go! What questions do you have to ask. Come on, Mom. We'll talk inside. - Mom! - I'm coming! What's wrong with you? It's her. The woman who crashed the car. Now, let's talk, Mom. I got the bank statement and there's a withdrawal. What did you spend that money on, Mom? - My living expenses! - Mom! It was 1,400 Euros! What are you implying? That you want the card back?! No! I'll give it back and pay every cent I spent! Mom! Please, I'm not asking that! I'm just asking how you spent that money! Oh, but... Let's get down to business. Are you staying for dinner? It's a simple question! I warn you... ...there isn't food in the house. - Mom! - Don't worry! We can order in. Mom! Stop avoiding the question! Answer me! - Answer what?! - About the money! You're helping Alejo out again! Alejo? Nonsense! Just a second. Someone's at the door. Saved by the bell. Ma'am, what you've done... ...is a complete lack of respect and education! I'm going to inform the authorities! Not only for damaging my property... ...but also for threatening the life of a minor! It's the first time I've ever seen this child. Stop threatening my son! Ma'am, calm down. What happened, Mom? I don't know. She's crazy. No, Ma'am, I'm not crazy. This afternoon... Is she your mother? - Yes. - No! Mom. Yes. Go on. Your mother crashed into our car... ...and ran away! My son saw everything! - Don't you have a dark red car? - No! - Mom! - It's crimson. I warn you, I'm not moving... ...until you account for the damages! - Calm down. - I want the insurance info! Mom, go get your insurance number. - No, I can't. - What?! I didn't pay the last bill. Well... You are completely irresponsible! You can't drive without insurance! - What if she killed someone?! - I didn't kill anyone! - And that headlight... - Both headlights, Ma'am! - Okay, two headlights... - Calm down, please! Ma'am, I'll take care of everything. Ask for a budget and call me when you have it. I'll send you the money. Some people should have their license revoked. There are some who should not have gotten it at all. That woman's insane. What a scandal over a little headlight. - Mom? - What? Tomorrow, when this lady calls... ...you fill out the check with the amount... ...and give it to her. - No. You heard me, Mom. - Yes, but I can't. - Why?! Because I can't. I don't know where she lives! Isn't she your neighbor? No, she isn't. Her father lives here. He moved into an apartment in the hall. Then take it to the father. Mom, pay attention, please. Here's the check. Don't lose it! Okay. You don't trust me? - Your own mother? - Are you serious, Mom? Yes, seriously. Go on! I have no energy or will. I'm too tired. Come on, Alfredo. Get out, man! Itll do you good to move your bones. What can you do locked up all day? You're punishing yourself. - Cuca called you, didn't she? - No! Yes. She did call you. Don't lie to me. Okay, she did, but don't change the subject. I'll pick you up tomorrow at nine. No, Juan. Really. You have to go back to your normal life. My life will never be normal anymore. I'm trying to help you. And I'm grateful... ...but if you want to go on being my friend... ...don't push me. I have my daughter for that. As you wish. Today could be a day impossible to get back. Don't let this wondrous day get away. Everything that's here was placed for you. Don't look at it through the window come and sit at the feast. Fight for what you have... Well, that man is as ordinary as his daughter... ...or he's as blind as a bat. Hey, boy! Come here. Come here. Come here with me. - Javi! - I called Don Juan... ...and he says you didn't want to go out with him. Since when do you talk to Juan? Since grandma died. Come on, go change. No, I'm not going. I'm on holiday, I got up early... ...and I came all the way here. Come on, Grandpa. Cheer up. Hello? Mom, it's the third time I call! - Why didn't you answer?! - I knew it was you. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm peachy. Mom, your neighbor's daughter called. She gave me the budget to fix the car. Write this down, Mom. It's 1,470 Euros. She's a thief! You can't take this! I will talk her into lowering that price! Please, don't do anything more! Give her the check and let's get this over with. - She's stealing! - On another note. It's Carla's birthday on the twenty-fourth. I'm telling you now so you can't say later... When have I ever missed your kid's birthday party? - Last year. - I was in Seville. Take note. I'll pick you up on the 24th. Bye. She was in Seville. She says she was in Seville! Oh, God! I can't look at you like this! Think, okay?! Remember, you got Juanjo's job! Remember that nice woman owner of a gallery... ...who told you the job was yours? - Yes, I went. - That's good news! - Great! - I went to close... ...the deal and she gave me the price. It's too much. No! Yes, the place is great if you can afford it. - How much? - A lot. I can't pay it alone. I need three of four more. Oh, no! - To pay that scandalous price? - No! No! I have to do it on my own. A place like this? It's really nice, they have canaps. I understand perfectly what you're trying to say! I think it's time you talked to him! - I already did. - And? - Just as expensive. - No! Money, money. - It can't be that much. - 1,200 Euros. That's what the night manager told me. Now I have to talk to the other one today... ...I know that one better. It's the police. Hello? Mom? Did you give him the check? - No, not yet. He wasn't home. - Mom! Try again! How can I if he's not there? - Where are you? - Where am I? The Prado Museum chatting with girls. - Mom! - I didn't tell you. There's a strange man following me. - What are you saying? - His face doesn't say much. He's strange. I'll call you later. Can you believe that? He chases me! He controls me! - Well... - Well... - Shall I ask for the check? - Yes. - Are you paying? - You've got nothing on you? - No. - Nothing at all? Not even a Euro? Don't worry, I'll pay. Thank you. We'll be in touch. - Thank you. - Goodbye. It's nice and well positioned. I don't know. There are others across the street and next door. It's across and next door, it isn't this one. It's a good idea. Sorry, it's an idea everyone has had. The city is full of cybercafs, Paco. You have to have ideas before others have them. The same happened with the studio and video club. You're egging me on, Cuca. You're a specialist. Hugo and his cousin are thrilled with the idea! They loved the place. They're waiting for us to give some sign. We don't only have to decide, Paco! We need the money! Haven't you spoken to your father? No, not yet. I told you to do it when the apartment was sold. He had fresh money then! I told you to do it when he bought the new flat! He has at least You're a vulture. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Bonaparte, quiet. Bonaparte. I won't take up much of your time. I'm Elsa. Elsa Oviedo. I'm your neighbor in J. J as in Josphine. I thought Josphine and Napoleon... ...and Bonaparte. - Alfredo Ponce Cabeza de Vaca. Huh? Oh! Some last name. How may I help you, Ma'am? I'm sorry, call me Elsa. I need to give you this check. What's that check for? What? Your daughter didn't tell you? Oh, it's the car payment. One moment. Excuse me? Two headlights can't be that expensive! Even if they're imported! It can't be! What are you implying, Ma'am? I'm not implying, I'm saying... ...that when I see this... With 1,470 Euros... ...I could feed my five grandchildren a month! Not even a month! Two months! They're five children. They lost their mother. Their father's a widower that doesn't work... ...and now this. - Your daughter passed away? Yes. No, thankfully not my daughter... ...my daughter-in-law. She was a lovely girl. The family was wrecked. I help... ...but with my pension and my other son's help... ...it's very little. And the youngest one is sick. He has a strange disease. It's a rare virus. Just what we needed, another disgrace. Anyway... I'm really sorry. I'm sorry too, believe me. Is that your wife in the picture? Yes. Are you a widower, by any chance? I'm a widow. How about you? Seven months. Oh, seven months is very recent. The first year isn't easy, believe me. Well, then... Well... - Good day. - Good day, Ma'am. Cold bastard. - Elsa. - What did I forget? This. If you need the money... No, I can't accept this. Your daughter was short with me. Don't listen to Cuca. She is... ...very temperamental, but she's a good girl. - Cuca? - Yes, her name is Alicia... ...but we call her Cuca. No, I can't. Take it. Keep it and you can pay me back when you can. I'll give my daughter the money so she'll give it a break. What's really important now are the grandchildren. You're an angel! You're not at all like Cuco! I know her name's Cuca. It was a bad joke. You didn't like it, obviously. - I didn't mean to offend you. - No, you didn't. Alfredo. Thank you. That girl must take after her mother... ...because that widower is delightful. Why are you here, Mom? I waited for you half an hour. Get in. Okay. Tell me, how it went with the bar owner. Fine, fine, fine. We talked a lot about the paintings... ...but I don't know. - What? I haven't an Euro... ...so I'll have to throw my paintings in the river... No! You won't have to throw anything away! Look. No! No questions! Here. Don't tell your brother, either! My dear old woman. Don't call me old, either. They're from Mallorca. They're from Mallorca. Just how you like them. You went all the way there? No, I went to Velazquez street, but they're good. - We don't have a car, Alfredo. - Here, Dad. It's your decaf. By the way, did that Argentinean give you a check? No. What do you mean?! I talked to her son! She brought the money in cash. I had a feeling that woman would scam us. Your feeling was wrong. She brought the money. And Mrs. Elsa is very nice. Nice? She's an old hag, that Argentinean. Enough with the hag and Argentinean. Who cares where she was born? Dad, she didn't even pay her insurance. You should've seen how she treated her son! She exploits him! You're wrong about that, too. She's the one that helps him. He's a widower, he's unemployed... ...and has five kids. - Five kids? Yes, five. Well, how did that thing with the premises go? It's for a business we want to start. A cybercaf that is already up and going. We'd only have to pay for the lease and sale. Hugo, a friend and cousin of Paco... ...will go into business together... ...and we want to propose that you get in on it too. It's a great business, Alfredo. An opportunity. Yes, and you wouldn't have to worry about anything! Well, only about giving a bit of money. How much would I have to give? Sixty thousand. Actually, we need ninety thousand. Obviously, we'd take care of the work, don't worry. I don't know. I'd have to think about it. Look, Dad, we really need you to help us out. If we don't start our own business... ...it'll be really hard for us to make a living. It's been a while since Paco had a job... ...and it's not only for us, it's for Javier, as well. We have to think about his future. I haven't said no. Just let me think about it. Of course. Naturally. Hello? Alfredo! Hello, it's your neighbor Elsa. I'm in flat J. J as in Josphine. Oh, it's you! How are you? I'm fine, thank you. I wanted to thank you for your kind gesture. Yes, you've already thanked me. It's nothing. Well, that's the first thing I called for... ... and second, I do have to because it was a grand gesture. Tell me, have you had dinner? I hardly eat at night, actually. Yes, I know, you snack, right? Some cheese, ham. I was planning... thinking of something more formal. Some good liqueur, a bit of coffee... ...I don't know, whatever you like. It's not necessary. Alfredo, you're being a bit rude to me. Don't tell me it's too late... ...because I was looking at your room window... ...and you had your lights on yesterday till late, Alfredo! I may be rude, but you're a bit indiscreet. Alfredo, you didn't answer me. About the proposal with good liqueur and coffee. You don't know how important it is to me! Alfredo, let me thank you. Okay. All right. Very well, I'll see you here. Goodbye. He's so difficult. That's me in the picture! When I was young. If you'd met me fifty years ago... ...it wouldn't be hard for you to believe. Really. We were so alike. I didn't have a tummy, now it's really big... ...we were the same height, she was platinum blond... ...sometimes people would confuse us. It really bothered my husband, actually. - Twenty-three years. - Twenty-three? I thought you said twenty-seven. No! I surely said twenty-seven because I forgot... ...to add four years of courtship. Sometimes I say twenty-three others twenty-seven... ...depending on how much I miss him. I miss him less today. - What was that actress's name? - Anita Ekberg. From La Dolce Vita. That Fellini movie! - That movie with... - Brando? No! - No, no, with Mastroianni. - Mastroianni, of course. My whole life I dreamt of going to the Trevi Fountain. It's smaller than it seems. How do you know? You've been there? Yes, a few years ago. I never got Pablo to take me. Never. We had to come live here when that whole thing... ...that revolution went on. We came almost next door! We're so close to Rome! It's Madrid! But it was useless. He just didn't want to go. Anyway, a short time later he died. I always think he's somewhere regretting what he did. Now, I want to know a bit about your life. Tell me about your wife. - She was tidy. - Tidy. What else? She was tidy. Yes, she could organize everything. Your life, too, I suppose? Did you like that she organized everything? I suppose so. You suppose! You're not sure? Yes, yes. Now, an important question. Where you happy? - We got along well. - Like friends? I'm sorry but I think this isn't... I'm sorry! Yes, I know, I'm very forward. I shouldn't have asked. That's Bonaparte. He's still not used to the new house. But he's a dog. He'll manage. No, no, I have to go. Besides, I already had the promised coffee. Yes, so, you've kept your word. No, don't take this the wrong way, Elsa. No, not at all. Go see to your dog, I'll take care of the drink. Well... When it's not the bitchy daughter... ...it's the dog's dog. Good morning. Bonaparte wouldn't calm down at all. I was going to call you... Are those flowers to say you're sorry? No. I'm going to the cemetery. Oh, so they're for her. Well, give them to her and place them nicely. I just say it because the deceased was so tidy. You shouldn't go to the cemetery. Besides, it's pointless. How would you know? Let me live my feelings in peace, man! Okay, don't get worked up. I just want to see you well. You'll see me well when I am well! What's this? Coffee with caffeine? I make coffee with caffeine. And I tell you not to make it with caffeine... ...because it's bad for me! And I tell you it isn't bad for you. - I'm hypertensive! - And I'm a doctor! You have the problems of someone your age... ...that's all, but you love being sick. Look at all the pills you take. You don't smoke, you don't drink... ...but with all those pills you're asking for liver cancer. Shut up! - Do we go for a walk tomorrow? - I don't know. You went with Javi the other day. I told you not to talk with my grandson! Sorry, sorry, sorry. I messed up with that remark about your wife. Could we have our drink from last night? I didn't know you had company... ...that you had friends over... - This is my friend Juan. - She's my neighbor. - From apartment J. J as in Josphine. Don't say it out loud. Bonaparte could get nervous. Well, come in. I'll leave you alone. No, no, not at all. This drink can wait. Well, okay... It was a pleasure. The pleasure is all mine, Josphine. - Napoleon could be listening. - His name's Bonaparte. Bonaparte. Good afternoon. Who is it? Alfredo, Elsa. Your neighbor. Oh, Alfredo. I'm not presentable. It'll take just a minute. Am I angry at him? Yes. You're going to the cemetery at this time? They're for you, Elsa. I came for that herb drink. Oh, I'm sorry, I ran out. I drank it with my friends. Okay, anything else or is this it? I'd rather come in. All right. He let me go once, but not again. Are you talking about me or Bonaparte? You. Oh, Alfredo. I really like your manners. Come in, come in. He talked and talked nonstop. And he said horrible things! He talked for like an hour and twenty minutes! What did you tell him? That's exactly what he asked! "Won't you say anything?" I said: "Yes." That's what I said. I was sick of him. His talk tired me. Were you ever happy with him? Maybe at the beginning, yes, but it didn't last long. It was his fault. And you? What's the most daring thing you've ever done? Daring? I don't know. I did many things. I gave Cuca her schooling... ...a comfortable life to my wife... ...I lived for my family. I had a great job. I spent 40 years in the same phone company. How could you stay - How old are you? - Seventy-eight. - I'm younger than you! - Oh, yeah? I didn't like that tone. Yes, I'm younger than you. I'm seventy-seven. - Did you laugh a lot? - What a question! It's a really great question. I don't think I've laughed a lot. Too bad, but you still have time. You still have time! Just stay with me. As a neighbor, a friend... It doesn't matter. I'm sure you'll get your laughter back. That new dog food didn't suit him well. - It doesn't suit him at all. - Yes! I told you! You're starting to get back your lost laughter! It wasn't because of you! It was Bonaparte. Yes, it was Bonaparte. Poor thing. He's ugly, but I like him. You know what you're going to do now? You're going to finish your drink... ...you'll eat two cakes and I... ...Im going to play Bach. Bravo! - How are you, Elsa? - Hi, Doc. Have you done what I told you? Everything. Okay, not everything. I forgot to take the green pill on Friday. Why did you forget? Some love late in life, perhaps? Really? Well, we're just at the beginning, you know? Right now it could be called a strange friendship. How old? I don't know. Twenty-seven, twenty-eight... seventy-eight. But he's impeccable. He's in great shape. I don't know... He's a bit... opaque. Opaque? Yes, like his inner light had gone out. All his life he's been this boring person. He's never stepped out of line... ...or had an indiscretion! He loves being sick. Oh, no. I don't think he loves it. Doc. Doctor, this is a serious disease. Ask anyone who knows me if I've ever talked about... ...well, my condition. I've never done it! But he doesn't talk about anything else. He talks about death all the time. I'm going to make this dinosaur live, Doctor. And how far did this "strange friendship" get? Well, not very far, really. We're at the holding hands stage. We hold hands. Oh, God! There's another thing that doesn't help much. He recently became a widower. He's full of memories and guilt issues... ...but it's been hard for him. Be patient. We men are cowards. We go at a slower pace. I'm also going at another pace, Doc... ...so he'd better hurry. - Elsa, you're not in bad shape. - Don't lie to me, Doctor. I saw the tests. - The stocks are falling. - Yes. That's not good, is it? Javi, did your mother tell you to come play here... ...to make me company? No, I came because your TV is bigger. Isn't she home yet? What are you talking about, Javi? About Elsa. Have you done it? - I'm your grandfather! - I'm your grandson! How can you ask me a question like that, Javier?! I can if I want, Alfredo! You're all nervous! Come on, Anita. Don't fall down on me now. Look, it's Marcello. Marcello. Elsa! Hello! I've come to take you out to lunch. Why go out? We can order in and eat here! Is there anything more terrible... ...for spending the afternoon with a lady? Put on a tie and jacket and let's go. Okay, but I can go dressed like this, right? - No, you can't. - Why not? We're eating at Madrid's finest restaurant. I don't want to be seen with someone pitiful. - Look, this is my best outfit. - Why this sudden urge? I don't know. It's just an urge. Don't think so much! That's why you don't live! Change quickly. A tie, a jacket. I'll wait here. As you wish, Madame. You did some job on this poor man. Don't worry, I'll fix him up for you. What do you mean "why"? Because I love him. What's wrong? It's pure uric acid. I don't know how I'll feel tomorrow. You'll feel incredibly well... ...with the memory of this unforgettable night. This uric acid is excellent. I love you. Does love not suit your old, fragile self, either? Elsa, what are we? We're a man and a woman talking about... ...the benefits and detriments of this sirloin steak. - That's what we are. - No, I don't mean this. I mean us. I feel strange. Good strange or bad strange? Strange. I would like to know because... ...it's really important to me, Alfredo. I don't want to suffer... ...but, I don't know, my heart is feeling things. - You talk like a teenager. - I am a teenager! Yes, you're a girl in the body of an older woman. - An immature old woman. - You're an adorable woman. So you feel good strange. Can we become something... ...in the not so distant future? I can't believe it. You're blushing! You're seventy-eight years old and you just blushed. Impossible not to fall in love with you. Oh, God, I was so straightforward. What's wrong? It's a mountain of cholesterol! Stick your finger in and lick it! Those are bad manners! You know what? You're not scared of dying... ...you're scared of living! You're like a self-help book! - Aren't you scared of death? - No! No. Well, I'm going to clarify this concept. You are a healthy man... ...with the common ailments of old age... ...but that's not serious. The day you're really sick... ...you'll want to enjoy it all. You talk as if it's happened to you. It happened to me with my husband... ...when the doctor said he had a few months left. Poor man. It was horrible. Maybe it happened to you with your wife. She died of a heart attack and didn't have time to think. Honestly, I'm kind of a hypochondriac. No, you're not kind of, you're not a hypochondriac. I'll tell you what you are. I'll say it as we say in Argentina... ...you're a wimp! You're a wimp. Nobody's going to die from eating Madrid's best dessert! Finger! Finger. That's my boy! - To life! - To life! May it be wonderful. - I wish I'd met you before. - Stop complaining. We met and I'm happy with that. - No, allow me. - No, I was going to pay! I told you! It's an armed robbery! Give me that! I told you it was my treat. It's an armed robbery. - Do you have money? - Are you scared? No, I'm not scared, but we can't pay a fortune... ...for a piece of meat and a slice of cake. I'm not paying for a piece of meat and slice of cake... ...Im paying for the most wonderful night we've had. That's priceless. When something is priceless, you don't pay it. I don't understand. I'm going to count to three. On three, we get up and go. You're crazy! You want to leave without paying? Nobody will suspect the innocent old people. - One, two... - Wait! Wait! - We could go to jail! - Of course not. Three. Slowly. Slowly. - Start the car already! - It's starting! - It started! - Go! Go! So? Are they following us? It's okay, it's okay, Fred. You were already thinking the police would arrest us... ...and that your sweet daughter would bail us out. What's wrong?! What's wrong?! Doesn't it have gas? No. You are... The police! The police! It's okay. They're gone. They weren't after us. - It's okay. - It's okay? It's okay? You're crazy! I may be a hypochondriac, a wimp and a scaredy-cat... ...but you're crazy! Crazy! Insane! I'm not used to being with women like you! You spent many years with one woman... ...who was very boring. - Yes, but she was normal... ...serious and coherent! You are crazy! Crazy! You frighten me! Alfredo? What's wrong, Alfredo? I feel a pain in my chest. Take me to a hospital. Everything I taught you was worthless? Dammit, take me! Okay, but you'll have to wait for a taxi to come... ...because no ambulances come by here. You're crazy. Crazy, crazy. Everything seems to be normal. A little tachycardia but nothing serious. Did he drink a lot? Eat something heavy? Was there an argument? All of the above in less than two hours. Okay. Okay, well, I'll give you a sedative... ...and you'll go home and rest. Okay? Okay? I'll be right back with the prescription. Excuse me. Another pill for your collection. Why don't you go home? You'll never regret this night. I already regret it, I assure you. That's a lie. It's the best thing that's happened to you... ...in a long time and I know that one day... ...you'll thank me for it. Where are you going? Didn't you tell me to go? Wait for me. At least see that I get home. Okay. Can you imagine the waiter's face... ...when he told the maitre we left without paying? Okay, I picked you up here... ...so I'll drop you off here. - How is your heart doing? - It's getting better. You'll get used to it. The excesses. You're the greatest excess for my old heart. If you hesitate two more seconds, I'll leave. Is it too soon to ask you to let me sleep over? Only sleep, okay? It's morning. Yes. It's morning. Yes! Leave the pills, Fred. I'm your only salvation. Stop taking it for a week and if you're dead by then... ...I promise I'll by you every remedy again. Dad? Dad? What are you doing? I'm going to take a bath. Why did you come in without knocking? I was worried and... - Are you okay? - Better than ever. I've never known you to use the tub... ...and much less at this hour. - Never. What's wrong? And those pills? The blue is for blood pressure, the white for uric acid... ...and the round one for cholesterol. Would you mind letting me enjoy my bath alone? Dad, why this revolution? Don't quit taking your pills! Why does it annoy you that we worry! I don't need you to worry about me! I'm fine! From now on, ring the bell before you come in. When you come in, if you see I'm sleeping... ...or in the bathroom, or doing whatever... ...you know, intimately, knock on the door... ...like civilized people do. And don't treat me like a sick person, dammit! I'm fine! You're not entirely fine, Dad! Are you letting yourself die? I'm letting myself live. Go, please. Go. The door! Close it. What lyrics! Today could be a great day. Go get it. - What a beautiful song. - Yes. - I like it so much! - As much as I like you! - Really? Why? - Because you're crazy! Today could be a great day... ... where you're about to discover everything... ... if you live it like it's your last... Take your instincts for a walk and air them in the sun. Don't cut down on you pleasure if you're a spender. If the routine is wearing you down... ... tell it that it's enough mediocrity. Today could be a great day give yourself a chance. Hi! How is the love of my life? Oh, it's you! I'm fine. How are you, Madame? I'm wonderfully fine. Are you out? There's a lot of noise. Yes, I'm out. I'm going to have tea with friends. That's great! You'll have to introduce me some day. Fat chance. They're more dangerous than I am. I lied and told them you were old and full of ailments. But that isn't believable! How could you go out with someone like that? I also told them you are a big tycoon... ...and a major phone stock holder. Oh, wait. I think I'm going to crash. I crashed. I'll call you later. Write on the board that I have to buy tomatoes. EGGS I LOVE YOU GLOOMY ALIENATION It's strange that she isn't here yet. You know how she is. Unpunctual. Yeah. She's not the only one. - There are few people. - Critics are missing... Mendez is here. He's the worse. Well, I guess I'll get started. - Yes. - It's up to you. Yes. I'm going to start. Why don't you call her on her mobile? She has it turned off. We should've picked her up. She refused. Why? She doesn't have a car. She crashed it. I don't know what's wrong with her. She's strange. - She's acting all mysterious. - Well... There she is. Look. Sorry for the delay. We couldn't find a cab. This is my son Gabriel, my daughter-in-law Laura. This is Alfredo, my boyfriend. Hello? Good evening to you all. Thank you for coming. Tonight is very important to me... ...because behind these sheets are my dreams... ...and I want to share them with you. I want to open this exposition with my favorite offspring. It's called: "Explosion of Pain". It's the most delicate of all my creations... ...and I hope you like it and it thrills you... ...as much as it thrills me. Well, here it is. Can you see the intensity? It's so strong... You don't like it, I can tell. Well, I prefer figurative paintings. Yes, well... Well... I know... This... That, I mean, is art. It's art because there's nothing to understand. If art hits you, it hits you. If it doesn't hit you... ...it doesn't. Of course. Does he sell many paintings? He sells, he sells... He doesn't sell. That's why he put this together. I hope that the buyers aren't like you... ...who like their paintings pretty and all that. So, how can he support five kids with this job? Huh? Forget the question, I'm looking at that line... ...that horizontal line there that captivates me... ...and I don't know why. That horizontal line is the center... ...and I see a flower blooming from it. I think your son... ...doesn't approve of our relationship. No. You told him so bluntly. It didn't suit him. I'd like to see your daughter's face when she finds out. Fred? Oh, yes! This is Fred. I'm Alfredo Ponce Cabeza de Vaca. You hadn't seen my work, what do you think? Huh? - I mean, did you like it? - Yes, yes. Very much. It is so strong. It's so colorful. It's admirable. I hope you can continue with your vocation. To support five kids and a family... ...it must be very hard. Gabriel is the father in the family. - Yes. - No, I'm single. You can't do this if you have kids. Well... - Important question! - Yes? What did the critic say of this marvel? Oh, the critics. Well, two came. One left... Fine, it's all fine. Don't forget, it's Carla's birthday on Sunday. - Yes, of course. - Don't forget. - You're coming, right? - Of course. So? So? Don't fret, I'm ready. - Mom? - Yes? Why didn't you tell me about Alfredo? Oh, Alfredo. What did you think of him? - He's handsome, isn't he? - Mom, what's all this? How could you do something like this at your age? - Are you calling me old now?! - No, you are irresponsible! Oh, you scared me. You're one to talk! You are twice married... ...and this one is a lot younger than you. So, bite your tongue. Mom, what's your purpose with Alfredo? The purpose is... I don't know. To be together, right? I'm good for him, he's good for me. You know I haven't much time to plan... ...anything else with him, if that's what worries you. Does Alfredo know about your disease? No, he doesn't, and please don't tell him! Now, let's talk about more important things. Do I look pretty? Yes, you do, Mom. - Then, off we go! - Victory is ours. - Hello! - Hi. - Are you having a good time? - Yes, great! I'm glad. Does it bother you that I came? No! Of course not. You seem strange. Really? Well, I'm strange. Hello, how are you? What's that? "Country Morning". It seemed appropriate for a girl. - Really? - Yes. - I can't ask you for anything. - Mom! I'm sick of looking everywhere! It's not that easy! We wanted to give her a pony. A puny little thing. Besides, it'd eat the garden! - Ready? - Yes. Come on! Family picture! Laura! Carla! Come on! - Mom, I'll take the gift. - Okay. - Come here. Stand here. - Yes. Mom! Alfredo! Come on! Let's go. No? You wanted to come, so you came. You're here now! You'll play with the balloons, eat delicious things... ...sing Happy Birthday, and be in the picture! Come on, Mom! Come on. One moment! - Grandpa's missing! - Grandpa! - Is that Laura's dad? - No, he's mine. He cheated on me! It's that simple! He cheated on me! It's that simple! He wrongfully cheated on me! I didn't care if he was in love with someone else! I wouldn't have cared if he had an affair. It happens! Has it happened to you? - Never. - Of course. Never. What do you mean? You never felt attracted... ...to another woman that wasn't your wife? - Yes. To you. - To me? You're an exception. No, you haven't done it because you didn't let you. I haven't needed to. Well, it looks like Pablo, my husband, needed it. He did it and I found out by chance. A secretary or someone let it slip. After that, I confronted him and he denied it. I was forced to chase him... ...and catch him in the act so he couldn't deny it. That's what I did. - And you threw him out. - Yes, I... No! I let him choose! I opened the door and said: "If you're in love with another woman, go." No, it was better like this: "If you're in love with another woman... ...go!" That's what I told him. "Take the liberty to choose!" Or: "you're free to choose!" He was surprised. We talked about how we could work out our relationship. - But it didn't work. - No! It didn't. I was up to here. All I wanted... ...was to be even with him. He did it, I'll do it. So, I didn't know what to do and I organized a trip. I went to London with my friends. A group of women, alone. One day, my friends and I went to Tobelo Road... ...the street that has strip clubs... ...where the men take everything off... One of them approached me, a fine example. that were heaven... ...great hair... We got to talking... ...we had a few drinks, I asked about his fee... ...and I asked him in English. That's how I said it. He got the point and we went to a hotel. He was a professional. Mike, was his name. Very caring and... I don't know... handy. Well, it happened and I came back to Madrid. All I wanted was to tell my husband what I did! Just like him! We had some tea and I told him. Believe it or not, he didn't like the news. He didn't like it! He even got mad at me! That's when I buried him forever! Just consider this question: Did I or did I not have reasons to do that? If your car is crashed, I didn't do it this time! I'm looking for my father! Cuca, is something wrong? I came to see you and you weren't there... ...and I figured you were here. Will you be long? I need to talk to you. We'll talk later. What's going on, Dad? Mom's grave is still warm and you get involved with her?! I won't allow you to insult Elsa! She's an Argentinean usurper who... And I'm an idiot?! Is that what you're trying to say? Give me back the key to my flat. Sorry, and remember, you have to call... ...before you come. Wait, Dad! Wait! What's wrong with you? I'm very worried! You've been acting strange lately! Is it that woman? Dad, don't tell me that this is serious. You came to talk about this or about something else? We have to sign the contract for the caf on Thursday... ...and I wanted to know what you decided. If you'd rather we leave it for later... No, now is fine. If you think it's a good deal, I'll give you the money. Call me on Thursday before the signing... ...and then come pick it up. Okay? - Anything else? - No. Then I'll see you on Thursday. Go. Easy, Bonaparte. - Good afternoon. - Lf you're here because... Can we talk for a moment? What about? Can I come in? Come in. I don't know your relationship with her... ...if you're her husband, her ex-husband... ...her late husband... - This is the limit! She said I was dead? Yes, she did, but I can see you're more alive than me. I don't want any trouble. May I sit down? Excuse me. Look, Elsa is extremely dangerous. She makes stories up, she lies. You must be careful with her! I'm telling you... I loved her deeply. But you cheated on her. After she did it to me! With a stripper! I understood that happened afterwards... ...when she found out you were having an affair. That's a lie! She told you it was after? You see? She lies! She makes things up to appear like the good one! It was before! She was at a hotel, she called a guy who... She told me it was a friend's birthday gift! I found out and that's when I showed up! I saw her. I didn't know whether to kill her or kill myself. - You went to London? - London? It was in Buenos Aires! On the street! She said London?! Oh, please! She's never set foot in London! - Whiskey? - No, thank you. I don't drink. She always reproached me that. That I was boring, that I had no vice that I wasn't fun. I'm 10 years younger! - You drink, if you need it. - No, I need something else. Be careful, Alfredo. You don't know where this woman's been... ...and she'll destroy your life! - What else has she lied about? - Everything she told you! - It can't be. - Want to test me? - What else has she told you? - Many things. That she's an English teacher. False! She studied English with some tapes. She'll say she's missing her exam in Italian. - She never took Italian! - She hasn't told me that. She will when she says her dream was going to Rome... ...to se the Trevi Fountain. She'll tell you. She already did. - Is that a lie, too? - No, that's true. It must be Elsa's only truth. She told me you didn't want to go to Rome with her. She said she wanted us to go to the Trevi Fountain... ...and jump in like that chick in the movie with the stud! That's absolute madness, don't you think?! What for? So we could be arrested?! She's completely insane. Insane! Look... ...she's very dangerous, Alfredo. Listen to me. - Stay away from her. - I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Don't thank me. I'm only doing what I have to do. I don't want another man going through what I did. Thank you for your time. Can I ask you one last question? Is it true she looked like Anita Ekberg? The blond from the movie? She was marvelous. Monumental. The most stunning blond in all Buenos Aires. She didn't have the... When she came into view, the Earth shook. You know what? Don't let her get away. Good day. Good day. You talked to my grandson again. I talk to your grandson every day. We're following your adventure very closely. I won't tell you anything about Elsa. She's not the neighbor from flat J anymore... ...she's Elsa now. Have you done anything? Respect, Juan! Respect! You've fallen in love. I thought you only wanted company... ...a fling and bam... ...but you've fallen in love! Go figure! I don't use people, that's your style. Besides, you should know me by now! You're in love. It suits me. I see you're not taking so many pills anymore. - The doctor took some off. - I am your doctor! You were. I changed. - You're going out? - Yes, I'm picking up Elsa. She went out to lunch with some friends... ...and I won't tell you where. Let's go. Take me. Maybe I can hit on one of her friends. Fat chance! Elsa! Elsa! I'm in the bathroom! - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine! Dinner is ready! I'll be right there! You haven't eaten anything. You didn't like it? Yes, but... I'm not hungry. Want me to make you some tea? No. I want you to hug me. It's amazing. That scene is almost pornographic. How did you think of renting La Dolce Vita? Oh, Anita. What a wonderful woman. I saw her recently in a magazine. She's older... ...but still has that platinum blond hair... ...and those boobs. Is everyone on dialysis... ...very sick? What? Is everyone on dialysis... ...at risk of dying? You need dialysis? Will you answer me? That depends, you can live many years. What if you're an elder? What's wrong, brother? Elsa is on dialysis. What could happen to her? I don't know. I'd have to look at her file, but... But what? It isn't encouraging... ...in someone her age. Is my Elsa going to die? My friend... What time is it? It's quarter to five. Alfredo. What are you doing? Alfredo, what are you looking for? Are you busy? No, I haven't been busy for years. Then come with me. - Where? - You'll see. Where are we going? Good evening! May I ask what you've been doing all afternoon? May I know what you're doing tomorrow? What's this? Plane tickets? To Rome? Are you happy? Extremely! Do you want me ask him to go by the fountain? No! No, I want to find it myself... ...holding your hand. We have time. Don't fret. Did you call him? Three times! All I got was the machine! - Dad?! - Alfredo! - Why don't you use your key?! - I told you what he said, Paco! What if he's sick, Cuca? Dad?! Something is wrong. Go to the bedroom. Stop it! Please, Paco! Dad?! - Cuca. - What is it? "Dear daughter: I was thinking about the investment... ...that you and Paco proposed. I decided not to do it... ...and give that money another use. I'm investing it in being happy." Being happy?! "I hope you don't take this the wrong way... ...I know you'll be shocked. You don't understand my behavior, neither do I... ...but I feel fine right now. I'm in Rome at the moment." In Rome! "Fulfilling Elsa's dream. I hope I haven't caused you any problem. Surely you'll find someone willing to invest. It's a good deal. Love, your father." He toyed with us, Cuca! What do you want me to say? That he's right? I don't know. I don't know him anymore. And... it's okay for him to invest in his happiness. In his happiness?! Cuca, he's going to squander the money on that woman! What do you want? You want him to waste it in your cybercaf? Why? He doesn't care about the business... ...and that's fine. You know something else? I'm not interested in it either. I did it for you. Now, if you really want to do it... do it. Look for the money and do it... ...but do it yourself! Come on. Let's go home. This trip must've cost you a fortune. Someone once told me... ...while looking at an outrageous bill... ...that there are things in life that are priceless. Okay. - So you have money? - No. - You had to borrow it? - No. I stole it. No, seriously! Did you borrow it or not?! It was mine. - What's wrong? - She looked at you. - What? - I saw that girl look at you. What? These Italian girls are bad. Be careful. Why would she look at me?! She looked at you! This guy is mine! I showed them. Every Monday, Fellini called Marcello. He'd say: "Marcello, this can't be. We haven't seen each other. Next week, let's meet on Wednesday... ...at the Augustus Caf and hang out for a while." And of course, neither of them went! They knew they wouldn't go and they didn't care. Next week: "Marcello, it's Fellini." All over again! What's wrong? Was it here where they arranged to meet? It was right here! It's unbelievable! - It's a sign. - Or a lie. No, not that! Is everything you've told me true? Of course! What else could I say? I read it in a book! - But, precisely here? - Precisely here! I'm positive... Well, no, I'm not quite sure. No, I'm not really sure. I get confused. No, no, it wasn't Augustus. But there are so many. Titus, Andromacus, Constantinus... ...but they're not Emperors. I'm sure it was an Emperor. - I believe you. - Well... Tomorrow night. Tomorrow night what? I want to go to the fountain. As you say. - Did you forget the kitten? - What kitten? What kitten? How can you ask what kitten? - Didn't you see La Dolce Vita? - Of course I saw it! But I don't think you'd want me to... You thought wrong. Of course I want to. I want a cat just like Anita Ekberg's... ...little and white. - But, Elsa... No! I've dreamt about this for years. Years! - I want it like I dreamt it! - But... Please! I wasn't wrong when I said you were a teenager. Thank you. Is that a compliment or an insult? Your beauty is an insult to all other women. Ma'am, do you feel all right? I'm great! Good morning. No. At this time it's good afternoon. Oh, I'm sorry. Good afternoon. I need a cat. Did I say it right? A cat? Yes, a cat! A cat! A little one. A little one... and white. Yes, I know what a cat is but I'm sorry... ... we don't have animals in this hotel. I know... ...but she needs a cat. It's an emergency. I'm sorry, I don't understand. I don't understand. Is there a pet store nearby? Nearby? Animals? Oh, you want a cat. You want to buy a cat! I'm sorry, everything is closed right now. You know... Closed. Closed. Is there any other way... ...of getting a cat? Little and white? No cat. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Bye. - You're welcome. Are you looking for a cat? Don't look at me! Don't look at me. - Two hundred Euros. - Two hundred Euros? - Do you want a cat? - Little and white. Two hundred Euros. Little and white? Little, white, blue, yellow, red! Two hundred Euros. All right, all right. No! An hour and a half, in your room. This guy is scamming me. Little and white. Excuse me?! - How do I look? - Beautiful. Wonderful! What's that? - The cat. - Let me see. What's wrong? It's not really white. It's beautiful. Fred, we're not Anita and Marcello, either. Are we? Let's go. Oh, yes. Let's go. I'm very nervous. It has to be around here. Do you hear that? Give me the cat! But let's go! It's right there! The cat! Give it to me. - And some latte. - What? - A glass of milk. - A glass of milk? Yes, when they get here, not exactly but anyway... ...Anita asks Marcello for a glass of milk for the cat. Elsa, please, look at this place! There isn't a soul around! But, Fred, we came all the way here! We did everything, we have the cat, please! We have to find out in what dairy... ...Marcello bought the cat the milk. But Marcello didn't buy anything in a dairy! A guy from the set gave him the milk! Okay, okay, wait for me here. Come on! Get in! No, woman! We'll freeze! Who cares? Would you mind dying here tonight? Come on! Come inside! Get in! At a given moment, they're alone in the world. The noise of the water starts to fade away. Dear Marcello, I have something to confess. I love you. I love you more than I've ever loved anyone. Thank you. No, thank you. What do you think you're doing?! They're going to arrest us! They engraved the tombstone. She was older than you. Eighty-two years old. She didn't look it. Why are you laughing, Grandpa? No reason. You little fibber. SUBTITLES BY DISTRIMAX S.A. DE C. V. IN MEMORY OF
