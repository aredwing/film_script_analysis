Come on. Get up. Get up. Move it. Move it. Welcome to paradise boys. This is Coldwater. I am Colonel Frank Reichert. United States Marine Corps, retired. You can call me Colonel. You can call me sir. It's up to you. The choice is yours. Life here, gentlemen, is very simple. Let's not bullshit each other. You're here because you fucked up. We're here to fix that. So, you show me that you have a willingness and desire to change. Simple as that. You continue to work hard, keep your nose clean. You show a commitment to the process, leadership capabilities. When you've shown us that you can handle responsibilities beyond your petty little selves. Congratulations on that day. You are now a useful citizen. You can then write your ticket out of this place. Or you can stay, come work for me, pass on what you've learned. We take care of our own. Let me see that watch son. This watch is a lot older than you are. I'll hang on to this. You'll get it back when you're ready. Gentlemen, whatever shit you came in here with... let it go. If it was working for you you wouldn't be here. Make no mistake, we will readjust you because we are goddamn good at what we do. I put my heart and my soul into this process. I highly recommend you do that too. All right. Company dismissed. Powell. Yes sir. Ladies, you heard the man. Dismissed. Please stop! Please no! Stop! Please! Please, stop! No! Turn around. Strip. Turn around and put your hands against the wall. Only a couple more miles guys. Let's go! Pick it up! Get in line. Get some water. When the mail's finished, water break is finished. Man, I've got to get some fucking water. I know that shit. Come on, hurry up. Time's up. Can I have some water? Let's go boys. Move! Move! What in the hell we digging for anyway? - Irrigation ditches. - Irri what? Irrigation ditches. So they can water them fields down there. Yeah. Okay. Man, I'm tired as a motherfucker. Shit. Ain't never hurt nobody shoplifting. I'm going to whip some ass after this shit. What the hell you do? I just caught real high with the homies. This nigger. What about you? Did you go cowboy on some fools or what? Lucky bastard. Yo, Trevor. Come on man. Pop up. Hey, Trevor. What you don't want lunch? What the fuck? No, no, no. Wait, wait. No, no. Powell! Powell! Trevor what you... Powell! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Up, up, up, up, up, up. Trevor come on, come on, come on, come on. Trevor open your eyes! Powell! Get his arm. Get his arm. Get his arms. Come on! Come on! Come on man! Come on! Stop thinking about it. What? It's impossible. We're in the middle of nowhere, man. - Boots or no boots. - What am I thinking about? That fool Trevor made it out a few months back. Up and over the fence. His fucking family brought him back. They fucked him up good for that. Yeah. We didn't see him for a while. That's when they put a second double down. Now even trustee can't get out. I don't know. I think he's got a key hidden somewhere though. How long have you been here? A long fucking time. What? For getting high? Come on, man. Just go to bed. Jesus. He's sleeping like a baby. He must have blown his load already. His parents will get a bill if he did. Hey, you know you can't jerk off, right? Come on. You better get off me like that. - What the fuck you doing? - What'd I do? What'd I do? - Go. - What'd I do? Shut the fuck up. 100 degrees most days. You pass out in the dirt and they'll just let you cook. They broke you down. If you couldn't take it they took your privileges. They took your sleep. Still some guys like to talk tough. Some guys were just fucking crazy. You're not taking my boots. Casey, put it down. Drop the weapon. You want these boots, come and get these boots. - Step back. - Come and get them. - Come on! Come on! - Drop the weapon. I don't fucking need this. Let's do this. Come on, let's go. After a few weeks mostly everyone starts to lose it. Everyday was the same. Until you weren't you anymore. It was all routine. Come on. Watch it, watch it, watch it. - Shut up. - Ow, man. You'll be back in the barracks tonight. I'll be coming in to check on you. You'll be off your feet for at least a week. Fine with me, man. It's a week away from them assholes. - Yo, is Manny out to lunch? - What's up man? - Yeah. - Oh, thank God. I'm telling you man if you want that shit sold I got you. - Just throw me a little something man. - Put that shit away man. Okay. - Carburetor's flooded. - Yeah? - I need a... Phillips head. - Cool. Yeah. Oh, my God man. So, you coming to Holly's party tomorrow? Oh, yeah. - I heard she wants to rape you, dude. - Yeah? Oh, shit man. I need to get up on that. - Yeah dude. - Where's it at? It's end of Highland Trail. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, you've been there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. Yo, B! What's up? Hey, man, can I holler at you real quick? Fuck. Yo, I'll be right back. Come on, dude. We got places to be. Don't just show up to where I work. I told you if you want to deal with me call me like everybody else. Yeah, yeah. It won't happen again. Give me my money. You want it give me the money or fuck off. What the fuck are you looking at, yo? Yo, you need to get to stepping. What? No? What is this, huh? You come in to my work and you fucking short me? Chill. All right. What? Give it back to him. - You want it back? Here. - No, no, no. I don't want it back, but the last time I fronted you two assholes you took your sweet ass time. I want the rest tomorrow or I'm done with you. I'm sick of this you fucking speed freaks. Oh, all right. Yeah maybe we'll bring it by that party tomorrow night, huh? Where'd you say it was? Highland Trail? Look at this face, yo. Shit man. Shit what? Next time stand up for yourself. Jonas didn't kick at the ATV. Powell hit him. So, you're telling me that Powell and my trustee are both lying to me? Your trustee was nowhere near us. He didn't see anything. Counselor step out. Close the door behind you. All right, look. If you make enemies in here your road is going to be very long and a painful one. Jonas is not a victim. Neither are you. I want to keep it that way. Last couple of weeks you've shown good progress. Keep that momentum. That's how trust is built. So, tell me. Can I trust you? That a boy. You're dismissed Lunders. So, the stories you write every night, I mean do you just make them up as you go... or is it based on actual outside experiences? No, Brad. It's a barracks report. So what happens outside the barracks isn't important. So shut the fuck up. Since we're in the barracks now you should probably write this down. You're a chicken shit fucking weakling. You could have protected him, but you just go along with their bullshit lies. I wish... I wish I could get the chance to fucking come at you... and not have anything happen to me because I would tear you the fuck apart. You fucking pussy. I'm really not surprised you're a trustee of a place like this. You're messing with me. - Okay. Maybe a little. - You can tell her it was amazing. - Yeah, you are. Better. - Okay. Hey. Hey. Behave yourself. You're the only one I can count on, Erin. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Mm-hm. - If you start doing business there... - No, no. I won't. - Promise? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. - Trust me. - Yeah. Okay. - Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Listen, we've given this a lot of thought, and I think it's time that John came to live with us. You guys are selling the house? No. We're not selling the house. He's moving in. I love your mother very much, Brad. I just want to make her happy. - Oh, shit. Here we go. - What? Look... - I know we've had trouble communicating... - Wait a minute. You know what? You've never even given John a chance. Yeah, well he's not moving into this house. Yes. He's here almost every night already anyway. Fine. Come and go then. Mow his lawn. Take his couch. Sleep with his fucking wife. - Whoa. That's not what this is about. - You know what? Watch your mouth, young man. Yeah, what kind of fucking friend were you anyway? Huh? Thanks for dinner. Come on wake up time! - Let's go! - Let's go! Get up! Get up! Let's go! Today. Let's go. - How's the foot? - How you think? Let's go. Yeah, the fuck okay. I can't do shit. Sure you can. It's been a week. Nothing's broke. No, he can't. Jenson was here yesterday. He doesn't run. Trustee, has this inmate walked to and from the shower by himself? Yes, sir. Trustee, has this inmate walked to and from the mess hall by himself? Yes, sir. Twice now. In the trustee's opinion, can this inmate take part in this morning's run? Yes, sir. I'd recommend boots. Everyone, fall in. Let's go! Whew, man. Brad Lunders. Dude be swiping maps and first aid and shit. I'm taking you to the doctor's tomorrow so he can fix this up. Then you can steal something. Yeah, right. I don't care. I learned my lesson. Shit. I don't know how much my dad paid, but I fucking hate him for sending me here. What about your mom? Well, she don't know where I am. Mom fucking split, I was like 10. I don't think my dad would be that proud of me right now. I wouldn't be here I know that much. I'd rather be in juvie. At least I know when I'm getting out. At least I could call someone. At least I'd know when I'd be hitting it again, baby. Man, you got a girl waiting on you back home? I had a girlfriend. - Pretty? - Yeah, man. She was... beautiful. What? She break up with you? How about some more of your stash? Got bills to pay too motherfucker. - This is from today? - Today. Shit. Maybe. Hey, motherfucker. Don't I know you? What the fuck? I know you from... - Get the fuck out of my face, man. - What the fuck? Get the fuck out. What? What? What? Roll boy. I don't fucking know you bitch. See I don't take any shit. Hey. Look me in the eyes and say it. I said I won't take nothing from nobody. Ever. You need a fucking drink. Better go talk to Erin, fool. She's been looking for you all pissed and shit. Don't look. She's behind you. She's coming. I'm going to talk to Holly. All right? - Hey. - You're an asshole. Where were you? I've been calling you all day. Just been dealing with some bullshit. Come here. Come here. I need to talk to you. - So, you did get fired? - Yes. And Gabriel got fired. We both got fired. Got caught dealing. - What's the money for? - What money Erin? The money I saw Gabriel give you outside. What was it for? So, you're spying on me now? What does he owe you money for Brad? - Is Gabriel dealing for you? - I'm not doing this. We're having this conversation. Gabe does what he wants to. Get off my fucking back. I told you. He's not going to be dealing for me. Fine. How are you going to get him to stop now? - Are you fucking... - No, I'm not kidding. What are you going to do when your probation officer talks to your boss? - Seriously? - I don't know! I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't go back to juvie. I can't stay here. And I can't leave. I can't get out of here. You can fucking get out by yourself. Just go. Just go! If you want to... Hey, you guys need to leave. I think it's time... Fuck you bitch. Get the fuck out of here. - Get the fuck out of here before... - Yo, Eddie. What's up dude? Fucker. Piece of shit. Fucker! You fucking bitch! Hey! Brad! Stop it! Stop it! Get off of him! Stop it. - What's up now motherfucker? - What the fuck are you doing? Stop! - He's got a gun. - You want to fight motherfucker? You want to go bitch? No! Erin! Why? Erin! No! Get some help. Please get some fucking help! Erin! God fucking damnit! Whoa. Damn. That's fucked up, man. That's some hard shit. Well, we ain't going to accomplish anything in this motherfucker. These counselors are a bunch of tools, homie. You will leave Coldwater Ranch a responsible adult. Hey, you guys. Shut the fuck up. 25 miles, man. That's it. Might be here a while first. So, I got your back. Get up! Move! Move! Get up! Move it! Move it! Move it! Get up! - Explain this. - It's for his ankle. It's infected. I told you I snagged it from the doc after he fixed my foot. And I suppose you're going to use this... as a bandage? Look, I fucking took that. Okay? I took that. It was me. He had nothing to do with it. Hm. Double runs everyone. Next two days. And no downtime for a week. These two get another day to reflect. Don't forget the lights. Get the fuck out of here. Little bitch. Hey, Brad. Brad, you awake? Brad. Fucking nigger cripple. Turn. Jonas! Shut the fuck up. My leg hurts so bad. I can't take it anymore. I can't take this. Help! Let us the fuck out of here. Yeah. Yeah. I can still escape. What are you talking about? Yeah, I'll be there. Absolutely. Hey, Brownie! Brownie I've got a... I'll call you back all right? Come on. Angie it was an accident. It's right there on the report. You've talked to everybody and we are dealing with the individuals involved. He lost the whole fucking leg, Frank. I know that, but we did it by the numbers here. He was injured. He was treated, monitored, - ...there was follow up care. - The bruising on his neck. That happened in the barracks. - That's an entirely separate situation. - And his testimony. You've got Lunders' testimony. Your counselor is lying and I think you know it. I've got to tell you. You've got a big fight coming up. You put me in a bad place, Frank. All right, Mr. Reichert, I forgot to ask you how do the inmates get out of the barracks in an emergency? Oh, there's a hidden key. The trustees have access to it. A hidden key. Okay. Which trustees? - All of them. - All of them. Okay. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? - Yeah, I'm sorry. - You are a fucking virus. I wouldn't even make you a fucking trustee right now. I want you off my campus. Go. You're fired. Don't do this. Don't fucking tell me don't do this. Get the fuck out of here. You have ten minutes. Pack your shit and get out. Hey. Do you know what they're going to do to us in the morning when they see that you're gone? That's if they don't pull a surprise count. The next one's in four hours. No. You better make it worth our while and get away with it then. Key. Level three. He's gone. Must have used something to get over the fence. Hey. You all right? You have no idea how good this is right now. Come on. This way. Uh, Brad, this is Deputy Cross. Hi Brad. He's going to help you. I told him your story and I really think that you should be talking to him. Everything's going to be fine. You all right? I'm sorry, but I have to take you back. Maybe if you had some sort of evidence, proof to back up your story things might be different. I want you to have this. It was my dad's. It's yours now. Are you serious? Thanks Deputy. You give the Sheriff my best now. All we ask of you is hard work, respect and the willingness to change. This young man failed at all three. Now, he could be any one of you. So, what do I do? Do I just give up on him? Do I send him away like his parents did? No. We are in the business of transformation. That means I am patient. It also means that he must be held accountable for his actions. Take off your clothes son. What? Take your clothes off. Stop. Please. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Eat the fish. - You eat that shit. - Shut the fuck up. Eat the goddamn fish. Eat the fucking fi... Come on. Let's go. Get up. Stay there. The bastards just keep on coming don't they? You're on E. What happened to your family? Wife ran off with the fucking yoga teacher. Kid... put a bullet in his own head, end of his second tour. You got what it takes kid. You're going to be wearing blue real soon. What the fuck? What the fuck are you? What are you the fucking Gerber fucking baby, boy? Huh? What's your name son? - Billy Heckler, sir. - Billy Heckler, sir. You got tits, man. What are you in for? - Bad grades and ditching. - Ditching? Ooh! Gerber's a bad ass. Ditched a class. They're going to love you Gerber. Fucking Gerber. Oh, it's funny, huh? It's fucking funny. Where you from? Huh, where you from? - Plymouth. - Plymouth, ooh. Yeah, one of them religious pricks, huh? Guess it never answers your prayers, huh? What the fuck? Get them the fuck out of here. Holy shit. Brad. Either of you know engines? Yeah, yeah. I know a little. Let's go. How long has it been, man? It feels like fucking forever, dog. Come here. Fill the tank. All right. Whew. Fucking... I can't believe it's you, man. It's like you were dead, man. Your mom didn't tell anyone anything. What are you doing here? Couple of months went by, man, I got busted for some stash. You know, I was in juvie almost nine. Fucking this morning State social worker doesn't like me, man. You know what she tells my parents... Listen, hey. She tells them too much fighting. No change of behavior. Only a matter of time before state time. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All that shit. Guess our moms are still talking, huh? She'll get a discount now. What's up with you, man? What's wrong, fool? What are you doing here Gabe? After everything that happened, why are you here right now? Nice to see you too. What do you want me to fucking say to you Gabe? - Do you know where the fuck you are? - Oh, please. I ain't like I was... back in the day, little bitch and shit. Yo, I'm down now. I swear. How about you? They letting your ass out soon? - Soon. - Okay, well how long's soon? Oh, I see. You're moving up in the world, huh? I'm a trustee. It keeps them off my back. Man, you a trustee? You been out in these weeds all this time, huh? I thought those assholes in the van were bad. Man, that Colonel is off his rocker. It doesn't matter what I say. You don't fucking get it. This isn't juvie. This isn't some drug deal on the corner. This is something else. All right. What the fuck do you think I'm going to do? Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. - You got something to say, inmate? - No, sir. - If I did I would have said it. - Hey, finish up. Good. Lunders, what crimes did you commit? Underage drinking, battery and violation of probation, sir. What are you going to do about that Mr. Lunders? I'm learning to be a better citizen. So when I return to mainstream society I can function as a responsible adult. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Come on Lunders. What the fuck? You look tired. What the fuck's he doing? I think he's... probably waiting on his boyfriend. Right? I think so. I think so. Sorry. - You want some? - That sucks. There's a little bit left if you want some. Pick it up girls. Come on. You know Holly and I were together for a while before juvie. She got knocked up by some white boy. Oh, good. Yeah, it's pretty fucked up sometimes. I mean I think about that night a lot. Used to see her parents around town once in a while too. They hardly looked at me. You're not going to do this right now, are you? Colonel wants a word with you. What the fuck? Right now? They want you with the others. If you can't do it I can probably bullshit you into the infirmary for a few hours. - I'll tell Jenson it's dehydration. - Get these fucking handcuffs off. Listen, a kid lost his fucking leg here last year. There's a big lawsuit and this place is going to shit. So, until they pull the fucking plug you have to play along or I can't help you. You won't be here long. Yeah, well you know what? I can fucking take care of myself. Good, then fucking take care of yourself. Did you check his papers Josh? Who Nunez? No, I did not check his papers. I will ask him. Good job. I'm sorry. What the fuck? You got a fucking death wish motherfucker? - I'll take care of it. I'll handle it. - Yeah, you handle it. You fucking handle it over there. You handle your little boyfriend. - You know what you're a lot of talk. - Oh, yeah? I'm a lot of talk? Yeah, fuck you. Fuck you. If it was up to me I'd treat you like the fucking pussy you are and I'd take that armband off you and I'd beat you down like all your fucking friends. Yeah, fuck you. I'm not going to cry about it. I'm going to beat the shit out of you. You fucking piece of shit. - Let's go. - Fuck you. Let's go. I got you Josh. Clock this motherfucker. Come on! Let's go! - Get up Josh. - Come on. Come on. Get in there. Get up. Get up. Come on. Stay down. - Josh... - Come on. He's done. Walk with me. Fuck! Come on you fat fucks. Move it. Do not let me fucking catch you. What you looking at, huh? What the fuck you looking at? Stupid fuck! Up that fucking hill! Move! Move! What the... What the fuck? Bitch. - You fucking finished yet? - Yes, sir. Then why the fuck won't it work? I don't know, sir. The tank's topped off. It's water. It's fucking water. That's why it won't fucking work. Who the fuck did this? Don't tell me you don't fucking know! I will bust you down to fucking level one. You want to fuck with me? Huh? I'll rip you a new fucking asshole. No more privileges. No more downtime. Now push that piece of shit back to the fucking garage where the fuck it belongs. You can thank your trustee for that. I want to know who the fuck did this. Is that fucking clear? Yes, sir. Why the fuck are you standing there? Get the fuck out of my way. Move it! Fucking move it now! Watch it. Watch it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Pick him up. There we go. All right. Well. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, Brad. Look if you don't fess up to putting water in the tank everyone of these kids are going to be gunning for you in the barracks. Fuck 'em. They're animals. - You going to die me out? - I won't have to. They're not stupid. Besides, why do you think they haven't yet? Wow. Go on. Don't do me any favors big bro. I can handle my shit. Fuck you then. Fine. Pick up your goddamn tray! All right listen up. Your trustee has got something he wants to tell you. It's better if it comes from you. Gabriel filled the gas tank with water yesterday. He's confessed. All right. The trustee just showed you what progress looks like. He's leaving all that Plymouth, homeboy bullshit behind him. Nunez I suggest you follow in your friend's footsteps. He ain't my motherfucking friend, man. Does anybody actually know he's here for killing his girlfriend? Anybody know that? - It's a lot worse than that. - Oh, it's a lot worse than that? Well, why don't you tell them why you're here. Huh? Fuck man. I thought you were my brother. Yeah, well. That's where you fucked up. That's where I fucked up? - That's where I fucked up? Huh? - Yeah, you fucked up. That's where I fucked up, huh? Fucked up, huh? Yeah, listen to your boss, man. Listen to your fucking boss. Yeah, keep walking. Don't even fucking move. All right. We make mistakes. That's why we're here. Here's something funny. Somebody stole my master key yesterday. I am pretty fucking sure it was you. - What's up? Hm? - What's up? Oh, you're going to find out. Oh, no. One last time. Where is my key? I didn't take your fucking key, man. I don't know what fucking key you're talking about. Okay? Hm. What fucking key? I don't know what fucking key you're talking about, man. What I... Get the fuck off me. Come on. Stay still. Stop it! Please! Please! I didn't take your fucking key! Please, please. I didn't take your fucking key. I swear to God! Come on! That's enough. Oh, what the fuck is this? What happened to him? Let's get you something to eat. Yo! Yeah you going to let him fool you guys too? You know what? You make me fucking sick coming in here marking your clipboards, wearing your suits, backing up to this son of a bitch. You ain't any better than him. Waddle, waddle. You got something to say old man? Gabriel! Yeah, that's right. Get the fuck out of here pencil-pushing motherfuckers. What are you doing? What are you doing? They won't say shit because the minute you leave they'll get beat for it. - Get the fuck out of here. - You're digging your own fucking grave. This is it right here. Fuck you. Get the fuck out of here. Keep walking. Get off me! There's a hearing next week. You called them didn't you? Jesus Christ. I should have let you kill yourself Jenson. That way you could just die on your own terms, on your own time. Nope. I couldn't let you hit bottom. Could I? Had to give you responsibility. Guess what? All this, everything that's kept you alive... is going away, man. It's gone. There's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. You are fucked. I'm fucked. At least I can rebuild. I mean I'm going to start again. I've got guys who want it, got their shit together. Not guys fucked up like you. You catatonic, broken prick. We're done. Got that? So that means you can steal all the syringes you want, all the meds. Take 'em all. I don't really give a fuck anymore. Really. I don't care. All I want are my medical files and your keys on my desk. You're on your own. - The doc needs to see me. - Stop, stop, stop. He'll let me back in. Don't worry. They're going to kill you if you stay here, OK? I need you to jump the fence and get to Lincoln. It's 25 miles from here. When you get there go to the Sheriff's office and ask for Deputy Cross and give him this. It's... It's your medical file. It's all of doc's patchwork. I wrote everything that happened to you on the back. They're not going to send you back with this. Get it to them. It's 25 miles, say it. Gabe, 25 miles. I need you to say it. 25 miles. Yeah, okay. 25 miles. I got it. Good. You can do this. Yeah, I can make it. - Hey, where'd you get this? - Just take it. It's yours. I'm sorry. What are you going to do? I'll be fine. You should go though. I don't know. If those guys hadn't heard us talking under the car about Holly's party... none of this would have happened. Maybe. I'll see you Gabe. Jenson. Jenson. What the fuck? Jenson? Hey, this is Josh in the infirmary. You guys have to get over here right now. Fuck. Colonel, what's your 20? Colonel? Come in. Help! You've got to come to the infirmary! Right now. Come on! Come on! ...not responding. Lunders! Lunders. Sorry, my radio was turned off. Where are you right now? I'm in the barracks. Where the fuck do you think I am? Who let you back in the barracks? Jenson. 10-4. All right. You all know Gabriel is AWOL. The authorities have been notified so until the end of the day you're confined to your barracks. I'm sorry. Now... Dr. Jenson was found dead in his office earlier this morning. The Sheriff's Department is on its way. So, I don't really know if there's anything else... It appears Mr. Jenson put himself out of his own misery. Now, if one of you gentlemen broke in and killed him, fine. Medical files have gone missing. Those are Coldwater property. If I don't have them back by sundown I will kill each and every one of you. - Get them inside. - Come on. Let's go. Gabriel was sneaky wasn't he? Sneaky with the counselors. Sneaky with that gas thing, the truck. See, here's the thing that I don't understand is how did he get down off that crossbeam? I don't know. Ain't that a bitch. Dispatch to Morgan. You still at the Coldwater compound? 10-9. Copy that. I'm on my way. Use long-range recon. All right. Let me get back to you. Sir... they found a body on the side of the forest road. Male, possibly Hispanic, 15-17 years old, red t-shirt, blue jeans. Looks like one of yours. We're going to need you and another witness to identify the body. There was blunt head and facial trauma. Probable broken neck from falling head first after he crossed the road. It was dark. The forest road had no light and... there's a steep drop where he crossed. All other wounds and injuries are accounted for in the medical file you supplied Gabriel with. Along with your written testimony. The only real backup for your story so far. So, at this point you had no idea what was going on at the ranch while you were gone. What the fuck, man? Fuck you! How about now? How about now? Huh? Hoorah motherfucker. Yeah! Fuck, Colonel you need to come in right now! Fuck! Okay. Okay. Okay. You guys need to listen to me. Just look at me. Look at me. I'm not going to tell anybody. I'm not going to tell anybody. I just want to go home. Listen to me! All right? You need to let me go. This isn't me and this isn't fair. You need to let me go. I'm not going to tell anybody. Stop it! Stop it! Who's got the pickax now motherfucker? Who wants it? So, you get back to the ranch, with the Colonel. You saw what happened. The Colonel retires to his office. Then what? I heard a shot. Anything else? I called Lincoln Sheriff's office. Listen... can I get some water, please? Sure. His mom's here. Honey! I'm so sorry. I love you so much. I love you so much, honey. I'm so sorry about Gabriel. I can't even believe it. Brad! No, sir. Not right now. Yeah, I'm waiting to hear back from them. They've got a real mess on their hands. Let me call you back. All right? It was late afternoon yesterday, several inmates who either witnessed or notified authorities of the murders were brought in... You believe this shit? Below you're looking at one of the inmates from the facility right now. It's my understanding that there are about two dozen officers surrounding him. Caught four more outside Lincoln County. What do you think of Lunder's story? - He left a lot out. - That's for sure. Lincoln County Sheriff's here. It's going to be pretty crazy for a while with the media. All right? I'm taking you to another facility first. Sir... they found a body on the side of forest road. Male, possibly Hispanic, 15-17 years old. Red t-shirt, blue jeans. Looks like one of yours. I'm going to need you and another witness to identify the body. Brad, did you know Gabriel Nunez died trying to escape?
