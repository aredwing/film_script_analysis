EMILY: And she made fun of my hat! Remember? She said it looked silly. Oh, uh, right, and the thing about the hat. I mean, ahem, and the thing about the hat. Oh, Kaldorf, how bitter you've become. Have you forgotten all the wonderful times we spent together? You teaching me how to harness my power? Ugh, I do remember. I also remember how you grew mad with that power. I can no longer let my poor judgment... ...bring ruin to this town and its people. I won't let you do this to us. Not your niece, Drizelda. You've mistreated Athena for the last time. The only one being mistreated around here is me, Kaldork. Athena, tell this insufferable old crow... ...how well you're being looked after. I'm sorry, Auntie, but I'm staying here with Kaldorf. [GROANS] You silly little girl. These people aren't your friends. They're fools. [SOBBING] [THUNDER CRASHING] Anyway, heh, you don't have the power to banish me. Try, and I'll use dark magic to turn you all into wart ogres. [DRIZELDA CACKLING] [GASPS] ALL: You tell them, Auntie. [GASPS THEN GRUNTS] [GROANS THEN SCREAMING] [SHOUTING] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [GRUNTING] DRIZELDA [YELLING]: You will pay for this! [GRUNTS] And now that that's out of the way... ...it's festival time, people. MAN: Festival time! [ALL CHEERING] Yeah! Yeah! [BAND PLAYING UPBEAT FOLK MUSIC] Heh, I'm glad you stayed, Tom. EMILY: You shouldn't have kept the girl, Kaldorf. Who's to say she's not just as evil? She is a cat person after all. I love all animals. See? I saved him from one of Auntie's spells. [SCREAMING] She carries vermin with her! Oh, no, his name is Jerry. Don't worry, my dear. People's attitudes will change over time, I hope. See, Tom? Heh. Isn't he cute? I think you and Jerry could be great friends. ATHENA: Oh, Jerry. I'm gonna head into town to get food and hopefully some donations for the shelter, heh. Everyone seems to be much more pleasant during festival season. [GROANS] Aw. Thank you, Jerry. Now, while I'm gone, you and Tom are in charge. Got it? [CLICKS TONGUE] [SNORTING] [CHUCKLES] Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast, buster. Remember what happened last time? Energetic warthogs and construction zones don't mix. [WHIMPERS] Go on. [PANTING] [CHUCKLES] So how's the wing coming? [CAWS] Wish me luck, Max. [ATHENA HUMMING] [MAX CAWS] [WARTHOG SNORTING] [WARTHOG SQUEALS] [GROANS] [SCREAMING] ATHENA: Okay, today is a new day. Just stay positive. Elves are basically good people. BOY: Hey, Athena. Hi, guys. I hear an apple a day keeps the witches away. [GRUNTS] [ALL LAUGHING] Thank you for your donation to Athena's Shelter for Unwanted Animals. You again? How many times do I have to tell you? There will be no handouts. You will not get a bite from me, hmm. MAN: Attention, my good, good friends! The preparation of this year's Harvest Festival is underway. [BELLS JINGLING] We have tents the size of the town hall... ...the most beautiful fireworks display, as well as plenty of games and prize... EMILY: Oh, stop daydreaming. We are already way behind schedule. Uh, yes, dear, of course. EMILY: Athena. Yes, Emily, how can I help? You can start by going back to your shack... ...and making that sure none of those horrible creatures run amok like last year. That warthog of yours made this place look like a war zone. And I'm so sorry about that. [BLEATING] MAN: Somebody stop that thing! - No! - Excuse me. [EMILY GROANS] [BOTH GASP] [ALL SCREAMING] Easy, now. You're okay. MAN 1: Steady. MAN 2: We got it. Let's take a look. There. [CHATTERING] Three cheers for Athena! - Hip, hip! ALL: Hooray! DAMON: Hip, hip! CROWD: Hooray! Hold everything. Huh? Remember, this is Athena. Let's not forget who she's related to. And if any one of her beasts gets out, the festival could be totally ruined. Oh, they won't get out. I have it all under control. Maybe we should give her just one more chance. I second that. Hmm. Oh, all right, just this one time. WOMAN 1: For the animals. MAN 1: Here you are. ATHENA: Thank you. So generous. WOMAN 2: Here. MAN 2: Aah! - Uh-oh. [SQUEALING] [SCREAMING] Oh, no! No, no, no. [LAUGHING] This isn't happening. Look out! [PANTING] Please, no. [SQUEALING THEN PANTING] [ALL SHOUTING] [GASPS] [SQUEALS] [EMILY GROANING] Get that freak out of here! [GASPS] MAN 1: Who's gonna clean up this mess? MAN 2: Not gonna be me. [CRYING] ATHENA: Oh, no. Why do I bother? They'll never accept me. [SOBBING] I'm sorry, guys. This isn't fair to you. Someday I'll make everything better. Someday I'll find where we belong. [SINGING] There's a place for everyone For creatures big and small I've made a place for everyone As best I could in all My life is like one big menagerie But will I ever find a place for me? [BATS SCREECHING] I help those who can't themselves And make them all feel good But where's the cure for always being So misunderstood? [SHOUTS] Don't get me wrong You're all fine company But still I need to find a place for me Sometimes I feel as bad as you A self-defeated elf But maybe I can find the truth Deep within myself And maybe everyone will then agree That I found a place A warm and cozy space When I have found my place Yes, I will find a place [GROWLING] That's meant for me Huh? Heh. [CROCODILE GROWLING] [SCREAMING] [ATHENA SCREAMING] [GROANS] Hey, I'm getting the feeling we ain't welcome here. Yeah. Uh-oh. Yeah, not welcome at all. Not welcome one bit. Go on. You should more scared of disappointing Auntie. Yeah, disappointing Auntie very bad. Very bad idea. Wouldn't want to do that. Looks sort of scary in there. Yeah, it's definitely very scary. Frightening even. - Go on. PAN: All right. Uh, Tin, we ain't the first ones who been here. PAN: Yeah, not the first. Definitely not the first, second or third. Probably number 17. Seventeen, 18. [SHOUTS] [SHOUTING] Hey, look, Tin, one size fits all, ha, ha. Quiet. We're not looking for just any treasure. Auntie only wants the big round pearly thing. She says it'll be easy to spot because... It glows. [GRUNTING] Oh, you keep it, heh. Go ahead, it's yours. I don't really need it. I got it. Let's go. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that. - Yeah, don't like it at all. Not one bit. - Hush. [DRAGON GROWLING THEN ROARING] [ALL SCREAMING] TIN: Run for your life! PAN: Running! Running for my life! [ALL SHOUTING] ALLEY: Stay away from dragons. Stay away from dragons! [FROG CROAKING] [CHUCKLING] ATHENA: Here you go, Jerry. Oh, heh. Jerry, can you get Tom to fill this? [SNORING] [THUDS] Water. Now. [LAUGHING] [DRIZELDA CACKLING] DRIZELDA: Where is it? Where is my treasure? Heh. Come now, show your old Auntie Drizelda. Not those trinkets. You know the treasure I seek. I do, and I've got it right here. [GASPS] No. [CHUCKLES] I thought it felt kind of light, heh. Where is my dragon's egg? - Dragon's egg? - It, um... - Uh, must have fallen out. - Fallen out, on the ground, gone. - You lost it? - No, not really, no, heh. Of course not. Dimwits! That dragon's egg means everything to me. What it contains could give me more power than Kaldorf ever dreamed of. I'd at last have my revenge on him and that infernal hamlet. Um, maybe we can find it. Oh, you're going to find it, all right, heh. And this time, your old Auntie Drizelda is going to help you. [ALL SHOUTING] A pinch ofpotion this A dab ofdarkness that Ah, it's easier to seek and find When a cat is halfa bat [ALL SCREECHING] Search high, search low Search far and wide Find me that egg Or I'll have your hide! Oh, it's an egg. It won't hurt you, Tom. You do have to keep it warm, though. Come on. Ooh! [GRUNTING] Hey. [GRUNTING] There'll be some cream in it for you. But you cannot move from the egg. Hmm, I just have to find out what kind of egg it is. [CROWS] Ah-ah-ah. [SNIFFING] No, no, no, hmm, no. Oh, that's it! It's a dragon's egg. Tom, you're supposed to be with the egg. Oh, my, it's hatching. Mama? [CHUCKLES] Tom, he thinks you're his mother. [COUGHS] Heh, what a cute little puff. I'm gonna name you Puffy. [SNEEZES] [SIGHS] Oh, such a sweet baby. We're just gonna have to take care of him. Though this is the first dragon we've ever had. I'll talk to Kaldorf tomorrow. He'll know what to do. Mama. [GROWLING] [CROWS] [THUDS] Mama, heh. Heh, good morning, Tom. How's our Puffy doing? Now, keep an eye on him. Morning, Jerry. Don't forget to make your bed. Breakfast. Bread. [ALL CHIRPING] [PUFFY SLURPING] Like the cream, Tom? I got it special for you, just like I said. Mama. [HICCUPS] [THUDS] [CHUCKLES] [BOTH LAUGHING] [GASPS] PUFFY: Mama. Tom, you're supposed to be watching Puffy. Huh. Where'd he go? [BIRDS CHIRPING] [WHISTLES] PUFFY: Mama! Oh, no. [CHATTERING] Higher, higher. A little higher. Huh? EMILY: Higher. [PUFFY YELPING] Higher. A little higher. Oh, perfect. [SNEEZES] [SNIFFS] Gesundheit. [EMILY SHOUTING] [GROANS] [IMITATING FLY] [EMILY GRUNTS] That's it! You've used up the last of my patience, fleabag. [GROANING] [CHUCKLES] ATHENA: Oh, that was close. If the Elf Elders knew I had a dragon in town... KALDORF: You would be banished. - Huh! Kaldorf. They think only witches consorf with the likes of ogres and dragons. - Oh, uh, I was going to tell you. - Well, now I know. Well, what should I do? Send him back to the wild where he belongs. - But he's a helpless baby. - You have no choice, Athena. Your little friend here would be all the proof they need to cast you out. I can no longer protect you from them. I'm getting too old. - Promise me you'll do as I say. - Uh, but... Promise. - Well, I mean, uh... - Athena. Okay, I promise. It's for your own good, young lady. Okay, boys, take Puffy back to our house. I didn't say when I'd do it. I will send Puffy away... ...when he's older and can fend for himself. Until then, somebody's gotta take care of him. I'll find a cage to make sure he doesn't get away again. See you back at the house. [PUFFY GRUNTS] [SOBBING] Mama. Ha. Mama. Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama. Mama. Heh. [SIGHS] [CATS LAUGHING] TIN: Well, look in here, heh. If it ain't Tommy boy. Remember us, Auntie's favorites? Why, you got what we've been looking for. - I don't see no egg. - Yeah, definitely no egg to be seen. The lizard, you losers. The egg's been hatched. We're bringing Auntie back something even better. [CATS LAUGHING] [SCREAMING] [CHUCKLES] I gotcha. Talk about halitosis. [SCREAMING] [CHUCKLES] TIN: There he is. [CATS LAUGHING] Get him. Bramble bushes! [CATS SHOUTING] Ah. [HORSE NEIGHS] ALLEY: Anyone bring some ointment? PAN: Yeah, could use some of that. Definitely could use some ointment. Aloe vera. Hey, guys, I'm back with Puffy's cage. Tom! Jerry! Why can't anyone follow directions around here? [FIRECRACKERS WHISTLING AND CRACKING] [CROWD CHATTERING AND CHUCKLING] Kaldorf, you haven't seen Tom and Jerry, have you? Uh, no, Athena I haven't. Come to think of it, I haven't seen them for some time now. Oh, okay. Great. Athena, I assume you've taken care of the problem? Guh, uh... Yes, of course. So taken care of. [THUNDER CRASHING] [ALL GROANING] [GASPS] Drizelda. Ah, Kaldort, heh, how long has it been? Oh, right, ever since you banished me. And I can do it again if I have to, Drizelda. No, you won't. You're too old and I'm too powerful. Well, I will be. We're not scared of you and your niece. - Huh? - Athena, you're not like these dolts. You're like me: smart, daring, vivacious. It's not too late to come back to Auntie. Just tell me, where is the baby dragon? No one's seen a dragon for ages. I'm not the only one looking for it, you know. Listen. [DRAGON ROARING] Mama? Athena, you don't still have the baby. [CHUCKLING] Oh, please, Kaldort. She'll hurt him. Let's speed this up, shall we? [CACKLING] [ROARING] [KALDORF GROANING] Kaldorf. [HORSE NEIGHS] [PUFFY GROANING] PUFFY: Mama! - Huh? - Oh, baby needs a nap. Ah. Auntie, no! TIN: Let's go. [DRIZELDA CACKLING] ATHENA: Please! We have to save him. He's in terrible danger. Well, better him than us. We've had enough of your animal antics. - Emily... - No, Kaldorf. Tomorrow I'm shutting her house down for good. The cat, the vermin and whatever else is in that rat trap leaves this hamlet. And she's welcome to join them. [DRIZELDA CACKLING IN THE DISTANCE] Well, then I have nothing left to lose. - Huh! What? - Athena, where are you going? It takes a full night's ride to get to Drizelda's place, but I'll get there in half the time, hyah. [HORSE NEIGHING] [GRUNTS] In you go. [CHUCKLING] [GASPS] [CACKLING] Is our little pet collared and comfy? No? Well, the sooner you help me, the sooner this is over. All I need from you is a little heat. [SINGING] You see, right here is a stone that I hold More valuable than any riches or gold With a power inside that can never be beat And to set it all free I just need some heat Just give me some heat A little heat [SCREAMING] Notjust any kind ofhot will do Not a torch, nor the sun No, it's all up to you So, what do you say? Help your old Auntie out You know what I'm talking about I'm talking 'bout heat Just give me some heat A little heat [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] So fire it up, hot stuff What do you say? Shall we take it easy Or do this the hard way? Yes, yes. [BLOWS RASPBERRY] Fine, we'll do this the hard way. Bring me the grinder! Grind him, boys. Huh? Ah-ah-ah... [GIGGLES] [SNEEZES] DRIZELDA [SINGING]: Sorry 'bout that It's the price you must pay When my magic takes hold And takes your breath away So you better get ready And hold onto your seat The time is now for my plan to complete I just need some heat Just give me some heat A last bit ofheat 'Cause I am feeling The heat [CACKLING] Say hello to Auntie. [IN UNISON] Hello, Auntie. - Hey. - And goodbye, Auntie. Coming through. Jobless. Definitely jobless. Looking for work. Hyah, hyah! Hyah! [HORSE NEIGHS] [GASPS] I hope that's the wind. [DRAGON GROWLING] [SHOUTING] Jump! Gotcha. [ATHENA SHOUTS] [SCREAMING THEN GROANING] Run! Uh... Um... You're looking for your baby, right? We are too. We're your friends. We've been taking care of your baby. [AS PUFFY] Mama. Kaldorf, I forbid you to bring back that girl. Dear, I don't think you can forbid a wizard. Well, you'd think he'd have better sense. Sense seems to be at a premium here. If everyone had just opened their eyes... ...and seen Athena as the kind-hearted soul she is... ...maybe this whole calamity could have been avoided. [DRAGON WINGS FLAPPING] Oh, I fear it's just beginning. [ALL SCREAMING] Hello again, Kaldorf. This time I come bearing gifts. Don't think of it as a statue... ...but as a marker to mark the spot... ...where a hamlet filled with fools once stood. Be on your way, Drizelda. You're going to stop me? [CACKLING] Step aside, you silly old wizard. You will stay back! [GROANING] By the authority granted to me by the enchanted order of Elder Elves... ...I, Kaldorf the Great... Oh! Wish you hadn't done that. Or that. Or that. You know, I used to think you were powertul, Kaldorf. But now I look upon you more as, uh, lunch. [DRAGON ROARING] Huh? [GRUNTING AND GROANING] - Are you okay? - Well... That's right, Mama. Your baby just went rock-a-bye-bye. [GROWLING] [GRUNTING AND GROANING] [GASPS] [LAUGHS] I was waiting for that. It's the stone, Athena. [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] You must destroy the jewel around Drizelda's neck. [GROANING] Come on! [ROARING] Now to turn your happy hamlet into a tasty omelet. No, you don't, Auntie. Foolish child. I hope you don't think I'm going to be lenient with family members. [BATS SCREECHING] You will stay back! I proclaim it. And just what do you think you're going to do with that? Uh... Ugh! [SHOUTS] I'll get you! [ANIMALS GROWLING] Oh, no, you don't. Get off! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [ROARING] [DRIZELDA ROARING] [GRUNTING] Look out! [SHOUTING] That stone is mine. No! [SHOUTING] [GROANS] Mama. Mama. Mama. [CHUCKLES] [SOBBING] Aw. [CHUCKLES] Goodbye, Puffy. Goodbye. EMILY: Athena. Uh, yes, Emily? I've been such a fool. Can you ever forgive me? Oh, heh, of course. Three cheers for Athena, savior of the hamlet! - Hip, hip! CROWD: Hooray! EMILY: Hip, hip! Hip, hip! CROWD: Hooray! [WARTHOG SQUEALING] [GASPS] [EMILY GRUNTING] [ALL GASPING] Have I mentioned lately how much I love these animals? Hey, what do you know? She loves animals. Come here, you. You're so sweet and huggable. [ALL CHEERING] Kaldorf. I can't believe this is finally happening. My dear, with a heart like yours, it was always only just a matter of time. [SINGING] There's place for everyone For creatures big and small I've made a place for everyone As best I could in all My life is like one big menagerie And now I've finally found a place A place where I'm embraced I finally found a place That's meant for me DRIZELDA: Don't even think about it.
