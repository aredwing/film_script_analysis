[PANTING] With its full body and breathtaking smoothness, Wild Times is the whiskey that goes down easy. [POLICE SIREN BLARING] That smooth, great taste, it could almost make a girl jealous. [SIRENS WAILING] [POLICE SIRENS WAILING] [MAN]: No. Please. No. [HIGH-PITCHED FEEDBACK DRONES] [SCREAMING] [] [BEEPING] [] Happy birthday, mi amore. I wanted you to wake up and find this. I'm sorry that I had to work early today. But I promise I'll make it up to you tonight. [GIGGLES] And... Oh. I think someone else wants to say happy birthday to you too. [BLOWS KISS] Luke. [CAR ALARM BEEPS] Watch your head. You're mad. I'm not mad. We don't have to go. Oh, we're going. [ENGINE STARTS] I love you. I know. [] [TIRES SCREECHING] [WHIRRING] [WHIMPERING] [SIGHS] Ronnie. Look at me. Look at me, Ron. Here's my hand. Just hold on. Look at me. Veronica, please stay with me. Look at me. Listen to my voice, Ronnie. No, don't close your eyes. Look at me. - [VERONICA GROANS] - Veronica. [POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING] Veronica. [LABORED BREATHING] My wife. How's my wife? [GROANS] Let's take a look here. [BEEPING] Oh, look, that insurance just expired. Take him to F-ward. Oh, uh, sorry, doctor, I'm new. What's F-ward? Severe brain trauma. No medical insurance. Give you three guesses what F stands for. [] [TIRES SCREECHING] I'll check on Lieutenant Ramirez. I'm sorry, who are you, gentlemen? What exactly is this? [HIGH-PITCHED BEEP] Good morning, doctor. I am, as I'm sure you know, Virgil Kirkhill of Hope Industries. About an hour ago, a man was brought there after a car crash. Severe head trauma, no insurance. That's no problem for us, and we can save his life. I've heard rumors about this procedure and to be honest, I'm very skeptical. So in your opinion, we should let the patient die. I'm not saying that. Mr. Gibson could lead a normal life. I, uh... I'll need to consult with his next of kin. He has family? A sister. All right. May I speak with her? As you wish. [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA] Doctor. How is he? Not much different, I'm afraid. But there may be a new option open to us. We've got a special surgical team from Hope Industries already en route. And we'll make sure your brother gets the very best care available today.

[] There was a... Ahem, a man there. You've had an operation. You were in a car crash. Your sister's here. I'll... I'll get her. [SIGHS] Psst. Hey. You've been out a long time. Sorry. Name's Bennett Jackson. I don't even remember my own name. Yeah, I hear you, man. Neither could I when I first came round. I had to get it off my med chart. Ain't that a kick in the head? I heard them calling you Gibson. [GRUNTS] Yeah, it itches like a mother, don't it? I got one too. And that ain't even the worst part about it, man. I've been seeing things. Things I ain't even sure are real. They did something to us. Something not right. Thank God you're alive. Luke. Luke, Veronica didn't make it. She's gone. I'm sorry to hear that. He doesn't remember his own wife. We did try and warn you. Will he ever get it back? His motor skills and cognitive memories are intact. He can remember how to tie his shoes. But he has no memory of what his own shoes look like. Hey, I'm right here. There's a man there in a suit. Selling a watch or something. [] [CAMERA BEEPING] [MAN]: Got him. [MAN 1 ON RADIO]: This report brought to you by Hope Industries, the way of the future. [WOMAN ON RADIO]: U.S. markets are starting a slow crawl back up to pre-depression levels. The dollar continues trading at one-tenth the value of the Chinese yuan. [MAN 2 ON RADIO]: The corporate environment committee continues to deny sporadic snowfall with exceedingly high pH levels across the Eastern seaboard is a result of the fusion meltdown at the Beaksfield facility. [] Here we are. [CANDACE]: It's this way, Luke. [MEN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [CANDACE]: This way. Come on. [LUKE]: I live here? [CANDACE]: Yeah. It used to be nicer when you guys moved in, you and Veronica. Before the bailouts failed and most governments went bankrupt. Do you remember recent history, or...? [LUKE]: And Veronica's my wife, right? [CANDACE]: Come on. Let's get you inside. [WOMAN]: Sir, Subject 17's fail-safe just activated. [SCREAMING] [DOOR CLOSES] This way. You and Veronica lived here. [] You loved her very much. I was in the Army. Special Forces. Two continents. Three wars. You didn't like to talk about it much. You said you wanted to forget that part of your life. [LAUGHS] I should be careful what I wish for. I can't remember any of this. I'm gonna stay here tonight, make sure you're okay. You're Candace, right? My sister? Yeah. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING AND CHILDREN LAUGHING ON TV] [WOMAN ON TV]: The market took another dive today at fears of renewed hostility overseas. On the good-news front, today's report from the mayor's office concludes we're making real progress on the war on crime. Violent crimes have dropped by 35 percent since the same time last year. With only 241 murders reported in the last 60 days. [TV ANNOUNCER]: This report brought to you by Wild Times whiskey. [TURNS OFF TV] I love a man who knows what he wants. But if what he wants is Wild Times whiskey, well, then I love him even more. How'd you get in here? With its full body and breathtaking smoothness, Wild Times is the whiskey that goes down easy. That smooth, great taste... It could almost make a girl jealous. [CANDACE]: Luke, what's wrong? Did you just see that woman? There's nobody here. [GASPS] I gotta get out of here. Luke? Luke.

Man, I came to ask the good doctor the same thing you did. Now I'm glad I didn't. Guess that's a taste of what they'll do if we keep asking too many damn questions. Who's "they"? Man, the last time you asked that, your melon damn near split open. [SIGHS] We're being used. Human lab rats. How is this possible? Are you kidding me? Hope Industries? Randolph Hope owns, uh, pretty much everything. Now he owns us too. The space inside our heads. Hi, my name is Carter Burke. And if you're a man of class, a man of distinction... Hi, my name is Carter Burke. And if you're a man of class, a man of distinction, a man who values quality above all else... Whoa, whoa, hold it. I got some advice for you. The ads you've been seeing, they don't ever let up until you buy whatever crap it is they selling. Now, me, I ain't got no money. So I'm having to steal the shit. That works too. Trust me. It's the only way to make them stop. [] [CAMERA BEEPING] MAN [OVER MONITOR]: Aeon 3. [BURKE]: My name is Carter Burke.

[] [MAN ON MONITOR]: Gentlemen, there is a potential security breach in Project 660. Subject 373 received a class-one implant on January 7th. Initiation was successful. Subject's reaction to initial uploads of real-time audiovisual stimuli was within normative range. As in 48.6 percent of all other cases, multiple uploads had to be broadcast to gain full compliance. Then last night, at 2300 hours, Subject 373 questioned the implant and a warning pulse was activated as per standard operating procedure. Two hours later, subject successfully acquired product by extralegal means and was confronted by security personnel. Surveillance risk assessment indicated high probability of disclosure and automatically triggered the fail-safe mechanism. Except in this case, it didn't work. We activated Subject 373's fail-safe but it did not detonate. The termination code was blocked. - How? - We don't know how. We're working to override the blocking program, but it will take time. He's a belligerent subject with just enough information to make him dangerous. Unless we can activate the fail-safe, Mr. Gibson is a serious liability who could expose Project 660. We have the avatar program. That's proven effective. The avatar program has been successful so far. But Project 660 is too important to risk. It requires more stringent safeguards. Projections indicate a 146 percent rise in share prices, creating a self-perpetuating revenue stream of 21 billion dollars per year. Randolph Hope feels the assets are worth defending. Gentlemen, meet Mr. Drake. Mr. Drake knows how to defend an asset permanently. This is Subject 373, Luke Gibson. The asset is in his head. Shouldn't be a problem. Good. Let's get to it. Right this way, Mr. Drake. [] [WOMAN]: Have you heard about Juicy Fruit bubblegum? Brand-new flavors for you to enjoy. There's Mulberry Mint, Chinese Chocolate, and my favorite, Passion Fruit Power. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [] [BOTH GRUNTING] [BONE CRACKS] [BEEPING] [RAPID BEEPING] [GRUNTS] [] Hello, Luke. Been a long time. Product is on foot, engage at will. [] [BEEPING] [RAPID BEEPING] Goodbye, old friend. Come on, get in. We've lost the product. Clear out, clear out. One, two  Hey, hey, hey  Shacked up right now  Hey, hey, hey  I'll show you how  I've got this information Running round my brain  Hey, you all right? Nice moves out there. Who are you? We're your guardian angels. [] [MAN]: Of our 660 current subjects, this group has shown the best response rate to the implant technology. [WOMAN]: Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt. Subject 373 has eluded the intercept team. Ah. Mr. Gibson. - So good of you to come. - This is Hal. Let's get inside where it's safer. Now, this is what's happened. Hope Industries has put a computer inside your head. They're trying to develop a whole new way to manipulate mankind. - We should let him rest. - [HAL]: No, there's no time. If we don't hurry, this man's brain is gonna end up as a wet spot on a wall somewhere. I apologize. In actuality, we have a little more time than that. You see, our Keyboard is a lot smarter than their techs. He's like our secret weapon. Can he get this thing out of my head? Not exactly. But there is a computer in your skull. So Keyboard can hack it. Mr. Gibson, this is Keyboard. [RESPIRATOR HISSING] [COMPUTERS BEEPING] You can say hello. Not too close. Keyboard used to work for Hope. Resident computer genius. That is until the boy found out just how evil the corporation was and he tried to destroy them from the inside. With the baddest computer virus ever written. The Xenogen virus. [HAL]: He introduced the virus into every computer he could get his hands on. He came within a hairsbreadth of bringing the corporation down. But they found out who wrote the program. And put a bullet in his head. It damaged the part of his brain that controls speech. Hope Industries did this to him? Mm-hm. Why didn't you call the police? [SCOFFS] The police? His mother tried to do that. We found her body a couple of days later in a river. Um, the fish had eaten away most of her face. You see, Mr. Gibson, the first time this government's treasury went bankrupt, Randolph Hope and his corporation single-handedly bankrolled the next two wars this country was involved in. Now, with that kind of clout, what chance do you think we would have if we went public? - They'd kill us. - [HAL]: We have to hurry. It's a matter of time before the Hope techies find a way around the hold that Keyboard has on that device that's in your head. You see, he's hacked right into the chip they put up there. If it wasn't for him, they would've detonated your head days ago. You see, have a look. Your headaches? That was Hope trying to pull your plug, man. And we stopped them. Why? Uh, we need your help. In exchange, we'd like to try and give you your memory back. You interested? Come with me. You heard the man. [HAL]: This way, please. [] Here. Have a seat. You'll be more comfortable in a chair. Eyes forward. What are you gonna do to me? We're gonna try and remind you of who you are. [HIGH-PITCHED FEEDBACK DRONING] It's all right. Don't worry. That's just Keyboard uploading to that chip in your head. You'll see. "Project 660". What's he looking at? Let's let Mr. Gibson concentrate. "January 7th". Yes. The day they targeted you. Your car accident was no accident. The Hope Corporation canceled your medical insurance and set the whole thing up. [PHONE RINGS] [MAN ON SCREEN]: Target en route. Blue sedan. Ten seconds. Oh! Yes. Your wife, Veronica. She was in the car with you. Collateral damage. I don't remember her. We're gonna try and fix that. Let's give Mr. Gibson some privacy. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Now, I can't see what you see again. I'm sure it's overwhelming at first. Just relax into it. Keyboard will take care of you. What we're doing is we're taking you on a trip, a cyber trip, so to speak, down memory lane. [WOMAN]: Wake up, wake up. [SEVERAL PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] You see, the way we live today, we leave bits and pieces of ourselves behind in cyberspace. Traces of our lives in e-mails, blogs, MPEG files. Look, we can't really get you back your memory. But what we can do, to the best of our ability, is reconstruct a big chunk of it out of the digital footprints you've left behind. Huh? You wanna have a look at it? Yeah. Now, I'm not going to lie to you. This is gonna hurt. On more than one level. [VOICES CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [LUKE]: Damn, looking good. Turn it off. Come here, you bad boy. [LUKE]: Okay. Here I come. Hi, Luke. Um, I just got back from the doctor. So can you call me? [LUKE]: Ronnie, will you marry me? I love you, Luke. And I'm gonna remember this as the happiest day ever. And you'd better too. [RED]: He doesn't remember her. Maybe he's better off that way. With the odds he's facing, he's gonna need all the rage he can muster. - [HEART BEATING] - [EKG BEEPING] [VERONICA]: That's right, Luke. You're gonna be a daddy. [GASPING] - We don't have to go. - Oh, we're going. I love you. I know. [AMBULANCE SIRENS WAILING] Now zoom in. Hello, Miss? Are you all right? [MUFFLED SCREAMING] Not her, no. No! No! No! No! No! We had no right. We had no choice. Who murdered my wife? And my child? Can your computers tell me that? He was a freelancer working for Hope Industries. That's all we've got to go on right now. I want a name. He's angry. Yes, and that's good. It doesn't feel so good. [] [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [WOMAN OVER INTERCOM]: Downstairs door. Lewis Bodine. Answer. [LEWIS]: Virgil Kirkhill just had one of his brainstorms and called a meeting. What does he want? Just let me in and I'll tell you. Open the damn door. [WOMAN]: Downstairs door, opening. [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] We'll help you find who did this to you and why. In return, we get to see what you see, hear what you hear, hopefully gather enough data to tear down Hope Industries or at least take a big chunk out of them. What makes you think I can do this? Because you got the skills. I do? Show him. Seven years, Special Forces. Two continents. Three wars. Not only are you a decorated war hero, but eight years ago, you busted an arms-smuggling operation in your own unit. We'll be listening. If you need anything, all you have to do is ask. Keyboard can show it to you anywhere, anytime. If it's ever been online or in a computer, the boy can access it. Kind of like a superhero. A cyber-hero. Hm. Jeez, just thinking the news doesn't all have to be bad. Okay. Here's your first lead. [ANNOUNCER]: Previously on Triage Hospital: I'm sorry, Barbara. I have bad news. Oh, just tell me, doctor, am I gonna die? You have little time left. But I have a confession to make. I have feelings for you. He sells watches in those ads I keep seeing. He's a B-movie actor. We think we know where they shoot those ads. Better yet, we got you a pass. Where do I find him? [MAN]: The human brain is the most sophisticated computer the world has ever known. But like every computer, it can be upgraded. The Psi-Com Implant, the latest invention from Hope Industries, can change the way you live your life. That's great, John. I think he's really gonna love it. I hate it. I hate everything about it. Get me whatever moron is running marketing this week. Mr. Drake, the termination of Subject 373 was a disaster. Costs were 156 percent higher than the original estimate and, uh, hm, oh, yes, he got away. He had help. Yes. We have detected anomalies in the implant. Even though we can upload images, our access is severely limited. Someone is hacking into our chip and giving Mr. Gibson ideas. No doubt the same individual who's now blocking fail-safe to keep him alive. Who could do that? Somebody we thought was dead. Traxler Vukovich, known by the hacker name Keyboard. He used to work for us. There's something else. Something that always bothered me about Subject 373. He has a family. An unsuitable test subject chosen by you. Did you really think I'd never find the connection? We recruited you from prison. Gave you a chance to leave your past behind. Sir, I... I don't want excuses. I want Gibson back in our custody so we can find out how our hardware was compromised. Deal with it. Yes, sir. [] Hal found us in college, me and my brother. They call me Punk Red. Let me guess, your brother's Punk Blue? Yep. We were at this anti-corporate rally and, uh, Blue made this really lame speech. But Hal found us, uh, at the bar after and he sort of recruited us, I guess you could say. What's Hal's deal? He's a pure soul. He thinks corporations are the new superpowers. He hates them all equally. Except Hope. He hates them more. Oh, this is it. Here's the building. [] Can you guys hear me? Loud and clear. Here come the specs. [COMPUTERS BEEPING] You getting it? Coming through. No alarm. One rent-a-cop. [BLUE]: The card should get you through without ever seeing him. Copy that. Hey. You sure you don't want me to come with? Just keep the motor running. [CONSOLE BEEPING] [] [MAN]: No, no, no, no. Diction. That's all I meant, okay? Diction, okay? Ready. And action. Hi, I'm Carter Burke. And if you too are a proud owner of the new Aeon 3, you might consider... Cut. Cut, cut. I can't work like this. What's the matter now? There's someone in my eyeline. Wow, look at this. You're Aeon 3. Hey. I'm not a product. I'm an actor. Who are you? [MAN]: What's going on down there? Hi, I'm Carter Burke. And if you too are a man of class, a man of distinction, a man who values quality above all else, you need the Aeon 3. The world's newest and most technologically-advanced... That felt great. Oh, God. Oh, no. Security. Get security up here now. [DOOR OPENS] You work for Hope Industries? No. How about you? Never heard of it. Yeah, right. Sit. Blue. [BLUE]: Already on it. [CAMERA CLICKING] Here you go. All right, Mr. Arnold Winston, let's go. Luke, heads up. That wasn't very nice. [BEEPING] Oh, man. They must have just installed that. How much time has he got? [TYPING] You got two minutes. No. Relax. Show him a minute and a half. He needs to focus. It's your lucky day. Come on, you. Hurry up. [SHUDDERING] Move. Who are you? That's what you're here to help me figure out. You're one of the 660. What did you just say? Please don't hurt me. What's 660? Project 660. You're one of the test subjects. You mean to tell me there's 660 people with this thing in their head? Yes. [BEEPING] Move. [SIREN WAILING] Come on. Please, what do you want from me? Who's in charge of the program? I don't know. I swear. I'm just an account exec. That kind of information's way above my pay grade. But I know who killed your wife. I know who killed her. If I tell you his name, you'll let me go, right? [SIRENS APPROACHING] Get in. They made it. You were right. He is good. Yes. Now let's find out what Mr. Winston knows. [LUKE]: Here's your stop. No. Please. Not here. I've told you what you wanted to know. Money. You got something for me? Yo, man, he's got a wallet. Give me your money, man. Come back here. I need an address on a Robert Drake. [BLUE]: Copy that. So when we get his address, then what? Then I'm gonna pay him a visit. Is that it? Is that all this is about for you? There's a bigger picture here. There's 659 other people going through what you're going through. You have to help them. [] There's something I didn't tell you about Hal. Keyboard's his son. That's why this is so important to him. His son, just lying there. Don't you feel for him? I can't feel anything. My wife is dead and I don't even remember her. All I have left is rage. [BLUE]: Got him. Here you go. "170 Westview Drive". You know, it's a lot bigger than this Drake guy. You have every right to hate him, but you... [SIGHS] I hope it makes you feel better. That would be nice. [] [MAN]: Delivery for 112. [WOMAN ON PA]: Come on up. [DOOR BUZZES] Blue, I got an idea. [WOMAN]: Good morning, sir. Downstairs door, Lewis Bodine. [SIGHS] Answer. Virgil Kirkhill just had one of his brainstorms and called a meeting. Doesn't that bastard ever need sleep? Just let me in and I'll tell you. [SIGHS] Open the damn door. Wow. That actually worked. Our man is in the building. He's not our anything. He wants to kill this guy and then it's over. You said he'd need all the rage he could get. Well, now that's all he's got. I guess we were just using him. Like Hope was using him. No difference. Oh, there's a big difference. It's in our motives. For us, it's a question of morality, of freedom. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe he'll keep going after this. Yeah, I doubt. No, no, come on. Let's have a look. Let's do it. You see? There he goes. [STEAM WHISTLING] [DOORBELL RINGS] Door. So, what's Kirkhill want this time? Hello, Luke. Been a long time. If it wasn't me that got your mind wiped, I'd be offended. I picked you as one of the 660. You didn't fit the profile. I picked you anyway. Personal reasons. Still nothing? [SCOFFS] You don't remember the war. All those weapons left to rot in the desert. We could have been rich. [SLURPS] After the shit I went through... But oh, no, you... You had to act the hero, get the medals. Most mornings, I can still smell the phosphorous burning my face. You killed my wife. What about my wife? Lydia? Does it ring any bells? She left me when I went to prison. You ruined my life. You deleted mine. Gun. [] You shouldn't have come. [GASPING] Oh, but I'm glad you did. Ah. He's getting clobbered. Oh, God. What happened to his gun? This place has a home-defense system I've never seen before. Maybe it's online. See if you can find it and deactivate it. [RED]: Oh, no. [SIZZLING] [SCREAMS] Take it from me, this is gonna hurt. [GRUNTS] That's how we roll. Now, kill the defense system. Gun. Gun. Gun. WOMAN: Defense system off-line. Who's responsible for Project 660? [PANTING] His name is Virgil Kirkhill. He's Randolph Hope's right-hand man. And this is his way of telling me I'm fired. You have no idea how powerful these people are. See, I'm... I'm betting that they led you right here. No. That's bullshit. Maybe. Let's find out. Son? Oh, my God. You see, they... They can't just fire me. I know too much, so they're using you to kill me. [BLUE]: Luke, you got Hope troopers in the building. Oh, it's really true. They did tap into your head. Let me guess. They're telling you all about the Hope Security they're sending up here. So are you gonna do it? Or let them handle your dirty work? It's over. I've had enough killing. I lost my wife, my child. [GUNSHOT] Uh-uh-uh. I wouldn't, Mr. Gibson. My orders are to bring you in. No one said in what condition. Sir, Subject 373 is secure. [] We got played. Game over. It's the end of the line. Start packing up. - He won't give us up. - He won't have a choice. They'll torture him or trick him. He's a good man. Was a good man. Now, let it go. [GROANING] [BENNETT]: You too, huh? Yeah, they're rounding up the troublemakers. I got caught trying to go to the media. I was sold out. Man, Hope pulled all the strings. Where are we? Secret research facility, something. Nobody's ever gonna find us here. What are they gonna do to us? Open up our heads like tin cans. Try to get their hardware back. Find out how it got hacked. [SIGHS] You got hacked too? Yeah. Little Chinese girl, barely 15, computer genius. Told me to meet her on... On the corner of 14th and 9th. Sent these instructions. Like floating words. Yeah. Yeah. And it freaked me out at first. But really, she was just trying to help. Yeah, same as me. What about you? Who got to you? They called him Keyboard. In this derelict building on McDonald. Like, you mean by the park? Yeah, I think. I don't know. What do you care? Because it's my job. You all wake up knowing nobody, but still having to trust somebody. [GRUNTS] Hey. That's how this works. [AUTOMATED VOICE]: Avatar program complete. Hey! No! [] Okay, we got it. That's a wrap. [AUTOMATED VOICE]: Avatar-system shutdown initiated. - [KIRKHILL]: Mr. Jackson. - Yes, sir. Good work. Thank you, sir. [] [BEEPING] [BEEPS] Red. This is Keyboard's program for hacking the implant inside Gibson's head. This... This is every other hack my son has ever pulled. It's his lifework. Keep it safe. What about you guys? He can't run and I'm not leaving him. Blue. Keep Keyboard's files safe. All right? Or otherwise, everything we've ever worked for was for nothing. Mm-hm? [CHUCKLES] What, you're not coming? No. Come on now, get out of here. Go on, go on, go on. You, uh... Ahem, just take care of yourself, all right? Mwah. [DOOR CLOSES] [KIRKHILL]: Welcome, Mr. Gibson. I'm sorry, there's just no more space. We crammed advertising everywhere you can imagine and reached a saturation point. So we had to create a new space. A space beyond imagination. A space inside people's minds. You're insane. Who's gonna willingly let you put this thing in their head? To those who can afford it, we'll sell the implant like it's an upgrade for their mind. The ultimate personal computer in their heads, programmed to cater to every need in their empty lives. Think about instant information. Computing and analysis at the speed of thought. For the less fortunate, say, the billions without health insurance, we'll pay for their operations, their treatments, their aches and their pains. And they get the implant at the same time. It's a win-win really. We'll tell them what they want, and we'll tell them where to buy it. Then we'll sell the ad space we create in their heads, for trillions. [LAUGHING] You find this amusing? Look at me, man. This thing don't work so good. We're still working out the bugs. Project 660 is merely the test phase, the implant in your head, a prototype. There were 372 perfectly viable test subjects before you. Everything went according to plan, then you came along, complicated matters. Of course, it wasn't entirely your fault. Don't worry. We're taking care of your friends as we speak. They can't help you here. You see, we found the one way to block their signal. A few years ago, all our computer systems were infected with a virus. The Xenogen virus. It was a parting gift from a former employee. I believe you know him as Keyboard. An incredible code. An amazing virus. We kept it. Unfortunately, the only way we've found to break Keyboard's hold on the implant in your head is with his own code. The very same Xenogen virus. [VOICES]: Which is being uploaded into your brain as we speak. You may be experiencing a little discomfort. [GRUNTING] All right, now wipe the drives clean. [TYPING] [BEEPING] It's time. I won't be long behind you. This is hard. I love you too. Freeze. Step away from the boy. Step away from the boy, now. Without him, you have nothing. [AIR HISSES] [GASPS] [GUNFIRE] [EKG FLATLINING] [] We've got two more hostiles at large: one male, one female. [MAN OVER RADIO]: We don't have a visual. I need a sat uplink right now. - [HIGH-PITCHED FEEDBACK DRONES] - [BURKE]: You need the Aeon 3, the world's newest and most technologically advanced... Flavors for you to enjoy. There's... I love a man who knows what he wants. But if what he wants is Wild Times whiskey... [EXHALES] [LUKE YELLING] [] You sure we should stop? You get a better signal if we're stationary. Red, maybe... We're not abandoning him, okay? We have to try. Go. You think this'll hold? I mean, this is a Keyboard special. These crappy little machines... Just shut up and get it working, okay? Yes, sir. [BEEPS] I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm terrified. Inform Mr. Kirkhill we have a problem. They wiped the network. I'm trying to retrieve the data. No, wait. [BEEPING] Clear out! Clear the building! [HIGH-PITCHED FEEDBACK DRONING] [GROANING] ...for you to enjoy. Have you heard...? [GRUNTING] Sir, we have a problem. Stop the upload. [AUTOMATED VOICE]: Aborting upload in three, two, one. Abort. If they wiped their hard drives, we'll need his implant to find how they hacked in. Prepare for surgery. Yes, sir. [BLUE]: Here we go. Got him. [RED]: Oh, God. Hal and Keyboard wiped their drives, so now they gotta get that implant out of his head. [TYPING] That'll kill him. Okay. We have to help him. [DEVICE SNAPS INTO DRIVE] [COMPUTER BEEPS] It's not working. Hold on. There's something else. Happy birthday, mi amore. I wanted you to wake up and find this. I'm sorry that I had to work early this morning. But I promise I'll make it up to you tonight. [GIGGLING] And... I think someone else wants to say happy birthday to you too. [COMPUTER ZAPS OFF] [] They're gonna cut him open. Come on. Well, I don't know. He's not responding. Okay. Damn it. What are you doing? [DOCTOR]: Don't shoot. Yes! Nice. [BLUE]: Switching to bird's-eye view. Okay. Oh, where's he gonna go? Damn it. It's a goddamn maze down there. [TYPING] Oh, no. Here they come. [] [GUNSHOTS] [BEEPING] You're not helping him. You're just messing him up. I'm... Wait a minute. What? Those new cameras, they've got options. Watch this. [RAPID BEEPING] [ELECTRICITY POWERING DOWN] - [MAN 1]: He killed the power. - [MAN 2]: He hit one of the relays. Vault D. Wicker, go to Simon. Okay. Wow, that's good. All right. Now let's get the guards' positions. Triangulate with the closed-circuit cameras. And I'll make him a map. You can do that? What do you think? Keyboard had a hack for everything. We gotta show him where to shoot. [BEEPING] - [MAN 1]: I got him. - [MAN 2]: Ten-fourteen. Fire... [MAN 1]: He's in D21, moving north. All teams. Alpha team flying in. Delta team flying in. Alpha team, hit northeast quadrant. - [MAN 1]: Move in. Move in. - [MAN 2]: We've got him surrounded. [MAN 1]: Cease fire. Cease fire. You're hitting friendly. Hold your fire! Hold your fire! [PANTING] Thank you. Now, where do I go? Let's show him the way. I don't know how much more I can take. Who did this to us? Man, last time you asked that, your melon damn near split open. We need to go to the cops, the media, somebody. Who would believe us? We're nobody. How did you get in here? Whoa, no... What? What are you talking about? Take it easy, Luke. Luke? Who's Luke? I was just doing my job. Put down the gun, please. You're freaking me out, man. Who the hell are you talking to? You've gotta believe me. It was nothing personal. Neither is this. Get another gig. Hi, my name is Carter Burke. [SIZZLES] Time to tell the lab rats the truth. Now! [MAN]: Project 660 has the potential to increase profits for Hope Industries at an annual growth rate of 831 percent. The Psi-Com Implant interfaces with the optical and auditory sensors of the brain. Downloads are experienced by the subject as both visual and auditory stimuli, and can be repeated until the subject acts upon them. In this case, buying whatever product is being sold. The implant is also equipped with its own receptors and controls, notably a fail-safe mechanism. Should the subject transgress the boundaries of the experimental environment, the mechanism can be used to modify his behavior. Or in extreme cases, the fail-safe mechanism can be used to terminate the experiment. [AUTOMATED VOICE]: Initiating avatar program, level two. Do you think you've won? Think you've stopped us? Do you think telling the truth to 660 lost souls is enough to bring down all of Hope Industries? Do you really think Randolph Hope is going to spend one minute in jail? Tomorrow, Hope Industries will still be the largest shareholder in the company you call America. Confusing, isn't it? But one of us is real. Of course, you have to figure out which one before I kill you. [CHUCKLING] Now, Luke, your wife wouldn't want you to be a murderer. Here I am. [LAUGHING] Oh, isn't that sweet? They're still trying to help you. But they can't. [LAUGHING] Go infrared. Well, it's been fun. Goodbye, Mr. Gibson. [GRUNTS] [AUTOMATED VOICE]: Avatar-system shutdown initiated. [MACHINERY POWERING DOWN] [] [BEEPING] What's he doing? I don't know. [BLUE]: What the hell? Look at this. I love you, Luke. And I'm gonna remember this as the happiest day ever. And you'd better too. [GIGGLES] I remember you. Ronnie. Ronnie. Ronnie. [SIGHS] [] [LUKE]: Virgil Kirkhill was right. We didn't bring down Hope Industries. But we're the crack in the wall, and we keep chipping away. Randolph Hope still wields a lot of power, but we know how to stay under the radar. And if you've ever been on the grid, we can track you down. There's work to be done, hard work. I have people to protect and wrongs to set right. He's looking for us, but we found him first. My name is Luke Gibson. They stole my past, but I'm taking back my future. [VOICE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [] []
