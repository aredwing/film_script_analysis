Personal Files May 1943, Moscow, Kuncewo, Stalin's villa - Colonel Arsentiev.Hello,Hello, Yes? Can I come in? - Good morning, Comrade Arsentiev. - Hello, Comrade Supreme Commander. Come in, come. Come here, come on. All my life I dreamed of learning to play... This piano was a gift from the Spanish communists. Zhdanov played on it, they liked him, ... but Zhdanov Zhdanov ... and you are a professional musician, try it and tell me if this is a good instrument. Try, try. It's a great instrument Comrade Stalin. It plays very nicely. - What should I play? - Just play what you want. But ... I have not played in several years. I think you still play better than me. Play. The music is beautiful. Tell me, please, comrade Arsentiev what do you know about the fate of Division Commander Kotov? Comrade Stalin, the former Division Commander Kotov in accordance with the order of 24 June 1941 was executed on 25 June of the same year, at prison camp 5764, because of ongoing fighting in that territory. According to our information Kotov was not shot in '41. Why did you stop? Please, play. We received a note with the Minutes of a Special Meeting on April 27, 1941. According to this note, the Article was changed from a political crime. This document was found with the dead commander of the camp. It is interesting, this document shows, that the matter concerning Kotov at a special council meeting on 25 June 1941 There was no mention of such an event. - Did you know anything about this document? - I did not know. - Comrade Stalin ... - No, no, play on, it's just talk, play, play. Yes ... how nice it sounds when you play the music. - That is to say that you didn't know about it? - I did not know. Well ... Lavrenty? Where was this document? And what about the family? But you knew his family, Comrade Arsentiev, eh? Yes. - That is ... I lived in his house ... - Sit, Sit. Sit ... and play. I lived in the house of Professor Sierpickiego, learned from his music. Now we know ... But we are interested in Kotov's wife and daughter. not his in-laws. According to documents Kotov's wife and daughter died in a camp for members of families of traitors. And it was true? - Indeed, Comrade Stalin ... - Quiet, quiet, quiet, Lavrenty, well, what have you! That's it. And you play, play. As far as we know...That's it. you had a personal relationship? - Maybe ... quite personal. - Yes, yes, yes. That's understandable. That was good ...to know, and besides, It seems you made the arrest. I remember? Well, do you remember, Comrade Stalin? Well ... Comrade Arsentiev, Damn right I do. It seems that the Kotovs can not be considered dead. No, Comrade Stalin. You need to fix your errors ... That is my opinion. Yes, Comrade Stalin. - Comrade Arsentiev ... - Yes? In the waiting room, there is a briefcase with documents and instructions. Please address this accordingly. - Leave me. - Yes. - By the way, Comrade Arsentiev ... - Yes, Comrade Stalin? Tell me what ... do you think of Divisional Commander Kotov? Comrade Stalin, do you want to know my opinion as a Chekist, or a man? Man and Chekist are two different concepts? Do you hear, Lavrenty? So how? Comrade Arsentiev, here is the key. Please sign here. Thank you. Welcome to the briefing. Pioneer Camp Pavlik Morozov JUNE 1941 Nadia Arsentiev and I, in the team room, took in a businesslike discussion on the topic: "Is it that Pioneer-Komsomolets, and even more, Pioneer-teams, must respect the decision of the Soviet authorities, even if it is directed against the physical Pioneer or Komsomol parents? Nadia Arsentieva said that parents are always parents and you should respect them and love them, regardless of the authority. I opposed this. I said that parent-traitors deserve a full and absolute Pioneer or Komsomol contempt. Pioneer or Komsomolets, and even more Pioneer-team, into the ranks of ... Pioneering or Komsomol organizations, have only one parent: the Soviet homeland and the Bolshevik party. Excuse me ... but why am I reading this to you? Thank you. Continue, continue, though, what have you said to this Nadia Arsentieva? Then Nadia Arsentieva told me I really call her Nadia Kotov a daughter of a convicted enemy of the nation, former Division Commander Kotov needed to renounce him during the ceremonial speech on her acceptance into the ranks of the Communist Youth Union. That's it? Everything. Even the date and signature: - Luba Kawko. You're very brave, Luba Kavko. Luba ... and your father? Dad ... My biological father ... has been convicted under Article 58 Together with my mother we denounced him publicly. Now, I wear the name of his mother. Kavko. The Fabulous people. You are from an exemplary family.. Now listen to me carefully. We will make sure that Nadia Arsentieva is repremanded. - Excuse me. - You need not to worry, we will reward you. - me? - Sure. Not long and you will be Komsomol. And since you've successfully been through this trial ... we have decided to send you on a vacation ... a trip to pioneer camp "Artek"! - Really? - Sure. Here's my phone number ... call me tomorrow morning. - Luba, Luba, Luba! - Yes? I have only one request. Yes, yes, yes, do not say anything, right? I understand, comrade. 7-13-27! You are a model, Luba Kavko. I see... You like children. I do not ... I thought it was something terrible, and here ... is one. Our Nadia is a very smart girl. I felt that this mystery, that it was a secret ... That's why I called you, She's such a daredevil ... I think it's biological ... Yes, she is exemplary. Well, well, well, yes she is. Our camp is also adjacent to the sea, so It is true that at "Artek", the sand here is darker ... You are sending Kawko south, right? And Nadia stays here with us at the Baltic. The tailor ... Anatoly Semyonovich, Article 58 Article 3 and 5, 10 years without the right to correspondence. It's your brother? It's your brother? What brother, what brother, he ... this half brother, I would ... No he's an ... enemy! Comrade Arsentiev, Comrade Arsentiev, no, no ... ...is an enemy, the worst of the worst. - On your questionnaire is not a word about it. - I do not consider him a brother, so I did not write about it. The thought never occurred to me that with such a rat ... We had to write it? - Such a trifle ... - So do you think? Comrade Arsentiev, you think I did it on purpose? Intentionally? I swear. Nikitin, come to me! Nadia. What? - You are now a grown girl. - So what? And it is that adults are responsible for the acts they commit and you must think before you say or do. I'm responsible and I think. - I understand. You look like a gadabout, all of the time needing improvement. Well, go to your team. - Nadia. - What? You said your name is not Arsentieva. And told Kavko you have another name, Kotov. Anyone else? So is that why you came here? - Yeah, I said it. And what of it? - I will not say. I understand you completely You are a model of fairness, you have rules. First of all, I am not yours, I'm responsible for myself, and secondly, what ... Go to the playground! And secondly, what? Be honest and have principles, is that so wrong? No, no, I think so, too. From when you were a child , you didn't think about yourself. As though we do not? Don't you understand that your best friend wrote a denunciation about you? So, you spit on me. But tell me, do you want to spit on your mother? After all it's why... What? That I do not want to denounce ... my father? Quiet, quiet, Nadia, quietly. You are trying to expose them, right? Those that did not consider him an enemy? Exposing all the others? - Nadia, quietly. - Okay. Then let ... Let them also put me in prison. Or shoot me ... while I'm there! You are all lies, lies, and fear This way you can do anything that you want to. You come here as if nothing had happened ... Well, doesn't your father care about you, too? Do you want to harm him? How? What? Tell me how it can hurt him, After all, he is dead! He lives? Alive? What's with Nadia? She's okay. - So she did not want to come to the car? - No, she didn't want to. These are Pioneers ... and are very busy. Pioneers ... What are you .... what are you doing? Do what? What is that? There. It's only ash. Ash ... Ash ... Could it ... persuade, force ... Sergei, had he lived, would not have allowed you to do something like that. Tell me what the hell are you talking about? - Do not allow yourself... - No, no. - Had he lived, would have to be here somewhere! - Calm down, do not start. We're going. Oh, bad, bad ... 26 June 1941 year - Oh, not good ... Why are you silent? I do not understand, they changed the Article ... to theft of property? Come on, why are you afraid it's only a bumblebee. I do not like them. - And you, you're scared? - What, me? - Yes. Well ... Who you are, and who I am? I wonder what I had stolen? I guess only spurs, stirrups, and horseshoes. But I got an Article 58. I was a political prisoner, and that's the worst crime. What are you talking about? You know what awaits us now? Death awaits us. Damn ... Escaping from the camp! Now they'll shoot us. And I was only half a year ... And if we don't get shot, we'll get five more years. What do you mean, Vanya, Are you crazy? What are you even talking about, Vanya? - The war started. - What war? Where, no where? All around it's only silence, only bumblebees flying over a meadow. You know it: "If tomorrow would be war, today we are preparing for victory." Our troops are probably already in Berlin. But now what will become of me? For God's sake, you escaped from the camp! It's over. I succeeded, but, my loved ones have died in the camps, and my mom and others not will see me. And you, Vanya? What do you suggest? Turn yourself in to the authorities? But, Vanya, you would be shot as was the entire 58-Barrack shot without an investigation or court. All of them! So what? You were in the 58, and I'm from another ... You think that's okay? I, too, should be there. - you do, and I do not. - Vanya! And if it's okay that my liar grandmother promised me the bacon, then gave Kasha the cabbage? I then ... there ... no ... all your shooting. And what I could not shoot? And she tells me that I ... Oh ... you think I'm kidding, and I'm looking at grandmother and she already has porridge on his head, and cabbage ... - Who are they? - They're Germans, Vanya. Somehow, it seems that we have not captured Berlin. Everybody back! Stop crossing! Back! I said - back! I said - back! Do not panic! Get back, get back!

Why are you surprised? They've got us because it's "SMERSH". He was wounded twice, which gave me the right to write an application to transfer him from the penal company to a unit in battle. - Then why was he not moved? - Refused. - Comrade Colonel, we are there ... - I see, I see. - For what reason? - He refused. You do not want to leave, your comrades in arms. That is what motivated the refusal. And what kind of comrades in arms?

I had orders from the Division Commander to stop the enemy at this point. It didn't work out, Comrade Division Captain , we could not, Comrade Stalin. Oh, you ... 240 people, children, boys, each 183 cm tall, and German tanks and bullets squished them like caterpillars ... and in only 15 minutes! Are there anyone in the Kremlin at all who knows how to fight the Germans, and kill them? Stalin ... What? What fool told you that? You said, comrade lieutenant. What do you want? - Gentlemen, bring me something to drink. - The end is coming, soon. Water ... give me water. As soon as you pour. Go, go .. Go, go, bring more water. - Airplane! - Airplane, hide! Instructional Ivan, I'm coming, I'll be right there What's next, Captain? I have a record of the interview by SMERSH, after that and coming here, there is nothing. There's nothing special, but interrogating them. That's confidential. He sat in jail a week until he joined the new penal battalion. The composition of this battalion fought until 1942. - My wife is very fond of this song. - Tango. Tango. And yes, the truth, the tango. But you better not let him sing. - You know, the wife does not like how I sing ... - Captain, I feel that you are hiding something. No, no what you ... in 1941, tried to learn something about the fate of his daughter. - You know that he had a daughter? - Is that all? I do not care of his family situation. I heard about this on the basis of denunciation, - and yet it did not disturb him in this. - Why? He had a criminal article , that did not ban correspondence, He had the full right to address a formal request and get an official response. - What was the answer? - That his daughter is considered as lost without a trace. August 1941 Look, a well! As soon as you catch up! But it's quiet, not a living soul. Where has everybody gone? It's hot. This water's good! Cold as ice! Klaus fill my canteen. - Give me your soap? - Yes. - What is going on, Jurgen? I know nothing about it. - What is it? I know nothing about it. Now the horses belong to the Wehrmacht. Back off now! Leave me alone! - We have a license! - I do not understand. - Look, we have a license! - Oh ... you have documents! The permit to have horses. Please let us keep them, then we will sing for you. They are Gypsies. Back off from me! Why? What did you do? Why are you staring at me like that? They were looting! After all they're Gypsies! And you? Are you an SS man? And, Go to hell! I've had enough of this lunatic! - Klaus, where are you going? - I do not want to see anymore! - Otto, and you? Where are you going? - Give me a break! Please do not kill me. What? Good morning, good morning. Comrades, open up! Please, open, open! Comrades, open up! Open, comrades, open up! Hey! Otto! Otto, I have to lug all this water? Otto ... where are you? Otto ... what are you doing? Otto ... Jurgen! You're here! Otto ... where are you? It's folly to quarrel with Gypsies. Where are you? Stop joking around, guys. Pogdzmy be. Dinner is ready. Guys, let's go. Quickly, here! Quick, quick, back! Go! Come this way. Run there. There, at the top. Everybody get out! Collect them on the square! Search all the buildings! Yeah! - Look how many of them there are! - Who, Germans? No, the local population. After running around, I tapped and no one opened up. Why chase them there? They want to know who killed those Germans. What will they do to them? I think that's good. - You have to do something. - And what can you do? But they are innocent, they did not kill the Germans. And who killed them ... you? Maybe me? Sit down and shut up, okay? Shut up! Someone should answer for it. Who did it? If no one admits everyone will answer for it. Just kill them all! Listen, you exemplary Pioneer! What do you want? If I went there? I would be executed for having saved your life? I killed at least two, and they will - what will they do? Three got me... do you hear? Three of them held me down and raped me before their eyes. And they looked and just hid in the corners, like mice. And would you open the door to help a stranger? Well, tell me, would you open it, to help? What would have happened to you if it weren't for me? Tell me - did anyone open the door? Did they help you? What do you want, what do you want? For me to go down there? You want me to, right? God wants me to suffer? Because innocent suffer? Suffer for me ... so be careful. Hey! I am coming to you! Hey ... wait! Wait! Why did you stop me, after all that's what you wanted! I want to go down there, you silly girl, let me go! What ... what are they doing? Why ... What's with the water? I do not know, maybe it's gasoline. They're going to burn them? Fire! Stop it, bastards! Stop, stop! Hold on, I'm telling you, stop! - How do I continue to live! - Listen to me! You're wearing a cross, so you're a believer? - Do you believe in God? - How do I live? You are baptized, right? If you believe, please, right now is not opposed to His will, because he does not want our deaths. It is he who ... He does not want our death! Calm down, already. Be calm, calm, calm... This is not the time, it's not our time! I know, I know ... I know I know that He saved me ... That I ... found him ... ... the only thing left to me, is to find my father ... Papa. - I know, I know, I know ... - What, what? If I found my father ... my father ... Papa ... So let me live, Father ... You don't how good I feel when I am with you... Oh, is that true? Me, too. With you everything is calm... everything is easy. I love you. I do not understand, sir ... May 1943, the liberated territories Staff troop "SMERSH" I knew who he was and I knew Kotov, that was in the article. Really? - Look, stop torturing the instrument. - I knew, of course, Comrade Colonel, Why is it surprising - the Division Commander Kotov, a highly decorated war hero his image was on the candy. my wife is very fond of ... - Captain ... - Excuse me, she liked those chocolates. She was killed a week ago. Article 58 rather than a prisoner? That means that someone from the Central Machinery very carefully watched his fate. Yes, yes, yes, yes ... - No..? - Well, I understand ... but I do not question me ... again in 1941, I offered to transfer him, but he refused. In the spring of 1942, he, along with other soldiers, caught a very important German, They demonstrated bravery and courage. I was obliged to demand amnesty for him, to transfer him to the combat unit with decorations. And when he refused again, I was forced to request clarification in writing. I'll show you, Comrade Colonel. "I, Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin, I admit that ..." , Comrade Colonel, Comrade Colonel, please, this ... - Here it is. - Yes, wait ... When was it? in 1942. - Here's the explanation. - "Explaination ..." - Do you mind if I smoke? - Smoke, smoke. "I, the undersigned Kotov, a soldier who has demonstrated blah, blah, blah ... I would like to remain in the company of prisoners because, I know that my family thinks I am not alive and no one is waiting for me." Remember, my dear, remember once and for all, that you and our daughter are alive only because of me. I'll live on, provided how few people know of your existence. They think I was shot 4 years ago. You do not exist, do you hear? Nadia and Marusia Kotov do not exist. You are corpses. Only dust. - Mitienka, what are you talking about? - Like what? Finally, I'm telling you the truth! I'm telling you the truth! I think it's an excuse. ... a lie. - What, what? - A Lie. Do you have any information about the family? I did not think it was the family, but other reasons for which he remained in prison with the battalion. Think about it yourself - the Division Commander, repeatedly would check the candy ... And suddenly there was an ordinary label? No such humiliation. Penal Battalion is another matter, there tends to be those characters... The worse the better. - A total hell, you understand? - I understand. Look, the signature is his ... but the date is fuzzy. I do not remember the exact date, but it was the summer of 1942. Kotov was ordered to attack the Germans, but, he almost got away. Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hold on, I said, stop! Damn ... stand down. Lieutenant, where are we now? We are flying without instruments. There are probably still Russians below us. The plane cannot land with it attached. We can't fly to base with it. If we land behind the front, we'll be on our own. Stuck behind the lines! Do something! I'll fly in a circle. Release the clamps! - If you do not detach it, it will kill us. - What can I do? - How much fuel do we have? - Just enough to return to base! What is this? "Sergeant." Well, go, go, gotcha! "Dear Grandma! I write to you again. How are you? I hope you are fine. Our hospital has moved again, but ... " What's grandmother, what is her name? it's gonna blow! What have you done? You asshole, asshole, asshole ... It's not me! This is unbelievable! - motherfucker! - This amulet saved us! My grandmother, my grandmother gave it to me. Idiot. Do you understand what happened here? It's a miracle! Incredible. Give me your hands, gimme your hands! Tie my hands together, behind my back. If your hands are bound in front, you can easily escape. You can run away, run away without a problem! This amulet saved our lives. Do you believe in such miracles? Are there any wounded here? Are there any wounded here? Are there any wounded here? Little sister! - Help me! - I'm coming; stay there! Little sister! - Where are you? - Here! Now, now I'm coming ... Little sister! - Where are you? - Here I am! Now, now, now. Wait a minute ... right, right, right uncle ... - I will help you immediately. - What's with the uncle thing? I'm 19 years old. It's good you are 19, you have a young body. Faster recovery. As soon as you do the dressing, Just a little longer, now! - Stay quiet! - It hurts! - Hold on, Hold on! It hurts! Quiet, the Germans will hear! Hang on. Hang on. I said - stay strong. Why are you crying? Why are you crying? With all the corpses around, and you're still alive. You should be happy. Why are you crying, eh? Are you a believer ... what? Shut up, you should not say anything. - Do you know a prayer? - I know one. Tell me. O Lord, I wish to be obedient to your will. My will? ...not yours, His. Stalin? No, no, no ... I do not understand. When you grow up, you will understand. How do you get out of here? Come on ..! Easy, easy, easy. Breathe, hear, breathe! Breathe ... breathe. Look at me, look at me Can you hear me? Look at me! Open your eyes, open! You're here, you are, just give the injection. Breathe, breathe deeply, breathe. Breathe, dear, look, you will be well soon. Look what I have for you in your pocket. Look it's warm, German medicine, that will make better. Where are you from? ...Uglich. Uglich ... and what's your name? Termido ... Termido? You're not a Russian? Oh, silly. Is it not Russian? My name is Termidont. They called me so in honor of my grandfather. My dad came up with it... The old bonehead. Hush, my dear and stay still. Another moment, breathe, breathe. Breathe deeply! Hold on and stay still. Little sister ... Wait. - Wait. - What? Show ... - What do you want me to show? - Breasts. Your breasts .... show me. What? I've never seen breasts. Really. Much less, kissed them. Show me, please. Please. Come on, you will see. If I die, I will have not ever seen them. I want to see them at least once before my death. Please! Please .... only once. Show me. End of Part One I need Kotov, Captain. Where is he now? Almost a month ago I left the division, I am now occupied with other matters. and so, I do not know where Kotov is now! So tell me, where was he a month ago! - A month ago he was in the Citadel! - Where? The Citadel! It's ... That ... That nightmare was hell, a meat grinder! It was a real death factory! A month ago he was just there and it wouldn't seem to me that he survived! The Citadel 3 Burnt by the Sun On screens soon...
