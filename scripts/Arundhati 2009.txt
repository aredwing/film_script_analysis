My only daughter, I can't believe she's grown up to marry. This is nothing, he'll stun Hyderabad with the grandeur of marriage. She's apple of your eye. Brother, priest says it's time for the function to start. - Is it? Yes, dear. It's time for the function, where is Arundhati? They are getting her ready upstairs. Dear Arundhati! You are the moon... Your smile is the moonbeam... You're groomed elaborately after taking bath in clouds... Shining bright with pearl flourish... The moment festivities began... This home has become celestial Brindhavan... Your cheeks are blooming like blushing flowers... Shall we the eagerness of the wild heart in anticipation? She was with us till now to come out in open today... We were waiting for years to see this day of festivities... Grew up amongst us in the cradle of love... She grew up fondly with loving care...

Look at the beauty. whose dreams have come true... These festivities around me... It's a boon of my life... It'll become a part of my heart and keep beating... I'll never forget it all my life these moments of happiness... O Bommali! The bud has blossomed into a flower! You've grown into a woman to quench my urge. Squeezing you little by little I want to suck you up. I'll bring you to Gadwal. Fast... get ready fast, we must be in Hyderabad by 4 pm. Nothing is ready. Arundhati loves my mother Jejamma's jewels. Very lucky jewels, I must take them with me. I got it. Here! Still looking great! Why did sir scream loudly? - Don't know what happened? Let's go! Is it? - Yes, today morning... You don't worry grandma, we are coming there now. No dear, priest told you not to cross the outskirts, we'll go and bring them. I'm worried about grandpa's health, I can't follow customs now. Welcome to Gadwal! Welcome to Gadwal! I made you to enter Gadwal, I'll not let you go out from here. Are you little kid to run and jump? No, neither I ran nor jumped. - Did anyone pushed you then? I did feel like that. But there wasn't anyone near me. Why do you want to live here? Come with us to Hyderabad immediately. We too said that but he never listens. Why are you interfering? - Why are you interfering? No. - What no? Then... - What then? I've to take care of our lands, our kingdom, our people who depend on us, right? Didn't I tell you must be fine to look after them? Yes. - But then? Jejamma... - I don't take no. Leave immediately. I'll come. - Didn't I say to leave immediately? Then get going. - Yes I'm going. How old my little one may grow, he's still a child for his mother Jejamma? How are you Chadramma? - I'm fine, madam. You've come first time to your kingdom after fixing marriage. Seek Jejamma's blessings. - As you say Chandramma. Jejamma... Jejamma... our Jejamma... First girl child in the family should always have my name. Believe that I've taken birth again. Madam, you've kept the promise of coming back to this kingdom. Jejamma is not anywhere else, she's always with us. Yes, she's always with us. Come, Susheela is in the fort.. Susheela is in the fort... unable to breathe... We must get her out of it. - Tie him in the back yard. She's scared, we must get her out. Leave me... Susheela is in the fort, she's inside a grave. I must get her out. - How did Ramana become like this? Car met with an accident near our fort while bringing your marriage invitation. He's calling Susheela, what happened to his wife? Don't know what had happened to her? Haven't you given him any medical treatment? There's a fakir here to treat such disturbed and possessed patients. I'm sending Ramana to him today. Greetings Anwar bhai! - Greetings. Greetings fakir bhai! - Greetings. Come on children... take sweets... you too take dear... Fakir bhai, you're a Muslim, why are you distributing sweets near temple instead of a Durgah? Gods may be different but the hunger they created is same to everyone. One can give food to anyone anywhere where you find a hungry man. Ramanamma, you too have, eat happily, good business of coconuts. Fakir sahib, my child had a bad dream last night, and since then hasn't passed urine. Won't he if you leave him alone to sleep with your husband? Yes sir. - Wait and see. Pass urine child... pass urine... My child passed urine. Ghost left with urine, go away! Allah will protect you, Lord Hanuman will protect you. Leave me... leave me I say... leave me... I'll rip out your skin, you demon! Shut up! Who are you? I'm her lover, she refused to marry me, that's why I committed suicide by taking pesticide. Is there love story for ghosts also? Love, Allah! Come... come inside... go... go inside... go... No... I can't bear it any more... no... That's the line of protection of Allah, evil can't cross that line. This is holy temple for all but prison to ghosts like you. Shut up! Go... go into it... go... Go into that jar! He looks like a mad man. - No, he's a great man! Go! Enemy of the mankind! Karim, bury this jar in the burial ground tonight. - Yes sir. Sundaramma, take your daughter. - Okay sir. Apply kohl and make her drink holy water mixed with sacred ash. What's this, leave me? - Stop... stop... - Sir sent him. Don't laugh, Susheela is in the fort, they brought me her instead of going there. I'll also come with you. - You come with me. Let's go after warding of evil and offering prayers. No need of all that, I must go and break open the grave. You coward! - Stop it! What are you doing? Our junior madam. Is it treatment to beat black and blue? Man must get rid of possessed ghosts to live peacefully. The stick must be tight to make the ghost leave him, do you think I beat others for fun? Do you still believe in ghosts? Do you believe in God? - I believe, so what? Then, you must believe there are ghosts. Then, show me a ghost. Is it paining? - Yes sir. He said it's paining, show me his pain. Show me the air! Show me your life! What is not seen isn't unreal and what is seen isn't always real. Does your holy Koran says it? Even holy Geeta too says it. If your holy thread is real, then amulet I give is also real, if the coconut you break is true, then the lemon I tie is also real, If this is real before God, then this is real for ghosts. Stop it! Why are you beating a mentally unstable man black and blue? He's in very danger. - Only if he's here. Madam, he's not in danger but you! There's a danger lurking around you. Trying to make me believe you? But I'm telling you the truth. - You can't cheat me. Go away... go away immediately from this place. If he's so insisting, I think he has a reason. You keep quiet. - No madam. You keep quiet Chandramma. Let's take him. Thinking about you, waiting for you, a soul here is yearning for you. Come quickly and relieve me from this sorrow of separation. How? I'm not in Hyderabad, right? - I'm also in Gadwal. Gadwal? Do you know what's the time now? Midnight 12, unable to reach your house in this darkness, there's an old fort on the outskirts, I'm waiting there for you. You stay there, I'll come in 10 minutes. Where are you going madam? I'm going out and will be back in 10 minutes. Why did you come here, madam? Please go away, madam. Rahul is inside. - There are no humans inside. Don't go, madam. - That's my Rahul's whistle. - Madam! Where are you Rahul? Where is he? May I sing... the song of sorrow... Come dear! Come upstairs! He's in upstairs, he's waiting for you only. Come dear... come... Come... Come... Arundhati, here! I've been waiting for long time for you in this room. When I hear your voice, memories of all that you've done is coming back. I'm unable to tolerate seeing you so near. Come... come nearer to me. Every passing moment is making me go mad. Come... come... if you don't then you'll die! You can't harm me! Arundhati, I'll kill you. You can never come out of that grave. I'll come out. - I'll not let you come out. I'll chase you... chase you... I'll offer your life as sacrifice. I'll come to show you hell. Hey Bommali! I'll not leave you! Madam... Leave my hand. - What are you doing, madam? Didn't I tell you to leave this town? Why did you come to this place? That demon called you here to kill you. What that nonsense you're saying? Rahul is inside. - No, there's no one inside. He's there inside. - No! No! Nobody's in there! No... no... nobody. I came here after getting a phone call. Call him on phone and know where he is. How long should I've to wait for you? This man here is creating nuisance here. Where are you now? - I'm in Vijayawada now. Vijayawada? The phone call you got is real, you answering that call is real, but it's not real that Rahul is here. What you see with your eyes is not always real, madam, there's an evil empire of ghosts and demons in the air around us. You can see it in the light of almighty Allah! Understood it? Have you understood everything? Hey Bommali! I'll not leave you! I'll come for you. Go away from this town. Go away! Please go away, madam. There are no humans inside. Who is he? My elder brother Veerendra Varma. He died 30 years ago. People say he's seen sometimes near that fort. It's their imagination. How can they see him? Where are you now? - I'm in Vijayawada now. Go away! - Hey Bommali! I'll not leave you! What's it madam? I want all the details about our fort. Please, tell me Chandramma. Why are you asking about it? No, madam. Please don't think about it. What's the story behind that fort? It's not a story, it's a bad dream. A bad dream you never want to think about again. Please tell me about it. You're asking the story about yourself. Your own story! That's not a fort, it's Gadwal kingdom. Epitome of valour and pride. With smiles of children, affection and love, our kingdom was filled with happiness and festivities. Your great, great grandfather Raja Chinnavenkata Rangarauyudu was king He had 2 daughters, Queen died when they were children. Elder daughter was Bhargavi, she was beautiful and very innocent, she never went against father's word. Younger daughter was Arundhati, a ferocious tigress of the empire, Nobody could challenge her in sword fighting or in archery. She was born with leadership qualities. The valour and confidence in her eyes, and the courage, she appeared like Gadwal's presiding deity Goddess Jejamma. That's why everyone called her as Jejamma. Like in every story there will be a villain, this story too has a villain. Hey Bommali! - Leave me... He was a sex maniac! Never left any woman he liked. He used to chase like them like a pack of hungry jackals. He was King's nephew Pasupathi. Pasupathi? Leave me... leave me... He used to kill anyone opposing him. He was a man in appearance but a beast in character. King's biggest mistake was to get Bhargavi married to him. His scheming mother Jalajamma was behind all this. King's sister. She cheated King by saying that their horoscopes matched perfectly, and got her son married to his elder daughter Bhargavi. What's this, hubby? Is it good on your part to bring these cheap women to home? If they are cheap women, then you too are cheap. Come... come Bommali... - Leave me. This is quite common in royal families, why are you making it an issue? Go away! That innocent girl's life got ruined by the duo of mother and son. One fine day, they went further down. Arundhati was learning a special dance from a Varanasi danseuse, She was blind. Look Arundhati, today I'm going to teach you a new dance. Royal women, especially future queens like you, must learn this dance. Like in archery, aiming target listening to sound, this is known as Dance of sound. You make the sound, watch how I respond with echoes my dance moves. Okay madam. Even if it's a heart beat, I'll hit the bulls eye. Junior madam, King is calling you. Okay, you go, I'll come. He came like a hungry beast fully drunk with desires. Fresh smell! I shudder even today when I think of what he did that day. I'll come to take you, I'll do what I came here for. Come Arundhati! I'm going to teach you the dance of Pranava Bhairava. If you do this dance before an enemy in an helpless situation, you can save yourself. Who is it? Arundhati? Why don't you answer me? Who is it? Who is it? You came here to teach dance of valour. I came to you to learn the dance of love. Leave me! Come here! Arundhati, madam Kanchana is not well, she left just now promising to come tomorrow. You're very lucky, Bommali. You're dying while enjoying sex. You fulfilled my sex desire even as you die. You're banished from this kingdom. You came here after bringing bad name to your In-laws. Nobody can tolerate if you son ruins the honour of this royal family. Be careful! You mustn't forgive a man who did this grievous crime. Father, banish them from here immediately. I'm not tolerating him because he's my son-in-law, your sister's life is in his hands. If she's not married to him, my one order is enough for my subjects to lynch him. Come, do we look like mad? Why are your people angry on me and my mother? Do they think we are useless? I'll kill you. No son! Listen to me. - Leave my hand. Leave it, don't rush. She must be alive till you become the heir to this kingdom. Only then you can next king as son-in-law. That's why I got her married to you. If she dies, we'll not have any place in this royal family. They will hunt us down to death, remember that. your sister's life is in his hands. If she dies, we'll not have any place in this royal family. If she's not married to him, my one order is enough for my subjects to lynch him. If she dies, we'll not have any place in this royal family. my one order is enough for my subjects to lynch him. ...we'll not have any place in this royal family. Madam Bhargavi! My dear Bhargavi! There's no beauty or fun in the home with a dead body. How long will you keep the body of one who committed suicide? Throw it away! This is your end! Leave my son... don't beat my son. Leave him... don't kill him... leave him... Throw her away! Leave him... leave him... don't beat him! His gory death must scare any man even to think of other woman. Not only him but even after his death, even dogs must hate to see his body. Tie this womanizer to his own wild horse. This is your end! You must meet a dusty end! Drag him away! That day Arundhati not only chased out a cruel man but his lawlessness, His arrogance! His violence! Ever since then people considered Arundhati as Goddess Jejamma. Called her as Jejamma! She grew up and was darling of everyone. she became a saviour Goddess. You're the light of hope in the tunnel of the darkness... You're Goddess Kali with the sword... Your ferocious look is enough to make enemy's sword to shiver... When you paint. it's a mirror image of your heart... You're Goddess Annapurna who feeds everyone... You're mother earth in looking after her children... When you say it's a holy hymn... When you do something. it's an irrevocable law... You're patient like mother earth... You're an epitome of justice... This is my kingdom. be careful! Jejamma... our mother... O Jejamma... Jejamma's words were edicts to her subjects. People lived happily under her rule. But Pasupathi didn't die as people thought. His vengeance on Arundhati kept him alive. Some people passing that way saved his life. They were Agoras! They lived with dead souls, ghosts and demons. They were sorcerers and offered prayers with dead bodies. They took lives using evil souls. This is your end! He studied art of Tantric from Agoras to take revenge on Arundhati. He took lives using tantricism by cruel methods of witchcraft. He offered prayers with dead bodies. He drank human blood. Doing many such inhuman and disgusting things, at last he achieved many evil powers. He's not a human any more. He's a tantric with many evil souls dwelling in his body. He entered Gadwal again to take revenge on Arundhati. Bad luck, Arundhati got married on that day's morning, Entire Gadwal was celebrating the event. Kill him! even dogs must hate to see his body. Who are you? Alms are given outside not inside. Go and stand outside. Who am I? Close all the 8 directions! Who am I? Who am I? Pasupathi! Leader of Agoras! No madam, that evil man is endowed with great power. Nobody can go against him, no weapon can kill him. It's very dangerous to challenge him now. His tongue commands death! His hands take lives. It's very dangerous to face him now. Never take a back step with cowardice on facing danger. Even if it's death, face it! Arundhati, I'll not leave you, I'll not leave anyone in your family. I'll decimate everyone. With whom you got me beaten up, come out into open I say! Arundhati... Why did you come out, dear? Arundhati?! What a stunning beauty! The bud has blossomed! I came here to shred you into pieces. But I'll not kill you. I've been living for 7 years without touching a woman, I didn't expect meeting such a ravishing beauty. A woman considers chastity more than her life, right? So I'll malign your honour first, then I'll take your life, bury you in the middle of your home, and offer your soul to my evil God. O debauch! Waves of echoes... Beat of deadly percussion... My inner soul... Waves of revenge are lashing and dancing with vengeance... I don't want song. Bommali! May I sing the song of sorrow... May I perform dance of death... When darkness is enveloping from all sides... In the raging fires of slavery and harems... Inauspicious time has set in... Ill fortune followed it... Death is chasing... Life span is diminishing... This agony will end with my death only... The agony isn't yours. it's mine. You made my life miserable by tying me to my horse. Right now as you watch I'll make her life go the dogs. The real game begins at upstairs only. Anyway you've fixed time for the honeymoon. happiness will be mine. opportunity is mine. losing honour is yours. Lord Brahma himself can't change the fate he writes... If you deviate from the righteous path. God will punish you... You can never challenge and win against your fate. you better know it... Demon Ravana died for desiring Goddess Seetha... Evil desires never get fulfilled... Playing with honour of women is danger to you... As a woman I'm singing... your end of life... Evil will perish... 8 hands of Goddess Durga will cut you to size... As a woman's rage turns into a raging wild fire... Raging fires of the womanhood is seeking a sacrifice... Your ghastly death... Ghastly death to me? No way! Death fears me! It'll run away! I'll offer your life to it. O Bommali! Make your anklets clang in rhyme with the music of my shells. That day when I enjoyed sex with your dance teacher, getting angry you kicked me. Today I must enjoy you with every cell in my body. Bommali! Come on dance! These clothes will become daggers! Cut the tongue of a tantric who recites evil hymns. Tie his hands! Strangle his neck! Only then you can confine him. No... no madam... don't rush! Don't kill him. If you kill him, he'll become a powerful evil soul. You mean...? He's now with an unfulfilled desire of taking revenge on you. According to our scriptures, anyone who dies with unfulfilled desires will not leave this world. It'll take revenge. If an evil Agoras like him dies, he'll become a mighty evil power. But if I spare him, he'll let anyone to live. You're right madam, but there's no solution to his problem. If so then I'll not kill him, I'll bury him alive right now here. I'll imprison him so that even his soul will not come out of it. I'll use every Godly power on earth to make his grave. I'll ensure that his soul never comes out of that grave But if anyone breaks open his grave, his evil soul will bring only destruction. It will destroy you and your kingdom. It mustn't happen at any cost. Nobody will enter this fort after burying him in his grave. Dig his grave! That evil man shivered in fear hearing madam's decision. Bringing stones from different holy places, Jejamma started building an impregnable grave. The evil beast was crying ferociously in his grave. The fort shuddered for his loud cries. You must die going through hell with nerves getting cut. She got ready powerful amulets. She got them nailed to the walls and made it air tight. She invited every Vedic scholar in the kingdom. She arranged Chandi and Rudra sacrifices. That evil soul's cries got buried in the holy chants of hymns. Lord Shiva's tridents which protect the world, Jejamma got them fixed around his grave so that he'll never come out. At that moment she appeared like Goddess Kali who came to save us. After that we never entered the fort. That fort too got dilapidated along with that grave. That brought an end to his atrocities. No! I'll not leave you. No, it didn't end. Really, Jejamma did a great thing. Yes, but burying him alive that day disturbed her life. After that...? - After that...?... After that... there's so much to say about her... we are getting late, you go to sleep now. Go, don't think about it. Sleep peacefully. What happened after 48 days, Chandramma? That is... that is... Jejamma and I only know it. Tell me, I must know it. I need to know it. Heard a cry from that fort, it was his outcry! come... I'm your brother-in-law Pasupathi. I'm hungry. Thirsty, I'm dying with thirst. Release me, break open this grave. I'm dying... Come... do you know this? Do you know I died 3 days ago? You're talking to my soul! I died a painful agonizing death because of you. My body has decayed, it's stinking with worms. I'll not leave you... not leave you... I'll not let anyone in your family to live. But a woman! I'll make you cry aloud plunging you into deep pain of sorrow. I'll have you like a dog. I'll cut you like a goat. I'll not leave you, Bommali! Come! - He's right there! Still... Release me. - I'm coming. He mustn't come out at any cost. I'll come this night, this moment for you. Break me free! Come... come... - Hit with power! He must remain in the grave forever. Break yourself free. He mustn't come out at any cost. I'll come, I'll definitely come. Pull it... pull it with all your strength. Pull it... Pull it... pull it... pull it... Susheela, I'm coming! - Come! Susheela, I'm coming! - Come! Susheela, I'm coming! - Come and free me. Don't come, go away! Don't come, go away! Go away! Allah the great! I've come... I'll break open the grave. I'll free you out. Goddess Jejamma, everyone say I'm your reincarnation. But I'm not as brave as you. You're a great woman to bury such an evil man. But why is he still in that grave? Come... - I've come. Come to me... By chance if he comes out, can I face him bravely like you? No, I'm not Jejamma! He can't come out. Here! Here! Hit... break it open! Hit! Hit! He can't come out of the grave. He can't come out. Break it open! Hit... hit... hit hard... Freedom... Son... freedom to my son... My son is getting freed. Freedom... freedom... My son is getting freed. Will you stay back there only? When are you coming back? Are you hearing me or not? I came to know many new things about my family. - What is it? It seems many years ago there lived a sadist in my family, Everyone fear him. But he fears Jejamma. It seems Jejamma punished him severely for his atrocities. I hate even to think about him. He is... - Pasupathi, master of Agoras. Rahul, I'll call you later. - But Aru... You made a grave mistake. It was your grave mistake of burying me alive. Not 10 or 20 years, I was decaying in that grave for 80 years. I was raging with revenge. After years I've come out! I've come out. Same fragrance! From this moment no more smile in your life. You'll worry to live, and wish to die but can't. You'll not know what's happening ... death! What's it madam? Did you enter my room a little while ago? No madam, I brought your milk, may I add sugar? No need. You can go now. - Okay madam. No, this is not true. He's... not here! My neck... it's my dream... ... dream... He's not here! He is... What happened? Nothing, when are we going to Hyderabad? Tomorrow evening. - No, we are leaving by morning. What happened? Don't ask me anything. We must leave before tomorrow's dawn. He's here only, what should I do now? Madam, he's not in danger but you! There's a danger lurking around you. I must meet Anwar at any cost now. He's not here. - No there? He went to Banganapalli yesterday. When will he come back. - Don't know madam. I must meet him immediately. Come. No madam, it'll take 4 hours by car, short cut will take 30 minutes only. I'll go immediately. - Go, don't delay. I'll come fast, immediately. You mustn't get help from anyone. I'll not let it happen, don't try. This earth and air is hell to you. Go... go away from Gadwal! Oh God! It's madam! Train is approaching. Madam, start the car! Oh! I don't find anything near! Bommali! I didn't bring you here to let you go back. Don't ever try to leave Gadwal again. I'll not leave you... you're confused, right? Don't you feel the noose is tightening? Don't get scared, I'll not let you die so easily. I'll not let you die, Bommali! Madam, get ready quickly. Where? - Asking me where, Manga? We must go to madam's marriage, right? - Marriage? Go, marriage is cancelled. We are ready to leave. You too come down quickly. You mustn't go, only they must go. You must send them. You mustn't tell them anything. You wait outside, I'll bring her. - Come. They will also meet the same end, ask them to leave. Go! We are ready to leave... why are you looking sick? No. - Shall we leave then? You go now. What about you? I'll stay back here for 2 days and come later. I'll come leisurely. Your marriage day is fast approaching, how can you stay here? I want to take rest for 2 days. - How can you stay here alone? Come. Can't I stay here for 2 days? - Why not?- Then...? I don't like to leave her alone here. I don't need to explain anyone, I'm staying back here. You may all go. - No..? If anyone objects now, it's like killing me. - Oh no! No need to swear for silly things. Relatives will not let her stay peacefully there. She'll come leisurely. - I forgot about it. You stay here and take rest. You'll come, right? Let's go Chandramma. What's the matter, dear? You look different from yesterday. Don't think too much about that dilapidated fort. Don't think too much, dear. She'll stay here and come later, let's go now. What's you too, old man? - I'm the oldest and ordering you. No father... - What no? Asking too many questions, can't she stay here alone for few days? Come... - Come... Grandpa! - Come... May I stay back? No... no... I'll also go with them, all I want is your happiness only. Bye. Let's go. - We are. Come. Come fast, we'll be waiting for you. - Take care dear. Take care dear. - Come fast. - Bye aunt. Come fast. - Come fast, we'll be waiting for you. Kill me... kill me. I'll not kill! If I want to kill you, would've done it the moment I came out of the grave. I want to enjoy wildly your beauty and your pride, Bommali. Hey Satan! Hey I'll not leave... Don't worry dear. Leave me... - I'll not leave... not leave... Why? Why is he angry on me? Why this torture? - Revenge dear, revenge. He was buried alive, right? That's why! I didn't do it, Jejamma did it. Aren't you Jejamma? - Me? Aren't you our Arundhati madam? Don't talk rubbish, Chandramm. Don't confuse me, I'm not Jejamma. No... no... If you're not Jejamma, why is he seeking revenge on you? Why...? Because you are Jejamma! - No, it's false! If Jejamma had thought about destroying him, then she must've known the way, you're reincarnation of Jejamma, please tell us how? I'm not Jejamma, why don't you listen to me? What's these fake tales around me? Is it not true the destruction around you?- True. Is it false that he challenged to ruin your life?- True. Is it false that he came out of grave to torment you? True... it's true. Then it's true that you're Jejamma! I believe you're reincarnated Jejamma, I swear on Allah. That is not true. - Yes it is. No... no... - This is true... true... Watch out! You've kept your promise Jejamma... You've come back... Look Chandramma! Isn't she Jejamma? Yes. - Jejamma! This sword style is Jejamma's, who else's? Yes, the same royal demeanor. I feel like seeing madam, I feel like seeing Jejamma. Think... go back to past and think. Think... Forget the present. Go into the darkness of nature that defines life and death. Provoke Jejamma in you. Go into the past and think. Go... think... I feel like seeing myself. Find a lead... think... I feel like he's saying something. Think... think... think... think... This is a self portrait by Jejamma. If you read this, it means he has come out. I don't know if you know this or not but I know. That I'm reading this. This is a diary I wrote to remember what had happened. Once when he dies and becomes an evil soul, as he promised to torture me, he did exactly like that. I'll not leave you. A strange disease spread from the grave. Your subjects will get affected by contagious diseases. Even air got polluted. His curse afflicted my people and ruined their happiness. My prosperous kingdom turned into a hell with his curse. Not a drop of water to drink also. I asked him, I made a plea, fearing him nobody dared to step into Gadwal. The disease turned men to go mad and kill each other. I couldn't take it any more, I couldn't tolerate it. I left Gadwal thinking of finding a way to finish him. I went to many places. I met many great Yogis and Tantrics. I read many epics and scriptures. I met many scholars and saints. Nobody could find a solution to my problem. Like a ray of hope in the darkness, a Yogi gave me the address of a hill tribe herbal doctor. It's in thick forest area on the western side of Gadwal. Yes. I'll not leave you... His evil soul will not rest till he avenges by killing you and your family. It'll keep chasing you. Likewise nobody can change the rule of nature. If you're born, death is inevitable. There's an end to his soul. Is there an end to it? How? Tell me... tell me... Even Lord Rama needed a weapon to kill demon Ravana. Like that you too need a weapon. Where can I get that weapon? Where? I'll get it at any cost. Tell me... where can I get it? Where's that weapon? Your death! Yes, your death! - My death? That weapon must come out from your death. I didn't get you. Gods created a powerful weapon using a great Saint's back bone, that weapon is Lord Indra's 'Diamond Weapon'. A weapon to wipe out evil. Like that this weapon too will destroy him. How can I kill him with a weapon made from my death? Death is for body only not for soul. You'll take birth again to kill him. Yes, you'll take birth again. You'll take birth in the same family. She's indeed Jejamma! He needs a human body to torment you after coming out. Then, you must kill him. Then...? Remember it, there's only one chance to finish him. I'll not let go this only chance. I'll become the weapon that will destroy him. Then, get ready to sacrifice your life. Come back after giving up all your bonds. I'm going on a pilgrimage, I may or may not come back. - Madam! Name the first girl child in the family after me. Trust that I've come back as her. You must respect her like you respect me. There is an end to his atrocities. That' why I'm going. There is an end. There is... Give me a painful death I can't bear. The pain I experience must lit fire of revenge in his evil soul. What a great sacrifice you chose... With raging fire in heart... Sacrifice of the highest order... You tied hell of death to your sari end... Even death shed tears seeing you, O Jejamma... Pain of death is happiness to me. The happiness of finishing him. The blood flowing out is praising you... A weapon to kill me? Where is that weapon? I let you to read till now to keep you alive. With the hope of killing me, you must franticly search for that weapon and get tired. I must have you after you get vexed and tired. That's my wish. Today is no moon day, a total dark night, For me it's first night. This night is mine! Tonight at this time, your people, those who help you, your family, all would die. you will come to me on your own and ask me to have you. Bommali, you will lose honour tonight at the time I mentioned. You'll lose yourself, your people would die, Run... run for your weapon. Run till you reach my bed. Run! Hey rogue! Almighty is watching you from up there! Allah will stop your game. Satan, God will never let evil win! Madam Jejamma, I know the hill tribe written in that. If we go there we can get information about the weapon. We must bring it before midnight or else we'll lose everything. Come. No Chandramma. It's not safe for you to come with us. You stay here only. Not here, that Satan will kill her, stay in my place, Allah will protect you. Come madam... come. Go! I'll not leave you! Get that car. - Okay sir. Hi! How are you, sir? Is it? How are you now? - Who are you? Who are you? - Is it necessary? If you listen carefully what I say, your Bommali's life and honour will be safe. - What? Come to Gadwal! Would you like to see your Bommali die like this? What should I do now? - Come to Gadwal! Come... Your husband is coming to Gadwal to die in my hands. Allah! That Satan will not spare him. How? What to do now? Come... come... come... What happened? Don't cry... your husband hasn't died yet. Get down, it's Gadwal! How to go to Gadwal? - That auto will take you. - Do you know little fort here? I'll take you. Protect him... save his life. It's my duty to take anyone to little or big fort. It'll be good if anyone saves him. Why did he come here? What am I to do now? You go and sit in that last vehicle. I'll come back after sending someone. Will you save him, old Bommali? - Yes. You'll save him only if you're alive. - Pasupathi! Stop... stop... Where to? - Come. Come... come... - Where?- Come, I'll tell you later. We must go to the Fakir's house. - Please listen to me. I'll not leave you, Bommali! This is Allah's protection! He mustn't come out. Come... come... tie this amulet. - Wait... who is he? What is this? - Let me tie it. What is happening here? - Tie it. What is happening? What is going on? Let me tie it. Who is he? He mustn't come out! Open the door... open the door! What can I do? What happened? - Why did you all come here? What happened? - Go away from here. What happened? Protection... he mustn't come out. Over! Please listen to me. Madam... the old lady in your home... - What happened to her? She's dead! No! Everyone will die! He killed her! What happened? - He killed her. What's this? - Listen to me and go away... Go away! Go away! Must find the weapon before midnight. Madam Arundhati. She's the one. Baba, madam Arundhati... - Reincarnated after so many years. I'm coming, Satan! Here! This one! This one! Satan, you're end is nearing. Remember this! This weapon which was made from Jejamma's bones, It must get soaked in blood with vengeance. Only then the weapon will get power to finish an evil soul. Or else it'll get destroyed by that evil soul. You're finished, Satan. Would I die? All directions turned void... Light turned into darkness... No more any wishes... Just breathing to live... Your entire family will perish. you will come to me on your own and ask me to have you. My first night with you, this night is mine. This is truth, the day he comes out will be no moon day. Sky will cry like Partridge! Foxes will yelp! Bats will crackle! At that time, he'll definitely come to rape you. Queen is here! New sari, take it. Don't harm my people. You need a Queen's chamber, right? Quick! I can't hold once I smell female! Allah the great! I'll come! I'm decaying with sexual urge. Come... come... Go fast... fast... Remember, he must get into a human body. Only then he should be killed. - You're finished! Fulfill the unfulfilled desire. Madam! Hey Satan! Here's the weapon! Kill the Satan. Madam! Satan! Is it real or am I hallucinating? The weapon must get soaked with her vengeful blood. Blood... the weapon must soak with your blood. Blood... blood... It must soak with her blood. Satan, you will die! Jejamma will kill you. I swear on Almighty Allah! Jejamma will kill you. Where will you go now? You've no other choice. Your evil desire will not get fulfilled! I'll not let you to touch my shadow also. I'll not let you. I'll not let you spoil my virginity. The weapon must soak with her vengeful blood. Then the weapon will get power to destroy the evil soul.
