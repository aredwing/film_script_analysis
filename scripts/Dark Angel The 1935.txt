Mmm, but I'm trying To be late, granny. You should be About an hour late, really. Often I would be Two hours late, And a young man Would be very anxious. Not my young man. Just wouldn't wait. Have you got My secret safe? Oh, quite safe. Yes, here it is. Do you know what I'm Going to do with this? Give it to Gerald. I am not. It's for Alan. Oh, you knew it All the time. Poor Gerald. Doesn't he get anything? No. It's for Alan, And I'm going to marry him. Look, look, Kitty. Look. Granny! Hold the nest While I dress. I will be late. Good morning, father. Good morning, Darling. Good morning, Aunt Josephine. Good morning, Kitty. Good morning, Lawrence. Goodbye, Aunt josephine. Goodbye, Kitty. Have a good time. I will! Take good care Of yourself! I will! Goodbye, darling! Goodbye! Must we have A draft, Henry? I believe in children eating Their breakfast at home. Well, Lawrence Is at home. Yes. Lawrence is at home. And why? Because the shannons don't Condescend to ask him over with Kitty. Come, josephine. Don't Imagine those foolish things. Of course Mrs. Shannon Knows I'm penniless And Lawrence Hasn't a father. Considering that she Adopted Alan trent, Who has neither A father nor a mother, And brought him All the way from canada, That doesn't seem Very likely. Alan was Her sister's son, But my poor Lawrence Isn't good enough for them. I don't want to go, Anyway. Not a bit. So there. Good morning. Good morning, martin. The master's started prayers, Miss Kitty, but good morning. Am I awfully late? I'm afraid so. Down, Peter, down. Come along, Miss Kitty. They'll dirty My frock! Oh, lord, Our heavenly father, Almighty and everlasting god, To whose watchful Providence we owe it... ...that no... To whose watchful providence We owe it that- Good morning! Morning! To whose watchful providence We owe it That no disturbance Has come nigh to us. Look, Alan. It's a bird's nest. I found it Under my tree. I brought it for you. It's only A moldy sparrow's nest. The mother's deserted it Ages ago. Can I have it, Kitty? Yes, Gerald, You can. Humbly Beseeching thee to accept... Praying for dogs- That's what it amounts to. Morning service For the dogs. Have the kidneys very hot. Very hot. Kitty, next saturday I hope you'll be kind enough To bring your horse In with you. I should like to have the Entire animal world with us, Like noah's ark. I suppose you didn't bring that Moth-eaten bird's nest with you. Oh, Alan, I'm so sorry. I left it at home. That's all right. I might Have carried these eggs in it. It doesn't matter. What was that? Just a gust of wind. But it came up so quick. Look! There's nothing now. Maybe it was A whirlwind. That wasn't A whirlwind. It wasn't a wind At all. It was a warning... A warning. You're barmy. I told you not to have A third sausage roll. Well, I'm gonna look For some more eggs. I'm much too full To argue. Oh, and if you get Any more warnings, Let me know. Tell me, Alan, What was this warning of? It wasn't a warning At all, silly. I made that up To keep Gerald in his place. He shows off a bit because He's older than I am. It was a warning All the same, A special warning Just for you and me. That wind said That we ought to get married. I told you we ought. I've said so lots of times. Now, we're not going to start That marriage business over again. But you promised To let me know. I can't waste The best years of my life Just waiting for you. Look here, Kitty. I'll make up my mind soon. Very soon. How soon? Oh. In about a week. All right. I'll give you a week more. Do you think You'll say yes? Oh, I daresay. There's no one else To marry, is there? Now what's the matter? Nothing. Nothing at all. Smile. Come on, now, smile. Look, Kitty, if you Smile, I'll marry you. How's that? Let's go and get Some more eggs. All right. Good morning, granny. Good morning, darling. You're early. It's saturday, granny. A big saturday, too, Isn't it? The biggest ever. Granny... At first, seeing them As soldiers was fun, And I suppose I never really Thought they'd be going away. But now, I'm frightened. I know. Don't let them know That you're frightened, dear. No. Of course I won't. Anyway, they've promised me They'll be back very soon. Granny... I wish I knew... I wish I were really sure... You're not? No. When you love so hard And for so long, You can never Really be sure. And it used to be So easy, granny! I'd just ask him To marry me... But now... It's growing up, granny, That's what it is. Things aren't So simple anymore. I can't just say, "Alan, Please marry me, quick." Why not? That's the best way To do it. Saves a lot of time! I'll bet that's Just what you'd do. Heavens, look at the time! I must fly! You're going to be early Again. Am I? How dreadful. Yes, I suppose I always will be. Goodbye, granny. Goodbye, darling. Best love To Alan and Gerald. Good morning, father. Morning, darling. Good morning, Aunt josephine. Good morning, Kitty. Good morning, Lawrence. Morning. Goodbye, father. Goodbye, dear. Goodbye, aunt josephine. Goodbye, Lawrence. No speeding, mind. You've loads of time. My regards To the boys. I will. Isn't it about time Kitty Became engaged To one or the other Of those young men? Perhaps she Hasn't been asked. Ha ha ha! Well, she can't go wrong. Fine boys, both of them. Good stuff in those boys. I suppose that's a dig At my poor Lawrence. Oh, nonsense, Josephine. The canteens are Just as necessary as... It's most unfair And unkind. You know very well Lawrence Would have joined the infantry If it hadn't been For his hammertoe. Mother, can't you forget About my hammertoe? Morning, Miss Kitty. Morning, martin. Poor old Peter. He's a very old dog, Isn't he? Peter's 14, Miss. That's 98, Humanly speaking. He's outlived his master By two years. Hello, Kitty. Hello, Kitty. Good morning. Good morning. Well! What? The new uniforms. Let me look at you. Stand back From the table. Farther. Turn round And let me see you. Like to see me In profile? Gerald, You do look handsome. I'm in profile. You know, I think Gerald's coat fits better. I just can't find words To express you. Come, children, Breakfast is getting cold. And you'll need neckties, And handkerchiefs, And plenty of books- You think we shall have Much time for reading? And a dinner coat. We each have a new one. An opera coat, and a violin, And keats' sonnets. Whenever there's a raid, we'll Have to get all dressed up. Certainly. The enemy Won't like us if we don't. Oh, Gerald, do make him Have a haircut once a month. He's so dreadful Without one. "captain Gerald shannon," Says the colonel, "look at your friend And relative lieutenant trent. A disgrace!

And a spot of supper Right after that? Are you two going to spend The whole 10 days eating? We decided on it Months ago. Eating, sleeping, bathing. Eating, sleeping, bathing. Maybe we could think of some way Of eating while we're sleeping. We haven't thought about This thing enough, Gerald. Very dull, Aren't they? Very dull indeed. When was the last time You ate, pig? From the pure, white hands Of your cousin, Lawrence Bidley. We hadn't seen england for 11 Months, and our first sight of it Had to be Lawrence Bidley with A thermos bottle in his hand. Gerald wanted To turn back. Said you meet a better class Of people in the trenches. Kitty and I had planned Some things We thought You might like to do. Had you? Let's hear them. First of all, Lunch at the restons. And on friday, The vicar is having A fete for the red cross. Well, that Needn't trouble us. I'm afraid he hopes You'll open it. Did you tell him I would? Your mother didn't quite Like to go as far as that. I think that Gerald Ought to open it. Then, on Saturday afternoon, There's a concert In aid of The cottage hospital. And on saturday evening, We shall both go there. This is worse Than the war. Well... Speaking of hot water. How about a long... ...hot bath! You can both come and talk Through the door if you like. We'll wait. It's lovely having them Home again, isn't it? I've missed them both Terribly. Well, I'll see you all At dinner. You're not Staying with us? They'll be out of those Baths in an hour or two. They'll want to See you alone. Kitty, they'll want to See you alone. They came home for that. I've wanted to say this For a long time. They both love you Very much. I love them, too. Yes, but Kitty... I want you to know, dear, That whichever you choose, I shall understand. You've always Understood. You've been a darling. Goodbye, Peter. Where are you going? Want a piece of cake? No, I'm going home. I'm tired of seeing you eat. Wait a minute! We'll come with you. Maybe there's something new To eat at your house. Hey, wait a minute! No. Goodbye. Say, Kitty. Look. If you don't wait, I'll jump. Go back in, idiot. Will you wait for me? No. Alan! Alan, darling, you're not hurt, are you? Alan, darling. Alan. Clown. Are you cross That I'm not hurt? I did scratch my hand. It's serious. I think that's the Way you get leprosy or something. Good. You've changed. You're so bloodthirsty. And you, You haven't changed. You're still a child. You don't feel it. What don't I feel? You don't feel anything. You don't- Don't I? How do you know what I feel? You know about The months I've been away, The agony I've been through Because of you? You know how frightened I was of coming home And finding That you had changed, That you didn't feel... The Things I wanted you to feel? How frightened I am now Of saying what I want... Look here. I can't say it all. Maybe I can't say Any part of it Because I'm scared. But Kitty... Kitty, I- I've so much love for you. It's like something you've Saved up for a lifetime And didn't know about, Then it all comes at once. Alan... Alan, darling. I've wanted to hear you Say that so much. Darling, Surely you knew. I wasn't sure. You see, I've always Been around... I know. When I first looked through The bars of my crib, There you were, Telling me what to do. I was not. When I saw my first tree, You were in it, peering down. My first bird And my first squirrel, My first bath, You were always there. That's what Makes me afraid. You may be just used to me. You may meet some girl... Why, you sweet idiot. Don't ever say that. There'll be no one else, Ever. I've tried, my darling. It isn't any good. If ever you weren't there, I'd stop living. I'd stop breathing. I'd stop Wanting to breathe.

Dear. Gerald, I'm so sorry. What a bad homecoming For you. And I wanted it To be different, So much happier for you. No. It couldn't have been. Gerald, it was The night of the 17th, Wasn't it? Yes. What-what time was it? I don't know, dear. There- There was an explosion. We never saw him again. I think it was Shortly after... Shortly after 8:00. I knew. I'd been so happy. He'd wired me that he Expected to get leave. And then... He wanted to get leave. He wanted to come home to you. And he couldn't get it? I wouldn't give it to him. What? I could have Given him leave. I refused. It was intentional. What are you talking about? What are you saying? Gerald! You were devoted to him. You would have done Anything for him. I'm telling you What I did for him. I killed him! Can't you understand it? If I'd given him that leave, He'd be alive today. I killed him. Why didn't you Give it to him? Why didn't you want him To come home? I can't tell you. A misunderstanding. Tell me what it was. I've got to know. It can make no difference now. Let's leave it alone. I- I was mistaken. Stop it! Stop it! What nonsense are you talking? What are you sparing me from? What difference do I make now? Tell me what it was, Gerald. I've got to know. Can't you see? I shall only torture myself. It was that night Our leave was cancelled, That night at folkestone. I thought I... I believed... You thought He was not alone? Is that it? Oh, Kitty, For heaven's sake. You were right. I was with him. Kitty. So it was that... That night that caused... You killed him, You say? You killed him? You mean we killed him. It was that night. It was because I loved him so. Because I loved him so, He died. We killed him. In some crazy way, Between us, We killed him. Alan! Oh, Alan! Alan! Every one of you men Who are gathered here Has made A great sacrifice... ...the greatest sacrifice A man can make In the service of his country Unless it be life itself. I know, my friends, That for the things Of the eye You must now substitute The things of the spirit. But where before You saw the green grass, The flowing brooks, The hills in all their colors, The leaves of the trees... What are those Compared to the inner beauties That only you, my friends, Who have lost the sensual, The minor sight, Will be able to discover. Your country will be There behind you. Do you have to stand there And tell us what we're missing? Curse the things Of the spirit! Curse them! It's the other things We want to see, And your fine words Don't make it easier. It's the green grass And the flowing brooks And the hills In all their colors And the faces Of those people we love- Those are the things We want to see, And those are the things We'll never see again! What do we care How grateful you are? I want to see my girl again. That's all I want to see. That's all I want to see! Shut up! Shut up, I tell you! We know what you feel. We feel it too. What good does this do? Shut up and sit down. I'm sorry. It can't be helped sometimes. Gentlemen, I think We're all tired. I'll extend your regrets To our guest, Mr. Tanner, And I'm sure he'll understand. Now, suppose we all Go to bed, And I hope You all rest well. Are the lights out yet? How the devil Do I know? What difference Does it make, anyway? No, they're not out yet. Can't you tell When they go out? No, I can't. I guess I'm not used to it yet. There go the lights now. Can't you Tell the difference? No. Good night, George. Good night, archie. I say. Yes? Thanks for stopping me Down there. Oh, that's all right. Good night, Crane. Good night, austin. Y. Darling, good night. I hope you're not Too glad to leave us. No, I think I'm rather sorry. You want to join them Out there, Crane? Oh, no, thank you. I must be off soon. We haven't been able to help You very much, I'm afraid. That's true, sir. It's Been my fault, not yours. Fighting something With yourself, aren't you? Yes, I suppose You could call it that. You don't want to Talk about it? No, sir George. All right, Crane. Now, there are a few routine Things I must tell you. First of all, I'm Assigning an orderly to you. He's a very pleasant fellow. Worked for us before. He will stay with you Until you're settled. I'd rather not. Those are the rules. He'll take you To your home... But I'm not going home. I have no... Home. And your name Is not roger Crane. It's as good a name As any other. Yes, I suppose so. In any event, It's your own business. I've some things here That belong to you. A few pounds, A very Disreputable-looking pipe... Thank you. ...and a picture. Oh. May I...? No. I've kept These things for a reason. Now, look here, Crane. You came to us From an enemy prison hospital. Your card read that all means of Identification had been destroyed, But that you'd given The name of roger Crane. Now, I could have pursued The matter of identification, But I didn't. I knew that. I was grateful. May I- I knew that you were trying To put the past behind you, But today- Today the past has come back, And must be faced. The picture. This picture's Of three people, And I see there's An inscription on the back. "take care of each other. Kitty." Those people are not Strangers to one another. Why aren't you going home? Fear of being pitied, I suppose. Fear of being a nuisance. That's been your fight? Yes. All right, Crane, Then fight your fight through And go home. Now, look here. I want You to do something for me. I want you to prove to me That I'm not a failure By going back to your people And your friends And living among them Like an ordinary man. You need owe nothing To anyone but yourself. But you do need Love and companionship. You can't live without them, You know. Now, go home. You think I should? You think it's right? Yes, Crane, yes... I do. I've wanted to, Every day, every hour. The sun's out, isn't it? Yes. And before it goes down, You can be home. Before it goes down, I can be home. It's true. Think of it. Before it goes down, I'll be- I'll be home! Now we're coming Into medford. I used to come here for The fair when I was a boy. Pretty country, Isn't it? What time do you make it? 12:20, sir. Getting very near. I make it 12:23. You must be a little slow. Another 22 minutes. The last minutes Are always the longest. Yes. Do you mind if I step out in The corridor and have a bite, sir? No, you go. I suppose I've about talked your head off. Oh, that's all right, sir. Care to see the paper? Thanks very much. Thank you. Why, I'm sorry. I - I didn't know. I hadn't any idea. That's all right. It was very kind of you. I was just showing off. Sir George would have Liked that, wouldn't he? Well, I think I'll Join you in a smoke, Stretch my legs. Excuse me. Is it far To your home, sir? Not very far. There used to be a very Dilapidated cab outside the station. Haven't you told them You're coming, sir? No. You see, I only made up My mind at the last minute. You won't mind My mentioning it, sir, But, uh, They know that you... No. Be pretty much Of a shock, won't it, sir? I'm here, darling. Can't you- Can't you see me? I can't see anything else, But I can see you. I've seen you every minute, This whole long time. Your face is turned up To me, And that long, slow smile makes You look like a little girl again. Kitty, you are Smiling, aren't you? Yes. Yes, darling. Come down now, Alan. Take my hand. I'll help you. Blind! Coming home, I guess. Sad. That poor girl, Married to him, Day in, day out, Helping him... Take my hand, Darling. I'll help you. I'll help you. Help me? Help me. Help me! They're Pulling in, sir. This is it, sir. Camden junction. We're not getting off. Sir. Why, what's the matter, sir? You said This was your station. We're not getting off. That was The London train. Yes, of course. It passes every day At this time. Yes, I know. But today I just happened To think of it coming in. I don't know why. Betty. Betty! Come here at once. I've unpacked Your things, sir. The bell's Near the end of the bed If you should Want anything, sir. There's an oil lamp Beside the bed. You be careful. Is there anything else I can do for you, sir? No, thank you. Good night, sir. Get a good night's rest. Good night, mills. I'll turn the gas off here Before I go, sir. Are you sure I- May I come in? It's me, betty. I brought the water. Why do you stand there Like that? You look so funny. Go on, ask him. It's my brothers. Do you mind? They wanted to look at you. They've never seen a blind man. Are you cross with us? No, no. Look at me, By all means. Look. Why, now, What's all this? Come, come. This won't do. Don't cry, please. Here, here. Take my handkerchief. There. There. That's it. That's better. It's- It's Miss Gallop, isn't it? Yes. And these Are my brothers. Well, it was kind of you To come and see me. Shall we sit down? There's a big chair Somewhere around. Here it is. Thank you. Here. I thought you were angry. You weren't. Were you? No, no. Here's Your handkerchief. Thank you. Could you Introduce me to your brothers? This is joe And this is ginger. Hello there. Hello! And I'm betty. You called me Miss Gallop. Let me have A look at you, betty. How can you? Oh, this is A nice little face. Nice perky little face. Now I know Just what you're like. Like to have A look at me? Is this ginger? Yes. Oh, he's all right. Your nose turns up A little bit, doesn't it? Yes! Now do joe. No, I don't want to Be looked at. Let's go. We'll see you In the morning. That's right. We're going On a picnic. Do you Want to come with us? We're going fishing. You are? Well, Good night. Good night, Betty. Good night. Children! This is the last time I'm going to tell you. Take off your caps and make up Your minds to stay in the house. It's going to rain All day. I'm sorry. Mother says we Can't go to the river today. What? Oh, I'm afraid I'd forgotten. But we'll surely Take you tomorrow. All right. What are you Going to do today? I don't know. I thought grownup people always Had something to do every day. I thought so too. Now I find It isn't always true. When I grow up, I'm Going to be a white whale And live in the river. Don't listen to him. The other day, He wanted to be a horse. Ha ha ha! Well, ginger doesn't seem To like the human form, at any rate. I'm going to be A dressmaker Or a singer When I grow up. Would you like me to sing? Oh, no, no. What did you want to be When you were young? A writer. Then why didn't you? I don't know. I suppose for the same reason Ginger won't be a white whale. A writer? That's nice. I've got a pencil. Would you Like to write something now? No, no, indeed. That was A long time ago, betty. Oh. Maybe down by the river You will write us something. I told you this morning, He can't even see the river. You can't see anything, Can you? You're very snobbish About your eyes, joe. Maybe I'll be able to see Some things about the river That you can't see. Like what? You see? Well, you can see That it's a river, Just a pretty Country river, But I can see That it's big and wide, And that its banks Are tangled With a strange kind Of undergrowth, A kind You've never even seen. And there are sounds That you've Never heard before. Bright-colored wild birds Are flying about. Monkeys are jabbering In the trees, And there are large Green crocodiles in the river. You hear the crocodiles, And you don't like The sound they make Because you've got to swim Through them to rescue betty, Who's been taken captive By a cannibal. Who, me? You. And dimly Through the jungle, Joe and ginger Can hear your cries Above the strange song Of the birds And above the shrill chatter Of the monkeys. Suddenly, You and ginger Jump into the river... "jack and Peter Were with her on the trip, "and nothing else mattered To Jennifer, "for the boys, Tired of fishing, "were splashing about In the sea, "having left Jennifer on board To watch the lines. In their haste... " "they had swum a little distance Away from the side When a puff of wind Stirred the sails." I smell plum cake, Or am I mistaken? Do you think we ought to Eat the cake now? I mean while I'm here, So that I'd know Whether it was right or not. No. We must wait until Hannah brings in the tea. I wouldn't ask For a piece of cake. I wouldn't do that, But if my brothers Were here, They wouldn't mind asking One little bit. But I wouldn't ask. No, no. Not you. "they had swum a little Distance away from the side When a puff of wind Stirred the sails." "the boat gave a quiver, And Jennifer jumped to her feet. "suddenly, she realized To her horror "that the boat was moving. "in terror, She rushed to the side And shouted, 'Peter!'" Will Jennifer get mad And slap Peter? That's what I'd do. No, no. She likes him. Doesn't he like her? Yes, he likes her Very much. But he won't know how much Until a long time later. Will that be In the book, too? No. No, that won't be In the book. On what platform does the Dover express arrive, please? Number five, Miss. Thank you. Kitty! Gerald. Gerald, I'm so glad. I'm so glad, too. I didn't know- I didn't know that you'd come.

There he is. Yes. Father and granny Are so anxious to see you. Granny says that No one plays cribbage Quite as well as you. We told her that you might Want to do a few other things, But she wouldn't Listen to that. Why didn't you Come home before? Why did it take you So long? I- I couldn't till I was all right With myself. I know. I felt that too. We were both wrong That night. I know that now. It took me a long time To find it out. I wanted to come home.

When I was a kid, I used to think That napoleon made all this himself, That he spent That entire year Doing nothing But making brandy. Well, the history books- The history books could have Told you differently. In those days, I never could understand How he had time For waterloo-ha ha ha!- With all the brandy-making Going on! How is it? Hmm? Oh. Mmm. Not bad. Roger, you were In the engineers, weren't you? Yes. Did you ever run across A chap called shannon? Yes, we were In the same field company. Do you remember A photograph of yours I gave back to you When you left us? Yes. I think these are The same people. "Gerald shannon And Kitty Vane." Is that right? There's a picture of them Here in this tattler. They're going to be married. Are they? I'm very glad. We used to be Quite good friends. They've-they've been Very close to each other, All their lives. I was hoping This would happen. It's the way it should be. Well, me for bed, I think. I always like to Turn in early the first night. How about you?
