Some of you I have met already over the years. Tonight, the family members of the many victims Shall see due justice, As one-Time preacher, Turned convicted mass murderer, Dietrich van Klaus, Is put to death By the means of electrocution. [ Keys jingle ] For Catherin Tomkins and Lauren Delany, Who, only by the grace of god Escaped his murderous rampage and are still with us today. But as for the not so fortunate: Beth Holmberg, a young high-School girl Walking home from choir practice after school, Slain in cold blood; Newlyweds James and Betsy Drews, Taken from us only a week after they married; Kenneth Darwin, His body so mutilated It was nearly impossible to identify him; Claire bell, A young aspiring actress; And lastly, his mother and father. What kind of child would kill their own parents? I do not know. But I do know this: There is no place on this earth for such a person. And though it will not bring back the departed, It shall hopefully bring some comfort To all those in need. [ Door thuds ] At this time, you are entitled To make any apologies or verbal reparations To family of the victims Whom you have so greatly harmed. [ German accent ] indeed I have, warden. I would like to recant my father's favorite passage From Leviticus that he so often loved to quote. "Any man that blasphemeth the name of the lord "Shall surely be put to death, "And all of the congregation shall certainly stone him. "As well as the stranger "As he who is born in the land, "When he blasphemeth the name of the lord, "Shall surely be put to death! "And if a man cause a blemish unto his neighbor, As he hath done, so shall be done to him!" No! Aah! [ Blood gurgling ] "An eye for an eye!" Aah! "Tooth for a tooth." [ Thunder ] "As he has caused a blemish in his neighbor, So shall it be done to him!" Get those straps on! "And Moses spake to the children of Israel." [ Thunder ] "Bring forth he who has cursed outside of the camp And stone him with stones!" "And the children of Israel, They did as the lord commanded!" You are all sinners in the eyes of the lord! Forget about it! Forget it! Sinners! You are all sinners! Each and every one of you shall die a horrific death! Sinners! You are all sinners! - Throw that switch! - [ Thunder ] [ Shouting in German ] [ Power generator whirring ] [ Van Klaus screaming ] [ Thunder ] [ Rock music ] # Today ain't all that you want it to be # # 'Cause nobody'll let you down # Man: Got it! - [ Horn honks ] - Hey! Yeah! - Johnny! - Oh, Johnny! You guys ready or what? How are ya? Good. How you doing? Good to see you. Good to see you good! Good! Mmm. [ Chuckles] - Johnny? - Tony. Johnny: Hey. - Hi. - Johnny. Nice to see you. Hey. I want you now. Out of the way, Lovebirds. Come on. Don't be jealous. Tony: I don't think it's jealousy. [ Conversations continue indistinctly ] What's wrong with you? Get that out of your mouth! Could you just relax? You know we can get in trouble for that, right? - What's wrong with you? - Oh, my god. What are you, 5? Relax. Seriously? Look at this guy. - Kyle, hey, hey. - Really? There's gonna be plenty of time for this, - Plenty of time. - Fine, fine. And a better place. I get shotgun. How does he even get that in anyways? It's Kyle, man. I don't know what to tell you. Kyle: [ laughing ] yeah! - Start it up. - Look at this thing. - Whoo! - Whoo-Hoo! All right, guys, cell phones, pass them up. What? - Pass them up. - What? Pass them up. I told you guys. We said no phones this weekend. - Come on, you were serious? - Yeah. So stupid. Come on, guys. We all agreed to this. You guys said you wanted to have a nice weekend, Relax, no phones, no bosses. Yeah, yeah, I know what we said. Here. It's my iPod. Yeah, I know what it is. Where's the phone? I didn't bring it. [ Whispers ] she's lying. - Aw, come on. - [ Stops engine ] Fine, just take it. - There we go. - Dumb. Throw those things in the glove box. Let's lock it up. Better hope you don't lose that key. Not gonna lose the key. You guys ready? - Yeah! - Let's do this! Whoo! [ Rock music playing ] # Time is runnin' out now # It's time to scream and shout now # # On and on and on # Just kick it away # Well, I'm nothin' but a fuckin' lie # # Just cut it away # Well, I'm nothin' but a heartbreak # # Waiting for you # So, girl, you think you've got it made # # In my heart, I know you're walkin' away # # Bad news is always hangin' on you, yeah # # So, girl, you're feeling just the same # # In my heart, I know you're feelin' the pain # # Somebody should let you down, yeah, yeah # # Nah nah # Nah nah-Nah nah nah nah # # Nan nah-Nah nah nah nah # Nah nah-Nah nah nah nah # # Nan nah-Nah nah nah nah Nah nah-Nah nah nah nah # # Nah nah-Nah nah nah nah-Nah nah # # Nah-Nah nah-Nah nah # Yeah, yeah So, heath, you, uh, discover anything cool lately? I have actually, But nothing your feeble little mind Could possibly comprehend. Hey, heath, do you remember when you shot miss Heidelberg In the neck with a paperclip And she had to take sabbatical? Yes, I do remember that. That was fucking awesome. Hell of a shot, dude. It was good times. Don't forget about Tony's guinea ts, huh? Hey, it's a t-Shirt. Yeah, that's meant to be worn under your clothes, Not as dress wear. Pathetic. Hey, like you said, nothing has changed. By the way, when did you dye your hair? What? Yeah, didn't it used to be like a murky brown? It was dirty blonde. It was brown... ish. Wait, he shot the paperclip at the Handelman bitch? [ Laughter ] Hey, welcome back to the conversation, Kyle. You know, I actually missed you guys. You know, most people don't even keep in touch after high school. Yeah, it's kind of cool that we did. Wait, we're not in high school anymore? [ Laughter ] [ Rock music playing ] # You know I'm comin' with it, real tough fool # # And you know that I don't play around # # I start at mach speed and everybody's slowin' down # # Check the sound and you'll see that I ain't new to this # # The past five years # I'm the guy that you been cookin' with # # I stay original, that's why when you... # Tony: Can someone turn the air up? Kyle is smokin' the shit out of me. Kyle, how high do you plan on getting? Pretty damn big. Johnny: So you sell weed for a living? Kyle: Kind of. I mean, it's not like I declare it on my taxes, But, you know, it pays the child support, so... Proverbial stoner. That's me. Oh, check out that old graveyard over there. - Everyone hold your breath! - What? Everyone has to hold their breath! What are you talking about, jerry? When a really evil person dies And they're so evil that hell can't even take them, They're forced to roam around the cemetery That they're buried in, trying to find souls to possess. I heard of this. So when you drive past a cemetery, You have to hold your breath Or else they can possess you. Just everyone-Just do it! Where did you hear this? Dude, it's been around forever. - Never heard of it. - Me, neither. Yeah, it doesn't surprise me. Come on, you guys, this is serious. Just hold your breath, please? Really, guys, come on, please! Hold your breath! - [ Coughs ] - Whoa! [ Screams and shouts ] Heath: Whoa! Blech! Kyle, maybe you should lay off that shit, huh? I could have killed us! Are you listening to me? Yeah, I know. Is everybody okay? Dude, get me out of this thing. I need to take a piss. Well, looks like we're off to a great start To our first annual camping trip. Kyle: Ahh! Whoa! Johnny: Whoa, you all right? I'm fine. Hey, guys, come check this out! Samantha: What is it? I don't know, but it's freaky-Looking. Looks like a prison or something, doesn't it? Judging by the fact that we are indeed In the middle of nowhere. And with a fence built around the perimeter And what looks like a guard tower, I'd say, yeah, dude, it definitely appears To be a correctional facility of some kind. Got it. Think it's abandoned? Yeah, look at it. Awesome, we found an abandoned prison. Let's go. It's cool. Hey, tony. Back in a few. Dude, where you going? What? Are you guys kidding me? We have to be At the campsite before dark. Johnny! Natasha! - What are they doing? - They're gonna bang. Oh, this is bullshit! I'm gonna go get 'em. All right, I'm coming with you. Come on, seriously? He's gonna be done in a minute anyways. Jerry? Should we go? What do you think, man? No, y'all go on, but stay together. I'll see you real soon. All right. Let's go. [ Crows cawing ] [ Laughs ] this looks like it was some crazy asylum. [ Bars rattle ] Yeah, I don't know about this. Maybe we should go back. It'll be all right. Have you seen Johnny and Natasha? No, we haven't found a way in yet. I wonder how old this place is. Based on the architecture and building materials used, I'd say early 1900s. But, uh, yeah, It clearly hasn't been used for a while. Tony: You think, Sherlock? Jerry: There's got to be another way in. I vote we leave. Go back then. I'm gonna go for it. Ditto. Come on. Everything all right, son? I don't know. We were just driving down the road And the engine just died. All right, pop the hood, let me take a look. How long you been out here? Oh, not too long. I don't see anything wrong under here. Were those your friends I saw walking down the road? Sir, I asked you a question. Oh! This is how those little freaks got in. Jerry's finally home. [ Helmet clanking ] Nice kitchen. Hey, heath, how about you whip me up some pancakes? I'm good, man. I only eat waffles, so that would be stupid. Let's go this way. Where do you think they are? Wherever there's a bed. I think the only bed they're gonna find in here is made of stone. Let's go this way. Guess that's why they shut down the place. Which way do you think they went? Knowing them with their perversity, They probably went to the dance hall. Try to relive their prom night. The dance hall might be more interesting, actually. Yeah? Why is that? It's slang for execution chamber. How do you know that? Watch a lot of shows on prison. This is where they could stick the barrel of their guns out To shoot in case of an uprising. Oh, creepy. Oh! [ Laughs ] I hate rats! You're too big for it to eat. It could still bite me. Oh, my god. Ladies first. [ Sighs ] I have to take a leak. Right now? Yeah. What a weirdo. Well? I don't know. What do you think? Oh, come on, tough guy. Sure you're not the one who's afraid? I ain't afraid of nothin'. Samantha: Jerry? Hurry up! [ Crackling ] [ Gas sloshing ] I got something for you. Wake up. Wake the fuck up. [ Jingling ] You want the keys? What the hell's wrong with you? What are you doing? Fucking freak! I'll hold onto them. [ Groans ] Fucking animal! What are you doing? No! No! Don't! Come on! You freaking freak! [ Engine starts ] - [ Current buzzing ] - [ Screaming ] No, turn that thing off! I'm gonna kill you! [ Screams ] [ Neck cracks ] [ Crows cawing ] This place is creepy. Aah! That's not funny. [ Laughs ] I'm sorry. [ Somber rock music playing under scene ] Wow. This must have been for the real crazies. Looks like it, huh? # There was a smoke # That came at night Want to go in there? - # In the garden of my dreams - Could be fun, right? Yep. # Black water rushing in our face # # Craving this deep obsession # # Cover me with sweet possession # # Are we breathing fire and brimstone? # # Have the angels left us on our own? # # If a soul can survive even death # # Hold your breath # In the mirror, we can't see anything # # Drowning in soft illusion # # With every breath # The stakes have come to this # # I can see the demon in disguise # # I can see a killer in these eyes # # Are we breathing fire and brimstone? # # Have the angels left us on our own? # # If a soul can survive even death # # Hold your breath # Are we breathing fire and brimstone? # # Have the angels left us on our own? # # If a soul can survive even death # # Hold your breath [ Song ends ] Hey. Jerry, finally! Tony: Jeez. Thought you were alone. What's going on? Jerry: Are you gonna open it for us? [ Door thuds ] Wow, this is so cool. I can't believe they used to kill people like this. Well, Florida and some other states Still use it as a secondary means of execution. Seriously? Yep. I couldn't even imagine being electrocuted. See, they sit the guy right there, Put this right over his head just like so. Then they have all these people sitting right over there, Watching him, and then... [ shakes chair ] They'd zap his ass. Sit in it. What? Sit in it. Hell, no, I'm not sitting in that thing. You scared? Okay, you sit in it. I'm a girl. What the hell does that have to do with anything? What happened to you? You used to be such a bad ass. I still am. No, not really. You've changed since school. No, I haven't. I don't know. Okay, what do I get if I do it? Why? You never had to be bribed To do something before. Well, as you said, I've changed. What do you want? Blow me. [ Laughs ] Maybe. Well, I ain't sitting in this chair for nothing. All right, then. Guess you're not gonna get that blow job. Yes, but then again, you said maybe. Well, there's only one way to find out, isn't there? Hmm. You remember how good I give them? Fine. I'll sit in the damn chair, But... You got to keep up your end of the bargain. I said maybe. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Wh-What- What are you doing? I'm strapping you in. Oh, no, no, no, no. Not gonna happen. What? You think you're just gonna sit in the chair And that's enough? Come on, just get up, And I'll sit in the damn thing. No, no! Strap me in. All right, good boy. Sam, can you help me strap him in? Uh, I don't think so. Come on, help your sister out... Please? Are you sure this is such a good idea? Shh, just do it. Yeah, shh. Okay, you strapped me in. Now get me out of it. You only just got in it. [ Thunder ] [ Lights buzzing ] What the hell was that? I don't know. Just-Just get me out of this chair. Been sitting here long enough. You just got in it. You're gonna have to stay in it longer than two seconds If you want your little prize. I don't care! Just get me out of this chair! Oh, my god, You're really scared, aren't you? Get me out of this chair, jerry! [ Lights buzzing ] [ Thunder ] Get me out of the fucking chair! God, you are such a pussy. Calm down. - Jerry, let's just untie him. - Fuck you! It's not funny anymore. He's being ridiculous. [ Thunder ] Aah! Get me out of here! Get me out! - What is going on? - Calm down! Calm down! What is going on? Tony: Aah! Aah! Get me out! Aah! Get me out of here! Do you hear that? I don't hear anything. No, no, I'm serious. Wait. Listen. Tony: Aah! Get me out! Oh, my god! Who is that? It sounds like tony. Did they come down here? Maybe they're looking for us. - [ Thunder ] - Help me! Help me! - Okay! - Aah! What is up? I don't know! [ Thunder ] [ Tony screaming ] No. It's stuck. Aah! What is that? Oh... Back up. Stay back. Hey! Hey, back up, man! [ Tony screaming ] Back off! I'm gonna kill you. Swear to god, I'm gonna cut you. Ha ha! Whoa! It's me! It's me, man! [ Laughs ] What the hell are you doing? I was just gonna scare everyone. But then I heard tony screaming, And, well, I heard you guys, too, So I was gonna come get you. You're a fucking idiot. Idiot. I was just joking, man. - [ Thunder ] - [ Screaming ] How about now? I can't! Mine's stuck! [ Tony screaming ] Aah! God! - Tony! - Johnny! Aah! Get these things off of me! Get me out of here! - [ Thunder ] - Aah! You bitches! You almost killed me! Bro! Bro, you fucking saved me! You bitches! You almost killed me! What are you guys doing here? We're looking for you, asshole! Dude, I was strapped into this thing And the storm came out, And they almost killed me! Yeah, okay, are you all right? Is everyone okay? Fuck. Let's get the hell out of here. You guys couldn't wait to get to the campsite, huh? That's pretty pathetic. That's 'cause I don't fuck everything that walks. [ Crows cawing ] Uh, does this part of the country Always have sudden storms like that? I've never seen anything like this before. [ Whistling ] See ya later! All right. Yo! What have you been doing, man? Smoke some more weed? I'm fine. Sure? You don't look that good. Mind your own fucking business! Just don't ruin the weekend for the rest of us. Keys. Know what? Natasha's gonna sit in the front. Babe. [ Rock music playing ] Where is everyone? It's still early. Probably start filling up tomorrow. Let's just keep driving then. I want to be as far away from any kids and crowds As possible this weekend. Told you guys it was nice, huh? Huh? Damn it! Why did we give Johnny our phones? Hey, I don't like it either. You know, if you want your phone so bad, You can go ask him for it. Keep looking. It's as close as you'll ever get. That's everything. - Is it? - Yeah. Hey, I'm missing a bag. Somebody else grab it by accident? Bet it fell off when that stoner Flicked that pipe into Johnny's lap. - Hey! - [ Cough ] [ Coughs, groans ] You all right, Kyle? [ Groans ] He'll be okay for now. Come on, I'll drive you back. What happened? - He punched me. - [ Engine starting ] - He punched you? - Uh-Huh. Samantha: Kyle is such a creeper. Why'd we even bring him? [ Hits rock ] [ Splash ] You setting this up on your own? I'm gonna mess with Kyle. [ Laughs ] Perfect idea. Wait, let's just- Looks like he's having a nightmare or something. Aah! Freaking freak! Aah! Jerry: [ laughs ] oh, god. This is too perfect. Couple more. Hold on. Okay. Is he up? [ Laughing ] [ Both laughing ] Oh, my god! [ Laughing ] oh, is he still out? [ Thump ] [ Laughs ] man. What? Just everything that's happened so far. Kyle burning me, almost crashing, Going into that crazy asylum, Getting locked in the morgue, Tony almost getting electrocuted. He didn't almost get electrocuted. [ Thump ] [ Splash ] Look, Tony's just a big baby. He acts like he's all tough, but he's really not. Tony's tough. I've seen him do some damage. No, he's not like you. Like when heath was coming after us In that stupid Halloween costume, You didn't know who it was, But you pulled out your knife, And you pushed me behind you. That's 'cause you're my baby girl. It was really brave of you. I think that you deserve to be rewarded For your heroism. Mmm. I mean, I'm not one to brag, But, like, I was pretty brave. [ Laughing ] Okay, okay. Let's get this zipped up real quick. All right, that's not working. Oh, that's not working, either. There we go. [ Natasha laughing ] I hope I don't have too much trouble with your zipper. You okay? You been kind of quiet. Why are you suddenly not talking? You're funny, tony. All right, look, we're coming up On the cemetery here in a minute. Your bag probably just rolled off To the side of the road, yeah? Okay. Thank you so much for helping me. Yeah. Oh, hey, there it is. All right, get ready to hold your breath. Gotcha. [ Exhales ] What's the matter with you? [ Hammer pounding stake ] [ SUV horn honks in the distance ] Somebody's angry. Sounds like it. Hey, Sam and tony back yet? No, they're not, actually. Oh, yeah? How long has it been? It's been a while. They should be back. You want to go up to the road? You think they're still up there? I don't know, But beats sitting around here. Should we ask them to come? [ Johnny and Natasha laughing ] Johnny: Oh, oh, don't. No, don't tickle me, please, too. [ Natasha laughing ] Nah, looks like they're busy. [ Groans ] [ Coughs ] Okay, I'm really starting to freak out now. Yeah, let's go get Johnny. Okay. Hey, guys! Where you two been? Up at the road looking for Samantha. Natasha: They didn't come back? No. You try calling them? You are such an asshole! I'm just kidding. Go get the flashlights. Look, I'm sure they're fine. They probably just got a flat tire or something. Yeah, I hope so. We're gonna find them. All right, let's go. Wait, wait, wait. What about Kyle? Kyle? Aah! Aah! Get away from me! Shit. It's just me, dude. Calm down. Oh, my god, dude, I was having a nightmare. There were cops, And you and me were fighting about something. Think you need to lay off that weed, brother. Come on. Listen, tony lost a bag on the drive over. Him and Sam looked for it. It's been a couple of hours. We're gonna go find them. Do you want to come? Yeah, I'll come. You sure? Yeah, okay. [ Eyeball squishing ] [ Whimpers ] [ Gasping ] [ Coughs ] [ Coughing ] [ Crying ] [ Coughs ] [ Samantha whimpering ] [ Whimpering ] [ Starts engine ] Aah! Aah! [ Current crackling ] Aah! [ Panting ] [ Whimpering ] Aah! [ Neck cracks ] Look, it's the cemetery gate. Wait, wasn't it closed before? Yeah. Wait, guys, don't we have to hold our breath? No, that's only when you're driving by. It doesn't matter when you're walking. Come on. Check this out. It's definitely from a large truck or some kind of SUV. - Hey, Johnny? - What? Come take a look at this. What is it? Aw, shit. Jerry: What? Is that blood? That's what it looks like. Come take a look at this, man. - Fuck! - What is it? Whose blood? Huh. What, babe? Blood would indicate that there was an accident But if a vehicle lost control and crashed through a gate, Why is there blood here? Oh, my god. We need to go find Sam. Whoa! How do you know this has anything to do with Sam? They're probably back at the campsite. We should go back! Because those tracks look just like the ones from our car! So? It just-It doesn't feel right, okay? Sam would be back by now. She would never do this, okay? Just help me, please! Come on! [ Battery crackling ] Natasha: Jerry, we have no idea where we're going. What if we get lost? [ Horn honking ] Jerry: Did you hear that? Johnny: Yeah, we all heard it. Just slow down. It's over here, guys. What? Kyle: Oh, shit! - Sam! Sam! - No, jerry! Jerry! Jerry: No! Hold her! It's all right! No! Don't look! Don't look! [ Jerry crying ] Oh, my god, Sam! Don't look! Don't look! - Please! - Don't look! Sam! [ Jerry sobbing ] [ Sobbing ] The phones are gone, man. My god. My god. [ Sobbing ] A sacrifice for all you sinners. Johnny: Tony! What the fuck are you doing? Tony, what happened? Jerry: What did you do to her? What did you do to her? Knock it off, dude! What happened to Sam? What's wrong with you? Tony, talk to me. [ Laughing ] Are you kidding me? It's not funny, man! [ Gunshot ] - Oh! - [ All screaming ] Oh, fuck! Oh, shit! [ Crying ] What the hell you doing? It's a friend of ours! You call that a friend? He was ready to rip you a new asshole with a pitchfork. Now, I got a 12-Gauge, you got a knife. You might want to put away that knife. You take another step closer to me, You'd rather jack off a bobcat. Now, I'm asking you again nicely. Put away the knife, fucking please! What about her by the tree? Did you kill her, too? I don't know your friend. I've never seen her before. I hear a horn honking, He's ready to just impale you with a pitchfork. Well, that's convenient, huh? You just happen to be here? I might need to ask you the same thing. But I'm gonna tell you something right now. We got to get out of here. What the fuck are you talking about? I'll explain later. There's not much time. Now, we have got to go. Well, we can't just leave them here. The hell we can't. There's some things going on out here tonight, man, That you do not understand. Oh, you do? Yes, I do. [ Crying ] Please, we have to help her, please! No, no, stop! We can't help her now! Heath: She's gone, jerry. She's gone. We need to save her, please! No, it's too late! She's gone, jerry! She's gone! It's too late! Calm down! Please, calm down! Okay, cut the bullshit. I'm going, you're dying. All right, wait, wait, wait. We're coming. We have to get help for our friends. Your friends are dead. I know, I know, but we got to call the cops or something! Do you have a car? No. Okay, you have a phone, right? You have a fucking phone? Hello? Are you deaf? We need to get help. Are you paying somebody to help you misunderstand me? I am your help! Now let's get the hell out of here! Come on. Wait up! All right, y'all come on in here And y'all sit down. Who wants some coffee? Hey, could we get some answers? - Is that a phone? - Yes. [ Dialing ] Everything's gonna be okay. [ Clicking button on cradle ] Anything? No. Fuck. [ Cups clatter ] There you go. Pour your own damn coffee. That phone don't work, Ain't worked in about three weeks. Had a storm come through here. Stupid phone company ain't had the balls To come out and fix that thing. I thought I told you to sit down. You, uh, always have a fresh pot of coffee Brewing at this hour? Yes, I do 'cause I can't sleep at night. You want to know why? 'Cause I worked the graveyard shift Over at that goodchild asylum across the way. You heard of it? Yeah, we drove by it earlier. Look, we need to get a hold of the police. Police can't do shit. Can't do nothing till the morning. We're wasting our fucking time. We're out of here. Sit the fuck down! Y'all are gonna die tonight... Unless you do what I say. You're gonna end up like your two friends out there. That kind of sucks, don't it? Listen to me. My name is McBride, And I was a guard at that goodchild asylum. We had the worst, decrepit, nasty persons You could ever imagine. And many years ago, we executed One of the worst of them all. His name was Dietrich van Klaus. Never heard of him. Yeah, no shit, 'cause after we executed him, There was a fire that roared through there. Destroyed everything- Records, archives, But that son of a bitch was the worst one. [ Thunder ] Aah! You'd rather chew glass and beat off with sandpaper Than sit in the same room as that son of a bitch. Would you get to the point already? Shut the fuck up. Now, what happens is, Every year on his anniversary of his execution, His spirit runs free. That's what's going on right now. That's what happened to that boy out there that I had to kill, And he's the one that killed your little girl. Man, this is ridiculous. No, dude, tony was acting crazy. He's chasing us with a pitchfork? He tried to kill you. He did, man. Keep going. People wanted an end to van Klaus' terror. They wanted it to be over, And they wanted to move on with their lives, But that son of a bitch killed one more time. And when he did, what he did to warden Wilkes Is forever burned in my memory. And I knew something evil had a grip on van Klaus, And this wasn't the end. It was far from it. So what happens is, Every year on his anniversary of the execution, He runs free, And he's got a window. And that window ends tonight at midnight. How does he possess a body? There's a graveyard up on the road out there. Did you all pass that graveyard on your way in? Did you hold your breath? All of us, but, uh... But him. Did you feel any different? I don't fucking know. He was acting really strange. We thought maybe it's because he had Some bad drugs, though. How about now? Do you remember anything? I don't know. I've been having bad dreams. Tell him what happened when we went down to goodchild. I don't know, okay? I don't remember. It's all right. Don't freak out, don't freak out. 'Cause when a spirit possesses your soul, You forget about it. You can't remember shit. How about the rest of you? How are y'all feeling? Is everybody okay? 'Cause what can happen sometimes Is the spirit can jump. Jump? McBride: Mm-Hmm. If somebody's got some wicked thoughts Like they want to hurt somebody Or they want to kill somebody, That spirit can take that opportunity To possess that person's soul. So how do we prevent that? We just have to keep holding our breath? No, it's too late for that. Once that spirit is out running free, There's nothing you can do about it, Till we can put him back where he belongs. How do we do that? Young lady? How you feeling? Everything okay? That was her sister out there. That was your sister, huh? I'm real sorry to hear about that. I'm gonna go get us another pot of coffee. But we haven't even drank any. [ Gunshot ] - Hey, hey! - Move! - What are you doing? - He's here! - Van Klaus is getting away! - I'm not moving! - Get out of my way! - No! [ Panting ] You can't just go around killing everybody! There has to be another way to stop him! All right, then, there's not much time left. But, Johnny, you're gonna have to come with me, And the rest of you are gonna have to stay here. Why do the rest of us have to stay here? Because if there's too many bodies out there, Van Klaus can possess every one of you, And I'm not in the mood To shoot a bunch of 20-Somethin'- Year-Olds. I want to know where you're taking him. [ Keys jingle ] Let's go. [ Crying ] The rest of you stay here. You do not move. You wanted me to save your friend, right? Of course. This is how it's got to be. This is crazy. Why are we even listening to this guy? What are you talking about? God damn it, shut up! I'm telling you, this is the way it's gotta be If we want to save your friend. Johnny, are you in, or are you out? I'm in. All right, let's go. Hey, it's okay. Take care of her. I have a question. Do we get a gun or something? What the fuck are we supposed to do If that crazy bitch comes back? We need a weapon, a knife, something, anything! This isn't gonna work! Shit! [ Clattering ] I got this. - Heath! - No! Stop! You can't help him! We can't leave him here! [ Mixer whirring ] Oh, fuck, go! [ Mixer whirring ] No! Stop! No! No! No! No! No! No! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! [ Mixer stops ] [ Heath screaming and crying ] [ Mixer starts ] Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! [ Coughs ] [ Gasps, stops breathing ] [ Straining ] Shit. [ Grunting ] Come on. [ Owl hooting ] What now? [ Thunder ] What is with these electrical storms? They just come out of nowhere. So what are we doing? [ Thunder ] Hello? What, are you holding your breath? [ Thunder ] Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah! McBride. Sir. [ Thunder ] Van Klaus! I got somebody for you! Show yourself! Pussy! Johnny? Johnny! Aw, shit. Johnny! They got heath. Johnny, are you okay? Johnny, can you hear me? That's not Johnny. What? That's Johnny, it's his body, But he's been possessed by Wilkes, The warden. What? How could you let that happen? Who the fuck is Wilkes? What are you talking about? We let you have our friend, And you fucking put another spirit in him? Kid, you are about as confused As a baby in a titty bar. I told you to trust me. Johnny. Johnny, if there's any part of you inside of there, You let me know. You don't have to speak. Just give me a sign, something. Let him go. Any idea where he may be? She? Wilkes? McBride: You see something, Wilkes? You see something? Wilkes, what do you see? [ Thunder ] Shit. I don't get back much here anymore. Now the only way he can get out is past us, So I want you two to stay real close to us, you hear me? [ Thunder ] Not very flattering, is it? [ Muffled shout ] Kyle? Guys, Kyle's gone. Son of a bitch! That's exactly why I didn't want y'all to come out here! Look, do you think I asked for this? None of us asked for this, okay? All right, let's head on back. [ Kyle screams ] [ Thunder ] Kyle? [ Strained breathing ] You all right, son? Aah! Stay with us! Come on, hey. Hey, hang in there. [ Crying ] Come on. Damn it! Look, he's getting away. You go down one side of the path. I'll meet you at the mausoleum. Let's get this son of a bitch! McBride: Don't forget to hold your breath. Time to die, lieutenant. [ McBride groaning ] [ Grunting ] [ Jerry straining ] Aah! Unh! Unh! [ Groans ] [ Both grunting ] [ Johnny groaning ] Unh! Aah! Aah! [ Jerry groaning ] [ Electricity crackling ] The spirits are out of their bodies! [ Crash ] Let's get out of here before all hell breaks loose! [ Coughing ] [ Loud crashes ] [ Crash ] Johnny: Come on. All right. Johnny! Take the keys. Get the truck. Get the girls out of here! You're not coming? No, two demons are out. This is a game-Changer now. I got a chance to fix this thing once and for all. Go, Johnny. Go, go, go! [ Thunder ] McBride. Thanks. [ Engine starts ] [ Jerry coughing ] It's all right. It's out of you. Are you okay? I'm all right, I'm fine. I just feel sick. No, it's okay. [ Thunder ] We got to get out of here! Drive faster, drive faster! No, I'm trying, okay? I'm trying! Wilkes! Bring Klaus on! [ Thunder ] - Aah! - Oh, my god! [ All screaming ] What the hell is going on? [ Crash ] [ Noise fades ] Oh, god. [ Crying ] We need to get a phone and someone to help us. My leg is bleeding again. It won't stop. Wait. Wait, pull over. Pull over and see if we can use their phone. Jerry: If you hadn't taken our phones, We wouldn't even be in this mess in the first place! Jerry, that's getting really old! Are you going to go in or what? [ Doors lock ] [ Removes key ] - [ Gasps ] - Unh! Unh! Oh, my god! Oh, my- [ Gasping ] [ Crying ] Hello, gorgeous. [ Rock music ] # Trackin' all my day # Wreck, I'll show you the way # # Track, I know you like it # # Track, just count on me # Yeah # Dream awhile # What about you? # Here and now # Come take this away # Yeah-Eah # The chains, I have released them # # And it gets me near you # # While I am myself # Can even that explain you? # # Dream awhile # What about you # Here and now # Come take this away # Yeah-Eah [ New song begins ] # No, no, no # There was a smoke that came at night # # In the garden of my dreaming # # Black water rushing in our face # # Craving this deep obsession # # Cover me with sweet possession # # Are we breathing fire and brimstone? # # Have the angels left us on our own? # # If a soul can survive even death # # Hold your breath
