[ Woman Chuckling ] A little of both. - We used to be like that. - Yep, born to bop, that was us. [ Man ] Remember in academy, night before graduation? We were so hung over I thought I was gonna barf right in the mayor's lap. Oh, geez, about our first collar? Cha-cha all night and straight to the courthouse in the morning. You were wearing my personal favorite. Red dress, no back. I thought they were gonna run me in for soliciting. - [ Chuckling ] Pretty wild. - Mmm. We had good times. We're havin' good times. Tell me something, Emily. We in love? - We are in lust. - [ Chuckling ] [ Emily ] See those two? Just like my stool pigeon told me. It's goin' down. Where's our backup? You didn't let'em know? You didn't call for backup? Please, Emily. I hate this rogue shit -- Nick, Nick, if I may. This is not rogue. We just happen to be at the scene. Who the hell's gonna believe that kinda action? The "National Enquirer"? - Police. Freeze. - I'll take your little friend. Assume the position. Spread 'em. - [ Groan ] - Nick! You want it? [ Sirens ] [ Man ] We got a scoop and run! Respiration: 32. Blood pressure: 90 over 60. Heart rate: 135. He's gonna make it, right? I said, he's gonna make it, right? Not if you keep comin' at me he's not! - I'm sorry! - Fine! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [ Sirens, Beeping ] [ Whispering ] Ariel, stop reading. It's time for evening prayers. - Sher hamalos. - [ Together] Sher hamalos. [ Indistinct Chanting ] [ Man ] Excuse me, Commissioner. He's just gone up to the operating room now. [ Elevator Bell ] Make note of the time, Detective Eden. I'm relieving you of your weapon. - I.A.D. in the morning. - I shot the perp. Why should I have to face those headhunters? Because you used your weapon again. Emily, why didn't you call for backup? Because we thought we could handle it ourselves. No, you thought you could handle it by yourself. We got 27,300 police officers in the city. Isn't there anybody you trust? What are you trying to prove? [ Indistinct Chatter ] [ Indistinct Chatter ] Mah-tovi oaleich, Yaakov... mish kinoteichu Yisroel. - I wanna see him. - He's gonna make it. [ Beeping ] What's new and exciting? What? I'm not dead? [ Chuckle ] Geez, you really are some cowboy. Yeah, ahem, Calamity Jane. - Perps? - We got 'em. [ Whispering ] Good. Yeah. I -- [ Beeping ] Again. - If the Rebbe finds out -- - Who's going to tell? You shouldn't learn Kabbalah. Mysticism can shorten your life. On the other hand, it can lengthen your life. The Rabbis say we shouldn't study Kabbalah until the age of 40. Besides, only the most brilliant students... can understand it. Only the brightest can hope to understand its mysteries. I'll never reach that level. Yaakov, you're bright. You can study anything, anytime. Maybe. I'm not so sure. I think I'm better off where I am. I need your advice. The answer is: Yes, you should. - Yes, I should what? - Marry her. She's a fine girl. You'll be very happy. What is it? It's nothing. It's nothing. You're sure? You don't have the look of nothing on your face. - You have the look of something. - No, it's nothing. I should marry her, shouldn't I? You know what Mara told me? Not only is she going to be a wonderful wife, she's also going to be my best friend. Yaakov, listen. Would you like to hear something wonderful? "God counts the tears of women." What's it mean? I'm not sure. [ Chuckling ] Actually I just came across it in the Kabbalah. [ Train Approaching ] [ Buzzing ] Hello? Internal Affairs says you're spick- and-span. Deadly force was called for. Gee willikers, what a surprise. Think maybe it's because Nick's in the hospital? - I think you need some R and R. - I need to work. It's not your fault. [ Sigh ] What do you got? Please. Guy disappears on his family? What, are you kidding me? It's work. Um, I'm afraid the Rebbe has a very busy schedule today. - You're the policeman? - Police person. - Person? - Never mind. Policeman. Ah, come with me, please. [ Phone Ringing ] Hello? [ Woman ] This way. Wait here, please. Hi. [ Whispering ] Anshuldik mir. Zeer gut. Hi, I'm Detective Eden. Ah, I've been assigned to the Klausman -- Yaakov Klausman was reported as a missing person? Do these guys understand what I'm saying? - The Rebbe speaks eight languages. - Is English one of'em? Okay. You know, most cases where kids disappear... we're talking some kind of shit going on. Um. I know. I know. I apologize. I'm really not as stupid as I act. Relax. You're a very tense person. Which one of you is immediate family? - Are you the immediate family? - I'm Yaakov's father. Okay, good. Maybe there's some place we could go and talk. No. My Rebbe has to be here. [ Sigh ] So you're all like a family? In a manner of speaking. Thank you. Okay. Your son disappeared two nights ago? Did you fight with him? - No. - Your wife maybe? -Anything like this ever happen before? -Of course not. Has Yaakov exhibited signs of strange behavior lately... you know, being depressed, uncommunicative? - Staying alone in his room? - No. Is anything missing? Money? Jewelry? Diamonds are missing, yes. How much are we talking here? Wholesale, about $720,000. Well, look, I hate to say this, but if we're talking diamonds... we could be looking at a felony here. Maybe your son ripped you off. I've seen it a hundred times. In your world perhaps, not in ours. Are you in charge here? The Almighty is in charge. Um, Mr. Klausman... when was the last time that you saw your son? Tuesday night... right before Yaakov went to say Maariv. [ Ariel ] Maariv, that's the evening prayer. I should also tell you I'm Yaakov's best friend... and probably the last person to see him before he disappeared. Then you and I are gonna have to have a little talk. You will pardon me. I have people waiting to see me. No, no. You stay. - Um, would you excuse us? - It wouldn't be proper, us alone in the room. Why, are you planning on jumping my bones? It's a question of modesty, proper behavior. I was just kidding. I was kidding. Yes, of course. I got it. I got it. Okay? Here we go. All right, speak to me of Yaakov Klausman. [ Buzzing ] - Sholem alechem. - Alechem sholem. Hi. That's all the transactions for the past year... - to the public. - What do you mean? On the street, among ourselves, we do business with a handshake. - No written contracts? - It's a business based on honor and trust. Huh. What exactly does Yaakov do? Yaakov cuts the stones. He's fallen behind in his work what with his wedding and all. Oh. - What do you call those? - These? - Yeah, those. - Payess. Payess? Why do you wear 'em? It's in the Torah, the Bible. It's a law. You're not supposed to shave there. How come? Well, the Torah doesn't give us a reason. But the Rabbis teach us... in ancient times idol worshipers used to cut their hair in that area as part of their cult. We are forbidden to imitate them. Yeah, well, whatever. Shave, change of wardrobe and Yaakov's got himself a whole new life. - We already told you -- - Yeah, I know what you told me. But I got experience, okay? I know human nature. You will pardon me, but you do not know our nature. With all due respect, sir, inside every honest man... there is a thief trying to get out. You're positive? When you've seen what I've seen in this life, okay? - When you came here was the alarm on or off? - Off. - Is that typical? - No, not at all. We keep it on all the time. When somebody comes we switch it off, then we turn it right back on. - So Yaakov turned off the alarm because he knew who was coming? - Yes, I suppose. - And no one you've talked to saw Yaakov leave? - No one. Yeah, well, nobody just vanishes, especially if they're hauling a girl's best friend. Then again, maybe he never even left the building. I think it would be better to take Mr. and Mrs. Klausman out of here. - Dayan ha-emmes. - Omein. - Dayan ha-emmes. - Omein. [ Crowd Praying in Hebrew ] Eden, visitor. -What's new and exciting? -Your detective has been questioning me. Everything he asks-- He's making implications about Yaakov, things which are not possible. Oh. Well, you got any ideas? Any new information maybe? - No. - Oh. - So you wanna know what I see? - Certainly. Yaakov knew his killer. Yaakov let the killer in. - It's impossible. - Why? Yaakov would only let in someone he knew. Yaakov only knows Hassidim. - We don't kill each other. We don't kill anybody. - First time for everything. - You're wrong. - Don't say that. You wouldn't believe the things I've seen. So you keep telling us. You don't trust a female cop, do you? - Actually, the Kabbalah says that women are on a higher-- - The what? Kabbalah,Jewish mysticism. It's very intricate, very esoteric. It concerns itself with creation, transmigration, meditation -- I bet it's from California, right? Oh no, it was from before the beginning of time. Most of us don't study it because it presents great difficulty in areas -- The point? Yes, I'm sorry. Anyway, the Kabbalah says... that women are on a higher spiritual plane than men. Therefore, it would be foolish of me not to trust you. So you think this spiritual stuff is like required experience to catch a killer? Well, a higher spiritual plane implies sensitivity... which must be very important for a detective. Yeah. Yeah, we positively cultivate it. What I really wanted to tell you -- Yaakov was a special person. He... helped people. People came to us because they felt lost in the world and overwhelmed. He had patience and trust. Yaakov was my friend. We were practically brought up together. Would you like, um, a chocolate eclair? I think that's what it is. No, I can't. It's not kosher. Go ahead, cheat a little. I won't tell. - What, you never break the rules? - Of course not. Never ever? - No. - Wow. You guys got a lot of rules? Actually, there's 613 rules or commandments; 248 positive commandments and 365 negative ones. No shit. Guess you're not used to a woman like me, huh? Is anybody? - Let me give you a ride. - No, really, it's okay. What, we can't be alone? Right? A rule? [ Chuckling ] How about this? We roll the car windows down, right. That way all of Brooklyn will see us and so then we won't be alone. You know, Detective Eden, you have a fine mind. Not many people would have picked up on the subtle logic of the situation. - Like my mind, huh? - Yes, it's very impressive. - [ Chuckling ] - What? - Nothing. - What is it? - [ Clearing Throat ] I like your mind too. - Thank you. I need to live here among you. Somebody that you know, somebody who you trust is Yaakov's killer. The only way that I'm gonna catch this person is if I'm as close to you as he is. An unusual request. How many of you work in the diamond district? Many, many. Well, if they can get to one of you, then they can get to all of you. Do you understand what I'm saying? We are in danger. Every single one of you. This murder, it reeks inside job. Inside job? Someone familiar with Yaakov's every move... someone very close to him... someone who knew he was going to work... someone Yaakov trusted and let into the office. Leah? - Excuse me. - Oh, please. We are being very rude. Listen to me very carefully. While you are with us, you must respect our customs. My daughter will assist you... and my son. Leah, let me take that suitcase. Emily, no , I can manage. Is my outfit okay? My hair? It's very becoming. But I mean on the Hassidic scale of sexiness, how do I rate? Come on, you can be brutally honest with me. I can take it. Detective Eden, I want you to know something. We are not quaint or exotic. We are not cute little characters. - You are. - What? -Cute. -Please don't say things like that to me. It's not proper? - Please don't look at me like that. - Like what? - You know. - Sorry! [ Engine Starting ] [ Leah ] Emily, we have to pay our respects at the Klausmans. Come with us? [ Indistinct Chatter ] Sol zait brengn elft. It'll be all right, Duvid. - Sol zait brengn elft. - A sheinem dank. Mara, Yaakov loved you very much. - We all do. - It's not right. It's just not right. The mirrors are covered... because you're not supposed to be concerned with vanity when you're in mourning; and the rip in the cloth shows you're not concerned with looking attractive; and not wearing shoes is because in ancient times... leather shoes were a sign of wealth. And when somebody dies, Emily, we're no longer wealthy. Wow. What? I don't know. You people... you really care about each other. Of course. All you have to say is you're "ba'al teshuvah." - Ba'al teshuvah. - Good. It means one who has returned. After that, no more questions. Huh. Do you get a lot of these returnees? People look for spiritual nourishment. They come and they go. It's not so easy being Hassidic if you're not born into it. - Leah, can I ask you something? - Yes, please. What is it, the Rebbe? Is that like a Rabbi? It's more than a Rabbi. A Hassidic Rebbe is a great presence. He's kinda old to be your father, isn't he? The Rebbe adopted us. Our parents were killed in a car accident. What about the Rebbe's family? His wife and children died in the camps. - Camps? - The Rebbe was at Auschwitz. I can't believe what I said to him. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. - Why did you become a police... - Person? Person. My old man was a cop. So, you had no choice. Leah, I do what I want to, when I want to. I am an independent woman. Okay? - Spectacularly happy, I might add. - Of course. - What do you want to be when you grow up, Leah? - A wife, a mother. That's it? But, Emily, what could be more important? War! I gotta tell ya. I'm getting really sick of this game. Ah! How's the diamond gig? It's, um, it's different. - They like, weird? - No, they're not weird. They're nice people. Shit! They're very nice people. They got a lot of rules. You know those fringes the men wear at the bottom. They're called tzitzit. Now pay attention. This is important. This is from the Kabbalah. It's very mystical. It's numerology. Ariel told me all this stuff. - Who? - Ariel, he's the Rebbe's son. - No kiddin'. - Oh, come on. I'm like this untouchable "shiksa," okay? Come on. Come on! Anyway, this numerology thing. Now... every letter in the Hebrew alphabet has a numerical equivalent. The word "tzitzit" comes out to 600. But with all the knots in them it comes out to 613. It's very cool shit, I mean, stuff. War! - What about the doers? - Inside, definitely. - My contact with Hassids -- - Hassidim: one, Hassid; many, Hassidim. Excuse me. What little contact I've had, they are not doers. I know it. So you got any suggestions? I mean, this isn't exactly an exciting lifestyle I'm living. I look like an ad for Laura Ashley. It's funny, we been together on and off what, four years? Whole time, I never even knew what color your hair was. - You look, uh -- - What? Radiant... you look radiant, Emily. [ Sighing ] - So who's running the thing? - I don't know. It's over here. Can I help you? - What's new and exciting? - Holy smoke. - I thought you were like uh -- - Like a what? - Come on, Marden. - Like a lady. You still got a great ass, Eden. - I need a contact. - One of the Jewish cops. What about you, Levine? Yeah, I'm Jewish. Know what that means? I eat bagels on Sunday mornings. Besides, those people are a friggin' embarrassment. AJewish anti-Semite, that's very nice, Levine. - This is my case, Lou. - Okay. Levine rides shotgun. Why not Marden? Nothing personal, Eden. Just I got a wife, kids. - You're a cowboy. I don't want to hurt your feelings but -- - That's okay. Face it, Eden. We're destined for each other. In your dreams. I've done my time with enough cold-blooded bastards, okay? - I'm not looking for another one. - Too late, I'm already here. Hey, enough of this. We're supposed to be professionals. We gonna bicker or do some police work? [ Lou ] Okay. I think you look rather nice, Emily. Thanks, Tedford. Yeah, I think you look cherry. Now, why doesn't that sound like a compliment? Hey, you know what I heard about how they do it? - They do it through a sheet. - A sheet? They're so uptight about sex... they make a hole in a sheet and shtup away. [ Laughing ] I'll get back to you on that one. [ Ariel Knocking ] Breakfast. - You ready? - I'm ready. Sih yadaim kodesh. Baruch atah Adonai elohenu... melech ha-olam ha-motsi... lechem min ha-arets. [ Indistinct Chatter ] Mara. Mara! Sit here. Ariel, who 's the new lady who 's jo ined us? Ba'al teshuvah. Madonna? - Is that Madonna? - Who? You know, "Like a Virgin -- " I listen to Rabbinic lectures. That way my time isn't wasted. Okey-dokey. Okey-dokey, okey-dokey. Emily, what are you doing? What's going on? Um, listen, Mara, I have to trust you with something. I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop and I'm trying to nail the people that killed Yaakov. Oh, God. Thank God. - Somebody's gonna do something. - You have to keep this quiet. - Do you understand? - Yes, yes, of course. - Swear to me. - We're not allowed to swear. What are you allowed to do? Promise. I can make you a solemn promise. Okay. Sounds good. Emily, who are you looking for? Serious scumbags. Serious scumbags? [ Teakettle Whistling ] Emily! No! - Okay, now, why? - Well, when we were a desert tribe -- I want you to introduce me to as many people as possible. Yes, of course. What do I do if they start talking Jewish to me? - This is my friend, Emily. - Hello. Ba'al teshuvah. - They study all day? - Yes. Yassol. [ Leah ] So we bring them their lunch. Ariel. I'll get it. Emily, this is Mendel. The Rabbi's beautiful daughter. - How you doin', kid? - Fine. Thank you. - Who's she? - This is Emily. Listen, uh, it's an anniversary, me and my girl. Wanna get her somethin' nice, okay? Something very special. Something like, um -- I don't know. Maybe you could suggest somethin' to me? A watch? That's a nice gift. Ah, in fact, my brother's just finished restoring a beautiful one. - It's very special. - Hey, yo, Ariel! Ariel, the Patek Philippe you just finished? Thank you. - That was some mess, huh? - Mess? Yeah, that kid they found. Yaakov Klausman? That his name? Hey, uh, Emily, what do you say? - About what? - About the watch. - It's beautiful. - It's a shame. Should never have happened. Could never happen around us, never. You know why? We take care of the people we're in business with. Nobody fools around with us. Nobody. And we take care of our own. Follow what we're sayin'here? -I'm not sure. -We got our own security company, private. You pay once a month. We take care of everything. Nobody gets hurt. Everybody's safe. It's too late for the kid. - But -- - Can we think about it? A week-- We'll be back in a week. Don't let it go no longer than that. We don't want anybody else to get hurt. If you'd come to us sooner, that little Hebe might still be walkin' around. Murderers! Murderers! What kind of people are you? - What's the matter with you? - You're askin' for it. How much you want for the watch? $4,400. - You can do better than that. - Whatever you think is fair. Yeah? - Anthony and Christopher Baldessari. - Christopher Baldessari. They're outta Bay Ridge. They run a little book, a little payoff. Very fundamental scumbags. - You got it? - Every word on tape. They wax the Klausman kid. Now they're trying to sell protection. - We don't know that they waxed the Klausman kid. - Yet. - With a little luck we can get them on extortion. - Sounds good to me. How do you want to play it? We wait 'til they show again. When Leah hands over the money for the security system... we come down on them like Judgment Day. I need their jackets. Way ahead of ya. Look at this. Rap sheet as long as Ocean Parkway. - Call Oliver. I'll catch ya later. - Hey, Eden. Admit it. I'm an insanely great cop. I made those guys as soon as they hit the pavement. I pulled their sheets, right? You could do worse than me. Here's a quarter. Call someone who cares. The truth is we deserve each other. No commitments, no romantic hassles, no illusions. Tell me I'm wrong. Pop? Pop? Pop? Hey! You look different. What is it? - How are you, Pop? - Good, real good. Takin' it one day at a time. Come here, you. Ah! Still can't keep up with the old man, huh? Hey, Pop, you know Nick -- I know what it is. Your clothes! - That's what's different. - Like 'em? Ah, what do I know? You wanna go have dinner, get something to eat maybe? You should have called. I got my AA meeting in ten minutes. Right. Well, maybe after. Oh, I'm meetin' somebody after. So , what's new and exciting? - No. Um, Nick got hurt. - Nick? How? We were pattin' down some perps and one of'em stuck him with a blade. Jesus. He gonna be okay? - Yeah. - Thank God. - You get the guy? - Yeah. That's my little girl. Back in my day... cop gets hurt, they put him in some dump of a hospital. He either gets better or he don't. You had to be tough. Nowadays a cop gets a splinter, 6 o'clock news is flashing his picture. Mayor comes to visit, shake your hand. Police commissioner is all over ya, handing you citations for bravery. And before you know it, you're swimmin' in dough... because they're makin' a movie of the week about ya. You kids, you got it made. [ Clearing Throat ] What would you do if I bought it, Pop? What kind of a question is that? If I died, what would you do? You been drinkin'? Can't you just answer the question? What would you do? I don't know. I don't know. I'd make sure you got a full-ribbon funeral... departmental honors and all. The works. That's what I thought. What kind of craziness is this? I don't know. Are you okay? You can talk to me. [ Indistinct Chatter] [ Screaming ] [ Sobbing ] Help me! - Somebody. Help me! - What's the matter? [ Sobbing ] Two men jumped out of a car. They just started hitting me. Riboyne shel o'lem, vos ot heshen? We're here. Take her legs. Be careful. Come, come, quick! I got her. Come on. [ Sobbing ] [ Indistinct Chatter, Sobbing ] So I want a 24-hour patrol. Oliver, listen, I don't need an argument on this. Like you said, we've got 27,000 cops in this city. I'm sure that you can find the six that I need. Thank you. And I stopped and then... they jumped out of the car and just started hitting me. Um, did you see their faces? No, it happened so fast. - But the car -- - What about it? Once when Yaakov and I were walking, there was a car and I thought it was following us. I'm not 100% sure, but I think this may be the same one. Do you know what kind of a car? I don't know about cars. It was black, I think. Black? I wouldn't be surprised if it's one of the Baldessari's. - You think it's these men? - Could be. So they are the serious scumbags? Oy vei! - The Rebbe saved me, you know. - Really? I almost died. I treated my body like trash. I slept with men I didn't love. I took drugs. A little over a year ago, I was walking down the street. I think I was drunk or stoned. I actually don't remember. Suddenly I looked up... and there he was... the kindest eyes I'd ever seen. The Rebbe? Yaakov Klausman. He said to me... "You look lost." I said, "Yes, I am." He brought me here to see the Rebbe. I've been here ever since. Yaakov... I miss him. - [ Sighing ] - So? The brothers Baldessari, what do you got? They did business with the Klausman kid in a big way. They got receipts going back a year and a half. So, you can see where he'd trust 'em enough to buzz 'em in. The car matches Mara's description. Oh, listen to this. The word I got is, they get pulled in again... they're in deep shit with the old man. Let's take 'em in, Emily, huh? I'd love to have a private talk with those gorillas. Okay. Meantime, get a court order, okay? I wanna drop a tap on 'em. Just needs your signature. What do you want, a medal? Levine, listen, the next time I'm looking to get into something stupid and degrading... I'll give ya a call. I'm countin' on it. - Rebbe, do you have a moment? - What, Emily? A few days ago I said something pretty stupid to you. You said every man is a thief. Yeah. Well, that wasn't the stupid part. The stupid part was... about everything that I'd seen. Leah told me where you were during the war. And um, compared to you I haven't seen that much. Emily... you and I, we have a great deal in common. Did you know that? Don't insult yourself, Rebbe. We both are on intimate terms with evil. It does things to your soul, doesn't it? I wouldn't know about that. You have a soul, Emily. I've seen it. - Have a good Shabbes. - Shabbes? Ahhh! Oh God! Oh God! [ Screaming, Laughing ] These. Bemitsvotav vetsivanu lehafrish chalah. Let's mush it all together before we knead it. Baruch atah Adonai elohenu melech ha-olam... asher kidshanu bemitsvotav vetsivanu lehadlik ner shel Shabbes. - Good Shabbes. - Good Shabbes. Baruch atah Adonai mekadesh ha-Shabbes. [ Together] Omein. [ Indistinct Chatter] Ha-shem. God. So God's name will be sweet on your lips. [ Mara Laughing ] Leave it to Leah. - [ Laughing ] - [ Laughing ] Pardon me. Pardon me. Do you like white meat or... dark meat? Um, white. [ Laughing ] - L'chayim. - L'chayim. [ Indistinct Chatter] [ Clapping, Chanting ] ## [ Humming ] ##[ Singing In Yiddish ] ##[ Woman Singing ] Sha, sha, sha. Raboisei.! Mit grois simche... vil ich modier zein az mein zin, Ariel... iz mit mazel gevoren a chossen. - What did he say? - He's announced Ariel's betrothal. - His what? - Ariel's getting married. - Mazel tov! - [ Together] Mazel tov! [ Chanting ] Mazel tov! What are you doing out here? Thinking. I heard a noise. I didn't know what it was. You've got a gun? Yeah. Have you ever used it? Yes. You've killed people? I had to. Of, of course, I -- How did it make you feel? I don't know. You tell me. The Rabbis teach us that you're obligated to defend yourself. But they also teach us that when you kill one person... you annihilate an entire universe. Thank you. What's this? Uh, that's the Kabbalah. I like to keep it close to my heart. [ Giggling ] Will you read something? This. - Uh... uh, I don't think -- - What? You can't learn out of context. You need a lifetime of study. Well, I don't have a lifetime. Let's do the "Evelyn Wood" version. You know, Evelyn Wood, the -- Just read. "Therefore engage her in conversation... "that puts her heart and mind at ease. "Speak words which arouse her to passion... union, love, desire and -- " and what? "Eroticism." - You little devil. - No, you don't understand. Wait, now. So, you don't do it through a sheet? Wh-- What are you talking about? Never mind. Read... more. "Hurry not to arouse passion until her mood is ready; begin to love her; let her -- " What? What? Let her vaginal secreting take place first -- " - [ Giggling ] Very mystical. - It's -- The Rabbis have a deeper intent here, which is... that man and woman should be a holy union. Okey-dokey. The Kabbalah is filled with erotic imagery. Most of it's theoretical. "Vaginal secreting". It's very theoretical. So, who's the lucky girl? Her name is Shayna Singer. Maybe I should meet her and check her out. - Check her out for what? - You never know. She might be after your body instead of your mind. [ Sighing ] Actually, she lives in France. Her father's a great Rebbe in Paris. - Nice girl, huh? - I'm told that she is. You're told? Well, we've never actually met, face-to-face, that is. We've written, talked on the phone. -Yeah, that's different, letters, phone. - You don't understand. Did I say anything? You don't have to. I read it in your eyes. I love this. Your father, he knows... what my soul looks like and you read my eyes. Good night. You're actually gonna marry the first girl that your father tells you to? She's not the first girl. I said no to all the others. What's so special about this one? I believe she's my basherteh. Your what? Basherteh. It means destiny. - Rabbis teach us -- - Not the Kabbalah? This is just normal stuff that everybody knows. Everybody except me and the rest of the world. That's very sad. Anyway... the Rabbis teach us that... when God created the universe... he also created every soul that would ever exist. Then he made a match between every female... and every male soul. This way, when you meet your soul mate... you say she is my basherteh... or in your case you would say he is my bashert. My bashert. That's very good. - Question. - Please. How come people are always breaking up, getting divorced... -or they're stuck in lousy relationships? -It's very simple. They have not found their true bashert. You see, everything is predestined... but we still have the freedom of choice. And often we make the wrong choice. So, you're pretty sure this Shayna is your destiny? Yeah, I think -- I hope. I pray. What about love? Love? Yeah... passion, romance. Well, tell me about love, Detective Eden. I don't know. It's great, it's natural. So, where's your husband, your children? I got a hot flash! You can have love without a husband and children. Good night, Ariel. What about sex? - Sex? - Yeah, sex. Emily, I just read to you from the Kabbalah. Sex is sacred, it is a Mitzvah, one of the positive commandments. I have a flash for you. Sex is nice. Sex is nice? How would you know? I mean, outside of your little Jewish Kama Sutra -- The Rabbis teach us that a man or woman who is not married is only half a person. - Ariel, you can have sex without being married! - You can, we can't! - A rule? - Yeah, a big rule. - That's too bad. - Excuse me? You're missing a couple of life's greater moments. - Why are you so angry? - I am not angry. - Your lips get very tight when you're angry. - I am not angry. - Your voice gets very strident. - Maybe I'm a little irritated. Because I'm getting married? You should be happy for me. -I don't care. -You put a lot of effort into not caring. Because you're different! You could have another life! But I don't want another life! The Kabbalah says a man doesn't have to leave his house to find what he's looking for. Yeah, well, the Kabbalah obviously never figured on me! I see through you. I see right through you. You look at me when the others turn away. You look at me and you talk to me. This is totally -- Good night. Emily. Emily! I will be taking the Rebbe's place. Do you know what that means? I am the next Rebbe. Is that what you want? I want to be worthy. My father is a very great man. Yeah, but is it what you want? Ariel? [ Footsteps ] What is it? Nothing. Go back to sleep. Emily... not on Shabbes. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, it's fine. Don't worry. Just think of me as your guard dog. You know... you're my first non-Jewish friend. [ Chuckle ] I'm a shock, huh? Yes. But I also think you're wonderful. You're like one of the women in the Torah, Devorah or Yael. They're great warriors. Yeah, I'm a regular Joan of Arc. Who? Never mind. You're my first Hassidic friend. Come to think of it, you're my first female friend... since the third grade. - I can't believe that. - It's true. Emily? Ariel... is special. He was an "ilui". A what? A Talmudic genius when he was just six years old. He is to Jewish learning what Mozart was to music. And that's not all. Ariel has a great soul. We've always known it. Ariel... Ariel can look down at the sky. Yeah. [ Honking ] Just go over there, please. [ Indistinct Chatter] Emily? Mendel would like to know if you're interested in a shiddach. - I don't know, am I? - Don't you understand? He likes you. He thinks you're attractive. He would like to meet you and maybe get married. - I can't tell him who you are. - Leah... tell him whatever and I'll be gone before you know it. Emily is flattered. But -- But what? She's not ready. Oh. - You know what I think, Mendel? - What? I think Emily's making a big mistake. - Emily? - Stay. Stay put. So, what do you say? We don't want nobody else gettin' hurt, do we? Congratulations. You just bought yourself peace of mind. Yeah, you guys just bought yourselves a cage. - You're busted. - What? Put your paws on the counter. Levine, call for backup. [ Busy Signal ] We're gonna keep this just between us, right, guys, nice and easy? - Answer me. - We got a right to remain silent. Somehow I knew you were gonna say that. Open your jacket. [ Busy Signal ] Turn around. - We can't get pulled in again. - What was that? I said, "What's the charge?" Extortion, racketeering. That was Yaakov's... one of the three bags he had the night he was killed. - [ Man ] Precinct. - It's Levine. It's goin' down. I want backup. And with a little luck, conspiracy to commit murder... the murder of Yaakov Klausman. Let's go. - [ Ariel ] Emily.! - Get out of the way! - [ Indistinct Yelling ] - [ Levine ] Stay back.! Let's go! - [ Chris ] Get out of the way.! - Halt! [ Man ] What are you doin'? - Halt! - [ Tires Screeching ] Emily! [ Screeching ] [ Horn Honking ] Come on! - How bad? - It's my ankle. It's busted. Go! Levine, you are an insanely great cop! [ Honking, Sirens ] [ Sirens ] Oh, God! Oh,Jesus! Save me. We didn't kill that kid. We didn't kill nobody. We didn't kill that kid. I'm scared. I'm so scared. [ Fire Engine Sirens ] [ Nick Groaning ] What's new and exciting? Hey! Case over? Over. Sit down. - Why? - Please. What? Will you marry me? No. Will you live with me? I can't. Then I gotta ask you to stay away from me, 'cause... - I know I can't stay away from you. - Nick, listen -- No. Please, I gotta know. What am I to you? - You're my partner. - Stop sayin'that. It's -- It's not enough anymore. - Nick, not now. - No, now. Since I got hurt, things look all different to me. What we had was great... but I need more now. I never lied to you. Nope... never lied to me. I thought that we had an understanding. No, you had an understanding. You made the rules. That was fine. I wanted to be with you. It's just -- There's some things that I can't give, Nick. Can't or won't? What's the difference? ## [ Romantic ] [ Doorbell Ringing ] [ Sighs ] Ahem. We're alone. You're breaking a big rule. Yes, I know. Put something on, please. If you don't like it, leave. I like it. That's the problem. [ Ariel ] Who are they? [ Emily ] You gotta be kidding. You've never -- We don't watch television or go to the movies. [ Ariel ] They're so magical. Come here. Come here. See what you're missing? I was worried about you. You left without saying good-bye. My mother left my father without saying good-bye. [ Sighs ] You know why? She couldn't stand sleeping with a cop. She said it made him angry... and that he took it out on her. You think that's what's gonna happen to me... some guy telling me that I'm too angry... too hard? This is my life. It's pretty, isn't it? [ Crying ] My partner... he wants to change the rules on me. My father wants to... give me an inspector's funeral. And I want you to kiss me. I'm meeting her tonight. Who? My bride. You know, when I'm with you or with Leah... I'm not angry, Ariel, not angry at all. From the very beginning, you -- You made me feel soft on the inside. Emily... I can't. Can't or won't? There's no difference. - Emily. - Yes? I'm begging you. Okey-dokey. [ Water Running ] [ Emily Giggling ] [ Sighs ] - Emily, the reason I had to see you. - Yeah? The Baldessaris, they didn't kill Yaakov. Tony was dying. I don't believe he would lie. What if you were right from the very beginning? What if it is one of us... or someone pretending to be one of us? What was it that you called me? A ba'al -- - Ba'al teshuvah. - One who has returned. Like Mara? How did she know that there were three pouches? The only person who could have known had to be there... with Yaakov. He buzzes her in. He opens the door... and he finds himself face-to-face with Mara... and whoever she's working with. - It could have been anybody from her past. - When she was hurt-- - Would she have done that to herself? - Easily. When the Baldessaris came into the exchange... the pouch in Chris' coat, Mara planted it. They read about it in the newspaper, about the murder; - But -- - They tried to take advantage of the situation. Mara wanted me to take them out. With them dead, the case is closed. I'll miss you, Mara. I'll miss you too, Leah, you most of all. But I just can't stay here any longer. Too much has happened. Let me get my coat. [ Door Slamming ] [ Indistinct Chatter] Ah! [ Chuckling ] Sholem alechem. Alechem sholem. - [ Rebbe ] Comment ca va? - Quelle maison. - C'est jolie, non, maman? - C'est tres jolie, ma cherie. [ Indistinct Chatter] Phone Leah and warn her. - [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Men Chatting ] - Ariel, you've never used a gun, have you? - No . Hold it like this, aim at the heart and pull the trigger. Take this. It's my spare. She'll search me, not you. This is Eden. I need backup, corner of Forest and Putnam. Mara, take it easy. It's okay. Mara! Mara? Listen to me, please. - Just give it up. - No way! Just take it easy. Put the gun down. - Can we make a deal? - Make me an offer. I'll drop murder one... - settle for a deuce. - It's not good enough. Think again, Mara. How are you gonna get out? You're gonna have to go through me. Come on, let's cut a deal. Okey-dokey. Turn around. [ Scream ] What are you going to do now, Mara? Let Leah go. You can just walk out. I'm not going to stop you. Do you really want to kill Leah? She's been your best friend. - I was acting, playing a role! - Leah wasn't! I wasn't. Yaakov certainly wasn't. None of us were. You have a chance to escape. Take it. Aren't you gonna quote from your precious Kabbalah? The Kabbalah says that out of every evil action, there can be found some goodness. Please, Mara, let her go. - Ariel, help me! - Mara! [ Gun Clattering ] [ Sobbing ] Twenty-four hours of observation, you know that. I'm all right. I'm all right! [ Siren ] I was worried about you. - Were you really? - Emily... I think of you as a daughter. Thank you for everything. We have to go now. They told us not to stay too long. Rebbe... Emily? We're alone. You're breaking the rule again. The Kabbalah says -- The Kabbalah says -- Oh, Emily, I'm going to miss you so much. I beg your pardon. Are you all right? I know what you must be thinking. Do you? I know how it looks. If you want to leave, I understand. I will leave... but only if you want me to. [ Door Opening ] "God counts the tears of women." What? It's in the Kabbalah. It means that... women understand the world better than men do; Therefore, they weep more often. ## [ Yiddish ] ## [ Cantor Chanting "The Seven Wedding Blessings" ] Hey, Levine! Hey! - How's the leg? - It's no problem. - It's good. - Good. How you doing? - I'm good. - Good. - How are you doing? - I'm all right. Good. I got an idea. We could both use a little, uh, rest... and a little relaxation. Two weeks in Aruba. You come back a new woman, Emily. I already am. The question is, would you come back a new man? Two weeks with you, who knows? I might. That's very sweet, Levine, but no, thank you. Why not? I'm waiting for my bashert. - Your what? - My bashert. Bashert! What's that? Ask your Rabbi.
