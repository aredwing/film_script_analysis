Your mother said you were having a hard time. Yeah, I... er, I just broke up with my girlfriend. We went out from the end of high school till... well, through college. What did she do? She studied Marketing at school. She's got a job at an ad agency now. And you? Me? I, erm... I studied Neuroscience... with a primary focus on the relationship between the eye and the brain. My thesis project was about peripheral vision. It dealt with something called 'crowding' and 'size pooling'. How the width of one object is given a weighted average of the objects around it. The effect is called 'size pooling'. - It was published, actually. - Hm. That's great. I'm not sure I understand, but it's great you were published. Yeah, that's OK, nobody does. How long were you together? For almost 5 years. I moved in with her right after graduation. Things were... Well, they were nice for a while, but then she wasn't happy anymore... or I wasn't making her happy. She didn't like what she was doing. I tried to be supportive, encourage her not to settle. But then... I'm living at home now. Excuse me. I'm not feeling so well. I'm still feeling jetlagged. Do you understand "jetlagged?" Yeah. Don't worry. Do you still speak to each other? No. Not really. The way that it ended... She started coming home late from work... and one night she got into bed with me and I moved to hold her, and I just... smelled this smell on her. What do you mean? I'm sorry. Maybe it's a little inappropriate. No. Go ahead. I, er... I just smelled this guy on her. She smelled like sex. Like sweat and latex. And this guy, whoever he was, was all over her. I mean, she denied it, of course, but it was clear. I don't know, maybe I overreacted. Well, whatever. She's a whore. I'd like to meet somebody new. Hello? OK, thanks, I'll be right down. My cab is downstairs. - Can I help you with your bags? - No. Thank you. So, you know where everything is. Just change the sheets at the end... make sure the heater is off and the kitchen is clean. Yeah... yeah. And how long will you be away? Um... I'm going to the south. So maybe a week, maybe a month. I don't know, it depends. But you'll be here for a week? Or much longer? No. Just a week. I have to figure out where I'm going to next. Oh, right. Leave the key under the mat outside. I'm sorry I have to leave just when you arrive. That's OK. Don't worry. - Have a safe trip. - Thank you. - Give my love to your mom. - I will... I will. - Goodbye. - Ciao. # If the walls were too thin, you would...? 'Hey, Chelle belle... "Dear Michelle..." 'Hey, Michelle... How are you? 'How's everything? 'I know you said not to contact you. 'I know, the last time we spoke, we agreed not to contact each other. 'But I'm in Paris now, about to start traveling around for a few months. 'And since we always spoke about coming here together, 'I just thought I'd let you know. Things are great. 'So far, things are great. 'I'm spending time with our cousin Carlo and his friends. 'I... I met someone, actually. 'I wanted to tell you I'd met someone. 'I'm meeting some interesting people here and practicing my French. 'I miss you. 'I hope you're well and maybe we can speak soon? 'Maybe we can speak soon... 'Love... 'Yours... sincerely. 'Sincerely, Si.' Cunt! # There was a time...? Heaven has reached down to earth. And what does this tell us? That God has not forsaken us. That He is always watching over us. That He loves us. Through this sign, He has manifested His presence. He is telling us. You are not alone. Excuse me. Excuse me... Could I have a light, please? Yeah. Thanks, you're very nice. - OK? - Yeah. Yeah, thanks. - Are you taking the Mtro? - Of course. Do you...? - Do you both live in Paris, or not? - We actually live nearby. I'm sorry but... What did you say? We live right around here... in this neighborhood. Yes, OK, I understand. Me, I stay here for a few days but... then I leave soon for... I'm going... In fact, I leave... East, maybe... I'm sorry about my French. It's awful, I know. It's OK, don't worry. - What's your name? - What? - What? - Your name? Got a problem? What? Don't you say excuse me? He's not French... No, I... I'm sorry, sir. So he doesn't speak French? OK. So I'm apologize man. - Er, OK... - OK? No regret. OK, yeah. I'm sorry. You have tiny hands, man. Like a girl. OK... And why do you have two girls and I have none? OK, that's it, enough. - Look, man, I'm sorry... - Hold on! Why did you hide these sweethearts? - Please let go of me, sir! - Are you laughing at me? No! I am not fucking laughing at you! Damn it! - Sorry. - No, it's OK. Do you know what time it is? It's 10:05. We don't have time? Not much. No. I'm hungry. It was nice meeting you guys. - Bye. - Bye. - See you around, maybe? - Nice meeting you. Do you like natural woman? Fuck me... I'm very horny. Please write me what you like. Can you hear me now?

'Hi, Michelle. 'I haven't heard back from you in a while. 'Not sure if you're getting my emails or if you're ignoring me. 'I just wanted to see how you were. You could at least get back to me. 'There's nothing I could possibly do from here. 'I'm sending you my best. Simon.' Evening, sir. Excuse me, good evening. You speak English? - Yeah? - Yeah. One minute... Do you wanna see French pussy? Lap dance? Strip club? - No, that's OK, thanks. - Come on, my buddy... My friend... Wanna spend the evening with some pretty girls? What? A nice night with pretty girls. Interested? Right over there. What do you mean exactly? You go in, have a drink, look around... There are pretty girls to keep you company. And if you want more, if you want sex, that's possible too, OK? How much is it? 10 Euros for a drink... If you don't like it, you can leave. What do you think? It's a great souvenir of Paris. Trust me, I'm not a crook. Over there? Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Hi. - What's your name? My name's Simon. - Sabrina, nice to meet you. - You too. Will you have a drink with me? Yeah, but how much will that be? - 20 Euros. - 20? Thank you. Where are you from? Erm, New York. - New York City... Wow! - Yeah. I don't speak very well, English. I present my friend, it's no problem for you? - OK, sure. - Victoria, come here. - This is my friend Victoria. - Hi. Are you all set? No problem? - Sure. - OK, it's very good. I go in the bathroom and I come back, OK? - OK. - Bye. - Thank you. - You want to go in the back? - Erm, how much is that? - It's free. We just sit there, and that's all. - Yeah, OK. - Come on. You're very handsome. I'm not saying that just for work, I really think so. That's sweet. Thank you. See this girl? - Sabrina? - The one I was talking to... This girl, she doesn't need money - she wants money! Today she got three clients and I only got one. Normally, it's a trade, you know? If she has one client, I get the next one... and she gets the next one, and it's a deal. I treat her like a sister. If I have food, I share my food with her. If she's happy, I'm happy for her. But for her it's not about sharing. - And me? I need this money. - Yeah, I understand. So you're visiting Paris? Yeah. Yeah... - And you have a girlfriend? - No. What do you do? For now? Erm, nothing. I just finished school. I don't see you very well. I need to look at you closer. I have myopia. Oh, yeah? I studied eyes in college. - Really? - Yes. I studied the relationship between the brain and the eye. - You speak French very well. - No, that's not true. - Yes, you do. - I studied in high school, but it's bad. Do you want to make love? How much is that? If you say 150, I say OK. Some girls say "It's the price" and they won't go down... 200. With me, I can go down for 150. - 150...? - Yeah. I give half to my boss. If I make 50, I give him 25. OK. But, erm... with you, it's not like sleeping with an old fat, ugly man. You know? With you, I will like it. I, erm... I spent all my money at the bar. I only have a credit card. - You have a credit card? - Yeah. That's OK. You can give it to me. OK. Thank you. Nadia? Sorry. That's OK. Um, I have a scar. A scarf? No, a scar. S- C-A-R... 'scar'. - Oh. - Here, you know. - That's OK. - I just prefer to tell you. I prefer to say it before to people. How are you feeling? I feel good. Oops! Can I, er... Can I just look at you? Yes. - This is the scar. - It's OK. Can you turn around, please? Jesus! Oh, Jesus Christ! Fuck... - I'm sorry. - It's OK. I didn't wanna come. It's OK. As long as you're happy. Yeah... I'm happy. I'm happy. Thank you. Are you OK? - And you? - Yeah. What is that? It's a fox. My mother gave it to me. Look. Here. - It's a mess. - No... it's OK. Hold on... I have to take it off. It's better off. Take my number, if you like. Take my number, so we can see each other outside. It's the same price, but it's better. OK. I miss her. 'I know, honey. 'It's OK now. It's gonna get better.' Yeah. 'Have you talked to her? 'Si? 'Si, can you look at me? 'Hello? Hello!' No. I haven't talked to her. 'Well, I don't get that. 'If you still wanna make this work, 'maybe you should call her.' Hh-mm. I don't know. Yeah, I guess. I wasn't good to her. 'That's ridiculous. 'Everything you did for her... 'Look, do you still wanna be with her?' I don't know. 'Go meet a French girl. 'Meet an Italian girl. Meet somebody. 'Just stop being miserable. 'It's not healthy.' 'Si?' I'm not your girlfriend, you can say what you want. Yeah? OK. - Say, "Fuck me." - Fuck me. Say, "Fuck me." Fuck me. 'Hey, Simon. I'm happy to hear 'you've been traveling and doing well." 'I've been hesitant to write back to you because the way we left it. 'I thought it would be better for us to take some time apart, 'in every sense of the word. 'I don't know when you're coming back to the city. 'But when you do, please respect me and my space. The truth is that I don't think I know you, or that I'll ever really know you. 'I don't think you ever knew me. 'I've come to realize that in the past few months. 'I'm happy now. 'The last time we saw each other, you frightened me 'and I don't feel comfortable being around you any more. 'I wish you all the best. Sincerely, Michelle.' Really? I missed a party? No, it was great. I had it all to myself. What, like I don't need cash? Hi, girls! - How's it going? - Everybody's here. Where else would we be? Want a drag? Why you staring, eh? You got a problem? I was attacked in the street. Can I come in? Who did this to you? I was... I was attacked. These kids, they took all my stuff. Where? At this train station. I'm sorry. What do you want me to do? I'm working now. I... You don't have any friends? No, I... I just needed some help and I didn't know where else to go. Do you think I could just stay with you for a few minutes? No, not now. OK... If you want, we can meet in 2 hours in the bar called Le Caf au Rendezvous. On the left, at the corner. It's OK? Wh-when will you be there? When I finish work. In two hours. OK. - Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. So, where do you live? Erm, I... I don't. You don't know where you live? No... I was supposed to leave. - What? - I was supposed to leave tonight. And now you don't have a place to stay. No. Erm... Not for now. OK. So... do you wanna stay at my place? Is that OK? - Let's go. Should I pay for this? - Yeah, thanks. Thank you. Sit over there. - You have a nice place. - I rent it from an old lady. She's a bit lonely. Your parents... ...you can't call them for help? I don't really talk to my parents any more. But I'll try and figure something out tomorrow. Thank you. Fuck... It stings. - That it? - Yes. Do you have any other wounds? I'm sorry, what? Where... where else did they hurt you? I don't know. I'm not... I'm not sure. Let me see. What do you want? I can't sleep. Could you talk to me for a few minutes? About what? I don't know. Anything. - Is Victoria your real name? - Hmm. My name is Noura. - Nora? - Noura... Noura. How long have you worked at the bar? A few months. What did you do before? I was working in a supermarket outside Paris. Is that where you're from? Yeah. I lived there until I... I was divorced. You were married? Was it bad? He was very violent. He never let me go out. Once, I woke up in the middle of the night. I was pregnant. I had a baby boy inside me. My belly was so big. I woke up suddenly... and there was blood everywhere. And I walked into the kitchen. And my husband was there. He looked at me. I was covered in blood, it was everywhere. And before going to the hospital... ...he fucked me in the kitchen. Did you understand what I just said? I think so, yeah. You have a son. Thanks for being so nice to me. 'Hey, Mom. I'm in Prague and about to head to Sarajevo. 'I'm sorry I've been out of touch, my reception's awful out here. 'I'm feeling better than I have in a long time, so don't worry about me. 'I met somebody, by the way. I think you'd like her. 'She's not a bitch. Ha-ha. 'When I get back, I really wanna focus again 'and not be such a pain to you and Dad, moping around the house all the time. 'I feel good being out here and it was worth taking this trip. 'I think you'll be surprised by how focused I am when I get back. 'I love you. Send my best to Dad. 'Love... your fox, Si.' - Are you there? - Yeah. - Hey, how are you? - Bad day. What happened? I saw a client at a hotel. Very aggressive. But he left me some coke. Want a glass of wine? Yeah, sure. That'd be nice. You know... the night I came into the bar to say goodbye and I saw you with that other guy? Uh-huh? I know that I shouldn't have felt this way, but it made me feel really weird. Does it make you feel weird? I was working. Do you think people do what they do just because they like it and not because they have to? You know, most of these guys... If they would get hit by a car, I would not even care. W- w-what about their wives? I mean, do you ever think about their wives? No, I don't think about that. No... Well, I mean, think about it for a second, because... most of these guys, they are probably married, right? And if their wives knew about you, then... well, they'd be very upset. - It would ruin their lives. - Probably. And take the guy tonight, for instance. I mean, is he married? Yeah. He is. Does he have money? He does. Oh. OK, I mean, imagine this. Your phone... it doesn't have a camera. But, if it did, you'd take this and you'd put it right here. Go sit over there. And whatever happened in that room... you would have it. And then what? Er, and then... And then...? I mean, instead of taking a little money from a lot of men, you could take a lot of money from one. And it's so easy to use these guys. Do you mind if I change the music? No, go ahead. It was the one thing they didn't take. # When everybody leaves you lonely # And times are worse than sad # And the world is falling on your head # Just remember, for all you know # Good or bad, come what may # You're gonna live tomorrow # If you don't die today # It takes a muscle to fall in love # It takes a muscle to fall in love # It takes a muscle to fall in love # Now the fear got in me # Cutting me deep # That's where it's gonna stay # And never leave # Someone come and lay my worry # Someone come and kill...? I can't sleep. Are you OK? I was thinking about these guys. They have wives. They have money. I don't know where they live, but I have their numbers. OK. That's OK. We could figure that out. I got the phone. Take a look. I bought you a shirt. Thank you. - Do you like blue? - Yeah... I do. I love navy blue. It's got class. It's perfect. Thank you. Try it, like this. Hold on! It's not right. # There was a time when my world was filled with darkness # D-D-Darkness # And I stopped dreaming now I'm supposed to fill it up with something # Something, something Sorry, excuse me. Are you Jean? - Yes. - Did you see a girl tonight? What? You have the number for Victoria? Please send her a message with your email. Why? We have something to show you. Well. Let's see it now. Erm, no, I'm sorry. That's not possible. OK. I'm going to speak in French, do you understand? Yes, I understand. I'm a cop. Cop. Understand? Yes. That means that I could, if I wanted to... I can break your fucking head! Do you understand? Yes. If I fuck a whore, what's it to you, eh? Do you really have something, or are you just fucking with me? Cause if you do, I'll hurt you. Understand? I'm sorry. It's nothing. Forget it. No! Stop it. Stop. Stop. Want to see what it feels like? You're such a fucking pain! Hold on, let me show you. Turn around. Do you like that? - Yeah? - Yeah. Like that? OK, come here. Like that? Yeah, that's good. - Faster? - Yeah..! Oh, fuck. Fuck! Come here. You OK? - Yes. And you? - Yeah. Have I told you about the first time I saw a woman on the Boulevard? I walked down the Boulevard. My mother held my hand. We were going to Sacr Coeur. It was a Sunday. That day... I noticed a woman leaning against the side of a building. She was big. She was wearing a miniskirt, without stockings. She stared at me. She was beautiful. She stared at me. And with her finger, she gave me a sign like this. She was so close, I could smell her. At that time, I didn't know what the smell was. Now, I know. It was sex. When I was older I went back to find her, just to ask her, "What did you want with me?" You see? "What did you want to do with an 8-year-old boy?" Undress. Ren? Yeah. You have Victoria's number? Excuse me? There's something Victoria would like to show you. Please send her a message with your email. Why? So she can send you this video. I could also leave it in your mailbox. Wait, wait, wait... Ren? You're a kid. Is this it? - Do you have the film for me? - No, not now. It wasn't easy for me to get this money. I've got a wife, a kid, a home. - Yeah, I understand. - I have responsibilities. Yeah. Yeah... This isn't for me. This is for her. Is this it? Come on. Don't make a scene. Please. - I should buy you some shoes. - Yes. - Are you gonna hop on the Mtro? - Why? I think I'm just gonna walk from here. - Yes? - Yeah. - Here? - Yeah. There's a shop close by. - I'll see you in a few hours... OK? - OK. - Bye. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye. - Bye. Are you sure about how you're feeling? Look me in the eyes. So? Enough said. Want a drink? Just a coke, please. You'll come by again... - I hope so. - You won't forget us? Of course not. You're staying in Paris, I hope? No, no, I'm not leaving. No, one day at a time. Love's fleeting. Whatever it is, I'm much better right now. Here's to love! May you find love, too! Erm... Hey! Do you... remember me? Yes! Yes, I remember you. Yeah, um, Simon. You're... ...Marianne. Marianne. You live around here? Yes... What about you? - Yeah, um... - I thought you left Paris. I was gonna leave, but I liked it so much here that I decided to stick around for a little while. And... where are you living? I'm staying at a hotel nearby. Look. I'm gonna meet somebody right now, but can I call you? - Yeah. You want my number? - Yeah. - Do you have paper? - Yeah. Look. This is your fault. It's you who did this. What do I do? - What? - He didn't take the money. OK. Can I get you anything? Here, I have something for you. When I was a kid my mom gave me this pin because she said I reminded her of a little fox. Me... I always wanted to be a tiger. Oh, yeah? I always thought of myself as more of a lion. I always thought of myself as more of a lion. And what are you studying? French Literature. - Yeah? - Yeah. OK. What period? The Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Wow. And what are you studying? Er, I graduated, earlier this year actually. - But I was studying Neuroscience. - Mm? My focus was the relationship between the eye and the brain. My thesis project was about peripheral vision. It dealt with something called 'crowding' and 'size pooling'. How the width of one object is given a weighted average of the objects around it. It's called 'size pooling'. Anyway, it's boring, I know. - But it was published, actually. - Wow... And what are you doing in Paris? Honestly? Yeah. Absolutely nothing. I, er... I came here to do nothing at all for a little while. OK. - Do you mind if I ask you something? - No. I was curious about... your eyes... how they move like this. Yeah... - Erm, it comes from my father. - Uh-huh. And it is called "nystagmus." - Nystagmus. - Yeah. OK. I don't know what that would be in English. Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you. It's very... ...very charming, actually. Thank you. I'm OK. I mean it. It's very pretty. Thank you. - Simon? - Yeah, it's me. Where were you? I went to get us some food. Why were you gone for so long? Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry about that. I went for a walk. Are you OK? Listen. Tomorrow, I'm gonna need some money because I'd like to buy you something. Hm? What are you doing? Make love to me. Oh, no, no, no, no... 'Ren. Leave me a message after the beep.' Hey, Ren, it's me again. Listen. We didn't expect to have to call you again so soon, but... we need to talk about more money. I'm just gonna keep calling you until I reach you. And, er, OK... Thank you, goodbye. 'Ren. Leave me a...'

Jesus... I'm sorry. Who is it? Um, it's just my, er... my cousin who I've been staying with. What? No... I thought you were staying at a hotel. What? Yeah, you told me so. No... I was staying at a hotel when I first arrived. Now I'm staying with my cousin. But he keeps calling me... and, in case it's important, I should talk to him. Can you get the bill, maybe order me another coffee? - Yeah. - Thank you. Hey... Everything all right? 'Why didn't you come home last night?' I, er... I know. I'm sorry I stayed out late. 'Who are you with?' Just a friend. 'What friend?' Listen. I can't talk right now, but don't worry. I'll be home soon. - Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. It's just my parents, they were worried about me. They kept calling my cousin apparently. I haven't talked to them in a week. - But your parents are divorced. - What? You told me your parents are divorced. Yeah, they are divorced. I mean, my mother and my biological father. But my mother remarried. I have a step-dad. Oh... One second. - Hello, Ren? - 'No. Who is this?' - I'm sorry. Who's this? - 'Mathilde. 'Did you call Ren's phone earlier?' I... Yes, but can I please speak to Ren? 'No, you won't be able to speak to Ren.' - Excuse me, what did you say? - Ren's gone. 'Tell me why you were calling Ren's phone so many times.' Listen, now's not a good time for me. Can you please have Ren call me? Not now, sir! I'm sorry. This guy... Jesus! Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just having a bad day. It's fun having coffee with you! What? I'm just kidding. - What does that mean? - Nothing! I'm kidding. Jesus Christ! You know what, I'm sorry. I... - If you have to go, go. - I... I don't have any money. Can I get you back? Yeah. I had fun. OK, I'll call you. Excuse me. I got a call from a woman today. And I think that we need to leave. Where were you last night? Why didn't you come home? I told you. I was out. Listen. We need to go as soon as possible. You disgust me. Did you not hear what I just said? We need to go. Get the fuck out. You're a piece of shit. And you lie. - I don't understand when you speak French. - You're a liar. All right. I'm leaving. That's right, leave. You're pathetic. And take your money. Take it. I don't need your money. Look at yourself, look... You're a coward. You're not a man. You know, we get what we deserve. What the fuck are you talking about? I did this for you. You could use that money for your son. I never asked you for anything, Simon. I was doing just fine as I was. I called. What? You heard me. You called who? - What did you do? - I called her! Oh, you cunt. You're all fucking cunts. I love you. I love you. I do. I love you. You're crazy. You're a sick man. You're sick! Fucking bitch! Put your fucking arms down! Fuck. - Hey. - Hi. I'm sorry, I'm freezing. I was waiting outside for somebody to let me in. - I'm sorry about earlier. - Oh, that's OK. Are you OK? No, I'm... I don't feel well. I'm sorry, I, er... I didn't know where else to go. I just wanted to see you. Do you think I could stay with you guys for just a couple of days? Um... Erm... Would you come in and sit? I, erm... I'm sorry to interrupt. It would just be for a couple of days, until I figure out... ...where else to go. Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry, but I can't help you. You can't stay here. - OK... - Sorry... # Happy birthday to you # Happy birthday to you... # Happy birthday, Carlo # Happy birthday to you Thanks guys! Oh, shit. Carlo, someone's here to see you. What are you doing here? I'm sorry to interrupt, but... I didn't know anybody would be here. I just came to get my luggage. - Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. I met a girl. I was traveling light for a little while. - Oh, that's good. - Yeah. It's my birthday so I'm having a few friends here... - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Let me introduce you. He's the son of my mother's friend. Sort of my American cousin. - Hi. - Hi. You want to drink a glass? Do you mind if I take a shower? No... Please do. Excuse me. - Have a nice evening. - You, too. I was putting him up for a while and... He didn't stay long. 'Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice message system.' 'Hi, you've reached Mary. Please leave a message.' Mom? Mom... Mom! Mom... 'Michelle... 'I've spent a lot of time in the past couple of months 'reflecting on myself and our relationship. 'I've never cried as much as I have in that time about anything or anyone. 'I know now that the only way for either one of us to grow, especially me, 'is for us to have time apart. 'I became too nested and reliant on you. 'Emotionally and even financially, in a way - 'something I had never expected, or wanted. 'I know my behavior at times probably only made the atmosphere more toxic.
