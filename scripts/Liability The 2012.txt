A guy I know needs a driver. Okay. - Cool. - Interest you? Mmm. Why, what's he drive? Different jobs, different cars. His name's Roy. You'll meet him tomorrow morning at 6:00. - 6:00?! - There's always the septic tank. Okay, right. Yup. I'll be there. Good. Now listen, uh... Let's keep this to ourselves, eh? Just you and me.

Dominating the headlines this morning the story of another victim in what the press have dubbed "The Handyman Murders." Just north of Newcastle late last night... Anything else? Roy, yeah? That's the last time I wanna hear you say my name. Okay. What do I call you instead then? Ray? Nope. What's wrong with Ray? It's not your name. Ah. Ray, Roy-- It's too similar. Too easy. So how do I attract your attention? Well, it's just me and you in the car. I'll assume you're talking to me. Okay, so we go to the services for a bite to eat I see a truck nearly run you over. What do i call you then? Just shout, "OI." You want me to call you "OI"? No, okay, yeah. Roy, oi. Fair enough. Keys? Oh-ho. Right, I'm onto it. Come on, you fucking... You should've let me pick you one, man. Could've got you something much cooler than this thing. There we go. So where we off to? A14, A1. Okay, I'll just need a postcode. Let's get the sat-nav. A14 west, A1 north. I'll let you know when we get there. Do you mind if I stick the radio on, mate? Where is it? Police in Northumberland have released information regarding the discovery of a body on the A1. - Oh, the A1. Boom. - They believe the victim is linked to a string of murders that have been happening... - Uh, testing. - Which means? Which means we'll have to start talking like this, Pet! Which means cops. Oh yeah, 'cause of that, um... Handyman fella. It's all over the news, isn't it? What's that you're reading then? Ooh, a speech. Is that what you do then, is it? Make speeches? I fit kitchens. You're making a speech about fitting kitchens? It's a long journey, man. I'm just trying to make conversation. # Braggin' five, did he mention that he borrowed 10? # # Plus his whip is due back in at 9:00 a.m. # # And his chain and his girl's got a time on them # # Shine divided, aligned with the mirrors # # Multiplied was the light and the prism did the blinding # # Illusion was bright but his mind's not a diamond # # but mine is, I sight him, I couldn't wrong or right him # # I lie with the lions and he's sky-high and signed # # Defining a genre that's changing with time # # Declining a culture, its roots undermined # # I'd rather insult them than move with the tides # - # I'm rude with the mic... # - Oi! I can drive with them in. - Turn it off. - It's only music. - Wind your window down. - What? Wind your window down! You got that switched on, they know exactly where you are. - It was a birthday present. - Well, it's you or the phone. It's your choice. Okay. Can I keep the headphones? Stop here. - Do you need any backup? - Not to eat my lunch. - You want some? - Nah. Oh, go on then. Oh, man. - It's moldy! - It's cheese. I don't think I'll be out here again. Well, you never know with your job. No, I'm done. Retiring? My daughter's getting married. You know how much a wedding costs these days? I thought we might be on to something. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I always wanted to fit kitchens. Well, it all comes down to the same thing. Details. There's your D.N.A. I knew a guy once, he got hired on for a job. It should've been a simple job, but at a tense moment, he licked his lips. That's all it took. They got his D.N.A. from saliva on his ski mask. With that, they could put him at the job. And if they could put him at the job, then they could put other people at the job. - So that was that. - What, they did him in? What I'm saying is for a guy to get along in this world, he has to be very very careful. - Same goes with your dad. - No, he's not my dad. What do you call him then? The guy that screws your mom? Fuck. Ah! Are you gonna tell me what we're up to? - Right, you can stay here. - Oh, man. You keep an eye out. All right? If someone comes along, pretend you're walking your dog. - All right? Shout "Rover." - Rover? Yeah. What? It's just not very believable, Guy like me with a dog called Rover. All right, you choose a name. Psycho. Psycho. Yeah, mate of mine in sinfin calls his staff that. It's a detail. Right. Right. You just keep a lookout. Shit! You ain't gonna do much damage with that, are ya? Mr. Eglitis? I appreciate that you're scared. - Do not come in! - Right. I'm gonna put something through the door. - I'm Newcastle police. - It's not me you want! We know your life's been threatened. We think you might be #4, Danil. Can I call you Danil? That's why I'm here. We want to take you into protective custody. Why don't you come out and talk to me? You all right? Are we good? Can I stand up now? Now the car is parked up there on the track. Do wanna walk with me, or do you wanna wait here and I'll go fetch it? I'll walk. - Psycho! - You're not cop. Psycho! Oh! - How many? - Eh? - How many were there? - Uh... - You did see someone, right? - I thought so. Get the car. - Are you gonna do him in? - Get the fucking car! Hey, sorry about the false alarm. It's all right. It's probably better to be a little bit further off the track. Give us a go? "Give us a go"? Yeah, when ya... Can I... Could be the only chance I ever get. - Here. - What about the gun? - He doesn't use one. - He does. Did. No. no, not him. You cut it off, right? You cut it off right here. - You? - Me what? - You're the handyman? - What? No! No, no, no, no, no. No no, He's supposed to look like just another victim, you know, so it doesn't get traced back to me. So just here. All right? On you go. See on his hand? Look, it says "Mate." No, it doesn't say "Mate." It says "Mom" and "Dad" in Latvian. - Latvian? - That's what they speak in Latvia. Are you gonna do this or what? Try not to look in his eyes, so you don't identify with him. Well, it's a bit odd not to. Well... Think... Of something that you hate. Something that you hate so much that you'd be willing to kill it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, up a bit. Up a bit, up a bit. Right. right there. Bang on. Oh, man, what's that? Oh! Muscles relax when you die. - So he shat himself? - Yeah, I must've hit him too hard. Still... - Job done, eh? - No, no, no, here. The wounds aren't supposed to be postmortem. Oh! Not on the ground. Oh, man. Here ya are. - Huh? - Grab this. Oh, fuck. Why don't you go and keep an eye out? Just like before. Not in that outfit! Oh, yeah. Sick bastard. Right. Good afternoon, darling. It's not as ugly as it looks. Deer in these forests are protected, so you gotta butcher them on the spot. And what with the roads around here-- They don't always get where they're going, - Especially the older ones. - Mmm. We're just trying to make a living, really. Restaurants around here, they pay 10 quid a kilo, Some of 'em. So I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We're gonna pack up and you're gonna go on your way.

Do what? - For fuck's sake! - No, stay down. God. Have you seen a red car go by here, fast? Yeah. Bastard hit my son. He didn't even stop. Oh, my god. is he okay? He's never really been okay. - Could you get in the back? - Eh? In the back. Go on. In you go. You all right to drive? Uh-huh. Fucking hell. There's no rush. - Other way. - Huh? They just passed her. Other way. Well, which way now? - Do you have a phone? - In my bag. All right, out you get. What the fuck are you waiting for? - So how do we know which way she went? - We don't.

I'll meet you out front. # I hope you're feeling the scene # # Like everyone has picked up their prize # # When it's just you and the beat # # 'Cause I can't even get out of my bed # # But if you wanna go now # Oh baby, don't you go, in the night I told you # # You say you wanna go and the one who told you # # You tumble out of bed, they're the one who told you # # You say you wanna go, in the night I told you # # You tumble out of bed, they're the one who told you... # Wha-- hey!
