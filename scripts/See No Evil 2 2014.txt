Burn victim, huh? - Yeah. - Huh. - That has gotta be the worst way to go. - Yeah. - Would you like the honors? - Oh, well, you are too kind. You can take off now if you want to. Hey. I got 10 minutes left, okay? - Stop trying to get rid of me. - Believe me, I'm not. You're more than welcome to stay all night if you want. Not that you would want to stay all night. I'm sure you have plans. I'm just meeting some friends for drinks. I mean, it's nothing special. Oh, yes, that's right. It's, uh... it's your birthday. Yeah. It is my birthday. Actually, in two hours, it is my birthday. Hey, you should take a look at this before you take off. - Why? What is it? - It's crazy. Seriously, I've never seen anything like it before in my life. And I have seen some pretty crazy things come through here. Okay. Ready? Yeah. I'm ready. - Happy birthday. - Oh, my God. Oh! My God, that's so, so sweet. It was nothing. This is not nothing. Really, I mean, you should come tonight. I'd love for you to meet my friends. I-I'd love to, but I'm, uh... I'm working the graveyard. I'm pretty sure that Holden would kill me if I took a leave of absence. Told analysts and investors... it's an even wider than expected loss in the second quarter. Cake! Finally! - Hey! Were you in on this too? - Of course I was. - Aw. - Happy birthday, babe! Aw, thank you. Not that I would forget it was your birthday. Seth hasn't shut up about it for the last month. Two months, Professor X. Two months. Professor X. I like that. You're lucky I'm stuck in this chair... or my boot would be halfway up your smart ass by now. Oh, yeah? Who told you I was into that kind of thing? Hey! You two stop flirting. Go get a room already. All right. And on that note, you are done. Are you sure you two will be able to cope without me? Yes. Get out of here. Go make some bad decisions. - Hey, can I get my phone, please? - Yeah. - There you go. - Oh, thanks. Breaking news of what police are referring to as a series of brutal murders... at the derelict Blackwell Hotel... - involving a group of youth offenders. - Yeah? Nine fresh bodies. Police reports now indicate that dozens more in various stages of decay... are being found throughout the building. That could bring the death toll up to a few dozen. These murders look to be linked to a series of murders... Yeah, we're watching it right now. In an ongoing investigation into the God's Hand killer... Okay, will do. Which is in direct reference to the religious articles found at the scene. Well, there goes our quiet night. - How many bodies? - Nine. Decomps don't need to be pieced together to I.D. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna stay and help you guys out. No, no, no. It's your birthday. Go out and celebrate. No! I'm more of a cake and cadavers kind of gal. - Mmm. - I'm just gonna make a quick call though. Come on, Tamara. Yeah, right about now I wish I was writing a book about you asking her out. - I'm gonna ask. Okay? - Right. And I'm gonna get feeling back in my legs. Hey, it's Tamara. You know the drill. Hey, Tam, it's Amy. Okay, don't freak out, but I'm gonna have to take a rain check on tonight. Ooh, look at that. Ooh. - Knock it off. She's gonna hear you. - Oh, look at that. Look at that. - Stop, she's gonna hear you. - Hear what? This? Stop, stop! Don't be a dick. - Stop! - Amy, put it in. Amy, put it in. - I swear I will shank you with this. - Wanna borrow my chair? But it's going to be pandemonium here. - You gonna feel this? - Do it. Do it. - I'll do it. - Here she comes. - What are you guys doing? - Nothing. - Liar. Here. - Yeah. No problem. All right, let's get to work. All right. All right. - Let's do this. - After you. Clear! - We're losing him. - Clear! - Again! - Clear! Do we really want to save this guy? Clear! He's gone. You know, I really appreciate you staying and helping. Don't worry about it. We'll get it done twice as fast. This is the last one. We've got a Jacob Goodnight. Hey, this is the psycho that did it. All right. Shoot! Shoot, shoot. Scared me. - Hey! - Uh, I'll take the stairs. No, no. Aah! Oh, God. Come on. Seth? Seth? Boo! You're such an asshole. - You're gonna get your butt kicked. - No, come on. I'm unscareable. - Oh-ho-ho! Really? - Mm-hmm. - We'll see about that. - You can try your hardest. - It ain't gonna happen. - Oh. All right. Good. Seven feet. - Oh, my God. - Oh, Jesus. - Oh, Jesus. - Aah! Here. Here. Uh, it's a... it's a death rattle. You'd think he'd have bought me dinner first. Why don't you let me finish up here? You've done enough for today. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. Just save me some cake. Okay. But I'm not making any promises. Amy. Holden? Are you in here? Holden, are you calling me? Holden? Hello? Surprise! You guys, seriously? - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday! If Amy can't come to the party, then the party shall come to Amy. Oh, my God. Awesome. You're already drunk. No, I... Why would you say that? Yes! Seriously, I could lose my job over this! - How did you guys get in here? - Happy birthday, Amy. There he is, our fellow conspirator. Hey! We can't have Twitter trending photos of dead bodies tonight. Oh, you guys! Yeah, you can't smoke in here. - Why? - You just can't. There's too much flammable liquids. Well, well, well. I did not expect to see you here. You didn't think I'd miss my sister's birthday, did you? - Plus, Kayla insisted. - Ah. Oh, well, in that case, I guess you can stay. Although I did expect it to be in a bar, not in a morgue, but... Yeah, well... Let me guess. Tamara's idea? What? No! I'm just saying that I'm living your dream job. I know. - Hey. Hi, Seth. - Hey. It looks like I made it to your birthday party after all. You did. Let me introduce you around. I want you to meet my friends. - This is Carter. - Hey. - Kayla. - Hi. - Hello. - Oh, my gosh! This is our bartender, Tamara. And that's Will. - That's my brother. - Oh. So, are my eyes fooling me, or are you standing around without a drink? No, no, I shouldn't. I got some more work... No, you should. Just one. Just one. No, you can have two. - All right, I'll have one. - Well, cheers! - Cheers, guys. - Cheers! - Happy birthday! - Happy birthday! - Cheers! - Cheers! All right, let's get this party started, yo! Yes! - Do the white man dance! - Oh, yeah! She likes you. - Excuse me? - My sister. She likes you. Yeah, you know, we just work together. Right. Hey, man, look. Look, I'm not trying to be a jerk here. But look, I don't want to see her waste her life... working the graveyard shift at the city morgue. Okay? She's better than this. She deserves better. All right? She deserves more. She deserves someone who can offer her more. Sure. Yeah, absolutely. I gotta get back to work. Tamara's always in charge of drinks. That's all Tamara does. Here. Drink. Oh, gosh, my feet are sore. Mmm. Hmm. Hey. So tell me, what exactly happened today? It's trending on Twitter that some guy went totally postal across town. Baby, you promised in the car. No, it's... it's cool, yeah. It's something else really. My girl is somewhat of a connoisseur of psychopathic behavior. She's been online all night learning everything she can about this guy. Interesting. Yeah. - It is interesting. - Uh-huh. You'll have to ask Seth or Amy about it. They just brought in the bodies. Bodies? Oh. Like how many dead? Unknown. But nine ended up here. They got the killer though, right? Oh, yeah. Sure did. Yeah, we got him on ice downstairs. Mmm. That's good. That's good they got him. He won't hurt anybody else. Oh, well. Anyway... Baby, don't get too excited. Oh, I am very excited. - I want to see him. - Okay. - I want to see him. - Okay, okay. Let's go. Don't squeeze me like that. I have to pee. That just goes right through me. Where's the little girls room? - It's down the hall and to the left. - Okay. I'm gonna go with her and make sure she doesn't get lost. Hey. What did you say to Seth? We were just talking. Yeah, I don't need the whole I'm-a-concerned-brother routine. I'm just looking out for you. That's the problem, Will. I don't need you to. Okay? I can look out for myself. Christ, Amy, you dropped out of med school for this. You should be saving lives, not dealing with dead bodies. What? What are you... What is this? Huh? What, do you think I owe something to the world? I owe something to you? I owe something to Mom? No. No, I don't. Okay? You owe it to yourself for always taking the easy way out. I am taking the easy way out because I chose a career... that you and her just don't approve of? I like my job! I do. I like my life. I know that you guys think that you know what's best for me. But it has always been me taking care of me. And you, of all people, you know that. Happy fucking birthday. Amy. Amy! - Amy. - Will, just... Don't. Just ease off. I just wish she'd listen to me once in a while. Neither of you guys listen to each other. At least you outgrew her. She can't beat you up now. That's how we talk to each other. Well, cheers. No. You have to look the person in the eye. I mean, otherwise it's seven years of bad sex. - Cheers. - Cheers. Much better. Experts say that serial killers... are triggered by, like, some kind of chromosomal abnormality... that starts to express itself during... Whoa. Puberty, I think. "She deserves someone who can offer her more." - No, wait. - Oh, Yeah. Look what we have here. - I don't know about this. - Mm-mm-mmm. - Fuck. - I do. Just shut up. I will totally make this worth your while. That's so inappropriate! Oh, my God. Who do you think this is, huh? Huh? Who do you think this is? Hello. Is it? Is it? Oh! It is! It's him! This is him! This is him! I saw him on the news! Jacob Goodnight. I really don't think this is a good idea. Oh, really? What about this? This is probably not a good idea either. Right? This is probably a terrible idea. He killed, like, eight people. Uh-huh. Why'd you do it, big boy? Huh? Did Mommy make you do it? - Baby. - Yeah? Please get off the dead guy. I mean it. You know his mom... Margaret, I think. She was this weird fundamentalist religious nut. Was all obsessed with, like, sin... and punishment. And not like in the fun way. In the fun way. That is just disturbing. She used to keep him in a cage and, like, ceremoniously torture him. That's mean. I'm sorry. Hmm? You're dead? Oh. Tamara! What the fuck are you doing? What? God! Are you jealous? Oh, my God, you're jealous. You shouldn't be jealous... of that. Of him. He's all cold. Blah. Cold. You're hot. - Mm-hmm. - Hot. Cold. Hot. Hot. Hot. Hot, hot, hot. Hot. Hot. Hot, hot. Hot. Hot. Hot. Uh-huh. - That's pretty bad. - What? I am totally keeping pace with you. Yeah, well, it's a marathon. It's not a sprint. That sounds like loser talk... from someone who can't keep up with a girl. Are you cheered up now? Yeah. Yeah, I'm cool. I just... I worry about her. She's my sister. I think it's sweet that you care so much. Kayla, come on. Don't. It's fine. I'm... I'm gonna go find Amy before I make a bigger fool of myself. Come on. You don't even know this place. You're just gonna get lost. - Why not? - What? Why don't you like me? I like you. But... You're like a sister to me. Yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah Baby, baby, get your ride - Yeah! Yeah! Yes! Yeah! - Come on. Come on! Oh! Yes! Oh! Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh! Oh! That's it! That's it! - Come on! - Yes! Yes! - Right! - Yeah! This is it! Oh! - Jacob? - I'll be anyone you want me to be! Jacob? No, no, no, look. Where's the body? - What? - Shut up! It's just the guys messing around. No, no, no. No, no, wait. Hang on. How could they move the body? How could they move the body? I don't know. - Shit! - Shit. Okay. Listen, take my hand. Don't let go. Okay? There's the door. I see light coming through. - Someone's just being a dick. - Okay. If someone's just being a dick... why are you whispering? - What? - What? Ow! Shit! Guys? You down here? - Okay, let's go. - Okay. Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Shh. Shh. Did you hear that? Once your soul's clean, you'll be the hand of God. I see that! I see what you're doing. What are you doing? Let go! Ungrateful bastard! You hear me? Don't you see the sin? I s... I see it. Oh, man, I'm sorry. I see... it! Please! Please! No, man! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I m sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! All right? Please! Please! Let me go! - Please let me go! - I see it! Oh! No! Oh! You guys! No! Oh, God! This is bad! This is so bad! This is so bad! You guys! You guys! What the hell? - Hold on. - What? - I heard a scream. - Oh, did you? Oh. I didn't hear anything. Oh, God. Tamara. She's just messing around, right? We should check it out. Seriously? - What? - I don't know. I panicked, and then I just attacked him. Oh, my God, Kayla. Really tactful. I know. But it still counts as progress though, right? Any of you jokers down here? Look, I'm not gonna do this all night! Help! Help! Help! No! No! - That doesn't sound like messing around. - That came from downstairs. Come on. This way. Where did the body go? - What body? - The... - Jacob Goodnight. - Jacob who? The guy who killed everyone at the Blackwell Hotel. Hey. Gross! Oh, my God! What the heck? That sucks less. My God! Who did that to Carter? Where's Tamara? - Oh, my... Oh, my God! - When was the last time you saw her? I don't know! She left with Carter! Okay, the first thing we need to do is call the cops. But our phones are locked in the office! - Oh, God! - Okay! Calm down! Give me your... Give me your lighter. - Here you go. - Thank you. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. We have to find them. Come on. Let's go. Okay, guys, quiet. Give me a break. Hey, guys? Amy? Holden? Amy's friends? It's not working! What do we do now? Okay, we're here. We need to take the stairwell here. Is that the only way out? What if whoever did that to Carter is up there? The stairs are the only way. We head up now, we can be out of here in 10 minutes flat. - No! - Amy, no, wait! Amy! Wait! What is that? - Amy, don't go over there. - Shh! No. Oh, my God! Okay. Okay. Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I don't know what to do. Amy. Oh, God. I'm sorry. I don't know what to do. Let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go this way. Christ! Who's there? Oh, my God. Hey! Oh, my God! Come here. Come here. It's okay. Are you bleeding? You're bleeding! It's not my blood. It's Carter's! You're gonna be okay. We're gonna stick together. No! He's dead! He killed him! - Who? - Jacob. Jacob. Jacob Goodnight! No. No way. - Jacob Goodnight is dead. - No! It was him! - He's a goddamn corpse! - It was him! Jacob Goodnight is not dead. He's not dead. He's not dead anymore. He probably faked it so he wouldn't have to get locked up. I don't know. He's in here now, and we really pissed him off. Whoa, whoa. What do you mean, "We pissed him off?" I thought he was dead. Tamara, what did you do? He got up while Carter and I were, you know... Oh, my God! Are you kidding me? You did it in the morgue? I thought he was dead! Shh! Uh, have you s... have you seen Seth? No. No. No. We have to go find him. Oh! Oh! Where's... wheelchair guy? Holden... Uh, Holden's dead. Oh, God. Oh, God. Please tell me you know how to get out of here. Yeah. It's just a little bit further. Come on. Oh, man. What the hell? What the hell? Come on. This way. - Stupid door! - Now what are we gonna do? It's a security door, Will. That's not gonna work. Is there another way out? - Oh, my God! We're trapped! - I don't want to do this. Hold on. Let me think! Amy! - Open the door! - Open it! Open the door, Seth! Come on, come on, come on! You okay? - Why are you locking the door? - Jacob Goodnight is alive! He killed Holden and Carter. No! - Let's go! - Go, go, go! Amy! Come on! Let's go! This way. - Here. - Okay. - Let's go! - Go! Come on! Slow down! Guys? Amy? Will? Somebody? Please. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my... Shit. - You know where you're going, right? - Yeah. Usually. Look, just stay close. Nothing ever good comes of splitting up. - Let's go. In here. - Will, slow down. - Amy, get in here! - What? Why? No! No! No! Great, Will! Now we lost everybody. It's not my fault your friends can't keep up! - He's out there! - So are my friends! And if they have any sense, they'll hide, like us. You are so selfish. I've seen you pull some pretty low crap... but I don't even know who you are right now. Because I don't want to just charge out... when there's some mass murderer hanging out? Think about it. I'm not letting him kill you. Please. Someone help me. Help me. Oh, my gosh. - Shit. Okay. - Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. It's locked. It's locked, it's locked, it's locked. Okay. Wait! Wait! And he's told you what to do. Are you insane? This is not what God wants. Don't you see it? Open your eyes and wash the sins out. I can't. I won't! Oh, thank God. That's the voice of God. And he's told you what to do. Why would God... help you? Touch her. This is how to touch her. Once your soul is clean, you'll be the hand of God. Touch her. You're a dirty whore! No. No. Look at her. Haven't you learned anything? Do you see the evil in her eyes? Don't you see the sin? Please. I see the sin on you. - Please. - I see it. This place is a goddamn maze. This way. Come on. This will lead us to the east stairwell. - Really? - Yeah. Okay, you need to get out. Okay? And I need to find the others. What? No. Wait, wait! No, Seth. You have to come with me. You have to. We'll go out, call the cops. They'll come back and take this guy out. No! I can't live with myself if something happens to her. Okay? You get help. Oh, shit. Shit! Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, he's really mad. Oh, he's really mad! Oh, my God! - He's really mad. - Come on. Come on. Shit! - Don't you have the keys? - No! Not to this area. Okay. Well... Sorry. Here. Here! Come on! Come on! Go! Go, go, go! Shit. We're stuck. - We're stuck in here! - Hide here. - It's a terrible hiding spot. - Shh. Okay, I'm gonna be right over there. No! No! Don't leave me here. Please. I'm not gonna leave you. I promise. Okay. Shh! I'll be right there. Just hide. Okay. - Shh. - Shh. Shh. Hey. Hey. Shh-shh-shh. Oh, shit. Okay, we need to do something! There's nothing we can do about it! You are such a prick! Hey! Amy. Go! Run! Run! Amy! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Go! Let's go! Come on! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Oh, no!

He's still alive. - I have to go back! - No! No, Amy! He's gonna kill us both! No. I'm not running anymore. I'm not leaving my brother. - Well, you're not going alone. - Come on! Are you sure about this? I could still hear him. Oh, God. Come on. He's still alive. Amy, slow down. Slow. On three, okay? Okay, one... two... three. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Shit. Oh, come on. Son of a bitch! Come on. That doesn't help much. Come on. Okay, I got it. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Hey! Are you ready? Yeah. Amy! Amy! Okay. Okay. We're gonna get you out of this. - Run! - What? Run! Run! Run! Oh, Will! No! You bastard! He's my brother! Amy! Amy, go! - Let's go! - Hurry! - Let me see it! - I'll live. But we gotta get out of here. - Let me see! - We've got no time! - We gotta go! - Come on! Damn it. Give me your keys. Hold on. Come on. Seth, come on! Shit. Okay. All right. - Give me the keys. - Here. Be careful! Come on. Go. I don't see him. Amy. Hey. Oh, hey, I'm sorry. They're all dead. Yeah, but we're alive. And we can make it. We can get out of here. But I need you to be strong for me, like I know you are. Okay? We are gonna get out of here alive. Hey. I'm not gonna leave you. We just keep moving. Okay. Shit. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Is it the right key? I don't know. They're all starting to look the same to me. - It's the wrong one. - It should be the right one. Come on, come on. Okay. - Son of a bitch! - Hurry. Hurry! - Piece of crap! Come on! - Damn it! Come on! Come on! Lock it! Lock it up! Run! Oh, God! Hey. If we have to run, can you? Potentially. Okay. Listen to me. Get up here. If I don't do this now... you are gonna bleed out. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna cauterize the wound. I'm not gonna lie to you. This is really gonna hurt. No, lie to me. Please. Do you have your wallet on you? Yeah. I'm down to my... last five bucks. Five bucks. How were you planning on taking me out on a date? Well... Well, I mean, I... I thought that I... - Son of a bitch! - Sorry. Shall we? - You know what you're doing, right? - Yes. I do. I wanted to be a doctor before I dropped out. Why did you drop out? If you don't mind me asking. Because we all end up here. No matter what you do. We all die. Sorry. - Aah! - All right. Bite on this. Move back. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay, it's done. It's done. You all right? Oh, God. Well, I'm gonna thank you for that? Seth, look. Oh, Jesus! Come on! Amy. - You go get the cops. - No! We're both gonna go! Amy, I can't fit through there. No! - Do you have your car keys? - No. They're in Holden's office. Look. You take my keys, okay? When you get out, you go and get help. - No, I'm... - It's not open for debate. Okay? It's our only chance to get out of here. Okay? I'm parked out front. The crappy blue thing? Yeah, the crappy blue thing. Goddamn. Hey. - Are you okay? - Yeah. He's out there. - Did he see you? - I don't know. He's going back up to the cars. Yeah, of course he is. I should have parked around the side today. Side. - Seth, we can get out on the side. - What? Come on. Amy? Amy? Amy! Amy, no, no! No, no, no! No, you're okay! Hey! Hey! Stay with me! Hey! Hey! Amy!
