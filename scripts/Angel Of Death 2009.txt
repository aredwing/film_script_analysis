I've got the perfect person for this job. What was that? Work. You're up tomorrow. Good. I'm tired of sitting on my ass, anyway. Take the new guy again. Franklin? I'll pass. You're gonna need someone on this job. Yeah, not him. He's a kid. Look, the bosses say they want him working. They see big things in his future. - Big things like what? - Eve, just do it for me. That's good. For you? What, are we pretending this is a relationship now? Oh, no, no. It just sounds nicer than ordering you... but I can do that too. Fine. Whatever, Graham. You're still using the service elevator, right? So, what did this guy do? That's not a question you ask. What is it with you and these zip ties, anyways? People escape from handcuffs, not from that. Can you kill somebody with this? If I have to. So this Anderton guy. He's just some businessman. What if he trademarked the cure to cancer... and some drug company isn't thrilled? - What if it's something like that? - Then it's something like that. - Okay. - Listen to me. Questions will get your name in a folder like that. It doesn't matter how his name came up, it just did. Does it ever get to you? You know, the killing? Nope. Okay, they're all gone. Get to work. I'm gonna be in and out in 5 minutes. - You know where to be? - Yeah, yeah. Back of the stairs in the alley. Don't pussy out on me, Franklin. You're my ride home. Oh, shit. I'm sorry, ma'am. This is a private floor. Oh, I'm sorry. Could you just get back on the elevator, please? Come on, move. - Please leave a message. - Damn it, you. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Eve. Jesus Christ. Drive. Drive. - Goddamn it. - Doc, come on. Damn it, Eve. Don't move. You're just gonna make it worse. - Your friend is right. - He's not my fucking friend. Well, he's still right. You don't want this blade moving. Let me sedate you. No. I am not going to sleep like this. I won't wake up. All right. All right, then. Just try and be still. So you've seen stuff like this before, right? A patient with a 4-inch blade in her head? No. There is a knife in your brain. - Right, yeah. - By some miracle, you're still alive. If you're gonna get stabbed, you picked the right spot, but, then... -you would. - Doc. I'm gonna live through this, right? Tell me. If the blade stays in, the infection will kill you for sure. Taking it out could kill you also. But your odds are much better with that. People have survived this. - Help me with these restraints. - What? No, no. Fuck, no. Fuck. Doc, what the hell? - Just taking the edge off. - Oh, fuck you, junkie piece of shit. I could do this job as high as Hendrix. - But I cannot do it with the shakes. - Fucked up. - Oh, brilliant. - See? Fuck. Now, try and not move. - What the fuck are you gonna do? - Pull it out. - Jesus. - Pull it out? Fucking do it. Get it out. Okay, please. Please. - Fucking get it out. - Hold still. Damn. Look at that. How often does she take these? The antibiotics, twice a day. They're strong. - We don't want any infection. - Right. You know, cases like these, often, there's a full recovery. But sometimes, it's not so full. What does that mean? Well, loss of some motor function, memory loss, sometimes seizures. The other pills are for those. - Do these stop them? - Not exactly. The fact is, if she does start having seizures... I hope she's set aside some cash. I don't think her employers have a retirement plan, do they? Not the kind you mean. Listen. Let's just keep this between us for now. - Okay, Rankin? - Yes, of course, Mr. Prescott. And she'll be fine, probably. It is Eve, right? She's practically invulnerable. So this is Eve's place? Not very homey, is it? Have you met her? She doesn't like attachments. It's okay. You're safe. Okay? It's me. - Was that Russian? - Greek. She speaks a number of languages. You can take off now. I've got this. You're gonna take care of her and you have a key. Right. I don't wanna know. Damn it. - Graham. - I know. The Anderton job went to hell. I can explain. I'm not the one you have to tell it to. I'm sorry, man. You on some fucking vacation I don't know about? I was dealing with one of my ops. She was injured on the job. Okay, so that's the excuse? Because that was a very big mess, Prescott. I hope no one's expecting to get paid for those extra 3 packages. No, those are on the house. You're gonna fucking joke now? I'm sorry, it's been a long week. A fucking kid is dead. What happened? She skipped gymnastics. It couldn't have been predicted. Fucking 14 years old. Not like I give a shit, but some people do. You know, my dad, he may run this town... but we still got people watching us. In Chicago, New York. They're not very fond of bloodbaths. Things are about to change in a very official way, Prescott. So I wanted to impress upon you, personally... just how fucking bad you made me look on this. So this player of yours... is this something we need to take care of? Because I'll tell you, the way I'm feeling... I'm happy to fix her myself. No. No, it was a one- off thing. She'll be back to work anytime. Make sure she doesn't fuck up again, Prescott, or I'll drop you both. Get out. Oh, my God. Fuck you. Get back. Look straight at me. Good. Again. Good. What about headaches? - How bad, I mean? - Bad. If you've got anything stronger than aspirin, I would probably blow you. Doc. I'll give you something anyway. So am I brain- damaged or what? Well, you tell me. What does that mean? Have you had any seizures? Blackouts? Doc, I've been in bed for 3 days. I mean, give me some time. Her neuro tests were good. I'd still like her to take it easy over the next few weeks. Monitor her recovery. - She's not gonna like that. - I'm stunned. Come on, don't be an ass. What did he say? When can I get back to work? He said you're a miracle that science itself cannot measure. Yeah. - Said you'll probably outlive us all. - I could outlive you right now. Answer the question. He said you're recovering well, but you need to keep taking it slow. - So put me on light duty. - Not gonna happen. I can't sit around here anymore. I'm going stir- crazy. I'm not putting you back in the field. If I could, I would make you stay in bed for 2 weeks. Jesus. Are you taking care of me now? I can't risk you getting hurt. Oh, that's sweet. I'm gonna stay at home and bake cookies. Should we get married? - We can have children. - Cut it out. - I thought we knew each other. - We do. Then get me back to work. Shit, just light duties. Fucking Franklin can do the heavy stuff. Goddamn it, Eve. I already said. I disabled the camera before I grabbed him. - Look, I'm not an idiot. - I'm not saying you are. - I'm just double- checking your work. - I did it. Remember, I am in charge here. Mr. Prescott gave me specific orders about you today. Hey, I'm just here to help. - That's right. - I wouldn't wanna upset Mr. Prescott. - So long as you're really up for this. - Goddamn. You're not even suppose to be here. This is my job. - Oh, fuck. - Hey. What's wrong? Fucking nothing. Wait. What the fuck, Eve? - There's nothing wrong. - No, no. - I'm fine. - No, you don't seem fine. Prescott told me to call if there was any problems with you. It's my ass on the line, not yours. Hey, hey, hey. Wait. Please stop. Fuck. Fuck. - All right. Hey, Eve. - Goddamn it. Give me that. Hey, give it, give it. - Give it back, Eve. - Get away from me. Oh, Eve. Goddamn it. I'm not gonna say anything. Yeah, I wouldn't either. You know what I mean. To them. Look, Franklin. It's just the fucking meds, all right? Don't worry about it. Whatever you say. It's just the fucking meds. What did you do to me? What did I do? You said I was fine. You said there was no fucking damage. You fucking lied to me. No, no, I would never lie to you. Please, just settle down. Please. So, what is it you need, Eve? I wanna help you. Then tell me what happened. You said I would be fine, but there's something wrong, all right? Something in here. Okay. What exactly are you experiencing? Nightmares, all right? Nightmares. People, okay? Targets that I've taken out. I keep seeing them. Well, you have an extreme job, Eve. It's only natural that you- - No, all right? This isn't natural. Not for me. What the hell have you got me on? No, it can't be the drugs. That's not right. I need to run some tests. Let me schedule a CAT scan. We can- - No. Fuck your tests. I hope this isn't a social call, Mr. Prescott. Haven't made out under the bridge since high school. No, Agent Taylor. This is business. There's about to be a shake- up in the L.A. branch. Does the FBl know anything about that? That's what we're hearing from our sources back East. Cameron Downes is planning to take over from his father. Word is he's got some competition. Who? No one's talking. Interesting. So tit for tat, what do you know about the murder... of Mr. Davis Anderton the other night? Not a thing. Now, Anderton was giving up intel on one of your boys, Arthur Max. - That's not the deal, Danni. - Fuck you. Anderton's little girl was killed too. What do you want from me? I'm trying to stay alive here. What? What do you want? Fuck off. What do you what from me? It'll be taken care of. You're up tomorrow. Hey, Eve, it's me. I'm just calling to check in. I wanna be sure you're okay. And don't not call me back because I just said that. Thank fucking God. Eve. Fuck, Graham. I fucking had to. You gonna tell me why she hit you? I would if I knew. Shouldn't have put her back to work. She wasn't ready for anything. Seemed like she was having a bad acid flashback. Did she have a seizure? What, like a fit? No. - Is she supposed to? - Yeah, she could. That's another reason you have to find her fast... before this gets worse. Jesus. What kind of pills did the doc put her on? - I don't know. Antibiotics, painkillers. - That's it? Oh, this is totally fucked. Mr. Max can't find out about this. - Arthur Max is the least of our worries. - Shit. I'm more concerned about who she's gonna hit next. So, what's the problem with this whole takeover that I'm not seeing? I'm hearing that Lyman's coming down to handle the deal. - Lyman's respected a man. - He's a fat motherfucker. It is a fucking insult. The partner should be coming down, and you know that. They wanna see how you'll handle yourself. Play their game before they'll accept you. I'm the one who's gonna be running this family, Arthur. August Downes was my father. Believe me, I have fucking earned it. You're the favorite son here, Cameron. No question. But this is not a done deal. You've gotta be smart. You gotta keep your eyes open. I mean, we don't need your pretty sister trying to reach around on us. Do not talk about Regina like that, Arthur. I don't trust her either, but that is for me to say, not you. You're right, Cam. I'm sorry. I need this deal closed, Arthur. How do we handle this? You gotta look like you'll play ball. Set up the Lyman meeting at my place. I'll help smooth things out. We'll find out what New York's thinking. How are you doing, Mr. Max? How you doing? - Hey, boss. - Hey, boys. - Doughnuts, boss? - Not for you. They're for company. Lyman's coming in from New York. Lyman? Hey, clean this place up, will you? I'm not your mother. Looks fine to me. Where do you think you are? Mr. Max has been trying to quit. Motherfucker. I'm doing it. I'm doing what you want, okay? I'm doing it. Hey, boss. Okay if I smoke just outside? - No, it drifts back in. - Told you. Fucking idiot. Fuck you. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Jesus, girl. I never thought it'd be you they'd send. Who was it? Tell me that much. Shut up. Where's this coming from? Chicago? New York? Shut up. Is this what you want? Is this gonna do it for you? Lady, who the fuck are you talking to? - You wouldn't understand. - Wait. Stop. Stop. Eve? Eve. Where the hell are you now? Better call me back right now, Prescott. Right now. Yeah, that's right. Got you tied up with your own shit. How do you like that, huh? You know how bad you stepped in this? I work for August Downes. Couldn't give a fuck. I'm really gonna enjoy this, you know? That's the spirit. You know, the problem with being me, Eve... is I got too many options here. I could sell your ass over in Dubai. Fetch top dollar too. Or I got these guys in the valley. They will crucify you for me. Nail you to the fucking dungeon wall. And that's just for starters. Or I could just do you myself. Right here, one bullet. Now, personally, I'm leaning toward the boys in the valley. Because you got me smoking... and now my wife is gonna fucking kill me. But you tell me who sent you... .I might could go for what's behind Door Number 3 instead. Marie. Her name is Marie. Who the fuck is Marie? Motherfucker. Sending your bitch hitter after me in my place? Arthur. What? - Eve is there? - Oh, yeah. Your girl came in all ninja and shit. You should've hired out- of- town for the job. It's not like you. Listen to me. I didn't send anyone after you. Eve isn't well. You got that right. You're not gonna be too well soon. Cameron and me, we're gonna fucking see you. As soon as I get done playing with- - Arthur? Arthur. Arthur. Hey, what's up, boss? What? Oh, come on. Come on. Stay in the car, Mr. Lyman. Fuck. Seriously? Kenji? Oh, shit. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. I work for Mr. Max. I'm one of his guys. Mr. Max is dead. They're all dead. Except for the guy outside. Oh, Jesus. - Do you know who? Did you get them? - No. Whoever did this, they're gone. - What are you doing? - Hold still. I got something very sharp here. I'm trying to cut you free. Looks like you had a bad one tonight. Who are you? I'm Vera. I'm your neighbor from across the hall. Now, you're still doing rough trade, I see. - What? - I know. I had to learn that lesson myself the hard way. Okay, now, come here. Okay. What are you doing in my house? I am keeping you out of jail, missy. Yeah. See, anybody else would have called the cops... ...finding you like this. Anyone but me. Now, I could have told you it would end up like this. Come here, you poor baby. Stop. Lady, just leave me alone. You know, someone's gotta help you out once in a while. Right? You just gotta let them. Because, honey, you ain't walking through this life alone. Just let Vera find you something to wear... that hasn't got blood all over it. Okay. Just wait. Oh, I used to be like you, you know? I'd do everything myself. But I got out and you can too. Of course, I do miss some things. I'll admit that. The pretty stuff. The clothes. Oh, especially the clothes. They say that envy's a sin... but I figure Jesus will just have to forgive me for that. It's something you learn in the program, you know, forgiveness. I learned forgiveness. Once you figure out you've hit rock bottom, then you're gonna need.... I didn't do nothing, boss. Yeah, you did nothing. You saw nothing. You're a useless piece of fucking shit. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Fuck it. How many did you see? No. Not me. I was in the car. My guy chased someone. At least one. They killed my guy. My best guy. I give a shit about your men right now? No. This other guy. Who was he? The one you let leave. I didn't let him leave. He just left. He said he worked for Arthur. I thought he was one of his soldiers. He looked youngish. Jesus Christ, you took him for his word on that? Nice work, Carey. When I decide to call the cops... they'll fix you up with a sketch artist. I apologize. I wasn't at my best. I just- - Arthur and I had this deal tonight. The Seattle thing,and, well, I ju- - I just mean, you know, it's time- sensitive. No disrespect, no disrespect. The thing is, you have to remember, this is- - Cameron, this is your deal. - You know what I mean? - Prescott. It's your money at stake. It's just business. You gotta shut the fuck up. This is crazy, Cameron. Boss, not to tell you your business, but you can't kill Carey Lyman. New York wouldn't like it. Listen to me, Cameron. Don't do anything foolish. Jesus Christ. Leave. Now while I'm still hearing reason. All right, Prescott, let's see what you got to say. I did it. Goddamn you. What else do you want from me? I work for August Downes. I work for August Downes. You clean? No entourage? I didn't have anyone on me. They're all too busy freaking out right now. With good reason too. Yeah, I'm staying away from my place until this thing settles down. You should do the same until I figure some safe way out of this. Is that some special safe way that doesn't include the obvious? Look, Eve has to be put down. Fast, and you know it. Don't be so pussy- whipped. You'll get us killed. Hey, remember who you're talking to. Shit. You don't even see what's going on. The other day with the lawyer guy? Eve couldn't even pull a trigger. And now she's taking down 5 guys, including a made man? I mean, doesn't it seem like maybe- - Maybe she's going after bad guys now? I mean, technically. No, Eve doesn't see the world that way: Good guys and bad guys. Yeah? Well, maybe she got stabbed in the fucking brain and now she does. And where does that put you and me? She needs help. Wake up, Prescott. If it was me doing this, I'd be dead already. And you know it. Franklin. Franklin. - For the Downe residence. - You know where to sign in. Boy, they got you on a regular schedule, doc. Yep. I thought it was. No, but it does look fantastic. I'm thinking of doing it myself. Yes, I saw him. Like anyone would ever wanna touch his shriveled little dick again. I know. I can't believe I ever slept with him. Well, at least I was first. I mean, in our group. Not like I devirginized him. Rich people, right? Like rest of us don't even exist. You know what, doc? Don't even get me started. Agent Taylor. Thank you for meeting me on such short notice. You're officially wasting my lunch break. What is it? I need a favor. You've turned our arrangement into a real one- way street. You want something from me, I need something too. Let's say I give you some of the Wu- Yang bosses. Don't fuck with me, Prescott. Our agents have been on the Chinatown gangs for months. I want intel on your organization. You know I can't do that. I would be dead within a week. That's your problem. Danielle, please. Give me something useful. Something big. Otherwise, forget it. Okay. Let's say I make this a real 2-way street... and I give you what you want. Let's say you do. What kind of deal are you looking for? I want immunity. Clean passports and a way out of here no one can track. Passports. Plural. Got a woman involved in this, Prescott? Can you get them? Oh, well. Mr. Pretty Boy. What have you gotten yourself into? If you wanna live through the next weeks, you're gonna listen... and you're gonna do exactly what I say. You don't get it, Eve. If I take you up there, they will kill me if you don't. Do you know who this patient is? Yeah. A dead man. Eve, listen to me. It's not too late to turn around. I won't say a word. You don't even realize. You don't have to do this. I wouldn't be here if I didn't have to be. Where is it? Penthouse. Security, how many? Not many. It's a man at the door, a few inside. - That's it? - If you would listen to me.... Eve, what's happening to you? It's nothing. Eve, look. You need help. You need treatment. Let- - No more of your medicine, doc. - I'm helping myself. - Eve.... - What's up, doc? - Hello, Chip. Just here to see Mr. Downes. The usual. Who's this? Oh, my new nurse. Greta. Hello. Do me a favor. Tell Miss Downes I need a bathroom break, okay? Sure. Everything okay, doc? Yeah. He's gonna know. He's gonna know I was with you. Chip, he just peed his pants while his boss got done. - He won't say a word. - Oh, jeez. Get the door. Hold on. Hello? I got it. Hey, doc, that time again? Sure, yeah. Who's she? Oh, that's my new nurse. She held me hostage. How many more? - Doc, how many more? - I don't know. Fuck. Make sure this one's okay. I didn't mean to hit him that hard. What? Okay, sure. You stay here. And don't do anything stupid. Okay. Stay back. Just stay back. What, you're here for him? He's a helpless old man. Look at him. - He's nothing. He's- - - He's a monster. He's already dying. What difference can it make? It can't go on. - Dr. Rankin? - She made me bring her. - Held me at gunpoint. She's insane. - Stop. Just be quiet. Look, my father hasn't been running the business for years. It's been my brother using his name. Whatever was done to you, it was Cameron. Whatever you're looking for here, please take it from my brother. Please? Please. Let the old bastard die on his own time. So you're just gonna let us go? I didn't come for either of you. Thank you. Thank you. Just don't touch the doctor. - He doesn't get punished for this. - Of course. Dr. Rankin is our family doctor. Thank you, Miss Downes. I won't say anything to my brother. I promise. No harm has been done here. You can say what you want. I thought Cam had sent her to kill me. She really did have me at gunpoint, I- - I'm not making that up. Relax. Now, tell me again, what's going on with her? She made it seem like she's been seeing things almost. Like she can't sleep with all the murder she's done... all of a sudden. I'm not sure it's anything to do with her head injury. Not really. Oh, either way. If she takes care of Cam now, it'll all be done. How can you think she would do that? She couldn't even kill your father. What are you talking about? She blew Daddy's brains across his pillow. Right after she murdered you. Be careful with that thing, I- - I'm way too tired to dodge bullets right now. Maybe it would solve some of your problems. Jesus, Eve. What have you done to yourself? Just tried to make it stop, Graham. I just needed some fucking sleep. What are you talking about? Ever since that last job, I've been seeing her. Who? That girl, Marie, in the elevator. I'm not fucking crazy, Graham. - She keeps telling me- - - Eve, stop. You're not being haunted. It's just the injury, okay? You don't understand. You made a move on the Downes family. They're gonna kill you. I can get us out of this, Eve. A clean slate. New identities, new country. But I have to have the book to make it happen. Hey, we have to get the hell out of here. I'll get the book tomorrow. Thank you. You're gonna need a clean passport. You got one of those? Yeah, a few. Good. I didn't hit you too hard, did I? I've been hit harder. This morning, when I heard what she did to your father... I had to reach out. I should've come forward. I should've warned you all that Eve had lost it. Yes, you should have. But I do recall Arthur speaking very highly of you. Let's just call it a lesson learned. I can take her down for you. I mean, I know Eve. And I know that she's losing control. Easy. You just slow down. There's been enough trouble over the last few weeks. Well, almost enough. Goddamn it, Regina. Graham. Hurt him some more, Tommy. But not too hard. I need him awake for this. Tell us where she is, Prescott. Give us an address, and this can all be over. Come on. All those years... you thought you were so much better than me. Graham, I need you to answer the phone. Graham, please answer the phone. Graham. Graham. Graham. Graham. Look at me. Look at me. I'm so sorry. Stop it, all right? Stop it. - I didn't mean.... - Don't, don't. Don't. No. Graham, I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm right here. Don't go home. What? Graham. Graham. Girlie. Eve? It's your neighbor. Hello? I brought you some pamphlets from the program. Hope you don't mind that I took your spare key. It seemed wise in the state you were in. Who's that girl? Vera. Who do you want? Vera. You want me? You want this? You can't handle this. Vera. So Arthur... takes this fucking guy. And he just: Crushes his skull into the curb. Fucking 12th grade. Not even a man yet. I hear you, boss. You know, this should be his night, not my dad's. Fucking protocol. Of course I'll be there. Yeah. You should've seen Cam. He actually thinks it's his idea to have it there. I know. Wait until the board sees this travesty. Oh, I know, I know. Well, now he's saying he took care of Prescott too. So, what is this that we're doing, exactly? Well, it's called fucking most of the time. You know what I mean. We both know this world. Let's not make this more than it is. Are you saying that for me or for you? I'm sorry, Vera. I'm not you. I'll be right back. You actually had him brought here? I thought you were joking on that part. I mean, you don't you think it's a bit overboard, Cam? No. No, Dad loved this place. Besides, he'd want a real old- style wake. Like a man. You're not worried that the partners might find it a bit strange? A little disrespectful? What fucking business are we supposed to be in, Regina? It's not like I'm gonna open the casket and have girls... lap dance the man into the afterlife. Jesus, Cameron, he doesn't even have a face. I'm kidding. Don't get your panties in a twist. Who's the new guy? Oh, him? Well, he used to work for Arthur, and now he works for me. Wait, this is the guy who bailed after Arthur got hit? - Prescott's kid? - Let it go. Let it go, little brother. The kid is mine. Oh, don't you start fucking the help, Gina. Why should you be the only one to have any fun around here? Where's the fucking bathroom in this ass ranch? Back into the left. Thank you. Sorry, doll, this is a private party. And I'm, like, "The dildo show?" And he's like, "That what it's called, isn't it?" I'm like, "No, sweetheart... it's called pegging when you do it to the guy." You're all about to get really fucking quiet. And for your own good, you're gonna walk out that back door. You're gonna keep walking until you get home. You're in the wrong bathroom, honey. Shit. So do you, like, know kung fu? You look strong, you know. I wanna learn that shit, looks good- - Yeah. Where the fuck are the girls? I think they went to go powder their nose. I'll double- check. I'll be back, I forgot my cigarettes. - Oh, no, I can get them, ma'am. - No, it's fine. I'll be back in a minute. - Can I have my keys? - Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Yes, police? I need help. You need to send me help right now. I saw guns, they have guns. I think they're gonna kill somebody. What the hell is she doing? - What's going on? - Well, she just took the car. Shit. I thought you said you fucking killed this bitch. - I thought we did. - Fucking idiot. Fuck. Franklin? - What are you doing here? - What did you expect? You'd just kill them all and leave me and Prescott to clean up your mess? See how well that worked out for him. Franklin, stop. You're not a part of this. Just get out of here. You want me to run? What? So they can send somebody after me? Somebody like you? Somebody like me? Franklin, you're not like me. Don't do it. Damn it, Franklin. You can walk away from this world. It's too fucking late, Eve. They're not gonna let me walk away. That went off the table when you started killing all the wrong people. They're not the wrong people, Franklin. And you're not one of them. I am now. Franklin. You're not getting there. Stop thinking you are. You're hurting. I'm guessing I'm faster. It doesn't have to be like this, Franklin. Eve, what did you expect? You need to get that? I'll get it. What? You got someplace to be? Fuck that. You know what the best part is? You came in here, a cold- blooded killer... so no matter what I do, it's self- defense. You made me wanna kill you. You're gonna die today. Franklin. A whole lot of bodies you left at that strip joint, Eve. I don't remember anything. Not gonna fly. I've seen your files. All of them. Your friend already told us about you, anyway. - Franklin? - Franklin? No, I'm talking about Graham Prescott. Franklin's dead. Yes, he and Mr. Prescott have that in common. Graham was talking to you. He and I were working on a deal. I'm gonna make a different deal with you. - Miss.... - Agent Taylor. Agent Taylor. What the hell could you have to offer me? Freedom, maybe. You're going away for a long time, Eve. But you do good work. I admire that. So maybe some of that work should be for us. It's not as if you killed anyone that matters- - No. I'm done. You can put me wherever you want. But I'm done. Give it time. You'd be surprised how a prison cell inspires cooperation. Do you really think Prescott would want that? He was about to throw his whole life over for you. Okay, listen. You just need a few big fish, right? Big fish make big careers. I have a book... detailing over 10 years worth of mob hits. Who ordered them, how much they got paid. How much would that be worth to you, Agent Taylor? Look at you. You're like a pig in shit with that book. I can't believe you got your hands on it. This book is gonna pave the way up the ladder. Yeah, well, call me and remind me when you're SlC that I trained you- - Oh, stop, Keller. Here, tell me if you see anything on the daughter in there. - Regina? - Yeah. I have to be honest. I don't think we're gonna find her here. I mean, look at her. Just doesn't look like the criminal type. She's not gonna keep the family going. She's probably looking for some good, clean charity to get behind. Find a statesman, get married... have a couple of kids, clean up the family name. I bet the Downes crime family is dead. Regina 's the last one standing. I bet she is dirtier than all of them. Well, there's nothing in here that I see. The book says she's clean. I don't believe that. What the hell?
