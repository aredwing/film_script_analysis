Petramco now owns this piece of real estate. And.... Well, you're gonna have to clear out. Shit. We're gonna have to show them a little muscle. Stop! English. I'm impressed. I'm very impressed. Father sent me to missionaries to learn about the white man. Great. Honey, you get your people on these trucks. - I have a forest to clear. - This is our home. You got five minutes to get on those trucks. If you stay, you burn with the trees. Now get them on the trucks. Where the hell are they going? Deep into the forest to the river. Well, sooner or later the flames will find them. You know, it's a shame to clear this jungle. It's so pretty. But business is business. Let's go. You must let me go, Father. I'm the only one who knows their ways. - Can I help you, sir? - He does not speak your language. Oh, do you have an appointment with someone? Please, can you tell me where I can find the chairman? You mean Mr. Gaines. Well, he's either in his office here or in Tokyo or New York or London. - But I don't see your- - - And how do I get to his office? Up the stairs. Thank you. Just hold it. Where do you think you're going? - To see the chairman. - You do have an appointment? No, but my father sent me. Nobody sees the chairman without an appointment. I must see the chairman. Sorry, sweetheart, not without an appointment. Hey, hold on, Bigfoot. - What's in the pack? - Gifts for the chairman. Oh, God. Control, three here. Stand by. There's a small situation developing in the lobby. - What's your name? - Nisa. - Nisa what? - What? - What is your last name? - I am Nisa. - That is all. - Okay. Hey, Bob. Can you check the register for a visitor named Nisa? - Nisa? - Yeah. Just Nisa. - No, none here. - No one by that name, huh? - No. None all day long. I'm sorry. - Sorry, folks. I have to escort you out of the building. And I'll help you pick up your shells and your toys. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's going on down there? Relax. Gene? Gene, you all right? Take it easy now. Be cool. Hey, hey, hey. Back off. Be cool. Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy. Hey, hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Well, well, well. The little girl from the jungle. - You! - Now hold on, sweetheart. You're trying to go places you're not wanted. Get up. Up, up. Come on. You okay? You all right? What the hell is going on here, Cutter? Officer, hold on to her. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you? I thought you were sick. No, I'm all right. I'm Carmen. I walk by this fountain every morning. But never before do I see you. - What is your name? - I'm Nisa. Do you have papers? I had papers. The police have them now. There's only one thing that can straighten out this mess. - Money. - I have no money. Child, you need help. - I know. I get you a job. - There is work for me? Yes, I think I could get you a job. Besides, you are young and pretty. - They will love you. - I'm happy to work. What kind of work is it? Now you've seen the upstairs bathrooms. We have five down. One is yours. You can do with that as you like. I want the others cleaned from floor to ceiling... ...including the toilets, at least twice a week. Are you getting all of this? Oh, I hope so... ...because the last Mexican girl we had was thick as a brick. - I am from Brazil. - Oh, we were there just last winter. We stayed at the Plaza del Sol in Rio. Beautiful place. Do you know it? Oh, of course not. Anyway, these are the downstairs bedrooms. They are for guests. Except this one... ...which our good- for- nothing son occupies occasionally. It's 3:00, Jason. In case getting up ever occurred to you. Out dancing all night. Whenever he's like this, you can skip his room. - How will I know? - If you don't see him eating... ...it's probably safe to assume he's passed out in there. Now this is the entertainment.... Oh, God, you startled me. Oh, hello. - Oh, I hired a new maid today. - That's good. - I hope she's better than the last one. - She seems okay. Oh, she's an absolute darling girl. And she does an outstanding job. But- - Well, I am a bit concerned about having her live here. I don't want a thief, if that's what you mean. She might pocket change we leave out, but I'll watch her for that. But what worries me is that she seems so, I don't know... ...different from the other girls we've had. You know, she only had one small handbag with her. Oh, I'm afraid she only has one change of clothes. I don't care what she wears as long as she does a good job. I just hope she takes a bath every now and then. Jason, where do you think you're going? - Out. - Could you be a little more specific? Dancing. Yo, you're in luck, it's Jason. Oh, hi, Ash. I'm on my way. We had a date. I want to dance with you. Tonight. Look, are you gonna dance with me or not? Okay, fine, fine. Fine. Damn. Why not? Come on. You look great. Mom would die if she saw you in her dress. I do not wish to make your mother upset, Jason. My mom likes being upset. She's made it a lifestyle. I want you to meet some of my friends. - Hey, guys. - Well, look who finally showed up. Where's Ashley? I don't know. She copped a major attitude. - I don't know where she is. - What's new? Aren't you dancing with Ashley at the Kid Creole audition? I'm dancing. I don't know what she's doing. - So who's your friend? - Guys, this is Nisa. Nisa, this is Dave and Trish. She works for my dad. - I'm a- - - Legal secretary. She takes the bar this April. This is my song. - You want to dance? - If you like, but- - - Later, guys. - See you. So when did Jason start dating wetbacks? Hell if I know. Ask Ashley. Come on. Don't you like this song? - I never heard it before. - It's on the radio all the time. Not where I come from. - Yeah, where's that, Mars? - Brazil. I thought the whole world would've heard this. - It's a big world. - Not where I come from. - What is this, Johnny? - Let's sit down. - I like this. - You like this music? - Very much. What is it called? - I think it's called Lambada. It's supposed to be the rage in Europe. - Dance it with me. - Oh, no. It's not really my type of music. It's more East L.A. than Beverly Hills. Dance with me. Move from here down. Become a tree with deep roots flowing with life. Good. And everything else will follow. Hey! Check out Ricky Ricardo. Would you look at that. - God, he is so good. - It's not him. It's her. She is hot. - Hey, let's dance. Let's do it. - All right. Why did you call me a legal secretary? I'm sorry if that hurt your feelings. It seemed simpler to tell them what they wanted to hear. - I'm not a legal secretary. - I know. - I'm not a maid. - I know. You're something special... - ...something different. - But you do not know me. No, but I want to know you. This world seems so far away from the world of my problems. Leave your problems at home. That's what I always say. - I mean, that's where mine are. - My problem is the reason I'm here. What do you mean? - Can I trust you, Jason? - Sure. I'm Mr. Trustworthy. - Tell me, Nisa. Maybe I can help. - Jason! Hey! Jason! - You said you weren't coming. - So? I changed my mind. When did they start letting your kind into this club? - She's with me. - No, I'm with you and you're with me. - Who are you? - I am his girlfriend. Is that true, Jason? - Maybe I should go. - Yes, go. I'll go with her. Jason! You get back here, Jason Anderson! Oh, nice move! I'm sorry, Nisa. Jason, come on. It's just a stupid dress. Shut up! Way to go, Anderson. Grow up. Then maybe we can talk. I don't know why you got me up at 2 a.m. He's come in late before. - Couldn't we talk about this tomorrow? - No, Bradley, enough is enough. It's time we had a serious talk. I'm not gonna put up with him out dancing night after night- - All right, all right, I hear you. Here we are, home sweet home. Where were we? Oh, yeah. That dance you taught me. - The Lambada. - Yeah. Why is it called... - ...the forbidden dance? - Fifty years ago... ...the government of Brazil forbid it because it was too sexy. - Get out of town. - Really. - Yeah? - Really. - It has been fun, but the dress. - Don't worry about the dress, all right? It's my mom's dress and she's my mom. All right? I'll handle it. No sweat. - I just can't take- - - Okay. Jesus. - Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. - Good evening. - Well, good night. - Jason! We want to talk to you. Alone. Sure, Dad. I won't be long. What's up? What were you doing with that girl? - We went dancing. - Dancing? In my dress? - You let her steal my dress? - Mom, I stole it. Jason, that dress was just cleaned yesterday. - Well, it's still clean, but it- - - Clean? For God's sakes! Her perspiration will have soaked right into the dress. - That's gonna smell nice. - I don't even want to think about it. Jason, you gotta understand something. This isn't about a dress or even about the girl. It's about- - - Nobody saw us, all right? - Jason, it isn't proper to date the help. You just don't do that. They're different from us. You can see that. Your father and I don't feel it's fair to us... ...that you spend your time running in and out of dance clubs. Mother, I dance. I like it, and I'm good at it. That's wonderful, Jason. But we want you to think about your life! Okay. All right, I'll think about it. You'd better do something about it... ...or you're going to find yourself out on the street without a cent. - Am I making myself clear? - Yeah. We don't want you fraternizing with the hired help. We went dancing. We didn't go to bed. Well, I should hope not. There's enough of those people in the world without you fathering more. Will you keep it down? She might hear you. I want her to hear me! And I want her out of my dress. - About the dress- - - What about it? I hope you realize it's a Christian Dior original... ...and it cost me more than that maid makes in a year. - So get her out of it. - Okay. Okay, fine, all right. I'll get the damn maid out of your dress. Nisa. - Have mercy. Hello, hello. - Hello. Hello. Come on down. - What can we do for you? - I can dance for money? You can dance. Hey, that's great. Mickey! - She wants to dance. - Welcome to the Xtasy, love. - I'm Mickey. I run the show. - Hello, Mickey. If you'd like to dance for money, you should dance for me. I run a class operation. You would like to dance, wouldn't you? On stage? Like them? No. No. You'd be on the dance floor, dancing like I was when you came in. - And I can make money? - Listen, angel. You can make more money than you can count. And don't worry. I'm gonna help you take care of it. I am gonna take good care of you. - So when can you start? - I can start tonight. - Tonight? - Is that okay? Yeah, it's okay. It's spectacular. How about 1 0 bucks a night? - Bucks? - Yeah, bucks. You know, dollars. - You're not from L.A., are you? - No, I'm from Brazil. Oh, God. Well, at least you can dance. All Brazilians can. We gotta get you out of those clothes. Where'd you get those, Goodwill? I've got some great things down here. Charlene, go see Eddie. He's got your check for your doctor bill. You, my friend, don't have the coin. This one's special. She's fresh. Know what I mean? Freddie, come on. Be a good little boy. Don't even think about it. Now I told you, this one's special. And you, my friend, don't want to pay. One way or the other. You see, Mickey's gonna take good care of you. By the way, do you have a green card? I didn't think so. - So, what's your name? - Nisa. Nisa. I like that. It's very sexy. And this is the perfect dress for a girl named Nisa. Go ahead. Try it on. Come on, little girl, you're gonna look so pretty in that red. That's it, now just relax. All the men are just gonna love you. Sweet little face. Now I want you to just do it, okay? That's a girl. Come on, honey, don't be shy. You're gonna look so pretty in that red dress. That sweet, little young body. The gentlemen downstairs are gonna go wild for you. That's a girl. Oh, honey, you are beautiful. Come on. Want me to help you undress a little bit? I'll report back this afternoon on that matter, sir. - Just a minute, Maxwell. - Yes, sir. He's standing right here, but go ahead. Thanks. So there was a security incident with two Brazilian nationals? - Who told you that? - Well, that's not your concern. I told you I wanted no trouble. It's your job to make sure there is no trouble. Clear? You pay me to take care of trouble. I'll take care of it. - Earn your money. - Yes, sir. We have danced with every cheap slut in this stinking town. - Now I need to get laid. - That's my boy! - Look. - The Xtasy! "Lambada. Dance with the queen of the jungle." - Hey, that's Jason's beaner. - Well, she's no legal secretary. - She's not a maid. - She's the queen of the jungle. Oh, my God, yes! - Hey, hey, hey! - Hey, hey, brother, what do you want? I ain't your brother. What I want is money. Ten dollars each. - You got it? - Yeah. No problem. Okay, you can pass. - Yeah, that's her, all right. - God, she looks good. Let's go. Hey! Hey, buddy, take a hike. Hey, baby, remember me? I'm Jason's friend. No! No, I don't want to dance with you. Get back here. - Come back here. - Leave me alone. Come on, queen of the jungle, show me the Lambada. - Stop it! - Show me how it's done. Come on, Jason doesn't know anything. - Leave me alone! - You do it with everyone else. Stop it! Leave me alone. Help me. Help me, please. Nisa. Nisa. Enough! No, not enough. Dave, that's enough, man. Mickey, you want me to handle this? No, I'll handle this one. You seem to be having trouble. Let me tell you about a rule we have here. Never before a girl is ready. Are you ready, honey? - Never. - You see? Go ahead, sweetheart, get cleaned up. Now, I know how to make you feel better. Girls. Now I want you boys to have a real good time tonight. And you come back another time and I promise you... ...Nisa will be good and ready. Tear it up, tiger. You sure you have his passport? I don't want trouble at the airport with Immigration. I got them right here. - What the hell was that? - Cuff him to the van. I'll check it out. Keating. What the hell is making that sound? Morgan. What the hell?! Where's the witch doctor? Jason. - Mind if I sit down? - Sit anywhere you like. Look, I need to apologize for the other night, okay? I guess I acted like a real bitch. It's just that seeing you with that girl made me jealous. What do you want, Ashley? For one thing, we need to talk about our audition for the Kid Creole Show. - You've gotta be kidding. - If we dance like we planned... ...then we really have a shot at winning this contest. I mean, think about it, a spot on national television. Isn't that intense? Jason, millions of people would be watching us. I don't think I'm gonna be dancing, Ashley. - Was there anything else? - Jason, what is going on? I mean, we had so many good plans together, right? I mean, the other night is over, okay? Hell, let's just forget it. Let's just go on with our lives, huh? I wanna make up. Jason, I have said that I am sorry to you. Now, what more do you want from me? Honey, I miss you. I miss you too. I just don't think it can be the same anymore. Why, Jason? Just because you had a little fling with a street girI? Forget it. I can forgive you for that. Don't call her that. She's not a street girl. Yeah? That's not what I've heard. - What are you talking about? - Nothing. - What are you talking about? - Stop it! If you know anything about Nisa, tell me. - Stop it, you're hurting me. - Spill it. All right, Jason, you know what? That little tramp is a professional. You know what I mean? If you've got the bucks, she's for sale. - Who told you that? - Your friends. Or maybe I should say your ex- friends. They found your Chiquita Banana girl working full- time in a sleazy sex club. - That's bullshit. - Yeah? You don't believe me? Why don't you just go ask Dave or Kurt or Weed? - They each had a turn with her. - Where is this place? I don't know. I don't hang out in that part of town. Damn it, Jason! Jason, so help me, if you go after her I'll- - You are really gonna regret this one. You're really gonna regret this one. - Forty- three hundred even. - Not bad. Yeah, it's a good night. Hey. Hey, can't you read? You see this sign? Go to school, boy. We're closed. - I want Nisa. - Yeah? So does everybody else. Come back tonight. Right now we're closed. Too bad. I hear from my friends she's really special. Yeah? I know your friends? - Do you know me? - I don't know, but I like your face. Go head onto the dance floor. I'll send her down. Hey, be nice. Nisa, someone's here for you. Dance with me. - Did you pay? - Please, just dance with me. It's all right. Everything's going to be all right. Okay? I'll help you. Why do you help now? Did not help before. I didn't know any better. I didn't know myself. I didn't know you. Let me take you out of here. You do not understand. Immigration will send me home... ...and I cannot go back until I'm finished here in this country. Who told you that? Mickey. She said if I did not stay, she would send me home. Who's Mickey? That woman? She lied to you. You don't have to stay in this place. Immigration won't send you back. I'll help you. And I have money if you need money. You don't have to sell yourself. It is you who doesn't have to sell yourself. They already own you. Your parents own you. Ashley owns you. Your friends own you. Is that not why you're here? Did they not tell you what I would do for you? So you see, we're not so different. You do what you must. I do what I must. And you will be my first upstairs. - No, Nisa. Please, don't do this. - Why not? It's only money. I said, no. I'm not gonna do this, and neither are you. I'm taking you out of here. - We don't offer takeout. - I am leaving. Not to come back. You're not going anywhere. We're making too much money off you. If you leave, I'll call Immigration, and I will have you deported. You go right ahead. You call Immigration. And while you're at it, you put in a call to the vice squad too. Eddie. - I told you to be nice. - Just relax, big fella. All right? I'm relaxed. I mean, can we talk about this? - We can talk. - Hey. - We can talk. - No! - Get off of him! - Yeah, we talking good now, boy. We talking good enough for you, boy? Nisa. - Make him stop. Stop him. - I can't. He's having too much fun. We talking good enough yet, punk? I don't think so. I'll do anything, just make him stop. Still talking good enough, huh? - No! - Yeah. What in the hell are you? I'll be back, punk. My mama had a mojo bag, but you ain't my mama, boy. Oh, no. You get away from me, you freak. No, he's my friend. Oh, that's good. Thanks. - Who is that guy? - He's Joa, our tribal shaman. What your people sometimes call a witch doctor. Get out of town. A witch doctor in L.A.? Hey, that's better. Thanks. I don't think he likes me. He wanted to leave you here. He thinks you're not fit for me. You should meet my friends. What do you think? I think it's not up to him. Help me up. Who are you? I know your name is Nisa, but who and what are you? Sit down here. I'm an Indian, Jason, from the rain forest of the Amazon. My father is the king of our tribe. - Then you're a princess? - Among my people I am. My father sent us as ambassadors to the chairman of Petramco. They must stop killing the trees, or the sun will eat the air. - You do not believe me. - No, no. I do believe you. You're talking about the hole in the ozone layer. This hole is getting bigger because of the burning of the rain forest. The sun will eat the air. This is bigger than you know. This is not only important to you. This is important to people everywhere. And it's important to me. Petramco must be stopped, Jason. The rain forest is our ancestral home. We will not permit them to destroy it! Just hold on, all right? If you're taking on Petramco, you've got a war on your hands. If war is what it takes, then war it will be. Jason. I can't believe you're buying this. Princess? Jason, she will say anything she can to get you away from me. Honey, she's a maid. Ashley, you are so beautiful. And so common. And such a bigot. - Jason- - - Excuse me. Jason, she's lying to you. Jason, this is absolutely crazy. Jason, why are you doing this? I need you. Okay, princess, you want a war? You got one. If the destruction of the rain forest continues at this rate... ...pretty soon this planet won't be fit to live on. - You're being overly dramatic, son. - No, I'm not. It's the truth. And Petramco had Benjamin Maxwell run these people out of their land. If Petramco owns the property... ...I don't see why they can't do what they want with it. They sure as hell didn't buy it from Nisa's people. Just because some paper says they own it... ...does it give them the right to round people up like cattle? That's wrong no matter how much money you have. That's why we need your help. Are you suggesting that I set up a court hearing... ...because a servant of mine wants to shut down... ...one of the world's largest multinational corporations? - I'm not a servant. - Her father's an Amazon king. I don't care if her father's the king of Siam. I do not want my son involved with an Indian princess from the jungle. You're both so close- minded! Stop going around with blinders on! - Don't talk to your mother like that. - Who is this man? What is he doing? If you must know, Mother, he's a witch doctor, and he saved my life. Jason, if you need to go to a doctor, go to a real doctor, not a witch doctor. Stop him. What's he going to do to me? What is he going to do? Bradley, do something. It is a gift. What you may call a peace offering. He does not understand your language. - He just knows that you are unhappy. - Jason, this has gone on long enough. - Then you're not gonna help us? - For God's sakes, do something. I want these barbarians out of my house. I want him and this girl to leave here this instant. Jason. I gotta tell you, if you leave with these people, that's it. You're on your own. No more money, no more credit. - You'll get nothing more from us. - Who's the barbarian, Mom? - Thank you for your help, Carmen. - Mi casa es su casa. - It's not much, but it's home. - Oh, it's very nice. Thanks. I'm glad for the company. When you telephone me, I put fresh sheets on the bed for you, Jason. And I think Nisa and I will sleep quite well out here. - I can't take your room. - Nonsense. The sofa is too small for you. Now, what are we gonna do about the doctor? Oh, yes. He's so quiet, I almost forgot about him. I guess he's the strong, silent type. I, for one, am certainly not going to try to move him. Well, then I think I'll hit the sack. I haven't slept much the last couple of days. - Good night. - Good night. Let me show you. Right through here, Jason. Straight down there. - Thanks, Carmen. Good night. - Good night, Jason. Get some rest. He is such a handsome young man, Nisa. You must tell me how you came to know him. Unless you prefer not to say in front of your guardian. He has sworn an oath of honor. Besides, he does not speak English. Carmen... ...would you think me rude if I left you to say another good night to Jason? I would think you foolish if you did not. Go ahead, your guardian will keep me company. Joa. For her sake, I hope she's gone until morning, eh, Joa? I see you do know music. They say that music is a universal language. And I know another. I knew you had it in you. Do you know of these things, Joa? Oh, that reminds me. One hundred and two hundred. My father's money will help whether he likes it or not. - It's too bad that's just the end of it. - Here, I can help. - No. - Don't give me that look. I want you to take it. I wanna help. That money is no good to me if I can't help my friends. - You're too generous, Carmen. - Thanks. You're a good friend. Hey, that's it. We got enough to buy Joa's plane ticket. Enough already. You have proved yourself to be loyal as a saint and stubborn as a burro. Listen to Nisa. One day she will be your queen. This is her decision to make, and you must do as you're told. That's more like it. I'll even go to the airport with you. - Thanks. Here's the money. - I have all the information here. - I'll take care of him. - You have a way with him. I think he likes you. Come along. You may know your way around the jungle... ...but I know L.A. and city buses. I'll make sure you make your plane. See you later. - Now, what did he say? - He misses the silence of the jungle. What's wrong? Joa will tell my father that I will stop Petramco. I still do not know if I will. We need leverage. I had an idea this morning how we can get some. Come on, Jason. We have to get on that show and naiI him. Then we have to win the audition. Come on, let's rehearse. - Benjamin Maxwell? - Ashley? Ashley Wells. Get in. Thank you for agreeing to meet me here. No, no. No problem at all. Well, what can I do for you? I understand you've done some consulting with my father Winston. Wells Electronics? Well, it looks like you've taken after your mother. Only on the outside. Inside, I am all Daddy. You must be one confused little girl. Well, hardly. Now, you're still the hired gun for Petramco, aren't you? - What do you want? - We have a mutual acquaintance. A certain Indian princess. - I know an Indian princess? - Save your act for the unwashed. I know she's as big a pain in the ass for Petramco as she is for me. So I thought it's about time we do something about her. - Where can I find her? - At this club, Creation. Jason and Nisa have been rehearsing here every afternoon. They're preparing a dance audition for the Kid Creole Show. And if they make the audition, they're on national TV. - I won't allow that to happen. - Well, I didn't think you would. We can't let them go on TV and preach anti- American propaganda. What are you gonna do to her? Let's just say I wouldn't do anything you wouldn't approve of. Jason, you like? What is that? No. Go change. And now the next auditioning couple for the Kid Creole Show: Ashley and Trevor. Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Jason. - Congratulations, you guys were great. - So how's the Peace Corps? - Give it a rest. - Anything for you, bwana. This is just a TV show to you. It's important to us. "Make the world safe for trees." Isn't that it, Jason? Your Highness. And now, here's Jason and Nisa. Great! Oh, great. Now with the winners, here's Mama Coconut, Adriana. Thank you. On behalf of Creation and Kid Creole and the Coconuts Show... ...I'd like to congratulate you and thank you, Jason and Nisa. Tomorrow night the Kid will be here live, in person... ...to beam them into every home in the United States. Jason, Nisa. You guys were great. - You were definitely the best. - What do you want? Oh, come on. Take it easy. We come in peace. I don't blame you for being pissed, but we wanted to say congratulations. - So congratulations. - You deserved to win. - You two were the best out there. - You guys were definitely the best. Also, I'm sorry about the other night. Yeah, I'm sorry too, Nisa. I acted like a real jerk and there's no excuse for it. But I am sorry, Nisa, if that means anything. Well, your pain was bigger than mine. - I knew you had it in you. - I wasn't so sure. - Come on, let's not get all teary- eyed. - What about you? Aren't you sorry? - Who, me? - Yeah. You were there too. That wasn't me, man. That was my evil twin. - How about a toast? - All right. - Jason? Nisa? - We'll pass. You guys aren't gonna drink with us? No. We gotta do this again tomorrow. Besides, I'm driving. Jason, take it with you. All right. - Later, guys. - You two take care. You take good care of that little princess, okay, dude? - What did I say? - Jason! Jason! There's a key under the mat. I'll be home late. Thank you for tonight, Jason. For you, my friend. Just kidding. Here. Thanks a lot. Well, how do you like my theater? Beautiful, isn't it? Do you know... ...that at one time it was considered to be... ...the most famous nightclub... ...worldwide? All the greats and near greats of entertainment... ...appeared here, one time or another, during the course of their career. Oh, well. Like all beauty, it fades. It's been closed now for over three years. But I've been thinking of reopening it. How would you like to star for me... ...right here on this stage? Lovely to hear your voice again, Your Highness. But do you think you could do that in English? Music. - I thought you liked this kind of music. - It is you I do not like. - What do you want? - You... - ...to audition. - I will never dance for you. Oh, yes, you will, princess. Or you may never see your tribe again. I got you a little gift here. Look familiar? Show me the Lambada. All right, Your Highness... ...let's see what you've got. The stage is all yours. Impress me. You call that rhythm? You'll never see Broadway, princess. You want to see the Lambada? I'll show you the Lambada. My shoes! No, no, no. This way. Wait, wait, let me help you. All right. I got the mandate to set a jailbreak I want the radicals to get a fair shake I got the mandate And now I feel great I wouldn't be surprised If people celebrate I got the mandate To set the job straight And when the deed's done I'm gonna legislate I got eyes in the back of my head And see I never took a second step I didn't need But I can take the static When a fanatic is looking for a piece Of the American dream It's automatic It's automatic While justice is vacationing I got to look out for the underling It's automatic Where the hell are this Jason and Nisa? Susan, listen up. The Lambada dancers are missing. No, I'm not kidding. Look, just get the Kid to fill. I don't know for how long. This is an emergency. Just get him to fill. - Are you Jason and Nisa? - Sorry we're late. What the hell happened to you two? - I just twisted my ankle a little. - Right. I'm sorry, man, but there's just no way you can dance on that. - Yes, I can. - We have to dance. - Not on this show. - I'm telling you, I can do it. - Please. - Look, I'm sorry, kid... ...but you need a doctor for that. I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. And now, music lovers, I give you... ...Miss Cory Daye, singing our new hit song, courtesy of Columbia Records: "It's a Horror." It's a horror You know my sole intention Was to be with you You know my sole intention Was to follow through I'm sure I needn't mention That my full attention Was forever centered on you You know it's my contention That you're missing screws Father. Joa, his ankle. Excuse me. I'm running this show, and the audience stays out front. - Now, who the hell is this guy? - He's Jason's chiropractor. Right. And I'm the Virgin Mary. Now, what is going on here? Don't worry. He knows what he's doing. Right? You know it's my contention That you're missing screws You treat a fine invention With an attitude You know it's my contention That your hypertension Is a mere extension of you It was my sole intention It was my sole intention It was my sole intention To be the center of you It was my sole intention Thank you, Cory. Cory Daye. I know we promised we were gonna see a Lambada... ...but our dance couple isn't gonna be able to make it, I'm afraid. That's right. That's right. Blame it on the Kid. Your injury is serious. To restore your ankle even for a little time requires dangerous medicine. How dangerous? Don't worry, you're young and healthy. In the jungle Joa could do more... - ...but here- - - Nisa, how dangerous? Holy shit! Oh, my God! All right, all right. I have good news for you. While we were away for that commercial break... ...I got word that the dancers are okay. Give it up! Give it up! So we will have Lambada. So let's give a big hand to Nisa and Jason doing the forbidden dance: Lambada! Now he's gone away Only man who's ever made me cry Not so far away But far enough to make me wanna die Crying over me is what he's gonna be When he's hit by the need of my love Crying he will be When he's dreaming of me And decides that he needs What once was All the memories Follow me wherever I may go Haunting melodies Playing in the night to let me know Dance along with me With the sun and the sea Only love makes one feel So sublime Do a dance with me To a love fantasy That for one precious moment Was mine Dance along with me Mr. Sun, Mr. Sea Keep the feeling so strong And so tender Do a dance with me To a love fantasy Just for one day of total surrender All right. Where in the world did you learn those moves, my man? - Nisa taught me everything I know. - Nisa. - That's an unusual name. - You like? - I love it. - It means "princess of the forest." My father, he's the king of our tribe. He chose it for me. - Hold it. Your father is a king? - Yes, would you like to meet him? I never say no to meeting a king. Sure. Is this a happening show or what? Now we got a king. "Kid meets King." I like that. It's an honor, Your Majesty. That's the idea. I could've used two of you kings last night on a poker game. I'm sorry, Mr. Kid Creole, but we must return to our home in the jungle... - ...while it still exists. - You live in the jungle? In the rain forest along the Amazon. But our home is being destroyed. That is why we have come to your country. We need help to stop the destruction. Nisa and her people are being driven from their homeland... ...by the Petramco Corporation. The Petramco we find on the supermarket shelves? That's the one. We buy products they make every day. Not me. Not anymore. The rain forest is too important. I say, if Petramco is destroying the rain forest, then... ...we should just boycott their ass.
