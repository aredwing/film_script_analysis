Go! Go! Move! Move! - Head around the corner. - Keep going! Push through! Push through! Push forward to the wall! Push forward to the wall! I've got four guys with AKs, RPGs in the tree line. Press that guy! Hey! Trying to get your ass shot off? Get in there and stay down! Guys, let's go! Going in! You're staring at me. Can't help it. Oh, it's freezing out here. What are you doing? I told Blake I'd get the champagne. Oh, no. Let her get it. Come back to bed. It's 3:00 in the afternoon. And in an hour from now, it'll be 4:00 in the afternoon. I know. I told her I'd do it, though. Alright. Let me get my coat and we're going. No, no, no, no. I got it. I'd rather do it myself. OK. OK, sure. When are you gonna let me turn this into an engagement ring? You do not EVER give up. No. Not when I want something. I thought we agreed on this. Whatever happens, happens. On, God. - It's already happened. - Oh... Stop. You sure you don't want me to come? No, I'm good. Hold down the fort. Will do. Hey. Hey. Oh. Hello, Sara. Hi, Antonio. Any big plans for tonight? Yep. I'm gonna work late. New Year's Eve's for amateurs. Can I grab you a cab? No, no, I'm good. I'm just going to the store. - Be safe, young lady. - Thank you. - Hey! Look out! - Ah! What, are you blind? Yeah. - I am. - Hey. You OK? I saw the whole thing. What an asshole. Nothing new. This city's full of 'em. - Here, let me help you... - No. No. I got it. Thank you. It's actually better if I do it myself. My lightsabre. Oops. Sometimes I get cocky and I forget that I need it. Hey, I can walk you where you're going. No, I know where I'm going. Thanks, though. - Are you sure? It's no trouble. - Yeah. Happy New Year. Yeah. Yeah, you too. You, uh... you got the light. OK. Thank you. You watch out for assholes. I will. Call from Blake. - Hey, Blake. - Hey. - Where are you? - Out. Buying champagne. Great. Are you on your own? Yes. I'm on my own, all by my lonesome. Good. I'm glad you're getting out. You spend way too much time hiding out in that penthouse with Ryan. My God, what's wrong with hiding out? Don't make me feel guilty for finding a guy I like. Stop busting my chops. - I'm your sister. It's my job. - Yeah. You and Danny gonna come over and ring in the New Year with us? Danny had to pull a double and he's not even home yet, so he'll have to sleep for a couple of hours. - Please try and make it. - We will. Just gonna be a little last-minute, OK? I love you. Alright, love you too. Sara. How'd it go out there today? I didn't walk into any telephone poles. That's good. Have yourself a good evening. Thank you. You too. Ryan? It's the lady with the liquor. You here? Ryan! Ryan? Ryan? Ryan? Good girl. Good girl. You can't be hungry, Shadow. I just fed you. Oh, my God. Ryan. Ryan? Oh, my God. Ryan? Oh, my God. On... Ryan. Baby. Ryan. Help! Ryan! Oh, God! Oh, God. Who's there? Who's there? What do you want? What do you want? Who's there? What do you want? Say something. Open the door. Open the door, Sara. Yeah. I know your name. I've been watching you for days. Start listening. Armadillo is ready. - Start menu. - Menu. Open the goddamn door! Open email. - Read email? - Write email. - Please repeat. - Write email to Blake. Email to Blake. Call the police. A man is... Look what you made me do. - Hey. - Hi. It's official - I hate New Year's Eve. Rough one, huh? I'm gonna go lie down for a couple of years. OK. Remember... Sara wants us to be there before midnight to watch the fireworks from Ryan's penthouse. What? Something not right about that guy. Danny... What'd you do? I ran a check on him. You did what? He said he was living in Philly before Brooklyn, right? According to DMV records, he was in Miami the last seven years. No, I think he said he was born in Philly. He was born in Dade County, Florida. So we'll ask him and find out. Lots of people make up stories about themselves. I know. I arrest them all the time. Shit! Oh, goddamnit! Shit. Hmm. What happened to this camera? I dropped it. Like that? You're a mess. I'm gonna clean you up. Hold still, now. You have an awesome body. It feels good, huh? Nice and cool. Please. Did Ryan ever do this for you? Huh? Wouldn't be the first time me and Ryan shared the same... - Get your fucking hands off me! - What?! What? I'm sorry. Are you OK now? Yeah. Just... These are really tight. Are you gonna help me, Sara? Yeah. Yes. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So, what did Ryan tell you about himself? - How'd he make his money? - He's an investor. Ryan wasn't an investor. Ryan was a goddamn thief. He stole something that belongs to me, and I'm here to get it back. - Where is it? - What? I don't know what you're talking about. I wonder if I believe that. I would tell you if I knew. Where's my money, Sara? Hmm? I don't want to hurt you. But I will. I'll hurt you bad. What's it gonna be, huh? An ear? Both ears? An eye? It doesn't do you any good. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me! What? I'm so cold. - Shit! - I'm really cold. - Fuck. - Please... Can I put some clothes on? Yeah. Yeah. Get dressed. Hey, Hollander. Yeah, I was just gonna call you. Yeah. It didn't exactly go down the way we planned it. The sonofabitch came at me. I had to kill him. There wasn't time. You know how fast he is. Only this time, I was faster. I know I kinda screwed up, OK? But I got the girl, and I'll get the truth if I have to carve it out of her. You don't have to do that, Hollander. I got this covered. I got this under control. Yeah, OK. OK. Goddamnit! Well, this is... this is not good, Sara. Not good for you, not good for me. Listen to me. Do you want to die today, Sara? - Is that what you want? - No. No. Then you tell me where Ryan hid the shit and maybe we both get out of this alive. - You want me to help you? - Yes. - OK. - Good. - I know where it is. - Now you're being smart. Come on, where... Ahh! Sara? You hurt me. I think it's gonna leave a scar. On, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. - Oh, God. - Sara, get down! Step back! Step back! Somebody down here? Antonio? Antonio? - Who's there? - It's Sara! There's a man down here! He killed Ryan! - Sara? - He killed Ryan! Get help! Get help! Call the police! Are you hurt? Are you alright, Sara? Please! Go back, get the police! - It's OK. - No, it's not OK! I'm not leaving you alone. No! Go back! - Stay right where you are. - Get help! I'm not leaving you, Sara. Antonio? Antonio? Antonio can't hear you anymore. Help me! Help me, anybody! Please help me! Can somebody help me? Oh, God. Oh, God. On, God. Oh, my God! Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh! Ohh! Oh! Oh, God! Help! Please! Please! Please! Help! Help! Please, help. Is somebody there? Please, I need help. - God, are you OK? - There's a man. - He's coming after me. - Can I help? - Please. - Can I help? - Yes. - My name's Robert Shay. I'm a New York City prosecutor. - Oh, God. Please. - I understand. I understand. - I need your help. - I understand. We're gonna get you somewhere safe, OK? - There's a man. - OK. I got it. - You can go. Thank you. - He's coming. OK, listen, first thing we're gonna do, we're gonna get you to a safe place, OK? Put this on. OK. OK. Everything's OK. OK. You alright? OK. - What's your name? - Sara. - OK, Sara. - Sara Frost. You're doing good. Now, Sara, I'm gonna have to call 911 and they're gonna ask me what happened. Can you tell me? - A man broke into my apartment. - Uh-huh. My boyfriend's apartment. He killed my boyfriend. Where's the apartment? 260 Blackwood, Penthouse North. OK. Now, I'm gonna have to call this in. Just a second. OK? Hi. Yeah, this is ADA Robert Shay. I'm with a young woman who's a victim of an assault. Her name is Sara Frost. Uh-huh. Yeah. Apparently, there's a homicide involved as well, at 260 Blackwood, Penthouse North. Just a second. Ah. It's the boyfriend. Yeah. OK. Oh, great. OK. Thanks. Great. I got it. Thank you very much. OK. There's a unit. It's a block away. The police are gonna meet us at the building, OK? - Thank you. - OK. Here we are. Are the police here yet? They'll be here any second. May I use your phone to call my sister, please? Sure. Is that them? - Sara. - It's him. - It's him! - I know. Oh, God. Oh! No. Very interesting day, Chad. Very interesting. Let's see - first, you killed Ryan, before we had a chance to get any information out of him. And then you let a 118-pound blind girl make a fool out of you. That's not how it happened. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's how it happened. It's exactly how it happened, Chad. Just like that. Let's face it. You're kind of a fuck-up. Aren't you? You're also a mess. Go clean yourself up. Go ahead. Go on. Look... so you know, the only thing - honestly, the only thing - standing between you and that psychopath in there is me. That's it. OK? Well. Alright, huh? Yeah, it's kinda like your own little fortress. Just you and Ryan up here where nobody can touch you. Wasn't gonna last. I was always gonna find you. Find me? Well, Ryan. And whoever else was lucky enough to be with him. What do you want? What are you gonna do? What am I gonna do? I don't know. I guess whatever it takes. That's what I'm gonna do. Whatever it takes. Wow. You know, I know you can't see this. But this view, I mean... This view is drop-dead. Hey, did you ever wonder how a young guy like Ryan could ever even afford a place like this? He had money. Yeah. He had money. Did he ever say anything about Miami? - Miami? - Uh-huh. Big city. Florida. He used to live there. Anything else? He said he got involved with some very bad people down there. Really? Yeah. Hey. Who's this? What's the name of your cat? Shadow. Shadow. Hey, Shadow. Aren't you a pretty girl? Funny. I didn't figure Ryan as a cat guy. What is wrong with you? Ryan is dead. That animal in the next room murdered him. You think you knew Ryan. Let me ask you something. If Ryan was such a choirboy, what was he doing in business with the likes of Chad and me? It's here. Somewhere. Ryan would never let it get out of his reach. He'd keep it close by. You know where it is. Don't you think I would have told that psychopath anything I knew once he put his hands on me? Chad likes the rough stuff. Ryan too, actually. Was that it? Was that your thing? I'm not judging. You don't know anything about me. See, actually, I do. Google. "Sara Frost. "Promising young photojournalist "embedded with US troops in Afghanistan." Wow. Blah-blah-blah. "Suicide bomber." Oh, boy, here we go. "Permanent blindness." Permanent blindness. Permanent. What is that like? Everything you loved, everything gone in a flash of light. Are you one of those people who thinks, "Whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger"? Is that what you think? I'd put a bullet through my head. Where is it, Sara? Ryan hid it good, Hollander, but I know it's here. Of course it's here, Chad. And if you hadn't killed him, we would've had it by now! Just give me five minutes with her, I'll get the truth. What if you lose control like you did with Ryan? - Won't happen, Hollander. - What if you kill her? I won't. OK. But do not kill her. - I mean it, Chad. - No, don't. Don't what? Don't leave me alone with him. Too late, Sara. I can't help you. Ahh! I can't kill you, but let's see how close I can get. Chad, hold it. Stop. What's wrong with this picture? - What are you talking about? - Quiet. Chad, your knuckles are dragging. I'll tell you what's wrong with this picture. This picture. Everything else in this pretentious apartment is generic, soulless, like Ryan. Everything but this photograph. - One of yours, isn't it, Sara? - Yeah. Ryan blew it up and framed it for you, right? It's haunting. Really disturbing. It's beautiful. Take it down. Why? Because I told you to. Give me your blade. Give me your knife. You have a very unhealthy attachment to this knife. Sweet! There's... there's gotta be... two, three... 300 grand. What? So you got what you came for. Will you go now? Sure. As soon as Chad bags the cash. That wasn't so bad. It worked out for everybody. - Except for Ryan. - Was it worth it? Killing him? Tell you the truth, I'm gonna miss old Ryan. He was a good investment. You talk about him like he was some sort of object, some thing. Sara, Ryan betrayed you AND me. I know what you're thinking. "If I love that guy long enough and hard enough, "I could change him." Never gonna happen. Ryan was scum. You couldn't see him for what he really was. You want me to do her? No, I don't want you to do her. - But she knows too much. - What does she know? She heard some voices and some fake names. That's all. Hey, Chad, not everything has to end up in blood, alright? Go wait for me at the door. Some other time, then, Sara. Listen. I know this was tough on you. You're a whole lot stronger than you know. Now, I don't want you to leave the apartment or call anybody for an hour, OK? An hour. Yeah, now I get it. Now I see what Ryan saw in you. How'd you know? I smelled you. She didn't lead us to shit. Shut up, Chad. We're close. Put that down, Sara. You're gonna hurt yourself. You stay away from me. Ah! You got your money. You got what you wanted. We're not here for the money, Sara. - The money's chicken shit. -Then what? What do you want? Why won't you leave me alone? Where'd Ryan say he got this diamond? He was buying diamonds. He said they were investments. Investments, my ass. - Where are the others? - The others? Yeah, I want my other 29 clear perfect diamonds. $20 million worth stolen in Miami. - Are you saying Ryan stole 'em? - Yeah, that's right. And then he doublecrossed us. Where are my diamonds? I can't help. Argh! Can't or won't? Which is it, Sara - can't or won't? No! Not yet! We need her. Hey, Shadow. Look here, who came to visit. Hiya. You hear that? You hear that purring like a little racing motor? Please... put her down. Huh? Oh, it's OK. I'm a cat lover. I love cats, and cats love me. What are you doing? What do you mean? I'm just over here, at the edge of the terrace, just once again... admiring this amazing view. What are we, 14, 15 storeys up? Careful, careful, careful. Careful, careful. Ooh, that was close. Please. Please what? Whatever you're thinking. What am I thinking? It's an innocent animal. Sara, are you trying to put some ideas in my head? Do you actually think I'm capable... - No! I just... - I told you, I'm a cat lover. I love cats. -I know. Oh, great. You're upsetting Shadow. - For God's sake... - Shadow's upset now. Where are they? The diamonds? - I don't know. - Yeah, you do. - Please don't. - Tell me where they are. - I don't know. - Sara... Just tell me where the diamonds are. I don't know. OK. Wrong answer. Shit. I wonder if she landed on her feet. Ugh! That was fucked up. - What'd you say? - That was fucked up. What did that cat ever do to you? Gee, Chad, when did you join PETA? I'm just saying. Yeah, you know... Ryan may have been a disloyal dog, but at least he knew when to keep his mouth shut. - Yeah, well, Ryan's dead. - You challenging me, Chad? I'm just saying, you want answers, you don't go throwing cats around. You know, maybe when you killed Ryan, something happened to your brain. I don't know. Why don't you go wait downstairs? What? Leave you up here alone to find the diamonds? Why? Do you think I'd sell you out? I don't know. Would you? Gee. I mean, Chad, if you don't trust me... You looking for this? Chad, I'm deeply hurt that you don't trust me. I trust you. - What? - I trust you. Yeah, but you're just saying you trust me. - Do you really trust me, Chad? - I really trust you. Phew! For a second there, I thought maybe you didn't trust me. Here's your knife. This is Tim in Traffic Watch 1. I've got somebody on the roof down there. See me, please. Please see me. I'm gonna give you one last chance. Ugh! Wave. Wave! Yeah, just two people who decided to start the party a little early. OK? Huh? Good. 'Cause we're gonna play a game called follow the cat. It's a long way down there, Sara. Ryan has a safe. Show me. Hey, honey. Um... you're not thinking of going to Sara's like that, are you? I'm not going at all. I thought we agreed. You said we'd see how I feel. Well, I feel like not going. Danny, it's 10 blocks. Listen. Your pregnant wife and your unborn son are gonna go and visit her sister. You can come or you can stay here and drink your beer and scratch your balls. Drink this. Why doesn't he just kill me? Maybe I stopped him. You're terrified of him. You're his lapdog. Like hell I am. You don't get it, do you? You have no idea what he's gonna do to you. - To me? - Do the math. $20 million divided by two? Why would Hollander cut you in when he could take it all for himself? Oh... You're way ahead of me, aren't you? I knew you were smart. You're gonna kill him first, aren't you? Drink. Help me, Chad, and I will help you. Really? And then what will you do? Whatever you want. Kill him. We gotta talk. Come on. That Ryan. Got some sense of humour. For a dead guy, I mean. Diamonds weren't in the safe, I'm guessing. Yeah. I have a feeling you knew that. Which means... ...you're my only living link to those rocks, Sara. Where's Chad? Did you kill him already? I put him outside. Give us a chance to... be alone. He's working up the nerve to kill you, you know. Yeah, he's thinking about it. You maybe even helped him... little bit. You know what, Sara? Behind that... ...very pretty face and those soft green eyes, you're not all that innocent. Are you? Let's you and I make a deal. I tell you where the diamonds are and you let me live. And as a kicker... ...I let you keep this. If you're anything like me, cash it in. I'm nothing like you. You kill people. Yeah. I mean... The world's a slaughterhouse full of pigs who are just too stupid to see when the axe comes down. Take the offer. You're making a really big mistake, Sara. You know, I can hear something in your voice that wasn't there before. Really? What's that? Desperation. Comfortable? Good. Hold her shoulders down. Please don't... Ah! Please! You know how this works? Thirsty? You're not strong enough for this, Sara. Nobody is. Why don't you just tell me what I need to know? Go to hell! Where are they? The diamonds? Where are my (Xv-Amends? Hey, it's us. A very pregnant lady is downstairs. We're right outside the building. - That's my sister. - Put some clothes on. - We're coming up! - Oh, please. Let me call her back. I can stop them. - You OK? - Mm-hm. I don't trust her. You know what that is? I won't even blink before I kill them. - Their lives for the diamonds, Sara. -Yes. Hon? You alright? You want that baby to be born, Sara? Hello? OK. Hold on. Hey, Sara. Sorry. It's not a good time to come here right now. - Why not? - I should have called. What's going on? We're in the middle of a fight. - A fight? - He didn't hit you, did he? - No. - If he laid... - No, Danny. He didn't lay... - Where is he? ...a hand on me, OK? We just need to be alone so we can work it out. OK? Well, you don't expect us to leave. It's almost midnight. We want to be here with you. Blake, please... Sara. What's going on? We're just fighting. Wh... Where's Ryan? Ryan, we need to talk, man! Right now, Ryan! I need to see your face. No, listen. This is... This is just between us. OK? We're here, we're in it, and we're not leaving. Please. Just leave. No. Sara, look, we're not gonna... Honey? Are you OK? - No. Oh, no. - Blake? - Blake? - Oh, shit. I think... on, shit. Sara, let us in and call 911. - No! - She must lie down. Let us in. - I can't. - For Godsakes, Sara... - I can't, Danny! - Stop! No, OK, Danny, stop. - Honey, you need to lie down. - No, I... Oh. Oh, shit. What I need to do is get to the hospital. OK? I'm not having this baby right here. OK, we'll get a cab. - I'll be there soon. - Yes, just... - University Hospital. - OK. I'll see you soon. Looks like you're gonna be an aunt. - What are you doing? - I'm looking for a drink. See if Ryan has any decent Scotch. With ice. Lots of ice. Alright. We kept our part of the bargain. Where are they, Sara? Ryan never told me. What? But I think I know where they are. Oh, what, you think? What is this, huh? Hey! Which part of "Make me a drink" don't you understand? Where? Terrace. Terrace. It was one night last summer. I woke up. It was about 2:00 in the morning. Ryan wasn't in bed, but I heard him making some noise out here. When I came out, I sensed something wasn't right. He said he couldn't sleep and I should go back to bed. But I could still... I could still hear him. When he came to bed, I could smell dirt on his hands, and I think... I think he was hiding something in the pots. There must be a hundred pots out here. Could take a long time, couldn't it, Sara? POT SMASHES LOUDLY Is that the idea? Huh? Kinda... run out the clock? Maybe somebody's gonna come save you, something like that? What'd you think? That I'd fucking quit? You think I'd quit and go home? Did you really think I'd quit? - I'm telling you the truth. - Shh! Shh! Shh! Move over. Over right here. Any luck? Luck? Find the diamonds? Not yet. Here. It's your drink. Where's my ice? Your ice has melted. What about my other ice? You know, the kind you get at Tiffany's. Chad... I know. You were just going to tell me. You wanted to surprise me. The diamonds? Fuck you! We both knew this day was gonna come, Chad. One of us had to go. It was always gonna be you, Chad. I wish you could see these, Sara. They're beautiful. Argh! Ohhh! Tell me. Did you know the whole time? I'm not telling you shit. Were you playing me? Huh? Were you just playing me? Ugh! Yeah. Sara? You think I can't hear you? You think I don't know where you are? Come on, Hollander, talk. I know you like to talk. What? Cat got your tongue? Argh! That was a hit, wasn't it? Alright, Hollander. Let's play. Are you watching? Keep your eye on the diamond. What do you say? Should we go for number two? Hey... Speak up. I can't hear you. Three. Should I just let 'em all go? Urgh! Don't drop them. I won't. Argh!
